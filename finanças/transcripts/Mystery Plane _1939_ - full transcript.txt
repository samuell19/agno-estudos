# We're men of the air # We never care # When e'er we leave the field # Men of the air # We never despair # To fear we never yield # Ready for flight # In the dead of the night # Over land or sea or storm # Eager to fight # We're dead in the right # We give her the gun and go # On silver wings we take the air # # Though we never like to boast # # How we dance from coast to coast # # On silver wings without a care # # Winging our way across the sky # # Where we're prepared to do or die # # Into the flying men of silver wings # # Sing it out with a voice that rings # # Into trouble anywhere # We'll be there # On silver wings Come on, give me back my book. Oh go on, take it. Yeah, you were always trying to start an argument. Yeah, good cow. Just because you got a scrapbook on the guy don't prove nothin'. If Tommy says he knows, he knows him. Careful Betty-Lou, my boil. Sure I know him. He's 25 years old. Flew with the French, then joined the Americans. Has the Croix de Guerre, the DSC, shot 10 planes and two balloons. Oh, everybody knows that. - Sure. - Sure. All right then. When did he get his first plane? Go on, when did he? Oh, you don't know that, do ya. It was in July, 1917. Oh, you could have read that too. That don't prove you know him any. Sure. Hurry, hurry, starts today at the fairgrounds. Hurry, hurry. See the famous Brandy Rand and that death-defying aerial acrobatics that brought down 12 enemy planes. See the famous Brandy Rand and that death-defying aerial acrobatics that brought down 12 enemy planes. Witness the thrilling nerve tingling delayed parachute jump. Oh no, well just wait till you see what happens at the fairgrounds this afternoon. Hurry, hurry, see the famous Brandy Rand that death-defying... Hey, Mom, watch my book for me, will ya! 12 enemy planes, starts today at the fairgrounds. Hurry, hurry, see Brandy Rand, the greatest of the great. He flies upside downside up, he flies, the most stupendous, colossal exhibition you have ever witnessed. Hurry, hurry, starts today at the fairgrounds. Hurry, hurry. Now ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Approaching the field from the north is that death-defying, gravity-denying hero here, that famous war-time ace, Captain Brandy Rand. Attention ladies and gentlemen, in just one moment, Captain Brandy Rand will thrill you with an exhibition of aerial acrobatics such as only he can give. Come on! Every movement with which this remarkable flier brought down enemy planes will be performed before your very eyes. Watch him, folks! Don't take your eyes off him for a moment. Come on! And now ladies and gentlemen, at 2,000 feet Captain Rand will do his famous delayed parachute jump. Dropping like a plummet to within 500 feet of the ground and certain death before opening his parachute. He will carry a sack of flour on the way down so that you can trace his dramatic descent. Watch him now, watch him, the one and only Brandy Rand! What's he doing now? He's getting out on the wing. What's he doing now? Getting ready to jump. Ready, hand me the flour. Careful now, there's a lot of wind down there. Hold everything tight. Here goes nothin'. Good luck, Skipper. What now? He jumped! What's that? He opened the chute. He's so high! Tommy, Tommy, wait for me! - He all right? - Sure. Tommy, Tommy, wait for me! Just a minute, I'm coming, Brandy, hold it! Hold on, Brandy, I'm comin', just a minute! Hold on! Hiya, soldier. Hiya, Brandy! Boy, that was some jump. You didn't have a sack of flour that time over the Argonne though, did ya. Boy, I bet that some kick to come shootin' down like that. Nothin' like divin' on a balloon though, is it. You got the DSC for that, huh. You seem to have me pegged pretty well. Sure, Brandy, I know all about ya. Maybe you know, I never got a medal for swimming and this parachute weighs a ton. Oh, gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Okay. Gee, Brandy, this is just like the time you passed through no-man's land. Was wet in that shell hole too, wasn't it. Yeah, it sure was. Had to stay there all night, didn't ya. Yeah, we're gonna be here all night, too, if you don't hurry up. Say, why do they call ya, Brandy. Oh, I don't know, unless some people say I used to be kind of friendly for a guy named Cognac. Hey, Skipper! Hey, there he is now. Come on, bend those arms while I get this parachute off. What's going on here? Look at you, soakin' wet. You oughta... Yeah, I oughta have somethin' that can keep the cold out. Sure, give him a cup of coffee and get him a blanket and help me get this chute in the truck. Oh, ah, meet my pal, ah? Tommy Tompkins. Yeah, Tommy Tompkins, Tex Raferty, my man Friday. Hiya, Kit. Hi, soldier. Tommy, are you all right? 'Course. You gotta be more careful, Captain. When you wait that long with a parachute, you got no control. You can't tell where you're gonna land. I wanted to do something extra special for the soldier here. You always brag. What do you think of it, sir? Quite a place you've got here, Tommy. Say, what's that? This is my training ship. I made it out of my own bicycle. Want to try her? Yeah, I'll try out your handle. Okay, Tommy, here goes nothin'. Good luck, Skipper. Why got that too, eh? Yeah, I got that. Switch on. Switch on! - Contact. - Contact! Okay, okay, I gotta rev her up a bit. That's nice, run forward. Here we are. 1,600, all right coming, pull the blocks out. Okay, boy, grab that right wing, we gotta turn into the wind. - Okay. - Okay. Full throttle, here we go, boy. Let her go, right in the wind. Here we go, boy, right down the field. We're got a flying streak now. Head forward, you say, got the tail up. Up. All right, the tail's up, we're pulling her back now. All right, the wheels are off. Forward a little left, you see. Now we're level flying flight, we'll pull her back a little more. We're at the end of the field, now we're gonna turn around the field. All the way around the field, back into the wind you see. Here we go, boy. Boy it's fast. Yeah. All right, right back in the wind. Here we go. All right, now, pull your throttle back. There we are. Now we're gliding into a landing. Head the field. All right, we're near the ground. Only three, two feet. Stalled right in, Three Point, here we are! Right back where we started from. Hey, where's my hat. Oh, there it is. Say, what's that. THat's where I keep all my dope on ya. Look. Remember your first plane. Hm. Remember the Croix de Guerre and the French general kissin' ya? Look, here's a picture of ya. General Bollard gives you the DSC after the Argonne. Here's another picture of your ship after those three enemy planes shot you down. Boy, you had me worried then. Then I got this picture of ya in hospital, read you were okay. Gee, kid, I kind of wish I knew you were rootin' for me like that. Yeah. Gettin' late, I guess I better run along. Wait a minute and I'll go with ya. No, no, you stay here and learn how to make those takeoffs, huh. You know, Tommy, you got the makings of a flier yourself. Gee, do you think so? You just keep right in there punchin'. Goodnight, Brandy. Golly. Ireland, why, Brandy could have flown there backwards. He was the greatest pilot in the world. Why he could take some tissue paper and chicken wire and do things with it that today's pilots haven't even touched. I know how you feel. Jim Corbett was my idol. Say, I came pretty near being a prize fighter. I always knew I wanted to fly. When Brandy came to town and took me, I was gone. Whatever happened to him? Darned if I know. After those five days in Jefferson City, he just disappeared. I haven't seen or heard of him in 15 years. Well, that's the way it goes. People make an indelible impression on our lives and then they're gone. Sometimes I wish I'd followed my hunch and been a prize fighter instead of trying to manage an independent airport. You don't mean that, Paul. Why, we're practically out of the woods. And the mail contracts keep us going, and after Thursday when they show the army our bombing device. After Thursday we'll still be broke. - Broke? - Yeah. The army has finally consented to see a test and we need $300 to get it ready. Whew, 300 bucks. Well, that's not so much. Oh, it is to me. Why I haven't even paid last month's wages to you and Skeeter and Betty-Lou. # Anywhere we go, anywhere # Now we'll be there # On silver # Did you saw silver # Yes, I said silver # On silver wings Well done, what's this? Food, wolf powder. Sprinkle one can on the wolf at your door and he runs howling into the night. Now, calm down you two and tell us what's happened. Well. Go ahead. Well, she wanted flying lessons. Who? - When. - Where. - Why. - Now take it easy. Today, this afternoon. Here at 3:00 p.m. A dream, a vision. A girl. Yes, a girl. No, an angel. Oh, he's off again. Please, Betty-Lou, we're dying and you want to tell riddles. A girl drove up this afternoon and wanted flying lessons. And naturally I handled the situation. Naturally. With my usual charm and diplomacy. She signed for the course. And paid 100 smackers in advance. 100! 10 of which we spent for the food, Pappy, and 90 of which goes in the kitty. 90! Then we only need 210. 190, it's my mad money. I dug it out of my shoe today. Listen kids, it's an omen. It's more than that, it's a miracle. We're in! We sure are. If I can't raise 200 bucks after this, my name isn't Paul Smith. The bombing device, the bombing device. # We're going to show the bombing device # # The bombing device # We're going to show the bombing device # # So early Thursday morning Look what we got here. # We're going to show the bombing device # # The bombing device How does it look to you, Commander? I'd say that's approximately the outline of a battleship. Have a look, Colonel. You certainly have chosen an ideal place for this test, Mr. Smith. That dark spot over there is an excellent background for the target. And those hills afford excellent observer protection. Tompkins to field set. Tompkins to field set, go ahead. Field set to Tompkins, go ahead. Hello, Betty-Lou, here goes nothin'. Okay, Tommy, good luck. Thanks. It has worked in the shop. Yes, but we find quite a difference between tests made in miniature under ideal conditions and tests made under actual flying conditions. But the principle is the same, sir. This represents the target. And here is our position here at this observation post. Our radial beam from Three Point, is directed over the target. Another beam, from our position here, bisects the target at this angle. The bomber flies on this beam from Three Point and when it reaches the spot where the two beams intersect over the target, the bombs are automatically released. You mean the man flying the plane has nothing to do with it. Has nothing to do with releasing the bombs. Of course, he knows when he's over the target. There's an instrument in the cockpit with an illuminated dial on which are two arrows. One arrow is the flying beam, the other is the target beam. As he approaches the target, the arrows register the converging beams. And when the two arrows come together, they... The bombs are automatically released and kablooie. We hope. Well, we'll see. I don't mind telling you this. The government is much more sympathetic to a thing of this kind than the general public is lead to believe. Yes, sir. Yes, and we're not giving you any of the best of it in this test, Mr. Smith. No, if it works at 30,000 feet, it will most certainly have our hearty recommendation. Tompkins to field set, Tompkins to field set, go ahead. Field set to Tompkins, go ahead. Put Paul on, will ya. They're on the flying beam. Paul speaking, target beam in yet. Not yet, sir. Yes, sir, just coming in. Good. In your altitude and remember we want a report on what happens up there. Okay, chief, we're 18,000 climbing steadily. Good luck, boys. What do you make of it, Captain? Looks like an improvised bomber. Well, you'd better keep an eye on him. Their observation post seems to be pretty well hidden. There they are. Looks like an aerial. Yeah, must be talking to the bomber. Just going on oxygen. Yeah, that pilot, whoever he is, sure knows how to handle her. That's a lad they call Tailspin Tommy. That the one that's gonna give you lessons? No, it's Milligan, a friend of his. Yeah, you don't want to slip up on that angle. When have I ever? 29,000 feet, our oxygen's giving out. Go on back to the field, Tommy. Don't take a chance. Getting pretty close to home. Don't do it, Tommy, come on back. Almost there. Okay, Paul, we've dropped. Tommy! Keep talking, are you all right? Hey look, that bombers in trouble! Oh, they made it. Come on! There, my friend, is a flier. That's one of the greatest pieces of flying I've ever seen. And you've seen them all, right, Captain. - Yeah. - Yeah. Come on, we got things to do. Hang on, boss. That a boy, put your leg over. Now. - Oh, Skeeter, wake up! - Oh! - How you doin'? - Huh? Oh, swell! Hey, where are we? Oh, the last time I remember anything, I was chasing you across a little pink cloud. Boy, you don't look a day older. - Look. - Look, look, look. Tommy, oh goodness! Great show, Tommy, great job, Skeeter. - What happened? - What's happened. Tell 'em, Colonel. Two direct hits, I'd hate to have been on the battle wagon. Yay! The whole property on the international scene. The United States is notoriously slow to take advantage of improvements in armaments. With the device now our possession, well, we have an offer for half million now. Where do you think the trading will stop when those other nations start bidding? Sounds good to me. Me too. To wrap up, how 'bout you, Cap? Count me out. All right, I don't mind smuggling in a few aliens or flying contraband or any of the other things I've been in on. But when it comes to stealing something from Uncle Sam to use against it. We understand, Brandy, but you're quibbling. Any one of those aliens you smuggled in might be more of a menace to Uncle Sam than this thing. Yeah, they might. Then again they might be good citizens. Ah, this thing can only be used one way. For destruction. All right, go on and smile. But I know what I'm talkin' about. So I say, let Uncle Sam keep it. At least we know he won't use it to drop surprise packages on women and children. He's gone, have another drink, Captain. - Well. - Thanks. Guess I'll be shoving off. So long, Captain. So long, Anita. All set? Sure, I'm having dinner with him. What about the Captain? Don't worry about him. A few more drinks and he'll be kicking the gong around. And just think, Tommy, by this time tomorrow you'll be famous. Pictures in the paper and... Wait a minute, not so fast. Well, Paul's down talking to the army people, isn't he? Sure, but it all takes time. Even if it's all set, there'll be nothing in the papers. This isn't like a new sewing machine, it's a weapon. A terrible weapon, something to make aggressive nations keep their hands off us. But you will be making a lot of money, won't you? I mean, enough so that you'll have time for something besides work. Sort of, well you know, time for something like, well, like going places and having fun and... Sure, Betty-Lou, I know. But I have fun just being here with you and Paul and Skeeter. It's not a question of money, it's doing something and following it through, something we started right here. Putting Three Point on the map and making Paul's airline something to be reckoned with. You understand, don't you. Of course, Tommy. You are now entering the nice home of Tailspin Tommy. Why here they come and I haven't finished setting the table. Sound the cymbals, beat the drums, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Anita. I'll take her. Oh no, you won't, I'll take her. As long as you've got me over here to cook dinner, I'm going to be boss. Come on, I'll show you where to take off your jacket. Well, how do you like her. Fine, how am I supposed to? Fine, but not too fine. Remember, I'm the fair-haired boy in this spot. She's crazy for me. She must be. There you go, death to romance. But in this breast beats a heart, not an airplane motor. Hey, have you heard from Paul. Well, he's still in conference with the brass hats down at the fort. That reminds me, look. Look, what would happen if we relieve a little of this tension on this coil spring here. Great Scott, man, two direct hits and you're not satisfied. Maybe we can make it three. And now gentlemen, prepare yourselves for the feast. Yeah, I know, you mean hamburgers. Well, well. You should have seen Tommy's face. Oh, let's forget about that. Have you been interested in flying very long, Anita? Oh, not very. I've been up several times and, well, I decided to learn to fly myself. Well you certainly came to the right place. Now when I get through with ya, you'll know all there is to know. Well, about flying I mean. We're sure you do. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, speaking. This is headquarters at the fort. I'm speaking for Mr. Paul Smith. He wants to know if you can come down here. Sure, right away. It's from Paul Smith, I'm wanted at army headquarters. Boy, that's action for ya, what do you suppose it is? Maybe he wants to make a couple generals out of us. I'll drive you over. Okay, lets go, bye, gals. Good luck, Tommy. Sorry, sugar, but I'll be seeing ya. I'm sure you will. I hope the general hasn't got a mustache. What? I hope the general hasn't got a mustache. I've never been kissed by a mustache. Have you gone crazy? Well they kiss ya when they pin the medal on ya, don't they? We're not gonna get the medal, you can sure dream up some honey. What do you mean, no medals? Don't we get any medals? Here they come. What's up? Your number if you don't do what you're told to. Hey, who do you think you're foolin'? You're barking up the wrong tree boys, we haven't got a dime. Yeah, that's what you think. Move over. Get in the back, Fred and keep 'em covered. How 'bout your car. I'll pick it up. - Hey, where you takin' us. - Aw, shut up. All right, get aboard. Oh, thanks a lot. It's all right. That's the worst thing about giving a dinner is doing the dishes afterwards. I do hope the boys hurry, I have to be on the job in the morning. Oh, we'll be hearing from them pretty soon. You've known them a long time. Oh, I've known Skeeter about three years. Tommy and I were raised together. He's the head man. Oh, ever since kindergarten. Hello. Oh, just a minute. It's for you. Oh, I told my people where I'd be, I guess they're getting worried. Hello? This is Carl. Are you all set? Yes, I was just leaving, yeah, good night. Sorry, I'll have to go. Oh, I suppose I should too. But, I hate to leave without hearing from Tommy. Oh, they may be in an all-night session. He'll call you, won't he? Come on, my car is outside and I'll take you home. Perhaps that would be best. Tommy has the car and would you mind? No, not at all. It's really very simple. You have a valuable bombing device, which you demonstrated very cleverly today. We want it. And how do you expect to get it. I expect you to outline the essential details for us. And if we don't? I hadn't even considered that possibility. I know when we present our argument, you'll readily agree that there's nothing else to do under the circumstances. You're taking in a lot of territory, mister. We don't scare easy. Now we don't want to have any trouble about this. Let's not have any flag waving. We're in the business that has nothing to do with patriotism. You have something that we need, we intend to get it. I'm sure you understand, Mr. Tompkins. No, I'm afraid I don't. I don't understand how a man like you, an American evidently. Born in New York City. Would want knife the country he was born in, no matter how much was involved. You're a pretty smart fellow, I guess, Winslow, you must have this all figured out. Maybe I'm dumb, but I believe when you live in a country and accept its benefits, you kind of owe something to it. Now we can save a lot of time if you cut out the preliminaries. You're not going to get any information out of me. And if you think you can, why, let's get started. And that goes for me too, doubled in spades. # Onward home, the land of liberty # # Never hoist out at the top of the # Excuse me. Brandy! Boy, I'm glad to find you! We're you been, what's doin'. Skeeter, it's Brandy, everything's all right. Boy, have I got things to tell you and am I glad to see you. Fixing up a stunt like this. You old son of a gun. Have I got things to tell you. Brandy, don't you know me? I'm Tommy Tompkins, Jefferson City, 1923. I was a kid, you were barnstorming, remember? You fell in the lake. Oh, Tommy, sure. Oh Tommy. Tommy, sure. Oh, why, why look at the size of him. You remember that training plane you had in your room? Sure. Hey, that was you flying the bomber today, wasn't it. Sure, me and Skeeter. Come here, Skeeter, shake hands with Brandy. Hello, Brandy. Boy, you're a sight for sore eyes. Sorry to break in, but uh. Oh, sorry, this is a friend of mine from a long time ago. So I gathered. But your friend seems to be under a misapprehension as to why we're here. Why, it's a joke, isn't it. Well, hardly. Maybe you'd better explain to him, Cap. No, Tommy, it's no joke. These men are really serious. They'll stop at nothing. Oh, Tommy, I'd rather take the worst beating in the world than have you find me like this. Oh, I know I'm all through, Tommy, I'm all washed up. Oh, but you're just a kid, you got your whole life before ya. Give them what they want, huh. Sound advice. There'll be other days. Think of all you've got to live for. Yeah, and all I got to live for. Well, it's a whole lot less than it was a minute ago. Brandy, for 15 years you were the greatest thing in the world to me. I tried to talk like you, I wanted to look like you, I wore my hat cocked over one eye like you. Used to do everything I did, I tried to do it just like you'd do it. My one ambition was to be the second best flier in the world. You'll always be best. I don't know what you've been through or what they've done to you to bring you to this. But they're not gonna do it to me. You want that device, and I'm the only one that can give it to ya. All right, let's see you get it. Very pretty, son, but the Captain's explained that we're playing for big odds. I'm going to get the device. Yeah, what makes you think so. This. Well, Tommy. Now, please, now let's not have any more heroics. We have no idea of putting your fortitude to the test. However, I can't think you'd want the young lady to suffer. Well, there's a drawing board and square, micrometer, angles and instruments. Just sketch a diagram, the working principles of the device and assure you, no one will be harmed. Naturally we want time enough to check your figures. In the meantime, you're our guest. No, now, it's getting late. I know you want time to go to work. Oh, after you my dear Captain. Goodbye. Of course the boys will see that you're not disturbed. Here's your weather report Three Point. Clear with continued moderate temperatures. Ceilings and visibility will remain unlimited. Maybe you're right. Maybe the youngsters are only out celebrating, Colonel. But if so, it's the first time they've ever done it without letting me know. - Well, all right, Mr. - Smith, we'll do our best. The War Department is vitally interested in this thing too, you know, or I wouldn't have dragged Captain Walker out. Three Point, Paul Smith talking. It's for you. Walker, six three. Right. There's two messages to Tompkins' quarters from a public phone on the beach highway last night. Beach highway. Yes, of course that doesn't prove anything. We can check the neighborhood of the phone for possible identification. Whatever you think best. Now wait a minute. If these kids are in a jam, I don't want anything done from this end that'll backfire on them. We won't worry about that till we're sure of what's happened. I know it's tough, fella, but life's full of disappointments like that. Look at me, I thought I had Anita eating out of my hand. I wonder how they got Betty-Lou here. I don't know, same way they got us, I guess. We sure walked into it, didn't it. Sure did, and checking back, I don't see how we could have done it any different. It was so natural that, well I... Okay, boys. Good morning, gentlemen, sorry to disturb you. Oh, that's all right, it's all right, we weren't going any place. Well, that is, not right away. Go ahead and grin. But don't let me catch you without these playmates of yours or I'll knock your ears down. I think I will anyway. Ah, sit down. Why! Shouldn't let him read those cheap magazines. It's all right, Carl. I've come up to take you for a little walk. Yeah, why. I want you to talk to your friends at Three Point. Now, please, boys, don't get any childish ideas. You're going to tell them that you're all right, not to worry and that you'll be back in a few days. Now what makes you think we're gonna do a thing like that? Oh, do we have to go through all that again? You certainly do, you're not gonna get anything out of us without a battle. Pipe down, Skeet. Okay, Winslow, let's go. Oh, so you're knuckling down to these guys, huh? Oh, you. Tompkins to Three Point, Tompkins to Three Point, go ahead, Three Point. Three Point to Tompkins, Three Point to Tompkins, Three Point to Tompkins, come ahead Tommy. Get over there and see if that is Tompkins. If it is, keep him on. Hiya, Chuck, put Paul on will ya. Gee, Tommy, I'm glad to hear from ya. What's doin'? Skeeter, Betty-Lou and I are down at the beach in a seaplane with some friends. Don't worry about us, we'll be home in a couple of days. Put directional finder on message PB148, Three Point. Right. Well, wish you'd let me know, I'd have gone with ya. Well, we decided in quite a hurry. I get it. What's Skeeter, best man? Huh, yeah, sort of. Well, hold everything kid. Here goes nothin'. Ah, take it easy, Paul. Okay, Cap? Sounded okay to me. Well, let's get back to work. Joe, take care of Brandy. Okay. How ya feelin', Cap? Hm, oh, okay. You sure were plastered last night. Yeah, wasn't I though. I brought a little hair of the dog for ya. Oh, thanks. I'll have a snort. I'm gonna stretch out back here. If you need me, holler. I thought the sketch would be complete by now. I told you you weren't gonna get anything out of us without a fight. Who do you think you're playin' with, a bunch of... What was that? Oh, some of the boys talkin' to Tommy's girlfriend. Of course it'll all stop when Tommy starts to work. Okay, Winslow, you win. But bring her in here where I can keep an eye on her. I guess that can be arranged. I'm certain. If he'd been all right, he'd have said, "Okay, Skipper, good luck." We'll have a check in just a moment from the directional finder. That'll locate the spot the message was coming from. Walker, six three. Yes. Thanks. 20 miles at sea, north, northwest. Sounds like San Leandro Island. Let's take a look. All right, shove off. Mm-mm, better leave her alone, she'll get you into trouble. I've always said nice things about you. Hey, Skeeter, come here. You remember the tension on that coil spring? Yeah, I think so. Is that about it? Yeah, that's it. Oh, can you spare a cigarette? Sure. Stop it! Where do we go from here? There's an old biplane in the hanger, let's get it. Come on, Betty-Lou. - Help, help! - Untie them. They got the biplane. Come on! Hurry up! Out like a light, wouldn't you, come on, Cap, wake up, wake up! Come on, we gotta catch that biplane. Catch a biplane. Step on it, here comes company. Company. Come on, come on. There they go! Send for help! Where are you headed? Avoiding that speedboat down there full of cops. Oh you're not going on with that, are you? Forget about the cops. Pull up alongside your friend, Tailspin Tommy, tell him to head for the naval and sit down. Bad? Three Point. Here, get on the air to him, tell him to change his course. Brandy to Tompkins. Brandy to Tompkins, Brandy to Tompkins. Go ahead, Brandy. Head for the mainland and set her down. I can't, Brandy, you know that. Please do, you haven't got a chance. Winslow's got you covered. It won't do any good if he can't hit me. Please, Tommy, think of your pal and that girl. They'd rather have it this way, Brandy. Quit stalling. You gave him his choice. All right, let 'em have it. You got a DSC for that, didn't ya. You seem to have me pegged pretty well. Kind of wish I knew you were rootin' for me like that. What you've been through, what they've done to bring you to this. They're not going to do it to me. Hold everything, Tommy, here goes nothin'. Let go of it! Brand, Brand! Come on, let go, let go! Okay, Skipper, good luck. Here they come, a whole squadron, equipped with your bombing device. You should be very proud. Hey kids! Look, I just got a wire from Hollywood. A movie company wants to make a war picture here at Three Point, and they'd like us to furnish the planes and pilots. What do you say? Oh, boy, that's great. Can you imagine me with those movie queens? Yes, I can imagine. So how 'bout you, Tommy. We can dig up the planes, and we can sure use the money. I say let's take a whirl at it. All right, I'll wire 'em to come on, they'll be here in three weeks. Well. That's the next one, "Tailspin Tommy in the Movies."
