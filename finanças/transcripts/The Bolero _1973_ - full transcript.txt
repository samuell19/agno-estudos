(metal clamoring) - Now that's the high one there so we'll have to put that in the percussion section. I want eight in this first row. One two three four five six. Then we can go to the black chairs. - [Voiceover] So the Schoenberg Concerto I will do twice, on Thursday morning and Wednesday afternoon, on the two-hour rehearsal? - [Voiceover] Yes. - [Voiceover] Okay. Wednesday morning will be all Stravinski. - Do you take a full rehearsal for the Mozart on Tuesday? - [Voiceover] No. - But that would save us some money. - We have four rehearsals, may I borrow this please? - [Voiceover] Places. (violin strings being strummed) (tuba playing scales) (violin tuning) (french horn playing scales) (violin playing scales) (flute playing) - [Voice] Are we gonna do Balero again I wonder? - [Voiceover] What? - [Voiceover] If we do Ciganche we do Balero again you know our record will be out it will be-- - Balero again? After tonight I never want to look at that piece ever again. Ever again. - People ask you know "well why do you wanna play in a symphony?" and it's it combines the fact that you can do something creative and you can work with something you love to do and be involved in an art and yet make a living at it. - Don't like it? It's all I've ever done all my life so-- I guess I like it. - Takes a little bit of talent and a lot of work. - I have a degree in business and I thought I might sell bonds but I'm glad it didn't work out that way. - Started right out with the horn and you know, made it easy because I'd already decided when I was in high school that I wanted to do it so I didn't have any trouble. - What sort of medicine? Pre-med. - [Voiceover] Got sidetracked? - Got sidetracked in horn playing. - Oh I think music is one of the greatest experiences you can have, to bring harmony, especially in a symphony orchestra. Harmony and melody and I've even left the house a little irritated at my wife shall we say, and come to the symphony and after the first few chords it just seems to go away, it's beautiful. It does get to you. Beautiful music. - There is a certain challenge which is in no other piece really, because the way Bolero builds up is not even compared to any Beethoven or Brahms symphony ending or something because those are normal natural stratos at the end of movements. Bolero's strato starts from the first bar, and continues so the-- Keeping up the tempo, keeping the really the pace and not going forward in Bolero at the end, not giving into your instinct which pushes you always, and to hold this back that's the tough part. I have seen performances of her, performances of Bolero where the side drum for instance in the middle of the piece is already at its peak. You can't do anything about it, therefore then the conductor can't bring him down and build him up again, it's got to be done very very carefully. We will start from the beginning and I would like a few of the first woodwind entrances. (orchestra begins playing) - Bolero starts out of course with just one big flute solo, and it's very soft but it must project. That one little instrument you gotta project. So it's very slow and very steady and you must keep it moving all the time. So it starts out: (flute begins playing) So it's very quiet you see? And then what Ravel has done is just build up and build up on this one tiny little theme this one very soft tone color 'till at the end you're just crashing. - Mrs. Jives. Can you actually hear the--? - [Mrs. Jives] He's awfully soft. - Awfully soft, alright. Just play a little more of the bar before she comes because she doesn't quite enter right with you. (orchestra begins playing) - We must listen more because the conductors here, flute player's over there. Well we can't very well look over there and look at the conductor and play at the same time. That is done with the visual part looking at the conductor and listening to the flute, flute player listening to me. And this is the way we have this collaboration, it works so well. - The flute in the beginning plays it almost as if it's coming from a backstage, as if the wind is bringing the tune in. - [Voiceover] That's very sexy. - Yeah and the bassoon plays it out. Bassoon actually makes it the sexiest. (orchestra playing) - The solo in the Bolero is considered one of the more noticeable solos because it's practically by itself and it's very extended. And there aren't many works written for the bassoon that are that extended and that exposed. So for that reason it's considered difficult. And also because it's quite high and the fingerings are tricky and then when you're under pressure it... gets you nervous so it's considered a hard solo. It's easy in your own bathroom or bedroom, but when you get in front of all your colleagues, and in front of an audience and then in front of the tape machine where they say "One time through this'll have to be it", then you get nervous. (bassoon playing) And so on. That's the hardest part of the solo. And see how easy it is when I'm all by myself? - There's a little bit too much difference between the dynamic of the clarinet to the bassoon. Can you just enter a little softer? Alright because we are still on the third entrance. Let's do once more the clarinet to the bassoon. That's two before two. (orchestra begins playing) The conductor has got to calculate at each verse let's say how much each one has to give. For instance when the violins first come in which is really the 18th time the flute's played, we must not bring in the violins at full strength, because they're going to play four times themselves. Two-ty. Two before 16. (music begins playing) - When our entrance does come, if I just sit there and go: (plays on violin) Well, you're going to find the whole section doing that. Whereas if when the entrance comes you go: (plays on violin) You will find that they will all come in and you'll get that tremendous sound from the string section. - Alright let's start at 12 again. Twelve. Twelve right yea. You were perfect. (orchestra begins playing) Okay. And it's not only the melody that's important. For instance when the flute finishes, the second flute comes in on a G. As soon as the second flute ends the G, the bassoon takes up the same G, which is to a layer if it's played well you will not even notice the difference of instrument. A low flute and a high bassoon... harmonically has probably the same amount or very close the same amount of harmonics, overtones. And it's very difficult when a bassoon player really plays a very fat top G and a flute player plays a fat low G. To have this connection. So it's not, it's also the buildup is going on in the accompaniment as well as in the theme. And that is I think the problem or the challenge that a conductor faces before Bolero.
