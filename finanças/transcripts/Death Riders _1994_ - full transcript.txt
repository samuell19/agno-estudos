(silence) (motorcycles rumbling) (energetic rock music) (upbeat rock music) - Man, the first thing I'm gonna do is chug down a couple gallons of brew. - Munch, we don't want any trouble, you got me? - Yeah, sure, yeah, I got you. - I just have to make a phone call. (upbeat rock music) (laughing and chattering) (glass shattering) - Hey, it missed. It's cool, man. - Skin, get us two pitchers of beer and make sure it's cold. (laughing and chattering) - Two pitchers of beer. (sniffing) - Knock it off, I don't want you gettin' out of control. (laughing and chattering) Okay, now, get me a newspaper, and not some rag either. - Where can I get a newspaper? - [Bartender] Across the street. - Thanks. - Hey, mama! Hey, baby! Come on over here. (smooches) Come here. - What? (smooching) - Come here, baby. - Let's go. (smooching) - What's the matter? - Shut up! (energetic rock music) Yeah, Freedman, Williams, and Levitt Inc., give me Mark Levitt. I don't care if he's in a meeting, get him out. Tell him it's Reaper. My first name? Grim, Grim Reaper, now, get him. Levitt, you schmuck, what the hell is with my stock? What do you mean down a little? It's in the crapper! Now, you listen to me, man, if it's not back up in a week, me and my friends are gonna pay a little visit to your wife. Think she can handle three at a time? (people chattering) - Wade Olson? Is your name Wade Olson? - Olson, we've got a bench warrant for your arrest. Keep your hands on the bar and stand up nice and slow. (men grunting) - Man, did you see that? He put his foot right in that pig's face! - Okay, we're outta here? - Why? - Because in 10 minutes, this place is gonna be crawling with heat. You wanna stay? Where are you riding, hardass? - Straight to hell, the same as you. (motorcycles rumbling) - You bastard! (laughing) (glass shattering) (energetic rock music) (motorcycles rumbling) (chattering) - Those cops in L.A., what did they want you for? - They impounded my bike, but I impounded it back. - That's it? - Well, there's a little bit more. - You got any money? - Nope. - Maybe you can make some. (soft guitar music) - Hey, man. What you did to them pigs in the bar, I dug it! Where'd you learn that stuff, man? - I studied it for 15 years with a zen master, then I snapped his neck. (laughing) - Ow! - What's the problem, Ronny? Your back hurt? (laughs) - Hey, Wade, what's wrong with your bike? - Ever since the pigs had it, it don't feel right. - They sure know how to fuck things up, don't they? - Who? - Pigs, dammit. - I hate 'em. - Hey, man, can you imagine what the world would be like without the pigs? - No law and order. - Paradise. (soft guitar music) (fire crackling) - Wade, you're gonna ride with us today. - What's going down? - Business transaction, two-hour ride. - What's in it for me? - 100 bucks and six grand, except you might have to earn it. Twice before, some asshole's tried to take this shit. - [Wade] What happened? (laughing) (car rumbling) (lively music with man singing in Spanish) (car creaking) (mysterious music) (pensive music) - Hey, man, watch this guy. He's a magician. - What do you use to cut it with? - Anything I can, man. I don't give a fuck. Mostly, I use baby laxative, but I've used Epsom salt, baking soda, and soap too. People don't give a shit if their nose rots out, as long as they get high. - Hey, Nose, give me a hit, huh? - You got your own, Munch. - Aw, come on, man, I'm out. - [Nose] You're always out. - [Man] Yeah, out of your mind. - [Man] He never had a mind. - You ever seen that much coke before? - [Wade] Maybe. Reaper do coke? - Never touches it. He says it burns out a man's spirit, whatever that means. ♫ I'm a shotgun, ooh ♫ Goin' out of my head ♫ I'm shakin' all over ♫ But not in there ♫ I'm gonna say it one time, oh ♫ I won't say it again ♫ You're too much for me, lady ♫ Oh, this is the end ♫ It's too late to be my lover ♫ I gotta stop (laughing and chattering) (hooting) - Bakersfield, 10 pounds. Santa Cruz, six pounds. Fresno, four pounds. What's this? Ukiah, 10 pounds. All right. Let's go. - Hey! How many times you get picked up tonight? (chattering) (tense music) (ominous music) - Remember, no mistakes! Make sure it snows this Christmas. See you in Vegas! (ominous music) Here's where you're making your Vegas deliveries tonight. This one's a hotel. Don't worry, it's a dump. You'll fit right in. This one's a bar. This one's a parking lot, don't fuck it up. - I'm droppin' my shit off and I'm headin' straight downtown. They got some hookers on Fifth Street that'll do anything you want, and I mean anything. (laughs) - Yeah, well, first, I'm hittin' the bars. - Man, you can drink here! I'm goin' out to party. - Come on! (motorcycle rumbling) (tense music) (rattling) (wind blowing) - Hello, anyone here? - Uh, I don't think we're supposed to be in here. (tense music builds) (motorcycles rumbling) (hiccups) (laughing) - Man, we wasted the whole day. We gotta do something. - Go back to the car. - We can't, it's dead. (laughing) - [Woman] We've gotta wait for those people. They left their stuff, so they must be coming back. (motorcycles rumbling) (lively music with woman singing) - What the hell's that? - Sounds like a party. - Let's find out. ♫ My heart's on fire ♫ I got a reason to believe - Well! It's about time you got home. - Yeah. Who are you? - Turn off the music. Well, well, well, what do we got here? Give me some light. - Oh, man, like, this is too much! (laughs) - Excuse me, are you in charge here? You see, we had a little trouble with our car, and we got lost, and we walked all day, and then we found this place. (shushing) - From now on, I tell you when to talk. (women gasping) - [Woman] Please, don't hurt us. - Hurt you? Now, look at us. Do my people look like the kinda guys that would do somethin' like that? (laughing) - Hey, Reaper, what are we gonna do with 'em? (tense music) - Everything. (wind blowing) - My father has a lot of money. He will pay you to let us go. - I got lots of money too. Munch, where are your manners? Aren't you gonna offer the ladies anything? Don't you puke, or I'll shoot ya! - Well, are we gonna party, man, or what? - Yeah, we still got time before Simon's flight. Reptile, bring out the worms. - What are you gonna do to us? - We're gonna play a little game, Heather. (women crying) You like games. Don't you wanna play with me, Heather? Didn't your father ever play games with you, Heather? Say, "Yes, Reaper." - (crying) Yes, Reaper. - Yeah! - Whoa! - Yeah! (woman screaming) - Shut her up! Nobody seems to like snakes, but they're actually perfect creatures, right, Reptile? - [Reptile] Right, Reaper. - Some people think they're dangerous, but every move they make is programmed by God. (Reptile laughing menacingly) (women screaming) - [Munch] Oh, yeah! Oh, look at that! (men laughing) Look at that one, man! - What's your name? - Her, her! (women screaming) - It's a party! - Kim! (women screaming) (energetic rock music) (woman crying) - Now you're ready. (screaming) (energetic rock music) (motorcycle rumbling) (thudding) - Shit! What do you want me to do with her? - Take her back inside. Let's wrap it up, we gotta meet Simon's plane. Curtis, take 'em back in the schoolhouse and keep 'em there. Reptile, put your pets away. (grunts) (energetic rock music) (ominous music) (motorcycles rumbling) - What are we gonna do? - Run away? - Where? - Even if we could get away, what's the difference? The car's still dead and we're still lost in the middle of nowhere. - Well, what do you think they're gonna do to us? - Maybe they'll fix our car. - [Woman] Linda, they're hell's angels, for Christ's sake! - Worse! (women gasp) (shushing) Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I ain't with them. They don't know I'm here so keep quiet. - Who are you? - Name's Jake. I'm a prospector. - So, Reaper, this is the last one for ya, huh? - Yeah, after tonight, you and Needles can make your own deal with Simon. I'm off to Mexico. - We're off to Mexico. - [Man] Hey, man, are you sure you can live down there? You're gonna be bored shitless. - I'm never bored. I once spent three months in solitary, total darkness. I just look inside. There's a lot to see. - Hey, man, what about those chicks? - One of 'em's already dead. Maybe we ought to take the rest of 'em, bury in the old town cemetery. - Nah, man, let's drug 'em up and keep 'em here for a while and party with 'em! - Reaper, you can't let 'em go. They know too much. - Till tomorrow, I do the thinkin' around here. - Reaper, you wouldn't really kill them, would you? - Might even kill you. - But Reaper, I did everything you asked me to. You said you'd take care of me. - Aw, shut up, why don't you go back to Podunk or Peoria, or wherever the hell you came from? Wade? - I had a funny feelin' about you, man. - I'm clean. - Bullshit! You tryin' to rip me off, or are you a pig? - Does it make any difference? - I'm gonna enjoy this. - Cut him, Munch, cut him! (grunting) (thudding) - Come on, man, cut him! - Okay, now, everybody, just hold it right there, hold it right there. Stay where you are. (motorcycle rumbling) (energetic rock music) - Ever shoot before? - No! - You might have to, honey. (motorcycle revving in distance) - Oh, no, they're back. - All right, let's get out of here. (motorcycle rumbling) - [Wade] Girls! - Is this what you're lookin' for? Don't move. Where are your friends? - Hey, I'm not one of them. I'm a police officer working undercover. - Sure you are. - Look, you guys gotta believe me. Those guys are gonna be back here any second, then they'll kill us all. (motorcycles rumbling) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (groans) - Split up, back off, head for cover now! (suspenseful music) - I still can't see 'em. We're gonna have to get out of this place. I'm gonna hit as many as I can on the way. - Let's get out. - Reaper! - I want you to shut up and listen! Pack all the money and then go around and take the keys outta all the bikes and the thing. - But why? - All the keys, get me? - But why? - Wait at my bike. I'm gettin' outta here! - What about the gang? - Just do what I tell you to. - But they're your friends! - I don't have any friends. - What about me? - Yeah, sure, you're comin' with me, just do it fast! (tense music) (guns firing) - [Man] Munch, watch out! (gun fires) (groaning) (guns firing) (tense music) - Oh, my God! - [Wade] Steady now. (gun fires) (woman screams) - Linda, you're okay! (guns firing) (tense music) (motorcycle rumbling) - Skin! Come back here, you bitch! (gun firing) (gun firing) (grunts) - Shit, no keys! (guns firing) Hey, I'm gettin' outta here, Reaper! (gun fires) (gun clicking) (tense music) - Okay, buddy. You're under arrest. Let's get those hands in the air. You have the right... - Shut the fuck up. She's gettin' away with the money, let's get her! Half of it's yours. - And you lost it. Now you've got nothin' and you are nothin'. - I'll just start all over again. Nothin' is the perfect place to start. - Reaper, what kinda name is that? - You know, Wyman, like death. The Reaper, like Grim. - That so? You the Grim Reaper, boy? - Killed his cellmate two days before the poor son-of-a-bitch got his parole. - Sounds like a fuckin' animal to me. Heard the guy had a fortune hid on the outside. You hear about that, Reaper? - Hell, we could stop and pick it up for you, Reaper. (policemen laughing) Bet you had some little punk smoking your pipe, enjoying your company. (laughs) - County crew ahead. - Ah, shit. Probably workin' on the damn highway again. (muffled speaking over radio) - Hey, boys, what's up? - Had a quake out here last night. The fault line runs right under the highway up the road here. - Jesus! - Yeah, we got a six-inch crack right through the blacktop. What you have to do is take this side road here for about a mile and a half, you'll be all right. - Thanks. - Who you got back there? - [Policeman in Back Seat] The Grim Reaper. (laughs) - You know those county sons of bitches start at 27,000? - Ah, I wouldn't want their job. - Bullshit! All they do is fix shit. We get to catch and haul it around! (laughing) - He's talkin' about you, Reaper. (laughs) - Look at this. Jesus! (tense music) Shit, look at his leg. - Call it in. - This is transport unit 47 to base. (static crackling) Transport 47, come in, base. (tense music) I can't get through these hills. I think he's still alive, I'm gonna check it out. - I don't like this. Don't like it. Shit, get back in the car! Wyman! Shit! Get back in the car, you idiot! (gun firing) - Son of a bitch! - Thanks for reviving me (mumbles). (gun fires) (groaning) (grunting) (tense music) (gun fires) (static crackling) (tense music) - Desert's been dead without you, man. (tense music) (laughing) - (speaking in Spanish) Reaper. Now we're even. (tense music) - Let him die, man. Let him die slow. - Don't! - What do you think I am? Some kind of animal? (panting) (gun fires) (dramatic tense music) (motorcycle rumbling) - Excuse me. Hey. It's a crime scene. Hey, dickhead! You can't be here, there's a police line around the whole area. - I don't see one. - Well, it's what you call figurative. I'm waiting for the evidence team, you can't be here. You can't be here, understand? - Hey, relax, man, I'm a cop. - It doesn't matter if you are. You're not local and you can't be here. The hell you doing? - It's not blood, theatrical makeup. - Hey, who are you? How'd you find out about this? Where you going? - I got a date with the devil. (motorcycle rumbling) (mysterious music) ♫ Hey ♫ They'll make you sweat ♫ They'll make you cry ♫ They'll cut your spirit just before you die ♫ Don't know right, they don't know wrong ♫ Just ridin' hard with the devil's song ♫ They'll take your money, they'll break your pride ♫ Don't try to run, ain't no place to hide ♫ Another storm is comin' down ♫ Saddle up, we're headed southbound ♫ You don't wanna stare 'em straight in the eye ♫ You don't even wanna try to pass 'em on by ♫ A white lady has stolen all their senses ♫ Now it's time to die ♫ Said bad man ridin', ridin' with the wind ♫ Bringin' in the storm from Mexico ♫ Hey, I said bad man ridin', ridin' with the wind ♫ Bringin' in the storm from Mexico (motorcycles rumbling) (tense music) (tattoo machine buzzing) - That's the way it goes. (mumbles) - [Tattoo Artist] Sit still. - I was at my sister's wedding in Santa Barbara and I met this really cute chick. We hit it off. You know, and I was thinking... - Come on, seriously, sit still. - I was thinking, you know, there's a chick, man, that I could spend some time with. You know, if my old lady wouldn't mind it. This chick was beautiful, man, we hit it off. Next thing I know, she starts talking about givin' me head, and I said, "Hey, listen, "just climb on the old chorizo, huh?" You know, it could have been a really great relationship, somethin' I coulda really liked goin' for. (groaning) You're fuckin' me up, man! (yelling) Jesus, man! - Hey, Harlan. How you doin', Harlan? I'm gonna ask you a few questions, all right? Huh? - Man, all right! - Is it all right if I ask you a couple of questions? - Yes, man! - Where's Reaper at? - Reaper who? - You know, Reaper, Harlan, Reaper! - Okay, man, I saw him in San Quentin two weeks ago. - San Quentin, huh? (tattoo machine buzzing) - All right, all right! - Where's Reaper? (tattoo machine buzzing) (screaming) - Okay, man, I saw him just yesterday! Jesus! I saw him yesterday! - Where was he? Where? - Hey, man, do I look like a crystal ball or somethin'? (tattoo machine buzzing) (screaming) Fuck, man! - Where's Reaper? - [Harlan] He went back, he's in the desert somewhere. - Where in the desert, where in the desert? - Oh, man, you're fuckin' me up! - [Wade] Where in the desert? (groaning) - I think the first stop was gonna be (mumbles). I swear to God, I don't know anything else. I don't have a loyalty to that son of a bitch. I got a wife and kids too. I got a job, got a studio. - You're a special effects makeup artist, aren't ya? - Yeah, man, how did you know? - 'Cause you're dirty in this Reaper thing, man, and they're checking your prints at the station right now. (groaning) (tense music) - Motherfucker! (speaking in Spanish) - Hey, I'm riding back to town. - Why? - Come on, Reaper, this is bullshit. We've already ridden over 100 miles, you haven't told us where we're going. Hey, life isn't like this anymore. - What about loyalty? - Fuck loyalty! I got a job startin' tomorrow. I think I speak for us... - Hey! Speak for yourself, asshole! - Yeah! Leave me the fuck outta your shit too. - Yeah, no shit. - You know what's wrong with you, Munch? You're gutless. (groaning) (tense music) Like I said, gutless. (tense music) Tomorrow, we leave for the Hopi Mountains. - Hopis, what for? - The Hopis were spiritual visionaries. The Indian soil holds the key to our future. We ride at dawn. - Far out. - Hey, why don't you leave this to the force? They'll take care of it. - As long as Reaper's involved, it's my business. - Well, the best defense is a good offense. Try these, I made them for you. - [Wade] I already got shoes. - Not like these. Simply put your foot down, right heel, see? You've heard of steel-tipped shoes, haven't you? Here! Now, this is a very special gun. When the safety is on, it fires normally, but when the safety is off, it fires backwards, straight at whoever pulls the trigger. (chuckles) Here. These will come in handy, explosives. - How do they work? - Well, you need this to go along with it. There's a little button here. It accesses a detonator. It's good for 300 feet. - Hey, thanks, Rog. This stuff ought to do me a lot of good. Thanks a lot, buddy. (Rog chuckles) (tense music) - Times are changing, Reaper. You know, half the bikers are married, got kids. Ridin' free's a thing of the past, man. - Here, maybe. America is lost to three-piece suits, air surveillance at 55 miles an hour. - Where then? Seems like there's no place left. - Imagine a city of our own, a biker city, with me as king, and no laws except the laws of nature. - Yeah, none of them wannabe righteous pigs. - No helmets and all the drugs you want. (mumbling) - I can dig it. - Justice for bikers. - A city built on gold. (tense music) (screeching) ♫ Hey, it's comin' to you, summer storm ♫ We'll be on and it's far too long ♫ Heaven's laid on the line and such ♫ So now, honey, wanna love you much ♫ Come on, love ♫ Come on, love me, ooh - Give me a red beer. (music drowned out by chattering) ♫ Show me what you can do I'm lookin' for Reaper. (laughing) - Hey! This guy's lookin' for Reaper! (laughing) You ride with the Reaper? - Maybe I do. - (laughs) He ain't too popular around here. He burned us once too often. - Now, how could he do that? - Hey, you fuckin' with us, man? - Tell me where Reaper is! (thudding) (groaning) (punching) (glass shattering) (hissing) (man screaming) You tell Reaper I'm on my way. - No problem. (motorcycles rumbling) - Why don't you invite your friends out? Relax, we're all on the same side here. - What side's that? - The outside. - Grayden, that's the Reaper, man. - What's a Reaper? - He used to be bad news. - You know a biker named Cat Fish? He's somewhere between here and Hopi land. - We all know Cat Fish, man. He was through here about a week ago. (grunting) (thudding) - I told ya, I do the talkin' here! - This mean anything to you? - Nothin', what do you want from us? - I'm lookin' for a fortune, and Cat Fish can help me find it. Anyone want a cut? - We got everything we need here. We don't need you or your money. - Well, you've got high ideals, and a lot of balls. - Might makes right. Why don't you just ride the fuck outta here, Reaper? - That your final word? (tense music) (spits) (gun fires) (tense music) (gun clicks) So much for havin' balls. We can all die here right now, or you can ride with me and get rich. The man who finds Cat Fish first will be able to finance his own army. (tense music) I thought you'd see it my way. Let's ride. (motorcycles rumbling) (tense music) (mystical music) - Rain Maker! (mystical music) So, how'd you find me? - Your energy's strong. Easy to track. - What brings you out here? - Lookin' for work. My reputation isn't what it used to be. - [Wade] What's the matter, losing your touch? - The sky is different now. Yeah, it's full of pollution, even way out here. And little pieces of it are gone forever. You know, rain makin' is like fightin' chemical warfare these days. You know there's black sky all around you? - Yeah, I know. I'm gonna try and blow that sky away. - The Reaper, huh? When I first met you two years ago, you were pissed off, but your soul was clear. Now it's dark with fury. - You sound like a fortune cookie. - Just readin' your cards, son, that's all. - We got a lot of ridin' to do. (motorcycles rumbling) (soft pensive music) (chattering) ♫ Fallin' off the swing, slippin' on the slide ♫ Tryin' everything to find a better ride ♫ Then you count to 50 and you kick my can ♫ Playin' hide and seek until you find your man Hey, rising star. You don't happen to know a guy by the name of Reaper, do you? - Maybe. (energetic music) Check out Vito Pardito. (pensive music) - This can't be all of it. - What's the next move, Reaper? - I wanna find Cat Fish. Take two men and comb the hills. (pensive music) (motorcycles rumbling) (man groaning) (mumbling) - [Grayden] Help me, Reaper shot me. - Okay there, let me. - The pain, it hurts. Reaper shot me. - Quiet now, son. Now, breathe deeply with me, come on. (breathing deeply) Pain is goin' away. - Yes. - Where'd Reaper go? - South, Ciudad. (mumbles) Took a bunch of my skins, promised 'em big money. (coughing) (tense music) - [Rain Maker] You rest now. (mystical music) (upbeat rock music) - It's hot! Okay, come on now, girls, girls, girls, sex. Come on, Angie, give me a little sex. Nice, Brigette, great. Great. That's it, Angie, you're gettin' there. Sex, both of you. (mumbling) Great. (motorcycle rumbling) (hooting) - Look out, gonna have some fun today. (laughs) (hooting) Get a load of this. - Hey, come on, guys, we're trying to get a job done. (motorcyclist laughing) You know what work is, don't you? You've heard of the word, haven't you? Work. (laughing) - Those people are gonna need some help. - [Motorcyclist] Do we look like we work? - Why don't you assholes hit the road? Come on, we're trying to focus. (laughing) (tense music) - Focus on this. (gun fires) (women gasping) (laughing) Come on. (women gasping) - Get a load of this. - So, who wants to be first, huh? Who wants to grease (mumbles)? (laughs) How 'bout you, babe? Bet you'd be the sweetest thing I ever tasted, huh? (laughs) How 'bout a kiss? (slapping) I said kiss me, bitch. Kiss me, bitch! - Hey! (tense music) - Hey, why don't you back off, motherfucker, or the girls are history. - I brought you boys something. Happy Fourth of July! - Hey, cat, that's dynamite! Come on! - What are you doing, man? - Piece of cake. (motorcycle rumbling) Ah. Damn, I hate to waste a whole frigging road flare. (tense music) (motorcycle rumbling) - Oh, Reaper, am I glad to see you. Ran into some trouble. - What kinda trouble? - Some big blond asshole. - Olson. Was he alone? - He had that Rain Maker freak with him. - Did he follow you? - No, Reaper, I swear to God. Hey, come on, look, I swear to God. (grunting) - Pounder, take a couple of men, find Olson and the white hair and stop 'em, dead. - Yeah, you got it. (mumbles) (motorcycles rumbling) (suspenseful mystical music) (tense music) (gun firing) - (mumbles) Reaper knows we're coming! (guns firing) (tense music) (groaning) (grunting) Okay, son, I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Tell me the truth and you're outta here. You lie to me and you stay here forever, you got it? Where's Reaper? - He's south of the border. - Where? - Down in Mexico. (panting) - Where? - I don't know! - What's he doing down there? - I don't know, man. (panting) - Come on! - Dude, he's got 100 men with him. I don't know, that's all I know, he went south. That's all I know. - All right, man. Get outta here! - Hey, dickhead, you wouldn't find Reaper in 100 years! - Hey, why'd you let him go? - We're coming back for you and kick your fuckin' ass, and I'm with 'em! - Liar, liar, pants on fire. (beeping) (loud blasting) (groaning) (flames crackling) - He said Reaper is south? - We ride north. (motorcycles rumbling) (chattering) - Here's Cat Fish, boss. - Find it? Well, I'll be a son of a bitch, Skin. - Reaper, look, don't be pissed off, okay? The money I took, I invested it. I screwed up, you know? - Who cares? It was only 30 grand. After tomorrow, that'll be small change. I thought you were goin' straight. What are you doin' ridin' with a piece of shit like this? - He's a nice guy. - I wasn't talkin' to you. (motorcyclists laughing) Search him, Tester. Strip search this one. - [Tester] I was hoping you'd say that. - What do you want, Reaper? - I'm your new business partner. (motorcycles rumbling) (whip cracking loudly) (gasping) I know you're lying to me, Cat Fish. - You don't know shit. - I know more than you think. I was Hangman's cellmate. I know you were gonna meet him here two days after his parole. (whip cracking loudly) That's today, asshole. (whip cracking loudly) I know you have the other part of the map. (whip cracking loudly) I know you think I won't really kill you. (whip cracking loudly) - Fuck off! (laughing) (whip cracking loudly) (panting) (whip cracking loudly) - Reaper, stop! (whip cracking loudly) Stop! (whip cracking loudly) I'll give you the map, stop! - Skin, don't! - Promise me you won't hurt him. - No! - [Skin] Okay? - Of course. (grunting) - Cat Fish, look at me. Are you okay? - Get away from me! - Cat Fish, I just saved your life. - You sold me out! (grunting) - What do you want to do with the bitch? - Reaper, Reaper, you said you wouldn't hurt him! - And I won't. - Bastard! Son of a bitch! Let me down, let me down! - Shut her up. - Let me down, you piece of shit! (slapping loudly) - Come on, Cat Fish, I'll buy you a drink. - We better split up tomorrow. We're near an old abandoned Navajo reservation. Reaper could be anywhere around here. - Wade, I meant what I said before about the blackness in your heart. You know, the more hate you give, the more you have to get. - That sounds like a warning. - Listen, the more hatred you direct at Reaper, the more hatred will come into your life. (tense music) (chattering) - Reaper, they never came back, Pounder and them. - Mm. That's all right. Least they'll slow 'em down. (tense music) (pensive music) - Hmm. What's your secret? - You still hangin' around? Cat Fish, I'm givin' you a choice. Ride with me and take a share like everybody else, or I'll let you and the bitch go. - Count me in. - Cat Fish, Cat Fish, you prick! Fuck you, Reaper. - Tried it, Skin. It wasn't worth the effort. - Bastard, son of a bitch! Cat Fish, come back here! - Don't worry, somebody'll come and keep you company, coyote, mountain lion, maybe. - You just gonna leave her here, Reaper? She knows an awful lot about what we're doin'. - She's bait. (motorcycles rumbling) - Bastard! - You take the hills. - This could be dangerous. - Yeah, so is crossing the street. (motorcycles rumbling) (pensive music) - We're looking for a cave. Two shares to the man who finds it first. (motorcycles rumbling) (motorcycles rumbling in distance) - Professor, it looks like somebody's coming. (motorcycles rumbling) - Visitors from the real world. Maybe they know who won the World Series. (motorcycle rumbling) (tense music) (panting) - Wade. (gun fires) Wade! (Skin groans) Wade! (panting) Bastards! - (laughs) You got him smack in the middle of the head, man. - Nah, just grazed him. - [Man Wearing Vest] Hey, where'd that old guy go? - Fuck him! This is the one Reaper wants. - All right. (tense music) (motorcycles rumbling) - Where's your dog now, asshole? (tense music) (motorcycles rumbling) - What's wrong with you, badass? Thirsty? (laughing) - Come on, let's get outta here. (motorcycle rumbling) (tense rock music) Oh, hey, man, hey, I'm sorry. Look, once you get up, we'll go a little bit slower. (laughing) Ready? Let's go. (motorcycle rumbling) (yelling) (laughing) Come on, pretty boy, here we go! (laughing) (tense rock music) Hold on. Havin' fun? Havin' fun back there? (laughing) (mumbling) - Looks like you could use some help. - [Skin] Who are you? - Folks call me the Rain Maker. - [Skin] You're the Rain Maker? - [Rain Maker] Mm-hmm. - I've heard of you. Are you with Reaper? - I made that mistake once. Now I'm lookin' for him and a man named Wade. - Wade Olson? He was here, they shot him. - What? - Well, they just grazed him and he's okay, but they take him away to meet Reaper. (motorcycles rumbling) - Which way now, man? - [Man With Mustache] He said between the two tallest peaks. - [Man Wearing Vest] Guess that'd be those two up there on the left. - I guess so. They all look the same to me. Let's get the hell outta here. (motorcycles rumbling) What the fuck? What the fuck is goin' on? - Geez, he's got it wrapped around a rock. - What? Yeah, I'm gonna kick his fuckin' ass. You stupid, what are you? (thudding) (groaning) - Son of a bitch! You're dead, asshole! You are one dead asshole. I'm draggin' back a corpse. (gun fires) - Good timin', Rain Maker. What'd you bring her along for? Reaper could be anywhere. - Nice to see you again too, Wade. - I am glad to see you. It's dangerous, that's all. - [Rain Maker] Looks like they drug you halfway across the desert. - [Skin] Are you all right, Wade? I was really worried about you. - [Wade] Yeah, I'm fine, I enjoy being (mumbles). - [Rain Maker] Hey, Wade, what's the plan? - Reaper's not far from here, I think we can reach... - [Man With Mustache] Hold it right there. - Hey, come on, man. Just be cool and put that thing down. - Hey, just stay back, asshole, okay? - Come on, just show us some mercy and we'll show you some. - Mercy? What do I look like to you, Florence fuckin' Nightingale? - Hey, man, don't say I didn't give you a chance. - Yeah. (gun fires) - I gave him a chance. - Who do I ride with? - Why don't you take a Greyhound back to Nebraska? - Very funny, you're not gonna leave me here. - Skin, this could be dangerous. - What do you care what happens to me? - Look, you're a nice kid, that's all. - Kid, Wade, have you looked at me lately? - Hey, just go ahead and do whatever you want, all right? - I will. (motorcycle rumbling) (tense music) (grunting) (woman screaming) - That's enough! Who are you? - Leonard Bowen, professor at UNM. - Professor of what? - History. - What are you doing out here? - It's a field trip. Navajo Nation is... - Have you found a cave? - Cave? - A cave! Look at this! Have you seen this cave? - No, there are no caves up here! (grunts) - Reaper, let us have the bitches, man. - When we're finished! - Come on, that's bullshit! There's no caves. We followed you halfway across the desert. There's no caves, there's no gold. Let us have the bitches. (gun fires) (groans) - I said when we're finished. - If my guess is right, this is it. - What do you mean? - Give me your map. I don't think it's a cave, I think it's a marker. - [Reaper] Meaning what? - Meaning your map leads you here to match those black shapes. From here, you have to read both maps together. - Yeah, so go ahead. - Well, there's a lightning bolt on both maps in the corners, unrelated to anything else. Your map has 15 marks. Just marks, nothing else. - I thought the gold would be buried 15 feet deep. - The gold? My God, you don't think Quantrill's Raiders brought the gold here? - Don't care who the fuck brought it here. I'm the one that's takin' it away. (pensive music) - Maybe the marks on your map means miles and the squiggly line on the wall indicates a river. The teepees are 15 miles down river, an Indian camp or something. - So what's the lightning? - We find out when we get there. - Get where? There isn't a river within 100 miles of here. - Not anymore. (pensive music) - [Man Wearing Bandana] So what are we gonna do? - Keep the girls here a couple hours in case this doesn't work out. I don't want you touchin' 'em. - Then what? - Catch up to us! - And what do we do about them? - Whatever you want. Move out! (motorcycles rumbling) (women gasping) (tense music) - All right, ladies, naptime's over. - [Woman] No, no, don't hurt us! (women screaming) (tense music) - You can't do this, you heard what Reaper said. - Mr. Reaper was called away on business. I'll be operating in his stead. - You saw what he did to the other guy. He'll do the same to you! - Reaper's not here anymore, dickhead! (women gasping) Who wants to go first? You, mama! I want that bike polished. Come on, do it, now! - I have nothing to use. - Use them rags you got on! Do it! (gun fires) All of it! All of it, baby, all of it! - I won't. Do what you want. - Why don't you do as you're told? (woman crying) - Come on, ladies. We got bikes enough for all y'all! Come on! Get to work now! (gun fires) (man laughing) Let's go. Fellas, we're gonna go on a date tonight to the movies, hey, Jefferson? Come on! - [Jefferson] Yeah, now polish! - I don't wanna see any more dust on it, come on! Move it, move it! Harder! Harder! (tense music) Do it! Yeah, look at these ladies. Mr. Jefferson, are you happy? - Yeah, they polish good. - Your motorcycle's lookin' mighty fine today, yeah! Yeah! Come on, ladies, you havin' fun now? Come on, honey. Let's go. (woman groaning) Do it. (fabric ripping) Come on, do it! Come on. Come on, Jefferson wants his bike clean! Now, do it! Come on, bitch, I don't see you movin' anymore! Let's go! Don't miss no spot. You heard what the man said. (mumbles) I don't know if I can control myself with all this jigglin' around here. I think I'm gonna get ready to break Reaper's rule. (crying) - Yeah, and I'll start right now. - No! (gun fires) - Take cover! (guns firing) (tense music) - Take this. - Okay. - Oh, Wade, hold on tight. Hey, Wade! God dang! - Surprise, asshole! I'm really gonna enjoy this. (gun fires) (Skin laughs) (laughing) - [Skin] All right! (howling) - Yeah! (mystical music) (motorcycles rumbling) (pensive music) - Sweet Jesus. - Skin, I want you to ride back to L.A. with the girls. - You can't tell me what to do. - I'm not tellin' you, I'm askin' you. The scene could be dangerous. - Really? - Look, just ride back to L.A. with the girls. I'll look you up when the scene's over. - Sure you will. You'll find the gold and I'll be just another bimbo memory. - I'm not after the gold. (motorcycle rumbling) (clattering) (eerie pensive music) - Look at that. Reaper, I found it! - Start digging where the lightning bolt points. It won't be too deep. When they buried it, they didn't have much time. Neither do I. (pensive music) (bluesy Western music) - I'll handle this, you go after Reaper. - All right. (gun fires) (bluesy Western music) (guns firing) (smacking) (groaning) (mystical music) (bluesy Western music) (tense music) (motorcycle rumbling in distance) - Come to papa, sucka! (chuckling) (tense music) (guns firing) (energetic rock music) What the hell is this? (motorcycle rumbling) What the hell is this darn thing anyhow? (beeping) (loud blasting) (tense music) - Hey, asshole. Drop the gun. I said drop the gun. - Aw, come on, kid, you wouldn't shoot an old man, would you? - Yeah, yeah, I think I would. - Without a fair fight? - You think you're a real cowboy, don't you, Grandpa? - Could be. (bluesy Western music) - Well, then let's draw. (tense music) (gun fires) (groans) (mystical music) (slow Western music) - Get it out, dig it out! (laughing) (pensive music) It's here! It's gold! (laughs) Gold, gold! - Yeah. This is it. (laughing) After all this time, after all this time. (pensive music) (gun fires) Reaper, I thought we had a deal. - Partnerships dissolve. (gun fires) (tense music) We never coulda trusted him. Now we won't have to. - [Man With Beard] Tester, we're takin' the gold down. Guard the road. (tense music) - Get away from my gold. - It's my gold too, come all this way with you. - I'm not sharin' this with anybody, especially some two-bit grease monkey. - What about loyalty, man? - (laughs) Fuck loyalty. (gun fires) (groaning) (gun firing) (tense music) (grunting) (tense rock music) (thudding) (groaning) (ominous music) (groaning) (tense music) (panting) - They won't help you this time, Reaper. The ones I didn't kill, you did. - We'll go 50-50. I have a lotta gold here, Olson. - Gold ain't worth much where you're headed, Reaper. - God, you got a small mind, Olson. Go ahead then, take me back to prison. - Not this time! (wood boards snapping) (wood creaking) (tense music) (wood boards snapping) (grunting) (wood boards creaking and snapping) (grunting) (echoing scream) (pulley rattling) (wood creaking) (loud crashing) (tense music) - Where you goin' now? - Oh, I don't know, maybe Mexico for a while. How 'bout you? - Nah, I'm off to Hawaii. (motorcycle rumbling) - I wanna thank you for riding shotgun with me on this. - My pleasure. You know, Hawaii this time of year is worth a visit. Yeah, there's a old, old, man there, sort of a rain makin' kahuna. (mumbles) Why don't you come with me? - Nah, think I need some time alone. - God be with you, son. (motorcycle rumbling) (pensive rock music) (motorcycle rumbling) (upbeat rock music)
