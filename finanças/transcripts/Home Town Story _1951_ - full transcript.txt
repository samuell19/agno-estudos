United Flight 193 from Chicago, now arriving. Passengers for Capitol City will embark immediately. Say, isn't that Blake Washburn? - Yes. - The battling senator, back home to stay. - Hello there Blake. - Hello Bob. The defeated senator come home to lick his wounds. Lay off him. What do you say we bury the hatchet Blake, now that the election is over? The voters didn't seem to fall for that motto of yours, did they? The people's choice. This election is all about reprimanding. There's another one in two years. - Blake, is that you? - Hello Leo. Got your cab here? Sure, right here. What happened? I just said hello to a campaign manager. Happy Birthday Blake. You had a birthday last week fella. Happy Birthday! Oh yeah thanks. How did you remember that Leo? I haven't forgotten a thing since I took that memory course three years ago. Why'd you have to take a memory course? When I was in High School I just couldn't remember a thing. So I figured if I was to get anywhere, I'd have to remember things. Now when people want a cab, the first one they call on is me. Cause they remember that I remember things like their birthdays or favorite color. - McFarland factory just got a new paint job. - So I see. John McFarland is really dressing it up. It looks real good. Probably celebrating his son's being elected State Senator. Blake I wouldn't worry about not being re-elected if I were you. Politics is a funny thing. Sometimes the voters like you and sometimes they don't. I thought they tore down all those posters. Why did you give him that clip on the chin for? Just to let him know how I feel about his campaign tactics. - Campaign tactics? - Sure. The people were hood-winked into voting for Bob McFarland. I don't know. I don't think I was hood-winked. What do you mean? I voted for him. Mother. Mother, do we have some red thread and a long crooked needle? Katie, take off your skates in the house dear. I just saw something over at Judy's house and now I know what I'm going to make Blake for a present. A present for Blake? That's nice. - you know that red, crooked braid I have in my sewing basket? - Yes. Well, I'm going to make a dressy star for Blake. That's why I need a crooked needle. Well, it might be a little advanced for you, but I'm sure your brother will like it. Run up and get your sewing basket and I'll show you how. - I'm sure you can sew it without a crooked needle. - Think so mother? Besides you'll have plenty of time. Blake won't be home until next week. Don't be too sure mother. Blake! Oh Blake you scamp. Why won't you tell your mother when you are coming home. You know surprises always surprise me. Blaaaaaaaaaaake. Katie, how are you? Blake, you shouldn't have come home. I haven't finished your present yet. Well, I have one for you. Oh Blake! A puppy! And such a beautiful one. The flowers are lovely Blake. What's this? It's a corsage, we are going dancing tonight. I'll keep it fresh for you. I'll put it in the refrigerator. - What's his name? -He has no name. You'll have to name him. Well hello Blake. Are you back in town to stay? Hello Jimmy. Yes, I'm back to stay. Well that's politics. Let's sit down, shall we Blake? - You want to Janice? - Yes, let's. - Hello Blake. How are you? - Hello Gloria. - Suppose we have dinner? - Okay. Hey, your hair looks different. What have you done? That's a new dress, isn't it? Janice, you look wonderful. It's about time you noticed me. You've been so busy saying hello to all your old friends, that you haven't had a minute for me. - A fine bunch of friends. - You're imagining things. They're all glad to see you. They're glad to see me defeated, but there'll be another election. Mr. Haskins wants to see you personally. Now Dudley, I want four porkchops, browned slightly over the fire. And put them in the oven for 15 minutes. Then take them back out and dust them lightly with sugar, pepper, and garlic salt. Then back on to the fire for five minutes. Did you get that? - And a cherry pie a' la mode for dessert. - No salad? - Of course, but let me fix my own dressing. - Right Mr. Haskins. Blake! - Blake! Hello., - Hello Slim. Blake you snake. Why don't you tell a guy when you get back into town? - How are you Janice? - Fine Slim. What are you trying to do? Keep your homecoming a secret? - Now don't you start too. - Start? Start what? Oh nothing. Good to see you boy. When are you coming back to work? I'll be down Monday morning. Your uncle Cliff hasn't done a lick of work since he knew you were coming back. He's waited a long time for his trip out west. Every summer I worked for the Herald, Uncle Cliff threatened to skip out and leave me with the paper. You know it's going to be like our college daily. Blake was the editor and I was the freshman reporter. We used to call him boss. - How's the school? - Fine, still in the third grade. Really? - Welcome home Senator. Hello Todd, Betty. Stay where you are Senator. No need to go into one of your long- winded speeches. Now look here Todd. -You two seem to be in a gay mood this evening. Why not, we're celebrating. Slim how about a news item on us? We've been married 7 years today. - Seven years Betty? - Sure Janice. Don't you remember? We got engaged the same week you and Blake did. Come over and see us. Marriage is a wonderful thing. -Let's go Blake. - Why, these people don't bother me. - Well, they do me. - Well, all right. -You're not really going? - Excuse me Slim, but I'll see you Monday at the office. Sorry, we're not eating. - But you are eating sir? - I most certainly am. I didn't realize it's been seven years. Yes it has. Five years in the army and two years at the State capitol. I guess that's a pretty long time for a girl to wait for a fella. Yes. Why don't you drive my car home, I don't need it tomorrow, it's Sunday. No thanks. I don't mind walking. Well I think we'd better plan on getting married right away. I'm not sure I want to marry you Blake. But Janice, what do you... Why? I think perhaps it's because I don't like being taken for granted. You expect me to wait patiently for you and to marry you when you are ready. But you know what I've been trying to accomplish before we got married. Things haven't worked out for us before. Yes, I know. I expected to be re-elected. And we could have married and settled down in capitol city. I worked hard as Senator. Because I had to step on some toes, they kicked me out. The voters don't seem to realize that they kicked out the man who has their best interests at heart. Getting into a fist fight on the Senate floor isn't the way to get things done. But all the things I was working on out there, I can still do. Don't you see? Just because I wasn't re-elected isn't going to stop me. think I know what the people want and I can fight for them just as well being editor of the Herald. Blake there isn't a person in the world that knows better than I do how sincere you are. And I know that you are going to do great things with the paper. Will you have faith in me and let me do things my way? Will you trust me? Of course I'll trust you. Blake I know I haven't mentioned it in the last five minutes, but... I love you. Blake! Your breakfast. Finish your milk Katie, if you want all your teeth to grow. Rags! Rags is hungry. He wants his milk too. Don't put a dog on the table. He's not a dog mother. He's only a puppy. - Blake, I'm going to call him Rags. - Good, you like him Katie? Good, you like him Katie? Well he's your pet Katie, so it's up to you to take care of him. See that you feed him before you go off to school. All right mother, I will. - There's the school bus. - There's the school bus. I'll feed him tomorrow. You'll feed him now won't you Blake? Shall I say hello to my future sister- in-law? - What? Say what? - Janice, she's my teacher. Yes, say hello. Hey, come back here. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye Blake. -Good-bye Katie. - Good-bye mother. - Good-bye dear. Bye Rags. - Good-morning. -Godmorgen Katie. Drink your coffee Blake so you'll wake up. Well when your wife complains about you reading the paper at the table... ...you'll have a pretty good excuse. What's that mother? As editor of the paper, it is part of your job to see what the morning edition looks like. Did you see Janice last night? Mother, if any of your inquiring neighbors ask you, just say that Janice and I are going to be married almost immediately. Blake... I'm so happy for you. I almost feel like crying. Oh no mother. I'll save it for the wedding. We have just as many factories in this part of the country. We do. Mother, do you know if the McFarland plant dumps any refuse into the White River? Oh Blake, I haven't the faintest idea. It would be interesting to find out. Very interesting. Good-morning. Good-morning Iris. Good-morning Mr. Haskins. The order supply has called twice. They want someone to pick up the cuts for Thursday and I told them you would do it Mr. Haskins. I'm a reporter, not an errand boy. What's the matter with Erwin? He went down to see about the monthly sales Mr. Haskins. Okay, I'll do it. How long do you have to work around here before you stop calling me "Mr. Haskins"? I always treat men with respect, then they treat me with respect Mr. Haskins. Is that a proven theory, or something you're just trying out? Mr. Blake Washburn is looking for you. He asked for you two hours ago. What's he doing here this early? Doesn't he know that we don't wake up til afternoon around here? He was here at 9 o'clock. - Are you still keeping company with that Herbert guy? - Yes I am, Mr. Haskins. Just asking. - Morning Slim. - Hi Bernie. Blake's been asking for you. Thanks for calling. - Morning Phobie. - Morning Slim. Have they been in there long? The old boy just got here. They been saying their good-byes. I'll wait til they get through then. So where's that recipe you promised me for my "cookery-corner"? I'll write that out for you. Do I get a "by-line"? On my "women's" page, not a chance. Don't worry Uncle Cliff, I'll answer those letters right away. Blake, I'm not going to give you a lecture on running a newspaper. I can't put more than four words together that makes sense. You always manage to make yourself understood. You mean writing editorials, well that I can do. But making speeches always did scare the daylights out of me so, don't expect me to make a speech. I won't. Just one thing. 215. There's always a lot of joking about all I know, I read in the papers. But Blake, that's no joke. People really believe what they read. I know. And in this country, the people expect to read the truth. See that they get it son. I will Uncle Cliff. - And thanks for everything. - No, no. Thank you for this trip I'm able to take now. I'll try not to send postcards. Thanks. Thanks alot. Good-bye Kim. - Now Cliff, don't stay away too long. -Don't worry. - Good-bye Phobie. -Good-bye Mr. Washburn. - Good-bye Bernie. - Good-bye Mr. Washburn, have a good trip. -Good-bye Slim. Good-bye Slim. And thank all of you for this wonderful present. - Good-bye Hoagie. - Good-bye Cliff and have fun. - I hope so. - Good Luck. - Morning boss. - Hello Slim. - I've got something to go to work on. - Yeah? I'm going to crack down on the McFarland factory. - You are? - Yeah, the pollution of the river water. - Now wait a minute Blake. -Now just let me do this my way, will you? You know any of the boys out there? Sure, I know Andy Butterworth. He's foreman of the chemical plant. He's our man. We'll drive out this afternoon and get the facts from him. Is this something you cooked up with Uncle Cliff? No, I didn't mention it to him. Ask Iris to come in, will you? Iris, the boss wants you. What got you started on stream pollution? It's a problem all over the country. Factories dump their wastes and acids into fresh water. It's something that should be controlled. There he is. Andy! - Hello Andy. - Well, how are you Slim? Andy, I would like you to meet Mr. Blake Washburn. Blake this is Andy Butterworth. - Hello Andy. - How do you do? -Oh, you're the new editor. - That's right. How are the kids? Fine, fine. I got another one since I saw you last. I got five now. Well those grey hairs are deceiving. Andy, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Do you mind? No, go ahead. It's off the record and we won't quote you. How much refuse and acid does the plant dump into the river? Why none. The factory is right on the river. You must dump some. No. The solvents are burned in the incinerator and the acids are deluted and hauled down to the sewage treatment plant. - What goes in the river? - Nothing. I know because it's my job to see that the disposal rules are carried out. Isn't there anything thrown in the river. Not a thing. Is that what you wanted to know? Yes, that's what I wanted to know. Thanks very much Andy. - Give my best to Virgina. - Yeah, sure thing. - Well, good-bye. - Take it easy. We'd better get back. We got a paper to get out. - What was the idea? - I made a mistake, no harm done. You feel you must have a crusade? Our readers should be informed about the things business industries get away with. - You mean John McFarland? - How do you suppose his son got elected? Why I have an idea the voters had something to do with it. They'll soon discover their mistake because I'm going to tell them with our little one-horse paper. Uncle Cliff wouldn't like to hear you call it that. The Herald hasn't grown up with the town. The crusade will help circulation. Don't you think we ought to be a bigger newspaper? Sure, I'm all for that. Then maybe I'd get a raise. But, let's not go of f half-cocked, what do you say boss? Drink your milk Rags if you want all your teeth. Katie, now keep your coat buttoned. Blake, when I get the list of all the pupils in my class, be sure you print the names of everyone. What? Didn't Slim tell you? I told him that my class was going on an outing. He said he would write it up if I gave him the names of all the pupils. - There's the schoolbus. - There's the schoolbus. And please see that the names are spelled right Blake. All right, Blake will tell his printer. - Bye Blake. - Bye Katie. - Good-bye mother. -Good-bye dear. Good-bye Rags. I'm going to take Rags on our field trip. What was that all about? Well Janice is taking her whole third grade for an outing next week. To look at the ground. The ground? You know, rocks, sand, and blossoms. The things they make us all study when we're 8 years old. You won't find any blossoms this time of year. Well, I think it's to show where the blossoms were last year and where they're going to be next year. Anyway, there'll be rocks. How about the Herald running an article on it. That should increase the circulation. Well there will be 25 children's names and all their relatives will want papers to see their names in print. Your Uncle Cliff always said to your dear father, names make news. Takes more than that to make a newspaper grow. What we need is a crusade about something that's important. Something big. - Yeah, I heard about it on the radio this morning. - That's an awful lot of money for one company to make. Yeah, I wish I had some of it. That's what caused your high-cost of living. Some people sure have it easy, making all that dough. Who gets all those profits? That's what I'd like to know. I wish somebody would tell me. I work for one of those big outfits. It's more money than any of us will ever see. - Good-morning Mr. Washburn. - Good-morning. Bernie, when did the item about Metro Manufacturing come in? This morning Blake, first thing. I just put it in the window. The teletype is in your office. Thanks. Bernie, ask AP for a complete text on the Metro Manufacturing item. - Okay Blake. - Oh Ken, save me the eighth column head. Still hammering away at the same subject? Yes. I suppose you know what you're doing? Of course I do. I'm printing a newspaper and giving the people what they want to read. Slim, see what you can find out about the companies in this state. Get the information on as many as you can. You're going to start on them are you? Yes, I am. Did you know circulation is up 500 copies? Yeah, I know. Well, I don't know what the rest of you are going to do, but I am going to a tea. This young editor has the right idea. He used to be State Senator, didn't he? That's right. Too bad he wasn't re-elected. He could do a lot of good up there. I think I'll write him a letter and tell him he ought to run again. - These are the personal letters Mr. Washburn. - Thank you Iris. Getting a lot of letters lately from your readers, aren't you boss? Yes. I was out bowling with a few of the fellows last night. They were discussing this attack you're making on business profits. It was very interesting to hear their opinions. And? They asked me a couple of question as to why you are doing it. But I couldn't answer them. I really don't know. Blake, Blake am I too late for the deadline? Hold on Katie. Deadline? This has to be in tomorrow morning's paper. It's important. Hello Slim. Hi Katie. Our class goes out on the outing tomorrow and this has to be printed before we go. Or it won't be news. It's the names of all the pupils. All these names? You must print everyone. It's important. Is it? I promised them their names would be in the Herald and they've got to be. I gave them my word. Well did you? I collected 10 cents for each name. Katie! - I'm going to give it to the Red Cross. - Okay, it'll be in tomorrow morning. Thanks Blake. You're a nice brother. I have to go now. Bye Slim. - Bye Katie. - Bye. - Good-bye Iris. - Good-bye Katie. How about it Blake? The town has a lot of confidence in you, but would like to see you take it a little easy. So would I. Concentrate on local news. Stop going off in all directions. Here's some local news. Why don't you write that article? Okay boss. Mr. Kenlack. I've got a news item about the third grade in Lincoln Grammar School. Do you think you'll have room for it? - Good-evening Slim. You still here? - I'm the babysitter. We just went to press. Blake, it's one o'clock. - Oh Janice, is it? - You were going to meet me at Kay's Diner at 11:30. Oh Janice, I'm sorry. - Forgive me? - Of course you're forgiven. How about some coffee? It's got to be ready by now. Piping hot. This one's with the sugar. Blake, tell me honestly. Are you just using this paper to get yourself back in the State Senate? Yes, I am. That's why you've been doing all this crusading. To get to the people who may vote for you one day. What's wrong with trying to get votes? You said you were going to do some good with the paper. You asked me to have faith in you while you did it. I didn't know you were going to trick your readers into voting you back into the Senate. Trick them? But I've been sincere about everything I've printed in the Herald. And because I have been, the people want me back in Capitol City. You're not being very honest with yourself. You really want to show them that you can come back after your defeat, don't you? The people are with me. Don't you realize you were a victim of a mistake in the first place? You came home our most decorated war hero and on that popularity you were elected State Senator. You were the victim of a mistake. Why do you say that? I heard the voters. I heard them talking before the last election. They realized their mistake and that's why they went to the polls and deliberately voted you out. I don't believe that. It's about time you did. You're a trained newspaper man and can be a good one. So stop trying to be a politician, something you're not suited for. But I've been doing all this for us. Don't you want to marry a guy that will amount to something. I want to marry the boy I used to know, not this fellow you're being now. What he's doing isn't the sort of thing I want to be part of. I'm going home Blake. Good-night Slim. Good-night Janice. I think this paper's gone overboard. Taking cracks at our company. What do you mean "our" company? Why don't you do something for that sour stomache of yours. - They treat us all right, don't they? - Oh pipe down. Stop at the foot of the hill and I'll put that sign back. Why bother? Nobody coming up here to Copper Hill. Get in the bus now. Go very quietly. Get in the back. - Where are we going? - Up to Copper Hill. - Hello Slim. - Hi Sam. - Good-morning Slim. - Good-morning. Iris, when are you going to get rid of that truck-driving boyfriend of yours? He's not a truck driver. He owns four delivery trucks and he doesn't drive them, he's the boss. I'm not going to get rid of him, I'm going to marry him. Congratulate him for me. Excuse me, I have to take the letters to Mr. Washburn. I'll do it for you. Good-morning. More letters from your constituents Senator. Slim lay off the cracks. They're getting a little tiresome. Aren't you a little touchy this morning? You're so eager to critize newspapers, why do you work for one? I wasn't critizing newspapers. They stand or fall on their own merit. It's you. I'm just going after facts and printing them. Like the time you went after some facts about the McFarland factory? I didn't find out anything. We found out the factory is not polluting the river. That was commendable. You didn't print that. I'd like to speak with you Mr. Washburn. But if you two are busy, I can come back later. - Mr. McFarland. - John McFarland. May I come in? - Why yes. - Thank-you. I thought I would come down and have a little talk about something we are both interested in. What's that? The subject of your editorials. How's your tobacco holding out? Fine sir. Here, you're welcome to it. - You're Slim Haskins, aren't you? - That's right. We have a draftsman at our shop. He talks a great deal about you. Deckerman. Yeah, we were in the same outfit. I suppose you've come to talk about your son, the Senator. No I didn't. I'm not too concerned about him. He'll take care of himself. But I've been following your editorials very closely. Now I know it's the duty of a newspaper to print the news. And companies like Tri-State, Metro and McFarland are news. Of course they are. Especially their profit. That's right. And I'm interested in profits. Both for myself and the customer. My main reason for coming here was to see, if perhaps, I could interest you in... ...printing something about a theory I have. I call it "Profites to the Customers". What do you mean? Well as I say, it's my own private little pet theory. Very simple not very complicated. You see I'm not an economist, I'm just a businessman. I have to make a profit to stay in business. Sure, we all know that. I make a profit on every electric motor I sell, but the customers must make a larger profit. Because if he doesn't, he won't buy my motors and I'm out of business. -The customer must make a profit? - That's right. - Would you like to try my mixture? - Why thank-you sir. Yes, the customer must make a profit. For example, you have some type-setting machines out there. The manufacturer that sold them, make a profit on them. But your paper would have never bought them in the first place if they couldn't deliver something beyond their original cost. They must continue to work for your paper to be worth more to you than you paid for them. As a customer, that's your profit. - My profit? - Yes, you sell your newspaper to a man for 5 cents. He gets news, advertisements and all kinds of information for his home and business. He gets service beyond the value of his 5 cents. As a customer, that's his profit. It's the same story with everything else. The light bulb, the refrigerator, the telephone. For this we pay a few dollars a month. Our profits are enormous in steps alone. In case of an emergency, it's value can't be estimated. It's a different slant than what we've been printing. As you say, that's just a theory. But you can't deny that you are a big business. In your editorials you've been insisting that because a thing is big, it's bad It takes bigness to do big things. Our industries have turned out equipment for our own forces in a remarkably short space of time. It was a big job and it was well done. It helped us to win the war and preserve our country. That's what America industry with its bigness was able to accomplish. Was that bad Blake? For the last 50 years, we've come a long way. It used to take a week to get a letter across the United States. Now we do it in one day. The difference in time alone could affect the happiness of the family. Why it might even be a matter of life and death. In my time I've seen advances in industry that have added 20 years to the average span of life. My father died in the old country at the age of 40. An old man. His work was absolute drudgery, slavery. On his own farm, from 5 o'clock in the morning til 8 o'clock at night. But because I live in America, I feel like a young man and I'll be 65 in April. Mr. McFarland, your tobacco makes mighty fine smoking. Why are you telling me all this? Well, I thought you might be interested in both sides of this profit question. Print something else for a change. Mr. McFarland, I don't tell you how to run your plant. So please don't tell me how to run my paper. I'll print my own conception of business profits. Good-day sir. Well I... ...just thought I'd come in and talk. Which I have. Remember Blake, when this country was first discovered, there was nothing here. Now look around. Everything you see is profits. Our transportation, communication, household appliances, medical equipment... Notice them sometime Blake. They're the real profits. Look up there! Raaaags, oh where is he? Rags! Come out of there. Look it's a mine. Maybe it's a gold mine. Rags, come out of there. It's dark. Allan, do you suppose Rags smells gold? Some dogs are awfully smart. Rags, come out of there. Rags is too little to be prospecting for gold. Katie...Allan... Rags! Oh there you are Rags. Come here you bad, bad boy. I bet he won't come. KATIE LOOK OUT! Katie come on, let's get out. Katie come on. Miss Janice. Katie's in there. Okay, I'll bring them out to you. - Here. - What's this? I'm quiting, that makes it official. - Oh listen Slim, just cause we took a couple of pokes at each other. - That isn't it. I just can't stay here and watch my best friend make a fool of himself. Look here! You're being the fool. Hello. Katie? Where, where are you? - Copper Hill. Please, please hurry. - All right Janice, I'll be right there. Slim, drive me out to Copper Hill. Something's happened to Katie. - What? - She didn't say. - Blake! - What happened? Katie went into the old mine. A bulldozer can handle this. The new highway through the pass. There's a bulldozer there. 103 into control one. Request bulldozer come to Copper Hill. Code 3. Control one to 103, Roger. Control one to 108M, contact bulldozer working in pass at south end of town. Need a doctor right away. Suggest the nearest one is Dr. Johnston at McFarland factory. We'll contact Dr. Johnston immediately. Blake's little sister is under the cave- in. Is there anything you want? You need any men from the factory? Thanks very much Mr. McFarland. The police have already sent for some equipment. - Doctor will you standby please. - Yes, of course. - There's Dr. Johnson, what are they... - Doctor, what are they doing? It's a matter of clearing away the front of the opening and we'll get to her. - Please stay here. - Doctor, do you think? You'd better turn it around and back in. We going to try and open it up. Come on in. Katie! My Katie! She's alive Mrs. Washburn, but I must make a thorough examination right away. Get her into the ambulance please. Careful. Tell Dr. Lee that the operation must be preformed within two hours, or it will be fatal. Dr. Johnson wants to know if you can be ready in 2 hours? Yes sir, I'll tell him. - Dr. Lee will be ready in 2 hours. - Can we get Katie to Capitol City in 2 hours? - Yes, yes, we'll take my plane, come on. - Tell Dr. Lee we'll be there. We're starting now. Come on, let's get going. This is Dr. Johnson. I need a resuscitator at the airport right away. Thank-you. Thank-you. Beach 801. Take straight in approach. Runway 7 R. Winds 90.15. Out. Beach 801, Roger. Taxi to south end of field, where ambulance is waiting. Katie's fine Mrs. Washburn, she's going to be all right. May we see her doctor? I'm sure it's all right. She's asleep but she'll wake up at any moment. We taken her to a room on the floor below. This way please. That's some really good news doctor. Oh this is Dr. Lee who performed the operation. - How do you do Doctor? - This is John McFarland. And this is Blake Washburn, the little girl's brother. Mr. Washburn, your sister is okay. It's lucky you were able to get her here in time. Thank-you doctor Lee. - Oh, pardon me. - Well, well, one of my motors. Thanks again Dr. Lee. Yes, thank-you Doctor. Blake. Rain again? You've been threatening rain for three days. - The front page ready? - Here it is. - Hello Slim. - Blake. Katie still doing all right? Yes, she's fine. I just talked with mother in Capitol City. That's good news. - Thanks Slim for helping to save Katie. - A lot of things helped save her life. Yes, I know. Why, nothing. Hold it. I've got something I want to say. Still printing facts? You know Slim. Seven hours ago John McFarland came in here with a pet theory I didn't think was worth printing. Theories have a funny way of becoming facts. If you're looking for your letter of resignation, I'm typing on the back of it. Okay boss. Slim, I haven't heard you laugh like that in a long time. Janice how would you like to marry a guy who is editor of the Fairbanks Herald? Oh, I'd like that. - Hey Rags! - Where did he come from? You've got to learn to keep out of private offices. You've caused enough trouble for one day.
