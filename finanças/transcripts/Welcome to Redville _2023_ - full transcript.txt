Eros and Venus fell in love... but began to neglect their heavenly duty. So Zeus separated them and Venus fell to Earth and cried for 100 years. The tears dripped into the soil and were changed into diamonds so that Eros could follow the jewels back to his true love. Did he ever find her? Some believe he's still looking.
