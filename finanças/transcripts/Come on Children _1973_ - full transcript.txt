Like, I mean, sometimes somebody will – Like, in a relationship... one of the sides will want somebody and need somebody more than the other. - But it's gotta be a shifting of it. - I've been pregnant for nine months, right? It should be me more depending on Gary rather than Gary depending on me. - And it hasn't been that way. - And it should swing. - It's been Gary depending on me all nine months. - It shouldn't be all one side. And that's not good. It's been me that's had to say, “Gary, go get your hair cut.” Okay? So he went and got his hair cut, which was great. Then I said, “Gary, go out and get a job.” But he's not a two-year-old boy. He's 20 years old. He should do it on his own. He should say, “Well, I love Sharon. I'm having a baby. I love the baby. I want to marry her, so I'm gonna go out and get a job.” But he hasn't. - “...support as best as I can.” - Right. Jane, have you seen my son, Justin? - I wanna see your baby. - Lesley saw him yesterday. Alex, he doesn't look like you. I hate to say that. He looks like Charlene. I told Lesley that. I said, “I don't want to tell Alex... 'cause Alex told me he looked like him, but he does look like Charlene.” Everybody told me that he looked like me when I was a baby. I used to be a baby. - I used to be one too. - Really? What a coincidence. - I've never seen you when you were a baby, so I don't know. - That's true. Where are you? I'm somewhere. I don't know where, but I'm somewhere. - You're right here. - Yeah. I know. But I'm just trying to figure out where I'm at. - Right here. - I'm here, but where I'm at. - Do you know why you're doing dope? - Noreen. - Express your feelings. - No, you don't. - Oh, I think you do. - No, you don't. You think you do 'cause – - 'Cause it takes that. - Through dope. - Whoa. There it goes. - Well, I love dope. All's I can say is I'm glad it's not the guys that have the kids. All I can say is I'm sorry it's not the guys that have the kids. 'Cause if guys had the kids... then guys would be getting knocked up all the time. That would be no fun. - Do you know what I heard on some show? - Ew! Did you see that? The picture the Toronto Telegram ran recently of a human fetus in a garbage can. Do you know what I read somewhere – Or if it was on a TV show. That the Russians have discovered a way of birth control that goes by the zodiac. It goes by the stars. Last night, you were just saying you don't believe in this bullshit. No, I don't, but they say that they tested it, and it proves to be 95% true... and they can tell whether it's going to be a girl or boy. - What do you mean, 95% safe? - Yeah. They wanna try it on about 5,000 women... but, like, no 5,000 women wanna give it the – - the old, uh – - Try. College try. If a woman gets pregnant and wishes it terminated for any reason... - then I insist she has that right. - Yeah. - No, she doesn't. No, she doesn't. - I mean, for an older person – I agree with that. She should have that, shouldn't she? - She doesn't have the right. - I don't know. Like, I'm still both ways. Because I don't believe in abortion. I think it is murder. It's like saying – It's the same way as me saying you have a right to live or die. - Yeah. - Yeah, it is. - You're setting yourself up as the judge. - I don't think you should live, so – That's like mercy killing. You believe in mercy killing, I suppose. - I believe in mercy killing. - Yeah, so do I, but I don't believe in abortion. - It's really hard, 'cause it's – - You believe in mercy killing? I don't know that I would want to live. - I try – You have to decide for yourself. - The only answer is in stopping it before it starts. - Right. - Just no balling! That's it. Well, you don't have to do that. But, um, no, I agree with you. You have to – You have to start it before it st – You have to stop it before it – Willpower. That's the key. Willpower. It's best through the mouth at a certain level. Oh, wow. It's some acid. I'm deciding why the cameramen are trying to drive us – Oh, well. Looks good, whatever it is. I'm going downstairs. Cameramen are very dedicated. In other words, it's a subtle way of telling the camera to fuck off. It's really buggin' me.

That's the end, and no more. - There's no danger for you, 'cause you've got a willpower. - Yeah, I know that. You know? It's different with me. I didn't – I didn't have any willpower at all. Or what willpower I had, the, uh, speed took care of that. That's so strange. How'd you finally quit? Was it any one decision, or were you just getting so screwed up that you had to? Yeah. I was gettin' really screwed up. No, not physically. Just, you know, I didn't – - In your head. - Yeah. Like, you know, you're fuckin' up everybody and just... preferring the needle to friends and stuff. It was different with me though. I was, like, hitting at school... and hittin' at home. Sounds like you were pretty lonely up until – Hitting at home, sitting alone, like, you know, just... late at night about 3:00 in the morning. Scraping together a hit out of the bottom of a bag. Yeah. That's a pretty cheesy hit. It's just that speed is so good. If it wasn't so bad as well. How is it? - Pretty good. - As good as the first one? You have got me so tempted. Golly. Why don't you do one? I'm not going to. - I told him no. - You promised too. Yeah, I know. I didn't really promise. I made a point that I wasn't going to. We'll make you keep that point. Yeah, I told John to make sure I did. So, Wednesday, I'll just go buy lots of weed. 'Cause I'm goin' crazy... 'cause the only thing in this house is chemicals. Nobody does them here. Rick said, um, if I can find somebody that'll trade all that acid for some weed... he'll give me the acid to trade. I wasn't sure whether to come up or not, 'cause I was, like, oh – 'Cause I remember, one day, I walked in in the middle of it – and I scared the shit out of the guy... and he, you know, pulled his arm and it ripped. His arm opened, so... I was always scared to walk into a room. Kind of, “Yoo-hoo, I'm coming.” Warn them before. I just – One night, I was speeding... and I just looked at everything I'd been doing... and I said, “Fuck, I'm such a liar. I tell so many lies.” And then it wasn't with my parents anymore. It was just with everybody. And so, like, I told lies all over. I said, “This is gonna be awful if my life is gonna be like this... if this is the person I'm gonna be for the rest of my life.” So I just decided I had – what I should do is tell them as many lies... as I could remember I told them, even if it was too much for them... and they said, “Sorry, we can't have you here. Fuck off.” - At least I'd be – At least I'd be clean. - You'd be better. - And I'd be able to – So I did that. - Did you do that? - Yeah, I went home one day – - That's fuckin' weird. One day, I went and – The rotten thing was I did it – I almost had to do it speeding, which I wouldn't have liked to do. I wanted to do it straight so I knew it was what I wanted to do. But I was – But I was speeding when I was thinking about it. And so I went to school... hit up two downers – Valiums, you know? And then I just sat down and I got – That brought me down. Like I was just crashing, but it brought me straight, you know? And then I still knew I had to do it. So I went in, I phoned home. This is about 10:00. My mom got out of bed, and I said... “Mom, there's something really important I got to talk to you about... “and could-could-could – could you phone Dad? Is Dad home”? She said, “No, he's out for work.” I said, “It's very – I got to talk to you about it... “and it's something that can't wait. “And could you call Dad and tell him to come home from work right now... and-and be back and” – And so she said okay. She says – I said, “I'll come back at noon.” And so – And so I sat around waiting till about noon... just sitting there underneath a tree, shivering just like – And it was on a warm day. And – And then, like, about noon – And I wanted to run away so bad. I wanted to just get on the 401 and go to Montreal. You know, just – just fuck off so bad. And-And – But I just got up... and I just practically had to close my eyes and walk home – and walk home. But the last 20, 30 yards home, I was just walkin' like this. You know, so slow. And then, I-I got – I walk up the driveway... and I didn't know whether to ring the bell. I open the door and walk in, and the house was so quiet. And I walked upstairs and I walked in the living room... and sat down in a chair and just sat there and waited for them to walk in. And then they walked – Then my mom came in, sat down on the couch. And-And she – My dad wasn't home yet. And, but-but I knew I had to start. I just had to start talkin', or else I would never – Like, you know? And so I said, “Mom, I can't wait. I can't wait. I gotta start talkin', or I won't be able to talk at all.” Then my dad came home, and I was crying. I was crying so bad after a while. And it was just pouring out. And I just told them everything I'd done. I showed them my tracks, you know, on my arms. And I just told them – I just told them everything. All the times I, like-like – And they knew most of it. That's the thing. They had known all of it practically. Except, like, a lot of it was just they knew something was going on... but they couldn't, like, put their finger. And they suspected a lot of things, but-but – - After it, the air was so clear. - I know what you's gettin' at. And-And I was just – I just looked up at 'em, and I was just – We just, like – I just knew that I was gonna be able to do it with them, you know? Yeah. And it even took a while after that to stop telling lies to them. Like – Like I even hit a couple times after that. I told them once when I hit. I just told them the next day, “I hit last night.” - You know? - What'd they do? They were disappointed. They said they were disappointed. But, see, that's what I did. I told them. - I told them, like – - Yeah, that's good. I told them – When I was telling them, I said, “I'm into speed, and it's hard – “I've tried to stop before. I don't think I'll be able to stop right – completely... but I'll try and tell you whenever I hit.” I told them they could make an appointment for the Addiction Research Foundation. And they did. I got a shrink. - She's got everything. - That's great. Hi! How are you? Look. You can see what I knitted him. He's just starting to wake up. He was sleeping. - Hi, John. - Sharon. Hello, Jason. How are you? Oh. Isn't he cute? - Jason, open your eyes. - He's coughing. He's choking. No, he's not. He's gonna cry because he's hungry. - Aw. - Has he – Does he talk and – - Oh, yeah. He runs all around the house. I can't catch him. - I mean cry, open his eyes or anything? He only opens one eye all the time. - Open your other eye. - He's winking. I wanna see what you look like. He likes me. Sharon, he's got no eyes. - No, he won't open – - Yes, he will. I'll get all the blankets. - Oh, they were big. - Yeah. Hey, don't fall asleep. It's hard to believe that we were that small at one time. - Does he eat a lot? - Not really. - Does he cry a lot? - No. Drugs. Come on. Look so peaceful when they're sleeping. Yeah. Sleep like a baby. He's like my son. Didn't you breast-feed him at all? No, 'cause if you're going to bottle-feed them, they don't like you breast-feeding them... unless you're going to continue breast-feeding them. 'Cause it's hard to switch them. I guess it's a lot easier like this, eh? Doctor didn't think I should anyways... 'cause he said I was too erratic to breast-feed him.

I had a brush cut every minute of the day. Every day, seven days a week. Fourteen days – every two weeks. And then I'd get another one. And it was so great just having a brush cut... and I could run my hand through my hair like this. And it just felt so great, like – I don't know. Like it – It kind of felt like a brush, you know? I guess that's why they call it a brush cut. ♪ Come on, children come on It's some tail, boy, that cat's got. Listen, so you guys understand, like, at our house... when my little sister Annie – - I don't know if you met her or not. - Yeah. She's allergic to about 20 different things, right? And one of them's cats. Oh, definitely. All animals, but other things too. And, like, it's very dangerous allergies... and it's absolutely impossible for us to have animals in the house. Yeah. And my little sister Ellen, with the red hair – - I don't know if any of you met her – - Yeah, I did. And she's really, really sensitive, and she really likes animals really badly. So I was talking about getting a dog and everything. And so she's always bringing back animals – Shut up. And so when I got back... I found out that my little sister had found this one over by the apartments... and brought it home and hid it in the basement for two days... 'cause she didn't want my dad to throw it out. Isn't that touching? And so, like, I knew you guys didn't want a cat... and I knew you didn't want a mangy cat... and so – I told my dad I'd take it and, like, drop it off in Newcastle, right? 'Cause I figured the people around here wouldn't be like Toronto people... and if they found a cat runnin' around, they'd take into their house. Just like we do all the time. And so – I just told him I'd drop it off in Newcastle. And then here's the touching part. Here's the real touching – - You just couldn't do it. - This'll kill you. No, I wouldn't have been able to do that. I wouldn't have been able to do that, 'cause it's a pretty big mangy cat. And so – But then Ellen came wandering into the room... and she found out, and so she come up to me and said... “Oh, John, good. Are you gonna take it out to the farm and keep it there?” So I said yeah. So now I have to. So that's my story. - “Can I stay here?” - Look at its tail. Isn't it groovy? It's been fendin' all for itself for three weeks in the snow. That's why it's got a tail. It's been eatin' snow. You know what's amazing? This cat, like, for three weeks... it's been eating out of garbage cans, living in snowbanks. And now it's coming up to the best life a cat has ever led in its whole entire life... - having a whole farmhouse – - Yay! having a whole farmhouse, 10 people to pet it all the time... - and feed it all kinds of – - Where's the cat food? I got another important statement to make. Now listen. Alex, this involves you too. Sit down. Okay. Now – Now here's the thing. Noreen gets that much – a third, cause she put in 25 bucks. And this – So two-thirds cost me 50 bucks. I don't care if anybody wants to go on a straight trip or whatever... you know, and not smoke, that's cool. - But, like – - Well, we're smoking ours. But I'm gonna smoke – Like, I wanna smoke it... and I think anybody that's gonna be smoking, as well, like, should help pay for it. - You know? - Yeah. - Ta-da. - So the cat plays in the basement? He plays with the other cats. I was just – That's all. Oh, John. Don't take it out of the wrapper. It's too crumbly. Okay? It's cool. It's out. - Did you ever have drinking clothes? - What? - Drinking clothes. - I had a drinking coat. - Drinking clothes. - Clothes you drank out of? - No, when you used to go drinking. - No, I used to never go drinking. - Oh. - I never used to go drinking. We have special clothes for it. She never learned – I had a neat pair of shorts. - I had a neat pair of shorts, right? - Shorts with French bottoms, right? - No. - They weren't Madras? - They were flipped over. - Oh, those kind. - And they had puke on 'em. - Puke. Yeah, what else? - All kinds of shit. Beer. - Shit. Beer. Everything you can name. And my special shirt. “Sock it to me” on it. Every time someone poured a bottle of wine over you... - every time, you went, “Sock it to me.” - Exactly. Exactly. I know exactly what you mean. Right, John? Are you guys just smoking? Have we got a toker? - Yeah. - That's a bummer. I got a toker in my room. I got a whole bunch of neat things in my room. All for smoking. Into the old catnip again. It's hungry anyways. Hey, cat. Psst! You have this way of communicating with cats, Al. - Yeah, I know. - It's just incredible. I don't know how you do it. - Let's see what Jamie – - Watch this. Watch this. Jamie comes by. Nice guy, you know. Watch this. Let him do something first. Did you guys try and bring him out, and he clawed at you? No. He attacked Jamie. No. Jamie came walking by him – scratched him in the face. Well, Jamie did that to a lot of cats, too, when he first came here. - No, he didn't. - The new cat was eating. And Jamie came up beside him. Like, he wasn't eating or anything. And he started growling, which was kind of – I don't know, maybe cats growl, but – Then he took a good swipe at Jamie, tried to bite him. So I hit him, and he took off rather quickly. Too fucking much, eh? That's really too fuckin' much. Ellen's gonna be real proud of me. Fuck. Ah, well. I guess you'll be okay. Just a fuckin' tomcat anyway. You think they were great, or what? No, the munchkins, you know. They did it. I think it was a diabolical plot. - You think so? - Yeah, I do. - Yeah. - Oh, I kind of – 'Cause no one in the house knows that we did it yet. - Well – - And they wouldn't suspect us. - Why, 'cause we're all sweet and – - Yeah. This whole house is upside-down. Oh, get outta here. Didn't Jo Anne feed them this morning? She never feeds them. Mmm. - Well, I wonder who did that. - I don't know, Ken. That's a really fucking intelligent move. That's for sure. I hope they're gonna clean it up. - I like it like that. - So do I. - I don't, eh? - Puts a little life into this place. - Yeah. - It's awful dead in here. I hope they're gonna clean it up. - Doesn't matter. - Didn't you hear Ken? He likes it that way. Fuck. I'll go get a room at the hotel, then, and stay there and come out here every day. - I'm not gonna live in this pigpen. - It's only five bucks a night. - How much is it? - Five bucks a night. - I'm not eating here anymore. I'm going to the restaurant from now on. - That's right. How ya do? Oh, all right, eh? Jane. - How are you? - Pretty good. So what do you think of the morning's activities? - Not too much. - Not too much? We're gonna buy you some coloring books when we go into town. - Oh, thank you. - Keep you occupied. If there's nothing more for you to do downstairs, why don't you start on the upstairs now? If it's all that bad up here, why don't you just leave? Like, that was pretty stupid and immature, Ken. - I don't think so. - I'm really surprised. I don't think so. Yeah, well, that's probably because you were one of the persons that did it. - Yep. - I think – What was the whole purpose of anything? When we were talking last night – You'll get the purpose after a while. You're gettin' it now. - Hmm? - You're getting it now. - The purpose? - Yep. I'm glad you think so. No. You really think I'm a prick, but I'm trying to do you a favor. I thought it was kind of funny myself. It wasn't. Oh, I thought it was. It's just so – so frustrating. You get up out of bed, first thing that happens to you is you get egg cartons on your head. You walk into the living room, you can't sit down anywhere. Go into the kitchen, you can't sit down anywhere in there. There's no dishes clean, so you can't have breakfast. So I washed my own dishes. Okay, that's fair enough. I probably dirtied them. That's fair enough. I wasn't complaining about that, but it sort of just all added up together... to being how I feel right now, which is completely disgruntled. Really angry. Fuck! This place is a mess. Of course. Ah. Cigarette butts. My favorite. I want some – Hey! Nobody comes in here, nobody makes anything until the garbage is cleaned up. 'Cause I've just fucking had it. Every time I come in to cook something in here, it's like this. Look at this. You know how long that's been there, Les? From last week's shopping. A week ago. Fuck off, dog. Um – - What do you need? - Where is everybody? There's nobody here. - Where are they? - People went to the district. - Everybody went – - In here. I'm not cookin' nothin'. I'm not goin' in that kitchen... until everything gets cleaned up off the counters, which includes jam. That's been jam there for a couple of days now. Old biscuits that have been there for a week. - And the floor. There's a lot of junk - on the floor all of a sudden. - You should see the floor. Like, I'm not fuckin' doin' nothin' anymore until that's cleaned up. - Oh, we'll get it done. - That's what you say every time. - When? You can't walk in the kitchen. - I don't know. After I finish my cigarette. Why don't you fucking come out and finish it in the kitchen? Okay. - Oh, after I finish it. - No. Come out right now, Noreen. - Oh, Alex. - Come on out right now and look. Well, who's ever supposed to do dishes does 'em at night. Then the cooks can do their own dishes during the day... 'cause we don't cook breakfast or lunch. And then again the supper people clean up the supper dishes. And whoever makes food during the day can clean their own dishes after them. Well, I feel – I think it's about time for a switch. I'd rather cook than do dishes. I wouldn't mind it if somebody came in and did something right now. Oh, we're comin'. We just wanted to finish this cigarette before we came in. It's too bad I don't smoke. Let's go, Noreen. Okay. Little troublemaker. Let's go. You wash. I'll dry. I think Lesley's washing. We're drying. Okay, I'll supervise then. Well, well, well. Pass it over. Step in. - Here, Noreen. Here's your smokes. - Fine. - Thank you. - You guys are cooking tonight. - Oh, would you like to clean up? - We're cookin' tomorrow night too. And the night after that. - You guys, uh, can cook from now on. - We are. - If you wanna cook, you can cook. - Yeah. - We do. - We were just discussing that. - Which three people want to take over? - Yeah – Yeah, which three people – - Us three. - Us three. Did you wanna start cooking, Lesley? Not with bad feelings. - Well, no, if – if other people want to, uh – - Feels like bad feelings from you. If other people want to cook instead of wash dishes, that's all right with me. I'll wash dishes. I don't care. - Great. - I just hope you have fun making food for 10 people... and see why we always scream and yell about dirty kitchens. - Les, you get to do the shopping too. - I can't handle that. - We can handle it. - You and Noreen can, then, if you want. 'Cause I – I know I can't. - Okay. The ham is right there. - No. - Is it unfrozen? - Not quite. We'll see. What else are you gonna make, Ken? Like, what else is gonna be for dinner? - We don't know what's – - Mashed potatoes. ...and you wanna cook. Just think when they don't get any good groceries. - What? - There's been a what? - Wait a minute. Who isn't cooking then? - We just switched. - You three are cooking. - You, me and Noreen are cooking. - Noreen, do you know how to cook? - No. Um, no. If you don't know how to cook – I have had four years' cooking experience. Okay. All right. Why wouldn't you put vinegar and ketchup on ham? - Vinegar and ketchup? - Yeah. - You put cloves and mustard and brown sugar. - And vinegar and ketchup. - Ooh! - Oh, you've never had ham with ketchup? - We're not having vinegar on our ham. - Oh, yes, we are. - We're not having ketchup on our ham either. - This is gonna be fun. - Don't you know nothin'? Don't you know nothin'? - Look, we're fighting already about the food. We haven't even started. - We'll manage. - Ah, it should be fun. - Not that thick, Rick. - The tin always falls off. - It's supposed to be an inch and a quarter thick. - No, make 'em three quarters to an inch. Well, that's what that is, three quarters of an inch. - Is it? - Yeah. Let's just slice it up and cook it in a frying pan. We'll have to ask Alex whether it's cooked or not, and I don't think he knows. It's probably already cooked. So we'll just slice it up and throw it in a frying pan. If it ain't cooked – - You don't put it in a frying pan. You put it in the oven. - In the frying pan. - No! Are you kidding? You don't cook ham in a frying pan. - You do. - You do not! - You do. - Are you kidding? - No, I'm not. - Frying food is the worst way you can cook it. We need you to find all the troops. Fourth? - Well, who isn't? That's a better question to ask. - Who isn't eating? Okay. Then that's eight. Right? - Is Jane eating out? - Ask Jane. She's right there. Are you eating out? - I'm not eating! - Why not? - Don't like ham. - Neither do I. - I don't like ham either. - I just remembered. Well, if no one likes ham, why are we cooking a big ham? - 'Cause I'll eat three pieces of it. - 'Cause we bought it. - 'Cause Al and I will eat it. - The cat! Do you know – Do you know if this ham is partially cooked... or if it's completely uncooked? - Sharon, do you know? - What? - If the ham is cooked or not? - The what? - The ham. - I don't know anything about it. Has anybody seen my brush? - What's it look like? - Brown. And it's got bristles on it. What's wrong? I put the corn on low. Supper! Okay. Where's John? I don't know. It looks great. - How was your sleep? - It was good. Whose – Whose chair am I taking here? Can you pass me over that – one of those plates there, Jane? This ham tastes really good. It's the first time I've ever enjoyed eating ham. - Of course. - Really. Orange juice. - Is it frozen? - No. - All right? - Mmm. I love to have orange juice now. It's good, isn't it? - It was fine, wasn't it? - Yeah. It was pretty good. Phyllis! No! Do you know how much problems I've had with this? To try and get two blotters of acid... I had to walk all the way around this entire house looking for change. In there, entwined in something. I don't know what was happening. And all I got is – is three pieces of paper and what's in my wallet. No, it's something else. She's going nuts. She's flippin' out. - Don't hang on to her hair, Rick. - She got puke in her hair? Come on, Sue. Sit up here. Gosh, don't put your head in it. I wasn't. Are you okay now?

We crashed in this place. Like, we were staying there. We rented it for a week for $10. A room for $10. - And, uh, this guy – - The limit was 40 people to one room. And it was about – no bigger – about twice the size of this room. And one night when we were sleeping there, the other half of the building burnt down. - Hey. - What? - I can't go to sleep. - Why? 'Cause I woke up 'cause you couldn't sleep. Go back to sleep. I can't. It's not even 7:00. What did you do to it? Hmm? - It's out in the barn. - When? Yesterday. What time is it? Dear Paul... I've been reading, and I want to tell you about a book. It's The Stone Angel by Margaret Laurence. It came at a strange time for me. I guess I really am afraid of growing old. You know, everyone I know dying off, so that I'm the only one left. Sometimes I get lonely and I think about finding someone to spend my life with. But then I think that he'll be the only one who'll know me... and I'm sure he'll die and leave me old and hopeless. The book really scared me. The story is told by an old lonely woman named Hagar... who had lost her husband and really had had no friends. She lived with her son and daughter-in-law. They loved her. Only she thought that they treated her like a child... because she was so old and helpless. All the time that she was flashing back, Hagar was living her other life in the present. Her son and his wife wanted to put her in an old folk's home... but she ran away and ended up on a beach in an old cannery. While she was there she met a stranger, and they got drunk... and finally she was open. She talked about her favorite son and how he'd been killed. And for the first time, she cried about it. It was strange that she had to pretend to be strong with the people who were closest to her... but she could be sick and old and afraid with a stranger. She died in the end, and I cried and cried... terrible old woman that she was. It was a great book, and I'm glad I read it when I did. Thank you for being there. Love, Les. Play it as you know you can play it, like with extra mouth work. Put it down really like that. Yeah. 'Cause it's an alto. Should go low. I think this cording's different or something. ♪ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♪ ♪ Da, da Da, da, da, da ♪ He's not getting spoilt when he's crying. He's just getting scared. Like when he wakes up and nobody's around. Like, you know, when nobody's around. And he cries a lot, 'cause he's just afraid 'cause no one's around. And it's good to pick him up and rock him a little... and just put him – put your hand on him or something. Then he goes to sleep. I think he's getting spoilt too. - Why? - Because he even cries when I'm in the room. Right? I mean, you've been here when we rock him – everything. He still cries. Soon as you pick him up, he stops. You gonna phone your mother tomorrow? Yeah. See if she'll take the baby for a week. I wonder if Gary will come over. - Over to my place? - Yeah. If he wants to. If she wants to call him, tell him to come up and see him, that's up to her. I won't be there, so I don't care. What did you say in the letter anyway? Or do you want to talk about it? I just told him that I thought it would be better if we broke up. That I'd probably be happier then. That if I stayed with him, probably only be because I felt sorry for him... which wouldn't be good for me. What's that? I'm straightening my hair. I'm straightening my hair. - Straightening it? - Yeah. - Why? - 'Cause it's a drag. Now, how does that feel, John? You can't feel it till she starts squishing it through, and then it feels like come, I think. - We should get everyone in here to do it. - Yeah. Get everyone in here and do it. - Oh. - You're not supposed to rub it in, you know. - What are you supposed to do? - It says don't rub it into the scalp. You're just supposed to mix it around. - I had it done at Mr. Ivan's. - Says it should take about 10 minutes. And she did – The lady took about 10 minutes to do it. - Have you had it done before? - Just by – Just by a hairdresser at Mr. Ivan's. - I thought Mr. Ivan's was a ladies' salon. - Supposed to comb it out, John? - No, he isn't. - Supposed to comb it, John? - What about the rest of this stuff? - Hey – No – Just – You gotta put it all on, Noreen. Can't stick it on. It won't fit. - Okay. - Uh-oh. Low on his forehead. - Oh, that's pretty, John. - Yeah. Really? - I think it's backwards. - No, it's not. I already read the directions. - Little stars. - Oh, I see. - Oh, they even give you a turban. - What's this for? To suck on? While I'm waiting? There's a piece sticking out. Oh, John. Ow. Bunny ears. Eh? Hi, Jane. Hi, Brandy. Brandy, Brandy, Brandy. - Phew. - - Didn't even bother putting last names anymore. - How about some introductions? - Okay. That's Wes, Ronnie, Valerie, Cathy... my mom, Claire and me. That's Jo Anne, Rick, John... Lesley, Mrs. Henry – - Anna? - Anne. - Anne – - Alan. Alan, Jane, Sharon. - Well, you've got lots of space anyway. - Yeah. That's another bedroom. Yeah. So the only way through that one is through here? Or from the kitchen. Oh, my goodness. You won't want to come home. Well, this looks more tidy than your room at home, Noreen. That's 'cause I had to clean it up. Probably the first time it's looked like this. He – He's all right, but he's not very well. He's all right today, but he was sick yesterday. Badly sick. I didn't want to leave him today, but... I did. Hi, Johnny. How are you doing? - Grab a parcel. - How are you? - I miss you. - Yeah, I missed you too. - I'm the doorman. - You're the doorman? - Okay. Well, take care of that. - Oh, thanks. I was waiting for a buck or something, you know. Okay. Great. Oh, it's ever crowded here today. How have you been? Hi, Mom. My father, the musician. How you doing, Dad? - Another one. How are you? - Runs in the family. - Really. What? Wanna see my scrapbook? - Oh, really? Pikey made it for me. Pikey brought it up. She made it. All those little pictures in there. This was about three, I guess you'd be. Where's – Yeah, that's when I was fishin'. - Here's Ma. - After a New Year's party. Hasn't changed at all. There's me playing hockey. And that's Dad handing UNICEF – president of whatever, the little kids league. So I was looking at my dad – This is my big one. Look at this. A write-up in the Toronto Star on Oklahoma! John Hamilton as Ali Hakim. “Hamilton, small and ingenious, systematically deadpanned his way... “into the affections of a capacity audience... that eventually had no choice but to acknowledge him one of the evening's great favorites.” Take that. In the Toronto Star! Mm-hmm. You take care too, and don't forget. Be thinking about what you're going to do after the whole thing's over, okay? - All right. - Have your mind made up already? - Higher school, a job – Okay? - Yeah. All right. - All right. Be a good boy. - Oh, yeah. - Do everything you're supposed to do. - Oh, yeah. - Help out with the chores. - All right. All right. - And no nonsense, eh? - Oh, no. Okay. And so, by September, we'll be completely out of debt... and, like, just from the money we'll be making. Like, you know, each – It'll be $80 a night... that we'll be making. - And – - Each? Yeah. And that's all right with me. You know, it's easy to be optimistic... - when you have security behind you. - Yes. But just think that you have nothing to rely on. - Maybe he goes wrong – - What are you going to do then? Maybe he goes wrong and he learned something. And you go back to – - But he went wrong, and he didn't learn still. - What – What – Whatever went – - When did I go wrong? - Oh, right. Everything went wrong with him so far. - You're a big mistake. - If you can earn $80 a night... then he must've accomplished something. - He's capable of playing an instrument. - He is a talented boy, yes. He's, uh – Like, I don't want to make a bunch of money. Like, if I make a lot of money, that's great. But I'm not gonna go to university and get a big degree. - You won't last long, Alex. - Hang on. No, I don't. I don't – I don't want to drive around in a big car and get people to go... “Hey, there goes Alex. He's loaded with money. Wow, he's really set himself up great.” - That's not – - That's what I mean. Aren't you rejecting though the-the – the things that are good... for the things that are bad? Can't you – Can't you exclude the bad ones? Well, to me, the things that are good are things that I like to do. - Knowledge is good, isn't it? - Would I be happy with it? Yeah, knowledge. But who wants to know how much atmospheric pressure... is on five milligrams of mercury? Stuff like that. That's not gonna help me. I don't see why I have to go through all the – the bullshit of high school to learn music. I'm just gonna... hang around and feel it for a while. - And then I'll learn it. - You'll learn – What do you feel right – What do you feel right now? Right now? What do I feel? I'm a little angry. - Why? - 'Cause – Because with parents, I notice – All parents have this – Well, not all of 'em. I won't say all of them. But I notice a lot of parents have this great difficulty... of listening to their kids, and it is so true. Okay. You want to say you know better. No, I'm not saying that, Dad. I'm just saying that it would be really great... - if parents would sit down and listen to what kids say, like what their kids say. - You see – Hang on. Listen to what their kids say... and go, “Well, it's good that you feel that way. Now this is the way I feel.” Instead of parents going, “No, no, no. That's all wrong. You gotta feel like this. This is how you gotta feel.” Like, parents – I don't know if parents really care about how their kids feel. - Oh, that's – That's jumpin' a little – - No, no. Not – No. I worded that wrong. Hang on. I don't know if parents – - Understand. - care if their kids will turn out the way they want to, like the kids want to. It's – Like, it's more the parents want their kids to turn out like they want them to. Don't forget one thing, that every parent, he has natural instinct. Just like a rudder. You know, he foreseen what's going to happen to his offsprings. And whatever the parent feel, it happens... most of the time. You are not really, actually a parent yet. Yeah. It's different. - He hasn't said anything. - I'm just listening. Kids today – Kids today just want to make us look odd – old. And you kids want to be so wise – experienced. What do – What – What kind of experience you have? What kind of experience? What did you went through? You know, one of the disappointing things is to see some opportunities available... and they're not being made use of. That's disheartening, no matter what stage of life you're in as a parent. - Early – Early or late. - It's not that we're forcing Alex to go to university right now or anything. We're just asking a little favor of him just to finish grade 12. Just grade 12. And then he's on his own. You know, for a while, because... if that's what he wants – you know, music – I know I couldn't force him into grade 12, just like I couldn't force him to cut his hair... or do a lot of other things, you know, that he went wrong. I just accepted and I helped him, and I support him, in fact. - Well, but he stated – he stated – - And his father and I – that he never had a chance to do what he wants. - He – He always did what he wants. - If he didn't have our support – I have said to you, Alex – and I remember exactly – I want you to be free, to expand. I don't want you to grow up with a – with a fear... o-o-of something – some terror. Of what? Of – Of anything. What do you want? That's what I want to know really. Alex, could you tell us – You had all freedom... like anytime, you know, you came home whenever you wanted. Y-You did whatever you wanted. - Okay. What do I need to back me up? - Let's talk about the present right now. Okay. What do I need to back me up? Okay. How would you live? - How would I live? - Yeah. - How do you mean? - You want to live on your own. How would I live? How do you mean how would I live? Where you gonna rent apartment and practice, make such a racket – - That's not – - like you do in our house? Did I say that I'm gonna rent a place and we're gonna practice there? - No, but you – - You can always play in halls... or places above music stores or under music stores. - Things like that. - Are they giving that for free? No, of course not. - You'll have to pay all those things. - That's right. - And you have to pay your instruments. - That's right. You'll have other expenses, accommodation. You're opposing... just to be different, you see. Well, if you want to be truthful with yourself... whatever we had discussion before, and I point to you... what could happen in life – what could happen to you – - Did it happen? - Such as? Having children? Taking dope? Stuff like that? - Yes. - Sure, it's happened. - Why, Alex? - Why? I don't know. - But it did – - 'Cause... some things happened. Other things I wanted to do. - Was it good? - Find out for myself. I think it is. - It was good? - Yeah. - But then you just leave those things on the side. You have no responsibility. - Oh, do I? Do I? Do I leave things on the side? Do I leave my son on the side? - I don't. - Well – - No, I don't. - Well, you're never around. Yeah, I'm never around because she never brings him over. She never lets me know about anything... unless she wants some money. - Oh, she doesn't, uh – - Oh, yeah? She hasn't called in two months. Then she gives you a call asking how Alex is... and how she's spent all her welfare checks on her clothes. She doesn't give me a chance to see him. I won't give her money. I'll make sure it gets to him. She won't see any of it. That's for sure.

I know it.” Jo Anne says, “No, I vouch for her. She's not. She just got up.” I just got up, but I was awful stoned. This is the last meal we're gonna have together. No, I don't wanna – Yee-haw!

There it goes. Ohh! - Ohh! I'm getting sick watching it! - Hey, keep going, John! Just a little bit. In the bathtub. So close, man. So close. I was that close to holding it in. That close. John, you're too much. Oh, John! You gonna drink your other two bottles like that tomorrow... - that Noreen and I are getting you? - Ah. I'm hungry. Will they stay? Do you want the rest of mine?

Sam is an A-1 good shit. A-1 good shit. Yeah, I liked both of them. - A lot of times when I smoke – - Mm-hmm. I mean, it's just to get drunk, you know? The same way you like when – mostly when you drink. But then there's, like... doin' some work and drinkin' a beer. That kind of gettin' stoned. - Yeah. - You know. Or gettin' stoned and playin' some music. Then there's times when... it can be a special thing. Just like a Belvedere cigarette. See, me and John – Me and John smoke Belvederes. And you just – If no one else is smoking Belvederes somewhere... and John walks in with a Belvedere... we can just go down and sit down somewhere... listen to some Bob Dylan music and smoke a Belvedere cigarette. You know? Same thing with getting stoned with John. You know? Just – It smells. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. Something's bothering you. Just about tonight. What about it? We talked a lot. But I don't know, like – You know, we haven't settled anything. Didn't arrive to anything. It's just kinda left there. I feel kinda confused. I don't know. I don't know what to do about it. How about if we just let things go... and see how they work out. Okay. I'd like to think about it. Is that all right? Yeah. I'd like to stay. I'd like to stay for a little while longer. How long would you stay, if you could stay? I don't know. A few weeks anyways. That – That'd be neat. What are you going back to? Nothin'. Nothin' will change from where I come from, so – How do you mean? Well, I know – I know exactly what's going on there. If you're there or you're not there, you know what's going on anyways. - What's going on? - Nothin'. And what do you plan to do, then, when you get back? Somethin' different than nothin'. - What? - Hopefully. I don't know. Any ideas of how? Yeah, I'd like to go somewhere. - And do? - Nothin'. No, I don't know. I don't know. I'd like to just go see where – what else is going on... in different places. - Watch? - Yeah, watch. Maybe get into it if I really like it. - Into? - Whatever's happenin' elsewhere. - What's a nice sad song, Lesley? - Sing “Down by the River.” - Ah, it's gotta be sad. - “Down by the River” is sad. ♪ Ain't no use in turnin' on your light, girl ♪ ♪ I'm on the dark side of the road ♪ ♪ Still I wish there was somethin' I could do or say ♪ ♪ To make me go and change my mind and stay ♪ ♪ You never did too much talkin' anyway ♪ ♪ Don't think twice, it's all right ♪ ♪ Well, there ain't no use in callin' out my name, girl ♪ ♪ Like you never done before ♪ ♪ It ain't no use in calling out my name, girl ♪ ♪ I can't hear you anymore ♪ ♪ Still I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' ♪ ♪ A-walkin' on down the road ♪ ♪ I once loved a woman ♪ ♪ A child I am told ♪ ♪ She wanted my heart but all she got was my soul ♪ ♪ Don't think twice, 'cause it's all right ♪ ♪ Now I'm a-walkin' down that long and lonesome road, babe ♪ ♪ Where I'm bound, I can't tell ♪ ♪ But good-bye's too good a word, babe ♪ ♪ So I'll just say fare thee well ♪ ♪ I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind ♪ ♪ Just kinda went and wasted my precious time ♪ ♪ You could've done better ♪ ♪ I don't mind ♪ ♪ Don't think twice, 'cause it's all right
