Wow, so beautiful. - Boy or girl ? - Girl. Look at her ! She is a beauty ! Congratulations ! You have a beautiful baby. Do your parents know about this ? Look, if you bring a baby here, that means you have nowhere to go. Parents-in-law, relatives, brother, sister, brother-in-law ? We don't have anywhere to go right now but won't stay long. Just until we figure out something. Listen, we will make it work. Just need a screen to separate the room. Like a curtain or something and you can be together. But let me know if you guys need privacy then I will just take a walk. Oh, Laci ! Unfortunately the company policy forbids to have a minor in this work dormitory. All I can do to let you stay one night. Only one night. And only because I understand your problem. I have children and know how it is and I really want to help you but can't do more. I believe your legal guardian is your uncle and it is a huge responsibility. Have you thought this situation through ? Yes. In that case I will give you the phone number of a shelter for young mothers. Hi, baby ! It's Bianka. Yes I know but I was busy doing stuff, and wasn't around but I am back. Are you working where you normally do ? Don't hang up ! Can I come see you ? I just wanna see you, maybe stay for a couple of days. At least today. Who is your girlfriend ? Hello ? Hey ! Come on ! Laura ! Do you like it ? There is a problem. What ? Someone told me that you should go to a shelter. What is a shelter ? She recommended. Didn't she tell what it is about ? Gyuri ! Gyuri ! Tell me ! Gyuri, what is a place for children or shelter for mothers look like ? What is it, Laci ? - Shelter for mothers. - What is that ? A hospital ? Why do I need to go there ? He wants to send me away. Where did you get this ? A lady recommended. What is wrong with this place ? Do you want to send her to a shelter ? Do you have any idea how bad that place it is ? You go to a shelter like that... You will be surrounded by coyotes. Why do you think am I here ? Because my family is separated as well. We had been to those shelters too. Once my woman was walking on the hallway all night long with her baby, our daughter, Rebeka. She couldn't sleep because other kids were screaming. Other mothers did not care about their babies. The mothers went out. They didn't care. Those women will convince you to go out and get a rich guy. Do you understand ? I don't want to say it. Good looking mothers are popular. Well, Laci ? Such is life. No way I go a place like this. Figure something out ! I will find out something. Your tiny feet... Come on ! Hi ! Relax ! Almost there. - Laci, I am gonna take a shower, ok ? - Sure. Forga, mix, sward, loght. - Can we talk ? - What's wrong ? I have a child. Don't joke with me ! Why didn't you tell me ? Did you let her keep the baby ? - Just found out. - Who is the girl ? Fucking good. What are you gonna do now ? Can I borrow money for rent ? I can't believe it this story. Ok, come here with the girl this afternoon and I will tell her what happens. Hi, Laci ! So she is the lady you were talking about. - I am Robi. - Bianka. Yeah. Come on in ! Close it please ! Okay, well. Did you put him to sleep ? Let's not go in the house because the baby is sleeping but we can stay here. I am gonna leave her here to sleep. The dog won't bother her. Come on ! - May I ? - This is your home, isn't it ? We use this trailer for vacation. Explain the situation ! Where did you guys meet ? Tell me something ! We were at a party and then some of us went to Laci's place. - To the work dormitory ? - Yes. Did you take Bianka to the dormitory ? Congrats ! What were you thinking ? Is this child yours at all ? Do we know ? Okay, so what is the plan ? What is your plan ? - What do you do ? - I am looking for a job. - I am sorry, what ? - I am looking for a job. Does that pay good ? Did you look around and see what is going on here ? Do you know how we got this ? We worked for it, honey. Work that we have been doing with Laci for a long time. Laci is a big part of it and I really need him. He is one of my best workers. Am I right ? I am, believe me. This is a job that you have to do immediately when it is requested, not later. 24/7. They call and off we go. I don't understand what your plan is and what I could do to help. Kitty, come in ! That's me. So Laci won't be doing this with you. There is cola in the fridge, take some ! He is a prick. Cool place. Laci, what's the matter ? You look so anxious. You have not danced with your woman. You are stressed. Are you jealous ? You are jealous, right ? Hi, Karesz ! Oh, Gyuri, hello ! What's up ? Listen ! As we have discussed... Meet the guy. Can you drive ? - Not really. - That's not good. I guess you don't have a driver's license. Fuck ! You have no money. All right. Are you sure he is able to do this ? Sure he can do it. Look, Laci, you have to understand something. I am only doing this because of the kid. Three hundred thousand, ok ? I don't have that much. That's fine. You will get a loan. We will do the paperwork. Give me your phone so they can't track you down. This is it. Come on ! What the hell is going on ? Watch out, Laci ! Fuck, it is standing on pedestals. Bianka. - What's up, Laci ? - Look ! What ? Did you seriously get it ? Really ? Oh my god ! Awesome ! All right. Laci, are you happy ? - Yes. - All good ? Is it ok like this ? - Sure. - Okay. Don't forget, dress up nicely tomorrow ! Okay, bye ! Bye, have a good night ! - It only has rubber bullets. - Wow, so heavy. You cock the gun, aim and pull the trigger. What are you doing ? What are you doing tomorrow ? We have some business to do. We will be waiting for you to come home. I will cook something. Okay. I will do laundry, clean, raise the kid. You will work and when we have money we can go to places with the trailer. Laci... Let's catch it, go behind me ! Wait for me there. Be quiet ! Wring her neck ! Come on ! Are you not able to do that or scared ? Take it and wring her neck ! Okay... Let's name her ! Dragon. Hello ! Cute ! Hi ! Now you are free. Give me a wiper !

He has a legal guardian. I can't believe this. Can you fucking believe this, Zoli ? He has a legal guardian. Why didn't you tell me this ? Are you kidding me ? We are fucked. Big time. You understand that you owe me 300,000 forint ? Should I force him to work off his debts ? - Yes. - What ? Yes. Laura. Relax ! The boss sent this to you, your new phone. Hello ! You will continue working on that part like yesterday. Hi there ! Come with me, please ! I show your work site. We are going down here. This is it. I'll show you what to do. Take a brush, dip it in this shit and paint the window. Then use this tool to get rid of the painting. Understood ? Yes, sure. Outgoing calls are not allowed. - Have you had breakfast yet ? - No. Would you like some ? Have some, please ! Do you know what you will be doing ? Lay the fundation. You will work with me.
