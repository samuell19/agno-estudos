Bag it. Yes, sir. It's ready. Pocket a few for yourself. Sir? Everyone does it. Have a taste. You hid your son very well, huh? My apologies. Tell him to visit us. At the prosecutor's office. Nothing will happen to him. Yes, sir. Our cash won't leave you any troubles. Cash without trouble? There's no such thing. But you're still willing to take it? Thank you, Eva! My pleasure, Grandpa. Thank you for doing this. Sorry for the trouble. Scared shitless, but he still took it. No one in this country would turn down that much money. Must have demons in their stomachs, they never get full. Young-jak, come see me later. Yes, madam. You don't have to bow to me like that. Ma'am? Bowing. Like this. I'm serious. Sure. Bye. The bickering never stops. All of them. Politicians, judges, prosecutors, bureaucrats, scholars… They hound us for money, like they're insane over it. But they'll never get rich off such loose change. We made them that way, with our loose change. Where's my son staying tonight? Can we call him? Yes, madam. - Is this secure? - Yes. Son, it's mom. Dad met one of them in person. Gave him a package. The top dog. It's all taken care of, so go over there and wrap this up. Don't act cocky and come off looking obnoxious. Why don't you try it? It's a great wine, at least taste it. Yes, ma'am. Ah, wine… Tastes like wine… - Hi, Eva. - Hi. What's Up? He wants more champagne. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you going to join us? Certainly not. - Okay, Ciao. - Ciao. It may be true that in emulating past generations, we evaded some laws. But a new era has arrived. It's my belief that my generation must reject such practices. I'm also aware there are suspicions concerning my inheritance. I am prepared to accept impartial judgment on this matter. You're so full of shit… It's my responsibility to accept both the burden and the glory of my position. As the CEO of this conglomerate, I've never shied away from this duty. He looks good. But still… We've been watched at our home, and after hiding in a hotel for days, now he's on national TV. Shouldn't you have done something? Our apologies. I thought someone would step up and take responsibility for this. I am terribly disappointed. This is why you'll always be salarymen. Our shame aside, his manner was impeccable today. It's not much of a blow to him. He's a winner. Enough. I set this up. - Hello, Robert. - Good morning, sir. Go. go! Why'd he come all the way here? His company must be in an uproar. Hi, Robert! I saw the news on the way. What the hell's going on? Don't worry. Everything is under my control. Let me just say one thing. If Chul is prosecuted for any reason the deal is over, nullified. Void, got it? It has nothing to do with our deal. No, nothing. Yes, Yoon Kyung-sun speaking. It's an honor to receive your call. We're watching it now. Thank you very much. My boy should be out before dinner. He said not to worry. Who was that? How do you say it in English? Just say, "a very, very important person". It's from very, very important person, you know? I think that's enough. Isn't that a partial admission of tax evasion? It is over. Please refer to our press release. Armand de Brignac. Courtesy of my grandfather. Grandfather… Thank you sir. My pleasure, Robert. Enjoy! What did the prosecutor say? Picking up a $200 billion company with $6 million from grandfather and not a cent out of my pocket… Pay a little bit of tax… Wouldn't work in the States, huh? Are you kidding? You'd go to jail for that. They're more understanding in Korea. The legal issues will be solved soon. I don't know, Chul. My company's pretty worried about this. Don't worry. It'll all get resolved. Know why? The law and the people in the law are all in his pocket. Think of the money politicians have taken from grandpa over the years. Not only that, he was robbed of his company, and humiliated. In this country, politicians, men in power, they are all third-rate gangsters. But Korea's improved a lot, hasn't it? Improved, my ass. Who knows what the future holds. Let's say we sell out to US financiers, because of succession problems. I'd get mountains of cash, but what about the company? Would it be run rationally? They'd skim off the cream, then the company would go bankrupt. Can you imagine Korea without us? Impossible. But if you do decide to sell, give me a first option. Your capital in the West wasn't earned legitimately either. It's all from colonization, the slave trade, exploitation of labor, and so on. Let's be honest here. You are perfectly right, madam. With enough time, I could've done the right thing here. I just need a decent partner among the political elite. The problem is, they're all hicks or grave robbers. That Robert… he's a fox. The best. Don't screw up this time. Grandpa is watching you. Could I give Young-jak a job to do? I'll tell you a shocker! You won't be happy to hear it! Because life is going great, not a stress in my life! You first! Then you. And you last. Rub it against me! I'm not a greedy person, but if you insist… Help yourself. Thank you, sir. - Done? - Yes, sir. Forget it. Let's go. Leaving so soon? Let's have some fun tonight, mister. I, uh… Sorry. I'm not at that level yet. Take care. How long have you worked for us? 10 years, sir. Someone like you should be doing real work. Not this sort of thing. I'm sorry. Sir, it's not a problem. They sure are busy. Just watch the movie. Father's back early too. I got something to take care of. If the chairman's not too tired, ask him to join us. Off you go. Daddy doesn't even say good night to me. Why'd you even fight for custody? Why not send them to their mother? Beautiful. Excellent. I shouldn't have seen that. I invested in a copper mine in Uzbekistan. Hit the jackpot. Big time. How big? Wanna join me? Set up a company With no connection to me, and list it on the stock market, okay? Can you do that? A slush fund? What for? Look into private banks in Geneva too. Who you gonna give it to? I'm sick of running around delivering bags of money. I want to solve everything in one shot. One big shot. A billion dollars, that's a lot of money. I didn't know you two were so close. We have to avoid the tabloids here, but in the US we met often. He's solid. And he got his father to agree? He couldn't accept so much without approval. Even if they take it, how could they help you so brazenly? So brazenly? Mom and Dad will be invited, eat dinner, pose for a photo… A short news story, and it's a done deal. Their underlings will figure it out. OK, let's do it. But it's a frightful deal. This could blow up in our faces. It's insane. This business has always been insane. If you're sane, you won't survive. It's the art of not being detected. Them? Who do you mean? The big guy? Linney! Mommy! You do miss mom? Do you have something to tell me? Dangerous, very dangerous. As long as you button your lips… I will be fine. Don't worry about that. I appreciate it. Anyway… you don't think you have a future with him, right? You think, I don't have a future with him? You don't know him more than I do. So, who raises your children in the Philippines? I have my own maid. I pay her a small amount of money though. My children are raised by Chinese-Korean lady. I got divorced too. It's fucking stupid… What about your husband? Drinking, beating, gambling, yelling, screwing around. You know Asian men, fucked up losers. What's 'fucked up loser' in Korean? - Uh… 'pathetic bum'? - Pathetic bum? 'Pathetic bum'? Thank you. Mr. Joo! Yes? I told you, I don't like you bowing to me. Thank you so much for today. You guys are looking good together. What a worthless scum! Your holiday is coming. You won't be going home? No. madam. My children are coming to visit me this time. Mr. Joo took care of everything: flights and hotels. Thank you so much, madam. Get some more coffee for Mr. Chairman? Certainly, madam. Sir, you went overboard… I am really in awe of your mother. How'd she find us out? Give it to the kids. I could tell a few days ago during breakfast. Gave me the chills. Was it you? Did you tattle on me? Dad, how could he have known about it? He knew it. Young-jak, you really shouldn't live that way. Mr. Chairman, I really didn't say a word. Why not? To protect us? Don't, or you'll get pulled in too. It's nice to gain her confidence, isn't it? That was the entirety of my role when I married into this family. I earned their confidence, received money and power. But in the end, this is it. - If you… - Daddy! Anyway, you're not to blame, you deserve your shot. The head of each subsidiary is just an economics graduate, who's given the role after delivering bags of money. I know you aspire to at least that much in your life. Nami, I'm so sorry. Sorry to me? You fuck my old father… and saying you are sorry to me? Hey, not in front of the kids. Dad, how could you cause us such trouble? It's not just mom, you know. My life's been nothing but trouble, ever since I met your mother. Nami. All I want is to live with my children. That's all. So it's true you knew about their affair? Mr. Chairman misunderstood what happened. I know, you're not the type to talk. And you wanted to protect Eva. Why not just send Eva back home and end this discreetly? There won't be any rumors. How dare she… What's with the hidden cam in dad's room? Who installed it? I don't trust your father. You should know very well why that's necessary. Drop it. Have a good night, then. Hold on a minute. I'm off. He must be tired, don't keep him long. Young-jak, is it fair that I'm so miserable? Please calm down… You know how exhausted I am, how frustrated I am, how lonely… Hold Still! Come on, baby! Slow… and deep! Deeper! Deeper, harder! Wretched old hag… I'm so refreshed! Feels great to sleep well for once. Madam. It's you. I'd like to resign. What happened last night, won't happen again. So let's pretend it didn't happen. In any case, I'm sorry. You young people get drunk and do it all the time. 'One-night stand', right? Isn't it the same? Is it because I'm so old? Is it so disgraceful to sleep with a granny like me? No, of course, it's not that… Sometimes old women want to do it, too. Anyway, I hear you. Later… Tough… Tough as nails… Did you rest well last night? Yeah… sure. You heard father's back? Yes. Could you go down first? What is it? Come in. Come in. It's alright, come in. Sit. Put the headphones on. Keep watching. You're the first one in here, besides me. How could you, with the girl who looks after my grandkids? And Eva too, how could she dare look me in the eye each day? No point in discussing her, it's Dad's fault. Remember that actress who killed herself a few years ago? Forced to provide sexual favors… I crossed paths with her a few times without realizing it. Remember how her suicide note swept the headlines? Though nothing came of it in the end… Why are you talking such nonsense? It shocked me to my core. She hated it more than death itself. I felt so guilty at that time. She could've been my daughter… She pretty much was. So, this is your repentance? To your mother, and to you, I've been such a terrible husband and father. So many women passed through my arms, but to them, I was just a piece of trash. Eva is my last woman. To her, for once in my life, I want to be a good man. I'm serious. At my age, what's there to be afraid of? I'll leave everything, and go with Eva. Father, what's with you? Just have a fling with her. Enough already! No one has more weak points than you. I'm filled with weak points. A single blow could finish me at any time. Soon enough, I'll be in diapers. Stop tormenting me, and let me go. Your father has charm, but he's made of different material from us. Not that again! Mom. That's troubled me the most. So what will you do? What can I do? I can't hold him back. What about the work father did for us? Young-jak can do it. You trust him that much? He's not proud enough to decline such an offer. He'll follow orders and won't betray us. Let's groom him and see how high he rises. You're still here? It's been a hard day. So, You have anything else to say? No, madam. Alright, do your best from here on. Off you go. - Where's dad? - Why do you ask? I'm tired, leave me alone. Mr. Joo. Come in. He's packing downstairs. Where is he going? It'll create problems if he goes abroad. I'll look into it, madam. What about father, will it be okay? What about him? I wonder if we can trust him. He's your father. Even if he's done with me. And you're still his son. Nami… Go back to the company. Maintain your ground for now. Okay. I spent decades in this place. But nothing here feels like it belongs to me. Dad… What made you want to marry Mom in the first place? Money… It was the money. But if your anguish drove you to booze and endless women, why not divorce her? I was addicted to money. Scared to cut off the flow. That's simple. Money. I spent heaps of money. But it just left me with contempt. Huh? Contempt! Contempt! Dad, I think I didn't know you. I'm sorry. I'm the one who's sorry. Bastard! Now that I finally understand my father and what he's been through… Mr. Joo. What's with you? You've changed, you know that? Have I done something wrong? Of course not. Then speak your mind, it's okay! Why can't you open up? Please call if you need me. Why a travel ban all of a sudden? Can the prosecutor do this without any warrant? I have a right to freedom of travel. Fine, then. Something comes up. I have to fix it. You go with your children. I go later. Honey, will you and your brother be able to fly alone? Don't worry, Mom. I couldn't leave without you. Worrying about you, waiting for you. Just drive me crazy. I will take you with me. You don't believe me? I do. But I'm so afraid of your wife. Oh my wife, that witch! Kiss me. How old are you anyway? Since long time ago I don't count, but old, old enough. That's good enough. Impossible. That's impossible. Thirty years ago, he was fucking around so much, I dragged him to the hospital to tie up his tubes. A vasectomy? Thanks to that, we have no bastard children to deal with. Mr. Joo, what happened? I personally met the nurse in charge. She confirmed Eva's pregnancy. Then, a Filipino half-sibling? Where are they now? The hotel? They disappeared without checking out. I'm going to destroy them… You should be proud of yourself. What about the rest? We need some time to launder it. Full payment will be done before the work is done. Wow, look at that! So barbaric! That's the result of our deal. We could've let them work at our factory, so they could pay monthly mortgage for their Korean cheap apartments. That's their entitlement to the middle-class. We fucked it up, right? What a lofty idea, Chul. Honestly, your country's elite, you and your parents included, you spend money like you're fucking insane. Whether it's your own capital, or public funds… You burn through piles of cash like it's nothing. You're all going to go bust. Look who's talking. Fuck you! How are you doing, Mr. Joo? Your role grows more and more crucial for the company. Not bad. How are you doing in Korea, Mr. Altman? The money is easy, the fucking is great. Korea is a fantastic country. Good for you… The cash will arrive in Geneva, I need the son there. We'll sign together. Then, everyone's good and ready to go. Good. Dad! Long time no see! Your mother put a travel ban on me. If you keep this up, you know you'll hurt me too. You selfish bastard. Lift the travel ban, got it? Hey, hey! Come here. Honey, I thought we agreed not to torment each other anymore. Come back home with Eva. Let's talk this over. With Eva? What's there to talk about? Don't smirk. Keep this up, and you'll die alone on the streets. I'll make it happen. Let's go. Hey! Contempt! We've completed this deal, but I'm saddened for the families of those laid off. I feel deeply responsible for it. We must work hard to bring them back to work quickly. Move aside. It's our social responsibility to… Mr. Yoon, I'm prosecutor Han and this is a warrant for your arrest. It's the prosecutor's office. Read it. You're in violation of the APL on Specific Crimes. Looks like you're back in cuffs. They burst into the office and your home. I wiped everything clean. This means war. Father. Mr. Altman, Madam Baek, I hear you have something cooking in Uzbekistan too? I'll have to dig into it, see what comes out. She's cute. What was your job title before marriage? Come back to the company. Yes, mother. So where is your husband? Don't know, he said he didn't want to live with me. He's nowhere to be found. You should've kept a tighter leash on him! Isn't that right? Eva… Eva… didn't even say good bye. Find Eva! My dear Eva! If you'd be generous, and grant your husband's wishes, couldn't this all be easily resolved? How could you suggest that? That won't happen! Got it?! There. Okay, good work. Eva! Bye, I will be back! Here comes the target. What are they doing? Aren't we here for Chairman Yoon? What do you think you're doing?! I'm not some gangster's underling! You're a salaryman, and so am I. This is terrible. Keum-ok, what did you do?! What is this? Turn on the lights! Eva! Eva! Dad! Get in! My Fault. My Fault. This is all my fault… Young-jak! Don't touch her until the cops show up. Honey, I'm so happy you're back. Chul is still locked up. I'm sorry it turned out this way. Rest easy for now, we'll take care of everything else. You're pretty amazing, mother. Watch your mouth. How will you repent for this? I said watch your mouth! This is from old man. Take it. What for? Rewarding me for what I did to Eva? I know how you feel. But money makes it all better. Get out. You remember my nanny, who killed herself when I was a kid? What? She burned herself… How could you remember her? You were so little. I think about her sometimes. For someone so kind, why'd she think that was the only way out? She was insane. Mom, we can't treat such people this way. Who are we to judge them? Drop the tacky sentiment! Eva's dead! Can't you see that? Eva came to say goodbye to grandpa and drowned while swimming. - What's with you? - Mother! Are you implying I hired someone to have her killed? Unthinkable! And is there any special reason why she has to live? Mr. Joo, please come with us. He's a tough one. Don't fuck around, and keep your head down, huh? Cut him loose. Can money compensate for death? So did they buy you off? You won't understand. I grew up in this family. How could I not? The way Eva died… I just went through the same thing. Who was it? Who could've done this? They're possessed by money and power. They're beside themselves. But even then, they can't just do whatever they want. I can't let them! Of course we can't. So help me. They are super rich. So lording it over everyone else like kings. Absurd! That's a danger. My Ex seldom did it to me during marriage. Son of a bitch had no interest in me. The way he acted was exactly like my brother. Not once after the divorce, either. When I first saw you, I thought, "I want to sleep with this guy". You knew, didn't you? Yeah. Wait… do we really have to do it at a time like this? Why not? All right, we'll drop it for today. But another time for sure, okay? Okay. Sharing a bed platonically? This is nonsense! The chairman is back. He'll resolve everything. "Resolve"? What do you mean by that? Chul will be freed soon, without a charge. You sure? Yep. So, don't even think about pulling out, that will put us more in danger. Chul is the one putting us in danger. Indeed. Eva… Go ahead as planned, the Geneva thing. This is urgent! No. It's too risky. You chicken shit! Do as I say, you'll find a way out of this mess. You scheming fox! It's your grandfather's will. Mom! Stop whining. Linney! Dad! What is this? It's too late. This?… it's suicide. My declaration of defeat. I lost. I haven't done a damn thing right in my life. What a wasted life. What happened to Eva was the worst. I feel so awful. What do you think should be done? Ah, Madam Baek. My darling Keum-ok! A great business woman, who gained power by lining up young girls to satisfy her old father. Honey! Don't come closer. I don't like you. Son! How could you? Ah! My father-in-law! Who loves this world so much, he refuses to leave. I wanted to see how long it'd take for you to die. My apologies, I'm going first. Father, I'm so sorry. Keum-ok, I feel sorry for you. How can you live with yourself? That poor thing… There won't be any autopsy. It was obviously an accidental drowning. Welcome back to the free world. What happened? Dad took the blame for everything. He's at the hospital, doesn't look good. He is the best father anyone could ever have. Sis, I heard you got promoted. President, no less. Even in prison, you hear everything. Why? You nervous? And I heard you're fucking this man in front of me. Watch who you're talking to! You stop fucking around with actresses, and go see your kids for once! I'll just say one thing about him. He's gotten this far by fucking our old mother! Get out! Mr. Joo, I apologize. I think I was out of line. Hey, calm down. No violence! We have to be reasonable. Get out! I'll apologize once more. Enough. Stop! Stop already! Time out! Stop it! Hey! Don't you people know better? You, fucked up loser. Get in! Why don't you show me some respect! Drop the act. I'm not some bimbo who falls for rich guys who can fight. Come on, get UP! It's true. What is? I fucked your mother! Oh my god. Thank you for everything. That's enough! It's all over! Since you'll need it, even in death. Suddenly, my husband Yoon Kyung-sun has left us. This is so hard for me to believe. I remember when I first met him as a young girl. He was a stunning, charming young man. Delightful, spontaneous and handsome… Anyway, he was a very special person. I was madly in love. With these nice artworks… But he suffered so much after marrying me. He took up jobs not suited for him. But to the end, he wanted to live in style. Unfortunately, this is how it ended. I guess it can't be helped. I can do nothing but accept his death as is. Darling, I loved you. My husband loved this song. Let's listen together. Rest in peace now… Please accept my condolences. Thank you. Ride first class to Paris and take a rest. The penthouse suite at Montalembert is cute. If you feel stifled, go to the sea. Take a month off, then I'll transfer you to the head office. No, thank you. I'll formally refuse any more contempt. - Don't act up again. - Chul. Young-jak. What could you possibly do after leaving me? After leaving you? I could breathe again. I'm on the brink of suffocating here. You don't feel it, do you? I heard you're dating Nami. Why is that your concern? I'm sure you know what you're doing. Mother. It looks like we both slept with Young-jak then. As mother and daughter, are we really okay? Is this morally right? Bunch of idiots! Oh my god! I'll leave you two to talk it over. You've been alone, you should understand. All my life I lived this way, because of him. Can you understand what I did in that light? Aside from your woman's body, you're just like this family's licentious men! Must you be this way too, Nami? Please don't. Why? Because you control the money? Sweetie. I'm really sorry about Young-jak. But even I have a private life, And I don't want to discuss this in front of your father. Go. You never loved any of us. You only loved yourself and grandpa's money. Go! This is all your fault! What will you do now? Huh? What?! What will you do now! I want it back! I want it back, you bastard! I want my life back! I want it back! Hey, Ms. I know you're tough, but you're headed for prison. Careful, you piece of shit. Mr. Joo! I'm just a housemaid. You and I are the same. It's unfair to threaten a powerless maid this way. Hey. maid! I know you've got major dirt on my mother and grandfather, but how about I come after you? You're done for. - But madam… - Maid! Shut your mouth and leave. Yes, madam. You're a good person, and sweet. How glad you see me that way. I am really a fucked up loser. Please, don't be. Sure. I need to go, got one last thing to do. Okay, fine. But hold me tightly just once. Excuse me, could I swap my first class seat with you? Why? What the…! You're stalking me now? It was simple deduction, not stalking. I did some other research too. You and my mother… They say it was… something along the lines of rape. And you're not the first of her victims. So I should be the one ashamed for having a mother like that. - Wait! - Huh? Let's do it with it on. Just twist it in from the side. Like this? Yeah, that's it. Here? Yeah! Hi. You guys speak English? How can I explain this? I understand some. Good. We've met before at the beach in Korea. Remember? When we went to Korea, we camped on the beach. I wanna see mama. It's the people we met there. I wanna see mama. He wants to see mama. Is this mama? Mama inside? Open. I want to see my mama! Open! Mama! THE TASTE OF MONEY
