'He is the one who did it. Hi is a real scoundrel.' What are you saying? Nepal? Anyway, look... You and I haven't done anything. Hey, did you? - Huh! Yesterday, I was at the hospital the entire day with my mother. Chandan and Jagai have not got their weapons yet. Now, do you understand who did the job? - Oh, hell! Nepal... He took the entire credit alone. He has cemented his place in Brother's eyes after doing this job. Do you get it. - Oh, sh*t! The scoundrel thinks he is too smart, isn't it? Fine. We worked together for so long and now he is... - Hey! Hey, don't lose your temper. - Yeah, yeah. Give me another drink. - Yeah, yeah. Take it. Hey, Bikash, when will your girl come? She will come.

Please, send a senior officer to investigate the issue immediately? I have given my word to Mr. Adrish that, someone from the special branch will visit the site in a day or two. Sir, it is impossible to send someone in a day or two. Why? There is the IPL. The President is visiting, next week. Oh, God! - Who should I send, Sir? All the senior officers are busy. Oh. Hey, buddy, at least, arrange for a routine enquiry. Okay, sir. I'll see. Yeah, tell me? There should not be any investigation in Raghunathpur. The investigation is bound to happen. We have orders from the higher authorities. However, you needn't worry. I will send a guy, who will not cause any trouble for you. - Okay. You just ask the local station in charge, to keep the report ready. 'Chotka, look this is father, me and mom.' 'Look here; this is grandpa and this is you.' Hey, is that me? Do I have hair like that? 'Yes, yes, you have hair like that.' 'Listen, that is not me, that is your father.' 'Your head! This is my father.' 'Can't you see, he has a paunch.' Wow, what a paunchy! 'Mom! Mom! Mom, what happens?' - Titli! 'Mom, why aren't you saying anything?' - Titli! Titli! 'Wake up, mom!' - Sister-in-law? Hey! Hey! You bast**d! - 'Mom, wake up!' May, I come in? Hey, Gachi. Yes, tell me, sir. Whatever has to be done, I will do it. There won't be an investigation. Five years... Just five years... This Sushil has come to power. And he has started thinking of himself as the Lord of Raghunathpur village. He has forgotten, that I was in power for thirty years before this. I was in power. And even today, the Lord of this Raghunathpur village is, Bhagirath Misra. Yes, sir. When I see you, I feel empowered in my heart. But Sir, this is... I mean... This is the DM's order. What can I do? You will do it. You are the one who will do it. Those murders that happened, you will write the reports for those. And the man who comes here from Lal Bazaar, hand the report to him. he will take the report and leave. Period. But? - I have spoken to the higher authorities. Oh, then it is alright. This is just a routine enquiry. You will go there... The local officer will give you the reports... You will collect them and come back. Anyone can do that. Spare me, sir. Please. Thank you. Anyway, I have not been on the field for a year now. Besides, mentally, I am not at all... - One minute. Look, Abhuro, I know. The things that have happened in your life during the past year... You haven't been able to come out of the trauma, yet. But, for how long will you stay in a dark room, like this? You are not visiting the police training centre regularly. Why? Please, Abhuro. Why? What is the reason? I have told you everything. At this moment there is no one, whom I can trust with this job. Okay. Since you have made up your mind not to go, then... I better leave.

What nonsense are you talking? How many heads do I have on my shoulders? Hey, Gurupada. - Yeah? Ah, where is Naren. Your Naren called to inform us. He said that he has orders from his boss, so he seized the truck. What? My orders? Hey, he lied to you. Don't you get it? All lies! No, it is the truth. Who are you, buddy? Abhurojit Dutta. Lal Bazaar, Special branch. Tell me, sir. Who is this man? - Huh. Why would you want to know that, Sir? Your file is ready. Please, sit down. And what about today's case?

And you? - Ayesha. It's an order Mr. Bairagi. And I... What is your name? Yes, sir? - What's going on, Abhuro? Instead of doing the work you were sent for, what are you doing? Sir, ten minor girls were being trafficked. Caught red-handed. Should I let them go? Okay. Let the local police handle that. You don't get involved with all this. I did not want to get into anything, Sir. I did, because you forced me to. And now that I am involved, I will not let go so easily. I will send these ten minor girls, home. I will look into the matter. You focus on your work. Where are you now? At the Raghunathpur police station, Sir. Give the phone to the OC. - Yes, Sir. Hmm. Talk to sir. Hello? Yes, sir. Yes. Tell me.

You got your chance to treat your guest. Meaning? Hey, why are you so surprised? I will have to take the report for this murder as well. So, I have no option but to accept your hospitality, tonight. Hey, Gurupada. Call them at the guest house and inform them that Sir will stay here tonight. Okay, I'll talk to them right away. And Mr. Paritosh. Please arrange to send the body for the post-mortem. In the meanwhile I will complete another work. Other work? What other work do you have here? Oh, dear! I am not under an obligation to tell you that. But of course, you will find out. Hello. Nanda. Clean up one of the rooms. Already we have no respite and now this new trouble. Sir, I have informed them. - You have obliged us. Will you bring him down or should I do it? No, no, no. Go, you all go ahead. - Come on. Go. Come on, come on, come on. - Let's go. All sorts of headache! - Who will climb the tree? Hey, Remu. - There, Daub is here. Hey, did you call for me? - Go. Hey, ask him to come here. - Go. No, no, no, no. - Eat a little now. Have a few bites. - I will not eat. I won't eat. I won't eat. I won't eat. - Mother, just one bite. I won't eat. I won't eat. - Mother, open your mouth. No, I won't eat. - Mother, a little. A little, mother. Just once. A little. - No, I won't eat. I won't eat. Mm... Mm. Mother, open your mouth. Some more. She is here. She is home. Hurry up, go and open the door. Bring her in. It's raining, she will get drenched. - Yes. Go, hurry up! Go. - Yes, I am going. Go quickly. It's raining; she will get wet. Yes, I am going. Go quickly. Bring her in quickly. Right now. Let me hurry up and... Cover my head. Otherwise, I will get wet in the rain. Is everything done there? Yes. Do you know? I saw a new officer has come here. He looks like he has come from Kolkata. Did they ask you any specific questions? He was asking about you. I told him, you were in a hurry. Hey, are you home? Come, come to me. - Did she eat? Go and feed her the rest. - Yes, I'll go in. Again? Another murder? Three murders in one week. Who knows what is happening here? You are leading by two - one. What do you mean? What are you trying to say? Very simple. Gobindo Singh was your man. Bikash Saha and, Gophe. - Yes, Gophe. are Bhagirath Misra's men. You have lost one, they have lost two. You are making a mistake, officer. I do not believe in revenge politics. Our seven generations have lived here. That Bhaigrath's father, Shankar Misra... Was exploiting people year on year. Had you come to this Raghunathpur five years ago, then you wouldn't have recognised this place. You could not have set foot in this village. Despite their efforts, last time, they could not defeat me. The local people came together and responded to their atrocities. Actually, Shankar could not imagine that he would lose. The day election results were declared, he died of a heart attack. I thought, good riddance to bad pestilence. But Bhagirath is his father's son! He is using his father's secret sources to bother us again. Hey, mister, I am the local Panchayat Pradhan. The local police... Kolkata police... Are in their hands. This woman trafficking... Black-marketing of medicines... And the real estate business... They do all this openly. They attacked me some time back. Who knows what will they do tomorrow? You... You... Do you know that I... I have kept my sons underground because I fear them. And you are insinuating that I am doing all this? I understand everything. Then you tell me, who is committing these murders? Look, the fact that Nepal has killed Gobindo, That is something his own people are bragging about. And if they have committed the other two murders also, I won't be too surprised. You say it is a fight for business? Bang on. Hey, Bhagirath runs a syndicate of all his businesses here. They are probably fighting amongst themselves. And they are spreading rumours that I am getting all this done! Bloody! Sushil killed two of my boys. Do we have to sit like cowards just because the elections are around the corner? Hey, Nepal! - Huh? I want one of his men in the next twenty-four hours. Period. Gahur, Swapan, Kajol, Uday... All of them are underground, brother. None of them could have done it. Hey, then who is committing these murders? My father? - Huh! Is there a traitor in our group? "What are you looking for? What do you understand?" "You will vanish if I as much as bat an eyelid." "Come with me on this intoxicating night." "I will cry on your shoulders." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "If you find out everything." "You will fall into my love trap..." "Today I'll expose everything..." "If you find out everything. You will fall into my love trap..." "Today I'll expose everything..." "Come with me on this intoxicating night." "Come with me on this intoxicating night." "I will cry on your shoulders." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." Who is calling? - Darn! Huh, one second. Hello? Hey, who is that? Greetings, Mr. Naren. Abhurojit Dutta, here. Sir. Sorry, sir. Where are you at the moment? At home. Sir, I am at home. I am standing outside your house. Please, come out. I want to talk to you. No, I mean, Sir. I am not in my own house. I mean... Ahem... Actually... - Let it be. I have a question? - Huh, yes, Sir. Where is the post-mortem of the bodies done? Ahem... Sir, at the Sadar hospital. What is the name of the doctor? Esha madam, sir. I mean... Dr Esha Chakraborty. Thank you. Goodnight. Yes, yes, sir. Goodnight. Where were you last night? I mean sir... That... Sir, her name is Shiuli. What does she do? What happened? Why are you quiet? Is she a school girl? Hey, hey! No, no. Sir, she sings and dances at the bar. So, why the hesitation? Are you in love, or do you just spend time with her? I love her, sir. I mean... You know? So. I thought I saw your signature on Gobindo and Bikash's reports? Yes, sir. I made the reports. - Did you visit the crime scene? No, Sir. I wrote whatever Mr. Paritosh asked me to write. Great. The day you get into trouble, your Mr. Paritosh will disassociate himself with you. Brother, you egg toast is ready. Please, take it. Sir, Esha madam is here. Madam. Sir. Madam, sir has come from Kolkata. - How much for the tea? What is this sir? - No, I won't take money, Sir. Sir, sir! Sir, I have a setting with Montu. Yes, sir. - You don't have to pay him. Why are you gaping? How much do I have to pay? Tell me? Ah, thirty-four rupees. You will probably take some time. Didi you talk to them... I'll go inside. - Take it. I'll come back and take the change. Sure, sir. Why are you staring at him? Hereafter, your setting with him ends. You draw up the account; I'll go and come back from the hospital... There, he is coming. I better go. Greetings. I am Abhurojit Dutta. I am from Kolkata. Lal Bazaar, Special Branch. Greetings. I am Dr Esha Chakraborty. What is the matter? Tell me? Actually, the three murders that took place here, I wanted to ask you a few questions regarding those. Oh, okay. Please, come inside. Come. You came yesterday, isn't it? And you did a great job the minute you came here. What do you mean? Had it not been for you? Who would have rescued so many girls? At least, someone registered a protest. Thank you. Come in. Here. come in. - Come, Sir. Tell me. What do you want to know? You prepared the report for Gobindo Singh and Bikash Saha. I mean the post-mortem report. - Hmm. Can you tell me what are your exact observations? Both died out of stab wounds however, the spots were different. But killer knows one thing very well, exactly where and in which spot to attack, so that the person will die at once. How can you say that? Of course, by noting the exact positions of the stab wounds. I suspect Gophe was also, stabbed first, and then hung on the tree. It's possible. But I cannot say anything unless I check the body. I will check the body in a while. Then I will inform you. Okay. So, you were the first one to see the body hanging on the tree? Can you tell me the exact course of events? Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait. So strange. - Didi. Look at that. 'What was the time?' 5 Pm or 5:30 PM. Do you pass through that way, every day? That depends upon the work pressure here. Okay... At that time mother... I mean your mother... Who gives her the medicine? Deepa. Deepa goes and gives the medicine to my mother. Is Deepa your sister? No, she is the school master's adopted daughter. She is like my sister. Who is the Master? - Keshav Chakraborty. He runs a primary school here. So everyone calls him the Master. I see. Don't you have any other family members? Me and my mother? Is there anything else you want to know? I am really sorry. I was just doing my duty. Anyway. See you. Let's go. By the way, the guy who died yesterday? What is... Gophe, sir. Gophe. - Yes. By when will his PM report be ready? It will take one day. You will get it in the morning tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Tell me. Get me the reports for bed number five. Okay, ma'am. I'll get it. Let me see the list. Here it is, sir. Seventeen hundred and ninety rupees. Pay him, Naren. - Sir, what I was saying is, Let it be. I don't want the money, Sir. Why are you gaping? Pay him. This is all I have, sir. Sorry, sir. Let me see. Take this. - Heh, heh. Thank you, Sir. Thank you. Hereafter, don't give him anything on credit. Okay. - Let's go. After this, if I see you eating for free? No, sir. Sorry, sir. - 'Come and have hot tea and snacks.' Do you have Gophe's address? Yes, sir. Let's go. - Sure. Hey, stop. Stop. What's wrong, sir? What is hidden at night comes out clearly during the day. Have you found something, sir? Nothing. Let's go. Hey, get up! Get up from here. Why did you not throw this last time? I did. Why did you cover Rohan's card? This idiot doesn't know how to play. - I gave it first. Do you know how to play? Do you know how to play 29? Hey! Scoundrels! Is this house the centre of entertainment? Gophe died last night and none of you cares tuppence. Come on, let's play. Don't bother. Play. Hey, pick up the card. Pick it up. Hey, you pick it up. I'll hit you if you make a mistake this time. Idiot! Play properly. This way, sir. Please, come. Come. Anyone at home? Are you sure about what you are saying? Hundred per cent. Who is it? Shanu. Are you sure? Shanu called Gophe last evening and asked him to come to the Gazipur jungle. Is your mother home? Please, call your mother. Who do you want to see? Don't be afraid. Sir, has a few questions for you. Oh? Come in. Come inside. Queen? Let's see whether you have it in you? Knight. Knight! He dropped a knight. - Hey, wait. What knight? - Wait. Wait. Wait. Pick up the card. Look at this. Where were you last evening, Shanu? What do you mean by where was I? What is it to you? Did you or didn't you call Gophe yesterday and ask him to come to the Gazipur jungle? Rubbish. Hey! Scoundrel! Get up! I want a straight answer to a straight question. Did you or didn't you murder him? Someone called him around 4 PM. He became restless after receiving the call. I have seen this restlessness in him for the past twelve years. I am sure it was a woman. She is deaf. She cannot hear. He was not a very good character man. I used to tell him that our daughter is growing up, and he should mend his ways. But he never listened to me. Finally, a woman caused his death. Who called him? I am not sure. But he said he had work with Shanu. I don't know if it is the truth or not. Yes, I called him. I called and told him to pick up the girl and bring her to the club. Because brother called me and asked me to come. I asked him to do it as I couldn't go. You are lying. Lies? Am I lying? You have a phone. Call him. Make a call to brother. Call and ask him if I was there till 6 PM yesterday? Do it. Call him! Give me the name of the girl. Tell me her name. What is her name? - Mahua. Gophe had a soft corner for girls. His wife said that he was not of a very good character. On the other hand, Shanu called Gophe. So, did Shanu murder Gophe? The girl was a bait. But Sir, Shanu da and Gophe da, I mean, Shanu and Gophe were friends. That means he is also a womaniser. Who supplies the girls here? Sir, there is a slum on the outskirts of the village. A red light area. Just beyond the lake. What happened, sir? - It seems you frequent that place? I used to go there. But not anymore. Why? That is where I rescued Shiuli from there, Sir. Shiuli? Oh, yes! The one you stayed the night with, yesterday. Yes. Anyway. Come, let's take a tour of that red light area. Let's go. Yes, sir. - When will you come back? Sir, I am still in Raghunathpur. Meaning? Why are you still there? What? Haven't you heard? There was another murder here last evening. What? The minute I was about to leave with the previous two reports, when I got the third news. So, I had to stay back. Don't you know? I thought the news must have reached you by now? Hopeless. Anyway, when will you come back? I will get the PM report tomorrow, and then I will leave, Sir. Okay. Where are you at the moment? I met a student from the training centre here. Now he is the SI of the local police station. I am touring the area with him. Take a tour; however, don't get in too deep. Understand? I got it, Sir. See you, then. Okay, see you. What is the matter, sir? Will Shiuli be at home now? Yes, she will be at home. But won't you go to that slum? We will go later. Let's go. Come on. Hey, wait. Padda di. Hey, Padda di. Who is that? Oh, my! Nepal Kumar. Madan Kumar. What's the matter? What brings you here after so long? Is your phone talk time over? Hey, stop your nonsense. Call Mahua. - Hmm! Not possible. She is with someone. If you act smart, I will walk into the room. Would you like that? - Huh! Hey, Madan. Let's go in. Hey! Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? Why are you losing your temper? At least, tell me what happened? Hey, don't irritate me. Just call Mahua. I have a few questions for her. Once she answers them, we will leave. Hey, Jhumur. Call Mahua. Unnecessarily trouble early in the morning! For how long have you been here? About three months. Nepal, Madan, Gophe, Shanu and Bikash. Do you know them? Who doesn't know them? No, I mean, are you acquainted with them just the way others are? No, Sir. She wasn't there for long. At the most, three months. The scoundrel Bikash died. He deserved it! A**h*le! A scum from hell! Why? What did Bikash do to you? I used to call him uncle. Bloody, scoundrel! He sold me to Padda di from fifty thousand rupees. Don't you have any family? I had, once. My father! He asked me to go with Bikash uncle. He said that uncle will give me employment. Later on, I found out, that my father also, took twenty-five thousand rupees. What's that? You have never said these things to me? Have you cared for anything but my body, ever? You all are the same. Where is your father, now? He is dead. He was punished for his sin. Serves him right. What is your father's name? Gobindo Singh. Where were you last evening? Why don't you call your friend and ask him? Shanu da was the one who called me. Do you know, auntie? I stood at the check post since 5 PM, not even a fly came by! I am glad you came. Give me my money. Give it. Give it. Give it. What happened? Didn't Gophe come to you? Hey, had he come then there wouldn't have been an issue. And if you don't trust my word, call Gophe and ask him Whether he visited me or not? Gophe was murdered last night. What is this? - Somebody killed him? His body was found in the Gazipur jungle. What? Really? I get the drift about Bikash and Gobindo. Why did you kill Gophe? What had he done to you? Me? I killed them? What are you saying, Sir? If I could do it? I would have killed them long ago and gone to jail. Shiuli doesn't have the courage, sir. Yes, sir. Shiuli hasn't done this. She was with me last evening. An interested witness is no witness! Anyway. At which bar do you dance? Paradise Bar. Everyday? - No. Friday, Saturday and Sunday. That means you will perform tomorrow? Yes. I'll come and see you dance before I leave. Stay well. See you. Huh! Sir. Tell me? I know you are telling the truth. Stay well. Master. Hey, Master. Master. What is the matter? Why are you all here, all of a sudden? Why? I have come here to get my girls. Oh, that is a police matter. Mr. Naren dropped them here. I am aware. And that is why I have brought someone with me. Hey! Come out. Come on. There you are. Your Naren's boss. Tell him. Master, for how long will you feed them? Now, let them go. Did you hear that? Have you received your order? Now, send them out. Hey, Nepal. Go. Go. So, sister... Where are they? Tell me? I will bring them out. Where are you going? You stay here. I will go and fetch them. Tell me. Bhagirath and Paritosh are here. - Hmm? To take those girls. What are you saying? - Yes. Do you have Amr Abhuro's number? No... I mean... I... I'll just check. Listen, we cannot allow this to happen. But who will look after auntie. She is sleeping. You disconnect the call now. Hey, what is the matter, sister? - Huh? Hurry up, please. Hey, sister! - Huh. It is very late, you go home, now. Okay, sir. Or will you go to Shiuli's house? Okay... You brought Shiuli from the red light area? You eat free at the tea kiosk and take bribes... Do you feel ashamed? At least, once in a while? I am telling you this as an elder brother. Listen to me carefully. After doing ten good things if you do one bad deed, then the people will only remember the bad deed. Not the good work you have done. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Oh, yes. Once the PM report is ready tomorrow... Release Gophe's body. And keep an eye on his family. Okay, sir. - Hmm. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Mr. Abhuro... Mr. Naren... Let's see. Oh, Mr. Abhuro. - What is the matter? Why are you here at this hour? Hurry up and come with me. They have come to pick the girls up from school. What? - Come, come, come. Move it. Move it. Move it. Hey, Nepal, hurry up. - Come on. Move it! There will be trouble if the cop from Kolkata comes here. Are you trying to scare me? I am not scaring you. I am scared. As you know, the cage is tiny. What is this? There were ten. They are only nine? What do you mean? What is the matter? Why are there nine girls? Where is the other girl? - What do you mean? All of them are here. All of them? Hey, move aside! He is disturbing me when I am at work! Let me go! I say, let me go! Leave me. - Come on, come on, little girl. Come on, come on, little girl. - Let me go! let me go! Hey, hurry up! - Let me go! Don't cry! Hey, put her in the van. Come on, move it. Deepa. - Didi? Naren, take the girls and go inside. One minute. One minute. Mr. Lalbazaar. I am sure by now; you know that father's also have fathers. So, why are you doing all this unnecessarily? Mr. Paritosh, you have no idea about the consequences. Listen, please, do your own work. You don't have the permission to interfere in this matter. Mr. Misra, you go ahead. - Yeah. Sir, we noted down the names and addresses of the girls in the police register. You will unnecessarily get into trouble. Hey, where were you since this morning? I looked but I could not find the register? Where have you kept it? Look for it in the morning. Hey. - Huh! Huh! Remove your hand from the child's mouth. Remove your hand from the child's mouth. You all go inside. One minute. One minute. Hero? Hello. What's going on here? Huh? You said he is your man? This scoundrel is causing trouble for me. Here, talk to him. Here. Talk. Yes, sir? - Abhuro. Just leave the place now. But sir? - The task I send you there for, you will only do that. Tomorrow morning collect the report for the third murder, come back to Kolkata. It's an order. Understand? - Yes, Sir. You look very frustrated. You feel like throwing the phone. Throw it. No problem. I was anyway planning to buy a new phone. Throw it. Thank you. Hey, Nepal. - Yeah. Hurry up! Hurry up! Put the girls in the van. - Yeah, yeah. Hey, come on. Move it. Hey. Come on, come on, get into the van. - We have to go home? Get in, get in, get in. - Yeah, yeah, it's already very late. And doctor madam's mother is also unwell. You also have to go home, right? Go, go, go on. No problem. See you, master. Hey, Paritosh. Let's go. Hey, hey. Hurry up. Sit. Sit. - Take a headcount. Take a head count. Come on, move it. 'Abhuro, just leave the place now.' 'I am sure by now, you know that father's also have fathers.' 'Let me go!' 'Abu wait! Abu!' 'Abu stop!' 'Abu!' 'Abu! Huh!' 'For how long...' 'For how long will you keep me in the jail, officer?' 'Shoot him! Don't spare him. Don't let him go, Sir!' 'The law will punish you.' 'Hey, hey, officer. Kill me.' 'Otherwise, I will make life hell for you.' Hello? Who is calling? Oh, yes. Tell me? What is the matter at this time of the night? What? What is the matter? Why are you here? The way you drove off, I was a bit worried about you. Anyway, you go and rest. It is quite late. I will take your leave. Sorry. Why are you saying sorry? I saw what happened. What is the ability of the police? That the power is so limited, I have had proof of that before, and today I realised it again. If you are in this condition, then how can an ordinary man trust the law? Can you tell me? For all these years, Bhagirath Misra and his men have committed so many atrocities. But everyone's hands are tied. Neither police, nor the government. Anyway. I have prepared the PM report for Gopeshwar Pramanik. I will send it to you at the first hour. By the way, your guess was correct. He was stabbed first, and hanged later. There is no point in worrying so much. You will leave tomorrow. And then things will go back to being as they were. Mr. Paritosh, will serve Bhagirath Misra. And the others will die in gang fights. However, if they all die one by one in these gang wars, it will be a good situation at the end. Are you sure that they are dying in a gang fight? Do you think it is something else? In these murders I, smell a planned pattern. Can you tell me who is committing these murders? The time to reveal that hasn't come yet. And I may not get that time. Because, I will have to go back tomorrow. I'll take your leave. Esha. I hope we will not meet again. What is it? Why aren't you eating? I am not feeling good. Oh, my! What's wrong with you? Haven't you seen all this in Raghunathpur before? I am feeling bad for sir. The man was humiliated and had to leave. And I could not do a thing. Nothing. What could you have done? Besides, if he stays here, you will be at a loss. You won't be able to have free tea and snacks at Montu's shop. You won't be able to seek bribes. I don't want to do all this. I don't want to! I want to be a good police officer like Sir. And when that Bhagirath, Nepal, and Madan... When I have to bow my head in front of these people... At those times, I think why I should be good and for whom? Today they picked up ten girls under sir's nose. I felt like shooting all of them right there. Do you know Shiuli? That little girl, was looking at my eyes with grief. And I... I could not do anything. Nothing. Don't cry, Naren. The way, you rescued me... One day, you will also rescue them. I won't be able to do it, Shiuli. I can't do it. Sir will leave tomorrow. Then who will support me, tell me? - Why? I am there for you. Doctor madam is here. The Master is here. The entire Raghunathpur is there to support you. You make an effort, at least. You are right, Shiuli. From tomorrow I will be a different Naren. Oh! Wow! My sweetheart! You were taunting me in the morning. Apparently, I don't care for anything but your body! Hey, should I tell you the truth? Tell me. Today, I really feel like falling in love with you. Trust me. Really? Hey, come, come, Sir. Last night, you went off in a huff. I thought you have driven back to Kolkata. Is Gophe's PM report here? Yes, Esha madam sent the report. This is the file. You do one thing. Please, sign here. Another one here. Thank you. This is your file. Travel safe! Naren. - Yes, Sir. Show sir the sightseeing places, in and around this village. Because he could not do much in the past two days. No, I mean... You will never be able to come here. So I was saying... See you. Good riddance! Hello. - Sir. Remember my advice to you. You have my phone number. Call me if you need something. - Yes, Sir. Oh, yes. Look after Shiuli and yourself. Stay well, sir. - hey. Take care. - Huh. Sir! Sir, Mr. Paritosh is asking you to come inside for a bit. Sir. - There you are. You know the tricks of the trade. So, why this drama of leaving? You could have told me before. I unnecessarily made you sign? What has happened? Tell me? The way you are pretending as though you know nothing? We have received an order from the higher-ups. If you are satisfied with the investigation reports of the three murders, then you will leave, and if you wish to investigate the case yourself, in that case, we will have to extend complete support to you. Fine? I guess it would have been better had I left for Kolkata last night? Listen, the cut is not so deep, that it will burn if you sprinkle salt. Just this one case... If you meddle with anything else... Don't worry. I know police procedure very well. You do your work, and I will do my work. Are you going home? You? Here? I sent the PM report in the morning. Didn't you get it? Hey, no, no. All that is fine. Actually, I am not leaving today. I have orders from the headquarters. I will disturb you for a few days. This is good news. You like being disturbed? Ones who have to get disturbed, will get disturbed. See you. Can we talk while you travel home? On the scooty? No, no. You come with me in my vehicle. Deepa can ride the scooty home. Okay, fine. You ride the scooty and follow us. I will come with him in the jeep. - Okay, fine. Come on. You should have seen Mr. Paritosh's face. He taught him a lesson. Serves him right. I prayed last night. Dear God, please bless Sir. Did you see the power of prayer? Oh, yeah. Everything happens because of your God. Of course. Had it not been God's will, Sir would not have come here, and neither would you have changed. Hey, your Sir said he would come to hear me sing. Ask him, whether he will come. Hey, what do you mean by, your Sir? Hey, does the man have a name? Call him Abhuro da. Mm. No! What do you mean, no? Not Abhuro da. Just dada. Hey, you ask him. Will dada come to see me dance? Please. Oh, dear! He is a busy man. Ask him. Please, ask him. - Okay, fine. I'll ask him later. I have three questions for you. May I ask? - Go ahead. One. You have prepared the post-mortem reports for all the murders to date. Did you detect any similarity? The way these murders have happened, it is clear that, the murderer is driven by violent hatred. Violent hatred? Why do you think so? The murderer is well aware... Where to attack, so that death is inevitable. Despite that, he has attacked the victims more than once. So much so that the outer tissues around the wounds are also damaged. Revenge? Yeah, I got it. I understood. Whatever has to be done, I will have to do it. Hey, stop talking nonsense. I am not interested in listening to your crap. Do you know what state you are in? As that Bengali proverb goes, 'A wasteful man is neither useful here nor there.' That is your condition. Bloody nonsense! Do you understand? So, now, what do I do? Tell me? Haldar you made an interesting statement. If that guy stays here, he will find Bikash and Gophe's killer for sure. But the girls are still... In the godown in the backyard. - No, no. I have spoken about that. If he meddles in any other matter, I will report him to the higher-ups. Let this guy from Lal Bazaar find the culprit. And Shanu... Shanu. Where is Shanu? I got it. He must be lying with some girl. Call him. So, Swapan. - Huh. How do you like the place. - Just perfect. No one will ever get to you. Yeah - Thank you, brother. But? Sushil da was telling me to leave this place tonight. I am here. Ask Sushil da not to take the stress. Am I not cleaning the path one at a time? Okay, fine. That scoundrel, Madan. Hey, switch off your phone. Otherwise, they will find this place. Hey, Gour, don't worry so much. No one in Misra's team has the brains, buddy. Now, tell us, who is the next target? Tonight's target is, Nepal. I'll leave today; I'll ask you the rest of the questions later. You have come to my house for the first time, won't you come in? Come in. Tea or coffee? Whatever you prepare well? Not me, Deepa will prepare it. You still have to ask me two more questions? If I get something good, I can wait? Deepa makes good coffee. Two cups. - I'll get it. Why are you still standing? Please, sit down. Sit. Your second question? Were you acquainted with Bikash, Gobindo and Gophe? Who doesn't know them? For how many years have you been here? Third question? - Huh. No, no this was a foul. It's been three years. Okay. Gophe and Bikash did come to my hospital a few times. To your hospital? Why? For their treatment, of course. No. I mean to say what was ailing them? I don't exactly, remember... Bikash had brought his mother. And Gophe... Something got stuck in Gophe's daughter's throat. Okay. What else do you want to know? Tell me? Do you know anyone by the name Shiuli? Of course. She passed her secondary from our school. But why are you suddenly enquiring about her? Are you aware that she is Gobindo Singh's daughter? Brother, he is not receiving my call? We have already lost two members of our gang, and you are busy squabbling amongst yourselves. Brother, Shanu seems to have grown wings. Hey, who are you to decide that? So Shanu has mustered courage? Hasn't your tail grown longer? What do you think? You will sit on this chair after my death? What are you saying, brother? Listen. All of you... Stick to each other from now on. Understood? Otherwise, Sushil will finish you all. Hey, Banda. - Yes, brother? That Shanu must be lying in the red light area? When you see him, ask him to come and meet me. Sure, brother. Chandan. - Yes, brother? Keep an eye on Lal Bazaar. - Okay. Okay, get out all of you. Go on. I had no idea whatsoever. But honestly, that Shiuli is doing all this? I don't believe it. Me neither. But something is disturbing me. Who is out to get the revenge? What do you mean by revenge? No, actually... You were saying that, the murderer seems to be driven by violent hatred. And extreme violence generally stems from revenge. However, it could also be possible that this is not revenge, the murderer attacked multiple times to ensure that the victim is dead? I don't think so. Are you sure? Okay? Okay, I'll see you then. - Okay. Excuse me. Yeah, Naren. Tell me? Yes, of course. I'll go. Okay. Okay, today in the evening, Shiuli is performing at the Paradise Bar. Would you like to go? Sorry. Actually, I don't feel comfortable there. It's okay. Okay, who are these people in that photograph? Me and my elder sister, Disha. Doesn't she stay here? She left us years ago. I was a child then. Oh, I am sorry. Anyway. Bye. Oh, yes Deepa. The coffee was excellent. Thank you. What is it? Any news? Shanu has re-joined Mr. Sushil's gang. What are you saying? That means the game has become interesting. Hello? I have news. "Who's the thief and who's the police in this illusive city?" "Everyone is wearing a mask. You better be careful!" "Who's the thief and who's the police in this illusive city?" "Everyone is wearing a mask. You better be careful!" "What are you looking for? What do you understand?" "You will vanish if I as much as bat an eyelid." "Come with me on this intoxicating night." Hey, your phone is ringing. - "I will cry on your shoulders." Shanu! - "My heart is missing. " "Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey... - Hello, Shanu. Where are you? "My heart is missing." - I'll just come. "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." Hey, Shanu! What's up with you? Where are you these days? In Mahua's lap? Brother was looking for you. - That's stale news. I'll give you fresh news. Listen to me carefully. Do you know who I have found? Who? - Gaur and Swapan. Both of them are in hiding in the brick kiln. Who gave you the information? Who else? My sweetheart, Mahua. Come over if you want to meet them. You keep an eye on the two. I and Nepal are on our way. I will finish the two of them at the brick kiln. Come over, as soon as you can. Sir, please come out. Case jaundice. "My heart is missing." - Sir. Shanu has caught two of Sushil's men at the brick kiln. He will kill them if we don't go. Let's go, hurry up. - Yes, sir. "My heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." "My heart is missing. Hey, my heart is missing." Hey, move aside. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. Start the bike. Hey, what happened? - The bike won't start. Oh, darn! Who is that? You? Get aside! Subtitles Exclusively Arranged By:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Naren, give me the torch? - Yes, sir. We can hardly see anything clearly in this darkness. Naren. - Yes, sir. Where? I can't make out, sir. This is the one, right? Sir, there is only one brick kiln here. Call out their names. Call out their names. Yes, yes, sir... Shanu da! Shanu! Come out. This is SI Naren! Hey! Shanu! Shanu! Have the guys fled. - There is no sign of them, sir. I think they have left, sir. Huh! - Sir. Shanu da! - Hey! Shanu! Hey! Sir. Who there? Wait! Naren, hold him. - Yes, sir. Wait! Hey! Stop, I say. Hey, scoundrel! Stop! Stop, I say. Stop the bike here. Switch off the headlight. Come this way. This way. I couldn't catch him, sir. he escaped. Call the police station, immediately. What is it? Is the work done? Go, eat your dinner and rest. It is quite late. Mo***rf**ker! Someone killed my boy under your man's nose. What was your police doing? Were they sleeping? Scoundrels! Disconnect the call. I will speak to you later. Let me speak to your guy from Lal Bazaar. Tell me. What do you have to say? Tell me? Tell me? Tell me? Look, whatever I tell you, now. Listen to it very carefully. Do you understand Bangla? If you don't come clean right away then, all your guys will die one after the other, and you won't be able to do a thing. Tell me? What do you want to know? Good. Okay, now tell me, do you suspect anyone? Of course. That Sushil... Sushil. Today is proof enough. Isn't it? What do you mean by its proven? Actually... Shanu. Shanu had asked my Nepal and Madan to come here. He said that he would hand over Swapan and Gaur to them. Isn't it? Who are Swapan and Gaur? Yes... They are... Sushil's men. They have been absconding for the past seven days. Yes, so what does that mean? What does that mean? They committed a murder again and went underground. They disappeared. That is not possible. - Why? You probably don't know, but it was Mr. Sushil, who spoke to the DM, and has requested the Commissioner to investigate this case. And because Mr. Sushil called last night, the Home Ministry, has permitted me to stay here and investigate this case. 'Hey, Rabi. Give it to me.' Now tell me. What do you have to say? So, who is, committing these murders? You have so many men... Are they fighting amongst themselves? Means? What are you implying? Look, just after the murder, we saw a guy wearing a hoody run. Could he be your man? Or maybe you or your men, have done something to someone... And now, he is exacting revenge. Think. Think. Please call me, if you remember anything. I am also trying. If I get to know something, I will inform you. Mr. Paritosh. Please ask Esha madam, to prepare this post-mortem report as early as possible. Oh, oh, oh. Mr. Misra. Your men have been hovering around here for quite some time, tell them... Tomorrow... At any hour, to come to the police station once. I have some questions for them. See you. Let's go, Naren. I am famished. Take her away from my sight. I won't look. Take her away. Take her away. Take her away from my sight. I won't look. I won't look. I won't look! Take her away from my sight. I won't look. I won't look. - Mom! Mom! Take her away from my sight. - Mom, what's wrong, mom? Mom, mom, mom, mom. I am right here? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong, mom? What's wrong? They are taking her away. They are taking her away. They are not taking her away, mom. Mom, she is here. She is here. - They will take her. They are taking her away. They are not taking her away, mom. They are taking her away. - No, mom. What's wrong, mom. They are not taking her anywhere. Nowhere, mom. She is here. Please calm down, mom. They are taking her away. She is right here. - 'Disha! Esha!' 'I am here. You won't be able to find me.' 'Esha!' 'Hey, Esha, come on.' - 'Hey, caught you!' 'Esha!' 'Esha, where are you?' - 'Hey, Disha!' 'Esha. Esha!' What is the matter? Why are you here? Sir, Shiuli asked me to take you to her house. Why? What happened? She did not say anything, sir. She called me and asked me, if I could take you to her house, once in the morning. We will do all that later. Let's go to the police station. Sir. Mr. Gurupada. - Mr. Paritosh. Gobindo... Bikash... Gophe... Shanu. Among these, only Gobindo was Mr. Sushil's man. Sir. And the rest of them were Bhagirath's men. Gobindo joined Mr. Sushil's group about six months ago. Actually, he was Bhagirath's man. He was a driver. Gobindo was Bhagirath's man? - Yes. Yeah, tell me. I'll speak to you later. Hey, I told him. No! Okay, okay, you disconnect the call. I'll call you later. That was Shiuli, sir. She wanted to know when you will go? Go to the record room and, six months ago, or even older, if there are any old case files of these four. Fish them out. So, Mr. Gurupada, for how long have you been posted in this station? It's been seventeen years. I am a local. Good. Please, help Naren. I'll be back in an hour. And what do I need to do? Tell me? You come with me. There is work to do. Oh, huh! - What happened, sir? Mr. Paritosh, I have an important errand. Please, wait here for a while. I'll be back soon. I... Mean... What was that? Sir asked us to look... But I don't think we will find anything. Why did you not tell sir, then? Tell me? - Hey, when will he come? I don't know. - Hey, you promised me. Hey, yes, dear. He is refusing to listen to me. You give the phone to dada. He just left with Mr. Paritosh. Oh! He left? You are here? Come, come, come, come. Come inside. What is the matter? Tell me? One minute. Extend your right arm. What? Extend your right arm. Today is 'rakhi.' 'Here sister-in-law. This is for you. 'Thank you.' Is that why you stayed hungry all morning? Until I tie a 'rakhi' to my brother, unless I feed him, sweets, can a sister eat anything? Here, eat these sweets. - Hey! Who will eat so many sweets? I can't eat so much! You will eat. - Hey. Okay, okay. Wait. Brother and sister will eat these sweets together. This is for you. Keep this. And buy something for yourself. This is my first, gift from my brother. I love it the most. I will never spend it. I will keep it carefully. Hey, hey, hey. Let it be. Bless you. Okay, listen. I am in a hurry. I must leave now. Hey, you must have your lunch with me today. I have told your student. Don't be too late. Okay, done. Bless you. Everything is torn! All these years you were the one who tore the papers. Now, where will you get the complete reports. What is this, sir? Didn't you go? He asked me to stand and drove off. Hey, instead of sitting here, go and arrange for some tea. Sir, if we don't find the files, you will get into trouble. Why? No, I mean, the ones the murderer is going after, are all Mr. Misra's men... And you are also... What say Gurupada da? You are right, buddy. I did not think about this. Hey, hey! It's okay. You needn't think so much. You. You get up! Hey, hey, listen... Those files there... Bring them down before I come back. Go, get up! - Oh, okay. Bring them down, - Oh, dear. Naren. Why are you standing here, like Vivekananda? You, go, go. Help him! Go! Let's see Senabhuti, lift your hand. - The kite... I hope you know, today is 'rakhi.' This is for you. - Come here, come to me. I don't see Shiuli here? Shiuli is a bit busy today, sir. Shiuli is busy cooking a meal for her brother. Wow! Very nice. - Show me your wrist. - Let me see. Come. Come to me. - Take this. Come, come one at a time. Come one by one. Come in front. Let me see, extend your arm. Oh, dear! You are wearing another 'rakhi.' Take this. Go. - Who tied it on you? Your brother? Hey, sister... - Huh? Do you want to tie a 'rakhi?' Hey, I am in a hurry. Bye, huh. - Hey. Deepa. Hey, no! What are you up to? I am sure he is here for some work. Please tell me, Mr. Abhuro. I better leave. You all talk. Hey, hey, hey! Come on, let's all go that side. Father... - Yeah. You come along. We will talk there. - Why? What happened? Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Oh, I see. You please, wait - I want to talk to you? Last night there was another murder. I am sure you have heard? I know. Shanu. Is it possible to get the post-mortem report by evening today? I will try. Deepa. - Yes? Listen. Tell me? Are you ready? - Yes. I'll see you then. - See, you father. See you. Excuse me. Excuse me. See you, child. Hey, Mr. Master! You were saying something? Can we sit somewhere and talk. Please, come with me. Don't run. Go straight home. Stay in a queue. Listen, I am telling you. He has a crush on you. Ah! Don't talk rubbish. Keep this. Listen, that Gobindo Singh was Shiuli's father, did you check that in the school register? Yes, Mr. Abhuro is right. I had no idea that Gobindo uncle was such a scoundrel. I am glad he died. I think, Shiuli killed him. Don't talk rubbish. - You, mark my words. For how long has Bhagirath been committing atrocities? Bhagirath turned out to be just like his father. Earlier, during his father's time, he, along with his men, would create havoc in the village. And now after his father, he has become the king. So, as you say, he has harmed so many people? All these years hasn't anyone, lodged a report against them with the police? Report? Yes, one person did. However, after a day or two, the person disappeared. What was his name? Baidyanath. Baidyanath Ghoshal. Brother. - What is it? Take a look. What are these names? Take a look. - Huh. Gobindo Singh. Shantanu Das. Nepal Kundu. And what is this... Gopeshwar... Pramanik. Madan Patro... Shah. Shah. Shah. Let me check the date. 14.07.2006. Who wrote the diary entry. Look, there is an entry on the margin. Baidyanath... Huh. Huh. Huh. - The rest of it is torn. Oh, no! I may have torn it. Have you found something? - Huh. Sir, take a look at this. Now what? Won't you come for lunch? I told you, sir, went out. I know. He came to my place and went to the school... To meet the school master. I see, my brother-in-law is a good man. You seemed to have mustered a lot of courage? Wait, let dada come. Then I'll show you. Hey, I think he is here. I'll disconnect. You also come. What do you think? Who is committing these murders? What can I say? However, whoever it is? He is doing good work. by getting rid of the troublemakers from this earth. May God bless him. I don't know what God will do? However, I won't spare him, if I find him. Why? Don't you think? Whoever is doing it? Is doing the right thing? No, sir. Only the law has the right to punish, no one else. Law? There was a time when we also believed in all this. But in all these years, your so-called law was no where to be seen in this village. Hey, grandpa. Let's go. Come. Hey, grandpa. Come. Play with us. Tell us a story. - Yes, of course. I'll come , dear. Then I'll take your leave, Mr. Dutta? Let's go. So, which story do you want to hear, today? Which story do you want to hear? The other day you were telling us about that bad man. 'The bad man's story.' [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] Why isn't she picking my call? What's that, sir? Did you have your lunch? Hey, no, no. I came so that we could go together. Let's go. What happened? Sir, I called Shiuli a few times. She is not picking my calls. I don't understand why? I am sure she is angry. Let's go. Did you find something? Yes, sir. In the year 2006, someone filed a complaint against them. The man's name was... - Baidyanath Ghoshal. Yes, sir. But how did you know? It's very simple, how I found out. Keshab Chakraborty. But the case is, of the six, four are dead. Who is taking revenge? And besides, what was their crime? Yeah, tell me. - Yeah, what I am saying is, do you know anyone, by the name Baidyanath? Baidyanath, who? That is what I am trying to figure out. He had filed a case against your boys, fourteen years ago. Fourteen years ago? - Yes. This is all rubbish. You tell me one thing? Did you know that Gobindo was Shiuli's father? What are you saying? Yeah. Hey, where are you getting all this important information from? I need you for some work. I'll come to the police station in some time. I am leaving now. Come, sir. Shiuli. Hey! Shiuli! Shiuli! Hey! Shiuli! I think she has fallen asleep. It's 2:30 PM. What do we do? Sir, there is a, backdoor. Come, sir. This door is wide open, sir. Let's go. Shiuli! Hey! Shiuli! Shiuli! - Shiuli! Hey, Shiuli! - Shiuli! Hey, hey! Shiuli! Shiuli! Shiuli! Say something. - Shiuli!

Naren, we must rush her to the hospital. Hurry up! Quick! - Shiuli! Shiuli! Shiuli! Let's go. - Nothing will happen to you, Shiuli. The Himalayas lie to our North. The Himalayas lie to our North. - Very good. And the sea in the south. And the sea in the south. The Himalaya mountains lie in the North. The Himalaya mountains lie in the North. What is it? Master, the goons have entered Shiuli's house. What? - Yes. Papri. - Yes, sir. Look after them. 'So, what will the students say now?' 'The Himalayas lie to our North.' Hello? Hello. - 'And the sea in the south.' There has been a disaster. Doctor! - Come on. Doctor! Doctor! - Doctor, madam. Doctor! - Doctor, madam. Hey, Shiuli! Shiuli! - Naren, put her here.

Madam... Sir, Shiuli... Naren! Naren. Nothing will happen to Shiuli. Sir. - She is alive, Naren. Please, calm down. Sir, she hasn't done anything. Sir. Then, why her? Tell me, what harm had she done, sir? She didn't do anything, sir. 'Until I tie a 'rakhi' to my brother, unless I feed him, sweets,' 'can a sister eat anything?' Is Shiuli alright? Mr. Dutta? How is Shiuli? Sir, whoever has done this to Shiuli? I will not spare them! I won't spare them! - Naren. Naren. Calm down. Sir, please, look after him. I'll just be back. No, sir. I will come with you. I will not spare anyone. I will not spare anyone. - Naren Naren, when Shiuli regains consciousness, she will want to see you first. It is important for you to stay here. - No. Master, sir. Will Shiuli recover? Come, come. Sit here. Sit. Sit. Everything will be alright. Everything will be alright. Come out! Why did you stop my car? What happened? Who attacked Shiuli? Shiuli? What happened to Shiuli? Hey, listen, Bhagirath. Stop playacting. I am giving you an hour. Ask your men to surrender. Otherwise, if I have to hunt them down... Let aside what I do to them... I will not spare you! You may ask that Haldar of yours! Who is Abhurojit Dutta? Hey, this is so strange. My men are dying one after the other. And you are threatening me? Hey, your time is coming to an end, huh. If you want to survive, then recollect what did you do fourteen years ago? Otherwise, that Baidyanath will come after you. Baidhyanath? Who is this Baidyanath? It is your responsibility to think back and find out. But, whoever has attacked Shiuli, find him and ask him to surrender at the police station immediately. Because, remember one thing... Shiuli is alive, huh. She will tell us who attacked her, once she regains consciousness. And after that, just think what will happen to you? And that is why I am telling you, find the person and ask him to surrender. See you. Her pressure is a bit low. Keep an eye on that. If her BP rises you must inform... - Esha. Inform me. Go and check the pressure. - Esha. How is she now? I have transferred her to a bed. But she is still very weak. Actually, she has lost a lot of blood. So, her pressure is very low. We have put her on saline. But, it takes time you know? Do you know, who did this? Who? - Madan and Nepal. I had my suspicions. But I did not think the both of them are involved. How did you come to know? Nitai da. Nitai da saw them entering Shiuli's house some hours ago. If they surrender... Good. Otherwise, Bhagirath and his men will find out, who is Abhurojit Dutta. Shiuli. Hey, Shiuli. Shiuli. - Huh. Shiuli. Who did this to you? Just tell me the name, once. Please, Shiuli. Tell me. I will not spare anyone. Tell me, Shiuli. Tell me. What do you want? We want you. We want you. - Ah! Huh! This... This is no right. - Shut up! So then? - Ah! Huh! What will you do? - Ah! Huh! Will you kill us? - Let me go! What will you do, huh? - Ah! Huh! Now, whatever has to be done? We will do it. - Huh! But before that, tell me? You... That uncle of yours... Your father... Both of them sold you to Padda. You killed them... You did well. The right thing... But why did you kill Gophe and Shanu? Tell me? I haven't killed anyone. Believe me. I haven't killed anyone. Don't lie, Shiuli. What do you think? What were you thinking, huh? By killing us, you will save all the local girls from us? You will save them, hmm? Now? Now, who will rescue you? You don't do anything. Don't do anything. Da... Where is dada? What is it? Why are you here? Brother called me. Go, go away. Brother asked us to surrender. Are you out of your mind or what? If that Lal Bazaar gets his hands on you, once, will he ever allow you to come out alive? Brother said if we don't surrender, he will finish us. Mr. Misra has gone mad. Okay, fine. I will talk to him. You all go. Go. - Let's go. Hey, hey. One minute. One minute. Now, I have understood why brother asked you to surrender. Because of that Baidyanath. Hey, can you tell me, what did you do fourteen years ago? Because of which that man has come out of nowhere and is killing you all? What are you saying? Then Shiuli is not the murderer? - Darn! Shiuli doesn't have it in her. She is a mere girl. Wait a minute. Gurupada. - Yes, sir. Listen, I have spoken to them. Go. Go with Gurupada. He will hide you in a place, that no one will ever find you. See you. Hello. Sir. The work is done. Sir. Sir. Please, give me the permission. I will not spare any of them. Naren. The law will punish them. They will surrender at the police station soon. Yes, Mr. Paritosh. tell me. Sir, Madan and Nepal have escaped. What do you mean by they escaped? Did they come to the police station? Yes, yes. First, they came and said, that brother asked us to surrender. 'And then as I was about to lock them up,' 'They pushed me and ran...' Look, I hurt myself with the rod and have a swelling on my head, sir. Oh, sorry. How can you see it on the phone? Sh*t! - What happened? Nepal and Madan have escaped. Naren! Naren! Come this way. Come. Here, here, here. You can stay here. There is nothing to worry about. Hey, no one will find you here. Understood? Just arrange this place to suit yourselves. Oh, I remember. Give me your mobile phones. Why? Hey, that officer from Kolkata is too bright. He will use the mobile network to trace you. Give it to me. Give. There is no reason to be afraid. Give. Let me see, how he finds you this time? Move. - Yes, sir. Where have you hidden those guys, tell me? Tell me? - What, what, what? What is this behaviour? You are misbehaving with a senior? What is the meaning of this? Hey, Gurupada, why are you staring? Get him. Sir. Where have you hidden them? Tell me. Tell me, where are they? Tell me? Otherwise, I'll kill you here, today. Believe me, brother. I don't know anything. Look, they pushed me and ran. Look at this wound on my head. I will punish you for your sins today. - Hey! Naren, leave him! Naren, leave him! Let me go, sir. - Hey, Naren! Naren, if he has done something, the law will take its course. Naren! Naren! It's an order! Calm down, Naren. I am telling you not to take the law into your hands. To hell with your law! All your law does, is safeguard the vermin of this society! Your law can't do anything else! The other day, he released the ten girls under your nose! Could your law do anything? Nothing! And you! You have been languishing in that police academy for one year! Why, sir? Tell me, why? Naren, don't cross your limit. - Darn! Anyone can say such things, but not us. Because we are the guardians of the law. And it falls under our duty to maintain its respect. Respect? For all these years, all you have done is give respect, sir. Out of respect for the law, you jailed that Babu Chiota. So what happened? What did your law do? He came out in three months and destroyed your entire family! What could your law do? Nothing! And now that man is the sitting MLA of that area. And you... In this Gobindopur, under pressure from your seniors are oiling that man's b*tt! And you are lecturing me on the law! I will take revenge for Shiuli! Sir. Let's see if your law can stop me. Sir, I must tell you something. I know who Baidyanath Ghoshal is. Hey, pick up the call. Who knows where does he hang around? Sir, look here. Keshab's name is here. Nitai! G... Means Gobindo. Bikash? Shanu. Another G. Gophe? Isn't that so? Mr. Keshab Chakraborty. FIR 339... By seven 2006. Baidyanath Ghoshal has lodged the FIR. Below that was your signature. How is this Baidyanath Ghoshal related to you, sir? My sister's husband. Fourteen years ago, My sister, brother-in-law and, their only daughter came to our house for a feast. Just two days after that, the incident took place. What are you thinking, Nepal? Fourteen years ago, do you remember what had happened? What is it? Tell me? We were on our way back from the 'Rath mela...' We were walking by the riverbank... Just at that time... [Indistinct chatter] - 'Esha!' 'Hey, Esha!' - 'I am here.' 'Esha!' 'Hey, Esha!' 'Come out, Esha. I don't like this anymore. Come out, please.' 'Please, Esha. It's your turn now.' 'I am going to take off the blindfold, now.' 'Esha! Please, come out, Esha!' 'I am not enjoying this any longer.' 'I won't play anymore.' On the riverbank, her body was lying in the muck. My sister and brother-in-law almost went mad. Their innocent daughter... How did you find out? Her sister... My daughter... Saw everything from behind a tree. And she ran back in fear, and informed me. Who, Deepa? Esha. I see, you remember everything? What is this? You? A twelve-year-old girl... That day, when she saw her sister in that state, could not do a thing. 'Help! Help me, Esha! leave me!' 'Hold her tight.' - 'No, Esha! Help!' 'Hold her from that side. Hold her properly. - No, Esha!' 'Disha!' - 'Come on, come on.' 'Esha!' 'I kept quiet and saw you commit that atrocity!' I waited for so many years, and now, your time has come. It was not right for you to take the law into your hands. We cannot allow Esha to commit another crime. The wolf cries when he realises, he is trapped! Subtitles Exclusively Arranged By:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Come. Now, run! Where will you go? You were running amok all this while. Now, call your father! Let's see how he rescues you? Why did you attack, Shiuli? Tell me? She has never harmed you? - Hey! Na... Naren, we made a mistake. Please, arrest us. Calm down. - Calm down. We have accepted our fault. You can handcuff us. Handcuff us. - Yes, yes. Take us to the police station! Take us to the police station! Yes. Scoundrel, now you have realised that I will kill you. So, you want the law to shelter you, right? No one will be able to save you. No one. Just drop the gun. Drop the gun, Naren. You can shoot me if you want. But no one will be able to protect them today. As a senior officer, it's my order. Drop the gun, or I'll shoot you. Wow! Sir Great! The people who have committed crimes under your nose, instead of punishing them, you are asking me to step aside? The law will punish them for their crimes, Naren. Law! Law! And law! There will be one atrocity after another, and your law will tie a band on its eyes and deliberate on that! This game will go on for a few years... And after that? What will happen after that, sir? Then, due to lack of evidence, your law will acquit them! Sorry, sir. I will not be able to listen to you. Naren! - Huh! Ugh! Naren. No! Naren! - Let me go, sir. Naren, stop it! Sir, let me go! I will not spare them today. - Naren! Naren! I will not spare you today. Naren, the law will punish them. - Hey, wait! The law will not be able to touch them, sir. He is overdoing it! Naren! Naren! Naren, Stop acting crazy! Leave me. - Naren! Leave me, sir. - Enough is enough! Esha! Esha! Stop! Esha, if you take another step, I will have to shoot you. Esha, you cannot take the law into your hands, Esha! All these years, your law could not punish them, Abhuro. My father and uncle, fell on the police's feet for help. But your law did not do anything then. 'My father and uncle fell at the law's feet...' 'Disha died in front of my eyes. My sister!' 'I couldn't do a thing.' 'These people were released from the police station as they were Bhagirath's men.' 'My helpless uncle committed suicide.' 'And my auntie lost her mental balance.' 'Father took me and my aunt away from Raghunathpur.' For all these years... I carried the weight of this pain, every single day, in my heart. I did not allow myself to forget all this for a moment. So, three years ago, after I became a doctor, I came back to this village just to take my revenge. I have finished five of them. He will not get away either. Esha. Esha, please don't commit another crime. I will do the needful. - What will you do, sir? He will get away again. - Kill him. Kill him, Esha. Kill him! I am telling you. Don't listen to anyone. Kill him! [Spits] - Yes, madam. All of us are with you. - Yes, kill him! Kill him. Kill him, madam. Kill him! Kill him. Kill him. Esha, I am telling you for the last time. Just stop! That means the whole thing was a gang war? Yes, sir. Mr. Haldar was right. Bhaghirath's man, Madan. He committed all the murders. We caught him red-handed the day he killed Nepal. He was about to shoot me... So, I had to return fire under duress. Anyway. I am happy to see you did not make the same mistake the second time. Thank you, sir. Oh, yes. Another thing. I have sealed all Bhagirath's businesses. Hey. Let it be. Let it be. Bless you. - Well done, Abhuro. Very well done. So then? When are you coming back to the field from the police academy? It's your decision, sir. Well, Haldar. I will forward the order. Oh, that's fine. That's fine. Okay, Abhuro. See you then. Later. Sir. - Bye. I am feeling relieved after a long time. Same here.
