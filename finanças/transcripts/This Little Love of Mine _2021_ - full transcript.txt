- Laura, it's fine, I'll see you - at the office. I'll be there soon. Morning, Chip. Hey, man! Morning, Laura. Morning, Frank. Oh! I heard you pulled out all the stops to save the Peterson account. - They'll have to make you - partner now. - I hope so. There's a lot - of changes I'd like to make. Like getting you that raise you should've gotten last year. - Congratulations, Laura. - You did it. - Oh, I'd like to review the - contract one last time, Fiona. - Laura, it's perfect, - they've signed it. It's done. They've signed it? Already? Yes, it's time to celebrate. So as your boss, I am ordering you to brag. Tell everyone how you did it. Well, Mr. Peterson might run an international corporation, but he's a local businessman at heart. I explained the opportunity in local expansion and persuaded him not to sell. Local expansion worth 250 million. Wow. He wanted what was best for the community. I just helped him to see that. Laura, you're always so modest. It's all thanks to my lucky charm. Because the long hours and late nights had nothing to do with it. - On an entirely - different subject, - What do you know - about Graham Finley? Graham Finley, billionaire, highly educated, international property developer, terrible at coconut toss. I told you that I grew up in Sapphire Cove until I was 12. Your idyllic childhood on a tropical island. How could I forget? I grew up with the Finley's. His grandson Chip was my best friend. We lost touch though. Ah. That explains it. Explains what? Why there's a billionaire in my office. Waiting for you. Mr. Finley. Laura Price. My goodness. All grown up. - Mr. Finley, it's - so wonderful to see you again. I remember when you and my grandson filled my Mercedes with seaweed. So it's a bit late for "Mr. Finley" now. Please. - Well, I've heard - all about your achievements From Mrs. Wilde here. The valedictorian. A portfolio of high-profile clients. A promotion waiting in the wings. You've certainly made your mark since leaving Sapphire Cove. Well, it's not as impressive as your legacy but I'm not finished yet. That's the Laura I remember. Ambitious and determined. You may not have noticed, Laura, but I've gotten old. I'm 85 soon. 85 is a significant milestone, Mr. Finley. - You see, I am CEO - of the company Until the day I choose to step down or... Or your 85th birthday, whichever comes first. Whichever comes first. The mandatory retirement clause. Retirement clauses are notoriously difficult to outmaneuver. Oh, it's much too late for any of that. My son was not a good fit. But it's not too late for my grandson. I want to name Chip my successor because it's my last chance to keep my business in the family. So he needs to sign on the dotted line before I turn 85. Laura can draw up a contract immediately. Good, because I need you to take it to him and get him to sign it. We don't have a lot of time here and he can be a little stubborn. You're the only one he's ever listened to. - She'd be delighted to take - the contract to Chip. Of course. Where exactly is Chip living these days? Well... Sapphire Cove? Now? I can't go now. It's been forever. - I haven't spoken to Chip - since I was a kid. - I didn't even know - what he looks like. - Well, don't over - complicate it. You fly over, find Chip, get the contract signed - and you'll be back - in a few days. - Fiona, I have - so much work to do, - I'm going to be working late - as it is. Why don't you take Owen? You two can spend some time together before the big day. - Actually, we decided to push - the date back again. Again? I know... We've been so busy. Besides, I thought that I would hear about the partnership soon. We're still in talks. It's down to you and Simon. Simon? Mmm-hm. He brings in big clients. That means big money. - But what about my local - business plan? Yeah, yeah, they loved it. More face-to-face time with clients, - protect small businesses. - They ate it up. But at the end of the day, money talks. Graham came to you for a reason. - He really thinks - you can persuade Chip. Bringing in a client like Graham Finley might just be the edge you need. Do you think so? I know so. Besides, there are worse places to end up than on a tropical island. Fine print is my specialty. Yeah, alright, fantastic. Honey, I am so sorry. I'm so snowed under right now. What were we talking about? We were talking about Sapphire Cove. Yes, yes, your hometown. - I haven't been there - since I was a kid. But this work thing kind of popped up and I thought that maybe we could go there together. Once I get this contract signed then we can just relax for once and it might be nice. I don't know, honey. I could - really use the extra hours - Around the office right now. I just have to go there - and get Chip Finley to sign - this contract in person And then if all goes well, I might get the whole Finley account. You will get the whole Finley account. - This is the big leagues now, - honey. Look, I know you love all that charity work you're doing, but... - Giving smaller clients more - time isn't exactly charity work. - It's what legal representation - is meant to be about. Honey, remember, we're sharks. And think of this Finley account as your prey. We are always hunting. Keeping our eye on the prize. And then when it's in our sights... that's when we pounce. Well, let's hope that Chip Finley isn't too hard to hunt down. You'll be great. - Welcome - to Sapphire Cove Where the local time is 8:02 a.m. Welcome to Sapphire Cove. If you make your way down to the pier, our captain is waiting to take you to the hotel. The captain? After you. Well, this is one way to get around. Sure beats rush-hour traffic. First time to the island? Uh... No. But it's been a very long time. Well, better late than never. Let me guess. Lawyer. Oh! That obvious? - Not everybody gets so dressed - up to come on vacation. Right. Well, my turn. You must be... the captain. Lucky guess. - -Dude... - -What? Your shirt! Oh! Oh. You could've told me earlier! There we go. Welcome to the Royal Hotel. Mind your step. Welcome. Sparkling wine? Hi. How are you? So have a good trip. - If you can, treat yourself - to a pair of sandals. I hear they're much more comfortable than heels. I might just do that. Thank you. - And if you need someone to - take you around the island, We do offer guided tours. - Actually, you might be - able to help me... - -Yoo-hoo. - -What? Anybody home? - -Welcome drink, ma'am? - -Oh. Thank you. Take the bag! Thank you. When you book at the front desk ask for Chip. Chip? This way, please. - Your bag will be delivered - straight to your room. "Dear Laura... A little taste of the high life. Enjoy. Fiona." Where's the Wi-Fi password? Laura? - -I haven't seen you in so long. - -Gem! - When I saw your name - on the reservation, - I couldn't believe it. - You came back. I did. It's been forever. Gosh, look at you all fancy and grown-up. - Oh, yes, well, - as assistant manager - Of the Royal Hotel, please - do not hesitate to let me know - If there is anything I can do to - make your stay more enjoyable. Oh, I love this suite, by the way. It is my favorite. It's magnificent. I mean, this whole resort is incredible. Oh, that's right. You didn't live here when it was getting built. - Well, it's all courtesy - of Finley developments. - We have - so much to catch up on. - There is a ton to do - around the island - And of course Graham's birthday - celebration's this weekend. It is the event of the summer - and I have my eye on - the general manager position. So if all goes well... You'll get a promotion? Ah, that's exciting. - You are staying longer - than three days, right? This is just a short trip. - Oh, so you're not here - for Graham's party? Actually, I'm here to see Chip. Oh! Oh. What does "oh" mean? You don't have a contract with you, do you? Maybe. Let's get you a coconut. Oh! Do you remember how Chip was when we were kids? As a 12-year-old? Sure. Stubborn, sweet. Always took it badly when he lost at coconut toss. - I'm sure he's grown up - since then. Eh... I did see him on the boat from the airport and he looked pretty grown up to me. - -Mmmm, - -He didn't recognize me though. - You two always had - a thing for each other. Oh, please, we were 12. I know! - Anyway, I think you'll find - the new Chip and the old Chip Have a lot in common. What's your strategy? Well, I guess if he's the old Chip then I better be the old Laura. - And if he still doesn't - recognize me Then we've got an advantage. - Should we have some fun with - him like old times? Definitely. Come on. You got this. Big throw. Ooh! That's too bad. That's too bad. Guess it's my turn. All right. You'll get it. - -Hey, Chip. - -Hey. Oh! - Showing the legal eagle - around, are you, Gem? - I got good news for you. - You're in luck. Just in time to see me beat Karavi at coconut toss again! Can't wait. - He's certainly the - same old Chip. Yep. - You've lost your heels - already. Island life suits you. Let's do this. All right. Here we go. - Woo! - -Boom. All right. - Thanks very much, thank you. - Thank you very much. You ready for this? - I guess we should go - get a contract signed. Let's do it. You win some, you lose some. Good game, buddy. Oh, you must be here for that island tour. She's not here for a tour. Actually, your grandfather is my client. He asked me to bring you this. Ha-ha. Well, that's too bad. - I'm sorry you came all - this way, But I have no interest in becoming the next CEO of Finley Developments. You sure I can't convince you to just read it? - Look, I'm sure you're - very good at what you do, But if all those lawyers my grandad sent over can't get me to even look at it, I'm afraid you're wasting your time. Thanks for coming. Mmm? What's this... what's this game you're playing here? This game? Only the greatest game in Sapphire Cove. This is coconut toss. - Why, you want to take on the - undefeated champion himself? Oh, I mean, that's tempting, but this looks way too complicated for me. All right, well, suit yourself. Enjoy the island. I tell you what, I'll make you a deal. I will play you at coconut toss and if I win, you have to hear me out. And if I win? Oh, I will tear up this contract right in front of you. Oh, you got yourself a deal. All right. I'll set it up. OK. - Laura, Chip's gotten really - good at this game. Good thing I got my lucky charm. So the rules are simple, - but the game gets a little - harder as you go along. You hit a coconut, you go again. - You miss, the other person - gets a shot. - Whoever hits the most - wins the game. So ladies first. It's only fair. Ooh. - Whoo! - -Wow. Good... good shot. - I mean, I heard that the first - one is the easiest. - -Mmm, good shot. - -So... Yes. Beginners luck? Yeah, I'll say. Nice shot! Who is this girl? You'll see. Oh! Yeah! Whoa! Ladies and gentlemen, has the unbeaten Chip Finley finally met his match? The question on everyone's mind is will the newcomer topple the undefeated Chip Finley's coconut-toss reign? Would you stop? - If you can't stand the heat, - get out of the fire. Hey, you, are you sure that you have not played this game before? You know what? I might have played it once or twice as a kid. Can't be sure. You're a lawyer, right? - Is it too late to renegotiate - the bet? I'm thinking if I lose... Hmm... I hear you out at a candlelit dinner under the stars. Yeah? Well, I'm not sure that my fiancé would appreciate that. Ah-ha. So that would be a no, right? Well, no pressure, then. I mean, you know, big shot and all. So don't miss. That's not possible. Nobody ever hits that shot. Undefeated champion, hey? I don't understand. The only person that ever defeated me at this game is... Laura? Laura Price? Surprise. I'll have my people talk to your people. Oooh! No, it's... Oh, that thing I said. Hang on. Wait a minute. Hey. Hold up. Just thought I'd say sorry - for that whole candlelit dinner - with me thing. That's embarrassing. It's fine. We're old friends. It's nice to see you again. You too. Look at you. Miss Big City Lawyer. - Guess those mock court battles - with me came in handy, huh? Ha, huge help! Along with, you know, a four-year undergraduate degree, - followed by law school - and then passing the bar exam, But this is certainly where it all started. Your parents must be proud. They are. Though they want me to become partner. Well, Dad does. Is he a nice guy? My dad? - I mean the guy who put - that ring on your finger. What did you say his name was? Ah... Owen. He's really great. He's a nice guy. We met at a Bar Association dinner. Ooh, power couple, huh? You could say that. What about you? Anyone special? There was once but it's... It didn't work out. - I guess my expectations - were too high. How so? Oh, I don't know. I guess I thought the person I'd end up with would be like my best friend. It's stupid. Anyway, my work keeps me here and as you can imagine, there are not that many fish in the sea. Well, you do have a boat. A captain can sail anywhere to find love, right? Yeah, look, the whole captain thing is really just to keep the bills paid. - You're worried - about paying your bills? - You do know - that your grandfather - Is on the cover - of Business Collective? It's important to me that I make my own way despite my last name. Besides, I got a side project that's important to me. A side project? I'm building homes for people who would otherwise not have a place to call home. - Right, so you are continuing - the family trade! - Not exactly. - It's a charity thing - So it doesn't - have the same profit margin - As Finley developments - would like. Not quite, it's not worlds apart, though. You sure you have no interest in becoming CEO? I've thought about it. A lot. And the answer is no. Are you sure? 'Cause it sounds like a life-changing opportunity. Exactly. - Well, I'll go arrange my - flight home, then. All right! Forget that. What are you doing tonight? Emails, I imagine. No, not anymore. So Gem's parents are coming to dinner tonight - and you have to come. - Come on! If Mrs. B knew you were here - and I didn't invite you to - dinner, she'd never forgive me. - So you do want to take me - to dinner? - No, no, this is strictly - professional. This is professional. But hey, if you want to break Mrs. B's heart, I mean... So you'd tell on me? You told Mrs. B that I broke her kitchen window back in the day. - You did break her - kitchen window. Yeah, but I was gonna fix it. With what? You were nine. - I had a whole plan involving - duct tape and cardboard. It was gonna be great. It was like a MacGyver thing. All right. Well, I better go back to the hotel - and send some emails then if - I'm going to make it to dinner. You're gonna come? But this contract conversation is not over, Chip Finley. Not by a long shot. OK, I don't think we need to bore everyone with all these details. You should have seen his face, Mom, - he was shocked when she - beat him at coconut toss. Oh, Chip, how could you not recognize Laura? - You two were inseparable - when you were kids! She's changed a lot since I last saw her. Here she is. Laura! Mrs. B! Mr. B! You look great. Great to see you, Laura. Oh, hello. My girl, I'm not sure I've ever seen you with your hair brushed. That was so long ago. Theodore, hi, this is my friend Laura. - The welcome speech was scheduled - to begin five minutes ago. Right. Of course. I have the perfect speech all planned out. Tick tickety tock. That's my boss. I better bring you to your table. - Let me know if you need - anything, OK? Drinks are on me. This is the best bit. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Drift Restaurant. The sky is putting on quite the show for us this evening. - Over to the east, - we have the constellation Of the beautiful maiden Andromeda. - Legend has it - she was rescued From a sea monster by the brave warrior Perseus, son of Zeus. After turning the monster to stone, they rode away on his white-winged horse Pegasus and lived happily ever after. And the gods placed them in the night sky as a reminder to all of us to follow our hearts. Enjoy your dinner. Just beautiful. Your drinks. Oh. Thank you. Thanks. So, Laura, are you here for Graham's birthday celebrations? - Oh, Laura's - a corporate type now, She's only interested in the bright lights in the big city. I can still see that wild child in there. Oh, well, Chip is correct. - I do have to head back - to San Francisco right away. Well, can't we convince you to stay? It would be just like old times. I would love to stay but this is a work trip and I need Chip to sign a contract. Are we talking about a Finley Developments contract? Mm-hmm. Well, good luck trying to get him to sign. That is exactly why I'm here. Oh? But Chip doesn't want to be the CEO of his grandfather's billion-dollar business, so... going to have to cut my trip short. - Contract and a guilt trip. - Lucky me! Think of it as a two-for-one deal just for you. How's everything? Oh, just like old times, Laura is telling on me. Of course she is. It's so nice to have you here. I wish I could join you all but my boss is breathing down my neck. He's already criticizing my flower arrangements. Tick tickety tock! So are we ready to order? - You've reached Owen. - If you want to email me at Owen. Fredericks that would be fantastic. Hi, honey. Just checking in. It's late there. - I hope you're not working - too hard. Anyway, just thinking of you and I'm missing you. Owen? Laura. How's it going? Oh, Fiona! Hi. Well, get this. - So apparently Graham's - been trying To get Chip to sign this contract for years with no luck so this might be a little bit harder than we thought. Could I extend my trip by a few days? Get in the game, Laura. - The partners are thrilled that - Graham has come to us for help But you know as well as I do that if this goes well, - he'll bring in - the entire account. You know, Graham champions small businesses, - perhaps we could present - my local business plan to him. Just focus on getting Chip to sign that contract. Right. Yes. - Maybe there is a different angle - that I can work. I really don't care how you do it, just get it done. Keep me updated. Good luck. I'm gonna need more than just luck. I'm gonna need Sapphire Cove Town Hall. Last night was so nice. - I really don't want - her to go yet. She only just got here. I'm sorry, Gem. - I'm not signing my life away - just so you can keep her here. Can't you just pretend you're interested so we can catch up properly? - I'm just as happy - to see her as you are. - But she's not here to catch up, - Gem, she's here to work. So give her some work to do! She spent all evening on her phone, - she's probably got plenty - to keep her busy. Give me that. I mean work that keeps her here. Huh? You are not leaving tomorrow. Chip. Hey. I've been looking over your charity's business records. Where on earth did you get those? - Do you remember - Penny Michaels? Braces, pigtails, allergic to oranges? - Well, guess who works - at Sapphire Cove Town Hall? That can't be legal. Look, you have done an incredible job with your charity. But have you considered what you could do with the resources at Finley Developments? Hmm. - Come on, - you would be unstoppable. Unstoppable? Please. Yeah. - My father spent years trying - to convince the company - To try something new before - giving up and moving away. He realized that those suits are only in it for themselves. There's probably something in that contract that makes me a little more than a puppet. You haven't even read the contract. I have not. - You might be surprised at how - much freedom you would have. I doubt it. You know what? No, you're right. I'm sorry. - That would be a crazy amount - of work, Running a company and a charity? I mean, you're already busy enough as it is here with your little tugboat and playing coconut toss. All right, hang on a second. - I could run Finley developments - if I wanted to. I just don't want to. It's true. In fact, you remember that - seashell jewelry business - I used to have? Those sold like hot cakes. - I mean, sure, that was - some good pocket money, - But I think you - might find that being CEO is - A little bit more time consuming - than collecting sea shells. All right, just because I know how to relax, doesn't mean I can't work hard. - I'm not a workaholic like you, - but I can throw on a suit And get things done. I look great in a suit. Probably. I'm not a workaholic. - You've been here less - than 24 hours - And all you've done - is send emails. In fact, you're the only person that I know to ever cut a vacation short to go back to work. That is not true! I have fun. Really? - -Yeah. - -Like what? Like I read books. Ooh! Books! What kind of books? Like, books about justice and great battles between right and wrong. Do you mean law books? - -Yes. - -That's what I'm talking about. Law books! You know what? I'll read that contract - the minute you remember - how to have fun. Is that a deal? What? I'll relax. Sure. I'll lie by the pool. I'll get a tan. I'll even leave my phone alone. You read that contract. Yeah, OK, I was just... Come on! One page. Excuse me? I will read one page for every fun thing that you do. OK? You know what? I'm not just talking about like, regular like, lying-by-the-pool fun. - I'm talking - about real activities Like hiking and snorkeling and horseback riding. - -I am not horseback riding. - -Oh, you're not? - Oh, well, - that is a deal breaker. We tried. Gem, we tried. Don't tell me I didn't try. Laura, this is perfect. Come on. OK! What's that? OK, I will ride a horse. But I will not sign a liability waiver. You got a deal. Mm-hm. What's next? We are going to keep article 3.1 and we'll replace articles 4.7 and 12.2, thank you. And could you send through my updated itinerary? Sure. Hold on. Come in. Ready? Now is not a great time. - Oh. Here I was thinking you - wanted me to read that contract. But if it's not a great time then I guess... Did I say "not a great time"? I meant now is the perfect time. Oh, sounds perfect. I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm gonna have to cut this short. All right, let's go snorkeling. Are you sure this is safe? I don't think my travel insurance covers snorkeling. Seriously? What's happened to you? It's perfectly safe. We used to do this all the time. When we were 12. - I don't go in the ocean very - much anymore, Chip. - There's no waves. - There's no sharks. It's not jellyfish season and the pirates called to say they're having a barbecue today so you're safe. Come on. For the contract. ♪ She takes me back when I feel the sun ♪ ♪ And I find myself singing the same old song ♪ ♪ And I find myself singing ♪ ♪ The same old song ♪ ♪ Yeah, it all comes back when it starts to feel like summer ♪ That was incredible! That coral reef is so beautiful. Did you see all those tropical fish? I never get to do stuff like this. That's what we call that island magic, remember? - You don't get to snorkel - in San Francisco? Not without catching hypothermia. I've missed this island. It missed you. Strawberry? Thanks. You're gonna read that contract now? Uh-huh. Oh, well, you might want to wipe your hands. Oh. Really? I read, you relax. That's the deal. Got it. Relaxing. - See, this is what I'm - talking about. - Some of these suits - have spent so long in the office - They've forgotten what - it's like in a work site. We need more engineers in the boardroom. We need more engineers? Are you gonna sign it? - No. No. - I mean, "they," obviously. - I'm just doing this for Laura. - We need to humor her. Uh-huh. So what's your plan for tomorrow? - I need to think of more - activities to do. - Do you think she'd - enjoy fishing? She used to like fishing, right? Sure. Lawyers are known for their fishing skills. Or hiking? Maybe you're going above and beyond - to keep a certain - someone interested. Ha-ha, funny. No, Gem, it's not that. - She is doing her part - so I am doing mine. That's all. It was you that told me to keep her here. - -I'm doing this for you! - -OK. And, you know, this is for old time's sake. That's all. Sure. For old time's sake. - We never get weather - like this in San Francisco. I know. It's so nice. Ooh! I just got the itinerary through. And it's official. - I will be here - for Graham's birthday. Oh! Please never leave. We have to get you a dress. Yeah, I mean, how are the plans for the birthday celebration coming along? - I'm getting there. - But there's still a lot to do. I just want everything to be perfect for Graham. - Although, I am more - worried about Theodore. He's impossible to please. Hmm. Hey, hey! I got a blast from the past for you. - Wow! Where did you - find that thing? The old shed! And I picked out the perfect fishing spot. - I hope you have - your lucky charm Because you're gonna need it to catch a fish. Lucky charm? Oh, nothing. Let's go. This way. How long is this gonna take? You're the worst. You got somewhere better to be? Well, I don't have high hopes for lunch. Well, at least you're off your phone. Thank you. So is this your standard Monday morning? Yeah, kinda, I guess. - Why, this isn't part of your - regular routine? I would be on my third coffee by now. My job is more of a 7:00 till 7:00 then a 9:00 till 5:00. Do you love it? Being a lawyer? Yeah. I do. - Although, I wish I could - help people more. I want to be able to pick my own clients and choose the cases I take on. What cases would you choose if it were up to you? Well, don't laugh. Scout's honor. - I want to help - small businesses Who need extra support but they can't always afford it. Sounds kinda hard in a big commercial law firm. Yeah, it isn't easy which is why I'm working so hard to become partner so that I can call all of the shots. Well, some of them at least. That's the Laura I know. Ambitious. I like it. Wow. You're right. This is really spectacular. Oh, come on. I'm sure you and Owen have plenty of spectacular moments. Yeah, I mean, we don't really do stuff like this. Like what? Like have fun? No, we have a serious relationship. We talk about legal precedents and make financial plans, and, you know, grown-up stuff. I'm happy for you. - You love him and that is - the beginning... And the end of everything. I love that quote. Chip! Get it. Get it. Come on! - -We've got something! - -You got it? Yeah. Reel it in. Let's go. There you go. Theodore. What do you think of the new menu board? I thought I'd spruce it up before the party. You don't like it? Needs more flowers. More flowers? Yeah, I can do that. - -Fish and chips for lunch? - -Sure. If you're cooking. Chip. Tickety tock! Hope you're ready for your next adventure. Meet you in 30 minutes. Chip, I don't have time for an adventure. You always used to have time for adventures, come on. - Let's make it an hour. - I need to make some phone calls. Yeah, I do have a contract I have to not read. OK, fine. Where should I meet you? By the palm trees! What palm trees, Chip? You'll find them. That's Chip for ya. Laura! Fiona. Hi. I gotta be quick but I have a plan. It's a little unorthodox and I'm not sure how long it will take, - -but I'm making progress. - Good! - Could you report back - to the partners And let them know that I will make this happen. Laura? Horses? Contract? Fiona, I have to go. But we need to... Princess Andromeda, meet Pegasus. Uh-huh. So that must make you Perseus, son of Zeus? - Yeah, but I'm really - only a demigod. Oh. Hello. Come on. Come on, buddy. - So, tell me something. - Hmm? - Why on earth - did Graham think - That I could make you - change your mind? Don't know. You know Grandad. Once he gets something in his head, it's hard to shake it. I guess he wants what's best for me, it's just he thinks I'm wasted running my charity. You two are both as stubborn as each other. Why didn't you ever leave the island? Seriously? You know what I mean. Why didn't I go chasing my dreams in the big city? Sure. Why not see what the world has to offer? - You forgot what it - was like growing up. I was just the lonely kid in the big house - and my dad was away - more often than not. You left, Gem went to school on the mainland. - It seemed like everyone - was just leaving. You know, staying on the island is like the only thing I felt like I could control, you know? - I didn't realize things were - that hard for you. Yeah, well... This island, the people, it's made me who I am. - I want to get back to that - however I can. Oh, hey, do you see this triangle of land up there? - I'm trying to get to the bottom - of who owns it. - The land rights are ancient - and the council won't release it - Until we find the landowner's - relatives, Which is impossible so there's still a few families - on the island who desperately - need homes. So I was hoping to get that land for them. I love that. - I hope you understand - I have obligations here - That I can't abandon - for some big company - Who doesn't care - about the little guy. You're not your grandfather, Chip. You're you! This would be Chip's company with a different way of doing things. I don't know. Things can change. Just like that. Hey, come on. Yo, no! No fair. - Come on! - Ya! Come on! - Let's go! Let's go! - Come on! Come on... Let's catch her! Catch up, Zeus. I'm trying. Giddap. Come on! Giddap. Come on, boy. Come on, come on! Whoa! Whoa, boy! Whoa. I am so happy that we did this. It almost looked like you were having fun. Maybe a little. Sure you don't have time for adventures? OK, you got me. Thank you. Anytime. Come on. Yeah, sure, Michael. Review the wording. Honey, hi. Oh, did I wake you? Yeah, it's midnight here. Everything OK? - My client has - a paper trail a mile long, I was trying to get on top of it. How's everything with you? How's Emerald Rocks? Sapphire Cove. Actually, I had a really great day. Hey, you know what we should do when we go on our honeymoon? What's that? We should go horseback riding. Ha! That's hilarious. Oh, you're serious! It's just a thought. - Honey, no, no, - I'm not into that. You know that. Why not? It's fun and adventurous. How about you go horse riding and I'll take the pictures. Yeah, it was just a thought. Hey, about the wedding... How do you feel about pushing the date back again? Again? Owen, this is the third time. I know. - But the board has invited me - to a retreat that weekend And you know how important those retreats are for networking. I just... Laura, I just need you to hold on a little bit longer, OK? - We'll set a date - as soon as you get back. I don't know. Owen, I... I think I need a break. Just being back here, it's given me some time to think. About us. Our future. About what I want. - I think I need some time - to work things out. Hey, meeting's in five. Uh... understood. Everyone's in the boardroom. Look, play it the way you want. - Work the scenarios - through for you And let me know where you stand on it all, OK? OK. Thanks, I'll get the broom. Hey, get any sleep last night? Not really. Wild storm. Is everything OK down here? - Just tidying up. - Some big branches came down. - There's been a little damage - to Mom and Dad's place. Oh, my gosh! Are they OK? Oh, yeah, just waiting on a status report from Chip. - -Speaking of... - Hey. How's the house? Nothing too serious. - A drainpipe got pretty beat up. - A few other things. - -But it will be OK. - -OK. Morning, Laura. Morning. I'm glad everything's OK. If Mom happens to be baking, can you bring me back some banana bread? Banana bread. Got it. Please? Thank you. Oh, let me help you with that. Um, I'm gonna grab my tools and get started. James, can you get the ladder? Sounds like a lot of work. Yeah. That looks like a lot of work. It's nothing that can't wait. I can help. All right, then. But no fun, all right? I'm done reading for a little bit. No fun. Promise. OK. Thank you. Oh, and if you could just give me a ham... Hammer. You always were one step ahead. Why don't you two take a break? Thank you. - It's very good of you - both to do this. It's my pleasure, Mrs. B. Besides, we got most of the materials leftover from the build. You're a good man. - Well, come inside when - you're ready for lunch. Thank you. So you built this house? I guess I did. Mr. And Mrs. B had a little financial trouble after he hurt his back and, well, they've done so much for me - that it was - the least I could do. Besides, it proved to be a good prototype for the next few builds. Wow. Do you like it? Chip, this is my dream house. You wait till you see inside. - -You've built four of these? - -That's right. I mean, I would've built more except it's hard to gather the funds. Come on. What's so funny? You talk about building up funds like you don't have a billion-dollar company waiting for your signature. - OK, I know this is - simplifying things But look at what you've built. There is no reason that the charity - couldn't be integrated - into the company. You could do both. - I don't think anyone's - ever tried So hard to convince me of something before. You must really think anything is possible. Anything is possible. This is beautiful. - I always thought they'd end - up together. Everyone did. He was never the same after she left. And this is the living room and kitchen. Oh, wow, your home is just gorgeous. Thank you. Oh, and Gem requested some banana bread. Oh, well, are we ready for lunch? - -Yup. - -Yes. Please. Thanks, Laura. - That deed to our old house has - been giving me grief forever. Oh, it's no trouble at all. - These things can be - a nightmare to deal with. - Yeah, not to mention having to - travel to the mainland For this kind of thing. It's such a bother and expensive. You mean there's no law firm in Sapphire Cove? No, not since Mr. Martin retired. Oh. Okay, I think we're nearly done out here, - just have to attach that support - beam to the retaining wall. Right? Retaining well? Really? What? He offered! Yeah. It's really not a problem. It'll only take a minute. I can help. Ow! Oh, hey, you all right? Yeah, just a splinter. Oh, yeah, that, oof, that is a doozy. You mind if we finish tomorrow? - I should probably take her - to the hotel, first-aid kit. - You should get that removed - for sure. - You're onto something, I think. - Let's go. Very funny. - I just had your safety - in mind, that's all. - -Oh, thank you. - -Careful now. - -Not feeling faint, are you? - -I think I'll survive. - Okay, let me get that for you. - Can't be careful. Why, thank you. Mm-hmm. Ow! - -Oh! Oh, right, are you sure? - -Oh, come on! - You're gonna make it worse. - Gonna have to amputate. Thank you. You OK? I'm OK. Chip. Yeah? Banana bread. - Save some for Gem or - she'll never forgive me. Thank you Mrs. B. Thank you. Hey! See you soon. Get out here. Come on! Got it. I think I... Almost. OK. Here we go. - I would usually do this myself, - it's just... - It's my right - hand and I'm right-handed. It's OK. Stay still. Ow. Got it. You all right? - You know, I think this is - the first time - That I've seen - you without your phone. Ha. Yeah, it's kinda nice not being tied to the office for once. Not bad. Hey, do you... Do you remember when we were kids and we buried that treasure chest with my necklace in it? I spent three months' allowance on that necklace. Hey, you remember we made that map so we wouldn't forget where we put it too? Did you ever... I don't know, think about digging it up? I, uh, almost did. I was gonna dig it up, get that necklace and... come find you in San Francisco. Really? Yeah. But then I thought, "She's probably got someone who cares for her very much - and has got her a nicer, - better necklace And she will have forgotten all about me and my silly fishing "rods and treasure maps." Chip... - -Yeah? - Laura. Owen? Surprise. What are you doing here? Oh! Oh. I missed you! After we talked, I realized I had to come out here and apologize in person. I've been so focused on work that I've started to lose sight of what's important. I don't want to lose you. Oh, and I got some case notes I'd love you to take a look at. Who's this? Owen, this is Chip. - -Chip Finley. - -Hey. Oh, congratulations. - -Oh. - -CEO of Finley Developments. - -Do you have representation? - -Uh... - My firm's known for helping - out big players, that's all. I haven't signed it yet... We haven't really worked out any of the details of the contract so... I'm just kidding. - Of course you're gonna go - with Laura's firm. OK. - -It is nice to meet you, Owen. - -Likewise. And I should probably get this back to reception. - We should have dinner. - Chip, you're free tonight! Oh, no, we don't... No, I insist. Dinner. Great. I will see if Gem can make it too. That would be... great. OK. My little shark. In her natural habitat. - Mom and Dad are really - lucky to have you guys. - Thank you for - helping them today. That's OK. And Laura, she was a real pro with getting that broken drainpipe repaired. - -You helped repair a drainpipe? - -She sure did. - She's not even the worst - apprentice I've ever had. Oh, apprentice, is it? I feel like I at least deserve a promotion to supervisor or... Do you? No, I mean, and, look, if you hadn't eaten the banana bread, - -then maybe you could have. - -I knew there was banana bread! - I don't believe you just - told on me. - -What? - Gem, I am sorry. I was injured. I needed the sugar. - That's not even - the right finger! - Anyway, Laura, - she was a real trooper. You're a lucky man, Owen. I should have married her the moment I saw her. Which is why I've made a decision. Laura, I want you to marry me. Yeah, we've done this bit, remember? At the Law Society Ball? No, I want to get married here. Now. In Emerald Rocks. It's Sapphire Cove. Whatever. I can talk to management. I'm sure they can organize something in a day or two. Nothing outrageous. Small but classy. Family and friends won't be here - but we can have a party when - we get back to San Francisco. - Yeah, Owen, - I just don't think... - Chip could walk - you down the aisle. - Hmm? - -Yeah, what do you say, Chip? Hmm? Oh... How spontaneous. - -More drinks. - Right away. I don't think that Chip would be really want to... Who are we fooling? You know, I was in my office the other night after we had our talk and I suddenly thought, "Laura has been with me through some of the toughest cases I've ever had. She's smart, she's gorgeous. She's one heck of a lawyer. "She's a keeper." You must really like the island, Owen. - I mean, you've only been here - a few hours, But your first impressions must be... impressed. Absolutely. I don't think I could live here, though. Island life wouldn't work for you? Feels a little small for me. Oh. - But hey, different strokes - for different folks. Oh! Excuse me. I gotta get this. Yeah, this place is nice. We should do it here. Hit me. Yeah... Hey. Listen, slow down. He seems nice. - Oh, yeah, - he seems very nice, Laura. - I mean, you know, not for me, - but like he says, - Different strokes - for different folks. He's not usually like this. - -I think he's Jet lagged or... - -Jet lagged, yeah. - You know, I did realize - something, though. - He can't handle life - on a small island And I can cannot be a corporate big shot. Might be OK for some people. But that life will never be me. I mean, there's nothing wrong with wanting to push yourself. I do push myself, Laura. I'm just not gonna be pushed into being a suit like that. - But I'm sure you guys - will be very happy. Wow. I'm going to leave now. Good night. Well, do you want to talk about what just happened? No. What? This is madness. How were we supposed to know he had a bank account in the Cayman Islands? Yeah, I agree we need a realistic approach. Thanks. Let's unpack it when I get back. - One day! I'm gone one day - and the whole thing falls apart. I tell ya... What's wrong, honey? What's going on? - I thought you'd be - happy to see me. Grandad? Oh, Chip. Listen to this. I was not expecting you back yet. It's a letter you and Laura wrote apologizing for stealing banana bread. "Dear Mrs. Bailey..." We regret the theft occurred and wish to apologize wholeheartedly on behalf of our evil twins. - We really hope that - we are still allowed To hang out with our best friend Gem. We promise to mow your lawn for the entire summer. Sincerely, evil twins, "Chip and Laura." It's not really a good time right now. What are you doing here? I flew in early for the birthday celebrations. And I thought I just... Hide from all your friends? Something like that. I see you've been fishing. Those rods must be a million years old. I took Laura out. Oh, yes, and how did it go there? Grandad, could you just stop with the contract? - I know it's your birthday soon - and I know you want me to sign, But I'm sorry, I'm not your guy. Well, now you've brought it up, I've said it before and I'll say it again, you are the right man. - We went through this with Dad. - Remember how that turned out? You are not your father. - And things were - very different then. It's a completely different company now. A company you can be proud to run. This company is your future. What's happened, Chip? People change. Things change. And Laura? I wondered whether the two of you had hit it off again. You two were always so happy together. Well, it's not like that now. I mean, we... She has a fiancé. Who literally just arrived here and he wants to marry her on the island tomorrow. And did she invite him here? No. He surprised her. Did he? Well, things change. I gotta go. Things change. I want my husband to be my best friend. Someone that I can have adventures with. I feel like our careers have taken priority over everything. Over us. It's all we ever talk about. Take away the work and... what's left? Well, I can change. I can work less. It's not about you, Owen. It's me. I'd stopped being myself. I guess it took me being back here to realize who I truly am. I'm sorry. It'll be alright, buddy. I promise. - Karavi, can you check that - the linen has arrived, please? And that the kitchen got the vegetable and the herb order? It's almost time to open. You got it, boss. Is there, like, a dessert-related emergency that I haven't heard of? - I'm just checking options - for Graham's party. He likes chocolate, right? Uh... Does he like chocolate? Try this. Mmm... Are you still reading that? Figured out how to get the engineers into the board meetings yet? Yeah, I'm not signing it. - Chip. - -Mmm. I'm glad I caught you before I left. Left? Heading out so soon? I thought you and Laura would be planning your big day? - Laura and I have decided to - take a break. An indefinite break. Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that. Yeah, Laura's a great girl. And she deserves to be happy. And to be honest, she seemed pretty happy last night talking about banana bread and fixing a drainpipe with you. I don't think I've ever seen her that happy. Anyway, take care, Chip. You too. Come in. I heard what happened. How are you? May I suggest an action plan? One, we eat these cakes. Two, we go to the spa and take advantage of my staff discount. Three, just breathe. I feel like I could just float away. That was the best massage I've ever had. This is exactly what I needed. Thanks, Gem. You're welcome. Well, I cannot believe Graham's birthday celebrations are tomorrow. I think I have everything under control. Graham's birthday and the deadline to get the contract signed. What will you guys do? I truly don't know. He seems so stuck. I just wish I could make this decision about the contract easier for him. He'll never leave the island. - If only there was a way - he could do both. That's it. I mean, we couldn't do it all at once but we could do it. Gem, that's brilliant! Always happy to help. Laura? You awake? Chip, what are you doing down there? I, um, wasn't sure that you'd want to speak to me. Would you want to come on a sunrise hike with me? That sounds like an adventure. It is an adventure. I'll be right down. Hey, um, Laura, I'm really sorry about the other night. What you've done with your career, what you've become, it's really impressive. Sometimes I... I wish I was more like that. Anyway, I'm sorry. It's OK. I'm kind of realizing that work isn't everything. I guess being back on the island gave me a different perspective on things. I kind of feel like I'm home again. Something about this place, I guess, just... This island just helps people see clearly. Must be that island magic. Must be. Home isn't a place. It's a feeling. And, you know, I'm starting to realize what you've been saying about not wanting to leave this place. So I've had an idea. Oh, more reading. Great! Yes, but I've added in a new condition. If you accept the role as CEO, company headquarters will be moved to the island. That way, you don't have to move away and you can keep your charity. Laura... It could take a year or two, but I think that this would work. What do you think? I think I'm running out of excuses. I'm surrounded by CEOs and directors and board members all day long, I know a leader when I see one. You want to use your influence to make the world a better place. Not for personal gain. Do you know how rare that is? It sounds like someone I know. - Did you work - on this all night? Yeah. Well, I am a bit of a nerd so... No. You're incredible. That was worth the hike! Yeah, it was. Coming through. Let's go. Let's go. Lots to do, people. - Important DJ stuff - coming through. - Sam, can you go and load - the truck? - Any more - adventures planned for today? You'll have to wait and see. Watch your back. - Oh, thank goodness you are here. - I really need help. - -Is everything OK? - -Barely. - The flowers arrived and they - were supposed to be - Tropical centerpieces, - but they arrived like this. - I'm so busy overseeing - everything. - Is there any chance that you - would mind... Making some centerpieces? Yes, sure. We would love to. Yeah. You're the best. Where have you two been anyway? Chip took me on a hike and we watched the sunrise. Oh, how romantic. Oh, no, I wouldn't say that it was romantic. - Me neither. They got those - mosquitoes and, and... Yeah, it rained. And it rained a little and... A lot. OK. Just get started. Ow. So what do you know about flower arranging? Oh, don't worry, I'm very experienced in the flower arranging industry. There. So you have no idea what you're doing either. Not at all. OK. This. Uh... That's you. Oh! Oh! It's the office. Today's the deadline. Fiona. Hi. She's alive. Yes. I am. I'm sorry. I've been, uh... distracted. I have some news for you. - Oh? - -The partnership. Simon isn't in the running anymore. Oh! - Send that contract through - with Chip's signature By 5:00 p.m. and the partnership's as good as yours. Understood? Yes. Good. So, everything all right? I got the promotion. I just need to send them the signed contract. - I guess it's - time to make a decision. Chip, can you help Karavi move that chair, please? Yeah. Laura, I need you to lay the table cloths, move those centerpieces. And tell me everything's gonna be OK. Everything's gonna be OK. Great. Wait, are you OK? Not really. But I will be. Come on. So by 1900 hours, you all need to be in formation one circulating drinks and canapés. And then at 1930, you'll move to formation two for dinner service. This is gonna be the greatest night this resort has ever seen. - -Understood? - Yes, ma'am. Sir... I mean, copy that. We're almost there. But it has to be perfect. But why? It's not like your promotion's riding on it. You'll look great in a suit. Yeah, thanks. - Yeah? - -OK, yeah, that sounds great. Ooh! Oh. Hey, let's run the lighting and sound check. - Now? - But it's not even dark yet. Yeah. Just go with me on this. Hey, Chip, Laura, - we need to - do a lighting check. Can you stand in on the dance floor? Please? It's really important. Cue lights. Cue sound. Guys, come on.

Fine. Should have done that years ago. What about Laura continuing to provide our legal services? Agreed! And... And I have quite a lot of thoughts about moving forward. - I'm not gonna be pushing - the same old agenda - That's been driving Finley - Developments all these years. I want to change things. I'd say the company is ripe for a restructure. I trust you, Chip. I always have. You've never wavered from your beliefs. And I want you to make this company exactly what you think it needs to be. It will be your company. Your rules. That's my wish. You know what? Happy birthday, Grandad. I'll try to make you proud. You already do. It's almost 1900 hours. Formation one, everyone. It's go time. - If you're calling - for an update, - I'm afraid I don't have one - for you. Laura, are you kidding? You did it. He signed it? Yes. He signed it. Chip is the new CEO of Finley Developments. - They've sent through - the contract. - It was a bit stained - and ripped up. What happened out there? Never mind. It doesn't matter. He signed it. Congratulations, Laura. Welcome to the partnership. Thank you, Fiona. That's... wonderful. Now, we need to get you back to San Francisco. Tonight. We need to organize that buy-in ASAP - now that you're - an equity partner. Tonight? Yes. Is there a problem? Hi. Welcome. Cue Champagne top-ups. Copy that. Karavi, let's turn the music up just a touch. Whoa! Hmm? - Tell the chef to lighten up - on the seasoning. Any word on our guest of honor? - The Eagle has landed. - I repeat. The Eagle has landed. Happy birthday, Graham. You look very dapper. Good to see you both... Together. - -Excuse me. - -Of course. There's my boy. You look like a man on the way to great things. You don't scrub up so bad yourself, Grandad. Laura! I can see the island has been treating you well. Happy birthday, Mr. Finley. Yes, this has been exactly what I needed. I can't stay... Laura, I... - I hear congratulations - are in order. You are looking at the new CEO of Finley Developments. OK, Champagne now. Copy that. 10-4. - -Oh! - -Thank you. Congratulations, Chip. Perfect. Thank you, Laura. I knew you'd convince him. No doubt they're expediting your promotion as we speak. Yes, they want me to hit the ground running, something about an equity buy-in. This evening, in fact. - They've booked me on - the last flight out tonight. Tonight? I'm afraid I can't stay. I'd better go pack my bags. Have a lovely evening. 30 minutes till dinner service, everyone. 30 minutes. - -Hi. - Hi. Hi! Coming through! Whoo-hoo! Cha-cha-cha! Good evening, Theodore. - -Have you welcomed the VIPs? - -Yes. - And complementary fruit baskets - have been sent to their rooms. - Does the DJ know to keep to - the pre-reviewed song choices? - He does, - though I have this music - Override button - if necessary. - I've also ensured that all - of Graham's favorite items Are on the menu - and the drinks and canapés are - on constant rotation Until dinner begins. - And the lighting is set to dim - at precisely 8:00 p.m. Right before the fireworks. Well, it seems that you've managed everything perfectly. Almost. It appears that you're wearing an incorrect name tag. I think this is more appropriate. Oh, you won't regret this! Are you really going to let her leave like that? You know, I read the contract to get closer to her, but now that I've signed it, I pushed her away. The contract is not the only reason I brought her out here, you know. After all these years, the one thing I've learned is that work isn't everything. You love her. And that's... The beginning and the end of everything. She's leaving, Grandad. Again. She hasn't left yet. She's a high flying, big-city partner at a law firm now. And you're the new CEO of a billion-dollar company. Your worlds are not that far apart anymore. You just have to do what feels right. Here. And I found this in the shed. That's our old treasure map. The necklace. Maybe the old days are exactly what Laura needs. Oh, Grandad. I need a shovel. I need a shovel. Oh! Your taxi will be here any minute. Chip will be so sad that he missed you. The party was perfect. You are amazing. I always knew you'd make general manager. And it's better this way. With Chip. I just can't believe you're leaving now. I'm gonna miss you so much. I have to take this. - -Okay. - -Bye, Gem. I miss you already. Bye. Fiona. Let me know as soon as you land. - Because we need to get straight - into the paperwork. - We've got your promotion - announcement - And marketing - materials to finalize. - And of course, - we want to introduce Our newest partner to our marquee clients. - There's gonna - be some late nights And early mornings involved. - Actually, the first thing - I'd like to do - Is implement - my local business plan. Politics first, Laura. You gotta meet the new CFO of Parker Industries immediately. - Then we need to wine - and dine Gibson Incorporated. - They're a new kid on - the pharmaceutical scene And they are shopping for a new legal team and that's just for starters. Now that you're partner, you gotta jump through a few hoops. Hoops? It's partnership politics. You know how these things work. - Sapphire Cove Airport, - miss? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Perfect. Gem. Have you seen Laura? She wanted to say goodbye. She couldn't find you anywhere. She's gone. Oh, did you just dig that up? Oh, Chip. It wasn't in there. How did you know that? Because it's always been here. I don't understand. How? When we buried the treasure chest, I went back. I couldn't bear to leave without it. Without something to remember you by. - So you've been wearing it - all these years? It's my lucky charm. Chip, I'm done jumping through hoops. I want to start my own law firm. Here. On the island. I want the sunsets. And horseback riding and adventures. And I want my best friend to be there beside me. What do you think? You're my best friend. And I love you, Laura. I love you too.
