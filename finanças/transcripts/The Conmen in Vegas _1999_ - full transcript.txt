LAS VEGAS SAUNA Nobody Is going to take my pride Nobody Is going to hold me down - Long... - Hey! Why are you singing? - Do you want to be a singer? - No. I think the lyrics of this song are very meaningful and prideful. - Singing it fires up my spirit! - I see. Do you know that you are hurting my ears? What are we doing tonight? - Tonight? - Yes. We are going to kill Big Eye Man. I have the whole plan set up already. It's a good plan! Goodness! Master, why do you look like shit today? Why? Cheer up! My sister is weird, all of a sudden she wanted to go study. Let her be! It's okay to go study. But she's studying something like forest management. That is weird. We always say this when we're chasing after girls, "Don't give up the whole forest for one tree." Yes, you got the forest, but you need someone to take care of it. What? Do you want to know the truth? To be honest, my sister dumped you already, forget about it. Her first love lives in Canada. He is six feet and four inches tall and looks like Leonardo DiCaprio. - Okay. - You are almost 40 years old already. You'll start losing your sexual ability in two years. Your eyesight is poor. - You're old and penniless. - Okay. - My sister will commit suicide for sure. - Enough! Goodness! You don't have to be this straight! You don't like it? Nobody Is going to take my pride Big Eye Man, are we going to play Big Two? I didn't gamble on horse races because you said there is a loser coming. Hold it! I won again! The three of us are waiting for him. I don't know him that well. That's right! I've almost finished my supper and he's not here yet. - Boss. - What is it? - A guy named King wants to come in. - Bring him in. That guy is here. Thanks. Let me introduce you. This is Nat. - Hello, Nat. - This is Dragon. - Hello, Dragon. - So, what's your name? - My name is King. - He's King. What king? Who do you think you are? - You want to lose this quickly? - Enough! Let's play! Let's all be polite now. This place is famous for being fair. So, we'll bet with cash. I'm a man of my word. If anyone cheats, he will have to leave a hand here. - Understand? - I know! Do you think I'm a rookie? Let's begin! Roll the dice! Wait! How much does a card cost? This is our first time playing. Three thousand dollars each, okay? Hurry. I don't have the three of diamonds. Whoever has it, discard it now. I have it. I will go first. Three of a kind and a king? - Pass! - Anyone? Luckily, my straight flush can beat him. - Anyone? - Wait! Mine is just a little bigger than yours. Such bad luck on the first hand. - Pass! - Pass! - Pass! - We'll continue then. A pair of six. I have pairs. I have Big Two. I'm sorry. Both of you lost fourfold. You lost 150,000 dollars! Did you bring enough money? For the past few years, today's bet is the lowest bet. You go first. - One four! - One card? You have lots of big cards, a six. One nine! - One nine! - Wait! What is the matter with you? My nine is bigger than yours. - Goodness! - It's my mistake! Screw you, take it back! I will use my two of hearts, okay? - Who has the Big Two? - I have it. You don't have to be in such a rush! I really have to use my cards. I got an ace full house. What the hell? You can use your good cards now. My best cards were used, no one can beat an ace full house. I got all the good cards. Five of a kind! This sucks! Hundred thousand dollars again? What did you do last night? - Did you forget to wash your damn hands? - Shut up, you have to pay too! - Then why haven't you done so? - You're the same! Thanks. - Wait! - What's wrong? Kid, I think you are cheating. Don't talk nonsense! I didn't cheat! I'll show you my cards. If I am, why'd I deal such bad cards to myself? Really? You gave this white haired guy all the good cards. Look at these cards! Don't blame me! I don't know him! Do you know him? Take it easy. Just shut up and put all the money in here. Hey, you're breaking the rules! What rules? They cheated! All rules are useless now. - Put it in there. - Don't get mad! You too! - Hurry up! I want everything! - What do you want? Get over to that table! Put all the money in there. You better be quick! Don't move! He's dead! Oh no! - You killed him. - Really? Take this. I will go first. - What now? - Let's go! Okay. What now? Take this. I'll go check it out. - Boss, where are you? - What's the matter? I'm going to Shenzhen. Don't leave! We got tricked by three conmen! Damn it! Cheers! There are so many fools in this world. With our brains, we will be rich for sure! So if you work with us, we will be rich for sure! I don't think so. Men aren't that simple. - I think we should go abroad and hide. - Master! Please respect me. When you talk to me, can you look at me, please? Speaking of going abroad, why don't we go to Las Vegas? You know, I think I have too much money, I want to have fun! - Too much money? - Right! Why don't you lose your money to me? Let's play Big Two. Are you kidding? You want me to win? You guys go ahead, I will go read this novel over there. - What? Come on! - I hope you win a lot! I'm happy that you want to play Big Two with me. Do you know that there is a song about Big Two? That's my song. Ace and king are seeding me. Massage money comes from straight and flush. The car payment relies on the full house. A Big Two can support the whole family. I'm worried about you. You're awesome! Deal the cards, please. LU FENG Three of diamond goes first. What are you looking at? Three of diamond goes first. Three of a kind. I will pass. Your turn. Look at it, full house. Why do you have all the small cards? Not five cards again, right? Small straight, you lose fourfold! Crazy! - I will go first. - Wait! - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What are you looking at? - None of your business. Let's play! A pair of three. What? Are you going to pass? A pair of four. You don't have a pair? A pair of five! A pair of six! A pair of eight! You really don't have a pair? Are they all small cards? I have only one card left. - It's your turn to lose fourfold. - Crazy! - Where is Dragon? - Master! - What's wrong? - Not good! I saw a girl and her tits are this big. But she is different from the other girls. She is very cute and active. Everybody loves her! Where is she? She's here! Where is the karaoke? Over there! - You pervert! - Come here! Hurry, why are you so slow? Why are you so mean to people? When a man sees a girl with big breasts, he will get horny. If you don't be meaner, they will take advantage of you! We came to Hong Kong to make money, right? I remember all the rich men's faces I saw in the newspaper. Do the three assholes look like rich men? I just came back from the States, I'm Li Ka Shing's third son. - My name is Lukchard Nat. - I see. You're the third person I met today who claimed he is Li Ka Shing's son. So who's the real son? - So which of these is real? - Asshole! Let's go! - You are mean! - This is real cash! - Kill them! - Kill them! - Run! - That one! - Kill them! - Run! - Kill them! - Run! Master, let's split up! - That's them! - Don't run! - Get them! - Don't let him get away! - Kill him! - Hurry! This Big Eye Man is something! Even the police are on his side. - Stop! - Stop right there! - Hey! - Pervert! - Don't move! - How dare you con my boss! Stop right there! - Stop right there! - Let's jump! Why did you tell me to jump? We jumped into their net! - Why didn't you jump far? - I jumped farther than you! - We jumped into their net! - Shut up! If I didn't come back to save you, I wouldn't have been caught! Officer. Officer! Why did you put me in here? There's a crab on your head. The crab is something! It's amazing to see him alive. Officer. Officer! No matter what you're going to charge me with, you shouldn't put me in here. Has anyone told you that you look like Leon Lai? - No! - That's the point! You don't look like him at all! Sir, I think you're their boss. Why did you bring me here? King, we didn't want to arrest you. Someone wants to see you. But we don't want to know anything at all. Do you understand? No, I don't. You'll understand once you enter that room. No one's here. Come in! I am Mr. Jiang. Please have a seat. Why do Hong Kong police speak Mandarin? I am not with the police. I am a Central Intelligence agent from China. He's got more power than a commander. But it works differently here. I don't have power here. King. I've picked you out from 200 other candidates. I hope you will do something for your country. - I'm just a gambler. - Right! You're exactly what we need! Take a look at this. MILITARY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT OF CHINA This is Peter Chu. Three years ago, he appeared as a trustworthy constructor in China. He signed several main projects. But after all the flood, we discovered that all the buildings he built were badly constructed. Because they were work of cut corners! A large amount of the country's money was stolen. Give him a death sentence then! All the officers whom he bribed, have all been prosecuted. Only he got away and fled to America. He also fled with four billion RMB! Take a look at this. Peter Chu loves gambling so much that he rented a presidential suite in Las Vegas Casino. He has been hiding there since. American gangsters and politicians are backing him up. We tried to send men to go arrest him for three times. - None of them made it back. - You want us to be your fourth try? If you can get Peter Chu alive, send him back here to Hong Kong, and take back the money that he stole from our country, we will give you two percent of it as your reward. You want us to risk our lives for 80 million dollars? - Goodbye! - What? Have you made deal with them? The police suspects that you are involved in illegal gambling, assault, cheating, and also stealing an old lady's underwear. We have to detain you for 48 hours. Do you prefer this room or the detention cell? See? The police are really powerful! DRAGON: I WAS CAUGHT AND WILL BE KILLED SOON. PLEASE CALL ME IMMEDIATELY. Make the call! Hello. Where is Dragon? Speak, God of Gambler! Nobody Is going to take my pride Nobody Is going to hold me down Master, don't worry about me. After I die, just burn me a paper girl with big tits. Where are you? - I'm at... - King! Dragon is in my hand! Get me 30 million dollars or your friend will die. I don't have 30 million dollars. - Why aren't you tracing the call? - Okay. Hurry up! - Yes! - Yes! - Give me some time. - Anything you want to say? Master, please imagine, when you marry my sister and I'm not going to be there, it will be too bad. It's only 30 million dollars, you can get that money easily. I will cheer for you, listen. Nobody Is going to take my pride Enough! Master. - Where is Big Eye Man? - One week. You will have to report to me every day or we will cut off his hand. Big Eye Man, if you lay one finger on Dragon, you'll pay for it. You look like you need some money. Okay! I agree to take the deal. But I want three percent! - Which is 120 million dollars. - That is not a big problem. But if anything happens in America, we and the Hong Kong police will not be responsible for anything. We don't care what you do. But I will support you spiritually! We really are going to Las Vegas this time! Wait. Let's see who is tougher! Let's go. Las Vegas is so big, where are we going to find Peter Chu? I found them! What? The beautiful girls by the pool! How's that related to Peter Chu? I didn't say I found Peter Chu. I said I found the two girls. Who said that Hong Kong people are not reliable? Taiwanese are worse. They told us to meet them here, but where are they now? We took a 20-hour long flight for nothing. He said that he is the son of Koo Chen Fu and studied with Ma Ying Jeou. Since we came from the same town, I believed him! We have used up our money, what should we do? So what? We got the necessary tools to make money! Hi, ladies! We meet again! Don't tell me you're Li Ka Shing's son! Don't tell anyone else. I am his illegitimate son. - Are you really his son? - Of course! So what? I am staying in Caesars Palace. Where are you staying? We are staying in Caesars Palace too. - Really? - Yes! I think you two must be very lonely. - Why don't we go there together? - Okay! - Take their luggage. - Let's go! - What is your name? - My name is Sammi. - What about you? - Betty. - What is your name? - My older brother is called Victor, the other is called Richard, and my name is Lukchard! - Lukchard? - Lukchard? - It's so beautiful! - So cool! So real! Hey! Your boss is such a pervert! If he's not, how can you make money from him? Hey, want to have a look? - Yes! - Get closer. - Very good! - Very beautiful! It's so big! Give me some space. - Look over there! - What? - So beautiful! - This is great! - That looks cool! - Yes! Over here! What now? Here. That guy looks like he's something. Why don't we play with the girls before we look for Peter Chu? You ass... You can't say that word! - I'm allergic to that! - What do you mean? I'll go crazy! I won't be able to control myself too. It's very scary! Whatever next to me will suffer. So just don't! - Okay. - Asshole! What's going on? He's so mean! He's so manly! I didn't mean it. I didn't expect you to be like this. What are you guys doing? He works for me, I can do whatever I want! Let's go. You're so manly! Go to your room, take a shower and wait for me. What are we doing now? Go to the room and get ready. - Let's go. - Get ready for what? One? I hate it when beggars walk in front of me. It ruins my concentration. That's great! I love to steal from the beggars. What is the matter with you? Your breath stinks. It's better than yours. Let's play! Chips, please. I just want one chip. I will bet 10,000 dollars on the player. 50,000 dollars on the player. You can't look at the cards. No card? 100,000 dollars! I'll fold this round! Have fun! One? Banker opens. Picture! Is it a picture? It's a two. You only have a three, you'll lose for sure. That idiot lost 100,000 dollars because he wanted to look at the cards. What a stupid decision! I will bet 100,000 dollars on the banker. I want to bet on the player. Zero! Eight? Shit! It's a ten! No! I made a mistake! It's a seven. - Seven, I have eight! - So what? - If I get nine you will lose! - We'll see! Picture! - Picture! - Picture! Shut the hell up! It's all your fault again. We lost again! You lost again? - Congratulations! - Shut up! Player. Banker. Banker. Player. - Which one are you going to bet on? - I'm asking you. - I'll bet on the banker. - I'll bet on the player then. You are trying to go against me! Of course, you have such bad luck. Read the chart for me. Zero! Five! Seven is enough to shut you up. It's okay! This time, we'll win for sure! - Nine? What the hell? - Zero again? - What kind of card is this? - Wait! The card is yours! How do I know what happened? No need! He must be a conman! You're saying I cheated? Peter, what should we do now? How the hell would I know? - Why are you so mean? - How dare you talk back to me! Did you just hit me? Wait, beautiful. Don't leave! There are lots of rich men in this world. You can come with me if you want. What did you say? I have nothing but guts! So what if I try to get your girl? - Dragon, collect the money for me. - Yes. Sir your ass! I'm your VIP member! VIP my ass! Sit your ass down! You're good! I'm nothing. I work for him. - I like you. - Thanks. I don't like you. Don't cry. Lukchard loves you. Where do you want to go? Let's go to your room!

Let me show you. Is it cute? It's very cute! Do you know where the other one is? - How would I know? - Here! Wait! Why the rush? I need to warm up first. Really? I can take care of it.

This is too exciting! I haven't touched you yet, why did you twist my nipple? Hey, again? Not bad, your nipples are elastic! I can't take it anymore! Now you're using a weapon. Can we stop playing? Again? How come all men love to have sex? Oh, Carol Everybody is naked Showing their dicks How does it feel? Is my girl good or not? Hey man, give me a chance! People like you are really something! You are so stupid. How dare you mess with me! You're finished this time. My hit man, Dragon, is deadly. He's next door. He thought that you were having fun, so he took off already. I heard that you like Mickey Mouse. How do you know? Look! I heard everything! So I purposely prepared a special Mickey Mouse gift for you. You don't have to be so nice. - You are so kind. - Take a look. You don't have to go this far. Wait! Have you seen a Mickey Mouse cake made out of shit? Have you tasted it before? I added vanilla for you. Help! You cheater just love to sneak into people's room. Thanks for your help! I just ate shit! Just because you're black, it doesn't mean I can't see you. Stay still!

We have two girls. They're useless! They can't fight. We need someone who can fight. Why don't I get the director who helped me in Hong Kong? Back in Hong Kong? No, he's working in Hollywood now, his name is Woo. I know him too, John Woo, right? - No! His name is Handsome Woo! - Really? - We're here. - Yes. Does that fat boy really work in Hollywood? Yes! What's wrong with Hollywood? Check this out. What kind of movie company is this? I think it's an X-rated movie company. Handsome! King, you came to visit me? You're really a director in Hollywood? A small-time director. I'm working in there! What is the movie called? Didn't John Woo direct that movie already? Sorry, it's Fuck Off! Really? It's going to start soon. Are you making an X-rated movie? No. It's a triple X-rated movie. This company has a great future. It's called Dickyland. I am going to build a Dickyland in Hong Kong soon and be rich. So he's the one who came to Hollywood - and made movies. - Yes. The Hong Kong directors come here to make C-rated movies. X- rated movie can make more money. I make over ten movies a year. Later, I'll make a movie called The Pen and I. Then I will make Shakespeare in Make Love. After that, I will make a blockbuster. Leonardo Dilaluim will star in Ti Land Wook! That's awesome! Hey! I need your help. I will pay you double this time. You are my good friend, I will do my best. But I have to take care of him first. Please wait. Stand back. What is that thing between that guy's legs? - It looks like a spoiled fried churro. - No! It's a rice roll. You are right! It looks like fried food. No reaction whatsoever. Get your useless dick up! Hey, help him out! They can't understand Chinese. Right! - Hey, come and help. - You're something! Handsome, I came here because I want you to find me a hot girl to seduce a fool. If I have one, then his thing would be up for sure. Hey there, little guy. Can you please stand up for me? Don't look! Why are you still searching for a beautiful girl? She's perfect! - Can she do it? - Of course! Look! Why do you want us to watch X-rated movies? I'm not asking you to watch it, I want you to act in it. I don't want to do it! Shut up! 100,000 USD! Who do you think we are? 200,000 dollars! I will pay you! I want to be the main actor! It's not really for an X-rated movie. I just want you to seduce Peter Chu. I want you to seduce him to sleep with you. I don't know how to seduce people! Hey! He is so rich. Why does he need to con people? He is so mean, we want to trick him a little. Yes! All girls know how to do this. Maybe you don't do this often. Why not... I will be Peter Chu. Try to seduce me. If you do something wrong, I'll tell you. Let me do it! - Okay. - No! This is not important. Something more important is waiting for me. - Really? - Feed the crab. - You mean it? - I will go feed the crab! Hey! Come on! Let's do it! No way! How can she be this good? It's fine! This is only a normal reaction of a man. That's right, just think of her as someone I don't like. That's it! Someone I don't like. Then... Your shirt. How can you seduce me like that! It's okay, Dragon is not here right now. No one will know what happened. Someone delivered you a tape. Who? Let's take a look. PAY UP Master. Please pay them. Hello. I didn't answer the phone. It's for you! Hello? After you watch this tape, you will die. No, Dragon will die. - Don't forget to pay. - Hello? Hello? Hello? They hung up already. There's not much time left. Let's get to work. Wait! What now? I'm scared. What for? I have taught you for couple days already. Give me a nine Okay? An eight is okay too Eight or nine is fine I'm not doing this! I don't want to be with him! Hey! Hey. What now? What's wrong? If you don't want to do it, why didn't you tell me earlier? We have the whole plan set up already. What are you doing here? Do you like me? Of course! You're gorgeous, of course I like you! Right? Do you know that I fell for you when we met at the pool? When I saw you again at the airport, I was so happy, no words can describe my feelings! Do you like me? Of course! You are so beautiful, of course I like you. If you like me, why are you sending me to seduce that man? It's for work. You're getting paid. What if he rapes me? Won't you be sad? It won't happen! We're looking after you! It'll be fine. I'm doing this for you. Does it work? I'm quite experienced. I know that falling in love with you means nothing good. But it's too tiring to do this when you're in love. Just kidding. You're so old. Why are you here? Not bad. When will you teach me how to kiss a girl? Do you want me to kick your ass? I saw everything. Am I a bad person? No. There is no good or bad in relationships. The only thing that matters is how deep the love is. If she likes you, she will even sacrifice herself for you. But you don't need her to do that. Thanks. Get to work. Beautiful. Are the cards really that good? Very beautiful! Extremely beautiful. Even if it's a picture? Look, you won. Beautiful, aren't you happy? I will bet on the player this round. Here, player! I like your personality. You lost. You'll win if you listen to me and bet on the player. Why don't you - take these chips? - I don't want it! I knew you were here. Who gave you permission? - You got a bad temper. - I learned it from you. Don't touch my woman! Go back to your room! What a punk! A beautiful girl is with this dickhead. Forget it! No more games. Let's go watch magic shows. Bravo! It's those two dickheads again. They don't match at all. You, go! Just go! Come on, give her a round of applause! Me! Asshole! That's enough, everyone. Otherwise, I'll get cocky. I've always wanted to hit a tiger, but now I've killed one. Thank you! Hey, beautiful! Have some wine. - Call me Betty. - Betty? What a cute name! When I was little, they called me Dicky. Now, they call me Big Dick. You are so beautiful. Why are you with that asshole? He is a gangster in Hong Kong. My whole family is controlled by him. So what? The most powerful gangsters in the world are in America. But they are stupid. They go around and cause troubles. But they're afraid to fight one to one. All they do is spend tons of money to shoot missiles at people. If they change that money into coins and throw it, all the people in Yugoslavia will die. You are well educated! Of course. Hey. Stop being with that asshole. Come with me. I'll take that as a yes since you drank the wine. I will give you a gift. Wait for me. Leave! Will we have sex tonight? Of course! Who is it? Why did you come in here? I have told you many times. I don't want to be bothered when I open the safe. If I press it wrong three times, the safe will release a strong heat and destroy everything in there. You remember the password better than your ID number! - How will you press it wrong? - Press it wrong? Sit tight! I waited a year for you to give me this ring but you never did. But now you are going to give it to that bitch! Don't forget. I helped you get that four billion! Shut up! Do you want to hit me again? If I don't want it, no one can touch me. You... You look so pretty when you're angry. I'm a man, it's normal for me to have sex with a woman. You are my first wife. Be generous! Let her wear this and be happy for a couple of days. After I'm tired of her, I will take the ring back for you. - You better keep your promise! - I swear! - If I lie, I will be used as a human bomb. - Stop it! Be good, don't get mad. Sit here and rest. Look after the safe for me! Do you like it? Is this for me? Don't go back tonight. I can't do that. He will kill my parents. Your parents will die someday anyway. Right? Why don't I go buy tickets for tomorrow night's show? I will sneak out to meet you after the show starts. Good! And come here. No way! But I know a small motel in this area. He knows too many people here. I don't want to be noticed. You're going to cheat on him? This is so exciting! I like it! Which motel? Bye! Go, go, go! Ale, ale, ale! Are we going to have sex tonight? I love sex! How was it? I got him. We're meeting tomorrow night at 11 at that motel. That's great! We will give him a shot after we capture him. When he is dizzy, we'll take him back to Hong Kong. I heard that he has four billion dollars in his safe. Did you hear it wrong? Four billion dollars? Betty, what are you talking about? - Nothing. - Hey. Didn't you just say that he has four billion dollars? They can get four billion dollars for this job? It's gonna be a lot of money if I exchange it to Taiwan dollar. I don't care! I contributed as well. What are you talking about? Are you threatening us? She lied and you believe her? Crazy! - Sammi! - Don't talk to me. I know! You three are scheming. You guys are going to leave me out. I know. You guys always look down on me. Am I right? I'm not important at all. Okay. I've been useless all this time! I've never been part of this after all! I'm leaving! I'm leaving for real! Sammi! - Don't mind her. - Why did you let her go? Let's see how far she can go. Let's go. What are you doing? I heard everything you just said. Do you want to go to my room and have a drink? - No! - Are you interested? Is it a five-carat diamond? It's seven and a half carat! You're giving it to me? They know I have four billion dollars and want to take me back to Hong Kong. Do you know what other plans they have for me? I heard that they want to capture you at that motel. Don't tell them that I told you this. No way! Don't worry. So? We're here. This is the motel. What's going on? The three of them are in there. What is this? It's a heat detector. The temperature of a human body is around 100 Fahrenheit. It can be detected through walls. We have to be alert. When Peter Chu starts taking a shower, we will tie him up and take him back to Hong Kong. Let me kick his ass first. I'm scared. How can we be scared right now? Let's get some rest first. They really want to capture me. So, do you believe me now? - Fix them! - Got it. Do it cleanly. What are you going to do to them? Nothing! I'll just throw them into a blender and turn them into sausages. Are you kidding? You better be good and listen to me. If it wasn't for your nice body, you'd become a sausage too! Take off that ring! Are you sure? Here you go! I'll burn your dick if you disturb me when I'm making love! Sorry! I should speak English. Hello, conman! How are you? Security! No! Please don't hit my face. Do you think you're handsome? I told you not to hit my face. Why are you here? Who were the people at the hotel? You guys got tricked! You think that equipment can track us? It won't work! Damn! Go back! The safe is here! Open the safe! I won't! I dare you to kill me. Just use his fingerprint. It's not that simple. There must be a password. - We can guess. - Try guessing then. If you get it wrong three times, the safe will release a strong heat, and it will burn everything in there. I don't care about it. But you guys will be here for nothing. Don't be cocky! What now? Do you think it will be okay if you don't answer the phone? Let me tell you, I have a habit. If I don't answer the call, they'll know that something is wrong and come to my rescue! Get up! Let me tell you, you better work with us. - If not, I will kill you right now. - You won't. It won't do you any good if you kill me. Who touched my ass? Me! There! The car is over there! Where is the driver? - Driver? - Yes, where's the driver? - Didn't you get a driver? - You don't have to be so mean! I'll drive. But why didn't you hire a driver? So what, didn't you say that you are going to drive? It's fine if I can drive. But I can't drive a manual car. So what? It's still a car. The manual car is way harder to drive. But now the problem is I only have a driving license for automatic cars. - What? - That's why I don't get it. Why didn't you hire a driver when you rented this car? I don't know how to drive this car. Come out! Why are you so mean? Why do you have a useless driver license? Automatic driving license? Don't be so mean! I only learned the automatic transmission! - You are so mean, why don't you drive? - I drive? Do you know who I am? Why would I drive? Enough, they're almost here! - You drive! - I won't! This is against my principal! How can you not hire a driver when you rented the car? This is inexcusable. I have to punish you! You guys drive it. I don't know how to drive! What is the matter with you? Why can't you just drive? I don't know how to drive. - What? - I don't have a driving license. I was over 30 when I was released from jail and had no time to learn it. Goodness! It's too funny, I couldn't pretend to be unconscious anymore. I can't take it anymore. What are you laughing at? Why don't you drive then? Me? I can't. I just can't drive. Let's take a cab. Look after him, I will go buy the ticket! Do you know how to hold a gun? Be careful with the gun! You might pull the trigger. It's fine, only you would die from it. Back off! Nat! Nat! - His men are here. - What should we do now? I don't know. Why are you sitting on him? - Get up! - Get up! Why are they here? - Why? - You guys want money, right? I'll give you guys a couple of million, okay? - Bunch of silly kidnappers! - Silly kidnappers? Don't hit me! Don't hit my nose! - My nose is fake! - Damn you! Then what should we do now? - We don't have to take a plane. - Go! I think we'll reach Los Angeles in three hours. But we are in the middle of a desert. We didn't ask you to walk. Hey, can we have a deal? Do you want to have a deal? Talk to my boss. Do you think I'm a fool? You are their boss. If you release me, I'll give you 800 million dollars. What? 800 million dollars? Then we'll have 200 million dollars each. Think about it. The person who sent you to arrest me won't be able to pay this amount. It's 800 million dollars! If you release me now, I'll pay you immediately. You will pay right away? I am a man of my word. I will trust you! Why did you hit him so hard? My nose is fake! Look, it's bleeding! Let me beat him up! He's such an eyesore. It's a fake gun! Hey! Asshole! Stop messing around, or I will kill you. You won't kill me. If you kill me, all of your efforts will go to waste. If we kill him, Dragon will be dead. I see now! So you need money to save your brother. Then you just can't kill me now. And you better treat me well. If you let me go just now, I would've given you 800 million dollars. Now I won't give you a penny. I can't let you go, but I can kick your ass! - You dickhead! - Hey! We can't take this bus anymore. The driver will call the police. Let's walk. Walk? This is a desert. Pervading Heaven and Earth Is a righteous spirit You two are bastards! I was enjoying my life in Caesars Palace. But now I have to walk in this damn desert! Why didn't we just follow the highway? Isn't that the same as driving the bus? In the end, we will get arrested by the police. After we cross this desert, we will be there. - In four days. - Four days? We won't get there even after four days, you asshole! What are you doing? - Stop! - Is he crazy? - Stop! - Why you did you hit me so hard? - Don't ever say that word again! - What word? Don't you say the word "asshole" again. Or he will lose control again. - It's fine! - How strange. It's fine. We can't continue like this. You can but I can't. My life is very valuable. If this continues, we will either die of thirst or fatigue. There are many venomous snakes here. You'll die after 30 minutes if you get bitten by one of them. If other snakes bite us, we will die in 15 minutes. Look! - Snake! It's over there! - There's no such coincidence. Watch out! Stop messing around! Who bit my ass? Who is it? Who is it? I wish I was playing Baccarat. I got two in a row. Let's wait for the snake to leave. It looks like he's been poisoned. He is indeed poisoned! He will surely die in half an hour. Unless someone sucks the poison for him. - Let's be fair and vote. - Okay! One, two, three! - I vote you! - I vote you! - All of you voted me? - Yes. - You guys are bullying me. - No! We're not. If you do it, I'll give you an extra ten million dollars. Ten million dollars? - But on one condition. - What? Don't you dare mention this again. - If not our friendship is over. - Of course. - Okay? - Yes. - Let's tell Dragon about this. - Hey! - I told you not to mention it! - I didn't. Hurry up! Pervading Heaven and Earth Is a righteous spirit Don't treat me like a maid. You are so heavy! Can you come down and walk by yourself? I am hurt and you don't even feel sorry for me? I think I'm suffering more than you. Are my lips okay? They feel tight. They're fine! Really? Hey! - What's the matter? Hurry up! - Hurry up! Are my lips okay? - Yes. - It's fine. Do you have lip balm? - They feel tight. - No. - Do you have a mirror? - No. Let me have a look. - Don't move. - Let's go! - Let's go! - Hey! - I can't stand it! - Hurry up! - Carry me, I am hurt. - You're annoying! Look! There will be a gas station if we walk further to the west. We walked towards the west many times already, but we didn't see any. - I'm just following the map! - Hey! - Forget it! Don't get mad. - Are my lips okay? - They're fine. - They're fine. - They feel tight! - It's your illusion. Then is that an illusion? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Yes! There is a restaurant! - We can get something to eat! - Shit! I don't have any money. I left my wallet on the bus. Don't look at me. I never carry cash with me. Do we look like we have money on us? I always rely on my boss. Why would I have money? I knew it! You guys are all beggars! Shut the hell up! Stop talking nonsense! You better thank me for being here. Don't worry! Peter Chu is here, we can eat anything we want. Asshole! Shut up. In the end, I still had to pull out the gun. You guys started eating already? Yes, help yourself! There are lots of food here! Eat up! Don't just eat! Go get the money in the cashier. Get some cash first! Don't just eat! Take it! Asshole! Don't run! Wait for me! - What are you doing? - Let's see how far you can run! Get up! Get up! Get up! - I can't take it anymore! - What's wrong? Come here! - Enough! - Look after him! He will die! Continue. - Help him up. - How are you? I can't feel my lower body. - Let me take a look. - Get up first. Let me see. - It's a rattlesnake! - What? What's happening? There's a snake! There's a snake! What? - Hey! - What? When did you tattoo a pregnant Mickey Mouse on your ass? Is it swelling badly? Why don't you suck out the poison for me? Me? - Peter Chu, come here! - I'm going to faint! - I can't take it anymore! - Don't lie! - I'm going to faint. I'm going to die. - What should we do now? There is only one solution. What is it? - You die. - You can't be real! - Aren't you loyal to your friends? - I can suck it out for you. But I'll kill you after that. Make your choice. Well... Can you find something that can suck out the poison for me? I'll try! Pervading Heaven and Earth Is a righteous spirit This is worst than Journey to the West When can we go home? I'm going to kick your ass. Pick up your pace! People say that when you're tired, you will likely see illusions. Look, it's a tornado! No, you're wrong. It's cotton candy! - It doesn't seem like it. - Forget it, let's go. Look, someone is filming! It's an illusion. - It's real! - It's Handsome! - Handsome? - It's Handsome! Suck it! Handsome! King! - Handsome! - How come you know I'm here? - No, it's just a coincidence. - It's water! - It's water! - It's water! - It's water! - It's water! Let me introduce you, this is Leonardo Dilaluim. Hey, nice to meet you! She is Kelly. It looks like your actress is good at sucking. Can she suck for me? Suck him, okay? Not here, suck my ass! Can you take us to Los Angeles? I have to finish this movie! Look... Why don't you drive there yourself? - Where is the car? - There! - Makeup trailer. - What kind of transmission is this? - Automatic transmission. - That's great! - Thank you. - Have a safe trip! High five! Hey! Let's get in the car! Hey! Little crab, you can't die. We can't go on without you. You are my lucky charm. If we get through this, I will take care of you for life. What about me? You will get your share. You won't take care of me? I have a girlfriend. It's okay. Just don't tell her. You're okay with that? Why not? If you take me back, you will get over one billion dollars. Everyone gets a share that's worth over a few hundred million. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Tricking your friend and the girl. When you take me back, I will need to return the four billion that I have stolen. According to the rules, you will at least get half of it. It's 80 million dollars, right? Each of us gets 20 million dollars. Don't listen to him. You will get 20 million dollars. But he'll get two billion dollars! Are you finished? Do you want me to shut up? Fine. But they have brains to think. However, that driver can be tricked easily. But these two girls are very smart. Do you think they will trust you? If you were them, can you stand it? Hey! What? - You believe him? - I am 40 years old. No, I am 20 years old. No one dared to trick me before. Just say it! Okay. - Hit me then! - Fine! You asshole! How dare you frame King! How dare you try to hurt our friendship? You trick our girls. You gave us aphrodisiac. You made us do bad stuff. No, I didn't! You deserve this beating! Enough! If you continue, he will die. His nose is fake! I have to kick his ass to please myself. Here, I'll give you a kiss. Where? The lips. That's better. - Okay? - Stop messing around! Go and drive. Go drive the car! - King, are you okay? - Who did this? Don't die! You don't have to stay with me anymore! I'm okay. I'm fine. Shit! What the hell? The crab died but you are still alive. Are you okay? What's going on? - Two helicopters are chasing after us. - Really? Drive the car! Hey, get down! Go to hell! You're trying to capture me? I'm here! Hey! - Come over here! - Drive side to side! Can't you see it? I can't see it! Am I going side to side? Are you blind? I am going to shoot you all. You won't get a penny from me. You don't have to go this far! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! I am alive! - I am still alive! - How are you? What? What about those two assholes? - They're being beaten up downstairs. - Good! Kick the shit out of them! So, how does it feel, my friends? Do you like it? When are you going to die? That's none of your business, conman. Do you want to capture me? Beat me? Got me bitten by a snake. Where are the two girls? They're in the hospital, one of them had a severe injury. - You won't get away, you conman! - Why are you talking so much? The FBI is starting to investigate this. We should go to Mexico. They have no laws there. Go get ready. I'll go upstairs. - Don't ever let them leave! - Got it! Sorry! I can't help you. Sorry! I got you into this. Go to hell! Why do you guys talk so much? This is not a drama! Trying to steal my money? Fei Fei! Fei Fei! Damn it! What is going on? Why is it like this? What's happening? Do you still think that you're in Las Vegas? We fooled you! - It is only a set. - What set? What set? Let me go! Let me go! Why are you arresting me? I have four billion dollars, who dares to arrest me? - That was before, not now. - Why? We set up the place to steal your code. When you were opening your safe, the FBI saw your code already. - They have opened your safe. - You... Sir, the FBI in the States said it's all done. Good! What is this place? Shenzhen. You'll be executed in China, asshole. Asshole? Who are you? I'm your father! Master, Nat. I saved him for you, I'll deduct three million dollars. You wish! Don't you dare pay me one penny less! You guys are good! Fei Fei, how come you are with them? Sorry! I am a witness now. I am going to point you out. They promised to let me have this ring. You sold me out! Where are my men? Look. How come they are all Chinese? Sorry! They are all in jail in the States. Let me introduce a man to you. A famous Hollywood X-rated movie director, Handsome Woo. How do you like the helicopter stunts? Special stunts? Everything was fake? Of course! If it was real, many people would have been hurt! Gosh! Pervading Heaven and Earth is a righteous spirit. You two are bastards! Assholes! Peter Chu finally fell into my trap. This feeling is better than gaining four billion dollars. This feeling is like... When Sheringham, Solskjaer, Beckham, and Schmeichel of Manchester United won the treble. King! - I want to introduce two people to you. - Who? I hired these two ladies from Taiwan, to help you secretly. I'm sorry. We were just following orders. I understand. About the things that you said to me by the pool, was it real? I was just kidding, you're too old for me. I'm sorry! We lied to you for so long. We're leaving, bye! I finally fell into her trap. This feeling is like... Beckham's red card in the World Cup. Master. I hope you won't cry. Someone left a note for you. She will wait for you at the door. - Why did you look at people's note? - I didn't mean to. It's you? This time, I'll swallow you up! Miss! Miss, how much for a night? Subtitle translation by Angel Choo
