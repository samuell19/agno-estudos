1943: the Netherlands is suffering under German occupation. PASTORAL 1943 It has been a long time now and a romanticized view of the war... PASTORAL 1943 PASTORAL 1943 PASTORAL 1943 Of good Dutch people, heroically fighting the Germans. Such brave Dutchmen did exist. But not everybody could be like that. In 1945, Simon Vestdijk wrote this story about it. The story of a people. A friendly people, because... ...it has few heroes. You wanted to pay, sir? -No, we wanted to order something. A shame how Germans ruin nature. -It won't help Hitler. Orange! You're a loyal patriot. I'm looking for an address where people can go into hiding. Jews? -Boys who don't want to work in Germany. It's difficult. I might know something. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. -Agreed. Hello, wife. -Sicherheitsdienst, come along. You can stay. Mr Van Dale, why are you so anti-German? As an engineer, you know that we can do anything... ...to make you talk. You know that, don't you? You have visitors, Mr Schults. Good people. In your room. Cohen. Arie Cohen Kaz. -Schulz? Johan Schulz? These days, I prefer to call myself Schults. I understand. I need help, Schults. Amsterdam's no longer safe. Anne and the children have already been arrested. I have to hide somewhere. This is the best hiding place. Try to find the entrance. You can sleep here tonight. I've got booze here too. You can go in. -Not until I have to. At least you know the way. We'll find something else tomorrow. I know a farm across the river. This has to stay between us. Aren't you exaggerating? You have nothing to fear. You're a German teacher and from a German family. I have more reason to be afraid. And actually... I am. PHARMACY H. POERSTAMPER And a coupon please. -Are sanitary towels rationed too? Unbelievable. What do you do with all those coupons? -I take them to the food office. And then I can place a new order. I'm going out for a bit. I think it's safe. -How can you be so sure? I know my own office. -Don't be so scared. Let's look one more time. FOOD OFFICE Hands up. This is a hold-up. Wilhelmus van Nassauwe... -No joking around now. No joking around. Mr Mertens, I'm so proud of you. Yes, I recognized you. The bathroom? Where's the bathroom? ESKENS PIANO TUNING AND REPAIR Come with us. Speak then. Speak up, man. Don't you love your wife? She's in pain. Do you hear? Do you hear what they're doing to her? Who can listen to that? Please, Mr Eskens. You know we're not humane. We'll do anything. Yes, hello? What? A hold-up? Food office? Right away! What's going on? Stop everybody and check if they have coupons. You stand right here, Mr Van Dale. You're short-sighted. You made it through. You weren't arrested for anything serious. A small thing. I forgot a tool yesterday. Come with me. The piano needs to be tuned. It was tuned yesterday. Doesn't matter. Tune it again. Are you sure? That can't be good. I was a nurse. I'm a National Socialist and I took a decision. Yes, hello? -Yes, hello. Poerstamper speaking. -Hello, Poerstamper. Yes, the hold-up of the food office. What, Mertens? The Director himself? Yes, understood. Thank you, Mr Poerstamper. Hello! Wait a moment. Thanks. Anything else wrong. -It's all fine. I feel responsible, so if anything happens, let me know. I'm in charge here, Mr Schults. You have visitors again. In your room. Without glasses, I can't even see if it's a man or a woman. I think she looks like the woman who betrayed me. She joined me straight after you left. Very patriotic. An hour later, I was arrested. It's beautiful. Really beautiful. You should have become an artist, after all. So everything's still safe. -Absolutely. They don't know about our organisation. I'm certain of that. Mail for London. We know you like her, but she was seen with a German officer. Who was seen with a German officer? -Miep Algera. Our English teacher. I bet she's a secret member of those hand raisers. The bitch. -Maybe she fell in love with the fellow. Luftwaffe isn't SS. She might not be linked to the NSB. Shave her hair off and quarter her. Just wait. What did he look like? -To me they're all Krauts. I'll strangle her myself when the time comes. We can't all be heroes. Intellectuals like us don't have many weapons. But I think we achieve more than those so-called resistance people... ...who go around cutting telephone cables and shooting NSB members. We, the Dutch, have always been repulsed by such behaviour. The occupation shouldn't change our mind. We shouldn't copy the bad things of our opponent. We should fight, but with the weapons of the mind. Keep the altar fire burning. The weapons of the mind. We won't speak to Miep Algera anymore. Right, get out your English grammar books, page 26. We start with our German grammar, at page 33. Piet Poerstamper, wipe this out, please. Guys, it's true that my father is from German descent. And my brother, with whom I don't speak anymore... ...fights with the Waffen SS on the Eastern Front. But I pronounce my name Dutch style, Schults. I would have preferred to change it to Schout of Schouten. Also, I'm sorry that I have to teach this wretched language. Did he say that? German's a wretched language? You should call the German police. -Maybe I will. Or maybe not. A National Socialist has certain obligations. But we also shouldn't antagonise people unnecessarily. When the Netherlands will have been annexed by Germany... ...we'll build the Great-Germanic Empire with them. What's the name of that teacher? -Schults. Or Schulz. A traitor, even worse. I can't get the coupons, Miss. I tried my best for you, but you don't meet the requirements. Rejected. By the highest authority. I thought as much. -Thought as much? How can I feed five people? Come on, mother. -I tried my best. They say others come first. -Of course. That means I can't give you bacon anymore. It's only fair. -You eat us out of house and home. Have an extra serving today then. Two kilos of cherries, please. -Do you have coupons? No. -We'll do it black. What's wrong? -The Krauts are here. Raise the alarm then. -Alarm? My name is Hare! My name is Hare! Good afternoon, selling cherries? -No. We're not selling. Everything goes to the city. It's not allowed without coupons. -Everything's allowed. I've never seen you in the city before. What's your name? Marie Bovenkamp. So write down my name. -I'll remember it. I guess you're not NSB members. No way. -I know many are against us. But that doesn't prove anything. Everybody was against the first Christians too. Good afternoon. What was that creep saying? -Nothing. Did he want something? -No, nothing. So he wasn't checking on us? -No. Why was he wearing that black uniform? -Go ask him that. He wanted cherries. He said he wouldn't tell. I longed for your visit. Give me one day in Amsterdam. I'm completely isolated. I don't even have guard duty... ...because every Kraut would notice my non-Arian profile, even at night. I know I'm a pain, but I don't care. Apart from insect powder, I need tobacco the most. How's the news? -Perfect. I don't trust them. I don't trust anybody anymore. My children, my wife, my brothers and my sisters have all become ghosts. I assume my dad was gassed. Jews don't believe it's happening, but I do. I'm suspicious. Old Cohen Kaz was gassed. End of story. I'm only interested in keeping the young Cohen Kaz out of their hands. You'll have to wait here until the English arrive. Will they come? Flying fortresses. Half of Berlin has been destroyed. Tonight, the other half goes. You'd think it was the end of the world. A German woman stepped out of the train and hugged her husband, an officer. And the woman yelled: "Oh God, Germany's burning". And the man said "Hush" and walked away with her. Germany's burning. All of Germany's burning! We're doing bloody well, here. Traitors! Let's go for a bike ride together. -As long as I'll catch the last ferry. Traitor! Hurray, hurray! Of course you'll catch the last ferry. You must have heard what they said: "Traitor". I'd be crazy not to ignore that. But do you feel that way too? That you're a traitor? No way. It's a ridiculous thing to say. I'd do anything for my country. The country's not just this land, but everything, Lebensraum. The land, that's the farmers. And we fight for the farmers. Don't you want farmers to get a better life too? Of course. -See? And that's what we fight for. I can see you join us one day. Join you? Never. Is your family against it? -They all are. It's no fun anymore. My dad says farming has never been this bad. It's the Germans' fault. And you collaborate with the Germans. Collaborate? Depends how you look at it. Some of us are anti-German. And it speaks for itself. We'd also prefer to solve problems ourselves. Without the... Krauts, everything would be better. So you're also against the Krauts. -Yes, in a way I am. Although Germany has to win the war. So they can take charge in Europe. But that doesn't mean I'm for the Germans. So you're against them. And when people in hiding are arrested? Are you against that? I'd never go into hiding if I had to go to Germany to work. But I understand it happens. I don't think it's very bad. But you're against the Jews. -Yes, I'm against them. Me too. A Germanic girl like you has to be against them. Jews look for girls like you. That's a known fact. Just read Hitler's Mein Kampf. Have you never had a Jew after you? -No way, I don't want them. Who do you want? And Hitler is an asshole who hunts small countries. Say something. What should I say? Did you know NSB members in Amsterdam? Not today. It's not possible. Not today and not tomorrow. My back hurts from working the hay. Holland fell due to betrayal... And Hitler is an asshole who hunts.. You're going to miss the last ferry. -I don't care. I'll sleep in a haystack. NSB men don't mind that. SS men always sleep under the open sky. They can go for three days without food. That's why they're invincible. I'm pregnant. Why aren't you saying anything? -Yes, well... Are you sure? -Sure? Did you feel it? -What could I feel? Silly. Let's wait and see. It might still come. When should it have come? Fourteen days ago or more. In that case, you'll have to marry, of course. I'll tell father myself. After church, so he can't start about it during the service. You could have been more careful. I didn't like it from the start. What will you live on? He doesn't have a dime. Who are you talking about? -Who? About him, no? No way. No way? -Aren't you with him? Aren't you with him? -Not anymore. I don't want him. I'm with someone else now. Kees Poerstamper from the pharmacist. He makes enough. Kees Poerstamper, the NSB member? Your father's going to love this. Marie's pregnant. It's true. From Kees Poerstamper. God damn it. Marie and I broke up. She has someone else now. An NSB member. An NSB member? Did Bovenkamp tell you that? Marie told me herself. -Who is it? Kees Poerstamper, from the pharmacist. -Kees Poerstamper? Damn it! Shut up. Where does Poerstamper live? -I understand you want to go after him. But how do you want to do that? You don't seem to be thinking of us. You don't have to come along. Mertens means that while you're in hiding here... ...you can't go to town to punish this Mr Poerstamper. Why not? -Incredible idiot. Why did you even start with that slut? That white-faced farm slut. Without asking me for psychological advice. You weren't here yet. You're right. I was still in Amsterdam. I'd prefer to go back to Amsterdam. -Me too, but it's impossible. You might be able to go back, but I can't. If you want to beat up NSB members, join an assault group. You'd be doing something useful. While we're here and you're here, no jokes with that Poerstamper. It's Sunday evening, 11 o'clock. The Krauts are returning from the women. What does that mean, Van Waveren? -That guard duty starts again. You can't do that three weeks in a row with a girl. And if you insist, we have a pharmacy full of things here. Now you have to get married. Do you have a picture of her? Not even. I'd hardly recognize her in the street. Did you ever notice any other guys? You have to disappear for a while. She could have a miscarriage. She might not be pregnant at all. An English bomb could fall on her farm. But first you have to disappear. You should go... into hiding. Come. Terrible, my son to the Eastern Front. First to a training camp, but then to the Eastern Front. But it's even worse for you. Does he have a nice picture of you? A healthy girl, of Germanic blood... ...will always choose a boy like her. Blond, open, strong. You and Kees will be alright. I bet all your boys were like that. Come on, Kees won't have been the first. You can tell me. I won't tell Kees. What is there to tell? You must have had other boys. Not the last couple of years. They've all gone to Germany. That one's had it, boys. Yes, sir. -But they say they live until a hundred. Maybe he was 98 when you got him. You know what? Sell me the crow, alright? For how much, sir? -For a cent. Not so modest. You get 25 cents each. If you tell nobody he's dead. Deal? Here, Marie. This was delivered for you. For me? -By whom? From the mail. -The mail? How's that possible. Mail never arrives at this hour. He had to be in the area. -Miss Marie Bovenkamp. Sender: Kees Poerstamper, SS. Open it after dinner. -Open it, Marie. That girl cares less and less. She just sits there. Let someone else open it then. Yuck, what's that? That looks like our crow. Is that your crow? Why is he dead? It must have died on its own. Crows tend to do that. You'd think we were in the pub here. If you start to tear the place down, you can go. I'm getting fed up with these people in hiding. Me too. -What was that silly joke with the crow? At least someone stood up for you. You should have stayed with him. -Stood up for me? Didn't you notice? -He thought Griekspoor did it. Did what? -The crow, of course. Where's your brain? Didn't you notice how you were insulted? The crow was Kees Poerstamper in his uniform. I didn't understand it right away. -That dead crow? Yes, don't you understand? They mean to say that your Kees had best die on the Eastern Front. But it's impossible. -Staying here is impossible. Jan needs a couple of days holiday. Me too. It's still impossible. -It'll be Saturday tomorrow. They don't check as well. On Sunday, all the Krauts go to the girls. It's impossible. When you're in hiding, you can't make daytrips. If you promise to be back on the last ferry, on Sunday. My father has people in hiding. -In hiding? I thought you'd like to know. Why do you tell me that? -I thought you'd want to know. You didn't have an argument with your dad, did you? Griekspoor, just a boy. Didn't want to work in Germany. Same for Van Waveren. He's not unfriendly. Mertens, he's a... -Mertens? Not Piet Mertens, from the hold-ups of the food office? Yes. Mertens... Who else? Cohen. -Cohen? A Jew? It keeps getting worse. Tell me, what's going on between you and Cohen? Nothing. Cohen's strange. I don't want to have anything to do with him. Does he have a big nose? Does he drool? Seeping eyes, desert feet... Marie spends the night here. I'll put in a good word for the two boys. The poor sods have been misguided by English radio. But Mertens and Cohen are real... -My parents can't help it either. Alright. And the farm? Will they leave it be? Your father, your mother and the farm will be fine. Promise it. -Yes, yes. I promise. Read Hitler's Mein Kampf. He explains it perfectly. That girl fooled around with Cohen, I'm telling you. If he looks so very Jewish, as you say... ...the child has to have Jewish features, or else Kees is in trouble. Kees walks free. German doctors can tell Jewish blood to the exact percentage. I've been a nurse. Do you have to get up again? -Yes. Are you asleep? I won't turn them in. Those people in hiding. I won't turn them in. It's way too dangerous. The Germans won't betray me, but that girl with her unreliable face... She won't be able to keep her mouth shut. And if the resistance finds out I turned Mertens in... If the English come... Where were you hiding? Dear, dear gentlemen. Speak of prisons and concentration camps... ...but going into hiding is the way to learn about... ...Count August von Platen-Hallerm?nde. But we're coming out of hiding for a couple of days. Jan, have you been laying in a dung heap? You stink. Where did you sleep? I'm glad to escape the smells, the farts, the stinking feet. I'll take you to a friend who has a bathroom. Do you know the way here? I want to avoid Mr Schults' house. There are no checks for identity papers at stations. No overfull trains. Even the ticket collectors are polite. Amsterdam, I missed you. The hot asphalt under your feet. The zoo, the public library. But first a drink. -Jenever. Nectar of the gods, of the Dutch merchants. So much for rumours that you can only buy it with coupons. Another one? -Waiter, service. A real Amsterdam urinal. Did I miss those. This makes my day. Beautiful, just like a shell. A real urinal. Do you have to go too? Wait. Me first. And we're taking as long as we can. I'm safe as long as the Krauts don't take off my pants. I'm here for the Arbeitseinsatz. -Report for the Arbeitseinsatz? I had an argument with my girlfriend and I'm fed up. I'd rather work in Germany. This is the SD. Nothing to do with the Arbeitseinsatz. You've been in hiding. -No, sir. But I can't stand it anymore. I'd rather work in Germany. Where were you in hiding? And if you feed the dog some sausage, he won't bark. On Sunday evenings, between 7 and 11, there's no guard. That's when the Germans go to the who... ...to the women. If you go this Sunday, don't go too early... ...or else Cohen won't be back. It must be a strong, smelly sausage. Then you'll be safe. I have to be back in time tomorrow. I have to catch the last ferry. Where are you staying? -In a nice country house. At an excellent location between the big rivers. Did you ever hear from your wife? Let's not talk about that. You've gotten skinny. Next time, I'll bring some bacon from the farm. Let's see if you've gotten skinny as well. Krauts. There are Jews here! -To the hiding place. Excuse me. Do you know where I can go into hiding around here? That's not very easy. Is it for Jews? No, just boys who don't want to work in Germany. It won't be for long. I'll have something else in three weeks. It's beautiful here. Are you an artist? High school teacher. My name's Schults. Mies. Mies Evertse. A farm would do. It's only temporary. I think you're careless. Who says I'm not with the NSB? NSB members are not cheerful, right now. They're very worried. And with reason. I'll ask around for an address. What if we meet again next... -Tomorrow evening. I swear it's the same woman who turned you in. A beautiful woman. -Yes, she was. See? And very patriotic. It's worth a try. A colleague. German teacher. Half-German himself. Again, you don't notice me. Because I was wondering if that captain could be a W?rttemberger. Where? How do you see that? -I'm from German descent myself. I used to be able to see whether someone was a Saxon or from the Harz. These days you see so many Germans, too many almost. I haven't been able to find anything yet, Miss Evertse. People are hesitant to hide someone in their house. There's no more need. I found something. Tea, please. So I should call you Herr Schulz? -Yes and no. I'll show you something interesting. That's my brother August. -So he's with the SS? You bet. He's fighting in Russia. Has been wounded twice. He's a real fighting officer. A tactician. Don't you mind having a National Socialist in the family? He doesn't care that much about National Socialism. For him, the main thing is to be active. I imagine Hitler to have a similar character. I don't think he understands much of the National Socialist doctrine. To act, to lead, that's what Hitler cares about. So you think Hitler doesn't understand National Socialism? I had better go. But we will meet again, won't we? I really don't know. I can't see much through my sunglasses. You should have worn your normal glasses then. She would have recognized me. And now you didn't recognize her. Why didn't you make her get up? Walk around a bit? I might have recognized her by her height. Make her walk around... are you crazy? She's not a model. You were talking to each other like best friends. Go to hell. His name's Schults, the name you can't pronounce. Schults... Schulz. That's his German name. He's ashamed of it. That wouldn't be so bad if he was dedicated to the good cause. But he always cops out. Those people exist everywhere. They can go far. How thick will that concrete vault be? Twenty meters. That's a first, at least in Holland. The airstrip will be a kilometre longer. For a new secret plane, the Messerschmitt 262. My name is Hare! -There he is. How was it? I had a few unforgettable days. I know all the safety rules now. First of all, never be afraid. God, did I enjoy myself. Did you bring us anything? -Bring you anything? I spent all my money and I have a 200 buck debt. But when we go the four of us, it'll be on me. I paid for Jan too, until he left me in a urinal. He's probably already on the way to work for the Krauts. He doesn't care as long as he has a woman. Plenty of those there. Just like at the party where I was last night. Two fantastic women. And I had both of them in the hiding place. We mocked Hitler and drank all night. A friend of mine, also a Jew... Wait with your story. I have to take a leak. The dog doesn't bark. How are the bugs? -They bite a lot. If you scratch that much, you attract them. What's keeping Mertens? Number two, I guess. -He did that at eight. What's that? "My name is Hare", can't you hear? Into the hiding place, quickly. They know we're here. Do you think they got Mertens? We must have been betrayed. We can't do anything for Mertens. We're safe here. We're safe here, guys. We're in Abraham's lap. My name is Hare. They can... Don't do that. Open that trapdoor. Stop or I'll shoot. Mr Poerstamper promised nothing would happen to us. We're interested in this case, because we're personally involved. One of the people is Piet Mertens, from your organisation. He was wanted by the Germans... Can I ask a question? Do you realise you're personally at risk now that he's been taken prisoner? What do you mean? Mertens can be forced to betray you. Piet would never do that. They can turn him inside out. -Good. They also arrested a Jew, Cohen Kaz, one of my best friends. I found that hiding place for him, so I'm responsible. I want revenge for his death. We know who betrayed them. Even if you let this go, I'll personally... Who do you think we are? -You don't know us very well. I've waited for the day to get one of these assholes. We also want revenge for a friend. Can I say something, sir? -No need to be so formal. You speak of revenge. We call it punishment. We come to a verdict and execute it. As punishment and to deter others. But that has nothing to do with revenge. My son did a lot of good work, that way. Yes, your son was a good resistance fighter. Then I'll show you the evidence about who the traitor was. Marie, the farmer's daughter, was engaged to Kees Poerstamper. Farm hand Geert told me a whole story about it. The people hiding at the farm mocked the girl about this. It's likely that she got angry and wanted revenge. Now we've come to an important point. When the Germans set fire to the farm, Marie yelled out... "Mr Poerstamper promised you wouldn't do this." Geert is certain of this and the farm maid confirms it. So the real traitor is that girl. The real traitor is Poerstamper, the pharmacist. Our only proof is the yelling of a stressed out girl. Let's not act like lawyers. These are not the times for it. Poerstamper's dead. End of story. After the food office hold-up, he almost turned Piet in. He's dangerous. There's no room for people like him in our society. He needs a knife or a bullet. I thought I heard something. By the way, the stairs are full of stuff they'll break their necks over. We shouldn't talk too much about this case and just look at the facts. Tomorrow we'll hear another story and we'll suspect a third person. Besides, Poerstamper's an NSB member and can therefore be killed. So what if he later turns out to be innocent in this one case. So we agree that Poerstamper's guilty. Next question: how do we get rid of him? No, no, you're going too fast. I can see you've never dealt with a case like this before. And you have? -Well, no. But my son, who was executed in '41 by the Krauts... Yes, your son knew exactly. We need a council of three and a prosecutor. You can be the prosecutor. You already kind of were. You're the chairman of the council. I declare Henri Poerstamper guilty. And we sentence him to death. Who knows how best to do this? Which weapon, for instance? You must have some experience. Normally, the assault groups perform such executions. We're only with the LO. We don't really have an assault group here. The LO mainly helps people in hiding. We've never needed an assault group. So we might get others to solve the problem. Are you crazy? No way. Finally, I get a chance to take out one of those bloody traitors... Now, now, now. Relax a little. I was explaining the general situation. We know as little about executions as this gentleman himself. We know as little about this as he. We could ask someone from the assault group to take charge. I don't know if I can recommend that. They're good patriots, but also rough customers. They don't care about their own lives. And I'd like to survive Poerstamper by a couple of years. We'd like to be around to see the English arrive, don't we? So I doubt we need the assault group to tell us how to deal with Poerstamper. They commit murders like you blow your nose. Alright we'll do it ourselves. Have you thought about the possible consequences of Poerstamper's execution? I mean the killing of hostages. If they kill 4 people over Poerstamper, that would be a shame. I'm only asking. Listen, gentlemen. I think you're taking the wrong approach. I don't want innocent people to suffer over this case. But we're all in the same boat. The resistance has always followed the principle... ...not to think about consequences for citizens or hostages. That would be exactly what the Krauts want. True? That's true. I could tell you a story about that. I had these curtains custom made. No light comes through. Right, now we can see what we're saying. There once was a hostage whose son was caught as a railway saboteur. The Germans asked him if he realised his father was a hostage. He answered: "Yes, but my country comes first." It may not be true. But that's the attitude of the people who do this work. Next question: where and when? On Saturday morning. That's when he always distributes Nazi pamphlets. Always around 6 AM, so people don't see him. It's dead certain. He never wants someone else to do it, Piet or Kees. Piet once said he could do it the next morning. So his father could sleep in. But when he said that... Poerstamper said: "No, it's my duty." And a National Socialist has to do his duty. A niece of my wife was a maid there for a couple of months. Although she's not a member of the NSB. That's how I know. -Saturday morning. Next question. How? I can see you have no experience with these things. I don't blame you, but... ...how about psychological support? Psychological support? Not for Poerstamper? -Yes, sir. That's part of the procedure. -Yes, it is. Read from the bible and then a prayer. That's part of the procedure. First shoot in the belly or the back. Then walk towards him and then shoot in the temple. Eskens shoots first. -Does he know how? No. -My God. But he wants it so much. If he misses, I'll finish it. Why do all these men have to come. Three is more than enough. It looks like a joke. They insisted. Think it's Gestapo? What do we do? They keep following us. The concrete vaults are 20 metres thick. The airstrip will be a kilometre longer. For a very secret new type of plane, the Messerschmitt 262. Can't you stay a bit? -That's very dangerous. Who could see us this early? I love you. Attention! Fire! Morning, sir. That's all about 'sollen' and 'werden'. Questions anyone? Yes. -I have to talk to you, Schults. They just took Miss Algera away. When she walked past me, she said: "Say hello to everyone for me." It must have been a mistake. She'll be back this afternoon. I wish they'd keep her. Maybe she had a fight with that man of hers. Colleague, think before you speak. The SD has better things to do. -But why then? She was with that officer. She was for the Krauts. Do you think so? -Do you know more? Tell us. I only know what you could already have known as well. Why do the Sicherheitspolizei take people away? The first thing you can think of. It's unthinkable. A woman doing illegal work? Illegal work? You've got to be kidding. You mean writing for illegal magazines? But she didn't do that. Then why was she with that German officer? Because he was the illegal work. The coin finally drops. -I can't believe it. Then why did she accept how we treated her? Yes, why didn't she confide in you? That would have been fun. It's a painful story. We owe a lot to Miep Algera. Do you know that Miss Algera has been taken prisoner? I'd like to say something about this. We haven't been treating Miss Algera with the respect she deserved. You know she was often seen with a German officer. People blamed her for that. And we made her feel that without giving her a chance to defend herself. Not that she would have. She was probably seeing that German... ...to get military information from him. Miss Algera was a spy and worked for the English. She's been arrested and... ...nobody envies her fate. I think we all owe her our respect. Even those with other interests in this war. What we despise in times of peace... ...can be an act of courage in times of war. Miss Algera possessed this courage. What she did... ...she did for her country. In the meaning that most of us give to this word. Let's not forget this. I arranged the uniforms. Do exactly as I say. You shut up, whatever happens. We're Germans. We're looking for the bunker... ...and only Schults speaks German well enough to pass for a German. Every child knows where that bunker is. Why do we have to ask? We're Germans. All good patriots have given us wrong directions. We saw his shop with Nazi propaganda, so we're asking him. How can we know he's an NSB member if there's no NSB propaganda? Please. Can someone give us directions? Yes, where are you going? Come along. Just go. There must be a bunker here that's been painted like a villa. That's not a real bunker, but just... We know. Help, help! Don't shoot. You could hit one of us. Put that gun away. Don't shoot, don't shoot. -Shut up! I didn't do it. -Schults... ...beat him unconscious if he yells. Van Dale, I've got him. Hammer. I swear it's a mistake. Oh come on. You're Henri Poerstamper, right? Yes, sir. -You've been sentenced to death. You'll be killed by bullet. Anything to say? Don't make it too long. You keep an eye on the road. -But I'm innocent. I only seem to be guilty. -Innocent of what? That story with the farm. -You know that so well. We think you're guilty. You have one minute to prepare. I'm innocent. I was going to turn them in, but... ...I didn't do it. I swear to God! If you want to spend your minute on nonsense, that's up to you. One minute is very little. We have no bible here, but... Don't start that again. But I'm innocent. Someone else did it. The German police know who. I'd tell you if I knew. Go to the... ...to the German police. Give me a break. Henri Poerstamper, prepare for death. Our Father... Think of my children. Shut up. What did you do to my son? -Let's go! Help, help! I heard that the pharmacist was killed as a traitor. Really? -But he's still alive. They took him to hospital. The perpetrators got away. They took four hostages. I thought you might want to know. Thank you, Miss. Fire! Somebody to see you, sir. Shall I bring tea? Weren't we going to meet again? But I heard nothing, so I thought... Good gracious, what a monster. It must be your German background. Do you know many Germans? No, but I've heard women remind Germans of monsters. So the woman I saw in a car with a German last Saturday... ...wasn't you. -Of course not. Why do you think that? How can you think that of me? I think that's your German perversion. You want to turn me into a monster... ...before associating with me. To me, the ugly duchess represents that I'm unable to touch a woman... ...while the Netherlands is occupied. This is becoming very serious. You should get help for that, Mr Schults. It's a case of psychological impotence. Psychological impotence, purely due to circumstance. It started in May 1940... ...and it will end in another year. Maybe I have similar obsessions. You don't know much about me. And I can't talk about myself. But I can talk more confidentially to you... ...than to anybody else. And you also don't speak to me like to everybody else. You're not saying that we've fallen in love? Shall we make a bet? -That depends, Miss Evertse. Don't call me Miss Evertse. -Alright, Mies. I don't know it that's a good... -My name's not Evertse. But I bet I can make you forget about the ugly duchess. If you give me... -...the opportunity. But that doesn't make sense, Miss Mies. If I gave you the opportunity, I'd have forgotten about the duchess already. I'm not made of wood or granite. I see, Herr Schulz. Yes, shoot. Schultz calls himself Schults, Dutch style. German teacher. Speaks with contempt about Hitler. Did you understand him correctly? He thinks Hitler's half crazy. He says Hitler doesn't understand National Socialism. We won't arrest him for that... He said he'll be impotent... ...until Germany loses the war. And you think he's dangerous? I can't promise you'll get your revenge. Goodbye. I can only say my need for revenge has been satisfied. I stood up for Cohen. He's facing a miserable fate, thanks to Poerstamper. But two bullets in your body is a big deal. So as far as I'm concerned, the case is closed. You take it lightly. You forgot that we're standing up for Mertens. We haven't forgotten him yet. You're taking the wrong approach. The man was sentenced to death. We shot at him, but were unable to kill him. But in return, the Krauts killed four hostages. If we leave it at this, the entire resistance looks like idiots. There we are. -You're imagining things. Resistance people also have to set the right example for after the war. That's all theory. -No it's not. We'll be accountable for everything we do. There's a hand outside who... ...is supposed to throw flowerpots through the window if anything's wrong. I thought I heard something. Can I say something? I think you're saying that we have to set an example... ...and do everything to perfection. I'm for that. My son always said... ...once you've joined the resistance... ...you've become a machine. We're in the resistance because we don't want to be machines. We have to be practical. Poerstamper saw us in disguise. But he can tell them there was a short guy involved... ...and his moustache was coming off. Don't give me that dirty look. I'm only saying what he would say. What about you? A movie character with a bow tie. Besides, you were careless enough... ...to call each other by your names. Could happen to anyone, don't get me wrong. But when Poerstamper gets his wits back... ...and the Krauts interrogate him... ...and he remembers those names... How did it go? Schults, Van Dale. How many bullets? I'm innocent. Two bullets. She knew I'm innocent. Miss Sch?lvink, miss Sch?lvink. Are you Johan Schulz? Yes. Schults. You have to come to The Hague. Why? The Hague? Sit down. Do you smoke? No, thanks. What's going on? Don't ask. Do I have to take clothes? You don't have to bring anything. Just your coat. Strange. Probably a Quinten Matsys, after Da Vinci. A Leonardo? National Gallery in London. I'd like to visit it. But that bloody war... Get rid of the cigarette. Take off the hat. Empty your pockets. You can keep that. Give me that. A watch A watch. A pack of cigarettes. Eleven. Not on the carpet. Schults, Johan Schults. -Wim Uden. I'm glad someone joined me. Nice place. A bit small for two. Small? Some have four people in them. God. How's life here? -Not bad. They feed us rations. Sugar, jam, everything. It's better than at home. I'm starving all day, but there's also nothing to do here. I could eat two portions. How do they treat you? Do they beat you up? Next door, they smacked one. He hadn't folded his blankets properly. Neither did I. They don't show you how. There are good and bad guards and... Can we get a second stool? What are you here for? Radio. It's all radio here. Or illegal slaughter or Jews. Are there many Jews here? I have a good friend... No, I meant people who helped Jews. What did they arrest you for? I don't know. How long have you been here? One day. And you? -Six days. Stand to attention when I'm talking to you. What's that? He wanted to keep some food for later. So we thought... Would you do that at home? No, but... If it happens again, you'll have to deal with me. Behave. Or we kick you out. What did he say? If it happens again, we can go. You could have warned me. Let's quickly clean the plates. Why did he ask how long we've been here? The doctor's responsible. He's an asshole. Did he hurt you? No, he never hits hard. He's right. It's a mess here. He even brought us that stool in person. Must be a nice guy. Would you want to be kicked out? No. What's your name? -Schults. And you? -Uden. Come along. A letter. You can write a letter. That was a nice little trip. A drive through The Hague, by car. To the Binnenhof. Have you been there? They interrogated me. In a room. Very friendly. But I'm innocent. So I keep denying. So they got angry. They beat me up. For nothing. In that room. Dear mother, this could be a goodbye letter. Thank you for looking after me so well. I also want to thank dad and greet my brother August. I will never see you again. Even if I wanted to reconcile with you. Death is sometimes more important than life. Johan. Is Johan Schulz working here? Yes, that's him. Come along. Come in. Is that him? Then that problem's solved. Mr Schulz, here's your brother. So you knew I was in Scheveningen. Mother showed me your letter. I'm on leave because I've been promoted to Obersturmbahnf?hrer. I have to leave in a couple of days. Without me, you could have been in big trouble. For a moment, I thought you'd joined the resistance. Did you? That letter to mother was rather alarming. I'd gotten a bit stressed in the cell. It says you said at school... ...that you're sorry you have to teach wretched German. What's the point? Little dreamer. Do you still make beautiful drawings? It would be nice if you matured a bit with women. The one next door's a pathetic case. She's got a screw loose. Not the type to tell you'll be impotent while the Netherlands is occupied. Be a bit more careful in the future. As you've noticed, they know everything about you here. Come. Were they decent in jail? -Very decent. They don't send the best people to Holland, but Scheveningen's alright. Yes. How's mother? Pretty good. Your letter scared her a lot. I should congratulate you on your knighthood. Your promotion. I don't care about the knighthood. I fight because I enjoy it. Preferably for a lost cause. If you're against us, that's up to you. But don't join that charade of the resistance. I've seen enough partisans in Russia. And they did something, at least. Don't worry. I learnt my lesson. Holland had to be woken up. Just like you. They're such weaklings. When we were winning, nobody joined the resistance. And now that we're losing, they're all part of it. So you don't think the Germans will win? -No. Could you do something for a friend of mine? A Jew. German teacher, just like me. Caught while in hiding. That's all he did. I helped you because you're my brother. Drive. It would be another 2 years before the Netherlands was liberated.
