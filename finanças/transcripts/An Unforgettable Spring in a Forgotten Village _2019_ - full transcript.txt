C'mon, get up! Good morning, chubby. -Machiato, as usual? Yes, and your aunt, instead of the Turkish delight. You fucking moron! Go away, you rascals! He's here. -Ah, thank God! Welcome, Mr. Mayor! Thank you! Happy school anniversary! Thank you! To you too! Please, help yourself! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE MAYOR HAS JUST ARRIVED. PLEASE BE QUIET. One from yours… and one from yours, so none of you holds a grudge against me, huh?! And now, ladies and gentlemen, we invite the Mayor of our municipality to honor us with a speech. A round of applause for our Mayor! Honored ladies and gentlemen, honored Imam, honored School Principal. Your school has the honor to bear the name of the great Reneisance leader, Naim Frasheri who has ordered us through his poems to "Work, work night and day, so we can see the light of day". Me and my party, we have emphasized in our political platform that our priority is investment on the education of young generations, and we promise that each day it will get better and better. As you know, we are working on the realism of a sewage project for all schools and I promise that next year your pupils will start the new school year with computers. Aplause Good news… for our boy. Allow me to congratulate your School Anniversary, and to wish you a lot of success for this school end-year and for upcoming school years. Thank you! We thank our respected Mayor for this meaningful speech and we promise him that this school year will be a great success. Not wanting to waste your time, allow me to invite all of you to our humble cocktail... so we can all have a drink together to mark this solemn day. Thank you! I must go. They'll kill me if they notice I'm gone. When can I see you again? I don't know. As long as our fathers are foes, we must be careful… Once they reconcile… They'll never reconcile… We must hope so! Love you! Love you too! I'm off now. Shpresa! The kids have seen us. Get away from here! Go… go… Where have you been? In the loo! Why?! Use your head a little. Don't humiliate your father. Mr. Principal, I hear the Mayor said something about employment... Yes, and… sorry, where was I… My son is close to graduation… So I'd like to somehow solve the issue with his employment… We'll fix this issue, Sabit. Come by my office someday, and we'll talk. Now excuse me because I have some business with the Mayor. Yes, yes, I understand… Avdil, come here! I am coming. A toast for the health of the Mayor! Cheers! This stuff just made this trip worthwhile! Since we've gathered here, I'd like to ask you something, as a friend? Is there a chance that you can invest some money... For our school renovation… We're in a disastrous condition. Yes, yes... We're working on it... Don't worry. But do tell me something… And don't lie… No Are you getting any pussy? Cheers! Douchebags! -Douchebag! What are you doing?! Checking what's on other channels. Don't you see I'm watching the Germans?! I worked 45 years in Germany, and in the end, I returned to die in this shithole... Is your mother asleep? -Yes. She got old very quickly. I'm old, my wife's old, I have an old bachelor at home… everything got old! I piss on life! The worst thing is that I can't do anything like I did before... If you're going to watch that damn channel of yours, turn the volume off... bacause you're embarrassing us in front of the neighbors. We can hear it all. You're ruining my life, you are… Get up princesses, you've reached the king's castle. Mursel! Come on Madonna. Come on sweetheart. Sweetheart. Good luck! Come on Tatyana. Good luck! Mursel! It looks good. Hey Maliq, you bighead bastard! -You rascal… Xhinga has brought three chicks. -Cheers. Tonight, they're opening the bar. Tonight, they're opening the bar. Tonight, they're opening the bar. Silence in the mosque! Chubby, three teas over here. -Right now! Three teas over here too! -Yes, yes, right now! What are we doing tonight? It's done! Just don't forget, huh? Cheers As I've said, we're not taking Avdil along tonight! Ok, ok. Please tell me has anyone seen them? No one so far. Mursel said they're sleeping. Yes, right, sleeping… sleeping with Xhinga probably! Xhinga will 'inaugurate' them, and then the whole village. I'd give all my wealth only to be in his shoes… oh my, in bed with three airplanes… mmm… You fucking moron, you haji, you don't have any wealth… with your wealth you can only get to sniff their 'tank', that's all. You know what? Suck my balls! This will be your common room; it has a TV set, a kitchen where you can cook. These is your room, princess… And this is... your room... queen… watch your head. These are 'working' rooms. If the business goes well, we'll fill the bar with your 'colleagues'. Very nice! I like it very much! -See you later! -What? Xhinga, what do you mean later… don't forget our agreement: you get 70% of the profit and I get 30%. -Yes. The tips are mine. What do you mean yours?! I get all the tips from singing. No, no. We will split the tips fifty-fifty. What do you mean fifty-fifty! 100 % belong to me… the tips are from my singing. Ok Madonna, ok. You don't need to repeat it all the time. Sorry honey, but I want a clear deal. -Me too! Daddy, goal. -No, honey, not yet. -Daddy, goal. -Not yet... be quiet! Goooooal! -Where did you see that goal, you monkey! Go away! Damn you, why did you hit him?! Come to mommy… -Well done! Test, test… One, two, one, two… It's late and no one's here! Maybe the Imam spoke to them, and scared them off. You're right. That motherfucker! He is doing this to me deliberately just because I still owe him the money for father's funeral. I told you not to ruin the relationship with the Imam because then the whole village will be against you. But you won't listen to me. And now… Cut the crap! Cheers to table number four! Quiet! You see? Xhinga’s business never fails. Get ready to empty their wallets! C'mon, get ready! Quickly, quickly, quickly! In a month you can start thinking which car you'd like to get from me... And a wife? It's best if you wait one more year. OK? -OK. Ah, haji! Congrats! Welcome! How is your health? Congratulations for this… Thank you! This is for you, for you… Hey, Kico… -What's up… I did it, didn't I tell you so… Welcome… Come in, come in… Good evening! Welcome! I am happy to see you! Good evening! Welcome! I hope we will have a great time. Very handsome people! I sincerely hope we are going to enjoy together every night! I love you! I love you all! Welcome! I hope we will have fun together! I am Madonna, and this are Rozi and Tatyana! Tatyana and Rozi! Do you have a lot more to do? -A little bit more… So, I'll go lie down. May Allah unite us in Paradise, inshallah! I made the Ukrainian one pass out! She won't forget Kica, no… because Kica is badass! Xhinga, you're the boss! Mursel, one raki for me and ask Xaja what he's drinking. No, no! You ask Kica what he's drinking, because it looks like tonight was his first time. The chick is talking to the cock. Who stop the music? Play some music! Avdil, this knife is longing for some human stomach. -Stay calm! I never start things, you know that… but if someone messes with me… Enough with this crap! For God's sake tell me how was that sweetheart? Honey. Like honey, mmm. I miss you! -I don't! You're mean! When will we see each other? I don't know. I'm not allowed to go out. You know why. I can come now to your yard. No! You fool! I'll stand down your balcony like Romeo, and recite poems for you… I'll call you later, don't fall asleep… Tomorrow morning, I have an appointment with the school principal... I heard the school needs a computer teacher. You must graduate soon. The diploma is worthless if you don't have connections in the party. Let me worry about party connections. You worry about finishing the exams, don't waste your time on the phone with the daughter of that bastard. Not enough money. -I don't have more. -Ok, go! Mursel! Good night! Good night! Good night boy! Motherfucker… Congregation... The Devil has come to our village, may Allah help us. Haram will be in it's peak now since that sinner has opened that devil's bar and has brought those three whores - as meze for raki, may Allah have mercy on us! And where has opened this bar? Near the graves, near the skeleton of our family members, with intention to provoke us: the living and the dead. How can we tolerate this shame, congregation? Is it appropriate for a slave of Allah to wake up in the evening and go home in the morning? To spend the whole night with music and other nonsense, dancing with the devil on his back, drowning in sin with raki and whores... to forget about namaz to leave his children at home alone as orphans, to leave the fields deserted… Aren't all these sings of Judgment Day? What other sings you want to see in order to be convinced?! Those whores that were brought by that sinner, may Allah break his neck yarabi… They are sent by the Devil. Those who sit close to them, those are closer to the Devil, closer to the destruction, closer to the doors of hell. I swear to God, they say they brought three whores at the bar! They haven't, Inshallah! I swear to God, if I find out that my man is spending our money on whores, I'll kill him! Don't worry; They'll have fun one week and then they'll grow bored. Oh yeah? Easy for you to say since you don't have a husband. I won't ever have one! Women, men are like dogs. The moment they see a bitch, they all go running to mount her. Shame on them! -May God punish them! Taste some honey. It's very good this year. This is delicious. -Yes, very delicious. Lule, protect the honey bee houses, because Selki might steal your honey for the bar. All your work will become food for the whores. There's nothing worse than that, huh? He knows he can't touch this garden because I'll cut his hand, I swear! And what if he touches your other garden, the dark one? He knows what I'll do to him. Only a bomb would solve this, only a bomb, to blow up the devil's bar! Where are you going? -I'm going to Selki's, he has an emergency! You're going to the whores! Come back home, every night like this… come back home, I'm telling you… Lemi! Don't expect to find me home when you return in the morning! C'mon, shut up already, or the neighbors will hear you. I’ll be back early, I promise. Tatyana! -Yes, darling! I have big problem! The time has come to become a man. You know, man, man, strong! Because everyone is telling me that Daut's son is behaving like a girl. Commes fille! Girl, girl! No, Daut. He is strong. Like father, like son. Strong man. But no, Tatyana. No. Take off your pants! Don't just stand there; take off your pants. I want the whole village to know that Daut's son is a man. Do you understand? Take off your pants now! Daut, no darling, he's very shy. You go out, go! Listen to me: if you fail, you better jump out of the window. Don't make me kill you with my own hands! Daut, out! Tatyana... My love, mon amour! Au revoir! Au revoir! His balloon will burst! Did I tell you he can see the future. Whatever he says, happens! Hey, I will punch your nose… -What nose, huh? Run away, someone is coming… It is Shpresa's father! -Yes, really, uncle Sokol! It's my son! -Good for him! -Thank you! Harder! Mursel, faster! Boys! Take your issues outside. I don't want trouble here. Xhinga, how are you? What did you say! -Nothing, we are fine! This whiskey is on the house! Gratis! As a welcome! And for you Mr. Principal, your "gratis" is upstairs! As a gift for failing me in school! Thank you, Xhinga. Have a seat with us. Later. I'm a little busy! You have fun. -Thank you. Even as a pupil he used to be a troublemaker. I've beaten him very often. But I always knew he'll do something with his life! Today it is right to say: who fails school, succeeds in business! Cheers! Please, don't fail my son, give him a pass, give him a pass! Xharra, leave me alone! I said no! I'm not going against my principals! Stop the music! Stop the music! Today my son became a man. Congratulations! -Thank you! Thank you! The Ukrainian told me: like father, like son; both with big balls. Mursel, get everyone a drink on me. This is the happiest night of my life! Now start the music! Are you out of your mind? If my father sees you he'll kill you! No one will see us. All the village men are at the bar. My dad is in his room… sleeping. Yes, sleeping… with a whore, probably. Hey, don't you dear speak like that about my father… I saw him in his car, driving towards the bar. I don't believe it. Forget about it. I came to pick you up to take you somewhere where we can be alone. It's night time, you dummy, can't you see I'm in my pajamas? Please! C'mon, please! Wait here while I put my sneakers on! My wife went raving mad. Last night she threatened me that if I come here once again she'll cut my throat while I'm asleep. She's very tough… She's very tough… Yours shouldn't complain… I stole from my wife all of her gold for paying my debt to Xhinga. But I don't care, you only live once. Oh Avdil, my friend, before I pass away, I want to have fun, I want to have a blast! My dear Selki, pleasure is bigger than Istanbul. Get up and have fun… Thanks for turning her on for me, Xaja. The money turns her on, I make her burn. Hey, they're fighting. -Who is fighting who? -Kica and Xaja. -Get down. I want to see… Get out, you faggot! Leave me alone! I'm going to spill his guts on the floor, fucking faggot… Kica, put the knife away, or else I'll never allow you to come in this place again! Let that pigeon man in, he just wants to show off. He's harmless… Move away, let me show myself off to him, let me crack the stomach of this faggot. Kica, I will cut your throat! Xaja, get back inside! Kica is stronger! -No way, Xaja is stronger! Hey, get Xaja back inside! -I will cut your throat! Mursel, go back inside! Go inside! Kica, you know I love you like my own brother, but you're overdoing it! Now give me the knife. Give it to me! Kica, if you give me the knife... I'll give you the Moldavian one for the whole night. For how much? -Half price. No… I don't have the money. Better give me Xaja, so I can spill his guts! Xaja, you faggot, come out, come out… Fine, fine. I’ll give her to you for free. Now give me the knife. If you're lying to me, believe me that a stomach will get pierced tonight… Don't ask me afterwards what happened. When did I lie to you, Kica, huh? Tell me?! Now give me that knife! Come and drink some water otherwise you won't get it up drunk like this, and you'll fall asleep on top of the Moldavian. Beautiful, huh? -Yes, like in movies. Are you cold? What? Are you cold? A little. I'll give you an A in the subject of physical education, and a C in mathematics. How come a C? I want an A. But the teacher wrote an F with a pencil. I'm upgrading it to a C. Give me that pen, I'll write an A myself. You're not my teacher! OK, here, write it yourself… but they'll recognize your writing, just so you know. Give me an A too… Give me an A too… Avdil, you won't find prettier flowers than these neither in heaven! Xhinga, I swear to God, when Imam talks about heaven, I always think of your yard. I even told him once, in front of the congregation at the mosque. But he said that... The devil knows how to trick us through the beauties of this world, ready to catch us - like the fishes. He doesn't like me, that motherfucker. I hear he's talking crap about me every day; that he wants to ruin my business… Listen, if you bring Imam to my bar one night, I'll give you a big reward. That will be difficult, he's so stubborn… He'll soften up, he'll soften up, just talk to him every day, don't stop. You might be in bed with all three whores. Xhinga... it's my dream to sleep with all three of them at the same time! Shame! I was terrified when I got here. For a second I thought I was at the zoo. Pupils cannot be blamed! When the cat's away the mice will play. Drita, cut it out, please! We don't have time to guess who's to blame, or whos'e responsible etc. If this thing goes up to the institutions, we are done. My suggestion for solving this situation is to… leave the grades as they are, forged… let's complete this school year as it is now, and let this be a lesson for us for the upcoming years. What? I am strongly against this absurd proposal of yours. I agree with Drita. Those who have not come to teach must be held liable. This is shameless. Ferat, you're always boring us with your moralizations. But, as not all of you agree with my proposal here, I suggest we all exercise our democratic right and vote: who is in favor and against my proposal. So, all those in favor of my proposal, raise your hand. May God forgive you all for this crime! So, this means that my proposal is accepted. Now you may go back in class. One more thing: None of you... should go back to that bar again! No one! Have patience, we are only few days away from the termination of the school year. That's all! "THE TEAHOUSE IS CLOSED" You pour bromine in the food, and stirr it. How much should we use? Half a teaspoon is sufficient, you can't put more as you might poison them. I learned this secret recipe from my husband, my his soul be in heaven. When he was doing his military service he used to work in the kitchen, and under his commander's order, he had to prepare this for the soldiers, for paralyzing their thingy. Yes, yes. Is it dangerous? But you have to be very careful, the children shouldn't touch the food. But even with their paralyzed thingy, they will continue going to the bar. If they can't have sex with those whores, then they'll drink all night. Raki costs money. The issue is how to stop them from going to that devil's bar. I have something that can solve that problem too. Ricinus. -And what is that? They won't be able to hold anything in their stomachs. This sounds better than the bromine, which might ruin the things for us also. I'll use the bromine, if it helps. Let the pig explode! When he's coming home at night, turned on by those whores, he's trying to persuade me into sex, thinking I can help him out. But I won't do it! He has to choose, either me or the whores! I hope we manage to stop them. We have to try everything, to cook their meals with this recipe of Zarije, not to wash their clothes so they stink like pigs, to hide their wallets, if neccessary, disfigure them, just to stop them somehow... Yes, yes, otherwise they won't get over it! It's a good party here, Lem. Better than inside the bar. Yes, I see. Folk music with farts. I think raki poisoned us. It's not raki. This is a gift from our wives. They're sprinkled our food with something. Turn off the light! Turn off the light! Thank you. -You are welcome! Did you have the same problem? It never happened to me before. It sucks, motherfucker. The wives are plotting something, but I don't know what. Xhinga, I feel stupid telling you this now, but... I know, I know. I'll give you 10 back, and keep another 10, because it is not our fault. No big deal, tomorrow they'll be back in your pocket. I couldn't do anything with the Ukranian one, she laughed at me but I told her don't laugh because tomorrow I'll make you cry. Cunt! I though Imam will make trouble to us, but it seems it's the women. Our business will fail. You never know, maybe it will blossom even more. The men should decide to never eat again at their homes, and our business is saved. Where should they eat then, in the fields? Tomatoes? At our bar. A grill is not expensive. Come here! You're becoming smart. Dear pupils, this school year completed with great success, despite of some problems in the end... hmmm, but we'll deal with those problems once we meet again in September. Be good children, listen to your parents, play and have fun during the summer, and don't hang around places not suitable for children. Congratulations on your good grades. Goodbye and see you in September. We will solve the problem with the grades in September. I will punish them hard! Haji, so help you Allah, what is going on in that bar... no one is coming for daily prayers. Don't hold it against them Imam, for you still haven't seen those hookers, they look like nymphs of paradise. Like nymphs of paradise! I swear! When you see them with your own eyes, you'll get convinced. It's unlike me to go there, I am an Imam. The Imam should be where his congregation are. Yes, yes, you said it right. Lately, I see you very rarely with a book in your hands. This is not good. The admission test for the university is approaching. You are starting to be kind of dreamy. It is common for young people to be dreamy but not also for people your age... Be careful how you talk to your father. Let him be careful about what he says and what he does. He entered the puberty in old age. Get up, quick! Shpresa, Shpresa! Leave her; she'll get over it, we've spoiled her, now we should deal with her. I can't understand what's going on with her, why is she so full of rage. You don't understand?! Don't play naive, please. Hey, where are you going? Stop! Go away! What are you talking about? You can spend the whole night with your whores! Your job is to go to school, and not... You have no right to tell me what to do with my life. Man, can't you get it in your head? No, it's impossible! Take the sheep away from here! Do you know how much two sheep costs? I'm giving them to you for free! I'll take them away once I'm done inside. No way! Take the sheep home, and once you take a bath and make some money, you can come back. Listen to me, brother, listen to me, I don't want to come to your house, but to your bar, like everyone else. Have mercy, let me go in just once and I'll never come back. I give you my word. It's out of the question, how many times do I have to tell you! Motherfu, sheep are after whores too. Are you the Mayor's driver? -Yes! Go, please, and take care of his car before the sheep scratch it! Don't worry. It's a state car. So what! Come inside. The Mayor is having a blast. Two sheep and one lamb? -No! It's over! I said NO! Three sheep? Shpresa! -What now?! No, no, no. Tatyana will not accept that. I can't! What is the problem? She says she doesn't accept. She's too scared. Oh c'mon, as if it will be her first time. Tell her to go in, finish her job. Don't make me push her inside against her will. Do you understand? -I understand. I have special guests tonight. Calm down, I'll take care of this. Go in the other room. Thank you honey! Careful, your head! You're spoiling them. Let this be the first and the last time they behave like this. Is that clear? -Yes, ok. Go finish it quickly because the clients want music. Ok, honey! Get up. Get up. Let's see where the problem is! My dear, you do have a special problem. Let's find out what are the consequences of this problem. You probably never saw fools like this in your teahouse. He seems to be made especially for taking care of sheep, as he has ram's balls. Bless him! He's good! He's just tickling her, this is nothing. Oh, oh, oh, oh... he's killing her. Oh, oh, oh. Do you know how much! -Yes, I know! -Do you know how difficult! -Yes, I know! -You know my ass! -What? Everything I have done, it was for the people… Are we there yet? Give me a raki. You've finished what you came here for, now get out of here, as we agreed. Yes, yes. After I've had a shot of raki. Fill it up! My raki is on her! Wise men said: "pleasure brings poverty at your doorstep". Xinga... You are doing a fantastic job. What's happening? So help me Allah, I will not wash the corpse of the one who just got killed. What has gotten into you, for Allah's sake? Where are you going? To the mosque! God forbid! They've abandoned God's path! May God punish them. Wake up congregation! Wake up! Wake up and pray to Allah for forgiveness… Wake up you sinners, you scoundrels… Oh you who are tricked by the devil's servant, with alcohol and whores… oh you who are firing guns before the prayers, terrifying our wives and children, be aware that the punishment of Allah might delay, but it will come for sure… Didn't we learn anything at all from the punishment Allah has sent unexpectedly to the sinners in the time of prophet Noah, prophet Lot and prophet Moses… the punishment came to these people unexpectedly, in a night like this one… That's how it will come to us, because the men of this village are in deep shit, may Allah punish you! Do you think you can escape Allah's punishment come to morning prayer, congregation, come and ask Allah for forgiveness… come before it is too late! It's raining it's raining! There is no rain today honey; the sun is burning. It's raining; it's raining... Dear God, watch my son. Let's go. My congregation forsook me. O Allah, give me strength to resist the temptation of sinning, because I have grown very weak. I have enough pain afte my son's death, please spare me from another temptation! Guide me, oh Allah! Give me a sign that You are listening to my prayer! Allah! Allah! Do you know where the old man went? An hour ago, he dressed up in white suit and left. He didn't tell me where he was going. Do you have any money, coins, because I have none... Look up in my blue sweater, in the drawer, left pocket. What did you say, he went out dressed in a white suit?! -Yes. -That old fucker... Mursel, fill this with energy drink and give it to Kica's old man. Ah, no, no! Mursel, Mursel! I swear we'll soon have nothing. I'm up to here in debt in the village shop. Zarija's recipe has done only harm to us! Now they won't even eat at home! We spent all that money at the hairdressers thinking that our husbands will notice us and they stop going to that bar, but even if we had a star on our forehead, it would all be in vain. The whores have blinded them. Honey, these whores can just eat you shit! Miradije, shut your mouth please! God made us weaker. We cannot stop them, what to do! Weaker? I swear, I only feel sorry for the son, otherwise I'd hang myself! I'd go now to the bar and stick this in each and every one of them, one by one! Stop touching me! Miradije, you are not funny anymore! We didn't do anything, we waited for you to come, to avoid any possible misunderstanding. What happened? -Please, come with me. Lower the body of the dead into his eternal residence, may Allah have mercy upon him! Cover his shame with soil, quick! I don't know what's wrong with him. He's worrying me a lot. He's speaking about things that are about to happen, a minute before they happen. Before all that rain fell, he exclaimed „mom, it's raining“, and not a minute passed and rain started pouring. He sits in the yard and says chicken is falling in the well, and after a minute, a chicken falls into the well. May Allah help him... and keep evil away from him. Put this lucky charm under his pillow. Every night, before he goes to bed, sing this prayer. If he doesn't get better in a week, bring him back to me. Now drink your coffee before it gets cold. It's easier with kids. How to deal with grown ups? Imam is going mad, every day he's locking himself in the barn. He won't allow anyone inside to see what he's doing. When I ask him, he just says: Allah will drown the village, like in prophet Noah's time. It can't get worse than this. The men are spending all their time at the bar. We tried everything we could to stop them, but nothing worked. They say... in order to kill the snake, you must cut its head. As long as you attack it's tail, you won't get anything done. In order to cut the snake's head means we must go and kill that devil Xhinga. No, no. This snake has hidden his head inside the bar. You must go there and cut it. Aha, Aha, aha… I understand. Allah, bless me with profet Noah's gift. I'm sensing that Judgment Day is near. Hello! - Hello! Imam's wife has just arrived with another veiled woman. Where is the Imam? After evening prayers, he went home and did not go out. I left my son watching by his house. Very well, haji. Let me know if something strange happens. Your tip awaits you tomorrow. -Deal. Talk to you later. Grab this devil! Woman, make room! Hana, open the door! Tie him and put him in the henhouse. Don't rush! Push, push! Now we can freely talk why we have summoned you. Imam's wife is with us, and thank God that Imam, knowing our problem, has also come. Imam! Honored sisters, I apologize for showing up in this state. It's never been harder for me in my life… I hope Allah will forgive me because I'm doing all of this for a good cause. Pardon us, Imam! As you know well, the men have taken the devil's path. I've done my best to stop them, my patience is at it's end, and nobody listens to me. You still got us, Imam. We are listening to you. Yes, Yes. -Thank you. Thank God that you, women, still got faith. You've got nothing to lose, so you must organize yourselves to stop the men, because they're up to their throats with infidelity, and they're not stopping. You have my blessing, and Allah will not spare his help for supporting you. The time has come for action, before it's too late, before great God destroys us all. We've tried everything, but nothing can stop them. The whores have possessed their minds. When good will doesn't work anymore, force will. Great Allah allows war when it's purpose is to stop a great evil. Do you understand? -Yes, Yes! I apologize Imam for interrupting you, but we understood what you're trying to say! Women! It's been quite some time since our men have gone crazy, they behave like they don't have homes, wives, children... We are left like widows... It's best for you to become widows… who needs men, anyways, nothing good ever came out of them… Miradije, for God's sake, it's not the place for jokes, so shut up… Where was I... No, I hope we are not left without husbands, because a home with no host gets ruined! I just can't figure out... what those whores have that we don't have?! Maybe theirs is gilded! Maybe those whore's thing is gilded, but our husbands' isn't, at least we are sure about that! It's best to choose the words. I apologize Imam, but my bitter heart is tainting my mouth as well. I propose to go to that devil's bar, take out those whores and... and grab their hairs and drag them to the ground! I say we should burn them with gasoline! We should hang those dirty whores! They deserve to be flayed alive! They stole gold and money from us, because of them our children will have no food to eat. Because of the stupidities of our husbands, I lost my son and Lindita lost her daughter. Only God knows where they are right now. We must stop the men, we must let them know that we also have the right to decide. We are mothers. Yes. Yes. Our children are the light of our eyes, but because of those whores, they're like orphans. We've been patient enough. We've allowed our husbands to drag us by our horns, as if we're animals and not human. Women, let us grab weapons and depart at once... we have tolerated them enough. May Allah bless you! May this business terminate tonight! Good evening! Revolution! C'mon, Avdil, pick it up! Here is the devil's bar, may God punish them! Once we enter, we must stick together. We should not fear our husbands. We should not become weak. I swear, as I feel my blood boiling, I will kill the bastard tonight. The judgment day is here! Imam was right! The judgement day! What is happening? Quickly, get dressed, quickly! Quickly, get dressed. Daut, shame one you! -Fatime! Are you having fun, huh? May God destroy you! Where did you hide the whores? Where? Where are the whores? Where are they? Lule, go home before I kill you in front of everyone. You better kill me than embarrass me like you did. May God destroy you! Are you aware you left your kids at home? Enough, shut it! What's happening Xhinga? How can you do this to me? I loved you so much. Arjeta, let's not talk about these things here. We'll talk once we go home. -What home? This place has been your home for a month now. You spend more time with the whores than with me. Daut, where are the whores? Where did you hide them? -Fatime, I will cut your throat! Leave the whores alone. They're not guilty for any of this. Xharra, where are the whores! Tell me or, I swear, I'll kick you out! Tell me for the sake of the baby I'm carrying in my belly. In the second floor! You're such a lousy man! Let us go. We're not leaving without finishing off the dirty whores. Sokol! Sabit! Fuck, my wife is here too. -And mine? I think all the wives of the world are here. Leave me alone; I've got other things in my mind now. C'mon, we can make a rope with sheet. Let's go before they get here. Make a wall, push them away. If they get away, I'm gonna cut your head off, I swear on my son! Women, push! -You go first. -No, you go first -Thank you. Wait a minute! Congratulations for the daughter! Congratulations to both of us and may our houses be full of grandchildren. Xhinga, c'mon man, we're getting tired. Xhinga! Selki is calling. Selki. C'mon now, don't be afraid! Mursel, you walk ahead of us, and open the way. Hold! Be careful! This way! No, this way! Careful, that's my wife here. Don't start quarrelling with each other now. Push the women away and open the way to the door. Don't touch them, because God has already killed them. Let them leave. Enter, quick, quick... The bar is on fire! You see, this is why our husbands love the whores more than us! Arjeta! Arjeta, I'm sorry! Don't talk to me! I don't ever want to see you! Women, what should we do now? Now we go back home... Miradije, please! No, we are not going back home until we burn down this bloody bar, because if we leave it like this, someday, they might bring those dirty whores back again. Hey, stop it with the foolishness, enough for tonight! Enough for tonight? Enough for tonight? It's not enough! It will be enough once this devil's bar is turned to ashes. Let's burn down the bar… even if we burn the women and the men together. Fatime! -Stop! Hey, stop! Don't do that! Lule, enough for tonight! Do you hear me? Lule! Out! Everyone out, quickly! Fuck this shithole, burn it! Congratulations then! Congratulations! Run, run… What happened? Let's go there! Oh! I will miss this bar. I will miss you too. This bar had a big name! It's smoke is also big. There will be no more fun living in this village, Kica. Hm, the village without the bar will be like a house without a well. Tomorrow the teahouse will be opened again! Yes, tomorrow the teahouse will be opened! Congratulations! -Thank you! Let's go! Mom! -Sweetheart, honey! Why did you run away? Why? It is time to invest in this village! To build one big… casino! Suck my balls! THE END
