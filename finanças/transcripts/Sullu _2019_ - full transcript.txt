[Counting from 66 to 100] 98,99,100... Caught even if you have hidden or not. Caught even if you've hidden behind me. Anu, you're caught. Jithuetta, Achu is coming! Fast! Fast! Jithuetta, stop! Caught! Anu, you start counting. You were caught first. Start counting! - All of you, hide! [Counting from 1 to 100] Go! - This is my place. Go, I say! - I won't go. I came here first. Go! [50, 51, 52....] [97..99, 100] Caught even if you have hidden or not. Caught even if you've hidden behind me. Saw you! Achu, you're caught! I won't count next. 'Sullu' (I give up) Anu! What are you doing here? Is this the time to play? Come! Mom, did you see Jithuettan? He must have gone back home. Go, get into the car. Anu! I give up! Achu! Anu! Achu! Anu! Have you prepared lunch? Yeah. Long back. Only these many of us are here, right? Sister... Why don't we go to Kodaikanal then? Great! As if Manojettan would allow! Why? - Shop to house. House to shop. That's how Manojettan is, now. - Really? Moreover, he's always angry now. He shouts at Jithu and me for anything and everything. Which is this cupboard? This is that old cupboard. We got it repaired by carpenter Mani. Sister... Come here. Tell me how this is. How is it? It's really nice. Is it good? What are you doing here? All of you are playing here? Go outside and play! I bought this for you. Oh no! I don't need it. Jithuetta, you can't do that. Stop! Stop! Jithuetta! Why don't you try something new, Chetta (elder brother)? Why something new? I have the shop, right? Achu, start counting fast. How can you keep going ahead with this shop, Chetta? - First you caught us.... I came to know only when Usha told me. The loan is pending, right? I have repaid the loan. Don't you know Davis Achayan, from Mundakkayam? Achayan's son Sabu had bought our shop. The sales are terrific there. It's in the town, right? How many times did I tell you to buy it? You didn't do anything then, because you were angry. Wouldn't I help you if you need anything? What's the point in saying it now? Since Sabu was smart, he bought that shop. How do you intend to help? With Usha's money? And Mundakkayam Davis Achayan's son! He is really smart. But he made money through his own hard work. And not with his wife's money! Achu! Anu! Achu! Anu! Achu! Anu! Achu! Anu! Achu! Anu! Achu! Anu! Jithu, how many times have I told you not to do this? Mom! Isn't that a living being? I did it to see what would happen to it. Jithu, if you trap a bee inside a bottle, won't it die? What if you're trapped inside a bottle like this? Come here, son. Why are you always upto some mischief? That's why dad keeps hitting you like this, right? Dad doesn't really like me. Jithu! Jithu, wait. Jithu, wait. Come here. Jithu, wait. Did you get your progress card? Did you get it? Then where is it? Where is it? Why didn't you tell me after getting the progress card? Jithu, look at my face. Why didn't you tell me after getting the progress card? Tell me. I forgot. You didn't forget to forge my signature, right? Where do you learn all this from? Tell me. How many subjects did you pass? How many subjects did you pass? Two. - Huh? Two. - Just two? Just two? Just two? If you don't tell me when you get the progress card, ever again... I heard about our son's antics when I met his teacher Joseph on the way. Go inside! Go inside, I say! Hey! Jithu! - Leave me. Come here. - Leave me. Hey! - What is it? What is it? - Shall we take that Laddoo (sweet)? Then I'll push that rice sieve kept outside. Then when mom goes this way, we'll go and get it. I'll be right back. Mom, the rice sieve kept outside has fallen down! Come! Come! Come fast! Open it. Open it! Make it fast! I'm opening it. Mom will come now. Mom has almost reached. - I'm opening it. Make it fast. Mom has reached. Do it fast. Don't be hasty. - Fast. Open it! Jithu! Uncle! Aunt! Dad! Anu! Anybody there? Anu! Achu! Uncle! Anybody there? Jithu! Jithu, wake up! Jithu! Jithu, wake up! It's time! Jithu! Jithu, you'll get it from me now! Wake up! Jithu! Jithu! How long has it been? Go! Shobha! Shobha! - Yes. Where's the lighter I had kept here? It must be there only. I'm asking because I can't find it here! I have work here. Check properly, Manojetta. Jithu! Come and have breakfast! Hey! If I ask you something, will you get angry? First you ask whatever it is. They are all going on a tour today. Babu, Usha and kids. So? Shouldn't we also go somewhere? They both are earning quite a lot every month. Here I'm the only one running around for everything. Jithu! Jithu, come and have breakfast! I've been calling you for so long! That reminds me. Why do you go and say everything to Usha? And he comes asking about that to me, hearing that. I've been wanting to say that to you. Why are you always so angry at Babu? Jithu! He reached this stature, because of my hard work as well. Why are you reading so much into it? You know very well that he didn't mean it that way. Jithu! Aren't you eating? I don't want Idly. Then get up and go! Jithu! Jithu, eat it and go, son. Jithu! Oh my God! Jithu, aren't you coming to play today? Yes. I'll go to the shop and come back. Then come fast. The match will be over soon. Okay. I'll be right back. Brother, two sip-ups. Sachin has come with the bat early in the morning itself, huh? Yeah! I should hit a sixer, right? Hit it out of the park! Don't bother about anything else! Hit it! Brother, give me a cigarette. Can't you see that I'm writing this? Make it fast. - Why are you in such a hurry today? Well, at Prakashan's house... The reception is today. So they need a generator. When I called Babuettan, he said he's going somewhere. So I thought I'll take it right away. Shall I go? I've no time! Add it to my tab! Your tab book is about to overflow. I'm also coming to my uncle's house. Hold it. Careful. Is it heavy? - Of course. It's really heavy. Careful. Open the boot. - Okay. Close it. Okay. See you. We'll be back only after 2 days. Once you're done with it, keep it back here. Okay. I'll keep it. Can't you buy a good car instead of this piece of junk? Okay then! Bye. - See you. Bye. You were standing here? Hey! I've bought a new mobile. We need to set certain things on it. Come inside. This is the phone. Set a new password for it. This phone is awesome! I'll set it right away. Do you want a pattern or a number lock? Number lock is fine. Number lock? - Yes. Set a number that I can remember. It's easy. 2-0-0-8. Otherwise I'd forget that. So will you give me your old phone? Hey! You said that we'll leave at 9.30 AM. It's 10 AM now. Will you be ready anytime soon? You... You keep all this upstairs. Jithu, did you have tea? Tell your mom that we'll be back only after 2 days, okay? Uncle, I'm leaving. - Okay. Jithuetta, will you join us to play hide & seek? Jithuetta, will you join us to play hide & seek? This is the first time I'm coming back half-way from a tour. Don't ever call me for a tour, ever again. Did you hear me? - It's because I got an urgent call! I should throw that phone of yours away, first. Damn phone. - What about the fund? Arrange it quickly, dude. We cancelled the tour and came back home. Do something, man. isn't it better if we repay it as soon as possible? Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! Over here! Aunt! Over here! Aunt! Inside the cupboard! Aunt! Over here. Aunt! Inside the cupboard! How did it come there? Aunt! Inside the cupboard! Aunt! Inside the cupboard! Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! Raji... Raji... - Yes. Did you see Jithu? - No. What about Kuttu? - He left early saying that he's going to play. These kids are always thinking about playing. - True. Here he comes. Now, to relax after his game, he'll watch TV for a while. It would be at least 7.30 PM for him to open his books. It's the same there too. That boy can't remain calm until he gets shouted at by Manojettan. Son, did you see Jithu? Jithu said he'll come to play... No... Jithu said he'll go to the shop & then come to play, but he didn't come. He wasn't there to play? - No. Where has this boy gone? He must be roaming around somewhere. Let me go look for him. - Okay. Is it new? - Yes. I bought it yesterday. Is it gold? - No. Rolled gold. But it doesn't look so, right? - No. It's nice. - Is it? Let me go look for him. - Okay. Bye, son. - Okay. Where are you rushing off to, Shobha? Vasuetta, did you see Jithu? He had come to my shop in the morning with his cricket bat. He left in the morning. He hasn't come back yet. He must be playing cricket at some ground. - I wonder where he is. He must be there somewhere. You check! - Okay. Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Jithu! Mom! Mom! Jithu! Mom! Mom! Mom! Jithu!! - Mom!! Where has this boy gone? Hello! Hello? Hello Usha... Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Damn it! Mom! Mom! Mom! Hello? Manojetta, are you about to leave from the shop? The thing is that... Jithu hasn't come back home yet. No. I searched everywhere. He must be playing games at Chacko's computer shop mostly. Can you pick him up on your way back from the shop? Okay then. Hello? Manojetta... Hello? Give him a dose of scolding too. He only wants to play all the time now. Okay. Hey Suresh. Did Chacko close his shop? - Yes. He left. What happened to your car? - Some b******d did this. Damn it. - Seems like someone did it on purpose. Manojetta, do you have 500 Rupees to spare? I'll see you later. - It's urgent. Babu isn't here, right? I'll return it tomorrow for sure. Okay, brother. Thanks. But still... Manojetta, where is Jithu? He didn't come back yet? He wasn't there at the junction. - No? At the computer shop? - No. The shop is closed. Manojetta, he left in the morning. He hasn't come back yet. Did you check at Kuttu's house? No. He hasn't gone there. Manojetta, I'm getting scared. You scolded him in the morning as well. Where did he... Don't be scared. Try calling his other friends. Let me go and look for him. Call me if he comes back. Check if he's at the bakery. Manojetta, Jithu hasn't come yet? Raji told me. No. I'm going to look for him. Wait. I'll also come. It's okay Satheeshan. No. I'll also come. Kuttu, get me that torch. What is it at this hour, Satheeshan? What is it, Manoj? Joseph, had Jithu come here? Jithu? He hasn't come this way. What's the matter? Well, he hasn't come back home yet. Oh no! It's okay. He might have come back now. Wait. I'll also come. It's okay. We will search. Call me if something comes up. No. I looked there too. Did you check behind our house? Check once again. Okay. I'll call you. Yes. Satheeshan is with me. Manoj... Did anyone come to your house this morning to sell anything? We can't trust anyone. The times are such! Satheeshan, come. Did you inform the police station? - Yes. There's no point in informing them. We'll search at the bus stand. The boys will search here. On the way, search at the pond and the river too. Okay. Manojetta, stop. Joseph is calling. Joseph, one minute. Hello? Hello? Yes! I can hear you. Okay. What is it? His son saw at Jithu at Kavumpuram while he was playing in the morning. He left pretty soon as well, apparently. Jithu, you passed in just two exams? Just two? - Then get up and go! Go inside! If you don't tell me about the progress card ever again... Manojetta! Shall we enquire at his friends' houses? Come. Let's go once again and check. Careful. Where has he gone? Manojetta, you get down. I'll ride the bike. Jithu! Oh my God! Hello? Hello Babuetta! I've brought that generator back. Is it okay if I keep it in front of the house? But it's locked, right? Where is the key then? Just a second. Let me check. Yes, I got it. Okay. I'll keep this inside then. Okay then. Bye. Where are you going now? - Our Jithu is missing. Our Jithu has been missing for a while. Did you see him anywhere? - No. Didn't you enquire at his friends' houses? He's not there. He's not there? Come, let's go. Just a second. Babuettan is calling. Hello? Yes, Babuetta... Yes. I've kept it. I've kept the key under the doormat. And yeah... Hello? Our Jithu has been missing since evening. Yes. Manojettan is here. Yes, I'll put him on. It's Babuettan. Yes. No. He left to play, in the morning. No! No! You don't have to come back. I've informed the police. Yes, I'll let you know. Come, let's go. Let me know! Did you get any information, Satheeshetta? We checked everywhere he could have gone. You don't worry like this. We've informed the police, right? Or else, wait and watch. He will come tomorrow morning. This is just to scare us. I've also done stuff like this during childhood, out of rage. Kids, right? Shall we leave then? We'll come tomorrow morning. Call me if you need anything. I shouldn't have gotten angry at him in the morning. When have you not gotten angry at him? You vent out your ego against everyone else, on him! Am I venting my anger on him? It was for him to get rid of his mischief and carelessness, and to grow up smart! Do you think he will become smart, if you get shout at him whenever he opens his mouth? He's getting worse! My son! It's not all that. Why do you have so much ego against your younger brother? Isn't he the only one we have, to seek help from, when we have a problem? Look! Look at Satheeshan! Wasn't he with you all this while? They stay right next door! Have you ever talked to him? Have you ever smiled at him? Have you even looked at him? And when we were in need, only they were there to help us! Why do you do this, Manojetta? Whom are you showing all this anger to? Where has my son gone? Hello. Hello, Chetta? Any information about Jithu? No. Why don't you check in the premises of my house? There's no place left here to look for him. Before we left yesterday, the kids were playing near the well yesterday. I told them not to play over there. But still, we shouldn't let that doubt remain, right? Not because something would have happened. But still, why don't you... What? What is it, Manojetta? Hey Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Hey Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Is he there, Kuttu? No. He's not here. Come. Jithu! Jithu! Jithu! Mom! Mom! Mom! Don't cry, Shobha. We'll find him. Where is my son? Don't cry. Jithu! Jithu! I think Jithu is over here. Shobha! Shobha! Satheeshan! Satheeshan! [Counting from 1 to 100] 97.. 98... 99... 100. Caught even if you have hidden or not. Caught even if you've hidden behind me.
