(relaxing music) - You always need to wax for traction, make sure you got plenty stability. Stability for it. You don't need to wax the tip, like they used to do in the old days, these boards are to short to stand on the tip. It always seems like there's three kinds of surfers. You have the guy who's a local, who kind of controls how everybody thinks about him, so he doesn't really care what people think, cause he already knows what they're thinking. And then you got the poser, who constantly worries about what people think of him, cause that's why he is a poser, he tries to change how people think about him. And then just have guys like me, who just kind of don't care, kind of stuck in between. My name's Morgan and my mom picked my name, from a movie called Morgan. It's a pretty good movie. Kind a wish life was kinda like that movie, just unserious and funny. (relaxing music) - Morgan. - Yeah? - I got a letter from your mother, she said to say hi. - Oh alright man. - [Voiceover] Got a burger, no onions Bobby. - [Bobby] Alright. - Hey Dad, I'm going surfin'. - [Dad] Surfing? - [Morgan] Yeah. - Did you clean your room up? - [Morgan] Ah no. - [Dad] You didn't clean your room? Did you lock up? Look you gotta, you know, people want out like having a good time, all the time, I want you to make some money, you got rent due, 50 bucks by the end of this week. Think about that. - [Morgan] I think, I'll get it to you, I'll get it to you. - [Dad] Ok. - Alright. - [Dad] Alright see you later. (whir) - No kiddin' man. - Why don't we go to the beach one of these days, you know take our. - Take our turn right. I'd just like to see him get a job, you know make a little more money. - [Carol] How old is he anyway? - He's gonna be 18 in about a week. - [Carol] Really? - Yeah. - [Carol] Big kid. - Big kid, and he drinks a lot of milk too, I tell ya. I tell ya a gallon a day. - [Leon] What's the surf like today Morg? - [Morgan] I'll know soon as I, it's gonna be pretty good. - [Leon] Where are we going? - [Morgan] I don't know, I just, I just heard of this little spot, I hope the surfs, I hope the surf is like you know, gonna be pretty big. - [Leon] Yeah, I'm pretty psyched I just hope, it's not to cold. - [Morgan] Rach, it's gonna be good. - [Rachel] Better be. - [Morgan] Man remember when we used to catch lizards, up at camp on the rocks, baking themselves in the sun. - [Rachel] I wish we could be here before any kind of, civilization, maybe there was surf back then. - [Morgan] All the indians were here. - [Voiceover] Not much surf huh? - Hey look, what are you doin' with that thing? - [Voiceover] Making a movie of myself. - What? - I like to fool around with camera's and stuff, I like to shoot things. What are you guys doing out here? - What do you think? - Not surfing. - How come you have that thing on a stick? - I don't know, it lets me take a picture, of the top of my head, and of me walking around. Here, see you can hold it, and photograph down on yourself. In fact I have to go. Here, hang onto this. Just bring it by my house on Friday, when you're done with it, we'll take a look at it. Address is on the stick. - [Morgan] On the stick? - Yeah have fun. - How do you know we'll bring it back? - If you don't, I'll shoot you. - What? Hey wait, where on the stick? 42 Crest. Hey, what, what city is it in? What city? (relaxing music) - I had this kinda weird dream, it was about um, about me being pregnant. (laughing) I thought I was pregnant and, and I was gonna um, have a boy and a girl, and that they were inside in my, inside my, um testicles. (laughing) And that, it's kind of a weird dream but, and they started to grow and grow, and I couldn't even get out of bed to go to school, and it was almost like elephantitis, and I felt like I had to carry them with like, little hang down backpacks. (laughing) And, and finally right, before they were gonna be born, and it would like relieve all the pain and pressure, I woke up and what was strange is that they hurt, for a couple days. Isn't that weird? - Yeah. - Couldn't believe it . (laughing) It's kinda funny huh? You know um, right up here on this very hill about 1903, this guy named Bott's he was one of the first attempts, at a, at a logical flying machine, and he would have, beat the Wright brothers. But a really strong storm blew his plane over. But I mean you can go even further back than that, when there used to be indians all over this whole area, speaking a 1000 different dialects, just within this bay area. - [Rachel] How come you're so interested in all this old stuff, about everything? - [Morgan] It just seems like by reading about it, you kind of make space in your mind. (wind blowing) I think, I think what really brought me, and Rachel together was spending a lot of time with um, with her just communicating while she had her tonsils out, for two weeks she was at home and couldn't talk, so we had to communicate with her writing and me talking, and I think it kind of developed a, developed us, a keen sense of um, keen sense of feeling for one another, rather than just, you know, just verbal, verbal conversation. We kind of sensed each other more. And what I really noticed was that um, Rachel, Rachel's a really sweet, a really sweet person, and I was attracted by that, by that, I, just a really sweet part of her, I was attracted by that, and just being, being, spending more and more time with her, I got closer and closer to her. I think one of the, one of the things that really, I appreciate about her is um, her eyes are really, like really big baby, baby brown eyes. Everybody says baby blue eyes, but I like baby brown eyes. And they're just, they have a lot of character to them, even though a lot of people like blue eyes, I like brown eyes. I think they have a lot of character to them. Besides the fact she has her, she has a really nice body, and she's um, she's got a cute smile. Um, I haven't, I haven't really had the feeling, that. I haven't really had the feeling that I met Rach, Rachel, in a past life or anything, but I kinda feel like, I kind of feel like that, that I could deal with her in a, in a future life, such as, you know having kids, and getting married and possibly dealing with, something like that. I think that um, I think that she really is able to um, to develop that way. - [Dad] Hey, I thought I told you to put that ah, I thought I told you to bring that back? - I am don't worry about it, I'm gonna bring it back on Friday. - [Dad] Well hey I don't want it broken or anything, cause I don't want to pay. - Don't worry it's not gonna get broken, I promise. I mean I'm just gonna bring it back on Friday. Hey what are you draw, oh that's a nice drawing. - Oh thank's, you know this is a test I took, when I was about your age. Here which of these three images and there's six of 'em, do you think go together? Do you see that? - [Morgan] That looks like the oil can and the wrench, and the jeep go together. - [Dad] Well that's where you're ah that would get you, right into the US Army buddy. Cause that's the test I took then. - That intelligence test. - That's the intelligence test that'll get you right in there pal. - To distinguish between a jeep, a wrench and a chicken? - Yeah. - What's the oil for? - You'll probably end up in the motor pool working on jeeps, you won't be flying those jet engines like Top Gun or any of that stuff in this man's army. - Top Gun? What, oh yeah that movie. - That movie. - Oh that came out about three years ago now. - Yeah. - That's pretty interesting. - I'm doing a series on these, I'm remembering all those times because it's coming close. - Yeah so Dad, I mean, did you ever do that kind of stuff, I mean. - Well I had to go for my physical examination, you know, like you're going to have to go register for the draft right? - Yeah that's true. - And then sooner or later, they're gonna use you right? To serve in the military and you gotta go for your physical. Now me I avoided that as long as possible. - How'd you. - Well first I was a student. - Yeah. - And that's why I want you to study and get into a college, or something see you get into. - Well I mean that's what I'm gonna do, I mean that's what I plan just to make, get some money and then go to school after I get some money. - Ok but if you're not in school right away see, they're gonna get ya. And you don't answer the questions like this when you go. If you wanna stay, you gotta make a decision, whether you wanna go in, now sure basic training is good, for anybody but to go around know how to kill, and go get killed and go and fight in wars where they just blow whole cities up in no time at all, you know. I wouldn't wanna be on a ship and they send a missile over, and they just blow you up, that's not fighting. You know that's what today's army's all about. - Well I mean the only way I feel about it, is if somebody came knocking on my door, ready to blow me away, maybe then I might fight back but, other than that I don't feel like being sent off to some little country for something that I don't even believe in. - That's for sure, ok well now we gotta work on this. We gotta work on getting you outta here, ok? Conscientious objectors, that's fine but if there's a war, they're gonna put you right up in the front line anyway. Flying down a helicopter picking up all the butchered parts. - So I mean, how'd you get out of it? - Well like I said, for six years I went through two S, I got the student, and I even got married, I got married a year and a half before I wanted to get married, and then they took married guys anyway, so. - They were taking married people? - Yeah they take married guys too. In a real state of emergency, they don't care if you have children or anything. They just take ya. So you gotta go and prepare yourself, you gotta say to yourself, I'm not going to be involved with any government projects for the rest of my life, that's the only way you're gonna get out of it. No military, no government projects, and then they don't care if you're an individual, you can be a crazy man, that's how you get out. - What do you mean, a crazy man? - Well you get a doctor to say you're crazy. - Well how'd, I mean is that what you did? - Yeah, i got a letter, I got a two page letter. - Two pages about. - Yeah and it only took 35 dollars and one half hour for this guy to write a letter. Course I was doing drama you know art school and everything, So I knew how to act you know, it was a little bit like street theater. - Well, what type of street theater? I mean what were you doing? - Well let's say you come in to the, you go into the doctor's office, and you look as crazy as you can ok? Well you gotta wear two different kinds of socks, not a pair, two different kinds, two different kinds of shoes then that really throws them off. And those mad dress bermuda's got no holes in the pockets, so if you put anything in it they fall right down your leg, and it also have a slit right up your rear end, and it's gotta be ripped opened. And you go into the army induction place like that. Now I'm going for my physical but before I go in my physical I have my letter from my psychiatrist, I've got this dress going on, I take LSD three days straight, I don't wash, I don't shave, I don't sleep. I eat turkey and beans. And then when you get on the bus, you become the first guy on the bus right? And then everybody who comes on the bus, they smell you, they do, they can smell your sweat, they can smell your farting, and you let them smell you, and then you be friendly, you say here take my seat. You know they didn't want to sit down where I was, and then you get up and you give the seat away anyway, and you walk off the bus, and you're the first one off the bus and the first one into the room. To start taking your tests. Now there was nobody else in this room except me and this sargent, and I said 'Could I help you do something sarg?' and he says 'Sure you can hand out pencils and paper, to each of the desks.' And so I did that, and all the other guys came in, and he handed out the test booklets to them, and he's looking at his clock you know, and he says 'Ok we're gonna begin now, does everybody have their things?' And then half the room raises their hand and says 'I don't have any pencils' and the other half says 'I don't have any paper.' And he's looking at me right? And I says, I stood up and I said 'You told me to put a pencil on each desk, and a paper on the other.' He says 'No a pencil and paper on each desk.' You know, so you screw everything up, you try and help and you screw things up, this is what you do. Now when I got down to the taking blood, I told them I didn't want anybody taking my blood, and I marked down on a piece of paper, that I wouldn't, that I had all these terrible experience about you know, when I had my polio shots I cringed up so bad that the needle snapped off in my arm, and they had to pull it out with pliers, and I would have fainting spells and everything, but they said 'No, no, no you gotta take your blood.' So I waited til everybody had their blood taken, and I'm approaching the thing, now you're in your underwear, and of course you put brown stains in your underwear, this is you know. And you walk there, and you walk down there like nothings happening, and everybody does want you in the back of the line, they don't you standing next to ya. They want you down there, walking down there. So I get up to the iron, there's this iron screen that they have you know, it'a s white iron thing on wheels, and it's got a curtain and there's a little table there with all little bottles of blood and a guy in a lab coat, he's taking the blood. So I said 'please don't, don't put a needle in me, I don't like needles in me.' And he like sticks it in me and I faint, you know, and I do this dramatic faint where I knock over the thing, the big iron thing and it crashes down on the table, and knocks over all the test tubes, all the blood, and everything and they had to bring back everybody. When I woke up I was on a cot, when I woke up all the guys were up again, standing in line in their underwear gonna get their blood taken all again. I said 'so you're not being friendly', see, so then you go down to the next department, and all the time the guy in the lab coats checking off things on my envelope, you know, he's like checking things off, he says 'oh I see here you wrote down, that you bleed from inside your penis, and outside your penis, and all your holes, you bleed from, you got it checked off that. where do you bleed from?' I said 'I bleed from all these places.' And then he says 'well what's this you bleed blood, from the inside of your penis or the outside?' I said 'well i don't know which part you know, cause some of it seems to be friction burns.' Yeah you gotta tell this stuff. So anyway by this time they got me, the psychiatrist, I know the guys name, his name was Captain Silver and I went in there, and I go 'hey laddie, hey laddie', you know, Captain Silver remember that Treasure Island? Now he's going to open the letter up, and it said, it said something about me being a paranoid schizophrenic it also said I couldn't take any orders from anybody, I hated authority figures and also, I lived in an ivory tower, and this was the best part, incapable, I was incapable of love. You know, cause if you can't love your mother, your wife, your family, your country, you can't be killing people either. You understand? So, I tell ya you kinda get out. And then at the end they had me, you know spread your cheeks, you know. They did, they said 'bend over, grab your ankles, and spread your cheeks' you know so. The guy's looking, he's got rubber gloves or something, he's looking down there he says 'what's that?' and I says 'well what?' and he looks down at it and I said 'well that's peanut butter' and I took my finger and went down there, and I say 'you want some? It's great hot' you know. So, like after all this, you know the letter, the thing, I said I was a junkie, I said I was a homo, I said everything to get out of it, you know what they found out? - [Morgan] What? - They found out that I had flat feet, and they didn't want me anyway. (laughing) Anyway so that's why you know, like in this test, I put down these three things go together, the chicken, the light bulb, and the rubber band and I say 'everybody knows you need a rubber band to tie up the chicken's leg when you screw the light bulb in, they all go together.' So if you want to get out bad enough you can. That's a little advice for you. (bang) - [Voiceover] How's it going there? Got a washer, dryer combo for ya huh? - [Voiceover] A washer, dryer and a refrigerator. - [Voiceover] Ah well your refrigerator. (bang) - [Voiceover] Thank you and there better be a refrigerator up there. (bang) - [Morgan] Alright take her down. (bang) - [Voiceover] Right over here. Set it down. Set it up so it's standing, we got a rug here in the way we need to pick it up. Ready? - [Morgan] Ready, go. - [Voiceover] Turn it towards the door, there you go, set it down. Wrong door, there you go. - [Morgan] Could I get your signature. - [Voiceover] Uh huh, when I called up and asked for delivery I gave them both items, and they were both set up for Willcall. Yeah and? Well what do I do now? Ah, over a week ago, it was before the fourth of July weekend. - [Morgan] Yeah they shouldn't do that to you, you know. We just work for the driving company so. - [Voiceover] Alright, I want that refrigerator, when am I going to get it? How bout Tuesday? Patience is a virtue. Yes? (screeching) (banging) - Well basically water, why did I ever get involved in it, basically it's a lot of water. Ah water, sky, shadows, lots of shadows, and it's huge. Well it's huge for me anyway. - And the shadows are across the top or underneath? - They're all over. It's got um, it's called pool reflection and it has pieces of a pool plus the sky, plus the reflection. - Oh god. - This is nice by the way. - Well thanks. Trying to learn more about myself. - Ah huh. - But an excuse, an excuse to solve another problem I guess. - I gave, talking about problems I gave Morgan your message. And he almost didn't respond. - Well, I should probably talk to him. - I think you should. - I don't know, I've been so busy I, I ah. - Well you know if you don't see him now it's gonna be much harder when you move. - Yeah I keep thinking well I still have some more time and yeah I don't really feel like it, I guess I'm still mad or I don't know working things out. - Well I just think you should talk to him. I'm concerned about him, I'm concerned about him. - Well I just don't know. (whir) - [Leon] Morg, look at this. 'the Canadian Mounted Police do in Canada what's done here, by the FBI, the secret service, the border patrol, the highway patrol, the local police and even part of the CIA'. Wow, CIA too. 'A panel of doctors recently decreed, that more than half of the 20 million plus hysterectomies in the 1970's were unjustified'. Man 20 million plus hysterectomies, that should be illegal. Why, look at this Morg, 'why it's against the law to make a pastry reproduction of the White House, I do not know but that's reported as a fact'. I wonder why is that. Or look 'mallard ducks commit rape'. What's up Dad? - [Leon's Dad] Hey, what' going on? Where'd you get that? Is that a birthday present or something? Fancy. - No, it', a friend of mine, well actually not a friend of mine this guy I saw walking down the beach, was just like fiddling with this stick here, he had it up on the top like that, and I just asked him hey what are you doing? And he said nothing just filming, and then all of a sudden he had to leave and he goes here, here, here is my camera, I gotta go, I gotta go. - [Leon] And he just walked away and left it with Morgan. - Trusting fella. Well when I was draft age, nobody considered dodging, excuse me, nobody considered trying to avoid registering, what they were trying to avoid was the draft. And what I did then was refused to sign the loyalty oath, they had several court cases at that time that said, if you fail to sign the oath that was their problem not yours, so that's what I did, and then I went out of my way to look publicly red. Peace demonstrations and other kind of thing I could. And eventually they decided they didn't want me, took 'em about a year but I wasn't at all sorry. - Nick. - What's up Morg, what are you doing? - Leon I don't think we should do this. - Why not we're going to make five bucks an hour. - No I don't feel like doing it. - This guy Nick's really cool too, he's a forward thinker, anything you need he's got it in his garage. Five bucks Morg, no taxes. Nick are you back there? Nick. Nick are you back there? - Yeah I'm over here boys. Hey how you doing? - Alright, are you alright? - Yeah I'm alright I just. - Are we gonna work? - Yeah we're gonna be chopping some fennel today. - Oh, I brought my friend Morgan is that alright? - That's fine. - Then I'll go get the tools. - [Nick] Ok Leon you know where they are in the shop. - Yeah. - [Nick] Ok. (creaking) Hi Morgan, Nick's my name. - [Morgan] Nice to meet you. - Yeah nice to meet you. - [Morgan] Some clippers here. - [Leon] Yeah. - [Morgan] Man check out that grenade. - [Leon] Yeah wonder if we'll need this for the trimming. - [Morgan] Yep that grenade will, that'll work. - [Nick] You guys about ready for lunch? Huh? You guys ready for some beverages? - [Morgan] What's that? - [Nick] Well this is a little ginseng cocktail I thought you might like with royal jelly. - [Morgan] Is it cold? - [Nick] It's not cold, it's usually drunk at room temperature. - It looks like old heroin bottles or something. - [Nick] Well this keeps it fresh you know. - [Leon] These are cute little straws. - [Nick] Yeah, here we go. Leon. - [Leon] Thanks, royal jelly. - [Nick] It's good for what ail's ya. - [Leon] Well Morgan's been thinking about whether or not to register. - [Morgan] Leon man hey, that's not, I mean that's not everybody's business. - Man come on. - What's the beef you guys? - I mean I don't have nothing against Nick, but I mean it's just like, I don't think that everybody should, I mean, it's not, they don't have to worry about me. I just feel like the registering just starts dragging you in that's just the first given to the whole system of people getting killed when they don't even know what it's for. - [Nick] You could end up down in Nicaragua. - I don't want to end up killing some little kid or get my nuts blown off in Nicaragua. - [Leon] Morg, do you want to go to college? - Of course, I mean everybody wants to go to college. - [Leon] Well you can't get financial aid if you don't register for the draft. - I mean that, that's part of the problem. I mean that's what inhibits a lot of people, that's what's, I mean partly inhibits me. That's what I'm thinking about, that's what's pressuring me. - [Leon] Well, I'm gonna have to be going now, I gotta cut. - [Nick] Ok. - [Morgan] Alright then Lee. - [Leon] Alright take it easy Morg. - [Morgan] Good working with you today. - [Nick] Thanks for your help. - [Leon] No problem. - [Nick] We'll settle up later ok? - [Leon] Yeah no problem. Next Friday? - [Nick] Yeah fine we could use the work. - [Leon] Alright see you. - [Nick] Ok look forward to it. - Rachel have you ever heart the expression 'having your cake and eating it to'? - Do you mean 'you can't have your cake and eat it to'? - Yeah that's right, that's right. - Yeah everyone's heard that. - Um I mean, if you're wondering why I'm asking you, the reason why is cause if you have your cake why can't you eat it? Why can't you eat your cake? Why can't you eat it? - You can. - When are you going to stop doing that? - [Morgan] Doing what? - [Rachel] Stop it I hate it when, you've been doing that all this time. (relaxing music) - [Rachel] What is that? - [Morgan] I don't know, it's just a letter. What is this? What the hell is this? - [Rachel] What are they talking about? - [Morgan] 'Dear Morgan it is my privilege to inform you that you've been drafted into the United States Army for the purpose of defending our shores in South America and Iran against the red menace. Congratulations. The President of the United States.' (whirring) - Mom needs the blow dryer. Mom needs the blow dryer. - What? - Mom needs the blow dryer! - Oh alright. Just wait a second I'm almost done. - She needs it now. - Now? - Now. - I was almost done, oh well. - She needs it, thank you. - [Rachel's Dad] How you doing Morgan? - [Morgan] I'm ok. - [Rachel's Dad] That's good. Alright, you know this reminds me of when you go down to L.A. and by Coalinga there's this huge feed lot. The smell is about a mile or two before you get to it, but they've got 1000's and 1000's of beef out there. - [Morgan] Big beef huh? - [Rachel's Dad] Big beef. Cholesterol city by the highway. - [Morgan] Those look good. - [Rachel's Dad] Indeed they do. (babbling water) - I got an announcement. Rachel's gonna move in. (sarcastic laughing) - You are? - I don't think so. - But Rachel, I mean we can make it don't worry. - Forget about it. - There's plenty of space. - Pah! - [Rachel's Mom] You're moving in over my dead body. - Don't worry Mom I don't want to. - [Rachel's Mom] Fine, where'd you get this idea anyway? - She's pregnant. - [Rachel's Sister] What! - [Rachel's Mom] I think there's a few other alternatives we could consider here rather than moving into that. Where do you live? - The hell hole? - [Rachel's Dad] I think you're pretty young to get tied down with kids and all that. - [Rachel's Mom] Do you want to have the baby? - [Rachel's Dad] Ah I'm gonna turn off the fountain it's driving me nuts. - [Rachel's Mom] Good idea. - Are you really pregnant? - [Rachel's Mom] Are you? - Yes. - [Rachel's Mom] Great. - Why didn't you tell mom? - [Rachel's Mom] Why didn't you use birth control? - I did tell her, I am telling you guys. - But why didn't she tell her before hand? It's Rachel's place to tell her, not yours. - Maybe we did use birth control. - That was her question. - [Rachel's Mom] Maybe you used a crummy kind, what'd you use? - Rubbers don't always work. - [Rachel's Mom] Great. How pregnant are you? - What do you mean how pregnant am I? - [Rachel's Mom] I mean how many periods have you missed? - Four. - [Rachel's Mom] Four, shit! Ah, have you been to a doctor? - No. - [Rachel's Mom] Planned parenthood, anything? - No. - You're in deep shit. - [Rachel's Mom] Four months, you're sure, you've missed four whole periods? Maybe they better move in together. - Maybe they better get married. - That's why I brought it up. - [Rachel's Mom] So how you gonna do it? - I got a job. - How you gonna eat? - I got a job. - What job? - I got a job. - What job? - I have a couple jobs. - What jobs? - i painted your bathroom. You still haven't paid me for that. - Morgan I only have two bathrooms, I'll pay you for the damn bathrooms but I don't think you guys can support yourselves on painting my bathrooms ok? - I lift refrigerators. - You mean you steal refrigerators? - No lift like as in pick up. - Deliver. - Oh well how much do you make doing that? - A lot. - What about college? What about high school you're not even finished with high school? - So? - What do you mean so? - Are you gonna finish? - What kind of parent do you think you're going to be if you don't even have a high school education? Who's Albert Schweitzer? - I don't know. - That's the kind of thing you need to know. - Rach, this isn't funny you know, I don't think it's funny. - I don't think it's funny either I'm glad you at least know that. - I mean I've thought about it very seriously, it affects my life just as much as it does yours. Yours probably even more so, you shouldn't even be it's not even a funny subject. - Listen I have a question. Do you want the child? Have you thought about it? - No. - I've thought about it a lot. I want it if she does but if she doesn't I'll support her in that way too. But somethings gotta be done. I don't even know if they'll let you get an abortion. - I don't know either I think you can get one up to about five months, but it's not going to be fun if you're four months pregnant. - I'm cold I'm going in. - That's a good idea. I'm cold too. (burbling) - [Morgan] Yeah are we going to have any work today? I mean, what? That was the warehouse's fault. Wait a minute that wasn't our fault. Two weeks! What about my truck? They're gonna repo it, guaranteed. What about my rent? They're gonna kick us out. Alright, well I'll give you a call later man. Alright, you're sorry? Well I under yeah I'm sorry to. (chug, chug) - So Daphne is Apollo's first love, but she's not interested and he chases her through the forest and she asks her father, the river god, to protect her and he turns her into a laurel tree and she's, I'm trying to paint this stopping dead in the tracks, she's rooted into the earth and the whole problem is this tension between the two characters, I'm trying to get. - What is she doing, running away from his love? Or what? - Yeah that's what's happening. - Really seems like she's trying to escape there. - Yeah, cause she's immortal. - Yeah. - So um, I'm moving. - What? - I decided to go to New York. - For what? I mean, I thought you were doing pretty good out here. - Ah can't send my work, I just, I need to think about myself for a while and try to. - Yeah that's true you do need to think about yourself. - Take care of my own problems. - Well I mean, what's your problems? I mean I got problems too, I mean, my girlfriend she's probably pregnant, you know. You know what the hell am I supposed to do? I mean we all got problems but that doesn't mean we need to run at the first sign of problems. I mean sometimes you just gotta stick in there. I mean maybe you should have stuck in there when, you know we used to live together. I really feel, you know bad about that. - Well you can't psych yourself up so much, you know, you gotta, sometimes you just gotta jump around like that gorilla in the movie, and. - But am I, I mean am I supposed to accept that as like a real abstract way to deal with my problems? - That's all I, that's really all I can. - That's all the advice you have? - That's all I can tell you. I don't know how to do it myself. - For all I know it's a good idea, it might work. Well I really hope you have a good time you know, with going to New York. Don't screw yourself up to much. Me and Dad we'll be alright. I better go. I love you, see you later. - Ok. (radio music) - [Nick] Mhm, that stuff. Ah, how you doing Morgan? - Alright how are you? - Ok I'm glad you would come over and give me a hand with this stuff. I've gotta be doing some repair work here. Hope you don't mind if I work on this while we talk. - No it's kinda neat just playing around with this stuff here. - Well how's your family doing? What's your dad do? - It's alright, he ah, he's a professional artist. - That sound interesting. What kind of work does he do? - Well he does have to work a part time at this nice restaurant, just to cover his half of the bills, we kinda split the bills you know. - A lot of artists have to work, it's hard to make a living being an artist in this culture you know, it's just hard you know. My dad. - Yeah what did your dad do? - Well my dad was a mechanical guy and he worked a lot. He worked for the telephone company. And he was a good hard working guy you know, but they just took advantage of him and screwed him and it basically it killed him. He couldn't do what he wanted he always thought you know he was going to get to do what he wanted and. - Like how'd it turn out? - Well he had a heart attack and died, he was basically just a victim of a lot of stress you know. - Did he drink or smoke or. - No he didn't drink, he smoked a little when he was younger but it wasn't anything, you know he seem to be in good health. Was 50 years old he keeled over dead. - So he like worked really hard looking forward to retiring and then just kind of over worked himself? - Well the company you know they squeeze you between, you know you work for the company and you try and do a good job and you know they take advantage of you, it's just hard to make a go of it cause they're basically trying to exploit whatever you have. He had a lot of skills and he was handy with his hands and stuff and I learned a lot of that from him. But I decided this wasn't going to happen to me, I was going to be independent you know. - But he, I mean, he made good money though you guys lived well didn't you I mean you had the bills paid. - Yeah but I'd rather have my father than have the bills paid you know the bills will always take care of themselves really, you know there's always some way it's going to work out. - Yeah you're right you're right. - And so the important thing I think is to have your integrity you know and let the rest of it flow. You know, it'll work out ok. I think if anything I'd rather have my dad here you know, than any money that we made or could have made or insurance or anything else, it's just bull shit otherwise so. - I don't understand that, I mean on one level I understand but on another level it just seems really, I don't know for some people I guess it's a worth it trade off to have the bills paid and alleviate that stress. - Well the whole culture tries to convince you that that's the trade off that the thing is to have all this stuff, you know. - It's ok to have that stress. - Yeah that the stress is not going to hurt you, the stress is worthwhile, stress is something you live with, stress is no big deal, but it's a big deal, I know it is, I could see it in my dad you know. I could see the problems he'd bring home from work with him when. - Do you ever gotta refuel that sucker? - Yeah did I ever show you how this works? - No, show me how, I saw kinda how it worked but I didn't. - Well you, you put this cap on here, and then you get this thing, this is just regular lighter fluid stuff you know, (whoosh) and you fill it up like that. (laughing) (relaxing music) - Seems like a pretty rich neighborhood. - Man look at that house, isn't that nicely shingled? - Yeah, 78, 78. - That's really cool. - Maybe that guy's pretty rich. - 70 there's 70. - That guy was wearing you know a suit and everything. - Here comes 64. - Check out that balcony up there. - 52. - This is a rich neighborhood, 42, look crest. - There it is 42 crest. - Pull into the driveway. - Nah we better not we might block it or something, we should go around and park. 42 Crest. - Look at all these houses, look at those, those must be worth millions. - Not millions but like half a mil, almost a mil. - I've never seen houses this big before. - There it is 42 Crest. Geez that's such a big house. - I know. - That's hella big. - You could fit two of your rooms in just that garage. - More than that, come on let's go. (relaxing music) - Great you guys made it, I thought there were three though, and you brought the camera back. - [Morgan] Yeah the bracket is screwed. - That's alright I made a new one anyway, I was going to try it out. Why don't you come on in and I'll show it to you. - [Morgan] Alright, alright. - Right over here. - Here you want to take this? - [John] Yeah. This is the new one I got. - [Morgan] The new what? - [Voiceover] Should work much better with a new bracket. Maybe later on we'll try it out. - Rach, Rach. - My name's John by the way. - Yeah, my name's Morgan, that's right we didn't meet. - Rachel. - How you doing Rachel. Well why don't you guys take a look around the place a little bit, I'll be right back. Make yourselves at home. - I thought that was real for a second, when we first came in. - Yeah me too. - What's this thing Morgan? - Looks like some type of bomb shell head or something. Look at that picture, it's cool. When I look around the room and I look at all the things in this room, I feel as if I'm sharing this room, or this room is my own, and I wonder how many hours it would take for me to own all these things here. It took me five hours just to purchase this watch, five hours of work. I wonder how many hours it would take for me to just own one square foot of this ceiling, but for right now Rachel and I we kind of feel at home here as if it's ours, these few moments together in here. - [John] How's it going? - Oh alright man. - Guys look around a little bit? - Yeah we were just getting comfortable looking around, it's a really nice place. - Alright, maybe later we can take a look at some of the footage we did with the camera. - [Morgan] Look at Rachel, her little cute smile looking up. - [Rachel] I look funky. - [Morgan] You don't look funky. - [John] That stick worked really well, I'm really happy with it. - [Morgan] Yeah just the bracket was kind of weird. - [John] Yeah I got a better one for that. You didn't get Leon in the picture. - No. Look at the water coming up like that. - You can almost see the sticks shape. - [Rachel] I look stupid. - [John] That's nice bringing it down like that, that looks really weird. - [Rachel] That's what we were trying to. That's where, right there is where we were trying to find your address on the stick. - [Morgan] Yeah you had to take, you took off so quickly. - [Rachel] That's Leon. - [John] What was that flicker you think? - [Morgan] I don't know. It's kinda hard to believe that, that we live in this small, what a lot of people would call pitiful room. More space in my bed. Its kinda cool, although Dad's spot is kinda cramped. But at least his can be kind of like a bed, it's elevated. - I'm gonna be truthful with you Morgan. Kay my feelings about the draft is this, I graduated from high school in 1968 in Berkeley, that was probably the height of the Vietnam confrontation. I was from a family of seven, five boys and two sisters. Two of my brothers got drafted, before I got out of high school. The first two that went died in Vietnam. I didn't go because I was a conscientious objector, and I was prepared to go to jail rather than go. Not because I was scared, because I did not agree with what was happening. Don't get me wrong, America is my country, this is where I was born, I wasn't born in Africa, I wasn't born in Arabia, I have just as much interest, in this country as the next person, because my forefathers died here, lived here and died here. But I will fight for this country. (whirring) - I couldn't marry anyone until I was at least 25. I mean if you're, you need a chance to be a teenager, and just fuck up and stuff, you can't be married, and responsible when you're only 16 or 18 or whatever. You have to have lived a little and have fucked up a lot. And I think that most teenagers do fuck up, and that's how they learn from all their mistakes. If you've never had a chance to make those mistakes, then how can you have a marriage that will work? Then that marriage itself is a mistake. - [John] I'll be right down in a minute. How's the water? How's it going? - It's pretty cool John. - Alright well is the temperature just about right? - Yeah perfect are you going to get in? - Yeah one thing though I'm really upset about you guys, like breaking that swivel head I had, so unfortunately, I'm gonna have to kill you, just like I said. - No, don't, don't, don't. (clicking) - Just a joke. - I hate that. - Well let me get in to now. - I knew you were going to do something like that. - Just a little joke, ah the temperature is good. - That wasn't funny John. - I thought so. - No it was scary, I thought there might be bb's in there. (relaxing music) - Everything is so different he thought, that's the title of a painting that my father made, I always wonder if those, if that's the thoughts in his mind, is his life the way he thought it would be, when he was younger, when he was my age. Did he think he would turn out living in a little room, with his son. Everything is so different he thought, does that run through his mind? I wonder when my parents first got married, and had a kid, did they think that they would be separated and divorced and living two different lives? I'm sure at times thoughts went through their heads, about being together for the rest of their life. I kinda think what my life is going to be like, I wonder if it'll be the same. Everything is so different now. (speaking spanish) - [Leon] Wolves kill only for food, they're dying out, do coyotes also kill only for food? Answer no sir coyotes and feral dogs often kill for fun. And they're multiplying. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Leon I have this idea, what was that, what was that, that one about the cake, the cake, you know the cake, the white house, the white house you know, about the cake? Remember the thing about the cake? No wait Leon, the cakes, the cake, the you know Washington, the cake, relax, the cake. Do you know what I'm talking about? You know in the paper you were reading about the cake, the fact about the cake and the white house. - Yeah, yeah it said, it said it's illegal, to make any pastry in the shape of the white house. - [Morgan] That's it, do you get that idea, I can make that cake and use it as a peaceful way to demonstrate that I don't want anything to do with the draft, I don't want anything to do with that, you know what I mean? It's like a symbol of defiance. Do you understand that? It's illegal but it's so stupid. I'm gonna make a cake Lee, a big cake, and it's gonna be just like the white house. (upbeat music) I'd like to report a crime. I'd like to say that, yeah that's right, that's right. My name is Morgan Walker. What's my address? 1025 21st street, yeah. Number 6532160. I'd like to report that I've made a pastry reproduction, of the white house. (upbeat music)
