Dedicated to all the sleepless nights There's a bee! A bee! A bee! Jeez, shut up. Here, it's dead. All yours. No, stop it! Cut it out. I had set the bar too high for my high school days. Which cost me my precious time I do not have forever. A bigger sin than I had thought. Stuck with uneventful, boring days I could not appreciate. I gradually started losing interest in all things... Or so I thought. Kosaka, we're creating a class chat group. What's your ID? Or number? Huh? Not a chance. Drop dead. You're funny. That's hilarious. No, it's not. Move. Ugh, she's at it again. What a freak. Who's she? She's famous in my year. A total wrist-slasher. Her arm's a mess. Always in long sleeves. A nutcase. Her name or I'll kill you. You'll kill me? You're hilarious. Give me your chatroom ID then. Or your number. Forget it. Just kidding. Shikano. Nana Shikano. Move. Hey, be kind to your fan. I was just being nice, you flunker! Where you going? To bury this bee. Bee? I see. Yeah. Bye. Why are you following me? No reason. Why bury it? You in an entomology group? Why throw the bee in the trash? Huh? I don't like bugs. But more so people who treat them like trash. And... I don't like you either. What? So you don't like anyone but yourself? I hate myself the most. I see, okay. What am I saying? I want to die. You really want to die? Yeah, I do. Then I'll kill you for your sake. You want to die, right? I can kill you. Hearing ridiculous promises like that makes me want to die even more. She piqued my interest. She wants to die yet respects life. She certainly got my attention. He Won't Kill, She Won't Die What? What was that sigh for? How observant. Hey, don't cling on to me. Get off. Why not? I'm so cute that you look even less attractive beside me? I can't stand that mentality. What? - Don't cry. - It's not you. You mean... I might break up. I can't stand it. It's over. I knew it. He won't say he loves me. Unbelievable, right? He did yesterday. That was yesterday. There's no guarantee he loves me today. It's over. Whatever. Get the door. I told him I love him, but he just thanked me. Excuse me. Unbelievable. I'm saying it so he'd reciprocate. Say I love you back, you know? Sure. Even when I say, I hate you. - Not sure about that. - Thanks. I want him to say "I love you" even when I don't. Jimiko, say something. Say that you love me. Tell me you love me. Please! See you, sir. Yachiyo. What? I love you. Okay. I love you more than yesterday. At this rate, I'll love you more tomorrow. You say that, but I'll never love you. That's fine. Rather, that's what I want. I love that you don't love me. You'll find someone better. I won't. How can you be sure? I'm sure someone loves you, so stop being hung up on me. Find your happiness. Why don't you get it? You're the one who I love. I can only think of you. I can't consider others. I'd rather be unhappy with you than be happy with someone else. - I see. - Good. No, don't get your hopes up. I can't go out with you. Huh? Hold on. I never asked you to go out with me. I just told you I love you. I'm fully aware that you don't love me and you won't go out with me. I just wanted to tell you my feelings. All you have to do is to hear me out. So, I love you. You don't get tired saying that? Not at all. But actually... I wish I did. I want to be by your side until it gets old. Not bad. That weirdo... I don't know him yet dissed him. He said he'd kill me. I might get bullied from tomorrow. Give me a break... Hey. Say something. Hey. Yes? Turn around. Do it. You said what you don't like, so tell me what you do like. Chocolate or vanilla? Vanilla. Don't like chocolate? I do. Then why not chocolate? Sure, but... Covered in dirt. Throwing the bee in trash is wrong. Yeah, it's wrong. This bee is me. So I... I... Did you want the vanilla? Yeah. Sorry. Fine, I forgive you. Don't push it. I'll kill you. I'm heading home now. You? You listening? Why are you smiling? Let's go. Hutch the Honeybee Restaurant Miyasada I'm home. - You're late. - Sorry. I wanted my sweet girl's first. But as I suspected since she's so cute, it wasn't her first kiss or first time. But only I know the moment her life left her body. This means I will... Yachiyo, tonight you... Sorry. Sis, it's not like that. Then what are you watching? You know a student got killed? Sure, of course. A senior sent me the killer's footage, so I was watching it. Don't watch such a thing. Okay, I won't. I'm not ready for it. Hey. What did your teacher want earlier? No, just on the status of my club activity. I'll be alone when the seniors retire. - You're in a club? - Yeah. - Which one? - Chess Club. Why didn't you tell me? You never asked. That's true. So what do you want? We've a big group coming tonight. Help out the restaurant. Sure, okay. Hey. Close the door. According to the UN, 25,000 people worldwide die every day due to poverty. Which means one life every three seconds. - Our lives compared to theirs... - 1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3... It may be hard for some of you to picture, but that's no reason to take life lightly. You must cherish all life. Well, that's it, class. Wanna go karaoke? - No. - What do you usually sing? Huh? I don't sing. Then how about bowling? Not a chance. You hungry? Grab a bite? Drop dead. So cold. Drop dead. - Doesn't bowling sound good? - What's good about it? Bowling sounds like fun. - Nothing better to do? - I do. When will you tell me your ID? Not a chance. Why be so cold? That's enough, you pig. Huh? Jerk. I don't want yours. Seriously. Hey, look here. You look so ugly here. Your "I can't take it anymore" look. - Look. - No. - You've never seen it. - Stop. - Look at it. - That's enough! - Look! - I'll die! No, you won't. If you're serious, stop wrist-slashing and just jump. So traumatic. I can't. Told you. - But what'll you do? - Huh? You dare me to, but what if I die? See? See this? You're bleeding. You scared? Come on, see? Look at it. I'll kill you. No, you won't. How annoying. I dare you to kill me. You'll kill me, right? Huh? Why should I dirty my hands for you? If you want to die, do it yourself. Fine. Hey. Hey! Hey... Tell me a funny story. I'll kill you if you say that again. Sorry. I also want people who say that to drop dead. Could you not stare at me? I'm fine. This is embarrassing. That book made you cry? No, I'm just sleepy. I see. You don't cry much. He doesn't know me at all. That's right. I don't cry. Not in public. No, he gets me. I love him! Kiss... No, forget what I just said. I won't do anything, so close your eyes? To kiss me? - Don't want me to? - No. - Too bad. - Not really. An awakening kiss. So that you will wake up. Are you sleep talking? I get it. Good. You prefer our eyes open when... We're not kissing. I had a really good time. Me, too. Thanks, Kyapiko. Sure. Bye. "Bye" sounds like I won't see you again. I don't like it. So say, "See you"? That's cute. - See you. - Yeah, see you. Bye. There you are. You broke up again, Kyapiko? Yeah. I bet you dumped him. I did. Because I didn't want to be dumped. I didn't want to get dumped. Scared he'd lose interest in me. I wanted him to love me forever. I loved him. What a fool. I just... When will you quit this melodrama? No Prince Charming will come for you. But... I got coupons to the creperie you wanted to go to. Get ready in 40 sec. Can I also get ice cream? No, you'll not finish it. Boo... - Come on. - Jimiko... You found me, my Prince Charming. What? I couldn't die again today. It's not you can't die. You won't die. You're not really thinking about dying. Get serious. Stop analyzing me. I'll die. No, you won't. Will you be sad if I did? Will you cry? Who knows? How about you? What if I died? Hm... Come on, stop crying in silence. I'll buy you ice cream. I want a pork bun. This means I will live in her forever. I truly appreciate him for being my guinea pig. Otherwise, everything wouldn't be going so smoothly. Thank you. See? Fine. We shouldn't watch that. Lately he's been growing on me so I saved it. What? Delete it, now. I've been avoiding it so I won't have to watch it. How could you? Don't you think this is a form of love? At least this woman who got killed wasn't lonely. But only I know the moment her life left her body... Nonsense. Delete it now. Forgot the funeral? Our first year? No, I remember. I'm starving. You know that new creperie? - Yeah. - Well... I brought their flyer today. - With the discount coupon? - Yeah. Wanna go? Sure. If you think so, then wake him up! That was awkward. Totally. I remember someone yelling. Yeah. Was she his girlfriend? Who knows? If she was, her boyfriend's love for her was stolen by this guy? Right. I can't stand that. That's unforgivable. I hate this guy. He should die. Deleted it? Yeah. What? Boring. Thought you had a scar or something. Drop dead. Why'd you flunk a year? Because you're stupid? Huh? It's not like that. It's more complicated. Things happened and I... I just got sick of it all. And I had some things I wanted to sort out so... Well, I really needed some time to recharge... You're breaking out of character. I'll kill you. What's this? Doesn't suit you. Huh? Hey! Fool. Hey! Maybe further back? See you around. Keep looking. No, find it. Don't follow me. Don't. Stop it. Yachiyo, what is it? Hey. It's rare that you call me like this. True. So? I... I like you. Please go out with me. Yachiyo... About those scars on your arm. They're from wrist-cutting? Listen, as your teacher, I don't think it's a good thing. You can't run from reality however much you harm yourself. Besides, if you cut too deep, you may really die. You know? If something's bothering you, just tell me. Alright? You hear me? Shikano? Hey, Shikano? Huh? Why did you leave? Quite a runner. Ou... Ouch. What's this? What the... Huh? What's the matter? I want a pork bun. Then we'll go grab one? I'll have a sweet bun. Share one with me. No way. Actually, I want a crepe. Give me a break. Huh? Isn't that Shikano? You're right. Still breathing. Who? From our junior high. Show us. Her arm's sliced up like grilled squid. - She's mental? - Totally. When will you die? Stop, that's bullying. No worries. She won't die. Yeah. What do you really want? Huh? A total whackjob. Um... I'm not sure. Hey, found your twin over there, so I got it. Look at the resemblance. Eat. It's nicely sliced. Look at that, so savage. You a cat? Yummy. A squid? Squid. Last night, I had a very happy dream. Good for you. No, it's not good. I didn't want to have a happy dream. Why not? Because it makes me feel I'm unhappy in real life once I wake up. You've never thought of giving up on reality? I have. When I first confessed my feelings. It was my very first time confessing my love. I thought it was the end of the world. Sorry. Why apologize? You haven't done anything to apologize for. So please don't. You haven't done anything. Well, I have an idea... Do me a favor instead of apologizing. I've a bad feeling. It's something very easy. Could you say "I love you" for just once? What for? Is it okay to say "I love you" when I don't mean it? - Maybe not. - Right? Then... How much do you love me? Maybe this much. So you do like me. I see your strategy. You're quite a schemer. You know, I... Yeah? I had a scary dream. Like what? It was about you leaving me. When I say that... Kyapiko, come here. They'd hold me tight. It works every time. Truth is, I hadn't had a dream. I'm right here. Yeah. You're so petite. Am I? Yeah. The smallest I've ever had. What the hell. - Really? - Yeah. Compared to who? I'm glad. Just look at me. Why does Kyapiko flirt even with those whom she doesn't really like? Because I want to be loved. Jimiko, we were born to be loved. But that's... Jimiko, I want to live. Okay? What will happen to her when no one loves her? What will happen to her the moment she is loved like never before? I'm afraid that she might die. Huh? Hey, you were here. Sorry. The door locked as I was opening it. Did I scare you? It's fine. I'm glad you're here. Were you asleep? I was composing. I see. Thanks. What'll happen if I told him that I love him? Hey, what if I told you that I love you? What's the matter? Nothing. If I told you that I love you, what'll you do? What's wrong? Nothing. It's nothing. I need more. It's not enough at all. What's not enough? What do you want? Everything. Give me everything. Keep your dirty paws off my boyfriend Who's this? Rot in hell If I ask, "Do you like me?", I'm afraid you'd say, "I don't," so I can't ask. So I take comfort in asking the opposite and you saying, "I don't dislike you." I see. You dislike me? Whatever. That means you don't dislike me, right? If so, you'll forgive me. Take this. Please don't dislike me. I'll kill you. I dare you. Alright, I win! Time out for a sec. Where to? Taking a dump? To cut my wrist. Be right back. If it's so routine for you, just cut off your wrist. - Shut up. I'll die. - Go ahead. Pick it up. Now. Please. I'll name you in my suicide note. No, I don't want trouble. Just die. If I were a princess, I wouldn't be treated like this. Let me win once in a while. Only beauties can be princesses. You stand no chance. I'm the world's fairest, but turned ugly by a jealous wicked witch. A kiss will turn me back. Then you want me to kiss you? Become a beauty or die. What? Kiss me? You're serious? What's that look? Just drink this. From the same straw? You perv. Stop it. Stop staring. I came to see you. Why? You need a reason to see the one you love? I think it's highly necessary when it's unrequited. How about because I missed you? Will that be a good reason to come see you? Tell me. I don't quite get love. You say you love me so easily, but what does that mean? Aren't you just playing me? You listening? Huh? Sorry, wasn't listening. Just thinking how much I love you. I told you, I don't get the feeling to love. I know. I'll teach you. Is love something to be taught? Don't know about that, but I found love when I met you. Right, there was a reason why I came to see you. Ta-da! I have tickets to the movie you wanted to see. You want to go? Sure. Then let's exchange numbers? Sure, okay. What? You sure? It's personal info. You'll abuse it? What? No way, I would never. Why didn't you ask until now? What are you looking for? My friend's birthday is coming up. Not sure what to get. For a boy? What should I get? Or a girl? A girl. College friend. How about this? Isn't it cute? Not sure. Hey, you keeping a secret from me? A secret? No, I'm not. Liar. I see. I see. Why? Listen. Do me a favor. Will you? Like what? Break up with your girlfriend. Okay? I can't tell him that. Listen. What? Let's break up. I can't tell him that either. Listen. What? Hold me tight? Hey. Not in public, okay? Sorry. Sato. Kodaira. Kosaka. Kinjo. Kawasaki. Kawase. Katayama. Okumura. Hey, what did you score? You? 98. The two points annoy me. Anyway, I'm staying over at yours. I see, a score too low to go home. Good, nice play! Gloating because you scored high on the test? Shut it. I'm working today. Go home first. But I'm crashing at yours. Help yourself in. You work part-time? Yeah. Why? For money. Because of you. Huh? Which do you value more? Your phone or me? My phone. I see. Can't help it then. Sorry. That's right. Atta girl. My phone is important, you hear me? I'm saving up. What for? College. I flunked, so I don't want to burden my mom anymore. I probably need to get a scholarship, but a little savings could be useful. I want to get tutoring too. Huh? What now? Don't leave me. Don't leave me behind. How unstable are you? What'll you do? Seriously? Definitely not cool. I'm home. Hey. Where's Shikano? Nana? Yeah. She's not here. I see. Dooms Day Park Come on, pick up. Thanks for coming. Not dead, are you? Huh? You a fool? Can't you see? I'm walking. Listen, don't just text a location. And pick up your phone. My phone died. Watch where you're pointing. Maybe too damp? No good. It won't work. They're my treasured fireworks. Since when? Fifth grade. Huh? That's way too old. Creepy. Let's go. So disappointed. Let's do fireworks in the summer. Promise? Don't forget. I'll die if you do. Shut up. I'll kill you. What now? Sorry. For running off. Want some pork buns? I want ice cream. Vanilla? Yup. Alright. Sorry, didn't mean to call you. Liar. Incoming call - Yachiyo Huh? Yes, hello? Sorry I didn't notice your call. Not at all. Sorry I called you out of the blue. You called about the movie? Huh? Yeah, that's right. Where should we meet? Hold on, give me a sec? What? How do I record on this? Hanging up. Sorry. The first time, I thought she was joking. Listen, Yachiyo. Yeah? I... I love you. Is this a joke? The second time. Yachiyo, I love you. I thought she was weird. The third time. What? Yachiyo, I love you. I thought she'd get tired of it. The fourth time. Yachiyo, I love you. The fifth time. Yachiyo, I love you. - Yachiyo. - The sixth time. I love you. The seventh time. Yachiyo, I love you. - Yachiyo. - The eighth time. I love you. - Yachiyo. - The ninth time. I love you. The tenth time. Yachiyo, I love you. Yachiyo. Since when was it? I really love you. For some time now I... I'm not in love with you. I don't remember since when, but I've been waiting for her. What should I do? I got too excited I didn't get any sleep. Nadeshiko, you're early. Huh? You, too. Well, yeah. I arrived earlier than planned. Hey, you look cute today. Huh? No, well I... We're early, but let's go in? Sure. Brought your ticket? My voice is echoing. - Right? - Ah... You're right. Give me your ticket. Here. Where should we sit? Hm... - Here. - Thank you. Toward the front? Ah... Sure. In Theater 4. This is us. Yeah. Not sitting? Right. I can't wait. Me, too. So close. What if my stomach starts growling? He even looks good from the side. Looking all serious. The movie was amazing. Thank you, Nadeshiko. Well, I was too distracted by you I couldn't focus on the movie, so I'll rewatch it on DVD. I see. Let me do something in return. Any requests? You okay? Ikkun! Ikkun! Mommy! I told you not to run. Sorry about my son. Sacchan? Sacchan? Could you be Yakkun? Yakkun?! Wow, you've grown. How've you been? Yakkun... You haven't changed at all. Look at you, such a cute girlfriend. Not a girlfriend yet. "Yet"? I'm headed to my parent's place. It's been so long. I see. Sorry to disrupt your date. Ikkun, say bye. Bye. Bye. - See you around. - Sure. Yachiyo didn't deny it's a date. - Sacchan! - Yeah? I wish you happiness. I am happy. Yachiyo, you asked me for any request earlier. Yeah. My hand... I want you to hold my hand for 10 sec. Yachiyo walked me home. He held my hand for more than 10 sec. Let's... stop seeing each other. There's a girl who cries over me fooling around, so... I know. I knew about it. You'll dump me and run back to her? Why? I'm definitely cuter. Come on, I'm better. Besides, I... Besides, I love you more than her. Just go home. You said I'm cute. You are cute. But that's it. What else do you want? What else do you need than me being cute? I see. Thanks till now. Bye. Over there. It's a nice house. A farm house. I see, that's nice. Nah... See you. Okay. I had fun today. I now know for sure I love you. Would you... Yeah? What? No, it's nothing. Hey, it's not fair to stop halfway. Tell me what you're thinking. I'd accept anything you say. Would you still love me if I told you I love you? I don't get what you mean. Don't you love me because I won't love you? I knew it. But I... I like you. I wanted to grow up fast. So that I could... You're only a kid. You won't get it. Sacchan was already pregnant at the time. She must have gone through hell. But I knew nothing. I was only a kid. I don't want anyone else to hate me. Especially not you. But I wanted you to hear my story. You're a fool. Now I know age doesn't matter. Listen, Yachiyo. Let's talk about the future. Future? Let's invite Sacchan and Ikkun to a picnic in the park. I'll pack us lunch. It'll be fun. You're right. A future I would've never imagined without you. Tomorrow is a future. Even this moment onward. It has already started. The path to the future. Right. Don't worry. It's okay now. Sacchan was smiling like she was really happy. I'm sure we can be happy, too. Let's be. Slowly but surely. Yeah. Yachiyo, I love you. Thanks, Nadeshiko. I love you, too. If he was gonna lie, I wish he did all the way. Then I could have smiled adorably next to him, acting all oblivious. Will you stop being such a drama queen at my place? There's a girl who cries when he sees me. So he won't see me anymore. I knew about her, but... Why did he think that girl was the only one who'd cry over him? Don't cry, Kyapiko. Jimiko, tell me when you find your love. Huh? No way. Why not? Because I... I'm not cute like you. But... what's that have to do with me being cute? Class! Who wants to be Cinderella? - Not the boys. - Why not? Kyapiko, I think you should be Cinderella. Why? Because you're the cutest. Do I look cute? Yeah, you look cute. I see, I'm a princess because I'm cute. Mommy listen, I was told I'm cute. That's why I'm going to play a princess. I see, good for you. Not at all. Listen, mommy's going out for a while. Be a good girl. Not until mommy tells me I'm cute. You can play alone, right? Right? I'm going. Mommy wasn't the type who could play alone. You're really okay on your own, right? Bye. Mommy, wait. Mommy, don't go. I could stand being alone, but not the loneliness. Told you not to go all drama queen here. Cute. Hey Kyapiko, Jimiko was dissing you in the classroom just now. What? Really? She doesn't want to hang with you. - Right? - Right. - Isn't that awful? - Right. What's that? Ridiculous. I better check with Jimiko. - Hey, wait. - Kyapiko, wait. Kyapiko. Isn't this bad? - What now? - What'll we do? Well, who cares. Jimiko, painful to be with Kyapiko? Kyapiko said you're a foil to her. But she's not that cute. So true. And her name. Such a flashy name. So over the top. I see. I get it. She's full of herself. But not cute. - Not at all. - Totally. Shut up. Shut it. Rats. Huh? What? That's you, four-eyes. She's cute. Kyapiko's cute. We're saying it out of kindness. Kyapiko's using you. Huh? Kyapiko. I was waiting for you. Let's go. Okay. You know, I love myself. I'm cute, so cute, really cute. Isn't it sad saying it yourself? But who else would tell me that? I have to say it myself. Right? Huh? I've always told you. To be honest, I have many things I don't like about myself. Don't worry. You're cute. But all girls are cute. From afar. Huh? You're cute even up close, so you're good. I see. Let's go get the new Frappuccino. Sure. Hurry. Watch your step. Don't run, it's dangerous. You'll fall. See? I told you. You okay? Ou... Here. You're actually quite tough. And like Cinderella on the stairs. Indoor shoe, though. Will you be mad if I said you're like a prince? That's messed up. Come on, let's go. Okay. The flavor Yachiyo likes. $1.5, please. This song. The artist Yachiyo likes. If Yachiyo was in front of me right this moment, what would I tell him? How I considered and decided not to get bangs? The egg I cooked had twin yolks? I bet he'd smile softly after saying, "Whatever." I can't wait to tell him. I can't wait to see Yachiyo. Hey. I love you. I know. The world won't change a bit even if I died. Obviously. The world may not change, but if you die I will change a little. Most likely. Just a little. A little. It's me you're talking about. That's quite something. You frog face. Who do you think you are? Anyway, I'll change if you die. Then don't change while I'm still alive. Don't tell me what to do. Just die. Be nice. I was devastated when I learned I can't ride the clouds. Have you ever lost all faith? Not in everything. Just in myself when I hurt my leg. In yourself? Yeah. I... I wanted to become a soccer player. You asleep? What an ugly sleeping face. Get up now and I'll kill you. Hey... You know, you notice something today? Notice what? What is it? Don't ask me what. My hairstyle. It's styled differently today. Don't make me say it. What's with you today? Like the world's neediest baby. Shut up. I'll kill you. See? Later. Hey. Yeah? Well, you know, are you thinking about college? I don't know. No plans at all. I do have a plan. Die, you fool. Be nice. To be by your side. Let's go to the same college. Can't. I'm stupid. Well... Maybe you are now, but who knows tomorrow. Let's talk about the future. Okay? Okay. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Hey, will you always lead the way for me? And turn back from time to time? I want to see what you see. By your side. Hey, hello there. Who are you? Nah, I'm just a nobody. Just tell me. Mind a few questions? I'm in a hurry. Try someone else. Too bad. Then maybe I'll go to the house of the girl you were just with. Huh? What do you want? Are you in love? Love? Who are you? Who popped into your head? That girl? You are in love. What's this? You want me to kill you? Me? Killed by you? No way. Freak. You're gonna die. I'm killing you. I'm a careful, meticulous type. I always think practice makes perfect. But it's lame to say, "It didn't matter who," right? So I decided to practice on someone who is in love. Finally I can kill the girl I love. Awesome. It worked out so well. Ouch... What's with that psycho? Damn, die you psycho. Well, I'm the one dying... Mom said she's cooking fried chicken today. Tomorrow's English class, I'll get called on. And her... Will she cry? I love you. I really love you so much. Don't cry. Smile... Shikano, you must live. Incoming call - Kosaka's mom Yes, hello? Yes. What? Died? Who did? What? He died. Everyone was crying, saying, ""He was still so young." When my mom died in her 50s, people also said, "She was still so young." That made no sense. I didn't shed a tear at his funeral. "He seems like he's just asleep." Many people said that as they looked at his face. I just couldn't stand that. Wake him up. If you think so, then wake him up! That was awkward. Totally. I just wanted to see him again. He came to see me that night. Hey. I see, it's a dream. That's right. This is your dream. Make yourself at home. Huh? Well, sure. Yeah. The guy who killed you. People are talking about him. Covered on TV news too. Said the reason why he killed you was because you were in love. You... You were in love with me? Shut up. You said, "See you tomorrow." Liar. I know. You said you'd kill me, but you died. I'm bummed. Also said we'd do fireworks. A total disappointment. Unacceptable. I... I don't want to make you a memory. As my days go on, I may forget about you. I'm scared. I don't want that. Don't want this. Don't want that. But I... I don't. I don't like that you're dead. I know. Hey, can I see you again if I die? No. Unfortunately, suicide and murder victims go to different places. So I can't see you anymore? Yeah, this is it. Then... I'll sleep forever. I can see you again in my dreams? Huh? You must get up, eat, and go to school. Even without you? Yeah, even without me. I don't want to live in a world without you. Listen, I had something to give you, but I thought I still had time. Huh? What is it? In my... desk... second drawer from the top. Remember it even after you wake up. I will. So ugly. Okay then, let's kiss goodbye. Huh? What? Okay. Close your eyes. Close them. You can open your eyes now. Waking up with a kiss. Just like a princess. As he told me in my dream, I ate and went to school. Hey, Shikano. Notes from the days you missed. If you'd like. Thank you. And... I went to his place. Coming. Nana. Hey... My bad, just a habit. I still can't believe it. I just reacted seeing your face. My bad. Her uneasy smile reminded me so much of him. Sorry. Thanks for coming. You really are... He may have objected, but this is the only photo where he's smiling. Soccer... He was really good at it. You really don't look good with a ribbon. Want to see his room? I haven't touched it. Nothing has changed. Smells like him. "To Shikano" "Troll" "Frog face" It's addressed to me, but also calling me names. What's with him? So creepy. Happy birthday Had nothing to write really Come on, write more. I forgot... On the day of his funeral, I had turned 18. What's this? So ugly. Hugging his clothes and indulging in his smell, I thought I could almost feel him. I had another dream that night. You came again? You called me. That's how it works? That's how it works. Thanks for your note. But write more. Yeah. Truth is... I thought I could tell you more myself. Sorry. In the coming years, you will go to many new places and meet many new people. If you forget about me, that's only natural, nothing bad. What're you saying? I lied. Think about me once in a while. You stupid? No way I'd forget about you. Yeah, thanks. Will you keep watch? Watch over me? Till my day comes? Yeah. I will. Always watch over you. Till your time comes. This is my dream, so maybe all his words are my fabrication so that he'd say what I want to hear. Thanks. But that's fine. Even if it was a dream, it saved me. So warm. Yeah. Thanks. Goodbye. I love you. I love you so much. Spring came and I started college. Without him. He's no longer here. What's the matter? Don't suddenly scream like that. I almost... Ouch... Hey, you want ice cream? Huh? Chocolate or vanilla. Which do you like? I don't like either. I see. Yachiyo is... Right, his name is Yachiyo. He's short and cute, but with a cool voice. At the entrance exam, he sat next to me. I forgot my eraser, so he lent me his. I used the corner of his eraser, but he didn't get upset with me. I totally fell in love, so asked a boy out for the first time. But he turned me down. I was so shocked that I got rejected. But then I started thinking he's great for not falling for someone like me. But rejection really hurt me and I just lost it. When I realized, I had a razor... These here? They've faded quite a lot. But still like grilled squid on skewer. Sorry. He was there. He was watching over me. Huh? What's wrong? Oh, I'm so sorry. There was a bee. Listen, let's talk about the future. Thank you so much. I'll do my best. Good. Bye. Are you watching over me? Please. Keep watching over me.
