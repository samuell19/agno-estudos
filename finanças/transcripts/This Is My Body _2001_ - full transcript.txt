Subt?tulos ripeados por Leonnos avenidalibertad ? apolocinegay THIS IS MY BODY Horizon Films I'll pass on the message. By fax would be fine. How about Wednesday at five-thirty? You're welcome, bye. Hi, I'd like to see Roland Jouve. Horizon Films. Sorry, she's in a meeting. Can you call back later? Thank you, bye. Expecting you? - He said to drop by. - Today? I doubt it. We met in the street yesterday, he spoke of a film... Then do like everyone, letter, photo, CV. But he said I was perfect. Then a letter is best. So all real symmetric matrices are orthonormally diagonalizable. Or for all endomorphisms of a Euclidean space E of dimension K one orthonormal base of E exists on which the matrix of U is diagonal. Perfect, Vinteuil. Any questions? She really gives me hell. You say that every day. But she's overdoing it. - Eh, Ida? We're not robots! - Where's my water? I can't make it tonight. She was wrong. My poise was perfect. - Just picking holes. - Like always. You listening? It's my Gran's birthday tonight. So, what of it? Eating with us tonight, Antoine? - Lay off, Jean-Michel! - Hey, cool it. Wasn't talking to you. What's with you? It doesn't matter! Stop feeling guilty, it gets to me. We'll meet tomorrow. It's better that way. - Why's that? - Because I'm strung out... Okay! - I'm gonna go eat with them. - Drop you off? What? It's a block away! Sorry... I'm out of line right now, ratty with everyone... After I sob, then I bawl my eyes out... You're feeling down, it'll pass. Why that look? You know sometimes you talk like it wasn't you. I wonder why we're together. Well, for once, you're speaking your mind. See you tomorrow! That's cheating! Wait till you're her age. - Get the champagne. - Wait, we've a show. Is it long? That's not nice. Charlotte and me are on the boat from Brazil... Remember you were lost on deck, looking for your dad? But you told me yourself! Don't worry, she'll recall. - She doesn't remember? - Gran's forgetful, it doesn't matter. I'm fed up waiting! Yes, it does! There's no point if she forgets! Come on! She'll like it. No she won't! That's silly! Where's Pierre? Antoine, the champagne. - Why didn't he come? - 'Cos he's dead! - Be polite to Gran! - She's nuts! Valentine and Charlotte, come here! Gran, Pierre died over a year ago. You know that. Last Saturday, we went to the cemetery, remember? We planted heather. Don't try to muddle me. I'm not yet gaga. I saw my grandson. When was it now? Yesterday morning! Yes, yesterday morning. We strolled in the park. So handsome... It was wonderful. You never loved... that child. That's what he told me. Never loved him. Mother, please. Antoine! What's keeping you? She does it on purpose. You hypocrite! Just like your mother. Don't look so surprised, I know you hate me. So you can stuff your Christian Charity! Well, I'm through. Don't leave, darling, it's your birthday! Gabriel, top me up. Going to serve me, or what! Bloody hell! Gabriel... These lies will have to stop. Otherwise... you'll drive me crazy. Call Pierre. Tell him to come home... that you forgive him. It's for you! Your beloved Clara! Clarinet! Trumpet! - Bugger off! Where's the phone? - Dad has it. Clarinet! Trumpet! Roland Jouve... Know him? Tell him we're eating. Speaking... It's just, I've nothing to write with. No bother, I'll go to my room. Who is it? I don't know, some ill-bred lout! Stop it! Go get your mother for the champagne. Valentine's right, you should go and get her. You've vexed her. You treat the poor dear so badly. She doesn't deserve it. Mother, finish your cake, its time for bed. Stop it! Go to the movies? Yeah, pretty regular. And I record stuff on TV. But I don't have much time. - What do you do? - I'm in business school. So, it's no go. A pity, you fitted the bill. We had a guy but he left. We're in deep shit. No problem for me, I want to quit college. - How old are you? - Nearly 20. So what'd your folks say to movie-making? That's my business. You're right. Family can be a drag. So, what kind of film is it? Louise? Can you come here a sec? I'm with that boy I mentioned. One more day with that guy, and I quit! The scene on the barge? He wants it in a caf?! Honestly! Sit down. I swear, I can't work like that. I'll go crazy! Louise Vernet, Antoine Vinteuil. - Hello. - What do you reckon? Look at me. Did you screen test him? Free on Monday? - I'll manage. - Fine. Shit! Sorry. Doesn't matter, it was good. No, it wasn't. Mind you, I did last 5 minutes. Progress. Can't make love to a stopwatch. You're spoiling your own pleasure, you're so uptight. You're bathed in sweat. Can't be much fun for you. - What're we eating? - I got Chinese. Know what I'd like? That you invite me over. Oh yeah? Sure, am I a leper? Just like to meet your folks. I'm sure we'd get along. No? I dunno. On the night he was betrayed, he took the bread, he blessed it and giving You thanks, he gave it to his disciples and said: "Take this all of you and eat it, "this is my body, which will be given up for you." I want some. Then, when supper was ended he took the cup, he gave You thanks and blessed it. He gave it to his disciples and said: "Take this all of you and drink from it, this is my blood "the blood of the new and everlasting covenant "it will be shed for you and for all "so that sins may be forgiven. "Do this in memory of me." We've decided to clear it out, so you can have a study. Somewhere quiet to work. Best give the clothes to the Red Cross. It'd be a shame to junk the books, but... they need sorting. I mean... if you feel up to it. Open the shutters. Should've done it after the funeral, it was my fault. Your mom didn't want... I don't need a study. We'll repaint it. Do it for your Mom. She never mentions it, that's the worst of all. Shall we go down? I think lunch is ready. Antoine, I don't want a repetition with you. Why do you say that? We don't talk a lot, but l trust you. I've faith in you. Likewise. When I bought my company I'd a staff of 32. Now there are over 2000. I'm still hiring. One day, it'll be yours. To this demand corresponds a burning desire, to free man from his sensory bonds and to direct his gaze heavenward. As if, neglectful of the Divine, man, worm-like, was to content himself with earth and water. This is what Hegel says, and it's absolutely wonderful. Could you describe your attacker? Dark hair, late teens, regular features... - Kind of... - Kind of what? Not really a thug. Wore a leather jacket, but upmarket. Okay, that'll do. - No problems of memory. - No, but as for the rest... Don't worry I was just getting your expressions, your voice. By the way, if you're interested, I haven't told my folks so I'll call you, if that's okay. What do you mean "bogged down"? - I want a break. - Well, now's not the time. It never is with you. Why do you say that? We've always trusted you. - Eat up. - Not hungry. You need to get organised. You're too last minute. - It's not bad organisation. - Then what is it? I don't understand you. If you manage to get into an elite business school, you're home and dry. Hey I'm talking to you! - Your very words. - I've changed my mind. It's now or never. And with all discretion, your Clara... She may be very nice, I don't know her... I feel she's no help. - You're too different. - Difference is bad? Too much can be. You just don't get it. Get what? It's like talking to a brick wall! Take a week off, get a change of air! One guy held me down like he was gonna strangle me. The other's engine wouldn't start, and the guy drew a knife, stuck it under my chin saying if I didn't cough up he'd bleed me like a pig. "Like a pig", he said. Could you describe your attacker? Dark hair, late teens, regular features... - Kind of... - Kind of what? Not really a thug. Wore a leather jacket, but... Come in, how are you? - Find it alright? - I had a map. Where do you live? Val d'Or, near Saint-Cloud. Know it? Think I messed up your home life. Doesn't matter. I forget that most people sleep at night. I'd like to, but I can't. Been three... four years now. Something jammed in my head. Like a drink? I've got whisky, Coke, both... Coke is fine. - Nice place. - Not mine. Help yourself. Weird seeing myself like that. - What do you think? - Not for me to say. Well, the camera likes you, that's the main thing. Roland said you'd found an actor, but he let you down, is it true? I saw over 50, but I knew he was the one. Like love at first sight. So? Why did he leave? Got scared at the last minute. Of you? No, I don't think so. So, do I look like him? Not at all. Here, look. Roland found him. He was barman in a club. What I liked about him... was his smile. See? He looked sixteen, with the face of an angel. The tests were perfect, a real natural. And when it came to sign the contract it all fell apart. He didn't show. I think he'd major personal problems. Lucas Ferrand... Yes... Lucas Ferrand. Jumped from a fifth floor window, no one knows why. At first, we were totally wiped out. But what can you say... Now I have to think of my film. So if you agree, the role is yours. But careful, think it over well. Roland tells me you're studying. Don't go messing up your future for a 9-week shoot. But if you say yes, there's no backing out, okay? Can I read the screenplay? I'm rewriting, and with you it'll change again. I'm always shifting things around. Can't I know what it's about? Tell you tomorrow, don't feel like it now. But I can't say yes, blind. I don't know you, or your films. I know nothing about you. Nor did Lucas, and he said yes on the spot. I'm Antoine, not Lucas. You're right... I'll show you out. Well, that's that. Thanks for your frankness, sorry I can't help. Wait, stay a while... No, I'd rather go home. Seven o'clock, out of bed! - I'm not going. - You are, now up! - I got to bed late. - I know, 3:20 a.m. - How do you know? - Neither your mom nor I slept a wink! So why should you sleep in when I've to go to work? - Why did that woman call? - That's my business. In theory, that's true, but this is different. - Why is it different? - Don't shout! Your mom said you want a break. I don't know what you're hatching, but forget it. You finish your year, pass your exams, and then you can rest! Fuck! - I agree. - Good. Where is she? Home, but not answering. She's ill. Really? This is Fr?d?ric, the guy with the knife. If it doesn't change again. Hi. - Sure I can't call her? - No, when she's ill, best not to. But don't worry, I'll tell her. Two whisky and Cokes. Meet Antoine, he's replacing Lucas. All going well. I'm glad we get along. On a movie it's better that way. Mind you, Louise thinks mutual hate gets better results. But then, she is a bit odd. How about a line? Let's go to the can. No, not for me. Fuck, don't look so down! I'd to sweat to get this role. And you just walk into Lucas' shoes! Lucas meant a lot to her. Believe me, hang in there and she's yours. She likes to feel wanted. But me, no thanks. Going to the can. How much do I owe? - That's okay. - Thanks. - You knew Lucas well? - A good buddy. Too bad. He had problems? Have a seat. - Can I have a whisky? - Go ahead. - What's in the boxes? - My stuff... So? Well... I've been thinking. Tell me a little about it and I'm in. I really want to... have this experience. It really matters to me. I can't stand my studies, the people... the whole thing. Let me tell you straight. The more I observe you, the more I doubt. I liked what I saw on the tests, but now... I'm not sure... I don't know why. I guess it must be me, but that's how I am. If I'm not totally convinced, I get nowhere. Maybe I can't forget the presence of Lucas... Maybe I shouldn't make this film now, but later, when I've digested all that. I guess I can't force you. That, you can't. So what's my part? All I know is, he gets mugged. Yes, that's just one scene. I don't want to talk script. Quit drinking! You'll get silly if you can't handle it. Don't worry, I can. What happens next? Next? I'm tired, Antoine. Please leave. I need your help. What does that mean? Dunno... I felt I could talk to you. You've a girlfriend for that. Yeah, but with Clara it's tricky... We all have our little woes and helping others is not my thing, especially not right now. So up, I want to sleep. - I swear, I really want this film. - Get a grip. What you really want is a listener, and it's not me. Come on... What's up? Nothing. - What'd she say? - He jumped. Sure... I don't get it. - Was she in love with him? - Madly. You know, Lucas was kind of fragile. Real nice, but fragile. And not into women. I reckon that's what turned her on. He was different. But she didn't just do him good. Nice of you to come. Didn't hear. Tell me again. Again. It's not easy to love you. You know that? You tell me nothing. I never know where you are, what you do. But with you, I'm happy. Why do you say that? Sometimes, I guess... I'm afraid of losing you. I wanted to see you again, apart from at home. If you can call that home. What'd you do today? Went to class, as usual. And you'd be willing to give it all up... overnight? Yeah, like I said. That's what I don't get. You're unhappy at home? Better decide what you want. Last time, drunk, I wanted to talk. But you said no. You threw me out. Now you want me to tell you my life. It doesn't figure. You good in maths? Yeah, why? Just wondering. Here, I brought you the screenplay. A lot of stuff will probably change, but read it and call me. What the hell are you playing at? What do you mean? You know damn well, you've been skipping class! You come home every night at all hours! Want to fail your exams, do another year? More to life than exams. Not now there isn't. So tell your Clara, or I'll tell her for you! It's Antoine. Did I wake you? Oh, good. So, I read it... It's great. Antoine, meet Olivia, your fianc?e. The flannel is too dark. Try the jeans. - Seen Thierry? - Who's that? Production director, he has your contracts. And better find you a name, Antoine Vinteuil sounds phoney. You think it sounds phoney? No, I quite like it. Right, now for the shoes. Made up your mind? I'm going, they're waiting. - You're off your head. - Yeah, sure... We meet nearly every day. I wasn't sure, talking about it was pointless. Yeah, like me, pointless. What do I mean to you? I really wonder. - Didn't even tell your folks. - Who cares! You've no respect. I've drowned in it since I was a kid! I'm no mass-goer, but I respect those I love. I'm going. It's not your thing, it's obvious! Wise up! - Louise doesn't agree. - It's a profession! I've signed, I can't back out. I'm with Louise Vernet... Kept us waiting. She'd a rehearsal. No, he's a born liar. - We'd a big row. - Can it! Why should I? Tonight I'm telling the truth. The whole truth. And I'm thirsty. Have a seat. What'll you have? Vodka! Well, I'll be leaving you... Clubs aren't my thing. Tomorrow, at ten? For a read-through. Don't wear him out. She's really nice. - No, it's the truth, I swear. - Please... Well... I'll go get your vodka. And a whisky. What does he do? He's the guy I fall in love with. A gay movie? - She looks the type. - What? Who's into gays. I know the score... What score? Nothing. Gotta pee. If any girl chats you up, say you're taken. Hi, Antoine! Meet Miouchka. - Nouchka. - Right... She's Ukrainian. From Kiev, right? Useless in geography. One of 15 federated republics of the ex USSR. Bordering Byelorussia and Poland... Who cares! Check out the chick. Works for Armani, great in bed, if you're on... I've another. Champagne all round? Come here often? Do you come here often? Lost your mind? Don't think so. Years of study for this? I thought you'd more sense, I was mistaken. My son is a swinger. It's hard to swallow. Just before your exams... What'd she do, bewitch you? Not at all. It's an experience. Do it during vacation, as work-study training. Starts next month. It's a nine-week shoot. And have you considered your mother? This will kill her a second time. Keep your blackmail. Go speak to Father Monestier, he likes you... always good advice. Dad, I've lost the faith. You'd better get used to that too. I'm tired of pretending. Well, so am I. You little bastard. Go join her! I'm sure that's all she wants! But don't count on us. Want to go it alone? Then take it all the way! Not another penny! I already signed my contract. Out! You're on your own. That's the end of it! We'll get by without you. Little bastard. What're you doing? Waxing. Can't you see? That's the painters' job. Yes, but I felt like doing it myself... It relaxes me. Smells awful! But the floor's nice, no? What's all this, Antoine? Mind my cloth, it'll be all over you! You, here? What time is it? Dunno... Four a.m. I gotta talk to you. Can't it wait? I took a sleeping pill. It's important. Can you put me up a while? Had a row with Clara? With Clara... With my father too. And? It's no good. Sort it out, I've my own problems. Don't worry, I'm of age. You split from home? Yes. So why not go to your girlfriend's? That's all she wants. Clara's dying for us to live together. I don't want to. I can't keep you here. Just a few days, until I find a solution. A month ago... at about the same time, Lucas showed up here. He'd had a row with his boyfriend, coked out of his mind. So I stuck him under the shower... And then, I lost it. Only I'm not Lucas. You don't understand. That kid flung himself into my arms, and I, thinking I could help him, also desired him... And laughing, he said... it was the first time he'd had a hard on for a woman. After... he moved in here for two days. For two days we didn't open the blinds. His Jo?l did everything to get him back. Go find a hotel. At this hour? I don't know any hotels. And I haven't got a thing. Not even a toothbrush! And no petrol. You're on your own! That's what my dad said. Just one night. I'm exhausted. Damn you, Antoine. Bed down there. There are sheets, but slept in. - Good night. - Yeah, good night. Can you get me some cigarettes? You can take my car. You're home late. Sorry, I couldn't call. Doesn't matter. Hell, they check up on everything. The number of shots. The sets, the costumes... I can't work like that. Everything costed to the last penny. - Gotta go. - Where? - Got a meeting. - Clara? See her tomorrow, don't leave me alone. Won't be long. Come in. Just what did you want to know? Well, it's a bit complicated... Lucas and I often spoke... Never mentioned you. But that's not surprising. When I heard... Slept together? Once, yes. You want to know why he killed himself. Was he ill? No, that's just it, he was perfectly healthy. But one's reasons for jumping out a window are often obscure. Mind if I smoke? Yes, I do. Listen, if I agreed to see you it's because I too had hoped... let's say... to understand. No note, nothing. He'd slept here only the night before. He was to play the lead in a film. Yes, that really got to him. Yes, he was very scared of some woman... Louise Vernet, you know her? Vaguely. She's a monster. How did you meet Lucas? In a club. He was whoring to get by and we met regularly. While I paid, I was protected. Money saved me from any sentimental attachment. And then one day, he trapped me. He told me he needed me, that money wasn't the issue. I dived straight in. We thought to make love in all innocence. No such thing. You regret it? Regrets belong on tombstones. If you don't mind, it's late. I'll see you out. We've no reason to meet again. None... Thank you, sir. Thanks for seeing me. "So you're Lucas?" "Yes, that's me..." It bugs me. Why call me Lucas? It's like you did it on purpose! What was wrong with Thomas? Can we go on? Knowing the story, it gets to me. In that case, we'll call you Thomas. "You're Thomas?" "Yes, that's me." "Imagined you otherwise." "Well, I remember you, and your knife." "So what exactly do you want?" Your mom needs you. Hi, Clara... Your dad's in the hospital. What's up? She didn't say. Is it serious? He slept at your place? With you? Darling... Let's not get familiar. Go, hurry... Wait for me! I'd rather go alone. I'm ashamed over Fr?d?ric. Enjoyed yourself? Good. I was drunk. He kissed me. So you touched him up! - I'm coming too. - I'm going alone. You fool, to hell with Fr?d?ric! It's you I love! - A good lay? - Stop it. - Let me come. - Out, or I'll get mad. What's got into you? Is it Louise? Out, I said. It's plain she loves you... You jerk! He took a turn at the office, they called emergency. What do the doctors say? A mild heart attack... They may have to operate. - Can I see him? - No. Why not? He's being examined! And after what happened... - Where are you going? - To smoke. - You smoke? - Not me, my character. What nonsense. He's got a big hole in his knickers! Stop, you're being silly. Fabien came to school with a hole in his knickers. - Even saw his willy! - Liar! Can't change the subject? How about a song? On Monday morning, the emperor and his band came to my home to shake me by the hand, but since I was out the little prince did say we'll have to come back again on Tuesday... - Wednesday! - Not Thursday? We were Tuesday. Okay... You hadn't signed? I trusted her. From the start, she said I'd do Dino. And now she tells me she has to use another guy. He's got a name, it reassures the TV networks. Olivier Mondor, know him? Got a C?sar last year. A slimebag. Doesn't even fit the role. What a bitch! Next time, I'll break her face! And I didn't even react. I was too sickened. It's disgusting. I'm out of welfare, and no projects on the horizon. Up shit creek. - Well, I'll be going. - Where to? Dunno... Maybe burn something highway, to unwind. You couldn't lend me some cash? Tank's almost empty. Thanks. Did Lucas ever mention a Jo?l? Jo?l Vannier? The publisher? Yeah, his sideline. What'd he say? You know, Lucas was... a whore in angel's disguise. I reckon he got his. - Why do you ask? - Just wondering. Laurent, same again. Stop Antoine. Any more and you'll be out. You really knew Lucas? Drop it. - Did you fuck? - Hey... be nice and go home. Can I come in? You're drunk. You okay? You woke me. I've to be up at six. Anything to drink? I've had no news in 3 weeks. I left messages everywhere. So, you want to sleep here? Well, no. Stop, please. The state of you! You disgust me! It's over. I want you out of my head. I'm sick of waiting. Now, get out! - Out! - Come here... You okay? My head is splitting. I've got bad news. The film has been put on hold. What did you say? Sorry, you... You can say "tu"... But you know, these things happen. Horizon Films isn't a big outfit. You say it so casual. I felt it coming, and in the end I'm relieved. I wasn't ready. It'll happen later, in a few months, a year. So what happens to me? I'm sorry. If you're still up for it, next time it'll be you, no one else. I've a plane to catch, I'm off to Caracas for a month. - Taking me? - No... Can I stay here? No, this isn't my pad, I have to leave. So, you're throwing me out? Since we met, you've made a lot of progress. It's sickening. Sure, but what can we do? Bawl our eyes out? Not your thing. It's hard to say "tu" overnight. Anyhow, I don't want to. I know nothing about you, nothing at all. We'll meet again. Like this colour? Ugly, no? Trash! Antoine what? Nothing... It's just you really did help me get over Lucas. Hey, my keys! You're staying. Not into games. 2 nights with Lucas, longer with me. You're sick in the head! - What's going on? - It's her! Burnt her cake for Antoine and she blames me! She told me a hot oven! Liar! Didn't watch your smelly cake! Alright, Antoine? I'm okay. Going to be in the movies? Leave him be. You wouldn't have a cigarette? Smoking is bad for you. I know dear, but sometimes a little folly doesn't hurt. Help me... You're beautiful. I don't care. But you are... and you know it. Means nothing. It does. It means I want you. But, believe me... I'm as scared as you. Before Lucas, I spent 2 years with a woman. She did me good. I thought, this is what I like, the body of a woman. But no... one day I felt, that's not it. In fact, I don't know what I like. Maybe that's why I make films, to know what I like. What's the matter? No! You don't want to come with me? You know, it doesn't mean I've fallen in love. It's just an urge... for a little trip, to help me forget. And the sun... I want sunshine. Not to think of anything. Can I tell you something? One last thing. Tell me what? There's no point anymore in talking. You're right. There's no point. Didn't think you'd come. Mom, this is Antoine. The guy I told you about. Yes, but what to do with all these flowers? It was beautiful. I can't say... I'm totally out of it. So, how're things? Okay. Well... So, I'll call you... Still the same number? Subtitles: Peter Leonard Processed by L.V.T. - Paris
