Hey, what are we doin'? I'm stayin' in his face. Stay in his face. Constant pressure, alright? Constant pressure. Always moving, okay? Never let him initiate the attack. When you're punching, don't throw one punch. Combinations in punching, okay? Try and get some hands on his face, too. You know, elbows and stuff in the clench, in the grind, on the ground. On the ground keep it simple. This kid is very motivated, very hungry, and is lookin' to take georges St. Pierre's title on Saturday night. Ladies and gentlemen, Jon Fitch. You have to live it. It's as simple as that. You gotta live fighting. Daily, you're gonna get punched in the head. Daily, you're gonna get thrown. Daily, you're gonna have soreness. Daily, when you get up in the morning, your knees are gonna hurt, your hips'll hurt, your ears are hurting. It's something that's in you. You're not normal if you choose to be a fighter, and put everything else in the world on hold. There's something wrong with you. There's hidden things down deep in these guys that motivate them to do what they do. I look back at it, if I'm sleepin' in the gutter, at least someone's gonna walk by me one day, "you know who that is? That's pat minihan. "He used to fight in the u.F.C. Too bad he's pushin' a shopping cart around." You tellin' me you want me to fight for two grand? I'm gonna fight for two grand, 'cause I wanna put $2,000 in my pocket. I want to take my girlfriend to the movies. I was basically born to do this, you know? I know it's kinda cheesy, but my dad raised me to be this way. The beauty of this is that I love it so much that even if this is as good as it gets, this is pretty damn good. You know if you put in the work, something good's gonna come out of it. And time and time again, it happens. You put in hard work, do all the things right, something positive comes out of it. We're aggressive, we're not reckless. Head movement, feet movement, in and out, cuttin' angles. Things get tough, keep pushing. We're goin' old school on this guy. - One, two, three. - A.K.A. An accomplishment for me that is kind of... I haven't been able to get my grasp on quite yet is I want a homegrown u.F.C. Champion, and somebody that I've brought up from the beginning to the belt, and that's what I'm hoping to accomplish with Jon Fitch coming up in this next fight. And hopefully, he can get that for himself, and get a little win for me, also. Look, you are dominating. Come on, Jon. No, I'm all right. No, no, you're watching what you're doing. I know, it's okay. But, Fitch, look what you're doing. Aren't you happy with that? - Yeah. - Okay. That's all. You know, I think a lot of people kind of look at us, at a.K.A., and they say we train too hard, they say we hurt too much. But then, if you think about it, I mean, cung le trains here, I train here, Jon Fitch trains here. Bobby southworth trains here, and Trevor prangley trains here, and we all have world titles. Well, Fitch will soon have his. And sometimes, you kinda forget like, who you're wrestling, so, like, man, I got my ass kicked again. I got beat up again. You're comin' home, you're bruised, you're beat up, and then, all of a sudden, you're, like, why am I doin' this? I'm not getting any better. But it's hard to see and hard to Gauge yourself when you're goin' against the best in the world. I feel like the guys we have now are really fortunate that they're plugged into a system that we know exactly what we're doing, and how to create them, how to get them in shape, how to prepare them for what they're going into. I got a broken finger, and my training partner's playing for the title, so I gotta help him out. - No choice. - No choice. Put a fresh guy in every two-and-a- half minutes. Five fuckin' rounds, that's why. Here's what you're getting. You're getting will until you wear him out. Then you're gonna get koss. Then you're gonna finish up with the speedy little back-kicking thomson. - So... - Okay. I know. I don't care how you do it. I just know it's gonna suck. No, it's gonna suck, but... - I got my two minutes, baby. - It's his day today. He's got will, you and you to finish out for his five. All the way through. Nice! On him, on him, on him! Good. Beautiful. Nice, Jon! Nice. One more round. One more good one. Let's go. All right. Set the offense. Circle on the outside. Let the right hand go. Squeeze it! Hands up. Good. A.K.A. If you're showing power, you give 'em less of a chance to come back. I'm gonna give you a perfect example what I'm talking about. Mike Van arsdale with Randy couture. Mike Van arsdale won the first round. All of a sudden, Randy was super tired. Mike Van arsdale didn't wanna come out there. All of a sudden, Randy couture sees Mike Van arsdale in the corner being super tired. He's goin' like this, and I'm telling Mike, I go, suck it up. Randy's tired. All of a sudden, Randy sees Mike getting tired. What did Randy do? Sucked it up and finished him off quick. He gave away that much power. I can't have you do that, okay? That was beautiful, man. He sent us out a videotape. I watched the videotape, and I saw that he was a scrappy wrestler that was aggressive, and not afraid to throw and not afraid to get hit. And Eric tix is just knocked out. Jon Fitch got a very fast knockout on Eric tix. He kinda had two left feet. Couldn't strike very well. Didn't know much on the ground. But he was real hard-nosed. When Bob and I watched that film, and, god, that had to have been maybe eight years ago, Jon really stood out in Bob's mind, because here was a wrestler who wasn't scared to throw punches. I started watching. It's sloppy, but I was fuckin' hella aggressive. Yeah, you were bombin'. Like, fuckin'... He said go, and I was... Aarrrgh!! He just hit the ground, and i'm, aaarrgh! We called him up and had him come out. He stayed at my house for a week. Trained, we liked him, he liked us. Went home, packed all his stuff up in his buick skylark, drove across country, and he's been here ever since. The winner, by unanimous decision, representing the American kickboxing academy, Jon Fitch! I thought he was okay. I didn't think he was great, by any means. I just thought he was okay. Little by little, though, Jon Fitch was one of those rare individuals that has what it takes to be a great champion. He's got the mind. I think I love the training. I love... you know, it sucks, the daily routine of working out and being beat up, whatever, but something about me loves it, I think, 'cause it makes sense, and it's an honest thing. The world we live in is not very honest, you know. People get shortcuts and freebies all the time. But, like, with fighting, it's rare that you get a freebie or a shortcut. Yeah, actually. You know that point where all I think about is food? No, you look good. You look good, too. Where's the rest of the crew? Pick me up early. And have breakfast there. - That's fair. - That's fair. See, I dressed a little nicer today. I'm impressed. Oops. Shit! How are you doing? Hi. Thanks for catching me. Wow, I'm impressed. - That's still jaywalking. - Hmm? That's still jaywalking. That's all right. Could have him teach me something French to say. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. That'd be funny. I will break you. Something nice or...? I will break you? I must break you. What is that? - It's a "j." - It's a "j"? - That's a "j." - I'm sorry. Remember that line is "j." Okay, yeah. Every fight that he's had in the u.F.C., my heart beats a little faster. It's to the point where it makes me, like, anxious, like, nervous, uncomfortable. When we met, she was, like, oh, yeah, whatever. Sure, you're a fighter. She didn't pay it much attention. She didn't care about any of that stuff. I hate sitting close, because you can hear the contact. It just makes it more real. When you're sitting far away, you can't really hear all that. She gets really nervous about the fights. She's gotta sit kinda far away, and she usually has to have two or three drinks before she watches, otherwise, she's a nervous wreck. It's like a joke in our gym. Can't finish with me. Now I'm on the bottom. The worst possible... No way? That just happened right there? I brought fruit for you guys. Today's your birthday? Did she really just do that to you? Did she really just do that to you? Huge difference between American kickboxing academy and a lot of other corners and camps. It's experience. Has nothing to do with what they're doing wrong or whatever it is. It's experience. We have a lot of experience. There's a reality there. We're one of the best mmhm's in the world, I think. One of the best teams. Gettin' on the team is not easy, but it can be done with hard work. I mean, it doesn't have to be incredible talent. Jon Fitch is proof of that, and Jon Fitch could very easily go down as one of the great m.M.A. Fighters of all time. We're masterminds. You know, Javier, Bob cook, huitzi, Teddy lucio. Dave camarillo. We sit together, and we study tape, and we're masterminds. If you listen to our game plan, and you stick to it, your chances of winning are huge. You know, at first it was, I'm gonna fight, but i'm also gonna get a job. I'll have my job, and I can train, I'll use my degrees for something. The more and more serious I got about it, the more fights I had. Came out for a week, kinda tried out for the team. They said I was accepted. And about a month later, I drove my car out here. Packed all my stuff in my car, and didn't look back. I didn't know how big a deal it was, because I didn't know a lot of people don't get accepted, and how exclusive it is, and how much it would change my life, because training there has just been phenomenal. - Mike fazzino. - Here. - Matt green. - Here. Jaime Rodriguez. Oakland. - Gabriel solorio. - Here. - Josh Neal. - Here. - Raul castillo. - Here. - Kurt osiander. - Here. - Nate Moore. - Here. We're good. "Butting with the head, eye gouging of any kind, "biting, hair pulling, fish hooking, "clawing, pinching, or twisting the flesh. "Putting a finger into any orifice, "or any cut or laceration of your opponent. Small joint manipulation." If you're gonna peel the hand off, it's gotta be three fingers or more. That's what you're talking about. That's right. Nate Moore! Hey, I saw your promo fight yesterday. - I was watching silva. - It was pretty cool. Still kinda weird seeing myself on TV. - Yeah? - Yeah. How's the training coming along? - Good. - Yeah? Tired. I'm glad to have the day off. You win that fight, what you gonna be? One? Middleweight? I'm fighting for the belt. - For the belt. - So he would be... So I'll be world champion if I win this fight. - In your weight. - Welterweight, yes. Hi. Aah! He's nice. Can you pet him? Hm? - What's his name? - It's bricks. - Bricks? - Bricks. Yep. These are my new gloves. Don't take them. I just had to buy some, or hoff had to. Thanks, hoff. Dude, I swear, I've had all this nice equipment. I see fighters up there. One guy's got my shin guards on, the other guy's got my gloves on. Borrowed indefinitely? No, no, it's known as misappropriation of property. That's what it is. I found these about six months ago. I found these two weeks ago. These were given to me. So is there hope for my equipment or...? Someone gave me this. I found these about a year ago. This just appeared in here, got the stickers on it. This is... What do you do, pat? I do, like, the ultimate fighting. Whoa! What's that? Is that like fight club? No, no. You ever see the cage around the ring? Uh, no, I never seen that. I go, well, that's what I do. Pat minihan... Never seen someone like-- he's just a maniac. He's just gonna keep comin', and he's big and strong, and he's full of a lot of piss and vinegar. He sacrificed a lot. He used to live 100 yards from me right now, in an r.V. In our parking lot. He's a warrior. Talk about sacrifice. He wakes up in the morning, he hears the car next to him park, gets out, goes to the gym, and trains. This stuff right here is cracking. Your best bet in the rainy season is just put a frickin' tarp. Pretty much, the thing that's cool about living in here is that you don't have to pay rent. But in the winter, it gets cold. I got, like, four different flus sleepin' in this thing. Basically folds out into a bed, and, uh, I used to sleep here, and my dog used to sleep here. He invited me in, and I was, like, uh... I'm good. Basically, where that flames truck is, right there, that's where I usually parked it. Right where the flames truck is. We used to battle for position. Not a lot of people wanted to park next to an r.V. For some reason. And it'd be like a fair, because some white trash people would come out over here, and they parked kinda side to side with me, and i'm, like, you can't be in here. You need to leave. This is my territory. There's a big disparity between the guys in the gym-- the haves and the have-nots. We have people livin' in the gym, they just started out. We actually converted Bob's office, crazy Bob's office, into a room. It's got a bunk bed in there now. They live up in the gym. They live in warehouses, they work at bars. Next thing you know, they're on a trip to go fight in the u.F.C. Somebody needs some help, there's always somebody that says, hey, well, I've got an extra room, or I've got this. Yeah, this is gonna be home for about two nights. Drive 300 feet. Maybe I should turn the volume down on that. When you come back, park across the street. Right here... No, across the street. Oh, across that... - No. 162. - 162? That's Michelle's parking spot, park there. I'll park somewhere around here. Okay. From the time I've been on the team, I've slept everywhere from a warehouse, people's couches, in the back of my car, with the window broken when it's raining. There was rats and machines goin' off all the time, and mosquitoes, and you spill your drink, you don't clean it. It's just a warehouse. Part of mixed martial arts is that suffering, and you gotta do what you gotta do to get where you wanna be. Yeah, those are still some of the best gloves, man. - Yeah, they're very good. - They really are. They're super safe. I don't have any hand problems with 'em either. We do bag work and small mitt work sometimes, too. Can I get a pair of these? - Who are you looking for? - For my girlfriend. - Size small? - Yeah. There's that style, too. I think I had blonde hair for this. Where is the-- let's see what Scotty says about Fitch. This is the debut here. - Let's get some volume. - Yeah, where is it? Scotty's probably talkin' trash. Blonde guy. Jon Fitch. You'll be hearing a lot from this guy. Oh, they spelled the name wrong. This guy's tough. I trained with him down at a.K.A. Former wrestling captain at purdue. How famous is this guy you're fighting? Combine the two together, the traditional jiu-jitsu game with the wrestling base, you got a monster on your hands. Yeah, once he gets his technique dialed in, he's gonna be a big monster. He's a super strong guy. Tons of heart. I talked to him about his hair. See, this is the best part. You gotta listen to the whole thing over again. You may have to live with me for a little bit. - Me? - Yeah. Matt major's comin' back, and I sure the hell don't want him livin' with me. The anti-Christ. Don't fuck with Matt. Let me think about it for a second. Okay! Matt comes out of Florida. He's another one that sent a tape. And he's a real character. You want me to, all of a sudden, you come in and change the lineup for you? Not gonna happen. Whatever. Come on. One round. No. No rounds. You're out of the loop, unless I need you. I just wanna get paid. I wanna get paid so I can take care of my family, so I can buy my girlfriend nice things, so I can live like a rock star. I wanna drive a lamborghini when I'm 30. I wanna be a hope for a little black kid in Miami. I wanna go back to my hood when Christmas comes up, and buy 1,000 bikes for every kid in the neighborhood. That's what I wanna do. They stole my freakin' gloves, man. If he didn't leave his shit everywhere, it'd be easier to find it. You gotta put your stuff away, man. I put it in my bag, dude! I put it in my bag. - That's... - R-a. R-a. No "h." All right. She's a professional. When we first started, we would just hear about a fight, because I was in Indiana. We would hear about a fight that was goin' on in, like, Minnesota, or we'd hear about a fight in Iowa, and we'd just pack up the car and drive there, weigh in, and hopefully have somebody that matches up. So you might drive all the way out there, and you don't know what you're gonna get paid, you have no idea if you're even gonna get a fight. You're actually tied right now with Royce Gracie's record - for most consecutive wins in the u.F.C. - Without a loss. Yeah, um, I don't really pay much attention to it, actually, 'cause I'm always lookin', like, forward. When I retire, then I'll look back, and go, oh, yeah, that's cool. I did all this stuff. 'Cause now, I take it one fight at a time, and I don't even realize the stuff I've done, except the mistakes. I always dwell on the mistakes I've made. I lost my very first fight because I was an idiot, and I started off a lot higher level than I should have. I flew out without a corner. I didn't have a cup. You never wrestle with a cup. Why would you need a cup to fight in? It didn't make sense to me. They're kickin' at ya, like somebody's swingin' a baseball bat in your groin area. I didn't put two and two together. So actually, I had to borrow a cup. I borrowed a cup, and afterwards, he said, keep it. I just got an email from one of my friends. They took a picture. They got a billboard up in Times Square right now. And it's got your picture? Yeah, me and St. Pierre. It's fuckin' sweet. I saw you on the poster, and you're, like... I thought it was so weird, 'cause Brock Larson, they spent a lot of money on that dude, he was little, and you're, like, huge. I'm huge, towering over Brock, yeah. First time ever. Yeah, hopefully, we get it done, but we're gettin' real pinched on time. And if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. We've got a lot on board already, and things are good. Obviously, ultimately, that's the goal. Dale, dewayne and Bob. How's it going? Good. How are you? Doin' good, doin' good. Good. We were calling you in regards to Fitch. I know you said you were highly interested - in his shirt. - Okay. The shirt is available, however, we're gonna have to do a non-exclusive deal with it, so therefore, we're gonna have to make sure we can get another sponsor on the shirt. Okay. Who would that be? Most likely, it'll be someone who isn't a competing force to you. We got Fitch comin' up on the ninth. Are you in on him? - Yeah. - Okay. We'll put you down, and we'll run you at the usual? For the champ? For the champ. That's right. First welterweight champ. It's growing. It's the number one pay-per-view in America, over boxing and over w.W.E. Wrestling. I mean, this is where it's at right now. Really, it was just a hobby for dewayne and I for probably the first five to six years. Basically supporting fighters, helping 'em out, doing whatever we can do without being paid back. There was a time where we were wondering if it was gonna be around much more. The companies were struggling, fighters were struggling, there was no endorsements. I mean, endorsements meant you got a box of free t-shirts. I was having a hard time, I couldn't get fights. I couldn't even get on a show where anybody would show up to fights. I had no name, even though I was beating decent people. I was fighting and training for about a month and a half with this guy named Ron. He had one leg. I mean, Ron was tough, but still, he's got one leg. One day... I'd had him for about a month and a half, and I broke his hand when we were grappling. So now he had one leg and no hand. ...he was getting fights canceled, and having to take fights in Mexico, and this, that, and the other. He was extremely motivated. And he tackled every task, and he won every fight. I think all these unfortunate things that happened to him has made him so strong mentally, and so hungry for that success, and to make it to the top. That's why he's been unstoppable. I mean, he has a hunger that a lot of guys haven't, because he didn't get the easy road. Protect yourself. Second leg, second leg. Fitch, just flatten him out. Angle right and flatten him out. Fitch, angle right. If Bob makes a match for you guys, you guys better damn well be in shape. 'Cause the last thing I wanna do is listen to you guys cry in the dressing room and after about how you lost your fight because, blah, I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that. Well, did you do your homework? If you're not doin' your homework, you're not gettin' an "a," you're not gettin' the best grade possible, are you? No. I'm bummed I'm gonna miss the fight. - Are you? - I mean, I'll watch it, but I won't be able to come. I have a music festival that night. Oh, okay. Get a jumbo-tron. I fought dino Sanchez the night of his wedding. Did you go to the wedding? I went to the wedding. It was my wedding. We wanted to put the fight where the head's supposed to be on the mannequin. I tried to put it out of my head. I had two things, and, like, well, put that aside, ya know. And then, we were dancing, and they announced, Fitch won. It just made everything perfect. Well, I'll be pullin' for ya. Thanks, man. It's a rock star job. We don't really do anything that... That we have to. I mean, we do show up to work, but we don't have to get anybody coffee or anything. We seen your fight, dude. - Good luck, man. - Thank you. - Congratulations, bro. - Thank you. We seen the fight yesterday, and i'm, all, baby, that's him, that's him. You're off the hook, bro. Off the hook. - Congratulations. - Congratulations, man. - Keep goin', man. - I will. I want a hug. You represent hope. Thank you. You're famous. He's famous. It's a job that not everybody can do, and it's an experience that many people haven't experienced. It's a very unique feeling to be in the octagon. You get in the cage, the lights are on you, everything goes into slow motion. Everything goes slow motion to real fast, and the punches are swingin'. Losing is the least of my worries, really. What's your biggest worry? Just bein' hurt, and I can't fight next time, because then I gotta get a real job. I really don't wanna do that. That's it. Nice. I went to juvie for a little while. One of the guards was sayin', like, you're a big guy. You should be a fighter. And I was, like, ah, I could never do that. Those guys are maniacs. Do you know who in the fuck this is? Do you know who this is? Attaboy, Jon. Don't try that elementary schoolyard shit. I just cold-called the gym, and Javier picked up the phone. Javier never answers the phone. But that day, he answered the phone. When Josh thomson, even though he's punching you in the face, and he's tellin' you to get up, and you don't have a mouthpiece in. Well, you know what? Josh thomson's a world champion. He doesn't need to punch you in the face and tell you to get up. He can just roll with some other chump, and help that guy out, ya know. That's pretty awesome. - Um, Zack. - Zack? Yeah. Z-a-c-k. How do you go about cutting weight? I know that some fighters do it, like, six weeks, eight weeks. No, like, two days, man. I drop anywhere from 14 to 18 pounds in two days. - How much? - Two days. - 18 pounds in two days? - Yeah. Really, like, a day and a half. I'll start-- weigh-ins will be on a Friday. I'll start Thursday night, finish Friday morning. - John. - Isaac. - I'm the manager here. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks. - No problem. You're awesome, man. Can't wait to see you guys fight. We also have a celebrity here. Jon Fitch, if you know who that is. If you don't, he's the future 170-pound world champion... No, this is live. Thanks, man. Whip his ass. That fucking canuck, back to fucking Canada. I will, bro. - Have a good night. - Bye. Okay, this guy's got a pretty decent record. I don't know if it's decent. It's ten, eight and one. B.j. Lacy. He's fought some bigger guys though. I'm tryin' to find some footage online to get an idea of what his fighting style is, and see which guy he matches up best with. Do we have anything in the works for Nate James at this time? No. It's gonna be a tough fight for him, but he could probably get him. Yeah, let's call him. Let's talk to him and see if he wants this fight. Hey, Nate. You wanna fight this Saturday? This Saturday. It's not a whole lot of money. It's only... It's 15 and a grand, so 2,500. The guy's b.J. Lacy. He's ten and eight and one. I give myself a two-year window to do something. I'm a year and a half into it. And so, when this two years is up, I've got to decide basically should I continue, am I finding success in this, and if not, I'll be broken-hearted. I think I'm doin' all the right things. I'm tryin' to do all the right things to make sure that I do stay in this for a long time. All right, shut him down. Left hook. Choke him. Finish, finish! Finish! You're not that bad. You're okay, you're okay. Listen to Bob. Listen to him. You gotta listen. Back to the legs, back to the legs! Hand position, back to the legs. Hand position, back to the legs! You need to do something. Push off! Quit hitting and get outta there! You gotta go out and fuckin' finish this guy. You ain't got no other fuckin' rounds, do you understand? You need to listen to what Bob is telling you. You got three minutes to let it go, and you can't settle for nothin'. Right now, baby. Stand up! Go! Get on the legs! You gotta want it, Nate. That's not acceptable. Finish him! Finish, finish! Finish him! Finish him! By a split decision, b.j. "Da beast" Lacy! I don't know who's more pissed, me or you. How do you feel, champ? You didn't stick to the strategy at all. You settled for position when you shouldn't have. You didn't listen for nothin'. We shouldn't have lost that fight. There's no reason we lost that fight. Let me ask you a question. Could you hear us? I know you could hear my ass. Everybody in the damn building could hear. Were you able to hear us? I was trying. So you got through it. That not what I need to be doin', just gettin' through it. But you can't have an all-star day every day. I intend to have at least one. I didn't get... In my last two fights, two takedowns, all in both camps, and I get eight takedowns between two fights, man. It just happens like that. You know that. You see him right now, he's mentally a little bit broken down, because you're dealing with someone that has... That's dealing with fresh people. So that person that comes in for one round, he's on cloud nine. "I'm just gonna beat you up." 'Cause he knows he can get out in one round. He doesn't gotta deal with you anymore. The next guy comes in, whereas that same guy... Fitch has gotta be in there for the whole five rounds. It's always a fresh guy, and that just starts breakin' you mentally, and then, when you have one bad round against a fresh guy, you're thinking you should be doing better, when in reality, you're in the fifth round, you just fought 25 minutes, and that guy's only fought two minutes. I failed miserably many times throughout my life, so I just keep at it. I try to refer to it to people as, like, drivin' through the mud. You gotta keep the tires movin'. You gotta keep goin', otherwise you're gonna get stuck. Relax, relax, relax. Kick him backwards. I felt it pull back. Matt, what did you feel? What hurts, Matt? Don't put me on. No, dude. I'm not doin' that. Sometimes it doesn't feel bad; When you cool down, it's gonna get worse. I'm not nobody's punch highlight reel, man. I'm fuckin' hurtin', man, and these little punks take advantage of me and shit. I'm hurt. I hate trainin' at a.K.A., man. It's just too much fuckin' pain. I'll go across the whole United States and... I don't know... just a bunch of pussies, ya know. I come here, and nobody's a pussy, so... They train, we train pretty hard. It's like real fights in there, man. I take it serious. I try to hurt people when I'm in there. Period. Today, with Matt and Luke... You could just tell as soon as they squared off with each other, ya know, something's gonna happen. We're trying to kick each other's ass, but at the same time, we gotta do it somewhat safety conscious, so we all can make our fights, and hope we make a couple of dollars at the end of the day. And we're all sacrificing our bodies to each other. You know, that commands respect. And you have to respect that because... I'm not saying Matt twisting his ankle-- that was just incidental, but if you're bringing your personal stuff in here, and takin' 'em out on your teammates, something negative is gonna happen from that. I heard that Luke stole Matt's gloves. Okay, let's get this ear thing done. Let's get rid of it. I hate needles, man. You need to do it. Can it wait till tomorrow? No, you need to do it now so you can get some sleep. Are you icing it at all? No. Ice. What's ice? This is a little puny needle. I needed a bigger one. It works better. Is that all we got? Yeah, what is this, Botox? Quit stallin'. Let's get this shit over with. I got shit to do. Got everything? I got everything. Quit stallin'. Lay down. Fuck! Come on, man! You come on. I do not like needles! You're bein' a fuckin' sissy. Shit, there's hardly even anything there. Then fuck it. Ice it. No, lay down, lay down. - I'll ice it. - Lay down. There's almost no blood swelling. How disappointing. Shit! I was lookin' forward to stickin' him. This life... Has cauliflower ears as part of it. The contract it has... Living in the gym as part of the contract it has. Potential staph infections, whatever it is. It's a tough life. It's not easy. It's getting punched in the face, it's getting smashed on the ground. It's getting arm-barred, it's getting choked, every single day. One week of training left. About halfway through sunday. So week 11, and then, week 12 is fight week. Let's go. Get on that bike, Jon. Let's go, go, go. Faster. It's not fast enough. Let's go, faster. Let's go, Jon! Break it. Come on. Break it, let's go! More. More, more, more. You're almost there. Let's go! Come on, no pause. Let's go. Punch and go. That's it. Okay, against the wall. I'd like to keep him a little bit more with smaller guys. Smaller guys. I know. Nate... So will's good, pat's good. Pat is needed for Phil, as I understand it. Do the bit. And then go... You can do three. Right? Okay. - I know I got two in me. - Okay. Come on, will, you gotta move. Nice work. Beautiful! Beautiful. Hands up! U.f.c. Champ right there! He's just done what we've all planned to do. We all show up, and he trains, and we train him, and next thing you know, he's a superstar, because he goes out and performs. This is the biggest thing I've ever been a part of. The biggest thing. And like I said, I feel closer to Fitch than some of the other guys. I think I'm just a fan of his mannerisms, and how he carries himself, and his humbleness, more than anything. You get a guy up there who's fighting for the title, who's that humble, you know, in a sport where... It literally pays to be cocky. I just... I think everything's gonna come together that Saturday. It's just gonna be a great day. Would I take any of it back? Hell, no. Would I change anything? Hell, no. This is what I am, this is what I enjoy doing. Like I said, when it becomes a job, I'll quit doin' it, but right now, it's not. I don't wanna grow up and wake up when I was 40, and say, I spent my whole life around the cornfields. I wanna experience something different. I want that one big fight. I want that guy who's gonna bring the fight out in me, and I'll bring the fight out in him, and we'll go to war. One of us is gonna fall. I want people to look back and go, that was one of the baddest fights I've ever seen. So I wanted to come here and show them I'm a team player, and that I want to be where these guys are. And I know I'm not gonna get there overnight, so, hey, I'm gonna be the best team player that I can be, and by osmosis, I'll be there. I'm not goin' anywhere. As much as I complain and talk shit, I ain't goin' nowhere. This is my team, I'm not going anywhere, I'm always gonna be here, no matter what. Next week, we're gonna start taperin' 'em down. We're gonna keep workin' the smaller guys, and just stay hard on the cardio, stay hard on the... Even in the jiu-jitsu, we wanna be a little bit careful. The guys are a little bit safety conscious. We're where we need to be right now. Everything is on. Partner up, let's go. We just gotta keep the momentum, keep 'em in shape, and we're good to go. Timing's good, everything's good. I thought we had a great chance goin' into this, but I never thought he would look that good. - I gotta be honest. - Yeah, g.S.P. Is the underdog. He's a totally different fighter. Fucking lost a bag. This is the worst airline ever. Oh, man. You don't see it anywhere? I had to pay 25 fucking dollars to put it on the plane, too. I can't explain it, but it just happened. It happens all the time. We will deliver it to you. I need you to fill that out. This is the home of prince. U2 has been here. Bruce Springsteen's been here. The Minnesota timberwolves play at the target center. So you think of all those different acts, and the fact that none of them have ever, ya know, produced as much revenue as this u.F.C. Event. I think that's kinda shocking to some people. Probably the toughest guy to come out of a.K.A. That's a pretty bold statement, being one of the best mixed martial arts academies in the world. This kid is very motivated, he's very hungry, and is lookin' to take georges St. Pierre's title on Saturday night. Ladies and gentlemen, Jon Fitch. I wanna thank everybody for comin' out tonight. I'm really excited about this fight. I worked very hard for it. We'll put on a hell of a show and a hell of a fight, and I plan on takin' that belt on Saturday night. It's startin' to hit me right now really, now that you said that. I don't want it to hit me. I wanna relax, and then, uh... But I've done this 100 times, man. I've been here so many times. It's different this time, though. It's different. It's not just the last 12 weeks. It's the last seven years. Come fight time, I'm gonna be a mess, ya know. I'm gonna be a mess, just like all our other three coaches. We're gonna be a mess, 'cause we're gonna be, like, wow, this is it. And Jon's gonna be worse off than us. You gonna eat some stuff that you got from the store? Yeah, it's right here. So you wanna... - This is huitzi. - Hi, huitzi. This is my mom Cindy. I'm a very spiritual person, because I want to be me. I'm not religious, but I see this as, I guess you call it spirituality. Spiritual, you know. He's got his spirits. Yes. His necklace. Everything else up to this point has gone fantastic, so as long as he can get some decent sleep between now and then, the weight cut shouldn't be an issue. You know, as long as he doesn't stub his toe crossin' the street, break his ankle or something, we're good. Hey, I realized something about your woman. What? She's crazy? She can't go a day without callin' you stupid. Oh, did I call him stupid? - We're from Nebraska. Where are you from? - Indiana. Indiana? Nice to meet you. Say u.F.C. Title. U.f.c. Title. Yeah, baby. It's different. You know, if we lose, it's gonna hurt probably more than the other ones. 'Cause you don't get this chance uh, whenever you want it. It's a ladder. You lose, you get knocked down to the beginning. You're only as good as your last fight. If you have a bad performance, and you lose, all of a sudden, it's like your rankings and the fans, and just everything, it's just, uh... It's black and white between winning and losing. Watch a guy like g.S.P., who I think is just a great athlete, watch him perform in the ring. It's pretty amazing. Oh, I think he's a great fighter. He's a very talented fighter, and I think he represents sort of the new breed of u.F.C. Fighters. His potential has no bounds. I think he's shown that. It's gonna be very hard for anybody to beat him probably from 170, probably up to 205. He's that good. He's probably top three pound-for-pound fighters in the entire world. When we were at San Jose, I told him, oh, man. I wish that we can come across with georges St. Pierre, to see how he's gonna react when he sees you or he sees me, because I think I have a strong sight. I can go deep into your soul, into your spirit, and make you feel a little bit uncomfortable. We were goin' out to eat and ran into Greg Jackson, and St. Pierre and his camp. So when I look, georges kinda like, he didn't wanna look at Jon, and he tried to look down, but then I see that he was like, when you are surrounded by enemies. He seemed like he was a little uncomfortable, actually. I don't know if he was just surprised, or in shock that we ran into him, or if he's worried. I know he was worried. He didn't wanna look, he was nervous. I say, well, we won the first round. You know, with him, the focus is usually just makin' weight. Bob normally does the... What do you call it? I mean, I do whatever you want me to do, but I'm here for moral support. - Same? - The same. This is point six heavy. It's a little bit light, compared to the other one. Usually, when your shorts are wet, it means they're on weight. No more! I'm not Canadian. I'm gonna head down there now. Good luck. I don't think Jon Fitch is afraid of much. Just watchin' him this week, he's not in awe of georges St. Pierre. He very much believes that he'll win this fight Saturday. I was just talkin' to some of the guys earlier. Everybody's got a plan, where they're goin', who they're goin' with, to go watch the fight. It's the team that's goin' for the gold. Am I gonna miss this moment? Yeah. Of course. I... for a moment, I went to the cage, and I see Jon. Yeah! Winning with a big belt here on his waist. Hello. Okay. 7:45. All right. They want you in the lobby at 7:45. That guy sounded like a spy or something. He's all secretive. He's all, they want you in the lobby at 7:45. That's when we'll give you the briefcase. He will be a star tonight. I can't guarantee the win. I can guarantee he will be a star, because he's gonna perform like one. I believe he's gonna go out there, and he's gonna leave it all in the ring. Whichever way it happens, it happens, but that's the kind of guy he is. He's gonna put his heart and soul out there, and we'll see it. Hey, it's 7:38. Good luck. - Let's go. - Bye. - Bye. We'll see you later. - Take care of him. Hey, you're gaining. We were 27% last time. We're aggressive, but we're not reckless. Head movement, feet movement. In and out, cuttin' angles, in the clinch. Damaging him, him not damaging you. Try to get some hands on his face. Some elbows and stuff in the clinch, in the grind, on the ground. Keep it simple. Last thing, no fuckin' lazy kicking. Nothing's lazy. Everything's fast aggressive. Things get tough, keep pushing. - One, two, three. - A.K.A. As you come out of the tunnel, you can feel the energy of the crowd. There was nothing else in the world. All his dreams and hopes to be the world champion, they're all at stake. I was completely in that moment. G.s.p. Came out and gets nailed. He bloodied my eye, made me see double. Everything else kinda goes out the window. G.s.p. Caught him with a beautiful straight shot. Can Jon continue; Should we continue? Everybody's watching, all your friends, all your family. Everybody in the gym. It's like having one of your best friends out there. You don't have it in your head to stop or quit. He just went out there and out-pointed him. Jon just came after him. He does not stop. He just keeps looking forward. All of a sudden, boom, he got nailed again. He was able to get to my back. He reversed g.S.P. And started doing some damage. Jon still had that desire to fight, the desire to win. He was saying, I'm gonna get into the crowd. Jon kept comin', and he didn't stop. It was such an incredible display of courage. Unbelievable performance. It was just amazing. Keepin' my phone blown up. People are blown away. He fought with his whole fuckin' heart. That's all you can ask for. We never got that moment to exploit. I did stuff, you know. After the third round, I was looking at the clock, and Jon Fitch, he never died. I tried to finish him. After the first round, I tried everything. I saw him, like, like, fell down and come back. I was, like, my god, what am I gonna have to do to beat this guy? Hey, Jon. Good fight, Jon. Good job, Jon. You fought great, bro. We all love ya. You fought great. I didn't get tired, Bob. - No, you didn't. - No, you didn't get tired. That's probably why you look like that. If this is what happens when you get tired... Is it time for jokes? Unbelievable. I mean, that fight is unbelievable. He put his heart on the outside and showed it to the world. What's up, baby?!
