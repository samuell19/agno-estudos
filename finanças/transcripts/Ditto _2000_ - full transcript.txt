Satisfied? But I think it's odd to wait for a stranger for 2 hours in the rain? I've never seen her. So I waited for her Frankly, I wouldn't wait for you. Understand? Bastard! What? Hello? - Go home and get some rest - I'm going - Home? - You don't have to know - Why not? - It's none of your business Hey, leave me the umbrella How come you didn't show up?

I was waiting for you for over 2 hours getting dust all over me Dust? You mean, dust in the rain? Rain? What rain? What are you talking about? It's bright and sunny Really? Are you sure you're in Korea? Not Japan or China? Wait a minute! 45a. Can't you hear the sound? It's been raining for days. Are you saying I'm crazy? Stop pulling my leg and turn off the shower!

Even soldiers don't fight if they're not fed And you did what with a disconnected HAM radio? It doesn't make sense, right? Then something's wrong with the radio? No, something's wrong with you! What's up? He's gone mad. I think he's been struck by lightning Then he should be back to normal - He was a strange one - You're right Right, I wish I was struck by lightning What are you doing? Fixing something Why do you need both of you to fix it? Sir, why don't you take her? She's bothering me Why are you bothering him? Go home. It's not the place for a girl Is this a boys' dorm or something? Hyunji, my friend. Get lost! Frankly, I can't even find a hole because of you! Isn't that a simple machine? You just talk and listen - I've been waiting for you - I just got home - I see, got home late - Why, did you wait for me? I don't think we have anything to talk about Well...I just wanna apologize... I was rude Guess it's raining still? Not today So, what grade are you in? A junior Oh, you're older... I'm a sophomore Wait! Then should I call you older sister? No, you don't have to do that. I don't want a little brother like you We should be the same age since I went to school a year early Came to school in 77 Oh, I see - What year did you say? - Yes? Why? I thought I heard it wrong 77. Did you hear it right this time? No, I heard it wrong again. Just a minute, you mean... when you say 77, does it mean the year 1977? We usually say 77 short for 1977 If you're joking, it's not funny What? What I mean is you sound so sincere How do you do that? We are the same age and go to the same school... but I came to school in 77 Short for 1977 So, you came in 1999 and now you attend school in the year 2000? Last time I checked. If you're right, you're talking to me after the end of the world Finished? What year is this? What? What the hell's wrong? I'm going. Are you going? What? So... You were flirting with someone old? You pervert, or maybe she is She entered school in 1977. But she's still in school I don't think she's neither kidding nor crazy Hey, that's simple She got into school in 1977 and she's now a junior Yeah, she had some time off, maybe for 20 years? Maybe she was in the Army for a long time... or got married and had babies Why are you here? Your bus doesn't stop here It's too late for the bus. We'll take a cab I'll drop you off Donghee! Oh, Soeun Have a seat here What are your plans after graduation? Such serious subject over lunch Well...maybe office worker? Or... A politician? A congressman? I'm interested in politics but you never know Who knows? I may just play around before the world ends? - It won't end - What? You know they say the world will end in 1999 But it won't How do you know? Well, isn't it a happy thought anyhow? I see... Don't you like this? I'll eat it No wonder I couldn't find you Who'd think you'd be in the library? What do you want? A letter from your parents in America What are you doing with my letter? You never open your mailbox. You should thank me OK. By the way, how do I checkout books? I've never done it I knew it. Wait here Ma'am! What's the procedure for checking out books? Fill out the form and I need student I.D. Student I.D.? No one carries that How about a driver's license? Don't you have class? We have the same classes When you don't have one, I don't have one Stop annoying me Annoying? Bastard! I'm not a humanist. I don't have time to annoy assholes like you Here. Read it Damn it. Why are you telling me to read my letter? You read it. I'm sure it's nothing Do you really want me to read it? - Oh my god! - What? What handwriting! She writes like a young person. Meticulous and pretty Just read it. Ask me if you run into a difficult word So complicated. So many things happened in October, 1979 So complicated. The house, weather, Dad Anyway, she wants you to write often PS. You didn't forget mom's birthday? What's the date today? Today? 5th, why? Forgot to send her present! Hey, are you making fun of me? Wear it when you get better You'll get better quicker to wear it Thanks, my friend I should have gotten you a short skirt So you won't ride a bicycle Leaving so soon? Sorry. Let's celebrate when you get better You're really blinded by love, aren't you? - Go, fly to your love - I'm flying Sorry to make you wait You didn't have to come out so quickly - It's OK. Let's go - OK Oh, Lord! I was saying... In Year 2000, do you think people still talk at night? As long as there's night, people will still talk at night It's late. I have to go Are your parents strict? No, but I have to jump over the wall if it's too late How can a wall come between us? It was a line from the movie we saw Oh, I see... Have to go. Gotta make it before the curfew Your face...tiny Calling CQ, CQ, CQ... Yes, you're in 1979 and I'm in 2000 And one of us is being very silly Or one of us is seriously crazy Let me ask you one thing Do you recall anything on the news from yesterday? I don't even know why we're talking in the first place But sure... Youngsam Kim was expelled from the National Assembly Student demonstrations are everywhere Do you have a 1979 archive or something? What? No. Nothing Does it say that the expelled person would be a president 14 years later? What the hell are you talking about? Soeun, listen In this world, there are many unexplainable incidents Those always...come on TV I thought they were made up If you keep talking nonsense, let's stop I know it must be nonsense to you. So we couldn't go on But listen carefully! You're a junior in 1979 and... I'm a sophomore and my calendar says it's Year 2000 It's your news for tomorrow Pusan will be placed under martial law At school, a completion ceremony for the clock tower will be held But it'll be postponed. The Dean will have a heart attack What? Ah...you must respect the Dean But don't worry. He'll be back next month for the ceremony Oh, yeah? Don't you have any other news? Like a mermaid found in the river or an earthquake in Seoul How about the death of the President? The President will die on the 26th of this month But no mermaid nor an earthquake OK, I'm not asking you to believe me. We'll talk tomorrow Sure. Let's stop. It's the Curfew time already The Curfew... Jesus! PUSAN UNDER MATIAL LAW The completion ceremony for the clock tower will be postponed... Hello? Hey, you responded right away. In a hurry? Who are you? What's going on? It's simple. I live in 2000 I can find information about 1979 just like that Does that mean you believe that I live in 1979? I have no choice Then it's my turn to believe You probably have no choice Donghee... What's up? Waiting for you. Are you free this afternoon? Gee, I've got something on Would it finish late? Anything wrong? No, I just... I don't mean to refuse a surprise date offer It's OK. Going home? No, I have to stop by the hospital Oh, the broken leg! She's funny Yes, she's nice and pretty Gotta go - OK - Bye Let's go So a guy from Year 2000 is making a pass at you? No, I don't think he's a bad guy See? You're already falling for him Falling for who? You're already falling for someone whom you've never met He must be a con artist. Call the police He's trying to get to your soft side... by lying about Year 2000 Let's get him arrested - Sunmi... - Yeah He does live in Year 2000 I understand I know when you love someone, you don't want to meet another person So let him be Why am I still in a cast? We should set some rules Don't know how we're communicating but... I could give you a fortune beyond your imagination... but that's morally wrong A fortune? Related to personal wealth For example, I could tell you real estate information Or I could tell you what stock to buy and strike it rich I agree. Shouldn't do that But I'm from the past and you're in the future So I'm more curious Curiosity? Naive curiosity How's the future world? I guess compared to 1979, it's very convenient Subways are everywhere under the city What about the Unification? Ilsung Kim is dead but no Unification yet Gosh, he dies too We can travel to Mt. Kumkang in the north though Wow, must be exciting! Is it beautiful? Worth living in the world? As always, the world is a good place to be in Of course, there is pollution and population problems So some people reminisce about what it used to be like Really? Um... I wonder what they reminisce about... I wish I could see the year 2000 I wish I could show you This world is full of things you were imagining... I mean, things you couldn't imagine became reality In that world, if you really love someone is there a way to make him love me? I don't think it will ever be invented Oh, are you in love? Oops! No! It's OK. I'm from a different world anyway I don't know the definition of love but I can guess it He...looks at my eyes each one at a time He... What am I saying? I only say to this to my diary I can be your diary for a while. A talking diary Have you someone you love? Me? Yes, I do How much did you drink? I can smell your alcohol from last night Not last night. This morning. Hangover chaser! Hey, get closer! Be quiet and keep a straight face I can't keep a straight face when I'm with him Don't open your mouth. It stinks So are you still talking to that woman from 1979? Why ask? You don't even believe me I believe you You're communicating with someone from 1979 every night You're interested in her But you can't do shit... because she's from another time I believe that What the hell are you saying? And watch your language You start cursing when you get jealous Did you say jealous? Do you think I feel jealous about that crazy women... and the show you're putting on? I think... You... You're too happy Nothing to worry about So you're looking for something different Please, don't include me in it! Looking for Donghee? Not really... - He got hurt during a demonstration - What? He's in the hospital behind the school. He just checked in I see... Oh, Soeun! Do I look that bad? I don't know I had bad luck or I'm just not coordinated I'm the only one who fell Got a pen? Sign it. So it will get better quicker Got to go. I'll stop to see Sunmi on the way - Right! She's in here, too - Downstairs The president will be changed this month anyway Thank you. I hope you're right I inscribed my name on him Interesting, you mean like a tattoo? Sort of. It's weird to think I have my name on him I feel like I own him An arm is swinging with my name. He's walking, swinging me Sorry? It's similar to my parents' story That's what my Mom wrote when she met Dad Your Mom? Oh! My parents went to the same university as us Let me see... Entered the school in 1977 Why didn't I think of that? They're going to school with you! Oh my god! Who are they? I'd know them! My Mom's Sunmi Hur, and my Dad's name is Donghee Jee Do you know them? Of course. We've the same major... Do you know them well? Not really, just... You say your father's name was Donghee? Yes, you know him? They were a famous couple Yes, of course... Wow...I can't believe this! They look very good together Wow...how's my mother? What's her nickname? You... Is this a fad? Who is it? What the hell?! Visiting my friend Something wrong? Jesus! Are you drunk? What am I, an alcoholic? No, it can't be. It's all a lie How can he be in 2000? Does that make sense? I'm gonna turn that crook over to the police What an accident! Hur Sunmi - Are you sure that's true? - I'm positive! It can't be Hyunji. You sure it wasn't someone else? I thought I was dying. That's a very famous bar Are you sure it was Hyunji? Did you see her? - Not too close but... - You're full of it Her clothes and make up were exactly the same She must be in need of money Hi! Are we talking about Hyunji working at the bar? - You knew? - You guys didn't know? See? I told you She works there because she likes to drink You are very quiet today... It's one of those days Have you met my parents? They look so good together I wish everything looked so good How's your boy friend? I was thinking maybe... We're not destined to be with each other Not everything's destined for each other You say a destination before you leave, not when you get there Finally, I'm out! You scared me. Don't ever do that Soeun, what's wrong? Aren't you happy that I'm back? I'm all better I don't feel like fooling around Want some? Hello Going to my parents' country house To get something Have you been drinking? Stupid! Am I an alcoholic? When do you come back? Be careful OK It's a good luck charm, Soeun How do you feel? Can I keep this as a souvenir? Soeun? What brings you here? I just wanted to see you I heard you left school early So I was worried Don't worry. Everything's fine Wanna take a walk? Can you grab my arm? Can you do it? Do you have a boyfriend? If anybody sees us, they'll think we're lovers Are you here to say that? Sort of... If we are lovers, they'd know even if we're not holding hands People are in mourning for the death of President Park... who passed away at 7:50pm on the 26th House Representative Choi has taken over the Presidency... and the Defense Minister... Going to school? Honey? Honey! It's OK. There won't be a war or anything Everything will be fine Soeun! Soeun! Hi! Everything you said came true. Dictatorship will be over I'm sure you didn't foresee the future but everything you said became reality In! Did you find out? Hey, hold your horses... Did you find out? She is no longer here Passed away? Dead? Is she sick? She was transferred to Chonan University 2 years ago - What? - She is an English professor Was she ill? I saw her picture and she was beautiful She's still single No So she transferred voluntarily? Yes, we didn't want to let her go but she had personal reasons Same year I came to school If she were to choose my father... and married him, what would happen to me? Then... That can't happen Because the world is one we live in the dimension that is parallel to time There can't be another dimension with the same organism This can't be proven by science... What the hell am I saying? Anyway, I don't believe in any of this Your agony is an interesting S/F melodrama But I'm not really interested. That's it. No more! I don't believe in that machine either with or without electricity communicating with a woman from the past! What's this? Is this an alarm also? Yes This is Soeun I was searching for you but I couldn't connect Well... I travelled for a few days I'm sorry I broke up with him He wasn't right for me As you told me, I wanted to find out if he was my destination But I didn't think it was right So I let go of him from my heart And I walked for a long time Walked every corner of the school They say people live with a scent And they scatter the scent everywhere When the scent is gone, they die But some people still have the scent after death And some people pass on the scent to others Then it can spread everywhere I know his scent I'd recognize it with my eyes closed Him and I. We definitely live with the same emotion Same sorrow, same joy We'd keep the same scent and live forever The feeling that I have in 1979 I'm sure you will be able to feel it in 2000 You think it's right after all these years? I just want to say I'm sorry If not, just want to see her face. See if she's all right I wish she'd look happy If she looks sad or depressed, what am I going to do? I couldn't stand it In! Go! Thanks - Professor Yoon here? - She's in class. Room 1 Soeun. I saw you today You looked so beautiful and happy You seemed to be doing well When you pass me by... I could feel your scent you talked about I don't think it's working anymore This radio... It's a bad thing! Hey, hey... What are you doing this late? You guys again? Nothing... Fixing something... Is that the way to fix it? Trying to destroy it? Won't be easy Go home. That's how time passes No one will believe what we've been through for the last several months. Right He's right. That's how time passes There's nothing we can do to change what is meant to be You want to grab my arm? Why all of a sudden? - Do it! - You're embarrassing me
