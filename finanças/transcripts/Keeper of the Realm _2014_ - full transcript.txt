Make way, make way! Excuse me, excuse me. Out of the way. We need air. He's not responding. Don't die on me. Back off, lady, behind me. - I got nothing, I got nothing. - Come on, breathe! Come on, breathe! Come on, breathe! Come on. [Coughing] [Alfonso] Take him inside. Some help here? Get him some water! [Water splashes] Take this. - No. - Take it. No. Don't worry. Take it. What are you doing, man? We are running on empty just in case you forgot? You take it. Thanks, but... it's our job. There's no need. Thank you. Here you are, sir. Home sweet home. What's wrong? Nothing. Why? I didn't hear you bitching all the way up here, it was so unlike you. Right, man... are you sick or something? Haha, very funny, assholes. Where am I seeing you tomorrow? Today is Tuesday, no? No dumb-ass, Thursday. Today is Lucy's. No. No mothers. We can't go there. The husband is back. Let's try Vicky. Okay, so see you at Vicky's. Hey, say hi to the kids for me. [Sound from television] [Door opens] - What's up, babe? - Nothing. What are you watching? There's nothing on. Wow, you made cochinita. Yummy! Hands off. It's for tomorrow. It's for tomorrow, I said. What do you want me to do? Starve? Didn't you eat anything? What were you doing? Same old, same old. A kid fell into a well. It was a mess. And how is he? Fine. He made it. Did you get paid? They asked me to go by some other day... What? What did you expect me to do? Leave the kid down in the well? I don't know, Carlos. Tell them you can't eat air. If they don't like it, they can rescue him themselves. Rosario, they've got nothing. Kids don't even have shoes. - You can't expect... - What about your girls? They need shoes too. It's nice of you to worry about other people's kids. When will you worry about your own? Stop it, rosario. - The girls will hear you. - They're not here. I left them with my mom. Look, you know how this is. Sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't. I'll probably get another gig tomorrow. No more tomorrows, Carlos. It's always the same with you I'm tired of living off loans. - We'd better leave it at that. - What is this? Do you want a divorce? Don't be ridiculous, Carlos. You know we can't afford a lawyer. [Cumbia music] Here you go. Giovanna, honey! This table needs service. Everything all right? If there's anything you need... What's up, you guys? Your girlfriends don't feed you? What girlfriends? You're the only one for us. Yeah, right. Cheeky bastard. You'd better have some money on you. We always pay, Vicky. Only when it suits you. You still owe me two dinners. You just say the word. I just ate, Vicky. What if I cramp up or something? Tough, papi. It's either that or doing the dishes. You heard the lady, man. If you want bread, you have to sweat. I really got to hit the sack, but you know what? Tomorrow is on me. [Phone ringing] Hello? Yes? Where? Okay, we're on our way. Hey man, what's up? You were sleeping over there, so I just took a nap. Who was that? Some girl from las margaritas, it sounds urgent. We'd better get our asses moving. It's a three-hour drive from here. [Whistle] - What? - Adolfo, we gotta bounce. I hope it's not another cow, dude. I fucking hate them. They shit all over you when you push them out. I think you're right. [Knife sharpening] [Adolfo] It's her? Please George, tell me she needs to be helped. [George] Take it easy, dude. You called us? Yes, it's right up ahead. I'll guide you. Why can't every call be like this, man? A few days ago, some gringos came asking for a guide. They hired my brother. But I haven't heard from him in two weeks. I came looking for him and found this. What else? Nothing. They got lost... I guess. What did the cops say? I called you first. What did she just say? What's your name, honey? - Itzel. - Look, Itzel. I'm gonna tell you how it works. When somebody goes missing, you call the cops. If people are stuck, they call us. We're a rescue team, not detectives. - Let's get the hell out of here, guys. - Sorry, I didn't know. Take it easy, Charlie, she's just trying to help, okay? Yeah, who's gonna pay for the gas and the time that it took us to get here? We're here, jerk. We can take a look, no? A look at what? We don't even know where they went. There's a cave like half an hour from here, it's the only place I can think of. - You speak English? - I'm Mayan, not stupid. How big do you think it is? I think it will take, to go in and out, at least 6 or 8 hours. - [George] Can you draw us a map? - Oh, fuck me! I can do something better. I'll go with you. Look, it's gonna take 12 hours to get there, and that's if no one's hurt. It's gonna be dark by the time we get out. I have no problems sleeping in there. We should call it, man. We didn't come prepared for this kind of shit, okay? - We didn't even bring food. - We're already here, okay? If we don't find them we get back out in the morning, then it's the cops' problem, what do you say? You know what, I swear to god, if we find these fuckers and they don't pay us, I'm going to leave them there. I don't give a shit if their fucking legs are broken, okay? - Are you serious? - Yes, I am serious. If I were in this same situation in your country, they would rip me the fuck off to save my ass, okay? Why can't we do the same? [Itzel] I don't think money is an issue. I saw these people paying with big rolls of cash. Okay, fine, we do it your way this time, okay? You lead the way. It's this way. This better be worth it, George. What did I miss, man? Last night I found him sleeping in the Jeep. Shit... So she really did it then? She kicked him out, okay? Just act like if nothing happened, okay? If he hasn't told us, it's for a reason. [George] Hey! [Music] - It's some kind of temple? - Yeah. The elders thought this was the entrance to xibalba. We should knock first. We come in peace. We're not here to destroy or plunder. We're here to learn, so we can pass on what we've learned. We have to leave something of value. I don't have anything. - Your knife. - My knife? It's going to be here when we come out. Nobody comes. Ladies first. Are we there yet? [Itzel] We're almost there! [Carlos] Don't start, man. [Adolfo] What time is it? It's 6:25, jerk. Shut up already. Shit. [Rumbling noise] Okay, great. Now how do we know where the hell they went? Here's the plan. Why don't you guys check the tunnels on the left, and Itzel and I the ones on the right. Yeah, really smooth, asshole. The air is not stagnant in this one. Maybe they went through here. [Itzel] No. It's this way. [George] How can you be sure? [Itzel] I'm pretty sure the Mayans didn't have spray paint. [George] You have to be an idiot to get lost. I don't know, guys. Gotta be careful, I don't like this, we gotta watch our steps. Yes. The rocks are a little loose here, so we have to go one at a time. Don't even think about it, man. I saw her first. [George] Clear. You want to go first? - What? - You want to go first? Sure. Listen, bro, you can keep whatever it pays, okay? She'll take you back. All right? [Itzel] It's the last one. It's this way. - Is this the last one? - Here it is. It's here. No, no. It's south. South's that way. It's this way, I remember. If the sun comes out there, it means south is that way. It's the last one. Otherwise we'll go around in circles. Is it gold? No, it's a bullet. Hey look, there's more there. [Carlos] No, wait! Adolfo! Hold on, man! Adolfo! I say we go back and ask for help, man. We can't leave her here. - But they have guns. - Shh! Shut the fuck up, you're going to get us all killed! - Be careful. - Wait here. [Coughing] I thought you'd abandoned me. Don't say that. I brought help, like I promised. What about the others? Where are they? Out there. You didn't tell them anything, did you? Easy, calm down. Relax, relax. [Cutting neck] Itzel? Itzel? I'm sorry. We need to leave. There could be more of these guys around. Everyone's dead. It's not your fault. You did everything that you could. [Carlos] George! In here! - Is he dead? - Yeah. We need to call it in. These guys brought a lot of gear. See if you can find a radio. I don't think we should touch anything. I don't know about you guys, but I don't wanna spend my day dragging dead corpses around, man. - It's her brother. - He's who we came for. Is there anything I can do? Hey, a winch! It's broken. What's that? It's a fag detector. Works like a charm. Hey, we got titanium connectors, mobile arresters. This gear is from an oil platform or the army. Why would they bring it here? They got a radio, but it's useless, man. Why don't you check their packs? - What packs? - Those guys'. Why is it always me who was to check the dead guys? Because your breath stinks like them. Go check 'em. Fuck me. Holy shit, there's more here, man! Oh my god! Do you know how much this is worth? This, you bastard! Look no further! This, you bastard! Merry fucking Christmas! You knew about this. Somebody in your village must have spoken about this. No one ever comes to this place. Everybody thinks the devil lives here. The devil! They were wrong, this is heaven! So your brother came here, and they knew exactly where to look. Yes. And they killed him. [Thunder] What are you doing? - Nothing. - Give them back. My brother had a family. Who's gonna take care of them now that he's gone? Yeah, let her take it. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. She's right, man. Finders keepers. Those guys didn't die of the flu, it's obvious somebody came after them. Yeah? Then why is everything still here, eh? - We should call it in. - Oh come on, George. You know very well that when the cops get here they'll want to keep everything for themselves. Yeah, and the rest will end up in the living room of some fuckin' politician, no? Obviously. You know what's going to happen if we get caught with all this shit? Why is it that every time something good happens to us, you have to make us feel bad about it, man? This is like winning the fucking lottery, okay? And I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna pass on the opportunity because I have a family. Don't listen to him. Grab anything you want. We could fix the Jeep, man. Fuck fixing that piece of shit! We can get a fucking helicopter, man! Dude, here it doesn't make any good to anyone. No one. Does anyone else know you were coming here? Not a soul. Let's just go, man. Just fucking go. Do you think it will work? It had better. Hold this like I told you. What's wrong with him? Who? George? - What about him? - Nothing. Just wondering... Who finds a treasure... - and refuses to keep it? - That's him. He thinks he's captain america. [Laughs] How so? Used to be a soldier. Don't know what war he fought in, but... He's always trying to save the world and all that shit. - Really? - Yeah. And what is he doing here? Who knows? He never talks much about himself. Must be a deserter. Let's try it now. Connect it. Careful. I think we should just burn them, man. Human fat makes black smoke. Somebody can spot us from miles away. I know that, but I don't wanna smell like these poor bastards all year. We have to cover our asses. If we're doing this, we're doing it right. You've done this before, haven't you? Grab his legs. Ready? One... two... What do you think? I think he's about to close the deal. I mean her. [Grunts] What about her? One, two, three... She seems way too cool for someone who's just lost her brother. Yeah, well... I guess everybody deals with death in their own way, right? Yeah, maybe you're right. Come on. One... two... three. [Winch winding up] Enough. Do you think it'll work? Those cables look too thin. It's fine. - You mean that's it? - Yeah. [Adolfo] All done! [Whisltes] - Gotta get it... get it over. - Come on, man. You have to push it from this side. Son of a bitch! - Hold it, hold it! - [Itzel] What is it? It's stuck. Adolfo, what happened? It got stuck, man! - Need any help? - Nah, I can do it. I'm coming down! Watch it, man! Easy does it. Motherfucker's stuck! Fuck! Hit it again! [Rope stretching] I'm putting all my weight on it. Come on! One! Two! Three! Last try! I'll put all my weight! One! Two! Three! That's it! Man, I told you. Easy does it. Coming! - Oh, shit! - Adolfo! Shit. [Muffled] Adolfo! Can you hear me? [Normal] Adolfo. Adolfo, look at me. Can you move? - [Screaming in pain] - Easy, easy. Hold on, Adolfo. Look at me, look at me. Get him up. He's dislocated his arm. - You gotta be kidding me. - Hold on, hold on. You have to sit him. He's gonna fix your arm, okay? Hold on, hold on. Come, come. Trust me. Give me your arm. At the count of three! No! Count to five, please. Count to five, please. Okay. At the count of five. Ready. One! [Bones cracking] Motherfucker! You said five, asshole! What the fuck happened up there? The bitch tried to kill me, man! She almost cut my head off. Where is she? She didn't come down yet. She must still be up there. Asshole! - Hey, Adolfo. - What? Can you fix the winch, man? George, we need to get out of here before she calls her people in, man. That won't be necessary. [George] She's still breathing. Get some branches, we need a stretcher. [Bones cracking] Why are you helping her, man? Because that's our job. We rescue people, remember? George, I don't know if you were here, but she tried to kill Adolfo, remember? You can't just leave behind the ones you don't like. Well, whatever, man. I'm not going to jail for that bitch. Fuck, George. He's right. We can't trust her, man. I don't like it either, but she deserves it, man. Okay, fine. She deserves to die. Here. It's your chance. That's not what I meant. Oh, I get it. You want her to agonize for two to three days, and then she can die like the bitch that she is, right? What about you? Take it. Yeah, it's just what I thought. It's getting dark. We should make camp and figure out what to do. [George] Come on Adolfo, push! One more, one more, one more. Come on! One more! Get it, you bastard! One more, one more. One, two, three! [Straining] Okay, no more. Fuck! Okay come on, let's reset. The girl. Adolfo, where are you going, man? I hope you know how much time we are wasting with this? It's our job. Our fucking job. You want to help me reset over there? Oh no, that is your job. My job is not to carry a bitch around. That's definitively not my fucking job. Asshole. It's going! Don't let go, all right? Don't even think about letting go! - Stop, stop! - Okay, okay. Oh, man. Oh, fuck. My back is killing me, man. Her fever's dropping. Yeah, that's fucking awesome. It's our last one. I hope she's fucking worth it, man. Gimme some water, man. We'd better keep going, there's still a long way to go. [Gunshot] - What was that? - Shut the fuck up. - Why are they not leaving, man? - I don't know. Let's go. What do we do now? We have no choice but to wait. You two rest up. I'll do the first watch. [Rumbling noise] Did you hear that? [Heart beating] [Itzel screaming] Fuck! [Itzel] Help me! Please! Here! Help! Please! Help! [Grunting] Shut up! - Help! - Shut up! [Itzelscreaming] She wouldn't shut up. Hey, George! They still there? No. They left. How can you be so sure? I am not. So what now? We'll have to take a detour. I don't want to risk finding myself face to face with these guys. But we don't know what's in that direction. What about her? We are going to have to Bury her. I told you I'd heard screaming. Hey, you guys! 'Morning. 'Morning. We heard the girl screaming. - She dead? - No, no. She fell, broke her legs. Poor girl. Yeah. What are you doing here? Hunting, got lost. How did you get here? Through a cave, back there. What were they hunting in the caves? Bats? What's the gringo saying? Nothing. He just asked what were you hunting? A Jaguar, gringo. Been tracking that cat for days. But there's no fucking prey around. You hungry? Yeah. We can take a bite. Yeah, sure. Here. What's this? Good luck with the hunt. We can help you if you want. No need. You must be tired. It's the least we can do to pay for the food. No, I mean it. There's no need. This is a dangerous place, full of ruins, so there are always looters and thieves around. We can take care of ourselves, my friend. But if you're stealing something... Of course not. What's that, then? Camping gear. Look, man. We're not here to judge anyone. We're here to help. You just give us our cut. We're not greedy. It's not that, I said. It's just camping stuff. Just listen to him. So, we can take a look. Let them. I don't think that's a good idea, George. You want to see? Come, look. It's the Jaguar! Motherfucker! - You kill them. - What the fuck, George? He was a thief. He would have killed us and stolen the statue. Fuck, George, we are in big trouble now, man. Nothing's gonna happen, ok? Look around you, man! We are gonna be canned for fucking life! Nobody is going to jail! Ok. You were right. I shouldn't have brought her along with us. That was my fault and it won't happen again. But you got to realize that anyone we meet is gonna want to take it from us. You gotta understand that. Right? We are gonna have to move fast. Somebody could have heard the gunshot. Do we Bury them or what? Just let the vultures do their work. But take the machetes... they can come in handy if we meet somebody else. You have to show me some moves. You can kiss his ass later. Get to work! - Ok, got it? - Yeah. Ready? One, two, pull! [Grunting] - Ok. You got it? - Yeah. One. Two. Pull! [Grunting] Ok. Ok. I think we made it! - There it is! - Let's go! [George] You see the freeway? You gotta be kidding me. Must be a joke. Where the fuck are we, man? Gotta be kidding me. [Carlos] We must have taken the wrong turn. [George] It's impossible! The closest desert is 600 miles away, man! Maybe it's the beach, man. Why do you always have to come up with something stupid? I don't think we crossed half the fucking country... The only thing I can think of is that's the sea. Then, where is the water, you idiot? Don't start! It doesn't matter where we are, we are lost. Adolfo, how much food do we have? Not much. We can save that for tomorrow. What about today, George? Today! The forest will provide. I have not seen a fucking lizard or a bird in days, man! We followed your plan, and this is where we are. You know what? Why don't you enlighten us with your next great idea? We can go a couple of days without food, man. Let's get the fuck out of here. [Carlos laughing] What is so fuckin' funny? Really? Because I think it's fucking hilarious, man. We have a fucking statue that's worth millions, and I would trade it right now for one fucking taco! And a big coke and a huge burger. And a milkshake with choco-chips... Can you shut the fuck up? And stop torturing yourselves. [Carlos] Shit. This is the best fucking tuna I've ever tasted. We better keep moving. You pull from there. Nothing. What if she was right? Right about what? That this is actually hell. We are too tired, that's all. We've been dragging that thing for days and we've barely sleep. We should just rest for a while and keep going when we recover our strength. Who's keeping watch? [Apple hits the ground] Guys, did you hear that? - Fuck! - What the fuck, man? [Laughing] [Adolfo] There's more here! [Carlos] Shit! [Adolfo] See this, man? I told you so! It smells like a dead rat! They're all rotten. How can you eat that shit? I've had worse. Don't even think about it. Shit! What's wrong with him? Get him up! His pupils are dilated. - Grab a belt. - Hold his hands down. [George screams] George, what's wrong? George, look at me! [George screams] Do we go looking for him, or what? No, man. He could be anywhere. I don't see any tracks. What do we do? What we did when we got lost as kids. We just wait for him to come back. What if something happened to him? He can take care of himself. Fuck! Get that over here, will you? It's getting cold. It's because we haven't eaten anything. - We should move. - No. I think we should wait for him here. If he's not back by tomorrow, then we leave. Let him catch up. Cover me up, man. It's getting pretty cold, man. Are you stupid? Why did you uncover it? It was fucking freezing; Didn't you feel that? Where the hell were you, anyway? I found a way to get out of here. Oh man, I can hardly stand on my feet, George. I don't think I can carry that thing anymore. So eat, then. You want to fuckin' poison us or something? Do I look sick or poisoned? I don't feel hungry anymore. In fact, I feel like new. You in the other hand look like shit. What is this way out? I found a river. We could build a raft. That way we wouldn't have to drag the statue anymore; The river would do it for us. George, it's too heavy. We would sink. Not if we make it right. I think the best idea, man... is just to Bury this thing, and come back for it later. Look, asshole. Stop second-guessing everything that I say. It's really easy. If we don't work, we don't get out. Now, Adolfo is gonna be cutting trees. Am I right? I'm gonna be building a raft. What are you doing? I'm gonna cut the trees too, man. Just relax. Eat fast. [Wood creaking] - There, there. - Done. - Turn, turn. - Hold on! [Adolfo] How do you do it, man? I've a couple of big glands you don't called balls. Where did he go? I think he went down to the river. [Laughing] Well, he can go anytime he wants. [Laughing] What's so funny? I don't think you'd understand, George. - Try me. - [Laughing] Okay. Where are you going? To the river. [Laughing] You see? It just can't be translated. Whatever. See? Told you he was in a hurry to go down to the river. Fuck! Adolfo! Adolfo! Get up! - Where are the machetes? - You had them, didn't you? No. I left them there before we went to sleep. Didn't we leave them where we were working? No, man. I already checked. Lift your fucking feet. Shit! Hey George, have you seen the machetes? No. How are we going to cut the fucking trees? Pull, pull! Once more. One, two, three. All right, man. - Pull man! - Pull! You gotta be kidding me. Fuck it. You guys are too slow. You are gonna have to work at night. Since when did you become the boss? Since it became clear that you two are good for nothing. Well, it's easy for you because you have tools. It's not my problem that you lost yours. We could go a lot faster with your knife. I'll tell you that. I am using it. Yeah? You know what, George? Fuck you. You bring down the fucking trees. I don't give a shit anymore. Watch it! Watch it, man! You don't need tools! You need brains! I wanna hear you working! Son of a bitch! - This fucking jungle... - Where are you going? George's gonna be pissed. It's so fucking stupid to cut down trees with rocks! Why are you not working? Holy shit, man! You almost give me a heart attack, man. Don't do that. What are you doing? I just came here to get some ropes. You don't need them. Well, it's stupid to bring the trees down like that, man. Come on. I know what you are trying to do. Talking behind my back in Spanish so I don't understand. It was a fucking joke. I'm not stupid, Carlos. I know you want to keep her for yourself. Her? What the fuck is wrong with you? You better get back to work. I recommend you stop sneaking around. I could get confused and do something we both would regret. Ok, all right... all right. Break time is over. Get some logs. - But... - Hold on. - We have to get out of here. - He'll hear you, man. He's paranoid. He hasn't slept in days. I know, we are fucked. What do you think will happen when the raft is finished and he doesn't need us anymore? You're not saying we fight him, are you? No, man. Let's take the raft. We'll come back for him later. And leave everything? Take whatever you can carry in your pockets. I don't give a shit anymore. I just wanna see my girls. - You wanna make a run for it? - No, no. You just pretend to be working while I drag the raft down to the river. - I'll whistle, all right? - All right. - Hurry up, man. - All right. We're getting the hell outta here. [Grunting] [Rock hitting wood] [Whistle in distance] [Whistle in distance] [Whistle in distance] [Whistle] Adolfo! What are you doing? I'm just arranging everything to carry it more easily, man. Where the fuck are they? I don't have them, man! I swear! - You want to fuck me over! - I don't have them! Where the fuck is it? I don't know man. I swear. I don't have it! You either shit or hurl right now, or I'll slice you up like a fucking cow! Adolfo! No, George! Adolfo! [Screaming] Where are they? Where the fuck are they? Where is it? Where is it? Where are they? You... [Grunts in pain] You'll never take it out by yourself. We'll see. Come on, fucking bitch! Come on! Son of a bitch, come on! [George straining] Oh god... We're gonna have to work together if you want to get out of here. That's it? Is that all you have to say? You killed your best friend, and that's all you have to say? He forced my hand. If you haven't hadn't betrayed me, Adolfo would still be here. What went wrong? What do you mean? Well it's obvious something went wrong, if you are still here. I found the raft shattered in pieces. The river's too rocky. So I suppose you want us to go into the river with a half a ton statue. I'm sure the two of us will be able to keep it away from the rocks. And then what? Further down the river widens and the current has to calm down. Wake me up when you are ready to go. What? It's a lot of work, George. You better get going if you want us to get out this year. You think I'm doing all the work alone? I don't think I need to remind you that you stab me in the fucking back, asshole. I need to regain my strength for the river. You won't want me to have a relapse, would you? Wake me up when you are ready to go. It's going to take forever to take that thing down by yourself, you know that? I don't think I asked for your opinion, did I? Come on, man. Untie this, and I hold this thing down. - I thought you didn't care. - I changed my mind. Sometime today would be nice. Come on. Let's see what you can do... With that arm of yours. All right. - Ready? - Ready. Easy, easy, easy. Come on, a little more, a little more. A little more, a little more, a little more. Let it down. Come on! I got it, I got it. Bring it down. [Grunting] Come on! [Grunts] A little more, man. I got it. I got it. Oh, shit! Fuck it! Now you just have to load the rest. Fucking asshole. You want to get the other end to help drag it out, here's an oar. I'm going to push it out. I don't think that's gonna work for me, man. What are you talking about? I'll be happy to pull if you give me your knife. Do you want to move your ass so I can do it? - Asshole. - For god's sake. All right. Ready? Come on. I don't see it, man. This is impossible. Maybe the river grows, George. It should be here. [River's flow intensifies] Here they come! Come on! Here they come! Hold it steady. Watch your side! Your side more! Come on! We made it! - Yeah! - We made it! [Laughing] That's a waterfall, man! - Fucking row! - Shit. Holy shit! We have to get rid of shit! Get rid of weight! Get rid of weight! George! George! I thought you said the fucking river widens. That's a fucking waterfall! I saved your fucking ass! You are gonna grab the rope and we are going to go straight through that forest, and we are gonna take it back to where needs to go. No, man. I'm done. I'm done with that shit! You are done when I say you are fucking done! Can't you see what this is doing to us? Can't you see that's a fucking curse? Fuck this thing. It's cursed! Fuck back, you ass! You are one selfish motherfucker! If you don't want to do it for you, do it for your fucking family! It's not worth it, George. It's not worth it. Not for you. Say hi to the kids from me. [Grunting] [Carlos coughs] Thank you. Here. Take it. Thank you. [Car pulling away] [Music]
