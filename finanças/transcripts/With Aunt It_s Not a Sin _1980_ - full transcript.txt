With Aunt It's Not a Sin Gloria? Gloria! We are here! - You look good, you haven't changed at all. - That's what you say. - Is he Rosario? - Come on, what are you waiting for? Say hello to your aunt. - Good morning, madam. But come here! You know we are aunt and nephew? Or have you forgotten? - Come on, come on, take your aunt's bags. - Immediately. How beautiful it is! I hadn't seen it for years a sun like that. Truly wonderful! But why didn't you warn me? You could call me or send me a telegram. You know, I was working until the last moment... ...and that dumb boss gave me permission only yesterday... "otherwise I warned you first. - Do I disturb you? Do I create any problems for you? - We are so happy to see you. - And the notary? - Then we'll see. You, rather... It's from your marriage that we don't see each other. How's it going down there? Good morning, ma'am. Miss... - Good morning. - Good morning to you. Hi, Saro. - Who is that? - The pharmacist. - You know what I want to do with the money we take - No. I want to have Giacomo put in next to his brother. Once he told me: "When I die. I want to be buried by the... ". Then I, at a certain point, I took the primary and "threw it down hard". "Dear Professor, not to interfere, but..." "...either inside me or the nun outside." And that, a dirty old man, he looked at me carefully... Well, now all over New Jersey and beyond there is not a psychopath who is not dependent on me. - And the nun? - "Air"! She went foil in Africa. The foil! - Oh, my God, how late it is! - Come on, let's fix it. Leave, I'll do it in the morning. So, you sleep in my room and I will with Saro. But are you crazy? There is no change here or I'll go to the hotel. - Are we not sister-in-law? - If it doesn't bother you, whatever you want. - This is for you. - Thank you, aunt, it's beautiful. That's exactly what I was looking for. Look - Goodnight Mom. - Good night. - Good night, aunt. - Good night, Saro. Are you talking to the teacher tomorrow? There is a test in class and I would not like... - Do not worry. Good night. - Good night. - But why did you want to disturb yourself so much? - You will understand! And then enough with the compliments. There is a little thought for you too, a little thing. - Did you win the lottery? - You will like this. But what is it? A costume? It's very beautiful. Thank you, but they don't accept it here the idea of the teacher "in two pieces". - Besides, I don't think it suits me. - My God, still at this point? - But the liberation of the woman? - Here you always die from an abortion attempt. A young and beautiful woman like you who can't put on a bikini... ...which then is already "the grandmother's two-piece"! You speak well, unfortunately with us it is not like in the city. Here always have eyes on you, most of all. - But did you know my father? - He was a lovely man. Not being able to marry him, I had to marry his brother. - Did he like America? - With feet he was there, but his soul was always in Italy. People called him "mafia". And he would say, "Damn bastards." "Foams of the European homelands". A few punches, but overall he had settled in quite well. You see, from the rock to the bay once it all belonged to our family. - Oh yes? - Yes. Except they're so earthy on the shore to the sea that does not grow an accident. In the village they call it "the fish walk". And over there, in the middle of the beach, there is the property. On the left side. Papa never wanted to build anything on it. That is the marina. Look. There is the old lighthouse and over there should pass the aqueduct... ...mafia and municipal surveyor permitting. From here it goes up the ridge and borders with the edge of reeds down there to the sea. - That's roughly 30 hectares. - Not bad! - Hold on tight. - Okay. Come on, come on. The state property begins there. Papa let himself be given the concession for 100 years. It's a family vice, we always hope in Providence. - Be careful! - Are there snakes? - Not here, they are all in town. Do you take a bath? It's incredibly hot! - But, aunt, you don't have a costume, they could see you. - So? See how it's done. Come on, don't stand there! Come on, Saro! "Come on, dear"! Oh nice! Wonderful! Ah, how cold it is! - And without sharks! - Other than the ocean! - Saro? Saro! - Yes, aunt? - Do you smoke? - No thanks. Mom doesn't allowed me, she says it's not good. Listen, aunt, why you never came to find us? Why didn't you want to sell? "Who sells goes down"... For those "little money" they offered us... But sometimes even those are handy. You see, Saro, such a beautiful place it cannot have a price. Think of the thousand natural combinations who helped to form it. However it is decided, we sell. You're happy? - But who is buying? - They say there both behind De Vito, the municipal surveyor. What for 20 years pretends to design the aqueduct... ...and meanwhile he sells us mineral water weighing gold. Whenever summer comes... a small increase. And the surveyor is good... - It can not be. - It's the truth. I assure you. Good morning. Mr. Mayor. - Good morning. Eh... Nice cuckold too, huh? Ah, here's another one passing by. - Very expensive! - Golden bachelors! - Hello! - Judge. - I'll go to the pharmacy later. - Dearest lady... - Fuck, with that "of horns has a wagon"! - Doctor. - Mrs. - Engineer. - Good walk. - Thanks. She has fun. Good this one, huh? Now I'll tell you! - The husband went out the other night... - So? - Crazy things. "Enough", she screamed! But I am been like a deaf animal! Well, she didn't confess to me, crying, that with her husband ... never. - But go! They have 8 children! - Never! - Mah! - I never tell you. Other than none of them looks like his father. In short, physical carnal pleasure... what she had never experienced. Do I understand? - Hey! Calogero, what ts it? - Come on, come on! Quick, let's go! - Arrival. - Mrs. Antonia, good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Mr. Calogero, this is Gloria Lamborghini, my sister-in-law. - Pleasure. - Permit? The engineer Antonio De Vito. - Palmachiara Urzi. - Hello, Saruzzo. - Say hello, Saro! - Good morning. Good morning. We can have the honor of accompanying you to take a walk together? Thanks, gladly. We were going to mass. - So, Saruzzo, how is school going? How are you? - Very well. - Have you ever been to Etna? - No, why? It's like us Sicilians: outside the snow, inside the incandescent magma. However! - It will be a lot. - It depends. - From? - From her. - From me?! Yes, because, surveyor, those "four sous" that he offered for the Lamborghini property... - You are welcome? - My sister-in-law Antonia... I too am an heir. But it is agricultural land, uncultivated for 100 years. Just a little water. She knows how things are today, nobody wants to stay in the countryside. - I'm taking it for my poor mom. - Sole director of the company. Which, then, will present a project of subdivision... just happens to her. - "Bottana da 'miseria"! - As? - Nothing, bullshit! Excuse me, I meant nonsense. Hey, I'm not the pharmacist! - You like? - To me yes. But the carabinieri, the praetor, they are difficult people. - I'm not going to tell you the ones from the town. - Rite Indian, huh? Buried alive with her husband. Don't you shave? He likes it that way. - Come here, come on. Where are the earwigs? - But, really... There. Stretch out for a moment that we "operate". - By the way... Mm? - Oh, no. Never since then. Done. And then next year you go topless. May be! - L'hai visto ? - Mm-mm. Mica male questo Calogero. Di che segno ? ? - Did he ask you for dime? - No, there was too much people, but she understood why I went. He's very unpleasant to Saro, huh? No, it's just that he can't stand it the idea of another next to me. - Maybe when he's older... - You'll be older. - Well... maybe. - Maybe a horn! - Have you ever thought about getting married again? - Think?! You mean to come back to live together permanently... ...with one of those ugly furry monkeys with that slippery thing between your legs... ...you say to him: "Uh, how small he is!", immediately runs to the psychiatrist? I say that you have really gone mad! - Good morning. - Good morning. engineer, no planning today? - "Savage aqueduct"! - Mm... - The usual, engineer? - Yes, the usual. Good. So, "Playman", "The Hours"... Oh, softly. Shut up, these are delicate things. How should I tell you? - "Playboy"! - Speak softly, delicate the situation, huh? Eh, she wow. - Here you go, engineer. - Okay. - So, "bradigi" manual do you have any? - "Bradigi"?! "Bradigi, Bradigi". That bullshit that the continentals play. A kind of game between Briscola and the Tressette for the rich. - Ah, Bridge, you meant, engineer! - Why, what did I say? Then. Bridge... Bridge... - Here: Bridge. - Found? - Yes. - Here, engineer. It arrived just yesterday. - Oh, just yesterday? - It's the latest edition. "Good Better Soon". Very well. - I'll put them on the representative's account Common? - When it is, you will have free water. This is the fourth time you bring it to me. You have to take the medicines. You understand it? - You don't have to sell them, do you understand? - I get it. If not one of these days... - No offense, doctor. - Go, go! Go. Good morning. - A raincoat". - One thousand. - And never come back. - Thanks. - A "salvaminchia". - One thousand. - Good morning, doctor. - Hi, Toto, what's up? - Eh, something urgent. - You got red again, huh? - No... - Look at me American medicines this time I have not. - No, we have to play Bridge. - Bridge? We? But you've never played it. - In fact, you will teach me this morning. It takes years. I need to see Antonia. - Carmela. Carmela! - Tell me, doctor. - I have something very urgent to do. replace with me - But I don't know the medicines. - Three "tricks and tracks". - 3000. Thanks. - You are welcome. Don't worry, Carmela. Until the mutual fund passes the condoms, there will be no problems. Have faith. - Say hello, Donna Carmela. - Good morning. Five "lightning rods". - Health! - It's for dad and mom. Because if I'm not an only child, I have to share the property. - But then you share the beds, right? - Already done, but they continue on the ground. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Step. - A flowers. - A hearts. - Contre. Four without. Step. Five paintings. Contre. Five spades. Contre. How is your son? Still bad? He's a bit exhausted, I left him at home. Ah, these guys are always tired. Do you remember our times? Always at home with mum... and never tired. It would take "a strong hand". - "Mazz and Panell 'make beautiful children. Panell's senza mazz... - They make the children crazy. But what a "mazz and panell" 'and other stupid things. But let him live, he's only 14. - Excuse me, ma'am, but do you have children? - No, I'm careful. Oh, my Madonna, Alfredo! A misfortune has happened! Good evening to these beautiful ladies! - No misfortune. I finished the tour first and I went to greet you. - Thank god. - Disorder, perhaps? - No, on the contrary, we are pleased. - Thanks, it's very kind of you. - You scared me, you know? - Do not worry. Ah! What a beautiful company! - Come on, sit down! - What loving husbands. Eh, you do what you can. No, I had to ask you a health opinion. - Ah! - Oh yes? Tell me tell me. - Is cholera "broken out"? - Mm! No, never in winter. I just saw her car and then I thought of a misfortune. You too? "Mizzica", what a beautiful combination! We hadn't even made an appointment... - Good morning. - Advice Municipal meets here now. - Good morning, gentlemen, good morning. - Look, they looked for you first. - Huh? Deaf! They looked foryou first! - Good morning. "Good Morning". - Good morning, beautiful ladies! - Gentlemen, good morning. - Hello. - Good Morning". - Dear friend. - Very expensive... Ah, Calogero! Calogero Pharmacist! Have the licorice tablets arrived? Alfredo. I've told you a thousand times that mine is not a grocery store. Gentlemen, let us finish the game. Rather, why don't you take a table too? - Sounds like a good idea. Shall we play Briscola? - Yes. With a Tressette for revenge. Calogero, would you like to play Briscola? I'm sorry, Toto, but I only play Bridge... Bridge? Bridge. Bridge... A trip to Reggio Calabria is enough and immediately feel continental. But go... You don't even know how to play bocce. They feel talk about Bridge and become masters.. So, you all agree for the Trump? - Since the ladies like it. - Okay, forget it, what do you want to do? - Let's play Bridge. But where "casserole" will they put it to me? - Who is it? - It's me, aunt. - Good morning. - Hello! - Today "there is a shift in fits and starts?. - Do you know where my suitcase is? - It's in the loft. I'll take it right away. Ok. - It's up there. - No, thanks, I'll go. You hold the ladder for me. Careful, it's partly stuck. Here it is. If I weren't back, I would not have known how. Come on, let me pass. Sorry, aunt. Mm! Good! In New York we always go to the Vermicello d'Oro. Shit... - Antonia! - Mrs. Lamborghini! Saro! - Good evening, lady. - Good evening, good evening. - Hi, Antonia. - Tonight there is the opening of the Johnny Club? - We want to become worldly! - We're going to stick "in the mouth of the whale." - That is not the mouth! What balls! We were actually having dinner! How much time do you give us? Is half an hour enough to make you beautiful? Half an hour is enough, huh? What a "pizza" that there. Saro, dress well because we bring you too. Okay thanks. Coming soon. - Good evening ladies. - Let's kiss your hands. - Walk, deaf. - Good evening, good evening. Here we go. Have you seen who is there? - Mm! - Well, now that he's on hold divorce... - What does that mean? - First she is regularized, and then you come to a public place. - Of course. I can have the honor of this dance with her? - No, thanks, it's too dangerous to dance with her. I learned certain things... - Wow! - I hope not political things. - Policies! - May I still have the honor... - I'm sorry, but this dance is reserved for my nephew. - He is right. - It can't be done. - Poor star, all alone... - But aunt, I the smooth... - Let's go up. - Of course. So you can no longer go on. I love you... ...but everything, I mean everything, has a limit. Please, let's not ruin the evening. Look, we can't continue anymore to talk to each other like this, "in bites and bites". Do as you please, organize, but tomorrow we have to stay together. No! No ?! So do you know what I do? Tomorrow I sell the pharmacy to the Municipality. and I'm off to go around the cousins. - No, the tour of the cousins no! - Yes but! America, north and south... ...Canada, France, Germany, Guatemala, Johannesburg, Australia... I'll be back in 20 years, like Ulysses. You won't see me again, understand? Absolutely more! Antonia, what have you got? Sorry, I cant sleep. "Drink make my head spin so much." Where are you going? I have a dry throat, I'm going to drink a glass of water. "Stay in bed," huh? Lie down, I'll take it for you. Yes! Yes, yes. If one who has forgotten to buy what I think, I choke it. Yes? What is it? It is me, doctor, Antonia's sister-in-law. Antonia's sister-in-law? Oh my God, my God! Did she poison herself? Yes she committed suicide? No, for the moment, but it might if she doesn't listen to me right. Early in the morning you should be at the Superintendency. Yes Yes Yes. I will do as you say. Yes Yes Yes. I'll go right away. - Capuchinos ready, Professor. - Thanks, Aldo. Where is it beautiful? - In Palermo. To the Superintendency of Studies. - Ah... - The cappuccino here is very good. - Thank you Madam. Indeed, I take advantage of it... ...and I also buy two dresses, two pairs of shoes and two blouses. Yes, are you going with him. Sooner or later...? - It's the bus, Professor. - Thanks, Aldo. - Thanks. Look, when was the last time that the teacher went to Palermo? Now I tell you. So... Mayor, doctor... professor. On April 14, always at the Superintendency. Mm... "This fact stinks to me." "Here cat hatches us". At 300 lire each... Mastro Ragusa... - As ?! - 40 crates... - But how, another increase in mineral water? - Eh, what are you going to do, Mastro Ragusa? - But do you want to do this aqueduct? - Eh, "you want to do it"... But then you are fools! - And why? I have here the statistics of Palermo, Catania, Ragusa, Syracuse, Enna... - They are all cities served from the aqueduct. - So? But how "then"? A confidence, Mastro Ragusa. The water of the continent it makes our women sterile. - Uh, fuck! - Yet it is the truth. - Engineer, let's do one thing. You send me 10 boxes for me, 10 for mine daughter who got married and 10 for the grandmother. - Oh, also for the grandmother? - Eh, grandma! Grandmother too, engineer. - So, what have you got? - Sorry, sorry, I have an urgent business to resolve. - "Say hello"! - "Say hello", engineer. Dunno... - Madam, what a beautiful combination! - Really beautiful. - Here, help me. - You are welcome. Done. Where do we go? - At my home. - At her house? Longest way, huh? You are welcome. How beautiful it is here. Yes, yes, nice, but... Let's do like this, she talks about it with her sister-in-law Antonia... ...and then, when you have decided, you give me a "call". - If I don't give you a "shot"... - Sure. - But of lupara, however. Goodbye... "bell'Antonio"! - No, my love, no! - The fuck is dead! Now all that remains is to complete the work. But maybe it's the heat, the emotion... You will see, my love, it will pass you. - For us there will always be a tomorrow! - It's over! It's over before we start! No love... You'll get some medicine from America. She takes them all over the country, you can take them too, can't you? "Garrusu", I have become! It is an incurable disease! Noi my love. I... - It's over! - I will save you. Hello, aunt. I'm late? - No, just in time. Sit down we eat. - Right away, aunt. - You like? - They're beautiful. Let's put them here, otherwise the chicken gets cold. - Listen, tonight there is a premiere at Eden, we go there? - Yeah, fine. But without the advice of the revolution around, huh? Thanks. The anonymous trapanese? The professor is waiting for you. - Enough, enough. this "goes to the head"! - What's wrong with that? Once in a while... How strong is this Moscato. Farmers Pantelleria associates do it really good. Now we need a coffee. You want? Ah, yes. Then? I am always a Dongiovanni. I had a psychological block... ...due to the fact that I have you desired for years... as a wife. Only marriage will save me. Confetti, white dress... See what you can do. Ready with coffee. - How did it go today? - How was it supposed to go? Usual... When I'm prepared, nothing... ...when instead the lesson I don't know, they "get me" right away. Do you know what my trouble is? I just can't pretend. It's your best side. Hello? Yes, engineer, it's me. Yes, yes, tell me. Okay, ? get it. With the documents of the property. But at the price I said, huh? Okay, I get it. By the notary for the stipulation. Yes. Yes, yes, don't worry. I will report to my sister-in-law Antonia as soon as she returns. It's all OK. I nothing, you can imagine... I was so sorry for him: poor sparrow. - But do you know what he did? - No, but I can imagine. He will have developed such a complex of guilt that he will have bought you all of Palermo. He waits. I'll show you. It is half ruined. - Look, do you like it? - Mm... Beautiful gift. Come on, I'll show you something. - Look. - I'm curious. - Uh... - Do you like it? - In conclusion It was an interesting day. You are happy? We made certain cries... - And Saro where is he? - He couldn't come, she phoned. - It's from Massimo. - Oh yes? She says they had a lot of homework. But you finish telling me. Come on, then, let's get out of the bar. Dearest! Finally a woman on time. I thought she wasn't coming anymore. - Dear Toto, let's talk you. - Well, Gloria. Damn! Did you understand? And then they say the campaign doesn't pay off. It's all old, home stuff. Saracens, Garibaldians, Germans, Americans... We didn't do anything else than carrying it up and down the cellar. You are welcome. - Cedrata, mint, whiskey...? - Mint, thank you. It will be, but behind any luck a crime is hiding. What's yours? I'm the last male in the direct line of the De Vito Palmachiara Urzi. - Is that enough for all this? - No. You have to go to the construction site at 10, do the mess, otherwise the first unskilled worker will give you a damn. You have to study when others are asleep. So one gets used to it to stay awake day and night. Then, as soon as one becomes a surveyor... ...maybe municipal, maybe provincial... ...maybe office manager tax technician, that's it. Say, you won't be one of those against intelligence? - If it is used to remove the necessary items others do. - Strange for a woman to say this. Here we spend our life to guarantee the superfluous to wives and lovers. In return we receive always and only one thing... With us you can have it the same, but on an equal footing. - Are you on the pill? - No, take away the pleasure of the risk and empower the act. Makes the male conscious of nonsense which combines when the partner gives up. An interesting theory. We want to talk about something that concerns us a little more closely? Mom? Dear Mrs. Gloria, I've heard so much about her... ...but reality surpasses fantasy. - Good evening, lady. - My mother. She is the sole administrator of the company that she would buy your land. Mrs. Lamborghini, representing and in turn heir to the property. - I'm sure you'll find an agreement. Hello Mom. - Hello. Mrs... Of course not before having had tea. With real pleasure, Baroness. And how come you don't smoke? Verifying a relationship is the after. If it goes, I like to talk. Turn it off, talker. "This sale is made and accepted with the annexes and connected..." "...uses and services, active and passive..." "...in the state of fact and law in which you can find the Lamborghini estate." "Article 3: the price agreed between parts for sale is ITL 200 million." "Therefore the sellers release extensive release and receipt of the balance." Ciccio, get it signed. Listen'... ...you have to explain to me how you got it triple what they offered me. Do you know what Granny McAllister said? "Every woman own her luck and she doesn't know it." You seduced him! I have to leave tomorrow. - Why? - I talked to the boss, though I'm not going to go back to the end of the nun right away. - But I'll be back soon. - This summer? I'll make Saro leave your room. - For your wedding, right? - You make it easy! Shall we start again? Have you forgotten about Saro? Did you see how he got sullen? Let's hope no one has gossiped. It is so easy to hurt him. Disbelieve, He is much more mature than he seems. Listen, I'm talking to Saro, you do not meddle. - Someone in class today he was witty. - Oh yes? - They all started talking about that they would have grown up. - And you? Since I didn't speak, they asked me if it is true that the pharmacist will do... "specially after a certain trip to Palermo. But what do you believe? Are people stupid? But why? I do not understand! When the notary said 200 million... ...everyone understood that the aunt she had slept with the surveyor! You are two whores! Here's what you are! Two whores! In Palermo with that son of a dog, without the minimal respect for my father's memory! And my poor uncle... But I'm not dead yet! - Put the pharmacist in the frame! - Saro! Antonia, what happened? I saw Saro... I knew it, I didn't have to go to Palermo! I knew it! Now I'm talking to it. Wait up! - Find him in golf course. - Oh, what a fool! Saro! Saro! Saro! Saro, where are you? Answer me! Saro? Saro, look at me. Wait, come here. - Are you in love with me? Yes or no? - Yes. - With what hopes? - None. A desperate love then. Give me a kiss. - So you want from me what you deny to the others. - What, aunt? - Love, Saro. Your mother is alone, but she is still a beautiful, desired woman. One day you will fall in love, Saro... ...and maybe in 10 years you will put it aside to take care only of your wife and her children. And your mother will be too old to rebuilda life. No, aunt, I don't want anyone instead of my father! You're just a selfish kid and overbearing! Just like he was! Sorry, aunt. I'm a coward! No, Saro, cowards never apologize. I know you will understand. Yes, you will understand. Saro, pack your aunt's bags. Departures are always a bit sad. - Three months and I'll be back. What do you say, will you make it? - Mah! - From Alitalia, they take care of everything. - Thanks. Oh, no "glitter", otherwise I'm moved too! Bye! - We better go now or there principal chases both of them. - Yes mom. - Good morning, dear doctor! - Huh?! - Good morning, Mrs. Antonia. - Good morning. Hi, Saro! Good morning, Mrs. Antonia. Sunday I come with the pasta! Oh, mind you, I'll be a pharmacist alone to overcome youth unemployment! Then I want a Honda, the boat and the stereo. - But will we also have siblings? - Walk, braggart! (The feminist, the committed, the woman with a strong, strong-willed character...) (...the one who saves widows and the grandchildren of rapacious surveyors...) (...that every time he looked at you "your voice was dying in your throat".) (How do the Italians say? "What a bitch you are!") - Have you ever been to Etna? - No, why? - She Sicilians came: there was snow, inside the incandescent magma. - Pero! (He didnt even come to say hello the "incandescent magma".) (And then why would she have to? She did such a clear, linear relationship...) (I give one thing to you, you give me one thing.) You can still have it with us, but on an equal footing. (Sure, that of the bed. More flat than that.) (Mm! But she did it to have the land, she paid dearly for it!) (Wait until I get on the plane, when no one sees me...) (...I want to have one of those cries...) - What do you want? - To someone "burns", he doesn't want to end up like the cuckold. Friends, don't worry, it's a question of love. Walk! Go away! You?! It is a family tradition. I've been to many others. Maybe I'm not the right kind of woman... ...fora certain widespread mentality southern, however to be debunked! - Have you really had that many? - Yes, and I will have many. But would you want me as I am? I seem to have already proved it to you. Or not? You know what he told me this morning mother giving me this ring? You know? We feel. She said to me: "My son, if a woman, after a thousand experiences she chooses you..." "...do you know what it means?" - No. - "That you are better than the first thousand." Take care of the suitcases.
