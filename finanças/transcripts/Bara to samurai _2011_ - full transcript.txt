You dirty moustachioed old rat! Cerveza, no! Now what? Stay calm. You snuck in more men? Exactly! We knew you were women pirates trying to crush the men pirates. Abunch of women! Since you wanted to set yourselves above men... ...we thought we'd show you what real men of the sea are like. My men hid in the cargo to wait for our chance. Is that what real men do?! Balba, you fiend! Didn't you call me the most evil pirate in the Atlantic? You're really just a simple-minded jerk. What?! Shoot if you're going to. Cap'n! That's fine with me! Get em! Looks like you've been got first! Who are you? You dress funny. I'm bodyguard to the lovely Anne. Tknew you'd sneak in help. 1 said you were simple-minded. What?! Let's take care of them, quick. Right. Get em! Don't kill them! Just throw them in the sea. Help! Oh no you don't! You! What's your name? Iam Goemon, Great Thief of the Seven Seas. Ishikawa Goemon! Don't forget! Charging into the blue, chasing a dream A flesh wound's just a love-tap if you want to be free Where's the next stage? If you sail the seven seas A pretty girl finds Thrills and adventure Any time or place you fall in love Woman is a rose, man is a samurai Stop your complaining and come on It's free! It's Goemon's original pirate tour Gold, silver, silk, lingerie, take anything you want Love's the only thing you can't steal The greatest treasure of all Immortal, shining on Woman is a rose, man is a samurai Striking a daredevil pose, all right!

We tweaked Balba's nose It feels great, so let's drink! This is some party! I've seen lots of ports, but this is just as good as Barcelona. That's right! Here in Cansaone With calm seas and good roads, it's the best place In all Iberia This harbor is good for trade And culture, too Allin a small country afifth the size Of Spain or France Aport is a country's lifeline That's right! And all Vino lives for is liquor and men Look who's talking! Sangria! Now, now, now... First of all, cheers! Well done, cheers! We tweaked Balba's nose It feels great! First of all, cheers! Serves him right! Cheers! The look on Balba's face alone Is worth a hundred toasts! Cap'n! How did it go? The man at the black market gave Us a good price. When we said we'd robbed... ...Balba Negro of the Black Moustache... ...he laughed and laughed! They don't like him here. Itwas all dresses and women's jewelry. No one likes a pirate who only robs the weak! Our Cap'n, on the other hand... ...helps the weak against the strong. She's a better man than all of them! That's why they love her here! He still got away with abunch of treasure chests. He's stubborn, so watch out. If he shows up again, we'll stick it to him again. Right? That's right! With those pirates gallivanting around... ...the merchant ships had stopped calling here. Thank you, Anne! If the government comes after you... ...we'll let you know! Hey! Hey! Anne! The men of Canseone will look out for you! Thank you! Guv'nor! Drinks all round! You blow through money... ...like a tornado! Life is short Hanging onto money, saving it up What's the use? Everyone says that, but that's not what they really think. Money's alive Shut it away somewhere And it dies If money dies, so does the town That's not true! The money you spend Goes to someone else Then they spend it again and the money goes round and round Times get better and the town comes back to life That's an interesting idea... We steal back stolen money Pirates for justice! We give it back to the country Whoo! Pirates! So drink up and don't be shy You're quite the woman! You're different, too. You came to Cordonia from that island in the east... What was it called? Japan. Japan, an island far to the east... You're a ‘samurai', right? No, I'm just a thief. But you can fight. Our knights can't take you. You cleaned up Balba and his henchmen. I'min love! Tjust have the gift. Well! Why did the gifted Mr Goemon... ...travel all the way across the ocean... ...to become a bodyguard to a pirate? That's the one thing... ...Ican'tfigure out. That's because you're pirates' pirates. Tlike that, I keep telling you. Yeah, but... Helles! She gets stroppy when she's drunk. Excuse her. Idon't mind Aman who wouldn't help A beautiful woman like you Is a fool with no backbone Why, thank you. Here's your share. Thave no need of your money Having your heart will be enough So you may say But you took the money, didn't you A piece of your heart of gold. Yeah, right! But more than a man who just works Aman who drives away danger And takes the pay he's due IsamanIcan trust Hey! Nobody move! It's me they want. think I know who itis. Just go on drinking. Goemon! Don't worry about me. I'm not. You've got everyone else's money. Hurry back or we'll drink everything. Tknow. Hey, you louse! Can you believe that! You've got to watch that guy! You're right. Cap'n, how long are you going to keep him around? I don't know. He just showed up. Idon'tgetit. You know what? That guy's testing us. He's waiting for his chance. Ican seeitin his attitude. Am1Iright? Cap'n? Iwonder... But will he be all right? He said he'd be back. Don't worry about that. Yes. The one to worry about... ...isyou. Hey! So you can see with your left eye... Anne the Tornado... ...your unseemly pretensions to piracy areatanend. You will come with me. Who are you? Army? Tam De Cal, Head of the King of Cordonia's Guards. ‘De Cal? Come along. Where? The castle. Ihave a few things to ask you. Lay a hand on the Cap'n... ...and you'll be sorry! Arrest her and all Canseone will rise against you! So the rumors are correct. You're very popular. But are you sure about this? Well? Be careful, or Canseone will face the Kingdom of Cordonia. Sir? Hold your fire! Anne the Tornado, Pirate for Justice, defender of the weak... ...Ido not believe your self-esteem would let you embroil these people... ..inawar. Am1Iright? A wise decision. Cap'n! Stay calm. You don't need to worry. Don't try anything. But... Imean it! Sangria, you're in charge. All right. Come along! Come out, Desko. Tknow that was you. It's not ‘Desko'. Tam ‘Desperado Hyonoshin'! Oh yeah, that's right. It wouldn't have been right to shoot you. Tam sworn to take your head in fair combat. Fair's good. 1t'd be even better if you'd just go away and not show up again. Would I do that? If you're a samurai you're ready... ...to face death! I'ma thief, not a samurai. You are still aman of Japan! And today we settle things. Draw, Goemon! Draw! Didn't you say ‘fair combat'? Yeah. So what? What's fair about a gun against a sword? You draw, I shoot. That's fair. Look at the distance! I draw my sword: ‘Hyah!" You go ‘bam'! ‘Agh! You got me!' If you want ‘fair', get a sword. What?! You don't understand the meaning of ‘fair'! If I hide somewhere and shoot you from a distance... ...then I'm a coward. But if I turn up in front of you and shoot you... ...isn"t that fair? Whatever. But you'd better shoot me right through the heart. I'll cut your head off if you don't. Big talk! Die! You cheated. That was so easy! How? It's an established fact... ...that money saves lives. Why are you laughing? Why don't you kill me? Because we're both Japanese Why do we have to fight aduel to the death In Europe? Because we're Japanese! Now I'm empty-handed Ican't go home I need your head to take back as a souvenir Is my head worth that much? Twill return in glory with the head of The great villain Who the King of Japan himself wants dead Who told you that? My late father. Your father Was a samurai But your mother was Spanish You were born On this continent There's no way you can ever go to Japan You shut up! Japan's been closed off. They've broken relations with Spain. We have no country we can go home to. So what? If the gate's closed I'll kick it open, like a true samurai! That's impossible! Look at yourself What land do you come from With a name like ‘Desperado Hyonoshin'? Is this a spaghetti western or achanbara sword movie? What about you? A bodyguard with a Japanese sword Still wearing a fundoshi even in Europe Who are you to talk? You're right I'm betwixt and between, too. But for two odd men out Fighting each other to the death Is the last thing we should do Goemon! Goemon, where are you?! You owe me a duel! We'll meet again! There he is! What's wrong? They took the Cap'n away! Anne? The King's Guards! From the castle? She went quietly to protect us. We can't just stand and watch! The townsfolk are up in arms! There could be a riot! The Cap'n doesn't want people hurt. You're a break-and-enter artist. That's your specialty, right? So I'm to steal back your greatest treasure? Keep the townsfolk quiet. I'll steal back... ...your treasure, Anne the Tornado. Entrez. Well, De Cal? She put up some resistance, but we managed. Thank you, De Cal! Bring her in. Withdraw. What do you want? This doesn't look like a court. Two pairs of glasses? And a telescope? Del Sol! Honey! The eye like the sun! And the corona shining around it! No mistake! Dear God You are with us And now Cordonia is saved Why are you singing? What do you mean? And put away that telescope. Iam Count Gafas de Nervioso. 1serve as Admiral of the Navy. This is my wife Elizabetta. Please forgive our poor manners Anne of Arvida What's with the singing? ‘Arvida'? Yes! You are the only daughter... ...of Valiente III of Arvida, former king of Cordonia. You are the only descendant... ...of Cordonia's royal house. The only one Why do you keep singing?! I apologize. We had to arrest you so as not to rouse suspicion. It was the only way If Larkham and the others were to find out, all... All would be lost Elizabetta, you can stop singing. Ithink Lady Anne will understand... ...very well. Excuse me! I don't understand. Neither what this is about, nor that stupid singing. Me, aqueen? I'mapirate. I grew up among pirates. You just think that. No, I'don't. You are the child of Valiente's eighth wife. Your mother was English. When you were one year old... ...pirates attacked your ship on your way there. Our records say that you were both killed. But you survived, to be raised by the pirates. So my father is my real father's sworn enemy? That sounds like a fairy tale. Itcan't be true. Your eye is absolute proof. You know yourself... ...you have a gold ring around the iris of your left eye. Yeah, but... So did Valiente III. Because it resembles the sun's flame, and also a crown, they are called... ...0Jos del sol... ...'eyes of the sun'... ...and /os ojos de Ja corona... ... ‘eyes of the crown'. When the king learned his child had this eye, he was overjoyed. He declared the baby... ...'Anne, child of the sun'. That eye proves you are of royal blood. If not... ...why did you hide it? Dad said salt water would bother it... ‘Dad' meaning that pirate... Yeah, ‘Dad'! Yes, of course. But now you are this country's last hope! You fell into piracy, but not into evil. All the more admirable in one of royal blood. We wish you to devote your talents to your subjects. That's the only way to drive out that grasping Prime Minister! Prime Minister? Go against Prime Minister Larkham? The country's most powerful man? Yes. "Bye. Make an enemy of him and you die. Every pirate knows that. Why would I take him on? Exactly. He eliminates anyone in his way. Like he did your father. He poisoned His Majesty King Valiente. What? Anyway, he wasn't my father. Are you sure? A portrait of Valiente III. Seen through this, the resemblance is striking. Look. And again! The eye... ...of the sun! The eye of the crown! This is too much. I'm going. Where? My ship. Wait, Lady Anne! What's wrong? What's that? It looks like tribute for the Prime Minister. From who? There are always things arriving for him. Ican'tkeep track. Stop! Not that way! That's the Prime Minister's chamber! Wait, Lady Anne! Larkham de Bribon, savior of Cordonia! Larkham de Bribon, Prime Minister of Cordonia! Bravo Bribon! Bribon! Bribon! Bravo Bribon! Bribon! Bribon! Bravo to our Prime Minister Bribon is his name Larkham de Bribon Bravo to his unstinting labors With undiminished faith Building the future of the kingdom Our leader Leave everything to me Devote your entire being To this land With what gratitude and joy Do those magnificent words Thrill me to my nether regions Over what moonless sea With what cowards for sailors Would I cross if you were there Father Bravo to our Prime Minister Bribon is his name Larkham de Bribon Bravo to his all-seeing wisdom A moral exemplar Building the future of the kingdom Our leader Bravo Bribon! Bribon! Bribon! Bravo Bribon! Bribon! Bribon! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. But please do not forget... ...the Arvidas are the royal house of Cordonia. Yes! With the royal line extinct... ...the Prime Minister holds the reins of government... ...but as an emergency measure. wish you to think of me as the foundation... ...upon which the true royal house... ...Will be restored. How like you, Father, to think only of the nation! The perfect Prime Minister! Ladies and gentlemen, we have asked you here... ...because today is the day the Prime Minister's grand-daughter... ...and niece to Lady Marrone... ...Pony de Bribon will choose a husband! What happiness awaits he who captures the heart... ...of the greatest beauty in Cordonia! Ah, Pony! Today you are lovelier than ever. Thank you, Grandfather. Pony... ...today the greatest nobles in all Cordonia are here. You are of age now, so find one and settle down. Marriage is awoman's greatest joy. Like you and Duke Avantgarde? Yes. Then why, with Duke Avantgarde as your husband... ...do you remain in this castle? Ido so out of concern for Father and you. Your father died at war, and your mother from disease. You could not be left alone. But now... ...your gentlemen await. The first candidate Is Count Doccano Of a fine pedigree Afully loaded old dandy Too short. Marquis Jenkins, then Ahighly skilled scientist A genius of whom it is said He can turn paper into gold Ill-starred. Aman of great for-funa Viscount Maguro-mal With a fleet of nine ships He has loads 0' money Agazillionaire He has fish eyes. No, no, no. Pony doesn't seem to like any of them. What? Pony... Grandpa's doing all the deciding. You keep quiet, Pony! Pony! None of your lip! Watch your mouth! You're still young, Pony, Pony There are lots of men around If they find no favor In the Prime Minister's eye It's over And that's it! Please excuse a willful young lady. That will be all. The Prime Minister has spoken! I'm afraid, gentlemen... ...we'll be seeing you. Idon't care if he's the Prime Minister. Idon't have fish eyes! Is there a problem? You have us, sir, as only the Prime Minister could. He iis testing our patience, seeing right through us. Anger is uncivilized, Viscount Maguromal. But... Even in these quiet times, he never lets down his guard. Even with the death of its king, all in Cordonia... ...isin order! With you here, the land need not fear. 1, Doccano... ...am filled with admiration! Come, let us withdraw. Pony, return to your chambers. Already? None of them was appropriate for you. Of that I am sure. Go! All right, Grandfather. Anice, obedient child. And now, who do we crush? Indeed! Ibelieve it should be... ... Viscount Maguromal. No. Ithink Doccano. Tknew you'd understand, Marrone. Doccano? But he supports you. He sees through our plans, and pretends to go along. He's exactly the kind who has knives out for us. We have to crush him. Espada! I've heard everything... ...Lady Marrone. He's out, just like that?! He's a senior member of the troupe! Fast work, as always. Tam not worthy of such praise. Well, well, well! Well, well, well! What, is it tribute time already? Let's see! Isn't this lovely! And this is a trove of Spanish gold coins. And this chest in the middle! What can it be? Hi. Hi. The water's fine. Take your clothes off and come on in, honey... Sorry! Hey, wait a minute! What's going on here, Balba?! Here! We ignore what you do in exchange for three treasure chests a month. That's the deal. Today there's only two. What gives? Yes, well, about that little matter... It's like, you know, uh... I'm the third. I'matreasure... Don't give me that! Who lets you swagger around on the high seas? The Prime Minister Larkham, that's who! And you'd better not forget to leave our navy alone! I didn't forget! I remember! Tknow! But this time two was all we could do! A woman pirate attacked us and this is all we got away with! I'm doing the very best I can! A woman pirate? Oh, Anne the Tornado... Then you know what I mean. You'd never think a woman was so smart and so tough. You have a very bad habit... ...of underestimating women. You're absolutely right! But leave her to me. 1, Balba Negro, the next time we meet... ...the very next time... ...I'llbeat her toa pulp... ... stretch her on the rack... ...and use her for a bridge over the Strait of Dover! Big talk, Balba! You! Lady Anne! No! Didn't you hear them? The Prime Minister is hooked up with a pirate! You should talk! Pirates have their pride. I thought those chests looked familiar. So you're their puppet! The ‘grasping Prime Minister"... You were right, Specs. ‘Gafas'. Well, Admiral Gafas! Aman in your position... ...bringing a pirate into the castle! You will pay for this! Be silent, Gonzance, you poodle! Having seen this, do you still wish to go back to sea? Well... You are our only hope. Please, Lady Anne! There's only me? Yes. Right! I've made up my mind. Your hopes are on her? Is that all your country means to you? She is not a mere pirate! She is Anne of Arvida... ...the orphaned child of Valiente III of Arvida... ...king of Cordonia. So Anne is the queen? Nonsense! The wind from the Bay of Biscay has clouded your glasses. Allright... .Tllproveit. Close-up! Real close! LLL. Eye! Eye! Eye! The gjo del sol! The coronal And this! The chronicle of her birth. Her left eye is the eye of the sun... ...itsays. She's really a princess?! Welcome home, Lady Anne. 1, Larkham, rejoice from my heart... ...at the return of our royal house. Take your place upon the throne. Should I? What's all this about?! ‘What? What else? The future of Cordonia. The kingdom is now as it was before! Our fears for the future are behind us. Itis a fine thing! Be careful! Oh, dear! Why so suspicious? Have I not always said... ...I would restore the House of Arvida? Or are you perhaps hiding something murky? No! Never. Lady Anne, your throne. Prime Minister... ...you've spoken fine words. But a man who deals with pirates for his own benefit... ...isn"t someone I trust that easily. Oh, you're concerned about that? Have no fear. Espada! Don't move! Or your moustache will stay but your head won't. That's impossible! OK, I' believe you! The Prime Minister planned all this. This was the best way to capture this brutal pirate... ...without resorting to violence. We simply pretended to be in league with him. This treasure... ...all goes into the nation's coffers. To say itis for our use is a calumny. What is your wish, Lady Anne? If you so desire, here and now... ...we can cut off this pirate's head. Wait! Wait. We'll try him. All criminals must have afair trial. Isee. Espada, take him to the cells. Yes, sir. Come along. Anne! Anne! Thank you! So that is your decision, then... ...Queen Anne? ‘Queen'? Me? That is what restoration of the royal house means. You weren't ready for that when you came to this castle? Yes, Iwas! Iam the Queen of Cordonia... ...Anne of Arvida! Well said! Very good! Marrone, prepare for a ball... ...inone month's time. Wonderful! Aball? To celebrate the ascension of Cordonia's new queen. We'llinvite... ...nobles from Spain and France, too. So soon? However... ...we must be careful. Foolish actions on our part could destroy the country. The great powers hone their fangs, awaiting their chance... ...to seize Cordonia. You must take care as queen... ...to do nothing to bring shame upon yourself. The ball will be more than amere gala event. Act as if you were on the sea you know so well. You could be swallowed up by a storm. Tlook forward to this... ... Your Majesty. This crown... ...is heavy! Your Majesty! Cut that out! That ‘queen' stuff is too heavy. There's no time for that now. The die has been cast. Larkham certainly took it very well... The baby with the sun eye is in the chronicle. They can't overcome the fact that Anne is of royal blood. They'll probably try to manipulate her once she's installed on the throne. And the fact is that for now she won't be able to govern... ...without Larkham's help. You don't agree? Can'tIjust get rid of them? Itis not that easy to govern a country. Avyear. Take a year and let Larkham teach you the tricks of governing. When you have consolidated your power... ...then you can take them on. Ayear?! No. Firsta month. The ball is in one month. By then you must become a lady who is at ease anywhere. Alady? Me? That's right. Aball is war! Offend our nobles, or those from neighboring lands, and all is lost. I'm afraid Marrone was right. So Iwill teach you. Let's begin. There isn't much time. Yes Yes The ten things that mark a lady Number one Straight back Chest out Elegant posture Number two Aclear smile Refined interests An air of elegance Number three You must cleanly parry The dirty jokes Of those lecherous barons Without giving offence You must You must You must, you must Number four Table manners Wineisatrap No more than five glasses Number five Dance! You must dance well Embarrass yourself and you're dead Number six With ambassadors Be very aware You must seek out what their true intentions are You must You must, you must With noble ladies, la-di-da Being beautiful Isnosin Even if a young lord Thus loses his life for love Number seven A corset drawn tight Shallow breathing All for the sake of undying beauty Number eight In Spanish, jhola! In French, bonjour Do not neglect your languages Number nine Eyes that sparkle enough To fell even the Goddess Athena ‘Ten!' and pose Be alluring Luring, luring Luring, luring Anoble lady, la-di-da Must sweetly Hold this tune And bloom You are the belle of the ball Yes Yes Those are the ten things that mark a lady One thing... Yes? This. It suits you! No, it doesn't. It keeps shifting forward. It does? When I was a child What I wanted to be Was one of the young women Gathered in the salon Time went by My dream came true But now I'm miserable Amarionette An arranged marriage I'ma political tool With Grandfather Pulling the strings Iplay The pretty grand-daughter But where is The real me? When they're done with me they might throw me away Like this pile Of old clothes Anoble lady, la-di-da I can't go on being a good girl Ina flowery dress stained with tears No one sees Iwon'tdo it! What's this? Here goes! Cutitout! I'm not a cushion! Quiet, It's sweet! Isita pastry? Amanju. ‘Manju'? From Nippon. Where? Here you call it ‘Zipang'. It's way across the sea. Zipang? I've heard of it! It's aland of gold, as far east as you can go. You're well-read. You've come from Zipang? Why? Oh, Tknow! You're a pirate! Be quiet, will you! Oh, Twon't scream. Why are you here? To kidnap me? That must be it. Thendo it. You're very calm. But why? For a ransom? Or to free political prisoners? To bring rule by the people? Whatever. Just keep it short and simple. Grandpa's not a patient man. I'm not kidnapping you. What? What?! Tam Pony de Bribon, I'll have you know. The Prime Minister's my grandpa. Yeah... Well, then... why don't you want to kidnap me? I'm after something else. You're lying! I don't believe that. don't believe this! You want to be kidnapped? It's more like I'm used to it. You are? It happens all the time. Grandpa has lots of enemies. But you'd better be careful. I'msstill alive, and everyone who kidnapped me got beheaded. That's scary. Are you that well-guarded? I dunno. Does it [ook that way? Well, Tknow how you feel from that song. Why not just run away? That's easy for you to say. You can't? I'm smart enough to know I can't survive outside the castle. Listen, I'm here looking for a woman pirate named Anne. Anne? I think she's the queen now. Isee. Well, I guess... The queen?! They said she was the king's daughter. Yeah? Yeah. What's going on?! I'll take you to her. Can you? Tjust love... ...hidden rooms and secret passages and all that stuff. That's the only way I can be alone. Ithink I can get to where she is. That'd be great. Hide! ow! ow! Quit pushing! Push, push, push, push, push! Pushing me in the back! Just say where to go! Cutitout! What are these clothes? Hey, where are the cells? They won't be necessary. What? Then what about my trial? You attacked us and tried to run. We were forced to fight back... ...and in the end we were forced to Kill you. What's with the past tense?! So now you don't need me you just kill me? We're free to kill pirates. If you want to blame someone, blame that Anne for showing up. Wait! Wait! If you're going to kill me... ...grant me one last request! What? To wear a dress. Areddress. One of those. That red one. I've always wanted to die in beautiful clothes. Is that weird? Yeah, it's weird. An old man with a moustache... But I love beautiful things. I love pretty clothes. Talways... ...did. This sadness No one understands Moustachioed Middle-aged But at heart a young girl Icouldn't help myself 1 attacked ships ‘Omigod! This is so cute!' I'said, and stole stuff And suddenly I was a pirate Put this on, Mr Pirate! This is so pretty! A person should live the way their heart says It might look weird to other people But who cares? If you're someone who's found his true self at last Go for it! I'm with you Well? It's not ‘you'. But that doesn't matter. It's cool It might look weird to other people But who cares? I'm going for it! I'ma girl, after all Even moustachioed Even middle-aged Even middle-aged Even a pirate You're a girl, after all Pony... Please, Aunt Marrone! Don't kill this moustachioed Susan Boyle of a pirate! That dress looks awful on him, but let his dreams come true! Oh, dear! The pirate took her hostage, and out of sympathy for him... ...she went over to his side! How provoking! Taking Pony hostage to escape! Over my dead body! So that's the story, huh? Aunt! It's a good thing... ...we saved you from that terrible pirate. But everything's all right now. Off you go. Get going! No, Aunt! Listen to me! Who... ...areyou?! Yes, indeed! Who am I? A masked pervert. No, but that doesn't matter. Come on, Balba. That stinks! What is that? It stinks! Those perverts! Find them! Yuck! This stinks! Ican't see a thing! Hey! What's this doing here?! What are you looking at?! On the Cordonia border... Where are the others? There's only us left. The bandits killed the rest. Isee. Dosanko! Come back! This way! You aristos made us work pretty hard. All we wanted was your money. See what happens when you fight back? Varlets! Know whom you stand before! This is Charles, Prince of the Duchy of Boscoyne! Pierre! Don't tell them that! So you're a prince, huh? Tguess we can't let you get away alive, then. We just wanted your money... ...but if we've attacked a prince, the army will be after us. Now you've seen our faces, we'll have to take your life. Ttold you! Say your prayers! Who are you?! Yeah! Who?! The bandits Malgone and Gesso, I presume... When I close my eyes it's there The home I've never seen Ablizzard of cherry blossom petals, shining so bright Why do I break down and cry? This isn't the time for crying! The bounty on you is mine! Pull the trigger and they scatter The sunset burns with red blood again I feel no hatred for you But I have to shut you down My burning samurai soul This mission lodged in my heart It would shame me to overlook Prey for which there is a reward If I keep wandering this wasteland alone Icanreach Japan Task the gods why I was born The answer vanishes in gunfire When I close my eyes it's there The home I've never seen Ablizzard of cherry blossom petals, shining so bright Why do I break down and cry? Guys! Your head is worth seven gold coins. Malgone, yours is worth... five! I'm worth less than him?! Thank you! Your clothes look foreign... The samurai... ...Desperado Hyonoshin. Oh, you're a clown... Never say that again. Tama bounty hunter! Sorry! I'm... Prince of Boscoyne. You knew? You shouted it, stupid. I'msorry. You are brave to travel here with such a small party. We'reina hurry. We're late for the ball. Aball? That's a stupid reason to get killed. You address a prince! Shall I talk with this? Sorry. Tknow! Why don't you escort us? Let's just go home. It's the pirate queen's debut. This I have to see! You're hopeless! ‘The pirate queen'? The new queen of Cordonia was a pirate. A pirate? What's her name? Anne of Arvida, but as a pirate she was... ‘Anne the Tornado'... You're well-informed. Then maybe... ...he's there. Who? No one. How much? Your Highness! 3,000 charles? ‘Charles'? That's your name! He is so loved in Boscoyne they named the money after him! He's my cousin. One charle is worth 10,000 pierres. You, too? Yes! He is worth 10,000 of me. And you will earn 3,000 of him for one night's work. Not bad! Idunno... What?! That's 3,000 of me! We'll discuss the money later. Follow me. Cordonia castle is... ...this way. Wait! Don't leave me, Your Highness! Glistening chandeliers The sound of the waltz A magnificent ball This is a lady's battleground Adress in the latest fashion is awoman's armor In the same way a man mounts up and rides to war This is a fight to the finish, with taste fanning its flames To be scorned is fatal While men polish their swords The women polish masks of make-up If men pierce enemies with their spears Women pierce hearts with love's arrows You want to feel superior Jealousy means you lose You want a real battle to the death? You'll find it in women's emotions A magnificent ball This is a lady's battleground Imade it! Well, well! Prince Charles! But why are you alone? My companions are in the antechamber. They prefer the food to the dance. Oh, dear! I'm sorry, I don't believe we've met. Tam Count Mongoe de Veramaccha! ‘Slap!' Of course! Ah, hello! It's been a long time. Thave your father's M.C. Hammer tickets. Admiral Gafas... ...how goes it with the new queen? What do you mean? Thope she is not displeased... ...with the dress that has been run up for her so quickly. I thank you for your concern. However... ...you need have no fear on that account. The new queen of Cordonia... ...Her Majesty Anne of Arvida graces us with her presence. Wow! A monarch to reckon with! Twelcome you all to the castle of Cordonia. Will you dance... ... Your Majesty? Prince Charles, heir to the Duchy of Boscoyne. Ican'tdance in this dress! You must not shame the prince of a neighboring land. Care to dance, Miss? I've seen you before... I don't think so. Your name? Tam Count Mongoe. So clothes make the woman, Anne? Goemon? Sorry, chandelier Here comes the flamenco A magnificent ball Thisis a lady's Battleground I've been through so many bloody battles Life is a constant struggle I've tried taking refuge Inaman's heart But maybe love is The hardest battle of all The flames blaze up in the blood Look out!

Wonderful, Your Majesty! Thanks, Your Highness. Tam sure the news is spreading through Europe... ...of the new rose of Cordonia. Twill spread it myself! Well, well! Nothing could be more encouraging than to hear Your Highness say so! You have my thanks. Miss, I take my leave. Until we meet again... Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! Take it easy! What's going on here? That's what I'd like to know! How did you become queen? It's a long story. I came to check things out. Iwouldn't stick out at the ball. You sure did stick out! That hand-clapping? That saved your life! Yeah. Thanks for that. Contrition! I don't dare take my eyes off that woman. The Duchess? Marrone? You know her? Balba told me. When? I'saved him. From the cells? You thought he was in the cells? I mean to put him on trial now the ball's over. Isee. So you haven't heard. There wasn't going to be a trial. They meant to quietly eliminate him. I'saved him. So that's what that old so-and-so was upto... Well, Anne... ... ‘eye of the sun' or not... ...can you go from a pirate's life to being a queen? Well... Ithink you're better off at sea with the wind in your hair. And not just me. Your crew does, too. Right? Cap'n! Guys! That wasn't very nice of you. At least you could have told us! That's not very friendly! Sorry. It was all so sudden, and I was getting ready for this ball. Those fancy duds don't suit you, anyway. Put on some wild pirate gear like you used to... ...and let's set sail. Here. We brought you some clothes. Sorry. Cap'n? That Larkham is out of control. He and his bunch are going to swallow up Cordonia. Only I can stop them. -You mean that? Yes! And what about them? They were pirate victims. You saved them, and they joined in the pirate trade with you. And these two. Cast adrift in a crate as babies, crying as they floated along... ...till you took them in. You're a mother to them! And you'd abandon them? No! I'want to go on saving people. The people of this land! Not just from the pirates... ...but from their own Prime Minister! Listen, Anne... ...a queen takes the whole country, good and bad... ...on her own shoulders. Not just Larkham, but Spain, France, England... You take on everyone trying to swallow Cordonia. Are you ready for that? Allright! If that's how it has to be... Sangria! Anne the Tornado, our Cap'n... ...is the queen. We can hold our heads high. But... Helles! Be a good queen... ...0K? Promise you will! Twill. Cerveza... ...you can have those clothes. They suit you. Cap'n! Don't hang around here. Get going. Yeah. Can you get out? Goemon showed us the way. Don't let the guards see you. Let's go! I'm sorry, Goemon. For settling things with them. Ishould have done that myself. Well, I didn't manage to pull off the job. ‘The job"? Ttold them I'd come and steal you back. Just don't let your choice swallow you up. Twon't. Ah, there you are! I've been looking for you. And here's Count Mongoe! Who? Tam Count Mongoe. admired your intervention. What intervention? Don't be so modest! The dance. You saved the situation. That flamenco rhythm. Imerely set the beat. You two are old friends? He served my late father. Yours, too? He served mine, although I don't remember how. You certainly seem to enjoy helping out fathers. But your father was the late Valiente III! You're really something! Just as I thought, Count Mongoe. And now you will serve Queen Anne? She must walk the path of a queen. She is beyond one such as I. Excuse me. I have a bill to pay. Wait! wish to ask you something... ...that bears on the very survival of Cordonia. That sounds serious. Yes. France and Spain are combining to rid the Atlantic of pirates. They know Cordonia has been using pirates. What? The danger is all the greater with a former pirate on the throne. You will be invited to join in suppressing them. If you do not... ...France will consider Cordonia a sponsor of pirates... ...and declare war. What?! How do you know that? Boscoyne is in league with France. I bring this message from France. But first, wanted to see what kind of person the new queen was. And what do you think? You are a rose! The rose of Cordonia, of Europe... No! A sublime, dazzling rose has bloomed in my heart! 1, Charles, pledge my life... ...for the sake of this rose! Music! Stop! Stop! Forget the singing. This isn't the time. You were talking... ...about suppressing pirates. If you want to preserve your kingdom, you must take part. Evenif those pirates are your old comrades. I can say this now... ...but the next time I come Iwill be the Ambassador of France. Say what? France does not want you to join. They will then invade Cordonia and take it over! That is their intent. And Boscoyne acts as their poodle. Thus we stay free. Some ‘freedom' that is! Anne! What are you doing to do? Well... Are you ready to do what you must? Count Mongoe... ‘Count Mongoe'? Don't make me laugh! He's Ishikawa Goemon, a thief of a pirate! What?! What are you doing here, Desko? Guarding Prince Charles. I figured you'd be at Queen Anne's debut ball. And Iwas right. You make a fine bloodhound. Women fall for you. I can't stand that. Wait! Hey! Goemon, run! You help pirates?! No! Tell the girls to mend their ways... ...or I'll be after them. You're ready to do that? I must, to preserve this land. Tam Anne of Arvida, queen of Cordonial Isee. In that case... What's that? It's what I must do. As of now, I am their protector! Goemon! You are Queen Anne. Iam Ishikawa Goemon, the pirate king! Bring it on!
