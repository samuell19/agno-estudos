♪ They say in life you never know which way the wind will blow. So, who knew that a spring thunderstorm thousands of miles from where I live would change my life forever. ♪ This is where I live. Liberty, Oregon. It's so green here and the air is so fresh. It's, like, impossible for things not to grow here. Smile at the camera, Corey. That's my mom and dad and me when I was, like, a day old. Show the world what a proud papa you are. Except for home movies and photos, I don't remember my mom because she died when I was 1 ½, which is sad because everybody says she was a really special person. The day I was born, my dad planted a tree for me. A Sitka spruce. My dad had to move a giant rock to do it. That's how I got my name. Rock. A Sitka grows a lot in 17 years. Mine sure did. Why do I think my tree is special? Well, it looks awesome, you can see that, but think about it. How many birthday presents, especially ones you get when you're only 1 day old... Are still there 17 years later, bigger and better than ever? That is a pretty special gift, my friends. Well, it's better to give than to receive, right? And this is my gift to you. ♪ Hey, Belinda. Corey, hey. It's for Rock. Sign by the X. So, you trying to fix him up again? Here. Gloria's coming for Thanksgiving. It's a lost cause. I gave up trying hitting on this man years ago. You're married, Belinda. Yeah, and don't remind me. Hey, and don't take all of Eddie's money tomorrow night. Hi, Belinda. Okay, would you stop growing, for crying out loud? Are you trying to make me feel old? See you, boys. Well, I'm late. Sorry. We managed without you but you have to remember-- Uh-oh, I hear a teachable moment coming on. If you worked for someone else, being late would have consequences. Your pay could be docked, you could lose your job. Yeah, but who would fire a great kid like me? Ugh. I'll be on time tomorrow. Got a dolly out back. How was school? Boring. Some things don't change. ♪ That's hilarious, Ash. The Gold Rush, right? Bollywood style. Hey guys, it rained in Shanghai today. We haven't had rain in weeks. You should come to Liberty, dude. Always rains here. And you must come to China, Rock. And Mumbai. Oh, I will, dudes. I totally will. Do you have a movie for us, Rock? Yeah, a little animated thing I'm working on. Hey, umm, I got a stack of catalogues today from college counselling. The Film Studies program at University of Oregon sounds kind of cool. I'm looking at that school too. I think I might, you know, come up for a tour in the spring. Me too. We should, like, coordinate and do that together. Yeah, that would be awesome. Count me in too, guys. Hi, Rock. Faith Russell. I sent you a certified letter telling you I was coming. Post Office tracking said you signed for it. Letter? Yeah. Well, we tried e-mailing you but they all bounced back. Did you change your e-mail address? Ah, yes. I was getting a lot of spam. Look, is there something I can-- Help you with, ma'am? Oh, hi. Faith Russell, Box Of Toys. You must be Rock's father. Did I get a certified letter? Yeah, yesterday. I put it on your dresser. I didn't see it. Oh, so you don't know. Know what? Your tree. Your Simka. Sitka. It won. It's our new national tree. It won? Mm-hmm. Congratulations. My tree won? Yeah. Woo! He seems happy. After you. The previous national tree had been there for almost 100 years. It was a popular DC landmark but it was hit and destroyed by lightning last March and there wasn't enough money left in this year's park service budget, so we signed on to find a new tree, bring it to DC and plant it all on our own nickel. The contest to pick the tree, I read about it on Facebook. It was a great submission, Rock. I did this cool video. It was so funny and touching. So, let me see if I understand this. You want to uproot the tree, put it on the back of a truck, drive it across country and plant it at the White House? Across the street from The White House in the ellipse. And then the day after Thanksgiving, to kick off the holidays, we'll decorate it to the nines and the president himself will turn on the lights. The president? Dad, how cool is that? So, you want to buy the tree? No, there is a $5,000 cash prize, but... You can't actually put a value on a tree like this. It's priceless, which is why we want it to be our national tree so we can share it with the world. And how are you going to transport it, keep it alive, along the way? A licenced arborist will supervise and a team of professionals will drive it cross-country. It'll be in good hands. And you can't find a tree back east? We could but this is our first choice and, well, this is my project and I'm based in Portland, so I think there is a wee bit of regional pride happening here. I don't know. Dad, this is awesome. I get to go to Washington, right? Absolutely. We'll fly you out, put you up. You'll be right there when the lights go on. What about school? It'll be Thanksgiving week, I'll be on break. We'll think about it. Think about it? There's nothing to think about. I'm not sure how comfortable I am with the idea. You don't have to be comfortable with this. It's my tree, remember? Isn't that what you always say? "I planted this tree for you, Rock." You planted it for me, didn't you? We'll talk about it, Rock. You know, your dad's right. It's a big decision. So, look, I'm staying at the Liberty Pines B&B. Let me know when you've decided. But I will need to know by tomorrow morning. We do have a tree back East, a Douglas fir in Bethel, Maine. And if this isn't going to work out, we'll just move to plan B. I can let myself out. ♪ Why did you do that? Rock, a tree is a delicate thing, a living thing. A trip like that, clear across the country, they don't know what they're doing, they could kill it. How do you know they don't know what they're doing? Well, she called it a Simka, for one thing. You always do this. You always say no. That is not true. This is my chance to get out of here. This is my chance to do something cool, to meet the president. But you don't care about me. All you care about is the tree. Well, shall we offer more money? I don't think it's about the money. I think the father's just really protective of the tree. So, we go to plan B. No, no. Not yet. I mean, I'm here, I've given them until tomorrow morning. Let's just see how it plays out. Whatever you say. It's your baby. Okay, I'll keep you posted. Hi, sweetheart. No, I'm still in Liberty, ironing out details. I can't wait either. How are your mom and dad? Ah, I miss you too. You in, Hank? 5 bucks. See that? And... raise. You're bluffing. Only one way to find out. Well, one of us is. Take it. You know, I think you're out of line on this one, Corey. Eddie's right. It's Rock's tree. He should be able to do whatever he wants with it. Transplanting a tree that big, and 3,000 miles away... It can be done. Look, I understand that it is cool and exciting for Rock that they picked the tree and they want to put it on display in DC, but once that tree is gone from here, it's gone forever. Yeah, well, let's bottom line this. Whose tree is it? Who does it belong to? Who didn't ante? Come on, Corey. It might be an opportunity to spend some time with Rock. Must be tough. What? Well, knowing Rock will be gone soon. He's still got a year and a half. That will go fast. Core's 14, Connor's 12. I'm already thinking about it. You're really cheering me up here, Hank. What are you going to do when he's gone? I do not want to think about that, all right? You really think that tree can be moved? Trees get moved all the time. This one's a little bigger, it's going a little further, sure. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, all right. ♪ Rock? Yeah? You're right. It's your tree. You want to see it planted in DC, then that's your decision, not mine. But I don't want strangers doing it. I'm going to drive it to Washington and I need help. I want you to come with me. But they were going to fly me there. Yeah, well, that's the deal. Take it or leave it. The national tree, Rock? That's awesome. It gets lit the day after Thanksgiving? Is Thanksgiving Day close to Christmas? Not even. But in America, we start putting up Christmas decorations right after Halloween. The thing is, I have to travel with my dad for, like, a week. Ooh, brutal. Yeah. I don't know if I can handle that. I'm thinking about maybe not going. You have to go, Rock. Hey, would you be coming out I-80? I don't know. Because if you are, you'll go straight to Cheyenne, and I'm only, like, 40 miles from there. It'll take us 3 days to get the tree ready, to really pare the root bed and make sure it's viable for transplanting. That doesn't give us a lot of time. We need to be in DC no later than Thanksgiving. That's November 26th. We can do that. My crew and I start this afternoon, we're ready by Friday, that's the 20th. That gives us 6 days to get there. So, are we taking I-80? Yep. We'll stop each night at one of our stores, give people a chance to see the tree. Yeah, maybe, if we have time. We're stopping, Corey. Box of Toys is underwriting this trip. Are we going through Cheyenne? Yeah, we're stopping there the second night. So, when do we leave? Looking forward to hitting the road with the old man, huh? Ah, father and son on a journey across America together, delivering our national tree to our nation's capital. As a marketing rep, I can work with that. I can definitely work with that. Friday morning, November 20th. My Sitka's about ready to see the world. Or America, at least. We go through Oregon. Then Idaho. Then once we pick it up, it's pretty much the I-80 all the way. First stop, Salt Lake City, Utah, home of the Mormons and other things. The next night, Cheyenne, Wyoming, where the historic Rock/Katie face-to-face meeting will happen. I'm excited about that. Then it's Omaha, NE. Chicago, IL, my kind of town. Grove City, Pennsylvania. And finally, Washington DC. Let's kick it. That's a great root bundle there, Hank. As long as I don't fall off the tree, right? And you've got to love that banner. Box of Toys knows an advertising opportunity when it sees one, although they might have measured it first to fit the tree. Hank's Ebert and Roeper today. Eddie, make sure the front strap's secure. Ah, bungee cords, the miracle rope. They can hold down anything. And the final piece of the puzzle, our fearless companion. Love the sign. Wouldn't have been my first choice for a vanity plate. You're bringing that camera with you? Just for my friends. You know, the road, DC. Right. Could we link it up with the company website? We have a national tree page. Sure. Cool.

He watched the 2 of them grew up together. But since Stephie passed, I think he's been doing his duty but he hasn't opened his heart. Anyway, did you know that he used to cut down trees? Corey did? Mm-hmm. Controlled thinning to prevent wildfires, protect the ecosystem. Next to Rock, the forest was his passion. So, why doesn't he do that anymore? Well, to be there for Rock. But you know what? Before you know it, Rock's going to be gone. All you have to do is check his vlog to know that he is a citizen of the world. He's going to say goodbye to Liberty and never look back. ♪ If I can get your picture, that would be just great. Yeah, this is going on the internet. Got to go. It was really nice to meet you.

That was pretty dumb. I know, but-- That's okay. Love can make us do crazy things. Love? Who said anything about love? You know, Rock and I hang out online, like, all the time and it's really cool. We talk and we laugh, rent all the same things, but I was scared to meet him because up close and personal, guys can be kind of-- Disappointing? Yeah, but Rock, he isn't disappointing at all. He's-- Majorly cool? Majorly. So, you just weren't thinking. It's okay. When we're in love, we're all capable of that. Just what were you thinking? She could've been killed riding back there. I messed up. Rock, why would you do something like this? I wanted her to come to Washington with us. I told you, no. There's no reason for her not to be with us. You can't just say no and not give me a reason. Rock, she is not coming to Washington. Neither am I. Where are you going? Buy Katie breakfast, figure out how we're going to get home. ♪ Hey. Hey. You're right to be angry. They did a stupid thing. But you've got a great son. Think I don't know that? Rock is an amazing kid, I just need him to listen to me, otherwise I can't keep him safe. And have you told him that? I don't need to tell him that. He knows that. Maybe he doesn't. Do you really want to go to Washington without him? Well, that's his choice. Look, I know it's none of my business, but Rock wants to be there when they light that tree more than anybody, and instead he's standing by his girl, and I respect him for that. Oh, there's your dad. Here we go. Your parents know you're here? Yeah. I mean, they didn't know about the back of the truck thing. Well, I'm going to need to touch base with them. From here on out, you can ride up front with Rock and myself. Or with Faith. Should be a little more comfortable. Thanks. Thanks, Dad. Finish up. We need to get going. Yee-haw! Here we go. Let's kick it. Thanks for tuning in, vlogophiles. Welcome to Rock's incredibly epic cross-country vlog. So, as you know, after my dad busted our bonehead stowaway scheme, the way-cool Katie emerges from behind the curtain and becomes a full-fledged member of our motley crew. Say cheese. Uh, no. Say it!

Every town we passed by, more and more people came to see us. We had fans. ♪ It was pretty mind blowing for little old me, the country bumpkin from Liberty, to see Chicago, the city of the big shoulders. I totally loved it. But the fans. Oh man, the fans. They just totally loved the tree, and it has to be said, with all due modesty, they totally loved the Rockster. But if you're worried that all this attention has gone to my head or something, don't. I have a 24/7 reality check travelling with me. ♪ What's your name? Excuse me. Excuse me, Rock. Could you tell us what's going through your head as you go across the country? Uh, well, uh, I love that people are into the tree. We get it everywhere we go and it's amazing, it really is. We never expected it'd be like this. Well, good luck to you. Thank you. Okay, so after a warm welcome in Chicago, the Burdocks hit the Hoosier State for a short period of time before moving on to Washington DC. All the attention we're getting adds a whole level of coolness to something that is already pretty awesome. But it hasn't been all media events and White Line Fever. There's been times for some serious chillaxing. Ah, karaoke, the great equalizer. It makes everyone look ridiculous. But even in party mode, we never forgot about our payload.

I want to thank you for selecting Rock's tree to be the national tree and for giving up your own Thanksgiving plans to help us get it here safely. Thanks, Corey. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. ♪ It's a good year. Oh. Sorry, that's me. I'll just be one minute. Hello? Yeah, this is Jim O'Connor, Miss Russell, the NPS ranger coordinating the tree lighting ceremony. Happy Thanksgiving. Oh, thank you. You too. Listen, I won't keep you. I just wanted to confirm that we'll be there at 8:00 a.m. to escort the tree to the ellipse. That's the plan. Good, 'cause they're going to start setting up the stand at 9:00. Stand? Yeah, then the chainsaw crew arrives at noon. What are you talking about? It's going to be a bear getting that tree into the stand. I have enough trouble with just a 6 footer at home. But we're planting the tree. Uh, no, ma'am, we're just erecting it. No, that's not what-- That's not what we're doing. We're planting the tree. Well, those aren't my instructions, ma'am, not anymore. Look, if we have some crossed wires here, talk to Aaron Sprague. He authorized this. Aaron, it's Faith. There must be some kind of a misunderstanding. I just talked with Park Services and they're talking about erecting the tree and not planting it. And they're saying that you authorized it, but that can't be right. So, will you call me when you get this message? Hey. Hey, have you seen Faith? I was going to ask you. She's not in our room and her car's gone. Mr. Burdock. Yeah. Jim O'Connor, real pleasure to meet you, sir. You too. This is my son, Rock. Katie. Rock. Katie. Well, you ready to take this beauty to the ellipse? Let's do that. Right, follow me. ♪ All right, then. Good work. Thank you. Aaron. Faith. I've left you 10 messages since last night. Why didn't you call me back? Oh, what's the matter? You seem upset. You authorized the tree to be erected in a stand instead of plant it? Well, I didn't. Corporate did. You didn't think to tell me this? Look, Corporate is over the moon about the tree. Nationwide sales have gone through the roof, all thanks to you. But why aren't we planting the tree? Well, I mean, they saw how much excitement the tree generated and they thought, "Why plant it when we can do this again next year? Every year." They're already putting together a series pitch, kind of an "Amazing Race" thing, 4 or maybe 6 trees all competing to get to DC. They? Who's "They"? Marketing. Marketing? Well, I'm not crazy about the idea and I weighed in with that but-- You and I are Marketing, so I am telling you that Corey Burdock does not want that tree to be cut. I know and I feel as bad about this as you do but... It's out of our hands. Either we plant that tree or... I quit. Rock, it's me, Faith. Call me as soon as you get this message and if you haven't delivered the tree yet, don't. Don't do this, Faith. You'll regret it. Don't do this, Faith. Mr. Burdock, I'll need your signature right here. Okay, so Capital buildings, Smithsonian, an hour there. No, 2. Okay, fine, 2. And then the Washington monument, Lincoln Memorial and Vietnam wall-- And the International Spy Museum. We can't miss that. There's an International Spy Museum? Hey, superstar. You want to go talk to your public and then we'll go get something to eat? This is unbelievable. Excuse me. What is that? That's the stand for the tree. Stand for--? They're not planting the tree. I know, they told me last night. I've been trying to call. Last night? Why didn't you tell me? I thought it was a mistake. You let me bring the tree here and you knew they were going to cut it? I came in early to straighten things out. I trusted you, Faith. I believed you. This is a mistake. You can't cut down the tree. I told you, ma'am, I have my instructions. Look, we're not staying for the lighting. What? They are not going to plant the tree. They're going to stick it in a stand, they're going to cut it. Well, tell them they can't do that. I can't, I just-- I signed it over to them. They're still going on with the ceremony, right? The lighting? Of course, it's on national television. I want to be here. You want to stand up in front of the world and to watch them celebrate the lighting of your dead tree? Yeah, that's why we came here. So that they could kill it? The tree that we nurtured for 17 years? No, I-- Rock, this is your tree, Rock. I know-- We drove it across the country together to keep it alive. What is important to you, Son? What do you care about? He won't budge. He says his orders come from the commissioner and he has to follow them. I'm going back to the hotel. I'm not watching this. Corey, please.

Hi, Rock. It's Grandma. Hi, Grandma. I just wanted to let you know that we're all going to be watching tonight when they light the tree. Ooh, and guess what?

I'll talk to you soon, honey. Thanks, Grandma. Rock? What is wrong with me? I'm, like, the biggest jerk that ever lived. My dad's right, we can't let them kill the tree. We have to stop them. But it's too late. No, it isn't. Look, he loves you, Corey. He heard you, and he needs your help. What's going on? Come on, let's go. Oh, I am so getting you a cell phone to Christmas. Hey, everybody! Hello, Washington. Let's get this thing started. Oh, oh. Hi, sorry about this. We'll be as quick as possible. Why, what's going on? Uh, it's a final media op before the tree goes up. Media op? Yeah. Hey, you're going to be on Channel 4. How sweet is that? Channel 4? Well, I love Channel 4. So what do you think? We need some footage with the tree before the tree goes up. Please, can we roll this along? Thank you very much. Thank you so much, you're so kind. Hey, fellows. How's it going? Good. Hey guys, this shouldn't take long at all. Beautiful day. Good. No!

Why are you up there? Why have you cuffed yourself to the tree? Well, my dad planted this tree to celebrate... me... and life. It's good to celebrate life. It's important. My dad always said that this is my tree and it was, but not anymore. This is America's tree now. And I want it to live. I want the President to look out of the window of the oval office every morning and see a living thing, not just some hunk of wood we're going to trash when we're done with it. I want everyone who visits Washington from America and all over the world to see it and to understand that in its own funny way, this tree is America. It may not be perfect, but it's strong, it's alive, it's here to stay. So, we need to nurture it, protect it, just like we need to nurture and protect each other. All right, let's break this up. This is a restricted area. You're trespassing. Vacate the property or you will be arrested. Can't. Where's the key? Don't remember. Cut him loose. Don't you dare. Step away from the tree, sir. Arrest us if you have to but we're not moving. Not willingly. Me neither. And me. You've got to be kidding me. Vacate the premises now. You're trespassing on federal property. Save our tree! Our national tree! Save our tree! Here at the ellipse, the angry crowd is now fully behind the Burdocks and their mission to save the national tree. Tensions have been rising throughout the day as more people arrived to join this growing protest. You'll see behind me some of the signs that we've seen throughout - "Rock's tree is tops." And a few minutes ago we heard from Rock who said he is not leaving this tree. He wants it planted in the ground, he wants it beside The White House so that the president can look out at that tree every day and see it. Yes, Mr. President? What?! Umm, yes, sir. Of course, sir. I understand. I will. You have a terrific Christmas too, sir. That was the president. He said... He said when he looks out his window every day, he wants to see a living tree.
