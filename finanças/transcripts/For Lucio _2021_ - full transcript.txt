Beppe Caschetto and Rai Cinema present an IBC Movie production in collaboration with Avventurosa with the support of Regione Emilia-Romagna with the support of Regione Lazio Regional Fund for Cinema and Audiovisuals in collaboration with a film by Pietro Marcello FOR LUCIO Dear Tobia, you were with Lucio for many years. Were you always his manager? No, I began in 1966 when he came into the restaurant Cesari. And said to me, "Tobia, I need to talk to you because I need a manager. Because I'm not happy with the one I have..." I said, "I've never been a manager". "I trust you." And then he said... He left. He was wearing a bike helmet. I hadn't even recognized him. Then he came back and said, "Tobia, I forgot to tell you something. I'm broke". My first concert was in Gallipoli. I remember that at the entrance it said, "man", and a price "woman", another price. There were lots of people dancing so I went to get the money. Panic. I went to this guy, one of the organizers, and told him, "Listen. Let's count the money". "I have no money." "But the venue is full. How can you say that? You signed a contract, I set off from Bologna, for you to tell me, 'Good morning'? I don't think so. We need to fix that." So, what did I do? I quickly stole his and his friend's Rolexes. Both their watches. And then I told him, "Tomorrow I'll be at Hotel Plaza in Taranto." Another Carnival party. "If you bring the money, I'll give back the Rolexes. Otherwise, I'll keep them." I'm happy to have had this night as my debut with Lucio. And so she was left alone in the room The room overlooking the port Her only clothes what she had on And the days shorter and shorter And though she didn't know his name Or what country he was from She awaited me like a gift of love From that first month on Lucio told me to go to his house. I rang the bell and his mother opened the door. Lucio hadn't arrived yet, or wasn't there, I don't remember anymore. His mother asked me, "So you're Tobia, the manager? Of what? My son's manager? Manager of what? He must find a job, and he must study. He needs to stop acting like a clown. You understand?" As the old adage says, 'There is only one mother'. It's true. I remember that time with great delight. - What is happening? - It's a mother with a problem. - A problem? - Her son has a beard. I'm so sorry. Do you want me to make it disappear? - I wish. - You'd be happy? - The happiest. - Only the beard? - Does he have long hair, too? - He does. Long hair, too! Maybe you need a barber rather than a magician. I'd love that. Look, we have a fantastic singer we'll soon introduce, who has a beard and long hair and yet, he's liked by many. - What's your name, madam? - Dalla. Dalla? But... - Our singer is Dalla, too. - So strange. - Where are you from? - Bologna. He's from Bologna, too! Where do you live? Does he have a beard? - He does. - Then, it's him. It's him! Of course! Lucio Dalla, here he is! Come here, Lucio. You don't want your son to have a beard? But it's so nice. She was the first who gave a beard to me. Oh, it was you? You could act in a film based on the Bible. Or on the Risorgimento. - He vaguely resembles... who? - Garibaldi. Anyone from the Risorgimento era. He sings well, though, madam. - I like it. - You do? That's bad... You must be happy, right? - Is that good for you? - Very good. Alright, do you want to dedicate a nice song to her? It's not exactly fitting. It's called "When I was a soldier". Your mother is not exactly a soldier. It fits well with today's theme: silence. Madam, you will be escorted... Lucio was called by Zecchino d'Oro to sing a song. And he brought his mother. He always used to invite his mother, but she'd never go because, and I think she was right, she'd say, "I don't want to embarrass him while he's working. There will be other occasions". And that was an occasion because it wasn't a concert, just one song. That was the first time I saw Lucio with his mother at the Antoniano. And I remember a detail. She slipped. It was also shown on TV. And then, the camera panned away and she was helped up. Everything went well. It was a lovely night. His mother would make him the clothes and the purses he used. She'd make a lot of things, and, to Lucio, she was very important. Family first. His father died when he was six. All his affection went to his mother. His mother would always stand by him even though... initially, she changed her mind later on, initially she was like any other mother at that time. They were obsessed with finding a stable job for their children. But that wasn't a stable job. The director of this program decided to compare some of the candidates who came for the audition, and who weren't always well-prepared, with personalities who have had a great success which is still current and valid. One of them is Lucio Dalla. Hello. I'm very glad to have you as our guest. Because you're one of the few people with a very solid musical background. You have a top-notch jazz background. Yes, I started out as a clarinet player. Initially as an amateur and then as a professional. Where did you use to play? My first band was based in Bologna, it was called the Reno Jazz Gang. Then, I moved to Rome and played with the Second Roman New Orleans for two years, as a clarinettist. I didn't sing back then. It wasn't in my plans. I see. How come you left the jazz scene? A big reason was that it wasn't economically viable. I literally needed to eat. I was 17 or 18 in a city that wasn't my hometown. I would often starve and sleep on the streets. I think I was a predecessor of the hippie culture because I had no place to sleep. But the main reason was that I had already noticed, and lately even more so, that there was a large gap between the music I used to make and the recipient of my music: the audience. After all, jazz is a biologically unknown language. It's a type of music that we can only perceive intellectually. We can love it, but we can't understand it. - We can't make it ours. - We can't transfer it. Jazz is the technical background that I use to express myself and make music that is not underground and that deals with issues that are Mediterranean, - almost folkloric. - I see. Day after day Sun after sun I've never reckoned How far I've walked When I look around I don't realize Whether I'm in Rome Or a foreigner, I am here I watch the river and the city I watch the water, and watch within me Everything is rushing forward but where does it go? The river, the ocean, then I don't know Roads and alleys, then I don't know One always leaves but never arrives Never I followed a shadow But it was my own Like a challenge It was always ahead of me On the long journey The faces I saw I now realize All look like me Lucio always did what he felt like doing. And I must say, he was right. Because when I started there were many people who didn't believe in him. Many would say, "What do you think you're doing, following Lucio and all that..." And yet... Tobia won. Lucio tried everything. He wanted to do everything. And this is good. We all endured poverty, but he would ease that for everyone. Even when he was broke. What do you want from life? Honestly, I don't know yet. I mean, I do, but it's hard to explain. I want many things. I want tranquillity. I want to live problem-free. I want to get along with everyone but at the same time, I don't want all those things. How can you achieve all this? Surely, not by living how I'm living now. With some effort, I think. Is your job hindering the fulfilment of your dreams? Yes, absolutely. But it also gives me great things, like contact with people which is the best part. Being able to talk to a stranger, someone who comes to me and asks, "How are you?" To initiate a conversation, it's important to me. If you weren't a singer, what would you be? A house painter. Why? Just 'cause. Colours fascinate me. White, in particular. With which famous personality would you switch lives? With no one. Because... There's no one... I think what disturbs me is that there are people who follow celebrities... I'd rather swap my life with... With you, for instance. Who is Lucio Dalla? I am. He was one of the few artists who also knew how to live life. It's such a peculiar thing. He knew everything. If I'd mention anything, he'd already know about it. And then he'd let you finish, to make you feel like you were sharing the big news. But he already knew everything. It was impressive. He was so talented. At that time... pretty faces were predominant in the music industry. Morandi, Mal. Lucio, on the other hand, debuted when singer-songwriters were big. When that generation stopped caring about the singers' handsomeness, or the catchy songs. But what the singers said, their words. Since we're many, this evening, I'd like to do something that seems like the right thing to do. Let's sing together. Let's sing together a song that is quite easy, it's called "Ithaca". I'm going to explain it to you. You need to relate, not to Ulysses, the hero that we study in school, but you need to relate to his sailors. Who, for once, are the heroes and protagonists. They oppose Ulysses, almost politically. Ulysses is seen as a thief, a swindler. They tell him, "You travel the world, find princesses in every port. But there's nothing for us. You sleep in beds, we never sleep. Your son is the king's son and won't starve if you die. If we die, as we always do, killed by arrows, drowned, or transformed into pigs, our children will starve to death. So, stop acting like a tourist, and take us home. This is the meaning of this collective song. Captain, your noble destiny Radiates from your eyes But you never think of the sailor Who has neither bread nor wine Captain, you have always found Damsels in every port Yet you never consider the man at the oars Whose wife thinks he's lost at sea Ithaca Ithaca Ithaca That is my only home Ithaca Ithaca Ithaca I want to go back home From the sea From the sea From the sea I would have never believed, if I had thought about it, that I'd end up with someone like Lucio. You know, he was... I saw the legend in him, when he was nobody. With all the hardship he endured, he was an exceptional man because he was self-made. We interrupt this broadcast To announce that On this night of calm And peace and love The body of a man has been discovered Dead A truly Unusual Exceptional thing because It had been twenty years In our pleasant world Ours Since a man had died Without his body being found Our teams Of TV reporters Fanned out In a part of the region of Piemonte At the foot of the mountain, naturally They interviewed The farmer The shepherd The labourer... In short The man who found the body Please excuse in advance How emotional he is This freak event has really rattled the man However Our reporter Whom we thank for having... cut short His holiday His Christmas with the family Pumpkin pie still on his fork, he rushed here To interview him "The body was hidden by branches covered by stones, covered in dirt" "The body was hidden by branches covered by stones, covered in dirt" "It was hidden by branches covered by stones, covered in dirt" "It was hidden by branches covered by stones, covered in dirt" "The eyes!" The eyes The eyes I didn't see the eyes They were hidden by branches They were black with dirt They were green like the forest His hair His hair No, I couldn't see his hair His hair was red with blood Covered in mud and dust Like feathers from plucked birds The mouth I couldn't see the mouth It was filled with dirt And covered with branches and stones And the lip was split. No The mouth was silent Lucio had a dear friend whom, sadly, I need to mention. He was always with Renzo Cremonini. A very delightful person. Crucial in Lucio's life. He was his producer, along with others. You know how it is in the music world. One makes a song and becomes producer of that song. I must say something very important about Cremonini. I don't know if many people know this. He's the one who introduced Roversi to Lucio. If the mountains were all sowed with grain If packs of horses returned to the plains Flying through the flowers and the grasses As I told my tales of love I would still be just twenty As the geese fly on But the snow is falling on my hands And my horse is far away by now Night and fog are in its eyes My weapon lies across my knees My bow and arrow unused As the geese fly on Where the river meets the sea The water is a race of light Flood me with a single smile If the mountains are all forest And the streets whipped by tempests I will stop my flight I can tell the tale of my past life And will be able to wait for you As the geese fly on Roversi wasn't a socialite. He'd stay home and would send the lyrics. I think he didn't want to be involved in the music industry. He was... I can describe him like the type... His life was his brain. I've always said that. He had everything in there. He'd articulate beautifully. As long as you didn't talk about money to him. You'd suggest some lyrics to him, "This song here, what if we wrote lyrics everyone can understand? You know, we could..." Ambiguity in lyrics? Roversi wouldn't fall for that. You'd ask him for some lyrics, he'd write them, and that was that. Then it was up to you, through music, to turn it into a masterpiece. He's left a strong impression on me. However, we weren't very close. Being close to Roversi wasn't easy because he was a taciturn man, he kept to himself, he didn't want to disturb anyone. I would often see him in one of Via Marconi's side streets in Bologna, waiting for the bus. I'd stop and ask him, "Roberto, are you going anywhere? Do you want me to drive you?" He would always turn me down. He was always with his wife. He was a person... Just talking about him now, I feel like... There are no longer any men like him. Roberto Roversi, you were born in Bologna in 1923. Compared to the city of your childhood, what has changed in present-day Bologna? Surely many things, but what do you think is the most striking change? The Bologna of my childhood was a rural town, at the head of a rural culture and society. Now, this society has gone. It was rapidly destroyed in a terrifying cultural genocide in the 1950s, and it hasn't been replaced with anything equally whole and stimulating. The Bologna of my childhood had sounds, smells, noises typical of the countryside. There were scents. You could track the business seasons through the scents in the air. The hemp season, the grape harvest, the time when the people would store the castellata, which was an established amount of grapes, in the cellar stored in a special barrel that was carried by oxen from the countryside to the city. Now, that bond with the territory, with the smells, is gone. Bologna has become a regular, post-industrial city. Or better, a downright industrial city of our times. Tobia, who was Roversi for Lucio? Roversi was everything. Thanks to his collaboration with Roversi, Lucio learned to write songs. Dear Roberto, it's 4 am and I've finished the album. You taught me everything: to be respectful and strong at the same time. Roversi was a fine intellectual. He was incorruptible. He had his beliefs. Right or wrong, it's not up to me to judge. I admired him for this. For his positions. And because he didn't do things for money. The Mille Miglia was the greatest open-road race of all times. It took place in Italy between 1927 and 1957. The Mille Miglia was born to demonstrate the legitimacy of cars. It became the major advertising medium in a transformation process that rapidly changed the country's reality. Rural Italy was painfully losing its social and cultural identity. The last cars left Before the glow of dawn The air full of dust and burning rubber from the tires All of Italy is awake In Bologna, Arcangeli is in the lead In Rome, it's Nuvolari Arcangeli has engine problems And behind the barriers the crowd goes wild The Alfas are in first and second place in Rome. In Terni they refuel Varzi leaves Nuvola in second place The dust is so thick in the air You can barely make out the ferocious race Over Radicofani it looks like lightning In the halls of an ancient castle Three hundred curves and death seems near With the stench of fuel and burning tires Clear the way. On the second pass of the road to Bologna Varzi's Alfa is still ahead But fierce Nuvolari is gunning behind him Flashing his lights to get out of his way Now Nuvola is savoring his win With dazzling Varzi number two Arcangeli and Campari both withdrew All champions famous the world over In Rome, the crowd awaits while the battle for victory is about to start. That's Ingrid Bergman waiting for Rossellini. It was an epic race The Mille Miglia of 1947 Over lush green Umbria Gesu's ribcage filthy from love It was the roughest Most heart-pounding ever Part symphony, part crucifixion A wild adventure in rain and fear A real massacre, an ancient rite Houses and ruins, a wild tempest Nuvolari, you're a black cloud In a clear sky Destroyer of the spring As you swing your hammer challenging fate But if it's death you are after It's not you who will die Flying man of Mantova White hot from the speed Driving a Cisitalia 1100 Not caring if he lives or dies You're a little Buster Keaton racing for victory Trees fell like dominoes as the cars flew by All Italy's blood pressure through the roof As the champions entered the straightaway Like a flash of lightning too fast to see Nuvolari, you are a white cloud now Destroyer of the spring in the pristine sky Openly defying fate But if it's death you're after It's not you who will die In an open car Like a harpooned dolphin The steering wheel worn through the veneer He flies through Bologna Like a silent gale The crowd holds its breath Nuvolari and Carena finish second in Brescia Two minutes behind Biondetti who takes first Dirty as a dog Speeding barefaced Like an arrow through the Po Valley Tobia, what do you miss most about Lucio? Everything. I miss the person I shared forty-six years of my life with. I had great fun. Through him, I received, maybe more than I deserved. That's life. Today, dear Stefano, is a good day for me. Because rarely, in our lives, you and I have shared a meal together. - Never just the two of us. - Never just the two of us. I came here because you're the only one who can remember Lucio's past even better than I can. And this makes me very happy. Because I've never said a thing about "the spider". - No, it's not that. - Who nicknamed him "Spider"? - I did. - Why? But he renamed me "Bonkers". - I remember. - Because, for Lucio, if you do ordinary things, you're crazy. And so he called me "Bonkers". - Why did you call him "Spider"? - And I said, "You're a spider". Why? Because he was small and hairy. Did you find him handsome? Well, that's not for me to say. - He was normal. - What do you mean "normal"? - Thank you. - Enjoy. A nice chat and some pasta. What do you mean "normal"? Was he? You know, he was beautiful as a kid. When he was 7 or 8, he was so cute. He'd play in musicals, - he'd sing. - At La Ribalta. He'd sing and had all the girls. He'd dress up like a bullfighter. I was younger, and my mother would take me there. When I was a child, I was so jealous of his costumes. He'd sing with the girls. Then he got uglier over time. So much so that his mother, Iole would say, "Lucio, "Lucio, I'll give you 500 liras if you leave. You're too ugly". - No! - That's what she'd say. The thing is, Stefano, we could say that puberty betrayed him. That's what. That's true. To me, Lucio was... He wasn't ugly, he was interesting. He got posher over time. Initially, he was unstylish. Wearing a beret. Then, there followed a period when he was bald and didn't care. One day I saw him with hair, and I thought it was fake, I said, "Did you buy it at the shop?". He said, "What? I went to Cesare Ragazzi. It cost a fortune!" The latest years, he got even posher wearing a waistcoat. All dressed up. - Yes. - He progressively... He was... However... This is part of life. One makes choices. And... He was a little posh. Tobia... you're making me laugh because you're trying to act wise. What I've learned, in terms of life experience, from my youth with Lucio is to pay attention to all the world's anomalies. From things to people. How can I put it... A love for life in all its forms, which is rare. Without any prejudice or initial inhibition. He would... How can I put it... He'd let life flood him. And what might look like a passive approach paradoxically, turned into the ability to give back through his songs and the way he lived life... - Right. - Randomly. Without making plans. Somehow, Lucio was always sucked into things. But... After all... Lucio was trashy. He just didn't know. He didn't know he was trashy. He was fascinated by certain people. - And knowing Lucio... - It's what I'm saying. - He was easily seduced. - It was shocking. Lucio was seduced, and then became a seducer but, initially, he was seduced by life and by people. And he wouldn't rank them. There was no hierarchy. The last of the lowlifes would attract him even more than the first of the most fortunate. However, he'd hardly hang out with them. - He'd hardly hang out with them. - With whom? With those people. The lowlifes? Well, I don't know how to call them. He truly had a passion for the odd ones, the nut jobs. For unique individuals... For you, too. You're not normal, you know. Is it true you're the son of artists? No, it's not. Absolutely not. My mother was a seamstress. My father managed a skeet shooting facility and traded oil. He was an artist as a shooter and my mother as a seamstress. Is it true you were a child prodigy? This is true. I was a child prodigy. When I was 3, I used to sing and dance. I'd do magic tricks. And I would play the part of a child prodigy. When I was 15, I quit for obvious reasons I was no longer a child nor a prodigy. What memories do you have of your debut? My memories are pleasant because there was a delicious taste of failure. I had fun. You were, and are, my friend. You remember. I was the least played artist, the most hated. The least understood. Assuming there was anything to understand which there wasn't. My physique was different from everybody else. I had long hair and was much bigger. I was much shorter. Last year I even got taller. I was completely different. Of those years, what sticks to me is the abyss between me and the people. Lots of doors were shut in my face. But I'd enter from the chimneys, from the TVs, and they couldn't help but see me and listen to me. It was like committing emotional violence. I love my job. I loved it and I still do, for more serious reasons, or equally serious, but, back then, I did it because I felt rejected. The sun rises over the mountains And I have reached Milano City of plenty and miracles of the Madonna The sun sets over the mountains I barely have the strength to look at my own hands The sun rises over the mountains I'm being hunted in the countryside The sun sinks into the water If only a saint would help me I end up thrown into a grotto The sun rises over the mountains Stabbed in the chest I'm left to die Poor worker, poor shepherd, poor farmer The sun rises over the mountains And I am dead and buried The sun rises over the mountains Another man has already taken my job His meeting with Roversi was a reciprocal epiphany. Lucio fell in love with Roversi, not romantically, and Roversi with Lucio, because he felt that instant creative vitality in him. It was really a sort of symbiosis between an intellectual writer and a truly talented person. If you think that Lucio couldn't read the music. He played jazz without knowing the music. He rented a piano and, in a week, he could play anything in C. On the other hand, he found the shape of the words for his music. And that was a period... They weren't very successful at that time, Lucio and Roversi. They were successful in theatres. He had struggled to get signed by RCA. Roversi never followed Lucio in his concerts. No. It was really a gift without expecting anything in return. It wasn't an exchange. It was a fusion of talents. From afar. That too. It is eight in the evening When the first red flag appears Over the walls of the FIAT plant There's a new September in the old September And it falls apart and takes all life with it The ancient pain that won't go away In Genoa, Milan, and Turin a key opens destiny It is nine in the evening When a second red flag appears Over the walls of the FIAT plant The people have flooded the streets They don't want to wait The people are fed up They don't feel like talking The old rage has broken open the day And grows terrible and ordered It is ten in the evening When a fourth red flag appears Above the walls of the FIAT plant - Were you disoriented? - I was. Initially, I was. I wanted to cry. All this heavy machinery stacked up. And that deafening noise. During my first days here, in such a big environment, I felt quite uneasy. However... Actually, I thought about leaving FIAT. - And you? - I had worked in a very small industry with only three workers. I came from the countryside, and arriving in this big environment made me feel uneasy. However, in a short time, thanks to my colleagues' little pranks, pulling pranks was common practice, we called them 'army pranks', and, somehow, I adjusted to the environment. Was it worse than you had thought? Neither better nor worse. Just different. Was there a more serious, sweeter, more dignified, more beautiful person than that man? I was very charmed by Roversi. Because he was an honest man. And that's rare. Everything he'd say, whether you liked it or not, was a form of honesty and truth. He had skills in writing and thinking. He followed his own ethics in thinking. He had his style. What is wonderful about Roversi is his style. Lucio didn't have a soul, didn't have style. He'd become everyone else's soul. He'd possess them. He was a sort of gentle bird of prey. I said, the contract had been finalized on the 30th. The day when, having received the green light, I could relay the news to the public. In fact, I had signed the contract on the 24th, but until the 30th, I was not authorized to consider the deal finalized, because I hadn't yet received from Tripoli the message relaying the green light from the Libyan government. Good morning, thank you, Mr. Agnelli I am from the Manchester Guardian I won't waste your time This is my first question How do you square this circle? You say Taylorism is obsolete But then vote Mirafiori And once again fill the trains with immigrants It's not a flock of sparrows you're unleashing But an exodus from the poor South Leaping at the chance to decentralize production Very well, Mr. Agnelli Your English is impeccable I've duly noted your remarks Through my clenched teeth It's obvious that Agnelli... let me finish. Agnelli made a deal, economically and politically, and so did Gaddafi. But I don't want to talk about Gaddafi. The deal was made with his capital in mind, within FIAT's monopoly. But it doesn't go beyond his monopoly. The working class won't benefit from it at all. Agrobusiness Alimont, down five or fifty. Whoa! Buton, good God, down by ten Bon. Ferraresi Motta, Eridania, Zuccheri Roma and forty five others Cement sector: Eternit, Italcementi, Unicem Down ninety, up thirty, up eleven more Real estate: Condotte d'Acque, up by nine Le Gilardini, seventy nine Risanamento, up by thirty Coge, Coge, Coge, eighteen Certosa sixty Beni Stabili up twenty, up twenty Breaking news For 48 hours, a man who lost his mind due to the stock market crash, terrorized the Milan Stock Exchange. His relentless sequence of crazed buying and selling has caused three coups in Central America, the suicide of a high ranking Japanese official, and the merging of six out of the Seven Sisters in a new cloistered order. Tobia, do you remember the times when Lucio was the happiest? I would see Lucio's happiness when he'd feel fulfilled through his albums. When he was convinced, and no one else, that he'd made a masterpiece, that's when he was very happy. How would he show happiness? He'd hang out with his friends, laughing and joking. He would just be himself. And you know that Lucio was very likeable, when he wanted to. - And quite a lot. - Yeah. - Besides... - One more thing I remember is that as he got richer, he'd take up more space. He'd buy real estate. He'd expand his own house. He expanded from Via D'Azeglio to Piazza Dei Celestini, buying parts of apartments. Must have been seven apartments. He bought a house on Mount Etna. - Two houses on Tremiti Islands. - Yes. That he'd reach with his boat named 'Phlegm' after his love for gross stuff, for foul smells, for disgusting stuff, for excreted stuff. In fact, his intercom would show the name Domenico Sputo, as in spit. He was a world champion in spitting. He'd do crazy stuff. Once, we went to Cantù for a basketball game. Marzorati, captain of the Italian national team, had Lucio try three 3-pointers during the break. Lucio shot them like this. He used to play basketball as a kid. He was nicknamed "Tombolino". He sucked. - He'd shoot with two hands. - Yes. - It was a horrible sight. - But he'd always score. In front of 10,000 people in Cantù he shot three 3-pointers. He was like... Let's put it this way, let's say a word about Lucio: always surprising. He'd never leave you... He'd never meet your expectations. That's the surprise. He'd blow your expectations. You'd expect something, and he'd do something else. He was unpredictable. He'd change all the time. That was his luck. Artistically, physically, and personally. You go out early in the morning Your head racing with thoughts Dodge the traffic and the newspapers Then rush back home, after all today's the same as yesterday No happiness Not even on airplanes or trains Or on a spot lit stage You bow to the crowd up front clapping their hands and cheering No happiness Together in bed but there's no peace Nothing left you can think up Forced even to do yourself harm Just so you can forgive with sweetness And go on Happy Pretend that all across the world There are people who share the same problems Organize a nightly hang For people who are crazy and not that smart Pretend that the whole point of this race Is to make it healthy to the grand finale While Andrea is already ready With a club and his jaws like a shark's Asking you to pay up For the meals served and barely eaten For sleep interrupted, for being forced to steal For having been killed Fifteen times in an alley For fifteen years each Christmas eve For your latest album, you wrote the lyrics, too. And they're quite good. Why didn't you do that before? I didn't because I preferred the lyrics Roversi wrote for me. This time, I wrote my lyrics, especially because, not only I felt the need to say what I felt inside, but also to find an even deeper reason to continue doing this job that was beginning to bore me last year. Doing something new helped find meaning again. She gets off the tram and approaches, dancing a little Mambo She feels clever and cute, says I won't be staying with you longo My heart is shipwrecked but I'm a man and say, You're free to go Take your smile with you and leave me to ease my blues Take away the tatters, your hips, and that Mambo face And your fake happiness That can force a smile from even your last sob You, yes you It's you who never feels afraid I want to come back and find you a little surer My Mambo queen I think I'd rather stay shipwrecked Than have you at my side again You You How did Lucio compose his songs? I remember he had a notepad. When he was around town, or home, he'd start writing. Music would come later... - True. - Most of the time. When he'd ask me if I liked them or not, it was nice debating about it. I have no creativity at all, so, I represented the audience's inertia, regardless of his trust in my judgement. When you find someone so talented, that talent is a little special. It's not just intelligence or sensitivity. It's the ability to pass that sensitivity and intelligence onto others. Lucio wrote beautifully. There are no two songs alike. They evoked extraordinary images, rarely ordinary. Somehow, Lucio had a stronger creative instinct than a propensity for reflection, because he'd use reflection to his advantage. He was cunning. You know him, he'd never give in, he always had to have the final say. - He'd listen to you, though. - Alright, let's say... He'd listen to you because... Listen. It wasn't because you were friends, but because he trusted you. It's different. I met Lucio when I was six. You know, you can't lie to your brother from another mother. In fact, when he'd lie to my face, he knew all too well that I knew it was a lie, but I'd pretend it was all right. And so would he, while telling it. He knew he was lying, but he would pretend he wasn't. He'd pretend I believed the lie. What do you look for in your personal relationships? In my relationships with others I look for... for everything. Or, at least, I look for a lot of things. At times, maybe childishly, I try to find myself in others. It's quite scary because I often look for people like me and this kills me. I find myself in what is completely different from me. If I found someone completely different from me, an individual who's diametrically opposite to me in every sense, also physically, then I'd be attracted to them. Why do you lie? What?! For more than a hundred years At the Luna park Sonny Boy arrives With the painted horses and the Fortune Teller With her metal teeth Black eyes Scanning the mysteries of the sky He was born in Ferrara, no, he was found on a wall He's full of signs, his muscles ripple beneath his skin Sonny Boy has drawn a map of the stars on his arms And hunts each night on his horse for lost souls I also asked for help many times as a little boy How many times have I been lost How many times did I fall and cry Watching the stars I tried to understand How to live in the grown-up world But not be afraid, afraid of dying Like a gypsy sitting on a wall Eyes trained on the future Have you ever stolen from Lucio? - Me? - Yes. If that's what you're implying... What does that mean? I said, have you ever stolen money? In order to steal from Lucio, you had to be an early bird. You know him well, it wasn't easy. He was the only artist who was aware of everything. - He knew everything about everyone. - He was a sleuth. Not with me. He'd rip my invoices. For an artist, and I must say there aren't many like that, as many have been misguided, either due to ignorance or dishonesty. What about him? Not him. Lucio knew everything. You know, all of Lucio's and your friends say that Lucio was luckier to have you than you were to have him. It's not for me to say, but I'm glad you said that. When I was asked to work for Lucio, thanks to you who acted as my sponsor, I can say that the many years I spent with Lucio were happy ones. So, Lucio believed in you - and you believed in Lucio. - Yes. What do you believe in? I believe in mankind. In the possibility of being completely... I believe in love. In absolute love. I believe in the possibility of redeeming oneself. I believe no one should be judged. Basically because I'm a Christian, and I believe in God. Despite its many contradictions. Are you an optimist? I am a believer. A believer can also be a pessimist. But I'm not a pessimist. I'd never sing of a world without disquietude. Dance Dance Ballerino, all night long and in the morning Don't stop dancing On a table set between two mountains, Dance on the waves of the ocean, I'll come watch you Grab the sky with your hands And fly higher than the airplanes Never stop Few years remain, or maybe days They're all stopping in a hurry one by one Not one will ever come back Dance, don't be afraid the night is dark and cold Don't think of the pistol that you're aiming Dance in the light of a thousand cigarettes and the moon That shines on you in the day Dance the mystery Of this world that burns up all that was true yesterday Tell me I'm right, it won't be true tomorrow Stop the Palermo-Frankfurt train with your bare hands The sight of a boy at the window for some reason moves me Green eyes that look like glass Run stop that train and make it turn around They're loaded, let them through. Good gracious. Let them through. Mister President. - Mister President, maybe... - They're loaded. Let them through. Bologna. Central Station. August 2nd, 1980.10:25 am. A bomb in a suitcase goes off killing 85 people and injuring 200. It's the worst terrorist attack in Italian history after World War II. We resume the conversation, paying our debt to Lucio Dalla. It's alright, I can collect it next year. I wanted to ask, since I'm interested in the song... The song... The discourse on the Euromissiles. Craxi, you're saying that Europe has always been open to the Soviet Union in terms of financial credit as well as in terms of dialogue. So, why is it that the Soviets are preparing such sophisticated offensive or defensive systems? I said it in one of my songs, Russians and Americans are exactly the same. I believe there's something greater at stake that is harder to analyse. Especially when it comes to the people. How can the people in Sicily, or in Emilia-Romagna, or in Lombardy say 'yes' or 'no' to the installation of missiles? "Are those missiles against us or someone else?" We had initially mentioned the opportunity to rebuild relationships within the Italian Left... so as to find a common ground... I'm not a politician. I'm an entertainer who believes... Europe is already scattered with missiles. It won't allow for the political canalization of dissent... an extended lecture from philosopher Luporini... our 'no' to the Euromissiles includes those from the East and from the West. Your heart beats slower, slowly slowly Ciao, how are you I feel your heart now I've never seen your eyes so beautiful But don't turn away now I still want to watch you Don't turn your head Where are your hands Let's wait 'til it's light again 'Til we hear a voice Let's wait without fear For tomorrow It seems to me, Lucio is more loved now that he's dead than when he was alive. Let's be honest. It's quite strange. Such a... fervent admiration for Lucio after years of of being marginalized. But it's also legitimate because... Maybe I'm overreaching, but if Lucio's songs will be read 50 years from now, it's because they still work. And it's true that there's hardly anyone I know, and who met Lucio, who wasn't fascinated by him. People from the music industry, as well as the general public. He had such a strong impact. He never stayed the same, so to speak. He was like a perpetual firework. We miss him, but... Soon after Lucio's death, you know we've never said a word about Lucio, we're doing it now, exceptionally. Morandi said he was expecting Lucio to come back from South America saying, "I was kidding, guys, I'm not dead". Sure enough, among us friends we speak of Lucio in the present tense. We can't... Curiously, his presence goes beyond time, somehow. It's not just that the songs stay, the body leaves. His body is still here, too. His voice. His transformations. He's here. Where are you going? I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm coming. Ultimately, like a hero. - Why are you leaving? - Ordinarily. Because it's written. It's my destiny. There's always a departure or a return. The greatest heroes do that in their daily life. For me, leaving Bologna is painful, sometimes. Like a cut. At times, it's a relief. I like Bologna and I dislike it. Leaving takes on meanings that can be disquieting. It's good to leave and it's even better to come back. I'd love to give a saucy and sentimental sense to each departure and each return. Saucy, I can do. Sentimental, not so much. Lucio! FOR LUCIO
