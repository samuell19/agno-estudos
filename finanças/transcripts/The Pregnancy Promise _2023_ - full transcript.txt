Hello? Hello?! Hello, I need help! Hello?! Who's there? Who's there? Answer me! Hello? Somebody please, help me! What question are you on? Lucy? Lucy? Hold on. You have to see this. Look at the cuteness! I want one! - Which, the baby or the dog? - Both! Get to work. Come on, it's senior year, we have to study. You mean, you have to study. Face it, Skye, only one of us is college bound. And then, we'll never see each other again. You can come visit me whenever you like. And I'll probably end up video chatting you so much you'll wanna block me. Yeah, right. I think my dad's home. - Guess what? - What? The Price Hill housing development, we won the contract. That's amazing! How? I didn't think we stood a chance against all those bigger fish. I don't know, I haven't spoken with them yet, but I guess Mayor Adams went with a local contractor in the end. Wait, wait. Wait right there. Right there! All right, let's see. Oh, for you. And you. And you. Honey! That is beautiful. I could not have landed the contract without my amazing head of office. Sorry, Lucy, I don't have anything for you. Don't be silly, I'm not family. But I will stay for dinner, if offered. Of course! That's so great. Like that phone I got ya? Depends if it's a bribe, or not. It was a gift. But yes, since you've graduated, you know, I'd like for you to join the business. I told you, I wanna travel. Hey, and that's good. But one day, you have to return home. Why work for someone else when you can work for me? Because it'd be my choice. Burgers are up. Stop it! He's my brother! Yeah, but he's not mine. Ugh! Ew! Ew, ew, ew. Whoops, sorry. Here we go. Oh, Skye, did you remember to take your insulin? Mom, do you remember a time I forgot? I'm not a kid anymore. You don't have to worry about me. Oh really? Well, I happen to be your mom and it's my job to worry. All right. Okay. Oh, these are so cute. Look how adorable that one is. Oh, my gosh, that's me at Homecoming. Wait, wait, scroll back. Was that your 10th birthday, or mine? Uh, yours. Remember you wore that party dress for like, a month straight. Yeah. Such great memories. It's sad we won't be able to make any more when you leave. Lucy, I want to go to college. Yeah, to study art. Not architecture. Come on, architects get steady work and artists don't. I love your parents. Compared to my mom, they're amazing. But you have to stop living the life they choose for you. You don't go out if they tell you to stay home and study. You don't wear the clothes that you want. And now, you're not following your dreams. Listen, we have almost a whole year left before you go to college. Let's make it our best ever! I'm talking parties, vacations, boys. - Maybe. Maybe! - No. No, not maybe. You have to make the promise. The promise? - Please? Please? - Really? Really? Okay. I promise. Best friends promise. - Thank you. - Oh my gosh. Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Simmons. Have a good night! Alcohol? I thought we agreed. Oh, please. Let me guess, 'round at the Simmons house again? You spend more time there than you do at your own home. I wonder why. Oh, I'm sorry this isn't a mansion like Skye's, but she enjoys the support and security of two incomes. But we will soon, too, right? What? He's not moving in, is he? Drop the attitude. And I didn't mean Ron, I meant you. Soon you'll finish school, start working, and more money will be coming into the house, hmm? Right. I just don't know what to do with her. I mean, back off, you know? It's all good. She's my mom, yes, and I love her, but does she really think I'm gonna live at home for the rest of my life? No way! And she's on this new medication now, which is actually really helping with her mental health and her anxiety this time. And she has Ron! She doesn't need me. I want my own place. Apartments are kind of expensive. Do you really think you could afford one? I'll figure it out. Hey, look who it is. Last year, Sasha Unwin was the quiet, nerdy girl at the back of class. Now she's Super-Mom! Yeah, I kinda feel bad for her. Why? She got to quit school, the father's parents are paying for everything, and everyone adores her and her baby. She's lucky. Sure, if you count changing stinky diapers as lucky. It is a cute baby. We should be like her. Keep still. Who? Sasha Unwin! You wanna have kids, don't you? Possibly, eventually. How amazing would it be if we had babies together? They would be best friends. And we could hand out at the mall, and at the daycare centers with all the other moms. Okay, slow down. We don't even have boyfriends, or jobs. And I have like, a thousand things I wanna do before I have kids. Would you at least promise that we'll have babies together someday? And as soon as possible. Lucy, enough with the promises. We're not eight years old anymore. Please? Come on, I need this. With you going away to college and me stuck at home with my mom, I need to at least hold on to the dream that we'll be moms together someday. Best friend promise. Now, keep still. You do look really good in this. Let's go, G-O! Go! Go! Purple and gold, let's go, G-O! Go! Go! Purple and Gold, let's go, G-O! Go! Go! Purple and gold, let's go, G-O! Go! Go! Purple and gold, let's go, G-O! Go! Go! Purple and gold, let's... I'm sorry. Are you okay? Skye, you do that in competition, we won't win anything this year. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again. Five minutes everyone, then we'll run it again. I'm sorry. If you can't get it right, then let me be captain. So, it was Jake Dawson who distracted you. I thought he graduated last year? He did. Rumor has it, he didn't get the sports scholarship applied for, so I guess he's helping out the basketball team while he reapplies. You like him, don't you?! No, no, stop it. I don't... I don't even know him. Then we should totally go to Brooke's party this weekend. He'll definitely be there. - We're not invited. - Who cares? We'll crash it. Charles and Diane will let you out, right? Yeah, sure, of course they will. We're going. No, no, no. Absolutely not. The whole squad is going to be there. Lucy is going to be there. Oh, yeah, of course she will be. Honey, why can't you just start making your own decisions? How about right now? I wanna go to this party. You have to do your studies. College is gonna be here before you know it. And in the meantime, what, I just... I have zero social life? You have to make sacrifices if you wanna achieve things in life. Your father and I did. Plus, it's a late night. What about your diabetes? I monitor myself literally 24-7. I am diabetic, I am not made of glass, and... Please, can I go to this party? Can you be a person for once, and not a parent? I've made my decision. Please be mature enough to accept it. Hey. Whew! That was much easier to do when I was 10. - Yeah. - Why aren't you dressed? Didn't you get my message? My parents said I can't go. Yeah, yeah. But you promised to make this year our best ever, remember? I just want you to have a little bit of fun. But if you don't wanna go, I won't make you. Maybe a little bit. Let's find you something cute. What's this? Oh it's just my birth control. Um, I keep it there to help me keep it organized. Miss Skye Simmons, birth control! I may have misjudged you. It's not what you think. It just helps with my cramps. How do I look? I like it. You ready to go? Yeah. After you. I hate to admit it, but Brooke sure does throw a good party. Wanna find some drinks? Uh... I might stay back here a sec. But we came here to have fun together. 30 minutes ago, I was doing algebra. Just let me acclimate. You go have fun. I'll catch up with you later. Fine. That wasn't that great. Six at best. Really? Personally, I think I'd only give it a four. Ooh, tough judge. I'm Jake. Oh, I know. I watched you play starting guard last year. I'm Skye. Nice to meet you, Skye. Mind if I hang out here for a while? Getting kinda tired of dodging the host. Sure. Well, look who it is. I guess that means my sister is here, too? - Yeah. - Don't worry. I'm not gonna rat you guys out. Skye knows that. Oh, just like you didn't rat me out when I scratched your mom's car? That was eight years ago. I'm a nicer guy now. And a much better dresser, too. Nice shirt. I want to go to college, play professionally, but it's a lot of pressure, especially with my dad. Kinda sounds like my parents. They started their business from the ground up and they expect my brother and I to do the same. Well, Simmons Construction is a big deal around these parts. I didn't tell you what my last name was. Busted. I already knew who you were. I used to see you on the courts last year and I wanted to say hi then, but you know, unwritten school code, captain of the ball team shouldn't be seen talking to some quiet girl from the grade below. You're talking to me now. I'm not at school now. Lucy? Skye! It was just a kiss. No, you and Aaron, it's just, ugh! I mean, it's just too weird. I think... I think it would ruin our friendship. Ruin it more than you ditching me to go to college? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that... that wasn't fair. But hey, if you don't want me to kiss Aaron at parties anymore, I won't. - Thank you. Friends? - Always. Okay, good, 'cause I kissed someone, too. - What?! - I know! I kissed Jake Dawson! Oh, my God! Honey. Honey. I heard something. Hi, I'm Skye. I'm here to pick up Jake. Really? When I was growing up, it was usually the guys who came and picked up the girls. Yeah. Progress, right? Hey, Jake! Some girl here for you. That's your car? Yeah, it's definitely way too new and nice for a first car, but my dad insisted. Said it had all the best safety features or something. - Generous dad, huh? - Yeah, yeah. He's a good guy. When he's around. He just won some new construction project on the edge of town, and I'll probably not see him very much for the next year. Wait, wait, Simmons? Your dad's Charles Simmons? Yeah! Do you know him? Yeah, but uh, I doubt high and mighty Simmons knows about me. About time. Next time be ready to greet your visitors. Don't mind him. He disapproves of all my friends. Says I should only focus on basketball and my future. Gotcha. So, where are we going? See a movie? Get something to eat? Oh my gosh! What are you doing? I'm trying to get your attention. I called and texted you like 20 times last night. - I was with Jake. - That I figured. This was supposed to be our best year ever, and I've barely seen you the last couple weeks. You're the one who said we were supposed to go to more parties and meet boys. Yeah, meet boys. Not make boyfriends! And how long do you think this is gonna last anyway? You're supposed to go to college soon! Long distance relationships never work. Okay, I'll figure something out. I mean, Jake and I have been talking about applying to some of the same schools. It's that serious between you guys? Maybe? I don't know, this is all still new to me. Look, I'm really sorry I didn't text you back and I'll make more time for you from now on, I promise. Best friends shouldn't have to make time for each other. - This is amazing. - Yeah. Oh, don't tell Lucy I brought you here, though. We discovered this place a few years ago when we were riding our bikes and we made this promise that we'd never tell anyone. Then why are you telling me? Because I like you. And I trust you. But the reservations were all already made. I don't care about your reservations or your friends. I'm tired! Do you understand that? Tracey, relax... I'm tired of all your whining! Go! Go on your own! I don't care! Looks quite the project. Yeah. I've got a house viewing over in Langsett. I saw you standing here. I thought I'd come over, say hi. And see when the houses here will be built? Oh, I admit, a few potential buyers are holding back until they see your plans and schedules. But hey, all's fair in love and real estate, right? Always. How you doing, Tracey? Well, you know, surviving. How's Lucy doing? I haven't seen her around the house lately. Oh, um, probably thinks three's a crowd. You know, Skye and that graduate she's been dating for weeks. Jack, or Jake, or someone? Skye hasn't told you? So, you really think during your senior year, with everything that is riding on it, you have time for a boyfriend? And why hide him from me? What is wrong with this Jake? Obviously, he's a violent axe murderer, Mom! I could do without the sarcasm, thank you very much. What does an older guy like that want with you? Do you think I'm not pretty enough for him? Honey, you know that is not what I'm saying. Because maybe, if you let me wear makeup, or the clothes I wanted, then guys would actually be interested in asking me. Honey, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just got riled up. - Was it something you ate? - No, no, I'm fine. Have you been sick longer than today? No, I just got riled up! Okay. I'm gonna go to bed. Well... I don't understand. If you've been taking your birth control properly, then what's the problem? I've been dizzy every morning and have no energy. That's, that's not normal. No, it's not. We are so lucky to live in a place like this. This would be a great town to raise a kid in. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. All right, you ready? It's done? Yeah. No, I don't think I can look at it. - You said you were careful. - I was! I'm on the pill. Then how'd this happen? I'm sorry. Does anyone else know? Only Lucy. Keep it that way, at least until you're certain. I need to go. Okay, well, wait, hold on! I mean... - Went that badly, huh? - Uh-huh. You shouldn't have come to school. I had to. My parents already think that something's wrong. I don't know what to do. I... I can't do this on my own. You won't have to. I took a test this morning, and... No! No, no, no, you can't be! I mean, you're not even seeing anyone. Please don't be mad. We only kept it a secret so that you wouldn't get upset. Aaron?! No! No! Ugh! He's my brother! And you, you promised you'd stay away. That was before you started seeing Jake. It has been so rough with my mom the last few weeks and you weren't there. Aaron was. Please don't tell me you did this on purpose! Of course not! But now that I am, now that we both are, by some miracle, I couldn't be happier. No one else is going to be! Everybody's gonna think that we planned this. Then we'll tell them the truth. Aaron, our parents, everyone. Hey, it's gonna be okay. - Did she plan it? - Get out of my room! Did Lucy get pregnant on purpose? You two tell each other everything. She must've told you! She didn't tell me you two were dating behind my back. Was she even really on birth control? Is she planning on keeping the baby? Tell me what you know! Back off, okay! I have got my own problems! Oh, like what? Winning some cheerleading trophy? How could you be so careless? So nalïve? God, I've talked to you about boys, and physical relationships, the dangers. Why did you stop taking the birth control? I didn't! I mean, I've been reading that different meds, or food, or drink can reduce the effectiveness. Maybe. Maybe I would believe that if lightning had struck once. But not twice. Not so close together. Lucy told me she was on the pill. Mom, I swear, I didn't plan this. I... Why would I? To make a point. You both have railed against us for months. I mean, years. Said we're too demanding, too controlling compared to your friends' parents. Maybe this is payback. You wanting to prove you're adults, able to make your own life decisions. The last thing I want is some kid. I wanna travel, be free. I had my whole life in front of me. I mean, I wanted to go to college, and now I don't... I don't know what to do. Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay. We'll get through this together. This might feel cold. Everything looks normal. Now for the special part. It's time for you to take a look. No. I just... I mean, um... I think I'm okay not looking for now. Do you wanna tell me what that was about? The less I see or know about the baby, the better. I... I wanna have it... But I'm not so sure if I wanna raise it. Oh. Does Jake feel the same? I haven't told him yet. But I mean, you and Dad will be happy, right? I mean, there'll be a delay, but I'll still be able to go to college. If that's still what you want now. Becoming a parent, it's... It's tough. It's a huge challenge and responsibility. But the best days of my life are when you and Aaron were born. And watching you grow up. Just promise me you're not gonna rush into any final decision, okay? Okay, okay. Hey! Hi. I couldn't resist. Here! I got one for both of us. Well, both of them, I mean. I'd kinda like to keep my news quiet for a while. Oh, okay. I understand. Thanks. I won't tell anyone my news, either. But it's still cute though, right? Yeah, it's cute. Hey, how's it going? Charles Simmons. Suppose you better come in. Wipe your feet. Wipe your feet. I guess I'll start. Um... Once the baby's born, I'm considering putting it up for adoption. Wait, what? We didn't discuss that. I didn't think you'd care. You didn't even come to the sonogram appointment. I was shocked, upset, when you told me, but now, I've had time to think. It's my baby, too. I feel responsible toward it, like I should. No, no, no, quiet, okay. Now listen, she's right. Adoption is the best way out of this mess. Meanwhile, you need to focus on your basketball. If I get into college, get a pro contract, I'd make more than enough to support a kid. And until then, what, huh? What? Let us pay for everything? Raise it for you? We'd pay our share. Give our support, too. - We would. - That's funny. I don't think I asked for your charity. Carl! You'll have to forgive my husband. Money's a sore topic. Kathy, please. We're really sorry to hear that. What do you do? He's an architect. A good one. Yeah, that's where I recognize you from! You designed the Far Water Mall years back, right? And you had a bid in for the Price Hill development? Like you don't know. You know, thought we were a shoe-in until Mayor Adams chose your company at the last second. That was a thorough and fair process. Yeah, sure, sure it was. Yeah. You know, rumor is, you and the mayor, you're hand in glove. Even go play golf together. If you've got something to say, why don't you say it? Okay. Why don't we focus on why we're here? Yeah? Skye's due date is somewhere early to mid-May, so we have a lot to talk about. At least this'll be friendlier than the summit with Jake Dawson's parents. Let's start. I have two house viewings on the opposite side of town. We can't begin without Skye. This affects her, too. I've been putting a lot of thought into this whole situation. And the fact is... There isn't enough room at Mom's house. So, what if maybe, possibly, me and the baby could come live here instead? Well, why not? The baby could have its own nursery and Skye and I can help each other, all under one roof. - I'd be okay with that. - Well, I wouldn't be. This isn't about what's best for the baby you're carrying, is it? It's about what's best for you. What? Yeah, you've always wanted to be a part of this family, and this is your big chance. You figured all this out. Haven't you? All of you. No, hold on! This is the first we've heard about it, Tracey. Lucy already has a home, okay? Granted, it's not as big and fancy as this place, but still, she has a home. No one is disputing that, Tracey. Just because I haven't had the same success you've had? I don't enjoy the same luxuries you do. It doesn't make me any less of a parent. We know that, and if we've offended you in any way, I apologize. So, what's the endgame here, huh? You're gonna freeze me out? Embarrassing, sick grandparent and I only get to see the baby on holidays, birthdays? If I behave? If I've taken my medication? - Nobody is saying that. - I've heard enough. Come on. We're leaving. So, have your parents said anything more about me moving in with you guys? I mean, not to me, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. It's kind of a big ask. You say it like I'd be a burden. Could you at least try and persuade them? Skye? You okay? Skye? Skye! What's wrong? Are you okay? Just breathe. Breathe. Guess I was so nervous about the baby. Still so tiny and vulnerable. It would be better if everyone knew. Better yet, if we quit. I told you, I want to stay. You mean, your parents want you to stay? No, if I stay, then I can finish classes and maybe even some exams early, if I'm lucky. Why bother? You're gonna be too busy with the baby to go to college. I'd just like to keep my options open. Jake, what're you doing back here? Checking if Skye wasn't home. Why? Came to talk to you and Mr. Simmons. I've already graduated, I can start college this term, catch up, then be in a better position to support Skye and the baby. I thought you didn't have enough money for college? I don't, which is where you come in. You could loan me the money, then I pay you back when I graduate and get a contract. If you get a contract. I'm sorry, Jake, I don't think that this is gonna work. - Why not? - Because it isn't feasible. And what I've seen of your father, he'd never approve. Plus, it might put undue stress and pressure on Skye. She wouldn't have to know, or my parents. I'm sorry. The answer's still no. You know, I thought at least you'd consider my idea. After all, you kind of owe me. Excuse us? If my dad had got work on that new project, the one the mayor helped you get, he'd have paid for my college. Don't believe everything your father tells you. Now, I think it's time you left. I'm only trying to do the right thing. It's exactly what I didn't want to happen. Why did Jake have to tell everyone? It wasn't Jake. It was me. What? They're gonna notice when we start getting bigger anyway. That's if we decide to stay. I have told you so many times, I wanna stay in classes! Even with everyone staring at you? Playing pranks? And whose... And whose fault is that? You had no right to broadcast my news to everyone like that. All right, girls, let's go! Get on the field! Ladies, can you hold back for me, please? I'm sorry, Coach, we'll be ready in just a minute. That won't be necessary. I'm sorry, girls, but the team has expressed concern about working with you. They're afraid the somersaults and the lifts are gonna endanger you in your current condition. And I have reservations about you being on the pyramid. But I'm the captain! Your safety is also my priority. Now, Brooke has volunteered to step up in your absence. If you still want to be part of the team, I need help with admin, maintaining uniforms. I'm sorry, ladies. See? They don't want us here. The sooner you realize that, the better. Hey. Hey. Me too. Come on. Let's go find somewhere better to eat. What are you doing here? My dad sent me out for groceries. Should've gone and coached the school team after, but they called, said I'm no longer welcome in school. Um, I'm not the one who told everyone. I don't care, as long as it made you reach the right decision. Why don't you come inside, and we can talk about this some more? I don't think that's a good idea. Just watch your back at school. And by the second trimester, you should begin to see some more significant changes to your body. Back aches, larger breasts, and your stomach beginning to expand as the fetus begins to grow more. But don't worry, there is plenty of room in there. The uterus can expand up to 20 times its normal size. Hey, Mom. I see you're drinking again. Would you just? I'm taking five minutes to myself before I get back to work. Because of that. We need all the commission I can get now. Mom, you're really tired. Can you please just take the rest of the day off? I wish I could. Wow, getting bigger. Mm-hmm. Ooh. You hurting? No, no, I'm just... Kinda feels weird. Well, I'll let you get some rest. I just came to give you these. It explains the adoption process and your role in it. - My role? - Yeah. You get a say in who the baby's parents will be. Make sure it gets into a warm and loving home. I'm not sure I can do that. I don't know the first thing about being a good parent. I know it's a lot to think about. I'll just leave these here in case you change your mind. Can I feel? Yeah. It's that. That's just the baby moving. Oh. Oh, it feels so weird. That was my favorite part about being pregnant. Oh, sorry. It might... It might be work. I know. What is it? Simmons Construction are crooks. You bribed the mayor. You're gonna lose everything. Wow, someone has an active imagination. And a really big problem with us. Skye's been getting anonymous abuse, too. It's just trolls. Lonely losers with nothing better to do. They'll get bored soon. And if they don't? Sticks and stones. Oh, my God. What a mess. Mayor Adams. Should've seen it a couple hours ago. Any idea who's behind it? Well, if I had, I'd have already called the cops. Pity. I'd hoped you could provide a name. Help the both of us. Owen, what's going on? I shouldn't even be talking to you right now, but I wanted to give you a heads up. The city council has received a complaint about your winning the Price Hill development and my awarding of it. A complaint? Who? It was made anonymously, but relates to allegations of collusion, bribery. Just like in the messages. That's ridiculous. We are innocent. I know that, you know that, but there's a process that has to be followed in these sorts of situations. Until the investigations conclude, I'm afraid the development has been put on hold. We've already signed contracts! We've bought new equipment and supplies. We will lose a fortune every day this project is delayed! I understand, but I'm sorry. Well, we can cover overhead and wages maybe into next month, but... If an inquiry drags on... Say it. We might not just lose the business, we might lose the house. Clock's ticking. R.I.P. Simmons Construction. Who is doing this to us? I don't know. But I do know the abuse started after Skye become pregnant and after we refused to pay someone's college fund. You're pretty good. Mrs. Simmons. How's Skye? She's okay, under the circumstances. She's been getting abuse at school, and last night, our home was attacked. Really? You know who it was? I have some ideas. You and Skye, you met at some party, right? Brooke Edwards. And you saw her and what, it was love at first sight? I liked her straight away, if that's what you mean? I just find it odd that your father doesn't get the contract that Skye's father does, and next thing you know, you and Skye hook up. Okay, the truth is my dad was badmouthing you and Mr. Simmons. I remembered Skye from school, so at the party, I went over to talk to her, to see if she and your family were as self-entitled as my dad said you were. And? I told you, I liked her straight away. I know that you see Skye as a young woman, but I still see her as my little girl. I will do anything to protect her. Make sure you get my bump just right. - Okay. - Ugh, gross! Wow! Abuse to our faces. I guess that's an improvement from troll messaging. I don't know what you're talking about. You must really think we're dumb. The whole school thinks you're dumb. They just have to take one look at your pregnant bellies. - Apologize for that! - Let go of me! - Lucy, don't! - Why do you think you can just talk to us that way? Stop it! You're just making things worse. Apologize, now! Skye! Come in. I thought you were banned from school? Some of the guys on the team called. Told me what happened. I had to check that you were okay. Oh, I just got really light-headed. I bought you these. Vitamins, supplements. The lady at the store said they help the baby grow and develop properly. Oh. I'm already taking these. But um... thanks. Thank you. What were Lucy and Brooke fighting about, anyway? Oh, all the online abuse. Being pregnant can really bring out the internet trolls. I know I could just change my number, delete my accounts, but I'm gonna miss being in contact with people. Any idea who's sending all this? I'm pretty sure it's Brooke, but I can't prove it. Great, yeah, okay, I'm glad you saw that one. No, you don't understand. This is how we catch her. All phone photos contain metadata: time, location they were taken. Forward it to me. I might be able to confirm Brooke's your troll. Really? Thank you. I better go before I get spotted. Oh, Jake. Putting the baby up for adoption... you know I'm doing the right thing, right? Hello? You're going to lose everything. Who are you? What do you want? You'll find out when the time's right. And meanwhile, what? You'll keep hiding like a coward? You're pathetic. You know nothing about me. But I know all about you, your family. Uh, that's, that's really concerning because Charles and I, we've done some things - that we're not proud of. - Go on. You don't know? I was just trying to see what exactly it is you have on us. Again, you'll get to know in time. Oh, and Diane? Nice try, but you walked past me 10 seconds ago. Being captain of the team's not enough for you? Excuse me? I can handle the online abuse, but, I mean, ruining my artwork? That was something I worked really hard on, and it was important to me. I don't know what you're talking about. Brooke, you know what? You can bully or taunt me all you want, but I'm not going to give up. If you really wanna ruin my art? You know what, fine, I'll just draw another. And if you wanna ruin that, I'll draw another and another. One thing I won't do is give into you. If you weren't pregnant, there's no way I would let you make those accusations or speak to me like that. Ugh! What was that? Standing up for myself. Felt kinda good. Yes! And you couldn't recognize the voice? They were altering it, using some sort of distortion filter. So, you couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman, or how old they were? No. Just be on your guard. Look out for anyone suspicious. That's it? That's all you're gonna say? What else can I say? I don't know if you've noticed, but we are practically broke. I'm sorry. It's okay. Everything's gonna go back to normal after the inquiry, once we're cleared. Yeah, if we survive until then. Sent to the company e-mail, "Charles Simmons is as crooked as his badly built houses." Where's your boy? Excuse me? The messaging, attacking my house, stalking my family. It's Jake. Are you crazy? Get off my property. - No, I'm not. - Dad? No, Jake, go back inside, man. Hey, if he's got nothin' to hide, then let him step out here and let's just talk. Let me explain something to you. My son has nothing to do with that smear campaign, you understand me? And neither do I! I'm gonna tell you something, if I met the person who did, I'd shake their hand. Shake his hand. Stop it! We have nothing to hide. We can show you our phone records, computers, anything you like. That's not necessary. I am so sorry about all of this. With everything that's happening, I guess it's just... It's taken its toll on him. Just keep him away from our family, okay? The next time, I promise you, he'll regret it. What are you doing here? You can't be here. Your troll's number and when and where they posted abuse to you. My dad thinks you're the one trashing our family. I know. I've been trying to find the source of your parents' anonymous abuse, but it's proven tricky. Your troll, on the other hand. This can't be right. You recognize the number? Whose is it? Hey! I thought I'd check on you. You haven't been to school in days. Yeah, I'm just really tired. Wanna come inside? Yeah. I heard about your dad. If you need any advice on quick to anger, temperamental parents... What about temperamental friends? Lucy, I know it's been you. You're the one sending all the anonymous abuse. What? You must be joking. Jake's great with tech stuff. He helped set up the school's entire IT Department before he was banned. We found it was all coming from your number and this location. Then he made a mistake! Really? Okay, let's test it. How could you? I just thought your parents were putting pressure on you to stay in school, so I wanted to help you quit! I told you so many times that I didn't wanna quit! And you never listened! And my locker, and my art. The painting I was making was you. - Skye... - You ruined it! You've been the one abusing my parents, too? No, that wasn't me, I swear. I only ever sent you the messages. But I stopped after I saw how you stood up to Brooke. I realized how wrong it was. And that makes everything better? No, of course, it doesn't. But you have to realize, I was just doing what I thought was right. Skye, this, none of this, has to affect us. We can still be friends! We can still be moms together! That's never going to happen. I'm never going to be a mom. I don't understand. Why are you saying that? I'm putting my baby up for adoption. No, you're not. You're only saying that to get back at me. I made the decision months ago. Why didn't you tell me? Because I knew how you were going to react! You had all these crazy ideas about us being moms and living together. And we still can! And if I can convince my mom to let me come live with you guys then it'll be amazing! Lucy! I have made my decision. And it's what's best for me, and for Jake, and for the baby. What about me? Don't I count? After everything I've done for you? - I have to go. - You can't just leave! After all my planning, after everything! What do you mean, planning? I just meant all my support is all. With the baby and the classes. When my mom found out about us, she accused of planning. That we'd gotten pregnant together on purpose, but I mean, I told her she was crazy! You know what? I'm really tired. I think you should just go. And that stupid promise you made us make! I mean you didn't... You didn't do anything that made me get pregnant... Right? I think that's all on Jake. You didn't mess with my birth control, did you? Skye, please! I'm your best friend! We've known each other our entire lives! Right. Yeah, so I'll be able to tell if you're lying to me, or not. Lucy. Lucy! Are you the reason I'm pregnant? I just didn't want to be alone. You were going off to college and spending so much time with Jake! I just wanted us to stay together! My mom never throws away her old medications or pills. Not even her birth control. So I went over to visit Aaron, snuck away to your room... I knew the expired pills wouldn't protect you against pregnancy. I wish I could say it was for you. But the truth is... it was just all about me. Yep. Yeah, it was. The baby's developing just fine, however it is positioned a little too low for my liking. Well, is it okay? Is there something I should do? Relax. Now, and for the remainder of your pregnancy, it's important that you keep a close eye on your insulin levels so that we can avoid the risk of preterm labor. Okay. My doctor's adjusted them. That's good. And don't worry, you're doing great. You and your support. Hey, I'm telling you, it's a boy. Definitely a boy. Please, you said the same thing about Skye. And Aaron. 50% success rate, thank you very much. Okay, Nostradamus. Why don't you go down and see what we can get for dinner? Here, let me help ya. No, Mom, you're fussing. I'm fine, I'm fine. I will fuss if I wanna fuss. The hospital said that you need to be rested, and you can't rest if you're not comfortable. Thank you. Is there anything else I can get you? No. So, thanks for coming by. I will be in touch! - Okay, thank you. - Great! Bye! Hey. Hey, Mom! Are you gonna be near a store on your way home? The baby's craving chocolate milk today. I'm in between viewings. Already late for my next. What about after? I'll pick something up on the way home, but that's not gonna be until... Mom? Uh, I've gotta go. Uh... bye. Hey lady, you hit me! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I'm fine, but you hit me! I don't know how this happened. - You were on your phone. - No, I wasn't! - Yes, you were, I saw you! - No, I wasn't on my phone. Let's let the cops figure it out. No, absolutely not! No, no! I can call insurance! You don't need to call the cops! - Gimme my phone back! - No! This is a tap. There's nothing wrong with your car. Mom! Where have you been? I've been worried sick about you! Um... the police kept me for hours. The police? I was in my car, and I reversed back, and I tapped another guy. Got into a fight so he called the cops. Did a blood alcohol test and they charged me with a DUI. My license is gonna be revoked, I'm gonna lose my job. I might be facing jail. Mom! For all the times I've told you to stop drinking in the middle of the day! Don't talk to me like you're perfect, like you're innocent. This is your fault! My whole life is your fault, ever since you were born! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to say that. Stay away from me! My baby and I will be better off without you. There they are. The ones who'll decide if we have a home and a business by the end of the day. You've done nothing wrong. We've got nothing to hide. I know. So, why do I feel so damn nervous? It's Skye. I've gotta go. Okay. Okay. Ugh, I feel like a planet! I feel like a big, huge planet Jupiter. I remember that feeling. Oh, I'm so sorry I texted you during the hearing. I didn't mean to distract. No, hey, nothing is more important to us than you and Aaron. - Thanks. - And... Whether we lose the business or not, no matter what happens, we're gonna make more time for you and Aaron. You want me to keep the baby, don't you? I want you to be happy. Which is why, if you do go to college, I think you should study art. Really? What made you change your mind? You did. Anyone home? We're in Skye's room. He's back already? Whatever happens, we'll... We'll get through it together. We've been cleared. They found no evidence of bribery, collusion, anything! We're good! We are back on! Oh, baby! Wait, wait! Come here, include me! Don't forget about Jupiter! Jupiter, is that what we're calling it now? - Mm-hmm. - Is it Jupiter? I love Jupiter. All right, broccoli. Hey, leave some for the rest of us! It's not for me, it's for the baby. Now that the inquiry's over and the development's back on track, there'll be more work than ever. But if you'd sooner work for someone else... No, no, no. You pay me pretty well. Besides, I kinda like working for my old man. All right, I like the sound of that. Sorry for the mess? You guys okay? Stay here with Skye. - Are you cut? Are you hurt? - I'm fine. No, I'm fine. Don't bother searching for me. I'm already gone. This is insane. We've been proven innocent, it's over. I'll decide when it's over, not you. Who are you? What do you want? Compensation. What I'm owed. Which is? You'll know soon enough. Who was it? Did you make it? I just got to school. Okay. Well, be careful. Yes, yes, I'll be careful, I promise. Alright, let me know if you need anything. I love you. All right, love you, too. Bye. Come on. Give me any sort of kick? I'll eat a chip if you do. Ah! Oh. Okay, good job. You've earned this one. Lucy! Lucy? Maybe we're just early. It's really so beautiful out here. I'm really sorry you can't see it. I'm sorry I won't be able to be there to show it to you. I really do want what's best for you. You understand that, right? Hi. Hey, was that a yes or a no? Lucy? Lucy, it's all right. I'm not mad at you. Lucy? Ow! What? What did you... What did you do? Hi, it's Skye! Sorry I can't get to the phone right now, but leave a message and I'll get back to you. Skye, it's Mom again. I don't know why you're not calling me back and why you're so late getting home, but please, please, call me as soon as you get this. Something's wrong. She's in trouble. I know it. Let's just stay calm. She's just out a little late, that's all. Oh, no, no, with all these threats and if she knew she was gonna be out late she would've taken her extra meds. I'll check with Lucy, whether she wants to talk to me, or not. Okay, and I'll check with her friends, um, the girls from the squad. And Jake. Wait, and his crazy dad? Then I'm coming with you. No, I need you to stay here. If she comes home and she needs help quick, you'll be here. Okay. Uh, extra meds are in the cabinet. Hello? Hello? Who's there? Answer me! Who's there? Lucy? Charles, what are you doing here? Well, it's Lucy I wanna talk to. Skye didn't come home from school today and she's not answering her phone, and in her current condition, I'm a little concerned. I've spoken with Lucy. She's assured me she'll never contact Skye again. And that's good to know. Still, I would like to talk to Lucy myself. Of course. Right away. Why don't you come in and wait? Thank you. Jake, hey. Have you seen Skye today? Spoken to her at all? No. Is Skye okay? - Charles, did you find her? - I'm at Lucy's house. She's not here. Only Tracey, who promised to call her. And? I don't know, she asked for privacy, she went into the bedroom, and she just hasn't come out since. She just... I don't know, she's on edge. She seems all out of sorts and that's not all. I think she's planning on leaving town. Leaving, to go where? I don't know, it just seems... What did you.. What? Charles? Charles? Charles can't talk now, Diane. It's his fault for turning up before I was ready. Had to finish packing. Tracey, what have you done? Nothing that can't be fixed. As long as you do what I say. I am gonna forward you details to a bank account. Wire $500,000 to it in the next hour and I'll tell you where I'm keeping Skye. Tracey, have you lost your mind? On the contrary. I am thinking more clearly than I ever have. How dare you! Where is Skye? As soon as you transfer the money, I will tell you where Lucy and Skye are. Any delay, any hint of police involvement, the deal's off. No, wait, wait, Tracey! Just wait, just listen, please. Please listen. Skye, she's diabetic, okay? If she doesn't have access to her medication, she... She could die, okay? Just please. Then you'll hurry. Won't you? It's no use. I don't think anyone can hear us down here. But at least we can talk. It's my mom. She's sick! And she's in trouble. She thinks that she can get out of it if she blackmails your family. I'm so sorry. I never meant for you to get hurt. I was just so desperate to keep you in my life. I've ruined yours. I don't know if I can forgive you. But I think I get why you did it. I know how lonely you must have been feeling. Thank you. Are you okay? My blood sugar's already really low and... I need my meds or... I don't know if I can make it. Hey, hey, hey! He's out. But his vitals are solid. He's gonna be okay. Is there anyone else in the house? - No! - Are you sure? Did you check the attic and the basement? We checked. He was the only one inside. If you'd like to accompany him to the hospital. Yeah, I'm just gonna get my purse. Okay. - Let's get him up. - You're leaving? I've gotta wire that money to Tracey. You can't trust her to keep her word. You have to tell the police. No, we cannot take that risk. Our only hope of finding Skye before it's too late is to give Tracey exactly what she wants. No! There's another way. Most phones contain time and location data. Tracey's been smart enough to turn off the tracking function on her phone and Skye's and Lucy's, but she did that after taking them to where they're being held. And if I can triangulate that location using cell towers, data records... We might be able to find them. It's her. I haven't received the money yet. Tracey, please be reasonable. It's hard to arrange to send that amount of money at short notice. Do you think I'm stupid? I worked in real estate. Those amounts go through instantly every day. I'm close! Keep her talking! And, uh, the encrypted messages, the unknown numbers, did you learn those tricks on the job? Kind of. It's amazing how anonymous, eleventh-hour bids can motivate a potential buyer to sign contracts, pay a little extra. That's smart. Really clever. But what is the plan now, Tracey? You gonna what, flee to Mexico? What about seeing Lucy again? What about your grandchild? - You're stalling. - No. Just like you did that time in the street. No, listen to me. We can, we can talk this out. We can figure something out. Okay, please let's just... You have 30 minutes, or else you'll never see your daughter again. No... no, please don't hang up! Jake, talk to me! Hold on. Got it! Skye's phone was last switched on at 6:05 PM somewhere in North Longdale. Suburbs. God, they could be in any number of a thousand houses. Wait, Tracey's a realtor. She would have keys, access to dozens of houses. Do a search for properties in that area. Any houses that are currently for sale. On it! Skye! Please! Please! I can't lose you, Skye! Tell me what you need, please! I'll do anything! The baby. Lucy, please, if it comes to it, please, tell them to save the baby. Skye, please, it's not gonna come to that! Just please promise me they'll save the baby. Promise. I'm gonna save us! Promise me. Promise me. I promise. Best friends promise. This has to be the place. - Skye? You here? - Skye? Lucy? - Diane! - That's Lucy! Lucy? Diane! We're down here! Hurry! Hurry! Hey, are you okay? It's Skye! She needs help! She isn't moving! Oh, God. Stay with me. Okay, stay with me, Skye. Just stay with me, okay? Stay with me, baby. Did it work? Are they gonna be okay? We need to get her to the hospital, now! My baby, hey, wake up, wake up. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. - You got her? - Watch her head. Come on. It's Tracey. She must have been close by the house watching. - We can take her. - No! She has a gun! Okay, we hide. When she goes down to the basement, we make a run for the car. I know you're in here, Diane. Now you're gonna have to wire the money with a gun to your head. You wanna save yourself? Save Skye? You have five seconds to show yourself. One... Two... Did she go downstairs? - Do you think she heard that? - Three... I don't know. Four... Five! Wait. Wait, Tracey. Please, wait. Why? What else do I have to lose? Me. And your grandchild. Move out of the way. If you stop now, if you don't hurt anyone else, then there's still a chance. A chance we can be a family. You've always preferred Skye's family. I'm an embarrassment to you. You don't care about me. You don't need me. So, I don't need you. Then you'll have no problem pulling the trigger. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. - Hi. - Hi. How you feeling? Pretty shaky. The doctor said it was a close call, but you're gonna be fine. No, it's okay. Mom, Mom, I can't... I can't feel the baby. Hey, it's okay. Listen, you had to have an emergency Cesarian, but everything's fine. Can I see it? Hi! Hi. Hi, beautiful. I'm Skye. And I'm your mom. We've done residential. Building sports complexes, that's the next step for Simmons Construction. No, no, no, no. We keep building homes. We stay with what we're great at. What do I think? I think I'll fire you both unless you help me with lunch. Do you think Grandma's being a little fussy? Ha! Do you think she worries too much? No. Honestly, I think that was a yes. It was definitely not a yes. Say, "I can't speak yet, Mom." Yeah, but she's smart. And we're gonna have so much fun in college together, aren't we? - We're back! - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - How's your mom? - She's doing well. I think she's really getting the help she needs. She was so excited to meet baby Emma for the first time. Look who it is. Look who it is. Look who it is, I told you they'd be back soon. Aw, look how cute they are. Do you think they'll be friends for life? Yeah, I do. Just like their moms. Yeah. Here, do you want to suck on your thumb?
