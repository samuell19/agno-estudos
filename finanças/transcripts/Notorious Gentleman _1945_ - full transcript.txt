Father says if they return with a decent majority It will be a tonic for business And of course the sitting room will be delighted But I'm boring you talking politics?

The ass, he'll get sent down for certain this time It shouldn't even be a doubt, I thought you'd like to know But surely they can't send him down for that,it's practical a local sport He's had two final warnings already I suppose I'll get along and see the idiot See you tomorrow,Jill Hello Sandy Give yourself a drink Well,you've done it this time What? Oh that You were absolutely certain to be caught why the blazes did you have to do it? Bet with old Fogroy That's no reason,he won't even pay up Sorry I'm told the climb hadn't been done in daylight before I thought I got quite a kick out of that I don't understand you at all I never feel the slightest urge to climb up every building I see Dear old Sandy,both feet planted firmly on the ground It seems to me the natural place for feet In that case then you should you lend me a quid I really don't see the connection Better make it two then That makes 4 Â£ 17sh and 6p this week Right I say Vivian you're not going out?

No,of course not,what makes you think that? Nothing,I just wondered,see you later The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold,Purple the sails, and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them. The oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes I do wish you didn't have to go away Who told you I have to? Oh,Gherlaine,you know she was telling me all about it in the tea shop this evening Oh,I see We are just ships that pass in the night,aren't we,Vivian? Parking in the backwater I don't believe you care at all I'm broken hearted I shall miss you anyway Oh you still got Oxford What do you mean? You know Oh,hello Sandy Is there anything? I waited up because I wanted a word with you -What about? -Don't pretend you don't know Surely you realize that you are certain to be sent down tomorrow Oh that -Who says so -It's obvious -Is it? -Of course Have a drink Have you any plans? No I was wondering if my father could find you anything What's he in?Soap isn't it? Amongst other things Sound commodity and steady demand And washing is always a universal habit Say when? Are you interested? Not in (?) Of course if it amuses you Yes,Sandy,I haven't slightest intention of getting sent down Talked myself out of it before I shall talk myself out of it again Not this time I shall apologize with cheerful humility Same time reminding me of distinguished figures lost to Oxford too hasty action in the past Shelley,Byron for instance Shelley never climbed a building in his life and Byron went to Cambridge Did he? You are worrying unnecessary,Sandy,take it from me I shall have a personal triumph After tomorrow they'll be begging me to stay I'll get someone to give you the hand with the trunk Hyde Hyde Your suitcase Sir (?) -All right,thanks -Thank you,Sir Dad Good Evening -Is nobody at home? -No,Mr Kenway Everyone is down at the County with your father for the declaration of the polls We haven't met before,have we?

Yes,yes safest Tory seat since Queen Anne died You paid my bill Time somebody did But you docked my allowance to do it With your father's approval We never thought it was single handed I expect that's why he needed a secretary Is he coming back tonight? Oh yes He didn't say he was expecting you No,he wouldn't be I suppose you've been sent down How did you hear? I didn't but it was obviously only a question of time Well,me and the Dean,we didn't see eye to eye on the fundamental issue You mean he didn't consider you an asset to Oxford Yes most unfortunate Quite after all you've only neglected your service accumulated debts,climbed all the principal buildings and been progged in all the usual pubs Your career has been almost tediously conventional I can see that we are going to be great friends It must be Dad You'll break the news gently,won't you? What do you take me for,Miss Calthorp Very satisfactory day,very satisfactory indeed,I hope George got it (?) It would be a national disaster if it is I know that voice You know that you are not remotely interested in politics,Hubert You are only interested in guzzling Robert's whisky Equally interested in both my dear if I may say so Why not? I'll bring you something Hubert -Good Gracious -Vivian! Hello Dad This is a pleasant surprise, my boy,how are you What are you doing in town,eh?

Nothing worse if that's what you mean I see A bit of a shock to me,Vivian I'd look forward to you doing well there I'm sorry,Sir -You miss your blue next season -I know I was looking forward to that match Very well What are you going to do? Get a job,I suppose Not exactly good beginning is it,being sent down No naturally it's that Mind you there was my Uncle George,he was sent down That's why he went to South Africa,wasn't it? Yes,came back with a fortune Didn't seem to do him any harm Greta character,Uncle George,I often thought he must have been very like you Hear them scare them but the right stuff in him BTW there is one thing,Vivian Aunt Angela? -Yes,she won't like it -She'll blow up sky high Do we have to tell her? She's bound to find out sooner or later I assume it would be later "And altogether this overwhelming victory must be regarded as a personal triumph for Mr Ramsay McDonald and Mr Baldwin" -If she asks you don't admit anything -No I mean don't say a word Moreover why did she grace came here We'd never get to bed And in the morning you step down to the farm -Just the two of us -Yes Then we have the future fixed before the old bird finds out Before the old bird can find out what,may I ask? What have you got down so far,Hubert? The Church,the Army,the Navy the Law, medicine,politics then the commerce The churches are half empty, the services been axed barrister are ten a penny, he'll never make a doctor and one politician in the family is more than enough Can't we go into it all again sometime tomorrow? I've had a tiring day Hear,hear Unfortunately the only career for which Vivian seems qualified is steeplejacks May sound a bit extravagant what about gold mining? When we only just come off the gold standard? I think that's the point now where obviously the price of gold going up like mad -Why? -Why? Ha Ha I have no idea I am a miner fortyniner -Shall I put down gold mining? -No-No-No-No I knocked a miner a fortyniner Uncle George managed to do pretty well in Africa Africa in those days was littered with diamonds any fool could pick them up,even Uncle George Well,South America still prospects there never forgot my stay with Jack Brockley when I was Vivian's age -Brockley? -Coffee Managing greater of a company in Porto Bana Fine plantation,lovely climate,wonderful club Polo,cricket,swimming, carpentering Yes we are looking for a job,not a rescuer, besides we want to keep an eye on him Well then he could start at home on the farm learn to man the estate,what's left of it Farming is gone to pot Well,another newcomer will seem bound to set it up Whereupon an anguish howl will go out from Birmingham and it will be knocked flat again -You could speak to Old Mc Kettney,Hubert -Which McKettney Stuart McKettney -Whiskey chap? -Yes That's was an idea,whisky, I'll put that down Hello,can I speak to Sir John Brockley? -Brockley? -Vivian Then put it through his room Colonel Kenway wants to speak to him urgently Sir John? Just hang on,Sir,hang on dad He sound a bit tetchy I think I must have woke him up Anytime tomorrow will suit me,dad Hello,is that Jack? Bob Kenway here,how are you?

Might be worse,Sir Thank you I haven't taken leave for dickens of the time Beastly thing this depression -Twelve months forever is one thing -Let's hope not,Sir-Thank you I put you up for the club,of course -You play bridge -A little,Sir-Good We know all about your cricket,of course Sir John was most enthusiastic about it in his letter -I think you'll like it here,Kenway -I'm sure I will,Sir Don't be afraid of making any suggestions, we'll always be willing to listen Thank you You see we've no one in your class in either bat or ball Yes,Sir Come in Edwards This is Mr Kenway he's come out from home to join us -How do you do -Please to meet you Edwards is on our administration staff Mr Kenway will start with you take him out right away with you and show him around the place Very good,Sir Good Bye Kenway come and see me when you settled down -Thanks,Sir I will -Ready? Excuse me Dozed am I? -Good Afternoon -Hello Edwards -How do you do,Sir? -Hi young man,how are all they all at home? Oh fair enough I was at college of science Constipated as ever Well,haven't had a cigarette on you I seemed to have left mine on the breakfast table -Yes,rather -Just showing him around Before he starts work I'll take two or three Well,Kendall this hovel is the hub of the whole plantation in my opinion but absolutely no one else's -You see Kendall -Kenway,Sir Right so Amongst other things our job is to make four coffee beans grow where only three grew before -Do you care to have a look? -Thanks so much From the nearest touch you adjust the focus -My matches? -I gave them back to you You have a pathetical small mind,Edwards -All right -Yes No need to tell you what that is -Oh -Kenway is a beginner -Oh I see,well,it's an insect of course -I gathered that New arrivals thrives on coffee leaves the same amount as last year and ate its way through nearly a fifth of the entire crop Well,that little chap Yeah,despite of my somewhat limited resources we are focusing within a variety of ways which I must summarise as well as on the one hand the invitation of the parasite on the other Sorry old man I got to show Kenway round the plantation -Must you? -Burgess's orders Typical,absolutely typical but look in again Kennedy and I'll explain my work to you Very kindly thank you very much Thanks for getting me out in time,what a funny old coot From (??) he's the best brain out here Nothing like the best paid,of course so naturally you wouldn't have much time for him Maybe an underpaid old coot, maybe an overpaid old coot -I said whilst he was old coot -Mean he doesn't wear the right tie -I don't have a fig for his tie -He doesn't think with the right people so of course he is a social outcast Must I suppose his liver is not quite the same after a few years in this climate I beg you pardon -I've nothing against you personally,Kenway -Decent of you to say so Just that you're the last straw that's all I'm sick and tired of teaching their jobs to gilded youths backed by influence and class privilege and then watching the men dock with better positions than my own It's always the cheering prospect that this gilded youth turn out to be a complete flop Keep your eye on the ball,never revoke at bridge,believe me you won't flop here I know it's a daring thought from anyone with my background but I might actually work Coffee a drink made from seeds which shrubs in the ground Used in Abyssinia for centuries But have a bit in Koran as intoxicating beverage There is a lot great use of learn and it's far more interesting than I thought especially your end of it I wished the company could say that Hang it all,that's what we grow that counts I could double our yield and save them thousands if they build my an updated experimental station I suppose they say they can't afford it They save it them three times over in 10 years Seems to let my cigarettes in my own suit Have you ever given them the figures? I am not an accountant my boy How much would it cost? Goodness know What if you give us some rough details I suppose so.Why? Well,I was thinking,couldn't we make out a case and propel things for Burgess? -Burgess -He's bound to see it -It's very kind of you my.. -Kind? Nothing it's purely self advancement You know I always find the whisky and soda concentrate the mind wonderfully So do I Let's slip out and have a quick one,shall we? Yes take the case,Sir Must have been burning the midnight oil,Kenway A bit,do you like the idea,Sir? Yes I was very impressed most workman like,congratulations No,you are not pretending it won't be expensive in the first place but Yes,yes,quite BTW we haven't seen you at the club much,have we? No,Sir Mustn't overdo things One needs plenty of healthy exercise out her I know that Sir John was looking to you as a?? from the cricket field Yes,but aren't you going ahead with the scheme,Sir? I'm afraid it's out of the question That proved it would pay for itself On the basis of the last years prices Last year leaf bug ruined one fifth of the crop That send the price up to a point where it paid Come here a moment But surely the disease can't really be profitable Do you see that smoke coming up from the valley? -Yes -Do you know what that is? -No -10000 bags this year's coffee burning It's a new order from the government here We're getting a subsidy of so much ton on the quote we have to destroy That's fantastic Live in difficult times,the price must be kept at an economic level And the leaf bug may have obliged every year Exactly you see how it is Yes I see I am going to England this week for consultations Sir John will come back with me and see things for himself Confidentially it's bound to be a big economy wave Don't worry it won't affect you -Thank you,Sir -Not at all,very good Don't you want these? Yes,I suppose I might as well Remember what I said,all work and no play,you know? I'll remember Oh you must polish those late cuts of yours for Sir John Yes Yes Now try that Pedro Boss,that's terrific The apple jack does the trick don't forget the nutmeg Mr Kenway I don't how you think them up Hello What are you doing in this den of vice,somebody's birthday? -No,large scotch Pedro -Make it two-Three What's all the jollity? They terminated his contract,that's all What? In view of depression much regret unable to prolong engagement,best wishes for the future,forever my main faithfully I now propose to get supernatural cock eyes Such to get for getting four beans where only three grow before The first fruits of the visit of our illustrious managing director I'm sorry Brom really Well,I am too if the truth be known,thank you Vivian Once a world of plenty when scarcity pays better It makes me sick Coming Kenway it's time we left you know,we are leaving Sir John at four -I know -Like a lift? No,I got my own car,thanks,shan't be long It won't do to be late old boy,see you there Hi Pedro let's have the same again Difficult times One idea,of course fills our working hours to the exclusion of almost everything else coffee China or Indian Sir John? China,thank you But before I go into that I want to thank you all for the very warm welcome that you've had extended to me I thought perhaps you would like to come here like this for a little teatime chat After all an enterprise like ours there is in the natural course of things bound to be far too little contact between the managing director and the staff For myself I just want to throw out a few thoughts that might occurred to me A thought here,a thought there Some perhaps a trifle of visionary But nevertheless Thoughts Unfortunately we are in the throes of the depression I'm afraid I'm late Sorry Mr Kenway,Sir John Oh the cricketer How are you,Mr Kenway Not out,Sir Where was I? In the throes of depression,Sir Right,to say thank you We have been forced unfortunately to make certain cuts,I've taken one myself However,I feel quite sure that the economy have been effected without seriously impairing our efficiency And indeed,what about Bromhead? -What -The scientist you remember,Sir Yes,yes I remember quite As I am saying principal decision had to be made and we did what seemed to be best What I personally I'm quite certain was best Hear,hear To resume We find ourselves just now face to face with the problem for which in my opinion, there is only one solution Sack Bromhead I'm not interested in discussing Bromhead any further in any shape or form do I make myself clear? Yes Kindly refrain from interrupting Sir John,Kenway? Yeah The,the unfortunate,the unfortunate truth is today we grow more coffee than people will drink How are we to remedy that? May I make a suggestion? -No -Oh By salesmanship,marketing but if we look at our fellow countrymen what do we find? Their staple beverage is what? -Coffee? No -Beer? That is the matters,gentlemen,tea the average Englishman has increased his consumption to no less than six cups of tea per day What conclusion we draw from that? We're in the wrong business Out Excuse me Just a second man I'm just getting one to help you with the luggage Hello,Hyde,nice to see you again Nice to see you again,Sir Would you go to the man and hand him with the bags? Certainly,Sir -Hello,there -Hello -How is Calthorp? -All right,thanks Obviously your mission in life to greet me on the morrow of disaster And yours (?) is disaster Yes,we'll skip that Is the governor all right? He's upset,naturally -Is he here? -In the lounge with your Aunt I wonder what they are cooking Not that it is cast,I'm afraid What have we got down so far,Hubert? Steel,banking or the civil service Steels in the dot we are disarming like mad,Vivian will break any bank and as for the civil service -No? -No After having been kicked out of Oxford as an utterly hopeless case You proceed to reward your father old friend,the very man who got you the job by blackguarding him like a (?) in a bout of mordant drunkenness After which I sang the International in an abandoned manner and was sick on the carpet Twice What are you sniggering at,Hubert? -Emilia,I didn't make a murmur -Huber,you are a liar It saves awful lot of trouble sometimes Vivian is obviously not fit for Civilised Society Can't you get him into the City,Robert? Somehow I can't see him as stockbroker True he'd be running a bucket shop before you could say (?) I don't think you are fair,Angela, I'm sure the Lad is sound at heart I've been factiously indulgent and you've been a perfect fool This time he really must settle down to earn a living I'm aware of that,but,well,there is a question what Vivian wants to do I'm sure aunt Angela can set us at that as wildly irrelevant I should be surprised if he has the slightest notion of what he wants to do other than nothing What do you want,Vivian? -I don't know -There you are,you see Because I don't know I'm not going to pitch forth into any job chosen by a sticking a pin in a commercial directory with your eyes shut This time you'll do it,as you are instructed or lose your allowance With things as they are,your father can't possibly afford to keep you in idleness Blackmail aren't it?Tut-tut haven't you forgotten something? What? Uncle George He's been 20 years in his grave And yet his cash goes marching on You can't touch that money for another year I could borrow it tomorrow Don't be so ridiculous,Vivian Kindly be sensible and we resume our discussion as to your future I'm surprised at you,aunt Angela Millions of unemployed,and your only get some poor bloke sacked to make room for me Will you ask Vivian to be sensible,Robert? Dad and I have a five o'clock talk later You'd think you could get rid of me as easily as that? I know it's always hard work Robert This is too much -Hubert -Yes,dear We are going -What now -Yes before I have apoplexy We are wasting our time here Pity,never seen so much obstacles like that on my own board I feel deeply sorry for you,Robert waning and misguided moments when you spoiled that that millstone around your neck you weren't to knew what a rod your were pickling for your own back Seems we are travelling Toodle-oo! Before embarking on a strenuous business career it seemed to Vivian only sensible to explore the ground thoroughly first And of course to do that you had to have the right equipment (?)at Wimbledon (?) at Monte Cap January St Moritz (?) Kenway broke You found me a much misunderstood man,Kenway in jail The Police Sgt must not prepare to swear that Kenway was definitely drunk? A tribute to both his fair-mindness and the alcoholic capacity of the defendant Woodbrey I should fine 25Â£n with costs to one month and your licence will be suspended for two years Fogroy would pay 3 guineas cost and Kenway I should fine you 10 Â£ in costs which will include the price of one regulation Metropolitan police helmet Yes,Sir Pay your fines in the jailer's office Cheap at the price if you ask me William Hazleby Will you fix my account? Not you,Willie,pay the last or in you go I can't rake up more than 8 quid If I were you I should do the month They say is an experience everyone ought to have Vivian I could go to (?) Send you a roped ladder and a bottle of scotch I know the governor won't cough up he's raving mad already about what happened to his car Pay month will you? Gosh,I couldn't possibly But I am hanged so I know it is paid back -Mere detail,go on -Thanks a lot That was the last of the Mohicans on it,Vivian Sandy,what on earth are you doing here Are you..?

We've never met before I see Are you a charitable organisation? No Who are you? I'm Rikki Krausner Are you responsible for all this? -Yes -May I ask why? Because I'm very much in love with you Now let me get this straight,you know me,but I don't know you and you are in very much in love with me but we haven't met before Yes Would you like me to explain? Might be a contribution But first I insist that you eat because I know you are very hungry Thanks so much Now it isn't easy to know where to start I think it was about two or three years ago when I was,at what you call, a finishing school in Switzerland And then one night two of the other girls and myself we went to Cinema to see Charles Boyer And there was news picture of an auto race in Ireland The After TT Yes,you were in it,you spoke for the microphone That was the first time I saw you and heard your voice And I soon forgot about Charles Boyer Gratified Highly gratified And in our next year I could make a vacation in England and I went to see you at Brookward Brooklands I hope,Brookward is a cemetery Brooklands and there I saw you quite close,as close as I am to you now And then I knew Knew what? That I could never love anyone else Please go on Next,next year when I could do as I please I went to Nice just to see you again And did you? Often I found out where you were staying and the times you went in and out The places you used to go to,I watched you many times and you didn't know Sitting outside the cafÃ©s Look the CafÃ© on the corner of Rue Sacouf, every morning at eleven -Yes -Yes Fondly gave me a whisky soda I can see you there now And the I heard you came to Vienna for the Grand Prix I was so happy I can't tell you,because you see,I don't live so far away And the next day already I was here waiting for you Why didn't you speak to me? That wouldn't have been proper I beg you pardon,I should have known of that yes And then somebody told me that your party was already leaving So I went,you know,I went here all the way And when the manager told me that you had not gone and he thought he had to put you in jail I was so happy ,I nearly cried Thank you very much Because you see this is my chance to meet you and to help you Do you think you could love me just a little,Mr Kenway While here and now? I wouldn't expect it at first but lets talk about it when we are married for just for a little while I gather you take me (?) as tried Look,I'm 21 and not ugly And had no lovers and a good education I'm a very fine cook and my father is well off And you love him? Oh,I do I do Now supposing we skip the fairy tales and come to the point What? To begin with there is no Rue Sacouf in Nice and therefore no cafÃ© and no whisky soda You deceive me,you won't telling the truth I know the genius of your sex for (?) more situations as of the injured party May I remind you you just unloaded the biggest pack of lies I ever heard in my life Oh Lord Look,can I get you anything? Handkerchief Better now Now what is all this about I can tell you in two sentences The Nazis are in Vienna,I'm half Jewish I am sorry My father so it coming long ago and begged me to leave him Now it's too late Unless Never mind now Unless you can acquire British nationality Yes,my father had the idea, he found out that you were left stranded here he said it was a chance from heaven and He implored me Oh yes I see I am sorry Well you couldn't have known I said to myself the English are not like us When they make a marriage for money they must persuade themselves that is a great romance there is a word for that in English -Humbug -That's it That's the word But I didn't deceive you -So we say good bye -Wait a minute You know a less romantic approach might have proved more fruitful Please Well no one responds quicker to a sound business proposition than we British humbugs The point is,is it sound? Let's go into it,have some more wine You mean you are willing Wait a minute we must have some plan,what? We pay what you owe here and all your debts in Vienna And of course all the travel expenses Naturally Sounds quite promising -Yes but unfortunately -What? Unfortunately while I am anxious to get back to England My creditors there are even more anxious to see me You mean you have debts there too? One in particular an unreasonable type You owe him much money? Oh two three thousands My father will pay it I know he will You wouldn't be able to take the money out of the country Oh yes he has funds in Paris and London,his agents will see to it -Sure? -Yes Splendid Yes but honestly you do not how to scared I've been in the least tied down Once we get to London we need never meet again Good,yes Suppose you fell in love with me? That's ridiculous Reassuring if not flattering Well? No I couldn't OK it's a deal I promise I'll be no trouble You are a fine little thing I think you said this was a business proposition,Mr Kenway? No,merely going for the stamp on the marriage contract,however However it has to be a gentleman's agreement Now here's to the firm of Kenway and What did you say your name was? You think you'd be comfortable here? Thank you it's a lovely suite Must be very expensive I thought you liked something in the style you were used to you know Can I get you anything? Why I don't think so I'd better be pushing off Good Bye nice to have known you I'll be in touch with you about the divorce Mr Shivers has been instructed to pay what you owe to the person you named Yes,so you said,thanks very much,very satisfactory Good Luck I suppose you had a dinner appointment Nothing in particular,why? I don't know I was just thinking it's rather silly to go so quickly when well it's half past seven and nearly time for dinner I was merely observing my side of the agreement Of course I would be very angry if you weren't I just wanted to ask you what kind of work I could find in London? That's different of course -Oh yes -Oh yes I'm sure the discussion over dinner table was quite the meaning of the contract Certainly In that case with your permission I'll have the dinner -Do -Room service Mr Kenway I put your bags in the bedroom as you asked Good Night Sir Room Service Will you send a waiter up to 52 -Good Morning,Sir -Good Morning -Good Morning,Sir -Good Morning Mayfair 5504 please -Anything else,sir? -No,that's all,thank you It's that you Fogroy,yes it's me I'm back Stay at the Grand No,cash Now listen,old boy,take a firm hold of something Well,hold that You are going to get money I owed you In fact you can get three times as much Of course I'm not tight 3000 Â£ No,not interest your full tour is mine It'll come by cheque from Shiver's Bank Hang on for bounce and ring it round on Friday it should be through by then Foggy ring before you come What? Well,as a matter As a matter of fact on second thought I don't think I'll have the roses Well hold them too And a Hello I'll come round and chose the orchid myself Orchids you shouldn't You weren't supposed to hear that Vivian how long are we going to stay in this hotel? A week or two,I suppose,why? We are spending so much money This is our honeymoon It's true you don't owe anything but you haven't got any money I get that fixed up without you What's the matter? I can't help feeling worried All right,darling,we'll go carefully Come on and put your hat on and we'll go and celebrate Celebrate? What? Our decision to go carefully,come on Come in Foggy Oh hello I thought it was a friend of mine You see your mistake I do indeed Could I see you a moment? Yes,of course,come in Quite a time since we met -You look just the same -So do you I expect you guessed why I called Show me once more the error of my ways Not likely to do that again Splendid,have a drink? I haven't time Why haven't you been home? Well,I haven't noticed any desire as far as the family for a get together A more sensitive man might have found a response to it let out describing in the extreme He seemed to have improved since then Considerably How's dad? Is he well? He knows you are back and he is worried about not hearing from you You might have called Yes but it was not very convenient He knew there must be some powerful reason Don't you allow me in a rather delicate situation just now Oh I'm so sorry Hello darling Come in I didn't know you had a visitor -Where are you off to? -To the hairdresser This is Miss Calthorp my father's secretary Mrs Kenway How do you Will you be long? -Not very,good bye Miss Calthorp -Good Bye Perhaps I should explain In hardly think it's necessary in spite of my having led so sheltered life -I'm sorry I intruded -Not in the least I only thought you ought to know your father is leaving this afternoon for Cornwall Not Angela? -Yes -Dear Auntie You're going to? Excuse me -Hello -Hello Vivian Hello Foggy -Just hold the line a minute -It's all right,I'll have to go now anyway Give Dad my love and tell him I'll try to get down I will,good bye Oh Jenny BTW she really is Mrs Kenway What? The marriage licence is nicely printed in two languages Congratulations Thanks -Vivian are you still there? -I'm sorry where the devil are you? -Downstairs -Come up you fool Come in old boy Come in Foggy -A pretty dame been here? -Yes Pretty Get that cheque from Shivers bank all right? Yes everything was all right thank you very much I can do with mine Worried about about collecting cash isn't it? But effective Oh yes,yes,plenty surprise for me I must say Things are looking up,right? Where we are now -Up the navy -Shiver's Bank I suppose you couldn't let me have a couple of thousands? -What for? -Shark and the city Buy Manganese red hot tip I bought something in shilling margin the other day -My fellow they are bound to go up -Have they? -No in the middle it dropped a bud -You lost your money you twerp It was a temporary set back,they'll rather go Thank goodness you covered it That's precisely why I am up to those 2000 Â£ -So certain this time,Vivian -Can't be done,absolutely (?) -I should keep it if I could -Keep it? Yes I think there is some misunderstanding,old boy -I was after another 2000Â£ -Another what? I've just explained, we lost the third -We? -I thought I made that quite clear You used my money I put up a third you know You crook I must say I thought you'd take it in a more sporting spirit Sporting spirit? It's all I depend on,when can you pay it back? -Within six months I should think -Six months,what's the good of that I like to remind you,you owed me a 1000 for nearly a couple of years I've only owed you 2000Â£ for 24 hours I borrowed it,not embezzled it Oh you're putting a great strain on my forbearance 2000 Â£ down the drain Worth ?? and you're letting me down I might as well as never invented the debt What am I going to do know,heavens knows That's certainly taught me a lesson I should never extend a helping hand to friend again Rikki The fellow is an eccentric -Rikki -Don't come near me -Now listen -You never owed that money I owed part of it I heard what you said it was a trick to get more Be reasonable was there anything to stop me asking you a sum down quite openly in the first place What's the difference? Only one of good faith for you it's not important Can't you see I'm the victim of circumstances just as much as you are That's was my father's money, it was almost all he had in the world What? When you told me your price I was afraid at first it was more than he could pay It was just enough I see you lied Well I thought if I told you the truth in Vienna,you'd send me away I thought you hadn't got any money either Let alone(?) Not a cent between us,I'm back as I was in Vienna,now there are two of us locked up This is what comes being over scrupulous,it's the last straw Porter will you send somebody up for the luggage please And give me a taxi I might point out how lucky to be able to leave the hotel with your bags until some arrangements have been made about the bill I've paid it -When? -This morning -How? -I sold my ring Thank you porter -Rikki -Yes You make me feel ashamed Do I? Yes,you're quite right to go I asked for it,I'm sorry Oh Viv Rikki Don't don't don't don't I do things without thinking I'm a selfish hog Only sometimes You're a funny little thing Did I ever tell you that? Funny peculiar? Or funny ha-ha? Bit of each Now what are we going to do? I can't think -We can't stay here -How right you are -Cornwall? -Please Father has just gone down there, we're going to stay with him for a bit I've always wanted to meet him -We've forgotten something -What? How are we going to pay our fares to Cornwall? -That's a point -Oh dear I know What We'll hire a car from Godfrey Davis On credit Rather a cramped for space I'm afraid but I hope you find it comfortable I suspect Mrs Kenway would like to see her room Oh yes it's a good idea you take her up,my dear Thank you -Tea will be ready in a few minutes -Thank you What did you say the name was? -Rikki -Rikki? Short for something? No I don't think so dad -Foreign I gather -Austria I took it for granted you'd marry a British girl somehow Those ideas are pretty old fashioned today,dad Is it old fashioned to expect to meet the lady before one's son gets married? -Well,it all happened a bit suddenly -You didn't.. Have to marry her? Oh no sorry my dear I suppose one must be grateful for small mercies How did you meet her? -Vienna you know -I see Are you in love with her? Why do one usually marry? I don't know I only married once I never looked at anyone else But they have different ideas on the Continent A marriage is for love is not entirely unknown outside the British Isles Possibly We don't know each other very well,do we my boy? No I suppose not Awfully nice to see you again,Dad Well,now you are here I'll hope you stay for a while -I'd like to -Good And let's hope Oh,Vivian this is such a pretty little house I'm glad you liked it I think in England you have the most wonderful houses in the world That's very nice of you to say so I suppose it's very old Not enormously 1660 or thereabouts Would you like me to show you around? I should love it to We've just time before tea Come along Rikki Coming Vivian? Sure -She's very sweet,Vivian -Isn't she? She deserves a better fate I've no intention of being her fate, more consideration for the girl You are married aren't you? -Yes -Why speak I really can't quite have this conversation indefinitely Vivian,what's behind all this exactly? Mind you own confounded business You are your own worst enemy,aren't you? If you don't give yourself a chance Why did you say that? I hadn't any idea Shortly I suppose I was as much to blame for it, for what happened afterwards Looking back I don't know how I could have been so blinded Rikki neither of us thought of her Neither of us put ourselves in her place Romantic,sensitive,pushed more and more into the background And loving Vivian with all her heart Jenny Dear No Vivian Don't be long,my dear,it's near tea time How this happened Just happened that's all It's got to stop Listen Jenny There is no future in it, Vivian,certainly not for me I know that because I know you You must leave here at once and take Rikki with you Terribly unfair to her She mustn't ever hear of it Vivian,quickly,Vivian Vivian Vivian What is it? What's the matter? It's Rikki help her with the boat she's swimming out to sea -What happened? -I shouted to her She just kept on swimming Must be a long way out now There she is,look Get Rikki Rikki Let me go Rikki Let's get back Rikki Get some brandy and blankets quick Why did you come after me? I didn't want it Vivian how is she? Rikki Now please Rikki Don't touch me,I couldn't bear you to touch me You are quite safe now my dear Rikki I was thinking What I said in Vienna I said to fall in love with you the idea was ridiculous and the now I actually We'd better take her upstairs and get her things off You Jennifer Do you know what kind of a man it is you are in love with? -Please -And you what a son you have He married me to get away from Vienna when the Nazis came I know I was responsible I begged him He gave me his name and my father paid his debts If only it could had stopped at that But I never knew that he would live with me because it amuse him I told myself it was something more But it started one way would end in another But all the time he was cheating And spend things Spending until I had to sell my ring to pay what we owed But still I was happy when we came down here You were so sweet to me So was Vivian to begin with Then I saw that he was bored when I was with him And then when he was without me, he never thought of me at all But I said to myself,perhaps he'll change And then today I found out that all the time it was you he loved And I thought I get out of it all I will die You seem to be determined to ruin your life Well,that's your business But I don't care what circumstances you married her in you got obligations to Rikki not as much as me Yes dad Not much I can do myself,it'll have to be a family matter You and I will drive up with Rikki in the morning -Is that understood? -Anything you say dad Very well Jennifer will stay down here That's enough What the devil do you think you're doing You've been drinking all morning and you have to drive to London You missed your vocation,Jenny You should be giving readings in(?) little by little to the ladies of the parish Are you ready Vivian? All right Hello Yes,that's right it's his house sorry I run out of breath,but Kenway is not here at the moment Yes this is Miss Calthorp speaking What? Hospital? Are they badly hurt? Yes I can come,how do I get there? Yes Just a moment I'll write it down Jennifer,Jennifer The doctor has seen your wife,Mr Kenway You'll be glad to know it is nothing serious,she is in no danger My father? May I see him please? Dad Hello Vivian I'm sorry You've Hurt your hand I knew I was taking risks, I shouldn't have taken it Your wife is asking to see you,Mr Kenway Mr Kenway His father's estate was disposed of, and later Rikki obtained her divorce I never saw her again As for Vivian,he simply disappeared It was as if he had walked from that hospital straight out of all our lives Not bad job,three cylinders, brand new front tires Well,that's a bit worn 29 Â£ -You like a drive? -No thanks Good Morning,Madam,can I interest you in our universal chemical cleaner perhaps you like a demonstration,won't take more than a minute of your time Not today Time That's the fourth time Fifth Smell of beer too Whisky Next time I chose a sober partner And get Percy to dance with me OK by me suits me perfect What can you expect for a bob Fred Astaire? May I have this dance please What are you doing here? I wanted to see you Then I can't pretend a compromise I've paid my ticket do you want me to complain to the management? Light conversation is usual during the dance I make no extra charge Floor is good and the band might be worse Better to imagine that it might I've been trying to find you for months Jenny,get out of here leave me alone I'm no good to you and anyone else including myself That sounds dangerously like self pity,Vivian He left me to take him away without a word Didn't ask or laughed at me as he would have done once I think that frightened me more than anything else I had the sentimental idea that away in the country he would recover himself For longer than I care to think we were strangers He led a mental life of his own, which I could never enter Life which revolved monotonously Bare one moment in a hospital ward Must they play that thing all the time why can't they switch it off I despaired of everything able to help him though I never showed it Then one morning quite early Vivian Vivian Vivian where are you? See what you done to me a domesticated character Just a household drudge It's a tragedy -Jenny -Yes? Thank you,for everything, you've been wonderful Have I? I always remember That sounds almost a farewell speech It is -You are going? -Yes -When? -Tomorrow I see You've put me on my feet again and helped me see things straight Looking at it quite unemotionally the truth is My type is becoming obsolete Can't compete with the international situation Not even new anymore ?? produced us and champagne gone flat and may going out with the thirties Nothing to show for except Cirrhosis of the liver and lot of wasted time -What about us? -Us? You and me No future in that you said so yourself After all it was over almost before it was started I suppose so What I mean as long as look at things calmly and dispassionately it's the only way Of course What's the matter? You are going on drying the same plate You were washing it Yes we don't seem to have got very far,do we? One plate Jenny don't I always making an awful fool of myself No you're not Jenny I can't let you go I never asked you to I'll make you a rotten husband I know Will you marry me Jenny? -Yes -Saturday? -Oh,no -Why not? I've nothing to wear -Is that important? -It's vital We'll go out and get something When? -First train tomorrow -All right You do love me,don't you,Vivian? Yes, Jenny Calmly and dispassionately? No,nothing like that Shattered Go off now Bye Vivian see you tomorrow Good Bye Jenny darling I follow you down the road I can still see his car winding away from me down that country lane Things smaller and smaller I don't know quite what happened to Vivian as he drove away from me I don't know what thoughts must have passed through his mind I know he loved me And believed for a little while we could made each other happy And then perhaps quite suddenly he found himself again Knew he hadn't changed And so for once he made a choice against his own wish for my sake I say perhaps I'll never really know Because all his letters said was Sorry Darling I can't That is his car Yes,Sir,what's left -Where is he? -They carried him over Company HQ This way,Sir I knew Kenway's father well MP in my constituency,good party man That was his son His tank encountered two Nazi groups Apparently they've been holding this bridge approaches the best part of four hours -Is that right Cpl? -Quite right,Sgt Well done Cpl When did he die? Just after the first light,Sir, when we moved over -You were with him during the time Cpl -Yes Sir Nothing you could have done I suppose Afraid not,Sir Was he conscious? Oh yes Sir Did he say anything? Something about beginning with Vivier I didn't catch the rest It's men like him that made it possible I think he was referring to the champagne,Sir He had a bottle in his hand at the time Old Viv died as he lives drinking champagne and never paid for That's a remark in a very bad taste,Sgt Come along Cpl He would have appreciated it Wouldn't you old lad? Up the navy Viv Yes that was Vivian Peace a misfit a man who wanted to live dangerously in a world that wanted to play safe In war a(?)soldier,perhaps that was his destiny? Subtitles by Seglora
