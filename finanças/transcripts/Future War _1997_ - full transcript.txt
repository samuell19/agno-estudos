This place looks like a maze. Look over there. We found them, down there Let's get them, I'm right behind you Anne Hold on man! Very deep. Walk along there. Four days ago, a fire fell from the sky. And it brought a man, who would change my life forever. But also came a pack of dinosaur-like creatures, in various ages, shapes, sizes, and its' masters. For all the questions I had about the heavens, All it brought was hell on earth. Come, come, come! Hurry, hurry! Shit! Let's go! From the future traveled a master race of Cyborgs They made abductions from Earth's past. The dinosaurs were trained as trackers The humans were bred as slaves Now a runaway slave escapes to a place his people call heaven... we know it as earth Future War Four days earlier God he is alive, Somebody help me! Please, somebody help me! In the car. A man. What's going on? There's an injured man in the car. He needs our help. Hey, Oscar, we need your help outside Anne, sometimes it is good. What do we've got? Homeless guy with his throat ripped out. By what? Figure mountain lion, grizzlies come out of the hills in search of food. Found this poor bastard instead. Just great, has anybody called the Humane Society, the Zoo? They're sending some people out. Captain. We've got something here. We found this. What the hell made that? Jesus, I think I should be wearing a tie. Don't give me a hard time, okay? - I think you broke a bone. - I mean, what is this bullshit? I mean, no special favors. Okay, anything you say, Jesus Christ! And watch that language, God damn it. Okay, okay. So now you don't like my cooking, Sister? No, I'm just not hungry. Thanks for cooking. Hey, I have some nice chocolate cakes, some mocha almond ice cream. - Hey, I'll have some. - No, thanks, I think I'll pass. This is worse than I thought. You're at home now. So what's going on? Maybe I'm not meant for this. Maybe I'm meant for something else. Maybe. Sister Superior says that I'm having a crisis of faith. Maybe? Well, what do you think? Maybe. Come on, I'm looking for some counseling here Fred. Hey, I cut meat you know? Personally, I think you're getting a little stupid about that kid that bought the farm. Remember Jimmy Ho? Remember Lena Melter? I heard about Terry. Sorry. - How is our guest? - Unconscious. Look what I found. Maybe he's into some kind of bondage thing. Smart guy. I patched up what I could without X rays. I'll know more tomorrow. Why don't you have a seat, nurse? No, no time I got to get back to the clinic. Terrible habits, girl. It's good to have you back, Anne. Thanks. I'll stop by after my shift is okay. Bye. You want something, Max? Uncle Fred says you don't have a husband. Uncle Fred says you're going to shave your head and turn to a penguin. - A penguin? - Can I watch? It was a metaphor. He says you don't know what you're doing, he says... ...time to go to bed now. Go brush your teeth. Go on. - Say good night. - Good night. You're right you know... Come on Annie, I was just talking. Two days ago, I was so sure. And what today you don't know nothing? Look, when we met, you were hiding from a pimp. You just did a month in the joint. You were suicidal and addicted. Keeping you in here was hard. Garina was killed by some guy, wired up on the drugs he bought from me. Come on now Annie - Sure looks like I pulled the trigger. - But you didn't, he did. You came here and got clean. You helped other girls off the junk and off the street. That means something, Annie. I'm going to go up north and visit an aunt. You take care of that guy. Listen kid. Everything's going to work out just fine. You'll see. Hope so. - Guess he is awake. - Yeah. - How's he doing? - Okay. I try to talk to him. English, spanish. He doesn't talk, but I think he understands. I left him in the daycare room. Let's go have a look. Maybe he can tell us what this thing is for. Where are you going? I'm going to go to my room and pack. I want to be on the road by twelve. Aren't you going to stay help us with this guy, he is yours. Yes, sister come on. You're good at this kind of thing. Hi there. I'm Fred. That's Romero and that Sister Anne. Hey, man, what's your story? You understand English? Leave me alone with him. Bullshit, this guy might be a psycho. And what do you think? He's going to open up ot you in there? Why not? I'm a likable guy. Fred, his collar. You just say the word, I'll be right outside the door. German dots, huh? Hey, you like that? The pictures in the magazines. USA. Sounds like a great place. It's Fishers. You can hear us and I think you understand us. You want to give us a break? If not, well, enjoy. Well, thank you for not killing me. There's something wrong with your throat. Yeah. You can understand us, but you can't talk, right? Is that it? Is that it? When I nod my head like this, I mean yes. Is that it, Yes? And when I shake my head no, I mean no, right? Yes. Where are you from? Hey, maybe you can write. Okay. Not a clue. Hey, the map. Let's see here. No. Okay. Here. I'm sorry, I... Oh up here. Hi, my name is Max Hi, my name is Max Where are you going? I'm gonna go visit an aunt I have up north. I just came to say goodbye. So, goodbye. Hey, don't worry, they're gonna take good care of... Well, maybe now you can tell me where you come from. You. Here. I. Come. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. Max, did you show him any space videos? Yeah - No! They're my friends! - Run! Must run! God. Thank you. I think we've outrun them. You are a penguin? No. I'm a sister, not a penguin. You know, how is it you know English today? when you didn't know English yesterday? It was hard for me to understand him. For all the problems I had, maybe I just didn't want to be a part of his. He explained to me how quickly he could learn, how his vocal chords needed to adjust to speak our tongue, and how he had heard our words before. His eyes were so honest but, still there was a part of him that I didn't trust. - And who are you? - A tool. And you come from? Never mind. You're human. I am a tool. And you're from up there? The Palgaon, the first were harvested from this world like trackers long ago. We are used to build because we have these. The Masters do not have these. They can make their own thumbs, but they just don't want to? They want us to do the work. Yeah, I knew a few pimps in my time. Pimps? You wouldn't understand. Like the Bible says, my thoughts are not your thoughts. Neither are your ways, my ways, says the Lord. This is a con. No, no. No trick. No lie. How does an alien bred human know quotes from the Bible? In the world where I am from, in the place where the tools are kept are unscheduled words. A phrase told in darkness. I have heard your language before. Well, explain this so I can understand it. This place was the most important story. Our dream. Our heaven. And now I'm free. He was so honest. I explained to him about the heavens. I was studying to become a nun. but now I'm having second thoughts. When I was younger I ran away and I have a past that I'm not proud of. I found the church and they helped me. But just recently a friend of mine died of a drug overdose. I blame myself for her death. I don't know. I feel somehow responsible. Sister Anne, are you alright? Ever since yesterday at the burial, I've been asking myself... what I missed. You didn't miss anything my dear. It wasn't your fault. How come I wasn't taken? Because you weren't. And that's that. I don't know if I'm going to take my final vows next week. Because of Terry Joe? That's what this is? You knew what I was before I came here. Well you had a record. So did Mary Magdalene. I was a whore doing tricks in back alleys, I sold drugs. Sister Anne, that was then. I'm very proud of you now. I'm not. Well then, we have a problem here don't we? She was smart sister good, tough. Sister. - I should have been there for her. - Sister Anne why don't you take the weekend? Visit your friends and family? Perfection is not one of the requirements. Faith is. Sister, do you believe in signs? I guess I do. Keep your eyes open. God always answers prayers. What about the tracker? What happens now? The tracker will rest, then go back, to where it first found us. I don't believe this. Are you going back? Yes. But the tracker has her scent now. Tough. If I go with you, it will find me. Well then you better get back on the train. I do not understand. This is something I have to do. I'd like to give you some big words of wisdom. But I just don't have any. My mind is blank. You do what you have to do. Goodbye. What are you doing? Doing what I believe to. And what's that? I'm going with you. Look, let's get this straight. I work alone. Alone by myself. I want to be alone. Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off. I don't want to talk about this. The number you have reached is not in service. - Heaven is a mess, isn't it? - I don't know, I like it. How many people got murdered today? Or raped, Beaten, Oh missing? - You're upset. - Yeah, I'm upset. - But you want to help your friends. - That's different. I know them. You don't know me. You help me. Greater love has no man than this. Than a man lay down his life for his friend. I gotta get out of here. That is what I want to be. - What? - A man. You are a man. No. I mean greater love. That kind of man. You better be careful what you wish for. We're going on the assumption that some animal, out of the hills has gone on a rampage. The body found here at Third Street makes four deaths in six hours. This creature knows where it's going. I want cars posted all along this route. Stay in close radio contact at all times. Let's go. - Is God out there? - God of Gods. King of Kings. You don't even know what you're saying, do you? You don't. What's out there? Is Heaven out there? Earth is Heaven. And the supreme being is what? Handlers, masters. Not them. Greater than them. Help! Western Division, Officer Fry speaking. How may I help you? Help. Officer. Anybody. Help us, please. 10-4, Unit 41-K. 905-V in progress. Fifth Street Warehouse. Code 3. Over. This is WCNG reporter C.N. McGill, reporting to you live from the Fifth Street Warehouse where there has been a reported animal attack. Shit! More updates as they occur. Captain, there are employees still in the plant in the back of a storeroom. Joey, lead in the tactical team. You take the point. Hey, Joey. Captain wants to know if you've spotted that bear yet. No, sir. Try a picnic basket, boo-boo. I just found blood staines surface right here... You sure it's not ketchup? No, sir. It's real. Focus on Polaris. What happened? You two, follow me. Joey! Joey, where are you, man? Maybe I should let him go in by himself. - Otis, we got something here. - What is it? It's Joey. What's left of it? All patrols, northeast corner. Jesus. Leo. Sometimes tools will run. When the trackers catch them, it's like this. Hey, it's coming back. Don't shoot, boys. Behind him. We might hit each other. - Can you kill it with that? - Yeah, here. Cut here. It's the softest place. Just a moment. Don't miss. Where are you going? Get down! Captain Polaris. Captain Polaris? Are you there? Captain Polaris? We got the bastard, Sergeant. We've got a situation here. What do you mean, you've got a situation? I mean we've got more monster sightings in the city. More? How could there be more? They come in packs. They're after me. They will continue to hurt people, until they find me. Bring me to them. Otis Smitty, place this man under arrest. He just saved you and everybody in the building from that thing. He's not a criminal. He won't run away this time. Now if you'll excuse us, Sister Anne, your friend's got some questions to answer. How did you know who I was? Fred Burroughs told us how he got you to give him a ride, - but don't worry, you're free to go. - What? An information blackout out has fallen on the city. Highly placed sources have noted a freak accident has cost enough for oil animals to escape from the zoo. They are extremely dangerous. They don't care about us, Annie. They just cut us loose. Is Terry Joe's brother still running with the 12th Street gang? Yeah. Can you set up a meeting with me? What for? So he can shoot me. You got something to say to me? Sorry about Terry, Joe. I'm sorry. She had deep thoughts, you know? I need your help. For what? Monsters in the hood? So, Dr. Tanaga, what's your honest opinion? What's there not to believe? A race of transplanted humans bred on another planet. One of them escapes, returns to his ancestral world. And these dinosaurs and their masters are here to bring him back. Personally, I think he's nuts. I've seen these dinosaurs, doctor. They're real. Maybe his story is real too. - Captain. - Federal agents. We're taking over this case as of right now. - Under whose authority? - National security Captain, You hereby relieved of this case and ordered to leave the room now. I'm taking this to the commissioner. I don't believe this. Can you explain this? I said, can you explain this? They're trackers. When the tracker was killed, what happened to his body? Self destruct. So they leave no trace. Like this. You look so human. I'm a man. So you say. Bring the doctor back in, we can do the testing in here. Well... it appears to be a transmitter of some kind. I'm taking it to the lab. Can you all leave the room, please? I apologize for this humiliation. It's my job. I have a job too. I'm a tool. My life is my job. Mine too. Barbara here, take a look at this. and send the results to my office, please. Barbara I heard a noise that... Willis, Dexter we're taking him to Lane today What is it? You know? Don't you Freeze damn it! Can't count on the police. Can't count on anybody. What do you want us to do? We can stop these things together. Yeah, right. Together. Together means we do all the work, right? No! we're out of here. Get your ass down. Sister's right. Nobody's going to help us with that. They got the neighborhood by the balls, man. Don't scare us. Don't be out of the street either. That's enough. Let them go. They don't have to help us if they don't want to. You saying we're afraid? No, but there's going to be a fight. And it's going to be bad. And it's going to be bloody. So where do we find these things? They're always near water. That could be a lot of places. Then we do it the hard way, and we look. Come here. Fresh tracks. Very deep. Run! Let's get on the truck! Roger. God, we're going to be massacred. We're going to have to take a stand tonight. You will attack the trackers? - You got something better? - Listen, they're after me. - I will give myself to them. - That's no plan. But they are after him. Can these things die? Yeah. Come on, man you're talking heavy artillery, We can't get anything like that. Yes, we can. Conroy, I need some weapons. Some real heavy stuff. Hey, Annie. Hello, Chadwick. We go back, don't we? We go way back. I'm not here to talk about that. Hold it. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean nothing. I've come to contribute. Here. What's this? - Found a high-grade white. - Killing dose? Should have killed a whole city block. And there's this. Everyone needs some finance, babe. - Who is that? - None of your business. Guess you gotta take the bad with the good, huh? Good night, sister. Conroy! I got the money. Now can you help? Sure, Annie. Fine, get in. Wait, this is it. Let's go. Go, go in here, go come on, go. Go, go. Look over there? It seems to be all clear. We found him, down there. We have to draw them out of there. I know. Are you scared? Yeah. Greater love hath no man, remember? I do. Let's do this thing. Come on, Over here. Come on, come on let's go! Take them! Take them! Four days ago, a fire fell from the sky, and I thought everything it brought would just extinguish and burn away. Now for all the questions and doubts I had, everything seemed so clear. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Dear sister, do you now want to commit to this bond of perpetual devotion? Yes, I will. Do you want to strive for the perfect love of God and of your neighbor following the Spirit of the Gospel? Yes, I will. By the grace of the Holy Spirit, do you want to generously spend your whole life in the service of God's people? By the grace of the Holy Spirit, do you want to spend your whole life in the service of God's people? Yes, I will. The ambulance is here. So much to learn. So much. You're going to be alright, okay? I learned from you. I once. Greater love has no man than this. I want to be that man. You are. You are. You ask me if there's a heaven out there. I know. Four days ago a fire fell from the sky. Everything he wanted was everything I needed. - Hellstreet Rehab, how can I help you? - Hello, I'm a runaway, I'm all alone. Can you help me, please? I'd like to share a quote from the Bible with you. Now that passion for living and giving life, runs deeply and forever in my heart
