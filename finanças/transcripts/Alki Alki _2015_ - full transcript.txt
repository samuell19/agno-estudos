ALKY, ALKY Max called. -Rubbish. I'd better go over. Anika, stay here. Wait, the blanket. -Anika, stay. Sleep well. I love you. -You, too. Sleep well. Tobias and DeBottle Are fond of one another To Tobias, DeBottle Is more than a brother Together they're as sweet As petunias Ernie and Bert All for one and hallelujah! And if Tobias feels shy DeBottle spares him the knocks Tobias needs DeBottle Like Kirk needs Spock And should he forget where he's at DeBottle holds his hand And gives him succour, negates the furore Leaves him feeling grand And if Tobias is serious DeBottle makes him laugh Yippi-yai-yippi Let's keep at it till we barf Let us rock to break the block Let it go, don't be slow Raise some Cain, go insane And I love you And it's a fitting epitaph... When I say the two of them Will always be in love The car's got a dent. -What? The car's got a dent. Tobias, it's dented. It's not huge, but... I guess it was a cyclist. Maybe it was drunk-driven. Are you going to school or not? Right, you've got to go. Have a nice day. Wait, your satchel. Bye, dear. Bye. Off we go. Bye, big boy. Yes, thank you, Ms Brand for visiting us at short notice in our holy hall. My pleasure. -Help yourself. It's all fresh and delicious. -Bubbly? God no! -It's a bit early, in any case, Tobias. Come on. To celebrate. As I was saying, I'd be overjoyed if we were awarded this project. There's family history, I grew up on an estate in Eisenach. My parents are still there. It's been renovated, but not to my satisfaction. My parents said, you're an architect, show us how it's done. And this is my chance. So let us consider our problem child. We are dealing with a WHHGT... 18/21. If we give the picture a good look, this is no eye candy. -No. But we have aces up our sleeves. This is, A: location: Imagine, from the 10th floor... you can see the TV Tower and Potsdamer Platz... The entire panorama of a European capital. And I promise you, from its size alone this will be the largest low-energy building in all Germany. So, Ms Brand, now comes the moment where we reach for our pens. Black, red? -Red. Red for... big glass surfaces, huh? How truly charming. -Lifts. Charming! -Just let your imagination take wings! Big, big, really big. Do it big. You're great, Ms Brand. -You are so... Glass elevators? Glass elevators, yes? Tobias. Tobias... Tobias! He worked throughout the night. You're on. Financing. I can't get it financed. What? -It's great, but... We're discussing the variant with alterations but no external lifts. Could you give us the figures, it's the second variant. It's the third one. -Without lifts. We discussed it. That's the carrot. -What? Well... the carrot. -It was a tricky job. Here we go. A carrot, right? -What carrot? You've got the wrong address. We'll get a master painter, paint the facade, put a carrot on it and it's fine. Tobias... -Or we could pull it down instead. Tobias, it's not about the carrot. Give us the agreed financial concept. How much money do you have? Just give us the figures. -20,000 for the painting and that's it. We're an architecture firm. -Right. Have a bite. Ms Brand, one moment please. Tobias, don't be like that at meetings. That was important. Here. Relax. There'll be trouble. -You did brilliantly. My applause. Bravo. But it's true. -What is? We said we'd keep the A3 variant to the end. Who gives a shit? I want a commission. Any commission. Now we have nothing. Check the books. Empty. -We said no A3! We said it's an emergency measure. Nice you're awake. I don't give a shit if it's a four-million job or whatever. But I do care 'cause I don't paint carrots on prefabs! Look out the window! It's all monstrous! All Berlin is! That's not why I qualified. -Then bomb the inner city! I want to make changes! -Tobias! Pull yourself together. -I'm drawing a carrot here. I'll paint an asshole on it, too. A huge one. I'll pull it all down and build a pigsty. You see? That's the difference! I won't do anything for money. I don't know if you examined your pension plan recently. Well, chum? You're no longer 25, you can't rearrange the world. I've had it up to here, friend! Grow up! -You jaded asshole! Thanks again for screwing up. He's lost it, hasn't he? Papa? -Yes? I don't get my homework. -Papa, he doesn't get his homework. Determine the Y-points along this normal parabola. Y-points? What Y-points? Er... point one is... one minus two... Can't Clara stop playing... -No, she does 45 minutes. It's annoying. Can't she play quietly? Hannes, be patient. I'm helping. -I'm hungry! I don't understand it, anyway. -Max, just coming... What, F? -This one. Move that. The graph of function F... With F, brackets X divided by X2 plus E. -Max, stop it. Not my pyjamas. -Would you sit down? Stop! It's easy. Tobias, show him. Tobias, you can do it. You can do it, Tobias. Christ! Shut your trap! Shut it! -What? Let me be. Get lost! So what do you want to know? -What I do with Y. You're it! -Max! You're it! -Clara, could you play downstairs? You're it. -This won't do. You're causing such... When Anika gets in... Max, please, get dressed. Max! Get dressed. Stop it! I told you to stop. Quit it. Stop it. All of you stop it. Stop. Stop it all of you. Damn it! Stop it, Clara! Hannes! Stop with that. Leave it! They've gone crazy. The kids have lost it. You're naked and cold! -Tobias, the office calls! Max! -Tobias! -Stop! Hey... -Everyone please stop! Just stop! Please! I have to go to the office. Okay? Max is cold and needs clothes. -I have to go. Come on, let's go. Sorry I bugged you. Bye, see you. Sorry, huh? -Tobias, come on. Galina. Galina Ivanowna Schnurkinowa. What a pleasure. -The pleasure is all mine. Oh, Galina. -How lovely. Lovely woman, good woman, rich woman. Big heart. -Big heart. -Big heart. May I introduce you. Tobias, my good friend. Tobias. -Tobias, come. Come here, Tobias. Oh, Tobias. What a beautiful Tobias you are. Tobias is a young architect. What a lucky coincidence. Do you have a moment? -Plenty of them. You know, I have an idea. I want to build a large harbour with big ships, with big buildings. I can do that. -You can? I can. -I think... we should drink a drop to that. Great idea. -Right. We have something to celebrate! How unexpected! Meeting an architect... who will help with my plans... Tobias, I'm delighted. -To us both. -I'm happier, still. That is so good! So good! -So wonderful. We will now eat a gherkin together. -Tobias, watch out. It's the best and most intimate connection. It's like a contract. -This is our contract. Come here. -You're both mad. We need another bottle. We are now bound by a gherkin. To the gherkin. -The gherkin. That's so good. -It's so good. You know, I'll give you my business card... That's pretty special. -Because I never want us to lose touch. You must drink. Schnurkinowa. -Schnur-kin-owa... Good energy pulses into my body. I want to fly upwards with Tobias. -We can fly. Where will you fly to? -We're flying into the future. Ah, the future. I'm flying to the horizon... To me, you're a huge construction crane. You've never heard such beautiful words. -Never. A crane. -A big one. -The crane of the future. A huge crane. You're the biggest... -... crane in the world! That was lovely. Please pick me up... What... Collect me here. And we'll fly to the horizon. Collect me here... Are you awake, Papa? Max! Get the flannel! Oh, no... oh Max... Please let me sleep... -Clara, Max! Here you are. -Let Papa sleep. He worked all night. How long do you want to keep sleeping? Till I'm finished. Oh, the whole family! I don't believe it! I've been here ten minutes already. Did we say at one? -We got held up. Hey there. Well, come on. There... Let Thomas through. Mad! -It's all still here! Look at all the foliage. -Wisteria. The tree-throttlers. -Tree-throttlers? Careful. -Thomas, how do you like it? It's great. We'll put Anika's Opticians here. -The Wisteria stays. We? -We two. A restaurant theme-park. Theme-park restaurants. -Asian ones. They'll be here... Here's the station. -What the... Here's the track. -Are we fun-fair owners now? Sure... I don't know if the bridge will hold. -It will. Tobias, don't take it wrong, it's lovely with your family on this Sunday, but will you fill me in? All this? -The whole lot... All this was once an amusement park. And now... Here we go... -... now it'll be... a residential park. It's all been sold. To a Russian investor. Ms Schnurkinowa. They're very rich, they bought the whole lot, and this Schnurkinowa, she asked us... Us? -... Zach-Bakowski... we are to do it all. -No, really? It's work for ten years. Give him a hug. Come on, hey. Thomas, this is it! It's what we worked for for years! In eight years, 15,000 people will live here. Great. I need to pee... He doesn't believe it. -Have you shot the big wheel? He's pissing in there. -Let him. Max, take a shot. Tobias... I'll go over. -Tobias! Yes? Need a hand or what? Say... Is it true? -Yes. You can promise it? I have her business card... You can promise it? On your children? -Yes! You think I invented it? -To celebrate! Wait. It's in my other trousers. I'll show you. Let's get this open. It'll be our life's work. Damn and blast it. -It's what we always wanted. How mad is that! -It's great. Good... -Good, good, it's good. Now he's good-tempered again. -Have a drink. -Man! Step right up, step right up, here we are! Bubbly on arrival! -Come along. Max, have a glass. -Bakowski and Zach! We'll use all our backpages here. Messedamm, the lot. Proper holiday for a change. -We go every year! I mean before it all starts. But I want a yacht, we'll build a marina! Yes, a marina. Thomas, Thomas, a marina! That's what I thought. -Yes? -Yes! Bravo! -My angel, my angel, fly! So it's no to Potsdamer Platz, no to Hamburger Hafencity. We want lots of air. So this, approximately, is the park. Nice, but leave air between. Down here. To Galina Ivanowna Schnurkinowa! To architecture in general, and more particularly, to renovation! Gee, it's ages since we had such a good time. We did all in one night. Look, a titty. See? Spree River titty! Your car stays here? -Yes. Taxi. Taxi... -Come on, we'll take the car. No. -Come on, let's play. We have to pick up the kids. -I'll lose, anyway. There. -You see? The loser has to drive. There he is. Morning. -Enjoy your day... Clara, get in quick. Hannes, have a nice day. Pull your feet in. We'll speak at lunch. And Max needs a crap Three times already he's gone parp! Join in, kids... You an Elvis-impersonator or what? Memphis is the other way. I'll give you the finger! -Shut it, you fat pig. Should Papa race him? -Yes... Tobias, hit it! Get this, you wanker! Two can play at that. -Here! My granny used to drive one of those, wanker! The highlights are great with our new glasses, huh? Yes. -You're happy with the frames? Great. -But they slide? They're so light, it's great. -They slide. When you look down... or always? -Yes. Always when I look down, but little by little they also... Can I tell you something? -Yes. Your ears... -... are uneven, yes. For others it's the nose. -To one side. One second. Seidler Spectacles, Anika here. Yes... Hello? Yes. Accident and emergency... Thank you... Goodbye. Mrs Moritz, can you come back tomorrow? -Of course. We'll continue then. -Yes... Oh my Lord. Mrs Zach... -Yes... Your cap. Hey! -Easy. We've got to go. Here is your cap! Come on. -Bye, kids. Bye, Papa! -Bye. Stupid, so stupid! We still have to wait a moment. For what? I invited Thomas. Why did you do that? What is this nonsense? He's known you for so long. Know what this means? Shouldn't we speak alone? What? Here he is. Why does this mean? -That's obvious. It means the pressure is on. Hey... Hey, mate. All present and correct? The kids, everything fine? -Nothing happened. Well, almost nothing. It's no big deal, right? Houston, we've got a problem. Two of them, even. There is no Schnurkinowa. Course there is. -There isn't. We met her. Thomas I met... -I Googled her. Zilch. I phoned around... to local and national authorities. From now onto 2061, the land development plan for Spree Park only approves use as a leisure park or nature reserve. So? -You're going to build there? Hence our visit? -I can Google, too. Why were we there? -Well... There is no Schnurkinowa! None! -Course there is. And the Senate reacquired the land. -To what end? They'll change the development plan so Ms Schnurkinowa buys it. Tobias. -Get off. -Tobias. Schnurkinowa is one thing. But... I smell it every day. I don't know at all when the last time was that you... I mean, the kids might have died, huh? Well... It's a matter of seeing... you don't need to get pissed up at 10 am. You really don't need to, Tobias. There's your shift, you get it done, then you can open a bottle. The same goes for driving. I'd already told you. It's simple. You do it sober. I... -Really easy. I can do without drink. You don't have to be extremist about it. Doing without is extremist? -No! But partying... -Ease up. We can quit it for a month or forget it. Yes. -I could not drink for a time. No big deal. -Thirty days. Would it be ill-timed if I have a drink now? No, check the fridge. -Okay. We can throw everything out. Throw out all we have. We just throw it all out. Right? -Throw it all out. No problem. -Empty the shelf. We'll empty the whole shelf. Thanks. Cheers. Thomas can take some bottles home. We needn't throw them all away. Ms Brand is coming back tomorrow at 10. I want you to give an exquisite lecture. Facade-suspension... and thermal, okay? You've got it. Okay... Come on. I'll see you out. -It'll be fine. We'll do it. He's got to perform tomorrow or it's the end. Sure. That won't help, not at all. It was expensive, too. Hello! Hey, that's my private brewery. You're stupid, totally silly. This was your idea. Rubbish. I'll look after that. Look. -This is silly. Totally silly. How funny, ha-ha! No one's laughing. Quit it, won't you? This isn't funny. Give me that. Oh, great. As if it were free. There's another bottle you can open. Imbecilic idea. I was only joking. -Great, huh? It's all gone. Hannes, move away from there. No, I... -I don't want him lying there. Let him rest. -I'm comfortable here. No, please move. I don't feel like it. -Nor do I. I was just... -No need to pollute the atmosphere. So, off we go. Get lost. Forgive... Forgive... Forgive me... I can't carry on. Stay by me. It's thanks to me That you had a first kiss Thanks to me That you're the man you is Thanks to me That you got your degree Thanks to me That you have wife and kiddies We've seen so much together Don't you think that without me Something would be missing? Without me You are half as interesting Without me You are half as elegant Without me You are just an elephant Without me You are completely uptight You speak as if Tween us nothing were right Why so? I only want to help you Whenever you needed me I was here for you Now you say I'm intrusive today, tomorrow and forever What nonsense! You're muddled up You know yourself We belong together I'll stay home today. At long last. At long last. Wait... Wait up... -Yes. Down we go. Tobias... if you love me half as much as I do you... then we can do this. We'll do it. I want to do it. Shut it! Come on, piggyback. Wait, my skirt needs lifting. Now my shoe... -Attention. Off we go. Arriba! Perhaps you'll be seated here. Thanks. Do you know what you'll drink? -I'd like a glass of dry white wine. I recommend the Pinot Grigio. Balanced, fruity... Fruity sounds good. My head won't be heavy tomorrow? -You'll be fine if you stick to two-three glasses. Then I'll have it. -And you? Water. -Water? Loud or quiet? Still or fizzy? Fizzy. -Fizzy. No, I have a white wine spritzer. Okay? -Go ahead and drink. It's fine. No, I'll have the spritzer. One spritzer... -With the Pinot, right. Thanks. Are you very hungry? -Loud or quiet! He didn't get it at once. They have starters and main courses. It so much to read. I can't make up my mind. Will you take a starter? Do you know them? Do you know them from work? -No. So a spritzer for the attractive young lady. Thanks. -And a loud, fizzy water... for the gentleman who today, exceptionally, isn't drinking anything. Don't drink it all at once. Clinking glasses is silly, huh? Right? Cheers. It's all right, huh? Tasty. Tobias, are you all right? -Huh? Will you give me your hand? So here I am again. I have to inform you the salmon and tuna are still in the... water! They're still swimming out there. So the chef said that today and for free, there's a sweet drop of this on the house. I don't want any. Stop it! Go away. Jeez! Stop it. -Tobias! The wine was really bitter. Outrageous! -Fruity indeed! It's completely uptight here, anyway. What a place! Pure crap! Five, two, seven. Eight. Five. Six. Two. No. Yes. Yes. Come on. Caught fast. -Nine. Tobias! Good you're back. I was waiting. -Hannes! Hannes, wake up. -Let's go. I think we need an ambulance. -He's just had a drink. Come along. -Hannes! Wake up! Wake up, Hannes! Hannes, please wake up. Tobias, please call the paramedics. Hannes! Tobias, do something. -Tobias, we're going. Tobias, I want you to come along. Tobias! Anika, I have to go. No, no! You're staying here. Come on, Tobias, we're leaving. -You're not going. Tobias, defend yourself. Defend yourself. Hello... Can you hear me? Hello. Look in my eyes. You've had a skinful. Can you hear me? -Yes. Can you tell me your name? What is it? Tobias. Tobias. Tobias. You have a surname? Tobias Zach. Zach. -Mr Zach... Tobias Zach. Where am I? I was about to ask you that myself. No idea. -No idea. How did I get here? -What is your last recollection? My wife. Yes, you're tied up. Don't worry. Don't panic. You're in hospital, Mr Zach. Hospital. -Hospital.. Has this happened before? You having drunk one over the eight? -No, never. Never? It's time this stops. If I examine your values, and the state... of your liver, the varicose veins in your throat from which you will bleed to death, the serious pancreatic inflammation, your chronically weakened heart, I see you've long been a drinker. I'm back... -It's time you do something about it. You're seriously ill. You're an alcoholic. And you will only continue living if you do something about it. If you don't do so, there's nothing any of us can do. I brought you new glasses. Look that way. Are yours also new? They are my old ones. Look downwards. All right. These are just a few things. The rest is in Thomas' shed. He'll call you about the key. You can stay there for the time being. How are the children? Hannes? He's better now. But it's nice here. Architecture's golden hour. Grubby like a junkie's bum. You're on your ass. We can hang that up. You drive drunk and hit Anika in the gob. Thomas screwed Anika. Max is certainly not yours. If I spend Christmas here I'll puke. There's not even any heating. This shit sticks like snot. Of course he screwed Anika. Every which way he could. Why the hell did you hit Anika? That's why we got kicked out. You were to look after Hannes, but instead you ran after me. Because you're weak. No resolve. You turn your life to shit. You done did it. That's my Tobias. That's my Tobias! Vodka. TODAY CHEAP VODKA If I survive this, I'll stop. Don't fall asleep, Tobias. You're a good person. You're a good person. It's almost done. Come on. It's almost done. Up there. Behind the bridge. If it goes pear-shaped, you're for it, mate. Holy shit. It's Hannes. I'm the emptiest bottle of all. Should I get the alcohol quick and then we go? Chill out. -I can do it in an instant. Chill. We're a team. But we must not be caught. -It'll be fine. Okay, we're on. Boy, does it stink! -What the hell! Let's get the alcohol and split. -Yuck! Let's say cheers first. Don't wake him. -Chill out, huh? Don't touch. You scared or what? Let's go. If he wakes up... Come on. -Don't touch, you spazz! You'll be wanting to share. What? -What do you mean, what? Are you screwing us about or what? We're in your father's allotment. -No. -No? No. -What a spazz you are. What's with you? Well? He's not your dad? You shut up. He's not your dad? You don't mind if I piss on him? Yes? -Let me be. Hold him tight. Feel free to watch. You're so... Mr Zach, the post-boxes are crucial. Check them daily for lab dates, etc. The post-box number is your room number. Always keep right of the coloured statue and you'll find corpus two. An easy landmark. What an architectural highlight! Anyway, here's the atrium... Tomorrow is your big day. Endless tests. Blood is upstairs here. Urine is where you're staying. ECG is later. -There's the sea! The lagoon. The lagoon. -There's swimming there till 8 pm. At eight it's out. And there's a volleyball team of similar addicts. No way... -Here's the day room. There's the easy corner, games, puzzles, the whole bit. This key opens your door. Your room is number 172. Stroke it till it turns green. Then it opens. Right... -Here's the cupboard and the toilet. Very nice. -You have any questions? Can I vape here? No. Smoking is outside. You can smoke at the jetty or on the yard. But not inside. Well... -Fine. -Fine. Don't forget the urine specimen. Right. Shitty air here. Hello. It's midweek. You've all had a look around. Today there's a change to the plan. There are introductions to be made, Let me introduce myself... Elke. -Everyone knows me already. That says it all. Now you're all invited... to introduce yourselves so we're familiar, so we can... get to it at once. Tobias, this way. I'm Jörn Sommer. I'm a qualified psychotherapist. But let's not dwell on that. So now you have... the opportunity... to introduce yourself. We'd like to know your name, how long you've been here, which is the relevant addiction... I am Miss Annelie Knopf. I'm 92 years old. I take one single pill at night. That's it. -At 92? Call that addiction? -I... My name is Siegfried Herzog. Known as Siggi. I'm a policeman and an alcoholic. And I had... When I was here for ten days I had my first relapse. Well, my name is... Jan-Ole von Tronka. I'm here because I of my hyper-sexuality, To me it's a problem that I suffer from an addiction which isn't taken seriously. Sorry. -Well I'm... Jimmy, well Hans-Jimmy. I'm 38 and have been here three weeks. Gambling addiction. Yes... hello. I'm a little excited. I'm new to this. I'm... Tobias Zach, a professional civil engineer... and architect with a joint partnership... Bakowski and Zach... I'm married and have three children. And... I'd like... to stop drinking. That's why I'm here. Are you ready? -Yes. Are you ready? -Yes. Then come on! You say your name and link your name to a gesture. Jörn. -Jimmy. Tobias. -Siggi. -Great... Jimmy. Jörn... Siggi. Jan-Ole. Tobias... Annelie. Elke. Siggi. We're here. Super. Mr Zach, get a move on, you're late. From this day on, be two minutes early rather than five minutes late... Okay? Try to climb over this. Left leg first. -Wait... Don't injure yourself. After these 16 weeks, alcohol will be irrelevant for you. We'll bring your weight down... put you in shape, it'll strengthen your will. No, I don't want this. -No, I don't want this. And I don't want this. -Stop it! What the... -Our theme is outwitting weakness. This isn't easy at all. It was easier to write it down. Standing here now... I see this, honesty, and think... so honest... I have stamina. Every kind of it. Bonding-ability, yes... then comes generosity... openness, there is clarity, too... and then it says, "dancing bear". I trust you. I'm betting on you, and I'll be personally disappointed if it doesn't work out, get me? If you could only see what I see. She's so beautiful. Which she? -She's so beau-ti-ful. She's a she, is she? Course. You have a guy or what? -Yes. Obviously. What? What kind of guy? A chubby little guy. With a beard... And you two are an item? -Sure we are. Come on! -For real. Give over. -We're at it the whole time. Oh stop! -She won't let me be. No way! -She lets me do it all and she loves it. Really? -Yes! Mad! -We utterly love each other. I don't know how this stupid therapie's going to end. Tomorrow he'll be dry 50 days. And why? Why? Because he's here. -Are you stupid? You can't accept this. -This is a no alcohol zone. He abides by it. -"A no alcohol zone." Who cares about that? -No, but somehow he is completely... down on me right now. So when you go to bed with your wife, he is always with you? -Always. With all your family. -He's always there. He watches when I have a crap. Mate! She doesn't get to do that with me. She cooperates? -Yes. He won't do a single thing I say. -I really break his balls. I ruin everything Just everything. -Super. I think that's good of you. You have to ruin more. The children, too. But a woman can be tiresome, too, right? -Not her. Come off it. -Not at all. But she wants to get out of here. But they all do, right? Today we're doing a solution-oriented inventory: You said that interests you, Tobias. Most of you know it. It's a fine activating exercise, and it's nice to pat one's own shoulder. Followed the motion through, Tobias. We can use powerful posture to create a retrograde feeling of strength within us. I feel strong. I will succeed. I feel strong. I will succeed. I feel strong. I will succeed. If I assume a posture like this, a sense of weakness is created and you can hardly say, I feel strong. And straighten up. -Yes, you might feel silly. So what? This is your position, now you can use your intuition to find someone for your family. Now we will introduce addiction to the mix. Here... -Work at these large muscle groups. Maintain abdominal tension. Let your voice play. I feel he's very distant because I'm certainly not his go-to guy. That would be Siggi. Then tell him that. I don't feel that you see me. -Your addiction means more to you. Your addiction means more to you. Siggi, don't take it wrong, but you're really in the way. Do what you have to do. Move him. -You have to go. Move him. -Go far away. I can feel it. -What do you feel? Addiction wants in but I don't want to give it the space. Say, I don't want you to be here. -I don't want you to be here. I must be here. You get out of my life. I can't take it. -I can't. I'll whack you. -I'm part of your life. I'll whack you. Get out of my life. -I'm part of your life... I'm out of here. He's not giving it a proper go. He's already had two relapses, and while this guy is really going for it, this jerk is trying to spoil it! I'm gone! I'm acting out an addiction! Some parties might have some difficulties but this is a way in. We'll continue in this direction so as to develop and mobilise force so as to... become independent, so we can say, I am me, you're you... leave me be. -I am valuable. I don't want this. This is shit. It's dead as a graveyard. Pack your things, I'll take you home. Well? -I'm doing therapy. What do you mean, therapy? Therapy... -That's some fashionable nonsense. Like burnout. Imagine if my farmer-grandfather had a burnout and said at 5 am, Fuck your cows, I'm suffering from burnout! I don't need a cynic, I need a friend. Maybe you'd better go. Is that your therapist talking? You've worked on yourself? -I'm doing so. Did you go deep into your synapses and find new knowledge? Now we're gawking at some stupid swan. What a great life. Get lost. -I will. I meant him. You know, sometimes you've got to go. Enjoy your cuppa now. All gone. Max, Clara. Papa! Hello! My sweeties... On you go... Hannes... Hey. -Hey. How's Hannes? Bad tempered. I noticed. It's a permanent condition right now. We have to get in, right? Hannes... keep an eye, okay? Clara, Max, I'll be right back. You're coming. Hey, you're coming. I said you're coming. -Are you nuts? I told you to leave Hannes in peace. Move it. Now! So, we're now in a place where I... want to ask you, Mrs Zach, if you can forgive your husband... How long does this shit go on? -Yes. Can you tell him that? What? -Formulated as a sentence. It's important to express things. This has a power of its own. I forgive you. How does that feel? It's really beneficial. -Uh-huh. Could you say thank you? Thanks. Do you want to go back home? Yes. -Tobias, you can forget it! Then say so. This is really getting me down, I'll go see what Hannes is up to. Tobias! Stay focused. -Tobias! Tobias... will you formulate that to your wife? -What? Do you want to go back to your family? Yes. -How about you? Do you want it, too? Nope... That is... How's that, nope? Do I have to formulate again? If you would. -No. I don't want that. Good. Great. It's marvellous you're so honest. That's really important right now. What about Hannes? -Tobias... Did you hear what your wife just said? They're alone at the lake. I'm heading over. Or was that not a sentence? -It's fine... You're leaving? -Yes. -Thanks. How do you feel now? Shitty. You'll make it. I've got to go, too. Are you coming along? Where to? To the bar with Siggi. -You what? You're crazy. I'm not going to a bar. -So stay and smoke here. Come on... Come on. -I... Quiet. Watch it! You really think he's coming? Yes. What? -Huh? Nothing. Who do we have here? -Siggi, are you nuts? Cheers, cheerio. You can't get boozed up here. My word, no one will know. Quit moralising. -No one will know. No one will know. -But you're boozing it up. We're at the addiction clinic. Not here. Tobias, please go back. -Shut it, please. You can have a beer. No one will know. You won't be drunk. Tomorrow it'll be gone. I can't. -Try harder. -Come off it. Go home. -Hey, Siggi. -Tobias, come in my house... and have a little beer. They'll kick us out... -Come on. -Tobias, go back to the clinic. My word... Cheers. -One beer, Tobias. -One beer. One beer. -You've been dry 50 days. What's a beer? One beer. -I really don't know... Siggi... Siggi, one beer. -One beer and we go. Yes... Promise? -Promise. -One beer? Promise. Cross my heart and hope to die. Well, then. But only one... -Only one... One-two... -One-two... Not two... Only the... -Two... We're only having the one... Give us one... He only wants one. Only one... Only one. -Thank you! Today is really the last time. -The last. No. I don't want that! The one before last. -Wait up, Siggi. No, I don't want this. Two more beers, please. -I'm so... valuable. Long life, vacation all right! Yes indeedy. Down in one. But only one. Only one more. -Only one. -Only one. We really messed up today. Tobias, we're in the shit. -You did very well. Come on. -Check it! Shit! Well? What happened? We had an alcohol-accident. An alcohol-accident... said the pitiful mole... Well, what does the lapdog say? Nothing. Who started it? That's not true. It was me. And you just went along, right? With a weakling like that? A spineless guy who thinks he's the greatest... Who let it all hang out, really went to town, went and painted it red... great. Go and pack. And leave. At once. I'm throwing you out. Get lost. Can't you... -Pipe down. Or you're out, too. You know... -There's no second chance, okay. I hope you get it. Thanks. So what do we say? Take care. Don't fuck up. Can you do me a favour? Don't be as dumb as me. So it's leave-taking time. -Yes. Thanks. -Any time. Come on. -How about a kiss? Not never, no! Ciao. Siggi! I was a kid You took me by the hand, you did Consoled me, together we swam You'd told me I was an invincible man A clever fella, a brave one, a fighter That... I should never stop When it gets exciting You love me But your love is devastating And the bar is closed... There's nothing more for sale But you... You have me drink up In this tearful vale Maybe it's best for us both To drown in the foam But I can't stand up You're a screw I can't undo I can't go Have no strength to say no Or meet the glance Of those I love I drink... But my lips twist... There's a line... And you've crossed it twelve times... There's no, I'm sorry, ever so... There's no, Let's talk it through... Neither of us will survive this night. You pig! You pig, you pig, you pig... You pig... My dears... Today we take leave of Tobias. I think you've used your time here in the clinic to build up a stable foundation which will see you right in the future. Good luck. -Tobias, I'm proud of you. Thank you. The two wolves. One evening at the campfire, an old Cherokee Indian told his grandson of the battle played out in everyone: he said... My son, The battle is done by two wolves that dwell within each of us. One is evil. -He is wrath... -Envy... Jealousy. -Care... Pain. -Greed. -Arrogance. Self-pity. -Guilt. -Prejudice. Poor self-esteem. -Falsehood. False pride. -And the ego. The other is good. -It is joy. Peace. -Love. Hope. -Merriness. Humility. -Kindness. -Goodwill. Affection. -Generosity. Sincerity. -Sympathy. And faith. The grandson thought a while about the words of his grandfather and then asked: Which of the wolves wins? The old Cherokee replied: The one you feed. You can do it. Take care. Thanks. Come here. Tobias likes DeBottle DeBottle likes Tobias... I'm fond of you We're in the same class And if the both of us walk one kilometre Tobias says at once I'm so glad to see ya But one turned to ten Ten turned to twenty Twenty turned to eighty And then to hundred-twenty After 7000 kilometres Tobias stood still as a rake His entrails began to quake DeBottle I'm sorry but I need a break You carry on I've had all I can take DeBottle just laughed, You don't just get to roam Our friendship is our ancestral home It's unending, unbreakable, indissoluble, forever You can't leave me I'm your ego's alter I acquired you And you belong to me... Good luck, mate... BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS THOMAS COOPER
