Is it the same room where Hershell died? I don't know, Francis. Same raggedy drapes. This crummy wallpaper. They all look the same. All I remember... It was a Friday the last time I saw Hershell. You still playing those weird chords? Yeah, still at it, Lady Hersh. How's you feeling? You drive people wild. They can't follow the tune. Yeah, I know. Then you be out of business. You ought to listen to me more. Folks like the way I play. Well, yeah. They do. I'm going to Paris, Hersh... Tonight. What's that gonna fix? You remember Paris. It won't change the way you play. No cold eyes in Paris. Can't you talk the way other folks talk neither? You know Who's gonna be waiting for you in Paris, don't you? You. If you had seen Hershell and Dale play together, Francis... It's something that you could never forget. It was so new and so different, and yet so close. Maybe it was all those memories... That made Dale leave for Paris that Friday morning. Maybe what he saw in Hershell's eyes... Was too frightening and too familiar. Come on, baby, be careful over there. Try to hold on. My goodness gracious. You're almost up here. Come on. it's only one up. Needs a little something, Lady Ace. It needs okra. You can burn, but you don't always eat. And you know Dale loves Paris. Be the greatest city in the world if I could just find some okra. What do you know about Paris, Ace? You do nothing but stay in that damn room in your robe... And slippers, cooking all day. At least I'm doing it in Paris. I got something for you. So what's new, Lady Ace? This is better than living in Harlem. Hello, Butter. What are you doing in Paris? You feeling real good, ain't you? Fine as wine. You better get yourself some rest, because you got to play tonight. Dale? Mesdames et Messieurs, we're gonna celebrate... The Maitre du Saxo Tenor... A man who has influenced musicians throughout the world... And a man who has definitely influenced us on the bandstand. A little ice, a little ice in the berg. ...Mr. Dale Turner. They're doing great. What the hell is this? - What do you think it is? I lost a button. Really? - Yeah. Get it fixed. I don't sew. - I don't either. You're telling me. Come on, Charlie. Wake up. He's really great. He could at least stand when he plays. Or he could be on his back, he'd still be great. Yeah? Just like you? Not on my back, I gotta be on my front to be great. Yeah. I must be invisible in here. Look, we gotta cut. We have another set to do. Yeah. You half a motherfucker... Can I have another Vin Rouge? Well, this establishment has never really been known for it's... Conviviality. Hey, Ben. Forget it, Dale. Madame Queen, how are we doing? - Hello. Clap hands, here comes Butter. Here it is. I took out the two packages of Pall Malls... And one extra Coca-Cola Dale had. Can ya spare 5 francs? Shut up. Don't be an asshole. What's 5 francs? I'm stuck. I've gotta buy a train ticket. Came on, it's not much. Scrum. If had any cash I'd be inside. Come on, I gotta get you in this taxi and get you home. See you tomorrow night. All right. You all right, babe? - Yeah. What is it? I was scared. Of what? Don't do that. Where were you? I went for cigarettes. He played like a god, that Dale Turner. You're open all night, Ace? I need the advice of an expert, a real expert. I want you to try this. Where'd you get jambalaya herbs in Paris? I travel with it all the time. Man, you crazy? Gotta have it. You're slick. - You betcha. So, Lady Ace, where are you working now? I got three Weeks across the river. How long are you gonna be at the Blue Note? Well, as long as they'll have me. Listen, I'll fall by sometime if it's okay with you. All right? Here. Enjoy that. Hey, Ace. - Buttercup. You know what I need? I need a new reed. A Rico number three. Well, can't you blow through what everybody else do? No. Even Bean uses a reed... - Listen, I ain't Bean... Or anybody else. I'll get it because you been good. Was good tonight. That's what they tell me. - Just like before. Well, it's almost light. I guess I'll go for a promenade. The Mad Scientist. The answer is no. Ben, just one Vin Rouge. - Buttercup says no. Buttercup is really not my mother. Come on, man. Makes you sick, Dale. - Not good wine. Just don't serve me that stuff you serve your customers. Great. - Thank you. Hey, man, can you buy me a beer? - Yeah. Yes. A beer and a coffee. You know, I know you. I mean, your music, your composition, every recording. This guy's a fabulous tenor. The best. That's true. Yes, that's true. You, Bird, Bud Powell, Lester Young... You have revolutionized music. You know, last time you played in Paris... I'm in the army and going to Algeria the next morning. But I want to hear you play so much, I jumped over the wall. And I got 10 days of jail for that. Do you have enough dough for another beer? Yes. This is my friend. He's with me. What do you know? Hi. - My friend, Francis. Yeah, how you doing, man? - Good. Who is that? Well, he's an old jail buddy of mine. Hey, Wes. - How are you? All right. How you doing there? - Fine. Pretty slow over there though. Yeah, but it's not slow over here. Not for us. How you doing? Say, Eddie. How long you been living here, man? - Quite some time. Matter of fact, I'm married now to French Chiquita here. How you doing? Can you speak the local bebop? Trying it, don't have it together yet. But she's beginning to speak American. But I bet the lady can burn. - Did you see this? She's a great cook. You know the Dale has been married three or four times? And we all spoke fluent English. But nobody could burn. Say, Lady Ben... How about a nice soft one for the Dale? Nothing doing. There's not enough kindness in the world. You know, I haven't been doing anything hard. Not even a bonbon. Never. The deal is no, Dale. No for anything. But the deal with who? They always paying all the wrong people in this world. S'il vous plait, I would like to have the same thing he had. Hey, man. You want to come upstairs? What do you want him to do? Read you a damn bedtime story? Come on. I have a kid. She sometimes wakes up in the night. Yeah, I remember it rained pitifully that day. We were an all-Negro unit... With all-pink officers. One day at inspection... This captain found a photo of my wife, who was... Lighter-skinned and much prettier than his. So then he made one of those funny remarks and I hit him in the head... Which really wasn't the way white folks were treated in those days. So then I found myself in the Camp Polk stockade... Where they started to do drum paradiddles on my head... For sometime. Yeah, I got lucky. I found this Jewish doctor from New York. Without him, it would've been a catastrophe. He got me out of the army. You know, it just occurred to me... That bebop was invented by the cats... Who did get out of the army. It meant a whole week's work. You said you wanted a drawing, and now it's photos. Next time tell me what you want. I'll do it faster than anyone else. Did it work? Sure. Fantastic. You could take your daughter sometimes. Even a common whore... Even a common whore... Looks after her kids. Who wants more? Eddie? I got plenty more in the kitchen. - You want some? I ain't missing this. - It's good. I know. I smelled it a mile away. - Yeah. You got any butter? I'm gonna eat with my hands. Hey, Eddie. What you got over here? Hey, what's them little red things? What's all this? What y'all serving up? Close the door. This isn't the Casbah. What you got over here? I'm getting my own food... Put some of those red things in there. That's fabulous. Put a little more in there, darling. You know I could smell this a mile away? What's keeping you from coming in? This November I could not see my grandmother. I bet that. You think so? - I think so. You bringing bad news, Francis? Hershell died last night. Hershell? Lady Hersh? This is not Lady Hersh. - Let me see that. That's Hershell. That's the way he looked the last time I saw him in New York City. You are tired, Dale? Yes, I'm tired... Of everything except the music. I can't get it right. I've forgotten the words. Do you like basketball? A rum and coke for Mr. Turner for being superb. Next one you pay for. Charlie, take a break, man. How's your schedule for next month? - Next month? I don't even know about tonight. - You give me a call. Hey, Dale. I saw you in Chicago. I think you were with Dizzy and Bud. Think we even had a drink afterwards. Yeah, I think I remember now, man. Listen, you got $5? Hey, Ben, can you call me a taxi? I thought the duke went out to get you one. That Prussian faggot was gonna rule the world... But he can't find a damn taxi Worth a shit. Where's Dale? You seen him? He was right here, five minutes ago. - Shit. Where are you taking him? To the hospital. No. Let him go. You a relative? Want to join him? Let go, damn it. What's going on? This is my friend... A great jazz musician, a genius, damn it. You're not right, shit. Fine, you're Dale Turner. You play too good for this shit. He won't throw up? I'll get his key. I got him. My goodness. What in the world am I gonna do with you? Just like a baby. Got to watch you every single minute. I invite you for dinner tomorrow night, 8:00. You're a real Tarzan, ain't you, boy? Are you his wife? - Are you a fool? Okay, please tell him... Here is my phone number and my address. Tomorrow night, 8:00. Hey, Buttercup, you want some rice and beans? Did something happen tonight? To get him like that? - Yeah. When you have to explore every night... Even the most beautiful things that you find can be the most painful. You understand what I'm saying? All these young kids sound the same. Just like they had the same teacher. It was you. - Yeah, me... And a few others. You act like my little girl. The dishes, Berangere. You know, one night in Brooklyn this tenor player comes in... And he sits down, and he listens. And then he comes up to me and says: 'l play you better than you.' You know, your music changed my life. I would never have read Rimbaud or any other poets. Because of your music... I've discovered a lot of musicians... - Francis... Is there water in this wine? Yeah. What'd he say? Later. It doesn't look good, but it is. Who are your favorite tenors? Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins... And Ben Webster. I also used to listen to a lot of Debussy. Debussy? Berangere. That's a big name for a little girl. Tell me. Does Louis XIV still live here? Oh, no. He died for... Along time ago. Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm sure. Berangere waits for me. But it's along time before it's light again, man. Is the circus almost over? Well, Lady Sweets. Are we ready for tonight? You half a motherfucker. Two red Win es please. He's there. Dale, it's me. Never leave Dale in a hospital, Francis. Then cut it out... It's up to you. Cut it out. You didn't wake me for school. You stay home and watch Dale, okay? He's living here now. Have a croissant. We're gonna get another apartment. What's going on? Want another one? Is it Berangere? Don't get excited. I just need money. I'll pay you back. What's the waiter up to? Two new contracts. They love my stuff. In debt? No. Yes. I want to move. I found a place. But they want 800,000 for key money. Dale Turner's living with us. Yes. Dale Turner's living with us. You understand-We need more room. I want him to compose again. He's terrific. Just fantastic. If I'm anything today. It's on account of guys like him. I'm working twice as hard: I'll do anything for him. Nobody inspires me like him. I want the greatest sax player... To live decently. For us three, the apartment was always fine. It didn't bother you then. In any case, you left. Let's not start that again. I'm asking you as a friend. I'll pay you back in 6 months. Two coffees. No, a cake. Coke and a coffee. And I never inspired you? Will you lend it, yes or no? No.. You can but you won T, right? That's right. Don't you miss your kid? You'd have been lost without her. And you Ere too wrapped up with your guy. Yeah, happiness is a nice, wet... Rico reed. Your dad here? No.. You Berangere? For your dad from your mom. Do you like basketball? Basketball? Checking out without saying goodbye? Butter, I want my passport. I got it hidden in the room. Make sure you keep it in a safe place. Francis, you make sure he get to the gig on time. Hey, Mama. Want some of these ribs and rice I got in my room? Sorry, Papa. I only eat kosher food. Have some. Listen to that, Francis. The swing bands used to be all... Straight tonics, seventh chords. Ana' then, with the Basie band... I heard Lester Young... And he sounded like he came out of the blue. Because he was playing all the color tones... The sixths and the ninths... And major sevenths. You know, like Debussy and Ravel. Then Charlie Parker came on... And he began to expand and... He went into elevenths and thirteenths... And flat fives. Luckily, I was going... In the same direction already. You just don't go out... And pick a style off a tree one day. The tree is inside you growing naturally. I looked away for just a minute and he was gone. Tell him it's the last time. You ain't doing no better than me, boy. Sure there's no Dale Turner here? I said no. Big guy, black. Maybe he didn't have his papers. Check with admissions. I was just there, thanks. They didn't tell you there's a Black American... He's in the pavilion there. Where? Thanks. Let go of me. (Hands off) for Christ sake. Let him go. Calm down. I want to see Dale Turner. He's here; I just examined him. He'll die here-in the last hospital they hosed him down with ice water. I know-just calm down. We talked it over. What will you do? You are tired, Dale? Yes. I'm tired of everything... Except music. I wish I could rest. You don't sleep? Yes, I sleep... But there's always the dreams. What kind of dreams? Well, it's always about music... And playing the saxophone. The sound... And expanding the music. You know, more and more. You know, there's been nights... When I've been working and playing... And at the end of the night... I look at my mouthpiece... And it's all bloody. But I haven't felt a thing, you know. My life is music. My love is music. And it's 24 hours a day. Do you understand? Yeah. Do you have sexual relations? Oh, yes. Whenever I can. Lady Francis. Merci, Doctor. Taxi. Dale? - Yes? When you were talking to the doctor, I was listening. You were? - Yeah. Was I good? Bonjour, Lady Francis. But never... Never again, man. Don't cry for me. Never again, Francis. - What else can I do... when you are killing yourself? - I'll stop. Stop? - I promise. How? You never stopped before. I never promised anybody before. Francis... You think we can find a trumpet player for tonight? Yeah. So, Eddie... I think... You have two bars... Vamp to bring us in, right? Night. And then we come right in... On the melody. Okay. One, two, three, two, two... Try it again with eight, right? Okay. One, two, three, two, two, three... Hey. - This your little girl? Merci. This wan't do at all. Too much war, kids and Japs. No go. Okay then, what do we show? It's an anti-Japanese war film. With kids. First, I don't see Jeff Chandler... We were just discussing the poster. Yes. Sterling is thrilled... Thinks it's even better than the American one... We'll use it for all the European markets. Terrific, isn't it? The best. You're great, my friend. Do you like Monet? Oh, yes. All the colors... He sounds like Ravel or Tadd Dameron. It's like bebop. Who is that playing? Who is playing? it's you. You just made the record. Not bad. Well... It's a nice day out. I think I'll go for a little stroll. Could you... Loan me a few francs? I want to go to the tabac: And get some cigarettes. Merci. Monsieur? A n orange juice, plea s e. Ana' some Pall Malls. What the hell is all this about? It's about Dale, and how, from tonight on, he gets paid direct. Bullshit. Direct. Every night, like everybody else been. That ain't my deal with Goodley, Dale. You want to show me the paper? You mean a contract? Yeah, where it says... She gets paid every night. Shit, man, you ain't been straight enough to sign your own damn name... On nobody's contract. Butter... I've been straight enough to play my axe... Every night, and... sweetly. If I don't get my dough tonight... I won't be back tomorrow. I gotta talk to Madame Queen. Do that. You pay him, you'll be in a world of trouble. Hey... Was I good? Direct. Like everybody else. Tomorrow... A new wallet. A big one. Beef steak. 'Boff' steak. No, beefsteak. Enjoy. You're a great cook, Dale. Really, it's marvelous. - Merci. You're a king. Like Louis the XIV? - Exactly. I don't know about that... But you always treat me like one, Francis. What did he say? We treat him like e king. Pots to? On top or on the side? This meat is huge. Francis. Oh, shit. Why? Hello, Long Tall. I dreamed you were coming to Paris. Tonight We have in the house with us Miss Darcey Leigh. Perhaps if we welcome her nicely to the stage, she'll join us. Please? How Long Has This Been Going On? You know your cue? - Yes, the two. Put on a hell of a show. Yeah, and we cut a few sides, too. I heard. I heard you're playing soprano again, too. Yeah, first time in along time. Why do you seem so on edge? Just because... I keep wondering if I still have something to give. Of course you do. You have a lot to give. It was you who taught me to listen to the bass instead of the drums. Well, you would've learned that in 10 or 15 years anyway. I always thought we would keep each other company. We have. Dale, do you have any regrets? Only one. Which is? I had big eyes... To play with Count Basie's band. But he told me that... One band leader in the band was enough. Maybe it was for the better, huh? Oh, no. Dale's cool. Well, look at this. Miss Buttercup. How you doing? Hey, Big D. How you doing, man? Let me tell you something. How are you? - Fine, how are you? Man, it's good to see you. Number One stole the cookie from the cookie jar. Who, me? - Yeah, you. Couldn't be. - Then who? Number Two had his finger in the cookie jar. Who, me? - Yeah, you. Couldn't be. - Then who? Number Three stole the cookies from the cookie jar. Who him? - Look at his face. That's him. Number Three is in the cookie jar. The leg, the classic leg. Oh, no, honey. Thank you. She got you. This is why my tie's flying around my neck all day. Right? Exactly. Sing this song. Yeah. Here we go. You're all right. Bravo. Bravo. It's funny how the world is inside of nothing. I mean, you have your heart and your soul... Inside of you. Babies are inside of their mothers. Fish are out there in the water. But the world... Is inside nothing. I don't know if I like this or not... But you better write it down. Daddy, look what I found. It's for you. There's a call for you. You're kidding. Hello? Long distance? Yeah. Yeah. No, I can't come, I'm having too much fun. That was Birdland. - Yeah? They wanted me to come back. Did he tell you the one about The Red Shoes? The Had Shoes, I saw it 40 times... But there's one scene I like... Where the impresario is eating his breakfast, a three-minute egg. A young composer is really disturbed because he wants to see Mr. Lementoff... To complain about a piece of music that was stolen. So he walks into his room. He says, 'I'd like to complain about a piece of music I wrote... 'which was stolen by my professor.' Mr. Lementoff didn't respond. So David Krasner, that's his name, said, 'Sorry I spoiled your breakfast.' Mr. Lementoff said, 'Mr. Krasner, come here and sit down. 'Sometimes it is much more disheartening to steal than to be stolen from. Good day.' Wes, we gotta get cracking here. Then you go your C again. It's the quarter note. Quarter note to a... Down to your F. Okay, you got the beginning intro. And Palle... You're next. One, two, three... Didn't see you. Coffee? Sure. There's no hurry. I said in 6' months... The rest is coming. He still inspires you? Not only that-You're gonna hear something fantastic... I'd like to have Berangere, a bit. I'm organized now, so if she wants... Sure she would. What happened? Fell out of love? Want to come back? Come on-they're recording. Hear that? What are you doing? Dropped my bag. Your tie, dad. Ready? I hope your family likes surprises. Hello, grandma... But we expected you later. We took an early train. I'm not ready... Come in, sir. How you've grown. Mom, Dale Turner, a great musician. He speaks French well. Hello, grandad. My husband. Your son, Francis.. Really? He thinks I'm terrific. You lost weight. You like the quennelles? Do you like the quennelles, Monsieur Turner? Very good. We take the napkins, too? No angel. Can you bring the plates? You stay here. Close the shutters. There '5 cake? Why a cake? Can I help? Why the shutters if there's no cake? Because your grandma asked. First make a wish. That's it. What was it? If I say, it won't came true. You cut and be careful. Light it, it's for Dale. Make a wish, Dale. She wants you to make a Wish. A wish? - Yeah. Blow it out. The candle. - Yeah. Blow. Keep if. Say, you lose weight. They're nice people, your family. They don't really like jazz. Well... That's all right. But I felt... That they like to live in harmony. Did I ever tell you about the Alvin Hotel? A lot of great musicians... Live there. Yeah, Lady Francis... I think it's about time for me to go home. I hope some good friends are here to meet us. Welcome home, Dale. R.W. Goodley. You must be Francis. You took good care of Dale. He looks great. I haven't seen him look this good in years. How's Buttercup? What's she up to? She's trying to run a red beans and rice joint in Paris. She's great, I tell you. A great cook. Wow. I don't remember all these people being here when we left. Oh, they were here. It's your first time in New York? - Yeah. You're in for a real treat. When you get back to Paris, you'll rave about how nice New Yorkers are. When would that be? - Pardon? How long are you going to be with us? I don't know. Not long. Not long? I've been to Paris. I mean, I took Paris, you know. But I let de Gaulle walk down the Champs Elys?es first. After all, it is his place. To me, Paris is a beautiful place. It's got fancy bridges and it looks... I understand they're steam cleaning the buildings now. Making them nice and white and clean. But I prefer New York. New York, for me, the music is better. Because it's tougher. There's tougher things going on here. That's because there's tougher people here. It's not for everybody, New York. We did okay with the traffic... Now we get over the Williamsburg Bridge, we'll be fine. Traffic today at rush hour was bad at the airport. The worst traffic I ever saw was in that... What's that arch in Paris? The Arch of Triumph. The car's going in a circle, right? To me, from faraway, it looks pretty. But when you're inside one of the cars, it was murder. Nobody could make the left lane. It was like bumper cars. In Coney island we have a little ride where everybody bumps into each other. I never saw drivers like these. They're crazy. Francis, let's go, come on. You can look at New York tomorrow. All right, this is it. it's your favorite place. I managed to work out an adjoining room for you... So you two are connected. I got instant coffee for you, Dale. I got peanut butter, I know you like that. I got some things to go over with you here. Your 802, your union dues. I paid your union dues, I took care of your legal fees and your fines. Whatever comes to you, you don't have to worry about it. At the end of the week, we'll discuss everything at my office. Other thing is, I'll give you a little advance, okay? Who wants it? Francis, here we are. Okay, get yourself situated. I know you probably want to go uptown, but if you want... There's the Armenian joint on 8th Avenue if you want to eat. You could also eat at the club, but if you want to go there... Or maybe the Market Diner... But the Armenian joint, you sign for it, I put it on your tab. The same thing goes for the Star Cleaners and Laundry on 7th Avenue... If you want anything cleaned, laundered, pressed, whatever. All right? The band that we have for you is terrific. I know you've heard this a thousand times, but believe me. When I say they're good, you're gonna love them. Most important: the cabaret card. Cabaret card we took care of. We took care of it. It cost us. I mean, it wasn't easy, but we took care of it. So you're set. Okay? Do you understand everything, Francis? Any questions? - No. You should be all right. Okay? Goodley. - Yeah? When do we start? - You start tomorrow night. Okay, nice and cozy here, huh? Just like Cozy Cole. See you guys later. S.O.S. Same old shit. But maybe you should go by the club and check it out. Will you com e? No. Dale's a little tired. Listen. Those two tables over there. Those people have been waiting for drinks. He's not at his station. That's Dale's kid, right? - Yeah, I called her. You're Chan? Hi, Goodley. Hi, I'm Francis. Nice to meet you. My daughter... Ladies and gentlemen... Our next selection... Is a composition... That I wrote... For my daughter Chan... Who just turned 75. Fourteen. Chan's Song. I liked my song. - Oh, wonderful. Does it have words to it? - No. But not everything has to have words to it. I meant to... Bring you something back from France. You know, like perfume... But I wasn't sure because of your age. I didn't expect anything. I know someone who's been in Paris. He brought this back for me. Oh, I know. From Montmartre. I know. Hey, Dale. When did you get back? How you doing, Booker? - All right. This your child? Daddy lets you stay up late, huh? Heard you the other night, Dale, blowing better than ever. Thanks, man. - Feeling well? Not bad. So how's school? - Fine. Hey, what do you want? I want to see Dale. He's not here. - I'll wait. Tell Dale Booker was here. If he wants something, he'll find me. How is Chan? Like a stranger... And it's too late to fix it. Don't let that happen to you and Berangere. Dale? - Yeah. You were happy in Paris? Very pretty town. Is it the same room where Hershell died? I don't know. They all look the same. Things work different here. Yeah, I see. Feels like far, Francis. - What? Paris. I'm going back, Dale. I've made two reservations. For when? - Tomorrow evening. Is it too soon? There are two flights, at 7:30 and 9:30. If we're going... Let's go early. You know... Lady Francis... There's not enough kindness... In the world. This is the last call for Pan Am flight 7.72 for Paris. All passengers, please proceed to gate 34. 'Dale died Friday at Cumberland Hospital. Goodley.' I'll be late for school. We would like to open with a tribute... To a great jazz musician... S man who died a few years ago. He passed away ahead of us... But he was always doing things ahead' of us. He wrote a song... Just before he died that we'd like to perform tonight for you. His name is Dale Turner. Do you like basketball? Going out? I hope... Lady Francis... That we live long enough... To see an a venue... Nam ea' after Charlie Parker. A Lester Young Park. Duke Ellington Square. Ana' even... A street named Dale Turner.
