23.976 English The Bedroom Window (1987) Hello. I wasn't sure you'd come. I almost didn't. And then I got lost, all turned around. -Nothing looked the same. -Would you like something to drink? Maybe that would be good. Some white wine. White wine? I'm out of white wine right now. How about a beer? It's probably just as well. I've had enough to drink already. Maybe too much. How'd you get away? My sister's having problems... with her husband. I told Collin she needed to see me. At this hour? It's a crisis. What did you say? Thanks for the party. Collin won't miss me. He's your husband. I just work for him. -I don't know what to say. -I don't either. -I've never... -I know. Why did you... Why are you? Because you wanted me to. -And have wanted me for a long time. -I was so obvious? I couldn't ignore it. And I guess I'm to the point where I need to be wanted like that. -Collin... -Oh, don't tell me Collin knew, too. If Collin knew... You know him. What do you think Collin would do if he knew? I don't know. I can't move. Thank God. But I have to. Will you excuse me? I'll be right back. Terry! Terry! What? No! -What is it? What happened? -He was trying to kill her. Who was? Hey, you all right? He's gone now. He had her from behind. He was dragging her toward the street. Be careful with her. There you go. There you go, take my arm. Good, walk... Looks like she's all right. Come on. Come on, they can see you. He was trying to kill her. It took me a moment to realize it was really happening. -Did you see him? -Yes, his face was so white. -Okay, okay, okay. -Oh, I've got to get out of here. I'll walk you to your car. What'd he look like? Twenty, twenty-four. With unbelievable white skin. And red hair, combed back like a duck. -A ducktail? -Yes. You know, if I left any earlier, that could have been me down there. You may have saved my life. The pleasure was mine. In fact, let me go further if I can be of service again. Oh, don't. I can't even think about that now. I'm scared, and later than I should be. And that could be trouble for us both. Any regrets? Not one. In spite of what happened, maybe because of it, it's the most exciting night I can remember. -You? -Regrets? Are you kidding? All right! Rough night last night? -What do you mean? -You're late. Thought maybe you slept in. -He's been asking for you. -Collin? Good luck. I want the concrete on the site. If I get there and find my boys sitting around, pulling their puds... What happened to you last night? Well, see to it that you do. Every last yard of it. -The party... where did you disappear to? -Oh, nowhere. I went home. I saw you talking with my wife and the next thing I knew, you were gone. What's that? It's a beauty, isn't it? Belonged to Bugsy Siegel. Forty years old, never been registered. -Where you'd get it? -A friend. Got it from a friend. Hold it. Feels good, doesn't it? The way it fits in your hand. Almost makes you wish you had a reason to fire it. Excuse me, your paper. -Thank you. -Hi, Terry. Hi, Layla. Well, the market's looking up. How are things coming on the Wooten project? -Hello? -Hmm? Oh, everything's under control. In fact, I better get back to it right now. May I? Be my guest. What's so interesting? Looks like the Mideast is heating up again. You see, that's why I never read the news. Right. What do you think about it? The girl in the news? A few blocks away, less than half an hour later. I think there's a good chance it's the man you saw. Not the same girl, though. Murdered girl was a blonde. -You said the one you saw had brown hair. -God, it's scary. Did the paper say anything else about witnesses? It said there weren't any. Terry, if it was the same man and no one else saw him, I should go forward, give the police a description. You could ask them to keep your identity a secret. What if they wouldn't? It would all come out. -What about a letter? -An anonymous letter. No, they wouldn't pay much attention to it. They would think it was from some crank. Oh, Jesus, Terry. I want to do the right thing. Why should my life be turned upside down just because I happened to look out of the window? It's not fair. Am I terrible? No. What are you doing? -Police department, please. -Terry. I'll tell them what you saw. Only I'll tell them that I saw it. -You can't do that. -It's my apartment, my bedroom window. Why shouldn't I have been the one looking out of it? Hello? Yes, I witnessed an assault last night. Okay. Relax. Relax, they'll probably make a hero out of me. -But you'll be lying. -Hello? Yes. Right, I witnessed an assault last night on a woman, and I thought I better call up about it. Right outside my apartment, near the Washington Monument. 12 East Mount Vernon Place. Terry Lambert. Sure. That's the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. You did that for me. You remember what he looked like? Tell me what he looked like. -Tall, red hair. -Yes. Combed back behind the ears, like this. What was he wearing? Tan jacket, blue jeans, tennis shoes. When you say "tennis shoes" do you mean tennis shoes or running shoes? I mean tennis shoes. And I'm going to make love to you like nobody ever has before. Well, that sounds so good, but I'm not sure you'll have time before they get here. Get here? Terry! The police, they're on their way. Some detective, he sounded very excited. Oh, my God. Terry, you're going to pay for this. Call me when they're gone. No, you better not call, he might be home. I'll meet you on the other side of the Washington Monument in an hour. Mr. Lambert? I'm Detective Quirke, and this is Detective Jessup. -May we come in? -Yeah, sure. Sorry, you got here so fast-- We're anxious to hear what you had to say. Nice apartment. I like these old buildings. -You live here alone? -Yes. -Why? -No reason. Detective Jessup will take notes, if you don't mind. Why don't you start by telling us what happened? What you were doing, what you saw. Well, I'd been to a party. Kind of an office party. -Office? -Wentworth Construction. -Collin Wentworth? You work for him? -Yeah. Anyway, we just closed a big account and we were having a party to celebrate. -I came home early and went to bed. -What time? Around 10:00. And then later at 2:15, I remember because I looked at the clock, I woke up. I heard a scream. Not very loud, kind of muffled, but I could tell it came from the park. I jumped up and I went to the window. -Which window? -The bedroom window. May we see it? -Were the drapes open? -Yes. And what did you see? Right down there. He had her from behind and was sort of dragging her toward the street. She was struggling. And then he threw her down, and started choking her. And that's when she screamed, real loud, -"Help! Help me!"And then he ran away. -Why didn't you call the police? I didn't think it was that important, that I had anything to say until I read about that other girl that was murdered. What made you think there was a connection? A few blocks away, half hour later. Why, am I wrong? No, Mr. Lambert, we think there is a connection, too. And we're very glad you came forward. -Cigarette? -No, I don't smoke. Good for you. -Do you mind? -No. Did you get a good look at the assailant? -Yes. -Describe him, please. Young, early 20s, six foot. Any distinguishing marks or characteristics? Red hair, red hair. Combed back behind the ears in a ducktail. What was he wearing? At an jacket, blue jeans, tennis shoes. Tennis shoes or running shoes? Tennis shoes. When you say tan jacket, do you mean a sports coat or windbreaker? Windbreaker. You have a good eye for detail, Mr. Lambert. He probably came from behind that tree. The girl says the sidewalk was deserted, that he came out of nowhere. She barely saw him at all. By the way, do you know her? -Who? -The girl. She lives just around the corner. No. -She's a lucky one. -Lucky? The other girl was raped, beaten to death, and dumped. You said he was dragging her toward the street. He was trying to get her to his vehicle. She's a lucky one, all right. Mr. Lambert, you said you came back from the party and went right to bed? That's right. Were you alone? Yes, didn't I say that? Not exactly. I was alone. That's why he went to sleep, Dave. I just wanted to make sure. When you said tan jacket, did you mean windbreaker or sports coat? Windbreaker, why? You went shopping? I was so nervous, I didn't know what to do. Tell me what happened. Let's talk as we drive. There's something I want to see. See that building? That's where she lived, the girl that was killed. Come on, I'll show you. Like the girl you saw, this one was attacked on her way home, too. But if it happened so soon after, how did he plan it? How did he know where she lived? Suppose he came driving down the street. You know, he's angry. -Excuse me, please. -Okay. He's frustrated after his aborted attempt outside my place. He stops at that stop sign, right there. Looking over, he sees a car parked in the red, in front of this building. He sees a girl locked in the arms of her lover, having a last goodnight kiss. On impulse, the killer backs up, he sees the side door of the building, he parks, and returns on foot. He plays a hunch. From where the car is parked, he's guessed that the girl lives in the building, and that soon she'll be going inside. He runs up the steps to the front door, where he does something to the lock. Something that'll prevent a key from opening it. Then he slips back down the steps to the side door, to watch and to wait. The girl gets out of the car, waves goodbye, and goes up the steps. She tries to open the door, but she can't. She turns to call after her lover, but he's already speeding away. So she decides to go around to the side door. She never got there. The police told you all that? About the girl? Most of it. The rest was in the paper. I want you to know I really appreciate you helping me do the right thing, giving the police the description. Let's hope it's of some use to them. -When will I see you again? -Soon. Very soon. Here you go. Hey, what's in the bag? A little lunchtime shopping? Just some white wine. You been up to something you shouldn't, old boy? -What do you mean? -A cop was here to see you. Detective Jessup. He wants you to call him at that number. Thanks, Collin. What's it all about? Nothing much. A few nights ago I witnessed an assault on this girl. Sounds interesting. Not a rape, Collin. More of a mugging. No big deal. -Which night? -Which night? Yeah, which night was it? Thursday night. That was the night of the party. Yeah, that's right. Well? Aren't you gonna call him? Yes... I'm gonna call him. You know, cur-- It's Terry Lambert, Detective Jessup. Certainly. Seven o'clock, that'll be fine. They want me to come over, probably go over my statement again. You know the police. No, I don't. Frankly, I'm surprised to see you get so involved. I didn't know you had such a strong sense of civic duty. Hey! This is not bad. I didn't know you appreciated French wine, either. I'm developing a taste for it. Just tell me what you want. Yeah, okay. Just a sec. -Yes? -I'm Terry Lambert. -I'm here to see Detective Jessup... -They're running late. If you have a seat, they'll have it set up in a few minutes. Yeah, where were we? No. Of course... He never lived a day beyond 95. They got him. I don't think I'm going to have that bad of an experience. Hey, thanks. All right. Hold on. Late setting what up? You said they were running late setting something up. You're here for the lineup, aren't you? -Lineup? -Yes. -No, I think I was supposed to... -You must be the one. I mean, they told me there was a witness. Yes. Sorry to keep you waiting. Oh, hi. Of course, you two must have quite a bit to talk about. But I'll have to ask you to refrain from doing so during the proceedings. Right this way. There are six men I want you to look at. Don't worry. They won't be able to see you. I don't wanna disappoint you, but I told you before-- I know, Ms. Connelly. I wanted you to come along because sometimes people see more than they realize. But Mr. Lambert here, -he got a good look at the man. -You did? Well, I... Step right up, gentlemen. Don't be shy. That's right. All the way to the end. Take your time. Look at each one. Very carefully. Face left, gentlemen, please. But you did get a good look at him that night. Good enough to give us that detailed description. But seeing them all together like this, I just can't be sure. But surely if you were to come face-to-face with the man you described in such detail, you'd recognize him, wouldn't you? Yes, I think so. That's the way it goes. Your hunch was wrong. Hunch? One of the men you saw tonight has done this kind of thing before. That, combined with your description... Well, obviously I was wrong. We'll just have to keep looking. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you didn't recognize him. Yeah, me too. I've seen you before. At Edgar's. -I don't think... -I cocktail there. It's not my night for recognizing people. I was walking home from work the night it happened. I don't do that anymore. There's a lot I don't do. Can't do, until I know who he is. They seem pretty sure that the same guy attacked that other girl. Only she's dead and I'm alive. I should feel lucky, I guess. Do you think they'll catch him? I hope so. Well, good night. He's not even telling her about it. That's him. You'll see when he takes his hood off. What if it is him? What do we do? I don't know. First you have to tell me whether it is. Terry, there must be hundreds of young men in Baltimore with red hair. -I don't know why you think... -There! Look. I want you to have a better look. That's him, isn't it? Come on, Sylvia. He's just what you said. The hair, the size, everything. -Even the white skin. -I can't say. -Not for sure. -Why not? I just can't. -But it might be him? -It might be. But what good does that do? What good does any of it do? I couldn't go forward before. It would be worse now. It's different now. If he did what he did to those girls, and we know it. But we don't know it, Terry. -I'm not sure. -That detective, Quirke, he said that one of the men in the lineup was there because he had raped before. But you don't know this is the one he was talking about. I'm sorry, Terry. I know you're disappointed, but there's nothing I can do about it. I'll tell you what. Next time we get together, let's not spend all our time driving around. -Okay? -Okay. What did you say your name was? Can I get you something from the bar? Yeah. A beer. -Draft? -Yeah. Okay. Oh... -Thank you. -Thank you. Lord, have mercy. Table! Table! Joe! Hey, Joe, another round! This one's on me. Yeah, and me making a fool of myself. Here, watch this. Ready for another? No, thank you. Oh, shit! Oh, my God. -I'm so sorry. -No, it's all right. No, really. Here, let me buy you a drink. -It's the least I can do. -It's not necessary. -It's the least I can do. -Okay, okay. Okay? It'll make me feel better. Don't wanna wake 'em. No such luck. Chris? Chris, is that you? You come up here right away. This is a decent house. And I'm tired of you coming at all hours of the night. Don't just stand there like that. I'm telling you, I told you to be in this house before midnight. Now you go down to bed this minute. If this ever happens again, you're packing your things and you're getting out of here. And I mean it! Don't give me that stupid look. Go on down. You be quiet about it down there! Hey, that's it. Let's get her out of here. -What's going on? -A girl's been murdered. They found the body stuffed in there about an hour ago. Any idea who she is? So what do you think? Interesting. Oh, here's Peters. Is this what time you guys in the hall normally go to work? Don't start, huh? I hear you got something. Mr. Lambert... Peters, state's attorney's office. Nice to meet you. Sit down. I understand you've told quite a story. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. Not at all. Why didn't you identify Henderson earlier when you saw him at the lineup? Henderson? That's his name. Chris Henderson. I wasn't sure. I didn't want to make a mistake. So you followed him? Yeah, at night to see him under more similar circumstances. Unusually conscientious. And when you saw him at night, you became positive that he was in fact the man you saw attacking Ms. Connelly? -Yes. -But you still didn't identify him. You waited... -Two days. -Why? I don't know. What do you think? Have we enough for a search warrant? I can go before the judge with Lambert's positive ID, Henderson's record, I might get it. It would help if I could tie Henderson to the dead girls. We've learned that she spent part of last night in a bar, drinking with friends. We're going to take Henderson's picture there, -see if anyone recognizes him. -All right. You let me know right away. I can probably get the warrant without it, but... Thanks, Mr. Lambert. You've been a big help. Well, I only wish that I was of some help sooner. Ah, don't feel badly about it. Even if you had identified Henderson earlier, at the lineup even, they still wouldn't have arrested him. He'd have still been out on the street last night. Our concern is not the assault itself. Except as it helps to build a case of murder. And thanks to you, it's helping. With a search warrant, we may be able to find evidence tying Henderson to the dead girls. If we do, we're off and running. So don't torture yourself about what might have been, huh? What you did was right. There's no doubt about that. I just wish you hadn't had to do it. Tell me that's wrong. That it's not going to come back and hurt us. It won't. My statement's only a tool to help 'em get a search warrant. Beyond that, they don't care about me or the assault you witnessed. But you didn't tell them you followed him to the bar? I couldn't. Either I recognized him at night or I didn't. I had no good reason to keep following him. What if they find out you lied? -They're not interested in me. -But what if they do? No matter what happens, I promise I will not let them find out about you. Hello? Oh, how are you, Detective Quirke? I see. Well, thanks for letting me know. Good luck to you. What? What did he want? -They got the search warrant. -That's what you wanted, isn't it? I guess so, but... Nobody at the bar remembered Henderson. But they got the search warrant anyway? Yeah, they had my statement. He said that was enough. Anyway... that'll be the end of it. Either they'll find something to connect him to the murders or they won't. But either way, they'll be done with me. The search was somewhat disappointing. No fingerprints, no blood samples, no clothing. Nothing to prove Henderson ever came in contact with the murdered women. Some cotton fibers that match up to the sweater of one of the girls, but it's a common fiber. We did find a handful of peppermint-flavored toothpicks in the glove compartment of the truck. Toothpicks? Each of the two murdered girls was prevented from entering her residence by a toothpick jammed into the keyhole of the door lock, and then broken off so her key wouldn't work. The newspaper said he had done something to the locks. We held back about the toothpicks. So what happens now? I'll let Peters explain. Jesus Christ, that Holden is a ball-breaking judge. -You filled him in? -I was just starting to. All right. Here's how it shapes up. We got a murder case we can't win. Some insignificant cotton fibers, some toothpicks that anyone could possess. My assistant has learned that particular brand is given away at half a dozen restaurants in the Baltimore area. I don't understand. Are you saying that he didn't do it? Not at all. He could've raped the girls, hammered them to death with his fists in the back of his truck. He could've thrown away the gloves he wore, any articles of clothing with blood on them. A car wash would've taken care of the flatbed of his truck. What I'm saying is we can't prove that he did it. So, I recommended, Detective Quirke has agreed, -we go with the assault case. -What do you mean? We prosecute Henderson on the assault case. -The assault case? -We can win that one. I mean, it's open and shut. We got a witness who saw him do it. You. But you said you didn't care about the assault case. I don't. Not if there's a chance for getting him for murder, but... we're up against it. Listen, we are not giving up on the murder cases. We might get lucky when he's in prison. You mean someone may kill him? I doubt we'll get that lucky. No, what I meant was that Henderson might shoot off his mouth to somebody, somebody who wants to make a deal with us. Then we nail him. Meanwhile, he's tucked away, where he can't hurt anybody else. So, how do you feel about being a star witness, huh? I... -This isn't what I thought would happen. -Don't worry. It'll be a breeze. All you gotta do is tell the truth. But that's exactly what you said would not happen. You'll have to take the stand, testify under oath. -How do you think I feel about it? -Oh, damn it. Why did I have to look out that window? Why did you have to call the police? If this guy's not put away, he could kill again. He can do whatever he wants. All he's being tried for is assault. What a mess. It's not your mess. It's mine. And whatever happens, I'll protect you from it. So far, all you've done is grandstand. First for me, and now for them. You believe that? From the beginning, you wanted to play the hero. And now you see where it's gotten us. And I am the one with everything to lose. Sylvia. Hey. I thought it was you. How long have you... What are you doing? What does it look like? I'll walk awhile if you like. Oh, I'm... I'm going... I was happy to hear they're gonna prosecute on your identification. What happened? You thought about it later and were sure? Something like that. -How have you been? -I'm better. I'm doing things like this now. I used to run at night. Mostly I'm just waiting to testify. That's all I think about. I'm nervous. Are you? A little, I guess. And your testimony is so much more important than mine. But I wanna get him. Even if that means I have to get up on the stand, that's okay. Whatever it takes, I want to get him. You must feel the same way. Yeah. Well... I just want to tell you how much it means to me. To see someone like you, who's not afraid to come forward and get involved. I'm not doing so much. You're telling the truth. That's more than most people would do. See you in court. Okay. Oh, Terry. I'm so ashamed. Do you hate me? No. Of course I want to stand by you. I'm scared, Terry. That's all. I know. So am I. You forgive me? Do you? Let's go upstairs. I want to. I didn't... And I want to come to the trial. When you testify, you'll be testifying for both of us. You'll be saying the words, but they'll be my words. And I'll be right there with you. This way. -State your name for the court, please. -Terry Lambert. Place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand. Do you swear that the evidence you're about to give the court and the jury in this action is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? -Yes. -Please take the stand. This won't take long, Mr. Lambert. What were you doing on the night of April 21st at 2:15 in the morning? I was looking out my window in my bedroom. And your bedroom window overlooks the park -on East Mount Vernon Place? -Yes. What did you see? A man fighting with a woman, on the steps by the fountain. -Physically fighting? -Yes. Would you describe, as exactly as you are able, what happened in this fight? He had hold of her from behind, -trying to drag her-- -Objection. -Conclusion. -Sustained. Was he dragging her? -Yes, toward the street. -And then what happened? She was fighting, and he threw her down on her face on the pavement, grabbed hold of her neck and started to strangle her. And what did you do? I went to open my window and yell, and she screamed, and he ran away. I'd like you to look around this courtroom. Do you see the man you saw attack that girl? -Yes. -Would you please point him out? Let the record show the witness is pointing at the defendant. Mr. Lambert, you're sure the defendant is the man you saw? Yes, I am. Thank you, Mr. Lambert. One moment, Mr. Lambert. There are two lawyers in this case. Sir... I would like to take you through this one more time, perhaps with a little more detail. Now, you were in your apartment on East Mount Vernon Place on the night of April 21st, looked out your bedroom window and you saw a man fighting with a woman. Is that correct? -Yes. -What time was that? -Around 2:00. -Two o'clock in the morning. What were you doing just prior to looking out the window? Just prior? Yes. Were you watching television? -Reading a book? Chatting with friends-- -I was sleeping. -In your bed? -Yes. You hadn't dozed off in a chair in front of the television, maybe? No, I was in my bed. What time did you go to bed? Around 11:00. And you'd been to a party that night, isn't that correct? Yes. Did you have much to drink? No, in fact, I came home early. I'd been working pretty hard on a job, and I was tired. So you went home, you went to bed, planning to get a good night's sleep. Yes. So there you are, sound asleep at two o'clock in the morning. What woke you up? I heard a scream. -A single scream? -No, there were two screams. Not very loud, kind of muffled. -What did you do? -Got up and I went to the window. You heard screams, you got up, you went to the window. -Did you turn on a light? -No. Did you stop to get a drink of milk or go to the bathroom? -No, I hurried to the window. -You hurried to the window. And that's when you saw this man and woman fighting on the steps of the fountain. What did you do then? I went to open the window, but it stuck, and then the woman screamed and the man ran away. Did he run away as soon as she screamed? Well, she screamed twice, "Help. Help me." And the man ran away. I think. Well, it all happened pretty quickly. -How quickly? -What? You saw these two people fighting, you struggled with your window, the woman screamed, the man ran away, and it all happened very quickly. How quickly? Come on, Mr. Lambert. Five seconds? It must have been longer than that. -It must have been? -For all that to happen. Yeah... you know. Well, why don't we just say you saw this man... Yeah. ...for a brief and fleeting period of time, during most of which he was moving quickly. -Would that be an accurate statement? -Yes. Now, Mr. Lambert, how far would you say it is from your bedroom window to the fountain steps? I don't know. Fifteen yards? Would it surprise you to hear that it's 22 yards? It's 22 yards? I never measured. Well, we did measure it. Yeah. And the night of April 21st, was that a clear night? It rained earlier, but it was pretty clear. So visibility was good? There are streetlights all over. Yes, I was just coming to the streetlights. There are three of them, aren't there, spaced along the block? Yes, park's pretty well-lit. -Well-lit? Is that what you would say? -Oh, yeah. Is it as well-lit as this courtroom? No. Oh, no. -You're sure? -Of course I'm sure. -Of course you're sure. -Yeah. Your Honor, with your permission, I'd like to try a little experiment. Objection, Your Honor. What kind of experiment? This experiment is relevant? I think so, Your Honor. It'll take two minutes at the most. We can indulge the defense counsel for two minutes. Proceed. Thank you, Your Honor. Now, let's see. Well, one thing before we begin. Mr. Lambert, would you kindly remove your contact lenses? What? Your contact lenses. You're wearing them, aren't you? Yes. -Then kindly remove them. -Your Honor-- It's very simple, Your Honor. Mr. Lambert wears contact lenses, hard lenses. That's true, isn't it? -Yes. -The kind that irritate your eyes if they're left in too long or if you sleep with them in. And he surely would have taken them out on the night in question when he went to bed, planning to get a good sleep. That's true, isn't it? Yes. And he just got through telling us that when he was awakened by the sound of screaming, he hurried to the window without making any stops. So surely he won't now try to tell us that he took the time in the dark to put in his contact lenses. You won't try to tell us that, will you? No, I didn't have them in. So I repeat my request that you remove them for the purpose of this experiment. I think you'd better accede to this request and remove them. -Here. -I... No. I... I have a lens case. Now, Mr. Lambert, the distance between us is 20 yards. Two yards less than the distance from your bedroom window to the fountain steps. Bailiff, would you please turn out the lights? Your Honor, I must object again. If we are to have a recreation of the circumstances under which the witness observed the defendant, surely it should be done by experts in the proper manner. Let's indulge the defense counsel for his two minutes. Frankly, I'm more than a little curious as to where this is heading. -Proceed. -Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Lambert, I'm holding in my hand an object. Would you kindly tell the court what this object is? It's a... You're holding... Come on, Mr. Lambert. What is it? Red book. I can't quite make it out. I... Come on, Mr. Lambert. What is it? This is... Red book. Book. It's a book. No! Oh, no! Shall I give you a hint, Mr. Lambert? Is it a cap? Is it a lady's slipper? It isn't by any chance a red wig, is it? Well, let's try it with the lights on. How about now, Mr. Lambert? I can see... I can see that something's there. But you can't identify it. Not even with the lights on. It's a book, Mr. Lambert. Just a red book. You can see why the Motor Vehicles Administration stipulates on your license that you're only to drive while wearing corrective glasses or contact lenses. You're short-sighted, aren't you? Yes. In fact, you're extremely short-sighted. I don't know about extremely. Don't trifle with the court, Mr. Lambert. Would you not agree that a person who failed to distinguish an object in a brightly-lit courtroom from a distance of 20 yards could fairly be described as extremely short-sighted? Yes. And would you not also agree that it would be unlikely at best that an extremely short-sighted person could positively identify someone glimpsed, at night, from 22 yards away, for only a few frantic seconds? Why the fuck didn't you say you were near-sighted? -You never asked. -How do you think he find out? His assistant probably checked with the Motor Vehicles Administration. Accused assailant Chris Henderson was released today, the case against him dismissed for insufficient evidence. Meanwhile, Baltimore police report no new leads on the so-called "Dumpster Murders." Excuse me. Excuse me. Could I talk to you, please? I'm your neighbor. Yeah. It's funny how two people can live so close, and... My name is Kathy, Kathy Hoffner. -Terry Lambert. -Yeah, I know. Oh, please excuse the way I look. I'm such a slob today. I heard your footsteps on the stairs and I thought it was probably you, so I just threw this robe on and came to the door. Right. Well, I was just getting home. Well, I didn't know whether to say anything at first, but... I just feel so funny about talking behind anybody's back. Talk to who? The police. The police? Oh, you mean back then. Well, I talked to them back then, too. They asked me if I was awakened by the attack, if I'd seen anything. But they were here again today. Today? And this time they asked me if I had seen you that night. Seen me? What... At first I thought I hadn't, and then I remembered that later I had peeked out when I heard some footsteps coming up the stairs. I was nervous after what had happened. What did you see? I saw you coming back in. This was later after the excitement had died down. Yeah, I went out for some air. Did you happen to see me when I went out? The police asked me the same question. No, I just saw you coming back in. Must have been after 3:00. Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that late, no. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Thanks for letting me know about the police. Anytime. Anytime at all. You heard they let him go. Sickening, isn't it? Want a beer? Thanks, I would. So that's the famous bedroom window? Yeah. Do you mind? I know, Terry. What? I know. It wasn't you in the bedroom window at all. -What are you talking about? -She was the witness. -She saw it, not you. -Who? Look, I'm as disappointed as you are that they let him go... -You went forward for her. -Doesn't mean I wasn't telling the truth. Save it, Terry. I saw her in the park and I saw her in court coaching you. Pathetic. What, is she married? Must be, to someone powerful. It doesn't matter, really. What matters is he's out there free. There's nothing that can be done about that. They can't try him again. Not for attacking me. But with some more information, they might be able to get him for what he did to the others. The girls that didn't have someone like you to protect them. What are you gonna do? The question isn't what am I going to do, it's what are you going to do, and what is she going to do? Now it's my turn to watch. Thanks for the beer. Terry. Yeah? The cops have been here. They just left. Here? They want me to call them? They don't want to talk to you. -They wanted to talk about you. -About me? How long you've been here, what you're like. They also want to know about the night of that party we had. What your mood was, why you left early. It's almost as though they suspect you of something. Did they ask anything else? If I'd noticed anything unusual about you on April 26th or 27th. What? They think you keep a diary of my moods? Why would they ask about those dates in particular? Who knows? Anyway, thanks, Collin. I'm sorry they bothered you. Hey, wait for me! The police don't know about you. Not yet. They've been questioning my neighbors. I think they've tapped my phone. And they've been watching me. That's not all. Denise Connelly saw us together. She saw you in court. She's figured it out. I don't know what you're talking about. Tapped your phone? Terry, you made a mistake, a simple mistake. The police wouldn't do that. They were at the office this morning, questioning Collin. -Collin? -That's right. -Why would they question Collin? -About me! Sylvia. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Do they suspect you were with somebody? I don't know what they suspect. It looks like they're wondering if maybe I didn't kill those girls. It makes sense in a crazy sort of way, that I've been trying to put the blame on somebody else. It doesn't make any sense. It's ridiculous. You're being paranoid. Anyway, what did they talk to Collin about? They asked him about April 26th. That's the date of the second murder. They also asked him about the night of the party. Why I left early. The party... What if Collin starts thinking about the party? In one way, that would partially solve our problems. -What do you mean? -If Collin put two and two together, you wouldn't need to be so afraid to go to the police. Go to the police? I can't do that. You know that. You've always known. Besides, I think you're exaggerating the whole thing. And what about the redhead, Henderson? -What about him? He got off. -If you'd testified, he wouldn't have. I never said it was him. I was never sure. You made up your own mind about that. If it was him, he could do it again. Stop it, Terry. That's not fair. It's not my fault this is happening. Besides, it will work out. -The police aren't fools. -What about Denise Connelly? -Who? -The girl that was attacked. She knows all about us. Go to her. Tell her we need a little time. I have to think. She'll be reasonable, won't she? -Maybe. -She has to be. I didn't get us into this. You know that. I have to go now. I do. I never even knew you wore contact lenses. A little reverse angle should have been all right, Alan. Thanks, Denise. -Hello. -Hi. I need to talk. I'll be right back. -Cece, cover me, will ya? -Okay. I talked to her. I told her about you, told her about the police. Now, the police seem to have gotten it into their heads that maybe I had something to do with what happened to those girls. They know you lied, they just don't know why. -Yeah. -Did you see any of it that night? No. She saw it, but she wouldn't go forward, so you took her place. -I thought I could bring it off. -And she let you? Yeah. You're either a romantic fool or you're an idiot. I don't know which is worse. What does she say now, now that you're in a spot? She wants to wait, give time to the police to sort it out. Nice. -You don't understand her position. -Sure I do. She has a husband, a stud on the side, and nobody the wiser. She wants to keep it that way. Denise... Yeah. So what are you gonna do now? I did what I did. If I had it to do over, I'd do it differently. But it was my idea to handle it the way we did, and I don't think it's fair for me to force Sylvia to pay the consequences unless she's come to the same conclusion I have. -Not yet. -Like I said. A romantic fool. What about Henderson? What does she wanna do about him? She's not sure it was Henderson and she never was. But you were sure. That doesn't make any sense. I know. It's a long story and I'd like to tell it to you someday, I would. But right now, Denise, all I want is a little more time. Denise, seriously. A little more time, okay. But I'm giving the time to you, not to her. You're the romantic fool. She knows exactly what she's doing. Mr. Lambert. Good morning. Would you mind coming with me? Detective Quirke and I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes. Shall I follow you? That's okay. I'll bring you back. Mr. Lambert. It seems you haven't been exactly truthful with us. -Oh, yes. I'm sorry about the contacts. -That's our fault. We should've asked. I'm not talking about that. We've learned that you went out that night. -You told us you were in bed. -Yes. That you were awakened, you witnessed the attack, -and then you went right back to bed. -Yes, I did go out. I... I forgot. -You forgot? -Yes, I... Yeah, I did. It's, it's... When did you go out? Afterwards. Before I went back to sleep. I went out to... get some air and look around. I was all keyed up, so it's... When did you come back? A few minutes later. That's why I forgot. Look, I know that you've been questioning my neighbors and my boss, and you've been having me followed. But... I... Look, you don't really think that I'm... I'm not a suspect, am I? Suppose you tell us about the bar. -What bar? -The Fells Point Saloon, where the murdered girl, Stephanie Luty, spent the last hours of her life, where no one, no one, can remember having seen the redhead Chris Henderson. Cocktail waitress remembers you quite clearly. She spilled a drink on you. Was that something else you forgot? Where did you get that picture? -Am I... Are you arresting me? -No. Not just yet. We're moving a little slower this time around. I don't think I should answer any more questions until I consult an attorney. That might be well-advised. Hello? It's Terry, Sylvia. What are you doing? You can't just call here. -We have to talk. -That's impossible. -I have to see you right away. -No. I can't see you. I can't see you at all anymore. Sylvia, you don't know what's been going on. I've been to the police... It doesn't matter. I can't see you and I can't talk to you. -Sylvia, don't make me do... -I have to go now. -Don't hang up on me! -Goodbye. Who was that, dear? Terry. Terry Lambert. -Yes? May I help you? -Tell Mrs. Wentworth it's Terry Lambert. Was she expecting you? I'm sorry, but she isn't here. -Will you tell her or shall I? -She's not here. -No one's here. -Where are they? Damn it, where have they gone? The ballet. They've gone to the ballet. -What is he doing here? -I don't know. I'm going to talk to him. What are you doing here? You hung up on me, you gave me no choice. Are you crazy? People will see us and Collin... We've gone past where any of that matters. -You may have, I haven't. -It's all going to come out. Our affair, the fact that you witnessed the attack, everything. I told you I would never, never tell the police about that. -Sylvia... -I told you that from the start. Don't touch me! Don't you understand? They suspect me of murder. I've been followed. They may have followed me here. They may be watching me right now. If you won't listen to reason, then you leave me no choice but to talk to Collin myself. I'm sorry, Terry, but it's too late for that. -What do you mean? -I've already told him. -I had a feeling... -Told him what? That I went to bed with you. Once. He's forgiven me. On the condition I swear I was in bed with him the night of the party. What? He doesn't want to be dragged into that mess. -I told him I would. -Hey! -Are you all right? -Yeah, thank you. I'm fine. I had to. I had no choice. And I told him you've been after me ever since to continue the affair. To say I was with you when I wasn't. So you see, you'll have to find some other way to solve your problems. There is no other way. With or without you, I'm going to the police. Well, you do what you have to do. And I'll do what I have to do. Goodbye. Tell me one thing. It was him, wasn't it? -The redhead. -Let go of me, please. You were sure, weren't you? Right from the beginning. You were sure it was Henderson. All right. I was sure. Of course I was sure. There's nothing wrong with my eyes. The act is almost over. -It would be better to wait. -Of course. What's going on? Sylvia. Jesus. You bastard! -Grab him! -Collin, let me... He stabbed my wife! Get him! He killed my wife! Stop him! Call the police! He's a killer! Hey, you're not supposed to be back here. Hey! Rick! Rick! Security! Get security. Yeah, he's going toward the back door! Tonight, Baltimore's social community is shocked over the murder of one of its own. But police refuse to speculate whether the slaying of Sylvia Wentworth, here at the Townson Theater, is connected to the so-called "Dumpster Murders." Peter, turn that up. It is known that Terrence Lambert, an employee of the dead woman's husband, Collin Wentworth... -Denise, isn't that the guy... -...was a witness to an earlier assault. Police are seeking him for questioning. Craig Jehelka reporting. Thank you, Craig, for that live minute cam report. In Chesapeake Bay today, hundreds of schoolchildren swarmed aboard the... Denise... Denise! -You forgot your jacket. -Oh, my God, I don't believe it. Well, here it is. Goodnight. Yeah. -Thanks, Peter. -Goodnight. -So what do you want me to do? -Go to the police with me. I'll tell them everything and try to get them to believe me. You'd seen us together. You saw Sylvia at the trial. Why shouldn't she be at the trial? A lot of people were. But, Denise, you know she was the real witness. I can say I think that. I can't prove it. Those people at the Townson Theater will say they think you killed her. I led him straight to her. I knew I was being followed, but it never occurred to me that it might be Henderson. And he couldn't have planned it better. He got rid of the one person that could implicate him and the one person that could clear me. So now it looks like I was trying to shift the blame from the beginning. Let's go upstairs. -Want a beer? -Yeah. Tell me something. Even when you knew I was lying, you didn't suspect me like the police. Why? I knew something the police didn't. Remember the first time we met, the lineup? How could I forget? I knew something was wrong even then. It was obvious you'd never seen me before from your bedroom window or anyplace else. And you were completely indifferent to what you did see. Not flattering, perhaps, but upon reflection, trustworthy. You weren't interested in fucking me, and you certainly weren't interested in killing me. You weren't interested. Period. He'll do it again, you know. Kill some girl, or try to. I'll be safe in jail, the perfect alibi. -I wonder what sets him off. -Who knows? Between the two of us, we know more about it than anybody. You were there that night at the bar when he picked out that sorority girl. The night he attacked me, I don't remember him at the bar, but he was probably there, watching me. Do we look alike at all, that other girl and me? Not really. What made him single her out? What made him notice her in particular? Everybody noticed her. -What do you mean? -She danced. Danced? To a record? Yeah, she was good, too, with her friends cheering her on. She was sexy. You didn't dance for him, did you? Sure. On a Thursday night, the place is packed. I don't have time to breathe. Did anything unusual happen that night? It was Peter's birthday. -Peter? -The bartender. I remember because the next day after what happened he told me I should've given him the present he wished for. He wanted me to go home with him. What happened that was so unusual? At midnight... We'd gotten him a cake. And at midnight, Cece and I brought it out. Hey, you guys, this one's for Peter! ? Happy birthday to you ? Happy birthday to you ? Happy birthday, dear Peter ? Happy birthday to you Peter made a wish and blew out all the candles. And then I kissed him. Yes, I kissed him. And everybody laughed and cheered, and so I kissed him again and they cheered even louder. Then he kissed me. I mean, he really kissed me. And everybody went crazy. But you don't remember him there? Henderson? No. But they didn't remember him at that other bar, either. The one where you saw him. -Another beer? -Yeah. Two victims, both young, both pretty, both were in bars where they could be watched by him, and both did something that made them the center of attention. Something sexual. Something that would excite a normal guy gets him angry. Maybe he gets excited, too, but he wants to kill. What a guy. So what are you gonna do? What can I do? I'll take my chances with the police. Do you know any lawyers? Yeah, a guy I used to go to school with. I thought I'd give him a call. Might be better to go in with somebody. You can stay here tonight, if you want. On the couch. Call him in the morning. Did you love her? Sylvia. Love... You could probably call it a crush. I didn't really know her, as we've seen. I was just something for her to do. I can think of worse things to do. Here. -You're awake. -What time is it? About 4:30. Listen, why don't you come into my room? I'd like you to. I find you attractive. I mean, that's not true. That is true, but... that's not the real reason. Ever since that night, I haven't been able to... to do certain things. Tonight I think I could. I mean, if you... want to. Come here. Come here. There's a bed in there. What's wrong with this? Nothing, I guess. Terry! Come here! What's wrong? Wait a second. Things are definitely looking better to me this morning. Me too. I was thinking... You know how we were saying last night about it only being a matter of time with Henderson, -that sooner or later he'll kill again? -Yeah. -And that would clear up your problem. -What about it? It could happen sooner instead of later, -with a little help. -What do you mean? Think about it. What's going to get him going? Some girl who could inadvertently push his buttons. Now that could take a long time. What if some girl who knew what buttons to push deliberately set about pushing them? A girl that was his type. Forget it. -Why? -I won't let you. -Why? -It's dangerous. -Not if you help. We won't let it be. -No, I said forget it. Thank you, I appreciate the offer. -It's no more than you did for her. -What did you say about that? That I was either a romantic fool or an idiot. I was probably both. You know, if I want to go ahead, you couldn't stop me. -Oh? -You'd be in custody, remember? I don't want to deflate your ego, but I do have my own reasons for wanting him caught. He assaulted me. -If I thought you were serious... -You'd help me. It would never work. He wouldn't go for you again. -He'd know it was a trap. -Not if he didn't recognize me. You just don't think I'm sexy enough to make him try. Why wouldn't he recognize you? Because, Terry, I'm a woman, in case you still haven't noticed. How do I look? Detective Quirke, it's Terry Lambert. Never mind that now. You've got it all wrong. I want to give myself up. I do. But just to you... and Detective Jessup. Well, there's something I want you to do. No, not now. Tonight. One more day won't make a difference. Look, just be at this number after 10:00. I'll tell you about it then. Just be there. What did he say? -What did you do to your eyebrows? -Dyed. Fake eyelashes. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah. -Why would he have to work late tonight? -Why not? What if he doesn't go out? What if he goes home after work? Then that's it. I call Quirke. Look. Now, remember, stay back a little. Watch me in your rearview mirror. I'll be right behind you. Go. You better hurry, go. We don't get separated, no matter what happens. If you lose me, stop, wait for me to catch up. -But by then, he'd... -That's right, let him go. -We don't get separated. -Go on. -No matter what. Agreed? -Agreed! Come on, come on. Come on. Come on! Not one of your better places in town. There's a phone booth right back there. Let's go over it one more time. I go in and try to set the hook. If it looks like he's gonna go for it-- I call Quirke, tell him what's happening. Get over to your place and meet me there. I drive home with Henderson following. If he goes for me, Quirke's there to see it. -You have the Mace? -It's in my pocket. ? And that's a cold shot, baby ? Yeah, that's a drag... Whoo, mama! A beer and a bump. -A shooter of schnapps? -Fine. ? Now I see you out somewhere ? You won't give me The time of day ? And that's a cold shot Darling ? Yeah, that's a drag Yeah, is Detective Quirke there, please? No, that's okay. I just want to make sure he's there. -What's this? -Compliments of Jace. In the blue shirt. Well, isn't that nice? ? You are my life ? You are my love ? You are my everything ? You make me high ? When I am down ? You make me laugh and sing ? Come as you want Come as you are ? Girl, come into my life ? You are my girl ? My number one star ? I might make you my wife... ? Girl, come into my life ? Sweet and sexy thing -You play? -Sometimes. Let's do it. -Play for drinks? -Play for fun. I'll buy you another drink. Leon, a couple of beers and a bump. Solids. Nice stroke. A smooth stroke is the key to this game. A smooth stroke is the key to more than just this game. Concentration is also important. No, I know, you guys! Here, watch this. Yeah, and me making a fool of myself. Nice try. What are you doing? He'll see you. I'm calling Quirke now. -Why? How do you know he'll follow me? -He won't. He knows where you live. Your wallet. He saw it. He did the same thing the other time, I just didn't remember. That's how he's able to screw up the lock. Then he's going for it. Looks like it. If I'm right, he'll leave here before you do and be waiting at your place. Damn it. -And what? -Hi. You slept there? Hi. I've got an important phone call. Is it okay if I just... Some guy, standing there talking to me, some shit. I don't know. -Look, I'm sorry... -Look, geek. Wait your turn or find another phone. I'm sorry to bother you, but it's very, very important. How long will you be? Ow. ? Set me free Why don't you, baby? Okay. Hey. I've waited. I can't wait any longer. I'll pay you. I'll give you whatever you want... -Take a walk, buddy. -You don't... No. Just another freak on the street. Beat it! I mean it! Eight ball in the corner pocket. Well, I gotta go. -I want a rematch. -Next time. Hey, how am I gonna win that drink back? We didn't play for drinks, remember? Well, you ain't going home alone, are you? Look, I appreciate you buying me the drink, but that's all you bought. -Let go of my arm. -What if I don't? Then these... These will be in that corner pocket right along with the eight ball. Hey! I don't know what your problem is. I have no idea... -You want the phone? -Yes. -That's exactly... Yes. -Here. Hey! No! Hey, get off of me, man! Denise! No! All right, hey. Hey! Break it up! Come on. Hey! Hey, come on. On your feet. What the fuck's the matter with you? You deaf? -Come on, I want to see some ID, now. -I was using the phone! I'm trying to call Detective Quirke, Officer... Save it! ID now. All right, buddy. Come on. Over up against the phone booth. Up against the phone booth. Spread your legs! -Spread 'em! -There's no time. It's an emergency Hey, quiet. Just put your arms up. -Come on. -Don't touch me, you mother... Spread 'em. That's it. Nice and quiet. Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! One-Adam 16, one-Adam 16. See the woman, Washington Street. Cross street Harvard. Hello? Can you hear me? Can anybody hear me? Hello? Police frequency, clear line. -Good, you can hear me? -Police frequency, clear line. Listen, I wanna... Can I talk to Detective Quirke? This is a police frequency, clear the line. Listen, bitch. I know this is a police frequency. I've just stolen a police car. Now let me speak to Detective Quirke. This is not a telephone. If you wish to make a telephone call, get out of the car you have stolen and go to a telephone. Can anybody else out there hear me? Any other police cars? Negative. No one but me. Then relay this. This is Terry Lambert, I've just stolen a police car, and I'm on my way to Denise Connelly's apartment. -The address? -7345 Monument Street. It's near the square. Quirke knows the building. Just tell Detective Quirke. Tell everybody. Help! Help me! Somebody! Help! You! Come here, mother... -Denise! -I'm okay. -He can't get away. -No, Terry. They'll think I did this, too! Terry! Hey! Ow! Down there! Help him! Help him. Don't shoot! Oh, shit! We'd have gotten him anyway, you know. Eventually, we would've muddled through. What did you put in his ignition? A toothpick? -A paper clip. -Cute. So what happens now? For your friend here, there's still the matter of perjury and obstruction of justice. I'd say he's looking at... ten to 12 years. Just kidding. Get yourself a good lawyer. You seemed like such a level-headed girl. That was a stupid play you made tonight. You're lucky it turned out all right. You both are. DVD Subrip NTSC ? 26.05.2019
