Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. I'm the theatre manager. And I would like to show you what happened inside Joe's teeth. Two tiny trolls called Karius and Baktus lived there. They're the main characters in our play. And now the first act starts. Hey, Karius, we've chipped and chopped all day. - Our house is big enough now. - No. It's got to be much bigger. We get so many sweets nowadays, that we're growing by the hour. - So come on, little brother! - Alright, let's keep going then! - Hey, Karius... - What? Why don't we build a house up there in that molar. I'd be much happier up there. Don't you see, we're much safer down here? What if that nasty toothbrush should come? Toothbrush? Joe never brushes his teeth. He did brush them once, I remember. Yes, once. That was weeks ago. We can feel safe here in Joe's mouth. Well then, do what you want. I'm going to live here. I'll have a much nicer house than you, Karius. Just imagine when there are lots of us with houses in every tooth. Then I can be like a king in my castle, overlooking the whole mouth! You're such a dreamer. I'm not sure there'll be so many of us. It depends if we get enough candy. Candy, candy. We get so many sweets we're almost bursting these days. 1 can remember a time when Joe never ate sweets. I thought I'd die of hunger. Why talk about nasty things, Karius? You always talk about carrots and broccoli. Look, here comes dinner! It's probably just brown bread. No Karius, it's cookies with delicious icing! Great! Hip, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah. We're enjoying life today. Living here is very handy, with delicious sugar candy. Every hour that goes by Joe increases our supply. Oh, the icing is so nice, and today we've had it twice. That was the first act. The two rascals are very happy. But Joe, who's teeth they are, isn't so happy about having them. As you know small cavities and bacteria ruin your teeth. And it really hurts too. Everyone knows that toothache is one of the worst things in the world. You will hear more about that in the second act, - - which takes place two days later. Hello Karius, are you down there? - Can't you hear I'm busy? - What are you doing? I'm making a tunnel to your tooth. - Good idea! - How are you doing up there? Extremely well. I love the view. White mountain tops as far as the eye can see. - What's that funny noise? - Shh! Let's listen. I have such bad toothache! - It's only Joe complaining. - Can you hear what he's saying? He is saying, "I have such bad toothache!" - What a cry-baby. - I'll tease him a bit. Just wait. I'll hammer where I know it hurts. Listen now! - Did you hear anything? - Yes, he's saying "Ouch, ouch, ouch!" - Do it again, Karius. - Okay. Listen. Mum, I have such bad toothache! - You must brush your teeth, Joe. - Who was that? That was Joe's mother. She said, "You must brush your teeth, Joe." Goodness, Baktus! What if he uses the horrible brush! We must talk him out of it and tell him not to listen to his mother. Never do what your mother tells you to! Never do what your mother tells you to! He's doing it anyway. I heard him pour water into a glass. Oh, help! Here comes the brush! Come down here. It's much safer. Help! Help! Yuck! Pooh! That toothpaste is making me feel sick! Oh! What a terrible noise! He finally stopped. Do you think it's safe to go out? Careful, careful. - Oh, what an awful sight! - What happened? Everything's gone. Not a scrap of food left. Not a single crumb... All that once was sweet and good. All our lovely sticky food. Not a crumb of cake to lick. What a very dirty trick. Nothing more to eat today. Everything is brushed away. Nothing soft and nothing sweet. Nothing left for us to eat. When Joe had brushed his teeth, things got a bit better. But the cavities were still there, - - and in the morning the two small fellows began hacking away again. Then his mother gave him some good advice. You'll see the result in the third act, which takes place at the dentist. - Why are you so angry, Karius? - I'm starving. - We'll soon get some sweets. - Doesn't look like it. - Can we try and talk to Joe? - Talk, talk. He won't listen to us. - Maybe if we shout together. - What do we shout? - That we want cookies. - Okay, let's try it. We want cookies! We want cookies! Open, please. - Do you hear anything? - There was a man talking. - What did he say? - He said, "Open, please." Perhaps it was the baker! - He's opening his mouth. - I hope there is icing on it. My goodness. How long is he going to keep it open? What a horrid bright light. It's like the sun is shining in. - What do you think it is? - Climb up and have a look, Baktus. - Can you see anything? - Oh! There's a huge light ten times bigger than the sun! - Oh my! Anything else? - I see a man in a white coat. - A dentist! - Is that bad? - Yes! They fill in our houses. - Oh, Karius, I'm scared! Shush! What's that noise? - It's a big shiny, buzzing thing. - Oh no! It's the drill! It's coming closer. What are we going to do? We must run for it! Come on, Baktus! - He's drilling in our houses! - I'm so cross! - Let's go and bite the drill! - No, it's too hard! - We could attack the dentist's teeth. - No! Dentists are impossible to fight. I wish there wasn't a single dentist in all the world. He's spraying our houses with water. He's filling in my lovely molar house. - I'm going to bite him! - Stop! He'll wash you away. - He's even filling in your house! - Stop it! - Hey dentist, will you stop it! - He can't hear us. - He doesn't want to hear us. - Now it's too late, he's finished. My wonderful house with a lovely view, all gone. And gone is my big cave house. It's all gone, everything. Not even a teeny, weenie, tiny hole left for us. Oh, where can we spend the night? All the teeth are smooth and tight. After being shocked at first, I'm so angry I could burst, We are both so very small. We can't fight the drill at all. We can just sit down and weep, 'cause we have no place to sleep. Now we're back home. Joe is pleased because the cavities are gone. But what about Karius and Baktus? Not so good. In the final act, you'll find out what became of them. - These are bad times, Baktus. - Yes, Karius, very bad. - No sweets to eat and nowhere to live. - No sweets to eat and nowhere to live. - We can sleep in this corner tonight. - I'm too angry to sleep, Baktus. He's opening his mouth. Maybe it's something good. - I bet it isn't. - Help me up so I can see. - See anything? - I can see... Oh no! - What is it? - It's the toothbrush again! - What shall we do? - There's nowhere to go! - No holes to hide in. Mercy, Joe! - We'll never hurt you again! - We must hide! - But where? - Help, the brush is after me! - Hang on, Baktus! Brush, let go! That's what happened to Karius and Baktus. The toothbrush came that evening and they had no cavities to hide in. They were washed out of Joe's mouth, along with the toothpaste and foam, - - down the drain and out into the big blue ocean. And now they're sailing around looking for another tooth cavity to move into. Maybe you feel sorry for Karius and Baktus? But there's one person who's happy with the way things turned out, - - and that's Joe, who's teeth they were.
