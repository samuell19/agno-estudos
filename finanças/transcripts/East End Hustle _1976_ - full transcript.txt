[ALARM CLOCK] Come on, Peter. Get up, Hazel. Suzanne? Get your slippers on. Suzanne? Get your slippers on. Hey, Suzanne. OK They're already on. Oh, you little devil! Suzanne's going to be the first one in for breakfast. MARIANNE: Suzanne. Suzanne, what were you doing? Come on, eat your-- Come on. Come on -Shut up. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Marianne. Look. Marianne. Well, we haven't got all day. [ALARM] I have some extra work for you tonight. But I've got to be home to make supper. I called Raymond. It's been arranged. Relax. You wanted to talk to me? Maybe I was too rash. Maybe I'm the one that pushed a little too much. What I'm trying to say is that I want you back. What for? I want you to come back, take care of the girls. Forget it. I know you've been hanging around with Rocky, and I know exactly what you've been doing. Dan, why do you want me to come back? I want you back because I love you, and I need you here. You're a joke, you know that? You're a real joke. Harold's here with a chick. -What's your name? -Marianne. Marianne, I'd like you meet a friend of mine, Cindy [INAUDIBLE]. This is Joe [INAUDIBLE]. Joe's an old client of mine. Joe's always got his eyes open for new talent. Cindy. If you change your mind, you're let me know. Sure. Marianne. Marianne. Marianne, I would like to invite you to a little party, some friends and I are having. I know you just finished work and want to fix up a little bit. I'm sure the girls will find you something to wear. [INAUDIBLE], show her around. -OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. You can get out. OK, get into my car over here. Quick. Get over there! Do you want to know what they have waiting for you? Get over there! You don't move, and you don't follow us. Because if you'll follow us, man, I swear to god I'll ruin you for life. OK? Hell, maybe I'm wrong. Did you want to go up there? -No. I didn't know what was happening. They'd never tell you. That guy back at the house is Dan Campbell. He's like an agent-- supplies the mob, entertainers, politicians. He [INAUDIBLE] Are you a friend of his? I used to be. Rita says she can't work tonight. Says she's got a cold. Listen, baby, you've got to get out of here. I can't get out. Cindy's already said she'd help as soon as you're ready. I can help myself. Rita, wake up. Would you get off my back? It's going to be difficult the few weeks. I've got my eyes on some new clubs. You and I and the girls have to be working very hard. I don't want any of the girls leaving while this is going on. I'll make sure Rita shows up. CINDY: What's your name again? MARIANNE: Marianne. Why? I don't know. It was like I had to. CINDY: What do you mean, you had to? Let that slimy mother put his paws all over you? Nobody has to do that shit, kiddo. Nobody does. If I didn't, there'd be all kinds of trouble. Not even that. Things were OK. I had a job. -So what? There are millions of jobs around. If I didn't have that job, daddy [INAUDIBLE] would kick me out. I couldn't leave the kids. They need me. Cindy, it doesn't really matter, as long as you're with the people who need you, and [INAUDIBLE]. That's it. You know, it's funny. For a moment there I was thinking you were a dumb chick. Now I'm beginning to think, maybe I'm the dumb one. Hey, Rita. You're working tonight. Fuck off. Oh, a real tough guy, huh? Can't you see I'm sick? Sorry, it's a private party. --[INAUDIBLE] that guy [INAUDIBLE]. Where a rain coat. They don't call him [INAUDIBLE] for nothing. --[INAUDIBLE] one thing John out there. I know. It's [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] crazy. I wonder what he's up to. How are the girls, huh? The girls are OK, except for Rita. I'm going to match you up with that guy [INAUDIBLE]. But I don't think she'll [INAUDIBLE]. I think it's time we get rid of her. I'm sorry, you know, I didn't mean to get so uptight at you back there. But, yeah, I used to work for Campbell. I used to work for him. [INAUDIBLE] wasn't so bad. It was ticket out of the slums. [INAUDIBLE] those chicks who got their pussy like Fort Knox, they don't know what it's like. They can afford to. And, you know, got nothing in front of you but a job in a factory or get knocked up. I just think it was a square deal. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Jesus, was I dumb. CINDY: Tell me. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Right after I started working for Dan he put me in charge of the girls. DAN: You got the money? CINDY: Uh huh. CINDY (VOICEOVER): We became lovers. DAN: [INAUDIBLE] going to have a new dress for Monday night. CINDY (VOICEOVER): We were the most expensive girls in town. In the beginning he gave us everything we wanted. [KNOCKING] Who is it? [KNOCKING] Who is it? CINDY (VOICEOVER): Rita was my best friend. But when she started doing heroin, Rita broke my heart. What's for dinner, more tie-dyed t-shirts and [INAUDIBLE]? Oh, shove it, [INAUDIBLE]. You won't get to [INAUDIBLE]. Ooh, wow. Wow. -Here. Bartender. Bartender! CINDY (VOICEOVER): Annie was the youngest. She was like my kid sister. Will you marry me? -I don't know. -Pick me. Pick me! Pick me. What do you say? Marry me and I'll make you a baby. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Rosemary's a real card. Penny was there with her sister. Diane was a tough kid. Everything always seemed to go wrong for her. And Heather, she was the quiet one. Six. CINDY (VOICEOVER): They were the only real family I ever had. So when Dan started getting heavy, I had to stick up for them. Let them go for a few days. They're tired. I'm tired, Cindy. Listen, baby, there's work to do. One day he decided to make an example of Annie. What are you doing here? Start walking. Listen, a guy was, uh-- was trying to get his kicks out of punching Annie so I-- I talked her into staying here and talking to you. I really don't think she likes working for you, you know? Annie, come here. You were going to quit? Well I didn't come here to get beat up. [SCREAM] -My leg! My leg! CINDY (VOICEOVER): I tried to help her out of town, and she was found dead a week later. I had a feeling I was next. [MUSIC PLAYING] We [INAUDIBLE]. They're heavy in the French underworld, and [INAUDIBLE] Marcy. I went to her for help. Campbell's after me. Yeah. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Rocky likes me, so he let me stay with him until Dan cooled down. You've heard? ROCKY: Yes. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Dan hates Rocky because Rocky's where Dan wants to be. He used to keep in touch with Annie. She's dead, and he killed her. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Her sister was found dead last week and she fell to pieces. That's why when I saw you at Dan's I, couldn't let it happen to you. [INAUDIBLE], she's next. Listen to me. We're going to do something soon, I promise. [INAUDIBLE] OK, [INAUDIBLE]? OK. CINDY: Now I look back on it and I say, when your pussy goes for money, something else goes too. Go right down the hall. Last door on the right, there's a chick named Rita waiting for you. Have a good time. For god sake's, Margo, stay out the corners, giggling with the other girls. Jones can't stand that kind of stuff. Now you take that one. Ever been to the [INAUDIBLE]? God no. [INAUDIBLE] there? [INAUDIBLE]. Hey, Marianne. It's past your bed time, ain't it? [INAUDIBLE] Do you studs want to have a game. Sorry, we'd like to lady, but we got a rule. We only play for money. The money is [INAUDIBLE]. What do you say, ten bucks? All we've got is four. What are you drunk or something? Dan told me [INAUDIBLE]. Mindy wants me. Fuck want Mindy wants. I'm going to go talk to Dan. You start that shit again and your head comes off. DAN: What the hell has she done with [INAUDIBLE]? Get her to work. Hey! What the fuck? My dress! Hey, wait a minute. Let me take my dress off. Oh, fucking shit! I just found out that Cindy [INAUDIBLE] that new chick. You take care of Rita and meet me back at the house. What do you think you're doing? Look, Dan told me to take her home. What about my dress? You've got to pay for it! Getting that dress off is your job, sister. What is it? I don't know. [INAUDIBLE] Want to have a party? American graffiti. Sure, friend, let me know when they throw you [INAUDIBLE]. Quick, cut in front. Hey, what the fuck do you think you're doing? Listen, chicks, it's Friday night. We're going to have some fun. Uncle Bob don't take no for an answer. Don't take no for an answer, eh? Want to have some fun? Sure. Let's have some fun. Go get your friend [INAUDIBLE] to come with us. All right. OK, it's in the bag. Listen, these are typical douchebags. They like cruising too, man. We're just going to lay out on the line. OK. You chicks from [INAUDIBLE]? -Nope. This here's Ernie. And I'm Bob. Nice to meet you. Where are we going? Somewhere quiet, where we can have some fun. CINDY: So. OK, you come up front, and I'll hope in the back with, uh, Uncle Bob. How's that? Take your pants off. MARIANNE: I like to be talked to first. OK. -Well, um what's your name? -Marianne. [INAUDIBLE]. I don't know what to say. MARIANNE: Well, what's your name? Ernie. Ernie Kessler. Holy shit. CINDY: Tell your friend to drop his pant. Come on. Do as she says, god damn it. CINDY: That's it. OK. Now get out of the car. OK? That's it. So you really think you can pick up two chicks as scare 'em into it? Have a bit more respect next time, OK? Hmm? Yeah. I-- I guess so. CINDY: [INAUDIBLE]. Go next to your friend. Gather their things. That knife really scared me, you know? Ah, that wasn't dangerous. You'll be able to size men up, you know. Guys like that are just blowhards. Hey, you got a boyfriend? Yeah, sure. What's he like? Well, he's very nice. He likes to sit and talk for hours. I don't really have a boyfriend. I never really did. That's crazy. Yeah, we'll have to get you one. CINDY: Peter? Want a beer? -Yep. What are you? Some kind of a cock-tease? Oh, no one's ever called me that before. What about-- Marianne. What about her? She's cool. Nice to meet you. Dan was recruiting and it's one of his new girls so I had to help her out, right? -That must be why he called you. -What? He called here about half and hour ago. He said he wanted to talk to you. I called Tom [INAUDIBLE] in New York. He's sending up a couple of his people [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] We don't have to take nobody's shit. She's already asleep. Dan's not going to sit down for this. I know. Rocky [INAUDIBLE] invited us up to lake tomorrow. He'll help us. And how are you? Rita? Rita? You know, your friend there, she's heading for trouble. Well she's been waiting for a long time to help those girls. You're a man. Put some sense into her head. You know I can't tell her a thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] Cindy, I don't like the way Campbell handles his business any more than you do. But if I pick a fight with him, it's going to be heavy. So, there's got to be a reason. And this thing with Marianne-- no offense, honey-- that's no reason. There's nothing I can do. -Is Marianne with her? -No. That's too bad. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? CINDY: Hello, it's Cindy. It's Peter there? -No. He went to spend a few hours working in the boat. CINDY: Shit. Is something wrong? CINDY: I just saw Eddy. I'm going to disappear [INAUDIBLE] I'll call you later. Bye. Hi, Eddy. -Hello, Cindy. -[INAUDIBLE]. [SCREAMING] Stop! [SCREAMING] Look. Lighten up, bitch. Fuck you! It's funny, I guess I must of thought it was a game. That nothing serious would happen. But it's for real. Come on. Your bath is ready. [INAUDIBLE]. I'm going to start picking up the girls. I know it's not completely worked out but I-- I feel I have to-- now. [INAUDIBLE]. I don't really remember much about it, but-- well, I'll do anything you want me to, Cindy. CINDY: That's Graham's house. We met him after Annie's funeral. We can stay here [INAUDIBLE]. Wow. Peter, Marianne, this is Graham. -What are you, chicken? -Come on, honey. If he finds me he'll cut to pieces. [INAUDIBLE] end up like Rita. I can still do Johns. -What? -Sorry. I had a bad week. You're full of shit. Yeah, well speaking of Rita, she split and it took Dan about one week to get her back. Dan didn't get her back. Rita ran out of junk money and she came running. Oh yeah, well what are we supposed to do? Live off Cindy for the rest of our lives? No. We're going to get some bread together. We're going to go off somewhere where Dan can't find us. And we'll just-- we'll stay until he gives up. Oh yeah, it's wonderful. We'll hold up in some [INAUDIBLE] somewhere, turning in coke bottles for the rest of our days. It's only for a little while. And then what? I can't do nothing, honey. I wouldn't-- wouldn't [INAUDIBLE] back in Montreal. Dan doesn't give a shit about us anymore. If we sit around, we're going right down the tube with Rita. We've got to try it. Ah, shit. I don't know. You'd think she'd be on time for once. Ah, there she is. Grab these. What the hell are you doing? What the hell do you think? Pretending [INAUDIBLE]. [CAR HORN] Rosemary, this is Graham. Holy shit. What happened to the rest of it? [CAR HORN] Don't worry. She'll calm down. As soon as she gets used to the place. [CAR HORN] God, I hope it can happen. We checked all their hangouts, but nobody's seen 'em. I don't like it. Well what do you want? I just want to be smart. But you can't always be smart. Sometimes you have to do things you feel. Cindy, I don't like your plan because it separates us. It's you not being happy living here with me. No it's not. It's just something I have to do. Yeah, well that's what so sad. Such a strong drive in you-- all the pleading and bullshitting from an intellectual like myself isn't going to even matter. [KNOCKING] Marianne. She was supposed to be at Graham's. [INAUDIBLE]. She ain't here, Dan. Where's the girl? Like that man said, she ain't here. Take him out to the car. OK, let's go. You're going to get him back when we get the girl. Shit. I got to watch you all night. I'll tell ya something. I wouldn't try anything if I were you, because I'd beat the shit out of you just for something to do. You can't leave tomorrow. Oh, come on. I was next. Cindy says, blow off tomorrow. If Cindy says wait, we wait. CINDY: Well, I guess I have no alternative. If you won't back me up then give me a piece. Cindy, you don't want that. Are you going to give me a piece or another story? It's only for muscle. I've made up my mind. If you won't help me I'll go somewhere else. I hope I don't have to regret this one. Thanks. What do you do? I'm a writer. I write articles. You know, tap, tap, tap, tap. Where's Cindy? At home I guess. Why don't you tell me where Rose Marie is. Got me. You writers, try to be so convincing. Sometimes it works, but only in books. What you're looking at, and what I'm all about is money, and it's hard to come by. An I don't fuck-ups. I've got an idea. Why don't you beat me up. No. I might have you killed. [GUNSHOT] CINDY: How does it feel? I'll get used to it. The trick, you see, is not to be intimidated by the gun. If you're ready and willing to use it, you won't have to. So make your moves very definite. Cause if he thinks you're afraid, you're in trouble. [GUNSHOTS] Dan and Johnny Silver are like this, OK. Dan [INAUDIBLE] into Montreal, shows 'em around, gives 'em a good time. I'd do this, Marianne, but he knows me. [INAUDIBLE] Then sends a car to pick him up at around 6:30. MARIANNE: OK. You got to go. You're going to be all right. Mr. Silver, may I have your autograph please? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to. -Mr. Silver, may I have a kiss? -[INAUDIBLE]. CINDY: OK. There's a gun in your ribs. OK? Now go ahead. JOHNNY SILVER: Rudy, take us [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] to the show. You have 20 minutes until makeup. Fuck the makeup, Rudy. Just do what I tell ya. OK, you're the boss. CINDY: Like I said, Dan. When I get Peter, you get Silver back. Sam, get that kid. Eddy, come here. OK, now, tell the driver to take a 20-minute walk. Rudy, would you mind splitting for about 20 minutes? No, I don't mind. Thanks for the lift. Where is he? I see him. Over there. Why are all these damn people in the street? [CAR HORN] Hey, where is he? I knew I'd find you here. Did I do some things smart for a change? Oh yeah. Yeah. Come on. Let's get out of here. Do you have any idea what he does for the girls? Sure, provides the fucking jones. ROCKY: No, you're wrong. He takes care of them. That's something they can't do for themselves. They pay a price for it, but that's what they want. Where do you get off telling me that crap? Sure it's a trade-off. Sure they're sheep. But that's not the point. The point is that Dan's gone berserk. He's not going by the rules. In any other city the mob would shoot him down. OK, I'll send two of my men over that place. But don't go back to your apartment. Campbell's through being nice to you. OK. Thanks. DAN: How's it going, Heather? -Fine. Remember when you first started to work for me? Your sister was in some kind of trouble. You needed some money. I guess. I know with that money she's going to school. Mm hm. Rosemary's gone. And I know someone helped her? Do you know who helped her? No. It would mean some extra money for you and your sister. If, uh, you were know anything. Heather, look at me. There's no sense in kidding now. Sooner or later I'm going to find Rosemary. I'm going to find anyone else who tries to split. You'd be doing yourself and the girls a big favor, if you would just happen to hear or see anything. OK. You better run along now. You've got some work to do. DAN: Heather, remember, no one has to know. [MUSIC PLAYING] Graham, why are you staring at me? GRAHAM: Because you're beautiful. OK, Diane, you're on for tomorrow, Victoria Square. Holy shit, I can't believe it. He's going to find out, Diane. I know it. Ah, fuck off. When did she leave? Sometime this morning. [DOORBELL] Dan. Dan. Yeah, what? Those guys from New York, they're here, outside. What? Here, outside. That's prefect timing. Send 'em in. Are you Tony? -Yeah, Tony [INAUDIBLE]. This is Sal [INAUDIBLE]. DAN: Hey, Sal. Tom [INAUDIBLE] has told me a lot about you guys. Yeah, we did some work for Tom [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, you were up there last year. You did that [INAUDIBLE] remember? Yeah, that was us. How'd you do it? Well we set it up by-- Yeah, you wouldn't like it, in six months we was talking about this job. No. You're absolutely right, Sal. Sit down. I'm going to give you a run-down. What makes you think they're down here? Well I suppose they fell through the hole. I can't find any of my stuff in this crazy place. And if I go crazy around here, Graham, I'm blaming you. Hey, Rose, you folks want to eat? ROSE: Yeah. I'll be up in a minute. OK. GRAHAM: Oh. Were they sort of pink with green lace and a rose on the side? Yeah. Well, I found them. They were on the floor of the bathroom. Well thank god somebody's got their chips together around here, even if it's only you Graham. Rosemary connected with her friend in [INAUDIBLE]. And she's going to be leaving in two days. Well that explains her terrific mood. [PHONE RINGING] Hi? Cindy, it's for you. CINDY: OK. Hello? Yeah? Where? OK. Be right there. Bye bye. I wish Rocky would let us [INAUDIBLE] this [INAUDIBLE] from the inside. -Hey, want me to a strip number? -Sure. -Is everything all right? -Yeah. Tell you what you need, you need a good man. That's what you need. I feel funny. [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] boyfriend. [INAUDIBLE]. Are you going to tell me you never thought about him? I haven't. Hey, Margo and I have an act we do together. Do you want to see it? Yeah. OK. We have to go in the next room and get ready. Be back in a minute. No peeking. These Canadian broads are real hot numbers. Yeah, real friendly Can I have the French one after you? Here they come. What the hell is this? Is this the way you people operate up here? You know, the one I really used to hate-- like really hate is the one that when they used to say, you remind me of. You know? That one, you remind me of. You remind me of my girlfriend. Right. Of my wife. Of my grandmother, my toad. The one I love is when the guy says, I want you to give me a blowjob [INAUDIBLE]. How about the, I love your soul rap? He knows you for about five minutes and he's in love with your soul. Well I think it's also wonderful with all those cute little, you know what [INAUDIBLE]. Oh yeah. Sorry, the party's getting dirty. Graham, you're going to make somebody a great old man. -That's true. -You know that? I'm going to miss you when I go. [DOORBELL] -He's upstairs. -OK. JOAN: Heather. Joan! Hi! Hi. Oh, you look wonderful. Bet you're wondering what I'm doing here. I got a call from your boss, Mr. Campbell. He thought it would be a great idea for me to come and visit you. He sent the money and everything. He even said there might be a job, that maybe I could work this summer. Oh, Heather, wouldn't it be wonderful? The summer in Montreal? HEATHER: OK. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Where? All right. We'll be there. It's Heather. She's ready. She couldn't have picked a street with a bit more traffic, eh? I'm getting the creeps. -[INAUDIBLE]. There she is. How come you went on the corner? Cause I was scared. Oh, you were scared to go around the corner. That's bright. Is there anything the matter, Heather? No. I'm just nervous. I love these out of town gigs. Babes, they're don't nothing. OK, guys. Let's go. Hey, what's this? Tonight, Eddy my boy, we're going to show you how we do things in the Big Apple. Hi, Heather. Hi, Nicole. You want some win No thanks. I'm tired. She needs a bit of rest. Come on, I'll show you where to lie down. -Something's rotten in Denmark. -Yep. I'll try and talk to her later. You want me to stay around for a few days? Help you out or something? Uh uh. You're the first one out. We don't need that. Let's go for a drive, eh? What's going on? Something's happening, and I don't know what. We're going to go see Rocky. Hello, Henry. Who are your friends? The customers. Eddy! Eddy! Listen, Rocky, I don't have to fucking discuss it, man. We got to move them, do you understand? Fast. The guy's out of town for a few months. CINDY: This'll do fine. Peter, get things ready. I'll go get the girls. OK? -OK. Hey, you got a light? -From New York? -Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]. -You don't say. -Yeah. You ever seen one of these before? You want to dance? No, I don't feel like it. Come on. Come on and dance. I'm going to go get some more wine. Well, girls. God damn pigs! [GUNSHOTS] Take a good luck, girls. Next time we play for keeps. CINDY: Rosemary? Graham? Cindy! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] OK. You learned your lesson now? Let's go home. Come on. DAN: You look like a picture. How is she? She's OK. ROCKY: I guess this place is as good as any to wait him out. I can't afford any more screw-ups. Here's some pills to keep her calm. The longer she stays in bed the better. Understand? Four guys, for the day after tomorrow. Listen, I know they're expensive. Good. My friend, we're in business. ROCKY: I don't care what the word is. If you're still sitting on the fence when this thing blows, you're going to be picking splinters out of your ass. I don't want to tell a guy how to run his business but why we waiting until tomorrow? I think we ought to go in there and bust ass, tonight. CINDY: Tony? Hmm? How many people are dead? TONY: Marianne, and two of Rocky's men. Anthony? [INAUDIBLE]? No one's heard from them. It's not your fault. CINDY: Whose fault is it then? Look, I know you, and I know that look. And this time there's nothing you can do. It's over. It's finished. Rocky's handling it. I was stupid. I was sure I knew Dan. It's not over. Will you wake up? Aren't you trying to put me to sleep? Look, four people are dead. I thought it wasn't my fault? [INAUDIBLE], baby. You never listen to me anyway. That's good. No deal. Wait, let me cut 'em. Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]. Eddy. Eddy, wake up. You all right? TV:She's want's it fancier. I don't know, some Eskimos. We took all the candles too. So we just have to wait for the [INAUDIBLE]. How can we wait? How about the bread? $0.24 a loaf. And they said they're going to take all we make. Then we've got to make bread, lots of bread. Sure. But you got to have to wood to burn if you're going to make bread. You can't make bread if you're out chopping wood. You can't mix it. You'll get used to it. That's just it. She's not here. Shit. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? I'll see if he can talk. It's Cindy. EDDY: You any hardware, Cindy? CINDY: No. EDDY: Let's make sure. Come here. Sit down. It's nice to see you again. What can I do for you? I thought a lot about what happened. I know you want to apologize. Well, I-- I want to come back. DAN: Come back? I'd thought you'd never ever were going to work for me again? I thought you never wanted to be associated with vile people like myself? What is it? You want to touch me? You want to make love to me? I've given it a lot of thought. I was wrong. I shouldn't of interfered. I think you should go out in the street and sell your ass like a two-bit whore. But you know that's not what I want. No, it's you I want. Whatever you what. You're a fucking liar. You expect me to believe that? I'm not expecting, I'm hoping. DAN: Cindy, why do you do this to us? Why do you pretend you're so strong, when all you want is someone to take care of you? You know what you're doing? -Yes. That's what I always liked about you, Cindy. You always thought you knew what you were doing. Are you going to shoot me? -Yeah. DAN: If I weren't going to kill you now, I would take you back. [SCREAM]
