[train whistle blowing] [car horn honking] Each of you must decide for yourself if this deal can fly. You've read it, you've taken a hard look at it. I invite you now to pick it apart. Weigh your risk tolerance against my past performance. That's all I ask. We've been together 14 years, let's not blow it now. Africa offers us a wealth of opportunities. Africa is the richest continent on the face of the earth in natural resources. Why are we not players? The center, that's where the power is. The game is played from the center out. Out, that's where we are. On the edges. In the shadows. Can I guarantee the outcome? No. I personally believe that the upside can be huge. For me, the scope of this is scary. What the hell do I know about import export? How come I can't get it out of my head that community investors should, for the most part be investing in community projects? Look... You know my position. The money game is the biggest game there is. And I aim to put us right in the middle of it. We gotta learn the money game. Better, and better, and better. [police siren] [children shouting] What do you want to do later? I don't know. Miss thing owes me some money. I'm tired of this shit. I got to get my nails done. Oh, shit, yo, there goes Rhonda. I'm gonna go see what's up with her. Yo, Rhonda, what's up? Yo, you can't say hi no more? You're too good for us now? Hi. Now get out of the way, Crystal. What's your fucking hurry? I got to get to work. No, no, no. What you got, bitch, is your head up in your ass. You know what I'm saying? What's this bougie shit you got, yo? - Hey, give it back! - What's up with that, you stupid bitch? Fuck you, stupid slut. Fuck you! - What? - Fucking cunt. Who the fuck do you think you are? Yo, yo! Chill! Chill! Rhonda, go on. Get out of here. Crystal, back up. What? You think you all that because you wear that dress? She acts like we don't fucking exist no more! Shit! Stupid ass bitch. She ain't the only one going places. Crystal, where the hell we going? Won't be staying in Eden the rest of our life. [laughing] Hey, baby. Going out? Mm-hmm. Got a date. With Danny? I thought he was history. He is. This is somebody new. Nicole, I don't want to fight. I can handle it. This new guy seems very nice. Yeah, that's what you said about Danny. - Nicole-- - Until he started beating the crap out of you. I don't want to talk about it. Why do you stand for it? I don't know! I just know I could use a little bit of niceness from you. Okay? [sighs] Wish me a good time. I wish you a good time, Mom. Don't even say a word. - Oh, no. - Don't even say a-- I know you love it. I know you jealous. You've got to tell Fast Freddy to let me hook you up with some new gear, girl. That shit looks wack! I got to wear it if I want to get paid. Thanks for the ride, Boo. - Listen. - Oh, no. I gotta go. - No, no, no, no. - Lewis, I'm late. Listen to me, baby. Look into my eyes, all right? Right? You're my girl, right? Yeah. And I want you to be my woman. I am your woman. No, no, no. You know what I'm talking about. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, give me a kiss. Bye. Ooh, Nicole. Gonna tell mama. You late, girl. Freddy, I'm sorry, but-- Sorry don't get it, baby. You be on time next time. Hey, what's happening, y'all? Everything okay? What, you want some crab juice, baby? Gary, we need more fries. Why don't you make your own fries? Thank you. Freddy: Hey, lookie here. Oh, no, no. We don't serve pig feet here. ♪ [funk] Hey! How many times I got to tell you, boy? Turn the music down. Aw, man, I don't know, Freddy. You gotta like, raise the roof, you know? Oh, man, we gonna raise the roof. Raise the roof. - Aw, man. - Hey, y'all closing by yourself, okay? All right? Can I help you? Yeah, man. You know what the deal is, though? I kinda really ain't in the mood for a burger. So how about this. Why don't you just open up the fucking register right now? I'm serious! Open that shit. Give me the money. Now! Hey, yo, yo, what's up? What's happening, man? [gunshots] [panting] Oh, my sweet Jesus. Who are we? What do we stand for? What can we give our children? In finding the answer to these questions, we find the answer to how we best memorialize Fred Shepherd. Freddy's death will not have been in vain if we, each and every one of us, reach deep down inside to that fire that burns in all of us and use it to light the way to making our lives better... from this day forward. This is our community. These are our streets. This is our world. And this is where we have to stand firm on our own behalf. This is where we have to seize fate, shake its tail and bend it to our will. This is where we must make every day count. And in doing so, we honor the best in ourselves. And when we honor the best in ourselves, we will honor the best in all the Freddy Shepherds we have lost. Ow! How do you feel? How do you expect me to feel? You want to talk about it some more? No. Yeah, well... What's this world coming to? Fast Freddy dead. Gary dead. Oh. Do me a favor, honey, make some coffee. Water's on the stove. Thanks, baby. Oh, Jesus. My head hurts. It seems like it's getting harder and harder to wake up. It's called a hangover. What's going to happen with your job? Hmm? I don't know. Why? Why? You know why. Honey, with all the cutbacks at the hospital. I'm only on three times a week, now. And we can't live on just my check. Yeah, okay. [siren] About 18 to 25, I guess. Black. That's half of south Brooklyn. I know I asked you yesterday, but can you be more specific? I know you're scared. He had on, like, a black jacket with a black cap. He had weird eyes. He was like, you know, fucked up on something. High. If you remember anything, anything at all, call us. It was your dad's sweat and determination that made it happen. If you need anything, let me know. Okay. - You work here? - Yep. Got any work? No, no, we're not looking for anybody right now. But you could check back. - Nothing? - No, I'm sorry. I mean, come on. You've got all these people. - Nothing? - No, no, but, you know, check back. - All right. - Okay. Good luck to you. You didn't complete your application form. Were there some questions you didn't understand? No, I just didn't have time. I'll take another look at it. I tell you what. Why don't you take it with you and bring it back tomorrow? Okay? How'd it go? Okay. Did you find anything? No. I got an application. It's not filled out. - So? - So why not? Because they want a personal statement, and I ain't got nothing to say, that's why. Oh, Nicole, honey, make something up. You don't know how to fill it out, do you? Do you? Do you? I ain't heard you say nothing about no career goals. Yeah, well, I got 'em. Oh, yeah? I got 'em too, ma. It's not to be like you. [gasps] Oh, baby. Vickie, I'm sorry! Honey, I-- I can't get another job. Not anywhere. Even Kentucky Fried has a waiting list. I can't get another job because I don't know nothing. Of course you know stuff, baby. I don't know anything anybody would pay me to know. I don't want to end up like-- Like me? Go ahead, say it. Like me? You sound just like your fucking grandmother. [horn blaring] Yes? Is Mr. Cleamons in? Cleamons: Who is it, Ola? I don't know. Hi. Bet you don't remember me, huh? [laughs] You were my teacher. No, I can't say that I do. Sure you do. Come on. How did you get my address? I'm Nicole Turner. I used to work at Fast Freddy's. I called Fred Jr. and he told me how I could reach you. Oh, well, I, uh-- Mr. Cleamons, come on. You don't remember me? 3rd Grade at Washington. Nicole Turner. - No, Miss-- - Nicole Turner. I don't. - Now I have something to-- - I know. I know. You've got work to do, and I don't mean to take up your time. Yes, well, it's nice meeting you, and, uh... Goodbye. I quit high school, Mr. Cleamons. I didn't learn nothing. I don't know nothing. Miss, you're blocking my door. I heard you speak at the funeral the other day. I want to make my life mean something, Mr. Cleamons. I want to learn. Well, good for you, but this clearly has nothing to do with me. I want you to help me. I want you to teach me things. - You what? - Teach me things. Like what you said about honoring Mr. Freddy. I want to know stuff. Well-- Look, miss, the fact of the matter is, I am no longer a teacher, and I haven't been for a number of years. Will, what's going on? We have to get going. Won't be a minute, Wendy. Won't be a minute. You'll have to excuse me now. You just going to dis me like that? Man, I thought that speech meant something, but I guess it was nothing but words. Look... if you want to continue this discussion, you'll call me at my office. Five or six people still have their doubts? And as for outright resistance, two, maybe three, you say? What the hell is wrong? Why don't they get it? Hey, they're bright, intelligent, successful people, Will. Self-made, every one of them. Just like you. They get it. So what do you say? That I'm the one not getting something? - Is that it? - Damn right. I mean, you've traded in your compassion for-- Oh, bullshit. I've not changed. Bullshit! I've watched you, step by step. You think I think life's all about money. - Yes. - I don't. I think it's mostly about money. Well, what about ethics? And morals? Take money out of the mix, the world stops dead, and so does ethics and morals. You're looking at life through different eyes. We've crossed a lot of rivers together, Joe, but I won't go back to where you think I might have made a wrong move and fix anything. Try. You might surprise yourself. There are no surprises back there. No, no surprises. Just a lot of unfinished business waiting to be settled. Like your ex-wife, Desiree. You've never even talked to her. My past life is my concern. Stay the hell out of it, Joe. I'm here to see Mr. Cleamons. One moment. Conditioning. It's holding you too close to home. We've got to break loose. And what about those who can't keep up? They're going to get left behind. You've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet, Joe. And don't give me that look. I know exactly how it sounds. And exactly what I'm saying. Yeah, money talks. The ends justify the means. And if it comes to it, you're even willing to break me to make your omelet. That's what you're saying. Tell him I'm here. I'm sorry, but if you don't have an appointment-- He knows me. Trust me. No, no, no, I'm afraid you'll have to leave. - Hey! - Oh, shit. Who's that? It's nobody. Sorry, Mr. Cleamons, I thought she was a messenger. It's all right, Johnnie. She's here to see me. [clears throat] How long have you been standing out here? I didn't want to disturb you while you were talking. You said to talk to you at your office. I said call me at my office. Oh. This is an old friend of mine, George Sherman. - Sherman this is-- - Nicole Turner. Nicole. She worked for Fast Freddy. Y'all work here with all these white folks? Don't they make you nervous? No, on the contrary. I think sometimes Mr. Cleamons makes them nervous. Yeah, makes them feel like they gotta watch what they say, right? That's probably why they got you cooped up in this fancy office. And I always thought it was because I'm a senior partner. Okay, Nicole, where were we? It's like I told you, Mr. Cleamons. I want to know things. What do you think about giving me some lessons? Like I told you, Nicole, I ain't no teacher anymore. Yeah, but, Mr. Cleamons, I'm stuck. And being stuck just ain't no good. No, being stuck just ain't no good. Where do you live, Nicole? Brooklyn. In the Eden Garden housing complex. - Been there long? - All my life. My grandma lived there till she got enough money to move, 'cause she and my mom, they don't get along. They don't talk no more. What about your father? Nah, just me and my mom live there right now. You know about Eden? Yeah, I know about Eden. Hey, nice to meet you. Yeah. Would you excuse us for a minute? She wants to learn and you say she's hopeless? That's the way it is. Look, we'll pick up where we left off later. Why can't you tutor her, Will? Oh, for Christ's sakes, Joe. With the years of education missing there, the gap's too wide for tutoring to fill. The odds are against it. Believe me. Major, major effort, that. Yeah, about as major as me convincing the others to get on board and ride with you into this new megadeal you've got in mind. I'll be willing to give it my best shot. Best shot for best shot? So? How 'bout it, Mr. Cleamons? I will try to teach you. Yeah? But it'll cost you. Cost me? How much? - $10 an hour. - $10 an hour? Aw, man. Consider it an investment in your future. Okay. Okay. Then we start on Saturday, about 10 A.M., sharp. I believe you know where I live. All right. - Good morning. - Hey, how you doing? Fine, thank you. Sure is a big place. You live here all alone? Yes, Nicole, I do. Yeah? You don't got a wife, or nothing? No, I don't have a wife, or anything. What is this? Your own personal library? You got a librarian, too? This is my sanctuary, Nicole. Do you know what the word visualize means? Sort of. Well, think of something important that's happened to you. A special event, say. Okay? Can you see it? Yeah. Sure, it's like a picture in my mind. The mind is used for many things and one of the most important is to visualize and store information as images. That's how we learn. Okay, now I'll take you back and we'll start at the beginning. What beginning? Before you were born. Before I was born. Before the earth was formed. Before the solar system was created. Before the galaxies and the universe were born. That beginning. Do you know what it was called? No. The big bang. How long ago was that? 15, 18 billion years. Shit. That's a long time ago. Yes. We will visualize what science says happened from that moment on up to the moment you came into this life. One of the most powerful pieces of information you can own is a sense of history-- history of the universe as a whole, the galaxies within it, of the solar system within our milky way galaxy, of planet Earth in that solar system, of the nations on that planet, of the people in those nations, your people from Africa to America to this glorious state to this troubled city to the very place where you were born. That beginning. Wow. You don't need much breath to talk, huh? Know whence you came, Nicole. For if you know whence you came, there's really no limit to where you can go. Hey, Mr. Cleamons. Good morning. What are we going to do today? You like asking questions, don't you? Do you ever wonder if? If what? Do you ever wonder why? Why what? Do you ever wonder how? How what? This is a lesson, right? Do you ever wonder where? I don't get it. What do you wonder about, Nicole? I don't know. Not much, I guess. Bad answer. I dub thee from this day forward a thinking individual. Hey, hey! You're messing up my hair! I just had my do did. Your "do did?" You mean you've just had your hair done. Yeah. And after it's done, it's did, right? I just had my do did. The book on your head is so that learning stays on your mind. And in the process it will help to improve your posture. Posture, that's the first word I want you to look up. You slouch. Hey, I ain't no slouch! I didn't say you were a slouch, I said you do slouch. Your grammar is horrible. Can you tell me what a noun, a verb, a pronoun, and an adjective all are? No. But you're going to teach me, right? No, you're going to teach yourself. Look those things up in your new dictionary. As a thinking individual, you should constantly be wondering, constantly be asking questions. What should I wonder about? Everything. [no audible dialogue] [bell ringing] Yo, Merry Christmas. Lewis, you gotta read some of this. - I got some sandwiches. - This is unbelievable. - I got some sodas. - Mr. Cleamons gave me this book. Will you just read this one part? - Come on. - I'm telling you, you would love it. - Lewis! - Tell me about it on the way. There you are, my lady. Pure, authentic Louisiana jambalaya made from... I'll give you one minute to give me an answer as to how many books there are in here. It'll take me a lot longer than a minute to count all these books. Then I guess you'll have to figure out a better way to get an answer than by counting the books one by one. Like how? I don't get it. Of course you don't. Because you are not thinking. Consider this a test. Begin. I'm not finished yet. Then, my dear, you'll have to make an educated guess. If I was going to guess, I wouldn't have counted in the first place. Then you'd be wearing your ignorance on your sleeve. Always arm yourself with as much information as possible. But you didn't give me enough time. Nicole, sometimes in life there just isn't enough time, and at those times, you must guess. And in this instance, you must guess because you weren't quick enough. You might as well attempt to make an educated guess. Understand? - Multiply. - Yes. 2560. Was I close? I don't know. I've never counted. [laughs] Okay, on the count of three, I want you to suck in your gut. - Okay. - One, two, three. Ooh! - Breathe. - Pull! [grunting] - Breathe! - Pull! Okay, okay. - Oh, God. - You got it. - Up. - Woo! Okay. I can't breathe, but my ass looks good. [laughs] Damn, girl. I was beginning to think you weren't going to be hanging out with us. I thought you were dissing us, being that your nose was all up in them books and whatnot. I missed you. I missed you, too. We're going to party tonight, though. Yeah! ♪ I miss you, darling, I miss you, darling ♪ ♪ I wish you was with me ♪ 'Cause I need you here... I didn't think you were going to show up tonight. Yeah, I've had a lot of work to do. Aw, shit, baby, I've got a surprise for you. What? My brother, he's out of town. We got the whole place to ourselves. What's up? You up for a little private study hall? Uh, yeah. What's up, kid? Who we got here? Taurus, this is Nicole. Nicole, this is Taurus. How you doing? Hi, how you doing? You know, man, you know. I'm doing everything. Yo, check it out, you know. You get tired of my man Lewis, you just come and see me, 'aight? Just playing, man. Yeah. [rapping continues] [laughing] Sorry, homie, man. Who the fuck you calling homie, man? - Huh? - Punk! You don't know me, punk! [grunts] I'll kill you, motherfucker! Let me put it clear! Come here, bitch. Let's get out of here. Lewis, how well you know Taurus? - Taurus? - Yeah. What do you want to know about him for? - Especially now? - I just do. How well you know him? Farrell knows him. He says he knows him from the old days. They used to hang together sometimes. Lewis, I've got stuff on my mind. Look, listen, Nicky, let me put your mind at ease, all right? All we doing is messing around, okay? It ain't no different than nothing we done before. Yes, it is. And look at this place! It's a dump! The light's still on. It ain't romantic! - It's dirty. - You want romantic? [flicking lighter] Yo, Nicky, what the hell is wrong with you, man? Why can't you talk to me? Talk to you? Yeah, talk to me. Can't you see something's bothering me? Hey, man, all right. I'll cut the lights out. It ain't the lights that's the problem! I know, damn it. You the fucking problem. Here. Yeah, girl. Oh. You, come on over here. Mother: Nicole just came in. Shh. [laughing] - Morning. - Good morning. [laughs] What is all this? Take a look. Take a look. Look at all the faces. Carefully. Then I want you to take down the ones that you know. 'Aight. Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods. This cat makes so much money. Ella Fitzgerald, you know? - Nope. - No. I know him. - Martin Luther King. - Yeah. Bob Marley, obviously I know. Bob Marley. Who's this guy? [laughs] Michael Jordan, yes, yes. Um... I don't know them. You should know all of these people. They have all had an impact on your life. Well, I don't. I mean, I know they famous and stuff, but I don't see what they got to do with me. 'Specially these foreign looking people. Before that old man up there died, he ruled over a country in which one fifth of the Earth's people live. That's one in every five persons on the planet. Think about that. And that woman there changed the course of American history simply by refusing to give up her seat on a bus. Okay, what about the rest of them? You tell me. [doorbell ringing] Figure out who you want to tell me about first. I'll be right back. Oh, God. Wendy. The antique auctions at Christie's. That's right, and you forgot. Wendy, I really am sorry. But the thing is-- The thing is-- The thing is you seem to care more about this girl than you do about us. I'd like her to go. Wendy, she's my student. Wendy: No, I want her to go now. This is what killed things between you and Desiree. No wonder your marriage fell apart. You don't know anything about Desiree. Wendy: I know what happened to her. And I know what a giant shadow she cast over-- still casts over your entire life. Hola,Ola. Hi. You finished for the day? Yeah. Mm, these are nice. Mm-hmm. I heard Desiree's beautiful. - She is. - Yeah. It's too bad what happened, though. Yeah, it's a shame. So, you knew her well? Oh, yeah. We went to the same church. - She got married there. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. So do you ever run into her? Child, you don't know, do you? What? She's in jail, honey. She killed her second husband. Mom? Mom? [humming] Ruthie, you ever been in jail? Girl, you know the answer to that. What's wrong with you? Where you getting stuff like that from? Mr. Cleamons? Heh! Nah. Nah, I was just wondering about women in jail. Thought you might know something about it. Yeah, well, I don't. But I do know that it's hell for men, so, it's probably worse for women. Step off the bus. Wait over here. Hi. Do I know you? No. Do you know me? No. So let me ask you, who are you, and why are you here? My name is Nicole Turner, and I came-- You're doing some research on battered women and I'm exhibit A? No, wait. Wait, no! I just-- I just wanna talk. No, I have nothing to say. - Guard! - Please! Look, don't go. I didn't mean to offend you. It's just, I sat on that bus for hours, right? And I got all these questions, like-- That question has already been settled. Like, why did you do it? Why didn't you leave him? Why did you fight back? Guard? How come my mother doesn't, and why did you and Mr. Cleamons split up? Did you say Mr. Cleamons? As in Will Cleamons? You're here because of Will Cleamons? Yeah. No. Yes and no. It's just-- What the hell does Will want? To see if I'm suffering? Well, I'm not. You go back and you tell him I'm okay. You tell him that Desiree is just fine. And fuck him. Fuck Will Cleamons. Make sure you tell him that. He doesn't know I'm here. [buzzer] Fuck. [cocks gun] [gunshot] So... have you decided which one you'll tackle first? Who effected your life the most? Was it one of them? Or was it your wife? How about that? You were married, weren't you? Nicole, spend your time wondering about other things besides me. But I want to wonder about you. Like, why did you and she split up? Because. Because? Because is neither an answer nor is it a complete sentence, nor is it a verb, which is an action word or a noun, which is a person, place or thing. It's not even an adjective, which describes stuff. So there. But it will have to do. Was she the love of your life? Nicole, things change. My life changed. End of conversation. Now if you want something to wonder about, wonder about this. I can't do this. I don't take good tests. It's not a test. It's just information for me, so I'll know what skills you need to concentrate on. Now begin! So? How'd I do? Possess your soul in patience, child. I like that. Possess your soul in patience. I should write that down, huh? We have a lot of work to do. Now, let's finish what we started. Paul Robeson. The idea of my concert is that all men are brothers because of their music. And in my first group, I do an old English song and then I do a Bach Chorale and then I create slight confusion by doing a Negro spiritual right in the middle because it belongs there. And I found that out by going back to Africa, for example. [singing in foreign language] Hey. - Hey, girl. - What's going on? Nicky... I'm late. Late for what? My period. Are you sure? Yeah, pretty sure. Shit. You better go to a doctor. I know. How's work? Same old, same old. You have breakfast? Yeah, I just ate. Why, want me to make you something? Mm-mm. - Oh. - Ruthie! Be careful! Look what you did. Well, I'm sorry. Jeez. Ain't you ever going to find another job? Yeah. Eventually, I'll look for another job. But, it's "aren't" I going to look for another job. Oh, aren't, ain't. Couldn't, can't. Who cares? Eventually ain't gonna keep us off welfare, Nicole. - I know. - Oh, you know. Well, I know you should know to get a job instead of wasting your money on these lessons. Now that's what I know. Look, Ruthie, I paid for these lessons, all right? I saved my money. They're for me. Listen. Something just opened up at the hospital. It's housekeeping nights. You know, cleaning bed pans, making beds, that sort of thing. Now, don't you even try to cut your eyes at me, young lady. Maybe that kind of work is too low class for you now that you've got your head buried in them goddamn books that's costing money you ought to be using to help me keep up this house. Well, this--this job is good enough for me. Do you hear me? I said do you-- I hear you! I hear you. - We need to see you again in two weeks. - Yeah. What did they say? I'm pregnant. It's okay. Come on. Who's that? Don't worry about it. Lewis, what the hell is going on here? Nothing. I don't hear from you. You don't return my calls. Nothing. Fuck that. Maybe if you wasn't so busy with Mr. Cleamons, you would have got some of my messages. [sigh] I can't even talk to you. Fine, then. Fuck you, then. When you want to talk, give me a call. Don't worry about it Yo, I'm not trying to get in the middle of nothing, but it looks like to me that you need a new man. What's up? Thanks for the tip. Hold up, come on. Let me talk to you for a second. What's the matter? I see how you be looking at me, Nicole. When are we gonna hang out? We're not, all right? - Hey, leave me alone. - What? Damn, you a man's woman. See, now, Lewis might have had the glue to catch you, he ain't got the strength to hold you. See, you need a man with some strength. Somebody like me, maybe. - Is that so? - Yeah. Sounds to me like some bullshit. Hey. You like to talk, don't you? Oh, no, no, no. Come here. Come here. Let me tell you something. I'm a whole lot more than talk. Now go on, take your sweet little ass back to Eden. Remember who's who. 'Aight? Now you can go. Go on, get the fuck out of here. Bye, Nicole. Good-bye. Sweetie pie, look at you. Go on home. Bye-bye. See you. Something bothering you, Nicole? You want to talk? Because if you don't want to do the lesson... No. Let's do it. Adolf Hitler. Mr. Cleamons, why didn't somebody smoke his ass when he started that shit? You tell me. Man, that punk was trippin'. He had too much power. And who gave it to him? People did. You know, they knew he was a liar. They knew he was a fake. And they're supposed to do something about it, and they didn't. They didn't. No, they didn't and you've brought us to the word responsibility, - which means-- - I know what it means. Nicole, what's eating you up so much today? Nothing. It's nothing. It's family stuff. Boyfriend stuff, you know. Could we talk about something else? Like what? How about Desiree? Can we talk about her? No. Did you all have children? Why are you so interested in my affairs? Well, you told me to wonder about everything so I wonder what happened to you and Desiree. She left me. Why? Get out of my life! Why do you keep asking questions about her? It is none of your damn business! Understand? Look... the relationship is I teach. I teach and you learn. We may discuss history but not my history. Understand? Yes. Have I made myself clear? Have I made myself clear? - Yeah? - Mrs. Turner? - My name is-- - I know who you are. [baby crying] I wonder if Nicole is here. No, she's not. Do you know where I might find her? Mr. Cleamons. Where is Nicole going to go, hmm? What's she gonna do? I appreciate the time that you're spending with my daughter, but do you have to be filling her head with dreams that I know won't come true? I don't know that. I don't want her to be hurt. She's working at the hospital. Kings County. [sobbing] I'm looking for Nicole Turner. She's right behind you. - Not now. - Sorry, I'll come back. Nicole? We have a lesson today. Well, I blew it off. I see. Well, my time is valuable. You just can't blow off a lesson. Therefore, you owe me. $10. Payable now. I owe you $10? I didn't know you were so hard up for cash. I'm not. I know. But you have a commitment, as have I. That's a part of it. The word is-- Responsibility. I know what the word is. Come on, I'll get you your precious money. Why am taking these stupid lessons, anyway? I mean, what's the point? I'm losing my friends. I lost my boyfriend-- Shit! You should have told me! What? That learning would complicate your life? That it would change your life? You knew that's what you wanted. That's why you pursued me. That's why you made me change my life. What have you done? I don't see anything. I swore I'd never teach again. I was finished! No more bureaucracy. No more banging my head against the stone wall. No more chasing down students because of a paper they wrote on Paul Robeson. Oh, no. You got that look on your face. Shit. You hate it. The thing is, Mr. Cleamons, I couldn't get with it at first, you know? It's like, great actor, great singer, great athlete. Why'd he go to Russia? Then I kept reading, and I got the answer. Racism. But then the man comes back. Why'd he do that? Because-- I think because America was his home. That's what I think. You always go home. Nicole. Your paper was excellent. I want you to take the GED. The GED? Yes. You could get a diploma. You could go to college. You could do anything! Nicole, I don't want to lose you. I mean, I've-- Look, I'm not saying it's going to be easy. But you're the one. I mean, you are the one who wanted your life changed. Yeah, but Mr. Cleamons, come on. To take the GED? I mean, that test is definitely hard. - You gonna help me? - No. You are going to-- - help yourself. - help myself. I know. [laughs] God, you never change, do you? No. Maya Angelou: Study. Study. Put it in the brain. This machine will do anything for you. Anything. It will take you to China if you want to go. It will take you to New York if you want to go. Somebody is going to make laws for this entire land. Is it going to be you? Is it going to be you? The chance is there. It's so exciting. You have a chance. I have you in my heart. I see myself in you. I hope you see yourselves in me. Yeah, right on. 18 big ones. All right. - Yo, Nicky. - Crack it like that. See? And then, of course, you use this to take it out. Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mr. Cleamons. It's quite all right. Quite all right, my dear, my dear. When you open the claw, you got to scoop-- Why you gotta dig it out? This is stupid. Because-- Crystal, look. Instead of-- look. See what I'm doing? See what I'm doing? Look at that. Go Nicky! It's your birthday! It's your birthday! Go Nicky! Go Nicky! It's your birthday! - Woo! - All right! - Happy birthday, Nicky. - Happy birthday. 18, girl. You made it. - Make a wish. - Make it a good one. Aw, happy birthday, girl. Okay, so, what else do you want? Uh, just a little time. A few answers. I mean, you do got some time, right? You're not going anywhere, are you? [laughing] Why did Will quit teaching? You didn't ask him? Nah, no. I thought that-- Well, there was a boy named Michael Ferguson. He was a very bright, smart, special boy, and Will tried to save him from-- The streets. The world. Michael was trouble. There was nothing Will could have done. But he blamed himself anyway. Will always had a good eye for investments. [buzzer] Time's up? It's like that. Girls: ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ Five, six [laughing] Shit. Ruthie! Ruthie? Where's my money? Did you take my money? Did you or didn't you? I borrowed it. Ruthie! Baby, I needed it, so I took it. Ruthie, that money was for my lessons. All right? Why did you do that? Mama's neighbor called! Mama's sick, mama's very sick. I don't want her to see me looking bad, Nicole! So I borrowed the money. Honey, I wanted her to be proud of me. Look, see? [sighs] Honey, I'm not drunk. I don't want to be drunk. That's why I don't feel good. I want to be sober when I make peace with me mother. I don't have the money for my lesson today, Mr. Cleamons. The envelope is empty. Then why did you put it on my desk? Because I wanted to finish my lesson before I told you. It's just I have to know so much for my test. Then why do you tell me now? I don't know, I don't know. I just-- My mother needed the money for an emergency. My grandmother is really sick. I'm sorry, Nicole. Really sorry. You want to postpone the lesson? Well, open your notebook, and don't worry about the money. We'll deal with that later. That's it? I was so scared, you know? I mean-- I didn't want you to think I was making no excuses. You told me the truth? Yeah. Well, the truth is never an excuse. Hmm. I know what you always say. You know, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet? You scare me when you say that, you know? I mean, but the more I thought about it all these months, the more I am coming to see that you may be right. I want that kind of strength, Mr. Cleamons. You never let weak-minded people stop you or hold you back. You just went out, you got whatever you wanted, and if somebody got in your way, well, hey, it's on them, you know? I know that's what it takes. I know that that's how I gotta be. That's why I was scared coming here, because I don't-- I just don't want you thinking that I'm making any excuses because I know what you expect of me. And that's not what life is about, is it? Maybe we should skip the lesson for today. Tell me about you. Did Paul care about you? Well, yes he did. Well, in the beginning, I thought he did. Later, he became a rapist who was practicing at home. So you... He was drunk. And he became abusive. He said, "You won't make it through the night." He grabbed me by the hair with one hand and with the other he shoved the barrel of a gun in my mouth. I tried to scream, but nothing would come out. Just choking sounds. He was yelling. "Shut the fuck up, bitch." Then he took the gun out of my mouth, and hit me in the head with it. When I came to, he was passed out on top of me. So I reached for the gun beneath him but he woke up, grabbed me by the throat, and before I knew it, I'd shot him. Dead. You had to do it. He would've killed you. Well, try telling that to the court. You're afraid of a lot of things, aren't you, Nicole? Well, let me tell you. After that moment, I have never been afraid of anything. Yo, girl, you gotta take care of this mess quick now, okay? - Yo, here comes Nicky. - Hey, what is it? What's going on? She gotta go to the doctor and get rid of this baby. What? Teresa, is that what you want? I don't know, okay? Well, did you tell Hector? I mean, he's the father, right? Yeah, of course, but-- Shit, who is you? A freaking social worker, or something? All of a sudden, you know everything around here. Did he say anything? Hector doesn't know. And even if he did, it doesn't matter what he thinks, Miss Planet Parenthood. It matters, Crystal. It fucking matters. He's the father! Whatever. Don't--No. Don't sweat me. I am not Rhonda, okay? - Fuck you, okay? - No, fuck you. Fuck you and fuck him and these no good ass men. Come on. Teresa, you better think about this. This is like a decision that's going could effect you for the rest of your life! Teresa? Teresa! Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. Take care. Rhonda? - Hi. - Hi. Going back to school? Sorta. I'd like to talk to you. About what? You're a paralegal, right? So? What have you done? Not me. Not me. A woman in prison I know needs some help. Can you help me? - Yeah, I think so. - Yeah? Do you want to go for coffee, maybe? We can talk about the case a little bit more? Yeah, that'd be great. I have this whole file of stuff that, like, if you could just look at it, I mean, I don't really know what to do with it. Okay. Yes, I remember the case very well. She was messed over by the system, Miss Baker. Well, some we've gotten clemency, and some we've gotten new trials, and some, we've gotten nowhere at all. It all depends. Morning, Nicole. Morning. So, who's missing? No one, Mr. Cleamons. Oh? Didn't have time? No, it's just that you didn't have a picture up of the person I wanted to learn about. And who might that be? Well, I thought that it would be nice if you had a picture of woman who made it on the wall not because of her fame, but because of her misfortune in honor of those who have suffered but still manage to survive. Maybe I should. Did you know that the governor of Ohio granted clemency to 26 women convicted of murder or assault on the basis of self-defense? I'm aware of that. And now, in New York you can show that a battered woman is a victim. I talked to this lawyer and she met with Desiree and she's agreed to help her. Don't you think an injustice was done? I don't know. The jury decided she was guilty. Yeah, but what if the jury decided wrong? That has happened in New York, right? Then may God bless her. God bless her? That's all? I know you've got feelings. I know you do. - Look-- - No! Don't you wonder about her? Don't you wonder about how she's doing? Man, you've got me wondering about everything from Pushkin to Harriet Tubman. Don't you wonder about Desiree? [sighs] Look at this library. Your sanctuary. You know, when you first used that word, I didn't know what it meant. But I know now. This is your sanctuary from life. And that's sad because it's beautiful and you got no one to share it with. Your best shot. Remember those words? I'm keeping up my end of the bargain. What the hell is happening with you? Still trying to make up, aren't you? You can't make up for her or for what her suffering has cost the both of you. This deal is not where you're stuck, my brother. You're stuck back there, back where your life shut down. Now, nothing is going to happen with this deal until our friends make up their minds. And nothing is going to get right with your life until you make up your mind. Go, go, go! Hurry up! We're going to be late, man! Hey, Nicole. What are you looking at? I seen you. Yeah, you're looking at me all the time. What's up with that, Nicole? Hmm? Nothing. Come on. Let me know something. Yeah, keep looking. You see, you look. Sooner or later, you're going to have to touch. Hear me? Yeah, you hear me. 'Sup? And no is a word I don't take kindly to. Will, I'm sorry. I just don't know. What is it you don't know, Frank? I need all of you, not just some of you. And time is running out. Look, we're a family. We've been together 14 years. Let's not blow it now. [door opens] Mr. Cleamons. Nicole. I need to talk to you. It's important. Yes, but I'm in a meeting here. - It can't wait. - It will have to. Mr. Cleamons, please. I'm in trouble. Mr. Cleamons, I don't know what to do. I know what I should do, but I'm afraid. Afraid of what? What's going on? It's about Fast Freddy. What about Fred? I know who killed him. I saw. So... What are you going to do about it? I want you to tell me what to do. No. You're strong enough and smart enough to know your own conscience. The responsibility is yours. Yeah, you talk about responsibility in your class, but this is the real world. Fred Shepherd was a friend of mine in the real world. That boy who died with him was someone you also know. You owe them! Yeah, but they're dead, and I'm not! And I don't know what will happen to me if I talk! Nicole, what kind of person are you going to be? Nicole. Where do you draw the line? When are you going to stop being afraid? Why do you have to ask so many questions? Isn't that why you came to me? You knew I'd ask questions, not give you answers. Yeah. Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you risked your life? You live in this nice, big, fucking safe house. I live in Eden Gardens. I risk my life every time I go home, which is where I'm going right now. Thanks for nothing! [cell door closing] Detective Callahan, please. Nicole Turner. He told me to call. Yeah, I could wait. Detective Callahan? ♪ Going in and out ♪ Round and around ♪ Come, come, now second round ♪ ♪ Pull the panties down ♪ Down, down ♪ I'm the freaky type... Freeze, police! Taurus, drop that gun now! What the fuck is going on here? Come on, nobody has to die! - Come on! - Yo, back up! Yo, put your guns down. Nobody will die. Put it down. Nobody has to die, bro. Fuck that! [shouting] Stop or I'll shoot! [gunshots] Ah! Get your fucking hands in the air! Don't you move, asshole! Stay right there! Get him. You're under arrest. [door opening] Hey, buddy, buddy. I just got off the phone. Everybody's on board. You won! The deal is going to fly, Will. Will? Are you all right? Joe, there's something I've got to do. You look good. So why'd you come after all these years? I want you to know I didn't send Nicole. I know that. She talks about you a lot. You made a big impression on her. She made an impression on me. An even better one. So what's the real reason you're here? I just told you. Don't bullshit me, Will. We were together a long time. It was never your strong suit. Why do you think I came? You want to let go of something. What? Pain, maybe. You don't know how hard it was for me to make this trip. Maybe I have some idea. Let me tell you, maybe I could've-- Maybe I should've hung in a little longer with you. waiting for you, banging on your door, but you just made it impossible. Now, you won't admit it or you can't admit it, but you were never there for me. I know. You know. I just wanted you there for me. I remember everything about you, Des. The way your eyes sparkled. The way your hair smelled. You're still beautiful. I'm older, Will. A lot more miles on me, but I'm not running away anymore. Not trying to bury my head in the sand. It's just hard seeing you. Very hard. I know. You look great, though. The gray hair makes you look, um... Old. Distinguished. Now who's doing the bullshitting? So then what is this? A trip to the past? Well, I don't know. I certainly don't want to run away or hide my head in the sand. After you left me, Des, I was stuck for a long time. But I'm getting it back together now. I'm a survivor, too. I just wanted to see you. Mr. Cleamons, what's going to become of me? I'll be okay, right? Don't worry. You're going to pass the GED with flying colors and then you'll go on from there. Oh, by the way, I've been meaning to give you this. It's from Spelling College in Atlanta. And if you pass the test and apply, I think you'll be in line for a scholarship. Me? [laughs] Go to Atlanta? Mr. Cleamons, your house is about as far from Brooklyn as I've ever been. Well, you'll go a lot farther, Nicole. As long as you come back. We need you here. [no audible dialogue] [laughing] ♪ [techno] [cheering] [laughing] What's so funny? Nothing. Just...my baby girl done grown up. Yeah, well, I won't feel grown up 'til I'm out of here. Going to Atlanta, you know. I know. You know, Ruthie? Hmm? I'm not running away from you. I know. You just want to get away. I understand what that's about, believe me. And I am so proud of you. [laughing] I'm proud of you, too, Mom. Thank you, baby. [tires screeching] Hey, Nicole. What's happening? 'Cause our boy just got picked up, and we were just wondering if you had anything to do with it. Who's your boy? 'Aight. Miss Turner, where were you at 10 P.M. on the evening of September 27th, 1996? I was working at Fast Freddy's. It's a hamburger joint on Fulton Street. And what, if anything, happened at that time? I was working behind the counter, cleaning up, and this man came in and he was carrying a gun. He robbed us and he shot and killed Freddy and Gary. Do you see the person who fired the gun in this courtroom today? Yes, I do. He's sitting right over there. Let the record reflect that Miss Turner has indicated the defendant, Taurus McKnight. Everything. I thought I'd find you here. I'm going to miss this room. Seems so empty with all the photos gone. It's funny. I almost feel like I lost my sense of purpose since I took the last one down. There's one more left. I've been saving for this moment. Where? Her name is Nicole Turner. And I'm proud to have her up on my wall. ♪ Even though you never treat me right ♪ ♪ Still I want to spend half There, there, there! You feel it? Yes! Oh, my God, you gotta do this! Ooh, this is a strong kid. [laughing] Ooh. I'm gonna miss hanging out with you guys. [laughing] Yo, why y'all keep acting like this is it? How come all of a sudden everybody but me got places to go and things to do? I've been thinking about going back to school and shit. You know, getting my diploma. Why the fuck not? You're serious? Dead-ass serious. Crystal's gonna get her some education. Shut up. Right. Hi, Lewis. You look different, baby. Yeah? Yo, I heard. What? You know, that you going. That you got some place to go. I'm glad for you. You deserve it. You're about to get up out of here. You just can't let them stop you. Thanks. I'll talk to you. I'm here. Bye. Nicky. I'll see you. Have a nice trip, Nicky. All right. Oh, sweetie, take care of yourself, you hear? - Thank you. - No, thank you. So much. All right. Take care. Bye. Nicky: Bye. Bye. Thank you. Thank yourself. You made the choices that brought you to this day. I'm gonna come back, Mr. Cleamons. I said I would, and I will. For you. Your $10 fees. For a rainy day. I saved them for you. It's the best investment I ever made. I love you, Mr. Cleamons. - I'm gonna miss you. - Get on that plane. Just go get on the plane. Your bag. It's okay. Thank you. Dr. Martin Luther King: For some strange reason, I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. The rich man can never be what he ought to be until the poor man is what he ought to be. John Donne caught it years ago and placed it in graphic terms: "No man is an island entire of itself. "Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main," and then he goes on toward the end to say, "any man's death diminishes me, "because I am involved in mankind, "and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee." [laughing] She says-- Oh, well.
