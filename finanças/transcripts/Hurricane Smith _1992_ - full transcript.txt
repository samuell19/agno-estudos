Yeah. This is sheriff Wilson's office. Billy Ray Smith, please. Hey, yo, Billy! Hey, hold up, man! Hold up! Hey, the sheriff's on the phone. Billy Ray here. This is Earl. The hospital called about 20 minutes ago. I'm afraid the news ain't good. It's about your mama. She passed on about a half an hour ago. I'm sorry about that. We'll need your sister to sign some papers. There's a few legal complications involving your mother's will. As long as I'm here, I'll take care of everything. You know that. I know what you're getting at. What will you do about your sister, then? I'll be damned if I know. Any idea where she's at? Last we heard, somewhere in Australia. Tried, but couldn't reach her. Now I got a reason to find her. Anything I can do to help you, you know I'm here. You're a good man. This one I've got to take care of myself. I understand. Stay out of trouble, you hear? All right. [FISHERMAN] He's getting away! [INDISTINCT TALKING] I've got him! I've got him! Give over, mate! Bloody beauty! He's a big one. Come on. Come on, young mate. What a little ripper. Keep that rod up. Hold on to him! That's it. Beautiful! How's about a little skin diving? Courtesy of your friends Howard Fenton and Charlie Dowd. Hey, you bastards! [FISHERMAN] The Gillespies will get you for this! Help me! Come back here! [CHARLIE] The bastard will be sleeping with the fishes by now. Don't worry. It's being taken care of... As we speak. It had better, Charlie. You had better get that other bastard as well. The authorities, Charlie, will they muck everything up? Don't worry, Howard. What can they prove? Ha ha ha! Head 'em up! [YELLING] Place your bets, gentlemen. O.K., guys. There's the double-crossing rat now. Uhh! Uhh! Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Brisbane, gateway to Queensland and the magnificent gold coast. Sir, welcome to the gold coast. Thank you. Howdy. Hi. Do you mind if I sit up front? No worries, mate. But I'll do the driving, o.K.? Ha ha ha. We drive on the left side over here. You're the American gentleman looking for his sister? The last post card we got came from surfers. Time before that she sent us these pictures. Nice-looking girl. Yeah, well, this is definitely surfers, all right. Probably the Southern end towards broad beach, I'd say. She didn't include her return address? No. She's been moving around a lot this past year. I see. Excuse me, Peter. Excuse me. Mr. Smith, do you have a passport on you? Yes, sir. Could I see it, please? Is there a problem? Well, there appears to be no record of your sister ever entering or leaving the country, which, on the strength of your photographs, means she's liable to criminal prosecution for being an illegal alien. Thank you. Where to, mate? South. How far south? Sydney's south, about 500 miles. Just south. It might help if I knew what you were looking for. I'm looking for a house. A house. Any particular kind of house? Want a house on any particular street, perchance? You're doing real good. Just keep heading the way you're heading, mate. [RADIO] Another murder in the continuing gang war on the gold coast. Police have no suspects in the latest killing, a hit-and-run, and speculate that rival gangs are in competition for the distribution of illegal drugs throughout southeast Queensland. More news at 4:00 here on radio gold. We head south, we stay close to the water, and we look for a house. What is this, candid camera? Anything can happen day? It just did. This is it. Here you go. Keep the change. Hey, thanks for nothing. Septic. Come in, Mr. Nelson. [BUZZ] Anybody home? [WOMAN] Help yourself to a drink. You're a little early. Mr. Nelson. No. I'm Billy Ray Smith. O.K., Billy. How about a drink? No, thank you. I'm here because I'm looking for somebody. Got a picture of her. Well, that's Sally. Sally Mae Smith. You know her? What's going on here? Who are you, mate? I'm Billy Smith. Looking for my sister. Yeah? And I'm Madonna. Jesus, Julie! What are you doing? Letting anybody in here? Are you a narc, mate? No, and I don't give a rat's ass what you're doing. I'm just looking for answers. Here's your answer. Out. Give him a chance. Shut up. We've got clients. Put that thing away. He's Sally's brother. I'll handle it! [BUZZER] Nelson. I rang earlier. Get out. All right, all right. We're trying to run a business here. Get out. [JULIE] Make an appointment next time. [BUZZER] Ask for Julie. Yeah, don't you worry. I'll be back. Hello, Mr. Nelson. Julie's expecting you. Just go in. She's ironing her school dress. Oop. It's like this, chuckles. We don't know your sister. Never seen her. We don't want to see you again. So, Nick off. Hey...Hey! Cousin, you got poor communication skills. Shit. Go inside and tell that lady I'll be back, just like I said, o.K.? O.K.? O.K. And stay out! Don't worry about it, mate. It happens to us all. Family troubles, stress at home. Drop back later. I've got a great girl. She does it without a condom. It's filthy. You'll love it. I'm flying back to Sydney tonight. Give our Sydney office a call, mate. Free time, double time, champagne, the works. Bubble baths, condoms... Cheer, Matey, bye. Look, I'm sorry, all right? I don't know what happened. I couldn't go through with it. You'd better get your act together. If Mr. Dowd finds out you're knocking back clients, we'll both wish we'd never been born. I don't understand you, love. You're a pro. What happened? Was it that black guy, eh? Was it that black bastard, the one who said he was Sally Mae's brother? I haven't heard from Sally Mae since she cleared out. You don't know if he was Sally Mae's brother. He could be working for the Gillespies. They gunned down arkie Davis. I was there. You will be in traction unless you get your act together. You'd tell me if something happened to her. We went through a lot together. She was my best friend. Julie, nothing happened to her. Nothing happened to her. She went back to the states, like she said. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Why is her brother looking for her? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Jesus, Julie. You don't know he was her brother. He could have been her ex-lover, her father, anybody... I don't know. Hello? Uh...Yeah. Hi, Charlie. Julie? She's not in. She was sick, so I sent her home. She looked like death. Not good for business. Yeah, of course. I'm sorry. Yeah. Uh...Sorry, mate. Yeah, sure. I'll check with you next time. Bye, Charlie. Thanks. The things we do for love. [CAR APPROACHING] [GIRLS LAUGHING] Girls, in you go. Help yourself. You know where everything is. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] You do what I say when I say. Got that, sunshine? Yeah. One of the girls wants to knock off early, you call and check with me. Yeah, o.K. That's just to make sure you get the message. No hard feelings? No, no hard feelings. Glad to hear it. It's supposed to be a party. Shut up. You stay out of it, bitch. You come with me. I'll teach you a lesson about keeping regular hours. Charlie, you're hurting me. The trouble, my love, is you're just bone lazy. Charlie, please. That's a liability in this business. Charlie... Time to teach you bedroom etiquette. [SLAPPING] Ah! That's better, you lazy slut. Charlie... You o.K.? Yeah. Your boyfriend's got a nasty way of showing his affection. Look, I appreciate the helping hand... But you better get the hell out of here before he wakes up. I want to talk to you. This isn't the time or the place. He'll kill us both. I'll count to 10, then I'll start screaming. You know something about my sister, don't you? For Christ's sake, not now. [MOANING] Where can I reach you? I'm staying at a hotel called the Apollo. You're really Sally's brother? Yeah. O.K. O.K. Well, get the hell out of here. Get out. All right. You call me, now. [SCREAMING] I want him. Go! "Police believe the severed arm belonged to "missing Melbourne underworld boss "frank the fat man Davis. "Davis was rumored to have been recruited for the war "for control of drug distribution along the eastern seaboard." Could we change the subject, ro? How would you be? Out surfing, and a severed arm grabs your ankle. Never mind the ankle. The g-spot would never be the same. Time for me to split. Jules has lost her sense of humor. You worried about the ruckus? Nothing to do with me. Mmm... Something to do with our noble and brave protector, though. Christ. Well, well... We still have some unfinished business to discuss from last night. Hello, Charlie. Haven't found your heavy-handed friend. But we will... With a suntan like that, it shouldn't be hard. He's not my friend. I never saw him before. Shanks tells me he's a relative of miss long tall Sally. She was your friend. I'm sorry about yesterday. I'll make up the time. I'll do a Sunday night. She'll do a Sunday night. Charlie, I've got to go. Maybe you know more than you're letting on. No, I don't. Like where the bastard's staying. Maybe you two have something going. Charlie-- don't answer back. Just listen to me. Hello, Mr. Fenton. If I find that you're holding out on me, I'm liable to get very cross with you. You know that, don't you? Very, very cross. Yes. Charlie, that's enough. I said, "that's enough." Do I make my point? I want to talk to you about some details... In my office...Now. I've put word out. We're ready to make a deal with our rivals, the Gillespies. Should make their day. How long before you're ready to move? Relax. That can wait. I've got another matter to deal with first. What's that? Someone getting a little possessive about one of the girls. Uh-huh. An American. Don't worry. It's being taken care of... As we speak. He's being picked up now. I hope so, Charlie. Hi, sweetheart. Any trouble? Quiet as a lamb. Really? Hmm. Let's see what he's really made of. Hey, Charlie. Hey, boy. A bit of fun? Yeah, Charlie. This the place where somebody gets his ass kicked? Yeah. Just you and him. Mind you, I could take you. I just don't want to get my hands dirty. Didn't mind touching his sister, though. Shh! You'll upset him. Well, go on then. There's no rules. Ha ha ha! Yeah. This is going to be fun. First you, right? Ugh! Yeahh! Aah! This fun enough for you? Ooh! You awake? Ugh! You left me with quite a headache last night. All for nothing. You see, your sister's gone, Billy. Business. Don't get me wrong. We liked your sister. Most of us knew her intimately, in fact. Ugh! She was a big hit for a while. Ohh! Not many black girls on the coast, but the novelty wore off. You know how it is. The money stopped coming in. The rest is history. She left town, Billy, and so should you. Jesus, Charlie! Her brother? No sweat, Howard. I took care of it. That's what you pay me all the lolly for. Fine. I just don't want any screw-ups. We scared him pretty good. He was some backwoods nigger from the farm. Nothing's changed. I hear you, Charlie. I hear you. But so help me, if anything goes wrong-- Charlie knows what he's doing. You worry too much. It's my dick on the chopping block, not Charlie's! In a few days' time, your worries will be all over. Trust me, o.K.? [KNOCK ON DOOR] Who is it? Sylvester Stallone, mate. Come on! Open the door! I haven't got all day! Come on, mate! Hurry up! Yeah, yeah. Just hold on. It's already open. Come on in. What took you so long? Hey! What are you doing? Hey! That was a nice hello. Do you treat everybody like that? What do you want? Julie sent me, asshole. She wants to see you. When? Now. Where? It's not far. I'll take you. And pack some socks and undies. You better not be screwing me around, my little Aussie friend. I just hear things. Where is she? She's in there, mate. Where? It's not a big place. You'll find her. She doesn't tell me everything she does. Oy! Have you got my gun? Yeah, shanks. I got it right here. You want it, come with me. [DOG GROWLS] Get out of here! Back off, you! You stupid dog! No doubt about your old dog, Griffo. He doesn't take to everyone. He can pick a nasty piece of work. Stupid black Yankee! You're not in Texas now! Stand around too long, you might be mistaken for a piece of shit! Well, hi. Hi. Is it o.K. If I sit down? Yeah. Sorry. [GRUNTS] Are you all right? Yeah. I'm all right. Well, I'm here. You said you want to talk, so let's talk. We'll talk, but are you o.K.? What happened last night? I had a meeting with Charlie. I'll be back. Wait. Where are you going? I'll be back. Griffo. I'll fix you a room here. This is not the bloody dew drop inn, you know? Apart from that, he's a bloody septic! He's a what? A septic tank. A yank. He means a black American. I don't give a rat's ass whether you're black, white, or blue. You're a yank. You got something against Americans? Apart from they're a bunch of loud-mouthed, self-opinionated bastards who robbed the country blind during the last world war, not a thing. Now that you know each other, let's get you settled in. I don't make this a habit, so it's pretty basic. Tourists are nothing but a pain in the ass! But the dog seems to like you. He's not a tourist. Just don't wear out the welcome. I don't take messages or give out keys. If you're not back by closing, your best bet is a park bench! Damn silly old fart. It's nothing personal. He's like that with everyone... Till he gets to know them. Yeah, especially the septics, right? Are you sure about this? Griffo reckons it's about the best thing to take the swelling down. He was a professional pug in his younger days. So you're Sally's big brother. Yeah. Hurricane Smith. Did you really drag Sally out of a barn in the middle of a hurricane and save her life when you were 14? Yeah. People started calling me hurricane, and the name stuck. Sally Mae had some pretty wild stories about home. We never knew if she was telling the truth. She got pretty out of it sometimes. Julie, do you know where my sister is? She's not here, Billy. She left surfers to go back to the states around Christmas time. She wanted to get back to see her mum. She's a little late. I'm sorry. Last letter we got was postmarked surfers. She said she was having a good time, met a lot of nice people, had a nice job. Like me. Yeah. Sally was my friend, o.K.? We shared an apartment. And no, she didn't work at the house, if that's what you're thinking. She just picked me up after my shifts. What you do is none of my business. I ain't got nothing against whores. But you wouldn't want your sister to be one. Ow! Don't patronize me, all right? I'll stand for a lot of things, but not that. Look, I didn't mean anything by it, o.K.? I'm sorry. You know something? That feels a whole lot better. You been to the cops yet? No. No record of her coming into the country. I can't promise anything, but I'll ask around and see what I can find out. Don't have to go to all that trouble. I'm doing it for Sally. Where are you going? My apartment to change. I'm late for work. I'll see you home. Thanks, but that isn't necessary. It is where I come from. Good looks and manners to boot, eh? That's the thing about us septics. The ones from Texas anyway. I'd ask you up, but I have-- but you have to go to work. That's right. It's party time. Thanks for seeing me home. I'll call you if I hear anything. [RUMMAGING] Bitch! Lying, double-crossing bitch! You slut! I'll rip you apart! Go! Right. Go after her! Aaah! There she is! Stop! Stop the bus! Help! Let's go! Let's go! Stop! What the hell's going on? [HONKS HORN] [HONKS HORN] Shit. Whoa! Aaah! [HONKS HORN] Oh, Jesus! Call an ambulance! Anyone alive in there? Jesus! Shit! Can I help you? Are you o.K.? Shit! [TRIES TO START ENGINE] Someone get some help! [ENGINE ROARS] Not again! [KEYS JINGLING] What's going on? I've got nowhere else to go, Billy. Charlie Dowd, right? Just hold me. What's on your mind? This is more complex than it seems. There's nothing you can do about it till morning. Get some rest. I'm worried about you, Billy. Hey... Don't you worry. I'm going with you tomorrow. No, you're not. I thought you said we're a team. I guess I did say that, didn't I? Shh! Hey! Come on! Come on! Sit down, mung. Come behind. Come behind, I said! You're lucky he didn't take your leg off. He's a good-looking animal. He's a killer... If he's in the right frame of mind. Go on. Been doing a little fishing? No. I've been chasing the fruit bats off the avocados. Good-looking car. Who's it belong to? My car. My boat. I wouldn't be taking all this trouble over somebody else's stuff. Why? The way you feel about us septics, you and this Pontiac make an odd couple. You lot aren't hot socially, but you can put a decent car together... Or you did once. What's the problem? What do you know about Julie? I know she spent the night in your room. She's in trouble, Griffo. What? After just one bloody night? Ain't got nothing to do with me. It's with the people she works for. She sings in a club. How can you get in trouble singing in a club? What's going on? Texas is concerned about your health. My health has never been better. I was in the area-- you don't have to explain so long as he pays for the room. I'm trying to help him find-- I've heard enough on that subject! I've fish to clean. All I said was-- I heard what you said. It was too bloody much. What happens to me is my business. That wasn't exactly how it was last night. [JULIE] Main beach. At least we got an address to go to. Just do like the lady says. Been in the country three days and they think they own it. Here you go. Keep the change. Hey, hey. I been just trying to help. Yeah, well, don't. What's going on with you and Griffo? He happens to be my grandfather, o.K.? Nice move, Billy Ray. When you pull your own foot out your mouth, maybe you can fit Kareem Abdul-jabbar's in there. Hey, Julie, look, I apologized to you before. I've been wrong and I don't mind saying so. Come on now. I want to say I'm sorry. Will you accept my apology? I'm sorry, all right? O.K. And then I met Damien. Who's Damien? That's shanks' real name. Ha ha ha! Little Damien? He hates it though. Oh, my. Wait until I see him. Damien, huh? Like it. Woo! You know, you look great when you smile. Where did you meet my sister, anyway? We met at a party. We were both smashed. We instantly became friends. She said she always wanted a sister... And ended up with a dumb big brother. I apologized to you. What is this, payback? She thinks you're the best thing since sliced bread. She's a smart lady. This way. Hey, careful. Jesus Christ! Shit! Hey, what's fucking going on? Charlie. Charlie. All right, you big dork, you can butt out now! This doesn't fucking concern you! You want to make yourself useful? Yeah. Clean up this mess. And start with your mouth. What are you looking for? There's a video of Sally and me. We were at this party together. All right, freeze, you tall streak of duck shit, or I'll blow you from here to kingdom come. Don't put your hands near your gun! Shanks, what are you doing? I'm protecting you, babe. This bastard's the cause of all our troubles. Put the gun away. No way, sweetheart. This bastard's going to get what he deserves. Your safety's on. Ha ha ha! He'll be o.K. He means well. Just watches too many late-night movies. Come on, Shanksie. Come on. Wake up, cowboy. Wake up. [LAUGHTER] Who's the guy Sally Mae's hanging all over? That's Howard Fenton on Fenton's boat. He's Charlie Dowd's boss. They'd just sailed down from southeast Asia together. What does this Fenton do? This and that. Right now, he's trying to take over the local drug trade. So that's how she got in the country with no entry visa. She loved to party. She came in on his boat, Julie. 10 to 1, he's the guy who can tell me more. I need to see this Fenton. Lots of luck. He's got wall-to-wall bodyguards. Julie, I just need an address. You'll never get him at the club. But according to Shanks, he still enjoys the two-up. What's two-up? It's another quaint little Aussie custom where you gamble a week's wage at the toss of a coin. Come in, spinner! Headed them! All right, gentlemen. There's 100 in the center. I'm in! I'm in! 100 on tails. What are you doing? I'm placing a bet, man. The spinner's hot! He's on a roll! Are you crazy? I'm real crazy! He's hot, and he's on a run! You're about to wave bye-bye to 100 bucks! We'll see about that. Come in, spinner. Make it right. Make it right. A crazy man, Shanks! I'm a crazy man! The tide goes in, the tide goes out. Tails! Yay! Looks like the tide just came in. Do you want to spin? He's just looking. He's a tourist. I want to spin! All right. Everything rides on tails, right? Tails, here we go! Tails! [CHEERS] One more time! Let it all ride! This game's gone sour. I'm leaving. What about Fenton? Fenton wouldn't show up here. I said that to get Julie off me back! Are you pissed at me or what? Nah, Shanks. The thing you got to understand about us septics is it's all forgive and forget. It's just beginner's luck, you tinny bastard. You deserve some of this. You helped me. You won it fair and square. 1000 bucks here. Tell me where my sister is and it's yours. 1000 bucks, Damien. Hey... Put your 1000 bucks back in your pocket. I don't know where your sister is. And don't call me Damien! My mother's bigger than you, and I've decked her for calling me Damien-- listen, you little shit! I want to know where my sister is! I want the whole truth, Damien! You're going to punch the shit out of me. Damn right I am. All right, let's hear it. Fenton met Sally in Bangkok. He was doing some business. She was smacked out of her head. My sister was a junkie? It happens in the best of families, mate. When she got back to surfers, she moved in with Julie. She straightened up and booked a ticket for the states. She never made it back to the states! Maybe she's dead? Is my sister dead, Damien? Listen, Billy, I don't like any of this. For your own sake, just drop it. All right, enough bullshit. Sally was Fenton's girl, wasn't she? Annabel is Fenton's girl. Sally is just Sally's girl. But she went with Fenton! You'd have to ask her that. God damn it, I'm asking you! Yes. All right. She was on with Fenton. Would you two mind holding it down to a dull roar? Julie, I don't give a damn how much muscle Fenton got. I want to get to him now. Howard Fenton, the big-time punter? Yeah. Stay out of this, Griffo. You don't know anything. Is that so? My friend Scully trains horses for a fella called Howard Fenton. They happen to be very close. How close, Griffo? I could always give him a ring, see what the score is on the track work sessions. You two probably have another brilliant idea. Give him that call. Yeah. You make the call, Griffo. You're a proper little Bobby-Dazzler. Don't know what we'd do without you, Griffo. It's been a long night, mate. I'm not in the mood to play games. Shanks, tell the man what he wants to know. What did you tell the nigger? I haven't seen him. Come on, Shanksie. You took the nigger to the two-up, had a big win. Aah! You're spoiling my big day, mate, you know that? [HORSE NEIGHS] Mmm. He's back in good form again, Howard. Good. About time he started to show some form. You expecting company? No, I'm not. Arthur. I'll see to the horses. Arthur, see who it is. Do you remember when you called me a silly old fart? Yeah, I remember. Well, what would you say if this silly old fart told you he was packing a heater? I'd say that makes two of us. Good morning, Mr. Fenton. My name is Griffith. I'm a friend of your trainer, Mr. Scully. This is Mr. Smith. Hurricane Smith from Texas. He's in construction. I'm his business manager. Welcome, gentlemen. What can I do for you? Mr. Fenton, I understand we have a common interest in horses among other things. Oh? You're in construction? Yes, ma'am. Construction is my prime concern, but horses...Now that's my passion. What do you think of the Colt then, Mr. Smith? My trainer thinks he'll make a pretty handy derby prospect. It's a little early to tell, but looking at those hindquarters, he won't last more than a mile. We race in meters here. We do things the European way. So my sister tells me. She's also interested in horses. You probably met her here at the track. Her name's Sally Mae. Indeed, we have. Sally Mae's an old friend of ours, isn't she, Howard? Yes, an old friend. Mr. Fenton, I'd really appreciate it if you could put me in contact with her. I'd love to hook up with her. We may be able to. Howard's throwing a party to celebrate a small killing in the market. Why don't you join us on our yacht? Thank you. We'd be honored, sir. Good. 12:00 sharp. My Marina. It'll be like a surprise family reunion for you. It certainly will. Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Smith. I have a rather busy schedule. Yes, sir. Oh, Mr. Smith... Don't be late. I don't like to be kept waiting. That cruise is asking for trouble, son. Put one foot on that boat, and you're gone a million. Do you hear me? Yeah, I hear you. Mung? Hey, boy. Julie! Julie! Bloody bastards! What time is it? 3 minutes to 12:00. Where's the bastard? Asshole! [HONKING HORSE] Here he is. Hey, wait! Wait for me! Yo, Fenton! Hey, Fenton! He's seen her. I'll take her below. Wait for me! [HORN HONKS] [HONKING HORN] 20 bucks! What are you, a Nazi? Where's Billy? The boat. Dowd's put a bomb on the boat! Why don't you sit down, Mr. Smith? Relax. [GRIFFO] Billy! Hey! Get off the boat! There's a bomb in it! Jump! There's a bomb! [Fenton] Arthur. Three for the price of one. And they'll think it's the Gillespie mob. Nothing I could do, Griffo. They worked me over. Go easy on the whiskey. That's all you're getting. It hurts! Of course it hurts. It serves you bloody well right. You told them where she was. There was nothing I could do! You're weak as piss. The blokes that worked at the Burma railroad would leave you lot for dead. Bloody lot of pansies in earrings. Here. Give us that. What are you doing? What are we doing? We're going to get my granddaughter back. Griffo, they'll kill us. We'll die with our boots on, like Billy did. He ain't dead yet, Griffo. Holy bloody hell! What are we going to do about Julie? Bait for the sharks. She knows too much. Hmm. Like Sally. Fenton was a fool. He had no class... Like his girls... Like this house. Time for a change. Right! Let's go! It's my bloody boat! Sorry, mate. He knows the way. Go build a railroad, you silly old creep! Here, Billy. You might need this one, too. Thanks, Griffo. The visitors. Let Charlie know. Get going! Shit! We got company. You sure you know how to drive this? Just like driving a dune buggy on water. I'll ride shotgun. [GUNFIRE] Come on! Get going! Great going! Faster, mate! Gun it, will you? I'm giving it everything I've got! Shit! Shit! Shit! Hang a right! Hang on! Here we go again! Shit! Can't you get away from them? Right! Go right! No, go left! What is this, Disneyland? Do you get the feeling they don't like us? Holy shit! Whoa! I'm too young for this shit! So am I. Let's go get Julie. Evacuate! What is it? It's that black bastard. Stay here. I'll take care of Julie. What's going on? What about me? I'll cover you. Yo, Damien! Julie! Julie! [SIREN] Julie! Julie! You dirty rat! Where is she? Shanksie, you check down here? Not yet. Quick, cover the door. I'll find Julie. Shanks! Billy! Billy! Billy! Shanks, are you o.K.? I've had better days. Get...Get Julie. [SHANKS] Billy, look out! It's her! It's Julie! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! This is the police! You are surrounded! Throw down your gun, and release the girl! You are surrounded! Let the chopper down! Throw down your gun and release the girl! Get that chopper down, or I'll kill her! Get it down! Heli-one, police mobile unit. Offender's taken female hostage. He's currently armed and requires you to land. Over. [FEMALE DISPATCHER] Please advise. Heli-one. We're down. Request further instructions. Hold your positions, men! [DISPATCHER] Heli-one, stand-by. Get this damn thing out of here! Go! Aaah! Dowd! Aah!

Billy! Billy, be careful! I can't hang on! Hold on, Julie! I'm slipping! Grab my arm! Come on! Aah! Hey, you o.K.? Yeah, I'm O.K. I'll get us down all right. Where did you come from? Texas. Ahh!
