- What about Kasia? - She dumped me. - I'm not surprised. - Neither am I. - Was there anyone after that? - I went back to my Mom's and lived with her for 18 years. Quite a lot. - Were you getting along? - At times. - Did you tell her of your problems? - No, of course not. So why did you wait with coming to me until now? Now I have fallen in love. You don't say! Even a blind monkey finds a banana sometimes. Tell me about it. Ironically I've fallen in love with my kindergarten teacher's daughter. Would you believe that? ALL ABOUT MY PARENTS I'm Krzys Mysliwski sitting with my Mom at a kid's psychologist. I hate kindergarten and to remedy that I need to be there for 30 days with my Mom. That might stop me from screaming, rolling on the floor, peeing my pants. And my mom? She will regain her joy of life that she kind of lost lately. You need to stay with him in the kindergarten for a while. Just think that it is pleasant and can bring a lot of joy into your life. The psychologist smiles cordially - and my Mom answers with concentration: - I will try. - And adds right away: - Right? Now you can see my face. The face of a 3-year old boy, which doesn't look bright yet and might evoke some sense of unease or doubt if fate will be favorable to him. Remember that any behavior of a little human being has or can have some sense - which is hidden from us, adults. - Which means...? That rolling on the floor, pissing his pants SYSTEMIC THERAPY DOESN'T CURE SYMPTOMS, IT CURES FAMILY or sharpening crayons is a communication to the world or about the world. Do you get it? Not really. In that case think of yourself. For sure there are many things that should be done in the garden. I didn't realize then that that conversation would change our lives so much. None of us was ready for such consequences. Neither me nor my Mom. And for sure not my Dad. ME Hi. Hi. And then my favorite part of the evening follows. My mom bathes me in the bathtub. Of course she's naked and I'm looking at her. Putting it in a more literary way: On a big screen of life naked Mom rubs her breasts against a 3-year old rascal, whose only aim is to eat her. Just eat your Mom, so there's nothing of her left. Not only for Dad, but for everybody who wants to spoil our evening together. Because later is bedtime and I sleep alone in my cozy bed. That's what life in 1 room looks like: me, my parents and my Oedipus complex. In the future to do something about it I have become a writer. As I write prose, one of my stories could have such a beginning. Nothing doing. That's only how my session began, from the first connotation that came to my mind. From the first mysterious sentence I've already seen somewhere. SYSTEMIC THERAPY DOESN'T CURE SYMPTOMS, IT CURES A FAMILY All right. Let's start from the beginning. You came to me because of ejaculatio praecox. Exactly, premature, unfortunately, ejaculation. Don't worry, it's a common complaint. But to find its roots we have to reach into the deepest nooks of your memory. Which means heating up old stew. Each session will cost you 300 zloty. Hard to tell how many sessions there will be: 2 or 150. I can't guarantee the sessions to be effective. In the best case - you'll get well. In the worst case - you'll give up on sex completely. And discover new allures in life. Anyway, after our sessions you'll be a different person. Are you ready for that change? In that moment an image of my Dad stood in my eyes. I am ready. All right. In that case return to kindergarten. Go ahead. THE LAND OF FUN When Zuzia opened the door I was looking in the sky. Hoping for God to help me. Zuzia was looking at my Mom and God wasn't interested in my little drama, because I was just a preschooler with a neurosis syndrome. Hello. - We haven't met. - I've just started working here. I've brought this little rascal and have to be with him here - for a month. - What's going on? - He's very shy? - Why is that so? We'll get rid of that shyness and throw it out of the window. Why out of the window? I don't know. But words were of no importance here because what counted was the picture. The picture of Miss Karolina. Mom like any female is looking at others' offspring. And I'm surrounded by little punks who walk in circles throw a ball or sit in the corner waiting for death which will come in over 70 years. But to me it could come at any moment. I sensed it when I was 2. You're not afraid when I'm with you? The doctor was right. In a month you'll get used to your new surroundings. Miss Karolina is very nice. - She likes you. - And the other kids too. - She has a very good approach. - What is she talking about? About the way Miss Karolina walks among the scattered toys? She has a very good hand with kids. And Miss Hania also seems to be nice. Show me your palm. In a month you'll stay there all day long without crying. For sure I won't cry. Now I can even say that quite contrary I'll be close to feeling pleasure. But I'm still 3 years old and that excludes any pleasure with adult participation. At night I woke up with fever. I was teething or I was getting more seriously ill. In such moments my Mom could count only on herself because Dad in the other room was doing some important task. Four. Here we go... Action. Nights are the most difficult for a model designer. Rejecting the need of closeness with one's partner but also the elementary need of - let me name it openly - sleep. Simply sleep. We commune exclusively with the object of our dreams, our longing and ideals. Yes - ideals. That's why we move away from those close to us but that's the price we pay for designing flying models. One thing for another. Kites were my father's obsession. I don't know why kites. He might as well breed Amstaffs. Yet for some reason he chose kites. For 7 days I was healed at home. And now I'm here again. Standing at the door of my destination and waiting for Mom to let go of my hand. What will begin the 1st act of today's tragedy? You might not guess. Don't play with that. Milk soup is the essence of a preschooler existence. The same prop of degradation of a human being by other human beings as camp prisoners' striped uniform. And never believe those who say that milk soup is healthy. It's as harmful as any other form of enslavement. In a few years Dad will leave Mom to be with a young stewardess. He'll even marry her. For my 8th birthday my Dad will give me a present: a new sibling. But now everything is good. My parents revel. Before I'm born they'll be truly happy. In a moment an ORWO film will be over and Dad will silently swear. Fucking hell! That film was a sign that everything that's beautiful ends at some point. But I never thought it'd be to that extend. That Dad would have new kids and Mom, well... That's very interesting. Do you think so? You have an unrepeatable chance to kill your Dad. Excuse me? Here, during this session. Do you want to use that opportunity? THE 4TH PLACE IN THE KITE BUILDING COMPETITION Why not? Keep talking then. MOM A boy with a guitar is a perfect match for me I could marry him right away I'd be happy as can be, two guitars, you and me. I so need this dream to come true A boy with a guitar is a perfect match for me I'll be crazy about him and he about me. A boy with a guitar is a perfect match for me Oh I want to have him. There were some stories about an eligible girl About a king's daughter who dreamt of a prince charming But I'm not the daughter of a king... I need to go to a meeting in the kindergarten. - Organizational matters again? - I may stay if you want. And who will go? Me? I don't even know where it is. - Exactly - Shall we go to a club on Saturday? - How about that? - Will Mom watch Krzys? Why not? She will if I ask her. And will call in 2 hours and say that Krzys is crying. If you have anything against my mother, tell her about it. You're trying to stir up a sense of guilt in me, about my mother. Fuck it. Are you seeing anyone? Now I'm seeing you, before that, it was your friend and someone else earlier. Generally, I'm seeing men who've got class. I got it. Let's go together to the kindergarten. - Who'll stay with Krzys? - He's sleeping. - He's a sound sleeper. - Of course, I know about it. Shall we go together? You want me to sit at the kindergarten meeting? - What's wrong with that? You know it's not good for me. I'd rather take you to the club. - A swinger's club. - Not necessarily - Any club. - You like swingers clubs the most. My God. I proposed group sex to you just once. And you make so much fuss about it. How was I supposed to feel? I was surprised. You propose to your wife going to a club with group sex. - How should I feel? - How? - You should feel good. - Really? - You think very highly of me. - Don't you have other problems? I do. But my greatest problem is my husband is a model designer, - who needs to buy paper, glue... - No. We're not going to talk like that. I'll show you something. - Hello? - Yes? How about you shit on my plate? You're welcome. I'm sorry. Maybe next time. - Can we talk about Krzys later? - All right. Now we can talk. Will you drink some tea? - Thank you. - Thank you yes or no? - No. - Is something wrong? - No, everything's all right. I'm just organizing things all the time. - I've noticed that. - What would you like to talk about? - Are you in a hurry? No, but I thought there are some things we need to discuss about Krzys. I just said it to keep you here. Actually... it's not about Krzys. I don't follow you. I just thought we could chat a little. - What about? - About anything. If you don't want... - We can talk for a while about anything. How old are you? - Twenty five. - Do you have kids? And I'm not married. Are you? Because you don't have a wedding ring. I have. I haven't noticed it because usually I look at wrists and nails. I've been married for many years already. - Happily? Happily? Absolutely. - Absolutely yes or no? - Yes. Krzys looks like you very much. I don't think so. He's a very sensitive boy. Stands out from other kids. Do you have an other questions? I'm glad that you come here with Krzys, but it must be troublesome. I don't have to be at work every day. When Krzys gets accommodated you'll probably stop coming here or will you keep bringing him here? As much as possible. Anyway, we'll be seeing one another. I'll leave that encounter without a comment. Even after so many years I don't know if it happened and what to think of it. You drove off You drove off so far away And actually all that happened was so insignificant Nothing that matters Almost nothing. Almost nothing. Perhaps I am a little bit more lost in thought. Perhaps I keep looking out the window more often than I should. I go to sleep when the sun rises. When the sun rises. Are you going to jump? Yes, I'm about to commit suicide. Can I watch? Mom didn't die. But was paralyzed from the waist down. Do you remember that period well, or have you pushed it out of your memory? I remember Mom's wheelchair creaking on our linoleum floor. Good for you. You have active memories. Sensually active. Because creaking concerns hearing although it could also concern taste. That means your personality is opening a door for us. And inviting us inside. We don't have to apply cheap tricks with hypnosis. In that case - what about the kindergarten? Hello. I've brought him to leave him for half a day. He'll be good. Life's taught him a lesson. He's grown up. Grandma said it all in one go, in her style. - What's happened? - His mom had an accident. She's alive but the boy is half an orphan in a way. Excuse me? Believe me or not, but a person with an immobile abdomen is an ex-human being. That notion perfectly showed my Grandma's style. Not without reason was it said that she buried her husband alive. If he gets wild don't give him breakfast. This will teach him a lesson. Lunch at home will be enough for him. Discipline is essential. Especially now, when his mother is in such a condition. You must be strict with him or he'll be lost. Do you understand? You'll stay here. Be good. Listen to the lady. And if you don't... I won't come to pick you up, ever. When I was in kindergarten for the 6th week my Mom came back home. Precisely as an ex-human being, as Grandma said, she was brought into the house. Judging by her look Mom didn't suffer from any trauma. She was in no pain, she just couldn't walk. Dad seemed happy with the way things turned out and the wheel chair rolled. On the same day all the tenants from our house threw a welcome party for Mom. Indeed she didn't regain her health, but she regained her life. And...? Is your pussy hungry? It's hard to tell. But if it itches, shall we do something about it? Won't you be scared? I won't. Have you ever done it with a cripple? I only fantasized about it. So you are experienced. One can say so. Do you love me or do you just want it very much? I've met someone. I know. Don't smoke in the presence of a child, a cripple and a hamster. - Hello. - What's the matter? Everything is okay. Krzys is in good hands. - I hope so. - I want to see Krzys's mom. - Are you a social worker now? - No, I just want to talk to her. Well, okay, come in. The kindergarten teacher is here. Mom, please, shut the door. Is anything wrong with Krzys? I've come to pay you a visit. We haven't seen each other for a long time. - That's true. Two months and 7 days. - Do you remember it so precisely? - Even more precisely. Seven days... 4 hours and 15 seconds since our last conversation. That much time has passed. Our chat about anything. Exactly. Please, take a seat. Tea? - Thank you. - Thank you yes or no? No. Please, look at me. I'm 40 years old. And you are 25. If you're not here about Krzys, I don't understand why. - Should I leave? - Please, answer me. I wanted to see how you are. Moderately. Will it go away? Paralysis doesn't go away. I am really much older than you. What's that got to do with it? Besides I have a husband, a son. And you probably have a boyfriend or... or a girlfriend who's waiting for you somewhere. I'm not with anyone. Should I treat it as a... a compliment. Or treat it as you want. I came here because I wanted to. - To check how I was? - I really want to know that. And I mean well. When I saw you for the first time I thought... - that we can talk about everything. - I thought that for a moment too. - And you don't now? - Things have changed. You stopped bringing your son, I expected that. But the rest is insignificant. I'm surprised by your determination. If I care about something, I'm ready for everything. In this unexpected way Mom got on first-name terms with Miss Karolina. I don't know if I was supposed to laugh or cry or to rethink my life as my chances with Miss Karolina fell down almost to zero. How is it at kindergarten? Good? I'm not saying a word. Are you playing with kids nicely? - Miss Hania is nice, isn't she? - I'm not saying a word. And Miss Karolina, does she like you? She likes you. But you like her too, my little man. In the evening Dad tries to give me a bath. When Dad took over her duties, Mom was longing. Actually she was one big longing, misunderstanding and a riddle, but she was less and less a mom. Good evening. The kid is screaming and disturbing the peace. Yes. And in that case we have the right to know what it is about, - don't we? - You do. - So nothing is happening? - That's right. So you got a fine for no reason? That's right. You beat your kid, maybe even molest him and now you also mock the authorities? You mock the peoples' authorities, citizen... Mysliwski. Do you know what punishment is for that? Will you have some tea with raspberries? Yes, please. Luckily Dad just got a fine and wasn't forced to emigrate, but it was a difficult time for everyone. Most of all for Dad who had to save me from dirt. Having drank the tea the constable got an idea I should be gaged to keep me quiet and keep the case away from the court. Dad loved that idea. He gaged me also for other occasions than just a bath, but Mom would always intervene. Evidently she still cared for me in spite of being bewitched by Miss Karolina. Finally fortune smiled on Dad who started playing in films. Just documentaries, but does it realty matter? What counts is that he was on TV. At that time I traded my hamster for comic books with Inspector Marten. INSPECTOR MARTEN CODE NAME "OXYGEN" MEETING AT THE MAJOR'S OFFICE - Are you determined, Inspector? - Yes, Sir. Civil clothes and a civil car are basic. ON THE WAY TO THE ACTION ON THE SPOT I'll check my gun. 30 MINUTES LATER What if I don't get out of that alive? I'm going to put that garden in order. KNOCK KNOCK Oh, that's him. In spite of his success on TV, Dad had problems connected with the passage of time. Let's be honest: At some age erection stops being something obvious. One can risk saying it becomes a holiday one waits for a whole week. Dad waited for it even longer but was always in good company. I had designed that kite model 5 years before. But other things mattered then. I thought it wasn't the right moment and it had to wait. You are the ideal hero of our documentary slot. Do you think so? That day, my father was late for dinner. Hard to tell if anything happened, but he smelled of beautiful perfume when he kissed me good night. Good evening. Good evening. My husband - Krzys's kindergarten teacher. Karolina. Hubert Mysliwski. - You might've woken Krzys. - He is a sound sleeper. One day he won't be. He'll suffer from insomnia like everybody else. My caring dad kissed me goodnight. Obviously he believed that would get us closer but I only smelled perfume and knew that Dad had some secret he was hiding from me and Mom. That was sad and totally beyond my comprehension. DAD Please, relax. - Can we repeat it if I make a mistake? - Whatever you need. Light. - How is it, Kazik? - We'll be ready soon. So I'm holding the tail of that kite. Ready. - Camera. - Roll. - Four. - Rolling. Action! Nights are the most difficult for a model designer. Rejecting the need of closeness with one's partner but also the elementary need of - let me name it openly - of sleep. Simply sleep. We commune exclusively with the object of our dreams, our longing and ideals. Yes - ideals. That's why we move away from those close to us but that's the price we pay for designing flying models. One thing for another. Simply one thing for another. Thank you. How was it? It was a great idea in holding that tail. Yes, thank you. My parents were tolerant as far as educational issues are concerned. And sometimes they let me participate in some pleasures reserved for adults. Honestly I preferred to witness my Dad's experiences as those of my Mom's were too mysterious to me. I've been promoted from the group of Moomins to Mushrooms. That means I've accepted milk soup and stopped rolling on the floor, stamping my feet, screaming and banging my head against the wall. I'm simply a mediocre preschooler, who sits on the carpet as the custom says. Never on the cold tiles. Sometimes plays or draws and irretrievably loses his individuality and importance. Now kindergarten is in me like my liver or lungs. And I'm a pad of a group, a screw in a machine, a grain of sand in a big sandcastle. One day I'll read One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and I'll feel what the main character felt: the system has beaten me. Here goes Hector. Hello. Hello. Come on. I wonder how much longer you're going to spend time with that kindergarten teacher. What do you have to do with her? - Not much. - Instead of sitting at home, resting, lying, reading - you keep going somewhere all the time. I thought that a person who cannot move conjures... some dignity, peace. But you spend all day with that punk who could easily be your daughter. There isn't such a big age difference between us. - Do you know what she is? - A kindergarten teacher. Yes, that too. But what else? You don't know. Let me tell you. Because I know. - I've found it out. - Oh, you're bothered so much. Keep on joking. You don't understand the danger. Danger. Listen. That kindergarten teacher has delicately speaking different inclinations than you and me. - Did you get it? - No. You go for walks with a lesbian. And she teaches our son in the kindergarten. But one can't be fired for you know what. But your friendship with that lady is a different kettle of fish. And it stops being just your business, because I bring home the bacon, take care of your wheelchair - and want nothing but the best for you. - For sure. But do we want that? So you're going to continue it? - I'm not going to resist it. - I thought that a 40 year old woman who has a family knows what's good for her, - or at least knows what is decent. - You're mistaken then. It's very sad that your tragedy hasn't taught you anything. - Do you think so? - Yes, I do. 16 bullets have to do. Boom! Build sandcastles instead of digging for nothing. I'm looking for a worm! You've been sitting for 30 minutes and haven't built any sandcastle. When I was young it was impossible to sit and dig for no reason. The times have changed, there's no obligation to build sandcastles. What are you doing? It's good it's not raining, you'd get all dirty. - I like getting dirty - When you eat your snack - I'll read you a newspaper. - Why not a fairy-tale? I won't read you fairy-tales. Let your father read you that rubbish. My Dad read me newspapers and that was my gain. - It'll be yours too. - As a former guerilla soldier she knew what she was saying. Thanks to her I took a liking to history, and journalism. Grandma formed me. With her I felt someone noticed me. Because unfortunately Dad was busy with his business. I've lost my ring. You don't wear earrings. It was the ring from my clitoris. Was it really? It's not there anymore. In that solemn atmosphere we're waiting for the holiday Christmas. Everybody got a present. Grandma - a Holy Mother pen. Dad - a 6 month glue supply. Mom - new brakes. Our neighbor - a corkscrew. A double coupon for Cuban oranges. He's not eating anything. - Mom. - Nothing. - Take a fork. - Leave him alone. - Don't force him. - But let him take a fork. You can't play with God's gift. Mom, I'm begging you. Take this one with a Holy Mother. Please, Antek, wait for everybody. Enough of that smoking. Mom! I can leave if I'm bothering anyone. - Stop smoking. - It's Christmas Eve. Hubert. Why aren't you sleeping? - I never do on Christmas Eve, don't you know me? I do. You get your best ideas on Christmas Eve. Exactly I designed 4 kites on Christmas Eves. But none of them flew. - That's our shitty life. - You'll design one that will fly. I know that. - It will fly and fall like all of them. - So what? What matters is that it will fly. Today I remembered how we met. Do you know why? Because I found in the bathroom your earring from the old times. Do you remember? THE LAND OF FUN - What's going on? - Nothing. - Is it about the Christmas Eve? - You could've at least called. I wanted to. Don't talk to me like that. Why? Because I won't give you a present. Stuff it up your ass. I want to stick it in you. Leave it, don't touch it! Look now! I got it! That was my father. Inattentive and disarmingly honest. That's not a good combination especially for a 40-year old woman. Mom felt menopause was approaching and as anyone drowning she was looking for a life ring that my father wouldn't throw to her. Because instead of looking at Mom, he looked at the sky. Krzys! Fuck! That accident was my suicide attempt. I decided to bring my parents together and I chose the simplest way: my own death. Jesus Christ. O God. - What have you done to your kid? - Calm down. We didn't do anything. - You drowned your son? - I didn't drown him. I saved him. - I did. - Is he alive? - Yes! - But he's unconscious. - What were you doing there? You didn't guard your kid by the water? - Mom. My parents didn't understand anything. They were too preoccupied with their problems to see anything. You got all gooey. But that's good. Now you'll find getting to your subconscious much easier. Once we're there maybe you'll change your opinions on many issues. I'd like to change my opinion of my Mom. - What is it now? Not the best. Think that everything good is ahead of you. - I doubt it. - Believe me. Life is full of surprises. - That means...? - That you can change your past. You're joking just to console me? There are more things possible than you think. It's enough to skip your Mom's accident and send your Dad - to the kindergarten meeting. - What will it change? In your head some notion will be born, about your father. Not the best, but it was him, who left his family. You don't have to be gallant towards him. I want to be just. Stop kidding me. Do you want to be just or to get rid of your premature ejaculation? It's enough to erase from your memory your Mom's accident, and I can assure you, that your Dad was ready - to fuck that teacher sideways. - Miss Karolina? My Dad? Don't be a child. For such a stud any girl would be good. You're talking about a deceased person. - Really? Because of him and your Mom you have ejaculatio praecox. Are you still going to defend him? - What do you propose? - A next session on Friday. If you're interested. I was interested quite a lot. I won't deny it, I found the doctor's idea interesting. I had some moral doubts: did I have the right to be the author of my past at the cost of my father? Should I incriminate him in my eyes completely? I was in a dilemma, but also I had in mind my premature ejaculation. Practicality took the upper hand. FAMILY I have my opinions already, but I haven't spoken a word so far. The doctors think it's the result of my drowning. My parents don't have any opinion on that, but to avoid contact with water they chose the mountains, just in case. Very good. You got rid of the wheel chair and it got better right away. I bet after this session you'll have quite good erections. I'm talking about their duration. What a surprise. Hello. - You're on vacation too? - There's no denying. - You were at our meeting. - That's right. A Dad who's involved is a treasure these days. - You're very much alike. - He's the very picture of me. Pleased to meet you. - Hubert Mysliwski. - Karolina. And this is Tadeusz. - Will you stay here long? - 3-4 days. - We'll stay 2 weeks. - How about we get together - for mulled wine? - Great idea. - What about Krzys? - Well, Krzys... It's just him all the time. He's a sound sleeper. He takes it after me. - When he falls asleep... - Does that mean yes? Looks like I have no choice. Miss Karolina and Tadeusz stayed in Zakopane more than 4 days. In that case - congratulations. You've done an unusual thing. You've integrated a family. That's the first step on the way to complete recovery. What will the next one be? In the next one you'll have to achieve more. Which means? Cutting the umbilical cord. When I was 8 I was taken by a police car as a few hours earlier I did something horrible. Are you the boy's father? Yes, I am. - Do you raise him? - No. - Why? - My son is under my wife's custody. We're divorced. Do you have anything to say about his upbringing? - In a limited way. Do you want to add anything? You know... I'm really curious why he set the kindergarten on fire while he goes to school already. You wanted to show off, to impress people. But why did you set fire to the kindergarten and not a tram for that matter? You know we love you. And we're trying to do everything for you. You can end up in a detention center. I understand you're affected by our parting. You got everything at home: a good example, love, a hamster. I can't believe you grew up to be a kindergarten arsonist. Your Mom should kick the shit out of you! Dad finished his speech at that and took a sip of water. Drink, because you're parched. - You live with your son? - Yes. - Did you have any problems with him? - No. Just a moment... We were past this already. - You mean...? - The wheelchair. Do you want our efforts to be lost? What is your relationship with the boy's father? Good enough. Did your son ever try to kill himself? No. Should he? It's my fault. All this is an effect of a tragic coincidence. My son is irresponsible. We've had problems with him for years, but let's give him a chance. He might be useful to society. If we imprison him, he'll become a tattooed criminal. For the first time I felt in control. Arson changed it all. If I had known this before, I'd burn the whole city. Then comes my favorite part of the evening. It was dawn when my dad went to his new family. For my Confirmation, I got a bike. A Russian one. I decided to hurt myself - to spite my dad. Your vision will be poor for some time, son. How is your sight? To hurt your head like this... Sonny... You're a ball of fire. You could use the energy better. And do what? It's just an idea. Maybe I'm old, maybe I'm wrong. You're wrong, Mother. As usual. It's Krzysio's Confirmation day. Let's not be unpleasant. - OK. - OK? Maybe we should discuss the political situation? - My intentions were good. - But the result is shitty. You should go to your tramp and not spoil our holiday. I hope this will make you a man. Whatever that means. I am not a religious man, but you need to have faith. Even if it's faith in socialism or the other thing. Whatever is the situation in our country or any other country of the Warsaw Pact... I love you, remember this. Remember this. Spoiled our confirmation. What a fool! These were Granny's last words. And I didn't even see her properly. One week later she was dead. GRANNY To our Mom! - Everything tastes good? - Yes. - She did it her way, unlike us. - What do you mean? Work, duties, no pleasure, just day after day. You always had time to fool around. Is it worse now? I'm not young anymore. A baby at my age... You know. - It's too much for me. - It always was. - But you were always there for me. - It was your choice. Sometimes Mrs. Karolina would surprise my Mom and bring her daughter. She didn't have any wings, but she liked to walk barefooted. On the way home I tried to remember, was Miss Karolina's dress blue or red, when I met her for the first time? If I'm wrong, if it was red, I need to tell the story again, because the color is very important. Old buildings are better. There's no space here. - It's enough for us. - What about the kids? We're students. We don't plan any kids. I didn't plan either. It's not our decision. - Want a cookie? - No, thanks. - What are the electricity costs? - Average. - You'll come to me, when they'll grow. - Why should they? - Why not? - We'll be okay. - What will you do? - I'll start working. Want to quit studying? - I'm not quitting anything. - Moron. My child, you won't have an easy life with him. Even if you think now that you're happy. One day, nothing will be left. - Are you sick? - I'm perfectly well. It's just great. That's how my problems started. It was all finished before I started. Then, some time passed. I was full of hope, it was going well, and suddenly it was all wrong. I was never given the third chance. - What about Kasia? - She dumped me. - I'm not surprised. - Neither am I. - Was there anyone after that? - I returned to my Mom's - and lived with her for 18 years. - Quite a lot. - Were you getting along? - At times. - Did you tell her of your problems? - No, of course not. So why did you wait with coming to me until now? - Now I have fallen in love. - You don't say! Even a blind monkey finds a banana sometimes. Keep talking. I fell in love with the daughter of my kindergarten teacher. - The barefooted girl? Can't be! - It is. If we stick to our theory, you love the daughter of your Mom's girlfriend. Exactly. And because of this, or thanks to this, your conscience is ejaculating, so to say. Nicely said. Now we got it. You were castrated. Some mothers castrate their sons to have them for themselves. That's why you suffer from the ejaculatio praecox. A good son doesn't protest. He loves his mother just the way she is. And all this because we want to be independent. Nice... There's only one cure for this. You need to go back to your childhood and work on a problem. - What problem? - You need to seduce your teacher. What? You need to fuck her. THE NEW LAND My father had two kids with his second wife. But when he was dying, they were in Greece. On vacation. You're done. Do you know you're dying? I know. - Sad? - No. Are you sad that you left us? I never left you. That's my problem. - Couldn't have you both. - That's what you wanted. Bullshit! Bullshit! - Everything could be different. - We are what we do. Alright. I know my truth. - We never understood each other. - Maybe that's why I love you. But it's not the time to get soft. - We need to say goodbye. - Go on... What's your last wish? Tell me... Is your pussy still hungry? Age is not a factor, I thought you knew. - It's surprisingly beautiful. - Only one thing on your mind. - Also, glue is important. - And paper. No, not the blotting paper. I know now why the kites didn't fly. You know? If I could have another go, I'd use some other materials. Last will You've traded your hamster for comic books and you think it was a good decision? You think you're tough? You're not. This was the biggest mistake in your life. You've chosen creativity. Over the feelings you had for a living creature. I just hope you won't be sorry. It was great. I think I'm in love. I think I'm in love. She's the best girl I ever had. All of Hubert Mysliwskis property, including the apartment on Gertuda Street, 130 square meters, house left to him by his parents, 250 square meters, and a large supply of pine wood of the finest quality, used for building premium kites, which is worth 700000 zloty, is left by his will to his first wife and his oldest son. I was able to buy a new penthouse. I put a hamster cage in my living room, but I didn't buy a hamster. I didn't want to decide by myself what age, color and sex it should be. So I waited. I was waiting for the guest of honor, my second half of the apple. I was sure I'd meet the right person and we would adopt a little hamster. And I'll prove my father wrong. I didn't trade my feelings for comic books. I've made some other mistakes, but not this one. Since I'm a writer, I could write a story like this. My name is Krzysztof Mysliwski. And my mother? She regained her joy of life, that she kind of lost lately.
