Stop it Stop it Stop it Subtitles Nostromo Mr. Poe! Mr. Poe! Are you all right, Mr. Poe? Yes yes I...I'm all right - Edgar... - Carl! Carl, please, in the drawer...Please... Thank you No,please let me have it. Edgar, why won't you send me for a doctor No! I'm all right - If there is anything you need. - Yes. Yes, I'll send for you. What can I get you? A beer. Would you like to buy me a drink? Small cognac for a nice girl? My name is Elsie. Would you like to dance? Ah, you're shy,exactly?Come on! Good Morning Mrs. Marlow. - Good Morning - Good morning, Mr. Marsh. I see that you have someone new in the house Miss Clare.Moved in yesterday. She looks like a nice lady. - Miss Clare? - That's right. Miss Betty Clare. You know her? No, no... She works near here,does she? The florist down near the square. I see. Thank you. Good Morning Good Morning,Sir - Good Morning - What was you had in mind? A bunch of roses perhaps? - Or a buttonhole? - Yes..., yes, a buttonhole. Is this... Can I help you,Sir? A buttonhole perhaps? But... how do you get to know a girl? How do you get to know a girl? I think it's the easiest thing in the world! - How? - You got somebody in mind? How? Tell me how Well, it's hard to say, it depends on the girl, the place and many things. Suppose Suppose she lives just across the street but you've never met her. It's easy You wait for her to appear you step forward you rise your hat and you say: "How do you do?". - For no reason? - Well, she lives across the street she's a neighbor,one talks one's neighbors Yes, yes, I suppose so but... what would you say? Well,either small talk such: "What a pleasant day!" That kind of thing. Or the direct approach come right out in the open tell her that you think she's attractive and you want her to dine with you - You make it sounds very easy - But it's easy, Edgar! Look here, what is all this? Are you thinking of finding a certain girl? Suppose... suppose she rebuffs you? Slaps your face right out there in the street? Oh, yes, that's the risk. But is one usually worth taking I'm walking this way I wonder if you don't mind Didn't I see you at the flower shop yesterday? Of course I don't mind,Mr Marsh -Oh may I? -Not very heavy -Oh -Thank you May I see you again? We're neighbours No I meant Perhaps that we could meet for dinner sometime - Yes, I'd like that - Tonight? How about tonight? - I work late - I can meet you here. I thought... perhaps, we could go to that little restaurant on the square Very well. - At eight - Thank you... I was very lucky too I got work in the florist the day after I arrived But then I've been doing all the talking I like listening to you. Now it's your turn Well, I work as a librarian In charge of the reference section in the main library Is that all? I can't think of anything else to say What do you do with your spare time? Oh I... I play chess, mostly Carl Loomis and I Carl is a friend of mine,you'd like him,everybody likes Carl - Who else lives in your house? - No one. You live alone? In that big old house? - Surely not - I prefer it that way Would you like to dance? - No,I'd sooner not - I don't mind if It's getting a bit late after all I think I ought to take you home Yes,thanks Thank you.Good Night Good night, Edgar.It's been a lovely evening. The stairwell is very dark. May I see you to your door? Thank you. The landlady doesn't believe in wasting light She turns them all out at 10 30 Thank you, Edgar. I think I'll be safe now Betty! Betty, I'm sorry, I... - Can I help you, Madam? - I think you can go now, Betty. Thank you Madam. Betty! You must forgive me for last night. Please,let me see you again If only just for one drink together I... I'm sorry, Betty. Well Perhaps one drink then Good night, Edgar. Uh... are you doing anything tomorrow night? I was wondering whether we could do something rather special It's Saturday night, you wouldn't have to go to work the following day Perhaps we could.. Perhaps have dinner somewhere, or go somewhere and dance together Or have you some other engagement? No other. I'll come with you, Edgar You know,you're the prettiest girl here Everybody admires you. I,I've been here quite often Always on my own So crowded Do you suppose we could have a drink? Oh yes...Of course. Oh waiter! What we'll have? Champagne? How about champagne? -Well -Waiter,champagne,the best you have We must come here again Saturday perhaps,how about next Saturday? Well, on Saturday, I... There are so many things that I want to enjoy with you. I never realized how wonderful it is to... share something. It's Carl! You remember, I told you about him Carl! Here's our table over there Over here Pardon me a moment I'll be right back Don't be too long Hello I did not expect to see you here! Carl, I want you to meet a great friend of mine. Betty Clare, Carl Loomis. I told her so much about you Good evening. I've looked forward meeting you,Mr. Loomis. Carl! He's my best friend! That's right, I'm his best friend This is wonderful! I just ordered some champagne -You will stay and have a drink -I'm sorry, I'm dining with people Bring them over There are too many of them and they are a little drunk Oh,it's ridiculous! You can't just go like that - Just a few minutes,one drink. - Yes, please do,Carl. That settles it,he's never been known to refuse a lady - Very well one drink. - Wonderful That was when I was half way off to America I settle down then A first class rolling stone to a second rate scientist... I've got an awful lot to catch up on - But don't you miss the excitement? - A little. But it wasn't all adventure, you know! Hard work most of the time! Same I wish I've done it! And me too. But you could,Edgar.There's nothing to keep you here now It's easy to wander when you got no one to come back to - I must be with my party - Oh, no, not yet,sure I thought you'd ask me to dance, Carl. Yes do,Carl, dance with her, go on -Go on Carl -Very well Very strange that you and Edgar were such good friends. Why strange? You are so different. Edgar is a decent sort He's got me out of a spot more than once. I like this place. There are better places I haven't been in town long enough to know them. No more than a week. Yes... So Edgar said I've been working too hard to get around much I work in the florist's On the square Thank you. Another drink, Carl. No, thank you, really,I must get back to my party now -Good night,Miss Clare. -Good night,Edgar. Good night, Carl... Same time, tomorrow? Yes. - So what did you think of him? - I like him very much. I knew you would,everybody likes Carl. Have some champagne... What did you mean then, "same time,tomorrow?" We always spend Sundays together He comes to lunch and then we play chess. Betty, you look beautiful. Really beautiful What shall we drink to? You propose a toast To a successful evening! To a successful evening That's it I'm afraid,now your Queen's gone Two more moves and checkmate Another? No thank you.Two beatings are quite enough for me. You, uh... You haven't said a word about last night yet Don't you think she's beautiful, Carl? She is very attractive It's... She's little easy to talk to, to be with You know what I am like usually with women. Petrified that I should do the wrong thing but it's not like that with Betty. I feel that I can relax with her. Don't let your heart run away with you, Edgar. What I mean is It would be foolish to get in too deep with this girl. -Why? -She's new in town ... she's anxious to make friends! - That's lucky for me,isn't it? She is also your first real girlfriend. The first one always goes to a man's head No,no,no... There will be other girls You'll see Not for me. Just be sure Edgar,that's all! - Don't lose your hopes too high - We have the same interests. Did I tell you? I lent her a copy of Ovid and her reactions were exactly the same as mine And that's rare in a woman,isn't it? I mean a woman as gay and lovely as Betty. Excuse me,Sir,there's a young lady to see you. -A Miss Clare. - Betty! Show her in! Betty Edgar, Carl... I didn't mean to disturb you, but I wanted to return your book. I remember how cautious you were about of letting it out of your sight! Thank you. - Well, both I'd better go. - Well,... ... now that you're here,won't stay and have a drink? No, I didn't mean to intrude on your game. Nonsense, we've just finished,haven't we,Carl? Yes, yes, we've just finished Are you sure? I wouldn't dream of letting you go now Please. Well, in that case... Oh,I'm going to show you the line sketching by Nero(?) There are overt fifty of them you see What are you playing? Very pretty Oh,he's only teasing you.He can play much better than that. How about it,Carl? What about that piece "Smudges" Please. Splendid! I must go home, I've got some reading to catch up on And I must get up early. Thank you, Edgar. It's been a perfect evening. It was perfect for me too. -I'll see you,Edgar -When? How about tomorrow evening? I'm free. Well,Betty and I were already going out to dinner - Why don't you join us, Carl. - Oh, no, thank you... -You know,that's an excellent idea! -Well,no.. You already said you were free You know you don't like spending evenings alone - I'll find something to do. - Why bother,when we are going anyway Very well.Tomorrow then. I... -I'll see you home. - No, Edgar, it's much too late. Besides,I only live across the street I'm sure Carl will see me to my door Good night, Edgar. Good night Good Bye Good Bye Carl Good Night This one,Sir That's easy to arrange I'll have it mounted for you - How long will it take? - Give me till tomorrow? Fine Excuse me sir. I would prefer something in advance,if you don't mind Yes indeed... - Shall we deliver it for you? - No,no,I'll pick it up in the morning. -Thank you -Thank you Can I help you? - The very best you have. - Yes,Sir Something else to celebrate, Edgar? Perhaps,perhaps - Are you enjoying yourself? - Very much Carl, darling!What of that wicked..? I'm with friends, Jane. Go away... Go away! To the finest people I know! The finest, and one of the finest evenings Watch that drink Quot."When we do not have those we love, we must love those we have. " Montaigne.A fine writer. A fine writer for a fine evening. It's late, Edgar. I said,"It's late!"I'd like to go. Ah certainly I'll go and get our coats You didn't dance with me whole evening,Carl Tonight. Betty Since that last time I haven't - Betty... - No... Edgar. It's late.I am very tired. Yes of course...I am sorry. Good night, Edgar. I'd better go I mustn't been seen here by anybody Is that Edgar you're worried about ? Yes, I'm worried about Edgar. - You said you loved me, Carl. - I do, Betty. No other woman never had this effect on me,I do love you Why worry about Edgar? Why did you go out with him? I don't know... I'm a stranger here,I don't know anyone! - I suppose I felt sorry for him - That's just it He is a bit pitied,so he invites pity! I told you. - He doesn't own me, Carl. - Nobody wants to For a man like Edgar,it's all that matters You mean a great deal to him,Betty. And to you? How do you suggest? I'll break to him gently. I'll tell him that we have fallen in love and we are going to get married. He is intelligent man you understand. You got to understand! I couldn't get here any sooner, what's the matter with him,Mrs Vine? He hasn't left his room. He asked me to send for you and wait and let you in. - He is upstairs. - Have you sent for a doctor? He wouldn't let me All right you can go now, thank you,Mrs Vine You waken late enough as it is I am staying,Sir,do you think there is anything I can do. No thank you.I can take care of things You know I never been upstairs in this house before,which is his room? - It's on top of the stairs. - Thank you very much. - Edgar? Edgar? The door is unlocked - Edgar,what's wrong? - Come in,Carl, come in. What's the matter? Are you sick? Sick, yes,kind of sickness So I don't wonder sitting here with no fire No light on soon this place will look a bit more cheerful... No! No light. Edgar, you got to pull yourself out of this Pour me a drink will you On the table,by the window. You must get out of here. Sitting in one room all the time isn't doing you any good I like this room. Lean and tranquil And the view is to be admired Yes, Carl. I know! But Carl wouldn't go away not just like that without telling me If you would pardon me, Miss Claire, that may have been exactly the idea What do you mean? We checked at Mr. Loomis's apartment. He was well known to his landlady and indeed the whole district to be a rather wild young man sowing plenty of wild oats Carl wouldn't do this to me Something happened to him. - An accident. - We checked the hospitals too. I shouldn't worry too much It's not the first time it's happened Twice before Mr. Loomis has been away on a discrete holiday To escape an unhappy gambling debt another time a woman And you won't do anything? There is nothing I can do If however you bring me further information something more definite Mr. Marsh. Betty! - Have you heard anything? - No. I've just come from the police station. - What did they say? - The same as you. That Carl has gone away like this before You are showing a great deal of concern for him I do not like to think that anything happened to him. It's been three days now, Edgar. Are you sure he said nothing to you? Carl didn't confide in me completely you know He can look after himself. I see you tonight. We can walk home together? There's a circus in town I wonder whether perhaps later on Not tonight, Edgar.I am very tired. - Perhaps another time. - All right. - Some other time - Good night! Take all the time you want... All the time you want I can be patient Soon she must come to me. She must.. come to me. Oh my God... Mrs. Vine! - What are you doing? - Try to clean the lounge,Sir - But the door is blocked. - It is locked! You were right when you said that this house was far too big for just one person. So I decided to dispense with some of the rooms. - That door will remain locked - But I must at least dust,Sir I said it would remain locked As you wish,Sir. Are you all right,Sir? The other evening, when Mr. Loomis arrived I should never have troubled him I was all right He only stayed for a few moments Stop it. Stop it Then you must have seen us! Then you must have seen us! Yes, Monday evening Mr. Marsh wasn't very well that night. In fact, he has not been himself for some days now He asked you to take a note to Mr. Loomis? - Yes. - Do you know what was in the note? I'm not in the habit of reading other people's letters But I think he was to ask him to come here straight away Anyway Mr. Loomis did arrive that evening Mr. Loomis was here? - Monday night? - Yes. Now look,Miss... I shouldn't be telling you all this only you said you wanted to help Mr Marsh Yes... I think he is a very sick man I do want to help him. Please, Mrs. Vine,don't tell him I was here. - Not yet. - Very well Miss. My dear Miss Clare, your accusations... are entirely without foundations But Carl Loomis went to Edgar Marsh's house that evening! What if he did? Why hasn't Edgar said anything to me about it? Perhaps he wanted to spare your feelings! We spoke to Mr. Marsh, you know. He has known Mr. Loomis for years He's got him out of many straights in the past It's possible that Loomis went there to borrow money. Marsh haven't mentioned it, because... Well,one doesn't mention that kind of thing You don't know Edgar Marsh. He could be insanely jealous His mind could be twisted Edgar Marsh has worked quietly as chief librarian in this town for many years A thoroughly respectable citizen No, no, no, Miss Clare... You don't want to find Carl Loomis,do you? I don't want to persecute an innocent man! Some women never want to admit that they've been thrown over Not even to themselves. Do you think there might be something in what she says? Do you? Yes sir. - A cognac, please. - Right now. -And some cigars. -Yes It's just an ordinary poker Then why hide it in his bedroom when there is no fire?Why hide it? Look here, Miss,there may be a dozen explanations I demand that you search that house! Can't do that not without the Inspector's authority - Then find him - He's on a case just now. I'll tell you what we'll do though I'll make sure he sees this as soon as he gets back. Bishop... Bishop move Check me King moves Check me. Try again, try again... It's no good.. I can't win Checkmate. Checkmate Checkmate Checkmate,checkmate,checkmate,checkmate No... No There's no way of convincing that woman I told her that you'd contact her as soon as you got back,Sir Morning will be soon enough Here,put this away somewhere. Wait a minute... Here Dried blood. We are closed. Hello Deary - Any sign? - The street is empty, sir. I don't see why you are waiting Why don't you just break in and search the house? That's the not the way we do things, Miss Clare. Suspicion is one thing,evidence is another You need evidence to break into a man's home Mr. Marsh will come back,and then we'll ask him some questions And if he doesn't come back,what then? We can talk about that later Inspector! - Betty... - Good morning, Mr. Marsh. You look as you had rather a rough night I've... Betty... I know it's very early to call, Mr. Marsh, but I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you do not mind. Shall we go inside? Inside? Right so,we don't want to stand out here,do we? Well,Sir,where shall we go? In here? No! In there. In the study. You sit down,Sir I'll stand if you don't mind but you sit down! Edgar,we want to know about Carl. Just a matter of routine,Sir You see,there is a possibility that our first ideas about. the disappearance of Mr. Loomis may well have been inaccurate. You see you neglected to tell us he was here that Monday evening Indeed,the information to suggest that you asked him to come here send for him in fact Now is that true,Sir? I was sick.I asked him to come For any particular reason,Sir? I wanted him to bring me some things Some personal things How long was Mr. Loomis here that evening,Sir? I'm sorry... I didn't quite hear that I said, how long was Mr. Loomis here that evening? - I... I do not know... I... -Come,come, Mr. Marsh. You must be able to have a guess How long was Mr. Loomis here that evening ? Ten minutes! Ten minutes. Did anyone see him leave here? I don't know! I don't know! Just one or two more routine questions. What did you and Mr. Loomis talk about that evening? Come now you must remember what you spoke about... Mr. Marsh,I insist that you answer my questions Mr Marsh,Mr Marsh You know,don't you? You know! You can hear it,can't you You can hear it! Hear what? The beatings of his heart! The beatings of his infernal heart! He is... he is buried in there. But... his heart keeps beating. I can't stop it! His heart is beating I can't stop it! Heart from beating Marsh! Edgar!Edgar Carl! Oh Carl Are you all right? You've been screaming loud enough to pull the house down Yes, I'm all right now. I had a nightmare. - A terrible nightmare. - Can I get you something? No... no,I'm fine now. It must have been quite a nightmare Yes, yes,it was You were there Carl. And I was in it too except that I had a limp. And And there was Subtitles Nostromo
