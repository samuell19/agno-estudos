FLAMES OVER TREASURES AFTER THE WORKS OF IOAN AGARBICEANU Hey!Let's get down and see the flag! Look up.Look! Can't, I get dizzy. Why don't you come clean? Who put the flag up there? And on the Iancu's cross? (Avram Iancu, the hero of Transylvania) My respects!What's bothering you, Visalon? Your student ate my bread! Why do you mean? Vasile, my favorite student? He and other two friends. I don't know their names. Because of those three I lost my job, but I said nothing with all that beating. Must have been them who put the flags. You think it was them? The other night they got me drunk on brandy. Beats me how I even got home... So I forgot all about the keys! Mind you, Visalon. Suspicion is a sin I'll see to it that you get another job. Thanks a lot, professor. Muresan, Mircea and Bogdan must go to the teacher's room. Wow!I feel dizzy! "Acta non verba"(Facts, not words) Good day.Good day. Visalon came to me yesterday. There's nothing to fear. He'll stay mute, as he did when the gendarmes beat him. What if he'll get drunk again? Yes, it's true! Starting today you'll go on holiday. Get out of town quickly. Go to your village or even further. Keep in touch with me, and later, when things cool down.. They still didn't get it down! We tied it fine, professor! My, how stupid he is! Watch out! My regards!My regards, director! Welcome! The people at Arhanghelii still can rustle up some gold. Who touches the honey, licks his fingers. He licks, but can also kick the bucket! Stop drinking, Erotei! Let us drink, for when we die we can't get drunk anymore. Well, if a guy is dead is dead, and he's alive he's alive.... It's not good for a poor man to be silent, because he starts thinking. Wine! The good one! What, we sell rotgut here? I don't know, I haven't been here in ages. I bet one zlot! One zlot! That's how it is with Rodean's mine at Arhanghelii! Only who knows nothing about it may think it's a blessing. They cut into gold like into wax! Death will always take one, there 's one that bites the dust from time to time... That's Marza One evening he told me he saw a flame over the mountain. And from that flame let out a voice that cried "Gold! Gold! Rubbish! Rubbish?He knows more about gold than all of us. He has seen the spirit of the mine! He sniff the gold as the dog sniff the bone! He lives for it!That's why he never married. That's the man I told you about. Now, go! If you have some gold drop by our desk. What, you're a miner, too? Yes, miner. You don't look like one, to tell you the truth. What's your name? Marza. So, Marza, tell me, there's no more gold? There is, but... I can't find it. If you did, you'd be rich like Rodean and that'll suit you mighty fine, wouldn't you? I want to dig out my own gold with my own hands, not steal from others. But what do you know about digging out gold? Why should I tell you about that? Even if I didn't, I'd go to a place and bring three kilos in a single night. So you know about where to find gold? Go have your plum brandy and come back tonight when we can talk calmly. Come through the back, use the old gate. Let's drink this for director Rodean! Wish him to dig lots of gold from the Arhanghelii mine that he.. Thank you for the book and for the dedication. It wasn't a dedication, it was a sentence. I felt humiliated, I wrote it with a bad intent. And why did you feel humiliated? Because the way you and your father cross the street. Pitty you don't know me better, mr Muresanu. The fortune doesn't interest me. As you wrote, it's in ourselves that we seek true happiness. Tell me, it was you who put up flags? What flags? I was sure it had to be you who hoisted them Who's "you"? You three, you and your buddies. You're always seen together in town! I'd like to introduce you.. He is.. Vasile Muresanu.A future university student. What will you study, mr Muresanu? Philosophy or letters. You mean words, words to get to the people dizzy. Better get dizzy with the wine, because the words, as they say.. Hey, come over here! Come here! Yes, director. Do you know how much wine you still have? What kind of merchant should I be? It's all mine! Pull the plugs, let the wine flows! This wine is for tomorrow and after tomorrow! Give it to the folks to drink, jackass! Yes. Director Rodean is buying!Long life to him! I can't stand this cage anymore! Change your dress and cut out the nonsense! I'm fed up with being shut up in this house! I can't take it anymore! You're here, Marza? Come in! Excuse me to welcome you this way.. but I stayed at the desk all day and my feet are killing me. Marza, nobody has heard any of what I'll tell you now. What can I do if I care about you? You're smarter than any miner. Take the keys and open the money safe! Now, go! Those are maps drawn up by a man who passed away. I bought them with the pub. Many years ago, here the things weren't quite straight, dear Marza. It's here that all gold thieves used to meet. Now, when they steal a few grams of gold they think they've made a lucky strike.. At that time, they took no less than 1 kg. Over here there're gold mines known for ages. How do you want to make the deal? By three or by half? First of all, can you read the map? Sure, you didn't pick me for nothing. All right. Fifty-fifty, Marza! Good day! Good day. My, my, what guests! Bogdan and Mircea. Welcome.Good to see you. Come on. Come inside! No, no! We need to talk. What's up? Since you left the've been searching the whole town. They found out we hoisted the flags. How?I don't know.Word's spread. They looked for us home but we went into hiding. Something happened to Professor Pascu? The gendarmes held him up a whole day. If they did that to him, it means to us.. Brother Vasile, we'll cross the mountains, to Bucharest. Surely we'll find someone to guide us to Cucului custom. This is the first thing. Tell him the second one. Want to come with us? The three of us would be great. Coming? I'll be a teacher. My father knows a few hamlets far away, in the mountains. Nobody will look for me there. Yes, it's beautiful. I buy it. I'll pay now, I have money on me. Mr Rodean, there is no hurry. We'll draw the papers up at the bank. Anyhow, nobody can match your offer. My dear, the competition doesn't matter. I've married my eldest daughter! Hey, there are plenty of things more beautiful than gold! Look around you! The sky, the clouds, the sun! Look.. Tell me the name of a rich man from the time of Avram Iancu.. as rich as it is Rodeanu in our times. Even in Iancu's time must have been blokes who wanted to have a gold statue for themselves, don't you think? Why did Iancu stay in our hearts? Because he died poor! What did all the rich men from his time leave behind? There are things more precious than gold! I don't deny it, only that I want to feel it in my hand, to see it with my own eyes! I feel it inside.That's where my wealth is. The blazing spirit of the mine! We've been walking for three days and we're still not there? Good day. Good day. You're ready, gentlemen? We'll pay you.. No pay, no pay. I did all this for the man who taught me to read and write, his father. I'll go on the first road. When you'll hear shooting, you can get going. They'll be after me. So, (young) sir, you dare come with me? Right under your house, mr Rodean, some 30, 40 meters away I think you can strike the same gold mines you showed me yesterday. Yes, it's possible, counselor. They say they were digging up a well and that rubble, grounded..turned into gold! Yes, but here there are phreatic waters, Mr Rodean. Sandy soil. Water will prevent any digging of galleries. Anyhow, I read somewhere that in this area there's also native gold. discovered first by the dacians and the romans. I had no idea you're good at geology, too. Guess we should go. If you stick aroundd a few more days, you'll go into prospecting as well! Damn this job! When you're that stuck to a desk, life isn't worth living! After all, you stay more in the 24 karat salon than at the desk Bussiness dear, bussiness. More difficult than in an office! Isn't it, father in law? One can win such sums! Ma, let's take some pictures! Yes.Yes.Ghita, come on! No! I'll stand by my sisters. Perfect!A little more.. Smile! Got to go, it's late. I'd like a word with mr Rodean. Yes, sure, I'll be waiting by the coach Director, time is pressing, so.. I suppose your son in law has appraised you of the reason for my visit. Yes, counselor. It's my privilege , sir, to ask the hand of your daughter. It's true that so far I cannot say I know how she feels about this, but I believe she won't turn me down. We are agreeable and glad ... I hope the girl will also say yes. So we know where we stand in this matter. It's all clear now. Allow me, director One aspect has indeed been clarified but not the second. This is the second: I want her dowry to be 80.000 delivered to me at the wedding in a deposit book. You want to receive 80.000 on your wedding day? Then I'll have to ask you something. Leave this place at once! You tell me, the owner of the Arhanghelii mine how much dowry should I give to my daughter? To me, who I have in my pocket the mountain, the village, the miners every single path crosses my yard. You're afraid that I don't have money? Counselor, I like to give money not to be asked to! What an impudence! I don't want you to see you anymore! And let me tell you something else: Here only God is richer than me! But only by a single coin! Boys, God doesn't cotton to fools! My brother, I'll won't ever tail that man, be sure of that. Good day, teacher! Uncle Simion, I'm going down to the village. Tomorrow morning I'll be back. Don't go,sir.A week ago the gendarmes looked for you. Someone could spot you. One Judas? That's sinful talk, teacher. You find a Judas in town, not here with us. Good evening, dad.Welcome. Didn't anybody say you? They looked for me again? I'll be leaving tomorrow at dawn. You've seen Ilenuta? I'll never see her again. Look, from Bogdan and from Mircea. You wrote to them? Whenever someone crossed the mountains. When did they look for me? They prowled around, better said Look, this is the real title! (THE HYSTORY OF THE ROMANIANS) (Nicolae) Iorga used a different one to fool the custom's agents. Please sent it to Professor Pascu, from Blaj. He lent it to me. I made three copies of it. When?Where did you find such patience? I found and I will find again.. Non si può fare a meno. Is there not a single man among all these women? What's come over you? You're all stiffened. Or there's some feast and I ignore it? Who doesn't get down with me into the vortex will be fired. The "women" stay home! Follow me, lads! Ok, boys.somebody's got to go in the vortex. I say it was the Blazing spirit... ...it warned us and then left.It did his job! Uncle, this time the guards are to blame, forget it. Nobody entered the mine.We won't go in! Look, I'll go bring Marza. He's not afraid of the mine spirit. Right, tell him we give him whatever he wants. Go! Erotei, take the horse!Go! We need a long rope and a brave man. A man is dying at the bottom of the vortex. The guards watched always. I tell you, somebody is dying down there. Look for a long rope to tie him. He can't be carried. The vortex is unleashed, the stairs are weak... Have it your way.I sent for Marza. He'll be here soon to go into the vortex. Director, now perhaps you'll stop the works. We found nothing.It's swallowed so much money. Now it's taken a man's life, too! That one is not human! It's a thief! You shouldn't talk such nonsense in front of the miners. Excuse me, director, it's no nonsense. We're spending so much money, perhaps you don't care. But , I, who am your partner, have a lot of heartaches. You've always complaining of being poor. Take care, Pruncu, what you fear most will get you in the end! I'll go. too. Come on, man! It's clear this man knows the blazing spirit! He knows the devil! Man! Blazing spirit, you say? Pull the rope! Too late! Director.. Let's accept we worked for nothing digging so far 300 meters in this rock. Let's say we lost but let's not go forward You'll end your money, too, director. Me? If you think so, I don't need any partner You can leave. All right, director, I'll leave at once. But let me tell you that from the first of the month I'm out. If you want to hang yourself, I can't stop you! To whom will you sell your share? Who bids the most, director. Who bids the most?Then it's mine. He died a short time ago.He was still warm! Marza, nobody has seen you in the village for a month. Why spite the mine guards? They'll get you in the end! Nobody gets me! Not even God! How much do you want? Nothing, director.I came to save a man. He's not a man, he is a thief! That's how gold is, director.It's not a job. it's a hunt! They are getting him out! Who is he? Grigoras Barbu You can't be friend with a poor one, this is the reason that the people die Grigoras, man, what have you done? Who pushed you? Grigoras!Grigoras, my son! You killed him! Bastards! May God dry up all the gold in the Arhanghelii, mr Rodeanu! I've told you gentlemen, not to waste time chasing wild geese in my villages How come you're not speaking the government language? Gendarme, obviously you're new around. Over here we talk gold's language. Soon, you will learn it , too. Teacher... Sit down. Once the holiday over, you'll have to bring in plants, together with some verses who can suite them. As this one: "Green fir boughs, mighty and proud, Iancu's weapons cry out loud" because rain and snow fall upon them and nobody use them".All right? We are agreed? Are you sleeping? Come on! Let me be! Leave me alone!I've water in my shoes! I sent you five letters and you replied to none. I just can't! Come on! I read some of your stuff.What? A notebook whith the history of the Romanians. Why haven't you come down to us? And have the gendarmes on me?The'll never catch you. Why? I told father about you yesterday. Do you know what he said when the gendarmes asked him? "We don't have revolutionaries,gentlemen". Don't say! "We have only gold and gold is what we all miss" He said that! Sure?Fine! Don't be mean, anyway you've got to talk to... I'm slipping! I'll come one night with a new moon, and I'll take you with me on one condition... No dowry! Only with the dress I have on me? No! I'll come with a sack, undress you and then marry you It's gold? Yes. Who's the girl? A young lady brought up in Vienna. You know her?No, father in law, but if you want.. Marcu, when it comes to women, I need no lawyers. Good evening, director. Cards, Marcu! Come, Muntene, come, Muntene, do the honors: 24 karats! No! Don't be stingy for you'll go broke just the same! Full! If you're run out of cash, go to the bank. Come on, cards! Mr Rodean, is it true that you want to floor your house with gold coins? They say you sent a request in this sense to our good emperor, Franz Iozsef. He turned you down? No, he approved on condition the coins were placed in edge. so that nobody step on the face of the too gracious sovereign... See why playing cards is so good? In an hour I can take from you of as much as you skin from others in a year. It's yours, Mr Rodean. Keep it, lad!I have no use for it. Neither do I, director.I'd rather have this. What?You mess up with me? Yes, director. The collar is such a nuissance, isn't it? Not bad, not bad, but...more! It's enough.You can take one back. Let it be, director, anyway they return tu me. You didn't do the right thing, lad. Women, like gold, stick to the winner. Everything on a single game? What's on the table could pay the miners'wages for a year. Stay healthy, Marza! There's enough gold in this world... for both of us! Got quite a pile, Marza!You're something! You know what? I'd marry you. You agree or not? I wanted to ask you.. The first night I came here I saw a beautiful girl. Who are his parents? You want her,don't you? A man who stays unmarried to my age knows too well what he wants. Whose girl is she? Mine. Mine, Marza, mine.. Yours? Ok, take her. I'll give her to you if you go after gold one more time! To the most secluded and rich place! You've got enough for the dowry. Her dowry, yes! How about mine? Go one more time after gold and we've got a deal. Father, I 've got my appointment. As of July 1, I'll be a mine engineer. With the little german that I speak I hope I'll manage somewhere in Slovakia. Better see what's this! You'll regret all your like to have turned down my offer... To stay here and become general manager. I think I'm doing the right thing, and I don't regret it. It has no gold. Not a bit. Father, it's been a long time I wanted to tell you something that worries me. What? To avoid serious financial troubles, you really got to shut down the new gallery. You already covered 400 meters. You may go ten times deeper and still you won't find any gold. The direction is wrong. In the last months you spent... 20 to 30 thousands zlots. And there will be other months like these. God, what nonsense. Tell me, this is all that you want to tell me? No.There's more. You gave Maria a splendid dowry. You have only 50 thousands zlots left in your deposits. Dad, why don't you try to reason? You want Ilenuta to be without a dowry? You're mad!My boy, don't you see? In a few weeks, maybe even days we'll find the good rock in the new gallery. So, this way you'll ask Ilenuta to marry you? Yes. Drink up, lad, to pluck up courage! Boy! Boy... My foot! Don't go to ask, but to take! Not that way, (young) sir, this way. My regards, substitute teacher. How could I thank you for...the great honor you do to me? You may find surprising what I'll tell you, director. Not at all. Go ahead. Get out. I'm not the one to be caught by surprise.Never. I'd be extremely happy if you allowed miss Ilenuta to be my lawful wife. Don't worry, no dowry. Come again? You're hard of hearing? Not at all.I hear fine. But I've the impression you're mistaken about the name. Guess you didn't mean Ilenuta but Uta. My dear, Uta is neither my daughter nor a miss. It's the servant that showed you in. You can ask for her hand.. No! ...without dowry! You got me wrong.I haven't come to ask, but to take her! Get out! I won't! Get out! I won't! Get the hell out through the back door, by the stables, not on the front door! I told you I'll marry her without any dowry! Uta, the substitute teacher wants to marry you... Not Uta, Ilenuta! Don't let me catch you here again or I'll break your bones! Director, a man wants to see you. What man?From the Arhanghelii. What's the matter, Erotei? Anybody got killed by the mine? Director.. Come on, talk! We struck the ancient gallery! Come again! We stumbled on a Roman gallery! Get out! You stink like a corpse, old jackass! My regards! There are at most 12 meters to the surface. 12 and a half. So you studied it!Yes! A Roman gallery! Damn old man! How could they work so beautifully? Shut up, he's coming! We can't change lots, mr Rodean Lots are cast for everyone. I had these signs for weeks. The room gave an empty sound. The blazing spirit was beckoning! It was ever so hard to decide who to go in first. In the end we drew lots. Four people died? Didn't get the time to die, they were torn to pieces! Then why you didn't all die blast you to hell? What do you want? What, you want to live, don't you? Why live animals? You have a taste for life I'll show you life! You saw the devil?! "Blazing spirit of the mines"? It's the devil! You took the dead to the village? Yes, we've just taken them home. You mean since midnight you stopped working? So why do I pay you? Why do I pay you? Get the hell in the mine! Grind the blown rock! Sieve it, throw it out. Now I want to hear the blasts in the new gallery! Bring other clothes! Damn these roads! Iosif, Iosif.. I must get money somehow, I must strike gold. Until people realize the old shaft is deserted. In a couple of days I must find gold! I must find gold! I still don't get it how he got away from you! Devil of a man, not my fault! Set his eyes on me exactly when I wanted to hit him. He was lucky. Devil's man! And? He slid down the rope at once. By the moment I cut the rope he already was close to the bottom, so he didn't fall so bad. I threw boulders on top of him, but nothing, he had hide himself in a nook After four hours I saw him on the flowery bank. He knew the way What will you do if he comes back? He won't. Why? He had so much gold... to last two lives! And what lives! Get out! Why? - Untranslated subtitle - Do what I tell you! Take this shovel and dig under the barrel. Why? You'll see!Dig! Where the hell it its?You found it? Deeper!Dig up! Nothing! Then stop digging and come in. You say he ran away? If you digged I could have forgiven you, but stoling from me!...this can't be forgiven! You'll be sorry for the rest of your life! You bandit!Stupid thief! Don't you think that people saw us this morning. But you loved Marza, isn't it?And you forgave him! I loved him because he was worth it! Put this in your head! From now on you're my slave , you're my dog. otherwise I tell the gendarmes all about you. Where is the new one? Waiting down the lane. And how is he? Fine, I know him well. Forget that.He is a good miner? The best. Go bring him. Come, man! She is waiting for you. Good day! You're a miner?Yes. Tell you the truth, you don't look like one and I haven't see you at the pub. I don't drink. So, there is no more gold? No.Finish both the gold and Rodean I for one have something that I want to sell! You want to give it to me, now in broad daylight? What's your name? Florea is my name. Florea, there is gold but it's hidden deep down because there is nobody to get it out. Come some evening and we'll talk more. Come through the old gate, on back. Thank you for coming. I thank you, director for calling me. I didn't think you'd remember me. You're still beautiful. Don't tell me you called me for this? No. But between you and me, only you stayed young. I've grown old and indebted I need 20.000 zlots in loan for a week How do you imagine I have such a fortune, director? When you left me, some 16 or 18 years ago I vas penniless. Things have changed meanwhile. I helped you open the pub. People drink because they are brainless, whereas you put by because you're thrifty 20.000 zlots untile I strike gold. Sorry, director You forget I helped you raise your daughter, I never scraped then. It's also your daughter, director! Even if you never wanted to see her. My daughter!Maria! What good so much wealth, if nobody in this house ever has a moment's peace. I've had it whining women. A good thing lawyer marcu didn't come , too. Marcu left Maria when his house downtown was confiscated. God!My girls! When you'll stop the talking and the crying we'll talk. For now let's see how ends this stupid thing. I'll go to work.
