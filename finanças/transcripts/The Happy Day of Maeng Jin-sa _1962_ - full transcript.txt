Mt. Geumgang in Gangwon, Mt. Gyeryong in Chungcheong, Mt. Jiri in Jeolla, Mt. Taebaek in Gyeongsang, Mt. Baekdu in Hamgyeong, Mt. Guwol in Hwanghae, and Pavillion Yeonggwang in Pyeongyang. I can't go everywhere. Right. Good. Yippee! Hurray and hurrah! Where did she go? Where is my lady? Liu Bei had to pay three visits to see Zhuge Liang. - Hello. - What's the matter? Have you seen Lady Gap-bun? She seems to be excited. She went up the mountain again with Ip-bun. You should be careful, Sam-dol. Ip-bun seems to be grown into a woman this year. Have you seen her curvy butt? Hey, don't tease. You have a slim chance to win her anyway. Stop teasing. I'm busy. Damn! Screw you! Wow! There are some bellflowers here, too. My lady, come quickly. Leave them. I want to pick them myself. Sure. Here you go. But my lady, this is a baby bellflower. Throw it away then. It's too small to eat anyway. Poor bellflower, you could've grown and bloomed like the others. You are harsh, my lady. - No, I'm not. - My lady! Lady Gap-bun! Where are you, Ip-bun? - What a stupid fool. - Ip-bun, my love! Let's hide somewhere. Right. I've searched every corner of the land, but I can't find my lady. Once I see my lady, I will hold her ears in my hands, touch my nose on hers, and kiss her lips. Hey, Ip-bun! Ip-bun, Ip-bun. My dear, Ip-bun. I will hug her and she will hug me like the best of lovers. We will have fun and live happily ever after. Where did my lady go? She probably doesn't know I'm looking for. You fool. What did you say? Sing the song again. - Come on, how dare you! - It's just a song I picked up. My lady, you should come home quickly. Master has come back! Gosh, he has come back in no time at all. I wonder how wonderful man he brought as your future husband. Don't follow me. You go pick more herbs. I will pick plenty of bellflowers for your wedding feast. Is she that excited to get married? She has become a completely different person. Did you get his consent? Sure. We just need to choose an auspicious day for the wedding. Once arranged, this marriage will be your first ever accomplishment. We should put up a stone to commemorate your effort. I've been sure of success since I hired people to spread good stories about Gap-bun in Bellflower Village. Please let me escort Gap-bun when she gets married. Please, master. Of course, don't worry. Talking about escorts already... Let's not get our hopes up. Have a little faith. Can you blame her? It's like the first time you did a good job. How dare you look down on me! I'm sorry. I should shut my mouth. This punch tastes odd. It was made just as you like it. We will soon be in-laws of Minister Kim's family. This food has to taste better if we are to save face as Minister Kim's in-laws. I thought you went to meet the groom, not to compare their our food with ours. You know nothing. Don't be too surprised. Come on, sit down. About the size of the Minister's house, I've never been to the palace, but... Sir, my legs are trembling. It proves you are a petty man. Yes, I am. Oh no, my stomach... My stomach aches. Sir. My stomach hurts having walked so far. The heat must have got to me. Oh no, I can't make a mistake in front of the Minister. Ouch, my stomach... - God, it aches. - Shall we come back next time? Oh my stomach... You go instead. I'll be waiting under a tree in front of the village. Me? Just swing by and cover for me. Sir, how could I? Hey! What is it that you're supposed to do for us? Well... Just do as I say, okay? - Yes, sir. - Just do it. God, my stomach aches. I was wrong to have tagged along. All I wanted was some good wine. - Hey, you! - Good God! Who are you? Good morning. I am just a passerby. What are you doing here? The weather's just glorious today. What? So what? It's this old man's lifelong dream to look around the Minister's house. Why don't I buy you a drink in return? I don't drink. What about some nice watermelon or oriental melon? We grow plenty of them in our fields. What about money, then? What? This is not a show house. Leave now. Get out! I said get out. Stop talking and leave. Wait, let me ask you one last thing. What is it? I heard your young master is good-looking. Needless to say, of course. Thank you. For what? I'm relieved. Good bye! What a crazy old man. There were more than 12 houses. There certainly were. - Just the same as I heard. - Yes, indeed. What else did you see? I saw... I spotted... What, you only saw servant's rooms and sheds? Father, your pipe has gone out. Rumor has it that the groom, Mi-eon, has an ill temper. Did you see him? Oh, please. Come on, uncle. Why are you worried? He's the son of the Minister. What is there to meet? What do you mean? Don't judge a book by its cover. Actually, I never intended to meet him. Because... What? Why not? Because I am but a "Jinsa." Don't be too naive. We are talking about the Minister's only son here. If I insist on meeting him, I may break the rules of etiquette of a powerful noble family. I've never heard the like in all my 60 years. What else? Also, so what if the groom is ill-tempered? It's not easy to be in-laws to a family of such powerful standing. In the future, we can only benefit from them. - What? Benefit? - Certainly. If your goal is to join the families, not just getting your daughter married, then I have nothing further to say. Uncle... Let me pay my respects to future Lady Jeonggyeong. Stop it, Chambong. Dear, you have to behave now on. Stop hanging around with Ip-bun and the other girls in the village. That's right. By the way, what does uncle say? He is dying of jealousy. No wonder. What about my father-in-law? There's no doubt. I'm talking about Gap-bun's marriage. Father. - Gap-bun? - Yes. She's old enough to get married. - Married? - Yes, she's 19 already. 19? Who is 19? Your granddaughter is 19. I mean your son's only daughter. What do you think? With the son of Minister Kim. With whom? With Mi-eon, the son of Minister Kim living in Bellflower Village. - Minister Kim from Bellflower Village? - Yes. Good. That's great! Son. The father of Minister Kim is Kim Seung-ji, right? Yes. You know Kim Seung-ji was a great man. He was the Governor of Pyeongan. That's why this marriage is satisfactory. - Marriage? - Yes. What marriage? Who's getting married? Gap-bun is getting married. We have to marry her off to someone, right? - You are talking about Gap-bun! - Yes, father. Who is Gap-bun? She's my daughter. Your granddaughter. Okay. What do you think about her with Minister Kim's son? That's very nice. But what about the age gap? - With Minister Kim? - Oh my. She may get hurt. I'm talking about Minister Kim's son. You are speaking too loud. Does the Minister have a grown-up son? Ip-bun! Dear Ip-bun, don't be heartbroken. Who are you? Me? People call me the Bellflower Man. The Bellflower Man? How strange. What kind of a name is that? I live in a village across the mountain. You should come visit sometime. The bellflowers are in full bloom all year round there. From the leaves bloom flowers. From the flowers bloom heavenly fairies. It's a utopia where only pretty and good girls such as yourself live. Hey, Ip-bun. You scared me. You won't need to pick herbs anymore when our lady gets married soon. What? Is it already decided? Why are you so excited? It's not like you're getting married. I'm following my lady. We already made a promise. I don't think our madam will allow you to leave. She has another idea in mind. What idea? You'll see. She is considering... Don't laugh like that. I'm not lying. Haven't you heard? You and I are... I don't want to listen. Hey, Ip-bun! Leave me alone, you moron. Oh, it's cold! Ouch, dear me. Look at that. What are you laughing at? Young man, look. I missed it. It's gone. Are you fishing with a straight hook? Indeed, I am. You must have lost your mind. You'll catch nothing with that hook. Watch it! I'm not the only one who failed to hook something. Your frustration must be killing you! What an old fogey. In this coming mid-autumn festival, this Jinsa Tae-ryang hereby declares in front of his great-great-grandfather that Tae-ryang's only daughter, Gap-bun is in the prime of life and asks for your consent to her marriage with Minister Kim's first son, Mi-eon, from Bellflower Village. To do so, Jinsa Tae-ryang performs this rite sincerely, offers fruits and alcohols in front of you, and speaks devoutly. A young lady is getting married, but a young man is going to hang himself Don't say such awful things. Then stop touching it or buy it. What do you think of this? Ip-bun has always wanted it. What is that? She has a good taste. This so-called "powder" is used by noble ladies in Seoul. Is it expensive? It's 20, but I'll take half that price in celebration of the marriage. I will give you 5. A quarter of the original price? Not a chance. So this is... Well then... They are coming! Hey, come on. You have to pay for it. Then I'll buy it next time. Wait a minute. Don't you want to see Ip-bun delighted? I surely do. - Give me the money. - Follow me. Hey, man. - One, two! - Good. - Three, four! - Great. And five! What a jerk. They are here! They are coming! - They are here! - Are they? A huge group is on the way. Come on, hurry! Let's go. Master, they are coming. - They just... - Are they? They just passed below Nose Rock. Okay. Oh, my legs are cramping! - Good God. - Master. Rub your spit on your nose. Hey, Chambong Park. - Yes, sir. - Don't just stand there. Can I count on you having prepared everything properly? Of course. Good. Well done. Wait a second. - What am I thinking? - What's wrong? I almost forgot. Dear grandfather, great grandfather, great-great-grandfather, and ancestors. I am now officially an in-law to Minister Kim. An in-law to Minister Kim... Everything looks so fancy coming from the Minister's house. You live and learn. But how indecent that gifts are sent for the marriage. Wow, look at those presents. - There are so many. - Tell me about it. One, two, three. Four, five, six, seven! Hey, are they wedding gifts for us? All of them? Yes, they are. Sam-dol, go get a bowl of cold water. Yes! Eight, nine... Master, they've arrived! Hurray and hurrah! What a great day! Hurray and hurrah! Water, water! What is he doing? Leave him alone. Thinking of marrying Ip-bun, he is excited more than you, my lady. Stop it, nanny. Here is the water. Yes, the water! Please come in. I brought water. Who is this moron? Kick him out, Chambong. - Yes. - This way, please. What were you thinking, bringing water in a bowl? What? You totally messed up. No more marriage with Ip-bun. - Oh my God. - My goodness! - Who did this? - Are you okay, madam? What should we do? Someone must have thrown water. Shoot. What an imbecile. Hush, madam. Let's wipe it up. Things are getting worse. What a fate! I took the liberty of bringing some gifts the Minister wanted to give you. You shouldn't have. There's no need to bring so many. - This is the list. - Thank you. - Chambong. - Yes, sir. Chambong. This has never happened before in my family, but how can I say no to the Minister's kind consideration? I am glad to have come here as a messenger. You must be worn out having come all the way in this heat. Chambong, have food and drinks brought to us. Wait, this is the list of gifts. 5 rolls of songgeumdaedan silk, 3 rolls of uncut silk, 6 rolls of orongchobaegi silk, 2 rolls of chokdaedan silk, 4 rolls of navy-colored silk, 3 rolls of manhwadan silk, 5 rolls of sunset silk, 1 roll of mochodan silk, 2 rolls of 5-colored silk. 3 rolls of johwangna silk, 2 rolls of oehwangna silk, 3 rolls of ramie-hwangna silk, 6 rolls of myeongju-hwangna silk, 3 rolls of dam-hwangna silk. 5 rolls of artificial hwangna silk, 6 rolls of 3-thread silk, 2 rolls of 5-thread silk, 3 rolls of jwa and 2 of wu silk, 1 roll of uncut myeongju silk, 4 rolls of genuine myeongju silk, 5 rolls of kudzu silk, 2 rolls of fine myeongju silk, 3 rolls of naejupoju silk, 4 rolls of 2-folded silk. These are amazing. Wow, they are dazzling and radiant. They are too beautiful to touch, madam. They were sent from the Minister's house. They can't be the same. Hey, leave the room. Don't touch anything. Dear future Lady Jeonggyeong, why don't you receive my bow? Stop it, nanny. Out of the way! Ouch! Madam, please forgive my behavior a moment ago. Look at him. - You fool. - Be more careful next time. I also want to make a deep bow to the future Lady Jeonggyeong. - Goodness. - He's a funny guy. Stop it, you guys. - Ip-bun. - Yes? Where are you going? Yes, madam. I am going with my lady. You also need start behaving if you want to marry Sam-dol. Definitely. I don't want to. I want to go with my lady. Stop the nonsense. You will be in trouble when my husband hears it. Madam, but I can't live without my lady. No. You have to stop spending time with your lady, and watch your language. You are a maid, and she is your master. Yes, madam. Go wash wooden patterns for rice cake. Yes, madam. Yes, we are commoners. We are servants. So what? You noble people are not so different from us commoners. It's not like you eat 3 bowls of rice in one sitting. We are all human beings. Hey, Sam-dol. Don't feel bad, Ip-bun. Here. I bought this for you. Look at it. Isn't this the same powder my lady uses? Yes. When she leaves, you can put this on and you and I should... Stop it, you moron. Ouch. No way! It's all ruined. Send them back immediately. We the Maeng family, aren't going downhill. Not so much as to accept riches to marry off our daughter. I don't think they are inappropriate. What did you say? Are you saying this how much one must pay to buy your daughter? Sir. It's not your place to intervene. Yes, sir. This marriage is a bought-out. Sima Guang said that involving riches in marriage is barbaric. You are so right. Uncle, but that's... If we send them back at this point, wouldn't it offend the common decency? - That's right. - Of course. You keep talking about etiquette and decency. But how come can you forget our family's rules of etiquette? It was not easy to arrange this marriage. Do you think you will be given a good position overnight once your daughter marries the Minister's son? Suit yourself. Sir. One rotten apple spoils the barrel. If you do something disgraceful, I will not forgive you. Hyo-won, where are you going? Hyo-won. Hyo-won. When did you get marry? Were you 13? Son, my son. Hyo-won! He went to buy the ap... apple. Apple? It's my daughter's marriage. Why does he want to have a say? - Ip-bun! - Yes, master? God, he's harassing me for no reason. Tell my daughter to come out. Yes. She just went out. How convenient to be roaming around when her father's growing anxious. Go get her, quickly. Yes, master. By the way, my daughter must not hang out with commoners. I understand. What, so am I the rotten apple? I am an in-law to a Minister now. Being an uncle does not give a man a free pass to say whatever he wants. How dare he say good comes with the bad! Eat. Here you go. You already look like a bride. You look radiant. You should treat us to something big. What treat? You will find someone you love and get marry, too. We are not as lucky as you. I heard your husband-to-be is pretty amazing. His appearance is as good as Du Mu's. His writings are as good as Su Shi's. Is his calligraphy as good as Wang Xizhi's? You should definitely treat us something. Buy us something good. All right. Let's arrange something soon. Where are you going? Gap-bun is a lucky woman She became Lady Jeonggyeong In the village across the lake, she became the wife of Minister Kim's first son, becoming a woman of high social standing Gap-bun is a lucky woman She became Lady Jeonggyeong To see her newlywed groom, she wears a silk dress As the mandarin duck flies, she became a woman of high social standing Gap-bun is a lucky woman She became Lady Jeonggyeong She dresses herself like a lady of refined manners Two mandarin ducks are next to each other She became a woman of high social standing Gap-bun is a lucky woman She became Lady Jeonggyeong In the village across the lake... - My lady! - Why are you here? Master is asking for you. Girls, let's go. You, get the bowls and come later. Yes, my lady. I'll be quick. Wait for me, please. Many pretty young ladies live in this village. Once a flower blooms, people notice it, whether small or big. Now that the young ladies are in bloom, they stand out. The young lady at the front is the only daughter of Jinsa Maeng. Minister Kim from Bellflower Village has picked the wrong daughter-in-law. Excuse me? What do you mean? You'll see when you visit. Wait a minute. Dear Maitreya. I am a lonely girl with no family or relatives. I practically grew up together with Lady Gap-bun. I've depended on her as if she were my sister. Please let me follow my lady when she goes her new home. I'll do whatever you tell me to do. Dear Maitreya, please hear my prayer. Excuse me. Do you live in this village? Yes. I am looking for the house of Jinsa Maeng. Can you tell me where it is? Over the hill, you will see big tile-roofed houses on the right. All right, I came to the right place. Thank you. My family tree is so wanting. Nobody has even passed the regional exam. Some passed the state exam, but only in my generation. I did a good job of buying a government post, didn't I? Please, father. The 6th ancestor ran a linen shop. The 7th ancestor ran a liquor bowl shop. What is a liquor bowl shop? The 8th ancestor sold random things. Out of all jobs, your ancestors were working in the lowest class. Darn you! Walls have ears, too. - Chambong. - Yes, sir. Rewrite it. Leave no trace. Are you asking me to rewrite your genealogy? Yes, is there a problem? We barely keep track of those alive, let alone a family tree. All family trees are like that. Sure. Let me see... What is the highest position? - It's the Prime Minister. - Father, let me handle this. Let's make the 6th ancestor the Prime Minister. Excuse me? That'll be too drastic of a jump. Is that so? Ancestors must gain higher positions gradually in the course of time. You're right. In that case, let's start from a ferocious police chief. That's a good idea. And next... Let's make the 7th ancestor Chief Scholar of Sungkyunkwan! This way, your family excels in both literary and martial arts. Now that I can choose, I want the better ones. As for the 8th ancestor... Governor of Pyeongan is a pretty good position. - Yes. - Governor of Pyeongan. It's done. Master. - Now what? - For God's sake. What do you want? A scholar was passing by and asked if he could stay a night. Stay a night here? My house isn't an inn or a nest. Send him away. No, it's not that. Tell him he can't. No, please hear me out. Who calls himself a scholar nowadays? Exactly. That guy is talking nonsense. Kick him out! Things are different. I made up my mind. Come on, throw him out. It's not that... It looks good. It's like adding wings to a tiger. Hey, look. As the son-in-law of Tae-ryang, write Mi-eon, the son of Minister Kim. Beautiful hills in spring and fall are the pride of a temple, and chestnuts in autumn are abundant around it. Write Mi-eon's name under my own. Excuse me? That will make Mi-eon a member of your family, not Kim's. I said all family trees are written as people wish. Yes, I'll rewrite it as you wish. I sent him away. Well done. He said it'd be hard to get to Bellflower Village before sunset, and asked desperately if he could stay overnight. Now the genealogy looks perfect. By the way, you are a good calligrapher. Your parents must have been strict. What did you say? Bellflower Village? He will have to sweat buckets if he wants to make it. Bellflower Village is where the Minister lives. Shoot. I know. That's what I meant to tell you... You fool! Chambong, hurry. Run after him and bring him here. - This is terrible. - Get your act together. What if he really came from Bellflower Village? You stupid birdbrain! Well, your brain is not any bigger. - Honey. Honey. - Yes? Go get me a robe. What's going on? He's here. Go get me a robe, now! Wait, take this family tree! Bring my hat, too. Excuse me! Wait a minute! Oh my, Mr. Chambong! Are you okay? Good God. Let me help you up. Ip-bun, stop the man over there and escort him here. Jinsa Maeng... Hurry up and bring him. Excuse me. Sir! Please stop. Excuse me. My master, Jinsa Maeng, asked me to escort you to the house. You were from his house. Yes. You little prick! Let me apologize for my servants' rudeness. May I ask you who you are? I am Kim Myeong-jeong, a scholar from Bellflower Village. All right. I heard your house has a neat guesthouse, so I wanted to study here for a few days. If you are from Bellflower Village, do you know Minister Kim? Of course, I do. The family is so powerful that it can make a bird fall. They are my in-laws. Is that so? The guesthouse is not that nice, but you're welcome to stay. Sam-dol, bring us some food and drinks. Ip-bun is a maid, but she's kind, pretty, and gentle. She's better than... Do you know the young master of Bellflower Village? Of course I do. I taught him the basic thousand characters. The master almost made a mistake in front of this important person. But why on earth does he marry his daughter with the first son? What do you mean? His writings are as good as... Yes! Su Shi's. His calligraphy is as good... as Wang Xizhi's. It has the style of Wang Xizhi. My point exactly. His appearance... People say that he looks... Out of shape. He doesn't look good. Really? Out of shape? I thought he would fail to find joy in life and die alone. Who would've thought a dead tree could blossom so? Flowers on a dead tree? No wonder the Minister's son hasn't found a spouse for 20 years. Is there a reason? You really don't know? What? What a cool breeze. No way. It can't be true. Shh. Please keep it quiet. Oh my god, this affects many people. Master. I can't do it. No, Your Excellency. Master. Your Excellency. I can't. Master! There is a problem. What? Why? Did he come? Where's my hat? No, master. You must hear it. Sam-dol! Never breathe a word of this. My lips are sealed. Master. Madam asks you to come in for a minute. Dear, your father's here. Come on out. Don't be shy, my lady. - Come here. - Let's show him, my lady. Come on up here. Stop it, nanny. Look at her in her wedding dress. She looks so stunning that the moon is jealous. Honey, say something. It's good. You look beautiful. Madam. A lowly person like myself is full of mixed feelings. He must be sorry he has to part with his only daughter whom he raised with love for 20 years. Father. Father. About Gap-bun's husband... You are speaking too loud again. Father! Gap-bun's husband is like this. Like this. Just like this. Come on, father. Stop it, son. I get it now. A long time ago, an 80-year-old son who sings well wore a colorful dress for children and nagged his father to catch him a sparrow. And then... His 100-year-old father was very happy to see his son acting cute. Now you are trying to make me laugh. That's my boy. You are a good son. Father. I'm not singing. What? Like this. I prefer a hunchback's dance to a cripple's walk. Dear, why don't you... - Son. - It's terrible. - What? - I'm in big trouble. Don't cry. I'm not a good dancer, but let me try. Wait a minute. Hurray and hurrah! Hooray! Father, please stop. You'll get hurt. Father, you can get hurt. I'll do the dance, instead. - Look at me. - It's so fun. Hurray and hurrah! What a nice day. - Hooray! - You're doing great. Hurray and hurrah. We don't have time for this. It turns out Mi-eon is a cripple. Where are you going? Ouch, my back. - My leg! - Chambong. - Yes. - How dare you! You are making fun of him right before me? What? Will you keep walking like a cripple? Why are you so upset? When will you stop limping in front of me? The children were doing it, so... What? The rumor's already spread across the village? After a bad dream last night, you became a laughing stock. How dare you laugh! I'm going to kick them out! Sir! Wait for me! My Goodness. Hello. Well, is the rumor true? - Excuse me? - Well, Minister Kim... The rumor says the son of the Minister is... Where there's smoke, there's fire. How did he become a cripple? I heard he was born a cripple. He was born a cripple? I guess I said too much. No, you didn't. What should I do? Is it the right leg? Or the left? I guess it doesn't matter. Does he limp a lot? Yes, quite a lot. I don't want to hear it. You wanted to tell me that snake story again, right? How a woman of virtue married the snake and became Lady Jeonggyeong. It's disgusting. I'm not someone to make fun of. Sweetie, you have to think of your father and our family. Our two families made a promise. If you are to push, I'm going to kill myself. Sweetie. Dearie. I'm doomed. I hate you, father! - Sweetie. - Look. Look what you've done to your family. How can you be so incompetent that you send your only daughter to a stupid cripple? I guess my marriage is off the table. But why was a cripple chosen when there're so many healthy young men? You! You fool! I feel so bad that you are all upset. I wish I were dead. I guess you are the only one who understands me. How nice of you. If it were possible, I would give my legs to the groom. Thank you for saying that. I will never forget how considerate you are. I hate you, man! What an idiot! Greedy! A fool, stupid, fatso, ugly toad! My lady, wait a minute. My lady! To call off the wedding, it's the Minister on the other side. To proceed the wedding, she's the only daughter. That's right. We reached a dead end. We are completely cornered. You're saying that it's helpless? It all began because he didn't meet the son. He didn't want to break etiquette, so he only saw the servant's rooms and sheds. Don't be too hard on Tae-ryang. Even Xiang Yu lost his castle. Xiang Yu? Make no good on his name. Anyways, one is shorter than the other, right? I won't be able to stand the sight of him. He'll be a sorry sight. Don't laugh. This is an important matter of life and of our family. If he had injured his leg on the battlefield, it would have been an honorable injury. Unfortunately, it's not. Chambong, what does the bride think? You don't want to know. Lady said, "A cripple? I will never marry a cripple!" - She has a point. - She is right. But the problem is beyond her. It all comes down to the rise and fall of the Maeng family. That's right. Let's make up our mind. The wedding is on. We have no way to call it off. But are we ready to accept a cripple in our family? I'm not so sure. No, we are not ready. We have reached a dead end. We are cornered. This is worrisome. It's a big problem. There they are Here they go A beggar from last year came back again He meant to come last month but couldn't because of rain When the newlywed groom walks, he limps. He limps on his way home. He limps, stumbles. He's a limping man so he's like a male Chun-hyang. That's right. Well. Don't get me confused with Jinsa Maeng's son-in-law. Ladies, why don't I teach you a song? Gap-bun is Lady Jeonggyeong She is newly wedded Sky cheon, earth ji, star jin and then limp Limp and stumble, limp and stumble Your mother is worried about you. You have to be strong at a time like this. I didn't say anything. You don't need to. I know everything. If you love him, he will also love you. Love? What do you know about love? Stop talking crazy and leave me alone. Who cares if he was a harelip or a cripple? All you need is a sincere heart. You can overcome everything. I'm sure your husband has a sincere heart. How can you be so sure? Have you lived with that cripple? My goodness. That's a bit much. What then? What are you trying to pull? I'm an ignorant, lowly person. But I can die for a sincere heart. You should go and live with him, then. Go ahead. I won't stop you. Why do you pretend to be a cripple? - Come here! - Calm down, sir. It's easier to get money or food like this. How dare you make fun of a nobleman! Sam-dol, break his leg. Wait a minute, sir. I have a great idea. What great idea? - Oops, master. - Ouch, my legs! This stick is curved so I missed my target. I'll get some ointment. I feel like my leg is broken. It serves you right. How dare you! Sir, wait a minute. I have a great idea. With Gap-bun? Brothers! There is, there is! - There's what? - What is there? Come closer. - A scheme. - A scheme? I have a clever scheme. What kind of scheme is it? We will switch Gap-bun with Ip-bun. What a good idea! We will switch Gap-bun with Ip-bun. - What? - Really? If you can't get a horse, ride a cow. Gap-bun will be replaced by Ip-bun. I have already talked to your uncle in Unsan Village, so stay there until we go get you, okay? Take good care of her, nanny. Don't worry. I never expected this kind of escort, though. - How does it look? - Let's hurry. I see no one. - Nanny! - Yes, master. Come on, hurry! - My lady, where are you going? - Be quiet. Take me with you, please. Let me go! My lady! Be quiet! So who's getting married? Please explain in detail. You fools. Let me get straight to the point. For some reason I don't know. Ip-bun has become Lady Gap-bun. Do you follow? No. What a birdbrain. How can you be so stupid? Let me give you an example. Let's say Ip-bun has become the lady of this house and will go to Bellflower Village to get married. But keep in mind that all this is secret. You cannot tell anyone in Bellflower Village or the other villages. We mustn't speak about it out loud at all. Any questions? Now I've seen it all. I don't know what is going on. You fools. Go talk to your neighbors. Make sure the secret is well-kept. God, I'm tired. Chambong. I don't understand the first part. What, the first part? The question is whose groom and whose son-in-law is that young man? He is the son-in-law of master Maeng, who is the father of Lady Gap-bun. You got it now? So in the end, it's Gap-bun who gets married, right? Well... No. Which Gap-bun were you talking about? Good God. You are the idiot, Chambong. Let me explain. What's wrong with me? I will make it easy for you to understand. Ip-bun equals Lady Gap-bun, and Lady Gap-bun equals Lady Gap-bun. So, the Lady Gap-bun who gets married is Ip-bun who is not Ip-bun. The Lady Gap-bun who doesn't get married is Lady Gap-bun who is not Lady Gap-bun. It's pretty simple. Please explain it slowly. God, you are stupid. Ip-bun is Ip-bun. Lady Gap-bun is Lady Gap-bun. How come you don't get it? Are you a fox disguised as a human? My goodness. You got it, right? Hey. Hey, Ip-bun. You must never tell anyone about it. No, master. That will upset Heaven. But think about it. It's all for Gap-bun. No, madam. I would be cut into pieces and die if it were for her, but I can't do this. Just pretend you don't know anything, and get married. That's all. God, you know it's a terrible thing to do. I pity the young master. He doesn't know any of this. He will have to marry a lowly woman like me. You pity him? Did you think I'd marry my daughter to a cripple? Master, don't make me do this, please. I would do anything else. I would die, but... You little fox. You're lying. You don't care about Gap-bun. You treacherous thing! - Calm down. - Rather kill me rather, master. You don't want to repay the love and sacrifice we spent raising you. Whatever you say, as of today, you are Gap-bun. You know what? Ip-bun is getting married. Her groom used to be Lady Gap-bun's groom. It doesn't add up. What masters do never add up. - You're right. - Oh my. Ip-bun is a tenant farmer. A tenant farmer? Her groom is rice. A person cannot be rice. A person eats rice. We grow rice, but rice is for noblemen. Ultimately, all the crops that Ip-bun grows will be taken by Jinsa Maeng. Isn't that right? - It's Ip-bun. - No, it's Gap-bun. No, it's Ip-bun who gets married. - It's Ip-bun. - It's Gap-bun. No, it's Ip-bun. No, Ip-bun is marrying the cripple instead of Gap-bun. Poor Ip-bun. Poor her. Let me use math to explain. This is Ip-bun and this is Gap-bun. This is the young master. This Ip-bun has become Lady Gap-bun. Let's say the two are multiplied. Now, one of them has to marry the young master. Sure. Off she goes. This is the Minister's daughter-in-law. Who is this then? - This? - Is it Ip-bun or Gap-bun? I'm lost. Darn it! Did you deliver the message to everyone clearly that they'll lose their farmland if they let the secret out? Of course I did. Don't worry. They don't pay much attention to what you do, anyways. I guess you're right. A good strategy always solves a problem. Hey, Sam-dol. Bring us more drinks. This is not a party. Don't bother, Sam-dol. Okay, then Sam-dol, go around and see who is talking about what, and report to me in detail. People cannot know you are spying on them. - I don't need to spy on them. - Why not? Everyone is saying bad things about you just outside door. - What did you say? - Look what you've done. There is a gentleman from Bellflower Village at the door. What's up? Is he leaving? God, at last. What's with that face? Tell him I'll be there soon. Darling, get me a robe, quickly. And my hat, too. Please hurry. It seems something is going on in the village. Is there a problem? No, everything's fine. I was talking about threshing with tenant farmers. I'm leaving for Bellflower Village now. Is there any message you want me to deliver? Well... I'm sorry you're leaving so soon. Time seems to be running slow. We look forward to the wedding day. - Good bye. - Good bye. - Thank you for everything. - My pleasure. - Master. - You surprised me. - What now? - It's not what you promised. Come on, there are other girls apart from Ip-bun. Choose whomever you want. Geum-rye, Gop-dan, or Tan-sil. That's not what I want. Excuse me, sir. - You are from the... - Yes. I'm Lady Gap-bun's maid. Do you have anything to say to me? I hope you can tell the Minister to reconsider this marriage. Why is that? What are the reasons? Please don't ask me why. I told you this at the risk of my life. Please don't forget. All right. I'll deliver the message as soon as I arrive. Have a safe trip. Ip-bun, you mindless girl. What are you doing in the lady's seat? Whatever happens happens. Deal with it. Let me pour you some more. If you are a noble, can you break a promise you made to a servant? That's how the world is. My Ip-bun, you can't get married. Wait and see. Hey, I'll pay for the drinks. The money was not for the drinks. Die! - Stupid! - Damn you! What a cunning fox! I left more than enough to cover the bowls. - Hey, Sam-dol. - Let me go. Someone is going to get hurt. Ip-bun is getting married but the young man is going to hang himself Yay! It's good It's so good What does he find so good? Goodbye, Ip-bun. Goodbye, world. It looks deep. One. Two. This poor young man is about to die and no one is here to push me in the back. Help! I'm dying! Help! What a moron. What? Old man, I'm going to die. Young man, you scared away the fish. Why do you care more about fish when a person is dying? Shut up, you fool! You can die all you want. Aren't you supposed to stop me? Help! I'm really dying. Let's get it done quickly. Hurry, everyone! Move, move! It's not your wedding day, Chambong. Why make a fuss? I don't have eyes in the back of my head. Let's go, everyone! Come on, hurry up! You little wench. I can understand that you don't want to get married. But how dare you send a secret message to the Minister? Darn you. You sly fox! I never thought you'd do such thing. Just kill me, master. I don't care about my body, but I couldn't go along with that awful plan of yours. - Look at you, talking back. - An awful plan, you say? Ruining my entire family isn't awful to you? That's not it, master. It will be known to the world sooner or later. I thought the best way would be to stop it from happening. Please forgive me. Dear gods of the sky and ground, please hear my prayer. Please pity this old bachelor Sam-dol and help me marry Ip-bun. I beg of you, dear gods. Please hear my desperate prayer. My god, it's barely morning and that cripple is coming already. Sir. Sir, come on out. They are coming. Where is he? Are they really coming? Yes, sir. You can relax now. Thanks. No way. I don't believe this. Where are you going? Madam, let me go. I can never do it. You little wretch! No, wait. Dear, be a good girl. - Good. - Don't say a word. Let's get her ready. Helper lady! I mean, nanny! Let me go, please. Please madam. I can't. Please forgive me. Dear, we'll take care of what happens after. It can't be helped now. Let it go now and do what we asked you. Please, dear. Your first day won't come again. You surely don't want bad luck. Let's get ready now. Why was I ever born? - I blame the world. - Hush, good girl. Ip-bun. I mean, Gap-bun. Ip-bun. Gap-bun. Come sit here. Sit. When you arrive, you must take care of your in-laws. You must follow the rules of etiquette at all times, okay? Why aren't you answering me? Dear, don't be like that. All right. - Ip-bun, dear. - Wrong, again. God. Dear Gap-bun. Don't forget you are my daughter, not even in your dreams. Try calling me father. Do what he says. Come on. Try it. Father. Which leg do you think is crippled? From here, he looks fine. He is good-looking. It's a shame. Shall I find someone for you? Impossible. Ok-nam is not Gap-bun. Star jin and then limp. You are... - How have you been? - Good. You must have been concerned about this wedding. Wait a minute. Why don't we let him ride the horse into the garden? That won't be necessary. Sure. Please lean on me. Hold me. What on earth? My Goodness. It's as shocking as the sky and the ground turning upside down. - Sir! Master! - Why? - Did they arrive? - Come here. Why are you so agitated? You can't just stand here calmly. Why not? Well, his legs are not crippled. We have no time for jokes. It's no joke. Wait a minute. Sir, your shoes! You forgot your shoes, sir. Chambong, am I still dreaming? This way, come on. This way, and that way. Walk this way, and this way. Step forward. You are... I mean... Walk this way. With your left foot. Right foot. And left foot. This seems wrong. Let's try walking with two feet. Two feet together. Turn around. Turn to the back. Stop. Walk again. Forward. Step forward. Stop. It's weird. I may be breaking etiquette but you are mistaken in being here. Excuse me? You can't be Minister Kim's son Mi-eon. Are you suggesting that this is not Jinsa Maeng's house? No, I am Jinsa Maeng. But surely you're not my son-in-law. He certainly is... Certainly what? - A cripple! - In-law. Oh, it was you. You were the one who said that my son-in-law is a cripple. Well, about that... About that? What about that? In fact, with my brother Minister Kim... Minister Kim is your brother? Yes, I discussed this matter with my brother in advance. I will soon tell you the reasons but I am sorry to make you worry. In-law, this is Mi-eon. - In-law? - He's Mi-eon? Oh geez! Why on earth did you want my family to... The Maeng family is ruined. We are doomed. What should I do? Will a marriage with our family ruin your house? What? No. Excuse me. I talk nonsense sometimes. Wait, I shouldn't be just standing here. Wait a minute. Hey, Sam-dol. Go and bring Gap-bun here as quickly as possible. Do you enjoy playing with me? Isn't Lady Gap-bun just over there? Hey, you can't get married. No, silly. I'm talking about real Gap-bun. Alright. If you are a noble, can you break a promise you made to a servant? Ip-bun is mine. You said so yourself. I'm talking about the real Gap-bun. I know. You set me up like that. Wait and see. Stop talking. No matter how noble you are, you shouldn't mess with your servants. Yes, you're right. Sam-dol, pull yourself together. I'm talking about Gap-bun, not Ip-bun. - What? - Run to Unsan Village like an arrow. Then you can have Ip-bun right away. - Are you sure? - Yes, I am. I knew it! Master, drink up. Okay. Be quick. Hurry. You promised! Father. Father! What? I have something to tell you. He's not like this. My son-in-law is not a cripple. What did you say? Tae-ryang, are you saying that my son-in-law is a cripple? You idiot! No, father. He's not. This marriage is off. How can you give my precious granddaughter to a cripple? No way. - Father, please. - Let me go. Hear me out, father. Father, please. He's not a cripple. He's not! - Calm down. - Stay out of my way. Even if he were the son of the Prime Minister, a cripple is not acceptable. Lead me to the guesthouse. I'll kick him out at once. Who the hell is he? Father, please. Who is he? Who is my grandson-in-law, the cripple? Come forward now! Calm down, father. This is your grandfather-in-law. You! You fooled your old father again. You imbecile. Look at you, a sensible, dashing young man. Is your father well? Yes, he is. Good. My granddaughter still has a lot to learn but she is precious to me. I wish you a lifetime of happiness. Thank you very much. Let's go, then. - What are you doing? - Father. Let's get to the wedding ceremony. Father, it's not that... Shall I perform the ceremony? Why not? It could be my last chance. My goodness. - Chambong. - Yes, sir. Where are you going? - Nowhere. - Let's do the ceremony. - The bride is not ready. - Is that so? - I shall go and tell her to hurry. - Chambong, you go. I'm going. Chambong, wait. Let's go. Get her ready quickly. Oh my, Sam-dol. Hey, Sam-dol. Sam-dol! - Why so late? - Come here. Your in-laws won't be happy if it takes this long to get ready. Father. Get out of my way. She's coming. Let's wait in the guesthouse. - Yes. - Really? She is ready. Then guide the groom to the ceremony hall. - Stop him from getting there. - Why so slow? Come on. My lady. Let's race to take Lady Gap-bun to the house. Sam-dol! Oops, I missed it. Come here. Clear the way. She's coming. She's coming. - What a happy occasion! - Yes, indeed. Stop it, sir. - Chambong. - Yes, sir. Yes, I'm here. Chambong. Yes. Is that Gap-bun? Thank God. You are here, Gap-bun. You broke your word. You did it again. You fool, I could care less about you right now. Mother. Sweetie. It's all my fault. Sweetie. I'm Ip-bun. I'm a maid. Don't say that. Ip-bun may get married, but it's really you getting married. Sweetie. That is nonsense! You are the daughter-in-law of Minister Kim. Are you even listening to yourself? Live a good life. What did you just say? You swapped your daughter with a maid. Have you gone mad? Don't touch me. I quit. I don't want to work for a lying master. You know, it's not too late to tell the truth and marry off the real Lady Gap-bun. Yes, I should stop the ceremony. Let's go, Gap-bun. I hate you, father. - Gap-bun. - Sweetie. Gap-bun, sweetie. Sweetie, please. Stop! Ouch! My goodness. Gap-bun, my dear! Ouch, my toe! Gosh, my toe! I can't walk. - It hurts so bad. - Father. It's okay. Let's go back. Hello, Jinsa Maeng. You must be sad having married off your daughter. You have to accept your fate. Young lady, you have to find your own path instead of depending on your father's fate. Is there a way to change our fate? You have too much, you lose too much. Here you go. Why don't you try fishing with a straight hook? Fishing with a straight hook? Freedom from avarice is connected to excessive avarice. Even if you let go of your greed and fish with a straight hook, you will catch quite a lot of fish. Father. That looked easy. Why don't we buy a good rod and enjoy fishing from tomorrow? - Okay. - Let's go. Come on, let's go. Lady Gap-bun. Why do you keep avoiding me? Do you not like me? I'm a civilized person. If you don't like me, just tell me so. If not... Fine. You must be tired from the ceremony. Let's go to bed, then. No, I can't do that, sir. What do you mean? My lady. Please. Let go of me. Otherwise, you'll be in big trouble. In trouble? In fact, I am... I am not Gap-bun. What are you saying? You are Lady Gap-bun. You are my wife. How should I put it? Sir, in fact, I am... I am a maid. I'll be punished by Heaven. I knew this was not right but madam turned me into Lady Gap-bun. I'm a fake. I'm nothing but a maid. Is that so? Please forgive me. Lady Gap-bun didn't want to marry you because you were a cripple. So I came instead. I thought you were a cripple. I thought you were a lonely man whom no lady wanted to marry. I'm married to a cripple. My husband is not someone noble and gentle like you. You're not a cripple. You were fooled. Please forgive me. I'm the one who should be asking you for forgiveness. No, you aren't. Do you think I don't know all that? What? You knew? I planned everything. I was the one who asked my uncle to spread the rumor. What? I went too far. I didn't know you'd suffer this much. I would've liked it if you were a cripple. I would've liked it if you were a lonely man. I knew there'd be a woman like you. I believed there'd be a woman like you somewhere in this world. I hope you understand what I've been looking for. I've looked for warm heart, a sincere heart. A lady with a pure heart who can treat cripples or beggars well. I've been with some women obsessed with wealth and some who flatter people in power. I am sick and tired of their shallow minds. I've looked for a lady like you. Whether a lady or a maid, it doesn't change the fact that you are my wife. I am happy to win your genuine affection and to learn the beauty of pure love. For me, the best treasure is a sincere heart. Will you understand that, Lady Ip-bun? Do you see what I'm trying to say? Sir. Don't call me sir. I am your spouse, your husband. Don't ever call me sir. Promise? Yes. All right, so say it. What does a wife call her husband? Come on. Say it. I won't let go until you say it. My dar... My darling. It is a long way to go, so hurry and get ready to leave. It would've been great to have Chambong as an escort, but he's too busy. Don't worry. It's an easy journey, so we will get to the village before sunset. Ip-bun! Goodbye, Ip-bun. Who is that cheeky little one? Get her out, now! Goodbye, young master. Please take good care of Ip-bun. Is there no one? Get her out now! Why is no one dragging her out? - Bye, Ip-bun! - Farewell! Good-bye, newlywed young master. What's wrong with them? Good-bye, Ip-bun. Bye! Good-bye, young master. Bye-bye, newlyweds! I forgot something very important. Yes. Have a safe journey, Ip-bun. Dear grandfather, great grandfather, great-great-grandfather and ancestors. What should I do? Wait a minute. What have I done wrong? I've done no wrong. It's that man's fault, tricking me into thinking his nephew was a cripple. He deserves to be punished by Heaven. How crazy is that, the Minister's son marrying a maid? Take care, Ip-bun. Have a happy life with lots of children. The End
