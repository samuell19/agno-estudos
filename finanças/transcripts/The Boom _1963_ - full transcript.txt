Giovanni, my son... Here, take my savings book. What? Your savings? - You might need it. - Why? - I know you have some problems. - How did you find out? You are such a spendthrift. Well, we spend more than we earn. I'm in debt... Silvia doesn't know anything, but I don't know where to turn. Hello, Gardinazzi! - Hello. Come on, Giovanni! You sleeping? Wake up! Hi, Alberti! Hello, Rudi. Fofo, can you lend me 3 million lire? I'll pay you back in 3 months. Who has such money? OK, forget it. Gotcha! Tell the truth, you believed it? As if I didn't know you. You making fun of me? You, fool! You don't have 3 million? Are you going to pawn your watch? You fatso! I would never refuse to lend money to a friend. Never! Mind you, I would even steal for a friend. Then please, lend me the money, I really need it. Stop it! Don't give me that bull. Sucker. LA FIDES, LOANS COMPANY - Is the Director in? - There he is. - How much did they lend you? - 20,000 lire. What should I do? I'm going to be evicted. Please come in, Mr. Alberti. Please. May I? Good morning, Mr. Turano. A cigarette? Thank you. Mr. Turano, could you... extend the deadline by one month? - No. - No? - No! Fine, thanks all the same. You're welcome. But why? I'm only asking for 30 days. A serious company cannot accept any delay. You've already been privileged. We didn't even demand a personal guarantee. Goodbye. There's nothing to fear. I have mortgaged my house, my furniture, even the toilet. Calm down. We gave you a loan that even a Minister wouldn't get. A Minister would get twice as much. Come on! Our business is none of your concern. Gabbi! Mr. Turano, one month goes by quickly. Today's Monday... You turn around and it's already Sunday! One month is nothing. - Next. - Yes. I must not appear in the register of debtors. My father-in-law is a general and my brother-in-law is a captain. Just pay, then! Sure I will! I told you on the phone. I'll fix everything, I'm starting my own business. My situation is going to change completely. You know how much you can earn in the building trade? At least 50%. And I know all the tricks. All I need is a little money, but I'll find it. Look at me. Do you think I'm an idiot? You think our clients are all idiots? We have managers, professors, whores, industrialists, thieves, a poet, even two priests... and you! We have to treat them all equally. Gabbi, show the gentleman out. No, we're not treated equally. I work! I never thought of getting rich as a loan shark! How dare you make such insinuations against me? The truth is that you spend more than you can earn! Ride a bicycle instead of driving a car! Smoke Italian cigarettes! Let your wife do the dishes, and you will have no debts! Do it yourself! Or let your wife do it! My wife is a lady. A real lady! - Hello, everybody! - It was you? My umbrella got stuck in a crack. - Did you get hurt? - No. Always joking... Why are you late? I was busy. - You don't know what you missed! - Really? Hi, Cinzia. Faravalli! Dronazzi! Gardinazzi! Hello, Giovanni. - Have you seen daddy? - My father? Would your father come here? My father, of course! Look, he's over there! Good morning, General! I'm over here! Riccardo is also there. Riccardo! Hi! - Hi, uncle! - Hi, sweetie! - This guy rides like a god! - Who is he? What's the matter? A little edgy? I knew it! I know how it's going to end. - You have your umbrella. - I always carry it with me. That's wise of you. Here we go - it's raining. Why are we staying here? Let's go. Call Riccardo. Riccardo! Silvia! Silvia! - See you. - Bye-bye. - Where's Riccardo? How's it going? I always pray for you. Thank you, dad. Goodbye, general! Always in great shape! He looks like a kid playing the soldier. Bye, see you tonight. Silvia, come under my umbrella. Riccardo, my dear brother-in-law, I've been looking for you. I have a great deal for you. Why should I give other people this chance, when I can let Riccardo become a rich man? Business is not my cup of tea. - What? And the boom economy? - What about it? But you're not against it, right? Baratti and Faravalli have earned 500 million lire each. - If you say it's little, I'll kill you! - What's that got to do with me? I'm offering you a big deal. If you agree, just say thanks... otherwise, I'll do it myself. - So? - Well... - Is that 'yes' or 'no'? - Yes and no. You must tell me honestly what you're getting at. You're like a politician... doing nothing and getting the bribe. - Stop it! - I'm kidding! You don't understand such things. Lend me 3 million lire and I will carry it out myself. I'm giving you 10%... 20%! - What? You want to swindle a relative? - What are you saying? You're begging everyone for money, signing bad checks... - Who told you that? - Everybody knows it! But Silvia doesn't know. Riccardo... Don't say anything to your sister, it would be a catastrophe! I'll fix everything. Don't worry! Me? I couldn't care less! Riccardo, keep it to yourself. Please, don't say anything! One night a woman wakes up and notices a bald head beside her. Shut up! She says : "It's not my husband." I know that one! It's vulgar! Yes, so vulgar. - Go on... - Wait. Giovanni, don't! Isn't she lovely? Okay, I give up. Giovanni, we don't work together anymore, do we? Silvia doesn't want us to. I'd be in trouble... He never tells you jokes? - Never. - Too bad, he knows some great ones! - Come on, Giovanni! - No... Let's hear it. Amuse me too. It's not my fault, then. They want to hear it, Silvia. So, the woman wakes up and notices a bald head. "It's not my husband", she says. "My husband is rather hairy." "I'm going to scream." But she's not the rushy type, so, before screaming, she decides to take a look. "Is this him or not?", she says, reaching with her hand... "Is this him or not?" "Is this him or not?" "Wonderful, it's not him!" - Did you just touch my leg? - No, you fool. I thought so... Did you like the joke? You didn't get it because you weren't listening. What are you thinking about? Don't you get it? It is not her husband. My turn to tell one. It takes place in the Mexican countryside. Three friends, Pablo, Luisito and Giaco meet each other. They decide to play a game. Pablo suggests golf. "What's that?" "To play golf you need a club, a ball and a hole." "I will be the club." "OK", Luis says. "I will be the ball." The third says: "I won't play!' That's a good one! Enough with jokes. Where shall we go tonight? - To Samovar. - Great! - Where shall we go, Silvia? - You decide. Sir, the bitter bill. Bausetti! Bausetti? Dronazzi, who is he? - Bausetti. You know how many billions he has? - How many? - Try to guess. - 100? - 300! He's invested in Acquacetosa, Italcementi, La Fides... La Fides? Mr. and Mrs. Bausetti. - You look younger every day! - My dear! This is Giovanni. Giovanni Alberti. Pleased to meet you. - My respects, Madam. - Good evening. A little flower. A little flower. A little flower, Madam. Here, keep the change. Please, Madam. - You are so kind. - You're welcome. - Good night, Sir. - Goodbye. Sweetheart... Hi, Giovanni. - Having fun? - Yes. Shall we go see the faggots? OK, let's go. That silly girl is full of surprises. What's wrong, Giovanni? You're a monster - you can't stop thinking about Silvia. Don't exaggerate now. Fancy a little ride with me? Cutie! Would you like to keep me company? - I was thinking... - One feels a better person here. That's true. The Pope is right... Peace! Peace! Help each other, help. I'd like to talk to you. Where will you be tomorrow? I'll be on the construction site until 11am. Then in the office. I haven't told anyone about this. It came up like a joke but it could grow into something amazing. A stretch of land near Camilluccia. 1,000 lire per square meter. It might be worth 20,000 lire overnight. I'll tell you how. We offer 3 hectares to Saint Maurizio monks. They build a convent and a hospice. Then the City will supply the water, electricity, roads... All of a sudden, the price goes up! - It's a great opportunity. - Marvellous. But I'm not interested. It's the best deal I've come across this year! I'm not interested. I will give you a regular 4-months promissory note... out of the whole sum. Why don't you go ask Baratti? You've been working together for years. Never mind, Faravalli. I really hoped you would accept... because I know you are... a damn bastard. Time to go beddy-byes. No, let's go and take a look at Rome from the Gianicolo Hill. Shall we go to your place? - What shall we do, then? - Let's go and dance the twist. - Is your headache gone? - Completely. Are you coming to Castiglioncello this summer? No, I prefer Fregene. It's full of faggots there. They're everywhere, anyway. - Are you going to play now? - Yes. Cinzia, we are ready. Please, excuse me. Here I am. - Are you playing cards? - Yes. I will throw you all out at 2am. I have to be at the construction site at 8am. Do you have a minute? - Turn off the record player, will you? - Sure. - Giovanni, just turn down the volume. - Turn down the volume? Come. What cards you gave me! You could've dealt a better hand. - A Boom? - What's that? - A 'cool' cocktail drink. - OK, honey. Some gin, please. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - I finally got rid of that woman. - We don't care a bit! Silvia, why don't we have some tea together, tomorrow? I can't. I have to go to the hairdresser's. I have so many things to do... - Say something, Giovanni. - What can I say? Pour yourself a whisky. No, thanks. Do you want some? Thanks, no ice. How long have we known each other? Four years. Why don't you and Silvia come to Castiglioncello this summer? We have two extra rooms in our villa. Why not? Thank you. Baratti... I've been working for you... and your company for the past four years. Four years of collaboration... based not only on our work, but also on friendship. However, I've never asked you a favour. Unfortunately, the cost of living and our needs... have increased and I eventually... had to go into debt. Debts that I must face now with great urgency. Who can I ask for help if not a friend? And our friendship is based on mutual respect... - You hold me in high esteem, don't you? - Sure... Our wives, Silvia and Cinzia, are also good friends, but... Silvia doesn't know anything about it, she thinks she's like your wife, but you're filthy rich, whereas I'm without a penny. Still, Silvia is such a classy woman that I can't tell her... to give up Christmas holidays in Cortina and stay home... playing bingo with our relatives. I can't tell her: "You can't buy new clothes". I simply can't. Unfortunately, our wives are those kinds of women... who are used to living in luxury. So, how can I tell her: "Enough. It's over. We can't go on like this." She wouldn't understand. So, I'm forced to... ask a friend for help, telling him: "My friend..." I have no king. "My friend..." Otherwise, I would have played it, of course. Giovanni... Giovanni, don't drink. The tailor told me you haven't paid her yet? Big payments should be put off for later. Everyone does it. The more you delay, the less you pay. Think about the inflation... How much did a steak cost last year? I have no idea, honey. Everything's going up: oil, butter, grapefruits... Grapefruits? You're right. The doctor told me that they're more healthy than oranges. Sure. I'm sleepy. What a night! The twist really kills you. Turn around! You're so beautiful! You know it's almost 4am? Why do you put on those creams? Your skin drives me crazy. Aren't you ashamed of being so beautiful? Be serious! Have you reserved that house in Fregene? Yes... I'm going to. Other people could reserve it first. No, don't worry. If you lend me your car, I'll go myself to Fregene tomorrow. O Jesus, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, Oh, good Jesus, I will not offend Thee anymore. With Jesus' blood, I hope to save my soul. What the hell am I going to tell her? I'm selling my car tomorrow. I've found a buyer. Are you selling it? Yes, I decided to buy a faster one. With 8-cylinders. What do you say? Meanwhile, you will walk? Don't be silly. I'll go by taxi. What will the others say when they see you in a taxi? Why should I care? You'll see my new car. And I'll buy a new Fiat 500 for you. All yours. OK? Thanks. I'll need it for sure. Good night, Giovanni. Don't touch me with your feet tonight. They're always so cold... - Silvia... - Yes? Do you really love me? What a question, darling! Of course I do. But how much? A lot? Like Indian women? Why? What do they do? They never leave their husbands. In bad or good times. When their husbands die, they burn themselves as well. And their children? Who takes care of them? Someone must stay with them. If I told you: "Let's change our lives." "Let's move south." "To Catanzaro"? I must go to sleep now or I won't get a bit of rest. But why Catanzaro? Southern Italy is less expensive. But we're all fine here. Besides... Southern Italy... No way... Be nice, Giovanni, I'm all washed out. Bye... Bye. What's wrong with you tonight? Nothing. Only 220,500 lire. I can do nothing with it. - What happened? - A five-metre fall. Don't they use any protection, these bastards? BAUSETTI COMPANY Excuse me. Good morning, sir. Who is he? The church should be moved to the left, it shadows the other buildings. - Farther to the North, come on! - Very well, Mr. Bausetti. Excuse me... It will break in 2 years. But it's 2% less. At least, paint it green. White is so sad... like a hospital! Please, come forward. You work for Baratti? Yes, I do. We met last night. Don't you remember? Baratti is expanding. Expanding? That's true. But I came here on my own behalf, Sir. So? Well... There's a plot of land near Camilluccia. 1,000 lire per square meter, an incredible price. I know, 30 kilometers from Rome. Exactly. You know that place? I put an option on it a year ago. I'm offering you this deal, as a joint venture if you wish. Nobody would build there. There are no roads, no water, nothing... Here's the idea, Sir. It's 20 hectares of land. We... - I said "we" as if we already... - Go on. We will offer 2 hectares to Saint Maurizio monks. - Why? - In order to build a new convent with guestrooms. I already discussed it with the supervisor, my father-in-law's friend. The City will supply the water, the roads and the plumbing... and the price goes up one hundred times as much! Enough, young man! Goodbye! All of you young men, with such ideas, you want to earn in one year what we have earned in 50! I've been working hard for 50 years. I started when I was 20. Just imagine! This boom will drive you all nuts! You have to pay your dues to succeed! I know. You are a god. I'll treasure your advice. But you can help me. I have a deadline at La Fides. What's that got to do with me? I've never heard of La Fides! Who the hell are you? - Carlo! - Hi. What's wrong? He says I have some connections with La Fides. How dare you? That's what I've been told. I'm sorry. Nothing but lies! I've never been a loan shark! What do you want, Mr...? Alberti, Ma'am. We met last night, don't you remember? Ah, yes. I remember. You gave me a flower. I remember. Yes, I remember. He got angry because I asked him... to put in a good word for me at La Fides. I have a deadline. Excuse me. If I gave just 10 lire to everyone who asks money from me, I'd turn into a beggar! Get out of here! I'm Bausetti, not La Fides. I'm not interested in them. Bring me those other bidets. Tell that idiot of Nardelli. Wait. What do you think about this bidet? Awful. My husband is right. There are different ones, recently designed. My husband is right. People keep asking for help. I didn't ask for money, Madam. Just for a good word at La Fides. Never mention La Fides! My husband has absolutely nothing to do with them. Then I'm ruined, Madam. Don't give in, Mr... Alberti. Giovanni Alberti. Mr. Alberti, there might be a way out. Thank you, Madam. We could talk about it. What are you doing later? "What are you doing later?" Nothing special. Then, come over... - Where? - To my house. I will be alone. 118, Archimedes Street. At 4pm, OK? It's like a dream. I will be there. At 4pm. So, we agree on that. Those with chromatic faucets. This one is terrible! You heard my wife? Sure, Dolfi bidets are more elegant and modern. They must be appealing. - So, use the Dolfis. - Yes. You heard my wife? Use the Dolfis. - Make her happy. - Very well. - They're terrible! - My respects. We can assure you that our representative G. Alberti... will repay his debts before or no later than tomorrow. Thank you. Yours faithfully... Trim my nose hairs... And my ears, too. Have you finished? Come on, hurry up. My wife? Hey, sweetheart. You wanted to surprise me? How's Carletto? What's wrong? What's with your voice? Tell me. Just say something nice to your husband. Everything is going well for your husband and you make a fuss? I can't. I have some important business to take care of at 4pm. Where were you born? In Rome, Madam. - My husband's from Recanati. - Gigli's hometown. And Leopardi's. You're right. He bawls and bawls, but he's a good man. Does the light bother you? No. You haven't told anyone you were coming here? No one. Would you like something to drink? A little coffee? Yes, thanks. You're healthy, it's evident. Have you ever been sick? Never, Madam. I liked you since the moment I met you. You're a good, honest person. I don't want to waste your time. I'll get straight to the point. Why should I...? Two cups of coffee, Piero. ...beat around the bush? You should appreciate my frankness... which is proof of my respect. Of course, I know. But all this must remain between us. I don't know you. I've never seen you. All right? All right. I advise you not to say anything to your wife either. Or anyone else. I won't. Don't worry. I realize that what I'm about to ask might shock you. You... Would you sell an eye? My goodness, don't be shocked! You can reply whatever you like, by all means. Excuse me... Excuse me... We are here like good and intimate friends. I didn't say you must sell your eye, you're a free man! We no longer live in the time of slavery. - I hope I didn't offend you? - No. - Really? - No. Clearly, I made a mistake. Please, forgive me. Try to understand, I said to myself: "Who knows? This gentleman might agree." Thank God, money isn't a problem. I thought you could sort everything out and settle down. In the 30's, we were in debt as well. We used to lose our sleep. Put it here. You may go. How many lumps? Four. Don't think I haven't considered the pros and cons. How bitter... I properly assessed the situation. If we had any kind of financial problem, we would choose a standard solution. Some people even include eye donation in their will. They are saints! Giving them away for free... But Bausetti would never accept. Nowadays, they've even started using oxen. - No way! - Yes. An ox's cornea. Can you imagine? We're willing to undertake any sacrifice, but only if it's someone we know very well, otherwise we won't do it. 30, 40 or 50 millions. Please, tell me. Be frank with me. I really want you to trust me completely. Tell me. We aren't doing this on a whim. My husband has many responsibilities. In his work, you need not two, but three eyes. What bad luck! Last year, on a construction site, a squirt of quicklime... A little squirt of quicklime... - Granny! - Hi, darling! Hi, darling. Granny will be right with you. Excuse us. Naughty little devil... Come here, Raimondo! Raimondo! Who is he? Sorry, mom. Sorry, Sir. My son, Mister... - Giovanni Alberti. - Nice to meet you. Let's go. I have to go too. - So, what do you say? - What should I say? Would you like to think it over? A day, two, three. But not longer than that, because we have our obligations. Three months ago, we had a donor, but then he left. He went to Belgium to work in a mine. We should be able to find him. Well, goodbye. A little phone call, whenever you want. These things can't be arranged legally, of course. We have a friend, a doctor. A true friend. An ace doctor. - So, will you call? - I don't know. - How old is your son? - He's two. The best years of one's life! What political party do you support? I'm not interested in politics. You're a wise man, Mr. Alberti! Goddamn her! "Would you sell one of your eyes?" What a bitch... Silvia! What is it? Be strong, Silvia, come on! What's the matter? What happened? - Don't despair. God will help you. - Silvia! We know everything, Giovanni. You're up to your neck in debts! It's not like it used to be. Nowadays, even policemen get into debt! You're ruined! Who said that? Everyone knew it. Everyone, except us! It's a shame! You're registered as a debtor! Look! They're going to seize our furniture. Right until last night, he lied to me! He was talking about inflation, grapefruits. I said nothing because I didn't want you to worry. I hoped I could sort it all out before you... And I will! I love you, Silvia. Yeah, sure. - Should we tell him everything, daddy? - Yes. You mortgaged our flat. My flat! We're broke. We don't even have a roof over our heads! Prattle! Three years of prittle-prattle. It's ridiculous. And I married him because I believed in his bright future! Do you understand? What a fool I am! I warned you. You shouldn't have given him power of attorney. I've been fooled! "Give me POA. I will take care of everything!" Idiot! Moron! No, Silvia! Silvia... Do you realize... This situation is being discussed even at the Ministry. Shame on you! The South... He wanted to take me to Catanzaro! Indian women... He even dared to play the witty man! He's always joking! If only you hadn't quit that job at the Ministry. Little, yet safe money! "One day, I will be..." You don't have what it takes! Dad, we must take action! Silvia, try to understand. You've always had everything you wanted, you can't deny it. We're going through difficult times, it's not the end! We'll fix everything! You can't fix anything! You're useless! There must be someone willing to help us, among our friends! Right! They'll help us for sure! Maybe they'll help you! Go ahead! Do you think I'm an idiot? You think they're our friends because I tell jokes? You know what? I'm coming too! Then we can all play children's games! You've lost everything! Keep your manners, at least! I'm leaving! Do you know where I come from? I don't give a damn! I just know that I'm going away! - Then go! - Forever! I won't be here when they take our house! And don't come looking for me! Let's go, dad. Sir! Hello? It's Alberti. I want to talk to my wife. - She's sleeping. - Wake her up. The General... doesn't want to. The General... OK, I got it. Hello? Is Mrs. Bausetti there? This is Alberti. Giovanni Alberti. - Please, wait one moment. - All right. Hello, Alberti? Madam, it's me. A, E. N, V, F, E pointing up, E pointing left. T, L, C, F, O, P. E pointing down, E pointing left, E pointing up, E pointing right. Fantastic! You have an eagle eye! A wonderful eye. You're one of the healthiest men I've ever met! - No, no... - A serious man as well. Sir, how about Monday? Monday? Next Monday? What? Even this... Sir! Come on! The sooner, the better, right? After that, we'll have a nice dinner together. We're almost like a family! Saturday would suit me fine. Then I could tell my wife that I have something important to do, in Livorno, for instance. I must make up an excuse. You'll find one easily. What do you advise me to do, Professor? A little accident, a fall, can cause eye congestion... Actually, I was thinking about a car accident. You would smash your car? The windshield is enough. A piece of glass... Well.. you can tell them you fell asleep and hit a tree. So there will be no witnesses. Are you insured? What are you talking about? The insurance companies check on everything. - So... Saturday 22nd at 8am. - Saturday? By the way, don't eat or drink too much on Friday. You too, of course. And absolute fasting on Saturday morning! It's very important. Otherwise, we'll have to postpone the operation... which inevitably leads to complications. - Carlo! - What's wrong? What are you doing? Stop acting like a child! Put that eye down! - What? - What are you doing? - It's nothing. A little bit of Coramina, Rosetta. - Carlo... Have I shocked you? Carlo, darling... In a week, you will be my old Carlo again, with his two bright eyes. - Who knows what happened? I feel better now. - Good. - Sorry. - Not at all! It's only human! Annetta, come here. You can go now. We'll leave you alone. Sometimes, he's so childish... You're good-natured, instead. Take a seat. Let's talk business, then. Tell us your price. 1 billion lire. - 50 million lire is too little, though. - Better than nothing! Come on, be serious! We won't look at you while you tell us your price, we'll turn to the wall. - What? - So? We're talking about an eye here! You see, personally, I would never sell my leg. When you have legs, you can go wherever you like. If fire breaks out, you can run. I'm so afraid of fire! Madam, I don't want to stay here and talk about this any longer. I've already made my decision, but let me think about... Can I say it? I'm a pleasant man. But what will happen afterwards? I have a young and beautiful wife. If your wife truly cares about you... then this is the right time to test her love for you. But an eye is an eye! If you look at a bottle, that bottle over there, for instance... Come here! Close your eye. You won't say "it's a bot", you'll say "it's a bottle". Besides, it's not your right eye. You must be kidding! Right or left, it's my eye. You know that you can drive a car with just one eye. Well, I admit it... without your left eye... you might have some difficulty at overtaking. Still, with your right eye, you can drive easily. Anyway, the less you overtake, the better. How about 55 million, Mr. Alberti? 70. Don't say anything, I need money. Otherwise, I might change my mind. You're so haughty! All right, as you wish. A 10% down payment, you agree? No, it's not enough. 20%? It's OK. It's a proof of trust. You might disappear. I'm kidding. We know you're a true gentleman. Cash-in-hand. - All right. - Cheques go around, you know? We're doing this for your sake. Selling body parts is illegal. All or nothing. Please, write your signature... on this little bill of exchange. A pure formality. You see... We must keep some evidence. We'll give it back to you on Saturday. Mom, I'm giving you back your savings book. But I was glad I could help you. I've had some financial problems. Like everybody else, nowadays. I bought you something. Guess what. You're just spending money, as you always do. A "Chippendale" dining room suite. Are you happy? And you? I've been very lucky. Things couldn't have gone better. I made an excellent deal. I found a partner who trusted me, and now he can't manage things without me. He puts up the money and I... I just work. - Is it true? - Sure! My life has changed completely. Your wife should kiss the ground you walk on. You're so good, Giovanni. Mom, I have something to tell you. - I'm getting a divorce. - Divorce? She left and took the kid with her. I'm getting divorced. She left? Yes, she went back to her father. They turned her against me, the General and that scoundrel... of a brother of hers, telling everyone that I was ruined. But they need to try harder! I've got an iron will, mom! They never believed in me. Now, I want to get my satisfaction! I've got a pile of millions this high. But you must help me, mom. Sure, my son. You'll go see the General and tell him that I want a divorce. Before that, you must tell him I paid all my debts. We all go through difficult times. If only you'd seen how they treated me yesterday... Just like an old rag! But I'm madly in love, damn it! Yes. I will go. I will go. See your daddy? Look at him. Look! Silvia. Giovanni... How...? They're always in such a hurry... General... Let's make peace. Sure, but let's move away from here, first. Giovanni, God helped you. I know. You know what your first duty is? Come with us tonight. - Where? - To Santa Domitilla. Oh, Blessed Virgin Pray for me Hail Mary, Full of Grace, The Lord is with thee... Blessed Virgin, only you and I know how things really are. Anyway, what else could I do? I have an agreement now. You are the only one who can help me. See what you can do, change their minds if you can. I don't know... kill them. No? Some illness then... Do what you like. Scare them, so that they give up. - Giovanni... - Yes? Oh, graceful Virgin... Look at dad. He's so happy. Dad is right. You must thank the Lord. You can't always ask, you must also give something back, right? Sure. I'm so happy. And you? Me too. Don't you feel like a new man? Freer and calmer? Mr. Alberti, everything's ready. Ready! - The buffet is ready, this way! - Yes! Friends, help yourselves... There's everything. Delicious meat... Crayfish, caviar... - What a buffet! - At least half a million lire! Have you seen what's over there? It looks tastier. Excuse me. Can't you see there's plenty of it? What about you? Don't worry about me. I'll eat later. Is this cod? No, it's crayfish. Your dad might give you cod. Enough now. Let her stay, she has to learn... Can't she ever shut her mouth? Stop getting at her! You make mistakes too. If you'd lent him some money, you'd be partners now. I don't believe in strokes of luck. I believe what I see. Get lost, you idiot... The old rifleman of the Volga always smells caviar, doesn't he? We used to eat a lot of it in Russia. We had no bread, but we had caviar every day. And vodka, right? My friends, drink vodka! - Thank you, Giovanni. - Thank you, Giovanni. Don't worry. Mom, dad! What are you doing? Come here! See, General? The Russians make propaganda using vodka and caviar. What do they make of it? We're all socialists. I'm not. I wish I was, but I have too much money. And you're stingy! For mom and dad. Is it an anniversary or what? No, it's not an anniversary. Another baby? Oh my goodness, no! Just for the pleasure of having you all here. And we have an important announcement. But be patient. Right, Giovanni? Wait a minute. What a party! Are you enjoying yourselves? It's wonderful, my dear son. Who knows how much it's going to cost you! Look! Is everyone served? Cheers! Everyone should drink. This is my big night. Have fun, drink! Here's your drink, darling. Try to forget that fatso over there. Leaving a chick like you alone for that piece of turkey... You know what? He makes me sick! Your husband's laughing too. He agrees. Ol�, bull! Having fun? - A lot. - Good! I'm sorry, the buffet is all yours... but Silvia is all mine tonight. And you know what? I've never liked that wife swapping game. What are you saying?! You know why? Because I always lose. Why? Aren't you the most beautiful woman on Earth? Giovanni, why didn't you tell us? Is this the way you do things? We've been working together for many years. What's this "Alberti & Co." ? Who told you about it? Was it you, Silvia? Yes, you should have seen their faces! They couldn't believe it, so I had to show them the paper. Alberti & Co., with fully paid-up capital. Alberti & Co, 18, Via del Vicario. I'm so happy, tonight! Is this what you wanted, Silvia? I'm happy, because I feel so safe beside you. Bravo, Giovanni! I was sure you would make it. Now we've got a tremendous competitor: Alberti & Co. Nevertheless, Giovanni should've told us about his initiative. Faravalli and I were ready to become your partners. When there's business to make, why should you offer it to someone else? You wanted me to offer it to you? Excuse me, Baratti, but you've never allowed me to get involved in your business. And what business! Such speculations! Right, you sly old fox? And I really needed that money! That 1% I get from selling your apartments, makes 250 or 300,000 lire a month, at the most. Yet, we used to live the same way, we went out and we laughed together. We used to eat out and I always paid my share. Where did you think I was getting the money from, in order to live like you? Because... When I asked you to help me... You turned on your heels and ran away. Even Silvia left me and went back to her father. Right? Stop it Giovanni, it's all over now. I'm saying this because my friends, instead of helping me out, told you that I was ruined, and that I asked everyone for money. Is it true, Riccardo? Whistle-blowers! - Are you drunk? - Not at all. Look, I can keep my balance on one leg right until tomorrow. Giovanni, look! There's no God! He does exist, General. I said that because of the Franciscan over there. Excuse me, don't you have a wife? You're always alone... Does she work at night? It's pretty humid at night on that balcony. Why don't you put on a hat? Faravalli, give him yours. Giovanni, enough now! Stop it! What are you doing? You leaving, my friends? I'm just kidding. Aren't you laughing anymore? Now that I don't need to ask you any favour? I'm rich, Baratti. Now, I'm rich! Giovanni... Starting tomorrow, I will make a fortune. Tomorrow, I'll make the most important deal in my life! Aren't you going to wish me luck? Won't you support me and say: "Bravo, Alberti & Co!" ? Let's drink, then! Let's have fun! Orchestra, play up! - Giovanni... - Mom. You leaving already? The party has just started. They always stay on the sidelines. They are the only ones who are unaware of this boom! We've all gone mad, but they haven't noticed anything. They're happy. They have faith in me. You, General, instead... Tell me the truth. You always said I would end up in rags. - We're leaving. Good night. - Goodbye. Dronazzi, Baratti, Faravalli, I'm richer than you! - See you, and please forgive him. - Goodbye, Silvia. Goodbye, Silvia. Goodbye, General. - Forgive him. - It's nothing at all. Forgive him, dad. The alcohol makes him sick. - I understand, but he should mind his manners. - You're right. They've left. Silvia! Silvia! Silvia! Time for beddy-byes! Tidy everything up. Then you can leave, it's already late. Why aren't you in bed? Do you know what time it is? When there's a moon, I never go to bed alone, don't you know? You're my wife. Can't I look at the moon? Giovanni, haven't you done enough for tonight? You've ruined the whole party. You offended everyone. Why did you do it? My poor daddy was speechless... Daddy? Shut up, you dummy! Never mind. Sit down and enjoy yourselves! Sing. Play me a song. Rome, don't fool me tonight Give me a hand to make her say yes... Marta. Marta, get out of here. Madam! Go, I don't need you anymore. I have no one but you, Silvia. Why are you doing this? You say I behaved badly tonight? - Yes, very badly. - No! I treated them the way they deserved. Because no one was kind to me. Neither your father, nor you. Remember! But I don't care about them. I get rid of them easily! I can't live without you, Silvia. I would do anything to make you happy. I said anything! And what do I ask in return? Just your love. You never had any reason to doubt my love for you. But I want to be sure that you will love me forever. Sure. I will. How long? What if one day I became... uglier? - What? - One day I'll be uglier. Me too. I will get old and I will be ugly. What if something happened to me? I want to know if I can count on you? Because no one in this world... No one would do what I'm about to do. - Calm down, I don't understand you! - You have to. I have to be sure I can count on you. How can I say... For instance... Look. Look what I'm doing. Look. There. - What? - Well... My arm. If I showed up like this, would you still love me? Giovanni... get in bed. You're drunk. Get in bed. You will love me even without an arm? Even without... - I have to tell you! - I already know. I must tell you. But how? I love you. - I love you, Silvia. - Calm down. Giovanni... All these things you're taking along, your swimming trunks, the harpoon gun, will you need them? Of course I will. Livorno is a seaside town. But with everything you have to do there, will you have the time? I don't know. I don't even want to go. Look, you didn't even put your necktie on. What's wrong? What's wrong? Don't you see it's springtime. What a sky! Be careful. You're always overhasty when I'm not around. With all these car accidents... It doesn't depend on us. When your time has come... Hush. Don't say such things. I'm going to say goodbye to the kid. He's sleeping. Don't wake him up. Giovanni... Giovanni... Shhhh... I made a zabaglione for you, with fresh eggs. Thank you. - My God, what did you give me? - Beaten eggs. - I mustn't eat anything. - Why? What? Are you kidding? You mustn't eat anything before going on a trip. I had no idea. That's what they told me. You mustn't eat anything before going on a trip. You're joking. - You think I'm kidding? - Bye. - Bye. - Have a good trip. - Yeah, sure. Listen... Are you going to see my mother today? Of course I will. Giovanni, now that you had the last laugh, buy a little present for daddy. A little something. A panforte cake, he adores it. You'll make him happy. - A panforte cake? - Yes. Bye. Bye. Silvia, listen. Put the chain on the door and don't open to anyone. Of course. Bye, my dear. - Bye. - Bye. - What's wrong? - I'm not going. You little fool! Focus on your business and show them what you're made of. Bye. Follow me. You're from Rome? Yes, I am. I'm not. This way. Please. Good morning. - How are you doing? - I'm okay but it's hot. This way. Yes, it's very hot. Too hot. Too hot. You're sweating. Morally, I'm a strong man. It's the pain that scares me. Come on, Tammimabumba! In Africa, they called him Tammimabumba. It means "Man-God". I was in charge of 1,000 men. Africa's largest construction sites. We built roads, bridges... But I'm oversensitive when I see a scalpel. He doesn't even go to the dentist. Once, I had a root canal removed without anesthesia. How can you be so brave? You kidding? I'm shitting bricks. Come on. What are you doing? Excuse me. How long is it going to take? Not very long. Where are you going? I have to call my wife. Hello, Miss? 51-38-16-9. 9. - Where is he? - On the phone. Hello? There she is. Silvia, it's me, Giovanni! I just wanted to say hi and send you a kiss. Thanks, you're so sweet. It's nice of you to call me, I'm less worried now. Me too. Silvia, are you happy? Yes I am, darling. And you? I'm not. I'm not happy when you're not with me. Then come back soon. Please, don't make me worry. What? The sea. It's still cold and you have rheumatism. Haven't you noticed something? I forgot to give you the flippers! Don't worry, I won't need them. Silvia, I have to go. OK. Bye, Giovanni. I'm going... I'm going... Giovanni? Giovanni? Dad, he forgot to hang up. - Where to? - This way. Prepare the anesthesia. Lay down. - Lay down. - Yes. Tammimabumba. That's it. Mr. Bausetti? You are the famous Bausetti? Lucky you! Please, lay down. Thanks. I'm afraid of anesthesia more than the rest... because of the feeling of suffocating, you understand? Is it okay if I'm on a first-name basis with you? Alberti! Call me by my first name. It's okay with me. You can... no problem! Professor! Alberti! - Push the button! - I don't have a coin! Get out of here! Everyone out! Leave me alone with this gentleman. - What are you doing here? - I'm going up. Would you mind leaving us alone for a minute? Close the door! This is completely childish! You disappointed me! Shame on you! What do you plan to do now? Look at me! I will give you the money back, I'll pay by instalments. Where will you get the money? I'll cash the bill of exchange right away! In an hour, you'll be ruined! I don't want to lose my eye! Be quiet. Don't make a scene here in the elevator. Listen, Alberti. This is a fraud. We have enough money to stand up to anything. Sue me if you like, what can I say? I don't want to cheat anyone. I'm just scared. You know what? Do whatever you want. Sue me, I will tell everything. What do you mean by everything? Everything! It's unfair. You can't force a man to sell his eye. Who forced you? Honestly, who forced you? Do tell me. Please, don't think badly of me. Why did you accept it? I said, why did you take the money? I needed it. And now you don't? I still do! Are you kidding? Mr. Alberti, listen to me. Later, you can decide however you like. Think it over. Calm down. I could be your mother. What are you going to do later? I know your situation better than you, don't fool yourself. No one gives you credit any more, not even the baker. What next? Are you going to put an ad in the newspaper? Or knock on your friends' doors? You have no other choice left. You've got a family, think about it. Think about your wife, especially about her. Take a look. As a token of trust, I'm giving you the cheque now. Here. Take it! What more can I do for you? All right? Phew... it's gone. Everything's alright now. Isn't it? Yes. Put on these glasses. Darn it, do you have 5 lire? Not yet. Nice one, Alberti! That's more like you! You're great! Everything's fine. What happened? Nothing. Move along, please. Move along. Let us through. What happened? Nothing. He got a bit scared. It happens. - Let's cross the street. - Sure. What happened, Madam? Stop! Through the crosswalk. THE END
