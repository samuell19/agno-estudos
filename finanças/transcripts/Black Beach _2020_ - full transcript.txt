NETFLIX PRESENTS What are you doing? Hmm. I've got to get to work. Stop. No. - I'll be home by seven. - No. Hey. Get back here and finish. Good morning. How are you? Thank you. You never stayed here before. Just to say goodbye before you go to New York. I'm not leaving yet. Will it do? Just in time. Things surface when they surface. So, what are you hoping for? A boy or a girl? It's a girl. - Un Americanita. - Hmm. - Breakfast is on me. - Thank you. - Carlos? - Hi, Graham. - Lower the offer 35%. - Are you sure? He's almost here. - Trust me, I'm sure. - Okay. - Put Peter on, please. - Sure, hang on. Sorry to keep you all waiting. Can we speak, uh, in private? I don't think that's necessary. What's this? Out. Are there more copies of this shit? Are you going to take the offer? You scumbags. Good thing you're going to New York. I was starting to worry about my job. So, I got the promotion, then? - Maybe. - Seriously? Still dangling a fucking carrot. Just keep dicking me around. No, don't laugh. Make a decision, you can shove it up your ass. Or I go to Price. There's no fun over there. By the way, I invited Graham. Oh. Let's see what he says. Because they need an answer in New York. And? And what? I can't keep them waiting any longer. Say yes. What's the problem? And if you don't get the okay? Who do you think you're talking to? I'll go without you if you don't get the promotion. Go without me. You won't find anybody as elegant. Thank you. - Always unpredictable. - Mom. There he is. Congratulations, Elena. Oh, my dear. Thank you so much. - You look beautiful. - Merci. - Oh, my God. - What about me? Oh, look at you. - Congratulations, Mom. - Thank you, darling. Thank you so much. - Ah… - Congratulations, Elena. Thank you, Graham. Congratulations, really. - Susan, how are you? - Thank you. Thank you. You're so kind. Merci. Upon receiving this medal, the most esteemed recognition offered by a country I love so much, I experienced the same sensation as when I was appointed High Commissioner of the United States for Human Rights. Fear, mixed with a sense of responsibility, and pride. Yes, fear of not being able to live up to the enormous trust placed in me. My sense of responsibility that simply won't allow me to take a step back. And pride. I'm proud of the great honor that has been bestowed upon me by the United Nations. …security issues, that's all. - Don't worry, this'll be fixed... - Am I interrupting? - Hey. - We were waiting for you. Mr. Donovan, hi. Listen. I don't know if you're aware of the deal we're trying to negotiate with President Ndong? Vaguely. The biggest pocket of oil I've ever seen, and I have seen fucking plenty. What we need now is to finally get that embargo on oil sales lifted so we can cash in. Yeah, the UN envoy is there right now, finishing a report. We're almost there. We've just spent 15 million lobbying the United Nations to cast Ndong as a democrat. We even fucking stuffed the ballot boxes, for Christ's sake. - Well, so, what's the problem? - A Zande terrorist group. - Ethnic rivals of the group of Ndong. - Right. They just kidnapped an oil refinery engineer. The MIA? - They're a joke. - Yeah. Didn't Ndong eliminate most of them? Yeah, well, they're a joke that can massively fuck things up for us. He missed one, Calixto Batete, and he can ruin everything. They wanna rock the boat, and they probably will. That's why we have to handle this with care. We just stopped President Ndong from going on television and making some speech about threatening to wipe out the entire Zande population if they don't release this engineer guy. Yeah, and if this moron turns the country into a bloodbath, we can't lift the embargo, and it's all over. Okay, first of all, he should leave the country. Exactly. Listen, Carlos, you're familiar with that country, so I need you there, all right? Make sure everything goes smoothly. What the fuck was that about? I've never done anything like this in my life. You are a negotiator. You grew up on the United Nations, and you know the country. Come on, three months working for an NGO, that's it. I know about buying and selling companies, period. You don't have to get your hands dirty. Just keep the peace down there is all till we can lift that embargo. I knew Calixto Batete. I knew him really well. He's got nothing to do with politics. No way. Well, people change. You're not the backpacker you once were either. You know Susan's due in 24 days. Well, you can put the pedal down when you want to. Everything okay? Your husband has to take a little business trip, and he's getting frustrated. Oh, no, no, no, no, he's not going anywhere. Worth his while. This will be very good for both of you. How good? New York good? Yes, and becoming partner good too. Did you hear that? - What is it? - Oh. Nothing. Perhaps we can go with you. Yeah, sure. And what if you have to outrun a lion? There are no lions there. The alleged kidnapper, I used to know him. He was my friend. Don't go if you think it's dangerous. Accept that job in New York. Hmm? Hello. Douglas Mackinnon, Stoneoil executive director. Pleasure. - Stefan Goiris, chief of security. - Nice to meet you. - Has the negotiator arrived? - Yes, they're all here. - Thank you. - We were waiting for you. Park in lot three. - Any word from the kidnappers yet? - No, nothing yet. Good morning. Hello. General William Mba. On behalf of this great democratic republic, it's my honor to welcome you. The honor is mine, General. Our negotiating team. Leo Babich. Very pleased to meet you. - Pleasure. - Please join us. Hello, everyone. I suppose you read the reports, and you're up to date on our most recent investigations. What I don't understand is why they haven't made contact yet. We need to be patient. Kidnappings in Africa are often slow to develop. Well, this one we'll have to speed up. No time to spare, gentlemen. We must pay whatever they ask for, and if they need to leave the country, we'll help them do that. No tricks, no traps. There is always the possibility that their motives aren't so much economic as political in nature. That could complicate the negotiation considerably. The few remaining members of the MIA are exiled in France, and they're not claiming responsibility. There's a new faction led by young radicalized Zandes, among them, Calixto Batete. - Why not claim responsibility? - Zandes are unpredictable. They don't adhere to rules of logic. Maybe there's something else. The kidnapping could have gotten out of hand. What are you driving at? They killed him already? We're on an island with a lot of vegetation. It would be easy to get rid of the body. Very easy. Our priority is to locate whoever did this. Once we locate them, we will know where Steve Campbell is. General, have you read the memorandum? Don't worry about the United Nations envoy. I'm not worried, General. I trust you. But we need to avoid even the smallest sign of violence happening on the island. So I urge you to read the memorandum. You'll be staying at the guest home of President Ndong. - They were adamant. - Wonderful. I have to be at the presidential palace at 5:30 for a meeting with the president's son. Very good. I will introduce you to your guide. No need, thanks, we've known each other a while. Well, if anything comes up, we'll let you know. Thank you very much. - How are you, Carlos? - Good. How are you? Great. I'm great. We've come a long way, haven't we, Carlos? Now you sit in the back, and you're wearing a Rolex… Yes, we've come a long way. - I mean, you're even more beautiful. - Oh, thank you. You still host parties on your boat? I can't remember the last party I threw, something like two years ago. - Did you party with Campbell? - With those people? No way. - Oh? What happened? - No, just not them. - They're just not like us. - How are they different? The oil company guys are not like the NGO guys. They don't care if they're here, in Alaska, Saudi Arabia… All they want is money and whores. - Any of the old crowd still living here? - No, the last one was Anthony. He hooked up with a Spanish girl, and he left. And did Ada and Calixto get married? No. She was waiting on you, Carlos. - Hello. Papers, please. - Here you are. - Go ahead. - Thank you. When did Calixto get into politics? I've been told he's involved with the Zandes. Oh, I don't know anything about that. He never talks to me about those things. What do you think? Look, I haven't been in touch with him since you left. So, I really have no idea. I don't know. I just couldn't wait until 5:30. - Pleasure, Your Excellency. - No, León. María, take care of the lady. Whatever she needs. The president wanted to welcome you, but he had to leave town on official business. I wanted to pay him my respects. This is the bedroom here. - Lady Gaga slept here once. - I saw that on YouTube. You can have a swim, you know. Make yourself at home. - Can we speak frankly? - Sure. Look, we all want to get this resolved with the engineer safely home and the president appearing at the UN as a leader of a democracy. - That's what we are, a democracy. - Yes. Of course. But if there's a massacre of the Zandes, you won't be credible. A society under the rule of law must never give in to these terrorists. Don't worry about it. I'll give in, not you. I do like you. I must leave now. - Tonight there's a party in your honor. - Yeah, so I'm told. My chauffeur will come fetch you. There's a toy in the garage. But don't forget, tonight, you leave it here. Someone will pick you up. Jesus, this is a fucking guest house? The injustice! - What's that? - Key to a Ferrari. What do you want to do now? - Make the most of it. Let's go. - Where? To Calixto's family's house. - That's Zande territory. - So? Do we look like we're Bana? No, but right now being white isn't much of an advantage either. - Come on. - No shower? - Come on. - In a suit and tie? Really? I'm taking it off. Where are you going? Going to Nguema. Nguema is not in a secure area. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Let them through. - Wait for me here. - All right. Hello? Anybody here? Hello? - Why are you here? - Hey, hey, easy, easy. I'm a friend. - Whose friend are you? - A friend of Ada, I swear to you. Hey, I'm a friend of Ada, and this is Calixto's house, no? - What do you want from her? - Eva, right? Eva, I'm Carlos, remember? I knew you when you were little. You know me. American. - Yes. - He was Ada's white boyfriend. Is Ada here? They took her. - Who took her? - The soldiers. To Black Beach. And Mama Claudina? Can I see her? I need to speak to her. There she is. You'll die on your feet, working. Any time disgrace strikes this family, you're in the middle of it. I need to speak to Calixto. Who asked you to stick your nose in all of this? I'm working for the oil company. Well, then, the Banas are your bosses. It wasn't me who got Calixto into this, but I'll get him out of it. Calixto never got mixed up into politics. The only mistake he ever made was trusting the whites. Look at the mess they got him into. You can trust me, Mama. I can help, as long as the American is still alive. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows. If Ndong finds him first, you know what'll happen? God help him. Think it over. There's not much time though. How did it go? Not great. Ada's in Black Beach. Let's go to dinner. I need a pass to get into Black Beach. Calixto's wife is there. I'll tell Stefan. He'll take care of it. - Great, thanks a lot, Douglas. - Whatever you need. Bye. I didn't know you had guests, ma'am. Who are you calling ma'am? This is Carlos, the friend I told you about. - How are you? - This is Lucía. Hi. Pleased to meet you. - Hello. - Hi. How'd she get those scars? Going where she doesn't belong. No, the ethnic markings on her face. You from Rebola? Do you know it? I've been there often, yeah. Did you buy that thing at the market? What are you insinuating? You don't believe I caught it? That thing's bigger than you are. Tell him. Tell him, damn it. - She's really cute. - She's pissed off. Was this painted this color? I repainted it six months ago. - How do you remember it? - Well, I only ever saw it at night. - The general said... - No, Stefan, listen. I don't care what the general says. I have to get into Black Beach no matter what, so call him back or call somebody else. - I'll do what I can. - Bye. Sorry. Do you have any news? - They still won't give me an answer. - They will sooner or later. I need to meet somebody in charge of MIA on the island. - I don't run in those circles. - But you know people. No, Carlos. - There must be someone. - There isn't, okay? - And those braces, she got them here? - No, she got them in Cameroon. Which is to say you go in and out regularly with this boat. Once a month? - I do have my friends, Carlos. - Friends, that's what I'm saying. - Yes, and I keep them. You wanna know how? - How? Staying out of trouble, minding my own business. - That's how a person survives. - How you survive? Yes, in the most sexist and homophobic place in the world. You already fucked me with this oil company where you got me working. Look at this straight. I didn't hire you to be my chauffeur. I needed your help with all of this. Sooner I get this behind us, the better for everyone. I go back to Brussels, you stay here with the boat. Exactly. You go back, and we stay here. Just leave us out of this shit. Mr. Fuster, welcome. His Excellency is expecting you. Carlos. Hey! Let me introduce you to the UN envoy, Roland. - Hello, Carlos. - Hello. I think we met once at your mother's in New York. A couple of years ago, sure. - Douglas. - What brings you here? Business. - Business? - Yeah, democracy and business get along. Yes, and they bring progress to all citizens, am I right? Right. Here's to progress. And to democracy and to stability. Cheers. - Cheers. - Come here. I want to show you the most beautiful girls in our country. - Vicky, Carlos. - Hello. - Pleasure. - Enchanté. - Sirene. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Carlos. And this… is Bebe. - Hello. - Hello. Ladies, take good care of him. The destiny of our nation is in his hands. No. What did you want to ask me? I need to ask for a favor. Whatever you need. I want to get into Black Beach. I need to speak with Batete's wife. I got nowhere with General Mba. General Mba is a very persuasive individual. If he hasn't gotten you anywhere, then I'm afraid… Let me try it my way then. Let me talk to the general. By tomorrow, you'll meet her. Thanks a lot. Some party he can throw here, huh? - Yeah. - I mean, look at him. - Have they made contact with you? - What? I asked if they have made contact with you. - I don't know what you mean. - Sure. They've contacted you? Yes, the MIA. - The MIA are terrorists, aren't they? - They were. They ended armed action a while ago. And so? They took great pains to assure us they were not behind this thing. That's good. If they're common criminals, should be easier to negotiate. Yeah. Apparently, the American had things when he disappeared, things that implicated the government, maybe the oil company as well. What things? Evidence. Evidence of what? We don't know exactly. But if it's true what they say… If what's true? The word of a terrorist faction? If this is true, Carlos, and Ndong and your people are involved, then it's better that you don't get mixed up in it. You could have someone else come down and take care of this job. Tell my mom there's nothing to worry about. Everything is fine. Hey, Bebe. - You got the wrong girl. - I just wanna talk to you. Well, I don't. Find someone else. The girls here can sometimes have a bit of an attitude. But I can introduce you to some more affectionate ones if you like. - I like the feisty ones, actually. - Well, you're the boss. My tests. I don't have HIV, and I intend to stay that way. What are you doing? I'm not gonna fuck you. - All right. - What the fuck? Are you an idiot? Then what do you want from me? - I wanna know what's up with Calixto. - I don't know about Calixto. - Bebe. - Leave me out of that shit. - You can't leave. - Oh, I can so. - Do you want me to call León? - Then just fuck me. Bebe, for Christ's sake! Bebe, please, just listen. Listen. I want to speak to you. All right? You won't get into any trouble, I swear you won't. Why are they saying Calixto kidnapped the American? - No idea. - You know. Tell me. - Why, Bebe? Why? - He'd never do what they're saying. - How do you know that? - Because Calixto worked with the American. They were close friends. He even wanted to take the kid to study in America. - What kid? - Ada's son. Who do you think? Ada has a son? Don't know about that? You know about nothing. Look at the smart-ass white guy. Calixto is a great man. He's better than you. He and Mama Claudina raised that boy like their own. You can't be serious. Are you joking? I took her to the hospital. You went with me. - You saw... - Were you actually in the room? Maybe Ada wasn't the gold digger you thought she was. She loved you. Carlos. Bad night? - Come on. - Where? Black Beach. - Welcome. - Thank you very much, General. This way. This is the only prison in all of Africa where we serve three meals a day. The envoy made his visit, and when he left, he was very impressed. The terrorist's wife is in isolation. You can go in. Open it. Shh. Get back. Ada. I'm sorry. Ada. Ada. Easy. It's me. It's Carlos. Ada. Easy. It's Carlos. It's me. Carlos? I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? - I'll be right back. - No. I know. Take it easy. Easy. I'll just be a minute. All right? She's dying in there. We have to get her to a hospital. She's a prisoner, accused of abetting terrorists. She can't leave here until she's tried. Do something, or she'll be dead before that. Don't worry about it. These animals are tougher than you know. - The envoy saw all this? - We didn't show him this section. I told His Excellency, I need to speak to this woman. And I can't in her condition. - I'll order her transfer to the infirmary. - You'll do what I say. What did you say? His Excellency won't appreciate you keeping me from doing my job. Call the president, please. Get out. Call him now. Oh, shit, Carlos. I'm still trembling. Did you know Ada has a son? Of course I did. You didn't know about that? No. - Do you know where he is? - No. Could you find out? Well, I can ask around, but I can't promise anything. Okay, thanks. I'm gonna stay here and make sure she gets transferred to the hospital. - Whatever happens, I'll call you. - Fine. Hey, thanks. Carlos. Thank you. I can get them both out of the country. - I don't know where he is. - The child as well. Don't you touch that child. Lay a finger on him, and I'll tear your eyes out of your head in one go. He's their son. - He's Ada and Calixto's. - Know what'll happen if you don't help me? Calixto will never see that child or Ada or anyone else for that matter. You didn't hear what I told you. I don't know where the child is. Yeah. - Still alive? - Apparently. - What's happening? - This is more complicated than we thought. - What's going on, Carlos? - I don't think it's a kidnapping. The engineer might have material that would compromise the government and the oil company. - Is that a theory or a fact? - For the moment, it's still a theory. Any idea what it could be? I don't know, and I don't want to know. Yeah, the United Nations guy does. Gotta go, bye. Well? Relax, he's safe. He is in an orphanage in Basako. - Did you see him? - No. Want me to take you there? Carlos, it's no big deal. Africa is filled with mixed kids who never saw their fathers. My wife is pregnant, Ale. - I got a daughter on the way. - Carlos. Ada just woke up. She asked to speak to you. Can you get me out of here? Please don't let me die here. Don't talk nonsense. You're gonna be all right. So you're still a big liar. You lied to me as well. You were never supposed to find out. I don't know how to apologize. He needs his father. Help them, Carlos. I swear I'll do all I can. But you're gonna need to help me. Where is he? Where is Calixto? - I need to go somewhere near Rebola. - Impossible, Carlos. They have checkpoints all over town. - Maybe if you speak to Mba... - The general mustn't find out. - I know how to get there. - How is that? We can slip through in a canoe down by the swamp. Are you for real, Carlos? I never go there, not even during the day. Your girlfriend must know it well. Hey, man, you just forget about Lucía. She doesn't exist. I need to get to Pelé. Nothing'll happen, seriously. I said no, it's no! Ale, please, just listen. I can work this all out. Nobody gets hurt, and nobody gets killed. I just need to speak to Calixto. Your girlfriend can help me. I said no. It's my only option. And I want to help Calixto, or else I wouldn't be asking. - We'll have to walk from here. - Yeah, I know where to go. I'll be fine. - Wait for me here. - Don't fuck around, Carlos. We didn't come all the way out here to be left waiting alone. I got something to discuss with Calixto. I better go on my own. I'll be back in a couple of hours at most. Two hours. All right? - Calixto. - Fuck you doing here? Calm down. Don't worry. Nobody knows you're here. It's all right. Come on. How did you find me? From Ada. How is she? She's not well. - She asked me to help you and the kid. - Calixto's all right? Yeah. Yeah. They hid him in a secure location. I didn't know his name was Calixto. Ada was adamant. I was hoping for a Claudina, but it was a boy. My wife's gonna have a little girl. Congratulations. I behaved badly with Ada and with you. - You were right. I was a bastard. - Yeah, you were a bastard. Look, I only came here to get you out of this. Hmm. - I really want to help, okay? - All right. Where's Campbell? Where is he? - Go ask your guys. - Calixto, I gotta speak to him. They murdered him. - Murdered him? Who did? - You guys. And you will murder me too. No one's gonna hurt you. No one's gonna kill you. That's nonsense. - Why was he killed? - Reason why you're here. I came to help you get back together with Ada. You came for Campbell's documents. Hmm? Tell me what happened. Steve played you. He found the dirt. He had it all, and he could prove it, Carlos. He thought it would help the Zande people to take the files to the United Nations. What was in those documents? He wouldn't tell me for my own protection. I'm protected now, right? Hmm? The worst kind of racists aren't the ones who hate us. The worst are the ones who want to come save us. Come on, Calixto. This has nothing to do with racism. This is money talking. Which is why we can make this go away. - Oh, me and you? Us? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Where are the documents? God. If you know where the documents are, I can get you out of here with your family. - Get us out? - You can leave. - You wanna get me out of my country? - You gotta trust me. You're not trustworthy, Carlos. Your promises mean nothing. You work for Ndong. All Ndong wants is the oil. So please just do what I say. Ah. What the fuck do you care about those documents? Are you suggesting I don't care about my people? I almost believed you. I swear I don't know how they found us. Calixto! No, no, no, no! No, put the gun down. Please put the gun down, Calixto! Calixto Batete. - I'm begging you. No! - Come out with your hands up. What? I didn't do anything! You are surrounded. Drop your gun and step outside. - Calixto, please... - These people came to kill me. - No, no one... - Carlos, those are your people! - I have no idea how they got here! - You brought them here! - Here, here! - No, put that down. Take my gun! Do it yourself! Take my gun, here. Kill me yourself! - Calixto Batete, you are surrounded. - What? I have no fucking idea how they found us. They'll never let me out of here alive. - No one is gonna kill you. - They'll never let me out of here alive. - Give me the gun, man. - Carlos, they killed Campbell. They killed Campbell. What do you think they'll do to me? No one's gonna kill you, okay? You're with me now. Now we're gonna walk outside, hands over our heads so can they see we're unarmed. You stay behind me. We're gonna be fine, I swear to you. Trust me. I'm your friend. I'm here to help you. Please. Let me handle it. Let me handle it. It's all right. He's unarmed. We're coming out now. We are coming out with our hands up. No guns. We have no weapons. Easy. Look. He's unarmed. Calixto, come here. Calixto, come out. Behind me, come on. Easy. Come out. Come on! Hands up so they can see you're unarmed. Hands over your head. There. There. Lower those weapons, please. Easy. Easy. Good. You're okay. No! You're safe now. Search the place. Take him. Follow the light. There you go. - Is that your blood? - Huh? - On your neck. Is that blood yours? - No. No. Are you in pain? Are you hurt? - No. - Fine. You should have told us you were going. Put yourself in danger unnecessarily. It's a good thing your driver let us know. They found Campbell's body on the same spot. He had been dead for days. - Excuse me, could you wait outside? - That's why they never tried to negotiate. Those bastards! He was surrendering. - What? - Calixto was giving himself up. They found his weapon. And it happens to be the same weapon used to kill Campbell. And the documents? Documents? The documents the engineer had. Did they find them? Excuse me, would you step outside, please? Thank you. You're neck deep in this horse shit. - How are you? - How the fuck do you think I am? This whole thing was a charade. A charade to cover the oil company and Ndong's bullshit. - Do you have the documents? - No. Neither does Ndong. - You know where they are? - We'll see. What does that mean? - Do you know or don't you? - No. Tell me the truth. It's important. It's like I told you, I don't know. Okay, come home right now. Fuck those guys. I'll talk to Donovan, and he can figure this shit out himself. Hmm. I've come to thank you for all you've done for our republic. I'm sorry about the engineer you lost. They are murderers. But when the report is complete and they've lifted the embargo, I can assure they'll pay for what they have done. Hmm. Uh, the wife of the kidnapper. Died last night. I sent some flowers in your name. It was the least I could do. See you soon in New York. Thanks again. - Hi there. - Hello, darling. - How are you? - Good. And you? I'll be coming home tomorrow morning. - Already? - Yeah. I barely had time to miss you. Did you work the problem out? No. - Want to tell me about it? - Not right now. How was your day? Pretty decent. During the six hours your daughter played football, she scored three field goals… Three field goals? That's pretty good. Well, actually two field goals and one extra point. I scheduled a Lamaze class now, but we can keep talking. No, no, no, I… I just… I just wanted to tell you I'll be there in the morning. I'll let you go, all right? - I love you so much, honey. - I love you. Eight. - Nine. - Nine. Ten. Ten. - One. - One. - Two. - Two. - Three. - Three. - Four. - Four. - Five. - Five. - Six. - Six. - Seven. - Seven. Shh. Calm down, silence. - Nine. - Nine. - Ten. - Ten. - May I help you? - Yes, hello. - I was looking for Calixto. - Oliver, sit back down. Calixto Batete, he's about nine. I'm a friend of his parents. I know who you are. He is no longer here. Shh… - Well, where is he? - A white woman came for him. Who? A woman with bad habits who lives on a boat. Right, thanks. Hey, sit down. Ale! - Carlos. What is it? - Come here. I need to talk to you. - What is it? - "What is it," my ass! Where's the boy? - Don't give me that shit. - What happened? Where the hell is Calixto? You took him! - Where the hell is he? - What are you saying, Carlos? - Calm down! The boy is okay. - Where the hell did you take him? - Take it easy! The boy is at my place. - He's at Lucía's! He's with my family, Carlos. He's fine. - They came looking for him. - Idiot! Wait, why with your family? He is in a safe place. Carlos, God. On top of the mess you got us mixed up in, you come here and break our balls too! Five hours you left us waiting out there! Five hours wondering what happened to you! What were we supposed to do or think? And then those people kept calling us! Then she took the boy to safety, risking it all for your ass! She's risking her life, and so am I! And you pull this shit on us. I'm sorry. They kept hammering us with questions. They kept going over what we did in Nguema. What did they wanna know? Well, all of it. Where we'd been, with whom, what we did… - What did you say? - The truth, Carlos. Everything but the kid. Want some coffee? - You found what the American had? - Lucía, quiet, please. What do you know about that? - It's important for the Zandes. - I'm not going to tell you again, quiet. I don't have those documents. - Carlos. - You're risking your neck, for God's sake. Please cut it out! Forget about those documents. Get out of there soon as you can. Mom, that's why I called. If we get them to the envoy, it's not my problem anymore. Carlos, tell me where to find them, and we'll take care of it. I think I know where they are, but I have to go myself. Honey, that's not a good idea. Mom, I'm not letting this go. So help me out, please. I'll speak with our man. He's at Hotel Eureka. I'll tell him to wait for you there. You stay with him. We'll get you both out. I won't go alone. - Mom, I gotta go now. I'll let you know. - Carlos? Yeah, I'll call you back. Love you. Bye. - Carlos, this is on you, damn it. - Tell me what to do. Lucía, please. Come on. I can get those documents, or at least I think I know how. I need you to fetch the boy right now. You and him wait for me at the Hotel Eureka. - Okay? - All right. - Yeah, sure, send her to Black Beach. - That's enough. - Relax, seriously. Ale, please! - No, I won't. You think I'd put her in a position where something bad could happen to her? Let me just say one thing. I'll go to the hotel. - You go to your sister's. - No. - Don't argue with me. Christ! That's all. - Okay. I'm warning you, Carlos, this is the last time we help you out. - I won't do it anymore. I'm sick of you! - Ale. Ale, my ass. - Ale. - Leave me alone. I'll wait an hour at the bar. If I don't see you, I'll take the boy and go. Fine. I want them to pay for this. Did they find the documents? Eva, did they get what they came for? If they didn't, then maybe I can make this right. Are you listening? You will give it to the Banas? Don't stay here. Get to Rebola. I'm so sorry. Mama never thought you were a bad person. She just thought you brought back luck. Get the white man. - Get the white man, come on. - Go, go. Come on, quick now! - What's happening? - Hide. - Up there, go! - Let's go! Through there! That way! Come on, move! Go, go, go! Go, go! Catch him! Give me a hand, here. - Open this door! Move it - Let's go! - Come on! - Break down the door! Up there! He's up there! - Let's go! Up on the roof! Move it! - Let's go! Go around the other side! Let's go! - Where is he? - General! Hey! General! There! I want him alive. Quick! Step aside, coming through. There! There! Fucking shit. Step aside. Let's go! Let's go, outside! Get out, get out, get out! - Cover the side streets! The side streets! - There's a unit that way. Carlos! - Carlos! Over here! - Come on! Let's go! Let's go! At the bridge! There he is! Catch him! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Go, go! Stop! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! This way! Run! Go, go, go, go! Come on! Oh, shit, fuck! Left, over there. Faster! Faster! We can't let them get to Nguema! Fucking bastards. Fuckers. - Faster, go! - Carlos! Go! Look out! - Watch out! - Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Fuck! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Everybody out. - Are you all right? - Yeah! This is Zande land. You're not allowed here! Take it easy. - All we want is the white guy. - Go away! Take it easy. - We'll take the white guy, and we'll go. - Get out of here! I can't open the fucking door! Put the machete down! Get out of here! Put it down! Get the hell away! Stop right there. Stop! - Oh, my fucking God! - Let's go! Ale. Ale. You. Give them to me. Give them to me. Can't you hear me? I want those fucking documents now. Right now! You want me to shoot? Lucia! Lucía! Ale! Ale! Ale! Ale, please. We have to clean your wounds. Sit down. All right, children, turn it off. This man has to speak to Calixto. - This is the last one. Please. - Come on. Enough. - Hey. - All right, stand up now. Hello, Calixto. You know who I am? I promised your mother I would take care of you. One message available. Fuck, Carlos. Why won't you answer the goddamn phone? I'm on a plane, on my way down there. We'll work this out when I get there. Carlos. I found some clean clothes for you to wear. Thanks. The boy is asleep now. Want something to eat? No, but thank you. They really are that important? Ndong is fucked if I can get these documents out of the country. But there's only one way I can make it. I'm gonna need your help. - Are you there yet? - Yes. Carlos, where are you? I've been trying to reach you. Carlos? Carlos, can you hear me? I'm on my way. Stop the car. - Come on out. - Wait. Don't get out yet. - Let's go. - Come here. All right. - Where are those fucking documents? - Hey, hey. - Check the car. - What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! - Leave him alone. - Fucking joker! Stop this. Hey, stop it! - Don't touch the kid! Get your hands off! - Leave the kid. Leave the kid alone. - Come here. - Calixto. - Watch it. - It's okay. I got you. It's all right. Yeah. Take it easy, okay. Hey, Calixto. - Calixto! - Don't move, asshole! It's okay, Carlos. Let's go. Thanks a lot, Douglas. Take care, Stefan. Some mess you made here. Wait for me. I'll be right back. I'm sorry. We believed that the kidnapping was real. These sons of bitches never told us about the documents. But don't worry. Let Donovan see about those guys. You got them? The president's and Donovan's signatures are all over those documents. Why would you let them sign? The president insisted, stupid degenerate. - Fucking Africans. - Will Donovan take care of him too? Oh, fuck, Carlos, give it a break! Sometimes you have to do certain things, you know it! But there's a limit. Don't be fucking naive. These people are dangerous, so just give them the fucking documents. - We're talking about a lot of money here. - How much? - How much? - What's a fair price? You had me worried there for a minute. I was beginning to think you lost your marbles, Carlos. I'm sure there's a number of countries that would pay a lot of money. Who could pay us the most? That'd be Stoneoil. As a bonus, I'd be very happy to make sure that you're transferred to New York. Shouldn't make it seem like blackmail, am I right? What's the number? I don't know. Ten million, 15. Why would you rent in New York? Better to buy. Fifty million. I leave today, and the boy comes with me. I'll speak to them. I don't think there will be a problem there. - I'll need to have the documents. - I don't have them on me now. - Then how can we ask for 50 million? - I'm not negotiating. The documents are in a safe place. You get them when I'm in Brussels. Period. Take care of yourself and rest up. Remember, they want the originals. The sooner they have them, the less nervous they become. I don't have any video games, but you can watch cartoons if you like. You can change channels with this button here. Need anything else? So, how old is he? I think he's nine. You think? Nine, for sure. Shit. I don't know what to say. All of it. I want the whole story. - I've been followed. - Yes, I know. It's arriving in three days, through Cameroon. - Lucía? - Don't worry. She's safe. - Hello. - Mom, it's me. - Don't worry, this is a secure line. - Carlos, what's going on? I'll have the originals in three days. Do you know the risk of giving them to me? I've made up my mind, Mom. As soon as I get them, I'm going to New York. No, I'll go. I'll go. It's safer that way. Holy shit. Mr. Fuster, you can't go through. Mr. Fuster, wait. Wait there, please. - Carlos. - Why don't you answer my fucking calls? They broke into my house and ransacked it. 'Cause you're making them nervous. - Are you threatening me? - Is Susan all right? Stress should be avoided in her condition. If something happens to my family, I swear to God, I'll kill you. Susan. Susan, this is Sigalot. - Pleased to meet you, ma'am. - Hi, nice to meet you. You have a very nice house. - Thank you. - This is Rafa. He and I will stay here, and we will escort you if you need to go out. - So, if you have any questions, just ask. - Great, thank you. So, this is gonna be our life now? - Excuse me. - Honey. Susan. Susan, please. Honey, let's talk about this. Honey. - You might have been killed. - I'm fine, Mom. Don't worry. - When does the report go public? - In a couple of days. The timing's good. Donovan and Ndong's names are all over those documents. You've got them. No, I don't think it's a good idea to do this. Your future is on the line and that of your family. From what you told me, we could open an investigation. Mom, an investigation means years of work. It's all right there in those documents. Carlos. This is your mother you're speaking to. When this goes public... I'm not speaking to you as my mother but as a representative of the UN. But I am first and foremost your mother. And I don't think you should do this. Don't rush things. You shouldn't make a decision, such an important decision, this quickly. This won't be the end of the matter. There'll be opportunities for a new committee and... Mom. Mother. You'll see a man at the airport wearing a red tracksuit. He'll give them to you. How are you? It'll be all right, I promise you. We have enough money to get by for now. I could look for another job. What job could you get? Who would hire you? Anyway, the job is not what matters. That's not what worried about. I just can't do nothing. I won't. - She's very busy. - Two days she hasn't called back. I'm not surprised. She has a lot on her plate. - Is that her? - Graham. Something wrong? This report on the... Distinguished heads of state and government. Mr. Secretary General of the United Nations. Ladies and gentlemen. My country is proud of the support shown to us today by the United Nations. But our struggle for a stable and strong democracy has opponents. And that is why we need your support to fight the terrorists that want to return to a past full of blood and pain not only in our country but around the world. The years of international embargo… Janet? It's Carlos. Tell my mother to get back to me immediately. I know where she is, damn it! Pull her out of there and have her call me. Just tell her. Shit. I can't fucking believe it. …he won the first free to go elections, supported by 93% of the votes. Those days when he became president after the 1983 coup d'état remain firmly in the past. Those times... North of the islands, not much. Some groundswell, indeed. The temperatures between 25 and 30 to 31 degrees Celsius. Carlos. It's good to see you. Hello there. Oh, my God, she's so tiny. She's very pretty. So, what's her name? She's named after you. It's what Susan wanted. Hmm. Elena. Such a sweet little thing. - You managing with the two of them? - Fine. Really. - Susan's doing well at work. - Mm-hmm. I'm at home with the kids till I can find a new job. If you like, I can make a few calls… No. - Whatever you need. - Thanks a lot. Mom, tell me what happened. I need to know, Mom. Please. Please, Mom. Some complicated times we're living through with the Chinese buying all of Africa. There were strategic considerations, enormous stakes. It wasn't easy. And for your protection, as well, it's for the best, son. Those men were bound to hurt you. Did Graham do the negotiation? What does that matter? It's important. Donovan. It was supposed to be Graham. But then it was Donovan. Secretary of State Donovan. If that had gone public, it would have hurt more than Ndong and the oil company. What you did was not in vain. Ndong will concede power to his son. And he will immediately hold elections. He's agreed to it. It will be a fair election, I promise you. There's something else, no? The United States will fund a development program called "Africa Is One." Your program. Five hundred million beneficiaries in 24 countries. All that exposure positions you well. I want things to get better, but they won't get better with a magic wand. You understand that. So do I. If you weren't so personally involved, you'd see that. Perhaps. You give my love to Susan and the boy. I'd be glad if we could get together with them soon. I really miss you. Have a safe trip. - Yes. - We got it. We just spoke, and it goes out tomorrow. The Washington Post and The Guardian are in. They'll publish also. Thank you, Carlos. Done? Juliette. Coo-coo-coo. Coo-coo, Juliette. Calixto's in the tub. See if he's all right. He keeps splashing water all over the place. Tell him it's not a swimming pool.
