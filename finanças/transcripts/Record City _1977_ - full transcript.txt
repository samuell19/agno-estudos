He is a cw group with a bunch of dudes known as the the Texasewboys. Their main hit and first album was known as I'must a lasso from El Paso. Hey wiz. - And here's Rupert. Look what I found, isn't this exciting? Hey man, what's so exciting about a tape recorder? Listen, Rupert, have you been playing yankee doodle with your dandy? I don't do that anymore. Hey, Rupert, what's so special about this tape machine? It's Eddie's theme. Every time he's making it with the chicks, he plays it. Here, listen. Hey man, that's some funky music where did you find that? Behind the loading dock. I wonder who he made it with. At the restaurant, she really digs him. She always slips him extra meat in his sukiyaki. Yeah, I'll bet he slipped her a piece of meat too. Give me that, I got an idea, you guys. Hey, wait a minute. Cool it. Hey, now that's a real hot item. That's moving right up on the charts and uh. Hey listen, that's my balling music! Some bastard's playing my theme. Oh it is? I thought it was another old cassette player. Except for that funky music on the inside. And these dune stars pasted on the outside. Now I wonder what they mean. I know what they mean. Every time Eddie scores, he pastes another one on the case. Chill out, Rupert, now give me the cassette! Eddie, hey hey hey, oh. Oh you guys, you guys are the lowest. From now, you keep your damn hands off my personal property. - Eddie! You said you never played that unless. Hey, shut up, moshi. It was a mistake, really, I'm not making it with anybody else, it wasust a mistake. Tell her it was a mistake. Really you know I'm faithful to you. Would I lie to a working woman? Edward. I'll get you for this. Boy, sure wish I was more like Eddie. Say what? - I said I sure wish. - I heard what you said Iust don't believe that you said it. Well what I mean is, well Eddie's so good with the chicks. Yeah, but he's got no class. Yeah, but did you see all the stars on that cassette machine? Think, I've never even scored once. Oh, Rupert my friend. Let's see if we cannot help you with your problem. Now we gotta find a woman for you that knows where it's at, you know what I mean? I mean a woman like Rita. Ah, Rita, she not only knows where it's at, she knows where it used to be. Eh, I want you to go over there and shoot your best shot. Hey, I'm nothing like Eddie. Eddie's a dynamite talker. Rupert, you are a college man. I mean you got a lotta interesting things to rap about. Eh, now what did you study? Tax accounting. See, everybody wants to know about that taxive. Now listen, you go on over there and you hit her with some of that, you know? Then kinda ease the conversation on around to sex. Hey, and then you are in, im. I'm in, huh? - Yeah. 1'l do it. Start out with taxes, ease around to sex? What do you want? Did you know that define benefits may be used as a pension deduction for corporations under the new tax law? So what? - So you wanna make it with me? I don't think so. It wouldn't be so good for your health. Oh thank you. It's no go. She's got some kinda health problem. Hey man, who's the dude with the pipe? I don't know, what do you think he's smoking in it? Hey, what you got there, macho? Record. - Oh ee, honey, you can ring your barrette all the time.

If I don't get this off my chest I swear I will explode like a rotten cantaloupe. What is wrong, Rex, I've never seen you so mad before. - It is that swine, Eddie Pierce. If I wasn't a pacifist, I'd love to scratch his eyes out. Do you know, he had the audacity to humiliate me out front. I mean, it was shameful. Oh gee, Rex, that's terrible. Eddie isn't very sensitive about people, I guess. Eddie, sensitive? Ha, I've seen paid toilets with more humanity. But he won't get away with this, I swear he won't. He'll be sorry he trifled with Rex Hayworth. Oh, man, that was so far out. The gorilla man's got the shout.
