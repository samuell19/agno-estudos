Mr. Güven... Çiçek? I'm fine, sweetheart. How are you? Really? That's great. What? But just last week... Ok, ok. We'll talk about it tonight. What's your mother up to? Fine... See you tonight sweetheart. Now we have to deal with painting classes. More expenses. It's not easy having a talented kid. We'll get by somehow. Ok. What's up? I was gonna have these signed. Let's see. And, I was going to remind you... The advance... What? The advance. Alright, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it, but you still haven't covered the previous ones! Hello? Yes, Mr. Yavuz. We're all waiting for this new law to pass. Then everything should fall into place. Let's hope so. Alright. See you later. Good bye. Come on! Be careful with that! Sorry Mr. Hamdi! No problem. Come here. This way. Come here. Easy. What's happening Mr. Seyfi? I already told you that Ms. Arzu is starting tomorrow. You did, but you didn't mention she'd be settled here... You know the situation here. Where else can I put her? In my mouth? No, of course not. Anyway... At least there'll be somebody to talk to. It looks ok. It's a big room anyway. Look at that! They scratched it! Assholes! You scratched the table! You've already met Fatma. Kemal. And this is Mrs. Gülşen. If she's not in the mood even the water will taste bitter, so be warned. Yes. Welcome to the firm. Thank you. Here you are. We'll bring the rest tomorrow, the phone and all that. - Let me take it. - Thank You. If you really need to, just use Güven's phone. Sure. Welcome again. How do you do? Fine. And You? No complaints. Home to work, work to home. Family. The usual... What about you? Me? Married? Kids? Oh... Yes. I've a daughter, 5 years old. Lovely. Mine is 5 too. Her name's Çiçek. She just started school. At 5? She's really clever. She takes after her mom. Nice. In the rush I forgot. Let's have dinner tonight. A welcome dinner. Alright. Ok with you, Güven? Excuse me? What "Excuse me?" I said dinner. Of course that would be great, but... What a romance you have with your wife. New Years Eve, no. Birthday party, no.. - Bring your wife with you, no. - But... No "buts" about it.... Ms. Arzu, your husband is welcome as well. We'll see. Thank you very much. I guess you're not really into it. It's not that, my daughter is a bit too attached... At least in the evenings I should be home... Yes?... Yes my girl... I have to work... Of course I'll bring it... Alright, love... Strawberry flavored. Is your mom ok?. Alright sweetheart. See you soon. She calls everyday. As soon as she gets home. 4 on the dot. Like I said, she is attached to me. Yes? I was gonna remind you about the... I said I'd take care of it, didn't I? Get rid of the hair and the beard. When? How much? Alright. Alright. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing at all. Welcome Mr. Seyfi. Thanks Kemal. Ms. Arzu began today and I thought we'd celebrate. What should I bring you? You decide, whatever you choose. Very good. What would you like to drink? What are you having? Mr. Seyfi will be drinking raki. Then I'll have a glass of red wine. And you, sir? I'll have some water. Here it is. Come on, drink something! It doesn't agree with me Mr. Seyfi. That's why. What the hell. I'll have a glass of wine too. Aren't you leaving? Haydar? What?... No. I'll leave in a little while. Let me finish this. In those days there were no computers of course. The papers all piled up. I couldn't seem to find their license. What is this piddling around? You're chatting like a teenager. No Mr. Seyfi. Not chatting. Ah, is there some other reason why you are missing all these dinners? Of course not. I mean if Ayla were to hear... Come on, how would she? Hasn't it been 4-5 years? And we still haven't even seen your wife. I am not even sure if she exists or not. Please excuse me. I have to call home. But of course. Hello? Betül? I'm sorry. I'm still busy. Has Selin eaten? What? Come on Betül. Let me talk to her. Hello? I am coming. You can stay by yourself for an hour, right? That's my girl. Alright. I have to go now. Sorry about that. Not at all. My husband also had a business dinner tonight. If you have to go. No, no. I took care of it. Look, her husband is also at a business dinner. I can't seem to get through to you... These dinners bring people together, motivate. Of course it's like that. Don't misunderstand. I tease him all the time but I like him a lot. He never comes late, he never does a sloppy job. He is a bit a-social, that's all. Alright friends! Are we at a funeral or what! Excuse me. Hello? Yes, Ayla? We're about to leave. How's it going. Thanks. It's too much trouble. Why? We're going the same way. Unless you don't like my driving. Of course not. You're a great driver. You don't drive? No. Not in this traffic. Plus all that expense. Where to? Where to? Where in Bakırköy? Ah... I'll get out right at the square. It's two minutes from there. I'll take you, if you want. No, no. You're already late. Thank You. Ok... Thank you very much. Congratulations once again. Good night. It's the belt. Good night. You fucked up my life! I'll show you what's what with a telephone! At your age! Come back here! You give her these ideas! The bane of my existence! Where are you going! Come!. Where the hell are you going? What're you doing here? I was waiting for you. Tamer. Why are you here? I missed my daughter. I thought I'd stop by and say hello. Ah... She's alone! Her mother's out. She was not alone. Betül was with her. She wasn't when I came. She had to leave early. I was at a business dinner. Anyway, I'm here. You can go now. What dinner was that? A welcome dinner for my new job. Some people have to work. Not you. You don't have to work! Quiet. You'll wake her up. Please come back. Tamer. Yes? You smell horrible. Yes? The rent. What do you mean? The apartment rent. I always give it to Aunt Saniye. I'll be taking it this month. I told her, don't worry. This'll be the last rent anyway. What do you mean 'the last'? We're turning the building over to a developer. So, this is the last rent. How're you all? Aaah! Welcome chief. Hi Kemal. ♪ And the accident occurring on the Kadikoy D 100 highway... ♪ ...has been a veritable massacre... ...The guy asks for my ID. I flip out, I slug him and he hits the dirt. I stuck the barrel to his temple and said 'Here is my ID!' The fag is squirming under me: 'You don't know who I am!' Chief! Come on, give me a minute! I'm telling a story here! Anyway, I stuffed him into the car... Vedat. Either put it out or go outside. I'll just pay the fine, ok. If you got cash, pay your debt first. So now it's like that, huh? Tell Güven to come in. Come in, Haydar. What's this? Here. Today I'll talk about your thing. It doesn't matter. I took care of it. Mr Seyfi wants you. Come in! You asked for me. Come in Guven, sit down. To cut to the chase, if we make them happy... ...they'll give us the accountancy contracts of their four auxiliary firms. Of course. We'll take care of it. I... Of course they want a quote for that. Take a look and we'll talk later. You've reached Turk Telekom wake up and reminder service. Thank you for calling. How sweet, both of them. Selin is going to school this year too. Which one does Çiçek go to? It was Çiçek, wasn't it? We worked hard for the nation. But that's how it goes... I put myself on the line but this European Union thing... Anyway, it's a long story. Those who don't know how to appreciate will also disappear someday. Mother! Open the door! Hey mom! This is Mr. Sedat. Who? Mr. Sedat! The developer. How are you grandma? Bugger off! She didn't understand. I'll talk her into it. She is a little hard of hearing. Don't worry, we'll handle it. Aren't you leaving Ms. Arzu? I've a little more work to do. Have a good evening. Alright, good night then. Good night. Hello? Hello mom. I'll leave in a bit. Yeah, well. I've a lot of work. Ok, alright. Good night. You too. Let's say you can't hear, are you also blind! We live in squalor in this shitty house! Do we have to wait till it collapses on our heads? So my father built this house. If he were alive, he'd accept the offer. I spent all those years serving the nation and what do I get! Fired! Did anybody ask if I'm ok, do I need anything? I gave everything to the nation. Did I kill the fucking guy! He didn't talk, the bastard! Who're you protecting? What're you hiding? Who're you! I did what was right. I did what I was told! Where is she? She is doing her homework. Aliye! Aliyeeee! Every one of you, you've sucked me dry! Mommy, can we get this too? Strawberry flavor. Ok dear. Betül, this is just for a few days. I'll leave in a bit. Ok, half an hour more. OK. Bye. You're also working late. Yes. It's busy these days. I was going to ask you, where are the personnel files? Over there. It has a priority sticker on it. Ok. Thanks. Hello? ...then we went to the park with Betül but the swings were wet. We didn't ride. Then some policemen came. There're also some women. Betül said that they're mothers. Probably police mothers. Then the mothers yelled at the police. Maybe they're naughty. Right mother? Uh - huh. Mother? Yes dear? I miss my dad a little. Welcome. Let me pay the... Thanks luv. Ah... Would you care for a drink? What the hell am I doing? Comin baby! Comin sweetheart! Welcome Mr. Güven. Good morning. Just a second. This came for you. I can't find your file Mr. Güven. Could it be with you? No. What do you want with my file? The guys from the Chamber asked for. Ah, I've found it! Morning. What's wrong with those cleaners. Mr. Güven. Yes? While I was getting the stapler from your desk... Yes? It was an accident, sorry. It's ok. A friend of mine from a casting agency arranged that shoot. Anyway, it was the first and last. You know, all those hours in that heat for two pictures. Both Ayla and my daughter were miserable. So we have this as a memory. Nice one though, huh? The photographer was a real artist. Look Ms. Arzu. You're good. You're smart. It's obvious. But this is no place for your detective work. Look, I'm happily married, have a daughter I adore. Appreciate what you've got, stay out of other people's business. - But... - Ms. Arzu! Mind your own business, I'll do the same. Alright? Aliye! It's already noon! Get up or I'll give you a good beating. Yes? Yes Mr. Seyfi? Ok. Let me finish... Alright, I'm coming. Yes Mr. Seyfi? Sit down. What is it? Sit down! Hello, Nezaket? Is Aliye with you? Alright. No, it's ok. Mother! Aliye! Hello? Is Aliye there? Come on, open the door! She's not here... OK, anyway. Aliyeee! Mother? Spit it out. What? Tell me about the missing twenty thousand. You know these computers. Probably the program made a mistake. And you even double-checked. You signed. Haydar! Don't take me for a fool! If there is a problem with the paperwork, I can fix it. How can there be a withdrawal from the account, tell me that! I know everything. What? What do you know? Everything. What do you know Haydar, tell me. I just know! I'm sorry, brother, but if we sink, we sink together. Ok, so... Can you eat 14 hamburgers? If I'm really hungry. Ok. Could you saw boards and make a table? Propably not. Müge's father can. Is he a carpenter? How did you know? I guessed. Who is Müge? She is in our class. The one taller than me. Betül, what do you mean Selin hasn't come? How come she didn't get off the bus? Do you know Müge wet her pants today? You know, we were drawing. I looked down, the cushion was soaked in piss. She kept saying she didn't do it. Dad. Yes dear? You know sometimes I wouldn't go to bed when you told me to.... Yes? Also I don't like celery root. If I went to bed early and ate celery root, would you make up with Mom? What? With you? How could you do that without telling me? When did you call? OK, anyway. Betül's at home, waiting. Bye. Something happened. - Something happened to my mother! - What happened? We don't know. I am very sorry. I shouldn't have been snooping. Is something wrong? Mr. Güven? It's ok. A little mixup with the accounts. Hang on mother. Get out of the way! My mother is dying! What are these? VAT files. Why are they here? Why aren't they finished? There are still 3 days. Have them ready by tomorrow. - Mr. Seyfi... - Haydar! Have them done by tomorrow! And get a haircut, you look like a horse thief! Yes. Yes my girl? I'm fine. No, everything's ok. Ok, my sweetheart. I'll get it. Bye. I'm leaving. I'm done too. Shall I drop you off? No, its alright.

Good night. You too. Vedat. Give me the phone. I'll try calling my sister-in-law again. Mom, I talked to the developer and told him it wouldn't work. That building was from our father and we would never tear it down. Why did I make such a fuss? Cause you can't hear. Otherwise I'd never have upset you. Aliye wanted a phone the other day. That upset me, so I got in touch with the developer. I can't make ends meet mother. I just can't. The guilt is killing me. I can't get rid of that kid's face. It won't go away. Please don't you go away Mother! Nobody's home. Nor my grandma. Her door smashed in. There're needles on the floor. They told me the ambulance came and took her. I ran away from home yesterday. We were going to go to Izmir. But Cemile changed her mind. I missed my mother. I was so scared. I really don't want a cellphone. Nowhere. She's nowhere. Saniye Baştürk? Wait a second. Room 206. Over there. Banu. Banu. Come on, let me take you home. I checked. It was my mistake Mr. Seyfi. The last few days have been... My mistake... I'll make up for it as soon as possible, don't worry. Güven. Whatever the problem is... whatever I can do, let me know. We've tried but it doesn't work. You've promised you'd quit several times. I have to go. Tamer! Ok. Six thirty. I have to go! I'm leaving. If my family calls.... Get well soon Aunt Saniye. Thanks. I hope she gets well soon. Thank You. It's been taken care of. Did they say anything? No, we're waiting. Look, I don't know how I will repay you. You will... Little by little.. Of course the money can be paid back. And I'm sorry about the thing with Ms. Arzu. What about Ms. Arzu? I heard you that day talking, at the door. But I forgot about it. That's what you meant when you said you know everything. It's none of my business. But when you were put under such pressure... It's fine. It went well. Thank God. Again, best wishes to all of you. If you need anything, just call. Mr. Güven. God bless you. Hello, this is Arzu. Yes Mr. Seyfi? No. Something came up, he left. Alright. Where is the rent, my boy? I was just bringing it. How you doing Aunt Saniye? Fine, fine. Here... Mr. Vedat said that this would be the last. He's made a deal with the developer. Who? I said Vedat! He made a deal! I sent him away! My husband made this house! How you're doing, Mom? What's that? The rent. Have a good day. I've quit. So you've said. Like before. At least a hundred times... Really it's true. Arzu, I miss you so much. I miss Selin. I want everything to be like it was before. We tried, Tamer. It didn't work. This time it's different! This separation really brought me to my senses. I got a place in Nişantaşı. I'm going to open up a chocolate shop. And you'll eat all the liqueur-filled ones. Arzu. Tamer. Yes? Do you remember the night Selin was born? Our trip to the hospital? Of course I do. You almost gave birth in the car. Why? No reason. I have to go. Hello. Ms. Arzu? Is everything alright? You forgot your umbrella in the car the other night. I've brought it back. We weren't really expecting anyone. Come on in. Sorry for the mess. Ayla's father has gotten sick. She went to Gebze with Çiçek. Would you like something to drink? Water. If it's no trouble. Thank you. She's so different in this picture. Yes. People change in time. Care to tell me about it? We met in university. Our last year. I studied economy. She, chemistry. As soon as we graduated I got a job at an accountancy firm. She couldn't find work. Her father made her return home because of the expense. To Gebze. My salary was just enough to look after myself. Marriage didn't seem an option. On the one hand I was working like a dog... ...on the other, I was trying to find work for her. I kept hearing that suitors were always at her door. She didn't know what to do. Just as we were about to give up... ...a new client came to the firm. A chemical company. I moved mountains to get them to hire her. Within a week we were married, rented a place. Of course it was hard at the beginning. But in the end we were lucky. A friend of mine recommended me to Mr. Seyfi at Sistem. An offer came. Just then Ayla became pregnant. How excited we were. Ayla took maternity leave. I would rush home every night. How I missed them. We got a car on credit. When you've a kid, you need one. One weekend... ...to celebrate the purchase and to take a break in the forest... ...we decided to go to a place. The weather was great. The smell of the woods. The colours of the flowers. Oh God. Like we were in a dream. I said 'Ayla, let's call our daughter Çiçek.' And then, the years just passed. She grew up. Even began school. I should get going. Whatever you wish. See you tomorrow. Good bye. Mother look what we have made! Hello. Hi. What's this? From Mr. Tamer. He left this and the flowers. Ms. Arzu, I have to take my mother to the doctor tomorrow. Is it allright if I don't come? Oh dear. Allright. Thank you. Bye bye Selin! Bye bye Betül! - I hope she gets well soon. Good night. - Good night. What did you make? We made a frog, a dog, an elephant. Mother, what's that? Nothing. A letter. A love letter? How do you know about love letters? All right now, to bed. Come on. Hello? Yes Mr. Murat? Last month's? I'll check and call you right back. Good morning. The babysitter's mother is ill. And Tamer... I didn't know what to do. I'll go tell Mr. Seyfi. Be a nice girl, ok? Would you like a candy? Something to drink? No. How about a paper and pen? Ok. What's your name? Güven. Do you have a kid? Güven. We're leaving bright and early tomorrow. Ok? Why waste time? Everything's ready. We're only going for two days. Why waste time? We're leaving bright and early tomorrow. Ok? Imagine when we get up in the morning... ...with all those lovely scents of the forest, bird song... Why waste time? A great breakfast... We're leaving bright and early tomorrow. Ok? Darling... Calm down... Darling... Darling... Darling. Calm down. Let's go. Have a nice nap. I'll play you some nice music. Hurry! Hurry! My sweet little girl is going on holiday. Calm down. We're almost there. Lie back in the seat. Make yourself comfortable. Ok. Ok. We're almost there.
