You? Corner of Dock Street and Third Avenue. You come for the wedding? Clearly. You shouldn't have. And by that I mean you shouldn't have! You? Are getting married? How far along are ya? Ha! My groom has dreamy eyes, and speaks fancy words... - With lots of syllables. - My groom is a cap'n! - Men all over the world speak his name. - Perhaps you've heard of my fiancée? [BOTH AT ONCE:] Jack Sparrow! [BOTH:] Arrgghhh! That scoundrel thinks he can marry the both of us! [ALL LAUGHING AND CHEERING] It's the 'appiest day in a girl's life. My Lords, Chaps, Masters, Esquires and gentlemen of portent. I present to you such loveliness as to make you weep. Such grace as will strike you sober! Each wench, certified virginal! Pure as snowflakes they are! - Leastwise in spirit, if not flesh. - How dare you! - Where's Jack? - Yeah? Now, first item up for bid, twenty pieces of silver, do I hear twenty? - Five! I bid five! - That's not... Five? - Five? - I say that... Five? I have five. Do I hear ten? These are treasures beyond measure. - [MARQUIS D'AVIS:] Twenty for the redhead! - Do I hear thirty? Taking thirty. - Thirty! - Thirty. Do I hear forty? - Fine. Forty for the redhead! - Step aside, Giselle. - We wants the redhead! - It's advertising is it then? Fine. [ALL:] Ooh! - Here's for the one with the flaxen hair! - Ooh, "flaxen"? - [SLURRY GIBSON:] Fifty for the redhead - Fifty. Fifty. Do I hear sixty? [GREGOR:] Sixty! [ATENCO:] Fifteen for the flax... er... for the not redhead. I have been egregiously under-bid upon! [MARQUIS D'AVIS:] Seventy for the redhead! You're not believin' the trickery in those locks are ya? - There's no trickery here! - Oh, then it must be elsewhere, is that it? [SLAP] Coming up from this one you'll be scraping barnacles from the hull for a week! - Stop it! - Oh, wretch. - Stupid widow. - Aahhh! [MUSIC PLAYS] [ALL LAUGH] - Ergh. - Argh. [SCREAMING] [MUSIC DIES AWAY] [CACOPHONY OF CHEERS] Wildcats! I'll bid two hundred for the pair! - Two twenty five! - Offering them as a lot. - Two fifty! - Three hundred! - Three fifty! - We bid four hundred! - We? - We formed a corporation. Five hundred! - Five fifty. - Six hundred! - We bid six... seventeen. - And a goat! Nigel, you love that goat. You love that goat! And a goat! Seven hundred... and two goats! Seven hundred and two goats it is! [ALL:] Owww! - Seven hundred? - We're rich! We have goats! [BOTH SQUEAL] I... I am rich, I have goats. I regret to inform you that, as facilitator of this transaction, I take in form of commission, a fair percentage. - How much? - 100% - You can't do that. - As holder of the property disposed, - in fact I can. - No one owns me. We're not property! - Are they for sale or not? - [ALL:] Yeah? Wait! Lower your cannons... I traded for them fair 'n square, meaning I can do as I like, including re-sell at profit. It says so right over here, - in the hallowed Pirate Code. - Aye, the code be the law, as always. And woe to anyone who shows it any disrespect. [GISELLE CLEARS THROAT] So, for the sake of argument, this stocking I was wearing... [ALL HOOT] Ow, oh God. - You own this? - Absolutely. And if I sang a song, you own that too? - Undoubtedly. - Fine, then own this... [SLAP] [ALL GASP] You're gonna pay for that! No, wait... Sold, to the man with the goat! I only borrowed the goat! Buyer's remorse! They're still yours. [JEROME FIRES A SHOT] Don't you see, this is all the doing of one man... Jack Sparrow! Where?! - I don't believe it, he shot the code. - He shot the code. Cap'n Teague'll have his head. Get him outta here! Be not deterred, gentlemen, I have a fresh consignment of fine Peruvian llamas due in a fortnight. Gently, gently. Lock up the code. Strike the wenches. And if any of ye ever speak a word of this, I'll have your tongue. [COTTON:] Aye, sir, mum's the word. [COTTON'S PARROT:] Mum's the word. Ergh, next time I see him I'll be re-acquainting Jack Sparrow with - with the palm of my hand. - So will I. Not that I don't trust Jack, but in case he got cold feet I thought perhaps taking these out of his boat might slow him down a bit. ♪♪ ["Pyrate Bryde" by Warren Goodlang] ♪ Jenny was green Not yet 17 ♪ ♪ But wiser than her years ♪ ♪ She'd help all the men who she'd not see again ♪ ♪ To overcome their fears ♪ ♪ A pirate bride A pirate bride ♪ ♪ I searched all the seven seas ♪ ♪ For women of fire and lusty desire ♪ ♪ A bonny pirate bride for me ♪ ♪ Alice was fine and loved her wine ♪ ♪ She knew just how to sigh ♪ ♪ And only got drunk a few times a month ♪ ♪ And days that end in "y" ♪ ♪ Carrie would sneeze and probably had fleas ♪ ♪ Her health was not so fair ♪ ♪ What she lacked in mirth she made up in girth ♪ ♪ And lots and lots of hair ♪ ♪ A pirate bride A pirate bride ♪ ♪ I searched all the seven seas ♪ ♪ For women of fire and lusty desire ♪ ♪ A bonny pirate bride for me ♪ ♪ Peggy would limp and look like a chimp ♪ ♪ Her legs were made of wood ♪ ♪ But after we drank she no longer stank ♪ ♪ And rather looked quite good ♪ ♪ A pirate bride A pirate bride ♪ ♪ I searched all the seven seas ♪ ♪ For women of fire and lusty desire ♪ ♪ A bonny pirate bride for me ♪ ♪ A bonny pirate bride for me ♪♪
