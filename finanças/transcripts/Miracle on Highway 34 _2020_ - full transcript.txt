Well, it's Christmas Eve and another year has almost gone by, reminding me of how old I'm getting. But in other news, it looks like there's a snow storm heading off the mountains along the front range. So, if you're in the unfortunate position of having be driving around the mountains on Christmas Eve, might I suggest you do the exact opposite of that and get somewhere safe and warm, unlike this office, which is safe, except when Cheryl's around, but it is definitely not warm. How are we doing? Good. Tired, excited, hungry. All the things, huh? Yeah, all the things. Sounds like you. How are you doing? I'm good, pretty much the same. I am excited, a little nervous, I guess. Yeah, I haven't been home in a long time, but it's time. You still think I'll like it? I know you'll love it. Tell me about it again, Jonathan. Maia, it's beautiful. The house stands at the end of the street, surrounded by quiet trees. Out the back window is a view of the mountains. There's a big red door, which you'll love. And has rooms enough for you, me and. Him. Yeah. The future is bright unlike these roads where I can see nothing. You know, if you need to stop and rest, just let me know. I'm okay, I kinda wanna make some good time and keep on going. Okay. But we will stop maybe like an hour or two, get something to eat stretch our legs. Sound good? - Yeah. - Okay. Can I get you anything else? No, thanks Liz. All right. So any big plans for tomorrow? Well, they have me working until six at which point it will be me in a TV celebrating together. It's a tradition. Well, Merry Christmas. Hey, listen, there's a fresh slice of pie in here for you for tomorrow on the house. Thank you, Liz. Yeah,. I'll see you next year. Take it easy. Hey. Sorry, I didn't see you there. That's quite all right, it's a nice song. How many? Right this way. Can I get you something to drink? You got any scotch? Afraid we're all out. All right, then I'll just have coffee then. Coming right up. There you go and here's your menu. Any cream or sugar? Oh, no, straight up, thanks. You're funny. It's very festive in here. Oh, you know, we try. It's very nice. Thank you. Hey, just let me know when you're ready to order. Okay, will do. No, you can't use Valgrum on Reacher Why can't the squad figure this out? Come on Phase master. Just you tonight, huh? Yeah. So how'd you get stuck here on Christmas Eve, don't you have somewhere to be? Not really, I need the money. Ah, I hear you on that. Besides my mom's with her new boyfriend, who's kind of a jerk so. Ah, well, glad I won't be here alone. You're a good company. You bet ya, Liz. I'll keep you safe if any bad guys come in. I feel safe already. Yeah. Hey, boss. Oh, hey, Liz. Merry Christmas. Same to you, thanks. Listen, it's pretty quiet out there. I don't think it's gonna pick up any time soon. Why don't you go home, enjoy your holiday? That's really sweet, Liz, but I got a lot of work to catch up on. The new year's creeping up. Okay. Let me know if you need anything. Will do, thanks, Liz, you're the best. Sheila, you doing okay? Yeah, yeah. Ah, that's for me, all right. Hey, you're awake. Hey, yourself. Get any sleep? A little bit, yeah. Good, you have any crazy dreams? Yeah. I had a dream that we were in our little house, happy and warm. I'm so sorry. As soon as I get my last paycheck I will fix this heater. It's a top of my list, I promise. How are you holding up? Wonderfully. You scared at all? Absolutely, absolutely. But don't worry, we've got this. I have yours too. Hey there, how many? Just me. Thanks. There you go. How's that coffee? Best cup I ever had. You know you're not supposed to lie on Christmas. You got me, second best then. Okay, okay. So, did you decide if you want anything to eat? I'll just have some scrambled eggs and some toast. Hmm, I mean, I know it's the holiday and all, but let's not go too crazy. I think I've used up all my crazy for this life. All right, scrambled eggs and toast it is. Could you make it wheat, please? Gotcha. - Hey, Nick. - Yeah? Can I get two scrambled eggs and a side of wheat toast, please? On it. And what are you having? Is your salmon fresh? Fresh out the freezer. I guess I'll have the rib eye. Medium and mashed potatoes, no gravy. You got it. Nice watch you got there. Oh, thanks, it's a present from the boss for working on Christmas. Wish I had a boss like that. One of the perks, I guess. Where you from? New York. Oh yeah, what do you do? I sell pharmaceuticals. You like it? It pays the bills. Never a shortage of sick people, huh? Even ones in the middle of nowhere. Life on the road can be hard, you know. What do you do? Trucker, 13 years now. Wow. I keep telling myself I'd stop for the last 12, but here I am. Why don't you stop? It's what I know. It's a grind, but it's familiar. And sometimes the familiar life that we hate, feels safer than the unfamiliar life that we dream of, you know. Never thought of it that way. We all get used to traveling down the same roads, well, for me quite literally. But to turn on to new one is scary. Maybe I'll try it sometime. Robert Frost. Friend of yours? No, the poet? He wrote the poem about the road less traveled. Never really had time for poetry, but sounds like a smart guy. I guess. We never really do out what happens to him at the end of the poem, just that it made all the difference. Maybe that's enough. Or maybe that's how you end up in diners in the middle of nowhere. Well, at least the coffee ain't bad. Wait, what? Well, is there some sort of payment plan I can work out? I understand it's just, this week? No, yeah, I know, I did and I'm trying, but sir, sir, it's Christmas. Can I at least have until New Years? Okay. Okay, no, I'll figure something out. Everything, okay? You heard that? Is there anything I can do? Just might have to give me a few more shifts? I think we can arrange that. Yeah. Here you are. And scrambled eggs and wheat toast, threw in the side of bacon. Looks great, thanks. So, Liz, tell me, why are you working the late shift on Christmas Eve? Ah, well, that's the story longer than anyone wants to hear. Well, I got all night. Well, you first. Why are you here in the middle of nowhere tonight, don't you have family somewhere? I got a daughter. Haven't spoken to her for a few years, don't think she really wants to hear from me. I wasn't exactly a great dad, you know. So, staying on the road keeps me busy. Keeps my mind off of things. That's not true. What's not? That your daughter doesn't wanna hear from you. Maybe. Absolutely. Apparently she's going up to college at Melview, studying literature. Sounds like a smart girl. Yeah, she is. Every daughter wants to know her dad. Yeah, well, it's your turn. My turn. I don't know. Honestly, hun, someone's gotta pay the bills. No one waiting up for you? Let's just say I went through a lot of frogs waiting for Prince Charming to come to the rescue. Think he got lost somewhere. Well, I'm sure he'll be coming through those doors any minute now. Hmm, well, until then, I'll be here with fresh refills of coffee. So, what about you? It's Kyle. Yeah, why are you here tonight? Work. Did you lose a bet? No, just the only one without a wife and kids. So, you're not married? I'm married to my work. Oh yeah. Love at first sight? I live in a penthouse overlooking Central Park and fly everywhere first class, so, you know. No, I don't. Wait a minute, hun. So you're telling me a handsome young man like yourself, has no one to keep you warm? No more than a night at a time, which is good by me, easier that way. Easier isn't always better. Maybe, but it is easier. Touche. The service here is useless. - Liz. - Yeah. Do you have WiFi? No, darling, I'm sorry, we don't. Of course. But we do have The Snippets. The what? The Snippets, it's the local paper. It's a great article on the front page about the mysterious snowman in front of Ms. Clark's yard. And there's a nice little comic Officer Bill drew on page five. Want one? Yeah, I'm good, thanks. I'll take one. Yeah. I like hard hitting articles and I love comics. Yeah, see, that's what I'm talking about. Jonathan, it's snowing. I see that. I've never seen snow before, it's so beautiful. It can be, though it can be kinda dangerous too. Hopefully it's just a little bit. It looks so soft and delicate, new. Slippery and soft and delicate. He kicked! Oh yeah. He likes it too. Still don't know how you know it's a he. I just do, trust me. Okay. I have dreams too, you know. You getting hungry? A little bit, yeah. Okay, there's not much around here that I see, but I think a little way down there should be a gas station, We'll get some snacks and hopefully there's a hotel, we might be able to stop for the night. That good? - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, come on. Oh, would you look at that. It looks like we might have a white Christmas after all. Yeah, well, it better not delay my flight back to the city. It might be nice. Take a good day off, relax, enjoy Christmas. Yeah, for your, maybe. What, you don't like taking a day off? Not, not really. Well, maybe you just need to learn how to relax a little bit, you know. Yeah, maybe. Tell ya, there's nothing quite like just waking up with nothing to do and just grabbing a cup of something hot and just zoning out, you know. Yeah, I prefer something a little more intellectually stimulating. Well, if that's the case, there is an article in here about a piano recital. I think you will like it. Thanks for the tip. You boys doing okay? Doing great. How's that steak coming? Oh my goodness, let me check. Superman, how's that dinner coming? Good, good. I was just a tenderizing the potatoes. Well, I think the potatoes are many tenderized. Yeah, yeah, you're probably right. Back to it. Liz, you've seen the new "Space Warriors" movie? Can't say that I have, Nick. Well, I was thinking that you kinda remind me of Captain Gold. Is that a good thing? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. She's like the strong and brave, but still kindhearted captain who keeps the whole ship together and saves the planet. That's quite an honor. You know, I'mma have to check out this new "Space Warriors" movie. Yeah, it's really good, you'd like it. All right, back to work. Aye, aye, captain. So, there were some the delays with the potatoes, but it should be out soon. Okay, in the meantime, here's a slice of my famous apple crumble. Oh, I don't eat... Thanks. Wow, it's actually quite good. Thank you, hun, I'm glad you like it. So, you have a picture of her? Who? Your daughter. Yeah, this one is, wow, five years ago. I was driving through the town where her and her mother lived and Victoria asked me if I could stop by. Victoria, that's a pretty name. Yeah. Might be the only thing I did right, to name her. She's a beautiful young woman. I'm afraid her mom had more to do with that than me. Oh, stop it, you're a very handsome man. Oh, thanks, so are you. I mean, you're a handsome woman. So, what happened with you and her mom? If you don't mind. Oh, not at all. I was young and stupid, doing some work in a small town, met a pretty girl and started making mistakes. Classic story. Tried to make it work, or at least she did. I was a little too immature at that point and was drinking, running around, made a lot of mistakes. Yeah, well, we all have. Welcome to the club. Your daughter, she's not a mistake. You're lucky, you should call her. Yeah. Hey, Sheriff Bill. Hey, Liz. So, to what do we owe this visit this fine Christmas Eve? Hope our carousing wasn't too loud. Well, not loud enough, far as I'm concerned. That's right. Well look, the reason I came in is I'm on patrol tonight and well, I've been hearing about a pretty big blizzard coming our way. Yup, they already closed the Monument Hill Pass. Great. Wow. You know, you coulda called. Oh yeah, I guess I could've, Heh. You want some coffee? Oh, I'd love some. Right this way. Gents. There you are. Oh, thank you, darling. You're welcome. You should try the apple crumble, it's good. Yes, it is. You know, I'd like a piece of that apple crumble, if you've got any left. Yes, sir, one last serving. A steak dinner up? Order up. All right, thank you. Steak dinner and apple crumble. Oh boy, thank you. You're welcome, there you are. Thanks. Accounts. Yes. Check balance. What, are you kidding me? I can't be overdrawn. I just deposited a check three days ago. Customer service please. Customer ser, hello? Stupid robot. Oh hey, Liz. Sleeping on the job, ey, boss? I guess it's catching up to me after all. Yeah, you've been working late a lot this past month. Yeah. You okay? It's been a year, you know, that he. I know. You doing all right? I thought I would be fine. Maybe if I just kept myself busy, that I could get through the season. I've felt that way before. But I think it's catching up with me. I don't bounce back as fast as I used to. You're kidding me, come on, you're in the prime of your life. It's hard going home to an empty house. Yeah, it is. 33 years we were together. All the laughter, traditions, kisses, songs, then he's just gone like that. I used to race home just so that I could be with him. Doctor said it was too late to operate, too late to save the only thing in this world I truly loved. He used to love Christmas songs. We'd put them on our old record player and we'd dim the lights and in front of the fireplace, we'd danced the night away every Christmas. Our own traditions, just us in our little home. Those rooms are too quiet now, empty. I'm sorry, boss. No, I'm sorry, this is a happy night for most. I'm just moping. Oh, no, Sheila it's okay to feel those things. You're right. The thing is I wouldn't trade one minute with him to get rid of this pain. It was worth it all. Yeah, you're blessed, even if only for 33 years, you had something the rest of the world longs for. Liz, my girl, it's never too late. You're a special one, keep looking. Okay, boss. I think I might go home. Yeah, I think that's a good idea, beat the storm. You feel okay here? Do you feel safe? Oh yeah, of course. Besides, I've got, got my fierce superhero warrior to protect me. Merry Christmas, Li. Merry Christmas, boss. Wait a minute, wait a minute. So, you're telling me that people in New York city can just jaywalk across any old street and the cops won't do anything? I am, it's just how it works. Amateurs, crazy city people. Well, they need to come down here and see how real law enforcement works. Oh yeah, some crazy stuff going on around here? Son, you wouldn't believe it. Things I've seen with my own two eyes would shock you. Really? Well, just last week, Mrs. Lasseter attacked her neighbor with a garden hose. It wasn't pretty, I had to break them up. And then, the week prior, up on Fiddler's Point, I caught the pastor's daughter kissing some delinquent in the backseat of a car. You're kidding me? They're just kids and they were just kissing. In the back seat. Back seats are made for babies, not for making 'em like the good Lord intended. And it was like trying to break up two cats covered in peanut butter. You're doing God's work, Bill. Well, I try. So, you tell them city boy, cops, if they need any tips or tricks, they need to come on down here and talk to old Sheriff Bill. I'll show them how it's done. Oh, I will, I absolutely will. Yeah, thank you. You know, the next day I ran to the pastor's daughter, we had a good talk. I mean, she just needs time and a listening ear. She's a good girl. Like you? Ah, ha, I don't know about that. So, have you always lived in this little town? Yeah, for a long time. I was a foster kid, came here when I was 18 and out looking for work. I went to church one Sunday, you know, looking for some free potluck food and ran into Sheila and her husband, Craig, and they offered me a job and here I am. Do you ever think about leaving? Ah, every day. Why haven't you? I don't know. Not enough time, not enough money, especially now. Had some medical expenses last year that I just can't keep up with. Besides couldn't do that to Sheila, you know, now that Craig has passed. That's gotta be rough. Yeah. But you know, this is what I know. Good people. Oh, I get it. But no man has ever caught your eye? One did for a minute. Yeah, what happened? I don't know, I was young looking for someone to love me. He was handsome, good talker. He made vows that I thought meant something different than he did. I mean, he knew all the right things to say, but few years later, he found someone else to say 'em to. I don't know, I mean, I can't complain though, right? I've got a good job, warm bed, endless supply of romance novels and free coffee. Ah, sounds like you got it made. Ah, yeah, I do you should be jealous. And I am. I'm gonna get some refills, you want some? I'll take a top off. Yeah. What'd they say? No luck, they filled the last room about a half an hour ago. I wish we sure you were just there already. Yeah, me too, listen, I'm sorry, I'm really trying my... I know. In no time, we will be back in my hometown and you're gonna love it. You think so? Yeah, you will. I mean, it's gonna have everything we don't have right now. Warm beds, warm drinks, warm everything. Okay. I'm doing this for us, you know, everything we have ahead. Trust me? Of course. California had nothing left for us. I know, I just, it's all I've ever known. I'm just kind of scared. Maia, of course. Listen, this time next year, we're going to have a new life and a new home and a new. Yeah. Yeah. Did you ever think when we first met that we'd be here? Yeah. Oh, really love at first sight? Yes. Right there at poetry night. We didn't meet there. No, but I was there. You went up to read I saw you. You were right? wow. But the first time we met was that Justin's birthday party. And you were wearing that members only jacket. Oh yeah. And you smelled very heavily of cheap cologne. Oh no. And the first thing you ever said to me was, "that shade of burgundy really brings out your eyes." I was trying to be poetic. I thought you were just the cutest boy I'd ever seen. They said there's another town about an hour down the way. Should we try our luck there? Yeah. Okay, say prayer. I always do. Well, here in Cortland County, it looks like we're going to be having any white Christmas. And a very white Christmas at that. That snow storm is shaping up to be one of the biggest we've seen in years. I've already directed you that you stay inside and off the roads, which most likely means, I'm spending the night here. But its fine, my jacket makes a great blanket. Be safe out there and Merry Christmas. So Sheriff, what's the odds of me getting to the airport? What, now, tonight? Yeah, I got a red eye back to the city. Well, son, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid with the pass closed, you aren't going anywhere. Right. Well, looks like you're spending Christmas here. It looks that way. Any good hotels around here? Only one and it's all booked up. Well, I guess I'll have a cup of coffee then, please. Coming right up. So, you know, there could be worse places to spend Christmas Eve. Yeah, well, there's better ones. Tell me, Kyle, why you so anxious to get back? I don't know, I, I don't have anyone waiting for me. I'm not going by to anyone. I don't even really like my job. Then why do you do it? 'Cause I make a lot of money. That's it, just for the money? You know, I used to really wanna be a doctor. I was so passionate, so passionate, so stupid. I spent five years, medical school, ER, residency, the whole nine yards. So what happened? Look, I'm not gonna give you a whole sob story, but after getting dragged into a nightmare lawsuit for helping save someone's life, I got kinda burned out on the whole altruism thing, started focusing on helping myself. Do you like your life? Do you? I mean, really, happiness is a fantasy. At least I can take care of myself. I'm in control of my life, enjoy nice things. It's as good as you can hope for it. I don't agree. I mean, in what, what, three minutes, we'll be celebrating a day that remembers that love, caring, sacrifice, that matters in the end, not all that other stuff. You really believe all that? I have to, hun, I don't have much else. Well, hey, hey, it's almost Christmas. I think I actually have some apple cider in the back. Why don't you say I'll pop some open, so we can celebrate? - Yeah. - Sounds nice. Hey Nick, can you grab a couple of the sparkling ciders from the back, come on out here? All right, captain, I got it. I'm fine. There you go. Can you help me with that? We're almost here. I know, we got about what, 60 seconds? There you go. Help you there. All right, all right. Thank you, darling. Yeah, you're welcome. Oh, very nice. We need to toast. Yeah, go for it. Oh no, no, no, this is you. You are the host of this fine party. Ah, okay, okay. Well, all right, here we go. To truck stop diners, to snowy nights, to the rich and the poor, to brave warriors, to strangers becoming friend. And to what this day is all about, love, second chances, redemption and peace. - Here, here. - Here, here. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah. - Woo-hoo. - Nice. Well, I found some leftovers to the kitchen. Sorry, Karen, but I'm hungry. And to all of you out there, it is now officially midnight. Merry Christmas. Maia. - Maia, wake up. - What's happening? It's Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I love you. I love you. How are you doing? Good, hanging in there. How are you? Cold, tired, excited, hungry. All the things. Yeah. Still, makes sense. Man, it is really coming down out there. Yeah. Do you think you're okay to drive? Yeah, yeah, we'll be fine. Okay. I've always loved this song. It's such peace in the mist, you know, kinda what the season is all about. Yeah, I've always been a little partial to "Oh, Holy Night". I was driving an all night or last couple of weeks before Christmas last year, up in the bad lands. And I don't know if you've ever been up there, but it's out in the middle of nowhere and you can see that sky from horizon to horizon. And there was no moon, no clouds out, stars are really, really bright. So, I pulled the truck over and cut the lights off and just stood there. It was amazing, you could see millions of stars. And after about 20, 25 minutes, I got back on my truck and turned on the radio and "Oh, Holy Night" was on. And it's got that part about, "the stars are brightly shining." It was perfect. Kyle, how about you? What's your favorite Christmas song? Well, it wasn't really celebrated, Christmas, growing up, so, I don't have much of a connection to it. But I do remember the first week I got to New York, I stumbled into St. Patrick's one night as they performed the "Hallelujah Chorus" by Handel. It struck me as being so beautiful. Made me wish I was part of it somehow, or maybe that it was more a part of me. Then the music ended, walked out the door, back into real life. If I had to say a favorite, I guess it would be that one. I always liked "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer". When I was a kid, my dad would turn it up and we'd sing it real loud when he would take us around in this big old cop cruiser looking at holiday lights. That was nice, Bill. Hey, do you guys mind if I read the Christmas story? it's kind of a tradition I have. Not at all. Sure. All right. Okay. Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was with child. While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn. In the same region, there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them and the glory of the Lord shone around them and they were terribly frightened. But the angel said to them, "do not be afraid, "for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, "which will be for all the people. "For today, in the city of David, "there has been born for you, a savior, "who is Christ the Lord. "This will be a sign for you. "You will find a baby wrapped in cloths "and lying in a manger." And suddenly, there appeared with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, "glory to God in the highest. "And on Earth, peace among men with whom he is pleased." When the angels had gone away from them into heaven. the shepherds began saying to one another, "let us go straight to Bethlehem then "and see this thing that has happened, "which the Lord has made known to us." So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph and the baby as he lay in the manger. When they had seen this, they made known the statement, which had been told them about this child. And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds. And Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart. The shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them. Wow, it's really picking up out there. Yeah, it is. I wouldn't want to be caught out there in that. Maia, you okay? Maia? Jonathan? - What's up? - Jonathan? Yes. He's coming. What? Like he's, right now? Yeah. Right now? - You okay? - Yeah, no, yeah, yeah. - Are you sure? - Oh my gosh. Okay. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay, okay. We got this, we got this. He's coming right now. - Yes. - Okay. All right, here we go. Okay, oh boy, okay, here we go. I call. Go fish. Royal flush. Hey, came back to help you out a little bit. You don't have to do that. It's the least I could do. Thank you, Daniel. You know, I remember the first time I went to Alaska, that was the first time I got to see the ocean. A long, long way from my hometown, you know. I'd never been that far North or West for that matter. You drive towards the ocean, things start changing a little bit, you know. Sky gets a little different. The air smells a little different, you know. I'll never forget that second I came over that hill and saw the ocean almost knocked my breath away. I drove down to the beach, got out of my rig, 'cause I don't like to let these moments pass. And I just stood there and just was in awe of the power and the strength of the ocean, you know. Yeah. I think you might like to see that one day. Yeah, yeah, I think I would. Are you still open? What do you mean? Do you want me to shut the sign off? No, let's leave it on. You never know who may need a warm drink on a night like this. Hey, you wanna help me take some of these back to the counter? Sure thing. Well, we've been getting reports all over the county of huge snow drifts. The storm should stop within the next few hours, which should give me time to finish my game of solitaire. But the temperatures will continue to stay low, making it dangerous to drive. So, stay inside, enjoy the snow covered landscape and tell someone you love them. Well, it's been quite a night. Sorry, you guys get stuck with me. Oh, I'm not sorry at all. It's better being alone out on the highway for Christmas. Yeah, fine company. Agreed. It's been an honor. Well, it looks like it's been a little too much for some of us. Okay, how are we doing, you doing okay? Gosh, yeah, just great, wonderful. What's going on? It's fine, it's just a contraction, it's fine. Yeah, okay, I see you lights ahead. - Yeah? - Yes. Yes, those are the lights. Okay, we made it. - Thank God. - There's the town right there, yes, okay. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, here we go, wait. What? I don't know how to deliver a baby. It's not that hard, you just, you pull? Yeah, yeah, like the movies. Okay. Okay, okay, here we go. Oh, why are you slowing down? I gotta take the turn, so we don't fly off the road. Good thinking. - Yeah. - Right. Okay, there's a motel up ahead. - Okay, we've go this. - Great. Okay, be right back, just, it's okay. Okay, be right back. Okay. Oh, come on! Okay. So, any room? No, actually, but it's okay, I have a plan. What are you talking about? What do you mean? Just, it's gonna be okay. Just trust me, okay? Okay. I love you. I love you. Okay. Hey Liz, you better get in here. Please, my wife is in labor. We didn't have anywhere else to go. Oh my goodness, come in, come in, hurry, hurry. Guys, come on, let's put these tables together and lay her down, come on. Honey, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Come on, come on. Hey Nick, can you grab some water, get all the blankets you can from the back? Daniel, can you get to the back, call the doctor? The phone number is right above the phone. You got it. I'll guard the door. Kyle, can you run to the... Okay, I need you to take deep breaths for me. Slow, deep breaths, good. How far apart are the contractions? I don't know, two minutes. That's okay.

Listen, you're gonna be okay. Kyle here, he's a doctor. Okay, Maia and... - Jonathan. - Jonathan. I've done this before, everything's gonna be okay. Is it okay if I help you? Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna need a first aid kit and some scissors. Nick, grab that please. Just gonna cover you up here. Need those jeans off. Okay, let's get your jacket off too. Come on, let's get this off. You're doing great, babe. Yeah? - Yeah. - I love you. I love you. Liz, no answer from the doctor's office. The hospital up north said they can't make it over the pass tonight. Okay, thank you, Daniel. Are we gonna be okay? Yeah, everything is gonna be fine. Look at me, everything is gonna be fine, okay. You're a strong person, I can tell. Is it all right if I check up on you? You're doing so good. So good, beautiful. It's gonna be fine. How is she looking? Wow, the baby's already crowning. What does that mean? It means you're son's almost here. What? Okay, in a second, I'm gonna tell you to push three times in a row. All right, try for 10 seconds. No matter how much it hurts, I want you push as hard as you can, all right. Okay. Just breathe through it. You're gonna be fine, okay. - You ready? - You can do this. Okay. One, two, three. Great job, doc. The perimeter is secure. Hey Victoria, it's me, it's your father. Listen, I know we haven't spoken in a long time and that's my fault, I should have called and been there more often, but I'm sorry and I wanna change that. Anyway, it's Christmas and I want to let you know I'm coming through town in a couple of weeks and if you were okay with it, I'd love to get together with you. Just call me back and let me know if that's all right. I know, I didn't really show it, but I wanna let you know, I always love you, darling. Merry Christmas. Good morning. Everybody doing okay? Yeah. Doing pretty good. Nick, for your incredible bravery in the face of childbirth last night, I'd like to make you an honorary sheriff's deputy. You need a ride home? That'd be great, Sheriff Bill. Let's go. All right. Well, there he is. Congratulations. - Thanks. - Welcome to the club, man. How do you feel? I'm not quite sure yet, but I think good. I think really good. Fair enough. Hey, thank you both for last night. I don't know what we would have done without you, so. You're welcome. How are you? I'm good, I'm so tired, but good. I thought you might like some tea. Oh, thank you, that's perfect. Can you hold him? Yeah. Wow. He's so beautiful. He has his daddy's eyes. Yeah. You're a mom now. I know I'm so scared, but I'm really, really happy. Oh, you're gonna do great. I think we're gonna get on the road, get her home. Hey. Oh hi. Thought you might like a donut. You have no idea. So good. Good to see your back to your normal self. Daddy. Hey, buddy. Would you like to hold him? Yeah. Make sure you get his head. Okay, got it. - You got him? - Yeah. Oh my God. Look at him, he's looking at you. He looks like me, doesn't he? He does. How you doing? That's your mom. I should probably get on the road myself. Kyle, I'm gonna be swinging by the airport. Be happy to give you a lift. Oh wow, that'd be great, thanks. Yeah. Kyle, are you coming? Yeah, one second. So you make sure you give us a call when you get in. We will, I promise. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Anytime, baby. - Okay. - Take care. You ready? Yeah. Oh, how much for the pie? The apple crumble, it's on the house. Okay, well, I left you a little extra tip, so. Thank you. I hope everything works out for you. Hey. Kyle, I'm proud of you. - Thank you. - Yeah. I don't know really how to do this, but I think you are a wonderful, strong, beautiful woman. And I want to get to know you more. And I know it's Christmas, but I'm gonna be coming back in a couple of weeks. And I was hoping it'd be okay if I just took you out on a proper date? Yeah, yeah, of course. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much, thank you. Thank you. I'll call you. Okay. Yes. So, Eric, how's your New Year's? Ah, you know, making resolutions, breaking them already. You know, I think next year is gonna be my year. Yeah. Well, I'm hoping the same thing for me too. Well, happy new year, Liz. Happy New Year to you, thank you. Okay.
