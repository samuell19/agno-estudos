Subtitles by explosiveskull The leaders come off turn two with only three laps to go. Bob Linsky in the white number 33 car has a razor-thin lead over Cam Munroe in midnight blue number two. These two have been scrapping it out all season long here in super late model race. They sure have, Jimmy. Cam Munroe drives for his dad and crew chief, local racing legend, Sam "The Man" Munroe. He might be the best dirt track racer I've ever seen. And hold on right there! Cam Munroe dives inside with a slick pass on Linsky. - He's done it! - Yeah! Straight up amazing driving. Yes! This race is coming right down to the wire here at Talladega, with only one lap to go. We might be seeing a changing of the guard right here with young Cam Munroe in the lead. Can he hold onto the win? Oh! Oh, no, no, no! Smoke from under the hood of the number two car of Cam Munroe. Whoa! Big problems rumbling here for Team Munroe. That engine's been a problem all season. And there goes Bob Linsky ripping past Cam Munroe. Looks like Cam Munroe is gonna be a bridesmaid here tonight. His car dying completely just shy of the finish line. The checkered flag goes up for Bob "Lead Foot" Linsky, who clinches the championship with this win, making it three titles in a row for Linsky. Well, Jimmy, racing has a heck of a lot to do with the driver, but you gotta have the car to back it up on the track. Yeah. The Munroe car is fast when it runs, but it's been plagued by engine problems all season, and there's definitely no love lost between Sam Munroe and Bob Linsky. For sure. I know Cam Munroe will be back next season, but right now it's Bob Linsky's moment in the sun as he takes his victory lap, and the fans here at Talladega let him know they appreciate his win. What a good day for you. David, do you mind helping Cam load up his car? I gotta go to work. Super! All right. Whoo! We're ready for you. Pick your weapon. - Uh... Gold. - Gold, all right. Bait your hook. I'm not gonna have to touch a worm, am I? Hell no! I don't use worms, I use hot dogs. - Pinch a little off like that. - Okay. And we take our hook, you gotta be careful with the hook, and we just hook it on real good so it doesn't fall off. All right. Now, stand up. Now, I'm gonna come and reach around you like this. - Mm-hm. - I like this part. Now, seriously, why did you move down here? - After the divorce... - Yeah. ...I just... I just needed to get away from Steve and... and everything that reminded me of our life together, you know? - Mm-hm. - When I got offered the teaching job at a reasonable salary in this quaint little town, I jumped at the chance. Well, I sure am glad you did. Yeah, me too. I opened up. What about you? Mm-hm. We don't have to talk about that. No. it's all right. You're right. You told me your story. Why can't I tell you mine? Um... Jen and I, we grew up together, and she was the first girl I kissed. You know, we always knew we were gonna get married, and... she saw something in me that nobody else did, including my father. I mean, I felt like I could win races and bag trophies, and... and I did for a while. What happened? Well, she... she died and... and, uh, it was, uh, - it was in a car accident. - I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's a part of me, you know. I don't know why, I just thought of this. When I was senior in high school, my friend Stumpy and I, we got kicked out of school for doing donuts in the parking lot. And, uh, it was my dad's '64 Galaxy. And, uh... Just 'cause you talked about school, or it just stirred up - a school memory or something. - What are donuts? Mm. You like it? I've never done one before. - Oh! - This is my first time. Oh, great! Hey, champ! Is that supposed to be funny? Depends on how you look at it, I guess. I could see you're all pissed off, and I guess I would be too if I was you. What's that supposed to mean? It just means that you got a whole bunch of talent, son... but it ain't gonna do you no good 'cause you got horseshit equipment. Is there any point to this conversation, or do you just like to hear yourself talk? I'm just trying to help. Come on up and talk to me. Just man to man. We'll have a chat. No big deal, no pressure. No nothing. No harm in listening. I'm your friend, don't forget it. - Tell me about your hobby. - Hobby? - Yeah, racing. - Hell no. Racing ain't no hobby. It's more like a family tradition. My... My dad taught me, and I taught Cam. - Your dad raced? - Oh, hell, yeah. And then my cousins still race, and my uncles did race. I... I think my... my mom would've raced too if, if my dad had let her. Some of my best memories are... are tied up with racing. When I was 12, my dad wanted me to ride so bad, he took a seat and bolted it into his race car. And he, uh... he didn't have a second crash helmet, so he asked me to use my football helmet, and, uh, we went around the track once, and by the end of that time, I was sold. This was for me. - Cheers. - Cheers. I'm gonna eat it. I'm gonna eat it. You can have it. There you are, I finally got her to calm down. She's getting so big. Please say something. - Like what? - Anything. You haven't said a word since you got home. I talked to Bob Linsky today. Why'd you talk to him? He offered me a job running his service center. You know how much extra money that would pay? Is that all you guys talked about? He's entering a new car next season. He wants me to drive it for him. - You already have a ride. - I know. You're not thinking of taking him up on his offer, are you? I don't know what I'm gonna do. Riding for your dad is one thing, but riding for that son of a bitch is dangerous, in more ways than one. I hate to think what your dad would say. I don't care what he'd say. This is my life we're talking about, Cindy, not my father's. Great, now you made her cry. This is what I'm talking about. We live in this lousy tin can, and we can't even have a conversation without waking the baby. This tin can happens to be your family's home. Look, what you want me to do? You want me to be a loser all my life? I want to win races. I want to be a champion, but that's something I'll never be racing for my dad. Have you talked to him about this? Look, it's bad enough riding for someone else, but riding for Bob Linsky? You know that won't fly with your dad. He'll fire you, son or no son. - Big frigging deal. - Cam, it is a big deal. We got a baby now. What are we gonna do for money? I told you that if I drive for Linsky, he said he'll give me a job at his service center. I can't believe you trust this guy. Hey, you. I wish I could get this man to pay his bills. Dad, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Pull up a chair. All right. What's on your mind? I don't want you take this the wrong way, but I think it's time I made a change. All right. Let's hear it. I'm not gonna race for you anymore. What was that? What did you just say? I'm not gonna drive for you anymore. I've thought about it a long time. There's no other way. Hell, I thought you liked racing too much to give it up. I'm not giving up racing. Oh, now, son, how you gonna pull that off? You know you don't have the money for that. I accepted an offer from Bob Linsky. - Linsky? - Take it easy. - I know you don't like... - "Don't like him" is an understatement. He's a snake. He's a... He's a piece of shit. You get involved with the likes of him, and I guarantee you'll get hurt. Please try to understand. - No, I understand perfectly. - No! No, you don't. - Oh, yes, I do! - With Linsky in my corner, I'm gonna be an instant competitor for the championship. Championship means more than your father? It means more than your loyalties? It means more to you than your blood? Now, I did not bring you up that way. Believe me, not racing for you is the hardest decision - I've ever had to make. - Apparently not. Hold on. Ho... Ho... Hold on. You're fired. Fucking Linsky! Cindy, wait up! Hey! Wait up! Cindy! Hey! What did you want me to do? I know I should've told you first, okay? How we doing, Sam? I'll have a beer. Just trying to drown my sorrows, that's all. You wanna tell me about it? That bad, huh? I hear ya. You wanna give me a hint? I'll take that as a no. Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you and me go fishing? Shit, we haven't been fishing in years. Come on, it'll make you feel better. I'll pick you up early in the morning. We'll go down to our fishing hole. Come on, it'll just be like old times. So, if it ain't the great Sam "The Man" Munroe. Fuck you, Jack. I ain't signing no autographs tonight. Autograph? It's been a long time since you were somebody. Hey, can't you see the man wants to be left alone? What's it been, Sam? Five, six years since you ever won a race? Don't push it, Jack. - No, no. Let him. - Hey... - Let him. - We always got next year. Mm-hm. You may finish in the top ten. Hell, you may even win a race, but I doubt it. What am I thinking? Not in that shitty equipment that you got. But hey, don't take my word for it. Ask your son. I told him not to push. He thinks it's all about equipment. I'm gonna prove to him I'm still the better driver. - Watch your step. - He thinks I'm nothing. I'm a good man. He'll remember it when I die. He'll remember that I'm a good man. He knows you're a good man now. No, he don't. He... No, he don't. All right. End of the line. Home sweet home. You ready? You sure cold cocked him. All right. Watch your step. Right here in this rocker here. Here we go. You gonna be all right? Okay. Night, killer. Oh, God. Sam? Sam? Hey! I gotta be dreaming. How are you? - I'm good. - What time is it? What happened to your hand? - Jack Dunn. - Who is Jack Dunn? That's a good question. - You know this looks pretty bad. - Oh, hell, it's fine. I just need some aspirin. I drank too much last night. Well, I need to get you inside. I want to put some ice on this. Well, that's mighty neighborly of you. Oh. Come on in. - Welcome. - Let me bandage this. - Got any Band-Aids? - In the garage. Please don't do that. I'm sorry I was just taking a look. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. Don't worry about it. Is this a '70? I'm impressed, How'd you know that? Growing up, my dad always had Mustangs. How long have you had it? - A long time. - Does it run? Been a while. Oh, boy! Running like shit. That would be that big God damn boat anchor you got there. Face it, Sam. You need a new bullet under that... I don't got that kind of money. Well, you better find it, because you're gonna end up looking like a fool. I'm fine with what I got. You've been saying that for the last three years. Look where it's gotten you. I'll tell you where. Nowhere. You're starting to sound like Cam. Well, I hate to say it, but Cam is right. I don't wanna talk about it. That's what a motor sounds like. I'll be damned. What'd you think of that, kid? It's a fast son of a bitch, huh? - Never been in anything faster. - You're God damn right. All you gotta do now is just do the same thing when it counts, right? If anything goes wrong with that heap of shit, you let me know, and I'll fix it right up - for you, okay? - All right. Good job. Twelve laps of racing action in the super late model division. There will be three heats with the top six cars going to the main event. The rest of the cars go to the trailer. It's time to pound the dirt in the first heat of the night. Here we go! We have Cam Munroe in the lead in a brand spanking new ride, now racing for Bob Linsky's team. That's right. Like a true Southern soap opera. Cam jumped ship to Linsky's team, and he's got a shiny new ride that is fast as thunder and lightning all tied up in a bow. His dad's not happy. Here comes the checkered flag for Cam Munroe as he takes heat number one in super late model. That kid is gonna be a winner one day. That's if his father is not in the race. - I'm telling you. - You're very sentimental. Yes, I am, but I can judge character. This is mine now. We're nearing the end of heat number two, and this one has been all Bob "Lead Foot" Linsky tonight. He's picking up right where he left off last season with that bad ass number 33 car. Hell, it even seems faster, if that's possible. Tonight, we are seeing the return of one of the greatest drivers to ever grace the dirt oval. Sam "The Man" Munroe. Certainly no driver has won more races here, but Sam hasn't driven on a track in six years, so he's gotta be rusty. And now he's mixed up in the crazy soap opera that has his son, Cam, racing for his old arch rival Bob Linsky. Hell, you can't write this any better. Heat number three is winding down, and Sam Munroe seems to have shaken off the cobwebs and is leading. Can he hold on? And Sam Munroe takes victory here in heat number three, putting on a clinic in old-school, hard-nosed, dirt track racing. It's going to be an interesting main event tonight, folks. Sam Munroe and his son, Cam Munroe, will be going toe to toe right up in the front of the pack with the bad boy of dirt track himself, Bob Linsky. Should be extremely entertaining as there was never any love lost between Sam Munroe and Bob Linsky. 18 cars on the track. Here we go! The green flag drops, and the family reunion is in full force tonight in Talladega, Alabama. Power racing right from the start here tonight, with Linsky and Cam Munroe already starting to walk away from the field. Sam Munroe included. I just don't know if Sam has the machine to hang with Linsky's new car. There they are, side by side. It's Linsky and Cam Munroe looking like figure skaters putting on a show for the crowd. And Linsky pulls out in front now. Here comes Sam Munroe barreling around the outside going for a gutsy pass on his son. Sam Munroe and Linsky, two of the best ever, tangled going into turn one. This crowd loves it. It's Cam Munroe, Linsky, and Sam Munroe battling back and forth now. And there goes Sam Munroe around Linsky. - Wow, how does he do that? - Bob Linsky immediately gives him a hard bump and says, "Welcome back t o the dirt, Sam." Sam Munroe slams right back into Linsky, closing the door on his attempted pass. Wow! These two old veterans are trading paint now like it's a demolition derby. Wow, that was a pure power move right there. The gloves are off, and we are in an old-fashioned street fight now. Cam Munroe around Linsky. Wow. The white flag is out. One lap to go. Wait a second, Cam Munroe slides in next to his dad trying to pass for the win. Sam Munroe holds on and takes the victory - in an incredible race! - Whoo! Sam's first race back in six years, and he looks like he hasn't lost a step. And here he is, ladies and gentlemen, your winner tonight, Sam "The Man" Munroe! Give him a round of applause, everyone! Yeah! That was one hell of a race, folks! Give it up for Sam Munroe! I wish I could've seen lead ass's face when you spun him out. I don't want to talk about it. Oh. Well, who put the buzz kill bee in your bonnet? Geez, you ought to be proud of yourself. That's some of the best racing you've done in years. Hey, Dad? I just want to say, good race. Did you get your tools from the garage? What? Did you get your tools from the garage? I'll come by tomorrow after work. Be sure you do that. Hey. How are you? Good. Sam, you okay? Cam, he's in there. I just don't know what to do about him. Don't worry. You just gotta give it some time. Yeah. Yeah. You guys will figure it out. Yeah. Would it help if I talked to him? Hell, I don't know. You all right with that? - Of course. - Well, if you are, I guess. - I'll give it a try. - All right. - I'll see you later. - Oh, my God. You. Hey. Cam, why are you doing this? - Doing what? - Driving for Linsky? You know, it's breaking your father's heart. Is it? You know it is. Well, hearts get broken now and then. That's why I've been after Dad to sell this monster. It's just been sitting here untouched for years. It's not doing anybody any good... but you know how stubborn he is. Like father, like son? Dad bought the car for Mom as a gift after he won his fifth championship. About a half hour after they left, it started raining pretty hard, and something happened. Dad lost control... and I lost my mom. Oh... Cam. And you keep racing. It's what Mom would've wanted. Racing's in our blood. Welcome back to Trading Paint. I'm your host, Sheriff Buck Taylor. Well, folks, we have a very special guest in the studio today. A man who stands third in points with five races yet to go. Our local legend, Sam "The Man" Munroe. Well, Sam, uh... I want to be the first to welcome you back. You haven't been on - the show in a while, have you? - No, I haven't, and I appreciate it. - Thanks for having me back. - All right. Well, I've got to ask you a question that's on the minds of all - the racing fans out there. - Well, all right. What is going on with you and your son, Cam? Well, nothing really. I mean, we just happen to be in the same race series, that's all. Yes, but it is unusual. No. No. Fathers and sons always, uh... race against each other. It's not unusual at all. True. But he is driving for your main rival. Now, look. My son is a hell of a driver. He ought to be, because I taught him everything he knows. But he wants to win, like all of the drivers do on the racetrack, including myself. So, I guess he decided to drive for someone else. He thought he might have a better chance of winning. Got you. Oh, we got a call coming in. - Hello, you're on the air. - Sam, I just wanna say I'm a big fan of yours and you'll always be the champ. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you. Will you do me a favor, please? Anything for a fan. Would you blow that loser, Bob Linsky, right off the track? Oh, she's feisty, ain't she? Well, why... why don't you consider it done. Now, I don't normally speak ill of the drivers. You guys have a dangerous job. But that Lead Foot Linsky, that's a total loser. The slimiest, back stabbing, son of a skunk who ever stole a car race. Well... I think you took the words right out of my mouth, ma'am. Uh... That gives you a free pass for speeding tickets. Oh, she's a pistol. She's a pistol. Well, listen, folks, you heard it first right here. He's gonna blow him off the track. Well, Buck, appreciate it. Good evening, and welcome to one of the biggest races of the year, the Ford 50. This super late model race is one of the tightest we've ever had with three racers vying for the top spot in this series championship. Hey, buddy. You know what? Your father is getting... a little bit too far ahead of me in the points thing. And, uh... it's just fucking points, you know, but... um, in the end it means a lot, so... what the hell am I gonna do about that? You asking me to intentionally wreck my dad? I'm not asking. You wanna win? Let's win. The super late model action is nonstop tonight with three laps to go in the main event. Its' been a family affair featuring a rough and tumble, back-and-forth battle between Sam Munroe and his son Cam. Sam leads with Cam knocking on his back door as they start to hit lapped traffic. Cam looking for an opening to pass, and his dad just keeps slamming the door. And there goes Cam Munroe on the inside. - He's really punching it hard. - Father and son, side by side. Neither man is willing to give. Both pulling out all the stops. This is what southern racing is all about right here. There's not an ounce of quit in either of these Munroe boys, but something's gotta give here with one lap to go! They are grinding hard down the back stretch, still neck and neck. And it looks like Cam is backing off now. Sam Munroe charges hard down the front stretch and takes the checkered flag! Wow. That win puts him way out in front of the points championship, with a comfortable lead over Bob Linsky. I guess this is the point where you tell me I'm fired. That would make sense. Actually, no. I kind of knew you'd never intentionally hurt your father. It was a bad call. I apologize. Let's load up the trucks and get the hell out of here. We've got a big day at work tomorrow. I'm sorry. You know what? I'm getting, I'm tired of both of them. - Father and son. - Hell, I'm your guy. Just give me the opportunity, buddy, I'll take their ass out. - Consider it done. - I live for it. I just wanna say I appreciate all of y'all coming out tonight, because this community means a lot of me. Now, I know some of y'all are concerned about me retiring, but I've been racing for 70 years, and I've worked hard at it, and I'll be 85 in a month from now, so I think I deserve a little retirement to spend more time hunting and fishing, and that's what I plan on doing. You know, you look like a little tensed tonight so I think I'll tell you an old folk's joke, since I'm an old folks. You know, this old man was sitting on the curb, and he was crying... I think you've had enough to drink tonight. Why don't you let Cindy take you home? Why don't you mind your own business? Now, come on. Let me take you out to the truck, and I'll tell Cindy you're waiting for her. I don't need your help. Now, come on. Everybody needs help. That's why you have family. That's why you have friends. Why don't you cut the crap, and let's just get out of here. - Come on. - What do you know about family, Pop? I mean, seriously, and I'm not talking about no Sunday dinners and birthday parties with Grandma. Do you have any idea what it's like to be me? My job is hanging by a thread, and I got a son of a bitch boss I can't even trust. That didn't have to be. Well, anyways, you're a winner now, finally again. That's exactly what you wanted. It's the way it should be. What the hell is that supposed to mean? What are you talking about? Dad, every day I look into Cindy's eyes, and I see it right there. She's losing faith in me, a little more every day. That is bullshit. How on earth would you know that? We never talked about nothing important. - Cam, that ain't true. - "Racing is everything. It solves all your problems." I've been listening to that stupid shit since I was a kid. Now, Cam, I never heard this before. You never complained about this before. Like I had a choice. You... Well, you do have a choice. It's your life now. No one can tell you how to run your life. Damn right! Not you, not Cindy, not my God damn boss. Calm down. You're working yourself up over nothing. Okay? Now, I've thought... You thought you raised me better, right? Ain't that what you always saying? Look, just let me do it my way. Stay out of my life. You got it? Right between the eyes. Good. ♪ Heaven came down The heaven came down ♪ - We gotta go. - What? I just had a fight with my father. - Oh, my God. What now? - Yes, fucking now. - We gotta go home. - Honey, you just, what is... I'm not talking about it. You just had a fight with him now? Oh, my God, when are you gonna grow up? Is this seriously gonna continue? Just leave. The action is fast and furious as Bob Linsky leads Cam Munroe, Dallas Cooper, and Sam Munroe in a spectacular main event. This has been an absolute dog fight here tonight. It looks like there's something going on right now with Jack Dunn in the number 57 car. Yeah. Jack Dunn seems to be slowing down and waiting for the leaders to catch up. What's he got up his sleeve? Whoa, Dunn just do-si-dos aside and lets Bob Linsky slip right by him. It's craziness out there. The super late model action is nonstop tonight. And look out! Jack Dunn and Cam Munroe get tangled up coming out of turn number four! Sam Munroe crashes into his son's car at full speed. Sam! Oh, no. It's a broadside hit from Cam Munroe. You hate to see anything like this happen in a race. Let's hope Cam Munroe is okay, folks. Oh, my God! I'm going out there! - Sam! - Cam! Cam! - Cam? - You okay, buddy? Cam! His visor! Get his visor open for God's sake! He can't breathe! Sam, we got him. We're just trying to help. - That's my fucking son. - We're just trying to help We're just trying to save his life, Sam. What you got? - Back up, please. - No, that's my son! - I understand. - Take the shade off! - Take the fucking shade off. - You gotta get back. - Sam, you gotta get back. - He can't breathe! How the fuck? He can't breathe! The car's on fire. We gotta get out. Got him. One, two, three, up. How's my son? Your son suffered different fractures to both of his legs. Will it affect his walking? With time he should make a full recovery. - When can we see him? - Not right now. All right. Well, you... you tell us when we can. Of course. Thank you. That's good news, really. Fractures, and he's tough. He'll get through that. Sam. - Thanks for watching Abby. - That's no problem. Are you gonna go see him again? - He really wants to see you. - I'm not so sure about that. Why would you say that? I don't know. Just all we've been through, and I think we might just be better... If what? You don't go see your son? He still loves you, you know? - He looks up to you. - Really? Yeah. You know something? We're lucky to have you. I think you're the only one keeping this family together. Promise me you'll go see him. I promise. - Hey, you. - Hey. - Can I come in? - Sure. - Got some magazines. - Thanks. - You can put them on the table. - All right. How you feeling? I am not feeling much of anything. Mm-hm. They got me on this morphine drip, and not being able to move is driving me fricking crazy. I know. But we gotta get you well. And I know you, you're just like me. You feeling a little better, you'll overdo it. So... don't do nothing stupid. - How are you? - All right. Listen, um... the other night at dinner... you said a few things that got me thinking, and, uh... I just want to say I'm sorry if I fucked up as a dad. I meant well. You don't need to apologize. It wasn't easy on either of us, losing Mom. But I still should've been there more for you... and I promise I will be from now on. - Don't you hate me? - Oh, son. - I could never hate you. - But I left you for Linsky. I don't care how many times you leave me, - I will always be there. - I gotta tell you something. After he didn't get into the main event, Linsky was scared of you gaining points on him. Mm-hm. He wanted me to crash you out of the race. That son of a bitch. Why didn't you tell me? I also didn't want to admit I was wrong and you were right. I'm sorry I fucked up. Let me tell you something. You are a good man. You're a good father, and you're a good husband, and that's all that matters. I want you to come back to me. We'll do it right this time. No half-ass measures. I want you in the racing seat. Who would be better to continue the Munroe racing legend than you? - Are you serious? - Damn straight. Hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. I guess we can salvage some of it. The block is cracked. Mm-hm. Dirty damn shame though, you coming so close. Yeah. I guess, that don't matter much now anyway, does it? Nope. Remember a few weeks back you spoke about your brother said something about some guy that was building a new late model? Yeah. Do you think that guy would be interested in selling? I don't know. But if he was willing to sell it, it would cost you a pretty penny. - Mm-hm. - Yeah. My brother, he said, uh, the guy always bought the best, so well, do you have a pretty penny? Mm. Sam, you can't... I'm sorry, sir. - I couldn't stop him. - That's okay, honey. I... I got it. Would you close the door? Yeah. So what do I owe this pleasure? Is the offer for the Mustang Boss still on the table? I remember a guy who said that he was never ever gonna sell that car, no matter what. It had some kind of sentimental value or... some God damn thing. So, why now? - I'm retiring from racing. - All right. That's it? Yeah, that's it. What do you want me to do? - Jump up and down. - I thought you'd be happy I'd be out of your way. Now there's no one that can stop you from winning - that sixth championship. - Oh, I'm happy as hell. Sam "The Man" Munroe is gonna retire from racing. Sure, that makes me very happy. Sounds good. Don't feel great. In fact, I'm kinda disappointed. - I don't understand. - Oh, yes you do, man. I want to win that championship, and I want to win it from you. I want to win it fair and square, right in front of all your adoring fans, okay? What's it gonna look like if I win the race and you ain't even in it? That's not my concern. My concern is my family. I feel awful, sorry for Cam and I'm... really sad for what happened, but that's racing. You wouldn't understand. Trust me. You don't give me much credit, do you? You know, maybe you oughta try me, because maybe I might have a little bit more brains than you give me credit for. A car and racing... doesn't mean nothing, when you got a child lying in a hospital bed. That's very touching. You don't believe me. As a matter of fact, I do believe you. You want to buy it or you don't? I'll send somebody over to pick it up. But don't bother. I'll drive it myself. Okay, everyone. Open your history book to chapter five. - James, sit down. - You gotta come check this out! - Class! Jacob! Madeline! - Oh, my God. Whoa. Look at all the smoke. Might want to get her washed. Hey, you. I just wanted to let you know that I'm going out of town, and I'll be back tomorrow late. I'm going to look at a race car. Because I have something to tell you, and I wanted to tell you in person. I think I'm in love with you. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. I'll see you tomorrow, then we'll talk about it. Drive safe. How y'all doing? - Good. - How are you? Good. I know you got here as quick as you could, but I got something in there that'd get you here quicker. You must be Stumpy. What gave me away? You must be Ben. Yes, sir. And that means you're Sam? - Sam. - Pleasure meeting you, Sam. - Nice to meet you. - Yes, sir. Well, boys... - let's take a look. - All right. Come on. So what do we got? Got a Rocket chassis, Clements race engine, Bert Transmission. It's got a Franklin rear end. It's got a C&R radiator. It's got Afco shocks. It's got Dave Smith 750 carburetor, the best one you can buy. You've got a sweet... steering rack, ButlerBuilt seats, Performance Friction brakes, Schoenfeld headers. I got it all. You got a big bunch of boxes. - How much is here? - I got everything it takes for y'all to complete this car. Well, would you take 80 cash? Damn, man. That's... That's hurting me a little bit. Uh... I gotta have what I put into it. Mm-hm. And, uh, I need at least 85. I ain't got 85. You like bikes? Yes, sir. I dabble. Well, how about this? Eighty cash and a trade. Well, that depends. What's the trade? Fully restored '51 Panhead motor. What are you doing? Are you crazy? - I can't let you do that. - I already done it. We got a deal? - '51 Panhead motor? - Yep. - Fully rebuilt? - Yeah. I'll bet my leg on it. That's a deal. Sam, it's a good deal. It's a good deal, Sam. - Appreciate it. - Thank you, Sam. - Good day. - So long, Ben. All right, Stumpy. Let's win some races! Stumpy, you are out of your mind. It's good to pay a long overdue debt. You don't owe me nothing. Hey, I wonder what Linsky will be thinking when he sees us pulling up to the track next season with this badass mother. God damn! Little more Sam, that's it. Oh, hey, hey, right there right there. I need me a beer. Oh. - Thank you, pretty woman. - You're welcome. You look like you could use one. Oh, thank you. Do you mind telling me what happened? No. I... I don't mind. Sam? - Mm? - You... You never told - her the story? - No, I did not. Well... have yourself a seat, and I'll... tell you the story about... how I got my nickname, and how Sam here saved my life. - Sam saved your life? - Yes, he did. Well, I ain't no beggar. I think sometimes he regrets it though. Was it a racing accident? I wish. Because of this leg, I never got my chance to race. What happened? It was, uh, the hottest day of the summer. The summer of '73 to be exact. Me and Sam, we decided to go down to our favorite fishing hole, and, uh, we were down there a couple of hours, but for some reason, the fish, they just weren't... weren't biting. I mean, no matter what we tried, bacon, worms, rooster tails. - Should've used hot dogs. - You and your damn hot dogs. - I'm just saying - I don't remember you catching any fish that day either. That's 'cause I didn't have any hot dogs. If you're finished making light of my lost leg, I'd like to get on with my story. Sorry. Go right ahead. I decided to go down the bank around 50 feet and try my luck. So, I... I cast my line in and waited for a few minutes. Nothing. So, I started to reel her in, and I got my... my line caught on a- snagged on a weeds or some... old tree trunk or something, and so I waded out, to try to get her unhooked, and that's when I found out why the fish weren't biting. Why? Gator. 12-foot, a hungry alligator. - It was more like eight foot. - Oh, my God. Hey. If it's a gator chewing off your leg, you can call it eight foot, all right? But it's my leg and it's my story, and that gator was 12-foot. - All right, all right, all right - Okay? I apologize, I made a mistake. It was 12-foot. - So... - Might have been 15-foot. - Twelve foot. - Or 20. Anyway. So that giant 12-foot alligator, he got a hold of my leg, and he started to drag me under. Well, I just figured I was a goner. But them Sam, he grabs both my arms. So, there I am stuck in a tug of war, Sam on one side, gator on the other. The next thing I remember, I was in the hospital. And that's when I found out that Sam here, he, uh... he tied his belt around what was left of my leg. He hauled me all the way up the road, flagged down a car, and took me to the emergency room. And I'm lucky to have Sam as a friend. - Ain't that right, Sam? - Yeah, lucky. - Yeah. - It ain't nothing, really. I... anybody ought have done it. Anybody would've done it? Yeah. Come on. Come on. You're my hero. - What are you doing here? - Abby's asleep. - What are you doing here? - He's inside. Sorry. Hey. How you feeling? You're getting old, Stumpy. You better watch your mouth, young man. I'm gonna kick your butt. Oh, yeah? With which leg? With the stump, then I could leave it in you. ♪ Oh, say can you see ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ At the twilight's last gleaming ♪ ♪ Whose broad stripes and bright stars ♪ ♪ Through the perilous fight... ♪ Good afternoon, and welcome to Champion's Race Weekend, here at the Talladega Hornet's Nest. - Good luck, and stay safe, okay? - Thank you. - You're all set. - Thanks, Pop. All right. Lemme help you out. Time to trade some paint. You ready? I sure am, Pop. I'm proud of you, son. Tonight we welcome the return of Cam Munroe, who six months ago was barely able to walk after a horrendous crash where he was hit by his father, Sam. This is the most important race of the year, folks, and you're gonna be track side. There's the rumble of 900 horsepower times 24, featuring the best super late model racers in the entire county. And here comes the green flag to start the action for the 16th annual Champion's Race. They take off with the thundering power so loud it's literally shaking my seat. A lot of history with Cam Munroe and Linsky. Some folks around these parts think Linsky orchestrated Cam's crash, and to say there's bad blood between the Munroes and Linsky, well, I say... That's an understatement for sure, as the racing action starts to get hot and heavy. Side by side, Munroe and Linsky come off turn two. They're going at it like a couple of prize fighters here tonight. It's a super tight race with Linsky holding onto the slimmest of leads. Two laps to go in an epic championship race. Bob Linsky and Cam Munroe letting it hang out tonight. Linsky dive bombs Munroe. Munroe spins towards the bottom of track. Linsky spins out Cam Munroe and keeps the lead. Wow. Cam Munroe is completely stalled out coming out of turn two. There's the yellow caution flag for the rest of the field. Cam Munroe needs to get his car started before Linsky makes it around to lap him, or he is disqualified. Linksy would love that. Unfortunately, time is running out for Cam Munroe as Linsky approaches. This will end it for him. Hang on! Cam Munroe's car fires up! He's got a chance here, folks! There goes Cam Munroe like a rocket! He's gotta get all the way around the track now to catch the rest of the field with only two laps to go. Cam is revving that car up to full speed, and he's gonna try to time it just right to slingshot into the pack as the green flag comes out. Here comes Cam Munroe like a bullet, slingshotting his way into the pack. He's flying, passing two or three cars at a time. Can he even get close to Linsky? Munroe slips by two more cars and now he's in second place! I've never seen anyone carve through heavy traffic like that. Dead even coming off turn number four and down the front straightaway. Is it possible for him to pull off a miracle? Checkered flag comes out. Only one lap to go. Linsky is in the lead. Everything on the line. Cam Munroe is storming after Bob Linsky. Munroe cuts inside, has the line! He has the line! He has the line! I love you. Whoo! Wow, what an incredible performance! Incredible. Congratulations on the victory, Cam. Thanks! Thank you. After the spinout, you charged through the rest of the field, and everyone here in the crowd was on their feet rooting for you. It was amazing. Well, I wish I could take all the credit for it, but, uh... I have to give a big shout out to my pop. I wouldn't be here without you. You're my hero. I love you. - I love you too. - Uh... When we lost Mom, you were my rock. I have had no one but you, so I love you. I love you, Pop. I love you too. And, um... to my beautiful wife, Cindy. Uh... Baby, I'm so truly blessed to have you by my side. Thank you. Let's all hear it for our winner, Cam Munroe! Hey! Yes! Did you make a wish? Subtitles by explosiveskull
