Couldn't you have told us? It's 200 kilometres away. Stupid bastard! This village... is it really abandoned? Sure is. No one there at all? No. How do you know about it? I just do. What'll happen with us? - We could surrender. - No way! We'll do 20 years in the clink. I won't go to jail. I haven't done anything. Do you think the cops will know the difference? Will figure out who did what? Just shut up! What we have to do, is get away. Go to that village. With what? The roads'll be blocked. On foot. 200 K on foot on foot? Are you nuts? Got a better idea? Fuck you, I'm splitting for Paris. Me too, I'll head for Paris. Off you go then, it's straight ahead. Just through there, you'll find a bus waiting for you. Really? There's a bus waiting for me?

Hurry up, get back! Shut up! Get in a line... Go on, line up! Hurry up! You come forward... Hurry up, damn it! How old are you, boy? 15 and a half, sir. Do you know how many people you've killed last night? You know? Four. You've killed 4 men last night. It was just in self-defense! Who are you to defend yourself by killing men? - Another man. - No, you're not a man. Neither you nor your friends. You're animals... wild beasts. Those men you killed... they were real men. Bastards. You look like a good boy. Why are you playing tough? What did you do, to get put there? I killed my father. He killed his father. But I'm dreaming. Just what is this bunch of cretins? You're dangerous maniacs, sick in the head! You should be put down! Let us go, sir. We didn't do anything wrong. You did nothing wrong? You killed four men! Four fathers with families. Honest working men. Is that nothing bad? It was them who started it. When someone slaps your cheek... ...you turn the other cheek. Were you never taught that? This guy's crazy! Forget it, Remi... Get the fucking cops! The cops? We don't need cops here! Here, it's just you lot, and me. Do you believe in God? Probably not. None of you believe in anything. Nothing! I do! I believe you're a nut-case! Take your clothes off, boy! Uh? Rene, go get the whip. That's not on! You too! Strip! Damn the lot of you! Lucien, bring the dog here. - But Dad.... - Bring it! So strip!

Hurry up. Get them off! Faster! You complaining? Hurry up! Hurry up! Not happy? Hurry up! So. What's going on? What are you doing? Stand up. Go on! Quickly! Stand up! You're not going to hit us. It won't bother me. You can't do that! Stop! Stop it! Who do you think you are, to do this? I am THE GOOD, and you are THE EVIL. And I'm the one with the whip. It's not right! Stop! Repeat after me... "Thou shalt not kill." Thou shalt not kill, OK? That's good. For you, son of Allah. "Thou shalt not steal." Allah is great and he damns you. He damns you, understand? Repeat what I said! Repeat it, Mehmet. Stop it, you motherfucker! "Thou shalt not steal." Good for you. And you... "Honour your father and your mother." Honour your father and your mother... Bastard! Don't do that! Stop it! Dad, that's enough! Get the cops! What do you think? That we'd let you loose on the countryside? All the time? You bandits! It's on fire! The sheep! Don't any of you move! Lucien, you take care of them. Bastards! Go and get some water, quick! Motherfucker! Put them up against the wall! -Listen! Listen! Search the place! Take blankets, and something to eat. Go on! Nothing. Not a signpost, not a road, nothing. Maybe it's better that way. We may be going in circles. How do you expect to find your village? Hey, what are the houses like? Well... Big. That's all? Yeah. You're sure that we won't be detected? No. No. You'll see. Lots of underground passages. We'll be able to hide. Once, they even found a guy in it. He'd killed ten women. They found him 50 years later. I'm not gonna waste 50 years underground. How will we get food? Well, we could hunt, eh? Yeah. Stop your bullshitting, you bunch of wankers! I'm fed up with your village. You don't even know how to get to it. Even if you get there, what are you gonna do? You'll be cold, hungry and scared. Day and night, all the time. So shut the fuck up about it! I'm not a killer. I've done nothing. I'm sick of the lot of you. I wanna get off! I wanna get off, damn it! Shut the fuck up! Bloody stop! Stop damn it! Calm down, Remi! Stop it! There's a chopper! Stop squabbling! Drive towards that forest, Christian! Watch out! You all-time super-fucking- -mega-idiot! I'll kill you! Shit!. I can't go any further. Hang in there, Sissi, we'll soon be there. Let go of me. I can't go on. I'm gonna wait here. Wait for what? Listen... There's nothing but wind here. I don't care. I like the wind. I like it here. You look beautiful. It's funny. Bernard... I can't remember what he looked like.. Come on... I'll carry you. - You'll never make it. - Yes I will. Stop, Milou. You're soaking wet. Take it off, I rub you, if you want. It's okay, I'll do it. No. Stop it! Let him go!. Stop it! You do this to me again and you'll never see me again. Where are you going? I'll see where we are. OK? Drop the gun. It's over now. Your hike is over. Go on, we'll go get the others. We are on the D21, heading towards Vareste. We'll be there in 20 minutes. OK, received. I'll send a motorcycle escort. Received. Over and out. I hope I don't stammer on TV. Keep calm and quiet, kids. Let me get through! Never! Give us the kids, and everything will be fine. Are you crazy? This isn't the Wild West. - Get out of my way! - We're not going anywhere! We want them, and we'll get them! Don't you move! Come out, Mehmet, come out. Stay where you are. Stay back! Stay back, I said! You can't get away with it! No! Stop! Stop! Get down, get down! Now, repeat after me... "I hope with all my heart that you'll get out of it." I hope with all my heart that you'll get out of it. I hope with all my heart that you'll get out of it. I hope with all my heart that you'll get out of it. Scram! Go on, fuck off! I'm going to throw up! No you won't, Maxime. You won't throw up! Get on my back! They'll set the dogs after us, won't they? No they won't. You sure? Sure I'm sure. Stop bugging me! What the fuck are you doing? We're coming. We'll never get make it. I knew we'd never make it. We'll make it, boyo! I swear we will. If you say that once more, I'll smash your face in! Otherwise, fuck off! We'll never make it, Christian. I tell you, we shall. - Is it still far, chief? - Don't call me that. Yes, chief. I'm sick of this, chief. - We're all sick of it. - But I'm really sick of it, chief. I'm sick of it! I can't take any more! - Shut up! - You want a broken nose? Put the stick down, Maxime. - I'll knock your block off! - Stop it, Max! Shut up, you bitch! - Shut up, Max! - No, I won't shut up! I'm sick of you! I'm sick of all of you! The whole fucking world... I'm sick of it! We're all gonna die! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I've had it! Come on, Mad Max. Come on. I'm so hungry! Me too. Isn't it daylight yet? We closed the shutters. It's freezing here. Is there really nothing to eat? Nothing. My stomach feels like there's a hole in it. Do like me... Eat. What is it? Curried chicken. Want some? - Oh, yeah! - There you are. Mmm... Delicious. - Who'd like a little wine? - Me, me! Me too. Of course, dear countess! Me too. Oh, my dear baron! If we just eat a little bit... We'll make it to your village, my friend. What did this guy do? Dunno, he ran off. What's that? What is it? An owl. Barn owl. Sounds yucky! It's harmless. No... Mummy. Mummy! What did he do? He's a thief. He steals everything. I killed my father. I... I was 12. Does the night last long. Yeah, it goes on all night. It'll be good in that village. It'll be peaceful. Leave her alone. That's best for her. Do you love her? Yeah. Stay away from her. I can't. I love her too. I'll kill you. Maybe you will. Listen to me. This is the police commander speaking. You can't get away from us. Surrender. I know you have weapons. Put them down and come down quietly. You will not be harmed. Come on, run! Quick! Run! Run! Catch them! No! Stop with the dogs! Stop with the dogs! Get away from me! Let me go! No!

It's desert here. You see an abandoned village? Tell me where it is! There are only stones here. Nothing but stones. Who would demolish an abandoned village here? Stop talking about it! Listen. We can hear you yelling 10 kilometers away. Did you drink that water? I did. I drank a little bit, ma'am. You'll get diarrhea. What's the matter with your friend? He injured his leg. What's that for? Nothing. Well, put it away before you hurt someone. Show me your leg. Do you ever wash? - Yes, ma'am. - I wonder when. - Do you like horses? - Yes Ma'am. So, take the reins. Follow me. Come on. Follow me. Leave it outside, my boy. No guns in my house. - We're hungry, ma'am. - Yes I know. You'll get to eat soon. In the meantime, go clean yourselves up. You smell like a herd of old goats.
