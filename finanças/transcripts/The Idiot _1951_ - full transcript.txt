Sounded more like you were dying Indeed I was on the verge of being shot I often have the same dream I was a war criminal, I was sentenced to be shot You're still alive At the last moment, they found they had the wrong man I was saved But the shock of it drove me crazy I was in an American hospital Down south? In Okinawa. But I'm better now I was released ten days ago. So what's wrong you? Idiocy They say it's a kind of epilepsy I had fits, then I became an idiot An idiot? Dostoevsky wanted to portray a genuinely good man Ironically, he chose an idiot for his hero But a truly good man may appear as an idiot to others This is the tragic story of the ruin of a pure and simple man Get up! This poor man is sick! There's no need... Have your seat back Accept kindness, idiot! Sorry, I didn't mean it. It's just a habit Don't worry. I don't mind That's a relief Are you cold? Yes, very cold You're some fellow! It had been many years since Akama had laughed Dominated by his father, he acted like a caged animal Strangely, he came to like Kameda, who made him laugh Akama told Kameda about Nasu Taeko One look at her released Akama's pent-up feelings Enchanted by the woman, Akama bought her a diamond ring... ... with his father's money His father, enraged by Akama's actions, disowned him But now, with his father dead, Akama is returning home Kameda is also traveling to Hokkaido, to see Ono, a relative Another snowstorm in Hokkaido Look, you just follow me That's her... Nasu Taeko Well? Don't you think she's beautiful? Very much so... But... But what? When I look at her, I feel pain inside Why's that? There's something about her... ...she seems so very unhappy What are you crying for? I don't know. Looking at this portrait... You really are an odd one You make me feel strange... ...as if I were looking at a newborn lamb I'll be heading off Be careful, the world's full of wolves Kameda saw Taeko and wept A woman of ill repute They said she'd been Tohata's concubine since childhood... ... and that now, Tohata has to pay 600,000 yen to get rid of her Unbeknownst to Kameda, her shadow now falls... ... upon his destination, Ono's house What are you going to do about Kameda? About Kameda? Well... The poor man is counting on our help I'll try to find him some sort of work Kayama has rooms for rent, so he can stay there Is that all? What do you mean? Well, your recent behaviour... My behaviour? You're being so secretive All those meetings... Tohata may have a lot of influence... ...but forcing his woman onto Kayama... That's enough! You know nothing! I'm glad not to know But any man who'd be so despicable isn't welcome here! - Yes, but... - I'll not discuss it... I want to talk to you about that idiot I'm against deceiving such a poor, simple man The army had reported Kameda officially dead... ... and so Ono had sold Kameda's inheritance... ... his father's 125-acre farm, through Kayama Kayama is now about to marry Nasu Taeko... ... in exchange for 600,000 yen But, Kayama is a weak man who cannot assert himself He would prefer to be with Ayako, Ono's younger daughter Good morning Sleep well? - Am I in the way - Not at all I was just listening to Kayama's views on life It's Taeko's birthday tomorrow. You haven't forgotten? - I know, sir - Very well Mr Tohata and I have talked her into... ...giving you her answer at the party You'd better be there I understand Knock first! Something I shouldn't hear? Mr Kameda, lunch is ready Ayako - headstrong, like her mother At times fastidious, at times mean What if all this were yours? - "If..." you say? - Would you be happy? Yes, of course - It may well be yours - I'm afraid I don't understand It's a beautiful sight! What's the matter? Why do you look at me like that? Somehow, I just can't believe that you're ill I wish I weren't But I am, aren't I? No, it's all right. I don't mind People laugh at me I'm strange without even trying What are you like? I want to know more about you What did you do before the war? Well... Rather not say? It's not that so much... I vividly remember the day I was reprieved Everything before that now seems unreal Tell me about it, then... How did it feel when you were facing certain death? The world, its people, everything... ...suddenly seemed very dear to me Everyone in the world? Each and every person I'd ever known... Everyone I'd ever passed by And not just the people... There was a dog I'd stoned as a child... I wondered why I couldn't have been kinder To the dog? Not just the dog... Kinder to everyone I thought that if I were ever pardoned and didn't have to die... ...I promised myself I'd be kinder and better... ...to everyone around me "It's no use," I thought... They really intended to shoot me The thought alone made me feel ill I sensed that I was losing my mind Where have you been? Mr Kayama is waiting to take you home Where did you get to? Don't ask. She's too stubborn, she won't tell And you be careful. She's not likely to mention it... ...but she's uncommonly proud of her looks That's why she's so headstrong And isn't that so typical of her? The haughty way she sits there, eyes like daggers Yes... quite striking I felt the same when I saw Nasu Taeko She's so beautiful Wherever did you run into Taeko? I saw her portrait in a photo studio window I must see it! Go on, tell me where. I'm too curious I'd like to see it, too Not me Really? I wish to see Mr Kayama Can you call him? He's in the study - Mother! - Sorry not to send the girls... ...but I have my reasons Madame summoned me? What for? Do you have any idea? I mentioned Nasu Taeko, and then... What? Do you know her? But how? You obviously overheard Ono and I, then passed on your gossip No, I just... Why did you do that? I only mentioned the picture at the station Well it can't be helped. Let's go Look, I need you to do me a big favour Give Miss Ayako a letter for me Is it a bother? No. But why don't you do it yourself? You can see her any time No, I can't. I have good reason not to I don't want anyone else to see it Besides, it's rather urgent Mother's in the parlour Mr Kameda, let's go upstairs He asked me to give this to you I am inclined to be somewhat outspoken Don't be offended, but I cannot abide dishonesty We've been like relatives... ...so I'll speak to you like a mother Do you intend to marry soon? Not at all. Rather... No... No? Are you quite sure about that? Well, I... You'd rather not say? I must admit, when there's so much secrecy over a betrothal... ...it does make one wonder That's all I wanted to say Now if you'll excuse me I just got a real roasting because of you - But I... - No excuses! Did she respond to my letter? Mr Kameda, please We can go back together. I'll wait outside Go on, read this Isn't that Mr Kayama's letter? Yes, now read it. Read it aloud to me You gave it to me "Tomorrow will decide my fate "You need say but a single word... "...if you still feel as you once did towards me "Tell me to cancel my marriage... "...and I will gladly do so" He's about to marry, seduced by power and 600,000 yen A contemptible marriage Now he wants me to tell him to cancel it He wants to trade my friendship for 600,000 yen! If he'd had the fortitude to refuse... ...I might well have agreed to it But no. Give it back to him Tell him I said friendship cannot be bargained for Friendship is not for trading That's my response to him Her answer? Didn't you give it to her? Yes, I did. Then she asked me to read it You read it? She said to give it you back She herself told you to read it? Are you sure? Yes, but I didn't want to What an idiot! She'd never ask you to do any such thing But she did. I have her answer, too Which is? "Friendship is not for bargaining" That's what she said to tell you "Friendship is not to be bargained" KAYAMA INN & LODG INGS Not again Telling your tales here, too. It's disgraceful - Any disgrace is yours - Takako, don't Apologize to Mr Kameda It's your behaviour that worries me So he told you everything, did he? Don't be silly. He's only this minute come in All this talk about everything being settled tonight Who but Kameda would blab about that? It was me Your sister's right But why? Why her? Why marry another man's concubine? She and Tohata are not my concern It's you I'm worried about I want to know exactly why you're marrying Taeko That's easy - He hates being poor - That's enough... I can't stand it anymore. You're detestable I dare you to repeat that I shall. Any number of times You're detestable, and so is she If you bring that woman here, I shall leave home If that's your wish Don't think it ends here. There's more I wrote and told her everything I've just told you You bitch! You look like you've just seen a ghost Go and announce me Wait. Who will you say is here? Such a strange fellow Nasu Taeko How do you know me? Well, I... Never mind that. Just announce me And marry her, I will It's worth it to spite you Miss Nasu is here I let myself in before I froze in your hallway Why on earth do you look so surprised? Introduce me My younger sister. Nasu Taeko My mother. Miss Nasu Taeko How do you do. I'm glad you came Are you really? Then, I'm quite the fool, aren't I? I thought perhaps I may not be welcome... ...in such palatial premises as these I don't see... - Mother, a word - Go make some tea May I also sit down? Please do Don't be a nuisance, Dad. We have visitors My father. Miss Nasu Taeko Kayama Jumpei is the name... ...a pitifully wronged former soldier Fifty years old, with nothing but failure to show for it This is Mr Kameda, he's such an interesting fellow A relative of Mr Ono's Sorry, I treated you like a servant Well, I... But still, how did you know of me? And why did you look so surprised upon seeing me? I felt as if somewhere... ...I'd seen your eyes before So it is true Where's my rival? What are you doing here? Who are you men? Never! This pup? Who are you? Akama Denkichi, with a pocketful of money I'll buy and sell the likes of you Get out of here You'd actually marry this fellow? I remember you Long ago, you gave me a diamond ring But why do you question me now? How do our marriage plans concern you? I'll pay 600,000 yen if you give her up What are you raving about? You're drunk 700,000 yen! 800,000 Idiot! Leave, or I'll call the police One million yen. By tonight Arrange for one million tonight So suddenly my price has shot up by 400,000 yen? - Scum! - Father! He's made you look even more foolish Shut up! I will not. It's too sordid and shameful Either you remove her, or I shall Damn you! That's enough Don't meddle! Let me go! Stupid brother! It's all right. I don't mind Not at all You've no shame. The man is a lamb It's nothing Nothing at all Nothing That's not the real you That's not who you are Everything she said about me is true Can you forgive me? Mr Kayama, I shall see you tonight I expect you, too, Mr Kameda The hostess ignoring her guests? What's the matter? You look pale Do you have a fever? Do you think that's why I'm here? Why not rest a while? There's something I must tell you You're very kind, but I prefer to keep drinking Whatever is the matter? Enjoy yourselves Mr Kameda has arrived Kameda? Not him again? He ran into Taeko at my place You were supposed to escort him here Show him in Why him, of all people? Because he's an idiot? I hardly think so He may even be somewhat cleverer than you At least in understanding human feelings - I knew it - The nerve of you It just happened... Do you know what that's worth? I have one question. Didn't you give that vase to me? Then let me do as I wish I fully intended to break them, in any case I won't bother with introductions There's no-one here worthy of it What a remark Fortunately, though, we've already met What's wrong? Why do you stare at her like that? I wonder, too. Is anything the matter? It just occurred to me... I was sure I'd seen eyes like yours before I just remembered where Eyes like mine? Why is it I couldn't remember? What was the person like? Another who was sentenced to die, like me There were three firing posts... ...where they executed three men at a time I was at the rear of two rows of prisoners Minutes away from death I never even dreamed that I would get a reprieve I felt sure it was my time to die And the man? The one with eyes like mine? He was in the first group to be shot He was barely twenty years old He had the face of a boy Tied to the post, he seemed to be in a trance Then suddenly, he began to tremble He looked across at us as if voicing a complaint The eyes of a man who had undergone torment and suffering... ...for a very long time Those eyes seemed to ask... "Why must I endure such pain as this?" He suffered terribly His eyes seemed about ready to burst and spurt blood For a moment I forgot I was about to be shot, too I turned my eyes away At times... ...your eyes are almost exactly like that boy's What next? What happened to him? The next thing, I heard shots ring out I turned to look at him... ...and there he was, limp like a rag Enough! It's far too gruesome a story This is supposed to be a birthday party Stop it, please My birthday means nothing to you, does it? Mr Kameda... Frankly... They say I'm to marry Mr Kayama I'm supposed to give him my answer tonight Should I accept or not? - Taeko! - This is most improper I'll do whatever you say It's absurd Please, Mr Kameda, tell me Taeko, why ask him? What is he to you? Don't you understand? He trusted me the first time he laid eyes on me What else can I do but return that trust? So, tell me. Please advise me what I should do You should not marry him Then I won't Did you hear that, Mr Kayama? That's my answer to you That's ridiculous What about the promise you made just days ago? Tohata, what's the meaning of this? Oh, I see. Now you're satisfied, are you? What? It's obvious you're loathe to part with your treasure I'm the dupe, here You? It's me who's been duped It's all your doing Friends shouldn't fight Mr Ono, Mr Kayama... ...don't try to blame Mr Tohata I shall never go back to him What a face! You needn't pay one yen to be free of me So you can put away your 600,000 yen I'll return the house to you, and give back every single item Taeko! I'm leaving with only what I'm wearing No, Taeko I was wrong. I've been such a fool It's too late I'm no longer the fourteen year old girl you procured Listen to me. I swear to you... I don't care what the world thinks I'll marry you How conceited to even consider I'd marry you Who are you? What is this? A million yen You kept your promise? Thank you He'll pay a million yen for me That's 400,000 more than you I'm through with this As of tomorrow I'm penniless No man would accept another's castoff... ...without a penny to her name Right, Kayama? I thought Kameda was your oracle If it were up to me, I would take care of you What did you just say? I said, if it were up to me, I'd take you in A woman like me? The way I am? Yes. Of course But what do you mean, "A woman like me?" I don't understand Why do you laugh? Did I say it in a funny way? All I wanted to say was... ...Miss Nasu is very chaste That's enough, you idiot! How dare you mock me? I really am a sick man. My brain is rotten I may have said something odd But I honestly tried to express how I feel about you I don't care if the world laughs at me I do think you're chaste You just said you'd leave, taking nothing with you That's fine with me And I'll let no one speak ill of you So why feel ashamed? Why sell yourself to a man like him for a grubby million yen? - Stop interfering - Let me speak You have suffered too much on your own To the point where you feel bad when you're not in pain You really are ill You need a kind nurse I'll become your nurse and take good care of you How do you expect to support a high living woman like her? You're a pauper I'll find work, somehow What work? Shoveling snow? I doubt he'd make 300 yen at that Not even enough to buy her cosmetics That's enough. Stop making fun of him Thank you No one has ever said anything like that to me before Miss Taeko... I think... ...somehow it'll work out When I first saw your picture... ...you seemed to be calling me As a matter of fact... ...I've long waited for a man like you Even while enduring this life, I have waited I'd sit and think I formed a mental image of a man like you I prayed a good, honest and kind man would finally appear "Taeko, it's not your fault "I deeply respect you" I truly hoped he'd phrase it along those lines But then, as always, Tohata would come for me He'd use me, deprave me, then go away You'll never know how much I hated it I'd rather fall dead... ...in the streets than continue with this life But... I'm afraid your offer... ...is out of the question Everyone, I have an announcement No, it's more of a confession As a man, I'm despicable, utterly and completely I hid from everyone the fact... ...that Mr Kameda actually has a fortune As his relative, I believed it in his best interest Anyway, I wish to announce... ...that Kameda is the owner of a 125-acre farm Back off! You really mean what you said about her? It's only a joke What? So you and I...? It's clear, isn't it? I'll go with you But why? Surely not this crude fellow? Get lost! Listen... I could never ruin the life of one so innocent as you You forgot something, the million yen It was tough to raise this much Keep your distance! I give it to Mr Kayama Remove it with your bare hands, and it's yours It's burning! A million yen going up in flames It's such a waste Be quiet. Let me go! Mr Kayama, don't just stand there Hurry, or it'll be gone! Mr Kayama, what's the matter? Don't you want it now? You little worm. Take a good look That's how we do things Don't pretend. Be yourself Or you'll regret it Pull it out, for God's sake. What's a little pride? Hurry! It's all burning! The fire... It's safe. It's almost all intact Only a few thousand yen got burned Stand aside Listen, everybody... ...it's all for Mr Kayama He watched it. He would have let it burn It's his by right Is that clear? With that, farewell to you all Farewell, Mr Kameda Come, men! Let's go drink! Don't go, Kameda! There's no saving such a woman Kameda! February Ayako, don't play with your food Why are you all so quiet? Something's going on around here It's the weather, no sun for weeks Everybody gets depressed It's not that, I know. It's that man, isn't it? I really misjudged him Why give him money to squander on that woman? But... And the way you did it displeases me Wasn't there a better way? Why involve Mr Karube? And you, acting so secretively, as if you were the guilty one! And Kameda didn't even have the grace to thank you Perhaps he is an idiot? What's so funny? But... Again? Is that all you can ever say, girl? But, Ayako... What's she's up to this time? Such young ladies Tell me. What is it? He sent her an odd letter An odd letter? When? A week ago. Kayama's brother passed it on That school boy? Kameda used a schoolboy? But Kameda is in Tokyo. How could he? He sent it from there So? What was in the letter? "Frankly, I have no idea why I'm writing to you like this... "But I simply cannot suppress the hope that... ...perhaps you sometimes entertain thoughts about me "For reasons I find it difficult to explain... "...you are very important to me "I've nothing else to say or write about myself "I wish you happiness, Kameda" What's so funny? It's the letter, isn't it? Do you know why? It's because Kameda never lies. He's totally honest That's stopped you laughing, hasn't it? Well, well. You lost that one, didn't you? But why did he send it? Have you heard anything more about those three? Evidently he's still chasing Taeko, just like Akama is And Taeko, too... ...she swings like a pendulum between them She once said she'd marry Akama but then ran away with Kameda It's bound to blow up - Forget something? - No, but I... ...I felt someone looking Like what, a murder or something? Akama's not above murder Stop, it's far too morbid Come on in Come as you are Watch your step here What's wrong? Stop staring at me like that Sit down Akama, I want you to tell me the truth Was that you at the station? I'm not admitting anything A pair of eyes in the crowd were exactly like yours Whose eyes? Or did I just imagine it? Sometimes I have hallucinations This room is dark, huh? It's an old house When I was 100 yards from here, I knew this was your place How? Intuition, I had a feeling your house would be just like this So very dark You have a forbiddingly dark aura about yourself, too You'll live here after you marry? Of course. It's my home When is the wedding? You know I can't decide such a thing on my own Please, I wish you'd tell me the truth I'm not trying to meddle or anything But she's here, in this house, isn't she? You've both decided, haven't you? What if we did? Is that why you're here? Not really But I really think it's best if the two of you don't marry I've said it before Marriage would be the ruin of both of you There's nothing I can do to stop you But you understand, don't you? I can only feel sorry for her Everything she does worries me I can't just watch We talked about this before, didn't we? I ask only for her happiness, nothing more Why scowl at me? I'll go back now Goodbye Stay. It's been quite a while The minute you leave, I know I'll start hating you again You made me boil for a month after we parted in Tokyo I could've killed you It's true But face to face with you, I soon forget my anger And oddly enough, I like you as much as ever You're different. We're totally opposite types Have a drink Now listen, you love her because you feel sorry for her I hate her as much as I love her I think it'd be easier if she were dead She hates me anyway I gave her a beating for hurting my feelings No. Surely not? Yes, I did I sat outside her door for two days without eating or drinking The maid developed a fear of me That upset Taeko and she came outside Know what she said? "What would you do if I never forgave you?" I said I was ready to die, if need be Then she wondered aloud if I wouldn't kill her first When I saw her again about a week ago, she told me... ...she'd made up her mind She said she was an outcast, anyway, so she'd do as I told her But she wanted a little more freedom Until she was satisfied she'd had freedom enough What do you think? I don't understand it at all Are you sure? Shall I clarify things? She's in love with another man... ...and that man is you The hand of fate She can never marry you Why? Because it would ruin you So she's decided to ruin herself with me! What a thing to say You're only imagining things You're just jealous That's enough I wish I hadn't come... ...if my visit causes you so much pain Something told me not to come But I was hoping for a more favourable parting I only wanted pleasant memories You use that for cutting paper? Yes But it's not a paper knife, is it? It's a meat knife But I can cut what I like with it I suppose you can It strikes me as being very new, though You think I can't afford new things? You're right, what am I saying? When my head starts to get heavy... ...I sometimes say and do things I don't mean It's been getting worse lately Perhaps it's a sign of an approaching fit Well, farewell. I wish you luck Take care. I'll walk you out What's that? My mother. She's praying to the ancestors And you? Do you ever pray? What I mean is, do you believe in a God? Do I believe... Not especially I was made to pray as a child With a mother like that, I always carried a charm I still do, in my wallet I carry a sort of charm, too. It's just a plain stone Worthless to anyone else, but it has great meaning for me I told you, right? The shock of being pardoned just before execution... ...drove me insane It was then and there I picked up the stone It's still precious to me You have it now? Show it to me - Can I keep it? - Why? What for? I don't know. I'd just like to have it I'll trade you my charm for it A charm swap? I remember I used to do that with friends as a boy Let's have tea with Mum Mum, this is Kameda, he's an old friend of mine Make us some tea Make the tea Just relax She doesn't know a thing She doesn't even know I'm a lout Right, Mother? She likes you. She'll share the cake offering Eat it to please her No need to shake hands We've exchanged charms There's nothing else for it. Taeko is yours You have her. Think of me sometimes What did I see? What was it that shone? END OF PART ONE PART TWO: LOVE AND LOATHING Well, it's the naughty boy That doesn't appear to offend you Mailman, messenger boy, runner. What else are you? No answer means you know very well that it's wrong to deliver improper letters Your attempt today was rather clever Stop wasting my time Tell me, where is Mr Kameda hospitalised? He was released Can fits be cured so quickly? Are you disappointed? Nice try, but you'll not get even that way What a fool I've been. I needn't have rushed here Then go home That's enough. I'll do as I please You're such an ungrateful fellow, aren't you? Quiet, please. He's a sick man I know that. I'm letting him off easy In regards to the farm... ...why send this wretch over like a debt collector? What did you do, Mr Karube? Well, you see... You have a right to what's yours A right? Just what did you do? I'll be blowed. You really don't know? May I ask who is paying for all your expenses? This may sound quite forward of me... ...but Mr Ono said I owned the rights to a large farm Mr Karube said he'd advance money for it on good faith I don't wonder! He forced us to pay, and said it was your insistence You're both at fault, but Karube is despicable Don't run off. I plan to take action Please, don't I meant to settle things properly. I really did Bilk one yen from him, and you'll settle from a jail cell You, too. Outside I have to have words with Mr Kameda You really are something No, I'll not say more One look at you and the words melt away I'm not being sarcastic Forgive me... ...but your tolerance strikes me as being almost cynical What do I mean to say? What have I been talking about? I remember. It's time I asked after you So, how are you? Much better But you'd better be careful. You're quite pale Still on your own? Do you have a wife? - No, I don't - Forget the smile... ...I was a being a tad sarcastic But there's one thing I must ask you What is it? I read your letter to Ayako What did you mean? It really was such a fine day when I wrote it Forget the weather On a bright sunny day like that... ...man becomes filled with hope What hope? Surely not Ayako? Are you in love with her? - No... - Are you sure? Perhaps... See? It's all quite clear But what about Ayako? From her, there's more abuse than praise She calls you an invalid and an idiot Don't be offended, though She's my child to the core, willful with a touch of craziness She'll criticize or tease anyone she happens to like But don't hold out any false hopes about her It's a constant worry having grown-up daughters Did you hear about Kayama? No. What about him? He has designs on Ayako, too He regained her trust after that stunt with the money He ended up giving it back to Taeko. It established his credit Be that as it may... Oh, yes, I think I'd better go warn him, too Take care By the way, I'd rather you didn't visit Especially on a fine day You get my drift? Yes, of course Ayako forbade me to visit even before you mentioned it What? When? She wrote to me while I was in Tokyo That messenger boy? - What messenger boy? - Never mind What did she write? "There is no hope "I have no wish to ever see you again" That's the thrust of it Knowing her, there is hope, and she does want to see you I'll get to the bottom of it, I will Leaving already, Mrs Ono? Is your family well? Won't you stay for tea? It's cold What did Mrs Ono say to you in the hallway? Whatever it was, it made you red in the face Don't ask, then What makes you like this? Still carrying a grudge? Regarding this matter, I'm on your side What matter? Still avoiding it? Didn't she warn you about Ayako? It makes me so mad. Does she think we're beneath her? I'm only their employee Mere words But this won't do. Get a grip on yourself Ayako is just shy Being so unpredictable is a device to conceal her real self - From Kameda's room? - Yes Kaoru's busy fixing his ice carnival costume He's happy enough Be careful. Mrs Ono gave him a warning, too She was in a big hurry, too. Something's afoot - They're all crazy - Mother... Ayako, who are you looking for? Don't fret, it's too cold for that invalid to be out Who's that fool? He's a clown Messenger boy! I hope he falls over Be careful! You're both making a fool of me You too, Ayako. You're making fun of your mother Tell me what you're up to What did that boy tell you? Good evening. I looked all over for you Good evening. Kaoru said that you're here Let's go over there I'm cold from standing in one place What a liar It's hideous. What were they thinking? I'm going. I've had enough of this nonsense Just as I expected Why do you stare at me? Can't you greet me? Let's go over there See you at home. Kayama will take me home So you came? Don't be overly proud. You have no right to Did you forget what you were willing to do for 600,000 yen? Is that her? I want you to meet me here at noon tomorrow Come with me. How dare she insult us? Come, Noriko Too bad. This is no place for you, is it? Don't tell me you're not angry after what I did to you We traded charms, of course I trust you I'm no good Did you know Taeko wants you to marry Ayako? What do I care? She wants you to be happy. That means she loves you Are you asleep? You actually fell asleep? It's you, is it? I must have dozed off Didn't someone else try to wake me? I thought another woman came I must have dreamed it. Yes, a dream By "another woman," do you mean her? What did you dream about her? All right! I don't want to know But can you explain why you fell asleep? Look How silly it looks It looked so grand last night Why on earth did I come here? You made me promise to meet you here I have little use for men who fall asleep But I didn't get to sleep all night Mr Kayama almost committed suicide - Wasn't he just pretending? - It's possible In that case, I'll go easy on you Come on, let's hurry Do you know why I asked you to meet me here? It's because I can't stand to hear them laughing at you You're a bit... I'll be frank... At times your illness makes you seem old But you have a greater wisdom than most people And that's what's important There are two kinds of wisdom, the important and the unimportant But few people realize that No, actually Mother knows. Me, too, but we're special I've waited a long time for a chance to tell you this You sent me that letter, remember? Ever since then, no, even before that But you chased her! That woman! Did you come back because of her? I detest you! I love Mr Kayama - You lie - No, it's true! Ask this bench. We often meet here - Another lie - Think as you like Anyway, he's changed completely To prove it, he cut off his finger before my eyes Which hand? What's the difference? He cut it off! His fingers appeared intact last night Tell me the truth You're crazy about Taeko, aren't you? Yes. But not in the way you think How do you know? I'll say it again... I don't really know how I feel about her I thought you wouldn't understand What would you do? If a beloved friend of yours were... ...chained in a cage and brutally beaten with a stick? Filled with sorrow... ...you'd rather be beaten yourself, right? Whenever I see her, she spurs that feeling in me Maybe you can't understand But I do You only know she was once concubine to another man And that she suffered a great deal as a child But they are not her only problems When someone takes a piece of candy from a sensitive child... ...he gets upset and throws away all the candy She's like that If she weren't... The thought drives me mad She was badly hurt once Because of that, she unconsciously tries to ruin her life I just can't stand it! Why? Don't you know that she wrote to me three times? Letters? Here's one She advises me to marry you She harps on about it, flattering me, provoking me Last night, too Mr Kayama was in the way, and look how she responded! The nerve of that woman! Try to forgive her. As I said before... No, I can't think as you do. It's all here, in her letter! She wants to see you happy That's a stupid, sentimental act And if not, it's jealousy, or even worse She's actually dividing us, not uniting us! - You can't think that - I certainly do You certainly what? But Ayako asked me to meet her there I got there at noon, then I fell asleep You what? I fell asleep while waiting Well, I never! How do you feel about Ayako? About Ayako? Well, do you like her, or what? I like her a lot Then, how you could sleep is beyond me No, don't bother to explain But assure me of one thing Did anything occur which might make a mother worry? I don't think so Then don't meet her outside. Ayako catches cold easily When you visit her, do it properly Come calling on her at home You certainly are a strange fellow With no warning... ...you pay us a visit in a blizzard And you never fail to surprise us In March, a blue sky shows behind the clouds Occasionally there's thunder That's just the way you are I can't stand it You sat with her like this when you went away on that trip And you talked of me? Leave now! Go home Never come back! I'm a bottled future bride I sit like this, as if I were on display in a bottle From bottle to bride I hate it Listen, let's go away together Why do you come every day? Don't you realize everyone's laughing? I'm sick of seeing you every single day I was very cruel to you, wasn't I? Will you remember and make me suffer for it? Sometime in the future Another letter from her. The nerve of that woman She says she'll also marry when we do What is it? You look pale Inconvenient for you? Don't worry. I'll never marry you... ever Why do you all laugh at him? Is Mr Kameda giving me carnations so funny? - No one's laughing - Liar! You put them in front of me on purpose... ...then looked at Mr Kayama and smiled You always put flowers in the centre Don't fuss, dear. It's not important It's important to me! Mr Kameda is much finer... ...far more decent... ...and purer than any of us But in spite of that, you all make fun of him And of me - Are you crying? - No, absolutely not But why is bringing me carnations so funny? Well, they are red. It's absurd Why's that? Don't you know? Red carnations mean... Right, Mr Kayama? Then I'll ask him Tell me clearly. Why is it so funny? I don't know. Maybe it's because red means love I didn't know that. I just thought... Enough! Even if Kameda sent them, knowing they signify love... ...it would hardly be a joke to me I'd accept them gratefully Ayako, please Who cares? Foreign customs don't apply in Japan But what if they did? He just got through saying he didn't know that Isn't that right? Yes. But it's true that I love her What does that mean? Is that a proposal? Surely not! I want... ...to marry her But still... Right, Satoko? I reject the proposal. Absolutely I'd like to speak with him in private We certainly didn't anticipate it. How did it end up like this? Father, Mother wants to see you Think it over, you understand? Look at her. The poor child But still... We have no choice but to let her decide for herself Yes, but why him? Still, deep in my heart... ...I somehow feel she's made the proper choice You mustn't look Don't look at my face But what a face it is I beg your pardon? It's reflected in the window I think I know why you seem so sad... You mustn't say it But it needs to be said The way it is, a certain person stands between us Don't speak of it Please stand up Are you happy? That's all I need to know Did she make you happy? What did she say to you? I understand. I'm so glad But this must be our last meeting, isn't that right? Farewell We're leaving tomorrow. Probably never see you again So why didn't you answer her question? Well? Are you happy? So that's it? You have no answer A rare visitor is here... Miss Ayako Not for you, though. And I don't wonder why Last night you seemed pleased about their engagement She's visiting Kameda? Need you ask? Of course she is They went out together in this storm. It's maddening Do you have the courage? I do. But I'm still worried No, you needn't worry All I want is to understand her motives Last night, I thought it over, and finally it came to me If I talk to her, it'll clear everything up I may even come to like her Is she here? Yes, she is But still... Frightened of a mere girl? Yes, I am I'm afraid to even look at her She's the sum of all my dreams come true She has... ...everything that I've ever lost To me... ...she represents an ideal So that's why... ...I wrote to her Through her, I wish to make my dreams come true But... But if you get a look at her, you may not like her Please, let's not do it. I really am afraid What a face. What's wrong? You're pale, too But... this is important for us This time I won't be impetuous You are, of course, fully aware... ...of why I asked to see you? No, I'm afraid not Yes, you do What good would it do me to pretend? Never mind, then But you're under the wrong impression... I haven't come to quarrel with you But I'm not the sort to let things pass unnoticed I came to give you an answer to your letter But before that, I have a question Do you have any idea what sort of person Mr Kameda is? I certainly do. Far better than you You're lying. You couldn't possibly know Why not? Why not? Because you only ever think of yourself You are so self-absorbed, you don't even think of others If you really understood Kameda... ...you wouldn't subject him to such ridicule Since when have I subjected him to ridicule? Why did you walk out on him? He's simple and naive. Why did you deceive him? Ayako, please Look at him Even now he's trying to shield you I've never met a kinder man with a purer heart That's why I love him with all my heart Is that all you came to say? No. One more important thing My response to your annoying letter I'll speak frankly You have no right to interfere with us Don't stand between us A martyr at our expense You act as though you're some sort of tragic heroine You mustn't say that You were right, she is not as I thought Why was I such a fool? For some reason I imagined... ...this jealous young lady to be an angel Listen to me You yourself, don't even know why you came today, right? Shall I tell you why? You wanted to see what it is you're afraid of - Afraid? Afraid of what? - Me, what else? You're worried sick that maybe he loves me more That's why you're here You're wrong. He only pities you, it's not love But it amounts to the same thing I realized I don't have the right to accept his love That's why I... Enough Take your precious man and go! I can't bear to look Understand this. It's you who makes him suffer Hurry and take him Take him and get out. Go now! No, I've changed my mind We'll have a showdown I shall command him Then he'll abandon you and stay with me forever He'll marry me And you'll go home sobbing in misery Is that what you want? Is it? Mr Kameda, which of us will you choose? I'll never let you go again - Say you'll marry me - No, not that Ready? If he fails to take my hand, or if he stands by you... That way he'll be yours, and I'll have no need of him Now, then, which of us is it? How did it come to this? Please, please. I don't want you to blame her She is just a poor, ill-fated woman Will you go for her? Is she the one? Hey! I'll take over here You go find Ayako Ayako's not home How could you take her there and not bring her home? It's Ayako She's back, but she has a raging fever And the phone's dead Good. I'll go right up Understand this... ...it's all over. We've had quite enough of you AKAMA RESIDENCE Come with me. We need to talk Is she at your place? Yes, she is Did you peek out at me? Is she still here? Stop it. I told you, didn't I? I'm not supposed to be here It's very cold. Won't you light the stove? No, I can't Why not? I felt I had to see you Really? I guessed as much I suspected that was it, so I came looking for you I've been thinking about you I thought I'd get you here so we could talk tonight Is she sleeping in there? Yes, she is Want to look? But... Never mind. Come in It's very dark We can see You're trembling. Careful you don't throw a fit Oh no... You did it? Yes, I did What do you intend to do now? The way you tremble! Don't push me! You and I will stay here tonight It's hot. It's really hot, isn't it? What? Aren't you cold? Listen, someone's coming! I don't hear anything See? She's sleeping there She's not going anywhere She's all ours now We'll never give her up, will we? Let's take turns watching She has such a beautiful body Take a look in the morning I stayed with her all day I've never seen anyone so beautiful But I'm worried she may smell The heat from the stove does it You smell it? I don't think so I wish we had flowers to offer I can't take any from my family altar Mum would notice Maybe buy some? We should bury her in flowers Come to think of it, that'd be too pathetic Listen... There's one thing I'd really like to know How did you kill her? Did you use that knife? You know, the meat knife Wait. Wait a minute I've a few things to ask you... Tell me everything First of all, I left here, right? Did you do it then? Right after. The knife was on the table But it's strange The knife went in three inches. No, even deeper About here But scarcely any blood came out You know why? I can explain it Internal bleeding Listen Hear something? Yes! Footsteps Hear them? - Somebody's outside - I hear it Someone walking Yes, walking Look! Wonderful! Look at that cloud! It's like a rainbow It shines so oddly It's coming. It's coming here Rushing this way And she's astride it She's laughing My Mum, too They're here Hurry, get on! Someone, quickly! Such thunder. Even the weather's gone crazy I hate having to visit the infirm Ayako, do something for him. He's so upset I told him not to come A silly schoolboy. Maybe he's an idiot, too Kaoru, you come with me Poor thing, I feel ever so sorry for him No matter what anyone says, he was a fine person There aren't many like him around And that worthless Karube came bringing flowers The man had tears in his eyes I don't want to talk about it I promised I'd watch him carefully... ...then tell you what he did But I can't Is it so bad? Don't worry All I know is he was such a nice man If we could only love people the way he did... ...without any hate What a fool I've been I was the idiot THE END
