[Film projector sound with distinctive music] [Positive piano and strings jingle music with glittering sounds] [Authentic eastern music fades in] [Foreign female vocalizing] [Music fades] - A letter from Egypt. - From Egypt? - A letter from Jordan. - Thank you! Hey! You there! Me? - No, you! - Me? Yes. - Aren't you abu raji's son? - Yes. There's a letter from Germany. [Banging at the door] Amal, see who's at the door. Guess what I have? A voucher for an extra sack of flour? No. I bet it's a bill. No. - A letter from your brother in Germany? - That's right. Sit down, darling. Read us the letter. In the name of god, the merciful. Go call akram and raji and his wife... So they can hear the news too. Ok. A letter from Germany! I'm going to read it. I heard. Now scram! Come in. A letter from Germany! I'm going to read it. Are you both coming? You go. I'll come when ahlam's asleep. All right. Here, please continue. Please honey, lie down. Stay with her, houda, until she sleeps. Are you going to read it, or shall I? Only when it's quiet. We're all quiet. No, I hear a radio on. Akram, please turn the radio off. It's not ours, it's Khalil's. Come on darling, read the letter. "In the name of god, the merciful, "dear father and mother, dear brothers and sister... "I hope you're all in good health. "I passed my exams. "It's almost vacation. "I'm off to the alps with friends..." So... the alps! Some go up mountains, others go to the ground. Your son didn't leave to study. He left to get out of this mess. Oh, akram, do stop it! "Stop it, stop it", what a bore! Go on reading, radar. Study or no study, he passed his exams. Your father thinks so too. Does any one complain when you're roaming the streets? - Sit down. - Stop it now. I want to hear what your brother writes. Isn't it bad enough he's not with us? Attention! Attention! [Comes from speaker in streets] A curfew has been imposed until further notice. All offenders will be punished! - Come on! Get inside! - Wait! Get in! Just a minute! I knew we'd have a curfew today. I knew things'd go wrong today. What does it matter, dear. We're just sitting around anyway. [Mysterious music] Attention! Attention! To everybody a curfew has been imposed until further notice. All offenders will be punished! I told you a hundred times to cut that crap! Don't blame me! I didn't make the curfew! Come, sit with your father don't be so mean to your little brother! I'm sick of his jokes. I'll get even with him one day. Is she asleep, houda? Yes, finally. Can we get something to eat? - Where are you going? - To hang the laundry out in the sun. Aren't you afraid? It's not like it used to be. - Nowadays they shoot you. - Don't worry. I'll be done before the soldiers see me. Last week they shot a woman on her own doorstep. Even the sun...! It's shining outside. Perfect for the wash! Um raji, dry it in the courtyard like last time. Papa, we still have the curfew clotheslines specially made for the courtyard. The nails are still in the wall. Go and get the lines for your mother, dear. - Are you alone? - Yes. Just me. Sabah, did you hear the loudspeaker? Yes. Mother's worried about my brother. He's not home yet. When the jeeps drove by, I called out to them: "No curfew now, please. Sabah's brother isn't home yet". But they didn't listen. Why didn't you wait for me yesterday? I only had 5 hours class, you had 7. You want me to wait in front of the girls' school!? Go now, go! - Thank you... - Teacher - for keeping our school... - So tidy and neat. - Our school... - Is very nice. - The nicest... - Of all schools. - The bus drives on. - My uncle from Istanbul... Told me a story... It made me cry. Sit. Don't move. Listen, radar... Keep your mouth shut or I'll beat your brains out. In front of your father you pretend you're still a child. But you aren't any longer. I don't go and blab, you see. Don't think father's so dumb. Even when he's asleep, he knows what's going on a block away. That's your fault. They should cut out your tongue! You can stay father's little boy, or we can become friends. Being friends would be better. Just say it... What do you want from me? You slip out the window, and go to majdalawi's house. Knock three times for saïd. He'll give you a brown bag. Bring it back and be careful. No one must see you. You have it already!? How did you know about the bag? Hallo, um raji! - Welcome. - How are you? - Bless you. Here is some food. It's delicious. - Have a taste. - Thank you. Um raji, could you spare a lemon? Of course! Amal, can you get me two lemons? I want to ask you something, Salma. You once told me about an old woman who interprets dreams. She lives next to my uncle's wife. Is something wrong? I had such a strange dream and since then I can't sleep any more. I can't stop worrying till someone interprets it. We'll go drink coffee at my aunt's. Then the woman can interpret it and you'll feel better again. She is very good at it. They all go to see her. - Don't forget it, please. - Don't worry. Thank you, thank you. What should we do about akram? Be patient with him, father. I've been patient. But you see what happens. I know. No one talks to his father like that! What a time we live in! He just follows his own impulses. He's calmer now. Oh, for how long? Want to know the truth? I don't give a damn about the curfew. I can't go anywhere anyway! When I go out, everyone asks what I'm doing, where I'm going. You know father. Akram's even worse. But you're a young girl. They care about you. The world is crazy these days! Radar is little too and goes out. But no one asks him anything! Amal, earlier I wasn't even allowed to go near the door! Turn off the radio! They're shooting! They're shooting! Do you hear? They're shooting! - You hear? - Quiet, listen. Those are plastic bullets. Plastic bullets again... That's a rubber one. That's a blank. I hope nobody gets hurt! They're firing ammunition now! That's teargas! Shut the windows! Houda, shut the windows in your room. The child's sleeping there! The courtyard's full of gas! - Are there any onions? - On the kitchen table! Go and ask Khalil what he wants. The child! Um raji, may I have some onions? Take the onions. - Wait. Have some more. - The child! Hurry! Amal, take more onions! The place is full of gas! They should cover their eyes and noses immediately! Show me. Amal. Show me your eyes. - Go away! They're burning! - Let me have a look. They'll get better. Don't be afraid. Let me see. Open your eyes a bit. We don't need any more perfume. The teargas is fading. Just in case. There might be more. The windows are shut. I prefer their gas to that perfume of yours! And what about dinner? There's just enough for the little girl. - God bless you! - You too. Akram, dinner is ready. I'll come later. Raji, dinner is ready. Bring some onions, houda. Houda, please bring your father's plate. Thank you. You didn't finish the letter. After dinner, radar will read the letter. - And you... - Listen, I hear something outside. Radar, what's going on? It's um Khalid. The army's in her house. Drag him out, yosé! Get in the car! Let him go! Where are you taking him?! God will punish you! God will kill you! - They took him away. - Who? Your friend, Khalid. Sit down, akram. There's nothing you can do. Eating, sleeping, prison, gas! And we can't do a thing! What do you want then? You want to die, go to prison!? You want them to destroy your house? You call this living? What are you up to, akram? At the drop of a hat, you pack your bags. Pull yourself together! Father is ill. He's worried about you. And where are you going at this moment? Aren't you afraid? I'll be all right. What must be, must be. Akram, sit down! I'm talking to you! Think of your parents! Show some respect! All right... don't worry. I'll stay. The child has trouble breathing. Where was she during the teargas? In the room. The windows were open. Are you coming, Khalil? Is that all the food left, houda? That's all, mother. Let's organize things. This is for tomorrow. For the day after tomorrow. For the day after that. For the day that follows. How many days do we have? Four. But how long will the curfew last? Then let's do it like this: This is for tomorrow... ...for the day after. For the day after that... - How many days now? - Five. Um raji! Um raji! What is it, um Yousef? Mother's in the kitchen. What is it? Just a second. Where are you? What are you doing? I'm coming. Good morning. Good morning. Can radar buy me some milk? Sure. Radar can you get some milk for um Yousef? How are you? Has your daughter delivered yet? No, not yet. When will it be? Any moment. God willing. Take this, dear. Please buy a tin of milk for um Yousef. What about her health? Can you pass the money on to abas' little shop? Bring back the milk and the change. Did you have any teargas today? Not just gas, but... Here's a full report: We had asphyxiating teargas. We fought it with onions and anti-gas perfumes. Um Yousef's daughter is going to give birth. Khalil's daughter still has breathing problems. And Khalid, akram's friend, has been arrested. Is that enough? Just a second. I'll get the milk. I'll wait here. The repairman says our TV is hopeless. We better buy a new TV. All right, dear. We'll buy a new one. Should have done it before. Now we'll miss this evening's program. Have you nothing else on your mind? Can't you read a book and learn new words? It's always television! And you always complaining: "Television, television"! Until it breaks in the end. She's been living in my house since her husband left. She sleeps all day. And I talk to the walls. God help her. She's about to deliver. It isn't easy for her. I'm lucky she's with me otherwise I'd be more worried. She is your daughter. Even when they're older, they're always your children. Listen to me... Why don't you go to Germany to study like your brother? That again? Why don't you go yourself? Me!? Impossible. I'm married, I have a daughter. - I'm stuck. So I'm staying. - I'm staying too. Don't forget to refill the buckets before they shut off the water. Don't worry father, we did that already. Good girl. Radar! Yes, papa. Stay, my boy. - What is it? - Stay. Do you want some tea? Should I call mother? Abu raji! Abu raji! Where is your father? What are you doing? You can see... How's your daughter? Fine. Her mother is with her. Come in. Bring the chair so Khalil can come in. Were dying of boredom! Do you prefer sitting home with your wife or working in tel-aviv? Can you come up with... Any alternatives? There are many possibilities, but not here. Bring the backgammon game. Let's play a round. - How's your daughter? - A little better... What do you make of it? She's getting better. Another year of curfew and you'll both be backgammon champions. Have your mother make us some tea. Let's play, abu raji. Your throw. You first. Why do you like your hair loose? Don't you like it? I saw a film on TV. All the actresses had their hair loose. Fantastic! Do you want to be an actress? Not really. Well, maybe. I always wanted to go abroad to study. But they married me off and now I have a daughter. I'm different. Time will tell. Khalil, where are you? What do you want? I'm here. Our little girl! So help us god. We can't understand it. She's crying all the time. Maybe we should see a doctor. Her mother can't stop crying. You should take the child out. If the army sees you, tell them it's an emergency. No, the sun has already set. It's almost dark. If they see him, they'll shoot him. I'll climb out of the window, sneak to the house with the phone... ...and call an ambulance. No dear, I'll bring her to the hospital. I think that's best, mother. But be careful. It is very dangerous. The child is sleeping, Khalil. If necessary, um raji will take her to the hospital. Did you throw that stone? We agreed I'd do it first. If akram were here he would have found out. I was alone and thought I'd throw the stone. All right. What is it you want? To talk to you. About what? I don't know. Nothing I suppose. Well. Go now! No, you can not go out and play. Can the rooster play in the street? Only if he jumps over the wall. I could jump over the wall and play in the street too. I'm not so sure. Can you hand me the pot? I thought Germany would win, but Denmark did instead. Yes, they were lucky. In football there's no such thing as luck. Who plays better, wins. The winner wins, the loser loses, so what? You don't understand football. Who cares about football! You give me a headache! A Brazilian player... Oh, forget it. Ahlam... Ahlam... Abu raji, what did Samir say about your back? I heard he's good at healing backaches. He prescribed an American compress. We'll get one for you after the curfew. Before you go to sleep, I'll give you a massage. Samir says massages are bad. Samir prescribes compresses for everything. Where did he learn all that? We're all here now. Why don't you read the letter? I've read it so often. I know it by heart. That doesn't matter. Dear father and mother... I want you to read it from the paper. Switch off the radio, akram. "In the name of god, the merciful. "Dear father and mother, may god Grant you a long life. "And may god..." Stay seated. They cut off the electricity. Where are the matches? You're stepping on my finger. Amal, go sit next to your father. No... I'm going to bed. Amal will make your tea. I'm also going to bed. Good night. - What are you doing? - None of your business! If father sees you, he'll have a heart attack. You better shut up then. Only if you tell me what you're up to. It's none of your business! - Let it go! - No, you let it go! You better... I took it, so it's mine. Will you let go of it!? No! What's wrong with you? You can't just lie there. It's nothing. The truck was loaded with vegetables. I had to make a delivery in Jerusalem today. If I don't go tomorrow... Everything will rot. We'll have to throw all of it away. It's a sin. Don't get upset. What can you do? Just relax. Tomorrow is another day. Always the same refrain: "Tomorrow is another day... And after that comes another day." And what will happen today? Get some sleep. Maybe tomorrow things will get better. Um raji! Um raji! What is it, um Yousef? She's going to have the baby! Shall we call the midwife? Are you sure? It's not false alarm? It looks serious. Wait here. Keep an eye on her. I'll get the midwife. May god reward you. Let's see if the coast is clear. No one will see me in the dark, darling. You never know. Radar, you take that side, I'll take this side. What is it, children? - Wait a minute. I see the army. - Where? They're wrecking abu adel's house. I can't believe it! You can go out now. They won't see you, they're busy with the house. Put your black dress on and your black shawl. Abu adel's family is out in the street. The ceiling just caved in. The tree by the door has fallen over. The walls are collapsing. Get down here! You shouldn't be watching them! It happens everyday. Would they spare the house if we didn't look? When akram was born in 1973, there was also a curfew. Um Yousef went for the midwife... Who helped your mother delivering. When you were born... There was no curfew. Where was I? Oh, yes, in the barber shop. They came to tell me you were born. I invited my customer home for lunch... Before my backache. Tomorrow I'll give you a nice haircut. We'll see. Go and get my comb and scissors. Why? I don't want my hair cut now. I don't care. We have nothing better to do. It's absurd! "Do this!" "Do that!" I can't take it any more! What kind of life is this?! Abu raji! Abu raji! Open your window. I won't stay a day longer. There's no way talking to Khalil. Could I stay with you till the curfew is over? - Then I'll go to my parents. - Go where you want to. If I could, I'd bring you there myself! Calm down. What's the problem with you two? The same old story every day. This time it's different. I've had enough. Bring the chair over, dear. Come in. Let's see what we can do. Khalil... What's this? You're bleeding! I cut myself shaving. It doesn't matter. What's going on? She always forgets to get the water before they close it off. So there's no water for shaving. I only have two hands. I look after the child, I do the washing, shopping, cooking... I'm not a robot! I'm a human being! Calm down. It's not the end of the world! We have clean water. You can have some. Be patient, Khalil. Go now, she'll come later. I don't give a damn. Come on. Be patient, my girl. I know it's not easy. Your daughter is crying. Why don't you go on home? - I'm only going for my little daughter. - Go on now. It's me. Open up. Good evening. Welcome, um walid. We can't enter um walid's house. It's surrounded by the army. The street is full of soldiers. Radar, light um walid's way. Um Yousef... Um walid has arrived. I'm happy to hear that. My daughter is at her end. Hold my hand. Attention, attention... Good you're here, um walid. - Have you boiled the water? - Yes. It's coming. Attention! Attention! All men holding ID cards are ordered outside now! All offenders will be punished! What are they shouting? All men with ID cards are ordered out. So you two know what that means. I don't have an ID yet. I'm going back to bed. They can do what they want. I'm not going out. What do you want, Mr. Akram? A house search? You want to die in prison? We don't have the money for a lawyer. Let them do what they want. I'm getting dressed. Father, put something on. Akram, get ready. Where is akram? Come on, boy. - Akram, do you have your ID? - I have the damned thing! Move! Speed it up! Get him, that one... And that one. Everybody sit down! Sit! Sit! God help her through the birth. Come down here. The army's searching the houses. [Banging at t he door] They're checking if all the men are out. They'll be searching our house soon. We don't have anything to hide. They're all out there. Come down here now. What's the matter? Come here. Look at me. Are you hiding something? Is akram? You better tell me before the army comes. - I know that brother of yours! - It's not akram. Don't worry. If there's something, give it to me. I'll take care of it, dear. Wait a minute... Are you scribbling on the walls? Is it you or your brother? Take it away. All right. We'll talk about it later. Listen, sabah. Wait. Take this. I gave sana' half of the pamphlets. We've handed them all out. We'll talk about it later. I swear I'll never do it again! I'll get you, bastard! Shut your mouth! - Don't do it ever again. - Please! If anyone lands in jail, it's your fault. Please... I'll never do it again. Oh! Please! Amal... amal... Amal... why aren't you sleeping? I can't. Just try. I'm afraid. Of what? I don't know. Sit down! And you sit down! Take that one! You sit down! Go home! Go home. Go home. Take him with you. Go home. Take him with you. All of you go home! Let him go! He hasn't done anything! Keep your mouth shut! Go home! - Is it a boy or a girl? - A boy. What's his name? Um Yousef always said they should call him awad, "substitute"... To take the place of her dead son, the martyr. (Door squeaking) (Door squeaking, slams) Father, where is raji? Tell me, akram... Did they take him... ...to prison? Calm down, girl. They take a lot of people. Maybe they'll set him free tomorrow. Don't cry. They will all be back tomorrow. Don't make such a scene! There are people who lose their children and don't cry. What's the difference if raji's in prison? The whole camp is one big prison! Or do you think you're free!? Come on, houda. Don't cry. I'm not crying. We're not crying. The girl is dead... Oh, god. The girl is dead! Where are you going? Leave him be. Leave him be! Where is radar? Don't worry. He's scribbling slogans on walls again. He'll be back. "In the name of god, the merciful, "dear mother and father, "dear brothers and sister, "I hope you're all in good health. "I passed my exams. "It's almost vacation. "I'm off to the alps with friends. "Next vacation I'm coming back to you, "I'm very happy that akram is engaged. "Akram, I hope I'll be there too... Attention! Attention [From speaker]! To everybody. A curfew has been imposed... Until further notice. All offenders will be punished! "...to celebrate and meet your fiancée. "I hope you'll write to me... "And let me know how you are. "I miss you very much."
