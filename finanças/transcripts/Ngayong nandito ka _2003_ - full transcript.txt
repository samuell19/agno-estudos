[melodious music playing] Now That You're Here [best man 1] Congratulations! -[best man 2] Congrats, bro! -[best man 3] Congratulations! Way to go! So where are you spending your honeymoon? Just in Hong Kong. We have to be back right away. Where do you plan to settle down, in Manila or in Baguio? Actually, we're migrating to Canada. Excuse us. Angela is here. -Hi. -Hello, dear. Hello, hello, hello. -You're looking so beautiful. -Thank you. Where's your father? Uh, they have a special session in Congress. Didn't his secretary call you? No, she didn't. [woman] We have to go inside. [man] Yeah, go on ahead. We'll see you inside. [woman 2] I'm so excited. [camera shutter clicks] Excuse me, Mr. Rodriguez. The wedding will start soon. Where's Rocky? -What? -Where's your son? I don't know. Garie! Garie! [woman] Garie, Rocky's here. Garie! Be quiet. Kent, take care of my daughter. [camera shutter clicks] [classical music playing] Hi, Rocks, you'll be sitting at the sponsors' table. There? And, um, you will be seated at table 86, with the photographers. No, Robbie, they're my friends. They have to sit in front. But your friends from Brent will sit there. Then they will join them. [whispers] But I have strict instructions from your dad... -Robbie-- -Rocky, it's okay. Actually, we'd rather sit at that table. That way, we get to eat as much as we can without being noticed. No. -Okay. -Let's sit here. [Gia laughing] [Mrs. Rodriguez] Excuse me. Um, Gia, your cousins are waiting for you. I don't like to play with them. I want to be with Garie. They might think you're a snob. [violin playing in background] [woman 1] Angela, how's your dad? He's okay. -[woman 1] Is he coming? -No, he couldn't come. [woman 2] Where is he? -At the congress. -[Rocky mouthing] ["The Blue Danube" playing] [people clapping] My foundation is doing a charity concert on the 12th for street children. Your band should perform. We'll be in Manila by then. We have a meeting with the Consul of Japan. [camera shutter clicks] Are you really going to Japan? Yeah, why? What's wrong with that? By the way, there are rumors going around that Licauco is going to become the next environmental chief. Will he be a threat to your business? He can pick on me if he wants to. I have connections in the higher ranks. What's Congressman Benitez for? Congressman Benitez will surely help you, especially if your children do get married. And Angela seems to like Rocky very much.

And then we'll build our own house. On top of a mountain with this same view. [hoots] I want our house to be made of wood.

Look inside, there's more in there. Those denims will look nice on you. -Here's another one. -Good, I want those... -You know, Rocky... -Yes? I see my children as blessings from God.

I'm Cynthia Ascalon. I'm Derrick's purchaser. I'm sorry he can't attend to you right now so he sent me to talk to you. -Um, let's talk over here. -Okay. Thanks. Boo, what made us go over budget, anyway? [sighs] The wall in the lobby that I had demolished, that's what! And then, what else? They say that it's going to affect everything else in the floor plan. Boo, why did we have the wall removed from the plan, anyway? Boo, don't you agree that it was badly-situated? Shouldn't you have seen that in the floor plan beforehand? [scoffs] Are you saying that I'm the one who's wrong? Boo, no. But we asked for revisions. We had to pay for the extra labor, and the materials wasted, and more materials for our adjustments. Right? We could have stuck to the original plan. But what's done is done, so... So, what you're saying is that losing my temper won't help at all? Mm-hmm. Now, how about dinner later? Mm! You know, we're trying to finish the hotel in time for its opening date, and we're still doing some revisions to the plan. So, uh, we do have your number and we'll just get back to you, okay? Okay, so when do I expect your call? [chuckles] We'll call you. [secretary] Thank god, Miss Margaret came, it's quieter around here now. [giggling] Okay, but just a date, okay?

You flatter me too much! No. How old are you, anyway? Nineteen? Actually, I'm not in the calendar anymore. [in Ilocano] Anyway, atyati sadya? -Mister-- -Rocky. Rocky Rodriguez. [speaking in Ilocano] Um, I have an appointment with Mr. Cervantes, um, but I have already spoken to Cyn-- [in Filipino] Go ahead, he's inside. Your timing's good. The boss has already cooled down. -Ah, really? Thank you. -Hey. Thanks for the compliment, huh? Oh, don't mention it. To be honest with you, Mr. Rodriguez, we're thinking of just importing ready-made furniture from Hong Kong. Uh-huh... but, sir, do you know that what they're making abroad can be made locally at a cheaper price? Sorry to disturb you but-- Mr. Rodriguez? -Yes? -[sighs] Didn't I tell you that we're just going to call you? Derrick, I'm sorry, but it seemed that Mr. Rodriguez misunderstood me. Uh, Cynthia, don't worry. It's all right. Mr. Rodriguez, just give us a sample of what we want. And if we like it, we'll get back to you. That will be fine, sir. Thank you. If I get that account, we'll be able to buy our own mini-truck to use in our deliveries. We don't have to rent anymore. This is the break I've been waiting for. You've been in that business for two years now. Has it made us rich? -Mommy! -What happened? The kids in school say I'm a liar. Why? Isn't it true, Mommy? Didn't we have a Mercedes-Benz then, and a big house in Baguio? They won't believe me. They say that if it were true, then why am I in a public school? We've been poor for the last three years. If your brother hadn't backed out -of his marriage to-- -Hon! Let me see that. Let's go. -Good evening, sir. -[Derrick] Good evening. [car door opens] Boo, would you mind if I stay for a cup of coffee? Of course not. [both chuckling] Do you like it? Boo, what's this? Will you marry me? Margaret, aren't you gonna say something? A "yes" would be a good start. Marry me... Please? Yes! Yes, I will marry you! [both giggling] [romantic music playing] Is our sister really going to marry him? Not too loud, he might hear you! Be quiet, you two. It's okay, I can manage. Have some snacks. Oh. Thank you, Naida. Thank you. So, uh, when do you plan to get married? [Derrick chuckles] We haven't decided on an exact date yet, but it'll be next year, for sure. We've got our hands full so far. With the Baguio hotel opening in two months, there's still a lot to do in the next six weeks. [cell phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Atienza? Derrick, you shouldn't let work get in the way of your personal plans. Mm. She's right. Your work is not as important as your relationship with Garie. Mm-hmm. Okay, ma'am. Bye. Boo, who was that? Boo, that was Mrs. Atienza. She's hiring me for Salome Fashions. I'll be re-decorating all its branches in Metro Manila! [Nadia] Wow! Congratulations! -[Derrick] You know, sir... -Yes? it's Garie who should listen to your advice. She's a workaholic. We've been so busy with the Baguio hotel, and yet she still insists on doing other projects. Boo, you know that I will still give my best for our project. But, Boo, you better make sure of that. We still have a wedding to prepare for. -[machine whirring] -Get it inside. Bro, do you know how to use this? Just deepen the hollow a little more. What did they pick? This one? [Derrick chuckles] -This is nice. -Okay, sir? -You really made this? -Yes, sir. It's nice. -Thank you. -And besides, I can also give you lifetime warranty on all my furniture. Okay. In three weeks, deliver us all that we need for the hotel. Coordinate with Cynthia about the job order. You will also be working with Margaret, my interior designer. Cynthia will take care of the contract too. So I'll go ahead. I still have an important meeting. Sir. We can't do it in three weeks. Why? You don't have enough people? It's not that, sir. It's just that... Actually, whether it's one or one dozen, it usually takes us six to ten weeks to finish our furniture. Six weeks? Yes, sir. Six weeks. If you want quality, sir, I won't be able to give you that in three weeks. So, should I push through with importing from Hong Kong? Okay, thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. Thank you. -Mr. Rodriguez. -Yes, sir? Do you know how much furniture I will be getting from you? Do you have any idea how many? It's going to be worth more than what you can make in a year. Yes, I know, sir. But, you see, small businesses like mine rely on referrals from satisfied clients. If I rush our work, the furniture might not come out as good. My business will not benefit from a bad reputation. [Derrick] Dad, this one's a surefire thing. You have the best location. Baguio. And you have the best builder. I do hope so. I do hope so. Daddy, take my word for it. Boo, it's your turn. Come on, Dad. Believe me. I have a great team. I have Margaret and I have the best furniture maker in town. Boo, I thought we were going to import from Hong Kong? Boo, you won't believe this guy. I'm impressed with his work. And he's not an ass-kisser. Besides, we'll save more if we get our furniture from him. Mm. Where'd you find this guy? Ms. Mari referred him to me. Really? -Who's this guy? -Rocky Rodriguez. [gasps] [breathing heavily] -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. -Ma'am? -What's this? It just arrived from Sir Derrick's office, ma'am. A sample piece of furniture by Rocky Rodriguez. My family's from Baguio, and... [clears throat] my family is into logging business before. But dad had some illegal transactions, and the tax bureau found out, till now, his case is pending in court. Our logging license was revoked. They took away our business permit. So everything followed. Our properties were all gone. It was a big embarrassment to dad so he moved us all here. So we're here in Manila, starting over. [somber music playing] [breathes heavily] By the way, Rocky, Margaret's my fiancée, so don't feel awkward around us. Oh, no. She also studied in Baguio where she finished her interior design. Oh. Oh, there she is. -Boo! -Sorry, I'm late. It's okay. -Boo, this is, uh-- -Yeah, Rocky. So, it's really you. Oh, have a seat. I thought I misheard your name from Derrick. How are you? You know each other? We were in the same band before. Ah, well, then good. It will be easier for you to work together. So, Rocky, do you have kids? Excuse me. Excuse me. -Rocky, are you okay? -Yes, I'm okay. Uh, Boo, was there something-- Boo, no. He was the band member who left us hanging in Japan. That's just my fear, you know. He might just do it again. If we're getting our furniture here, what's wrong with John? He's reliable. No, I've seen John's work. That made me decide to get our furniture from Hong Kong. And besides, Boo, we should give Rocky a chance. He has great potentials. -[cell phone ringing] -Excuse me. Hello? Oh, Cynthia, what's the problem? What? Garie is your interior designer? Well, it's been almost three years. Both of you have... ...moved on. I still want her forgiveness, Mom. [assistant] Good afternoon. What's your name, sir? Rocky Rodriguez. Rocky, come in. Have a seat. -Coffee? -No, thank you. Uh, Garie... Margaret. [chuckles] Nobody calls me Garie anymore. [glass tinkling] Listen, in a few minutes, my staff will arrive, and I still have clients to meet. Um... Sorry. Um, I know it's an awkward situation for the both of us. I didn't know that... If you want, I can still back out of the project. Rocky, you shouldn't worry. It will be strictly professional. And Derrick doesn't know anything about what happened between us. We never talked about it, actually. He doesn't even have to know. In our relationship, the past is past. So let's just be both professionals. Sure. By the way, how long have you been in the furniture business? Where do you display your work? If you want to, you can place some of them here. And I could recommend you to some of my friends. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. As I've said... that was a long time ago. I'm okay now. I hope you are too. Margaret? -Hey, Elizabeth! -Margaret! [both giggling] Elizabeth, we're meeting tomorrow, right? Well, I couldn't wait that long. I heard from Derrick that you're getting married soon! I'm so happy for the both of you. [Garie] Thank you. Oh, sorry. Pardon me. I was just so excited. No, no. It's okay. Um, Rocky, this is Elizabeth. -Hi. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. -I was about to leave. Thank you, Margaret. Bye. [sighs] [Rocky] I thought that asking for her forgiveness would be the hardest thing for me to do. But what comes after is more difficult. [sniffles] Because this is the time that I need to move on. [sighs] I'm starting all over again. This is-- And the first and the right thing I should do is to accept the fact that... we're really not meant for each other. All right, Mrs. Atienza, I will show you my designs. Okay. Um, Friday? Wait, I'll check. All right. Bye. Um, Rocky, this is the fabric that I've chosen for the sofas in the lobby. Um, I brought more swatches. Here. Okay, and... For the rooms, I think this would be nice, but I want it darker. This one. You've changed so much. Um, who's your supplier? Cityline gives me a 20 percent discount. -Boo. -Boo. [Garie] Mm. Hi! So, are you excited about this project? Of course. This is my third hotel. I have a small one in Palawan, then I opened up another one in Tagaytay. Just three months ago. I'm proud of my hotels, Rocky. But my favorite is the one in Baguio. Maybe because I negotiated for it on my own, for the first time, without my father's help Actually, if Margaret would agree, I would want our wedding reception to be held in that hotel. Really, Boo? But its ballroom is so big, we'll have to fill it up with 500 guests. [chuckles] So do you agree to have our wedding in Baguio? -Why not? -Good! Mm! [chuckles] Rocky, should you decide to get married, just pick any one of my hotels for your honeymoon. I think Palawan is a good choice. It's beautiful there. Sure, why not? As long as you give me a discount. [Derrick chuckles] You're getting married again? Boo, he's not married. Your marriage to Angela was annulled, then? [Derrick chuckles] He's a runaway groom! [chuckles] [Derrick] I'm sorry, Rocky, I already did a little research on you. 'Cause when you told me that your family was into the logging business before, I thought of the Rodriguezes of Isabela. And so I found out that Don Federico is your father. Angela was my classmate in college. We're not really close, but we have common friends. But, Rocky, you puking at the altar was legendary! [Derrick chuckles] He was so drunk and vomited on the day of their wedding. It became the talk of the town! But then, Angela's so snotty. She probably deserved it. How come you don't know about all this, Boo? They were in Japan at that time. [Derrick] Ah. Is that why you had to skip Japan? Because you were marrying Angela? Well, what made you back out of the wedding, anyway? I was in love with someone else. [Derrick] Oh. So, where is she now? Uh... She's now in love with someone else. [chuckles] Ouch. Well, anyway, that's life. [chuckles] Yeah, that's life. -Good evening, ma'am. -Good evening. [dramatic music playing] [whimpers] [sobs] [sobbing] [sniffles] [sniffles] -Hey, Rocky. -Hi. Hi. -[chuckles] Boo, have a seat. -Hi. Um, I want to show you some sample swatches for the hotel. -Margaret prefers darker shades. -Mm-hmm. So I brought some. This one's a sample finish. Margaret? Yeah, mm-mm. This one's okay. Uh, Rocky, are you free tomorrow? Tomorrow... why? I want you and Margaret to go to Baguio so that you can see the hotel for yourself. Yes, sure. Boo... Boo, let me guess. You have a meeting with Mrs. Atienza again? [sighs] [sighs] Just as I thought. You don't have time for our hotel anymore. [hopeful music playing] Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. Please double-check the measurements, okay? -Yes, sir. -Okay. -Oliver. -Margaret. How's everything? The West Wing has improved a great deal. Good. Um... Where's Derrick? Ah, he's dropping by next week. He's been busy. By the way, this is Rocky Rodriguez. He's our furniture-maker. -Hi. -Architect Lazaro. -[Rocky] Nice to meet you. -Hi. -Um, Amanda? -[Amanda] Ma'am? Would you give Rocky a tour around the hotel? Yes, ma'am. Is that okay with you, Rocky? Of course. Okay. [Amanda] This way, sir. We're here at the hotel. Yeah, we've finally checked in. Actually, I just don't like the color of the tiles especially in the kitchen. You can have them adjusted if you like. [Garie on phone] No, they're okay. [chuckles] I wish I'm there with you, Boo. [Derrick on phone] I'm starting to miss you already. I miss-- [romantic music playing] [Derrick over the phone] Hello, are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here. -Bro. -Sir? -Can I play the piano? -Yes, sir.

Rocky! -Bugoy! -Bro! Garie! -[Garie] Bugoy! [Bugoy] Whoa. How are you two? You've been gone for so long! Are you both back toge--? No. She's getting married soon. [Karlyn] You're getting married? How did that happen? Obviously, I have a fiancé. But how about Rocky? [indistinct dialogue] Hey, we're okay. We've both moved on and we're fine. Yeah, and I'm sure Rocky will find someone for himself, too. [bottle clanking] Just out of curiosity, can you honestly say that you don't have any feelings for Rocky anymore? -Oh, no, no. -[chuckles] Come on, we all saw how you cried in Japan. You even left us. Garie! Rocky! -Hey, bro! -Chie! -Hey, how are you? -How are you? -I'm good, bro. -My, your belly's grown! Yeah, right. How are you? -I'm fine. -How are you? The funniest is when we were at the thrift shop. [all laughing] But this is what I really won't forget about Garie and Rocky. [Justin] This better be funny. -Let me finish first, will you? -Bro... You know what, I really can't believe that you two ended up together. Yeah. You're complete opposites! [Menchie] Do you know about Rocky and Garie's darkest secret? -[Karlyn shushes] -[Justin] What is it? -When Rocky proposed to Garie, -Guys, that's past now. and Garie said yes. [Justin chuckling] [Menchie] My, that's one big secret! [Banjo] That's a long time ago. Let's not talk about that. [Justin] Come on, Garie's getting married, anyway. So spill the beans! [Menchie] Right! Here goes. Did you know that Rocky cried when Garie finally said yes? -[Banjo] Really? -[Menchie] Can you guys do that? [Justin] But I'm sure you cried louder. That's what you're good at! -[Justin laughs] -[Menchie] I did not! -[Karlyn] My goodness. -[Banjo] Oh, yeah! You were practically like a married couple then, weren't you? -[Karlyn] Stop it. -[Bugoy] They were inseparable. [Karlyn] Why are you like that? And she got pregnant, remember? -[Bugoy] Hm. -Huh? -Huh? -Stop it! When Rocky was caught for entering a one-way lane, Garie stuffed her things under her dress and pretended that she was about to give birth! -[Menchie] Yeah, I remember! -[chuckles] [Bugoy] That's enough reminiscing for tonight! [Menchie] But they still got caught, right? [Banjo] The police insisted on escorting them to the hospital. [all laughing] [music playing] -Hey, bro, it's the 24! -Twenty-four! -Go, Rocky! -Go! -Come on, bro! -Hurry up! -They're starting again. -[Justin] Woo-hoo!

[Derrick] Let's go? -Boo, I-- -Boo, we won't be long. I just want to check his progress with our furniture. Boo, I'll just wait for you here. Boo, let's not argue about this. Let's just drop by, since we're here, anyway. -Come on, Boo. -[car door opens] We just came from mass. We were in the area so we thought of dropping by to see how you're doing. [groans] How about some snacks? -Garie? -Gia! -Garie! -[Garie chuckles] You've been gone for so long! I missed you a lot! [chuckles] -Good morning. -Good morning. Mom, this is Derrick Cervantes. -[Rocky] Derrick, my mom. -How are you, ma'am? [stammers] I'm fine. [Federico] Rocky! Rocky! You said you were going to the office of-- Hon! We have guests. Daddy, Garie is here! [chuckles] [sighs] Dad, Derrick Cervantes. A client of mine. Sir, good morning. Cervantes. Are you related to Theodore Cervantes? Yes. He's my father. [Derrick] So you're close with Rocky's family. Garie, nice nickname, huh. Margaret. -Margaret! -[gasps] What's wrong with you? Nothing. Nothing? You've been in this state for days. What's your problem? -Boo, I'm not-- -[Derrick] You're not yourself. I've been talking to myself all this time! And you weren't even listening. Sorry, Boo. What were you saying? Nothing. Lito! Can't you drive any faster? You're so slow! How long will you continue to punish me? Derrick's my client. Did you have to embarrass me in front of him? You only think of yourself. Have you thought of how we felt when you ran out on Angela? What do I have to be ashamed of? I was just asking for a small favor. Derrick's father knows Licauco. If my own son couldn't help me, maybe others could. [utensils clinking] Your dad's just asking for an appointment with Mr. Licauco. Don't worry about it. Dad says he's going to take care of it. [sighs] My father's culpable. He was charged with illegal logging. Rocky, everybody deserves a second chance. Who knows... I do hope there'll be some changes. -Anyway, Derrick, thanks. -You're welcome. By the way, what happened to the revisions that Julie was talking about? Margaret was supposed to send those yesterday-- I'll bet Margaret hasn't finished them yet. I don't know what's wrong with her. She doesn't seem to be herself lately. I'm starting to lose my patience with her. But anyway, I'll follow it up with her. [door closes] Garie. [sighs] Garie, what's wrong, is this about Baguio? If you're mad, say it, so I know what to do. Please. We're not the only ones involved here. Even Derrick is starting to get suspicious. Garie, tell me if I hurt you. Garie, I wanna know what's wrong. [voice breaking] You want to know what's wrong? This is wrong! We were wrong! I was fine, you know... until you came back! You know what, when you left me... my life was miserable. But of course, you never knew that. [whimpers] You don't know how it was like to be lost in Japan. You don't even know where to go. I was an illegal alien for six months. I always have that fear... that they might catch me. I didn't want to go back to the Philippines. [sobbing] I didn't want to see you! But that's fine. Do you know what hurts more? During those cold nights... I would always ask myself... "Where did I go wrong? How could it be... that the person I've loved did not even fight for me?" And you never knew all about that. Do you know what I told myself? I told myself that the next time we meet again, I'm going to show you that leaving me was a big mistake. [sighs] Then you suddenly came back. And this foolish heart... [sobs] still yearns for you after all this time. Up until the end, I'm still the one who's hurt. I'm still the one who loses. -[sniffles] -I'm sorry. Let me go. [engine starts] -Yes? -Is Margaret in? She's not. Sorry. Uh, could you do me a favor, then? Yes. -Kindly give this to her. -I will. -Okay. Thank you. -All right. [paper ripping] Rocky? Rocky... The collage, how did you--? I went to Japan to look for you. I learned that you had left the band. But I still looked for you. -And hoped that someday... -[sniffles] fate leads me to you. I found your boarding house. [sobs] You had already gone back to the Philippines. [sobbing] I kept returning to your house in Sampaloc... until a different family moved in. No one can tell me where you relocated. All I could do was hope that someday... I would meet you again. [sobbing] [Rocky sighing] And now you're here. I found you. You know what I told myself? I told myself... [chuckles] maybe the wrong I'd done to you ultimately did you good. [sobbing] So don't think that it was your fault. It wasn't. Because I was the one who failed you. For now, I don't expect you... to forgive me this soon. But I'm hoping that someday, you will. For now I'm happy enough that you're fine... [sobbing continues] [sniffles] ...and happy in the arms of Derrick. I will no longer bother you. [sobbing continues] [sniffles] Face Derrick now. Don't live in the past anymore. You have to make a decision. Choose what's right for you now and for the future. But what if... the choice that seems wrong now turns out to be the right one in the future? [chuckles] Derrick is part of your present life. You should take that risk together. Margaret, what's really happening to you? Are we still okay? I'm sorry. [scoffs] What now? Are you breaking up with me? Please tell me. Please don't make me feel like a fool. No. Then... why aren't you answering my calls? Derrick... It's about Rocky. He's the reason why I was crying in Japan. At first, I did my best to work well with him, for your sake. Even if I was still so mad at him, I-- Why did you tell me this just now? All this time that we were working together? Margaret, I know that past is past in our relationship, but... Are you cheating on me? Huh? Are you? No. I'm sorry. It has affected our relationship. I just didn't know what to do then. I don't know where to put myself. But Rocky and I have talked-- -Do you still love him? Do you? -Derrick... I would be unfair to you if... I answer that question. I won't blame you if you'll get mad at me. I will understand if... you will leave me. But I ask you to give me some time... to find myself. [dramatic music playing] [groans] [grunts] [grunting continues] [groans] [grunts] [groans] Um, I would understand if you would take me out of the project. I can return the down payment. No. I'm a businessman. And I have a deadline to meet. Finish the project. But you are not to set foot in this office anymore. Just send your representative if we need to talk. I don't want Margaret to see you again. I hope you understand. You can leave now. [Federico] Rocky! What have you done to Derrick's family this time? Huh?! Why is Teddy backing out of our agreement? Is it Garie again? Is she the reason? When will that girl stop being such a problem for us?! It's Garie again? If you're not blaming me, you're blaming her. You keep on blaming everyone! We weren't the ones who broke the law, Dad. You did. Why do Garie and I have to pay? Why us? [sighs] For three years, you've been making me pay for what I didn't do. [sniffles] Aren't you tired, Dad? [sobs] You're already confined to that chair but you're still controlling me. I may have failed to save our business then, but I never abandoned you. I gave my all... for this family. Even the woman I love, I had to give up for you! [sobs] What more do you want from me? Can't you just... [sobbing] be a father to me now, Dad? Even just for now? I miss my father. [sobbing] [elevator dings] Derrick? [Derrick] Boo, after our hotel here is finished, we can fly to Italy, and get married there. If that's okay with you. Mm-hmm. -Mom, we can manage. -No, let me help. Get going! Wrap it well so that it doesn't get scratched. Yes, sir. And be careful when you carry it to the truck later! Mrs. Atienza, I hope you understand. But I really have to back out from the project. There are things in my life that I have to prioritize. Okay. Bye. Excuse me, ma'am. The pieces of furniture delivered by Rocky Rodriguez have just arrived. [indistinct dialogue] Hi, Boo. [chuckles] Boo. We're really on our way, huh? Our tickets are here. [chuckles] I still love her very much. [glass pouring] [utensils clinking] Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing. Boo... Do you still remember the first time we met? Of course. I was working in a Filipino store in Japan. You saw me crying. You came to me. You tried to make me laugh... with those jokes about us Filipinos. [chuckles] But I couldn't make you laugh, right? You said... you'd better just leave, because you couldn't cheer me up, anyway. Boo... do you still remember my joke back in Japan? There's an American, a Japanese, and a Filipino stuck in an island. They're very, very sad. Until they saw a lamp. They rubbed the lamp, and a genie came out. He will give them three, three-- [Derrick sobbing] Boo? What's wrong? I wish the genie was real. I'm gonna wish that someday, maybe I can make you mine. I'm a selfish man, Margaret. I could have simply taken you away from him. [whimpers] But I'm not like that. Margaret, I won't be happy knowing that it's him you really love. Even if it hurts me, I have to let you go. [whimpers] [sniffles] Boo, I'm sorry, I tried. [Margaret sobbing] [Derrick] And I thank you. Until the very end... you still chose me, even if there's someone else in your heart. But it hurts to see you... being miserable with me. Derrick... I love you. [sniffles] Don't think that I never loved you. [sniffles] [both sobbing] Derrick? He doesn't know about my decision. I did this so that you two can finally talk. I have to go. I have a plane to catch. Derrick? I thought it was just going to be you? I'm letting go of Garie. She may have chosen me, but you're still the one she loves. You know it hurts me to see you cry. I just can't believe that... you're here. And we'll never have to be apart again.
