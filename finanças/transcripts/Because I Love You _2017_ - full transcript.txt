NEXT ENTERTAINMENT WORLD presents an AD406 production EXECUTIVE PRODUCER KIM Woo-taek PRODUCER CHA Ji-hyun CHA Tae-hyun KIM You-jung SEO Hyun-jin LIM Ju-hwan It's all ready, sir. - Thank you. - Good luck! When was your most nerve-racking day of your life? I bet there are many, but the day you proposed to your love? Bingo! We received a ton of requests for Yoo Jae-ha's song today. He died tragically when his own love life was blossoming, perhaps his song helped many lovers come together. The ring... How did I forget the ring! 'Because I love you.' Hyun-kyoung Why isn't she answering? The first time I felt your gaze, was it just my own misunderstanding? With your bright smile, you made me into a fool The day you left me Lovely pink-tinted memories in my heart have faded into blue BECAUSE I LOVE YOU Jesus! You're finally coming to. Are you okay? Where is this? Why am I... Kim Mal-hee, are you alright? Who are you talking to? Me? Who else is here besides you, Mal-hee? But I don't think I'm Mal-hee... Then who could you be? Well, I'm... (Kim Mal-hee) - How could a top student not even remember her own name? It could be amnesia, get it checked out. Studying is good and all, but health comes first. What's this? Eh?! "Kim Mal-hee"? Mal-hee! Mr. Ahn is asking for you! Dammit! Feeling okay? Your posture... Dammit... Did you bring your intro? What? For the college application. I don't even know myself, how can I introduce myself? Application period must be causing a lot of stress. Would you like some sugar? Sweets are best for stress. Oops, I ate those. Mal-hee? What's wrong with her? - Isn't that Mal-hee? - Kim Mal-hee? Jesus Christ... Wait, so I'm a girl? It's all wrong! This is a dream. It's a dream! A dream! Look at that... We got a crazy girl, what's with her? Applying to colleges brings out the crazies... Let it be a dream! Please! This girl has no upper body strength! Amazing! Whoa, rad! Who's this? You should've tossed it, you could get caught with it. Don't worry, I didn't see anything. Wait, if there are 2 lines... She's pregnant? "She"? The shock must have been overwhelming. You know her? You're friends with Mal-hee? Mal-hee... So it's like a ghost. That's total nonsense. I don't remember dying at all. Recollection of your past life? Not even name or age? Got any more lemon? I think it's helping. What about gender? I think... I was a guy. - You sure? - What? Yeah. Stand up. What the! A guy, indeed. Denial of oneself, a classic symptom of escapism. Mal-hee. I'm not Mal-hee! Fine! Good to meet you, I'm Scully. Not Jang Su-yi? And you're not Mal-hee. Be honest, do you believe me? Only a select few believed that the earth was round at first. You've also lost it. - Where you going? - Mind your business! And what's with your tone ever since we met? You're being rude to your elders. Look at this guy. You don't even remember your age, if you end up being younger, I'll cut your balls off. Come on! Hey! I'm coming with you! So annoying... Stop following me! Where are you going? You don't remember anything! Right... That's exactly the problem. Psychic Give me $10. So you woke up in a girl's body? Don't remember your age, gender or birthday. I told you many times! That's the crazy part! He's so clueless. This is too crazy. Okay, fine... Go away. Just leave. Where? Your pre-destined path. Come on, let's get out of here. You got epilepsy or something. There's a -30ï¿½ creek in Kangwon Province, go dip yourself in it and you'll be cured! Basis of the service industry is courtesy! That's the standard! One look and he should've known. How does a psychic not know? It's far more serious than I thought... Gotta regain memory to find the baby's father. That's just nonsense! Come on, accept the truth! The shock of your, I mean, Mal-hee's pregnancy news could have triggered this. What are you so serious about? What is it? I keep thinking why but you look so calm You might not know, but you are the one But the way it is, it's just fine In the blink of an eye, I fell deeply in love you with I know it's not like me, but I'm already in love with you Hyun...kyoung? Hyun-kyoung! Maybe you were a chef or delivery boy here. (Hyun-kyoung) Now I understand why you're 28th in class. I don't think it's your name though. "Hyun-kyoung" is a girl's name. It's the only thing I remember, it means something. It's no joke, you can't eat anything. You could get expelled for being pregnant. A girl last year got the boot for corruption of public morals. You gotta give birth, so college is out of the question. What? It's coming? Doctor, it can't be coming! No way! No way! That's so wrong! - So what then? - I dunno. But I'm never going to give birth to a baby! Being top of the class is not for everyone, right? The stress that comes with it is tremendous. Forgetting basic things is a symptom of extreme stress. Then, are you #2 in class? Nope. Then how'd you know about such stress? Come on... Because we're friends. Isn't that right? But you don't know where she lives? Officers. Do you know when lovers break up? When they know each other too well and the mystique wears off. Friendship is like that too. Mal-hee? What are you doing here? Mother? Good evening. That was interesting. - Did you eat? - Pardon? Did you have dinner? Uh, yes, ma'am. What's with you today? And that awkward tone too. My head... Good night. Good night, Ms. Daughter. (Yoo Jae-ha) So a girl with great taste gets herself knocked up. "Because I Love You." She already got ultrasound? (Hi, I'm Kim Mal-hee. Good luck to us...) Look at that. She's got a few screws loose. Do you understand? 'Dong Le ma.' - Dong Le ma. - Once more. - Dong Le ma. - Dong Le ma. I understand, how would you say that? How would you answer it? - Dong Le! - Very good! Just remove the postposition. - Dong Le! - Dong Le! Where are you going? The toilet? Dong Le? What the hell am I supposed to do? It might be good for the baby. So he must be the douche. It's you? What? - You're him! - What? Mal-hee... You douche! Shut up! Young, much too young. I'll take responsibility. You'll do what? I'll be a good dad. You're already a bad dad. You're not considering the other option, right? - Mal-hee... - Kneel, douche! Kneel! Please don't do that, you promised. I love the baby, and you too. "Love"? Screw that. What a load of crap. I'll raise the baby, and do more part-time work, and support you so you could study. Support yourself! You're just a child! I'll do whatever you ask of me. If I tell you to kill yourself, would you do that? What I mean is... I was going to die anyway. If it wasn't for you, I'd have jumped from there. You held my hand and smiled. That's how you came into my life. Then why? This isn't you. I'm gonna have an abortion, only that will save us. Will you be okay? Better than seeing my belly inflate. But the thing is, what'd Mal-hee want? About the abortion. There's something you're forgetting, it's hard to go through with this when you can think straight. The choice is mine right now. She will be thankful. Let's get you prepped. Wait! Wait! Okay. It's gonna hurt a bit. Ghost! Are you in pain? What's wrong? - It's my head! - Your head? What's going on? Are you okay? Hey! Ghost! It's a Yoo Jae-ha cover? It'll be hard to sing a song with male sensibility. You must really like his music. Yes. What do you like about it? Yoo's music contains sensibilities of fluttering hearts, and loneliness. But he departed this world in an age of love, it's ironic. I don't think that way. I think Yoo's still around, connecting people with love. Lee-hyung here says the same thing whenever he drinks. Let's give it a listen. Hyun-kyoung... The first time I felt your... Hyun-kyoung! Hey, Hyun-kyoung! Hyun-kyoung! Mal-hee! Sweetie! Please don't do this, I'll do my best. Yo-sep... Where are we? Ghost! Are you in there? Why are you here? Yo-sep, where are we? Let's go home. But... Where did he go? - You okay, boss? - Det. Park! Huh? What's going on? Where am I? Det. Park! Sir! Are you okay? What happened? And who are you? What's wrong? Did you see the Perm? I think he came this way. Him? It's not him? Shit, boss! Requesting support! You owe me! How could you! This is the real you, huh? You're too much. You know him? I'm getting the cold shoulder now? Look back to all the tips that I brought you. I even fed you, gave you a bed and pocket money too. A corrupted cop? This is nuts... You were kicked out! Why? You're killing me! This is too crazy! No wonder your wife gave you the boot. You don't make the dough, long hours and never come home, and get stabbed during stakeouts. Over a year you said. Yeah? It's game over then. Our long friendship was built on cash. Why don't we just let this one slide under the table? (Name: Oh Yong-choon) - Under the table? - Expensive table. Illegal gambling, blackmail, fraud, embezzlement... - You're a bad guy. - Come on, boss. What's with you? You fucking douche. Out-of-body experience. What's this? "OOB experience, don't click". Holy shit! What are you watching? What's going on? Nothing. Stop wasting time and go home. You didn't go home for a few days because of the stakeout. You'll really get kicked out like this? I can go home? What's with you? You're the boss here. What I mean is... where's my home? Who's this woman? Owner of this apartment? The door is opening. I'm starving. - You hungry? - Jesus! No dinner if you come home late. Want some Cocoball? What? You didn't eat till this late? Cocoball is best when living by yourself. No one to look after you, what do we do with you? I know you're getting divorced. Pregnancy, now divorce. Do you even know what that is? So many of my kindergarten friends' parents are divorced. You don't want us to get divorced, right? It's better than fighting everyday. You won't listen to what I want anyway. Then do you know why we're getting divorced? You mean you don't know? Holy cow! What a bitch... I know everything about Arong. Right, Arong? You promised to take me to a baseball game. - Hello? - It's me. Who? I wish I could answer that myself. - Who am I? - Ghost? Yup. What happened to your voice? This is bad! Mal-hee wasn't the end! I became a low life cop! A cop? You sure? - I'll call you back. - Ghost! You got a girl? What are you talking about? Not gonna sleep? - I heard a girl's voice. - No, it wasn't. Let's go to bed. Even if you'll divorce, sleep in the same bed. You haven't been home in a while. I'll sleep better right here. Are you uncomfortable with us? Wow, he took the bait. (Wifey: Got a death wish? How dare you sleep here!) Who texts so early? What the hell?! Huh? This wasn't me! What? Don't wanna hear your voice, text instead. Uncuff me right away! So this is what a marriage without talks is like. Where did I put my key? The kid must've took it. Where's the kid? I said don't talk, text! Jung-min must've gone to the kindergarten alone! We're due in court at noon, I won't go like this. Go where?! Let's go to the kindergarten, the kid should have it! Jung-min went on a field trip. Read the damn family newsletter! Then what do we do?! You can't cut steel with knife, you're hopeless. Are you nuts? So where's Jamsil Lotte World? You stupid moron... In Jamsil! Stop texting, this is getting old. You're worthless! So annoying. Taxi! Taxi! Wait! Even with the AC on, it's still hot. Quite hot, isn't it? Yes, indeed. Don't do it! Mommy, save me! You bastard! Get another cab! We're almost there, let's just walk like this. Seriously... Hey, Scully! Scully! Scully! Okay, okay! All done! I'm suffocating. Hey, wake up. Get off of me! Looks like a bad sprain. You're not a doctor. Don't diagnose me and call 911. There's no cell signal down here. Hello? Help us! Please help! Is there even a rule? How do I get out of this body? Can you close your eyes? Why? What for? Just do what I say for once! Shut them good! Fine. Done, why? You son of a bitch! What are you trying to pull! I already feel like death! How could you beat me over a kiss! It's not like that! I can't breathe! My heart is about to burst. I... have claustrophobia! Phobia? Hyun-kyoung, feeling better? Lee-hyung. What happened? It's been a while. Sorry, I caused a scene. I didn't know you were a judge. Where have you been? You left without a word. I went around singing. But I want to stop now. I wanted to challenge myself one last time. This is the end, I guess. Are you sick? I have glossophobia. You mean stage fright? We're walking in circles. Be quiet! I'm tired as is! I told you we should've gone the other way at the fork! It's my fault for trying to salvage our marriage. Don't you worry. We'll get to the court by noon, and sign our divorce papers. I want to leave! Okay! Okay! Please! Which way... Hey. How's your breathing? Since when did you have claustrophobia? What exactly do you know about me? Do you know my name? Jung-min's mom, of course. During Jung-min's birth, you weren't there. I was giving birth by myself, and I was so hurt. It felt like I was all alone in this world, I just wanted to die. I hated you so much. Oh man... Worse than a teenager! What? I mean, I'm such a terrible husband. Then you showed up the next day after a stakeout, and slept like a baby, and snored! I deserve a spot in hell... I should be worshipping you for putting up with me. Now I understand why you gave up. And whose fault is that? You looked so gentle in that old photo. What photo? You know, the one taken at the concert. Concert? You still carry that photo around? Why didn't you burn it? You said you regret that we ever met! Had I not gone to the concert, I'd not have met you! But... I'm sure I was sorry while living with you, and couldn't bring myself to say it. What's with you? Be your usual self. Honey. I'm sorry. Accept my apology. Don't do this, it's all over. I'll feel better if you hated me. What was that? Are you deaf? Wait... Water? Oh no! What's going on?! Thank you! For apologizing before we die! I'm sorry too! A middle age couple was rescued near Jamsil Bridge this afternoon. They were found handcuffed to each other, the man is IDed as a detective. The woman was adamant about her identity. I'm his wife! I'm his wife! The entire country saw that, you can't get divorced now. I don't remember anything... What happened to me? (When are we due in court tmrw?) What's with the text? And it was today, you bastard! Life is a series of endless competition. - And he's falling behind. - Stop it. Only his appetite consoles his loneliness. But we cannot wait any longer! So we decided to kickstart 'Project Marry My Teacher'! Mr. Ahn! Profess your love! We'll help you! Look this way! - Stop eating! - What are you doing?! So please get married ASAP! Like that's ever going to work. His appetite is amazing. It's Mal-hee's teacher! Now I'm him?! You fat boar! What do I do?! Hey! Is this your living room? You caught you. I received a tip. A tip? About what? That you went to an abortion clinic. Is that true? Well, I... it's technically true, but it wasn't for me. Then who? I can't tell you that, let's say it was for me. You're quite loyal. What? But who was the tipper? Fox Mulder! Ghost? I got you! My acting's getting good, eh? I may just become a pro at this rate. Holy shit! - What was that for! - Why're you in his body? I dunno, but I'm always hungry. Wanna get some burger? Burger? Yeah? I'm late! Come with me, I'll buy you one. Yeah? - I want 2! - Okay! Good bye! So are you like a cupid or something? The thing is, I almost ended Mal-hee's relationship. Then what is it? Is it all just random? After seeing Mal-hee and Yo-sep, fighting to keep their love, I wanted to protect Det. Park's family too. Like a sense of duty. It's true, there's no end to learning. I even learn something from a ghost. Stop eating, no more. - I'm not a ghost. - Don't be so certain. Hey! What's the deal with the part-time job? I thought your family was well off. We are! I'm short on my research fund. What research? (Dangerous Science) Welcome! "Dangerous Science"? She's definitely not normal. Lovely Da-in: I miss you What's this? Lovely Da-in misses the fat boar? Then make it happen. Why is this so good? Hi! It's unbelievable! I lost faith in humanity! He's playing way above his weight. It's like going after Jennifer Lawrence. How could an educator be so immoral? Maybe she has a debt? Or terminally ill? So she's losing grip with reality. Nothing else makes sense. Let's proceed though. This hair is a lost cause! Yoo Jae-ha: Because I Love You This place reminds me of our college days, right? Yeah. You got drunk and came onto me during my freshman year. I was a crazy ass. What? What I'm saying is, I'm sorry. You puked by the overpass and I was patting your back. I've never seen you unable to hold in food. Is that right? I don't remember those days very well... I guess I was nasty. How could you not remember that day? When a person... wants to forget something, he does so subconsciously. You wanted to forget it that much? Well... You proposed to me. Sorry! Is it on you?! - It's okay! - Jesus Christ! It's okay! I asked you a question! Why did you want to forget it? If I was still single after 30, you wanted to marry me. This fat boar is no joke! Um... I just felt bad! Think about it! A girl so beautiful! You'd be hitched so fast! I was piss drunk and went for it. You weren't drunk at all. No? You regularly sent me flowers, and drank penalty drinks for me. Even serenaded me with a song on the field trip. - A song? - Yeah. Yeah! What are you looking at? Gonna wear a mask on the stage? It's my choice. Hyun-kyoung, it must be pretty serious. That's why I said I'm giving up. I'm hopeless. Your voice is too good to give up. Such a beautiful day. Hyun-kyoung. Don't take this the wrong way, let's go to a clinic. Of the singers I know, so many of them had stage frights. They all got treated and perform beautifully. Clinic? As in psych ward? Oh come on... Leave the stereotype behind. Must I do such a thing? That's like killing me twice. Another beer? At your place. So pretty. You're prettier... (Scully) Your call cannot be connected... Not gonna answer? Answer if you want. Ghost, where are you?! I don't need a loan. I'm drunk, so drunk. You're drunk. My belly is so round. This isn't my belly. - Yu-don. - Yeah? Got any comfy clothes? Clothes... Let's see... I'm so drunk. Should I rest here for a bit? Seriously? Is this happening? You must've saved the world in your past life. I just need to play cupid for you, right? Since it turned out this way, let's do this, Mr. Ahn. (Q2 Sales List) Ahn Yu-don, math, grade 12. Mr. Ahn, you feel bad? How can I help? If it was you, what'd you do? You're up? I'm making hangover soup. I must've fallen asleep. Probably tired. Sit, it's almost ready. Okay. You remembered? I always ordered egg rolls whenever we went drinking. You still remember that I like this. It's really nothing... Does it taste bad? Things change... Things change with time. I had so many dreams. I never thought I'd be selling textbooks. Bad, right? Things went bad, everything. But your innocence... is still the same. Oh yeah, your cup... What the hell? Eh? - Mrs. Kim Gap-soon. - Where am I? What is it? Kim Gap-soon? What's going on? Who is this granny? Tell me I'm not her! A granny is too much, gramps! Just let me out of here! What's too much at our age? Want some persimmon? I don't want no persimmon! I want out of this body! I can't do this anymore! No more! I want to find myself! Seriously! Gap-soon! This is really bad... Who are you, by the way? Me? I'm your first love Choon-ho. You forgot that too? First love? What's with you? You'll hurt yourself. Hold still! You said you're my first love! Honey! Hey! This is nuts, I'm at my wits' end. I'm a granny! How can senile seniors fall in love? What if I'm stuck here? - Must be dementia. - Or multiple personality. Yeah! Holy cow! So many wrinkles. So deep too. - Shut it! - Gap-soon! Who are you? Her first love, say hi. First love... Good afternoon. She's my grandchild. It's over if you play cupid for him? No... He's her first love, so I even kissed, but nothing. Kiss? She must have another man. Love is in the air! Shut it! Remember I said I may have been a musician? Yeah. Don't know my name or anything else, but I'm certain of some things. Yeah? A man, in music, and an audition judge. I could dig around. Can you? I'll look into audition judges angle. Okay, I'll be in your debt. Possess Brad Pitt's body, then. Shut it! Wait a minute! Wait! Are you okay? Yes? - I have a question. - What is it? - Are you sure? - About what? That you are you. You may not know me, but I know me, happy? Okay, nicely done. - Sir! - Hey. I had a meeting with producer Kim. I see. How's Lee-hyung? Same old. How could he have gotten into such accident? I hope we don't lose another star in the music industry. - Who's at the hospital? - Hyun-kyoung. Huh? Lee-hyung... Hyun-kyoung? - Ghost, can you leave? - Why? I think I found you. Seriously?! Ma'am, please don't do this! Let go! I have to go find myself! We gave her sedatives, she'll calm down soon, please keep an eye on her. - Thank you. - No problem. Are you okay? Do I look okay? I'm so tired... So why try to flee? You never used to do that. Mind your business. But it is my business. Snap out of it, Mr. Choon-ho! I have another man! Who got to you? A womanizer? Same for you too, you lied about first love. It's too old for that. You probably lived happily until you became a widower. When will you ever understand me? Gramps. Do you like me that much? How many times must I tell you? Then can you grant me a wish? A wish? I'm good! Get in! - You okay? - Let's move! Sure, sure. What's he doing? Step on it! Come on! Okay. You don't look so good, something wrong? You too, what's not wrong at our age? - Where to? - University Street! Aren't we youthful today. Look out! Gramps, what's wrong? Gramps! Gramps! Pardon me, I'm so sorry about this. I didn't know what condition he was in. Looks like he's quite ill. Could you stop crying? You're making me feel bad. I said I'm sorry, I was in a hurry... Please, mom. Mom? Please snap out of it, mom! Pull yourself together! Honey, you really don't recognize me? One more. Just one, Gap-soon. You can't have dementia. Your smile is radiant today. You're prettier when you smile. Honey, I'm sorry... A long time ago, I couldn't deliver your letter for Choon-ho, I just couldn't, no, I didn't. I cared so deeply for you. I'm sorry. Honey, they say I'm very ill. But I'm getting greedy. For the sin I committed, even if you mistake me for him... Choon-ho! I'll live the rest of my life as him if it makes you happy. But still... Could you recognize me just once more? Hush now... I got up early to get all dolled up, how do I look? You're always the prettiest. Yeah? Who am I? Kim Gap-soon, of course. Then who are you? I'm Choon-ho, your first love. You're not Choon-ho, you swindler. You're my husband. Do you recognize me? Thank you. I've been wanting to say this before my time's up. I'm so sorry, the truth is... Hubby, it's not your fault. Our fate brought us together, it's not your fault. Thanks for recognizing me... Sorry for breaking your heart at our age. Honey... Why... are you there? I'm right here, but why are you there? Honey! Listening to this now, it'd be better to arrange it lightly like you said. That's Ghost? And that's Hyun-kyoung? Should I be glad that I found him? Didn't touch the lunchbox? Good afternoon. Have you eaten? I brought a sandwich. I munched on some snack. When he wakes up, he'll scold me for starving you. Lee-hyung, wake up now. Can't you see how hard it is on her? You'll wake up for sure. This girl, and this feeling... It's nice. It's nice... but rather than monotonous, how about light and upbeat? That'd be comical. I'm a big shot producer. What happened to the humbleness you preached? You're so cheerful lately. In a few months, there will be an important open audition, do you want to try it? You want to put me back on the stage? Aren't you scared? What if I pass out again? We can do it together. Me on the piano, and you on vocal. Love can be cured with love. Same with stage fright. But I'm scared, baby... Nothing to be scared of! You're Hyun-kyoung, the legendary busker! Wait, did you call me "baby"? Nope. I could swear you said that. Wait... Hyun-kyoung... Hyun-kyoung! What's wrong? Hyun-kyoung! Chan-young! Wake up. Please... What's going on here? Wake up! Please stop, what are you doing?! Ghost? Honey! Wait! Are you okay? Everyone you possessed were at the accident. I see... So that's it. That woman, is that Hyun-kyoung? Did you really love her? Hyun-kyoung... The stars are so pretty. You're prettier. Why do you put up with me? I'm nothing. Hyun-kyoung... I... really... like you. Where are we going now? I need you to act. What is it? Give this to Hyun-kyoung. Say you went to my home and found it. What's this? Leave that and do it properly. Lee-hyung's cousin? Yes. I had a double eyelid surgery. I think he wrote this for you. (Because I Love You - Hyun-kyoung ver.) And... this... I think he bought this for you. What?! Ring? What should I do? Can I really sing? Can I fulfill your wish? If I sing... will you wake up? You're so dead. You'll thank me later. You owe me a choco milk. More like back of my hand! Baby! What's wrong? Ghost? Hey! Lee-hyung! Hey! Firing! Charge it again! One, two, three! One, two, three! I think Yoo's still around, connecting people with love. Really? Are you serious? Yes, please make sure he can see it. Yeah? There isn't much time left. But your talent isn't going anywhere. If you maintain your voice... Thank you, Hyun-kyoung... But why are you like this? We barely know each other. I got excited thinking about helping Lee-hyung. Could I ask you a favor? Let me accompany you. Let's play together. Me on the piano, and you on vocal. Don't take it the wrong way, I want to do something for my friend too. #15. Standby please. Good luck! Good luck! Be strong. Love... can be cured with love. Same... with stage fright. Shall we? #15, Ms. Lee Hyun-kyoung? Yes. You're playing Yoo Jae-ha? 'Because I Love You.' Are you ready? Break a leg! The first time I felt your gaze, was it just my own misunderstanding? With your bright smile, you made me into a fool Hyun-kyoung, you're doing well. And my accident wasn't your fault. You had nothing to do with it. It's just fate. Hyun-kyoung, thank you for granting my wish. I loved you, love you, and always will. For coming back to me, I will give you everything Forever in this way, we will never be apart Because I only love you Thank you. Ghost... You were good to me, I become smaller only with time No matter what it means, I will follow you Yesterday... Hyun-kyoung... I... really... like you. I was part of you For coming back to me, I will give you everything Forever in this way, we will never be apart Because I only love you only you Ghost didn't appear after that day. Not once. Because a miracle that can't be scientifically explained happened. Look, it's granny, she looks better. My teacher's all lovey-dovey. Wait, she was a boy? Mal-hee went to Seoul U and had a baby. She's a smart gal. Why did Ghost possess Chan-young? He was never at the scene of the accident. You may deny it, but I think you possessed him for the sake of your love. A journey through music, I'm All That Music's Lee Seung-yeol, good evening, everyone. Our first guest is a rising star, who is receiving much love from us all. They say you fall in love when you hear her voice. I hope you fall in love as well. Lee Hyun-kyoung, let's welcome her! Hello there, I'm Lee Hyun-kyoung. I'll be singing "Love Is A Word" composed by Jin Lee-hyung. If you'll stay with me, even a fool will do So warm, you're so dear to me I finally found a calling, I'll write in my journal Her voice is so pretty. Of course, that's my girl. Ghost? Been a while, Scully, you're all grown up. Congrats on the college acceptance. You're a piece of work. They say love trumps friendship, you never answered my calls. You got nothing left to lose, eh? Sorry, I've been busy with work and love. You're still my BFF. Are you happy? Yeah, to death. Thank you, Scully, it's all thanks to you. I love you Someone may be jealous of us Let bygones be bygones Even if we don't know what love is, perhaps this is love Even after a long day, I will love you unconditionally I love you A tribute to Yoo Jae-ha
