Studio SLON Truemen Pictures With the support of the Ministry of culture of the Russian Federation Sabina Eremeeva, Natella Krapivina present Great, we can keep our shoes on. Go and turn the water off. You going far, Vanya?! I can see you. That's it, dude. Let go of the WC. - I didn't want to. - Calm down. Get down. I miss you. I miss you. - Let go of the WC. - I miss you. Take it easy... Calm down. You just weren't here! You just weren't here! Hold him tight! Filipp Avdeev Alexander Kuznetsov A film by Alexander Gorchilin ACID I think it's got bigger. What do you think? How would I know? Never seen it before. Sasha... I mustn't. Oh, Sasha - why not? - I just can't. It's impossible. - Sasha, please... - Sasha... - I can't. - But I want you. - I can't at the moment. If you want to jump - jump. - Hello. - Hello. It was fear. His head was bursting with thoughts going round and round never stopping... Better he drunk vodka. Careful, careful... Don't lower it down! How will he come out? Vanya, what were you doing? You'll lie there forever, eh? Come on, darling, let's go, please... They were joking, that's all. Let's go, darling. Get up, I've brought you some cranberries... Just tell him! Of course, you're good lads. All of you. But he couldn't have done it himself. - He just couldn't... - Why couldn't he? He could have! Definitely! Did you really know anything about him? How much he weighed at birth, about his first tooth... About the music he listened to, whom he loved, whom he borrowed money from? And later you're surprised! And he shagged her... her... - And even him over there! - Pete, let's go. She brought some cranberries... Why the hell cranberries?! Pete, stop it! If I've said anything wrong, then I'm sorry! Pete! Pete. Could I? - Hello! How's it going? - OK. Who are you?! - I'm Vasilisk. - Sasha. - Two whiskies! - Five whiskies and I'm paying! OK. - Are you a Mohammedan? - Moham-- what? - I mean, are you a Muslim? - In what sense? People are saying that you've been circumcised. - Who says that? - No problem, everything's cool. I realise you did it as an artist, right? I'm an artist as well. Will you let me take a photo of it? What for? It interests me just as an art object, you know? An art object. Why are you telling everyone about my prick? - What? - About my prick! - Your prick? - Yeah, about the circumcision. Just helping you to be interesting. - What? - Be interesting! For you! Be interesting! At least in some way! Hey, Muslim! Muslim! Hurry up! They will all burn in hell! There's a special circle for them there. Take this. - What's this? - Just what we need. Come on. Guys, hold on! You're all so beautiful! But that's not the end of our celebration! Let's go back to my place! Ingenious! I've never seen anything like that. Here you are. It was my father who made all these sculptures. But I turn them into modern art. We take a pioneer. Here it is. Then we take some acid. There, on the top. Right! Perchloric acid. So that the concentrated acid doesn't damage the bath, we pour water into it. Pour out some acid. We take the pioneer... and we dip it. The acid solution reacts with hydrogen cations. As a result, we end up... with a disintegrated pioneer. - And what does it mean? - Doesn't mean anything. It'll be sold. First, you become a provocateur. And then a rich and famous artist. That's all. Nothing magical about it. No magic at all... Sasha, Pete. The other way round. Is there any difference? I can't! Why didn't you tell me you were coming? - Hello, mum. - Well, how are you? Would you let me in? - Is Sasha in? - Yes. He's asleep. I'll go and wake him. No need to wake anyone. Let him sleep. Sasha, where are you off to? Your mother's arrived. Didn't you recognize her? Perhaps he didn't. It's all right, he will later. I'm your mother. Hello, son. Hello. Hey! Sasha! He's run off. - I'll go and catch him. - No need, mum! We'll have a talk later. What are you having for breakfast? Rissoles. So what's wrong with rissoles? Elena, what's wrong with rissoles? - They've got meat in them, mum. - So what? I don't eat meat. Have you come for Pete Tikhomirov? - To see Pete? - Yes. He has a burn. Medicines have been prescribed. He's on a strict diet. He's to be seen at 8.00 a.m. in three days. Hello, how're you? I've got all the papers. Here's a statement, prescriptions, what medicines you need to buy. In three days you have to come back to be examined. I looked things up on the Internet... You're not the first case like this. You were lucky. Everything could have been a great deal worse. Pete, my mother's returned. I'm mad about it. She just arrived, without telling us. I'll have a talk with her, explain everything... Then you can come to me straight away. Maybe you should go home, if only for a couple of days. Forgive me, really. I'll have a word with her... Pete... Pete, are you mad at me? You don't want to talk, or you've lost your voice? I'll come in with you. How will you explain it? Fine... Is it true that you drank it by accident? OK, I'll call in a few days. Well, how are things in your Bangladesh? Cambodia. OK, Cambodia. You know, everything's really good. Great. So you don't eat meat anymore? Yeah. For three or four months now. - What's in your head? - Mum, d'you want to talk to us? - Sit here. - No, not really... Oh, no, I won't... Did Pete live with you? - With me? - Well, yes, with you. Isn't that right? - Yeah... for a bit. - Really? Grandma said two months. Two and a half. About that. He just had a row there with all his family. - So I brought him here. - Why you? - Because no one else took him. - Is he a good person? Yeah, he's my friend. So you found out I was returning, and you sent your friend back home? Yes. Because I'm afraid of you. Just look how much there is left over. Now I'm going to collect it all up. I think I'll sell it. Or maybe it's best to throw it away. Yeah, it's probably best just to throw it out. Try it on. It's funny that you came. Seems a good fit. Today Vanya and I were going to give in our application. To Marriage Registry. Pete! He went to IKEA for some chairs, but didn't find them. He was late for Karina. So my mother sent me to get her... In my opinion, that's a good enough reason to kill him. You don't feel sorry for him? For him? - Your stepfather. - That's his duty. He's a man, he's got a car. Karina! Come out! - Why take Karina? - What d'you mean, Sasha? Have you gone mad? She's a child. She's only 15. She's a ninja. Ready... Go! Sasha, why are you deceiving me? It doesn't hurt anymore. When I sit down it doesn't hurt. What about when it's erect? I don't get an erection. Hurry up! Hello! Come on, I'll carry it. - I thought it would be heavier. - Should I carry it? Why do you go off? I really didn't mean that. What did you just say? You could've called an Uber. I could have called an Uber? - Uber? Really, Sasha! - Why are you yelling? - I advertise Uber! - Vika, enough... Should I call a husband for an hour? What're you talking about? What husband? You know very well how delicate the female body is. - And the human body in general. - Vika, shut up! Sasha. Please give her bag back to her! And you go in front, and keep quiet! Dear friend, is that you? You sent me a text. I'm asleep. Hey! Where are you going? You wrote that you'd be coming. But I didn't reply that it's OK! I was asleep. Splendid. This is only the second time in my life that I've met you. So why am I to blame for the fact that you drank some acid? You'll have to leave in any event. I don't owe you anything. "I've got problems". We all have problems. But that doesn't mean you can stay here. Take your problems to your mother and father! - Gran! - Be quiet. She's asleep, she had a long flight. What's the time in Asia now? Acclimatisation... Gran... What? You're sexy! Is that the way to talk to your grandma? - What's wrong? It's true! - That's it. Shut up and keep quiet. Gran, I just told the truth, that's all... All right, then. But a fool is a fool. Here you are. - What it is? - A solution for your willy. Go to the bathroom, take your trousers down, and put it in there. - I'm not doing that. - Yes, you are, you'll put it there. - Gran, don't bother me! - Be quiet, your mother's asleep. I'm not doing that! D'you hear me? - Are you holding it? - Yes, I am. Did you know that she was flying back? She always returns at this time. For your father's sake. Well, she comes every year a day before... I really don't understand why we go there. He has no grave. But he isn't there either: the place where he disappeared. Sasha, she has no choice. Where else would you go? She was going to the village shop... Yeah, I know all about that. She came out, but he wasn't there. And the shop is no longer there. Nothing is left. And your friend disappeared, he doesn't come round to see us... Turn around, eh? - Am I embarrassing you? - Gran, turn around now, please. - Mitya, hello. - I'll take the picture. - Where're you going? - Leave off. - Why don't you say anything? - Get off me, I said! What happened?! Did I do something to you? - Where's the picture? - What picture? - Mine. - I won't give you any picture. Mitya, what's going on?! Wait! - Take your hands off! - Mitya! What's happened? Mitya! I've only just seen you for the first time. Hello. Now I'll show you a trick. The coin trick. Disappearing and appearing. Look, the coin's here, once again it's gone. So where's the coin? Behind your ear. Behind your ear? There's nothing there. Behind your collar? Nothing there either. D'you know where it is? I'll take a look in your pocket. In your pocket... There it is! You're so tough! Yes, I love it! I love it... Here's the coin. Pete. Pete... My boyfriend left me today. You can stay over if you want to. I don't mind. Good afternoon. Is Pete in? Good afternoon. Is Peter in? Pete's not here. Isn't he staying with you? No, he's not at my place. Do you know where he is? No. Do you? I've written to him, called him. He doesn't answer. OK, I'm sorry. Sasha, may I ask you something? What do you want from my son? I don't need anything from Pete. So why have you come round, if you don't need anything? Just leave him in peace! Give him the chance to return to normal life. Normal life? What kind of a normal life is that? We aren't like you, d'you understand? No, I don't. And you don't understand your own son. Get out of here! I don't want to see you again. I don't think you'll ever see anyone here again. Go away, or I'll set the dog on you! - Do that! - I'll count to three. Do you need help with it? One! Two! Sasha, go away, will you? I'll go. But afterwards don't yell at the coffin that you loved him. That he couldn't have done it, that you brought him some cranberries. That won't help. No, well, if I said something wrong?! I apologise! Is it good? It is. Right? Why do I agree with you all the time? No, it doesn't taste good! Your girlfriend wrote to me. Vika? She wrote to me: Elena, I'm so glad that you've come back. Let's meet and have a chat... - How did she find out? - On Facebook. I don't like her at all. Neither do I. But I don't know how to put her off. Aren't you gay? Your grandma and I were just talking about it. It seemed that way to us. I won't change her mind, let her think about it how she thinks. Otherwise she'll get confused. So why do you love your Pete so much? Why "love"? You say: "love, love, love". Why? You do everything for him, you help him. Of course I help him. I don't want people to say bad things about me. I want to be such a good guy, you understand? That's all it is, it's your female upbringing. I can't send any woman to hell. I can't send anyone to hell. I have no will, you see? I'm weak-willed! There's a very simple method. Just the one word: "No". No, and that's it. Hey. Vika's not in. What? Vika's not here. She's not? She hasn't come from the beauty parlor yet. - Nail polish and stuff. - I see. Call her. I have, but she doesn't pick up. I see. That means she's doing it on purpose so that everyone's waiting for her. D'you want to wait here? I'll wait downstairs. I've got a key to the roof. So are you really going to marry her? What? Vika said that you're going to marry her. Yeah, sure. Don't do it. Then she'll die of rage. You love her that much? No. It's just that she's sort of... stupid. - And what sort are you? - I don't know. Just like this. Tell me what sort I am. - Hey, get down. - What sort am I? I don't know. You're funny. Come on, get down. - Anything else? - That's enough. - Tell me! - That's it, get down! You're so boring. Are you really circumcised? Yeah, she told me about that as well. Yeah, I really am circumcised. Well then, show me. Fine. Have a look. I was joking, put it away! Send me a picture later. Listen, now it might look a bit strange. There you are. Yeah, it is strange. An artist made it. I'll give it a Like. That's all, I'm going. Wait! Close your eyes. It hurts! It hurts for the first five seconds. Then you get used to it. Is it OK now? - Yeah, OK. - That's how you get used to Vika. Just like with the clothes peg. OK, then. Off you go. Excuse me... Do you work here? Yes, but I don't answer questions. Can I help you? I've murdered someone. What? I've killed someone. - Have you got your passport? - Yes. Let's go, then. Lyuba?! Lyuba?! Lyuba. - Lyuba... - Dance, dance! Lyuba, what's happened? The cops came round. They said Pete murdered Vanya. I know. He wrote to me from the detention centre. - Why did they come round? - They examined the balcony. Why? They wanted to find out about Vanya. I'm gathering up his things to sell. Try it on! Try it for size. And that one as well! Sasha, come on! I've begun to like Pete a lot. I thought: If I can't have Vanya, Pete would do. Fancy, if I got married to him, I'd be the wife of a murderer. What are we going to do now? Why should we do anything? He murdered someone, so let him pay for it. We didn't know him. D'you know what he used to tell me about you? What? That you're a fool. And that you're a bad musician. And that he doesn't know how to get rid of you. I'm sorry, it's better you should know than not, right? Let him die. Sasha! - Pete's in... - I know where Pete is. I want to thank you. Now I definitely don't have a son. I had hopes. Now they're gone. I want to talk to his father. Well, go on, then. Couldn't he help? He's some sort of high-up there, isn't he? Yes, a real high-up. Talk to him. - How? - I haven't the faintest idea. So how can I talk to him? Sasha, excuse me please, I have to go to work. Some people go to work to put food on the table. - Just tell me where to find him! - Just tell him that he's rubbish! I'll tell him. I promise. Give me his address. That's an interesting story, young man. Of course, I knew he was a moron, but not to that extent. - Mr. Tikhomirov... - What's with "Mr. Tikhomirov"? I just don't understand how Pete could think that I'd buy all this crap. Let me see it. How much? I don't know. Well, you come asking for money and you don't know how much? So how much do you want yourself? I don't understand... I'm his friend. Look: you got yourself involved in this case because you want your share out of it as an intermediary. So let me pay that share right away, and that'll be it. Fine, I'm going. Hospital discharge sheet... Why is it a copy? I can bring the original. I don't know. D'you want real money? Listen, I really don't want anything. I mean, I don't want... In brief, I thought that this statement would help with the police. Don't storm off, sit down. OK. Very well. Let's start from the beginning. First, someone falls out of a window. And you have nothing to do with it. Second, Pete drinks some acid. Also, as if for no reason. Third, he goes to the police and gives himself up. Right? Well, yeah. And I have to sort everything out to help my son... who, in fact, thinks nothing of me. But it doesn't matter. I don't know. And likewise I don't know, please explain why should I help? Just remind me, I kinda forgot... Well, he's your son. That's it. And could've remained a sperm. Any other reason? Yes... He's lost his voice. And I've lost my umbrella. D'you want to hear about that? D'you know why you have nothing to say? Because you don't believe it. Because it's one thing to cover for a friend, and another thing - rubbish. It's you who's rubbish. What? I was asked to pass that on to you. I've done so. Mum... I had a drink... I'll go. You see, I'm not even Karina's father. Her mother started it: go on and do something. I'm sorry, but I don't really know what's happened. - How do I describe it... - Just do it. - He showed her his dick... - His dick? Wait a moment. Everything will be clear. Here it is. But I warn you right away... My God... Poor lad. That's the kind of... poor lad he is. That's Sasha. Please behave like a man, will you? Don't worry. - Hello. - Hello. Don't bother to take your shoes off. Come in. How are you? I'm Sasha. You bastard, the hell have you done?! I'll put you away for seducing her. Get the hell away from here! That's all. I won't do it again. I just had to. Good bye. Sasha... Here, take this. - Mum, what's that? - It's water from Jordan... - We don't need that! - He's the spit and image of his father! Now you see? Look at him! Well, what are you doing?! Do you drink moonshine, then?! Sasha! Have you any cigarettes? You're a smoker. Do you really remember nothing? How we used to live here. There was a pond here. You used to go for walks with your dad here. No, I don't remember. No doubt it was great here. No, I mustn't smoke. It's a weakness. I'm pregnant. Cool. Congratulations. Thanks. Where will he live? I mean, the child. I don't know. He hasn't been born yet. When are you due? In seven months. If I have it... Well, try doing it somehow. What do you think, should I have it? I don't know. Ask Grandma. She's a woman, more or less. Discuss it with her, how to... I know how and in what way. I gave birth to you, Sasha. I've already asked Grandma. Naturally, she says "keep it." D'you want me to tell you something different? Why so severe? Will this child also have no father? Hello. The training session? I've come today... To pick you up. From the training session. The session's been cancelled, see. Shall we go? It's my music. Yes, I realise. No, you don't. I wrote it myself. Sasha... - Sasha! - What? I love you. I love you too. Really? Sasha, there's blood. It's from me. No, it's from me. Well... What is it this time? A problem... We arrived an hour earlier. - And they were banging. - What of it? The fact that Karina is 15. She'll turn 16 in a week. You're bothered about one week? How clever you've become. And how old were you the fist time? - What do you... - The banging. - It's not about me. - Now they all do it earlier. Please don't rattle the sugar bowl. I'm sorry. What profession will he have? - What's he interested in? - Music. So, a musician... He's out there, in my car. - Who? - Your son. How did he get to be with you? I grabbed him when they were coupling. - I'll call the police right now. - Go ahead. You're holding my son! What right have you, eh?! - Who the hell are you?! - Sit down. - What d'you want from me? - Sit down, woman! - I'll kill you right now! - Oh, God... How could that happen... You've destroyed everything: all my practices, meditation... I even said I'd kill you... God... I can't go on, I need to get out of here... It's a nightmare... You must understand... I'm tired of all this myself. And my wife insists on me doing it. And I want to die. You're able to cry, - but I'm not allowed even to do that. - You have a little cry. As they say, it's against the rules. I won't do anything to him. I'm obliged just to give him a tap. A little tap. - But not hard. - No, no, not his face. Like that, to his side. OK? OK. Elena, are you leaving? Already? - Mum, I won't be long. - With this man? I'm only going downstairs. That's all. - And who will take care of it? - What? - My grave, Elena. - What grave, mum? I can. Keep an eye on it. We'll be quick. - She's also like that? - What? My mother's been like that. Doesn't understand anything. Senility. What senility? She understands everything perfectly well. It's you who's senile. Excuse me. He's there. Did you switch the heater on for him? Get out. Mum. Mum! Did you see it? Did you see it? What did you think? Yes, I'm scarier than you! Yes, I'm angrier than you! I'm more terrible than all of you! - Sasha! - Get off my back! - Sasha! - You just shut up, will you! Why have you come? To see how things are with you. Things are fine with me. And how are things with you? Not bad. You've got your voice back? Yes, good medicines. Cool. I also like it more. Is it true... Well, is it true that you... I told him: "If you want to jump - jump". And he did. I see. What about me being a bad musician, did you say that? I don't remember. Are you really a musician? Who you really are? Sasha, I don't think about that. It's not important. So what is important? That's what I came to tell you. We've known each other for a long time, we're friends. A familiar bottle. I just wanted to keep it there in a friendly way. Suddenly you might want some more. After all, we're friends. D'you know what our problem is, Sasha? The fact that we have no problems. Someone gets everything and brings it to us. That's why we just sit and think - who am I? What am I capable of? What can we give to the world, besides an iPhone charger? Is that it? Have you said everything, or is there more to come? Tomorrow I'm going to church. If you want, we can go together. Has a sense of humour appeared with your voice? Vasilisk has had a child. He asked me to be the godfather. - Vasilisk had a child, eh? - Yes. - But he's a... - Yes. So what? Well, it's... What is it? Improper, not nice? Vasilisk-- he's different, sure. I've talked a lot with him. And my father-- I've also talked with him. For the first time in several years. And my mother... Even my mother... When this happened she went to him and asked him to help. - Your mother? - Yes, my mother. Listen, is there anyone else in this list of yours? Yes, of course. You. Thank you. Otherwise, why would I have come here, Sasha? I don't know. It seems to me to talk about everything that's good. No. I came here to help you. Listen, just shut up. - I came here to help you. - No, Pete. You see, it was I who went to your father and asked him to help. When your mother found out that you were at the police station, she just went calmly to work. And where were you when I needed... just to talk with you? When I asked you to listen to my music? Just to put headphones on. Where were you? And now you come to me and say that I'm not living right, yeah? You remember everything that you said about me. You're just lying. Forgive me. I want to listen to your music. - Thanks. - Really. I want to listen to it. One. One-two... Now it's five in the morning. Three hours you've been asleep, and one hour as I talked to your mother. We talked about you, Sasha. Who else could it be... While I've been writing this message, all the music projects on your computer have been sent to the recycle bin. Do you remember in the first year you were called out to the blackboard arid asked to read a word and you got stuck. You we pursing your lips into a little trump and tried to pronounce it. At that moment I thought: what a moron he is. I'll make friends with this guy. Sasha, you're my friend. And I tell you honestly: you're no musician. I've deleted your music so as to help you. It's time for you... Can you help me? - Me? - Yes, you. Thank you. Will the baptism be here? Yes, here. Right here. And they do it to the child right here... Well, that is, it's... They christen him. Yes, right here. Christen... And where do you get the holy water from? What d'you mean? Do they bring it from somewhere or do you buy it? We get it from the tap, and the priest does the baptism. That's holy water for you. Father Dmitry, you know... Please look, I've brought a little shirt. You can see it's not very white. Is it important, or will a different shade do? And I also have a question about the cross. I've heard that the cross should be simple and humble... But how simple and humble should it be? Show me the child, and not the shirt or the cross. Yes, we have the child with us. What are you doing here? Good morning. Pete called me. Where is he? - I thought he was with you. - That means he's late. We can't do it today without him. Is it possible to baptise a child? - What if he doesn't want it? - Yes, it's possible. You can decide for others? That as well. Father Dmitry, here, accept this, so to say, as a gift from us. - Please... - Oh, I thank you. I shall place it in the children's room. The children here will quickly decorate it. - They won't know if it's an angel or not. - Children... Let them do as they please. For that is how art begins. Art, indeed. And sin also begins like that. What's up, haven't you started yet? Pete. I'm not late, am I? Father Dmitry, this is our Godfather, Pete. Are you baptised, a believer? Yes. Because even a good atheist cannot become a Godfather. The task of a Godfather is to help the child to grow in faith. - You cannot replace him... - We don't intend to change him. - Change? - If you suddenly fall by the wayside, become defiled in some way. Then you will have to pray for him. We will pray in any event. It's time to begin. Take him. Yes, that's right - in your hands. Higher up, higher. Hold his head. Support his head. Yes, that's good. In the scriptures it is written: Whosever is not born of water and of the Spirit... shall not enter the Kingdom of God... And further: "He who has faith and is baptised shall be saved. But he who has not faith shall be condemned." Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. I believe in One God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in One Lord, Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father of all ages, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, through Whom all things were made. You renounced Satan and all his works, and all his angels and his pomps. - I renounce them. - Do you renounce Satan? - I renounce him. - And blow and spit upon him. How? Do you associate yourself to Christ? I do. - Do you associate yourself to Christ? - I do. Let us bow before him. Let us bow before the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and the Trinity inseparable and indivisible. Alexander, a servant of God, is anointed with the oil of joy in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. For hearing the faith, in healing the body and the soul Your hands created me and gave me life. To follow in Your footsteps. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. This servant of God Alexander is now baptised. Are you sick, or something? Get lost! Who's he with? You? He's with me. Tell your friend he should see a doctor. - Father Dmitry... - What? Fetch a cloth! DEDICATED TO MUMS AND DADS
