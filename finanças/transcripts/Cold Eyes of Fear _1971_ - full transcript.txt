Get up. Well, that's quality. - Awesome. There is one more. Not quite my style, but whatever. Everyone has their own taste. You have to find this... Health. - Health. How about we put on a show? I'm sorry. - Silly. This dress cost me 35 pounds. Clean it with hot water. - I... In the women's toilet? - Yes. Goodbye. Grouille, he sees us coming. From where ? - This way. Wait for me, you rednecks. Anna! Where did this bitch go? Anna, where are you? Shit, at the end. The slut. I will wring his neck. - Oh, he's buggering off. Come on, let's go. - OKAY. No, inspector. It is quiet. - I need to talk to you. One moment, sir. - As you want. I arrested all the suspects. I understand. You said ? - I'm looking for a little... We were together. Provided a drunkard hasn't... Anna. Its good. I will try to find her. - That's it. No. - Good. Follow me. OK. - Oh good ? OKAY. Don't be stupid, Hawkins. You surely have a girlfriend waiting for you. I understand, Mr. Peter. But... - I'm coming. But the judge demands that I stay here. He works all night. He won't notice anything. I need solitude, do you get it? - Yes yes. It's just that if your uncle finds out... - Thank you. What is happening ? - Minute. The gate is closed, as usual. Mamma mia. - Let's go behind. This way. Where are we going ? - Come. Whose house is it? - It's so quiet here. You will see. It's here, in my opinion. - You think ? You know where we're going, I hope? - You are scared ? Hold on. - Let's see. Does the house belong to you? - If only... But I have the key, that's the main thing. Where is the light? Get off me, fool. You're scaring me. Sorry. Forgive me. This way, please. Make yourself at home. Ice cubes ? Excuse me. It takes me back. Pretty shack, isn't it? The owner must be Scottish. He stashed his whiskey. It's one of his quirks. Hola, gently. Stopped. Hold on, will you? Later. Are you crazy. I wasn't joking. The dress really costs 35 pounds. Really ? What do you want ? No. How do you say 'love'? - 'Love'. And 'whore'? - Nope. Well say it. 'Love'. 'Putana'. 'Love putana'. Hawkins. Who are you ? There's not a penny in the shack. Embark the silverware. From the dining room. But I am unarmed. There are no guns here. And then... I don't want any trouble. What are you doing here ? What do you want ? Sorry, honey. I don't like to upset the pros. A pro, you are one. Hat. What do you want from us? What do you want ? Asshole. What are you waiting for to kill us? Shut up. I am not in a hurry. Besides, you owe him money, man. You understand ? Listen to me... - Silence. Seated, both. It won't be for long. Don't move, you won't live. What are we waiting for ? - Sit down, my friend. Spanish, the doll? - Italian. What is your job ? Whore in exile? Provisional export product. - I only buy British. You are wrong. Do you like London? - I dunno. Toilets, darling. Gorgeous puppies. Be careful going along the basin. Woe if you fall into the shit. Where am I, according to you? I'm in deep shit. He is on the edge of the pot. Come, he says. I'll take you to a quiet place. Calm: He said it. And what do I see? An asshole like you. Line is busy ? - No, it sounds. Hello ? Judge Biddell's residence? - Yes. Hold the line. The judge is on the phone. Go ahead, sir. - Thank you. What a grump. - As usual, right? To fart ? You took your time. Where's Hawkins? He had to go to the movies. He's gaga, my word. He never goes to the cinema. I do not know what to say. - The truth. Did you send him to graze? Come on tell me. Who are you with ? - With no one, let's see. You surprise me. What are you doing here at this hour? It was a mess in town. One more demonstration. I didn't want it. Besides, I have the Enterprise file to investigate. It is plausible. Can you do without the strippers for a while? It will be fine. You are very good friends. I need you. Hello ? You still there ? - But yes. Are you at the club? - No, in court. I'll be back late, without specifying a time. That does not please me. You turned our house into you-know-what. Your taste is very vulgar. What happened ? - That's it, change the subject. The Maclennon affair takes a bad turn. There is a witness. But the trial starts tomorrow. - That's why I stayed. I have to read the whole file again. Task to find the case law. I need the Forsythe case. It was in 1938, I believe. - 38? I'll get you this. Let me know when you get it. Hello. You still there ? Sure. Is there someone at your house? - No, I'm telling you that I'm alone. I was thinking of books. They are near the south window. And then damn. Remind me when you find them. Heard. I remember you. - OKAY. I wish it was finally reasonable. Excuse me sir. - Yes ? The Maclennon File. - Thank you. How lucky I am here. I would have liked to see his papers. Everything is in order. Would you go through Newgate? It's on the way, yes. - Perfect. Would you do me a favor? - Certainly. You know my house, at 336 Kensington Road. I know where it is. - So much the better. Give this to my nephew, Peter Biddell. - Count on me. Thank you. - At your service. Are you getting this gibberish? - We have to. I am a lawyer. Lawyer. So explain to me why your uncle was talking about strippers? I handle the legal affairs of Enterprise Studios. There is a crisp series on TV. - It's all the same. The series ? - No, the lawyers. The mess, what. Besides, you piss me off. But yes. The successful lawyer, the real confident gentleman. Why does this book interest your uncle? It's for a civil proceeding. - Explain, Master? It's not a violent crime. - Oh good ? Don't move, bitch. Pick it up, will you? Do not move. Violent offense or not, idiots put everyone in jail. Why don't I take one down in the heap? Stopped. Who are you ? What do you want ? Do we know you? Is it because you don't know him that you're pissed off? Go ahead, kill him. Set the shack on fire. But me, you leave me alone. Leave me alone. Don't shout like that. I won't say anything. No one will know that I passed. It doesn't concern me, do you get it? I don't even know him. Neither seen nor known. - Stop yelling. I hate yelling. dirty cons. I will shoot you. Are you nervous? Take a walk, without me losing sight of you. Let me go. Shut up. Can I have a whisky? Please. Police. Police. No one comes in, the lawyer. It's understood ? Otherwise, I take it down. And you and the girl with. Ahead. Walk. I swear I'll shoot you. Walk. Good evening, Mr. Biddell. Is there something? No no. Can I help you ? - I bring you a letter. There's an assassin in the house. He killed Hawkins, the butler. He has a gun. - Your uncle's. A message ? No. Everything is fine. Thank you. An assassin, you understand? What are you waiting for to intervene? There is a... Is there anyone else? - Nope. But... - Later, ma'am. The domestic ? - Dead. What do you mean ? - His heart gave out. He collapsed. He was no longer very young. I hope you will forgive us. Sorry, lawyer. But violence is not my thing. You keep them in check, Quill. Put some wood in the fireplace, lawyer. We're going to talk. In the chimney. Who are you ? - Mystery and gumdrop. I'm looking for something and you'll help me find it. To help ? What do you mean ? What are you looking for ? Pick up... and don't be smart. Peter, the policeman came by? - Nope. Um yes. Is it yes or no ? - Yes, a moment ago. He gave you my letter? - Nope. Take. I had entrusted it to him. - He just passed. Read it. Do what I ask of you. Did you find the book? Hello ? No not yet. - Hurry up and call me back. Yes, my uncle. Ah that's right, the letter. I read it to you? 'Let this policeman's visit be a lesson to you.' 'Fire the whore...' Sorry, it's in the text. 'Fire the whore you get in our house. Your uncle.' Do you classify your letters? - Give me that. Your uncle is very angry, it seems. But you don't care, do you? It's the least of your worries. What book is he asking for? He put it on the table. Do you have to read it to him in full? No, just a few paragraphs on the Forsythe case. Don't make him wait. It might confuse him. What happens if I don't call him? He just might get suspicious and send a cop. A real one this time. - As dry as you'll be dead. Call him. Where's the other device? - In the corridor. I rely on your honor, lawyer. Do not disappoint me. I go to the hallway. Don't bullshit, understand? Aren't you mad, Peter? Provided you found the book. One moment, don't quit. Go ahead. - Let's see... It's here, here it is. 'The Court of Cassation considering that the suspect... cannot claim any mitigating circumstances...' Am I talking too fast? Good. 'The court therefore confirms the sentence pronounced.' 'Also quote from page 138 of Thorpe's 'Civil Actions II': 'The possible absence of direct testimony...' 'does not prejudice the validity of other depositions.' Cicero, 3rd Philippic: 'Absit iniuria verbis tamen nec culpa valanda... nec homini publico et publicum.' I skipped a line, sorry. Why did you send me the policeman? Is your conscience bothering you? - If that is your intention. Read on. - You don't think highly of me. 'Sine vestimenta vera, insidia praeest.' That's all. Hello, Peter. - Good night. It's okay, lawyer. So you are an honorable man. Like Biddell, no doubt. Incorruptible. As a judge, he embodied the intransigence of the law. To hear you, he's dead. - I didn't know. I will not impose my presence on you more than necessary. Its duration depends mainly on you, the lawyer. I am looking for a file. - A file ? That's right ? Yes, Quill. But what are we doing here? - The farm. Where is this famous safe? - Patience, Quill. As per usual... Silly. - What file is it? Jail doesn't improve manners. - Did you do any jail time? Mind your own business. Good. What happens to us after your departure? What will you do ? Tricky question. It's all up to you, I think. Were you a tennis champion? - No, I played rugby at Eton. I asked you a question. - And I didn't answer. It's always been a nutty team. What are you going to do with us? It's good that you talk about it. You have to know... One moment, gentlemen. Milk or lemon? A sugar cube or two? Is it a tea party or what? - Mrs. Drop it. We do not know each other. What do you want ? Answer him, finally. He might pee in his panties. That's enough. Take control, lady. What next ? Don't call me ma'am. Dumbass. That's enough. - Nope. You're not in charge. No one has orders to give me. - Shut up, bitch. I admire you, in a way. You are brave. You have no training and I bet... that you have never played rugby. Although, I'm sure, you're a champion in other sports. Shit. My head. What happened ? You dozed off. Completely K.O. Who did that ? - The house master. I... No. I am there for nothing, me. His lesson. Attention. Stop. Stop. - That's enough. Calm down. Take it easy, guys. - Its good. Take the things. - Wait a bit, there's no fire. Minute. I was... He can't have beaten me. Gently. We take that. But first, hide the car. You don't want us to be caught. Go ahead, Quill. This is an important detail. Alright, Well. But we'll meet again. Read on. - You don't think highly of me. 'Sine vestimenta vera, insidia praeest.' That's all. Vestimentis veris. 'Sine vestimenta vera'... Curious. Read on. - You don't think highly of me. 'Sine vestimenta vera, insidia praeest.' That's all. Hello, Peter. - Good night. 'Sine vestimentis veris, insidia praeest.' If the dress is fake... betrayal is near. Come on, try to get up. - I can not. I swear. Sorry, it's my fault we're in deep shit. I am really sorry. - It's okay. But it's too late. We must act. Hurry up. He is upstairs. Looked. Good. Go to sleep. Either way, it's too late. Pick it up. I need him. Shit. Your zozo wants water. Are you going to the kitchen to get him some? You're nice. If you touch the phone, I'll kill you. You won't kill anyone. Brave, girl. I know you. I have already met you. Oh? I doubt. I need to talk to you before they come back. We are different, you and me. We have nothing in common with them. Tell me who you are, we could talk. I set the conditions. - Speak. What if I told you I'm an old friend of your uncle's? I do not believe you. Do as you like. - Come on, let's go in. She wanted to warn the cops. I should have called the whore. Why did you kill him? - Calm down. You shot a cop, you're lost. It was not what we had agreed. Calm. Why do you trust me anymore like before? But you held her back. Why ? - We need each other. We've been together a long time. You don't want her to tell the cops. It's okay, World. I'm looking for something of value. I am really sorry. - Con. 35 pounds. W.C. For women. Hot water. He sees us coming. Which side ? - Wait for me, assholes. Come on, ask. Toilets. It's over there. Silly. You ruined my dress. - I'm terribly sorry. Why the policeman? - Does your conscience itch? 'Sine vestimenta vera'... No, it's 'sine vestimentis'. He made the mistake on purpose, for me to notice? If the habit is false, is that the betrayal is near? What dress? Who ? The cop ? And the clothes? His uniform, no doubt. He talked about this policeman. And his voice sounded funny. Slim. I should have thought of that. Call my home. Can I go to the toilet? - Yes. Quill, go with her. Perfume and whiskey, it turns my stomach. You have a delicate stomach. Why do you have this key? To make sure you can get out of the house. I'll go with you, it's safer. - Between. The lawyer, let's agree. - On what ? Your uncle is a methodical man who lists everything. Its archiving is nickel. - So what ? Where is the 1955 file? I looked for it everywhere. If you tell me where he is, I'll tell you who I am. 1955. World. Arthur Welt. It comes back to me. But... But what do you want? - Justice. No more no less. Your uncle, Judge Biddell, is going to die soon. Biddell here. Why do we take so long? It does not respond ? Impossible. Try again. According to the telecoms, the device is broken or we did not hang up. You don't like the show. Calm down. Drop it. He kills and it is you who are punished. - Shut up. You don't kill cops in England. What will you do now ? Are you silent, yes or shit? It's serious to kill a policeman. How are you gonna kill my uncle? - With extreme joy. But how, Welt? With a bomb, the lawyer. It's childish. You will not escape. I'm sure. He is crazy. We don't kill cops here. You know it well. Listen to me, Quill. - Stop yelling. Did you find any money? No, because there's not a penny here. Listen. Think. If you help me, I promise you that when we're gone... I'll give you money. We look alike, you and me. I've been waiting to be reached at Scotland Yard for 15 minutes. Wait? I only do this. What the hell are they doing? Are they sleeping or what? How ? Perfect. Inspector, you sent me a file urgently. Is the policeman who delivered him there? No, they have all been summoned. Why are you interested? This is the Latin quote that my nephew read to me. He used a phrase that is not in the original. 'Sine vestimentis veris, insidia praeest.' If the habit is false, it means that betrayal is near. The dress could well be a uniform. - Copy the sentence, please. You are there ? - Carry on. I understand the situation, but I'm afraid something has happened to him. Did you call him? - The line is down. Can you... We have a car there. I'll take care of it and call you back. I am at the office. - No problem. 44, meet at 336 Kensington Road... the residence of Judge Horatio Biddell. The phone is down. Check. - Understood. 336 Kensington Road. 'The phone is broken.' They call it telecoms. What do we have to do there? - You're not a judge. A spiel from the lawyer, right? You were going to give me a number. Whatever. You want to purge for something you didn't do? Once out, you get the hell out. - He is crazy. You know it well. You have to hold it. I'll help you. This is my first kill. My uncle's? - No, I'm talking about the cop. It's so simple. We realize it afterwards. In times of war, it is different. We do our duty. You are taught to kill so well that it becomes natural. You follow me ? - Yeah. But I would never dare. I too would have been afraid if I cared about my skin. What if I wasn't motivated by my hatred of the judge. Frankly, I feel sorry for him. Quill ignores everything. Only your famous safe interests him. Can I take off my jacket? He's not afraid of being arrested for that. The uniform, on the other hand... and the police car. We will not escape it. I know it. And I don't care. Can you pour me a whiskey? I congratulate you, doll. You wanted to piss us off and sow discord. You won't get me, my little one. I have to support him, even when things get tough. What do you mean ? You are married ? - Don't get involved, bitch. Don't you think it's time to divorce? It's okay, right, bitch? Welt, she leaves. One move and I'll shoot you. The farm. Come on, walk. Wait here. Mr. Biddell, may I come in? - Yes. What is going on ? No difficulties, I hope? - Nope. Nothing, as you can see. Your uncle tried to reach you, but the phone is down. Oh good ? - Yes. I didn't know. Want to check? Follow me. He is in trouble. It's late. The service will not send anyone. I'll tell them it's okay. They can call the judge. Good evening. - Good evening. Peter, are there any ice cubes? - Yes, in the fridge. Alright, well I'm leaving. - Very well. Ah, you still have a job. Let's see. The receiver is off the hook and a wire is loose. There you go, it's in order. You didn't know he was off the hook? No, I didn't realize that. You know... It is indeed a beautiful house. I'm saving myself now. I'll walk you to the door. I can't find the sparkling water. Thank you for your visit and goodbye. - Goodbye. 'Sine vestimentis veris, insidia praeest.' Curious story. The woman on the couch... was completely frozen. And half naked. As it happens with the judge, we skip over these details. I hung up, and it works. Automotive 44? - It's us. Have you already finished? - If they ask questions, there are glitches. 44. We listen to you. - A fight at Gloucester Road. Meet at 56 Gloucester Road. It is urgent and priority. Let's go. The judge will wait. Bunch of cowards. Talk for you. You caused it, right? Beating up a girl... - Fuck you. You showed initiative this evening, it is the case to say it. Whiskey. Apart from your slight bewilderment, you have been rather brave. We offer to take you home and we start rambling. Nickel, the conversation about the phone. You wanted him to stop me, didn't you? Cool off, you jerk. Drink. Dip your face in ice. We'll see if you like it. That's cool, huh, Mr. Biddell? I kill you, you bastard. - That's enough, Welt. Leave him alone. Thanks, Quill. It's okay. What do you want ? Go back to sleep. 44, have you arrived? Answer. Car 44, answer please. No news from the car police? - No, there was an argument... Reconnect immediately. I want to know. She's stopped somewhere. You won't find it by searching the barracks. I can take a ride, right? - No problem. But... But what ? - My uncle has it in the office. I remember. The verdict was pronounced in November 55. A case that made noise. - It's true ? Yes. The trial was fair, but you maintained your innocence. That's not quite it. I was the only one warned. Did you know why? How could I? I wasn't even... The others have greased their paws. Your uncle, so honest, so honest, tricked me. Why only me? - I would like you to explain it to me. That's what I'm going to do. I was a minus. I didn't have enough cash. I was a boor. I hadn't studied at Oxford. I was not a member of the club. - Hold on... Maybe it was a mistake. - What do you mean, a mistake? The Mistake: My dad drank and went to the wrong club. But no. You're wrong. I know my uncle has integrity. Integrated ? I was alone in the dock. All alone. Where was Philip Henderson, paying me for his scams? What about Ralph Waterson, the knight, when I was in jail? They were acquitted thanks to their bribes. Their pockets were full. Just like that bitch Dame Elvira Perkins and many others. Where were they? At the racetrack? At the Queen's garden party? Or at the Stock Exchange, where they counted their pennies? But I'm not noble. I'm Mr. Welt, period. That's why your uncle screwed me over. Justice be done. Eye for him, tooth for tooth. I give him back what he gave me. World. Come. I've found. Are you kidding me ? There were only 50 books and papers. You knew that, huh? - Papers ? Rotten papers. - Watch the two. Here are the names of the jerks who bribed your uncle. Stop messing around. Are there receipts too? Of course not. He wasn't stupid. They didn't let me tell the truth during the trial. Which truth ? Yours ? Where did the million go, tell me? I had my share. You know the details. He says anything. Have you ever wondered why? out of moral distress. - It was an exemplary judgment. Fifteen years, that I caught. I said exemplary, not necessarily honest. You admit your uncle had his reasons for protecting some of them? OK. Without a doubt. However, you are primarily responsible. You were the perpetrator. The law holds you guilty. - Nope. The Law... - considers you guilty. Guilty. - Nope. Guilty. - I'm not guilty. Guilty. - I'm not guilty. Guilty. Guilty. - Nope. Do you want me to tell you ? You let go of all your aforementioned. They let you down, that's no reason to deny it. You're free to say the system isn't working. I am okay. But the law, your fault or my uncle has nothing to do with it. These are just words that have no meaning. Read, lawyer. Guilty. - Guilty. I am not guilty. I am not guilty. No. You are, before the law. - Nope. Guilty. - No that's not true. Guilty. - You are guilty before the law. But there were others, Your Honor. I gave a list to my lawyer. There were others. You have the list. I was not alone. The case is closed. - Do I have to pay for the others? Case closed. - For everyone ? The case is closed. - Nope. It's not fair. For everyone ? No. I was not alone. The verdict was exemplary. It is inconceivable, shameful. This cop can't disappear like this. And the car? Have you read enough? So, this verdict? 'Guilty', as before? World, I... I'm sorry. I did not know. I couldn't know. - Cowardly. You're as rotten as the others. As much as your uncle who threw me in jail for demanding my share. You won't escape me. I have you all. The whole world will know it. I take care of it. World. - You're all scum. The newspapers will publish these names: Philip Henderson and his decoration. Ralph Waterson and Lady Elvira Perkins. Shut up, Welt. We're in deep shit. Dude, you're just looking for revenge. I want my money, me. You understand ? My money, asshole. Your revenge, I don't care. No, Quill. Fifteen years. Fifteen years, damn it. You're crazy. Berserk. - No, Quill. Don't kill him. He likes you. Kill me, go. You don't scare me. Go on. Drawn. They will get you. You will be punished. Quill is right. You are crazy. You think a piece of paper is enough. Poor jerk. Happy fool. Too bad I won't see your face when they arrest you. Finished, the hero. You'll cry like a kid. You will sweat, you will scream. But no one will hear you. Nobody, Welt. World. Where are you Welt? Where is the light? - Quill. Who's there ? Not a move or I shoot. Who's there ? Hello ? Nothing new ? I am coming back home. - Service is over. Are you being driven? You won't get out of here. Not either, Welt. The bomb explodes as soon as you open the door. Not for long. Hello, Mr Biddell? Why doesn't he react? My God. Don't open the door. I beg you. The door is trapped. Don't open it. Hold on tight. Don't let go of the latch. What are you going to do ? - I'm trying to remove the detonator. Toby. No. Die, bastard. No. Say it... To fart. There's a circuit breaker near the door. To fart.
