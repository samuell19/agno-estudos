Captioning made possible by turner entertainment group This is Philadelphia, 1941. Everybody's got a hometown. This one's mine. My name is Schmid. Al Schmid. Maybe you've heard of me, maybe not. Anyhow, one way or another, what I've got to tell you starts here in Philly. I grew up here. Used to go to places like independence hall. That's where the liberty bell is, and where the declaration of independence was signed. When I went to school, we used to visit the museums and famous places like constitution hall. Our first congress met right here at Tun tavern, where the U.S. Marines were founded back in 1775. And this is where Betsy Ross lived. You heard about her, I guess. She made the first american flag. None of these things meant a whole lot to me then. When you grow up with something, you kind of take it for granted. And the reason you're seeing these places now is just because this is where my story begins. But it could have begun anywhere. It could have begun in your hometown maybe. And what happened to me might have happened to you. Hey, look what I got. Say, what's the idea? What are the flowers for? Somebody kick the bucket? No. First bouquet I ever bought for a gal in my life, and they're for your wife. Say, what are you doing? I got tired of buying batteries. I'm hooking this up to the house circuit. What do you know about electricity? Nothing, but it ought to work. Might set the house afire. Short circuit. Where's Ella Mae? Cooking. On your anniversary? It was her idea. Hi, Al! Hi, Loretta. Those flowers for me? Nope. For your hard-working Mom, honey. Gee Willikers. If anybody ever gave me flowers, I'd fall flat on my face. Mrs. Merchant, when a star boarder buys a bunch of posies for his landlady, you know she's a swell gal. Happy anniversary. Al... the only couple I know that are happy though married. One of these days, you'll be bringing flowers home to a wife of your own. Then there'll be two happy couples. I live alone and like it. You live alone and look it. Wait till you live double. It's more fun. Aw, those flowers are beautiful, Al. Thanks. Now you better get ready for dinner. Come on, Al, let's go get shaved. Ok. I should have thought of that myself. What do you shave for, Al? Oh, to make me handsome. I think you're handsome already. I think you're beautiful. Do you like girls, Al? I sure do. When did you first start liking girls? Well, when I found out they weren't boys. Well, if you like girls, how do you know you're gonna be a bachelor? 'Cause I ain't gonna ever get married. Ever. I wish I could shave, too. Oh, that's easy. Here. Sit right here. Slap on the soap. Feels good. It tickles! Now lift your head. Al, ma says she knows lots of legible girls. Yeah, I know that already. Mom can get almost anybody married, pop says. That's why she invites all those girls here to meet you. Ma says someday you're gonna get hooked. Not me. If I do, I won't be a bachelor anymore, see? I'll tell you a secret if you give me a big kiss. You know, I am gonna get married. Honest? Mm-hmm. When? Oh, 5, 6 years from now. To me? Mm-hmm. Oh, you wouldn't really marry me. Honest to pete, I would. Oh, Gee! I'll always remember the first time I shaved, you did it. I put my car in the garage. Wouldn't you know it? It rained on my anniversary. Never in all my born days did I ever see a prettier table. Candles and everything. Oh, those flowers are beautiful, Al. You do know the way to a woman's heart. You know, the funniest thing happened today. I ran into a girl I used to know. Pretty as a picture. Nice manners, and she's a good bowler, too. Ruth bowled 500. 300 is tops. What's the extra 200 for, good behavior? Maybe. I don't know anything about bowling. Ella Mae, stop being mrs. Cupid, will you? Ditch the bow and arrow. Girls are great for laughs, like those silly hats they wear. Don't bring any new girls around here, please. Well, anyway, she's a wonderful bowler. Hey! You blew a fuse, Jim! I fix something, then everything goes black. Daddy, the lights are out! Yes, dear, I know they're out. You're sure a great electrician. Thanks for the compliment. Jim, the lights went out! Don't you think I know it? Did you ring the bell? Yes, and sparks flew out. We blew a fuse. Don't the merchants live here anymore? Yeah, I'm al Schmid. I board here. I suppose your name is Ruth. How did you know? Ella Mae was te... It's silly for you to be standing out there. Come on in. Confound it! Where's the stairway? Hi, Ruth. Gotta find some fuses. Why don't you take that thing off before it flies away? Hat. Hat. Jim, something's burning on the stove, and I can't see a thing. Find a safe spot and sit. Where's Ella Mae? The kitchen. Have a sofa. I fell over a waste basket, daddy! Then pick yourself up. Ella Mae and I used to work in the same office. Jim and I, we work in the same factory. That must be nice. Yeah. I bumped into the door, daddy! Jim, do you know what you're doing? Of course I know what I'm doing! I'm fixing it! Ouch! Did you get a shock, daddy? Put a penny in the fuse. I just got a shock taking a penny out of the fuse! Don't let anybody ring the doorbell. You see how simple it is? They have a lovely home, haven't they? I suppose you'd like one yourself someday. Well, yes, someday I'd like a home of my own. I thought so. On the installment plan. Most couples start out that way. Hmm. They sure do. The flowers are nice. So many of them, it's almost like a wedding. A wedding? Oh, boy, that's a hot one. You're way ahead on your installments, sister. Hi, Ruth. Well, you two are good friends already. Yep. I feel as if I met her dozens of times. Well, isn't that nice? Come on upstairs, Ruth. Stuck a pin in the doorbell. What gives? Ella Mae has got to stop picking out girls for me to marry. I'm fed up. I just can't take it anymore. She doesn't mean to be a nuisance, Al. It's just kind of a disease with her. I'm gonna cure her. Tonight. Bowls 500. What's the score? You've got 220. Ruth's got 40. Bowls 500, does she? How much longer does that poor girl have to take this? He's making her feel like a monkey. Not that he isn't enjoying himself. Every once in a while those pins act like they're nailed down. He's using her to tell you off. That's what you think. Jim, what are you doing? I'm gonna fix this gadget. It's out of focus. You'll do no such thing. Yeah, but... you'll be sued. Now, put that toolkit away. Put that toolkit away. Yes, dear. You know, I figured out what's wrong. This alley must be warped. So is your sense of humor. Hey, what do you say we drop over to webber's and schlup up a few beers, huh? Aw, but Ruthie hasn't hit her stride yet. Aw, come on, Al. She wants to get her game going, don't you, Ruthie? Yes. I'd enjoy another game. Well, come on, dear. Good night, kids. Have a good time. Good night. Good night, all. Thanks for dinner. You be good. Well, champ, start bowling. You know, I think there's something wrong with the way I play. You don't mean it. I'd be terribly grateful if you'd show me how you do it. Well, I'll tell you, It takes a long time to learn. Not with a wonderful bowler like you to teach me. Well, uh... well, um, you, um, bring the ball all the way back like this... now I see where all your power comes from. And then you let it go like that. Oh, I'm so sorry, but the way you moved your legs was so graceful, I forgot to watch your grip on the ball. Oh. Like this. And that little step you do... is that one of your secrets for success? Oh, well, that was a mistake. You made a mistake? I was a little nervous. You, Al Schmid, nervous? Now, look, are you gonna try what I just showed you? I could never do that cute little step. Now you're angry. I'm not angry! Either put the ball down or throw it. I didn't say on my foot! I missed your foot. By 1/4 of an inch. How would you feel if... from the way you've been acting tonight, I didn't think you knew what feelings were. See here, this wanting to bowl was just a gag? Now, don't spoil things by acting intelligent. Are you trying to make a monkey out of me? It wasn't hard. You're not very bright. Is that right? Now maybe you know how I've been feeling all evening, thanks to you. Thanks to me? Who asked you on this date? Not me. You cooked it up yourself with Ella Mae so you could hook yourself a husband. You wanted me to cooperate. Well, I didn't. I'm no dummy. When I take out a dame... look out! I don't know what you expected from this date, Mr. Schmid, but I certainly didn't expect you. Ella Mae said there'd just be Jim and her. And as far as I'm concerned, I've spent a dreary evening with an awful drip. Good-bye. Hi, Ruth. Ride you home? Go away. But our little boy is sick, Ruth. He keeps crying for you. You can't desert him like this. Stop being a clown and go away. But he didn't sleep all last night. He kept crying, "Mommy, dear! Mommy, dear!" It's all right if you don't love me anymore, but you can't desert an innocent boy. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. It's all nonsense. I don't even know him. Young man, is this just a pickup? Does she look like she don't know me? Or do I have to go as far as to tell you she happens to have a mole on her... excuse me. Take my advice, young woman. You'll go home to your child. Go on, sister. Go home to your kid. Probably crying its head off. It's all right. It's got two of them. Two heads. Imagine that. You know, you acted just like you didn't like my looks. Oh, you're not so bad-looking. You'd say so, even if you didn't think so. You'd think so, even if I didn't say so. Why don't you answer the phone sometime? I do. Depends on who's at the other end. You know, I struck up quite a friendship with your uncle Ralph, except he's a little too old to date. Try harder. He won't hook you. I'm apologizing, see? How about if we throw away the rest of the cards and start with a new deck, huh? How about you keeping your eyes on the road? Would you mind driving a little faster? It's my birthday tomorrow, and I have a dinner date to celebrate it tonight. You got a date to celebrate tonight for tomorrow? It don't make sense. Does it have to? Why are you slowing down? It feels like my left rear needs some air. If you stop, I walk. I guess I was wrong about my left rear. Is that your date waiting for you in front of your house? Yes, it is. Hey, what's the idea? What's the matter? Didn't you see my car? See it? I hit it, didn't i? Who are you? Al Schmid. You want to make something of it? Don't stay out too late, sweetheart. I'll be back at 10:30. What makes men do such crazy things? Women! Uncle Ralph! Is that the doorbell? Uncle Ralph! Uncle Ralph! It's 10:30, sweetheart. Happy birthday tomorrow. Can I interest you in a whirlwind courtship? Say, any loose bowling balls around here? Uh-uh. Don't say it. What girl wants to stay home on the night before her birthday? You don't have to worry about me. I've got plenty of boyfriends. Then I'll start at the bottom of the list and work myself up to number one man. You start going with me, and you're liable to get hooked. Stop throwing that hook at me, will you? After tonight, if you still don't want any part of me, I'll... I'll leave Philadelphia. I'm going to bed. How about celebrating your birthday tomorrow with me and something special, like going to the fights? Save that for your birthday. Ice hockey? Roller skating? Oh, I get it. You either want to exercise or see other people exercise. Oh, don't get me wrong, Ruth. I'll do anything you say. Like going hunting? Believe me, Ruthie, there's nothing like it when the weather is cool and crisp and frost is in the air. You're glad to be alive, and, oh, it feels good to smell those autumn leaves burning. You can hear the coon dogs running. Honest, it's great. Hi, Ruth! Coffee perkin'? It's on the fire. If it gets cold again, why, we'll keep warm. We've got plenty of wood. Boy, when I get out in the country like this, I don't know why I ever came back to the city. Why did you? After my ma died, my old man got married again, see, so I hit the road. Where's the corn? Right there. I was just a kid, but I could take it. How old were you when you started to work? 15. That's kind of young to be on your own, isn't it? How about you? Oh, I like it. I like to live independent. Even if the money ain't much. At the end of that year I saved 8 bucks. Right now I'm sitting pretty. S burner at the foundry. Making 40 bucks a week, trying hard to spend it all. You want to help me spend it? Easy come, easy go, hmm? Easy come nothing. It's hard work. What's the use of making dough if you can't have any fun out of it? You might save some for a rainy day. What rainy day? Ain't gonna be any. I got it all arranged. Every day is gonna be sunday in summer. No responsibilities, no worries, no waiting around on women. Real rugged, aren't you? You know what? No, what? You're the best girl I ever took any place. You know what I like about you? I can't imagine. I like the way you stand up to me. I like the way you curl up in the car seat. I like the way you don't jabber all the time and you sit quiet. I like the way you laugh at my corny jokes. I like the way you listen. I like it when you say you're gonna do something, you do it, and you don't make up a lot of silly excuses. Silly excuses about what? Oh, about going out. I didn't think you would. Look where we are. That's the second time you've kissed me without warning. You want a warning next time? Like what? Oh, something like hello. That's a fair enough warning. Hello. You brown-eyed devil. Jim, what in heaven's name are you doing? I'm fixing the radio. It just so happens that the adjuster case and stud for the oscillator coil are too close to the 5-point female plug for the speaker cable. What does that mean? It means the beginning of the end of our radio. This thing snores. Ah ha ha. Ha ha. Have a rug with the boyfriend. This prince valiant, oh, he's a real rugged fElla. Here, have a comic. Boy, what I'd give for two weeks in Canada now, huntin' bear. Let's go. I'm ready. Oh, no, not with my responsibilities. Dinner's almost ready. Jim, call Loretta. 5 bucks it works. I haven't got 5 bucks. Jim and Ella Mae have picked out their favorite joint for new year's eve. Want to come with me, or should I look up in my address book and find some good-looking dame? Suit yourself. You know, uh, come to think of it, I don't have any other boyfriends anymore. That's not so good. What's wrong with me? So you want a new crop of boyfriends. I didn't say I did. All right, if that's the way you feel about it. Maybe you won't have to put up with me so long. I kind of feel the moss under me. Soon as I get a neat little pile in the bank, I'm gonna pull up stakes, go to canada, spend the whole year huntin' and fishin'. Want to come? When the time comes, ask me and see. I always told you I was a rolling stone. You're not surprised, are you? No. Radio announcer: A report has just come in that the japanese have bombed pearl harbor. We have no further information at present, but more bulletins are coming in over the wires. Where's pearl harbor? I don't know. I was never good at geography. You want to come with me new year's eve? I might, if you ask me nice. Oh. Once upon a time, he told me he was gonna marry me when we were shaving. Fine thing. I think we're both out of luck, Loretta. He'll probably end up happily married to a shotgun and having a romance on the side with his fishing tackle. Well, there's nothing wrong with a shotgun wedding if it's your own shotgun. Jim, where's Pearl Harbor? Pearl Harbor? Oh, it's down the Jersey coast, near Atlantic city someplace. Can't be, the japs are bombing it. I know where Pearl Harbor is. We had it in geography. Aw, it's one of those men from mars programs. The japs just got through telling Roosevelt they love us. We interrupt this program with news of grave importance to every american. Look. War broke with lightning suddenness in the pacific today. Doesn't it smell good? Shh! Without warning, waves of japanese planes attacked Hawaii this morning. Bombers blasted at Pearl Harbor, at the city of Honolulu. The initial attacks caused widespread damage and death. Full reports have not yet come in, but one thing is already certain: The United States is at war with Japan. Stand by. Dinner's ready. War... what do you know? Are you going to war, daddy? Are you gonna be a soldier? Come on and sit down. The roast will get cold. We're at war, honey. The United States is at war. Yes, dear, I know, but the roast will get cold. Now, come on and start carving. Yes, dear. Are you gonna be a soldier, Al? Ah, I'm going to Canada, shoot bear. Leg of lamb, mmm. Boy, oh, boy, that smells wonderful, Ella Mae. It's about time somebody said that. I hope you two are going with us new year's eve. It's that little chop suey place. The management likes to have us come on new year's. Says we add class to the joint. Jim and me got engaged there... oh, I forgot the candles. Oh, here you are. Why, I'm the best little candle lighter in Philadelphia. You know, I bet it would be more fun shootin' japs than bears. Hiya, Joe. Hi, Al. Hiya, scott. Hi. Hey! Where you been? Downtown, joining the marines. Ah, baloney, they'd never take you. Aw, is that so? Take a look at this. United States marine corp. Say, that's pretty good. Happy new year! Happy new year! Happy new year! Haa ha. You know, you gotta be real rugged to get in the marines. First to land first to fight. They turned down 4 guys in front of me. Yeah, the marines aren't takin' everybody. I walked in, they took my pulse, eyes, ears, nose, throat. I coughed. Raised my hand. Slapped me on the back. I'm a U.S. Marine. Well, that was fast. Took 4 hours. How come they held up the war to let you keep our date? Oh, I just described you to them, sweetheart. A picture of the MacArthur when he hears Al Schmid's in the marines. War's over. Ruth, how do you think you're gonna like al in a uniform? Don't expect I'll see enough of him to tell. As soon as I get on the train, Ruthie's gonna get herself a new batch of boyfriends. Aren't you, Ruthie? Yup, one for every night of the week. We kind of made a little agreement for tonight. No getting soft-hearted. Isn't that right? That's right. Boy, oh, boy. 7 more hours before my train leaves. Kind of gettin' excited. Hurray for the U.S. Marines! On your feet, Miss Hartley. Jim? Hmm? Do you suppose he's gonna propose? Search me. I kind of thought maybe he'd do like you did here, when you asked me. Maybe he isn't as smart as I was. You know, Ruthie, I been thinkin'. Yes, Al? The only japs I ever seen were at atlantic city, where you throw the ball and win a kewpie doll, and it gets broke before you get it home. Those japs always were snikey. Yep, shootin' japs oughta be more fun than... shootin' bear? Yeah. You don't figure they could shoot you. Me? Well, what have they got against me? Happy new year, everybody! Happy new year! Ruthie, I... I want a kiss that'll last me for the duration. You got one like that? I'll do my darndest. Hello. And days of auld lang syne for auld lang syne... happy new year, darling. Happy new year. For auld lang syne we'll take a cup... Don't you believe it. The marines'll get every one of those islands back. Providing Al Schmid's one of the marines, huh? Well, I sure hope to be there when it happens. If you two kids want to take an extra minute saying good-bye, Jim'll keep me warm. I won't be long. Gotta pack, still, you know. Call me tomorrow, Ruthie. OK. Happy new year. I don't know whether to ask you to sit down, or what. I, uh, I gotta pack, sweetie. You packed that trunk 10 times already tonight. It's not a trunk. It's just one of those little... I know. Kind of exciting being a marine going off to war, isn't it, Al? Yeah. Well, I guess if I were a man, I'd join the marines, too. I'm glad you're not a man. Why? Why do you think? I'm not thinking very much right now. Honey, I, uh... well, there's a lot of things I'd like to say, but I don't know how to say them, so, uh, I'll just cut it down to good-bye. I'd like to see you off at the train. I don't want you to stay up that late. I'm not tired. No. All right, al, if that's the way you want it. It's better that way. You know, I'm... I'm not much good at letter writing. I'll bet you're not. Anything I want to say, I'd better say now. I know I've been kind of monopolizing your time the last couple of months. I... I want you to get back into circulation. Have fun. You don't have to worry about me. Sure... isn't as if anything was said between us. That's right. Can't tell. Things may be different. Sure. Well, I, uh... hello. You've been fun, sweetheart. You've been fun, too, Al. I want you to get back into circulation, have fun. Ruthie: You don't have to worry about me... you don't have to worry about me... Ruth. You came anyway. Are you sore? Sure, I'm sore. I could murder you. Aw, honey, you were gonna just stand here and let me go without saying anything. I don't know, I might've called to you at the last minute. Sun line limited arriving on track number two. Wilmington... we only got a minute. Ruthie, listen, you love me? Well, me, too, you. I don't want you doing what I said; going out with other guys. I guess I wouldn't have, anyway. You've spoiled me for anyone else. Will you wait for me, Ruthie? You'll have to pry me loose. I'm the sticking kind now. All aboard. I want one last look at that sweet face you got. Don't change the way you look, will you? That's the way I want to see you when I come back. Take care of yourself, and, darling, don't be a hero or anything. Honey, I'm gonna wrap myself up in cellophane. I got a reason now. Aboard! Aboard! I see you got your trunk packed. Yeah. Oh, I forgot about your present, and the train's gonna start. Here, it's for good luck, Al. Oh. Aw, thanks, that's right. I got something here for you. Well, mail it. The train'll go without you. Here, I want you to have it. It's kind of dinky. If you don't like it, throw it away. Good-bye, honey. I even like your hat. Say good-bye to Al? Yes, uncle Ralph. Winter lightning. We don't often see that. Kind of special. Yes. Sort of a special day. The day came when Al sent me a new forwarding address. He didn't know where he was going. Later, a card came saying that private Schmid had arrived safely at his destination. Of course, it didn't say that destination was Guadalcanal. All of us were reading about how important it was that the marines capture henderson field. After we hit the beach, Taking Henderson field was pretty easy. Hangin' on to it was something else. Then the japs pulled back into the jungle. Things got plenty rugged. They taught us what infiltration really meant. They were good at it. Too good. We learned a lot of lessons. Man, we had to. Wasn't enough of anything. Not even any mail. So we read our old letters over and over again. I got one letter off to Ruth. Then things got worse, and there wasn't much time for writin'. Where's that shambo? I don't know. Somebody oughta take care of that. Guess somebody did. I hear they got 4 of our cruisers last night. Now all the nip crews has got to do is sit out there tonight and spit at us. Anybody tell you you're gettin' ripe? That's all right, I'm gettin' used to it. Anyway, jap stinks worse. Gonna dig this hole so deep, it'll be just short of desertion. Got any dope? Scuttlebutt's the nips are landing up the coast a-ways. Jawohl. No sleep, no chow, no smokes, no mail, not enough planes, not enough navy, not enough doctors... brother, we're hangin' on the ropes, and the referee's up to 8. You know something, Al... we've been here two weeks, already. It's our anniversary. Remind me later, I'll bake a cake. Imagine me, gettin' married in the morning and leaving for the embarkation point that very noon. No honeymoon? No nothin'. How do you like this guy? He gets married in the morning and embarks in the afternoon. It's like buyin' oats for a dead horse. Don't let him rib you, lenny. I wish I'd done the same thing. Why you guys gangin' up? Didn't you hear what the lieutenant said? Thought you were takin' your legs back to the medical? I'm ok. It's time to relieve those guys, ain't it? Be dark in a few minutes. Let's make a run for it. Naw, they'd cut you in two. Then the two of us should go. Legs running one way, torso the other. Ha. Diamond comin' in. Rivers coming in. Schmid coming in. Too many in here, get goin'. Is that the straight dope about them comin' over tonight? Shove off, knucklehead. Ok by me. Home and mother. He didn't change the bolt in this. It's still burred. Maybe there's a spare bolt in the parts box. Check your water hose, Al. Water hose, clear. No extra bolt. Dandy. Check the final protective line. Every time we relieve those guys, we have to have a traverse and search exercise. Check the ready boxes, Al. Huh, not on. What's the lay of the base of that stunted tree? That's 400 left... up 10. What do you make that brush across the river? Which one? Right there, right in front of that busted coconut pod. The base point? Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on, the light's failing. Left 920... come on, come on... down 6 mils. Why don't those guys learn how to make up a range card? Hey, lee. Here's a belt with 1 in 3. Stow it. How many boxes you got belt 1 and 5? 22. Here, you guys. Hot potatoes. Ha ha! How do you like that? Scared by a crab. Ha! Sand crab. Doesn't this hole smell bad enough without you cracking a crab in it? What do you expect me to do? Pack it in ice and ship it home? When you two joes quit discussing seafood, there's a small matter of a couple million nips across the river, more or less. Peeyoo. This place stinks. I'm gonna get some air. Better put that back before morning. It'll be back. It'll be back. When they come, I figure they'll cross the river at the sand bar. It's darkest there. Don't fire until then. Move the machine guns up the river, the whole battalion's dug in. Hold your fire till Diamond's outfit opens up. Once the nips spot us, boom, the mortars begin. Jawohl. You're gonna speak your piece tonight, baby. Jawohl... chop their heads off. Al can tell you. He saw me fight in Philly once. Maybe they went home. No, no. This is their chance. They've been getting reinforcements. We haven't. It'll come sooner or later. I'll take sooner. I'll take later. Warm night. Jawohl. I'm thirsty. I'm gonna kiss my shamrock. Just for luck. Maybe a ship'll come in tomorrow with some mail on it. Why is it that everything good is always gonna happen tomorrow? Nah, nothing will happen tonight. I'm gonna flop. Tonight you die. Tonight you die. Can you see them? Can you see any of them? No. But they're there. That's their cheerleader working up their nerve. The shambos are getting crocked again tonight. Their version of Chloe. Sounds like they're all looking for Chloe. Chloe, they're all looking for you. And most of 'em are gonna find you. It's starting. It's starting. We're getting it now. Keep down! No. Don't look till the last second. All they gotta do is wade across to get us. Wish it were quicksand. They won't come from where they're shooting. I think they're crossing! There on the sand bars, Johnny! That's them! Wait. Wait. Fire at the wreckage. Wait. Now! Now! Fire! The tree! The tree! The best tree left! ...traverse! Get up... knock 'em over, boys! One big bowling alley! In the gutter! Kill 'em! Good boy. You stopped 'em. Don't waste your fire there. That's pool sector. Hit 'em in the... hit 'em! Come on. Hurry up. On the double! We're loading as fast as we can. Ok. Ok. There's some that crossed over. Where? On our side! Fire, Johnny, fire! Take over. Take over! I'll feed. I'll feed. Over the sand bank. The sand bank! The sand bank! Come on, you dirty... right now! Attaboy! I got him. I got him! They got bill waters' gun. You'll have to watch that side, too. I'll watch it. I'll watch it. How's Johnny doing? He's dead. Right through the head. Oh, you yellow-bellied, dirty, stinking, slimy pigs! The best guy in the world. Al! Watch it! Don't get trigger-happy. Watch it! Watch it! You hit? No. They got the water jacket. We're gonna get a stoppage. Where's that skivvy who was yelling? Never mind him! Find that stinking crumb for me! Forget him. Keep watching. They'll be coming... Lee! Push me out of your way. Where you hit? Arm. Shoulder. Get me out of your way. Get back, Al. Watch 'em. I'll give you blood poison, you ringtails! Al, don't let 'em... You die! Tonight, you die! Tonight you die. Watch him. Watch him, Al. We come, you die. We come... Eat dirt, tojo! Eat dirt! I'll shut you up. I'll find you. Short bursts, Al. No stoppage. We'll hold 'em, lee. We'll hold 'em. Good ol' gun. Don't jam on me, sweetheart. You suckers. You think I don't see you. That got you rattled, didn't it? Come on. Come on. Just try to get through. Come on, suckers! Thought you wanted to have us in fear. I'm still here. I'm all staked out. Staying here right till the end of the world. Lee, you hurt bad? Stick it out, lee. Get light soon. We're holding. Tonight you die. Tonight you die. Just give me... Why can't I shut you up? Why can't I shut you up? Tonight you die. You ain't coming so fast now. What's the matter? You don't like what you're getting, do you? Come on. There's nobody in your way. Just a couple of marines. Come on. I'll take you. One at a time or in bunches. Lee! Al. Al. My face. I... I can't see. My hands. I can't see! Lee: Don't do it, Al. Don't do it. Don't do it, Al. We'll get help soon. Don't shoot yourself. Shoot myself? Just... just tell me where they are, Lee. Tell me where they're coming from. Show me where they are. I'll shoot 'em. Tell me where they are, Lee. Tell me where they're coming from. Show me where they are. I didn't hear from al for a long time. Philadelphia seemed a long ways from the war, but we thought of al every day. Ruth Hartley, telephone. Hello? Oh, Ruth? Oh, yes, uncle Ralph. There's a letter here from the naval hospital in san diego. I opened it. Yes? Yeah, it says Al is there and ok. Oh, thank God, uncle Ralph. He's safe. He can't write right away, but he wants you to write him. He sends lots of love. He says to address reply in care of Miss Virginia Pfeiffer. Virginia Pfeiffer... american red cross... naval hospital, San Diego. And as far as the red cross workers are concerned, why, they're ok, like the one who brings me a letter. As for me, I'll take a girl named Ruth every time. You know, Miss Pfeiffer, once out there, Ruthie mailed me a curl of her hair, and when I opened the envelope, this curl fell out. The guys ribbed the daylights out of me. From then on, I always used to take her letters away somewhere to read. You never know what was gonna pop out of them. Now, where was I, Miss Pfeiffer? "Well, I'll take a girl named Ruth every time" yeah, well, um, I guess that's all. Oh, come on, Al. Give a little bit. Think how many letters she's written you. Think how she wants to come to you. Well, what do I say? Well, you want to tell her about your gang? Oh, yeah, sure. We got a great gang of gyrenes here, Ruthie. A lot of them from the canal. Lee Diamond, who was with me at kebabian. Um... where's that ashtray, please? On the desk, by your hand. Your right hand, Al. Oh, thanks. Um, "the Guadalcanal gophers knitting society" we call ourselves. More grab... excuse me. Heh heh. More horsin' around than I've seen in a month of sundays. Guess everybody's sure glad they're alive. Well, I guess that's all. Um... isn't there anything else you wanna tell her, Al? Like what? About your eyes. No. Well, she'll have to know sometime. Look, after I've had my operation, after I can see again, then I'll tell her, then it'll be a big laugh for both of us, understand? Al, the doctor doesn't promise you'll see after this operation. Maybe they're... I know those doctors. They never promise anything. I remember the one onboard ship, he kept telling me I'd lose my leg because of that blood poisoning. Didn't, did I? They're both here, and they ain't cork. And add this: Ruthie, I've been saving the best part for the end. You've been asking me why I haven't been able to write to you myself. Well, the reason is... my hands. I... I caught some grenade fragments in them like a dumb boot, but any day now, you'll be getting a letter written by yours truly himself. Al, this isn't any good! You're just storing up trouble for both of you. Don't be a killjoy! Here I am, sitting on top of the world. Now, put this in. Pretty soon, I'll be coming home, walking right up to the steps of your house. And don't you worry about my hands, baby, because when I get them on you, well, you'll know they're all right. Gosh, sweetheart, I can hardly wait to see you. I, uh... oh, say it, Al. Just make-believe I'm a typewriter. Don't be embarrassed. I... I can hardly wait to kiss you for the first time, honey. I never told you what I feel like when you're in my arms, looking up at me with your eyes like... like... with that kind of funny, wonderful light in your eyes, like you did on the railroad station platform. Say it, Al. Lots of love, your brown-eyed devil, Al. She called me that once. It's a kind of joke between us, see? Sure. Ain't that a nice face, though? Ain't it? Take a look. Oh, come on, Schmid. I just looked at it a little bit ago. Now, don't rib me. I only showed it to you once. Yeah, it's a nice face. A guy could lean on a girl like that. A marine don't lean on anyone. If there's any leaning to be done, now the female sex is the weaker, isn't it? Well, everybody leans a little on somebody. Nobody stands alone. You just wait until tomorrow after my operation, I'm all fixed up. I'll stand alone. You just wait. You just watch me! I'll ask permission to be there. Well, you better be. I wanna find out if you're as good-looking as your voice sounds like you are. Oh, don't spoil me, Schmid. Keep it tough. Hi, Al. Is that you, Lee? Yeah, I've been waiting outside. I'm next. You better be careful of this guy. He's a little short on the brain. Yeah? He got 3 machine gun bullets in the shoulder. You'd think after the first one, he'd have sense enough to duck. At least I had sense enough not to play catch with a jap grenade. Why don't you hang a lantern on that thing? Uh, did you buy that present for my wife for me? Yeah, I bought two for you to choose from. Hiya, Tom, how's your malaria? Wonderful. It's that tall. You'd never know it. Ha ha. Wither wouldst thou love to be shoved, alberto? Oh, once around the hall, Thomas. Ok. Here we go gathering nuts in may nuts in may, hay in may here we go gathering... Darken the room, please. Hold the bandage, will you, Schmid? Guess we're ready, now. Not too soon for me, sir! I'm bustin' at the seams! It's been the longest 3 weeks of my whole life! Now, look, Schmid. Don't you expect to see the minute the bandage is off. I'm darkening your room... ok. Ok, you told me that. Just get it off, will you? Now, I'm not making any promises either. You see, the healing process... all right, all right. Let's try it, please, sir! The bandage is off now. You can open up. No! Not a darn thing! You told me it was dark in here. How about that flashlight, sir? You promised! I will. Take it easy. I'm taking it easy, sir. Well, you don't expect me to see with the blinds down. You think I don't know my eyes have been injured? Why, I even expect to be wearing glasses the rest of my life. "Four-eyes Schmid. " I don't mind, sir. I don't mind the glasses. Really, I don't. I'm going to snap the flashlight on behind my back and then bring it around towards your face. First time you see it, holler. I'll holler. I'll holler so loud my girl will hear me in Philadelphia. Ready? Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready! Turn it on, sir. Even if it's only a two-bit flashlight. I wanna see stars and angels and Ruth. Give me something to holler about, please! Come on, this is one time I wanna get hit right smack between the eyes, come on, doctor. Let's see the light. Bring it closer. See anything? Yeah, like a locomotive headlight. Way off in the fog. Bring it closer! Closer! Closer, please! I'm sorry, Schmid. The light was put on your eyes. Close. No. I can't be blind... not my whole life! Look, Schmid... please... please... you medicine fellows, you know. You're educated, you're smart. You got ways of fixing guys up. I tried my best. I fought. I'm not asking for so much! Schmid, this examination isn't final. I told you yesterday it wouldn't be. When can we try again, sir? Tomorrow? Next week? You're still suffering the effects of eye concussion, Schmid. There's still pieces of grenade that have to work themselves out. You'll probably need another operation after a while. When? We'll have to wait 6 months, a year. Even then, there's no assurance you'll ever see. 6 months? What are my chances, sir? Give it to me straight. Miss shelby, bring me a card, please. I have a card here I want you to take with you, Schmid. We have people right here now who will teach you. This is for blind people! I don't want any of this stuff! I want to stand on my own! I don't want any of this stuff! Schmid... right now, I'm thinking of someone, a doctor friend of mine. We went to school together. He was blind from the time he was 10 years old, but that didn't stop him. He's married and has two kids. He's a fine psychiatrist and a happy man. Are you listening to me, Schmid? I'm not saying it'll be easy for you, and these first few months are the toughest. People get the wrong idea about blindness. A blind man isn't helpless; he just has to do some things differently from the rest of us. Are you listening to me, Schmid? Why don't God strike me dead? We back at the warden? A couple more steps. I'll take it from here. All right. Hi, Al! Hiya, gophers! I'm shoving off. Good luck. Now, listen, tommy, let me get the picture straight. You mean to tell me that she tricked you into going up to her apartment? Sure, I was trapped! She had a beautiful two-room joint overlooking los angeles. So I go up there with her, and she pours me a nice, tall drink. Then we sit down on the sofa. What happened then? Take it easy, I'll tell you. Well, we're sitting on the sofa, see, and I got my arm around her. Everything's getting cozy, see? Just as I'm about to kiss her, all the lights go out. Killed all the conversation. Well, what'd you do? I was in luck. I had my flashlight with me. Did you light it? No, she wouldn't let me! She told me the noise would wake up her father. Tommy: Hey, sarge, where you going? I got my first 3-day liberty, tommy. I'm going to los angeles. You got a date? No. You call this number when you get there. I don't like blind dates. She'll be sober when you get there. Give her a ring. What's she like? Out of the world. Out of this world, huh? Well, los angeles city limits, how much farther out can you get? What's she look like, an umbrElla? Are you kidding? She's a beauty! Big brown eyes like saucers. And when she smiles, she flashes the most beautiful set of teeth you ever saw. And what a build! This girl has got a figure out of the world! When you see this girl's figure... now, I've seen a lot of figures, brother, and I know what I'm talking about. She's got the most... wait a minute. I'll get my hat. I'll go with you. Where's my hat? Al, this is lee. I just heard the bad news about... about the eye test. Look, al, I got an uncle who's a doctor... and he's no dope. 4 years city college, harvard med school grad, a real smart guy. And sometimes he's right, and sometimes he's wrong. Like the time, al, that my aunt, his very own wife, went to him, and he says, "Minnie, you're gonna have a baby. " I mean, this is his very own wife! And she's overjoyed. And he's happy. And they call us on the telephone, and they tell us how they always wanted to have a baby. And we tell them we think it's wonderful. You shoulda been there, al! They were going to name the baby leroy, after me. You know what, Al? The next morning, the very next morning, we find out it was something she ate. So you see, al, what do you got to worry about? Doctors are human, they make mistakes! Thanks for coming, lee. I'll see you in the morning. Ok, Al. Ruth! Ruth! No, stop it! No, stop it! No, stop it! No, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Where is he? Where are they? Find them for me. Please find them. Please... find them. Please find them for me. Please... find them for me, lee. F-f-find them for me. Find them... where are... Why can't I shut you up!? No! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth. Ruth. Ruth... where's that bench you were talking about? Right here. I want to get this over with quick. Got your pencil? Yes. Dear Ruth... what harm would it do to wait another week? What good will it do? I made up my mind last night. Your mind's made up, but what about giving Ruth a chance to decide for herself? To decide what? How to ruin her life? Look, she's worked hard. Me, the bigshot. I was gonna buy her things she never had, I was gonna see that she'd never have to work again. What good can I do her now? I can't get married. I'll never be able to earn enough money to keep her. But, Al... I won't have her being a seeing-eye dog for me! How do you know she'll feel that way about it? At least tell her the tRuth! Find out what she wants! Sure. Tell her the tRuth so she'll pity me. Nothing doing. I'm leaving pity out of this. Aren't you leaving love out of it, too? You don't seem to care what you do to her. She isn't going to stop loving you, writing to you! Send the letters back, then! Supposing she does have a few bad days. She's pretty. She'll meet another guy. She'll fall in love. You gonna write the letter for me or do I have to ask lee Diamond to do it? All right... ok. Dear Ruth... I know this is gonna be a kind of surprise to hear, but I'm going to give it to you straight. I'm not coming back to Philly. Not now, not ever. And as far as getting married is concerned, well, it just ain't up my alley, that's all. I hope you'll be very happy, and I hope you'll find a new boyfriend real soon. Yours, al Schmid. Oh, Al. Schmiddy, don't you get tired eating in the supply room? Why don't you eat in the mess hall with the rest of the guys? Why don't you learn how to feed yourself? It's easy, honest. Coming up. We put the food on the plate according to the clock. Like, potatoes at 12 o'clock, vegetables at 3:00, meat at 6 o'clock. Coming up. It's part of our job to teach blind guys how to... don't call me blind! I don't see so good yet, that's all. Don't you ever call me blind again! Ok, kid, ok! Anyway, why don't... mind your business. Coming up. I don't want any more. You want dessert? No. Al, here you are! Al, there's a long-distance telephone call for you. I'll take you. From where? It's from Ruth, from Philadelphia. I ain't here. Well, she's probably received your letter... Don't you understand? I can't talk to her. Tell her to leave me alone! All right, Al. Can I steer you anyplace, Schmiddy? No. Wanna hit the sack? I can sleep anytime. See with me, it's always night time. How about the recreation room? We can get Jack Benny on the radio. Ok. Ready? You know, that was an old girlfriend of mine calling. Her name was Ruth. Yes, operator. One Moment, please. A friend of the party's wants to know if she can accept the call. A Miss Virginia Pfeiffer from the red cross. Oh, yes, yes. She's been writing. Go ahead, san diego. Hello? Hello? Is this Ruth? Yes, Miss Pfeiffer. I got al's last letter! Understand this, Ruth... he isn't breaking with you because he doesn't love you. Believe me, he does. Well, then, why? He just had a very bad shock. What is it? Al has completely lost the sight of one eye and may never regain sight in the other. That's why he's not calling. He's afraid of becoming a burden. Do you understand now? Hello, Ruth? Yes. Yes, I understand. There's one thing I'd better find out. Uh, now, you can think this over if you want to. It'll make a difference in helping Al. You still love him? Do you want him? I mean, as a husband. Oh, yes! Yes, I do! Remember, he may be totally blind for the rest of his life. What does that matter? Do you want to think it over? Think what over? I didn't fall in love with his eyes nor the color of his hair. I fell in love with him, with Al! That hasn't changed just because something's happened to his eyes. You're the kind of girl I thought you were. Now, listen carefully, Ruth. I know you'll want to come out here, but don't come. Al seems to go off the deep end every time I mention your name. Just keep writing to him and try not to mind if he doesn't answer. Just be patientand keep loving him. We have a pretty big job ahead, but we can do it. My part first, and then yours. Understand? I do understand. And I'm so grateful to you for everything. Remember that he loves you and that he needs you terribly. So if you'll keep loving him... oh, I will. Always. Good-bye, then. I guess Al still doesn't know what a wonderful girl he has. Bye. Lee: Hey, angelo, how do you like that? Hey, guys. Take a look. No more cast, isn't it wonderful, huh? How do you like it? Isn't that marvelous? Marvelous. I want you to meet my friend. Glad to see ya. Hey, guys! The cast... it's off, look. Let's barbecue it. Ha ha. Would you care to say a few words to the radio audience? Sure. Hello, Mom? It was a great fight. Didn't lay a glove on me. Ha ha. You know what I'm gonna do with this? Don't say it. Gonna have it mounted. To decorate the homestead in flatbush, directly over the stove. How's the arm work? Come again? How does the arm work? Great. Here, give me one of them darts, I'll show you. Tom, hold this. Observe. Spitball Diamond is now on the mound. Let me out of here. What are you, a coward? Right down the alley. Two fingers. Hmm... almost a bull's-eye. A bull's what? Well, the wind was against me. Would you like to dance with a girlie with a hole in her head? Hi, al! Hi, gofers. Hi, Al. Tommy. Hi, hero. Guy made that crack gets his neck broken. Ok, killer. Killer I don't mind. It ain't pretty, but neither am I. Whose turn is it next? I'll take it, red. In the evening, by the moonlight you can hear those darkies singing in the evening, by the moonlight... any of you birds hear talk about goin' home for Christmas? Yeah. Wish I could believe it. Wonder what kind of a Christmas they have in california? I hear they got no snow, but they got variety. One year, fog; the next year, rain. I heard everybody who's fit goes home, walking cases get a furlough. That's the scuttlebutt. Speak up, red. Or write it down. If I did write it down, you couldn't read it. You blind bat. Ha ha. I've heard of bedroom eyes. Red here's got a bedroom voice. Well, I guess I'll be stuck here. Me, too. You're a walking case, Al. Yeah, except I got no place to go, see? Well, I know I'm going home. The doc says for good. I telephoned my wife last night to give her the glad news. When I told her I was comin' home, she got all choked up, couldn't talk. Just busted out cryin'. Don't you hate it when a dame cries? No, with me it's different. I'll tell you why. When a guy gets married, like me and my girl did, and goes overseas, a lot of things can happen by the time you get back. The way she cried told me a lot of things. Told me how much she wanted me back. Sometimes, when a dame cries, it makes you feel good. You read in the paper about a guy's wife runnin' out on him, and right away, you think it's gonna happen to you. Lee: I figure it this way. Any guy's wife that would double-cross him while he's in the service will do it in peacetime, sooner or later. What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get home, bill? I think I'll spend about 3 solid weeks just saying hello to my wife. What are you gonna do after you get tired saying hello? I got myself a nice little street corner all picked out for my business. You lucky stiff. Hi, Virginia. Hi, lee. Join the gofer sewing circle. We're cookin' up a storm. Sure it's not private gab? We got no secrets from you. Irish has been telling us about a business he's going into, after he gets his discharge. Yeah, on a corner. Oh, if it's on a corner, It must be a saloon or a bank. Which is it, Irish? You're not even close. Twice in his life my old man got his name in the papers. The first time, in 1917. He was the first to enlist in milwaukee. The second time, in 1930. He was the first vet to sell unemployed apples. Any of you guys want a piece of my street corner? I ain't bright, but I'm honest. Count me in. "Irish and Schmid, apples and pencils. " We oughta do all right. Aw, come on. Climb out of your foxholes. What's the matter, you guys think nobody's learned anything since 1930? Think everybody's had their eyes shut and their brains in cold storage? I'll tell you guys something funny. I'm scared. I wasn't half as scared on the 'canal. If a man came along... anybody... and told me I'd have a decent job the rest of my life, I'd get down on my knees and wash his feet. Well, I'm not scared. You talk like a guy with dough in the bank. You ask me what I want out of life. Well, I'm not an ambitious guy... 30 bucks a week. Enough to take my girl out on a saturday night, a ball game on sunday... That's about all I ask. Or is that too much? You're a cinch. Things are different now. The whole country has its eyes open. Won't be like 1930 again. That's pretty music, but I don't understand the words. What about the G.I. Bill of rights? I'm going to college on that. They guarantee your old job back, Bill. They guarantee your job, do they? I wrote my old boss to get my job back. What did he write me? Quote, I'll tell you what he wrote. "I'm in a new business, and your old job just ain't. " There's nothing in the G.I. Bill of rights to cover that. You can't get your job back if it doesn't exist. That's gotta be considered. Considered? Now I'll come out and say what I'm thinking. How about them considering the silver plate in my head? How long did we get to consider when they said, "hit the beach," at Guadalcanal? They said, "go," and we went. Well, that's ok. Well, I want some considerin' now. I got a wife. I want to support her. The doc says I can never do heavy work again, ever. Well, I wanna work. My boss says, "no job, nothing to come back to. " How do I know anybody'll ever want me? Yeah. Yeah, when I get back to el centro, I'll probably find some mexican's got my job. Quiet. I'm sorry, Juan, you're a mexican, but you're different, y-you're one of the guys in "b" company. Nah. I'm not different, joe. I'm just a mexican, like a lot of other mexicans who fought. You dumb coot. He's got more foxhole time than you've got in the marine corps. Can I put in my two cents? You guys are all jumpy. Nobody can blame you. You're shut off here, and sometimes it must seem as if nobody cares. Who does? Well, people care, all the people. Civilians aren't strange animals. They're your own fathers and mothers and wives, your sweethearts, your friends, and believe me, if they can help it, you're not going to be let down. Aw, that's a dame's... I mean, a female's point of view. So the G.I. Bill sends some guys back to school. Gets some other guys jobs. Gets a guy started on a farm. So maybe we'll even have prosperity for two years after the war while we catch up on things... like making diaper pins and autos, things the poor civilians did without. But what happens after two years? Answer me that. A bonus march. No, sir. You guys think because you did the front-line fighting you can take a free ride on the country for the rest of your lives... No, sir. Look, there's no free candy for anybody in this world. I know what I fought for... I fought for me. For the right to live in U.S.A. And when I get back into civilian life, if I don't like the way things are going, ok, it's my country. I'll stand on my own two legs, and I'll holler. And if there's enough of us hollering, we'll go places, check? Check. Listen to these two characters checking each other off like a couple of bookkeepers. So what? We agree. Only you ain't got the books to check, that's what. You ain't gonna write the piece. You ain't gonna run the country. You're just a couple of ex-heroes sittin' around in a hospital. I'm going to be a lawyer. Who says, in 10 years from now, I won't be a congressman? I'm going into politics with both feet. And if I have anything to say about it, my kid isn't gonna land on any beachhead. And if any old windbag tries to sell me the idea of shipping oil to japan or doing business with any new Hitler, he'd better start ducking. Ok, Junior. I'll check that. And I'll put a little handwritin' on the wall for you, too. We don't want no apples. And whoever's running the country better read it too... no apples, no bonus marches. I'll paste that in your hat, congressman. Ok. Like they say in those old revival meetings, "hallelujah and amen. " Ok, Al, ok. And I'll wrap it up for you. One happy afternoon, when God was feeling good, he sat down, and he thought of a rich, beautiful country. And he named it the U.S.A All of it, Al... the hills, the rivers, the lands, the whole works. Don't tell me we can't make it work in peace like we do in war. Don't tell me we can't pull together. Don't you see it, guys? Can't you see it? You askin' me? Yeah. I'm askin' you like everybody else. I don't see none of those things you said God made. I don't see a thing. I didn't mean it that way. No, you didn't. But a lot of things take time in this life. When a man has to climb a mountain all alone, sometimes he loses the way... and it's up to his friends to help. What's on your mind? You. I thought it was something important. You're important. Sit here. I want to say something important, too... straight and tough. Shoot. Suppose the worst happens to you, al, and you don't get your sight back. I'm not kidding you, you're gonna be cut off from certain things. No hunting, no driving your own car, no watching ice hockey. But even without sight, a man can swim and dance and go fishing. He can't hunt, but he can walk in the woods when the leaves are falling. With only a little training, he can learn to play poker, checkers, chess, dominoes. He can learn to read by the touch system, type his own letters, listen to music... he can play any old instrument he wants. Don't you see, Al... once you get over your fear of being helpless, the whole world is wide open for you. With a tin cup? If you're afraid you can't hold down a job anymore, that's just crazy, Al. You can go back to a job that's just as good as the one you left. Yeah? Why, right here in California, there are over 400 blind workers in the aircraft factories. I tell you, it's all very interesting, Virginia, but it sort of doesn't apply to me. A couple of months from now, I'll be able to see all right. Sure, Al. I hope so, too. I just thought you might like to know some of these things. Yeah. Sure. Ok, Al. Yeah. Hey, tommy, tell 'em about the first time you went huntin'. Oh, the time I want to take my girl huntin'... so I go out, and I buy the whole thing... the hat, you know, with the tail in the back, and the leather coat with the things across here, with the shells... you know, and the gun. Now I gotta get a dog, see? I buy the best dog in Illinois, the best huntin' dog you could buy. 75 bucks. One dog. $75. So I went huntin' with her, see? We get out there. Soon as he sees a rabbit or a bird, stops dead, he goes like this. Doesn't catch nothing. Just like this... see? I beat him over the head with the gun a coupla times. I broke him of that habit. Ha ha ha. Ha ha. Hi, Virginia. Hello, boys. Al, it's time for you to see the captain. I want you to see a picture of my girl. Beautiful? She sure is. But who's the guy with his arm around her? That's my friend from the draft board. Beautiful girl. Great friend. Captain Burroughs says to come in. Thank you. Door, Schmid... to your right. Good morning, Miss Pfeiffer. Good morning, captain Burroughs. Good morning, Schmid. Good morning, sir. Hi, Al. Sounds like lee. That's it. Schmid, I got great news for you. You're getting a navy cross. Congratulations. That's wonderful, Al. Navy cross... never in all my born days did I think... the navy cross? Stand at ease. Corporal Diamond's getting one, too, although the ceremonies won't be held at the same place. That sounds great, lee. Yeah, gave me a wallop. Your hometown's quite proud of you, Schmid. I guess you know that the papers have been printing a lot of stories about you. So the navy's decided that you'll get your award at the Philadelphia navy yard. Corporal Diamond's going on furlough, too. He'll be on the train with you and effect your transfer to the naval hospital. You leave tomorrow. You'll be home in time for Christmas. Couldn't ask for a better Christmas present than that, could you? I gotta go back there? It's your hometown. Why not? Well, it's notmy home anymore. We've found, from past experience that men convalesce quicker in a hospital near their home. But it isn't my home, sir. According to your record, it was when you entered service. Yes, sir. But, uh, I-I'm gonna move. I got a brother in Chicago, and when I don't have to go to no hospital no more... let's stop shadowboxing. You don't want to return to Philadelphia because you've got friends there. You're afraid to have them pity you. That's it, isn't it? No. N-no, sir. That isn't it... just because a guy happens to have a little eye trouble. Why, in a couple more months, after I've had another operation, I'll be able to see all right, sir. Well, then, why don't you go home? You've got a girl there. No, sir. She and I are all washed up. I got nobody in Philly for me. Nobody. You need to find out from the people who knew you before you were injured that you mean just as much to them now. Until you learn that, you won't make any progress. I'm making progress, sir. I'm trading a couple of eyes in for a ribbon on my chest. Now I'm going home so people can stare at me. That's fine progress! You're under orders, Schmid. You're going back. Good-bye. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Good-bye, Diamond. I'll be seeing you. So long. So long, Schmiddy. Here we are, Schmiddy. You gonna miss me, Ginnie? I don't know how we'll run the place without you. By the way, I put a couple of letters in your bag you don't know about. Thought maybe you might want Lee to read 'em to you. Aw, you're a great fixer, aren't you? I don't wanna read 'em. I'm sorry, I just wanted to help... listen, I-I've been carrying a beef inside me, but it hasn't been against you. You're great. I'm glad you think so, Al. Listen, will you do me a favor and send Ruthie a wire and ask her to... ask her to meet me at the station, will you? Sure, I will. It's not for the reason you think. I just want to get things straightened out once and for all. As long as I can't see, I don't want to marry anyone. Ok, Al? Keep your powder dry, Virginia, and thanks for everything. Good-bye, Lee. Good luck. You know... some of these days, I'm gonna come back here and find out what you really look like. I'll be an awful disappointment. No, you won't. You're swell. Don't stop fighting now... don't. So long, Ginnie. Bye. So long, Schmiddy, you lucky stiff. Say hello to Philadelphia. So long, fellow. Have a swell trip. Dear heavenly father, he's got to come home where he belongs. He's got to know he's wanted. Lee: It was gonna be the biggest production we ever had, and... don't you gentlemen want to get some sleep? How about it, Al? I'm not sleepy. Well, call me when you want me. Thanks anyway. So, like I was saying... everything was going along all right until our high school teacher hands me the girdle, and she says, "put this on. " I took one look at that belly choker and I hit the roof. I says, "look, Miss Tuttle, "I am willin' to be the dame in this play, "I am willing to wear the blonde wig. "I'm willing to wear the dress with the phony fronts. But a girdle stops me cold. " Nobody was gonna get me to crawl into that booby trap. So she gives me a pep talk about how if I don't wear the girdle, I'll have nothing to hold up my stockings. You know how them girdles are. They got long tentacles hanging down all around them. And by this time I'm burnin', I'm really steamed up. And I say, "look, Miss Tuttle, I won't do it. " She says, "you will. " And I says, "I won't!" So I put on the girdle. Well, it was about this big... junior miss size. I wrestled with that thing for a solid hour. I was on a chair. I was on a table. I was on a floor. You've gotta get leverage. I pulled it, I yanked it, I jerked it, then, by some supernatural miracle, I got it on. It was like sitting in a tight foxhole. Why do women insist on wearin' them things? Believe me, Al, if I was a dame, I'd settle for the spread. You don't have to entertain me, Lee. Where are we? Still crossing Ohio, I guess. What time is it? Uh, 5 to 3:00. Wanna go to bed? I'll call a porter. Aw, I feel kinda jumpy. You don't have to sit up with me, Lee. Oh, I'm not sleepy. How about some dominoes? I'm the sticking kind, Al. Don't change that sweet face of yours, Suppose the japs shoot you? Me? What have they got against me? I'm the best little ducker in the world. I'm the sticking kind, Al. I wanna see that sweet face when I come back. Why'd you join up, Al? I wanna see... why'd you join? I wanna see! I wanna see! What's the sense of seeing Ruth just to break up with her? It was a crazy idea I had. Won't do her any good, won't do me any good. We're finished. There's no point in having a wake over the corpse. I don't want her to come to the station. I don't want to see her at all. You send a telegram for me. Tell her not to come. That's not fair, Schmiddy. She's probably planned a Christmas celebration. You're going to see her. Lee, don't make me fight you. You and me, we don't have to be polite with each other. What have I got to celebrate? What does "welcome home" mean to a blind man? Maybe more than to anyone else if he doesn't hide it from himself. Cut the guff. You're not talking me into anything. Al, I want to tell you something. You gonna write that wire? I'll write the wire, but first I want to get something off my chest, from me to you without etiquette, too. Al, back there on the 'canal, I thought something about you I never told you before. It was after you got the grenade in your face. Towards morning, it was, when we thought the japs were coming in on us. You remember what you did? You pulled your. 45, and I thought you meant to kill yourself. But you kept yelling out, "tell me when they come in, lee, I can't see 'em, but tell me where they are, and I'll shoot 'em. " Well, I was scared to death and layin' on the ground waitin' for a jap bayonet. But I kept thinking something. I thought, "that boy Schmiddy has more guts than any man alive. " I was wrong, Al. I think you were hopped up by excitement, like you'd taken a shot or something. I don't think you got any guts, Al. I think you're kind of yellow. You haven't got guts to see Ruth. Shut up, shut up! You haven't got guts to pay off on a bet! You didn't enlist in the marine corps because you had any sense in your head. You didn't care about this was the U.S.A. And you lived in it. You didn't know what the war was about, and you didn't care. You're a hopped-up kid lookin' for excitement... that's a lie, and you're a stinkin' liar. You're saying those things 'cause you know I can't crack you in your lyin' face. Ok... then ask yourself a question. Would you do it over again? If you knew you was gonna be blind, would you do it over again? Or would you ask for shore duty, maybe? Al, look. In a war, somebody gets it, and you're it. Don't you think I'd crawl on my hands and knees to a doctor if he could take an eye out of my head and put it into yours? But he can't, al, he can't. Believe me, you ain't been a sucker. There ain't a guy who's been killed or disabled in this war who's been a sucker. I know it's a stinkin' war, but it has to be won. And you're one of the guys who lost some chips in the winning. Everybody's got problems. I know you're in a tough spot, but it ain't peaches and cream for everybody else. What problems have you got? You're in one piece, ain't you? Your wife don't have to turn over in her insides when she sees you. When you go for a job, there ain't nobody gonna say, "we got no use for ex-heroes like you. " That's what you think. Sure, there'll be guys who won't hire you, even when they know you can handle a job. But there's guys that won't hire me because my name is Diamond instead of Jones, 'cause I celebrate passover instead of easter. Do you see what I mean? You and me, we need the same kind of a world. We need a country to live in where nobody gets booted around for any reason. Aw, I'm all mixed up... mixed up and scared. Draggin' at the heels and yellow. Oh, no, no, I... I wasn't telling the truth before. You're not yellow. Aw, you're a swell guy. You're a pure sort of a guy if I ever saw one, but... don't leave all your guts back on the 'canal. You need 'em now, too. That girl loves you, Al. You two can make out. She's the real goods. Ok, Lee. But now we send that wire. Didn't what I said mean anything to you? Yeah. It means send that wire. It's good we're late. Ruth got that wire, then. Yeah. It's too bad we can't get those navy crosses together. We won 'em together; we oughta collect 'em together. Say, Al... you hold any hard feelings about what I said last night? Nah, forget it. Say, you don't have to come to the hospital with me. Your wife's sittin' in new york, bitin' her fingernails. We're late enough already. It's all right. The trains run pretty often. Well, maybe there's a navy car waitin' for me. Or you can just stick me in a cab. Well, I'd like to get you settled. Come in. Your bags are in the vestibule, gentlemen. Mr. Schmid, I heard that march of time broadcast about what you done on Guadalcanal, and I saw your picture in life magazine. And I want to say I feel honored you rode in my car. Thanks. And I read you were there with him, sir. Thanks for letting us stay up so late last night. No. Like I said, it's been an honor. I want to navigate this on my own. Your bags are right there, gentlemen. Boy. It sure smells like Philly, all right. You know, not so long ago, I left from the same place. Ain't it grand to be home? Say, you don't see Ruth around here, do you? No. That's fine. Now that's off my mind. Uh, do you wanna wait here a second? There's a conductor over there I want to ask about trains. I wanna gauge my time. Sure, go ahead. Stick here with the bags a minute, will you? I'll be all right. All aboard! I recognize you from Al's snapshot. You're Ruth. Yes. I'm Lee Diamond. Didn't you get the telegram? Yes, but I decided to come anyway. Lee, you've got to help me. I have to get him back among his friends, where he lived. He's got to know that we... he's pretty set on not going. Where are you taking him now? Navy hospital. Well, he's got to come home first, even if it's just for an hour. It'd mean so much right now. If he won't go with you, he won't. You'll just have to try. I've got Al's car with me. Couldn't you lie to him and tell him it's a navy car, maybe? I don't know. It... I want one chance, lee, won't you give it to me? It's his whole life I'm fighting for. Yeah. I know. And yours. Al, here's luck. Number one, there's a navy car waitin' for you; number two, I can get a train to new york in 15 minutes. Do you mind if I take you up on that proposition? Sure, lee. Go right ahead. Thanks. Your bag's on your right. Here's the navy car. There's a good-looking wave ready to take you. A wave? Say, that's class. Don't step out of line. She's a loo-ie. Ha ha. I guess I won't see you for a long time, huh, Lee? Well, maybe after my furlough, I can drop off and see you on my way back to San Diego. Hey, that would be great, if you could. You'll probably see a lot more action before this is over. Looks that way, my arm's coming along good now. It'll be funny, sittin' around, thinking of you landing on a beachhead again. When I hit the beach, I'll mark the first nip for you, Al. Yeah. Get 'em in the eyes. Right in the eyes! Gosh... that kind of popped out of me without me even thinking of it. Ha ha. Take care of yourself, Al. Likewise. I'm gonna miss you, you old ball of fire. Yeah. Likewise. Say, uh, what were them old hebrew words you told me? Sholem alechem? Yeah. Well, uh... Sholem alechem, kid. That goes double for you, Al. Well, I'm off to the beachhead. Ok, lieutenant. I'll write you, Al. Thanks. So long, Lee. So long, Al. I know where we are now... passin' independence hall. I used to remember hearing the bell strike the hour. Somehow, whenever it struck 12 noon, I got hungry. Out on Guadalcanal, I remembered that bell whenever I was hungry. Good day for huntin'. Cold and crisp. Had my huntin' coat and boots on... be all right. Ever go huntin'? Mm-hmm. Couldn't hit the broadside of a barn right now. Got eye trouble. That's why I'm here... get 'em fixed up. Are we at the hospital? Mm-hmm. Steps. I used to count steps when I was a kid. Now I'm back at it again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Any more? Uh-huh. 7, 8, 9... Ruth... you're home now. Please forgive me for doing it. I had to. Why? It's no good. Now, be reasonable, al, it's Christmas eve. I didn't have the heart to tell Ella Mae about your wire. She has dinner all ready for you, in your honor, and... Loretta has a present for you. It won't work. I'm not going in. You can tell 'em anything you want. You're still the same stubborn... look, if you and I are finished, ok. But why can't you stay to a Christmas party with your friends? Al. Oh, Al. Hiya, kid. I read all about you in the newspapers. You killed 200 japs, didn't you, Al? So they tell me. Come on inside. I'll take your bag. I'll show you the way. You got hurt in the eyes, didn't you? Yes, I did. Sometimes I need some help. Ma? Al's home. What's it like when you can't see good? Is it like being in a dark room? You got it. Al! Oh, it's so good to see you. I don't see why I can't be sentimental, too, especially under mistletoe. Hi, Ella Mae. How's Jim? Oh, he's fine. He'll be home from work any minute now. Give me your coat. Now, you just make yourself right at home again. Loretta, you come on in the kitchen and help me get the drinks ready. Al and Ruth, you go on in there and sit down. Sofa still in the same place? Yes, everything's just the same. Smoke? No, thanks. I don't smoke, al, remember? Yeah. I remember. Do you have a match? Got one. Things pretty much the same, huh? Yes. Everybody's working a little harder, of course. Things are rationed, too. Yeah. I heard all about it. As long as I'm staying for dinner, you might as well know how they feed chow at the hospital. I mean, with people with eye trouble. They use the clock method. Potatoes at 12:00 on the plate, vegetables at 3:00. Meat at 6:00. You see? Virginia wrote me, Al. Oh. Great little fixer, that girl. She's wonderful. Yes. She's ok. You're looking fine, Al. How about you? You change your hairdo or anything? No, I... I look the same, I guess. You still wear those silly-lookin' hats? I guess you'd think so. We're awfully proud of you, Al. Aw. Cocktails, Al, we're being very festive in your honor. Cocktails? That's class, all right. Have some nuts? Sure. Thanks. Oh. Daddy, Al's here! Where? Right there. Al, you old no-good marine. How are you? Boy... Gee, it's good to see you again. Isn't it great to have him back? Am I glad you could make it for Christmas with us. Me, too. Al? Here's your gun, Al. Thought you might like to see how clean I kept it. Put it down, dear, he doesn't want it right now. Here's your drink, Al. Oh, thanks. Now, you go on upstairs and get cleaned up. I won't have my dinner spoiled. No, dear. There, you see that, Al? I'm still henpecked. Ha ha. Sounds it. I'm having a cocktail too, Al... ginger ale and grape juice. Same old stuff, huh? You betcha. There's some new boys up the block. Kinda rough, but I found a smooth one. Ha ha. I bet you did. We have a super tree this year, Al. Almost touches the ceiling. Swell. You want me to tell you what's on it? Never mind. There's a great big star on top, and underneath... never mind, Loretta, I don't wanna hear about it! Oh, honey. Excuse me. Of course I want to hear about your Christmas tree. I'm just tired from the train, that's all. It's a nice tree. Lots of colored lights. Sure, honey, sure. Forgive me. In a minute, you can tell me all about it, huh? All right. I forgive you. Thanks. How was your trip, Al? Ok. Every state sounded alike. Your old room's all ready. It's got new wallpaper. I did it myself. It's a little lumpy, but it's clean. Sorry, Jim, I've got other plans. I'm going to Chicago, to live with my brother. Oh, I, uh... didn't know that. Well, I'll see you in a minute, folks. I gotta help Ella Mae in the kitchen. But, Al... yeah? I thought you were going to stay here and marry Ruth. Loretta and I have talked everything over, Al. She's quite grown up now. I'll say I am. Too big to give me a kiss? Big girls kiss, too. Mm, you've been practicing. Uh-huh. On stevie, the smooth boy I told you about. Ha ha. It felt smooth, too. Al? You're not different, are you? Of course he's not. Ma says all soldiers come back different. She said you'd be different, too. I'm a little different, I suppose. No, you're not. Can't see Loretta's Christmas tree, can I? I can't see you. Doesn't that make me different? No, I don't mean your eyes. I mean you. You're not different. No? No... I think you're just the same. I can tell. Thanks. Ok, kids, come and get it. Dining room still in the same place? Sure. Am I sittin' where I always used to? Yes, right next to Ella Mae. Watch me make this on my own. There. You see? There have been 20 babies born on this block since you left, Al. Guess that always happens in wartime. Train whistle still go at night? Sure. Bet you didn't remember to light the candles, did you? Oh, dear, no. Here you are. Remember me, Ella Mae? The best little candle-lighter in Philadelphia. There. Al, there's a blind fellow working at our factory now. Loretta, stop reaching for things. Haven't you got a tongue? Sure, Mom. But my arm's longer. It's time for you to take your present to stevie now. Go upstairs and get our coats. This blind fellow I was telling you about went to a school. You know, it's a funny thing, al, but... he can feel those small rises better than I can see 'em. It's God's tRuth. How does he get to the plant? By bus. Somebody takes him, huh? Oh, no, he goes by himself. Al, I went to see mr. Davidson last week, and he said that if you'd go to the same school for a couple of months, you could have your old job back anytime you wanted. He did, eh? Yes. Well, it just doesn't fit in with my plans. I lit the Christmas tree lights. I'm all ready, Mom. We promised to drop in on these neighbors of ours. Their youngster has a crush on Loretta, and he's sick. We won't be gone long. I'll give you my present tonight if you stay, Al. Ok. There's some beer in the icebox. Help yourself. Thanks. We'll be right back. Now, don't you dare touch those dishes. All right. You're gonna love my present. It's just what you've always wanted. Swell, Loretta. Shall we go into the living room, Al? Sure. I don't need any help. I can find my way around this house blindfolded. Peace on the earth, goodwill to men turn the radio off, will you, Ruth? It's some kids outside. The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing for lo, the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old... I want you to take me to the hospital. Now. But you said you... I said I'd stay because I didn't want any arguments. Now I want to go. Loretta will be awfully upset. Am I going to have my life run by Loretta? I wouldn't have been stuck here in the first place if it hadn't been for that kid. Now, don't blame her. I brought you here. Then get me out. Al, I want one fair chance to talk to you, and you've got to give it to me. Ok, you can talk your head off. There's nothing you can say I ain't said to myself a thousand times. What's the use? You don't know what I want to say. You don't even think of me. Always trying to run the whole world by yourself. Don't pull any tears on me. That's why I didn't want to see you in the first place. I'm not pulling any tears on you. You didn't want to see me because you love me. Yet you're ready to let some fool idea in your head wreck both of us. Ruth, I'm helpless. I'd be a drag on you all your life. Why don't you let me decide that? Because I'm nobody's lap dog, that's why. You think I want to live out my life knowing every day of the year you married me out of pity? I got too much pride for that. I'd rather live alone. Pride... you haven't got any pride! You just tell yourself that. You haven't got enough pride to face the tRuth. Virginia told you about the jobs. You could get hundreds of them. But you didn't want to learn one. You want to be lonely. You want to feel sorry for yourself! You wanna be helpless! You haven't got the pride to accept being blind like a man. Get me out of here! I won't. Get in that car and drive me. I won't. You're going to stay here and listen to me. I won't drive you. That's fine. That's great. That ties it up. I could beat your ears off for saying that. But you missed one card... I may be blind, but I know where the phone is in this house. I'm calling a cab! Al! I don't need any help. Please leave me alone. Oh, Al, don't be hurt. I've gotta go get that cab. If you go out of this room now, you'll leave me to stumble all through my life the way you just did. I don't pity you, Al. I love you. Suppose there never was a war, darling. What if we were married and one day I got hit by a car and was left a cripple... would you walk out on me? No, you wouldn't. Darling, my heart's been falling over things all year because you've been gone. I need you, Al. Sure you'll need me, too. What's wrong with that? Why shouldn't two people need each other? I know these last months have been awful for you, sweetheart. And it's only because you're fine and decent that you're afraid of being a burden to me. But you won't be, not you, Al. You can work. We can have a family. Sure, we'll have a problem, but everyone has problems. All married couples do. People can't let each other down because of that. I don't know what I'll do if you leave me now. I need you too much. Ruthie, don't. I don't want to make you cry. It's just that I was an ordinary guy before, and I wasn't worth you then. And now, I'm less than an ordinary guy. I can't see. Less than ordinary. You? Oh, sweetheart, don't you realize that every single man who's fought is no longer ordinary? Don't you realize that millions and millions of people were looking to Guadalcanal every day when you were fighting there? They were, millions of them. Every civilized person in the world, I guess. It wasn't any ordinary guy who kept the japs back that night. It was one of the most extraordinary fellows in the world. You... al Schmid. South pacific force of the United States pacific fleet, headquarters of the commander. In the name of the president of the United States, the commander, south pacific area and south pacific force, takes pleasure in presenting the navy cross to private albert a. Schmid. 350951, United States marine corps reserve, for service as set forth in the following citation. "For extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession as machine-gunner "in the action against a strong japanese landing force "in the solomon islands on august 21, 1942. "Schmid's machine-gun squad was attacked by the enemy. "Lacking the protection of riflemen, "it was necessary for the squad "to tear down their frontal protection, "in order to meet the oncoming enemy. "Under the greatest difficulties, "the enemy attack was met and repulsed. "In the action, Schmid was seriously wounded. "His courage, intrepidity, and fortitude contributed largely to the defeat of the enemy. " W.F. Halsey. Admiral, U.S. Navy. I congratulate you, Schmid. I'm mighty proud, sir. That was wonderful, Al. Let's get that cab with the red top on. How do you know it's red? Its kind of fuzzy, but it's red, ain't it? Yes, darling, it is red. Now, look, honey, don't get your hopes up. That doesn't mean I'm gonna see good again. Whichever way it is, we'll do it together. Where to, folks? Home.
