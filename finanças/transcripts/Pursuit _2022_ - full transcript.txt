I love you, Rick. Get off me. Let's go. Don't worry about falling. Here, go on. Go on. All right! Thank you, Grandpa. Life's short, brother. Let's do this. I asked for weight. Oh, yeah, this isn't cotton candy, brah. It's Dance Fever. Fentanyl. Cut this shit a hundred to one, and they come back begging for more. No, no. Our deal was for meth. Papi, you can make triple the money. Fine. Let's go. No, goddammit! Come on. Reggie's at Radio City tomorrow. Front row tickets. Heard you were a fan. My gift. You crazy, man. Okay. But I accept your gift. Not again. Shots fired, shots fired! Send backup! We're clear! Take it, take it. Take it, take it, take it. I'm not here for your trash, Sal. Where's my wife? You touched her. Ella... Ella está con Manos de Rosas. Don't move! Move, move, get out, get out! Go, go, go, go, go! Get back inside! NYPD! Police. I'm coming out! - Don't move. - No, no, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot, don't shoot. - Where's the other shooter? - What other shooter? Hey, over here. Hey! Jerk. Freeze! You can drive if you like. Fuck! - Bye. - Give me the toy. No, no, dinner time. Come on. Thank you, Frank. You let me know when you have time to talk with Rick. He should know the truth about his wife. Yeah, I'll have a talk with him. He's still grieving. Hardly been two weeks. Best we all move on, Jack. Here's the pepperoni. Now we're getting serious. Pepperoni one. Pepperoni two. Pepperoni three. Pepperoni seven. Pepperoni four. Here, a couple of olives. - Here. - You need more pepperoni on there. I know, he stopped at four. You keep this young squire in line. Here, sprinkle some of this on there. I was surprised to see Frank. I mean, there was a raid this morning. You know how he gets when we lose product. - Yeah. - Troopers seized a lot of weight. Uh... Here's... Jack, I didn't get no warning from Biggs. The ambitions of a mediocre man? He's making moves and we had an arrangement. Well, we can't have people running around unsupervised. - All right, I'll make some calls. - Yeah. Send another message. Jack, I'm sorry to interrupt. It's about Rick. Hello. Breslin. Your shrink called this morning. Suggested a bereavement leave. And what did you say? I can't afford to lose a good cop. You're saying I'm a good cop? You're a work in progress. Put a Band-aid on it, big guy? Oh, yeah, hearts and rainbows. Still warm? Oh, always you, always you. - Thanks, Cap. - Yeah. Oye! I want a lawyer. I have rights! You'd have rights if you were an American citizen. No, no, no, bullshit. This is bullshit! Who is he? Why the fuck you asking me for? Don't you have computers and shit? Facial recognition? Oh, it seems this man's a ghost. No fingerprints, no records. Those computers you're talking about have found nothing. Sal, when you go missing, in Cuba is there anyone that will even care? Okay, caballito. But I have to ask you something. Were those front row tickets real? Best seats in the house. This is Rick Calloway. He's a hacker. One of the best. That's the reason he doesn't exist. He would be a very big deal for you guys to catch. Young kid like you, looking to make his mark? He knows many, many things. All the way to the top. Where is he? I don't know. No one really knows. We cut a deal... and I will tell you where he's going. Sorry, Dad, I'm busy. Son, are you okay? So I just took the test and... We've got some news. - You tell 'em. - On three. One, two, three. We're pregnant! Okay, I'm glad you said we and not just me. Is it weird when you say we're pregnant? - It's ours. - 'Cause I'm the one who's pregnant. We gotta think of names ASAP. I'm so excited. You're gonna be a dad. It's gonna be a boy, right? I don't know. I'm wearing pink, - so maybe it's a sign. - It is a sign. No, no, no! Go ahead. Grandpa, where's my dad? He's gonna be here soon, I promise. Now make a wish and blow out the candles. Make a wish. Take a deep breath, make a wish. Go on. Okay. - Yay! - Yeah! I saw his face. The guy is fucking nuts, okay? He killed my guys, and then came asking about Rachel with a gun to my head. What the fuck, man? I did what you asked. You said, "He knew what was going on." What did you tell the police, Sal? Nothing, I didn't tell them nothing, 'cause they had... they saw video of Rick shooting at me. He's careless. What the fuck, man? I made bail and I expect your help out of here. I have to go. I have to go to Mexico or Colombia. You owe me! Relax, Sal, we'll take care of it, all right? Who else knows? Frank. Of course he does. Fucking mess. All right. I'll call Frank, and, uh... you go get him and bring him home. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Jack? Just left your house. I am not too happy. I just heard your son's been shooting up our boys. Thought you had a handle on that. He's my son, I'll take care of this. Yeah, well, you better, Jack. If I have to get involved, it could get real messy. Oh, I love these freaky drug bitches. What's up? You wanna come to my club? Come on, get in there. Come here. You looking for a little bit of Molly? - Maybe. - A little bit of Tina? - Maybe. - I got a table, VIP section. Tell them Manos de Rosas sent you. Bunch of little nasty bitches. No, no, no. Don't bullshit me, come on. No. Hey! You wanna move this little bullshit out the way, please? Hey, would you... Oh, shit, it's a bitch. What's up? - Oh, hey, baby. How you doing? - What's up? Your titty game is all right. Uh, your daddy can't come in, though. We got enough men. - Oh, that's fine. - Fuck! What the fuck? Everyone move in! Get the fuck out of here. Where's my wife? I ain't telling you a fucking thing. Okay, okay, look. Hey, look. All right, okay. I was moving her, all right? I put her on a truck to fucking Little Rock. Some dude named Diego wanted her. Frank or John? Come on, man. I told you everything I know. It's your last chance. Diego, Diego! Fuck, fuck. Hello, Detective Breslin. Put the gun down, Rick. Am I under arrest? I asked you to come alone. Yeah, why am I here? I mean, you have, uh... what is it, D? Three lawyers. And they all say, you're not talking, so... Yeah, lawyers. Um, well, uh... I know who murdered Shannon, your wife. Tell me their names. We make a deal. I'm being transferred to Arkansas, and a very powerful man has put a half million dollar hit on my head. Yeah, I really don't feel sorry for you. He's a cheap bastard. My-my point is, keep me alive during the transfer, and I will not only give you the-the keys to said "powerful man's" empire, but, more importantly, I will... I will give you the names of those who murdered your wife. Three men... and one woman threw her over a balcony. I'm sorry. She-she was pregnant. She was gonna have a boy. - You're a sick fuck. - I'm sorry. Mike. - I'm sorry. - Mike. All right, burn it in here, man. That was a good... that was a good one. Good fast ball. Maybe I could be a pitcher. Why not? Jack, he's here. How about-how about a... a second baseman? Get in front of the ball. That's a good play. Here. - Thank you. - Play with Lily for a while? He's getting good. John. Disappointed to see me? No, not at all. I'm always delighted to see you. You look like you could use a drink. - Would you like one? - Please. Let me get one for you. How's your grandmother? Oh, uh, she's, um... about as well as she can be. She's a kind a woman. Hmm. She's keeping her sense of humor. - Is she? - Yeah. Good. It's good to see you, kid. Salud. What's on your mind? Um... Three more drop houses in New York were raided this morning. Yeah, I know. Frank believes Rick is talking. I got the best lawyers in New York - who assure me he is not. - Yeah. There's a lot of product that was seized, Jack. It's not... it's not like a small deal. - It's... - Hey. - It's, uh... - I'm well aware of the problem. Come on, spit it out. I know it was Rick. - You personally know? - Yes. - Rick has been sending... - Hey, hey, hey, hold on a minute. How do you know? Rick has been sending information to my father. What kind of information? Personal information, Jack, that my father has no business knowing. Hmm. I understand. Okay, so it's Rick's... sending Frank pictures of you and your boyfriend. I mean, that's a violation of your personal sovereignty, but how the fuck does that mean he's talking to the Feds? Because I value our friendship, - it's important that I come here... - Hold that thought. - ...to tell you your face... I have to. - Hold that thought. I'll get you a refill. That was the cheap stuff. We can get the good stuff here, okay? Now... What would be in it for him? I don't know. I don't know, but it's done. Detective Carter. Our transport's this way. I, um, I need to use the-the restroom. You got one minute, little guy. Be quick. First time in Little Rock? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Are you okay? Breslin. This way. Adam-4, code 8. Black Sedan heading north east. The getaway vehicle you all reported was a family of four scared out of their wits. All right, look, Rick Calloway is a bit of a wanted man around here. Hell, come tomorrow, I'll find him strung up on a bridge somewhere, and I'll call you when I do. Detective... Go back to New York. You're done here. Thank you, Sheriff. Hey. Breslin. A word? Chief Taye Biggs, Arkansas State Troopers. I heard what happened to your partner. I assure you we're gonna do everything we can to find out what the hell happened. I'd like to stick around to help. All right. All right, we can do that. We already have some history here with Carter, so we're gonna let you act as liaison with my office. All right? In the meantime, why don't you go get some shuteye, and then we can talk? And just so you know, this is my jurisdiction. Huh? You got it. Truck's over here. You all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. You? Just lost one of my best friends. I'm not sure how I am. So you're a sheriff? Yes, sir. You look like you just got out of the academy. Huh, I was thinking the same thing about you. Okay, yeah, all right, I understand. I'm actually, uh, the first person in my family to graduate college. Arkansas State. Got a degree in criminal justice, applied to Lonoke PD, worked that for a couple years, and applied for sheriff. You wanna know why Biggs put you to spy on me? Sure. Diminished responsibility. I have another theory. What's that? Well, you see, I have this, like, special ability, right? I can, um... I can tolerate assholes. - Oh. - So. Ouch. Pretty sure that had something to do with it. Well, we'll see if he's right or not. I guess we will. Uh... So, when will I see my, uh, father? Oh, okay. Yeah. - Oh, I don't. - Sí. Thanks, I don't smoke. Yeah, you really shouldn't do that. The tobacco corporations are conglomerates that cause mass death, see? Yeah, see, I, uh... I don't smoke tobacco, but, uh, I do like mota. - Uh. Okay, yeah. - I like that. Yeah. Wow, you got pretty good stuff, huh? I guess that's part of the cartel perk. So, uh... I'm gonna have a bad high, huh? Yeah. I got you. - The whole thing is a clusterfuck. - That hurt! - Well, you have your son involved. - Uh-huh. Biggs told NYPD to stick around. - Get Dodge over there. - He is. All right. - All right, and then get Frank on the phone. - I'm on it. - Come on, Papa, let's play. - I gotta work for a while. You go play with Lily, yeah? When are my parents coming to get me? - Lily! - Hey. - Come on, baby. - Frank. He doesn't wanna talk to you, Jack. Tell them nothing moves until we talk. - You sure that's smart? - Yep. They're having the body flown to Jersey tomorrow. The family asked if you would carry the flag. I won't be back in time. You need anything? Styles and some gear. Mike, make sure whoever did this knows not to fuck with the NYPD. Morning. Breakfast tacos? Eggs and tortilla? Yeah, sure. Something like that. Thank you. You said "taco." Yes, I did. This is a burrito. You know, I went to New York once... and, um, when I asked for hot sauce, they brought me ketchup. What flavor? Heinz 57. Move over. Move over, man. - Hey. - Hey, stop! Stop it! What the... Sit down, sit down. Sit down. George, Breslin, NYPD. NYPD? I thought he'd be older, or bigger, or somethin'. What up, little white boy? You got some cars to work on or something? - You got some people to shoot for no reason? - Okay. - George is my CI. - Hey, I'm no one's anything. I do what I do when I do to survive. The perks ain't bad neither. What the fuck is this? What can you tell us about Rick Calloway? - Shit, I don't know nothing. - George, I'm not playing. Come on. Frank Diego made a hit on him for about 500 grand. Word is, crews are lined up all down the highway to take the fool down, but somebody got to him first. - Who? - Fuck if I know. But everybody's still looking, because the hit's still open and the price has been upped. How much? One million dollars. On one hit. Let's pay his father a visit. - Jack Calloway? - Yep. No, we'd need Biggs to approve that. If Rick's not dead, Jack has him. Oh, shit! Little white boy talk like he knows something, huh? Listen, Frank Diego make a hit, even Jesus Christ himself can't stop it. Nah, brah, Pops sitting home with his mouth shut, waiting to identify the body. Now you shut your goofy ass up. Don't come by here no more. You're gonna get me fucked up. Is that Simon, your favorite right there? Hey, don't-don't use too much food. Why not? 'Cause some creatures don't know when to stop eating. Do their bellies explode? Jack, it's Frank. Frank, Frank, Frank. We lost another location this morning. That's five this week. I know, I know, I heard. It's not Rick. Where's your son, Jack? Who has him? You tell me. I mean, with a fucking half a million dollar price on his head, what the fuck did you expect was gonna happen? He's gonna run. I'd expect somebody to collect that money. Now I'll bring him in, Frank, and it's not Rick. Let me handle my son, please. Nah, it's too late for that, Jack. Frank... I'm asking you as a friend, please. Hello, son. Sit down. Have a seat. Manuel. Dig in. So... where's Rick? Uh, I don't know. No, no, no, hey! What are you doing? Dad? Don't bullshit me, boy. Dad, stop! I don't care who you're fucking, boy, as long as it's not me. Now get up and go find Rick. You go after him. Make sure he does what I say. - Sorry, he's busy. - Just a short visit, Paul. - For my sake. - Come back with a warrant. All right, I'm not that busy. - Hello, Biggs. - Hey, Jack. Listen, when your son was taken, one of NYPD was killed, and they just... they got a couple of questions for you. Okay. Mr. Calloway, I'm Detective Mike Breslin, and, uh, we're looking for your son Rick. Yeah, well, I haven't seen him, uh, and he has been home for years. Oh. Well, you know, if my son came to town with a hit on his head, I would wanna make sure that he was safe. Well, we had a falling out many years ago and we don't talk. What about his wife? Where is she? She left him, um... so if you find her, let us know. So she's missing? No, we care about her. Do you have her contact info? No, I don't. And other than that... I would say have a great day. And if you wanna come back, call the lawyers, yeah? Thank you, Jack. Rick's not here. How do you know? Oh, just a hunch. Listen, I got something to do. I'll see you back at the station. - Yes, sir. - All right. That's a nice ride. You know, I had one back in college. How old are you again? It was a fixer-upper, Carter. Okay. Isn't time I start searching for Rick? Bring him home? Jack. Hey, I just got the system booted. Hi. Officer Carter. She's good, Styles. Excuse me. You know, I had to pull off some serious fucking favors to get this shit together. How the hell did you get that? Ask Detective Nunya. And there's Rick Calloway. Wait, go back a bit. Who is that? That's Dodge. Where I can find Dodge on a Friday night? Jimmy Doyle's. I'll pick you up in an hour, okay? - Sure. - Oh, and, uh, Breslin, make sure you have your dancing boots on, okay? How long can we track them after injection? Two days, then it dissipates. Do you even own cowboy boots?

Listen, there's a car out front. There's a passport and some cash in the trunk. Go. Jack won't be calling back. I need to know something. The photos that you sent my father... Where'd you get 'em? Uh... Where'd you get the photos? Rick. Grindr, I don't know. MySpace, uh, Twitter? Get the bags. - How many bags? - Two. No, um, ahem, three. We're gonna keep your head on ice, Rick. And then my father's gonna stuff your head with explosives. And then we're gonna send it to your son for his next birthday. Boom. Don't-don't you think that's a little immature? Fuck your dad. What do you care? Yeah, you're gay. You like guys, who gives a fuck? Fuck your dad. Ha. - Let's go. - Grow up! Well, okay, you got us all out here. You wanna tell me what's going on? Rick Calloway's been sending me emails with information since his arrest. This morning I received a list of addresses here in Lonoke. All right, I'll go fish. Where do we start? Here. If Rick's anywhere, it's there. It's closest to the airport. All right. All right, y'all, let's load up. I'll ride with Will. My father likes to watch. Jack, Frank called. They found Rick. I'm sorry, man. It's over. Please don't. I swear, I-I don't... Go, go, go! - You okay? - Yeah. Holy shit! That's a lot of dough. Carter, we gotta go. There's an emergency at your mom's house. No, no, don't, don't. Mom. Are you okay? Are you okay? - I'm okay, baby. Just look inside. - Are you sure? - Did they hurt you? - No, I'm okay. - Okay. - I'm okay. - You stay right here, okay? All right. - Okay. It was Dodge. How do you know? Styles has been keeping an eye on him for me. The reason why Biggs assigned you to me is because I'm expendable. My famil is expendable. You wanna find Rick, get in. Where is my wife? Styles, do you have a visual on Dodge? Dodge is home. Looks like he's making lunch. Keep an eye on him. Yes, sir. Fuck me. Motherfucker! - You okay? - I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Slow deep breaths. Come on. He's getting away. Let's just stay calm. Don't ever tell a woman that. Adam 12. Go for Adam 12. There's a 245 at the Broadway Inn. Back up requested. You're gonna need to drive. First time? Frank! Frank, there's something you should see now. Remember, fishing takes patience, boys. John sent the live feed of Calloway, like you asked. It cut out for a bit, but when it came back... - Get the car. - Yes, sir. Uh, can we get a car at the northeast corner of Main and Fifth? Over. All cars in the area, respond immediately. Jack, you there? I found your car. Bring it home. All right. My father, he, um... he wasn't a very good cop. I found him one morning washing blood off of his hands that wasn't his. He tried to explain but I... I didn't wanna believe him. You're a good man, Breslin. But if you don't leave, this town will eat you alive. That... that'd be all. Thank you. No, didn't see a goddamn thing. The-the cameras are off. - Let me talk to 'em. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now they're afraid. These people killed cops. What's to keep 'em from killing a motel manager and his family? Jesus! And, oh! Now I ran the rest of the houses on your list. You got city council members on there, you got Sheriff Dodge. Jack Calloway's on that list, for God's sakes. Mike, we know who the bad guys are, all right? And they-they-they know where my grandkids go to school, all right? They know where my wife works. They know where my mom is. It's a give and take down here, okay? It's not an easy fix. Now the only thing they saw was a late model Mustang driving away after the gunfire. Mike, that could be anybody! Goddamn! - Now I gotta go after him. - I'm going too. Talk to me. They found Rick. Dodge is bringing him here now. I confirmed Jack was hiding him. Then kill Jack Calloway. I'll pay you double whatever he's paying you. But I want his son for myself. With pleasure. Come on, get up. Hello, Rick. You should have taken my deal. - Let's go. - Ow. Mike, you need to think about this. You have no backup and these guys aren't afraid to fight. Your mother used to sing to you, every night when you were a baby, with the cicadas, while I was cooking dinner. Dad... Yeah. Where is Troy? Well, there's a carnival in town. He wanted to ride the rollercoaster. Get my boy down! Shh... Daddy... Daddy's here. Daddy's here, don't move. Funny, 'cause, um, John... told me about Rachel, and I... John told you about it? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. The whole story. I know the truth now. It's okay, boy. It's gonna be all right. Help me pick him up. I know the truth. Come on, John doesn't know shit. Rachel made a deal with the DEA. Frank found out about it and he had Dodge handle her. That's what happened. It was you. What are you doing? Well, we don't have a warrant. I gotta make a few calls. Carter! Goddamn it! Carter! Get help! Go get help! Run, run, Dad. Run, run, run, please, run. What-what's wrong? Dad, run! Run, Dad! I loved her. You fucked up! She was afraid of you! Hello! Freeze! You kill me, and they'll fry you. You feel it, right? You feel when somebody you love betrays you. She was afraid of you, bubba. She was afraid of you and me. - That's the truth. - You're... kind of a dick. Just don't lie to my grandson. Mike, stop. What are you doing? You gonna tell him, Zoe? I'm sorry, Mike. Zoe here, she'll do anything for her family. Isn't that right, Zoe? Shoot him, Zoe. Shoot him now, Zoe. Do it. Zoe. Zoe, you better shoot him. Whose side are you on, Zoe? Zoe! Zoe! You better shoot him now! We blame this whole thing on Dodge, yeah? It's gonna rain. Fuck. What the fuck?! What... Yo, Rick, I... it wasn't my fault. I didn't... I didn't wanna do it. Grief feels... so much like fear. Frank made me, man! I-I didn't wanna do it! I didn't, I swear! I swear everything, I tried to not do. I-I tried to fight. I'll-I will do anything. Come on, man! I'm saying please! You know... I'm not being sarcastic when I tell you that I... I absolutely think that this is gonna be the best thing that ever happened to you. Yeah, just think of it as a golden opportunity. Yeah. No, no, come on, Rick! Don't do this! Rick, come on, please! Please, don't do this! Please, Rick, please! Rick, no! Come on, please! Please, don't do this! Please, Rick, please! - Troy? - Dad! Rick! I never wanna see you again! Hey, buddy. How are you? Good. - It's raining a lot, huh? - Yeah. - Do you want a full-time job? - Absolutely. 'Cause I gotta... I gotta tell you that I... I pay a pretty good rate. Let's get out of here, huh? Are you gonna have a belly? We've had a hit. I'm forwarding the location to you now. He's in Mexico City. Yeah. I'm so excited. You're gonna be dad. It's gonna be a boy, right? - So maybe it's a sign It's a girl. - It is a sign. I'm just kidding. - On three. - One, two, three. We're pregnant!
