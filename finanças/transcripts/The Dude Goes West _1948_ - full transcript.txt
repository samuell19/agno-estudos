The Texas Jack Rival (1948) -Where's that, grandpa? -Is this the wild west? Oh, I can say it was the wildest in the wild west. In just a week, they buried 57 temperamental gentlemen in Arsenic City. For arsenic poisoning, grandpa? Lead poisoning. - Was that you, grandpa? -No son. - That was Buffalo Bill. -He was a cowboy, wasn't he? Certainly. -Isn't that you, grandpa? -No son. - That was Calamity Jane. -She was also a "cowboy"? -Were you a cowboy, grandpa? -Certainly. -Is that you, grandpa? -Is that you grandpa? Now... Yes. -You don't look like a cowboy. -To say the truth, at that time I was not, children. This photo was taken in 1876. We still had the store in Brooklyn. They hadn't even finished building the Brooklyn Bridge. My father, your great-grandfather, owned that store for 40 years. I was raised in it. But he was dead and I was getting ready to leave. Mrs. Hallahan, the landlady, did not understand why I wanted to leave. She had been like a mother to me. She wanted me to stay. But you can't go, the west is a terrible place. Full of wild women and outlaws. But I am a gunsmith, lady. I make a living repairing weapons. There are no more guns to fix in Brooklyn. That place became America's garden. Hey, Dan. We were playing police and thief. Frank was the thief and I was the policeman. I caught him in the act. But the gun stuck. So, he shot me. And it killed me. It seems to have released the trigger spring. -Do you have a fuze? -Of course. -She shoots to the right. -I'll remember that. Thank you, Dan. Thank you very much. Repairing fuze revolver for free. This is what Brooklyn had become. Daniel. - You forgot that. -Oh, the pipe. Wow. If I had forgotten that, I would have forgotten everything .. -But you don't smoke. -of course not. Thank you for everything, Mrs. Hallahan. -Bye. -Bye. I almost forgot about Mr. Brittle. He had been a real friend. He lent me a lot of books. Once, he even let me read an encyclopedia I had. Well, goodbye, Mr. Brittle. I'm going to Arsenic City. I hate to see you go, Dan, Arsenic City. That is a bad place, than Deadwood or Dodge City. But a good place to open a business. As an undertaker? You read the Nevada governor's report in the newspaper. They took $ 50,000 in gold from Arsenic City in two weeks. Where there is gold there are weapons. After all, I'm a gunsmith. Yes, and a great reader. Your problem is that you never read between the lines, Dan. -And the outlaws and Indians? -What about the Indians? They say they cut a man's hair close. No longer. According to President Grant's latest report, the Indians are under control. You are a great reader, son. Well, goodbye and good luck. Goodbye, Mr. Brittle. Goodbye, Dan. Goodbye, Danny. There goes a great reader. Yes sir. A great reader. CUSTER AND COMMAND MASSACRATED BY THE SIOUX. West is where the west begins. Where bonfires send greetings to calm the hearts of all strangers. Where the golden sunset kisses the sky. Where it is easy to live and hard to die. The wild Indian is very superstitious. It prevents a whirlwind in the desert why do you think it contains a mysterious spirit, whose path he must not cross under penalty of death. Oh, the poor Indian. -Hello Neighbor. -Hi. You have your book open since I got on the train. -Like to read, huh? -My father always told me... There is an answer to everything in a book. Indigenous Sign Language. By Professor Richard Fort, PhD. Massachusetts University. This is good. How would a man in Massachusetts know something about indigenous language? Now they don’t have red skin in the state since the pilgrims they played Plymouth Rock on them. Got the joke? Hey, do you want some tobacco? is my own brand. No thank you. I do not smoke. -That's a pipe, isn't it? -Yes, it was my father's. Sentimental memory? He also didn't smoke. Kansas City. Kansas City. Last stop. All passengers heading west will move to Central Pacific at the station. This is your car, sir. I already took your luggage. -I appreciate it. -Thank you sir. That's what I meant. Troublemakers like that. Wow, grandma. He can hear you. It does not matter to me. Now, behave and stay tuned. Don't talk to strangers and never drop your bag. I'll be careful, grandma. And never trust a man. -You trusted grandpa, didn't you? -Of course not. Don't worry grandma. We bought an entire section so that I had privacy. You know, I feel like I shouldn't let you go. You know, I don't approve of mixed trips. You know that the railroad has made these trips respectable. -You read about it. -Even so. When ladies and gentlemen sleep on the same train, something can happen. And if after you go to bed... All aboard! Curse. Bye, grandma. -Bye, honey. -Bye. All aboard! -Thank you sir. -It was a pleasure, lady. Hey. Are you also going to Arsenic City? What a coincidence. I board a train in New York en route to Arsenic City and you go up to Kansas City on the way to the same place. -What do you think about this? -I didn't think... For a big country, the world is small, isn't it? Do you know what the chances are of meeting like this? About 100,000 to 1. It's not like Arsenic City is a city like New York. After all, it's nothing more... If you forgive my expression, a hole in the earth. -Well, I... -By the way... Excuse me lady. -Is that coyote bothering you? -Thank you sir. It's all right. Let us not create a problem. Listen, newbie. Around here, a man doesn't start a conversation with a lady, unless it is formally presented. -Do you know her? -Not. You seem to be doing the same. Look here. One more thing, newbie. Here, when you take out a man you use a gun. -Not a pipe. -What's going on here? -A flirt. -Look here, sir. Take care of your manners on that train or we'll kick you off at the next stop. Understood? Who? I? Do not pretend, sir. I find your type on every trip. Coming and going. Go back to your seat and stay there. Sorry lady. I hope it doesn't happen again. You can be sure of that. Please take care of your belongings and do not disturb sleeping passengers. Please take care of your belongings and do not disturb sleeping passengers. -Good night, Mr. Driver. -Good night, lady. Sir, can I have the stairs please? Thanks. Surveillance, Miss. Crockett. Do not fear. The watchdog never sleeps. -Good night. -Good night. Are we on time, driver? Of course. Always on time. Well, it's one more that won't worry us. -What happened? - Train thief. Attacking everyone. He is dead. - Taking a train is not healthy. -But you can't shoot a man like that. I shot, newbie. But he was unarmed. He didn't stand a chance. -His chance was not to be caught. -But... - Couldn't I have arrested him? -He's not going anywhere. West is where the west begins. Where bonfires send greetings to calm the hearts of all strangers Where the golden sunset kisses the sky. Where it is easy to live and difficult... Sunday services are available in the last car for all passengers who want to attend. Driver, aren't we close to Devil's Canyon? In two minutes. But we don't stop there, sir. -It's just a landscape. -I know. I'll be right back, Miss. Crockett. Your thief. Who? I? You understood all wrong. It was Pecos. -I didn't find it in his hand. -No, he got it. - He jumped off the train. -How would I do when I got you. Got me... What do you think about this? You are ungrateful. I saved your damn bag, -I almost died. -Don't swear. -I didn't curse... -I heard what you said. Wait a second. Thank God. If I had missed this, I would have lost everything. What is so important? Do you mind? My God. You would think it is a map of a gold mine or something. -You looked. -Me what? -You opened my bag and looked. - I didn't do any of that. -Made Yes. -I didn't open your bag. Now, I wish I never saw that damn thing. -Don't swear. -I'm not cursing. -Everything I said... -I heard what you said. Now, you can get out of here and leave me alone, -or should i call the driver? -I'll get out of here when I'm ready. And are you ready? Let me guarantee you, Miss. Crockett, that there is still decorum in this company. Applied if necessary. What do you think of this transfer? Got it, Pecos? He was with me, even fighting with a newbie. -Kiki won't like that. -She doesn't worry me. That rookie, yes. I have to resolve something with him. -You will never see him again. -Of course I will see you Arsenic City. He owes me a gun. I owe you a bullet. Let's go. -Can I help you, lady? -Oh thank you. A man named Hotchkiss should find me. Are you talking about Horace Hotchkiss from Arsenic City? Yes that's right. I wrote to him two weeks ago, and said it was coming. Two weeks ago, huh? Madam, you must be optimistic. Your letter will only arrive in Carson City in two weeks. We are a month late. I see that Mr. Hotchkiss has not heard from you yet. What I'll do? How will I get to Arsenic City? It is better to go to the company to buy a stagecoach ticket. If you can get one. I can avoid the job, Miss, Crockett. Tickets are booked for the next 3 weeks. I didn't ask you for advice. So, you want a cart, huh? What do you think of the baker's wagon? I received it as payment yesterday. Selling you for $ 50. dollars. -What do you say to paint it? -Good... I want you to paint my name. Okay, son. Go to the barn, buy a horse and bring your luggage. When it's over, maybe it's painted. Thank you. -What do you want painted? -Just put Daniel Bone, gunsmith. Daniel Bone, gunsmith. This is not a chicken, so it costs $ 20. dollars. -I do not know. -She is a good mare. It creates no problem and eats little. What will I do? I mean... -How will I take care of her? -When she's thirsty, give him water. When you're hungry, give him oats. -Move to walk and stop. -Closed. I want you to deliver it to the wagon shop. But listen, when she's tired don't let her see you in this hat. SUPPLIES FOR RANCHEIROS Wow. What clothes. When I grow up, I'll buy a top hat like that. A glass of beer. Two for me. Three of kings. It's a shame, Briggs. This is not your day. Neither yours, sir. Don't touch that money. -What do you mean, Briggs? -Two of those aces didn't come out of the deck. -Are you calling me a cheater? - It's the least I will call you, sir. Do not shot. Come on. Let's get out of here. I want to thank you, son. Not that I couldn't handle it. You couldn't. The firing pin on your revolver is broken. -You have good eyes. -I'm a gunsmith. -Can you fix that revolver? -Of course. Let's go to my cart to get my tools. -You got a job. -Thanks. Come on, Manypearl. I don't want to argue with a man who did me a favor, but you can't shoot a man with a pipe. -He meant to kill you. -I intended to kill him. I've never seen a pipe that could shoot a man. My father did this, for General Grant. He served with him. When Grant became president, my father wanted to give him a gift. So you did it for him. But it was so perfect that he didn't want to get rid of it. I do not believe. Hey. -Not? -Not. I do not believe. Come on, Manypearl. She is loaded and ready to go. This is the wagon. Mr. James, you wrote my name wrong. Of course not. It's B-O-N-E. Bone. -No Boone. -What difference does? I prefer Boone. Bone, it looks like dog food. Psychology, son. Boone looks more like a gunsmith. -But it's not my name. -You will only know that if you keep quiet. Nice wagon, son. Where will you work? -Arsenic City. - Going there now? -As soon as you fix your gun. - You don't have to hurry. What do you say I tie Manypearl in the back and go with you? -I need to go back to my mine. -I would be happy with your company. Good. Come on, Manypearl. Lets go Girl. My name is Sam Briggs. I am a friendly man, son. Let's go. Good luck, Boone. Hey, Miss. Crockett. I bought this cart. We're going to Arsenic City. If you want a ride, we can take you. I wouldn't ride with you even if I had to walk to Arsenic City. That's all you can do, walk. Come on, Gertrude. I mean, come on. Daniel knows if that woman had come, she would cook. And you would drink weak coffee. I learned to stay away from two things in the west. One is the rattlesnake. But she was beautiful. Yes sir. Very beautiful. What is her name again? Elizabeth Crockett. Crockett? I met a Crockett in Arsenic City. -Harry Crockett. -IT IS? We were good friends. He helped me more than once. He nailed it. -Come rich? -The biggest. -What happened to him? -It was ambushed. Dead? Alive is not. -And the rich one? - Lost forever. Wow. Yes son. So it is with gold. Blood is the color of gold. Well, here it is. I have finished. I do not believe. You were fast. And he did a beautiful job. You are not doing badly. I am so hungry that I would eat a cow's hide. What do you think you will eat? The food will be ready soon. You know, I used to play this. Go ahead. Feel free. That's enough, Daniel. This type of music attracts flies. Give it to me. Let me try this. Well, thanks for fixing my gun. Thanks for the guitar. Hey, I hope to see you again sometime. Oh, I'll be in Arsenic City in a day or two. Take care, Dan. Watch out for the Indians ahead. When you get to Arsenic City, stay tuned. How is she, Sam? Pure poison. Let's go guys. They are after me. Take the boys to the canyon. I will take you to the desert. -What is the problem? -I shot my leg, I lost my gun and my horse ran away scared. Take it easy. I will camp here. You will be fine. Look at that. It made a beautiful hole. I thank you for taking it out. You were lucky that I knew how. I read about it in a book. I love to read, you know? What is your name? In the west when a man wants you to know his name, -he tells you. -Yes I know. My name is Bone. Daniel Bone. Wrong on the cart. What is your? -Have you seen me before? -Not. Well, you can call me... -Texas. -Nice, Texas. Newbie, huh? Good... It depends on how you see it. I have a horse, a cart and food. I was not wandering through the desert, without water, after I lost my gun and with a bullet in the leg like some people. My coffee is also gone. I'll give you a little. You know, I've been thinking. How did you shoot yourself? Cleaning my gun. Texas. Well, I wasn't cleaning, I was holding it when I fired. Where's the other one? - Another one? -You have two holsters. Oh, I lost it a long time ago. That holster kept her shape, didn't it? Curse. I'll bring you a little more. Clumsy as an Indian. Daniel. A newbie like you should be more careful. You can take a man, like you got me. And maybe he's an outlaw on the run. -Do you know what would happen? -What Texas? He would tell you that you made a mistake, would cock the gun you picked up on your wagon and kill you. -That would also be a mistake. -Why? Why the gun is not loaded. -Of course it wasn't personal. -Not? No, I just wanted to show you what could have happened. Where did you get that gun? I took it from a man named Pecos on the Kansas City train. Did you take Pecos? What are you laughing about? Daniel took that gun from Pecos Kid, he must have been dead by the time. Oh no. We fought. -Do you know Pecos? -Good... He works for me sometimes. If I were you, I would find another man. He's very dishonest. He is the second best sniper in the entire state of Nevada. Do not. -Who is the best? I see it's me. You... What are you laughing about? Excuse me. You shot yourself in the leg, lost your gun, almost died in the desert and tells me he's the best sniper... Just give me some bullets and I'll show you. It's all right. I'll do it. I'll compete with you. Here it is. We will see. We need a target. We need? Of course, we need a target. -I already chose mine. -Wait a minute. One dollar. I'll put it on a branch. You have the courage to take that risk. What would you think if I did the same to you? It's not funny, is it? Do you see what I mean? Our Lady. Where did you learn to shoot like that? -Working as a gunsmith. -You are kidding with me. Do not be silly. How would a good gunsmith be if he didn't shoot well? Or if you didn't know how to fix a gun? I've never seen an honest man who could shoot that well. But, Texas, you shot really well. Who do you work for? Kiki Kelly? -I don't even know the gentleman. -Is a woman. -The lady, then. -She's also no lady. But join me and I'll pay twice as much. I have my own business. That's the truth. I could use a man like you. I'm sorry. My great grandmother built muskets for General Washington. My grandfather built it for Andy Jackson. My father built it for General Grant. I was born to be a gunsmith, Texas. Can you play the guitar too? I heard a good one today. Old Dan Tucker. Do you know the music? Ah, I think I'm softening. Good... I'm happy to see you. Stay away from me. Hear? But, Miss. Liza, it's okay. I will not hurt you. Do you remember me. You bet I remember. No, put that gun down. Hey, put that gun down. Someone might end up... -Injured! - Let go of my horses. But, Miss. Liza, I lost my horse, my cart, I'm thirsty, my feet are hurting. You can't deny helping me. I can deny you everything. It's a trick. I'm warning you. -Look here... -Careful! What did I do? You made a fool of yourself. That's what you did. You crazy girl. I'm crazy? You didn't find me walking barefoot in the desert. I have horses, water cart and everything. I wanted you to have a sense of not trying to cross the desert alone. I thought I could make it to Arsenic City in one day with fast horses. I had no one I could trust. Oh, sure. Your grandmother told you not to trust anyone. Particularly in a man. Well, you will trust me, whether you like it or not. Let's go up. We have a long journey ahead. I better drive. I was already driving on the farm when I wasn't even born. -Before you see a horse. -Okay, you drive. Here's a good one. Don't just stand there, do something. Hello guys. I, you, she, are all brothers and sisters. -Don't be scared, lady. -I'm not. I wish I wasn't. -Who are they? - They're Piutes. The Chief is called Lobo Corredor. -What do you think they will do? - They're talking about it. Are they going to kill us? Wait a minute. Don't speak for a moment. Let me think. There is something I need to remember. Wild Indians are very superstitious. He will avoid a whirlwind in the desert because he thinks it contains a mysterious spirit, whose path must not cross, under penalty of death. -Do you have a clip? -I think so. If not, we are finished. -I have. -Right. Take the powder off those bullets. Don't miss anything. -How do I get... -Use a hairpin. Is that silk? Pure silk? Give it to me. Use mine. -What do I do now? -Put it in my pocket. Here they come. Stay behind me. Don't change your expression, no matter what. Do not show fear. Listen, Running Wolf. I am a blood brother of the wind. A great healer. I look to the east, I raise the sun, I burn a trail across the sky. I come from the four corners of the sky above us. And the 4 winds follow me, like hungry dogs. With just one wish, the fire leaps. I just want to. Which of you commands the spirit of those who sleep? You, come. Shoot that white cloth of the sleeper. Shoot. Listen carefully, Lobo Corredor. The three of us talked. The wind, the flame and me. Should I melt that moon and darken your dreams? Should I call the dead and kill you? I have said. You are a great healer. And the pale-faced woman? She is my wife. Act like you're normal. It worked? How did you know everything you said to the Indians? You pretended correctly. Haiawatha Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. What was that all about? Why didn't that man make a hole in my scarf? Any gunsmith knows that there is no way to get through silk. The bullet pushes the silk. Did that man say anything about me? He asked if it was my squaw. -And you said... -Yes. You are brave. I had to say this to protect her. Squaw means wife here. -Wife? -Yes. You would be a beautiful wife. Stay away from me. Do not touch me. MS. Liza. Don't worry about me, worry about your scalp. Good night. You have been kind to me and my people. You will be blood from my blood. My brother's brother. You will be called the Great Wind. Oh, Running Wolf. You are not serious. Hey, that's kind of you. Thanks, guys. My wife and I have been happy here with our brothers. But the time has come. We need to travel to the pale-faced city. -My heart is heavy. We will meet again. Don't forget your red brother. It will be difficult to do that, Runner Wolf. You know, Miss. Liza, when they let you live long enough to meet them, they are the nicest people I have met in Nevada. It's like I read in a book. The only difference... Oh, shut up. There it is, my cart. I will have to say goodbye. Coming from you, it looks wonderful. Oh, I didn't mean that. It's just for now. You will stay at the hotel, so I will see you again. -That's what you think. - What you mean? -I don't want to see you. -Oh, Miss Liza. You're not nervous about what happened to the Indians, are you? I couldn't help it. Hey, you took it in stride. To say the truth, I started to like you a lot? Me, my food, what did I wash or what did I sew? Oh, I had to make you do that. I had to protect her. You also had to protect your socks. Wait a minute. I just said... I heard what you said. You said goodbye. It's all right. Bye. But... -When can I see you again? -When Death Valley freezes. Let's go. Hey, that cart is mine. I don't know how he got it, but... -Are you Boone? -Yes, I'm Boone> A man left her here a few days ago. Horse and everything. I didn't see him, but he... I left you that note. I'm sorry for hitting you and taking your cart, Dan, but I had to do that. If you need a job look for me... what do you think of that? Calamitous news? Not exactly, but... When a man accepts your hospitality after saving you, then ambush you steal your horse and cart, hits your head leaves you to die in the desert, the offer of a job is not exactly an apology. Wouldn't you say? I wouldn't say. What kind of business does this Texas guy Jack Barton have? WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE $ 5,000 REWARD IN GOLD TEXAS JACK BARTON FOR ASSAULT CATTLE AND MURDER -Where do I find the sheriff? -In Boothill. -Where is it? - This is the cemetery. We are without sheriff. The last one lasted only an hour. It is not a permanent job. Are you saying there is no law enforcement officer in Arsenic City? There is no official. To tell the truth, there is also no law. HOTCHKISS LAWYER The post office is terrible. Terrible. Why, of course I would have found you. Harry Crockett's daughter. He spoke of you as if you were a little girl. I was, the last time he saw me. And you never saw him again? Dad said he wouldn't come back until he found gold. I was your father's best friend. He was a great man. Great. But a little suspicious. Perhaps not enough. Even so, if he had registered the mine, you would be a rich young woman today. I would be poor. Every thief in the territory would attack the mine. I'm a rich young woman at the moment. Did he send you a map? Did your father send you a map? Maybe I did. So you came to the right place. He just trusted me. First, we’ll register the mine, then leave the map in the vault, - Then we'll get the men together... - There'll be time for that, Mr. Hotchkiss. At the moment, I need to find a room. The hotel is full. Maybe you can help me. A bedroom? Yes of course. I know the place. A great friend of mine. A lady. She will take care of you. Let's go. How are you, Kiki? Hello, Kiki. Kiki. -There goes the boss. -Who? -Kiki Kelly. -If you do not mind, I'll keep my eye on you and the money. If I'm not mistaken, you get paid to play the piano, don't you? Sit here, Miss Crockett. I'll be right back. I'm tired of excuses. -I'm tired of financing mistakes. - Take it easy, Kiki. I spent the time and money to send him east. Would it be easy for a conqueror like you not? A man would think he doesn't trust me. He would be right. It is the second time that spoils everything. I don't want an apology, I want the Crockett mine. -Kiki, she arrived. -Who? Miss. Crockett, she's out there. She found no place to stay, -so I thought you... -How did you manage to think of something? I didn't see you bring the map. After all, it was my letter that brought you here, wasn't it? -Does she have the map? -Must be. Go get it, Pecos. My way? Do not. The last time you did it your way, you killed old Crockett. This time, we'll do it my way. Don't hurt her. If she doesn't have the map, we'll have her tell us where she is. Smoky and Riachi are in the back. I think I'll send them to look after her. Aren't they Texas Jack men? For a dollar, they work for anyone. If there are any problems... Why not let Texas Jack have all the glory? Why not? Roll it up for a while, then say there is no spare room. The hotel is full. I was told I could get a room here. I'm sorry, Mr. Hotchkiss. I couldn't stay in a place like this. There is no room, anyway. But go to the hotel, tell me i sent you and i'm sure they'll take care of you. Thanks. Miss Liza? Hey, newbie? Oh, it's you. -I'm happy to see you, newbie. -I can not say the same. If you want on your back, try to leave. -What you mean? -A bullet... With your name on it. -You do not know my name. -The bullet knows. "Paws" at the top. Are you talking about a duel? That's a fancy name for that. But I am unarmed. When you're going to kill a man, why worry about details? -I don't want to get involved in this. -Isn't that a shame? What was this? My name is Harris from the Arsenic City newspaper. Do you have a statement for the press? So that's the newbie you asked to cash out, huh? Yes. If I were you, I would change my plan. Yours is no longer healthy. I want a room, whether it's full or not. Yes sir. In fact, two have just wandered. This way, sir. -I won't forget you, Briggs. -If I forget, I'll remember you. MS. Liza. Miss Liza. "Golden Canyon." "Chimney Rock" What are you doing? Saving your neck. Do not. Not! You should have memorized it when you received it. I tried. Do you think you'd carry it if you could remember? -Now, he's gone. -Gone... Here. But I do not know you. How can I trust you? Since I'm the only one who knows and you can't remember, you will trust me. Daniel. -Be careful. -Thanks, Miss... It looks like it was a beautiful shooting. I could use a man like that. Is that all you have to say? Pecos, a novice like that can even take out the gun of a tough man like you. Nobody would take my gun. -Where did you get that? -I got it from the rookie, who took it from you. -He stole it from me. -Oh, of course. What will Texas do about it? Well, Pecos, if he shoots as well as you said, I will do 3 things. First, I won't let him be angry with me. Second, I will try to get you to join me. And third, if you like, I'll join him. He killed two of his best men. They were two of your best men, weren't they? Where are you going? I didn't trust Smoky and Riachi, any more than I trust you. -What are you implying? -Do you know. -Don't abuse Texas. -I'm abusing. -I won't run away. -Okay we're done. You should get married, Pecos. So your wife could run your family, instead of Kiki Kelly. I will see you again. Well, of course. And if something happens to Daniel, it will be sooner than you think. OPEN FOR BUSINESS - Can you fix it, Mr. Boone? -The dog is crooked. - It will cost you $ 5. dollars. -Good price. My name is Smith. -Smith? This is not a name, it is a number. Someone bent the trigger on my gun yesterday. -I want to know if you can fix it. -Sam. -Hi Daniel. -Hi. -What are you doing out here? -I had to use my cart as a store. I couldn't find a place to rent. Hey, I'm happy to see you. I was trying to find you. For what? Well, I was just trying to thank you for saving my neck yesterday. -Oh, it was nothing. -Can I buy you dinner? -You just went bankrupt. - I'll be back in an hour, guys. Thanks. -Sam, what if I had a gold mine? -Everyone has. Yes, but what if that one had gold in it? -What difference does? -What would I have to do? -Work on it. -Like? Dig, grind, wash and melt. But it takes a lot of fire. 2,700 degrees celsius. That's what it says in the encyclopedia. That's what I said. Enough fire. -What if I had such a mine? -But do not have. Elizabeth Crockett has. -Who? -Harry Crockett's daughter. -That girl? -Yes, she's here. She has. A rich mine. She needs help, Sam. Both of us. Dan, I always felt bad for not paying Harry Crockett for the help he gave me. I am grateful for the chance to help. -We'll leave for the mine tonight. -Right Do you still not trust me? I do not have a choice. This is what gold does. Why don't you forget that? Gold seems to make others act against the teachings of God. I would say that this gold made things unhappy. Yes, Daniel, it has been an unfortunate gold. But I think that maybe I can find happiness with him. - Happiness didn't bring you much. -Maybe bring it to the others. -For your grandmother? -For my grandchildren. So, get rid of the newbie. Texas said it wouldn't like that. Get rid of Texas first. If you think I'll serve against Texas, you're crazy, Kiki. This can be done. Barney, bring me paper and pencils. Sit down. Hello, Porgy. Where have you been? Down there. I have a letter for you. -Who gave you? -The Beginner. Dear Texas. I am disabled and I ask for your immediate help. I'll be waiting for you at the hotel. Come in a hurry, but come alone. "Daniel". Who is "rushed"? How will I go alone if I have to go with this? It's a word, it means in a hurry. Oh, it looks like Dan, doesn't it? Uses many fancy words. He loves to read, you know? Spiggoty, saddle my horse. - It could be a Texas trap. -Maybe it isn't. That makes life interesting. But it has to be Dan. He's the only one in Arsenic City who writes well. Rushed. Are you sure it's a word? Sure. Hands up, Texas. -So it was a trap? -And you put your neck in it. - Did the newbie write the letter? -Not. You don't write that well, Pecos. You forgot, Texas. Kiki had a good education. I have been waiting for this for a long time. It is very good to spoil with a bullet. Let's go. Hey, they got Texas Jack. They will hang you. Attention guys. Pecos Kid caught Texas Jack Barton. We will have a hanging! Dan. Dan! Pecos and his men took Texas Jack. Great. It was time to arrest him. They will not arrest you, they will hang you. -Will they hang up? -He will be lynched. They cannot link it. -We have to stop them. -You can't stop anything. The whole city is supporting it. I don't care if the whole state is supporting it. Two mistakes do not make a right. Stop everything! -You can't do that. -Who said? - Stay out of this, newbie. -Or we will hang you too. You have to give this man a fair trial. If you're found guilty, hang him. -But they can't linch it. -Who said we can't? We are the law, we are the people. The people are the law. We will hang him. And if you try to stop us, we'll hang you too. Yes, the people make the law, but not like that. There has been a law since that country was born, but it was not done that way. The people did it, the citizens. You are great citizens. Let's go. Hang them both. We don't want words, we want action! I'm talking about action. The kind of action your parents saw at Gettysburg. That your grandparents saw in New Orleans and your great grandparents saw in Yorktown. Do you know what they fought for? Have you heard of the Bill of Rights? She says... No person will be arrested to answer for a capital crime, or deprived of his life, freedom or property, without due legal process. This is the 5th Amendment to the US Constitution. -The rookie is right. -Let's arrest Texas. -We'll hang you legally later. -Wait a minute! Look who's preaching about law and order. Now, this rookie is nothing more than a mine thief. And I can prove it! Now, he's in league with Texas Jack. -Texas is the newbie's partner. -That's a lie. He stole Miss Crockett's map. He and Texas Jack were going to steal Crockett's mine. You know what kind of gunman he is. Do you think an honest man would shoot like him? You are lying. Everyone is lying! Let's get him! Get out of here. Don't shoot. They killed Sam. They killed him. Golden Canyon is ahead, enter it. It's wild land to Chimney Rock. Chimney Rock. See you, Daniel. But you must remember something. You must have looked at that map 1,000 times. Do you think I would carry it if I remembered? I just know that I'm tired of asking questions lady. So, Daniel Boone memorized the map and burned it, huh? Yes. He's a stranger here, a newbie. Where do you think he went? He probably went to find the Piutes on the hills. The Piutes? Now the skinning will live. I don't believe her. Understand, ma'am. We're just trying to help. That rookie tricked you. He is not with the Indians. Now, he and Texas Jack must be stealing his gold right now. You are lying. It's all right. I'm lying. But you better start remembering that map quickly, lady. I am not a patient man. What are you facing? How does it feel to kill a man? It was nothing. Killing is easy. It is better to look at this paper and start drawing. I've been keeping Pecos away from you. But tomorrow, you will be at his mercy. Why is Grande Vento frowning? Your heart is heavy. Piutes! -Beetle. -Yes, Pecos? Follow them carefully and mark the spot. I will gather the men and follow him. -But they're Piutes. -Did you hear me. Go! Okay, Pecos. Oh, Daniel. I am so happy to see you safe and well. I'm sorry for scaring you. There was no other way to get her here. On here? What horrible place is this? That awful place is the Crockett mine. It was your father's, now it's yours. I demarcated your mine. You can register it in Arsenic City. Lobo Corredor promised not to let his mine be stolen, -until law and order appear. What you mean? Look. -They are cannon balls. -Don't let that ink fool you. This is solid gold. We did this so that they could not steal. Daniel, you are wonderful. I had a lot of problems enriching you, Miss. Liza. And to prove that the lies you believed were not true. I didn't believe them. Now, I offer you your mine, your gold and safe transportation back. -Can you hear me? -After that, -I hope not to see you again. -What? I didn't want it to end like this. I was in love with you. I was stuck with the idea of ​​asking you in... Marriage? I can't believe I wanted that. How could you think that I would betray you? -I never thought... -On the night of the lynching. -Pecos said that, not me. -The way you looked at me. I thought they were going to kill you. I was afraid. -Fear of losing my memory. - To lose you. -I do not believe in you. -Daniel. Come on, we have to get out of here. We have a long journey ahead. -Listen to me, Daniel Boone. -Bone. I'm tired of this madness. I died of worry for you, because I love you. Hear? And you know you love me. I'll be happy to admit that when Death Valley freezes. Take a look. It's your friend Daniel Boone and a girl. -She is beautiful. -What else do you see on the cart? -Cannon balls. -Yes, cannon balls. We'd better check. Are they. Beetle keep the men hidden. If you hear a shot, come running. Come on, Pecos. Pull over, newbie. I'll be straightforward, lady. Speak or he dies. I will tell you. Do not shot. -I'll tell you. - Be silent. I will not do that. He will kill you, Daniel. I'll tell you where the mine is. Drop it, Pecos. Drop it! This is none of your business, Texas. -Lady, if you weren't a woman... -I never asked to treat myself differently. Maybe I will hear you. Hello lady. -Hello, Dan. -How are you, Texas? I'm warning you, Texas. Stay out of it. This is our business. You two, worms, are my business. The last time I saw him, his rope was around my neck. And as I recall, Pecos, you controlled it. -Thanks for coming to help us, Texas. -Well, I didn't exactly do that. But I am a curious man. And you are smart. So I wondered. Why would Daniel Boone carry a load of cannon balls? Are there cannons around here? Is the army around here? So, cannon balls would be the least valuable things you could carry. Unless they're made of... Caution! Did you get it, Daniel? I still don't understand how an honest man can shoot like that. Got something right? Swinging and with a revolver at that distance? They are getting closer. The Indians are coming. Indians! The Indians are coming. The Indians are coming. The red skins are coming. The Indians are coming. Now, it's Daniel Boone. Well, Miss. Liza, let's just go over here. -How can I thank you Dan? -You do not have to thank me. I will always remember you with deep respect. Will you remember me? Where are you going? - West. - You're in the west. - Into the west. -I mean... - Who will divorce me? Divorce me... But we... We are not married. Of course we are. -Who? -We? Aren't we, Chief? Great Wind, you said on the board that she was your squaw. You lived in a tent, with a blanket. You husband, she wife. -Oh, Miss. Liza. -MS. Liza. - Did you know that all the time? -Of course I did. It is an ancient indigenous law. I love to read, you know? Mr. Boone. Mr. Boone. It's not Boone, it's Bone. I've told you several times... Do you have a statement for the press? I have a statement about the weather. You can say it has snowed in Death Valley. And so it was, children, that your grandmother won over your grandfather. -Wow, grandpa. And is this the end? Oh, no, children. That was just the beginning.
