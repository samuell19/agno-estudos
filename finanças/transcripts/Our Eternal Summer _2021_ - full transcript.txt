I've always loved summer. And when we were eighteen we both said it'd be the best summer ever. We'd have finished high school, we'd be free, we vowed to do so many things. I knew that you'd be leaving, that you wanted to go away to uni, while I'd be staying here. But I thought we'd always get back together. Our Eternal Summer Lise. Wake up. Lise. What time is it? Eleven. That's okay. Come on, wake up. Wake up! You're a pain! I don't like mornings. You're so beautiful when you sulk. - So you're not getting up? - No. I hate you! No, not the hose! Come back. Don't you want to play? Not so cocky now, are you? It feels good, actually. Lola. Lola, give it here. - I think this'll be good. - Yeah, defo. - No, no! - Yes! That's disgusting. You shouldn't mix two sorts of alcohol together. - You'll end up in an alcoholic coma. - That's Lise-level stupidity! Cheers! - All right! - Take it easy. Who wants one? I thought you'd always protect me. Because you were the stronger of the two of us. And throw your hair around. There you are! Lola! Hot stuff! - Go for it! - Yeah! Nice one! Did you screw? No. No, we didn't. Why? I dunno, it would have been too trite to sleep together. The usual thing: you meet a guy and you sleep with him. - You didn't have any condoms. - Yes, we did! Yes. - Couldn't he get it up, then? - Yes, he could. But, I dunno, it wasn't necessary. It would have been an overdose. It was as if... From the point when it was just the two of us, it was like we were already making love, mentally. I'm tired. Are you going to see him again? No. Why? If I see him again it'll lose that "first night" specialness. I want it to stay exactly the way it happened. What'll happen if we meet? We'll have a coffee... and I'll realise he's just a guy and I'm just a woman. Whereas last night I really felt that we were... divine. - We were gods. - Lola! - It's true! - Gods, really? Yeah. Gods. You're a total weirdo. Come on, come on! No, no! He's trying to kill me! Watch out! Stop that for fuck's sake! Stop it! Élias! Let's arm wrestle! Be the table. I'm the table. One, two, three. You're crap. - Can you put some cream on me? - Yeah. No, Malo! It's okay, I'm just trying it on. You'll get it wet. - Yes, but it suits me better. - Stop it! Shit! Give it back! Now give it back. That's enough. - She's in love. - Yeah. Yeah, you think so? Look at her face. Look, look! Her dimples and everything. All right, leave me alone! You did look intense when you got off with him. - Well, I liked him. - We could see that. And you, are you still a romantic? No, I'm not a romantic, it's just that... I just think Tinder is shit. Also, love makes you stupid. Am I stupid? No, you're not! - I didn't mean that. - Malo! Do you feel stupid? Sometimes. Why? He's in love. The trick question! My turn? No, I just put five down. I put two down. I'm ruined! Aren't you fed up, always shagging the same person? And you, always with different guys? No, it's always something new. Do you experiment, do different things? Well, look... No one asked you! No, it's all fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not worrying. We... We've never talked about that evening. You didn't want to. Neither did I. But it was with her. - There, relax. - Stop it! - You're really sun burnt. - Am I? Do you want some too? No, no, it'll hurt. Stop it! I've got some in my hair too. Your skin's so soft. Blow hard so it dries. That never works. That was so soothing. Oh, yeah! Let's go. Cheers! Make eye contact! Don't cross arms! You nearly ate my finger! She spat it all out and he took a huge mouthful. Spat out a whole pizzeria. You're horrible! I want some of that. Smile now. Smile. Smile. Smile, Malo. Melon's dangerous. Don't you want any? - Are you done with the spliff? - Done, done... I'm well done! "I'm well done"! You thought I was going to. No, calm down, calm down! Go on, go on! I did it with Lola. Do it. Come here, baby. Be gentle, it's my first time! I've got a stiffy now! That explains all the times you've looked at me funny. - Shall we go? - Yeah, it's getting cold. What, now? Let's have another swim. Lise? No. - Élias, coming? - No, I'm too pissed. One last dip. Lola, come for a dip. Just a quick one. Come on! I think I wanted to kiss her. I think she wanted to also. I even had time to think it was a... perfect moment. And I'd barely had time to think that, before... it turned into the worst moment of my life. Lola? Lola! We all started shouting, we all started... looking for her. Then Sam and Soa called the emergency services. After that it was horrible. I thought we were immortal. Maybe I died too. Maybe that's why I feel nothing. If I see a girl who looks a bit like you, my heart starts beating wildly. And I feel hope that everyone was wrong, that you never drowned, that you're still alive. You got a smoke? Doesn't your boyfriend have one? You got a problem? You act like nothing's wrong but you know very well! - She doesn't mean it. - No, let her explain. - Where's your boyfriend? - Stop it, Soa. - After what he did! - What did he do? Are you that fucking stupid? He's at home, suffering too! Stop talking shit! - You think it was his fault? - Yes, it was all his fault! Can you hear yourself? Leave me alone! Leave me alone, you maniac! Yeah, fuck off! You never listen, anyway! It's all right. She's just lashing out. All right? - Where have you been? - At home. Been in the sea? Who's that? Élias, about tonight. I'm not going. I'll go. I need to get out, see people, have a laugh, have a drink... I need to live. Why won't you go? Lise. Are you fucking stupid? I've fallen out with everyone. Do you blame me? Lise, what is it? Don't you want me any more? I can't be with them when I'm with you? She thinks it's my fault. That's just her. - Everyone thinks I killed her. - Stop it. You'd have saved her if you could. What do you think? It was an accident. Could have been you, bruv. Are you okay? I don't understand how that can happen. I don't understand how you can go for a swim and not come back. When you're young, you think that... you're invincible, immortal, and that... it'll last for ever. I thought it'd last for ever, I wanted it to last for ever. It was you who introduced me to the gang, it was you who got me partying, it was you who... helped me discover everything I'd seen in films that... I'd dreamt of experiencing. And then... Now I don't know what to do, I don't know if it'll be the same thing without you, if the gang... still has any point. I don't know if maybe I'll end up alone. If I'll still go to Spain to celebrate my 18th. What are you doing? Come on, forget that. Thanks. Lise! Have we met before, Lise? - No, I don't think so. - No? That's me being paranoid, then. When I saw you earlier, I thought we knew each other, but no. How did you meet? On the beach. I'm... her twilight encounter! Want a drop, Lise? I'll have some. I'll pour you a glass. That's disgusting. With your mouth like a tramp! Is that okay, Lise? Thanks. What was that about a twilight encounter? An exercise we did with Rita. We had to talk about significant encounters that we'd made at dawn or twilight. So, if you follow Marlon's thinking, he's your twilight encounter. Your significant encounter. - Hi, Lise. - Hi. Come and sit down. I'll give you a plate. There. Thanks. Coffee? Yes, please. I'll have some too. Thanks. Did you sleep well up there? Yes. I'm gonna see about the sound system. I'll be back about 2. What are you gonna do? Don't listen to her. She'll drag you into it and you'll be sat waiting till 4 in the afternoon. Forget it. I'm not coming. - And coffee's a killer. - I like killing myself with coffee. I'm gonna hang around here a bit. Then, if I can get the overhead projector, I can test the equipment. Sorry, but is it a lifestyle choice to always talk with your mouth full? - Sorry, I don't do it on purpose. - Horrible noise! What are you doing today, Lise? No idea. I don't have anything in particular to do. Are you at school? I've just finished my exams, so school is all over. Are you a runaway? No. It's just that... I don't feel like going home. It's not because of my parents. I dunno, it's just that my head's full of shit at the moment. You can stay here a bit, until you feel better. We have stuff to do, but you can just chill. Yeah, make yourself at home. "Suddenly into one's thoughts. "I am he who knows the inner recesses of loss. "I lose myself... "I lose myself in my thoughts, as in a dream," "as one enters suddenly into..." "One's thoughts." "I am he who holds the inner recesses of my loss." What are you doing? Learning something Rita told me to learn. Anton in Artaud, do you know it? She picked out the bits in fluorescent yellow. "Deep in the cry of revolutions and storms," "deep in the crush of my brain..." Do you have to read that? It's depressing. You think she forces me to? No. I like doing it. The problem is, I don't always understand it. Sometimes I finish saying a phrase, but I didn't understand it. And you? Me? You're not reading or anything? Do you like doing nothing? I'm not in the mood right now. - Not in the mood for anything! - Yeah, that's it. I just want to be quiet. You should call your mum, though. They must be worried about you. I'm sure they are, they couldn't not be. I'll send them a text. Why don't you call them? It's better. Imagine... I'm just saying, as an example. One day you decide to send them a text. So you send a text, and two days later they still haven't replied. You think maybe they haven't seen it, so you call, once, twice, ten times. And in the end... you find out that they're dead. I know all of that. I know it already. No, I don't think you do. Enjoy it before it's too late. Everyone leaves this world. Only the walls remain. Today... you may not be able to see it, but... I'm better. One day an old man in the street told me that maybe I'll see you again in heaven... and... we'll be able to talk again... like before. I wish that... you were still here to shout at me. I miss you so much. You made me strong, you know? Nothing can frighten me any more, since you went. You can press it with your fingers. Mr Legislator of the 1916 bill, passed as the July 1917 Drug Act, you are an arsehole. Your law just annoys world pharmaceutics without reducing the nation's drug addiction. (Because: 1) The number of addicts who obtain supplies from pharmacies is tiny. (2) Real drug addicts don't get their supplies from pharmacies. (3) Addicts who get their supplies from pharmacies are all sick. (4) The number of sick addicts is tiny compared to the number of fun-seekers. (5) Pharmaceutical restrictions on drugs will never bother organised fun-seeking addicts. (6) There will always be pushers. (7) There will always be drug addicts through rebellion and desire. (8) Sick addicts have an inalienable right over society to be left alone. There is one illness against which opium is sovereign, and that is anxiety, in its mental, medical, physiological, logical or pharmaceutical form. Anxiety which makes lunatics. Anxiety which beats against walls. Anxiety which scratches mercilessly from inside. Anxiety which makes suicides. Anxiety which damns people. Anxiety which medicine and your doctor don't recognise. Anxiety which wrongs life. Anxiety which pinches the umbilical cord of life. No, not like that. Hang on... Go on, Marlon, your toast. I drink to... Lise. To be fair, that's lovely. Yeah, classy. You hoping for a shag? Seriously, Cosmo? I dunno! Lise, do you have a toast? I drink to you lot, for your welcome. Cheers. If you had to be some entity, what would it be? Marlon? I dunno. What I'd like to be is Jesus. Everyone loves a god. I'm like this, everyone loves me, I perform miracles, I walk on water. You try to touch me but, no, you can't. Because I'm a mirage. I could wear a harness, so I can fly up in the air... I don't think Jesus is the best representation for this show. Nice try, but no. Marlon, what do you want you be? Time. - Time? - Yeah. What would you do? Fix stuff. Fix what? Marlon, what would you do? What would you do? Time is a good idea. I dunno, I'd be there, around you lot, I'd move forward, go back, and at some points I could freeze time. That suits him. Yeah. It'll do him good, anyway, a bit of peace and calm. I want to be a wave. - A wave dies as soon as it's born. - Fine by me. What about you, Lise? I dunno. I like the idea of time, but... I wouldn't want to be a wave. - Shall we move a bit? - Yeah. Okay. "What's inside me" plus movement. What's inside me... What's inside me... What's inside me... What's inside me... What's inside me... What's inside me... Come on! Okay, what's inside me... What's inside me... Your turn, Marlon. What's inside me... This is a fucking pain, I'm not in the mood. - What do you mean? - It's a waste of time. We're doing these things that won't even be in the play. It's a waste of time. It's not a waste of time. - It's moronic! - It's not moronic! We're putting on a play, not... Yeah, but we have to work through lots of things to get there. It needs time, hard work, you have to be patient... I don't want to do these experiments... - What do you want to do? - Do the play! You want to earn a million, go straight to Hollywood? It doesn't work like that! Get out of my space! Come up with something, then. You don't like what we're doing, so suggest something else. - I've got nothing. - He's got nothing! Go on! Maybe try to do something calmer. There's nothing calmer, don't you get it? It's not her fault. It's because she's here that he won't do it! I'm going out! You two can't communicate, it does my fucking head in! What do we do now? Marlon? I dunno. Are you still pissed off? No, I've calmed down. Can't you sit down rather than pacing like that? Want some? Don't you sometimes feel we'll die before we've done 1% of what we were meant to do? No. You never think about that? I think about it all the time, Rita, you know that. Why do you think we fell out just then? Why did we argue? You know I don't like wasting time. Rather than working on the play, and you know I love your play, I'd really like to do that, we're just monkeying about, jumping up and down, shouting... I don't get it, I don't like wasting time. Why do you say that, now she's here? We could have discussed it before, just amongst us. Stop it. Lola. Yes? Do you think this void will one day be filled? Thanks. Let's go. Where? Just leave. You, me, nick a car and leave. And Lise? Lise has already gone. Don't say things like that, please. I just want to get away from here. Everyone does. - You'll leave me here alone? - No. After all we've been through together. You've always been there for me, even when I didn't need you. And you'll just go away, leaving all this behind you? I'll come back. I don't want you to go. Why? I need you. I dunno. Look... I've got so used to you, to everything we've done together, to all the everyday stuff. I think I love you, actually. What? You just come out with that, I don't know what to say. You could say something like: "Me too." For example. Yeah, it wouldn't be a lie. I'll leave you alone. When I... finished high school, I left for a year. I just couldn't be with my mates, with the people around me. I couldn't... I couldn't talk. I'd gone sort of mute. So I left. One of my mates told me about this lake, about an hour and a half from Toulouse, in the middle of the mountains. I thought: "I'll try the hermit life, since I can't be with people." Seriously? I was doing, like, Into the Wild. I ended up, at 8:30 in the evening, in this town called Mazamet. I was hitch-hiking with my big yellow rucksack. And finally I got picked up by this really nice young guy. Rémi, his name was. I said: "I'm going to this place, La Planète." He said: "What's that, a nightclub?" We couldn't find it, he didn't know where it was. And he put me up for 3 or 4 days. He lived with his mum and sister in this dump of a place. They were really poor. He had... He couldn't sleep at night because a year before that he'd killed someone with his car. Someone the same age as him. So, since then... Yeah. I'd love to see that guy again. Sometimes you meet people like that... And after that I made it to the famous lake. - Weren't you afraid, alone at night? - Yes, I was. What did you do? I had books, I read a lot. But, yes, I was afraid. The first night there was a storm, then there are the noises of nature, of animals... You don't feel so cocky out there. - But you made it through. - Yeah, I did. It calmed me down, soothed me. Then I did lots of stuff. I lived in Lyon, mostly on the street. Then I met this guy, who I fell madly in love with. He left... He left for the skiing season two weeks after we got together. I got his number, I called him and I said: "I'm coming to you." And I did. Why couldn't you be with other people? Are you missing someone? Yeah. I'm missing someone, yeah. Then I came back, and started doing theatre. I want to say two things. To tell you two things. The first thing is that I'm angry with you. Terribly so. I think it was selfish. Leaving us all alone here, in the shit. It's easy to do that. Too easy. Because we're still here, getting up in the morning. We have to keep on breathing... to keep on fighting. And the second thing is that... I thought you were brave to do that. Lola. I didn't want you to go. I didn't want to either, Lise. But I'll always be here. I promised you and I'm promising now. I know. I can feel it. When you left I thought my life stopped there. But it's not true. I want to live. I'll live for both of us. It'll always be Lise and Lola, Lola and Lise. Always.
