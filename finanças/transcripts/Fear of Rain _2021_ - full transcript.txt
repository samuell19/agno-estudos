Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! He's coming. Hold on. - He's coming! - Let me go! No! Stop! You're making it worse! Stop! - Don't tie her down! Stop! - Go ahead. The medicine makes her a zombie. Of course she's going to try to wean herself off of it. It doesn't make any sense. Here's your checklist, Rain. It's been years, and that's the best you can do? - Yes. - You're a doctor. Jumping to anger isn't helping. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's just... She said she was feeling better. We see that regularly with schizophrenia. Patients take their medicine, feel better, and then think they can go off it. But it can't be cured. She's gonna be an adult. And then what? We're supposed to lock her in a room - for the rest of her life? - John. What? Is there... another way? What? Short of admitting her into a psychiatric facility... - No! - Absolutely not! Her psychiatrist can try switching her over to an atypical antipsychotic, which may have fewer side effects. Hey, baby. Is this happening? John, she's awake. Hey, baby. - Hanging in there? - Yeah. Okay. Again, for maintenance staff, please call extension 405. Again, for maintenance staff, please call extension 405. Can I get you anything? Rain? Rain? Didn't you say you wanted something to sketch with? Um, wait. Could I have a pencil? - We can't give... - Just a soft sketch pencil. I'll get you some crayons. Dr. Lin, you got 447, Dr. Lin, 447. I don't know what to say. Whatever comes to mind. Nothing? Too much. Well, let's start with what you remember then. Do you recall anything that triggered it? Um... I'm... I don't... I don't... I remember... going upstairs and then being on the bus. But you never left your house. I was in the woods, though. There was a man chasing me. Rain, these episodes get increasingly worse each time you try going off your meds. You just... you don't... you don't understand. I... I get that the medicine could make me, like, more stable or whatever but I... It makes me feel like a zombie. And I... I can't paint, if I can't feel anything. We can try experimenting until we find - the right com... - Experimenting? I'm not... I'm not a lab rat. Not taking it is not an option. One more misstep and the state is going to institutionalize you, Rain. It's not fair. People see and hear God. No one thinks they're nuts. That's not the same thing. Why not? Is everything okay? Yeah, monkey. Everything's fine. Jack of all trades. Yeah. Master of none. Mom, what's wrong? It's been a rough week. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no. It's just... your dad and I handle things differently. Let me know if you need anything. Looking forward to having you back in class, Rain. Grandma and grandpa? Who else? It didn't work. I'll let you tell them that. And for what it's worth, they sent me good luck balloons when I told them I wanted to open my own restaurant. Yeah, look how that ended up. Sold out. Rain? Hey, baby. It's gonna be okay. - Just... - Stop! Get off! Hey. Don't worry about all this, okay? I'll get it fixed up. Oh, it's okay, monkey. It's okay. Hey. Why don't you stay in the guest room till I'll get it all put back together. All right? This is my fault. You have not lost me, brother. You like strawberry pomegranate? Are you cool with that? Yeah. Just a normal PBJ is fine, Dad. It's normal, it's just, like, spruced up. - Dad, I'm sure it's fine. - I put my magic touch on it. Hey... - I know you're... - I've missed this. ...you're on your way out the door and stuff. - Dad. - But I want you to know that - if you need to chill... - Dad. - ...and maybe going to school... - Dad, Dad. ...you might feel a little bit... Dad, I love you and I understand that you're worried... but I'm good. You've got to let me try, okay? Okay. It's not like I'm on drugs or anything. Best jelly I ever had. It's jam, it's made from fruit pulp. Have a great day, sweetheart. - Love you. Bye. - Bye. I love you. Uh, okay. We've got a lot to cover if any of you have a hope in hell of passing your finals. Welcome back, Rain. Care to join us? Come on. So, I gotta see more quotes in your essays. I mean, you can't just say "Heathcliff is a psycho." I mean, uh... Uh, well... you can't just say, "Heathcliff is a sadistic ass because he spent his entire life pining after his childhood crush and plotting against the man she ends up marrying." And I'm not disagreeing with you. But back up your claims. Let's get textual. Okay? Got it? Do we see nodding heads? Yeah, please. Good. All right. Let's get going. Chicken and guacamole. Sorry, it's just... I have a strict diet. Medical stuff. I don't know. I was just so annoyed... Hey. I tried calling you the other day. I like your necklace. It's cool. It's a choker. Do you mind if I sit with you guys? Oh, no room. Sorry. Not for all those personalities. - That's not what... - Be careful. She might go all Carrie on us. Whoa. Yeah, you wouldn't even believe half the things I've seen. I heard she tried to kill herself. She's just desperate for attention. Hey. I'm Caleb. You wanna pick a card, any card? I know it's clich√©, but come on, do it anyway. Come on, Rain. you know what, just take... You know, it's Tarot, so it's a little more... difficult. Do you remember it? - Mm-hmm. - Throw it back in the deck. Really gotta stop talking. I don't like magic. Well, you're in luck because this isn't magic, this is skill. Tap the top of the deck. Just give it a little... See, this is the really interactive part where I just distract you, that way you're really impressed when I swap it out and you flip over your card and that's yours. What? It's not yours? No, no. I'm kidding. I know that. I just gave you that one as a gift to, you know, balance out your own, which is under your bottle. Where you from? Why haven't I seen you around? What is this, 20 questions? Five, so far actually. Um, I've been out sick. I mean, you're new. Where are you from? Uh... Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Arkansas, New Mexico. Uh, must suck, leaving your friends. Uh, I got to go do a bunch of makeup work. 'Cause I've been out. Sorry. I gotta go. All right. Well, hey, if you ever, you know, you wanna hang out sometime and grab a cup of coffee, that'd be... Oh, I can't drink coffee. Caffeine makes me... Well, me neither. So, yeah, you know, if you ever wanna hang out and grab a cup of non-coffee, that'd be... That'd be fun. Rain? Rain? I was just saying hi. Looks like you're up. Hi. I'm picking up for Rain Burroughs. B-U-R-R-O-U-G-H-S. Yeah, as much as I would love to, I don't... I don't think now's a good time to be... to be starting up something like that, so... Yeah. No, I've been wanting to get back into it. It's just work's been hectic and... I should probably be around here. Thanks, though. Thanks for thinking of me. Dad, who is that? Oh, hey. It was nothing. It was Phil. He's... catering some events this month, wanted to know if I could help out. That's all. You're not going to? No. I don't... I don't have time. I mean, no, you should go. You haven't cooked in forever. - I cook for you all the time. - Yeah, Mom and I don't count. You sure? - Really? - Yes. - I don't have to do it. - We'll be fine. Rain? Honey, your father will take the door off the hinges if you keep locking it. Yeah, I know. It's a habit. Sorry. - Did you hear anything? - Mm-mm. So, how was your first day back? It was great. Yeah, everyone thinks I'm a freak. Oh, I doubt that. Isn't it cool to be different nowadays? Not recently hospitalized for psychosis. It's like the biggest event of the year for them. It's ridiculous. I mean, everyone knows. - Even my teachers. - It'll blow over. Someone will get a bad haircut, or Alexa will make out with someone's boyfriend, and... they'll forget all about it. No, she just... won't talk to me anymore. She's got whole new friends who love hearing horror stories about the crazy girl. Stop calling yourself that. It's like I'm a social currency. Whatever. I mean, I don't care. It gives me more time to paint. I think that's what I wanna study. - In college? - Mm-hmm. You don't think I'll get in? No, I just... I didn't know that's what you wanted. I think... I think that would be wonderful for you. How long is this going to take? Well, it's me. I'm a spectacularly talented daughter, who's one to spend hours memorializing me. I can actually feel myself aging. Yeah, you're right. A lot of wrinkles. Who knows how long that'll take. Hmm. Bring your sweater. It's 90 degrees outside. I'm already roasting. - It feels good. - Yeah, for a sauna. Bye. Ready, guys? And go. Hey, I'll walk with you. No, thanks. We don't wanna catch your crazy. Hey, wait up. Hey! - What are you up to? - What are you doing? - Cutting class, I guess. - Well, stop. Why? It's just P.E. Gonna end up in the nurse's office anyway. I mean, stop following me. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. My best friend won't even talk to me anymore. - Why not? - I don't know. There's got to be some kind of reason. When I said I don't know, I mean I kind of know, I just don't wanna talk about it. Oh. You wanna get out of here? Maybe I could take you home or wherever. Wherever? Yeah. Okay. We're gonna be pedaling this thing like the Flintstones. Yeah, sorry, I'm still restoring it. How long has it been? A while. It wasn't running, so I had to rebuild the carburetor. I've got new rotors, brake pads, change the starter and then replaced the rack and pinion. It's been about six months, But, you know... I ran out of money before I got to the body. - At least it's running. - For now. Oh. So, is that what you wanna do? - What? - Be a mechanic? No. Well... car mechanics and quantum mechanics aren't closely related. They're more like homonyms. You know, like, a wave versus two wave. If that makes sense. - That's cool. - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Okay. We're gonna have to... - stop here. - What? Why? Uh... My... My windshield wipers aren't working. We're gonna be stuck here for a minute. Do you have to do that? - What? - Just magic. Right now? I already told you it's not magic. It's skill. It's puzzles, sleight of hand. Everything is contingent on the sleight of mind. Everything's an illusion. Get out while you can. Back to weather on the seven. Please, please stop. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. Well, you're fidgeting, and your face is flushed, your breathing's shortened, so... What are you afraid of? Nothing. You're just... You're just talking really fast. I guess I can have that effect on people sometimes. It's just because I don't like about inconsequential stuff like the weather. Which would be ironic actually. - Hmm? - If it was the weather. You know, like, Rain afraid of rain. Run now. Rain, run! No. I just... I just... I just wanna go home. - Right here? - Yeah. It's okay. Oh, you didn't have to get my door. I did. The passenger door doesn't open from the inside, so it's... - Sorry for wasting your day. - Oh, you didn't waste it. You don't have to protect my feelings either. This was actually the... One of the best days I've had in a really long time. We didn't do anything. Yeah. - Have a nice night. - You too. Look, there's something I need to tell you, I don't want you to get freaked out or anything. I'm, like, sick. No, I mean, not like cancer. Like... in my head. Hey, Rain? Oh, hey. Okay. This thing's gonna go really late, and I got my guys working, so they're gonna handle the cleanup. I'll be home as early as I can, I promise. And I have my phone. Okay. Where's your phone? Do you have it? Yes, I have my phone. All right. I literally just told you not to lock the door. Rain, I'm not gonna tell you again. - Where were you? - I... I was at the library. I was... studying and... Mm-hmm. - What's his name? - Who? You forget your father and I were study buddies. That's gross. His name is Caleb. It's a nice name. I got to call your grandparents. You should help your father finish loading up. Help! It's not real, it's not real. - It's not real, it's not real. - Rain? Hey. - Did you hear that? - What? There was a girl... A girl next door, a tiny little girl. - Wh... Where? - She was... She was screaming for help. Did you hear? Um, no. I... I didn't hear anything. Where did you see her? In the... Over there in the window. - Rain, there's nobody out here. - No, she was there. I swear. She was standing there and then she... She grabbed her. - Who? - Ms. McConnell? No. I don't know! I couldn't see. Oh. Rain, use your checklist. Is it possible? No. She doesn't even have kids. Yeah, I know, but that... That's the point, Dad. Oh, this is ridiculous. - Honey. - All right. Why don't you try to go to bed and then, we'll go over there tomorrow and... we'll check it out, okay? - On or off? - On is good. - Mom? - Yeah, baby? - Can you stay with me? - Of course, baby girl. - You having second thoughts? - No. - Are you sure? - Dad. Oh! - Good morning. - Good morning. I wasn't expecting guests. Yeah. Can we... Can we just talk to you for a sec? Yeah, sure. Come on in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry about the mess. I'm still fixing her up. You should see my place. I've seen your yard. So, what can I do for you? Okay, this might sound a little bit weird, but um, Rain has been hearing these noises, and we just thought that we would come by to make sure everything was... Everything is good. - What kind of noises? - A little girl. Little girl? Uh, the folks across the street have kids. That's probably what you heard. - She's lying! - Rain. There's a little girl in your attic! I saw her. In my attic? I have an attic, but there's no one up there as far as I know. I'm happy to bring you up there. No, no, no, that's... We're good. - Thank you for the offer. - Yeah. I want to. Oh! Okay. Well, this does not make me look good. - Quite a collection. - Yeah. I have not been up here since Gram passed. She made each one by hand. Their clothes were much nicer than anything she ever made us. Yeah, it sure does bring back memories. Oh! Oh, jeez. Don't... I definitely don't even worry about it. Jeez. - Hey. - Yeah? We'll get out of your hair. You good, Rain? Thank you for humoring her. That's not a problem. Humor me, Dad? What? Do you think this is a joke? No, I don't. She's lying! Did you see the Almanacs? - There's one up there from 2018! - So what, Rain? She said she hasn't been up there. Who gives a shit whether she's been in her own attic or not? Well, you never believe me! You listen to someone you don't even like. Hold up. I get it! I get it! She's wacko, okay? But she sounds a hell of a lot more logical - than you do right now. - Can you just give me - the benefit of the doubt! - Give you the benefit of the... Have you been listening to yourself? - You can't, I'm crazy, right? - No, no, no, no. - No. Rain, please stop it! - I hear things, I see shit... Stop it! Just stop it for a second. Everything is fine over there! When are you get that through your head? What if that was me up there? Oh, my God. There's no one up there. There's no one up there. There's no one up there. It's your mind. Your mind is just playing tricks on you. Please stay away from that house, okay? If she files another complaint... the state is gonna put you in a hospital. Can you promise me? Okay. Come here. So how have you been feeling since you've been home? Better than being strapped down and experimented on. I can't sleep, even though I'm taking my medication, which I don't really need in the first place. We've been through this before, Rain. It's not helping. And I just wanna feel like myself. You realize if you choose to go off your medication, you're likely to end up in an institution where they'll force you to stay on it. I'm so sick of this. I know things are happening, and no one believes me. And then it makes me question whether it's just in my head, even though I know it's real. Is there anything in particular that you're unsure of? Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I think you're stupid? I know they tell you things. Who's "they?" They told you about the little girl, right? What girl? My neighbor is keeping a little girl in her attic. Rain, this is not like your other hallucinations. This is a serious accusation, one that'll likely have equally serious consequences for one of you. I heard her screaming. Have you run through your questions? Mm-hmm. Did anybody else react to her? No. No, she's keeping her hidden. - Why would she do that? - I don't know! I think... I think she kidnapped her, and she's keeping her chained up, and she screams for help. Do you think it's possible that you might be projecting your own fears of feeling confined or restrained? Projecting your own fears of feeling confined and restrained? Help me! Help me! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Help, help! Yeah. What's that? Yeah, I guess it could be possible. - I'm sorry, sweetie, you okay? - Oh, yeah. It's just a cut. I was worried you were Mom. I'm making her dinner to cheer her up. That's nice. What's that? - It's ranch. - Buttermilk aioli? And I see some pan-roasted, leavened bread with herb-infused tomato puree and a blend of artisanal cheeses. Dad, she's coming! Distract her. - Right. - What's going on? Nothing, Mom, please don't come in. Okay, okay. The singularity is near. We're all gonna merge with artificial intelligence. Not me, "we." - But them, "we." I'll be fine. - How's that? Just no social media. No cell phone. You don't have a cell phone? No. Otherwise I would've asked for your number. But I don't. "Do-nut" forget to vote for me! - Will do. - Thank you. Nice kid. Where do you even learn about all that stuff? Oh, you know, online. You can find out anything, if you know what you're looking for. It's actually pretty hypocritical for me to say. - I figured... - Idiot! - What? - Loser is freaking me out. - Get out of here. - You know. Stupid! Why didn't she just die? - Stupid. - Freak. What are you feeling? Can we go outside? Yeah, she parked to the side. - Rain? - One foot, right? - Rain? - Shh! Shh! What are you... What are you doing? - They're gonna take me away. - Who? The cops! My neighbor, she called the cops on me. I think they're just on patrol. You don't believe me? No. I mean, I don't know, I guess. But why would she call the cops? She needs to get rid of me, my neighbor. She kidnapped a little girl. She's keeping her in her attic. Have you told the cops that? - No, I can't. - Why not? - They're on her side! - Dude, this is insane. Yeah. I know! I know. Okay. You're telling me that your neighbor kidnapped a girl and has her chained in her attic right now? And she called the cops on you? - Do you realize how that sounds? - Yeah. I know. Okay. But have you seen the news? Look at Dahmer, no one thought that could happen. He had neighbors. But people are demented! Okay. I just need you to trust me. I do. All right. I... - If this is true, you gotta... - It is true. Okay. I... I just need proof. All right, well, maybe I can... Maybe I can help. Meet me here after school, all right? We... we'll figure it out. Yeah. My mom's here. I gotta go. All right, see you tomorrow. Hey, get in. Okay. - Hey, girl. - Hi. Hi, Rain. It's Dr. Pangloss here. I'm checking to see if you're gonna make it to your appointment today. Hey, where are you going? I thought you left. I did. I had to fill up. Sorry. Here. Get in. Oh, my... Sorry. I kind of crushed it. No. It's actually... It's for you. I made you a little something. - What is it? - Open it. Is it magic? No. You don't like magic. It's a neuron. - Really? - Yeah. You know, I... It's kind of nerdy, you know, but... I don't know, I guess I just like your brain. I love it. Thanks. That's her place. - That's nice. - She inherited it. Okay. How are we gonna do this? Uh... We just wait, I guess, and watch, figure out her schedule. She works Monday through Friday, from 7:00 to 4:00, and has a night class at HCC from 7:00 to 11:00. That's gonna be our prime time. What? Did you just think I was gonna wait for someone else to fix this? I'm not breaking into somebody's house. I need to know. Shh. Come on, come on, come on. Why can't we come back Wednesday when she's at work? Who knows what could happen to her by Wednesday! This is new. It was open before. Well, then, let's just go. We got to find a screwdriver or something! - Hey, look. - So? Maybe she does have a kid. I found one! - What the hell, Rain? - What? You said she works Monday through Friday. It would've been helpful to mention it was at our school. It's not okay. This is really bad. Walls don't bleed, walls don't bleed. Walls don't bleed. - Mom? - I'm sorry. It was just... - You scared me. - I didn't mean to. Just wanted to see what you're seeing. Be careful what you wish for. So, when am I gonna get to meet this Caleb? Probably never. - Why? - Lie. - It wasn't a lie. - I didn't say it was. Yeah, well, I know what you're thinking. What? You wanna know if he's real. Honestly, I don't know if he is or not. I don't care. I like spending time with him, even if he's an illusion. It's not healthy for you, though. How do you know, Mom? You have no idea what it's like to have no one to talk to. I finally have someone to keep me company. And he's not hurting me or anyone else. So, I don't understand what the problem is. It's just... It could be a trigger. And you always have me talk to. That's just not the same. Why? Because I'm real? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I just... I wanna get better. I really... I do. Sometimes I'm just afraid to lose it all. I know, baby. I know. Hey! Let's skip class and go back to her place. - You're joking, right? - No. Rain, I'm not about to break into my teacher's house! Well, you kind of already did. Well, I'm not doing it again. Can't we just hang out and do something normal? Hey, let's go back to the school. I have an idea and this time it doesn't involve anything, you know, illegal. I've been looking online for two weeks. You're not gonna find her. Well, you are severely underestimating my skills here. - How old would you say she was? - Three or four. There's so many of them. The world's full of monsters. All right. Well, we're just gonna have... - to start in Florida. - Okay. And just move out from there. No. Scroll down. You can't even search by gender. It's just... Um... Okay. Try, like... Try Georgia or something. - Any of these look familiar? - Go to that one. - This one? - Yeah. No, that's not her. - What about any of these? - No. You know, that kind that looks... Okay, no. That's not it. Okay. Go back. Try, um... Try South Carolina. Keep going. Scroll, scroll. No. Go back. Try Alabama. I'm telling you, she had this really curly hair. Hmm? Mm-mm. Try North Carolina. Wait, wait, go back up. Oh, my... Oh, my God. That... that's her. That's the little girl. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Malia Robinson missing from Pender County since February. Believed to be abducted from her home. Oh, my God. This is... this... You're ama... Oh, my God. We need to call her parents. And tell them what? Well, tell them that we found her, like... Are you sure that's a good idea? I'm like... I'm like freaking out right now. I need to... Um, I need to grab a drink of water a bit. I'll be right back. Uh, find... Find her contact information, and I'll... I'll be right back. Why are you taking it out on me? I'm not the one who left. Hello? Hello? - God. - Is everything okay? My parents... they just won't even speak to each other. I have no way of paying for college. And it's not just fair, you know. I don't wanna get stuck here. It's not my fault! I... I feel like I can't breathe. No, wait, I can help. - We can grab a... - Stop! Get away from me! I think she's having a panic attack. Just because you're schizophrenic doesn't mean the rest of us are messed up, too! - Hey. - Hey. It doesn't bother me, you know. I just wish you would've told me what it was. They've diagnosed me with so many things, I don't really know what to believe anymore. If you don't wanna be friends after this, I'll understand. You wanna grab something to eat? I don't wanna be insensitive or anything, but what it's like? What do you mean? You know, do you see things? Do you hear things? I don't know. I wanna know everything about it. You know, I... Okay, that's a lot. Sorry, I'm being rude here. I... No, it's fine. Um... Number one, I don't have multiple personalities. A lot people assume that, but it's completely different. All right. So it's just Rain. I mean, not exactly. There's a lot of voices that say the worst things you could possibly imagine. I mean, or that I could. I mean, to be honest, it gets kind of scary not really knowing if I can trust what I see or hear. But a lot of people, they don't have visual hallucinations, just auditory ones. But I have both, so... Sorry. I... I know it's kind of... - weird. - No. It's what makes you you. You know, I... I'm different, you're different. Why should we have to apologize for that, you know? I don't see anybody else apologizing for having diabetes or tuberculosis, you know. Look, Rain, it's... it's okay if she's not real. - I'll see you later? - Yeah. Bye. - Hey, you're home late. - It's only 7:00. Did you do anything today? Mom, if I can get out and socialize, you can, too. I'm proud of you. Hey, Monkey, I've got a surprise for you. Ta-da. What do you think? Yeah, it looks good. You remember that day? Yeah. You and Mom looked so happy. I think I'm gonna stay in the other room for now. Oh, okay. Mommy! Mommy! Do something. Help me. Mom? Mom, what are you doing in here? What's wrong? Is it something I did? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I messed up. No, baby. - No, it's not you. - It's not you. I'm gonna try to be better, I promise. I'm sorry. Just like taking a candy from a baby. Right, Ms. McConnell? No one's reacting. He's not real. Rain? - Idiot. - You're stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Rain. Rain. Rain? He's not real. What were you thinking? You're stupid. Don't forget to turn in your papers, if you haven't done it already. Like whatever. Rain? Rain? What are you doing here? - You've been ignoring me. - Yeah. Yeah. And... I wasn't expecting you would admit that. Yeah. Well, I did. And I've been ignoring you - because you're not real. - I am real. No, you're in prison. You're a prism. What? Okay. Number one, is it possible? No. The answer is no. No one like you exists in real life. I do... And what makes you think I'm not real? You're just too perfect. What? Okay. That's a first. No, I... You're like perfectly imperfect. I really don't wanna keep talking about this with you. Well, too bad because now I'm not going anywhere. I mean... This is bad enough to find friends out here, much less... Stop. You need to go, whether you're real or not. No, I am real. And you're a little different, yeah. I don't care about that. I mean, I do, I... I care about it. I just... I like you. - What was that? - What? You heard her? - I heard something. - It was Malia! - Well, it could've been a cat. - No, it wasn't a cat! We should call the police then. - No, I can't! - Why not? You just said it could've been a cat. And if I'm wrong, they'll put me away. Okay. Well, what do you want us what to do? We're good. Through here. Come on. Hey. I think we can get in through the garage. What's going on? - Enough is enough, John. - Dani, what's going on? It's one thing when she's having issues, but now she's vandalizing my home and making accusations that could end my career. Slow down. What? What did... I've worked my ass off for my retirement, I cannot afford to have that jeopardized. What do you want me to do? - You know what you need to do. - No. I really don't. You need to take her into the hospital. Do you want me just lock my kid up and just sweep her under the rug? You know, I get that you're in a tough place, but if you don't take her in, I'm filing charges. Excuse me, hold on a minute. - Dani, seriously. - No, I... I'm done. I'm done. - Excuse me. Dani. - I'm done! - Dani, just... - I can't. Please, just... I told you not to go over there. - What were you thinking? - John. She has a giant doll house in her garage. Yeah. She's got 100 dolls in her attic. She's weird. Who the hell cares? This is all part of her plan. She's gonna trap her in there. - Are you listening to yourself? - That's what she wants! She wants you to think I'm crazy, so that can send me away. You broke into somebody's house, Rain. I didn't break into it, - Caleb broke the window. - Oh, Christ! This... This again. No, she only reported seeing you. Well, she maybe just didn't see him, but he was there. He heard her scream! Caleb doesn't exist, okay? - Seriously, you need to stop. - Stop? Stop what? If I wasn't sick, you would never even be saying... - You are sick! - But I'm not my sickness! Yes, you are! We all are! You're going to Westbrook. - Don't you dare say that! - What? No! I've had enough of this. You're both out of control. Have you been taking your medicine? Yes. Have you? It doesn't matter what I say anyways, - you don't believe me. - Come here. Come here. - Stop. Get off! - Come here. Get your fucking hands off me. Take your medicine. Already taken it today. - Take another dose. - No! Dad, stop! - What are you... Stop! - Take it! Is this what you want, Dad? You want me to take them all, - get out of your hair for good? - What are you doing? Okay. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Don't say that. Don't ever say that again. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. I'm sorry. Sorry doesn't make it okay. - What are we gonna do? - Nice of you to show up after your disappearing act. What? You ran, I ran. And... Well, she called the cops. She's filing charges to have me sent away. What? Where? - I gotta go to class. - No. If you leave, what's gonna happen to Malia? You mean the cat next door? So, what's your plan? We can climb up the ladder and break through the window. While she's home? That's not gonna do any good. She will call the cops, get us arrested. We have to do something before she kills her. What... What makes you think she's gonna kill her? She knows that I know! She's gonna kill her and it's all gonna be my fault! and I'm gonna be the one who just sit and even do anything to save her or... - Rain! - I can't... We need to come up with a coherent plan, okay? Panicking is not gonna help. Let me get you some water, all right? Wrong one. You take all these? Not exactly. They're constantly changing them up to see what's most effective. I can't sleep on any of them, though. Studies have found strong links between insomnia and intellect, so. And I'm sure that's what it is. Just me being a genius. How can you be playing cards right now? It helps me when I'm nervous. Here... try it again, pick one. Nope. You pick one. Yeah? What are you gonna do with those? Just pick a card. - Rain? - Yeah, Mom? Hey, hi. I'm sorry. Who is this? Um, this is Caleb. Caleb, this is my mom. Wait, you can see him? Of course I can see him. I was so nervous of... Never mind. Don't let me interrupt your date. It's not a date, Mom. - We're just friends. - Mm-hmm. I don't think we should wait. Let's go Wednesday, after... You know, actually, I... I gotta go. But I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. Did I ruin your date? All right. All right, guys, come on. You're late. Come on in. Take a seat. Let's get started. I told you. - I told you. - Rain? He's not real. I told you. He's not real. He's not real. - Loser. - Rain. Kill yourself. Rain? No, no! Rain. Rain, are you okay? Rain, can we talk for a moment? You should just die. No one likes you. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. You're a freak. You should kill yourself. Rain? I think you need to go see the nurse. You're crazy. You're crazy. Hi. You've reached the Burroughs residence. Hi, I... I need to talk to Dr. Pangloss. She's over at the hospital, Ms. Burroughs. But I can let her know you wanna speak to her. Um, no, I need to see her now. - Sorry. - She's not here. Dr. Pangloss! Dr. Pangloss! Dr. Pangloss! Rain! Rain! - Save me. - Rain. Rain. ‚ô™ Rain, Rain, go away Come again another day ‚ô™ You're crazy. - You're crazy. - Get it together. You're losing it. She's not real. She's gonna die and you're gonna be locked up where you belong. They're better off without you. Get it together. - Stop! - Stop! Stop! Rain, honey? Rain. Rain, sweetheart. I saw a man with yellow eyes. He wants to take me as his prize. Cries. Cries. She cries. Cry me a river and watch me drown. - No sound, it's all too loud. - No, no, sweetheart. Put it down. Put it down. Okay. All right. You're okay. You're okay, you're safe. You're safe. You're safe. You're safe. You're safe. Sweetheart, you're safe. - Wait, Malia, Malia. - No. No, Rain. Rain! - No, I won't let you. - Won't let me what, Mom? This is your fault in the first place! I wouldn't be dealing with any of this, if you hadn't made me sick! I'm... I hate you. Rain, please. Please, if you go over there, they will take you away from us. I don't care. What if it was me? I'm not just gonna sit here - and wait. - No. No. Rain! - Rain? Open the door! - Mom's making a big deal - out of this, and I've got this. - We need to talk. Move away from the window, please. I'm not gonna jump, Dad! I was just... - Honey, listen to your dad. - You ruin everything! There's no one there. Yeah. She is! She's right there. Your mom... She's not here. She passed away three years ago, baby. No. That's not true. - It's true. I'm sorry. - Why are you doing this to me? I'm not doing anything to you. You need to know the truth. What about at dinner? She was there. We were all there. Was anyone else reacting? Yes, Dad. Yes, you were. - You were reacting. - Because I was trying... Dad, she's coming! Distract her. - Right, right. - What's going on? Nothing, Mom. Look... I was just trying to... This whole time? Mom's coming. I didn't know what to do... Right, right. ...when you started seeing her again. - Nothing to see here. - Nothing, Mom. Don't come in. Coast is clear. I tried to remind you that she was gone, but it was really, really hard seeing you relive that loss over and over and over again. Yeah, Mom? But after a while... your reality with her was just so much... It was so much happier... than mine without her. And I was... I was... I was so afraid. I was just so terrified that you... That you... That you would wanna go... to be with her. How do I know you're not lying to me? Hmm? - Rain... - How do I know you're not - just messing with my head? - Why would I do that? Why'd you lie to me in the beginning? You're just trying to get to my head. - Stop fucking with my head! - Just stop! Stop! - What are you doing? - I'm calling 911. - No! Stop! - Rain! Rain! Come back! Rain! Malia is already dead! Don't listen to her. - She's lying. - This is your fault. - She's lying. - Do something. She's lying. Help me. Shit. Malia? Help. - Help her! - You can still see her! Malia? It's okay. I'm here to help you. Save me. - Save me. - Stop. No, no, you're not real. I need to save Malia. There is no Malia! It's always been me. You should kill yourself. No, no, no, no. She's real. She's real. - You did this... - No, no. ...to me. Look at me. You can't leave me. I don't want to. I'm sorry. I don't want you to go away. I don't have to. I don't wanna be crazy, Mom. - Help me. - Malia? She's made up, Rain. No, she's not, Mom. You are. Hi. Here's your order. Thanks. - Keep the change. - Have a good one. It's too late. It's too late. She's dead. It's too late. It's too late. - You killed her. - It's too late. - No. - Wait. - You're too late. - Save Malia. It's not too late. - Don't do it. - Go back. Keep going. No. Stop! Stop it! Malia, are you here? Malia. Malia, hi. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Okay. Ah! Hello? Is anybody down there? Hello? Oh! Oh. Oh, gosh. Rain, you scared the hell out of me. Oh, gosh. Oh! Here, let me help you. Don't trust her. Here. Rain, take my hand. That's right. I don't want anything to hurt you. - You can't trust her. - You can trust her. - It's okay. - You're just gonna die. She's not real, Rain. - There's no one there, Rain. - She's lying. There's no little girl there. - Either one of you. - Save Malia. Malia, Malia, come here, come here. Come here, come here. Wait. Don't do this. She's gone. She's not real, Rain. You made her up in your head. You're gonna die. Don't you do this. - Listen to me. - Liar! - She's a liar, Rain. - Put that down. There's something wrong with you, Rain. Just... - You're the crazy one. - You're crazy. - You're gonna die. - Let me help you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let me help you. Does your dad know you're here? I don't... I don't think so. No. I don't have to tell him. We can just keep this between us, okay? Why would you do that? Because I know what happens when they institutionalize people and I don't want that happening to you. You have been through so much already. I just don't know what to believe anymore. You've seen that she's not real. There's no little girl. You can just go on home and we'll keep this between us. - Okay? - Rain? Caleb, don't come down here. Who are you talking to, Rain? There's no one there. This is your head. This is... Go, Rain, get her out of here! Make a decision, Rain. A figment of your imagination, or the real thing? No, no! No! You think I was gonna let you get away with this? I would've let you go. I don't want anyone to die. But you couldn't let things be. Get her out of here, Rain! Rain. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. It's just me. It's just me. You're safe. - Are you okay? - Yeah. She's real? Come on, come on, come on. I need to go back inside. Caleb's... No, no, no, no, no, no. I got you. I got you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I need to go back inside. - Caleb... - No, no, no, no, no, no. He's not real, Rain. He's not real. Call EMT. Hey, there. You all right? He is real. Check out the neighbor's house. Hey, we got another one over here. I love you. I'm so proud of you, monkey. Hey, it's gonna be okay. They're gonna take good care of you, get you back to your mom and dad. Okay? I promise. You're such a brave girl. Hi. When you said that wasn't a date, what did you, uh... What did you mean? Because it felt kinda... I don't know, datey to me. - Did it? - Yeah. I mean, granted I don't have that much experience... with that sort of thing, but... You mean, like, dates? Yeah. But maybe we can have some more of them... when I'm out of this? Hmm. We could maybe arrange that. I'd like that. Personally. For the first time, I can feel the medicine working. I can finally tell the difference between what's real and what's not. But do you still hear the voices and... Yeah. They're still there, but not as, like... But yeah. What about mom? Do you still see her? No. I miss her. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah? I think I'm gonna move back into my room. Oh, okay. Sounds like a plan. I'm here, baby girl. I love you so, so much. I love you, too.
