"On such days when everything is white and there is no longer any difference between the earth and the sky, then the dead can talk to us who still are living." -Unknown source A WHITE A WHITE, WHITE A WHITE, WHITE DAY Grandpa, can you turn on the light? Yes, wait a second. Shit, what a mess. This will be your mom's room. Of course we're gonna put a door here. It's not finished yet, but it will look really nice when you move in. Look here… We have running water. You wanna see your room? - So, what do you think? - It’s great. What was that sound? How did you get in here? Grandpa, he broke a plate. You're not supposed to be in here. Here… have some bread and then you’re going outside. - Give him a push. - Come on. How is the house coming along? It's weatherproof. - Was it your fathers? - No. - I mean the land, not the... - The land, yes. - And it's all yours now? - Mine and my brother's. - You're quite close, right? - He lives here. Would you say your relationship is positive or negative? Positive or negative? - I mean, are you... - Well, it's not negative. So I guess it's on the positive side. How are you sleeping? I sleep like a rock. One always sleeps better after doing some physical work, don’t you agree? I don't know. Are you still having nightmares? No. Are you sometimes lonely? - No. - Never? Not when I'm around my granddaughter. Do you feel like… people understand you? Yes. Do you want people to understand you? Understand what? There's nothing to understand. - Do you think you've changed? I don't know. Do you know who you are? Who I am? Yes. Who are you? Ingimundur. Describe yourself. I am a man. More detailed. Father. Grandfather. Policeman. Widower. What do you want? What do I want? What do you want, Ingimundur? To build a house. What don’t you want? To stop building it. How would you describe… a perfect day? Morning. - Hello, Salka. - Hi. Here, have some. By the way, she got a stain on her dress that needs to be removed. Can you help her with that? Fish blood. I think it’s quite simple. You just mix candle wax with red wine… Why would you do that? That’s ridiculous. And then you wait for the candle wax to crumble and... Call your mother. Okay. How is it going, Bjössi. Busy? Mostly because of the weather. - It’s been really strange… - I know. It was covered in fog this morning, but it’s much better now. Salka, can you fetch the bag from the car. Not right now… I've just got one question, how do you get blood out of clothing? No, nothing like that. There’s just some fish blood on her dress. Yes, alright. Ingimundur, Vanish… You just spray Vanish on the dress and then put it in the machine? She needs to wear it today. She needs to wear the dress later today. Yes. Thank you. Wait a minute. - It’s still alive! - Must be the farmed salmon. - Look. That’s good. One more time. - Come on. - Give it to him. Look, he’s gone now. Put your shoes on. When I'm angry or annoyed or something like that… What did you just take? Vitamins. Anyways, if I’m angry or annoyed or something, then I’m more likely to fart. Is that so? Yes, because then I'm more stiff, and can just suddenly... Right. Come on. Or if I’m really stressed out about something, but I'm not stressed now or anything. That’s good. There you are! Welcome brother. My God, you're pretty. You’re drooling over me! Look what I found in the trash. - Hi, sweetheart! - Kiss your mother. - What is that? - What is what? That stain… Come help your cousin a little. There you go. You just put the ice cubes in this bowl. Can I get a hammer too? - Can I try? - No, not now. Here you go. Hello, hello... You can fight outside. The bag with the stuff, is it in the car? Yes, and bring the box as well. - The box? - Just bring the box. I finally gathered up enough courage to pack all her stuff. It's in that box. A lot of beautiful things she had. Drawings and... I'm sorry. No, seriously… I shouldn't be talking about this now. It's alright. It's just that something changed within me when I drove past that place... I found it. And the box is by the front door. - Do you have a mom? - No. - Do you have a dad? - Yes. - You do have a dad? - No. - Are you a monkey? - Yes. - So... you are a monkey? - Yes. Do you eat shit? Yes. Okay, so you are a monkey with no parents that eats shit? No! I didn't light the house on fire, did I? Enough. Go inside. Get some sleep. I just wanted to... Damn... What's wrong? I miss mom. I know, let’s not talk about it now. Let's go to bed, darling. She made me and now she isn't here anymore... Sorry about that. This happens sometimes suddenly. I don't know… Maybe she should stop drinking. Shut up Stefán! Just take care of her. Yes, of course. I didn't mean it like that, not at all. Well, good night. And thanks for the evening. On a cold winter night, a young couple is found dead in a remote chalet in a deep fjord. A masterly woven plot. Five stars. The best book in the world. I could neither eat nor sleep from the moment I opened the book... Hello. Who is it? And some kind of crystal I’m not sure if that’s a stone? Mom once found an awesome one. It was huge. Some kind of crystal, I think. We are here. - Bye, grandpa. - Bye, sweetie. Dammit. Goddam, it's good to see you here. But those shorts… Something hits the side of the boat and I drop the goddamn thing. And everything falls straight to the floor. Are you back at work? No, I was just looking for something at my desk. - Don't you want a cup of coffee? - I need to pick up the girl. Ingimundur. Fine, I'll be there. This one clearly has the best nose. I do. Angel baby, my angel baby. Whoo who, I love you, whoo, I do. No one could love you like I do. Are you coming? Hey, don't do that. - Ow! - I'm sorry. There, there. Is it turned on? So, what do you think? About what? Me. I think you're beautiful. What more? Warm. More. Take me! Be rough. I love you. How are you feeling? She is better now but she vomited three times. I know it’s late, but Stefán needs to go to work early and… I can't have the little one getting sick too. It’s not a problem. There are some extra clothes and clean underwear in her bag. I'll get some shampoo and her toothbrush... Put the sheet and everything she puked on in a plastic bag, I'll wash it. Thanks dad! - You didn’t puke in the toilet? - No. Just on the pillow, and the sheets and the bed. Pretty much everywhere. - Grandpa, can you tell me a story? - A story? Do you want a nice one or a scary one? A scary one, I think. All right then. Once upon a time, when my dad was just a little boy, his mom sent him to the grocery store to buy sheep liver. But on his way to the store, he ran into a few of his friends. And he went to play with them on the beach. When they finished playing, it was getting late and he noticed that the money wasn't in his pocket anymore and... He lost it? Yes, and he was very sad because now he couldn't buy the liver for his mother. What did he do? My dad didn't want to get scolded, so he went to the cemetery... and found a fresh grave... which he dug up... …with his hands. He dug up a casket? Yes, it’s true. Let me finish the story. So, he opened up the casket and found an old rotten corpse inside. The smell was overwhelming and he retched and puked as he cut into the rotten body with his pocketknife… …and stole its liver. Later that night, they had liver for dinner but my dad didn't have any appetite. So, he went to bed hungry and couldn't fall asleep, his stomach was growling. Suddenly he heard something. A strange sound. Do you know what it was? He got out of bed and looked out the window. It was dark outside but he saw something moving, something in the distance that was moving closer to the house. A dark figure. He opened the window slowly... and listened. It was like the figure was trying to say something. "Give me back my liver. Give me my liver back.” My father quickly closed the window, and jumped into bed. But at the same moment, he heard the front door open. He went under the covers and tried to be as silent as he could while he listened. Do you know what he heard? He heard footsteps. The figure was walking up the stairs, towards his bedroom. "Give me back my liver. Give me my liver back.” My dad was so scared... that he hid under the covers. - Grandpa, don't... - Shush, wait. And then he heard the bedroom door open up… He held his breath while the floorboards creaked as the figure walked closer towards the bed. “Give me back my liver,” said the dark figure. And with its cold, dead hands... Gotcha! What are you doing? I'm sick. - Goddam lies! - No, it's true, really. It's true! Jesus. Kids? Oh my God! Where are we? Are you alive? Oh my God! We crashed. Wake up! Are you alive? Are you alright? Oh God, what just happened? One, two, three, four, five. Marius is missing! Marius! Look, there he is. - Where’s the remote? - I don't know. Get down. - Are you alive? - Yes. That is just great news! Let's help Marius, kids. He's alive. Let's give him a hug. Let's all give Marius a hug. Oh, Marius. That's enough! That's enough! This is what I was talking about. For the bathroom. Look at this. How the tiles go all the way up. Don't you think it's nice? Yes, it's nice. - Was it this one? - Don't you think it's nice? Yes, I think so. - Was it this one? - Just put it on the floor. No. Shush. Shut up! - Can you just... Please. - I wasn't winding him up. Where is the phone, Dad? Sit. Stay. Just put him outside! Come here. What’s the matter with you! Are you fucking retarded? Thanks. Now everybody in the world, do like me! Brruu... Go away, mud! And one more time! One, two and... Brruu... Go away, mud! You are doing great! You all get an extra point! Extra point! Congratulations! Isn't this fun? Congratulations! This is the best day in the world. Kids, hurry up. We’ve got to get to safety! The weather is getting worse! Be careful, the machine could explode. Oh my God. Oh, no. Are you still dead? That is terrible. We miss you so much. Isn't that right? Yes. I can’t do this anymore… I'm afraid of the unknown. I don't wanna die now. I want to live longer. Just a little bit longer. Life is too short. It’s too short! But everyone dies. Our dreams die… Our grandpas and grandmas die, as well as our parents and siblings. Your big sister and your cute little brother will also die. And you, and you! And all of you sitting at home. You will all die! I'm so afraid. Kids, I can feel something… a vibration… Do you have anything against Olgeir? I need to talk to you shortly, can you come by tonight? No. Not tonight. But I can come by tomorrow. No, never mind. Yes, I want to come. I can help you out with the house. Ingibjörg also wants to have you over for dinner. I said that Ingibjörg wants to have you over for dinner. Yes, you just said that. Oh, it’s you? Are you going to help me today? Yes, maybe. But you smell… Where's your mom? I don't know, she just dropped me off. - What’s she up too? - Who? Your mother. How should I know? Kids don’t think about what adults or old people are doing. Old people? Do you think I'm old? Yes, a little. But you're still the best... or the second best. What? Who's the best? Grandma was by far the best. She knew Tóta the Ragdoll by heart. What do you know? Salka? What's up? When do you think you'll finish this? Soon, in a month or two. Don't you think you'll just end up living here yourself? No, this is only temporary. I'll move out when this is finished so Elín and Salka can move in. And Stefán. Yes, and him. What a view! Have you cheated on Ingibjörg? Yes. Why are you asking? Often? No. But it has happened. You know that. I know that she's not gonna be the only woman I'll fuck for the rest of my life. I’m not going to ruin anything. I love her more than anything in the world. She’s mine, I own her. She doesn’t need to know about this. I mean, you don't need to know everything. I’m sure she would like to fuck someone else sometimes. It’s just normal. You think so? - What? - Do you think she wants that? To be with someone else? I don't know. I’ve never really thought about it. Why are you asking? What about your conscience? What about it? Don't you care? You never feel guilty? Sure… But still… I think… It’s quite normal. She was always enough for me somehow. I never needed anything else. She used to cut my hair… I think I miss that. You were good together. Everyone thought so. I think she was cheating on me. Why do you think that? I always had a feeling that she… …was hiding something. That there was something she wasn't telling me. Do you know with whom? No. But I'm… Okay, it's ready. - Ready? - Yes. Almost. Wow! Shit. That was great. Was it Mozart? No. Beethoven? - No, it's something Schumann. - Schumann. - He wrote it for his kids. - Okay. Did he have many... Before he went mental. Gulla told me… that he was married to a woman who then fell in love with another man. - Then he jumped off a bridge. - Shit, did he survive? Yes… But then he died at a mental hospital. And the woman then fell in love with another famous composer. His name was Brahamms. I think. He wrote that famous song... Ah, yes. Stop that. What was that? Wait here. But we are obligated to meet once a week and as you know the roads are closed. So, this will have to do for today. Please have a seat and imagine I'm sitting right in front of you. Speaking of desks, your receipt is in the desk drawer. To the right, your right that is, my left. Please, go right ahead and get it. Did you find it? I can't see you Ingimundur, did you find the receipt? It's in my pocket. The connection must be a bit slow, the sound is very good but it's like you disappear sometimes. Shouldn't we just skip the session today and meet up next week? No, I want us to talk. It's important. Let's at least try. Have you ever memorized what you were going to say to me, before we met up? What? Rehearsed the answers, that is. No. Sorry, I couldn't hear the answer. I said no. I think it might help if you would practice more self-compassion. I feel like you are being too self-critical. And I think it is hurting you more than we realized at first. And... yes, thank you. If we try to focus more on the positive thoughts, you know, just good memories. Instead of constantly focusing on the loss.. then I think we might... Stop it. Did you say something? I thought you said something but I couldn't see your lips moving. Anyway, I think it might help to bring forth those contradictory feelings. Laughing and crying, love and hate and so on. Are you there, Ingimundur? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I know exactly what's going on and what you are trying to do. It's hard to grieve alone... Stop it! If it didn't matter to me then it wouldn't be like this, but it is how it is and I don't want to change anything... Have you ever cried because of what happened? What did you just say? Have you ever cried because of what happened? What is your most treasured memory? What memory triggers the biggest fear in you? Do you regret something specific? Why is this door locked? Do you have suicidal thoughts? Open! Open the door! Why do you think I'm asking you all these questions, Ingimundur? Why do you think that? When we truly love someone, with all our heart, we want to do everything in our power to not hurt that person. Morning. - Hi, Salka. - Hi. - Can't I offer you something? - No, thank you. - Do you want one? - No, thank you. Don't you wanna have coffee with us? Ingimundur. - Have some coffee with us. - No. The carpenters are waiting for me. We need to have a talk before you leave. Why? About what? Georg called. He told us what happened. What happened? That you attacked him at the office. Attacked him? Salka, let's go. You know what we mean. We just came from there, you completely wrecked it. Who is wrecked? Shush, go wait in the car. I'm coming. Ingimundur… we've been trying to call you. Georg called the police in Reykjavík. They want you to go there now for a check-up. I'll go tomorrow. - Wait a second. - What? Why don't you sit down with us and tell us what happened? Didn't you hear what I said. The carpenters are waiting. You also need to hand over your keys to the station. What did you say? You need to hand over your keys. Who do you think you're talking to? For Christ's sake, stop this nonsense! We're always trying to be nice to you. You've just completely crossed the line. No, Bjössi. Seriously. - Let's all calm down. - This has gone too far. Thank you. Guys... I said thank you, Ingimundur. Are you gonna give me the keys? Are you serious? Put those stupid goddamn keys in my goddamn fucking hand! Ingimundur! This is so fucking stupid! Calm down! Or I'll empty the fucking can on your face! Let go! I'm very sorry about this. Water! Water, Ingimundur! Where are you going? Ingimundur! Ingimundur, are you there? - Ingimundur! - Shut up Bjössi. Elín! Elín! Dammit… Your mom will be here in a minute. Just go inside. Is no one home? Just do as I tell you. I heard Bjössi screaming, what were you doing to him? Nothing. - Were you trying to kill him? - No, of course not. - Are you going to steal his car? - Salka! Just go inside and watch TV or something, and this is my car! You know I get scared sometimes when I'm alone. You're nine years old. - I'm eight. - Turning nine. Is Bjössi dead? For goodness' sake girl! What's all this about? You don't stop for a second. You yap constantly… Do I need to put a muffler on you? What is it with kids today? You're all spoiled brats and need constant goddamn attention! I’m not going to debate with you anymore. I’ve had enough of talking to kids. Get your ass inside and stop acting like a baby. Aren't you taking me down to the station? What is going on, Ingimundur. Where are you taking me? - Ingimundur, what are we doing here? - Step outside. You can't be serious. Walk towards the light. Towards the light, what the hell is out there? And what are you doing with that? Go on. At least put that goddamn gun away. Seriously. What's going on here? Let’s stop for a moment. What's this all about? I want to know what the fuck... Okay! Okay! God dammit. What are we doing here, seriously? I honestly don't have a clue about what's going on. I'm telling you, this has to be a misunderstanding. What is it you think I've done? No, hold on. What is this? - Get into the hole. - No, no. I'll tell you everything, okay? I promise I’ll tell you the truth. I have a wife and children who I love more than anything in the world. Don't do this. Seriously. Don't do this. I beg you. Not like this. I will tell you the truth. Sit down. Alright. Okay, can we then talk now? I'll let you go if you tell me the truth and answer all my questions. I promise. If you lie to me, I'll shoot you in the stomach and bury you alive. I swear. Did you know my wife? Yes. How? My boy was in her class. Did you have anything to do with her death? What? No! Do you really think that? Ingimundur, you don't think that I... Were you involved with her? Wait, let's back up a bit… Were you fucking my wife? Yes, but I swear on my children's lives that I didn't have... For how long? Ingimundur, it was nothing. How long? I don't know. It happened by mistake. And then nothing for a while... Just answer the question. You knew about it. She told me you knew. How many times? I don't know. Maybe… ten times, or less. Where did you meet up? Where? You wanna know where? At school and then in the car. In your car? - Does that really matter? - Answer. In her car. Do you think of her? Now, yes. Sometimes. What do you think about? Just about her and how she was… I mean, we were friends… You were friends? - Of course we were friends. I don't know what to tell you. Describe her. What do you mean? Tell me about her. She was... a great person. She was warm, and funny. Was she beautiful? Yes, she was beautiful. More beautiful than your wife? - Ingimundur, I love my... - Answer the question! Yes, she was more beautiful than my wife. But that wasn’t the reason for… Then why did it happen? We were just in a similar place in our lives… We were going through stuff. What are we doing here? I'm sorry but I don't understand what we are doing here. Describe when you were with her. What am I supposed to say? How was it fucking my wife? What do you mean by how? Shall I tell you how? Okay, she wanted me to fuck her in her classroom and in the car. I've told you this already! What did she say? Say? She didn't say anything. Nothing at all? Why should she say something? No, she didn't say anything, she never said anything. She didn't tell you anything! Did she? She didn't do that. She lied! Because she was human, like me! What is wrong with you? Why do you want to hear all this? She liked fucking me, I liked fucking her. She liked it when I got bigger in her mouth. Is this what you wanna hear, you sick fuck!? Who's that? Wait... I just wanted to tell you that it wasn’t me that called the police. My wife called because I just disappeared and... That's why she called, she was scared. My granddaughter is with me. I swear, I won't say a word. It's okay, it's over now. I crossed the line. I'm sorry. I didn't say a word, I didn't call... Who the fuck do you think you are? -Who the fuck do you think you are!? - Grandpa! Go away! Stop it! Stop it! You don't do that to someone. Listen to me. Look at me! Look me in the eyes when I talk to you! Who does this? - Calm down. Answer! Who does shit like this? Stop it! Do you know how it feels? To be humiliated like... Put your seatbelt on. There, there… - Put your seatbelt on! - Yes! There, there. Grandpa, you're covered in blood. There's blood everywhere. There, there. It's all right. It's over now. Grandpa is here, sweetheart. Grandpa is here. There, there. It's all over now. My love. Wait a moment. Don't go. Wait. Don't go. I'm not going anywhere, just wait here for a moment. What are you doing? Shush. Listen. What is that? It's the river. Why is it so loud? It's rushing down to the shore. Climb on my back. Everything is going to be fine. We'll just walk home. Grandpa… are you crying? No, I'm not crying. I'm just tired. Very, very tired. I'm sorry I called you an asshole. When did you do that? Yesterday. It's alright. You can just sometimes be a little... angry or annoyed. Is that so? Yes. And you sometimes yell at me. I never yell at you. Yes, you do. When did I do that? Yesterday. Show me. What? Show me how I yelled at you. I'm not gonna do that. No really, I wanna hear it. Show me how the angry man yelled at you. The angry man? I'm not gonna yell at... Stop it! Shit. Did you hear that? What? The echo? I'm angry! Your turn. You're right. What? I can be a monster sometimes. Is it you?
