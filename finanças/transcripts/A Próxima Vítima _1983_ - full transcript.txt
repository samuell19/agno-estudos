Nothing to declare! Dr. Orlando, should the opposition win... Would you accept a job with the new government? Excuse me. But what shall I write for my paper? Say what you want. I'd like to believe in all of this. Why don't you? What's the good? This election is a fucking lie, changing nothing. It's your problem if you believe in nothing. My problem? You'll see... Mr. Clean, the new leader, You'll see what'll happen. When the chips are down, they'll vote the others in. It is important that the opposition wins. What opposition? There's nothing else. They're all alike, all government. Think the rich will side with the people? It's easy to bet that nothing will work out. I'm sick of it all! I can see that! You're playing around but I must live in this shitty country. I want to see what the shitty opposition will do. with all the misery you see around here The police being stronger than the government. And those people vote for PDS! When I was a boy I wanted to change everything. Now look! Know him? Never saw him before. Does he look like a criminal? All those photos are alike. Are you mad? Look here, companion. This photo. Give it space. With the interview. Do it again! Do the best you can. Cut this. Put in a close up of the man. Do a lead. Here goes the title. Cut here. Put this face in. But big. This here is burnt. Burnt...did you burn it? After 4 murders in the last few days There's a terror in the air here in Braz. Police Inspector Dr. Orlando Parone says: Various witnesses identified for us the Braz sex maniac as a black man, tall, and skinny. This is the man, Nomato Luis da Silva, alias Nê. Ex-convict and confessed author of various crimes. We wouldn't give out this information If we weren't absolutely sure about our facts They all lead to this suspect. The testimony of the girls and the study of the intimate lives of thousands of patrons of the hotels where the murders were committed. - Is that all? - It's weak. Take care, will you, kid? Who's the guy? Your man? I think you better leave and stop bothering people. Is he your protector? We're looking for trouble. You give him your dough in exchange for what? Shit, get off my back, will you? Why does he get your dough? Does he feed you? Dress you? Does he pay for you shitty bed here? Do you depend on him? You're a cop. What? A finking, lousy stoolie. What do you want from me? Think you'll get something out of me? You can beat me up, take my blood, you can kill me, but I won't speak to a cop. - I'm not a cop! - Who got the black guy? You aired his picture on TV. Not me, the police. I'm a reporter, I don't own this shit. They changed everything. It's all wrong. All he wants is to get Silvia out. Silvia? Who's Silvia? Idiot. I want to help him. To get him out. Don't touch me. I screw anybody but a cop. And get lost! I saw you on TV yesterday. It seems everybody did. Sure. On prime time. They'll say they'll present the Braz murderer. So what? Do you know him? Who? But what's the matter? And Silvia? So I'm supposed to know everybody now? I must find the black guy. He's innocent. To prove his innocence he must appear on TV and contradict Orlando. I know he's innocent. I must find him. But listen, when? Now. It's important Listen, we'll meet in an hour at the snooker parlor. This is David Duarte. I told you about him. Well? Don't you want to talk to him? I don't know what you're talking about. But he only wants to help, get it? He only wants to help, No. OK then. Let's have another beer. To loosen up. That's good! I want to help, Silvia. I believe he's innocent. Really? And what is it to you, man? Nothing. But it's the truth. I can prove the police are wrong. Police? They're never wrong. They take who they want. He didn't want to play their game. Now look at him. Let's say this on TV. Say it. It's your TV. What does he want? Just tell me. This little girl there. I must see him. He must make a statement. Statement? Yes. And I must talk to him. I'll put his statement on the air. Easy! I give her to anybody, why not to him. But easy! Do what you're told! Just do what you're told! It's just a game. Who are you? Don't pay attention. Tomorrow at 5, on the other side of the street. But be alone. The nigger's brother. Get lost. You don't like him, that's the problem. You're always saying the same thing, But then you're white. You're the reporter. You're on TV. You're good. The other one's black, and a bandit You needed one to show off. So you find a negro and all's well. If there are more murders: easy. Find another negro. There are a lot of us. We're even the majority. I only want to help. If you betray him, I'll kill you. Hold it. He already knows. The guy's coming in. Just hold it, ok? Sit down. Take this. There's only one thing to calm me down. I'm very nervous, see? What do you want? I want a statement of yours for TV. My face on TV again. You can say what you want. I do, but it'll come out as you want it. I'll fight for it to come out right. On prime time. Of course. In the first news. But that's fantastic! Fantastic! You can defend yourself, tell millions of viewers you're a victim of the system. And you'll air everything I say, without cuts. Yes. I told you I'll fight for you. Let me switch this on. Want to stand up or sit down? I'll stand up. Hey, you guys! What do you think? Am I pretty enough for TV? Perhaps some makeup. I'll be a big TV star. Be serious, will you? Serious. Well, look here.

When he was 18... he was marked to die. He only escaped because he was arrested. he was arrested! One year they kept him in jail he learned everything that's bad... to drink, use drugs. Not to work any more. And all the time we had the cops at home. All the time! So he became a drug pusher. Lately, I was trying to help him. I was helping him to go straight again. I know, that's why. He stopped taking drugs. and wouldn't push them any more. Brazil was waiting for this celebration. More than 100 thousand Brazilians together... But why not? Impossible. Don't argue. It's still being studied. It's premature. If you say more, you're being arrogant. You're guessing... There's no way to work here. I'm not in a condition to work. What's the problem? Can't be done Why can't it be done? But you can work. You do. But not like this! There's no way! Nice you're back. That was quite a story. And Luna? I looked for her and couldn't find her. That's all right. The cops got the murderer. He's not a murderer! and all the press we've got... With the press he'll be careful in Braz. Everything will be all right... We have democracy now. Easy! I'd like to apologize... I was self-sufficient... egocentric... an idiot... a visionary, and schizophrenic. Alienated, Male chauvinist, Guevarist Maoist, and other "ists". We will not continue to follow our legality. Let me answer. Hello? Hello? Luna?! David! No, David! Son of a bitch! Arrest me, arrest me! No. Go away. Now these times are different. Go away.
