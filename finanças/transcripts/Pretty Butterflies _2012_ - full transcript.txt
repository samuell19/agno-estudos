Oh, ugly bastard ! Hey, blind freak... So ? What are you doing' here ? You're not home here, okay ? - What's to look at ? - You're not home here, get it ? Where are you going' ? Tonio had been threatening him for a long time. You can tell he hates him by his look when they meet, he's always looking for a chance to kick his ass. Now pick that stuff up ! Pick it up! But I thought he was kidding when he said: "I'll kill that guy one day". If I burn your eyes out, what'll you do ? Instead, the 3rd of August was the day of Gigi's murdering, He's from the 5th floor, my beloved. He never dared lay a hand on me, if he tried I'd cut it off. If they touch your peach as a kid, you'll get like my sister Mandarina: knocked up at 13. Now she's 20 and is in the life at a brothel... It's not as filthy as the streets, but you still have to suck some shithead's gross dick. When she got pregnant, she gave me her clothes, even her Speedo. Who are you talking to ? What do you want ? I don't want to be like her. I want to be a rockstar. Yeah, a rockstar ! You don't believe me, do you ? Nobody does. I shouldn't sing ? Excuse me... You're ugly ! Shut up, mind your business ! That's no way to sing ! After I'm a rockstar... I'll choose my man. Maybe even Gigi. - Your fly's open. - It's not. Pass me some. Close your eyes. - No spin the bottle. - Are you scared ? Okay God, if I do three baskets in a row I'll get Samantha Corduleris all to myself. Way to go! I want a man I can throw off the balcony if he bugs me, and doesn't come back questioning me. What are you saying ! What do you want ? Shut up ! No one can question me. What do they all want ? My shithead dad, what's he questioning for ? He says: "Caterina, you're 12 now, you have to earn your keep". Does he think I'm like Mandarina ? I want to be a virgin... and a singer. Look at her ! The queen ! Were you born at the Grand Hotel ? Pull this cord, you don't pay the bills. - I was just drying it. - Drying it ? Ever think of working ? Going to the beach and showing your butt in a new suit, that's what you like, right ? Go on, sing, and eat songs when you're hungry. When your hand was hot from the jerk-off, did you sing ? - Give me the keys I! - Going to work ? This is a fucking town, it's a fucking neighborhood, did I ask to be born here ? Who sings bad ? Who's a bad singer ? You called me, not even knowing it. You've made me live in this house with you, your wife and all my siblings and Mrs. Sias who craps every day at 3 a.m. You think: "What a pain when she flushes !" But it's better having windows on the square with motorcycles doing wheelies from midnight to six, than having Mrs. Sias overhead ! I like motorcycles. Actually, as soon as I'm 14 I'm getting a Norton, I'll do wheelies in the square from midnight to 6 and keep you awake. It's the same as being asleep for you, you don't get the difference. Those who say Mrs. Sias is a pain only when she flushes, has never lived at my house. You don't know what it means to live at my house. Mrs. Sias's crapping is the start of the day, even today, the 3rd of August, the day of my beloved Gigi's murdering. Like every day, Mrs. Sias wakes up and has to crap. I'll put something nice on. - Nothing to eat today I! - Coming. To get him up, she yells even twenty times, and with that fucking voice she wakes him sooner or later. Come sing with me ! But while he's holding out, the whole building on Via Corbaglius, St. Lamenera area, suburbs of Casteddu... wakes up. If she doesn't change songs, one night I'll pull a Rambo, I'll break in and kill her and that dumb husband. Leave me alone ! Look, c'mon! Coming. Coming ! - I was playing. - No you weren't ! - I was playing ! - It's a record ! Mr. Federico had been a DJ in all the discos around here and it should have been the only job in his life, if he didn't have to take the pot to his wife at 3 a.m. Because if he doesn't, she gets a backache, won't go to work and he doesn't eat. Get moving, c'mon! Angela! What's brushing your teeth got to do with this ? Will you move ? You don't want to sing, huh ? Ready ? You've grown up by now, we both have. And so ? Sing ! Are you done ? No, wait... Done. He acts dumb, but he's sneaky, he's a real lazy dog. He does this in the dark of night Just to keep from working. He's a real son-of-a-bitch. It's never chestnuts, like Mrs. Sias says. No way, you made a tree trunk! Once Mr. Federico threw without looking first and hit Tonio who was going out to watch Mrs. Nioi. If he'd found him, he'd have killed him. Tonio always finds someone to kill ! Don't you want to hear how Tonio wanted to kill Mr. Federico ? I'm doing too much cheap talk ? We don't have much time ? Right, fish ? Doesn't take much for someone to kill you. Right, fish ? Not much and you'd be killed. Sometimes I think someone up there takes us by the tail, like I'm doing with you, and decides if we live or not. But go away now, maybe I have to do something else. I don't even let my father in, you never know with him... You can come in, I'm not angry anymore. But I'll only tell what I want ! I said to come in! Hear me ? You can come in. But we'll tell only what I want. The one coming home now is my brother Massimo. He ended up in Patrick Merdonedda's gang. Like Tonio, he takes more after Dad than Mom. Quiet, you'll wake the kids ! They're already awake. What a bastard ! Quiet, Dad's awake ! - Close the door. - There isn't one. Leave some for the others. Pig. Since you woke her up, you hold her. Hi, little one. Where is your mom? What do you want ? His first fix was in the garage, together with all of Patrick's gang. But this one ends the day. Alex came home at 4:30. I know because he brushes his teeth first thing. Leave it alone, that's my stuff. If Alex sees you, he'll smash you to pieces. Nobody smashes me. I'm no bottle. No, you're a dickhead. Hi. - When did the concert start ? - At 3, Dad wanted to beat them up. Why are you still awake ? - How was yours ? - Great. - You know what ? -What ? The only reason I'm sorry I'm not a woman is because I can never play with the "Caddozas". What's that have to do with it ? Mrs. Nioi is so hot Did she come to hear you ? Feel that ? She shakes the whole house. She's got heels and soles with metal plates. At 4:50, Mrs. Sias left for her job at the market. Mr. Federico doesn't know that the rides with the butcher cost certain kinds of services. Hands off, she's my stuff, don't forget that. If he knows, he pretends he doesn't, he doesn't want to stop eating fillet steak. Good night. Good morning ! You think this is night ! Already awake ? - Move over. - What the fuck do you want ? - That's mine ! - Go get the baby. I can't. Even if you have a big dick, you're a jerk and always will be. The expert speaks ! Tonio has the biggest tool of all my brothers. He brags to everyone ! Even Mom says having it big doesn't mean having a brain. Don't cry. Be a good girl. I'll go feed your little brother and be back. Do you want it or not ? - Make him stop ! - Don't be a pain! At 5:30, Mandarina came into the room, without her usual smile. Tonio's gone out all dolled up and smelling like a tart. Want milk ? Cate, I need to sleep, will you hold him ? Then Dad woke up like every day. He says it's because he's old... Don't old people sleep ? But it's not true at all ! The truth is at 5:30 the sluts are on TV. When the slut of the day started stripping, Dad took the TV in the bathroom. At my house everyone wants the bathroom! It's the only place you can really be alone. Open up, I'll wee-wee right here I Dad, open up, I'm peeing in my pants ! My sister Luisella woke up at that exact moment. Mom, open up for me I'm peeing in my pants. Dad, please ! Open! Open up, she peed on the floor. Are you all crazy ? Going to the moon with your tool in your hand ? This is a real nuthouse. Bad day ? Careful, there's urine on the floor ! Why didn't you open for me ? Luisella, come here. Sit there. One's missing ! -No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. Dad didn't have the guts to finish his jerk-off without a door and he watched the end of the strip in the kitchen. Dad does what he damn well wants, he doesn't work, he gets disability, but he's never worked one day and he's not even disabled. Mom gets disability too, but she really is disabled and works all day in the house. In the evening she cleans two banks to earn enough to dress us decently. She treats us all equal, even if we're not all her kids. She works, not like my shithead father, who thought only about making kids. Ricciotti ! - What is it, Pa ? - Where are you going ? To Alghero. - Come back here ! - I can't, they're waiting for me. Play well and score ! Lots. Score... you at least. Last night Ricciotti dreamed he scored two goals at the summer games and his team won. And then he meets a horny old woman who takes his virginity. - Who's that ? - Ricciotti Frau. So, now his friends will stop asking. - Is Cagliari taking you ? - They might give me a tryout. Pick up the soap. We'll show you how to do it, â€˜cause you don't know. Put you hands behind your back. Leave him alone ! Are you Ricciotti ? Can I soap you up ? They're jealous. What are you looking at ? Like them ? Touch me if you want. I can see him scoring two goals... You're in fine shape ! But his virginity lost to that filthy woman ? Never! He's too shy and romantic, he'll fall in love with a model . Another girl's waiting for you. Ricciotti... I don't know if Ricciotti Frau sounds good on TV, but next year Cagliari really will try him out and take him away from home. Maybe he'll be famous like Zola or Marco Carta or Valerio Scanu, all Sardinians like us. One thing's sure: me, Ricciotti and Alex will be famous in soccer and music. Massimo and Tonio are like Dad and will end up like him. When I'm 14.1 go sing with Alex and I'll let you hear my voice... if we're still in touch ! Then you'll see if I'm stupid wanting to be a rockstar! At 6:15, Mrs. Nioi began playing the bass on the terrace, that's her only time and place for playing. Tonio and Fisino are already in the first row, all horny. Why are you here every morning in those red shirts ? We like this music. Don't you like it ? Where are you going ? Are you leaving me alone here ? Who knows this ? We're not in school ! What grades did we give you in Music ? You think I remember ? - Why don't you help him ? - I'm at home. - Where are you going ? - Leave me alone. Thanks...You did some real jerk-offs over her! What did you say ? If you can play the song again. Even if do, it almost useless. I came to hear your band once. Where ? My brother Alex says he wants to be a woman so he can play with you. C'mon, give it up! - You didn't say what it is. -What ? The song. Should I play it again ? I don't know ! I don't recognize these notes on the guitar, I'm sorry. It's not a guitar! Why are you laughing ? She's crazy I What is it, the Scooby-Doo song ? You can laugh, but one day I'm going to lay you ! Here's the other red shirt. Help him, okay ? What were you saying ? I want to lay you, the other red shirt does too. Since she kicked her last man's ass out when she caught him trying to screw Silvia, Gigi's sister... -What is it ? - It was them. Mrs. Nioi didn't want any more men, not even for fun. Tonio and Fisino think that's why she's wicked and horny and one day they'll screw her, I don't think so. See ? Gigi Nioi lives right there. I always come and wait for him to come out. Don't you want to ask me anything ? Don't be a pain, shut up ! Alex says Mrs. Nioi is sexy, because he wants to be in her band, not because he wants to â€œscunge". What does "scunge" mean ? Nothing ! Also because Alex would never cheat on his girl. He's been with Simonetta for three years I Wait a second, stay here. I don't want to be here alone with them ! I said to stay there I Hi. Alex, Simonetta's mother is looking for you. Simonetta is shy, pretty and a virgin and she believes in God like me, Alex and Ricciotti, and like Mom and like Luisella too, who doesn't seem to take after Dad. - Come here. - I have to go. Just two seconds. She might let Alex rub her up, but she doesn't touch him. Even if Alex brags a lot, he's right to wait for her, Simonetta's the best in this neighborhood, besides Luna and me. What a pain, you're like a tick. - You didn't say Alex was here. - It's none of your business. Look, my brothers want me around. What are you doing here ? Nothing. - I'm going to the field. - Me too, with Luna. - Does she have to come too ? -Why ? The field's no nursery. - Caterina wants you, you know ? -What ? Is that Samantha ? What do you want ? I can't now. - I'm off. - Weren't you going to the field ? Later. Simonetta is a true virgin, like me, not like Samantha from the ground floor. She's a virgin, but took it in the ass from Tonio and Fisino. Those two pal around like twins. Mom says, alone, they cant even Zip up their pants. What are you doing ? People can see you ! - Come here ! - What do you want to do ? You'll see. What are you doing ? Where are you going ? Hi. Tonio and Fisino told about how they convinced Samantha. The whole report, minute-by-minute, word-for-word, scream-by-scream, spread around fast. Can't you see she's all wet ? Help take her top off. I'd even tell you how it went, but the story's too dirty. Since then, whoever goes to Samantha and says... - Hi. - Hi, what is it ? Jonathan said if you won't give him a "coot"... If I don't ? He said... he'll tell your dad what you did with Tonio and Fisino. Tell him to come to me if he wants something. Why did they send you ? He said he'll tell your father everything. Tell him [ I'll wait for him at the bus. What's a coot anyway ? Its a. - What ? - A bird, didn't you know ? No. What did she say ? You have to ask her yourself. - Nothing else ? - She'll wait by the bus. He's in for me. She's busy, what the fuck do you want ? - What are you doing here ? - I didn't feel like playing. You'd better get lost. -Why ? - Because. If not, cover your ears. Wait I - Ricciotti ! -What is it ? Wait. Were you looking for me ? - What are you doing here ? - Playing ball. I don't know if Dad starting liking him because he saw him there or because Ricciotti saw him. Everybody on his team all went to Samantha, with the excuse of Tonio and Fisino. He didn't want them to say anything more to him or have them think, like Dad, he was a pansy. Who was that guy earlier ? The one in the Milan shirt. - Jonathan I! - Jonathan's his name ? Nice faggy name. Ricciotti, tell me something. You're not a fag, are you ? What are you saying ! - You're sure ? - Yes. I can believe Dad went to that bus, but not Ricciotti. Ricciotti no. He isn't like Tonio and Massimo, he didn't take after Dad. Sometimes he says it just to brag with his friends and because he's embarrassed. But I know he's a virgin like me and like Luisella. He's not like Samantha. To go on about me: like always Mrs. Sias got home at 7 and Luisella ran in the kitchen to Mom. - Who decides ? - The cafeteria. Is your company called "The Shine Back" ? Yes. If I work with you, will I get a bag of cereal too ? - Sure. -So, can? Eat now. What a dumb face ! Why did you turn it off ? Because they think Sardinians are just from Nuoro. What about Iglesias and Cagliari ? They're mine ! They told me you wet your pants. So? Cut it out. I will if you do ! Mom, can I have money for the beach ? Ask your father. At 7.07 Tonio came back and the big mess started again. Tell your blind freak boyfriend if I see him tonight, I'll kill him. - What's his fucking name ? - Where were you, dressed like that ? I've been back and out again. What is it ? - Are you eating ? - No. - He's in love with Mrs. Nioi. - Go tell him I'll kill him. No one screws a girl from the Frau house. He ratted to his mother that we beat him up. If you hadn't, do you think his mother would want you ? Her blind kid isn't going to fuck a Frau either, got it ? I'll kill him I - What's all the racket for I - Ask your son. Where are you going in this faggy shirt ? I've already come and gone out. Wake up ! Don't screw me around ! Nobody knows a fucking thing here. Mom, I've had no sleep, will you take him ? Hear that ? She's had no sleep... the little hooker. - Be quiet ! - You're just the same. Who set the example ? Remember to give your daughter money for the bus. Where are you going ? To the beach, can I have the bus money ? The queen ! Were you born at the Grand Hotel ? I was just drying it ! - Pull that cord ! - was drying it ! Ever think about working ? You like going to the beach and showing your butt in a new suit ! Go on, sing, and eat songs when you're hungry. - Give me the keys I! - Going to work ? - Get lost, you'll get nothing ! - Shove â€˜em up your ass ! This is a fucking town, it's a fucking neighborhood did I ask to be born here ? It's all your fault I argued with Dad, hear me ? And Gigi isn't blind, he's just a little short-sighted. It's useless to pretend you're sleeping. Don't be a pain in the butt, okay ? Get lost or I'll hit you. You won't touch Gigi anyway. Hear me ? You won't touch Gigi ! What the fuck's he doing in my bed ? Tonio, move ? Cate, will you hold her ? I'm going to the beach. You're putting that over your suit ? Yes, I don't care if the wind lifts it, I'm in my suit. That's not why I said it. Why don't you try the pink one ? I won't hold her, I'm going to the beach with Luna. - Just a little, so I can sleep. - No. Are you on the make today ? Is Gigi Nioi coming too ? Mind your business ! Here, take this. I still won't hold the baby. C'mon! The white dress from when she was 14 just fits me, like the Speedo. We're made just alike. I have to go to the beach ! If I don't do her work, at 20 I'll be prettier than her. That kind of work ages you, even though she's still pretty as an angel. At 7:40 I left the house and sitting on the steps was Luna Cotzas, my best friend. Luna and me are really alike. - Do you have a towel for me ? - It's in my bag. We were born three days apart, same month, same year and same building, at 47 A and 47 C. Once, Luna said my father banged her mother three days after mine. It's probable. What's she want ? Luna, where are you going dressed like that ? - To the beach. - You didn't tell me. - Will you take us ? - I'm not off to play ! Tell your father when he wakes up, I won't be back for lunch, bye. Fuck off! Luna's mother cleans houses to earn some extra, because her husband doesn't work, like my dad. But Mrs. Cotzas must have a taste for extras if she did it with Dad. He says he used to be as handsome as Robert De Niro. Mom says it's not true. He's always been ugly and lazy, just like Luna's dad. Luna and I are like sisters. -What is it ? - Nothing. More than sisters. Let's get off here ? - Did you see that guy ? -Who ? That guy ! He's putting on a show for me. Careful, you risk ! Look, you could break your back. Shut up! [told you ! Caterina I Didn't you see who's there ? He probably got on to rub up against some woman's butt. Like that guy today, he couldn't keep his eyes off you. I loved seeing him make no hit all morning. - Should we go this way ? - Let's try. How embarrassing ! - Caught! -No! Then let's go this way. Sure, who cares I! - Excuse me, can we sit here ? - Sure. When we arrived, at 9, there were just mothers with children. No males, because they wake up late. Are you here alone ? Yes. Luna and I usually play cards at the beach and we don't talk to boys. Boys don't even bother with us, they're looking for boobs but Luna and I haven't got them yet. Even if Alex says I have two beautiful buds. I know he says it because he loves me, but there's nothing to see or hide. I the Olympic swimsuit, it's like a warrior's armor and when I'm hyped up, I swim better in a Speedo. When I swim I forget home, neighborhood, future, my dad, the world. I forget everything. I should have been born a fish. I like darting under the surface, coming up just to breathe and look at the sun. I like to feel my feet spreading like hands to push me. And when the sea's smooth like today, I like to hear the sound of my breathing. Wait for me, little guy, I'm coming. Little guy! Wait. Luna, look what I found ! - What's that ? - A cat! Let it go, come and help me. Look! C'mon hurry ! - Let that cat go and come here I - I'm coming. C'mon, little guy, now I'll let you go. Come and help me ! Wow, what style ! Luna swims just like me. No one from St. Lamenera swims the crawl. We're a little rough. - Cold ? - Pretty much. Why didn't you wait for me ? I didn't feel like it. Tonio swore to me this morning that he's going to kill Gigi. Stop Tonio. Accuse him. He's still my brother. Then warn Gigi to hide. He'll get overt! Mrs. Nioi doesn't even see a hick like Tonio, he's too dumb I! - You know who looks at him a lot ? -Who ? Ele Curreli. If Tonio notices Ele, he'll forget Mrs. Nioi. Yes, but I don't understand. How could Ele want a guy like Tonio ? She's pretty, she's got a job, what's he got ? She must have heard about his tool. Stop it! I guess she wants something big. Let's go? We thought the same thing at the same time. That's why I like Luna, we never have different wishes. It's so cold! It must be late ! - My mother will kill me. - Forget her! I can't! Excuse me, what time is it ? 2:15. You had a nice swim ! We didn't have a watch. Come in the shade if you like... No, thank you, we'll get some sun. Didn't you tell your mom ? No. What's that guy want ? He's looking at us. - He's looking at us ? - I don't know. Maybe he's watching the lady, her boob is out. He wants some ! - Would you help me please ? - Sure. - Would you hold her ? - Can I pack your things ? Sorry, you can't leave your things here. Okay, next time. Now what ? You can stay, if you like. - Can we take a shower ? - Of course. I'll give you a ride if you like. - Are you cold ? - Very! Jeeze, he looks like Gigi. That's true, even has the same ball. Look who's here. The show's over and now he's going home. - You say they don't look at us ! - No, he was looking at the lady ! At 2:10 we got in the car with the lady with the big boobs. When I pull my tit out, there's always someone watching. But it was starting to bother me. Maybe he was looking at you ? No, at you. In Via Poetto she started going 200, passing everyone. At 150, we seemed like snails. Ma'am, the baby ! He's not afraid ! Relax, little guy. - They're following us. -Who ? The guy from the beach. He following us ! He's wearing a red shirt like my brothers. But he's older and uglier. Now we'll screw him. You're not scared, right ? You girls aren't scared, are you ? Luna looked terrified at me. Ma'am, we're not afraid of him, you can slow down. My name's Carla. Where are you going ? I don't know. Where should we go ? Leave us in Republic Square. Okay, leave us in Republic Square. We got dropped off far from home. For the first time I didn't want to show where I lived. Now he's scared, you can't call that tailing ! Gosh, that woman's crazy ! Now they'll find that baby... smashed against the windshield, like a milkshake. With Carla ! Let's get an ice cream ? I'm the biggest ice cream eater in the world, I could eat a truckload, so... just imagine my reply. How do you want it ? If they 'll give it to us ! Excuse me ? Excuse me ? He must think we don't have money. Could you come a moment ? What a bastard ! Move ! - What flavors ? - Cream, vanilla and chocolate. One flavor 1 euro, three flavors 3 euro. That's 6 euro. - Do we split it ? - Mandarina's paying today. Bye. Bye, three-flavors-3-euro ! Maybe he was nice ! Who, three-flavors-3-euro ? Mandarina said when she moves to Mulino Becciu, I can live with her. How can she ? Like that. - Look who's here ! - Don't pay any attention. Let's sit on the bench. - No one's around ! - C'mon, sit down ! He must have knocked off the lady. Think he ate the baby too ? No, he's already a milkshake ! C'mon, I was kidding ! Hi. His voice is like a cat in heat. Ten euro each if you lick the ice cream I give you. Thirty euro or nothing. Okay. Give me the money. Who'll start ? Pull it out. Here ? No one's around. You can say you got it sucked right in front of the Justice Building. Hold this. You're sure ? Well then, open your fly. Whore I Run! Run, you can eat that fucking ice cream later ! My ice cream melted a little because we ran like crazy. In one second, the wind took us to Mount Urpinu. He's probably still sticking the piece back on. Better if he changes it ! It's sure not like Tonio's ! When we talk like that, we sound like hookers. Are you sweet on Tonio ? What are you saying ? All I say is nature wasn't lazy with Tonio. And even if he screwed the piece back on... Let me talk ! Even if he screwed it back... I don't think he'd follow us this far. But he followed us from the beach. Is someone there ? Is today Sunday ? For the bride ? You don't get married just on Sunday in Cagliari. We're not in your grandma's town. Any desire to get married would go in this heat. After I'm a singer I'll marry Gigi. I'll never get married, I don't want to be like Mom and Dad. It's the first time we haven't thought alike. And with the horny guy's 30 euro ? We'll splurge on ice cream for a week. Right. There's not even one cloud. Listen... I have to tell Gigi. What are they doing ? Aren't they the ones from before ? What are you doing ? Crabit! Getup! - Do we keep this ? - No, give it back ! Were you making a film ? Thank you. We went down the hill holding hands. We talked about things like what you've already heard but maybe aren't interested in. Why not let me laugh too ? You make people laugh just looking at you, no help needed. Come on, move ! - Get off in front I - Hear that ? Pretty brazen for such little girls ! Look in the mirror, then tell me why you were born. Should I go up ? If not, why did we come ? Come with me ? - What will you tell him ? - I don't know. What do I do ? Ring. You're not bashful, are you ? You ring. When you're a singer. It doesn't ring. Ring with your hand. Hi. - What's wrong ? - Nothing, so-so. Did my brother do it ? Did he hit you ? No, not this time. - What's the matter with him ? - I don't know. Why don't you tell the truth ? They're your friends more than that roach. - Ask them in. - Who's the roach ? - Let's go. - He has to tell me ! I'll tell you because you're my friends, come in! This way. Why does he have that stupid groggy face ? I'd say your brother's right. - May we ? - Come in. Okay... here's the thing... I asked Samantha Courduleris to go steady and this is her answer. She says she won't go with me because I'm too young. -Let me read ! - No, it's my business. She also said... she wants to stay a virgin until she gets married. Why don't you go to the field tonight and see Samantha's sport. She might even say yes. - What ? She'll say yes ? - Sure! She'll say yes ? But say: "If you don't give me a jerk-off, Caterina, Tonio's sister, will tell your dad everything". What ? I don't understand ! If she doesn't jerk you off, she'll tell her dad everything. - I have to go to the field ? - He's really thick ! He's a bastard and I wanted to marry him ! Shouldn't we have told him Tonio wants to shoot him ? I don't care. Too bad for him. Let's get an ice cream ? A 4:45 we got on bus 47. We didn't say a word. Faces blank, we stared straight ahead, without seeing. Where do we go ? We got off at the bus station and took the 19. Silent and blank like on bus 47, we got off at St. Gilla. At the ice cream shop, we got cream, vanilla and chocolate. And then again on bus 10, all the way to the bulwark. A 6:30 we got another ice cream, cream, vanilla and chocolate. Licking our cones, we started down Via Manno. You know, I'm a little worried, traitor or not, it's not right to die at 13. I feel like a rat and a piece of shit for not telling him, even if he was a real bastard with me. I don't want to be like her. If have to sing here in Cagliari, I'll sing in the center, on New Year's Day, at least I'll be on TV. At a certain point Luna got fed up with the silence. I'm going to run without looking. Cate, I'm not looking ! What are you doing ? Before she started, she'd already decided where she was going. I'm not looking ! What are you doing, you idiot ! -Run! - Idiots ! I like Luna, she always knows how to deal with me. Maybe he's dumb, but I have to tell him. Let's go to Gigi's ? Okay. We got off at Buoncammino, at 7:00 we caught bus 1 and stopped talking. At 7:30 we got off at the bus station and took number 47. At 7:55 we got home. You'll say: "Couldn't you walk a hundred meters, avoid the bus and get home an hour earlier ?" Maybe I had to cool down before going to Gigi's. I can't let that roach steal him. What ? I can't let that roach steal him. We have to get off. No answer. Maybe no one's home. It's all closed up, no one's home. Let's try near the basketballs. But if my mother sees me, she'll make me go in. Look who's here ! - Where are you going ? - Come here a second. - Could you go home ? - No. - One second ! - No. - Take my bag. - Leave me alone ! - Can I come with you ? - We'll be right back. - C'mon'! - We'll be right back. - Can I come with you ? -I said no ! Go away ! See ? He's not here. We'd better hurry. What's this guy want ? Let's go to the field ? Where did you want to go ? We've never come this way. There aren't any games at the field now. Patrick, you can't pick us up. The little fairy sees everything blue ! - Because it's dark. - Nice reply, partner. - I'm not your partner. - In fact I didn't mean you. Patrick, go away, I'm calling my father. â€œ I'll call my father..." Massimo, did you hear your sister ? - Patrick, leave her alone ! - Massimo, why are you here ? What would your father say, seeing your brother in that state ? You're such a bastard ! Bastard... Why use these words ? I'll call my brother Tonio ! There are people here ! - There's no one. - That's not true. - Come on. -Let go of me! - Can't you see there's no one ? - Someone's here. Walk more quietly. Is that them ? See he understood, he's not stupid. Good for him, but I'm not going to warn him. Let goof me! I don't want to see or hear him anymore, cancelled ! You won't lose a thing. - Wait I - Let me cool down ! Okay, but wait. - What are you doing here ? - Did you see Massimo ? - Massimo who ? - Our Massimo. No, go home. It's no time to hang around here. You too, Luna, go home ! Do you think my father got a hand-job from the roach too ? If you still want Gigi in your life, you'd better hope your father took his place. What a shitty life ! Who sent these guys ? I thought all those tears and moping was strange. If you stayed with Gigi, you'd forget to be a singer, you'd become like these kids, like that roach Samantha. You're getting boobs I! Really, they weren't like that this morning. Stop, you're embarrassing me. Luna's right. We went back to the building entrance, because, if it happens, it 'll be on the steps near the basketballs. You can't avoid the steps and Tonio is too embarrassed with Mrs. Nioi, he'd never kill her son inside her house and I don't know if I'd want to stop him. What do you want ? Where are you going with that gun ? Want to hurt someone ? I don't give a shit I If you touch him, I'll accuse you even if you're my brother. I don't give a fucking damn ! Gigi's coming back. Right then we heard the sound of lots of motorbikes. They went by like angels: Malcom, Giulietto, Chicchu and Bobboi. All Tonio's friends. - Why did he flatten out ? - Because he's scared to death. But they didn't even notice him ! Why doesn't he leave ? He doesn't know he wants to kill him, only that he hates him. Maybe he just wants to scare him. Gigi stayed stuck to the wall like chewing gum. Jesus must have heard me, He always hears when you call for the Virgin. Stop here ! Stop, damn it ! Stop ! He heard me and looked down on the muddle of the world, all the way to Sirboni square and our building. He saw Tonio with the gun sitting on the steps and Gigi glued against the wall like a stamp. And He decided to intervene. And since Jesus isn't lazy like my father, He did His duty as soon as I said "Holy Mary I", a beautiful woman appeared near the basketballs. I read the past, present and future, of men, women, children and animals. Donations welcome. Come and see, come and hear. Aleni, the fortune teller who reads the future of the world. Donations welcome. Come and see ! Come forward I! Give me your hand. Your hand, please. You're a lucky woman, another man would have already killed you. You'll be even luckier, you'll find what you're looking for, but haven't found yet. Darling ! Where are you from ? Come to Aleni! Look, he's beautiful. Luna and I were dazed watching the show. Gigi was safe while the fortune teller was there. Where did she come from ? The cat's bigger than she is. It looks like the one at the sea. - I didn't see it very well. - You made me throw it away ! Is it yours ? Tell me! Let's go! Didn't you find it today ? Sorry. If it's not yours, I'll let it go. She's so strange ! Your hand, please. He's still there ? Why doesn't he go ? As long as he stays there, he's safe. Tonio won't touch him, with all these people here. You're pursued by a great misfortune, but you asked for it. It's thanks to this misfortune that you're alive today. You'll find a treasure, but you'll lose it. - What's funny ? - Your hand, please. We're surrounded, like Gigi. Your father's here. The roach's time's over too. You can tell by Dad's face when he's had a jerk-off, he wants to socialize instead of going home to Mom. Doesn't that dumbbell realize Dad got a hand-job too ? You've never done anything... Just a minute ! Go get an ice cream. It's not the time for ice cream ! You always have something to say. What's all this crowd ? Here's the daughter who loves me, kiss your dad ! You're embarrassing, we've grown ! - Where are the babies ? - With Mom. Let me go, it's my turn. In 20 years you won't even remember you sank so low. If they tell you about it, you'll think they're lying. What the fortune teller told Mandarina sounds good. She's still young and beautiful. Look at your sweetheart. You're right to say he's thick. He's thick like you. You're such a bitch ! No one loves you where you are, and they're right. Where you're going you won't be either loved or hated, that's better. Miss I C'mon ! Nice things, okay ? You deserve a lot, suffering for an idiot and you'll get more than you deserve when he dies. Oh, my God! - Where's the cat ? - I gave it to the kid at the wall. You're Gigi. Yes. Where's Caterina ? This is Samantha. Who knows what she's telling him. That witch scares me. Go stand by the wall and don't move ! Go and stay back. What more do you want to see ? - What's wrong ? - Nothing. - Tell me! - Nothing's wrong, don't be a pain ! Fuck off! You've been like this for a while, tell me what's wrong. I'm jealous of Gigi and Samantha, what a pain ! Luna, come here. I can't right now. You didn't tell me the truth either, did you ? - What truth, you loafer ? - Luna, tell your mother! Let's go, I don't want to see them fight. Who's the deadbeat ? You, you ugly failure ! Get out of my way or... Want to hit your wife ? Aren't you ashamed ? Hands off, mind your own business ! Hands off, you bag of shit ! For the first time, Dad acted like a gentleman. If, at school, we have to write an essay "describe your father"... Let's take Dad away before he starts a ruckus. I'm busy right now ! I was saying... I'll finally write something. I can't say that at 5 a.m. he starts... Excuse me, but it's not true Cate and I think alike. What do you want ? You're an idiot ! We don't. I'd never have written that about my father. She's always mad at her father, always ! But I can't hate hers either. Look, you're the cuckold, because Luna's my daughter, hear me ? Sorry brother, but Luna's my thing. Luna says I talk too much, but she should take it out on Dad. Those words hit like a brick, but she's always cared for him. I'll see to you when you get home. She said Dad banged her mother three days after mine. - He scares me like that. - You should have been scared before. Wait I At 10:20, Dad went home, he packed, put on pants and his blue jacket. What do I do now ? What do you want ? - Tell Mom I won't be back. - Do what you like. He came down with a suitcase, his porn magazines under his arm and they walked off haughtily in front of everyone. - Can I go with Cate ? - Yeah! The fortune teller was right, Dad left, but I'm afraid it's not true. Happy ? I don't know, are you ? We're sisters. Since Dad's gone, you could come and live at my house, okay ? Alright. - Want a hand ? - No, or he'll change his mind. - What do we do ? Can we go ? - Not now. - Are you scared ? - Yes. -Let's go! -No! I know I already told you, but like Luna because she never wastes time deciding. - Let's go to your house ? - What did Dad say ? Nothing ! They were sitting in the kitchen. They were talking and drinking, like two friends ! And your mom ? Nothing... She said I can stay at your house just for the night, not more. I think she still doesn't realize I've left. If yesterday they'd told me that Dad would be gone, I wouldn't have believed it. Good evening. I'd be afraid if I were him. He must have gone to get his wife before she sings. You know what the fortune teller told him ? He'll find a treasure but he won't enjoy it. And she told his wife she'll have more than she deserves when he dies. Who knows if it's true ? What's he want ? Angela! -What is it ? - It's late, let's go ? - Can't you see I'm busy ? - There's nothing here. It's late ! I'm coming, leave me alone ! You're nuts ! - Nuts ! -Me? Idiot ! Get lost, you slacker ! Got alight ? Where did he go ? I don't know, I wasn't looking at him. What were you looking at ? A guy. - He's not going to shoot him ? -Who ? Gigi. Maybe they're waiting for us to buy a ticket. An open-air movie today ! I looked at the moon, it was shining like a kind of smile, like saying to me: don't worry, Cate, you prayed and we heard you, the Holy Virgin told me everything. Having seen the fortune teller, I could even believe the moon's smile told the truth, but I was scared anyway. At 10:40, Gigi and Samantha started walking hand in hand. When Tonio saw him, he aimed his gun and a big mess started. He really wants to shoot him ? The gray car crashed into the wall. And nothing happened to Gigi. Everybody back ! Get back ! - Let's go? - Wait, I want to see something. Go! - They're sending us away ? - I want to see something ! Go! Back up, go! Let's go, come away I! Quiet. They told me to stay here ! Right ? Start off, I can't come. My husband called me, can I go to him a moment ? Stay seated, I'll say when you can move I! You didn't see a thing ! I'm leaving, goodbye, goodnight, that's the way it goes. Did you see that bitch ? Isn't she ashamed to go with your brother ? Who's he talking to ? Angela! Mr. Federico, what's wrong ? Put your hand to his mouth. Can't feel anything. - Mr. Federico, it's Caterina ! - He collapsed. - What happened ? - He collapsed. No way he collapsed ! Wake up, you sluggard ! What's this ? Let's see... Let's go! Where are you going, Tonio ? Sluggard, the fortune teller told you ! - Is this man with you ? - No. - Relatives ? - No, but he lives in this building. What did you see ? Nothing, we were looking at the moon, we heard lots of noise and we saw Mr. Federico fall. What did you see ? Nothing, I was just standing, I heard lots of noise, like a pressure cooker exploding and going... Then I saw you. Did you shoot ? It wasn't a pressure cooker noise, it was more like a watermelon noise. Like when you throw a watermelon from the third floor and it smashes ? - Send them home ! - Go home girls, it's late. - On your orders. -On my orders ! Really, it was a pressure cooker noise. He's really dead. Get back ! Where's his wife ? Isn't she coming down ? We obeyed orders and went home. We told Mom everything, that no one from Mrs. Sias's house even leaned out. Really... That sucks ! Did Tonio really go to Mrs. Sias's ? And when she craps ? You'll see, I mean, you'll hear! Luna, Cate, it's on the table. I can't right now, we're brushing our teeth. Is this any time to brush your teeth ? I can't. And I don't think Tonio will stay with that old woman. When the money runs out, he'll leave. I can't imagine Tonio taking the pot to her! Don't make me laugh ! We all were happy to have Luna. Mom did bow-tie pasta with tomato and mint sauce for her. She makes it only when she's happy. I thought Massimo would sleep in a room with Tonio from now on. Who'll tell Massimo when he gets in ? If he can understand... Caterina, be quiet. You didn't see the state he was in! You also sleep with Tonio, so you'll be alone too. Sure, because then they'll come to me, when I buy a house in Mulino Becciu. The house in Mulino Becciu... In Mulino Becciu... We laughed and joked ill late and nobody mentioned Dad. After dinner, Luna and I got into my bed. Mom gave us a clean sheet and we hugged like the good sisters we are. - Know something ? -What ? - I saved Gigi. - How ? With God ! He sent the fortune teller. The religion teacher said God doesn't like fortune tellers. -Why ? - Because they read your mind. Not true ! He read my mind too, and sent Dad and Tonio away. Then He had the police come. But who did the shooting ? I don't know, but if it weren't for the police, Gigi wouldn't be here. But did God really have to save a piece of shit like Gigi ? With all the people there are ! They say God is everywhere. I don't believe it. -What is it ? - I want to kiss you. Me too. But with light lips. Our lips feel like butterflies. So do we. Pretty butterflies. Who knows what time Gigi and Samantha managed to cross the street, hand in hand.
