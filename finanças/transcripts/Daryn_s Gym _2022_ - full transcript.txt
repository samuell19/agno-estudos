Hi, I'm Daryn. Daryn JNR. And I'm the owner and general manager here at Miller & Sons Gym, in Johannesburg. I know I don't look like your, like your regular gym owner, but that's kind of our USP. We might be small, but we've got something for everybody. A killer weight section. Treadmills and bike machines and a coffee shop with a smoothie bar for all your health needs. I truly believe that you are what you eat, which is why everything here is responsibly sourced, organic and sugar free. I mean, sugar is basically nature's cocaine. At least with the real shit, you lose weight. There's a fat attack support group run by my sister, Bianca. Only three things in life will tell you the truth, children, drunks, and yoga pants. And I'm a combination of all of them. I'm disappointed in you. Next. Where most gyms are these impersonal sausage factories, I like to make things a little bit more friendlier, more personalised. A homemade protein ball on your bench for when you get here. Pre-workout in our water fountain. And then we have trainers who create a workout designed perfectly for you. So flexible. I'm committed to each of my clients body journeys, just as much as I'm committed to my personal Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. I send them pictures from my daily workouts, along with motivation from the Bible, making sure that their spirits have as much gains as their abs. Jesus is like my main guy. I mean, beyond being the saviour of humanity and God's son, his muscle to fat ratio in those old renaissance paintings, is inspirational. Hashtag goals. And my personal favourite, a pet section for all our fitness animals who don't want to leave their pets at home. It's run by Richard. He's almost finished with high school and he makes sure that everyone is taken care of there. I hate animals. The only reason I am here is because I got caught smoking dope by my principal. This is part of my community service. 8 weeks of this before I can join my boys on the coast for matric holiday. That's if I don't get tetinus from all the rusty equipment they have here. I even help the guys with their Vitamin D injections when they need me to. We're basically the nice guys of the gym industry, you know. "Kill-Them-With-Kindness" kind of vibes. We have a lady coming in this afternoon who might teach yoga. Have a seat. So, if you could be any piece of gym equipment, which one would you be and why? She approached me, personally, to ask me if I needed a yoga instructor and being a kind of guy who likes to think out of the box, I told her to come on in. She's very pretty. Anyway. The area's gone through a bit of a boom since the hipsters moved into Linden. There's a steakhouse, a sex shop, and there's this new building going up across the road that's got us all excited. Nobody knows what it is, but Bianca says she heard it's a school for the blind. I'm not here to fuck around. I started as a personal trainer in Starz Fitness in Cape Town about 4 years ago and now I run the most successful branch in the country. But it's easy to rise through the ranks when your competition is a bunch of skinny bitches from Seapoint who close shop at 3:00 PM. Fucking Capetonians and their 'work/life' balance. They say you ain't shit until you've made it in Jozi and my dream is to make Starz, the leading fitness brand in the country. And that's why I'm here. Starz is opening its flagship store and they want me to spearhead it. Building is underway and we should be opening shop in the new year just in time for the Resolution Crowd. That's what we in the industry call all the people who sign their gym contracts in the first week of January. Nothing says welcome in to the New Year like a gym full of fat people. Speaking of fat, all these business ideas and a very long winter, haven't been exactly kind to my own waistline. Thank God for Photoshop and fat burners. Abs. That's beautiful and just smooth out the skin. Perfect. There's just a little snag to the vision board. And that's the fact that the property isn't big enough to accommodate all the things I'd like to have but as luck would have it, there's a private gym across the road that looks like it's going under. We made an offer on the space to the previous owner, but that was declined. Fortunately, he passed away a couple of months ago and we hope whoever runs it now will be a little bit more accommodating. My grandfather, Daryn SNR. He owned the gym back in the sixties. It was just called Miller's Gym. Before he passed he handed it over to my dad. They decided to call it Miller & Sons. They thought it sounded fancier. That's my mom Starla, when she used to be a fitness model. She comes in every day just to, just to visit. Darren was like, well he was like a surprise. Because, you see, his father and I had given up all hopes of conceiving. He had taken this faulty batch of steroids and it had made him sterile and... Ja no, everyone now would clutch their pearls if they hear that story but back in the eighties we were all on it. All of us. But you know what? It just took like a couple of bottles of wine and a hot night in Umhlanga to kick start things, and nine months later, then, there was Daza. When my dad passed away last year. I came back from overseas to help run things, you know. It being a family business and all. I used to work on the cruise ships. I used to help run the kiddies play area. This was very exciting. It was a lot of fun. My favourite though is this. He looks scared but he was actually having a great time. That's me. In the bunny outfit. Look, it's not been easy. Prices keep on going up and membership keeps on going down. Everybody wants to be a part of one of those fancy gyms for the points or to lower their insurance costs. But at least we own the building, but being half a bar in debt has really forced me to focus and think about other ways of bringing in cash. We run a car wash from our parking lot, R200 for a premium wash and R150 if you're a member. I drive a taxi over the weekends. Sorry. I even did a massage course, which seems to be really popular with some of the members. Really popular. Anyway, I have a pretty good team and we all do our best. Even in these tough times, life can still be beautiful. I love these guys. Another way that I'm saving on cash is by sleeping at the gym. And it's really not that bad. There's no traffic to get to work. I'm able to use the equipment without waiting in line, and the treadmill is really comfortable to sleep on. I call it my 'bedmill'. It only fits one person, so I don't know what I'm going to do when I get a girlfriend, but for now it's perfect. If we can just make it through to December then we'll be fine. Just till December. Before we climb into the admin, I'd like to welcome a new face at the Miller & Sons family. This is Zintle, everybody. She's our new yoga instructor or 'Yogi', as they say. Thank you, Daryn. Hi, everyone. Hi, Zintle. We've decided to lean into some more alternative fitness methods just to bring in some new clients. Zintle is trained in... Ashtanga. Ashtanga yoga, and we will be giving classes in the mornings and the evenings. This is Jackson. He's our head of personal training and social media. Great to meet you. If you're tired of that light stretching, maybe you should join one of my training programs. It's a workout. Okay. If you promise to finish one of my classes. Deal. Hashtag Miller time. Hashtag ripped. Hashtag your body is a temple. Wow. I promise he speaks in full sentences. He has a degree in Kinesiology. Don't let the hashtags and muscles fool you. Truthfully, I think yoga's from the devil. It's a way for demons to enter you but God didn't give me a spirit of fear so I'll do the class. I'll just be praying in tongues as they do their meditation stuff. Putting on a full armor of God. That's my sister Bianca. She's the head of reception and runs the Fat Attack support group. Welcome to the shit show. And that's Jacques he runs our smoothie bar and he also makes the best coffees this side of Linden. Namaste. Namaste. Okay, okay. That's enough. 1 meter, 1 meter, remember what I told you. I have a bit of a reputation for guiding people on their journeys to sexual enlightenment. I studied tantric bodyworks at Mount Kailash in India and I was ordained to bring this knowledge back to South Africa. Men, women, I don't care. A hole is a hole, As long as they leave my space having had a multi-orgasmic experience then I'm happy. I especially love introducing straight boys to their prostates. That's it bro, that's it. They always squirm in the beginning but when they surrender to it... man. It's like a bomb went off at the yoghurt factory. I just have like a little question. We don't actually have a yoga studio so where exactly will you be doing... The MMA section. We can throw down some bamboo mats, light some candles and set the mood. Okay. Has anybody seen Richard? I'm here, but there is something outside you might want to see. This is bad, really bad. Like not good. But we'll be fine. We're just going to do what we always do, our best and be kind. Seriously? Yes, seriously. I'm just going over there to be a good neighbour. There's more than enough clients for us all to share. Maybe we can even partner on some things. Okay. Maybe, maybe take it easy on the protein balls. You don't want to intimidate them. Those things are toxic. I had the shits for five days after I made the mistake of having one. Tsek, man. Tsek Disgusting things. Sorry about that, he's feral. That's a lovey name. Anyway, some asshole in the area keeps on feeding them and they won't stop breeding and I want them all removed before our grand opening. Where are my manners. My name is Funeka. Funi. I'm Daryn. Hi. Are you the lady from the banner? Yes. So what brings you to my front door Daryn? I'm the owner of Miller & Sons. The gym across the road. That sweet spot. I'm so sorry. Sorry for? For what's about to happen to you. I don't understand. Let's stop playing games here, Daryn. You guys are fucked. No we're not. So what brings you here? And please don't tell me some bullshit story about trying to be a good neighbour. Wow. That's exactly why you're here. I'm going to destroy you and your shitty little gym. And if I were you I'd cut all my losses and put that building up for sale. Have a good day now. What the fuck is in these things. Hi. How did it go? That's great, that's great. Yeah, so I just met the owner. Um, to say he was a pussy would be an insult to my vagina. Yah. Perfect. Okay, so now that the gym has got a face, I want to destroy it even more. Okay good, sharp. Remember how I said I'd let nothing stand in my way? I knew exactly who he was when I heard the 'doff doff' of his Hobbit feet stamping towards me. I've had my eye on that property since we started building ours. That's why I asked my little sister to start working there, to get the lay of the land and take them down from the inside. I 'Trojan-Horsed' those mother fuckers. My sister. Funi has always been intense. You know, I think we have very different views on what it means to succeed. All I really want out of life is a cute little yoga studio with a vegan cafe, space for my cats and maybe a good guy to call home, you know? But my way of doing things has landed me with credit card debt and student loans to the roof that only Funi can help me out with, at a price of course. It's always at a price. But she wants to turn the Miller & Sons gym into wellness center and she says that once that's all set up, I can manage that. So, that should be really cool. Sorry, it's the wind and stuff. Okay there? I'm fine. It's that gym over there. When they go up they're going to destroy us. So what are you going to do about it? There's nothing I can do. I've already been over there. Trying to be a good neighbour. See if we could partner on stuff, but the new owner she's small but she's intense. Why don't you fight back? I can't. They're bigger, smarter, faster, newer. You know, that never stopped your father. What's that? Sometimes David ends up being Goliath's bitch for twenty years before he gets another chance to throw a stone at him. Don't miss your moment to fight for what you love. He's a good kid. Peacemaker, not a fighter. He reminds me of myself sometimes actually. In another reality he could have actually been my boy if I'd just had the guts to... make a move with Starla. I trained with Daryn SNR, but he was always the top dog. But that ship has sailed hey, long ago. Your eyes are closed. You're focusing on your brow point. Making this your last cycle, inhaling through both your nostrils, and as you exhale, lowering yourself onto your back for Shavasana, your feet are hip distance apart, your hands are lying next to you, palms facing up, relaxing your whole body. Are you okay there? Yeah, I am well, I'm just taking in the full experience. Okay, take your time. This 'light stretching' can be a bit disorientating. Attention all staff. Please make your way to the meeting area in 15 minutes. Thank you. Okay. So here's the deal. As hard as it is for me to say this we're in trouble. We're over R600,000 in debt and unless we find a way to make membership go up I'm going to have to sell the gym. That's why I called you all here today. We're a team and I need your help. Any ideas guys? What about um, a tantric workshop? A weekend thing where we, we serve vegan meals and then we work our way through the Kama Sutra. Okay, I know you think that the world's problems can be solved with chia seeds and anal beads, but I think we need a solution that doesn't require the gym needing a deep cleanse afterwards. Suit yourself. Okay. I'm just spit balling here, but why don't we arrange a crusade or take in some special offerings to be able to save the gym? Like, those men's conferences in the bush? Yeah, but that sounds exactly like - my tantric workshop - No it's not. What I mean is men connecting together, praising God and putting your hands - on each other - Laying hands on each other - Calm down. - Feeling... Calm down, Faith like Potatoes. It's never going to happen. Okay. Any other ideas? Nothing? I have an idea. Funi said that I must get her information that'll take them down. She didn't say anything about helping them. Why don't you guys start one of those crowdfunding pages and reach out to anyone who's ever set foot in this gym and see if they're willing to help? I don't know, hey. Sounds a lot like begging. Ja, but it doesn't seem like you have much of a choice. I have some friends who are running this independent cinema that was going under and they organised a movie marathon and whoever stayed in the cinema the longest won lifetime membership. And then a raffle was done for the people who had bet on those people to win the same. I mean they only did it for one night and they raised about 400K. And you guys have been active for almost 60 years. Pretty sure there's tons of people who'd be willing to participate. It's not a bad idea. Ja, like Paul and I could reach out to our old boxing community. I could get some local media involved and some influencers? Yeah, we could have the prize be a lifetime membership to the gym? And, and, a smoothie, named after the winner of the raffle. That's cute. Come on, these are good ideas. I guess we have nothing to lose. It's not exactly what I had in mind but Zintle was right. We don't have a choice. But before I set up the campaign, I want to send that woman a message. Let her know we're not going down without a fight. Yeah, we are right on track. The building is almost finished and the marketing team will launch the campaign at the end of this month, Joseph. That's great to to hear. You get this right and you'll be looking at a very, very healthy bonus at the end of the year. Look Joseph, I'm going to have to call you back. I just arrived at the gym and there's some business I desperately need to take care of. You go get 'em, tiger. You can set the end of the campaign over there. Yeah. And then we can kind of like do paid promotion so it reaches people in the area. I like that. Are you ready to go live? I think so. Let's go. Take that Starz Gym. Zintle, why are you not picking up your phone? Call me back when you get this message. I want to know what that little troll is up to next. Yeah. Sharp. Oh, it's so on motherfucker. We've decided to really throw ourselves into this. Bianca designed some flyers to market the campaign, and I got all the staff to hand them out to our members. We also took Jackson's workout board and turned it into a campaign tracker so everyone can see our progress. You guys ready? Let's do it. I think... I think he's dead. Did he die? Yeah no, he died. Obviously you can't call him. Hey! Oh, do you remember Sandy? Sandy? Sandy man. She, she married that like, mercenary from Angola. From Angola, that's right. Yeah yeah. I think he's become head of the Department of Roads or something now. Yeah. So Paul and I, we don't really you know, do the social media thing. So we had to resort to looking at photo albums and address books and filofaxes, you know, old school way. Let's call her. What's her number? There we go. Cool. God, we looked good hey, Paul? So what Daryn doesn't know is that I haven't always just been a fitness model. You know what I mean? Ja. Wow. Shit. I mean, like I know by today's standards it's really tame, but back then, let's just say... my centerfold was a hit. Gosh, I had the biggest tits back then when I gave birth to Daryn. I got a lot of work at that time, yeah. I think I breastfed him for about like two years, you know, just to keep them that way 'cause they're beautiful. Hey, maybe that's why we're so close. What's for breakfast? This one has pineapple, coconut milk, strawberries, mint and some hemp protein. - Yummy. - Yummy. You know, on paper, Jackson and I really shouldn't get along. He's religious. I'm spiritual. He's a bro. I'm a naturalist. He's Xhosa. I'm Afrikaans. He's a meat eater. I'm raw vegan with a nut allergy. Polar opposites. You are speaking to the manager. Yes. Yeah. Uh huh. Shame. Richard's got a bit of a crush on me. He leaves me little notes and romantic things. I've never felt like this before. She's like the most incredible women in the world. Well, this is a bit of a dramatic location to meet. It's as if you are planning a murder. That would make me happy. Anyway, what's happening that side? Well... They are broke, but you already knew that. And the members are really committed, so it's going to be hard getting them out. Do you think they will want to sell? - I don't know. - Why They've just started a crowdfunding page to try and save the gym and they're putting it out to all the old members, so even though it's only been running for a couple of days they've raised about 100K I want you to keep your eyes open and if there's something that could compromise them for me I want to know. Team, I want you to sign up for membership at Miller & Sons. Infiltrate the system, Trojan style, and when I give the signal... It's early days, but people are contributing. What's been really great is that we're starting to get new members thanks to the word of mouth. It's pretty old school but that's where you get your proper workout. You know? Like the kind of members you'd be proud to say went to your gym. I think one's a model. Hey, you. Hi. You thirsty? Yeah, I can drink something. Thank you. Cool. Just, don't let Jacques see us. He makes such shit coffee but I can't bear to tell him. Oh, I know of a place where we can go. Follow me. This is like when we used to sneak by the tuck shop at school and drink beers, hey? No, not me. I was playing first team rugby so, started drinking in varsity. Always a good boy. Pauly, always the good boy. You think he's okay? Daza. It's a lot of pressure hey, and he's not his dad. He's stronger than you think he is. I hope so. How are you doing? Hmm? It must be tough coming here. It is. His memories everywhere, hey? Even in here. You have memories in here? Ja. I mean, where else do you think Bianca was conceived? - No. - Yes. Yeah, Paul's still got it. Like, I know I'm supposed to be in mourning but what can I say? The guy's aged well and I've seen him in boxing shorts so I know what he's hiding back there. Are you in? Yeah. Done. Oh, my God Holy shit. What the hell, Jackson... - Bianca? - Move out of the fucking way. What's happening? I don't know but everyone... No, no. Oh my God. Oh my God, it's coming. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh no, no. I don't care who you are or what belief systems you have when a cold brown hits even the most hardcore of atheist starts to pray. This place is disgusting. I'm sorry. It must be one of the animals, they escaped from the pet section. Who brings pet rats to gym? No wonder you are going under. I'm sorry. Help. Please help. Please help. I think we need to call an ambulance. I didn't know a body could bend like that. He looked like he was turning into a busted Transformer. What are you doing here? Just being a good neighbour. I mean, I heard some screaming and I just wanted to check if everything was okay. We're fine. So what hospital are they taking him to? The one up the road? Wh... why? Oh nothing I thought maybe I should just pop in and take him some flowers, with a card for a good lawyer, you know? I think you should go. Oh, my pleasure. You know, every time I'm here my allergies just act up, you know. Must be the asbestos in your ceiling. We don't have asbestos. Sure. I'm not going to lie. I love watching him squirm. Shit. What? No, no it's nothing. What is it? Yeah, you don't... you don't wanna see it. Show me. Give me the phone. Hey come on, give me the phone. Okay fine but don't say I didn't warn you. Okay? Please help! This is going to ruin the campaign. Yeah. Still early days, I guess. Yeah. I think just give it some time. Bianca. Hi. Hi. It's just, it's someone from the news. What do they want? I don't know. Daryn Miller, hello. I may or may not have sent an anonymous tip off to a journalist about a gym rivalry in the area. The viral video didn't hurt its news value. And now rounding off today's news we have a classic David and Goliath battle playing out right here in our own backyard between family gym, Miller & Sons and the multinational fitness conglomerate Starz Gym. It also happens to be the gym where a certain flying runner video that went viral this week took place in. Please help! Joining me is owner of Miller & Sons, Daryn Miller, thank you so much for your time. Hi Shahan, I'm very excited to be here. So tell me more about this runner. How's he doing? Michael? He's okay. He won't be doing the Comrades this year, but his doctor did say that he will be back on the treadmill by the start of next year. He's been with the gym for 15 years. He's a regular at Miller & Sons. Well, that's great to hear. Now, tell me what's happening down there in Randburg? Well, we've been in the area for 60 years. The gym was opened by my grandfather and a few weeks ago we woke up to a really nasty surprise when we found out that the Starz franchise were planning on opening a branch right across the road from us. But surely these two gyms can co-exist? You cater to different people. That's what I thought but when I went over to try and be a good neighbour, the new owner, she... she said... She said she's going to destroy our shitty little gym. That is intense, but let me just remind you that it's a family show we have to be careful with our language. Sorry. But our producers are telling me about a signage issue between the two. What's happening there? Oh that. Well, they decided to put a big sign outside our entrance to take a dig at us. So we did the same, put a sign outside theirs. I figured that if we can't get along and be good neighbours, at least we can be good enemies and fight fire with fire. You go my boytjie. I know Michelle Obama says that when they go low, you go high. But I'm of the opinion that when somebody steps on you when you're down, it's the perfect opportunity to trip them up. Well, bold move but where does this all go then, Daryn? I'm not going to sit here and lie to you. We are struggling and if we don't bring in some cash by the end of December, we're going to have to close our doors after 60 years. That's why we set up the crowdfunding page with some really cool prizes... I'm just hoping that, people see our value and they not seduced by flashy, corporate branding. Yeah. Well, that's great words. I know it can't be easy doing what you're doing. We are rooting for you. Thank you. Well, we invited Starz Gym to comment, but they refused our invitation. We've also included the link to Miller & Sons crowdfunding page below. So if you're someone like me, who believes in supporting local business, why not send some cash their way. That's it for me, Shahan Ramkissoon for today. You're watching ENCA. You killed it! Right in the jugular man. Yes! My man! I didn't know you had it in you. Dude! Your interview has gone viral. You have over 200000 views online. What? Just look at your funding page. R450 000. I wonder what my dad would've thought about all of this. We almost there, little guy. He was like the coolest guy ever. Way cooler than I could ever be. When we were kids, Bianca used to tell me that I was adopted and that my dad worked for the Post Ofiice. I believed her for a bit until my daddy showed me one day that I had his eyes. Two more, two more, two more. Push, push, push. One more. Yes. 20 mins on the bike. There he is. R5,000 away from our goal. What a legend. You're the legend. I wanted to know if I could ask your advice, in the lady department. Anytime, Daryn. Listen here boet. You're gonna have to walk with me. I gotta get ready for church. What's on your mind, brother? There's this girl that I like. Respect. How long you guys been together? That's the thing, right. She doesn't know. Still early days. Problem is I freeze every time we have a 'moment'. Shit, stage fright. What do I do? I like her. Got to make that change, brother. What would you do? Ever since I got saved, I've just devoted my entire energy to serving God and being celibate. Okay. It's the best thing I've ever done. I even had my virginity restored. Yeah. Our pastor was teaching on sexual purity and told us that God makes all things brand new. There was this girl from America. She had been banging like every guy in town. When she was saved, she asked God to restore her virginity and her 'seal' grew back. Wow. It's... It's excellent. So I figured... I figured if He could do it for her, He could do it for me. So I asked the pastor to pray for me and it worked. I know it is difficult to tell since I am a man and all but I know it works, I can feel it. Before I was a virgin, I was having so much sex. We're not at the sex part yet. I know what to do... when we get there. I'm struggling with the whole letting her know I like her, part of it all. Okay, okay. Do you know... girls really fall for me because of my sense of humor and intellect. So I always try and put it in the foreground. Ladies love a funny guy. Yeah, yeah exactly, you are a funny guy. Just make sure you have some jokes lined up and make sure they come across quite natural. You know what I'm saying? You know what? If you have a connection with someone, you don't have to win them over. They'll like you for you. And remember you can do all things through Christ who gives you strength. All things. Uh-huh Hmmm. Ja. No problem, I'll call you right back. Shame. Um, my brother isn't exactly the coolest on earth, and when he falls for someone, it can be a bit uncomfortable to watch. Like when I see a couple, my first thought is to imagine them having sex. But with Daryn, I don't know. I imagine it would be more like someone doing Cross Fit while watching The Notebook. Like lots of sweat and crying. This one is my favourite. Fresh blueberries, banana, almond milk, peanut butter and... chia seeds. Enjoy. Oh, oh. May I? Let me help you there. Tell me has anyone ever milked your prostate? The campaign, it's going really well and what makes it even better is that it's all happening around Christmas. It's my favorite holiday. We deck the gym in bright colours to brighten up your workout. A snow machine to make it feel like it's winter. And a Christmas tree. A real Christmas tree, not a plastic one. And best of all on the 24th, I dress up like Father Christmas and you can come and sit on my lap and tell me whether you've been naughty or nice. I can already hear Boney M playing in my dreams. Christmas is about the birth of a saviour. Not this rubbish. We should all be in church thanking God for the birth of His son. But instead we're waiting for some fat guy to slide down the chimney to give us gifts. It's a mess. So, Daryn's put me in charge of this Secret Santa thing we're doing. A gift can't be more than a hundred rand, and I get to choose who's paired with each other. I like to mess with things so I take one or two names out. Merry Christmas Ah, this is for... This is last year, it was Daryn. R250 bucks away, guys. We're 250 bucks away. Come on 250. Yes! We did it, we did it! Congratulations. Well done, man. Well done. Daryn. Guys, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just want to take this moment to thank... each and every one of you for all your support during... the campaign. I couldn't have done it without you. And God. Your dad would be so proud. No, we're chilled, we're chilled. We're fine, we're fine. Na-uh Funi, I am not doing it. This is not a request. Why don't you ask one of your trainers? They're already in the gym? You think I'm going to trust those pay-as-you-go bodyguards with something as important as this? I want it to be you. And what if I get caught? Then make sure you don't get caught. Why are you like this? Somebody has to be. It's enough to get him a fine, but not enough for him to sleep in jail. If he sleeps in jail it will only be for a weekend and that is it. Okay? Just remember, Zintle everything I do, I do for you. And only you. Think about your yoga studio. You are looking ashy there. You should change your lotion, sis. Something inside me has changed. I feel like a new man. I think I was stuck in a bit of a rut before this whole campaign, but it showed me that if I put my mind to something, I can do it. My dad used to tell me that if I wanted to I could be as big as he was. All I needed to do was to put down the fatcake and work out. So that's what I'm going to do. I even dusted off one of his old protein shake recipes he showed me when I was a boy. I don't really like the raw eggs but if it worked for Rocky, it must be good. I might even ask Zintle out on a date. Can't really afford to take her to the movies but, I can take her on a picnic. Hi Zintle, are you looking for me? Ja, I was also just tying my shoelace. I wanted to find out if it's okay for me to work half day on Thursday, I've got a family thing in the afternoon. Hundred percent. You can take the whole day if you like. Thank you but that won't be necessary. The morning class is picking up really nicely and I don't want to lose momentum. That's awesome. If you're not doing anything on Friday, I wanted to know if I could take you out to dinner? That's only if you're not doing anything. Ja. Ja. Sounds good. Awesome. I'll pick you up at 7. Cool. See you at 7. Jaun. Hi. It's... it's been a while. You know me, still trying to rock the world. Yeah. Listen, I know how super busy you are but I was wondering if you could make some time for me? Back in the day, I used to hook up with a guy who now works for the police department. He was a waiter and I just started out as a trainer. God, that man used to toss my salad like he was auditioning for Master Chef. There's this gym across the road and they're up to some dodgy shit. Steroids, maybe more. And I was wondering if you could swing past and clean things up for me? No, no, no. Not now. Wait until Christmas Eve so he can spend the holiday in jail. Yeah. Oh, and what would you get in return? Well. She said yes. I was shaking but she said yes. It's basically a Christmas miracle. I'm just going to have to do what Jackson said. Put my best foot forward. Hopefully that will be enough. I'm obviously not going in there to pressure her into anything You probably never tell this by looking at me but... I'm a virgin. I almost lost it once on the cruise ships. Beautiful woman named Andrea. She stayed with me in my room and told me she was waiting for the perfect moment for the two of us to make love. Anyway, it turns out she was a stowaway from Tunisia and we dropped her off in Greece. You look so handsome, my Daz. Thanks, Mommy. Now listen, you make sure you take all the time you need. You hear me? I hear you. And here're the keys for Bliksem. Thank you, Uncle Paul. I promise I won't speed. Oh no no. His speeding days are long gone. You'll be lucky if he goes over 60. Thank you. Oh wait, wait, Daz. I almost forgot. So your father won this the night we... on the night that we met and... Maybe it will bring you luck. It sure brought him some. Thanks, Mommy. Goodbye. Bye. Just look at him. He's so cute. Loved Christmas. Loved wearing a Speedo. I hated that Speedo. Loved eating fruit but fruit did not love him, still. Not a good idea, he gets the squirts. You know, the thing about Daz though is that he didn't want to come out of my womb. Like he just didn't want to. It was three weeks after due date, and the doc said "that is it, enough is enough" and he went in to evict the boytjie. And then ja, Daz came out with a full head of hair and about three teeth. His sister on the other hand, Bianca, she couldn't wait to get out, hey. She just tore my vajayjay right in half. But he'll always be my little Daz. My little guy. God, I hope he's got rid of that Speedo. Love you. You did good with that kid. Ja. He's my precious boy. Pauly? How are you going to get home now? Come to think of it, I haven't even thought about that. Maybe you could give me a ride? Ja, I think that can be arranged. Can I get you some wine? Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. It stings, it got a bit... I like the burn going down. It's nice. So... I just wanted to say thank you for believing in me. I have never had anybody like you in my life before. It was really nothing. Wow. I think I love you. Daryn, I'm not sure if I misled you, but this... doesn't feel right. No, you're right It's the wine. It's the wine. Should we just call it a night? Sure. Ja. Can't believe I misread the signals. I was pretty sure we had a vibe. It was probably the wine. Probably shouldn't have that much fizz. Ja, last time was fine. We had a few drinks, huh? And... and then, um... and then we had a good night kiss. Stop it, Pauly. Shut up. Morning. Hi. Sorry. - So sorry - It's okay. I got it, I got... Let me help you. Sorry. It's okay, thank you. I'm trying not to make things awkward between Zintle and myself at work. It's been difficult. I can't stop thinking about that kiss. I even got her a bracelet. From the jewelry section at the Bruma Flea Market. I guess I have to take it back now. But it is the day before Christmas, so I get to have some fun. Okay. Oh alright, alright, alright. Here we go. Uncle Daryn's very scary. Yes he is. I know, very ugly. Here we go mommy. Alright, everyone. It's time for the Miller & Sons Secret Santa. All right. Mom, this is from Paul. Cool. Oh, I... I love it. Ah, it's nothing. It's just a few tunes from the radio that I made for you. I spent the whole weekend sitting by the radio, trying to make that thing. I love it. Jacques, this is from TD Jakes over there. It's about a bodybuilder who got saved and built a church in Florida. It ministered to me. Thank you. Jackson, it's from Jacques. Wow. It's one of those things that makes your forearms stronger. I love it. Bless you. Right, my turn. What's that about? I don't know. Hi, officers. Welcome to Miller & Sons gym. Merry Christmas. Are you the owner of this establishment? I am, yes. Daryn JNR. How can I help you? We have a warrant to search the premises. I'm going to need you to remain where you are while my partner takes a look around. Sure wha... what are you looking for? That doesn't matter. Go to the office and work your way back. What did you do? Why would you ask me something like that? Because we have officers searching our premises and I remember what you did in high school. Okay. I got arrested once in grade eight for shoplifting and now I'm the fucking Winona of the family. Found it. What's that? Daryn Miller I am arresting you for the possession of illegal substances. There has to be a mistake. I haven't even smoked a cigarette my life. Why don't you do us a favor and just turn around? No, not until you tell me what's inside. Stay right there. Darren, calm down. Mom don't touch him, don't touch him. Why? Look away. Fuck... I hate it when they piss themselves. You fuck with me. I burn your house down. With your kids inside. We're going to need a mop. I've never been so humiliated in my life. And worst of all it happened over Christmas Eve so I had to spend the whole holiday in jail. Luckily I had met Chappie to keep me company. Like me he was framed for dealing and... murder. Anyway, we exchanged numbers for when he gets out, we can keep in contact. I've been released. They gave me a pretty big fine. Like all the money we raised for the gym, kind of big. And a bit more. I feel horrible. Things were really not supposed to get this bad. And now I think I fucked things up with Daryn. Hi, Daryn. It's me. I'm just checking in on you after everything that happened. Let me know. Maybe I can come around. I can bring a pizza. We could just hang out and just not think about everything. Is everything okay? I don't know. You tell me. I can explain. There is no need to. Please, Daryn. I can't believe I trusted you. Daryn, please. I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm going to have to ask you to go. Daryn, please. I think maybe if we just sit down and have a conver... Please go. You and your sister got what you came for. Zintle, please go. Go! I think I am going to give Funi a call. See if her offer's still on the table. Funeka hello. And you can fuck right off if you're a telemarketer. It's Daryn. Oh. I'm calling to find out if I can still take you up on your offer. Are you serious? I am. That is great to hear. I'll send you an offer to purchase first thing tomorrow morning. Thank you. Oooooooo mama. I have to be out by the end of the week. So I'll just... maybe I'll see if I can get my old job back on the cruise ships. I'm just going to take a few days to... catch my breath. I can have everything out by the end of the week for you. Now that it's done I feel a bit sorry for the guy. He put up more of a fight than I thought he would. If you want, we're looking for managers and I could put in a good word for you at HQ. I wouldn't work for you if my life depended on it. Suit yourself. I just want to thank you all for for everything that you've brought to this place. My favourite... My favourite part of coming to work was getting to see you all. I wish... I wish I could have done more to save the gym. I wish I... I wish I had what it took. I'm gonna miss you. It's okay, man. We'll still see each other. I'll even come to church with you Eew, no. This isn't Bishops. You did good, my boy. What I didn't tell you is that David doesn't always beat Goliath. But what counts, what counts is that you threw the stone. Thank you, Uncle Paul. Richard. Poor kid. I really thought it would work out for him. Ja. I just hope he doesn't have to go back to working on that ship. I mean when a mom's got a dream about what their boy's going to turn out to be, Tickey the clown's not on top of the list. What do you want? Hey, we need to talk. I have an idea that could save the gym. One thing that Funi didn't realise is that by asking me to plant those steroids, she was making herself vulnerable. Vulnerable to me. Goodbyes are very hard for me. I don't know why but they always get me feeling very... heavy inside. I think it's because I never got to say goodbye to my dad before he... before he passed. He was already very sick when I got offered the job, but he was the one who told me follow my dreams and take it. He said "I'll be fine, my boy." "You get on that ship and make people smile." I'm going to miss you. "I'll be here waiting for you when you get back." I think that's why it hurts so much. It's like he's still here... in every weight... and in every piece of equipment. It sounds stupid but I thought that if I could save the gym, maybe I could keep a part of him here with me. That way I would never have to say goodbye. Happy New Year, Daryn. Happy New Year, everybody. But not you. You mother fucker. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you, Funi. You poes. Daddy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lost everything that you and Oupa worked for. Daddy, it is gone. All gone. Are you finished with your tantrum now? No. I haven't. Why are you here? What do you want? You're going to give Darren back the money he paid for the fine. I'm not crazy. In what world would that be a possibility? One where I turned myself in... and I tell the police and your bosses that it was us that planted the drugs. You wouldn't. Try me. Fuck. Daryn, open the door. Daryn. Daryn. Daryn. Daryn. Why aren't you answering your phone? What do you want? We've got something to show you boss. I asked you not to call me that anymore. What do you want? I don't want to talk to the two of you. Daryn, please just hear me out, okay. It was me. I'm... I'm the one that planted the roids in your office. Only because Funi forced me to. Oh, telling me that makes you feel better. No, it doesn't, but this is why I'm here. I told Funi that if she doesn't want me to tell the police and her bosses at Starz, then she's going to have to pay you back the money you were fined, out of her own pocket. What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say that you don't have to sell the gym, Daryn. You can keep it. And you, why are you here? This is just being a good neighbour. I'll make sure your money hits your bank account first thing tomorrow morning. And your gym, are you still opening tomorrow? Yes! Somehow I don't think the people that walk into this gym would be a good fit for the Starz brand. So I don't see us being competition to each other. Fine. But I want interest, 15% on the top. To being good neighbours. To being good neighbours. That's enough of that. Okay. So I'll leave you all to it. I do have a gym to open up tomorrow. Congratulations! Well done by the way, Daryn. 15% interest, good for you. We did it. Yeah, but you do stink and you need to change shirts. This does look good though. Zintle! I'm really sorry. You probably don't want to talk to me anymore because I messed up so badly. I just want to say I'm sorry. Thank you. I probably should have brushed my teeth. Yeah, you probably should have. Okay. I have a gym to open up. Yes! Go, Daza! Hi. Howzit. Hi, welcome. I think it's safe to say that everything turned out for the best and the resolution crowd didn't disappoint at all. And Starz Gym had their big opening the other day and Daryn and I went over to support Fu. I think there is something happening between her and Jacques. No man! Don't be weird. He's like a hundred percent not her type. Ma and Uncle Paul seem to have hit it off as well. I didn't see that one coming. I'm not complaining. Do you think I have to start calling him Daddy? So Jackson has also gone off to North Africa somewhere on a mission with his church. When Jesus says men should not live on bread alone I truly believe he was embracing a low carb diet. So that means no bread, no rice, no pap. Just healthy fats and proteins. Amen. And Bianca decided she wants to be a part of the film industry. Which is pretty perfect because Richard did the same. The two of them have their films up on some popular website called OnlyFans. I keep asking her to show them to me, but she won't send me a link. Okay, push in when I get the carrots out. Fuck, yeah. Can I tell them? It finally happened. It. We did it. We had sex. Oh, fuck! Oh, God. Oh, fuck it.
