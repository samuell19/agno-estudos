(YOGA) Clear your mind of worldly thoughts. Only warmth will be left behind. (EUGENE / CHA SOO-YEON) Now slowly turn and pull yourself up. (CHO EUN-JI / PARK HAN-BYUL) (KIM HYE-NA / LEE YOUNG-JIN HWANG SEUNG-UN) (Written and directed by YUN JAE-YEON) And we're on in five seconds. And... Cue host. Inside our studio today, we can feel the sizzling feelings of summer already. And summer nights are all about lingerie. I have them on right now. I'd love to show our customers at home how amazing they look, but I shouldn't, right? Yes, our great quality, design, and prices... I hope it doesn't get sold out. I need to buy some for my friends. But I'll save one for you, Hyo-jung. Cue sold out. 34B sold out, and... Cue. 34B bras are sold out. We sold out sooner than we expected. Thanks to the support of our customers. That's all the time we have for today. But we'll be back soon. Thank you. - That's a wrap. - Great job, people. - Great show. - Good job. You can't cut someone off on the air, Han-byul. Co-hosting is all about teamwork, all right? I also was startled because you froze up. You're a pageant girl, right? I know you're just starting out here, but the studio isn't some club. Sorry. It just helps to loosen up a little. Thanks to Han-byul, we made good numbers. Great job. I've got to go. Today, beauty is power. Money. The upper hand. Intelligence is basically a given. And the younger, the better. I heard Eun-hye is marrying a co-worker. - Eun-hye is? - Yeah. With a plain white collar guy? I wouldn't say plain... His father is head of the board. I should put her past pictures up on their website. Honey, please. Just give her your best wishes. She won't need them. All men will cheat in the end. So it's smart to marry one who's rich. Even if she gets divorced, she'll still end up rich. Hey, Hyo-jung. You busy this Sunday? Why? There's a great guy in our partner firm. He's doing very well and has a rich family. What are you doing? You know she's with Dong-hoon. Nice guys like him are hard to find. Dating and marriage are entirely different things. Being nice won't pay the bills. I thought Sun-hwa was coming today. Who called her? I did. You're in for a big shock. - A shock? - Why? You're all here early. Is that really you? Didn't I tell you? I'm gonna need some lD. I didn't recognize her either. You are KIM Sun-hwa! How are you? What a surprise. Great seeing you! I'm enjoying your show. You should've called the network. They would've given you my number. We've run into each other often. The lingerie you sell is my brand. You haven't changed a bit. You've changed into a whole other person. All right. Smile. Three, two, one. I love you. Please... Hold me tight in your arms. 'Shadows of Youth' was the last film that KANG directed. That's right. Have a good trip. - And drive safe. - Don't worry, man. Can't you trust me, and wait for me? That tells me that you don't love me anymore! You... You don't love me anymore. You didn't even hear me come in. You're home. What is this? You remember? We're doing a documentary on classic films. That's for rich people with too much time. As if a documentary will change anything. Do something noteworthy, and make some money... Can't you clean up after yourself? Something happened at work, huh. - What's up? Tell me. - Just leave me alone. I think we should take a break. Don't pout, babe. I'm not kidding around! I don't want to live like this! I'm sick of it! I was wearing you out all this time... Where are you going? Where the heck are you going? Yeah, great. That's good. The phones are ringing. Let's keep it up! What is this, PARK? Huh? Have you seen yourself lately? All of a sudden I'm not hot enough to make sales? Well, She's a former pageant queen and all. We'll talk later. Do I look stupid? How could you do this to me? Are you insane? Can't you see us on air? Doesn't hourly sales ring a bell? The food department is great. Mackerel. What's not to love? KIM Sun-hwa! We need to talk. Don't you want to tell me something? I have nothing against you. Are you kidding me? I got fired because of you! Because of me? Is that what you really think? It's hard to acknowledge one's own faults. Don't blame me and take a good look at yourself. The world is a tough, intolerant place. If you want, I think I can help you out. Listen closely. There are regular week-long sessions of intensive training. They should be about now. There's no sign, so remember this. There's a waterfall on the first floor. Waterfall? KAHN Mi-hi runs this yoga academy. KAHN Mi-hi? But it's hard to see her in person. How can I help you? I was referred here... There are no classes next week. During intensive training, we don't accept new students. I came to take that intensive training. I'm sorry, but intensive training is not for anyone. Only students with over a year of yoga practice can participate. I'd like to speak to your manager. There's no use in talking to her. You need to meet the manager. Can I help you? They're going to reject you at first. But keep pushing. It's like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff. And people are rushing toward me to push me off the edge. What I'm saying is... I want to throw myself away and be born again as a whole new person. Born again sounds very intriguing. But you must meet KAHN Mi-hi on the last day. Only she knows the real secret. Hey, Hyo-jung. KIM Hyo-jung! Why didn't you answer your phone? Good luck. Good luck with what? It's nothing. - Hey, wait up! - Hurry up. We're in the same homeroom and art class every single day. Why are you suddenly ignoring me? Stop embarrassing me! But you're ignoring me! What's wrong with you? Hyo-jung, tell me what I did wrong. Don't you have any other friends? I just don't like you! So leave me alone! We're just different. You're too ugly and poor! What? So? You want me to shoot that shit again? (INTENSIVE TRAINING: FIRST DAY) I told you, I don't do that anymore. Stop getting me such bad jobs! Don't call me for a while. Whatever! I just won't pick up. Did you eat yet? I wasn't sure if I should or not, so I brought some with me. If you're hungry, help yourselves. I brought a lot. Thank you. Here. You can have it all. Wait... Your nose... What's wrong with it? I'm sorry. That came out wrong. But something went wrong with the procedure, didn't it? My goodness... You've made a difficult decision. I'm Na-ni. I'll be guiding your week-long training. Yoga not only refreshes the body, but also the mind. As it is a physical activity, I need your full trust and cooperation. This place was really hard to find. Why isn't there a sign? Those destined to come will find their way. Like yourselves. Once within the academy walls, contact with the outside is forbidden. Please place your cell phones on the table. That's strange. I thought I had it... This is the cafeteria. There are rules to be followed during training sessions. First... Unauthorized eating is forbidden. Wise souls dine in the morning beasts in the evening, and ghosts dine at night? I'm hungry already... Secondly, no baths and showers within an hour after training. Contact with water will wear you out and disrupt the channeled energy. Filthy. This is the training hall. Wait. Why aren't there any mirrors? Third. You must not look at mirrors while training. Mirrors only reflect, shrouding the essence within. This is ridiculous. Excuse me... It's that way. And lastly, you cannot speak of this program to anyone in the outside world. When will we be meeting KAHN Mi-hi? Ms. KAHN will join us on the last day. There are mice, too? What's wrong? You promised to be quiet. What is in your bag? I'm sorry, ma'am. There's no one home to watch her. You cannot keep this here. Please, just this once... She's only a few months old. She needs love and care. I can't leave her home alone. I don't think it will disrupt the training... Then I will keep this for you. You must not become distracted. Hang in there! Mommy will come for you! What's the scale for? I can't go a day without this. But you're so thin. Well, I used to be really fat. Like forty-five pounds heavier. Now I get so nervous if I don't weigh myself. I'm SEO In-soon. I'm KIM Hyo-jung. Nice to meet you. Why don't we all introduce ourselves? We'll be staying together for a while... I'm KIM Hyo-jung. I'm an infomercial host. I knew I recognized you. I love that network... The real celebrity seems to be over there... Huh? SUNG Yeon-ju? Are you really SUNG Yeon-ju? I thought you looked like her, but I never imagined it was really you... I'm sorry, but I'd like to keep things quiet while I'm here. What's your name? Bo-ra. LEE Bo-ra. Thanks so much for earlier. You seem really nice. You go to church, right? My neighbor looks just like you. She goes to church and always acts so nice. I mean, she's nice. Min-Ji, mommy's sorry... That goddamn doctor... Reflect on what you're thinking of. What is truly deceiving you. And if it is keeping you from being free. Look into your heart. Suspicion only leads to self-destruction. You must have faith and trust in your instructor. Flowing water will cleanse the river, but a pool of water is turbid and cannot sustain life. A weary and feeble mind cannot find its true path or the will to go on. If a climber runs out of strength, he cannot reach the pinnacle. You will gain nothing from training if you cannot overcome your own limits. Relieve yourselves of everything. Be free. Relieve yourselves of your tortured souls. Stop wasting time on surgery, and spend it with our daughter! You idiot! Popularity comes and goes. Snap back to reality! Mommy, I'm scared... O soul, vanish from within. Goddess of beauty, I call to thee. Shine your beauty upon your servant. O soul, vanish from within. Goddess of beauty, I call to thee. Shine your beauty upon your servant. O soul, vanish from within. Goddess of beauty, I call to thee. Shine your beauty upon your servant. O soul, vanish from within. Goddess of beauty, I call to thee. Shine your beauty upon your servant. O soul, vanish from within. Goddess of beauty, I call to thee. Shine your beauty upon your servant. (INTENSIVE TRAINING: SECOND DAY) Great song. What is it? It's good, huh. It's from 'Shadows of Youth'. KAHN Mi-hi was director KANG's leading lady for all his movies, until his last film, 'Shadows of Youth' where OH Eun-shil was the new female lead. It's all because of her voice. That's when they started live recording. The one flaw of the biggest star at the time is her voice. That's right. It should be right about here... Stop. God, that was close. If she weren't so pretty... Director KANG? Director KANG Hee-joong? I'm CHOl Dong-hoon. I called you earlier. I'm telling you, I saw her come out. What woman? don't lie to me! There's no one there but you. - I know what I saw. - They're right. They found traces of a woman inside his house. Some lipstick on a coffee cup. Stop stalling and just send them home. Hyo-jung's phone is off. It's not like her... I'll see you later, man. There are seven chakras inside everyone's body. Once they're awakened, all of the energy shoots up the spine to the head. Then, the Kundalini hidden inside the body shoots up and bursts open like a blooming flower. What happens when it opens? You reach a perfectly-balanced state of beauty. Perfection. Is there such a thing? Not everything is a sham. Just look at this picture. Everyone ages, but KAHN Mi-hi is still young and beautiful. They say that she opened her Kundalini. But only one of us gets a chance. Only that person can meet her and awaken her Kundalini. Only one of us? Gosh, you all put on a great act. Like you didn't already know all this? I'm sleepy... I hope the Kundalini is something I can eat. How will I survive this? I can stand anything else, but not being hungry... Hadn't seen Sun-hwa in years... She isn't the Sun-hwa I used to know. Yu-kyung. Can't you hear that? - That sound. - What sound? (INTENSIVE TRAINING: THIRD DAY) I'm sorry if I hurt you, (1978, SET OF 'SHADOWS OF YOUTH') but I tried my best. You're a woman, too... Aren't you, Mrs. LEE? Is it such a sin to love a man? He... does not love you. Cut! Can you not hear what your acting sounds like? Rolling again in three, everyone. Get it ready. Next, you'll take the gun out of the bag and place it on Lena's desk. Then Lena will shoot herself with it. - And later it will be revealed... - Acting isn't just about the face anymore. An actor needs the right voice. You're doing great, but I would put more feeling into the line. Hey, what's our next scene? I'm sorry. What the heck are you doing? Are you all right? Come quick! Yu-kyung. Yu-kyung! What's wrong? There's something on me. Can you take a look? There's nothing there. I need to take a shower or I'll go crazy. But it hasn't been an hour since training. Will she be okay? Baths and showers are forbidden for an hour after training. God, I don't care. I'm starving! I've got no energy and everything looks like food. You smell nice and tasty... Something's wrong with me. I'm gonna get some water. Doesn't this woman eat anything? I'm so hungry... That prick. What does she eat? This is ridiculous. Please, just one crumb. Please! Is someone there? If you're there, open the door! I have to go. Who locked the door? Perfect beauty? Beauty, give me a break. Who's there? Yu-kyung... Yu-kyung! Everyone return to your places. I will take care of this. I've asked you to follow the rules. Rules? A person is dying here. And you still talk about rules! She's right. She brought this on herself. Let's just go. How can you say that? What? I sacrificed a lot to be here, and what if she ruined everything? Like you weren't thinking the same thing. Did I say something wrong? Does that matter at a time like this? Don't take it out on me! It's her that broke the rules! She's just happy as there's less competition. What? Only one person can get the Kundalini, so you're secretly glad. Aren't you? What about you? Isn't that what you're thinking? Freeloading bum. What did you call me? A bum? What's all the fuss? You've never heard of your own nickname? You can't carry a note, but you still bum off your band. - You bum. - You better shut your mouth! So pretty, but so clueless. You won't be pretty forever, you stupid bimbo! Come on! Stop it! What's wrong with you? Let's just worry about going home in one piece! Fine. I'm sorry I was harsh. You happy? You think you know me? Do you know how many times I tried to kill myself because of idiots like you? Once people start to let you down... I mean, once they hurt you... It's really hard to trust them again. Their love... Their adoration... It all changes overnight. But true love isn't supposed to change at all. That's why... It's so hard to come back out into the world. Don't mind her. She's just jealous of you. I'm gonna get wrinkles now. She keeps getting on my nerves. How do I look, though? Do I look okay? Gosh, if only I had a mirror! I have a mirror... Do you want to borrow it? Please. It is only a side-effect. Fasting leads to hallucinations and such. It is only temporary before things get better, so don't worry too much. Look. You see this? This looks like a hallucination to you? You are free to leave at will. No one is keeping you here. But once you leave, you cannot have the Kundalini. (INTENSIVE TRAINING: FOURTH DAY) I was starting to get worried too. How could she not even call me? Do you have any idea where she might be? I do have a feeling about something... Do you know KIM Sun-hwa? We went to high school with her. We met her again at the reunion recently. Hold on. That picture... Yeah, that's Sun-hwa. I saw them whispering a few days ago. She wished Hyo-jung good luck on something. KIM Sun-hwa? You're KIM Sun-hwa, right? How do you know me? Where is Hyo-jung? And why are you asking me this? I don't know where she is. We've met before. This is yours, isn't it? You know where she is! You think this will change anything? You fool. Empty your soul and the visions will fade. They're only realizations of the darkness within. Place this by your pillow. It will help you sleep peacefully. Beauty comes at a great price. Only when you have overcome yourself can your true beauty shine at its brightest. The Kundalini is mine. Shut up, you little prick! No! Stop! I came to see Mr. YOON! Who are you? There's no one here by that name. I know you were KANG's assistant director. Shut up and get out of here! No! Do you know that KANG is dead? OH Eun-shil's death wasn't an accident. It was the last day of 'Shadows of Youth'. It was the first film to record live sound. Director KANG was happy he found a new leading lady. You were the only love of my life. Cut! Okay! That's a picture wrap, everybody! Great job! Nice work, everyone. Let's give it up for our cast. - Nice work everyone. - Good work all. Hey, where did Eun-shil go? Where's Eun-shil? Hey... I don't know. I don't know anything! KAHN Mi-hi? You can't be here, ma'am. There was an accident and... Unauthorized eating is forbidden during training... Hyo-jung. Get up. Please? Get up, Hyo-jung! Wake up, please! I know it was here... You must not look at mirrors during training. No! that's not me! For everything in the world, the cravings of sinful man, the lust, and the boasting, comes not from the Father, but from the world... You must not look at mirrors during training. (INTENSIVE TRAINING: FIFTH DAY) (Dong-hoon 010-7926-8008) - Dong-hoon? - Hello? Hyo-jung? Why is your phone dead? I've been so worried... Is everything okay? I'm so sorry... I should've told you. No, I'm sorry. I know you're at KHAN Mi-hi's yoga academy. Hello? Are you still there? Good luck. You can change your life once you awaken your Kundalini. How do you know about that? Huh. You kept a cell phone. Should I tell, or not? I'll tell. Only one left, now. Give it to me! I'm the only one who didn't break the rules! Give it back! Let go of me! The Kundalini is mine! Excuse me? I have something to tell you. Where the heck has she gone? Is that you, baby? (Wise souls dine in the morning, ) (beasts in the evening, ) (and ghosts dine at night.) (INTENSIVE TRAINING: SIXTH DAY) Where is everyone else? They have left, giving up the Kundalini. You're the only one who can inherit the secret of the Kundalini. There's only one day to go. She wishes greatly to meet you. But you must understand one thing. You must relieve your soul and make room for the Kundalini. Is someone there? Miss KAHN, I think you're the greatest actress. All lies. Miss KAHN, what are you doing? I can't lie. You said you wanted to be like me? Oh, yes. Just like you. I think you're the best. You will have beauty, and she will find youth again. (INTENSIVE TRAINING: LAST DAY) Now... your soul... will vanish. It is too late for regrets. You chose to enter this place. You're insane! KAHN Mi-hi is dead! I can change you into a whole new person. I will have youth once more, and you will be born again into a new person. I don't want to live in pain. I couldn't stand myself. That's why... All I wanted was to be like KAHN Mi-hi. I know you are in here. - Let me go. - Don't go... It's all lies. Let me go. Please, just let me go. This isn't why I came here. There was never a Kundalini. It's all lies. Lies... People foolishly seek an easy way to fulfill desire. Driven mad by beauty... Fools. You were all possessed. KAHN Mi-hi is the devil. She isn't human. Even now, she haunts me in all her beauty. I'm sorry, Miss KAHN. I won't do it again. I'm so sorry. I won't do it again. I will never die... For all eternity... I can't do it anymore... I need to get out. I need to get out of here. I won't let them get me... Call me when you get home. Hyo-jung. Are you good? Should I come with you? Bye. Are you okay? O soul, vanish from within. Goddess of beauty, I call to thee. Shine your beauty upon your servant.
