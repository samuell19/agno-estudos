- This land used to be some of the most fertile farmland in the country, though it's hard to believe that now. It's been years since it last rained here. The news called it an isolated cataclysm or some shit like that. Means the rest of the world went on living while we were left here to fend for ourselves. Suck the one necessary ingredient for life out of a place and life seems to leave with it. When the fields dried up and the cattle died, people tried to sell and the ones who couldn't were left behind. It only took months for us to turn on each other, and, oh, how we did. You can know someone your whole life, but the second it's you, or them, watch how you change. There's always been talk of who's to blame. Some people blame the government. Others think God did this to us. But truth be told, we did it to ourselves. We left this land desolate. - Did you find out anything? - Nope. They done yet? - Not quite. - Hide in the back, Ned, and make it look nice. - Oh, 'cause he cares. You think I wanna still be doing this? - Just do it. - I don't even know how to do this. Billy, get over here, help. Come here! Why don't you take your time? Come on, lift his head. Lift his head. What's the matter, you can't look at him? This is your brother. Show him some respect. - They shot him with a 12-gauge from behind. - And Shelly was with him. - Where is she now? - Gone. - Alright, from now on, everyone stands watch. - That means you too, Billy. - You finish his coffin and we bury him in the morning. Alright, go on and relieve your brother. - May you go in peace, boy. And may you rest eternally as God has willed you from our pasture to his. Would you like to say a few words? - There was a time when I might have cried out and said, "Lord, why?" Why me? Why us? If this is what the Lord wants, so be it. - Duke! - What is it? - I found out who killed your boy. - Who? - It's Jeb Turner. He's the one who pulled the trigger. Duke, Duke! - I've never trusted those bastards. You ride out tomorrow and you don't come back here till every Turner is dead. You understand me? Do you understand me? - Yes, sir. - Make sure Jeb Turner's bullet comes from my gun. - Yes, sir. What about the kid? - Leave him. I'll need him to stand watch. - You must be sad and lonely more than ever. At least you're here this time. - What, is that supposed to make it better? - Kyle? - Get down! - Did you get it? - Hard to tell. Get in the truck. - When I was a little girl I used to lay in the grass for hours and just watch the rain clouds roll by. They always looked so busy. Like they had somewhere to go. - My brothers are out. I only have a few hours till I have to be back. Shelly and Johnny, they were here two days ago and now they're just erased. Disappeared. Around here people either get erased or forgotten. They think it was the Turners. - Get to the house. Now! Run! - What are we supposed to do, just sit around and wait for everyone to die around here? I can't live like this anymore, Kayla. - How long our families known each other? - We just wanted the girl. - Where is she? - I don't know. We just grab the girls and they pick 'em up. We're all just trying to get by. - You shot him in the back, Jeb. - Enough blood's been spilled. - You shot him in the back! For what? No! No! And though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil. For thou art with me. They rod and thy staff they comfort me. - Those things don't work anymore, Jeb. - Go on. Get it over with. - Go check the property. - Look at this. - That could buy us a year, maybe get an acre in the ground. - Bullshit, that right there is the last green thing we're ever gonna see in this field. That gets us out of here. - Yeah, well, you're gonna need a lot more than that to get us outta here. - Look at this, I think there is more. Every one of these spots on here is a stash house including the Turner ranch. And these are all on farms where the drought affected them. Except for this one, this one's different. I think they're funneling stuff through here. I think this is where we have to go. - Go get your brother and let's go inside. - Where is he? - He's on watch. - Not when we came in. - I heard something out back in the field so I went to check it out. - Don't lie to me, boy. Where have you been? - I went to see, Kayla, sir. - You leave your watch and waste what little gas we have left to go see that little bitch? - Bitch. - Get hold of him. I don't think you understand what it means to be a Stone. It's not just a name. You need to learn that. - Kyle! Kyle! - Pull up his shirt. - Kyle, Kyle! - Hey, relax, it's just me. - Fuck you. - Fuck you? What? - Didn't you hold me down? - What was I supposed to do, Billy? - Didn't you hold me down? - What was I supposed to do? Look, man, I wanna watch your back. But when you pull shit like you did last night I can't fucking help you! - I don't need your help. - Shut your mouth and listen to me! Duke asked me to come get you. Do you know what that means? Look, you want out. I get it. Stop acting like a fucking kid. And start being a man. Don't put me in that situation again. Let's go. - Everything out here, it's abandoned. But this right here, that's the wild card. - Kent County. - Yeah. - How far is that? - Three, 350. - Well, how much gas we got left? - We got enough for one bike. - What's that gonna do us? - Look, I'll go. - You're not going alone. - Nobody's gotta go alone. We got enough gas to get us there. We'll just refuel on the way back. - Yeah, what if the station's dry? - Someone finds out that we got this map, it's over. - Who keeps that much gas around here? - A meth cook would. - I think you need to learn to speak when spoken to, Billy. - Shut up. - A meth cook would keep that much, sir. - He's right. They use it to cook their product. - Raymond. Raymond would have it. I don't like it, but, it's where we're at. - Okay then, get going. - Let's do it. - Take Billy with you. - Let's go. - You ride with your brothers from now on. - Yes, sir. It's some kind of job outside of town. - Where to? - Kent County. ♪ What you got goin' on ♪ - We ready? ♪ Keep those eyes closed, holding on ♪ - You think I have any choice over the plans? - Why don't you just tell them that we have our own plans? ♪ Don't want another ♪ ♪ Day to break ♪ - Billy, you don't have to do this. - I have to do this, okay? They're making me do this. - No one is making you do anything-- - Why do you not understand? You should be ready in a couple days and I'll be back here to get you, okay? ♪ Warm shadow ♪ ♪ Won't you cast yourself on me ♪ ♪ What you got in store for me ♪ ♪ You keep those eyes closed next to me ♪ ♪ I don't want another ♪ ♪ Day to break ♪ ♪ Take our, steal our night away ♪ - I'm sorry to show up like this. I know it's been a while. We just, we need something quick. Maybe you can help an old friend out? We're just trying to get by, you know, Ray? That's all. Look at you, man. You're the king here. - Long time, Ky. - Long time. - A fucking long time! And now you little fuckers wanna get in the game, huh? Okay. How you wanna get started? Eight string, oxtail, Lucy glass? I got it all, man. Oh, we even got these sweet fucking guns these chinks just gave us for some smack. - No, man, just the glass. Just the glass. - Alright, we got glass. We got good fucking glass. Why don't you give it a shot? - I trust you. - I don't give a fuck if you trust me. How the fuck you gonna sell my shit, you don't know what it tastes like? Good boy. Okay, just the crystal. - That's it, man. - They're really nice fucking guns, man. You sure you don't want any fucking guns? - Ray. - Baby, baby, baby, baby. - We're good, man. We're good, we're good. - We're good, man. - Oh man, no, you gotta check this shit out. - We're good, man, just the glass. - Okay. How much you wanna start with? Alright.

Huh, huh? - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait! - Ray, hey! - Huh, huh? - Ray, Ray! - You gonna fucking die, big time! - Put the guns down, put the guns down. - Fuck, man, I'm fucking with you, relax! It's from Carlito's Way. You know Carlito's Way. You mean you never seen that movie? You're missing out, man. That fucking movie changed my life, man. - Ray. - I base my life on that movie. Shit made me the man I am today. Fuck, Deer Hunter! You know you've fucking seen Deer Hunter! Have you seen Deer Hunter? Come on, even the little fucking shit's seen Deer Hunter, huh? Deer fucking Hunter, let's play, huh? There's like, two or three bullets in here, tops. - Ray, we're good, man. We're good, Ray. - Come on, let's do it. - Ray, we're not gonna play. We're not gonna play any-- - Oh, don't be such a fucking faggot! - Ray, put it down. - We're having some fucking fun here! - Ray, put the gun down. - Come on! - We gotta get out of here. - Ray, put the gun down. Put the gun down. - Fine, fine, fine. I'll go first, ready? Here we go. - Fuck! Alright, listen, everybody breathe. You stay here. I'm going around to grab it, alright? Everybody stay calm! - Did you see that shit? - Did you see it? Get the gas, get the gas! - Shut up, shut up, shut up! - Don't tell me to shut up, Kyle! Get the gas and let's get the fuck outta here! - Billy, Billy, let's go! - Remember that time he took us hunting? That thing swooped down and knocked him clean out of the tree. He was so embarrassed all he could do was just lay there going, don't just stand there, shoot the bastard! - You know what I miss? Haunted Gulch Lake. - Gulch Lake's all dried up. - Yeah, I know. It wasn't always like that. Duke had this old Winchester that he let us shoot on. It was how I learned to shoot a gun. You only had to set the trigger once. I miss that rifle. - That must have been nice. - Hey. I know you got the short end of it. But he wasn't always like that. And when the rain stopped falling and all the other farmers left, and the ones that didn't abandoned their children and their wives when they saw that they weren't gonna be able to sell, he stayed, and he sweat and he bled for his family. There's something to be said for that. - Alright! You get your fill of the good old days, hmm? I don't know about you, but I'm thinking about tomorrow. Okay? I've had enough of this story time shit. Parker, keep an eye open. - Alright, this is the place. Billy, lose your helmet. You post up right there and keep watch for us. No matter what happens you stay by that door. Where's the fucking money? Where's the fucking money? - Kyle, what the fuck is this shit, man? - Where's the money? - There's no one here. - Where's the money, man, you hear me? - Hey, look at me! Where's the fucking money? - Where's the money, man? You hear me, where's the fucking money? You speak English, where's the fucking money? - Come on, man! - Come on, where's the money? Where's the fucking money? - Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on! What is this shit? - What is this shit? Where's the fucking money? - Put guns down and leave store now. - Fuck this. - Put your fucking helmet on! Fuck! Way to go, Ned! Now he's gonna tell us! - It's gotta be here. It's gotta be here! Where is it? - What are you doing? Get back here! - I got something in here! - What, what is it? - I don't know, I don't know what I'm looking at. - Gun! Fuck! - What do we do now? - You guys, we gotta get out of here. Someone for sure heard that! Holy shit. This is here. There's gotta be another room. Look for a door. Look for another door! - I found a door! I need a key! - We need a key! - Hold on! Fuck! I got a key! Out of the way, out of the way! - Are they in there? I don't like this, Kyle. - Jesus Christ! - This is some shit, man. - Get 'em out of here. - Money! Look at all the money, man. Look at that! - Easy, I'm getting you out of here, okay? Was there a girl here? She has blonde hair, she's about your age, did you see her? - Come on, let's go! - Take a bag, fill it, let's go! - Guys, come on, we gotta go right now! Someone's here, let's go, let's go! - One bag each, let's go, let's go! - Take the shit, man! - Let's go, let's go! Come on, come on, go, go, go, go! Fuck! - Billy, Billy's hit! - Shit! Go, go, I got him! Take the money! I got him, go! - Ned, help me! Ned, help, please! Ned, wait, Ned! Ned! - Where the fuck is Billy? - He didn't make it! - What do you mean he didn't make it? - What do we do, man? - We can't leave him, we gotta do something! - Please, please. No! - Fuck! - Oh, God! - Let's go, go! - What are you doing, man? Hey, we gotta keep going. - Where, huh? We got no way out. This is the only road out of here. And they own it, Ned. Look at me. We gotta lay low. We gotta ditch these bikes. We gotta get some ammo. - Okay. - Parker. - Mmm! Now, that's a burger! When's the last time you had a burger, man? You ain't gonna touch your food? Come on, man, we did it. We pulled it off. Right? - Are you outta your mind? This is not a fucking time to celebrate. - Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? - You think this is over, huh? You think you're just gonna eat this meal and waltz right outta here? These people are comin' for us. And Parker is dead and Billy is dead. Okay? - Well, that's not on me. That's on you. You're the one who said let's go to Kent. Well, we went Kent. What'd you think was gonna happen, man? You think we were just gonna walk in and walk out? What's the matter? You got a little guilt on you? Hmm, hmm? - Where are they? - Couldn't take you to a hospital for obvious reasons. You're lucky, though, it was clean, in and out. I'm Van. I'm not here to kill you, kid. If I wanted you dead I would have let your two buddies finish you off. - I need to go. - Slow down, you're not going anywhere like this. - I need a phone. - Okay, there's a phone just over there. But you go slow or you're gonna split yourself open. - Please, pick up. - Head out to the desert, mile marker 201. There's three bodies there, grave's already dug. Now, there's a truck there and the keys are in the ignition. Clean it up. - You got it. - Yeah? I'll need the security tapes. What's the number? Alright, I'll pick it up in a little bit. Okay, got it. I gotta go. - I appreciate all you've done, but I have to get out of here. - I don't know what kind of trouble you think you're in. This isn't over for you. They're gonna come after everyone you know to find you. The only way for me to help you is if you tell me what's going on. Okay, suit yourself. - Wait. Hold on. - I know a kid like you doesn't get into shit this deep on your own. - We don't get to choose our family, do we? - Brothers? - Three. Two. - And the other two, they just left you? - Yeah. - Can't get ahold of Duke. - You any idea where they are? - No. - Oh, yeah. - Ned? - I always wanted to do that. - If you act like a fool and you call attention to yourself you're gonna get yourself killed. - You don't get to tell me what to do anymore, Kyle. We're not on the farm anymore. Understand? - I'm gonna ditch my bike and then I'm gonna bury my money so I have something to trade my life for. I suggest you do the same. - Oh, I almost forgot. I think this is yours. So, how much did you have? - Uh, I don't know, I was just the lookout. - Let's get you out of here. I'm gonna take you to my place. You hungry? I have to make a stop real quick and then we can grab something. You make sure you stay out of sight or we're both dead. - No, please, please. Please. - Give them to me. - I don't know. I don't know where they are. I don't know. I don't know! - If you lie I will kill you. If you resist I will kill you. If you try to leave I will kill you. - I'm not lying. I'm not lying. He was supposed to come back. And he didn't. He never came back, I promise. I promise. No! - I don't mess with bikes. What do you want? Sexy, isn't it? - Is she as fast as she looks? - Can't tell you how many times this sucker's gotten me laid. - Where do you get a piece of ass in this town, anyway, huh? - I would recommend the truck stop out on the 9. - Where's that? - It's about 20 minutes from here. Second exit on the right. Come back on the access road. Well, what do you think? Do you want it? - I'll take it. - You always eat up here with the crows? - No, first time. I don't know how much heat's on you so I'm waiting to see if anyone shows up before we go in. - Makes sense. So what do you do? - I'm between jobs. - You got family? - No wife, no kids. What about you? You got a girl? That is who you called, right? Never mind, I get it. - Kayla. Name's Kayla. - It's a pretty name. Is she pretty? - She's beautiful. - What, are you in love or something? Come on, you're just a kid. - Does that make a difference? - Would you die for her? - Yeah. She's everything. You think you can help me find my brothers? - That would depend. - They left me for dead. The way I see it they may as well have pulled the trigger. If it weren't for them I would have made it back to her. Look, I don't know how much they took, but I know it's gotta be a lot. You help me find them, it's yours. - You got it, kid. - Come on, get out, get out, go! - Kayla? Kayla! - Hey, hey, hey! Kyle! Check it out, man! - What the hell, Ned! - Look at the panty dropper! - What is this, man? - You said ditch my bike, I ditched my bike. Hell's comin' for us, might as well take a little slice of heaven before we go, right? - Ned, get out of here with this thing. You just wanna die, is that it? You're drivin' around in a blue camaro? You're my brother but I'm not gonna let you get me fucking killed. Is this what you do, you turn your back on your family? - Family? Look around, man. I'm the only family you got left. Get in. - Just get outta here with this thing, Ned. - We'll see you around, brother. - Come on in. - You mind if I take a shower? - Yeah, of course, it's right there. Oh, let me get you some clothes. Yeah, that should do it, here you go. - Thanks. - Yeah, I just watched it. Okay, got it, Route 9. Hey, I gotta take care of some stuff, I'll be out for a bit. Just make yourself at home, okay? - Okay, thanks. - Here. - Father didn't know anything. We killed him. - And the girl? - We grabbed her when we went looking for them. He'll come looking for her. - Is she here? - Yeah, at the restaurant. - Okay, I'll find them for you, but I want half up front, like the last job. - No, you do the work, I got you paid. - No deal. You think you're safe 'cause you took my fucking gun? I'll kill you with my bare hands! - Here. - Can I help you? - That's a Winchester, isn't it? - Yeah, what about it? - What are you doing? - Get out of the car now! - What, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Get out! - Easy, easy! - Go! Put the gun down, man. - Go, go! - Just take it, take it, go, geez! - Come on. Shelly? Shelly? - Ned. Ned, please! Please, you need to help me get out of here! Kayla's here, I saw her here last night. They have her here, too, the two of us! They killed Johnny in front of me-- - Shut up. - And they took me here! - Shut up! - Come sit down, you have to talk to me! - What are you doing here? Get off me! - Talk to me! - Shh, shh, shh! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up, shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up or you're gonna get us both killed! Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up! - This way, this way! - Shut that bitch up or I'll shut her up for you, okay? - Hey, how you doing? - Help you? - Billy? Whoa, whoa, Billy! - Gimme the gun! - What are you doing? - Gimme the gun! - Hey! - Where is he? Where's Ned? - What? - Where is he? - I don't know where he is. He's gone. - You left me! You left me, Kyle! - Billy, you listen to me right now. Ned told me you were dead. - Bullshit! Don't fucking play innocent with me. Where is he? - Billy, I promise you, he told me that you were dead. He said you got shot and you were killed. I swear to God I didn't know. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, listen. It's okay, we're here. We're here now, alright? The two of us are here. They shot Parker, he's dead. - I can't get ahold of Kayla, Kyle. - I can't get in touch with Duke either. - We have to give the money back, right? We have to give it back, right? - Listen to me, I buried the money. I buried it down at mile marker 216. We can use it if we can trade it. We can get out of here. I'm gonna get you out of here and I'm gonna get you home. I promise you that, okay? I promise. - Brother, we gotta go. Billy, you made it back. You look great. - You fucking piece of shit! You left me! You left me! - Enough, get off of him! Knock it off, both of you! - Oh, yeah, you gonna beat me? - Stop it! We're taking the money back, Ned. We're taking the money back. Me and Billy, we're getting out of here. You do what you want, but we're gettin' out of here. - Mm-mm. You're just gonna leave me? - You do what you want, Ned. - No, I'm doing what I want now. Now I'm doing what I want! - Alright. - Here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna take the money and we're gonna get out of here. Okay, just us three. Just one big family. - I'm taking it back. I'm taking Billy. - Don't move, don't. Don't move. - I'm taking Billy. - Stop moving, man. Stop moving right now. - I'm taking Billy and we're going home. Okay, I'm taking Billy and we're going home. It's okay, don't do this. - No, it's not okay. - I'm taking Billy-- - Get away from that rifle, Kyle. - We're going home, that's it. - Watch your hands. - I'm taking Billy. - No! - No, no, no! - We're gonna go, now. Hit the door. - Here to pick up the girl. - Please, don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me! - It's okay, it's okay. Take it easy, I'm not gonna hurt you. - Pretty sweet ride, huh? Listen, what happened with Kyle was an accident, Billy. Okay? - You shot him in the heart, Ned. - They have Kayla, Billy. Just take me to the money and I'll take you to her, okay? Alright? - There's a car out back, I want you to take it. You're gonna head out on the old highway. When you pass the power lines you're gonna make a right on a dirt road. You're gonna follow that dirt road all the way till it dead ends. There's a farm house there. I want you to pull the car inside and wait. And you don't stop for anybody, okay? You go. Not a minute to spare. Okay, let's go get our money. - I'm sorry, Van. I should have said-- No! - Where is it, hmm? - I'm almost there, okay? He told me it was here, alright? - Come on, come on. We're gonna get this money. We're gonna find a new life, me and you. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay, Billy. Everything's gonna be fine. You got it? - Yeah, yeah, it's right here! - Show me. - Yeah. - Show me! Show me now. - Bye, Ned. - Win. I found the brothers. - When someone I regard as not friend or family has seen my face it means one of us is coming to our end. Where is my money? - The kid isn't here. Where's the money? - It was right there. I think the kid must have taken it. Wait, just hang on a second, okay? He's gonna be back soon. Probably just didn't want to stay in here with the money by himself. You wanna make sure I'm not lying? - I believe you are telling the truth. I just don't care anymore. - I got Kayla. - What? - I got her, she's somewhere safe. You wanted your brothers? I did you one better. - Alright, come on, let's go, come on. - Okay, easy kid. Easy, kid. - You work for them? - Does it look like I work for them? I work for myself. - Okay, so what, you just wanted to help me, then? - Help each other. - How do I believe that? - Do you have a choice? In there. - Honk the horn. Honk it again. Kayla!
