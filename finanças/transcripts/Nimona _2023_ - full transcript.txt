A long, long time ago, a kingdom lived in peace... believing they had nothing to fear. But lurking in the shadows was a great and terrible evil. The monster attacked without warning, laying waste to everything and everyone in its path. But in that darkest hour, a hero rose up. Her name was Gloreth. Go back to the shadows from whence you came! Gloreth vowed that her people would never be vulnerable again. So she trained an elite force of knights and decreed that their descendants would protect the kingdom for generations to come. But if you want a happily ever after, you can never let your guard down because the monsters are always out there. Good evening, folks. We are coming to you live from the Glorodome. - I'm Nate Knight. - I'm Alamzapam Davis. And tonight's the night we knight the knights! - Ain't that right, Pam? - It sure is, Nate. But this is also the most controversial knighting ceremony in a thousand years. You can feel the excitement and the tension. - Come on! It's starting! - Tonight, tradition will be cast aside, and the kingdom will change forever because of one man. Ballister. The street kid with the impossible dream of being a knight. I'm here to slay monsters and protect our kingdom! Impossible, that is, until the queen herself made a shocking decision. Whoa... No, he doesn't come from a noble bloodline... ...but he might just have the heart of a hero. And Ballister made the most of that chance, graduating top of his institute class. A class that includes none other than... - Ambrosius Goldenloin. - Hey. Direct descendant of Gloreth herself, and the most anticipated knight of a generation. - Whoo! - Whoo! With Ballister joining the ranks, for the first time in history, our safety will be put in the hands of a commoner. I don't feel safe. It's not what Gloreth wanted. Ugh. I really hope the queen knows what she's doing. So tonight, only one question remains. Will the kingdom accept this knight who might not be right? Will the kingdom accept this knight who might not be right? All right. Aaand will Ballister be broody on the biggest day of his life? I'm not brooding. I'm just... I'm thinking. This is my thinking face. Hey, Thinky Face. Look at me. You were better and worked harder than all of us. You're gonna be a knight, Bal. Okay, okay, okay. But what if they still hate me? No one hates a hero of the realm. They're gonna love you. Like I do. My lords and ladies, the knighting ceremony is just moments away. Your sword. Your sword, and don't touch the cart. Okay, relax. Your sword. Hey, Ballister. Listen, man. I just wanted to say, I know I've always been tough on you, and I never thought you belonged here... And? And what? Did you think I was gonna keep going, or did you think I was gonna apologize for how I treated you? Oh, my God! That's hilarious. You're so stupid. I love it. It's so funny. Hey, everybody! Ballister thought I was gonna apologize for treating him like the trash he is! Uh, your sword? Ah, thanks. Hmm. Mm... - Um, uh, Mr. Ballister? - Hey, Squire, come take a picture with the real knight, not some charity case. High five! - Smack that hard. Slap it! - Can I just... - Cadets. - Uh... There is no greater calling than protecting this kingdom from evil. Never let your guard down, never weaken, and always be the will of Gloreth. - Yes, Director! - Thank you, Director. Thank you, Director. - Thank you, Director. - Thank you, Director. Ballister, today the kingdom will see you for who you really are. Thank you, Director. - Director. - Thank you, Director. Teacher's pet. Wait, what do you mean? You think I'm her favorite? And now the newest heroes of the realm! Goldenloin! Goldenloin! Goldenloin! My lords and ladies, Her Majesty the Queen. Here comes the whoo. Whoo! Whoo! Huh. I hereby pronounce you Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin, hero of the realm. Stand, Sir Knight. Here we go. I've been looking forward to this moment. Thank you, Your Majesty. My people, starting today, any of you should be able to hold the sword - if you want it. - Huh? If you earn it. I've watched this young man earn it many times over. Your sword. I hereby pronounce you Sir Ballister Boldheart, hero of the realm! - Boldheart! - Yeah! - Boldheart! Boldheart! - Yeah! Boldheart! Boldheart! Boldheart! Yeah! Boldheart! Boldheart! Boldheart! Congratulations, Sir Boldheart. Let a new era of heroes begin with you. Ohh! Agh. Arrest him! He killed the queen! - Let's get him! - Yeah, he killed the queen! Some of us don't get the happily ever after we're looking for... ...'cause it ain't that kind of kingdom. And this ain't that kind of story. The queen killer is still out there. Everyone is scared. Oh. Freak! Not since Gloreth's monster has anything been so hated. - He never should've been a knight. - He wasn't one of us and hated us for it. - A commoner. - He's vile. - He's got no place in this kingdom. - He's a murderer. He's a monster. He's perfect. ♪ I'm a grrrl just like, like, like, like Like, like, like, like, like ♪ ♪ I'm a grrrl just like, like, like, like Like, like, like, like, like ♪ Ooh, yeah. ♪ I'm a grrrl just like, like, like, like Like, like, like, like, like ♪ ♪ I'm a grrrl just like Like, like, like, like, like, like, like ♪ ♪ Like ♪ ♪ Skip train, don't got a ride ♪ ♪ Red lights flash So we run and we hide ♪ - That was weird. - Hey, boss. Yuh! - Uh... - I love the secret lair. The garbage and the smell of sadness pull the whole thing together. - Wait. Who are you? - The name's Nimona. - And how did you... - Whoa! Yeah! Sick arm. - Did it bleed a lot? - What? - Did they let you keep the old one? - No. Let go! What is wrong with you? - Ooh! Can I have it? - What? Put that down. That is not for little girls. Little girls? Okay, how old do you think I am? I don't know. Ten? - Help me out. More or less than ten? - Not a lot of kids in your life, huh? You know what? No. I'd like it to stay that way. You have to go. But I'm here about the job. Job? What job? It's all here in my application. This is just a bunch of drawings. Very disturbing drawings. Oh, look, it's me. On a rhinoceros, skewering several guards like a human kebab. Yeah! Do you like it? I thought a visual aid would really make my resume pop. - What? - Up here. So, about the job? What job? To be your sidekick. To help you do whatever it takes to get revenge on the cruel world that rejected you. Shall we pillage a village? Lay low until they don't remember you. Then we rise like a fiery phoenix from the ashes to overthrow the government! Or we could just talk. The point is, whatever your dark heart desires, boss. Your sidekick has arrived. - I don't need a side... - Every villain needs a sidekick. - Wait, I am not a... - Whoa! Sweet murder wall! - Murder wall? - Are these your next targets? - That's not... - Who do you wanna kill first? - I'm not killing anybody. - This one. - What? - This guy looks extremely punchable. You're right. He is extremely punchable. No, wait. Look. That is not a murder wall. It's an... innocence wall? Innocence wall. Wait. Are you saying that you're not a villain? Yes! Yes, you are? No! No, I'm not a villain. No. Oh. What? Are you disappointed that I'm not a murderer? I mean, a little. - You know what? We're done here. - Why? The real villain is still out there, and I do need help. - Not from you. - Aw, fine! Then from who? The guy who cut off your arm? - Seriously? - It's complicated, okay? Have fun getting arrested. I am not gonna get arrested! Murderer. - Wanna get some lunch? - Yeah, I love lunch. You had to take the arm, huh? Ballister? Director? I'm innocent. I swear on Gloreth's name. I don't know how it... how it happened. We all saw how it happened. I feel so foolish, and... I trusted you. The queen believed in you. She thought someone like you could be a hero. And it cost her her life. Director, please. You know I love the queen. I love the Institute. Talk to Goldenloin. Can I speak to Goldenloin? He is as heartbroken as the rest of this kingdom. You won't be talking to anyone anymore, Ballister. Please! Please, just listen to me. No. I won't make that mistake again. Director, give me a chance. We gave you a chance. But I didn't do this! Uhh! - I told you. - Oh! Good Gloreth! Hey, boss. What? How... Did I know this was gonna happen? Because once everyone sees you as a villain, that's what you are. They only see you one way, no matter how hard you try. You gave it a good shot, though. I gotta hand it to you. - Thank you. - Don't thank me yet. - I still gotta get you out of here. - Wait. How did you get out? I know the code. Beep bop boop beep bop. Invalid password. After you. No? You could sit here for the rest of eternity, slowly watching your muscles atrophy, your skin turning to rot, your nails growing into long, curly-fry-looking talons. You know there's no toilet in there. Okay, okay, but I lead. If you see anyone... Murder 'em. Hide. If you see anyone, hide. Fine, because we're still gonna break stuff. - That's a hard no. - Uhh! Psst. This place should be crawling with guards. How exactly did you get past... ...them? They were like this when I got here. - Grab them! - Stop 'em! - Over here! - Charge! The One-Arm Club's about to get some new members. Get it? Uhh! - What? Too soon? - Murderer! He is a murderer... of fun. - Did you even have a plan? - This is the plan! I break you out, chaos, destruction, something, something, something, we win. The "old something, something, something, we win." Terrible plan. Better than your plan of, "Sit in the dark and mope in a room with no toilet." I was not moping! Queen killer! Knights don't mope. We brood. I was brooding. Oh. Okay, fine. You know what? Why don't we do it your way? Yeah? Murder him, murder her, murder everyone! Bal? - Ambrosius. - Gesundheit. Oh, nemesis. Nemesis? Queen killer! - Oh, look! It's Gloreth! - Where? - Open the door! - Not an exit. That's on me. Did you see the way he looked at me? He really thinks I killed the queen. Everyone thinks you killed the queen. - Snap out of it. - What was that for? I can get us out of here, but things are about to get weird. - About to get weird? - Promise me you won't freak out. How, if I don't know what's gonna happen? - I guess you'll just have to trust me. - Why would I trust you? Yaah! - If you don't, you'll die in this closet! - Die? - Now promise! - I promise. - Promise promise? - On my life! - Then say it again. - I promise! Wow. Even when you see the horn? Horn? You mean like a trumpet? Just promise! I promise I will not freak... Uh... This is the part where you run. Everyone get out of here! - Yeah! - Oh no! No! Stay away! Get back! No! This is not happening! Yee-haw! Oh no. Oh, good Gloreth! Aah! Rhinoceros? - Leave that guy alone! - Take that! - No! Not the stairs! - Ooh, stairs! - Whoo! - Not the stairs! - What are you? - I'm Nimona! - So, you're a girl and a rhino? - I'm a lot of things. What is happening? Ohh! Uhh! Yaah! - Are you gonna be okay? - No! - You promised. - Right! Right. You promised not to freak out. - Turn right! - Oh! Halt! Whoa! Huh. This floor is surprisingly stable. Ah, there we go. - Cold in here? - Uhh! Help me! Help me! You. You did that on purpose. You catch on quick, boss. Yeah. No. We've gotta get out of here. Whoa! No! No! No! No going down! No going down! Staircase! No going down! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! Ha! Ha ha! Oh, no. Something, something, something, we win. Metal. Oh. ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Can I get a witness, a closer look? ♪ ♪ Everybody itching For a throne to throw ♪ ♪ And you could be the widget To my turbo ♪ ♪ Better see your status when I go solo ♪ - Ah.

Wait. Wait. Last thing I remember, we were in a supply closet. And now... How did I get here? I dragged you for, like, seven miles. What happened? Your head bounced on the sidewalk a few times. It's all so foggy. Really? You thanked me, said you'd forever be in my debt, and that we'd always be best friends. Uh... Totally happened. Hey, I spruced up the lair. I arranged the weapons in order of deadliness, unchildproofed the place, opened the poisons laying around, and pulled some rusty nails one centimeter out of the floorboards. Overall, just made it much more evil lair-y in here. Evil Larry. That's a great villain name. - You should change your name. - Never gonna happen. Whatever, Larry. And I updated your murder wall. Oops. Plus, I drew up plans for revenge, torment, and good old general malfeasance. Rhinoceros. You look freaked. You promised you'd hold it together. You're not human. - You looking for something? - My sword. It exploded. Remember? You're a mo... What? Marsupial? Mariachi? Meatball? You're a monster. Do not call me that! No. No, no, no. Of course not. You're obviously not a massive fire-breathing, you know... But you do do the shifty-shift-shifting-shape thing. And you're a girl who can turn into... What are you? I'm Nimona. No, that's not an answer. People don't just turn into things. I do. Okay. Fine. Then I have a million questions. You get one. Why are you helping me? Because I'm bored. And everybody hates you too. The squire has to know something. He's the one that gave me the sword. The sword that... that... You need the squire? Then let's go kill... Get him. Let's go get him. You and me. No, absolutely not. The thing you do? It's too much. No. I think you're trying to say, "Thanks for saving my life." Three times, if you're keeping score. But you're right. I'm sure you can do this alone, with every knight in the entire kingdom gunning for you. Good luck. Wait. Yes, Evil Larry? - I... - I'm in. Here's the thing. When we clear your name, then I am your official sidekick forever. No take-backsies. Deal? - I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. - Don't overthink it. Can you just be you, please? I don't follow. Girl you. But I'm not a girl. I'm a shark. Hey. You ever put your head in the mouth of one of these? - Should've just stayed in jail. - Come on! You know you wanna! Oh man! Look at this place! A thousand years of history destroyed. - Huh. Hey, Mansley. - What? Your uncle's head fell on my grandma's butt. - That's hilarious. - Nice. Oh, so sad, though. Well, if Goldenloin hadn't helped him... - I never liked... - Let me get this straight. The murderer of the queen escaped with the help of a girl, an ostrich, and a whale? It destroyed our showers! This is his fault! - Tell him, Todd. - Me? Why didn't you tell us Ballister was working with whales? Whales? Really, Todd? Oh, what? Whale? Really? Yeah. You knew him better than anyone, bro. I tried to stop him, bro. Really? Like this? "Oh, hi, Ballister. Come right in." "And of course you can bring your whale, ostrich, and big fat unicorn." - Fat unicorn? - Yeah, you saw it. - One with the horn that broke everything. - You mean rhinoceros? If I meant rhinoperos, I would have said rhinoperos. Enough! There is a villain on the loose in our kingdom. Look at you, acting like common children. Remember your training. Remember who you are. We are born to protect this kingdom. I was born. Let me take the lead, Director. There's only two things I want right now. A, to have a really big sword. Check. And three, to treat Ballister like the queen-killing monster he is. - I'll hunt him down. - Yeah! I'll make it hurt. I'll make... - I'll do it. - Huh? Why? If anyone can find Bal... find Ballister before someone else gets hurt... it's me. This is the greatest threat we've faced in generations. Thankfully, we have a descendant of Gloreth to lead us. What? Knights of the realm, search every street, every shadow. Find Ballister, and bring him to me. After yesterday's vicious attack on the Institute, our knights have redoubled their efforts in the manhunt for the villain Ballister. Whew. Okay. We just have to get to the market and find the squire without drawing att... Will you be quiet? Counterpoint. Your plan sucks, and it's boring. Where's the drama? The screams of terror? Wait. Shh. We are villains. Embrace it. No. We're doing things my way this time. No one gets hurt. I was going for the "hurting people" version. - We find the squire and question him. - Then hurt him. - No. And then find the proof. - By hurting him. No. Can we just get to the market, please? Roger that. - Next flight leaves in three... - No. What are you doing? - ...two... - No... Boo! I'm a ghost. Heh heh heh. Eh, sorry. I can't be seen with that! Aah! This is quality sidekicking stuff. It's too much. Oh, unclench your mustache. What's the worst that could happen? Monster attack. Monster attack. Seek immediate shelter. Citizens of the realm, hello. In light of yesterday's horrific attack on the Institute, we are taking every precaution to keep you safe. Please do not be alarmed. This is only a test. Go about your normal lives and rest assured that the Institute has this situation well in hand. Good day and may Gloreth guide you always. Do not be alarmed. Please remain calm. This is only a test. Oh! A "don't-be-alarmed" alarm. Effective. Don't you get it? The second we let our guard down, something terrible comes over that wall. Have you ever even been outside the wall? Yeah, 'cause I have a death wish. No! No one has! So, maybe there's nothing there? You know what? We're going underground. Without the wings. You're gonna want 'em later. Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Go back to the shadows and... Hey! Aw! Next train arriving in three minutes. Remember, if you see something, slay something. You're watching KTV News. High five! After the break, "First Family Fashion," what the nobles are wearing this season. So cool. We're famous. You've gotta be kidding me. Ah. I love us. - Excuse me. I need to see your face. - Of course. So then an otter comes around the corner, and it bit me. A sea otter or a river otter? Are you kidding? Does it matter? It bit me. There's significant anatomical differences between the two. I don't know. It was... We're never gonna make it on that train without them seeing us. We need a distraction. Who has four thumbs and is great at distractions? Fine, but dial it down. Something inconspicuous and discreet, like... And she's gone. The queen killer! If you see something, slay something! It's Ballister Boldheart! - Boo! - Aah! Yaah! I'm evil, and I hate everybody! Not as much as I hate myself. Can somebody give me a hug? Baah! I hate smiles! - Got him! - I hate cupcakes. And I think babies are ugly! Hoo hoo! Look at this! I'm loitering, and I'm littering. I hope you all like freestyle jazz. Get him! - Hurry up! - Stop pushing me! I'm trying! I'm not pushing! I'm encouraging you forward! Well, do it without hitting! Our chariot awaits. What was that? And you never said you could turn into me. By the way, I can turn into you. Well, for the record, that is nothing like me. You're right. You're never that much fun. - We found him. - We found him! Look! All right, let's go. Let's get this gutter punk. - Yes, sir. - Wait. Let it run. Something doesn't feel right. He hates freestyle jazz. - You're letting him get away. - Keep playing. The clock's ticking. There. That's him. Where's that train headed? That's the express to the market. Arrives in six minutes. And we'll be there to meet him. Now we go. - Everyone to the market. - Yes, sir. "Everyone to the market. I'm a dork, and my hair smells like lavender." - Starving? - Rahhr! Kwispy! Then slay your hunger with Dragon Krisps! - Crunch! - Munch! Take that! All right, yay! Yeah! Dragon Krisps. Part of your heroic breakfast! Ecch! You've been staring. Did somebody want pizza? Can you please just be normal for a second? Normal? I just think it'd be easier if you were a girl. Easier to be a girl? You're hilarious. I mean, easier if you look human. Easier for who? For you. A lot of people aren't as accepting as me. Mm-hmm? How did you get like this? What? You mean awesome? No, how do you... I'm just trying to understand what I'm working with here. I'm Nimona. That explains literally nothing. No, you're right. You deserve a better explanation than that. I was just a kid. Cute, little, innocent me. I was playing in the woods, following the birds flying and the fish swimming and the deer bounding. They all looked so happy together, but I... I was alone. That's when I heard it... ...a song, calling me, leading me to a wishing well. How did you know it wasn't just a regular well? - Do you wanna tell my story for me? - Right. Sorry. Go on. As I slowly approached the well, a coin appeared in the palm of my hand as if by magic. And I knew what I had to do. I summoned my courage, held the coin tight, threw it into the well, and made a wish. A wish to one day be trapped on a subway with an uptight knight asking me small-minded questions. Do you still have that pizza? Now arriving at Market Station. Cool, we're here. Oh. And so are your friends. Uhh! Do you think he saw us? Yes. Go, go, go! - Move! - On the left. - Clear. - Clear. - Clear. - Moving! What in the name of Gloreth? Tiny whale. Whoa! Did Goldenloin see you do the thing? Seriously? That guy cut off your arm, and you're worried about being seen with me. - I told you, it's... - Complicated. I know. Look! Squire. Hi. Hi. Uh, excuse me. Okay. We've gotta get him out of here quietly. On it. Wait, not like that. Not like that, either. You want me to shift. You don't want me to shift. Pick a lane. And now you're a boy. - I am today. - Wait, no! - Wanted. Wanted. Wanted. - Excuse me. Come on. I know he's here! Find him! - Look, it's Goldenloin! - I can't believe it. Goldenloin. - Please move aside. - Can I get your autograph? - Just one signature. Who am I signing? - Do you sign skin? Don't move! 'Cause if you do, you're gonna miss out on a great deal today! Excuse me, Mr. Squire, sir. I can't find my mommy. She went to that scary alley over there. Can you help me find her? Please? Oh, no. Let me go ahead and pass this problem on to someone else. - There's no time! - Aah! This baby's fully loaded. State-of-the-art sound system. There. Can we just part the waters? - Thank you. - Thank you. Move aside. Please help me. Help me, please. A little demon baby is after me. Please help me. Aah! Aah! Check this out. With our 360-degree dashcams, you'll always see what's coming. And our news feature will keep you up to date with the kingdom's headlines. - Uh, you look a lot like... - I'm innocent! Help! No! Pineapple on pizza? Bleah! - There! - Excuse me. I need to get through. Move! - Uh-oh. - Ah ha ha ha! - Aw. Why did you get to kill him? - He's not dead. I hope. - Is that Ballister? - It's the queen killer! - He's working with a demon baby! - I thought he ate babies! Ballister! Stop! Halt - Yeah! - Get in! - Bal! - Shoot him in the face! What are you doing? We'll take it. Aah! Dang it! I hate to say it, but you make a pretty good bad guy. Oh! Yep. I like it. We're gonna shake this dude down in this sketchy part of town. Look, let's just question the squire and get out... Your leg. - Huh? - There's an arrow in your leg! - Oh. - Okay, you really need to sit down. - No, it's fine. It's totally... - Look at you. You're not fine. - It's a splinter. It'll work itself out. - You're bleeding. Sit. We're just gonna take a look, okay? Yah! Okay. Okay. Okay. That's... It's... That's in there. Uh, everything's fine. We're just gonna... We're gonna do this on three. You ready? One, two, three. Okay, most people scream at that part. I'm not a people. Right. Right. Um... - does it hurt at all? - It does. But I've been through worse. What does it feel like? Pretty stabby in my leg region. No. No. The shape shifting. Does it hurt, or does it... Sorry. Small-minded question. Hold still. Honestly? I feel worse when I don't do it. Like my insides are itchy. You know that second right before you sneeze? That's close to it. Then I shape-shift, and I'm free. What if you held it in? If you didn't shape-shift? - I'd die. - Good Gloreth, that's horrible! Don't be so gullible. I wouldn't die die. I just sure wouldn't be living. So nice to hear you guys bonding. Ah, it's such a shame I have to go. Let me go. Oh yeah, the punk in the trunk. Let's go dunk on the punk in the trunk. - Start talking. - He wants blood. - Blood? - Your blood! - I don't want blood. - Buckets of blood! What I want is answers, so start talking. Or we start stabbing. - No stabbing. - Slapping. No! Why did you set me up? - I didn't. - Then who? - You! - No! - Who? - Let me explain. Blanche? Chad? Todd? - Todd? - Punchable face guy? Of course. Todd swapped my sword, didn't he? - What? No. - Why are you protecting him? Who'd protect Todd? Guess we're just gonna have to do things the hard way. Hard way? Hold on a second. Wait. Just wait. Peekaboo. Yaah! Here, look. Check it out. I'm in the locker room, and you are looking at history in the making. Ballister's armor. It's speaking. It's saying, "Respect me. Protect me. Put me on. No one's watching." Awkward. Oh, we can just fast-forward. Okay, this is the part you have to see. The Director set me up. She killed the queen. I, I didn't know what to do. I tried to show you before... None of this makes sense. Oh. Hey, buddy. I'm sorry for kidnapping you. It's okay. - Or am I? - Oh! Oh! Ha ha! Look, boss, you got betrayed by someone you trusted. I get it. It sucks. But we did it. You're innocent, and we have the proof. - Once we upload that video... - We're not. What? Everybody needs to know the truth. The system is jacked. The Institute needs to shut down. Will you be quiet? Prospective target. Clear on Avenue Three. Over. I will not be quiet about this. This video could damage people's faith in the Institute. No duh! Look, I don't know why she framed me, but the Institute's not the problem. The Director is. That's why I'm taking this to Ambrosius. - Who cares? - Ambro... This is the man who cut off your arm. Arm-chopping is not a love language! He didn't cut off my arm. He disarmed a weapon. It's how we were trained. Wow! They brainwashed you good. You think this stops with the Director? You should be questioning everything right now. The will of Gloreth, the Institute, the wall. What's it all really for? For protecting the realm. You mean from villains like you? Or monsters like me? Look, if we get this to Ambrosius, everything is gonna be okay. For both of us. Okay, fine. But when things go south, I'm breaking stuff. That won't be necessary. Is something on your mind, Ambrosius? You can talk to me. My mind? I've lost my mind. I've lost everything. The man I love, my best friend. Although now he's got a new best friend. What's that about? What else is he hiding? Who is the real him? Who am I? A direct descendant of Gloreth? I never asked for that. Now everyone expects me to arrest Ballister. If I don't, I'm a traitor to you. If I do, I'm a traitor to him. Oh, and on top of that, I chopped off his arm! His arm! Who chops off an arm? Because I was trained to? Arm chopping is not a love langua... I'm fine, Director. - Ma'am. - Stay strong, Ambrosius. The blood of Gloreth runs through your veins. - Ambrosius. - Knights! They were like this when I got here. You. Me. Ambrosius, the Director killed the queen. - What? - Another desperate lie. He's not a liar. Says the miscreant, whispering in his ear. Aw, thank you. I'm innocent, and I have proof. - He's got a weapon. - No! Not anymore! Todd rules! It doesn't matter. You shouldn't need proof. You know I'm not a murderer. What are you waiting for, Captain? Hurry before the whale gets here. Come on, man. Do the right thing. Who is she, Bal? What is she? Ambrosius, I am begging you to trust me. Arrest them. You wanna know who the kid is? Oh, I like where this is going. You wanna show 'em? I'd love to. Let's break stuff. Metal. Is that a gorilla? Oh! Bloop. - Give me a sword. - We need to get you to safety. - Aah! - Get this thing in the air now! - Oh! - Sorry, not sorry! - You see a way out of here? - Of horse I do. Okay, that was terrible. Stop that... horse? - We're going over, aren't we? - Yep! The only way out is down. - Horse! - Why are we always falling?! Ha ha! Told you you'd want the wings. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Okay, that was super gross. - Ha ha, I know! Well, if it isn't the golden boy. - That's the otter that bit me! - I can see your confusion. It has the tail of a river otter, but the webbed back feet... Did I ever mean anything to you? Or was it all just a lie? A lie? Says the guy running around with a monster! Don't call her that! She's smart, kind, and quite sophisticated. That guy just peed his armor! He peed his armor! And she has my back, unlike you. You lied to me about everything! Only one lying to you is the Director! What? You're gonna kill me now too? You believe that? Then you never knew me at all. Yeah. Now I'm gonna punch you in the face. Now, I'm no doctor, but this cast looks delicious. Boss? You think this hurts? Wait till you see what we do to your pet monster. No! Leave her alone! Kwispy! Wait, what? Hope you brought milk. No! Wait, wait! No, no! What? Monster attack. Monster attack. Seek immediate shelter. - Monster attack. Monster attack. - It's okay. ...immediate shelter. - Monster attack. Monster attack. - M-Monster. ...immediate shelter. Monster attack. Monster attack. Seek immediate shelter. - Monster attack. - Her! Come on! - I've got you, kid! - No! Stop! - Are you okay? - I don't wanna talk about it. - I know something's wrong. - I said I don't wanna talk about it! Hey, I'm just trying to help. I don't need your help! Did you see the way that little girl looked at me? Kids. Little kids. They grow up believing that they can be a hero if they drive a sword into the heart of anything different. And I'm the monster? I don't know what's scarier. The fact that everyone in this kingdom wants to run a sword through my heart... or that sometimes I just wanna let 'em. We have to get you out of here. We'll go over the wall. We won't stop until we find someplace safe. Okay, we'll go together. Together? Listen, you were right about everything. The Institute, the wall... Ambrosius. No matter what we do, we can't change the way people see us. You changed the way you see me. Didn't you? We can't let the Director get away with this. We shouldn't have to run. And you made a deal, right? We clear your name, you make me your sidekick. You can't back out on a deal because you believe in truth and honor and blah, blah, blah. All that stupid stuff. Truth and honor aren't stupid, but all right. So, you got a plan? 'Course I got a plan. Something, something, something... We win. Excuse me, but the Director isn't available right now. We need to talk! Alone. Was Ballister telling the truth? He could've said anybody killed the queen, but he said you. Why you? Sir Goldenloin, is your loyalty to this kingdom or to a knight who consorts with a monster? Did you swap his sword? Did you set him up? Tell me the truth! Ever since I was young, I've had the same nightmare. I find a crack in the wall. I yell out, but no one listens. And the crack grows bigger and bigger until the wall crumbles and the monsters pour in. I begged the queen not to question the word of Gloreth. Not to question what's kept us safe for a thousand years. But she wouldn't listen. Allowing Ballister to hold the sword was the first crack in the wall. And now we have a monster in our kingdom. Is that... I'm sorry, Ambrosius. Ahh... Ohh! So, yes, I framed Ballister. I killed the queen. Gloreth did whatever it took to keep the monsters out. And so will I. Ahh. May Gloreth forgive you. So, yes, I framed Ballister. I killed the queen. I can't wait for the kingdom to see this. You. Well, and my sidekick. Round of applause, ladies and gents. Was my acting okay? I was a little worried my last "Ehh" was too over the top. If you're looking for feedback, it was a little dramatic. You won't win any awards, but it was good. I've never taken a class. Really? That's a surprise. Not a one. Oh, don't forget your sword, boss. Eh, she can keep it. I don't fight for her anymore. You called me your sidekick. I did, didn't I? You called me your sidekick. And I regret it already. You called me your sidekick. You called me... We need to talk. Bad time? Come on, come on! Whoo-hoo! Yes! Let's take that pooch for a walk. Eight, nine, ten. Ooh, landing you in the Enchanted Forest, which is my domain. Cha-ching. 600 gold, please. My Scottie dog will not pay your tyrannical toll. He rallies the oppressed woodland creatures and starts a rebellion. Squirrels scale the castle walls! Bears batter down the gates! Letting chaos ensue! - I'm still taking the 600 gold. - What? You didn't tell me you could breathe fire. Oh. Metal. Best two out of three? What? Nothing. Hey, check it out. Whoa! A hundred... 500... 30,000... Seventy-five... The whole kingdom is seeing this thing. Well, I guess there's only one question left. What's that? Can a shark dance? Can a shark dance? Watch me. Still reeling from the monster attack, the kingdom is rocked by new footage of the Director making a truly shocking confession. I framed Ballister. I killed the queen. I framed Ballister.

Director! You're under arrest for the murder of the queen and for... Ambrosius. This explains everything. Zombies are immortal, eternal beings. There's no way to kill them. But what if they come for us? I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I actually feel bad for the zombies. - Stop. Don't. - Hey. Hey. It's okay. You're safe. - We're home. - Home? I like it here. Let's live here forever. - You have 30 seconds. - Thirty seconds? - That's a lot more than you've given me. - I'm here to save you. - You are so full of... - Hey! Can I get you guys something? - Nachos! - Nachos! Please. And hold the olives. He's allergic. Bal, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important. And I wouldn't be here if you'd stood up for me. That is not fair. - We're done. So is she. - We now go live to the Institute. - There is something I need to tell you. - Hey, turn that up. Citizens of the realm, that is not me in the recording. I know it looks like me and sounds like me, but it is not me. That was the monster working with the real queen killer, Ballister. They are trying to trick you. That's a lie. We are under attack by something that can take any form. It could be anyone. Your spouse, your child, your best friend, the person sitting next to you. None of us are safe so long as the villain and that monster are still out there. She's twisting everything. Ambrosius, I'm not the villain here. I know. I know. I believe you. I... I'm sorry for everything. For your arm. She manipulated you. She manipulated both of us, but together, we'll take her down and prove it to the kingdom. You'll be a knight again. Thank you. The Director can't get away... The Director? Bal, I'm talking about your sidekick. Your sidekick set you up. What? This was all her plan. All of it. She's evil, Bal. E-Evil? No, you're wrong. We've been wrong about everything. Wrong about everything? Then explain this. This scroll has been in the Institute vaults for a thousand years. Look at it. It's her, Bal. She's Gloreth's monster. She's come back to finish what she started, and she's using you to do it. But she's my friend. Aren't I more than that? We can slay this monster. We can go back to the way things were. - This was a mistake. - Bal, please. - No, I can't do this. I'm done! - Listen to me! She's using you to destroy the kingdom! - You know what she is. - Stop! - Why won't you admit it? You're in danger! - Why can't you just leave me alone? Because I love you. Ohh. I have not slept like that in forever. Why do you have your cloak on? Is this you? Where did you get that? Who have you been talking... Tell me this isn't you. You think that I would do that? That that's who I am? I don't know. You're the one who told me not to trust anybody, question everything. That's right! Even now, with this, think about everything we have been through together. I'm thinking about everything we've done. Broken out of jail, stolen cars, kidnapped people, manipulated people. I was helping you. You were using me! You wanted them to see a villain. Someone else to hate so you wouldn't be alone. Because you're not a sidekick. You're a m... What? I'm a what? You know what you are. No, I want to hear you say it. Come on, say it. Say it! Say that I'm a mon... - I... - Surround the place. You two with me. Your door is broken. No. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Ohh! - Stay back! - No! Stop! Stop! She's my friend! She's a monster. Surround it! No! Stop! Fire! Fire! Gloreth. Gloreth! Come here! Gloreth... Go back to the shadows from whence you came. came, came, came... - What are you - A monster. Are you even human? Just be a girl. There is no place for you! - Don't lie to me! - She's a monster. Don't you wish you were normal? Go back to the shadows from whence you came. There's something wrong with you. What are you? - Monster! - You know what you are! You brought a monster into our home. You should've stayed in the gutter where you belong. Now where is it? Do you feel that? I feel like the whole place kind of went like "wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba." No. It's headed straight for the city. Alert the Institute. And you. If that thing destroys the kingdom, it's on you, bro. Let's go! Ma'am, incoming report from Sir Thodeus. - And? What is it? - Whoa. - What is that? - What's going on? We need barricades on Avenue A through F. And can we clear the streets? These people are in danger. It's happening. Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm! Hit it with everything we've got. Monster attack. Monster attack. This is not a test. Monster attack. Monster attack. This is not a test. Monster attack. Monster attack. It's the monster! Everyone stay calm. Drones engaged. Look out! You're okay. Hey, Goldie. Watch how a real knight gets it done. All right, monster slayers. Let's shoot some darts and break some hearts. I'm gonna be a freaking hero. Aah! Out of my way! We need more firepower! This thing is gonna kill us all! Look out! - High five! - Bro. Get out of here! Get me to the wall. Monster attack. Monster attack. Monster attack. Monster attack. Monster attack. Monster attack. What have I done? The game that lets you be a hero. I killed a monster! I killed two! Come on. Let's go. Help! Keep them moving. Get everyone underground. Yes, sir. Bal? - Bal! - Forget the kid. Let's go. - Let's go! - Come on! You've gotta be kidding me. Ma'am, someone is turning the cannon into the kingdom. Yes, I know. I gave the order. But firing them will take out half the city. Innocent people will die. - And so will the monster. - But... What are we doing? You don't belong here! I don't know what's scarier. The fact that everyone in this kingdom wants to run a sword through my heart... or that sometimes... I just wanna let 'em. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I see you, Nimona. And you're not alone. Fire the cannons. Kill it. - I said fire the... - No! It's over. It's fooling you. Fooling all of you! Can't you see this is what it wants? For us to let our guard down! I see what it really is, and so did Gloreth! That monster is a threat to our very way of life! And what if we're wrong? What if we've always been wrong? No! No! Let's go! That gun's gonna kill everyone. Hey, boss. Be right back. I'm gonna go break some stuff. - Wait, Nimona. What are you... - It's time to rewrite this story. Nimona! Nimona! Go back to the shadows from whence you came! Nimona! Nimona. Come back. Please come back. Some of us don't get the happily ever after we were looking for. Maybe it's not that kind of kingdom. Or maybe it's not the end of the story. Over here, I'm free. - Uhh. - Whoa. Hey, boss.
