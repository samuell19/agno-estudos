A little weak on that G, weren't you, dear? Weak?? I had all I could do to try and stay with you on that chorus. May I suggest that the conductor of the orchestra is there for a reason. Suppose sometimes you try following his beat! Thanks. I would if you'd step aside long enough for me to see him. Step aside?? I have to be pretty light on my feet to keep from being stepped on. Strange how things change. I remember six months ago when you didn't seem to mind that I got a share of the spotlight occasionally. Of course, I didn't mind your having a share. But that was before our marriage, dear. ♪ THANK THE LORD THE WAR IS OVER ♪ NOW THE HEROES ARE IN CLOVER ♪ ALL THE FIGHTING FINISHED, DONE. ♪ WE'RE PREPARED FOR LOVE AND FUN. ♪ SO AWAY WITH MELANCHOLY ♪ LET US KISS AND ALL BE JOLLY ♪ WE WILL SING AND DANCE AND PLAY ♪ ALL NIGHT AND DAY. ♪ THANK THE LORD THE WAR IS OVER NOW WE HEROES ARE IN CLOVER ♪ ALL THE FIGHTING FINISHED, DONE.

One more peek out of you and I'll drag that chinless wonder out of his box. Charming, charming. This is a nice place to start an argument. I'll start anything I please, anywhere I please. Not with me, you won't. You're on my dress. On my dress! Why don't you get out of the way?! That's enough. That's enough! It wouldn't hurt you to flash a few of those smiles to the seats up near heaven. Just because you sing to the galleries. You bet your life I do! And remember one thing, when the galleries don't like you any more you're finished in musical comedy. I wish I were. Yes, I wish I were. Oh, I suppose you'd rather be warbling opera with a bunch of fat tenors. Maria's voice is certainly wasted here. She gave up a very promising operatic career to marry you. Shut up, you old blimp. In Budapest they understood about music. So, all those half-witted officers you used to scamper around with, they understood about music, did they? You'd be surprised how much they understood. Yes, I think you might even be very surprised. Don't wave that gruesome object at me. Pugsie, don't pull that way. - I'm not pulling. - Pugsie, Pugsie! And why not? Haven't I worked for her for years? Haven't I taken better care of her than her own mother? - Oh for heaven's sake! - Haven't I - Then why does she go on like this? Just to make me nervous? Haven't I slaved these hands to the bone? Make you nervous? Why don't you hit me? Go on, and hit me! I never hit women bigger than myself. Oh, be quiet, both of you. Now, now, now, now, children... At it again? It's no use, Bernard. Maria can be sweet enough when she pleases. Sweet to the soldiers in the theatre, sweet to anybody and everybody but her husband... I show you all the sweetness you deserve. That's it, throw it away. Throw it in the waste basket. My present to you on your 26th birthday. - 25th. - 26th. 25th. Oh, for the love of heaven, what does it matter? Oh, but it does matter. What if it is the 26th? Who cares? Who cares?! - 25th, dear. - Thank you, darling. And thank you for the nice notice. Not at all! Bernard, I am one of your oldest... I am one of your greatest friends. But even so... even so, decencies must be observed. When one's best friend is in distress that is hardly the time to wallow in popular journalism. I'm sorry to hear that you are in distress, Karl. Listen... - You may go, Anton. - Yes, sir. What time is it, old man? 11:36. 11:36, May the 8th. The unhappiest moment of my life. Oh. Is it as bad as all that? Bernard, you earn your living by pronouncing judgement on music and musicians. Let me ask you one plain and simple question. Has Maria a voice of operatic calibre or not? My dear Karl, the only way for a critic to remain friends with the people about whom he writes, is to mention no opinion except in his newspaper. Maria has a very fine voice. You have a very fine voice. And I am a very fine critic. Well... we'll go into that later. Here's the point, Bernard. She wants to leave musical comedy, and return to opera. - And do you know why? - Well, perhaps to sing. Oh, no. Our little Maria is not very concerned with singing at the moment. Bernard... Maria wants to leave me. She is tired of me. Bored with me. Oh no, that's incredible. I have proof of it. Unshakeable proof. What? The other night, Bernard, I happened to come home early. Yes? I went quietly up to her bedroom... Yes, yes, go on. There she was in darkness except for the moonlight... With another man? - Alone. - Oh... oh... Alone in the darkness. - Playing records. - What? Well, to be more exact, playing a record. "The Evening Star", from Tannhäuser. Tannhäuser? You mean she is in love with one of those opera singing fellows? Oh no, no, no. You still don't understand. It's not anyone or anybody. It's just that she is in love with romance! Oh, now, now, now, old boy. Just because you've come home and found your wife sitting in the dark, playing Tannhäuser, you... you jump to the conclusion that she no longer loves you. Bernard, I married a very attractive woman. My dear Karl, I am well aware of that. Yes, very much admired. Many men loved her. She has told us about it often enough. You've heard her. There was Count Shamolet Lieutenant Miklos, that fellow who led the orchestra, I can't remember his name. No, no, no, don't bother. I made the inventory long ago. There were nine. - Counting me? - No, no. Without you. Pardon me, without me there were eight. Nine. I cannot allow anyone to cast aspersions upon my wife. There were eight. Very well, there were eight, then. But even that eight we can't be sure of. The only thing that we can be sure of is that unfortunately, I was not one of them. I am sorry. I'm sorry, old man. - Don't weep over it now. - I won't. - It's all past and forgotten. - Thanks, old boy. Anyhow, this is what I am getting at. We were married in December, but our marriage was in vain. I am in for the same fate as all the others. He's coming, Bernard. I can hear his footsteps. Coming closer and closer and closer... Whose footsteps? The tenth! The ninth, I mean. Anyway, the new man. He's approaching as surely as the spring. - Rubbish! - It's not rubbish. I have lost her. I know it. You should see her eyes roam when she's in the theatre. You should see them glisten when she sees a uniform. Bah! I tell you, Bernard, he's coming into our life to take her from me. And when that happens, I'll kill her. What? - I will kill her! - Oh, really? Now who is that? There he is! Mr Lang, would you sign my programme for me, please? I enjoyed your performance so much! Please sign this picture for me. Wait until the girls at school see this. Rather touching, don't you think? Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mr Lang. Would you sign one for my sister? Oh, Mr Lang, you are so nice. Busy, darling? Come in, Bernard. It's rather late. Don't you think you ought to see her alone? No, no, come in. I want you to see what I have to put up with. Not a bad start. She welcomed you home with a round of applause. That's what goes on night after night. She's turning our home into an opera house. Well, goodnight, old boy. That's right, Bernard. Desert your old - your best friend, in his hour of need. Well, of course, old boy, if you put it like that. ♪ MON COEUR S'OUVRE TA VOIX [MY HEART OPENS AT YOUR VOICE] ♪ COMME S'OUVRENT LES FLEURS [AS THE FLOWERS OPEN] ♪ AUX BAISERS DE L'AURORE.

Ah, Klementov! I don't think you've had the pleasure of meeting my wife. Enchanted, madam. What a charming place you have here. I was just telling my husband - May heaven forgive you! - Madam is satisfied? - Most delightful. Oh, thank you, madam. - Mr Lang? - Yes? Thank you, sir. - May I? - Yes, darling. Oh really, this is too much. What next?! - It's Franz again. - Who is he? Franz Hochen-Spitz - old college friend. Always in trouble. You know him, Bernard. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Dear old Hochen-Spitz. Never out of mischief! What's the young scamp been up to now? Oh, he hit a policeman or something. Wants me to come and bail him out. Really, Karl! Your friends. - Let me go, Karl. - Oh, certainly not. I'll go. - Oh but, but I insist. - No, no, no... I think it would be better if I went. They know me down there, and... well, I just think it would be better. You'll be all right, darling, won't you? Oh certainly, dear. I'm sorry I have to leave you like this, but... I won't be long. Of course, I'm only too glad to serve you. But what's it all about, Karl? Klementov, when a wife is unfaithful to a husband, who is the last person in the world to learn of her infidelity? - The husband, of course. - Precisely! But surely that can be no concern of yours, Karl. Naturally not. I'm doing this for a friend. - A friend? - Yes, my very best friend, in fact. Bernard, have you ever done any bailing? Oh, a little, here and there. Any bailing that Karl is doing is in the company of that soubrette? That's ridiculous, my dear. Besides, Magda isn't Karl's type at all. Oh-ho-ho! So, Karl has types, has he? He used to. Well, I mean, anyhow I happen to know that at the moment Magda has... other commitments. Oh, how delightful. How delightful for both of you. Hm? Thanks very much. Messieurs et mesdames... My humble restaurant has been honoured tonight by the presence of a distinguished guest.

Thank you, monsieur. Ah, Madam. First it is that I sing to your beauty. And now I drink to it. Thank you. - Monsieur. - How do you do? You cannot deny to permit me to introduce myself... Vassily Vassilievitch Varanovski. Your humble servant from the moment I lay my eye on you. Allow me. This is Mademoiselle Maria Lanyi, and I am Bernard Fischer. Monsieur. May I sit down? Thank you. You have a glorious voice, monsieur Vass... Vassil-- Vassily Vassilievitch. You is what I sang to. You is what my... inspiration. Your beauty, it runs like a flame through my mind. Please, Monsieur, I... [Russian] Don't interrupt me! In Russia, a beautiful woman is happy to be told so. - Would you care for a drink, sir? - Always. All my life I hear that in this city they have the lovely women. Uh... say when. But never have I imagined that so quick would it be proved to me. I make you a confess. Tonight I go to the play, 'The Soldier of Chocolates'. I see you, I hear you. You are divine. - Monsieur... - When. I say to me, "Vassily, you must meet this goddess." So, when I see you here tonight, I am happy like little bird. And that is why I sing. How nice. How charmingly you express yourself. Cheers. - You have been in Russia, no? - No. - You know no Russians? - No. Oh... yes! Yes, I met one once. A singer like me? No. An officer in the cavalry. Ah-bah! In Russia, we have proverb... 'If a man spend too much time with horses, he becomes to be like the horses himself'. Mademoiselle Lanyi, I am desolate but I must go. I have the engagement. But... how quick can I see you again? Well... That's... not so easy. You see, I... I... If you saw the play tonight, you must have seen Karl Lang. - He is Mademoiselle Lanyi's husband. - Oh, so... He was here just now, but he was called away. He should be back any moment. I see him in play. He is very handsome man. Yes, and a very jealous one too, sir. With wife so beautiful, how should he not be? But the jealousy of the husband will not keep Vassily Vassilievitch from seeing you again. Now I go. What zoo do you imagine he escaped from? Don't be silly, Bernard. He is a magnificent singer and a great personality. Men of his type don't grow on trees. No, they swing on them. Ai-yai-yai! What a drink! What a performance. And how you liking it my friend? Magnificent. Even the orchestra leader insists there's nobody can sing like a Russian. Hello, darling. I'm sorry I had to leave you for a few minutes. Waiter, bring my dinner right away. Never mind the soup. You've been gone over an hour, dear. The machinery of the law moves slowly. That shouldn't worry a fast worker like you, darling. I'm sorry, Mr Lang, but the chef says there is no more shashlik. How would you like a nice cheese soufflé? No, I'm hungry. Perhaps a steak, sir? Oh, Karl, dinner isn't the only thing you've missed. We had the most unusual guest while you were gone. Is that so? The steak doesn't sound bad. And, bring me some boiled potatoes and new peas. What were you saying, Bernard? I said, we had the most unusual guest while you were gone. Some mad Russian, a singer, who simply forced himself on us. Oh really? And bring me a mixed green salad. A very handsome man. And he had one of the most magnificent voices I have ever heard. I beg your pardon, dear, who? Vassily Vassilievitch, the Russian. Oh, that reminds me, waiter, waiter! I want Russian dressing on that salad. Russian singers? Well, what's this place coming to?! They'll be having dancing bears next! Concentrate? Of course, I can't concentrate with all the noise going on in this house. Naturally, my wife must arrange the practising hours. After all, she needs them more than I do. Gracious me! The dogs! Flowers for Madam Lanyi. Look at this orchid! And these beautiful roses! Oh, but they're lovely! - Good afternoon, my dear. - Oh hello, Bernard. Exquisite! Now who could've sent me these lovely flowers. Perhaps Karl has been feeling romantic. Oh, Karl never feels romantic to this extent. Well, isn't there a card? Let me see. Yes. Yes, there is a card. I expect you'd like to know what's written on it, wouldn't you, Bernard? Well... naturally! All the same, I don't think I am going to tell you. Hello Bernard. You can take them away now, Liesel. Put them in my bedroom. Oh, Liesel... Well, well, well - spring is here! Quite a display. Orchids, gardenias, roses, A little ostentatious, perhaps, but pretty. Mmm, very pretty. You certainly have your admirers, Maria. I should hope so. And who is it this time? I really don't know, dear. There wasn't any card. Tell me, Bernard, are you going to stay for tea? - Thanks very much. I'd like - - One moment, dear. Oh, sorry! Are you solemnly assuring me that no card came with these roses? No, dear. Just assuring you. There is nothing to be solemn about. Oh no, Mr Lang, there was no card. That's a lie. Get out of here. Go on. You and your foolish face. Get out! Now we're going to get to the bottom of this. Oh, do stop talking like a deep sea diver. - Give me the card. - I will not! I command you to give it to me. I want to know who the admirer is that dares to express his admiration in roses. - Give it to me! - I will not! See there! Look at her eyes, Bernard. Look at her eyes. See them flash. Give me that card, Maria. Now, now, now... children, children. You keep out of this! Very well, there was a card with the flowers... but I will not give it to you. I do know the name of the man that was on it... but I will not tell you. The man who sent me those flowers does appreciate me, does admire me, does love me. So what are you going to do about it? - Kill him! - Oh. That's what I'll do. I'll kill him. You hear me? I'll kill him. - New tie, do you like it? - Yes, very nice. Karl, as an old friend of the family, all this is very distasteful to me. How could you forget yourself so completely? If you want to know who sent the roses, well, why don't you ask the florist? Why should I do that? Why should you?? A minute ago, it was a matter of life and death to you. - I know who sent them. - What? You do? - Well, who did send them? - I did. Now, now, now, Karl. In words of one syllable, kindly explain what all this foolishness is about. You cannot deny to permit me to introduce myself, Vassily Vassilievitch Varanovski. What? Last night? That mad Russian, it was you? It was you! Great Scott! Look! Look, here's a letter as well. My dear, give it to me. Listen... "Dear Madam, if nothing happens to prevent, "and you have the great kindness "to appear in your window at five o'clock this afternoon, "if you will pull back the curtain, "and look down into the street, "I will know that I am the happiest man." Just imagine! "I shall be watching from a cab nearby "and half an hour later, "will do myself the great honour of calling upon you. "Your humble servant, Vassily Vassilievitch." Isn't that just too romantic?! Darling, I have some unexpected news. News? Yes. It's a telegram from the manager of a theatre in Olmutz. - Olmutz? - Olmutz. He's in a jam. He wants me to sing there tonight. - Sing there tonight? - Mm-hm. Oh, yes, of course... it's Sunday. It's not only Sunday, it's for charity so I don't see how I can refuse him, do you? No, I suppose not. If I start immediately, I can catch the 5:30 train. Yes, of course. - And I'll be back tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow in the afternoon. - My letter. - Oh! In the late afternoon. And did the telegram you sent yourself convince her? - It did. - Then everything's fixed. - Everything. - That's fine. At five o'clock I leave here, go down the street, change my clothes and come back to my own home, for a special star engagement in the first really great and serious part I've ever played. The performance begins at 5:30. 5:30? It's almost five now. Hadn't you better hurry? I'm in a cab down on the street, waiting with beating heart wondering if she will appear in the window. Oh, come, come, old boy. You know she won't. Oh Bernard, are you still here? Hello, my dear, I've been talking to Karl. Yes, Karl's got to go to Olmutz and I'm going to miss him terribly. Yes, I know, it's too bad. I thought I'd take him down to the station. Forgive me, dear, for behaving so badly just now. Of course, I do. So generous, so sweet. I should have told you immediately who sent me the flowers, if you hadn't started bullying me. After that, well, I thought you needed a little lesson. So I did. What a brute I was! What a beast! Wouldn't you like to tell us now? Why certainly! It was old Dr Schultz. You remember, Karl? He and his wife dined here last week. Not very romantic, is it, darling? No, Dr Schultz is hardly the romantic type, is he? You'd better hurry, dear. Or you'll miss your train. Oh... there's plenty of time. Ah, five o'clock! Ah, five o'clock. Ah, exactly five o'clock. Well, goodbye, darling. Take good care of yourself, and don't forget me. What? I said, take good care of yourself and don't forget me! Of course, I won't forget you. You'll be back tomorrow afternoon. You're not going to Siberia, silly! The journey to Olmutz might prove just as fatal as a journey to Siberia. Now, run along, Bernard, and don't let him miss his train. Blokha... blokha... Ah-ha! Hurry, hurry! Oh, Liesel, tidy up a bit! For heaven's sake, wash your face. Wash my face? Pugsie... Pugsie? Do stop peering out of the window in that awful gloating way. Not a sign of him yet. Then come away from the window. - Really, anyone would think - - Yes, and they wouldn't be far wrong. I haven't felt so naughty in years. Naughty? Pugsie, how do I look? Divine, my darling. Lovelier than ever. I'm so excited, I couldn't be more thrilled if he were coming to see me. Why, you're trembling! - Nonsense! - But you are. Perhaps I am a bit nervous. No, you'll take him in your stride as you took all the others. The others? Why all Budapest rang with your romantic triumphs. Don't you worry, my dear. This Russian will be as clay in your hands. Oh for heaven's sake, be quiet, Pugsie. I am quite nervous enough as it is without having to listen to your unpleasant innuendo. Unpleasant? You might as well know that my romantic past in Budapest has been very much exaggerated. But all those lovers? My dear Pugsie, I had admirers. And if anyone was foolish enough to believe they were more than that they were welcome to do so. This is bad news. In fact it was a view I rather encouraged. You see, I had Karl to consider. What did Karl have to do with it? Oh, Karl is always surrounded by hordes of doting women. So, when I decided to marry him I had to put up some sort of show. Keep them guessing, that's my motto. Well, I am disappointed, I must say. That is, I should be disappointed if... - If what? - If I believed you. Really, Pugsie! What a monstrous thing to say! He's here! No! Well, come away from the window. What a man! How I envy you, my dear. He's coming. All the luck in the world, darling. I know it's going to be wonderful. Madam Lanyi is at home, no? No... I mean, yes. Take her to me. Yes, sir. This way, please. [Russian] Excuse me, if you please. Oh! - Won't you come in? - With much pleasure. Madam. I must pay 1000 pardon for seeking your personal acquaintance in this truly unusual fashion. No, no, no. I'm an actress. I live for my public. I avail myself of the freedom given by my profession. It spares us so many conventional stupidities. I am terribly happy, Madam. - And I was afraid - - Oh, but no longer, I hope. Won't you sit down! - Merci! - Oh, so you speak French. Really, how interesting. A charming language. You speak him too? Oui, mais oui! Then we both speak him. Da, da. Quite a coincidence, isn't it? - Da, da. - Da, da, da. Perhaps we have many common things, no? I feel sure of it. Do you collect stamps? No, I do not collect the stamp. You make a joke, huh? Well, we mustn't let that spoil our friendship, must we? From now on, no 'mister' shall come between us. To you, I am Vassily. To me, you are Maria. You don't think we are getting on just a little too quickly? I am quick. Ve-rr-rr-y quick. You would be surprised how quick I can be. Yes, I imagine I should. - Do you care for sugar in your tea? - Always! - How many lumps? - One, only. - Only one? - One. I do not think it manly to care for these sweets. That's what I am always telling my husband. He takes four lumps, you know! Even without sugar, the lot of the husband is sweet. You emphasise the word 'husband' so oddly. I do not take the husband too seriously. Very sensible of you! Do you smoke? Merci! These are not very good cigarettes, but my husband doesn't care for any better. These are ve-rr-rr-y good cigarettes! Your husband has excellent taste. You think so? I see your husband on stage. Yes, he's often on the stage. He's very handsome man. Yes. Many women admire him. You do not? Of course, I do. But many other women admire him, too. They do? That's what he says. He's very intelligent man. Oh, I wouldn't go so far as to say 'very intelligent'. But, at any rate, he's a very good actor. Yes, he is rather good, isn't he? He's ve-rr-rr-y good! I should like to tell him so. I'm sure he'd be most flattered. But now, of course, he is out. Now he is out, yes? In Russia we have proverb. [Russian] Which means, 'When the cat is away, 'the wolf will soon be at the door'. Oh, there's nothing like that about my husband. He's not at all suspicious. - No? - No. Of course, I never give him any reason to be. - You do not? - No, never. If I had wife like you, I would never let her out of the sight of my eye, the sound of my voice. Oh no, I wouldn't want to be out of the sound of your voice. I do not wish to speak now of my voice. How you like him, huh? I think it's magnificent. - Last night when you sang - - Last night I sang from the heart. Last night I sang to you. - My love - - No... sing to me again. - What? Now? - Please! What shall I sing? Oh... I think something Russian would be nice, Not the Volga Boatmen, of course - You do not like our Volga boatmen? Oh, very, very much. But... I think it's a little too... exciting for the afternoon. For me nothing is too exciting, even in the afternoon. But I will think of something else. I will sing you my favourite song. ♪ 'O, EVENING STAR' (from Wagner's TANNHÄUSER] ♪ O, EVENING STAR, ♪ SO BRIGHT ABOVE, ♪ SHINE FROM AFAR ♪ UPON MY LOVE. ♪ SO LONG THE NIGHT WHEN WE'RE APART, ♪ ONLY YOUR LIGHT CHEERS MY LONELY HEART. ♪ TELL MY BELOVED, ♪ MY BELOVED, ♪ MY HEART SHALL BEAT WHEN WE MEET TOMORROW. ♪ SO, TILL TOMORROW, ♪ WHILE SHE'S DREAMING, ♪ O, EVENING STAR, ♪ MEET HER DREAM, ♪ HER DREAM OF ME. How beautiful! You like him, eh? Very much. Why are you sighing? It meant nothing. You are waiting for someone to come into your life, huh? Someone who is perhaps, ve-rr-rr-y near? Perhaps. [Russian] Oh, my God! I beg your pardon. [Russian] Oh, my God! - I must go. - Go?! I can myself no longer trust with you. You are too beautiful woman. Too desirous. My feelings are flying away with me. Oh no, no, no, you must control yourself. We must both control ourselves. Sit down. No! Here. - You ask me to stay? - Yes. You ask me to sit on this intimate sofa by you? Yes. A lonely woman and a lonely singer... alone. That is the situation very dangerous, no? I don't know. But Madam, I am a very strong man. You think I can sit so near to you, a woman with such a warm blood and such a pulsing nerve, and feel only esteem and respect? Is that possible for so strong man? I don't know. I've never known any really strong men. B-b-b-but your husband... Oh, he is not strong. Quite delicate, in fact. You permit me to speak my feeling for you? Yes. Have you considered that carefully? If you give me time to think it over... I may not allow it. I give you time. I have thought it over. You may say it. Go ahead, go on. Since you permit, then I shall tell you. - This feeling is love! - Oh! I am crazy after you, I cannot put you from me. You think I can sit and drink the tea when I thirst for the touch of your lips? Night after night I am walking beneath your window like a schoolboy dreaming of you. I am mad after you. You are hurting me, you are hurting me. So, I am bruising this white flesh, huh? I am a brute, a savage. You want to know love, eh? I will teach you love. The wild love of a wild land. You shall kiss like the gypsies kiss. [Russian] Such a beautiful woman! What are you saying? What are you saying? I do not know, I do not know. Oh, Madam, how warm you are. How soft, how smooth - Oh, Madam, you are delicious. You are laughing. You like that, huh? Oh, you beautiful, beautiful thing. I wonder no man has ever killed you. You... you barbarian! How dare you? You do not like my kiss? That wasn't a kiss, it was a battle. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, humiliating me like this, hurting my feelings like this. You force your way into my sheltered life, take advantage of my kindness, abuse my hospitality. Is this your usual conduct when a lady asks you in for a cup of tea? No, no, no. Thrust your unwelcome attentions on her? Bite her?? - No, I swear. - Go! Please go. I beg your pardon thousand times, Madam. Now I go. Wait! No, I cannot send you away in this insulting fashion. I feel I have gone too far. After all, you are only a man with the instincts of a man. Yes. And I am only a woman with the instincts of a woman. No... yes... For the moment I forgot myself, for the moment I was dazzled. Yes, I admit it, completely dazzled, by your voice, your looks, your spellbinding personality. - Da. - Da. But I should've told you at the start as calmly as I tell you now, oh, please don't look at me with those great burning eyes of yours, that I could never deceive my husband. It is not my nature to deceive. - It is not? - It is not. So, you see, I must send you away. We must not meet. We were not destined for each other, you and I. Like the ship that pass out in the night? Exactly. You see before you a woman who loves her husband, who will always love him. A good woman and a faithful wife, no? Precisely! Goodbye. Forget me if you can. Oh, I shall never forgot you! No, just the fingertips. Enough! Goodbye. Goodbye! She is true! My husband will be out this evening. - This evening? - This evening. He's gone to Olmutz.

It's him. He's back. Maria? Maria? Well, what are you doing here? Is that all you have to say to me? "What are you doing here"? Is that your greeting, your embrace, your kiss? Naturally, I want to know why you haven't gone to Olmutz. I missed the train. Well, there's another in half an hour. - I shall probably take it. - I wonder you'd trouble to come home. If you prefer, I'll go sit in the waiting room. Maybe I'm in the way here. - Where are you going? - Nowhere in particular. Then why the perfumed bath? Oh, why not? Well, that's more natural. That's more like my sweet, loving, little wife. You're in a good humour, aren't you, darling? Yes, aren't we! I'm in a good humour, you're in a good humour. - Whee! Everything's all right. - Yes. Well then, what have you done with yourself since I left? I said, what have you done with yourself since I left? Nothing. - Weren't you bored, doing nothing? - No. - Anybody call? - No. - Nobody at all? - Yes... somebody was with me. - Oh? - Pugsie. Oh, that must have been nice for you. - Anybody else? - Mm-hm. There was a man. Oh, there was a man, huh? A man with a bill. - Witty as well as pretty, huh? - Thank you, darling. You know the gardener said something about hearing a man singing. Oh! That probably was Liesel's young man. The butcher boy. You know, dear. Uh-huh. But would the butcher boy be singing? Of course, everybody sings here. Hmm. Well... little by little your harmless questions have developed into a regular cross-examination. I can't stand it, I tell you. There was some kind of man here this afternoon. There are all kinds of men, tinkers, tailors, soldiers, sailors, rich men, poor men, begger men, thieves. Yeah, men in top hats, men in bowlers, men in caps, men in straw hats, men in shining helmets. It's the firemen who wear helmets. - The what? - Ooh, very nice. I've been deceiving you with a fireman. What are you talking about? How do I know? I'll ask Liesel. No, I'll ask Liesel. I'm anxious to know whether Liesel will guess that it was a fireman. Oh, so you've been listening, my girl, huh? I was just coming in. Well, then you know it was a fireman. Quite right, my dear, you'll grow old in this house. You're a good and faithful servant. Next time I open the door, I'll knock, so you won't hurt your nose. Was it our sly old Pugsie the fireman came to see? Has there been a fire? Look out, Liesel, I am coming through. A charming scene! I can't put up with any more of this. You are killing my very soul. Oh no, no, don't say that. You know how much I really love you. - You suspect me. - No, no. You believe these lies about me. You trust the gardener more than me. No, dear, I don't trust the gardener at all. You're only saying that because you know I won't stay with you a minute longer if you go on torturing me like this. No, no, dear, don't leave me. I swear I'll never torture you again as long as I live. Tell me from your very heart that you don't believe these malicious lies about me. No, no, I don't believe them. And you do love and trust me? I love you, dear. That's a good boy. And now I think it's time you got ready for your train. Now just wait in there until I get dressed. Oh, I can't bear to leave you. Well, you haven't got to leave me yet. What? No, I am going to see you to the train myself. - Oh no, no. - Yes! I'm going to see you to the train myself. I think the whole idea is a bit risky. Besides, are you certain that Maria doesn't recognise you? In this disguise, impossible! Nobody could recognise me. I'm not so sure. She is no fool, you know. My dear Bernard, I am giving the greatest performance of my life. - I fooled you, you know. - Yes, you certainly did. And you're a very smart fellow. Ha, thanks very much. Hurry up, silly, let him in. Keep him waiting a few minutes, darling. It will only increase his ardour. Where's he gone? I can't see him. That's odd. He's not at the door.

That was beautiful. You did not sing the song like that on the stage. But I was singing it to you. I know, and I am very touched. - But - - But what? I think how sad it is for your husband that he never hear you sing this way. Oh, do stop thinking about my husband, he's perfectly happy. Hmm. Things are not always what they look at. He's very popular too, you know. Women adore him. Naturally, he is, I am sure, a great connoisseur of feminine beauties. Are you? Oh, I have known many pretty little womans in my time. Two, three, seven, twelve - [Russian] But they mean nothing to me. They meant nothing to me. But of course, you meant everything to them. Oh, I don't know. But that need not matter to you, my dear. Oh really, this is too much. Do you think I'm going to sit here and have your cheap conquests flung in my face? Do you think you can make me jealous of these creatures you mention? These 'little womans'? But Maria... You dare to believe I really care? You dare to believe you can make me suffer? - And the worst of it is... - Maria... The worst of it is... it's true. True? No man has ever forced me to say the things you've made me say tonight. I don't know what's happening to me. You don't know what's happening to you. No, Maria, you do not know what is happening to me. - But now - - But now? But now - - Well... say something! - Say what? - Do something! - Do what? You... you should've known that I would burn with a great flame once you set me alight. You... oh you... I never want to see you again. Never. I never want to... never want to see you again. Never! Never want to see you again! Karl, follow her. She expects you to. Eh? If you don't follow her now, you'll never know. - What? - You will never know. Oh. And neither will I. - Maria! - Oh, no, no, no! We must be friends, nothing more, you and I. - But that is not in my - - Oh please, listen to me. I thought and thought all the way home and it just cannot be. I may be to blame but this must be the end. Help me. Help me with your strength to say goodbye. Goodbye, dear friend. Oh, forgive me. Oh, my dear. Goodbye. Bernard, come here. It's all right, it's all right. I am the happiest man in the world. She resisted me. Congratulations! So the husband wins, eh? Of course! Now I can throw off my disguise, and take Maria in my arms because I know she is true. Splendid! I am the happiest man in the world. I am the happiest man... Why, darling! No, no, no, no, no. Don't spoil it. Don't move. Let me enjoy it. A sweet domestic picture, and all for me. Well, dear, did you enjoy your trip? Hmm, did you? Oh yes. Pugsie, take his hat and coat. Pugsie, dear Pugsie. Liesel, take his bag and put it in the bedroom. Dear, loyal, Liesel. Your trip must've agreed with you. Goodness you look fine, doesn't he, baby? Oh yes. - You know - - Pugsie, order a cab. It's time we went to the theatre. My, we look beautiful. Are we expecting someone? Why, yes! My husband. That's a good little wife for you. Darling, you'd better hurry. We're due at the theatre in an hour. And you can tell me all about Olmutz on the way. And did you give a good performance, dear? - Sensational! - Ah! I never sang or acted better in my life. Ah. I never played to a more appreciative audience. You don't say. How did you spend your evening, dear? - Reading. - Reading? Yes, a book. - Good one? - No. - Quite a dull evening, in fact, eh? - Yes. Darling, how odd you're being. Olmutz is an odd place. It does odd things to people. So it would seem. Yes, a disappointing little town, Olmutz. - Not a decent hotel in the place. - Oh dear! Hairs in the bathtub, and the food was revolting. Oh, my dear, how you must've suffered!
