Every night her husband would disappear into the forest on his white horse, instead of joining her in bed. Growing increasingly impatient, one evening the princess decided to follow him. (Horse galloping) NARRATOR: There in the thicket, she found him dressed in feminine clothes, dancing and singing as if he were a woman. Enraged by what she saw, the princess took her sword and sliced off his genitals. According to the myth, from that instant, the princess became Goddess Mata.

(Indistinct lyrics) (Door squeaking and shutting) (Shower running) (Sniffing) (Birds chirping in distance) (Door opening and shutting) (Indistinct chatter) Why are you here? (Traffic whooshing in distance) I've always known I was a girl. I met a trans sister on Facebook from Mumbai. She helped me discover my true self. Four years ago, my parents went to India to visit the temples. That's when I ran after it. I survived doing sex work on the streets. It was also there I discovered my passion for dance. I want to become a true classical dancer. Then I ran in some problems with the local politician's son and uh, couldn't stay there very long, so contacted my parents to come back. Uh, it didn't take very long for them to find out. So I ended up back on the streets, surviving, doing the only work I know. Then I was beaten and left to die. I'm scared, I was very scared. And then I met you. But don't worry, I'm over you now. All I wanna do now is get that surgery done, go to Thailand, and become a real woman. And in six months' time, I'll have enough money to go. (Whooshing) (Knocking) What brings you here? Can I have whiskey? (Grunting) ANTHONY: Don't wait six months. I can't take your money. (Grunting) - Can I ask you something? - Hmm, go ahead. Why do you have these scars on your body? Who is that? Mata. ANTHONY: Which Mata? She was a princess who cut off her husband's penis, because he decided to go to the jungle to behave like a woman instead of coming back home on to her bed. After that she became the goddess for transgenders. Really? Yes. You know, in the olden days in India, after 40 days of special praying and fasting for Mata, dai ma, the holy woman, cuts the penis off with a blade. There's a special ritual called You know, only 50% of people who go through a nirvana survive. Well, for some of us becoming a woman is far worthier than our lives. Sometimes, I see dai ma. What do you mean? I just see her. (♪♪♪) (Grunting) (Kissing) (Grunting) (♪♪♪) (Grunting) (Siren wailing in distance) Anything else? Enjoy. (Traffic whooshing in distance) (♪♪♪) So this is it?
