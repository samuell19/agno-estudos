I'm coming. Relax, calm down. Don't be afraid. He won't hurt you. What happened? I can offer you shelter, if you want. It's not far. I might have some clothes for you. I think they will fit. Hungry? They're my son's. Let's eat. Take a seat. There you go. That's for you. What's your name? Take. Do you have somewhere you can go? Can I call someone? Your parents? I don't know what happened to you, but... I can't help you if you won't speak to me. You can sleep here tonight. We'll see about tomorrow. Good night then. Come on. Come on, come on. No, no. This way. Come on. Yes. Good. Are you going home today? I mean... you're more than welcome to stay. Is there somewhere you can go? You can stay a little longer, if you want. I mean... ...a lot of shots are being fired on both sides. ...a lot of shots are being fired on both sides. Riot police are shooting at the demonstrators. The demonstrators are retaliating with shotguns, handguns... So a lot is happening. Outside my hotel, in front of the entrance, at least ten bodies are lined up. Reports mention over thirty casualties. Activists are also saying that they were targeted by snipers, so the situation has completely escalated. Authorities are arming the riot police with heavy artillery. They don't use tear gas grenades, but real bullets. And that aggravates the situation. The demonstrators are shooting back with quite heavy firearms. Who's got this under control? No-one, really. It's chaos. I have to say it really gets to you. You get up in the morning, and the first thing you see is ten dead bodies, which are mostly young men who have been shot in the head. Yes, that's... In the hotel I'm staying at, they're saying there's a sniper on the root. So it is quite dangerous here. There's a lot of shooting going on. It's all getting out of hand. Our Father, who art in heaven... Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. But deliver us from evil. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Could we ask you something? We would like to ask you a few questions. Yes? We would like to ask you a few questions. Yes? Okay. Have you recently heard or seen anything here in the area? Something that caught your attention? Something suspicious? What do you mean? Did you see a young man, about 25 years old? Settle down. Settle down! Go away. Excuse me. What was your question again? If you had seen a young man, about 25 years old? Why? Because we're looking for him. Short, blonde hair. Slim. Around 5 ft 7 tall. About as tall as you. Yes? Well... This morning, we found... a body in the woods. A young man. And eh... we can't find his brother. So... we think he may have done it. You haven't seen anything by any chance? Or heard anything? Something that caught your attention. It could be anything, of course. A small detail. It could be important. No, I... It's quite deserted here. Not a lot of people come here. Precisely. If something happened, it would get noticed. No? No. I can't help you. And you haven't noticed anything around Robinette? Robinette? That's quite far. I don't go there. Sir, do you live here alone? Yes. Well... No. My dog. Are you alright? How can something like that happen? Yes... Well, you see... Thank you anyway. If you happen to think of something, we'd appreciate it it you contacted us. - Yes, of course. Thank you in advance. Goodbye. - Goodbye. To wipe the table. Thank you. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. We wanted to come and see you again. We were wondering... it you had seen or noticed anything in the meantime. No. No? That's a firm no. It could be... that you forgot something and only remembered now. No. You sound so sure. It's not that far, you know. What is it? Half an hour. - Half an hour. A half-an-hour walk. And you've never been there? I never go there. You're the only one living around here. You must have noticed something. I can't help you. If I see something... - What? What did you say? If I...? If I see or hear something, I will let you know. Sure. Alright. Alright then. Thank you. Thank you. I've been living here for 25 years. I never see anyone. I don't trust people. I had a wife. And a son. And one day, an attack... A madman with a bomb and a strong belief. The entire bus was blown to pieces. I survived. My wife didn't. Neither did my son. He was your age. So I fled. I thought I would be safe here. How wrong was I. Explain it to me. I give you shelter, clothes, food. I don't even know your name. I don't know anything. Why don't you say anything? Why don't you say anything? What were you doing there? In the fields? Half-naked, without clothes. How did you end up there? I can't hear you. Say something. Say something, goddammit! The police were here. They found a young man's body. Your brother's body. How can something like that happen? How can you do such a thing? Why? Why in God's name? Money? Come here. Hello?
