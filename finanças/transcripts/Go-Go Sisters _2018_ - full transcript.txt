My, it's time for school. - It's so bright! - Quick! Yes, I'm up. My! Come down for breakfast. Dad will take you to school on his way to work. It's okay. I'll eat at school. I'm bored with the same food every day. Sorry, honey, can I take breakfast to go? I have an early meeting today. Here's my gift for your mother. Please tell her I'm sorry, that I couldn't make it to the hospital. Okay. Honey. My, take this with you. Should I? I'll look weird with that. But street food is dirty. Mom, I'm off to school. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Yes. On the 17th of November, US President Bill Clinton and the First lady Hillary will pay an official visit to Vietnam. This will be the first official visit of the leader of the US to Vietnam. This is 25 years after the end of the war. As a great contributor to the normalization of the relationship with Vietnam and by removing the economic embargo, this coming visit of President Bill Clinton promises much potential for the diplomatic relationship between the two countries, especially after the bilateral commercial pact was signed in July. On this visit, President Bill Clinton will have a meeting with Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong... Time flies. My granddaughter was just a little girl then, now she's in high school. I heard she even has a boyfriend. Kids now are very different from us. Mom, how are you? - Hello, ma'am. - Here you are. Hey, Hieu Phuong. If your mother hadn't told me, I wouldn't have guessed that you were over 40 years old. You look just like a 30-year-old. Oh, what are you bringing today? You have an awesome son-in-law! Working on an ocean liner is the best. My husband just got back from a business trip to Japan. He got you and the ladies something. - Thank you. - Thank you. He is successful and a very nice guy. He's just away often. I guess he's too busy to come to see me, huh? Yes, he has meetings at the port today, Mom. - It smells like a foreign country. - Right, it does smell imported. What is this? A radio? It's both a radio and a cassette. Thanh has already put a tape in here. It uses batteries, so there's no need to plug it in. There are earphones, too. When you want to listen to something late at night, just put on the earphones, you won't bother anybody. You see, in this modern time, everything gets smaller, only the kids get bigger. Yes, that's right. Honey. How do I turn it on? Let me do it for you. - Wow, a tiny machine but it sounds good! - That's right! My grandson also has exactly the same machine, but it's more expensive. Hoang My Dung. HOANG MY DUNG (DUNG, THE BIG SISTER) Is anybody here? Who are you looking for? Now you speak with a perfect Southern accent, Phuong Phan Ri. Well, I have to blend in. What did the doctor say? Two more months. Dung. You are strong. You'll get through this. You are Dung, the Big Sister. Big sister bullshit. Just a kid's name. At least talking to you is better than those grumpy old doctors. Does it hurt a lot? It's like a thousand needles, sticking into your body at the same time. It's cancer. My hair will slowly fall off. Get a wig then. You're still beautiful, Dung. Everything falls off. You can't fake all of them. Phuong. Yes? You are still as cute as before. Nobody uses the word cute for an over 40-year-old woman. My daughter is in high school now. I want to be like you. Hello. Yes. I'm in the hospital. Okay, I'll come home soon. Yes. My husband. He's going on a business trip for two months. You should go home to your husband. Dung. I will come see you often. What do you want to eat? I see that you are quite wealthy and happy. I'm happy for you. Don't worry about me. I won't be here long. Where are you going? Home. The doctors gave up. Dung! What can I do for you now? Just seeing you again is very fortunate for me. Go home. Your husband is waiting. - Phuong. - What? I miss them. Who? The Wild Horses. Please remember to take the vitamins and take care of yourself. Okay. I still have money. I know but this is just in case of an emergency. I gave Phuong My some already. You take care of yourself too and look after Phuong My. Teenagers are complicated. Yes. Spend more time with your friend. She needs you now. I will. Goodbye. Mr. Minh, please stop the car, I want to take a walk. Oh, sorry. Hey! Watch where you walk! Wow! Cheer up! - Shit! Pregnant Lan is coming. - Shit, where's my stuff? Attention, class! At ease, class! Who is burying her face on that desk? She's in the toilet, ma'am. Well done, Lan Chi. How can you speak while sleeping? I'm not sleeping, ma'am. I'm just taking a quick rest. You have to exercise a lot to burn off all the fat in your body. I mean, to burn off all the extra weight on your body. Anyway, I want to introduce a newcomer to our class. Where is the newcomer, ma'am? Come in, please. This is Huynh Hai Phuong. - Ma'am. - Yes? It's Hieu, not Hai. This is Huynh Hieu Phuong. Huynh Hieu Phuong comes from? Where are you from? Well, you should just introduce yourself to your classmates, huh? Hello everybody. My name is Huynh Hieu Phuong. I'm 15 years old. I started school one year earlier than normal. My parents are from Thai Binh, then they moved to Quang Binh. I was born in Phan Ri. Then I moved here from Phan Ri. Please support me. Country girl! Tuyet Anh, don't say that about your classmate. Actually, I've never been to those places. Go sit next to Lan Chi. The big girl over there. Yes, ma'am. All right, today, we will study more about the poet Han Mac Tu. Open your books. Who knows about Han Mac Tu? Why is there a cigarette butt in the class? - Where, ma'am? - Who smoked in the classroom? - Where is the butt, ma'am? - There. This is not a cigarette butt, ma'am. Then what is it? This is a cockroach. Don't be afraid, my baby. Why is there a cockroach in the class? - It crawled its way in, ma'am. - Who's on cleaning duty today? Whoever is on duty today takes the cockroach out. I'm leaving now but when I come back, the cockroach has to be gone, okay? If I still see a cockroach in the class, you all will be punished, okay? - Yes, ma'am. - Ma'am. Hey, girl! Phan Ri. Where is it? Do they have shampoo there? You stink! Hey! - What are you doing, buddy? - Buddy, my ass. Who's your buddy? Let me see if you bring cassava for lunch. I don't have a lunch box. Hey! Go sit next to the pinky princess over there. Hey you! If you don't wash your hair, stay away from me. But the teacher told me to sit here. - You're pig-headed, huh? - Hey! Are you bullying her? Piss off. Go back to sleep, fat girl. - What are you saying? - What? I've had enough sleep. Now it's time for some exercises. Do you understand? Go for it. - Do you think I'm afraid of you? - Damn these bitches. If you want to fight, go outside. If you fight inside the classroom, the warden will get all of us. - You go. - Hey! Who the heck was that? What are you doing? Piss off. Why are you poking your nose into my business? In this class, you have no right to speak. Piss off. Watch out. Who is this? This girl is Hieu Phuong. This is Dung, the Big Sister. Just kidding. The oldest. One year, two classes. Wait, one class, two years. One class, two years means you repeated a class? Hey, don't use that word. She doesn't like it. Don't mess with her, she has a Taekwondo brown belt. Hieu Phuong. Sounds like a singer's name, huh? Do you want to be a singer? Singer, my ass. Such a country voice, worse than you, Dung. What's wrong with the countryside? My grandma is also from the countryside. Oh well, the countryside. Hey! I'm Dung, Hoang My Dung. Hieu Phuong, so we are fellow country girls. Who did this? You can tell she is poor. Guess you only have one set of clothes for school, right? No, I have many more clothes at home. Listen, in this school, you've got to be careful. Naive people like you don't last long here. Oh, hey. This is a real cigarette butt, not a cockroach. Yes, it is. Someone probably smoked. But students can't smoke. So what? Country girl. Hey, look at Bao Chau! This is the first time she laughed without covering her mouth. Hey! What do you want to eat today? I'll buy you guava, yes? I'll take one coconut. Please no. - Just one, please. - Gosh! Hey, country girl. What style is she wearing? Look at her pants. Where is she going? I don't know. Hey, girl, don't mess with me. You. Hey, know what's good in Da Lat? Everything in Da Lat is good. Hey, country girl. So in Phan Di, you guys don't talk? Say something. Phan Ri, not Di. People pronounce it like that over there. Damn, why is it so complicated? R is pronounced the same as D. So how do they pronounce D? This is Tran Thuy Linh. Her talent is swearing. We call her the Swearing Queen. - Yes. - Yes. Damn it. I don't get to swear all the time. If I swear at home, I'll be slapped till my teeth drop. Your tit! Right, Phuong Phan Di? You're not really correct. Damn it, where is Tuyet Anh? Who is Tuyet Anh? She is the most elegant and the most beautiful girl in class, the Ice Queen. She only smiles once a day. It's when she brushes her teeth. But she is very hoity-toity, not nice and friendly like me. Can anybody get me some vegetables, please? Hi, everyone. Here she comes. Let me tell you, Phuong Phan Di. Sit down. That is Bao Chau. A future beauty queen, though she claims it herself. - She won't go out without a mirror. - Let's eat. But the good thing is that her family is very rich. The only film studio in Da Lat. - Celebrities from Saigon, - What are you eating? - Visit her house all the time. - Give me some. - She always shows off photos with them. - Thank you. Hello, everybody. Just reading your lips from far away, and I know you're badmouthing me. Listen, what's the point of envying me? Don't ever envy me, okay? In the future, I will give you a pair of tickets to the premiere of my movie, then you can take all the photos you want with celebrities. The photos of you and me now, keep them safe. They will be very valuable in the future. Hey, that's a good idea, Bao Chau. Remember to borrow a camera to take photos of us. What? Photos? So old school! We will shoot a movie. - Wow! - Wow! My family's studio just finished a movie, there's plenty of films left. We will make a yearbook on film. Yes! Ah, the newcomer. Hey, what kind of shoes are you wearing? I don't see the brand. I've never seen anything like this, girls. Well, these shoes were fine in my old school. Not in this school. No one wears anything like this. Your size is too small, otherwise, I could give you a pair of mine, so they won't laugh at you. Sit down with us, Bao Chau. No, I like to stand. Have you made new friends, honey? A few. It's lucky that your Dad was transferred here. And thanks to his very nice boss, you got to study at the most prestigious school in Da Lat. Study hard, okay? But in my class, they all call me Phuong, the Country Girl. And Mom, no one wears sandals like me in my class. Don't learn from those blood-sucking capitalists. Since the Paris Agreement was signed, the US has also been withdrawing its troops. Without the US backing him up, Thieu would soon lose his presidency. Eat up! You too, Dad. Stop serving capitalists like slaves. This regime will soon collapse. Authorities and the government now belong to farmers and workers. Where did you learn the disrespectful words of those communist students? Let me remind you. If you don't want to pick up a gun and go to the front, you'd better study hard. This family was able to move here, you two got to go to good schools. Thanks to whom? Do you know? Damn you, father and son! Can you let me eat in peace? How come you fight like a dog and cat during a meal like this? Father and son, fighting like two monkeys. Oh, my god! I wonder if you could prepare a vegetable meal on my altar after I die. My daughter-in-law. Yes, Mom? Da Lat's vegetables are so good, get me some more, please. I cooked a lot. Let me get you more. "Someone's boat moored in that moon river pier. Would it carry the moonlight back by tonight? Dreaming..." Someone read the last verse for me, please. Yes. Read the last verse. Ma'am, you? I? I? If you need, go to the toilet to relieve the pressure then come back and read! I can wait. Ma'am? Why do you call me up every class? If you don't remember other students' names, you can just pick randomly. All right. Because looking around, I can only see you the most clearly. Sit down. You, next to her. Yes. "Dreaming of one came from far away. So white is your dress, it blinds my eyes. Here in this land of fog and haze. Who knows if love will stay or fade." That's one hell of a dirty rag. White, my ass. - Hieu Phuong. - Yes. You always ranked first in your old school, right? Your school record even says you're good at drawing. So well-rounded. Listen. Sign up for the school's fine arts... course. It's free. Okay. Okay? And if possible, ask your parents to buy you a new white shirt. Quiet! Ma'am. How can I help you? Do you remember me? I'm Hieu Phuong from Class 11A1. You were our literature teacher back then. Hieu Phuong? Yes. There's also My Dung, Lan Chi, Thuy Linh, Bao Chau, and Tuyet Anh. The Wild Horses. You look the same. Your memory is still good. Me? I'm a grandma now. Sometimes I remember, sometimes I don't. By the way, Chi the Fatty visits me often. She always talks about the old days. Is that so? Is there any way to contact Lan Chi? Oh, yes. Chi the Fatty is somewhere in here. Oh, where is it? I'm sure I've put it here. Oh, here. Here is Lan Chi the Fatty. Take it. THE WILD HORSES PAWNSHOP It's here. Thank you, boy! Ma'am. This whole morning, I've been running around, I'm so hungry. I haven't sold any tickets. - Here. - Thank you, ma'am. - Your ticket. - Thank you, but keep it. I don't play the lottery. Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am, here it is. Jeez, just lend me some money. You've been checking them out for half an hour. How much do you think these jeans are worth? You've been gambling. And now you're pawning your jeans. I didn't gamble! I like this girl. It took a long time for her to agree to go out with me. I asked her to go see a movie. But I won't be paid for two more days. I quit gambling a long time ago. Pawning even these ragged jeans. What are you going to wear then? These shorts. Is 50 thousand enough? - Fifty thousand? - Yes. Okay. I'll give you ten more. Great. - Wait. - What? It's a loan. Come on. When you get paid, pay me back plus five. - Is it okay? - Okay. That's my Madam Chi. Generous Madam Chi. - Hey, you. - Yes? Remember. The first time you take her out, please don't get too touchy. Understand? I know, come on. Thanks for your advice. Give me ten more, please. Take it easy. Here. Thank you, madam. Bye. - Hey. - Yes? Is she 18 yet? She's two years older than me. - Impressive. - Wow! - Yummy! - Chi the Fatty. What do you have to pawn? It's Hieu Phuong of the Wild Horses. Phuong the Country Girl. Yes. Put me down. Why are you so classy now? Mom. Say hi to Mrs. Phuong. Hi, Mrs. Phuong. This is my daughter. Oh, such a cutie. But why does she look so skinny? Did you eat all her food? What? No! What's your name? How old are you? My name is Cam Ly, I'm nine years old. Good. Which grade are you in? I'm in second grade. A nine-year-old should be in fourth grade. This one, though. It's not because she doesn't do well at school. So why? She was born with a heart condition. Is she receiving treatment? Of course. The doctors said she needs surgery. But we have to do it abroad. There is no way I can afford it. Look at me. This small pawnshop doesn't earn much. Anyway, I work at home so I can look after her. If I send her to a school, who knows what might happen? - Chi. - Yes? Do you remember Hoang My Dung? Dung the Big Sister. I haven't seen you in 20 years. Why are you so skinny? And on top of that, you're dying? I'm dying so I can see you guys again. Bitch. You are always fearless. Sit. Tell me about you. What's your position at work? How many houses do you have? How many pieces of land? She's a business owner now. A pawn shop. In a working-class neighborhood. As long as you're the boss. When did you get married? After I left Da Lat for Sai Gon, I met a widower here. I am not sure why, but I fell in love and had a daughter with him. Hey! Pawnbroker. What's up? Why don't you introduce some of your customers to me? I can love passionately before I die. How about that? Yes. My clients are all workers. Laborers. But they're strong. The less they think, the harder they can get. Your pomelos are still in good shape. Let me check. Quickly. - Don't swing at me. - Stay away! Stay away! Stay away! Just say it. What's up? Here, look. I've brought a business deal for you all. What is it? Just tell us! So you want to find these women named Thuy Linh, Bao Chau and Tuyet Anh? Yes. Did they steal your money or your man? We can help you teach them a lesson. Can't you read? It reads, "finding our friends." Oh, right. "Finding our friends." They were our high school friends. We've lost contact for 25 years. We want to know what they are doing and their whereabouts. Did you go to school back then? THE WILD HORSES PAWNSHOP Don't talk like that to me. Hey, don't underestimate me. If anyone can provide me the correct information about my friends, then I will give that person a rightful reward, okay? All right. Wait a second. What if your friends are not here in Saigon or unfortunately, are dead? Hey, watch your words. Shut up. You still owe me money. I know. But if you have proof that my friends are dead, we will still give a reward. Gosh, how come this tiny shop has money to reward us? Yes, right. Do you see her? - You see her? - Yes. My friend. She's super-rich. Hey rich lady, turn around. Skip it. Turn around. Now. There. See? Her shirt, skirt, handbag. All are imported. It looks so foreign. You? Everybody. Look where I'm pointing. Do you see anything? Oh, a dog. You're a dog. Behind the dog. A white car. That's my rich friend's car. Wow. If it's true then, let's get around and find them. - Let's go looking for them. - Okay. - Oh, my god. - Let me hold it. Quickly move! If it's done, 70 for me, 30 for you. God. What? My! My bra, where's my bra? - You've got to find it for me. - Okay. - Gosh, I'm late. - Here it is, My. No, the one with the white straps. You got it? This one? No. The one with the underwire, find it for me. I'm late. Mom! Mom, where is my sweater? Hey, here. Here's your sweater. Hey. - It's torn. I'm not going to wear it! - What? - Oh, my god. - God? I'm going, Mom. Mom, you still haven't bought me a new pair of shoes? I'll go buy them at the market later. She's started to care about her looks. Your hand! Did you wash your hands? Why do I have to wash my hands? Just forget it. You're gross. The test was easy. I can't do it. Damn it. Have a nice weekend, class! - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you, ma'am. How lucky, I forgot my notebook today and she gave us a test. Lucky, my ass. I tried to write every single word this big, - but only got half a page. - Hey. See you later at the same spot? Okay. All right, bye. Hey, guys. So what's next now? Should we go to the meeting point? Why not? Let's go there. I've brought some tools. Why did you bring her? The more the merrier. By the way, let the newcomer see who we are. But I'm so hungry. You can eat all you want when we're done. Fight! Hey, Dung! Why do we have to fight like tigresses fighting for food? Let's be friends. When are you guys going to stop stealing from our class? We don't pretend to be panthers like you guys. We're lionesses. We're not just panthers. We're the Thunder Panthers. You hear that? Hear that? Hey, who's that kid? Why is she shaking like a lioness with a cold? Or did you bring a lion cub to scare us? Hey guys, look. Looks like she's going to piss her pants! Are you wearing a diaper, lioness? I didn't want to take her with us. But have you heard of the word possession before? "Possession"? Is it from Laos or Cambodia? You butt-head. Possession! Have you ever been possessed by spirits? Calm yourself down... Hey, are you trying to scare me? Spirits can't come in daylight! Her family grows evil wormwood. Look into her eyes. Look into her eyes and you will be possessed! I'm not stupid to look into her eyes. Hey, My Kim! You're such an indescribable animal with goggle eyes and a trouty mouth. - Your brain is like a jackfruit seed. - You crazy bitch! Stinky mouth! You didn't brush your teeth earlier? It smells so bad even from afar. Not as bad as your face with that trouty mouth. You look like you have two backs. Why bother wearing a bra? You fat ass. Hey, just say things about them, don't insult ourselves. You think you can swear? Fuck off. Cowards. You guys ain't no lionesses. You're just all talk. Come fight if you dare. We're well prepared. Come on. Hey, Hieu Phuong. Hieu Phuong. Why are you shaking so badly? You're all scared now? You shit-heads are all talking but have no guts. Even dogs don't want to look at you. Oh, my gosh. For heaven's sake. You are a dog, you dare to curse me? God damn your great grandfather. You petty undeserving kids and nine generations of your family. I came to tell you, you were deaf in your previous life, so this time, your ears are full of wax. Clean your ears and listen to your elders. Last night I was in your blanket but you thought it was bedbugs. You even cursed your great grandmother! You'll be dead no matter how you travel, by car, train, boat, or even walking. Your whole family, four out of four. What is "four out of four"? Four out of four means the whole family is dead. Gosh! People will never pay you. Eat meat, you'll have diarrhea. Fishbone stuck in your throat, you'll choke on water. You can't get away from me. Tonight I'll come to bite off your belly button, you skunk face. She's crazy. You dare say I'm crazy? I'm actually very nice but I can't stand you stinky bitches. Never burn incense for your grandparents, all you do is fool around. You even steal your parents' money. You girls are nasty and incurable. I can't stand your faces. On rainy days, lightning will strike you. If you feel cold tonight, it's me, coming to get you. Hey! How could she know I got bug bites last night? She also knows that you have pimples on your ass. How could she know? You little slut. Go home and burn incense for your grandparents. Or do you want your great-grandma to come get you tonight? I need to go home, my mom's going to scold me. - Fuck off. - Run! Hieu Phuong. It's over. Hieu Phuong. Were you really being possessed? Lan Chi. Why are you getting fatter and fatter like a pig? But I do burn incense for my grandparents. You burn incense but you didn't offer any cake or fruit. Give me some. Gosh, I'm so hungry. You scared me. Bitch. I'm afraid of ghosts. You overdid it. Hey! - But I have to say you're good at it. - I didn't see your talent until today! Listen, what book did you read to swear so well? Tell me. Well, because at home, my grandma usually swears like that. She swears so much that it's stuck in my head. Didn't think today it'd be useful. - Wow. - Wow! Nonsense. All talking. Come on, let's go home! I want to return to nature I want to live like a gentle flower I want to be a plant that is Happy in the wind, without sorrow I want people to love each other Without resentment or jealousy I want to live a life without pain I want to feel love like the first time Baby, do you see these flowers of life In this wonderful, beautiful moment? Like the happiness that is long gone Now we can't find that joy anymore Oh, my. Hey, girls. Who agrees to recruit Hieu Phuong as the new member of our group? - Agree! - Agree! Wow. No objection. Up to you. - Yes. - Yes. There are six of us now. We have to come up with a terrific name. - Right? - Let's see, how about you? How about Wonder Girls? It sounds classy. Gosh, no way. That name is definitely taken, I'm telling you. I think we should find a really awesome name. Six crazy bitches! God. - What kind of name is that? - There's only one crazy bitch. It's you. You're back. Tuyet Anh, please go have coffee with us when you have time. You always fool around. If you don't study well, you'll be enlisted. Go upstairs, the ground floor is ours Go! Enlistment, geez. Hey, Tuyet Anh. Go upstairs. Go away. Dong Ho! Have you eaten anything? I'll make you something. Can I have bread with jam, please? Go make it. Hello. Dong Ho, my family is looking for actors. Thanks but I don't know how to act. Oh, is that a newbie? Yes, right. This is Phuong the Country Girl. Oh, no. Her name is Hieu Phuong. She's just moved to Da Lat. You're pretty as a doll. - Wow! - Wow! You're like a doll. Hey, why doesn't my drawing look like her? How do you draw the eyes? Be patient, it will look like her gradually. Where? Hey, add more eyelashes. No. Hey! Practice well, you'll draw my portrait one day. This is for you. No need to be too polite. For you. I'm jealous. Why is there no gift for me? Cut it out. This is a song for those who have a strong personality, youth with rebellion and frivolity. The song is a request from My Dung, a member of Class 11A1. The song Wild Horses, written by Pham Duy. I'm sure you guys will like it. It's our group, grandma. Oh, is that so? It's late. Turn it down. But I like it. Tenderness opens up for them Wild horse can't help dreaming To forget the new wounds Wild Horses, so cool, so wild. I'll take it! But you are an elephant. I think we're elegant but not so wild. Why didn't you request Pink Horse? It's much cuter. The lady you're looking for is over there. Hey. Our Thuy Linh, is she so rich now that she plays tennis or so poor that she picks up balls for people? Or what if... She's now even older and poorer than me? Maybe she's that lady? No. That's not fair! Why is she acting like a teenage girl? Let's go in there and call her name, we'll see. Thuy Linh. The Swearing Queen of the Wild Horses. We are here to see you. Hey! Move, I need to clean this. Step aside. Hey, Linh! You look so different now. And you're acting like a teenage girl. Everybody changes. How are you doing? Me? I'm okay. Happy. I don't believe you. People can't change that much. Honey! Do you want to continue playing? Darling! Let me take a break for today. Just met some old friends I haven't seen for a long time. What the... That hurts. Sure, I'll go see my friends. Hey, wait. By the way, I should go buy new shoes and balls. I heard there's a new arrival. Bye. Bye, madam. Bye! So you're a sugar mommy now? How old is this lad? He looks rather cunning. Be careful. He might spend all your money then dump you. Goddamn you, fat bitch. Just let me do my shit. It doesn't harm anyone if I like young guys. As long as I'm happy, okay? Goddamn, you. Do you know how hard it is for me to hold curse words from spilling out from my mouth? Now this is really our friend, Hieu Phuong. Linh, I haven't been cursed for a long time. I'm craving it. Curse me, I like it. What the fuck? Goddamn you, fat bitch. My! What happened? Nothing, Mom. How come your face is bruised, what is it?

Not your lucky day, you walked right into our lair. Goddamn you, little sluts. You're faking it! I knew it all. I'm pretty but not stupid. You're such a country girl. Blindly following My Dung. Who does she think she is to kick me out of the group? She's just an older kid, who repeated a class. Kieu Chinh. Why are you hanging out with these punks who do no good? I heard your group has a name now, huh? The Wild Horses. Today I'll make you go wild! Hey. Give us some money to have our hair done. All right? I don't have any money. Search her! You don't have any, huh? - I don't have any! - It hurts! Hold her arms! Let go of me. Stubborn, huh? No one is going to save you! Behave or you're dead! Got it? Hey! Hey. A handsome face won't help in this case. Seems like you girls love to play gangsters, huh. So what? You should not linger around this place. Let's go, girls! We're leaving only because of you. But you can't watch her all the time! Watch out for me. Are you all right? - Thank you. - Let's go! I forgot to introduce myself, my name is Dong Ho. You really like music? Yes, I play instruments too. Stop there. There's gum in your hair. Must be them. You have to use ice to remove it. Your face is blushing again. Is it diabetes again? My house is down this slope. So we took the longer route. We could have just gone down that slope here. I just moved to Da Lat, so I didn't know the shortcuts. If you see those girls again, just tell them I'm your boyfriend. Wait for me a second. I want to buy two umbrellas. Thank you. Thank you. Take care. Bye. Love means longing for Loving someone In a lingering autumn afternoon The night wind is blowing Through bamboo leaves Leaves are falling, falling all off Love means rising feelings The wind is bending the casuarina row Making love moment, enamored souls Remember the night we were together Love will be no more The happy days will soon be gone Love will be parted Souls will be exhausted Spring will end, flowers will wither No matter how much we miss A beloved someone Who has gone to the far away Luggage is only the letters Old lovers, don't be upset Love means looking for pain With tears that can't be wiped away What to say when we are sad When our heads hurt I told you, my son is not home. He's not a Viet Cong! I heard your son was spreading flyers for the commies. Goddamn, all of you! - Hey, if you take the wrong side... - Mom! You sure will be left way behind. And you will never be able to live proudly. Remember that. - You will forever be ass-kissers! - Mom. Hope you don't mind, my mother is absent-minded. So what is this? What is this? This is the bread wrapping paper they gave me this morning. Yes, here! I have it here for you jerks! - Mom! Go inside! - I'll give it to you! I'm telling you if Khang comes home. - Tell him to go to the police station! - Go inside, Mom! - Gosh, why do I have a troublesome son? - A son like what? For God's sake! Don't move. I haven't drawn in years. Hieu Phuong. What? Is there anything else you dream of doing? I'm too old to dream. You can't live without dreams. Goddamn you! Dung, the Big Sister! Why is your tongue still so sharp after 20 years? Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry, Dung! Actually I've tried to quit. And I did quit. But I can't find a good-looking guy who's really into me. This jerk left me eventually. Not just that, he even lost my car to football betting! Yes, right. Hey, fat bitch! What? What were you thinking by opening a pawn shop? What the heck? Do you know how much I loathe that job? Just looking at you, I can see another car lost. Gosh! I hate you, I loathe you, I resent you, I just want to kill you! - What the... - What the... - What a fat bitch you are! - Of course, I'm fat. Everybody knows. But you're being absurd. It's not like your boyfriend went to my pawn shop. Even if he did, I'd curse him out for you. Hey. Where's that bitch Tuyet Anh? My street army is searching every corner and alley, but haven't found anything about her. A beautiful girl like her must be married to a Vietnamese overseas or a Westerner. Tuyet Anh will be back! I've asked my husband to spread the news to overseas Vietnamese communities around the world! Hey. Are the bananas Linh bought good? She's a sugar mommy. Of course, the bananas she selected are good! I just found out that he's seeing several women at the same time. Goddamn it, what bugs me is that the other women are older and uglier than me. Should we get revenge for you? Yes, if one member in our group is bullied, we will all get revenge for that person, right? - Right. - That's the rule of our group. How should we do it? How? Like this? No need to. That kind of man? Must be twisted like this! Stop it, bitches! I just want to warn him. It took me a lot of effort to find such a good one. Forget him. There are plenty of bananas on the shelf. I've spent lots of effort. And money. Now it's all wasted. Wasted, your money, or his banana? Both. Don't pity yourself. You know what? In just a few years, it's going to be like a grilled banana, right? Grilled bananas, anyone? Quick. What are you eating? You guys go there first, I'll go buy tickets. How many? Five for us, please. Free the students! Free the students! Why do people like fighting? They must fight over something. I think swearing is not enough for them. Hey, when we graduate, I'll tell my family to make an action movie. The Wild Horses. Each of you will play a supporting role. Students and intellectuals, let's speak up. It's my brother. Khang! Got the tickets. Free the students! Down with it! Students and intellectuals, let's speak up. Hey, guys. The cunning country girl. We've got to fight for real today. Students and intellectuals, let's speak up. What a nice day to have a good fight. As you please. They're coming. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. - Stinky face! - Stupid face! Your guts are bigger than your brain, huh? Dare to pick a fight with me? Why should I be afraid? You crazy bitch! There is no money. Hey! You! Stop! Are you hurt, dear? Untaught kids. Why did you hit her? - Mom. - Bring more money next time. Mom, forget it. Are you hurt? Who are they? Don't worry about me! How could I not worry about you? Who are they? What would you do if you knew them? Are you going to fight with them? My! My gosh. Why are you dressed like this? Fuck it, it's for the sake of the spirit. You are dressed like you're going to a sports fashion show. I'm going to curse three generations of their families. What? Dressed in sportswear? Wearing gloves. And you're just going to curse? Let's do this just like the old days. - Hey. - What? Where is Phuong? I didn't see her. What the fuck? Oh, my gosh! Is that you, Phuong? Oh, my god! What kind of outfit is this? I have to admit, Phuong is pretty good at acting like a young girl. I was afraid you guys wouldn't recognize me. Hey, where did you get this uniform from? She stole it from her daughter for sure. Hey! Crazy women! Oh, my god! I'm going to die laughing. Phuong, look at you. Just like a schoolgirl, so cute. - Your boobs look yummy, Dung. - Stop kidding! What are you touching? This. Why are they so hard? Weird. - Yes, they're hard. - Weird, my ass. Go. Let's show them who the Wild Horses are. Let's go. Hey girls, there they are! Dung, step back. Let me. I'm sick but I can still fight. You naughty girls, smoking huh? Crazy old bitches. Fight. You dare to hit my daughter! You dare? You... Security. Stop fighting. What the heck, she's on my side. Follow me! Who allowed you to punish them? You all are old enough. You have to think before you act. You have no right to beat people. If there's anything wrong you should report it to us. Who are you to give yourself that right? We just executed our group's rules for 25 years. What group? - The Wild Horses. - The Wild Horses. What are The Wild Horses? The wild horses - Hooves crushing - Hooves crushing Why are you so sad, Dung? Why are you so moody, Chau? Who loves you more than me You're looking for? Why are you always like that, Kim? Do you know I've dreamed Or The moment with you? Life is a string of worries and sorrow Love is full of dreams and destinations You're a flower in the rainy season Living in a time of storms and fire I use this love to chase away the clouds Why are you so sad, Kim? Why are you so moody, Kim? When we are in love far becomes close Why are you always like that Kim? Let's live for love Live in the dreams when we are young What if my dance moves become popular one day? Are you dreaming? You suck at dancing. It's acceptable if you can't sing well. But if you screw up the moves, people will notice. Shit, you dance like you are having seizures. But is it okay for students to perform this song? We don't need to win. We just need to show everybody the Wild Horses' style. If you don't like it, just leave. Without you, we're still doing fine. Hey, we are one group. You love her or what, My Dung? What? Since when do you like country girls, Dung? Or did you recruit her to prove that you sing better? - Stop it. - Stop it. Tuyet Anh! Wild Horses or whatever, I don't care. I'm out. What? I don't know why you hate me. But I won't let you leave our group like that, dear. Dear? Stop being so polite, you're annoying me. I... I don't understand why you hate me, Tuyet Anh. I just don't like you for no reason. Fuck off. Tuyet Anh. You are friends with Tuyet Anh? Yes, hello ma'am! You sound like you're from Thai Binh? Yes, my parents are from Thai Binh. I'm also from Thai Binh. That's why I instantly recognized your accent. Come in for a cup of tea. Have you eaten anything? Stop it. This is the first time Tuyet Anh has a friend visiting. Maybe you can stay and have dinner with us. I told you to stop it. Tuyet Anh! Why do you let your friend stand outside like this? Invite her to come in. Mommy also wants to talk to her. Who says you're my mom? You're just my dad's second wife. Please excuse me, I'm going. Hey. It's so unfair if you, dear... Don't call me dear. Don't you think it's unfair if you hate me just because your stepmom has the same accent as me? If you don't drink, you can't eat. You're not my friend. I just drank it. Are we friends now, Tuyet Anh? What I want to say is our friendship is very important. Do you know why we are important? But I don't like you and your polite way of speaking. All right. But... I still like you. Why? Because you're so pretty. The first time I saw you, I was shocked. I thought I was the prettiest girl in my old school. But all the girls in Da Lat are so pretty. Tuyet Anh. You're the prettiest. Tuyet Anh! You're the fairest of them all! I'm sorry! I know my fault is that... I'm too pretty. I will stop being pretty. Now, Phuong, you can be the prettiest. For you, for the Wild Horses, - I'll be pretty. - Yes. I'll become a Da Lat girl. I'll speak with a Da Lat accent. Now. Cheers! Cheers! - It hurts! - It will be over soon. Phuong! Help me. It hurts. It hurts. I pray to Tu Di Gong. I pray to Tu Di Gong. Your face is not inviting at all. My place is called Youth, but looking at your old face, who would want to come in? Geez! She always dreamed of becoming a superstar back then. - Like Tham Thuy Hang. - Just sit there. Someone might find an antique like you attractive. Let's go, I can't watch this anymore. We don't know how she's been. Now that we've seen her in this situation, I can't leave her like that. But seeing us, she could get even more upset. Bao Chau! Why are you kowtowing to him? Let me see it, I'll give you a discount. Hong Thu, come in. Yes, madam. Gosh, every single customer is the same, always like big boobs. I can't sleep at night if I don't drink. Hey, Bao Chau. Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about Dung. I haven't seen her for a long time. I miss her so much. Let's go see her. I'm old now, no one wants me anyway. So? I can take leave for several days. Hey. Friends are charged like customers, okay? Madam! What? Can I? Borrowing money again? No way. Please, madam. Gosh. I haven't got my tontine share, I don't have any money. Madam! We have enough girls here. Go to other places for a job. I want to have this lady for a few days. If it's not enough, here. It's enough. I'm going, madam. Take care. Things are strange nowadays, girls pay for girls. Anyway, as long as you have the money you can do anything you want. Dung! I didn't think I'd be able to see you again. Life is full of miracles, so we can see each other again. Bao Chau. I remember your family ran a film studio. In the entire Da Lat, only the Wild Horses had a video diary. I think I still have that film roll. It's been a long time, I'm not sure if it's still in good shape. Those were the best days of my life. My Dung. There will be a Prince Charming coming for you. You will have a happy family. With lots of children and grandchildren. You have a beautiful voice, but you won't become a singer, because you don't like to act cute. That's what Bao Chau does. You just want to sing when you're having fun with friends. And? You will forever be the leader of the Wild Horses, to take care of every member until your last breath. When you watch this again you're surely going to admire your ability to predict your future. Right? Next, Lan Chi! My turn! Hey. Everyone says I'm fat, but I think I'm gracefully fat. As for me, I'll become the owner of a bank. I'm pretty sure about that. So if anyone in the group needs money, I'll give her an interest-free loan. Quickly, the film is expensive. Lan Chi. You'll have a kid as charming as you, as pretty as Tuyet Anh, as strong as Dung, as rich as Bao Chau, but don't pick up the swearing habit of Thuy Linh. Remember... - to study well like Hieu Phuong. - ...to study well like Hieu Phuong. You walk slowly and speak even slower. It's my first time in front of the camera, so I'm nervous. Shit, I forgot what I wanted to say. Quick. I remember. Thuy Linh! You're going to travel around the world, and have your own dictionary, collecting the best cursing words on Earth. You bitch. Oh, Tuyet Anh. Tuyet Anh was so beautiful back then. Hey. She was almost as pretty as me. Me? I would say... A single moment of glory is better than a hundred years of banality! - Wow! - Wow! That's it. Hieu Phuong, you're not the only one who is good at literature. Hieu Phuong, you're the best when it comes to words, say something nice. Don't be shy. Say it. Me? I think the Wild Horses, will all be successful and I'm not sure if I want to be a screenwriter or a painter. All of you surely will be richer than me. But rest assured, I will draw or write a book about the Wild Horses. About the girls who have the most lovely youth on Earth. Now looking back, our thoughts back then were so childish and naive. I think if Tuyet Anh is still alive, she will definitely come to see me. However... I'm afraid I won't be here to see her. I, Bao Chau. I will never forget the Wild Horses. Even when I'm married to a rich man or I become a superstar, I will always remember you guys. And when you guys need help, find me and I will always be there for all of you. Yes! Oh, right. - I will save the best seats... - I will save the best seats for the Wild Horses. In the special screenings of my film premieres. Stop it! Hey, country girl! You drink like that in the countryside? What do you want? I don't get why they recruited a stupid country girl like you. Look at yourself? Hanging out with punks. You look just like a junkie. Don't expect My Dung and her gang to be around you forever. Those petty bitches, they will soon kick you out. Don't mess with me. Watch out. Stop clinging onto My Dung all the time. You're acting like a servant. LET'S MEET AFTER SCHOOL! Hey, country girl! I heard you used to be friends with My Dung. But My Dung stopped hanging out with you because you use drugs. So it's not my fault. It's yours. Apologize to me. You didn't tell me to go alone. Apologize, my ass. Take off her pants. Let go of me. - I'll give you a taste of humiliation. - Let go of me! Don't take off my clothes. Take them off. - Quickly. - Let go! - Let go of me. - Take them off. Stubborn, huh? You think you're better than us? Hey, let go of my friend. What are you going to do to me? What did you just say? Tuyet Anh, please spare me. Tuyet Anh. Tuyet Anh. Don't kill her. Tuyet Anh. If I were you, I'd never show up at school again. What would you like? One coffee, black and strong. Just a moment, please. Shoulders to shoulders Life is so peaceful Looking for each other's lips With broken hearts Hand in hand, I wish to be Imprisoned in someone's heart Salty tangled hair, traces of sad love Looking at you at this very moment I want to say I love you Here's your coffee. Thank you. What can I help you with? May I ask? Are you Dong Ho? You know me? A childhood friend sent you this. NOSTALGIA CAFÉ Hey, I'm telling you guys. I'm sure Tuyet Anh will be the Beauty Queen this time. - Gosh, that's enough. - Looks good enough. Let's go. Okay, you can start counting now, let's start. Coffee. Hey, Tuyet Anh. Yes? I just had a walk around. No one in this school can steal the beauty queen title from you. Why do you keep babbling like a teenage boy? Well... Just saying. Hey, Hieu Phuong, come over here. Quick, let's practice. Quick. Let's start. Five, six, seven, eight. What's wrong? I'm hungry. Let's go find something to eat. You. MISS CAMLY You got to drink with me. Where are you going? Want to drink with me? Hey, country girl. What are you eating? Can I have some? - Kieu Chinh. - See me eating like a country girl? Are you crazy? Am I crazy? Am I crazy? Kieu Chinh, are you on drugs again? Let's go. Why does everybody despise me as if I'm a stray dog? Why? You can't bully my friends. And you can't tear down my picture. What's so special about you? You think you're pretty? Tuyet Anh! How is Tuyet Anh? She wanted to kill herself. She's all right! She's all right! We're expelled. Are we not going to see each other again? No? It can't be the end of the Wild Horses. People! We are betrayed! President Thieu has abandoned us. The commanders are on planes and flying away, leaving our soldiers on battlefields. We must save ourselves and our families. Don't believe in their calls and tricks. They are all lies. Is it really the end? What's going to happen with the Wild Horses? Whatever happens, we will see each other again. With Tuyet Anh, of course. We will dance and sing the song of our group. Got it? Got it? We will see each other again. If your lives are hard and you avoid us, we will come to help you. We can't say who's going to leave first. But until that day... No. Even longer than that, the Wild Horses, our group, the Wild Horses will never separate! Never! Do you agree? Agree? Agree? Hieu Phuong. Thuy Linh. Lan Chi. Bao Chau. Do you agree? - Agree! - Agree! My! Dad! I can just go home by myself as always. You don't need to come here. And with Phuong My! Well, if you don't like it... Of course, I like it! Thanks to Ms. My Dung, Mom's friend. Mom has a very cool group of friends. How is your friend now? Our family should go visit her. Hello, this is Phuong. Hey, girls! Now we're only missing Tuyet Anh, the last of the Wild Horses. This motherfucker, Tuyet Anh! She thinks she's beautiful, so she always distances herself from her friends. I wonder what her face looks like now? Maybe she's afraid of her scarred face, that's why she doesn't dare to come and see us? Linh might be right. But I believe Tuyet Anh is not as bad as you think. If she hears of My Dung's passing, I'm sure she will come. Hey. There is a visitor. Well... Are you ladies the members of the Wild Horses? Let me introduce myself, I am Ms. My Dung's lawyer. I am here to execute the will of Hoang My Dung. Ms. My Dung specifically asked me to read exactly what's written here. No adjustment. "Hey, you bitches!" Hey! Don't think you're her lawyer so you can say whatever you want. No, it's written here. I told you guys I'm reading exactly what she wrote. Sorry. Please let me read it again. "Hey, you mother..." Okay, let's skip this part. Okay, I'll continue. Is anyone here? If you guys can't come, I understand. Sorry for not keeping the promise. The promise we made in front of Tuyet Anh's house in Da Lat, more than 20 years ago. I know I'm not a good leader for I have left you guys too soon. Hieu Phuong! Thank you for finding our friends. My life is short but as you said, I was the hero in it. "Thank you for that. Guys, live happily, be together for me. All of you, live to the fullest!" Ms. My Dung has gifts for all of you. Ms. Hieu Phuong. "Hieu Phuong will be the new leader of the Wild Horses." All right. I agree. Keep it like that. "Hey, Hieu Phuong. You could still go on fighting with us. You are still very young, you can't live without dreams. Finish your dream of writing a book about the girls who have the most lovely youth on earth. Can you promise me?" Ms. Lan Chi. It's me. I'm Lan Chi. "Ms. Lan Chi will receive 300 million VND for her daughter's heart surgery." Dung. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Dung. You are the second mother of my child. "You're good at finding people. Find Thuy Linh a good man who has a good banana!" What the fuck? Just grilled banana now. Ms. Thuy Linh. What? What do I get? This house is so big. How can I live here by myself? "The Swearing Queen. I know you've been wanting to be the group's leader. But I think you should be the deputy leader. Because you can't fight like me. And you can't curse like Hieu Phuong. And you're already rich, you bitch. That's why I didn't leave anything for you. I just hope you can find a guy who can tolerate your swearing habit." And Ms. Bao Chau. "You can stay at my house. My savings will be managed by Hieu Phuong and she will help you pay off your debts. The rest of the money will be used to open a beauty salon for you to manage. Remember to give discounts to all members of the Wild Horses." Dung. Thank you! Oh, Ms. Dung also asked all of you to do one thing. Sure. - What is it? - We'll do anything. "Perform the song of the Wild Horses." What the heck? Goddamn it. How can I remember the dance steps after so long? And also how can we dance in this situation? But this is My Dung's last wish. Are we allowed to dance at funerals? My Dung wants it that way. If anyone complains, I'll take responsibility. Why are you so sad, Kim? Why are you so moody, Kim? No one loves you more than I do Why are you always like that? Do you know that my heart has been Dreaming of being with you? Life is a series of days full of worries Love is dreamy destinations You are like a blooming flower In the rainy season Living in the middle of the storm I'm bringing my love to clear the clouds Why are you so sad, Kim? Why are you so blue, Kim? When we are in love far becomes close Why are you always like that Kim? Let's live for love Live in the dreams when we are young
