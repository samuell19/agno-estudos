(upbeat music) - Hi. Come on, get in. (upbeat music) (somber beat music) (wind howling) (pleasant music) - Goodbye, son. Look, Pat, won't you change your mind, even if it's for the boy's sake? (pleasant music) (airplane whooshing) (pleasant instrumental music) (wind howling) What's the trouble? - I don't know. It won't go. - You'd better get in and push the starter when I tell you. - Okay. - All right. Try to start it now. (engine puttering) - Would you be awfully kind and give me a ride? - Of course. (engine rumbling) Where abouts in Palm Springs do you live? - Just up the canyon road, I'll show you. It was lucky for me that you came along. - I was just coming back from the airport. I've just seen my wife and step-son off. - They going on vacation? - Yes, that's right. They've gone back east to her father's place. (wind howling) You have a beautiful house. - Do you like it? - It's unique. - Thank you. What would you like to drink? - Anything. Anything, thank you. - How about scotch? - Fine. Fine, thank you. - I've better call a service station. - Yes, I think you'd better. (phone dial cranking) - Hello, Mr. Walters. This is Caroline Norman. My car is broken down and I had to leave it on the airport road. Would you mind collecting it for me, please? Thank you. Bye, bye. What's your name? - Randolph. Greg Randolph. - You know mine. - Yes. I heard you say. - Come on, finish that one up. - [Greg] No, no. - [Caroline] No? - That's fine. Just fine. - What do you do? For a living, I mean. - I write. - Really? What sort of things do you write? - Mostly for television. - Oh. Are you good? - I think so. (giggling) But then, I'm probably a majority of one. - That doesn't mean that you don't have any talent. My husband's in the entertainment business. He's with New Century Pictures. He's executive producer. - He's quite and important man, then. - Oh, he certainly is. He's an armchair expert. If you ever needed brain surgery, they'd take his hemorrhoids out. - That doesn't sound very complimentary. - Wasn't intended to be. However, I do think you should meet him. Maybe he needs an up-and-coming young writer. I'll talk to him for you. - You're very nice. But then, you might think that I'm using you. - Nonsense. They always need good material. They've made so many flops that they have to come up with new ideas. I heard Lenny say so about a month ago. - I'd like that very much. If you think it would do any good. - You might be good. So you must come by for dinner tonight. Lenny will be home from New York. - Are you sure he won't mind? - Hell no. I can have anyone I want here. Doesn't matter to Lenny. He couldn't care less. - He might think I'm intruding. After all, he has been away. - I won't take no for an answer, Greg. Now you'll be by at seven, won't you. - Thanks, I'd like to. Now I must be going. - You won't stay for another drink? - I really do have to go. - Okay. - Thanks. - Greg, I'll expect you at seven then. - Yes. I'll be here. (somber music) (snapping) (pleasant music) (phone ringing) Hello? Yes. Who is it? - [Man] Mr. Randolph, this is the bank. Mr. Johnson, here. We have a check in today on your account which is overdrawn, sir. Can you come in to see to it? - Look, Mr. Johnson, it's okay now. I've just got a contract for five thousand dollars. - [Johnson] I suppose that will be all right if you can bring the contract in for me to see. - I can bring it in today. - [Johnson] That's all right. Tomorrow will do. - Thank you very much. Bye. (doorbell ringing) Mrs. Norman is expecting me. - Please come in, sir. - Greg, I'm so glad you came early. Lenny hasn't arrived yet. Come and have a drink. - Thank you. - Would you like scotch? That's what I'm having. - Surely. - Here's to your next script, Greg. - I'll drink to that. I just received a notice this morning. I've got a contract for my last script. - Oh, I wish you so much success. (phone ringing) Yes, hello? Oh, Lenny, it's you. Where are you? (muffled phone conversation) Yeah, I bet you have. What's the matter? Does that bunch of queers got you locked in a bedroom? (muffled phone conversation) Well you coulda called me earlier than this. (muffled phone conversation) All right, Lenny. If I have to see you in a week or so, have fun! - I take it your husband won't be back tonight. - No, he's got some big thing going on in New York. Company business or some other business, I don't know. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. - Millie? Mr. Norman won't be home tonight. We'll have dinner whenever you wish. - [Millie] Yes, Mrs. Norman, will 20 minutes be okay? - That'll do. Come on, Greg, let's go out on the patio and get some air before we eat. - Okay. - Have you ever cheated on your wife, Greg? - I haven't up till now. - What would you think if I told you I was married to a homosexual? - Is that why you drink, Caroline? - Yes. He probably didn't come home tonight because he and his playmates were having fun and games. - Perhaps you're imagining things. - I don't think so, Greg. All I want is someone to give me a little affection. - And you think I might be that person? - Could be. Kiss me. (somber music) - Has he always been like that? - He changed after we were married. Sex with me wasn't enough. He had to find new kicks. - He must be out of his mind to neglect someone as beautiful as you, Caroline. - What about you, Greg? Are you in love with your wife? - I don't know. But I may as well tell you, she hasn't gone on any vacation. She's left me and went back to live with her father. - Well if she didn't have any faith in you then she didn't deserve you. I'm glad she's gone back. - [Millie] I can serve now, Mrs. Norman. - Thank you, Millie. So you're a bachelor living on your own? - Yes. It rather looks that way. - Thank you, Millie. - Thanks. (upbeat music) - You can go home now, Millie. I can manage everything else. - [Millie] Thank you, Mrs. Norman. (upbeat music) - Would you like some coffee or dessert or anything else? - Thanks, no. (upbeat music) (pleasant beat music) - A little drink, perhaps? - If you wish. - I do wish. What would you like? - Let's stick to scotch. - Okay. (sighing) (pleasant beat music) Did you like that? - What do you think? Isn't this a little dangerous? I mean, both of us here alone. Your husband might not like this. - Are you kidding? Lenny? He wouldn't give a damn. - I don't wanna do anything to you that could be embarrassing for you. - Don't give it another thought. Come on. (pleasant beat music) - Come on. Let's go and have a drink. - Greg, don't you wanna make love to me? - Caroline, let's have another drink. Of course I want to make love to you. But when you know what you are doing, really. - What makes you think I don't know what I'm doing now? - When you haven't been drinking. - I know what I'm doing. - Perhaps you do. But try to be a little rational. - Greg, what's wrong with you? You make me feel inferior. - Oh no. Come on. Let's have another drink. Take it easy. Come here. (pleasant beat music) - Come on, Greg. Come to bed with me. If you don't, I'll drink and drink and drink. - That sounds like a lot of drinks. - Yep. And I'll be very, very drunk. - Can you walk to bed? - Then you do wanna go to bed with me. It's over there. (shushing) (giggling) (pleasant beat music) Undress me, Greg. - Now go to sleep. - Oh, Greg. Don't go. Please, don't go. - Good night, Caroline. (typewriter clicking) (phone ringing) Hello? Caroline. - Greg, darling. Why did you leave me last night? - [Greg] Because you had too much to drink. - Why don't you come over and have breakfast with me? - Breakfast? Don't you realize that it's almost noon? - What difference does it make? I only just woke up. Come on, hurry over. Then we can go out somewhere together. - Okay, Caroline. I'll be right over. I just have to make a stop at the bank. - Hurry, darling, won't you? (doorbell ringing) Greg, is that you? I'm in the bath. - Yes, Caroline. - Come on in, there's no one else here. (water sloshing) Don't just stand there, come on in. Why did you leave me last night? - You were almost stoned. (chuckling) - I wanted you to stay, Greg. - Where's your maid? - I sent her out. What took you so long to get here? - I told you, I had to go to the bank. - I thought you were never coming. - When is your husband coming back? - What difference does that make? (door closing) Millie, is that you? - Yes, Mrs. Norman. - [Caroline] Would you hand me a towel, Greg? (water sloshing) - You didn't answer my question. - Oh, you mean about Lenny? - Mhmm. - Don't worry about him. I promise you, he won't interfere with anything that we do. - I hope you're telling me the truth. - Why? Are you afraid that he might come in now? Or maybe come in later when we're making love? - It might be embarrassing. - Not for me, it wouldn't. I assure you, he wouldn't care. - How did you ever come to marry a man like this? - Oh, you know. Small part starlet finds big future in marrying a producer. I never did work in another film after that, though. But I was a useful showpiece for him. - Where shall we go? (pleasant classical music) - Do you think you'll go back to your wife, Greg? - I don't know. - Do you want to? - It wouldn't be very complimentary to you if I said yes. I wasn't even thinking of her. (pleasant classical music) - [Announcer] At the present time, we are operating on a 30 minute schedule. The car leaves the station every 30 minutes. (pleasant classical music) - [Greg] Why did you bring me up here? - I thought it would be a change from staying in the house. You don't want me drinking, do you? - In moderation, maybe. But I think I understand why you do it, Caroline. After all, you have more than good reason. - I just wanna be with you, Greg. I hated myself last night. It was too easy for you, wasn't it? - Yes. Perhaps. - That was yesterday. It isn't like that today, is it? - You still want to be loved? - Of course I do. Our beautiful love with all the preliminaries. And I don't want to be half-drunk when it happens to me either. - And what happens afterward if I'm not around? - I honestly don't know, Greg. Perhaps it depends on you. Tomorrow you might wanna forget me. - Maybe it's too soon for either of us to know, Caroline. - Then let's find out. (pleasant guitar music) (upbeat music) (pleasant guitar music) (upbeat music) (pleasant guitar music) (upbeat music) (moaning) (pleasant guitar music) (upbeat music) (moaning) (upbeat music) (moaning) - My lord, what happened here last night? (knocking) Oh I'm sorry, Mrs. Norman, I woke you. I just want to put these things away. - That's all right, Millie. Why don't you take the day off? I have to go out for the day. - Shall I fix you a breakfast or run you bath water before I leave? - No, that's all right. You just go on home and have a good rest. - Thank you, Miss Norman. (door closing) - It's all right. You can come up now. (giggling) You know, you really shouldn't be so embarrassed. It doesn't matter if she knows you're here. - Do you want everyone in Palm Springs to know? - Doesn't make any difference. It's none of their business. And a lot of these respectable types are sleeping with somebody else's husband or wife anyway. - I'm thinking only of you. - I don't care, Greg, really I don't. Don't you worry about a thing. What can we do today? Let's just go somewhere and have fun. - I should go home and do some work, you know. - Not today, Greg. - Why not? - Because I have other ideas. - Don't you think you're risking a divorce if Lenny finds out about us? - Not a chance, darling. What I do doesn't alter what he wants to do one little bit. It's a perfect arrangement. - [Greg] I hope you're right. - [Caroline] We can go away for weekends, holidays, anything at all. - [Greg] What if you get pregnant? What then? (Caroline giggling) - [Caroline] Oh, that'd be wonderful. I'd love to see his face if that happens. - [Greg] How can you laugh at a thing like that? - [Caroline] I'm serious, Greg, really I am. There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about. - [Greg] Only one thing, Caroline. I don't have the money to do all these things. - [Caroline] Look, if Lenny won't give me the affection I need, than he can pay for somebody else to. (pleasant music) (waves sloshing) (waves rumbling) (pleasant music) (waves sloshing) (pleasant music) (splashing) (waves rumbling) (typewriter clicking) - Hi, Greg. - [Greg] Hello. - You couldn't hear me so I let myself in. - I was just doing some work on a new script. - Don't let me stop you. I'm going in the pool. Do you mind? - No. (pleasant beat music) (splashing) (pleasant beat music) - How would you explain things if your wife were to come right now? - I'd tell her I was waiting for a street car and I'd never seen you before in my life. - Coward. - Anyway, what made you decide to come over here? - Well, I hadn't seen your house before and I thought we might make love. (pleasant beat music) - I can manage, darling. (pleasant beat music) (doorbell ringing) (giggling) - Your wife. - Uh-uh. She won't get back as quickly as that. - Would you sign, please? - [Greg] Thank you. - You're welcome. - [Caroline] What is it, Greg? - She didn't waste any time. It's my wife. She wants a divorce. - Does it matter? - Not really, I suppose. - Then forget that old letter. Do you love me, Greg? - Sure I do. - My wife tells me you're a writer. We're always interested in good ideas at New Century. Do you have something we can read? - Well, my stuff has been for television. I've never written for the theatrical market. My agent tells me that writing on spec is foolish. - That's true, for the most part. But we could always go along on a step-by-step basis, if you come up with a good idea. Anyhow, we can always talk about it. - Thanks. I'd like to. - Greg was here the other night when you missed your plane. He was on his way back from the airport when my car broke down and he gave me a ride home. - That was very fortunate for you, Caroline. - Yes, it was. Did you have fun on your trip, Lenny? I trust that all your little friends are still hopping around. - And what is that supposed to mean? - Nothing, darling. I just thought you might have time to look in on them. Incidentally, I was telling Greg that you wouldn't mind if you came in and saw us both in bed together. - No, of course I wouldn't. As they say in Paris, "My bed is your bed." It happens all the time in this day in age. - Do you mean to say that you don't mind your wife going to bed with other men? - No, Greg, he doesn't. - It happens all the time in my business. It's always more acceptable when it's out in the open and then there are no unpleasant consequences. - There, you see, Greg? Now you don't have to feel guilty about it. Come on, have another drink. - You'd better make it a double. - So, you two have been having fun and games while I was away. - [Caroline] That's right. Haven't you? - [Lenny] Nothing different. - I suggested to Greg that we let you arrive home and find us both naked and making love on the bed. I would like to have seen your face. What would you do, Lenny? - I'd go over to the bar, pour myself a drink and then I'd watch his technique. - If you had walked in while I was going that, I wouldn't have any technique. (Caroline chuckling) - You don't have to worry, my friend. If you and Caroline wanna have fun and games, it's all right by me. But don't you have a wife or someone who might not be so benevolent if she found out? - Greg's wife isn't here. She left him. - Go on. This conversation intrigues me. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Caroline] Hello, darling. Lenny has some of his playmates coming down for the weekend. Why don't we go down to Las Vegas? How about it? - It's a great idea. On one condition. We don't go gambling. - I wasn't planning on going there to gamble, Greg. We can leave tomorrow after lunch if it's okay with you. Don't you? (jazzy upbeat music) Is there room for me in there? - Be my guest. (upbeat music) - Yeah? - [Caroline] Hi, Millie, this is Mrs. Norman. Let me talk to my husband please. - Just a moment please. Mr. Norman, your wife's on the phone. - Hello Caroline, where are you? - [Caroline] In Las Vegas. I was wondering if your playmates were still there. If they are, we can stay over another day or so. - My friends left this morning. You may as well come back. - [Caroline] Okay, Lenny, we'll see you tomorrow. Bye. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (upbeat instrumental radio music) - Isn't that sweet? (menacing music) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (screaming) (crying) (screaming) (menacing music) - Come on, Marco, take her. - No! (Caroline crying) (ominous music) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (foreboding music) (groaning) (ominous music) (crickets chirping) - Now what? - What do you mean, now what? We're gonna keep the broad here, that's now what! - You can't just keep me here. Do you realize what will happen to you? Kidnapping and murder? - And what is supposed to happen to us? - You'll get the gas chamber, that's what. - You're the only one who can I identify us, which doesn't make you a good insurance risk. Just be a good girl and take it nice and cool. Your chances are a lot better. - But you just can't keep me here indefinitely. - Why can't we? You're gonna stay here until we see it otherwise. - That's right. This way we can all stay in practice. After all, you're not a bad screw. - What do you think I am, an animal? - You've been screwed before. What're you squawking about? Haven't you? Well, haven't you? - If you mean, have I been made love to before, yes. But never like that. - What difference does it make? All you gotta do is keep feeding my friends and get them hungry. Billy, there, is a real mean bastard when he don't get his pussy. Now you're gonna treat us real good, aint you baby? - Why don't you just kill me? It would be kinder. I'd rather have that than have you rape me again. - We have to! You're a good-looking broad. Our little screwing aint gonna do you harm. Now just play it nice and cool. Real cool. - How're you gonna make sure she doesn't try to take off while we're asleep? - [Marco] Because we're gonna tie her to the bed. Get some rope, Bobo. - The hell with it. I'll get some sleep. - [Marco] Get some rope! - Yeah, yeah. - If you let me go, my husband will pay you. - Who the hell did we croak? - He was a friend. - A friend, huh? Well you two were making nice and cozy in the car. I'd say he was a very good friend. - He was a friend. Is there anything wrong with that? - This might shed a new light on things. We can give you a suggestion to spare the bullet. The car like you drive, I bet your old man is worth a few bucks. Maybe we can work something out. - I guess the cops have found it by now. Maybe we oughta listen to the radio. - They won't find it until tomorrow. We left it in the middle of nowhere, remember? - [Caroline] Look, my husband will pay you. - There's just one little problem here, misses... What's your name? - Caroline. Caroline Norman. - All right, Mrs. Norman. I think I mentioned it before. You're the only one who can identify us, which isn't so good. However, I think we can work something out. - It's simple. Let's just collect the bread and then knock her off. - Oh god. - Here, Billy, fix her up nice and comfortable. - Maybe I oughta sleep with her. That'll solve a lot of problems. - [Marco] The way you sleep, she could be in China and you wouldn't know it. We'll keep her in good condition until we find out how much her old man thinks she's worth. - No! - Maybe I oughta knock her up. That way we can get two for the price of one. - You pig! (whimpering) (police siren alarming) (siren alarming) (crickets chirping) - I've located the victim of the shooting. The man is unconscious and suffering from several gunshot wounds. He's about 32 years of age, black hair and approximately 140 pounds and five, nine. There is no identification. We'll stand by until the ambulance arrives. Over. (crickets chirping) - How much are you gonna ask for? - He might be good for about a hundred grand. Let's ask the dame (Caroline whimpering) Now look, baby. If you don't cooperate, we're gonna dig a hole out there for you. Do you understand? - Yes. - What does your old man do? - He's a producer. The New Century Studios. - Does he have that kind of money? - No. I don't think so. - I better ask him then, hadn't I? Producer, huh? I'll call him. What's his number, Mrs. Norman? - It's 273-0778 in Palm Springs. - What time was he expecting you home? - This morning. - What about your boyfriend? Does he know about him? Perhaps we did your old man a good term, knocking him off. - I don't think that's any of your business. - Oh, that's right. It isn't, is it? (crying) I'll be away for a few hours, boys. You get hungry Bobo, you can have another slice off the cake. - I'll keep it in mind. - Bring some more booze back, will you Marco? And don't make it long. - Just take it easy. And don't take any chances with this broad. See ya. I want to speak with Mr. Norman. Mr. Leonard Norman. Nevermind who this is. Just get him on the phone. - Mr. Norman, you're wanted on telephone. - Who is it? - I don't know, they wouldn't say. - Who is it? - Are you Norman? - Yes, I am. - We have your wife, Mr. Norman. Now if you want her back alive it's gonna cost you money. A hundred grand. You will. We picked her up with a boyfriend. He thought we were kidding so we put a half a dozen slugs in him. If you still don't believe me, I'll tell you where you can find the body. - I don't know whether you have my wife or not, but I'm not going to pay you a nickel. Yes, inspector. The man told me that they have my wife. He also told me that they killed a friend of ours who was with her. A Mr. Greg Randolph. - [Inspector] Yes, just a minute. Randolph's in the hospital. He's been critically wounded and a signal just came in a few minutes ago. Your wife's car has been found abandoned. We'll be right over, Mr. Norman. - Thank you, inspector. (Caroline whimpering) - Didn't you bring any beer? - No I didn't. We've got something else to worry about. - What's the problem? - It's her old man, he won't play. Says he won't pay up a nickel. - Why not try him again tomorrow? - Give her a Yul Brynner, send her hair back to him. - Just so he won't think we're kidding. But then what? - Send him a couple of fingers. That should give him something to think about. - Christ, yes. That should shape him. - You say your wife told you she was traveling back from Las Vegas and bringing Mr. Randolph with her. - Yes. She telephoned me. Said she ran into Greg there and that they would be coming back together. How is he? - Pretty bad, I'm afraid. But he was able to tell us that three men stopped them on the highway when they stopped to rest. They robbed them, kidnapped your wife and shot him. - What do you propose to do, inspector? - I'll station a man here, just in case they call back. Due to the fact that you have refused to cooperate with him, I want you to stay with that same line of talk but leave the door open for negotiation. We'll take it from there. Millie, is there anything that you could possibly add to what you've already told us? - No, sir. Is there anything else, sir? - No, but if they contact you, please let us know. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. I can send over another man. If anything transpires, I'll get in touch with you immediately. - All right, inspector. - Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Norman. - Good day, gentlemen. - Billy, you're a pretty smart boy with explosives, aren't you? - Well I should be, shouldn't I? After all, the government paid for my training. What's on your mind? - I been thinking. Even if we convince her old man to pay up, we then gotta get off the scene. I mean the cops, the FBI, everybody's gonna be on our trail. Can you rig the old car out there so we can blow it up without wires? Like a remote control? - Sure I can, if you can get me the gear. What's the plan? - Just this. If we make a pickup, they're going to be ready to jump on us immediately when we get the dough. So we stick the broad in the trunk of the car and wire it. If anybody tries to stop us from getting away, we'll blow the thing to bits. How does that sound? - Logical. - Make a list of the things you need. We'll go into town. (wind howling) - Get some pictures of this whole area, here, before we lose all the tracks. (wind howling) Take these into the lab. (phone ringing) - Take it over there, please. (phone ringing) - Yes? Oh, it's you. - I'm going to give you another chance, Mr. Norman, otherwise your wife's going to get it. I assure you, we're not kidding. - Look, I told you guys before, I'm not gonna pay you a nickel. Because if you intend to kill my wife, you'll do it anyway. You three punks are signing your own death warrants. - How do you know there were three of us? - [Lenny] Because the man you shot has been able to give a description of you and the police know who you are. - That doesn't matter, mister. We have your wife. And if you think you're gonna get off the hook, think again, because tomorrow we're gonna send you her hair. All of it. And the following day, a couple of fingers. You wanna try our bluff? - If I pay you any money, I'll never see my wife alive again. - Look, Mr. Norman, we don't have to kill your wife. The cops know through the other guy who we are. We'll let her go if you pay up. That's on the level. - I can't pay up. I don't have that kind of money. We've all been hit by the stock exchange. - What kind of money do you have, Norman? - [Lenny] I suppose about 20 thousand. - That's not enough. 40 thousand and that's it. - I don't know. You'll have to call me back tonight. I have to see if I can raise that much money. - All right. 10 o'clock tonight. I'll call you back. But don't have the cops on us or else it's curtains for Caroline. - Leave the line clear for five minutes. Then I'll call the office. - Looks like you're gonna be all right, baby. Your old man's gonna come up with 40 grand. - You don't know my husband. - We'll see. - You got the good old goodies there, Billy? - That's right. A little present for Mrs. Norman. If your old man tries anything funny, you've had it. - I hope that won't be necessary. - All right, they've called back and Norman's made arrangements to pay the ransom money. Right, stay with him. Continue recording all incoming and outgoing telephone calls. That's right. Give Norman his instructions in case they call again. If it's necessary to contact me, use the radio. Good. Pretty funny business with this Norman couple. Wife is obviously having an affair and husband knows all about it. - From my discussions with the maid, it seems as if Randolph has slept at the house with Mrs. Norman. She also described some pretty weird things that went on at that house over the weekend with some friends of his that were down from New York. - Well, there's plenty of nuts around, that's for sure. Have you got anything on the kidnappers? - Yes, sir. Randolph identified these mugshots. - Marco. Johnny Marco. He's a longtime loser, this one. Escaped prison last March 17th. Bobo Jackson. This is a nice pair. Billy Driscoll in here too. Better be careful with him. He's an explosive expert. He's pulled some pretty nasty jobs. Been out about 18 months. We're gonna have to be careful with them. Real careful or Mrs. Norman's gonna be in her grave. (ominous music) - All set? - Yeah, just about. Tell Marco to bring the dame out. We're almost ready. (ominous music) - Come on, baby. It's your day. Taking you back to your old man. (ominous music) - Frank, keep out of sight until we pick up Mrs. Norman. Her husband should be making the payoff in about 15 minutes. Now don't go near the car until I give you the signal. - Right, sir. - We'll pick up these guys, then we'll get Mrs. Norman out. (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Hold it! You and your wife are dead if anything moves around here. Give me the case. How much is there inside? - 40 thousand. - There better be. - Where's my wife? - About a half mile down the road locked in the trunk of a car. The cops or anybody comes, we'll blow it to bits.
