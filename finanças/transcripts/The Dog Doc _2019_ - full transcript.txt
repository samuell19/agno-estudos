- I - was invited to lecture in 1986 And I did it on cancer. And I showed the cases, showed the records. One of my best friends left the room and stood outside the door of the lecture room and said, don't go in there. This guy is crazy. At that time, the wall againstalternatives was so great, I never had a chance. But I kept on making patients better. Every major chronic disease is on the rise. I'll see you later. And now, I'm not satisfied in being ableto take what I've learned and what I've applied and keep it confined. Yes, I've been criticized. But after 45 years, I'm very proud knowing that what we are doing works. Hey, how's it going? Good morning. Tilly's here for Dr. Goldstein. Hey. Hello. Let's go. Hi, how are you? Good morning. Yeah, Beautiful question. You ready? Ooh! Yeah! Dr. Goldstein saidthat he did a brief ultrasound and found masses throughout her spleen. They've already tried 20 different drugs. None of it's worked. So let's start using IV vitamin C therapy. With the cryosurgery,we actually freeze the tumor. It buys us time to work on the immune system. So we have a Magna Wave here. Dr. Jenna is gonna giveher a Magna Wave treatment. Her other vet was about to put her down today. We can help. And we're going to keep moving forward. You're going home. We're going to concentrate on keeping him as healthyand happy as we possibly can. That's the whole mentalitydifference about how we look at things differently. We've gone so far outof the box other veterinarians call us crazy. We don't want to remove his leg if it's something that we can save. OK, are yougonna come down for the consult or do you want to do phone consult? Coming in to seeJenna tomorrow at 12:00 noon. We've got oneappointment available for Dr. Shane for today. Dr. Goldstein is probablygoing to be in surgery. We requested a copy of aCT scan for a mutual client a couple of times. And they're here for theirappointment right now. And we still don't have the surgery-- Katie is ready to go back. The other doctors gavethe dog five months to live. That was four and a half years ago. I'll just wait till she's awake. This really looks great. Cathy, can you give me an 18-gauge needle? Come onsies. Hi. You're a neat guy with a big head. The other vet scared me because he was like, well, it could be cancer. I might need to amputate the toe. Do you think that we need to do that on his-- No. My god, that's why I started getting really nervous that they-- I've set my life up notonly to be a veterinarian, but a veterinarian that dealswith hopeless, terminal cases from all over the world. Most of the animals that we see already had second, third,fourth, and fifth opinions before they came here. And now we are the very last hope. Each one of these spotsis a lung tumor, must be 100. I teach my doctors that you want to get to apoint where you're trying to support that patient's immunesystem so it could heal itself. This is going very well. Very well. And what I'velearned over the last 45 years is that we have to treat a disease by using conventional andalternative medicines together. Wafflesis here for Dr. Ruskin. Let's see, so itlooks to me like you adopted. And at that point we were 100% healthy, you didn't notice anything? He was fine at that point. Well, we would play outside. He jumped up like a little-- Yeah, a little jumpy bean. --jumping bean. OK. And as time progressed, he started not playing. I tried different toys. He wasn't interested, didn't chew on sticks. So it was like one thing dropping off. You just keptseeing quality of life go down, down, down. Go down and down and down. I had been going to another doctor to get him in for his updated shots. And she said he has a fever. So she put him on Metronidazole. And then I took him to my vet. He had them run bloodwork and some more X-rays and said this really is out of my league. I think you should go seean internist at an emergency hospital whereupon she put himon Doxycycline for two weeks. And they said you should seehim pick up after five days. Well, it's 14. And this is-- This is still it. --still where we are. And I've been loading this dog up with food. I don't know where it's going. OK. You must be just overwhelmed. - I am. - I can't imagine. I am. Because I look at this, I mean, we see the worst of the worst here. We get files this thick here. And even I'm overwhelmed by all the twisting and turning of this case. There seems to be things going on everywhere. You know, there's possiblejoint inflammation. There's possible liver inflammation. He was described ashaving a hunched position. Like, was he walking kind of with his back arched? He had a hunched-- back arched. OK. Can we put him on the floorso I can see how he walks? Come on. Come on. Yeah, so he is kind of doing that arched walk still with his back. Hi, sweetie. Hi. See this, how he, when I back him up, see what's happening with his right hind leg? Yeah, he's notreally doing anything. The rabies vaccineis given in the right hind leg. So the patients that I've seen that have a rabies vaccine reaction, theright hind leg declines first. Right. And then it gets, you know,worse-- then it progresses up, you know, from there. OK. So the vaccines,I believe they have a place as far as preventing disease. But they shouldn't be given toa patient who is not healthy, otherwise they have more thanthe immune system can handle. And it just makes everything snowball. And vaccine reactions do get worse with time. And, you know, unfortunatelyconventional medicine doesn't really have, youknow, a treatment for this. But we do. You do? We do, yeah. Hallelujah, yes. Yes, so, you know, the case, you know, I can't promise you that he'sgoing to have the same response as other cases-- Aw. It's OK. So you're not sure that he can be saved? I'm not sure that he'll have the same response as other cases I've had. But here what we use for this is something called intravenous vitamin C therapy. What it does is it helps clear the body. And it helps improve the immune function and brings that inflammation down so that his body can start tofunction properly again. Then, you know, hopefully, we'llsee his appetite improve and be able to thrive from there. But we need to catch it now. You know, because of what I'm seeing, it crawled up his spine, he got the arched spine. And it's heading up to here. We don't want it to get to here. Because when it starts to get tohere, we start to see seizures. We start to see more serious things. OK. But, you know,we'll have to take it day by day and see how he does. I hate to ask what the cost is. I've spent so much money on this dog. Yeah, I see that. Typically, for a dog his size,it's 1,200 for the three days that they're on therapy. That's fine. That's fine. I don't care. So-- I'm working right now to pay for this dog. The only thing I need to do is call my husband. Of course. OK, so she'd like totake him and they give him, it's called a vitamin C therapy intravenously. And I would like to do it. It's going to cost $1,200,but I would like to do it. Are you still there? I do. And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. But I really want to feelwhen I go home that I've given him my best shot. So, yeah, we're gonna do a chest X-ray, bloodwork, a GHP/CBC, and a T4, actually, as well. And then he's staying over night. Ready? JACQUELINE Vitamin C works fantastic for somethinglike a vaccine reaction. Some people aren't readyfor something that bizarre as a treatment option. It's difficult, even for me, I've been doing this for 10 years now. And even for me, it's difficultto wrap my mind around it. And then all I have to do istreat a patient and I'm like, OK, you know, there's no way you can have placebo effect on a dog or a cat. But it's gonna be IVCtonight, tomorrow, and Friday. All right. Unless we see amiracle in the next four hours. Andsometimes it doesn't work. But usually we get at leastbetter energy and eating, even if we don't solve the disease. And you know, always that'sthe most important thing is just improve quality of life. But a lot of times, we get morethan just better quality of life, we really reverse things. All these new cases-- JACQUELINE Dr. Marty actually is the one that pioneered this in dogs and cats. He actually took the protocolthat was being used in humans and adapted it to pets. Back in the day when he started using it, there wasn't such a thing asinjectable, sterile vitamin C therapy. So what they used to do, I mean, this is crazy, but what they used to do isactually open the IV bag, pour vitamin C powder into thebag, and kind of shake it up to dissolve the powder. And he saw incredible response. How is he? It's hard to say. 1973, right after I graduated Cornell vet school, I was working in conventional veterinary medicine. I became a workaholic. And I was living on junk food. I always had heart burnand I always had headaches. And I became a very sickly person. I was diagnosed withchronic bursitis, arthritis. It seemed that if someone had a cold, I caught it. I'd go to my doctor and I said, what's going on? And he said, well, you are getting older. I was only 26 years old. And then he recommended antibiotics and long acting steroids. And when I said to him, isthere any other alternative? No answer. And that got me searching for answers that conventional medicine didn't offer. At that time, there was no suchthing as holistic medicine. I had to travel like 35 miles just to find a health food store. A little pumpkin seed oil. Yum! And I did a lot of research on the biological effectsof good food, acupuncture, homeopathy. Finally, I said, you know, I got to try this. Over time, everything went away. And that was the wake up call. What I learned is that myimmune system was dysfunctional. It's either suppressedor not working correctly. In medical school, we learned how to diagnose and treat disease. But we should also betreating the immune system. And it hit me. If this works for us, whywon't it work for an animal? Come on, buddy. Welcome to Smith Ridge. All right, I'm just going to get a little bit of information. I know we have the medical records. All right,the doctor will be right in. When he vomits, is it once a day? Sometimes 12 times at a time. Really? Yeah, it's a lot. Let's start with injectable homeopathics. OK. The last vet that I went to told me that I should start thinking about putting him on the medication. Then missing a dose, I hearit's fatal, I've been told. No, I find oftentimes, youknow, we don't have to go down the medication route. Great. What we want to do is feedthem the closest to what they would eat naturally. So for us that's raw diets-- 80% meat and 20% ground-up fiber. If I said this to the vetthat we used in the past, what would they say aboutwhat you're telling me? It depends. Because in vet school theydon't educate us on nutrition. He's a puppy. And we have to be carefulwith how much food-- In the US, there's only about 5% of practices that offer integrative care. Either the people who are studying sort of the holistic or alternative say, no, I don't want to do anything conventional. Or you have theconventional vet who says, no, absolutely no alternatives. It's OK to leave water down. So we get consults from all over the country. Well, my local vet is unwillingto do this so I'm calling you. So I'm first going to putin points that kind of help calm her. Because she's a little bit of a cranky girl. And I happen to love cranky cats. Most people come in andtell me that their friends are saying, you're crazy. You shouldn't be doing acupuncture on your pet. It's a bunch of crap. Until you sort of see it for yourself, you don't believe that it's possible. She's had a great response to it. I know you weregiven a very bleak prognosis. Yeah. Let's take a listen to you. Well, a consult is an hour. We're reviewing hundredsof pages of medical records sometimes for that particular appointment. I'm going to send you homewith supplements that have some anti-inflammatory benefit. It could take a little bit of time. But we're definitely goingto be able to help her. Well, she means the world to us. It is very, very rarethat we cannot offer some hope. And that doesn't necessarilytranslate into a cure, but it translates into somethingthat is fair to the animal and not do anything that is going to make them miserable while we're trying to extend their life. Thank you. Thanks. OK. I'm hoping he'll like my home-cooked stew. We'll see. Hey, honey. Am I bothering you again? You want to try something? Precious. What do you think? You wanna try that? Good boy. Good boy, honey. All right, I guess I got to get him more meat. Much better. Good boy. I like that I can't keep him still today. Where you going? Come here. So I'm seeing an improvement in the way he's using his right hind leg. So it's much stronger. Number one, he's puttingmore weight onto that side. And you'll notice he moves it faster than he was the first day, much faster. And he's also standing taller. So we've come actually a longway in the past couple days. His color's really good today. He's bright-eyed, eating, walking around. And he's wagging his tail. That's, you know, the beginningsof quality of life coming back. Hey. Hey, look at you! I haven't seen you wag your tail in so long. Look at that nice little wag I got out of you. What's my boy doing? You're acting like a dog. Here he comes right now. How's he doing? Walking around? He pulled me on the leashall the way down there. He pulled me all the way up there. And then a nurse had to comeout and say, look, you know, you're letting him do too much. We're going to get you better. Don't you worry. I'll do all the worrying for you. And there goes my life. Please give me a call back. Mulligan ishere for Dr. Goldstein. We got him as a puppy. And we didn't know anything was wrong until he just kept drinking water as a baby and just peed constantly. We went to a veterinarian clinic. It turned out he had compromised kidneys. And he was born with only 15%to 25% of healthy kidney tissue. Did they have the word renal dysplasia? Yes, that's it.- It's renal dysplasia? - Yeah. - Damn. And when we askedhow long Mulligan might last, they said could be a week,could be a couple of months. Really, it was a death sentence. So basically, he has a genetic or congenital predispositionfor his kidneys to fail. The kidney is responsiblefor getting rid of poisons from my body. So this is like a veritable time bomb. Because if he's functioningon 20% of the kidney and he suddenly goes down to 18%, he could start going into renal failure. yeah, it's all bad. Now, genetic predispositions cannot be changed. However, their ability to manifest as a disease can be altered. So if we work on hishealth and not the disease, we can help the body keep it in check. Right, OK. It's not more complicated than that. What are you feeding him right now? I'm told that hereally has to eat wet food. And he hates wet food, despises it. So I make stews and things. I like the fact that you're cooking. We're going to supplement the cooking with supplements and remedies. I'm going to give two injections today. And then we'll just do a routineblood test in a week or two. OK. If the kidney values are dropping or at least staying the same-- No, that'd be great. That's it. All right. I'm committed. Mulligan, we got work to do. We alwaystake blood on every patient, even if they're healthy,and put them on supplements based on deficiencies. And that's because nutritionis often the underlying problem in almost every case we see. Take a look at the main ingredients of the most popular pet foods, and what's the first thing you see? Corn-- not the bestingredient for a carnivore. And if you see the first ingredients is meat, you think it's the most prominent ingredient. But if you add up millet,brown rice, oatmeal, you'll see that 70%, 75% of the food is actually less expensive grain. I'mglad they made your Gaines Burgers with more real meat. Plus, in the '70s, we had the entire age of the semi-moist foods. You'll beglad we made them taste better. You take itout of the cellophane wrapper, you throw it in the bowl,you go over five days later and it's still moist? I was like, what? They had four or five chemicals,dyes, flavor enhancers. And guess what wasn't in there? It was devoid of food. And this is one of the reasons a dog as young as Mulligan is bornwith malfunctioning kidneys. So a supplement in the highest form should be a concentrated food to make up for the deficiencies in the food chain that we passed on to our pets. However, even thoughthere's scientific backing, supplements are not part of theeveryday veterinary protocol. But that's something we've beentrying to change for decades. Whisky, a 120-pound rottweilers, is the picture of health today. But six years ago, he was stricken with a bowel disease that'susually fatal for his breed. As far as I wasconcerned, the dog was dead. These are pictures of him then after two months at an animal hospital. He had wasted away to less than 60 pounds. Vets gave Whiskey just days to live. But his owner went knocking at the office of Dr. Martin Goldstein. Marty took one look at himand said I think I can save him. And I wouldn't believe it for one moment. We figure every animal hasa chance or deserves a chance. Wheretraditional veterinary medicine had failed, holistic medicine succeeded. Using homeopathicremedies and acupuncture, Dr. Goldstein had Whiskey on theroad to recovery within a week. To this day, I think it's a miracle. No miracle, says Dr. Goldstein, just nature at work. Trained in traditional medicine with a degree from Cornell University's Vet School, he's become convinced alternative medicine is the way to go. And while many traditionalvets recognize the benefits of what Dr. Goldstein practices, some do question what he preaches. Hey, babe. What? Come here. There's a guy that'swriting a blog about you. Whoa, Joey, wait. He says, "being learned and experienced in the use of unproven and quack therapies makes one an expert only ina narrow and fundamentally misleading sense. An expert on homeopathy islike an expert on astrology or a long dead religion." He's already madethe decision that it's bad. I know. Respond to him. I know. Well, it's a blog, I can't. It's a blog. Is he a vet? I think so. We should contact him andinvite him to Smith Ridge. There's this other thing that he says. He says I've talkedfrequently about the problem with concept of alternative medicine experts. They know a great deal about something fictional, but thisknowledge is only used for-- Over the years, I'vebeen called so many things-- snake oil salesman, charlatan. "He's not practicingaccepted veterinary medicine. He used to be a good veterinarian." About 20 years ago, I lecturedat Cornell, my alma mater, and I showed them all thesebefore and after pictures. It went in one ear and out the other. But now I have enough before and after cases where you don't have to be arocket scientist to realize, hey, we did something beneficialto the life of that dog. Dr. Jenna-- OK. This is Shadow. She has had significantarthritis for a couple years. And she's getting Magna Wave therapy. All right, this is gonnafeel a little strange, kiddo. So it's basically a very strong wave using magnets. And what it does is it pulsesthe electromagnetic field through the tissue. And as it pulses, it increasesthe blood flow to the area. And if we're doing that, we're decreasing the inflammation to helprelieve some of the pain. Good girl. - I - can understand Marty's frustration over the years. My father's a chiropractor. And I remember growing up in that environment where people are like, whatdo you mean chiropractor? Or what do you mean, you know, supplements? Or what do you mean good diet? And they would look at you. And they're like, that's not medicine. So I watched my father goingthrough all of the same things that I hear Marty talking about. Marty, OK if I turn out the lights for a second? Yeah. All right, let's take a look here, kid Good girl. It's OK. Growing up Inever imagined that being a vet would be all this medication. I imagined it would be doingthe same thing for pets. So that was the hardest challenge for me, was getting out of school and being like, I have to go work in conventional medicine where there was an expectation that I would treat conventionallyacross the board. And if I didn't treat with all the medications that they thought wasappropriate, I got in trouble. It was hard because you were always covering up a disease with medicine. You were never getting tothe basis of what was wrong. And then a very dear friend of mine was like, there's a positionover at Smith Ridge. Why don't you go over there? I was like, what's Smith Ridge? Looked it up and found out that this was a practice that was doing exactly what I dreamed of doing. I know that's the sore part right there, right in your shoulder. But it comesdown again to a single practice versus, you know, having it asmore of a standard of medicine. Good girl. Well, I tell you, for mewhen somebody first brought up a holistic vet, to me, I was like what, so they can take grassand rub it all over my dog and get my dog better? There's 190 million registered dogs and cats owned by 67% of thefamilies in the United States. And the scary thing is, one out of two of them could die of cancer. We've got increased rates of cancer, diabetes, you know, you name it,whether it's a person or a pet. It's all degenerative diseases now. Yeah, so in 1997, I had a patient and she moved from my practicein Los Angeles to New York. And a mutual friend called meone day and said, you know, did you hear she got tied upwith this crazy veterinarian who's charging her, like, a ton of money for vitamins and herbs and herdog has cancer, has cancer. And he's telling you you can treat cancer with diet and herbs. And I was incensed. I was so angry. So I thought, well, I'll getthis guy's license revoked. I'll get him out of ourprecious profession, right? So I called him. I called him on the phone. And I wanted to find outwhat his shtick was, right? So I said, I hear you cure cancer. And I expected him to say something that I could nail him on. And he said, no, we don't cure cancer. I said, but I thought you treated cancer. And he said no. He said what we do is we actually support the immune system. And when you make the immune system stronger, sometimes really amazing things happen. And I went, that's how he gets away with it. That's how he gets away with it. So I'm like, hey, would you mind if I came out sometime and just, like, saw how your practice works? And he immediately said yes. So I flew to New York, go to his practice. And I thought there was goingto be a bunch of hippies, you know, all walking around,smoking dope, and hugging. And the hugging part is true. So he presents case after case after case of all these cancer patientsthat are getting better. And remember that paralyzeddog from Northern Colorado? Yeah, so this dog came fromthe biggest neurologist in the United States, failed on this case, said it was a hopeless case. Marty sticks like 12 needlesin this dog and the dog gets up after being paralyzedfor like three months, gets up and walks over and puts his head in the lap of the owner. And so the only thing I could do is, I'm here to destroy this guy. He just did the biggestmiracle of my entire career. I actually fainted. You passed out. And so when I woke up, I hada completely different view. So I changed my practice. I changed the way I did medicine. I started helping moreanimals and using fewer drugs. And the science is coming out now. I mean, we have a study that'sshowing markedly improved survival time for cancer patients who receive the best of Western cancer therapy and the best of integrative medicine. This is not snake oil. But there still is a wall of resistance. The whole point of integrative medicine is it's part of medicine. DrGoldstein, your appointment is in room two. So the breeder gavehim one vaccine at eight weeks. Right. You did one at 13 and 1/2 weeks. And now I'm under theimpression that we should do the parvo this third time. Yeah. But after that we have a thing called a titre. OK. A titre is a blood test that measures the level of immunity generatedby the previous vaccine. And if it's positive, he's mostlikely protected against parvo. OK. And we can titre for mostvaccines throughout his life. And if he's immune, youdon't have to worry about it. OK, I like that. But rabies is a different story. Because rabies vaccines are mandated by state and federal law. OK. Now if there wasn't a tiebetween the immunosuppressive effects of the vaccines and allthe cancer and other diseases we're seeing, I wouldn't be talking about this. One ofthe most controversial issues I've been fighting for isthe proper administration of vaccinations. That's the American Veterinary Medical Association, the governing bodyover the entire profession. "Vaccines and Sarcomas, aConcern for Cat Owners." The tumor grows at the site of the vaccine. Because most cats get thevaccine between the shoulder blades. So now the recommendationis vaccinating the cat in the rear legs. Well, now they're even trying the tail so that when the tumor grows, you could remedy the situation by amputation. And it's not only the vaccine,it's not only the organism, but the thing that makesthe vaccine more powerful called the adjuvant. And adjuvant is typically achemical put into a vaccine. It causes an inflammatory reaction at the site of the injection. So the vaccine gets absorbedquicker into the body so it builds up a higher level of immunity. Another concern is over vaccination. Because the typical puppywould get a series of three when they're young-- eight weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks. After that, many veterinariansvaccinate every year. The dose is one vial pipette, regardless of weight, age, or breed. But also the vaccine could be up to 10 times the potency needed tochallenge the immune system of a Great Dane. And the same dose is givento the two-pound chihuahua. And it's been scientifically proven that one vaccination can generate immunity that lasts many years. So if your pet is due, haveyour veterinarian take a titre. And if a dog has a positivetitre against, let's say, distemper or parvo, then they're not "due" just because the calendar says. So I'm not saying that I'm anti-vaccine. I'm pro-sanity. All right, come on. He was definitely runninga fever all weekend. He was drinking from the bowl. But now he doesn't evenwant to drink from the bowl. And he's not eating. So I'm force feeding him water and food. What's hisenergy been like at home? He doesn't want to do anything. All he does is sleep. And he did lose alittle bit of weight as well. I thought they said he increased. No, no. No, he's down a little bit. No, I think you're doing agood job with the nutrition. It's he's just not absorbing. It seems like I'm feeding something. I'm feeding him. But it's not getting to him. OK. Tell me more about thesituation where he came from. You know, he originally came from Arkansas, and then he went where from there? He was abandonedon the side of the road with his mother, a brother, and a sister. And he was the smallest of the three. But the two of them are healthy. OK. And he how did he come here? He was delivered here by some delivery truck? Or how did he come here? I'm assuming. All right, all right. So let's turn over other stones as a possibility of what's going on here. With Waffles, more things sort of came to light that didn't really fit just a rabies vaccine reaction. When you have a patient who isso complicated, so much going on and you don't have a diagnosis, then you start to dig a littlebit more for the rare things. You're trying to solve a mystery. That mystery changes on a daily basis, sometimes on an hourly basis. It's almost like a Sherlock Holmes process. He is coming up positive forthe fungal infection called Blastomycosis. It's a rare disease in our area. So it's not on your radar. So I have a feeling what happened was he came from thisvery difficult situation. He was exposed to this fungus at some point. Then he got a vaccine and it challenged his immune system too much. And then everything kind oftook off from from there. So what do I do? Essentially, what we need to do is get him on an antifungal medication, and then track his blood work. This can be a very long-term treatment. OK. The medicationis pretty hard on the body. So at some point, I wouldwant to do a C on him really to help him more withthe medication than anything. Because his immune system is working. It just needs help. PET OWNER : What do you rate his chances of survival? It is a very vicious organism. It can go to the heart andthe brain and the eyes. He can go blind. I'm hoping that we can catch up to it. You did it! He definitely has a fever. Yeah, he's puttingout heat like a furnace right now. You're gonna beat this, Waffles. Whether you're a person or an animal, it doesn't matter, being in a hospital sucks. And if they are alone andthey're feeling like shit and there's no reason for them, they don't feel like a dog or a cat anymore, they're just too down, what do they have? They don't do that in hospitals with people. There is the staff there all the time in and out waking you up, checking you, checking your line. So why wouldn't we do with ananimal that doesn't even have an idea of why they're here? You're OK. You're OK. They don't understandwhat's happening to them. So you have to remember that,especially when it gets crazy. Because there are plenty of times we're crying on each other's shoulders. I guess if you want to compare it to human medicine, licensed technicians, we are the registered nurses. But then on top of that,we're also the phlebotomist, the x-ray technician, dental hygienist, the person who places the catheters, the surgical assistant. And we are the anesthesiologist. Come on, Crystal. Wake up, sweetie. Come on, Crystal. Hello. Two, three. It's definitely not a glamorous job. And it's a very physicallyhard, taxing job. We had 144-pound dog here yesterday. And had he been aggressive, it turns a whole new twist on things. But we still keep in mind, thisis a scared animal coming in. They're just trusting us. We're old friends, right Joe? Sometimes it's likebeing in a kid's daycare. That's a good boy. Hello, love. All right. Mulligan is here for Dr. Goldstein. How is he? He's 100%. He sleeps all through the night. He now does not pee every three hours. He can hold almost six hours. Such a good sign. And I'm always ready tolook on the floor in front of the refrigerator because that's his spot where he always pees, and it's dry. Amazing to me. What you'redescribing is great signs. So today blood work. I'm going to give him his favorite injections. I'll make adjustments if needed. OK. You brought the urine in. I did, fresh, the first catch of the day. Yeah, which is really good. This is very exciting. You know, everything I've learned from conversationsand from seeing him, it's a whole new process of thinking. But what I don't understandis why this hasn't caught on in a very big way. It's so obvious. I mean, once you get it, it's so obvious. Welcome to the struggle of my life. Let me examine Sir Mulligan. His disease hopefully is a thing of the past. I had no idea what Dr. Marty would look like or be. And when I met him, he's like, you know, an adorable hippie about 25 years too old for the clothes he's wearing. But they work somehow. Like a flying nun. Flying nun. I know. I know. I know. Hey. My god. My god. What attracted you to Marty? He made me laugh. And that was a huge quality. Because it's just, we just liketo laugh about, like, stupid stuff all the time. Well, when we go out-- when we go out to dinner orwe go someplace with the kids, she introduces the four of us as her children. I'd like you to meet my children. Yes. My youngest. Right, right. We have three girls, teenagers, four dogs, one 20-year-old cat. We have two lizards. And we have a parakeet. We have a bunny. We have eight chickens. I'm not sure if we have more animals at home or at the clinic. Come on, Red. Red, come on. Working together, it's not always, you know, peaches and cream. But we've always believedthat if you're working towards the same goal, then it doesn't matter who goes what direction. Let's just get there. Exactly. When we first started to date, she used to come over to my house. My animals liked her better than me. And I watched that, even at the clinic, I watched how she had a way with animals or they had an affinity for her. That's when I first startedat Smith Ridge back in 1996. That was the old one, the shack. The old Smith Ridge clinic. Officially known as "the shack." Becauseintegrative medicine was not an accepted modality, it was hard for me to work at that standard veterinary hospital. So I wound up having to go out on my own. And in 1982, my first practice was a kennel that I rented space in. Because that's all I could afford. My exam room became my surgery room. Our bathroom wasthe X-ray developer room. So if somebody wasdeveloping an X-ray film, you couldn't use the bathroom. You couldn't bathroom. So whenwe started to get patients, people would walk into thisplace, they would look around, and they would ask if they had the wrong address. Boy, we've come a long way. Long way. Wow. Wow. --be quick,and pick-up time is generally between 4:30 and 5:00. when he wakes up. SmithRidge, this is How can I help you? - I'm Dr. Shane. - Hi, Dr. Shane. - Hi there. - I'm Jennifer. - Hi there. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi, Petey. All right. So tell me about theconsults that you've had. - Well, he's been to five vets. - OK. And it all started when he got shots on a Wednesday. I he had a tumor on Friday. And then I brought him backto the vet on Saturday. He never had it before. It was a lump.- And he was drooling crazy. And he had a runny nose after the shots, like a few days later. So he had a reaction. So he was vaccinated withoutany discussion about it? They're like, he's duefor this, this, and this. And I was kind of like, all right, get her done while I'm here. And then not realizing, they, you know-- They gave him the flu shot,the kennel cough vaccine-- They gave him a flu, a lep-- Leptospirosis, right. And a kennel. Would that trigger that to make it grow or-- I can't imagine thatthat happened in just 48 hours. That's what all the other vets said. But it's hard for me not to believe it. Right. So then I went back. She said I don't knowwhat's wrong with his mouth. Then he went to New Jersey with her. He goes on vacation, this dog. OK, that's awesome. So then he wentto a vet in New Jersey. And he called a week laterand said that it was cancer. Yeah. OK. They said they would mostlikely have to remove his jaw and he would be deformed. I said, no, just, you know,let me just think about it. And then I met a woman in the park. And she said, did youtalk to Marty Goldstein. Because he'll do anythingnot to cut it out. And I don't know what her namewas, just a woman at the dog park told me about you. OK. All right, let's get a good look at you. You wanna lay down, honey? Go ahead, lay down. You're the best. You're the best patient. Plus, the sore is on this side. Yeah, OK. Here, it's over here. All right, mom. They said the tumor is inside by his tongue. Without sedation, itwould be hard to really see the whole thing.- See, there it is right there. Gosh, he is so good. There it is right there. What a dog. My god. I have to assume that-- Petey, it's OK. --that the tumor iscompletely infiltrating his jaw. So I'm definitely going toget Dr. Goldstein involved. I want him to take a look. I want him to give me his opinion on doing something for Petey's jaw. Whoa. And then open up your jaw, Petey. Hang on, buddy. I just wanna get behind him. That's extensive. It doesn't really seem painful. He's got it all the way back here. I know. Yeah, there's somenecrotic tissue in there. Ooh, smelly. OK, Petey, I know. Well, we could at least do amajor debulking of the cancer mess using cryosurgery. They want to do hemimandibulectomy? That's what has been recommended repeatedly. She said, I've decided I don'twant to do traditional surgery. I'll come in with you. OK, all right. I have been workingat a traditional practice for about 15 years. And Dr. Ruskin who I hadworked with at another practice had been desperately trying toget me to come to Smith Ridge. But it didn't feel like the right fit for me. I thought it was going to be too holistic. I had a lot of preconceivednotions about it. Marty, what would you like to use? Adrenal B12 and what else? And then Marty started calling me. And they were tag teaming me to come in. And I said OK. But I was nervous about meeting him. I didn't think I was going to like him. Because I had seen some of his medical records just from casesthat we had shared and seen this list of supplements. And I thought, this is so ridiculous. I mean, it's just so long. And how could anybody evertake all of these supplements? And how could he possibly even know about all these supplements? I don't think the homeopathicis going to do anything. The adrenal B12-- But I met with him and he was completely different fromwhat I expected him to be. And I remember he said to me,so what do you want to do? Who do you want to be? Do you want to be someonewho does this work? And my answer was yes. Dr. Jenna, your 1 o'clock phone is on line one. OK, this is a very difficult case. Cancer grows exponentially. If the replication rate of acancer cell is every four hours and you have a tumor that'scomposed of billions of cells, it could create billionsof cells every four hours. And I've had people tell me that they have sat home over the weekend and watched their dogs tumor double. Radiation is an option. They're not going to go for it. Removing that whole jaw is an option. They're not going to go for it. So let's talk about cryosurgery. With cryosurgery, weactually freeze the tumor. And the freezing actually stimulates the immune system so thatwhatever cancer we freeze will get rejected. And then the body will lay down new scar tissue where the cancer used to be. But we save enough vital tissuefor functionality of the jaw. Coming from a traditional background, I can't even conceive of this kind of success. Think about it. You get your finger frost bit. The part that really got frostbit will die. The part that almost got frostbit will form a wall ofdefense, a wall of defense and reject the other piece. That's what we want to do with cryosurgery. But at this stage, we are verytime-limited with this case. If we don't docryosurgery and they don't choose the other options-- There is nothing else to offer them. Nothing, yeah. We don't like hemimandibulectomies where you remove the whole jaw. Unless it's the only thingthat can save a dog's life. This one I would actually consider, but I know you don't want to go there. If he will-- I mean, I had made the decision not to take the tumor out. I didn't want to have the surgery. And I didn't want him to be deformed. And I didn't want him to go through the pain. Yeah, the thing that makes this tough is the location and thesize and the firmness of it. All of this cancer I know I can freeze and the body will reject it. It's what's growing inside the jaw. Yeah, it's this onehere and getting exposure. I'm sure at least one or two of the teeth, at least are going to have tocome out to give me exposure. We don't care about thatas long as he has the jaw. Yeah. It's like a gamble. It's like a 50/50 shot pretty much. It's probably less than that. But would nutritionalsupplements let it grow slower maybe or stop it from growing? I don't think so. This is a tough one. And if we elect to do cryo,it's gonna be a long haul. OK. OK. I got to sleep on it, I guess. Yeah, a lot to think about. We will. It was a pleasure. Yeah. Pie-poo. He's been to five veterinarians. And no one ever mentionedthat before, except a stranger in the park, the dog park. Because I could havebeen here two months ago. Because it was so extensive at that point, the family decided to give Peteythe best life that they could for whatever time he had left without any surgical intervention. He didn't suffer. And when it was time, they put him to sleep. You just never know how you're going to handle a situation until you are the one who's actually in it. And I certainly-- I certainly don't think that it would be fair orright to judge that they should have done anything differently. Scooby is ready to go back. What, baby, what? Tell mama. What's ailing you? You'll be OK. Yes, you'll be OK. I know. Scooby is another patient that came in with a poor prognosis. The case is very, very similar to Petey. And the owners came here looking for cryosurgery. And they got here just in time. OK. Scooby's tumor is getting worse. He's not eating much. In five days, he probably ate two times. His original veterinariantold me that he had about four months to live. This is our tank of liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen can get downto minus 99 degrees centigrade. Kind of feel like. Yeah. Stay clear. Cryosurgery is not a sterile surgery. We don't have to go into the sterile room. And I can just wear a scrub suit. Wow. There is a lot more involved here than we originally thought. And approaching it is going to be difficult. Once they start to freeze, it freezes quickly because it's so cold. You can see all the freezing going on. Can you see it, thefreezing travelling down. Yeah, wow. It's amazing? When I first heard about cryosurgery, I thought that it soundedbarbaric and crazy. And how could you freeze these tumors? And wait, the dog eats the same night? Hasn't eaten in two weeks,and all of a sudden you freeze the tumor and they eat that night and doesn't need a tremendousamount of pain medication. And, like, it's crazy. It's getting all the way down to there. Wow. In general, as great as cryosurgery is, surgery does not cure cancer. It removes a symptom of immune deficiency. This is going to hopefully save the jaw, buy us time so the nutritionalsupplements will work. In all likelihood, Marty, he's going to need more than one procedure? Yeah. Yeah, we're out. Scooby, how is he doing? He's wide awake in the cage. Now we got to see. Because the only thing we don'thave with cancer is prediction. We have to monitor them like a hawk. If he's going to growback cancer in two weeks, there's not much we're going to do, not with the way I froze it. And if this is a fibrous tumor, it could come back with a vengeance. We just don't know. I know you were worried aboutit, but he did really well. Aw. I'll just be there to see you, guys. He makes it look like.. Tell mom. You're gonna be OK. So we're here today for Scooby's recheck with Dr. Marty. He has gained three pounds. He's energetic. He's a lot stronger than hewas before the operation. He's running. He's back to his old self. Just eating is a bit of a problem. But Dr. Marty suggested toget a Boston Market chicken. And that did the trick. And he eats one everyday, 1 and 1/2 sometimes. The surgery site is right here. And they removed his tooth. And Dr. Marty doesn't wantus to clean the wound site. He wants the bacteria in there so the body fights harder to fight off the cancer. So everything you would think todo, you're not supposed to do. He just gave him two homeopathic shots. So he said that shouldgive him even more energy. So I guess he's OK. And he bounces back. It's all worth it. Yes. I got invitedby the Integrative Veterinary Medicine Club to give apresentation at, of all places, my alma mater, Cornell. So this time, I'll talk to the next generation. And I'm hoping those new vets coming out will start to spread this word. The days of paper. I mean, I haven't seenthese folders in umpteen years. You want to do the cryo? You want to do the cancer? You want to do the nutrition? Abigail, I want to dobecause that was verified. You should definitely talk about this one. You ran this case? This was the mast cell tumor they wanted to amputate the leg. We did cryosurgery. And then she lived to like I think 16 or 17. Wow, that's a great cancer case. Lyme disease, renal failure. Do we have anything with the nutrition? Brutus. - Aw. - Brute. He was diagnosed with Cushing's when he was 18 months old, oneof the youngest I've ever seen. And we got him to almost 17. Yeah. Who is that? Thea. Thea. She was the catthat looked like Jay Leno. She was 4 and 1/2 years old. Every joint in her body was fused. This was literally living rigor mortis. And one injection of a homeopathic remedy, and two hours later she was normal. And then she lived to like 14--MEG: My god. 14 and 1/2. Yeah, why don't you makea pile, so that's a given? Yeah. So that you can later on make notes. That's a good idea. Waffles is back. Waffles. He's unsteady on his feet. And he's not drinking or eating. When she gets her up in the morning, she kind of has to like let him balance out before they start walking. OK. All right. Sweetheart, let's see. So we have a bit of drama with Waffles. He's pretty weak. He looks pale. He's jaundiced. It's either some sort of autoimmune thing that's happening, a possiblevaccine reaction that's ongoing, or his blastomycosis,which has been knocking him off his feet for months now. All right, sweetie pie. All right, you can go back in with your mom. is that his blood spinning, Cath, or his is running in the machine? His should be running. OK. He's a moving target. Dr. Jenna, line one. It's bizarre. He is severely anemic right now. Wendy, Wendy, can you let her know that I have an emergency here,so it's going to be a wait. His red blood cells are reading at 20%. OK, but that's a good thing? They should be at least 30%. OK. And I think that we're goingto have to bite the bullet and do a blood transfusion. Then we can decide what to do from there, depending on his response. But blood is not somethingwe have in the hospital. We have to go and get it from another hospital. So I'm going to try to call around to see who could give us blood. Because we don't have a lot of time here. You think he'sstrong enough to withstand it? Yeah, I've seen a couple ofdogs that I look in their eyes and they're quitting. But most of them fight. And they're willing to keep trying. And he's trying, so Iwon't give up until Waffles tells me to give up. All right. OK. Dr. Ruskin here has determinedthat he needs a transfusion. Then she asked me to callto see if you have a unit of blood cells. One of our doctors hasdetermined that our patient needs a blood transfusion. And she's having us call around and see if we can get that for him. We don't have any blood here. That's why we're calling you guys. Yes. Apparently, all the blood banks are on back order and stuff. Yeah, all right. I don't really have enough time. We're gonna have to. But I think that's ouronly choice at this point. This is crazy. All right, who had blood? Newtown had blood? Newtown has one unit. So why don't we go there. OK, so I should just go. - Just go there. - OK. All right. Well, hopefully this is going to do it today. After the blood transfusion, I went back to the emergency room the next morning, bringing him his food which I made up. I deliver it there at 6 o'clock. And they came in, they broughthim in, and he was yellow. He was absolutely yellow. And I was horrified. And that's when they had thediscussion with me, well, you know, you got yourself a lemon here. And following that was thediscussion that he would be lame for the rest of this life. And Dave and I should give somethought to putting him down. Come on, you want to sit in the sun? So I called Smith Ridge, and Dr. Ruskin said we needto give him a few days. Let me take a look at him. And if he keeps on fighting,I'll keep fighting with him. Boy, you were hungry. Are you ready to go to work? Look at his ears, you know? Look how alert he is. Yeah. Yes. Yes, who loves you? Who loves you? Yes. Come on. What? Come on. What? You're like a normal dog. He is back to the way he was. Hey, Waffles. Yeah. That's amazing. Isn't that nice? He's playing, he's eating on his own. Aw. Kisses, yeah. You little fighter, you. My god. It's so great to see thattail wagging, get a kiss. My god, those kisses areworth a million dollars to me. Waffles. You did so good. You're the moocher now. Good boy. All right, so we just gotta check his blood, see if that's alsofollowing everything else great that we're seeing here. We'll be back. Look who's here. Yes, I know. He's so much bigger. I know, look at this. - No ribs! - Look at this. No ribs. Just PCB/CBC? PCB/CBC, yeah. Good news, 36. 36. 36. He's in the normal range. - Is it? - Yes. All right. My god, here come the tears again. Here, this boy. OK, 36. And everything is going, justblossoming into a puppy again. You're only going home with one new thing. What is it? The BH? Yep, that's you're one new thing. Yeah, that's you're one new thing. I'll give you a little bit. Because it's a homeopathic. It absorbs into the gums. So yeah, 20 months before and after food. Got it. All righty. How cute. Well, I know it's alittle big for him, but-- He'll grow into it. Scooby is ready to go back. Hi, buddy. He acts like there's nothing wrong with him. Still doing two walks a day, two long walks. He wants to go to Home Depot. He wants to go to the super market. He just wants to go out the door. Yeah, he wants to live. Yeah. Look how big it got. He's such a good boy. Who's a good boy? It's that and it'ssomething in the back as well. OK. Well, we have recurrencehere, a little over there. Yeah. But for a bone tumor six months later-- That's incredible. It's beyond. And his lymph nodes, which werehuge when we first started, I can barely palpate them now. I know. I didn't feel it either. I thought the same thing. Here, amazing. Wait a minute, where is it? How is that possible? It's remarkable. Not cured, but phenomenal. I'm going to cryo. Meow. Meow. What I always say is that stability in the face of expected declineis actually improvement. Metastatic bone cancer, if youlook in the references, weeks to live. We're going over half a year. He had one major cryo the first time. He had a very tiny touchup I think six weeks later. And now this is the third. People say, well, that's a lot of surgeries. But when you realize, typicalradiation therapy for cancer could be 16 to 25 radiations every day for four or five weeks under general anesthesia for 30 or 40 minutes. So four anesthetic proceduresover six or seven months is not that bad. It's less invasive. It's usually less bleeding. It usually requires less anesthetic. We do a lot of tumors undera local where normally they'd have to be put under anaesthesiafor 45 minutes to cut it out. It's the only form of surgerythat's known to be immune stimulating, tissue sparing. Why this is not standard operating procedure in all thehospitals in the United States is beyond me. The other good thing about it is his quality of life is so amazing. And that's what it's about. But I want to save thesebiopsies because somewhere along the line, sometotally conventionally based veterinarian will say that itwas probably missed diagnosed and never was a cancer. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Yeah? OK. Do I get a kiss, too? Give your mommy a kiss. Do I get kisses? Only daddy gets kisses? No, are you kidding me? All right, how are we going? People are always like, howmuch is this going to cost you? Or just euthanize, euthanize,I said you take him, you look at him in the eyes. And you want to euthanize him? No, no, no, he looks good,even his fur looks really good. It starts looking good right away. He's been through a lot of surgeries. But he bounces back. Two days later, he's jumping in the lake. He's not suffering at all. That's why we're doing what we're doing. Because he's really showingthat he's got that strength in him, that he's fighting. When his original vet saidfour months, he's going to die, I just thought that therewas nothing we could do. And that was a year ago already. He's gonna start tossing sand towards me. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to buzz through the whole thing. Do you want me to stop you if I see something that I think should be out?- No, make notes. Do you want me to make-- like, just go over it again. Make notes and then we'll go over it later. Because I want to kind of time it too. Then stopwatch. So you ready? Yeah. All right, let's get intosome real good stuff now. This is a book about how the pyramids were built. At the same time that this was done, acupuncture was laid down. Pet food, whole grain corn,whole grain wheat, the dogs in nature eat at bakeries? There's the tumor. We infuse it with lidocaineor marcaine and we freeze it. So cryosurgery is real medicine. Stop. You have to kind ofswitch gears a little bit. You know, a lot of times you talked like you were talking to like a general public, not a veterinary student. They want to know how you made this dog better How did you make this cat better? And what did you specifically use? I can't teach you integrativemedicine in 35 minutes. But that's why I think youshould take three to four cases and basically do a rundown. Like with Thea, you did a great job because you actually said I gave her an injection, a homeopathicremedy called Zeel and it worked. The next three animals may not respond to Zeel. But see, that's what you need to say. What did you put them on? Individual supplementation program according to their blood work. They are all individual, different animals. They might not like that because when they learn medicine, they arebeing taught everything works. This drug will create this thing. But you're proving itdoesn't, because they're all coming in after being on drugs. These dogs, yes, went throughall the antibiotic courses that they were recommended. They went on steroids. They were on surgery list. They were on this. But now you have to show themthat why my therapy worked is because I used this. Hi, baby. Here we go. Hey, here we go. Come on. Mulligan is here for Dr. Goldstein. This is Mulligan's results. Creatinine, last time it was 45. Two points up. Wait, is that good? That's great. It's gone down. Yeah. But the good one ishematocrit, 42 is normal, and hemoglobin in the normal range. It's the enigma, AKA Mulligan. You know, I've gone back to our local vet and told them about this. And the particularsurgeon has been stunned. She's really-- she just keepslooking at him and saying, I can't get over-- how could this happen? He is fabulous. We are responsibly addressinghis condition as well as we can with no side effects. She can be doing this too. I, you know, I'm not just grateful. I'm just like, I feel likeif ever he should fail, I had all this gift. It's really a gift. No, now we're going into years. Yeah. Hey, Mull. Hey, Mully, we're talking about you. He thinks you're crazy. He thinks you're crazy so he never reacts to you appropriately. Right, Mulligan. Or maybe that is appropriate. From the very firstsession, Dr. Marty didn't say we can cure this dog. He said he couldn't cure the dog. But he said he could extend his wellness. And by so doing, dog himself will be able to work on his own problems and hopefully get more life. I'm not against anything holistic. I just never had tried anything like that. But his changes have been so visible. Seeing the difference, I startedexploring this kind of concept holistically for human beings where they test blood and change everything according to what you need. I have the worst diet in the world. I eat chocolate and Diet Pepsiand bacon and all of the above. So I've scaled back on the kindsof not so good for you foods. And then I started supplements. And now I'm never tired. I've lost a certain anxiety. I'm much calmer. But I still eat bacon. I can't help it. Does he seem better today? I think he seems about the same. As yesterday? As yesterday. Yeah. How's his kidney values? Did they run more blood? We haven't rechecked the values. We're scheduled to do that this afternoon. OK. We'll try to keep him comfortable. It's so surprising how it came on so fast. Dr. Ruskin, I'm so upset. Aw, honey. I don't want to lose him. I know it. I know it. All of this, you know, rightnow I think all of this is secondary to kidney infection. But for now, we're just kindof supporting him, flushing him, keeping him hydrated. You know, having a kidney infection is really exhausting, painful. It really throws your body into a tailspin. You think we're at the point where, well, you don't know whathis quality of life will be. I don't know. Yeah, I mean, if I can getthe infection under control, he could pull through this and be fine. If he continues to declinedespite what we're doing, you know, then it's not good. All right. All right. OK, stay right here. Take your time. You OK? Take your time. It's all right. Oftentimes with patients, they have a way of speakingto you and telling you that they're done fighting. The body kind of makes the decision for you. And you just know when you look at the pet. The disease, the blastomycosis that he has finally gained access to his kidneys and caused kidney failure. So we all sort of came to theconclusion at the same time that it was time to stop trying. I really do fall in love withevery patient that I have. And letting them go is extremely difficult. Look at you standingthere like such a big girl. You're so adorable. There is definitelyan emotional connection. It's hard to actually thinkabout how attached I get. That's probably what makes me a good vet and also what tortures me. And I sometimes wish I would lose that quality because it would be easier. But I really don't want to. Hi there, who's the best girl? It's OK, love. You'rethe one holding that life and death in your hands. And I know there are other oldervets that I know who actually won't euthanize anymore. They pass it off to their other associates because it's too hard for them to do. And I can understand that as well. Year after year after year there is a toll. And it's not just an injection, it is-- there is a life and abeing and a consciousness. And we're the ones left withthe aftermath and the pain associated with that. So that's probably the hardest part of my job. The day Waffles passed, Dr. Marty came in and spoke withus about the death of a pet. While he was talking to us, I started to think about all the other veterinarians who said to me, where you're going is a load of crap. It's not an easy leap to make. I think it's an easier leapif it involves a person. But I think a lot of peoplehave a second thought because they're like,well, it's just an animal. But my opinion was that he was just a puppy and he deserved to live his life. All DrRuskin's patient, please. Manyanimals that I've worked on, we've taken past the pointof conventional medicine. Even if they don't make it, whatI always say is in your heart when you made that choice to try this, you made it to do the best thing you could. We try to get our patientsa better quality of life, quantity usually accompanies quality. A dog will come here with five weeks to live. And we struggle, and we work, and we do cryo. And we're on supplements. And we're taking blood. Two years later, the tumor isstill there and this and that, and the people say, do you think it's working? Yeah, he had five weeks to live two years ago. There it is. I love this pin. So I used to sit here 48 years ago. That was me, 1973. Now there's 190 million registered cats and dogs in the United States. So we see many, many animals. They come in young. We do a minimal vaccine program. We put them on a good diet. When they're a year old, we take blood, we put them on supplements. And they'll live to 14, 16,18, and sometimes beyond that. You want to be skeptical, you can. But this is the future ofwhere our profession is going. All right, let's cut to the chase. Cryosurgery, this dog was referred to me. And I asked the one oncologistwhat his prognosis was. And he said probably five months. That's me freezing the tumor. Two weeks later, five weekslater, four and a half months. That's seven and a half months. Last thing we heard was the dog was still alive eight years later. The referring veterinarianreferred to me as a kook when he found out about cryosurgery. This is what I'm trying to break through. This is the package insert. And every vaccine intended foruse in healthy animals only. I am not anti-vaccine. We standardly vaccinate all the time. But this is a case I took on twomonths ago, 9 and 1/2 year old dog from Virginia. Tested positive for three diseases this veterinarian diagnosed,and then gave the dog a DHPP, lepto, and Lyme vaccine. Why do you take a dog with three diseases and challenge their immunesystem at the same time with six more diseases? This unfortunately isstandard operating procedure, and in my opinion, malpractice. Because it's violating what the drug companies say. Vaccinate healthy animals only. All right, let's look at a miracle case. Let's look at what'scausing immune suppression. Let's look at glandular therapy, injectable homeopathic remedies, supplements, intravenous vitamin C, thevalidity of acupuncture in veterinary medicine. Who's got a question? So obviously there's not a whole lot of this in our official curriculum here at the vet school. So how would you recommendus as future veterinarians go about learning all this information and these different treatment options? The one good thing right now is you have society in your favor. You have crazy people like me that are out there that are showing this. And the bandwagon ismoving in this direction. Society is finally starting to listen. Question. Do you think it's more weneed scientific information, more scientific studies? Or do you think that the yearsof data that we already have is good enough to make that change, and now it's just a policy kind of issue? What a great question. My number one criticism over my career, if your cases are so great,why haven't you published? Why haven't you documented? I'm a clinician. Animals are coming to me from all over the United States withreally distraught families. I'm not going to take nine cases of lymphoma, put three on alternatives,put three on chemo, and put three on a placebo. That's not me. So my hope in my lifetime isfor me and other integrative veterinarians to work inconjunction with a facility like Cornell to get science-based evidence that integrative medicine works. You're not going against what you're studying, you're incorporating more. So I so appreciate you guys coming today. Thank you. Start the bandwagon rolling. I'm a first-year. So I just started three weeks ago. I don't know very much yet. But I'm really glad that Ifound this during my first year. Because now I have the wholerest of my first year and all the other years still that I can explore it and learn more about it. - I - honestly never thought that I would see the acceptanceof my work within my lifetime. So it's becoming excitingfor me now because we have an audience that'll listen. I set myself up for ahell of a lot of hardship. It's not been easy. But if I gave up knowing that this can be done and this could be accepted,that would kill me. Because picture the dog andpicture the cat in your house wagging its tail andlicking your face and how good that makes you feel. It's incredible. And we need that. Because we don't wag our tails enough. No, they do this sevendays a week, 24 hours a day except when they're sleeping. So if I can make the companion animals better and they can bring us more joy-- what? How much more of a win can you have in life? Red! Red! I lovemy dog as much as I love you. But you may fade, my dogwill always come through. All he asks from me is thefood to give him strength. All he ever needs is love. And that he knows he'll get. So I love my dog as much as I love you. But you may fade, my dogwill always come through. All the pay I need comesa-shining through his eyes. I don't need no cold water tomake me realize that I love my dog as much as I love you. But you may fade, my dogwill always come through. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. I love my dog as much as I love you. But you may fade, my dogwill always come through. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na! Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na! I love my dog. Baby, I love my dog. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. I said I love my dog. Baby, I love my dog. Baby, I love my dog. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
