Buongiorno. - Can I have eight of the... - Mm. Little, uh... How much do I owe you? Ah. Grazie. Morning, Castor. Would you like a bombolone? A bombolone? Unless you want me to take the whole box, ooh, because I could eat my weight in bombolone. Thank you. Thank you, and good luck today. Good morning, Dad. Hm. Let's get cooking. Bombolone. No. Thank you, Maya. Thank you, Maya. Dude, you got to respect the blade. Perfect. Mm, Lorenzo makes the best bombolone in the city. You can tell who made it just by looking at it? - Mm, mm. - He signed his boxes. - Smart. - Hm. Who brought someone else's food into my kitchen? I did, and I brought one for you too. All right, listen up. The hotel's Christmas week celebrations begin tonight with the tree lighting and a cocktail party for the guests. Michel will get us a count of how many guests this morning, Tommaso, you're in charge of the charcuterie board, and it's hard to mess up a charcuterie board, but I'm sure you'll find a way. We'll be serving dinner immediately afterwards, so it doesn't have to be elaborate, okay? We don't wanna spoil anyone's appetite. Yes, chef. We'll also need a cold mixed seafood platter with three sauces. Along with that is a chilled sour cherry soup. We'll be serving those in the small ramekin, Guillermo. Let me know how many you need. Maya. Yes, Chef? Onion gallette, mushroom croquets, and fricase. Don't use too much oil. Your fricase were dripping with it last time. Don't forget, tomorrow night, midnight supper for the party. Is it somewhere more important that you'd like to be - tomorrow night? - No. No, Chef. - No, Chef. - No, didn't think so. Okay. On the menu we've got focaccia, rump butter and grilled prawns, fettuccine with fennel and lamb sausage, and agnolotti with walnut sauce and the grilled leg of lamb. For dessert, the vanilla gelato with olive oil, honey and fennel pollen. - Contestant. - Yes, Chef. I read your proposed menu for the light supper. You may prepare that for the staff meal today. Thanks, Chef. Let's go. Chef was really hard on you today. He's stressed about that Diamond Fork thing. It's a big deal. And he is human, even if it doesn't seem like it. Salads, where are the salads? Come on, it's noon. Tommaso, wake up. Faster, quicker, let's go. - Yes, Chef. - More speed. No, no, no. Move, move, move. You have to take your time, okay? It has to be slower and thicker, like this. This is what you want, this, okay? It's a carrot. Hold on, hold on. What is that blob? Sorry, Chef, I was just going to... No, it's okay, it's okay. Would you serve this? - You were going to serve this? - Yes. Do it again! Bloody running this restaurant on my own sometimes. Mm, this is delicious. There's coriander in this? Interesting choice. Take the lemon down a notch. It's overwhelming the other flavors. Yes, Chef. And a French style potato salad. Well, the meal was competently prepared, it's just boring. Who can tell me one of the many things she did wrong? Your tenderloins were too plain. They needed a sauce. Yes, a sauce. And you have a sauce with your name on it. That sauce is my father's secret recipe. He says he'll give it to me on his death bed. If he drops dead suddenly, does that mean the secret will be lost forever? My nonna, she died before revealing her cacio e pepe sauce. My grandfather made the best cheese. Was your grandfather from Parma? So it was probably very good cheese, but it wasn't the best cheese. You served me little slabs of meat marinating in their own fat with a little garlic and rosemary. Do you think this restaurant earned its reputation by serving pork with garlic and rosemary? No, Chef, I don't. Anyone can do that in their own kitchen. You have no business in my kitchen. We train professionals here, not glorified fry cooks, not amateurs who win a contest to play at being a chef. I am not playing. Well, I thought the flavors were very fresh in your potato salad, right? It was a good balance between crunch and creamy. Thank you. What contest was Chef talking about? Oh, Cash for Cuisine. It was a contest put on by a local TV station to showcase local cooks. Yeah, the first prize winner won $25,000 and a chance to train under a master chef. 25,000, you won't go very far these days. Yeah, well, I have a plan. So I bought a food truck at a sheriff's impound sale. I'm gonna fit it out and I'm going to use it to build up clientèle and get name recognition, and then transition into a little sit-down small place. Serving what? European fusion food? No, I'm just here to learn technique. But I really wanna cook the food that I grew up with, just with a modern twist. So crab bisque, shrimp and grits, quartz of gumbo, low country boil. So good. What are you going to call it? No, Low Country Love. But I need backers, so I need to train under Chef Penn Childers, and the way that it's going, feels like he's gonna fire me at any moment. Hmm, he's just stressed about the Diamond Fork dinner. Is it really that big of a deal? The biggest. Twenty years ago, the Florilege has been awarded the very first one that AGG gave out. AGG? The Association of Global Gourmets. No restaurant has ever won the Diamond Fork twice. Chef aims to change that. Hm. Right, break over, you two. Kitchen isn't going to run itself. So have you decided what you're gonna make for the Diamond Fork? Perhaps you should concern yourself with your own cooking. Hello? Yes. Yes. Ah, for God's sake, please. No, not this time. Really? Right, okay. Please, I... It just can't happen. Fine, fine, fine. Yes, yes. Okay, yep. Bye. Is everything okay? My parents. It's... Are they okay? They've decided to spend Christmas at the Florilege, and they're bringing the Snake. Your parents have a pet snake? That's just what I call her. Ashleigh Symington Price. Her initial spell ASP, hence the name. She's the woman my parents want me to marry. They've been talking about our amazing wedding since I was six. I'm doomed. You're looking at a doomed man. And you have no say in it? Think. Come on, come on, Penn. What if, what if ASP's too late? What if, what if I'm already involved with someone? - You! - What? You're not seeing anyone right now, are you? No. Me? No. I'm not getting in the middle of this. Then you are perfect for it. You are confident and smart without making people feel dumb. You are kind and thoughtful. You're beautiful. You're everything a man could want. Except for your parents wants you to marry the Snake. So no. There is no way. Your parents wouldn't even buy it anyway. I mean, they don't even know me, and you just show up engaged? Well, my parents don't, they're not really involved in my life. They're not involved, yet they're making romantic decisions for you? What I mean is, they wouldn't necessarily expect me to share the news of my good fortune with them. Don't you know anyone else? What about Edda? Really? Listen, if my parents are skeptical, I'll just say, you had me at souffle. Maya, wait, wait, listen. Look, you are gonna make this really bad for the both of us. You need my endorsement to get the rest of the money to open a restaurant. - What? - I heard you talking to Edda. I can make it happen. - Just do this. - Wait, so you're gonna blackmail me? No, no, no, no. This is just business arrangement. How do you think this business arrangement's supposed to work? I don't know. Jesus Christ. What's all the questions? What do you want, a contract? Okay, and there wouldn't be any... Oh, not at all. No, no, no. Believe me, I wouldn't even think about doing that with you. Because we, uh, work together. That's what I'm trying to say. I told you there were something between them. Ugh, they hate each other. ♪ I hurt you 'Cause I love you ♪ Shut up. Shh, they're gonna hear. Listen, the Florilege is my life. Everyone needs to understand what a privilege it is to cook in a kitchen with so much history. I won't lose this kitchen, whatever it takes. Okay, these are the rules. No touching, no hugging, no kissing, and you have to stop yelling at me. Well, I don't yell at you any more than I yell at anyone else. You shouldn't be yelling at anyone. Why not? - She's pregnant. - Shut up. - Nah, this is about the potato salad. - Hmm. He finds out she's a spy undercover, but a group of terrorists is keeping her sister hostage. Now they're coming here to kill us all. And after the engagement, or after we announced that, and then... then what? Just make me the villain. Tell everyone I dumped you. Everyone will think I'm a jerk. I'm used to that. After I tell everyone that you dumped me, my father's gonna wanna have a conversation with you. But you'll have your certificate. Every restaurant in the world will welcome you with a red carpet. And we won't have to see each other ever again. No touching, no hugging, no kissing... and no yelling. Agh. I look forward to it. They will keep the baby. The potato salad will be sweeter. She will pay to keep her cover, but we saw too much and we will die anyway. I feel like I'm gonna regret this. She's coming back. - Is everything okay? - Yes. Is your sister okay? What? I don't have a sister. Wait a minute. What's going on here? I'll tell you what's happening. We're 15 minutes late for dinner, so let's just cut the crap. Let's just get back to work, shall we? Got a lot to do. Hey, Maya, they treating you all right over there? Hey, Charlene. You look busy. What's that? Hey, I'll just call you tomorrow. Love you. Love you. How do you know where I live? I have something for you. My parents won't buy the charade unless I put a ring on it. Put a ring on it? Seriously? I knew this was a bad idea. I don't really wear much jewelry. Wow. This is really beautiful. - Mm-hmm. - Whose was it? My grandmother's. It was in my grandfather's family for generations, then he gave it to her. Won't this make her more crazy? - Who? - The Snake, ASP. Well, it will only make her go green and a little smoke and steam will come out of her nose and ears, that's all. What do you think? You speak Italian well. Well, I'm a chef in an Italian restaurant. So you like feeding people? Yeah, it's actually one of the first things my father taught me. A lot of problems are caused by people who are hungry. Feed them. - He's a wise man. - Mm. Or a glorified fry cook? To be totally honest, I actually have never eaten the barbecue before. Ah, you poor, deprived child. My father would never approve me marrying you. Why not? I think I'm actually catch. Okay. Well, my father is actually the undisputed barbecue king of Charleston, South Carolina. He has four franchises in the States and one in Canada. So me being here is bad enough. He has a franchise in Canada? Yeah, people in Canada go crazy for his cue. Crazy For his cue? Oh, yeah. It's a motto. It's, has it on, like, t-shirts and jockey shorts. Now that sounds saucy. Don't even, okay? I've heard every possible pun and bad barbecue joke ever. All right, how's this one? Why did the skeleton go to the barbecue? To get spare ribs? Darn it. Um, okay. What do you call a barbecue pun? A meat-aphor. A meat-aphor. Okay, stop, okay? Or I'm gonna have to hurt you. Really. Yeah. - Castor. - Chef. Bonjour, Michel. Bonjour. These new decorations are lovely. Oh, thank you. I understand congratulations are in order. Oh, yes. Thank you. Thank you. You should know that the new owners of the hotel plan to convert the Florilege on a day spa. - Oh. - Mm. You're late. Shouldn't have been wasting time gossiping with Michel. Perfect. Perfect, guys. Well done. Hello? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Maya, stop what you're doing. Start a batch of banana bottom-up ice cream. - Yes, Chef. - And you, prep the courgettes. La Contessa requested moussaka. La Contessa is here? She'll be arriving later, just in time for lunch. I have something for you to try when you're on your break. What is it? A banana buttermilk croissant with a ribbon of caramel woven through it. Mm, sounds delicious. It is. I invented it. I'd appreciate your critique. Oh, Merry Christmas, Castor. Well, you're looking lovely. Well, you look as beautiful as always. - Oh. - Welcome back. Oh, well, thank you, and it's so good to see you too. Merry Christmas. Isn't she gonna check in? We keep the Golden Suite reserved for her at all times. How long does she usually stay? Until she's ready to go. ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go ♪ ♪ Laughing all the way ♪ ♪ Bells on bobtail ring ♪ ♪ Making spirits bright ♪ ♪ What fun it is To ride and sing ♪ ♪ A sleighing song tonight Oh ♪ Guillermo? You're on prep tonight. Get your cousin on the phone to wash the dishes. Yes, Chef. Um, we'll be back in time to prepare for the midnight supper, but I have a meeting to check if everything's ready for the Christmas dinner. Maya, you'll take notes. Um, Edda, it's your lucky night tonight. - You're in charge for dinner. - Whatever you need, Chef. Maya. We are going to die. Relax. I think your kitchen will survive one meal without you. What if AGG sends a secret reviewer a couple of days early, huh? That would be cheating, wouldn't it? Well, the restaurant business is pretty cutthroat, and that Chef is lobbying pretty hard to win the Diamond Fork, so. Michel said something weird today. Don't listen to a thing Michel says. But everyone talks to him. Come. No touching, remember? Drive you home. Right, I'll wait here for you. Okay. We have to be back at the Florilege for eight. Got it. Okay, so tell me what I need to know. They'll try and twist you. Reply question will hide a knife. My parents, well, they're a lot. And what about the Snake? Will she be there? You bet. Listen, it's just a couple of drinks. Keep smiling and it'll all be done. Drunk and dumb woman. I'm their first target. They'll try and destroy me through you. Don't get caught up in it. Yay. So I threw him a life ring. He climbed back on board, still clutching the champagne bottle. A very fine vintage though, so. Penn Dragon, I've missed you. Hi. Maya, this is my old friend, Ashleigh. Ashleigh, this is Maya, my fiancée. Well, um, come on in. Gwendolyn and Jon are expecting you, and won't you be a nice surprise for them? Hmm. So you met in the kitchen of the very restaurant that sent up incredible food last night. That's adorable. Remember that time you brought me cherries Jubilee in bed? - Ashleigh. - Oh, my, it was just too funny. He was being so sincere, and then he set the sheets on fire and the smoke alarm went off. And now he's a world-class chef. Your little ring is so pretty. A nice statement in semi-precious stones and a wonderful way to say that engagement rings don't have to be conflict diamonds from Africa. That was my grandmother's ring. It was meant for someone special. I always thought he'd give it to you. I did give it to someone special. Will you be staying here for the holidays? Yes, we'll be working. - Oh. - Hmm. That's a shame. Not even a break to go skiing? Oh, Penn is hopeless on the slopes. You should have seen him the first time Gwendolyn and Jon took him skiing in Gstaad. - Yes, well, in my defense, I was six. - He cried. And I knew I was missing out on the hot chocolate back at the lodge. Come in. No, thank you. Me either. - Anyone? - Thank you. Excuse me. Hello? Yes. What about your family? Won't they miss you? It's just my father and I. Oh, it's so sad how many marriages end up in divorce these days, especially in America. One in two, isn't it? My mother died of breast cancer. Yes. Yes. Just start serving. It's taking longer than it expected. Don't screw up. He's not coming. He's not coming. He would never leave the kitchen. Not to us. Not to you. What do you mean? That I'm not good, yeah? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop it. You look like mountain goats. Let's stop the situation. I've been working in this kitchen for seven years. Chef has never, never left. That must be a life or death thing. Seven years and still dishwasher? Bravo. And Maya is gone, like rats running from a sinking ship, or a life or death thing. But who's dead? Hey, there's something blocking the door. What's going on? What are you guys doing here? Chef is gone. Maya disappeared. She abandoned the ship. Well actually no, they're in the Red Suite having the sort of a meeting with Penn's parents, I think. Oh, she's pregnant. Whatever. Um, where's the midnight meal? Let's do it. For what it counts, haven't you guys heard? They're selling the Florilege. They wanna turn it into a spa, so bye-bye, fancy kitchen. I told you they were terrible. It's okay. I think I'll walk. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. She's not buying it. Good night, love birds. Please. Did the midnight supper go out? Tommaso overcooked the pasta. He's the pasta master. I'm sure the guests had seconds. It's not the point. Good enough, it's just, it's not good enough. People just wanna eat food that tastes good and is made with love. Oh, you're so naive. Sorry, it's just, it's dog eat dog out there, and every bite counts. We can't have any mushy pasta on the night AGG evaluates us for the Diamond Fork. I mean, what if they sent someone tonight? So we're done. Okay, let's go. And, Maya? Thank you. Hey, Dad. Hey, baby girl. How you doing? I miss you. Hey, didn't you go to high school with Dwayne Harrison? Football player with small hands? Yeah. I think he was a year ahead of me. He became a firefighter, right? That's right. I'm catering his wedding next month. He's marrying some emergency room doctor that he met on the late shift. You seeing anybody? Um... No. I'm, I'm too busy. They're giving you any time off this Christmas? No, it's actually one of the busiest times of year, so. Well, that's the restaurant business. But I think that fancy chef is working you too hard. You already a great cook. You don't need to know how to make gold plated foie gras. Besides, I got a franchise with your name on it, and you can write a blog on the side. There are already too many food blogs. But there's only one Maya Coleman. If you wanna come home for Christmas, I'll send you a ticket. I'll be home in a couple of months. You better be. You should be out having fun. But not too much fun. I miss you, Daddy. You haven't called me "Daddy" in a long time. Okay, well, I gotta go. All right. You have a good one. ♪ Deck the halls With boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ Don we now, our gay apparel ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ Toll the ancient Yuletide carol ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ See the blazing yule Before us ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ Strike the harp And join the chorus ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ Follow me in merry measure ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ While I tell of Yuletide treasure ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la la ♪ ♪ Heedless Of the wind and weather ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la ♪ Um, we're getting low on whole wheat flour. Yeah. Do we have enough crystal ginger for the panettone? Uh, yes. Um, Michel says there are new investors and they're thinking about replacing the restaurant with spies, is that true? The Florilege has been an institution for years. Any investor knows that. One way to lose money is to turn it into something else. If you win the Diamond Fork- When I win the Diamond Fork. This place is the only good thing about my childhood. My parents used to make a show of bringing the family to the Florilege every summer, but really they just handed me off to my grandparents while they were, so they could be childless and carefree. It was, it was my grandparents who taught me how to cook. How to smell and to taste. They made this place a treasure, and... and we need more green lentils. Carry on. I'll go and pick up the order. Good morning, everyone. Does everyone in your kitchen speak English? - Yes. - Yes. Then I won't have to be bothered to have anyone translate my message. I'm here on behalf of the new owners, Hawthenthorpe Hospitality Group. You've no doubt heard the rumors, how people do like to gossip, that we are considering re-purposing this space into a spa. Well, the rumors are true. Over the next few days, we'll be evaluating this restaurant as a profit center. Stress testing, if you might say, to see if it might still be viable. So just go about your business as I'm not here. Hm? Where's Penn Dragon? He's at the train station picking up a delivery. Oh, that sounds like something your dishwasher could do. His name is Guillermo, and he's busy. You know, in Japan, they're already using robotic dishwashers. The company's very interested in how robotics can transform the hospitality industry. We've identified several possible pilot projects in North America. The fast food restaurants are already using robotic cooks. We imagine it can transform the barbecue sector as well. No one's gonna buy barbecue from a robot. Really? Even if it lowers the prices and increases the profit margin? You wouldn't dare. We're looking closely to the South Carolina market. Yes, Chef, coming right now. Guillermo, Chef is at the back with the supplies. What happened? Someone die or something? A representative from Hawthenthorpe Hospitality Group just paid us a visit. Oh. Your parents bought the hotel. My family are negotiating to acquire the property, yes. And you didn't think to tell your fiancée that? They haven't signed the paperwork yet. Well, does Ashleigh know that? Because she was in here throwing around her weight as if it was already a done deal, and she threatened to come after my father's restaurant, too. - What? Really? - Yes. Listen, she's just giving you a hard time. Hawthenthorpe Hospitality, they don't take on small businesses. Small? I just meant purely regional. Huh, you are such a snob. And you knew that from the beginning. We had a deal and we are done. So if you want to leave, I will sign your certificate, right here, right now. I have a restaurant to manage, and tomorrow, everyone will know it's the best in the world, so if you want to go, go now. But before you do that, ask yourself why you are here. What do you want exactly? What do you need exactly? Life is tough. It can beat you and take you down. Take everything you are, everything you love. Do you wanna know why I'm here? Why we are all here? Because we believe in this place, your dream. I left everything for this, for you. And you wanna know why I agreed to our stupid deal in the first place? Because I felt sorry for you. You're a grown man who can't tell his parents that you wanna live your own life. And this whole masquerade... is just... If you don't wanna marry Ashleigh, then just tell your parents. What more can they do to you? They're already planning on demolishing your grandparents' restaurant. Ugh. Right, clean up, go home. Tomorrow's a big day. Possibly the biggest, but you're free. So, ah, if you still think it's your chance, then be here at 7:00 AM. If not, it's been an honor to work with you all. Careful with that ring. It might get lost. And what are you getting Penn for Christmas? Hmm? I don't know yet. Hmm, you know what I bet he would love? His grandmother used to make him this very famous Italian cake. It's called Dolce di Amalfi. It's lemons and almonds. It was his favorite sweet as a child. Oh, thank you. Oh, dear, Miss Maya, you're missing the cocktails. I told you. Ah, do you mind? I would like to have a little chat with Penn's fiancée alone. - Certainly. - Thank you. - I'll see you later. - Oh, boy. That woman, she sure makes my skin crawl. Penn told me that you've got engaged. Oh, it's so pretty. Oh, I love it. I have never been a fan of those big bubbles that double as a brass knuckles. So, I mean, these are just presents from friends. So I am so happy for you. Penn is such, he is such a sweet boy. He kind of lost his way a little bit when his grandparents passed away, but you seem like you'll be really, really good for him. And he is a catch. He's handsome and kind, rich. I'm not a gold digger. Oh, no. I never thought you were, not at all. Unlike some of the other people around here. If you'll excuse me, I have to go. Tomorrow's a really big day for a Chef, ah, Penn, and I don't wanna disappoint him. Ah. The flowers, one red, one white. If I see a petal in the wrong way, I'm gonna hurt you. If I see it on the ground, I'm gonna kill you. Table toppers need to be ironed. The guests will start coming soon. Get ready, come on! - Is it true? - What? That if we're not getting the Diamond Fork, they will turn this place into a spa? Thank you. Today is our last chance to make history. We've got work to do. Let's go. I'll be back in a moment. You all right? Chef? Chef? Call an ambulance! Chef? Call an ambulance! You all right? Penn just left the hotel in an ambulance. - What happened? - What? Is that almonds? Who did that? You told me that was his favorite cake. I never would've told you that. He's allergic to almonds. I was the one dealing with his allergy growing up. Penn knew this was a hopeless task from the beginning. He knew his parents had no interest in keeping this restaurant going. I'm sure the company will help you find jobs elsewhere. You don't want pastries today? What's wrong? Everything. You came to Italy to be a cook, yes? Yes. And do you believe that food is everything? Everything, and more. Do you know the story of how the pizza was invented? No. It was invented to please the queen. The baker took the dough, covered it with the tomato sauce, Mozzarella cheese and basil. Red, white, and green. The colors of the Italian flag. The pizza was called a Margherita pizza, like the queen. No one really remember that queen, but the pizza, everybody knows the Margherita pizza, even in America. - So... - So it's all about the food. Everything is about food. Be the pizza, not the queen. Grazie, Lorenzo. Merry Christmas, Maya. Merry Christmas. Maya, I heard Penn is in the hospital? Yes. So you're canceling tonight's event? I mean, I've had Mrs. Childers on the phone all afternoon. Gwendolyn? What, she wants to cancel tonight's dinner? No, not a chance. Hey, anyone asks, the dinner is on tonight, and we will win the Diamond Fork. Now, excuse me. I have some cooking to do. Who's got Penn's menu? I do, but delivery couldn't get us all the ingredients we needed. We don't have much wheat for all the bread baskets. That's okay, we'll make buttermilk cornmeal biscuits. I've never had those. They're delicious. And we don't have the suckling pigs. Ah, that's okay. How many guests are booked for tonight? Just the one seating, so 50. I think I know where we can find some pork. Great. If you can give me 30 kilos of pork, we can do that. Yes. We used the last of the potatoes on yesterday dishes was. How are we on rice? - We are good. - Damn right, we're good. Hey, guys, listen, this might be Penn's dream, but I think it might be ours, too. Be the pizza, not the queen. - Yes! - Yes! Maya. Yes. A BBQ, what is that? What? Of course not. This is the Florilege. A what? Fire pit? Excuse me. Hmm. I'll be glad when she's gone. Why? Well, she tips awfully low for someone who's getting their room comped. Well, maybe she's waiting to leave a big tip 'til the very end. Oh, and she's such a pig. - She is? - Yeah. Housekeeper tells me that the bed sheets are disgusting. Well then, I imagine she'll be leaving very soon then. - Hopefully. - Hopefully. Is there anything else you need? No. Thank you so much, Castor. What? No, it's impossible, no. I-I-is everything okay? - Oh, my God. - What's wrong? - Oh, my God. - What's wrong? There's been an accident in the kitchen. Oh. Penn is at the hospital now with an allergic reaction. Oh, dear. The doctors want to keep him overnight. Oh, wow. Does that mean you're canceling the dinner? That's the point. This Maya, the American, she's trying to, she's asking to... Oh, well, oh, that must be the American. Ah, Contessa. Oh, Miss Maya. Michel just told me about the accident with Penn. I know. I am so sorry. But someone tricked me about Chef, Penn's, allergies. I know I should be with him at the hospital right now, 'cause I'm his fiancée, but I just... Well, you are doing the right thing. And let me tell you something. It has been a long time since someone has done the right thing for Penn. What are you making? We're preparing hush puppies. Oh, I love hush puppies. Oh, the best hush puppies I ever had were in South Carolina. I stopped at the best little barbecue joint on my way to Florida, going to a beauty pageant, of course, and I still have the t-shirt that I bought from there that says "Crazy for the Cue." Oh, and the best looking man in Charleston was behind the counter. I would've of course stayed for breakfast, but he was a single dad, and I knew that the only female that he had time for in his life was his beautiful, beautiful daughter. But best hush puppies ever. Maya, what'd you wanna do with all this pork? Oh, uh, fire now. Now. I know you're awake. No, I'm just having a bad dream. What you want, Dad? What I've always wanted. What's that? World peace? A solution to global warming? Grow up. You're a Childers. That name means something. My name means something because I made it mean something. Hmm, working as a chef in that scruffy little restaurant that should have closed before the century turned? That restaurant was a labor of love. And it showed in every plate of food Nonna ever served. That was then. This is now. You're going to turn it into a spa. That was as Ashleigh's idea. That girl's got a good head on her shoulders. - Why won't you marry her? - I don't love her. What's love got to do with it? This is business. Are you really going to make the worst mistake of your mistake-ridden life? Do you know what? The worst mistake I made in life was letting you tell me how to live it. You're going to buy the Florilege and destroy it just to punish me for not being a good little corporate drone. You are such a disappointment. The Florilege is a national treasure, and this restaurant is the best in the world. Hmm, when you're in the Diamond Fork. Hmm. Yeah, awards are nice, but you can't eat them. I'm leasing the restaurant, but I'll buy it one day. Not with my money. Pff, no. No, no, no, no. Not with your money. With what I'm earning from every plate of food I serve... from every single human that can appreciate the labor of love. So you think every problem in the world can be solved by feeding people? Yeah, it's a start. Well played. I learned from a master. People just want to eat food that tastes good and is made with love. Oh, you're so naive. Sorry I'm late. You just missed a miserable appetizer. The service here has really gone downhill. Well, what are you comparing it to? This has really gone downhill. Hmm? Wine comes out... Got the sauce? For that, we will need an expert. Please, please, please answer. Maya, what's going on? Is everything okay? Dad, I don't have time to explain, but please, I need your help right now. What's going on, baby? I need the recipe for the secret sauce. Whoa, whoa, baby. That's our family secret. I know. And I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important, but this is family business. I love you. Dad, please. You will keep the secret. Promise. Merry Christmas, baby. You need pepper and grains. Honey, raw if you have it. Honey. Brew coffee, a cup for every 12 servings. Coffee! Brew coffee, STAT! - Coffee! - Coffee! It's actually one of the first things my father taught me. A lot of problems are caused by people who are hungry. Feed them. Now, we need the most severe judge ever. Edda? Please. Okay, calm down. Calm down. All right. It's not over yet. Maya, check the quantities. Guillermo, Guillermo, go get the waiters. We need plates! Woo! So, what was the reaction? Do you think they like it? Um, they kept asking for more and the comments were nice, and the tips were astronomical. Okay. And when the results will be announced? Their table is empty now, and they're probably still discussing, but I guess it's not gonna take long. They don't wanna lose their audience. If you'll excuse me. There you are. Come on, we don't have much time. Ah, I have to go change my clothes. Exactly. Come with me. Oh, Miss Mariana, I can't. I really appreciate it, but... Oh, no, no, no, no. Just think of it as an engagement gift. Ah, I'm not really engaged. I know. Penn told me. But you know what? I have known him for a really long time and I've never seen him look at anyone the way he looks at you, and I think that you might like him too. Sometimes. Well, good. Then my job is done here. Just a final touch. Come on. Let's go win that Diamond Fork. Oh, that was delicious. It was so good. Oh, here we go. Twenty-three years ago, the AGG awarded the first Diamond Fork Award for Excellence to the Florilege and its owner, Ana and Andrea Childers. What's wrong? I... Um, I'm sorry. What did you do? Shh. They're about to give out the award. Let's be quiet. Tonight, it's our pleasure to present the Diamond Fork Award. It is with an unanimous vote that we are presenting the award to the Florilege Hotel and Resort. We call the chef and the staff from the Florilege kitchen to receive the award. Chef, go get your award. But I don't... No, it was, it was you. It was you. Go. We did it! Yes! Tommaso, I'm so proud of you. Chef, no, it wasn't me. Maya did it. Oh, well, can I, can I talk to her? She's gone. What? Yeah, she said it was time for her to go. Well, where did she go? I guess she went to the train station. - I'll call you back. - All right. We are closed. We have no bombolone now. No, I don't want any bombolone. I came here to tell you that we won the Diamond Fork. I know. Oh. Well, I'm done here. So guess this is goodbye. Merry Christmas, Chef. What are you doing? What are you doing here? Maya! Maya, wait! Wait, please. Maya, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I was a jerk. Yeah. Well, it's almost midnight, and it's time for Cinderella to go home. But that's not how the story ends. Before I met you, all I had was food. I thought that was enough. And, and you've taught me so much, and I couldn't have done it without you. I have fallen completely in love with you. I've gone mad. I can't get you out of my head. I can't stop thinking about you. I'm not very good at this, but you have... one of the most beautiful smiles I've ever seen. When you walk into a room, you light the place up. And when you look at me, I go all weak, and I feel all gooey inside. And you have... the most purest, kindest souls I've ever known. No matter how much I yelled, no matter, I, I could have shouted at you, you stuck around and you helped me. What I'm trying to say is, I can't live my life without you in it. I've spent my whole life trying to figure out who I want to be, but I won't take as long to figure out who I want to be with. No touching. No hugging.
