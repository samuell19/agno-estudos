He is Pedda Panjani, financier for our project - Who, this fellow? He doesn’t look like that, right? - Yes Poor fellow became so by investing money on me He is Aragonda, my assistant and gemologist - Hi gemmologist Few years back, while we were researching in Parasurama Kshetram temple, we found this locker I knew for sure that either a treasure or information about treasure would be there in this But, I could open it just in five minutes with the idea you gave We got this treasure map just because of you We’d find even the treasure only with you Will you join us in this operation to find the treasure? So, if treasure should we go on horses like in cowboy films?

Huh, no idea which God should come down to change her This Parasuram Kshetram was ruled from 1310 to 1520 BC by Cholas, Rashtrakootas and Pandya Kings The last generation to safeguard their wealth from the enemies, built this temple and hid as a treasure in here There is no God in this temple Yaswant Bahadur Veera Rayalau, the last ruler died in war without informing about this treasure to his heir That treasure lies somewhere right in this temple As per this map we found, we shall search and own it somehow Take every word of mine seriously. The path you’d go lies in between life and death People from this village won’t step into the temple They don’t allow the outsiders even near the temple They believe one who steps into the temple would never come out again In such a state, for them to let you in everyone there should get a confidence on you Public witness devil in fear and God when in trance Even the get up you change now should be a similar one This is that powerful Parasurama Kshetram of Pulinadu in Punganuru Can we show our powers? - Yes How? While you walk, handicapped in the fourth minute, pregnant lady in eighth minute and old man comes in the 12th minute Will all act well? - They would live in roles Perfect? - Always Why is some disturbance happening in my stomach?

Stop it, rascal Hey, how are you talking? How are you talking, man? What just talking, this hand is going to earn Crores -Crores? The same lines, the same hand Hey, you are that lucky man - To hell with you and the luck, get out Hey, I and you picked the same purse at wine shop one day. Do you remember? I saw the golden line in your hands that day Hey, all will have lines in hands Hey, see this hand. Is there any line being seen? You’d have given big work for the hand - You fool Look, you, I and all of us came into this temple for the treasure I’m into the bad luck and never get anything. I need a guy like you by my side You have the luck and I have the route. Success comes only with the combination Mix up all and go ahead, don’t do any mistakes. Think carefully You’d never get such a chance again and again You are DD Baba, right? - Yes Our Govind explained all about the treasure information with you All our doubts are clarified with that. I’m preparing the exact route map to get the treasure All of you go into the temple and do a complete inspection Know about every inch and our Panjani will invest the amount needed I will invest, major share once we get the treasure is mine, right? What about shares? - Hey, I’ll decide about shares and parts I’m saying right now, I’m the main person for this project Oh, then get it done by them and I’m leaving Panjani, what is this? - Where are you going, man? Who’d do it now? I’m investing money here You rascal, why are you putting hands on me? You think me as a labor? I’ll break your face. Bro, I won’t be at a place with no respect I’m saying even to you, I lived in respect and have a goal in life It’s over and completely ruined now. Ready, I too will see who invests now. Come on Investing isn’t to loot the pockets, come on If you invest, should we be like dogs at your feet? Won’t we have some respect? Should we bear his insults? - Hey, ok Bro - I’m leaving - Hey, Govindu I will never work with dogs like you Govind Sir! Mr. Govind! You all have great anger Hey, I just joked man. Come on Ok, move on Oh no, you look great when angry. Come on - Damn you, go Govindu! Where is he? Finally, let’s loot the treasure in this God less temple and share it Deal done. Who is it? Are you all thieves - Hey beauty, when did you come? Your dress is great You cheat me, my dad and my villagers with your fake talks? Was I with a cheat for so long? - Don’t misunderstand in your anger please Not so, Govind is a very good man Was that required? Thippu beauty, you don’t get angry dear - You don’t talk I believed you a lot - What all you see isn’t true What have people said about you? Are they all true? No, right? There’s a good girl inside you, right? Similarly there’s a loyalty and truth behind this getup of mine What exactly was the reason for you to be in this getup? If the requirement is small we take troubles and debts if that is big And if it’s further big, we do such mistakes for good What’s good in thieves? - Not the job done but should see the intention behind that I’m from Somala village. It is 80 Kilometers away from here We all love our village a lot. We love so much that can’t leave it even when one by one was dying for unknown reasons Like the Florosis problem in Nalgonda and Kidney problem in Uddhanam, our Somala had Cancer problem We don’t know whether it was in our ground or air, but it finished many of us I said we shall donate from each house, when Fakir recently died. Did any of you listen to me? This isn’t a play done by you to donate, uncle - Wait man If Cholera or Typhoid, it is done in few thousands. This is cancer It costs a minimum of 10 to 15 Lacks per each patient. Where do we get that? What if we sell away our lands? Huh, your land isn’t near Amaravathi or Polavaram to get crores by selling We may show greed and sell even the forest, but we get peanuts by selling our land You’d be on roads by selling the lands in hand There is no other way now, we have to leave the village to be alive You are a young man and can live going anywhere. What will you do with your old parents? Look Sankaraiah, how long would you still circle around that MRO? We need some help to keep her alive, right? Doctors said she’d live for just two more years My hope is, she’d live at least a day more by giving that treatment I suffered a lot thinking to save lives of my villagers dying with cancer To get all those treated, it would cost at least 10 Crores I didn’t know how and from where to get that money I then understood how heavy it feels after taking up a responsibility At the same time, my childhood friend Prasanna Laxmi came to meet me While talking she informed me to be contesting as MLA and she needs her support in elections At once, a new thought and courage were born in me I immediately said about the cancer problem in our village and about the money required for treatment She gave me a word to take care that no life will be gone from then with cancer I too gave her word that all votes from my village will be given to her My dear Somala villagers, we believed so many people from so long They haven’t done anything till date Let’s believe good hearted girl from our own village To drive away the demon of cancer from our Somala village, we shall give our vote only to Nalluri Prasanna Laxmi Our vote - To plough symbol Listen carefully to what I’m saying The ink dot you get on your finger while voting to Prasanna Laxmi would show a direction to us Stop it, man. Enough that elections are on, they say to show development but nothing is done After winning in elections, you neither cure our disease nor save from cancer deaths Go away, man Look Malik grandpa, if you’d got this thought 30 years back none would’ve died here with cancer We finally have got a chance. Let’s save at least the 15 left behind Believe and you should believe grandpa - One minute Govindu Is it enough to save those 15 members? Is it enough for you that I save those 15 members? I can get treatment arrange right away as his friend for those 15 cancer patients But for none from our village to suffer with cancer going ahead, multi specialty hospital should be built The first work I’d do once I’m elected as MLA is to construct a cancer hospital in our village I thinking just to save the 15 members, felt it great that she took up the responsibility to save our entire village Madam, all of us together are giving five acres of land for the cancer hospital you are going to construct Here are the papers regarding the same, madam Oh no, why all this? - You please take them Many thanks - Kittu Kittu! What happened Kittu? - Kittu What happened Subba? - No idea what’s wrong, Govindu He is down vomiting blood - Hey, start the tractor immediately Tractor may get late. Driver, start our vehicle Son… - Move aside Move aside, fast Dilip, take him to our hospital in Tirupati Hey, all of you go - Go on, go Come on guys, make it fast Hello uncle, I’m Prasanna - Say baby There’s been a problem for a kid in our family - What’s wrong, dear? I’m sending him to our hospital. He’s my boy. No problem about the expenses The kid should come back in smiles. Please uncle, please Seeing her worry to save a kid’s life, who had no connection with her, she seemed like a Goddess coming for our village at that time Right then, I got full confidence about her victory Our entire village stood one, gave her the entire votes and made our Prasanna Lakshmi win with a huge majority Yes! What phones at this time bro, cut it. (Chants) What would’ve been the reason? - Damn! I’m not getting the line. No idea why she got late. I’ll go and bring her with me You be right here, uncle - Ok Laxmi! Laxmi! Hey, come Govindu Laxmi, why are you sitting here? Entire village is waiting there for you Come, let’s go - Where, what’s this hurry? Sit Govindu! I haven’t come to sit. You shall do foundation there for cancer hospital. Come on, let’s go We shall do, why so hurry? What’s this Laxmi? That was what you said to do as first think after you become MLA, right? Then, why are you talking like this now? Hey Govindu, that was election campaigning. We shall delete all promises made there We shouldn’t store them here. How could you talk like this, Prasanna? You looked like colorful VIGBYOR for what you said then But you seem like a color changing chameleon now Hey, mad idiot! Time itself changes thrice in one year and what are we? There are so many promises and let’s see Silence! 40 crores were spent then to make my father win And I had to spend about 35, of course I saved 5 Crores because of you Let me first collect all that money After that, not just one but will get 100 cancer hospitals built Not so Prasanna, you said not to let even one life end due to cancer 15 people are ready there to die. All of them voted for you, I promise Isn’t the responsibility of people who made you win yours? Public! What public? They are just votes. After the election fever is down, we have no work with the tablets named voters Still, what’s the guarantee that they all voted to me? Guarantee! You need a guarantee? You know about every booth polling in my village Even those migrating to other places for livelihood came down too and voted for you Handicapped, old, young, poor and all have voted for you What did you say DO our votes look like tablets and biscuits for you? They are our blood droplets. Forget all that, the majority of 5640 votes are from our village Those are the donation from us to you What did you say? I won because of votes from your villagers, otherwise I’d have lost Is it so? - Reality is that and don’t take this easy Saying all that you’d get hospital in our village and save lives, I made all believe, agree and then made them vote for you So, I won because of you and your campaigning You are really a hero Govindu. What’s the problem now, you construct that cancer hospital too Go! - Where to go, rascal? I’d drag you from here and make you lay the foundation stone Hey, stop - Hey Hey, stop - Hey, leave me guys Get out You’re doing a mistake, Lakshmi. Listen to me, this isn’t good Leave me, idiots. Leave me, rascals Yes, idiot! I’m a hero. I’ll save the lives of my village people Remember one thing, cancer of humans get cured with medicines Dirty politicians like you are the real cancer in society. Damn! Hey, maybe these people would forgive your sins going helpless. But there is God, he won’t forgive. You’ll face it Son in law is back - What happened, Govindu? Where is MLA? - Say, son in law She’d have broken her word, right? You wait man. Why didn’t MLA come, Govindu? That is… - She won’t come She is MLA and thus she won’t come. We are all mad fellows We’ve been waiting here from morning without eating and attending works Still, what would she sitting in AC rooms know about our problems. Move on Hey, you wait. Son in law, say what did MLA say Say Govindu, what happened? What can he say asking repeatedly? Even his friend might have cheated like all the other MLAs It’s the same, right? - Yes Understood now! Our uncle plays a drama with different getup every day, but life of these MROs, MLAs itself is a play We believed as you said. Damn it, move on - Wait! Say something Govindu Kittu, get up. Hey Kittu! Son, Kittu! Uncle! God has taken away our Kittu, uncle Oh God, what have you done? - Oh God Hey, you took him to town hospital and also that MLA recommended No idea whom she said and what, uncle. They threw us outside the hospital, uncle They didn’t even let us in, uncle - So, MLA’s word didn’t work? They said not to let us in unless we pay 5 Lacks, uncle Govindu bro, nothing will happen to me, right? All at my school are saying I will die. You’d take care of me, right? Hey Govindu! Hey, all of you together have killed my son. You’ve killed As you said that MLA would help us, I believed you and handed over my son but you killed him I called you so many times, idiot. You’ve killed, idiot Even that MLA didn’t lift the call along with you. What is our sin, Govindu? Leave, don’t touch. Where is the foundation spot? I’ll bury my son right there Son Kittu! Are you going away, Kittu? My son! My Kittu, are you going away? The rain drenching me knows how much I have cried that day I’ve turned fake Baba just to save the cancer patients of my village That God knows about all that I’m saying you all this with a faith that you’d understand I just knew you’d make me laugh all these days, but you made me cry Oh no, saffron dress! - Oh God! Govindu, I’ll be with you from now - There’d be a great risk in that Still, I’ll come - Really? - Yes - Promise! Ok Who is he? Another fake Baba like me? Thank you Sir, I found the way My God! What is she wearing? Hey Sundari, you are given money to buy dress like this and not to buy a sari What’s the difference guys? Columbus, we are going into the water - Bye We will come back with Gold - All the best Good luck, all the best All the best!
