[hastened footsteps] [door rattling] - [door rattling] - [boy panting] [boy] That's all right. Come on. Quick. [yelling at a distance] - [boy 2] Fuck you! - [yelling indistinctly] - [boy 3] I will fucking kill you! - [boy 4] Let's go. [boy 2] Open the fucking door. [cursing indistinctly] [banging on door] [banging on door] Dare! [boy 1] Open up, sons of bitches! [chair creaks] - [boy 3] Open the door. - [boy 1] Fucking little bitch! Now what, bitch? - [whistling] - [stick thuds] [whistling continues softly] [whistling continues] So, uh, who broke this? They did it, sir. [boy wailing] He did it, man. [guard] Well, how fortunate you weren't hurt. Hmm. Move. [yells] Move! [banging on door] [guard] Open the door, Dare. Hey, Rooster. My little handsome man. Look at you. Come here. Come over here. Listen, I need you to come to the door and unlock it, and I will protect you from these terrible boys. Now, Roost, look at me. Hey, hey. Hi. Come here. Open the door. It's me. I'll protect you, I promise. Turn the TV on, Roost, and I'll be right there. [guard] Don't you dare. Roost, don't even think... Roost, don't do it. Roost. Turn it up, buddy. Roost, turn that off. Turn it off! - [boys giggling] - Shut it! Listen to me. Listen to me. I'll tell you one more fucking time. Open the fucking door now. [door banging] Open the fucking door. Open it. This is gonna cost you more than you know, tough guy. [horses galloping on TV] [banging on door] [narrator] When you're a kid, there's something special. Something fearless and free that we all possess. A light in our eyes that feeds on all the beautiful and amazing things that could be if everything would just listen. We hold on to this magic .. - The day we're hurt. - [door bangs open] Their childhood was taken from them, early, by people who were meant to protect it. They were men in uniforms and badges, but there were no uniforms or badges in the men themselves. [western music playing] [old western music playing] [siren blaring] [indistinct radio chatter] - Top of the morning to you. - Hey. Can I see your license and registration, please? Sure thing. Listen, I'm actually on... Yup. [clears throat] [dispatcher] 19 Sergeant, go ahead. You know why I pulled you over there, partner? Uh... Not too sure. I missed that turn off Bundy? [scoffs] Yeah, you missed the turn off Bundy. You also rolled right through the light, which is a no-turn on red, and you failed to signal. [derisively] Did you miss the turn off Bundy? Gosh! I'm sorry officer but what I was trying to tell you is that I'm on the job. Here's my... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Wait! Wait! I'm a cop. I'm a cop. Take it easy for Christ's sakes. [officer 2] Holster your sidearm. Son, holster your sidearm. - Holster it. - [officer 1 stuttering] He... [officer 2 clears throat, whispering] Wow. I am sorry. I... I am so sorry. He didn't realize you were on the job. How the hell do you guys do things out here? Don't you use the call signs? I clearly identified myself as an officer for Christ's sake. Yes, we use all the standard procedures. We use all the standard procedures, but he's a special case. You see, his partner, his partner died on duty two months ago. Okay? He's having a hard go at it. Okay? He's just off leave, and that's why he's been assigned to me. Yeah? Well, maybe he needs to take a little more time off, huh? You did take the turn without signaling. I'm a cop. Oh, I know. So, set an example. [officer 2] Where's your cruiser? What's your rank? What's your unit? What precinct are you out of? Give me three guys you were in the academy with. Who's your CO? Who's your partner? Where do you patrol? What side of the car do you approach? And how do off-duty officers identify themselves? [waitress singing "Happy Birthday" in opera style] ♪ Happy Birthday ♪ ♪ To ♪ ♪ You ♪ Roost, you have to know these things, okay? You have to know them so well, that no one will ever question you. Okay? What happened today wasn't the first time, but that's okay. But if it happens again, we won't be helping anymore. All right? We'll be off the streets. And I can't promise you... What? Can't promise me what? I won't be protecting the good people and their families, and our brothers in uniform, and more importantly, you. Okay? My own brother. You're why I do this. Okay? Finish up. [crickets chirping] [banging on door] Roost? Yeah. Everything okay, pal? Yeah. Safety knock, please. [knocks slowly in a rhythm] It's late, buddy. - Can I stay in here, please? - Roost. You can't keep coming in here. You gotta get used to your own room. All right? You gotta grow up. Just one more time, please. There's whispering up there. It's not fair, Roost. I have to be up early in the morning. [door closes] Come on. There's no whispering up there. Your room's the safest place in this apartment. It's elevated, faces the west side, it's perfectly hidden. I even put motion sensors above your room. Birds chirping? No. Well, then... Dare? Yeah, Roost. Do you ever think about the home? It's behind us now. Just go to sleep, buddy. All right? Get some sleep. [gulps softly] [narrator] Dare had set a perimeter. He knew every street, every back alley, every hiding spot, and every vantage point. Each apartment, each house, each business was under his protection. It was his community, his responsibility. He was, as he liked to say, "The dog behind the gate." [subtle tense music playing] [narrator] A crushed, enforced piece of metal is his horse of justice. She was pressured and molded the same way they were. Manufactured and sold to this troubled world, just like them. The Bucephalus, the Marengo. This was his traveler. [solemn music playing] [solemn music continues playing] [old western music from TV playing] I'm Deputy Roost, and I'm the law in these parts now. You can walk out of town peaceful, or you can get dragged out of town in a box. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Ah! [groans] [bullets ricocheting in TV] [imitating gunshots] Bam! Bam! Bam! [groans, sighs] [groans] Oh! You got me. [chuckles] [sniffles] [sniffles] [horse neighs on TV] [laughing] You are... bugging today. He was a stupid motherfucker. You know what? We need to hit that new club up tonight. - We need to get our sparkly on... - What you got? Show me. We should hit the club and drop it like it's hot. - Come on, you know. Show me. - I ain't messing with you today. - Show me, bitch. Drop it. - Oh, please hoe. You wanna do this? Let's go. What's with the bag down? Okay! Okay! - [men whistling] - Hi, boys. You gotta get your back... Wha... Ah! [chuckles] You see it? You like it from the front or the back. - Okay, oh, oh. - Not those broke-ass motherfuckers. Keep walking. Keep walking. - Ooh, please, boo-boo. - Got a little fucking... He got a sweat ring. What's he... Please! - That's the clearance counter. - [chuckles] [chuckles] What? [slaps] That's the clearance rack. God! You crazy. Whoa, wait. Is that Dare? Is that Dare? - Oh, let's go fuck with him. - Let's get him, boo. Cookie, what are you doing? I have to sit on your jacket, sweetie pie, 'cause I'm burning my ass off. You don't mind, do you, papi? - You got underwear on? - [chuckles] - [whispers] No. - Can't you smell it, honey? I know it smells like honey. Real women don't wear underwear, Mr. Dare. Besides, that's a rude question. That is a rude question. Why should we be confined to your social sexist agenda? - We hang out... - [together] And we bang out. I'll stop by the dry cleaners on the way home. For what? She just gave you a gift. You could sell that jacket for $1,000. She gave you a spin cycle for no extra charge. - You hit it again, Cookie. - What's, what... All over that. Your girlfriend's gonna be jealous. Girls, give me some information before I shoot the both of you. Information. What happened, that fucking... That bar on Pico, what's the name of it? It was robbed. I don't know. McFryer's or some shit. - For how much? - $1,400. The stupid motherfucker left his wallet at the bar. - You got it? - You know I did. I snatched it right up. - That's right. Undercover ops. - That's good. This is good. Christopher Piaz. All right. What else? There's a John. Been running the game on all the girls. When it comes time to pay, he been stiffin'. Does he hurt anyone? - He hurt mummy's pocket book. - Nah, that's too small, Joan. By this time next month, he won't be giving anymore freebies. What about Jimmy? He's been messing with you guys? Oh, not since the last time you beat that ass. Girls, you're on these streets all fucking day, and that's it? Take it easy, Captain. This ain't South-Central. It's been dry out there lately. - But it's nice and wet in here. - All right. - Ooh. - [Cookie laughing] I've gotta go meet somebody, ladies. - You never know. - [Dare] Goodbye. Winky's back. - You a dumb ho, Cookie! - What? He was gonna hear. Let's just go to the movies. It's Sunday. I can't deal with this please. Then, you shouldn't have opened your mouth in the first place, bitch. - He's gonna find out. - Listen to me. Enough girls. Enough. I want information on him. - Here you go. Take that. - Fucking broken nail. [scoffs] We ain't renting a movie today, baby. Go see a matinee. Take it. I ain't touchin' it. You hear me? He's crazy bad, and I ain't touchin' it. [car door opens] [car door closes] I got you, okay? I got you. Thought you were going back to nursing school, Cookie. Yeah, me too. I thought you were marrying that pretty girl. Where's your ring at? Joan, please take it elsewhere. Hey, Dare. You really believe in me? Yes, I do, Cookie. - You do? - Mm-hmm. I love you, papi. - [Cookie sniffles] - [car door opens] [siren wailing] [car door closes] You're late, Detective. Is that the professional behavior you exhibit on your way to earning that rank? No, you are right, JT. It's buzzing out there. I'm sorry. You know, I cut my teeth back in New York. Now, let me tell you something. That is one tough city, especially back in the 70s. Cops on the take, filthy streets, hard to keep your nose clean. I'm never late, JT. Hey, want some Coffee? - Yeah, sure. - Better than usual. Hey, Dare. What can I get for you today? I'll have a Tuna sandwich on rye, slice of tomato, hold the fries, please. Perfect. I'll have them rush this for you. How about a song later? Sure. - [JT chuckles] - [Dare] Thank you. Okay, come on, what's up? Tell me what's going on. No, just frustrated with the job and all the bullshit, JT. There's so much fuckin' trash out there. [sighs heavily] Something has to change. I mean, you don't understand. I'm the only one out there and I can't do it all. Fuckin' Winky's back on the street. Okay, Dare, there's always a Winky, a Big Marcus, a Jumbo Rodriguez. That's the job. Listen, why don't you take a transfer? No, it's my beat. It's the only beat left I can control. Control? Control? [chuckles] Dare, you can't control a damn thing and that's the job. It'll never change. I can change, maybe, you can change, but the job will never ever change. You got to accept that. So what if you went to a different precinct? No. No new transfer, no... No new precinct. I'll just work through it. All right, what if you kept the same detail and move to a different neighborhood. [sighs] JT, what do you mean a different neighborhood? It's my neighborhood. I live there. I can't just pick up and leave. Is that what you did when you got fed up? Did you just up and abandon your post? Switch divisions? What? You know, I keep telling myself there's a good boy in you. I'm sorry. ♪ Someday you realize The big surprise ♪ ♪ Someday you fall upon A life that's gone ♪ ♪ And pass you by... ♪ I had a long tour today, JT. Why don't you just give that sandwich to Mary-Ann and give her my best. Okay? [bangs on table] I should go. There are people out there that need me and I'm... You're the only one. [chuckles] Yeah, I've heard that before. The last front. Dare, make sure you get the right people. [male radio host] Welcome back to the Green-light Hour. We're talking with Roost in West LA. Roost, there are a myriad of ways to live your life. Since every blossom begins with a seed, why not start there? So, I'm the answer? Or... I have to search inside of myself to find the answer? [radio host] One and the same, Roost. The answer finds its vitality within you and encircles your entire being. When you recognize it, it will recognize you. Roost, your intentions are true. Listen to the thoughts that make you feel good inside and follow them. Why? Because they're positive. Yes, I do... I have those positive thoughts and they make me feel happy. [sighs softly] I just... I have a lot of other ones. Scary ones. The fear's in the anticipation, Roost. Take control of your life, and the positive thoughts will follow. Do something bold. Do something bold. Roost, I have to take another call. Can I trust that you will capture every moment in your life? [chuckles nervously] Well, I'll sure try. Good. And remember, Roost, you are valid. You are strong. You should be heard. I am... [radio host] I can. I am. I can. Tyler from Phoe... - [radio host] - [Roost] I... Welcome to the Green-light. -I can. I am. I can. I am! I can! I am! I can! I am! I can! [crows cawing at a distance] [wind rattling] [slow tense music playing] Well, I'm sorry that I had to shoot you, Dare. I guess I'm the duke now. You're the duke? You're not the duke, Roost. What did you shoot? Wasn't me. Yes, I got you once in the chest and once in the shoulder. That means I'm the duke. No, you hit the ceiling and you hit the floor. Sorry, buddy. No, no, I didn't. I hit you once. I hit you once. I saw. I'm getting closer. You hit me once in the shoulder and once in the chest? Yes, once in both. Did you hit me once or twice? - I saw that I got you. - You didn't see anything because you had your eyes closed every time you pulled the trigger. - [birds chirping] - Could you put those birds away? And turn the radio down. And what do you got cooking? And Roost. Roost. - Sorry. - Why is the TV on and you're not watching TV? I'll fix it. Roost? I'm making hotdogs. Do you want one? Come in here. Well, fix it, please. Fix what? And the tower. And the candy shop. What else? Nothing, I swear. What else? That's four citations I count, partner. Come on. We're going live tonight. We got a lot of work to do. No, Dare! It's Sunday. It's our day off. Now is the time, okay? We'll pick up some OT. Make some extra money. We need it. No! I don't want to go on patrol. I wanna go to Griffith Park and pet the horses. You wanna make detective, Rooster, huh? You need to put in the time. And not ask questions. Please. Go. [sighs, sniffles] [narrator] Winky's resurgence was getting to him. He couldn't think of anything else. Roost wasn't going along on this job. Winky was way more dangerous these days, and he knew that better than anyone. One rookie mistake, and they could both be killed. This needed to be handled quickly and professionally. On this one, Randy rides alone. [man] Oh, yeah, you bet. Oh! [blowing raspberries] Ooh, I'm officially in love with that new desk clerk. Snitch from La Brea crew says Winky's back on the West-side, Sarge. That's us. Her ass, her ass... it's like an apple, you just wanna [squeaks], you wanna polish it. She's gotta be like what, 23, 24, maybe? [grunts] God! I'm 50 years old. [chuckles] But I'm still on the clock, buddy. Boom! [laughs mischievously] Man... I could be her father. Or you may be her father. You guys actually look alike. Just in the face area. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. She... She's in her early 20s. At that time, I was, uh... I was, uh... [sighs, imitates explosion] You fucked up the fantasy, man. Check this out. This is his file. This guy is gonna make waves, Sarge. Aggravated assault and battery, burglary, drug trafficking, I mean, Grand theft, suspected gang affiliation. Santa Cruz, Dan. Every day scumbag. Hey, listen, before I forget, pal, can you do me a favor? Take a look at my draft picks from the season. Tell me what you think. Yeah, no, I will. I just think that maybe if we... I'm taking home $2,500 if I win it all. - [clicks tongue] - That's cool, but I think we should tail some of his... Unless that fat fuck Hernandez wins 'cause he always does. Every single year. I don't know... - [Dan clears throat] - Gentlemen. - Hi, Lieutenant. - [Dan] LT, how are you sir? Roman, what's all this I'm hearing from ICE about Adrian Diaz? - Who? - That's Winky. Winky, sir. I got 15 faxes this morning with 10-99s written all over them telling me to make sure this guy becomes a priority. I'm all over it. I was actually just briefing Detective Morrison on his whereabouts. I've got an inside over at the La Cienega crew - and... - La Cienega, huh? - La Brea. - Huh? - La Brea. - Oh, right. [chuckles] Yeah, my inside at the La Brea crew tipped me this morning, tipped me off, and this is his file. It's interesting. He's a real piece of work. Lieutenant, he's Peruvian-born. He's been deported three times in the last eight years, and he's wanted for multiples in Santa Cruz, West LA, and San Diego, as far as we know. But he's also wanted in question for the slaying of two officers. I want you to find out where he is. I want this piece of shit out of the city yesterday, Roman. You and Morrison take the lead on this one, you hear? - Okay. - I'll get an unmarked on his crew this afternoon, and I'll get with the Tech guys about setting up a wire. I want results, and I want to be kept in the loop. - All right? - [together] Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Absolutely. - Have a good day, gentlemen. - Thank you, Lieutenant. You too. [Roman] You too, sir. [clear throat] All right. This is good. This is good. Here's what we're gonna do, okay? [exhales loudly] I'll take care of the undercover. I'll get with, I don't know, Ram... Ah! Ramos is still working Crenshaw. Leo. Let's talk to Leo. Can you pop in his office and see what he's... Robert, she's wearing a thong. Dan? And Leo's white. Leo's white. Leo is white, Dan. And that is why they'd never suspect him. [heavy metal music playing] Christopher Piaz? What? Fucking what, man? Yeah? Why you pounding on my door, faggot? [chuckles] Sorry. I just had to ask. How fucking stupid are you? What? [groans in pain] Fuck! You will never put your hands on an officer. Assaulting a detective is a felony. - Get down. - Fuck! [panting] - Get down. Give me your hands. - [panting] [groaning] You fuckin' broke my nose, you fuck! [exhales loudly, sputters] - [straining] Fuck, man! - What is that right there? - What? What's what? - Right there, across the street. [sighs] I don't know, man. You robbed a bar that you live across the street from. What the fuck is the matter with you? - What? I don't... - Let me repeat myself. It doesn't look like I'm getting through to you. You robbed a bar for $1,400 across the street from where you live. And you left your wallet. Oh, that's bullshit. I didn't! What are you... [panting] This is police brutality, man. Fucking breaking my nose. - What are you... - Oh, wow. One from each grandmother, right? That's all I got, man. - All right. Don't move. - Fuck! [radio chimes] Suspect in question for McFryer's robbery is in custody. Please send a car to the perp's address at 738 - Ow! Fuck! [groans] - Pico! Pico Boulevard. [crying] Ah! Fuck, man! What kind of a fucking cop are you? [chains jingle] [solemn music playing] [narrator] He doesn't enjoy stealing and is completely aware that it's a misdemeanor and can also be a felony. But Dare doesn't view it as stealing. He's taking back from the corrupt, immoral, delinquent people and using it for the cause. The criminals of this city keep him employed. Maybe, the day will come where he won't be able to run his operation anymore, but you know what, wishing and hoping for that is just an excuse to pass the buck. Winky. Winky. Winky. Plotting with his band of outlaws amongst the dregs this community ignores. Would he show his face? Or just ghost like he did last time. Dare had 500 copies of his mugshot and rap sheet printed out. He also had them add a large, emboldened "Wanted" mark on the front and back to make it more noticeable. He covered every stop along the north perimeter. Tomorrow, he'd do the south and so on. Still, he couldn't shake the thought of him. He needed to clear his mind. He needed Violet.

Can you rest? [dispatcher] 1-14, please report to the Bodega Pizza on Bundy in response to last night's 2-11. Witness has information on perps. [clattering] [grim music playing] [gunshot] [indistinct muttering] [girl screaming] [shelf clattering] [Dare] The call came in approximately 7 p.m. This is last night. Half an hour after I threw in the towel. Three perps in white masks. Midnight teller said they approached from the front and the rear entrance. - [gunshot]. - Get on the mother fucking back goddamn it! [clattering] - Get the fuck down! - What are you doing? Get out! Get out before I call the cops. Why you have both is a mystery to me. You might as well put a register outside and add a third entrance behind the counter. So, anyway, they come in and they split up. To the untrained eye, it looks like, I don't know, they're robbing the place. They take all your money, they take all your knockoff jewellery, and just for good measure, they put one in your man's back. [muffled yelling] Let's go, go, go, go. So, you get the picture. Now, I really need you to help me 'cause these are horrible, horrible people, Keith. Is that your real name? Your real name is Keith? No, it's not. No, it is not. Keith is an American name. This is exactly what's wrong with this community. See, I... I don't even know who you are. And you don't even know who I am. Nobody knows who anybody is. And you don't have cameras. Why not? Or security gates? Or a security booth. And your name is Keith. Yes. Kevin. All right. Why not? Kevin. Keith. Steve. John. All right. [door bell dings] - [man] Dave. - Shit. - No, it's Dare. - Dare? All right. I dare you. I knew you had one of those different names. How you doing? It's been a long time. You're still working over at, uh... It's been ages. Where do you work again? - Private sector. - Oh, private sector. - Good money in there. - It's all right, yep. Oh, this is Detective Morrison. - Hi. How you doing? - Okay. So, what are you doing over here? - They have you working on this? - No. Uh, I was on my way to work, stopped in for a drink, saw the tape up. What's happening? Hey! What do you mean? It's a fuckin' Paki deli. Just a fuckin' shit storm. Looks like it's Winky's crew. We're not sure. I don't know. Right. The fuckin' masks. - Dan, give me two. - Okay. You know trying to talk to the guy who got shot yesterday but that's impossible because he's in the ICU. Idiot they have working today needs a fuckin' translator. It's impossible. How do we allow these places to run this way? No security cameras. No fuckin' gates. So, what are you gonna do? You know, I don't know. What are you gonna do? Anyway, it was good seeing you again. All right. If you're ever in the area, stop by the precinct. You know, Tuesday and Thursday nights we have card game, so... Texas hold 'em, 25 buy in, no limit. Stop by. I'll get you in the game. - Want me to come by? - Absolutely. - Thank you. - Oh, uh... You're welcome to bring a couple of chicks if you want. - Will do. - [laughs] Uh, excuse me, detective. - What? - What happened to your drink? You said that, uh, you came in here for a drink, right? They didn't have ice tea. Good luck. Thank you. [narrator] The same rules that apply to civilians don't apply here. When Dare takes the night off, a deadly criminal commits a crime and get's away with it. He completely missed his opportunity to nab Winky last night, and risked exposing himself to fellow detectives. Morrison knew something was up. All of his sensors were going off. It's actually the sign of a great detective to push like he did. Dare wishes that Roost had those same instincts. [exhales loudly] Just control it. Just control it. - Son of a bitch. - [Cookie crying] [yelling indistinctly] [yelling, crying continues] God dammit! Jimmy! What did I tell you the last time, huh, Jimmy? - What did I say? - [Jimmy] Fuck back in your... -[Cookie] Dare, get back. -[Dare] What did I say? Come here. - Come here, you fuckin... - [Cookie yells indistinctly] [Jimmy groans] - Fuck! I hate you! - Get that bitch off me. - [Dare] Cookie, get in the car. - [Cookie] I fuckin' hate you. [Dare] Get in the car. Go. What now, bitch! You wanna be you your bitch's... Bitch, if you don't break my bread, I'm gonna break your fuckin' hand. Jimmy! Dare. Damn. Winky back on the track? Fuck you, man! Let me see your hand. - What? - Let me see that hand. Are you taking my shit? Oh. Hittin' women. Huh? [groaning] - Man get the fuck off. Oh, man! - [screaming] [indistinct radio chatter] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He said I owed him money. I don't owe him money. What the fuck, Cookie? What the fuck? I thought... - I'm sorry. - I fuckin' told you, Cookie, to stay away from him. I thought we'd been through this. I'm startin' to think you're a fuckin' masochist. I'm a hoe, Dare, what do you expect? Yeah. You're a tramp, and I'm a sucker. You're chasing pimps, and I'm chasing demons. - Gimme it. - Let me keep it for protection. I feel something bad is gonna happen. I feel... I don't know. I'm scared. I'm so scared, Dare. Please. - [crying] Let me keep it. - You don't need it. I was at church on Sunday lighting three candles. I feel it in my heart something bad is gonna happen to me. - Cookie. - I know. I know it. You don't need a gun, Cookie. Gimme it. I'm here. You have me. [sniffles] Listen, papi, I heard you asking about Winky and... You gotta stop bearing that shit out. It's, it's gonna get you killed. Not if I find them first. Where is he, Cookie? - I know you know. - I don't know. I don't know. Why you asking me? I don't know. Why would you say that? I don't know. 'Cause I'm a detective. It's what you didn't say. I know you know. - Cookie, do the right thing. - I don't know. You've always had a big mouth. - Just help me catch this guy. - I try... This is my life, Dare. It's not a joke. [Cookie exhales] What? Fuck this punk-ass motherfucker! Fuck you want, huh? [man 1] You know how it is. [man 2] She be drinking too much, ese. Like me. Brave, man. Detective, West LA. Okay, brave cop. What you want? I wanna find Winky and fuck him in the ass. God dammit! Fuck! [car rattles] [cursing in Spanish] Guess I found the right place. Hector. Take it easy. Let me talk to the detective. [speaking Spanish] [cursing in Spanish] Oh, I'm beginning to think you're a little crazy, ese. You know I can have the homies take your ride, break it down, no one would ever see you again? And you don't have enough bullets in those pretty guns for all my people, do you? Got about ten of them. Guarantee you get the first one, Evelio. Why don't you just tell me what you want so I can get back to work? I know who you are. And I know you know where he is. Well, if you know who I am, you know I can't speak on that. All I can say is I haven't seen Winky in a minute. And I know he's not banging anymore. Then, why did your fucking little pinata try to crack my skull open when I mentioned his name? Well, that's a fucking respect thing. - You know that. - All right. Who's hittin' all the old shops? Look, you should leave it alone. Let sleeping dogs lie, you know. No, you should tell me who's responsible. I'll make this place so hot, you'll be working on these cars out of your living room. Who's responsible? Well, that's the thing, ese. We trying to figure that out too 'cause it ain't us. Maybe, it's that punk-ass Angel. Angel Reyes? What does he have to do with this? - He doesn't roll with your crew. - That's what I'm saying, man. Pinche They got a small-time crew of their own. They've been hitting spots making it look like other clicks. Maybe, you should check it out for yourself. You know, Angel was supposed to hit that spot tonight over on Pico. Porno shops, sells the book and shit. - Yeah. - That's your hood, right? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - West-side. Well, you bust him, you put all the shit to bed. Why would you let them do that? It's making you look bad. Bringing heat on your gente. I don't make the rules, man. It's getting late, ese. You should go now. Crazy motherfucker. [western music playing on TV] [chuckles] [birds chirping] [on TV] Go ahead, go ahead, I can't read any of that. I am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom I feel I can trust. I hardly did like, did trust, Judge Garby. [narrator] Winky, aka Adrian Diaz better known as "the devil." He's a scumbag, street thug, who's had multiple felony arrests but always seems to slip right between the dirty cracks this city has to offer. He was on Dare's most wanted list as number four until he supposedly took the lives of two fellow officers in the '02 Santa Cruz bank heist. An informant recently leaked that he still wears those fallen officers' badges on his belt. Such a rotten human. It makes Dare feel dirty and uncomfortable that he's back in town, that in some fearful, altered twist of fate, Roost and he could actually cross paths, or that he might run into Violet at the club. Not on Dare's watch. [stick thuds] [Dare] Hey! [panting] [groans] [grunts] Come on, mother fucker. Come on. [revolver cocks] ese? - What's up, -Fuck! Yeah, motherfucker, two times in one day. Small world, huh? Huh? - Any luck finding Angel? - Not yet. You guys see Winky around here anywhere? [Hector] Pinche gringo hits hard, eh? Yeah, I told you he was a bad ass carnal. [thugs grunting] [Hector] You fucker! What do you got? What do you got? Who you got? [speaking Spanish] [amused] Look at what this white boy's packing. - Tranquilo. - Fucking John Wayne, ese, huh? Easy with that shit. Gimme that. Well? What is it? You some kind of a fucking hero? Not in this story, puto. [grunts] [grunts] [Hector] Motherfucker! - How you like this? - [Evelio] Easy, easy. - How you like this? - Easy, easy, easy, carnal. Go get the car. I'll take care of this. - Fucking puto. - [Dare wails in pain] Oh, you're all fucked up, pinche cop. I told you to leave it alone, huh? [grunts] I knew you wouldn't though. [chuckles] I can see that batty look in your eye. You know I used to see the same thing in my eyes years ago. But you know what happened? Color of my eyes changed, man. They're not angry at the world anymore. They're not vengeful. They don't see blood. Street credit now. You know what they see? [chuckles softly] They see a lucky bastard living and breathing surrounded by mi familia. By my people. One peek in the mirror, and all that changed, man. So, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna do you a favor. I'm gonna be your mirror, ese. Hey, look at me. Winky wants you dead, ese. He don't like loose ends. But I don't wanna kill you, man. And if it's between you and me, Winky's invisible now, and so are you. Hey! Don't break the mirror. [crickets chirping] [narrator] He couldn't remember much of that night. He had no recollection of getting into the traveler or returning home. [solemn music playing] Stampeded to within an inch of his life, broken nose, mashed ribs, and a crushed left hand, and it was his own fault. Angel Reyes wasn't involved. It was a setup he should've been able to read a mile away. Instead, he was obsessed with catching Winky. [Evelio] You should leave it alone. Let sleeping dogs lie, you know. [footsteps echoing slowly] [toy gun squeaking] - What are you doing, cowboy? - Dare. Do you ever think about the home? Why are we back here? [whistling] [footsteps approaching] [Dare grunts] - [boy 1 laughing maniacally] - [boy 2] Come back here, you little bitch. We're gonna beat the shit out of you. [boy 1] Oh, you really want it, huh? Come here, you little bitch. - -[boy 2] We're gonna kill you. [boy 1 laughing maniacally] - [whistling continues] - [footsteps getting closer] [Dare grunts] All right. Just stay there. Stay there. - [chairs rattle] - Just stay right there. - [whistling grows louder] - [footsteps grows louder] - [stick creeks] - [yelling] Come on! Come on now! What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? - [tense music rises in tempo] - [whistling grows louder] [whistling stops] [boy whimpering] [panting] [projector machine whirring] What happened to you? Who beat you up? How long have I been sleeping, Roost? Three days. What the heck happened out there? Did you... Did you get him? I got too close. I got too sloppy. And I... I... [crying] I fucked up. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. You're home now. Carroll says that when you're with your family, you've already arrived at the destination. [Dare] Hmm, yeah. Yeah. [groans] Easy, buddy. It's all right. We'll be fine. We'll be all right. I just... I just didn't... I just... Just part of the job and I... I just wasn't thinking straight. Don't get upset. You're... You're getting better. Dare, look, look. It's the scene from the cockpit. - Two more minutes. - I've already waited too long. -Here we go. -No, we don't. Get a hold of yourself, you yella... [narrator] Watching his brother, he had an epiphany. If he had never returned that night, how long would Roost have lasted? How many John Wayne films would he have watched before he got nervous? How much junk food would he eat? And what would he do? He was so genuinely happy. Not because of the movie or John Wayne or the diner food. It was the comfort the safety he felt with Dare home. He was impulsive and made decisions that could have cost him his life and potentially Roost's. Winky was out there actively committing crimes, but he didn't care. He wasn't chasing the bullet anymore. [slow romantic music playing on the radio] [indistinct chattering] - [JT] Oh, really? - [Hope chuckles] [JT] Oh, this guy, needing you, I know. Why does he get a dance? [Hope clicks tongue] He didn't want a song. Ah! Not that your voice is any less wonderful. - Oh, thank you. - [JT chuckles] Well, why does he get a song? Dare, it's the chief's birthday today, you know that. [grunting] Ah, lovely. Happy birthday. - Thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. [sighs heavily] - What? - [scoffs] Well, your face looks better. Can I have a cup of coffee, please? No. Wow. Guess I stepped on some toes, huh? Never mind the birthday, what am I missing here? What's going on? JT, you know what? You were right. There's always gonna be dirt, and I can't spend my life trying to rid myself off of all of it. And I'm sorry that I was disrespectful to you. - Whoa. - Open this. [sighs] That's really a nice gesture, Detective. You remembered. You're a good boy, Dare. Thank you. Wow. Proud and honorable friend. That's great. Mary-Ann's gonna be jealous. She bought me a science fiction book. [JT chuckles] Stand up, son. That's okay, JT. You just take that. No, no. Stand up. Come on, stand up. Come on, Dare. Stop trying to control everything. Come on. Come on. You're making a scene. It's okay. Thank you for the gift. I appreciate it. You're welcome. [waitress] I'm getting this on camera. Ah! Yep, smile this way. Some clowns just took a picture of that. Yes, I did, and I'm gonna take another one right now - from the back. - You know what, you take... You take one more, I'll tell you he's gonna get it. Hey, hey, hey, he's holding me again. He's holding me. I'm not asking you to. I'm not asking you to do anything, Dan. Just have my back once in a while. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't give me that shit. Don't give me that shit. This isn't patrol we're doing. We're not following procedure with this guy. It's been three weeks, Robert. What? I thought you were strong-arming people, so what? You know? What do you want from me? Look, Dan, listen, I just want you to tell the lieutenant that we've got him. That I'm a straight cop doing my job, Dan, that because of me, we're closing in. Not sit there and nod while we're being reamed out as if we had it coming in the first place. Come on, man. Who did I interview? Who did I interrogate and harass from Winky's crew without you there? Who's fucking rights did I violate? - This is bullshit, man. - Look! Hey, look, I don't know where that's coming from. I don't. But somebody complained. It landed on LT's lap and that's why we ended up in the meeting. Okay? You gotta know that. All right? I didn't want this case. I could give a shit about this joker. Really. He's a piece of shit. Hey, the DEA wants him. Let them have him. It's a good case for them. They've got the manpower, they got the resources. I mean, what is it with you? You're married to Winky or something. What is this? The entire police force is after this idiot. - It's gotta be us? - Dan, I did the work. I did the work on this guy. We used my network of informants. I submitted the first tangible forensics on this guy. I might as well drawn a map to his fucking house. And now that we're about to knock on the door, that's it? It is bigger than us. You understand? It's fucking bigger than us. Get your head out of your ass. I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to say that. Get your head out of your ass. Okay? Stop. Come on. Grab your fucking tampons and let's go. Dan. Come on, man. - One more week. - Okay, okay. I'll talk to Brannigan in the morning. Then, we do one more week. - Okay? - That's all I need. - That's all I fucking need from you. - Okay. -Let's go, Dudley Do Right -So why do you have to be - so fucking crazy all the time, man? - Me? Well, buddy, if there was a camera in here and just saw what you were fucking doing... Maybe, there are cameras in there. - I started the shouting? - Yeah. You started the fucking shouting war, man. Now, I'm trying to talk to you reasonably, and you're fucking shouting in my face. [Dan] People would lock your ass up. [Carroll] A young man was working on his ranch one day when he accidentally happened to knock time into a nearby well. He lived by his time and for his time. And so naturally, he became very distressed. This was a strong and influential man and his ties to the community was such that he gathered and involved as many people as he could to help him retrieve his precious time. And then, one fateful dusk, when the sun was set to set, a fully gray man rappelled down into the well and he found his precious time sitting comfortably on a tiny ledge in the wall. The man was so overjoyed that he didn't notice his old friend looked quite different and seemed almost content. He was jubilant, and he said, "I've dug and I've searched forever to find you. I knew you were down here, and that I could have you back if I didn't stop." And to that, time simply replied, "Well, no pun intended, what have you lost? What exactly have you given up to find me, your precious time, your invaluable time?" The next day, the man sealed the well shut and he did not bring time back in his pocket. But he knew in that moment, the true value of time. The past is always different if you happen to catch up to it. Live in the now with each new breath you take. Do something courageous. Do something bold. Do something new. I want you to say I am. I can. [crow caws] [insects rattling] [wind howling] Looks like there's a new Sheriff in town. That was a nice one. - So, what do you think? - What do I think about what? Am I the duke? No, Roost, you're not the duke. You have to earn that title. It's not just about being a good marksman. It's about being a complete officer. Besides, my ribs are busted. That's what I wanna talk to you about. - You wanna talk about my ribs? - No. About me being a detective. A complete one. Now? We've been through this. It didn't fit. You know that. Well, I want a chance to redeem myself. I wanna be out there on the streets protecting this city and our brothers. Everything is changed, Roost. The assignment has, we're gonna be working in a different capacity. - I'll pick up where you left off. - No, Roost. Yeah, yeah. I will follow up on your leads. I will reestablish the perimeter in no time. No. I'm ready. I'm going. Roost, you're not cut out for it. You're not prepared and you're not cut out for it. You know that. You'll die. I almost died. Do something bold. - Do something bold! - Roost. Roost, what are you doing in there? Calm down, okay. Just calm down. I don't wanna leave you. But I will. I am not afraid out there. I am afraid in here. - Roost... - If you don't let me, I will do it myself and I'll mess up. Look, if we're together, you can teach me, you can watch out for me. [gulps] But either way, I'm going. - It's my destiny. - Roost, I... I can't do this anymore. I don't know how this city works. Yes, you do. I lost the pulse of the streets. That's not something you just get back. - You can do it. - No, I don't... No. Roost, these are, these are bad people and dirty streets. - I know. - No, you don't. You don't know. I mean, you have to search to find the good. Like in the home? That's behind us now. Look, you're my brother. You're my best friend. - I don't want you to get hurt. - [sniffles] Then, teach me how to do it right. You... You're gonna have to listen and do everything I say. Yes, sir. ["Better On The Way" by Trevor Menear playing] [narrator] They started with basic training. Roost had to build his core from scratch, and Dare had to seriously tune up. ♪ I'll be on the table Lyin' by your side ♪ ♪ You're so warm and able And tangled in the wire ♪ ♪ Maybe we'll get better Better on the way ♪ ♪ We can still feel young When dark clouds roll our way ♪ ♪ Maybe we'll get better On the way ♪ [narrator] Conduct and behavior, ethics and code, human rights, the interview process, no stone was left unturned. Roost was committed. ♪ I'll still be your honey I'll still be your friend ♪ ♪ Tie our hands together Come and come again ♪ ♪ Come again ♪ ♪ Maybe we'll get... ♪ [narrator] It wasn't always smooth. But it was working. Roost was getting it. He was asking questions and picking up things Dare didn't even notice. ♪ Maybe we'll get better On the way ♪ [narrator] Finally, as a last precaution, his brother learned how to draw, how to really draw like an officer. Dare taught him everything he knew and everything he coveted. He was ready. It's the perfect morning to see the station, Roost. Not a lot of traffic. Unfortunately, an officer died on duty last week. So, most of the precinct is at the memorial. God rest his soul. So, this is where all the information is collected, filtered and stored. Rooster, this is where all the criminals our brothers and I bust are held, processed and kept in custody. Morning, Red. This is a special place for me and you now, okay? This is ground zero. If the entire community would fall, [sighs heavily] this will be the last vertical fixture standing. We'd be here protecting it. Hey, I'm not Oprah. [exhales] He's 250 pounds in his eighth grade, I mean, you read all the signs, you look in the books and newspapers. They say, yeah, obese, okay. My children... [imitating gunshots] Go to the vehicle right now. Go to the vehicle right now. - Why? I was listening. - I know. Go. Now! Gone in two days, you know. I say all I want, bring the antibacterial hand-soap, you know the foaming kind [indistinct] - Who was that? - I don't know. - Who were those two guys? - I don't know. They came in and they just stood over there. - They didn't sign in? - No. - You didn't sign them in? - No. Give me a break! What's the matter? I want everything you have on Winky, okay? I'm going in. - You don't wanna wait for Roman? - Why? But I told her I'm a grown man, I got my vices. - Right. - I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't yell at her fat son for eating my goddamn cold cuts every week. - Right. - [clears throat] All right. Try it on. - Check, check. - Go, go. - You good? - Good. All right. All right, all right, all right. What's up? You wanna let Dan in on this? - Pete, come on. - Bob. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. [groans] [Speaking in Spanish]. Puto? Yeah, where you going, [chuckles] - [whimpers in pain] - [chuckles] You can never get the drop on me cuz. [groans] Mira whay...[panting] Look at what you did to my homeboy, huh. Open up your eyes, motherfucker! [chuckling] Oh, shit. Tu pinche cop fucking with my paper and my familia. Come on. - [groaning] - [panting] That's right, that's right. Give it what you got. Give it all you got, puto cop, huh. The cowboy got a pass, but we fucked him up good, eh? We fucked him up good. But no one's gonna save you faggot. - [siren wailing] - [Morrison wheezing] [panting] Chuey! Chuey, get the fuck up! Chuey! Chuey! - [siren growing louder] - [Morrison gasping] I guess the angels took off today, huh? Too bad for you. [straining] [screaming in agony] [gasping] [siren growing louder] [man] Fuck you, puto. - Fuck you, you piece of shit. - [man chuckles] Fuck you! You see this? This means I fucking win. Come here. - Fuck you, you piece of shit. - [Dan] Sit down. - Okay. - Glasses. What are you, one of them? - Calm down. Sit down. Sit down. - Fuck off. Get your fucking glasses on so you can see. What the hell are you doing down here? Who, me? I don't know. My job, Dan. Well, you're not doing your job any more 'cause I have to take you off the case effective immediately. That fucking waste of life is directly connected to Winky. And guess what. - What? - There's another department - running crossfire on this, Dan. - Oh, no, no. Stop this. Come here. Come here. That spic mentioned another unit tailing them and a cop that they almost killed. Now, why on earth would another team be interested in this guy if he wasn't key? And why am I just finding out about this right now? And where the fuck were you today when I was getting my fuckin' ass kicked? Listen to me carefully, okay, 'cause I'm not talking about this assignment here. I'm gonna talk to you about your job on the force. You're spinning. Hmm? You understand me? You can't see it. You can't. But you are spinning. You were almost killed down here today because of some crack-a-jack fucking hunch. - This guy... - This guy is not anybody. He's not connected to anything. You hear me? - There's eyes on this thing. - Oh, come on. Did you hear what I just said? There are no other eyes. No eyes, no units, no one. Okay? We were the lead on this case and now we're not. Stop this. Stop this. You know what, I swear to God you so much as think about that fucking piece of shit character, and I will march you into Brannigan's office with your badge and your resignation papers. I'll march you in there myself. I've had it. Seriously, I've had it with this shit. Jesus. - Hungry? - Yeah, we're starving. We have the grilled chicken, right, buddy? Yup. Let me start on that bad boy right now. [paper-bag rustling] - Jesus Christ, Roost! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Roost, give me the drinks. - I'm sorry. Put the fries back in the bag. Throw the sandwiches up on the dash. Here. I'm gonna put the drinks over here. Give me the drinks. I'm gonna put 'em over here in the... - Roost, give me the liquids now. - Okay, gosh. Hold that bag up. Hold... Put the fries in the bag. Put 'em in the bag and hold the bag up, up, off of my radar. Hold it up higher. All right. [Roost] Can I put it down now? How did a grilled chicken, slice of tomato, hold the mayo, hold the bun, turn into a cheese burger with... [laughing with exasperation] bacon. 'Cause the grilled chicken didn't come with an action figure. [whispers] Oh, my brother! I'll just eat a protein bar. Oh, look who it is. [whistles] Eh! Can I get some of that? What's the matter? [Dare] Hey, Joan. [grunts] Ah! How's my tall blonde? What? No love for the captain? - What's going on? - Dare. Did I miss something? Where's the funeral? That's funny. I don't know. Do you? No, nobody does. See, normally, you need a body to have a funeral. Yeah, I think that's the way it works, honey. Joan, what the fuck are you talking about? [hysterically] You don't have the right to ask! You lost that privilege. Take off your goddamn sunglasses. You lost that privilege when you asked her to sacrifice her safety for your peace of mind. Wait a second. Are you telling me - Winky killed Cookie? - [crying] My... chica. - Fucking little -Winky killed Cookie? For nine years, we straight tricked. I bet you didn't know that shit, huh? Fuck! Ate together, slept together, just about everything. Dare. - I'm sorry. - That little hoe was my whole life in this fucked up world. Joan. I'm fucking sorry. What do you expect? That's what happens when you fuck with gangsters, Dare. You get killed. I told you he was crazy bad. Didn't I said it? At the fucking hood of your car. Point blank. That girl was the closest thing I will ever have to a child and you got her fucking killed. We saved for a vacation last year. [chuckles woefully] Hooked so hard for three months, our pussies were puffy for three weeks. But we went. Cookie and I got out. We never looked back. Vegas? No. Mexico? Hell, no! This bitch had our asses up in Alaska of all places. Best time of my life. But that's the thing about best times... You never know that's what they are when you're living 'em. She had this thing that she used to do. It's like a... like a tick, like a nervous habit, like biting your nails, that bitch. She would thank God for everything. There's a rainbow in the sky. Thank you, God. Look at those children. Look at those children over there. They're playing. They're happy. Thank you, God. We're having a nice meal today. Thank you, God. Jimmy didn't serve it to us last night. Thank you, God. Thank you God for this and thank you God for that. It used to drive me crazy. Joan, I'm fucking sorry. I'm sorry. I find myself saying the same shit. I'm sorry, Joan. Fuck that hoe. She had a big heart and even bigger mouth, and that's what got her dumb ass in the end. Stupid runty bumping her ass scums bitch. She wanted you to have this. Take it. Where you going, Joan? Hey. It's Sunday. We're going to a movie. [Violet] I don't give a fuck what she wrote. You already read it to me. I'm sorry Cookie is dead, baby, I am. But it don't mean you gotta do stupid shit with your life, Dare. Haven't you learned anything? Can't you see the writing is on the wall? Don't you... Don't you love me? Don't you want to start a new life together? Good. This way you know which way to go when the bus comes. It's simple, baby. Just do the right thing. [cricket chirping] [metal thuds] [Cookie] I'm not good at writing shit. So, I'll keep it quick. I have a heavy heart. I'm so ashamed of myself. I'm ashamed because I knew you was gonna get hurt if I told you where Winky was at. I didn't wanna tell you but... when J-Bird and I found you, you were so fucked up, and I kept thinking, "Cookie, you shouldn't have said shit. You shouldn't have told him, but I'm a dumb fucking hoe." Joan says I'll never learn. Dare, I never saw myself as a low-life and I swear, believe it or not, I think I'm definitely going back to school. I love you. And thank God you're in my life. Love. Cookie. You ready? You? Seat-belt. [seat-belt alarm softly ringing] [alarm stops] [narrator] He missed Cookie. He felt bad about always being tough on her. He thought back to those gaudy little outfits she wore, silly cheap jewelry, her child-like manner. Made him sad. He wanted to go back and save her in those eventide memories. Cookie strolling the city, lonely and lost. But she's not there anymore. And even the streets knew it. He's leaving Los Angeles. Taking a trip like Cookie and Joan did. Except not coming back. There were good cops here. Cops who cared. He could see that now. It was time to move on. He was going to the club tonight to propose. Hopefully, Violet would accept, and they'd all start a new life together somewhere far far away. I love you, Dare. I love you too. [man] I saw you do this once, what you did... I really want to see it. It's beautiful. - [Hope] It was a pleasure. - [man] Thank you. [Hope] I'm glad you came in. Thanks. [man 2] My country music is very important. - [Hope] Where you from? - [man 2] Peru. My father used to play charango. You know this word? No, I don't think I know that. [man 2] It's a small guitar... Made out of wood, armadillo, then strings - You're very beautiful. - [Hope] Thank you. - [Hope chuckles shyly] - My father used to teach me and my sisters how to play when we were young. He teach you how to kill cops too, Winky? Dare! Oh, my God! What are you doing? - Dare. - Hang tight, buddy. I got this. Hope, step aside. [yells] Move, Hope! [Hope wails] You in the booth, put your hands above your head and step out. One false move, I will spend every round in this gun on the back of your skull, and you better believe I'm a fucking sniper at five feet. That's right. Oh, look who it is.
