See you tomorrow. See you later. Ian, where's your hat? I have none. Put it on. Road's alright? A little icy, but not too bad. That left wiper, it's thicken again. You had two form for me, I'll get to it. Hey, are you taking that hockey shift for me on Tuesday? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. If you're going out tonight, better bring a log. The radio says it's gonna be 10 below. Yeah, global warming. Where is it, when you need it? Hey, Rich. Can I talk to you for a second? You never want to stop and chop with cutting wood. I could have been half way down the road - This will only take a minute. - You're the boss, boss. Rich... You know, the, uh, no deal feel through? What are you talking about? Would have been in the newspapers? I know they're making no announcements until the horse shit litigation's been worked out. I talked to Reggie-named guy yesterday. - What did they say? - Nothing. They don't have to. That's 60 percent of our contracts right there. They say in four, five weeks, everybody go home, they searched, scrapping out the place. Just keep it to yourself for now. I got to come up with a plan before telling the fellas. - Hey, Marla. - Hey, what? What is up? Hey, Marla, do you wanna drive down to that new place in Vangor? We got a DJ, strobe lights. Fun. Just dying to have you grind your boner into me. Why? Are you not going out tonight? I don't know, I might go up the hill. It's like I have something. No excuses. I'm a good dancer, you'll be surprised. This one is sweet and sour chicken and one crab for you. Right, you like crab. I mean, always the crab. Hey, Paula. Hey, Paula. How do you feel about being named after a one hit wonder? Um, what do you mean? "Hey Paula", you never heard that song? That'll be pretty memorable, I mean. It's annoying and I guess it named after you, right? Oh. - You guys need anything? - No, we're good. Brent, can I interest you to get some raffle tickets? Two for $1. Yeah, for the school band. Well, if I had any dollars, I'd probably won't spend them on a raffle tickets anyways. - But, uh... - No. Hey, do you still got that thing I gave you? Uh, that's... Maybe it's worth something. I don't know, you know. Hey... - Wow. - I knew you'll love it. Um, I got it in a machine I rent over the house. Well, I think it's worth at least 5 cent. - Oh, totally. - Yeah. I can give you a whole little piece of the raffle ticket. I would love one. Yeah. I'm about to start dinner, you wanna come down and help me set the table? Yeah, okay, I'm just practicing. I'll be down a minute. Okay, well, your dad will be home real soon. Okay. Is he gonna be home on time? Just come down soon okay. Hey, Pops. Oh... Here you go. - Hey. - Hey. Smell the cold in there. Dinner is ready in a second, okay? Come on, Luke. We should really get rid of that tree. In a couple of weeks. It started shedding the carpet. Is something wrong with that? No, it's fine. - Quit playing with that. - I kind of ate early. That's good. You mean while I was cooking, didn't you? It's okay. It's okay. Just put it on the counter next to the sink. I'll wrap it up for you later. What are you laughing at? Well, you're such a romantic. Relax. Fuck. Let me check. Get out of here. Well, come on. Are you gonna swim there by yourself now? Good morning. - You're leaving early? - Yup. You're wearing make up. What? I always wear it. You want a ride? Kim's on her way to pick me up. Well, you used to love it when I ride you to school when you are little. Oh, you used to beg me to send you to school. Good morning, Bill. Owen? Marla. Marla? Marla. Where have you been? I've been calling all morning. Mom, it's freezing out there. What's wrong? You were supposed to be there for her. You're supposed to be in that bus stop. You never said yesterday, I was... Yes, I did. Every other Tuesday. We agreed, Marla. We agreed. I can't keep tracking on our little thing, okay? You know all the shits been going on in my life. Why don't you remind me? - Why didn't you call me? - I did call you. You did? - You called my cell? - It's turned off. You said you were with Owen. I left a message over the house phone. I don't understand you. He is your son. Don't you realize that? Here you go. Would you like some more? No, thanks, I'm fine. Okay. So how long have you been, uh, driving a bus, Mrs. Dier? Oh, well, I got hired, uh, right after my daughter started school. So about 12 years. Why did you, uh, decide on this line of work? Uh, well, my father used to drive a truck for the mill. And I guess I thought it would be more fun than, uh, working a registrar. And, uh, um, work is easy and, uh, the hours aren't too bad. And I've always loved the kids. Isn't it normal procedure to check that the bus is empty before you lock it up? Yes. I was distracted I guess. Lesley, could you just walk me through what happened this morning? Um... I can be in French class right. Do you miss it? No, I hate French. It's so peaceful out here. Hmm. I really like it. Do you wanna keep going? - Yeah. Yeah. - Definitely. Hello. No, she can't come to the phone right now. No. No. You have to call back another time. That's right. Thank you. Is he gonna be okay? I don't know. The police said he was still unconscious when they get to the hospital. When did you talk to the police? There were, uh, reports and things that she didn't filled up since that accident. So it's mom's fault. Sometimes things just happen. Nothing you can do about it. What's gonna happen to her? She's gonna have to seek some time off. At least until they figure things out. She just need some time to rest. Now he's breathing on his own which is a good sign. We did some scans and the MRI and the EEG showed an encouraging amount of brain activity. Now, that's said, he's still not able to listen in any kind of conscious response. What does that mean? All that is, what we cal profoundly hypothermic. Basically, once the body gets below a certain temperature and goes into a kind of suspended animation. So it's system is completely shutdown. What we are doing right now is bring his body temperature back up to normal. You see, that way, we'll know the extent of the damage. Are you awake? I thought you'd might be hungry. You made this? Oh. So now you have no work? - I don't know. - I'm sorry. But now, with these new contracts nothing I can do about it. Where's Paula? She went to school already, I told her to let you be. Hey, what happened to you yesterday? I did cover for you then I heard something. All right, well, I guess we'll catch up later. A couple of trucks. - How many in? - Yeah. Fuck them up, that second pile. How is she doing? Kid is in the ICU right at Main Med. Some kind of coma. Do you want to head out a little early? I'll gas up that crane, bring out there. I can handle that. I'll pull one of the guys off to limber down there. Reading new contracts, aren't we? As long as we begin a few extra logs. Are they coming over? Yeah. So she's not coming here? I don't know. She's in Florida. Wow. Your family are real supportive people. They are your family too. I'm gonna go and get some air. - You want anything? - No. I'm fine. Miss Westbrook? Can I talk to you for a second? - Are you a doctor? - No. - Are you a cop? - No, no. Nothing like it. I'm actually here visiting another patient. I'm here to ask after your son. Can I help you? Uh, I'm not sure. I'm just having a word with Miss Westbrook. I'm Miss Westbrook. Oh, um. Are you the boy's mom? I'm his grandmother. What is this about? - Are you from the paper? - No, ma'am. My name Fred Lyman. Yours? My name is Crystal. Well, uh, okay. Miss Westbrook, I... I understand how you must be feeling. It's just an awful time. But I think mine running into here is a sign. I think I can help you bring some sense of resolution to this, and maybe, God willing, make it sort of never happens again to anyone. You're a lawyer? Yes, ma'am. I am an attorney. Do you want me to help you cut? Well, that's fine. You know, the water is boiling already. It's fine. Do you have that cutting board over here? Are you sure you don't want to turn off the water? Mom? Mom? Mom? Did you cut yourself? I'll get you a Band-Aid. It's all right. Hey. It will all be okay. - Do you want this one? - I'm sorry. Thanks, hon. It's fine. It's just a tiny cut. I'm okay. You don't have to be doing this. No, I want to. Really, I do. Uh, supper's gonna be ready. Um, it's almost ready. Go on. Go on. I'm fine. All right. Okay. Go upstairs and wait for dinner. How long do we have to stay here like this? I don't know. As long as it takes. It's been two days. Nothing has changed. He's not getting better. You heard what the doctor said. I'm calling the lawyer. Marla. That woman needs to pay for what she did. Revenge won't do anything to help. You know that. What about the money? What about that? What if he's like this forever? Who's gonna pay for that? You really want to take this to court? I've been there. They'll dig up your life and put out every last detail for examination. You want people asking more questions? Are you ready to tell them where you really were that day? If he's my son, then it's my choice. You sure you want to do this? Of course. Because I can just bring him myself. She'd understand. I already promised. Do you hear that? Yeah. Gutters are full of ice. They come loose. The house is falling apart. Huh. - Hey. - Hey. Look at that. They still got it. First year champs, 1980. Why are you here? Um, my niece plays the trombone. I like the trombone. She must have really long arms. I haven't seen you for awhile. Yeah, well... - How are you? - I'm good. I guess. How are you? I missed you. What's wrong with me? Wrong? No. Why would it be wrong? I don't know. I can't help it. Dad... Lesley, remember Charlotte? One of the nurses from where they took your dad. Oh, yeah. Of course. Nice to see you again. Uh, there you go. Yeah. All right. We got to go. Bye. - Good run in to you. - Bye. It's freezing. This space here is turning to shit. I have extension cord right at my mom's house. It's probably 30 of them tied together. Crafty. Hmm. Did you just want to lead or you're actually a good dancer? I fucking told you. I must dive a cliff to kill us. Well, you could be injured. You want a beer or something? Sure. Tush. I guess it got shook up earlier. He always says, "Is there juice boxes around?" when he comes and visits. I find him in the weirdest places like the back of the toilet. My mom buys him both for my desk, you know. - Who? - Owen, my kid. Oh. I had him when I was 17. Because my mom was really religious. I had a scholarship to U Maine. For music... It wasn't for a lot but they okay me for a program. Yeah, my brother said, uh, a Jesus stuff like this. Bullshit. Well, it keeps my mom from freaking out. A lot of bad shit happened in her life. - What's all these? - I'll get rid of it all. There's too much old stuff in this house. We'll have a yard sale or something. Did you clean your room? What are you doing? Adjust these new wires. One, two... Hey, Marla. You must have gone out already. I just wanted to make sure Owen's got there alright and he has his medicine with him. I hope you two are having a good time. Tell him I love him and I will see him tomorrow. I love you. Message deleted. Is my hair bothering you? Uh, no. It's okay. You should go through some of those bags over there. Some of that stuff, see if you want it, because I'm gonna get rid of it all. Okay. You mind getting her for us? Miss Dier? Can I help you? There's a few things we need to sort out. Unfortunately, we got to do it down the statio. What happened? Yeah, I pulled back too soon. Half of these are fucked. I guess I'm gonna have to go back to the garage. Yeah, I know. To have a fucking day shot. So lend me an access to the medical records. Everything. I'm gonna need you to sign the... representation, engagement letter. It's nothing more than just giving me the right to speak on your behalf. It's not a financial agreement or anything. Okay? So, Marla... Marla, listen up. This is important. I don't want you to talk to any. Especially the insurance companies, okay? Have you not heard? That dad gets mom. I mean, shouldn't she be out like holding a candlelight vigil or something. It's not that. The law defines criminal neglige as the, uh, failure to foresee and allow avoidable dangers. And the standard we apply is the standard of a reasonable person in similar circumstances. In other words, would someone with a training of a bus driver have allowed this to happen? And the findings of this D.A.'s office... Here. Was no. A reasonable person would not. On to your left, please. Ugh, how are you doing? I'll be doing a hell lot better if one of those beers are for m. I'm your friend, remember? Listen, Rich. This is just between you and me for now. I'm actually thinking about liquidating. Once the season is over, selling olf the machines, trucks, everything. I've been asking around, I got a pretty good price on that scooter. It was Reggie who gave me good lead on this construction thing down sub. Great. Didn't you just get finish telling how you are my friend? Hey. I tried to make it work. Not more than just tried up, just by killing myself. Can't make it without them mill contracts, there is just no way. You killed yourself. What do you think I've been doing for the last 25 years? I know. You did. I'm sorry. I wish you were different. Yes, I'm sorry about all this really lame CDs They are my gramps. I kind of like them. It taste really awful. Coffee-Brandy. I call it bitch whiskey. My grandma loves it. We'll see how. Do you ever worry about you feeling like... Turning to your parents? What do you mean, like, become a total bad beat? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I heard what happened with that kid and everything. There are some teachers talking about him, so... Yeah. You know, she used to drive me and my brother. Your mom did. You know, I was always being obnoxious, throwing shit. I mean, leaving garbage under the seat. She guessed so fast. I don't blame her, I mean, she was a total nice lady and I was just giving her a hard time. What is this? What are you watching? I'm not sure. You're up late. Is Paula here? No. I don't know. What's wrong? What happened? I don't know. I want you to talk to me. Please. I can't. What's wrong? What? I don't have anything. It's okay. No? Yeah. Hey. - Where have you been? - Work. Bullshit. It's almost midnight. I decided to go out after. It doesn't matter anyway. I qui. You quit? Who do you think you are? You come walking here anytime you want like there are no rules, and you say you decided to quit? - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? Why don't you look at yourself for once? You have barely even been here. What are you out there doing anyway? What, do you think we're stupid? You have only been thinking about yourself, you don't think that anybody... Hey, I'm out there trying to keep this house from being taken away from us. I'm paying for the food you won't even eat. Now, it looks like I'm the only one working at all. Yeah, and I bet you think that's mom's fault, don't you? Like it's her fault that she lost her job? I never said that. You don't have to say anything. You think it's mom's fault that their kid's gonna die Don't you? Mom. I'm gonna make everything okay. I promise. Lesley? Hey, that's something. Not so. Do you get the, uh... Hey. What are you doing? What do you mean? Nothing. I don't know. Um, I want to ask you something. Yeah? Uh, I was thinking... If you're cool with it, maybe I could stay with you for a few days. Just sit down at my house for a little while. Um, I don't know. I don't think it's such a good idea. My granny has been really pissed off lately at me. He found out I finished the brandy so... Yeah. I don't know. I don't think she'd go for that. Okay. How did you know where I live? This was my route. I stop here everyday. What do you want? I have a daughter. Her name is Paula. Uh, she's 17 now. She's a junior down at the high school here. And, uh, a long time ago, when she was 5, my husband, he's a big ice fisherman here. He goes all the time. And, um, one weekend, we went with him, because it was supposed to be the last good weekend for it because it was getting warm her. And I remember I was watching the sun go down, and I had to turn my back for... Just a few seconds. And all of a sudden, I hear people screaming. Because the ice was thinner than we'd thought. And by the time I got to her, her lips were blue. And she wasn't moving. And for a minute, she was gone. And I swore to myself that I would never ever turn my back, ever again. I'm very sorry. Owen was with his grandmother most of the time. My mom, Crystal, she's a good lady. She's got a good heart. She knows how I am. I mean, she was just like me. You want to know the fucked up thing? I don't even think about him all that much. I just got all these other shit in my head, you know. I just want to be like a real person. But you loved him. I know you do. You don't know that. You don't know that. You don't know me at all. I shouldn't be even talking to you. Why not? Why can't we talk? I got a lawyer. We can take you for all you got. But I don't even have anything. I got nothing... You got more than me. What do I have? Look. I got nothing. You've got things. There are people who care about you. What do you think coming here was gonna do? You think you can just come in and you didn't mean to fucked u? - And you told him to get bette. - No. It's not gonna fucking get him better. I don't know. He's not getting better. He's just gonna die. Or we're both gonna have to deal with it. What the fuck are you doing? Where's your fucking mind, man? You're gonna fucking kill somebody out here. Hasn't your fucking family put enough people in the goddamn hospital, huh? Your mother was in an accident. Where is she? - Is she okay? - I don't know. She wasn't on the car when they found it. What do you mean? No. The car was not badly wrecked. So I have to... If she was injured, she might gone off to get help or someone stopped by and picked her up. It's coming down pretty hard out there so, uh, anything could happen. I'll get everybody out there on alert but the roads are a mess. So we may just have to wait. Where are you going? I can't just sit here. I'll go out and look. What am I supposed to do? Someone has to be here if she come home. Or if the phone rings. I don't want to be alone. It's okay. I got it for him. You shouldn't have been here. Yeah. I know. No, I mean tonight. Something happened. He moved. What do you mean? During the test. His hand moved. Just a little. But he was... Reacting to touch. He was reacting to pressure on his fingers. But the doctors said not to get our hopes up. That may not mean anything. When? When did that happen? A little while ago. An hour ago. But I missed it. I wasn't here. You're here now. Hello? Lesley? Are you all right? Please tell me you're okay. I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah. I was looking for you everywher. You didn't call me. Let me know you're okay. I couldn't. I can't go on like this. Lesley... Yeah? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry too.
