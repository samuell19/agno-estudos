'On the evening of 8th November...' '...the Indian government took a historical decision of demonetization.' 'And with this decision...' '...the entire nation has openly declared war on black-money.' 'According to some speculations because of demonetization...' '...more than 4000 billion black-money will be out of the system'. 'Today the poor and the honest people of the country are happy...' '...whereas those who accumulated black-money are mourning.' 'Another question which is still lurking in everyone's mind...' '...is what about the black-money hidden overseas.' 'According to Bank of Italy's senior economist...' '...more than 181 billion dollar of India's wealth is hidden in banks overseas.' 'If all of this money can be brought back, then...' '...1.5 million can actually be credited in every poor Indian's account.' 'Or all the essential infrastructure projects...' '...like roads, electricity, bridges, rail and dams can be completed before time.' 'Every year more than 4000 Indian farmers commit suicide...' '...due to draught, loan or crop damage.' 'If the black-money hidden overseas can be brought back...' '...then no farmer will ever have to commit suicide.' 'But is such a thing really possible in our country?' Reza...there's bad news for you. You are going to be encountered. - Encounter? Get out of there immediately... you don't have much time. But who will encounter your men? - Don't know. It's someone from outside the system. We don't have any information about him. Now...get out! Bala...get up. Time for action. This place is like a fort. Look at all the guards. Just be there on time. I'll say just two words... ...and you will tell me the rest of the story. Vicky Chaddha. He's the biggest agent... ...who launders money of all the bigwigs of India. But you won't be able to catch him. Because Vicky Chaddha fled to Malaysia today. Bala...Vicky Chaddha fled to Malaysia. Now...draw your gun. - But...But I told you everything. Bala... fire two bullets... - Hey... At Me... What do you mean? First bullet here, in the leg anywhere. But, avoid the femoral artery. Or else I will bleed to death on the way. - What are you saying? second bullet here, on the side of the liver. Exactly here. Have you lost your mind? No, It's not me, it's the system. I came all the way to Taiwan for you... ...yet, I will have to prove that the encounter was genuine. But why do you want to encounter me? - Bala ready? You're not a cardboard cutout Karan. There are no dots on you. - Then Imagine it. Why do you want to get yourself killed? No one's so lucky to get shot in the exact place and survive. Bala, shoot! Shoot! I told you...don't do it. No need to be so happy... your turn will also come. - Me...me... Why me? What is he saying? What is he saying? Bala, liver... - No-no-no... Really?.. What's going on? Now the court will believe, that... ...you snatched the gun from Bala's hand and shot me. Goodbye, Reza. Bala...place your gun in his hands. But he told you everything, so why did we kill him? He wasn't going to do any good staying alive. Good morning sir - Good morning. Sir... Does your parents know that their son... ...who used to be a normal person, is doing such tricks now. Sir, they know...that our life is always infested by danger. I see... But do they know that their son can get himself shot... ...and only to prove in the court that it wasn't an encounter. I mean you've become a trigger-happy man, Karan. That's genuinely how it happened. Do you really think that I am that stupid? I should've let you be a Commando. Bringing you in the Special Cell was a mistake. Sir, I am a Commando... ...and will always be one. Changing uniforms doesn't change my duties. Okay... So...when are you coming back to office? Well Reza's information came in handy. Our two-year long mission is finally completed. Vicky Chaddha was arrested in Malaysia yesterday. If the prey is already in the net... ...then why call the hunter back? Because there's a twist in the story. Good morning sir... Good morning...Good morning... please sit down. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Bala...how are you? Please... Vicky Chaddha. - Which one? People say all of them. And this is the one who was recently apprehended. Vicky Chaddha keeps changing his faces. And we don't know whether the current face he has... ...is the real one or not. And that makes him more dangerous. He handles money for a lot of people of India... People who are quite powerful and control the entire system. And the worst thing is, we don't know who they are. Vicky Chaddha is the biggest part of this network. He is the one who controls the entire network. But sir, you haven't told me the twist in the story yet. Only the Special Cell knows about his arrest. And it's a ticking time-bomb. We must first tap the phones of all the power-brokers in Delhi. After that we must publicize the news of Vicky Chaddha's arrest in the media. When this news turns into a sensation... ...they will definitely react. And all we need is a single mistake. The Malaysian Police apprehended Vicky Chaddha... ...along with his wife Maria in Kuala Lumpur. This is believed to be a big achievement... ...in the government's efforts to bring the black-money money back. The question still lingers whether the government will stop at Vicky Chaddha? Or will they apprehend the benefactors of Vicky Chaddha. According to sources Vicky Chaddha has been laundering ... ...more than 1000 billion rupees, plundered from the country... ...in overseas banks. Ma'am, can you please tell us... ...why it took you so long to apprehend Vicky Chaddha? Ma'am... Ma'am, the people of the nation are quite angry... They want answers! Please answer us. We can understand people's rage. We will bring Vicky Chaddha back soon. And also apprehended those who are associated with him. The day isn't far, when the money plundered from every poor Indian... ...will be credited back to his account. That's our promise. What's wrong, Mr. Runwal? Dishank, what are you mother-son up to? I've heard that your mother... ...is going to deposit our money in the accounts of the people. Mr. Runwal, you know one has to say these things. She is the Home Minister. Everyone contributed in this because of their faith in me and Kamath. Mr. Runwal, it's not just your and your people's money he has. He has my money too. Nothing's going to happen. Mom knows that if I get involved... ...then the government can crumble down. Please...relax. Mom... Mom, if Vicky Chaddha returns safely... ...and exposes everyone, then either I'll have to shoot myself... ...or these people will kill me. You've succeeded in doing what the opposition couldn't do all these years. You made me lose. Mom...no...mom Leave.. - But mom... Just leave, Dishank. There's... There's a big problem. Why aren't we getting any definite report... ...about the situation in Malaysia? the paperwork for bringing Vicky Chaddha back is in process. And the Malaysian government has given us permission... ...to shift him to a safe-house. Let's not forget that we've made a big promise to the people. It's the question of their faith. Our priority isn't just bringing Vicky Chaddha back... ...but also finding the money. Otherwise people will lose faith in us. Leela... Yes, of course...of course. It's just like we suspected. Some brokers, politicians and businessmen... ...have completely switched to silent-mode. Now they will meet face-to-face... ...and hatch a plan to get out of this situation. But...there must be numerous places where they can meet... - Exactly sir! And that's why we will keep an eye... ...on every party, every five-star hotel, every wedding... ...and all those places where such deals are done, and will wait for them. Bala, I want their room numbers. - Let me check. Yes, Karan. Home Minister Leela Chaudhary has just reached Hotel Park International. Her son is there too. What does that prove? Well, we've got some interesting footage. Take a look. Sir Home Minister's son Dishank is meeting them. But Karan...these are all very powerful people. And it's really a big risk for you. I've never enjoyed taking small risks, sir. Karan, just got the message. Presidential Suite...650. Just before his arrest, Vicky has transferred all our money... ...the entire 1000 billion rupees to some unknown account. And he has neither left any paper trail nor electronic. All the details are inside his head. And that is why killing him will be stupidity. and anyways my mom's going to send a team of handpicked officers... ...to bring him back. Dishank, we want to meet your mom... as soon as possible. Let us know her plan. We need to know who all are there in her team... Mr. Runwal ... - who are bringing Vicky back. Mr. Runwal, don't worry. Please...please don't worry. That team will consist of people vetted by us. Vicky Chaddha may try to escape on the way... ...or maybe someone might come to his rescue. Or even kill him. And that's why we're sending our best team. Our team is being headed by ACP Bakhtawar. Sir, the crowd is growing big. Shall I order for baton charge! no...it's a peaceful protest. We cannot use force on them. There's not much difference between a police dog... ...a horse drawing a cart and the politician's favorite Bakhtawar. He will return only after fulfilling the order given to him. Yes... Yes, ma'am. You have only 30 minutes, Bakhtawar. Clear the road. - Sure, ma'am. Bhavna Reddy, our encounter specialist. She's more of a 'gun-for-hire'. Give her information and money... ...and she will kill any gangster. No... Good bye. Shetty's name's been scratched off too. Gabbar Gang, Total finished. English and imported items both are her weakness. There's a rumor in the police circle... ...that she killed gangster Lal Singh just for a Gucci bag. She aims to be as rich as the poverty she has seen. Our Cyber Cell's most talented officer. Zafar Hussain. You have only 60 seconds... to hack these terrorist accounts. 30... 10... Five... - No! Four... Three... - No-no-no... Two... One... Not bad. Welcome to the force. 60 seconds! Wow! That's impressive. Wasn't your record in system's hacking 90 seconds? ...he's cleverer than you. But he's never held a gun. This man should've been on Facebook staff. Not in this team. And Sharad Pandey. I've seen him with you. Thank you. He's the sycophant-in-chief. He will be madam's eyes and ears on this team. They have chosen such a pathetic team... ...their intentions can't be good. The team is good, madam. But we want to know your plan. They will bring Vicky Chaddha to India... ...and will take him straight to Tihar. He'll be kept in solitary confinement in Tihar. Officers chosen by the Home Minister... ...will make him spill the beans about the money. And will they only kill him? Since I am the Home Minister, my plan is slightly better. There will be a riot in jail, Vicky will get hurt... ...and on the way to the hospital he'll... Now I must come out in the open. It's time to infiltrate the team. You got the team you wanted. No more charades now. Don't let those jokers anywhere near Vicky. Just bring him back to India. There is no room for mistakes, Bakhtawar. Consider it done, ma'am. And anyway, Bakhtawar has never failed to carry out any orders. Hello, sir. Zafar. - I know. It seems Ma'am misunderstood the word undercover as without cover. Why hasn't Pandey reached yet? Why scared? My name's Bhavna Reddy. You Jafar. - Z-Zafar.. Yeah... Jafar. Computer man. - Yeah... In police? Police don't need computer, they need gun. Why you? A... actually, in today's world... - Do you know better, or do I? Forget it. Everyone is saying that I am looking super-stylish today. Sir! - Sir! It's boarding time already and Pandey hasn't reached. Am I on time? I am Karan... - Pandey. Karan Pandey. You're 52 years old. I read it in your report. You've really maintained yourself very well. Pandey didn't maintain himself... he's got a stroke. And I am taking his place. You will slip on this soap... ...and hit your head on that, and you'll be dead. I've 50 ways to kill you between here and the airport, making it look like an accident ...and no one will know. You're going to the hospital and not the airport. And what if I agree? You'll say that you've got a stroke. We've made all the preparations in the hospital. Pandey, what's wrong? Say something, Pandey! Like I said, ma'am, it's a stroke. How can he speak? Suddenly? - It happens suddenly, ma'am. Can happen to anyone. You guys take so much stress. Even you... Doctor, will I be fine? We're all cooperating. If you will also cooperate, then maybe... I didn't know that Karan will turn out to be such a rascal. These are my papers. Do you know who I am? This is my first time going out of country. I've packed some really fashionable and stylish looking clothes. They will look amazing on foreign locations. What are you going to buy from foreign? - What? I mean Armani perfume, Apple phone, Ray Ban sunglasses, Rolex watch... We're not going there for shopping. These white-collar criminals are such pushovers. You don't need to be stressed about bringing them back. Take a flight...apprehend him... ...catch a flight again. What else will one do in-between? Shopping. - Shopping. Ma'am, there's some Karan here instead of Pandey... Pandey's got a stroke...suddenly! And the Special Cell recommended his name almost immediately. He was a commando with the 9 Para-troopers. He was court-martialed... for killing civilians in broad-daylight. Doesn't believe in rules. He's dangerous...keep an eye on him. Finally I am here... on foreign soil. Everything's so nice here. Even the airport flooring is way more beautiful... ...than the one's in Jaya Aunt's home. These guys are way ahead in cleanliness as well. Hello...How nice! Can I click a photo of your daughter? - No! Shut up! Sweetheart, smile...say cheese. Evidence of foreign holidays is 101% compulsory. - Yes! Hi, I am Shrinath Iyer... - Hi. From the Indian Embassy. Hi, ACP Bakhtawar Khan and this is my team. Zafar. Mr. Iyer, is there a shopping mall close to the airport? - No! We'll go straight to the safe-house. Okay. This place is littered with roads. And that too so clean. White-washed. Clean pollution. Mr. Iyer, can we stop please. We can click few pictures in outdoor locations What to do? My brother Raju has been insisting on Whatsapp. Okay... Mr. Iyer, please handover Vicky's phone and laptop to Zafar. Sure. Zafar, Bhavna...and everybody. We'll only record statements of Vicky and his wife. We don't have the power to interrogate them. I'll give that Chaddha one tight hug... Your hands and feet are slaves to my orders. My hands and feet don't even obey my order But you can always try. Ma'am, Karan's going to be a problem. If he interferes in your job, then shoot him. I will handle everything back here. Yes...go. Go for the kill... Go for the kill... Go-go-go...just kill it! Hey, guys. Seriously, you guys are showing such attitude... ...as if you've surrounded the ISIS chief. But trust me, when you will find out the truth... ...you won't stop laughing, just like... Sorry. So sorry... My love. She's hot, isn't she? I know. Maria. ACP Bakhtawar Khan. We assure you, if you'll cooperate... ...we will behave in a very civilized manner with you. We also assure you, our full cooperation officer. Maria... - A...A... Waste fellow. It's really hard for him to speak. He only ever spoke to spectacled girls all his life. Myself Reddy... - Hi. Bhavna Reddy. Inspector. Encounter Inspector. Your lipstick's shade is really stylish. Where did you buy it from? - Thank you, inspector. I really don't remember. I didn't get your name. - I didn't give it. Vicky, your medicines are right there... ...but you will never take them on your own. No one can imagine. That he's such a dangerous criminal? - No. That he has such a hot wife. I am alive because of her. And she only has kept me alive. Enough praising me, now come on...take it. If you are done with your romantic episode... ...then, can we get back to work? Ohh man..I am scared... ..my hands are trembling. Listen... Listen you holier-than-thou piece of sh** I'm just a rumor... ...spread by the corrupt and rascal politicians of my country. Black-money is equal to Vicky Chaddha. Chapter over! They were looking for a scapegoat... ...and they chose me. Don't you get that, dammit. I haven't done anything. Vicky. Calm down. Don't trust him. After the demonetization it's even more important... ... that you bring Vicky Chaddha back to India . If anything happens to him out there... ...then his people here will go berserk. It will be a war. Yeah. Bring him back to India safely. What do you guys think? According to me. Vicky is smarter than you think. So stop racking your brains. Just follow the orders. I saw, you were completely mesmerized seeing his wife. Ladies and Police instinct. Correct? Tell me. Zafar. Mr. Iyer gave you Vicky's laptop, didn't he? Yes... So let's get some work done. It's completely clean. He's erased everything... ...and rebooted the system. Vicky Chaddha should've been in the Cyber Cell. He's definitely planning something, Zafar. What's brewing in your mind, Vicky Chaddha? Mr. Iyer. - There's a problem, Mr. Bakhtawar. The police arrested four sharpshooters entering in Malaysia. Dubai connection. This can't be a coincidence. I feel they will either attack Vicky or us. Zafar... ...if you were so interested in computers... ...then why didn't you join IT? Why did you become a police officer? You must have heard my name properly. Zafar Hussain. Owing to my name, how many people do you think... ...Would believe that I am a patriot? This fact...really hurt me. And I decided to do something for the country. Even give up my life if I have to. Whether it'll be the police, army...or anything. But it's not my fault that... ...God gave me more brains than brawns. But no matter what you say, sir... ....I am still a police officer. - Absolutely. Your choice maybe different... But serving the country... ...is much more fun than anything else. You say such meaningful things, Commando... ...I am sure you hit just as hard. Let there be a fight, and I'll show you what I've got. Well, I'll see you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. The moment I entered, he left. I guess he's scared of me. Tomorrow morning at 9am... ...we will be taken back to India. If they take us to India tomorrow... We will never be able to avenge Tara again. Karan, we've conclusive information... As soon as Vicky arrives in Tihar Jail... ...they will get the Information on the money and then kill him. Sir, Vicky won't make it to India. As soon as everyone falls asleep... ...I will sneak into his room and get all the information. Those rascals won't get anything. I'll call you back, sir. Excuse me... - Vicky's sleeping. You didn't come here to tuck me in. You speak well. Well you inspire me to. You're smart as well. If you keep staring like this... ...then I won't be able to think anymore. And you've this unique stare... Because you look so amazing. You thought this is why I came here, right? I admit...it's not easy to resist you. But I madly love that guy on the wheelchair who's my husband. Away from the hustle-bustle of the city of Dubai... ...we had a home in a very serene locality. Vicky, me and Tara were quite happy. Vicky was leading a good and honest life. He was a successful banker with a leading banking corporation. He was handling the top clients from all over the world. Someone introduced him to some Indian politicians and businessman... ...in an Indian Embassy party. Next day they invited Vicky for lunch. And offered him to launder their black-money at 10% commission. When Vicky refused, they threatened him... ...that they will kill his old parents who live in India. And one day his father, who went out for his morning walk... ...suddenly disappeared. They said that his mother, me and his daughter will meet the same fate. That's when Vicky apologized and agreed. While back in India they started making a police record of Vicky. They turned Vicky into a monster in those files. His many faces... the disappearing into thin air... They turned him into a myth. One day he said... That's enough, Maria. I want to tell the authorities everything. How long will I keep plundering my own country? I supported him. He contacted the Finance Ministry. But the very next day. Nothing was more important than her, officer. Tara was the light of our eyes... ...and we lost her. But miraculously Vicky survived. I kept blaming myself, but Vicky said... I got what I deserved, but now... ...I am going to return this money to our people, not them. We've to take revenge from those who killed our daughter. Please, Karan. Help us get our revenge. Why should I believe you? You can check all the past records. And after this... I promise I will convince Vicky to tell you everything. Their names...evidences of their crime. Even the whereabouts of the money. Please help us. And what do you want in exchange? Two things. First, you will get all those rascals behind bars. And secondly, our safety... Get us to Thailand border... We've relatives in Bangkok. And we don't have any criminal record there. We can start a new life out there. And I should believe you? - Yes, Karan. Because I am prepared to do anything... ...to save Vicky and avenge Tara's death. Even though I love my husband... ...I can go a lot further than this. Dubai's employment details, civil court records, marriage registry... ...birth and death records. Everything she said is true, Commando. They had a four year old daughter. We're changing route. Now you'll be taking a boat, and... ...get off at a port which is 50 kilometers from Malaysia-Thailand border. My team will receive you there, and take you to a private airfield. From where you will fly back to India in a chartered flight. Are there duty-free shops at private airfields? I am sure he knows. I am waiting for your affirmation. You'll be making a big mistake if you listen to her. Why should I take you to Bangkok? You've no interest in me, right? But what about the money looted from millions of Indians. Don't test my patience... go straight for the kill. Come on...get me excited. The biggest mall of Bangkok in Thailand Terminal 21. I need a key from the mall's locker no. 307. That key opens the locker in my bank. Once I've the money, I will do as you say. Now this is getting boring. Fine, call up Terminal 21's locker room. Ask them whom does locker no. 307 belongs to. And then call the National Bank of Bangkok. To confirm whether I have an account with them or not. Vicky. Is everyone okay? We need to talk. We need to head to a different port... ...and not the one which Mr. Iyer mentioned. Karan, I knew you were crazy... ...but, I didn't know you were completely insane. There's no point in taking Vicky to Tihar and getting him killed, Bakhtawar. It's much better if we take him to Bangkok. Commando, let's just do what we've been told, or else... Or else what? Keep following orders blindly? Then who's going to do the duty, Zafar? - You! You will do the duty. If I shoot you now, no one's going to ask me questions. - Sir-sir-sir... Don't test my patience... - Bakhtawar sir stop... It's hard to say whether he's telling the truth... ...or his ears are resonating with 'Maria-Maria' tone. We've been compromised! We can be attacked again. Don't you guys get that? How can all of us fit in this? - Let's see... Move-move... - Commando! Move... - What are you doing? This was just a warning shot, I won't miss next time. I am telling you last time You're making a big mistake. Sir... Get him bandaged. Commando! Mr. Iyer, listen carefully. Karan has eloped with Vicky. If you want to ask anything, you can. I only ask questions when I'm holding a gun. That's the only time when you get the right answers. This is the right thing, Bhavna. - Bhavna. Only time will tell whether your this decision is right or not. One more thing. In the morning when I saw you jogging... ...I felt for you. But 30 minutes back...that feeling died. Thank you for trusting us, Karan. There's a University up-ahead. Please stop there. Karan, you are very special. Come with me, life will be great. And what if I offer the same to you? Vicky. Come darling. Miracles don't happen without any divine intervention. That means he was fooling all of us. Leave... Leave I say. Let me go. Vicky isn't going anywhere. You can keep the body if you want. You don't understand girls too well. Actually I am Vicky Chaddha. You must be curious... ...about what that story was? The story was true. Just, that family belonged to some other Vicky Chaddha... ...who I got killed and took his place. But I owe you one... So stay alive...and stay happy. God bless. Goodbye. Unfortunately, I owe her nothing. Zafar, Zafar Karan has gone hostile. There's nothing we can do as long as Vicky is in Thailand. Iyer has been given orders... ...to arrest Karan at any cost. He would want to deal with us after he's been arrested. We'll also make a deal with him. You wanted to prove, didn't you Zafar. Well...you did. You gave your life. I kept telling you not to trust that lady. But you didn't listen. I don't get it. After years of secrecy... ...why did you tell him everything about who you are, and what... I mean what did you possibly see in him? You won't understand my equation with Karan. And anyway, the Vicky Chaddha he'll be looking for... ...won't exist from Monday. Tell Chang to admit to the University murders... ...and surrender with the weapons. Let's go to Terminal 21 fast. Karan will be right behind us in a fit of rage. Sir, Zafar's body is lying in the University. His body must be sent back to India, with full honors. Don't you talk to me about honor. This is all your fault. Just stay there and surrender. Let's go. You're talking about leaving your partner like this. We must stop Vicky Chaddha from reaching Terminal 21. And yes...I didn't do this for some medal... ...nor for a foreign trip. You can help me if you want to. Mom... What kind of a team did you send out there? Bunch of useless and... Let's not talk about who's useless and who's not! You had no clue that he isn't Vicky Chaddha at all. Look, madam... Will you let Zafar's death go in vain? Karan. If someone kills a police man... ...then, the police doesn't rest until he's dead. Game on Vicky Chaddha Mr. Iyer, I want a chopper. Karan wouldn't have gone too far. I'm going to send Karan's dead body along with Zafar's. Mr. Iyer, I want every police officer in and around Terminal 21... ...to have Karan and Bhavna's photographs. Welcome. KP, we'll take the back-exit instead of the main exit. Ok lets go. KP, did you call the boys? - Yes, madam. No guy ever follows any girl unless he's interested in her. It's hard to decide... ...Whether you start flirting when you sense danger... ...or your flirting invites danger? Yes, Iyer. Karan is in the airplane junkyard outside the mall. Okay. - Stay there and guide me. What's this? I got a little tied up... and you're already leaving. What are you looking at? Shoot the witch. She shot a police officer. Key... What will you do with the key? It only opens the locker in a bank which contains a bag... ...which has a laptop. And for which you'll need my retina scan and fingerprints.. And even if you get that, it's of no use to you. Because the password is up here. I had my intentions... but now you gave me an excuse as well. Now I'll also take the lady along with the key. Drop your weapons! Oh s*** Come-come-come. Get in the car, ma'am. We can decide on the percentage later. Don't think, ma'am. I'll tell you the reason myself. Serving your country isn't just boring... ...it also makes you pauper. I don't want a criminal record in Bangkok. Otherwise I would've never missed this opportunity to kill you. Do not move! How much money is on stake here, man? I must decide too... ...whether risking my life is worth it or not. People like Bakhtawar are turning bad... ...and I am originally the greedy kind. - Just shut up! Right...you didn't utter a word to the one you should. Arrest them! Mr. Iyer, why me? Have you ever heard anyone getting kidnapped and arrested for the same case? Silence is often a sign of danger, Bakhtawar. What danger, madam? I played all the right moves... ...so that I get to come on this trip. I went out so that Karan could talk to you on the boat. Otherwise you two couldn't have made your plan. He's a policeman, madam. Trusting him... You won't find anyone more loyal than a policeman ever. But once he turns corrupt... ...he'll stay that way for the rest of his life. What's your price? - 10... Nothing less than 10%, ma'am. Get Vicky arrested, Iyer. And as soon as you arrest her... ...shoot Karan and Bakhtawar. - Sorry, ma'am. Vicky doesn't have any criminal record in Thailand. We cannot arrest her in this country. What? She murdered two people at the University. One of them was her so-called husband. One of her men admitted to the murders... ...and surrendered with the murder weapon. We've no case. Talk to the Interpol and get a Red-Corner Notice issued. We've to be very careful. Indian government will approach Interpol. So from now on... use only local criminals for any job. What an idea? Poor Jafar is dead... and I'm in lockup. How did her goons get there? How did they know? - Are you crazy ? Even after losing you are not accepting your defeat... ...you're still going around in circles! Karan, tell me... I know I am little stupid. But why didn't you and Jafar check Vicky's story? Her story was correct. There was a man by that name and a family as well. Mr. Iyer, why did you lock me up with him? I was taken at gun-point. What's my fault? The inquiry commission back in India will decide... ...whether it was your fault or not. I see...and what about me? Delhi has already decided about you. Delhi is going to change its decision. Give me your phone and go out. - Why, What for? Your Leela madam must be in a bad temper right now. But she will calm down after talking to me. Iyer, please give me some good news. I can, ma'am...but I am not Iyer. Karan! Wow, you recognized me from my attitude. How did you get your hands on Iyer's phone? Did you kill him too? Bakhtawar thinks small. He must have demanded 10 percent from Vicky. I will take 20 from you... but I'll get the job done. Done. But I can't take chances. I'm going to offer 15 percent to Bakhtawar as well. And we'll see...who collects the commission. Him...or you. For now...please tell Mr. Iyer to give me a free-hand. Goodbye. Today is Saturday, bank will reopen on Monday. So we have only 48 hours to find her. How will we find her and where? Vicky sent a message to her men from the safe-house. Through someone. Mr. Iyer, how soon can we get all the CCTV footages of the safe-house? In order to find me, Karan will start looking from the same place... ...where we met for the first time. If he figures out my plan from there... ...then he'll be one step closer to me. And so we must stay one step ahead of him. Thank you so much for taking care of us. The food was amazing. Anyway...I don't have much. This is all I can give you. What a big miser this Vicky Chaddha is. She has millions of dollars in her Swiss bank account... ...and all she gave her poor cookie is that bible. Cookie? Was that her name? - No-no... Her name's Erica. But since she's a female cook, so cookie. There was nothing in it. It was just a normal Gideon's Bible. Hold on... Wait a second, Karan. What did you possibly find? All the information was in that Bible. And Erica delivered Vicky's all messages to her men. We can get Erica's address from the Embassy's records. The entire system was in Vicky's control. Otherwise Erica who lived in Bangkok... ...would've never got a job in the safe-house in malaysia. But what was so important in that Bible? - That's what we need to find out. Please hurry up. Bakhtawar. Vicky is cleverer than us. - But Bhavna Reddy isn't any less. I'll definitely find some proof here. The Bible isn't here. She delivered it somewhere. And also sent a record of the delivery. Her phone was lying under the sofa. Forward this clip to your mobile... ...and delete it from the phone. And leave the phone here for the police. How can you make the mistake of leaving the phone behind, KP? Why are you getting tensed? Even if the police find the phone, it won't prove anything. I mean...check this. His face is completely hidden in this clip. I hate mistakes, KP. So don't try and defend it. Erica's dead. This man's face isn't visible. Nor can we see where these two met. How will we find out who she gave the Bible to... ...and what was in it? Good news! The police recovered the phone, but there wasn't any clip in it. Erica had already deleted the clip. It's a dead end. It won't look clearer if he keeps playing it over-and-over again. Mr. Iyer, we need a hi-tech forensic lab. 5 bells...so it's 5pm. The place where they met is a church. There are 407 churches all over Bangkok. And all the churches ring their bells five times at 5 o'clock. So? Increase the mid-frequency from 1.5 to 3.5 khz, please. It's the horn of some small ship at a distance. It's somewhere close to the river. Don't try to impress us. The entire city is on the banks of a river. What nonsense. Now increase the higher-frequency from 6.0 to 10.5 khz. - Sure. Sound of birds chirping. So the church is on the banks of a river... ...and there's a bird-sanctuary nearby. Can I have the visual on the big screen? - Yeah, sure. Stop! Can you zoom into his hand? Can you clean this reflection? - Okay. This is the only church on the banks of a river... ...which has a bird-sanctuary nearby and a McDonalds opposite to it. Next time if you do anything like this... ...I am telling you I'll fall madly in love with you, and I'll kiss you on the lips... Take it as a warning or compliment... And secondly... Hey...bad manners, waste fellow... They chose a really good place. No one will raise an eyebrow... ...if you handover a Bible to someone outside the church. And smart too... The question is...what message did Vicky send through the bible. But the bigger question is... who is this guy? Jimmy. He's an Indian. He came here for some software contract. He's a popular hacker and a software developer as well. He works on contracts. He masks his IP and uses free wifi of the local cafes... ...so that he doesn't get caught. We must catch him. He's our last hope to catch Vicky. I can't leave Jimmy alone even for a second. Tail him. They won't leave Jimmy alone even for a second. But madam, he's a criminal. Tailing him could be risky. Whatever the risks maybe KP... ...but we must keep an eye on him. We want Jimmy alone... Only if we tail Jimmy, we'll know what he's up to. Mr. Iyer, we will have to create a diversion. Why to waste so much time? We'll pickup Jimmy and interrogate him... ...and he'll spill the beans. Mr. Iyer...Are you ready? Karan and Bhavna are being deported. Today. No-no...this is definitely a trap. Let's not trust them. Bakhtawar is right, this is definitely a trap. You two must personally check it out. They are gone... We saw it ourselves. But we shouldn't take a chance. KP is right. Leave Jimmy alone. Now she won't take the risk of tailing Jimmy. Jimmy's up to something... ...which is very important for laundering black-money. We have only one day. Shall we? There's some connection between the Bible and these places. What is he doing? Neither is he doing anything... nor are we? What do you want to do? - Forget it...let it be. Move-move... he's leaving...you know what you are supposed to do, right ? Yeah tell me - Found anything? - There's nothing here. Neither out here. I couldn't understand a single item on the menu card... ...so I pointed out to something. Now I am sipping on something that tastes like poison. Is it alcohol? No...I know the taste of alcohol very well He seems quite interested in dead people. Where is the bible? Ouch... You knocked over my drink. - I am sorry..! Can I buy you another one? Okay. How about dinner afterwards, handsome? - You're crazy. Taxi. How does she want to use the dead people? So what if I didn't answer your phone. I do know what 20 missed calls mean. Still you understand only this... and nothing else. Stop this charade, he's waking up. Who...who are you? I am the one who can send you to the hospital...or heaven. You decide. So you're making a database of all those people... ...whose families forgot to close their bank accounts after their demise. You're hacking their accounts and filling in your username and password. Apart from this you're developing another software... ...which can transfer money from one account to these 300,000 accounts... ...with the single click of a button. You're going to handover this software and database to Vicky. She will make small transfers of 15-20 dollars in those accounts. And gradually all the money... ...will get transferred to different safe-account. No government or agency of the world... ...can track such small transactions. So all the money will disappear. After transferring the money you will close all the accounts. So chapter over. - No...you're wrong. I am right. Please give me this hard-drive. If I don't give it to Vicky, she will kill me. I also want you to give her this hard-drive. Stupid fool, have you lost your mind? You want to give her this disk on your own. You do realize that if she doesn't get the disk... ...she can't transfer the money. But the money still stays with her, until we don't find her. You're taking a big risk. Do you know the consequences of failing? Call her. She's calling you instead. Speak to her...but carefully. Hello. All okay? - Yeah. Hi, Vicky Chaddha. Was leaving the country a charade... ...or you couldn't stay away from me? Don't refuse to come along today. Do you love me or... you want to kill me? - What do you think? My mind says that you will kill me. But the heart says otherwise. So will your heart decide... or your mind? Let's move. Her bullet may have missed... but definitely left a wound. So you want money and not love, huh! Such a long face over losing 20 percent. I want the all of it back... and not just 20 percent. Why and for what? A corrupt officer like you will never understand. Yes, I am corrupt. But I only take loose change. I've no intentions of robbing the entire nation, nor the stature. Back in our village, one has to walk for 5 kilometers to get drinking water. One has to sleight-hands even for your share of water from the tanker. Every person who hails from that place... ...only dreams about a simple ordinary life. But, how can anyone learn about honesty in a place ...where one has to sleight-hands for water. I understand. And I knew from day one... ...that you're not doing this for 20 percent. Whatever you do tomorrow, I am with you. Her name is Haniya. She's hiding in Libya's Tripoli city. The Tripoli police has been searching for her for the past few weeks. She's been accused of a small theft at her master's place. At the most, she'll be sentenced to four months imprisonment. But she won't get caught. She will run and get killed. We will kill her. And then I will take her place... ...and the Tripoli police will arrest me as Haniya. Indian government will never look for Vicky Chaddha... ....in the jails of Tripoli as Haniya. And four months later, I'll be free... ...and have a ball with all the money, as Haniya. Wow... This face is going to change again, KP. Monday afternoon 1 o'clock. Yes, ma'am. What if Karan fails to complete the task tomorrow? Then I will do it for you. Tomorrow morning there's going to be a big twist in the story... ...that everyone will be shocked. How? All I would like to say is that I've done my preparations. You must stay prepared as well. You know I won't come to the bank tomorrow. And you know I will definitely come to the bank tomorrow. Neither the government is with you nor the police. First Vicky, then Zafar, then Erica...and now Jimmy. How many times are you going to lose again? When we're trained to be a Commando... ...there's one thing which they teach us. Never give up trying... until you're alive. All the best. All the best to you too...Commando! If she is so confident... I'm sure she has some trick up her sleeve. Who's going to emerge out carrying Vicky's bag? Hello Mr. Iyer. - Karan, you were right. That bag is out of the locker... ...but there's a big surprise waiting for you. Black suit and silver bag! - Right What's the surprise? If only she was here, I would've touched her feet. What a brilliant lady. Go-go...get side. What? Keep your phone on. Aren't you going to stop this? - Just wait. Now it's the right time to celebrate. The money didn't go to the accounts of 300,000 dead people... ...in fact, it went to the right place. You were winning the game because I was letting you. But only till the semi-final. I won the final. If you hadn't made it to Bangkok... ...we could've never made it this far. We only staged the attack on the boat. And yes...fighting amongst ourselves... ...was a part of that drama. Bakhtawar, stop acting now. Now arrest her. I highly respected you, Vicky. But he turned out to be smarter than you. Your game was up long time ago. Karan, I am under an oath... ...to bring the black-money back in our country. But there's a problem. Your biggest problem is your... - Are you talking about me? Karan, I won't obstruct you in any way... ...but I cannot openly support you either. Because Vicky Chaddha's supporters will try something else. So we must all make a plan together. There are few things that can't be done in politics, Karan. Her son is involved too. I am not sad that he fell... ...but if his name is exposed, then the government can crumble. This hard-disk contains the bank details... ...of all the farmers of India. No need to bring the money back. It should directly go in their accounts. Because they are the ones who need it the most right now. The money has been transferred... ...in the accounts of 30 million Indian farmers... ...who die because of people like you. In fact, the Special Cell and the Home Minister... ...have been planning this for two years. In order to convince Runwal and company... ...that the Home Minister is on their side, we had to put up this charade. Karan's attraction towards you was planned. Bakhtawar changing sides was also planned. We were forced to kill Erica. Collateral damage. Home Minister's offer was planned. University, Terminal 21 mall, in fact... ...your escape during the Jimmy stint was planned as well. If the plan had flopped... ...then Bakhtawar would've taken the money from you. Your victory was impossible. Vicky, are you ready? You cannot arrest me. Who said we're going to arrest you? We're new generation officers. We do justice in our own style. And anyway, the police always settles their score. I will settle Jafar's account. Yes, sir. Congratulations, Karan. Mission accomplished. Thank you, sir. Would you prefer taking a break... ...or are you ready for the next mission? You know I am always ready. And this time I've even thought of a team. Okay...see you then. - See you, sir. Wait-wait... I will go on any mission after two days. I'll do some sight-seeing now. Because once you start... I won't get a chance. One more thing... I warned you about what I'll do... ...if you do something amazing again. So making a fool out of Vicky was your last mistake. Now your lips must pay for your brains. "Sweetheart... what ruckus have you created?" "...horns start blaring in my heart." "The sun's set...dusk is upon us." "As the night falls... I am coming after you." "You tried to rope in a commando." "Neither money nor your charms will work." "Sweetheart, your guy's not scared..." "...just try saying it once politely." "There's no point... in useless chatter." "Let's talk about love instead..." "...and promises of eternity." "My heart's dormant..." "...make it beat with your touch again." "Give me some peace... and some torment as well." "My arms are lonely." "You know I need you." "These eyes try to convey..." "You know I want you." "Let's forget the world ...come and sing this song." "Hare..." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "You're my one and only..." "...don't make me wait anymore." "Let me sway your body around..." "Boy I want you come a little close." "This night won't come again..." "...let this meeting last till the morning." "Let the heart's convey..." "You are my rainbow in the rose" "My arms are lonely." "You know I need you." "These eyes try to convey..." "You know I want you." "Let's forget the world ...come and sing this song." "Hare..." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram." "Hare Ram - Hare Ram." "Hare Krishna - Hare Ram."
