Working for a pittance of a salary... and spending your days being ordered around by a retarded boss. That is a sad, crappy life. Intern. Stand by for action. Yes, sir! Action, my foot. That crazy twerp. Bro, I'm sorry for making you do this again. Little schmuck. I've been told there are some strange men outside monitoring us. We've got it covered, sir. Who the hell are they? Get ready, everyone. This is not a drill. Let's go. Those schmucks are on my tail. Are you following us? I'm right next to you. There they come. Watch out for that car. I told you not to eat that bloody apple while driving. Friggin' morons. Chang-joon, we crashed. You take over. Copy that, sir. Ji-noo, I'm busted too. You're the only one left to follow the car. What? Me? What the heck? All right! Oh my, so sorry about this. We're not good at driving. Seriously, how did you even get your driving licence? Hey, no pictures! I think we'd better call the police. Could you call them, please? That's not necessary. Let the insurance company settle it. I don't know who you are... but you're in deep trouble. Deep trouble. - All clear. - Bloody morons. This is report from Hosan intersection. There has been a traffic accident. A five-tonne truck collided with an SUV. An ambulance is on its way. - Yoon Na-mi, where are you? - We need a tow truck. Isn't that right outside your house? What are you doing, Na-mi? Answer the darn radio. Do I really have to cut short my bath for a measly hundred bucks? Yoon Na-mi? Yoon Na-mi. All right, I'm coming. Na-mi is on the job. Five minutes away. - What? A car accident? Really? - Yeah, it's a pretty nasty one. - He would be lucky to survive this. - Darn! Get the hell out of there. Okay? Okay. Oh, yeah. What the heck? What do you want? Hey, moron! What do you want? Who the heck is that monkey? This must be her shop. Yes, and there she comes. Na-mi, let's go. It's time to knock-off. Go home...! Attaboy. Go home now. Get going. How is Bianca doing? She's okay. - Good night, Yakubu. - Good night to you too. Oh, my God! - I'll be back soon. - Make it quick. Yaku. You seem excited. Na-mi. So do you think you can get it all out? Don't look so surprised. Yaku, step back. How did she get here? What a sneaky little girl. Be careful. Excuse me. Who are you? You're not allowed in here! - You speak Korean very well. - Who the hell are you? Are you the owner of this car? He has been taken to the hospital. You saw it too. I'm not sure if he can make it out alive though. What the heck! Who are you then? There's no need to get heated. Well, I think I might know what's in there. No, it was a real car accident. I'll have it sent again tomorrow. Yes. It's those two guys. They refuse to identify themselves. Find the car. Are you the police? No. The prosecutors' office then? That's not it either. The National Intelligence Service? Wrong again. Who are you then? Why the hell are you watching us? How are you going to fix this? The car has been towed to a scrapyard nearby. Let's go. Let's follow them. I'm getting dizzy. Sexy! So, some dirty money disappeared during a botched delivery. They can't possibly report this to the police. Let's keep it. Oh, my almighty God! Let's keep the money. Man, what a lovely sight. I've worked here for eight years, even lost my arm... but I'm still an illegal immigrant. I'm married to Jung-sook, but I'm still an illegal immigrant. Since I'm an illegal immigrant, my baby is an illegal immigrant too. Illegal immigrants have to leave Korea, but I'm broke. I'm keeping this money, no matter what. Yakubu, stop being such a drama queen. Let's do it! Let's keep the money. With this sum of money, we can leave Korea right now. Okay! The two of us will do everything possible... to help you leave the country safely. - Why? - If they believe that Yakubu... left the country with all their money, what more can they do? Meanwhile, we can sit back and enjoy the money without worries. So let's be on good terms until then. Deal. Oh, yeah! This is why you've got to drive an expensive car. Enough of the running commentary already. Someone has already been here. There's a trailer that looks like it has just been cleared out. Look here, you'd better retrieve what was in that car. That's your only hope. Yes. I will get it back. Do you even know what was in that car? Money. How much money do you think there is in each suitcase? I don't know. A crap load, that's for sure! I'm going to splurge like crazy! I'm not wearing socks, so my feet are sweaty. No, it's okay. I'll do it. Why did you smell it? You have slender feet. What are you doing? Where are we anyway? Am I being kidnapped? This is my place. Do you want to come in? A crap load of cash and a tall, slender chick. I'm totally digging this! See you later, loser life. Their first night Are you done? Yeah. You were good. It has been quite a while and that felt really good. I should be the one thanking you. Your size and girth are perfect for me. You don't hold back, do you? Thanks anyway. Just look. Don't ask questions. I was born here and I've lived here all my life. What about your parents? Let's not go there. I'm done with sob stories for tonight. I want to do it one more time. Are you up for it? Sure. I am totally up for it. Shall we get started? What the hell happened? They knew about us. We've been played. You morons! I told you this wasn't a job for amateurs like us in the first place. Shut up! Wipe all the data from the computer. Then go to them and get down on your knees. Then what? We'll figure out a way to make a direct apology. If this turns sour, you're taking the fall. Get it? That's unfair! Why am I going down for this? Fine, don't worry. I'll cover for you. - How do you plan to do that? - Bloody hell! You should have done it right in the first place! Madam Yakubu! Long time. What a load of moolah! Is Yakubu a rich man now? It's none of your business, twerp. Maybe your bank... Speak Korean. You came to my shop because you maxed out your credit limit. Butt out. But anyway, I'm happy for Yakubu. This money has nothing to do with him. - It's mine. - I don't care. Money is money. Isn't that right, love? Is he Korean or African? Me? I'm a cosmopolitan. A citizen of the world. My name is Eumbuki Kim. Hello, Mama? This is Jung-sook. I wired some money. Money... It's the CCTV footage from the scrapyard. She had no idea and just dropped off the vehicle. That's right. That's the black dude's trailer in the scrapyard. That's it. Play it again. He didn't come to work today. His phone has been disconnected too. - What is his name? - Yakubu Mandela. He's an illegal immigrant from Ghana. We've put his name on the wanted list at the Immigration Office... and requested assistance from the National Police Agency. That schmuck can run, but he can't hide. Look at it carefully. If we can identify the licence plate... we can find the taxi driver. Okay. Abort mission! Yakubu's on wanted list. He can't board the plane! Crap. Jung-sook, we have a problem! Come here. I'd like to meet the chairman to convey my boss's apologies. - Who? You? - Yes. Your boss? Yes. My boss. - Which boss? - The one at the top. An illegal immigrant can board the plane after paying a fine. That's the law in Korea. They've already figured out that you took the money. Why? You want to take the risk? Those bureaucrats are full of crap. Don't you know that? No. Too risky. I'll leave with Bianca first. Get yourself a clean passport and join us later, okay? Yakubu, you mustn't get caught. Do you hear me? I've got money. I won't get caught. Mr Chairman, I'm the chief secretary. I'll connect you to the VIP. It's me. How are you? I am good. It's the top brass. Okay. It's an unholy mess. By the way, you piece of crap. Bring me all the intelligence you've gathered. I need to see it. There's nothing for you to see, sir. What? Do you think I'm stupid? I've destroyed everything as per instructed. You can kill me if you want to. But I promise you that I'll find your missing goods. You friggin' moron. Once the money leaves my hand, it's no longer mine. I don't give a crap about it. - Yeah, right. - That's very magnanimous of you. My life is in your hands now. If you can forgive me this time round, I'll work my fingers to the bone for you! Go to hell. Get the hell out of my face, worthless schmuck. Chairman, I'm at your command. Please take me in. I can be of use to you! Have you lost your mind? What's wrong with you? Just cut him some slack, sir. This is all a waste of taxpayers' money. Strictly speaking, we're just destroying evidence. Ji-noo, you'll be promoted to a permanent position next month. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Now that you're one of us, you have to protect our secret. Of course. And shave off that beard, for God's sake. Congratulations, man. But in any case, I need to know... what they were investigating me for and why. Sure. But even if they do find anything on you, they still couldn't touch you. But if things go wrong, they just might try their luck. If that happens, I'll pay them off to get them on our side... and I'll secure the evidence. Those friggin' fools with their pathetic efforts to survive. By the way, I've instructed them to retrieve the missing goods. After all, it's no small amount. You're a shrewd old man. - Dig in. - Thank you. Very fresh, very clean. Your face, his face? Same black face. Nobody knows. They are all just miserable immigrants... but I feel like I've walked into a tiger's den full of black tigers. Here, $2,000. Don't let me down. You're a rich man. Pay more. Beautiful. You won the lottery? I just want to go home! Yakubu, think about your poor fellow countrymen. Pay more. He's not going to attack us with that machete, is he? At least we work well as a team. Open the door! Who are these people? Everything is okay. Go back! Get lost! Yakubu, come on! Money has the same effect on people everywhere. Na-mi...! - What about Yakubu? - Yakubu? Isn't he coming? Watch out, Na-mi! Be careful. Are you okay? Tow truck driver, you're not allowed to park there! - Yakubu, you poor idiot. - Are you okay? Hello...? Would you treat him this way if he were American? You're discriminating against him because he's from Ghana, right? What charges are you pressing against him? Miss, one more word and I'll charge you with obstruction of justice. Obstruction of justice? That's friggin' ridiculous. I'll pick you up tomorrow, Yakubu. That woman has no respect for authority. This is pure racism. Take the wheel. You can't park here! Move your vehicle. Can you please park it for us? This truck is very special. Who are those freaks? I'm sorry, sir. We're fully booked tonight. There isn't even one vacant room in this huge hotel? Yes, we're fully booked. We only have the presidential suite left. What's a presidential...? - It's a huge room. - Oh, so it's a huge room. We'll take that. We'll pay with this. And this tip is for you because you're beautiful. Thank you, sir. Money talks. It does. This world is so messed up. Don't get angry. If it's good, it's good. Their second night This is the first time I'm sleeping with the same man twice. It's an honour. This is actually a confession. Don't feel pressured though. We did it twice last night. So this makes it our third time... strictly speaking. Let's make it a rule to do it twice every time. That's an excellent suggestion. The machete that woman is wielding... is dangerous. So very dangerous. Man, it's brutal to have to go to work. We've contacted the Immigration Office, but they're busy right now. You, you're free to go. It's time to go home. This moron is pretending he doesn't understand Korean. I'm going home... Bring the car out front. Yakubu, you know why you're here, right? I don't know. I just want to go home. - Teach him some Korean. - Yes, sir. Take me to the embassy, the Ghana Embassy. Speak Korean or I'll break your neck. Okay... I'll speak Korean. Please let me go. It hurts. Where's the money, you schmuck? - I don't know about any money. - You don't? - Where's the money? - What's going on in there? A man is getting beaten up! Good grief! Where's the money? Where is it? Officers, what are you doing? It's really peaceful here. You guys are real pacifists, aren't you? We found the suitcase! You did some serious digging, didn't you? Get it out! That's it. This way. Good! Yes, over here. Be careful with the excavator! Yakubu, you're an honest man. Why did you do it? No, I'm not honest. No more honesty. He's not a liar, I'll give him that. There's nothing else. That's all there is. Yakubu, don't play games with me. Where's the rest of the money? Spit it out. Nobody will give a hoot if some black dude gets buried here. - Go ahead! I dare you! - Why, you bloody twerp... There's no need for violence, sir! You bloody Ghanaian piece of crap. Be careful with that! You friggin' Korean! No more beating! I'm a free man! Crap! - Is he all right? - Is he dead? Call 119, you idiot! Make way, please. That girl who drives the tow truck has the rest of the money. - Get her now! - Yoon Na-mi? Yes! Na-mi, it's me. Don't go home. We've been busted. Forget about the money for now and stay away from your house. Darn. It's too high up. Money, how have you been? I'll get you down. Why is there only one suitcase? What the heck. Where has she gone to? Wait... you can't do that. I'm bleeding. Come on, pretty. What's the matter? - Let's talk this over. - Talk? What the hell are you doing in my house? Well, I... - This is very sharp and dangerous! - Let go! You let go of it first! Come here! Who the hell are you? You bloody thief. Crazy witch! Hey, lady. Where's the other bag? Stay down. Hands by your side. Wait a second! This is my house. How dare you barge into my house, you sneaky little weasel! How did things end up like this? - How did this happen? - It was just an accident. Scumbags. - Thank you, Doctor. - Take care. You must have been startled. Let's go. That poor idiot had no idea whose money he was trying to steal. We can't even contact his family. - I'll visit him from time to time. - Okay. Let's go to the tow truck driver's house. Chang-joon should have caught her by now. It's game over. It's a copy of his secret files. Hold on to it for now. Yoon Na-mi, twenty-seven years old. This neighbourhood was cleared out for redevelopment. But she stayed behind. So she was living here illegally? No, this property originally belonged to her father. But he committed suicide last year. By setting himself on fire. He burned himself to death? Anyway, she only had one bag. - Is that so? - She has an accomplice. And she's a total psycho too. Why? Did you get beaten up badly? I'm peeing blood. - Why? - What? Relishing in sinful lust all his life, his sins finally reach Mount Sumera. He casually smiles and turns to see the green mountain... still amidst the clouds. Mountains are mountains and rivers will be rivers. Are you absolutely sure this is the only copy? I'm positive. And that black fellow. It'd be for the best if he had just died. Yakubu? Let's send him back home before the media gets wind of this. But the hospital won't discharge him and I don't think he's fit to fly alone. We can't contact his family either. Hey. When I ask for something, don't give me excuses. Just get it done. I don't need to hear that crap about the law, your conscience or reputation. Just settle it. Yes, sir. I'll get it done. Good. I'll make the flight arrangements for him. Just keep looking out for the money. All right. Sit down and have your meal. Thank you so much. I want to kill those friggin' scumbags. They are just insignificant pawns in the major game plan. No. I'm going to make them pay for this. Yakubu... You didn't even get the chance to spend a penny. Na-mi. Since it has come to this, let's go and spend some money. Yakubu, I'm really sorry. Let's spend some money. When I was in university, I cooked, ate, slept... and had sex here for over five years. But I still chalked up thousands of dollars of debt. For $2,000 more, you can get an unregistered car. Is this enough? Park my truck, please. - Who the heck are they? - I guess they won the lottery. Let's hit it! This is not as effective as it looks. You might end up just aggravating your opponent. That's a tear gas gun. It's far more effective... but I can't show you or we will all end up tearing like mad. Why is it so hard to get a real gun in this country? It sucks. You'll need a government permit for these. Any illegal ones? Something like this? Is that a real gun? A fine piece of craftsmanship. It's a little loud though. Oh, crap! Get some water... Hey... Wait! Aren't you going to buy this? What did your people do at my place? Well, nothing much. I heard about your dad. I don't blame him for what he did. It was his choice to leave the world like that. I get by just fine, living my life the way I want. Yeah! - Ji-noo. - Yeah? I want to do it now! Okay! That will make it six times in total so far. Their third night Ji-noo, thanks for everything. Why are you thanking me? For being nice to me. You're beautiful... and pretty awesome. I feel so good. I'm so happy right now. Look at that. They're like best buddies. This is the last time. Hi, Yakubu. Are you feeling okay? They're going to discharge you. You're going to take a flight home. Home? I'm going back to Ghana? Get the car and wait outside. Ji-noo. Don't leave. I'm scared. You're scared? Get out of here. Look at him, Dr Kim. He's out of the woods now. What are you talking about? He had a massive head injury. Oh, don't nitpick. Darn that twerp. Sneaky schmuck. Everybody is here at the hospital and I'm getting a real bad feeling. I think we're going to get caught. Forget about Yakubu. I might have to take flight myself. Follow your gut. Just keep me posted. What are they planning to do with Yakubu anyway? Poor schmuck. You came all the way here, hoping to make a living. But look at you now. We've cancelled your flight home. You're going to jail instead! - What? - Na-mi and Ji-noo sold you out. They told us everything. No. Na-mi, Ji-noo, and Yakubu are best friends. Best friends? - Hey, Apple. - Yes. Go to the office and get Ji-noo's address. Search his place. Yes, sir. What do you think you're doing? You heard us make arrangements with the doctor. Stay out of this. Ji-noo and Na-mi each took a suitcase. Is that correct? Perhaps they did... I don't see Yakubu. It's just those twerps from my office. I'll call you back. Sneaky little rat. He had some nerve to do that right under my nose. Mum. Dad. I've moved out of our house. Just so you know. Have I been busted? Ji-noo. You went to a good university, did well for your exams... and you're a hard worker. I liked you. Is this who you really are? The real me? Well, I... You have the guts but not the brains obviously. Are you getting nervous, Ji-noo? Relax, man. Yeah. What did you find? Play smart or we'll all be dead. There's nothing here. In fact, his place is so small... there's no space to hide anything. They are already searching my place? That's fast. What did you do with the money? Did you bury it too? What is this money you're talking about? Out with it. He means business. The money is with the girl. - Yoon Na-mi? - Yes. Where is she now? How would I know? You've got a lot of nerve. He's not wearing his safety belt. The question is, how fast will this guy react? You've got a lot of nerve. Hell, I'll risk it! His safety belt jammed! You friggin' schmuck! Hey! Is everything all right? Who are you? What's going on? He looks like he should be in a hospital. That's why I upgraded his flight to first class. He is fit for travel. But he has to transit at Dubai. How is he going to do that on his own? Don't worry. Our men in Dubai will take care of that. I see. But please note that the captain has the right to stop him from boarding. I've already spoken to your boss. Didn't he call you? Of course, sir. - Do it. - Yes, sir. Jung Yu-jin. If you were working under me... I would have long fired you, you dumb slut. You're nothing without your breasts. Who the hell does that schmuck think he is? I've been promiscuous lately. Promiscuous? Sexually? Yes, sexually. I don't know how promiscuous you've been, but is that considered a sin nowadays? I'm glad to hear that, Father. Speak of the devil. He's calling me now. I've got to take this. Sure, go ahead. I want to hear your conversation too. Where is Yoon Na-mi? Where's the money? I'll tell you. We can talk it out. It's at Hotel Opera, Room 1306. Head over there now. Bye, Father! I thought this was automatic. - Do you need a hand? - Yes, please. But it's pretty heavy. Why is it so heavy? Welcome to Hotel Opera, sir. The guest hasn't checked out yet. You can't do this! You told me they put Yakubu on a plane. The captain refused to let him board. So what happened? He was left alone in the airport for two days. They just left him there. I've brought him back. Hell. Okay. Hey, look at the camera. Get ready to film. Look here! Hey. We haven't got all day. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, darling. I'm going to rip this friggin' world apart. Sook... I missed you, Sook. I missed you so much. I missed you. - I kept thinking about you. - Really? To think you can get it up, even in this state. Hi, Na-mi. It's Ji-noo, the man who landed in hot water... after discovering tonnes of cash. We did it six times over three nights, didn't we? It all started out because of the money. I thought we could do it... a hundred times more. But now... I'm not so sure. Can we do it without the money? Vicious schmucks. What are you going to do now, Jung-sook? I can't leave Yakubu. I was with him even before he lost his arm. I will never betray him. I will never do that. I guess you and Ji-noo were sleeping together. Not that it's any of my business. You're right. We were sleeping together. I hate to bring up money at this point... Let's not talk about it then. Fine. We were never serious anyway. Ruthless witch. I've got to be a ruthless witch. Yoon Na-mi, don't behave as though it meant something to you! It was nothing but a fling. You've got to be strong. I need to be mean. I've got to be real mean! We've got a message from Yoon Na-mi. Yeah? Let's see it. Go to hell! - Crazy witch. - She's a real piece of work. Show it to him too. Our men are searching for her and we're tracking her mobile phone. It's a matter of time before we catch her. What about him? Sweet... Ji-noo, look at yourself now. Why did you have to get involved with her? You were in line for a permanent position. A permanent position? How nice. I'll get regular pay and insurance entitlement. It's the best. Right through till you're sixty-two. - Are you going to the toilet? - No, I'm going home. You should clock off too, Chang-joon. No one is coming to fetch me. So I'd better start making my way home. Ji-noo. - Don't do this, Ji-noo. - Don't touch me! You're violating my right of freedom! I'm not going to let this slide anymore. Do you know why? That's because it's a breach of the constitution. I can't stand the sight of him. And you guys... have to kill me if you want to stop me. Otherwise, I'm going wherever I want to. - Don't follow me. - Okay. Get him. Look at that ugly mug. Paper company in the Virgin Islands... Look at what we've got here. Hang in there, Ji-noo. I'm coming for you. It's an email from Yoon Na-mi. With a large attachment. Where did she get this? We're in trouble. Turn the car around. It has found its rightful owner. It's perfect for you. I'll put it to good use. Well, hello there. Did you get my email? That was just a preview. To whet your appetite. One wrong move, and the whole thing will be all over the Internet. So no funny tricks. Don't even think about it. Hey. I can't believe you came here again. - Ji-noo. - Stop! Please stop. Ji-noo... it's me, Ji-noo. It's me. Na-mi? Why did you come to this evil place? Who else is going to come and save you? Save me? What happened? These are designer sunglasses. I'm the chief secretary. I'd like to speak to the two of you privately. I'm sure we can reach a satisfactory settlement. What a sorry sight. This is such a warped world, even the young are slaves to money. How pathetic. Thanks to you, those young punks just took a crap all over me. You friggin' piece of trash. - I deserve to die, sir. - Good. Go and kill yourself, you brainless schmuck. - Yes, sir. - My chief secretary... I can't believe you are still collecting your salary after such an epic failure. You cost me more than ten million bucks every year. - What? - And that doesn't even include... the twenty million in stock options. To think you still had the nerve... to foil my plan, you friggin' piece of crap! He sure has a potty mouth. I betrayed you at one point. Do you know that? I love this smell. God, I love this smell. What smell are you talking about? The smell of freedom. We went to hell and back for that money. My pride has been so damaged that I can't possibly let this slide. What's the use of having so much money when I feel so miserable inside? They put us through hell and there's nothing we can do. I can't take it lying down. I want my revenge. I want to get my money back. Yakubu, do you really want to do that after everything we've gone through? - Yes. - Yes? I understand the desire for payback... but we might just get ourselves into trouble again. Yakubu, this world is hell. And in hell, money rules. When the job is done, you'll get this much more. Oh, yeah? What can I do for you? I have no fear! That USB flash drive. Will the chairman be badly affected if they disclose everything? It would be nothing more than a brief moment of embarrassment. Why can't he just live a normal life? Those losers probably make five bucks an hour. They are just clueless punks. There's no need for this. We'll accede to their request for now. We'll give them a taste of how the adults play later. Big moolah! Load it in the car. Yes... okay. This is the suitcase that Yakubu buried. We brought it as per your instructions. Yeah, baby! I'm terribly sorry for what happened to Yakubu. I know this isn't much, but it's a token of our apology. We're really sorry. Aren't you going to take it? You heartless beasts! Your heads are a waste of space! Oops, slip of hand. Oh my. Friggin' puppet masters pulling everyone's strings. Go to hell! So have you seen what we're capable of? But how could you do this? - Chang-joon! - Yes, sir. I guess you still don't know why they had to die like that. Hey, boy. Answer good and you'll survive. What the hell is he saying? I know... You do? So I guess you also know why you'll have to die like they did. But I was only carrying out orders. I'm just a hired hand. You know that. Pathetic loser. Help... But then again, it's wrong to follow orders blindly. So you do understand. You're a lucky boy. Be a good man. There's no need to be so jumpy. Spectacular! I love it! I love a good bloodbath! The bodies of two middle-aged men were found this afternoon. One of them was decapitated with his arm was severed... while the other was also beheaded and set on fire. Bloody retards. The police suspect this could be done by a gang of illegal immigrants. They are now hunting down the boss, Kim Bong-nam... also known as Eumbuki Kim. According to sources, the victims were a senior civil servant... and a corporate executive. The police has declined to comment on the grounds of privacy. Just as we promised. This has spiraled out of control. Only the weak and pathetic ends up dead. Let's say a bit of justice was served. By the way, haven't we met before? At that house by a gas station? You remember. Penniless as hell, but you had divinely beautiful bodies. Even the drawings on the wall were beautiful. He seems like a fine gentleman. Thank you for the compliment anyway. That schmuck is just full of crap. Don't flare up. Well, it wasn't even a lot of money to begin with. You'll spend everything in no time. In other words, you will go back to being penniless and worthless again soon. And over time... those beautiful bodies of yours will age and sag. That's life for you. You just need to suck it up. It's not my fault your life is crap. Shut the hell up already. What's going on? You would have lived longer if only you knew when to shut up. That's enough. If you kill him, there's no turning back.
