People would rather live in homes regardless of its grayness. If we walk far enough, says Dorothy, we shall sometime come to someplace. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! I thought you took him to school. Yes. That was this morning. - What time is it now? - Like 4:30. - It's late. - Yeah. We'll be leaving in a couple of minutes. - I need to talk to Cody for a minute. - Sure. Cody. What I'm about to tell you is very important. Mommy, are you mad at me? No, baby, I'm not mad at you. I just want you to pay close attention to me, okay? Only mommy is inside your heart. And only Cody is inside Mommy's heart. No one else. Okay? - Okay? - Okay. Hello? She's out all day. Nobody knows where she goes. Why would she have herself... I'm home. Honey, we're in here. Why are you all sitting in the dark? Hi. - Did you have a good day? - Busy. Kiss. Are you going to say hello, or are we invisible to you? Hello, mother. And Carmen? - Hello, Carmen. - Hi. I'm happy to see you've taken your camera with you. Did you get some good shots? - Yes, I think so. - Yeah? Great. Pizza? It's so unhealthy. It's so greasy. We didn't know what time you'd be back. - So we just ordered. - Yeah. It's actually pretty good. I can warm you up a slice. No, thank you. How about a sandwich? Take me two minutes. No, that's okay. - Have you eaten today? - Yes. I stopped and had a salad. Where have you been? Out. Out? What is that supposed to mean? Your cell phone is always turned off. No one knows where you are or where you're going. So what? Now I have to report to you where I'm going and what I'm doing? Not a report, it's courtesy. What on earth are you wearing? What are you wearing? What do you mean? Where did you go? What did you do? Shh! Shh! He's asleep. I can see that. Hmm. Where did you get this Wizard of Oz book? It was in the bag you left on the bench at the playground this afternoon. Really? Yeah. I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart. Why are you crying? Tell me what's wrong. Nothing. I'm fine. Kiss me. You don't want to kiss me? Goldie and Carmen are downstairs. So what? Oh, God! You never have time for me. You always have something to do. There's always someone here. Don't you find that strange? We're never alone. And yet, I feel so deeply alone. I came home. You weren't here. I asked Carmen to order pizza. - We opened a bottle of wine. - Hmm. And waited. I don't understand why you're making a big deal. Maybe you would understand if I were to draft a legal brief explaining how violated and trespassed I feel in my own home? What on Earth are you talking about? Even when I speak in your lingo, I don't make sense. So just forget it. You don't understand me. No. I don't understand you. Why do you always say the wrong thing to upset her? Every little thing bothers her nowadays. Mother. - I need to ask you a favor. - Yes? Never ever show up in my house again, without calling first. Elyse? Carmen. Dear Carmen. You are never to have dinner with my husband alone unless I invite you. Goldie invited me. - I don't give a fuck if Santa Claus invited you. - Stop it! I get it. I can respect house rules. You've made yourself perfectly clear. You are way out of line, talking to us in this manner. It's time you grow up and stop acting like a spoiled, entitled, narcissistic little brat throwing tantrums for attention. Attention? Hah! Grow up. Get out of my house! Get out of my house! What was that about? She's desperate for attention, sweetheart. I think she needs help. It's true. One minute she's laughing, dancing, singing. She tells me she loves me. The next minute, she hates me. She's crying, off-the-wall angry. Has this look like she wants to kill me. Fuck! - Elyse? - I hate her! Honey? Sweetheart, sweetheart. - What? - Stop, stop, stop! - No. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. - Calm down. - I hate her! She's done this my whole fucking life. - I want to die. - Shh! Shh! It's okay. Sweetheart, I think you need to see a doctor. I have someone. Michael recommended. You've been talking to people in the office about me? I can't believe you. No, no, no. Not at all. - Michael's a friend. - So what, he's your friend. I don't want you talking to people in the office about me. This is our private life. Sweetheart, you need to see a doctor. And you need to get back on medication. No. No. I'm not seeing a doctor, and I'm not getting back on medication. Why am I not allowed to have feelings with... without being told there's something wrong with me? Sweetheart, Michael's doctor saved his life. His wife left him. She took their kids. He was almost disbarred. Now he's doing great. I don't give a shit about Michael. Okay, I can see this conversation is going nowhere. Hello? Hi, Brian. Yes, this a good time. Yes. We can do that. Sure. Mm-hmm. I think we can wrap it up next week. I'll call you tomorrow. After lunch. Oh, give my love to Laura and the kids. Yup, bye. Can we talk? What's so important? What have I done wrong? You make it pretty obvious you don't like me. - Poor you. - Oh, give me a break. Can't you just talk to me, woman-to-woman? Unless, in your eyes I'm simply the housekeeper's daughter. Not allowed to address you directly, and always to be restricted to the maid's quarters. If that's how you see me, I can't continue living here. Always playing the little victim. I'm not the victim, but I do want know what's going on. You want to know that the fuck is going on? Yes, I do. You're too God damned familiar with my husband. You don't respect our space. Now I see. Goldie was right. What bothers you is I work at the firm with Steven. You got the job at the firm because of me. Oh, okay. Well, how gracious of you. Thank you. It's late. Goodnight. Carmen. Wait. The truth is I feel like I'm slowly losing my mind. And I don't know what to do about it. I can see the damage that I am causing you and everyone in my life. I see your pain. I feel it. You know I'm here for you and Steven. Yes, I know. So, Steven recommended I see a doctor. He mentioned, a Michael in your office. Yeah. Michael Davis. I don't know him that well, but I heard he was in treatment for depression or addiction. I don't know. I might go see this doctor. Good idea. Well, good night. Good night, Elyse. Sorry you're caught in the middle of all this. It's painful to watch. I know. I know it's none of my business, and perhaps I'm overstepping my boundaries, but I think Elyse is suffering from something very serious. I agree. Do you think it would help the situation if I move out? Give up my internship with you? I can go to another law firm. I do have other options. No. You're not going anywhere. You working at the firm is not the problem. Maybe it is. Steven, please, listen to me. You're a great husband. And you give her everything. You work so hard. You have this beautiful home, but no one's happy. It's tragic. You're absolutely right. This place is an empty shell of vanished dreams. Don't say that. Elyse told me you mentioned Michael Davis? And that you want her to see his doctor? She said she wants to go. She knows something isn't right. She said that? Yeah, she did. Thank you. Gracias. Buenas Noches and good evening. With us on saxophone, we have Oscar Lopez. I'll have one more. - And on Spanish guitar... - One more coming up. - The first number of the evening is... - Make it a double. ...BÃ©same mucho. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure, make it a double. And I want a shot on the side. Mm. Mm. - Can I buy you a drink? - Can't drink on the job. No. I bet you could if you really wanted to. This one's on me. But I dare you to go onstage and dance. - I love a dare. - That's what I thought. Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Oh. I just had a crazy dream. Oh. I was at a Latin night club. The place was packed. And I started dancing through the crowd. Carmen was onstage singing. - Our Carmen? - Yes. Your Carmen. I'm teasing. Why can't we go out? Have some fun? Go dance. Drink. Live it up. Sure. Why not? Why not? Can you believe, Carmen on stage? Singing? In the dream? Yes. In the dream. I have to leave. I'm running late. - I love you. - Love you, too. - What time will you be back? - Seven. - You'll call me from the office? - I will. I love you, baby. They're claiming they have a witness. Uh, let's wait and see. Okay. I'm drafting up the papers this morning. I'll call you later to go over the questions you have. Right. Okay. "California Bar Exam Total Prep." Oh, here you are. You barely touched your breakfast. Yeah, I'm not hungry. How was Cody on the way to school? He seemed a little tired. Why? For some reason he had a hard time falling asleep. Oh. So, tell me, what can I do for you? Why are you here? - Escher. You have two Eschers. - Mm-hmm. - Are they originals? - No prints. Reproductions. - You like Escher? - Oh, I love Escher. I love everything about his work. So full of infinite mystery. Great artist. Huh. Pretty impressive, isn't he? Hmm. I also love Maxfield Parrish. Oh, yes. What is it you love about Maxfield Parrish? His blue skies. What do you associate with his blue skies? Childhood. Excuse me. I hate crying. It's so silly to cry. So stupid. Oh, crying is not silly or stupid. At least, I don't think it is. Who told you that crying is stupid? My mother. - That's a beautiful tie. - Thank you. I love that color, burgundy red. - Did your wife pick that out for you? - Oh, yes. My wife picks out all things for me. - What's your wife's name? - Harriet. It's a beautiful name. Hmm. Don't you think it's lovely that wives like to shop for their husbands? I mean, I buy all of Steven's clothes. Shirts, ties, underwear. Everything. So, tell me, why are you here? How can I help you? What can I tell you that you haven't already heard from my mother or husband? Oh, I don't know. I thought, um... perhaps it would be better to hear it from you. Hello? Sorry, did you just say something? I asked why you came to see me. How can I help you? Doctor Lewis, something tells me you're really sharp. Well, thank you. I think you're pretty sharp yourself. People's possessions are fascinating. Everything we collect tells a story. The places we've been and the people we've met. What is this? A ladybug? No, it's a beetle. It's the same family as a ladybug, but that's a scarab beetle. Jung's window. - Who? - Doctor Carl Jung? The intellectual lady and her dream of the golden scarab? - Ah, so you know the story? - Yes, I do. - Yeah. Jung and synchronicity. - Do you believe in synchronicity? - No. Absolutely not. "Absolutely not." - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? You think so? - Are you a Jungian or a Freudian? - Oh, I don't know. I'm just a... just a working doctor, that's all. And your wife chooses your ties for you. Yeah. How quaint. Your mother told me that you were a photographer. Hmm. - Hmm. - Is that a yes or a no? Yes, I guess I am. Oh, good. What are your favorite subjects? Oh, I used to enjoy black-and-white landscape photography. Hmm. And no more? Lately not much inspires me. The world looks so dull and gray. I started carrying my camera around. I carry it because it makes my husband happy. So, tell me, how are you feeling right now? What do you mean how do I feel? I'm fine. Tell me about your father. I didn't know him. I was a baby when he died. Oh, dear, I'm sorry. Your mother never told me that. I'm not surprised. She only talks about herself. Hmm. Well, you know, perhaps she forgot to mention it. Hmm. Tell me a little bit about your mother. - She's a lying bitch. - Oh. What sort of lies does she tell you? Everything in her life is a lie. She lives a fabricated life. A fairy tale. Embellished reality. - I see. - And you know what she told me once? She told me my father was so lucky to have died before he was able to see the horrible, nasty person I'd become. Ah. How old were you when she told you that? Eight, maybe nine. And then she told me I was just like my father. Worthless. I laughed right in her face when she said that. - And then when I was fourteen, I ran away from home. - Mm-hmm. They caught me and put me in juvenile hall. I didn't mind being locked up. It was better than being with her. You know, I saw my father and my grandmother when I was locked up? You saw your father and your grandmother? I used to hear them at night when the other girls were asleep. Ah, I see. Yes. It was all lies, what my mother said about my father. My grandmother told me the truth. He worked hard in the business he built. He made a lot of money. And mother loved that money. She loved that money so much, she killed him. - She killed him? - Yes, in a way. He had a heart attack, but see, she said... she said his heart attacked him. Oh, it made me laugh when she said that. "His heart attacked him." But you know, in a way, it made sense. The heart, the wayward heart, is just a wild animal, a beast that needs to be tamed. She warned me that if I followed my heart, if I followed my wayward heart, if I followed my dreams, then I would be killed too. - So I killed my own heart. - Hmm. Oh, screw her, I thought. Fuck you, lady. It's better that way. Heartless, dead, same thing. Yeah. Why the smile, doctor? I'm just listening. - And? - Well, about, uh, your mother. People often say things they really don't mean. She meant it. You better believe she meant it. But you know, she's also useful to me in her own way. How? Whatever she says, I use it as reference to do the opposite. - Ah! - And she thinks she's so smart. Doctor, are you free this Saturday? It's my husband's birthday and I'm hosting a dinner party for him. I would love for you to join. Harriet too. Oh, thank you. That's most gracious of you, Elyse. Unfortunately, I'm not available this Saturday. Is your husband looking forward to the dinner party? - Yes, I think he is. - Ah. Anything to avoid being alone with me. Why would he avoid being alone with you? 'Cause I think my husband's afraid of me. Afraid of you, why? I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to make a suggestion, Elyse. Just a recommendation. It may be a good idea for you to arrange some date nights. Date nights with you? With your husband. - I'm just kidding. - Yes, I know you are. Oh, you see, couples sometimes, you know, they spend too much time apart and I think a date night is a way to have fun and get to know each other. - Yeah. Yes. I think it's a good idea. - Good. Do you go on date nights with Harriet? Well... Okay, I think that's it. Wonderful session. So, next week I think your husband's arranged with my assistant, um... I think it's two sessions next week. I'm not surprised that he did. Thank you, Elyse. Well done. - Hi, Elyse. - Is my husband in his office? Yes, of course. I'll tell him you're here. Hi, Jeff. Yeah. Elyse is on her way up. Thanks, bye. Oh, hi. I saw that that report that you... Oh, hi. It's good to see you. - Can I get you something to drink? - No, I'm good. Thanks. - Call me later? - Okay. Great. I didn't know you were coming by today. Well, I just had my session with Doctor Lewis. His office is really close by. It's just a few blocks away. I know. - How did it go? - I like Doctor Lewis. I mean, he's intelligent, handsome. We had a great session. What did you talk about? Lots of things. But, you know, there was none of that New Age psychobabble nonsense. Your friend Michael was absolutely right. That's great. I'm glad you liked him. I told him about your birthday dinner on Saturday. I invited him. He said he might come. - You invited him? - Yeah. Why not? I know you don't like parties. I told Doctor Lewis about that and we both laughed. - Who else did you invite? - Hmm. A few friends. My mother. Carmen. I'm keeping it simple. Trust me, honey, it'll be fun. Doctor Lewis thinks the party's a great idea. He wants us to find time to celebrate life. Anyway, today's session was just about getting the basics out of the way and getting acquainted. Great. - So you'll see him again? - Hmm. I'm seeing him the same time next week. - You made sure of that. - Great. Sweetheart, I have an urgent call to make in about a minute. So I'll see you later. - And you're going to go here. - Mommy! Mommy! - Are you excited about Daddy's birthday? - I am. It looks beautiful. What else did you do for Daddy? Um, I made daddy a picture. Show me. This is me. That's daddy and that's you. - Why don't I have a smiley face, baby? - I don't know. - Will you fix it? - Yes. Yes, I could, Mommy. Thank you, baby. Yes. That's better. I see, so that's what influenced the jury? Partially. But you can't always rely on the testimony of a paid expert witness. Look at her. That's like her fifth or sixth glass of champagne. If I don't bring that cake out, it's going to be a fiasco. - See? - Yeah. - She's clearly drunk. Yes, she is. I think you're going to have to bring the cake in. Excuse me. - Wait. - Oh. Oh, right. I forgot. You don't drink. Let me ask you something. You know Doctor Lewis, right? Yes. I do. Steven told me that you're bipolar and you drink to feel better. He said you almost lost your wife and kids, but then Doctor Lewis saved your ass. I really wouldn't like to talk about that. It's okay. I met Doctor Lewis, too. I mean, I'm not bipolar or alcoholic or anything like that though everyone thinks there's something wrong with me. What do you think? Do you see anything wrong with me? No. Not at all. Look at him. He's so uptight. His own world. âª Happy birthday, dear Steven âª âª Happy birthday to you âª Make a wish. Happy birthday. You fucking bitch. You think I don't see what you're doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? You're a sick-ass drunk bitch. - Stop it! Stop it! - I'm the sick fuck? You're in my house, you stupid bitch! What the hell is wrong with you? Elyse! Why in the hell did you throw a party, if you're going to ruin it for everyone? - Fuck! - Steven? Baby? I'm sorry, baby. Baby? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry! Oh, God! Steven! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good morning, Elyse. Let me see those bruises. Okay, let me see your... let me see your other one. Okay, okay, okay. I'm going to take your blood pressure now. Oh, so here you are. You barely touched your breakfast. This will take just a few seconds. 120/180. Still in the normal range. This will take just a few seconds. Oh, my dear, this is the worst I've seen you. You look really tired. You haven't been taking care of yourself. I'm having trouble sleeping. Oh. I haven't been sleeping at all. - How's Carmen doing? - She's still with her family. She was supposed to return last week. She left me a message that she needed more time. It must be a very difficult time for her, poor sweetheart. She's strong. She'll be okay. It's no five-star hotel, but it certainly is better than where they had her. What a putrid color on these walls. I'm going to get some coffee. Mr. Bridges? Doctor Lewis will see you now. Right this way. Please, have a seat. The doctor will be with you in just a moment. - They have a morning appointment. - Thanks. - Who are they? - Uh, Mr. Bridges and Mrs. Madison. Thank you. Okay. Hello. Doctor Lewis, this is Mr. Bridges and this is Mrs. Madison. Mrs. Madison. Mr. Bridges. Please, sit down. . Thank you. Thank you for coming in. I understand that this must be quite a difficult time for you both. - It's incomprehensible. - The pain is excruciating. Yeah. I bet it is. Last Friday when your wife was transferred here to this hospital, I saw her just briefly... it was last Friday, wasn't it, Jennifer? - Last Friday, yes. - Yeah, last Friday. I saw her just briefly. It was rather late in the day and, um, I was only able to run a few preliminary tests on her, you see? When was the last time you saw your wife, Mr. Bridges? I've only seen her once. And that was the, um, day after she was admitted. Uh, and our lawyer made several attempts to get permission for me to visit again, but, um, his requests were all denied. Well, that's normal legal procedure in cases such as these. Excuse me. Yes? No, it's 4:30. I don't know, she talked to Carter, I think. Check on it. Yeah. Sorry about that. Right, now. I need to prepare you for some not altogether encouraging news. Your wife continues to remain in a state of severe catatonia. - It's been almost three months. - Mm-hmm. What treatments has she received? Ativan. Pretty high dosage. Eight milligrams, uh, three times a day. - That's all? - No. ECT authorization has been submitted and is pending court approval. - That's, uh, ECT? That's electroconvulsive therapy? - Right. They can't do that without our approval. That decision rests with the state, Mrs. Madison. Not with the family. Okay, so now I need to ask some specific questions about her past. Was she ever given a psychiatric evaluation or diagnosis? - She saw countless doctors when she was younger. - Hmm. Some said she was borderline schizophrenic. Some said bipolar. All prescribed different medications. Can you remember the medications? Well, everything from Prozac to Lithium. Nothing ever worked. - Lithium? - Lithium. - Okay. A family friend recommended we see his shaman in Arizona. And so we went. Then he recommended we see his teacher in Peru. Flew there, too. They aligned her chakras. We did drum circles. Complete waste of time and money. - Hmm. Drum circles? - Yes. - Okay. Has she ever been hospitalized? A long time ago. She cut her wrist when she was fifteen. Attempted suicide? - It was more a cry for attention. - I never heard that. Attempting suicide is never a cry for attention, Mrs. Madison. It's symptomatic of something deeper, something more serious. - Is there history of suicide in your family? - Yes. My daddy committed suicide. Oh, my God! I should have been told. What else don't I know? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. It's something we don't talk about. Tell me, Mr. Bridges. What was it like living with Elyse? Us? Well, you know, it's been hell. Um... - Does that answer your question? - Yeah. Oh, I found these strange photographs in her camera. - They're very odd. - My daughter is an excellent photographer. - Maybe they can tell you something. - These photos are amateur. - Thank you. - Sure. Oh, they're interesting. Uh, can I keep these in her file? - Yeah. - There's one thing. Obviously she's been displaying unusual behavior for quite some time. I'm just curious as to why you never sought out some medical or psychiatric help before this event. Well, I tried. I never thought it would, um, escalate to this point. In hindsight, I guess I should have insisted she get help. Given this collateral information, my preliminary diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder and Severe Depression. And I mean, severe depression. Catastrophic, given attempted suicide, you know? However, our immediate goal is to bring your wife, your daughter out from this catatonic state. And, uh, this afternoon... Did that fucking ECT authorization come through? - It should arrive this afternoon. - Good. I've seen remarkable results, even after the first treatment. - Good morning. - Good morning. Elyse, swallow. God, God, God! Let's step out of the room. I know seeing your daughter in this condition is very painful. As difficult as it is to understand, um, it is possible that she's cognizant of her environment. Let me walk you to the waiting room. I need to get back to the room. The nurse's station is there if you need anything, okay? Thank you for taking her out of the room. I tried to feed her the rest of the yogurt, but she's not swallowing. Yeah. We removed the feeding tube and IV on Friday, so. It will be a little time before her swallowing improves. I was concerned about the feeding tube. Yeah. It's definitely a good sign. You have my cell. Let me know when she's scheduled for ECT. Yes. Doctor Lewis always recommends the family be present, so I'll definitely be calling you. ECT treatments are very effective. Yes, Doctor Lewis told me. You'll see tremendous improvement after a few treatments. Hopefully, she'll be able to start physical therapy soon. Oh, and for that reason, would you mind bringing Elyse some comfortable clothes and shoes? You know? For the therapy? Uh, yes, of course. Thank you. I'll be waiting for your call. - Good afternoon. - Hello, doctor. Good afternoon, Elyse. - How is she doing? Is she eating? - Not much. Elyse? I want you to try to sit up. Help her sit up. At the edge of the bed. Good. You can take your arm away. Good. Elyse? Do you know where you are? Do you know today's date? Or the month? Or the year? I'm going to take your arm. Gently. Let it come with me. That's good. Good. Elyse, are you aware that there may be something wrong? Can you describe how you feel at this moment? Displaying waxy flexibility, characteristic of catatonia. Lay her back. The authorization for ECT is on your desk? Yes, doctor. - What time is it? - It's scheduled for 7:30 in the morning. - 7:30. Doctor Rosenthal is set up? - Yes. Yes. They are. Good. Bye, Elyse. Elyse? Tomorrow, 7:30. - Good morning, Doctor Lewis. - Good morning. Everything ready? Good. Mr. Bridges, this is Doctor Rosenthal, Mr. Bridges. Your wife is in good hands with Doctor Rosenthal. And I'll come back as soon as the treatment is over. All right? - Doctor Rosenthal? - Thank you, Doctor. - It's all yours. Thank you for being here. I want to walk you through the procedure. Mrs. Bridges, my name is Doctor Rosenthal. Today we're going to be performing ECT to treat your catatonia. You'll be put under anesthesia so you shouldn't feel a thing. And the court has authorized this treatment for you. Do you have any questions? Anything you want to say? Are there any long term repercussions I should be concerned with? No. No cumulative adverse effects. Okay. Let's begin. What a beautiful woman. She did well for her first treatment. She should come to very shortly. Probably within the hour. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Oh, they're so beautiful! Oh! My big belly! - Mm, I love you. - I love you. Doesn't she look like a ballet dancer? She's like... Ah, so beautiful. Stay with me. Back up. Could this be any more beautiful? - They look like dancers, these trees. - Oh, I know. We're having a baby. I love you. Oh, look at this one! Oh, oh, I love it. This'll look great in the new house. I want to blow them up. - I love you. - I love you. I'm getting you! How much do you love me? Oh, that much? This much! Show me your tummy. Oh, yeah. Oh, you look good. Oh! You're silly! I also brought some clothes like you asked. Thank you. She'll be more comfortable. Is that the pillow? It's roses. She loved roses. She loves roses. One second. Ask Doctor Lewis to call me. - Will do. - Yeah. Well, now that I know you love roses, I'll bring you one from my mother's garden, okay? Would you like a white or a red rose? Elyse? Well, guess what? I've just become a mind reader. I think you prefer red roses. Don't you? - Steven? - Coming. My friend Bianca, she'll be here between four and six to pick up the rest of my things. I hope that's okay. I'm here all day. Oh, God! I told myself I wasn't going to do this. Don't be a stranger, hmm? This is always home for you. Thank you. You'll always be a big part of my life. - Hi, Lindsey. - Hi. - I guess about an hour? - That sounds good. I'll be back. Hi, Elyse, I'm Lindsey. I'm going to help you walk today. I'm going to put one hand on each rest here. Good. And now, lean forward and push up to stand. And now let me have you take some steps forward. You're doing great. - Hello, Mrs. Madison. - Hello, dear. Oh, sweetheart. You look so beautiful. Your hair's getting long. And you're finally wearing that sweater I bought you in Italy. It's one hundred percent cashmere. And I have another surprise for you. Wait till you see it. Now stand. Let's stand. Come on. Walk to the bed. Walk to the bed. Today is the first day she's walking. It's great. It's a miracle. I have a surprise for you. Look. Ta-da! Lip gloss. Mascara. Moisturizer. And these little clips for your hair. There it is. Let mother freshen you up. Yes. Oh. So beautiful. You never need much. I'm so happy to see you're feeling better. - And soon we'll be going to occupational therapy. - Oh! Where you can draw, 'cause I hear you're an amazing artist. She is a magnificent artist. You need to get some rest. Oh, I love you. Goodbye, dear. I know Elyse appreciates your visits. What a sweet woman. You're not going to believe what I did last night. I adopted this little guy, Elyse. You like cats? Do you have a cat? No? You don't have a cat? Well, I haven't named him yet. Maybe you can help me. 'Cause I was thinking of, uh, Chianti. What do you think? You don't like Chianti. That's okay. How about Bordeaux? Bordeaux? Bordeaux it is. Here's your book, Elyse. Here, let's finish this drawing. Let go. Okay. Perfect. I'll be over there, okay? Do you want to finish your artwork today? - Hi, Natalia. - What do you want? I'll be in the other room. I want paint with you. I'm artist. Okay, come on. Finish your painting. - Why you no talk? - Jen? - I want paint with you. I want paint with you! I'm artist! - That's enough. Why you no talk? You my friend. You my friend. We should talk, my friend. Elyse? Everything okay, Elyse? Everything okay? Is this rain? No? Would you like a walk instead? Yes? Yes? Okay. Okay. Let's go. Okay, let's go. Let's go for a walk. I go there as often as possible throughout the day. I love California light. There's something that I find very moving about it. In some sort of way, it reminds me of my, uh, childhood in France. My mom left to the US when I was eight to give us a better life. So my grandmother raised me. And for years I resented her for doing this. For leaving me. Parents do the best they can. Deep down they all love their children. And we can't forget that once upon a time they were children themselves. Who knows what they went through? I've come to terms with my past. We better go. You have an appointment with Doctor Lewis now. Good. Elyse. Good morning. Sit down, please. - Good. - Elyse? Please have a seat. Okay. - I'll be outside, Doctor. - No, I want you to stay. Close the door. I want you to stay because she seems more responsive when she's with you. Elyse? Hello. You remember me? Yes. Can you tell me where you are? This room. Your surroundings. Good. Can you tell me verbally where you are? All right. Now, I know you're a very good artist. I'm going to give you a pad and paper and a pen. I want you to draw for me your surroundings of where you are. Free association. - What's that? - She's drawing the view from the atrium. Uh-huh. And my cat. She likes my cat Bordeaux. You bring your cat to work? No, no, Doctor. I show her photos. Yeah. You can take the pad from her. Good. Elyse? Do you know that you're in the Lennox State Hospital? Do you understand? Uh, patients with catatonia, many make good progress with ECT treatment. Now, you've been here, just over six months. You've made minimal progress. But I'm a little concerned, because I want to bring you totally out of this condition. You understand me? Look at me. Tell me. Have we got a deal? I'm so happy to see you doing so well. You look pretty when you smile. You know that, right? Can you excuse us? - Can you excuse us? - Yes. Yes. - But I can't leave her alone. - I don't give a fuck! I've called Doctor Lewis and you several times in the last few weeks. Why doesn't anyone have the courtesy to return my calls? I've tried calling you several and your voicemail's always full. That's bullshit! You can call my office. I'll be... I'll be nearby. I saw your face. Like you don't have a care in the world. And then you see me and it's a different face. A face of misery and death. That's what I see when I look in your eyes. Death. I haven't slept at the house in months. I am selling it. Listen to these words, Elyse. I don't know what life has in store for you. But I am done. Elyse, how are you feeling? Patient remains in a state of severe catatonia. It's been one year today. And Mr. Bridges, since your last visit, your wife has suffered a relapse or a setback. And up until that point we were making fair progress. So, as you can imagine, we are rather disappointed and frustrated. Thank you. What happened? What do you mean what happened? I don't know who you are! I don't know who your daughter is! I'm a stranger in this family. I've always made myself available to you, Steven. Why didn't you call me? What's wrong? What are you going to give me to take the place of my son? Nothing will bring him back! Nothing! Hold on one second. Hey, Steven. It's the office. This is our family time! What the fuck is she still doing in our house? - You know what? - She's supposed to be here. - You can fuck her if you want! - Elyse! Stop it! You can fuck her all you want! I'm fucking over it! You can have her! I'm out of here! Fuck you! I have nightmares. Seeing his dead body covered in blood. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Calling Dr. Lewis to room 333. Calling Dr. Lewis to room 333. I'm sorry. I should have told you I was coming. - It's okay. - She knows you're here. Come speak to her. I woke up this morning feeling it was time to come see you. On the way here, I stopped by the cemetery and put flowers for my mother. It's their anniversary. I don't know if I'm imagining this, but I feel my mother is by my side. She's with me everywhere I go. It gives me great comfort. You know... time? Time is compassionate. It has a way of healing us. Dearest, Steven. Yesterday I saw you and your family at the Malibu Christmas Tree Shop. I didn't say hello. I felt it was inappropriate. Congratulations, your daughter is beautiful. I married David five years ago. He's very kind to me. We live a simple life. My mother is now in a home for assisted living. She turned eighty-eight last week. We had a little party for her. She's very frail. I go see her once in a while, but she doesn't recognize me. No idea who I am. Strange, isn't it? Life. Be well. My love always, Elyse.
