(dramatic music) (smooth music) (brooding synth music) - On the 14th day of the present lunar month, a girl of pale complexion and tender years shall come to you. In her, you shall see the fulfillment of all your years of longing, all your years of searching for the perfect mate. Only when you are bound together in blood can you take your rightful place at the left hand of the most high. In the beginning, it was preordained that every 1000 years when Saturn is in conjunction with the sun and Mars is in the fifth house, only in this precise moment in astral time can this union take place. Even now, there dwells within your house one who knows of this woman. Through him, you shall procure. Through him (moves into tense music) shall she come willing to you. Oh, Lord Rakeesh, come to us. - [All] Guide our hand, oh Lord Rakeesh. - [Priestess] Lord Rakeesh, come to us. - [All] Lord Rakeesh, come to us. - [Priestess] Lord Rakeesh, come to us. - [All] Lord Rakeesh, come to us. - [Priestess] Strengthen the power of the master. - [All] Lord Rakeesh, come to us. - Blood of my blood, flesh of my spirits. This we offer you, master of the high. In this, we worship you. Blood of my blood, flesh of my spirits. This we offer you, oh master of the high. In this, we worship you, oh Lord Rakeesh. (moves into uneasy synth music) - Here comes the booze. Arthur. - Thank you. - [Maya] Here you are. - Thank you, love. That dinner was delicious, and so are you. - [Maya] George, stop that. - [Arthur] Now, this, I envy you. - What, feeling my behind? - (laughs) Oh no, no, not that, though I must bow to George's good taste. It's this. An excellent meal and a beautiful and charming wife. - How about sexy? - [Arthur] Yes, and that too. - So what are you waiting for? Honestly, it doesn't make sense, Arthur. You give up everything, you go off to god knows where to do god knows what. Listen, I really need you. The office isn't the same without you. - George, George, there are 100 mechanics that can take my place. You don't need me. - Will you listen to him, Maya? Mechanic. You're an architect, man, and a damn good one. I wouldn't mind if you were going on to something meaningful. - Don't be so obstinate, George. Arthur has his own life and I'm sure he has his own reasons. - Well, I'll buy that, but what? (scoffs) I mean, Christ, Arthur, you're too old to be a high school dropout. Now what is it? - You believe in God? - Religion, didn't I tell you he's flipping his cork? Okay, I believe in God, but don't tell me you're going to run off to a monastery and become a monk or something. - Now George, don't be so obstinate. Arthur has his own life and I'm sure he has his own reasons. - If you believe in God, a supreme being, a power, then you must also believe in a force equal to his, a power equal to him. Then you must also believe in the devil. - The devil? (scoffs) - And witches and goblins and things that go bump in the night, huh? - That too. At this very moment, there are forces at work. Perhaps right now there's a messenger moving, gliding, reaching out for us. - Oh. Maya, I think you'd better get Arthur another drink. He needs it. (droning synth music) (uneasy synth music) - George. Love me? - I do, darling. - Always? Will you love me always? - Yes, I love you, Maya, always. - I wish I were well. You know, a little more passion. I just wanna please you. - You do, my darling. I wouldn't change you for anything. You're my life. I love you. - Oh, George. Do you want to kiss me? Kiss me. I feel a chill. I need you, really. (intense synth music) - Give me the photograph. - Yes, Dr. Muldavo. She's very beautiful. - Perfect. Perfect. Did you hear me, Aurielia? I said she's perfect. Here, look. What is it? Don't you want to see the woman chosen for me? What are you thinking, Aurielia? You wouldn't try to destroy me, would you, Aurielia? Not out of petty jealousy. (tense synth music) See, you little fool, each day its power lessens as I grow stronger. Soon I will be free of this threat. It is written, it is inevitable. You're right, Aurielia. I should not play or antagonize with this power. It is time for Arthur. I have no time for you right now. Maybe a little later. (uneasy synth music) (moves into dramatic synth music) Having a good time tonight, Arthur? - (laughs) Yes. - You have friends here. You know that, don't you, Arthur? - [Arthur] Yes. But you have other friends, friends outside of here. We'll have a costume party. I want you to invite George and Maya, and bring them here. Enjoy yourself, Arthur. (tense synth music) (chanting in foreign language) (grunting and breathing heavily) (whimpering) (chanting in foreign language) - Come, come. (moaning) Yeah, yeah. (moaning) (fire crackling) Yeah. - Come, oh. No, yeah, no. (moaning and breathing heavily) Oh. Oh, yeah. - [George] Wake up, wake up, wake up. - George, hold me. Hold me. - It's okay. It's all over, honey, you're safe. - I feel so strange. I don't know what it is. - It's just a dream, Maya, you're all right, it's all over. - I know. A dream. Nothing more. I was somewhere else. I had this feeling. Burning, here. Hold your hand there. You feel the warmth? George. George. George, I need you. Not like before, I need you, I need you to get it out of me. George. (moaning) George, George, get it out of me. I know you can. Oh yeah. (George grunting) (Maya grunts) (George screams) (Maya crying) - [George] Honey, what is it? What's the matter, honey? - [Maya] I don't know, I don't know. - [George] Honey, what's the matter? Baby. - [Maya] I don't know what's wrong. - [George] Come on, relax. - Honestly George, can't we ever make love without your thinking there's something wrong? - What the hell is with you anyway? Christ, look what you've done to my chest. - Oh, poor baby. Let me kiss away the boo boo. (tense music) - Honey, will you listen to me? Maya? Honey, I wanna know what's wrong. You haven't said anything to me all day. For the love of god, will you please tell me what you're thinking? (Maya laughs) - It's insane. - What's insane? - What I'm thinking. - Well, what are you thinking about? - Cherry pie. - All right. What are you thinking about cherry pie? - It looks like blood. Don't you think it looks like blood? - No, I think it looks like cherry pie. - Now, now doesn't it look like blood? - [George] No, it looks like mashed up cherry pie. - Now look what you made me do. I suppose you're gonna say this doesn't look like real blood. - No, it looks like real blood. Honey, what? - [Maya] You made me cut myself, now lick it off. - If I live to be 100, I'll never understand you. - Just do it, George. Don't spoil it with questions. Here's some more. (phone rings) Hello? Arthur, how strange to hear from you. I had a dream about you last night. Well, actually he's busy just now, but I can take a message for him. How fantastic, a costume party? Well, who is this friend of yours? I see. Well, of course we'll go if it's that important to you. Of course. How fantastic, a real chauffeured limousine and the costumes thrown in to boot. (laughs) Well, of course we'll come. Yes, eight o'clock, then. Eight o'clock, right. Goodbye. You hurt my finger. That was Arthur on the phone. - Why did you hang up? I wanted to talk to him. - We'll see him tonight. He invited us to a costume party and I said we'd go. Some friend of his in the country. He supplies the costumes and the transportation. - And it's just the kind of thing that really annoys me, honey. You didn't even ask me, and who the hell is giving this party? - I wanna go, George. Arthur said it was important to him. - Since when are you so concerned about what Arthur wants? Besides, you don't even like parties. - I wanna go, George, I don't know why. - What do you mean you don't know why? (whimpers) - I've got to get out of this place, do you understand? I've gotta get out of here. Why do you keep hounding me like this? Why do you keep hounding me? - [George] I'm sorry, baby. (sobbing) Honey, I'm sorry. Of course we'll go. Come on, honey, I'm sorry. We'll go, okay, huh? Maya? Okay? (uneasy synth music) (gasps) - For god's sakes, George, you scared the life out of me. - I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean to sneak up on you. Forgive me? - Yes, of course. I guess I'm a little edgy. - Doesn't matter. Listen, it's getting late. This chauffeur's gonna be here any minute. - George, I don't wanna go. I'm afraid. - [George] For god's sake, honey, I just don't believe it. (Maya sighs) - I don't know, I don't know what's wrong with me. I just haven't been able to get enough sleep lately since I've had these headaches. Oh George. (sighs) I'm sorry. Of course we'll go. - Okay, we'll do whatever you wanna do. I just want you to be happy, huh? But would you please make up your mind? (phone rings) Maybe the chauffeur was delayed, huh? - Maybe. - Hello? (tense synth music) Hello? Listen, I can hear you breathing, damn it, now what do you want? Who is this? Go to hell, would you? - [Muldavo] Who were you calling, Arthur? - No one, I just-- - [Muldavo] Were you perhaps calling Maya? - She wouldn't understand. She's not one of us. - You pitiful worm under my feet. You dare thwart me. - [Arthur] No, maestro, I live just for you. - No living thing on this Earth shall stand before me and the fulfillment of my destiny. - [Arthur] Please, master, please forgive me. - Go and wait for me below. I will punish you later. - [Arthur] Master, please, master. - Go, you slime, or I will cut you dead where you lay. - Look, master. (whimpering) Master. (uneasy synth music) (screaming) - Slowly. Not too quickly. Arthur is much too precious to be wasted so quickly. - George? - Hmm? - Am I a good wife? - What do you mean? Of course you're a good wife. - I mean, do you think I'm too cold or something like that? (George laughs) Do you think I could be a little sexier? - I thoughth you were very sexy this afternoon. I've got the scars to prove it. - Yeah, but usually, usually. Don't you think I'm too cold? - Gee, I don't know. Maybe sometimes, a little. - George? - Hmm? - Oh, nothing. What time is it? - Oh, just about 8:30. - I can hardly wait. How far is it now? - We're almost there, we're approaching it now. I've put your costume in your room. I hope they fit. - You truly are a queen, my Maya. The gods have chosen wisely. Soon I will taste you. Then we shall see. You're almost too silent, Aurielia. (sighs) Come now, my pretty. We must get ready. Tonight must be the night to end all nights. Arthur? What of Arthur? You fool. 1000 years of destiny have led me to this moment and he would dare to defy me. No. No, he must die. And you, my pretty little animal, it's best now you start thinking of your own skin. I wouldn't want to punish you. - Well, what do you think? - [George] Well, it is a bit abbreviated. - I kind of like it. It's got character. - I just don't understand you, honey. (Maya laughs) - [Maya] It's just perfect. You'll look real cute in that. (laughs) - Clothes make the man. (Maya laughs) - George. - [George] What, honey? - George, I love you. - I love you too, darling. - I guess I've been kind of out of it the past few days. - I know, but I love you anyway. - This may sound funny, but I never realized until just now how much I really love you. (knocking) - Compliments of Dr. Muldavo to take the edge off your trip. - How thoughtful of him, George. Isn't it thoughtful of him? - Yes, very. - Thank you. - Thank you. To us, and to tonight. - Mm, it's delicious. It sort of makes you feel giddy. - It's very good but it has a strange bouquet. - It's grown here on the estate. The recipe has been in the family for years. I trust I'll see you later tonight. - Yes, of course. - [Women] Maya. Maya. Maya. Maya. Maya. (manic synth music) (Maya gasps) - How strange. Where am I? - Here. We've been waiting for you. - And George, where is George? - (laughs) He's here too. Come, with the others. - And you, who are you? - [Women] Maya. - Your eyes-- - [Women] Maya. - And your wit. - [Women] Maya. - Come. - Maya - Maya. Maya, Maya. Maya, Maya. Maya, Maya, Maya. Maya, Maya. Maya. - They seem to know me. - [Man] Of course they do. After all, you are the-- - Why do they do that? - [Women] Maya. - [Man] The blood? - [Maya] Yes. - [Man] It excites them. - [Maya] But doesn't it hurt? - No, a small amount of pain is soon forgotten as the pledge-- - When? - Soon, he waits for you. - Will you leave me? - Yes. Come. - Maya. Maya. - All you must do is cross into the light. There, you will find him. Look. (uneasy synth music) - [Muldavo] I am Dr. Muldavo. - Yes, I know. We've never met but somehow I feel as though I know you. - You, my little Maya, there is so much we must find out about each other. - There's time enough, really, we have all night. - You're right, of course. Time is irrelevant. 1000 years can be pressed into a few seconds, and seconds ticking away can seem an eternity. - There's some sort of strange bond between us, isn't there? I feel as though I should go, but somehow I-- - Stay, I want you to stay, Maya. I want you to take my hand. You and I, here, now. This moment is not by chance. - But George, what of him? - The world is full of Georges. They are but a heartbeat in eternity. Take my hand. (moves into tense synth music) - [Maya] Heaven help me. I've committed myself, but to what? - To me, my life. I was signed. You will glory in my power. (uneasy synth music) - [Maya] I-- - Don't talk, don't speak. There is no need for words. I need another commitment from you. When I was a young man, life held nothing for me. I neither loved, nor was I loved. Each day was no different than the day before. I reached out for anything, a distraction, perhaps, to get me out. They found me. A world with men who, like I, would dare to defy convention, who would enter into darkness in order to see light. For, you see, to live, you must drink life, that fluid which rushes through each of us, that life fluid which exceeds all thirst awakens in me a hunger for the dark, the forbidden. It took possession of me. I was freed, and I thirsted for a power that few may never dream of. - [Maya] You frighten me. I want to be free too but I don't understand. - You see only what you want to see, hear only what you want to hear. - [Women] Maya. - Listen. - [Women] Maya. - See. - Maya. - The air is filled with demons. - Maya. - Charged with demons. - Maya, Maya. - I have raised them. - Maya, Maya. - They are my power. - Maya. Maya. - Each act of horror you will see here is rushing in, homage to their magnificence. - [Women] Maya. - Listen to them. - Maya. - Listen. - Maya. - What do they say to you? - [Women] Maya. - What do they say? - [Women] Maya. Maya, Maya. Maya, Maya, Maya. (dramatic synth music) (Maya breathing heavily) (chanting in foreign language) - Lord Rakeesh, welcome your daughter, queen of the most high. Sanctified in union, give them the power to serve you. Give them the power to reign over all of darkness throughout all of eternity. - Now, now I am fulfilled. Now my true destiny is at hand. Oh Lord Rakeesh, I, your most obedient servant, pledge to you my undying devotion to your will. What grand and glorious sacrifices shall I lay before your mantles. Who is it? You dare to interrupt this ceremony? Kill him, cut him down. You, Aurielia. You would do this to me. Your justice will come sooner than expected. (shrill dramatic music) Hear me, oh Lord Rakeesh. Strike him, he who would defy me. Take the power from his arms. (screams) Oh Lord, do not desert me now. (speaking foreign language) (tense synth music) - George, wait. - What is it? Come on, let's get out of here. - I can't go on, I have to rest. Besides, we keep going around in circles. - Okay, honey, okay, you rest, but let's get out of here, huh? - George, will you put that damn thing down? - [George] What? - They'll see us, and besides, it's hurting my eyes. - Okay, all right. (grunting) - Kill him. Kill him. Where is he? - [Carlos] Not too far, my queen. Come, we must hurry. - And the others? - They're of no use. She's the only one that is of any use now, come. (uneasy synth music) Master, can you walk? - Yes, help me. You must leave. - [Carlos] Where, where can we go? - Anywhere, doesn't matter, anywhere. (uneasy synth music) - [Muldavo] Tell me. - No, it's nothing. It'll pass. - I cannot feel, I grow weak. I admit it. Is it real life? - No, it's nothing. It will pass. - Where have I failed him? Why has he deserted me? - A test, nothing more. You'll see. - There must be an answer to something. Don't just sit there. Do something. (uneasy synth music) - There must be another way. - [Maya] There is no other way. - But why this? I don't think I can do it. - Do you question me? - [Woman] No. - Then do it. - Carlos, sit down over there. - The master, how is the master? - [Maya] He grows worse. - But surely there must be something we can do. - Yes, there is one thing, and I've chosen you for it. - Tell me, I will do anything. - Yes, I know. The answer must lie in blood. He needs a great deal of blood, and soon. - (sighs) It will not be easy, but it can be done. - Yes. Do it now. (shrill tense music) Hurry, we must not waste any of it. (tense synth music) Now? - Better. - [Maya] The pain? - Better. How much blood is left? (sighs) - That was the last. - [Muldavo] I need more. - Yes, I know. Let me see your face. - [Muldavo] Must you? - The bandage, I have to change the bandage. Change your clothes, we must go out. - Why? - [Maya] He needs more blood. - I cannot. - He will die. - He will die anyway. There's been enough killing, enough blood. Look at my hands. - What? - The blood. I washed them, it won't come off. - Go and wash them again. This time it will come off. (dramatic synth music) (knife thudding) - [Muldavo] It cannot end like this. - No, there's still hope. - No. Not even death. He is family and I have failed you. - No, no. No, you haven't. We can. - No. Time is gone and my chest, (rasping) can't breathe. Choking. My, my... (sobbing) - Hear me, oh Lord Rakeesh. Do not desert him. Bring him back to me so that we may both serve him. Give me your son. If this be not your will, then let me join him. Give me your son. (uneasy synth music)
