Erna, are you ready? Just a minute. Adil! Adil! "Surau Dan Silek" Adil. Dayat. Kurip. Losing because of being cheated... ...is not a disgrace. But if you'd hit him when I shouted at you, he would've been knocked out. As your uncle, Adil, I was so embarrassed that people made fun of me at the stall. Uncle Rustam. Adhan. We'll do it later. Isha has the longest time. Up until dawn. Now, you listen to me. Well, well, well. Great, Rustam. Don't you hear the adhan? No wonder these kids always lose. You don't pray? I don't think you should. Go, go, go! Do your prayer! -Hey, you come with me. -Do your prayer. Can't you tell the difference between the school and the arena? If you do it this way, you don't need to go to school. You can be menacing debt collectors at the markets. Now go to the backyard. Clean it up while memorizing Ash-Shams. Understand? -Yes. -Yes, sir. Take it easy. You don't have to be like that. Hardi, why did you spray rice bran into my face? Wasn't there any way to win that your teacher taught you? What bran? Where did we compete? Not in the rice mill. In the sport hall! It was obvious that you sprayed bran into my face. You said no. You don't need to make excuses. Just admit that you lost. Pray to God that you will get to the final next semester. We'll meet again. Eat that. The Dutch accusation that Haji Agus Salim... ...had collected de jure international support ilegally... ...is wrong. In my opinion, that was his responsibility as a Foreign Minister. That's all from me. Thank you. Dayat. Dayat, wait! What's up, Rani? Dayat, why did Adil and Hardi have a fight? About Adil? Adil lost the fight in the arena. Maybe he couldn't take it. But Adil wasn't injured, was he? No, but he lost. Thank you, Dayat. Rani... -Where are you going? -Home. -Let's go together. -No. You had a fight, didn't you? What? How did you know? Aunt Rabiah. Everyone at school saw it she said. Don't confuse school and arena, Son. People will think I don't teach you. Right, Mom. It was all because of my friend. I was cheated in the competition. Ida... Ida... Yes, Aunt. Alhamdulillah, Adil. Haji Asni gave us some alms from her successful children in the city. We take alms, Mom? We belong the group of asnaf of the eight. Really, Mom? You have me. I am healthy. I can help you make some money. You just go to school. When you grow up, make me some money. Aunt, three noodles, five eggs, please. Well, well, well. Come home from the big city, and you can only afford to buy noodle. Irman, is life so hard in the city? Cibia and Buya Rustam. No, I just miss this noodle. It's not easy to find it in the city. What do you do now, Rustam? Now I'm concentrating on my silat academy. Well, that's great, Rustam. How many students have you got? Plenty. I have plenty. But now I'm concentrating on finding tough generation. So, I'm a little bit picky. Alhamdulillah. There's only three boys now. Irman, why are you home? I'm home just for a while. I missed my parents. Okay, I'll cook this noodle now. -Assalamu'alaikum. -Wa'alaikumussalam. Use a lot of water, Irman. It'll make you full. Aunt. What's Irman doing in the city? He could just afford to buy noodle. What a pity. I learned that he... ...he works at the British Embassy. -Assalamu'alaikum. -Wa'alaikumussalam. What are you thinking about, Son? Mom. Can I take some rendang with me to the city? Why do you want to go to the city now? I feel embarrassed living in this village, Mom. Whenever there is someone from the city, I don't know what to say. Irman, who was nobody when we were kids, is now working in England. Nobody goes to live in the city because of feeling embarrassed, Son. You said before that you didn't want to go to the city... ...because you wanted to teach Adil and his friends silat. You said you felt sorry for Adil... ...because you're his only uncle to replace his father. Yes, Mom. But you know. Those kids keep losing. My skill? You know my skill. It has become a burden for me, Mom. If the kids still want to learn silat, they can find other teachers. Let's have dinner. Okay, Mom. Hubby... Hubby... Hang it up, Hubby. -There. Yes. -Okay. Like this? Very nice. Uncle, let's practice. Wait a minute. Come on. Get ready. In position. What is our new move now, Uncle? Our new move now is how to run fast... ...when your opponent is after you. I'm serious. Come on. In position. "Silat Practice Schedule" "Silat Practice Schedule" Hey, Dayat! Hurry up! Uncle Rustam has been waiting! I only have this much now, Sister. -Assalamu'alaikum. -Wa'alaikumussalam. Inshallah I'll pay the rest soon, Sister. Okay, please make it soon, Ida. Yes, Sister. Have a drink. "MDA-TPA Surau Labuah Panampuang" Dayat, lend me 2.000 rupiah. He'll call my name soon. Adil. Thank you. I'll pay you back later, but with marbles. -But a sack of them. -Why so many? To hit Hardi's head. Thank God, Rustam finally went to live in the city. Eat that, Cibia. Whom do you have left to hang out with in this village? That's good for him, rather than just fooling around in this village. What would he do here? He taught silat, but we have no idea what sort of silat he taught. The kids just followed. He's your friend, isn't he, Cibia? Just a minute, Uncle. Cibia, Cibia... Have you heard? Rustam has gone to the city. He went to live in the city. Grandma! Grandma! Where has Uncle Rustam gone? I thought you knew. Rustam left this morning. He acted as if he's not going anywhere. Why did he leave? Who is going to teach us? Let him go to learn and live in the city. So he can be a proper teacher for the children in this village later. Hey! Who is going to teach you silat now? -Why don't you try me? -Don't be shooty, Hardi. You want to be in the competition. How can you win if you have no teacher? Rather than losing badly, it'd be better for Adil not to register at all. Pull yourself together, Adil. Why so emotional? If we hadn't been separated, I would have kicked your butt. Pull yourself together, Adil. Kurip. Kurip. It's just my move. You don't want to try Adil's. Kurip. Kurip, wake up. Kurip. You talk too much. Kurip. Wake up, Kurip. Kurip. Hei. Hei. Kurip. Wake up. -He's gone? -Yes. Don't fight again, Adil. Do you remember what Grandpa Haji said at your dad's funeral? There are only three things that we take with us when we're dead. First, useful knowledge. Charity. And a prayer from a pious child. The first two things were your dad's responsibility. I rely on you for the third. That's what I'm trying to do, Mom. But it's hard. It's difficult to be good. When we're trying to be nice, people are mean to us. To even the score, we have to be bad. If you want your dad to be peaceful up there, you have to be good and always send him prayer. Okay? Hubby. This fish is from Yen's fish pond. Hubby. Have you finished your writing for tomorrow? Someone called and he was laughing hard... ...reading your article in the paper. He said, "Where Di he get the idea to say that PNS... ...is a Non-Stop Broker?" "How come he takes a politician for a broker?" Typical. If you're guilty, you'll be offended. If not, it's okay. Hey. I've finished my writing so we can relax tomorrow. Where do you want to go? Rahmat's Mom said next month... ...the five graders will go on a study tour? It's mainly a tour, Mom. Studying is just a bonus. You want to join them, Adil? We'll see, Mom. You're still using that old Mercy. It's a long way from Yogyakarta. I salute you. We took it slowly, Brother. We couldn't force it. The car and the people are just the same. Have you two been long in this village? It's been two years. So... Jufriadi and his wife got a scholarship to Manchester. Their daughter was still young, at the third grade. So, I suggested... ...that their children should not go with them that far. So, we decided to go home. His daughter goes to school here. That's good, Brother. So she'll know her ancestor's homeland. -Assalamu'alaikum. -Wa'alaikumussalam. This is Rani, our granddaughter. -She is Jufriadi's daughter? -Yes. So beautiful. As beautiful as her grandma when she was young, right? -Are you also a teacher? -Yes. That's right. Before becoming a lecturer, Mr Johar was an honorary teacher in Seremban. Then, he came home to Indonesia and became an accomplished lecturer... ...that he received an award from the UNESCO. Low profile, willing to come home. That's the difference between going to live in the city... ...and "marantau cino". What is "marantau cino", Grandma? "Marantau cino" is going to the city without bothering to go back home. Hey. By the way, the competition day is getting closer. Our skill is still the same. We still have some drawbacks. Foreign relation! What's that? We go out of this village to find a silat teacher. Wow, that's great. Let's get our bicycles. If dream is a challenge Then face it With all your might If dream is a song Then sing it Together Our dream lies ahead Let's keep fighting for it Be brave That's Rani. -Really? -Yes. Where have you been, Rani? I was from science course. You? Finding a silat teacher. Jeez, so far away. It's alright. We're giving it a shot. Bye, now. -Need a lift? -No, I'll take the bus. -Here you are, Adil. -Thank you. It should be for me. Wear it. Can never be stopped If you're here, always with me Rest assured, we'll conquer the world Let it out, express what's in your heart Spill it out, and keep on running Together, we're going to make Our dream comes true Our dream lies ahead Let's keep fighting for it Be brave, let's make it happen If we could stick together There's gotta be a way And we're gonna make Our dream comes true Our dream comes true Our dream comes true Hei, what's the smell? It's incense. Is it alright? Hey, you behind the bush. Come here! This is the most formidable silat school in the whole Luhak Nan Tujuah. There have been many great warriors from this school. Can you mention an example, Sir? I don't need to tell you. How can we train here, Sir? Bring a black chicken with a broken leg, one-eyed duck, and rusty scissors. Why is it so complicated, Sir? Where can we find... ...a chicken with a broken leg... ...and one-eyed duck? That's the requirement from this school. Alright, Sir. We happen to live far from here. We'll bring the requirement tomorrow, Sir. -Assalamu'alaikum, Sir. -Assalamu'alaikum, Sir. Adil, don't leave me! One more village, Rip. I'm exhausted. Let's do our prayer. We skipped Asr prayer. -That's because of the devil school. -Right. We forgot to perform prayer. Let's do it later. I have to help my mom bring the fabric tonight. And you, Dayat. How can you perform prayer? You just wet your pants. Hei, Adil, are you afraid of your mom or God? Kids, can you help me get my sandals? Let's go. Hey. -Have you performed your prayer? -We will, Sir. Alright. I'm going. -Let's take ablution. -Okay, and then perform our prayer. -Change your pants into sarong. -Alright! Hey, Adil. What's up, Rani? I didn't see your name on the teacher's list for the study tour. I might not go, Rani. I get sick easily on the bus. What's gonna happen if our friends go on the study tour, Adil? I can ask Dayat, Kurip and you. -Alright. -Have you taken ablution? -Yes. -Let's go and pray. Okay. -Rivo! -Present, Ma'am. -Fikri! -Present, Ma'am. -Hardi. -Present, Ma'am. -Rian. -Present. -Najwa! -Present. -Kurip. -Present, Ma'am. -Dayat! -Present, Ma'am. -Adil! -He's not here, Ma'am. He gets sick easily. He hasn't got any money, Ma'am. Now get in the bus. The boys first. Why aren't you going on the study tour, Adil? I get sick easily, Uncle. Moreover, I'm helping you now, Uncle. Wait here, Adil. I've got to go. -Okay, Uncle. -Here's for you. -Thank you, Sir. -You're welcome, Adil. The mountain so high The mountain, so very high Come on, let's climb - Bye, Adil! - Bye, Adil! Adil. Adil. Hey. Hey. Well, are you not going? Turns out that we also get sick easily. -Assalamu'alaikum. -Wa'alaikumussalam. This is to pay your debt to Aunt Risma. Why aren't you in school, Adil? They're going on a study tour, Mom. You really didn't go? Even though I didn't go with them, this world is wide enough for me to study, Mom. I'm going to Uncle Ujang's place, Mom. I have work to do. -Don't forget to pray, Adil. -Yes, Mom. It's not good Don't eat that. This little Adil is so unfortunate No father to love him No money to please him Yet, this little Adil Has a really strong heart Problems are nothing to him This little Adil doesn't give up He looks at the world with high hope Troubles never let him be But he always stays happy Where are you taking these, Sir? To Pekanbaru. These are for you. Thank you, Sir. -Fry them when you get home. -Okay, Sir. This little Adil doesn't give up He looks at the world with high hope Troubles never let him be But he always stays happy It's fun to kick in the water. It's heavy inside and light on the outside. Can you try it, Dayat? By the way, when will we go finding a silat teacher? Look, Adil. I don't think we need to force ourselves to join the competition. What did you say? Say it again! So, this is what silat means for you. Go on learning until everyone is scared of you. Kurip and Dayat, Mom... They won't find a silat teacher. Why? I don't know, Mom. Kurip, wait! What is it, Rani? Why don't the three of you get together anymore? We are not on speaking term at the moment, Rani. Adil insisted on joining the tournament. We don't have a teacher, no new move. I don't think we should join the tournament just to lose. Isn't there any other way? We'll see. What are you reading, Kurip? Civic book. We will have daily quiz tomorrow. Hey, Dayat. Hurry up. What's the matter with you, Dayat? "Invitation" Adil. Adil. Adil. It's alright to have an argument with friends. But don't get carried away. Sit together and talk it over, okay? What do you think about Ustad Jefri's sermon? Johar. Malin. -It's been a long time. -Indeed. -How are you? -We're happy you're home. So you threw away your bamboo toy gun? I keep it at home. I have good news for you. Next week... ...our school is organizing a competition. Subjects for the competition will be mathematics, art, science and social science. Those who pass the school selection... ...will continue to the town level. Alhamdulillah, our school is hosting the event this year. You're still awake, Kurip? Yes, Dad. This is a good book. Brother Ed lent me. -What book is that? -A history book, Dad. Alright. Read it, but don't think too hard. -Come on, get some sleep. -In a moment, Dad. He's great. I'm not sure he can. We'll see. Hurry. Wonderful. Grandpa. My friends want to learn silat. But their teacher has gone to live in the city. I'd like to help them. But... ...I don't know how. Do you still remember Mr. Johar who came over before? -The retired lecturer? -Yes. He was a warrior in Kampung Bancah. He's an expert on religion and culture. But... ...is he willing to teach? He said he didn't want to do it anymore. Let's give it a try, Grandpa. We go and see Mr. Johar now. So, Rani, as I see it, people learn silat now just to fight. It's different, Sir. My friends do not fight and they are not crooks. They just want to win a tournament, Sir. That's it. If it's just to win a tournament, if silat is just to win a tournament, there may be many schools of silat in this village. So, I'd suggest... ...that your friends take up other hobbies. You mean playing PlayStation and online game? -That's not what I mean. -Aren't you happy... ...to see children of my age learning our own culture? Moreover, I know that you were a warrior in Kampung Bancah. At the moment, I might not be ready, Rani. If you're not ready, we can wait. But, don't take it too long, Sir. Agreed, Sir? Sir? -Grandpa, let's go home. -Okay. I'm gonna go. -Your tea. -Thank you. Why don't you teach those kids silat? They take up silat just to show off. So, I think there's no use. I think... ...we should be grateful that there are kids who want to learn silat. Yes. We should be grateful. -But... -One more thing, Hubby. What would you say when Allah asks about useful knowledge? Alright, you've been a lecturer. You've taught many people. But for the kids in this village? We have no children. We have no children who would send us prayers when we're dead. In fact, it can be our new field of good deed, Hubby. Please, think it over. -May I borrow, please? -No. Don't be stingy! Where is Adil? -Over there. -Call him! Adil! Wait. Adil! -What's going on, Rani? -About the silat teacher. I've found him. He was a warrior. You'd better meet him yourself. How can we meet him? Well, at least for me. For us too, right, Rip? -We'll go to his house. -Okay. Where is he? Where is he? It's hot here. What takes him so long? It's hot. Can't you be more patient? Here he comes. -Assalamu'alaikum, Sir. -Wa'alaikumussalam. What's up? These are my friends who want to learn silat, Sir. Sir, we met at the surau. Really? I can't remember. We were looking for a school of silat. -Yes. -But we couldn't find one, Sir, because one was very expensive, and one was like a devil school. That's right, Sir. Too expensive, 250.000 rupiah. So, why do you want to learn silat? I have to win the tournament, Sir. I was cheated by Hardi. As for me, I want to lose weight, Sir. So that... ...Rani likes me, Sir. For me, I just want to complete my self defence, Sir, because I really don't like fighting. Hubby, Kids, let's go and talk inside. I've made some drinks. It's okay here. Now I want to know. Do you pray five times a day? Salah, salawat, and silat. The three of them always go together. You can't exclude one of them. If you want to learn silat, you should pray five times a day. Do you understand? I thought you were pious boys. It turns out you're no different. You learn silat just to be tough guys. And you, Fat Dayat. Don't be bothered hoping for me to like you. What a pity. -What a pity. -What a pity. So, how is it, Hubby? -What's that? -The kids. I actually really miss... ...the atmosphere of silat and surau. That's why I'm willing to come home and write a book about that. If you miss it, what are you waiting for? Their motivation. It's obvious from what they said. So they don't need to learn silat. But they're just kids, Hubby. Here's when your role comes to play. How to make them understand what silat is really like. Moreover, we're getting old. What else can we do than doing more good deeds? Do you still remember three things that count when we're dead? Charity, useful knowledge, and prayer from pious kids. We don't have the third, Hubby. So, you should teach them like your own kids. With God's blessing, their prayers may help us later. You write the theory in your book. And you practice with them. If... ...I knew silat, I would teach those kids. Is it necessary for me to get dirty? Hubby. -Mr. Johar. -Mr. Johar. Hop in. Dayat, Adil, Kurip. Actually, it's been a long time since I did silat. Do you want to learn with my ways? -Really, Sir? -Really, Sir? When we learn silat, we actually learn how to control ourselves. How to control our emotion. There's a saying in Minang silat. "Enemies are not to be made, meeting them is not to be eluded." Silat in Minang is actually a part of enjoining good and forbidding wrong. Physically, silat is to make friends. Spiritually, silat is to find God. When we do silat, we foster good relationship with others. Salah, salawat, and silat. These three are the most important. It's useless to practice silat when you're oblivious of God. Adil. You can use it. Really, Sir? It's great. Can I try? For our practice this evening, we start with tafakkur. We recite Al Fatiha and Salawat in the Prophet. One time each of you. Get it? Start now. We start with "Ampang Suok". Adil. -Adil. -Yes, Mom. This is your late dad's shirt. I've resized it. I hope it suits you. Wow. This is very nice, Mom. It suits me. Now, we learn on how to concentrate. How to balance ourselves. I can answer, Ma'am. Rasuna Said. Ready? Let's run! Run! That was nice. What move was that? -Hello, assalamu'alaikum, Rustam. -Wa'alaikumussalam, Cibia. How are you doing in the city? Are you good? Alhamdulillah, I'm fine. Cibia. I work in Minang restaurant in Yogyakarta. -Signing up? -Yes, for three. -Dayat. -Dayat. -Kurip. -Kurip. -And Adil. -Adil. Three, right? It's done. I'm going to the toilet. Stay around. Well, well, well. Good. I'm a property agent now. I have a good news for you. Next week your nephew are going to compete. -Don't you want to see them? -I'm afraid I can't, Cibia. I have responsibilities here. Hardi, aren't those Rustam's kids? He's gone to the city. How come they still join the tournament? They are learning with Mr. Johar now. People said that he was a warrior in Kampung Bancah. Alright, then. I'm just calling to tell you that. Take care of yourself. Hey, Kurip. There he is. Assalamu'alaikum, Students. Good morning. Good morning, Ma'am. Alright, before we start our lesson, I'll announce four students who will represent our school... ...at the town level. First, Rani will compete for science subject. Ismil, congratulation. You'll compete for the arts. Fajri, you're on mathematics. And Kurip, you'll take on social science. What's wrong, Yat? Well done, Kurip. But don't you dare teasing Rani. What's the matter with you? You don't need to threaten me. Use your brain, not your muscle. Bring your thought forward, not just your tummy. -What do you want? -Bring it on! Show your move! Hey, come on now! You both are idiots. You, Dayat. Kurip is going for a competition. Not dancing with Rani. You have no right to be angry with him. And you, Kurip. Think it over. The eighth is the day of the tournament. Hey, Adil. How's Kurip? Is he going to join the social science contest or silat tournament? I don't know. He acts as if he wants to be an expert in history. If it's only us competing, it's just like you do it alone. You know how I am in the arena. Don't think that way, Dayat. Mr. Johar told us. Silat is to make friends, to find God, not to make enemies. It's not winning or losing that counts. I think we've done enough. If Kurip is there, we have hope. If not, just leave it to God. What about you and Hardi? Inshallah, I won't compete with grudge. -Hubby, I'm going now. - Yes. I'm going to Fat's house. -Okay, I'll catch you later. -Okay. -Take care. -Alright, Hubby. So, how is it, Kurip? I really want to take the social science contest. But I also want to compete. It's alright. Both are good, Kurip. It will not harm your faith if you don't compete. How long have you been training, Hardi? How long have you been training? Watch your stand. And you, where's your power? You too. Silat is not for fun, but for destroying people. Johar, prepare yourself. Masri. Sorry, Masri. I didn't do it on purpose. -Enough, Masri! -I don't think so. -Do you still hold grudges? -Of course. Thank you. Wish us luck, Sir. Inshallah, we'll compete tomorrow. Erna. Erna. What is it, Hubby? Don't tell the kids the truth. It's gonna distract them. Alright, Hubby. Kids. Kids. Be good tomorrow. Don't fight with emotion let alone grudge. Mr. Johar might have told you a lot. I just want to remind you. Also pray for Mr. Johar, okay? Wish him well soon. -Sure. -Sure. Let's start. "Dayat versus Bima, Sipasan Merah" Easy, Yat. Take it as an exercise. Start. "Hardi, Kalabang Hitam versus Amin, Kuciang Lapa" -Has our team been disqualified? -Well, here comes our historian. I'll change first. "Adil versus Boy, Sipasan Merah" "Kurip versus Rizki, Kuciang Lapa" "Dayat versus Toni, Kuciang Lapa" Enough! "Hardi, Kalabang Hitam versus Bor, Pusako Minang" "Adil versus Anton, Sipasan Merah" "Kurip versus Meko, Kalabang Hitam" "Semifinal Kurip versus Hardi, Adil versus Toni" Adil. Start. One, two, three, four, five... Can you still fight? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. "Final, Hardi versus Adil" Adil! Adil! Get ready. Start. Start. Hey, Adil. How come we have the same move? Beats me. Uncle Rustam! -Rustam. -Sister. In position. Start. He's still using the move I taught him. Hei, don't get it wrong, Uncle. That's the move taught by Mr. Johar. If he'd used your move, he would've been defeated. What? Rats abandon a sinking ship. His command is only when He intends a thing... ...that He says to it, "Be," and it is. Allah Most Mighty has told the truth. I'm so happy to see you this way. Hopefully your dad feels at ease in his grave... ...because his pious son always sends him a prayer. I hope so, Mom. Istighfar, Dil! Istighfar, Dil! When we learn silat, we actually learn how to control ourselves. How to control our emotion. Silat in Minang is part of enjoining good and forbidding wrong. Physically, silat is to make friends. Spiritually, silat is to find God. Hardi. What move was that? As your uncle, Adil. I was so embarrassed that people made fun of me at the stall. If you want your dad to be peaceful up there, you have to be good and always send him a prayer. Also pray for Mr. Johar. Wish him well soon. I want Dad to go to heaven, Mom. Inshallah, Son. "One month later" Alright, Ladies and Gentlemen. Let's listen to the prologue from our writer, Dr Johar Hakim. Please. Before I continue this prologue, I'd like to introduce someone who has inspired me so far. She's been supporting me all this time. My beloved wife, Erna. And three little friends of mine. They gave me even more reason to write this book. Adil. Kurip. Last but not least, Dayat. Ladies and gentlemen. This is a series of my notes that I write into a book. In my opinion, salah, salawat, and silat... ...are three things that always go together... ...and they shape the character and personality... ...of our children in Minangkabau.
