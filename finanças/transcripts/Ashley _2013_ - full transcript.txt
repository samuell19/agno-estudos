Ashley? Ashley? Did you have a good weekend? How are things going at home? Me and Stacy went shopping. How are things going with your mother? Bought jeans. That sounds fun. How's everything going in class? Learning anything new? Anything that you like? Reading "Catcher in the Rye." That was a good book. Do you like it? What do you like about it? Is there anything you wanted to talk about? Ashley? Nothing on your mind we can discuss? What happened to your hand? Is that a cigarette burn? Did you do that to yourself? Or- or did somebody do that to you? Ashley, do you smoke? Does your mother smoke? Okay, guys, we're going to be talking about Holden's character breakdown today, which everyone was supposed to do last night for their homeworks. So, hopefully, you all did. Um, let's all turn to page 75, please. 75- if anyone doesn't have a book, just look on to the person next to you... and... ♪ never fell ♪ never fell like this before ♪ ♪ never fell like this before ♪ ♪ I can feel it, humanoid ♪ looking out across the waves, I envision I am strong ♪ ♪ deep inside a wave, I still feel you in my base ♪ ♪ oh-oh ♪ don't... ♪ Don't...

That shrink of yours called from school. What did you do now, you little bitch, huh? Wants me to take you downtown to some... ...some group-therapy thing at a hospital. Do you hear me? Does he think you're crazy? Oh! Look at me! I can't do this. I can't take this shit! He says you got some burn on your arm. Did you do that? Took my lighter, didn't you? You know who gave me that? You know who gave me that?! Ashley? Ashley? I asked you if you were gonna to participate? You don't have anything to say. No. You know, if you're not gonna participate, there's really no point in you coming. Didn't choose to be here. How do you expect to work on your problems if you're not gonna talk about them? Hmm? Lay off her. I mean, that's like that's all you do. You just push us, push us. I mean, maybe some of us ain't got shit to say. I recall you having plenty to say, James. That's funny. Yeah, well, maybe she doesn't. It's not your turn to talk. It's Ashley's turn. Ashley, why don't you just tell us something about yourself. It's okay- safe here. Come on. Anything. She doesn't want to fucking talk! Okay, can we please cut the swearing? "We"? I'm the only one fucking swearing! Shit, balls. No, no, no. if you're not gonna cooperate - I'll have... This is bullshit! This is fucking bullshit! Sit back down now. Fuck you! Okay, that's it. Fuck you, you fucking bitch! Get off me! Don't fuck- Oh! You're out of here. Oh, fuck! Please stay here. Do not move. Don't worry. It happens all the time. Why don't you talk? Come on. What are you scared of? I won't bite you... unless you want me to. That's better. That's a nice lighter. What? I said, that's a nice lighter. Dad gave it to me. Your dad gave you a lighter? Can I sit? Yeah. I'm Vicky. Ashley. Can I get a light, Ashley? Nice. Is it real? I don't know. Scratch it. What? You know, like they do in the movies. They scratch gold to see if it's real or whatever, like, a knife. So cool. Your dad give you this, too? I bought it. Kick-ass. I like it.

Just do it! Fine, fine. Chill out. Ashley? Ashley?! Help me brush my hair? Don't look at me like that. Just help me. Gentle! Careful. That's nice. That's good. Your hair is messy. I used to brush your hair all the time when you were little. Here. See? You can go now. Hi. Name's Chico. You know, like the Marx brothers? You know, like Groucho and Harpo and Zeppo and Chico. You know Gummo? He's ur- the fifth Marx brother. He left before they hit big. I see you on the bus a lot. And I always thought you looked cool. I wanted to talk to you. >> ...against Philadelphia. And Colorado, a victory... >>...Will be a game 7. >>We'll see whether or not that holds up here in this game 7. Hello. Say hello to Bill, Ashley. Hi. Hi. >> Here comes Shanahan. Your mom didn't tell me you had her good looks. Say thank you, Ashley. Thank you. Say thank you, Ashley. Thank you. You're welcome. You have dinner with us? Listen. I hope we're gonna have dinner soon, 'cause I'm starving. It's almost ready. All right. >> What a blast down the chut! What do you think of him? Please. Can we just have a normal conversation for once in our lives? You saying anything would be great. I don't like him. Of course you don't. Just don't screw this up for me again with your charming personality. Just fucking forget it. Let's get dinner on the table. I hope everyone's ready for a delicious meal of veal and asparagus. I like your dream come true, Stacy. You're gonna make me blush, mister. Yeah, well, it's my job. Ashley... You know what veal is? It's baby cow. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Young, tender, juicy. I'm a little concerned about her appetite, not eating a damn thing. Ashley, eat. I'm not hungry. Eat your food. You know, I really love what you did with the place. It's really nice. You think? Yeah, yeah. Especially like this whole inverted-wine-glass thing. Very clever. Messed up. You've done a really nice job. Thank you. Yeah. ♪ Don't give it away now ♪ ♪ don't give it away ♪ ♪ can't you see... ♪ ♪ don't give it away now ♪ ♪ don't give it away to everyone ♪ ♪ don't give it away now ♪ ♪ can't you see... ♪ Hello? Homestarch? Yeah. Hi. Hi. You have a name? Yeah. Are you gonna tell me it? Ashley. Hello, Ashley. So, you're Candice. Yeah. What's the matter, shy? That's cute. I'm usually the shy one. You are? Yeah. Hmm. So, you sound like a nice girl. What are you doing talking to strangers online and giving them your number? Oh, the horror. I don't know. Huh, huh... I was just kidding, Ashley. So, you talk to a lot of girls? I do... But not like this. They don't have sweet voices. God, that sounded cheeseball. Crack a smile? You did, didn't you? Maybe. Hey, you may be shy, but you got a lot of guts, letting a complete stranger call you. I'm glad you let me. Gets lonely sometimes. Mm-hmm. You don't have a job? Um, not really, no. I- I inherited a ton of money when my parents passed away. So, I really don't have to worry about anything. Money-related, that is. Cool. Sorry about your parents. Thanks, Ashley. You know what? You made my day. You're different than the others. What usually happens in these chat thingies is, half the time they start talking dirty, get off, and that's it. The other half of the time, they're men, as if they can fool me. Are you still there? Yeah, I can hear you breathing. I'm not boring you, am I? No. So, what do you do, Ashley? I'm a student, high school. What do you do for fun? Do you have any hobbies? I like to paint. Nice! Really? I actually consider myself an artist. I paint, too. Kick-ass. You're cute. Would you mind if I called you again? Or I can give you my number, you can call me. Either way, I'd love to talk again. Okay. Really? You got a pen? Um... the number's on my phone. Oh, yeah, right. You have to go? No. Guess not. Cool. Okay. Ur, let's begin with your background, Ms. Collins. My background? Yes. I think that's irrelevant. You don't want to tell me about it? Okay, let's try something else. What do you do for a living? I'm a waitress. Okay. Pays the bills. And are you currently in any relationships? No, not really. Not really? I just started seeing someone, but it's early. What does this have to do with anything? And Ashley is 17, correct? Yes. And she's the only child? Yes. May I ask why you need to know all this? I just would like to understand all aspects of Ashley's home life so I can better assess the situation. "Assess the situation"? What does that mean? If this environment isn't safe - I provide for my child. There's more to providing than paying the bills. What if I told you to leave my house? That wouldn't be the best course of action. Get out. Ms. Collins. Now. If my report says that this is an unsafe environment for Ashley, the state will take her from you. Do you want that to happen? Okay. Let's talk about your background. ♪ I wake up and you're gone ♪ TV's still on ♪ and I sit, and I watch another rerun ♪ ♪ she is left all alone ♪ her lover's gone to sea ♪ and I can't help but feel she is just like me ♪ Why? ♪ and I gave all I could, Why?! But it wasn't... ♪ I like girls. What? I don't like boys. You li- ♪ I don't know why... Why didn't you tell - ♪ my heart still beats ♪ why I can't feel anything ♪ ♪ but I gave all I could ♪ but it wasn't good enough ♪ and you say you would be here before I woke up ♪ I'd like to try an exercise today. Ashley? Would you try this for me, please? Okay. I want you to picture yourself lying on a beach. The sun is perfectly warm, and you hear the waves crashing crashing into the sand. I want you to take a deep breath in and hold it. Now release it. Good. And I'd like you to do that two more times, slowly. Now picture yourself walking into a building. And a strong-armed security guard confronts you. But he sees you, and he knows you. He smiles. He places his arm around you, and you feel safe, secure. As you move on from there... Ashley? Is everything okay? Ashley, what's wrong? Ashley? Is it something in the meditation? Which part? The man! The man who put his arm around you? You thought of your father, passed away. So sorry. When he was alive, did he give you this feeling of security? Sometimes. Only sometimes? Why... why didn't he make you feel secure all the time? Did he hurt you? How? He... He... Wait. Ashley, look. Your father betrayed your trust in him, but you don't have to feel ashamed. There are good people out there who want to help you, okay? Okay, guys. So, what did we learn about this one? Yes. He was really annoying. Okay. I guess I can give you that one. Guys, Holden reflected on how he felt everybody was phony. But, what did we learn about him at the end of the book? Ashley? Ashley? What did we learn at the end of the book about Holden? Ash? I, uh, you know me, right? No. No? Not really. You know my name? Steve? Yeah, that's it. I, ur, was wondering, you want to kick it sometime? I don't know. You don't know? No. All right. Catch you later. Shit. Lose something? I- I can't find my debit card. Maybe you left it at the market. Huh, I have to go back. I'll go back for you. I'll get it. It's okay. I'll get it. You sure? Yeah, I'll handle it. Okay. See you later. Hey. What's new, pussycat? Your mom went back to the store. I think she left something there. You mind if I watch TV? Hmm? Oh, thanks. It's your mom's favorite show. She's crazy about that shit. By now you'd think she'd be a better cook. So... How's everything at school? I'm kind of worried about you, you know? You... Not too much to say. Huh. Drawing pictures, huh? I'd say you like... skin and bones. What happened to your hand? You know, that burn there. Let me see that. What is all that? My goodness. Are you doing that to yourself? What happened there? Finally. What are you doing? Nothing. Get away from her! I didn't do anything. Get out of my house! Get out of my house now. Stop being upset. I wasn't doing nothing. What were you doing on her? I wasn't on her. You were touching her! It's my daughter! Okay! Get out! Get the fuck out! What were you doing?! What were you thinking?! Fuck! Answer me! Answer me! Go to your fucking room! Hello? Is this Ashley? Hi. How are you? I'm glad you called. I'm lonely. You are? I've thought about you. Really? Not in a weird way. It was fun when we talked. Yeah. What are you doing? I think it's really cool that you're an artist, too. I'm always attracted to artists, for some reason. Hey, Ashley, can I ask you a question? Yes. Did you come online to meet someone to just... ...just chat? Chat. Or have you ever... I touch myself. You do? Do you want to now? Yes. Are you? Yes. Can I touch myself, too? Yes. I want to touch you. Me too. Yes. Can we do it together? Ashley? Did you... Yes. Yes. Hey, Ashley. What's up? Mind if I sit down? It's me, Carly. Carly, Sammy, and Summer. Remember? Really? I like your shirt. Oh, yeah. Nice. How about ditching next class with us? Meet you out back next period. So, you like girls, huh? Fucking freak. Come on. I'm sorry, you know? I don't mean to do things. You know, my brother likes guys. You know, how you like girls? He told my mom and dad on his birthday. My mom and dad kicked him out. He calls once in a while, and we're not allowed to answer. No one talks about him anymore. I really miss him, you know, gay or not. Your mom and dad know you like girls? No. Don't tell them on your birthday. Hey. Staying after school today, I see. I'm in detention. What's your excuse? Studying. Cool. I was wondering if we could, uh... Shit. Something wrong? God damn. Aah! I just need to validate that Ashley is living in a safe environment and doesn't require the state's intervention to protect her. She's the one with the problems, not me. How long has Ashley been this withdrawn? Since Michael passed away, her father... My husband. And how was Ashley's relationship with her father? It was very good. He loved her. He was a good man. And that's all? Ms. Collins? He, uh... Ms. Collins? I think he was... sexually... abuse... You think- you think that he was or... I know he was. Aah! Fucking bitch! You cut me! Bitch! Ashley? I can't believe it. Come- come in. Sorry. Come in. Huh, close the door, yeah. Thanks. Actually, let me take that for you. It's kind of heavy. Did you want me to take care your jacket? Oh, sorry. I'll just set it right here. Are you thirsty? Did you want something to drink? Sorry about the mess... too. It's my roommate's actually, my roommate. Am I what you expected? You're a lovely, young lady, Ashley. Yeah, sit down. Sorry. Here, let me take that. Are you sure you're not thirsty? Yeah. I mean, I have lemonade, diet root beer, water. No? Okay. Crack a smile? That's- that's Cassidy. She's an old friend of mine. She was sick. She passed away. You have her smile. You are so pretty. Do you know that? Do you like that? You're soft. I have an idea. Um- why don't I take you out? Okay? You don't have to worry about money or anything like that. Sound good? Okay. Okay. Cool. Oh, I wanted to show you something. It's- it's in my room. But it'll just take a second. Don't be shy. Sit. So, do you mind if I give you something of mine to wear for dinner? Okay. Awesome. Let's see what I got. Here we go. Here's a shirt. It'll look great on you. I should probably change, too, I guess. Beat you. That looks great. It looks good. How about mine? Okay? Good. Thanks. And a jacket. Got it? Perfection. You ready? Let's go. I love this place. I usually come here alone to think, but I've never actually brought anyone here, though. I like your smile. Do you like my smile? How about this one? Are you gonna laugh? Come on. It's good for the soul. See what I'm saying? ♪ And if you lead him to the valley ♪ What's the matter? You don't like sweets? No worries. ♪ When the weather vane is moving ♪ It's so good, right?
