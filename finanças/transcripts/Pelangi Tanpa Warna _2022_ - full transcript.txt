Kirana. Let's begin. They are waiting. - Yes, yes. - Come. Let's go. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Blow the candles! Go on. - Thank God. - Happy birthday, Divo, my beloved. Quick, where's the knife? Here, open this up. It's a surprise for you. - Thank you, Dad. - Okay. Excuse me. Where's the present from you, Mom? I forgot. It's okay. Give me a hug, then. Mom will give the present later. I hope you become a pious child, kind and smart. Mom and dad's favorite child. Dear, please help cut the cake. Let's cut the cake. Fer. -Take a look at this. - What? Come here. What's up? It's the wrinkles. - What? - Wrinkles below, here. That means you are getting older. You don't have to say the obvious. You are still beautiful. Are you going to leave me when my face gets wrinkled and saggy? Let me think about it first. You are so funny. I am yours, with all my heart, not eyes. No matter if you are old or wrinkled. If love is already set. You're such a sweet talker. I am going to finish my reading. - I need Botox, dear. - It's expensive. The cheaper one, then. Just sew it, then. Are you kidding me? Div, here's your lunch. Don't forget to eat it. - Yes, Boss. - Dear, don't be late. - Don't forget lunchtime. - What? I am going to cook grilled chicken. Not too much soy sauce, it is too sweet. I am already sweet. And faithful. Nonsense. - Are we going? - Yes, give me a kiss. - See you. - Be careful. Ma'am, do you want the chicken boiled? Boil it first, Sum. There's some blood left. It's dirty. - Have you salted it? - Not yet. Let me do it, please continue making the sauce. Yes, Ma'am. Ma'am. Are you okay? You do it. Yes, Ma'am. The chicken is ready. Where is Dad, Div? Dad is always late, Mom. - Peace be upon you. - Here he is. Peace be upon you too. I'm just a little late as if you don't know how Jakarta is. - Wow, nice. - I've prepared it. Where's the tea, dear? - Do you want me to make it for you? - No need, dear. Where is it? Here's the tea. Tea, coffee… How come the bottles are all labelled? You don't like it. I didn't write it. So who wrote it? Didn't you tell Sumi to write it, Ma'am? When? I didn't. It doesn't matter. It prevents mistakes. Do you want some rice? Salt. Sugar. Do you forget where the room is? Here comes the satire. How could you? You promised not to take your work home. - Tomorrow is Saturday. - I have to finish this paper tonight. I have to submit it tomorrow. You have a secretary, why doesn't Rena type it? Rena just give birth, I can't expect her to do this. I need you, Fer. I mean, not just being here. - I want you to be around. - All right then. I will finish it in fifteen more minutes. Okay? I promise. Okay. Starting from now. Okay. Package! Vegetables package! Sumi! Sumi! - Yes? - Please help with the package. Yes, ma'am. Package! - It's for Mrs. Kirana Putri. - Yes, right. Here it is. - Thank you. - Wait. - It is not paid yet. - Ma'am said it is paid. No, it is not. See it yourself. Come on. Ma'am said it is already paid. What is it? Ma'am said it is already paid. No, it's not. What's up? Why does it take so long, Sumi? The man said it is not paid yet. I have paid for it. You must be mistaken. It hasn't. It's a COD order. Just look at the application. It's not a cash-on-delivery order! I have paid for it. I have enough balance to pay for these vegetables. Ma'am, it is not yet paid. I have paid for it, sir! Bring it in, Sum. I don't care. - Ma'am, you haven't paid for it! - Nonsense! What should I do? Wait a minute, sir. Don't take too long! I have another order. Dad, is it true that Grandma will come here tomorrow? Yes, she wants to stay the night too. Too bad. She is very picky. She always tell me what to do. However picky, she is still your grandmother. Don't be like that. Now go study. Get her room ready by tomorrow. Do you want a cup of coffee? Did you make your own coffee? I could have it made for you. How hard is it to make a cup of coffee? What's hard is seeing my wife daydreaming and not knowing what she's daydreaming about. - You are all right, aren't you? - I'm all right. Then what are you doing? Are you thinking of something? What's up? Is there any problem? Or you hate that Mom's going to visit tomorrow? No, that's not it. - Really? - Yes, it is. So what then? If you have something to talk about, speak up. Don't keep it all inside. Yes, sir. I'm turning in. It's cold here. - Mom. - Kirana. Mom. - Are you good? - Thank God I am. How about you, Mom? I'm good. Look, I can go on this trip. - I'm happy to see you again, Mom. - Yes, I'm happy too. Are you alone, Mom? Where is Sister Yayuk? You know how she is. She always makes an excuse every time she makes a promise. Something always comes up. Busy with her kids. A date with a friend. And this time she told me she is reluctant to go out. She does not care at all for me. Hi, Sumi. You're from Wonogiri, right? - No, ma'am. I'm from Ngawi. - That's all right. Please work well here. Take good care of my son, daughter-in-law and my grandson. - Yes, ma'am. - Come on in, Mom. - What would you like a drink, Mom? - Something cold, please. You are a bit thinner, aren't you? Are you sick? No, Mom. But lately, I feel a bit tired. Take good care of your health. If not yourself, who else? - Yes, Mom. - Right, dear? Take vitamins, get enough sleep. Don't be like your father-in-law who died so suddenly. I don't want Ferdi to feel what I felt. Kirana, please promise me. Yes, Mom. I promise. - Hi, Mom. - Are you still busy this late, Ferdi? Yes, it is how it is. Don't just work all the time, give them some attention. You always get their full attention, while you're not doing the same thing. I have tried to spend some time with them. Are you sure it's enough? I think it's not enough. When I first saw Kirana, I knew right away that she is not okay. How come you didn't feel it? Yes. I know. And after you do? Why don't you correct it? Remember… money doesn't always bring happiness. Take me for example. I asked Dad to work hard so we can retire. But then, what happened? He passed away. And the money he left couldn't make me happy. You should be able to learn from what I went through. Take good care of them while you can. Enjoy it while you can. I don't want you to have any regrets. Like I do. Yes, I will try. Thanks. - Ma'am. Sir! - What's up, Sum? Mrs. Kirana is locked inside the bathroom. Keep calm, Mom. Don't panic. Divo, please help me. Divo, help! - Help, Dad. - Kirana! Open the door. Try open it from inside. Now try to open the door. Turn the key, Mom. It will open. Divo, please help me. Turn the handle to the right. Turn it until it clicks. Try it first. Kirana, I will get the key. Don't panic. - Move away. - Fer, don't play around! - Watch out, step back. - You are so out of line! What? I am not playing around. Kirana! - Fer! - You're not asleep yet? May I ask something? What is it? Am I being too mean to you and Divo these days? Am I? What do you mean by that? I feel… I am too busy working. I don't give enough time for you all. I even ask you to understand my job. Until I realized that I have ignored you all. I am sorry for that. You don't have to be sorry, Fer. You have done your best for me and Divo. I should be the one apologizing to you. For making it difficult for you. You never make it difficult for me. I am sorry. I thank you for bearing with me. Thank you for taking care of me. Divo, pick up your dish. You are a big boy, you should take your dirty dish to the kitchen sink. Mom, don't be too harsh on him. That is nothing. You should have taught him little things like that a long time ago. But I'm still here, Mom. But for how long? We can't tell what will happen to us. As a mother, we cannot be by their side forever, right? Where is Mother going to, Grandma? Mom is going nowhere. Yes, I'm going nowhere. Grandma is just giving an example. Come on. See? Are you still mad? Grandma is so random. She always talks nonsense. Now I'm afraid something will happen to Mom. Grandma doesn't mean it that way, Son. You know Grandma, right? What she said is not always true, right? What you say is what you pray for, right? Grandma said indirectly that Mom isn't going to be with us forever. What Grandma meant is for you to help Mom at home. That's what she meant. Mom is not leaving us, right, Dad? If God's willing. - Mom. - Where are you going, Kiran? I'm gonna go jogging. Just around here. That is nice. Do you want me to come along too? You don't have to. Just stay home, Mom. I will be out for only half an hour or so. - All right then. Be careful. - I'm leaving now, Mom. Mrs. Kirana. - Going by yourself? - Yes. - Isn't Mr. Ferdi coming along? - No, he is at the office. - All right then, I'll continue running. - Okay. - Excuse me. - Yes. I'm sorry, sir. I found Mrs. Kirana sitting under the tree. She seemed to be confused. So I brought her here. - Thank you very much, sir. - You're welcome. - Will you excuse me? - Okay, thank you. Kirana, where were you going? Please remember. You were jogging, then where were you going? Jogging? Mom said you were going jogging? Right? I… I was going to pick up Divo at school. Pick up Divo from school? He returns from school by bus. What are you talking about? I'm off. I'm tired. I don't get this. Mom. Kirana wants to give this to you. Why do you give it to me? I rarely wear these jewels now. It's a pity if they're unused. Do you want it to take it, Mom? My gift for you. Thank you, Kirana. Are you missing Dad? I miss him so much. I feel so alone without him now. You are not alone, Mom. You have Ferdi, Kirana, Divo, Sister Yayuk. The grandchildren. Do you miss your dad? I miss him. But I forget his face. My dad… So now you like my favorite song? A bit. When I heard about the story about Dad, Mom and you. How this song was often played at home. And Dad asked Mom to dance. That's why I like this song. - Really? - Yes. But don't dance too long, I will be late to the office. - All right. - I have to go now. - Be careful. - Yes. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. What are you cooking today, Sum? Fish curry, ma'am. Divo asked for it. Would you like something else? I will change the menu. No, it's fine. Oh, my. What's the matter, Sum? Mr. Ferdi's shirt got stained, ma'am. How can it got stained like that? How could you make mistake like that? - It's not me, ma'am. - Who then? But… Kirana, how could you mix these colored shirts with the white ones? If you can't do it, just don't do it. Sumi, apply some whitener now. - Soak it. - Yes, ma'am. Mom. Mom, let's get inside. Do you want to drink? Don't think what Grandma said. Grandma is like that. Grandma gets mad all the time. Where is Dad, Divo? He is at the office. He said goodbye to you, didn't he? Office… Why aren't you at school? The teachers are holding a meeting. Meeting… Why isn't it here? What is it? What are you looking for? I can't find my jewelry box. It's nowhere to be found! - That wooden jewelry box? - Yes. Didn't you give that to me yourself? - You said you didn't wear it anymore. - I'd never give it to you. Watch you mouth! I'd never take it from you. Wait a moment. But it's not here, Fer. Maybe you put it someplace else. - She clearly gave it to me. - Grandma! Grandma! Grandma, what's the matter? How could your mom say I stole this? She clearly gave this to me yesterday. She is out of line. This cannot go on! Eventually she will accuse everybody. - It's not here, Fer. - Try to find it in another place. Is this the box? See, this is my jewelry box! I didn't think you had the heart to steal this, Mom! - You gave this to me, Kirana. - That's impossible, Fer. How could I give our wedding jewelry to Mom? This is our wedding jewelry. There is no way I gave it away. There is no proof of that. I don't have any proof. But I can testify! You believe me, right, Ferdi? Don't ask Ferdi for some protection. You always think that I am wrong. If I knew that this was some kind of trap, I would never accept the box. Enough, Mom, don't make me and Ferdi fight each other! How long do you want to keep accusing Kirana? - You are the one accusing me! - Enough of this. - Kirana! - Mom! Mom! How is she doing? Is she all right now? Ma'am, Kirana has suffered a light stroke. She is fine now. Most importantly, don't make her emotional again. I tried to move her left arm and left leg. Always keep her company, never leave her alone. Make sure she never falls down. Fer, please come to the hospital. We will do further checks on her. I will refer her to a neurologist who is more competent to handle her. And one more thing, prevent her from getting another seizure. If that happens, it will be difficult for her to recover. - Excuse me. - Thank you. I will see you out. - I will go to the hospital soon. - Yes. MEDICA FARMA PHARMACY - Dad? - Yes, what's up? Dad, you once told me, that I am the second man of the house. That I have to take care of everything including Mom. You can tell everything to me. Thank God my son has grown up. Honestly, sometimes I feel guilty about Mom. I don't spend much time with her at home. It's not your fault, Dad. It's Grandma's fault. She is always mad at Mom. Do not think like that, just don't. But Mom is ill, Dad. She is ill. Ma'am, open the door. Mrs. Kirana, open the door. The door is locked. She is inside. Kirana, please open the door. Go find the spare key. Kirana! Open it! Kirana, open the door. Oh, my! The iron… Ferdi is coming, tell him to come. - Sir! - What's up? Mrs. Kirana is locked in the laundry room. And a cloth is burning there. Mom! Mom! Kirana! What are you doing? - Let get out of here, Mom. - Take her away. Quickly! Are you still angry at Mom? - You go to bed, it's late. - Dad. All of us know now that Mom forgets easily. You know that too, right? I am disappointed with you, Dad. Divo thought you are not angry because you knew Mom is all right. But Divo is wrong, Dad. Forgive me, Kirana. I'm sorry to wake you up. I apologize once again for making you scared. Tomorrow we are going to see a doctor. Take rest, now. Sleep. So how is my wife, Doc? It's still an early diagnosis, Mr. Ferdi. We will take a look at the CT-scan and MRI results. Sorry, Mr. Ferdi. Do you remember your full name, ma'am? Kirana… Putri. Kirana Putri. What are your husband's and son's full names? Ferdi… Bagaskoro. And? Divo… Satria Bagaskoro. - Excuse me, Doc. - Please. Ma'am, do you remember what year is this now? 2014. Upon seeing Kirana, I knew right away that she is not all right. Give them attention. Don't only be their center of attention but you don't. Fer. What's wrong? It's nothing. I promise you, from this day on… I will try to provide you with everything you need. So you don't have to be afraid. I won't be afraid. Because I will not forget you. And I promise to spend more time at home than at the office. But please remind me of that if I forget, okay? What's up, Kirana? Stop, don't pick it up. - Take care of it. - Yes, sir. We'll go to the bedroom. Take rest now. Sit down now. Are you all right? I am all right. - I want to go to the bathroom. - I'll take you there. - I can do it myself. - Wait a second. - Here, wear this. - A bracelet? This is not just a bracelet. This bracelet has my phone number on it. I don't want that incident when you forgot your way home to happen again. If you go out and forget your way home again, show people this phone number so they can contact me, okay? How come these bottles are labelled? I didn't write the labels. Turn the key, Mom. Divo, please help! Help me, Divo! I found Mrs. Kirana sitting under a tree, sir. When I asked her where she wants to go, she said home, sir. I brought her here right away. Where were you going, actually? You went jogging, and then where did you go to? I want to pick up Divo from school. Grandma said you were going jogging. I didn't think you have the heart to steal this, Mom! You gave this to me, Kirana. How could I give away our wedding jewelry to Mom? - This is for weekly grocery? - Yes, ma'am. Sumi wants to go to the supermarket today, ma'am. - I want to come too. - Why don't you stay home, dear? It's been a while since I went to the supermarket. You are not healthy yet. You still couldn't walk straight. Just stay home, okay? I'm with Sumi. It won't take long. I'm bored at home, Fer. All right then, take Divo too. I will get ready. Sum, I am going with you. What else, Sum? - Air freshener. - What do we use, Sum? - That one. - Yes. What else? Dad, should we go there too? I'm afraid Mom will get into trouble. It's okay. She is with Sumi. Just relax, will you? If everything is there, you can go to the cashier. Take this too. - It's complete, ma'am. - You can go now. I'm going to the cashier. Thank you. Where is Ma'am? I thought she was already in the car. Wasn't she with you? So she already got out? - Where is Mom, Miss? - Come on! - Kirana! - Mom! Look that way! Kirana! Ma'am, where are you going? Do you want to cross the street? Let me help you. Mom is not here, Dad. Wait. Hello? Yes, ma'am? Come on. Yes, she is my wife. Where are you, ma'am? Please wait, ma'am. I will come there. Thank you. Sumi! Mom? Are you all right? Kirana? Thank God. She looked confused when she was about to cross the street. - Thank you, ma'am. - Divo, bring her in. Thank you. Sumi, if that woman was not a good person, I don't know what would have happened to her. I'm sorry, sir. This is not the first time you've failed, Sumi. This is my last warning. If you do this again, you can go find another job. - Yes, sir. - Now go. - Excuse me. - Yes. Are you smoking again? I'm tired, Mom. I want to relax a bit. You will die earlier because you smoke. Quit smoking, Divo is still young. He will do what you do. So, how is the result of the check-up? Dr. Randu said the result will be available tomorrow or the day after. - Hopefully it will be faster. - Don't think about it. I am sure Kirana is fine. Yes, I hope so. Divo! Go pray… What are you doing? - Nothing. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - What? Nothing, Mom. - Let me see. - Nothing. - Where is it? - No. - I want to see it. - No. Don't say no to me! Are you smoking? Get out of the way! Are you smoking? Do you smoke? Don't you understand me when I say no? Why do you have to smoke? - No. - What are you talking about? - Why do you smoke? - No, Mom. - What's going on? - He is smoking! - Divo, are you smoking? - Answer him. Answer me. Are you smoking? I'm sorry, Dad. I haven't smoked it. I just want to try it. Try? Really? - What are you trying to accomplish? - Stop it, now. You too! How many times I have told you, quit smoking! - Now look, he is following you. - I am sorry, I apologize. Divo, go pray! Quick! - Come on now. - Quit smoking! Look at your son. Kirana! Kirana… Kirana! Kirana! Mom! Wake up, Mom! I'm sorry to ask, but has Mrs. Kirana been in a serious accident? She had a serious accident when she was in primary school. That is according to my in-laws. She was in the hospital for almost a month. Does it have something to do with that accident? This means the examination result is correct, Mr. Ferdi. This illness can be considered as very dangerous, Mr. Ferdi. She will slowly forget her past. It will get worse from day to day. Will she forget about me, Doc? Yes. When I was in the hospital suffering from typhoid, Mom bathed me just like this. Is that right, dear? That means now is your turn, Dad. You have to bathe Mom now. By doing it the same way. Yes. Now, it's done. Divo, get Mom's compact powder there. And her comb. Yes. Give it to me. All right. Make her more beautiful. Beautiful, right? Where's the comb? Mom is beautiful, right, Dad? She is always beautiful. Even when she is sleeping. - Ferdi. - Yes, Mom? I want to speak to you. Please have a seat. What's up, Mom? I am sad seeing you like this, Ferdi. She should be the one who takes care of you, not the other way around. She has attended to me before. So it's okay if I attend to her now. Kirana is ill, Mom, really ill. She is not making it up. - Dad? - Yes. You are not asleep yet? May I ask you something? About what? Yesterday you went to the hospital to get Mom's examination result, right? So what does it say, Dad? Is Mom really ill? Dad, don't lie to me, please. I want to take care of Mom too. That's why I want to know what Mom is suffering from. Ferdi, I want to ask, what is wrong with Kirana? This is the result, Mom. Alzheimer's? Yes, Kirana will forget about me, Mom. She will forget all of us. Forget about us all? CAUSES OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CURE FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ALZHEIMER'S IS A DEGENERATIVE DISEASE THAT HAS NO CURE Divo… Divo. - Yeah, Dad? - Aren't you going to school? No, Dad. Today I'm going to take care of Mom. But I am here to take care of Mom. Yes, but… I will feel restless at school, Dad. - May I, Dad? - Yes, okay. - Is Mom awake? - No, she's not. All right, I will make some porridge. Okay, help me take care of Mom. - Yes, Dad. - Off you go. Now, Mom. Open your mouth. Mom, you have not recognized Divo yet? In the next several months, Divo will take the Junior-high exam. After that, Divo will go to high school. You promised that you will accompany Divo. Remember? Come on, Mom. Say Divo, my name. You can, Mom. I haven't done my homework. You must be angry, right? I miss you getting angry, Mom. You must remember this song. If you forget, I will make you remember. Because this song is your parents' favorite song. They heard this song in a dance party. Remember it? Because of it, I like this song too. Now I am going to dance with you. Is Mom going to leave Divo, Grandma? I don't mind if Mom forgets Divo's name. I don't want Mom to die. Don't speak like that, dear. Your mom will surely recover. You have to be confident. Will Mom ever remember my name again, Grandma? - Yes? - Fer, how is Kirana doing? Still no progress. Have a seat, Mom. I always ask you to be a perfect wife to Ferdi. Without realizing it, I have become an imperfect mother-in-law. I should have been unselfish since my husband died. I should have learnt not to hurt anybody else. But I always blame you instead, Kiran. Please forgive me. Please don't hate me. Kiran, don't be afraid of me. I really love you, Kirana. I will check her. Mrs. Kirana, can you move your fingers? Please move your lips. Say "Ferdi." Please try, Kirana. Come on, Mrs. Kirana, you can do it. "Ferdi." How is it, Doc? Judging from her response, she can begin to communicate, sir. Will she recover? Or at least she can speak again. I am sure she can, provided that you train her continually. You have to be patient, sir. You have to excuse me. I will be back in two days, for her therapy. Good, thank you. Kirana. I know you can't answer my questions. But if you can answer my question, please blink once. If you forget, blink twice. Do you remember who is this? Remember? This one, do you remember? Thank God. Do you remember me, then? You remember me, Mom? Divo? Do you? Mom. You don't remember me, Mom? Mom… Don't forget me, please. - Calm down. - Don't forget me, Mom. Calm down, Son. Mom… Kirana. Do you remember what day, month and year it is today? Today is our special day. On this day, a long time ago, I proposed to you. Do you still remember this ring? This is our engagement ring. I don't want to sell this ring. Even though you already have the wedding ring, that you are still wearing now. Happy anniversary, Darling. I want to remember it forever, for you. Kirana Putri… Please always be a rainbow in my heart. Light up our home forever. Don't let it go out. Happy anniversary. I love you. Dad, Mom looks very pretty here. She will look pretty forever. She doesn't change at all, that's the fact. Mom once said, in every home there must be a rainbow. The rainbow in this home is your mom. Who are you people? I am Ferdi Bagaskoro, your husband, Kirana Putri. And this is Divo Radya Bagaskoro. Our son. Yes, I remember. Ferdi. Divo. Thank God. I remember. Thank you, Dad. Okay. - Excuse me. - Mom will give the present later. I hope you become a pious child, kind and smart. Mom and Dad's favorite child. Don't forget, okay. I am just a little late, as if you don't know Jakarta. Family will always be the place to come home to, get some warmth and strength before we move on. THANK YOU TO ALMIGHTY GOD Care for it with your body, love it with your soul. And your family will forever be a home for your heart. The time has come that we must be apart The memory is still in my mind But you have gone And you leave me alone Why do you love me… So sweet… And tenderly? I'll do everything To make you happy But now everything Is only a dream A dream That never comes I only wait Till true love will come Why do you love me… So sweet and tenderly?
