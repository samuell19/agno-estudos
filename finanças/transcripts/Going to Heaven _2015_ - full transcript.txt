I don't know… if this is recording or not. If you'll hear my words… or receive a blank tape… with no sound on it. But the tape is rolling. I have no choice. I will share everything inside me, even if my voice will remain trapped between these walls. So what shall I tell you? Blame you, admonish you or plead to you? My son. Sultan's father. What is your name? My name is Sultan. How old are you? Eleven years old. Who is this phone for? My grandma. But this phone has been used. Why didn't you buy a new one? I gave it to my friend, Saud. He didn't use it a lot. - Have the kids woken up? - Yes. Okay, be smart, go. My eyes are feeling better now. They dried up. You don't really know… whether your eyes are dry or… you've become an old man… who puts drops in his eyes. Oh, God. Listen. Before you leave the house, I want you to throw away the fish that you brought. I don't want your room, or the house, smelling of fish! Yes. The smell of fish has been strong the past few days. Hey. Don't put that on, you're still young. Why didn't you wear it at home? Mom didn't let me wear it, she said I was still young. What do you think? Do I look nice or not? Very nice. Sultan, your sister's bus isn't coming this way. It's heading towards the shops. I don't know why my mom doesn't like you, Sultan. Because I'm not her flesh and blood. Since my mom died, no one defends me anymore. So you're mom isn't coming back to defend you? How can she come back? Why don't you pray to God every day for your mom to come back? Fatoum, people who go to God don't come back. If you go to God, will you see your mom? Of course, I'll see her. Then die. Sultan. Yes, sis. - You like fish, right? - Yes. Not once have I seen you eat fish. I like them, but I don't like to see them when they're dead. Sultan. Did you see the old woman that was sitting over there? No. She looked like Grandma. - Where did you see Grandma? - In Dad's bag. Are you making this up? I swear, I saw Grandma in Dad's bag. Which bag? And why didn't you tell me? I forgot. Yesterday, Dad's bag was open, I took the picture, Dad came in and pulled it away from me. I asked him who it was. He said, "Grandma." You're joking, right? I swear. Believe me, she looked like the woman who was sitting there. Hey, Fatoum, when you come back from school, show me this bag. I want to see Grandma. Do you have any fish food? Saud, why didn't you go to school today? I couldn't, I had to fix the bike. Did you know we're going on a trip to Dubai with school? Yes, I know, they told me. Saud, why are you going so fast? Afraid? Don't be. We're young, we won't die. We still have so much to live for. Besides, God will take older people first. Saud, I want to tell you something important. Tell me, what's on your mind? My sister, Fatoum, said that she saw my grandma's photo. What? Are you serious? Yes, I swear. Where did she see it? She said she saw it in my dad's bag. And why didn't he show it to you? He doesn't actually want me to see her or contact her. So, what are you going to do now? Saud, I want to go see her. - I found it! - Who? Grandma? No, stupid. Burj Khalifa. Didn't you see it on TV? Now, you'll see it for real. Damn you. - No, how can we eat them? They're burned. - It's normal. How we gonna eat them, Hamoud? Put out the fire. - No, don't worry, it won't burn me. - How are we gonna eat them? - They're burned. - See you, Saud. Bye. The fish in the middle is mine. - How are we gonna eat them? - I'll just take mine and eat it. - They're all burned. - Me too, I'll take mine and eat it. - Is it normal? - Yes, it is normal. Look at the fire. - They're all burned. - Me too. I will take mine and eat it. Saud. Do you know what my stepmother did? She threw away my fish. And some kids burned them. Fatoum, do you know where the key is? Saud, where are you? Sultan, do you have the key? No. Then how are we meant to open it? Please try, maybe it will open. We have no choice but to break it. What? What if my dad finds out? Then put it back. I told you to try. There's no choice but to break it! Yesterday, I dreamt of Sultan. I saw him wearing blue, like a wave coming from afar. Sultan, where are you going? I hear Grandma. She's calling out me and I can smell her perfume. I called him but he didn't hear me. If you take one more step, you'll fall and die. Didn't you say that young people can't die? And that God will take older people before us? And when I saw him coming toward me, he was wearing the clothes I had bought when he was born. I went to hug and embrace him, but I saw you, his father, calling him and shouting, so he turned away from me and left. What is this? What do you want? I want you to open it. What's in it? My books for school tomorrow. I have an exam and I want to study. Hey. I want you to open it, not buy it. I don't know if this is recording or not. If you'll hear my words or receive a blank tape. I can't believe that I haven't seen Sultan. Since his mother died… I've imagined his face a million different ways. But his blue clothes stay the same. Every day I place them on the bed and say, "Oh God." "Oh God, please let me see him." Do you know what Grandma said on the tape? She said she's dying to see me. Yes, I know. She is yearning a lot for you. So, how will we go see her? Fatoum, I found Grandma. Keep it down so no one hears you. I found her address. And I got to hear her voice. Her voice sounds very beautiful. Where is she? Let me see her. Sorry, Fatoum, but she lives in Fujairah. But I promise you, tomorrow, she'll be home. - And she'll live with us. - Who are you going with? I'm going with my friend, Saud. What if Dad finds out? How will he find out? He signed this paper to allow me to go on the Dubai trip with school. Is it okay if I come with you? No, stupid. You're a girl, you're not allowed to wander about outside. But promise me you won't tell Dad. Wow! 117 kilometers! Saud, what does that mean? A hundred and seventeen kilometers? If Dubai is 117 kilometers, then how far will Fujairah be? Why? Won't your bike be able to go that far? Are you mad? Then why do I always see Saloom's older brother taking his bike to Dubai? Hey, stupid. Saloom's older brother brought his bike from Argentina. Do you know where that is? It's the country of Maradona and Messi. Saud, watch out! I have a great longing In my heart and I'm infatuated Saud, aren't you in pain? Don't remind me. Saud. Look at your leg, it's dripping blood. Saud, please don't ignore me. Saud, let us sit down, please. I'm worried that the injury in your leg will get worse, then we won't be able to go to Fujairah. Saud, I'm talking to you. - Stop ignoring me. - Be quiet! I heard you, I'm not deaf! And it's my leg, not yours. Whether it gets worse or not, that's none of your business. Okay. What did I do to you? I'm sorry. It's good that you warned me. Or we would have struck that car. You upset? I'm sorry that I shouted at you. I have a great longing in my heart And I'm infatuated That longing is endless Your love Is what I'm dying for, and I love you - Hi. - Hi. Two tickets to Fujairah. No tickets to Fujairah here, only Sharjah. At Sharjah, you can get to Fujairah. They don't have buses to Fujairah. Okay, two tickets to Sharjah. Fifty dirhams. - When does the bus leave? - In five minutes, around the corner. Five minutes. Saud, quick, let's move. Grandma! Grandma, we're coming to you! We're coming to take you home with us! If it wasn't for the distance, my son, I wouldn't have let you deprive me of him. Or the vile woman you call your wife stop me from seeing him. I can't believe you had the heart to do this to me. How did she let you abandon me all these years? The last time I saw you he was four months old. And on your wedding day with that wicked woman I only knew him as a baby. Saud. Saud, wake up. We're close to the Burj Khalifa. Saud. Saud, wake up. Saud, wake up, please. We're close to the Burj Khalifa, wake up! One minute. Saud, you promised you'd take a photo of me with the Burj Khalifa. Buddy! Buddy, stop! Buddy, I said stop! Saud, wake up, the driver won't stop. Some other time. Didn't you promise to take a photograph of me with the Burj Khalifa? What? When will the second bus go? The second one, after 12:00. Sultan! Take the fish, Sultan! Take it, Sultan! This fish is for you! Don't lose it, Sultan! Sultan! Sultan! Didn't you hear me? I was talking to you. Come on, let's go. Salaam alaikum, sir. Wa alaikum salaam. Sir, we want to go to Fujairah. Please take us with you. - How do you know I'm going to Fujairah? - Your plate is from Fujairah, sir. That means you're definitely from Fujairah, right? Right, boy. - Are you from Fujairah? - Yes, sir. Then what brought you to Sharjah? We came to see a match. A match… Okay, get in. You lied to him as well? But won't God send us to hell for lying? Do you want to see your grandma or not? - Yes. - Then get in. I want to ask you something. Who was playing at the match you attended? Al Ain and Al Ahli. Al Ain and Al Ahli? And who won? Al Ain, of course. - You seem to be an Al Ain fan. - Yes, sir. Your friend, is he also an Al Ain fan? An Al Ahli fanatic. What a friend. So you came from Fujairah to watch Al Ain and Al Ahli play in Sharjah? Yes. Good. So which part of Fujairah are you from? Huh? From Fujairah. Okay, Fujairah, but which neighborhood? Where's your father from? Sir, just drive there please. Yes, God willing. Sir, why did you stop? - Get out. - Sir, why? I said get out! Both of you. Try and fool me. Do I look like an idiot to you? Get out. - I won't go out. - I said get out. Sir, let me tell you what's going on. - Sir! - Get out. I said get out! Is this a game to you? Try and fool me. Get out! Open your hands! Let go! Sir, we came from Abu Dhabi to see Sultan's grandma who he's never met before. Get in the car. You too. Get in. I was wondering. When you came here from Abu Dhabi, weren't either of you afraid? And your families over there, aren't they worried about you? No, sir, don't worry. We fooled them. We told them we were going on a school trip. We changed our direction, and now, we're here with you. You could have come with your friend's dad. At least he'll see his mother. My dad… After my mom's death, he married again. And the woman he married is evil. She won't leave me alone. Even my little sister, Fatoum, who is her own flesh and blood, she won't even leave her alone. I don't know what's going on between them. My dad is very scared of her. Sir, stop the car for a moment. Why? Please stop the car for a moment. I'll be back in a few minutes. Okay. Sultan, what are you doing? I'm burying the fish. What? Are you stupid or what? We're already late, come on. Who buries a fish in the sand? A fish's burial should be in water, even if it's dead. Sir, Sultan likes fish a lot. He doesn't like to see them dead. Everyone likes fish. They're a gift from God. So what are your names? I'm Saud, and this is my friend, Sultan. Good. What's your name, sir? Me? My name is Mohammed. My friends call me Mohammed The Mackerel. Why are you laughing? Sultan, your luck is picking up. Uncle Mohammed has fish. Really, sir, you have some fish? Yes, I have some fish. Khan! Bring two bundles of wood and put them in the car. Okay, no problem, I'll bring them now. Come on, boys, get out. Close the windows for a second. Hello? Hi, Salma, what is it? My mom? What's wrong with her? It's okay. Listen to me, stay calm. Do you see the TV? On the right, you'll find a yellow box. Take two pills and give them to her. Get her ready, I'm on my way. Okay? I'll come and take her to the hospital. Okay, goodbye. Is something wrong, sir? Are we there yet, sir? Yes, we're here, but I'm going to drop you off now. My mother's sick, so I have to take her to the hospital. No problem, sir, we have the address. We'll take a taxi from here. Okay. Thank you, sir. You've been very kind to us. No problem. - Take care of yourselves, okay? - Yes, sir. What are you looking for? One minute, Saud. Sultan, I'm talking to you. What are you looking for? I can't find Grandma's photo. And where's the address? The address is on the photo. Did you bring the photo with you or not? Come on, remember! Last time I saw it was after I buried the fish. Then how did it get lost? I don't know. Saud. Maybe I dropped it at the market, when Uncle Mohammed stopped. Where did it go? What are you looking at? Where did it go? I remember Uncle Mohammed stopped here. I took out my bag and went to the shop. I expected the photo to be here. Or maybe I left it in Uncle Mohammed's car. Uncle Mohammed's what? Enough! There's no time to cry now. Stop! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma, where did you go? Where did you disappear to? Grandma, I want you. If you don't want me, I want you. If you don't love me, I love you. Grandma, do you hear me? Please show yourself, Grandma, just for a minute! Listen to me, Grandma! I said listen to me! Here. I don't want it. Saud, we haven't eaten anything since this morning. At least eat this. Take it. I told you, I don't want it. We have to go back to Abu Dhabi. What? Yes. The photo is gone and the address on the photo is also gone. I promise when we go back to Abu Dhabi, I'll ask my mom to bring us back here. We'll search all of Fujairah until we find your grandma. And that's a promise. You want to go back to Abu Dhabi, go back alone. I'm not leaving till I see my grandma. Sultan, we have to… I told you I'm not leaving till I see my grandma. You're my best friend and you won't stay by my side? You want to go to sleep in your mom's bosom? Then go! Go sleep in your mom's bosom, go! Saud, what are you doing? I'm playing. What are you playing? The insect game. How far did you get to? One hundred. Saud. Do you think we can find my grandma? Sleep, maybe you'll dream of her. Saud, if I dream of her, do you think we'll really find her? Stop asking so many questions. You have to sleep and dream. But I'm not tired yet. Saud, you're the best friend I've ever had. And I like you more than my stepmom. You too. Amoori plays it to Messi, Messi plays it to Amoori. Amoori goes forward, forward. Returns the ball to Messi. Messi goes past one, two, three players. Returns the ball to Amoori. Amoori goes forward, goes forward. He kicks it and goal! Oh, God! - What is it? - Open up! - No, we're closed. Come back tomorrow. - Open the door! - We're closed. Come back tomorrow. - I need water! Water! Here. Thank you. Hey, kid, stop! I said stop! - What do you want? - Give me the water. - You're coming to me because of water? - Yes. Come here. - Raise your hand. - Why? Raise your hand, don't argue! Remove your hand. Take his phone! Take it. Why are you giving it to me? Take it. No, that's for your grandma. Didn't you say that we're lost and won't be able to find her? Here. Saud! Uncle Mohammed! Uncle Mohammed! Of course, something like this would happen to you. You're still young, you don't know the world. Anyways, your grandma won't get lost. And, hopefully, you'll see her. Hello. Hi, Salma. Is there something wrong with Mom? Can't someone else collect her from the hospital? I'm on the road now. I'm on my way to Abu Dhabi. Okay, fine. I'll come back now. Okay, bye. Hello, Mom. I hope you're doing better. The doctor's reassured me that everything will be okay. And, hopefully, you can come with us. What's your name? She said, "What's your name?" My name is Sultan. I've come from Abu Dhabi. Saud, what's that in her hand? That's an IV. It's normal. So, she's not dying? Wow! This place is really nice. Our country is really nice. - Look, it's similar to your bike. - Where? Screw you. My bike is nicer, but okay. Sultan, what are you doing in the car? Come on, boys, come out. I'll finish my coffee, but if you need to use the bathroom, it's in the back. Come on, quickly, we still have a long road to Abu Dhabi. - Come in and wash up. - Yes, Uncle. Saud. Are you going back to Abu Dhabi? Yes, with you. This place is really nice. You like the place or Uncle Mohammed's mom? Hey, have you seen Sultan? No. Where did he go then? Uncle Mohammed is waiting for us. We're going to Abu Dhabi now. Sultan! Uncle Mohammed is waiting for us, come down! Tell him I'm not going. I'm staying here till I find my grandma. You idiot, you still have hope that you'll find your grandma here? Uncle Mohammed has been kind to us. If we hadn't found him, we would still be lost. Will you come down or shall I call your dad? Trust me, I will let him know that you lied to him and came here to look for your grandma. You're a traitor. Now that I'm close to my grandma, you want to take me away from her? I'm not coming down. Thank you, dear. Listen to me, boys. I cannot take responsibility for you. If your families knew you were with me, what would they say? I'm not looking for trouble. My mother's illness is enough. Grandmas are all the same. They all have good hearts. Sultan, I know you're worried about your grandma and want to go find her. But believe me, tomorrow, when you find her, you'll grow tired of her. But you always see your mom. Do you grow tired of her? Hey! Who are you? What are you doing? You must be Uncle Mohammed's daughter, right? Where's your husband? I don't see him. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. - Come. - Come. - Come. - Come. How long was that? You reached ten. - Wow, ten? - Yes. Very nice. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22… Hey, Saud. Who is the pregnant woman at Uncle Mohammed's house? I asked her, but she didn't reply. I think she's stubborn. But beautiful, right? Damn you. Why? Are you jealous? No. Not of you. You are really looking sharp. Saud, don't make fun of me. Why? Are you going to flirt with her? I have to be looking sharp because I'm to face Uncle Mohammed's mother. Hey, stupid, call her Grandma, not Uncle Mohammed's mother. Oh, yes. I forgot, sorry. No, thank God. You know, Mom. When you used to put food in front of us, it wouldn't taste as good if you weren't with us. That boy, Sultan, has taken us back to the old days. God bless him. Here we go. You know, he only sees you in this place. He looks like he might kidnap you from us. I hope you feel better. Grandma. Uncle Mohammed likes fish, right? How come he doesn't take care of them? Do you like fish? Yes, Grandma, I had some very nice fish. But my stepmom threw them away. And the neighborhood kids came and cooked them. Hey, Grandma, wait for me a minute. I'll come right back, okay? Please, Grandma, wait for me. Hey, Grandma, do you want to hear the voice of the grandma that we lost? But, Grandma, she sent the tape to my dad. Listen. Since you married that jinni you call a wife, she has cast a spell on you. Yes, a spell on you. She turned you upside down. You went and left me in Fujairah and became just like her. Dressed in her attitude. You stopped me from seeing you and seeing Sultan. After yesterday's dream… I cannot wait anymore, I'm tired. I'll take a taxi and come to you in Abu Dhabi. Even if I have to walk, I'll do anything just to see Sultan. Where will I go? I don't know the way. You didn't give me an address or anything. But I am coming and taking Sultan with me. He who doesn't have affection for his mother, won't feel it for his son. Let that jinni serve you. I have no one but God and Sultan. I'm asking you, Grandma. What? I want a photo of you. No, my dear. It's not nice. Please, Grandma, I won't show it to anybody. I want a photo so that when I go to Abu Dhabi, I can see you again. That cannot be, my dear. I lost Grandma's photo and I only have her voice. Just let me take a photo so I can have a voice and an image. Ready, Grandma? I'll count to three. And I want you to speak to me and tell me a story, okay? Ready, Grandma? One, two, three. - No, I can't. - Please, Grandma, please. I won't show it to anybody, I swear. Go ahead, talk, what is it? Nothing, I just want to know what's in your stomach. Girl or boy? How is it any of your business? It's none of my business. I was just asking. I hope it's a girl. Men have no goodness in them. You mean Sultan has no goodness in him? He came all the way from Abu Dhabi to see his grandma. Sultan is still a boy. And I'm afraid he might become like his dad when he grows up. You seem to have issues with men. Yes, I have issues, especially with you. What are you doing? I'm cleaning the phone. Is the bike here? What bike? The one driven by the farmer every day. Yes, why? I want to go to the market. What is your name? My name is Sultan. How old are you? Eleven years old. Who is this phone for? My grandma. But this phone is old. Why didn't you buy a new one? I gave it to my friend Saud. He didn't use it a lot. What nice clothes you are wearing. - Looking sharp? - Yes. Grandma, I bought you this phone as a gift. Why go to such trouble? My gift is for when you see your grandma, hopefully. - Why? Aren't you my grandma? - Yes. Then I have no one but you. I couldn't find my grandma, so I'm giving you this gift. - Grandma, do you know about Snapchat? - No. Grandma, it's an app. I can stay in contact with you from Abu Dhabi. I send you a photo, you send one back to me. We can hear each other's voices. Don't worry, Grandma, no one will see them. If you don't know how to use it, let Salma teach you. Thank you, Grandma. Sultan! Uncle Mohammed is waiting for us! Grandma, Uncle Mohammed is waiting for us. Thank you. Travel safe. Son, don't embarrass me like this, it's not nice. But for your sake and the sake of your grandma, I'll tell you a fairytale. Once upon a time, very long, long ago, there was a man heading to his homeland. And on his ride, he was carrying rice, dates, sugar and water. And the weather was deadly hot. And the sun was flaming hot. When he got closer to his homeland, he grew tired. He dismounted next to a ghaf tree and tied up his ride. Then he laid his head down and slept. He was still sleeping when he heard a sound. He woke from his sleep and looked left and right. But he couldn't see anybody. He covered his eyes again and went to sleep again. After a while, he started to hear the sound again. He opened his eyes and saw this woman crying. He spoke to her, but she didn't reply. Turns out that the woman is mute and doesn't speak. He got up and gave her some water. She drank the water. Then he got up and gave her dates. She ate the dates. And her tongue turned out to be really long. He kept on looking and looking and looking and then… Sultan? Sultan? Sultan? The poor thing's asleep.
