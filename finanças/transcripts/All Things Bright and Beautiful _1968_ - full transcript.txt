RADIO ANNOUNCER: And, finally, a request for Beryl Jones of 13 Barrack Lane in Middlesbrough. Your fiance, Trevor, has asked us to wish you a happy 30th birthday. So, Beryl, happy birthday. [ UGLY DUCKLING PLAYING ON RADIO] [RAZOR BUZZING] [INDISTINCT MUMBLING] That's all of it. I need time off or something. [CHUCKLING] Aye. Can't afford it. [RAZOR BUZZING] Dad? Look at this, Dad! It's deadly, isn't it, Dad? TOMMY: [WHISTLING] Look at those spokes. It's a BSA. Do you know what BSA stands for? It stands for Birmingham Small Arms. For guns. Bet you didn't know that. Grand. Lovely. Come on. Usual for the lad, Thomas? Aye. RADIO ANNOUNCER: It's 9:55. And now the Reverend William Bennett continues his meditation on the life of St Paul. [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] REVEREND BENNETT: He is the messenger, the precursor, even though he comes after. He has become, in truth, a retrospective John the Baptist, translating the Lord's word, making straight his path, as it were. Turning the arcane of utterances of John and Mark into the forms and structures... [CLEARING THROAT] On behalf of myself and the other altar boys, I'd like to say how much we appreciate this day out. Well, indeed. Thank you, Barry, that was very nicely put. Very nicely put, indeed. I hope we all, all of us, enjoy a day of wholesome fun. Look at this place. This is not a rich place. And yet, these people, out of their slender means, have raised this lovely tribute to Our Lady. Is it not odd that our parish cannot, or will not, Barry, build the grotto Our Lady so richly deserves? Is it not? [ENGINE STALLING] [ENGINE HISSING] Oh! [BIRD CHIRPING] [BOYS LAUGHING] [BOYS LAUGHING] This is me. This is Bill O'Hanlon, Canon of Bessbrook now, Barry. [SIGHING] Canon. And this is, uh, oh, what's his name? [BOYS SQUEALING] Dick Feegan. Monsignor Feegan, now, Barry. Monsignor. Hmm. Still, vanity of vanities, eh, Barry? [FAIRGROUND MUSIC PLAYING] Psst, do you know how Danny Joe got so humpy? An RPM hit him, boom. Look at this, your dad's in trouble. -He is not. -He is. Look, it says here, "Woe to publicans." -[LAUGHS] -Shh! And now, before we go to celebrate the sacrifice of the mass, let us pray to Our Blessed Lady. Oh clement, oh loving, oh most sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us sinners that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Now, boys. [BABY CRYING] My dear people, we are now six months into the Marian year, that joyful year which our Holy Father has consecrated as special to Our Blessed Lady, Mary, the Mother of God. And yet, it would seem we are no nearer, my dear people, no nearer our goal in this month of June than we were in April, when we resolved to lay the foundations of a grotto to Our Blessed Lady. Or May, when we said we would finish it. And the reason for this delay, this procrastination... The collection for Our Lady's grotto in this church last week came to four pounds, three shillings, and eight pence. Now, I know we are not greatly endowed with material goods here in the lower parish, especially since the closure of the mill. But neither were the Apostles. They were, in the main, poor fishermen. And if these simple fishermen, in following Christ, thought it right to shower honour, respect and affection on the Blessed Virgin, then so should we. [COUGHING] Dig deep, my dear people, in the name of Our Holy Mother. Dig deep into your generous souls and your pockets. That is what I ask. That is what the Blessed Virgin asks, dig deep! And find the means to build Mary's grotto in Mary's month of August. -[COUGHING CONTINUES] -God bless you all. Now let us praise the Mother of God and remind ourselves of her attributes in the words of the litany. Tower of ivory. -CONGREGATION: Pray for us. -Dig deep. House of gold. -Pray for us. -Find the money. -Ark of the covenant. -Pray for us. -Dig deep. -Gate of heaven. -Find the money. -Pray for us. -Morning star. -Pray for us. -Dig deep. -Psst. -Health of the sick. -Pray for us. -Pray for us. -Pray for us. -Refuge of sinners. -Pray for us. -Comforter of the afflicted. -Pray for us. -Help of Christians. -Pray for us. -You got out early. -Aye, for a change. Father McAteer was on his usual tack. The grotto? He harangues us, that man, with that silly RADA accent of his. Where did he get it? He's from Cady. That's how they talk in Cady. I think his voice is nice. MAEVE: So do I, poor man. You'd think they'd give him the money to build his grotto. There's no money this end of the parish. There's enough to buy a drink. I had the B men in last night... [SARAH SINGING] ♪ B men, the B men ♪ ...looking for raiders. Nothing in Dungannon. They're a bloody nuisance, the IRA. Ellie says they're heroes.

They've nearly finished building their grotto. Have you seen it? It's a sight. It would be. Big Jack's building it. It's a gazebo, all right. And why we need two in the parish... This is what I can't fathom. Especially if Our Lady's going to appear in person. -What? -That's what he said, Mammy. He got all cross and theatrical. I wonder about him, I do. "Perhaps the people of the lower parish..." Eileen! And then Mickey Ferns comes in. [MIMICKING SEAL] That's Mickey Ferns, all right. "Perhaps the people of the lower parish "are waiting for Our Blessed Lady to appear in person." -Eileen. -[LAUGHING] That's what he said. What's wrong here? What's this?

He said, "It needs room for the Good Thief", I swear. And then he said, "Grotto of ivory." I thought that, all right. They're mad in the lower parish. [ALL CHUCKLING] Psst, give us a bite. That's more than half! You never give me anything. You can have half of this. You shouldn't do that. Why not? You're an altar boy, it's a sin. It's not a sin, you big eejit. Shagging's a sin, come on. Come on! I saw the Good Thief. In a vision, like the children of Fatima. Barabbas. You know him, don't you? From Cavalry, from Calvary. I'm sorry about Calvary. Well, so I thought if he appeared then you could, too. Like Fatima. I know their names. Lucia, Jacinta, Francisco. Where was I? Oh, yeah. If you could appear, it would make Father McAteer so happy. The people would pay for a grotto then. If you appeared. Barabbas appeared in my secret place, but you wouldn't have to. See, it's a bit cramped. But you could appear here if you wanted to. Or anywhere. 'Cause you are everywhere, or is that Jesus? Anyway, if you're not sure about appearing, ask Barabbas. He'll tell you this is a nice place. He will, ask him. [BELL TOLLING] Ellie? Ellie? Ellie, Ellie! What's wrong, Ellie? The B men were here. ♪ The B men, the B men ♪ [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] They broke the dog. And the bed. BARRY: What were they looking for? Ellie? What were they looking for? Sure, how would I know? They were just laughing at everything. Laughing at the house and the pictures, and this thing and that thing. Laughing at us. Mum? Mum, do I have to go? You'll love it. If I go there, will I have to grow up? Come here. You'll never have to grow up. You'll be my baby, always. Always. I've been thinking about Father McAteer and the grotto. I could design one for you, bigger than the one in the upper parish. More pointy. Grotto of ivory. [WHISPERING] Grotto of ivory. I'd put the good thief in too 'cause he appeared to me. So you'd be Our Lady of the Cross. Would you go in it if I designed it? You need different clothes too if you're going to be Our Lady of the Cross. Sadder colours. [WHISPERING] Sadder colours, yeah. Oh, God, let it be so. Let it be so. Ellie? Ellie, have you seen my gold scarf? [THUD] Ellie? Barabbas? I've brought them, look. If they were the right colour, my mother would sell them. They're sadder colours, I think. This colour is sad. Here's the grotto. It's far bigger than the upper parish and pointier. I put in the Good Thief and I put in the dog, too, because I saw him in my vision. Not my first vision. It's like the stations. My child, were you... Who are you talking to? Our Lady of the Cross. See, that's who she is. Did she say that? Sort of. See, the Good Thief was with her. The Good Thief? You saw the Good Thief? From Calvary. He told me not to tell anybody. From Calvary. It all rings true. Our Lady of the Cross. Stabat Mater Dolorosa. Now, you must tell me everything. Everything. Did she mention the Three Dark Days? Every man, woman, chicken, child has to carry a candle in his hand, and if it goes out... Did she give you any sign, any authentication? She likes Eglish. See, that's why she'll come. She said that? She asked the Good Thief... Will, will ask. The Good Thief. Now, the Good Thief, he's the one here with the beard. I saw him first. He said he was a vision. You saw him? He told me not to say anything. And, and this, this dog. She, she instructed you to put him in, did she? That was the dog that was broken. It was with the Good Thief in Maddie's field. Maddie's field. Maddie's field, Maddie's field. The dog that was broken. This is the language of Revelations. Do you think, if we went in there again, she would speak to you? Speak to us? They're trying to see the Virgin. They're trying to see the Virgin. Over in the chapel. On your knees, see the Virgin. They're trying to see the Blessed Virgin over in the chapel. They're trying to see the Blessed Virgin! They're trying to see the Virgin. They're trying to see the Virgin. Barry O'Neill's seen the Blessed Virgin over in the chapel. Over in our chapel. [COW MOOING] This is the priest. Ask her for a sign. He says I'm to ask for a sign. Is she talking to you? Not yet, I'm explaining to her. He knows, you see. He wants a sign to show you're serious about the grotto, about the design. Maybe you could blink or smile. Oh, okay. What's she saying? Is she speaking to you? Is there a message? You'd better say something holy. MAN: He is the messenger. BARRY: He is the messenger. The precursor even though he comes after. The precursor even though he comes after. He has become, in truth, the translator of the Lord. He's become, in truth, the translator of the Lord. Translating the arcane utterances... Translating the arcade utterances... ...of John and Mark... ...of John and Mark... ...into the forms and structures... ...into the forms and structures... [BUZZING] It stopped. Any sign of my coat? No, and I've hunted high up and low down for it. Well, it's a mystery then. Mrs O'Neill, the most extraordinary thing. It's Barry. Come outside. Quickly! Oh, Jesus Christ, his father's in Cookstown. Is he hurt? Mrs O'Neill, I... Mrs O'Neill... Mrs O'Neill. Your son has seen the Blessed Virgin. -The Virgin? -In the chapel. Our Lady of the Cross. Can I have a glass of milk? Can't come down, I have to stay in. My dad says. I saw her too. She has a big, green coat on. You did not, that was Mrs Ryan. She did not. Everybody wants a look at you. BARRY: Can't come out. You see, it's like when I had the measles. The doctor put me in quar... Clementine, he's in clementine! Quarantine, not clementine. Quarantine. Where is he, Tommy? He's at home, that's where he is. Did he speak? I heard the child spate words a mile long. Mary McKeown says he quoted a legend before McAteer that he'd never heard in his life before. Hey, give us a pint of stout. -That is true, Eileen? -Probably. He sees Dan Dare and the Mighty Mekon, too, you know. Who? Jesus, man, there's some crowd over at the chapel. TOMMY: Crowd? Saying the rosary. [CHUCKLES] I, I, I was nearly roped in. They're digging, too. Digging? Aye, a grotto. So they tell me. A stout and a half one, Eileen. [ QUEEN OF THE MAY PLAYING ON PHONOGRAPH] [WHISPERING] Grotto of ivory. House of gold. I will not keep him away from mass. Don't you see, if we keep him away, it will be the same as admitting... That he's a saint? That this ridiculous thing has really happened. It's that bloody priest, that's what it is. You and him, there's a pair of you in it. Do you know that? [BELL TOLLING] You shall see signs and wonders. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen. My dear people, last week, I spoke prophecy. You will recall my words. I said, "Perhaps the people of the lower parish "are waiting for the Blessed Virgin to appear in person." I used those words, I confess, with irony, my dear people. Sarcasm, my dear people, might be a truer description. And yet, miraculously, that is what has happened. Now, no parish is less worthy than this one, God knows, that could not find the wherewithal to build a simple shrine. Therefore, we can rest assured that we have not deserved this. We should be humbly grateful for it and not proud. For it is not to the proud and the great that she has appeared. Not to a Pharisee or a publican, but to a little child. An innocent child of God. The son of a publican. Tommy. And as proof of her powers, she has spoken words that no child could know. Arcane things, hidden things, difficult things, instructions which he has passed on to me. Signs, literally from heaven, which are taking shape at this moment outside these chapel walls. Now, we must wait for the word of the church, of the Cardinal, to whose authority, of course, I completely submit myself, before we attempt to put a final meaning to these things. But it is clear to me, my dear people, that the Mother of God has spoken to us through the lips of this little child. And that she will speak again. She will not. Listen to her words, my dear people, because this voice, the voice of an innocent child is nevertheless meant for us. It is in truth, the voice of the precursor, though it came after. It is the voice crying in the wilderness. "Prepare ye the way of the Lord. "Make straight his paths." In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

RADIO ANNOUNCER: The property in the outskirts of Athlone was gutted. In Eglish, near Cookstown in County Tyrone, there are claims that the Blessed Virgin has been seen. Large crowds are reported. So far, the hierarchy have refused to comment. That is the end of this bulletin. Now the weather outlook for today, Monday, the 15th of August. Ah! Holy muggers, we're famous. [LAUGHING] Oh, here, your father will be raging. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] [PANTING] Jesus, what a night. Here, have you seen this? -What is it? -It's him, that's what it is. Where'd they get that photo? They call him "Larry". And it's got the text of the Virgin's message. This "precursor" thing. Yeah. Where does he get it? Look at him. I can't get any sense out of him. You won't get any sense out of him if you shout at him. Well, then, what do you make of it? Shh. Do you believe it? I don't know. He saw something. I'm not sure if it was the Virgin. He's very mixed up. Well, he didn't lick that off the ground. He says he definitely saw this Good Thief person. And that he said the Virgin would appear, and then... The Good Thief, that's the yoke they've got up at that grotto, have you seen it? It's partly that priest, you know. He has the child's head put round. Here, let me see that again. "Larry". And they have me down as a small farmer. WOMAN: [ON RADIO] Honestly, I feel awful about this. You've done nothing but work and look after the baby all week. MAN: [ON RADIO] Don't worry, we enjoyed it... I don't want that. Put the Athlone news on. RADIO ANNOUNCER: As outlined in the minister's speech to the Dail yesterday. In County Tyrone, house-to-house searches are continuing as police and B Specials keep up the hunt for two members of the IRA believed to be involved in the explosion at the Territorial Barracks in Dungannon. That is the end of the news. So how is the saint today, then? Your father's raging, we're under siege. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] You should say that to the Lord, now. Yes? It's a collection for Barry O'Neill, for the missions. A collection? To send him on the missions? Can I see that? Do you know what house this is? Huh? They wanna send you on the missions. They're taking up a collection. Go on, away with you. Have they no sense, coming here where you live? Look what they're giving out. Your father will be raging. [CHEERING] It's so exciting! [EXCLAIMING] Come and look. [HORN BEEPING] BOY: Look at all this stuff! There's swing booths and everything. BARRY: I'm not supposed to be out. What if somebody recognises me? Stop worrying, nobody's gonna recognise you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON LOUDSPEAKER] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [ QUEEN OF THE MAY PLAYING ON PHONOGRAPH] -[LIGHTS HISSING] -[CROWD GASPS] GIRL: Is it a sign? It's the flipping B men, they're firing flares. [CROWD GASPING] FATHER McATEER: I don't understand. We know you to be a devout Catholic, Thomas, do we not? I'm not devout, I go to mass. He is devout. Then why? Why this denial? Why this refusal of belief? I don't believe. I don't think anything has happened here. Then explain the vision. Explain the Good Thief. Explain the words he used. Arcane religious phrases no child of nine could know. He's 10. He's just 10, Tommy. He's an imaginative, impressionable 10-year-old. He lives in a world of his own. And he's always spouting big words. I don't know what the half of them mean. I don't know where he got these either, but he got them from somewhere and it wasn't from the Blessed Virgin. So you're adamant, then? You will not let him back to see her. She may have more to say, Thomas. Not to me or you, but to the child. He used the word "precursor". The Virgin may be preparing the way for some extraordinary event through him. Have you ever thought of that? She may, but I doubt it, and not through him. And that is your last word? If you'll not let him come to the Virgin, at least let me talk to him. At least allow the Cardinal's commission access to the child. I will not. Tommy, the Cardinal? If he must. I won't have him frightened, I won't now. I really wonder about that man. WOMAN: Will you bless the poor baby? [BABY CRYING] Bless the baby, will you? Bless the poor baby, will you? [BABY CRYING] I'm not sure I can. [CRYING CONTINUES] Stop it! Get away. Get away from him. The baby's sick, Mary Ward. Take him to a doctor, he's sick! [CRYING CONTINUES] Take him to a doctor. [CRYING CONTINUES] Get away from him! Get away! Get away! How dare you bring him to this place? How dare you? This is sacrilege! She speaks through him. He is her child, hers! [ALL MUTTERING] O'Neill! You have sealed the Virgin's lips! You've made her dumb! [ENGINE STARTING] [CAR DRIVES AWAY] [MOUTHING] Ellie! Ellie! Hey, hey, my knee. Oh, Eileen, oh, God, he's outside. Who's outside, the Virgin? There's no one here. Come, look. I swear, look. You're imagining things again! Oh, Eileen, I wasn't. He was there. Who was? Who was there? The blind man. The blind man, like the Good Thief and the hound of heaven? He was real, he's in a wheelchair. The blind man is real, and the Good Thief. The Virgin is imaginary, sort of. Now I'm just scared. You better stop, then. You better tell everybody. The Good Thief and the hound of heaven, and someone called the Mighty Mekon. I fear we must have a serious talk with Father McAteer. Yes. Father McAteer, indeed. He's inclined to be erratic, if I remember correctly. Nerves, poor man. And he has trouble with his nerves. Nerves or not, he'll have to obey. And the child? The boy? His parents tell me he's going to boarding school in September, to St Patrick's. I know the president well. Father Sheridan. He will see that the child gets over this episode. [CHUCKLING] The Mighty Mekon, eh? I wonder if Mr O'Neill has any decent whisky? Mr O'Neill, Mrs O'Neill. -And our son Barry. -Indeed. This way. Well, how are you? -So good of you to see me. -It's a pleasure. Who was it? Was it Feegan? Was it Feegan? Quentin, I cannot tell you that. It's dead, Quentin. The thing is dead. The Cardinal has not yet spoken. I believe I know the Cardinal's mind on this matter, Quentin. I mean, he will enjoy the school, to be sure, but he will grow up here. And it will be good for him to get away from the, um, events in your parish. And possibly from the influence of your curate, Father McAteer. Hmm, trouble with his nerves, poor man. So they say. [RAIN PATTERING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] I've come to say I'm sorry about all this. I just got scared. See, they took away Barabbas and the dog, but I did see him, I did see the Good Thief. You know that. You know I saw him, don't you? But it's not right, is it? I mean, we have a grotto and all, but Father McAteer isn't happy. And the Cardinal is raging, Ellie says. Dad, Dad is raging. Nobody was raging at Fatima, not even about the Three Dark Days. Will my candle go out? [THUNDER RUMBLING] I wish this could've been like Fatima. I could've seen you radiant, like the children said, with the sun at your feet. See, I did hear you say about the precursor in a special voice, like the radio voice. I heard that, but I never saw your lips move. Not like the Good Thief. I wish your lips had moved. I wish you'd smiled at me, just once. [THUNDER RUMBLING] My dear people, I need not tell any of you how much has happened here in the lower parish this last six weeks. Indeed, there can hardly be a soul in the six counties, perhaps in the whole island, who has not heard of the apparition in Eglish. And now, as you know, my dear people, I have passed no remarks on what has happened here, good or bad. I prefer to wait for the decision of those more skilled than I, more knowledgeable, better guided by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Today, my dear people, that waiting is over. Now, before I read this letter, let me say this. A lot of good has come out of what has happened here. There has been an outpouring of devotion, and that is good. A grotto has been built. Strange design, certainly, but a grotto nonetheless, and that is good. But on the main issue, whether or not there has actually been an apparition here, whether or not the Holy Mother of God, the tower of ivory, has actually graced this parish with her presence. On that issue, my dear people, the church has finally spoken. "To the faithful of Armagh diocese, "and most especially to the parishioners of Eglish. "After the fullest and most sympathetic investigation "of recent events in the parish, "and guided by the Holy Spirit, "I have made my judgement. "That this is not such an instance, "that there is no evidence of direct intervention in this case "by the Mother of God, the most Blessed Virgin, "and that the church therefore requires that hyperdulia, "that special devotion accorded to the Blessed Virgin, "and to her alone, not be accorded in this case." MAN: [ON RADIO] We have this afternoon, first, sitting on my right-hand side, W. Grey Walter. W. Grey Walter is the head of the department of neurophysiology at the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol. What are you listening to? The wireless. EILEEN: Listen to this. [BLUES MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] It's called Radio Luxembourg. Do you like it? I don't want these, Mum. You're taking them. No-one wears long trousers in prep year. They wear short trousers.
