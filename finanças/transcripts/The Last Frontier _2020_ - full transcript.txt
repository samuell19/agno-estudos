The Germans can't get around the bridge. Zajcevo and the Great Subinka they will rest in their swamps. Even if they try, with these little forces ... ... we can fight back. If they cross the bridge with full force ... ... we can't stop them. That's why I suggest ... - ... let's blow up the bridge. - I forbid it. We need the hydra counterattack ... ... when our tanks arrive. I consider it necessary supporting and strengthening the leading team. They have to persevere much longer, as we expected.

See you soon. Why are you sitting here, my dear ones? We don't really know, Comrade Lieutenant. They brought here, unpacked, we've been sitting here ever since. Maybe they'll give us a shovel? It would be a pity, to be honest. Why would you need shovels, huh? Why are there musicians? To be music. They play! They're playing, boys! Let everyone be a little happier. They hide in the first shot to the bottom of the nest and get ready. After the second, they'll take their cannon, and roll out of the nest. "Comrade Colonel, let me ask you a question." - I know... The rules prohibit that the gun leaves the nest. And it's not just you who know it, the Germans too. Sooner or later after targeting they hit the nest. But you shouldn’t be inside at that moment.

Third line of defense The position of Lieutenant Sapovalov. - Let's take it! - Come on! Boys, where is Semjak? There, there. - Hello. - Hello. You see, I'm going to Greater Subinka ... ... with reinforcement. In the end, they just found us busy ... ... we sat here like on a tour. I'll wait for you. Really? Yes. What are you reading? MILITARY RULES OF THE ARMY РККА = Worker-Peasant Red Army Regulations. Oh, Sanya. - Hi. - Hello. You're still there ..., heal. Yes, otherwise we will fight separately. I've been recovering for a long time. Stupidity. They are resting because of a scratch. A little biscuit for the trip boys. I collected it for you. - SHE! - Take it! Thank you, Szany. Here you go, you will need strength tomorrow. Don't think about anything. Szany, we've known each other since we were three. As they say, we grew up in the same sandpit. All over the school in a bench. All the way to "bride and groom." they called us. Mom, I'm sorry. our agreement was unfair. I was afraid of losing Masa, I was mean. I'm sorry. Everything is alright. Why are you saying goodbye? Forget it. You come back and we talk. Don't be afraid, Slavik! They just affect the psyche. Outskirts of Nagy-Subinka village Now they're bombing, and then we'll show them! Fire on infantry! Germans left! - Armor breaker! - Got it, armor breaker! - Fire! - Fire! - Armor breaker! - Right armor breaker! - Got it, armor breaker! - Faster! The cannon is stuck! Simakov, fast! Faster! Slavik, in the ditch! How's it going in Subinka? Your Slavka is great, Raisza Igorjevna. Yes? Yes. Slavik, give me your hand! - Give your hand! I help! - Andrjuha! Andrjuha! Complaint, cover! Do you know a certain Ljusza Siskina? Ljusza? I know I wouldn't know. Where is? In the first line? In the first line? You just drink the tea. Lyush collected herbs for her. And he washed his uniform. Andrush Tkachenko burned. My rifle. Give me my rifle! Add! I killed him, Mitya! I killed him! He burned Andrush Tkachenko, and I killed him! Yes, Slavik. Yes, Slavik, you are good. That's right, right? But say nothing to your mother, rin the end? Of course, we don't say. Don't tell anyone. To no one. If I were still alive. My friend also died at Nagy-Subinka. Ljonyka Zujev. We come from the same village, we went to a school. Fishing. Everywhere together. When we entered the cadet school, his mother hugged us both ... ... and said: "take care of each other". What am I going to write to him now? It has an urgent meaning from Subinka. Sometimes you lose consciousness ... ... and you may die, Comrade Colonel. Filipov is a young political educator. The Germans occupied Nagy-Subinka. I'm sorry. We couldn't hold it. Less than 40 people survived. They're shooting from suburban houses. What about the artillery? They all died. They all ... burned. Everyone is alive! They live in the fire! Ivan! What's going on here, Ivan? What's going on? War. Yes, war? But why only the boys fight in this war? And why not not a word about them in the reports? It was as if everyone had forgotten about them. They haven't seen anything yet. They barely lived yet ... ... the bombs are torn apart, they are burned alive. Is this a war? This is a massacre, Ivan! What are you listening to? After all, no one will be left soon. None of the three and a half thousand! Where are the reserves who do they die for? They do not die because of reserves. Yes. They hold out for Moscow. FOR THE HOMELAND. But why don't you think of them as your home? At least for those who haven't died yet. What do you want me to answer you? I have orders ... to endure to the end. There, under Subinka are the survivors they remain alone ... ... and I have no way to send them help ... ... nor give a retreat order. What else can I say? But they all die. Mind. This is what is needed ... ... in this war. - Where's Siskina? - What? Are you all just shouting, "What, what's up"? Why are you here and not him? Oh, again. It will be good to roll a cigarette. And if you put some in your boots, then it will be warmer. What were you guys talking about? What? A message fell from the sky. "Young red heroes!" "You fought bravely ..." "... but now the resistance it has lost its meaning. " "The road to Warsaw is almost ours." Oh, that ..! Already to Moscow, we're freezing our asses here. "We'll be there in a day or two." "You are real soldiers, we respect their heroism. " Look, they respect you. "Switch to our side." "Friendly welcome, delicious food and you get warm clothes. " Guys,why, then why would we sit? Are we dying of hunger? This is real life! Warm and delicious. They will probably pour a few snaps as well. "These flyers serve as passes." Why, guys? I can't take it anymore. I will probably use this pass. You're not afraid, are you? that the pass was poisoned? Let's look at. Copyright, what are you doing? It's broken! He went to the "Draft" with that paper. Something snapped, brothers. I didn't hit it, did I? - Didn't I find it? - What are you doing, Serjoga? I almost screwed myself up. Don't even think about returning to the line of fire. There is a fight in Subinka. We need free beds. We'll send you back. I can't go back. I have to go to my comrades. I'm fine! What the hell happened? The frequent blast broke the wire, This is understandable. What do you need? Where did you come from, soldier? From Subinka. Everyone died there. Died. Mitya! Mityka! Mityka! You live! You're alive, Mitya! Are you hurt? Mity ... Mitya. Mity! Are you hurt? Mitya, are you hurt? Not a single scratch, can you imagine? Like a spell! This is the blood of Slavik. And even... Is there anyone else? No. No one else survived. Bang! Cadet comrades! Why do they want to be trapped again and go to the bunkers? Why are they unwilling to go to the hospital? You are soldiers. Departure to Podolsk, this is the order. This is my order. Comrade Colonel, Komsomol held a meeting. On the agenda. For the wounded who can hold a gun, their place at the forefront. Here is the decision. We can still fight. If the Germans cross the river at least we can get the bullets. What would be useful in the hospital? If we have to, we die like this, but the fascists will always remember us. So right. We're not going (to the hospital). We do not go. We stay! My children ... I am ready to go with you myself bayonet attack ... ... and I tear up the first bastard, who gets in my way! But our job is to let's not die a heroic death ... ... but let's persevere as long as possible. And for that, we have to stay alive. One more thing. You have to finish your studies, and I have to reach ... ... to be a commander in our army ... ... standing at the head of the batteries we beat the fascists. We have to go, boys.

While you're looking for us, sooner or later he turns around. Have you been to Red Square? - No way. - No goal. I'm from Tula. The Kremlin is there too. Is that completely red too? No, why not?
