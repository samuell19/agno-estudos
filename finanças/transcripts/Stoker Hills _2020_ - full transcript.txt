Stoker Hills Community College. Media Building... - East hall. Fire alarm triggered. Over. - Stay on the line. Yeah, man, they must've updated the autofocus on the S-3. The a7S-2 is much more user friendly. You checked the manual yet? Dude, it's in the menu, it's right here. - All right, this is Film class. - Everything's in the settings. Put your cell phones away. - Ryan, look at you. - And open up your minds. The importance of cinema... Cinema. ...in shaping, reconfiguring, reimagining society cannot be stressed enough. Now we have seen a single documentary... ...force one of the largest amusement park corporations in the world to change its policies and to change global perceptions about whales in captivity. Now we have also seen a comedy almost start a war. Wilder, Walsh, Truffaut, Fellini, Sturges, Micheaux, Parks, Hitchcock, Scorsese. Now those are a few of my personal faves. Who here can tell me who said, "film is truth 24 times a second"? Ah, shoot. "And every cut a lie"? Jake? Quentin Tarantino. Good guess, but no. - Nice try, bro. - Dani? That was French Swiss filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, 1960. Yes, bravissimo. Class, meet Dani, recipient of last year's prestigious best film award. What a surprise. Which you can check out in the display right outside the door. You know what, young lady? I am very anxious to hear about your latest project. All of you. This year, I'm putting together a medical documentary. What's wrong with this thing? I'm planning on getting footage at the hospital... So much for being user-friendly. Yeah, I'm trying to pull rack focus, but I think your face broke the lens, dude. Do you even know what you're doing? Yo, give me that. A rack focus is easy. All you need is an object in the foreground and then you rack focus. Really? How long have you been waiting to use that lame joke? - Hold on, you're not in frame. - Oh, yeah, is this better? Knock it off, man, give me that back. Okay, sorry. I forgot how sensitive you get when you're in love. Guys, unless Erica is in your film and you're starting early, could you turn the camera off, please? Actually, she is the star in our film, Professor. Not that it matters anyways. I mean, how can we compete with a privileged, multi-award winning director like Dani over here? First of all, you could finish your film on time instead of making excuses. Funny. Okay. Quiet down, fellow filmmakers. All right, guys, why don't you break it down for me what your project is about this year? - Okay, so our film is about... - It's awesome. It's basically Pretty Woman meets The Walking Dead. - I call it... - We call it. Right, we call it Streetwalkers. It's about zombie prostitutes that take over a small town. I didn't see that coming. But are you guys sure you're taking this seriously? Yeah, we are, Professor. I mean The Walking Dead is like one of the most successful TV shows of all time and Pretty Woman is like the best movie ever, right? Well, it's not exactly Citizen Kane, but go on. We wanted to make a horror film that would appeal to both audiences. Yeah, like a film my man Ryan here could take a girl like Erica to go see. Thank you, dick, for that very specific example. You're welcome. Okay, all right, well, what's your GPA, guys? Erica, break a leg. Don't worry, Professor. I'll be sure to keep Spielberg and Lucas here in check. Just make sure you eat before you come over tonight. I don't wanna deal with all your hangry energy. Hey, Jake. You know, I can make a darn good zombie for your film project. A good one. She looks like a zombie when she doesn't get enough sleep anyway. Hey, Jake, got any room for me, man? I could totally play a survivor. You could put an arrow through my head, so bad ass. Come on, dude, don't film right now. I have to practice. Dude, you're gonna run into somebody. We're making a movie, I gotta practice. It is impressive to see you multitask. I don't think I've ever seen this before. - It's a lot going on. - See. Positives. Good luck with your Streetwalkers flick. Sounds fun. Just for the record, we're taking home the award for best short. I think you're gonna enjoy my acceptance speech, I really do. You can do a lot better than the zombie prostitutes. Dude, we have to beat her. Dude, her film was dope last year and she deserved to win. Actually we're passing by the reason she won last year. - Oh, gosh. - Who's the school's biggest donor? - You guessed it, Papa Moneybags. - Why don't we just focus on finishing our project this year? Dude, you can't tell me it's just a coincidence. If your dad was funding the program, we'd have the professor in our pocket. You should be careful, Jacob. Professor Smith, I'm sorry, I didn't... I mean, do you wanna risk something terrible happening, huh? You could crack the lens. You left this behind in the classroom. Thank you, sir. I'll be more careful with the equipment. Buona fortuna, guys. Good luck. - Why didn't you warn me? - He gave you the eyes, dude. - Did one of these. - I looked like an idiot. I thought he was gonna punch you in the throat. Yeah, I feel like he already did. All right, let's check this out. Ohh. So clean! Coming, bro. Gosh. And here we have a dumbass in his natural habitat, completely oblivious to common consideration. Dude, what's up? Hey, what's up, dude? Dude, I figured the focus out. Wow, you should really put that in the hands of a professional. Oh, let me know when you find one. Oh, you're funny, fuck you. You ready to go? Yeah, I was kinda hoping to get in the zone first and then see what you had in your fridge for craft service. No, bro, we don't have time. We gotta pick up Erica. - Just smoke in the car, dude. - I am hungry. What about craft service? You promised me craft service. We'll pick something up at the gas station. They better have some fucking taquitos. I'mma be pissed at you. Where'd you park? - Twelve years old, left, dude. - Twelve years old? Dude, this is gonna be bigger than Halloween. I'm pretty sure Carpenter didn't get high when he made Halloween. You don't know that. Come on, dude. What, you don't wanna get high with me? I'm getting high. You're hot boxing me, bro. Well, then I'm a good friend. I'm getting you by contact. - You don't have to do anything. - You're so generous. Yeah, where's my taquitos, by the way? I ain't getting no taquitos. Dude, this is gonna make me even more hungry. What happened to this, oh, I'm gonna quit smoking, dude, I wanna get better? Yeah, I think I was high when I said that, so I don't remember. That stuff stinks. What kind of ganja you smoking? The good kind. It's called OG stank dank. Stank dank? Stank dank. - Come on, dude. - What? If my mom smells this in my car, - she's gonna flip. - Your mom loves me. She's loves me and I love her. - Easy. - What? Can you say hi to her for me? - Frick, dude, I knew I went the wrong way. - You did go the wrong way. What are you doing? We're going to your girlfriend's house. I'm high, dude. He got a contact high from this guy. Does it look good? Do I look good? You do, you look pretty good, dude. - Are my eyes red? - Yep. I was gonna clean my room. - Hey! - Look at the window. How you like my teeth, everybody? Oh, I'm excited. We're gonna do some work. Hey, Emma. Hey, Ryan, can I be in the movie? - No. - Why? Because I already told you no. - There's no parts for you. - We'll get you in the next one. Emma, get in the house. Don't forget to feed Penny, okay? How late are you gonna be out doing this movie thing? I already told you we're gonna be filming for a couple of hours. Hey, Mr. Gallagher. Hey, Ryan. I understand the name of this movie is Streetwalkers. So what exactly is my daughter gonna be doing dressed like she is underneath that coat? Oh, my God. Dad, stop it. Mr. Gallagher, I promise it's gonna be a very classy film. Yeah, no nudity or anything like that, so. All right, just try to remember, she has a little sister who looks up to her, okay? I'd prefer not to be on camera, please. - I'm not recording. - All right, Dad, can you just go inside now? Just leave them alone. Everything is gonna be okay. Bye. - Oh, we'll get her back safe. - Have a good night, sir. No, but for real, thank you for helping us, Erica. Appreciate it. Yeah, it's not exactly a dream role. I mean, it's not fine. She threatened to run away again. I had to talk her out of it. You know, same old story. Word on the street is you're numero uno in theater major. Is there any truth to that rumor, Erica? Oh, dude, they call her two-take Erica because she gives you exactly what you need - in the first two takes. - Okay, no, wait. Actually it's the first take and I just like to have a little fun, have a couple more takes on my hands, you know. Dude, she's got a full ride scholarship - to a big league acting school. - Julliard. Oh, wow, that is big time, so congrats, that's awesome. She's the real deal, man. Dude, that's exactly what we need to take out Dani this year. - I'm telling you, for real. - Oh, my God. She wins best short film every year and Jake is convinced that it's because her dad is... That is the reason, Ryan. I tell you that every time. Dude, what Jake won't tell you is that he and Dani dated briefly and she dumped him. - Wow. Wow. - He couldn't hang. Seriously, dude, that's such a low blow. - What, bro? - Honestly. No, the breakup was mutual, all right? I'm over her. Seriously, everyone just shut up and remain silent the rest of the way and just focus, please. - Okay, so you're gonna go to the second light pole. - Okay. And then you're gonna work that sidewalk technically. - Okay. - Yeah. So how long is this gonna take? Oh, we just need you for a few minutes, babe. - Yeah. - We'll be quick. - Okay, please, just two minutes, 'cause it's freezing. - Yeah, that's fine. Okay, can you help me with my jacket, Mr. Director? Of course, Miss Julliard. Wow! Sorry, Mr. Gallagher, this is not gonna be classy. Yes. I was gonna ask you to be convincing, but I think you got it down, girl. - Work it. Work it. - Do that catwalk. Hey, babe, you're doing great. We're just gonna get some B-roll shots, okay? You said two minutes. Just work it like a Stoker Hills girl. You get what I'm saying? Hurry the fuck up, it's cold out here. Ooh, feisty. Bro, are you texting right now? You're the director. Ryan, a great mind needs great fuel and my mother asked me if she should leave out the lasagna and I replied yes, so. She got enough for me too? Yeah, considering lasagna's typically made in bulk, but we're filming now, so shut the fuck up, okay? Dude, seriously, that's your mom again? No, I sent you a little something. Why don't you take a peek? I didn't get it. Damn, dude, phone's dead. Dude, your phone is always dead. - What's the point in even having one? - Huh. It's a good thing that car wasn't looking for hookers. Hey, I will say though if this whole acting thing doesn't work out for Erica, she has a solid backup plan, man. - Oh, two middle fingers in one day. - Take three, bro. I am on. Oh, wow, I'm on fire. Come on, let's get a little closer. - Okay, sound good. - Rocks up here. You guys, I'm seriously freezing. Can I please be done? - Yeah, come back. - Okay, thank you. My toes are literally numb. No, we can't afford you. I'll buy you a spa day. You can just give me my spa day, babe. You know, give me a nice foot massage after wearing these heels. Okay so the other shots that we have, you're the POV. Oh, no, we should get a POV over. - Oh, shit, hold on. - What? - Dude, this guy's soliciting her or something. - Hi, we're just filming - a movie over here. - Should you say something? Yo, straight up, let's go. - Oh, shit! - Hey, Erica! Hey, stop! Erica! - Stop! - Hey, stop the car! - What the fuck? - The hell you doing, man? - Stop the car. - Hey, dude, stop! - Jesus Christ. - Shit! Dude, we need to call the cops right now. Dude, we need to call the cops. So not a single person was reported missing tonight? No. When did we get this? They found it at the school about an hour ago. Peterson, come here. He's driving an old rusted sedan. It's north of the industrial park. Who brought the video over from the school? We got that from a fireman. Have him come into the station. You got it. Hey, get in touch with the school officials too, would you? - Yeah. - Thanks. Dude, I'm calling the cops. Get in the car, bro. - Fuck! - What? What are you doing, bro, come on. My phone fell down the fucking drain, dude. Dude, we don't have time for this. - Get in the car! - Fuck, I can't reach it, man. They're getting away, bro, let's go. God damn it. This camera, fuck, oh, my God. - Let's go! - Fuck! Open the door, dude, come on. Shit, man. What about your phone? Wait, it's dead, shit! Dude, we need to go to the cops. Dude, we're not gonna risk losing Erica. We need to go to the cops, dude, we need help! Fuck, dude, this is all my fault. It's not your fault. - Yo, is that him up there? - Yeah, I think so. Dude, you need to slow down, dude. - Shut up! - Slow down! - Ryan. - Shut up! Watch out! Fuck, damn it, shit! Shit. Yo, get out, we gotta push. Come on, dude! Okay, I'm going. - Go! - Let's go! Push, man, push! Dude, I'm pushing as hard as I can. Fuck. Push harder then. Still filming this? Yeah, dude, I'm getting this piece of shit on camera. Let's just focus on getting Erica back. Shit, dude, we lost him. What do you think is gonna happen? - What else are we gonna do, man? - Get help. The more time we waste... I've seen those fucking cop shows, all right? The cop show? This isn't fucking cop shows. This is real life. If we tell them that's someone's kidnapped, they're gonna fucking go... This is my fucking fault, man! There, right there. I don't know where else he could've gone. Okay, all right. - Oh, shit, dude. - Easy, it's small. The fuck is that? What the fuck? You think he set this up, dude? Go check it out. There's nowhere else he could've gone. Holy, stop, stop! Yeah, hold on, I think I see him. Let me see. - That's his car, let's go. - No, hold on. That car, it looks a little darker than the other one and it doesn't look like there's anyone inside, man. - Please let's just get the cops. - Shh, there he is. Dude, we really need to get the cops. - I'm not kidding. - No, bro, we're not gonna get the cops. - Why? - There's not enough time. We don't know what he's done to Erica, bro. Are you kidding me? Dude, Jesus. What's he doing right now? Is he getting to Erica? No, what is that? That's a... that's her purse, bro. - Get over there. - I'll get the guys together. It looks like they're about five miles north of the abandoned building. We could watch the rest of this in the van. God, that's not gonna work, the battery's about to go. What, you want me to stay or what? No, you go ahead. I'll get someone to prepare a media transfer and I'll meet you over there. - Copy that. - Keep me updated. - No. - Yeah, let's go. Let's go, dude. There's gotta be a door we can get into. Come on. Dude, come on, let's go. Bro, stairs. Come on. - Come on, dude. - Coming, yeah. Such a bad idea. Yo, that's her. - What? - We need a weapon first. - Whoa! - What? Holy shit! Jesus Christ. What the fuck. Oh, my God. Yo, it's all we got, let's go. Fuck, she's gone. Oh, Jesus. Fuck, man, she's gone! - What? - The hell, Erica. What the fuck? Dude, what the hell is going on here, bro? Oh, my God, dude, we need to go to the cops. Ryan. We need to get the cops. Fuck. This is not good. Oh, shit. Shit, dude, let's get outta here. Bro, let's get the fuck out of here. Please. Yo, Jake, behind you. No, stop it! Stop it! Fuck, what's he doing? He's got a gun. Ryan, we gotta get the fuck outta here. Go! How the hell do we get outta here? Jake, this way! Fuck, go, run! - Fuck, come on, dude. - Run! Shit, car's on the other side, dude. Let's go! Come on, dude, fuck! Fuck, dude, get the hell outta here, go! Detective Adams, drive's ready to go. I'll meet you in the van. Chopper's coming. K9 up here and then up there and then that way. Hey, we just got to the building. How does it look? Oh, we haven't found anything yet, but we just finished our first pass. Make sure you check the perimeter. The kids made it out of the building into the woods. Our guy went after 'em. Did you find any of the cars? Negative, they're both gone. They could be in the lake, call the dive team. The detective just got in the car, so let's wrap this up, okay. - Hey, Bill... be careful. - Yeah? This could be The Shadow. I was thinking the same thing. See you soon. Hurry up, man. So, we'll stay on channel 8. Got it. Okay, thanks. - All right, let's go. - All right, okay, I gotta go. Let's go, come on. I'm dying. Suck it up, don't be a bitch. Oh, fuck, God. We need to double back and get Erica, dude. I think we might've lost him. Ah, fucking hope so. We were moving pretty quick. I don't think I've ever ran that fast in my life. Who the fuck is this guy? I don't know, man. All right, dude. We gotta do something. Let's go back to the basement, get Erica. What if he's not working alone? We need to get help, man. If you wanna get help, that's fine. I'm going back for Erica. Split up? Dude, that's not a good idea. I'm not letting you go back there alone. It's up to you, bro. But either way, I'm going back, all right? Go! Ryan? Ryan? Where the fuck are you, man? Ryan? Ryan, is that you? Hey! What, where the hell were you? - I was looking for you, bro. - I spill my guts on camera. I found something, come on. Almost speared you. What? You okay? No, what happened to your face? Were you crying? What? Were you crying? - Shut the fuck up. - All right, come on. Fuck, Ryan. What happened? My leg's in a animal trap or something, dude, fuck! Fuck this. All right, don't move, ready? Fuck! Fuck! - Wait, it's this way. - Shit. Ah, fuck, wait. Right here, step on this platform, okay? Right here, just step right here. Good. Hold it, easy. Pull out, yeah. Oh, fuck, shit. - You okay? - Yeah. - Can you run on it? - I think so. - All right. - But we gotta move, okay? All right, let's go. - We're close. - Oh, shit. Come on, dude, come on. - Oh, fuck, it hurts so much. - We almost there, all right. Just push through. What the hell? Is anyone inside? I don't know, dude. I came looking for you after I found it. - I don't hear anybody. - Yeah, me neither. Hello, anyone in here? Fuck, dude. Hello? Looks like someone's staying here. Maybe. They're not here now. Maybe we should take a load off and just hide in here for a minute? Okay. All right, just for a bit, dude. Fuck. Oh, God. Dude, doesn't the woods end up at school? Yeah, I think so eventually. All right, man, let's just keep going. Once we get through the woods, we can get to the school, use the phone. I don't think we have to worry about that guy following us though. I know I was wrong last time, but I guarantee you he made it back to the building by now. Like, we were flying through the woods, man. Shit! Shit! - Did you see something? - What? Shh. I think he found us. Maybe it's the guy that's living here, you know. Well, do you wanna stick around and introduce yourself? All right, let's make a run for it, I'm after you. Let's go. Come on, dude, let's go. I'm trying. You gotta keep up, come on, bro. Dude, my leg, I can't. God, I can't move. You can, come on, bro, get up. Let's go, come on, you got it. - Dude, we gotta go. - My leg. Almost there, come on, come on. We got this. This guy must've done a pretty good job cleaning up his tracks. There's gotta be something there. I saw at least one DB in the video. Okay, well, we'll go over every inch of this place. Are you close? Listen, the kids made it out of the woods. It put them over there by Stoker Hills College. They went inside. I'm headed over there now. Have you heard anything from the school officials yet? Nothing. Bill, I'm thinking about the six people who've gone missing in the past month. Half of them, The Shadow went after prostitutes. The other half, three random guys. Yeah, it doesn't really sound like a pattern to me. Well, other than the fact that they're all relatively young and healthy? So you're saying they're not random abductions? No, maybe. Look there's more video to watch. Call me if you get an update. Copy that. Adams? - Dude, he's out there. - What, did you see him? - Yeah. - Did he see you? - I don't know, maybe. - Let's just keep going, bro. Come on. Library's down here. This is it. Go. Gotta be a phone over here somewhere. Shit, dude. Why don't we just pull the fire alarm and then the firemen and cops will come here right away? Yeah, great idea, Ryan. All right, we just gotta find one. I think I heard something. What is it? I don't know. Excuse me, sir. Hey, there's a fire alarm over by him. - Hey. - Could you help us out real quick? Hey, no one's supposed to be in here. - Go! - Go! Come on. Shit! Shit, dude! Fuck! Fast, fast, come on. Locked it. We need to go back for Erica. Like you said, one of the alarms. We saw, there's one downstairs. Shh, don't move. Hear that? Fuck! All right, dude, he's gone. All right, let's make a run for it. No, no, no! He could still be right there, or not. There's another door in the back of this room. Okay, yeah, you're right. All right, let's bait him into this room and make a run for that door, okay? Okay, I can do it. I'll divert his attention to the back door then we can make a run for the stairs. Yo, let me do it, okay? Your leg, you ready? Come and get us, you piece of shit. Shit! Shit! Shit, dude, he's right there, come on. - Okay. - Go! Dude, fire alarm. Come on. He saw us. He's coming down. Shit, dude, come on, let's go, let's go! Just push through, dude. Fuck! Come on, man, get up! Come on. Let's go. Let's go! - Dude, come on, let's go. Come on! - Let's go, let's go. Let's go! Dude, push through! Come on. Come on, the door's right here, dude. Come on. God. Oh, shit. Here. We can get through this door. Fuck, dude. Come on. We gotta get in the woods. I can't do it, dude, my ankle. Come on, bro! Fuck you! Fuck you! Received at 22:45. Stoker Hills Community College Media Building East Hall, fire alarm triggered. Over, stay on the line. Copy that. Let base know we're turning into the parking lot for Stoker Hills Community College right now. - We here? - Yeah. - Sorry, sir. - Jesus Christ. We found a body in the storage closet on the first floor. Looks like the janitor of the building. None of the kids? No kids. Well, they're here, keep looking. Yes, sir. York, send some paramedics to the back of the school. Only one kid at the school? And the body of the janitor. So the kids ran into this room here. York, what you got? We've contacted each of the kids' parents and we had visual confirmation of the girl's house from the tape, her dad's pretty upset. Says he doesn't know anyone who would wanna hurt her. You think this is our guy? Based on his physical characteristics, comparing the street camera to the video, it's him. That means all these missing people, they're either dead or they're here somewhere. So keep looking. Give me that flashlight. I don't think anybody's here. Look at this part right here. Fuck, man, she's gone. This is where the kids go into that room. Look, dude, what the hell's that? Everything looks pretty much the same as it is in the video. What's he got her connected to? Some kind of IV or something? I don't know. It's medical equipment. What's he using it for? Is he trying to take her blood? Maybe he's injecting something into her. Hold on, let me rewind it. That's fucking weird. Nothing, no medical equipment, no IV. Only thing that seems to be out of place is this scalpel. Now, one of the kids found this in the other room when they were looking for a weapon. So he took everything out of here except he forgot his medical scalpel. And this was his only means of defense. Ryan, wake up, babe. Come on, please, wake up. Please wake up, babe. Please, baby, wake up, please. Ryan, wake up, babe, please. What the fuck? What the fuck? Baby, I'm so sorry. No, babe, it's not your fault. I swear it's not your fault. We should never have had you outside. - Babe, I'm so sorry. - No, it's not your fault. - Fuck. - I swear. We just really need to figure out how to get the fuck out of this place. Where are we? I don't know. I was in one building and now I'm in this room. I don't even know how I got here. That motherfucker killed Jake. What? We were running out of the school and he shot him. We gotta stop this guy. What's he doing with your blood? Ryan, I'm so scared, Ryan. Hey, I'm scared too. All right, we're gonna figure this out. You're gonna be okay, I promise, okay? And they came right into here. Yeah, and then they went there. He said they swept this pretty well. - You smell that? - Yeah, that's not good. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. - I think somebody is coming. - Yeah, I heard it. Hey, if he unties you, I'm gonna try and buy you some time. You need to make a run for it. No, I'm not leaving here without you. - Yes, you have to. - No. No way. Didn't see that, huh? I guess they didn't sweep the fucking room. Get some bolt cutters. Mathis! Please, hey, just let us go, all right? We'll do whatever you want. Don't. No, don't touch me. Stop, please, stop. Get away from me, please. Why are you messing with our blood? Please, just get away from me. Hey, if you let us go, I'll get you all the money you need, all right? Look, we won't say anything to anyone. Stop it! What do you want from us? Fuck you, man. Oh, babe, are you okay? Fucking shit. Back out! Back out! Back out! Back out! Well, I guess we found our missing persons. But I don't see any of the kids. Hey, think I found something. Here, let me just open it. "Did I request thee maker from my clay to mound me man? "Did I solicit thee from darkness to promote me "or here place me in this delicious garden?" This guy read books? Well, he must be mad at God or something. Solid print right there. Should bag this. Any idea what this machine does? Not a clue. Well, look at here. Property of Stoker Hills Medical Center. Where the fuck is this guy? Sorry for the wait. Dr. Brooks will see you in a moment. Thanks. Hey, at some point I gotta call Katie and tell her I'm not gonna be home to change diapers. You know, why don't you get outta here? I'll take it from here. I don't want Katie to worry. Are you kidding me? Go home? No. Plus, you think I wanna go home to change diapers? I've never done it, but I hear it's the best part about being a parent. Oh, yeah? It's not. It sucks. I hate it. Hey. Gentlemen, I'm Dr. Brooks. Detective Adams, this is my partner. Detective Stafford. Right this way. Oh, I was told that you found some of our missing equipment. Yeah, I think so. Thanks for seeing us so quickly, Dr. Brooks. Can you tell us what this equipment might be used for? That's for, um, testing tissue and blood. Yes, this was taken from our lab. Why would someone wanna take that? I don't know. Someone who wants to test blood and tissue to find out what type it is, I guess. Based on these photos, could you tell us what this person's trying to do? I don't know. It might be someone who needs a organ donor or has a relative who needs one, it's hard to say. Dr. Brooks, we need all the help we can get. The person who stole your equipment, he's killed six people already. I got two kids, early 20s, might still be alive. Every minute that goes by is a minute wasted. I mean, if you could tell us anything, anything at all. I'd really like to help you, honestly. I have a daughter their age. I could imagine what it would be like to be a parent of one of those kids. If I can think of anything, you'll be the first to know. Doc, how long does it take to normally get back a tissue or blood sample? About 24 hours. If you know how to use the equipment, maybe a couple of hours. Fuck. I know we decided that we weren't gonna do anything for our anniversary, but I was gonna surprise you with concert tickets tomorrow. Yeah? You were? Okay, to tell you the truth, I got us reservations at Sorrento's tomorrow night. My favorite. I thought we weren't gonna do anything this year, babe. Guess we screwed up. We have a dinner and a concert to attend tomorrow, so we gotta get the fuck out of this place. What is he doing with my blood? I don't know and I really don't wanna find out. You know when me and Jake were looking for you in that building? We went into this room, there was a body. His chest was shredded up. If we don't figure out how to get out of this, this isn't gonna end well for us. So it was used as a slaughterhouse. Scheduled for demolition six months ago. - Oh, they're a little behind schedule. - Yeah. Well, I put it in a phone call to see what the holdup is. Let me follow up on that. Thanks, man, good work today. Thanks. I'll be damned if this son of a bitch tastes me out because I don't have a spear on me. I want the record to show that I prepared the best I could. Actually... If this footage ever makes it out... I want my family to know that I love them. I know I was a dick most of my life... ...but, Mom, I want you to know that you did a great job raising me. Dad, I wish you would have visited more, but I understand, I guess. Dani, you were right. I should've gotten my shit together. I didn't deserve you at all. Ry, you're the best friend that I could ever ask for... and I know we don't say I love you and that's not gonna start now, but... you get the point. And if Erica doesn't make it out of this alive, Mr. Gallagher, I'm sorry, we tried. We tried so hard. Hey! - Where the hell were you? - I was looking for you, bro. I spilled my guts on camera. I found something, come on. I can't watch this anymore. We searched every corner of that building, hidden rooms included. But he's gotta be out there, somewhere. We're gonna find him. How's that blood pressure doing? You know, if these pills do what they're supposed to do, it should be just fine... but I've just never been on a case like this before. It's like it doesn't even faze you. Well, of course it does. I can't let the other guys know. But I gotta tell you, this is some of the worst shit Stoker Hills has ever seen. I mean, this guy's like right out of a horror movie. It's hard having faith in a profession like this. I bet it is. - You hungry? - Oh, yeah. I mean, we see everything that's wrong with the world and we're left to clean it up. Well, somebody's gotta do it. There is a special place in heaven for a guy like you. I appreciate you saying that, but I think I'll take my time on that heaven part. You know, you got food, you've got a dartboard and a refrigerator. It's like you live here. Got a gym and a shower as well. All I need is a couple hours on the good old couch. You're the one paying rent. You can do whatever you want. Hey, why didn't you marry Jessica? I was close. But like you said, I live here, and you know Jessica. She was always worried someone'd come knocking on the door, telling her I got stabbed or shot or something like that. I'm not even sure I made the right choice. When you find somebody who really loves you, they're not gonna make you choose between your job and her. This is part of you, it's who you are. These are starting to sound like conversations I have with my therapist. Sorry, I got us off track, I apologize. It's all right. It's kinda meaningful coming from you. I knew there was a reason you convinced me to take this job. All right, enough with the therapy session. That's not gonna solve this case. You think he's actually living in that building? I don't know. We've got no proof that he actually lived there. And I don't think he's going back. He is hiding. - But where? - I don't know. We got nothing from the dive team. Can I help you? Hey. I'm here to see Detective Adams. - Adams. - It's Dr. Brooks. Mr. Books, what can I do for you, Doctor? Can we speak somewhere in private? Sure, right this way. Bill. I think I know who took the equipment. Great, any leads would help. About five years ago, I performed surgery on this patient. Does the patient have a name? He didn't have any ID at the time of the surgery. We didn't have a name, he's listed in the report as John Doe. Then he stole the equipment? Yeah, see, this wasn't a routine operation. We're experimenting with what is called a xenotransplantation. That's animal to human transplant. You're saying you gave this man an animal heart? That's correct. And what kind of animal did you take it from? It was a porcine heart. You mean a pig? Yes. Dear God, did he say a pig? The organ is altered genetically with DNA from the patient. For long term, pigs work well because their anatomies are very similar to human. Sometimes there are side effects, but it's been done before successfully. Well, how is that even legal, Doctor? Every procedure that our research department undertakes is done with the permission of the FDA. Animal to human transplants have been done since the early 1900s. So why did you choose to experiment on this man instead of giving him a human heart? Well, the people we use for these operations have no other option. First, you have to be on a waiting list to receive a heart from a donor. This guy was probably at the bottom of that list. Right now, there are over 100,000 people waiting for a transplant. Eighteen of those will die every day while waiting. If this fellow had waited, he'd probably be dead. Well, that might not have been such a bad thing, Doc. This guy has killed six people in the last month. Listen, you said side effects. What kind of side effects are we talking about? Sometimes the operation doesn't take. Sometimes the body can reject the organ and cause internal issues with the immune system. And what about mental issues? Look, I'm sorry all this happened, but I hope you're not suggesting that the operation had something to do with that. Well, it doesn't seem like the heart's taking too well. He's acted more like an animal than he is like a human. Do you follow up with your patients, Dr. Brooks? We try to. We ask that they come in every now and then so we can check up on them. But we can't issue a warrant or anything and force them to come in. And did you follow up with him? He never came back. I don't know, it just doesn't seem right messing with Mother Nature like that. The point is to save lives. The point is to save lives. And you're pretty sure this is the guy that took your equipment? That's why I came here. I received this note. My daughter Dani wasn't at home. Sometimes she stays at her mother's place but she was with me this weekend. Found a match. Are you sure that there's nobody else that would wanna hurt your family? I received a call from him earlier this evening before I met with you two at the hospital. He asked me to perform the surgery, I told him no. Did he call you on the cell phone or did he call you at the office? My office number. What did he say after that? - I don't know, I hung up on him. - Damn it. And then I got the note. Did you talk to your daughter after you talked to him? Yeah, I called Dani to check up on her right away. She said something about finishing a film project for her class tomorrow. Wait a minute. Did you say your daughter's name was Dani? Yes. Is this your daughter? Yes. Where'd you get this? That footage came from a camera that we found at Stoker Hills Community College. If he was ready for the surgery, that means Dani's collateral. One of the other two kids are the match. We can catch this guy. If we can get a phone tap on his landline, maybe we can trace him down to a location. Well, it's 12:45 right now. It's gonna take two hours. So if we're gonna do this, we gotta move now. What if something goes wrong, will Dani be safe? This is the only chance she's got, Doctor. I'll get the team together. You need to keep him on the line as long as possible. Once we lock the trace, I'll give you the thumbs up. - What if he hangs up? - You can't let that happen. You gotta ask him a question, do something, stall him. I have to go to the restroom. Hey, Doctor, he needs you. And you gotta stay calm. You can't make him think anything else is going on. I really have to go to the restroom. I don't feel very well. Peterson, will you go keep an eye on him? Copy that. You think he's good for this? I hope so. I feel bad about his daughter, but he seems off or something. Let's trace every call coming out of Dr. Brooks' office tonight, right? Got it. It's been about ten minutes. Let's go check on him. Doc, you okay? - Hello? - Dr. Brooks? Jesus Christ. Oh, no fucking way. Dr. Brooks? Shit, fuck! Let's go. He's gone. He took off. Come on. Let's go. Lock down the perimeter. - He's on the move. - Go! Go! I knew something was off with this guy. I don't know if this is a coincidence, but he's heading towards the abandoned building. And we never told him where it was. Oh, shit. Obstruction, pull over. What the fuck just happened? Hey, guys, we're moving in. Karma. What do we do now? Call the dive team. Charles Moyer. He's got a name. He was an orphan, and as an adult, he was discharged from the military because of a mental breakdown. He's wanted in two states, assault with a deadly weapon. So this guy just up and vanished? Yeah, for a while. He worked farmland just outside of town. It's all a big forest now. And apparently, he was involved in some kind of farming accident. Needed a heart transplant. And that's where Dr. Jonathan Brooks comes in. Dr. Brooks has multiple citations on his record. His license was even suspended by the medical board at one point for malpractice. He was on temporary probation. Now, Dani is his adopted daughter. We found signs of breaking and entering at the Brooks home. We even found evidence of a struggle, which confirms the kidnapping. Well, it's great that you guys found all this information, but we still have no idea where the hell this guy is. Okay, well, we got a name and start connecting some dots. We don't have time to connect the dots. He's still out there. We've got people missing. He vanished, he lives here, he drives a car. Come on, guys, I need you to dig deeper. Give me an address. Something. Got it. Remember, I want him alive. Adams. Yeah. They couldn't trace the doctor's phone. Shit. You know what, pull up the video. Go to where they see the mobile home in the woods. You think that's important? Maybe. Shit, shh! All right, pause. Go back a little more. Dude. - Right there, pause. - Hold on. On the counter, can you read what that medicine says? What's that say? Hold on. Cyclosporine? That's the prescription our suspect uses. - God damn it! - He was in the mobile home the whole time. Yeah, but the camera keeps cutting in and out. We're not gonna be able to find it. Even with a search team, it's gonna take a while. Look, we'll have to find some distinguished landmarks. We'll do it in the van, come on. Okay, it's coming a little bit loose. Are there cameras in here? No, I don't think he's watching us. Hey, you almost got it, keep going. Good, you're good, babe. All right. I got it! I got it! All right, we've gotta find something. What is it? What'd you find? You get it? Almost. Hey, you can do it. Come on. Come on. All right, so if he comes in, I'm gonna get him with this. - You're good. - All right. We'll get him to come over by you, all right? He's gotta be close enough. Yo, when he comes in, make sure he's close enough for you to reach, all right? Otherwise don't risk it. Okay, I think someone's coming in, I think he's coming. All right, focus, you got it. Hey, man, fuck you! Stop it! Hey, I'm right here. Hey, let go of her. Please, no! Hey, I'm right here. Fuck, shit! No! Stop it. Stop it, please! Fuck! Baby, are you okay? That's it, just kill me. No! Looks like they're about a mile from the building when the video cuts out. When it comes back on, it's anybody's guess. You know, let me take it a little closer to where the mobile home is. All right, there's gotta be something here. Something that will pinpoint the location. I don't know, certain type of trees, some type of rock formation, anything. It's dark, all the trees look exactly the same. It's like finding a needle in a haystack. We gotta do an overall sweep. I think you're right, we just don't have enough time. Come on, there's gotta be something. He did a really good job of camouflaging that motor home. I don't see how he's keeping three or four people in there. Not possible. Oh, babe, are you okay? Babe? Where am I? I don't know. Where did he bring you from? Who are you? My name's Erica. Wait, I know you, we go to school together. Yeah, you're in my film class. You're friends with Jake. I'm so sorry. Jake's dead. What? How? Baby, are you okay? Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. Dani? Ryan, what happened to Jake? He shot him. Where is he? I don't know. He left and he hasn't come back. Who's he? He's a fucking psychopath. I was at my dad's house, someone came up behind me. That's all I remember. Please, try and get out of those things. God. We're not gonna get any help from this videotape, are we? No. But we're almost there so it don't matter. I guess we'll just have to walk with the other guys until we find him, doesn't look like we have a choice. How many guys we got in search and rescue? There's about five of us, two K9s, an aerial unit. Hold on a second. - What do you got? - Can you rewind that? - Yeah, how far back? - Right there. You see that? What is that, a little red light? Yep, it looks like a tree, like it's going straight down, but that's not a tree. Is that like a tower for light? Yeah, yeah, it's a cell phone tower. How many of those in the neighborhood? Local cell. There's one. All right, bring it in. Bring it in, guys. Yeah, we're gonna go. You guys go three miles north and then cut east. We'll meet you at the crossing, okay? Okay. Hey, remember, we want him alive. I got no signal, man. Ow! Ow! Fuck! Take it easy. Take it easy. You all right? God, that hurts. - You all right? - No! Ow, all right, man. - Take it easy. - No, it's okay. Just hurry up, would you? Fuck! Oh, shit, dude! Oh, shit! Come on, hurry up! Hurry up! Get me out of this fucking trap. Hurry up! Get it, hurry up, open the trap. Oh. Wow. Okay. One of the kids stepped on one of those. That means we're close to the mobile home. - Yeah. - Can you make it? I'm okay. I'm okay. - All right. - Fucking asshole. Let's go. Watch your step. There it is. I think we should wait for the team. We don't have enough time. There's nobody here. Yeah, it's completely empty. Charles Moyer, he still lives here. Well, then there's a possibility that he could come back, so let's wait and ambush him. That's a good idea. I need a verbal confirmation from somebody on the squad. I need a verbal from somebody on the squad, please. It's the storm, come on. Peterson? Ow. Something doesn't seem right. I'mma check the perimeter, okay? Bill, come here. Ow! Shh! Sorry. Get the hell outta here. Look at that. Here, hold this up and cover me. All right, cool. Okay, hold on. Move it, you ready? - Hold on, hold on. - Okay, one, two, three. Whoa, should we wait for backup? There ain't enough time. Okay, just keep pulling. Okay, you've got this, come on. Please. You got this, Dani. Come on, you've got this. Yes. I got it. Ryan. Please stay with us, Ryan. Please, Ryan. Please. Fuck it! Ow! Shh! You shh. Say a prayer for the both of us, huh. Okay, let's go. I can't do it, I can't get it loose. Okay, so then just go and find us some help. Still with us, babe? Behind the chest. What's behind the chest? I think there's a knife back there. Can I cut you loose? I don't know. You might just have to cut the whole thing off. What, I can't cut off your hand. You have to, because I wanna get the fuck out of this place. Hey, babe, no, you can't do that. It's the only way, Ryan. Are you sure? Yes, just do it, come on! - No! - Yes, now! I'm sorry, I can't do it. Come on, Dani. You have to. No, we can get out of here some other way. Okay, I'll just wait for him to come in. When he does. Hey, you have to hit him on the first swing. Stop! Stop! Stop! You see that? Watch out. Watch your step. Ah! There's another one. Oh. Get him, Dani, get him! Come on, Dani, come on! Dani, no! Hey, you piece of shit. Let go of her! Stop it! Dani, Dani, run. Fuck you, man. - Come on, Dani. - Dani, go. - Come on, get up. - Come on, get up! Run, Dani, run! No. Dani! You fucking pathetic creep. Come on, let's see what you got. - Ryan, what are you doing? Stop. - Why don't you let me out of this chair, we'll see who's tough, huh? No! Fuck! Fuck you! No! No! Fuck you! Fuck you! Don't move! Don't move! Freeze! Drop the weapon! You okay, man? You okay? You gonna be all right? - Stay with me, buddy. - You guys, he's getting up! Do not move! Stand down! I know what you want, Charles. What do I want? You want a new heart, but not at her expense. Stand down, Bill. Stand down. We're your friends. I can get you on the hospital donor list... Arrange for surgery. No, he had his chance. Let us help you. You okay? We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Take two. Where am I? You okay? You're underground. How did you find us? The camera, it led us to you. Oh, my God. Hold my hand. Hey. Hey. We gotta get outta here. Come on, we gotta go. Interesante. Thank you. Thanks for cheering.
