Coffee's ready. Now, how about it, Maudie? Ain't ya... just a little bit excited? Oh, a little excited, a little happy. Oh, and tired too. It's just the way you described it, Ralph. Where we gonna put the house? That's gonna be just up to you, but there is a pretty spot just over that hill there. There's a brook just a-curvin' and a-turnin' through it, with thick green grass, pretty shade trees... and soil so rich you could grow all the flowers and vegetables... you had a mind to. Here comes our boy. Didn't take him long, did it? How'd it go, Son? Fine. The barbed wire'll be delivered in the morning. The lumber's gonna take about three more days.That's all right. - Ma, how about some coffee? - Oh. Comin' up. How'd you like that little town? Well, I learned a lot of things you forgot to mention. Like, for instance? Like, for instance, a man by the name of Ben Blazer. Ben Blazer? I believe I met him. What about him? Well, he's the biggest man in Gunsight, and right now he's the maddest. They say he's boiling because we're moving into this range. Well, he's got no call to be mad. This range is all government land. I filed my papers. I paid my money. It's mine. That's the law. I know, but they-- they say Blazer thinks he's the law. And he hires a lot of men-- men who carry these things. You tryin' to say something? I'm trying to say we need more men. Men with guns. Earl, will you put this back on the fire? Yes, ma'am. Put that thing away. Here you are. I'm gonna have another cup of that too, Maudie, if it's all right. Best coffee in the territory. Thanks. There they are-- all those cattle... belonging to a squatter who needs a lesson. He's gonna get spanked hard, or my name's not Ben Blazer. I got my paddle, Dad. All right, men. Stampede! Let's go! Dad! What have you done? You murderer! You murderer! You murderer! You murderer! Pa? Pa? I'm hit bad, Son. Hang on, Pa. I'll get you to the doctor. Well, what do you think, Doc? Well, your father's still alive, but I don't know how. I also don't know how he survived the ride into town. I want to talk to you. Anything you got to say to me, say it when Dad can hear. It can't wait. You're comin' over to the office with me... and tell me what happened this morning. I heard that, badge man. I don't like it. You... wanna keep your job? You leave my boy alone. You made a little mistake. Only an inch, but a mistake. Bob! Son! - Read it for me, Doc. - Stranger challenged. He went for his gun. What we call around here a fair fight. All right, you. Come with me. You-- What's your name? Taggart. Do I get hanged or shot in the back? Taggart, huh? I heard what happened to your father. Did you hear what happened to my mother? And an old man? Did you hear that they were killed by that thing I shot in there? No, I didn't know about that. Gunsight's a nice little town. If your name is Blazer, you kill who you want, when you want, how you want. Gunsight's a town run by one man-- Ben Blazer. If he lives and you're here, you'll hang or get shot in the back. You, Taggart-- You get outta town. Now, get beyond all maps and stay there. Don't thank me. Don't say anything. The longer you talk, the longer you're in town. Good-bye. Send all three telegrams, Doc. The one to Jay Jason, that's the most important. I just did something decent, Blazer. Time for me to retire. Mornin', stranger. My name's Jay Jason. Nice day, huh? Hadn't thought about it. Other things on your mind. I know how that is. What's the matter, cut your head? Did you fall and hit a rock? Or maybe a bullet crease, huh? I'll take a look at it for you. I'll take care of it. You're a man of few words, mister. Now, me, I'm just the opposite. I talk too large and think too small. You better watch that cut. It might infect. What do you want? Mister, you are a man who minds his own business. Opposite of me again. All I wanna know is, is that the right road to Gunsight? - You're on the right road. - Well, thanks. I'm obliged. When you do talk, you say the words a man wants to hear. Now, you take care of that head of yours, the only one you got. If it starts to infect, trouble. How long, Doc? Hard to say, Ben. If you rest and don't get excited, there might be a miracle. I don't believe in miracles. Howdy, men. I'm lookin' for a Mr. Ben Blazer. I'm Blazer. You Jay Jason? Most of the time, dependin' on the circumstances. Glad I didn't stop for a short beer. Might have been too late. These two men be workin' with you. Big one's Vince August. Other's Cal Dodge. Well, you two purely ain't the gentle kind. Three of us, Mr. Blazer. You got wholesale slaughter in mind, huh? Name's... Taggart. Killed my son. I want him dead. Only one man? Mr. Blazer, you hollered me and these two... to terminate just one man? Now, that ain't good business. My time is valuable. I don't work for whiskey money. Five thousand dollars... for the three of you. You mind repeatin' that, sir? Five thousand. Well, now, Mr. Blazer, you're clearly a man of substance, and I withdraw what I said before about, uh-- But we've still got a little problem here. Now, a fact's a fact, right? And your, uh-- tenure on this planet is just about ended. How are we gonna collect our proper pay... once the job is done? I thought of that. I told the banker. Show him proof, any evidence of Taggart's death, he'll give you the money. This-- This here's a warrant for Taggart's arrest. It says "dead or alive." You can stop readin'... when you get to "dead." Now, you men get out. Now, Ben, I told you-- Talk quick, Mr. Blazer. You're dyin' fast. Taggart-- Where'll we find him? I don't know. - Well, what's he look like? - Young. Tall. Black hair. Black hair. Did he maybe-- now, just maybe-- have a cut on his head... right here? That's him. Kill him! Kill him. Kill him! You can die contented, Mr. Blazer. Some days are just better than others. No question about it. Tell me something, Doc. Is he wearin' his boots? Get out! Jason! Where you two been? I been waitin' and waitin' for you. You're a liar. Of course. Of course! But not where money's concerned. Now, I ran into Taggart right here. Didn't know who he was then, of course. But between the three of us, we ought to be able... to run him down like a stumblin' steer. Dodge, you go that way. And, Augie, you go that way. I'll, uh-- I'll try the road up here. No. Between the two of you, there ain't one ounce of faith in your fellow man. You should not even be inside a place like this. You are-- Well, you are a lady, Mrs. Manners. No lady's as desperate for work as I am. Listen to me sing. In high school they said I had the prettiest voice-- No. No, please. For the last time, please. I haven't got a job for you because I haven't got any customers. Look. Look. If I had some customers, I'd giveyou the money. All of your dancing girls have left town. You couldn't keep any customers if you had them. And I'm supposed to have pretty limbs-- legs. No. No. Please! Look, Mr. Guiness. A good day to you, senor. What is your pleasure? Whiskey. This, uh, town is nailed tighter than a strongbox. Where can I get some food supplies? Oh, I can sell you a little coffee, jerky-- things like that. Thanks. What hit this town anyway, an epidemic? The same thing-- Apaches. Those Apaches are raiding, burning, killing, and they are supposed to be coming this way. You would not like to buy a cantina real cheap, huh? I'm afraid to make an offer. You'd take it.I would. Oh, I would. Senor, I got no bartenders, no girls, no customers. Things are so bad-- My, you're tall and handsome. Only you look like all your puppies got distemper. Buy me a drink and I'll listen to your troubles. If I buy a drink, maybe I'll forget them. What's your name? Mrs.-- I mean, Lola. Just call me Lola. What's your name? Taggart. Thank you, sir. You're not exactly an old, hardened drinker, are you? It was my first ever. But I'll learn. Um, you said "missus." Mrs. what? Mrs. John Manners. My husband's dead. I'm sorry, Mrs. Manners. We had a ranch south of here. Then the Apaches came. They killed John. He hid me first. They never even saw me. And that's why you're working here? I just started, as if you couldn't tell. Mr. Guiness over there doesn't want me, but I need money something awful. How much money? Thirty-two dollars. That's what it costs to take the stage north to the first town. That should be enough for your fare... and a couple of days' expenses. Give you time to find a job you can handle. Oh, please, mister. I can't take your money. I can't-- I can't be obligated to-- to go through with-- I-- All you're obligated to do is to smile pretty... and say thank you nicely. Thank you. Thank you very much. Call it a loan or a gift. Anything you like. Barkeep, we're lookin' for a man named Taggart-- a tall young man. I think I recognized his horse over in front of the store. Could you manage to point him out... in this crowd of roisterous merrymakers? Why, I declare. I don't know when I've seen two more handsome men. Well. And I declare I can't remember when I'veseen two more handsome-- Hold it. Let's hear those guns bounce off the floor. Do what the man says, Augie. Some days are worse than others, and there's lots of tomorrows. Back away from those guns.Yes, sir. At your service, sir. Want me to stand on my head? Anything to oblige. I hate to involve you, Mr. Guiness, but could you sit on these guns for a couple of minutes? Give me time to turn my back and ride out of town? My pleasure. A couple of minutes? Take 10. Take 20. Taggart, I'm not a petty man. Besides, I want a drink. Get out of here, Mrs. Manners. You are fired. Oh, thank you, Mr. Guiness. Hold him right there. He's headin' south. What's in that direction? Apaches. Apaches! That Taggart. He sure makes it hard to earn a living. Go get our horses. Augie! Check that. Hot, huh? That means Taggart can't be too far away. Ah, he rode out that way. Still headed south, like geese in the fall. And still headed for them Apaches, who'll kill him for free. Us too. Oh, well. Get back on your horse. Welcome, stranger-- and that's sincere. If we're lucky, they'll kill him for us. What we do, Augie, we wait and see. Forget wait and see. Taggart, I'm just as embarrassed as you are, us being on the same side. Just keep your gun shooting in the right direction. Ma'am, I've purely got to congratulate you on the way you handle a gun. Why I never saw such--Jason! Drop your gun. Drop it. Wh-Why-- Why sure, Taggart. That's the way you feel about it. Changed my mind, Taggart. We'll do things just like you said, only backwards. Or do you want to see a woman killed? You let her go! - Let her go. - Do as he says, or he'll kill her. Drop it. There now. Taggart, you're too close. Move off a bit. That's far enough. You people got someplace to go? We were heading for Fort Wetherbee. Fort Wetherbee? Best place for you. On your way, both of you. What about our guns? Suppose we meet more Indians? Maybe you won't. Maybe you'll be lucky. Come on, Jed. Now. I told you, Augie. Some days are better than others. I still don't know what you're going to get out of killing me. Money. We're businessmen, Augie and me. We get $5,000 for sending you up to rattle St. Peter's gate. That Taggart. He acts like he wants to live to be a dirty old man, full of rheumatism and false teeth. But he's got no gun, and he's gotta be around here someplace. There! Missed him. But he can't get far. No horse, no gun, no nothin'. Jason, I'm hurtin'.That's 5,000 markers down there. Augie, you're a boil on the heel of progress. You can't afford to drag behind and hurt, not now. - Who are you? - Give me my gun back. - What are you gonna do with it? Shoot me? - I don't know. I just might. Let me know when you make up your mind. - What are you doing here? - Well, I-I-- I was just-- Listen, mind your own business. What are youdoing here? Apaches. I'm trying to stay out of their way. Hey, keep your hands off me. You've got no horse with you. And you were perched up there like an army sentry guarding something. What's up here? Listen, mister. Why don't you just saunter on back to where you came from? I told you. Apaches. I'll take a look myself. Drop that rifle. Go on. Drop it. Pick it up, will you, Miriam, please? When I saw him comin', Dad, I-- I was gonna shoot to scare him, but I-I thought that-- I know. You were afraid you were gonna hit him. All right, mister, what brought you up here? Apaches-- Down there. They're out there. I saw them. You, with no horse, no gun? No. If he has, I didn't see them. What are we gonna do with you? Put that rifle down, and I'll answer you. Your answer would be wrong. Walk, mister. Come on. Miriam, stay behind him, please. Hold it. Hold-- That's my fault. I should have stopped you sooner. Put it back, will you, Miriam? Yes, Dad. Step across that brush. Looks like you didn't intend to have any unexpected guests. We weren't expecting anyguests. You're the first person that's blundered up here. Give me a horse and a gun, and I'll blunder out again. How did you know we were up here? I didn't. What makes you think there's a horse and a gun up here? When you're running from Apaches, you don't stop to think. You just hide. I wish I could believe you. Move on. Who is he? What does he want here? I'm not sure. Inside. An old mission? Yes. Abandoned and long forgotten. Inside. - What's your name? - Taggart. Doesn't that thing ever get heavy? I'm Consuela. This is my husband, Adam Stark. And Miriam. She is my step-daughter. Well, Dad, whether you like it or not or whether he likes it or not, Mr. Taggart's our guest, and it's time to eat. Of course. Will you fix something, please, Miriam? Yeah, that's the problem. You see, you keep a prisoner, you gotta feed him. Well, we'll eat in a few minutes. Thanks for offering to help. Wish I knew what I was gonna do with you, Taggart. Any woman would know what to do with him. Jason. Jason. Help me. Help-- Help me, Jason. Look at you now. $5,000 runnin' around here someplace, and what do you do? No, Jason. No. Augie, be reasonable. You're no help. You're a hindrance. If I just left you there, you'd probably die, but then I'd never be sure. I'd spend the rest of my days wondering if you were still alive... and lookin' for me with a gun in your hand. No, Jason. - Uh, no. - Right? Mr. Taggart? I wish to talk to you. I can help you to leave this place tonight. - With a horse and a gun? - Yes. If you will take me with you. Why? Because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the Apaches. I'm afraid of the Apaches too, but, uh, I'm sure your husband will protect you. He's too old. But you-- You are young and strong and brave. A woman knows such a thing. He's not that old, not the way he handled me. I would be good for you. Good to you. You don't think me desirable? Desirable you are, Mrs. Stark. But if I'm gonna get into trouble with a woman, at least she won't be married. With me you would not be in trouble. With me you would find happiness-- happiness and great wealth. Wealth? Tell me the rest of it-- the real reason you wanna leave here. It is that a woman like me deserves more than a snoring old man. I deserve a young man-- strong, like you. We can have riches beyond count together, because I know where to find it. Sleepwalking, Consuela? Perhaps you are jealous, angry... that I was the first to visit Mr. Taggart in the night. No. Not little Miriam. So cool and so cautious. And how very tempted you must be... to tell your father where you found me tonight. But you would not, because you would do nothing to hurt him. We know each other too well. Good night.Good night, Mr. Taggart. Did I interrupt something tender? Is that what you had in mind? Yes. My father loves Consuela. God knows why, but he does. And I won't let her near you again. A horse and a gun will solve that problem. Make you happy, make me happy. I'm not Consuela. I didn't come here to please you... or me. I'm just trying to help. You know, there's something I can't quite believe about you. Oh, is there? I can't believe that you're as... cold and cautious... as Consuela says you are. Are you? Good night. Stark! I couldn't shoot. I was afraid of hitting you. How did you get out? The window. I'm glad I didn't think about that. Taggart, I guess I was wrong about you. All I can say is thanks. Can I have a horse and a gun now? Mister, if I had 'em, you could have an artillery piece... and a team of thoroughbreds to pull it. Come on. I'll show you what I'm doing up here. Gold? The Los Padres Mine. Been abandoned for years. And that ought to crush out at almost 50% pure gold. It's the richest I ever heard of. So this is why you didn't want anybody up here. Can you blame me? No. You're gonna be a rich man. Oh, it's not for me. I just wanna make Consuela happy. She's beautiful, vital and young, and, well, she hasn't had much happiness being married to an older man. No excitement or thrills. Hardly a romantic life. But now I'll be able to give her everything that money can buy. I know maybe money isn't everything, but it's the best I have to offer. And I don't know what I'd do if I lost her. It's time to quit, get far away from here. Why? Well, that Indian probably had friends. Maybe a lot of them. When he's missed, they're gonna come prowling around. Miriam and Consuela are alone. We better get back. Hold it right there. Stab me if it ain't you, Taggart. When I heard that tin bucket a-bangin' and a-clatterin', I knew that somebody someplace would be waitin' for me. But who would ever expect to find you here? You would. Who's he? Jay Jason at your service. Inside. Kind of reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, Miss, with me down here and you up there. I'll wager you're even prettier when you smile. You see? I was right. Inside, Jason. Oh. Do I detect a note of jealousy in your tone, Taggart? Oh, I tell you, I wouldn't-- All right. Am I actually meeting another beautiful young woman... away out here where nothing grows but tumbleweeds and Apaches? Shut my mealy mouth. It's missus, not miss. If she's your wife, mister, all I got to say is you're a man of large luck. Consuela, go upstairs, if you please. What's he want? He's a professional killer. He gets $5,000 for killing me. Mister, what Taggart just said is half the truth. There's no denying it. But the other half-- the part I didn't hear him mention-- is that he's wanted for murder, and I'm hired to get him. Now, you look to me like a reasonable, law-abiding man. And I'm not asking you to take my word against his. Here is proof. Here's a warrant empowering me to get him dead or alive. Taggart. You saved my life this morning. Still, this looks legal. Looks legal? Islegal.However, I do not approve of any instrument... that encourages a man to kill for profit. Therefore, I'm not gonna permit you to enforce your warrant. - What do you wanna do with him? - I'd like to shoot him. - We'll tie him up for now. - Tie me up? Mister, it's a true fact. There's an awful lot of awful mad Apaches paddin' around. If they ain't sniffed you out here yet, they will tonight or tomorrow, and you're gonna need anybody who can shoot, including me. We'll have to get that warning bucket back on the rocks. I'll stand guard tonight. Both of us. We'll try to leave early in the morning. Keep him covered while I get a rope. Anything out there? Nothing so far. Apaches aren't supposed to attack at night, but I'm not sure they know that. Well, it'll be light in a half hour. I'm gettin' the horses ready to leave. Hot coffee. I want my guards to stay awake. Thanks, Miss Stark. Why don't you learn to say Miriam? While he's learning, why don't you get anything ready that you wanna take with you. Oh, I am ready. Miriam. Um, about that warrant-- I guess I owe you an explanation. Oh, don't say anything. I believe more in a man than I do a piece of paper. - Good night. - Good night, Miriam. Taggart, you married, engaged, anything like that? No. Nothing like that. I'll be out front. Quiet. We do not want the others to hear. I'll be as quiet as a church mouse. A mission mouse. But what is it we don't want the others to hear? Private, secret things. Now, there's nothin' better than coo-talkin' with a lovely woman, but it's kind of a handicap being tied down. I want to hear what do you have to say without a handicap. Let's save the talkin' for dessert. You can have me... and own me... and take me away... with more gold than a man can dream. You're talkin' about paradise, you gorgeous, beautiful-- Gold? How much gold? Very much gold. Five thousand dollars many times over and over again. Where? I will tell you where there is everything we need-- horses, guns and the gold. Where? And you promise that we share the gold together? Of course, my darling. Of course. The gold would be worth nothing without you. Where? The stable, in the back. Come quickly and quietly. Let me look first. Adam was out there a few minutes ago. Look in there. Now, tell me about my beauty. There's never been a beauty like yours, Consuela, and never a woman with such grace, such charm. Consuela, what are you doing out here? Looking for you, Adam. I couldn't see you in the front, and I was worried. I'm all right, but you better get back inside. I do not wish you to worry about me. Get inside and blow out the lights and stay there. Those Apaches-- They got a solid sense of the right time and the right place. I'm frightened. - Can you see 'em? - Not a thing. Maybe they willhit us tonight. Maybe. Everything's so quiet. Do you think we ought to take a chance and leave? Well, not seeing Apaches doesn't mean they're not around. Yeah. I know-- Get inside. Go on. Get inside. Now's our chance. Dad. We beat 'em off, didn't we? Let's get him inside. Get some clean cloth, Miriam, some alcohol. Or whiskey'll do. Consuela! Consuela. Consuela! Is Consuela in there? Here, Dad. Take a good swallow of this. Where is she? Answer me, Miriam. Where is she? I don't know where she is, Dad. The bullet passed straight through. It left an ugly slice that'll-- Well, it'll really hurt, but I think that's all. You two know something that I don't? She's gone. Jason's gone too. So is the gold. Jason forced her to go with him. I'm going after them. Oh, easy. Easy, Dad. I'll have to bandage you first. You'll help me, won't you, Taggart? We're going to Fort Wetherbee, all of us. I gotta go after them. Where do you think he's taking her? With Apaches running around, Fort Wetherbee's the only place he can go. No one in sight. It's a terrible thing, but I'm afraid that your gallant husband's wounds were fatal. I'm afraid that you are a widow. A wealthy widow. I shall have closets bursting with silks and satins. I shall have diamonds, furs, a shining black carriage with matched black horses-- stallions prancing with their heads high. Your crystal ball must be cracked. What happened to me in your future? But my future is yours. My heart is yours. You will have all the luxuries you desire too. But most of all, we will have each other. Till death do us part? Exactly. Now we seal the bargain? Sealed, signed and delivered. We better keep movin'. Taggart. I don't believe that Jason forced Consuela to go with him, do you? I know he didn't. And you know that when we get to Fort Wetherbee... that Jason will probably be there? You don't sound so... cold and cautious anymore. But it's true. He'll kill you if he can. Miriam, when a man knows something's wrong, he usually backs away, leaves it alone. Now, that's what I've done with Jason. But I'm not doing that anymore. Not now. Get your father, and I'll meet you out front. I'll scout on ahead and make sure there are no more Apaches. Watch for my signal. Some days are better than others, Consuela. And today's one of the very best in recorded history. That there is the U.S. Calvary, herdin' settlers into Fort Wetherbee. We'll join 'em and ride in safety. Your thoughts are many miles from here. You're lookin' into that closet full of silks and satins? No. We are safe now, true? Stop fretting and frowning, my lovely. We've got a lot of guns on our side now. Start smiling again... and dreaming about all that jewelry you're gonna buy. Later. Now I'm thinking about my future. Our future. Remember? My future. And I don't see you in it. You've forgotten our bargain... and how we sealed it. I'll purely enjoy reminding you. When we reach the fort, we will say good-bye. You're so long on beauty... and so short on memory. "But most of all, we will have each other." Do you remember saying that? I changed my mind. That's all. We made a promise. Till death do us part. My pretty one, you'll keep that promise. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, Apaches. Where? There's hundreds of 'em right over that hill. And they're headin' this way. Look to the other side. Take 'em ahead! Form a circle! Caravan, ho! Get down! Get down! Help me! Please help me! Get back. Get back in the wagon. Help me! Did you find her? No. You found something. I saw some Apache sign. We'll ride that way to avoid them. Consuela-- Tell me the truth. She's dead. - How? - You don't wanna know. - What about Jason? - No sign of him. Can't you see anything at all, Sergeant? Nothing, sir. Nothing at all. Here comes one man, sir-- a civilian. He's ridin' fast. What have you seen? A lot more than any man's supposed to see. Well, what? Indians, everywhere, all headed this way... like they were starved and the dinner gong rang. Will you give me a couple of fresh horses fast? I want distance between me and here when they arrive. Did you see any cavalry patrols or soldiers with wagons? No patrols, but I saw soldiers and wagons along with civilians, all being slaughtered. You've gotta give me fresh horses. You ain't got enough soldiers to protect this place. No horses. You'll stay and fight like the rest of us. Here come three more civilians, sir! One of them's a woman! You'd better get him inside.I'll be all right. I'm well enough to shoot a gun. Colonel, I'm-- I'm looking for my wife. Beautiful, young, dark-haired-- There'd be a man with her. I'm sorry, sir. I haven't seen her. All right, soldier. What did you see out there? Dead soldiers and dead civilians-- What's left of some burned wagons. His wife is dead, only he doesn't know it yet. See a cavalry patrol? No, sir. No patrol. - Here come the Indians, sir! - Close the gates! Women and children inside! Miriam, you better go inside, honey. I'll do what I can to help out here. Where's Consuela? Where is she? Dad! Dad. Miriam, take care of Consuela. Promise me. Take care of her.I promise. Troop "B" comin' up to the back gate, sir! Open the rear gate!
