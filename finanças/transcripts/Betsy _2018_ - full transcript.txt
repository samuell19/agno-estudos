Large coffee, black. All right, will that be all? Actually, I have that instead. All right, 3.80. Here we go, yep. And I'll give you that. Really? What? It keeps your hand from being scalded. They teach you anything in the academy. Oh, I've been out of it for 25 years. Did you get that report done on that accident? I did. Didn't you see it this morning on your desk? Did you type it? You put the handwritten one on my desk. What if the reason I do that is to give it personal flair because I'm trying to build my brand within the force. You know that. You're not gonna believe... Hey, Kayte, how you doing? Oh, my favorite dynamic duo. - Hi, boys. - Hello. So how's it going? Oh, you know, just another lovely day in paradise here. And who's this? This is my very good friend Betsy. Hello. Yeah, her and I actually grew up on base together. Ah, another army brat, huh? - That's right. - Cool. So what brings you here to our little slice of heaven? I... No, it's actually a much needed change of scenery. You know what, how about you go make sure Hunter isn't burning down my coffee shop? Okay. It was nice to meet you both. Yeah, it was nice meeting you. All right, what's her story? Okay. So this can't get around, okay? Guys, about three weeks ago, she was severely attacked. She... She was attacked? Yeah, some lunatic just jumped her when she was walking home, and just, and when I say attacked her, he almost ripped her throat out. Jesus. Okay, so she's been through a lot, right? And she's here for a fresh start and she's staying with me. I'm just trying to make her feel at home, okay, so you guys can just keep an eye on her with me. - Absolutely. - Yeah, she's cool. Yeah, just kind of make her feel comfortable. I'm looking at you. Cool as ice. Okay. Is she okay? No. But that's okay, because I'm here for her and now you guys know, so. Yeah, we don't wanna hold you up anymore. Yeah, yeah. I've got a business to run. Sorry guys, but I hope to see you soon. Yeah. Okay. - Yeah, we'll see you. - Okay. Thanks, guys. Do you think they caught the guy? Guys, don't you have anything better to do with my tax dollars? Hey, Sam. - Hey, hey, Ranger Rick. - Hey. Catch any beavers today? Yeah, yeah. What's going on, guys? You still coming over for dinner tonight? As long as you're not cooking, yeah. Hello, what can I? Sorry, what can I make you? I'll have a large black, three sugars. Here you go. - Thanks. - Have a nice day. Horror, I really like horror. - Okay. - What? - I bet you do. - Thanks, man. Hey, what's with the new girl? That's Kayte's friend. Her name is Betsy. No. What? I've seen that look before. What look are we talking about? Oh, that look. That one right there. It's the same one you had the first time you laid eyes on Jenny Jenkins. - Okay, here we go, yeah. - Who? Jenny Jenkins? - Who's Jenny Jenkins? - Stop. Jenny Jenkins was his middle school girlfriend. - That is, until he... - Oh, come on, man. He caught her giving Brandon Prewitt a hand job at the skate rink. All right, great, thank you. It was a blowj, by the way, but gentlemen, have a nice one. Ouch. - He's crazy. - Some kids never learn. That kid. I'm getting better. I'm looking at this as a positive thing. You know, I survived something I never thought I'd have to. You're right and that's a really great way to look at this, and I think it's very brave of you to say that in front of a group of strangers. Thank you. Well, I want you all to know that you're survivors. You have lived through some terrible things, and you're here, you're alive, and you're safe, so please feel free to continue to share, and speaking of sharing, I think we have time for one more, so I think we'll give our newest member here a chance to speak, if she likes. If you're ready, of course. Hi, everybody. Hi. I honestly have no clue what to say. That's fine. Why don't you start with your name? Hi, my name is B.. Kayte. My name is Kayte. Share whatever you feel comfortable sharing. Don't feel any pressure. A little over three weeks ago, I was attacked. I was walking to my car and somebody grabbed me and drug me into the alley and then they... I ended up spending a week in the hospital, and I came to this area a few weeks back and now I'm living with my friend. The doctor told my friend, Betsy, that I should seek therapy and they didn't find much around here, so that's why I'm here. That's all I really have to say about that right now. Well, that's perfectly fine, and Kayte, you're welcome here, so thank you for coming back, and if you feel like you just need to sit and listen more, that's great. Take your time because this is your second visit, so just wait until you're comfortable. All right, everybody, well if you remember, our first meeting next week is on Wednesday, and if you haven't done so yet, please stop off an update your contact info on the group's phone tree. I like to be able to get ahold of some of you, and we will just, I'll see you next week, okay? Goodnight everyone. There she is. Oh hi. Hello. How was the meeting? It was fine. Oh, heads up. - Hi, Kayte? - Hi. I noticed when you were on your way out that you didn't stop and give us your contact info. I need that if you wanna keep coming to group. Is it all right if I get your number? Of course. Okay, what is it? It's 515-432-6189. Okay and I just wanted to thank you for sharing with us tonight. I know that that was hard and I'm assuming that this is your friend Betsy. So you seem to be doing some great things for her. - Hi, yes. - Hi. - Betsy, nice to meet you. - James. James, oh hello, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Yes. So I guess I'll see you next week. - Of course. - All right. Have a good night, Kayte, bye, Betsy. It was nice to meet you. You too. So Kayte how do you spell that? I panicked, okay? All right. Are you ready to close up shop with me, then. - Yep, let's go. - Okay. So Kayte, you wanna tell me more about the meeting? Never gonna live this down. No, never will you live this down. Jillian, that was amazing. Oh, thank you, Sam. Did you hear that, hon, amazing? Baby girl, he ain't saying anything I haven't said before. So... Sam, seeing anyone yet? Not at the moment. What? Well, our friend Sam here fell in love at the coffee shop today. Oh, do what, with who? Who said anything about love? Kayte's friend? He gave her the look. The Jenny Jenkins look? Yep. Oh my gosh. Well, what's she like? I didn't give her any type of look. He's blowing this way out of proportion as usual. Well, describe this alleged look. It wasn't a look. Yeah, there was, the glossed over eyes, his mouth open a little bit. Ooh, that's precious. Did he get really dumb suddenly too? Yep. Aww. So, Sam, we actually just left off at you not got giving this mystery woman the Jenny Jenkins look, but you actually did give her the Jenny Jenkins look, continue. She's cute. That's all I can say. She took my coffee order and that was the extent of our talk. Such bullshit, man, I was there. I saw it, it was like love at first sight kind of shit. Oh wow. Oh my gosh. Okay. Wow, look at the time. I must be going. - Oh, well. - Jill. - All right. - As always, thank you. - Hey, it was fun. - For dinner. - It was great. - Good seeing you. Thanks for coming over. - Collin. - Yep. - Good seeing you. - Yeah, you too. - That was fun. - Jenny Jenkins look. Aww. - Hopeless romantic. - I know. What is happening? Shit, shit, shit. B, come on, we're gonna be late. Betsy? What the hell? Oh my god. Oh my god. Betsy? - No, no. - Hey. Hey, hey, come on. Come on. - No! - Oh my god. Oh my god, Betsy. It's just me, it's just me. Look at me, look at me. Look at me. Oh, my sweet girl, it's just me. Oh god, come here. Come here. Oh. Hey, what's going on? Huh, talk to me. What's going on? It's just a bad dream. I think you should stay home today. - No, I'm okay. - Yeah. I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. Okay. Betsy, you're not okay. You're not okay. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Well. God, I'm running really late. So... You stay home, I can go to the shop by myself. No big deal. You stay home, you rest. It's not a big deal. It really isn't. No, I just need to shower and some fresh air and I'll be fine. I'll be fine. - I'll meet you at work. - Betsy. I promise, I'm okay. Are you sure? Yeah. 100%. Of course. Okay. I love you. You call me if you need anything. I know. - Okay. - Okay, okay. This is Sam. Yeah, I'm headed out to Sycamore to set up those trail cams. Okay. Yeah. Hey, you need a ride? Hello? Ugh, that's a little fucking rude. Hey, bitch, do you need a... Fuck off, douche bag. Is there a problem? Are you okay? What was that about? Some dick tried to pick me up. But you're okay? Yeah. So... So... So how long you been working for Kayte? About a week now. And you? Oh, no. I'm just a game warden. I make sure that all the hunters are playing by the rules. They have their licenses and they're not poaching, but I also study the habits of the animals. Sounds interesting. Not at all but thanks. You have a beautiful smile. All right, here you go, you're all set. Hey, Betsy. Yeah? Are you busy tomorrow night? I have a thing. Thursday night. She's free. Yep, Thursday. Food, do you wanna get dinner with me? This is where you say yes Sure. That'd be great. Awesome. Eight o'clock? Yes, eight's good for her. I can be here or wherever a little bit before eight. I don't know if here or here... No, Sam, come to the house, to the house. Okay, thanks. I'll see you at eight then... Eight o'clock Thursday. Yep, cool thanks. - Okay, bye Sam. - But... Bye. Oh, what? Betsy... You picked her up on the side of the road. Porn movies start out like that, man. I know, right place, right time, I guess, plus some fucking creepy guy was trying to pick her up, I think. Oh, you were her knight in shining armor. Three shots of vodka, please. So wait, you said some guy was trying to pick her up? Yeah, I don't know. It was weird. Did you get a good look at him? I guess, good enough to know that he was fucking wicked creepy. Guys, I can't. - Yes, you can. - Yep. Here is to friends, family, and to Sam getting back in the saddle. Fuck you. Another round, please. So can you give me a description of this guy? About five ten, dark features. Sunken eyes, really fucking spooky. You think it might be him? What? It's Walt Delaney, man. Have you heard the story of Walt Delaney? No. All right. Four years ago, he beat the hell out of his girlfriend. I'm not talking about like love taps or anything, I'm talking reconstructive surgery. It was brutal, real bad. This guy put her in a coma for two weeks. He damn near killed her. Jesus Christ. One more please. There you go. Oh my god, it's so cold in this house. Oh. What movie do you wanna watch? Oh, I don't care. Doesn't matter to me. Can I talk to you about something? Yeah, yeah, of course. So Sam... Do you, what do you think? Sam's great. No, no, Sam's a really good guy. But... What's wrong? So I know that I've been kind of pushy with Sam. - Just a little bit. - I know. I know. I guess I just need to make sure that you're ready. Ready for what, exactly? I have no idea the emotional toll and your experiences and what you've been through. Betsy, I can't even imagine that kind of pain. And I love you very much. And I just need to be sure that you're gonna be okay with getting involved with someone again. I appreciate that. Yeah. I think I'm ready. But just to let you know, I totally approve of Sam. - Really? - Yeah, I do. He's so cute. Oh my god. He makes me smile. That's good. I haven't smiled for a while. Yeah, you're right and you deserve that. Do you know what you're gonna wear? I have the perfect dress. Get this guy out of here. Oh man. I'm gonna grab on this side, you catch him when he comes out, all right. On it, we are on it. Let's get your feet. - No. - Gotta get the baby. No, no. All right. - You got the door. - All right. Night, Sam. Good night. She totally wants me. All right, Sam. Let's go, let's go. Come on, big guy. Three is a crowd, boys. Yeah, right? - Oh. - He is not light. - Oh, right on, man. - What are you doing man? I'm taking off his delightful Robin's egg blue boat shoes is what I'm doing. Oh, yeah, you gonna get him off next. Hey, listen. Let's just, let him pass out. He won't remember any of this. Let's get out of here. Jesus, Betsy, what the hell is wrong with you? God. I'm so sorry. It's fine. I was waking you up 'cause you were screaming. I'm so sorry. No, it's fine, it's fine. You have group in an hour. Okay, what? Yeah, you, god. You slept all day. God. - Just... - I... No, get ready real fast. Just take me to work and then you can take the car to the meeting. I'll just get a ride home from Hunter or someone. Well, it's a pretty small group tonight. Some of you know, this happens. You know, people come and go. You'll see that a lot. That just goes to show that everyone's dealing with the things that happened to them in their own way. Everybody's at their own stages of recovery. That can be very lonely and frightening thing, feeling. You might be experiencing residual shock, confusion, being overwhelmed. It's all completely normal. It's like your body is detached from your own mind, and your body's doing one thing while your mind is trying to process everything you've been through. Then you find yourself at the same place and you start thinking about the act or acts that happened to you. I know that at one point in time, the three of you have had to have asked yourselves all of the obvious questions like, "Why did this happen to me? "Did I do something to bring this on myself? "Why didn't I resist or fight harder?" And... "What sort of persons could do this to someone?" But ask yourself how long will it be until I start feeling like myself again? How do I shake this sadness, this darkness? Will I ever be able to put this shit behind me? It's all normal. It is all normal. And that this group, with time, can help you to get to that closure to be able to move on, to stop whatever's holding you back. You forgot to mention loss of appetite, that's probably the worst. You're right, I did. Loss of appetite is the worst. Loss of things in general are common, though, loss of appetite, loss of sleep, the loss of will to do even the most basic things, the things that once came to you second nature like going to the grocery store, the library, it's too much. You can't do it. I know a lot of members that have come and gone from this group and have lost their jobs because of the things that have happened to them and their inability to continue forth. What about dreams? Did you forgot those, too? No, bad dreams are totally normal, completely common. Sometimes survivors even relive the events that happened to them in their dreams. Are you experiencing something like that, Kayte? Not specifically, I just wanted to know if dreams were part of it. Oh. Well, Leslie, Kevin, do you have bad dreams? Yeah. Normal. Not alone. You know, after what you've been through, though, Kayte, nothing is normal. Are you sure you don't wanna talk about it? No, I'm fine. Okay. Every day is a step to overcoming these obstacles, these things that have been built up in your minds now because of what you have been through, but with time, it is through this group that you can heal and find your closure and move on, so if anybody else has nothing to share, Leslie? Kayte? Kevin? Well, then I'll let y'all go for the night and I will see you next week. Shit. Hey, Kayte. It's Betsy, I just got out of my meeting and the car won't start. I guess I'll walk. Bets, you got this. Fucking bloody nose. Oh my god. This is Sam. Yeah, what's going on? Another deer. Oh. Okay, where? All right, man, I'm on my way. Good morning. Good morning. What you making? Eggs. I just thought it'd be nice for you to wake up to breakfast for a change. Huh. Okay. I just want you to know how much I appreciate everything you've done for me. It's okay. Not a big deal. Came out to have a smoke and take the trash out and there he was. What time you think he found him? I don't know, right when I went on break about nine o'clock. You have any problem with animals? No. Like animals getting in the dumpster or something? No, not that I know of. Stay right here, I'll be right back. I don't know. Looks like it could be though, right? What kind of animal could do this? What would be big enough, a dog? Will you go get Sam? - Yeah. - Thanks. Hey look, I gotta tell you something. This is a potential crime scene, okay, and I called you for a couple of reasons. I just want you to know, it's really fucking gross over there. Jesus Christ, Colin, is this a homicide or an animal attack? You tell me. Jesus Christ, man, that's... Yeah, Walt Delaney, piece of shit. That guy over there found him when he took out the trash this morning. Well, it's definitely an animal attack. You're positive? Oh, yeah. Well, it was definitely a large canine type animal. You can tell from the bite marks. There are some big dogs around here. Maybe a pit bull? Or what about that Cane Corso over on Maple? No. What about bobcats? I know you said something about some bobcat sightings. It's too small. This animal is definitely way larger than something that would be hanging out by a dumpster, you know what I mean? I'd learn towards a small wolf to be honest with you. A wolf in Ohio? You're fucking with me. No. Like bobcats, they've been sighted here too. In Michigan, in Kentucky. It's not out of the ordinary for being transient pack animals like wolves are to travel long distances to forage for food or prey. Fuck. This isn't good, Sam. Sorry, man, it's just what it looks like to me. You call the coroner yet? Yeah, Bob's got a funeral. He'll be here in a little bit. Sup guys? Awe you look so good. Oh, you know what, though? What? Go into the bathroom and get that brown headband that I have. Good idea. Aww. Sam's here. - Have fun. - Bye. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Oh, shut up. Wow, this looks delicious. Would you like some wine? Yes, please. Go ahead, dig in. This chicken is delicious. So, how long you been in Brookhaven? About three weeks now. Kayte and I's dad were stationed together here. Army? Yep. So why'd you come back? If I tell you, you have to promise me not to treat me any differently. Are you dying? No. Okay. I promise I won't treat you any different. I was attacked three weeks ago. I had scratches all over my body and there was blood everywhere, and when I woke up, Kayte was there. Jesus. I'm really sorry. Really, that's terrible. Enough about me, what about you? Other than my job, I don't really do much. I listen to the radio. I hunt. I play the harp, but I'm kind of a homebody, I guess. I'm a homebody. At least now I am. Me and my friends do go out to the bar every once in a while though. The cops that were in the coffee shop the other day? Yeah. They're in there a lot lately. So are you. Only recently. Oh. Did you find a good drink that you like? Something like that. Hey, honey. Are you all right? I heard about what happened in town today. Yeah, I'm fine. Just doing some research for my case. Ugh, wolves? That's weird. Did you know that wolves will travel 10 to 30 miles a day just to search for food? Why are you researching wolves? Well, it seems like I'm dealing with, by what Sam says, an animal attack by a large canine. So like a wolf? That's what Sam thinks it is. But what do you think it is? Just because it never has happened here doesn't mean it couldn't happen here, but I don't know. Plus the victim was missing his pants. That's weird. Yeah, it's suspect, right? I think it could have been a human that did this. Really? Jill, he was just torn to shreds, just bad. Oh my gosh, can you tell me who it was? Walt Delaney. Well, I mean, one of those girls could have gotten back at him. Serves him right. Yeah. Walt Delaney's a strong guy. I don't think it was a woman. I'm not really concerned with him. What I'm concerned with is that there's something or someone doing this in my city. I can't have that. Yeah, that's so weird. I'm gonna go take a drive and clear my head. Okay. Don't be gone long, okay? - I won't. - All right. I love you. I love you, too. Do you mind if I put some music on? Go for it. Hey, chief. How's it going? It's just not right. What's not right? A wolf. Traveling all the way here and killing a man. Couldn't it have found some other prey in between here and wherever the hell it came from? Well, couldn't Sam be wrong? Coroner came to the same conclusion. Those hair samples that we collected, they were fur samples. A fucking wolf. A fucking wolf. You good to drive, chief? Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. Okay, have a good night. Yeah, you too. See you tomorrow. Hey, wait. Why didn't it eat the guy? What? Sam said wolves travel great distances to hunt and eat. And? It didn't eat the guy, just killed him. Why wouldn't it have eaten him? I'll see you in the morning. All right, have a good night. See you tomorrow. Hey, Betsy, it's Sam. I didn't hear you leave this morning, so... I just wanted to let you know I had a really good time last night and I hope everything's all right, so... When you get this, just give me a call. Jill, what's wrong? Sam, it's so awful. Colin called, Dusty's dead. Wait, what, no. The wolf attacked him. Jill, where's Colin? In the woods, outside of town. - Is he in danger? - I gotta go. I'll call him from my truck. Get this door locked and stay inside. So she's... There. But... Fuck it. Betsy? Colin. What the fuck are you doing out here? Colin, it's Betsy. What's Betsy? Betsy's responsible for all of this. What do you mean? I thought you said it was a wolf. If you trust me on anything, please let this be it. All right. Betsy! Betsy! Betsy. Betsy, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Colin, no! This is Sam Harper. I'm about a mile off Snyder Road. Chief Rogers is down. I've got two more bodies here. Stay on the line with dispatch. They're coming to help. Wait. Don't go after her. Sam! Hold me. Such a beautiful smile. So do you. Betsy? Sorry, Sam. Hey, can I help you? Excuse me? That's my car you're leaning on. What? You're fucking dead. No. You're dead. Welcome to the club, Kayte. Subtitles by explosiveskull
