[MUSIC PLAYING] [EERIE WIND] NARRATOR: Some say he was born in the back of a pickup truck. Some say it was a highway reststop. And some say he was belched full-form from the chrome exhaust of a dead-headed semi. But wherever he came from, he was destined to become hell on wheels! [ENGINE REVVING] It's the story of-- [GUNFIRE] --Baby Bullets, too young, too tough, too fast. [ENGINE ROARING &amp; TIRES SQUEALING] Aahhh! NARRATOR: It's the thrilling story of a talented toddler and a gift that would come to haunt him. [EXCITING MUSIC] A piston-packing hard-riding highway-hustler in Pampers, who didn't know when to stop. [SIREN] [ENGINE REVVING] It's the story of Baby Bullets. He'll crawl out of his diapers and drive right into your heart. [TIRES SQUEALING] [BABY SQUEALING] His daring will amaze you. He lived fast and loose and grabbed love where he could. [BABIES GURGLING] And soon, it was the mob that wanted him. There's only one driver good enough for this job. Bring me Baby Bullets! NARRATOR: He was the dangerous darling of the mob. And they called him the Babe, the Bambino. This infamous infant would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. [TIRES SQUEALING] Don't worry about a thing. I'll take care of it myself personally. [BABY CRYING] I promise. OK, OK, just take it easy. Take it easy. It'll be done. [BABY GURGLING] Baby became the talc of the town, until he took a powder. He must be stopped! Bring in the infantry! [BUGLE &amp; MARCHING] [BABY CRYING] NARRATOR: Explosive drama so exciting you'll spit up. [BABY COOING] [BEEPING] [BABY COOING] So you won't talk, eh? [BABY GURGLING] Baby Bullets-- the real story of the hot tot the top cops hop to stop. [TIRES SQUEALING] [BABY CRYING] Baby Bullets-- they couldn't hold him. They couldn't scold him. They couldn't even burp him. [GUNFIRE] [BABY CRYING] "Baby Bullets," the only movie that has to be changed four times a day. [MUSIC PLAYING] Please read this aloud. For far too long, a very special segment of our society has been excluded from the motion picture going experience. Now, for the first time, the producers are proud to present a motion picture equipped with blind-o-vision, to assist our blind audience in the enjoyment of Gena's story. [MUSIC - PIANO] NARRATOR: "Gena's Story," or "On my Own," "By Myself," "Just me," "Alone." WOMAN: Up yours. NARRATOR: Finally, a serious woman's picture. Meet Gena, independent, cosmopolitan, and loving mother of two. Meet the husband that leaves her-- Call my secretary. We'll have lunch. NARRATOR: --the lover that finds her-- Ugh! NARRATOR: --the lover that leaves her, and the liver that loves her. And introducing-- What do you want [INAUDIBLE]? NARRATOR: --Henri Henri, as Jacques Perrier, the other man, every woman's dream, bearded, tender, and naturally sparkling. Perrier knows how to make almost any woman feel nearly human. [GROANING] Oh, oh, oh. Oh, Jacques. Oui. Jacques. Oui! Jacques! [HEAVY BREATHING &amp; GROANING] JACQUES: Oui. Oui. GENA: Oui, oui. JACQUES: Yeah. GENA: Oui, oui! JACQUES: Oh, yeah. [INCREASING PANTS] Yeah, yeah. Can I put it in your [INAUDIBLE]? Oh, put it in, Jacques. JACQUES: Put it in! Put it in! [PANTS AND GROANS] Oh, aahh! NARRATOR: It's only a story. Her loves, her lives, the things that make her special, make her unique, like all of us. [LAUGHTER] And the encounters that send a message to all of us. Oh man, what do you want me to do? I told you, I can't-- say, w-- why, she was talking on [INAUDIBLE] phones, right? Cops and-- lay-- uh-- yeah-- writing, right? Scratching. And uh-- writing. And it's like people in a circle, right? There's like four or five people there. I'm getting it now, right? And uh-- more writing. Yeah, like-- NARRATOR: "Gena's Story," a story for this time, next time, the time after, the time after that, and always. [INAUDIBLE], right? And dancing! And she's dancing. Like, she's got panties on. I'm on a roll now, right? She's got panties on. And like, behind in the picture, it's like a loft, man. And it's like pretty floors, wood floors, like they been sanded, like in the last-- and it's a coffee table. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG HOWLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: All his life, they said it was going to be tough. But everything still kept coming too easy. Bobby, I want to tell you something as a friend. Yeah? What's that? [BLEEP] you. [BLEEP] you! [MUSIC PLAYING] An important new motion picture in black and white, from an award-winning director. A film of the most profound dimensions, the most moving experience ever put on film. [TOILET FLUSHING] [BURPING] You talking to me? You [INAUDIBLE]. You got something to say to me? Well, I got something to say to you. [BLEEP] you. [BLEEP] me? [BLEEP] you. Yeah? [BLEEP] you! The [INAUDIBLE] saw Fontaceli walking down the street. NARRATOR: "Raging Bullshit," a picture so profound you'll rediscover emotions you've never had. --[BLEEP] you and the horse you rode in on! Huh! [BLEEP] me? No, you got it wrong. [BLEEP] you. Martin Snorzeze's "Raging Bullshit." Bobby became a winner, because he had nothing left to lose. Bobby-- [WHISTLE] ----[BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP] you. NARRATOR: "Raging Bullshit," the man, the moment, the movie. [BLEEP] yooou! [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BRAKES SQUEALING] [CAR CRASH] [LAUGHTER] MAN: What are you, deaf? You [BLEEP]. [BLEEP] you! No, [BLEEP] you. [BLEEP] you and the horse you rode in on. [BLEEP] you, you-- [BLEEP] you. Van Waspishes, what you got? Meatloaf. How about you, O'Mally? The usual. Doesn't get you down, O'Mally? Being an unimportant part of something so big. I mean, don't you think there has to be something better than this city? Better than this job? Better than this speech? Sometimes, I think about building something for my family and me, far away from this contained giant they call the Big Apple. Hey, cool it! Here comes the foreman! Van Waspishes, what the hell are you doing eating? You know you're not supposed to be away from the asbestos machine. How many times I told you? I want you to eat, drink, and breath asbestos. What does it take to get through to you? Wait a minute. Let me try it this way. (HIGH VOICE) Van Waspishes, you eat asbestos, you drink asbestos. And if I ask you, you sleep asbestos. (BURLY VOICE) You got it? Yeah, I got it. In fact, I've had it. I've had it up to here, with this job, with you, this whole stinking city. I quit, you understand. Take care of yourself, O'Mally. New York, for once you're going to listen to me. [SIRENS &amp; JACKHAMMER] And one more thing-- [LOUD CITY NOISES OVER SONG] PS, and I'm never-- [LOUD CITY NOISES OVER SONG] Right, give me one with everything. [HORN] -You got it. [FALLING NOISE] Greg and I worked together for the last two years on construction. Now, this-- this construction site was definitely run by the mob. I mean, it was organized crime, you know? Anyhow, uh, these were rough guys. I mean, really rough. If they knew I was here right now telling you this stuff, they-- they'd kill me. And they wouldn't think twice about it. Now first, let me make something clear. Greg didn't know anything about the mob. Greg didn't know anything. Christ, we had to put a label on his hammer. Anyhow, every morning at 9 o'clock sharp, this bag-man-- uh-- Vinny Tanucci, he shows up. And he goes to our foreman, right? Now, I never heard anything that they said. But, uh-- [DOOR OPENING] --there was always passing-- DELIVERY GUY: All right. Deli delivery. Who gets the turkey sandwich? [SQUAKING] Hey, I-- I got anoth-- I got another run. [INAUDIBLE] And Joey Clamento was there and-- DIRECTOR: Hey, kiddo, watch that-- get away from the lights. [SMASHING SOUND] Anyway-- DIRECTOR: Watch the lights! Hey, wait a minute! You told me there wasn't going to be no lights! Come on. [GUNFIRE] MAN (ON INTERCOM): --are there to stop shopping cart theft. They are there for your convenience. The metal poles outside the supermarket are there to stop shopping cart theft. They are there for your convenience. MAN (ON INTERCOM): --Elu Belictor, Dr. Elu Belictor, please report to salad surgery. Dr. Elu Belictor. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, baby. Take a look, baby. Take a good look, baby. [BOWLING BALL ROLLING] [BOWLING PINS SCATTERING] Baby, baby, baby, hey! Ba-- MAN (ON INTERCOM): Attention editor, attention editor, will the editor please come to the dentist in aisle 5. Thank you. Pardon me. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] We just ran out at the office. I've got a root canal in 15 minutes. Special today, only $1.79. Also, the pharmacy department special. For your housewives, it's valium at three for $1. And the family special, quaaludes, all-you-can-eat for $3.75. [BELL RINGING] WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Check out lanes 3, 4, and 5 are backed up and-- You know, Millie, I've been noticing recently, food just doesn't taste the same any more. I don't know. It's not as fresh or something. Maybe I'm wrong. But I really worry about my family's health. I mean, all the sugar and chemical preservatives they're forcing you to eat cannot be good for you. No, I guess not, Mrs. Van Waspishes. Do you have anything smaller, Mrs. Van Waspishes? How about if I fold it in two? That's a good one, Mrs. Van Waspishes. [LAUGHS] Thank you. So long, Millie. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] What? Did you break up this pound of butter? You sick-- now, go put it back where it belongs. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] (SINGING) to get to aisle six-- No, don't push all right. -[MOANING] -Come on. Hang in there. Hang in there. Did we make it? Will we make it? What do you mean, no? [SINGING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] MAN (ON INTERCOM): Metal poles outside the supermarket, are there to stop shopping cart theft. They are there for your convenience. [MUSIC PLAYING] I greased the old man $1,000 and his kid five Reggie Jacksons. BAMBI: Want to party? Nicki, sweetheart, I told you, they're paying $5,000 a head for white women in Juarez. I know, I know. Last year, we got $6,000. But the peco is surging. Come on, Teddy, let's party. LITTLE BILLY: Look, just give the babes to the border, and I'll take it from there. BAMBI: Yeah, oh, Teddy! Uh, excuse me, Bambi. Would you hold it down? Some of us are trying to work over here. Why don't you grow up? Don't be a jerk, it's deductable! Beside, name me one 11-year-old that gets sent up on tax fraud. Am I right? Daddy, Mommy! Daddy, Mommy! Bambi, Little Billy, I've got something to tell you. [RECORD SCREECHING] Your father's gone crazy. You remember your father? Now, I want you to listen very carefully to what he has to say. I did. And it didn't make any sense to me at all. Maybe you can do better. Greg. Kids, your mom and I love each other very much. [WHIMPERING] Grow up, mister! Your mom and I have been doing some talking. And I've got wonderful news for you. We're going on an adventure. How would you like to wake up to the sound of chirping birds? To look out the window and see fields of wild flowers and clover? [LOUD MOTOR] How would you like to drink-- [SIREN] --pure fresh air? And breathe crystal clear water? What I'm trying to say is that, from now on, you don't have to worry about crime, pollution, junk foods, loud rock-and-roll music, X-rated movies, or drug pushers ever again. Kids, we're leaving the city. And we're moving out to the wilderness! [WIND BLOWING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUFFLED SHOUTING] BOY: Look, a deer. This is great, isn't it? Come on. Up and out. Isn't this great? Just look at those mountains. Take it all in. That's it. Didn't I tell you this? The great outdoors. We're here at last. You got to leave the kids in the car. Don't lose the ticket. Pay as you leave. [RADIO PLAYING] GREG (VOICEOVER): Our adventure had begun. I hadn't seen such wild and untamed beauty since the Gabor sisters sang "Let's Get Physical" on Merv. It didn't take a genius to see we needed a roof over our heads, and we all pitched in to make it happen. Well, this is the big moment. What do you think? Huh? GREG (VOICEOVER): And darned if we soon didn't have a fine little cabin to show for our efforts. And a 17 and 3/4 percent floating mortgage, and just a quarter of it. There was hard work, but there were also the good times. Time for fun and relaxation. [WHISTLE] Come on, kids! Greg, come on. It's time to come in. GREG (VOICEOVER): Especially after Mom vacuumed and chlorinated the lake, and installed that Electric Poolmaster surface cleaner. I rediscovered something I had forgotten-- animals were attracted to me, and for some strange and magical reason, felt no fear when they were around me. Animals just plain liked me. [ANIMAL CRIES] MAN: Mr. Amsterdam, we're trying to find out why the family moved to the wilderness. Could you tell us a little bit about, uh-- Greg? Yes, I remember Greg. I remember a lot of thing you'd be amazed, little things that people forget. Like, uh, how many of us remember that Eleanor Roosevelt had great tits? Or how many people stopped to realize that if things continue the way they are, in 10 years from today, Czechoslovakia will still be hard to spell? Little things, like, uh, the man who walks in the men's room, and there's a hole in the wall, and there's a little sign over it, says put your prick in here and we do for you what your wife does. So he put his prick in there, and somebody sewed a button on it. BILLY: Back to the Earth? Bullshit. Come on. Selling the house and moving the family out to the wilderness was my idea. Look, sweetheart, Look, sweetheart, in the bracket Greg was in, he couldn't live in the city anymore. He would have gotten killed in taxes. Hey, did you see his return last year before I got a hold of him? It's a joke. So I sat down with him, and I told him to move out to the woods. You can appreciate everything. Trees, possums, the works. Clarissa, honey, be a doll and get ma coffee. Sweet and light, all right? Listen, pal, can I ask you if you happened to noticed if Greg saved the gas and toll receipts? From LA? OK, right away. Hang on, will ya, babe? GREG (VOICEOVER): And I'm here to tell you that old lady mother nature even worked her charms on me. I was feeling a new vitality-- a vitality I hadn't felt in years. The mountains, and all that hard work brought out something in me, and I loved it. But unbeknownst to me, there was a strange, unseen watcher in the woods-- a watcher whose very presence would have struck fear into the heart of any red blooded American male. But the most rewarding thing for me as a father was to see how naturally my children adjusted to life in the wilderness. You're a big one, aren't you? [ELEPHANT ROARING] Well, it was nice to meet you, but I have to be going now. Have a nice day. Sorry. Mother told me never to go out with circus people. Besides, who knows where that thing's been? Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Well, the Russian revolution, the whole of Europe was affected by it. You know, Lenin, he was living in Switzerland, so whenever you felt like, you dropped in, you had coffee and cake for nothing, practically. For nothing. In the summer, of course, we went in for the air conditioning. So the girl says to the doctor, doctor, what is a phallic symbol? He said, you're kidding. She said no, I don't know, what's a phallic symbol? He take his pants down, he points to himself, and he says, you see, that's a phallic symbol. Oh, she said, just like a cock, only smaller. MAN: Mr. Amsterdam, what-- [ROARING] [BARKING] Squirt? Go get help! [BARKING] Oh, you're hurt, you poor dear. All right, OK! I'm sorry! Oh, you're hurt, you poor bear. GREG (VOICEOVER): I guess Bambi just naturally inherited her helping and healing ways from her mom. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Let me see your pa. GREG (VOICEOVER): And it wasn't long before she'd taken that thorn out of the bear's paw, and found herself a new friend. Now, I bet that feels better. I'll bet you're a Capricorn. How do you like that? GREG (VOICEOVER): And it was obvious that that old bear had taken quite a shine to our little girl. My diagnosis was the daughter was suffering from a classic case of arthogenetic transference, and that clearly the pathology lay with the entire family. I wanted to treat them together. Take on the whole family's neurosis. Man [INAUDIBLE], I said. I'll cure any psychosis, anytime, anyplace, anywhere. I'll meet them at my office, Madison Square Garden, the Olympic Auditorium, Tokyo, Japan. Anywhere. You know what I'm talking about? I try to tell each person I fix-- Bambi, the daughter, displayed severe confusion in her sexual role model identifications. The family began to resist my treatment. I couldn't believe it. Look, I said, I'll get you on a couch and reshape your cognitive perceptions so you can't tell it from your super-ego system. I'll take the id and put it where the ego is, and by the time I get through arranging your id and your ego, you won't know which end is up. Then if you still haven't stopped supplementing, I'll print you all a-- [SHOUTING] Look! Look, you pencil-necked geeks! I was the inter-collegiate psycho-analytic champion, in the welterweight division. And I've got the belt here to prove it. If I were to take this gold and melt it down, all you [INAUDIBLE]! Greg? I thought you might be getting a little hungry. Oh, thanks, dear. That looks-- [GULPING] Oh, here come the kids. (SINGING) We're the Outdoorsters! The Outdoorsters! We live in a forest free. Oh, we tell tall tales and we scale tall trees. We're the Outdoorsters family. We're the Outdoorsters, the Outdoorsters. Living out in the wild. [SINGING CONTINUES] GREG (VOICEOVER): In the light of the night, even the animals' thoughts turn to romance. And if you listened real hard, you could even hear their plaintive mating calls. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [ANIMAL CHATTERING] Uh-oh. Oh, no! GREG (VOICEOVER): I knew right away that was no animal. It was another human being, and he needed help-- fast. [BARKING] Squirt. Go get help, boy. Squirt. Squirt? Squirt? No, no, no. I'm a friend. Friend. Friend. Ah! GREG (VOICEOVER): I could see plain as day that this fella had a broken leg, and maybe also, a-- a Wounded Knee. Oh, boy, you're hurt, fella. GREG (VOICEOVER): The only thing to do was to drag him back to camp, where we could get him proper medical attention. You wait here. I go get help. What? What is it? Ah! You're crazy. Ah! [GRUNTING] GREG (VOICEOVER): From his Blue Cross card, we learned his name was Weejun, a proud brave. He wanted to thank us for saving his life. He wanted to teach us about the woods. He wanted to charge us $125 for a three week mini course called Wilderness 101. He showed us the woods, and the wild, dangerous, and unpredictable animals who call it their home. [SHOUTING] GREG (VOICEOVER): He also taught us about how the Indians, the children of the wilderness, entrap their prey. This is just a small token of our thanks. And there's more where that came from. Just remember us on the hill. [SIREN] NARRATOR: This is only a test. Repeat, this is only a test. We interrupt this movie in compliance with the president's new Nuclear Preparedness Act. The following rules have been formulated by a government panel of nuclear experts to give you, the theatergoer, maximum protection in case of an all out nuclear war. Note-- in the event of an actual nuclear blast, the film is likely to seem out of focus for a few minutes. Please, bear with us. Rule number one-- choose an aisle captain. Send him to the basement of this theater, where he will find emergency medical supplies, water, and drums of dehydrated Raisinettes and Jujubes. Two, feel underneath your seat. You will feel sticky pink and green nodules. These nodules should inflate at first detection of lethal radiation. They will form a long lasting sugar filled survival bubble, protecting both you and your family. Three, retain your ticket stub. Four, observe smoking, no smoking sections. If your skin or clothing begins to burn, please, be considerate of others. And finally, five-- do not panic. Remember, a calm and cooperative attitude is your best defense against a 40 million ton killer blast of radioactive explosives. GREG (VOICEOVER): And he showed us the delicate and patient art of Indian fishing-- catching fish with your hands, without the use of rod and reel, or bait. I got one! I got a fish! Whoa! Where's Billy? Look! There he is! Look! Look! GREG (VOICEOVER): Two minds reaching across the centuries, across totally different cultures, trying to share, striving to communicate, against all odds. Wa wa. Winnebago. Gee, I wish we spoke Kaopetate. He knows so much about the woods. There's so much we could learn. What your friend Weejun is trying to say is that in nature, as in life itself, there's a natural bonding process. Science tells us that different animals enjoy each other's company, and the social settings, like the old neighborhood watering hole or a nearby field, are ideal settings for their frolicking. And this inter-species teasing and game playing is just one more example of the harmony we humans can learn from the animal world. But also, there is the other side. There is a strict hierarchy in the wild, and not all creatures are lucky enough to survive the ruthless life and death struggles. Violence flexes its ugly muscles all too often in the wild. Those animals didn't fare too well from that violent encounter. But how about that watch? Well, unbeknownst to the animals, we had this watch strapped to one of their paws. Still ticking. Amazing, isn't it? Those may be ordinary animals, but that's no ordinary watch. The pigeon was blasted, but not the watch. It always survives. In fact, it's been tested around the globe, and many of those tests are exciting. On the fist of a diver off the cliff in Acapulco. On the pontoon of a seaplane landing in the waves. On the tip of a ski in the snow covered mountains to the west. On a clay pigeon blasted by a-- [RADIO CHATTER] GREG (VOICEOVER): We were like tourists in a foreign land-- sightseers, and Weejun was our guide. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] GREG (VOICEOVER): Then there were the birds and the bees. Weejun surprised us. Like Barb and I, he had a mature and open attitude about s-- s-- S-E-X. And we learned that although there were many differences between Weejun's culture and our own, we had similar views about sexuality and, uh, prejudice. Oh, well I love scuba diving. As a matter of fact, I was diving in Bermuda not long ago. Really? Yeah. 50 feet under the water. Me, swimming around, my outfit with the oxygen tank. I ran into a friend of mine, also 50 feet under the water, had no scuba diving equipment on at all. I said, Sam, my god, what are you doing down here 50 feet under the water without scuba diving equipment? He said, schmuck, I'm drowning. GREG (VOICEOVER): Even at night, Weejun took us out into the wild. MAN: Jesus. Oh, hey! Get out of here. Sorry. Excuse me. What's going on up there? It's a stag film. Hey, yo, down in front. Kind of makes you want to do something, huh? Yes, it does. Well? What are you waiting for? You hunk a buck, you. Hey, get out of the way. Get out of the way! GREG (VOICEOVER): And finally, we learn how Weejun's people grew food. Hey, this looks like corn. What do you call it? Maize. Get your souvenirs right here. Willie Mays, right here. Right here. Hey, hey. Keep up the good, little Billy. All right, Willie. Souvenirs, right here. Willie Mays, souvenirs. Not that way. This way. Come on, let's go this way. GREG (VOICEOVER): Weejun had an uncanny sense of direction. Even though little Billy was skeptical, Weejun explained that an Indian has about as much chance of getting lost in the woods as a fish forgetting how to swim. Not that way. This way. Come on, let's go this way. Asshole. [BEEPING] BILLY (OVER LOUDSPEAKER): Lost in the woods? Tired? Hungry? Wandering aimlessly for hours through hostile, uncharted terrain? Well, Little Billy's Survival Corporation is here to help you. How much would you expect to pay for a rescue service? $10? $20? $50? For a limited time only, like until it gets dark, and the meat eaters come out, little Billy offers you rescue at an unbelievably low $0.25. That's right, for one thin quarter you'll be rescued and guided to your doorstep. Lost in the woods? Put your faith in some asshole who couldn't find his way out of a telephone booth? Tired? Hungry? Wandering aimlessly for hours through hostile-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes! Yes! BILL: I can't get those Icecapades tickets you asked for. Wrong line? This is Bill? Hang on, OK, babe? GREG (VOICEOVER): I must admit, Mom and I were real proud of the way our little Billy was adapting to wilderness life. He almost seemed like a new person-- relaxed and more content than we had seen him at any time since gold hit $800 an ounce. MAN (VOICEOVER): Dear Mr. Little Billy, the Environmental Protection Agency regrets to inform you that your request to pave over 125,000 acres of natural forest land has been denied. However, we are anticipating the quick passage of the president's new National Wildlife and Resources Preservation Act, at which time we would be happy to work with you in paving over this area. Until then, I remain sincerely-- whoa! Oh my gosh. Squirt, go get help! Get help! Watch out! You can take him. He can take him! Pin his tail! Pin his tail! Squirt, you brought help! Quit, dog! Quit! Are you crazy, honey? Now, I do floors, and I do laundry. I cleans kitchens, and I do ironing, but I positively draw the line at cougars. I told the agency, I don't do no cougars. Now I need car fare, and who's going to drive me to the bus? Watch out for his teeth! Rip his hair out! Come on, Weej. Get down. NARRATOR: The Legion of Decency and the United Citizens for a Better Tomorrow have determined that continuous exposure to films of this nature may be hazardous to your health. We request you stay in your seats and bear with us. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] NARRATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, Watergate celebrity, Mr. G. Gordon Liddy. You know, the human will is an amazing power. Cities have been built, mountains moved-- the entire course of history has been changed through sheer will. But there are some things that even will is powerless against. For some unfortunate people, all of them in the world can't make them like everyone else. I'd like to talk to you about a disease that can strike anyone, of any age, at any time, any place. This year I've been asked to co-chair the fund-raising drive for the Society for the Prevention of Jerry Lewis. Most of you are probably thinking, Jerry Lewis? I thought they cured that years ago. But the sad truth is Jerry Lewis was never completely wiped out. He's been neglected for years, and the disease is spreading again. Complacency and ignorance are our biggest enemies. In the early stages of JL simplex, the stricken laugh at old Jerry Lewis movies. Soon its victims are spending the entire Labor Day weekend in front of the television, watching the telethon-- helpless, unable to sleep. Too scared they're going to miss the part where Jerry cries. It's not a very pretty thought, is it? Worse, left untreated, the latter stages of JL simplex can become much, much more serious. I didn't mean to drive the whole truck on your foot, because that's why I was going that way. I'll tell ya-- no, I'm not going anywhere. Come on. Jerry. Jerry. Yeah, I'm not Dave. Please, give me my kids. Please. Hey! Frock inspector. [INAUDIBLE] For you, Miss Harvey. Hey, buddy, look-- Most important thing is, Miss Purdy, to like yourself. That's what's most important. Right now there is no known cure for this awful condition. It could strike you-- even your children. We need money for research. We've got to stay ahead of the Russians, so please, when the ushers come down the aisle, please give generously. Give till it hurts. Give before it's too late. We've already lost France. [BELL RINGING] NARRATOR: Old prejudices die hard. Cancer-- say it. It won't bite you. After all, isn't cancer just another way of saying growth? And isn't growth what America is all about? GREG (VOICEOVER): A message in the public interest, funded by the National Tobacco Institute, Asbestos Growers of America, People For PCB, microwave manufacturers, the Diet Soda institute, the Brotherhood of Bacon Curers, the Nondairy Creamer Association, Friends of Red Dye #2, the State of New Jersey Oral Contraceptive League-- [BELL RINGING] Whoa. Oh, yes! Oui! Oui! Hello, Chicago? That's right. I want 5 to 1 on the cougar, and make it a C note. Hiya! Hold all bets. Get him! He's a wimp! He's a wimp! No! No, Squirt! Shh! Squirt, come back! Squirt, come back. Hey, Squirt. Come back. GREG (VOICEOVER): It was a close call, but luckily both little Billy and Weejun had escaped that brush with death. As for the cougar, we were sure he'd learned his lesson, and wouldn't soon mess with us again. Needless to say, the family took brave little Squirt's disappearance very hard. And in the months that followed, we searched fruitlessly for our furry little friend. And after a while, even little Billy gave up. He would never again believe in miracles. We learned that all wounds heal with time. That life must go on, and that if you break it, you bought it. Spring came, and with it new hope. For Bambi, it would be that special spring-- that spring that must happen in every young girl's life. Oh, really? Oh! Oh. Oh, really? 16, 17, 18. God, I've got cramps already. You don't-- you're not a woman. I hope you won't tell anyone. I have my reputation to look after, you know? [KNOCKING] [ANIMAL CRIES] You're supposed to be a classy hotel. Mr. Amsterdam-- I got upstairs, and I called down the clerk, I said, hey, I got a leak in the sink. He says, go right ahead. The customer's always right. Talk-- what about Greg? But I guess everything worked out all right. The family in the-- 40 years we've been married. She laughs at everything I do. I guess that's why we only have two children. GREG (VOICEOVER): Mom had been putting her time to good use. She started to grow organic food every bit as good as the food she used to buy in the city. Hi, Weejun! GREG (VOICEOVER): Weejun's leg had healed pretty good by now, and sadly, the time had come for him to go back to his people. Weejun began to prepare a special ceremonial dinner. It was touching to see how much Weejun meant to the local animals, as they came by to say their goodbyes. Soup's on. Come and get it. You may say grace tonight, Bambi. Thank you for the birds and the trees. Thank you for the honey bees. Thank you for the marshy bogs. Thank you for soft, hollow logs. Thanks for furry hugs so tight. Thanks for grizzly claws at night. Thanks for giving me the luck-- I finally found a bear to-- Uh, that's fine, Bambi. Fine. Uh, Weejun has asked us to join him in a toast tonight of his, uh, tribe's ritual potion. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We are here to pay tribute tonight to a truly remarkable, unwashed red man we like to call Weejun. [APPLAUSE] Hey, Weejun, buddy. Glad you could make it. I'd like now the opportunity to turn the dais over to another wonderful, wonderful man. A man who's a lover of wild things in his own right. A man who needs no introduction, Mr. Myron Cohen! [APPLAUSE] Thank you very much. You're very kind. It's great to play the mountains again, but tonight we're here to honor Weejun. Hey, Weejun. How are ya? Or should I say, how? Hey, you ever sit down and talk to this guy? He's the original sitting bull. But I want to tell ya, Weejun, we've got a fantastic surprise for you. Believe me, there are a group of your wonderful friends who come out of the woods just once a year to entertain you and your guests. I want you to meet them, the first Americans. (SINGING) A story I remember about a little Indian boy who had a bow and arrow as his only toy. He was as strong as a beaver-- Get down, Weej. Wait, Weej. (SINGING) But that was long ago. Long ago. Long ago. Weejun? He's calling himself Weejun now? His name is Eugene. He thinks he's a savage? I know, I grew up with him. The kid's a sissy. The most savage thing he ever did was he ordered red wine with fish. We got this cigar store in the Bronx, you know? Family business. And, uh, Eugene starts going Indian on me. He starts taking, uh, beads and trinkets, and stuff. Suddenly money's not good enough anymore. So I get this idea. I say, uh, listen, go out, pose in front of the store. You know, maybe it's good for business. He says no. He doesn't even say no. He grunts. Suddenly we're not talking the same language. For GREG (VOICEOVER): Rising before the rest of us, Weejun began his solitary preparation of his tribe's ancient ritual of departure. Coney Island. Jane. [SHOUTING] [CHANTING] Come on, you want spraypaint all over you? Hey Weej, so long. Come on, smile, or else I'll take a spraypaint can to ya. Smile. [CHANTING "HOW YA DOING?"] [CHANTING "DALAI LAMA"] [CHANTING] [CHANTING "STOP ALREADY"] Oh, yeah. There's one thing I forgot to tell ya. The cougar's back, and he's pissed! It was the easiest thing for the family to lay all their problems on Cougie. I mean, the cougar. To tell you the truth, before I started dating Cougie, I'd heard all the stories, too. But Cougie ain't like that. He's a real gentleman. Knows how to treat a lady. Anyway, this Indian, Weejun, jumps out of nowhere and attacks Cougie with a knife. Cougie was asleep at the time. Well, maybe he was pacing. But he wasn't stalking. No way. Cougie told me himself, he wasn't stalking. Look, he may be a carnivore [INAUDIBLE], but he ain't no liar. Cougie, if you're watching, maybe you could find room in that big heart of yours to forgive me? I love you, Cougie. And I guess I always will. And Cougie? I'm really sorry I wore the fur coat that night. Please take me back. [BLOWING] [PHONE RINGING] Hoo. Hoo? [BEEP] [BLEATING] [SHOUTING] The following is a public service announcement. Hi, my name is Stanley Seagal O'Matthew. Little Timmy Lee, you know, he's never had the advantages your son has had. He's never heard an oncoming express subway train. He's never had a slice of day old, reheated pizza. But for boys like Timmy, and you know there are literally thousands of them, we can change all of that. We can send this boy to the city for the summer, and give him a chance to play with open fire hydrants. Give him a chance to play those real loud, horrible radios late at night. There's a way to help. Thanks very much, Luke. Send your money to the Open Hydrant Fund. For little Timmy's sake. I ain't never seen a transvestite. GREG (VOICEOVER): I hate to admit it, but I was beginning to sense trouble in paradise. The hardship of wilderness living had apparently begun to take its toll on my family. And what with the disappearance of Squirt, and Weejun's leaving-- well, the wife and kids just didn't seem to be having as much fun anymore. I, of course, knew better. This was just a phase they were going through-- a bad storm to be weathered. A bone in an otherwise perfect turkey dinner. MOM (VOICEOVER): What? Are you crazy? What are you talking about? This hasn't been any fun from the beginning. We just did it for you. BAMBI (VOICEOVER): Wise up, Dad. Except for the bear, this woods shit is a drag. BILLY (VOICEOVER): Whose kids are you trying to kid, Dad? You're just trying to supplement cause you can't get it on with Mom. GREG (VOICEOVER): Now wait a minute, son. That's no way to speak to your father. Well, I just think you haven't given it enough time. EVERYONE (VOICEOVER): We've been here two years, and we hate it! GREG (VOICEOVER): Well, search your hearts and give me one honest reason for not trying it a bit longer. BILLY (VOICEOVER): What about the, uh, killer cougar? GREG (VOICEOVER): Don't be ridiculous. That cougar's been taught a lesson already. He wouldn't attack us. Why should he want to attack us now? Look, don't worry about the cougar. Forget the cougar. No one worry about the cougar. Now, I'm still the father around here, and I'm just asking you, please, bear with me. [EVERYONE OOH-ING] GREG (VOICEOVER): Very funny. [CRASHING] [DOORBELL] What was that? I don't know. [FARTING NOISE] Probably just the wind. [FARTING NOISE] I don't know what it is. But let's all pray it's been eating correctly. Do you think it'll come back? [CRASHING] It must be the cougar. Quick, we don't have a second to lose. Bambi, grab a wet towel, put on your gloves, and get under that bed. Billy, grab that door, guard that broom, and make it snappy. Barb, I want that tit in this hand, and fast. Now move it. I've got an idea. Let's throw out little Billy. That'll appease it. Get lost, ya puke. I bet it's that dumb bear of yours coming back for sloppy seconds. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Now, now, kids, we haven't got time. Yeah? Yeah. Oh, yeah! We've all got to pull together. The cougar! The cougar! The cougar! It's not the cougar. Who else would have a motive? Who else would have a motive? It's our little Squirt! Don't shoot! You can't kill him! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! But he's not the same dog anymore. He's been in the woods too long. He's as wild as that cougar now. He's crazed, he's raving. He's totally out of control. Shoot him! Shoot him! Waste him! Waste the sucker! Splatter his brains all over that porch! GREG (VOICEOVER): We were lucky to have survived that night. We owed our lives to that tranquilizer gun, and to the tranquilizer darts I had brought from the city. Hey, Squirt. It's good to see you feeling like your old self again. What do you want, old boy? Ah. I'll bet you I know. I'll get you a treat. Here you go, boy. I give up, Squirt. What do you want? GREG (VOICEOVER): It was easy to see what little Squirt wanted. And I had more than enough tranquilizer darts to keep him high for years. As I prepared to give Squirt his dose, I couldn't help but think of the awesome power of the gun, and those tranq darts. Just the knowledge that such a weapon could totally immobilize a wild dog, or kill a cougar, or a full breasted American female, made my blood run hot. One well-placed dart would leave her defenseless, helpless, unable to resist. It gave me new hope, and there wasn't a court in the country that would prosecute a husband for trying to get away with-- Greg, I've got wonderful news for you. We've been talking it over, and we've changed our mind. We've decided we like the wilderness. And we want to settle here for good. Oh, no. What's wrong, Dad? Greg, what's the matter? Greg? Get inside. Start packing. We can't live here anymore. We're going back where we came from. Right now. -Why? What's wrong? Greg, what do you mean? Greg? Look. [CITY SOUNDS] Are you sure it's absolutely new? No. It does have a nice view, dear. Are they going to put in a bathroom? A bathroom? What's that? Oh, throw a bathroom in. [INAUDIBLE] All tile. Beautiful. Oh, and speaking of my wife-- No, don't speak of your wife. You know, a lot of guys kid about their wives. Not me. I've got my wife who's a doll. Hey, Mr. Am-- Little effeminate, but such a nice girl. -We're here to talk about Greg-- -Little things, like-- Hey, Amsterdam, listen! The morning after we got married, she said, sweetheart, I got a confession to make. Just keep-- Yeah, get his agent on the phone. The guy's a wash up. Let's get out of this place, and fast. Wait up. Come on, Barb. Move it. Come on, Ma! We'd like our car. Which car is that? The Brown '80 Impala Wagon. Have you got the ticket? Ticket? I don't have the ticket. I gave it to you. To me? You never gave me any ticket. Hey, look, we don't have a ticket. Hey, don't you remember us? No. I am sorry. No ticket, no car. Well, what do we do now? RADIO: And coming this fall, it's Greg, Barb, Bambi, Squirt, and little Billy van Waspishes in Forever Outdoorsters, The Saga Continues. Like hell it is! RADIO: And all their friends on exciting new adventures. You didn't sign a sequel deal, did you? RADIO: See them overcome every obstacle. Are you kidding? Did you read that script? My agent laughed in their faces. We haven't even gotten the meeting yet. Besides, I just got a continuing gig on a soap for real. RADIO: And there's more! See Barb and Greg make whoopie under the stars as-- I can't do this. I'm booked to do Nora and the Dollhouse in two weeks at the Melville Dinner Theatre.
