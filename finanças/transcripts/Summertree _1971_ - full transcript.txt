That roommate of yours finally make a pass at you? What are you talking about? You mean Bennie? Uh, Bennie. Yeah, Bennie. The faggoty one, you know. (CHUCKLES) Bennie's all right. All right? Yeah.

JERRY: Hey, I'm glad to see you get a lot of work done. Oh, you mean this. This is the week I was supposed to be in Hawaii. Hawaii? Yeah, a trip I won at the office. But those leis and crap, though, I took the money instead. And the time. Hey, where's Mom? Well, she's... Now don't tell me you came home to see us? Why not? Come on. Come on, now, what's up? Nothing. Let's have a beer. You wanna cigarette? No, thanks. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) You smoking anything stronger? Sometimes. Nothing special. You got a girl?

What I mean is, I... Well, I guess I just don't like to see your mother upset. RUTH: Herb. Jerry! Is anything wrong? No. Can't a guy come home and see his folks when he gets the urge? Oh, baby. Everything's okay, Mom. Um, what have you got here? Oh, just some bulbs. I'm planting for spring, before the ground gets hard. Can you stay for the weekend? He's got classes... I haven't decided yet. Oh, Herb, I told you not to put those things in the sink. Now, Ruthie, I got to dress them before I can freeze them. All right? I asked you to keep them outside. (SIGHING) You hear that? You'd better be good. (LAUGHS) I knew it was a mistake. Majoring in sociology. I didn't say it was a mistake, Dad. You're doing better in physics. May not have anything to do with his major, Herb. Mom, I don't even know if it has anything to do with school. May just be me, I don't know. You studying too hard? (LAUGHS) I hardly study at all. HERB: I'd like to see how you'd do if you really study. Yeah, I bet you would. Why not? I like to see people function. I like to see you use yourself. Be what you're cut out to be. And not for me. Now don't get that idea. I don't need you to make me a big man. JERRY: What am I cut out to be? HERB: Well, that's what you're in school, to find out. JERRY: Well, I haven't. Well, you will. Boy, I sure wish I had your optimism. Well, now, isn't that why you came home? I don't know. I... I guess because, yeah, everything always seems so simple here. Life among the simpleminded, huh? Hey, fast, huh? Jer, there's nothing wrong with not knowing yet. Mom, but it's not "not knowing," it's like not feeling. I can't get excited about anything. Look, like Dad, he gets excited when he... When he does his insurance tables or when he watches the Packers game. Well, he doesn't expect you to be like him. He... He just doesn't like to see you unhappy. You know that, don't you?

(PROFESSOR SPEAKING ON TV) Introjected into this theory vent. Really, in a sense we are, uh, waste baskets into which the ideas that are mirrored to us in our early life were deposited. And with consequences that again by the time... Hi, Bennie. ...you're the age of anyone listening to my voice, uh, this theory then is stocked full of all kinds of theories. There's one way to kind of dramatize this is to ask you how many of these stripes are red and how many of them are white? Now normally in, uh, in an audience people will say that six or seven are red. How many are you thinking are red? You want to know what I was thinking? Yep. Do you really want to know what I was thinking? I really want to know what you were thinking. Okay. I was thinking of small bodies. What? Small bodies? Yes. I was thinking of the small bodies present in micro-organisms producing diphtheria, whether they're sulfur or metachromatic granules. Right. I got an exam Monday. I thought you'd finished with school. Well, one school. But, uh, that's just enough to change bandages and boil needles. But I figure if I go two more years I can go for my State License. Then you can deliver babies. You know I did that once. Oh. Oh, I did. What are you grinning at? You. Your head, it's so beautiful it really scares me. You're pretty creepy yourself. No, no, I mean... I mean, well, you're doing things, you know. Doesn't everybody do something? I don't know. You want to know what I'm doing right now? Yeah. I'm sitting here uptight, you know, hoping you'll like me, right? And you're thinking about microorganisms. Oh, Jerry, I'm sorry. Oh, no, no, no. It's not like that. It's just, uh, well, you deliver babies. One. Yeah, but... And here I'm afraid to say, uh, yes or no, four-letter words, something. Well, they're the best kind. Oh, I know. Sure. (MOUTHING WORDS) I think I'm losing my train of thought. That's okay. I'm not going anywhere. Say that again. Very slowly. I said, I'm not going anywhere. Wow! Am I crazy or are people staring at us? Hey, I know a good place we can go. Oh, never mind, another graveyard? No, no. No, no, it's my turn. It's my turn. I know a great place. Okay? Okay. You live pretty good for a nurse. Thank you. Oops. That's not too good. Nope. Nope. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh. (MOANS) Aha! What? (HUMMING) (VANETTA LAUGHS) VANETTA: Jerry. JERRY: Yeah? Jerry, what are you doing? JERRY: Trying to get your buttons undone. (VANETTA GIGGLING) What's the story with your buttons? Jerry. Yeah? The zipper is in the back, dum-dum. You mean they're all phony buttons in the front? (MOANING) You know something? What? Your best routine is yourself. Hey, when do I get my song? What song? Don't I get a song? What, you mean something that rhymes? Yeah. You want your name in it? Yes. Aha! Kind of hard to do a song in the dorsal recumbent position. The dorsal position becometh to me. Oh.

JERRY: I never thought of that. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. (DOOR OPENS) Hey, kiddo! Dad, how are you? Oh, Jerry! Merry Christmas. HERB: Merry Christmas. Hey, you look like Santa Claus. I feel like him. Come on inside. RUTH: Oh, yes, come on. (HERB LAUGHING HEARTILY) (CHATTERING ON TV) RUTH: The Torgesons might come over later. I can do without Tim. He quit paying on his policy. Herb, he's an old friend. Just when he needs it more than ever, refinancing the house, Ginny in college. RUTH: She came home the day before yesterday. Oh, yeah, where's she going to school? RUTH: Northwestern. She's a freshman. He thinks the market's a better place for his money. The way the war and interest rates are knocking the hell out of the market, he'll be lucky if he gets... Goddamn, son of a bitch! I did it again. Dad, you don't have to pitch us. Do you remember her 16th birthday? Yeah, geez, wasn't that a bash with that whole orchestra there and everything? RUTH: No, I meant the crush she had on you. Yeah. Nothing worse, you're 16 and a fat girl with pimples got a crush on you. Jerry! She's a beautiful girl. Well, it's true. Hey, I saw her at Hefferman's the other day, a new Cougar, dark glasses. No more pimples either, buddy. What're you trying to do, set me up? Set you up? Set you up for what? Ginny Torgeson. Can't you see he's not interested, Herb? He'd be lucky to get five minutes with her. He's got a girl. Hey, what's this? You holding out on me? I found some pictures when I was putting your things away. And you weren't going to tell us? Well, I guess I'm telling you. (LAUGHS) (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) HERB: Vanetta. Vanetta what? Spezia. Very exotic. HERB: Where's she from? JERRY: Pittsburg. She looks, uh... She looks older. JERRY: Older than what? Older than you, dummy. JERRY: Yeah, well, could be she's 43. She's got seven kids. HERB: What class is she in? She's a nurse, Dad. She went to nursing school. Uh, I like her face. It's a generous face. A nurse? Don't worry, Dad. I haven't done anything rash. Who said I got anything against nurses? (SINGING CAROLS) I thought just a stew would be all right, with everybody in tomorrow for dinner mid-day. Well, it's good. Excellent, excellent. (SIGHS) Well, I hope your extra-curricular activities have renewed your interest in school. Well, what was bothering me last month was I didn't have anything I could get into. Well, you were bombed. We know that, Jerry. I guess I didn't make much sense. Listen, I know there's a generation gap, and everyone's having an identity crisis, and everything is groovy, but we're not as square as you think, you know. I just hope that your girlfriend and your social work have helped you in other ways. You mean, as an indicator of my state of mind? Yeah. Yeah, if that's... If you want to put it that way. Well, there is something I am cut out for. What is it? My guitar. Now I know this sounds mundane as all hell, but, uh, I had college in mind. I know you did, Dad, and I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Oh, you're sorry? Look, please, look. I know what they're talking about at school, right? I mean, I understand the concepts and all that stuff. I know all about those things. But that's all they are, they're things, they're theories. They've got no personal relevance to me at all. Now maybe they will next week, next month, next year. I don't know, but what the hell's that got to do with what's making me happy right now? You know, I wish I could take you half as seriously as you sound. (CAROLS PLAYING ON STEREO) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (FOOTSTEPS) I knew I'd find you out here. I didn't mean to run out on everybody. They're just going. You must be freezing to death. Just wanted to get some fresh air. You mean nobody can get to you up there. I like eggnogs and all that stuff. But listening to Dad pitching his friends term policies on Christmas Eve... Jerry, I... (PEOPLE LAUGHING) I want you to know he's doing a lot of thinking. It's like talking to a wall. He wants to hear you play your guitar. (BELLS RINGING) Merry Christmas, Jerry. Merry Christmas. (GUNSHOTS FIRING) (SQUAWKING) I'd like to see the look on your mother's face when she sees that one in the sink, huh? All right, Cyrus, go get him, boy. HERB: Okay, so I heard you play and you're good. But how's that going to keep you out of the Army? I transfer to the conservatory. The what? It's a music school, it's right on campus. Oh, the draft board's going to love that. As long as I carry 15 hours a semester there's no sweat. (GUN LOADS) (GUN FIRING) Uh, let them too much. (LAUGHS) Did you tell that to your mother? (EXHALES) Yeah. What'd she say? She said, "What'd your father say?" Goddamn war. Whoo-hoo. Three years ago you were hawking it up, Dad. What are you talking about? You've still got part of that, uh, bumper sticker left on your car. Well, things change. Well, like now I'm 20 and my birthday falls on the wrong day, right? Right. Sorry about that. (BLOWS SHRILLY) Hey, it works. (QUACKING SOUNDS) Dad. Spring semester's in four weeks. I made the check out to you this time. Thank you. Not a Christmas present, you know. For your education. So I damn well better get one, right? Boy, you don't give an inch, do you? You're as stubborn as a... As you think I am. The difference is you think that life consists of absolutes. You can only do this, you can only do that. Now why can't you go to school and play that guitar at the same time? Because it's a copout, Dad. It's a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I know what I want. Want? That's bullshit. You know, you didn't hit a shot all day. Guess I lost my eye. A couple of years ago you would have had me out here before the birds woke up. Couldn't wait to get out here. Look, if you don't like to hunt anymore, all you have to do is say so. A simple declarative sentence. Make me feel like a horse's ass. Hey, Dad, would you mind if I went back to school early? And break your mother's heart? That's funny. That's exactly what she said about you. VANETTA: I'll try to get back early. In case you get back before I do... (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) JERRY: I don't understand a word but it sounds sexy as all hell. VANETTA: It means "open all hours." (MARVIS STRUMMING GUITAR) (PEOPLE CHEERING) (NOISEMAKER BLOWING) (TV CLICKS OFF) MAN ON TV: ...a merciful or an all-powerful God would permit these mass murders. (WOMAN SHRIEKING) MAN: A clambake, friends and a good cigarette would do it. (SOFTLY) Jerry? Oh, yeah. JERRY: Hi. Hey, who is this bum in my bed? Um, I'm the milkman. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, a horny milkman. Oh, Jesus! (WHISPERS) Hey, what is this? Some sort of commune? Jerry, he looks so cute. Hey, uh... Hey, where were you at midnight? On a bus, somewhere in, uh, Indiana, on my way back here. Happy New Year. Who's Tony? Well, are those his shoes and stuff in the closet? What are you doing, going through my closet? No, I went and left my boots there and I found them. He's my husband. He was my husband. We've been separated for two years. (SIGHS) Then he's, uh... He's still your husband. Yes, legally. What's the matter? Have you got some sort of a moral hang-up? Why didn't you tell me? Well, (SIGHS) I'm telling you now. We've been separated for two years. I can't even stand the stupid son-of-a-bitch. Oh, Jerry. It's okay. You don't... You don't have to say any more. Oh, I want to. It's okay, Vanetta. I want to. It's all right, baby. I married him out of high school, I didn't even think. Hey, hey, hey. It's all right. It's okay. I just want to tell you that you got yourself a new roommate. (WHISPERS) Does that include Marvis? (WHISPERS) No, it's just you and me. Oh. (WHISPERS) Terrific. (GIRL AUDITIONING) (PERFORMING OPERA) Thank you. MAN: Gerald McAdams. Uh, the first piece that I'm going to do is something I wrote. Give you an idea of the music that I'm doing right now. Doesn't have a title yet. (GUITAR PLAYS SOFTLY) (GROANING) Thank you. You played very nicely. With whom did you study? Um... Well, I sort of taught myself. To read as well? Yes, sort of. Any other instruments? Um, well, yeah, I play the piano pretty well. You know, by ear. I see. Thank you. We'll be contacting you in about a week's time. MAN: Nancy Rifkind? You really got that thing under your fingers, haven't you? Oh, thanks. Pretty tight in there, though. Oh, yeah.

Well, I own a coffee shop on Lexington called the Grass Roots. Now, I'm looking for somebody to play intermissions and maybe sit in with my regular band. Now they lost their bass player to the draft. Now, all these kids who work for me come from the conservatory here because I can't afford to pay union scale. Are you offering me a job? Shh. Are you... Are you offering me a job? Sixty a week, five nights, meals, and no weed. I don't want to get busted. Oh, man! Miss Spezia? Yes. Herb McAdams. Oh, hello. Oh, well, won't you come in, please? Thank you. Uh, Jerry. Hey, Dad, Jesus, what a surprise. How are you? All right. Well, greetings. And it was nice of you to let me know you moved. I've been hiking all over the campus looking for you. That ex-roommate of yours, Bennie, he kindly informed me I was looking in the wrong place. Dad, did you meet Vanetta? Yeah. I hope you don't mind, I opened that. You've been reclassified 1-A. Your physical's next week. Excuse me. No, I think maybe you ought to stay and hear this, young lady. On account of how much you mean to him. Why don't you sit down? So... So you went and dropped out, huh? This is a hell of a way for me to find out, isn't it? I gave you $1,500. What's the matter? You can't afford a 70-cent phone call? Dad. Excuse me. It's all there, except for 50 bucks. I was going to tell you that along with some good news. HERB: Good news? Mmm-hmm. I'm transferring to that conservatory full-time. I auditioned last week. Excuse me. So, you see, when I get in, I'll get my deferment back. When you get in? You mean you haven't gotten in yet? Oh, I'll hear... I'll hear this week. Well, supposing you don't? Have you considered that? Well, I never played better in my whole life. That not answering my question! I'll answer it this week. So that's what this was for, huh? Music lesson. It was, yeah. But, uh... I'm going to do it on my own now. I got myself a job. What's wrong with my money? Uh, you mean the, uh, blank check I bribed you into? Now, don't get noble with me. Don't you pay for goods you don't want. That was my bag, remember? Your, bag. Yeah, a bag of bullshit is what it is. Excuse me. Coffee? Thanks, V. You're gonna crapshoot, huh? Boy, you are a horse's ass. Maybe. But it's my ass, Dad. No matter what happens, I'm not going in. Well, that may not be your decision. That's exactly what it is. Sure. You decide between the Army or jail. Now, I don't think it's that serious, Mr. McAdams. I'm sure he'll be going to the conservatory. Well, I hope you're right, young lady. I sure hope you're right. Thank you for the coffee. Oh, you're welcome. Uh, here. Go puncture your eardrum or something. Hey, Dad. Dad. Hey, Dad, please, will you wait a minute, please? Dad, there's something I want to tell you. Oh, don't worry, Mr. McAdams, I'm not pregnant. You see, I've never been happier in my whole life. I'm doing what I want and I'm good at it, and I'm helping this kid discover himself, (JERRY SIGHS) and I'm getting into my guitar, and I found Vanetta. I this, I that. I, I, I. We didn't say that, McAdams. We think you're a very talented young man. What more do you want? The conservatory simply cannot admit you as a sophomore without some formal training. Without some knowledge of the musical literature. Oh, okay, you start me as a freshman, right? On an accelerated program, I can finish the whole thing in two and a half years. Twenty-four credit hours a semester. I'll do it. I promise. I can really do it. We can't give your draft board any assurance you can carry such a load. No one ever has. There aren't enough hours in the day. So you're doing the old numbers game, aren't you? 128 units in four years or that's it, boot camp, man, sorry about that. That game, son, was not our invention. I only wish you'd started with the conservatory. Guess I'm kind of what you call a late bloomer. McAdams. Please, let me urge you. Whatever you decide, don't abandon music. You have an obligation to such a talent. (SOBBING) That... That's groovy. (GUITAR STRUMMING) It's very hot. Enjoy. VANETTA: Thank you. BENNIE: What do you want? Coke. DON: What do you want? VANETTA: White wine. White wine? White wine she'll have and I'll have a beer. I'll have a Coke, please. Hey, man! Hi. Hi. We figured out some new angles. Yes. First of all, have you checked to see how far down you are on your local list? You may not get picked... Fifth out of 365. How about get married, have a baby? Hey, man, I told you about that. Remember, they passed that law? Oh yeah, I remember, no longer can you do that. Anyway, I'm not even divorced. Zap. Why don't you flunk your physical, huh? That's it. You have anything wrong with you? A bad back or a trick knee, uh, flat feet? Asthma, syphilis. Terrible headaches? Syphilis? There's nothing wrong with him. I gave him a complete examination. He's in goddamn perfect health. What about a shrink? Did you ever go to a shrink? No. You get a letter, you get right out. What? Yeah. Pre-psychotic, suicidal tendencies. Then you go to the draft board, you act crazy. You jump around a lot. Come on. I'm not kidding. I know a guy who's puked on a psychiatrist. I'm not kidding, I'm serious. Hey, man, play gay, you know, tell them you're a queer. Right. Yeah. You know, when they tell you to cough down, get all excited. Right. Tell them, "Just let me at those juicy recruits." That's no good. That's no good, you know why? They got a new thing now, in Texas. A platoon just for faggots. I'm serious, I swear. (ALL LAUGHING) No, they bring the faggots, they put them in trenches, they grab the V... They don't kill them, they just grab them into the trenches and do strange things, I don't know. Seriously, go C.O. JERRY: Well, you got to have a whole long history, a record... BENNIE: Do you want to kill? Right. I think I'll go to Canada. Hey, let's get back to this, uh, C.O. thing then, huh? Uh, how do you feel about the war? Well, it sucks. Yes, but they're not interested in moral reasons. You see, they're only interested in old time religion. That's all they care about. (WHISPERS) Right. You know something, man, I think you want to go and you don't even know it. Look, I'm not going. I mean, that's all there is to it. I'm not going. Right. REPORTER ON TV: Communist troops continued maneuvers that threaten to cut off a large Cambodian taskforce north of Phnom Penh. An official said bands of guerrillas have placed themselves behind government units and have blown up two bridges between the units and Skua, the district headquarters. The U.S. command announced the loss of the first American fighter bomber in missions over Cambodia in more than two months. Hey, leave it on. Vice President Ky of South Vietnam... For Christ's sakes, Jerry. You're getting morbid. Why do you have to see yourself to do that? You got to see yourself brush your teeth. Why can't you just use a tooth brush like everybody else? You got any more complaints? Yeah. What? You know when you get up in the middle of the night to use the john? Yeah, I know. Could you put the seat back down? Just like that. Anything else? (ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH WHIRRING) Yes. You've got lousy aim. Oh, Jerry, stop it. You're getting me all wet. That's one of the reasons I want you to use a tooth brush. Vanetta Spezia. Yeah? I am scared. (SIGHS) I am, too, Jerry. I feel like I've got one thing on my head. That guy Simpson, you know, he's all I've got left. Would you come to Canada with me? What? Well, what are we going to do up there? We'll be together. Yeah? And, uh... Well, you could get a job in a hospital (CLEARS THROAT) I could get a job, you know, or enter one of the music schools in Montreal or Toronto. You're serious, aren't you? Yeah. Do you think we've had enough time? I guess not, otherwise you wouldn't have to ask that question. (WOMAN SOBBING) Hey, Louis, what happened? She just lost her oldest boy Ray in Vietnam. Ray? Yes. Where's Marvis? He ran out. Thanks, Louis. (BELL RINGS) MARVIS: Get in there, you mother! Get in! Get in there, you! Hi. What do you want with me, Whitey? Well, screw you, Big Brother! It's all right, Marvis. It's okay. It's all right. Hey, Marvis. Marvis. Marvis! Bennie gave me your name. And, I just got my notice, and is there anything you can do to help me? Sure, we can keep most guys off, if they come to see us before they get their notices. But once you've gotten the notice... Well, is there anything we can do? Not unless you're in school or you have some medical problem. How's your health? Perfect. I just had a physical. We could file a C.O. claim. Keep you out for a couple of weeks. The draft board isn't going to listen to you after you've gotten that induction notice. Well, what'd happen if I fought it? If I took it to court? Judges in this town are appointed by the same men that got us into that mess in Vietnam. You'd get five years in the Federal Penitentiary. Okay, well, thank you. You could file a C.O. claim from inside. Well, how do you mean, "inside"? Inside a uniform. (DOOR LEVER RATTLING) (KNOCK AT DOOR) Yeah? MAN: I'm looking for Vanetta Spezia. I'm her husband. Come on in. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Where is she? She's at work. Looks like I got here just in time. Not that I blame her. We broke up once before. That's what she said. Oh, she did, huh? Yep. Did she also tell you that she promised to wait till I got back? Wait for what? Till I got back. No, she didn't tell me that. Do you go to college here? I used to. I just dropped out. You dropped out. You'd better drop back in if you know what's good for you. It's bad enough over there, the shit. Wait till you get back. That's the best part. Jerry. Oh! (CHUCKLES) Hi, baby. Hello, Tony. Jerry... Hey, it's... It's cool, okay. Nice to meet you. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Anybody home? Yes. (JERRY SIGHS) Hi. He gone? Oh, yes, he's gone. He wants me back. I want you to come with me. I know. I want to, but... Is it him? Partly. I want you. I really, really want you. What do you want? Time. I just want some more time. I'm so confused, Jerry. (SIGHS LOUDLY) What am I kidding myself for, you know? I mean, uh... Why would you want to come, come walking around the Yukon, you know, with some crazy minstrel guy, and playing his guitar all the time. (SNIFFLES) I don't blame you. What are you going to do now? I'm going to get a divorce, and then I'm going to wait for you. Like you did for Tony? (WHISPERS) Oh, Jerry, please believe me. Please. Please believe me, honey. You have to believe me. Believe me. (DOG BARKING) HERB: Who's out there? It's me, Dad, hi. RUTH: Jerry? Yeah, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Jesus! Nice of you to come by at 5:30 in the morning. Yeah, well, I wasn't really planning on stopping by. Got kind of late. Well, I guess we have to take you when we can get you these days, huh? JERRY: I almost didn't... Didn't what? RUTH: Herb, listen. I'm on my way to Canada. Oh, Jesus Christ. RUTH: Is she with you? Come inside. Both of you. What happened? I didn't get into the School of Music. Got caught in the draft. When are you supposed to report? JERRY: Today. Well, you had plenty of rope, now don't say that we... Oh, Dad, come on, please. You know, I'm not blaming you. All I want to come to say was goodbye. I'm sorry. I'm going to put on some coffee. You'd actually give up your citizenship? If I have to, yeah. Jesus Christ! Herb, my father came to this country 50 years ago to avoid the draft in Poland. That's not the same thing. It's exactly the same thing! Well, you'd better get that thing checked out. (WHISPERS) It's okay. (WHISPERS) It's all right. HERB: I don't know what else it needs, but it could sure use some tires. What do you get for that set of 740s? MAN: Well, it'd run you about, uh, $128 plus tax, Herb. Hey, Dad, the rear tires are okay. I'm getting you the whole set. Plus a spare. That's more than the goddamn thing is worth. Hey, Joe, put a set of 740s and a spare on that bomb. Hey, you know, these damn pigs are worn right down to the casings. You're lucky you made it this far. Hey, you got any maps here? Yeah, I think there's some in that little office right behind you there. Oh, thank you. HERB: Look, I know this sounds strange, but I haven't got time to explain. I want that car laid up for a couple of days. Look, crack the block, put something in the fuel line, anything. You know more about that than I do. Here. Well, Herb, why... Look, don't question me, will you? Just don't question me. I'll explain to you later. Believe me, it has to be done. MAN: Herb, don't... Just do as I ask, will you? (SOBBING) Hey, wait a minute, I still got a couple of bolts... Hey, wait a minute! Where you going? HERB: Jerry, stop! (SOBBING) Oh, Jesus Christ, Jerry! RUTH: Herb! Any mail today? He'll write again as soon as he can. You know how they are. Ah, it's too close to the house. One good storm and... I bet it's been there 80 years. It hasn't fallen yet. Well, you know what I mean. Ever since I built that damn tree house, he'd scamper up there like a squirrel whenever he... To be by himself. Boy's entitled to that. Oh, kids. Boy, you think they're yours and they're not, not really. The worst part of it is they keep reminding you of it. Well, we weren't any different. Come on, let's go in, huh? (HERB SIGHS) I should have torn it down years ago. MAN OVER RADIO: ...station now presents the news. Local, national and around the world. With John Mitchm reporting from Washington, David Allen in New York, Robert Andrews from Saigon, Mark Robin reporting from Paris, Harold Joseph... (LOWERS VOLUME) You know something, Ruth? Mmm? I bet I know what he's going to say when he comes home. "You overstated your case, Dad, you always do. "Get so excited making a deal or watching a ball game. "Goddamn, what a mistake I almost made, huh?" (RUTH MOANS SOFTLY) (GUNSHOTS)
