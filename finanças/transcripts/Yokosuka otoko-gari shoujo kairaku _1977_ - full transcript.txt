Would you like to help? - No! Why? Because your mother acts too feminine at the bar. That's the reason why you refuse? I don't want to look like I'm part of her generation. Maybe you're right. Of course I am. You've already been tamed by her kindness. But Miko... Do not think I talk like that because I don't have a mother? - No, I don't think that way. - Because that doesn't feel right to me. What time is it? It's only 10:30. What's the problem? Why don't you stay the night? Just stay the night. Anyway I am calling my sister-in-law Let me borrow your phone. Sure. Don't pick up. I'll kill you if you do. - Must be my sister-in-law - Don't pick up. Let it go. Shit... How much money do you have? - About 100,000.. - Good. Do it later. - Lie down over there. - Stop! I'll kill you if you do something suspicious. I'll give all the money we have. Of course, you will. No! No! It's weird. They must be awake at this time. Anyway I go home tonight. I have some homework to do. OK, then. Be careful. It's quite dark. - Do you need my bike? - No, I can't ride a bike. That's a strange thing to say considering you have no problem driving a car. Let me borrow this. Listen, your wife had fun. You saw it, right? That's why this wasn't rape but making love. Where is the money? I don't care if it's just a little. I'm home. You're home? I called you several times! - Welcome home. - Somebody visited? Looks like they left just now. Did something happen? You had a fight again? - Doesn't matter. Just go to bed. - Alright. You coward! How can you say that? You had fun with that animal. - I have to call. - You can't do that! Like he said, you were just making love. What are you going to say to the police and the company? Shit! It's all over. Honey, I am sorry. Good morning! Did something happen last night? I thought you guys argued until late. It's none of your business. My mother seems to have a new boyfriend. I think he's a member of the municipal parliament. I see. Her ex was an artist. He was great. How come? He was into super-realism. He drew photos with a pencil. He didn't do well. My mother broke up with him because he was too poor. Isn't that your brother? - That's weird. - What about his job? - Maybe he's waiting for someone. - No way! Would you like to find out about his affair? It doesn't look like he's waiting for someone. Come to think of it, my sister-in-law and my brother have been acting weird recently. Hardcore Fucking That's weird. - I am shocked. - What are you going to do? Wait until he come out and confront him? No way! Butt I don't feel like going home either. Then how about going to the place of my mother's ex? Hello. - Hey. - This is my friend, Kiko. - She says she wants to see your work. - Come in. It looks more detailed than a real photo. What an artist! A completely new style. You can draw anything like this? Sure. There's nothing I can't draw. It must be too much stimulation for you guys. So what do guys do with these drawings? Well... Do you draw according to the orders you receive? Of course. This is business. You feel disgusted, sweetheart? To me. drawing a portrait of the Emperor... is not that different from drawing female pubic hair. Hey, Miki? I brought a customer. He wants it by tomorrow Do you know this guy? He is the foreigner who often comes by our bar. Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter? lam going home. - Dance with us! - I am good. See ya! Brother! Quite late today. I had a social meeting with customers. - You must be tired. - Kiko, you are late too for a high-schooler. I watched a movie... A porno. - Where?! - I was kidding. Really. I am home. You went out with your friends? Be careful. It's not good to be this late every night. - Sorry. - You need a shower? No need. I'll go to bed right away. - You take a shower then. - OK. Come! - What? - It's alright! - What? What?! Shit! Idiot! Come on. Shit! Do something! Please do something! Why? Why don't you feel anything? Shit! Was he that good? I was wrong. I should've reported it to the police. What do guys mean to you? What do you mean? I am not talking about my brother. Just in general. There is nothing like a guy in general. Then we can narrow them down to just my brother. Was he as you expected? He's not the only person you had sex with, right? Hello? Uh? Yes. Please wait a moment. - It's Michiko's mother. - Really? Yes. - Eh? What happened to Miko? - She hasn't come home since last night. Yes. - Do you know anything about her? - Yes. We were together until around 10 pm... Yes. Yes. Sorry. Hello. Hey, Miko! What happened? I just got a phone call from your mom. What are you doing? Would you come here right away? I was raped. Raped? That guy. Jimmy Carter. I was with him yesterday. When I woke up, I was with him on the same bed. What's going on? Tell me everything. I don't know. I didn't do anything. I think he made me drink beer with some drug in it. When I woke up, I was in a hotel room, and he was with me. The only explanation is that he raped me, right? No, no, no, no! I never did anything! You didn't do a thing? Then why was I with you in the hotel room? Why did you put drugs in my drink?! I wanted to see it. The pussy of a virgin. I am not bad at all. I can't do it. I just wanted to see it. Mike's pussy. I saw it. That's a fact. But that's all. - What do you think? - I don't know. But I don't think he can figure out whether I was actually violated or not. Such as itchiness or pain. You are partially responsible for this so please hear us out carefully. Nothing much different. He says he can't show proof of innocence. I think he didn't do it. But... We can find out if we show her to a doctor, right? But only you really are a virgin. Yes, Mike's a virgin. I figured it out when I saw it. - Would you like to show a doctor? - Yes. You're too cruel, Mr. Tokuda. I know a doctor. I am going to introduce you to him. However, if the result is that you were raped, what are you going to do? - She's going to sue him! - A lawsuit? Are you two fucking retarded?! I told you last night. Nothing good happens when you hang out with this bunch. I just wanted to drink tea and dance with him. To drink tea and dance means you're offering up your pussy. What's the difference? Don't be angry. It's my fault. Miko is my angel. Criticize me instead! Several Days Later... You lied to me. You didn't come back last time. You hung out with Jimmy, didn't you? No way! Why? Doesn't matter. Don't lie to me, okay? - He is downstairs right now. - Huh?! Don't act weird around my mom or I'll withdraw the pardon I gave you. Sorry, I just wanted to see you. Don't act out. Would you like to dance with me, Miko? If you don't behave well, I'm not gonna let you in next time. Don't come near my daughter. You're wrong. Are you interfering with my life, mom? What? That's surprising. Let's dance! He is not serious about this. Yes, he is. He's a really good guy. That sounds stupid to me. Maybe it's stupid. But when I listened to his story, I got the impression that he was a poor guy. In other words, you're into him. You already fell in love. Don't talk like that. Meet him one more time at least. He will go back home soon. Long time no see. What are you going to do with Miko? I want to bring her to the States. I fell in love with her. - What? - I fell in love with her. But you're impotent! - You don't have the right. - No! I'm not like that. I won't fail her this time. Things seem to go well between you guys. Idiot! - Sorry. - Why can't I use the ashtray here? I am sorry. Do you think just saying sorry makes everything right? - Fix the problem as soon as possible. - I will replace it right now. I am very sorry. Please use it now. Fine. I am very sorry. Thank you for visiting. You seem like a good person. Still a bit unreliable though. I'll go back to the States tomorrow And I will come back to bring Miko over after I graduate from my university. That's good. - It...it hurts. -I'm sorry. I love you, Miko. What are you doing, Jimmy? I'm looking at it. Stop it, Jimmy! - Please...Be quiet... - Why? My sister is sleeping upstairs. - What? Don't lie to me. - It's true. I don't want it to be heard. Really? Got it. If you behave suspiciously, I will beat you. Don't look. It looks ugly. Don't look! Don't look! I won't come again. Sister-in-law! Please just leave her alone. Don't call! I beg you. Don't call. Call! Please call! 110! Please don't call! Why? What is this? It's embarrassing for both of us. Being dead is better than being degraded like this. What are you talking about? What? I feel ashamed. lam in despair. I am sure being dead is better than this! Please kill yourselves! 2 Weeks Later Why on earth do you have to quit school... after your brother and his wife got separated? She has become just like a janitor. And we don't have money. Why don't you work part-time at our bar? You can do great. I don't want to work at the bar with your mom. That's right. It's hard for you. Then what are you going to do after you quit school? I don't know. Maybe I'll just become a nun. That's right. Who knows? Being a virgin forever might be great. Don't mock me! Do you really think Jimmy will come back? If you think that way, don't give up. No matter how hard the job is, you have to do it. I will do it. I have already seen enough dirty things. Good. Then quit the school tomorrow and become my apprentice. Understood. Hey! It's OK if you start tomorrow sweetheart. That's alright, What's wrong? That's the guy?! He was so weird. What can I say? He had an awful vibe. He said he wanted me to draw him having an orgy with five blondes. - When was that? - Well... About a week ago. - Oh! - What? I've seen that guy. He often came by alone unexpectedly. Are you sure? Miki, can I have this drawing? Yeah, you can have it. And I want you to do one more for me. What is it? I have to do something for a while. Can you hire me after that? 1 Month Later Welcome. You're really into the job. Can I have a coke? - You don't have to drink. - Then give me a water. You can't even give me that? That guy seems to be gone. Already a month, right? But I'm going to wait a little longer. It is not easy, right? How's school? Any changes? Not at all. It's the same. And... - I got a letter from Jimmy. - Wow, that's great news! No, it isn't. He said he won't come to Japan. His father won't allow him to marry a Japanese girl. And he doesn't bring up the past because he wants to be a politician in the future. He wrote about all that in great detail. - What a weird foreigner. - Yeah, totally! Anyway, could you give me a drink? A coke, please. Whiskey. Double. Welcome. Long time no see. Welcome. - Are you a new bartender? - Yes. - Make this straight double. - Yes. What? You don't know how to do it? That's not the right order. - Sorry. - That's OK. - When did you start? - About a month ago. - Mister... - What? - Can I drink too? - That's great. Have a shot. You are quite enthusiastic for a new bartender. - Can she join us as well? - No problem. But since when has this place become a yakuza den? To drink this early... It's such a rare thing for cute girls like you. Yokosuka has changed completely while you were away. Oh, really? Would you like to dance? I... can't dance. We're actually classmates. - Classmates? Where? - A high-school. You girls are high-schoolers? That's shocking. - Hey! - Yes. Would you like to go some- where else? A better place. I have to ask her. - Her? - Her over there. - You are going if she goes? - Anyway, ask her please. - Hey, Her! - Can I help you? Can I go to somewhere else with her? -No! -Why? I have to go with her. - You are coming together? - Yes. Can you leave right now? Could you wait 30 minutes? And what kind of place do you have in mind? I don't care where. I have a car. Plucking two flowers at once... It's not a bad thing for me either. I just use the toilet for a second. Hey, what are you going to do? Everything alright? lam thinking about it. Where does he want to go? A hotel. Obviously! We are going to find out where he lives. When we find out where he lives, we can run away and plan things further. - But... he's scary... - Miko, please. Help me. Are you ready? Hurry up! Get in! Don't be afraid. I'm kind to women. Mister, what do you do? I... am a lawyer. - Liar! - How do you figure? - Lawyers earn a lot of money, right? - Yeah, I have a lot of money. I have a hard time figuring out how to spend it. You need some allowance? How much do you need? I don't want any! Right. lt's just all of sudden, I guess. Anyway, where do you want to go? Bring us to your house. I want to see what a lawyer's house looks like. - I agree. - Alright then. Mister, it seems you misunderstood. I wanted to go to your house. I don't think this is the place. This is my place. It looks great, doesn't it? Liar! That's not a lie. This is where I usually stay. Stop complaining. You wanted to do it right away, am I right? Let's try to run away when he's taking a shower. He should be distracted then. How do you two want to do it? - SM? - Yeah, that's some adult stuff. - Why don't you have a shower first? - I will go after you. You can go first. - You go first. - I don't want to. Go first. It's okay. What's the meaning of this? No! No! No! You bitch! What's up down there? I think you're not even a virgin! Stop! Stupid bitch! What's the matter? You're not acting like a good girl. You're stupid. No matter how much you resist, you won't succeed. Hey! Hey! I'm sorry. Are you okay? Miko! Hurry up! - Hey! What's this? - We did it! Kiko! You got raped? We'll pay him back! Stop! Are you kidding? Stop! Pull up his head! What is this? What are you doing to me? Be quiet! Shut him up! Help me! It hurts! Lick it! Lick it like a dog! Yes! Yes! More! More! This time lick Mike's foot. Yes! It tickles! Hey! Stop it! Are you bitches serious? Who do you think I am? Your name is Kanji Yamamura, right? So what are you gonna do, old man? Let's go. I will remember you, bitches! I'll remember! We know that already, Mr. Yamamura. He will definitely come back for revenge, right? Are we going to get killed? I won't run. I'm scared. Kiko! Look at this! What should we do? Give it to me. It's real. Give it to me. Miko! Get away from it! Kiko! The End
