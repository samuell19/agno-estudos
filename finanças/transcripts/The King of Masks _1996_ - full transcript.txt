Amitabha! Buddha of Infinite Qualities. She's attained Nirvana! Set off the firecrackers! Where's Young Master? Tianci? Where'd Tianci go? Tianci! Find him! Boss. If the princess died, how did she come back in the end? She turned into a god, like Bodhisattva. She's a good person, then? She does good deeds and rescues souls in strife. Come on, Doggie. Boss. Eat up, Boss. If only you were a boy. What do boys have that I don't? Just a little teapot spout. Does the goddess have a teapot spout? What goddess? Bodhisattva. Look, she's got bosoms. Why do you worship her? Grandpas and grandmas, uncles and aunties. Please bear with my meager skills. I'll thank you if you give money and if you don't. Next my master will perform. Thank you, auntie! Thank you, uncle! Go away. Grandpa! Boss! Boss! Boss! Fire! Help! Fire! Boss! Boss! Stop here. Master Liang. Old Master, here's that photo. I meant to send it to you earlier. You're too kind. And how's the little grandson? Gone off to play. How's he doing? He's surely learnt much by now. Not much to brag about. It'll do. - How much for a sweet potato? - 2 cents a catty. - One catty, please. - One catty. Take care. Little devil, stealing potatoes, are you? Looking for a hiding? Halt right there! Try that again and see if I don't beat you to death. Hurry. - Who's there? - Me. I've picked up another one. No willie on her, though. Come in. How are you with kids? Go on. Go up. Go. Have this too. Where's your family? What's your name? Tianci. - What? - Tianci. Go for it. Eight's wealth and love. Seven's clever, three's stars above. Drink up. Let's go. Come on. Careful. Hurry. What? You're sweet, but you'll never be a real grandson. Grandma's bridge is nigh... Grandma says I'm a sweetie pie. Where's Grandma's house? By the river. Who lives there? Grandma, Uncle and Auntie. What's Auntie do? She makes dumplings and noodles. - Sister, I have to pee. - All right. Come on. A little teapot spout. Grandpa would like you. I miss Grandpa. I do too. Tomorrow I'll take you to see Grandpa. My grandpa's the King of Masks. He's great! He'll feed you rice... and yummy meat dishes. Faithful one. Have you come to pray for an heir? Buddha, be merciful! I just want to ask if in this lifetime... I will have an heir to continue the family line. Guo Ziyi had many children in his home. Dou Yanshan's 5 sons with glory shone. The Yans produced 8 generals, tigers all. You have one stick ofjoss in your ancestral hall. Amazing! Alas, my one little seedling... Was trampled. Don't despair. Luck and misfortune are intertwined. Your fate holds a grandson. Where is he then? You will find him to the north of here, by water. To the north, by water? - Grandpa! - Who's your grandpa? The King of Masks. Who are you? What's your name? Tianci. Tianci..."Heaven sent"? You've a little teapot spout! You really are heaven sent! Tianci... tell Grandpa where you live. Dunno! What's your surname? It's Tianci. - Who brought you here? - Sister. Sister? What sister? Was it... Where is she? Doggie! Doggie! Doggie! Our country has witnessed... numerous child kidnappings. Tianci, 4, was taken from the prominent Wen family. He is 3'2", round face, black eyes... and was wearing brown pants and a blue gown. Grandpa Mask King! Grandpa Mask King! Master! - Mommy! Mommy! - Louder! Hurry. Tianci! Tianci! Tianci! Let Grandma see you. Mommy was worried to death about you. The King of Masks? Seems to be quite famous round these parts. He abducts people's children? - And the Wen child? - He's been taken home. What's that? A monkey. When we arrested him, the monkey followed. Officer. What's going on? The literati have their forums, the military their schools... the secret societies their hails and performers their stages. Surely, there is a place for reason. Stop prattling. What's your name? - My humble surname... - Stand up to speak! Is Wang. They call me King of Masks. So we've heard. A real street character. I wouldn't presume. I've only got a minor place in the Green Dragon Society. I trust my mates to look after me. Who are you calling your mates? If you belong to them, you know the rules. Break the rules and take the consequences. You make your bed, you lie in it. Now tell us how you've abducted those children. I swear before heaven and earth... and may I be struck down by lightning if I lie... I wouldn't dare do such a thing. Don't try confusing us with fancy talk. I'm asking you, how did the Wen boy end up on your boat? - You mean Tianci? - Yes. It was Doggie who brought him to me. - Doggie? - Yes. She knew I wanted an heir, a grandson. Go on. Which gang does Doggie belong to? What sort of nickname is that? An outsider or a local? Neither. She's just a little girl. About so tall and 8 years old. An 8-year-old girl? Bullshit! Looks like you've got a big-time case to answer for. Ready to confess yet? Hit him again. Confess! Sir, we wore him down. He's signed. Good. Let's hang all the kidnapping cases on him... and solve them in one stroke. Hurry. General! Come here. So, you've got company. He even volunteered for jail. Old man, here's a chamber pot. At least you won't be lonely. My grandpa didn't steal anyone's child. It was me. I don't know anything about your grandpa's case. But it'd be a damn shame if he were to die. Look, you go and play for a while. When I'm off, I'll meet you at the gate and got you in. Boss! Boss! Boss! I only wanted you to have a grandson. I never thought I'd get you into trouble. Boss! It's so unfair! So unfair! If there's mud in your pants... people will say you shit in them. Boss, punish me! Can't dodge what fate's got in store. Doggie, I don't blame you. It's fate. I accept it. Boss! I've brought your most precious things. What precious things? Let me have a look. Your masks, King of Masks. Take them with you to hell to scare off the demons. I've played with these my whole life. They're useless now. Didn't bring them into the world, can't take them when I go. I've broken the tradition. Broken it. Boss! It'll truly be a lost art. Boss! Don't cry, Doggie. In a former life... I must've wronged you badly... and now I'm repaying the debt. It was karma. Doggie... take General with you. I've given you comfort... taught you some skills. Burn spirit money for me... in the Ghost Festivals... and you'll have done the right thing by me. Boss! Boss! Don't cry. You old bastard, your granddaughter's saying good-bye... and you can't even give her a smile. - Come on. - Boss! Boss! Come here, Doggie. Quick. What are you planning to do about Grandpa? I don't know. Tears are no use. You know the Living Bodhisattva? The opera singer? He's Grandpa's friend and a big shot in this country. I think only he can help. Go find him. Living Bodhisattva! Living Bodhisattva! Master Liang, you'll catch a chill. No need. Spring is here. Living Bodhisattva, Master Liang! And you are? I'm Doggie, the King of Masks' grandson. The King's grandson? Doggie? Weren't you a boy? No, I was sold. What are you doing here? Grandpa's been arrested. You've got to save him! You're the only one who can. What's this all about? It's the grandson of the King of Masks! Tell me what happened to Grandpa, child. Come. Get up. Come. Come on. She needs care. The lightest breeze can blow you inside the prison gates... but the strongest ox can't pull you out again. Yet if he dies on these trumped-up charges... his art will die with him. Such a pity. Oh, please, save him! He has no other family. You are a fine, filial child. I'll do my best. Have some water. I've never even served my own father this well. But you don't have long to live. The monk has no sons, but so many are filial to him. You've always got a snappy answer. You can sacrifice your body but not lose an argument. You've only got 5 days left. Can't you say something nice? I've been framed. Framed! They said it was a local matter... rather involved too. They told me to stay out of it. Li Xiang. Give the child a bit of money. Help her out. Doggie. I can't save your grandpa. Doggie. We're just actors, both of us. We don't count for much in society. Master Liang. A sweet man doth seem this king. I shall test him with my flirting. And see if my hopes to him might cling. My horse, of Groom to me now bring The generals must be hastening General, you are a truly fine drummer and excellent singer. Really outstanding. The opera fans have really had a treat tonight. Everyone, today is my 66th birthday. Please join me for a feast at the Hall of Drunken Fairies. Great! General! The King of Masks was framed! Doggie? What opera is this? General, it's not an opera. It's a plea for help. Doggie, are you crazy? General, the King of Masks is no kidnapper! I rescued that boy and took him to the King. What is she talking about? I spoke to you about this a few days ago. I asked you to look into it. I told you the army can't interfere in local matters. What... If you won't help, I'll cut the rope and die. Don't be silly, Doggie! She's just trying to scare us. I don't believe she'll do it. Let's go eat. - General! - General! Doggie! General! Are you truly not moved by this child's actions... and her plea? Can you just stand by and do nothing? Do you have a heart of stone? Well, thank you for your previous kindness, but... I am taking this girl off to find justice... and will traverse the whole country if I have to. A terrible injustice has been done! A terrible injustice has been done! Hold it! You live up to your nickname of the Living Bodhisattva. Though merely an actor, you have courage and character. I may be a soldier, but I'm not a bastard. She's touched my heart too. I'll take care of this matter! A drop of compassion deserves a wellspring of gratitude. I really don't know how to... You know, back then... I didn't appreciate your offer. I'm happy to show you now... You misunderstand. I wouldn't dream of taking advantage of your misfortune. I wouldn't be worthy of the brotherhood of the streets if I did. The world is a cold place... but we can bring warmth to it. What other enjoyment would there be to life? Master Liang. Please, Old Master, rise. Please, rise. Sit down. You shouldn't thank me anyway. Thank Doggie. Doggie is your true savior. Doggie! Doggie! Boss! Doggie! Call me Grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!
