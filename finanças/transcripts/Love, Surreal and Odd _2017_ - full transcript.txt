The number you dialed is switched off or out of coverage area. That bear turned off his phone! he's there - Excuse me? - The Big Dipper. - It's there. - I don't understand you. Let me show you it like this. besides that thing, that group of stars that looks like a coffeepot, This group, which looks like a jug, doesn't quite look like him, but it... It looks like a jug. It doesn't look like a vase either, I'm afraid I got you confused. Pan. okay. It looks like a frying pan. You will see her. - See? - I see a missionary there. - I think I got lost. - Forget the herald. - Leave it. - All right. It made me think of her. Forget it. over there. on the right Behind that, there is a cluster of kite-like stars. It is on its side. Big Dipper group. She is there. It's really easy to locate, why did you find it so difficult? I had to take my eyes off the missionary. I would have found it immediately. okay. Easy to locate. I Let me confess to you, since I was a kid, people have been pointing to him in front of me, but I... I've never seen him as a bear. I guess you're not interested in astrology. - But I don't hate it either. - I'm not really into it. Bakiza is very interested in these things. Bakiza is the girl who made an appointment with me today. - We were going to meet here. - Did someone miss you too? okay. And you? - Me too. I was supposed to meet Khairy, the man I was trying to contact. - That's it! - We usually meet. What a scoundrel! Maybe we should introduce Kizeh to Khairy, but they're going to miss the date, so... - They will never meet each other. - Right. Flannery. I don't know what to do now.I'm starting to sweat. I mean I can't think of anything now. Do I have to shut up until I think back, or can I speak? because I I'm afraid you will turn away if I close my mouth. I will not leave if you close your mouth, but you will close your mouth if you do. - I beg your pardon? - I uttered this phrase because it sounded beautiful. It has a deep meaning if you think about it, but... - Indeed. - Really? 'Cause if you leave, I'll be alone, and I'm the kind of person who misses someone's appointment with me too. If I leave, I will have nothing to do but silence. Silence will not come from the one left behind. The one who leaves is the one who creates the silence. This is exactly the idea. The one who leaves is the one who creates the silence. Good thinking. - Don't you want something with that? - With what? I mean... the meat or the main course. What do you want to eat with him? - More broccoli, for example. - Broccoli? They always recommend him on TV shows, But I don't... - Do you want to eat shawarma? - Let's go. Let's go Where do you know Toluihan from? - Who? - Toluihan. - Who is Toluihan? - Toluyhan. our friend. I didn't know the full name, How about an acronym of endearment? Toluihan is the owner of this party. - Thank you. - You're most welcome. Friend close... From one of my friends... He has a friend who works in a supply company She works with the owner of this party, Toluihan. And that person who works in the supply company, His girlfriend is a close friend of mine. "Sinai". Sinai called me and said, "Let's go." I told her, "Sure, as long as we have mutual friends." Otherwise, it would be embarrassing. What about you You are not as close to him as you are, you are like a member of his family. I think you laughed, didn't you? In fact, I also don't know Tully very well, he's a friend of a friend of mine. And my friend is the one who calls it endearment. I don't know him enough to call him a short endearment. Obviously, they should abbreviate his name, so why would they call him by his full name? exactly. This would be more accurate. If his father knew his name would be "Touli", Would he have called him "Toluihan"? I mean, he called him “Toluihan.” He must have been expecting a lot from him. I've never spoken to anyone about such a ridiculous subject for so long. This seemed a little romantic to me. It seemed to me as well. After all, we've been talking about Toluihan for two hours. He is someone we don't know. - Where the hell did you come from? - I told you. I'm a friend of a friend of "take over". - Shall we find this Toluihan? - Why? I don't know, we can talk to him about himself. OK Let me tell you something. I think it would be fun to do silly things with you, ma'am. I think I'd be happier if I dropped the formalities between us. - Shall we go? - Let's go. Then I took off my shoes and started running. Oh really You are funny by nature. thank you. Some of my friends say I tell great jokes. Oh really? I would like to join them someday. - I mean, I'd laugh a lot. - Of course. Tell me a joke. - Now? - Yes. OK Since you asked so suddenly, I can't think of any joke. Jokes can't be remembered all of a sudden. But I will tell you one. OK. I have one Well, what man He loaded his donkey and took it up the mountain, and he saw a woman there. Bitter... I can't tell it to you because it's a dirty joke and an insult to women. It will not be convenient for you. But I have another joke. Well Well A Turkish, an Italian and an Englishman boarded a plane. The pilot grabbed the microphone and said... I can't tell you that joke either. It contains a social message. Let's enjoy the evening. - Well. - Well, I have another joke. I will definitely tell you this. But don't make me tell it to you if you already know it. - Know what? - The joke I'm about to tell. - You haven't seen her yet. How do I know what it is? - What if I remember it after I reach the middle of it? - Would that be disastrous? - No. It wouldn't be disastrous, of course. But it would spoil my enthusiasm. When one's in the midst of telling a joke, Someone says, “Oh!” Why would someone interrupt me while I was telling a joke? Let me finish it. What a person! Let's start with the matter of telling the joke, if you want to. Since we're already in the joke quagmire... I mean, I might remember the joke a lot easier. It's impossible to tell a joke you haven't seen yet, right? indeed. you are right. I'll tell it to you right now. This joke is very funny.One of my friends told me about it. It's not a simple joke. It must be unique since its preamble lasted for two hours. Listen... timmel is going to a bar one day. And as he was about to enter through the door, a door of a different kind... Would you rather I narrate it casually or accent it? - I'll go get a drink. - I'll tell it to you with an accent. He said, "I spent a lot of money on a drink. Give me some snacks..." The history my parents told me is a little complicated. I've always been upset about the fact They don't remember my exact date of birth. If you had a child, you must take the date. December 4th or April 25th...you have to write that down somewhere. This is your child. How were you born exactly? In fact My mom doesn't know anything about that. Grandmother asked: "Grandma, when were you born?" I also asked her: "How were you born?" I want to imitate her because she died. - My condolences. - Thank you. “When they dried the apricots, your mother suddenly went into labour. And when the cotton buds were clothed with cotton, you were born.” This is what she told me. - What did she say about the apricot? - "They dried it." - What does that mean? - They dried it. Your words are full of accents. I think if they were drying apricots, it must have been at the end of summer. But if the cotton sticks are covered with cotton, it must be in the beginning of June. The problem must be with the cotton buds or in my family. No, I'm sure the problem is with the cotton buds. She must have been dressed in cotton after her time. Then when I finished studying economics in six years, they were very embarrassed. Doesn't it take four years to study economics? indeed I have to leave now. If you want to contact you... I don't know your phone number. Should I dial a random 10-digit number? That would be ridiculous. Or can you help me with that? Are you on Instagram? No. We are from Boyabat. Social media It's my weak point. give me your number I will save it on my phone. I will send you a message. I'll finish the letter with an emoticon, that would be nice. But emojis are a bit complicated, and I don't like all of them. For example, someone's smile is exaggerated. That laughing face that sheds tears, so don't send that face to me. There is a face with a slight smile. His smile is respectable. Send me that face. And do not send me the red-headed face and the two horns of Satan. I don't like it. There is an expressive smile on the tip of his mouth. I will send that face. And that red heart. the big heart that pulsates. How can it be sent? Did you perform the latest update on your phone? No, we are from "boypats". - I see. - So... Tell me your number so I can record it. OK Record it then. You've talked a lot, so sign up now. "Add a new name." really What is my telephone network Can you guess my telephone network? What type of person are you? I wish you appeared in my dreams. Wow! Expressive face. Well, here I am recording. Hello I searched for it online. It is called the "Grand Coffin Daughters". - On what? - Big Dipper. - So then? - Yes. I studied everything related to it. It is among 88 other constellations. I wanted to run and call you as soon as I knew this secret. I don't know why I ran, but... I hope I'm not bothering you. of course not. You rushed here. I can call you back after I take a break. OK. I'll wait. - God willing. You have an answer to everything. You don't have a problem with that either. - Sorry, I eat cherries. - In good health. We'll talk more if things continue like this. I see that too. But fear started creeping in. The moment? Because you are silent. My mouth is silent. But my insides dance with joy. Oh really inside me too. we didn't talk About our favorite foods. - Do you like sushi for example? - No, I don't like sushi. But I like fish very much. If you want to eat rice with fish, I choose rice with anchovies. - “Anchoshi.” - What? "Anchoshi". - Did you invent that? - Yes. "Anchoshi". you are funny Have you visited Zonguldak before? No I also did not visit her. Shall we visit it together? - And why Zonguldak? - We can go to the Bahamas part too. As long as we travel... I love to travel. We have to go somewhere, but you don't know where? Is that what you mean? No. I didn't mean it. - But you said it. - I didn't say it. - Yes. OK. Maybe you touched on that a little bit. - But I didn't go into it. - All right. See how right I am? Venice"? Do you visited her before this time what do I mean I don't know... With one of your ex-girlfriends... Have you visited her before? No. We have not visited Venice. do not worry. We met only yesterday, And now we're planning to go on vacation. who knows Because I saw on the Internet that Seeing the constellation "Daughters of the Big Coffin" is a good omen. Oh really? Tell me about it. It is said that everyone asks each other if they have seen it. It is written here: "If two people see it at the same time... - They'll get along.” - I can't believe it. I can not do that I Nothing comes by chance. And I... I realized that again. When I went to the party, and if Bakiza hadn't missed her date with me, And if I don't come up here, if I don't see the Big Dipper, And if I hadn't mistakenly thought you were looking for him, Why would any of this happen? what about me Without Khairy, it would be impossible to... We had a game that night, and I broke my date with friends. No way. Nothing happens by chance. - I fell back into silence again. - No. Let's not fall into silence again. Just as one of us shouldn't leave the other, okay? - Well. - Will you promise me that? - I promise. - I want a firm promise. This is a firm promise. OK then When are you going to eat anchoshi? I liked it very much. Add milk with garlic. Is this enough? No Put a little butter with dried sweet pepper on the table. This would make everything edible. If you put this on a shoe, you can eat it! welcome - Are you still with me? Hello. - I'm with you. I remained silent as I tried to avoid that smell. I also chewed on the leather of the shoes, in my mind. - Where? - In my mind. in your mind. Don't like garlic? In your mind? Not when it's in someone else's mouth. I love her so much. So what can we do? I'll compromise, so that you eat less. We will eat it at the same time. exactly I've been thinking about this dilemma for years. How is the word "garlic" spelled correctly? It ends with the letter m. This is not important. But it must be important. Maybe that's because people can't pronounce it well. - That's why her spelling doesn't matter. - I think we can finish this conversation For future reference, if we can find a topic... I bet you can't repeat the last sentence you said. I wouldn't repeat it anyway, you idiot. - Well. - What were we talking about? We did not focus on a specific topic. Just two people chatting. This means that we can talk even if there is no particular topic. This is very important. I see that too. Because one cannot talk to some people even if there is a certain topic. Sinai like this. It talks about all possible subtopics first. Then enter the bottom line after that. Lots of people I know are like this, too. I don't think you can repeat her last sentence either. Many people I know... Of course I can't as long as you ask me like that! You can't say that sentence about preservation What was it? Yes, I can. I think we can end this conversation... for a moment... I think we can end this conversation for... I can't do it again, you idiot. What did I tell you? The bomb? "I think it would be very interesting to do silly things with you." I think you said that. Do you laugh or rub the headphones with something? listen... On our first date, I'll put some oil on your tonsils. That squeaking should go away. You idiot! thank you. I'm an idiot, as you say. I will call you back It squeaks! see you later I haven't spoken to anyone until dawn in a long time. How about we don't hang up until we meet? Shall we continue our conversation? So that when you come to pick me up, our call goes on? We go bankrupt. The police can bring me that bill. You exaggerate. We'll be fine as long as you don't tell a joke. So let me tell you a joke: A man had no credit on his phone. So he went to the phone store and said, "Dude..." Stop making that accent, please. OK. This is a completely untrue joke. See? I even made you laugh at a joke that didn't even exist. I'm very cute and sociable. - Really? - Abu Zarif Muasher, too. He likes to tell jokes, but gets angry when someone laughs. ولمَ؟ I do not know. Maybe my father tells jokes because there is a lesson in it, - Not to make people laugh. - Let's say I met your father. Should I not laugh when he tells a joke? You may laugh. But don't show him that. Just a little smile on the tip of your mouth. Then go to your room and laugh there. I have a grandmother and her name is Shohret. She laughs all the time. Sometimes we make jokes when you laugh, To make her laugh logical. We can introduce my father to your grandmother, Shohret. They would make a great couple and make us laugh. I have a question When you first saw me, what did you think of? Do you know when I first thought of you? The party music was loud. And they were handing out canapes, remember that? I saw you standing in the corner, and I was about to get close to you... But some fool was standing next to you. He was trying to get close to you. - "Benjamin." - Whatever. I do not know him Then I felt very confused. When did you think of me? I didn't think of you. let me see That It's called komos in my town, and it lives in three cavities. You can't imagine how bad it smells. Shall we hang up? - You turn off your phone first. - No, you turn off your phone first. - No, shut you down. - Shut you up. We got into a vicious circle of "close you first." And soon this episode will suffocate us. If we end the call immediately, that won't happen. Quickly OK. You shut down first. You have strangled us. really Let's escape to the hang-up phase at once. OK. But without joking, we count to three and end the call. Count to three and end the call. one by one - Two... - Two... Hey, hey, hey. Neither of us said a final word. Are we going to end the call like this? - Let's say: “Bye bye.” - What? "Bye Sweet dreams are better than that. sweet Dreams - Sweet dreams. - But you have to see me in your dreams. OK How do you want me to see you? What do you put on you? over there Kind of weak, hope it's not something serious. I mean, what are you wearing? wear It's not fancy clothes. Sports jacket and leggings. - Are you wearing leggings? - Yes. - Are they too tight? - The leggings are too tight. But you can say it's too narrow if you like. I want that Very tight I have drifted away. You ascribe sexual meanings to normal clothes. But you told me to see you in my dreams. I told you to see me, not... to imagine me like that. But you said it was leggings. - Shall we stop? - About this? No, it's about talking on the phone.When we hang up, We too have finished. OK Take care of your tight pants. - Turn off your phone. - Let's get ready. One, two wait wait. Let's count down from 3. This is more interesting. - Three... - Three... - Two... - Two... OK Let's count down from ten. Meanwhile, I'll forget about your leggings. - Well. - Ten... - Ten. - Nine... nine - Eight. - Eight... I don't care if we start counting down from 100. I can't forget that! - Let's count down from three. - All right. - Three... - Three... - Two... - Two... one by one - Zero - Zero. This is very strange. As long as nothing happens by chance, To the truth of the fate that brought us together at that party. Toast to the health of our meeting? - That's right. - All right. You shouldn't make me drink. Whatch out - Why? - You already drank a glass, didn't you? - Yes. - Pour me another glass. surely I will take the second cup. And I was gone... right after the second cup. Watch me now. I'm going to be a different person now, But I will return to myself. I'll be back to be myself when the drunkenness wears off. do not worry Under normal circumstances, I would not have drunk at such a dinner with you. I don't like drinking either, but it's the exigencies of social life. - Sometimes one needs... Will you fill my glass? - Yes. surely For example, do not know what to say. Should I say, "No, I won't drink?" Should I have said that Not to put myself in the position that I will be in shortly? I met a wonderful person. - Thank you. - Don't misunderstand me, We are in a wonderful restaurant. Me... was it April or March? That was in March. I came here in March. Then I refrained from entering when I saw the prices at the door. A person may lose his mind In such a wonderful environment? I mean, why would someone get drunk and stutter... here we are Let me tell you something. It's the first time I've seen someone. Drunk quickly in front of me. - Really? - Yes. I have not seen the process process in such a sequential manner. But... this is the situation that plagues me... give you an advantage. I will be proud of myself, - But I'll be quite honest. - Really? To the maximum extent. I Very honest. Where's my hairpin? For example, I... keep filling my glass. little more What were you talking about? Yes, honesty. It is the best of... I am completely honest. For example, the sad story I had with my ex-boyfriend... We separated and then we got back together, Let's separate again... So we go back to each other. Then, we got back together again. Let's find out we didn't even break up before we got back together one last time. So it was preposterous for us to come back to each other in this case. We separated again. Understood. So your recent breakup was unreasonable. We got back together again. Then we broke up again. It's all over Don't be afraid of anything. Oh! - No. - It's over. It's been 6 months since the last time, it's over and I'm over it. Do you not communicate at all, even on the phone? No. Call me once. But I never called him. Sometimes I write a letter. But I don't send it. This is not mine. On birthdays, etc... Shall we have a glass of that...? They offer it on flights. - What is that thing? - "My..." Red drink with tomatoes. - “My Mary.” - What? - “My Mary.” - What? okay. How did you know him? seriously Did you repeat it again? You pronounce his name beautifully. - “My Mary.” - “My Mary.” But it's only delicious on flights. - Here we are. - Why is that? Do we have to file a complaint? So let's have some nuts. We should order coffee for the pilot, And to eat nuts. As soon as the busy bathroom light goes out... We'll go to the bathroom. But we have to get on a plane first, honey. Oh really I can't believe it. Flying is my favorite job. - When are we going? - I don't know. I think we should go to my house. You brat! You are a naughty person. I wasn't convinced. Not while I'm drunk. Not and I'm out of my senses. I've waited so long. Very long 6 months 6 months for a sample. We won't do it... When I can't remember anything after that, check it out. OK OK, where are you I'm here. I'm here my dear. OK then. Listen. - What? - Shall I drive you home? - Of course. - Where do you live? - "Mississippi" - "Mississippi". Do I type "mesitastanga" in the GPS? Not Mist, you idiot. It's Ostpostanga. Understood. I'll ask for the invoice then. - And a buggy. - What? - I was kidding. - Shut up! Shut up! What kind of joke is this? - That's great rudeness on your part. big! Shut up! - It's a joke, my dear. Making a joke about a buggy On a beautiful woman I told you a while ago That she can't stand drinking is so rude. - It was just a joke. - Shut up! Bald one! Do not open your mouth. Just give me directions to Misastanga. I can go by myself. In addition to I am so grateful for the restaurant for this wonderful service. And if you adjust a little of your prices, That would be very cool.You can pay the account here. - I'll pay the bill. - Shut up! O fat! O you who are fat! Where is Misastanga located again? Oh, Bosphorus Bridge. No traffic now and I will... - Get out of here. - Hey. There is no traffic. Hey. Hey. OK. Then come with me. Wow! These candles are wonderful. Candles fit this atmosphere. If we cross the Bosphorus bridge... I'll check the traffic app on the phone. There is no traffic. Come on I am sleepy do not sleep. No! do not sleep Hey. come My skirt has fallen off. OK. decent - And my artificial eyelashes fell off. - Well, we'll check on that. - Here's my handbag. - Don't worry. Waiter, the bill, please. - There is no traffic on the Bosphorus bridge. - Well, we'll go from there. Oh cute! What is that Hand it to me. Among the celebrities, which woman do you admire the most? - Me? - Yes. Nicole Kidman Oh really? I think her skin is too white. I just said that. It's my official response. I thought you might get mad if I told you his real name. - And who is she? - "Kim Kardashian". From? "Kim Kardashian I do not believe this What people see as a flaw in others, they see as an advantage in this woman. You cannot find such a defect in all women. correct. Its flaw is very huge. What about you My downside...before I lost some weight, I was... Don't ask for it. - It's about your favorite celebrities. - Oh! In fact Al Pacino is getting old now. Leonardo is always too young. Only George Clooney remains. Actually, I want to sing this conversation with a song If you want to. I loved George Clooney, But I didn't love him back. OK. Is enough. Let's change the subject. OK. We have better things to talk about anyway. What do you mean For example, this will be the first movie we watch together. This is interesting to me, too. Because at some point, if I can... I intend to hold your hand. Oh, that's why I chose the 11:45 PM show. That was a coincidence. And how do you intend to do that? - A spontaneous touch at first? - Of course. Look, like this. I want your hand. - Which hand? - This is better. Put a hand on the seat cushion. Then I put my hand next to yours. from such a distance, I can feel the warmth of your hand, but there's no contact between them. And if you get mean, I'll run straight away. Let's just suppose meanness doesn't have me. This means that things are going well. Then if we stay like this, I tend to lean my body a little. Like I'm telling you a joke. I do not know what to say And while you laugh... I will hold your hand. We are now In the midst of our first official holding each other's hands. You would never leave her, would you? Start I'll even leave my hands with you when I drive you home. - Shall we join our fingers? - Gladly, at once. As we joined our fingers, I might pamper your thumb a little bit. - Your hand is so warm. - Thank you. - You won't sweat, will you? - No. If you give her good ventilation, she won't sweat. The movie started. what should we do - Let me... if you want. - Yes. So... please. We walk hand in hand on a snowy night. If there's snow and someone grabs my hand, I'll notice. I mean, we just started the journey. Perhaps we have begun a journey from which there is no return. ربّما. But... nobody knows, I mean... Maybe one of us gets cold to the other. Where he does not call the other and does not answer his messages. You know that moment when you see those two blue lines On the WhatsApp application, you wait for a response that never comes. Do you understand me It is clear that the other party saw your message and read it, but did not respond to you. Maybe the only thing you can do is accept that pain. In fact, I have changed My social status on Facebook goes to "It's serious this time." I think that's a sufficient guarantee, perhaps. Maybe we should stop saying "maybe" so much. Shall we shut up and kiss each other? - In the middle of the street? - Perhaps. Let's not do that. You were overwhelmed with feelings after you held my hand. Maybe we don't have to kiss each other in front of people, But we can hug each other as much as we want. You are very poetic tonight. - Then let me kiss both sides of your mouth. - Kiss what? - Both sides of your mouth. - What? Where your cheeks meet your lips. - Stop. - I'll show you how to do it. No - Hack. - Stop! - Honey. - Yes? - Can you turn this off? - What? Drying machine. Can you turn it off? - All right. Sometimes I feel like I'm reborn when that machine goes out. OK What are you doing - I'm thinking. - What? - How can I tell you. - Tell me what? What I think. Honesty is salvageable. OK - I'll be honest, then. - What's the matter? The matter... A while ago, we did this... That I'll call it reproduction... Well understood. Is that...? You mean we slept together? Is that the matter? okay. That's exactly. You are While we were doing this, you shared out loud... in the event. "at the event"? - Did that bother you? - No. No. I don't mind about that, but... At some point, I thought you got mad at something. - When you were jingling like that. - Jingle? Are you sure you want to use that word? He thought of using the word "scream" at first, but it was an obvious jingle. The neighbors must have heard it. - Stop! Really? - Yes. When they "scream", I can hear them. This was Golgotha, they must have heard it. OK. Next time, I'll keep my excitement in silence. I can just shake. When I feel something so intense, I'll just shake hard. in this way What do you do What do you do I want to tell you this then. I guess you were like... The movie "The Silence of the Lambs". Silence of the Lambs"? Stop it! At one point, I wasn't even sure you even existed. - It must have been your loud thud. - Really? okay OK Then I'll raise my horn. I'll scream too, if you like. Loudly I fell in love with you And I fell in love with you. You say that but you don't call me, I don't know... What are you saying? I even want to call you right now while I'm talking to you. And I want to talk to you all the time in every possible way. Well then, call me. I'm available. - Really? OK Hello Hello In the manner of maintenance workers. "welcome - I hope I'm not bothering you. - No. For now, see In my eyes, my love. When can we meet tomorrow? Is 3 o'clock a good time? - All right. - With the Romeo numbers. I love you Oh really? You have to say it again. - I love you. - Say it with an echo. I love... k... - Add vibration to that. - I love you. Say it sympathetically with a shake. See what I'm going to do. What do you do I'm not a smartphone, so I'm going to fall off the table while shaking. What do you do Still decorating. My friend finishes painting an entire building in the same period. From inside and outside Is this the law, my dear? Are women always late? My mom is like her too... they all are. what do you say Wow! Intense red lipstick. And a shirt that shows off a lot of your chest. What kind of shirt is this? Why do you put so much cosmetics, is that necessary in those places? What is your idea of ​​where we are going? In my opinion, we will meet somewhere and eat kofta in the garden of a house. This is called a barbecue. I'm sorry. I'm not used to those barbecues. Sorry Do you get nervous when you shouldn't? - I think so. - Why? The person who's making the meatballs is your ex-boyfriend, is that a good reason? Are you going to discuss it with me now? My relationship with "Corsat" ended years ago. People were making love years ago, too.We can tell from the films of that era. I hold a degree in economics. My relationship with Korshat was short but full of respect. How long did that short, respectful relationship last? - For about three months? - Enough time for him to see your breasts. If I say "breast" one more time, there's going to be a big problem between us. Couldn't find anything And now you're trying to create a problem. No, but I don't understand how people can meet their former lovers again. "Hi. I'm going to introduce you two. This is my ex-boyfriend. And this is my current boyfriend, and I think this is my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend. This must be her ex, too. It's great that we all know each other's body details. Listen, why don't we get together on Sundays Shall we dance naked together? We should always do activities like dancing. Wouldn't that be cool?" Listen, you can't judge my past relationships. But there are men as well on the list... - Who do you mean? - What was that dwarf's name? Not a dwarf! It was just short. It was very short. One could describe it as "extremely short" too. It was like a plant. Think about it, at the end of the dance group. "Oh, it's tiny. Don't step on it." - What was his name? - Taqi al-Din. "Peaceful Religion"! He's short, and his name is long. They at least wanted his name to sound long.

He won the award for the shortest scientist of the year! are you coming or not Doubts invade my mind. - Is he also invited? - Who? Taqi al-Din technical and scientific. I made his name longer.

Let's gather our former good friends every weekend and have a meeting. at this time People can meet their ex-boyfriends with their regular friends. OK It was also Taqi al-Din who introduced me to Korshat. - Really? - Yes. How did you introduce him? "(Corchat), I'm not tall enough! Can you handle her boobs instead of me?" I said the word "breasts" again. How rude! Gosh! I do not understand this Then I should meet up with my ex-girlfriends and cook steaks with them. We have to meet too! I must also say: "(Halima), come and stand here." Then we all dance together, naked. "Come here, Nordin. I was..." Hurrah Do we have to do that? I will go. Are you coming or not? - Listen.

What did you just say? - What? - Did you say we could do it? - What? - I said, "We can do it," I suppose. My words were out of anger. You may have said that unintentionally. You can't just say that, you have to turn it into a marriage proposal. - What shall I transfer? - The question of marriage. Understood - We've come to that point, then? - That's a big surprise to me, too. For me, too. Should I kneel? - We're both kneeling now. - Indeed. Where did you come from? the burden of a thousand-year-old tradition on my shoulders, I will kneel. It happened so suddenly I didn't expect it. neither am I You have confined me to this corner.

You grumbled a lot. Was it a bad idea to go to Paris for our honeymoon? okay. It's been a bad idea since the tour company you hired came into existence. I felt like an animal in a circus for a week. The whole time there was a woman calling In the name of the company "Chetor" in all airports, and we were following it. We didn't take any vacation.We were going from airport to airport until we got back. I swear if someone called and said "chitor," I'd run again. We just got back from our honeymoon, but you're talking like you're a Titanic survivor. I was confused from the start when I saw that ad Which says: "Four days, bed, breakfast and dinner. 500 euros." But I was relieved when I saw that hotel room in Paris. We paid a large amount. But it was the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. As I brushed my teeth in front of the mirror in the bathroom, The toothbrush fell into the toilet at a 90-degree angle. Did you brush your teeth during our honeymoon? - I didn't notice. - I was washing it, but the brush fell into the toilet. - Really? - Should I have picked it up and moved on? No, that's not what I'm saying. Also, every time we shower, our bed gets wet. Our luggage was placed in front of the door! At least there was hot water. But there was no cold water!This is a much bigger problem. I got burned! OK. what ever - The girls' perfume bottles are here, aren't they? - Honey, let me ask you a question. while on vacation, Whenever I see a women's clothing store, Especially if it's a brand you love. By the way, I noticed you like all the brands, - Something happens to you. What's the reason for that? - Like what? You're running as soon as you see the brand. You make it like they don't sell underwear, It's the secret of the universe at Eleanors Secret. When you see me wearing it, you'll love it. - Really? - And don't be unfair. Because every time I ask you: “Honey, do we have enough time to take a look at this store?” But you never waited for my answer. But every woman you know loves to shop, right? - Yes. - Why are you trying to change that? correct. All this is useless. Don't tire yourself out then. Gosh Also, Paris was a beautiful place. I loved her. It would have been a better place If only you weren't always arguing with our tour guide. "Tour guide", would you still call that idiot a tour guide? I won't believe how you describe people from now on. tourist guide"? The only difference between us and him is that it was his second visit to those places. They sat him next to the driver and handed him a microphone. then "The building to my left... I think it's..." See? He is not certain, but he thinks! Who cares about the building? - What do you think about this? - What? As the bus was going, he was holding the microphone: "The green park to my left...Here it is! Driver! Slow down, I can't speak fast. Oh cute!" You imitate it aptly. do not make me laugh. My face will wrinkle.I bought a lot of ointments from Paris. At 400 euros. - She had a discount. - Fortunately. Don't be unfair. Get close. Wasn't there anything good about our entire honeymoon? You idiot! - There must be something good, you idiots. - Really? I think it's our honeymoon It included a part that we could romantically call the "wet bed." Our bed may have been too close to the shower cabin, but we... We were able to make that to our advantage. We got to a point where it lasted for 17 minutes. We will not surrender! We will do more. We'll get to 50 and 60 minutes. - Why can't we do it like the others? - Sure. - Any others? - Those who can. Listen You cannot train with others to improve your performance. I will kill you What are you talking about, my dear, my sweetheart and the apple of my eye? You have reached that point with you, and it cannot happen to anyone else. my dear. Sweetie You can gain the sweetness of the tongue whenever you want. Distilled honey. Oaks grow in the mountains where Camille roamed. Hello Let's go to bed. - Won't you take a look? - At what? What just hit you? sudden chills; Could this be because of the message? - What? - Goosebumps. what do you mean Why might no one read a message? When is he at his wife's side? What would make him nervous? What is the reason for hesitation? Why would I get nervous? I can read it. I can even answer it. I have nothing to hide. I studied economics. Why don't you read it then? - Read what? - The letter. Why do you get the impression it's a bad message? It may be an advertising message. It may be an announcement of a discount for vacation in the resort "Kemer". It could be a message from the phone company about my balance or internet consumption. For example: "You have 10 megabytes left." - Can we take a look at that letter? - Hey. Will you check every message we get? No, but we should be able to check out some of them from time to time. Like the inspector who comes up all of a sudden when we're at school. At this time, when all schools are closed? Can we read this message? I think of those nights we used to meet In the corners of the wet unit. (Ariff)." Arv drunk. ‫"آريف".‬ someone who thinks of you In the corners of the wet unit. Where are those wet corners located? And what exactly were you doing with Ariv in those corners? calm down Arief feels the need to arrange poetry. I think we owe this bad verse to her poetic flair. Otherwise, Ariv's feelings would have taken me by surprise, too. I don't know which of the two things I fear more: The possibility that this "Ariff" is real Or could it be a pseudonym? - Experts can understand it. - Understand what? It's a pseudonym, my dear. You may have encountered the same problem. You know those old names, one has to change them, I mean... If you add a man to your phone contacts as "Baby", You have to change it of course. I also changed it. wiped "baby" And I wrote the full name of that person. But I don't change 'ariv' to 'mobira' for example. OK. "Wet corners of the unit." Our poetess used a smiley face here It can be understood as a sign to some sexual fantasies. Maybe that bitch used a rhetorical question here. Madam As an etiquette teacher, don't you think the word "sloppy" is a rough spell? Can we get real information from you about the identity of this poetess? Or let me rephrase the question: Who is this lowly bitch? Madam before my relationship with you, Before you came into my life, during that relationship, In order to avoid relationship problems, This is a number you saved as "Arive", This is to prevent problems in the relationship, In order to prevent this from having another relationship, This is a number that has been saved as "Arive", but has not been used since. He remained as “Arif.” That's the point. - What? - She's just an old friend. No. It doesn't look that old. It's still wet. When we met, it was drought. This was the period when the water shortage hit Istanbul. It was then.The humidity must have come after that. OK. How did she have the courage to send you a message at this hour? Alcohol maybe. How does she know your number? It might be the deep state. Who is? Tell me. - In the past, the distant past, This was a number I memorized after one intimate night, But it was not used after that. I mean, a new contact was created but I didn't engage with it. I don't even remember Arief's original name. Oh really No Wet corners. There is more than one corner. You have met more than once. Wow There are many doubts. I'm going to bed now. OK And you will sleep here. Because the humidity of this room It fits you perfectly now. very good Will I sleep on this... I've been waiting for you for three years, but you haven't. And after you got married, you're talking about the wet corners. "Ban (Ariff)." I have many things to do. Looks like you brought in a lot of tomatoes, honey. Are you going to start a tomato sauce making company? Guess who you met at the store. Let me ask you the question like this. Guess the person you used to love and met at the store? - I loved him? - Yes. - Woman? - Are there men you like? .. I went to the store, finished the first section. And when I was about to enter the vegetable section, I saw... - It's joyful, God willing. - I don't know if it's joyful. I haven't resolved it yet. What I saw There was a woman in the cleaning department, who was walking like a... - Like what? - You walk like that. How did she walk? This is what I was asking about. I would have said, "Like idiots," if I hadn't known she was your ex. Understood While I was wondering if I should avoid her, she saw me. We ignored each other in a way It caught people's attention more than if we yelled at each other. you should have seen it, She put her head among the cleaning materials like... like crazy. And you started picking tomatoes like crazy. I was normal. But he was driven crazy by her anger. Her hands were trembling so hard that foaming detergent appeared. Then you got the idea of ​​tomato sauce. Honey, haven't you said "tomato sauce" a lot? Darling, you ran into my wife and I was upset, Although it is very normal. - What? - What did you just say? - When? - Just now. You said, "What did you just say?" I replied, "When?" Before that - Tomatoes, tomato sauce... - "Honey, you came across..." Fill the void - Fill it in. - Well, well. "my wife But enough, my dear! - My ex-wife. - But you didn't say "ex". - But she's my ex-wife. - That's a complete mockery of me! - I am your wife. - Of course you are my wife. She's known to be nervous, so why are you nervous now? They call her "nervous guzen". She was probably nervous because of the cleaning products, not you. When Gozen is hesitant, she trembles like this. how? tell me Yeah, did you get angry about that? - Of course, I'm wrong. I'm an idiot. - Stop! Tell me for God's sake. Can you show me how you shiver? When you hold a fork, for example, you can't point it to her mouth like that. She shudders when she thinks about what to eat. This didn't go "Gozen". I do not believe you Show your longing expression with a goofy smile on your face... I wish you had run into her instead of me since you miss her so much. - What does this have to do with it? - It has a great relationship. If you love each other so much, why did you get divorced? Sweetie, these things make me so angry. Let you think about it. Why are you angry? If I loved that woman, I wouldn't let her go. - I think she left you. - Who said that? You are. One night, you told me that while you were crying on my shoulder, my dear. I didn't expect you to use that against me, my dear. You are exaggerating too much In your saying I'm on the verge of losing my mind out of anger. You'd see bread and say, "She was eating bread, too." You would see the milk and say, "It was the milk, too." Guzin was making yogurt. She didn't believe in artificial milk, she made it herself, shaking it with her jerk. - What a woman! - A strange woman! Was she producing milk too? No, she was using goat's milk, she was making excellent yogurt. She was good at solving riddles, my dear. I swear to you. She resolved them very quickly, even the big ones. One day, my dear, I got stuck in a riddle of "Tibetan cow" or "Tibetan cattle"? I thought about it, and from there I cried: “Al-Qattas.” Then we laughed so hard, just ignore her, it's Gozen. She trembles when she becomes obsessed with something. Also tell her about how you idiot met. Stop talking about your ex-wife, she always makes the same mistake. Well my dear, you are right. I what I say? I'm sorry, Goosen. I should have closed my mouth and topped these tomatoes. One, two, three, four, five, six... Did I count them? Darling Listen, this one, hand me the remote control. over there What is the matter "Listen, this one. Hand me the remote control"? What happened to phrases like, "Would you take me the remote control?" Hand me the remote, dude. You are already developing yourself. Hey shouted You, too. You were gradually losing your mind, but now you have shortened the stages. I lost it at once. I've become so rude. Why do you say that? After we had sex for the third time, I'm completely gone About being nice and so on. I don't remember having any sex the third time. Don't think about the bronze medal, it's not like that. We finished third because there were no other contenders. Shame on you! We're close to 30 minutes now. But is your position motivating? No, it is not stimulating. In our last attempt, we could have improved the period, If only that idiot Ertan hadn't interrupted his call. By the way, I'm curious about something. During that time, how did you get to talk about horse racing? I put the phone here. If one's hands are empty... Shall we call it 'four-legged dullness'? He was drunk that night, so what? You are supposed to be an educated person. Do you think horse racing is right for you? No, I read poems with horses as well. Read the poem "Neighing of Brave Horses" to her and she loves it. I think reading poetry on horses Better than 'Ertan' authentication. Don't change the subject As soon as the phone rang that day, I was starting to get angry, as if I had called myself. And before I can say, "Hello, how are you?" You started snoring. - Why did you answer the call? - I was curious when it kept ringing. Does the phone ring continuously? At that hour, every phone was ringing incessantly. I think you know why I hate Ertan so much. What is your concern if he is a womanizer? Womanizer Is he a womanizer? I exclude all honorable female citizens from the eastern block. That man slept with all the dishonest. These are all allegations and fabrications. this is not true Why are you defending Ertan so fiercely? Do you have anything in common? Like Russian literature? I swear I knew things would get here. And here we are. You are always together. Do you read mothers of Russian literature While Ertan is enjoying himself in the next room? - “The orchard of the absurd.” - The slanders continue. Dear Are you doing what Ertan does? And what does he do? I began to answer my questions with questions like all men do. To which question did you answer a question? Still asking questions. any question? And what answer? I got stuck Do you think it is possible to get a reasonable answer from me - How do you ask questions? - Another question. - Honey, will you calm down? - I can't. I can't calm down. Because I would go crazy over something so simple and stupid. - Are you crazy? - Don't ask me questions. - What should I do? - Use another way of questioning. What can I do other than ask questions? - Don't ask any questions! - What else can I do? - Don't just ask questions! - You... Where are you going? - Far away from your questions! - Where are you going? - Don't ask. - You can't tell me where you're going. did not Look what we're in! Was it because of the remote control? "Don't ask questions," she says. I missed the match. "(Susanna Tamaro) Follow your heart" I read the same paragraph a third time, you idiot. "There was a bear tree where I spent my childhood..." Honey, I found out something very exciting about you. - And what is it? - Like all men, After breakfast she goes to the bathroom with a newspaper. But you are different from them. They read it, while you spoil it, my dear. You sometimes say stupid things that are impossible not to be impressed by! Do you have any sense, my dear? If you have, what is it? I read here. Sorry for bothering you Follow Your Heart, a journey that is now in its 14th month. The author has written her second book, and I think you should stop. But I understand you. After all, you are putting in a lot of effort. You have struggled and tried... and you could not have done better. Sometimes you forget this book in the bathroom for days. He lived in a humid environment. If you look closely, you will see that his leaves are too fluffy. And every page is wrinkled. Because our principle is to read one page a day. Are you saying that Berhan is rude? The one who left his wet clothes on my book is not at all wrong? Of course, this is Berhan's fault. Darling Word Editing? Let me say it like this: When we first met, I have noticed that there are indications that there are some cultural differences between us. Cultural differences? What is that? New book? A book you left somewhere and forgot to read? If it was written by Kafka, then no, thanks. His books are very complex. No. I didn't mean that. I think the problem is You are not romantic enough. Why? what did you do The night before, I lit a lot of candles here. - Then? - Big and small, fragrant and ordinary... Create a romantic atmosphere, so you come and say: "Do you have a ritual, my dear?" okay. That was funny. - I don't think it was. - Seriously, why weren't you laughing? That was great. - You don't remember yet, do you? - Remember what? It was our anniversary yesterday. Oh cute! Why didn't you tell me that? You forgot about it in such a wonderful way that I couldn't tell you. You... last night... wait wait Not our wedding anniversary. It is a memory of the day we met. I thought it was important. What is that The day we met, the day we made love... We don't have to celebrate our love making day. did not? We can have a short party. Honey, the bad news is... I don't see you being funny anymore. Shaking? It's like smartphones now. I don't vibrate anymore, I just make a musical tinkle. There are oak trees in the mountains Wherever she went (Camel) Gosh Three days passed..." - Where are you, my dear? - In the bathroom. Between the bathtub and sink. in front of the toilet. I stand up and do my job. Honey, don't forget the toilet cover... Well, I raised it. to late Honey, don't forget to pour water. Well, I'll pour water. - Honey, don't forget your hands. - All right! I will wash them! I hope the floor is still dry. Are you crazy, my dear? Because of this, I no longer use water when I shower. When the floor is wet, the most disgusting thing happens to me. And you know that, that's where my socks get wet. If one wants to bathe properly, He should not marry. To prevent water from splashing, close the shower curtain tightly, I almost suffocated inside. It's interesting that you struggle so much while cleaning yourself. But you realized that soap burns the eyes After our relationship began. wait wait You mean I'm dirty? - Is that it? - I didn't mean it. But your family doesn't care about personal hygiene. مت؟؟؟؟؟؟ ق ق ق ق You know very well who I am talking about. I do not know. who? Listen. I bet Uncle Shamoran was wearing his socks For at least 17 days! but why? Why would someone want to walk in dirty socks? Take it, my dear: Nobody in this world More hateful than your aunt. What was her name? Tobiran? Aunt Toberic. Have you corrected her name for me now? - Aunt Tobiker. - Not tobiker, but toberik. I give up. Can't remember her name. But I am a civilized woman and I will not talk about this issue. - What question? - That matter. - What question? - Well, I'll talk about it. Remember what your uncle did while we were watching TV? - What? - You know what. - What did he do? - He farted. - I heard that. - But didn't it feel weird? He is an old and sick man. So what?
