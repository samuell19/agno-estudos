Our tax dollars at work. Excuse me. That's a high security area. We're N.S.A., hon. - Who are you? - Um, my name's Barbara White. Ah, right. Animal psychologist. A temporary employee. - Well, yes, but I-- Freelance pet-shrinker? Great. That's okay, pal. They're just a couple of federal creeps. Son of a bitch changed the code. Okay, Einstein. Let's try this again. "A", "A". This is "A". "B". "B". This is "B". Bingo. Christ, it must be 120 degrees in here. It keeps its metabolic rate stable. Is that it? Uh-huh. AE-74. Jesus. Carolyn! Carolyn! "Y". This is "Y". "Z". This is "Z". Okay, Einstein. Okay. Okay. Okay, it's time for your test. Okay. Okay, boy. All right? Watch. It's simple. Right? Einstein, give it back! Give it back! Einstein, no! Can't teach an old dog new tricks, can you? Do you ever get tired of running him through the I.Q. test every day? He shows some promise now and then. What is so great about intelligent animals anyway? Because the smarter you are, the worse everything looks. The world must be a beautiful place for you, Melvin. Oh, you're just not very smart, are you? But you sure are sweet. Thank you, Barbara. - Barbara, hi. - Oh, hi, Steve. Did you work through lunch again? That's bad for your health. I'll tell you what. I know a terrific Italian place over in Palm Springs. - Want to check it out with me tomorrow? - Uh, yeah. Sure. That'd be great. So, what's with Dr. I.Q. here? I don't know. He's been acting kind of weird since those N.S.A. people came by here. N.S.A.? You mean, like National Security Agency? - Well, that's what they said. - Oh, my. - But they're gone, aren't they? - No. Actually, I think-- I think they're still down in the basement. Oh, shit! Morons. This is Dr. Maleno. I need to speak to Dr. Glatman immediately. Doris. Steve Maleno. I'm in my lab over at Anodyne. Listen, a couple of N.S.A. snoops... showed up unexpectedly, unannounced, and they, uh-- Oh, yeah, they found the AE-74 all right. Afraid we've got quite a mess on our hands here. All right. I'll wait for you. This was not necessary! You should not have done this! What are you doing to it? Installing a tracking device. Don't bother, Steve. Aesop Project is terminated. All experimental subjects are to be destroyed. Including 74? Especially 74. I hope you know what you're throwing away. 74 is one of the greatest achievements in the history of genetic science. It's a fantastic success! At what? Killing bureaucrats? 74 has been a problem from the start. Its eyes can't handle normal light. Its metabolism is so delicate that it has to be kept in this sauna. Don't you understand? We have created a new intelligent life-form here! Steve! It's uncontrollable. You know that as well as I do! I can control it! You can't! I'm sorry. It must be destroyed. The boys in Washington will handle the rest of the cover-up. And what happens to me? You'll be reassigned. More recombinant D.N.A. work in Oregon... with bacteria. I understand. I'm glad you're taking this so well, Steve. Well, what choice do I have? There's really no alternative. Am I correct? Yes. No alternative. You're the one who called? That's the entry code for the side door. Any entrance after hours will trigger an alarm. You have seven minutes before the police arrive. You understand? Yeah. All right. This card will get you everywhere you need to go. All of the lab animals are on this floor, end of the hall. - Just stay out of the lower level. - Why? Radioactive materials down there. It's very dangerous. Why are you doing this? I love furry little creatures, all right? It's my business. Just let it go at that. Okay. Okay. Anyway you want it. Yeah, thanks... I guess. Come on. Bring the stuff! Let's move! Let's go! All right. All right. Guys, we got seven minutes. Follow me. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! - No, guys. Wait. Don't go down there! - Hey! Let's move it! All right. Don't worry. I'm gonna take you someplace safe and get you out of here. I won't let them get to you. - What the hell are you doing here? - He's got a gun! No, you don't understand! Oh, for-- What was that? Hey, guys! Get out of here! What are you doing? What are you doing? You have to see this. It's looks like some kind of giant baboon. I don't think so. What did they do to it? Hold it! Hold it right there! Oh, no! No more! I told you to stay out of the basement. Hey. Why don't you take these off. I'm not gonna jump. Can't do that-- procedure. Don't worry, Ferguson. The stockade you're going to ain't so bad. It's a minimum-security. They got Ping-Pong, video games, color TV. Sounds better than the barracks. What'd you do anyway? - Struck a superior officer. - Whew. Smart move. Get at least six months for that. What can I tell ya? Guy was an asshole. Can't go sluggin' every asshole in the marines. You won't have any knuckles left. Look out. Dog in the road. Hey. Two points. Hey! Hey, come one. - What are you doin'? - Come on! Let go! Dumb bastard. It was just a dog. You're gonna get a couple of more years in the stir for this. Better see if he's okay. What was that? There's something out there. What the hell? Let's find out. Hey, buddy. Wake up. Come on! Hey, soldier! Wake up! Come on! Get up! What was that thing back there, huh? What was it? Look at me. I'm talkin' to a golden retriever. No collar, huh? What, you run away from a circus or something? Who taught you those tricks? Just a dog. Okay, soldier, let's go. I'm not lookin' forward to this. Yeah? Who is it? It's me. Paul? It's 4:00 in the morning. Come on, Sarah! Let me in! So, they didn't have a jail, huh? Sort of. The dog? You have a dog? You haven't changed much, have you? - Get off the furniture! - Sarah, who is it? Nobody. I'll be right up. Look. It's really nice of you to just drop by like this. - But you can't stay, you know? - Company, huh? Yeah, well, I-- I slept alone enough when I was married to you. We're not gonna have this conversation again, are we, Sarah? If I had any other place to-- Look. Something happened tonight-- something I don't understand. I need your help just for this evening. And I swear you'll never see me again, okay? What are you up to, Paul? You didn't break out, did you? You some kind of fugitive now? It was an accident. It doesn't make sense. That thing, it was like it was after us. - It killed them. - Paul, you're not making sense. Oh, I'm sorry. Look, why don't you just... go on up back to bed? - I'll get you a blanket. - Uh, don't bother about that. Why don't you get the dog some water, okay? Sarah, come on up! I'm coming! If you're thirsty, the toilet's open, okay? Okay, that's it. You need some help? Uh, my name's Barbara White. I, uh-- I work here. Not anymore. There's been a fire. Oh, my God! Place is gutted. Some animal rights freaks broke in last night and torched it. - Was anyone hurt? - It's too early to tell. We're gonna be shiftin' through this rubble for days. But what about the animals? Are they all right? Well, we're figurin' they all just ran away. Oh. Listen. Why don't you just go on home. San Bernardino Police. Are you Sarah Ferguson? No. Sarah McIntyre. - But you are married to Paul Ferguson. - We're separated. Are you aware that your ex-husband escaped from military custody last night? Oh, my God. Do you think he might come after me? We know he's dangerous, ma'am-- two men are dead. We need to talk to him though. You mind if we have a look around? - Yes, I do. You have a warrant? Thanks, Miss McIntyre. We'll be back. Not my style. Mike's a snappy dresser. And I thought I was gettin' sick of camouflage. Paul, what happened to those men last night? Did you tell the cops I was here? Yeah. I told 'em you were upstairs givin' a fashion show to a cute little dog. The truth, Paul. I want the truth! I don't know what happened. Some thing came out of the dark, something that wasn't human. Oh, for Christ's sake! I don't know what happened. It was like a bad dream. Sarah-- You've gotta believe me. So, what are you gonna do now? I don't know. Lay low for a while till things... work themselves out, or... turn myself in. Then again, I hear Rio's a beautiful city. It's good to see you again, Sarah. Would you get outta here? Ooh, cherry lips! ? Cherry lips, cherry lips Tell me, tell me do ? She's headin' out. We'll tail her. ? How do I, how do I ? 10-4, 1-16. ? How do I rate with you ? So, what is it with this dog? He seems to like me. It's great of you to do this for me, Sarah. Thank you. Hell, I always hated this goddamn boat of yours. It's about time I got it out of my garage. No, I mean thanks for all of it. - For believing me. - ? Cherry lips, cherry lips ? ? Whisper loud and clear ?? What the hell? Get outta here! Man's best friend, my ass. It's so funny-- He's in my aerobics class. ? Ooh ? ? Cherry lips, cherry lips Whisper in my ear ? ? Cherry lips, cherry lips Whisper loud ? ? And clear ? ? Pure as rain Red as wine ? ? Sweet as grapes hanging off the vine ? ? Cherry lips, cherry lips Say that you'll be mine ?? Hey. Hey, you! That's a nice car! It's a '63 Chevy, uh, S.S., eh? Yeah. It's in good condition. How much you want for it? Even trade. Okay. Uh, this is the S.P.C.A. Would you mind speaking up a little? They're working on the apartment here. Could hold it down for a minute while I'm on the phone? Thank you. Uh, sorry. I'm trying to track down a-- a missing dog-- a golden retriever. Yes, he was-- he was lost in the desert outside of Palm Springs. Stay low. The stolen jeep was found less than a mile from here. Next thing you know, his car is gone. Mighty big coincidence, don't you think? I'll say. So, why didn't you catch whoever stole it? - You were following me for Christ's sake! - Mrs. McIntyre-- At least you could've made yourself useful! - Miss McIntyre. Please try to understand. We believe this man's a killer. Potentially psychotic. Don't I know it. I married the guy. Look, fellas, if he shows up, you'll be the first to know about it, okay? Believe me, he's the last person on this planet I want to see right now. - All right, then. - Good night, Miss McIntyre. Good night. Oh, Paul. Connect me with Colonel Reynolds, C.I.D. Hello, Colonel? It's, uh, about the Paul Ferguson case. He's ready to give himself up. Hello. Hello? You stupid dog. You just hung up on a colonel. Yeah. I was speaking to Colonel Reynolds. Hey! You wanna spend the night in the bathtub? Now cut that out! No. You can't possibly understand what I'm sayin'. Yeah. Uh, Pizza Express? I'd like to order a large pizza to go... with, um, onions and, uh, green peppers and, uh, pineapple. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Hold it. Hold it. You'd better make that, uh, sausage and, uh, pepperoni... and ground beef and, uh, Canadian bacon. Right. Meat all the way. Uh-- Uh, deliver it to the, uh, Star Motel, room nine. That's not possible. Well, okay. You're so goddamn smart. You tell me. What is my next move? Do you want me to call somebody? Anybody in particular? You want me to call a pillow store? You want me to take a bath? Uh-- O-Okay. Wait, wait wait. All right. I have before me six objects. What do they all have in common? Uh, they're all found... in a cheesy motel room? I don't know. Okay. Um-- They're all, uh, fairly ordinary? No, don't tell me. Uh, they're all, uh, white? They're all white? You want me to call somebody named White? Maybe I ought to call the men in white suits. There seems to be about two or three hundred Whites here. You want me to call them all? Ah. I'll read 'em to you. "White, 'A'. "White, Aaron. White, Albert. White, Alan. "White, 'B'. White, 'B'. White, Barbara." White, Barbara? On San Pedro? All right. All right. One bark for yes. Two barks for no. You got it? You want me to call Barbara White? Why? All right. Sorry. Come on, Paul. This is crazy. Well-- All right already. If it means so goddamn much to ya. It's ringing. Hello. Yeah, uh, hi. I'd like to speak to Barbara White, please. This is she. Oh, hi. Um-- This is gonna sound a little strange, but, uh, my dog asked me to call you. What, is this some kind of joke? Uh, listen. I've got this, uh, smart-ass... golden retriever, and he... indicated that I should give you a call. Wait. You have Einstein? Huh? "Einstein"? I hear him! Are you one of those animal people? Wait a minute? Are you telling me... this is your dog? Look. Check in his right ear. There should be a tiny tattoo with the letters A-E. Read me the rest of it. "7-3." Yes! Yes. Yeah. I guess he is your dog. Okay. Well, uh, can I come and pick him up? Yeah, sure. I'll, uh-- I'll tell you how to get here. Or, uh, I could bring him out to you. I can come out tomorrow morning. Or, uh, how about tonight? Great, great. Tonight's great. Uh, my address is 600-- Wait. Wait. - 600 South Main, unit-- - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, it'll take me a while. I guess I'll see ya in a couple of hours. Fine, Uh, see you soon. Thank you. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. What just happened? Yeah. Who is it? You ordered a pizza. $14.99. So, Einstein, you wanna pay for it? Paul? Is that you? Paul? Huh? An hour later, you still wish you hadn't eaten it. Oh, I'll get you some doughnuts tomorrow. Okay. Lights out. Eh, no free show tonight? Shit! What the hell was that? Miss McIntyre? Miss McIntyre, you okay? In here, Bill. Oh, God. We need you to clear this area. - Get away from the police unit. Folks, we need to get the area clear! Coming through here. Let the paramedics through, please. Coming through, please. Hey, Officer, did somebody get killed? But your sign says there's vacancies. Sign's busted. We're full up. Sorry, kid. Hey. Checkin' out. Hey, you just got here! Didn't you like the "dee-core"? You're in luck. Hey, no pets! - You gotta pay extra for pets! - Send me a bill. What was that? It was nothin'. Are you sure? Let me take a look. What the hell? Would you quiet down in there! There's people tryin' to sleep! Fuckin' kids! I know. I'm sorry too. Come on. Come with me! Come on. Come on. I'm taking you someplace safe. I won't let anyone hurt you. Come on. Come to me. You can do it. Come on! Come to me! Hey, nice doggy! Got a quarter? Okay. Hop down. - Hello? - Yeah. Hi. I'm the guy that found your dog. Hey, Einstein! Uh, come on up. It's the top floor. After you. Hey, Einstein! Oh, Einstein! I missed you so much! I was so worried about you. Nice dog. Uh, well, it's, uh-- It's late. I'll guess I'll be gettin' on back. Well, um, won't you come in for a minute, and, uh, have somethin' to drink? Oh, no. No, thanks, I-- I got things to do. Oh. Well, uh, thank you so much. Yeah. Well, take care of him, okay? He's, uh-- He's a real special guy. And I guess you know that. - Hey. - Einstein. - Let go of me. - Einstein. Any kind of soda would be great. Einstein, what's gotten into you? I'm sorry. Uh-- Um, I'm Barbara. Barbara White. Oh. Oh, hi. I'm Paul... Paul. Uh, pleased to meet you, Paul Paul. Uh, well, come in. Please, have a seat. Thanks. It's, uh-- It's a nice space you got here. Oh, sorry about the mess. It's being remodeled. How did you find me? Actually, I didn't. He did. Um, am I missing something? Well, he's a very intelligent animal. Thanks. Good evening. At the top of our news, three more brutal murders rocked the Southland this evening... bringing the total to five in two days. The third victim was 28-year-old... Sarah McIntyre Ferguson of San Bernardino, the estranged wife of marine captain Paul Ferguson. Ferguson is being sought for questioning. He is still at large. Ferguson was also identified as having been present... at the Star Motel in Upland... where the bodies of a young man and woman, as yet unidentified, were discovered just minutes ago. The killer appears to be working his way west towards Los Angeles. Anyone with any information as to Paul Ferguson's whereabouts... is urged to contact police. Turning to national news now. Einstein! - Einstein, no! - Einstein. Let her go. Oh, my God. Did you teach him to do that? Teach him? Didn't you? "Paul no killer." That thing in the desert, what was it? "Outsider." This is just too weird. What's Outsider? Why? Why'd he kill Sarah? Why's he following me? It worked! I don't believe it. It worked. The Aesop Project worked. This is a miracle. What worked? They-- They were trying to breed super-intelligent animals... to genetically engineer them actually. Who? Anodyne, the place I used to work. But we all thought that-- that Einstein was just... ordinary. Or maybe he just didn't like being treated as an experiment, huh? You've been playing dumb all along? One bark for "yes," two for "no." Jesus Christ! Outsider. The Outsider killed all those people? You know what it is? It's-- I heard about it at Anodyne. There was always lots of rumors. About what? About a black project. You know, a top-secret thing. I didn't have the security clearance, and no one I worked with knew what the Outsider was, or even if it was real. It is real. I saw it. Shh. I know. I know. They shot you, didn't they? And you ignore the pain. Perfect. What were you doing? Where the hell did you think you were going? Better to be calm, isn't it? There. There. You've reached the home of Dr. Steven Maleno. Please leave a message. Steve, it's Barbara White. You won't believe this. I have Einstein. The experiments worked. He's smart. He can communicate. Barbara, what the hell are you talking about? Where did you find him? What? The Outsider experiment. No. No, no, no. That was just some paranoid stories. Where the hell did you get that idea? No, of course not. That's absurd. We didn't create a-a-a killing machine. Why do you ask? Listen. How fast can you get the dog out here? I need to see it. I'd, uh-- I'd come there, but I'm, uh-- I'm running an experiment that requires constant supervision. Okay. Of course. You were after the dog. You still want the dog. Well, after all, that's what it was meant to be. You are genetically linked. Brothers. You don't have to go, Einstein. This has all been a little much for me. I could use a drink. How 'bout you? Sure. Come on. What's the matter? I'm sorry. It's just beginning to sink in-- Sarah. I can't believe she's dead. This couch is pretty comfy. And you're welcome to stay over. Why are you doing this for me? You don't know anything about me, except that I'm wanted by the police. It's strange, but, uh, I trust the dog. Guess I just have a thing for strays. Good night. We were on a training exercise. Advanced guerrilla tactics. There was this colonel, a real R.E.M.F. - R.E.M.F.? - A rear echelon motherfucker. He sent us out with the wrong coordinates, and we wound up in the middle of a live artillery barrage. One of my men lost both his legs before I could contact fire base. On a goddamn training exercise. Shh. I know. I know. The dog is on the way. But I am going to teach you two to work together, the way you were meant to. You shouldn't hate the dog. The dog is part of you. No. No. Please! I created you! No! Relax, pal. We're almost there. I'm afraid that's the problem. I know, pal. You stay here if you want. We gotta go do this. Well, that's funny. His car's here, but he said he couldn't leave the house. Steve? Steve? I don't think there's anybody home. What are we looking for? Anything to do with the Aesop Project. Paul, I think this might be it. Paul, no! Come on! Come on! Never mind who this is. The thing that killed those people... is loose in the Angeles Crest above Red Box Canyon. Yeah-- Listen-- Listen to me! You gotta get all the manpower you can together up there to stop it-- You-- What'd they say? You try telling the cops there's a monster on the loose. Hey, get away from there! - How much is that? - Thirty even. Thirty dollars? It's okay. Shouldn't bring animals in here. You know. No kidding. Not at these prices. What's this? Anodyne. It must be Steve's. It's a tracking device. We use these in the military. What's he tracking? The Outsider. AE-73 was the first of Anodyne's Aesop experiments-- Oh, look, Einstein. It's you. Splicing the genetic material of mammals and humans. Look how little and cute he is. At first, it learned faster than a human infant. Although at six months, the learning curve tailed off, the results bode well for future advancements, given sufficient funding. In our latest development, a rudimentary psychic bond has formed... between AE-73... and the Aesop project's major breakthrough AE-74. It's a promo tape. I've seen a lot of these. Everybody's gotta sell their weapons. AE-73 and 74 are Anodyne's first steps... towards biomedical means of infiltration and elimination. The canine 73s will perform efficient, undetected espionage... discovering enemy command posts. The 74s, nonhuman assassins, will be capable of tracking the 73s... empathically moving in and neutralizing enemy command personnel. It may sound like science fiction, but the age of selective genetic breeding has arrived. The future looks bright. I would disagree. Dog spies and monster assassins? This is completely insane. Yeah, but you get used to this sort of thing in the military. Relax, pal. Your brother is still way out of range. Yeah, but this thing is fast. It covered this much ground in two nights. It got from here to here. Maleno must have picked it up. It could be in the city as early as tomorrow. And this time I'm gonna be ready for it. I know where you can get all the things I'll need. I'd do the shopping myself, but a gun store's a bad place for a fugitive to be seen. - A gun store? - I'll have to go with an MP5. I can modify that. And a couple of shotguns. Good, fast weapons. Ammo, primer, combat knife, black powder, caps. Paul-- Paul, this is nuts. I can't-- I can't go in and buy that. What's wrong? Don't you have a credit card? Well, yeah. It's just that they don't just let... anybody walk in off the street and buy that kind of stuff, do they? You'd be surprised. This is America. Besides, too late to do anything else, even if I could get those cops to help me. Look. Paul, why don't we just take Einstein and get in the car and go. It's a big world out there. We can find a safe place. Are you offering to run away with me? Well, no, not exactly. I just-- It wouldn't work. They're gonna be looking for me. I'd never be free. And as long as that thing's out there, there is no safe place. Besides, I want it. You want it? I owe Sarah that much. What the fuck is going on, man? Excellent. You're getting the hang of it. Remember, the chamber only holds three rounds, so you're gonna have to make 'em count. They're explosive charges. You hit this thing any place, you ought to blow him in half. Here's some. Thanks. It's good. Here, have a poke, buddy. You sound like you could use it. Hey, give me some. Geez, man. You sick or something? What a nice teddy. ...in the Middle East. In local headlines, scandal in city hall, smog levels reach record highs... and two more savage Southland murders take place in Glendale and in downtown Los Angeles. More after this. Come to Terry's Tire City... for our special 20 % off-- Paul? What are you doing? I'm goin' after it. It's closer than I expected. Its position's stationary. It's time to move. But I thought we were gonna wait for it here together. I can't. It killed two more people last night. I gotta do this. Take care of her for me, will ya? Paul? Come back, okay? ? I'm going all the way ? ? With Jesus ? ? Yes, I am ? ? And I'm gonna ? Hey. Where is this, huh? Where the fuck is this? Planet Earth, man. Take it easy. Let's get out of here. Now you're dead, you motherfucker! Jesus, lady! You can take it. Take it all. - Where'd you get this? - I found it on the street. When? When? I don't know. Uh, uh, uh-- You can keep it. It's real valuable. Jesus. Paul, is that you? Paul? Paul, answer me. Paul, answer me! Steve! My God. You're alive. I knew he'd come here. He wants the dog. You can't kill him. No! What are you doing? That thing will kill us all! It won't kill me. He took my eye, but he spared me. He doesn't wanna be seen. But he felt compassion. Why are you doing this? All he wants is the dog. We just have to give him the dog. Then the killing will stop. Now come on, Barbara. Be reasonable. No! Give me that dog! Barbara, there's no place to hide. Oh, you've been hurt. I wanna help you. Listen. The dog, he's right in there. You can have him. I created you both. I want you to have him. No. No, you can't. I'm-- I'm the only one who-- who cares about you. Go on! Go, boy! Yes! Go, Einstein. No! No! Einstein! No! No! No! Paul! Paul! No! The lights! Hit the lights! Einstein. Stay back.
