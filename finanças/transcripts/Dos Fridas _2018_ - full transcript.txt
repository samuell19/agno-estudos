All the nurses they bring for me, snore! Tell me about your experience, Judith. Is that your name? I studied at the Hospital in Costa Rica and at the Hospital in New York City. I know soviet rehabilitation techniques The girls told me about you... but I would like to know how much do you charge? I also play the guitar and sing corridos. Are you a communist? I am a Scorpio. If I could, I would not charge you. What I want most is to help you. I have to consult my husband. The column is broken in three places, the clavicle and the ribs are fractured. The left shoulder is dislocated the pelvis is broken in three places. Death haunts my bedside. It's empty laughter enfolds me, high-pitched buzzing pierces through the third eye, she wants to enter. She balances fleshless hips, rattling bones, deep jaw. Emptiness. Judy? How are you? Remind me your name. I remember your face, but not your name. We have never met... -I am... - Don't tell me. You survived a terrible accident. A car drove over the sidewalk... I remember you very well. Those rings... did they belong to Frida Kahlo? Don't cry. Did you know what was going on with her? She committed suicide Mi niña was always fooling me, deceiving me... Frida needed a nurse with character who could take charge. And the pain, was it real? The pain she suffered was pain in the centre of pain. The column is the continuation of the brain. Pain is not mirrored there. It's the spasm, the pain in the nerve It was her nerves that hurt. What made you leave? "Death came in and Uvieta... sat Death so she could see the grapevine, which was brimming with delicious grapes. "Careful! You might be tempted to taste it!" Death saw the grapevine, she said: "How beautiful, Uvieta!" And old Uvieta, who was pretending to pack his bag, answered: "Why don't you go up there, comadrita and eat as much as you can?" Death climbed the grapevine. When Uvieta saw Death up there, he burst into laughter at once and shouted "You bit off more than you could chew! 'Stay there until I say otherwise.'" - Shall I stop reading? - No! "Death wanted to come down, but it couldn't. And there it stood and years went by and nobody died. People couldn’t fit on Earth, everywhere the elders roamed like dumbs.’’ Give me the dress you prepared because you did it with love, and in this house, there is no love. You know that love is the only reason to live. It is a downpour that comes Sending great droplets Coming from behind Look, Citlali. Your grandmother Capulina. Good morning, Judith. I dreamt that you abandoned me. And who are you? What are you doing here? But... And your kids? Who is staying with them? -1 don't have kids. You are married, aren't you? Married? No. I still want to do many things. Fortunately! Do what you want, but don't end up alone. Is it wrong to be alone? You can’t guess, who was here last night. No, who? Well, Diego Rivera, the Russian astronaut Yuri Gagarin and my dear friend Carmen Lyra. Why did they come? They brought me this Virgin of Guadalupe. What did you do? Well.. we partied! I'm glad you are happy, Judy. Does it hurt? This changing weather, what a bore. Call the Doctor, ask him for vitamins. Sort the house out, fill it with flowers. From Mexico, I miss the food and its hours. Here in Costa Rica, we live earlier. Don't end up alone... There is nothing wrong with that. Cheers. Judy. Itinga the Mad, erroneously called Judith Ferreto, nurse by profession, artist at heart. Cheers. To the Russian astronaut. Cheers! To the best muralist in Mexico and the most handsome Latin American leader! Cheers to all of you! And for my dear Carmen Lyra... Cheers, my dear. "THANKS TO THE LONELY SOUL FOR SAVING JUDITH FERRETO, FRIDA KAHLO’S NURSE, WHO SUFFERED AN ACCIDENT IN MEXICO IN 1985.” And through a crevice Your blood escaped Of all colours Your blood And it became a river Of all colours The river And on the river, a boat And on that boat you floated away An unfamiliar path Unknown destination For what should we know? For what? No one stains my white uniform! To leave the closet open, brings good luck. If Adelita were to leave with another I would follow her by land and by sea By sea in a warship By land in a military train Popular among the troops was Adelita The woman, that the sergeant idolized And besides being brave... She was pretty Even the Colonel respected her And it was heard That the one Who loved her so much said: If Adelita were to leave with another I would follow her by land and by sea By sea in a warship By land in a military train If Adelita wanted to be my girlfriend If Adelita were my wife I would buy her a silk dress To take her to the barracks and dance And after the cruel battle had ended And the troops returned to the camp The voice of a weeping woman And praying were heard throughout the camp The ability of a nurse is to detect when a sensitive being is in her care and use sensitivity for sake of the patient. We must dig deep into the patient's mind where sometimes can be something that makes their recovery harder. Clothe them well, Take care of them, always be attentive to their needs The nurse take small yet important steps The doctor can't, he doesn't have the time Gradually and meticulously, we need to figure out all the signals they send us. There are mechanisms to stop feeling. Defenses, when one no longer can cope. We are a laboratory and she didn't know about halfway jobs. You wanted to heal, to cheer, to protect... but who protected you? Citlali! Here you are. Come here, beautiful. Did you give Citlali some water? - Yes. "Hegel remarks somewhere that all facts and major figures of great importance to the history of the world occur, as it were, twice. He forgot to add, the first time as a tragedy, the second as a farce." It's a downpour that comes... Death haunts my bedside The empty laughter embraces me, high-pitched buzzing pierces through the third eye. It wants to enter. Don't forget me. I break apart. I disappear. I don't exist. What was Frida's voice like? Like yours. But firmer. I knew by her voice how she was feeling. If a person relies on another to live When I was young I had a boyfriend whom I loved dearly. Then, I had some loves... And were you happy with them? Sometimes. Do you know what love is? What do you know about my life, you fool? Why did you leave Frida alone? Diego told me once: "Judy made la niña feel alive. And when she wasn't here, la niña went away..." I had to leave. I was ill and my mother was dying in Costa Rica. I had to leave... Judith Ferreto. Or... Judith Frida? What I miss most is her tenderness. The tenderness of mi niña Frida and my mother's. Was your mother very strict? Don't forget me. Where are you hiding, you devil? Citlali! Citlali! Citlali? Citlali? Darling! Where are you hiding, you devil? It is hot. It is hot. Is this the English Hospital? May I speak to Frida Kahlo? She is a patient there. This is Judy. Oh Judy, my Judy! Where are you? I phoned at your house and nobody answered I don't know if I can visit you. Oh Judy, my Judy! If you look after me, later the surgery I will let them cut off leg. You will take care of me, won't you? My surgery depends on it. I won’t accept if you don’t take care of me My precious little girl... It is not true that I am right. Yes, you are. I was thinking about it a lot. He always looks at you. He looks at me? Promise you won't leave me the night I die I promise. When will the Veiled Lady arrive? The Catrina. The Chicharrona. The Inevitable Justice Doña Huesos The Timely. The Time of Time. The Time of Truth. The Siriquisiaca. Mrs Skeleton. The Liberator... If Adelita were my wife I would buy her a silk dress To take her to the barracks and dance Do you want me to help you get ready? Which dress do you want to wear? The one you prepared with love... Go slowly, my dear. I don't want to stop you. I’d like you to see, how to balance your duties so you can make the most of it. Do I know you? Judy! Judy! Touch me. Touch me and when you find a soft spot, inject me! Inject me! Go to Hell! Old cunt! Don't fuck me around! Fuck you! Hurry! Go away! Creepy crawly Death, you greedy corpse! You hungry gut! Go away! I am a little deer Living in the mountains And as I am not as calm I do not swim during the day At night little by little Into your arms my love You and I we will cross a place where the wind cuts as obsidian razors. Lord Saint Jerome Sent by God To free the souls That have sinned Lord Saint Jerome Sent by God To free the souls, that have sinned God's soul of God we ask Give us ease for all eternity Lord Saint Jerome Pray to Saint Peter To open the gates and enter to Heaven Would you open the door to Karl Marx? This is your house! Will you open? Who is it? Leon Trotsky. Would you let Julio Antonio Mella in? you were killed too young. Open. Who is it? It's Angelina Beloff. Will you open? It's Jacqueline Lamba. Will you open? Who is calling me? Yuri Gagarin. Will you open the door? I am Antonin Artaud. I will not open. Your feet are not on the ground! Who is shooting at? It's Adelita. Diego Rivera. It's Sigmund Freud. -And Yolanda Oreamuno? To Carmen Lyra? Open up! André Breton. Come in, Mr. Breton. It's Tina Modotti. My dear boy. Would you like some fruit, Chi? The clock is three minutes to midnight. That symbolic clock that measures time... To the end of time. To the end of time? We always need a clock to remember the time. Time of Time, Time of Truth, The key Hour If it is true when we die, life returns as violent recovery of memory Judith. Do you remember me? We both got to Mexico you were my nurse. Carmen Lyra! When I saw those kids going to school, clinging timidly to the walls, they didn’t dare to cross open spaces, as if organs of offset had been torn out, I knew we had to do something else, something more than bathing them or giving them a cup of oatmeal or milk. Return. How can we return? What are you hiding? What are you saying? What are you not saying? The guitar, the sickle and the bandolier The hat, the sickle and the hammer. The guitar, the corn and the bandolier The sickle, the corn and the hammer Not only did I lose my child, I also lost my creative potential. I don't know how to paint, I don't want it Don't you love me anymore, Diego? You are so pale, you look translucent... I can see your heart. I never stopped at street to look a child as the child itself. I always saw them as strokes on paper. I must capture the purity of his chin, the roundness of his little head. His nose, almost always flat. The guitar, the bandolier, the hat... Now everything has changed and I look with sadness at the kids crossing the street to school and they are not drawings, they are kids of flesh and blood. The secret is hold the form in its light Is the precise moment in which light becomes the form. The Earth is blue like an orange it's not a mistake words don't lie. Words don't lie. - From the heights of the cosmos the sky looks dark and the Earth is clear I can see islands, coasts and mountains. I love the Earth of convulsive beauty Its mountains its flora its mix of races... Your eyes of wood, of linen, or of water. Your ballerina walk. To walk and to walk, to walk all day long. Horses are a man's privilege. I care of wounded under a shrapnel shower Nothing is better than a healing wound. We are the Soldaderas, the Adelita, the Cockroach, the Generala, Maria Pistols I would follow her by land and by sea If by sea in a warship If by land in a military train Nothing scares me, neither broken hands, nor blood nor bones And if they kill me again let them kill me right away! Without us, there is no revolution! If there is no way, we will make it. All we do is walk. After we die, we walk. Cheers! Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers! The Girl’s Aunt. The Undesired. Who? in the midst of certain anguishes, at the heart of some dreams, did not know death as a destructive and marvelous sensation that can't be compared to anything... The Pale Death. The Boss. I was lucky enough to have loved Frida, poetry made flesh I couldn't love her as much as I would because of my weakness for women. What do you desire and don't want to say? A Caliph's tooth? A jewel from Queen Victoria's crown? A giant's autograph? For the need to transform the world. For the need to dream. To change life! To act! To walk in the paths of hallucination. - Cheers. So comrades come rally And the last fight let us face The Internationale Unites the human race So comrades come rally And the last fight let us face The Internationale Unites the human race Your heart, burns, exalts, or two deep-welling tears that fall, wrung from your eyes, from the exaltation of the song... The eyes devour all... I play to the raging sea that crashes against the cliff. To blind my eyes, to burn my heart, so my soul gets lost in the depths of Hell Let the dead bury their dead! Let them cry for them. Life is a dream, a frenzy. Have you drunk the poison, love? Trembling, she approaches... It is Death. Flutters in her chest. Stabbed by pain, profoundly, her eyes are shut forever. The Shadow. The Faithful Girlfriend. Remind me your name. I remember your face, but not your name. Inspired by true events
