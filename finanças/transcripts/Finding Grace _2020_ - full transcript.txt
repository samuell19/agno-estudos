(PROJECTOR WHIRRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PEACEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) WOMAN: The fine imposed is $750. How long do you need to pay? Seven... I don't ha... I don't have a job. You have 90 days. You will also take an approved anger management course in the next 30 days. See the clerk on the way out. Hm, uh, Alaska Rose? Do you understand the instructions given at the beginning of this hearing? That would be either a yes or a no. Yeah. Possession of alcohol in public. I didn't do anything. What was that? I didn't even do anything wrong. You pled no contest at the start of these proceedings. Are you now changing your plea? It wasn't even my drink. I was just holding it for somebody else. And I suppose the fake ID found on your person bearing your picture belongs to someone else as well? Miss Rose, you just turned 18. That means, now more than ever, the decisions you make carry lifelong consequences. Now this being your first recorded offense as an adult, I will suspend the 60 days detention in county jail in lieu of 100 hours of community service. 100 hours? That's like my entire life. Let's make that 150. Would you prefer 200? If you get into any trouble during this time, and I mean so much as a speeding ticket, you will serve your time in full. You get this right, and you walk away with a clean slate. You mess up again, and you will go to jail for real, and you will carry with you an adult criminal record for the rest of your life. So ordered. (GAVEL CLACKS) (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) And might I suggest you leave my courtroom while I'm still in a good mood? Just... Wait a minute. I gotta say somethin'. And what was wrong with the last 40 minutes? Alaska. Hey, get back here! (DOOR SLAMS) (DOOR SLAMS) Do you think I'm gonna allow you to continue this disrespect? - The hell did I do now? - Watch the mouth. Sorry, did I say a swear word? You're out of control. You... Are you enjoying this? What are you doing? Grounding you. Grounding me? You're not taking my keys! Don't tell me what I can't do. You will drive to school and you will drive home and that is it. I'm 18 years old! I don't care if you're 35! Everything in this house belongs to me. I need my keys. My house. My rules. My keys. I'm supposed to be somewhere tonight and I need my keys! Stop it, Allie. Just... Just stop it. You are not going anywhere tonight. You are not going anywhere for a long time. - This isn't happening. (CHUCKLES) This is not happening. Do you grasp what is happening? (ALASKA CHUCKLES) You were just arrested, Allie. Arrested! You could be in jail right now which is way different than some little overnight holding cell. You are not going who-knows-where, anymore. Since when do you care where I go? Excuse me? Mom would never do this. Mom would never try and trap me here and freak out like this! Okay, okay. Well, why don't we just give her a call? Oh, that's right, she didn't leave us a phone number. Father of the Year. I'm the bad guy. You get arrested and it all comes back to me! (DOOR SLAMS) Never fails. Lookin' for an idea for that science project? Think you've only got about a week till you have to turn somethin' in, right? I told you already, the Solar System. Oh. Maybe you did. Look, maybe we can work on it this weekend. Can I have some more noodles? I don't think Allie's had any. She's not eating, she never eats here. Oh, yeah? Let me go check on her first. Is she going away, like to prison? (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) No, Allie's not going to prison. Your sister's not a criminal. Allie? (KNOCKS) Allie? ALASKA: Yeah. Are you hungry? Got dinner for you. ALASKA: No, thanks. (CRICKETS CHIRP) What frigging took you so long? Don't even get me started. Is Derek there? Everyone's there and it's really late. I really didn't want to leave. Buckle up! (LAUGHS) (MOODY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (BACKGROUND CHATTER) Alaska girl. There's my favorite Eskimo. Still never lived there. No, you're too hot to live there. Try and melt the whole place down or somethin'. Are you trying to be a dork? So what's this I hear about you getting arrested? It's nothing, I just got caught with a fake ID when I was getting a ride home with some college girls. Oh, those college girls. They're a bad influence, aren't they? Maybe. You wanna go upstairs? It's all cool, we'll go in one of the rooms. I kinda just got here. Do you wanna take a walk instead? Sure. (BIRDS CHIRP) Yes? Oh, it'll be a few minutes, I need to call Miss Wheeler. Is this our new help? Alaska, is it? They call me Allie. Well, I'm Amanda Wheeler, I kind of oversee things here. And you've already met Ben. He pretty much does everything we need. Helps us a lot. Okay, you wanna come with me, and I'll give you the brief tour? Can I have my paper back? Ben can make a copy of it for you and give it back to you when you're done. Come on. So, this is one of our dining halls. Pretty empty right now, but at dinner time in a couple of hours, it'll be very busy. Of course, some of our residents eat in their rooms, but it is a good time to socialize. A lot of them love getting together around dinner. We have games, too, even dancing. The festivities can get a bit out of hand some evenings. This way. Through that door is our medical wing, limited on-site emergency services and some outpatient stuff. Oh, physical therapy, of course, too. And through here. This is our terrace. Quite popular with the residents. They can enjoy the view, listen to music. Or they can just move around, get some fresh air. Out there, we have our deck area, probably the favorite. Residents can go out there if they're mobile but they're usually accompanied by family. They even have fishing off the deck, once a week. Have any questions so far? Yeah. What am I supposed to be doing everyday? That's our final stop. Here we are. (KNOCKS) Mrs. Foster? It's Amanda. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I brought a friend. Her name's Alaska, isn't that cute? Only two kinds of girls chew gum in public like that. And both of them don't belong in a wholesome place like this. Now that's not very welcoming, Mrs. Foster. She likes to go by Allie. She's the one I told you about. The one who's gonna be spending some time with you? She's very nice. I'll be back in a bit. Wait. I'm the one who's signing off on your community service papers. Would you rather that time be in jail? You two have fun. (MRS. FOSTER LAUGHS) What are you laughing at? We're both in jail. Hilarious. (MRS. FOSTER CHUCKLES) "Alaska." What kind of name is that anyway? Sounds like a name from a hippy commune. You grow up on a commune? I don't know what that is. (CHUCKLES) Oh, Lord. And you're supposed to be here for conversation? No, actually, I'm not here for conversation. I don't even know why I'm here. Don't know why you're here? You're here because you messed up. You've gotta be smart enough to know that, at least. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Who said you could touch anything? Excuse me. You come in here and put your grimy hands all over things. You tried to lift my stuff. I was just looking at it. What'd you steal to get stuck in here, huh? I didn't steal anything, you're crazy! AMANDA: Is everything all right? MRS. FOSTER: Get out this room! Send me to jail. And stay out! What kinda place are you running here? AMANDA: It's okay, it's done. Letting hoodlums in our rooms. What's next, you gonna let the gangs in? It's okay, Mrs. Foster, it's my fault. I thought it would help. MRS FOSTER: I'm not crazy. AMANDA: I know you're not. But you know it's not good for you to get upset. You need to calm down. MRS. FOSTER: I know. It's gonna be okay. You've already had a long day. Maybe you just need some rest. You tell her... I'm not crazy. Wasn't the best idea, I guess. We'll get you started in the kitchen. What's, um, wrong with her? Nothing more than some of our other residents. Through here. (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) I was really supposed to be out of here like an hour ago. Where's Allie? Dude. Do you know how many times you've asked me that? I have no idea. That's it for our two PM? It was a, like, a spazzy guy with them. I don't know, they booked three. MR. ROSE: They booked? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, when they called this morning, and I jotted it down. MR. ROSE: I told you if it's less than four, you gotta move them to the next tour or cancel if it's early enough. Can I show you something? All right, boom, boom, boom. What next one, man? Hey, you care if I take off? I'm fine, thanks, Ron. And I get the extra hour? - (CHUCKLES) Yes. - All right. See ya tomorrow. (PHONE RINGS) Yeah, Dad? MR. ROSE: Where are you? Driving. MR. ROSE: Why aren't you at work? I'm going to that place. MR. ROSE: What place? The nursing home? Whatever it is. Okay well did you forget that you were scheduled for noon? ALASKA: I have to pay my debt to society. I have like months to go in that place. That's all well and good, but who said that was gonna interfere with our livelihood? Dad, please. What, do you have like two people there? No. No! And what does that have to do with your schedule anyway? What do you want me to do? Be responsible. (SIGHS) Okay, just... Be careful. - See you tonight. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey, uh, Conner? - Yeah. - It's Bryan, Shaw. Of church. Sorry to drop in on you guys like this. That's okay. BRYAN: Is it a bad time? No, but uh, we just got back from the sitter's, and now we're sittin' down for dinner and homework. I understand, I should've called. I could've called. Have we met? Well, not directly, but my wife visited a couple times, when the kids were younger? Okay, what can I do for you, man? Well, it's gonna sound crazy, and it is kinda crazy, 'cause I don't normally do stuff like this. I was at church this weekend, we haven't seen you guys for like the longest time. I just got this feeling. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SIGHS) Anything we can do for you? No, but um... Thanks for coming out, really. Sure. Well, maybe we'll see you Sunday. Maybe. Awesome, well, you guys have a good night. (CONNER SIGHS) Dad, what's wrong? Nothin' at all. (BELL RINGS) (HORN HONKS) (ALASKA CHUCKLES) What's your problem? You didn't answer your phone. I didn't have my phone on in class. What're you doing later? I have to go that place. Wanna get all my hours in before summer. Not cool. Also not forever. True. Maybe I gotta come there. I mean, I'm sure you get breaks, right? Maybe. (HORN HONKS) See you later, babe. Call me. You're late. Again. I do have school, you know. This isn't like a real job or anything. Well... It is, for us. All right, I'm making the rounds. You know, Mrs. Foster was asking about you. That's great. Yeah, you wanna bring hers, maybe say hi? She never leaves her room. I'll pass, she's probably just wondering if I'm gone yet. Oh, well, I'll let her know that you're not, and that you're busy down here. - Hi, Jimmy. - Hey, there. So, Allie, I thought of something you could help us with. Did I do something wrong? No, no no no, you're fine. So, the semi-annual talent show is coming up, and I'd like for you to be involved. I mean, I was gonna ask you. Talent show? Mm-hm. You're serious? Yes, I am, actually. I started it four years ago when I first got here. Okay? Anyway, so the last couple of times have been, I would say not as successful as they could have been. I was hoping that with somebody new and trendy, that it would be good for the program. "Trendy?" You know what I mean. So I was hoping you could start tomorrow? I don't know. I'm not sure this facility would keep running, if I wasn't here to pass out green jello. I'll see you tomorrow. (VIDEO GAME MUSIC) Dad's not here? He said he couldn't wait anymore. It's only five minutes after. Does Dad know you're on the game? I don't know. Do you have any homework? I don't know. How about we play one game, and then look at what you have for homework? Even when you always get totally owned? Co-op, Kyle. Same team, please. Okay, deal. (ALASKA CHUCKLES) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (GUNS FIRE) What, Allie, don't stop, what're you doing? I'm not stopping. I don't know what's happening, I - got stuck. - Turn it, hurry! Get 'em off me, get them off... What do you think I'm doing? Shoot 'em, shoot! Go, go, go, go! You got it! I win! We did it. Awesome. All right. Oh, my gosh, that is not the right time. Kyle, it was supposed to be one game, come on. I don't have any homework tonight! I will straight up murder you. I don't! My science project was due, but I'm gonna take the zero. What do you mean? You've been talking about that project forever. Yeah, we talked about it but we never started it. And now it's due tomorrow? I won't fail. What's it on? Let me see it. I wanted to do the Solar System. We never got anything for it. Come on. (WARM MUSIC) Come on! Allie. Did Mom ever help you with homework and stuff, like tonight? Yeah, yeah, she, she was always there to help with that kind of stuff when I was little. I mean, when I was in middle-school, I never really asked for it, even though I wanted it. And Dad helped too, I mean, he just worked a lot. She used to always use this thing, though, where she'd make me try everything alone first, before she'd help. And it was so frustrating. But looking back, it was probably the biggest help of all. Why did she leave? (MELANCHOLY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You know, bud... That's something you're gonna have to ask her. (CHUCKLES) If you ever get the chance one day. I try not to worry about it anymore. Maybe you should try that too. Thanks for helping me. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (UPBEAT MUSIC) FRIEND: Oh, you got gummies? I didn't even see the gummies. Here. (CHUCKLES) You sure? Yeah, I got too much of everything. Thanks. Aren't you grounded? Yeah. I just needed a break. You're not finished with those hours yet? I just barely started 'em. Peace. I know it's a sensitive subject. It's messed up. I mean, I constantly feel like I'm at a funeral home. That judge must really hate me. I bet she doesn't have any kids. Oh, I missed the chocolate chunks too? And the boss lady? Worse than my dad. It's like I'm the only person working there, and I'm not even getting paid. Dude. And to top it all off, she has me doing this stupid talent show. (FRIEND CHUCKLES) Are you serious? That's what I said, and then she was all like, "Oh yeah, I'm a genius and I started the whole thing," and I was like, "Okay?" (FRIEND GIGGLES) Sounds like fun, though. Maybe you'll find the next American Idol. (GIGGLES) Exactly. So? Are you gonna be able to get out Friday night? Probably, I'm working on it. Derek really wants to see you. (CHUCKLES) He thinks you've been avoiding him. I haven't been avoiding him, I have work. You know that, I mean, he knows that. I'm just telling you what he says. And why can't he talk to me? He probably doesn't wanna make you mad. Probably? Yeah, I mean, you know as well as I do that it's easier to talk to friends about these things than... Than what? Than whatever you two are. "Whatever we are." What is he saying we are? He doesn't say anything! Then what're you talking about? (CHUCKLES) Look, I'm just saying that, and I'm telling you this as your friend, okay? As your best friend, that, if you don't give your guy attention, somebody else will. Are you trying to tell me something? No, Alaska, (CHUCKLES) of course not. That's not what I'm saying. That's not what I'm saying, oh, my goodness. Okay, look, he loves you, okay? Okay? And I love you. Look, I just want you to be happy. So, come out with us, Friday night. (LAUGHS) Thad found this really cool place in the city that's got music. Just tell Derek that you'll be there. Okay. (SIGHS) How's it coming along? Oh, it looks great. Nice job. But the time, it's at six. I kinda thought that sounded a little late. Don't old people go to bed early? Allie, the event has to be after dinner. The soonest is six. Believe me, they have no trouble staying up, if they're having fun. And I have to be there? Oh, of course, silly, you're the new host. Just add your name in there. Great. (WARM ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MRS. FOSTER YELPS) Watch it! (PHONE RINGS) - Hello? - I'm sorry, I'm so... Paying resident here! Are you okay? Resident, not inrament. Are you even supposed to be up like this? Hello? What are you, a doctor now? (SIGHS) Uh, no. (CHUCKLES) You're doin' that, uh, talent show, right? Yeah? Do you have to audition for it or something? Audition? I don't think so, no. Oh. Okay. Did you wanna be in the talent show? Well, if you're insisting. You could put my name down. Okay. (CHUCKLES) Okay. And... Keep your face out of that phone while you're walkin'. You could kill somebody, next time. Oh, boy. You want me to slap that smile off your face? You think I won't? You think he's gonna stop me from poundin' you into that wall? I don't give a (BLEEP). I'm gonna be in here till I'm an old lady. What're they gonna do to me, huh? Give me some more years? I will beat that smile off your face, till you don't know how to smile anymore. That's what it's like in here. Nobody cares whether you live or whether you die, and what's yours ain't yours, it belongs to the biggest and the baddest. Do you think anybody gives a (BLEEP) in here, you had a bad childhood, or somebody treated you wrong, or nobody listened to you? You better wake up. (TENSE MUSIC) (ALASKA GASPS) What's your problem? What's your problem? (ALASKA CHUCKLES) (ALASKA SIGHS) (SUSPENSEFUL WESTERN MUSIC) (JAUNTY WESTERN MUSIC) (ALASKA SCREAMS) Uh, hi. Welcome to the seventh semi-annual variety show. We hope you enjoy the performances, and the showcase of talent so prevalent here at Sunnyvale. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) I bet I can guess what card you picked. All right, let's see if you can guess. All right, what is it? - Nine of spades. - You're perfectly right, yay! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) But you know, Miss Wheeler, she keeps us movin' out, doesn't she, yeah? I mean, those double dose of beans every week, I mean, new meaning to the word passing on the left, you walk down the hall. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But what about us? We'll always have Panama City. I said I'd never leave you. Well, our problems don't amount to a hill of beans, in this crazy world. Someday, you'll understand that. Now, now. Here's lookin' at you, kid. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) (RIGID PIANO MUSIC) (PHONE VIBRATES) Y'all remember the Serenity Prayer, right? There's another one called the Senility Prayer, and it basically says, "God, grant me the grace "to forget the people I never really liked anyway." - Miss Wheeler? - Yeah? I'm sorry, but is it gonna be a problem if I leave a little early? My friends just have plans. Friends? Or a friend? I mean, it's up to you. But... (MRS.

(MACHINE BLEEPS RHYTHMICALLY) Hi. (CHUCKLES) I don't feel well. Where am I? You're in the hospital. You fainted. What're you doin' here? Gotta get my service hours in somehow, right? Here, let me, um, yeah. I can call the nurse, that's what they get paid for. Right. Right, I'm sorry. I should probably be getting home anyway, it's really late. What time is it? It's about two in the morning. - What's got you up late, Mrs. Foster? What can I get you? This cursed bed, it's like something from a cheap motel. Was your family not able to help you? Who? That girl? She's not my family. Oh. I'm sorry, I just thought she was a relative or something. She hasn't left your side since you were brought in. (WARM ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (PHONE CHIMES) Dad. Don't even say anything. And I don't even wanna know where you've been. I texted you. I'm not stupid, Alaska. I know there's some guy. What? No, I... (CHUCKLES) We're going to church, Sunday. (ALASKA CHUCKLES) We're going to church, or I am selling your car. Fine. We can be just as fake there as we are everywhere else, right? Why now, though? You have some sort of revelation or something? We need God, Allie. (SOMBER MUSIC) (ALASKA CHUCKLES) "We need God." Right, just like we needed him four years ago? What happened, did she take him with her? 'Cause he hasn't been around since. You can't blame God, he's always there. And I know that I haven't been, I know that. So if you've gotta blame somebody, blame me. I do. I'd like to read to you this morning from Colossians 3, verse 13. "Bear with each other, and forgive one another, "if any of you has a grievance against someone. "Forgive, as the Lord forgave you." You know, in the Old Testament, when the Israelites, God's covenant people, would displease him, he would send punishments. Famine, plague, hordes of locusts, to drive his people back to living like he wanted them to live. But it wouldn't last. Sooner or later, they'd give into temptation and sin again. Of course, God could've forced his will on the Israelites. Forced them to live on the path of righteousness. But from the beginning, God has always wanted loving disciples, serving of their own free will, not mindless slaves. So, he sent a savior for them. For all of us. He sent his son, Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Christ teaches us, through his example and his words, compassion, acceptance, forgiveness. We learn that we are forgiven through God's love. And we are expected to forgive others, through our love for our fellow man. Sometimes that's tough. It's easy to love those that are good to us, right? But the folks that are not so good to us, not so much. Loving your enemies enough to forgive them brings us closer to living our lives the way God wants us to live them, the way Jesus lived his life, and any other thing that Christians can do. Let us pray today, for the strength, the grace and the love to forgive. AMANDA: Allie, good morning, hi. Morning. You're here early. Teacher work day. Allie, that was really sweet, what you did. Friday. You didn't have to stay all night with Mrs. Foster. How is she? (SIGHS) Well, she's back and resting. Doctors think it may have been a mini stroke. She's had them before, but with each one, it seems to take a little more from her. What about her family, her kids? From what she's told me, I don't think she could ever have kids. Like many of our other residents, we're pretty much all she has. (SOMBER MUSIC) You wanna see her? Sorry, did I wake you? You didn't. I'm glad you're feelin' better. I didn't get the chance to tell you, but, you have a really good singing voice. Like... Amazing. I haven't used my voice like that in... Forever. So, what were you, like a real singer or something? Well... I had a couple of gigs. ALASKA: That's you? That's me. Your cute looks are gonna fade too. That's not what I mean, I mean, that's really cool. You were like famous. Who's that? That's the one. (CHUCKLES) "The one?" My Tommy. The one I married. Like your soulmate? Love at first sight type stuff? There's no such thing. He had to work at it. He was the best looking man around, but that didn't make him forever-material. I didn't acknowledge him for a long time. (CHUCKLES) I wasn't gonna marry just anybody. We were together, over 50 years. Wow. (KNOCKS) Sorry, I was just coming to check in on you two. What you lookin' at? Did you know that Mrs. Foster used to be a professional singer? Well, I had my suspicions. I came to see if you wanted any lunch? I can have Jimmy bring it in. Okay. (ALASKA CHUCKLES) Wait, what? You're my two o'clock? That's us. - How you doin', Conner? - Great, get onboard. (PEACEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Boat keeping you busy? Not as busy as I'd like, but, picked up a part-time recently. Yeah? A couple of late nights, but it really helps. That's good. Real good. I know it's been kind of tough. Real seasonal around here. Got that right. Good to see you at church. Yeah. Yeah, it's uh, (CHUCKLES) it's been a while. Oh, you know, the only reason I bring it up is 'cause just got back myself, last year. I don't even know how long it had really been. And Annette was the best, you know, she uh, she had real patience, let's just say that. It wasn't anything like phenomenal or like divine intervention or anything like that. I just knew that, I needed to make a decision. You know, all-in, or all-out. And once I realized that God is all-in, (CHUCKLES) always was? The choice was easy. Come on, get one! Your kids doing all right? Just enjoy them when they're young. Your girl, Alaska, right? She's gotta be about college age, that right? Yeah, she's 18, but she thinks that she's older. She's got a lot of growin' up to do. I don't know about you, but, I still got a lot of growing up to do, too. (BOTH CHUCKLE) You like gotta get back anytime? Only if you want to. (CHUCKLES) That's what I'm talkin' about. That's good. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (LAUGHTER) It is my favorite color, come on. AMY: It's true. (GROUP LAUGHS) You know, it's good to have you back among the living, Als? (CHUCKLES) I was thinking I might have to check myself into a hotel soon. You guys. I'm touched. I don't know what's going on. Yeah, you wouldn't, 'cause you've only been in the picture for about five minutes. (CHUCKLES) That's harsh! - It's all good. (AMY LAUGHS) You guys ready to get outta here? Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, let's go. All right, so Alaska, why don't you ride with Derek? Derek's going with Thad, I don't want you to be alone. I can take Thad. No, Amy, we came together. I don't see what the big deal is. Derek hasn't seen you, I just thought... No, you don't think! - Alaska, come on! (SOMBER MUSIC) You're dead. I'm perfectly capable of walking outside. I thought you wanted to enjoy the view? I'm just checking something. Mm-hm. Sorry. What's so important? Or should I say, who's so important? Hm? You're right. It's nothing. It's no one. Not important. (SIGHS) Dad? You didn't see him outside? He just left. I'll be back. Thanks for warning. (MELANCHOLY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HAMMERING CLACKS) Hey! Hey! Saturday? Pretty sure the whole street's still sleeping! Was sleeping. (WARM ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Those hours really crept on me. Didn't realize they were gonna be so fast. Guess I was here a lot. You did your time, yeah. Didn't really feel all that much like jail. Well, maybe at first, but... You need to get back to your school, your life. Doesn't mean I can't visit every once in a while, right? (MELANCHOLY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - Mrs. Foster? - Tommy? Tommy? What's going on, are you okay? Where is this? Okay, okay. It's okay, we're gonna get you home. We're gonna get you back. Okay. I know you, I know you. I know you. I'm bringing Mrs. Foster back in. Something's happening. Nothing much we can do for her during these episodes, except make her comfortable. Not a good last day, I know, but she'll be okay, really. You can always come back and visit. I'll sign off on your paperwork before you leave. Mrs. Foster? I'd like to see you spend more time outside. Moving around, visiting with people. Being energetic. Now, we've talked about this before. Hm. If you say so! Yeah, well... It'll come back to you. When will it come back to me? I'll tell you what. Next time you can't remember something, whether it's an event, a date or a name, I'd like to see you take a deep breath, close your eyes, and connect with the feeling of what you can't remember. Do you think you can do that for us? If you say so. ALASKA: Sorry, am I interrupting something? No. We're done here. All right, so, I'm Dr. Nelson. What's your name? Alaska Rose. Oh! You're Alaska, I heard much about you. You're doing a fine job for us, thank you. Thank you. Mrs. Foster? We'll be talking, and oh, (CHUCKLES) remember to take your meds. All right, see ya. You're not here to sell me something, are you? It's me, Alaska. You remember me, right? You remember. I remember. I remember you used to like to touch my things. You just have such cool things. (MRS. FOSTER CHUCKLES) I wanted to thank you. (WARM ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) For what? For being my friend. We're friends. I'll see you, Mrs. Foster. See you. Alaska. (ALASKA CHUCKLES) Alaska, wait up. I never heard back from you, freak, what's up? I've just been busy. All weekend? So, what's the deal with you and Derek? He hasn't been answering his phone, either. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GASPS) Is that you? No way. I don't know what you're talking about. (AMY CHUCKLES) Miss Rose. It's about time you arrived. Close the door and have a seat. What's going on? Sit down, please. The officer would like to ask you some questions about an incident. Your name is Alaska Rose? Yeah. I'm Officer Brennan, you've seen me around, right? Yes? I wanna ask you a question about an incident that took place a couple nights ago. "An incident?" What is your relationship with Derek Austin? Were you with this guy on the 12th? Can I have my dad here for this? You're 18, right? Yeah. Were you with the boy or not? He gave me a ride home. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. Alaska. This is a very serious matter. This boy claims you assaulted him. I assaulted him? He claims that you hit him repeatedly in the face and the head with a hard object, until he was unconscious. He also claims that you took $100 from his wallet and fled the scene. The hard object was my fist. You admit to the assault? I hit him, yeah. Yeah, but he deserved it! What happened? He was giving me a ride home, and he told me he wanted to talk. And I said I had to go home, but okay. Then we went to the beach and he started acting like he didn't just wanna talk. And then he leaned in to kiss me, and I said no, and he did it anyway, so I punched him! And I went home. He put his hands on you, at all, or anything? No. But you did strike him? Did you go into his wallet? Of course not. He has a witness to corroborate his story. That's impossible, we were completely alone, what witness? Look, I'm not going to make an arrest, but I have to file this charge. This is insane, I didn't even do anything wrong! Calm down. He's a liar. We're gonna have to just let the courts decide. No. I can't get in anymore trouble. Alaska. He has injuries. You just spontaneously admitted to the assault. Now, you will get a summons, and you'll just have to show up at court, okay? Please, listen to me, I really, I can't go back to court. Thank you, Principal. You, you don't understand, please, I, Miss Gray? It's out of my hands, Alaska. His parents are pushing the issue. Mrs. Foster? Sorry. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) What are you doing? I thought you were finished here? Why'd you come? No. No. It's, it's not all that tragic. Look what you're doing! I... I started taking these. I don't remember when. Sometimes, you have to, make things better. For everyone. No. It's not better! It's never better. You gave me, you gave me ever-so-good last days. You can't. You can't do this to me. You can't go away, too. Get a hold of yourself, girl. I was 13. I was 13 years old when I found my mom. I found her! I had to be the one! I was just getting home from school, and I wanted to show her how good I did on my paper. I thought I'd make her happy and she was always... (SOBS) She was always so sad. I kept calling, and calling and calling and calling for her, but she wouldn't answer me. And then I looked in the bathroom. And she filled it up with hot water, so that she wouldn't make a mess. I... Found her. And I found her too late. I couldn't stop her. I couldn't stop her. (SOBS) Please, Mrs. Foster, please, don't do this. Please, Mrs. Foster, please, don't make me live that again. Please. (SOBS) (SOBS) Her hair was so soft. It was like silk. I always imagined it'd be what angel hair would feel like. And she had this laugh. It was so high-pitched that it made everybody else laugh. And then one day, she just stopped laughing. I always thought it was when we moved here. And I hated this place. I think I hated it because I thought it made her sad. Or maybe she was so sad because I was sad. I don't know. Don't blame yourself. I don't. My dad's the one that forced us here. He spent all our money on some stupid boat, and then he wanted to start a business, but when we got here, there were like 15,000 other businesses just like it. We were always behind on bills. We never had enough to get by, and my mom was always talking about it. And I tried to help, I would watch my little brother so she wasn't so overwhelmed all the time. But Dad was never there. Working? All the time. Hm. It's like he couldn't comprehend what was even happening. He couldn't see what he'd caused. I mean, we left our home, our life, our friends, everything. He couldn't even see how miserable she was. I'm no expert, but I suspect there was more to your mom being sad than just that. Have you ever thought about how it made your father feel? What it must be like for him, no? (ALASKA SIGHS) Can I, uh... See that? Thanks. Do you wanna come a drive for some ice cream? It's the best cure for feeling like crap. Okay. Can I change? Conner, thank you so much for agreeing to work with our youth program, you know, I think those kids are gonna benefit from it, but you know what else? You are, too. Win-win blessing. Thank you. Thanks, Bishop. Anything else on your mind? Something I'd be able to help with? Well, I... (CHUCKLES) I haven't really talked about it since. (SIGHS) It's okay, buddy. That's what I'm here for. (CONNER SIGHS) How can I, um... How is there peace after... One of our favorite hymns is "Families Can Be Together Forever." How do I help my children, if their parents aren't gonna be together? Conner. I can't even begin to imagine what you've been through. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) The burden you've had to carry. Someone you love takes their own life, just, just leaves behind so much pain, so many questions. But Conner, God loves you. He feels every bit of your pain. Everything I've read, everything I feel, it's murder. Is she lost? Let me ask you a question. You ever wonder why repentance is taught so often, so lovingly, especially in the New Testament? You know, a part of repentance is recognizing that you've sinned in the first place, right? Isn't it reasonable to believe that somebody who would be in such a state of mind, to decide to end their own life, might not even be able to recognize that they'd sinned? I think, ultimately, only God has the answer, Conner. But God is a god of love, not of punishment. He would never abandon one of his children, in her greatest hour of need. Romans 8 tells us, "Nothing will separate us from the love of God." Nothing. Nothing will separate you from the love of the Father. Dad, I need to talk to you. I'm almost done with my community service hours. Well, it's about time, that's good. Now we can get to thinking about college again. Yeah. Is there somethin' else? Somebody lied about me and called the cops. Okay, what happened? I don't know. I really don't know, I was just trying to get a ride home, and I was with Amy and I ended up with this guy named Derek. And who's Derek? He's my friend. Or at least, I thought he was my friend. And Amy just left me there, and I was stuck in the car with him. And? I punched him in the face, and like a lot. What? Did he touch you, are you hurt? No, no, I would've broke his arm, but... Now he's lying about me, and he's saying all this stuff and he called the police. I have a court date. (TENSE MUSIC) I can't get in anymore trouble and I'm, I'm really scared. The judge is gonna send me to jail and I'm really scared. Okay, okay, okay. Sit down. All right. If you go into that court room and you are completely honest it's all gonna work out. (ALASKA CHUCKLES) That's not the point. That judge hates me. She's gonna put me away the minute I walk in that courthouse and she said it herself. What do I do? What'll I do? Pray? That's easy for you to say, you didn't just throw away two months of your life to go to jail for how-long. I'm not the one who made the choices that you made. Alaska, decisions have consequences. What? You don't think I know that decisions have consequences? You think anyone in this family doesn't know that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that's not... I'm sorry. Allie? Allie. Allie. I know you blame me. - I can't get it out of my head. (SOBS) (SCREAMS) Why would she do it? Why would she do that if she knew that I was gonna be the one to come home and find her? Why would she do that? (SOBS) Why would she do that, why would she do that? She left me. If she knew this, why would she do that? (SOBS) She still loves us, she still loves us. Why would she do that? I don't hate my mom. I don't hate my mom, I don't hate my mom. I don't hate my mom. (SOBS) Oh, honey. We're gonna get through this, okay? Somehow... We are gonna get through this. Where's Kyle? Why can't he hear me? Oh, he's at a friend's house tonight. - Brat. (CONNER CHUCKLES) You can exchange punches with him tomorrow, when he gets back. (SIGHS) You're gonna get through this court thing, too. I promise. If I do... Will you make sure that we do more stuff together? Yeah. Promise? Promise, we need to. (SIGHS) Allie, um... Oh, nevermind, it's stupid. What's wrong? I just, um... You know, your mom and I, we had the talk with you when you were little and I just, I... I wish that she would be here for the follow-up. "The talk?" Well, I know, I try not to think about it. I don't even like to think about it, but you're out all night, you're with your friends. Your friends. Look at me. (MELANCHOLY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I wanted so much more for you. And I remember that promise that you made to me when you were little. Never. Okay? I never forget my promises. (PHONE VIBRATES) Hello? AMANDA: Allie, good morning, I hope it's not too early. It's always too early. Gotta get up for school though anyway, what's up? AMANDA: I know you're finished here, I just thought you should know, Mrs. Foster was taken to the hospital again last night. What's wrong? AMANDA: She hasn't been able to breathe very well. They think she has fluid in her lungs, but they need to run some tests. Where is she? (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) No. (CHUCKLES) You're not gonna do this. You're not gonna pull some passive-aggressive hack, just to do what you wanted to do before. Okay? You promised me. I mean, not in so many words, but, you promised you'd never think like that again. After everything I shared with you. Everything we talked about. You know you promised. Look, I... I get it now. (CHUCKLES) The world doesn't revolve around me. But it doesn't revolve around you, either. I need you to wanna live. You're not alone. None of us are alone. Look, I know you can hear me. (CHUCKLES) I need you to tell me you wanna live. Show me somethin', Mrs. Foster. Even if it's just to get me out of your business. I need you to tell me you wanna live. Please. (CHUCKLES) (WARM ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) There it is. I knew you were in there. I knew you could hear me. It's okay. You're okay, everything's gonna be okay. (MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC) (PHONE RINGS) Bay Rose Tours. AMANDA: Oops, I think I have the wrong number. - No, sorry, it's Allie. (CHUCKLES) AMANDA: Oh. I'm just at work, I picked up the wrong phone. AMANDA: Okay, you wanted me to keep you updated. Yeah, how is Miss Foster, is she okay? AMANDA: They're not sure, Allie, I'm sorry. The pneumonia's worse, it could go either way. "Either way," what is that supposed to mean? AMANDA: I'm sorry, we just have to be ready. Wait a minute, will ya? Dad, we talked about this. It's gonna be okay. It's not that easy, Allie. It's just... I haven't done anything like this in years. I don't know if I'm ready, I don't know if I'm, you know. I think you're ready. Isn't that all that matters? And through your faith, you may be healed of any affliction. Your Heavenly Father knows you personally. He knows of your needs, and of your righteous desires. He has sent his son to atone for us all. That through him, we might all be saved. You are blessed with this pure knowledge, and the perfect knowledge that, through faith, all things are possible. Mountains are moved. And the hardest of hearts, melted, and sanctified. You are blessed. Even now, this very moment, to be healed, and to rise from this bed. That you may walk by your own power. That you may have joy in this life, and feel the love of your father in heaven. And the love of all of us around you. And I leave this blessing upon your head, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. (WARM ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Be seated. Our first case is a violation of a pre-trial agreement. Regional charge was illegal possession of alcohol and ID fraud. Alaska Rose, are you here? Do you remember what I told you the last time you stood before me? Yes, ma'am. (WARM ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Well, that's good. So none of this should come as a surprise. You are facing two months on the original charges, and up to a year on this latest allegation. Ma'am? Ma'am. Mrs. Foster? JUDGE: Miss Rose, who is this? I'm your key witness. (CHUCKLES) Witness for what, ma'am? This isn't a trial. Now, if you'll please be seated. You mean to tell me you sentenced this girl without a trial? Her sentence is already set. She violated the terms of her pre-trial agreement by being charged with another crime. Now, unless you're an attorney with a license to practice in this jurisdiction, I would kindly ask you to take a seat. (CHUCKLES) No. I'm not a lawyer. I'm just a friend. Now, that might not have much weight here today, but I have to believe that character means something in this courtroom. I agree, it is the sum total of our choices, which make up our character. Which is why Miss Rose is here today. Because of some of the choices that she's made. Well, what about about the other ones? Pardon me? Well, you said she's here because of some of her choices. What about the other ones? I think I've been very patient with you. Oh, you don't know patience, until you have experienced constipation, in your late 80s. What is your name, ma'am? Julianna Foster. What is it that you're wanting to say to this court, Miss Foster? I only know this girl, because she was forced into my life. And what put her there? You? This court system? Yeah. Maybe. But the real reason that caused her showin' up in my room, and gratin' on my nerves, is because of her choices. You see, I believe that everything happens for a reason. Now, my mind isn't always that good, and things get kinda sketchy sometimes, but there are some things that I never forget. Like the day before Alaska showed up. I had made up my mind. I had decided that life had given me all it had to give me, and I was going to end it. Now, I'm not gonna get all religious on you, because I've never really been a church-goin' woman, but that night, I surely, prayed to God. I talked to God and I asked him to send me an answer. If my decision was the right one, then send me a sign. And the next day, this young woman showed up in my room! Now, I didn't have much information about this hearing today, but I knew if I had the possibility of making a difference, I needed to be here. (SOBS) Your Honor. Alaska Rose, saved my life. Now, if that doesn't count for something, what else does? Thank you, Miss Foster. I appreciate your testimony, I truly do. Now, if you'll have a seat, I would ask Miss Rose to step forward. Miss Rose the purpose of your community service at Sunnyvale was to bring you to an understanding of the seriousness of your actions, and an awareness of those other than yourself. Unfortunately, this last incident with the boy complicates matters and will have to be handled in a separate hearing. However, based on direct feedback, I am convinced that the original goal, associated with your impending sentence, has been fulfilled and I am dismissing the charges. So ordered. (GAVEL CLACKS) Is everything okay? Officer? Have a seat, Mr. Austin. But, I had... Sit down. What's this? Oh, that's for your statement, for what really happened between you and Alaska Rose that night. I already gave a statement. So did he. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) And so did Amy James. These are the additional statements. This story's becoming real clear. Now it's your turn. If you don't wanna do what's right for Alaska, then do what's right for yourself. Filing a false statement is a serious crime, Mr. Austin. Your friends are smart enough to figure that out.
