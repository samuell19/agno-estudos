Thank you. All these women. They follow him, even to the grave. How is it possible? Well, why not? They loved him very deeply. Each in her own way. Passionately. Kindly. Forever. What appears impossible is that there is no jealousy. No envy, no rage, not even cynicism. It may seem like a miracle, but I don't like miracles. I prefer to think it's something simple. As simple as that he really and truly loved all these women. That could do strange and wonderful things, couldn't it? Well, yes, to me too. Those few here who know me as his doctor, his analyst, hardly think I only mourn my patient. And it gives me pleasure to join my sisters as a lover in weeds. A widow without marriage, openly bereft. He came to me on the recommendation of his physician. Beginning with some mild anxiety, he had become more frozen and unable to make decisions. For a man who had all his life been given to the utmost daring and impulsiveness, whether to work or not to work, presented an unsolvable and terrifying issue. The multiplicity of items on a menu had become a nightmare challenge. He could only dine out with trusted friends, always female, and only when they did the ordering. He was a most intelligent man. Remarkably intuitive, gentle, almost soulful. And with eyes that saw and caressed with equal intensity. If he was in fact unable to make choices, I sensed an enormous potential locked behind those eyes and constrained gestures. In the beginning, he hastened to reassure me that his tragic state of inertia, he referred to it as his "impotence," was most recent, hopefully transient and altogether out of character. To prove it, he told me a story based on a pair of legs. There were the most beautiful legs I'd ever seen. What was so special about them? Uh, well, they were-- They were long, very long. Shapely, obviously. They were athletic too, but not too muscular. And they moved so gracefully. Um, they were fantastic, and I just couldn't help myself. I just had to find out who they belonged to. Is that crazy? I don't think so. I don't think so either. I didn't think so, I still don't. Get back in the car! Come on, Bruiser. Come on! Hi. Hi. I thought you'd be at the gallery all day. I was going to, but I got off early. Hello, this is David Fowler, my car is insured by you. I'd like to talk about an accident. Did you have an accident? No. Just hang on a second. No, I didn't-- What is that? It was supposed to be a surprise. I wanted you to find it. Oh. Go in the kitchen, and when I'm through I'll find it and it'll be a surprise. Oh. Okay? Okay. Are you still there? Yeah, see, the car was parked on Pico Boulevard. And I-- I wasn't in the car at the time. I just came out and someone had hit it, kept on going. I have the driver's license number right here. It's 1-G-A-1-0-2-1. Yeah. Uh, you think you'll have any trouble tracing it? Yeah. It's just a matter of interest. I'd like to know who it is. I was kind of semi-living with a lady named Courtney Wade. Who loves to cook. Bright, sweet, funny lady. But that afternoon, I wasn't very good company. I had a Houston commission that was behind schedule. On top of that, I couldn't stop thinking about those legs. They just kept strolling through my mind. I'll get it. Hello? It was the insurance company. Her name was Agnes Chapman. And she lived in Santa Monica. Oh, um... Watch the dog. I called her from a gas station at the end of her street. First I didn't think I had a chance, but she had a sense of humor. She admitted she was intrigued, and like I'd hoped, she felt safe to meet me at the gas station. I remember thinking: Jesus, I'm about to meet the woman with the most beautiful legs in the world. And now I'm not really sure I want to. Why not? Suppose the top half didn't live up to the bottom half. Hi. Hi. David Fowler. Agnes Chapman. You wanna go somewhere and talk? Um... No, let's talk here first. Okay. Okay. Heh. Oh, God, you wore pants. I didn't know the rules. Sorry-- So did you. Yeah, well... But, I mean, you have such great-looking legs, I'm disappointed. Isn't that sweet? Just too bad I'm not crazy about ladykillers. Well, I'm not either. You don't think you qualify as one? No, I don't. Uh-huh. What would you call yourself? I've never had to come up with a definition. Is it necessary for us to have a relationship? A relationship? My God! You're a fast worker, huh? I'd better leave before someone gets pregnant. I'm not that fast. I don't know. Please don't go. Why did you come? I was inquisitive. Ah, me too. I saw your legs and I was inquisitive. You were acquisitive. Sexually, of course. Well... Come, be honest. A little bit. Yeah. I've gotta be honest with you too. Um... You saw my cousin. What? Yeah, my cousin. She's visiting from Canada. And she borrowed my car. She does have beautiful legs. She's a dancer. Was that your cousin? Mm-hm. Oh, but she'll be back around Christmas. Then why don't you and I have dinner? No. Mm-mm. Why not? Because it's my cousin you want. No, I don't. I've never met her. I don't care about her. I met you. I think you're charming. I think you're enormously engaging. I do. So, what do you say? Usually I'm also very cautious. So I'd like to think about it, okay? Can I call you? Um... Why don't you give me your phone number? I'll call you. Oh. I don't have a pen. I have a great memory. Oh, sure. No, I do. I was very good in school. Oh, yeah? Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. 6-5-4. 6-5-4. 1-6-5-4. 1-6-5-4. Simple. You never need a pencil. 654-1654. Okay. I'll hear from you, huh? Maybe. Think about it. Okay. Bye. Bye. I was 90 percent sure she was lying. She didn't have a cousin. She just didn't like me. There was still a 10 percent chance that I was wrong. So the next morning, heh, I parked up the street. And when she came out, I followed her. All I wanted to do was get a look at her legs. Again, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Breathe in, two, three, four, and out. And in. And out. Breathe in, two, three, four, and out. Breathe in. And out. And stretch. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Across the body. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And clap. Two, three, four, five, six, seven. In fours. And one, two, three, four. One, two, three. Through the legs. And five, six, seven, eight. And stretch. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Reach, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four, five, six. Oh, no. Damn. Bruiser? Bruiser! Do you consider yourself a good cook? Oh, just average, I guess. But I love to cook. I just made David a chocolate cake. Oh, shit, the surprise. Do we have a trivia question? Yes, I'll tell you what it is. The prize is dinner for two at Le Cirque. Bruiser. Are you all right? Bruiser. No, probably not until about 8 or 9. They understand your time problem. And they've agreed to work late. The first two pieces look great. Okay, I'll have an early dinner and then come down. Okay. Nancy? Yes? What's the name of the vet that we took Bruiser to? Dr. Winters. Why, what did he eat? A chocolate cake. I'll see you later. Hi. Hi. Yes, I should have known. I was desperate. And childish. Hmm. You really think I lied to you, don't you? Yeah. You don't believe that I have a cousin with fantastic legs? No. There's only one way I can convince you. Where's the shower? Hi. Hi. Disappointed? You mean there's more? No. No, I meant, you know, my cousin. Oh, your cousin, yeah. Your cousin will never enter my mind again. You're such a liar. Well, I mean, I wanna think of her... Mm. ...from time to time, but, uh... these are the only pair of legs in my life other than my own, of course. Well, I got the right one. Oh, aren't you cute? Would you like to have dinner tonight? I can't. I'm having dinner with someone. Oh. Is it serious? I thought it might be. Up until an hour ago. I'll do some thinking and let you know. Mr. 654-1654. Heh. Just so you can do some thinking too. My cousin's name is Cynthia. And she'll be back December 21st. Okay? Yeah. Bye. So confusing. What is? The way I feel afterwards. Agnes is wonderful. Sweet. They're all wonderful. It's so confusing. I start worrying about all the women I'm never gonna know. While I'm pursuing them, I'm destroyed by the memory of the women I just left. Perhaps your adoration of women is only matched by your hunger for a new experience. You feel a deepening sense of loss with each new ending. Yes. So when you go forward, you always leave something behind. Yes. What are you thinking about? I was thinking about the first woman I was ever with. The one you never forget. I was 15. I can see the room. I can smell her perfume. I desperately didn't want her to know that I was a virgin. This your first time, kid? Hell no. Wait here. I remember thinking I wanna get out of here. I can get out before she comes back. I was glad I didn't. This is Darla. Darla. Oh, boy. I will be forever grateful to that understanding, generous, older woman. I think Darla was about 18. She was wonderful. Just wonderful. She left me with an enduring appreciation for the women of the street. I remember her name. Majesta. And she looked like her name. She walked very fast, so that the potential customers would have to chase her to find out if she was really a whore. My mother walked very fast. Determined. Always like she had some clear destination in mind. Like she owned the sidewalk. Everyone said she walked just like a lady. Said she walked like a lady because... that way she got more money than the rest of the streetwalkers. Everybody said that I... I had... I had her for a mother, but I had a thousand fathers. Kids say terrible things to each other sometimes. I got in a lot of fights. I nearly always got beat. It was worth it. The blood and the bruises were a small price to pay for the comfort I received and the adoration I could give. Were those assaults on his mother's virtue in any way true? Perhaps. According to David, she had endless male friends and often trusted him with passionate letters to post to those men. Certainly his own virtue was fragile, since jealousy made him read all of them and post but a very few. Perhaps just those experiences made it inevitable that all women should be defended by him, yearned for by him and forgiven everything. Mm. What are you thinking? Oh, I was just thinking how I love watching women. I love the way they walk. I love all the different shapes, the way they move. You know, there's a time when we all disappear. When I first realized that I thought if I can't see them, heh, I won't want them. Heh. Wrong, as a matter of fact, what I couldn't see I just wanted all the more. And then, just when it starts to really frustrate me: Spring. And they all come out. In pretty bright dresses and high heels. And I'm, uh... I'm resurrected. What else? Uh, what else? Oh, well... There's the beach. I can only handle about one day a year at the beach. Nancy is special in my life. Not only because she turned out to be a first-rate assistant. But also because she's the only woman that I didn't sleep with when I had the chance. I wonder what would've happened to her if I hadn't decided to take Sunset that night. Hookers were out in force. For about a mile, I counted half a hundred. And then for several blocks, nothing. Then I saw her. She looked young, vulnerable, and out of place. Like a little girl wearing her sister's clothes and her mother's makeup. I acted on impulse. I wasn't sure, but I wanted another look. She was either not what she appeared, or she devised the ultimate little girl come-on. Or she was completely inexperienced and just plain scared. Can I give you a lift? How far are you going? How far do you wanna go? Fifty dollars' worth. Get in. Hi, Bruiser. Hi, Bruiser. Nice dog. All he does is poop and eat. You cold? Yeah, a little. I've gotta take my shoes off. Want some coffee? How about some tea? How about mint tea? Oh, no, coffee will be fine. What do you do? Most of the time I try to find the right light switch. I'm a sculptor. A what? Sculptor. Would I know you? Sorry? Would I've heard of your name? Oh, uh, my name is David Fowler. Oh, sorry, I've never heard of you. That's all right. Until about 15 minutes ago I never heard of you. Could I have a look around? Sure. Did you paint this? No. That's a Ron Davis. That's my work. I like it. It feels cold. It's granite. I like the way it feels. I like for my sculpture to be felt. Not just looked at. It's sexy, maybe. Why not? I don't know. Just seems strange, a piece of granite being sexy. Did you ever see Michelangelo's David? Only in a book. It's very sexy. Are we gonna have sex? Nope. Why not? Not because I don't find you attractive. I do. I think... you're very desirable. Then why not? Why did you pick me up? Why did you bring me here? Get you off the street. Change your mind, maybe. And make me your personal secretary? Anyway, how do you know I don't like what I'm doing? I don't. I just know it's something you shouldn't be doing. Do you like it? No. But I can't do anything else. Sure you can. Like what? I'm not sure. Sure. I'll think of something. Look, I gotta be getting back. I don't want you to go. You can stay here tonight. Tono will kill me. The hell with Tono. I'll pay him for the whole night. How much? Now, how much is it? Two hundred dollars. All right. I still gotta call him. The phone's upstairs in the bedroom. Take a hot shower before you catch your death of cold. You sound just like my mother. Thank God you didn't say "father." I never had a father. I told her the truth about wanting to get her off the street, change her mind about being a whore. The rest of the truth was that I wanted her. That was the problem. I could have her. She was paid for. She was sleeping in my bed. What if I did have her? What would her chances be then? She smelled of soap and sleep. You know, if I do nothing good for the rest of my life, I'm sure that that moment earned me some little time in heaven. The next morning, I introduced her to Harry and-- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I introduced her to Harry and Carl. She's been working for me ever since. One day, we went to the market. And we ran into this guy named Tono. He used to be her pimp. He went after her with a knife. She hit him with a frozen leg of lamb. We had to call the paramedics. I have to go to Houston tomorrow. I feel like sitting up. Do what you feel like. Maybe I don't feel like sitting up. I feel like having a cigarette. When did you start smoking again? This morning. Ha, ha. I'm terrified of flying. I mean... Well... Not so much terrified of flying as I am of crashing. I used to fly, but I never seemed to be as frightened as I am now. I seem to be really frightened. You can always call me. Mm. From the plane? You know what I mean. Yes, I know what you mean. Maybe I really don't want to go to Houston, you know? Maybe what I really-- Am I keeping you from something? As a matter of fact, your time is up. Oh. Parking ticket. Did I ever show you a picture of my dog? Yes. Bye-bye. Bye. I'll see you next Thursday. Right. Right. I had my toes down here. Sorry. Because of his inertia and difficulty with choices, there were times when I literally had to push him from my consultation room. He couldn't decide if he was to remain or to leave. And he would be terribly embarrassed by his dilemma. This minor confusion is proving to be an excellent mirror reflecting an infinity of doubts concerning staying or leaving. To stay with his love is agonizing because it means to give up all the unknown lovers to come. To leave his love is equally agonizing for it means to feel alone and abandoned. I'm sorry, I can't find my keys. Oh. It fell down here while I was lying down or sitting up. Here they are. Oh. Well, uh... I'll see you next Thursday. Have a good time in Houston. I don't really want to go. We're making some new progress now-- David. Goodbye. I don't wanna go to Houston. Just one more, Mr. Carr. All right, that's enough, fellas. Mr. Fowler, I'd like to congratulate you on a fine piece of work. It kind of reminds me of my wife. I don't understand it, but it sure is effective. Lulu, come here, honey. Excuse me, ladies. I want you to meet Mr. Fowler. Fowler, my wife, Louise. Hello, Mr. Fowler, how are you? Good to see you. It was Lulu's idea to give you this commission. Well, I have admired your work. Ever since I saw your show at the Los Angeles County Museum, 1968. See? I know. That was a good one too. Excuse me, Mr. Fowler. I gotta shake some hands and kiss a few behinds. Lulu, give Mr. Fowler a grand tour, would you please? I would love to. I'll see you later this afternoon. Why, you were here in September, yes? Yes. What about this afternoon? Oh, Roy's gonna barbecue. Sorry I missed you then. I was in Toledo with the El Greco exhibit. You ever been to Spain? Yeah. I just love the rice. Good to see you. We've admired the work. This is our building. Oh. Nice. I wanna show you the penthouse. That's where we live when we're not at the ranch. This is it. Roy got this French architect to take down a few walls. It's nothing special, but this is the living room. You got a great view. You can see, uh-- This is the kitchen over here. Then we got the dining room right in here. That's beautiful. Nice. You'll really like the bedroom. Oh, this is interesting. You got a watch? Sorry? Got a watch? Yes. Second hand? Sure. We got 14 minutes. Fourteen? Ten minutes for him to decide what we're doing. Yeah? Five to get up here. Oh. That makes 15. It took 65 seconds in the elevator. What if he's not right on schedule? Then we'll both get shot. Oh. Isn't this exciting? Uh-huh. We're drilling for some gas out on a section of the ranch. Geologist report looked real good. Don't know what he's gonna do. We'll see. You got four minutes. No, you did. I got four seconds. Three. Two. One. Lulu? Where are you, honey? Pretty, isn't it? What? Lulu? Hi, honey. Hi. We were just looking at the view. It's incredible. It is? I've seen a lot of views in my time, but never like this. Well, I'll be damned. Is that pretty? It's pretty. You can see the Warwick from here. Hmm. Well, you're the artist. Hey, you wanna see something real pretty? Have you been inside the bathroom? Come here, I wanna show you something. I had a French architect do this bathroom over for me. Well, that's a beautiful Chagall. Is that pretty? Oh, yes, that's pretty. Now, I want to show you here is the pisser. The Pissarro. No, no. That's a Pissarro's over there. I want to show you the pisser. This thing's got a geyser in it. - Geyser? Yeah, you know, a-- Honey, what do you call that geyser in the toilet? The bidet. That's right. The booday. Lulu's got one in her toilet in there. I thought mine was a drinking fountain till I sat down on it. It'll get your heart started in the morning. Heh. Feeling all right, Mr. Fowler? I'm feeling-- Ahem. Mr. Fowler, you're the artist. You know more about these things. But I'd rather look at this bathroom than look out that window anytime. Don't you think we better get on the ribs? Yeah, I guess we'd better get that barbecue going. Are you feeling all right? Oh, yeah. Fine. Are you sure? Sure. Hey, you wanna watch your step there. You know, you look a little puffed up. Oh, honey, wait a minute. Come here. You got something in your hair. All right, I got it. Just a little piece of fuzz. Sir. David, you gonna ride with us? No, as a matter of fact, I'm catching-- I'll see you at the barbecue. Okay. Ma'am, you were doing 75 in a 55. Sign right here. Leroy, you better take a little chicken. We can always kill a few more hens. I want you to taste this meat. It's amazing. Great ribs. Morning. Morning. I tried to call you. I decided to go back to Los Angeles. Well, get on in. I'll take you to the airport. Put the bag in the car. Thank you. Thank you. My, how lucky I stopped by. Just on my way to the car wash. Hello. Hello, this is David. I think I'll stay in Houston. I've been invited to the Derby. Okay, I'll hold your hour. Do you think I'm making a mistake? I don't think I should make that decision for you. It's important that you decide. Well, I'm gonna sleep on it for a while. I'll let you know. Thank you. Good night. Good night. There they go. And on the inside, the early leader is Headstrong. But moving up to challenge is Frosty Frenchy and Mother Lode. Then back two-and-a-half lengths from the rail is Tight Squeeze. Regal Hunter drops out of it slightly. Lightning Rod moves up from in between horses and to the far outside is Moonshot. Then going back to Glory Bound. And there goes Gay Deceiver. It's still Headstrong by a length and a half. Mother Lode is second by a head. Gay Deceiver now coming through Glory Bound and around them, there goes Moonshot. Past the grandstand it's Headstrong, Mother Lode and Lightning Rod. Around the Club House turn, it's still Headstrong. Gay Deceiver second by a head in front of Frosty Frenchy. Lightning Rod is third. Glory Bound is beginning to move on the rail. Now it's Lightning Rod challenging Frosty Frenchy. Mother Lode is two lengths ahead of Moonshot. Into the far turn it's Frosty Frenchy by a head. Lightning Rod second by a nose. Mother Lode and Moonshot neck and neck, a length in front of Gay Deceiver. Turning into the stretch, it's Frosty Frenchy. Mother Lode on the rail. Moonshot closing ground on the outside. And here comes Lightning Rod. It'll be close. Frosty Frenchy, Headstrong and Lightning Rod. Coming into the wire, it's Frosty Frenchy, Lightning Rod and Headstrong. Frosty Frenchy wins it by a length and a half. Lightning Rod is second by a nose. And Headstrong, third by-- You have anything planned for tonight? No. Because guess what? We're all alone. Just me and you. Where's Roy? He's working. Working in the building, right? No, he's in Dallas. Business meeting. When's he coming back? Won't be back till tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - That's right. What are we doing here, then? I thought you might like to be here. Wait a minute. I know you. No. David, you don't. You like risk. You like a lot of risk. If he won't be back till tomorrow, what are we doing here? Is there an Elks Club meeting here? David. Huh? The only risk this time is mine. You wanna explain that? I think I love you. I don't know what to say. Don't say nothing. Just be with me. It's just me and you. Let's just be together. What do you say about that? I say, "Yes, ma'am." You do? Yes, Ma'am Texas. Yellow rose. Yellow rose. It's just like Fred and Ginger. It is? Yeah. Fred and Ginger who? Never mind. Wow. You're like a real cowboy sometimes. What the hell was that? What? It was a dog. I heard a dog. There's no dog in here. I'm telling you, I heard a dog. Stay right here. Oh, God, it's Roy! Jesus Christ! No, not in there! I don't know. I'm not good at this. I haven't done this a lot. I'm not-- Aah! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm just here. Cleaning the closet. What's that? Oh. Well, I-- I didn't know you was gonna be here. I brought you a little present. Nice little doggie. Thought we'd name her Simba. She's so tiny, she can break wind, you don't hardly smell it. There you go, Simba. Go on. Go to Mama, Simba. Go away! Go away! Go away! Little dog! Little dog. Simba. Good dog. Oh, shit! Darling! I just love this little doggie. Why don't we take her out to the ranch right now? Oh, honey, that's 60 miles. It'll take us half an hour. Besides, that old bugbear would have her for breakfast. I'll tell you what. I'll call Bull Ray and have him order us chicken-fried steaks and a bottle of Don Perignon and we'll watch the wrestling matches on TV. Baby? Why don't you take a shower? How come? I took one this morning. Do I stink? Pumpkin? Oh. Oh. You know what for. I'll go take a shower and put on that English Leather that you like. Twice as nice. All right. Mwah. Simba, keep him company. Come here, Simba. Come in, honey. Oh, honey? I forgot to tell you, we hit gas. We did? You must have a piece of liver in there. Well, I'm gonna take my shower right now. Get squeaky clean.

No, Mrs. Carr. Keys to her Rolls? I'm gonna call somebody. Who are you calling? Yeah. Who you asking for? Who you calling? Jack. Oh. Is that cool? Go ahead. * I don't want no problem What's your name? Fowler. Fowler? That's right. Fowler. Fowler, right. Hello, Jack? I didn't mean to wake you up. There's a man here call himself Fowler. No, he's a white boy. He's about 6'2". The man's got fur on his feet. This kinda dog. He's got his fingers in his mouth. Yeah, yeah. He wants to talk to you. Hello, Jack? Listen, Jack. Mrs. Carr told me to ask you for the keys to the Rolls. It shouldn't be a problem, so tell, uh-- Tell Al to give me the keys to the Rolls, okay? Hmm? Oh. He wants to talk to you. Yo, this is me. No, it's Al. No, man, it's Al! All right, I'll take care of that. What are you doing? I'm calling Mrs. Carr. You don't need to call her. Why, is something wrong? Hmm? Okay, go ahead. Call her. Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Yeah. * I don't want no trouble There's no reason to call Mr. Carr. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, heh. Hello, Mrs. Carr? There's a man down here-- Give him the car? All right. You got yourself the car. Great. Hee-hee. I really dig your shoes. Where did you get 'em? You don't have to tell me. Here's the keys. You gotta start it for me now. Yeah, yeah. I don't normally do this. Appreciate it. Yeah. You really like that dog, don't you? Yeah. I hope you walk him. Come on. Come on. You want some money? No, that's okay. That's okay. Go ahead, take some. No, that's all right. You just have a nice trip. Yeah. See you later, Shoes. Okay. So long, Al. See you later, my man. I told you I shouldn't have gone to Houston. I said, "Why do I have to go to Houston? I don't think I should go to Houston." Why didn't you tell me I didn't have to go to Houston? Wasn't my place to stop you. You mean, if I felt like jumping out the window, you wouldn't stop me? Houston is not jumping out of a window. Houston! I beg your pardon. And it's practically the same thing. "Practically" is not fatal. Why don't you lie down again? I don't feel like lying down. What do you think of that? Okay. I would like to just call this whole session to an end right now. What do you think of that? It's your 50 minutes. You're damn right it is. It's over. You left your coat and glasses. I know that. Would you like to come and get them? * The time I get to Houston She'll be riding-- * I'll see you tomorrow. I don't think so. It was obvious that for some time to come it would be David the child that I would have to deal with. He was much worse. The Houston episode had been a regressive experience. Before Louise, he had been creatively stagnant. Now he was immobilized. Frozen. Yes? I'm sorry to call you so late. I feel like I'm gonna die! Hold on just a minute. What did you say? I can't breathe! Well, don't! Well, I'll die. You're hyperventilating. Hold your breath. Okay. Listen, you are not dying. You're having an acute anxiety attack probably brought on by dreams. Okay, now breathe out. Okay? My heart's p-pounding and I'm sh-shaking. The dream frightened you. It's the adrenaline. Breathe in again. Okay. Okay, in a few minutes you'll be feeling much better. You'll probably be a little weak, so you should get something to eat. Preferably carbohydrates. Some warm milk will help you get back to sleep. I don't wanna sleep. Well, then read a book or watch television. I'll see you tomorrow. Can I breathe now? Yes. I'm sorry I woke you. That's okay. Marianna? Mm-hm? Good night. Good night. Good night. Oh. Hey! What the hell do you guys want? David Fowler? Yeah! You know what time it is? I'm Lieutenant Cranzano, LAPD. This is Sergeant Stone from Houston. She shot her husband. He found out that we were fooling around together. Well, he started beating her up. She grabbed for his .45, and she shot him in the balls. That's terrible. He was lucky. He still got one left. What do you want from me? Just want to ask you a few questions. She's been charged with attempted murder. I may have to go to Houston to testify. They know everything. I mean, everything. He hired a private detective to follow us around. He followed us through a car wash. You gotta be sick to be a private detective. Oh, God! Oh. Agh. Why don't you lie down? Oh. When things start going bad, they just go from bad to worse. I'm shaking so bad, I feel like I'm in an earthquake. You are in an earthquake. I am in an earthquake. Earthquake! David! Let's get out of here! David! Uh-uh. David, relax! What do you mean relax? We're on the 12th floor! Whoa. It's all right. It's over. What about the next one? We gotta go! Go right ahead. I have things to do. You think I'm gonna leave you? Well, maybe just for a while! Listen-- David! I'm no good in disasters! I never was. I'm under control now. Hold your breath. Come and lie down. Take it easy. There you go. All right? Would you like a glass of water? No. Okay. See, That would've been fine if it hadn't been for Texas. Yes. Houston. Of course. Roy. And the earthquake. It must've frightened you. Ah. It scared the sh-- Weren't you afraid? Yes, I was. Oh, I'm so glad. I'm so glad. Hey, how about lying down? Come on. Okay. I'll make a deal with you. I'm gonna put my feet up... if we get one little tremble, I'm getting the hell out of here. Okay? What is it? I don't feel like associating anymore. Can we just talk? Okay? Okay. Been living in California long? About six years. Why? Just curious. Why do you want to know? Well, you know, most patients are inquisitive about their analysts. You've only been here six years, you haven't seen many earthquakes. Are you married? No. Hmm. What made you, uh... decide to become an analyst? My analyst. Do you have to see an analyst to become an analyst? Oh, yes. What's his name? Simon Abrams. How come you never got married? I didn't say I never got married. I'm just not married now. Hmm. Why'd you get a divorce? We didn't, he died. Oh. I'm sorry. Was it long ago? Seven years. That's tough. Look, I don't mind discussing my personal life, but I don't think it's appropriate to go further. I didn't mean to pry. That's understandable. Yeah, but, I mean, you can go too far. You can find out too much about some-- You have about 15 minutes left. Would you like to lie down again? All right. What are you thinking? I just remembered something that happened to me when I was 8. I just busted into the bathroom one day and my mother was taking a bath. How did you feel about that? I was embarrassed. And? Aroused. Aah. Oh. I was convinced that I was never gonna see you again. Yeah. I had a problem. I was in a bad place. Does this little encounter indicate that said problem's now resolved? It's a step in the right direction. Well, you know what I always say: One step in the right direction always deserves another. Is that what you always say? Where you're concerned, always. Thank God, I thought I was paralyzed. I don't know why, but I was suddenly feeling much better. Anyway, Courtney was cleaning up the studio and I went to the market. You can always see interesting women at a market. Mostly a variety of housewives. There's no general rule, but according to the food they buy, their shopping attitude and their sense of direction, you can usually tell the veterans from the rookies. A veteran is organized, purposeful and sticks to a shopping list. A rookie just wanders and improvises. Then there are always a few that you can't categorize. Oh. Then occasionally there's one that really brightens your day. Excuse me. Hi, I'm Sue, the babysitter. She was 20 years old, an art major at Pepperdine. We talked about Henry Moore, Lipshitz, and me. We had a wonderful time. She had the most beautiful breasts I've ever seen. I admit it. David on the prowl, David resurrected, makes me really uncomfortable. Jealous? No, Simon. Just an inability to understand this transformation. I mean, one day, he is a helpless, indecisive impotent child. And the next, he's a billy goat sniffing the wind for sexual sweat. And I don't have the slightest clue as to what caused it. Perhaps you did. Me? Oh, no. For the past week, I've been as dull as dishwater. Brightest thing I've said has been "Good morning." Brightest thing I've thought has been-- Well, that he does have such soulful eyes. No, for sure, not me. I thought maybe it was the earthquake. Shock treatment is not remarkable for its aphrodisiac qualities. Besides, after his initial panic, he seemed more fascinated than afraid. Could he be in some self-limiting depression? Some circular condition that oscillates from the lower depths to the heights of elation. It's not characteristic of his clinical history. He doesn't have that hereditary background. You did something to your hair. Oh, yeah, I changed it a little. How did you feel during the earthquake? Really? Why not? Well, I was tempted to say, "David, move over. "I am not the Rock of Gibraltar, "nor the salt of the earth, "nor the Lord's shining light. Hold me and we'll both feel better." Perhaps you got to him then. Made him feel strong. Urgent, potent, unleashed. If I did, then we have a cure by Extra Sensory Perception. The first on record. I'd keep that notion to myself, or they'll lock you up. Yeah, magic isn't much respected in our profession. Neither is sleeping with your patient. Even if you're in love with him? Then be his lover. Not his doctor. Okay! Okay! Okay, I'm coming! Oh, my God! Hi there. Care to harbor a fugitive for a few days? You cute thing. I thought you were in jail. I'm out on bail. California? I won't tell if you don't. Got your telegram. I didn't send one. I know. You hunk. Mm. David? Hmm? What're you doing? Doing? Uh-- I don't know. What am I doing? Mm. What are you doing? I was just cleaning my oven. I know. Oh, David, that is-- David? Hmm? Oh, hi! Are you okay? Of course. Who's that? That's my sister. What's she doing here? I don't know. What's her name? Hi, I'm Louise. Hi, I'm Enid. Oh. Nice to meet you. Mm. Nice to meet you too. Enid. She looks just like you. My fantasy was full, my reality was empty. I should have known, one divided by two equals one-half. Half a man. Half there. Christ, when will I grow up? And so it went, session after session, week after week, David talking about the women in his life, past and present. Never giving the slightest hint as to what had caused the sudden and dramatic change in his condition. I say to myself, "Stay with your ignorance. Don't try to make sense of it by forcing an explanation." Maybe David has seen some great truth in a mirror that's just not accessible to me and it's liberated him. Be happy for David. But? I just have this feeling that if it's not revealed and resolved then there's the danger it could trigger a relapse. Why don't you ask him? What do you mean? "David, what do you think it was that made you get better?" I don't know. I sense you do. Remember the earthquake the other day? Mm-hm. This thing shook. Door popped open. I don't understand. I could see up your dress. And you think that was it? Don't you think so? I guess it's possible. I know it is. David, I think I should warn you. You may gain a love, but you'll lose an analyst. I think it's worth it. Do we have to leave tomorrow? Well, I have to be in the office at 7:30 on Monday morning. What did you have in mind? Mexico. Oh, God, that's a romantic thought. That's what we should be having, romantic thoughts. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. You didn't let me finish. Because you'll be practical and objectionable. Ha-ha-ha. If you were my 8:00 patient-- I couldn't be. I don't get up till 9:00. If you were, how would you like it if I ran off to Mexico? If you ran off to Mexico with me, I would love it. Oh, David. I would love it too. Can we have two tequila sunrises? Mm-hm. Here's what you do. Get on the phone, call the office, tell 'em, "I found this island with goats and flowers. We just make love, eat the goats and smell flowers. No. Know what your problems is? I know. No sense of adventure. You don't have swah-de-vive. What? Swah-de-vu. No. Joie de vivre. You can't say Houston, I can't say swah-de-vu. We're meant for each other. Listen. You don't know how to take risks. I don't know how to take risks? No, no. You never learned Spanish. I'm fluent in Spanish. You are? Perfect! By the time we get to Acapulco, I can speak Spanish like a native. Listen to this. Que hora? Very good. It's about 9:15. Did I just ask you the time? Mm-hm. Oh. I thought I said, "I love you." Well, it's the thought that matters. I love you too. If I was a young Spaniard-- Well, middle-aged Spaniard and I was in love with this beautiful Spanish lady, and I wanted to ask her to marry me, how would I say it in Spanish? You'd say, "Quieres casarte conmigo?" Yes, I would like to marry you. No. No what? You tell me what. Don't do that. Don't answer my questions with questions. Stop being an analyst. What would you have me be? I would have you be my lady. Can't I be both? No, you can't. Why not? The therapist takes over. Just because I ask you why you want to marry me? Yes. I'm your lady and I'm an analyst. They're both me. I don't think you can separate them or put a premium on one or the other. I don't agree, but that's all right. We'll get married, sleep on it, and discuss it in the morning. You're not gonna take no for an answer? No. Listen to me, my dearest shrink. I am asking you to marry me. Do you hear what I'm saying? I am asking you to marry me. I've never asked anybody in my life. I know. Isn't that some sort of psychiatric breakthrough? Yes. Well, then, don't you think we should settle down a-and have children and live in a Leave it to Beaver house with a white picket fence and everything? Ever see Leave it to Beaver? No. It's a beautiful house, it's perfect for us. Okay, now, why me? Why not you? I asked you first. Oh, come on. It's a very reasonable question. All right, I'll give you that, but I won't give a reasonable answer. We're gonna get married, live in the Leave it to Beaver home, have lots of kids, and you don't ask questions like that. You do, particularly if it's a man like you who never before in his life asked anyone to marry him. You don't think I'm cured. Oh. "Cured" is a word I find very hard to define. When you came to me, you were in serious trouble. Don't you think I'm better? Immensely improved. Well, aren't you immensely optimistic? Yeah, I am, I'm very optimistic. What about "immensely"? Well, I would be "immensely" if you'd get back into analysis. I'll make you a promise if you make me a promise. I'll go back into analysis if you marry me. I'll make you a promise. If you do get back into analysis, I'll watch Leave it to Beaver. Perfect. David and I saw each other steadily for nearly two months. For me, it was the most stimulating, the most original, the most loving two months of my life. And happily, everything that David said and did indicated that he felt the same way. But we both knew that sooner or later he would be compelled to move on. David. Hmm? Do you have a blender? Sorry? - A blender. Oh. Yeah, there must be one around here someplace. I found the top. The bottom must not be far behind. Even if I do find it, you don't have any fresh fruit. You're kidding. I'll go to the store. I'll make us a delicious protein drink. Svetlana. I operate on the premise that honesty is the cornerstone of any meaningful relationship. What are you saying? I'd rather have a Big Mac. Okay, you're killing your body. No. You're killing my body. Hello. I can't come to the phone right now. Please leave your name and a message after the beep. This is Dr. Marianna Solari, your affectionate analyst, with her thought for the day: Although conspicuous by your absence, out of sight has not been out of mind. And after contemplating your future emotional well-being, your considerable talent, and the female population at large, I've come to the inescapable conclusion that you should get back into therapy. If you feel that this suggestion has merit, call Dr. Colin Taft, 321-1321. If you'd like to see me for reasons personal or professional, I'll be at the Old Stand until the 27th. After that I'll be in Switzerland. I don't want you to go to Switzerland. TWA flight 708 to London and Geneva now boarding. What are you doing here? It's the only place where people fall from their farms. David. Hmm. How long are you going? Three weeks. Why? To see my stepson who's in college. And I'm going to lecture. What if I start to hyperventilate? Hold your breath and call Dr. Taft. I'm not gonna call Dr. Taft. If I was taking singing lessons from Beverly Sills, I wouldn't go see Fokker Febleman. I have to go. Don't you want to know who Febleman is? I'd love it if you'd write. What if he's driving your airplane? The Bord du Lac in Zurich. Doctor. Open this on the plane. Thank you. Dr. Taft. Fokker Febleman. Final boarding call for TWA flight 708 for London and Geneva. I never saw him again. About a week later, he called me in Zurich and said he was doing well and working hard. He still hadn't seen Dr. Taft, and I was worried that his recovery might be temporary and that some unexpected trauma might immobilize him again. He jokingly confessed that although the pursuit of new women was still exhilarating and indispensable to his physical and emotional well-being, the effort was beginning to be tiresome. He blamed his sudden loss of energy on middle age and poor circulation. He sounded sweet, and sad, and lonely. He was seeing Agnes again. Well, I guess this is as good a time as any to tell you something. David, I'm getting married. What? I'm getting married. It's crazy, huh? No. Oh, it's crazy. Is he, uh... A good guy, or--? You like him? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, he's great. Great. He's sweet and generous and, ahem... And good in bed and-- Oh, great. And I'm in love with you. Oh. But I need commitment. So do I. Oh. But you can't. I'm working on it. But I want lots of babies. Yeah. On the 21st of December, I received a postcard. Dear Marianne, Santa Claus is coming to town. Why aren't you? I miss you desperately, and if I find you under my tree on Christmas morning, I'll sign on with Dr. Taft. I need you. I can't decide what to buy Fokker Febleman. May I help you? No, thank you. I'm just browsing. It's very pretty. Yes, it is. You shopping for yourself or someone else? Someone else. My mother. You're David Fowler, aren't you? Yes. I love your work. Thank you. There you go, Miss Wainwright. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Can I help you carry those, Miss Wainwright? Yes, you may. And it's Janet. Janet. I'm not far, just right outside. Finished with your shopping? Just about. I've barely started mine. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. So do you have family here? No, just some close friends and some children. Your children? No. Children are so much fun to shop for. They're the best. Do you have any children? No. No, I'm not married. It's right here, the gray Rolls. Oh. Got a boyfriend? Sort of. Sort of? Heh. It's not serious. Oh, good. So anything preventing you from having dinner with me? Probably. But let me think about it. I've been seeing someone for a year, but honestly-- Don't go away. Please, don't leave. Don't go away. What are you--? Don't go away. Look out! Help him! Come on, honey. How is he? Mr. Fowler? Hi. You're gonna be just fine. Oh, my God! Who do I talk to about Mr. Fowler? Oh. Well, there you have it. It's finally over. And, David, these women have walked for you for the very last time. How I wish you were here to enjoy it. Your delight in women was so passionate, so generous, that miraculously we were all transformed, molded and sculpted by your love as if we were soft clay bent to your quiet will, and then set firm in the fires of your passion. With memories as powerful and rich and graceful as the sculpted images you created to beautify the world around us. Goodbye, David. God bless. * What is it That made you run away? * * What, were you afraid You'd feel passé? * * Always the same * The closer you came To love * * Funny how you fought And didn't know * * Everything you thought You wanted so * * Always the same * The closer you came To life * * Once in my arms You were happy * * But while I was singing * What long ago voice Did you hear? * * At the moment * Forever was near * Women have a way Of running too * * Little boys who run away Like you * * It's foolish But then I do it again * * For sometimes * Little boys run away * And grow up * To love someday
