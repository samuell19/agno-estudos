André Polonski, do you wish to take Marie-Claire Muller as your wife? I do. Marie-Claire Muller, do you wish to take André Polonski as your husband? I do. Having answered in the affirmative, by virtue of mutual consent, I declare you bound - or re-bound, if I may say so - by the bonds of matrimony. Would the witnesses please sign? Please exchange rings. They're the same ones. We've laid on a small reception in the main hall. You seem happy anyhow. I am. But it's all for his sake. I'd have gladly stayed the way we were. You won't make me believe that. Why else wait until Guillaume turned 18? I know you like my own daughter. I'm no one's daughter. He seemed the ideal son-in-law, the one who'd take over Muller Chocolate. How naive. Surely he knew Andre was an artist. And what an artist! He was already very weak. He'd been fighting illness for over six months. My father-in-law? Poor man! He was obsessed by his chocolates. He was right to be proud of them. Success like his is rare. I wasn't the ideal son-in-law. It's sad to say but he died before I could disappoint him. He was spared the sorrow of your divorce. As you say. Can I fetch you another? - You're too kind. - You're welcome. I admire him as a pianist but, as a man, he bothers me. You're swayed by your affection for Marie-Claire. You're mistaken. To be honest, I'm glad they're giving it another try. That's just like her. She hates losing. The situation has changed too. Polonski's fame is assured. And Mika's no longer a little girl. She's strong-headed, she'll stand up to him. She's not eighteen this time. You know they've been living together for three years now. My dear Dubois, I'm not partial to gossip. My father gave me this for you. Thank you, young man. What's your name again? Guillaume. Will you seek a career in music too? I have no talent for it. That's such a pity. What do you plan to do? We've always called her Mika. An administration school? No, my father hates the idea. Join us at the factory. You can take over from your stepmother. My stepmother? She's your stepmother now. I can't think of her that way. He wasn't really playing like before. On that recording after Lisbeth died, you can tell he's in mourning. Poor Lisbeth... Bravo for the exhibition of your mother's photos. It's a tribute to her talent. Mika organised everything. I see now how good she was at her job. I agree with Mika. A low-key wedding is better this time. It was Andre's idea too. The first one was so luxurious... There were 500 guests. And look where it got them. So, how's it going? Fine. How about you? If you're happy. I am too. But there are too many people. I think we can slip off soon. Are you two plotting again? I think Mika wants to leave. - Whenever you want. - No, when you want. There's a piano next door. It's totally out of tune. Sorry, I have a favour to ask... For the press... A photo. Just one little photo. You're the devil incarnate. NIGHTCAP Where have they got to? They must be playing a tie-break. Your son's too gallant. Let them have their fun. I'm so glad you were able to take Axel on. It's changed him completely. Nothing ever interested him before. He's found his calling. You'd have done the same for Jeanne. I don't see how. Jeanne's known what she wants for a long time. In any case, he's doing well. His lab chief loves trainees. A little too much. I'm sure Axel can manage. There's no problem there. Here they come. I'll put them in the boot. Afraid of thieves in Switzerland? Victor, I think we can eat at last. You're in no hurry, darlings. Who won? He won't lob hard because I'm a girl. Hurry up, it's 1:15 already. I'll have a salad with a soft-boiled egg and bacon. Today's special is lake fish. I'll have that. Any heartier fare? A rib of beef for two? Okay. - Rare, right? - Yes, very rare. The Coffee's better down here. Maybe but your cigarette spoils it. What's my mum like at work? Not too harsh? Wonderful, a real pro. Everyone respects her. Don't make fun of me. You've never said what you do there. - What does he do? - Experiments. Something practical and useful at last. Toxin surveys, sample analysis. I've become indispensable. Want to see a film tonight? If you like. What's on? I have today's paper. Fancy that! Look what I've found. "Marie-Claire Muller and André Polonski "announce their wedding..." Polonski... Isn't he the one from the clinic? - What clinic? - He's a top pianist. - You must have heard of him. - What clinic? When Jeanne was born. - When I was born? - What of it? You know, Louise, that mix-up they had. There was no mix-up. A mix-up? Are my origins shrouded in mystery? She doesn't know? I've put my foot in it. No, you haven't. There's just nothing to say. Mum always has something to say. Shall I tell you? You bet! Polonski's child was born in the clinic on the same day. His wife - not this one - gave birth while he was performing in Lucerne. Is that right? Anyway... He rushed to the clinic and asked to see his child, before seeing the mother. She was sleeping anyway. The nurse went to the nursery and showed you to him saying, "You have a lovely daughter." Then he went to see his wife - she was awake by then - who told him they had a son. He started kicking up one hell of a fuss. Luckily, your father managed to calm him down. Is that it? How could that happen? Babies have a bracelet with their name. The clinic had run out of bracelets. They wrote the first three letters of your name. Pollet and Polonski start the same. It was dark and the nurse mixed you up, that's all. I might be Polonski's daughter... It's just like Life is a Long, Quiet River. Oh, please, you can't swap a boy for a girl! Really? You father sorted it all out. I never knew. Mum, just think, he's a pianist like me. If Mr Polonski is your father, I'm not your mother. And you're still studying to be a pianist, remember. I'm sorry, mum. And your father was an artist too. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. I forgive you, dear. - Can I have a cigarette? - Of course. Why did I mention all that? Never mind, the incident's over. In fact, there never even was one. - Your father will be furious. - So don't tell him. I need to go into town. Can I take the paper? Of course, dear. Don't go dressed like that. Besides, you said you'd practice every day, even on a Sunday. See you later? Yes, I'll call you. Want me to drive you home? Do I have a choice? Can I take the car keys now? Yes, they're in my pocket. The papers are in the glove-box. - That's a pretty dress. - You bought it. I did? You have corpses on Sundays too? Life goes on. Paradoxically, they can't wait. This Jewish gold business resurfaces every year. - Before elections. - What's the use? A prosecutor, a homosexual and from Geneva... Excuse me. - Are you all right? - Yes. Don't worry. You're kind. Come on. - I'll take your chocolate up. - I'll do it. Out of the question. I see to the chocolate here. I hope you've made less today. I had to leave half. I noticed. Do you mind me playing? - Is this disturbing you? - Yes. I'm sorry. What's that? - The doorbell. - Expecting someone? Was that the doorbell? I'll go. Good evening. I'd like to see Mr Polonski. Do you have an appointment? Yes... Well, no, but he knows me. I'll go and see. What's your name? Jeanne Pollet. Tell him "from the clinic". All right. He doesn't know you. Sorry but I can't help that. What is it you want? He does know me. I'll explain to him. Oh, no! Mika! I've seen you before, young lady. You were at the gallery. You were standing outside. What brings you here? Sorry to burst in like this but I absolutely had to come. I could well be your daughter. My daughter? You're out of your mind! No, listen to me, please. I was the baby you saw at the clinic. Of course... I remember that business. But I never had a daughter. Some idiot of a nurse... Yes, I know. What if they switched us? They didn't. Your father explained. A marvellous man. How is he? - He's dead. - I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. So it was you? I kissed you that day. Will you have a drink with us? I'd like that. You were delightful. You still are but I wouldn't have known you. What will you have? Fruit juice, white wine, whisky? Fruit juice, please. Can you get it, Guillaume? No, Guillaume dear, in the kitchen. So what do you do? I'm doing the Budapest competition. You're a pianist? That's incredible! Let's say, I play the piano. I was on the jury two years ago. Yes, I know. It's tough. What are you playing? A Bach fugue and prelude, a Chopin study... They're obligatory. Liszt is harder. I've chosen Funérailles. That's a good choice. But it's full of traps. You mustn't only play it like a funeral march. If you can pull it off, you'll triumph. It's impressive in any case. And you mustn't try to play it like some virtuoso. I'd like to see how you manage. - Pineapple juice. - Thank you. - Come on, show me. - Dad! The guests will be here soon. What? That's right. It is a little late. Listen... Your name's Jeanne? Jeanne, can you come back tomorrow? Yes, of course. Thank you. - Call me first. - I don't want to disturb you. Not at all, I'll look forward it. Drink up now. Something to drink, Mika? No, thank you, dear. We'll drink enough later. By the way, would you like to see the self-portraits we have of Lisbeth? Of course. Can we go UP? Yes, go ahead. Come on then. You live in Lausanne? Yes, Chemin Du Languedoc. - Do you believe her? - I believe her. What she's saying is true. You're my son and Lisbeth's. You weren't switched. - Did you check? - Of course. Her father gave me a thorough demonstration. It's odd she's a pianist. If musical talent was hereditary, we'd know. Don't be ridiculous. You welcomed her like one of the family. No, it's not that. She reminded me of Lisbeth. You think they look alike? No, she just reminded me of those days. We were so happy then. You weren't after? After too... How did she fall asleep at the wheel? It wasn't suicide, you know. I don't know. We'll never know. That's the thing I can't stand. She was beautiful, wasn't she? A real woman. A true woman, if you see what I mean. I could understand André. I adored her too. It may sound odd but we were good friends. Almost like sisters. Sisters aren't always friends. You're probably right but we loved each other. I'm so clumsy! I'll get a towel from the bathroom. Damn, what an idiot! You'll ruin your handkerchief! I'm always replacing things I break. It would leave a nasty stain on a carpet. What a horrible mess! I'll wash your handkerchief. Please, it's nothing. Don't be silly. We'll have it washed for when you come back. You needn't bother. - I must make amends. - I'm sorry. You must be joking! I'm the guilty one, not you. I'll put all this in the kitchen. Have you got the stopper? For the flask. I left it behind. I'll get it. On the chest. Have you found it? Here, let me. You're a darling. I can't believe how clumsy I am. It happens to me too... The door. André, can you go? My hands are full. He invited musician friends, on a Sunday, the staff's day off. Are all pianists so forgetful? I forget things but I'm not a good enough pianist yet. Excuse me, I'm hopeless. No chocolate tonight, I spilled the lot. Miss Pollet, a pianist. We met at the Conservatoire. You're Dr Pollet's daughter. Your father was a doctor? No, mother's the doctor. She runs the forensic science lab. A very important lady... - Can you show Jeanne out? - I'll get my shoes. Call me tomorrow. I certainly won't forget. Thank you. See you tomorrow, dear. With a clean handkerchief. Here's our number. Let's have a drink before dinner. I'd forgotten it was Sunday. But we'll be all right. So, are you happy? I never imagined I could meet him. Now I'm invited to play, I'm more than happy. - This mix-up... - What about it? You believe you're his daughter? Of course not! I'm my parents' daughter. You never believed it for a second. Of course not. I just wondered if you... Funny we have the same birthday. See you tomorrow perhaps. Perhaps. It depends what time. Can I have some water? Right away. What a sight! Thanks. Your mother really thinks we're at the movies? Of course. She's pretty old-fashioned, you know. You could tell her. That you're banging me? I hate it when you get vulgar! If a woman spilled a flask of chocolate on purpose, what would you think? Was it really on purpose? - She knew you could see her? - No. - I saw her reflection. - Not so simple. In any case, I'm sure. She opened the flask and knocked it over. What do you think? I've no idea. I'm not Hercule Poirot. You've got a one-track mind. Was the chocolate for her? No, someone else. She didn't want them to drink it. Okay, but why? Why? How should I know? To stop them putting on weight. You're impossible... Or deprive them of a treat. With a mind like that, you won't last long at the lab. There's only one solution: the chocolate was poison. Maybe you're going a bit too far. Who made the chocolate? I don't know. What's the matter? Look, I stained it with the stuff. - Messy, aren't you? - Oh, come on... Can you analyse it? Hold on, I've only been doing the job for two weeks. Don't look at me like that. I'll try but I'm not sure. Can you do it in the morning? I have to work fast too? I'll try to do it as soon, as fast and as well as possible. I'll call you. No, I'll call you once I've finished. You weren't too bored? Not at all. It was delicious. I'm going to bed, I'm stuffed. Shall I make more chocolate? No, Mika, really. I don't know where I'd put it. - Good night, dad. - Good night, son. I need water. How about you? Excellent idea. Just what I needed. What's that? I'm practising for tomorrow. Liszt's Funérailles. I haven't played it in ten years. Well, not so long. It's what that girl's playing. I like her a lot. She's pretty and lively. And very intelligent too. An awkward situation. She handled it admirably. I'll get it, Marielle! Why aren't you calling my mobile? Oh, come on... Found anything? Plenty of benzodiazepine. What's that? It helps you sleep. And can it... Can you die of it? You don't waste time. You can die of anything. You'd need one hell of a dose. Is there a lot? I haven't checked the concentration. I set fire to your sweater. Luckily, I was alone. They'd have thrown me out. You learn by your mistakes. You ruined my sweater. I'm kidding, I couldn't care less about the thing. What was that stuff again? Benzodiazepine. You know what Rohypnol is? The rape drug. I read about it. You give some to a girl on the sly. That's easy, it dissolves in alcohol. You rape her and she can't remember a thing afterwards, even if it wakes her up. She never knows she's been raped. No kidding! I hope you haven't tried that stuff on me. Are you sure that's what the stuff is? Not one hundred percent. But it's similar. Look, I've got to go. But if you want my opinion, forget the whole thing. Benzodiazepine. The 1999 accounts are approved. That's all then. Excuse me but, first of all, I'd like to raise a couple of brief points. Go ahead, Patou. Thank you. Firstly, I'd like to stress the success of what I call the "lactoline". An original way of bringing milk directly from the farm to the factory. Our milk is incomparably fresh and it saves us time and money. What's the problem? I'm coming to that. I observe that, in 1999, sales of the drinking chocolate invented by your father show the only rise. You agree with me there? Carry on, please. Other sales are stationary for the fourth year in a row. And that's despite end-of-year sales - exceptional, of course - that our industry benefited from. But new centuries are a rarity and I have great fears for next year. Let's face the facts: the wide range of non-chocolate products show disappointing results and we must learn from this. For our customers, Muller means chocolate - and nothing else. - That's in your report. It's wise not to lose sight of that. I'd also like to mention the public relations and sponsoring budget. Given the poor returns, it should be re-evaluated. My dear, you can't reject everything related to childhood. People notice and that's bad for us. It's our stock in trade. Schools, sports clubs, organisations... You refuse to help any of them. It would cost a lot less than your centres. I'll use my money as I see fit. It's our money too, in a way. I know that chocolate secretes endorphines and so on and so forth. That's no reason to subsidise only anti-pain centres, twelve of them to boot, along with the exhibition of photos by Lisbeth Polonski that I'm not criticising at all. I should hope not! It's simple enough: people shouldn't suffer. Children suffer too. You could just offer them chocolates. Your centres bring in nothing in advertising terms and cost us a fortune. I won't touch them. Please don't insist. However, I think we need to modernise our packaging. The study results will soon be available. Keeping up appearances is all that counts. End of meeting. Thank God that's over. I fixed that appointment. Very good, thank you. Dufreigne... Yes? Forgive my insisting like this but I really must see you. Of course, Patou. Without fail? - I promise. - I'm counting on you. Good-bye, dear, have a nice evening. Thank you, Patou, you too. Old papa Dufreigne is getting to be a pain. My appointment? At half past. In twenty-five minutes. Your appointment, doctor. She's in your office. Tell Dr Vernay to take over until six. - Very good. - I'll call in on him. Dr Pollet? I'm Marie-Claire Polonski. Thank you for seeing me. I'm here about Jeanne. Jeanne? Yes. You probably know she came to see us yesterday. Yes. She didn't bother you? Not at all. It was a surprise but it was a pleasure to get to know her. Sit down, please. Would you like some tea? Well, I wouldn't say no. Nathalie, could you bring some tea, please? Two cups. And don't forget the milk. You can leave after. You didn't forget the milk? Is there anything I can do to help Jeanne? She asked for help? But I believe everyone needs help. - Milk? - No milk or sugar, thank you. She doesn't need help. She just needs to grow up. She could do with a father. She told us he was dead. She seemed upset about what happened at the clinic. My husband too, in fact. Could she be his daughter? On an emotional level, I'm sure she isn't. But, on a professional level, I know unlikely situations are sometimes real. So you have doubts? No, just a scientific mind. I suppose you must have checked blood groups and so on... My blood group matches your husband's. Your husband had the same group as Mrs Polonski... as mine. You all have the same blood group. So there's some doubt. Not for us. There may have been for our gynaecologists. The blood groups are in the files. You left it at that? Surely your lab could have helped. Things aren't that simple. I didn't have this lab back then. Above all, what you suggest is illegal. Only a judge can ask for such tests. My husband and I had no doubts, I promise you. Is that why you came? No, not at all. André has no doubts either. He was pleased to meet Jeanne. So was I. I was glad that she came to call. Wonderful. Would you like more tea? No, thank you. I've taken up enough of your time. I was just worried about Jeanne. She seemed bothered by it. It's terrible, I'm always meddling. It's very kind of you. You have wonderful facilities. Are you State financed? Partly. We have contracts with private bodies for research. Really? I could finance you then? Yes but I don't see what research Muller Chocolate could require from a crime lab. There's no obvious link but if you need anything, let me know. Don't worry about Jeanne. She manages very well alone. And she has her mother. Your tempo's better. I played it faster. That's not the problem. Did you feel like a good pianist? - Not at all. - That's okay then. - Have you heard Arrau's recording? - I don't think so. It's surprising, nothing like a funeral march. It is, but in a subtle way. You'll notice if you listen again. Don't try to copy it, it would be a disaster. I play it very badly. Not at all. You're not playing the right way. There's a percussive side to Liszt. Supple wrists and finger control have to be forgotten. Try to keep your wrist as hard as steel. Control has to come from the arm and forearm. You understand everything. Well, a fair share of control... It works for Bartok, Prokofiev or Stravinsky. Petrushka is astounding on the piano. Back to work. Your turn now. Why do you always make it the day before? It's better that way, Marguerite. That's the secret. A convent mother superior found it out. Why? The lactic ferments have time to develop. If it's all chemistry then... I'll make the Aztecs' chocolate soon, with turmeric, ginger, cinnamon... - Let me. - Heavens, no! That's better. The final chord must be more terse, clear and final. Release the pedal and strike it. I'm not interrupting you? I've made the chocolate. We've finished for the day. And we've done some good work, haven't we? That's not up to me to say. How can I thank you? That's easy. Work on all this and play it for me tomorrow. Meanwhile, sample Mika's chocolate, the world's eighth wonder. Where's Guillaume? He isn't in his room. He went out around three. Just after Jeanne called. Yes, I called around three. He's enjoying his holidays. What's he studying? Ancient languages this year. I hope it lasts. It Will. Here, Jeanne. I met your mother this afternoon. You saw my mother? I was very impressed. What an intelligent woman. And so composed too. She adores you. You're lucky. How come you saw my mother? Well, I asked for an appointment. You've unsettled us a little. Hasn't she, Andre? It was a surprise. A pleasant one. I think it's upset Guillaume a great deal. I'm sure that's why he's out. That's ridiculous. I know but that's how it is. Drink up before it gets cold. Your mother is as sure as André about what you told us. You learnt about it recently? It must have been a shock. Not particularly. It was the coincidence mainly. The fact that I'm a pianist too. It is amusing. What do you think? Delicious. I'll make some every time. Get to work. See you tomorrow. I see André's using your first name now. May I do the same? Mrs Polonski, I'd be honoured. Then you must call me Mika. Good-bye, my dear. Finished your act, have you? We were all wondering where you were. Sure... The little family's worried about me now? I wanted to see you. Sure... What is it you're after? - Nothing... - You're pathetic when you try to look like my mother. And when you try to play like dad. Listen, stupid. Your chocolate was drugged yesterday. - Are you crazy? - No. - I swear it's true. - How do you know? Through my mum's lab. Your mother handled it? No, my boyfriend's a trainee there and he ran the tests. What tests? On what? I'd splashed my sweater with it. This is crazy! Why on earth did you run the tests? I saw your stepmother spill the chocolate on purpose. Mika? That proves it, you really are crazy. She made the chocolate herself. She always does. She'd never let anyone else do it. So? You're trying to say she drugged it? I'm just telling you what I saw. That's ridiculous. I mean, why would she do it? 80, according to you, she drugged my hot chocolate and then spilled it to make sure I wouldn't drink it? There's only one explanation: you're out of your mind. Believe what you want. I've warned you, my conscience is clear. I've had all I can take of the Polonski family! Wait! Why would she hurt me? She's got my father back now, she's happy. How did your mother die? She fell asleep at the wheel. You've seen the road up here. It was fatal. - Did they do an autopsy? - Yes. Maybe my mother did it. I don't know. They found sleeping pills and alcohol. It was my tenth birthday. My father performed that afternoon. When we came back here for dinner... You were living here? Isn't it the Mullers' house? We had no fixed abode. We mostly lived in hotels. Mika invited us to live here when we were in Switzerland. She said that the pianos got bored without dad. Not only the pianos, I'd say. She'd left a beautiful bicycle in my room. I fell when I ran back downstairs to thank her. I really sprained my ankle. I couldn't even use the bicycle. After dinner, mother had a small cognac. That was a habit: every evening after dinner, a small glass of cognac. Then we realised that dad was out of sleeping pills. That was a disaster because dad can't sleep without pills. He's hooked on them. So mum decided to drive into town for some. She went off the edge of the road. Was she taking sleeping pills too? No, never. That's what no one could understand. Dad wouldn't understand if you never came back. You don't know what you want. I can't say yet. I want to work with him, that's true. I need to think it over. Take care of yourself. You'll have to get some more. It's my last one. Don't worry, I'll go tomorrow. It's all planned. I need some aspirin too. I really enjoyed my session with Jeanne today. Know what? She makes me young again. I noticed. Does she play well? She could, without the bad habits that her idiotic teachers have given her. She's lucky she's met you. Absolutely. Tomorrow, I'll see if she's understood what I said. I'm reserving my opinion for now. Won't Guillaume be jealous? Jealous? Why would he be jealous of a student? She didn't come as a student. That old business. Think it's still bothering him? What about her? She never mentioned it. She could be my daughter. I'd like to have a daughter. What if we tried to have one? Tonight? We can start tonight. No, not tonight, silly. Why not? You'll doze off on the job. - I won't. - You will. You're always in a rush to take your pills. Tomorrow then. Tomorrow, if you take your sleeping pill afterwards. You're beautiful and reasonable too. True, I am starting to doze off. I'm like a kid, aren't I? Not always. Carry on reading, it doesn't bother me. No, you're sweet, but I'm sleepy too. Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Sleep well at least. If you want to make her work, shouldn't she spend a few days here? Just a second... I need to wake up! I'm sorry, the milk was boiling over. Forgive me, doctor. It's Mika Muller here. My husband is so impressed by your daughter's talents... I don't know what to say. Jeanne isn't up yet. I'm sure she'll be flattered by your husband's opinion but I don't know her plans... That doesn't matter. She's coming to see my husband. If she wants to stay, we'll have a room ready. Board and lodging along with the music. It will be a very great pleasure for us. - You look pale. - I didn't sleep well. Breakfast is ready. Do you ever relax? I was up. What else could I do? Make toast if you want. That was Mrs Muller. - They've invited you to stay. - Really? Her husband likes the way you play and wants to coach you a little. He has to go to Germany next week. Yes, I know... What did you say? That I'd tell you but I didn't know your plans. What do you think? You're old enough to decide. I've no idea. But I feel like accepting. That's that then. You don't seem pleased. I'm not an unnatural mother. I'm glad André Polonski thinks you're talented. Very glad. But they want to monopolise you and you're getting all worked up. You can't manage two days without your daughter? Pretentious thing! I hardly ever see you anyway. You're always with Axel, playing tennis... or seeing movies. I want to go. Go but remember, you're not Polonski's daughter. - That's all over. - I'm not so sure. I know you. I made you. What's that tone? I'll use the tone I choose. I'll spend two days with them. I'll never stop you from doing what you want. But your father isn't your father. Polonski, you mean? I didn't say that? No, you didn't. You said, "Your father isn't your father." Polonski isn't your father nor was my husband. You're telling me this now? So who is my father? Jean asked me never to tell you. I didn't agree but I promised. I didn't agree so now you know. Jean was sterile. No doubt about it. We had to face the truth. I considered adopting... But your father chose. He begged me to try insemination. It worked straight away. There you go. You're my daughter and Jean loved you. Don't go looking for another father. Sperm straws, was it? He was terrified you'd hold it against him. He didn't want people thinking he was impotent, which he wasn't. Even the clinic didn't know. It's been hell keeping quiet. I've felt so dishonest with you. Now I feel dishonest with him. Maybe I shouldn't have told you. You've been keeping a lot from me. It'll do me good to get away. I'm going, mum. Don't worry but I'm going. What are you doing? Gathering snails. - Snails? What for? - To eat. It's the season. We have a guest today. Your little twin. Jeanne, your father's student. Really? - Do you mind? - Not at all. Not at all. Mr Dufreigne, please. It's Mrs Muller. Patou, it's Mika. Yes, me too. Listen, if I came by on Sunday, would that suit you? In the afternoon? Perfect. I'm delighted. We'll get everything sorted out. Take care, Patou. Stupid old fart! You don't look too happy about this. It's not that. Don't ask me anything, okay. Shit! I'm doing you a big favour. It's no fun, driving you up here. I'd rather spend two days with you. Your mother will be mad at me. Did you see her at work? Yes, briefly. How was she? Just like you. She was sulking. What's up? Have you fallen out? Don't ask. She's been a bit heavy-handed. Oh, come on, she's wonderful! Where is this place? Berchtesgaden? You're an angel. I don't know what you're up to, but if you want to return to civilisation, give me a buzz. Jeanne, welcome. Let's get to work. No, you're not there yet. You're trying too hard and it's obvious. You're loosening up. It was better before. Sorry, I don't think I can. Don't talk rubbish. Like this. - Don't you feel well? - I'm fine. This isn't natural for me. It isn't for anyone. It's all concentration and hard work. So concentrate and work hard. Imagine the sound you want and make it. There, much better. Mika says that lunch is ready. Marguerite's leaving early today. Stop right there. Time to eat! I hope you're hungry. All true musicians have one thing in common. They love their food. You don't regret coming to work? No, not at all. Actually, I'm glad to be able to get away for a while. Did your mother object? Not exactly, no. Put it on the table, we'll serve ourselves. I'll get the side dishes. I'll help you. I'll take the vegetables. Clean the sauceboat, there's a splash on it. You can go straight after. You angel. I haven't seen Joseph in ages. Dessert's in the fridge. Fine, don't worry. Do you know Britten's piano concerto? I think I heard it once. Not one of his best but truly fascinating for a pianist. The whole piano part requires you to brush over the notes. It's the exact opposite of Funérailles. Nothing is ever stressed. And yet the piano part structures the whole piece. Have some meat while it's hot. It isn't played often, because of its qualities. It's thrown plenty of colleagues. Have you ever played it? Once or twice but I'm like the others. It's a lot of hard work for an unsatisfactory result. You should try it. Your touch would suit it. I have other problems. - You've fought with your mother. - Why? Because. I'm sure you've fought with her. Guillaume, please. You're being tactless. I hope it isn't true. Your mother's a wonderful woman. I don't want to talk about it. - Let's talk about Mozart. - André, please... Jeanne, listen to me. You never really fall out with your parents. I was adopted. What's going on? Everyone knows. I never knew my real parents. But I had other parents who gave me their name and love. I was rebellious at times, like any girl, to assert my personality. Especially alone with father. But I realise now that we never really fought. That was impossible. You understand? - Was it good? - Delicious. You can tell Marguerite. Who wants coffee? - Jeanne? - No thanks, not for me. Guillaume, can you help me? - Let me help. - Certainly not! We'll have it in the lounge. Whatever you want. Why didn't you try the Haskill competition? I wasn't ready. Exactly... The dishes can wait. Can you grind the coffee? Is Jeanne like Lisbeth? My mother? No. Well, maybe a little. I think she's in love with you. Well I'm not. Pity, you'd make a nice couple. What? Her father's dead, your mother too. What of it? I want everyone to be happy. You have some funny ideas. Oh my God! I'm so sorry! Sit down on the chair. You poor thing. - Hold on, my shawl. - Jesus... I'm really sorry. I can't believe I'm this clumsy. I'm really sorry. Stay here, I'll get a bandage. Just a second. Put this on it for now. I'll be right back. Here we are. A greased bandage for burns and analgesic cream... I feel better. It's stinging less. It isn't serious but it still needs bandaging. Like a real professional. I wanted to be a nurse once. What's going on? I wanted a glass of water. I've been clumsy again. I tipped boiling water over his foot. Look at this bandage. Brilliant! - Does it hurt? - Not now. - I'm terrible. - You didn't do it on purpose. - You wanted some water? - For André. I'll take it to him. Can you walk? Of course. She does nothing by halves. Shut up. Don't talk rubbish. You've scalded your foot? - It was my fault. - He didn't move his foot. It's no big deal. I'll lie down in my room. Can you manage? I'm okay. I want to watch the TV for a bit. I can manage. Will smoked salmon and blintzes be okay for dinner? My favourite. - Guillaume? Smoked salmon? - Wonderful. I'll go into town for it. Can I take Jeanne? Jeanne's not here to shop but to learn to play the piano. Back to work, young lady. These yoghurts have bright colours. Aren't there any chemical flavourings in them? No, we make nature-identical flavourings. What do we mean by that? They're flavourings just like natural ones, using the same molecules as nature but instead of nature making them, a chemist made these molecules. I've found some Danish salmon and a bottle of aquavit for those who like it. Is Guillaume upstairs? We haven't seen him. Jeanne's playing well. I'm sure she is. Are you okay, sweetheart? Of course, Mika. It's nothing. I've found two new tapes for you. Lang's Secret Beyond the Door and Renoir's La Nuit Du Carrefour. Brilliant. I'm happy then. You'll ruin your eyes. I'll call you down for dinner. Let me help you. That's kind of you. You're hardly limping anymore. It still hurts but I'll be fine tomorrow. Jeanne's a good pianist. We had a great session today. I heard you upstairs. Have you enjoyed your holidays, son? I don't do much to tire myself. You can say that again. Mika found me two great tapes. So you'll forgive her. At that rate, she can scald my foot every day. What's so funny? You. - Why? - We love you. Where's Jeanne? She insisted on doing the dishes. The machine's still broken. And you let her? She wanted to. There are only four plates plus the cutlery. Want your chocolate? Yes, please. You too, Guillaume? No, Mika, I'll have coffee tonight. Well I never! Get yourself a cup then. I only brought one for Jeanne. I wait on you hand and foot. I could have come and fetched it. I'm exhausted. I'm going to abandon you but feel free to carry on if you want. Mika and Guillaume won't mind. Not at all. Can I have my Rohypnol? What? My Rohypnol, sweetheart. Oh my God, I completely forgot! I was so upset about scalding his foot. I even forgot the prescription. What are we going to do? I'll pop into town, what else? No, don't go out now. I can go if you want. Would you? That's kind. But you don't know my car. It's okay, I won a rally last year. There's a prescription? I'll fetch it. Drink your coffee, it'll perk you up. You take Rohypnol? Yes but they're banning it soon. I don't know what I'll do. I'll come with you. There's no need. I want to. You're really very kind, Jeanne. The night pharmacy's at the station. I'm going with her. I know it. With your foot? I'm not fatally wounded. And Jeanne's driving. I'd prefer him to go with her. If last time... What? Nothing. Drive safely, I'm in no rush. See you later. She left her coffee. No, she drank it. It's Guillaume's then. Why didn't he want chocolate? They've gone. She seems to drive well. She does everything well. She must have her faults like all of us. She knows what she wants. She'll get it. She's gifted and stubborn. When I look at Guillaume, idling around with no ambition... He's young. Give him time. At eighteen, children start to disappoint you. That's rubbish. You handle it well. I love this. What are you doing? What are you doing? The machine's not working. Why are you washing the cups? To clean them. You know that... What are you doing, Mika? You can see. Yes, I can see. And on the night Lisbeth died, you washed the glasses. Yes, I washed the glasses. I washed the glasses. - What's got into you? - Look at me. My God! What's her mother's number? It's in our address book. Why did you switch our cups? I thought Mika put something in yours. See, you believe me. Hello, Doctor Pollet? It's André Polonski. I'm calling about Jeanne. I can't explain but she's in danger. Call her mobile. She's in our car. Tell her to stop and wait. I'll explain later. Here's my number... 6161007. Come here. Come here. I have a knack for doing wrong. Look out! Sorry, I feel as if I'm going all numb... It's wrong when I pervert good. The more violent it is, the more it appears as good. I give, I give and I can never ask. I didn't even ask to live. You received life like everyone else. You can't deny that. I don't understand. I never understand when you speak. I know what I am. I'm nothing. So... What have you done to them? Tell me what you've done. You know how I cherish Guillaume. You should tell him. Guillaume's like me and we're not like you. My mother never thought I was a genius. I'm just a hanger-on. You don't realise how much you've helped me. Thanks to you I... I know, I help everyone. I helped Lisbeth too. But you adored Lisbeth... I let her do what she wanted. I only put Rohypnol in her cognac. Why did you do it? You loved her... That makes no difference. Instead of loving, I say, "I love you," and people believe me. I have real power in my mind. I calculate everything. It's in God's hands... I think I need to feel tired occasionally. You understand? Why am I telling you all this? What have you done to them? Who? The children. Nothing. Why would I do anything to them? I put Rohypnol in the coffee. Are you angry? What a question! Are you angry? You fool everyone. Some people fool themselves. Oh my God! They're dead. They're dead? No, your luck ran out this time. Just damage to the car. They're not hurt. They're at the police station with Jeanne's mother. They'll be coming back soon.
