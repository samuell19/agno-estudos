- Woo-hoo-hoo! - Yippee! There's nothing like a sleigh ride! How are we doing, Coach Gym Dandy? Test flight 247,389 is looking groovy. Isn't it fun? Yes, indeedy! This can't be right! - My! Oh, my! - Oh, my goodness! - What's going on? - What's going on here? Oh, my goodness! This won't do at all. We didn't even have presents on the sleigh! Hmm. You're absolutely right. This is really very serious. We must conduct a full investigation! I'll go back to the Legend and Lore Lab to make sure Gym Dandy's magic-ometer is syncing with Santa's Christmas Magic Meter, check the levels of Christmas Cheer, and try to improve the flight formula! Is that all? I'll work with Coach Gym Dandy to check on the reindeer. Absolutely, Haley! Gotta keep at it till our good is our better and our better is our best! And I'll have maintenance check the sleigh! All right. Sounds like a game plan. Oh! Looks like I'm late for nightly reports. I'm sure you'll find a way. - We're on it. - Carry on, Santa. - We've got it from here. - Let's get to it, everybody! Do you think we might actually need more reindeer? It sounds like we are going to need Tinsel and Timber's help. They have a front-row seat to get information on the reindeer. Righty, right! They should be waiting to talk to Santa right now. I'll see if I can speak with them directly. Hup two, Elves. Let's get to it! - We're on it! Aren't we, team? - Good luck! The Spirit of Christmas. - Failure is not an option! - Everyone follow me! I know what I'm doing! Santa would like to thank Scout Elf Tinsel and Scout Elf Timber for their nightly report. He will now see Scout Elf Joy Sugar Cookie. We're headed there now, Newsey! Bye! Good luck! I can't believe we got such a cool mission! I guess it's-- All in a day's work for Santa Claus? Absolutely! - Want to race? - You bet! Get ready! Get set!

I am! I am! I love-- Gingerbread houses! No! I was going to say Elf on the Shelf. Isn't that a given? What are these? These are pretty. Those look like your dad's grandmother's, your Great Grandma Leena's. Hey, guys! Look at this! It's a book! Sweet! - Yeah! - Wow! I think it's an old journal. That must be like a million years old. How cute! It says, "Bob's Hardware Store." And there's a baby! Maybe one of your great uncles? And what is this? Is that a little girl standing in the forest? But there's something small right there. It looks like a reindeer. And over there. There's another one. And there's another one! Oh, my goodness! They're everywhere! Well, your great grandma did grow up on a reindeer farm. But these are tiny! - Hey, guys! - Dad! - I need a little... - Coming! Coming! - Help... please? - Careful! I got it! No, wait. I don't got it. Hold it! ♪ We got a Christmas tree! ♪ ♪ We got a Christmas tree! ♪ ♪ It was free! We got a Christmas tree! ♪ Phew! That was tough! Thanks, guys! Dad, look what we found! Yeah! Look! Look! I think it belonged to your grandma. There's a bunch of little reindeer. Well, let's take a look. Huh. What do we have here? Yeah, this does look like my mummi's drawings. She was a fabulous artist in Finland, before she moved to the States. In fact, when she was about your age-- - Dad! - Dad! Oh, all right, all right. I remember this. Yeah, she used to tell my mom about these tiny deer using a song. I used to know this by heart. Let me see. ♪ There was a little girl From Lapland ♪ ♪ Who went to do her chores ♪ ♪ And in the forest There were reindeer ♪ ♪ She hadn't seen before ♪ ♪ She called them pikku deer ♪ ♪ In Finland that means small ♪ ♪ And when she sang They came and played ♪ ♪ She loved them, one and all ♪ ♪ She fed them Salmiakki A salty licorice ♪ ♪ They liked it So they licked and licked ♪ ♪ And licked and licked And licked ♪ ♪ On bitter, chilly nights ♪ ♪ She cracked the window Just a bit ♪ ♪ And thousands would Curl up with her ♪ ♪ Till morning When they'd split ♪ ♪ And then there came the war In November '39 ♪ ♪ She had to leave the reindeer And the war behind ♪ ♪ She did all that she could ♪ ♪ But their numbers Dwindled quick ♪ ♪ She wrote to Joulupukki ♪ ♪ You know him as St. Nick ♪ ♪ "Will you take my reindeer?" She pleaded as she wrote ♪ ♪ "I know that you Can rescue them ♪ ♪ That's why I wrote this note" ♪ ♪ According to the legend My Grandma Mummi told ♪ ♪ Santa Claus did save them ♪ ♪ And together They'll grow old ♪ Well, what happened to the tiny reindeer at the North Pole? I don't know. I'm sure the reindeer are very happy at the North Pole. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I bet they are pets for all the elves, like Tinsel and Timber over there. You kids need to get ready for bed. And, Benjamin, that means brushing your teeth. How are the pikku deer? Do you have one? What's its name? Do they miss Great Grandma Leena? What do they eat? Is it magical? How big are they? Yeah, how big? Do they have other jobs at the North Pole? Oh, good question! What kind of jobs? Benjamin, skedaddle! Go on! Scoot! Hurry! We gotta go! Tell them we said hi! Oh, and we love you so much! - Woo-hoo! - Woo-hoo! - Right on time! - Stuck the landing! I wonder what everyone else is up to. - Time to check in! - Hey, Timber! Hey, Tinsel! Hey! Welcome back! Hup! Hup! Come on! Come on, Elves! General, are you sure all of the Scout Elves have reported in on schedule thus far? Yes, yes. Yes, I am. Not... a... one is unaccounted for, Newsey. Good to know, since so many humans think the elves don't make it back to the North Pole every night when their elf lands in the same spot as the day before. That's so silly! - Well, that's just farcical. - Absurd! - No, hilarious! - Ridiculous! No, waggish! Preposterous! Woo-hoooo! Woo-hoo! I mean, it's no different than having a favorite chair! Or reading the same bedtime story every night. Humans. What can you do? We love 'em though, right? We wouldn't even have a job without humans! - Of course we move around. - Humans are the best! Hi, guys! Hi, Timber! Hi, Tinsel! Any luck with your assignment out there? Yes, they found the journal! We got our family talking about the old reindeer farm! Any talk of Santa's original eight magical reindeer? No, not a word. Oh, Timber, the kids did ask if the pikku deer had any other jobs at the North Pole, remember? Oh, yeah! Could they do something to help? That's a novel idea! So, do you think it's worth exploring? I think we probably should. We must press forward before conditions get any worse. That would be worse than burnt Christmas cookies! Terrible! Whoa! Whoa! Steady! Steady! Look out! Good heavens! Look out! - No! - Incoming! Ahh! - Is everyone okay? - That was a close one! - I hope everybody's okay! - I almost lost my hat! I'm reporting for duty, sir! Test flights still not yielding optimal results, Santa? I'm afraid not. It's quite regrettable. We've had no luck finding a better Christmas magic formula. Our attempts have been calamitous. I'm still tracking a below average acceleration rate on the magic-ometer. - I had no idea it was this bad. - Me, neither. Let's break for some cinnamon cider and marshmallow treats. Santa, what is really going on? I don't think there is any problem with belief out there. Yeah, we've seen plenty! It really comes down to one thing. You see, the particular Christmas Spirit ingredient I need for this type of Christmas magic is running very low. And what is that? Love. Love for others. Love for one another. The world just needs a little old-fashioned L-O-V-E. Well, a few more reindeer couldn't hurt either, given the data I've seen. Love? Love, you say? Yes, Elf Joe. It's the one element that we can't seem to collect enough of. That's it! That's it! By golly, that's it! - What's it? - What's with all the jolly? - What's up with him? - Any idea why he's so animated? Tinsel, you and Timber work with Newsey to see what you can do to get human kids involved, especially those Peura kids! - On it! - Okay! Haley, you and Gym Dandy talk to the reindeer to see if they'd be willing to volunteer. General, you come with me! We've got some work to do. Ho ho ho! Looks like Elf Joe is on to something! Mmm. Mm-hmm. Smile, Santa! I've got an idea. "North Pole in Crisis"! Santa needs more reindeer! - No way! - No way! Too bad we don't have the reindeer farm anymore. Yeah, kids, rumor has it that Great Grandma Leena's farm is where Santa got the first magical reindeer. Are you for real? No way to know for sure, but it's a fun idea. Don't you think? I have an idea! Really? Maybe Tinsel and Timber could remind Santa about Great Grandma's reindeer. And maybe... maybe we can keep one here! I'll take one, Mom! Me, too! Me, too! Well, I don't see why not. Why don't you go tell them? Well, this should be fun. Yeah, my mummi did have quite a vivid imagination! Elf Pets, it looks like Santa needs your help! The training could be rigorous. There are going to be tests. And trials to overcome. If you want this job and Elf Joe has any luck, you've got to be ready! - Woo-hoo! - All right! Yeah! Looks like they're all in! ♪ Fa la-la la-la la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa la-la la-la la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la la-la la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la la-la la-la ♪ ♪ Woo! ♪ ♪ Yeah! ♪ - Woo-hoo! - Yeah! Woo-hoo! We did it! Hugs, cuddles, and snuggles! - That is clearly the answer! - I concur! Well, it's not there yet, but it's close enough. I think we've got something usable. It's up to Santa now. Santa, we'd like to report we have a solution. Well, partly. It sort of generally works. The base formula is there. When it's activated by love, we think a little reindeer could grow full size! Well, all right. This particular recipe has less love than I would like, so it clearly must be activated by a concentrated form of some type. Ho ho ho! That's quite the theory. But how do we get more love to activate the magic? Hmm. Santa! Santa! Yes? Tinsel, what is it? The Peura kids! They... they volunteered! Slow down. Now, what happened? They want to help. They asked us for a pikku deer. Could that work, Santa? - Well, that's a fine idea! - It's foolproof! Everyone knows children have the purest of faith. And the strongest love! Hmm. As for additional reindeer... Ho ho ho ho! My friendly Elf Pets, this task would be big, as big as it gets! Don't count them out! They're tiny, like us, but we have no doubt that kids will adopt them. And give them a name. They'll treat them like us. One in the same! Perhaps with more reindeer and faith, that is true. We can build Christmas magic that will help the sleigh through. Oh, oh! He's going to do it! Do what? Present Christmas magic in a teeny, tiny, little heart charm. Oh, yeah, that's right! - Wow! - I can't believe this! - This is amazing! - The hope of each child who believes in their heart in the magic of Christmas will make my sleigh start! Wear this charm proudly for people to see. It should serve to remind them your mission's for me. ♪ Let them hold you and love you As much as they can ♪ ♪ This heart holds your magic Do you understand? ♪ ♪ This magic's not fragile Not like an elf ♪ ♪ Your job's not the same To watch from the shelf ♪ ♪ Your job is to snuggle And nestle up tight ♪ ♪ To store up the wonder That makes me take flight ♪ ♪ To store up the wonder That makes you take flight ♪ ♪ The night before Christmas Once sleep has come ♪ ♪ The sleigh will approach And you will become ♪ ♪ A fully grown reindeer Brilliant and grand ♪ ♪ While magic goes 'round you Like blowing sand ♪ ♪ Up, up through the air You'll sail, and you'll twirl ♪ ♪ Happy for time spent With each boy and girl ♪ ♪ This magic's not fragile Not like an elf ♪ ♪ Your job's not the same To watch from the shelf ♪ ♪ Your job is to snuggle And nestle up tight ♪ ♪ To store up the wonder That makes me take flight ♪ ♪ To store up the wonder That makes you take flight ♪ Oh, Santa! Thank you! Thank you so much! And I would like to thank all of you, and Timber and Tinsel, for sharing Benjamin and Julia's idea with me. This won't work without kids who believe! That's enough dawdling. Shoo! Shoo! Off you all go! Get those reindeer shipped to homes around the world for adoption. Look! I found her. Tinsel looks so cute. And look at Timber. He's brave to hide in Dad's work boots. Pee-ew! - That's gross! - It's so smelly! It smells like someone tooted in there. Hey, kids! You're up early. Hey, Dad! We found Tinsel and Timber! Ah. Well, aren't they clever? What do you have there? Oh, just a little something I found outside the door. It's addressed to you three kiddos. Who's it from? It says, "Tinsel and Timber." - No way! That's awesome! - Cool! Really? Dad, what is it? Let's open it and find out. It's a reindeer! Let me see! There's one for each of us! They're so tiny. Just like your Grandma Leena's! Yeah! Go figure. You know, it really is unreal. They look just like her drawings. Mom! Macy! Come look! - What is it? - Look what the elves did. Really? Wow! That's awfully thoughtful of them. There's one for you, too, Macy. For me? That's so cool! Looks like Tinsel and Timber outdid themselves. So the book says you have to give them a name. I'm naming mine S'norms! Don't you mean S'mores? I think S'norms is a perfectly good name. I'm going with... Peanut Butter, 'cause it's my favorite sandwich. I'm going with... Holly Bejolly! What? I like it. "If you love it enough, the heart charm that holds Santa's magic will make these tiny, little reindeer grow full-size on Christmas Eve!" "And then your reindeer will help pull Santa's sleigh!" Coolest... reindeer... ever! ♪ We got a reindeer ♪ ♪ We got a reindeer ♪ ♪ Gonna hold it near ♪ ♪ We got a reindeer ♪ Ah, that was so good! - You got cool moves! - That's awesome!

I'm so excited! Me, too! - Whoa! - Whoa! Holy icicles and gumdrops! What was that? The reindeer. Ho ho ho ho ho! It took me a minute to get used to it, but now I think it's rather festive, don't you? Yeah! Can we do it again, Santa? Once a year, my little Scout Elves! Once a year! Well, then, shall we go? You bet! We love you, Peura family. See ya next year! Up, up, and away! On S'norms!
