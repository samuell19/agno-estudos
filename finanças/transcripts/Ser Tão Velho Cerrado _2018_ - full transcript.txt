The cerrado is rich. The cerrado is millionaire. And if you go to those fields, in this cerrado, in these lagoons, in order to see the flowers now, it is very rich! Through the cerrado, we have water, life, sustenance, everything through the cerrado. The cerrado is the oldest of the environmental formations in the modern history of Planet Earth. The Cerrado has fully materialized in its global formation, with all its environments, 45 million years ago. OLD LORD SAVANNA The fauna of the cerrado is specialized. The flora of the cerrado is specialized. You have, in the cerrado, many organisms that have dealt with different climatic characteristics of the past, with climatic changes, and they survived. And these survival solutions are very important, even for our survival. There is an extremely violent pharmacological potential in the cerrado. From the cerrado I take off the herbs to keep a good health. I make medicinal soap from the fruit of the cerrado, medicines, homemade vermifuge, expectorant. I make medicine for psoriasis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, all with herbs. I had an endemic disease in the region called leishmaniasis. I drank tea with the plants of the cerrado and I treated it with herbs and I was cured of leishmaniasis. The cerrado is an environmental matrix that is located in the Central "Chapadões" of Brazil, in which there is the biggest floristic diversity in the world and there is also one of the greatest diversities of animals in the Planet Earth. Its existence is important for the balance of the biomes that surround it. The cerrado is considered a hotspot, which is some very few areas in the world that are considered of extreme importance for having species that only exist here and that are under some degree of endangerment. Canela-de-Ema is a plant of slow growth and that can live for more than a thousand years. Then, in a field where you see a lot of Canela-de-Ema, a tractor never got in there. They were born before the tractor was invented And this very old being received very recently, a few thousands of years ago, the visit, and it was not a visit, of a very new being, who is here to stay. This new being is the man. And the presence of the man... has dramatically changed the structure of the cerrado, its cover, and its life. Everyone says, "Oh, they're destroying the Amazon." Dude, what they're doing with the cerrado is a lot worse and a lot faster. The cerrado has reached its evolutionary climax. This means that, once degraded, it never recovers in the fullness of its biodiversity. What was the original cover of the cerrado, currently 50% do not exist anymore than the delimitations of the biome according to IBGE. It has already reached an almost irreversible extinction process. What remains are small patches of preserved area in the conservation units. The EPA of Pouso Alto is the largest EPA in the state of Goiás. It covers an area of 872,000 hectares, which is one of the last refuges of cerrado in the country. We are what remained of the Brazilian cerrado. What remained of these lands that took millions of years to grow and which were destroyed in the entire state of Goiás, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, in whole Brazil. EPA is a conservation unit of the group of sustainable use which the main goal is to order the occupation of the territory. Activities within this conservation unit should be the basis for conservation. What can and cannot be done in this EPA is determined by a handling plan. So, the key to an EPA is a broad articulation, with various sectors of society living in the EPA, and the development of agreements. The handling plan is a great agreement to coexist in the EPA. The handling plan initially proposed is practically the institutionalization of environmental crimes. So that's why we are fighting for us to have a handling plan that is consistent with the EPA proposal. One of the focal points is the institution of conservation unit. It aims at improving the quality of life of the populations involved. The fight is about to make, in the first place, the council of the Pouso Alto EPA becomes representative, because, nowadays, it is composed of powerful farmers. Occupied by those who don't care, who are not concerned about tourism, neither with the environmental preservation. We don't have representativeness of the tourist area, the rural settlements are not represented, family and organic farming are not represented, the kalunga community is not represented. The historical site and cultural patrimony Kalunga is the quilombo Kalunga, the biggest quilombo of Brazil, which is in the city of Cavalcante, Teresina and Monte Alegre. Cavalcante arose due to the gold. At the time, 10,000 slaves were registered working in the gold mines. From this mixture quilombo was formed, by the runaway slaves, the abandoned, and, later, the freed ones and so on, and it remained very isolated. Kalunga, for us, was a suffering people who came here to get hidden, they survived and here they are. I'm proud to be Kalunga. I was born and grew up here. And the things for us were difficult here. Everything was difficult. We had to take care of things by ourselves, out of the woods. Take care of the stick root, to survive, to take care of our health. And at that time, the people here were all healthy. It was hard to hear that a person died. Nowadays here, what I feel most is that the disease is more present than it has ever been. Who is a honoured Kalunga, truly, continues Kalunga until today, using the tradition. Both in medicinal plants, in the way of living, and in culture. What has changed today in Kalunga is the improvement, the quality of life, I know it has to improve even more, but it has been. Because sometimes people confuse culture with poverty. We must always preserve our culture and not poverty. Every Kalunga is suffered, in the way that one gets better, I want them all to get better too. I want more strengthen for the Kalunga. To improve our culture, our community. But, I don't want anything that can destroy our community. The territory Kalunga is huge. Actually, is the largest quilombola territory in the world. 272,000 hectares. It seems a lot, but it is still small, considering that many descendants of the quilombolas do not have a demarcated land, or are outside the kalunga territory. I was born and raised in the village of São José. I made my living working, sweating, carrying the hoe and the ax, planting. And here I have my hens, my cows. And the land that I sold I got from my grandfather's great-grandfather, and I sold to the mining company. Here is a field of manganese extraction. The biggest manganese deposit of the Goiás State is located here. This is the manganese, that is extracted from the flagstone. It is an iron alloy. Without this ore here, we're not able to travel by airplanes or to drive a car. I would be against the extraction if it could cause damages, if it had impact. But it has a minimal impact. This material can come back to the same hole where that flagstone had been broken. The residue is a fertilizer. You can mix in the land and plant any forestation. Look, that was residue, look how beautiful the trees are now. The local population still has a very limited vision about environmental issues. Take a look at the problem that happened in Mariana. Then, at the moment that a project, that we receive that stack of paper from EIA-RIMA, we, the society, have the obligation to observe all the details. We depend on this to have a better chance of stopping the greed of mining. But to prevent it, I think, particularly, that it is very unlikely. Unfortunately, in Cavalcante, all the history of the city has one strong link with the mining. This is a dry river bed. This place means a lot for Cavalcante, because it was the first declared mining of crystal. These receding waters were all explored with shovel and pickaxe in order to explore and, therefore, silting up, leaving it with this width. There is a mining company inside the town, I think it's not good for anyone. This is an inheritance of centuries of mining, because they have taken tons of gold out from here. They had gone with the gold and the city is still needy. And what was left was this wonderful stream, but polluted with mercury. Paranã River is within the quilombola territory. Gold, diamond, there was everything in this river and it was explored. There were the ferries out there, and nothing was given to the community. A mining company will arrive here, destroy everything, take all the wealth away. Leaving only the damage here. Cavalcante has 300 years of mining exploration and it is an extremely poor city until nowadays. Who’s buying is receiving billions and who's working here is almost being enslaved, and helping to spoil the nature, on the verge of misery or below the line of poverty. So, it's not fair. Currently, I consider mining as the main threat of the Chapada dos Veadeiros, in this portion. My opinion on the mining companies here in our territory. My opinion is no. Because of the bad things that remain for us, because it is still preserved, but if it continues like this... I don't know what's going to happen. The people panned out a bit there, later the police came and took them away. And we thought it was good. The people panned out this way and that way until the water of Rio Paranã got toxic. Cavalcante is a very rich mineral city. The city, as a whole, understands that this activity is important. it cannot be predatory. Everything that is for preservation is welcome since they come with a measure, not of destruction, but of construction, all right. I make my living from the ore. I believe somehow that there could be an area 100% protected, and some areas that are already degraded, and there is ore yet, where people could keep mining in order to do not create conflict. What we need is mining with social and environmental responsibility at all. Despite of the mining potential of the municipality of Cavalcante, the sector that employs and raises income in the city, much more than that, is tourism. Tourism distributes income. Then, really, in terms of interest of the population, in social and environmental terms, the tourism is very attractive for the city. One thing must coexist with the other until, of course, the ecotourism be fortified, and that the families here start to depend on the ecotourism more than on the illegal mining prospection. The Kalungas preserves the nature. They do not sell the land to anyone. Kalunga's land belongs only to the Kalunga people. And the Kalungas had always needed this for their survival. Like hunting, even getting wood to make their own houses, fishing, but not in a way that spoils the environment. We work in the slash-and-burn agriculture. One year we plant, the other we reforest. We plant five to six years nonstop, and then we leave that field and go to another place. In six years, when we leave the field, this bud will have this thickness and we will be able to plant again. You can see how the woods had been regenerated. One up to five years it is going to be a bush just like this other part here. And what we do is passed on from generation to generation. This type of land here is culture land, is an organic product native to the land, no need to put any chemical product. They are Creole seeds, they are centennial seeds, that people use every year and always renewing this type of seed, with which we also feed our family and the neighbours. There is neither poison nor tractor here. Here it goes by itself. Everything is from here, beans, rice, and corn to feed the hens. My father taught me to work like this. This one ripe here, it's mine. That is another owner's. That is another owner's. Those are another owner's. There are thousands of owners here inside this place. We've planted this! It had been 350 years running away for the outback. They were hunted mercilessly, including by the mercenary Lampião. After so much injustice, to question the quilombola territorial rights is racism. Eating wood root, they had resisted and resists until today. It is Africa, the heart of Brazil. In scarcity or in abundance, the Kalungas discovered the super foods. Special foods, highly nutritious. All the food of the cerrado, when you eat it, besides nourishing, it cures you. It has the power of healing, it makes your body work. When I arrived in Alto Paraíso, I started working in some places and began to observe the amount of fruit that was being wasted. I started to search a little about the cerrado, along with the Kalungas, seeing the potential that they took off coconut oil, they took off the flour. I got to develop some candies, some jams. I noticed that Jatobá would be ideal to make coffee, a cappuccino, you can make porridge, ice cream emulsifier, creams, cakes, and bread. Besides having a very good and extremely clean nutrition, you protect the environment when using these resources. Then they have a total sustainable extraction, which will generate income because, so far, they thought like “Wow, but who will want to buy buriti? What can we make with buriti”. This is buriti. You can make juice, risotto, creams, ice cream. This is a buriti cookie, coquinajá flour and inside is a type of Nutella made of guava candy with cacao. We try to rescue that in order to keep this way so that the cerrado survives and the people can see the cerrado in a different way, what can it bring in our benefit, so that our children and our grandsons can know buriti, Baru, souari nut, because this is also culture, you know? Everyone looks at the cerrado like that place of twisted and dry trees, but thanks to this there's so much water springing up here. You look at the cerrado and are convinced that it is in a dry place, it's not. The roots are in the water. The water table is very deep, about 15, 20, 30 meters. The roots reach there. So, the trees do not lose their leaves in the cerrado. The cerrado, the cerrado roots associated with the life compounds contribute to water infiltration. Where does the water come from? Some source? Where is the source? It is the water that flows from the soil. The rock quartzite is a sponge, when it absorbs water, there is much space between the parts of the rock to make it get soaky. You have this “chapadões” relief with very deep ground. Then this ground is like you had increased the size of this water box. The fact of being in a plateau a little higher also makes it works like an umbrella, distributing water for other regions of Brazil. Water. What do we do without water? Without water is not possible. Water is life. Water is everything. Brasilia, the capital of the country, is getting dry. The water is already lacking and soon many congressmen from the North Wing will be taking a bath with a mug. To them, it’s all right, they are there only from Tuesday to Thursday. But and what about the people, what is going to happen to the people? Chaos. Sadness. And this way, will people care about the cerrado? Brasilia has always had water because, all around it, there was a backcountry, source of water. And now, not anymore. Cerrado is like an old man, a being so old, ignored as an old man that everyone considers senile. They don't want to see, they don't want to hear, ‘that's not my problem!’ What it seems is that nobody cares about it. You can't ignore if you don’t have water on your tap. Can you? We are also aware that the increase of the agricultural limits and everything that it brings behind is undermining the source of water. You cut the tree from the cerrado. The water that is sucked by these larger plants, with these large leaves that make a lot of water evaporate all day long, dries that area and makes the soil drier. The hydrological cycle is not just a function of how much rain is falling, but also about what is the system that is getting this precipitation. So, when you take away a system with deep roots, which has a coverage diverse enough for a simpler system and which is also a major consumer of water, you reduce the ability to recharge and the ability of outcropping of this water later in the watercourses. Because this is one of the legends that arose, I do not know which agronomist could have given this information. I do not have any doubt, I am sure enough to say that this hydric balance is favourable for the agriculture areas using the techniques that we use nowadays. The exotic vegetation does not absorb rainwater as the native cerrado vegetation. It only absorbs that amount of water enough for its survival. That is why the recharge of aquifers area no longer exists in the region of the cerrado. The only thing that retains water is the native forest. Then, the more we deforest the cerrado, the less water we have. At least, 10 midsize rivers disappear each year in the cerrado. The Fazenda Gavião area is there, which is one of the biggest land properties here in Goiás. The Fazenda Gavião is a large land property that is very close to the National Park of the Chapada of the Veadeiros. Only in 2016, the governmental body of surveillance, the Chico Mendes Institute, has been in the area for three times and they found unacceptable issues. They had four, four notifications. All this area was an imposing, beautiful cerrado. And we can see some open fields that had the chaining recently. The chaining are two tractors with a giant chain that takes everything that is standing. And they passed this chaining to cultivate the transgenic soybean. And in that farm, there are very evident denunciations that it belongs to the state of Goiás governor's father Fazenda Gavião, right? Yes. Is the father of the governor leasing here to plant? Yes, he is. Is it leased to him? -He is Mr. Ferreira, isn't he? -Marconi Perillo's father. -Is he planting in that area? Of soy? -Yes, he is planting a little bit. -In this region here, he bought about five farms. -Five farms? Everything to deal with soy? Soy, cattle. Why do you think that the roads are being asphalted? Not for no reason. There's a lot of souari nut trees knocked down. They built a "cemetery" of souari nut trees there, giants as well. And the souari nut trees are protected by law. Centennial souari nut trees piled like this, everything piled up. The shattered root, the marks of the chains… It was during the chaining. Two fines are still due for damaging APP, of two streams. And do you think that the people at Fazenda Gavião, for example, will now stop the illegal deforestation business? I do not know whose farm this is... You do not know whose farm is this? I don’t have all details. People say the farm is your father’s, that it’s in your father’s name, Sr. Ferreirinha. I don’t know. My father owns a farm near Colinas town. But I don’t know what its name is, if it’s right or not. Also, I have already asked him to sell this piece of land he owns there, thus we don’t have any kind of involvement about it. There are five mandates of this same PSDB government. They support this rural-supported policy. It’s foolhardy we leave such a great value heritage as Chapada dos Veadeiros up to the decision of an estate driven by agribusiness. They are destroying environment, an ecosystem, forever. What worries me most is something very serious that is the cerrado extinction. A flat area, a deep soil area, an area that has a propensity for agriculture. Do I have the possibility to open new areas? It is morally justifiable that we continue to do this kind of thing knowing that there will be consequences in the future and we don’t change our way to deal with land, to deal with conservation, to deal with the future? What kind of money pays for it? Diversity doesn’t have price. However, nevertheless, it is sold, destroyed forever. I preserve, I am punished. If I preserve, I am punished. If I preserve, everyone wants your farm. They want to expropriate you, they want to plunder you, they want to make part of it excluding you. And who pays for this bill? What about the years of life a person gave up on making a travel, gave up on buying a car, he could have sold it. No, he preserved. Then, I am defending the farmer, because I am a farmer, I must defend my cause, obviously. Preserve is the worst business of the world. No, it’s not! The worst business is transgenic soy. First, because it’s a one-way path. Second, because it’s a loss-making in the long term. The economic soy cycle on cerrado lasts only 6 years. If you do everything right, with culture rotation and so on, you increase it to 12. However, nevertheless, it’s not too much. As productivity is reduced, the farmer increases his debts. The contracts with multinationals of agribusiness are long-lasting and, eventually, producer doesn’t achieve the goal of the contract. On this contract, land is a valid warranty. They say that Marsal lost part of his lands. In fact, I haven’t lost any land. Because I know how to use the courts. “The Way of Cerrado” is the name of the project. This name came up due to devastation that is happening on the way from Brasília to Alto Paraíso on the highway GO 118. And its purpose is to make this denunciation about the impact of agribusiness on cerrado. Naked body is our own purity, our fragility on that vastness of devastation plantation that is happening. “Cerrado - the savannah with greatest diversity of the planet”. Whole horizon is soy, all of it. Notice the incoherence. It’s a project that is showing the way the cerrado is taking. There must be an economic return for those who preserve and provide services to Humanity. Who is going to preserve for free? Does anyone work for free? Does any company work for free? Why rural producer must preserve for free? Is it possible to generate production and do it with ecology? Yes, it is, but there is a cost. The producer is the one who’s going to pay for this cost? A region in which there’s too little appropriate area to agriculture and livestock certainly will grow over pasture areas and often a person will give up of the cerrado areas, mainly if one day we have a payment for efficient environment service and it’s paid to make this person think twice before converting new areas. Payment, isn’t it? But this guy, Leonardo Ribeiro, didn’t think twice before opening a new area, even if there were 600 hectares of soy, even if he had profited 11 million Reais in one year, according to himself. And he has deforested a lot and for real on Rio dos Couros, adjacent area of Brazilian Park. Money for environmental services helps, that’s true. But the problem is another one, it’s spiritual. It’s greed. Brazilian Forestry Code allows devastation of 80% of a particular area on cerrado. 80%, this much. And 85% of cerrado is located in private areas, in other words, farmers’ areas. Thus, cerrado is unprotected. The great culture that is presently extended on cerrado is soy. It occupies 90% of all agriculture expansion in the last 15 years. On cerrado, the risk of deforestation on next decades is about 40 million of hectares, respecting Forestry Code. Cerrado was cut. First thing: there’s already a climate effect, humidity. Second effect: to allow erosion. We are talking about cerrado soils extremely poor. Today they are providing productivity from most fertile soils of the world. How was this done? Through investment in limestone, through investment in phosphorous, through investment in soil correction. Another mistake... excess of limestone mobilizes even the soil structure. Soil becomes more friable, more erodible. It loses nutrients. You use what is technically recommended. There is a technical relation. You use what is necessary to have a minimum production. This varies depending on kinds of soil. Into one of them, you need to use more, into another, you need less. Because nobody would do an agriculture with excess of inputs. There could be a better nutrient manipulation than what you have. Because what you put in excess in agriculture, that’s what I am saying, it leaks. regarding phosphorous and nitrogen, or you contaminate the atmosphere with greenhouse gases (After an interference on native soil, it will never regenerate again.) or you make an eutrophication on your hydric resources. (Algae increase. They consume oxygen.) You carry out the plough, throw limestone to fix acidity or throw manure to increase fertility, then you change soil conditions. Those plants that used to exist there won’t be able to exist anymore, they will vanish. That is why we say cerrado is threatened with extinction. And even if you can produce those species in nurseries, where are you going to plant them? There is no place for you to do what is called revitalization because area that is going to receive this plant has already been modified. The more manure and limestone is used, more insecticide has to be used because you have destroyed biodiversity and plagues have invaded the place. At the end, our plantations become refugee for plagues of agribusiness because they use all kind of pesticides, all kinds of defensive, and we don’t. If you have a monoculture on these altitude fields, on higher areas, then you damage the headwaters over these areas and harm everyone who is below it. And what we’ve been following is the contamination of the rivers due to these poisons that infiltrate the soil, go to the water table and reach water. You pollute a table, an aquifer, it would take thousands, sometimes millions of years to recover this water and make it potable again. We are the largest consumer of poison of the planet. This is serious. In 2013, 265 million gallons of pesticides were used in Brazil A quote per capita of 1.33 gallons per inhabitant. And there are 14 kinds of extremely harmful poisons that continue being used in Brazil. Poisons banned in other parts of the world. We became a drainage market for poisons rejected by the rest of the world. It’s a lot of poison. Our insects are suffering in a very aggressive way in recent times because of the pesticides. You don’t have this pollinator agent anymore. Without pollination, plant can’t produce fruits, and without fruits, it doesn’t have a child to reproduce. This simply takes to the extinction of the species. Whatever is the productive system that is based on pesticides, based on death, it’s not good for cerrado. It’s not good for life. If it is an environmental protection area, how are we going to poison an environmental protection area? So, this is not the development model we want. We want a development based on conservation. Manipulation plan may restrict application of pesticides by crop-dusting. Manipulation plan may bring a prohibition of use of transgenics on the region. Then, without this protection and without the awareness of importance of these areas from source of waters, we really will be witness, still in our generation, of the extinction of cerrado. And this compromises Brazilian waters because cerrado, as a whole, is responsible for 75% of flow of main basins of the country. One basin, in particular, has 97% of its waters coming from cerrado: the São Francisco River Basin. From Minas Gerais to Northeast region, the “River of Brazilian integration” is drying, dying. But who cares? I care. If this Sertão Velho Cerrado, water source, remains unprotected, it may become the tomb of waters. And if you still have doubts about the fact that Brazil needs a law to protect cerrado, think about “Velho Chico”, São Francisco River, that supply 14 million people and is the hope of some water for north-eastern people. You think that we are exaggerating? Let’s see Sobradinho. It is operating with 3% of its capacity. But how it’s going to be when this water ends up? “Climate Wars”, have you ever heard about it? Some say that northeast sertão used to be exuberant, with forests and plentiful rivers. But why then today it is this way? It was degradation of cerrado, caatinga and Atlantic Forest to plant cane. Cane ended up, soil ended up, water ended up. People without memory doesn’t have history, without information and they can’t defend themselves, they can’t raise their head and change things. Water is life. Water is everything. It is inside our body and, still, is seen as a simple commoditiy. We have here the main basin of the region, which is the basin of Tocantizinho River, for which it was already asked a study integrated of hydrographic basin of this river for the implementation of 22 PCHs along the stretch of the river Tocantinzinho. Specifically, in the case of Cavalcante, it was analysed a single river, the Rio das Almas. The dam is Santa Mônica. It would block the river that, later, will supply part of quilombo territory. This is Paranã. It’s here that people from Furnas wanted to do it, but kalunga community didn’t accept. They were going to block this big wall as the other one. The impact of these enterprises on these regions is based on three pillars. Environmental, which is obvious. It changes a river that is rapids for a still state. This makes us lose our main threatened species, that is Brazilian merganser. Brazilian merganser is the most threatened species of the Americas. Today, we have 175 to 225 of these animals in the entire world. It is a species that uses clear and oxygenated water environments, it has an accurate visual sense to feed of fishes and, certainly, the construction of PCHs totally changes the configuration of environment where it lives. One of the great lies told is that hydroelectric is a clean energetic model. It’s not. Reservoirs become genuine greenhouse gas factories, including methane, that is produced with the decomposition of vegetation of these environments without oxygen. It’s not renewable. Because after hydroelectric is over, what do you do? Rebuild the river? It’s an irreversible intervention. There's the social factor, where the presence of various men, workers, impacts our social system, our health system and our education system. Associated to this problem of quality of life, lack of service, a hospital that doesn’t work, that doesn’t have potable water. Security problems, violence. “Violence that came together with factory” “Belo Monte – 100 thousand inhabitants – apprehension of weapons increased 379%”. We don’t want this. If a hydroelectric is built here for us, we will feel like losing someone of our family, a child. They already came here to ask us to sign papers to be indemnified. They went to my neighbour’s, then they went to Brivaldinho’s, moreover, Brivaldinho was indemnified too. The first thing they do with local population is to try to give the impression that it is an accomplished fact. A project that still is in study phase, that normally not even has a process of environmental license, they do it as a way to manipulate the population into not mobilizing themselves to defend their rights, to divide the population. Someone came here saying that it was a government work. I didn’t want to sign any document, but they insisted that anyway we would be indemnified and the work would be done. Also, it is about economic aspect, considering our economy depends on ecotourism that depends on a region with preserved waterfalls, with clear water. Today, the river for me is the meaning of my life. Because I really depend on people coming to visit the river, coming to swim on it, to dive on it. Because the fish would disappear and the river would also end, here is also where I make my trips. I don't want to be alive to see it, because I think it's going to hurt a lot, it will kill me inside, it's going rip the life out of me. Today, the way the management plan was presented to us, the construction of small hydros is authorized, in the Pouso Alto EPA, in the Environmental Protection Area. 99% of this energy will go to other applications, which are mining in the local for industrial parks, for large cities. We're not radically against the construction of small hydroelectric plants. We need to study it on a case by case basis. It is the pressure of those who will gain economically with this action. Arrangements made with contractors, which I don't know if are really legal, end up leading to the application of this model. The construction of small hydroelectric plants in the Tocantinzinho River was authorized. Rialma, the company owned by the Caiado family, is about to start the construction of the power plants Colinas, Serrana Bela, Concórdia, Bom Sucesso, Harmonia, and Renascença. All in the Tocantinzinho River. You can hear the sound of bulldozers destroying the cerrado. And the left bank of the river was completely devastated. I'll ask them, with love and care, for the love of God, that they never make that dam here. Let us preserve our lives. That's what we're asking them, the Government, the president, congressmen, that’s what I really ask, for the love of God, take pity on those who suffer. Don’t abuse those who have already suffered. The country’s energy matrix is based on hydropower. It was built from the 1970s. We have hydropower projects here, in Serra da Mesa. Brazil’s largest water body, 54 billion cubic meters. Serra da Mesa in 90 years won't be able to produce electricity anymore, because sedimentation silts up the lake, and that hinders the production of electrical energy. Although small, it will have an impact on the whole plankton community, which are microorganisms that constitute the basic food of many other fish. So, there's no way that can be compatible. No way, that won’t do. Today, we have two situations that are different from the 1970s. One of them is water shortage, which is already a reality across the country, and the advent of solar energy as an alternative technology to hydropower. Building a small hydro, because of the volume of energy that it will generate, it’s cheaper, it's more profitable, so the benefit-cost ratio is better, more interesting. The region of the Chapada dos Veadeiros park is included as the second best location in terms of potential for solar irradiance in the country. We have a dry season that is six months of the year of full sun, from 6 am to 6 pm. So, we can reject this enterprise providing a solution for the energy matrix that is solar energy. Last year, that other farm over there had several bulldozers felling all the trees. And they left a few and it was all turned into pasture and we're being surrounded by soybeans here, by monoculture, which kills all the waters, all plants and all animals. And then we are, like, willing to do something, singing, playing, developing projects to raise awareness, of environmental education. People need to be informed, because by informing them, they get to know and, knowing, they may be motivated to act. It's a very special moment, creating this new region called MATOPIBA. It includes Maranhão, Piauí, Tocantins, and Bahia. MATOPIBA is seen as a large area of agricultural frontier. One of the great areas in which food production in the world tends to expand. In fact, a dozen large farmers were the ones interested in MATOPIBA, precisely for the possibility of expanding their heritage. Expansion occurred, especially, in areas of cerrado. Directly converting cerrado into grain production, soybeans essentially. So, today, the area that is undergoing deforestation is MATOPIBA and that is concerning. We are transforming and increasing grain production without deforestation. Without deforestation. Without deforestation. It's not just the converted area. It’s the degraded areas that were left. It’s the marginalized populations. I'm very sad. I feel very sad about this injustice. For being forced out with brutality because of some farmer who says they own the world. Today we plant 80,000 hectares. There are 10,000 hectares of maize crops, 65,000 hectares of soybeans, 3,000 hectares of normal crop corn, and 12,000 hectares of cotton. In the future we’re going to Pará, right? Wherever we have to expand to, we will, further north, right? If we ever get to the sea, then we stop, right? So nowadays we are seeing a process of land concentration, which was not common, someone having 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 hectares of land. Today, this is becoming something common, isn’t it? In MATOPIBA, a few have a lot. 0.5% of the population has 60% of the wealth, and 80% of the population is considered to be very poor. These families have a monthly income of less than R$ 700. What is MATOPIBA? You take the last reserves, remnants of cerrado, and turn all this into production of commodities. You will reap fruits for 5 years, 10 years, and leave a desert to future generations, and to the whole country you will leave a great economic and social crisis of which we don't know the consequences. A crisis of hunger and thirst, because in the production system of Brazil’s agribusiness, a single seed patented by a foreign company only works with pesticide also from that company. This creates a dependence link between the farmer and multinational companies. We create super-bugs and to fight them, super-pesticides. With time and the spread of this system, traditional and biologically diverse seeds are lost. And, thus, we lose any chance of getting out of this system. Diversity means survival, means being able to continue producing. Therefore, speaking about famine is no exaggeration. The velho cerrado outback is not at risk. The human being is the one at risk. The current agricultural and agrarian policy forgot that the human being is included in the ecological chain. This argument that agribusiness is the saviour of Brazil, increases GDP, is a lie. It is the saviour of the economy today. But, in the long term, it is the bankruptcy of farmers and of a productive system of thousands of years, its culture, cultivation and seeds. When the Brazilian soy is exported to China, China is not buying the pollution that we threw in our waterways. We are not exporting grain. We are exporting water, biodiversity, and we are exporting soil. What sense does it make that we destroy the Brazilian cerrado to feed cows in China? And with this fallacy, with this untruth, that it is meant to end hunger in the world? Development, yeah! We want production, we need to eat. But we want a production without pesticides, we want an organic production, we want agroecology. We want something that is in accordance with environmental preservation. We may have food, but we have to think about the water, we have to think about the neighbour who is planting their organic produce. That's what we’ve been discussing in the planning for the management of the Pouso Alto EPA, that we should have compatible activities. Most family farmers are within the EPA, where they will have to preserve and need to produce and survive, but agribusiness presses in all manners. And that’s why some people are quitting the work of family agriculture, they are going to other farms to work as employees or going to urban areas. Their children don't see prospects to continue because there is a very strong pressure for them to leave. How can it be that half a dozen large farmers survive and there are 5,000 farmers in the region, 5,000 farmers. Are you going to stay there eternally dependent, dependent, just on salary, on staying employed and leaving your area and not being able to work in your land area? The advancement of agriculture is a necessary advancement. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is necessary. Agriculture is vital to us. In fact, right here, in the surroundings of Alto Paraíso, there are several settlements with family farming, which supply the city. These monocultures do not supply Alto Paraíso in any region here, they are all for export. The fellow does not believe in what he does because if he believed in what he did, he'd eat transgenic soy, with pesticides, and give it to his children. Ask him if he gives it to his children. Family producers produce much more food, with much higher quality. What is on the table of Brazilian people, those vegetables, legumes, those small products, come from family farmers. Agroecology, the basic principle is the man in the field, the social welfare of that family that is there, but it is also social welfare here, to eat without poison. It’s very good, isn’t it? Because we can eat well, we can pass it to others, right? Knowing that you are integrated with society in a fair manner, you know? You’re doing good and receiving good, you’re earning your daily bread by promoting the health of others. Residents here foster this farmer's market so that things work the way we believe the world has to be: better. The great thing about it is the direct marketing aspect, that is, those you will find at the fair selling are producers, there’s no middleman there in front of you selling, those are the ones who produce, you ask them and they say: I used this, I used that, and that. I work with my own seeds, my own seeds. I don't work with soybeans, corn, no transgenic, I also don’t buy them. Food should be produced without poison. Food isn’t compatible with poison, they are totally different things. They started with this poison in the 1960s, before that we produced very well without poison. Carrot, radish, arugula, milkweed, which is native. We get everything from the little vegetable garden, take a look. We have arugula, mustard, lettuce, cilantro, garlic, there's a boldo plant, this one is cassava plant, this one is pomegranate, we even plant beans. Some lettuce, you know? There are papayas, tomatoes, I'm doing well for ecology, huh? A coconut tree, the macaúba palm which has fruit, down there is the buriti. Around 30 days from now this will all be full, you know? Here there are small plants of spice. This is a vine of dragon fruit that I am cultivating, they're growing up. Pepper, below that I have pepper to take advantage of the space, you know? All without insecticide, all pure, pure. All agriculture has an impact, but it may have, also, a positive impact. Is it possible to have large-scale production in an organic manner? Yes, and with great biodiversity too. The organic system is much more efficient economically in many cultures, beans, soya. We have managed to reach a near conventional productivity and we have equivalent production efficiency. The non-organic, if you don't have a transition, then we have the part with integrated production where we incorporate conventional technical systems with organic systems, having a middle ground. Living from the forest and producing food in the forest, with forest, I can show that it works. The human being could be reconciled with the planet. For we have disconnected from the life of the planet, thinking that we are intelligent and not seeing that we are part of an intelligent system. We work to create areas of permanent inclusion, and not areas of permanent protection of the human being. What you see with the growth of agroforestry is the rebirth of nature, the restructuring of the soil so it acquires a life of its own and gains in useful life, producing food for countless generations. The family farmer, the small farmer, he doesn't want to extinguish the water, he doesn't want to destroy the woods. He wants to preserve them because he intends to continue there. And when we study agroforestry, permaculture, when you learn with agroecology, with organic agriculture, with family agriculture, you see, I even shiver when I speak about it. Because when you learn these things you truly feel part of nature, man. And if we are organic agroecological farmers, we produce a little bit of everything. For example, today I make brown sugar here during the drought. When the rain season starts, I have a lot of mangoes, a lot of guava, then I should make guava sweets or guava pulp, or from other fruits, right? That’s a more traditional or more typical or more regional use of different food sources, this is an insurance we have for adverse situations. It’s the result of a long history of coexistence with the environment. I'm part of a cooperative, the Agroecological Cooperative, in the region of Chapada dos Veadeiros park. And in that cooperative practically 100% of farmers are family farmers. It has more than 200 members. We serve the Federal Government programs for purchase of food. 30% of school meals in the region already receive raw materials from our organic producers. These are small productions, you know? Schools have a very great need for this food. It’s natural food, you know? We prioritize organic food. And who eats at school? Their children. So, they produce their own food and the Government pays for it. The State needs to bring investments to promote economic activities compatible with the sustainable development of the region. That may bring economic wealth generation combined with the conservation and preservation of the environment. This development for soybean planting, it comes, usually, only for landowners. The workforce used is very little, only a few employees are needed. Soybean production is not a culture that generates much employment, you know? On the contrary, in fact the expansion of soy leads people to go away from the countryside. What we believe brings development are jobs that not only bring dividends, but that preserve the nature of this region. That include the family, that make children who grow up here love this place. There really is another model of development for this country based on conservation, based on biodiversity, based on water, based on the social and cultural richness of traditional communities. Here we have a small sample of cerrado, Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, which is where we are now. When that park was created, during the government of Juscelino Kubitschek, it had approximately 700,000 hectares. It received a series of mutilations during the Military Government. Today it has around 10% of its original area. There are 65,000 hectares. Today we plant 80,000 hectares. And that's very little, especially for the fauna. What we have today in the Chapada dos Veadeiros park is not effective to conserve the biodiversity of the region. Brazil no longer needs a park. Brazil, today, is a large preserved park. Of the entire cerrado, we have 0.5% of protected areas of more restricted categories such as national park. An EPA, that category of Environmental Protection Area, we can't have the same degree of conservation as a national park like that. And about three years ago, the Ministry of the Environment, in partnership with the ICMBIO, resumed the studies for a new expansion of the National Park. So those areas that we most fight for conservation, which are the fields of altitude, they would be integrated into a more protective category, which is a national park. We already have a formal document from the state government in which the governor authorizes the creation of the park and we will sign it. We're going to be surprised now with someone saying: you see, now your property is no longer yours, Brazil requested it and you will be paid God knows when. The National Park was created 60 years ago and to date there are people who have not been indemnified. First, they have to analyse the situation of the current park and see how they are going to proceed with the new park. A park like this that is having problems on its creation, because of the few owners, it should be said that there are not many, on the expansion of the park, there are few properties, we'll try, yeah, to come up with the best possible solution. So far, we have strived to preserve it and take care of our farm. Now our objective is going to be our lawsuit and receiving the money it is worth. They are entitled to it. The land is theirs. I don’t want the land to not be paid. I think they deserve the fair price. The National Park has 65% of its area in Cavalcante. And today there is no gate in Cavalcante, which is called the North Gate. We're working on it. And, with the opening of that gate, we hope that the park come to be effectively an instrument for regional integration. For the tourism sector that's going to have major potential for generating employment, opportunities, because it will create new services. It is fundamental to receive the citizens of Brazil and of the world here in the National Park and in the Chapada. It is essential that people experience this complexity. I think the Chapada dos Veadeiros park is a place that is, like, pretty amazing, with the nature we have here. No one would be here today if this were all soy plantation. I have no doubt about it. We are walking with the boys by the waterfall, getting in touch with nature. As for tourism, it is quality of life, isn’t it? This is very important in preserving the environment. The cerrado is the heart of Brazil, it connects all biomes, it distributes water to all biomes. How come such an important biome that supplies nearly the whole country doesn't have a law? Hence was born the Mais Cerrado Foundation. The first step is we manage to lobby for the law of the cerrado, this is a necessity. Our work is mostly connecting agents, experts. Making this interconnection to strengthen the network so the cerrado, really, is included in the agenda. I'm totally adhering to this cause, I want to fight. I was called cordially and I call you all to join us. Let's make this place here an example for the world, not only for Brazil. And not only Alto Paraíso, but also the Pouso Alto EPA which comprises six municipalities in the region. When we got into this situation of the Pouso Alto EPA, we saw two inconsistencies: the first was the management plan itself, which was being presented in an unsustainable manner; the second, something that we from the Foundation first filed a suit in the public prosecutor's Office, was the lack of representativeness within the Council. Civil society had a very strong mobilization, very important, which required readjustment in the studies of the management plan for a proposal that is more consistent with the interests of preservation in the region. Cerrado standing is what we want. Public Hearing to Discuss the Management Plan for the Pouso Alto EPA – May 14, 2015 Alto Paraíso de Goiás – May 31, 2016 We are uniting the federal, state, and municipal governments, the third sector, the private sector, civil society, in favour of this common goal, which is to open paths to sustainable living, a life in harmony with nature. With the presence of governor Marconi Perillo, with the support of the vice governor and of the entire government, the Pouso Alto EPA management plan ordinance is signed. Nowadays, we are combining our efforts. We are setting cooperation agreements to really put in practice the manipulation plan, which was so dreamed and wished by everyone. In respect to discussion and the manner to find ways in sustainability, this manipulation plan is a benchmark. There were victories, undoubtful. All APA headwaters will have an increase of their APPs from 30 to 100 m. Main rivers of the region will also have their APPs increased. This protected forest strip is important to water resources to biodiversity. There is also space for soy monoculture, but not everywhere. And there are intangible areas, where it is not possible any human intervention. It’s necessary that everyone is aware about the importance of environment preservation. This cannot be an ecologist thing, this has to be everyone’s. Another advance, the creation of Work Groups. It is the only manipulation plan that you complete, and work groups keep discussing to when revision time comes. It is a work group that is discussing agriculture toxin, also discussing the transition of farming into plantation, that is discussing mining and energy. We already had agreed that there would not be PCHs. Then, I want to know if you could ensure that will be no PCHs? Because it seems that the text that was homologated it is not what had been discussed. The text we approved together is there. Despite of all discussion and concordance about hydroelectric plants theme, paragraph 4 that prevented they could take place was not published. All advisers, unanimously, approved the text that was published in manipulation plan as it is. In relation to a PCH specifically, there was two items I recognize that were conflicting. Work Group will show what is going to be done in the future. Work Group is not exempt. This is Bernardo Caiado. His family owns RIALMA, a company that intends to build dams at Chapada dos Veadeiros, the same people who bought Brivaldinho and Marina’s land. Caiado has nominated himself as coordinator of Work Group and got approval of a resolution that, not only authorizes dam building at APA, but also encourages them. At the end of a vitiated and party council, Bernardo Caiado achieved to proceed with his family plans. Most probably, the dams at Tocantizinho River will be built. Also, at Paranã River and Almas River. For example, what about the matter of Bernardo Caiado? He is not resident because he is an adviser, is that possible? I prefer not make comments about it because it is a very delicate matter that is already being handled. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the signature of decree with new council formation, as foreseen. Council is a discussion stage of issue openness to make us achieve preferably a consensus, a negotiation, so that we can solve problems of Pouso Alto APA. Current council is totally compromised with industrial agriculture interests. (Council Meeting of Pouso Alto APA– 19/08/2016) Everybody knows the real reason of changing this council: environmental sectors arguing they are minority. Fundação Cultural Palmares and quilombo community, what some of these actors who are there have to be with APA? Quilombo Community is not here inside. By legal force, settlers and quilombos need to enter. Sir, could you respect my speech? Go on. Suddenly, a rule is changed without previously consulting us. Then, we are acting the fool. It has been two years that sectors that consider themselves harmed are asking... To change the council? Let’s vote, let’s define We won’t vote because this council is asymmetric. Voting here doesn’t count. It’s what we want to fix. It’s exactly what we want to fix, this asymmetry. And what you say it has to be, it has to be because there are fifteen people in your favour. That’s what we want to change. We want diversity. It has been two years that sectors claim for their chairs. APA’s current council has 29 chairs of which two are not occupied and only five have some commitment with environment. Every representativity must have a voice within the council. This is democratic. It’s about you catching attention of everyone who lives in Chapada. APA’s council changing proposal creates representativity to important sectors that integrate the territory, as tourism, settlers of land reform, quilombos and researchers. Who’s going to speak on behalf of kalunga but he himself? Who’s going to speak on behalf familiar farmers but they themselves? We must maintain parity, equal representation: only public authorities and civil society. There’s no other way of parity to be matched, for example, productive sector with environmental sector. BRAZILIAN SYSTEM OF CONSERVATION UNITS offers a clear demonstration of what main segments are desirable to form the council. There is no guarantee of formation changing. Is that optional? It’s not optional. It is the law, it’s mandatory. Compliance with applicable law is essential. Plural participation of society is mandatory. I will define an immediate action of ICMBIO on this actual case. I’m not satisfied with this environment limitation. It stifles a lot the development of certain areas, certain sectors, as agribusiness sector, mining sector, energy production. What does agribusiness, allied to politics, think about cerrado? They think that is a farming expansion reservation, that it can’t have restrictions. Which are the Govern counterparties? So far, we’ve only heard what we are going to do to improve our environment which is the best of Brazil. It’s all about environment, environment, environment, it’s environment, it’s environment, environment, as if it was a total devastation, but it’s not what happens. When I consider farming areas and pasture areas, I have here approximately 90.000.000 hectares of biome cerrado converted. This converted area has impacts that compromise carbon stocks. Cerrado has oligotrophic soil. But what is that? Oligotrophic soil is the soil that needs basic nutrients. And this is important because cerrado plants take their food of air. And what is these plants’ food? CO2, which cleans atmosphere and prevents, continuously, advance of greenhouse effect. The way of occurrence of radiation balance, energy balance, and the changes between surface and atmosphere were deeply changed. We are not polluters anymore. We are just sequestering carbon. We are helping. This speech is distorted. Global warming is not due to rural producer. Climate depends on superficial processes. If I am changing the surface, I am changing the climate. A false dilemma was set out in Brazil about farming production and conservation being enemies, antagonistic. This is not true if you look the situation of livestock, which is the activity that has occupied more territory, it lives together with extremely reduced number of productivity. Thus, Brazil has great conditions to improve its performance in livestock and make more room to expand other cultures. All these in a conservation environment. Sustainability, maybe, could be translated as viability, as something that is, in fact, possible at the current situation. It’s another template that the world demands nowadays, simply because it’s the viability of a future. Tomorrow only exists if it exists to everyone. There’s no tomorrow for one, there is tomorrow for everyone. We are all in the same boat, is that what all climatic conventions around the world talk about all the time. Sustainability is about this: it’s taking care of our home, our land, our water, our air. The way is not fighting agribusiness. The way is strengthening other means to value culture, value the cerrado, value people who live here, agroecology, organic farming, tourism is essential. In this world everything is interconnected. There is an interdependency between absolutely everything that is alive. Water is alive, so, in a just way, the spirit of water is a manifestation of Great Universal Mother and that we really are disrespecting because we don’t see it, because we don’t feel it. Thus, we don’t realize life that is in the trees, in the rivers, in the stones. We don’t realize that they have life. We are destroying ourselves without knowing we are doing it due to such our disconnection with greater reality of life of what we really are, of what is this game here in this world. In all three worlds, terrestrial, astral and celestial, I may meditate under splendour from that sun that enlightens us. That all golden light may cherish our understanding and guide us toward to sacred abode. The country with greater potential to exploration of nature tourism in the world is Brazil. Wouldn’t be more appropriate that my first source of income was the forest since I have 60% of territory covered by forests? Instead of destroying the forest to cultivate agriculture. Economy of the region is growing faster than Brazilian GDP with ecotourism and this ecotourism depends on preservation. That region immediately becomes a world importance within the context of protected areas, within the context of areas for ecotourism. And this increases the sensation of community well-being. They feel appreciated, their self-stem increases because they feel like belonging to such special place. (MEETING OF WATERS) This is the meeting of São Miguel with Tocantinzinho. This is wonderful. This is paradise. People love it. People like this place a lot. Tourists come, there are people who come here and don’t want to leave. Then people go there, have a tour and come back and end up with food. Later they come back and bring family, bring other people, bring friends. Tourism for us here is a positive point because it has helped and is helping a lot of families to generate income, also helps to preserve environment. And when tourists come is a joy for us. My wife cooks for them, they pay for her, I make my trip, they pay for me. Tourism doesn’t take anything, they always bring something, isn’t? When you can associate visitation to a preserved natural environment, you visit a quilombo community, you enjoy a food prepared by them, planted by them. Tourism has the power of transformation to this local community. And these people now have the opportunity to have their own business, to open their own snack bar, their own camping, their own guesthouse, to be a touristic guide. Then you have a wider range in income distribution due to tourism and especially when you talk about ecotourist. The tourist who is used to visit protected areas has a different profile because they value what it’s important at the local, they want to learn about local, geological, ecological, and social history, they think it is important to try local products, they think it is important to know local cultural manifestations, local handicraft, and all this creates a greater chance of income distribution. This is a socio-environmental benefit because they are people who, sometimes, had to depend on taking of something from nature to their survival, and today they conduct ecotourism visitors and they also work as monitors of socio-environmental impacts of visitation. In other words, ecotourism must be prioritized as a compatible activity to the region. The history of the relationship of mankind with cerrado, of being so young with being so old, has not been a nice history. But we hope we can take care of cerrado and understand that cerrado is complex and it is full of life and this life deserves to be taken care of and deserves to continue here and has space and condition of living together. Contrary to the law, Marconi Perillo, Governor of Goiás, hadn’t decreed APA council changing of Pouso Alto. And worst, ignoring all studies presented, he proposed a new limit to enlargement of Brazilian Park of Chapada dos Veadeiros, transforming conservation area in a Swiss cheese. They even disclosed fake news declaring that the park would be enlarged in 90.000 hectares. The proposal does not benefit population nor environment. Mais Cerrado Foundation and other institutions made a lot of pression and Chico Mendes Institute hasn’t accepted the proposal from government of Goiás. And this signature by the President is taking too long because Government of the State of Goiás decided to interfere on this process. But Sarney, the Government of the State of Goiás presented a proposal that came from Vilmar Rocha which, according to him, arose from a demand of some farmers of FAEG and of Leonardo Ribeiro, who is a specific farmer who we know. So, it means that Leonardo is in charge, is it him who gives the orders to enlarge the park? No. In fact, who gives the orders, ultimately, is the President of Republic. Bombastic news shook Brazil... 3 million Reais in bribe... Michel Temer was recorded consenting kickback... Money deliveries were recorded... Asking for impeachment of Temer... I won’t renounce. Temer was a target to tens of demonstrators who asked respect to democracy, to human rights, to indigenous people and against relaxation on combat to deforestation of Brazilian Amazon. Tomorrow it will be resumed the judgement of action which asks for cassation of Political Candidate Board Dilma-Temer. Ministers of TSE will decide if there was abuse of politic and economic power by the Board. How long are we going to wait? For the enlargement of Brazilian Park of Chapada dos Veadeiros. Now, we are going to sign a decree that enlarges in almost 4 times the area of Brazilian Park of Chapada dos Veadeiros. Thanks a lot and cheers to Chapada. Cheer to cerrado. Miracle. The enlargement of park occurred as we wanted, based on studies instead of businessmen’s wishes. But this park that is on paper has to be implemented and we are going to monitor because sertão velho cerrado is smaller each day, weaker and drier. Unfortunately, some people were very dissatisfied with this enlargement of the park and they are setting fire on cerrado and causing even more destruction at Chapada dos Veadeiros. These fires that devastate Brazilian Park of Chapada dos Veadeiros in Goiás are criminal... The first fire outbreak occurred on October 10th... Fire on the forest as retaliation to the enlargement of the park... People who set fire on it are criminal... Cerrado totally on fire... Criminal fire... The flames destroyed 68.000 hectares, about 28% of the reservation... I am one of the volunteering firefighters here in Chapada dos Veadeiros who is fighting against fire in all directions for more than 10 days. The issue of being criminal is something delicate to talk on this stage. But there are evidences indicating that this fire was induced. It was caused in a period of the day in which weather was hot, in favour of the wind, with very strong winds. Thus, there is a tendency indicating that fire was induced to cause fire in major scale. That’s what we are evaluating. This operation is the greatest operation of firefighting that Brazil has ever had in its history. We are almost 200 people in the field, some in logistic, others preparing food, others acting like firefighters even extinguishing the fires. Thus, this situation brought a huge union for this group, which gets stronger.
