The Gentleman from Cocody Butterflies road blazed. Waiting for instructions. Professor Dumont. All right, go. Number four calling, number four calling. Pay attention: five, six, seven, five, six, seven, a grey Land Rover, licence plate 4274 CI... ...4274 CI driving toward Cocody. Over and out. A cascade of crimes. Here, there, there, there, well, almost everywhere in the whole of our territory, and all of them signed by the same hand. Yes, a panther?s claws. Yes, but this time, boys, there?s something new. Up to now, the panther only attacked, adventurers operating around our diamonds mines, but it just killed Professor Dumont, a gentle scientist, a defenceless butterfly hunter. Why did they kill him? I wouldn?t know, but I think that, rather than seeking our men in tenements and shady neighbourhoods, we should look into luxury residential areas. Maybe that?s where our killers are hiding. Under the mask of respectable people. In Cocody for example. So discreet and bourgeois a district. So quiet. Stop firing, my dear. If you don?t, our affair is going to become really rowdy. You rascal! ...Let my rival croak. ...And I?ll burn for you a candle the size of a coconut palm tree. Oh, come on, come on, come on, you have no rival, my little baby. - Do you swear? - My word as a gentleman. Only my professional duties can tear me from your tenderness. They?re waiting for me at the Embassy. - If you lie to me, I?ll kill myself. - Fine, you do that. - But I?ll kill you first. - Oh? - Si. I aimed for your hat because I wasn?t sure that you?re cheating on me, ...and I?ll shoot you here. I never missed my man. That?s why you?re so charming, my dear. You?re a woman that a man can love to his grave. Bye bye. But he?s going away. Herv?, Herv?! - Yeah. - Mr Delegate, - do you know who?s here? - No. - The attach?. - The attach?? You don?t say? Send him in. Send him in.. By God. Attach?? More like unattached. - Come in. - Mr Delegate? Please take a seat. I?ll be with you in a minute. You may go, miss Zouzou. Rouffignac: acting Embassy delegate. Jean-Luc Herv? de la Tommeraye, Embassy attach?. As you probably know, Sir, I was ordered to stand in for our Ambassador who, being overworked, was forced to go for a rest cure in Vichy. And, since I arrived three days ago, I never had the pleasure of even glimpsing you. - Do you think that?s normal? - Oh no, Mr Delegate. - My sentiment exactly. - I was forced to stay in bed. - Were you? I wonder whose bed. - Beg your pardon? I have here your file and I can see that, in spite of brilliant academic degrees, gymnastics champion at the General Examination, University boxing champion, consolation motorcross cup winner, your love indiscretions notably impaired your career advancement. Oh, you know, I came into the career because my elders weren?t in it anymore. The Tommeraye have been in the service of diplomacy since the 40 kings who, in the space of 1000 years, made the Republic. And that?s why my predecessor, an old school diplomat, favoured you. But I?m part of the new wave, a technocrat. I?m warning you: everything is going to change. From now on, I require of all services that... I?m carrying my service out to the limits of exhaustion, with the same steadfastness that my forebears displayed. You?re newly arrived in C?te d?Ivoire, Mr Delegate, and you probably don?t know it yet, but Africa is in turmoil. A very hard diplomatic game has started: I must have drunk 624 cocktails in the space of a fortnight. - Does that say anything to you? - A superhuman feat. But I?m going to ask you for a little extra effort. I perused the list of the passengers aboard the 12:30 plane and noticed the name of Miss Papin-Leterrier who published an authoritative book on African butterflies. I really can picture her. She must have iron-rimmed spectacles and large feet. Large feet or not, you?ll take an Embassy car in order to welcome her at 12:30, when she leaves the plane. This is inconvenient: I?m supposed to have lunch with the Swedish cultural attach?. Hey, Herv?. Here I am, Darling. My one and only love. A horrible setback. - We can?t have lunch together. - Oh, damn! And I called the reporters! The reporters? For a t?te-?-t?te? Well, yes, in order to announce our engagement. But... I have no intention of marrying you. I have none either, sweetie pie. It?s for my publicity. So sorry to disappoint you, but I?m on an official mission: I must fetch someone at the airport. - A woman, of course. - Oh no. No, she?s an intellectual. You know, I?d do anything to escape that chore. There?s nothing easier, sweetie pie. Don?t move! Pictures! Very clever. He met a tragic fate. The drowned man in Vridi has been identified. He was Professor Dumont, in C?te d?Ivoire for 2 weeks to hunt butterflies. What the devil! Killer! You sadist! Ouch... - Oh, I bet you?re Miss Sapin-Leterrier. - So what? I apologize, Miss. I was so afraid I?d miss you. Just a second. Oh, so you did it on purpose to boot. Please accept these humble flowers and an invitation to dinner. - Are you free tonight? - Oh, I see, the gentleman is a flirt. - Oh, wait. I didn?t introduce myself. - Do not insist or I scream! - That young woman winked at me! - At a diplomat of such magnitude? Twisters don?t aim that high. Wouldn?t you know her, Mr de la Tommeraye? - Me? Er... no, I never met her. - Even accidentally. Such a classy chassis. Who do you think I am, Miss? A debauchee, obsessed with night clubs? Good evening, Mr de la Tommeraye. A magnum of Champagne, as usual? Thanks to you, my dear chap, Miss Sapin-Leterrier has had a lot of fun before her departure. Waiter, please! Do you know Mr Lefranc, the safari operator? Of course. When he?s not hunting in the jungle, he always comes here for entertainment. If you see him, be so kind as to tell him he?s wanted. By the Embassy. You can rely on me, Sir. Why should you hire a professional hunter? If she wishes me to, I can escort Miss Sapin-Leterrier during her expedition. Out of the question: you already took eleven months of vacation last year. And I don?t want to run any risk. Mr Lefranc was warmly recommended to me. I rely on you, Mr Delegate. Oh, don?t put on the long face. You?re probably more comfortable on the dance floor than on a forest trail. During my lonely life, as I was sent from one diplomatic post to another, I often dreamed of a celestial creature coming to shine on my dreary routine. Don?t exert yourself. I like you a lot. You?re a very good dancer. Call me Baby. The people I like call me Baby. Well, in that case, Baby, this is no time to part from each other. Impossible. I have to pick up the work of my unfortunate colleague, - Professor Dumont. - Oh, do you? I shall kiss no one... ...before I bring the tropicalis ornithopter to the museum. - The what? - The uber-rare tropical butterfly. But what about me? Where do I fit in all of this? My mission starts tomorrow. - Angry? - No. Ankle trouble. I was hurt during a head-on attack. - At war? - No: rugby. It?s bothers me when... when a storm is brewing. Oh, let me introduce Mr Renaud Lefranc. Yours to command. Any kind of safari. Will you hunt gazelles or elephants? Elephants are more eventful but gazelles are more romantic. I shall hunt butterflies. Sorry? I think you?ve got the wrong address. I do not deal in insecticide. No, my dear Lefranc, this is a scientific expedition of the utmost importance. - Funded by the State. - Oh, the State is paying? - As always. - Let?s shake on it, Miss. - When shall we leave? - Tomorrow morning. It?s a little short. Well... Nothing is impossible for Renaud Lefranc. - Everything will be ready. - Thank you Sir. - I think you?re really nice. - Thank you. - Call me Baby. - Oh, no, certainly not. No, you can?t allow that. To set a great white hunter after a game unworthy of his rifle! Don?t worry about my rifle. Speaking of game, I have the feeling that a very peculiar huntress is watching you. - Who? The pretty brunette with murder in her eye? - Indeed. - No, I don?t know who she is. - Oh, I do. Her husband was an Italian diplomat. I had him as a client before she shot him like a dog. She thought he was an elephant, she said. I must admit he was a randy devil. What is it, Mr de la Tommeraye? You?re white as a sheet. - Thank you. - You?re welcome. - Thanks for a wonderful evening. - Oh, you know... Yes, yes, you really made us laugh. Good evening then. See you soon. - Why not right now? - Well you haven?t got any hang-ups? What would my colleagues from the museum think, if they saw Miss Sapin-Leterrier entered a hotel on your arm? Oh no, Baby, no, this is disappointing. You, a sophisticated spirit, a scientist, you would refuse to have a last drink? No, I must go home alone and get to my room. Number 266. 6 is 2 times 3. Good night. Domani, at dawn, the ship will weigh anchor and I?ll have it sunk in the open sea. We?ll plunge in the undersea abyss, embraced forever and ever. No, tesoro, I am much too jealous. Come on, you can?t sink such a beautiful ship. - Oh, here she is at last. Get lost. - Good hunting. Bring us fat butterflies. Tell the Brain that he can rely on me. Here I am. Come on, quick, our gear has been taken on board. Let?s hurry. What are you waiting for? A goodbye from Mr de la Tommeraye? - Don?t mention that boor. - What did he do to you? - Nothing, but he?ll pay for it. - Come. - Your suitcase, Sir. - You didn?t forget anything? No, no, boss. - Your papers, Sir. - What papers? - Miss? The plane to Borango? - It just took off, Sir. You know the Brain?s orders? Yes, this bloke mustn?t catch up with the girl. - A taxi-plane sir? - Yes. Follow me, please. - Will we arrive soon? - Right now if you wish. Mission accomplished. The parcel has been launched over the brush. Order to all Sons of the Panther to delay by any means Jean-Luc Herv? de la Tommeraye who keeps walking North. Say, Sir. Sir! When shall we arrive? - Shall we go? - One moment. Wait, wait, someone else is coming. Hands up! Come on: sail on. Wait for me. Here I come. Hey! But... couldn?t you wait for me? - Miss Baby! - Yes. Beware. There are carnivores in the area. - But where are you? - I?m here. What are you doing here? I asked you not to stray from the trail on any account. I have to watch over you. Watch over me or watch me, Mr Lefranc? Yes, well, I know my job, Miss. One eye on the client, the other one on the game. Have a care: you?ll end up with a squint. Pardon me for not laughing, but it?s not included in my contract. - Well, where shall we go now? - This way. And now you follow me, right? What?s going on? An elephant. At least three tons, coming right at us. - Are you sure? - An old hunter is never wrong. Get behind me. And don?t be afraid. I?ll fire at the last moment: the only weakness of the monster is its ear hole. Well, Baby, that last drink... when shall we have it? Sublime, this whisky of yours. Yes, it?s got a very nice and peculiar little taste. Very individual. I must remember the brand name. A little taste of "more, please". Yes, but this is the last one, because I?m really sleepy. - In that case, good night, Miss Baby. - Good night. - See you soon. - I?d be surprised. Aren?t you going to bed? No, never. I must watch over my client?s sleep. Why don?t you take advantage of my presence and get some rest? No: the chief of a safari never sleeps. - Who?s there? - It's me. May I come in? - No, I?m butt naked. - Oh, really? Say, you seem rather bold. Not like the other night. That?s because the other night I wasn?t feeling well. All right, give me a kiss and come. Come. Poor baby, you were scared, weren?t you? I?m taking you to your parents. Baby... You don?t say. Here?s something else. Come on, come on. But what?s the problem, my dear friend. Didn?t you sleep well? Didn?t I sleep well? I must be dreaming. We slept for two days. The little bitch drugged us. Hey! The little bitch? You must be drunk. I did drink, yes. A Baby-signed whisky. And the young lady is wandering around and we don?t know where. The farmers found her near their village, 50 kilometers from here. Exhausted, with neither water nor food. But this is awful. We must go and help her. Not my problem anymore. Article 77 of Safari Rules: a client escaping and hunting without his hunter releases the hunter from his responsibilities. From this instant, if anything should happen to Miss Sapin-Leterrier, I?d call on your testimony. I wasn?t there. You, you, I don?t care about you. Where is she? She was evacuated to Borango, where she waits for a plane to Abidjan. What is the meaning of this? But it?s quite simple, Herv?. While you slept, I managed to catch my butterfly. Listen to me, Baby. I don?t want to emphasize the fact that I braved a succession of unexplainable jungle dangers, with the sole intention of having a last drink with you, in which was a soporific, but I think your explanations are somewhat lacking. Do you want proof? Here they are. My tropicalis ornithopters. Male and female. Beautiful specimens, aren?t they? You didn?t have to come all the way here, you could have found the same ones in my wardrobe. But my boy hunts them with moth-repellent. I?m appalled by your lightness of mind. If these invaluable moths agree to reproduce in captivity, what a triumph for French entomology. Gee... Oh. Oh, and you?re getting on my nerves. Do I ask you what you did on the night before we left? - It?s a secret that isn?t mine. - Why do you keep it then? - Well, because... - Miss. You have Paris on the phone. Hello? Hello? What? What? Oh, put a lid on it! I can?t hear anything in the winkle. Of course not, I?m not talking to you, boss. The kids are just practicing on some fuzz. Yes. Oh? Got it, Boss, we?ll be right there. Thank you, Boss. Ciao. The boss blows you a kiss. Come on, let?s not get mellow, take the gear aboard, - we?re going into the jungle. - Did she find the diamonds? Yeah. A regular Redskin Indian, the kid is. Nothing frightens her. Come in. - Herv?... - Yes. Do me a favour. Could I sleep with you tonight? What? Give me shelter. I?m scared when I?m alone. Oh, what a charming excuse! What a delectable trick! - Don?t you believe me? - What? Of course I believe you. These tropical nights are suffocating. Let?s get you comfortable. Will you behave! But what?s the matter? Are you really scared? Some danger threatens me, I can feel it. Remember what happened to Professor Dumont. Since I?ve got these butterflies with me, I can?t think of anything else. If that?s all. Here we are. Now you can think of something else. - No. - What do you mean, no? Now I?ll be afraid for you. Oh, no, forget the damn butterflies. Do I tell you about my troubles? Do I tell you about Ambassador Rouffignac, to whom I spoke on the phone and who wants to have me transferred to Ulan Bator in Outer Mongolia. Oh, no, tiny details, when we are here, alone at last, my darling, and nothing in the world could prevent me from having that drink with you. I think I deserve it, don?t I? I?ll get some Champagne. I?ll be right back. Herv?! Gentlemen. You can?t force the Brain to leave his secret H.Q. without consequences. I came to C?te d?Ivoire in order to punish those who have failed. Let?s sum up the case. One of our planes illegally carried the diamonds we stole from the traffickers. First failure: the plane crashed in the brush. Second failure: you couldn?t find it. Third failure: apparently, someone else did. Number four! You were in charge of the operation. What have you got to say? Nothing is lost. We captured the girl. No trespassing. Come on now, get out! - Did it go well? - Yes, more or less. - What about the diplomat? - He?s out of the picture. - Good. Take her away now. - Come on. My dear child, I trust you?ll forgive the roughness of our invitation but, at this stage, I thought it essential to have a small conversation with you. I?m Miss Sapin-Leterrier, from the Natural History Museum. I refuse to talk to people who haven?t been introduced to me. Oh, no, please, not to me. We have eyes everywhere. You?re no more Miss Sapin-Leterrier than your late accomplice, Dumont, a. k. a. The Flea, was a professor. In truth, your name is Arlette Belpeau, the daughter of Roger Belpeau who was for so long a sensation in the criminal world. Number Four? What are you waiting for? Sit down! Let?s get to the point: Arlette, you found the broken plane. Where? - What plane? - Don?t play stupid games. The plane full of diamonds that we lost in the forest. Oh, did you lose it? Now that?s a piece of bad luck. Beware, we are not joking here. Calm down, calm down, Number Four. You won?t have to use your skills in order to loosen her tongue. Will he, my dear child? If you talk, I swear I?ll leave you ten percent of the cargo. What do you think I am? An agent? Beware: if you refuse my generous offer, I can?t imagine who could save you from the Panther?s claws. Certainly not your little diplomat. By the way, Number Four, what did you do with the fool? Savage! Bravo, Number Four. You hit a nerve. This is a good time to heat her feet a little: her morale is down, she will talk. - Go on. Let?s get it over with. - You murderer! - Herv?! - Pick up the revolver. Quick. Let?s go now. Take the wheel and drive, quick. - Hey, he went that way. - Hurry up! Stop shooting, we have failed. We?ll catch him further on. We must warn the Brain. Hey! Yes... You mustn?t swim around here: lots of crocs. Come on, give me your hand. Thank you very much. You?re very kind. Thank you, thank you very much. Hello, Gentlemen. - Hello. How are you? - Hello. Tell me: could you take me back to the harbour. Of course. Stay with us for the wedding. We?ll have fun. Oh, no, no, no, thank you. I?m not thirsty anymore, I?d rather have a cigarette. Here is one. Yes, yes... Listen. Mind your manners, guys. Act distinguished. We must not be noticed. We are intellectuals. - Number 266. - Hey, guys. Look at this. I?ll be damned. Whatever happened to you, dear colleague? I?ll explain. Follow me. There?s a hitch in the butterfly. A free-for-all is in order. There are vicious matadors in the area. - We can give them the final blow. - Shut your trap. - Where is the plan? - The plan? There! I repeat: bring them back alive. I say: alive. By any means. Over. Message received. Pay attention: eight, ten, twelve. I repeat: eight, ten, twelve. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye and thanks again. Goodbye. Harbour Police. The train! Ahoy! Oh, here he is. Go on,quickly! Hey, there, get your paws up! You, bring your load this way, on the double! - Come on, jump! - Herv?! Hello. Message to Heli 28. I?m told their boat is sailing toward the Vridi Canal. Do whatever is necessary: I want them both alive. Repeat: message to Heli 28. I?m told their boat is sailing toward the Vridi Canal... A Herm?s belt, a leather wallet, and a pack of French cigs. Who wants one? Come on, don?t play stupid. Where is the plan? Beware: he?s starting to have itching fingers. - If he gets up, you plunge. - No, not yet. A Tommeraye can?t be the accomplice of a criminal gang. The plan will be delivered to the Ivorian authorities. What? All this work and the local peasants would collect? - 50% of the treasure will be yours. - 50%? Let me rearrange his face! - you little demon! You?ll get us all in the water! - Silence! Look, Baby, you?re going to do me the pleasure of asking for Police protection. What? What? Are you ordering me around now? Who do you think I am, my friend? In my world, a self-respecting girl lets no sucker rule over her. - But... - What?s going on? How should I know? Put that down, you?d kill the boss. Let?s hurry now. Our diamonds are going away. - Let?s follow them. - Come on, let?s go. Put us down! Put us down! Pirates! Kidnappers! - Shut your trap! - And foul-mouthed to boot. And of course you don?t say a word. Oh, please, I?ve got enough trouble as it is. Don?t let me keep you. Just get down. Well, get down, get down... Get down! Just get down! Faster, for God?s sake. Do you really think he can hear you? Faster. Hurry up. - Get down! - The winch is jammed. This is Heli 28. Mechanical failure. Can?t get passengers up. Take message. Take measures and bring passengers alive. I repeat: bring them back alive. Over and out. Hey! Will you take us down already? Can you hear me? I order you to get down. - Shit! - What?s the matter? What are you doing? We?re beached! - Come on, guys, hurry up. - Let?s hurry. Come on. This way. Bring the sub-machine gun, quick. Hurry, hurry... He?s gone now. We need a car. Here?s one. Your move, my little Rebel Without a Cause. It?s always the same blokes who get killed. - What do you want? - Er... Abidjan... Which way? That way. It?s our lucky day. Just what we needed. - What can we do now? - Wait for another car. This is the Police. Repeat: this is the Police. Heli 28: put down your passengers unharmed. Do it right now! - If they think we?re going to surrender just like that. - You bet. This way now! Everybody out! Come on, come on Come on, hurry up. Dominique! Take the wheel and turn the car around. We?re off. Come on. Come on, split! The Police! - You?re going to get down now! - Shut up! - Take us down. - Hey, the plane, there. This is the Police. Last warning: put your passengers down now! I?m really fed-up of being carried around like this. Do something. Kiss me. - What? In front of everybody? - So what? Hey, we?re being shot at. - You dirty womanizer. - But I repeat that I barely know her. For a start, you?ll give me back my plan. - I don?t carry your plan on me. - Liar. Miss Belpeau, as sure as I?m a gentleman, one more word and I slap you. I?ll kill you both! - Oh, you! - E alora? This is Heli 28, this is Heli 28, impossible to escape from the Police. Waiting for new instructions. Over and out. This is the Brain. Put down your passengers on the Adjam? Plaza. I repeat: put down your passengers on the Adjam? Plaza. This is the Brain. Over and out. - Compliments, Mr de la Tommeraye. - Thank you, Gentlemen. Oh, Mr Rouffignac... - What a pleasant surprise. - You?re going to explain... I?ll be with you in one moment. - No, if you don?t mind, I... I... - One moment, please. We barely escaped, and the Panther hasn?t said its last word. Whether you like it or not, I?m putting you under police protection. Bastard. - Oh, hello, Mr First Commissioner. - Hello. What happened? Well, the thing is, as we both came out of the Embassy... - Baby... - The kid is exhausted. Let me take her where she can rest. You may interrogate her later. - All right. - Help me carry her to my car. - Lift her. - Careful, careful. This scandal will deserve a few explanations, Mr de la Tommeraye. Oh, shut up, this is not the right time. - What shall we do? - Let?s follow them. But, Mr Delegate, this is not the way to the Embassy. We?re not going to the Embassy but to a place reserved for little indiscreet diplomats. - What does that mean? - Do not move. I can now satisfy your legitimate curiosity. I?m not Delegate Rouffignac. The real Rouffignac never reached C?te d?Ivoire. I regretted killing such a good-mannered man but, to take back the diamonds from the plane under the Police?s collective nose, I needed an unquestionable cover. Who would have looked for the Brain at the Embassy? You?re the bastard who offed the Flea. So you were the chief of the Panther... You?re too subtle to live a long life. - No, not him. Not him. - Very moving. As soon as you help me find my diamonds, you?ll join your little diplomat in a better world. I?m not that mean. Be careful: we?re being followed. - So we meet again. - Don?t we? - Where is the plan? - The plan? Baby has it. - We must catch up with them, quick. - In the car! That?s it. We?re stuck in the sand. Everybody out. What?s going on? Hey, guys, hurry-up, get out of the car. Come on. Come on, push! It?s done. In the car, quick. They've disappeared. Dammit. Where have the ugly bastards gone? Well, we?re screwed. I?m really fed up with you and your African campaigns. I?m sitting down in the shade. What?s happening to you? Hey, they got away this way. OK, I?ve got to finish my work with the lady. Number Four, take care of those who would disturb us. All right. Now! You this way, and you that way. Believe me, you?re going to tell me where the plane is. Guys, there?s mayhem in the air. Trust to my nose. This is too deserted to be honest. Here, park there. A diplomat has more than one trick in his briefcase. We?re going to send them an official letter. Come on. Careful... Let?s go! Come on, hurry up, split! Those little craftsmen of crime wanted to play stupid, they?ll see what attacking a technocrat will cost them. Hey, stupid! Watch out! Brain! It?s up to you and me. Now we?ve got you, don?t we, Brain? You can?t attack diplomacy without any consequences. Hands up! Number four! Take the little rabid girl away, now. Come on, take her away. And you, little diplomat, come this way. Come on, move. And now, who?s turn is it? Mind the cops, guys! - That, one day or another... - ... was meant to happen. Oh, my darling, you can ask me anything. - Well, I?ll ask for the plan. - What? Bravo, Gentlemen, bravo. Come on. Compliments, Gentlemen. You are good people. We need a lot of men like you. - Commissioner! - Yes. What is it? Commissioner. There?s a cigarette worth a billion in this pack. - But... - Catch, Commissioner. Thank you. I know all about it. I?ll put it in a safe place. Goodbye, Gentlemen, goodbye. But he got away with our plan. Can you believe this? What about our 50 percent? - We?ll take it back. - You?re crazy: we?re not messing with the Police. No, but we can talk. Commissioner! Commissioner! And thanks again. - What shall we do then? - We must catch up with them. - In the car, quick! - Give me the crank. Well, darling, when shall we have that drink? Just after the word " End ".
