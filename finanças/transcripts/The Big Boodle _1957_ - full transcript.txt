- What do you do when you're not dealing cards? - Shuffle them. - I think you also hypnotize them. - Card? - Ace of spades. Sudden death. - For that, senora, you can buy insurance. Have a bet. - I never buy insurance on cards, all my life. - Sir? Card? Senora? Your pleasure? Pardon, senorita. 21. - What is the house limit at this table? - 500 pesos. - I have not looked at my cards. I will make you a small personal bet, just between you and me, that this time I win. - I'm a dealer, senorita, not a gambler. - Yes, I thought so. I stand with 19. - 20. I pay 21. 10 minutes. Senorita, may I borrow your handkerchief. The ink, you know, it's still wet. - Ink? - Mm. From these. These freshly printed, these. 500 Cuban pesos. That's $500 American, a sum for which I have a certain grudging respect. - You are making a lot of nonsense. - More sense than your money makes, senorita. You see, senorita, if a dealer accepts counterfeit money, and the passer walks away from the table, all he can do is just press it in his scrapbook. He's stuck with it personally. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Look. I'm ready to believe you didn't know this was funny money. Why don't you just give me 500, used. And I'll give you this, and you can paste it in your scrapbook. - If this is my money, why didn't you stop me inside? - Perhaps you were too quick for me. Perhaps I didn't want to embarrass you. - And perhaps this is a little business you run for yourself. I think for 500 pesos, you would embarrass your own godfather. - I haven't got a godfather, but I do have 500 counterfeit pesos. - Then you had them before I came to the casino, and you will have them after I leave. - Polizia! Polizia! Polizia! - Lucky. You should light a candle to your luck. A few inches over, and you'd have the bullet in your heart. - Will you be able to identify them? - Only by their feet. - Strange. Simple hold-up, but to beat you like that. - Maybe they needed the exercise. - All right. Have the dressing changed in four days. - How do I get my face changed, sir? - Advice. Next time a man points a gun at you, make him feel welcome. - I can't remember the Spanish word for "welcome." - Take him to the colonel. - Sit down. Feeling better? - I'll be working on the bias a while, I guess. - A man is not a man until he's caught at least one bullet. - Catch it in the right place, and a man isn't a man, period. - Tell US. - What? - How it happened. - Well, I was walking into the building, and they jumped me, that's all. - They were there waiting for you? They didn't speak? No word, hold-up, nothing? Just jumped you. Waited for you and jumped you. Why should they wait for you? You're a dealer, not a player, not a money-flasher. Just a little nothing dealer with maybe only some jingle money in your pants. So why should they invest time and risk, and wait for you and jump you for only some jingle money? - Remember me? I'm the citizen who got slugged. Why don't you pick up the two thugs and ask them the why? Nice and polite, you know? Maybe you'll get the answer. - I think you will give me the answers. I think you'll give me all the answers we both need. Like, perhaps you were carrying an unusual amount of money with you tonight? Unusual for you? - I was carrying some money. - Like this? Unusual money like this? You must admit this is truly unusual money. - I can explain that. - You will explain by answering my questions. Havana police headquarters, fill in the date. Questioning of ned Sherwood by colonel Guillermo mastegui, chief secret section, Cuban national police. That is me, colonel mastegui. I am colonel mastegui. Present: United States treasury agent a. Griswold. What is your full name? - Ned Sherwood. - American citizen? - Yep. - Born where? - Boston. - What's your address in Havana? - The monte vista apartments. - Where do you work? - You know where I work. - For the record. - For the record, casino. Dealer. - How long? - Two years. - Ever work as a dealer before. - Yes. Reno, Las Vegas, couple of years at monte Carlo. - Chicago? - Chicago? - For a man called blackie Norton? - No. - When were you in the states last? - About two years ago. - In Chicago? - Yes. I went to a funeral there. - Whose? - A dead man's. - What was his name? - Mike Barlow. - What business was he in? - He was my partner. - What did he die of? - A bullet. He was shot. It's on the record. - By you? - No. By my wife. - Did you ever know blackie Norton? - No. - Sam naylor? Adam berger? - Ever use an alias? - Nope. - Been arrested before? - What do you mean before? Am I arrested now? - Answer the question. - Never. - I'll check with the FBI. Tell them we'll telephoto his prints and mug shots. - Wait a minute. Answer me this. Am I arrested now or not? - That depends on your answer. Where did you get this counterfeit money? - At the casino. - How? - A player passed it on me. - Do you know the player? - No. A woman. - Did you call her on it? - No. Too late. She walked away from the table, then denied it. I was stuck. - Did you report it to the pit boss? - No. - A yes would have surprised me. - When a player passes queer money, the dealer's stuck with it. - You're stuck with it because you made it. Where did you get the plates, Sherwood? - You got them from Sam naylor, didn't you? But you found out fast the Chicago ring wouldn't stand still for a cross. They sent Roscoe down to give you the boot. - I can't even keep track of the cast of characters. - We're keeping track. We hit blackie Norton in Chicago, and he spilled. Tell me this. Just who and where did you expect to push that size boodle? Not passing 500 at a time, not in 10 casinos. - The plates, Sherwood. Where are they? You're between two knives, Sherwood, the Chicago boys and me. Make up your mind which one is gonna cut deeper. - You've lost me. - Not yet. But when I do, it'll be for good. I'm booking you on possession of counterfeit. Sanchez. - Vamos. - This is griswold. Get me the FBI, Washington. - One more thing. I'm a quiet man. Lead a quiet life, got a quiet job. And you can put this down for the record too, buster. I don't go pushing people around, and I don't like getting pushed around. And I've given up the business of hating people a long time ago. But in your case, I'll make an exception. I know your type. Those fish eyes. A bunch of muscles with a badge. From now on, brother, I wouldn't even tell you what city we're in. - Maybe you can deal, dealer, but you don't like them dealt to you. - Not when I don't know the game. - Sherwood. Ned Sherwood. - You know, for a quiet guy who leads a quiet life and works at a quiet job, you certainly have a loud connection on the outside without even a telephone call, eh? - I am Miguel salcito, attorney at law. I am here to arrange for your release on bail. - Sherwood, I can make it very bad for you, but I won't. I'm gonna let you walk. And you know why? Because you're gonna find it a lot tougher on the outside. But you'll be back, either to sing or on a slab. He can't leave Havana. - Sherwood, sign here. - He would not attempt to leave the city. - Hey. - Forgive me. I am pressed for time. I bid you adios, senor. - Now wait a minute. Slow down, amigo. Who did it? - Did it? - Yeah. Who put up the bail bond? - Forgive me. I'm pressed for time and-- - yeah, I'm pressed for answers. Who sent you? - Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous. - Not good enough. Who was it? - If you do not wish to accept this act of philanthropy, you are free immediately to apply for re-admission to your cell. Adios, senor. - Come all the way in, senor. It is, after all, your apartment. - Make yourself at home. But leave my household art alone. - Idiota. You're about to destroy a thing of beauty, a priceless antiquity. I've observed that you're a man of wide culture, senor Sherwood. You'll find that we share many tastes. - Which one of them brings you here? - There are fleas and lice in the prison cells. Perhaps you would like to shower before we talk, eh? - I'll only have to take another one after you leave. Let's get to the point. - To the point. Where did you get the money? - Every day between 2:00 and 4:00, I stand outside the dog track with a tin cup. - Be polite, huh? I'm polite to you, so please, please be polite or before I'm through with you, you'll need that tin cup. - You know a citizen called mastegui? He's tough, really tough. After him, you look like a cream puff in the sun. Oh, tell that boy scout to put that thing away, will you, before he cuts himself. Okay, what are you after? - Cooperation. That is what I am after. I offer you mine and I ask for yours. - Go on. I'm listening. - Last night, you were worked over. The police found 500 pesos counterfeit on you, like these, the serial numbers all beginning with xl700, running in series. Now, where did you get that money? - I'll keep these just for reference, okay? Who are you? - I'm the man who holds the copyright on that series. - Ah. So you'd like to know what I said to mastegui. - What you told mastegui, you could put inside the shell of a chili pepper. - Next time you drop in, why don't you bring a chili pepper. - Nobody passed that money on you, and you know why? It's a limited edition. There's only one way you could get it: Illegal printing from the original plates. In law, that would be called an infringement of my copyright. - Maybe somebody else has a piece of that copyright. Naylor, for instance. - So naylor. And Adam berger. They kept a plate and they will be very sorry. They don't know how sorry. Tell this to naylor and berger. I'm willing to forget their carelessness if the plates are in my hands within 24 hours. If not, they will not leave Havana alive. - How do they find you? - You find them. I'll find you. - Hello? - Mr. Sherwood? - Yes. Who's calling? - Can you meet me this evening at 6:00? - Why? - On business. - What kind? - Money, a certain kind. - You know where you can find me. Same Blackjack table, same 500 peso limit. - I'll wait for you at El sitio. - Rough time, eh, ned? - I've had it better. - Sit down. Luck. - Luck. - Read about you. They hurt you bad? - Oh, no. Just a couple of playful tourists, I guess. - Yes. Well... - You bail me out? - No. You don't know who? That's funny. - A million laughs. - Luck. - Luck. - Little vacation'd do you good. Get away for a while. - Can't afford it. - Best medicine. - Better medicine? Work. - Condition you're in, can't work like that. Your face. - I deal with my hands. Okay, let's have it. You've had your orders. - Ned, understand. - From the boss, huh? - Please, ned. You know I swear by you, but a gambling casino... What can I do? A dealer arrested for counterfeit possession. Bad, ned. Bad. Bad for everybody. - Oh, sure. I'll go right home and have a good cry for everybody. - Give it time. Let it cool off. - I can't work, and I can't leave Havana. How do I eat while it's cooling off? - Let me stake you. - No, thanks. Mastegui figures I can always print my own. - Yes, I'm the assistant manager at the casino. - Yes, senor. - Last night, a lady left her bag there. She had a lot of money in it, but no identification except this. The linen shop around the corner said that you'd made it. Naturally, we'd like to return the bag. Perhaps you could tell US who ordered the handkerchief. - Oh, yes. This is a special order, this handkerchief. He orders them by the dozen. - He? - For gifts for his ladies. Senor rubi, at this address. Perhaps he can tell you which of his ladies this one went to. - Thank you very much. - De nada, senor. - Good-bye. - Senor rubi? - Senor rubi is not at home. - Thanks. I'll wait. Senor rubi? I think you ought to get rid of that man out there. He lies about you. - Can't the casino wait? I told delgado I'd pay next month. - I didn't come here about your losses. Last night, a lady left her bag at the casino. No identification, except we traced this handkerchief to you. - I give dozens of such handkerchiefs to dozens of ladies. - Can you give US a few names? - Their husbands might not like it. - She might like her bag back. - You can bring it to me. - It's got a lot of money in it. - I could use some money. - Not this you couldn't. It's counterfeit. - Then I suggest you go to the police. - How many times do you expect to bail me out in one day? - Senor. - I'd like to see senor salcito. - Your name, please. - Just say I came from senor rubi. - Senor rubi. Si, senor. - You know the name, of course. - I never remember names, senor. - You must be a great help to your boss. - Si, senor. That is why I'm a great help to my boss. - That figures. Just tell him I'm here, will you? - Si, senor. When he returns, I will tell him. - When will that be? - Oh, about 5:00... One month from today. There's another office through that door, senor, but you will also find him absent. - He's liable to be present. - He went to Puerto Rico to visit his old mother. She's celebrating the birth of a new son, her 14th. Isn't that wonderful? - Yeah, marvelous. Well, you tell the old son if I don't see him tomorrow morning, she'll only have 13. - Colonel mastegui, please. - He's not in. - Tell him it's important. Ned Sherwood. Sherwood. - You were bailed out this morning. - That's right. I want to see him. Important. - The colonel will be back at 6:00. - By 6:00? I might not be alive by 6:00. - Follow police officers, please. - Sherwood? - Jai alai. Very good for the liver. My father played it every day of his life. Died right there on that court. 67 years old. You should try it. - Yeah, for me to reach 67 is gonna take more than jai alai. Last night, I was almost kicked to death. An hour ago, somebody tried to do the same job with a car. - So? - So I'm a moving target. You're a policeman. How about doing some policing? - File a complaint. It'll go through the proper channels. - Look, you're not gonna use me for bait. I'm not in the hero business. You either protect me or stick me back in the jug. - Remember me, amigo? The muscle with a badge. The badge says I have to uphold the law. The law says you're out on bail. Okay, law. I uphold you. Sherwood stays out on bail. - The law also says Sherwood is entitled to protection. - That is a police matter, and I decide all police matters. Besides, you haven't convinced me yet that your life is in danger. - How do I convince you? Wink at you from a slab in the morgue. - Yes, maybe that would convince me. Maybe a little cooperation would convince me too. - You got all the cooperation from me last night. - Then you have nothing to worry about. - Oh, no. Of course not. All I need to do is get cut down. - When that happens, I'll find the cutter, and he'll cooperate. - Mr. Sherwood? I'm alone. - Get up. Sit here. - Why did you do that? - You look better facing this way. You're not what I expected. - Well, what did you expect? - Not you. Your phone call this morning didn't make much sense. - Then why did you meet me? - Lady, I represent money anonymous, on call 24 hours a day. We answer every call for help. You did want to talk about money, didn't you? - Yes. - What kind of money? We use French francs, lira, Russian rubles, anything. - What do you use for pesos? - These. - Excellent plates. - Mm-hm. Made at home with loving hands. - Whose home and whose hands? - I don't think money anonymous could be much help to you. You're too far gone. - Gone just far enough to want to buy the currency. All you can deliver. Oh, and the plates. - You make a very pretty front. Whose? - I'll tell that to the people behind you. - No, you won't. You'll tell it to me, or you'll tell it to mastegui. Anita ferrer. - I didn't handle it very well, did I? - Well, amateur. Come on, give. Who are you? - I'd rather tell you than mastegui. Come with me. - Where? - To meet my people. Afraid? - Not now. - Papa? Mr. Sherwood, this is my father. - Ah, welcome to my house, senor. Anita. Senor Sherwood, in the evening, I enjoy a little Brandy with my cigar. I hope you will join me. It is a Spanish Brandy. Naturally, those accustomed to the French brandies might find it a bit robust, but everyone can acquire a taste for it. Your health, senor. - Father, you were right. He threatened to take me to mastegui. - I thought you would. - How would I know she wasn't sent by mastegui? - A possibility. - What do you expect? First stranger I meet, "why certainly, lady. "I'm loaded with counterfeit. Got a special sale on it." - Permit me to explain, senor. Colonel mastegui asked me if I knew a casino dealer named Sherwood. I did not. My impetuous daughter Anita overheard and took matters in her own hands. Now I'm just as glad she did. - I can understand mastegui's interest. How about yours? - It is not frivolous, senor. - Mr. Sherwood, my father is president of bank of Cuba. - If you were to say you were Napoleon, I wouldn't ask you for proof. - It would be very difficult for me to prove I am Napoleon. However, if you care to check my handwriting against the signature on any personal note, please do so. - Perhaps this might help. - So the president of Cuba calls you his dear friend. Mastegui calls me a crook, a thief, a counterfeiter. With your connections and my reputation, I think we ought to go into business. - A brief partnership might prove mutually helpful. Please sit, senor. I will try to explain. Of course, in order to understand any of this, you must first understand mastegui. His life dedicated only to one end: The pursuit and destruction of criminals. I have no personal fondness for him, but-- - well, that's one thing we share in common. We both despise mastegui. - Ah, but you are wrong, senor. I do not despise him. I respect him. He is the only completely incorruptible man I have ever met. He trusts no one. He suspects everyone. He suspects me. - That's a suspicious cop. - And not without reason. You see, he happens to know that my personal fortune had taken a turn for the worse not long ago. I am no bankrupt, but I am poorer because I have accepted the presidency of the banco nacional. - Which happens to issue the national currency. - Mr. Sherwood, the car is where we left it. - Allow him his skepticism, Anita. My failing has always been my lack of moderation. When I served my country in other posts, I see, now that I look back, I did so at a severe cost to my family. However, you see now why mastegui thinks it is possible that I may be involved. - For a few hundred pesos? - No, senor. For 3 million pesos. - That's a king-sized suspicion. - Some weeks ago, United States treasury agents in Chicago uncovered a counterfeit operation. But not American dollars. Cuban pesos. 3 million Cuban pesos. The plates and the counterfeit money have not yet been uncovered. Mastegui's convinced there is only one channel through which such a vast amount of money can be passed: The Cuban bank. And I am forced to agree with him. - And for that, I'll never forgive him. - Anita, please. After a lifetime of difficult honesty, I do not wish to be the man who has permitted 3 million counterfeit pesos to be foisted on the public. - Senor, your predicament is very touching. But I'm much more touched by my own. - And you forgive me if I am more concerned with a situation affecting 6 million people. A scandal such as this might destroy the people's confidence in their government. This time, the Cuban people have a good government. - People get the kind of government they deserve. Right now, I'm fighting for a party of one: Me. I told mastegui the truth. - Reserving, perhaps, enough information to protect someone else? - Colonel mastegui. - Forgive me, senor director. But I did not know you were holding a budget meeting. - What do you want this time, colonel? - A cigar. A kind word. A smile. I'm very easily satisfied. - I can offer you a cigar. - Then I will have to get a smile and a kind word from senor Sherwood. Oh, no, please. It is not necessary for you to explain to me what he is doing here. After all, even the president of the bank of Cuba has a right to choose his own guests. - Yet there are times, it seems, when I have no choice. - I am at your service, senor director. When I go, I will take Sherwood with me, if you wish. - Try it. - Sherwood is my guest. - A casino dealer charged with possession of counterfeit, a guest in your house. - I believe you're wrong about senor Sherwood on all counts. - Am I wrong about you, Sherwood? I think not. In fact, if I were to search you now, I'm sure I'd find more counterfeit in your possession. But I won't search him because I might have to arrest him again. And I want him free, free as a pigeon. - You've got the wrong bird, haven't you? You mean a sitting duck. - Senor Sherwood's life is in grave danger. Now, you may be pushing an innocent man to his death. - If that happens, senor ferrer, I will light seven candles to his memory. - You have any more questions, ask them. I'll try to answer. - Well, just the one. From whose hand did this-- - you want to know what I told mastegui? - Yes, a woman at the casino. - You have never seen her before? - Or since. - You know, I'm beginning to think that this money was passed by mistake. They tried to recover it and kill you before you had a chance to identify the woman who passed it. - I tried to give it back to her. She wouldn't take it. I guess she was afraid I might blow the whistle on her if I did. - Probable. I don't envy you your life expectancy, senor. Yet, though I never expected it, meeting you has given me hope. - I wouldn't hope too much if I were you. Mastegui told you I was a dealer in the casinos. - It is what you were before you became a dealer that interests me. - What was I? - I cannot give chapter or verse, but I would say that you have fought worthier battles than this one. And I wonder why and when you ever chose to retire behind a gambling table. The only position, it occurs to me, senor, that rules you out of the game. - Yet mastegui was right about one thing, father. If he would have searched our friend, he would have found counterfeit. - Calling cards. From two strong-armed visitors. - Cuban visitors? - Yeah, both of them. You told mastegui you'd made up your mind about me. Those make any difference? - Come to see me when you have something to say to me, senor. And please count on me if I can help you. - I think I'll do that. - Ah, so you've finally decided to spend an evening at home. That makes me very happy. Allow me to present my daughter Josefina, senor Sherwood. - Senorita. - Senor Sherwood compromiso. Tell me, my dear. Now where have you been spending all this time? I have not seen... - I'll see you out, senor. Take my car. I'll pick them up tomorrow. - Very nice meeting your people. Very interesting family. - Thank you. - You heard? I'm a satisfactory middle man, huh? - None better. Much obliged. - She accepted so quickly. Why did you need me? - Lately even the sound of my voice seems to upset people. - Seriously, ned. If your run of bad luck has re-awakened your courting instincts, then it isn't all bad. A dealer must be discreet. But a dealer who never gambled, even on women... Good luck. - It's still bad. - You say somebody jumped you. People are always jumping you. You lead a quiet life, and everybody else is an athlete, huh? - You mean you're still not convinced somebody's trying to kill me. - Only what I see convinces me. Here I see you standing alive in front of me, and the man you claimed attacked you is in the hospital close to death. - You identified him as a professional killer. - Well, you certainly made an amateur out of him. How about those counterfeit bills we found on you? - I've already told you that story. - You know, if I bring you in here enough times, maybe I'll collect the whole 3 million pesos, peso by peso, eh? - Very funny. You've fixed it so I can't work in Havana, and I can't leave. Now, you either stick me in jail so I don't worry about who else is going to get hurt... - Or? - Or let me alone. You need a decoy. I'm it. Why don't you take your men off my back? Let me try it my way for, let's say 24 hours. What have you got to lose? - Very interesting. This morning, at the jai alai, you begged for protection. - Right. - Tonight, you want to go it alone. So you love life more or less? - Just enough to learn who's trying to kill me. - I don't make pacts with criminal suspects. Protect yourself. - Thanks, I think. - Mr. Sherwood. Thank you. - For what? - Thank you for last night when you said nothing. - Thank your father. I couldn't hit him with it, not right between the eyes. - Drink? Who hurt you like that? - You tell me. Be sure to make it good. You shoved counterfeit at me. I get shot and stabbed, arrested, mugged, and printed. Bailed out, set up, knocked down. I'm through bouncing. You're going to open up, and I'm not settling for any cheap tears. - Since that night at the casino, I've not slept. - That makes two of US. So you knew it was counterfeit? - Not then. When I found out, I wanted to come to you. - You didn't. - I was afraid. - I'll bet. The first night, you set the thugs on me. - No. - The next night, you bailed me out for another crack. - Please, it's not true. - After I left last night, you got on the phone and arranged to have me carved up when I got in. - Believe me. Please believe me. I had nothing to do with that. At the casino, I did not know the money was counterfeit. And when I read what happened to you yesterday, i-- - where did you get it? - I don't know. - Where did you get the money? - I don't know yet. - We're not doing each other any good. - Where are you going? - To my second home, colonel mastegui's office. Where else? - Please give me a little time. - What do you need time for when a little truth would do? - But I do not have it yet. I need time. - Time is what I'm short on. I live at the monte vista, as if you didn't know. You be there at 10:00 or I'll be at mastegui's office at 10:15. - I'll be there. - Maybe this is why I didn't talk last night. Telephone, por favor. Gracias. Senorita Anita ferrer, por favor. - Mr. Sherwood. You know something? - Until I met your father last night, I'd forgotten men like him existed. It wasn't just his 3 million pesos worth of trouble which made him seem bigger. He seemed bigger. - What are you trying to tell me? - I found the woman. - Who gave you the--who? - Fina. - Fina? - Last night, I figured it would be a little too much for your father, so I kept quiet. - It can't be. Fina? It can't be. - So I guess they were both right, your father and mastegui. The currency was, no is, supposed to be channeled through the Cuban bank. - But what--my father. How can you prepare him for this? I assure you it would kill him. What can we do? Is there anything to do? - I don't know. But I do know that if mastegui guesses that fina touched those pesos, he's gonna throw the book at your father. How close are you, you and fina? - Not as close as sisters should be, perhaps. We are--we always have been different. Fina was always a little wild, but then we both run wild after our mother died. We used to play on morro castle, the lighthouse, the dungeons. Walls all over. We'd risk out lives and call it play. Fina would dare anything. I was the one who worried about her. Father was too busy then. Later, at school, there was always some trouble or other, and I would try to cover up for her to save father pain. - But this time you can't cover up for her. - Just let the police catch up with her? You can't mean that. - Not unless we can scare or shake the names of her playmates out of her before mastegui works it the other way. Or use her for bait. - I'm afraid I don't understand. - I'm a walking decoy, except tonight I lost my shadow. Tonight, I'm taking your sister dancing. - A strange joke at a strange time. - Fina and I are going to hit every cantina in town. Maybe someone somewhere along the line will recognize me with the lady who passes the queer money. - I see. It's a risk, a terrible one. More for you. For fina too. But fina must take care of herself this time. - If she crashes through tonight, she'll still be in trouble. But there might be a way out. If not, I suggest we start worrying about your father. - And about you. - About me? Just offer my favorite prayer. Good luck or bad, let's get it over fast. Who is it? - Fina. - Uh-huh. Too beautiful to be true. - I have nothing to tell you, nothing nice. - You asked me for time, and I gave it to you, the whole day for nothing. That beautiful you're not. Just give me the name. I'll do the rest. Then why did you come here? - I'm not sure. It was not easy to come. Harder to stay away and wonder what you were going to do. - I told you what I was going to do. You remember. I think I'll teach you a lesson. Never say die. You want time? Okay. I'll give it to you. More time, the whole evening. Except you're gonna spend it with me. We're going to take a whirl around the town from club to cantina, just ned and fina on their first big date. I shall even try to be a little nervous. Make like a couple of kids. You know, laugh, dance, drink. Why, we might even kiss a little, like this. Maybe before the night's over, you might even grow up. Senorita. - Will I be able to finish this one? We left the other four places so suddenly. - When I go, I go. The story of my life. - I think I would be afraid to hear the story of your life. - You're dead right. Dance? - Now, tell me. What are you looking for? - The exit. I seem to need them lately. - You're wondering when the next attack will happen, aren't you? - If you think that, why did you come out with me? - Maybe perhaps I'm more curious than you are about when possibly and who. - Knowing the answers in advance ought to make you feel pretty good. You're either the cleverest witch alive or the unluckiest. - If I'm lucky enough to live through this nightmare, will I ever forget it? You have never forgotten, have you? Tell me, what was it? - You're asking for the story you didn't want to hear? - I want to hear it now. Please tell me. - Okay. I had a friend. We worked together, turned a small gamble into a big business, wheat speculation. You know, that's legally gambling with somebody else's money. I left money in his hands because he was my friend and he asked me to and I trusted him. I also had a wife. She ran off with my friend, and they took the money with them. When he finally ditched her, she killed him and killed herself. I repaid all the money and closed up shop. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - What for? You don't have to be so sorry. Remember me? I'm the zombie behind the Blackjack table. The trouble is you can't keep dealing. I suddenly find myself dealing for my life. Healthy exercise it isn't, except I think I'm beginning to feel alive again. Excuse me. Right back. - He'd be in mastegui's office already if I'd refused. - Let's not have any more of your touching confidences, fina. - Are you warning me? You know I'll be care-- - hi. Ah, the young man in the linen supply business. Why didn't you tell me what I wanted to know? Save time. Found her anyway. - Why should I have helped you, senor? Since when have we latins been generous with our women? - Figures. - When did you see rubi? Why? - You're curious. I borrowed this from you at the casino, remember? Traced it to him. Now, why don't you tell me why you're protecting him? - I'm not protecting him. - Can't say I blame you, covering up for your boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. - Why else would he buy you these by the dozen? - It is Anita he buys gifts for. It is Anita he has promised to marry. She was with US earlier that night. She borrowed my lipstick, I borrowed her handkerchief. - Anita didn't pass me any phony pesos. Are you actually trying to pass the buck to her? - No, I'm saying that rubi's her boyfriend. - Spoiled rotten all your life. Always getting into messes. Counting on her to bail you out. - It is her handkerchief. Rubi's not my boyfriend. Yes. Anita was with you when I came home last night. So they went-- rubi, father, Anita. - Your father? How does he figure? - It all began when I took 500 pesos from rubi's pocket at the casino. When I told him I lost it gambling, he went half crazy. Then I knew you were right. He told me that my father was involved, that I had to protect him. - That leaves me quite a choice. I can believe you, your father, or your sister. - Once, when the three of US were children, Anita wanted to be alone with rubi on El morro. She did this, and left me there in a hiding place. She came back later to rescue me, and found me nearly dead. That's the only time she ever saved me from anything. The messes? Not mine. The rescuing? All mine except that once. - It's just occurred to me. These seats might be getting a little hot. Let's find Anita. No, no. Not that way. Play it safe. Whatever happens around those street corners is my fault. Whatever you turn out to be, I'm sorry. - Get in the car. Quick! - I regret, senorita Josefina, that you won't tell me how you came to be involved in this difficulty. - I can tell you that, senor whatever your name is. I made the same mistake, baited the wrong sister. - Watch them while I clear the way. - I'm crazy about your friend. Who's that one? - Miguel collada. He works for my father. He has for many years. - I only met your father once, but I believe in him. - He has been overworked, tired, and sick. - Quickly. How much do you know, hmm? Are you clever like your sister? - I'm my father's daughter too. Don't use that tone with me. - Keep the girl quiet and out of trouble until I need her. - Sherwood. Sherwood, do you hear me? - Hear you. - The last time, I tried to warn you. I was patient. I was polite. - Nice, polite, patient. - But you lied to me, eh? The Chicago men, Leroy and berger, they are not even in Havana. - Maybe waiting for the tourist season. - Now you will tell me everything I want to know, but first the truth. What has this fina to do with you? - Fina. Ah. Old friends talking about old times. - Now you will tell me the truth about where you got the money. - You're wasting time and muscle, collada. I don't know anything. - Except ferrers and who gave you the money. Useful things. So I know you can help me. You can, you must, you will. - Carlos? I've been waiting to hear. - Then hear. Collada's with the dealer and fina. - Collada? But how did that happen? - Who knows? It happened. Can you put your hands on enough money to fly US out of here? - Carlos, stop that. I'll wait for you in tulipan, the same place. Do you understand? - Yes. - You are a dealer of cards, surely no friend of the law. Surely in no position to refuse the hand of friendship, which I offer you for the last time. - The heavy hand of friendship. - Full of money. - That sounds friendlier, but if you'll excuse me, I have no interest in new pesos. - Old money. Beautiful, filthy old pesos like this one. - I thought you were the man with the copyright on the new money. I don't understand. When I don't understand, I don't cooperate. - Once a year, at 4:00 on the 6th day of the 8th month, under my personal supervision, the Cuban bank burns old, retired pesos. Tomorrow, today, is the 6th day of the 8th month. These, senor, are the new pesos. 3 million of them, chemically aged, officially bound and sealed. The bundles stacked at the bank are exactly like these, except that the pesos are old. It has been precisely planned and timed. At 4:00, the bundles are switched, and these will go up in smoke. And the old pesos, 3 million of them and each one authentic, will live to a riper, dirtier old age in our pocket. - My hat's off to you. The only foolproof counterfeit killing. - So beautiful. Every shred of evidence will be destroyed. The plates, by acid. And the counterfeit itself by fire. - I can see what a shock it must have been when those 500 floating pesos meant that the plates were still around. - That I forgot the lesson of a lifetime. You want something done right, do it yourself. Senor, I'm ready to pay for what you know. The one thing. Where are the plates? - But you already have the pesos. - But I don't have the pesos. Not until the counterfeit is burned, and I can't burn it. I can't risk burning it while there still existed one piece of evidence. You must help me find those plates, senor, before those plates send me to prison. - Heavens. There'll be currency, plates, people. - That is what makes everything so bloody. Oh, no threat. Ours is a business arrangement. Now, would 100,000 pesos persuade you to cooperate? No time for bargaining. 500,000 pesos. - Good offer. I ought to buy it. The only problem is I don't know where the plates are. Another thing, I can't remember where I got the money. - Then we will shake your memory up. - So I took them. It's done. - Why didn't you tell me about it sooner? These two days have driven me out of my mind. - Because I knew you would act exactly the way you're acting. - How else? At least there would have been time to reach collada. You know what a frightened bureaucrat he really is. Now he's looking out for himself and all because of your insane, fantastic-- why did you keep the plates? And then to carry the money on you. How could you, Carlos? - Do you know what it's like to live the way we do? Go where we go and never any money in our pockets? - Why? Why? Why couldn't we just get married and work and love and live like other people do? - Because we spend more than other people. - Because my father stopped paying my bills. Your bills. All right. Let's face the next. - I won't face collada. A frightened bureaucrat? I've seen him lose control. He's vicious. He's got fina. He must know about the plates by now. He'll kill me. - Not if you offer to put them into his hands. We can still bring this off, and we're going to. - Tell me, what has my father to do with this? - What has your father to do with this? - Tell me. - Nothing or everything. - Maybe now I would like to live like your father, eh? All my life, the best years, spent in harness like a workhorse. Trusted? Oh, certainly. Dependable. "Can you stay a weekend, collada?" "Oh, si. Si, senor. "I can spare my weekend, my brains, my life. A pleasure, senor." Senor collada has gone into business for himself. - And senor Sherwood has been protecting me from your questions, hasn't he? - Protecting you, senorita Josefina? - Yes. He got the counterfeit from me. - And you from? - Rubi. - Rubi. Yes, yes. The little rich boy who grew up poor and whose lives grow more incredible every day. I should have known. Well, where are the plates? - The plates? - Precisely. - In his apartment. - Oh, no, no, no. Not there. I am painfully aware of every elegant inch of that apartment. Try harder, senorita, for your friend's protective powers are at a low ebb. - I was lying. But I know where rubi hid them. I will take you there, if you will promise to let senor Sherwood go. - Take me where? - To El morro. You cannot find them without me. And I won't go without your promise. - Fina. - If we make the trip to El morro now and find nothing but rock and history-- - the plates are there. - We will go. I can't let your friend go, but we will let him rest. Rest here, to help US refresh your memory if we should return empty-handed. - Don't go with him. - Carmen. - Who is it? - Rubi. Carlos rubi. - He's not here. - I know he is. - He's not. Go now before I call the police. - Let me past. Miguel? Miguel collada? I have something to tell you. Miguel? Miguel collada? There is something I have to tell you. - Polizia, pronto. ♪Pronto. Colonel mastegui. Sherwood. Sherwood, ned Sherwood calling. You can blame collada for that, unless you want to put the credit somewhere else. - I'm ill. - Ill or dying, you're gonna help me find fina. - Give me time. I'll do what you want later. - Not later. Right now, she's somewhere on morro with that crazy partner in crime of yours. - El morro. - He forced her to guess where rubi hid those plates. For me, she tried. - El morro. Yes. Why not? Our old hiding place. - Find him, please. Tell the colonel to meet US at El morro fast. - A trip to morro castle, senor? The fortress that defended Havana from 1589 until the English pirates came over. - Senor. Visit morro castle, senor? You will see the battlements, the shark's nest... - Let's get going. - But senor, it is too early. My boat holds 20. Oh, vamanos. Come on, no? - Where prisoners were chained to the same iron rings and sat out their sentence. Behind you are openings originally used by the Spanish to slide the Cuban patriots in the sea below. The sharks got their bodies. No one ever learned what happened to their loved ones. - Are there still sharks down there? - Senora, some of these same sharks are still hopefully waiting just below. Please follow me. - Will we see the execution chamber? - Senora, we'll see everything. - I wish I'd worn low heels. - Two plates are here. Six are not. Think hard and again, senorita. - Come. - Could it be that having found what you have, you choose to find no more? - There is one more place. - Some of the methods of killing prisoners in colonial days was with the garroting. The man of the back of the prisoner also got three years off his sentence with each execution. - This is where she would have taken him. - Looks like she did. Anywhere else? - All he had to do was to twist the handle. A simple twist will break the man's spine. Please follow me. The last garroting was held in Cuba in 1932. Cannon was firing through the walls in 1940. - Anita. How do we reach them? If you lead me wrong once more, I haven't got a drop of charity left. You know that, don't you? - Mislead you why? Carlos is dead, and in a way, so am I. - Vamanos. - No, let me try. Miguel! Miguel! Carlos has lost his life on our gamble. Why should we? It's all over. Give me your gun. - Anita! - I won't! - Ah! - No. Don't. It's better like this. But this time, you can't get me out of it. - Collada. - Collada? - Into the sea with the plates. - The plates we'll get back from the sharks. During the big trouble in Cuba, Armando ferrer gave a son to his country, a wonderful boy. And now he gives a daughter. It is clear it happened like this. She learned it was collada, came here, a true daughter of ferrer, to try to stop him. Yes, a hard blow for Armando ferrer. - It's your father who needs help now. - Will you go with me? - Anywhere.
