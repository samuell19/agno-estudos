Nowadays it's almost the same thing. but the cost of living at this time and age, it dissolves it all. So, we just about doing about as good as we did in '45. lt was good enough for me to put five kids through high school and college too. Course it was tough, but l made it. Right, l had 17 of 'em. You talk about sing, ing on the railroad it's just like a band on a football field. That band gives the team spirit to play and that singing gives you pep to work. All right, now. Up under the railing up under the tie Up under the rail where the tie lie Up under the rail where the tie lie Up under the rail up under the tie Up under the rail where the tie lie A lot of mens have got hurt handling steel. Steel is very dangerous. of handling that steel with a big bunch of men they'd always be putting out money on hospital bills and injuries. And they had to have some system to protect that, you know, prevent it from happening all the time. And at its best, we have accidents with it. When you come to work on Monday morning at seven o'clock and get out there on the job working, singing comes according to what job you're doing. Now you take lining track. That singing was just a rhythm that the labor used in keeping the time and getting the track lined like the boss man wanted. But now, singing -wasn't no joy in it whatsoever. To get the job done. What the old lady say when she come to die She put a hand on her hip and one on her thigh Good Lord, have mercy All right, quarter back. All right, all right Just a little bit, Just a hair Just a little bit right there Just a little bit just a hair Just a little bit right there Alrighty, Jack the Rabbit, Jack the Bear Just a little bit right there Give it to me in the center.

Oh, everybody near about.. You couldn't hear your ears. And some of them could sing so good, 'till the mules would go to hollering. They'd just holler-just holler, like it was twelve o'clock or something. l'd get out there and got my team, then. Get way back on the end of my line, you know. Two great big old mules, trace straps all on them. Their heads up in the air like that with them harnesses on them. Wearing tassels hanging all down the side of them. Just taking my time, just walking and walking. l'm gonna be late in the morning, l'm gonna be late all day, Hey, hey, hey, hey l'm gonna be late all day With old Freddie Mae Them big son of a guns just stepping, just stepping with me. They pulling me up the levee! l'm just raring back on the lines. People that's been here a few years, l guess that's why God didn't kill 'em all. He left somebody here to tell the story. lt be so cold out there they wouldn't let you go to the fire. You'd have to let your lines slip through your hands. l don't understand. Tell me how that was. Like your wheeler'd be going along - you have two mules to it, and the mules be going along you'd walk along and get up to the fire and... What was the fire doing there? They'd had a fire built for you to warm going by, you couldn't stop at it, your wheeler couldn't stop, but you could let the mules keep a-going and let the lines slide through your hands till you get to the end, then you got to catch 'em. You couldn't never just say, ''stop'' at the fire and warm. What would they do to you? Cut your head! Beat it with a pistol, stick or something. They'd ride right in the middle of the pit and old man Brown used to take his hat off his head. He wore a big white Stetson, a great big one, and he'd throw it up and he'd shoot six holes in it before it hit the ground. Then he'd tell somebody down there and they would hand it to him. And he'd say, ''Now listen, l'm gonna whip you if you stand and l'm gonna kill you if you rU n. l want ya'll to do so and so and so. l want you to get me some dirt. l got to finish such and such a station by such and such a time... And is there any questions?'' When he asked you that, he'd have his hand on that pistol. Kill a nigger, hire another one Kill a mule, buy another one. Plenty of mornings you had to wait until it get light enough to go to work. You be standing there in the dark. Then when it get light enough, then you go to work. Then you'd work in the evening, 'til you couldn't see how to come in. You wasn't locked up, but other than that it was just like the penitentiary. They paid you what they wanted. They gave you what they wanted you to have. lf you didn't do it, somebody's going to beat you up. Why did you men go into those places? We didn't know no better. You couldn't do no better. You was trying to leave the farm for 50 and 75c a day and go someplace where you could earn a little bit more money. But when you get in those places, you would earn the money but you didn't get paid for it. Yeah, you get out there and they'd say they were going to,give you $15 a week And payday, he may pay you off and then he may not pay you off. He just work you out there sometimes 2 and 3 months just give you a drag, like 1 O or $15, something to gamble around in the camp with. Mister Charlie gave 'em payday boys, lnstead he give a drag. Wasn't no difference in the money that the two men had.

No matter how much money you got, That can't buy it with God. God said -you are just a steward And He lended it to you for a few days. l remember one Friday morning, Out there on Calvary, They tell me that they hung the S- O-N on the cross. Tell me that the S-U-N peeped up and looked at the S-O-N And say that the S-U-N told the S- O-N ''Two suns can shine together.'' And the reason that the sun amen The reason that the sun don't blind His eyes is because He is the sun's creator tonight. Look at my big old God tonight That step out that morning and spoke a blooming universe into existence. God didn't need no hammer or no nail God didn't need no pliers or no screwdriver God didn't need no cement mixer to pour the foundation All my God said is, ''Let there be...'' When God come back He gonna to throw away the straw of pity He gonna take away the leaves of compassion He gonna to take away, l say, the feathers of his mercy Ain't gonna be nothing left in the nest But the briars of indignation Ain't nothing gonna be left in the nest But the sharp stick of His mighty wrath Let me close here, brethren l say, God will stir you up tonight. l say He'll stir you up.

Amen. If it were good enough for them it is good enough for me. lt brought 'em a long ways. It brought 'em a long ways. December the seven, forty-one That's when the Second World War had just begun. They tell me Mussolini was holding out his paw And trying to get the European countries under Hitler's law. First have a little patience l'm gonna tell it to you The first thing they done, they got rid of the Jews But Great Britain got trouble in mind She rushed the poor boys to the firing line Better than that, the Germans bombed beautiful Paris late one night They had to look to America for to get supplies They loaded up the vessel and started across But the news reached back that the vessel was lost. Mr. Roosevelt didn't say that, he say ''l just can't see Why Adolph Hitler trying to rule the sea.'' He sent him a message right straight from the phone say, ''Looka here Hitler, leave my vessel alone.'' But ole Tojo looked back in the States Him and Mussolini could not communicate Old Japan went a hushing by she wouldn't fight on either side. l don't know, but l was told That's the way Pearl Harbor base got stole. Well here's where we came in at. Negro soldiers standing at attention They were the poor boys in every dimension But l'm gonna to tell you about a colored man December the seven, forty-one That's when the Yanks started mighty manning the gun He stepped on deck and he got dead aim He brought a Japanese bomber down in flames Some got wounded, some got killed But naturally we know God's Holy Bible got to fulfill. l found out later there was a ration on rubber, so was gasoline That's where l was, so help me God. Well, back in the jungle it woods deep The bad lion stepped on the signifying monkey's feet. That monkey say, ''Look lion, can't you see? Why you standing yourself on my God-durn feet?'' So, the lion said, ''l don't hear a God-dern word you said, But you say two more and l'll be stepping on your God-dern head.'' Well, everyday before the sun go down The lion would kick his butt all through the jungle town. But the monkey got wise and started using a little of his wit He say l'm gonna to put a stop to this old rot-kicking stuff. So the lion jumped up in a bad rage Like a young gangsta, full of gauge He lit out with a roar, his tail shot back like a 44. He went off through the jungle, knocking down trees. Kicking giraffes til they fell down to their knees. So, he ran up on the elephant talking to the square, Said, ''Alright you big bad joker, gon be yours or mine.'' Said, ''Go ahead on you little funny bunny mother and pick on somebody your own size.'' So the lion jumped up and made a fancy pass The elephant side-stepped and kicked him dead in the grass. lt messed up his neck, messed up his face. Broke all four legs, snatched his you-know-what out of place. He picked him up and slammed him through the trees Nothing but that stuff as far as you could see. So he drug his butt back to the jungle more dead than alive. Just to run into that monkey with some more of his signifying jive.
