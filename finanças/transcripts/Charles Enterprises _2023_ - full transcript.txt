Sorry, brother. 'Hello! Hey!' Haa! Hi! Where are you going? Can't you see me? Sorry, brother. I didn't notice you. When will this work be over? God knows! Why? Do you get something when the work's done? - For a shop... - To buy a shop? This is a great spot. - Not buy, but to rent... - Oh, for renting... Do you have their number? Yes, I've saved it. Do you have my number? - 99... - One minute. 99... 47... - 47... - 224... - 224... - 008. 8. I'm giving a missed call. - Many are coming to check the building. - Oh. Hello! Sir! Okay, brother. Yes, I gave. Yes, Sir. I'll come. 'Cobra, SI Madavanthra answering...' 'A pickpocketing case was registered 2 days ago on 'Kunthimol' bus near South bridge.' 'A suspect has been taken into custody.' 'The complainant has been called to the station to identify the suspect.' 'The suspect is a Tamil guy from Dhendithuruthy colony.' 'Control room answering.' Sir! No helmet and no relevant papers. Write a petty case and send them away. Don't waste time. They are saying they won't pay the fine. They are saying something about Christ whipping the money collectors. - Then send them after paying the fine. - Write it down, Sir. Praise the Lord! God! Save us from this! Slowly! Son, swing slowly. - Okay, then. Leave - Yes, Sir. Sir, Greetings! I'm Ravi Kumaraswamy. - I was asked to come. - Mallu Sir is inside. Go in. Sir, SI Sir? That room. Sir is there. - Excuse me, Sir? - 'Yes?' Greetings, Sir. I'm Ravi. I lost my purse. - I was asked to come. - Sit down. - Bring that Tamilian. - Yes, Sir. We nabbed the guy this morning. Identify him. That's it. I will try. - Move here! - Go there! Have you seen him? Erm... Sir, that... I have not seen... Why the heck are you laughing, prick? Oh no! Sir! Slowly... Slowly, dear. At Pandaraparambil Joseph's house, a break-in happened at 2 yesterday. There were two guys. I met Sir. What should I do now? Sit there. There are some formalities. Do you know when I can leave? This is a police station. Why are you in such a hurry to leave? Sir, please don't beat him. Didn't your purse get robbed? Then why do you bother? I don't have any complaints. - Let him go, Sir. - Is this child's play to change your mind? - Get out! - Go outside! - Go out! - Beat him! An innocent soul! Duh! Thanks, brother. 'Sir, the Magistrate is in the chamber.' Write accordingly. Madam... Please, Madam. Can I leave? - Ouch! - I can't see properly once it gets dark. What are you staring at? Move! What did you say? That, once it gets dark... my eyes won't work if there is no light. I will talk with Sir and let you know. Sir, what's that Tamilian's name? Charles! Got such a royal name and all... But lives in that Dhendithuruthy colony! 'Charles Enterprises' 'This wait to catch the thief is a brilliant setup.' 'Will there be any point sacrificing our sleep?' 'I won't be joining hereafter. Going to observe the fast for Sabarimala.' '- It's not crowded these days.' - What's going on here? Go to your houses! '- Hey! Who's that? - Those are guys who go to work daily.' You pests! "Rain and thunder are one family" "One family" This damn Google Meet thing won't work. Google? Will there be thunder? This isn't the month for the rain. Then what thunder! Thunder doesn't need specific months these days. Hey! If you get drunk, 'Odambal' and 'Superman' Jose will escape. Hey! There! Who is it? Huh? 'The diets to follow while using a mace.' 'If one can be sexually active,' If you go through Gomathi's house, it's like going through a drama troupe's office. Her house is filled with weapons of various Gods. Haa! So, you have watched plays? How will I? Nobody here encourages me! Ask politely. Maybe that kid will agree. That's why I asked you to come before he leaves for work. Will this work? How many houses did she show us? Did anything work? How many houses did I show? But your cameraman wasn't satisfied. I'm no cameraman, Madam. I'm the art director. Whatever! Come. Stop thinking and walk, Khasi. What to think! Are we going to that house now? Think so. Oh! What the heck is this?! Are you sitting here? Did you sweep the house? - Let me post this, Mom. - Don't sweep. Keep clicking on that phone! - Ravikuttan, it's me, Vilasini auntie. - Yes, I know. - Tell the matter, kids. - Bro, I'm Christie. This is Khasi. This is art director Kannan Anchumala. We came searching for a location for a web series. Then, she said your house will be the apt location. Shall we come in and check? Can you help them around? I must run to the shop and I'm late for work. Mom, come down! Vilasini auntie is here! Get in! This is the room. Note down all these. Aha! Were you here, Gomathi?! - Hail Lord Sri Rama... - These are people from the cinema. They need a house from the ancient times for shooting. It's only a one-day shoot. A bunch of kids, they are. You can make some money as well. - Sister, move aside. - Hail Lord Sri Rama... - This is great! - Hail Lord Sri Rama... - This looks fantastic! - Hail Lord Sri Rama... Jewellery box! But this is empty. Hail Lord Sri Rama! Hail Lord Sri Rama! Hail Lord Hanuman! Hail Lord Hanuman! Hail Lord Sri Rama... - You got another great room too? - Hail Lord Sri Rama... Hail Lord Hanuman! Hey! You! 'This will work for us. It's from the ancient times.' 'Ouch! Good god!' Walk! Damn! You come with me, Mr. art director. It might not be as tatty or old as this, but I, too, have a similar kind of house. Come. - Did you have to go through these? - Now blame me! Where's this lady taking us to? This is nobody else, Sir, but 'Odambal' Hamsa. I'm sure. 'Odambal' is out on parole. Is he? I didn't know. Or 'Superman' Jose. - Nobody else, for sure. - Yes. - Yes, it could be 'Superman' Jose as well. - Come. Mohanan! Seems like we got too many cops in the morning. Did they catch the 'Black man'? I don't know if it's Black or White. A thief broke into the colonel's house in 12B. - Get me these things. - Sure, I will. - Ravi... - Hey! How are things? What colonel for a thief?! Heard that our courageous colonel was shaken like a leaf! Even we had some thuds and bangs on our side as well. If he breaks into our house, - Uncle will beat him to a pulp. - Of course! Mohanan, one banana. Ravi, we are off. Now we will have to join the gym. Why does our Ravikuttan need to go to a gym? Our Ravikuttan is all good even now. Make it fast, yaar. I've been asking Mohanan to join the gym for a while. - Don't you have a blue cover? - No, blue. Take this and leave. - Balance? - Will give it tomorrow. - You've to give me. - Yeah, I will. Due to the corona, the yield was low, Gomathi. - Corona for who? Coconuts? - Eh? Who got the corona? The coconuts? You are very attentive about everything but the accounts. Son, dear... Please turn the car on before you leave. Its battery has gone down. Someone should come and check it out. Keep this in properly. I'm leaving. Bye. - DID YOU BUY A CAR? - Ouch! Speak slowly. I can hear clearly. 'Kanakaraj, Chartered Accountant and Associates' Parvatham Sundareshan! For Ma'am, 'Pillaiyaar' is everything! Even 'Pillaiyaar' knows Ma'am very well. She has this habit. Anything she likes, wherever it is, she will come in person like this, and will ask for it politely. Even you won't be able to say no. Because Parvatham, is a wonder! 'Pillaiyaar'? Who are you? Huh? I am Mr Saravanan. You can call me Saravanan Sir. No problem. Tell me why did you come. The thing is... - Bhanu... - 'Yes!' 'Why did you call me?' Deity! - Where is it from? - This is theirs. Where did they get this? They came to buy this. Aha! Great! I won't let Gomathi sell this until my last breath! Do you know what mishaps are happening at the ancestral house? Temples and rituals are senseless acts for her! When the family temple was ruined by lightning, she grabbed our deity from us by cajoling our father. - Ma'am... - What, Ma'am? Whose Ma'am? Shut up, you Tamil guy! His white pants and shirt! Pfft! We need to shift it from there quickly. They left, Bhanu. Or else people like this will keep going there. You keep loitering around! Duh! Things are going a different way. Before the kith and kin join hands, Shall we finish them? Go and find that lad! Find the lad? Doctor, when I think of married life... unable to see during the night... Doesn't the saying go, 'love is blind'? - Isn't the touch everything? - Yes. Okay. Dear Ravi... It's better to not see and hear things after marriage. You ended up with this problem because your parents were blood relatives. Don't be anxious. There is no chance for this to happen to your kids. Stay strong. That was my Grandpa's idea to not risk the family fortune and status! Marrying his daughter to an uncle's son from Palani. They parted ways after some time. And I ended up with this issue. Isn't a good thing going to happen in your family? Try to bring them together. My dear doctor... That's a battle between faith and the arts. Adding to that is a huge ego! Tell me something that can actually happen. I've kept something for you. A medical representative brought this. - What is this? - Check it out. This is different from the last time. This is great, doctor! So, scientists are doing things for people like us too. Hey! She has been asking for you. Eh? Why? Anyway, you go in. Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! - Hey! Good morning! - Ha! Good morning! If this goes on, we will all lose our jobs. Try to get rid of her some way or the other. Jimshar bro, can't you stick to your life? Isn't she doing her job? Poke your nose into my life now! - Hey! - Yes? You... tempered the buttermilk curry with red chillies, right? So? Why are you acting so coy? Nothing. Don't leave. Hai, good morning! - Morning! - Bro, your work is the best. If you play with those strings for one hour in the morning, you get 2000 rupees! - Here! - Then you come and play the strings! Simply provoked him! Ravi Kumaraswamy? - Hi, Ravi! - Hi! I'm Mr Saravanan. Madam wants to meet you. Madam? Which Madam? Can we talk in private? Hey, come here. - I'll come in a bit. - Okay. I'll be right back. Brother... We've been drying in the sun for a while now. Tell me the matter. I've to return to the shop. Look there Ravi... how long are you going to collect money and drop it in the cash drawer? I'm going to drop it in your account now. Fine. You have a Pillaiyaar statue at your home, right? - Statue? - Yes, bro. Pillaiyaar. - Pillaiyaar means? - Pillaiyaar means Ganesha. Haa! We have a Ganapati. I want that. What do you want? What are you guys saying? I don't understand. What's it about? Son, for many generations, Pillaiyaar is our everything. Pillaiyaar, for me, is my life. Please give the Pillaiyaar in your home to me. What to give? By the way, how do you know about the idol in my house? We don't know. But Archaeology Department knows. There's something called Archaeology Department. Do you know that? That I know. But if I go home saying this, my Mom will kick me out. Bro, please drop me back. I'm late. Gotta go... Hey, brother... Did you keep your brains somewhere and come? We need that statue. What do you need? He and his damn statue! Hey! He will come... Pass it here. Here! Here! Pass it So, let's then... Let's start now. I have a strong belief in astrology. We left the house after 'rahu', the inauspicious time. But there was some time left for 'gulika'. So, can't start auspicious acts. Astrologer Raman did mention. He also noted down some good dates in the month of 'Makaram'. 'Makaram' means? After 14th of January. That's good. We have got time. When we visited the house last time, you had a bee hive. - Is it still there? - Yes, it is. If I were in my prime, I would've removed it myself. We will see if we can get some migrant labourers. Who else can do that? This visually impaired him? - Sanitizer? - No, thanks. Sangeetha... I can call you Sanghi, right? Sanghi won't be a good choice. Sanghi... Can't Ravi see anything during the night? It's not like that. I can see if there's some light. Why? You guys pose. Let me take a photo. Stand a little closer. Smile. If you did a clean shave, you would've looked cuter, Ravi. This beard is my confidence. If the beard goes, that goes as well. I'll take one more. Can you send me this photo? Sure! - Okay, then. - Thank you. Don't post this on Instagram now. What's the issue with my beard? It's classy. Did you need to talk about that, then? I only told the truth. Didn't this alliance come after knowing our kid's illness? Isn't it so? What's it? Nothing. Invite who all needed to be invited for the wedding. No need for any special invite now. Everyone's coming here, saying some temple affairs or something. What temple affair? Renovating the temple and enshrining of the deity. Something like that... The idol was here all this time. There has been no issue so far. What's this new devotion? It's no devotion. There are some other plans. Before that girl comes here, try to remove them from here. They are innocent creatures. They are the guards of my Ganapati. Let them stay there. I'm leaving. I'll be able to catch the bus to Palakkad. Ravikuttan, I'm off. Keep two drumsticks too. It's for my husband, Sailesh... Which ticket amongst this will win the lottery? Any idea? If I knew that, would I sell it to you? - Give him something that'll win. - I know it won't win. Sure. Let's see. Hello, Dad! Eh? What happened? Hold this. No issues. I'm coming. - Did you see this? - Aren't those numbers that won? Dad, what happened? This happens often. Seems like B.P. went down. Thought of getting it checked. I can't sleep at night. Did you come alone? Where are your buddies? So, how's your mother? Nothing new. Same as before. But her devotion has gone up these days. Has introduced some 'lucky mace' and things like that. Playing with them and getting back sprains is her current hobby. She is a treasure-guarding genie. You guys shouldn't have separated. How did your bride-seeing go? Saw the girl... Do you have a photo? Show me. Nice girl. Suits you well. The girl is good. I wonder if she liked me. I think my eye problem is a problem for her. Token number 5. My number is 11. Don't waste your time sitting here. Leave for your work. No issues. I can wait. Go, dear. I'll manage this. Dad, be careful while going back home. Call me if there's anything. Do you know how things are going around here? Neither can you come on time, and wanna leave early as well. You know about the sales, right? Management has decided to cut down the staff. If this is how it is, I'll have to make a serious decision. There will be no point complaining later. Sorry. I'll... Hmm. Go. Thank you. Hello, Kuttu... Hey! What was that about? Shall we order a hit on that schmuck? Get lost! Haa, scorn! Rich chocolate 1kg. 990 rupees. Madam, do you need a copy? No, thanks. - Did we get any orders on Swiggy? - No. - Give that money. - Eh? Give that money. - How much? - 100 rupees. Isn't that 100? Who was that lady who came to the shop today? That was Parvatham. Parvatham?! What kind of name is that? That's her name. That Kannada actor who passed away recently, Puneet Rajkumar. His mother's name is also Parvatham. How do you know that? I Googled the name after she came. Learnt it so. As the wedding is nearing, seem to be coming. Tell me the truth, Ravi. Are you some R.A.W. agent? People who can't see during the night are made R.A.W. agents, pfft! Have you seen any R.A.W. agents before? How will I see? Hey, hey! What was that? - That's smoke. - What's that? Hail Lord Siva! Hail Lord Siva! You don't want to say anything, Gomathi. Only with the enshrining of the idol in the family temple, there will be a solution to all the mishaps. Hail Lord Siva! You can go on chanting for whatever we say! How did the idol in the family temple ended up with me? You took away the land on which the temple stood. What I got was a grove and a pond to which there's no road! Leave that. Not letting the idol rust away there, our father gave me the idol, asking me to light a lamp daily. Dear, Gomathi... Idols should be kept in the temple, not in the house, right? Isn't that so? That's the difference between a temple and a house. Yes. Didn't you order food? - Eh? - Might be Ravikuttan. - No. - Pappan kumar? The house ahead. Last day, while Sasi was leaving the house, a coconut frond fell. Narrow escape! Why?! Ganapati was reminding us! If we need to build the temple, we have only the grove left. So, the profit I'm receiving now will stop. It's okay. Isn't it for my deity?! Let's ask astrologer Raman for a consult. Why do we need astrologer Raman? - We have great astrologers in our town. - Nobody else! Astrologer Raman would do. If it's revealed that the deity wants to be there, I'll bring it myself. Er... water... Wa...ter. Can't you eat slowly? Greedy! Didn't I tell you? Gomathi will only agree to a humble talk. If she disagrees, our plans won't... Hi, auntie! Everyone is here! Is it some conspiracy? No. We came because of Ganapati... Oh, Ganapati called... Seems like the groom-to-be is on the phone full-time. Will you avoid us due to this corona? Good god! How can I marry by avoiding you all? Wipe that puffs pieces from the lips. On the moustache. I'll be outside. Sasi, water. Bhanu... We can do the consult as planned. I will decide on a place. Everyone should come there. My dear Lord Ganesha! See this. This way... This is our junction. Did you understand? Ram will be here. - I'll be here. - And I'll be here. - Check the map. - Okay, then. I'll tell you something, Ram. This time... we will catch him. - Sure. - If not? Tch! Don't say negative things. 'We will come up with a new plan.' 'I've been hearing the same for a while.' 'Dance when we say 'Action'.' Pass the ball 'I...' 'have to say something.' 'The problem with your eyes' 'will cause issues in our future.' 'So, isn't it better that we call the wedding off now?' 'Sorry.' Who is it? 'Who is it?!' Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Bro, can you please move to that side? "Time flew lone and alone" "I'm all alone" "Black clouds looming above to roam around in the dark" "I'm the brave, is the earth my shore?" "Turned into a tusker travelling through times" "The time when the darkness in the forest became my habit" "The rigour when desires in my heart became weapons" "Colours in plenty Numerous blasts" "Desires came to life like bloomed flowers" "Treasures seen, paths were mountains" "Hurdles like leaves, and a new world made out of them" "I roam around all alone, tomorrows of crossed mountains" "I stand on this road asking, who's by my side" "Time flew lone and alone I'm all alone" "Black clouds looming above to roam around in the dark" "Time flew lone and alone I'm all alone" "Black clouds looming above to roam around in the dark" Couldn't you have asked someone to come along? Will this someone always be there? Didn't you listen to the voice message I sent? "Did the world disappear when my eyes were covered with darkness" "The one searching for the tunes got exhausted" "The weight on my shoulders lies in my heart like this" "Magic that flourished and firmed its root in the ground" "I become lightning, curse over a curse" "Her leaving might be the riot within" "Did my life turn into a thirst for money" "When that became my life, my ocean turned dark" "Time flew lone and alone I'm all alone" "Black clouds looming above to roam around in the dark" "Time flew lone and alone I'm all alone" "Black clouds looming above to roam around in the dark" 'Son!' Second last ball. Everyone! Be active! Tuttu, come in front. Oh-no! 'Right on the window glass!' You broke it Isn't that the side window? Nobody will notice. Hey! I saw it! The photo came on WhatsApp yesterday. Stop! We have to install CCTV. Nothing else will work. - Yes. - Krishnettan, why do we need CCTV? Isn't God watching everything from above? Yes. If you are going to install a camera, place one before my house first. Then you should keep two in front of my house too. Is this some free ration?! If it's in good working condition, you only need one, Vilasini. Hey! Did you postpone Ravikuttan's wedding? No, we called it off. Who told this? Seema told me. I didn't believe her, though. Whatever it be, I don't need a camera in front of my house. We will lose our privacy, dear. This is not to install in front of anyone's house. - But to keep it on the road. - Yes. Then, you guys discuss and make a decision. I got some work at home. Gomathi, find some way to remove Vinod's car from there. The corporation has issued a notice. Is that the corporation's job these days? Several other vehicles are parked there as well. Take them away first. Then we will see. 'Seema, stop by the house. I have some notice to give.' This won't work. She's tough. She will fall and break her back. Sure! What is wrong with this lady? She's having a whale of a time! Aren't all these art forms? Let her have a blast. Is this an art form? Fantastic! - Hello! - 'Hello! I'm the watchman from Arakkillam.' How are you? I have saved your number. Tell me. 'I have to say something.' 'A shop has been opened for rent there.' Oh! Can I get back to you in 2-3 days? 'After 2 days...' 'others might take it.' I'll call you back. I'm on some work now. 'Call me for sure.' 'Dad...' What's your take on me opening a coffee shop? Add some more coffee powder. And you are going to open a coffee shop?! We can buy a good coffee machine to make coffee at the shop. Or we can do one thing. We can get that Portuguese landlord of yours. Then we will get classy Portuguese coffee. You will kick me out of here! Due to this issue with eyes, life's completely stuck, Dad. Don't worry thinking about that. Whatever you do, stay happy. Are you really happy with your life, Dad? If you ask whether I'm happy, I miss you guys. But I need to make a film. 'Swami bro!' Who is it? What is it? Check. Oh! No change at all! Changes don't happen to change. - Comrade! - Comrade! Comrade, pfft! - Keep it inside. - Okay. Dad... You should come home the next day or so when you are free. Me? To your house? Drop it! - I can't come there. - Dad... Leave! Why did you bring these? Won't I, do it? I'll press the clothes. You, go and get ready. My dear Mom, only you are left to press! I'll press it myself. Don't say so, Ravikuttan. Ravikuttan! What kind of name did you give me! Couldn't you have given me a stylish name? Does anyone with the name Ravi have become successful? Ravi Vallathol, T.G. Ravi... Vayalar Ravi. Didn't they all become a success? You will also succeed like them. But if I had a much more classy name, it would've been easy to succeed. These days, my son is feeling like seeing Dad occasionally, isn't it? Do you have any issues with that photo being there? I have no issues. Your room, your table, your Dad! Go ahead and worship! Like this, he should also feel like seeing us. Even you can feel the same, Mom. I don't want to feel so, plumpy! Ravikuttan... What's it, Mom? Oh! Was it you, Dad? - Mom, come here. - Why? - Why did you get so flustered? - Why should I fluster? Your Dad came to meet you. Why should I bother? He can come to the shop if he wants to meet me. Come here. Come. I've to go to Usha's son's feeding ceremony and prayer. Of course! Feeding ceremony, prayer, offering, duh! Then what's the point of me coming? My son and I have got only God! Mom... Please come and sit here. Dad came because I asked him to. I've to discuss something with you. The thing is, my job at the shop... is on the verge of losing. I feel like starting something new, Mom. I've noted a shop. To start, I need something from you... To start by yourself? Don't we need too much money for that? Er... then ask him. Didn't you see my state? Very much aware of own condition! But no idea about what others' states are! Mom, please calm down. If you both sign, I can arrange some money pledging the house. I have no issues. But I have. This is your only shelter. Don't risk that. Let this cinema affair work. Pfft! Cinema! The cinema which hasn't worked so far will work now! I know where things are heading. Don't be sad, dear. - Our Ganeshan will be with us. - Ganeshan? Which Ganeshan? How many Ganeshans do you know? I meant our Lord Ganesha. This laugh is the main problem... What is it, Hema? You look like a bride, all dressed up! Oh, your husband is here! That's why, right? Can you lend me some buttermilk? Pappan feels like having buttermilk curry. Oh-no! We don't have buttermilk for the last 2 days. No idea why! It's not curdling. But doesn't Ravikuttan like buttermilk curry? Ravikuttan hates buttermilk these days. Ask Sarala. No wonder you parted ways! What a waste! There's no milk. I'm making black coffee. - Where is he? - Dad left. What happened? Your face looks so glum. Is it because the wedding got cancelled? Stop it, yaar. Only after it was cancelled I realised it's not the biggest issue in life. Then, what's your issue? How long can I go billing for others? Did you notice that couple running the momos shop? Did you see the Volkswagen car parked beside? - Yes, I did. - That belongs to them. They used to work at Kakkanad Infopark before corona. - Them? - Yes, them. Ravi, this is what life is. Are you asking me to start momos business like them? I didn't say anything. Leave it. I got some plans in my mind. Let's have tea. Didn't we come this far? You enjoy your tea and leave slowly. I have to get back to the hostel. - Okay then, bye. - Okay. Thank you, Murali. Hi! Why are you stalking me? I didn't come to argue with you, Ravi. In fact, I'm trying to help you. Open your eyes and see. - Life is beautiful! - Can't you understand what I said? Didn't I tell you that day? This won't happen. This won't happen. Please, leave me alone. One coffee! Your Pillaiyaar wishes to do some good for you. Try to understand that. Either it will go to the Government, or it will return to the temple. I have already started the works for that. Anyway, you don't need that idol. But you dream of starting a coffee shop. Don't you wish to see this world during night? There is no treatment in India. But abroad, there is. Don't you need money for that? Don't you need a huge amount of money? That's why. I'm saying that I will give. Your Ganeshan is saying he is ready to give. 50 lakhs! Single chance! Are you going to miss it? Or are you going to use it? I see no serious issue with the idol being at Gomathi's house. - But I see a change of seat from there... - Exactly! It... should be shifted to the temple immediately. For prosperity and peace in the family, enshrinement is needed. That's the right thing. Isn't this the same thing Bhanu was repeatedly saying? Lakshmi, don't force me to talk! I told it already. The idol in the temple didn't come walking into my house! I guarded my Lord, whom everyone neglected, like a genie guarding the treasure. Now, whatever my Lord wants, I won't stand against it. If anyone wants to ask anything, ask. What happened, Mom? You look different on coming back. You look so emotional. What happened? Finally, a decision has been made on our Ganeshan. From now on, we will have to go to Kollengode to see him. What's this new act? You left after locking the door. This is not ours anymore. We have to give this to others. Shouldn't we be careful? 'Your Pillaiyaar wishes to do some good for you.' Do you need tea, dear? 'O, my Ganesha! Look after me!' Ah! When Ganeshan became not ours, you are starting to have love and faith! That's how things are, always. Go on, pray. Go on, pray! Pray hard. After switching the lights off, close the door and go to bed. O, my Lord Ganesha! Don't bring any obstacles in my son's life! Whatever his path is, be with him and guide him right, my Lord! Mom! Go to bed. Don't stay awake after taking the medicines. Seems like it's going to rain. - Shall I close the door. - Yes, please. O, my Vigneshwara! Ganesha! Protect me! "Pillaiyaar... Pillaiyaar... The eminent deity, Pillaiyaar" "Pillaiyaar... Pillaiyaar... The eminent deity, Pillaiyaar" "Elder to Muruga, who bestowed wisdom to His father, Lord Siva" "The Lord of Supreme Mercy, who never gives upon His devotees" "The Mightiest One, Resting under the shade of the Peepal" "Pillaiyaar... Pillaiyaar... Pillaiyaar... Pillaiyaar..." "O God, grant me permission, So that I can sell you" 'Intermission' - There were loud thunders. I heard nothing. - Me neither. Is it done this fast? Rather than flirting with this monitor, - come and do your job. - Darling, will call you in a minute. Turn that to the left side slightly. - Enough? - Slightly to the right. Haa! The car can be seen on the camera. - A little more... - It's towards this side... Nah, towards that side. Will the camera catch sounds? A bit more. Fix it there. Now don't move it. Fix it there. The doors of the LKG colony aren't strong anymore, Madhavanunni Swami. She might have slept like a log, Ram Swami. Huh! Do you think it's hard for thieves to break locks?! Nothing to worry. I'm tightening it. That's enough. Haa! Uncle is here! Please wait. - Hey, what happened? - I don't know, Uncle. I was upstairs. Both are Tamils. Seeing her, one could easily guess that she's crooked. They said they were hard-core Ganapati devotees... - Take a seat. - They were hard-core Ganapati devotees. One guy's name is Saravanan. The name of the woman that came with him... is something unique like yours, Sir. Parvatham. Parvatham? - Are there such names? - Sir, I... sent her away, giving a mouthful. Then, why didn't you tell me this? Who is this? My brother. Did the Archaeological Department numbered the item? No, they didn't give a number. A photo of the Ganesha idol came on Ravikuttan's Facebook page. They came to enquire after seeing it. They went back on realising it was family property. Deity's picture on Facebook? Did he find anything else to post?! No wonder his wedding was called off! As if Ganapati has no other job than stalking on Facebook! We had no idea that the Archaeological Department had come here. For the last couple of days, I've been dreaming of someone stealing our Ganapati. When? Can you see the person who stole it in your dream? Anyway, let us do an investigation. - Okay, Sir. - Okay. WhatsApp me the picture of the idol. Okay, Sir. Don't worry. Let's catch the guy. You hardly come out these days, do you, Sailesh? Haa! They've come out. Sir! Hail lord Ayyappa! The item is said to be from the days of the British. So, I'm finding it hard to understand. Have you seen anything from the British days? We were not here during the British era, right? The woman who came here, umm... Parvatham... Let us enquire about her. We, the family members, were planning to do a new enshrinement. Seems like your family members are on good terms! - What did sir say? - They will enquire. Where in Palakkad is your family temple? Kollengode. Our father was an employee at HMT. If you receive any information, inform the station. We will try what we can. Isn't that guy the one who came to our station about that pickpocketing case? Yes, it's him, Sir. He can't see at night and that lady's hearing powers are minimal. This is some ruse within the family. Let's not interfere in this case, Sir. The deity will come back on its own. 'Ravi...' Come, son... Here... The antics of my siblings! I am still wondering... who might have taken it from here? Do you feel suspicious about anyone? Not anyone in particular. I think the deity is not interested to stay in that family temple. There's something. Nothing will happen here without my Lord's knowledge. I'm sure of that. Those pretentious acts from each of them! Duh! Auntie... Did the issue for which the cops came resolved? Cop? - Police. - Oh, police... They came to measure the property. Will survey and give the certificate tomorrow. - Come then, okay? - Tomorrow? - Where are you off to? - To eat something... Haa, nice. Have something. Will he be our Ganapati robber? Mom, can you get me some water? I will bring it now. Haa... Mom... Oh... was it you?! - I've been calling you for so long. - I was trying to start the vehicle. This early in the morning? Wasn't you who always asked me to start the vehicle once in a while? You scold me whenever I ask you to start the vehicle once a week. I'm going to Usha's for the prayers. Lock the house and drop the key there before you leave for work. There was something else... Er... son... Son... - What's it, Mom? - Give me the car keys. Erm... I'll keep it inside. No, that won't work. You will forget. The situation is already worse. Thieves are roaming around. And you want to leave the car unlocked! Have something before you leave. "Life's a game of dice" "And we all tokens in the game" "In that first dice falls twelve" "Only to fall zeros later" "All of us, streets" "In solitude" "All of us, silly tokens" "In this illusion" "Luck finds us in the first dice" "Only to vagabond later and later" Ravi, how many times did I tell you... This is no common night blindness, but retinitis pigmentosa. There is no special treatment for this anywhere. It's good that the deity got stolen. Your mother doesn't have to play watchdog anymore. Gomathi... "Some always fall into traps" "Due to their fates" "Selfless ones" "They are the Ganapatis of the streets" "All around the town and land" "As worthless ones" "Wanderers" "They have no hopes or haps" "Life's a game of dice" "And we all tokens in the game" "Luck finds us in the first dice" "Only to vagabond later and later" Who are you? Sister...where in here is Parvatham's office? They stopped everything and left long back! Brother... Get in, brother... LKG colony. Thank you. See you, brother. Hey! Wait. I'll come. Hey, fool! Mother hasn't slept yet. Okay. - Oh no! - What? If we do things that are supposed to do after marriage now... What will we do after marriage? We can love. I love you. - 'Smitha...' - My mother, man. Love you. Haven't you slept? - 'Smitha...' - Coming... - Love you. - Leave me... - Get lost... - 'Smitha...' Brother... where is Charles' house? - Ask in that street. - Okay, brother. Santhosh, after covid, the business has got back on track only now. Give me one month. - One month? - Yes. This is enough! - Hey! What are you doing? - Stop your grinding. Hey, Santhosh... what's the problem? Why are you switching the machine off? If it's off, the batter won't come. If the batter doesn't come, then money will also not come. If money doesn't come, your interest won't come. Understood? Give us three months. - Three? What three months? - Yes. - Hey!! - Didn't I ask you to stop? Slap! Is it hurting? Now did you get that you, too, are a human? We are also humans. You gave us money when we were in trouble. We are still in trouble... If you come and give us more trouble, shouldn't you understand our troubles? Did you get it now? Great! Give us six months. - Carry on with your work, Dad. - Yes, son. That batter has been wasted. Change that batter, Dad. Hey! Brother! Come. Why this way? - Eh? - I have to tell you something. What's it, brother? Any problem? Problem... Can we move there and talk? Come. Hey Charles! Good god! Thought one headache is gone, and there comes another! Fine. What will I gain from this? A share or a commission? It's nothing, brother... Things are not like before. Can't trust people. It's social distancing everywhere. I'll give you a share or commission or whatever you want. I want this business to happen. Brother, that day you saw me as a human being and not as a thief. I will do anything for you. Where's the item? The item isn't the issue. I'm unable to reach the lady, who approached me to buy the item. We have to sell this somehow. We need to get a good buyer. - Hey, bro! Aren't you coming? - Hey! You go. I'll come. - 'Okay.' - There is someone. It is slightly risky. Let's give it a try. First, tell me what the item is. Brother... The item is an idol of Ganapati. - Idol of Ganapati? - Yes. An antique item. Rare piece. What's your offer? Say that. Show me that item of yours first. The deal comes later. Brother, show him. Here. Kuttu Sait... See with all eyes. Brother's friend's great-great-grandfather. He was a mighty warrior. Seeing his fight in the war, the Chola King gifted this rare piece. "Pillaiyaar Misiha!" What's the approximate rate for this item? How much is he expecting for this? Will we get 2 crores? Tell... tell... Hey! If you ask for 2 crores... I can't reach that person on the phone. Without arranging an apt buyer, I cannot put a price on this. So, you guys may leave. Hey, Tamil guy! Don't hang around at your usual troublesome spots with this item. You will end up hurt. That's the power of the item in your hands. Understood? I didn't come to Kochi to make a living. I was born and brought up in Kochi. Understood? What's it, brother? Got scared? Not sacred. But will we get into trouble trying to sell this? Brother, what problem will come when I am with you? No problem will come. If something comes, I'll take care of it. Shall we go? Hi. Good morning, Ma'am. - Did you call me? - Please take your seat. Ravi, hope your mother is fine. She's good. We're shutting down a couple of our outlets. The shift timings may get shuffled. It would be trouble for you, Ravi. I think this is good for you. We'll miss you, man. Thank you, Ma'am. Alright. Hello, Madam. Didn't you come to know? I'm screwed. I'm fired. What will you do now? Mom?! For now, I will not tell my mother until I find another job. I'm not upset because I lost my job. I'll miss you badly. Honourable people, The LKG Mahila Bhajan Seva Sangh is deeply saddened by the unfortunate incident at our Gomathi's house. Om Shanthi! Shanthi! Shanthi hi! Please settle down. You never told us that you had such a rosy idol of Ganesha. You didn't even give us friends a chance to perform bhajan. We are really offended about it. What's the point in feeling offended now? - Thief has already stolen it. - Mom... The Gods are supporting thieves nowadays! What's Ravi's star sign? Makam of the month, Dhanu. As per astrology, this is a good time for people born in Makam star. There will be a gradual progression in terms of career. Vilasini auntie seems to have a good grasp of astrology! I inherited this mastery hereditary. What's your star sign, Gomathi? - Let us take your leave, then. - Okay. Don't be sad, Gomathi. Break 9 coconuts at Madappally Ganapati temple to resolve the issue. Isn't the deity that went missing a Ganapati as well? Okay. 'Will 9 be enough?' 'Bhanu is doing everything to resolve this issue.' 'Astrologers reading inked betel leaves are coming there tomorrow.' Call your grandson. Mrs. Bhanu, today's chickpeas curry was really spicy. Bring your focus on the idol and keep your eyes here. Look into this ink, thinking of Ganapati. Look, son. Could you see anything? Take a good look. Can you see anything there? Yeah. What did you see? Tell me. Little Ganesha is getting into a car. It seems Ganesha is travelling in a car now! Whose car?! The essence is that the kid saw Lord Ganesha on his vehicle, the mouse. That means... He is currently travelling, Bhanu. Oh! Can you find out who the thieves are? The police will have to find it out. Now... Abandoning material and sexual thoughts observing severe fasting the men of the family should venture out for the idol. Listen... I... I take medicines. I've got a special diet. - Diet?! - Shashi... How can we have children without the blessings of God? Sasi is ready to go through any severe austerity measures if it is to find the idol - Aren't you? - Lachu! Hush... No middle-aged person can take exception from this. Do you know why? If they do, there will be no result. That's how it should be, isn't it Mrs. Bhanu? If you can, please determine a place for consecration as well... I don't accept idols and all. If you have any golden eggs, bring them. Golden eggs?! What the hell, man?! Golden egg! I'll bring. "Come, dear. Come" "If gone, it's gone. If it's wasted, it can't be regained." "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!" Clear off, kiddos. The cops are already getting on my nerves. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!" "Show us the way!" "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!" "You are my steps to victory" "My brother" 'Ravi, why are you turning yourself off?' "What's this, man?" "Nutmeg, Cardamom, Anise, Basil seeds Frankincense businesses" "Eh?! That means?" "That means business, dude!" "Oh! Do you mean business?!" "Yes, let's get into business!" "Yeah!" "Is that your ownership" Don't bother about the lost job! Your life is not to be lived counting bills at a bakery. Brother, go for any job you want. - Can you please remain silent for now? - Sorry, bro. "My responsibility " "Creating and destroying is his responsibility" The work of one of my idols is going on... Do you do exchanges? Tell us if it's possible for you. Then we will talk. I don't even have enough bucks to buy poison for myself! And you're here to sell me a five-metal idol! Come. Thank you. Pay the bill yourself. Listen, Charles... The people in the film are not idiots anymore. Please leave. "Come, my dear. Come" "If gone, it's gone. If it's wasted, it can't be regained." "Silk dhotis, silk sarees Buy them, whatever your state be" "It may take a little while, dear. That's all" Ravi... It's getting dark. Let's go. Come. Listen, that's a Tamil guy from Dhendithuruthy colony. If we don't intervene, someone else will get the item. - What's his name? - Charles. Charles... Charles! Bowl him out! Vikru... What are you writing there? Come here! Come here! Mom, I'm off. Son, wait there. - Mom, I need to go. - Come here. Mom, I've no time. Gotta go! Come here, Ravi! What is it, Mom?! Have this and go. No way! I don't have time. I'll eat outside. Come, stand here. What's it, Mom? Why have you been so restless for the last two or three days? You leave all of a sudden, and come back out of the blue! If I call to tell you anything, you hang up, saying you'll call back soon. - What's going on? - I'm not restless and all, Mom. My current job won't work out. I need to find a new job. That's okay. But don't welcome more troubles from the ones at hand. Nothing like that. Hold this. Let me go. Are you going without eating? It's enough, Mom. Please... Our Vinod is coming here. - Vinod?! - Eat it. Why? Why can't he come? Can't he come to his native place? He's coming for Christmas. So, he needs the car. Car?! Is this some corporation stand to park and take the car as per his whims? C'mon! Hasn't he put his car here for his own purpose? That's true, but... But we need to repair the car first. Then only he can take it. That's exactly why he has been calling you for the last two-three days. He asked you if you could arrange for someone to repair the car. That's not easy. Can't find anyone to repair old cars now. Then do we need people to repair new cars?! You try. If you can't, tell me. I'll arrange it. No! No! I'll arrange it. - Hold this. Enough for me. - Hey! - I'm running out of time! - Something's fishy. Oh God, somehow take this away from here! I will pay the money together next month. Okay, will be back in five minutes. What's up, Ravi? This is Smitha. My Silk Smitha! - Smitha, meet Ravi. - Ravi. Hello. What's wrong, Ravi? Why this sulky face? Nah. Nothing. Smitha, I'll be back in five minutes. Come, Ravi. What's wrong? Brother. I don't think this is gonna work out. I'm thinking of keeping the idol back to its place. If I do that, at least my mother will have peace. I'm just sick of this tension. Ravi... Don't talk like a loser! People go to God and ask for boons! God himself has come as a boon to you. Until we find an appropriate person that car will be our Ganesha's temple. That is only safe for him and us. But that is not the problem now. The corporation people are pestering on one side. Upon that, my mother told me to look for a mechanic to fix the car. The owner of the car is coming from abroad. So what?! We've got time, right? Yeah, there's time. But the person we arrange must come in our time. Otherwise, everything will blow up. No tension, brother. Our guy and our plan! Okay?! Can't you see the calling bell here? For what joy are you smashing the house? That didn't catch my eye. See if you can catch it now. Aha! It's working! Yeah. It only works when you press the switch. Who are you? Didn't you call up a guy to fix the car? Barnabas. I didn't call up any Barnabas to fix the car. I'm Barnabas. Polytechnic engineer. I called him up to repair our car. You?! This is the person I arranged when you said there's nobody who can repair the old car. Aren't you the guy sent by Charles? Charles?! Who's Charles? Don't you know Charles?! Oh-no! Mom... I've already asked someone to come and repair the car. He's on his way. In that case, won't it be a problem? - That's right. -Whoever the mechanic is, all you need is it fix it, right? That's true. But the other mechanic is already on his way! He's already here. Let him check. I'll take him to the car. What's this, bro? There's no work in there to use a polytechnic engineer's skills! Is that mace in her hand original? Why ask? I have seen it only in Hanuman's hand. It's not that. - Not from any antique dealer, right? - No, no. Brother, is there any house for rent here? - I mean, in this housing colony? - No idea. You don't know? I know two bachelors who needed a house. Oh! I do real estate as well. Brother, can you make it fast? - Open the bonnet. - Eh? Ravi, busy early in the morning? Yeah, slightly-- Need to open it inside. That's where the switch is. Oh! What a weirdo! Open it. Just move aside. That's not how you do it! I will! I will! That was the wrong key! See there. Did you open it? No. Not yet! Where's the button? There! There! Did you see it? - Okay, okay! Got it! - Pull that one. Yes, that one. - Did it open? - Check it. That's all! This is all you need to do! Will call you when my wife isn't around. What's wrong? Nothing, a slight issue with the car. Can't you sell this off? It's age-old now. Simple as that! It's all rusted. Can't you sell it and get rid of it? What? Vikru?! Written 'Vikru' on the glass... These naughty kids! Okay, carry on... Brother, try starting the car. The battery died. That was the issue. See. Okay now? - How much? - It's done. 400 rupees. - How much? - 300 rupees. I'll google pay it. Don't you have cash? Just 300 bucks. Gimme your number. I'll google pay it. We have cash. Here you go. There is a hundred rupee less. It got all the needed hundreds. Open it. What was the issue? As if you will understand if I say. Just go home, mother. Shouldn't I explain when Vinod asks me? Its battery died. That's all. No big problem and all. - That's what I asked. - And I told you. Gimme the key. I'll keep it inside. What is this?! Gimme the key, Ravi! Then take and shove it down your throat! Hello... check... check... 1... 2... 3... Mic check... 1... 2... 3... "O, golden peacock" "My dear golden peacock" "I go looney in search of you" "O, golden peacock" "My priceless peacock" "O, sweet dear, I celebrate the day I met you" "Pachaalam, Paathalam Perumanoor, Pulleppadi" "Nowhere else is such an otherworldly beauty like you" "O, golden peacock" "My dear golden peacock" "I go looney in search of you" 'Yeah, in two minutes!'

Have appetizers. It has got a strong smell... Let's go and mark our presence at the groom's house. "On the Thoppumpadi bridge" "At scorching noon," "Chatting with the breeze, I waited, sweating" "On the Thoppumpadi bridge" "On hearing the siren" "What I said never fell on your ears" "What to lose if you turn around once to me?" "O, priceless peacock" "My precious peacock" "O, sweet dear, I celebrate the day I met you" "O, marigold of Pandiyanadu O, the petal glazed by the Arabian Sea" "O, marigold of Pandiyanadu" "O, the petal glazed by the Arabian Sea" "O, milk bun, banana fritter, the savoury pepper in the pongal" "O, milk bun, banana fritter, the savoury pepper in the pongal" "O, the duck curry in the toddy shop, You, the intoxicating ghee rice" "If you turn around and look, I shall fly away" "O, my colourful peacock" Ravi, wait here. I'll be right back. Hello. Who?! This is Charles speaking. Who's this? I can't come there. You can come here if you want. I'll be here. Hey! Who are you, man? Is he your friend?! Then, tell me. Do you seek another party for the Pillaiyaar idol? You bloody dog who lives on others' remains! HEY! Hey! Stop there! Stop there! - Catch him. - Don't let go of him! Hey! Hey! Catch him. Hey! Will kill you! Stop there, you dog! Catch him! Stop man! Come this way, man. Hey! Beat him to death! You! - Hold him. - Hey! Don't let go of him. Leave him! Hey, come! They are scooting! They've escaped! Come quickly. Stop there. Come now. Hey! You better run for your life! Or I'll slaughter you! Who are they? Why were they fighting with you? Hey! Where's Ravi?! "If you say OK, I'll circle the world alone" "Here I say OK, marry me, darling" "Union of love, The celebration of marriage" "The perfect match You've found the best, buddy" "What better news than this, dear God?" "The love has come together on its own" "Need your blessings, Pillaiyaar" "O, noble folks, Mother Mary says her blessings" "Need your blessings, Pillaiyaar" "O noble folks, Mother Mary says her blessings, " Buddy! Man, Now, I'll be dancing like this on Smitha's wedding. Smitha?! Who's the groom? Oh, the groom....dude... It's you, dude! Me?! Dude! But... Isn't this our Superstar Rajinikanth's song? Superstar! Where did you disappear in between the programme? Me?! I went to see my friends. Did you stop? Hey, Ravi... Can you manage to go alone? Get lost, man! This is my colony. I'll go on my own. Should I take you home? - You go, man. - Watch your steps. If Mom sees you, it will be a pickle. Okay, good night, brother. The boy has got night blindness! Should we go and see if he has fallen in the drainage? - O my Ganesha! - Just shut up, Krishnettan. Hey, here he comes. He's here. See, he's here. - Hold him. - Why is he stumbling? Huh?! His legs are not steady! - You scared us all, Ravi! - He seems sloshed! He seems too drunk! Hema, better go home now. Where were you till now? I... I had an event. What's wrong with your phone? The guy is not used to drinking. That's why... Will get used to it eventually. I missed the calls. Alright. Thank you so much. Alright, then. Come on. Let's go. You can't even stand straight. Like father, like son! Have got all his qualities! Yes. I'm his son. This is why Dad left this house. Oh, my dear Mom! Understand one thing! People have a life at night too. Well, how can I?! You tie me up inside the house! Either inside the house or in the temple! People don't live with your kind of eyes at night. I'm not responsible for it, right? It's y'all who are responsible for these dumb eyes! Well, my life is quite delightful! Thank you, Mom. Isn't it very snowy outside, son? Snow, rain...everything is restricted for me! I have been used to these since your childhood. Once it's dark, I'll be anxious until you come in front of my eyes. Mom, people like me also live here. They celebrate their lives. For God's sake, don't label this retardation on me! I won't, my son. You have more confidence than me to live in this world. I know that. But you are my only strength. Who else do I have in my life? Mom... Sorry, Mom. Sorry. It's alright, son. It's alright. We have only each other in all our highs and lows. No matter what happens, my Lord Ganesha will protect you. Ganesha won't forsake you. - Hello? '- Ravi, where are you, man?' I'm at home. 'Brother. Get ready. There's an urgent matter.' Where are you rushing to early at dawn? Gotta some work to do. Give me a good one. - Shall we go? - Yeah, go. What's the matter? - Eh?! - Will tell you. Wait. This car... Come. Come, sit! Tea or coffee? No need for your tea and coffee! Where the hell were you, sister? Damn! Here's your advance, five lakhs! The remaining settlement after you bring the idol. Sorry, the deal has changed. Fifty lakhs won't do. HEY, WHAT?! Are you that arrogant?! Will smash your damn balls! Why? Don't you have any?! - HEY! - Boys! Calm down. Ravi... Tell me your price. Two crores. One and a half crore... That is my final! Ravi, you better take this! Have it. When will you bring the stuff? Will bring it in ten days. What? Why ten days?! Huh?! Four days. Come. Hey you, bloody Tamil guy! Huh! What?! Don't you try to act smart with that money... Kuttu Sait! Will smash your head! My Pillaiyaar, my deal! Come, man. Hey, you! Four days?! What the hell were you thinking?! Navratri celebrations are going on in the colony. Ravi... God will not forsake those who trust in Him! Help us, Oh, Ganesha, who is about to get stolen! Come. Brother, let's make a foolproof plan! Our colony people have got eagle eyes. And during the night, that loser black man would get on our nerves! Upon that, there's a movie filming going on! Even your God can't help us shift Ganesha during the daytime. And they have placed that damn CCTV camera direct opposite the car. Ravi, when shall I come then? There's only one way to bypass the security cameras and enter the colony. Corona mask! My mother is the CCTV in my house. It'd shut itself down by evening 8-8:30. And the colony inmates will go to sleep by 9-9.30 PM. 9 at night?! No way! It will be too dark, bro! When would the family in the opposite door would sleep? Can't say. They will sleep in their own time. And there's also one guy the next door as well. He's always stoned. No big deal. Taking the car keys is the riskiest deal in this. The key cannot be kept away from Mom for a prolonged time. I'll do something at night. I'll take the key and put in the 'Kuzhithali' for you. Kuzhithali, what?! Man... Kuzhithali, a large bowl in which we keep water. What's with this boy?! You take the key from it. Open the door and you know the rest. O Lord, Ganesha... Please bless me. Me too. Who's the decision maker in this colony? - Who's that? - Who?! - That's me! - Huh! You?! - Yes! - There he goes! - Come! Come! Stop! Stop! No matter what, I'll catch him today! I wanna know where these guys are headed to. You need to urgently do your Sabarimala Pilgrimage. He's not like you. Shut up. Don't you guys have any other jobs? Don't leave me alone, huh! - Check on that side. - Will he have broken into Usha's house? Come, let's check. Is this his 'Kuzhithali?' Wow! Kabali, man! - What's there? - That's me, Mom. What's wrong? See, the bowl is broken. Who broke it? It must be a rat or something. A rat broke such a big bowl?! We've got many rats, right? Maybe a cat chased it. Cat?! If the cat broke it, can't you just clean it? I was about to. Going there to clean it? Gotta pick it up, right? Seems like you are out of your mind! Throw it out and come in. Pull it. Lower, lower. A bit more! Okay, okay. Deepika Padukone. Hey, Ravi... What did you say? That your colony will drop off by 9... They usually used to! Get lost, man! Your colony was all awake as if some festival is going on! A black man, a white man... There was another man behind your house as well, do you know that?! Behind my house?! - Yeah. - Who's that? One minute. Dad... Man... Now hardly three days are left. I can effortlessly do pickpocketing. But stealing like this seems tough. Will manage it. Yeah, manage it. Ravi... Is he your father? Yeah. He seems familiar to me. C'mon! No chance! He's always on trips. Even we don't get to see him! Then what's your chance? - Get going. - See you later. Why did you call me, Dad? Ravi, who's that? He... he's a friend of mine, Charles. What does he do for a living? He sells idli batter. Don't you know the brand, Brahmana Puri idli batter? He runs a unit of that brand. What happened, Dad? You were saying about going to Chennai. Yeah, I'm thinking of going to Chennai tonight. Be cautious. There are a lot of thieves in our colony. Your mother keeps forgetting to latch the back door. You should take care of it. How do you know that? Th... That... I, too, used to live there once! Are you off? Pay the bill, huh? Shot number 4, take 14. I have an undying love for this shabby car. You're a psycho, Anirudh! The guy is not good enough. Eh?! Where did the car go?! Brother, why the car-- With your Mom's permission they moved the car towards this side. After the filming, they will keep it back in its place. The car is washed, right? We should nourish the budding artists. That's true. Hope the buds won't turn weeds in future! That's true too! Right? Tell me, brother! Man, God has shown us the way. 'The film shooting guys moved the car from the CCTV zone.' Really?! Awesome! Super! Go... go... Go. Pull over, there. Pull over. - Go and meet Sir. - What's the matter, Sir? - Go there, man. - 'Hail, my Goddess. Please give me refuge.' Sir... 'Bhajan by LKG Mahila Bhajana Seva Sangh begins immediately.' 'Hail, my Goddess. Please give me refuge.' "O, the One who rides a swan, O, Goddess Saraswati" "O, the One who rides a swan, O, Goddess Saraswati" "O, the One who rides a swan, O, Goddess Saraswati" "O, the sustainer of all the three worlds..." Come in. Hurry in before anyone sees you. Where the hell were you? How long have I been waiting?! On my way, our SI Mallu David... Mallu David?! Did he ask you anything? It was for the helmet matter. Will anything go wrong? What's this, Ravi? This is my first time in your house. Can't you at least offer tea? We have no time to waste on tea. Mom will be back home any time after Bhajan. Hey, what all are these, man? Is this a house or a museum?! - Why are these things here? - Keep it there. Those are my Mom's things. If something happens to them, I'll be dead meat. No tension, brother. It's a silly matter. I'll handle it. You go! Will that be cops?! Oh-no! Oh-no! It's you, Mom?! Why is there a veil on your head? Can you see this black cloth? Thank God! Why are you here now? Didn't wait for the Bhajan to be over? Bhajan is still going on. I just came back home. - Good. - Didn't wait for the offerings even. Don't know why... I am feeling... all sick! Have got scorching pain in both my hands. What happened? I have no clue. - Let me apply that ayurvedic oil-- - I'll get it for you. Bring it. Well, English medicines are better than ayurvedic oils. Let me bring a pain balm for you. Hurry up. Get me anything! Show me your hand. Here, this hand. It has been a few days since the pain started. I ignored it, thinking it would get better by itself. God knows! I missed the B.P. tablets for three days. That may be the reason. Whoa! Don't you know that you're not supposed to miss the B.P. tablets? ARGH! Oh-no! A rat! A rat! I saw a rat! That's a rat! Let me check! Let me check! Didn't I tell you? It's a rat! - I got startled. - Damn rat! Don't call it a damn rat. That's Lord Ganesha's vehicle. Even though the idol is gone, it is staying here to guard us. What did you eat? I... had momos. Had momos. Hell with your momos! Can't you cook something and eat? How long will it take to cook-- Did you eat anything, Mom? - What will I eat-- - There... I had some offering from the temple. Just offering won't do. You need to take tablets, right? It was unbearably sugary. Now I'm feeling heartburn! Let me drink some hot water. Actually, dry ginger coffee would be better to cure acidity. Make one for me as well. Okay, I'll make dry ginger coffee. I kept dry ginger somewhere here... where's it? Where's the dry ginger, son? It's there, there! Where's the flask? - Flask... - Nah, it's in my room. I'll bring it. No. It was here. I took it to my room yesterday. Ravi... I forgot to tell you. That policeman who came to our home, right? He was standing near that banyan tree. What's wrong? Did the cops say anything about our Ganesha idol? Why are you feeling frightened about that? Are they ever gonna trace out our idol or what? Seems like the gas stove is on. I didn't switch on the stove-- You just won't understand the seriousness. Just get out. Gas stove... who switched it on?! - Isn't it on? - Where?! Oh-no! It was not the gas stove but something else's smell. You boil the water. Let me bring the flask. "Govinda... Govinda..." 'Hail, my Goddess. Please give me refuge.' 'Winding up tonight's programmes with this.' Mom... Don't miss your pills. And try to sleep after taking pills without wasting time chanting mantras! Son, Since you start wearing these glasses you seem sleepless. Keep it away and go to bed. Okay. Bro... Where did he go?! Ravi... Ravi... Hey Ravi... Mother... Mother... Hey Ravi... hurry up... - What's wrong? - Ravi, your mother fell down. Eh?! Eh?! Mom... Mom... What happened to her? Mom! Mom! What happened to you, Mom? What's wrong with her? Mom! Mom! Hey, go and open the car door. Quick! Quickly, Ravi! Open this side. Gimme the key! Gimme the key! Open the back door. Mom! Mom! Mom! What happened to you, Mom?! - Get going, man. - Not getting started! The car does not start, Ravi! Go and push from behind. Oh-no... Mom! Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... 'The number you are calling is either switched off or not--' Shucks! Why has he switched the phone off? You look refreshed now. You're not supposed to miss the B.P. pills. If you keep skipping medicines, such incidents would repeat. She will never skip her pills from now on. I'll take care of it. Good for you! What are you even doing? Sit here, Kumarettan. C'mon, sit. Sir...? If everything goes well, she can be discharged tomorrow. - Really? - Okay. Thank you, Sir. Good God! That's a relief! Hello? Where are you, man? 'Ravi, how's your mother?' Mom is better. Where did you go? 'Come to the parking lot.' Parking lot?! - What happened? Anything wrong?! - 'Come, man!' 'Come to the parking lot near the new building.' Yeah, I'm walking down. Don't fall sick worrying about the idol, Gomathi. They consulted the astrologer again. Another idol will do. - Huh?! - Will enshrine a new idol very soon. Somebody, please go to the bill counter. Be seated, Kumaran. I'll see to it. You are really lucky, mother. It is God's grace that they could bring you here on time. It's my God himself who brought me here. I saw Him, Kumaretta. "Pillaiyaar..." "Pillaiyaar..." 'Did you reach?' Yeah, I'm here. 'Don't hang up the call.' Tell me the matter, man. 'Did you see our car?' I'm just there. 'The key is near the number plate.' Number plate... Got the keys. Where are you, man? 'Check the place where you kept the idol. There's your money.' Eh?! Charles... you?! Bro... So, everything worked well, right? 'I could do it, right?' 'Aren't you happy?!' Man... where are you? It's just the work that got over. Our friendship is still going on. - Hey-- - Ravi! Why are you goofing around here? - I... - See the bill, a whole 56,000 rupees. Does your mother have any health insurance? - No. - Do you have any money? Come on! Who am I asking?! If you get better, we can go home today itself. Come, son. Come here. Why do you look gloomy? Sit here. I'm alright, sonny. Mom... - Idol... I-- - Uh-oh! Velayudhan, who came to harvest coconuts in your mom's ancestral home, got the idol from the coconut tree's crown. All these conflicts and rebellion are on that! Do my Gomathi's God dwells inside a mere idol? I'll put an end to this child's play today! Anyways, 'Utsava murti' is meant to be portable and roaming around everywhere. And where's 'Brahma murti?' Residing here! In your heart! My child is so naive. Hurry up, son. Here I come. You Dad called a couple of times. New scooter, new salwar and all! Where are you off to! - That's a surprise! - Off to admit Ravi to school! In Division A, First grade, Amritha Vidyalaya School. "O flying time, O swift world" "Where are you heading?" "O flying time, O swift world" "Days keep moving on" "Like lives and stories..." "O flying time, O swift world" How's the shop, Dad? Did you like it? It's a cool business, huh! People can't stop buying this even if they are broke! C'mon! The world changes in no time, Mohanan. There is only one thing that does not change. The faith that blinds us. - So what? Everything ended up well, right? - Of course! - C'mon! - Ravi bro... Come, come... Okay? The shop's name is superb! Aced it! " Like a melody of life" " like a tune, us... " "Every story before us turns mystic and fallacious" 'Charles Enterprises' 'Hail to you...' 'Hail to you, O, Lord Ganesha!' 'Hail to you, O, the bestower of serenity!'
