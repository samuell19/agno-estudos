Christ, divine master, loved by all who have strength to love, unconsciously, by those who do not know You, longingly, by those who know of You. Christ, You are my hope, my peace, my happiness, my whole life. Christ, to You my spirit turns, Christ, it is to You I pray, Christ, to You I hold on with all the strength in my soul; it is You alone, Lord, that I do love. I search for You and follow in Your path. Hey Jakob. - Hey. Hey! Attack, attack! Okay. Well held! What was up? - What's with you? Well, tell us. No, don't. Okay, do. What? - Well... Sure. No, believe me... Cheers. - Well, dear brothers... I'm amazed you still go drinking with riffraff, to be honest. - Yes. It won't happen again. You know, I think it's right. You now have an appropriate position, can finally mount a huge brass plaque on your desk. And we can change our goalie. Although you were pretty good, I think. You do know the drinks are on you? - I do. So, three shots, guys... Thanks. - Well... To the staff manager. - And the deputy vicar general. And... What? And my new city deacon. What? Boy, that's fantastic! Seriously? - Yes. The cardinal wants to appoint you in three months. So now we're calling the shots. Cheers. We'll find something for you, too. - No way. I'm where I belong. - We'll talk it over. No, we won't talk it over. - Yes, we will. I'd like three more schnapps. Not for me, thanks. Make that two. Or five! So... See you soon. - See you soon. Straight ahead. - Yes! -Yes! Say... Why don't we hold mass together again? Me, you, concelebration... Good? - Yes. It's been a long time. Before you get fat at your desk. - I love you, too. Till Sunday. - Till Sunday, BrotherJakob. THE CULPABLE Be our salvation when we are awake and our keeper when we sleep. That we keep vigil with Jesus and rest in his peace. Lord God, send us this night a peaceful sleep that we may recover from the labours of the day and serve You with renewed vigour tomorrow. This we pray through Christ the Lord. May the Almighty Lord grant us a peaceful night and a good end. Amen. Miserable little wanker! - Ball-buster! You ugly little pig! - Filthy swine! Douche! Can't do shit, huh? Your parents are siblings, you dick! - Cock sucker. Shit-stinking moron! - Ball-breaker. -Wanker! Come and get some, or am I too manly for you? Okay, that's enough. Respect. You did well, Raul. Five minute break? - Yes. Frank... Little kiddy-fucker! - Arse... Chill out! Quit it! - Cool off! Leave off. - Raul? Come with me. We'll go outside. Everything okay? - Slowly... Raul! In life, things happen without warning. But each time you lose it. Do you have a cigarette? What am I to fight for? Your daughter? I'm all the fucking same to her. She hasn't answered one of my letters. Does that surprise you? What? I was considering your hostage value. That's the Raul I know. Don't give up. Please. And if you have one second's doubt, I'm here for you. I'm not one of the pedos. The woman was 20. Does that make it better? He flipped out. It happens. Nobody said the method functions for everyone. Yes? I noticed that. Some of everything, please. Then don't let it get to you. Without vegetables, please. But I have to let it get to me. Enjoy. Thieves, murderers and rapists. They all want to get out. And I come with coffee and cigarettes. You're to blame. You're giving them cancer. You're a marvelous psychologist. You finishing that? - Well... I was born to share. Mr Bertram? Dominik Bertram? Yes? Sasse, CID. This is my colleague, Mr Teschner. Hello. What's this about? We'll explain everything, please accompany us to the station. What? Dominik? - Yes... We're on. - Yes. We're about to say mass, the congregation are waiting... could we speak afterwards? Yes. Go ahead. Thanks. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever, amen. "For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them." This is the word of the Lord. And so we pray. Our Lord Jesus Christ Look not on our sins, but on the faith of Your Church, and grant us the peace and unity of Your kingdom. The peace of the Lord be with you always. And also with you. Let us offer one another a sign of peace. What... what's going on here? Father Bertram is accompanying us to the station. It'll soon be dealt with. I'll call you. Thank you. - Gladly. Officially you're here because of the visitation. Don't mention Dominik. We're up to our necks in shit. I know. - No, you don't. No forewarning, no clue, nothing. The public prosecutor called two hours after you. It's great for his career. The magistrate played along: "Attempted cover-up, etc, etc..." We've applied, but a remand-review takes time. Dominik? Well? You want me to tell you it was me, huh? You know there's no truth to it. There's been a statement. This Mike, Mike Rubin... knows details, physical... physical details. Oh, my God. From Youth Club, swimming, football... Swimming! Read it. It's full of vile things. Dominik... Dominik, you've got to give me something tangible. How can the boy... describe this in these terms? He's a difficult boy... They all are, you know the neighbourhood... Typical! Initially they're enthusiastic... -... then they frame you! Now we're in the shit. - Olli! Stop it now! The statement doesn't necessarily mean a thing. Where did you get it, anyway? - The lawyer. On the quiet. Might something have turned the boy against you? Or his family? Erm... What? His mother is divorced, she works in a bakery round the corner... and does cleaning work to get by... I took care of the boy, as I do of all of them. That wasn't in divinity class. They need intensive supervision. What does that mean? - What it means? It means help with homework. It means the sport program. It means crisis intervention. They sleep at the Club if things are bad at home. Have you visited their homes, know what they're like? I alone was interested in these boys... now they're looking down my pants! Yes. Good. The... We've applied for a remand-review but it'll take a while. We'll get you out of here. That's the first thing. Jakob... Could you get me a change of clothes from home? This is all I've got. Yes. Hello. Excuse me, what are you doing there? Collecting some things for my friend, Mr Bertram. That won't do. Please wait outside till we're finished. Okay. I'll be waiting outside. We should be grateful to Dominik for saving those kids from the street. They can be real bastards, but... no one else will give them a chance. Instead of which... - We need you in here. How much longer will this take? Hey... say... There's a bakery close by, right? - Yap. Where? Where? Hello. - Excuse me. I'm sorry. I've got to go home, Mike's back for lunch. So, how can I help you? - Err... I'd like a currant bun, please. Bye, see you later. - Bye. Keep the change. Are you following me? What do you want? Didn't like the bun or what? No, I... Are you from the press? - No... certainly not. My name is Jakob V?lz... I'm a priest. Did your people send you? Dominik Bertram is a friend of mine. Wait... Wait! - What? I'm just trying to understand what happened. You don't understand that? - No, I... I'm sorry... Why are you sorry? Because your friend touched my child? What? No. That is... - Leave my mother in peace. Get lost. Get lost. Most of the photos he got as presents from the kids. How about a coffee, after all? No. No, thank you. That's all I got, "It'll work out fine..." For most of them here, that's not true. So I don't say it... I found this while I was packing... That's Mike, right? For Youth Camp. "Intensive supervision." It's a photo. There are dozens of them. It looks peculiar. Jakob, most people find us peculiar. The job itself is peculiar... If it were my friend, I'd need someone to talk to... I don't need your therapy now... - Jakob... I'm here as a friend... He was pretty shocked in custody but mostly he's solid. Good news. Priest-like failings are evident: Retardation of adolescence, sexual sublimation, repressed ability to sublimate... but who am I telling this to? And you found all that out in 45 minutes? - You're not listening. I said indications. 45 minutes are enough. If you listen. So he did touch up little boys? That's what you're suggesting. - I didn't say that. But it's not impossible. - Susanne, I've known him 15 years. Doesn't mean you know who he is. Papa... Jakob is here... You remember? Jakob V?lz? Hello, Mr Gondek. Want a drink? Papa... Don't touch the... Don't touch it, please... He beat me until I was 16. As he did Richard and Martin. Richard taught me to shove a newspaper down my pants... It didn't help much. We always stuck together, knew where we were from. I'm concerned about Dominik. It was all I needed! Freshly appointed and I'm getting it from parish and cardinal! What if there's truth in it? What if there's truth in it? I... I found a picture at his... I don't know, it's just a hunch. - Please keep your hunches to yourself. What's up with you? Don't go along with any shit... - Oliver, what if... Someone's blackening his name! Shit sticks if there's a lot. Who or how, whatever! I just want it over with. Lamb of the Lord, You take away the sins of the world: Have mercy on us. Lamb of the Lord, You take away the sins of the world: Have mercy on us. Lamb of the Lord, You take away the sins of the world: Grant us peace. We like to look away. It's easy, it's human... And it's dangerous. But to do otherwise, to not turn away, is accursedly difficult. Because it means going up against others. Against prevalent opinions and rules... - It's why I'm doing time! Let me guess, for double parking? So, gentlemen... See, the lamb of the Lord, that takes from you the sins of the world. Lord, I'm not worthy... -... that You should enter under my roof; but only send the word and my soul shall be healed. Double parking? I don't know if I could handle it. You get used to it. You're good. Really. I'm full of admiration. Is there any truth in it? What's with the question? Did you touch up the boy? - Come off it! You really think I might have? - Why did he call the cops? Who knows? Because... Because... maybe he misunderstood something. Yes... Maybe... yes... maybe... I took too much trouble... Gee, you know how boys are. The boundaries grow porous. It was nothing, really. It... It just happened. You need to go back to your cell now. False accusations don't help us here at all. I am certain that it's true... I can't hear it any more... - Please calm yourselves... Investigations are ongoing. - We know how your lot "investigate"! Listen, Father Gondek is right... We are speaking about Father Bertram, after all, who has done so much in our parish. - Particularly to our children! Please... please be calm. Father Bertram is on leave till the matter is settled. Father Lehnhardt of Holy Spirit Church will fill in for him... I understand your unease... But... Please! We must give sincere consideration to the idea that Father Bertram has been falsely accused. Please... Silence, please... - Please... Mr Djokovic will now speak. - Many of you know me... My children attend this church and my son... here... does church youth work. Back in the day, the priest helped us when we arrived here. Yes... And today I hear many, many lies. Many lies. I trust the priest. The man is innocent. Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm. Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm... What are you doing here? - He did it. I beg your pardon. - He did it. Says who? - He does. He admitted it. Oh, shit. Shit! We've got to take care of it... Take care how...? We have to sort it out. We owe it to him. Olli, this isn't some slip. - Maybe not. But we can't let him down. You of all people should understand. What does that mean? - What do you actually know? You know what he did? - He... admitted it. Admitted what? - Are you saying... Shame on you, Mr Gondek! You... are familiar with the boy's statement. You mean to question its validity? - You know all the stuff he made up? Are you kidding? - You know how these things go. A small indiscretion turns into a huge affair. "A small indiscretion?" Have you gone mad? Remember your little parish-speaker girl? Yes... You know the kind of people who are always writing to the ordinariate? Or did you think it had gone unremarked. I didn't touch a child. - Thank God. But don't act like Goody-Two-Shoes. He made a mistake, yes... But it's not for us to judge him. He needs a friend now, not a judge. You look like a little girl. Come over with some butter. I'll break your back, you fag... Clamp your butt-cheeks together. - Hey, Sweetie! -Degenerate! Pussy! - Want a punch in the gob? That's enough. Dennis, you did well. You've made progress. Really. Thanks, boys. See you... Thursday. Okay. Jakob... Jakob... He's seeing his kiddy-fucker today. What? - Seeing your kiddy-fucker. Listen up, loser! You beat your girlfriend till she was crippled. All day long we just eat your shit. I'm sick of it! I'm fine, it's okay. Great. You do know you just ruined six weeks of work? It's all getting on top of me... I can't sleep. Graubaum. Zdrojewski, Raul? -... Schneider... May I briefly... - Yes. -Come here. The last day of trial. I'm to give a statement again. It won't help anyway. You don't know that. - I do. Don't make it so easy for yourself. We can talk it over afterwards if you like. It won't help me at all. I don't wear a dog collar like you. Or your colleague up there. - Zdrojewski, get in. He's bound to be out again soon. You guys stick together. Sorry. Stressful work. You don't get to choose. Actually, one does. - You might... I see. - Is there something you don't get? You've no idea what it's like. Long divorced but receiving no alimony, nothing but debts and a 15-year-old at home... And what the hell did I do wrong? When my own child says a man touched him... If I had a daughter, she'd probably be pregnant. Sorry. - No... What's with you? - Excuse me? You don't want to hear this, huh? Am I being intrusive or what? I'm sorry, I can't help you. Am I some stain on your nice white collar or what? Arsehole! Mikey, will you come and eat? How were things today? - Good. Say, when is your English test? Wednesday next week. - Wednesday. Would you pass me your bowl, please. On Tuesday there's the appointment with... the assessor. Salt... Thanks. Can you handle it? I mean, before your English test? We'll make it, the two of us. Sure. No news in three weeks. Could you please ask? I'm on it. Don't worry, okay? Anything else? - Could you get me a bit of tobacco? Sure. - Thank you, Father. How bad? - Hard to say. It was hard to make anything out. No! Hello. - Hello. Numerous haematoma. Some contusion to the ribs... Dominik! - We're moving him now. I'm sorry. He's being x-rayed. He was very lucky. There you are. Are you hiding? I just need a minute. Want to take time off? Oh... no. There's some truth in it, right? Jakob, you don't have to deal with this alone. I know how hard it is. - What do you know? You know nothing at all. Stop with that. You poke and pry, make insinuations, and now you can see it all, crystal clear. Don't you think I can see what's with you? You can't carry on as if... - Susanne, stop with the psycho-shit. Not with me! Yes... Olli... Oliver, Dominik has been severely assaulted. Pipe down! Things happen with people like those in here. Oh God! What? Whether it's been documented? I've no idea. Don't peek! - I could take your hands away. No. - I'm not a child anymore. A few more steps... Yes... Further, further, further... No! - Happy birthday! Congratulations. Congratulations. Thanks for bringing it. - ... the keys... But I can't pay you till next month. Come on, Mama. We're off for a spin! Now? - Yes, sure. Oh, this is great. Let me help you. Wait... This one? - Yes. -Okay... The lawyer has applied for bail. Olli called me. He says you might be out in three days. Three days? Friday, yes? Yes. Thank you. I'm finished. We can go. That was great. Can you give me a drink? Thanks. Rubin... Hello. Good, yes? What? But why? We... That means they're releasing him. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to You, Lord Jesus Christ! We pray for all those who are suffering, for the sick, for those betrayed by those that they love, for those who must withstand injustice. Lord, hear our prayer. We pray for the people of our parish who have brought guilt upon themselves and not yet found the way back to forgiveness. Lord, hear our prayer. For the people who in their craving always seek new worldly goods yet remain unhappy, Lord, hear our prayer. For the people who have made the imitation of our Lord Christ their goal in life: The ministry, priests and deacons... women and men serving their parish and in missions... in the developing world... Lord, hear our prayer. Hey! Okay... Jerko. Jerko... Too much incense, I suppose. It sometimes gets to the boys. Thank you. Have a drink. Excuse me. It's not a problem. Huh? You're better now, huh? There you are. Go and get some fresh air. Ms H?hner will accompany you, okay? - Thank you. Excuse us. - It's quite all right, Mr Djokovic. Mr Djokovic? - Yes? My name is Jakob V?lz, I helped carry your son into the vestry. Oh... the other priest. - Yes, exactly. I'll buzz you in. Second floor. - Thanks. Say hello to the priest. Hello. - Hello. What was your name again? Jerko. - Jerko? What a nice name. - It's after his uncle. He was killed. In 1994. By Chetniks. Thank you. For your help. My pleasure. Won't you join us for a moment? Come on. Do you often go to Youth Club? It must be cool. You sometimes sleep over, right? Sometimes. It's a good thing, for me, as a single father of two. He's in good hands there. And this is my daughter. Timea. Hello, Timea. - Hello. Do you go to Youth Club, too? - No. There are too many boys. Thanks. - My pleasure. And I guess... you get on well with Father Bertram. Dominik. It's outrageous what's been said about him. Yes... But he'll be back soon... That is great. Things will be as they were. What's this? - Can I go? Jerko! - Jerko, you don't want Dominik to return. Right? - What's this all about? If anything happened... - Nothing did. Nothing! My boy is a perfectly normal boy. No. I don't know what he wants. What happened? - Don't interfere! And you, you come to our house... asking strange questions! - I'm sorry! We are good Christians! Please... Go away. Do you think God will forgive me? No. He hasn't even condemned you. The Lord will catch your fall... no matter what the hell you've done or will do. In the name of the people we deliver this verdict: The accused, Raul Zdrojewski, is guilty of rape with fatal consequences. He is to serve ten years as provided for in the penal code. Given the gravity of the offence, he is to be kept in custody after the punishment's term has been concluded. Over to you! Yes, sir! - Gee! Cover! Again! Hey! - Here. Come on! Get him! Take him down! Come on! - The ball is lost! That was quick! - Get him! Are you crazy? Jakob, what's up? Are you okay? - Yes. Leave off. You sure? - Yes. Leave off. Jakob! Hey! No sooner is he home than the altar boys start fainting, yet he's here like nothing happened. - Are you paranoid? Another indiscretion. - No one's listening! You're not listening! Papa? Christ, divine master, loved by all who have strength to love, unconsciously, by those who do not know You, longingly, by those who know of You, Christ, You are my hope, my peace, my happiness, my whole life. Christ, to You my spirit turns, Christ, it is to You I pray, Christ, to You I hold on with all the strength in my soul; it is You alone, Lord, that I do love. It is You alone, Lord, that I do love. I search for You and follow in your path. Schmitz found him at 3:30 this morning. We did the regulation checks every 15 minutes, but... he must have timed it. This was on the bed. Why did he do it? I could have prevented it. You did all that can be done. - No! I did not! "I hope you're right and God will save me." What am I to say to his daughter? God, what is all this chaos here? Leave it be. Jakob... There's another boy. How long have you known? A couple of days, it's immaterial. That means he's guilty but he's at his liberty. That's obstructing justice. You have to report it. I cannot. That's what I don't like about any of you. I thought you were just obstinate, but you're not obstinate, you're like the rest. Like soldiers. You lie to yourself to maintain your little idyll. I can't prove it. - What proof do you need? You can't just keep quiet. How can you justify it to yourself? And don't give me that seal-of-confession shit! Which I just broke for you! You're so... Mr V?lz. - Your Eminence. This way, please. Modern society... ...is in a poor condition. We embody that which many people yearn for: Stability, stalwartness, faith... Be seated. Thank you. I consider you a man of integrity, Mr V?lz. Which is why I can imagine the reason for your visit. I... think... I know that the accusations made against Dominik Bertram are justified, and I have reason to believe that... another boy is also involved. He confided in you? - In one matter, yes. This is... a very painful truth. One we must pursue, your Eminence. We must be compassionate, Mr V?lz. And the families? - That goes for the families, too. It is not our task to investigate. Our task is to help and to forgive. The church may have its failings. It may be old-fashioned or too severe, but it is a mother. And one does not beat a mother. Thank you for your confidence. I do respect it. Yes... Thank you. I'd be delighted to see you at the ordination in two days. Now, more than ever, we need your prayers for the ordinands. Jakob! You saw the old man? - Don't act surprised. You're not making things easy. - They aren't. For anyone. Wait up. Yes, I knew you would come here. And it's good you did. In what way? Sch?ller left me high and dry. He is in favour of compassion. "The church is a mother and one does not beat a mother." Yes! Yes... we must treat the matter with uttermost caution. We keep quiet and wait till the dust has settled? Don't be so self-righteous. The subject has caused so much friction, but it benefits no one if we panic. We'll investigate the matter with the Croatian boy. And Dominik? - I'll have him take a fall. You can count on it. What about the families? I'm taking care of them. - Meaning? Jakob, we are on the same team. Let me do my job and you can do yours. We regret your situation and would like to help. We are not your enemies, Mr Djokovic. The press may say so, but we stand with you. We will ensure that all allegations are pursued conclusively. I promise you that. My son is ill. He needs help. - And he will get it. We have excellent facilities that could help him. We will do all in our power to support you. You're buying your way out of it. - No, Ms Rubin. We are helping... you and your son. We are aware of our responsibilities. - And that's the end of it? I'm afraid you underestimate the situation. Don't be persuaded that a civil action would improve your lot. No one is interested in escalation. This is coercion. Perhaps I did not express myself clearly. Do you really want to expose your son to this? Having to make statement after statement in court? There's no certainty they'll find in your favour. What your son needs is to heal. This offer is the best thing that you can do for your child. Would you pass me a glass of wine? Monsignore Becker! White or red? - White. Mr V?lz! To our new fellows. The affair with your colleague... We often forget how important clear boundaries are. Youth and a lack of experience... sometimes lead to errors. Inexcusable ones. I tried to make it clear to him. I thought he'd understood back then. Might I speak to you for an instant? I thought it would all work out. After all, you haven't lost a son but have gained four new ones. What's wrong? - I'm going to the prosecutor. You are not. - Becker filled me in. On what? - He reprimanded Dominik years ago! Pull yourself together. Come! You will do nothing. Come off it! - This plainly has to be solved internally. People leave in droves over this kind of thing! Think: hospitals, schools, kindergartens. We are in a position of responsibility. Is the whole lot at stake here or what? Dominik has been systematically abusing! I won't play along. You kept quiet, too. Yes. But now I cannot anymore. How can you reconcile it with your faith? - Because it protects it. While washing dirty laundry in public does not. We'll lose our credibility. We have long since lost our credibility! We regain it by standing tall. Why can't you see that? Because we stick together, for better or for worse. Don't you remember? You knew? - I knew nothing at all. But we should have noticed. Yes. Jakob... be sure you know which side you're on. Could you tidy away? What, are you deaf? Have a nice day. Hello, how can I help? - Two croissants, please. One moment, please. Could you take over a second? - Sure. Hello, how can I help? Two croissants, please. Hello. Your colleague let me through. What do you want? I wanted to apologise to you. Now? Where the thing is over for you? How enchanting! - What's that you say? Your colleague did a good job. You didn't know about it? You let yourself be bought? I did the only thing left for me to do. Because I'm at my wit's end. Now you cause a scene as your conscience is bad and you wish me the same. Because I don't play along! - No. Yes! You just want to keep your hands clean. - I didn't mean to... I... just want to be a normal mother to my son again. To do my job... and to fall in love again. A perfectly normal life. Can you understand that? Jakob! You've really lost your overview, haven't you? I don't know what you mean. The son of a divorcee, an emigrant... who were the others? Stories! Stories, huh? Nothing happened. - Don't talk shit. You abused them for years. I abused no one. The Croatian boy pisses his pants if he only hears your name. You raped them, you pig! You subjected them to violence! - No! I fell in love! You are mad. You are completely mad. You're... completely crazy. No! - They are children! They are children! They are children, Dominik. I am... not better or worse than you. We are brothers, Jakob. We are brothers. You can no longer be a priest. Who do you take yourself for, huh? Who do you think you are, that you can decide this for me? That you can decide anything at all here? I built up so much here. I did so much for this parish. How do you know I can't change? We are friends, damn it! Why do you throw it all away? You do know who I am. You do know who I am. You do know who I am. I have no idea who you are. Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye but don't notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye', and, look, there's a log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. DISTRICT ATTORNEY
