Hey larry. Hey Matt. How are you ? Good. How are you doing ? Very good thank you. Thanks for doing this shoot. No problem. Do you mind if I sit here ? Yeah. Go ahead. I've had MS since 2000. And now I can't move anything below my neck. After I was diagnosed I let go from my job. I went on some experimental drug programs. that just made me seem worse Tired. Feeling nausea. And I was taking needles in my body every few days The Rebif. The Avonex. I went through all those drug trials And it just felt one scam you know. What's going on ? Why isn't it ... Why isn't it doing anything ? They have so many millions of dollars. Where does it go ? What do they do with it ? There is nothing to show. Just help me man. You have to be incredibly tough. To fight Multiple Sclerosis. it's like you got your worst enemy inside you. I had the overwhelming feeling that life was over. And there was nothing worth living for anymore. My legs went numb. And I went basically blind. I was like ''Game over''. This is on the rise. Many MS patients are holding out hope that a medication will be found This what it looks like. A million and a half don't even know that they have it right now. That's a ticking time bomb. MS is a disease where the immune system goes astray. And thinks that the brain and spinal cord shouldn't be there. And tries to attack it. It's a long needle that goes into your muscle. I take Tysabri, Copaxone ... (inaudible) Prodcuer and director Matt Embry was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. We believe there is about a half million people in the United States. Maybe over two million people in the world. I've just had a baby. How could I have MS ? Multiple Sclerosis remains a mystery. No cure exists. I've got one of those insidious chronic diseases on this planet. We gotta stop the lies about illnesses like this and start telling the truth. How much higher can the stakes be ? it's billions and billions of dollars. And yet the system is setup in such a way. That it can be corrupted, easily. I was like shaking and crying, and I felt so vulnerable. Goodbye, guys. All of a sudden I get a phone call from my brother. That Matt had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. And I mean I literally almost clapped. I mean I couldn't believe it. I really didn't have any idea at all. Untill that one day he said ''I think I had a stroke'' And we said ''what ?'' He said ''I juts got all this numbness and sensitivity on my side''. I knew very ... very ... very little about Multiple sclerosis except it was sort of bad. I was a nurse before, so it had a huge influence on my image of MS. It was tough those first few weeks, cause I think all of us didn't know what to say to each other. we were all just pretty shocked and pretty devastated. So bizarre to have this feeling that, you know, my older athletic brother. Was fairly quickly going to degenerate and be on a wheelchair. It's always a pretty crashing stigmatism around it. That just ... You have MS and you're done, right. When we got the word. It was like someone punched me in the gut. And I really thought it was kind of a death sentence. And so I have to admit I broke down. I mean I started to cry and I was just like: ''Here is my nephew. At the prime of his life and being handed a death sentence''. Pretty devastating. I knew it would affect the whole family. And to watch a loved one's body deteriorate and their mind. I think it's probably the most brutal thing that ... can happen to a parent. And to also the person that has MS. Sorry ... Sorry ... You Don't want that for anybody. (indistinct) Okay. I'm George Ebers and I'm a neurologist and MS researcher. My aunt died of MS, aged 30. I never knew her. But that had some influence on me because I thought. Well, if there is some genetic bond that might be relevant to our own family. I remember thinking there are so many clues, you know. That should take me about a weekend to sort of. Did a lot of reading about it, and it's taken longer than a weekend. MS is all the things that make life difficult in terms of a solution. And no matter what question has been asked in MS. You hardly going to get a black and white answer. There is like, sort of shades of grey. The things that are thought to be important are early life exposures, like infections. Probably some aspects of diet. Sunshine exposure and likely mediator there is vitamine D. And, then there are other things which are random triggers. The first part of the disease seems to be autoimmune and inflamatory mediated. But the second part, is what matters. The second part is what disables people. The second part is what counts for most of the grief. First part is treatable. Second part doesn't seem to be. Pharmaceutical industry they would argue they're not giving any false hope. What they're doing is they're saying that this drug will do this, this, this and this. Which has been shown. So if you look it says it reduces the attack rate by 30%. 50%, right ? But, when you ask them ''Okay well does it make any difference in the time it would take for me to reach a wheelchair ?'' ''Or, in the time it'd take me to develop a secondary aggressive disease ?'' You can see they don't have any evidence for that. So if people get this progressive thing happening. Then there is no evidence that any treatment. Actually makes that better or prevents it from getting worse. So when someone comes along and says. ''We've shown that are fewer wheelchairs required'' I'll be pleased and satisfied. Haven't seen it. I unfortunately have tried 5 in 6 FDA approved medicines. All of which were unsuccessful in slowing my disease I have hope, that the research that's being conducted. Is going to be successful. We keep telling ''long term progression'', ''long term progression''. like a natural course of disease. It's like I just can't help but think. Hey once the switch got turned on, yeah I got it. am I fighting it ? yeah I'm fighting it but it's like. Once that swith is on it's just a countdown. There is John Plaxter who's your great great grandfather. You see he was born in 1846 and I was born in 1946. -Okay so he's great great grandfather. So who built it ? he built this thing like he created this tomb ? Yeah yeah. And then they just kept put them in as they died. Until they filled it up with 6 bodies. He's the one who made all the money. My brother said when he died he was worth in today's money 5 million. I always saw you see. Money doesn't buy happiness. - No. Cause I saw this family. - Yeah. They all had tons of money and they just. They drank and they just It wasn't a happy family. - No it was disaster. So that was the best thing I ever learned. Money and happiness have a very very low correlation. Nothing has changed my mind on that. If they built you a big tomb, they'll creep you. You and mom don't have a plaster or any of that, do you ? No, I'm gonna scatter my ashes to the winds of the arctic. - Right. So I'm gonna need somebody to haul them up there Yeah I'll do it. I was sure they should have drugs, and they should have a way of dealing with this. And when the doctor said no, there is no drugs. There is nothing we can do. And we just have to hope. Then that really was the time to set in this is a real, serious problem So immediately your mind starts saying ''Ok, there has to be''. ''I have to try and figure out what the heck is going on'' Hello doctor. - How do you do Matt ? Good. - Nice to see you. Thanks for doing this. - Alright, our pleasure. Truthfully, I thought you guys were just sort of a scam. It might be a scam if you weren't talking to someone who's been doing brain surgery. Legitimate brain surgery for 23 years with an impeccable reputation. I have a lot to lose if I were looked at that way. Our model MS patient. The last time she was able to walk without a walker was 10 years ago. So she came to us for a stem cells. And we believe that stem cells can hone in on areas of damage. Find them selectively. And repair them. And regenerate them hopefully. You need to repair the damage that's been done by your own body. I think stem cell work should start with your own stem cells. You being the pharmaceutical industry. You are the factory. The stem cells were taken from the patient's own abdominal fat. So the patient comes in. Gets the liposuction. And an hour later, the cells are ready to be implanted into the brain. And what happened ? We agreed to treat her. She fit the criteria. And she had her first stem cells implanted back in Mai. Of 2014. And she's had a miraculous recovery. She started with a walker being able to walk 1 inch at a time. Most recently, she's walking without any limitation. And she walks at least 25 feet in 1 minute. She's making an amazing progress. And word is she's driving a car now. Hello. Do you want us to come in this way ? Oh it just got stuck. And now you're still driving yourself to the clinic ? Do I think stem cells can reverse a patient whose already had the damage done ? In my opinion, the potential is there. Especially with what we have seen already with a few of our patients. It's extremely optimistic for me. I love what we are seeing. What I'm hoping to do is to have a larger study. We just need some financial support, would be great. So that there would be no out-of-pocket expense for the patient. Shouldn't there be significant industry interest in this ? You would think so. Yes I would think there will be significant industry interest in moving forward with this. But where the industry wants to go is produce a drug. In the form of a stem cell, right. So a drug in the form of a stem cell is a stem cell that's been altered. A stem cell that's been induced. And that becomes their product. So there is an incentive for them to create that prodcut. And then get FDA approval to use that product. And then it becomes their product. Right now the product that we use is the patient's product. They're the production factory. And furthermore, are the stem cells going to create a monster ? That is the big question. And so we just need to follow up, and see how these patients do. Thank you so much for doing this. - Thank you so much. Okay, we're gonna do it, okay ? - Okay thank you. Thank you. I knew what I was walking into. It's easier to talk to doctors and specialists. And when you're like looking right in the eye of it. That's the darkness. Right ? That's the viciousness of disease. Right ? Yeah it's though. I knew it. Just like. Jesus, I gotta live feeling sick. I gotta live feeling like I have symptoms. I gotta live feeling like I'm going down hill. Okay. (indistinct) You see that desperation. Right ? Just like. You wanna help. what can I do here right ? Hey there. How are you ? - Good. How are you doing ? Good. -Matt. Good to see you honey. Traveler. You've been all over the world. Yeah. It's been a pretty good run. He's been everywhere. Well come on in. Come on in. Welcome. Welcome. I better turn off my screen. There are some spoilers on that There are some House Of Cards spoilers on there. That's great. Are you feeling good ? Yeah. I pretty much been stable for quite a few years. Since diagnosis 9 years ago. What happenend ? How did you know ? Yeah it was a flare. I mean it was the numbness thing. Started in the arm. Went down to the leg. And by the time I got back from Austin in a film festival. I was like man there is something. I gotta get this checked out. I had an MRI. And boom there it is you know. The early years especially were very kind of terrifying. In the sense that our son was still quite young at the time. So I'm a dad. I've got a career. I'm a husband. And I had a lot of uncertainty about what I was gonna be able to continue doing. Cause you know, one of the first things you learn about MS. Is there is a lot of uncertainty in terms of the type and course it's gonna take you know. I mean I have friends in their thirties and on wheelchairs. We met in college and got married in college So this is my best friend. And seeing him suffering and feeling helpless. I wanted to figure out how to help him. That was my number one goal. And so that's why I started digging into research. Because I think you're gonna say your neurologist really didn't give us anything concrete. it was just ''well we don't know what this disease is'' ''It's incurable, you have it. Good luck'' And she actually said to him '' do everything you wanna do now'' Because his prognosis as a man with the kind of presentation he had was not good. So that's when I got serious about learning what this disease was. And reading the research. I started reading PubMed And I kept coming up with a lot of vascular connections. And when Doctor Zamboni's research was published. I sent it to Doctor John Cook at Stanford. Who had been my contact there. And I just had him read it. And I said ''Do you think there is anything here ?'' And he gave it to his colleague Michael Dake. I, of course, never heared anything about it. It sounded kind of outlandish. A little left field you know. It goes against a lot of dogma. And a lot of what we believed to be true. In practice of treatment of MS. And I am not a neurologist. I am not an MS doctor. But I've been always open to listening to these things. And we talked about it. And sort of how together is a pathophysiological response that we see in other parts of the body. In many places of the body we deal with veinous narrowing. Whether it's the legs, the liver, the kidneys. And we're very comfortable with that. We never thought about could there be similar veinous narrowings in the neck. That might affect the brain. Why wouldn't there be ? You know Mike Dake said well let's just look at Jeff right ? Let's just look and see what's going on. We studied with MRI. And lo and behold. What we saw was identical to what was being seen by Doctor Paolo Zamboni. The pictures were almost superimposable. So indeed he did have veinous narrowing. Of a significant degree. And again this was sort of to us kind of almost shocking. You know we never heared of this. And yet here it was. Identical in this first patient to what was shown overseas. It was real. His jugular veins were completely closed off. I mean we could see that on the MRV. And there was collateral circulation. And as Doctor Dake said. You know ''I treat this''. This is the first time I talk to a doctor really since I was diagnosed. When they actually saw something and they felt like. Somebody told me, looked me in the eye and says ''Well I can do something about that'' When I did go up to Stanford It was almost as if somebody turned on the light. It was very strange. And it's even stranger talking about it now. Because it was so palpable Cause you're awake during this procedure. And it was almost like as the blood started rushing into my brain. I felt like awake again And it was so wonderful. He's now out 6 or 7 years. And doing very well. But there wasn't just him. You started looking at other patients ? Well we started to examine patients. You know this community is a very tight-knit community of patients. And they are networked in a very tight way. So all of a sudden a number of patients were coming to us. Without any ... We were not sollicitng in any way. And we started looking at patients. And we found a very high preponderance of patients with similar vineous narrowings. And we started treating patients. And we saw very interesting results. So how many patients did you treat ? It was a long time ago. Now we have not been really treating patients. For 3 or 4 years now. But with MS I think we probably treated. Approximately 59 patients. And they all had narrowing in the vein ? Not every single one. I think there were 2 patients that we did not treat. Because they did not have what we felt was significant narrowing And where is it today ? What's happened ? Well right now I think at least the interventional treatment of CCSVI. Has basically gone to zero. So why did you stop ? Well the pressure I think from all sorts of various special interest groups. Has sort of conspired to stop everything. At least in our country. And I'm sure in Canada as well. I'm well known under a certain speciality. Not neurology. Certainly not even MS. I was doing this cause we were very interested. And thought this was terribly exciting. But I had many people come up to me at national and international meetings. They're just ''Watch yourself''. ''Watch yourself. You don't want your career destroyed by this''. You know you don't want your reputation which is so good to get. Sullied by associating with this sort of stuff. They thought it was a complete hogwash. They thought it was obviously. Did not have any basis scientifically. And unfortunately therefore we couldn't get funding to do the type of trials. That were necessary to legitimize it. I'm not going to bash anything to do with the pharmaceutical industry. But these drugs as they come out obviously are faily expensive. What we're talking about for treating - a current treatment for narrow veins. Are done by clinically undifferentiated price. A balloon is a balloon, is a balloon. That's a low budget item. And as such there is not a lot of money to be made by industry. As opposed to pharmaceutical latest greatest new drug. It'll get there. And all of this is good stuff you know. it's just not in the timeframe with that accelerated tempo we might like. Like I said it will take another generation. You know I came in here and my expectation was that we have the answers. I just can't get them out there. No. That's not the case. Like we don't have answers. We have some theories. And to treat it. That's gonna be a long time. Now are they chasing at a different way than the current pharmaceutical and neurologists ? Yes Do I think it's more hopeful on the long run ? Yes I do believe that. But I don't have time. I don't have time. And neither do anyone else with MS. So it's like from now on. From the doc. Like fuck it man. Like going back. The time with the doctors. All we hear the same kind of thing. What we gotta do is tell the story of get out there And start doing different therapies. That may have a positive effect on you. Cause you gotta try to stop it now. Cause if you wait, just sit back and hope that science is gonna catch up. That the doctors are gonna catch up. You're gonna die man. Matt come on in. (indistinct) Well MS is a disease that affects thousands of canadians. In fact some of the highest rates are here in Saskatchewan Matt Embry is one of those people who suffers from MS. Matt from Calgary. And he's embarked on a speaking tour. To share his story on how he's treating the disease. Matt thank you so much for joining us today Yeah thank you so much for having me. It's great to be here. You're talking about how you're treating the disease It's been 20 years since you were diagnosed with MS. Tell us a little bit about how you're coping. Right, so in 1995 I was 19 years old I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Well this is 20 years ago so, I'm having a little hard time remembering exact ... You know but I remember saying "okay, what is this ?" All of a sudden I get a phone call. From my brother that he's been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. And I mean I literally almost clapped. I mean I couldn't believe it. So bizarre to have this feeling that, you know, my older athletic brother. Was fairly quickly going to degenerate and be on a wheelchair. Well it's definitely tough. You have like a cloud come over the entire house. There is a pretty crashing stigmatism around it. That just ... You have MS and you're done, right. I was a nurse before, so it had a huge influence on my image of MS. It was absolutely terrifying. Sorry ... Sorry ... You Don't want that for anybody. I was sure they should have drugs, and they should have a way of dealing with this. And when the doctor said no, there is no drugs. There is nothing we can do. So immediately your mind starts saying ''Okay, I have to try and figure out what the heck is going on'' He more just dugged right into the science. We'd largely hit the ground running, where his office just became stacks of papers. And there's something new everyday in terms of the reaserch and what to do. And my brother is an astounding guy. Like he's PHD in geology. but I mean he's one of the great reaserchers. And he just peepers in on that subject of great interest to him. And obviously this was of tremendous interest to him. because of his son's issue. So he went to work and reaserched every aspect of this. And he settled on diet. Science isn't all. And to me you gotta have hard science. That's it. In terms of the illness. Well, you want to treat cause. And I thought with the dietary therapy we were treating cause. He basically got Matt on a very rigorous diet. As I sometimes joke with Matt that the diet is worse than the disease. But it worked. There has been months where we sort of ate oil, chicken or fish. And that was it. And vegetables. It was really cut down to nothing. And sort of built it back up. If they had had a drug that was ''Okay, take this drug then you'll be absolutely fine for sure'' Then we probably would have gone on it. I'm a believer in drugs that actually are effective. When he was diagnosed, he had a very serious case. As a result of what he's done subsequently, it's worked fantastically. I mean look at him, the guy looks like an all-star. And he's been afflicted with it for more than 20 years. And then after I've done my research at the start. And I've put it all in a paper. And I decided I should give it to the MS society of Canada. And say ''Look I found this information''. And I wondered if they'd be interested in distributing it to their members. And I was very surprised when they just were not interested at all. Why ... Why wouldn't they want this information ? That was my first tinkling that something was not good. Well MS is this mysterious entity. And I think that there hasn't been progress. In terms of knowledge about the cause or the cure. Since basically the diagnosis was created by Charcot. Back in mid-19th century. So it's up to MS society to march for hope. The MS society of Canada was once a highly reputable, respectable organization. That really, fundamentally was there for the patient's interests. And I've been very disappointed in their lack of activism of these issues. What I do know is MS society collects a lot of money. It's in the tens of billions of dollars that the MS society raises a year. They were very happy to be seen as having a greater bottom line of income. But no one got too woried about the fact that the money. Was actually coming from the pharmaceutical industry. So the international federation of MS societies. you know, like more than 30% of their income. Comes from the pharmaceutical industry. They don't talk about it. You try to get it from their annual report, you'll have to walk your way out. At least you used to. And then suddenly you got relationships. Between the charities and people from the pharmaceutical industry. All of which, by the way, is behind the scenes. The drug idustry and its relationship with the MS society. Makes it adventitious for the MS society to go along. That path of talking about drugs. of speaking hopefully about drugs. Then, the pressure that should be there. From a fair-minded, charity person. To pressure the whole situation. In the direction of finding something that really makes a difference in the long run. Starts to lessen. And it's all very subtle. So when they start to badger the pharmaceutical industry. Then the money that they used to give for MS chapters. To have their coffee meetings. Sometimes dries up. Sometimes the big donations influence might go on. Drug companies have a conflict of interests. They wanna run their business. They wanna sell their drugs. And they need somebody to promote it. The MS society is a good vehicule to do that through. Just at the end of 1999, I figured out vitamine D was a major factor. I remember the first half of 2000. Trying to get the MS society to tell their members something about vitamine D. Time and time again, over the years we've heared vitamine D referred to as "the sunshine vitamine". A Calgary father, so convinced of its benefits. He is giving doses of vitamine D to his son. Who suffers from MS. When Matthew Embry was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. It launched the geologist on a search. A search for a cause. Ashton Embry noticed a link. People in northern countries like Canada have much higher rates of MS. They also get less sunlight and the nutrient that comes from it: Vitamine D. It's totally safe, they have nothing to lose. And they were just adament. They were not gonna tell anybody about vitamine D. That was it. That was the final blow for me. Of trying to be involved with the MS society of Canada. Of trying to cooperate, of trying to do things with them. I don't think there is anyone there that is actually pushing any useful agenda. And they abbregated their responsibility for being a kind of a buffer. Between the pharmaceutical industry and the patient population a very long time ago. Well it was Joan who decided we've got all this information. We should get it to other people. The charity was my silly thing of you know ... We can waste money and get the information out there. Get the research done on vitamine D. And those kinds of issues that the MS society wasn't doing. And we, as families with the disease. We need to have those answers. This is now 1996. And the big change was the internet. Where you thought you should have more information available from people. Besides from your doctor. And so you're able to get things out. And so okey, let's make a website ! So that basically was the start of it. My wife has MS. on the day I found out, the first thing we did was went on the internet. To search for answers. One website that helped greatly was direct-MS. Because we're looking for some solutions now. Not wait for a drug or see a neurologist. I called up to Ashton Embry and went for lunch. And met some of the other board members. And my wife decided to go on a diet right away. And to this date it's been the right decision. When ever I run to anybody that has a friend or a relative. Or somebody they know in the early stages of MS. I say you gotta get on my brother's website. And find out all this stuff you're not gonna get through normal channels. I mean it's really been helping people all over the world. I was very impressed when he gets these emails from all over the place. Complementing that it was helping them tremendously. I'm a scientist. Everything I do and eveything I tell anybody to do has to be backed by science. And this is information you're not gonna get from your neurologist or any MS society. We did hold a talk back about 18 months ago. And we didn't get much turn up. I think Matt felt bad about that. That night is the first time he seemed to start talking about ... ''Okay we gotta do something''. And his only knowledge of MS up to that was he sat at ... What is our goal then ? Our goal is to get the diet and the high dose vitamine D to the planet. We have to hit those first guys who were diagnosed. That are just being swarmed on. Because they want them on the drugs. You get that guy on the drug, he's on that drug for 40 years. - Yeah. 50.000 a year is worth 2 Million $ to them. Each guy. That's why we're here. Because they're gonna have the biggest benefit. I mean you go on a vitamine D, you go on a diet the day you get diagnosed. A lot of your progressing is extremely low. But if you don't do it for 10 years until you got a lot of problems. Well that's you know, it's gonna be a war of trying to ... That woman there wants hope. My dad has created the diet, he's created the program. He's done all the research to understand what it's gonna take. For people to get healthy. And how to stop the disease. So the only purpose in doing any of this. Is to get the message out that this is the way. I'm Matt Embry and I have Multiple sclerosis. Which is a series of videos and PDFs. That give people with MS, newly diagnosed or already living with the disease. Kind of a road map to what I did to stay healthy for more than 20 years. MSHope is Matthew's vision because, I think, of his career. He knows how information should get out to the public. So by taking the information that's on the Other site and what his dad kinda researched. And finding new easy ways to follow for that. Is a real gift to people who have just been diagnosed. I'm not gonna preach in people's face. But all this is, this is what I did. Here is the road map, here is the equation. Created the website, tried to reach the masses. You know, I tried my best. And if that's not good enough. It's not good enough. A Caligary man diagnosed with MS is speaking out. To share how he has been laregly symptom-free since diagnosed in 1995. If I can get out there and spread the message. And even change one or two people's lifes. Then that's what I've gotta do. He's sharing how diet, exercice, and vitamine D. has kept his symptoms at bay. He also had a procedure to increase blood flow from his brain. That's right, I've had the CCSVI procedure a few years ago. We're not gonna say it's the magic bullet. And we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Lifestyle has worked so well. That he and his father are now setting out. On a free speaking tour. My goal in doing the speaking tour across Canada. And over to london, and into the United States. Is to create as much awareness as I possibly can ... You know this is quite a change. From what we've done in the past. Cause as a family we tend to be quite private. I don't even know if all our friends knew. Before all of this recent publicity came about. That he even had MS in his past. So this is quite a shift for the best. And it's not something I'm necesseraly comfortable with. But I'm happy to support behind the scenes. What's that ? - MS Hope. MS Hope ? That's right. When he'd launched MS Hope, we did have some concerns. That some of the institutions and bigger societies. Would have an issue. Because it is drug-free. It is anti-medical establishment. Could they sue him, could they go after his business ? Could they go after us, our credibility ? what could they do to us ? I am holding a letter that was sent to me. From the Multiple Sclerosis society of Canada. Threatening me with a potential lawsuit. Accusing me of an infringement of the Multiple Sclerosis society of Canada Trademark. Furthermore they have the right. To seek temporary and permanent injunctions. As well as damages. When I started writing about alternative ways. Of dealing with MS, of managing MS. This is way back in the 1970's. I came up against the MS society of Canada. And they were beyond abusive. I mean beyond abusive. They threatened me with all kinds of things. Had I not been a member of the medical community They would have had me struggle. For me there was no doubt about it. They were in for blood. I have to admit I was a little surprised When he got a ''cease and desist'' For a website that isn't trying to make money. Please respond via email within 7 calendar days. Indicating your intention to cease and desist. The use of MS mark, or confusingly similar trademark. We hope that this issue may be resolved this way. So we can avoid further legal remedies. which blew my mind again. I think why wouldn't the MS society be really excited about. Here is a good website. That might be of real value and help people with MS. Well it's difficult enough. Fighting off the effects of multiple sclerosis. Now, a Calgari man is finding himself in a battle. With the MS society of Canada. Matt Embry says diet, exercice, And a controversial medical procedure. Has allowed him to stop taking. The usual MS medication He wants to share his story with the world. Through a website. The problem is, the MS society says. His logo is too similar to its own. He has since received a letter from lawyers. And has taken the site down. Until further changes are made. They're focused on the wrong thing man. You got a great website. a great responsible website. Seeking out help for people like myself. We're gonna have to change the logo. And the color scheme up top, and the header. We're gonna go through some of this content. And change that as well. Your video sildes are gonna have to change. As well as the PDFs. And then we're gonna have to put this disclaimer. That they're asking for. It's a pretty aggressive letter. They're going to sue somebody. For ... a logo. Instead of curing my disease ? So you know, I think you gotta stand up to them. They're bullies. What happens is that they want to rubbish you. And they do a very good job of it, I have to say. They've got their Goliath. They have power of money on their side. And they have magazines, and influence. And so on. And you're just an individual person with MS. I may make the assumption it's resurfaced things for Matthew. Matthew's living with the disease. And he's living with the fear. And to think of it coming back. So, I think that ... This has again resurfaced that. And because he's now dealing with this new MSHope site. That's a lot of pressure on him too right now. Well it's like I have two options, right ? I could just stop this whole thing. And that's crossed my mind. I don't need to be sued by the MS society. I don't need to put up this stupid website. I don't need this. Right ? -No. Clair came home. She's like. Telling me about how her friends at school. Have seen the videos and stuff. -Mmm. This would happen in like 10 years from now, right ? Mmm. I think that was my biggest fear going into this thing. My biggest fear has been since my kid was born. It's like I have lost control of this thing again. The first time I feel like. The disease took my body. This time I feel like it's taking my reputation My kids see me ... Right? Truthfully, for me I know that sucks. I have to constantly put that kid. That 19 years old kid who gets diagnosed. Like ... 15 years out in front of me. There is nothing stopping you from pulling the plug. If you want to. -Mmm. I agree. Is that what you want to do ? Do you roll ? Rolling in. A free resource of information, for people affected by MS. I've created this new video. To adress what I believe. The MS society of Canada needs major change. To better help people, like me, and others. With multiple sclerosis. I do not believe people give to the MS society of Canada. To hire expensive lawyers. To threaten people with MS. How am I doing ? -Good. It's okay ? You got rushed ... It's okay, we'll do another take right. This is the MS society of Canada. This is a society that was created for people with MS. To defend us. To represent us. And to find us a cure. And given that only 16% of their revenues, Are spent on researching a cure for MS. I question who this society is truly for. A Caligari man diagnosed with MS, Is speaking out tonight. He's accusing the MS socirty of Canada, Of not doing enough to fight the disease. He posted a video on his website, Pointing a finger at the MS society of Canada's practices Embry says from 2010 to 2013, Of the 211 Million in revenue, The MS society of Canada, Spent just 32 Million on research. Only 16 cents of every dollar donated. Well in the first half of the hour. Of course I was talking with Matt Embry. And, he was talking about how he has dealt. With his MS. And I have received a number of texts and emails. Thank you very much. But also, Matt Embry was very critical of the MS society. And where the dollars go. So, I have invited Darrel Gregory He's the director of MS society of Caligari. To join me. To give me a little bit of details here. Hello Darrel. -Hello Angela. Is Matt Embry correct when he looked at the kind of revenue ... And found that 16% of every dollar. That's all that has gone to research. Well no he's not correct actually. Matt paints an incomplete picture. Of our research investment. And our fund-raising. It doesn't take into consideration. The research funding that we ... invest through the multiple sclerosis scientific research foundation. So what percentage then with those new figures, Would be going towards research ? Good question. Good ... I don't have an actual percentage Angela. I could get that for you. But I just don't have it with me. -Right. But I can tell you for example. If we break it down to Calgary. If we wanna talk about salaries as well. In last year in Calgary, our chapter contributed 585.000 dollars to research. So what was that a percentage of your overall budget ? Our budget in 2014 was about ... Well to tell you the truth Angela, I don't ... I'd have to dig that up. I don't have our budget for 2014 right in front of me. We know ! It's unfortunate Darrel, because ... I think you knew I was going to talk to you about. His criticism about where the money goes. And not enough goes to research. So I don't mean to put you on the spot But I thought you had those numbers. I do have the overall numbers for research and services. But I don't have the overall budget ... How much goes to actual salaries and programs. Yeah it's unfortunate because my producer knew ... This is what I wanted to ask him. So he just had the researching numbers. And I would like to get more than that. Why do you say "Well, it's research" "But we're giving it to another foundation" That's when people become very cynical. Of big charitable organizations. I'll throw it out there again on 7:30 tonight. Free conference, Coast Plaza hotel. Or you can call a number. And don't worry about writing it down. Just go to world web page ... And so it was a big comittement for you to do this. And then you started to wonder will the MS society supposed to be there to support me ? Have you ever had the opportunity to speak with them ? And have them say to you why they don't support that ? Or why they don't ... -No. They don't want to talk to you ? Okey. -No. And this has always been the biggest question, I think. I'm always curious why they haven't called me. To understand why someone with MS is doing so well and getting vocal. Anybody who is still mingling. We're gonna give you a moment here to settle. I'm sure a lot of people in this room are familiar with Ashton Embry and Matt Embry. And the work they've done for 20 years. I think though this is the first time they really kind of come together. To share their story. If you know anything about their story, you know it's a very powerful story. And hopefully an inspirational story. Matt's gonna speak first. And then his dad is gonna follow up. With some of the science behind what they've developed over the years. And what they hope works for others. And so maybe we can just ask them questions after both people speak please. Hello everybody. I am so thankful for absolutely everyone for so much of the support that has come to me. Tonight is about hope. Tonight is about learning about strategies. It's about changing your lifestyle. And you making the decisions. So this being the opening night is very, very special. But I'm not gonna cry. I'm only gonna laugh. And we'e gonna have a good time tonight. And we're gonna get some MS hope on board. Alright ? So I'm gonna talk about important strategies to help keep MS under control. This is information you're not gonna get from your neurologists. And your friendly MS society. I was diagnosed 12 years ago And my doctor said that I will be in a wheelchair in 5 years. If I didn't start on the drug therapy. I changed my diet. I found it was recommended () diet, so I went and researched it. And I've been doing lots of googling ever since and found all sorts of things. When I bring this up to my physical therapist, or my neurologist. I was met with some dissatifactory answers. I fired 4 neurologists because they all tell me to eat from the 4 food groups. People in my community between the age of 30 and 50, we are in wheelchairs. We oblige, we are in nursing homes. And that's not me. We've got almost to have a protest. I don't know. I don't know how ... You know what, that's a good question. I will post in the next 2 days on my facebook who you have to write. 2 days. Good idea. So thank you very much for coming, and for supporting us for all the years. We hope that this really was some great information for you. And wish you all the best. You have to show people, to convince people with MS, to do it. You have to show people, who are one the dot like you. Who are the picture of good health. You just have to say, this is what you could be like. You could be brooming with good health. And having a happy marriage, and family, and worklife. And everything you hoped to get out of life. But you could stick to it. Because if you don't, you do not want to see yourself go down that road. So mostly my diet consists of fresh foods, fresh vegetables, lean meats, and fish. I was diagnosed just at the end of march this past year. I had CCSVI. I've been symptom-free for 11 years now. If you get adequate vitamine D from birth onward. And maintain a good vitamine D. The chances of getting MS are almost zero. " You did great last night Matt and Ashton Embry '' " After several attempts to get onto the diet, I'm ready to do it now '' " I've been inspired, thank you guys '' Somebody just posted that right now. I have so many so many stories in my inbox. 15 years of remission on the diet. 20 years, no drugs. The people on the drugs I think tonight as a team, everybody. We have to focus on finding secondary stories. This is about different people who need hope. Totally different tone that way. I got Multiple Sclerosis for the last 35 years. I never took any medication. I just dealt with diet all my life. So I've been vigilent and here we. are It's been 15 years since diagnosis ... Everything has got to go. Milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, everything. All foods that contain gluten ... I feel so much better. It's been 3 years now just gluten free. By controlling your physical being, exercising. By controlling what you put in your mouth. Now you're in control of the disease. I'm just a guy who's diagnosed with MS. And has implemented different types of strategies. That have worked for me and have worked for hundreds of people around the planet. This has truly become a global issue in a global conversation. Hi Owen, it's Matt Embry calling around I believe 11:30 your time. I'm just calling to invite you to a speaking engagement I'm gonna have in Toronto. On september 29th. It's at 7:30 at the Westin Prince hotel, 900 York Mills road. And I really hope you can make it and learn about my story of hope. Thanks Owen have a great day. So do you enjoy it more now that you're out here ? Oh yeah. Absolutely. I built this whole thing right to the road. Really ? By myself. Took me quite a lot of time but there are some nice sunflowers here. So what I tried to do, some people have noticed it. It's got a slightly different construction. I was trying to make the post kind of like one of those ''Inuksuk'' things. -Alright, right. That's the idea of this. -Yeah, I can see it. For me one of the chronic dilemmas. Has been how much to say and when. I know lots of things. That you'd have to take some anti-nauseants after. Because it's so distasteful. How much higher can the stakes be than this ? It's billions and billions of dollars. And yet the system is set up in such a way that it can be corrupted easily. It's child's play to corrupt the system now. Nobody is standing up and saying what they should have said. That's good. I watched this whole story from the very beginning. I was one of the investigators that were contacted at the very beginning. When the interferon trial was planned in 1986/87. And I was the principal investigator of the Serono study with Rebif. I basically wrote the paper for the first interferon study. And I felt out of sync with things. When I couldn't get the pharmaceutical industry to do the studies that were really needed. Which is looking at the long term outcomes. Where you reached a point where something really important was happening. Like the developement of progressive disease. We couldn't get them to do it. I mean I can tell you a couple of them told me frankly. Like why would we do this ? We're selling lots of drug. We're making lots of money. Doing that study can only be bad for us. If it shows that it does work. Then we'd be right where we are right now. If we show that it doesn't work. We've lost the whole ball game. People accuse me of being against pharmaceuticals. But this is not true. If there was a drug that can demonstrate to significantly slow long term progression. I would probably take it, but I haven't seen it. There is almost no evidence that any of these drugs make a difference on the long term. What they do very cleverly, is leave the impression that it's gonna make a difference in the long run. Without actually saying so. That's where the controversy began. Because when pressure was put on them 20, 25 years ago. To carry out studies and make them longer and reach harder outcomes. Let's say, time to needing a cane to walk. The food and drug administration. Were they only ones who had the power to enforce this. All they had to do was say ''Okay, you don't get the long term outcome'' ''No approval'' And there is nothing more motivating for a pharmaceutical company. Than to tell them they're gonna have their licence for the drug jurked, if they don't comply. They never did it. I'm not happy, and you shouldn't be happy, and patients shouldn't be happy. I wonder why MS patients are injecting or swollowing MS drugs. That may cause serious side effects, or even death. But have not been proven to be effective in the long run. It's hard for patients to ask those questions. It's where the physician is intended for the most part, to step in. And if the physician is already compromised. Because they're on some major drug company kind of income stream. It sacrificies or impairs our ability to do this well. In the United States for example, on a New York Times article a few years ago. About how many physicians have a financial relationship with the phamaceutical industry. It was over 90% in the United States. Over 90%. And why do tax payers around the globe pay billions of dollars for MS drugs. That have been demonstrated to have no long term effect ? You follow the money. You always followe the money. And you find out that somebody who is being relied upon to deliver an objective assessment. Of whether or not this drug is showing a useful effect, is also on the take. In a big way. From the institution that stands to gain the most from there being a positive effect. IE the pharmaceutical company. Right ? Here are the side effects. Back pain, blood in the urine, burning or stinging of the skin, continuous uncontrolled back and forth or rolling eye movements, Decreased sexual desire, difficulty with moving, ear pain, fast breathing, irritation of the mouth nad tongue, loss of appetite, Menstraul pain or changes, muscle pain, painful cold sores or blisters on the lips, nose, eyes, or genitals, Sensation of motion usually whirling either oneself, or one's surroundings, speech problems, vision problems, So that's Copaxone. It's unbelievable. And then there is the other one. What are you looking at ? That's bad man. So what if these didn't work ? Here is Interferon. Headache, increased sweating, lack or loss of strength, nausea, sore throat, stuffy or runny nose, Unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, double vision, seeing double waking ... No let's just stop it, it's too depressing man. It's making me think. I think as far as treatment of these very expensive medications go. They do have potentially serious side effects. I know that I wouldn't be taking it myself. I wouldn't be taking it. I rather take my chances with the natural course of events. Rather than introduce something else, which is the risk of who knows what. And the newer and recent the drug is, the bigger who knows what is, right ? Because there is not enough information. So I think you're perfectly defensible in not taking anything. The MS society of Canada, they have never, ever, stuck their oar into this controversy. Except, if anything, to kind of diffuse it. You never heared from the society that. These outcomes were being missed. And you should be hearing from the society, right ? Or they should at the very least be supporting people. Who are prepared to stand up and say this. Is anyone from the MS society of Canada here ? Anybody ? No, No. There is health at stake. There is the interests of poor vulnerable people. And there is a huge amount of money at stake. I remember saying from this guy at the FDA. Someone shoots you dead for a parking space, what will they do for a billion ? And the answer is, plenty. For now we have to be giving people hard information. People didn't like listening about the MS society of Canada. People didn't like it about the sponsorship. And now they're like, yo maybe you don't like what's going on with your life too right ? That's a different view for someone with MS. And I don't know how they're gonna react. Are they gonna be angry as hell at me ? Or are they gonna turn on the societies and the drug companies ? I hope it doesn't come to me, and it could come to me. The number of MS-ers on wheelchairs, walkers and canes. Has not declined. So what is going on here ? Because I am not seeing any convincing scientific evidence. That any drug has a notable effect on the long term progression of Multiple Sclerosis. We did it man. They're not gonna let you keep saying what you're saying. While they're trying to squash you. If you're right and you show them that you're right. And you show the world that there is other ways of taking care of this. Without medications, and this whole thing has been smoking mirrors all these years. You're an enemy. I mean that's just how it is. You know when arnold schwarzenegger gave me this lifetime achievement award. You know, that was the exclamation point for me. It showed me that the fitness world is listening. And all of these young guys that are healthy are looking to me. And saying if this guy can do it. At his age, with MS, we can do this and we're healthy. So, am I doing the right thing ? For me, yes. I'm the founder of the MS fitness challenge. Which is a charity to help people with MS nationwide. And soon worldwide. To get connected with trainers. And to be able to conquer the disease through fitness and health. I've got people with MS from the UK, from Canada, from Australia. From even places like Slovakia. That are saying "could you bring the MS fitness challenge here ?'' Well the MS society has branchs all over. Why aren't they embracing what we're doing ? To say "okay, we're doing research, you're doing fitness" "Let's merge so that we can help you to reach those people." No. Instead they're saying "You're competition." I mean, where is the heart to help people with MS. I don't take meds. But, I mean I'm not a doctor. So I don't tell anybody not to take meds. I mean that's stupid. You can't go around telling people don't take your medication. And just do what I'm doing. But all of this time, the symptoms are still there. This side is numb, like you could stab me in this arm. I don't feel it. This leg still drags. I get in and out of the leg press. I'd put a thousand pounds on a leg press and then crawl out. So I still have all the symptoms. And I eat unbelievably well. I mean I don't eat junk, I don't eat gluten. I eat really really clean. My symptoms have progressively gotten worse. - Right, right. And this in here is my stash. What is all this ? These are different types of proteins. That, you know, some are vegetable based. There is others that I take that are whey based. And that's what I eat everyday. I mean, this is what I take in addition to eating all my healthy foods. Right. Right. Can I ... Can I judge it right now ? They're working on one right now that has nothing artificial in it. I mean, without this stuff I couldn't get through my workouts. This stuff keeps me my energy level, gets me all the protein I need. Get's all my aminos in, the BCAAs. Without it. You know, I wouldn't be able to get through this. I wouldn't grow, you know. If you look at the protein, this one I think is plant based. Yeah. Yeah. It's got stevia in it. -Right. Right. Let's just cut for a second. Man, you got to get off this one. I'll show you how it changes your disease activity. Really ? -It increases it. How ? cause I take whey everyday. Don't ever touch it again. It poisons you. -Really ? The one food you can't have is any type of milk. I'll send you ... Any type of what ? Milk. - Dairy, anything. Whey. This starts the process. I'll send you the science. -Yeah send me some stuff like that. Yeah I wanna read about it. It's unblievable to me that we know this increases your disease activity. And nobody says anything. No. Tomorrow we're gonna meet Judy Graham. It's a big deal, she's a huge mentor. she's the godmother of MS diet. She's the first person who punched out the book on ... How diet can change your ways. And she's been connected to our family the whole ride up. And my dad wrote for a magazine that she put out for years. And ... Huge inspiration to me. If there is one person on the planet. who's been the inspiration for this whole thing, it's Judy. So the fact she's here, and the fact that we can actually meet her is amazing. So I just really hope she's okay, right. Cause how she is, is gonna be how I think I'm gonna end up. So, it's been 20 years man, since I've read her book. So I'm still good but I want her to be good too. Hi, hello. - Hi, how are you ? Oh you brought the camera running. Okay. The old trick. - Hi. nice to see you. Yeah so I created a website. That ... it's got 4 videos on it. That kinda tells people how the diet, exrcice ... And like downloadable pdfs. Oh boy you really are the next generation. It's so nice, it's a sort of a feeling of being a relay runner. And although I haven't handed any baton to you. It's feeling a bit like that. Because some of the things you're saying are sounding a little bit familiar. So I still feel that people like you and I are swimming against the tide. The tide is mainstream. The tide is ''give us the magic pill''. Let science solve this for us. And doing a whole lifestyle thing is bloody hard work. And how are you feeling ? Well I have got worse. But after 45 years, I should be dead and I'm not. I can't manage without some kind of mobility scooter. Or someone pushing me on a wheelchair. And I'm sorry that it's come to that. It's so easy to break the diet. It's so tempting to break the diet. Cause it's a hard diet. It's so tempting to be lazy and not do some exercice everyday. My own happy conclusion is that. MS deteriorates eventually. But I can't say that with certainty if somebody is very, very strict. Cause i haven't been very very strict. I wish I had, but I haven't. In my own case, I've gotten worse. But well enough to walk around. You're really hoping I wouldn't say that. That I've got worse. What have I said Matt ? Sorry. What have I said that's upset you ? Well I think you're probably right. You're right, right. That it will have the upper hand in the end. Probably not with you. I mean, I have been remiss. I have not been ... As strict as you are, as strict as I was. I've waivered. I've been very human. I've been, you know, a weak human being about this. And one part of me says ''stick to the diet !''. It's the eternal struggle that goes on ''stick to it, don't stick to it ...''. But you wouldn't cry just to see me now. I mean, I don't think if somebody newly diagnosed. Met me, coming up to 69. Diagnosed in 1974 but the symptoms go back to the 1960s. You wouldn't cry, or they wouldn't cry, if they saw me running around. In my flat leading a pretty normal life. You wouldn't, would you ? No ! Yeah, given my time again. I would be very strict. But in my own particular case with the human weakness, Of not sticking to it, I have gotten worse and I was. And I wish that wasn't the case. I would really love to be able to say to you, "If you do all of these things, it will just vanish into thin air'' And maybe that's true if you're very strict. Maybe that is true if you're very strict. For someone as young as you. I would say ''stick to it, stick to it, stick to it !" But you know maybe one needs the terror. Cause it's more than a scare, it's it ? It's terror, you know ? It is a terrrifying illness. And you see people who have lost it. And their voice has slowed and they can't pick things up. And all that. And in a way, You need the terror to keep you on the diet and exrcice regime. Because if it wasn't that bad why would you be motivated to do it ? It's the terror ''I don't wanna be like that !''. " I better do something about it now and stick to it ". My torso just can't hold me up. I can walk very short distances using two walking sticks. Otherwise, the inclined wheelchair. Cognitive problems coming next. Will I be having to face an early dementia ? I'm going downhill. Agressive treatement is not stopping that slide. This is an unpredictable disease. Functions once lost, are totally gone forever. Then in 2002, my Cleveland clinic neurologist, He said, I want you to check out this work by doctor Ashton Embry. He has a very interesting story, helping his son out with diet. And she emailed the web page to direct MS charity. It was his website that got me started my food journey. So we don't have quite as much kale as usual. But we've got some in here. Here we go. it's why we always come out every morning, take out a bunch of kale, And add it to our smoothies, or use it for cooked greens. So I got home, I read through all those papers. And I thought "well this is very interesting" So I went back to the internet, and started searching. And eventually, it took me a couple of months, I now had a list of foods that I should be stressing on my diet. So I had this list of foods which I now organized, Into the green sulphur color. And I started this December 26th 2007. The month after that, I'm driving my wheelchair over to the staffing office. I take a cane over, and I'm able to walk between exam rooms to see the patients. And I wasn't exhausted. And I also had to know that in that month. My brain fog was just melting away. The month after that, I don't even need the cane. 3 months later, I can walk even uphill without a cane. Hadn't done that in years. I don't really know what to think of all of this. I don't know if this is temporary, or if this is permanent But I know that recovery is not impossible, I'm walking around. And then, probably 3 weeks later, It was a very beautiful day and I wondered if I could bike again. Put on my helmet, lay the bike down, Step over it And I push off. I'm a little wobbly at first. And then ... Zack cheered. Seby cheered. Jackie's crying. And we peddled around the block. And that's when I know that nobody knows what might happen. This really is the miraculous moment when ... I realized that recovery is possible. And that if I stay on this path of diet and lifestyle. Who knows what happen in another 5 or 10 years. That I might get better, very close to normal, or not. But the prescription that it's only downhill. Is not correct. We're gonna hit a lot of people with this one. That's gonna be very good. - Yeah I think so. Creating health is about diet and lifestyle. It's not about drugs. It's about diet and lifestyle. That's what got us unhealthy. And it really is what can restore our health and vitality. *chattering* I think the most relevant thing for what we're doing is. What you said earlier ''build it and they will come'' And that's what we're trying to do with MShope. We're gonna build it. And the patients, and the supporters. And the people who actually wanna end this disease are gonna come.
