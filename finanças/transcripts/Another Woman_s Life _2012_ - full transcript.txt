I think, buying into Royal Investment Marketing is a good investment. Excuse me, Mr. Cornet, I'm not so sure. Go on. Why is it a good investment?

Will you bring Adam? - I Promise. When the divorce is final, we wont have the same name anymore. Nor will Adam and I. I'd prefer someone else to Adam. Excuse me? - Jeanne. Your jealousy is boundless. it's pathological. They grew up together. You will never separate them Not you, not anybody. For you, family perhaps less important. For us, they are essential. Even to become a good man, You can't deny your family. Not even cousins. I am proud of this family. You decided to leave. I'm sorry, believe me. You are free. Everything ok? I'm going to grow my hair, I think. - Good. Even if it is at 40 41. Less "business woman" but, I feel better.. with long hair. I loved Adam immediately. So proud to have given birth to that little guy. If we took pictures of his birth, I'd like to find them. He must have been adorable. I had a caesarean. I saw a scar on my belly I didn't have before. I never thought that I'd like motherhood. I don't know what happened? Didn't think it would happen to me I wish I had a neice. Would've loved that A sister or a brother. I don't know. Do I have any friends? I called Flo, but she didn't call back. My father finally died. I probably never told him I loved him And I have... Never helped my mother. Probably always had something better to do. I'll try to call her. I remember one thing... As soon as I saw you I was in love with you. I don't know if I said it, but I loved you since I saw you on the beach. I was there, I think. In my family we were never very warm... I certainly was not... But today I feel so bad. I want to hold you, but I don't know how. I don't know if London has a school for that. I'll let you know I was always good at exams. There is hope. I still have some time. Unless... tomorrow I wake up 10 years later again. I hope it doesn't get more difficult I'll end up exhausted. always having to walk uphill. I don't remember... I no longer know... ...the day, That I regret most, That I don't remember what I didn't experience.
