- Coronado Island is a little island paradise. It's just a mile or two from San Diego. It has that quintessential small town safe feel to it. - Coronado is the lowest crime area in all of San Diego county. The most common crime they have is bicycle theft. - Nothing bad ever happens in Coronado. - Detectives in Southern California are stumped by the discovery of a woman's body at her boyfriend's mansion. - 32-year-old Rebecca Zahau was found dead, hanging in the sprawling 27-room home of her 54-year-old boyfriend, pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai. - Her boyfriend's brother Adam found her naked, hanging from a balcony, her hands and feet tied together. - I preceded to turn the TV on, and here it is. My sister, completely nude in the yard. She was just left there like a piece of garbage. - The scene was pretty suspicious. - It was such an unusual and bizarre crime scene. She was found naked, hanging outside a balcony. Her hands tied behind her back. Her ankles tied together. With paint on her breast. She had a T-shirt stuffed in her mouth. There was a bizarre saying painted on the wall. The big question is, did she really commit suicide, or was she murdered? - Her death came just days after her boyfriend's 6-year-old son fell down the stairs and suffered fatal injuries while she was caring for them. - Two mysterious deaths in the same house, in the space of a few days. - A beautiful young woman is watching her billionaire boyfriend's young son. He ends up in a very tragic accident. Where have you ever heard of a case like this? - Did she commit suicide because she felt responsible for Max's death? Or was this a murder? - The answer is no. It was a suicide. - Since it was a suicide, they thought it was all wrapped up. But boy did it explode in their faces. - It was a complete shock. - It really caused a lot of outrage. - The bizarre nature of the crimes really seized the public's imagination. - There was so much talk. - People said, "How would she do that to herself? "Why would she do that to herself?" [overlapping news broadcasts] - I can't get her back. Our family can't get her back. But hopefully people will know that she didn't commit suicide. - I'm Loni Coombs, and I was a criminal prosecutor in Los Angeles County for 18 years. As a criminal prosecutor, I had a motto. Ever vigilant, never forget. I am their one shot to get their story told. I would always have a picture of the victim on the wall. And today, the picture I'm focusing on is Rebecca Zahau. I personally have been agonizing over this case ever since I heard about it. Ever since I heard that they declared it a suicide. I wanted to know what's really going on here. As a woman of color, I think there's so many assumptions that are made right off the bat by people in society. The caption for Rebecca was always "the beautiful Burmese girlfriend "of a multimillionaire business man "Jonah Shacknai." And then they would go on to talk about his business and all the millions that he had made. And she was the victim here. Rebecca, she was actually a very worldly person. She started out in Burma. Her father ended up being a political prisoner. And after he got out of prison, the family escaped to Germany. They lived there for ten years. She went to Austria to be educated. She went to college. She came over to this country. She was very focused on her career. She was a fitness buff. She was a career woman. She spoke six languages. You never heard any of that. It was just "the beautiful." And if she wasn't beautiful, they probably would've barely talked about her at all. I'm going to be working with Billy Jensen, who's an investigative journalist. And together, we're going to combine our strengths and we're gonna look at this case and we're gonna test what we can test and we're gonna talk to who we can talk to. What are the facts the police are looking at to say it's a suicide? We might be able to find things that they haven't seen. We might be able to point out things that, perhaps, were overlooked. And whatever we come up with, we're going to take to the sheriff's. - My name is Billy Jensen. I'm an investigative journalist and victims advocate. I've been writing about unsolved murders and missing persons for 20 years. And I also help police departments solve crimes using social media. The proudest moment in my career so far was probably my first homicide solve. And that was catching the person responsible for the death of Marques Gaines in Chicago, Illinois in 2016. Rebecca died in 2011, but there's still so many unanswered questions. There's so many strange things about this case. Like the fact that Rebecca's hands were tied behind her back and her feet were bound. You know, I don't think I would've looked into this crime if it wasn't with a prosecutor, like Loni. - When I heard that this woman was hanging naked from a balcony outside with her hands tied behind her back... her feet bound together, and a gag in her mouth. And they were saying that this was a suicide? A-are you kidding? There's just no way. I thought, at some point, they would figure it out and change their minds. - The natural inclination is to... Is to think that there is a crime here. - Yeah. - But we very well might come to the idea that this was a suicide. - I still think it's extremely unlikely. - There's three times as many suicides as there are homicides in America every year. Most of the time, it's what happened. The person did take their own life, and it's tragic. But there are sometimes when they didn't. Staging a homicide to look like a suicide is not a fairy tale. It's happened before. There are cases of people that have committed suicide where their hands were bound. - Mmm-hmm. - Because they don't wanna self-rescue. We've seen that before. Binding the feet is a little different. - Mmm-hmm. - That's one check mark in the "this might not be a suicide." - Yeah. - We also have another case, as well. We have Max's case. When you have this mansion... - Yeah. - And you have two deaths within... - Two days! - Two days. - In the same house. Are they connected? Are they not connected? To really wrap my head around Rebecca's death, I need to understand the days leading up to it. Two days before Rebecca was found dead, her boyfriend Jonah Shacknai's 6-year-old son Max had a fall in their home. And ended up comatose in the hospital. The Sheriff's Department determined that Rebecca felt such guilt for what happened to Max that she took her own life. But her family insists that she was murdered. And someone is even been found legally responsible for her death in a civil court. Adam Shacknai, who is Jonah Shacknai's brother. The entire Zahau family wants law enforcement to reopen the case and to redesignate it as a homicide. - Where do you wanna start? - Well, I always try and start with the victim's body in a case like this. Because there's a lot of evidence on the victim's body. It's literally her way of speaking and telling us what happened in those last moments of her life. So, I say we start there. - All right. This is what her hands looked like. - Look at those knots. - Can you even tie your hands behind your back like that? - This is complex. She has ropes down below around her hands. I mean, it probably... It goes around five times on this side. And then there's knots all throughout it. - Yeah. Now, if you take a look at her feet, it looks like whoever was doing this knew what they were doing in terms of tying something up. - And if I was going to kill myself in this manner, and I had this balcony to get over, why would you bind your feet? If your hands are already bound, you're trying to get over that balcony. This crime scene is so strange. - There's even more weird stuff going on inside. The first thing that they would have seen as they walked into the bedroom is this. What looks like a towel and blood stains. - And this was, uh, Rebecca's blood, correct? - Yes, this was Rebecca's blood. - Now, we do know that Rebecca was menstruating. So, some of this blood, you know, could have been that. - And you've got what we saw on the door. Was this a suicide note? Was this somethin' that somebody else wrote? "She saved him can you save her." What do you make of that? - Rebecca painted. So, she had the paint supplies but it's third person, so that would lead it to be somebody not Rebecca. Here's something I find interesting. This smaller knife, which had been 27 right there. Uh, they said that there was blood... Rebecca's blood... on the handle. Not just on a side. All the way around. On the front, the back, and the sides, and the end. It wasn't just wiped. It was penetrating something. That knife penetrated that source of blood. How did that blood get there? She didn't have a lot of cuts to the point where she was, you know, bleeding on her body. - Right. - Because we know she was on her period, that's indicative of a potential sexual assault. You know, the coroner assumed that there was no sexual assault here, 'cause there was no semen. But any penetration... - Right. - Constitutes a sexual assault. If there's a sexual assault, that is a huge flag against suicide. - I don't know about you, but if I saw someone hanging, bound, naked, with a gag in her mouth, I would've thought murder. - The long drop execution-style hanging was meant to be a humane form of execution. Looking at her injuries, I am just not seeing this as being consistent with somebody who was dropped ten feet and then boom. - We have to look past the unusual appearance of the death and focus on the facts and the evidence. Our office concluded that the cause of death was hanging, and the manner of death is suicide. - Was it a crime? What do we think happened? What are the theories that could've happened? - Okay. - Let's lay 'em all out. - Okay, okay. Let's start with the one that the police say it is- suicide. Okay. - Okay? - But I have a gut reaction that it's- it's not a suicide. - You and everybody on the internet has a gut reaction that this is not a suicide. - Yeah. - Second would be that she was murdered, and it was staged to look like a suicide. - Okay. Murder. Staged. Okay. Let's look at the people who were in Rebecca's life at the time of her death. The person closest to her was her boyfriend, Jonah Shacknai. And Rebecca and Jonah had been dating for a couple of years and living together. And so, they were staying at the Spreckels Mansion there on Coronado together for the summertime. He had a son named Max, who was 6-years-old, who Rebecca was very close to. And he was in a coma in the hospital at the time of Rebecca's death. - Then we have Max's mother, Dina Shacknai. Dina Shacknai is Jonah's second ex-wife. She and Jonah shared custody of Max. And obviously she wasn't living in the house, but she was living just around the corner. - Dina has somewhat of a tumultuous relationship with Rebecca. There might have been some jealousy over the fact that Rebecca was Jonah's girlfriend and that she had a close relationship with Max. Now, when Max had her accident, Dina's twin sister Nina immediately flew in to San Diego for support. And Jonah has a brother named Adam Shacknai. And Adam is a tugboat operator in Memphis, Tennessee. After Max fell, Adam also flew in to be there for his brother Jonah. - Adam was staying in the guest house of Spreckels Mansion. And he was the last person to see her alive. And was the one that found her body in the morning. - And from Rebecca's family, we have her 13-year-old sister Xena. - She was visiting Rebecca on summer break. And she was the only other person home on the day of Max's accident. - Rebecca sent Xena home to Missouri so she could focus on supporting Jonah while he was going through everything with Max in the hospital. And lastly, we have Rebecca's older sister Mary. They were very close. Had a lot of communication with each other just before Rebecca's death. Mary's working very hard to have Rebecca's case reclassified as a homicide. - If we're gonna get any closer to figure out what happened, we gotta figure out who Rebecca was, as best we can. - I've actually been able to contact Mary. - Great. - So, she is going to, um, meet with us this afternoon, she said. - Sounds like a plan. - Hi, Mary. - Hey. - Hey, how are you? Mary adamantly disagrees with the sheriff's ruling of suicide. And I wanna know, what is it that she knows about Rebecca that leads her to believe there's no way that Rebecca would've taken her own life. - What was she like? How would you describe her? - I would say she was vibrant, compassionate, and definitely a go-getter. Rebecca and I, we grew up a Christian, you know. And our parents raised us to stay glued in our faith. And we grew up singing in the youth group, singing church hymns. And then later on, more popular rock type of music, but... She was funny. And she was charming. And she could make you laugh even on your worst day. I don't know how to say it. She just had this funny laugh. And just made me laugh because she laughed funny. Simple things like that, you don't think about until you miss it. - So, when Rebecca goes to, uh, Arizona, she meets a man. To come to America. To start going out with this incredibly rich guy. Like... Well, Rebecca's story was a Cinderella story. That would be see as a... As a... as a fairy tale. - Jonah Shacknai was and still is a pharmaceutical magnate. He made millions and millions of dollars by launching his own company. - Rebecca was working at a ophthalmology clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. Uh, Jonah came in... I believe for an eye exam... And he was immediately taken with her and they had been together nearly two years when she died. I don't believe that everybody in Jonah's life was totally kind and welcoming at first. I heard several people say she did not seem like the kind of woman that Jonah would be with. And I don't know what to read into that. Perhaps that she wasn't white? Perhaps that she was 20 years younger than him? - It was a little awkward, you know, when I first met him. And he definitely perceived that. I wasn't rude or anything, but I wasn't thrilled about it, you know. And it was one of those things where you wanna support your sister, she's an adult. - Why didn't you approve of it? - What is a guy with so much money doing with somebody like my sister, who is half his age? I know, deep down, that it was just not a good match. Why my sister? - What did you think he wanted? - To me, it felt like he saw a nice person... And my sister was... And took advantage of her. I mean, she was almost like a glorified nanny. I think he knows that she would take care of his kids, and she was more of a convenience, in all honesty. - Jonah had three kids. - Yes. - How did she get along with them? - Oh, boy, that's a long story. Um, I don't know all the details, but I do know that the teenagers were a challenge. But, she got along with Maxey really well. And we all call him "Maxey" because that's what she called him. She actually took the time to play with him. She would actually get down to his level and play games with him or read the books to him. She was very attached to him. - When did she contact you after Max's accident? - Um, it... the same day. Y-you can tell she was upset. But she wasn't hysterical or anything like that. But she was teary-eyed. I mean, I can tell in her voice. - So, the next day after the accident, you guys talked as well? - The next day was... I'm trying to think... Yes. - It was Tuesday. - Yes. - That was the day Xena was coming home. - Yes. And we had been talkin' about my dad's birthday, and he was gonna turn 80. And, um, I said, "You know, I think we should "throw a big birthday party for dad." And I told her that she could come home. She said "I will plan on coming. "Let mom know I will call her first thing in the morning, "'cause I have to get up at five "to make Jonah's breakfast." Thank you. And that was the last time that I talked to her. First thing in the morning, my husband came to work and he's like, "We need to go to your, um, office. "It's about your sister." He said, "Rebecca is dead." "They said she committed suicide." And I said, "What? No way." And I looked at my husband and I said, "We're going to San Diego "because somebody killed my sister." Did I think about the possibility of suicide? Yes, because when they first told me, they said she hung herself. She left us a note. I'm like, "I don't know, maybe she could've done it." Well, little did I know what the crime scene looked like. She tied herself in impossible manners, gagged herself. I mean, how she can finish what's she doing and then hop to the balcony? And you're tryin' to tell me that she committed suicide? It makes no sense. - Did they tell you about what was written on the door? - Honestly, I think that was just written to throw- throw people off. And as soon as I saw the handwriting, I told them, "That's not my sister's handwriting." But you know, it was almost like they had already made up their minds. So, whatever I said, they're like "Uh-huh." - The fact that Rebecca was naked. What does that tell you? - That piece alone makes me so angry and so upset. Because just the fact that her family would see her that way, she would have never done it. - What do you think happened? - My sister was murdered. And that gets me so heartbroken and hurt and angry. At the same time, that's my drive to keep going, because I still have to believe that the truth will prevail eventually. As long as I'm alive, I'm going to fight for it. - From the very beginning, law enforcement declared this to be a suicide. And it continued to hold to that ruling, even though people have questioned it all through the years. And Rebecca's family wants law enforcement to reopen the case. - I'll be the first to admit that this was a unique and unusual case. And I-I've personally investigated many suicides and homicides of various types. We have to look past the unusual appearance of the death and focus on the facts and the evidence. Our office concluded that the cause of death was hanging, and the manner of death is suicide. - The last outgoing call from Rebecca's phone was found to be to her own voicemail. Rebecca received news regarding Max's grave condition at about ten minutes to one in the morning. She made the decision to take her own life. She removed her clothing or was already unclothed, perhaps coming out of the shower. Painted the message on the door, cut the rope into sections, and secured the rope to the bed. She bound her feet, placed the rope and the shirt around her neck, fashioned her wrist bindings, and secured her hands behind her back. Rebecca moved out to the balcony, leaned forward over the railing, and fell. - Sean Elder is a skeptic of the Sheriff's Department ruling that this is a suicide. Sean is a journalist and an author. He wrote an article about these suspicious deaths at Spreckels Mansion for "Town and Country Magazine." He spent over two years investigating this case and talking to all of the people involved. So, he's gonna have a very interesting overview of this case. - You've been livin' with this case for a long time, haven't you? - Almost two years now, yeah. - What was the main thing that-that said, okay, this is not what it seems to be? - Just started with the basic facts of Rebecca's death. That she... her hands and feet with bound behind her. The San Diego Sheriffs, uh, they went to great lengths to convince people this could actually be done. That somebody could kill themselves that way. Somebody could tie this ra-rather complicated rather nautical knots. How would somebody slip them around, put them on their back, do the same thing with their feet, then put a gag in their mouth? Then you have to have her jumping off a little balcony. You just start to think, "This doesn't make any sense at all." What I found even stranger as I begin to dig deeper and as I begin to go back to the actual facts of the case as they were happening, that suicide determination started with the very first call. When Adam Shacknai called Jonah and said, "Um, I got some bad for ya, are you sitting down? "Um, Rebecca's killed herself." And, Jonah went into the hospital room where Max was and Dina was sitting and she said, "What's wrong?" She looked at him, she could tell something had happened. "So, what's wrong?" He said, "Rebecca killed herself." And she said, "Oh, my god. Why?" And he said, "Asian honor." And he made this gesture, sort of like, uh, seppuku, like a ritualistic suicide. This was repeated by some of the... Of the officers on the scene. I don't know about you, but if I was out here and I saw someone hanging from a balcony like that, bound, naked, with a gag in her mouth, the first thing I wouldn't think was, "Oh, that person must've hung themself." I would've thought murder. I would've thought execution. I would've thought something ritualistic. And then if you add to that, the day of Rebecca's death, the police seized two computers from the Spreckels Mansion. They did a search of the internet search histories on both computers and found a number of links about porn, including anime porn and, uh, Asian bondage porn. And in a case like this, when you hear that an Asian woman has been tied up and killed, and then you then find that somebody was searching for, um, something related to Asians and bondage on the internet? It just makes people think that the two had something to do with each other. People say, "Oh, you're tryin' to cover that up? "Well, what's goin' on there?" I think the public latched on to it for a variety of reasons. The unusual nature of her death. Perhaps a fetishization of Asian woman. The fact that the police had not publicly at least, talked much about those ropes, which left a big void and causes people to speculate. And the fact that the knots seemed way too complicated for the job they were set out to do. I think it casts another, uh, aura of mystery around this case... That the police did not seem to follow up on this. It seemed to be rather glaring and obvious that there was a connection... Or a possible connection there. And yet, we heard nothing about them investigating it. The same black paint that was found that was painted in the message on the door, was found on her body, around her nipples and the inside of her thigh. To me, it seems like some kind of sexual humiliation. - Every time I'm thinking "There's no way she would do that," I go back to the physical evidence. And I said there wasn't DNA on the rope or any-any of those sorta things that you automatically go to that you would see in a wrongful conviction case, for instance. - Okay, there's no DNA and there's no fingerprints. That makes it simple, right? Why? That was a common room. Why would only her DNA be there? And why, for that matter, on the knife that Adam supposedly cut the rope with to cut her down, his fingerprints weren't even on it. How do you do that? So, there are things like that that just... They stink to me, you know? They stink on ice. - I have a problem with the crime scene being a murder scene because there's no foreign DNA. But Sean brought up an interesting point... The lack of any foreign DNA at the scene is a big question. But it's just one question in a thousand questions that are surrounding this case. - All right, where are we? As a former prosecutor, I know that having a seasoned investigator is crucial. So, we're teaming up with Paul Holes, who's a forensic investigator. He's gonna bring that perspective of being able to look at all of the trace evidence... The DNA, the prints, the blood... And really tell us how it all fits together in the big picture. - How ya doin', buddy? Good seeing you again. - Going good. I'm Paul Holes, I'm a retired cold case investigator. And I, with a small team, was able to identify Joseph DeAngelo as the Golden State Killer. I spent 24 years looking for him. I initially started out working as a forensic scientist, applying DNA technology. And then over the years, I have moved into the investigative realm. I am going to bring valuable insight as to whether or not Rebecca killed herself or somebody came in and murdered her. Why don't you go ahead and tell me where you're at? - A-as far as I'm concerned, from the very get-go, I said, "There's no way a woman is going to commit suicide "naked out in public like that." - The thing that bothers me most is the lack of physical evidence on the scene of anyone else. From footprints to DNA. - When it comes to leaving physical evidence, oftentimes, it's-it's going to be dependent on the types of interactions the offender has with the crime scene, with the victim, as well as what precautions that offender is taking. It is very variable, and that's where you can't necessarily draw conclusions by the absence of the evidence. - Mmm-hmm. - To say there was nobody else present or nobody else that was involved. What I wanna show you first, initially, is just a little bit about the crime scene. Look at this. Pathologist notes that this was a long-drop hanging. You have a body falling from that balcony ten feet and instantaneous deceleration, with the forces being applied to this victim's petite neck across the dimensions of the rope into her neck. These types of hangings are-are very rare. You don't see them in suicides. So, it's something that pathologists don't encounter frequently at all. You see those more in the countries where they use that type of hanging for executions. And that's where your experts are going to be to evaluate the types of injuries. - Yeah, this is Old West-type stuff. - Exactly. - This is not somebody hang themself in a closet. - Right. The long-drop execution-style hanging was meant to be a humane form of execution because the idea was is to snap the neck so the people would just immediately be k-killed. Versus sitting there struggling as they asphyxiated to death. That's where looking at her injuries, I am just not seeing this as being consistent with somebody who was dropped ten feet and then, boom. So, with this long-drop execution-style hanging, this is devastating to the neck. Oftentimes, it causes breakage of the vertebrae in the neck, or in... What's called internal decapitation, or even decapitation. The pathologist noted hyoid fracture. Noted cartilage fracture. Noted hemorrhage. That is much more consistent with manual strangulation. So, the hyoid bone... This is a-a floating bone in the neck that oftentimes is diagnostic for manual strangulation. Because it floats, when you have a narrow thing such as a ligature, it's able to move out of the way from the forces of the ligature being applied. But when have broad hands wrapping around the neck, the hyoid can't slip away, and that's when it get fractured. - At this point in the investigation, evidence is pointing both ways. But if Paul's right, it's gonna be way more likely that somebody strangled Rebecca and then used the hanging to sort of cover it up. - You get into the physicality of Rebecca trying to kill herself by tying her hands behind her back, by binding her ankles together using relatively complex binding around both the wrists and the ankles. And then now, she's having to, in essence, hop to the balcony and get herself up over the balcony in order to die. It becomes one of those circumstances that just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. - When they were trying to sell the idea that she committed suicide, the police did a video of a woman putting the bindings together to try to show how easy it is. - Yep. - Oh, this could be done. And I think you've got that on the computer. - I do. So, let's go head and-and roll that. - To do this, I would have to be watching a video of it as I did it, and even then, it would take me a long time. - Obviously, not an easy process. The person demonstrating the process... That is impressive. Highly skilled in terms of being able to go through all of those manipulations of the rope. However, is that what we're seeing with Rebecca? - I-I even see one thing right off the bat. She's using her dominant right hand to pull that... The tightness at the very end. Here, it's in the left hand. And she was right-handed, so. - Right. - That's a good point. - Now, when you have people who are involved, let's say in bondage, that's what they do. And so, they do become very practiced. Did Rebecca possess this skill set? - One thing you can't escape is that there were bondage elements to this case. The way that Rebecca was bound. There was bondage found on the computers and searches for bondage porn. If Rebecca was in to bondage, she very well might've had the experience to tie these knots herself. Or, if there was somebody else there, they knew that bondage lifestyle and were able to transfer those skills over to commit a murder. - Hey. - I'm Billy Jensen. - Billy, it's a pleasure. - Hi, I'm Loni Coombs. - This is the Shibari room. - Shibari is the Japanese form of bondage where someone is tied up in intricate knots and suspended. - Hi, Loni. - Hi, Fae. - We're meeting with experts to get a sense for whether those knots that were found on Rebecca line up with the knots from bondage in Shibari. Here's the situation that we've got right now. We have a case where a woman was found hanging. - Uh-huh. - And her feet and hands were bound. - Okay. - She was naked, and she was hanged from a balcony. We wanted to take a look at the knots and see what type of knots are done, ah, with Shibari, and whether the knots that we're seeing on her match up. Can I show you some pictures of how this woman was found? - Do you recognize any of those knots? Do any of them look... - Well, I can see that, you know, they tried to do some half hitches. It just looked like they were trying to wrap it any way they could to get this rope to lock down. - So, does this have any basis in Shibari at all? - That's not even remotely close to Shibari. That looks like maybe some sloppy Western work. Or like somebody had some boating skills once upon a time. And, you know, it almost looks like they were cleating a boat, but they had human limbs instead. - Hmm. - If this was something that somebody was gonna actually tie on themselves, you just have to do the figure eight. And the trick is going to be slip the hand out. And if we go behind here. Slip my had back in. - Let me try this here. Now, I put one around. - Mmm-hmm. - This is what you're saying? - And then you just start doing a figure eight wrap. - Yeah, flip it over. - There you go. - All right. All right, then I'm gonna... - Slip that behind. - Do this. - Grab your two rope ends and just keep pulling 'til you make it tight enough. - Yeah. - Is it tight? Can you pull your hands out of it? - I mean, it would probably take 15 seconds. Yeah, eventually I could do that. But if this was the last thing she did, if she had her feet bound, the noose around her neck, and then she finally did this, and then hopped over. It could've happened. It wasn't that much of a challenge, to be honest with you. It really wasn't. So, just looking at the knots, do you think she could've done it? - Just based on the ties themselves? - Yeah. - And stuff like that? I could be that she did it to herself. What I'm not seeing is a relation to, like, Shibari or kink or something like that. I don't see that part. - Rebecca's bindings don't appear to be related to bondage. But to me, this means that this suicide theory that we're looking into is still a reality. I mean, very much a reality. She could bind her feet and her hands. There wasn't anything fancy about those knots that were found on her feet, her hands, or even the noose. So, this didn't take any expert information or knowledge. She could've done it. - So, where are you at with this thing? - You know, I started out with my gut reaction that there was no way this was a suicide. It just didn't make sense at all to me, and I didn't think it was possible, honestly. But, then we look at the physical aspects of it. The fact that is it possible? Yes. Could it be done by one person? Yes. Could it have been done by her? Yes. All those things are yes. It's interesting because you started out as thinking this was more likely a suicide. - I did. - Okay. - The reason why I was at suicide was that there was no other DNA found at the scene. - Mmm-hmm. - But then I talked to Mary and that... Coupled with the strangeness of the crime scene and that knife that looks like it was involved in a sexual assault... Adding all that together, I was veering towards murder. But I wanted to see if she was potentially involved in a bondage lifestyle. I don't even care about that anymore because those weren't bondage knots, which we learned. - Right. - And they were pretty easy to do. - Yes. I still think it was strange, I just don't think it was difficult. - Yeah. But then the question is this, why is she naked? - Yeah. Does not make sense. - All right. If she's found hanging with her wrists bound behind her back. - Mm-hmm. - And her feet bound, but she's clothed? - Mmm-hmm. - At this point in time, would you say suicide? - Yeah. Actually, that-that would make a big difference to me. That would give me a lot more pause. Because then I think you would really have to say, "Okay, was this just that impulsive, "extreme behavior, "and that she was so overcome with grief "that she decided to do this." But the naked? I-I don't see anyone saying, "Oh, this is the best way. This is gonna be easy. "Lemme just take all my clothes off and do this." - I wanna know, did she do other things naked? Did she like to be nude a lot? - Well, e-even if she was, I'll just tell you from the female perspective, if you're on your period, you're not walking around naked! - All right. So, you're in the shower, you're thinking, "You know what? "I'm going to kill myself." Is she really going to get dressed to commit suicide? - Yes, because it's not somethin' you do quickly. She's gotta go outside to the garage to get the rope. She's gotta go down to the kitchen to get the knives. She's got to paint the sign. She's got to figure out how long the rope's gonna be, so she doesn't land on the ground. You're not gonna walk around naked that time all over the house and outside to the garage. - Yeah. It's so weird. - Yeah. - It's just so weird. - Yeah. - Child died. Distraught female. She's emotional. She just hung herself. - She was incredibly distraught, almost incoherent. But was she distraught enough to kill herself? - Suicide is one way to regain your family's sense of honor. But being naked, that is very shameful. So, i-it's a bit befuddling. - You think this was a suicide? - Yes. Rebecca hung herself. - It's not suicide. Someone did this to her. - The whole case had an appearance of a sexual crime from the beginning. - A lot of blood right there? - Have you ever seen a suicide note written in third person? - This is angry. This is black. This is dark. - There's a pattern print that looks like a leather glove. - 'Cause all these years, I and my family have been fighting just to prove that she was murdered. - We tried to get a meeting with the San Diego Sheriff's Department. They refused to meet with us. - Rebecca Zahau's manner of death was a suicide. - The Sheriff's Department thought that they were gonna convince us that it was a suicide and we were just gonna go away. - If Rebecca was murdered, who had the motivation to do it? Who would do such a degrading thing to this poor woman? - It's right in front of our eyes. - Sexual assault with a steak knife. That said murder. - Everything that you see here is very humiliating. And one of the important things about a lot of sex crimes that I have seen is that you want to punish them. - We found no evidence that would lead us to believe that Rebecca died at the hands of another. - I will not stop until the world knows the truth. - Did you do anything to Rebecca
