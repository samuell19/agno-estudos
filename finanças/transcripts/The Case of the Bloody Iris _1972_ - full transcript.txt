Hello? It's you. Come up, I'm waiting. 'Why Those Strange Drops of Blood on Jennifer's Body?' Good morning. My god! Mrs. Moss, do you know her? I don't think she lives here. Never seen her before. I'm sure of it. I've lived here for years and I know more or less everyone. Do you know her? No. I have to go. I have an audition for a show. If the police want to speak to me, my name's Mizar Kellington, I live in 81. There's a dead body in the lift! What do you think of this one? Black, but not too much. Yes, she's real pretty but what am I supposed to do with her? What do you need to sell beer? I don't know, a good brand and a thirsty audience. No, it has to be embraced by a naked woman. Jar, bottle, tankard, all here, between the tits. - But I sell apartments. - So what? On top of a jet, sitting on a fridge, spread out on the bonnet of a car. In her hand, a pineapple, a cup of coffee. Whatever, it doesn't matter. It takes naked women to sell products. There must be a swimming pool in your property portfolio. - Yes, of course. - Great, then you want the black one. That black girl is as hot as the South Seas. You talk to her, I'll photograph her. 100,000 will do. Will you hurry up? I'm dying of cold. Go ahead, but not straight away. - Who's he? - Must be a friend of Arthur's. Pretty. Them? Not bad, advertising. Keep the mixed-race one close, listen to an expert. I'll make you an award-winning flyer with that one, or I'll eat all my film. - Come on, have you finished? - Yes. Excuse me. - Okay? - Good, good. Ready? Let's get to work. Pose. Where the hell are you looking? Here, here. Pose. Well? Who wants to try tonight? A bit of courage, guys. Mizar's all yours. You know the rules, three minutes. And whoever can tame me will have me. Who wants to try? Aren't there any real men here, capable of taming a woman? Come on, show me what you're capable of. Three minutes and Mizar will be yours. I'm here, ready to be tamed, if I find a good master. Your masculinity is at stake, come forward, men. What? There really isn't anyone? You. Come here, handsome. I'm here, I'm waiting for you. You have three minutes. If you can do it, I'll be yours. - Scared? - I'll come, damn it! - But if I win I want to collect. - Sure, any way you like. Come on, let's begin. You have three minutes. Come on, prove yourself. Come here, handsome. Come on, try and tame Mizar. Take me. Come on. Stop! Wait! Your three minutes are up, no extra time. Let go of me! I'll smash your face in! Let go of me! Listen, I'd like to get to know her. Can I get an appointment for later? That's it, like that. Good. You know you like it. Beautiful. Stop. Don't move. Beautiful. Lovely. Squeeze it. Caress it. Hurt it. Not too much. Let yourself go. There, like that. Great. Lovely. Look at me. Don't move. Everyone has to want that mattress. To lie on it, with you. You caress them. You kiss them. Look at me. Adam. Don't move! What the hell are you doing? Do you feel sick? No, it's passed. With those lights in my eyes, I thought I saw... Sure, you're just tired. Throw in the towel, for the little he pays us. - You're only good at one thing. - What? - Sorry, I really can't. - Okay, let's call it a day. That's life. It's Saturday, I have a date. What a pain! Bye. What is it? Don't you like our flowers anymore? They're the symbol of our group. One thing made up of different people. Like this flower is made up of different petals. You are part of us, and us part of you, Jennifer. I'm part of the group, and the group is mine. You don't have any choice now, you belong to us. You belong to me, since the day I married you. No, Adam, it's over for good. Please leave me alone. The others aren't enough for me anymore since you left. What do you want from me? Love? Possession? Maybe even jealousy. No, Adam, I'm still the same person I was before. It's the only way to free yourself, believe me. You have to reduce yourself to a thing to be free. Something that can be taken by everyone, and is no one's slave. But I can't, Adam. I feel dirty. It's stronger than me. Don't you understand? I tried more than once but it's not for me. I can't go on lying to myself, I don't love you anymore. Now you're lying. Who are you with? Who is it? What does he do to you? Does he pay you? This will help you remember. You'll be like me again. You'll come back to me begging on your hands and knees. Come on, let's begin. You have three minutes. Come on, prove yourself. This isn't funny. Who are you? Untie me! Let me out! Help! Help! Inspector, can we drain the water? I need some shots of her dry. Of course. Well, doctor? She died five or six hours ago but I'll know exactly when after the autopsy. Yes, but don't tell me she couldn't swim, this already stinks enough. All we have so far are some mixed up fingerprints. - Rubber-soled shoes. - It's a start. Sure, in a city with two million inhabitants... who hasn't got a pair of rubber-soled shoes in their wardrobe? No, there's nothing wrong with the lights. Someone slipped some cardboard between the bulbs and the sockets. An ingenious technique. I also found this. - Great, you've outdone yourself. - What is it? A lead? No, it's a Jamaican stamp. The coronation six pence. Good. - Is it needed for the investigation? - The stamp? No, the Inspector needs it. He collects them, he's an expert. Well, kid, what happened? I was bringing her lunch, like I always do. A ready-made meal. I found the door open, so... Yes, yes. And you? Weren't you the one by the lift? Yes, that's me. I heard the boy scream, so... I'm always at home, alone. You won't believe the pension they give a war widow. No, but I know how much they give us and I'm already trembling. Believe me, two murders in twenty four hours is trouble for us. The newspapers say there's a crime every forty-three seconds. Is that what they say? Who'd have thought it? However, they're not all murders, and not all in the same building. The one in the lift was... How can I put it? A working girl. She lived on the same street at 106. Those buildings all look alike. She may also have had a pimp. The other one, the mixed-race girl, worked in a sort of brothel. One of those private clubs where they have to pay a membership fee. I know, The Private Club. It's a nice little place. I know the owner. There isn't much he wouldn't do for money. What does the autopsy say? No sex, right? Absolutely not, a stabbing and the other one drowned, no sign of rape. That's what the report says, at least. Have a look at that. This one will never be worth anything in a million years. I meant the letter, not the stamp. "My love, you're black as sin and I've got you under my skin" Whoever wrote it isn't all there. Did you see? It isn't signed. There's a scribble, a kind of 's'. Right. Have you drawn up a list of all the residents? An army, almost 700 people, but most only go there to sleep. No one writes letters to someone living in the same building. You don't know love then. But maybe you're right. It's just that this job keeps getting harder. You see, people kill for no reason nowadays. It really has gone badly. You try finding another hot chick like Mizar. - But those two... - Two idiots! They got scared. Listen to me, it's hard renting out a flat where someone was murdered. People don't forget these things. ~ Hi! ~ Hi! Hello Well? Here's the contract, thank him. Father Christmas is real. Thank you. It's very kind of you. Two bedrooms, bathroom, and kitchen. Tell me you grow marijuana on the balcony and I'll pass out. Arthur told me you're subletting a furnished room, so I thought... But don't go expecting anything fancy. It's a modest little apartment but I think you'll like it. It's the one where they killed the black girl. I told you, right? That's life. How else would they empty apartments? Then Andrew will be our first guest. What do you say? Cute. Better to start with a live one. The goose that laid golden eggs, that's what she was. Right, she was just a goose to you, and someone broke its neck. - Pardon? - Pity. No, don't get me wrong, I... - I won't deny it, I liked her. - Sure. What can I say? I have a business to run. - Besides... - Go on. - I admit, her routine was a bit... - Extreme? Extreme, yes, but she never accepted clients' invitations. Never a complaint, never any trouble. I'm moved. Martelli, you should teach in a Catholic school. So she challenged members of the audience, anyone, no tricks. It was all above board, you don't think I'd allow... Change the record, you've got a rap sheet as long as the motorway. Tell me, did she ever lose in that three minute game? - Never, she was good. - Yes, but she could have. - What would have happened? - I don't... He said it himself, if she lost she would have paid. Which means they would have raped her here, in front of everyone. Well it never happened, it's almost impossible in three minutes. Right, whoever killed her took a lot longer. And maybe it was one of those gentlemen who were here last night. All respectable folk, and all of them anonymous members. My clients are what they are. Listen, club rules don't call for... They don't call for me having this brothel shut down! You know, Redi, they say cops have a bad habit of mistreating people. As you can see, they're right. Spit it out, I want the names of all the clients who were here last night. Including the thug who fought with the girl, or I'll lock you up, got it? Yes, okay, I'll tell you everything I know. Still, this place isn't bad, right? Can you believe it, I'd never been here before. - Where did they find the black girl? - In the bathroom. The photos were in all the newspapers. What are you up to? Coming. - Testing out the bed? - Sorry. Not at all, if it's good enough for two then it good enough for three. Sorry, I was just saying. No clutter, doctor's orders. Here, open these. I want to have a shower before dinner. The wine. Thanks. - Let me do it. - No, I've got it. Don't worry, it's nothing. What is it? Are you okay? Blood. I can't stand the sight of blood. I know, it sounds stupid. I'll look for some alcohol to put on it. And you try putting some in your stomach. You wouldn't happen to have some alcohol to treat a wound? You know, at times the tin opener thinks it's a manicurist. The world would be a better place if everyone had my phobia of blood. You can also... without blood. Mizar, it was you! A bloodless murder. Am I meant to laugh? I'm going before the water gets cold. She has her ways. - But I assure you she's a real friend. - Sorry, I'm a nervous wreck. I keep thinking about Mizar. She was a very beautiful woman. Really? Was she your girlfriend? No, I never got the chance to get to know her well. Listen, a violin. Nice. Yes, there's an old professor in the apartment next door. - Good, isn't he? - But... How do you know that if you've never been here before? You see, we get at least ten calls a day in our office. It's the tenants complaining. They say he's crazy because he also plays during the night. - Are we ever going to eat? - Marilyn, hurry up, it's ready. Please call her or we'll be here all night. Did you hear? What the hell's wrong with you? Can you hear me? Say something. What the hell were you thinking? Have you gone mad? Don't you know Mizar was killed in there? How do you come up with these stupid ideas? Didn't you like it? Right, she was black. If I were him I'd put you under for half an hour. Under where? Underwater? - You know, he's a strange one. - Why? He can't stand the sight of blood, he won't hear a bad word against Mizar. Then he goes all soft, but... But that was quite a slap, I feel dazed. It's like I can hear a violin. It is a violin. I finally got you! You were with her. Dirty pervert! - With who? - Jennifer. But you can't have her. No one can have her. Outstanding, it really stirs the imagination. - Not bad, right? - Yes. If you ask me, you know why our religion is dying out? Yes, it promises people eternal life but in a boring, dull, heaven. While Islam promises dates and beautiful women. Islam. A heaven like that would immediately be banned for anyone under 18. If only we could. My dear Inspector, we're stuck in the past. It's hardly a great advert. Speaking of adverts, is that why you gave Andrew Antinori a photo of Mizar? I told you, yes, that's why, but I don't know anything else. The day I manage to find a frozen meat company... that wants some grizzly photos, I'll be sorted. Whisky, cognac, gin? I've got it all, even tights and bras. How long have you been friends with Andrew Antinori? About twenty years. Since childhood. - Which leg does he limp on? - Why? Does he have a limp? No, just some little fixations. We've all got our fixations. Some people like young girls, others like stamps. Inspector, Andrew has got a fixation. He loves money, it makes him feel safe, but don't we all? - Thanks for the whisky. - No, put it underneath. Jennifer! What is it? What's going on? It's so cold. Why did you open it? There was a man. Who was there? What are you talking about? I saw a shadow. It was a man. - He ran away. - You still believe in ghosts, great. You had a flashback, I'm telling you. All that rubbish your husband made you take. They make you trip even when you're not high. He was here. Believe me, I saw him! Flown away. Like a bat. I felt him touch me, it was like a horrible shadow, I swear. If you ask me... You need a man. Yes, how do you go from group sex to a vow of chastity? Or was it my joke in the bathroom that got to you? It was stupid, I'm sorry. Now sleep, and let me sleep, okay? Goodnight. Six million a year. That's thirty million for every single apartment. They should reintroduce the cuts system. It's the only way a poor inspector like me will have a chance of buying a flat. I have to earn my salary. I had an important appointment and I'm already late. Why not call them? Half an hour won't hurt anyone. Yes, of course, but they're waiting in a bar. Did he say he was coming right away? She lives near us. - Who? - The one on the stool. - So what? - I have an idea. - One of your stupid ideas, I guess. - Wait a minute. Wait here. - Hi! - Hello. Me and my friend live in the flat that black girl used to live in. Right, the blonde and the brunette. - My name's Marilyn. - A pleasure, I'm Sheena. Listen, you lived next door, did you know her well? Sure, I met her on the stairs, in the lift, why? I read in a newspaper that she earnt 50,000 lira a night, is it true? Maybe. Do you really like money? Aren't you going to introduce me to this beautiful young lady? Yes, dad, she's our new neighbour, Marilyn. Good morning. I'm going back, perhaps he tried calling and... Pretty, isn't she? She's the virtuous one in the family. - Are you sisters? - No, friends. What are you talking about? I'm not accusing you of anything. My dear architect, I just want to have a little chat. I confess I'd have done the same thing if I were you. We're men, aren't we? Who doesn't have a weakness for coloured women? Everyone dreams of screwing a black woman. "You're as black as sin and I've got you under my skin" Sorry, but I don't have time for your sexual digressions. That isn't why you're here, is it? In a way. Yes, hello? What do you want? You want me to call the police? Yes. Tell them. Tell them your husband raped you. A bit at a time, like the petals of an iris. You're mine, Jennifer. Mine and nobody else! You belong to me. You're nothing but a thing. And as such, you must always make yourself available. - What is it? - What do you mean? It's the bill for you paid after dining with the girl from the Private Club. - You left the club together, right? - Yes, it's true but I... No, there's no need to explain. There's nothing wrong with going out for a meal. You see, going out with a pretty black girl without being noticed... is impossible in a city like this. It's like a Chinese guy spying in Russia. Sure, but we split up after we left the club, I took her... To a taxi rank, I know. Don't worry, I checked. Us cops also work every now and then. You don't really think I killed her to end the night in an original way? No, but you should have come to us after you heard she'd been killed. That doesn't mean a thing. My dear architect, it might sound like a cliche... but the path to a life sentence is a collection insignificant things. There's an Andrew Antinori who works for Gelli Properties. And Gelli Properties built and maintains the building on via Verdi. Where one fine day a girl was killed, and another drowned in the bath. And what do we have here? We've got an office. An office with blueprints of all the apartments. A flirtatious architect who comes and goes from the building as he pleases. And would you believe it, he's the last person to see Mizar alive. Well? Well, even the most distracted judge would take notice. Go figure for a cop. Goodbye. No trips or weekend breaks for the next few days. Leaving the city wouldn't be very advisable. Jennifer, I was just about to... What? The police? The police have just left. Don't move, I'm on my way. There he is. Don't lose sight of him. I'll get a taxi. Okay, chief. - What happened? - I was going insane up there. Adam's continuing to torment you. Just forget it. It's unbelievable. At this point you should report him. Try not to think about it for now, okay? Yes, yes, lobster, champagne. The usual nonsense. The strawberries and cream have just arrived. Looks delicious. It's me again, chief. - Any news? - Nothing... They spent half an hour walking in the park. Then half an hour on a bench. Talking. Then they started again. Hand in hand, loving stares. Smiles. Like they're in love. The usual nonsense, chief. Damn it, where are they? I don't see them! I'll call back. Goodbye. And thanks for everything. - You're not like the others. - It's all a facade. I want to get into bed with you just like the others. - I'd sleep better. - Don't speak too soon. - No, Adam, let go! - Quiet! You're not Adam. Don't move. You mustn't move. Who are you? Who are you? Let go of me! Help! Close it! Dear god, close it. What happened to you? A jealous guy or a bit too demanding? Someone attacked me. I didn't see him clearly, just a shadow. That's quite a resourceful shadow. Calm down, dear. I'll get something to cover you. My name's Sheena, we met in the bar, remember? - What's your name? - Jennifer. Jennifer Offermann. Yes, of course, your friend told me. You're the new tenants, right? Here, dear. I hoped we'd become friends but not in such a strange way. That man... God, I can't even explain it. It's all so horrible. Hi, dad. Don't mind him, he's a lunatic. What do you expect at his age? Not that me and him don't ever talk. Let's go, I'll come with you. - We'd better call the police. - Yes, sure, but let's check first. Don't be afraid. I'll be with you. Look, that lamp. He did it. There's no one here. This place frightens me since that poor girl... Some strange things have been going on here for a while. You're shaking. Don't be afraid, I'm here, I won't leave you alone. What are you two up to? I was attacked, here at home, a shadow that... That turned into a woman. Hi, Marilyn. What's this? It's blood. - Why an iris? - It was a symbol for Adam. Very interesting. He loved you, perhaps he was rather forthcoming, and sent you flowers. But you stubbornly refused his floral gifts. So he stabbed himself square in the chest for the pain. - It's a theory. - No, it's nonsense. Precisely. Let's try and come up with something more plausible. Your husband uses you, he loves you, wants you, in a masochistic way. Porn magazines in his hands instead of cooking or gardening books. Along with the threats, when he sees you he hits you. And he's always got some heroin in his pocket to cure his headache. These are all things you told me, which I already knew. You have to admit, there's enough here for you to want someone like him dead. - The shadow man. - Yes, precisely. The shadow man. Doesn't that seem rather vague to you? So you think I made it all up. I called for help so I'd have two witnesses when the body was discovered. No, something doesn't add up and it puts you in the clear. For now at least. There were two other bodies before you and your friend went to live there. Your Rimmel. I'm ridiculous. No, a beautiful woman's never ridiculous. Listen, I want to help you and your friend. - But you've got to help me. - How? By staying in that apartment. - But it's dangerous. - Yes, I know. You're free to refuse, obviously, but I think it's worth trying. I don't know how but we'll get him. Of course, we'll never let you out of our sight. Don't worry, sometimes we get it right. Now, if you don't mind, I'll offer you something, even though I'm on duty. Where are the cups? Under 'c' for 'cups' They file everything. Excuse me. Be careful of new friendships. Even female ones. What exactly did he say? That Sheena thinks we're like the Great Wall of China... for a dog that wants to pee. - Word for word. - What a guy. I had no idea cops were so much fun. I want to go out! Leave me alone! Who lives in the apartment next door? The old lady, the crazy one with the alcohol, I think she lives alone. No, she isn't alone. She's talking to someone. She must have a lover, or she talks to her husband's ghost. Quiet. It's the same voice as the man who attacked me. I recognise it, it's his. Like a madman. It's his voice, I'm sure of it. I don't hear anything. We can't trust anyone! It's the old lady. If you're old and suffer from insomnia you end up talking to yourself. 'La Stampa' And the one with the skeletons. You'll like it this week, it's full of dead bodies. - She buys some trash. - It's all she buys. Horror, adult comics, and obituaries. If you ask me, she isn't all there. Fun. Pofice? In that case. Excuse me. How come they always recognise me? Yes, I get it, the usual nonsense. I know, but the state hasn't got anything more interesting for you. What? No, try not to lose him or I'll send you back to uniform. - Inspector. - Yes? The handwriting analysis for the murder of the black girl. A woman. Why didn't I think of it before? Yes, I knew her. It's not difficult, living on the same floor. Then why post it? It's a waste of stamps. The letter is of no importance. I wrote it for fun. Why not play with some men for a change? However, no more writing, it might get you into trouble. According to Kinsey, less and less women are interested in men these days. Always less. And it's the same on the other side. Must we really discuss it? My father's rather old-fashioned. He doesn't understand these things. Okay, let's forget about your problems. Who is Andrew Antinori? I just want to love you. Really love you, believe me. Chief, they're in bed but I've got nothing to do here. You're out of luck, the Inspector isn't here. So what do I do now? Go play with yourself. Go to Hell. Hi. My god, Marilyn. Help! - It wasn't me. - It was him! Murderer! Let me through! He ran off in that direction! Do you have a phone? Customers were making long-distance calls so the boss had it disconnected. That must have hurt. Go screw over someone else. You're an idiot, that's what you are. You let him get away just at the right time. I didn't take my eyes off him, not even to go shit. We've already been in the shit for quite a while. I didn't see him attack her, she grabbed on to him... but she was already covered in blood. You never see a damned thing. Four bodies in seven days. The commissioner wants the killer but you didn't see a thing. It wasn't Andrew. Why would he? Sit down. - Don't you realise it's not possible? - It's not possible. Perhaps Andrew's sick and kills in moments of madness. No, Andrew isn't crazy, and no one saw him attacking Marilyn. Perhaps, but a lot of the people who were there would swear the opposite. Listen, it can't have been Andrew. He can't stand the sight of blood. I cut my finger the other day and he almost fainted. It goes back to a childhood trauma. Interesting, but that might incriminate him rather than clear him. There's a verse in an Ossian poem. "Why those strange drops of blood on Jennifer's body?" A killer who kills because he's scared of blood. What if he suffers from the same thing? - I can't believe it. - Now I'll tell you what happened. Andrew stabbed your friend and ran away. Then he came back. He has a good excuse to return to the scene of the crime. - An appointment with you. - It's not true, he didn't kill anyone. The first one was a prostitute and perhaps he slept with her. The second one, the black girl, they were together the night before. Then he hooked up with you and it cost your husband his life. Then your best friend dies in his arms. You've got to admit, we have quite a few reasons to lock up your hero. The bodies are piling up and the only thing you can do... is pick someone up and say, "Here he is, he's the killer" "Why did he kill them?" "Because he's a lunatic" You overestimate us. We can't even catch that lunatic. Thank you. Leave me alone. Don't turn around! Don't move! Don't look at me. No one must ever see me. Why can't I look at you? Your skin is burnt. Who are you? Why do you hide? You must do as I say. You must obey me. - Quiet! - Help! Help! Stay here! Please! Help! Please! Help! David, stop! Go next door, now! What are you doing in my home, whore? I'm trying to find out who's filling this building up with dead bodies. And you defend that monster, you protect him! Shut up, you fool! My son's never hurt anyone. I protect him and hide him because you're evil, you're all evil! Does that poor boy bother you? You're no better than him. You hide under your smart clothes and perfumes, go away! Go back to your world of normal people. Whores, lunatics, drug addicts and murderers. Nothing, no trace of Antinori. Keep looking, I'm convinced he's still here in the city. I've found it. - Found it? - Garibaldi in Dijon. Pink 20 lira. They can't find the 20 liras anymore, let alone a Garibaldi. Hello? The Inspector's busy. I get it, yes, you've found the monster. Of course I believe you, what does it take to find a monster? Yes? Really? Hello? Check the other room as well. - No one? - No. So you live alone. Alone, for twenty years, since my poor husband died. No, it's not true. She's hiding him, I saw him here. His face is disfigured, completely burnt. And his hands... Where are you hiding him, you old witch? - That's enough. - Look for him, he's got to be here! I'll have you committed! I saw him, he's here! Inspector! - I'm sorry but we had to check. - Come when you want. I'm always so alone. No trouble at all. Thank you. Let go of me! Let go of me! - Will you stop? - I said, let go! Listen, call an ambulance, 911. Call your grandmother if you want. But stop playing the cop and go back to your stupid stamps! - You're going to let her... - Forget about it. We've got enough on our plate. Hello? Jennifer, is that you? Andrew, where are you? It doesn't matter, I want to see you. I guess they're watching you. Listen, there's a demolition yard near the north entrance to the motorway. I'll be waiting for you. Make sure you're not followed. Okay, I'll come as soon as it gets dark, but be careful... Hello? Andrew. Andrew. What's wrong? Am I really that frightening? Sorry, Sheena. I'm a nervous wreck. And I'm not? With everything that's going on. If it wasn't for my nuisance of a father I'd have left already. I agree, that much I do now. I think we might get on. You don't believe the gossip, do you? They say so much about me. That aside, if you find somewhere nice I could come and live there as well. If you want me to, of course. What about your father? You'll leave him all alone? Look... I doubt he'd mind, it's not like he cares about me. - We're going down. - Damned lift, I didn't touch anything. - It's not moving. - Here we go again, it's broken. Great, we've ended up in the basement. It looks like the car deck on a ship. - I'd never been here before. - There must be some stairs. Let's look for them. Come on, don't be afraid. Who is it? Is someone there? Jennifer! Help! It's me, Andrew. Don't you recognise me? What are you doing here? I saw you in the demolition yard but you were being followed... so I couldn't approach you. So you think I'm guilty as well. Then go if you don't believe me. I said go! Yes, don't come any closer. Go up those stairs. Go! You're just like the others. Go! What are you waiting for? Go! Help me, Inspector! - Get him! - It was him, he's the killer! It's horrible, I can't believe it! Look, chief, he killed another one. We found a passage, it leads to a garage at the rear of the building. I'm afraid he got away. Get them to take her away. David. You can come out now, dear. David, where are you? Don't be afraid, they won't be back. It's over. David. Where are you? Dear god! Where have you gone, my darling? So he came here to hide. It's clear. - How did the old man take it? - He's playing, listen. Poor guy, that daughter was all he had. Through there. Have you really decided to go? Yes. I can't stay here anymore after all that's happened. - Where will you stay? - In a hotel. Look, Antinori escaped and we still haven't found him. I can ask one of our officers to take you. No, thank you. I called my photographer friend, he's coming to get me. Is the building under surveillance? Two in the basement, two in the garage, and two on the street. Good.

He strangled his mother-in-law with a sock, can you believe it? Stay alert. - Understood? - Don't worry. - Goodbye, chief. - Get that hand down. Professor! Professor. You. A little trick of mine.

It's your fault I killed my poor Sheena! Yes, it's your fault, I thought it was you in the basement. And now you must die! Romeo's already there. Follow him, Juliet, he's waiting. Daddy. I'm sorry, I'm $0"?! It's all over. You've got to forget it. It was a nightmare. Yes. Yes, Jennifer, yes. - That means you're... - Yes. And now you'll die just like the others. It's your fault. - Chief. - Yes? Look at this. Stamps, Czechoslovak I think. They might be valuable. - Redi. - Yes, go on. We're going through a season where all the cherries have worms. What do you think? That it's a great year for worms. Hello? It's you. Come up, I'm waiting. 'Any resemblance to actual persons or actual events is purely coincidental' Subtitles Chain Production Ltd.
