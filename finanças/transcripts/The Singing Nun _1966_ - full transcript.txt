Are you hurt, Sister? It's a miracle we weren't both killed. Couldn't you see me, Sister? Oh, yes, I-- Of course-- Are you all right? I had the right of way, Sister. I was coming right down the center of the road. Right down the center, in plain sight. You just couldn't miss me. I almost didn't. -Oh, thank you. -Are you sure you're all right? Oh, yes. Oh, I'm all right. I just hope the scooter's all right. You see, we all drive it at the convent. What a world. The last thing I expected to see coming at me is a nun on a scooter. What kind of nuns are they making at that convent nowadays? Hard-headed ones, thank God. Oh, my. Go on, here. I know. Who wants that? There you are. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, dear. There's someone at the door! -I'll go. -1 hope it's Father Clementi with more paint. I have to attend to everything. I can't be two places at once. -I'm getting it-- -Don't bother. I was only peeling potatoes for stew. -Nothing to do but answer doorbells. -Well, as long as you're not busy. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was out of order. Oh, no. It worked perfectly with every pull. I'm Sister Ann. Oh, yes. I'm Sister Cluny. We were expecting you earlier. I'm a little late. I came on the scooter. I put it under the shed outside. Oh, I'm sorry. That, uh--? That is part of your effects? Sister Adele's in here. My guitar. -Guitar? -Yes, Sister. I would suggest the best place for her is in the music closet. I'll take good care of her. What's that funny smell? It's either fresh paint or my stew. Well, let's hope it's the fresh paint. Sister Ann, welcome. Oh, my dear child. Welcome to Samaritan House. Thank you, Mother. I'm so happy to be here. You must be tired after your trip. And hungry too, I imagine. I was beginning to worry about you. You are a little late. I know, but I was riding along pretty fast on the scooter... ...when this barge captain whistled at me. The boat whistled. This farmer in a cart landing on my head... ...and these cobblestone streets, I'm still bouncing. Well, anyway, you are here. Did you have any difficulty in finding us? No, but when I turned the corner, I thought I had the wrong address. The streets are so-- And the people. We know. That's why this is the ideal spot for us, don't you think? Of course, Mother. I just hadn't pictured it as quite this ideal. -I'm glad you brought your guitar. -I'll put it away. No, Sister Cluny. It's quite allowable for Sister Ann to keep it with her. She won't be a nuisance, Sister. -Sister Ann. -Sister Elise. We wondered when you'd be here. You're usually early. -I'm a little late-- -Sister Ann. Sister Brigitte. Sister Mary. Sister Ann. Oh, this is a fine reunion. It's so good to see you. -Guess how I got here? -How? -l was permitted to borrow the scooter. -No. -Not really? -It turned out to be quite an adventure. This is going to be the community hall when it's finished. All this? - It's enormous. - We have all our meals here too. And it'll be for dances and meetings and-- - And singing and parties. - For all the neighborhood people. Father Clementi promised to make us some chairs and whatever else we need here. He's a wonderful carpenter. Chairs? Oh, we could put six along that wall and four over there and-- Oh, I'm sorry, I get carried away. I'll have the curtains ready in a day or so. When we're finished, this place won't look so empty. Empty? Oh, I don't think it looks empty. I think it looks wonderful. And if we just move the piano over there-- I'll give it a push. You see what I mean. Would you like to see the rest of the house now? I'd love to. -I'm being taken on a tour of inspection. -Good. Start with the kitchen. You'll be spending your time there. I don't mind. Well, what do you think of her, Sister Cluny? Talks a lot. She has a natural enthusiasm. It may be just what we need around here. We need workers, Mother, not enthusiastic guitar players. -The guitar goes where she goes. -A personal possession? A material remembrance of her past life? Is this part of our liberalization too? -Yes, and I think for the better. -Maybe. Why, she ever came here unaccompanied, on a scooter. Her true and greatest protector was still with her. Why, I hoped they'd send us a more mature sister. Ah, but we need our young nuns, Sister Cluny. They come to us fresh from their tranquil convents... ...and still fired with their ambition to become missionaries. Eager, hopeful and-- Well, yes, I must admit it, inexperienced. They're like girls graduating from school into the world. And their training here won't be easy. Some of their bright dreams of becoming missionaries may fade... ...in the harsh reality of hard work. Some of them may even fail us... ...or we may fail them. But those that go on, Sister Cluny, they will be nuns. I still say this brand-new one doesn't seem to have any special skills... ...except playing that guitar. Don't be too hard on that guitar. It belonged to her father. And she was a very little girl during the dreadful war years when he-- Well, the guitar is really the only family she's ever known. It's going to get noisy around here. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Oh, Father Clementi. I was hoping to run into you. Mr. Messeraux asked me to tell you that barrel of flour for the sisters... -...will be sent from the bakery tomorrow. -Oh, thank you. They're grateful for any help. And the merchants in this neighborhood have been so kind. -Oh, we're happy to be able to help, Father. -Well, we appreciate it. Thank you again. Yes, Mr. Muller, I'm afraid we've run out of paint for the walls. What was the last color I gave you? -Beige. -Beige. -How are you, Mrs. Muller? -Marvelous. No, two gallons, please. Anything else, Father? Well, we could use a pound of tenpenny nails. Tenpenny nails. Mm-hm. And I need another pot of glue for those chairs I am finishing. Pot of glue. There you are. Oh, and some steel wool to hand rub a pulpit for the choir. Oh, some steel wool. Yes, Father. Oh, good. -Anything else, Father? -No, that will do it. How much is all that, huh? I hate to charge the nuns for things they need. Why, thank you. That's more than generous. I wish I could do something for you in return. Father, if you ever have a free moment, I do need shelves next to my stove. It's a bargain. I'll have them finished, put them up for you... ...by Saturday morning, all right? Thank you again, so much. Forget something? The sisters mentioned a few hooks for the closets. I'm sorry. I'm getting so forgetful. Next time, I'll make a list. All right? Yes, hooks. How many? A dozen? Lead us not into temptation but-- I've forgotten "deliver us from evil." I have it. Good. All right. Deliver us from evil. Oh, I did it again. And we are minus a cup. Oh, well, never mind. I'll consider it mine and drink out of the saucer. There's no need to worry. They will understand you. My music should give me a good ear... ...but I suppose I'm so happy to be here, I'm just not thinking. Can you imagine how excited I will be if someday we are sent to Africa? You must not expect a Garden of Eden. It is burning hot there and so poor. Don't you want to go? Of course I want to go, Sister. But more than that, I want you to go. And learn how my people sing the Mass. But first we must learn to live here. "Eat as those around you eat. Share their suffering, share their poverty and your love of God." That's what Saint Dominic said. No use hiding the evidence. Sister Cluny counts the china every night, instead of sheep. Well, she does? Sisters, Father Clementi is here. Wait till you see the harvest he's reaped for us. Father Clementi! Oh, wonderful. Nails, glue, paints, and hooks for the closets. -Thank God. -And wonderful. The Mullers were so generous... ...I promised to make shelves Mrs. Muller's been needing. Here, I'll take it out of your way. Excuse me. It goes to my workroom. Well, Sister. I haven't seen you before, have I? Let me guess. Ah! I have it. You are our latest and very welcome addition. Sister-- No, Sister Mary, don't tell me. -Sister Ann, am I right? -Yes, Father. And I am Father Clementi of this parish. Here, let me get rid of this. Now I can welcome you properly. I assure you, you are most welcome, Sister Ann. I'm most fortunate to be here, Father. She brought a guitar. Oh, wonderful! For our recreation hour, we always have a little music here. Up to now, just the best we could do with a piano, but a guitar? That will add spice to our familiar "Brother John." -Will you get your guitar and join us, Sister? -Of course, Father. Now we have an orchestra. -1 always do the piano, Father. -Of course. Of course. -And beautifully. -Thank you. Ah. Just in time for our evening concert, Mother. I never miss it. Don't tell me you've never noticed my fine alto, Father. Have you an E, Sister Cluny? No, you have to get along with an A. Are you ready? There's a smile on your face Brother John Brother John There's a smile upon your face Brother John Brother John When there's a smile upon your face Then the world's a happy place When you wear a gloomy frown The world comes tumbling down Won't you smile for us all, Brother John? -Brother John -Brother John -Brother John -Brother John When there's a smile upon your face The world's a happy place Won't you smile for us all, Brother John? -Brother John -Brother John -Brother John -Brother John When there's a smile upon your face The world's a happy place Won't you smile for us all, Brother--2? Well, what happened? Why did we all stop? You sing very well, Sister! I say my prayers with my guitar, Father. Well, compared to you, I'm a croaking frog. Do you mind singing a little prayer without the frog? You tell them about "Sister Adele." Oh, yes, please. Sit down, Sister. Thank you, Father. I will sing of Adelita I will sing of Sister Adele ‘Twas never a servant so faithful She wants but to serve the Lord well Adele is my dear companion Together we've traveled so far Together we sing as we worship Adele is my Spanish guitar Though you're only a wooden guitar And so humbly the music you play If there's love in your heart Wherever you are The Lord will not turn you away And so together We'll sing his praise And the music the Lord shall hear We'll tell his glory in a thousand ways And we'll plead for his love so dear That was marvelous. Mother Prioress, is this liberalization? Make a joyful noise unto the Lord. Come before his presence with singing. Come on, kick it! Kick it! Get it! Come on, kick it! Come on, kick! -Come on. -Come on, let's go. Come on. You kicked me. My foot missed the ball. No, your aim was perfect and you hurt my shin. Why don't you wear stockings? I do. You can't play soccer in long skirts. Why do you wear long skirts? The same reason you wear stockings, to keep my legs warm. Oh, no, no, no, you don't. Mm-mm. I want to talk to you. Now. You don't look like a young man who would kick anybody. Why did you? I wanna get back to the game. Oh, oh, you don't. -What's your name? -Dominic. Dominic Arlien. Oh, I'm surprised you won't answer me... ...because you're named after a very great man, Saint Dominic. -Would he have answered you? -He would. And he never would have kicked me. You two gonna play or not? - I'm wounded. - Come on. Mothers are here. Time to go, boys and girls. Mothers are here. Hey. Well, time to go. Mothers are here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Bye-bye. Dominic? Your mother did not come for you? I-- I haven't got a mother. I haven't either. -You haven't? -No. Well... ...maybe you don't need a mother anymore. -Do you need one, Dominic? -Uh-uh. I'm a good fighter. I don't need anybody. Somebody may need you though. -Who? -A lot of people. They don't like me. They're afraid of me. Maybe you don't give them a chance. First, you have to start by liking them. And then their liking you will come as easy as anything. Who cares? I could lick you. What muscles! With all that power, you could be a real leader. Once a boy named Dominic To whom I sing this song Kicked someone in the shins And knew that he had done wrong Now if this boy named Dominic Ever tries another whack He's going to be sorry When that someone kicks him back But he wasn't really a bad boy And he grew up big and strong And he fought for all the good things Instead of the things that were wrong If this boy was really sorry This could end up a true story -You made that up. -That's right. I made it up for you. Dommie? Dominic! -That's my sister. I gotta go now. -Run along, Dominic. -l kicked you on purpose. -1 know. -Hurry up, Dom! -Oh, Nicole! Tuck your shirt in. Are you ready to go? I'm Sister Ann, Nicole. We're very happy having Dominic here. I wonder if you heard we're going to have young people's dances every Saturday? Why, no, I didn't. We hope you'll come and bring an escort. I can't. I work Saturdays. What a shame. What sort of work do you do, Nicole? I'm a maid. These people entertain a lot. We have to go now, Dominic. Say goodbye. Bye, Sister. Can we finish the game tomorrow? Of course. See you tomorrow, Dominic. Goodbye, Nicole. It's too bad you didn't come earlier, Father. We could've used a good goalie. Oh, I went to see a fellow I know who works for Primavera Records in Ghent. Records we could play at our dances, Father, if we had a juke box? This time, it was the other way around, Sister. I wasn't taking, I was giving... ...giving them a chance to make a recording of you. -Of me? -Yes. Why, they probably expect and I-- What did you tell them? Not them. I just talked to my friend for a while. Well, give or take an hour or so. And he more or less gave in. How do you feel about it? Well, I don't know. I only sing hymns, my own thoughts. -Besides, Mother Prioress wouldn't allow it. -She did. Truly now, Sister, I've given this a great deal of thought. Oh, the record will only be sent to convents, you see? So that sisters all over the world can find joy in your songs. But I'm so busy here... ...and the time it takes to ride back and forth to Ghent-- Oh, all right. -When? -Tomorrow. Oh, no. -It'll be just another minute, Father. -Thank you. It won't be long now, Sisters. But when she took her drums, I hoped I never saw her again. -Hello there. -Hello. Would you like a cigarette? No, thank you. What's the name of your act? Our act? Oh, what's the name of yours? We're the Mexican Marauders. Oh, we're the Dominican Desperadoes. -Cute. -Sisters. Thank you. I will see you later. Mr. Gerarde will see us now. Sorry to have kept you and the sisters waiting. I might've known a high-pressure character like you would be ahead of time. No apology needed, Robert. We are deeply grateful for your kindness. Think nothing of it. I've arranged to put you in Studio B. Right this way. -Where are you taking the jukebox, boys? -To the storeroom. Is it out of order? No, we just don't need it anymore. Studio B is to the left. Give me an idea of how many records you'll need for the convent. -As a guess, a thousand. -A thousand. And upwards. Here we are. -Not very large, I'm afraid. -Oh, it's large enough. Imagine, Mr. Gerarde, if we had had these facilities at the conservatory. Paris Conservatory. Lucienne. Sister Ann, Robert. Five years ago, I lost track of you. -How do you want this, Mr. Gerarde? -Tape it. We studied at the conservatory together. She graduated, I quit. If I saw you on the street, I wouldn't recognize you-- I know. You cannot tell one nun from another. But it's easy. This is Sister Michele, Sister Mary, Sister Ann. Sister Ann? Good Lord. Exactly. -You'd better lower that all you can. -Yes, sir. Emile, be sure of the balance on this. I promised Father Clementi a perfect job. Right. Adele, you're looking well. Sister Adele now, Robert. -You got her too, did you, Father? -She's a very devout guitar. She never told you about the night she spent in a pawnshop... -...to pay for my fine when I was arrested. -She does not tattle. And he'd only been speeding, Father. Usually he was a very hardworking music student. What do you do here, Robert? Mr. Duvries and I are partners. I suppose I'm an executive. Sounds impressive, but what do you do? This and that. Discover new talent, shape and groom their careers. Make sure their affection for Primavera Records is deathless. -And legally binding? -Both ways, Father. -We're all set here, Mr. Gerarde. -Fine. -Father, won't you be seated over there? -Thank you. What will you sing, Sister Ann? -A little hymn. Sister Michele. -Thank you. A little hymn? All Sister Ann's songs are like prayers. Well, I really must be leaving. Back to-- Emile will take good care of you. Good luck on your hymn. Thank you, Robert. -Sister. -Thank you, Sister Mary. Could I hear a few bars? Far beyond the stars That's fine, thank you. Far beyond the stars My soul is longing to go There beyond the sun To a better place I know Through the darkest night I can see the heavenly glow -Far away -Far away Beyond the stars -Far away -Far away Beyond the stars Time ages of time Yet is my time, so dear The bells hasten to chime Warning the hour is near The road leads far away And soon the days disappear And I sing hallelujah Unto him Alleluia Far beyond the stars My soul is longing to go There beyond the sun To a better place I know Through the darkest night I can see the heavenly glow -Far away -Far away Beyond the stars -Far away -Far away Beyond the stars Yeah Love that baby, yeah Oh, that baby Baby, you're all mine She's my baby, yeah Love that baby, yeah Oh, that baby Gerarde, one moment, please? Gerarde, we need Studio B and it's full of nuns. They should be through by now, Duvries. Let's see. There beyond the sun To a better place I know Through the darkest night I can see the heavenly glow Far away Far away Beyond the stars Far away Far away Beyond the stars Not bad for a nun. Not bad at all. Perfect, Sisters. Is that all? -That is all. -Thank you. Well, Robert? I didn't oversell her, did I? You have a job as manager if you ever decide to take off that collar. Sorry. It's nailed on. Heh-heh. And you, you were absolutely-- What can I say? I'm so happy you liked our little hymn, Robert. - Liked it? Emile, we'll do another. - Right. -Another? -Yes. -You have something else? -Yes, Robert. May I see? Here you are. That's not what sleeves are for. Here. I didn't know you had a pocket in that dress. I have one here and another here. This is for my prayer book and my other rosary, see? You could hide a lot of stuff in there, couldn't you? Certainly could. I only got room for my bottle tops and corks. -No room for the rosary? -1 don't need one. Oh, I do. -I count the beads when I say my prayers. -You could count in your head. Oh, I say so many, I might get mixed up. You're not very smart, are you, Sister? Not very. Come on. Here it is. Hello, Papa. Who's this? I'm Sister Ann from Samaritan House, Mr. Arlien. Well, he's a big boy. He doesn't need to be walked home. Usually Nicole is with him. She didn't come for him today. You can never tell about her. Aren't you gonna let Sister in, Papa? Well, if she wants to. The place doesn't look like much, but with Nicole out working all hours... ...and with me not feeling up to it, what do you expect? I understand, but that should not stop us from having a visit. Well, I was just gonna go down to the corner. -You mind if I stay? Nicole may possibly-- -No, no, that's quite all right. That's quite-- You just make yourself at home. Papa goes to the corner when he feels terrible. Hey, look, another cork. -You wanna see my room? -Yes. This is Papa's room. Now, come with me. Nicole and I sleep here. This is Nicole's bed and this is mine. Oh, dear. I tell you what we'll do. Uh.... Let's surprise Nicole and straighten things up for her. Hm? You take the blankets and the sheets off the bed... ...and then we'll make them up. I'll pick up her things. What's the use? They only get messed up again at night. But you sleep better without the lumps. Men don't make beds. Soldiers do in the army. Bed-making time. Resting time. You can't get by that easily. Let's go. Nicole's gonna be home any minute. Come on. All right. Dommie? You home? Uh-huh. Good. Dominic, you stay here and go on working. I'll keep her in the other room. Hm? All right. Papa go out? Nicole? What are you doing here? I came home with Dominic. We wanted to surprise you and straighten your room. I found these. You-- -You snooping-- You-- -I'm sorry. -No, I'm glad. I'll have an opportunity-- -You showed them to Dommie? Of course not, Nicole. -Why did you? -Why don't you leave me alone? Not until we have a talk. I cannot turn my back now that I know about these. I want to help you. I don't want your help. Help from God, then. He hasn't paid the rent so far. And you can get this straight. I'll keep on making these pictures. And if I get enough money, I'll make more and more. What pictures? Oh, it's all right, Mr. Arlien. Nicole and I were just talking. -You give me those. -Mr. Arlien, let me handle this. You don't expect me to support this family and buy your liquor mopping floors, do you? Oh, stop. Keep your hands off her! You come back here. You come back here! How dare you treat her like that? You must use kindness and understanding. -Oh, understanding? -And love, I beg you. Yeah, I only understand one thing. That's my daughter. That's my flesh and blood. It's none of your business. It has to be somebody's business. I'll talk to her. I want you out of here. I don't need you around my children. Out. Out. Get out. Out and stay out. It all started because I wanted to clean up her room. -l wanted to be helpful. -But were you being helpful? Or were you interfering? Nicole was not there to accept your offer of help... ...but you decided to give it anyway. But after I found the pictures, I had to try to talk to her. Yes, of course. Yes. But even though you only suspected Nicole was at fault... ...yet you accused her in front of her father. Now in future, try to make sure that any suspicion of sin... ...remains strictly a private matter between you and the sinner. And I involved her father. Well, you never know what you'll uncover in some places. The truth is, I find it difficult to love a girl like Nicole. I wanted to do so much when I came here and I've made a bad start. Don't expect to win great victories here, my child. Or even in Africa someday. Be thankful for small ones. And try to keep in mind always that your motive is what is important. To serve our Lord. I have a lot to learn. I'll give you a rule to go by. If you can't be helpful, be silent. Thank you, Mother. And thank you, Sister Cluny. A million dollars? That is what I think one album of hers ought to make. Her share would go to our order, be allotted to various missions. Under no circumstances would we consent to anything... ...that might disturb Sister Ann's vocation. No, of course not. But it could be a great blessing. A million dollars usually is. Good afternoon, Mr. Gerarde. -Robert, what are you doing here? -Waiting for Father Clementi. He's in talking with Mother Prioress. I'd like to talk to you. -I'm very busy. I don't think I could take-- -May I sort of follow you around? I would like you to see the place. -l guess it's all right. This way, Robert. -Here. Let me. -Thank you. -Lucienne-- Sister Ann. -It's difficult for me to call you that. -Yes. I've been playing your record over and over. That's why I'm here. To ask permission to sign you to a contract. Do you think there's a market for my hymns, Robert? Sister Mary? -Sister Mary set up our dispensary. -Sister. Nothing elaborate, but a start. -Hello. -Hello, muddy Maurice. Milk time. Oh, look at that pretty face. That boy could find a mud puddle in the middle of the Sahara. Well... Come on, let's have a little drink. Oh, come on, please? Let me live down what I said about your hymns. Exciting, good music. You're an artist. You should be proud of yourself. Thank you, Robert. But if we believe God is in all artists... ...then we should be only humble for what he has given us. All right. But as an artist, you should be heard. -Oh, I am heard here. Ask Sister Cluny. -Here? I'm talking about a-- I'm talking about an audience of millions. People all over the world. People who have never heard your kind of-- Would you like some milk? -Hello. Would you like a little refreshment? -Thank you. -We're running out of tires, Sister. -We'll have to go see Gaston again. What are they doing? Putting rubber heels on shoes. Saving money. Saving pennies. When I'm trying to make you understand that just one album of yours-- Would you care for some milk? Here you are. - Yeah. - We have another-- I don't know much about the protocol of talking to a nun... ...but I knew you once. What made you give up everything for this? It's depressing that you should be here. But I want to be here. You know what I mean. What kind of girl wants to get up in the middle of the night... ...eat a Spartan breakfast, put in a back-breaking day... ...among people like these... ...and live in a tomb? -No girl would. -That's what you do. Not I. I get up in the middle of the night to go to Mass. And then I have a Spartan breakfast. Followed by doing the dishes, studying, visits in the neighborhood... ...playing with the children, feeding them, doing more dishes... ...and then more prayers. You see? Much more glamorous and fascinating than you thought. Isn't it? How can you joke about it? Because I'm very happy. I even have a dispensation to laugh once in a while. Good. I still like to laugh with you. But I don't think you realize how much there is in this world you're missing. Maybe you don't understand how much there is outside this world you're missing. Maybe I don't. Now, about the album, will you? Robert, I told you, I'm very happy here. I'm doing what I want to do. My, you have become a stubborn girl. -I've become a nun. -So you turn me down? Yes, Robert. Can't you understand the joy I feel working for God? Don't, please don't pity me. Well, I tried. I'm sorry. Don't be. I have good news, Robert. Mother Prioress has no objection to your making the album. Providing the bishop gives his consent. I don't see why not. No, in view of everything, I don't really see why not. You know I'm inclined to be blunt, Monsignor. Suppose-- Suppose she has to sing before an audience. Sister, you sing in church, don't you, in front of an entire congregation? Well, not with a guitar. And not because someone pays me. Someday you will get your reward and a harp in heaven, Sister. Do your singing, Sister Ann. You will spread the word of God much better and much further than I ever shall. Yes, Monsignor, if that's what the order wants me to do. Does this settle the issue? Thank you, Monsignor. Thank you, Monsignor. Sister Ann. I can tell you now that I knew you'd reach out and take this chance. Yes, Father. With you I shall walk All of my life With you I'll always be With you I shall spend The rest of my life My love in eternity I was worried, wondering where you were at this late hour, my daughter. And found you, safe with God. I was troubled, Mother. And now, are you more at peace? I think so. If you ever-- Remember, I am here too, my daughter. Thank you, Mother. Put on your pretty skirt, my soul You rendezvous You rendezvous Put on your pretty skirt, my soul The Lord we love is waiting for you You wear a happy smile You can't help but rejoice For in a little while You'll hear our Master's voice Put on your pretty skirt, my soul You rendezvous You rendezvous Put on your pretty skirt, my soul The Lord we love is waiting for you I'd like to be as free as the wind That sings everywhere I'd like to be as free as a cloud That floats in the air I'd like to be the flame of a fire That lights the skies with my desire To be with you My Lord, with you Raindrops, raindrops Fall upon my window Sparkle on the leaves Of a thirsty apple tree Raindrops, raindrops Down the hill and through the meadow No time to stop On their journey to the sea See the pretty raindrops Dance upon the rooftops Tumble down the chimneys Then go splashing on their way To every church and steeple The world and all her people There's a miracle of heaven In every rainy day Raindrops, raindrops Fall upon my window Sparkle on the leaves Of a thirsty apple tree Raindrops, raindrops Down the hill and through the meadow No time to stop On their journey to the sea The brook becomes a river And the river flows forever Till the-- - Is it all right if I rest a few minutes? - Yes, of course. I'll be right with you. Andre, get some tea or something, will you? That'll be all for tonight, gentlemen. Thank you. I didn't mean to fade off that way, Robert. I just wanted to stretch a little. No wonder, 14 songs. I was having a wonderful time listening, I forgot how exhausting it must be for you. Why don't you sit down for a bit and relax? That's a fine idea. Five years ago, I'd have taken you out to a fine restaurant... ...for a bottle of wine and some good jazz. Five years ago, I would have accepted. Seems to me, I did. I wish you could have heard yourself. Your voice came across very clear. No echo. I left my echo at home. Good thing too. That one song, number four. -"Alleluia.” -Yes. You put a little pause in there. I like that. That's my kind of song. The music always spoke a special language to you and me. But you've grown. You have a whole new dimension you never had then. It comes from being very happy, Robert. -You know who'd be proud of you? -Hm? -Professor Von Hoffritz. -Oh. "That guitar, Fraulein, is a musical instrument... ...not a defensive weapon.” "Do not clutch it to your bosom like it was your first-born. Do not point it like it was a machine gun in those American gangster films... ...and do not strangle it as if it was this beloved music professor." Oh, you've come a long way from that music student I used to know. -You've come a long way too, Robert. -l suppose I have. I wonder just how did I become a typical business executive. What happened to your music, Robert? It just got lost. I needed more discipline and encouragement to work alone. And perhaps the inspiration I once had. It's too bad. You were very good. I was so certain you would use your talents to brighten the world. Did you ever finish it, Robert? Sister Ann? Ah, Lucienne. What happened to the wonderful plans we made? The good times we had together? Where did I go to? What did you say, Robert? I didn't say anything. Sister Ann, wait till you see what we bring. Wait till you see. We have a feast here. - Oh, thank you, Robert. Look. - You must be starving by now. -Cheese, meat, salami. -Oh, it's lovely. -Some tea? Would you like some tea? -Thank you very much. Here, Sister. Help yourself. -Oh, thank you. -You, Robert. Hey. Oh, my. That girl. Oh, my gosh. -Does anyone here know this girl's name? -That's Jeannette. Miss Jeannette. That is a needle, Sister, not bayonet. -Oh, dear. -Now, try again. The trouble is, I keep thinking about the next step. When I aim this thing at a live arm. When you have to inoculate a hundred screaming children in Africa someday... ...you will not have time to think. Here. Uh, thank you. I-- Oh. -Put her there. -What happened? She was dancing and she just fainted. -Her name is Jeannette. -Thank you, Sister. We'll take care of her. Here you are, Sister. Thank you. Feeling better? Yes, thank you. Have you had many of these fainting spells? Some. I'm pregnant. Well, congratulations. I hope you have a nice, healthy baby. I'm not going to have a nice, healthy anything. I'm going to have an abortion. You shouldn't even think such a dreadful thought. -Why not? -Having a baby is a wonderful thing. Oh, now, just a minute-- And you're planning to have your baby deliberately killed. -What did you say? -1 said, you're planning to have your-- Sister, sister. I understand how you feel. You're not women, you're just stupid nuns. Listen to me, Jeannette. I was born in Africa in a mud shack. Four children were born there before me. Not one lived to see even six months of tomorrows. There was no food, no sanitation. So my mother went to the village medicine man... ...full of bitter tears. Just as you are. And they tried, with all kinds of voodoo concoctions. But every day of my life, since I have been old enough to understand... ...I prayed my thanks that they failed. What do you hope to do about your baby, Jeannette? Won't you come back? We will do everything we can to help you. She had no right to call me a murderess. I hope she'll come back. Yes, I know you do. I wanted to help her. But I didn't, though, did I? It was a delicate, a very personal thing for her. Maybe you attacked with too much fervor. -Attacked? -Yes. Even if you believe there is a war between right and wrong... ...be sure you do not enjoy the battle too much. When am I going to learn? You will. You will learn. Amen. Amen. Are you not coming, Sister Ann? Do you mind? I wanna work on my music. Won't you sing for us? Oh, I'm sorry, Sister Mary, not tonight. Sister Ann? Don't you feel well? Oh, yes, I'm just a little tired. Well, in that case, maybe you'd better postpone working so much... ...with your music and rest. Oh, I can't. I have an idea for a new song. -It isn't quite right yet. -l see. You have been very much in my thoughts the last few days, daughter. I ask myself if perhaps we're not making a mistake... ...by placing too much importance on your music. And if you might not be risking everything... ...by this misjudgment. Oh, music has always been important to me, Mother. I know. That's just what I'm afraid of. When I was a young nun, to be sent somewhere as a missionary... ...was all-important to me. And then I found the people strange... ...I didn't understand them and so I couldn't love them. -And I thought I was a miserable failure. -1 know. The way I've been a failure with the people here. But my music makes up for that. I think I can do some good. Why can't I love to sing and learn to love all people too? How much love have you to give, my daughter? People need all you have. A little love is not enough. Are you sure that your love for your music is not interfering with your other duties? I hope not. I will pray to God to help me. Well, come with me a moment. I have something to show you. This is from Primavera. They're giving a garden party at Mr. Duvries' home. Publicity for your album. They ask if you'll be good enough to come and bring your guitar... ...and be prepared to sing. You don't have to accept, you know. I'd like to. And I'll be happy to sing for them. Perhaps I should give them something after all they've given us. I'm only concerned with what you give to God, my daughter. But it's my way of doing good. Don't you want me to go, Mother? I think you've already made that decision yourself. I'll write and tell them you accept. How [ love to go For a walk along the street Just to smile "Hello" To the people that I meet And to watch the show Of their happy. happy feet And I say to myself it's a miracle As I walk along I sing a melody It's a happy song I'm sure you will agree And when things go wrong Oh, how it comforts me Then I say to myself It's a miracle Allelu, alleluia I sing as I walk along Allelu, alleluia God gave me such a happy, happy song Can't you feel his love And joy in everything In the wonder of The sparrow on the wing In the stars above and the song I sing In the joy of his love In the stars up above In the song that I sing It's a miracle "Brother John." There's a smile on your face Brother John There's a smile upon your face Brother John When there's a smile upon your face Then the world's a happy place Won't you smile for us all Brother John? Brother John Brother John When there's a smile upon your face Then the world's a happy place Won't you smile for us all Brother John? When you wear a gloomy frown Brother John And when you wear a gloomy frown Brother John When you wear a gloomy frown Then the world comes tumbling down Won't you smile for us all Brother John? Brother John Brother John Brother John When you wear a gloomy frown Then the world comes tumbling down When there's a smile upon your face Then the world's a happy place Won't you smile for us all, Brother John? Brother John Brother John And when your heart is full of love ‘Tis a blessing from above When you wear a gloomy frown Then the world comes tumbling down There's a smile upon your face Then the world's a happy place Won't you smile for us all Brother John? I have a confession to make, Sister. I'm senile. I was against her album. Religious music, I said. What made you think of combining folk music with prayers, Sister? Perhaps I felt God might be tired of our formal, traditional hymns... ...and would enjoy a different kind of prayer once in a while. May I have your autograph? Oh, I'm sorry. I can't do that. You see, I'm not a singer who happens to be a nun. I'm a nun who happens to like to sing. -She's quite witty too. -Yeah. This way, Sister. Can you believe you're really a nun? Yes, easily. I'm a Dominican nun. What does that mean exactly? There are different kinds of orders. Sister, you haven't touched your pheasant. Go ahead, eat. -Where are you appearing next, Sister? -Appearing? Oh, we have great plans for this girl. We'll be sending out releases. -Robert, you take care of that. -That's a little premature, don't you think? -Sister, may I get you an ice? -Yes, thank you. She seems to be enjoying herself. You can't blame her for being pleased with her bit of success. It will be over soon. I wonder how the big stars live through it. The world at their feet? It must be a glorious feeling for a little while. A heady feeling. Well, she's become a top recording artist. Robert tells me they're today's new nobility. Strange that none of us thought of this. -Mr. Gaston? -Mr. Gaston. We've used up our last tire. -You sisters must be rough on rubber heels. -Well-- Help yourselves. Glad to get them out of the way. You're very kind. Oh, this is best. -Thank you. -Thank you. Now, you watch me. Good, bravo. Look at that. Hey, look. It's Sister. Dom, come back here. -Hello, Sister. -Dominic, what are you doing out so late? Piet invited us. He's a rich sailor. Why don't you let him buy you a drink? - No, thank you. - Come on, Dom. - Just a minute, Nicole. - Go back to the table, Dom. Go on! Why is Dominic with you in this place and in such company? They're my friends. Where do you think he ought to be, home alone? Home, with you. You have a duty to your brother. And it's late for a girl your age to be out too. You're out pretty late yourself, Sister. If you must go out, you can always leave him with me. -He'll be safe, then. -He's safe with me. - I don't think so. - 1 think it's time we left, Sister. I'm taking Dominic with me. - Oh, no, you're not. He's staying with me. - Dominic? I said, I think it's time we left, Sister. There's nothing you can do here. That's right. You tell her, Sister. He's my brother. What are you gonna do about it? -Here. Go on, have a puff. -No, thank you. Go on, take a try. Well, what got into you? More letters, Mother. -They're all for Sister Ann. -Well, set them over there, Sister. May I come in, Mother? What is all this? I believe it's called fan mail. That is wonderful. Marvelous. And I bring more good news. I have with me a very important gentleman who's waiting to see you. Mr. Ed Sullivan. Who is he? Millions of people in America watch him every Sunday night on television. Well, that need not concern us here. -Excuse me, Mother. -But-- But the convent in Copenhagen wired to ask for 20 more albums. Where do you want these? There. Don't bring any more until we find room for them. Mother, he has come over 3000 miles just to have a few words with you. -Didn't you get the letter about his arrival? -We haven't had time to open our mail. -Nevertheless-- -Excuse me. Three busloads of boys from Saint Stephen's have arrived. They want to sing their school song for Sister Ann. I'll see them later. Mother, please, Mr. Sullivan-- Well, I suppose it wouldn't be very courteous not to see the gentleman... ...if he's traveled so many miles. Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Fitzpatrick... ...I'm sure you didn't come all the way from New York to Belgium just to visit me. So my I ask why, even though I think I can guess the answer? I'm quite certain, Mother, you're not familiar with our TV show in America. Well, you're right, Mr. Sullivan. I'm afraid I'm not familiar with it. -It's a very clean, family-type show. -Oh, very nice. To get to the point, Mother... ...we'd like to present on our show your Sister Ann. But why, Mr. Sullivan? People can hear her on records. But they'd like to see her. And honestly, if you'd give us permission... ...I can assure you that we'll present her in all dignity and respect. Well, I wish to thank you, Mr. Sullivan. And I regret that I must answer in the negative. Well, just one favor. Could I meet her? Because when I go home I would like to say that I had met her. Well, of course, Mr. Sullivan. Come this way, won't you? Can I help you, Sister Cluny? Over there, Mr. Sullivan. Sister Ann, this is a very great pleasure. -Oh, no. Down there, Mr. Sullivan. -Oh. Sister Ann, this is indeed a great pleasure. I'm a great fan of yours. My name is Ed Sullivan. I come from New York. And I'm here to ask you to sing on our television show. New York? -I'd like that. -Of course I told him no. Oh, and I regret that, Mother, because our cardinal in New York had proposed... ...perhaps we get something for your order that would be badly needed. Oh, we could have used a jeep, Mr. Sullivan. Particularly when we reopen our Africa missions. I was thinking of several jeeps, Father. Several jeeps? It would be a great help if a jeep could've been delivered to our mission. -One or two? Or three? -Sure. One is all we will need, Mr. Sullivan. -Thank you, Mother. -And thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Excuse me, miss, what's the voltage here? I had no idea putting on a television show was anything like this, Mr. Sullivan. May I, please? My only theatrical experience was when I directed a Passion play in Bruges. -This must be quite a contrast, Father. -Oh, yes, and very exhilarating. Max. They look too white. They're like spooks. Can't you put something on them? That lady says nix. No makeup. No makeup. - Hi. - I am sorry, children. -Do you mind, Father? -Hm? Oh, I'm sorry. - Okay, Mr. Sullivan? - Okay, Fitz. -All right, girls, if you'll take your places. -Mr. Fitzpatrick, please. Sisters, not girls. Oh, thank you, miss. All right, Sisters, right this way. There you are. If you'll get on the stool. Fine. May I, Sister? Thank you. No, it's too much white. Do you sisters have any change of clothing? Something dark blue, perhaps? No? Well, I guess we're stuck with the white. - What about the lights? - Okay. Ready, Mr. Sullivan. -Yes, Fitz. -Stand by. Quiet. Five, four, three, two. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight is a very special feature... ...of this very special show. From Belgium, we are going to bring you the voice... ...of a very dedicated young woman who composes and sings her own songs. So now, ladies and gentlemen, here is The Singing Nun, Sister Ann. Dominique, nique, nique 1 will tell of Dominique His goodness to acclaim And I pray the song I sing Will some simple pleasure bring That the world shall know his name 1 will tell of Dominique As I sing this little song And when [I sing the chorus All the world will sing along Dominique, nique, nique It was good Saint Dominique He lived for you and me From the labors long ago Came a better world I know And his love shall always be Though I'm poor, said Dominique As he spoke unto the Lord I will be your humble servant And your love is my reward Dominique, nique, nique 1 will follow Dominique His burdens will I share For his courage will I pray His teachings to obey His words shall be my prayer By the kindness of his heart And the labor of his hand He brought love and understanding As he wandered through the land Dominique, nique, nique 1 will tell of Dominique His goodness to acclaim And I pray the song I sing Will some simple pleasure bring All the world shall know his name Dominique the mighty warrior Was a soldier of the Lord His armor was devotion And the gospel was his sword Dominique, nique, nique It was good Saint Dominique He lived for you and me From his labors long ago Came a better world I know And his love shall always be Through the blazing heat of summer And the chill of winter snow 1 will follow Dominique In his footsteps I will go Dominique, nique, nique 1 will follow Dominique His burdens will I share For his courage will I pray His teachings to obey His words shall be my prayer -Oh, Sister Ann. -It was really beautiful. It was beautiful. Well, we must be sure to thank Mr. Gerarde for making it possible for us to see this. It was really very kind of him, wasn't it? But now it is over and we must get back to our work... ...which has suffered a bit. Not that a little luxury isn't good for the human spirit once in a while... ...but in small doses. Too many luxuries can become as everyday and as expected... ...as, well, Sister Cluny's nightly stew. So, daughters, let us be thankful that tonight... ...Samaritan House will be once more in repose. She's forgotten we promised to be at Primavera to sign those papers. May the Lord keep thy soul May the Lord keep thy coming in And thy going out From henceforth now and forever I want to talk to Sister Ann. Well, she's not here just now. May I help you? It's got to be her. I'm sorry, but she's in Bruges. Some business about her recordings. -We expect her back later tonight. -That won't help. Well, Sister Ann isn't the only nun here. I'm quite willing to help if I knew what you wanted. I only wanted her because Dom likes her. My father's been dragged off. Dom's all alone. Hell, forget it! Wait. -Wait. -"You can always leave him with me." That's what she said. "I want to help you. I'll pray for you." All that bunk. Where is she when you need her? -But she isn't the only nun here. I'll take-- -1 didn't come for anyone else. You're a stranger to Dom. She tells him stories. What could you do? -Well, I can tell him stories. I can-- -I'm gonna take him with me. I don't need her. I don't need any of you. Dominic? -There doesn't seem to be anyone-- -Someone's in there. Dominic? It's Sister Ann. Dominic? Open the door, dear. I'm so glad. Dominic, have you been here all alone? Oh, your hands are like ice. Nicole said you couldn't come. Well, I came as soon as I could. Oh, my. Now-- -Oh, God bless you. -God bless you too. Feeling better? -Where's your father, Dominic? -In jail. And Nicole, where did she go? To work. We didn't have any money. Well, you were very brave to stay all by yourself. I know. Is there any more? Well, let's see what we can find. Well, that won't do. Oh, there's nothing in here but two big brown B-U-G-S. Dead, thank goodness. Oh, we have a lot of them here. That settles it. He can't stay here. How'd you like to spend the night at Samaritan House? -We'll put a cot in the big room downstairs. -All right. I'll get his things ready. His pajamas and whatever else he needs. I sleep naked. I did too when I was your age. Very well, then. He'll need a sweater. I'll leave a note for Nicole so she won't worry about you. It's all right. What are you gonna say? "Dom will stay with us... ...until you call for him. I promise to take good care of him, Nicole... ...so do not worry. He is safe with me. Sister Ann." -Good. -Good. Down. Up. -Down. -That's my place. Down, up, down. All together now. Oh, how I wish I were a Pied Piper I'd play a happy song Sing, Michel. When I dance down the street The children would follow And sing as we go along Very good. Everybody come. Who wants to be the Pied Piper? -All right, Dom. You be the Pied Piper. -I'm the Pied Piper. Everyone follow me. And when the grownups Heard the little children Sing the Pied Piper's song Then maybe they'd learn To love one another And sing as we go along Oh, Mrs. Bouchet, please, the gate must remain closed at all times. Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. Run along, Rene. Come, Rene, you're late. Come on. Who's first? Slide down. I'll catch you. There she is, Robert. Come on, Dominic, that's a boy. I want to try it too. Whee. Oops. Oh. Thank you, dear. Whoo! -Robert! -You're surprised to see me. I came to tell the famous Singing Nun... ...that Primavera wants to send her on a world tour. -You must be joking. -No. -Can we talk somewhere without the music? -Oh, yes. Children, play by yourselves for a while. -Dom, you're still the Pied Piper. -Right. -So, Pied Piper, pipe. -Right. Rats and mice, follow Dominic. Think of it, Lucienne. Paris, London, New York, California, Japan. All those wonderful places. And doing what you like to do best, singing. With Sister Adele, singing all around the wide, wide world. But, of course, I cannot go. -Why can't you go? -Because my life is here. I admit you had this wonderful dedication. You tried it and I respect that. But things have changed. You have a chance for a life in the world. Is the good you do for a handful worth more than what you'd do for millions as a singer? -l can't listen. -Let me finish. Take a close look at what you do as a nun. Taking care of other women's children? My God, what a waste. You should be having children of your own. The children. Dom. I didn't see him until the last minute. He ran right in front of me. - No, no, don't move him, Sister Ann. - I didn't mean to. -Call an ambulance. Quickly. -Yes, Father. With you, I shall walk-- With you-- Father? Any word? Then we keep praying, huh? I've been trying to pray, Father. But I cannot. It was an accident. You mustn't blame yourself. Can't pray? No. I've tried. Father, I need your help. God deserved better from me, but I've given him nothing. What have I given anyone? Your songs, your music. Don't you think you've won a great victory through them? What kind of victory, Father, if I've lost myself winning it? I am a priest. That means, I suppose, that I should be able to give you some answers. You see, I pray with this in my hand. Oh, it means a great deal to me. How much does your music mean to you? It was a friend, a gift from God. I sang to him with my guitar. But I used it for my own glory. My own importance. I liked being made a fuss over, Father, I like being The Singing Nun... ...who could make millions. And I cheapened his gift and he's taken it from me. He's taken nothing from you. He's not a vengeful God, Sister. -Then why can I not pray now? -You can pray. If there is anything I know in this life, everyone can pray. You are praying right now. No, I'm not. I'm not and I have not been. Oh, Father, can't you see? I've been living half in one world... ...and half in another and I'm lost. Lost between them. I've been aware of that. Do you want to leave the convent? No. You answer so quickly. Think. And don't expect anyone else to make that decision for you. That decision was made long ago. Father, when you see Robert, would you give him a message for me? Of course. Will you--? Will you tell him I hope... ...his life will be fulfilled? And what about your life? Make certain, Sister Ann, search your heart. Thank you, Father. What have I done to you? What have I done to you? Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God... ...pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of-- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, God. Thank you. Sister, guess what. I can leave my cast on for another whole week. -You must have a very nice doctor. -Yes. I came to say goodbye, Mr. Arlien. Yes, I guess you heard we were leaving this town. We're going to my grandma's. She has a farm and a pig and everything. Oh, pigs are lovely. Yes. We'll be all right now, Sister. I-- I think there's enough man left in me to give him what he needs... ...and to get from him what I need. I'm glad for you and Dom and Nicole. I don't think the fresh air and the fresh life appeal to her. I wanted to say goodbye to you alone. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am about what happened to Dom. You won't have to worry about him anymore. You won't have to worry about any of us. We'll be out in the country with the pigs. You'll like it there. -Is that what you came to tell me? -Yes. Well, you've told me. Goodbye. I haven't been much of a friend to you, Nicole. You always thought I interfered. Perhaps I did. But I care what happens to you... ...and wherever you go or I may go, I will always care what happens to you. Why? Why should you care? No one else does. Because we're so much alike. You see, I've been bewildered and confused and frightened too. Then you know I've been blaming you for everything. I should have been taking care of him... ...but I left him alone because I wanted to go out. I was sick of him. I was sick of this place. I was sick of everything. I wanted to have some fun. Oh, God, Sister, fun! That's all over, Nicole. Things will be different for you now. Better, happier. Do you really believe that? Yes, I do. Completely. Well, they're waiting for me. Nicole, before you go... ...I want to give you this. Your guitar, Sister? I don't know how to play. It doesn't matter. I wanted to give you something. It's all I have. Please take it. And when you feel all alone, it may speak to you as it did to me... ...and remind you that God is with you, always. -Let me have that bag, Sister. -Oh, thank you. Goodbye, Sister. Goodbye, Dom. I want my name to be Dominic now. Then goodbye, Dominic. Goodbye, Mr. Arlien. Goodbye, Sister. Robert, you didn't have to come in the back door. -Next time, try coming in the front, huh? -I'll do that. -Do you mind? -No. How's the recording business? That record you persuaded me to make, Father. It opened up a whole new world to me. If I'd have known it would end like this, I'd have turned you down. If I'd have seen my own part in it, there would have been no deal. I've decided I am a priest, not a promoter. I can't even find her. She's left my life as abruptly as she reentered it. I've been to the Samaritan House. They told me she was not there. That's all they would say. Do you know where she is? I know she's happy. Isn't that the greatest thing a man can wish for someone he loves? Oh, I know, it is more gratifying to think that he brings the happiness. But for some, joy is a bird soaring upwards. It cannot be earthbound. Will you accept this, Robert? If only I could be certain the choice were her own. It was. Please realize and respect the fact that she closed the doors between you, herself. Thank you, Father. Spoon next to the knife. Spoon next to the knife. Spoon next to the knife. Sisters? A letter from Sister Ann. -Sister Ann? -Yes, Sister Ann. A very quick worker, great help to me in the kitchen. Sets a beautiful table. Spoon next to the knife. - Sisters. - Well, shall I read it now? Yes, please. Thank you. "Dear Mother, dear Sisters: The schoolbooks you sent arrived and were most welcome." Oh, good. And we were so worried. "And while I still have some difficulty with the dialect... ...l try to teach in the language of sympathy... ...which is understood by all. We travel many miles every day to visit remote villages. We start very early in the morning... ...because Africa is a country where everybody... ...and everything starts early. We travel long hours through a beautiful country... ...along dirt roads, carrying a heavy load of supplies. And we pray for Mr. Ed Sullivan every day for giving us our most prized possession... ...the intrepid Dominique. Every day in this wonderful land holds its own surprises. And we're learning to accept them gracefully. I feel we're beginning to establish a wonderful rapport everywhere we go. And I can assure you that we're making many fast friends. We've set up small clinics. And the villagers give us such a warm welcome... ...that we no longer feel like strangers."
