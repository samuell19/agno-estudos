Why are you sad these days? Take care of your work. Lord, do not despair of me. Don't worry about coming here now. Usha, I'm not coming to see you. Why is that? She says she can't sing your songs.

There are many ups and downs in the world. Come with me. Why are you so upset today? Nothing, that... - What do you mean? - Come on. Sit down. Usha is getting married today. I met him by chance. Running around is useless. I did not understand what you said. How can I explain? You are the son of my friend. So, in a way you are my son too. - But... - Not so. Vinod, he's like my son too. You may have seen him on the anniversary. Usha has decided to marry him. Lightning struck somewhere. Yes. A light came on. What do you think, Ashok? Nothing. A light came on. Yes, lightning struck. Of course I was nervous. Caring for wedding guests. Getting their food ready. You have to do all this. Trust me, I have not forgotten you. It will be very good. Vinod is a very good young man.

"For God's sake, please do not destroy my world" "Or I'm going to perish too." What happened to Sir? Why, he did not open his eyes? What happened? - Aren't you going to see Ashok Sir? - No, I'm not going. Sir! Don't worry, Bella. Did you speak to him from your heart? He does not listen to me. He does not listen to poor people. It was such a big event. You did not even inform me. I'll take him to my house. No sir. But in such a case... ... we will not let him go to an unknown house. You will not be able to treat him. Let me take him. Please do not worry. What to do, it's done here. If you are firmly committed to it. Keep this money for treatment. No need sir. I saved money in 20 years of work. I thought I'd give them to you and marry Bella. But even though Bella has to stay unmarried... ... I spend all that money on sir. Hurry it up, Dad. Otherwise they will say that they do not know the virtues of poor people. I'm coming with the doctor. You... Why didn't you come? I was alone here. You met me as a stranger. I have love in me. I can not live without you. Only you can heal me. Only you can heal me, Usha. Usha... Usha... Sir, I am not Usha. I'm Bella. You... Bella, no need to cry. The doctor gave this medicine. Sir, you will be healed. Dad, I found the cure. Sir, I will definitely get well. - Madam. - What do you want today? I came today to give you something, madam. You take it back. - He's not mine. - what? I did not think, that the moon meant for the sky. But it is not for the earth. I have no place in Ashok's heart. Only you can live there. He is your world. - You said... - I lied. I lied. I could not understand. Save your sick one. He does not belong to anyone but you. No one else owns him. This happened to Ashok because of me. But he dies because of you. If he had called me. I, going to him... ... with all the happiness in my life. But he is talking to you. He just wants to see you. I can take care of him. But I will not be able to save his life. Lord, this is the highest jewelry! Lord, the clothes for these princesses. Sir, look at this. These look great. Sir, look at this. Every pearl in this necklace shines... -... than the moon and stars. - Yes, fine. Everything has been brought as you promised. And bring other things quickly. There are only 4 days left for the wedding. Indeed. Usha, look at what I brought for you. These earrings, dresses, pearl necklaces... Can't this marriage be stopped, Dad? There are only 4 days left for the wedding. Now you say... I'm not wrong, stop this marriage. For God's sake, please end the marriage. It is a question of my life and love. I can not tell you more than that. I can not tell you more than that. Stop the marriage. Stop the marriage. Why, did I order these things? What is all this for? What is all this for? What are you doing sir? Invitations have been sent. Guests are coming. She says, stop the marriage. Sir, what are you doing? Did you hear She tarnished the reputation of my ancestors. Accountant, how can that be? How could that be? No need to worry, sir. Go and explain to her. She will definitely agree. Listen to this. A question of family reputation. Sir is going crazy. Save the honor of your old father. It defiles the dignity of the mind. Isladuburf's reputation is shattered. - Sir. - Your attempt failed, didn't it? She does not listen to anyone. There is no way to get rid of this shame. There is no way. There is a way to do that, sir. Ashok is also like a family man. And Usha has a lot of respect for him. If he comes and explains to her I feel... ... she will definitely agree. But he is sick. Let's bring the bed, sir. He is well now. Ashok! How are you Ashok now? I'm fine now. Son, I came to you with high hopes. Hope...? Usha's wedding is only four days away. Now she refuses to marry. If the Mangala Perahera stops... ... people say the girl is not right. If that happened then I would not be alive. It is a question of family honor. It is a question of family honor. Yes. It is a question of family honor. What do you think, son? If your father were alive today. He solves my grief. If I am disgraced in front of you. What will people say then? It's not just me, it's a question of your dignity. Help me, son. Keep my dignity. What should I do? Explain to her. That the Mangala Perahera should not be sent back. I don't want anything else. I will do what you want. The Mangala Perahera will not return. - Ashok. - You... Why did you come here? I misunderstood you, I came to apologize. You have dreamed of love for yourself. You broke them yourself. Why did you do that? Think of it as fate. I can not tell you anything else. Can't say the reason? Please go back. Please go back. I came here not to go back. Dad set a date for my wedding. Before someone builds an endless wall between us... ... let's get out of here. This is nothing new to you. This is how girls fall in love today. But do parents really have love? If a girl does not respect her parents... ... can never love someone else. If you really love, you have to prove it. I can even give my life. If I told you to jump into the well... I can do it for your happiness. So if you want my happiness... ... marry the man your father wants. Ashok. do not say that. Try to identify Ashok. He loved no one but you. He can not do that again. Aren't you sorry I'm in trouble? I'm smiling... ... see how you go with the swing. Now you go. Ashok. You worked all day. Is it lunch time? I will eat. I will prepare everything first. Where is the accountant? God Himself knows where the accountant is. I do not know, sir? what is this? - Are you crazy? - Everyone's crazy. Everyone is crazy. Everyone is crazy. I'm crazy about Shirin. To me, Shirin is crazy. To me, Shirin is crazy. - Shambhu. - Yes. - Looks like he's crazy. - Yes. Get him out of here. God knows what he is doing here. - All right. - Take him away. To me, Shirin is crazy. To me, Shirin is crazy. The procession came. The procession has arrived. Congratulations, Rani, the procession is a grand one. The groom looks like a stronger man. Do you have anything you want? no no. Sit here. Sit down. Who is he He was the one who taught her singing. He sings very well. He also has a handsome face. The will of God. So brother, sing a song. I'm sorry, I found it difficult to sing today. I'm not well. If not a happy song then sing a sad one. I mean, you may not find a better opportunity. that is true. There is no better opportunity than this. So what are you waiting for? What should I sing? You may have fallen in love with someone. Sing about it? To love someone. I have heard that love is bound. Ashok, do not listen to what he says. He's crazy. But I ask you to sing a song. I hope you will not refuse my request. all right. Sir, come on. Take this too. I will return your gift to you. But do not forget my thoughts. Live for love, die for love. Do not appeal to anyone. You wrote this, right? No. I wrote poetry yesterday. Understood the meaning today. Today it is very valuable. Because until yesterday it was just a poem. Today it is a life story of some people. I sacrificed my life according to your will. But I know what your situation is. You can stop your grief. But the anger in your heart is not like that. I have a request. Marry me after I leave. - Marriage... - Yes. I know there is a girl who has a lot of love for you. Who is that Do you forget Bella? what are you saying? Her nature is nonsense. That is not love. You will never recognize the love of the poor. If you want to see me happy, marry Bella. Why are you silent? Until you promise, I will not go to Dola. I will try to fulfill your request. What are you doing here? Aren't you coming to see the wedding procession? I am... He's there. Who is that You do not know. I can not say the name. Usha is leaving.

Like he... ... leaving in a wedding procession. And it's about to come. One bride goes to her mother-in-law's house. The other is close. Bella... Bella... Bella! What happened, my child? Sir! Sir, where are you? Talk to him. God knows whether he will come or not. - Bella. - You're here. Yes, I came to Bella. What happened, sir? You said Bella was getting married very grandly. Keep your promise. Decorate her like a bride. I'm making her look like that bride. Come with the doctor. Go quickly. I want to wear jewelry. You brought them for me. Did you forget? No, Bella. Then decorate me... ... from that jewelry. What else do you want? Fix my hair. - Sir. - Yes. Take a closer look. Am I like a bride? What's Bella's problem? Sir. Please do one thing for me. What, Bella? Remember the day you brought the jewelry? - Yes. You said you felt ashamed to come here. Yes. You sang a song that day. Yes, I remember. Sing that song again for me. "From my father's house..." "I have to go today..." "To my beloved home..." "I had to go." "Wear beautiful jewelry" ".I'm leaving" "The swing came..." "I'm leaving." "This is a fake residence" "That's why this thing happened to me..." "I had to leave it" "I had to go." "Beloved is standing by the door" "He came to pick you up." "Sit on the Dola" With pleasure. There is innumerable sorrow in the world. Where the trumpets are played. There may also be an atmosphere of regret. "This is a fake residence" "That's why I had to give it up." "I had to go."
