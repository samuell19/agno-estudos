(BIRDS SQUAWKING) (KIDS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Oh, haven't seen you here before. That's 'cause I ain't been here before. It's my first time. Who'd y'all come to see? Clovis Poplin. I'm his legal wife, Lou Jean. Hmm. Poplin, Poplin. Let's see. He just came from the penitentiary. Hmm. Here we go. So he did. It's here on my flimsy. Let's see what we got here, honey. Some nice goodies in here? Oh, let's see. Well, what's this? That's Texas Gold Stamps from the market. Gimme. - Oh. - Gimme. Okay, there's some more. Okay. What we got in this one? All right, Mrs. Poplin. You just have yourself a real nice visit. I think the JCs are gonna have lemonade. I didn't come for the drinkin'. No, of course you didn't. You are permitted a display of familial affection, including bodily contact, as long as it doesn't outrage the public decency. Does that mean we can kiss? If you so desire. All right, then. Oh, Lou! Ain't you somethin'? - Clovis. - Ain't you somethin'? Ain't you somethin'? - Clovis. - Ain't you somethin'? Aren't you somethin'? What's the matter, honey? Goin' shy on me? I come with the bad news. I'm leavin' you. What kinda junk are you talkin'? We are no longer man and wife. That's what I've come to tell you. I'm leaving you. I suppose that's why you brought your lunch? This don't mean nothin'. I'm already on my way. (BABY CRYING) Don't you notice nothin'? Don't you notice anything? You've gone blonde. You've gone blonde before. Clovis Poplin, have you forgotten your own son? (SIGHS) No, I ain't. Why didn't you bring him? There's kids allowed here, Lou Jean. They got candy for 'em and pop. I'm not behind bars in despair. You can bring him next time. You can bring him every week. That's what I come to tell ya. Welfare's come and taken Baby Langston forever. They're gonna keep him in that foster home! What for? Why are they doin' that? Well, how am I supposed to know? I got out of women's facility three weeks ago, and I went down to Welfare to get him back, and they made up some story, that child board made up some story. They had me fill out a statement of propriety and take it down to the county courthouse, but it was closed. And then that man on the first floor said to me that I should take it down to the hall of records, which I did, but then nobody knew what I was talkin' about. And then I remembered what you said about the telephone. So I called the man up, I got him on the line, and that didn't do no good neither because he said that the man at the first place should've already sent it to my address. But that didn't do no good 'cause I'd already moved by that time. (BABY CRYING) I want my baby back. Now, are you gonna help me or not? Well, where's he now? Over in Sugarland. But now that they got him, I just bet you those Methodists are gettin' ready to move out of state. And I wanna know if you're gonna help. Well, sure I am. Sure I am. Sure I am. Two for us and half-fare for Baby Langston. I spent $65. We're goin' to Los Angeles so you can go white collar. Bus tickets? Well, a workin' father is what that boy needs. Lou Jean, who ever gave you $65? I got to go to the bathroom. Lou Jean. Lou Jean? Honey, you gotta go next door. This here's the men's room. Prove it. (MOANS) You saved $65 all on your own? Oh, Clovis. Oh, Lord, how I've missed you. I can't wait no longer. You waited a whole year, can't you wait another four months? I can't. This is an emergency. Say, isn't this my shirt? Baby, when I leave today, you're comin' with me. Shoot! You got two pairs of pants on! I know. I got it all planned out. You're leavin' today. Mmm. I love you so much. I can't. I only got four more months. No, you're leavin' today. - Mmm. - I can't. I love you. Yes, you are. I love you too. Yes. You're leavin' today. I can't. Yes, baby. Please. I can't. Come today. Today. - I love you. - No! If you don't, this is our last time. Clovis? Jesus Christ, have you lost your brains? Hubie, you're gonna screw me up. Nobody breaks out of pre-release! That's just stupid! If I don't, she's gonna run off. Thought you said your old lady was in the jute mill. Oh, no. She's done her time and she's out on her own. Yeah, well, I'm gonna call a guard for your own good. Hey, this is stupid! Hubie! Hubie. (WHISPERING) Look, you don't understand, Hubie. They took my boy, Baby Langston. What the hell are you talkin' about, boy? Uh, guard! (MOANS) Ain't nobody gonna fuss over four little old months. Bye, honey. We won't see him for another week. I sure am gonna miss him. MAN: You might, but I'm not gonna miss him any. WOMAN: Oh, Pa, don't talk like that. - Scoot on in, Mama. - Pardon me. You Hubie's mom? Yes, I am. And still proud of it, no matter what his circumstances may be right now. Well, he's a caution, which is why we came to see him. Isn't it, honey? Sure am. Hey, uh, where y'all headed? New Frankfurt. Well, that's jus' where we're goin'! Listen, we lost our ride. Do you mind awfully? - You say you're a friend of Hubie's? - Sure am. That boy over there. He ain't no damn good. Never was no good. Pa, stop talkin' like that! And I don't think he ever will be any good. I don't know. I tried my best to make a man out of him but it look like I failed somewhere. Scoot in the seat back there. ?ndale, ?ndale, young fella. ?ndale. Yes, sir. (MOTOR CHUGS) No smokin'. Officer, I think you're a mean man. Buster, haven't I seen you somewhere before? You probably have. I think I picked peas with you out on the pea farm one time... - No. - Before you got that hogleg on. No, I think I drove you in before. Sure do. I think I took you in DWI before. Aw, you never done. I never was drunk in my life. What? I never was drunk in my life! What are you tryin' to do, make a liar out of me? (CARS HONKING) MAN: You son of a bitch! Ya ever do some time in prison, son? Sir? You heard me. Well, just a little. Yes, I did. It's all right by me. You served your time and squared yourself with the authority. What was it you went up for? I don't know, I think they said it was larceny. Say, sir, is this car runnin' right? She run pretty nice. (IMPATIENT HONKING) You look like a pea picker to me anyway. To tell you the truth, you just look like a pea picker to me. Is your name Buster Danials? Well, it was before I married. (IMPATIENT HONKING) Ooh. What kind of larceny? We were bustin' coin boxes in the washaterias. It's awful hot. You think you could go a little faster so's to cool the car off? As long as you squared yourself with the authorities, you're all right by me. Yes, sir. That all right with you, Mama? (MOTOR CHUGGING) (HONKING) (HONKING) (POLICE SIREN BLARING) Pa, you've bought it. I can see it. Man, you got yourself a real violator, huh? You ain't gonna be sick in the car, are you? Why, no! You know I'm not, man. Good. Don't let me find that seat wet, neither. Well, thank you, sir. Mr. Nocker, sir, you were goin' less than 25 miles an hour on the open highway. Not only is that a violation, but you could be a dangerous hazard to other drivers. I'm just amused. I've been an upright, and responsible citizen all my life, and I've been drivin' all my life. I'm not gonna cite you, sir, but I am gonna give you a written warnin'. That'll be okay. That'll be just fine. I'd like to take a look at your safety sticker, if you don't mind. Sure. It's plastered right on the inside of that windshield. Didn't I tell you, Pa? Didn't I tell you? CLOVIS: He's comin' over. Honey, I gotta get out, give myself up... No, it's too late! Oh, they're gonna be mad. It's all my fault. I'm gonna get another year, sure as hell. Baby, you willin' to go to the end? What you talkin' about? Do you love me? Oh, baby, we're in real trouble!

You got no idea what's goin' to happen to you. - What do we do now? - I don't know. If y'all don't give that back voluntarily, you've committed a felony. Now, all right.

LOU JEAN: What are you doing? You piece of shit! CLOVIS: Turn them lights off! All right, now let's go. That's better. You know we are kidnappers? And he's a state trooper.

(CAR HONKING) LOU JEAN: Shit! Get... You get on outta here! (BRAKES SCREECHING) ATTORNEY: All right, sir. On the day in question, how long had your man here been with the highway patrol? TANNER: It was three years, unless I'm mistaken. ATTORNEY: And during that three years, had it ever come to your attention that he was having difficulty with his vision? Any reasons to have his eyes examined? TANNER: No, sir. Don't you and the other highway patrolmen have to have regular physical examinations and examinations of your eyes? TANNER: Yes, sir. My men and all highway patrol personnel undergo a thorough medical examination every year. Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. - Captain Tanner. - Yes, sir. If you would, Your Honor. Gentlemen, we have an emergency. May I see counsel in chambers? We stand adjourned. All rise! Your Honor, may I have the court's attention? May it please the court... May it please the court? Your Honor? 2590 to Houston. This is Captain Tanner. Believe our man is hijacked. Repeat, hijacked. Have all units stay off the A channel as much as possible. There's no need of them knowing what we're talking about. I want a roadblock on 90 and Alternate at the Lavaca County line. DISPATCHER: The name of the patrolman is Maxwell Slide. He's been in uniform nine months, but he's a good boy. We can't count on him to act in his own best interest. So, in the event of a face-off, I want you to keep your shirts on. WOMAN: (ON RADIO)...are armed. Do not attempt to act with force. I see lights. A whole bunch! CLOVIS: Put that shotgun on this officer here so he knows where you're at. SLIDE: That's my captain. Don't shoot! That's Captain Tanner. You want to get us all killed. I'll put you on the radio. LOU JEAN: Yes, tell him to get out of here. We never hurt nobody. 2311 to 2590. Go ahead, 231 1. We got a 10-32 in here. Says drop off or he'll shoot. They hurt you any, Maxwell? I'm sorry about this, Captain. I had no idea they were 96s. What you talking, 32, 96? You trying to code me out? No, sir. It is merely verbal shorthand. 10-32 is a man with a gun. 10-96 is your mental subject. How do you work this thing? If you wish to talk, press the button. We ain't no mental subjects! I've done some dumb things, but I ain't a goddamn mental subject! What's your name, son? My name's Clovis Poplin, and this here's my old lady, Lou Jean. Well, what are you doing with our man in there? He's just taking us to Sugarland to get my boy Langston. You sure got a strange notion on how to hitchhike. Y'all stay back, there's no need to worry. Now you get your cars back there. Quit following us! I've got a job to do. I can't have old boys commandeering my patrol cars. What would the taxpayers say? Get on back there or I'll shoot him in the head! Now you take it easy there and think about what you're doing. No one's gonna get hurt. Do you hear me? We'll get you out of this, Maxwell. We've got a bad hombre here. We're gonna have to lift that roadblock. Houston, you let 'em all know to back off and let that boy through. (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER POLICE RADIO) Here they come. Get that car out of the hole! Hit it, Roy! Hit it! I couldn't see a damn thing! We'd better phone it in. Hello. Here, doggie. Doggie want more? Hey, boy. Piece steak. A piece steak. Baby? Baby Langston? Let's go inside and play. (CRYING) Mommy! Mommy! Please, baby. Mommy'll get you. Mommy! (ENGINE STALLING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER POLICE RADIO) You're lying! I'm sorry, sir. I'm awful sorry, sir. You had the whole thing planned. From beginning to end, you had the whole thing planned. Don't tell me you didn't have it planned! I can see you had it planned! You're dead wrong, sir. Don't tell me you didn't! You get us going! Ma'am, we're out of gas. There's no filling station anywhere nears here. Now, why don't you surrender yourselves and this thing'll end peaceful. (ECHOING) Captain Tanner? This is... You're on the outside speaker. Captain Tanner, this is Clovis Poplin speaking. I wanna talk to you. (BELL RINGING) LOU JEAN: Hey, look, they do Gold Stamps. I want some Gold Stamps. CLOVIS: Come on, Jean, you don't need no stamps. Fill 'er up? Ethyl. That oil needs checking. - Honey? - What? Now if you wanna run do something, now'll be the time to do it. No, not me. I know you, Lou. Run and do what you have to. I don't have anything to do! Shall we go, if you please? All right. How are y'all today? You want me to check that oil? Oil's okay. ...that will assist in the apprehension. LOU JEAN: (WHISPERING) I want some Gold Stamps. I want lots. CLOVIS: He's comin'. Be quiet. That'll be $7.90, please, sir. And what in the world is going on around here? Oh, I'm sorry, we can't accept these here. Better talk to the captain. Captain who? The captain? Wait! Come back here! Hold it! (BELL RINGING) Hold it, hold it! Hold on just a minute! This ain't no contract station. We can't accept your Green Card. Talk to the captain. - Talk to the captain. - You the captain? We can't accept them credit cards here. Hey, are you the captain? And if you ain't, would you please tell me where he is? - Your name, sir. - Oh, uh... Fred Mengers. Fred Mengers. I own this station right here. Do you know you just served gas to an escaped felon? Oh, you mean they were in that police car? Yes, sir. Well, I sure did, yes, sir. I'm from right here in Kildare, and I seen the whole thing happen. (TIRES SQUEALING) (CHANGING STATIONS) There. REPORTER (ON RADIO) The fugitives have been identified as Clovis Michael Poplin, 25, a convict from Crowley, and Lou Jean Sparrow Poplin, 25, an unemployed beautician from Sayers. The name of the patrolman has not been released pending notification of next of kin. The hijackers stated to Captain Harlin Tanner that their purpose was to protest the action of the Child Welfare Board which last week refused to return custody of their son to Mrs. Poplin, who has a criminal record. The boy has been living with foster parents in Sugarland. The KKOK mobile command unit is on its way for a live report. This has been a KKOK news KO. ANNOUNCER: (ON RADIO) This is the big country. It's great country. But sometimes it can get mighty hot and dry. Out here, men grow the mightiest thirsts on earth, and it takes a lot to cut it. That's why Lone Star is one of the world's finest... What they're saying is I'm an unfit mother. You broke out of pre-release? Oh, shut up and mind your own business! You broke your husband out of pre-release? What, you're assuming an awful lot for a man your size. Who said, "Unemployed beautician"? You been taking money from Donnie Hyatt? No, I quit. You got $65. You ain't never seen work. What you been doing three weeks? You've been runnin' around? - I have not! - You're lying. - I am not lying. - Don't lie to me! Don't you call me no liar! Donnie Hyatt and Bill Fails ain't running around. That's just beering. SLIDE: Suspicions of marital infidelity are, more often than not, groundless. However, the disputes ensuing are highly destructive. What do you know? Why'd you have to come along anyway in your damn police car? This whole thing's your own fault. - Now, lady. - His fault? It's your fault! Clovis Poplin, if you were half as good-looking as Donnie Hyatt, I still wouldn't quit no job for you. Not after this mess you got me in. I've stopped more marital disputes than you ever have. I've been trained for it. We're not just chasing speeders all day. I wish you'd mind your own goddamn business. What you wanna hang around Donnie Hyatt and Bill Fails for? They're just idiots. Jean, they're gonna call you promiscuous, they're gonna call you unfit. In the three years we've been married, I haven't even had the urge. And I am not promiscuous and I am not unfit, neither! Pull over here at that ARCO station. I wanna talk to that man. Well, I'll be doggoned. REPORTER: (ON RADIO) A spokesman for the highway patrol in our neighboring state of Texas admitted earlier this afternoon that their roadblock has been licked. Now your bayou-country newshounds have learned that the hijackers, a man and his wife... Admire it while you got it. 'Cause next time around, it's propane and super-slow. ...are especially well-equipped to give the police officers a run for their money. Texas highway patrol vehicles, like ours in the state of Louisiana, boast high-performance engines... Hey, Pete, these things ready to roll? They're ready when you are. Say, you been following the fun? Texas highway patrol's got their hijacker on the radio. OFFICER: Oh, the hell you say. It's no lie! I believe they're gonna talk him out of it. Where'd they be about this time? Outside of Kildare, Texas, going west. What say we just poke on up there? That's over three hours away. Just about the break-in period. LOU JEAN: "Has 3-D animal pets. Featherweight, plastic." (MUMBLING) "Nod-Away standard crib. "Four positions, adjustable spring, teething rail. "Sixteen and a quarter books." Honey, we could get that. And "Happy Hoppers push toy encourages walking activity.1-3 years. "Colored disk moves, makes popping... S-N-D." What does that mean? And we've got uh, "Animal Shop crib mobile, "one and a quarter books." And, um... Nod-Away play yard, for one book, and. um... We've got, um, honey? Honey? I got somethin' to tell ya. Promise you won't be mad? Honey? I got to pee-pee. "All-around bumper pad, one and a half books." Honey? Honey! I gotta pee! Shit! We gotta have ourselves a little talk. We gotta quit this runnin' around and start runnin'. Wha...what? You want me to go pee in the back seat of the car? All this stoppin' and startin'. We're ain't never gonna get Langston. Everything's gonna be fine. Just fine. We're in real trouble. Lou Jean Sparrow Poplin has two shopliftings and a conviction on petty larceny, for which she did eight months. Clovis Michael Poplin has four petty larcenies, two illegal entries and a conviction on burglary. He has four months left on a one-year sentence. You sure there's no armed robbery or assault? No, sir. Did they ever make use of firearms? Sure didn't. Ah, shoot. They're nothin' but a couple of kids. Hold it! You! You in the cab there! Unhook that thing, get out of here. Sit down! Sit down! (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER POLICE RADIO) Come on! Gonna drive away with her pants down? That's a nice try. God, you're not dealing with a blind man. Will you turn around and sit down? Sit down! Hold it! Hold it! (BEE BUZZING) Now, I just might see what happens if I shoot a load of buckshot in that commode! I said, I just might see what happens if I put another hole in that thing! It's only me. (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER POLICE RADIO) You gonna let him get away with that, Captain? (CHUCKLES) Well, I don't know. They thought their way out of a toilet. This old boy's some doer. They sure are messin' all over us, I know that. You got any better ideas? Yes, sir. I sure in hell do. - Hello. - ALL: Howdy, ma'am. Of course, I know why you're here, but I have nothing to say. We'd just like to see the child, Mrs. Looby. Well, of course, the child board says that the child is ours to keep now, and we love him very much, and I'm his mother. We understand that. How old is the little boy? Uh... Oh, he was two in January. We sure would like to interview him. Oh, well... Uh... Vern? Vern? Langston, do you know where your papa is? REPORTER 2: Who's your mama? REPORTER 1: Could you wave goodbye to your real mama and papa? - Can you say papa? - Are you happy? Do they treat you all right here? He's our boy now. We give him a good home. And he has all the love that he'll ever need right here. All the love, Baby Langston. (BABY WAILS) Oh, no, no, baby. Back! Back up! Back up, get closer to this thing. I can't reach over there. Now move back, get...move over here. Get closer to this thing. I can't reach it. All right, stop! We're the Poplins. Anybody home? POLICEMAN: Come on, go home! Get out of here! - Captain? - Yeah. This is Mark Fenno. - Hi, Captain. - Howdy. That's Logan Waters. - Howdy, Captain. - How are you, sir? They're Rangers. They think they can drop that old boy, Captain. What've you got there? I got a 7mm Magnum, four-power scope, Mauser action. I'll be shootin' a 148-grain bullet. At 300 yards, hit a dime. Can you guarantee Slide won't be hit? At this distance? Oh, absolutely. Well, how will I know they'll be killed outright? If it's the spasm shots you're worried about, I figure to hit the boy in the brain in the medulla and cut his motors. What about the girl? Same thing, Captain. She'll be dead before the sound gets there. Sure you don't want none? Well, maybe just one piece. A small piece though. I'm not that hungry. - Give the man a breast, Lou. - Wing or something... Clovis! Could I have some more honey, please? Want another napkin? I just wanna tell you I love you. This ain't too bad. (CHUCKLES) Hey, he's got a wishbone! Come on, Lou. Come on. I won. The kid. I don't know. I can't tell the boy from a doorpost. And we've lost our light. How you gonna score through that glass? Captain, the glass will be no problem. Don't put that stuff on me. Give me a number. I'd say it's better than 90%. (DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE) I'm gonna have to say no to you boys. Captain, that's a pretty good number. I mean, uh, we won't get a whole lot of chances as good as this one. It's not good enough. It's a long way from here to Sugarland. There's lots of possibles we haven't tried yet. I've been on the force 18 years, and it's been my good fortune not to have killed anyone in that time. That's the way I'd like to keep it. Wouldn't you know it? How do you like it? MAN: (ON RADIO) Got me a flat spot between 85 and 90. Not me. Say uh...how far to Binney? Oh, about five or 10 minutes. I don't know. We didn't pass that cutoff, now, did we? I don't think so. (SINGING) Oh, Louisiana gals, come and listen to my noise Don't ever marry them Texican boys If you do, your rations'll be Johnny cake and devil's food and sassafras tea Johnny cake and devil's food and sassafras tea (SINGING CONTINUES) (TIRES SCREECHING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTERING) Hey, how about telling me what you got in mind? Hold your butter, partner. I'm gonna 76 'em like you never saw. That's a great idea, that's just terrific! That's perfect! That's just great! Think you can do it without me? TANNER: You know my mind on the matter. At least you ought to by now. If your butt ain't sore, I don't mind tellin' you, mine is! Aren't you tired? No, I ain't. I don't see why we can't reach some kind of an understanding. Do you trust me? I'm not sayin' I do and I'm not sayin' I don't. You talkin' about not chargin' me? That I can't do, Clovis. But what I can do is make it easier on Mrs. Poplin. If she's worried about her baby, I personally can arrange a hearing with the Department of Public Welfare, so she can tell her side of the story. CLOVIS: I appreciate that, Captain. You're a man of honor, and you're tryin' your best. Don't think I don't see that. But we got other plans. Well, what are your other plans? I'd like to know. CLOVIS: We got a secret plan. Look out! (TIRES SCREECHING) Keep after 'em! Come on! Hubert, get after 'em! (SIRENS WAILING) What's in the road? FEMALE DISPATCHER: Houston, can you advise if you can release some of our units? We need them back at home. You crazy son of a bitch! You tried to rack us up! I goddamn sure as hell didn't! I been to drivin' school. And the proof is you're livin' and squawkin'. Oh, they're gonna be so mad. I really don't care. Gimme some gum and I'll drive all night. Don't stop for nothin'. Then don't call me no son of a bitch! Clovis, honey, don't. It don't do no good runnin' from a tornado. Who else is out there, Ernie? The Lord only knows, Captain. Well, call 'em all in. All except highway patrol out of Region 2. If I can't call him by his first name, I don't want him out there. Yes, sir. I want a helicopter. A helicopter with a searchlight. And I want some kind of a spot to hem these old boys up. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Come on now. Move on down here. That's it. You're good. Real fine. (CAR HONKING) (HONKING CONTINUES) Where the hell they all comin' from? (SIREN WAILS) (CARS HONKING) Have you heard anything from our unit? No, sir. They are still out there? Yes, sir. In fact, the whole state of Texas is on APB alert. The whole state of Texas is here. We got lawmen from Dallas, up from Austin. If they was all dentists, we could call this a damn convention. Has the chopper come up with anything yet? Nothin'. Just a couple of kids hole-punchin' back of the schoolyard, that's all. Have you located this old boy's folks? Both mother and father dead. Do we know the girl's maiden name? Sparrow. (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) SLIDE: (WAILING) Help! Clovis Poplin! Somebody help me! Hey, help! I don't believe it. Man, these cuffs hurt! Are you Mr. Sparrow? Okay. This way. That's some ride, huh? TANNER: Mr. Sparrow, your influence might persuade your daughter and her husband to give themselves up. Otherwise, I fear not only for the safety of our man but, frankly, for their lives as well. Now do you understand why I have to say that? Yes, sir. All right, sir. Whenever you're ready, you just press this black button down here. And talk in a normal tone of voice. When you're ready, just... Talk in a normal tone of voice. Yes, sir, and press... Press this button and talk in a normal tone of voice. That's right. Now you want me to go ahead? Yes, sir. And then just say whatever you think's right. Lou Jean? Lou Jean? Lou Jean! This is your daddy. They brought me down here in a helicopter that I might say a word, and I'm gonna. It's a good thing your poor mother is not alive to see what has become of you. Lou Jean, you're no good! And I always knew... (STATIC) If this man gave me a gun, I'd go down there and shoot you and shoot that trash you married. God'll get you. (STATIC) (CAR DOOR OPENING) Hi, there. Here, take this. Put this around ya. It'll make you feel better. You tired? I sure am. It's not every day I hitch a ride like this. (STATIC ON RADIO) Hey, you're not altogether bad-lookin'. You married? No. Got a girl? Of course I do. I bet she's nice. - Well, good night. - Lou Jean... Yeah? Could you turn off the police radio? Why, sure. Great. (SWITCHES RADIO OFF) - Lou Jean... - Yeah? I know you're all right and a good woman at heart, even though, uh, you might have took a wrong turn in life. Well, thank you, I'm sure. Prison made a woman out of me. Night. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) Jean? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Got a gas stove. God damn! (CHUCKLES) (CLOVIS CHUCKLES) (LOU JEAN CHUCKLES) (LAUGHING) Hey, we got a free movie next door. Oh, Lou, honey. If Baby Langston was here, we'd be a real family. What if we don't get the baby? Of course we're gonna get him! That's why you stole that old police car, ain't it? I guess it is. You guess it is? I guess you're right. Come here. Did you miss me? Every day. I like to hear you tell me that. I missed all that sweet talk. I wish we could get drunk. We always used to get drunk together. You're fun drunk. Except when you're throwin' up in the back of Bill Fails' Chevelle. Jean, I mean every word of this. You're my wife and I love you, even if we don't get the baby. Wish we had sound. I'll be your sound. Come on. Come on. (MIMICS ROADRUNNER) (LOU JEAN GIGGLES) (MIMICS STEAMING) (BOTH LAUGHING) (LOU JEAN LAUGHS) LOU JEAN: Oh, no! (LAUGHS) (THUD) (SNEEZES) (CLATTERING) Oh, boy, that kid! How many times have I told him! (CLATTERING) What are you doin' in that outfit? We're not goin' to the mountains. Oh, yeah. Just a precaution. See and be seen. There'll gonna be a lot of clowns out there with firearms and itchy fingers. I don't want to get shot. Well, Patty, you trying to be a reserve officer like your old man? Nah, I want 'er full time. You'll make it. - Did you bring the coffee? - Black and hot. Great. Did you do that? I had to. You're in real trouble. Thank you. Jean, you decent? Propane. Nice. Y'all decent? I'm gonna go pick one out. Don't you guys get to dawdling. (WATER RUNNING) Does that old razor belong to you? Sure do. Wanna use it? Yeah, when you're done. (FLUSHING) How much money you make on the highway patrol? Not a whole lot, let me tell ya. Yeah? How much is that? $620 a month. But I take home a whole lot less. (ELECTRIC RAZOR BUZZING) So, I didn't mean what I said. What was that? About callin' you a son of a bitch. I didn't mean that. And you ain't no mental subject, neither. I've been thinkin' about gettin' on the highway patrol. (WHIRRING STOPS) They won't take a man with a record. I think it's a state law. Hmm. LOU JEAN: Honey, I found a... ...blue Cutlass. Oh, I love it! (RAZOR WHIRRING) Honey? Just supposin' that I were to tell you that this is the end of the line. Just supposin' I told you I wasn't gonna go no further. What? Just supposin'! Now, you may kill me, but if you don't come to your senses and throw it down, they're gonna kill you. Well, supposin' I was worried about that. Which I'm not! And supposin' I was to give myself up. How many years' do you figure they'd give me for breakin' out? Now, I couldn't tell you, but it might go real easy bein' as how you're a regular fella and all. Well, I am a regular fella! I never shot a man. There you go! That's a major point with the law. Make you mighty happy, I bet ya. (LAUGHS) Hell, yes. It'd make everybody happy! LOU JEAN: Well, where are you two? It's already sunup. Not Lou Jean. It wouldn't make her happy. Man, they'd lock me up from now to Moses. Take away my boy for good. They'll change his name. All right, stand up. Stand up! Nobody move. I made up my mind. We're gonna take this one. It's the best one on the lot. Don't let that squelch fool you. We're not the only ones out here. Maybe they already caught 'em. No way. I had my home set on all night. Wasn't anything on the APB about it. (CHUCKLES) You all know what I think about the Airborne. Dad, they're in Big John's! After you get the insulation scraped off, you bring it from your hot line to your coil over here. Make sure you don't get your fingers on the metal. I need somethin' to short over the starter. What about your badge? Yeah, that'll work. You got water in the gas line. You all been running lights and appliances all night? - LOU JEAN: No. - CLOVIS: Yeah. Battery's outside. Which one do you want? I'll take that redhead. (LOU JEAN SCREAMS) Come back! There! There! Come back! Come back here! Come back here! That must be them, all right! (BOTH LAUGHING) (GUNS FIRING) (GLASS BREAKING) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Hold it! Maxwell, come back! Wait! Come back! Wait a minute! You son of a bitch! Make 'em stop! (GUN COCKING) Stop! Hold your fire! This is Patrolman Slide, Texas Department of Public Safety. How do you work this goddamn thing? (SQUEALS) SLIDE: No! Lou Jean, turn it around! (SHRIEKS) LOU JEAN: Captain Tanner! Captain Tanner! They're shootin' at us! This is Captain Tanner. Where are you located? We got 'em! Big John's used car lot, Military Drive! Hey, we got 'em! They're at Big John's used car, Military and San Pedro! (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (SIRENS WAILING) (GUNS FIRING) Hit anything yet? (YELLING) Boy, wait till they see what we found. Drop those weapons! Move a finger and I'll blow it off. But, sir, we've captured the fugitives. - Keep 'em here, Jessup. - Yes, sir. CLOVIS: (OVER LOUDSPEAKER) Captain Tanner! Captain Tanner! You're gonna kill your man! I'll pull my trigger, I'm gonna shoot his head. Now, it's him for my baby. That's my deal. Clovis, I see you. That's my deal. Now, what kind of a deal are you talkin' about? We keep right on to Sugarland, no roadblocks, and no snipers, and no nothin'. Once we get my baby, I'll let your man go. Now, are you listenin'? 'Cause he's gonna tell you somethin'. This is Patrolman Maxwell Slide. I suppose y'all might want to end it right here and now. If that's your thinkin', sir, it's fine by me. Y'all come on in. Just tell everyone I told you that. Let's all back off a step or two, men. There's no need for hasty talk around here. All right, Clovis. You got yourself a deal. Sounds like a fair proposition to me and I'm gonna abide by it. No more runnin' off, no more speedin', and no more guns. Now, what do you say to that? CLOVIS: I want your personal word of honor. Do I got it? Yeah, you got it. Did you hear that, honey? We're gonna get the baby. Captain Tanner, I do believe you're a good man. Captain? Yeah? You ain't really gonna let 'em take that baby, are you? I don't see how we can. Well, uh... Do you want me to go somewheres? Yeah. Go find those two old boys that was with you. What's their names? Fenno and Waters. Yeah, Fenno and Waters. Find them, take the chopper, and get on over to the foster home. Yes, sir. (KEYS JINGLING) I'm real sorry, Captain. Yeah. Don't let me see you around here again. - But, Captain... - Shut up! These boys ain't no reserves. They ain't been on the active list for more than a year. Is that right? (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER POLICE RADIO) Take that with you! Arrest 'em, Jessup. Yes, sir! (BELL TOLLING) (DOGS BARKING) (BABY BABBLING) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) You're not gonna take him away, are you? No, ma'am. Just gonna make sure he'll be safe, that's all. (SINGING) When my blue moon turns to gold again When the rainbow turns the clouds away When my blue moon turns to gold again I'll be back within your arms again I'm sittin' too far from the wheel. No, sir, that's the way it's supposed to be. Simply place your hands at 10 and two o'clock. Like this? That's just about okay. Now, when negotiatin' a turn, shuffle the wheel through your fingers, rather than to go across hand over hand. That way you got both hands on the wheel at all times. (SINGING WITH ABANDON) CLOVIS: That's pretty neat. Hey, have you ever seen a picture of Baby Langston? Ain't he sweet? Yeah. Fine-lookin' boy. I took that picture. It's a fine-lookin' picture. This here's my ma and pa, Horace and Mavorene Slide. Hey, you got your pa's eyes. Who's that they're standin' next to? My bull. I was in the FFA. Who's that, your girlfriend? No, that's my old girlfriend, Donna. I still got the cycle. What's that? No, no. Gimme that! That's mine! What's that? Is that you? Is that you? Is that you? Yeah. (LOU JEAN SQUEALS) Looks just like you. I bet you're gonna get a big promotion when this thing's over. You're gonna be Lieutenant Slide. That'll be the day. (CARS HONKING) Hey, looky up there! CLOVIS: Now, what do you think of that? (HONKING CONTINUES) (CROWD APPLAUDING) Could I have that? Could you bring that here to me? You got to count to 10. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ew! God! - Let me see. - Nuh-ah! Hey, could you do me a favor? Anything you want, child. Could you get me some hair spray? Some hair spray and a set of rollers. You wait right here. Now, you just wait right here. And could you bring some pins also, and some other junk? You just wait. And could you bring me some lipstick, pink, frosted? You wait now. Here you go. Maxwell Slide, there's my picture. That's an old mug shot of me. Ew, I look like shit in that picture. You look more like a convict than I do. It's Patrol Academy. It's worse than jail. It's your baby. Don't let no one take him away from you. I'm not gonna. Thank you, and I wanna thank you for everything you've done. - Sure. - I appreciate it. Y'all take care now. Bye! CROWD: Bye! (CHEERING) (HONKING) Now there's another town between here and Sugarland. I don't want any more rubberneckin'. You two go around to Rodrigo and make sure the local man's got the streets cleared. If he tells you it's the 4th of July, you advise him otherwise. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. (CARS HONKING) Wanna set up some sandbags? We won't need 'em. We're gonna need a little more room in here. Get that chair out just a little bit. Can you gimme some breeze? Ma'am, are you expecting a delivery of diapers, or milk, or newspapers, anything like that? No. Are there any neighbors or kinfolk who might get it into their minds to pay a visit? No. We could get a head shot from there. We better plan to shoot on this side of that post. Okay, let me check. Take a heart shot right at the top. Excuse me, ma'am. That looks all right. - You think that's gonna work? - It'll work. You all right, sir? Officer, I know you're not gonna let me shoot the son of a bitch, but at least you can use my rifle. (HUMMING) I don't know how this is gonna look. You should always wash it first. (CONTINUES HUMMING) Christ! (COUGHING) How ya'll doing? Could I ask y'all some questions? Hey, y'all be careful. How they treatin' you, Mr. Slide? They've been all right. When you gonna make your escape? I'm not gonna escape. I'm too busy talkin' the man out of it. Yeah, he's talkin' see, but I ain't listenin'. Hell, you ain't. I've practically got him rehabilitated. I wouldn't go that far. I feel I'm just being reasonable. TANNER: You in the rig there. You've got one second to get out of there. I wanna say that I appreciate what Captain Tanner's done... What would you two charge for an exclusive, in-depth interview exclusive with my station? Cash money? Hey, don't nobody want to ask me nothin'? (SIREN WAILING) Okay. Now, we're not gonna talk to any more reporters till we decide on our deal. Right. Whatever you think's fair. That's right. Okay. TANNER: All right. I've been advised we got innocent civilians all over the streets of Rodrigo. I can't let you go on in. I want you to pull over and stop so's we don't have an accident or worse. Pull over and sit while I find a way around that town. What's he thinkin' of? So what if there's people? I wanna see the people! I like the people. I wanna see 'em. And I bet ya $10 the people are gonna wanna see us. Now let's take a vote. Everybody who wants to go through say "aye." Raise your hand. I raise my hand. Aye. Y'all go on in if you have a mind to. Come on! If you're in favor, raise your hand and say "aye." Aye. Captain Tanner, this is 2311. Go ahead. We all decided to go on through. Thank y'all for makin' it unanimous.

Well, for reasons of safety, we're transferring them over to the courthouse. That's where we'll make a transfer. Transfer'll be made at the courthouse? That's right. Right out front. Harvey, what you doin' over here from Houston? Well, if you're gonna stick around, you might as well do it inside. I knew it. They done Terrible Ted the same way. (INDISTINCT TALKING OVER POLICE RADIO) (BAND MUSIC PLAYING) Remember back in the car lot... Hey, listen, we're gonna keep this newspaper. I hope you don't mind. Could you sign somethin' real nice right there? Listen, this here's my card. Maxwell Slide, phone and address. I sure would like my car back after all this. Honey, come on. Let's go. Well, Captain, looks like we made it in one piece. Looks that way, son. You still want your baby? You still want your patrolman? Listen to me, Clovis. We've come a long way together and you know my intentions have never been other than decent. Now whether you realize it or not, I know what's best for you. So I'm asking you, please get out of that car and get into mine and let me take you home. I know I gave you my word and all, but I'm still a duly constituted peace officer of the state of Texas. What he's saying is, he might not be able to keep his word. I'm happy with the deal we made. All right. Your child, Langston Poplin, is in the foster home with his foster parents. You just go on over there and they'll give him to you. LOU JEAN: You tell them I know where it is! Let's go! Okay, now, hold on a minute here. We gotta get somethin' straight here, Captain. Go ahead. I want 15 minutes while I go in and get my boy. You got it. And I wanna go in private. Y'all hang right back here. All right. We're not movin'. I'll just park here so no one gets by me. That's real fine. There's nothin' else I can think of. I guess it's goodbye. Come on, Jean. Clovis, if you don't mind my asking, what's your plans after you pick up Baby Langston? I guess I can tell you now. We're only a few miles from Mexico. Jean's got a cousin in Mexico City. We're all gonna go down and live with her. LOU JEAN: There it is! There it is! CLOVIS: Yeah, I see it. I see it. Don't stop! What was that? What are you doin'? That was it! Do you hear me? (INSISTENT HONKING) Stop that car! It's all wrong! Just look round you, for Christ's sake. You heard what the captain said. I'm beggin' ya, hand me back my gun, and in the name of God, let's quit. Now you open your door and you step out real easy. Then we'll go get my boy. Clovis... He's not in there. Ain't no way in the world I'm goin' up that path. Oh, God. It's true. He ain't in there. Baby Langston! Baby Langston! SLIDE: We need to get outta here. Baby Langston! Baby Langston! CLOVIS: They took him away, baby. They took him away. I hear him. He's cryin' for his mama. Sit down. Just sit down! Jean... Jean, honey, they took him away. What's the matter with you? You get out there! You go get him! You lied to me. Go get him! I can't do that! - You promised! - I can't... Get out there and get him! I'm gonna get him. No! - Yes! - No! Lou Jean, get down. I'll take the girl. Get down. Get yourself down! Clovis! Damn that banister. God damn. The tree's in the way, Fenno. - No, he's goin' back. - He's goin' back? Yeah. I can get him easy but it won't be clean. Take that goddamn window out! Don't hit Slide! (SIRENS WAILING) MAN: Yee-ha! (BABY SQUEALS) You okay? Yeah, I'm all okay. What'd they mean, pullin' a stunt like that? Y'all better pull over. Pull over. Pull over and let me look at you. How about all them crazy kids? Do you have a match? Take me home now. (CRIES OUT) (LOU JEAN SCREAMS) Do you have a match? My wife's so loud. (LOU JEAN CONTINUES SCREAMING) (SIREN APPROACHING) (ENGINE HISSING) (MOANS QUIETLY) I suppose you'll be wantin' that. He took my gun but he wasn't gonna use it.
