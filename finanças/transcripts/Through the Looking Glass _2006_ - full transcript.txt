Well that’s why you always ended up in detention and I got away with it. No I ended up in detention because I didn’t like their rules. I just like to do things my own way. You always were a stubborn bastard, Ray. Even that art teacher told you that remember? That’s why he got paint all over his car. Ah, yeah. I hated school. That’s because you were never there. Too busy painting even then. It just seemed to get in the way of what I really wanted to do. Naw, it wasn’t like that for me. So I didn’t go. I didn’t need to.
