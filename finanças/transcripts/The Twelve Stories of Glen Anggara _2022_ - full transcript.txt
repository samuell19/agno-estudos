-What a loser. -You're a moron. Being a moron is better than being single. Shut up. Welcome. BASED ON THE NOVEL BY LULUK HF Rian. Who is the kindest among you? Did she just come here and… Just answer the question. -Me. -Me. Of course me. How about the richest? That's definitely me. Right? -Him. -It's him. I'm not bragging, but look at how I dress, how clean my skin is and my complexion-- And who's still single? Can't you tell from the emptiness in his eyes? And the emptiness of his heart longing for a woman's embrace. Thank you. Fine, you're the winner then. I won! I'm single and I won! Your prize is to become my boyfriend. Become her boyfriend? You're kidding, right? Does it look like I'm joking? This girl is crazy, confirmed. Her name is Shena Rose Hunagadi. She was a senior in our high school. She's short-tempered and vicious as a wolf. Is this your ancestors' school? Sorry. Your apologies fall on deaf ears. If I whisper it, it'll sound better. Come here and show me. It hurts! Yes, it sounds better. Say it again! Do squat jumps! Do 20 squat jumps! But she's also beautiful. Like Princess Elsa from the movie Frozen II. If it isn't us, who will keep our school clean? If we don't care about the environment, we won't mind littering at school. As president of the student council, she always inspired us to do things that we wouldn't even think of. From now on, if you litter, you're dead! YOU LITTER YOU'RE DEAD! Stand up! You litter. You're dead! -Do you want to be my boyfriend? -Why would he refuse? You've always had… He always had a crush… Why should I do that? Because I'm giving you a chance to become a good man. I can do that without being your boyfriend. Are you sure you'll pass? I'm going to count to three. One… Two… Three. Okay, time's up. Are you mad? You've forgotten your feelings for her? -I still want to be single. -You were obsessed with her. You're just playing hard to get. I'm just not ready for any relationship. I think she's also insane. She wouldn't pick Glen if she was sane. Right? Scoot over. Where have you been? -I have something for you. -What is it? Do you have the same cap with my name on it? And what do you have for me, Amanda? I have an apple for you. She knows my favorite fruit. It's as sweet as you. Have a bite. I'm full. Drink this veggie juice. It's bitter. Bitter is good for your health. Too much sweet things in your life is bad for your health. Diabetes alert. Are you hoping your son has diabetes? No, sorry, you're not my son. I can't convince you to go to college. If I go to college this year, I'll skip many classes. I'm not ready for college. I just graduated. Not school again? Rian and Iqbal don't have a problem with it. They go to college just fine. They're just paying their dues. They don't genuinely enjoy it. And you genuinely enjoy doing nothing? Tulus is doing something. He's a famous singer. That's not funny! I thought kids your age were so eager to pursue their dreams. Currently, I don't have dreams. I just want to be happy. How can you be happy if you don't achieve anything that you can be proud of and make people proud? Glen, come here. We need to talk. Yes, Dad. I'm coming. You promised me you're going to talk about college with Glen. Yes, dear. Meng, did I scare you? Come here, baby. There you are. Poor kitty. Did Mommy scare you? Or did Glen scare you? If you keep pushing me, then you're asking for trouble, Dad. -I'm not scared of you. -Bring it on. Is that how you talk to your father? Come here! Is it broken? As a husband who really understands his wife and as a good father to his son, before we start this discussion, let's not forget I was so-- Poor. But with hard work, you became rich. So you and Mom don't want me to be miserable. But we've spoiled you rotten. You're now ungrateful. Thank you, God, for letting me be born into this family. I'm not joking, Glen. Your mom and I aren't going to live forever. You have the freedom to choose your future. Things you have right now won't last forever. Damn, what my dad said got me thinking, thinking about my future. And the conclusion? It kept me up all night and gave me migraines. Why must you make the sambal yourself? Because I've been thinking all night about eating this fruit salad with Iqbal. Are you having cravings? Are you pregnant? Watch your mouth! Pregnancy is only allowed after legal marriage. Legalized by your religion and the state. Have a taste. Good, right? Not bad. What is your dream for your future? My dream is to become Iqbal's wife. -You set the bar too low. -What? It's not too low! Becoming Iqbal's wife is not easy because he's diligent, smart and independent. And if I want to be his wife, at least I should have the same energy. It's hard! -It's just one slice of cucumber! -No, they're for Iqbal. That's why you should have a girlfriend. You'll know how it feels when she makes you a fruit salad and you're the first person who gets to eat it. Fine. -Iqbal! -Is that the fruit salad? -Yeah. -Let me taste it! -Feed me. -It's there. No, I'm going to feed him. Are you jealous? Here you go. -Is it good? -It's good. -I know, right? -It's delicious! Iqbal, what's your dream? My dream? I want to be Acha's husband. What? You're going to say his bar is also too low? I'm not saying anything. Glen, she sets a high standard for a husband. I have to be smart, diligent and independent-- And love me very much. How about you? What's your dream? I have two dreams. I want to be Acha's husband. Or Iqbal's wife. Throw it. I can't believe you two. You don't have to stay, Glen. If you have other things to do, you may go. I'll be fine. Mr. Anggara. -Dr. Andi. -Apologies for the wait. It's okay. Is this Glen, the kid who fainted when he saw blood? What college do you go to? What major? Business? Management? I mean the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Just like my daughter. She's in medical school now. Exactly. But in Glen's case, he has too many considerations. You're right, Dad. Do you have the lab results with you? Glen! -The lab results. -Yeah. Here you go. -Please come in. -Okay. Dad. I'm going to go buy some snacks. I'm a bit hungry. -Okay. Take care. -Okay. Oh, no. Did she just… Why are you following me? I thought you jumped… Or did I interrupt you? Don't do it. Life is hard, but suicide is a mortal sin. You'll go to hell. You won't like it there, but you can't leave either. It sucks, right? Stop being so dramatic. I'm not suicidal. -Then what are you doing here? -I'm checking my laundry. And what are you doing here? Adjusting the TV antenna. That's a lame one. I'm glad you rejected me. That would be your loss. You lost the opportunity to have a rich and handsome boyfriend. Excuse me, but there are many men who are richer and more handsome. That would be my gain. I feel sorry for them for having you as their girlfriend. You're such a drama queen. You pretend to be cool and quirky! And now you're pretending to pass out. You're a walking cliche. I know you want me to help you. Excuse me, but you're not fooling me. Hey, Shena! Stop your acting! It doesn't work! Shena! Shena! Shena! Wake up, Shena! Shena! What is that? Shena. Wake up, Shena. Please, wake up! Shena. Help! Somebody, help! Who's down there? Wait for us! Is this Glen, the kid who fainted when he saw blood? Thank you for helping my daughter, Shena. What's wrong with Shena? She's suffering from kidney failure. Son… My name is Glen, ma'am. Glen Anggara. Glen. She has been undergoing dialysis two times a week in this hospital for a year now. But I just found out that for the last two weeks she… And today she tried to run away again. She was lucky you found her or she would've been… Oh my God. This hospital has been helping us so much with minimum billing, but we still can't afford it. Shena, my love, I know you don't want to be a burden, but I'm going to work hard to pay for your treatment. Good afternoon, Mrs. Huna. -Good afternoon, Doc. -Glen? You're still here? He's the boy who saved Shena's life. -So you're the one who fainted! -Just for a few minutes. -I'm going to check her condition. -Please. Go ahead. The dialysis helps her kidney get rid of toxins from her blood and regulate fluid in her body. It's not intended to treat her renal failure. So she could die at any time or day? So can everybody. I thought a kidney transplant can help? It can, but it's not an easy process. It's expensive and you need to find a matching donor. Not to mention a long waiting list. With her condition right now, she desperately needs a friend like you. I'm going to go in now. Sir, you dropped this paper. I picked it up just in case. -Thank you. -Excuse me. To whoever finds this letter. Apparently life never goes as we plan. There will always be surprises that forces us to abandon all of the plans we've made. They could be pleasant surprises or unwanted surprises. Sometimes we try to hang on, but sometimes we just want to give up. When it happens, we start to regret things we didn't get a chance to do. I'm going to write down 12 unfulfilled wishes from my bucket list. One, I want to have a boyfriend. -Do you want to be my boyfriend? -Why should I? Because I'm giving you a chance to become a good man. THE TWELVE STORIES OF GLEN ANGGARA You're so quiet today. Mom, Dad, is it okay if I want to be a good man? Who wants to have a bad son? Hold on. You want to be a good man? Yeah. That's an improvement! Yesterday he just wanted to be happy. And today he wants to be a good man. We have to celebrate it! Let's drink to that. To Glen Anggara. Honey, raise your glass. Mom. To being a good man. You're lacking a lot. Lack of a girlfriend. Lack of dreams. Lack of activities. Too much hanging out. -I need to ask you something. -Sure. If you found out that Acha has a terminal illness and is counting her days-- What are you trying to say? Just thinking about it suffocates me. Rian will answer your question. I'm going to get coffee. Only after you buy me a skin for my mobile legends. -No problem. Done. -Okay, shoot. If Amanda only had a short life to live, would you do anything she asks? -Yes. -Okay, thanks. Later. You asked us to come here just to ask that? Yeah, and you convinced me of what I should do. Are you leaving already? So, who's dying? Meng. My mom's cat. The cat has 12 wishes on its bucket list. I'm going to make them come true. Just a bite. Shena. What are you staring at? Dr. Andi said I can go home now. Thank goodness. Let's go home, then. Yeah. -Let me carry the bag. -I can do it. -It's heavy. -It's not. I can do it. Okay. Bye, everybody. Are you lost? -I think so. -Are you looking for someone? Shena. Do you know her? I do! Come with me! This is her house. You can go in. Thank you. You're funny. I want to be your boyfriend. The offer is no longer available. -Wait, Shena! -What? I want to be your boyfriend! Who is that, Shena? -A mad man. -What? A madman? It's Glen! How did you get here? I used GPS. When she was in the hospital, I inserted a chip inside her body. I just followed the blinking red dot, and here I am! -See? I told you he's mad. -He's funny. Don't just let him stand there. Come on in. What changed your mind? -Because-- -You feel sorry for me. Yeah, I feel sorry for you. You're dying and never had a boyfriend. How do you know? -Of course I know-- -How do you know that I'm dying? Only a suicidal person can write this kind of letter. -I said I didn't have a… -Glen… I can only serve you this hot tea. -Here you go. -That's perfect. Bitter news can only be cured with a sweet drink. Enjoy the tea. I have to go to work. Back to the hospital? No, I have a second job at the laundry. You're a poster mother. I didn't know working was your hobby. It's not a hobby. It's a necessity. Not everyone is privileged like you. Stop it, Shena. I'll see you guys later. Peace be with you. I am going now. Peace be with you too. Take care, Mom. That picture's title is You can see it in her cheerful expression, big smile and spirited eyes. This one was taken at my grandfather's villa. She was standing between her doting parents. And this picture's title is It was taken when she found out something was wrong in her body. Her expression is no longer cheerful. The big smile is gone and her eyes look sad. She feels lost. She has no idea if she has any future. And the next one is-- Shena, The Thorny Rose. "You litter. You're dead!" You've finished your tea. You may go home now. Forget my letter and my offer. So now you're rejecting me? You're denying me a chance to become a good man? Shena. Allow me to help you make your 12 wishes come true. You're so full of yourself. -You sure you're capable? -I'm willing to try. As long as I can, I'll make it happen. -Okay, what if I wish for lots of money? -How much? -If I wish to go to the U.S.? -When? Go to the moon? What is there to see? You'll only find stones and sand. Just want to make sure you're reliable. I don't want you to quit in the process. I, Glen Anggara, swear to help fulfill all of Shena Rose Hunagadi's dreams. And I swear I will not quit, even if she wants to go to the moon. Well? Do you accept me as your boyfriend? Yes! Now, since we're now dating, what's your second wish? I want a romantic proposal. -But we're already together. -Can you do that? A romantic proposal? Okay! Inhale. And exhale. Let the air flow throughout your body. Teach me how to propose to a girl. -Who's the girl? -I'll tell you later. I just need tips for a romantic proposal. Any idea? Switch the foot. Rest your elbow above the knee. Stretch your spines. Feel your muscles… You better ask Iqbal or Rian. Are they romantic? -Nope. -Nope. Extend your legs forward. Lie down slowly on the mat. Close your eyes. How do you want to be proposed to? I want it to be on the lake. Both of us on a boat. Everything is so peaceful and suddenly he holds my hands. Then he tells me how much he loves me. How about you? I want it to be up in the clouds. -How come? -Because we're in a hot air balloon. And I see "I Love U Acha" written on the clouds. And also "I Want U Acha." You're not in the JKT48 girl band. Wait, what's the next pose? Mom! Mommy! Don't fall asleep, guys! Next pose, extend your arms forward. Well, Glen? Any ideas for a romantic proposal? Just be yourself and express your true feelings to her. She's right. Women love simple and meaningful proposals. She's different. She loves romantic stuff. Acha, do you still want to borrow my clothes? -We do. Right, Amanda? -Pick which one you like. Let's go! Just kidding. Glen, I'm so happy you joined our yoga session. Why don't you invite Iqbal and Rian too? The more the merrier. Yes, Auntie. What are you watching? Korean drama. I love this one. It's so romantic. Really? If Indonesian men could be as romantic as men in Korean dramas, the world would be beautiful. -Want to watch with me? -Sure. Let's share earphones. It's so sad. Mom, can we borrow these ones? So sweet. What's wrong with you two? Now I know how to make a romantic proposal. I love you, Shena! You're so cheesy. Just forget about our agreement. I don't wish for a boy like you. What a bummer! You're mean, Shena. No, I'm not. -He's been waiting outside your house. -For an hour. -Two hours! -No, it's more than two hours! He didn't knock immediately when he got here. Just pacing in front of your house. Yeah! Why didn't you just knock at my door? I don't know how to properly do it. I want it to be really romantic. I understand the theory, but not so much in practice. Do you think what he's doing now is romantic or not? Romantic! I love you, Shena! If you think this is not romantic enough for you, then I'll think of another way-- Are you ready to hear my third wish? Wait for me, Shena! Shena! Shena! Shena! Shena! My dad said… we can see the end of the world from here. My dad used to work here. He brought me here every weekend when I was little. -What did you do? -Watch the sunset. Shena. Can we watch the sunset while sitting? My arm is numb. Fine. Glen. Yes? Fourth wish, right after this. Shena, I don't think I can handle your fourth wish. Can we skip it? Or make another wish? Shena, I can't! Glen. If you can't handle it, it's okay, you can leave. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. I will wait outside then. Why are you back? If I can't look at your blood, can I look at your face instead? No one is forcing you to look at my blood, Glen. Thank you. Thank you. Here you go, Glen. -Thank you. -I'm going to leave you two. Sorry if we can only serve you simple meals. When I was in school, Miss Wati's fritters were my favorite. You can only eat that? Don't feel bad for me. Eat your food. -But-- -Mom. -Glen doesn't want to eat. -I'm eating! I'm eating! It's so delicious, ma'am. Glen. Are you ready for my fifth wish? What is it? You want me to kiss you? No! There's rice on your lip. Damn you, rice! You got my hopes up. My fifth wish is… I want a romantic dinner. A romantic dinner is not about where or what's on the menu. It's all about your dinner companion. Acha and I can have a very romantic dinner even when we eat street food. Who's your date anyway? Shena. Do you really like her or do you just feel sorry for her? I feel sorry for her. And you're willing to grant all her wishes based on that? Yeah, I want to be a good person. -She's taking advantage of you. -I know. She already said it. She wants a kind and rich boyfriend. -That's not fair to you. -It's fair enough for me. -She's inspired me to be a good man. -But… Forget about it. I have to pick Amanda up. Can you help him clear his mind? I give up. -Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. Why is he mad at me? It would make more sense if you truly loved her. I don't have any feelings for her. Then you have no problem. If she wants a romantic dinner with you, who she knows is rich, then she wants to eat at a fancy restaurant. That's romantic to her. Don't forget to buy her an expensive dress, purse and shoes. All of it. Today we're going to learn about the triangle. First, equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle has an equal length on its three sides and has the same internal angle. So if you see a triangle like this, what do you call it? An equilateral triangle! And if you slice the triangle this way… it's called an isosceles triangle. You're all so smart! What's wrong? I'm okay, dear. I want you to write it down on your notebook and memorize it. Where are your friends, Santi? An equilateral triangle has an equal length on its three sides. Angle A is green, angle B is blue and angle C is red. Which angle do you like the most? The blue one. Okay, it's blue! An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. What's your shoe size? -5.5. -It's 5.5. Shena! Where have you been? And what are these? They're all gifts for you from the "I love you" man. A driver will pick you up at 6:30 p.m. Glen will be waiting at the restaurant. I love you, Shena! Glen. You… look different. You too. The food here must be very expensive. One of the most expensive in Jakarta. But it's recommended as Every dish has good reviews. Many important people eat in this restaurant. And you need to book in advance or you won't get a table. What's wrong? Isn't this what you want? Did I miss something? I like this place. It's just… This is… too much for me. I don't mean to be ungrateful, but I feel like I'm… taking advantage of you. What do you mean? I'm happy doing all of this for you. Because you feel sorry for me? This time, it's not just that. I also want to experience a romantic dinner with a girl. This is the first time for me too. I was so nervous. I was afraid you'd hate it. I love it. Don't cry then. Let's order. Waiter. Do you have anything that's not high in phosphate such as dairy, grains, processed meat, legumes, chocolate or tomatoes in it? Do you want anything in particular? Drinking water, maybe? -Miss Wati! -I'm coming! Is it really you, Glen? I couldn't believe it when you called me. I thought you had forgotten about me since you graduated high school. I will never forget you, especially your fritters. Is this Shena? The student council president? You're so beautiful. Sorry for visiting this late. It's okay. Your fritters are waiting for you. But I don't think you can eat it inside. My house is too small. But don't worry. I prepared a perfect spot for you. Follow me. Let's go. Here you go. Watch your step. Since it was on such short notice, this is the best I could do. I hope it's romantic enough for you. Here's your table, your flower and your chairs. So sweet. -Thank you. -My pleasure. This is all I can serve. The special order. Fritters for Glen in every flavor. And apples for you, Shena. Do you have rice? -You want to eat them with rice? -Yeah, with rice. Sure. Hang on. Maybe just a piece? It's so tempting. Fine, just a piece. -It's amazing! -I know, right? It's really amazing. Glen. Thank you. This is the best romantic dinner I've ever had in my life. I will never forget this moment. The rice is coming. Here you go. You're the weirdest boy I've ever known. The only one who eats fritters with rice. There. In Sundanese we call it sangu. Like Adele's song, "Sangu One Like You." If you need anything, call me. Anything at all. -Okay. -I'll leave you to eat. Thank you. You're still up? Yeah, I think I ate too many fritters. Why are you in your storage room? Storage? I'm in my bedroom. What? -It's so messy! -Really? But it's comfy. Comfy or lazy? Lazy. Clean your room now. That will be my sixth wish. I want you to clean your own room. No, don't waste your wishes on wishing me to clean my room. I don't mind. But do it now. -Can you help? -Okay, I'll help you. Where do you want to start? Your clothes. They're everywhere. Arrange your books. Done! Shena? Shena? It's not intended to treat her renal failure. So she could die at any time or day? So can everybody. Shena. Wake up, Shena! Shena! Are you okay? Oh my God. Sorry, I fell asleep. So, where were we? What's wrong? Nothing. -Did you cry? -No! No. Wake up, Glen. Glen, do you know what time… Honey! Honey! Honey! What is it? What is it? When did he start cleaning his own room? And he woke up earlier than me. -Yeah. -Yeah. There's something wrong with him. This is so unlike him. Or maybe he's doing drugs! Please, that's nonsense. How about you make us breakfast? I have to get ready for work. Okay? Yeah, do that. I'm going to get ready for work. Come here. Let me fix your tie. I have so much old unused stuff. How about I donate them to kids who might need them more than me? Dad! Mom! Yeah, that's a good idea. Right, honey? Honey? Honey! -Honey! -Yes. I agree with you. Are you sure you're not in some kind of trouble? No, Mom. I'm thinking about cleaning the attic too. There might be some old stuff up there too. I can donate them to poor kids. Are you okay? Poor Mom. Are you tired? You should be home right now, resting. -I'm bored. I want to help you here. -I don't need your help. Dr. Andi said you can't get tired. Now, sit down and let me continue my work. Wait here. -Have fun, Mom. -Sure thing! The rainy season is coming. It's going to be messy again. Rain is a blessing. It's good for our business too. I'm talking about flooding. With all the clogged sewers? It's surely will hit our block. What can we do? We can only pray more. Don't worry, children. Everybody will get one, okay? -Who wants this? -Me! -How about this one? -Me! This is the side effect of cleaning my room. This is my old stuff. They need this stuff more than I do. -What do you have in there? -Lots of stuff. You're right. -Who wants this? -Me! Me! Glen. I know what I want for my seventh wish. Rose Squad from block 03/08, are you ready for your task today? Are you ready to clean our neighborhood? If it isn't us, who will keep our neighborhood clean? If we litter, that means we don't care about the environment. Do you want your house to be flooded every year? No! Do you want our neighborhood to look dirty and ugly? No! Then what are we waiting for? Let's clean our neighborhood and spread the message of our campaign: "You litter. You're dead!" Go, Shena! Pizza! Pizza! Who wants pizza? Ma'am, want some pizza? Pizza time, kids! Are you sure you don't want pizza? -Want some pizza, Santi? -No, thank you. Kids, it's fritter time! Fritters, guys! Come and get it, kids! Wash your hands first! Go wash your hands first! Plants are here! Here's one for you. Let's go. And one for you. This one is a special one for you. It's beautiful. It has a special spot now. -What was your order, Iqbal? -Orange juice. -Thank you. -You're welcome. I can't believe him. Since he's with Shena, I can't reach him. Good for him. He has activities now. But I miss him… when he's not around. Rian misses him too. He just doesn't want to admit it. -It's not what you think. -Then what? Shena is taking advantage of him, and he doesn't even realize that. How about we order food? -What do you want to eat? A sandwich? -Whatever. Are you mad at me? So this is what it feels like to be tired, but also excited. Look, Shena. What if your arm goes numb? Not this time. Glen. Yes? My eighth and ninth wishes are meeting your family and friends. Yeah, I'm here. I'm on your porch. I also couldn't believe it when Iqbal said he wanted to major in medicine. How about Glen? His "major" is testing our patience. Angela can be so sensitive. She'd be upset if we ignored her. Never known a cat like that. Shena. The party is in the backyard. Glen, you said Meng is four years old, right? I got her a tutu. It's not an expensive one, though. Oh my God, did I forget to tell you? -Meng is actually-- -Your sister. I know. Yes, but she's not human. She's a cat. -Thanks anyway. -A cat? Mom, Dad. This is Shena. She's my girlfriend. -Hello. -Hello, Uncle, Auntie. So you're the girl who turned him into a tidy boy. I'm glad he finally has a girlfriend. No. That's not what I meant. I'm so glad he has a girlfriend like you. At least I hope he can decide what to major in this year. I'm not going to lie. An unemployed boy who only eats, sleeps and plays games can be such a burden. What a headache! If you break up with me for the burden they put on you, I'd understand. He's not a burden to you, right? I'll try my best, Uncle, Auntie. But we can't promise anything, Uncle, Auntie. Please excuse us. That's the reason it took me a while to introduce you to my parents. See how they delegate their parental obligations onto you. It's not your job to educate me. It's theirs, right? I know, but they're so funny. It's adorable. -Listen to your parents. -I know. Shena, I want to introduce you to Acha, Iqbal's girlfriend. And that's Amanda, Rian's girlfriend. They helped when I ran out of ideas about how to grant your wishes. What wish are we at? It's my eighth and ninth wish. My eighth wish was to meet his parents, and my ninth is to meet you guys. Cool, we're in Shena's bucket list. I know. You were so popular at Arwana High School. So three more wishes. What are they? -Don't know yet. -You don't need to know either. It's none of your business. I'm curious. Once you've granted all of her wishes, then what? Is she really going to, you know… Stop it, Rian. And then what? She'll make Glen grant her an extra wish? He's going to spend the rest of his life fulfilling her wishes. I wouldn't do that to him. You wouldn't do that to him? Because you're going to find another rich boy like him to fulfill your next 12 wishes? Is that it? Enough, Rian. Stay out of our lives. I'm your friend. I'm happy you have a girlfriend, but not like this. Calm down. Stop fighting. She's taking advantage of you with her fake illness. She's not faking. Many are ill. None of them are as high-maintenance. -She's dying. -How do you know she's dying? Because she said so? She just wants you to feel sorry for her. You got fooled. Stop it. Rian, we're guests here. Meng is a cat, not a human. I'm leaving. You can stay. Rian! Shena. I'm sorry for what he said. He always talks without thinking. He just doesn't care about her feelings. I can't imagine feeling sick every day. Sorry, I know you didn't expect this when you imagined meeting us. But that's exactly why I did this. I want to know how you guys feel about my relationship with Glen. It's okay if you feel sorry for me because Glen feels sorry for me. That's why he's willing to help me make all my wishes come true. It's okay, Shena. Every time I go to sleep… I always wonder… if I'm going to wake up the next morning. What if my mother goes to wake me up and she finds me dead? Shena. And every time I wake up the next morning, I think about… how long I have left… with my loved ones… and friends such as all of you. Thank you. Thanks for staying with me to this day. You can quit whenever you want. But can you let me stay until the party's over? Because birthday parties have a deep meaning for people like me. So who should get the first slice of cake? The first slice of Meng's birthday cake is for her beloved brother, of course. Glen! Thanks, Meng. With Meng's permission, I'm going to give this cake to our new family member, Shena Rose Hunagadi. Thank you, Meng. Let's take a family picture. Let's go, Shena. One, two, three! I'm so happy to see you both at the party. What a cute couple. It reminds me of your dad and I when we were so deeply in love. But actually, we're just-- No buts. I don't want to hear it. Love is love. I know how you feel. Your dad can feel it too. We know that you're in love with her. Keep the fire alive to make it last forever. Who knows, one day you could follow our examples. Mom, Shena is… What about her? Nothing. Thanks, anyway. I'm going to drive her home. Sorry if I hurt your feelings. You're the luckiest person in the world. I don't need to talk about your wealth. But I'm talking about the people around you. You have great parents. They love each other, so in tune with each other. You have friends who care about you. They truly care about you. -But Rian is-- -He cares about you the most. -He's the most honest. -I don't like the way he cornered you. I'd do the same if I were him. I'd wonder once all 12 wishes come true and I'm still alive, then what? I'm going to make 12 wishes for you to fulfil in return. -Why so? -So we can stay together. Shena. I really like you. Your acting is so convincing. -But I'm-- -You almost fooled me. -I'm not kidding! -I don't wanna hear it. You're my boyfriend. We don't have to make it official. But this time it's different. My heart is ready. I really do love you. Your acting is so convincing. Now you can stop it. Shena! Shena! Shena! Shena. Are you okay, dear? What is it? Please don't be mad at me. I lied about the last lab results. You're in the final stage of renal failure and it's causing complications in your other organs, especially your lungs and your heart. Shena. I want you to stay strong. Don't give up. We're going to find the best treatment for your illness and we'll keep doing dialysis and others treatments. You have to stay strong. Mom. I want to stop the dialysis treatment. I don't want to do it anymore. I'm tired. That doesn't mean I'm giving up. I'm not a quitter. But I know I don't have much time left. I want to thank you for being so strong and very supportive. It's you who keeps me strong. Can you do one thing for me? Of course, dear. Thank you. Forgive me, Mom. GLEN, ARE YOU READY FOR MY TENTH WISH? BRING IT ON. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. Peace be with you! Shena! Shena! -Hello, Glen. -Do you know where Shena is? She was in a hurry this morning. So, no class for us today. -Thank you. -Okay, bye. This one is a special one for you. It has a special spot now. -Nurse. -Can I help you? Do you have a patient named Shena Rose Hunagadi? I don't think so. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Shena is very sick. She's sick? What does she have? Acute renal failure. Why didn't you tell us earlier? If she needs money-- She asked me to keep it from both of you. Let's visit her. Where is she? I don't know where she is. And she doesn't want to see me anymore. Meng, I miss her. I feel sorry for Glen. He must be very concerned about you. I think he has to know about your current condition. I'm sure he'd want to stay beside you. I just want to be with you. The only one I love. Don't you love him? Glen's mom has been asking us multiple times to talk to him. It's useless. He'll never forget her. I think she put a spell on him. What's wrong with you? We have to help Glen find Shena. I just don't understand why he let himself be fooled by her. I know I'm stupid. But you two were once stupid when in love, right? Wait, Glen. Wait. Sit down, and let's talk. You should be glad. She finally realized how bad she's been fooling you. Stop talking shit about her. I'm just pointing out facts that you stubbornly refuse to see. -Are you crazy? -You don't know anything about me! Since she entered my life, I know what I'm going to do every time I wake up in the morning. She inspires me. To become her slave? Even Genie refused to be Aladdin's slave. And he only granted him three wishes, not twelve! That bitch! She told me you're the friend who cares the most about me. You're the most honest and you speak the truth, even if it hurts my feelings. But she's wrong. You just love to see me as a loser. You love to see me suffer. Let me go! -I just-- -He's right. You're such an asshole. Your boyfriend is in there. -Did you pick a fight with Glen? -He randomly took out his anger on me. It's not random. You hurt his feelings. He was happy with Shena. -But-- -No buts! Do you even realize we are his best friends? But-- You're so busy feeding your own jealousy that you stopped caring about others. You're pathetic. -Are you sure she will show up here? -She has to. She needs the dialysis. I know you must be hungry. Acha, Iqbal. Want some donuts? -You want one? -Later. Thanks. I know I wasn't being a good friend. I'm sorry. Stop sulking. You have to eat or-- I don't like peanuts. I want the chocolate one. But that's mine. Is your apology even sincere? Okay, fine, take this. Do you want me to feed you? I changed my mind. Okay, here. So, do you forgive me or not? A little. Glen. Yes, Doc? Can we talk alone? Follow me. Shena asked me to not let anybody know about this. Even her own mother? Doc. Is she okay? If you don't tell me the truth, I'm going to stay here with my friends. Glen, her condition is worse than you think. Her renal failure has reached the final stage. It's affecting her other organs, especially her lungs and her heart. She doesn't have much time left. She got so depressed when she heard the news. And you were right. She was contemplating suicide. But she became more cheerful with you by her side. Do you know where she is right now? About that, I have no idea. You've helped her so much. You should go home. Your parents are concerned about you. They called me and asked me to talk to you. Glen. Tell us. Where is she? He doesn't know either. She doesn't have much time left. And now I'm scared of losing her. We have to find her. Where do we find her, Rian? Even Glen doesn't know where to look. Acha. If you were in her shoes and you didn't have much time left, where would you take me? I love historical spots and places full of good memories. So, I'd take you to a place where we had many memories together or a place I often visited when I was little. I went to the port where she used to go with her father. She wasn't there. Any other places? This one was taken in my grandfather's villa. Villa Matahari, Cipanas, 2015. I know where she is. Where? -Glen? -Come on! Get out. Now what? Are you trying to keep me from finding her? That's not my intention. You've been up all night. You're tired. It's dangerous. I'll drive. -Come on. Get in the car. -Let's go. Let's go, Rian. Let's go, guys. Don't worry. I'll take you anywhere to reunite you with Shena. -Thanks, Rian. -No problem. The GPS shows that we're almost there. Turn right up ahead. This is it. This is Villa Matahari. -That one? -Yeah. Glen, remember. Women love to say no, but deep inside they mean the opposite. -You're not coming with me? -This is your moment, Glen. Don't forget. Fight till you die. Glen, make her smile. That's the most important. And make it a special memory for both of you. I don't have any advice for you. I just want to say… that I'm happy for you. We're just going to drive around this area and find a place to rest. Call me if you need anything. Good morning, Mrs. Huna. Good morning, Glen. Is Shena okay? She's fine. I'm so glad you're here, Glen. Is she here? Yes, she's in the backyard. -I… -What are you doing here? I want to see you. Didn't I make myself clear when I said I don't want to see you again? I'm still bound to my promise to you. I still haven't fulfilled your last two wishes. Don't bother. You failed to fulfill my tenth wish. I did. You left me and said you don't want to see me again. So what I'm doing here now has nothing to do with that wish. Because I'm the one who came here to see you. I'm the one who wants to see you. Because I missed you so much. I fell in love with you. You're talking nonsense. Do you even know what you just said? Why would you fall in love with a dying girl? You're still alive. But I will die soon. I will leave you forever. And… it hurts! I'm scared, Glen. You have me, Shena. I'm scared of leaving my mother because she'll be alone. I'm scared of leaving you because I'll make you sad. I know it will affect the people I leave behind more than me. Enough, Shena! Now is the time for you to choose whether you want to spend your remaining days being afraid or being happy? Being happy. Now tell me your 11th wish. It's your chance now. Use me. Take advantage of me. I'm here to make all your wishes come true. Promise me you won't laugh. I won't laugh. Don't tell me I'm cheesy. I won't say you're cheesy. This is my 11th wish. I want to get married. Don't laugh. I'm just smiling. Is it good? Hang on. Someone's calling. -Is it good? -Yeah. Hey, Rian, I need a favor from all of you. -Tell me what to do. -Can you all come back to the villa? And bring party decorators, cooks and a professional photographer. Are you planning a party? It's our wedding party. -What? -I almost forgot. Get me a suit. A nice one. -Glen. -But, Glen… My mom wants to talk to you. -What's up? -They're getting married. What? Married? Mom. -I'm going to be upstairs, getting ready. -Okay. Sit down, please. Shena told me you said yes. -Yes. -Aren't you're too young to get married? Do you really feel you're right for each other? How do your parents feel about this? Where do you want to live after getting married? Who's going to feed the family? How much do you earn? Those are questions you have to answer one day when you find the right woman and you're ready to get married. I don't understand. Getting married has been her obsession since she was little. It's not because she wants a husband or she wants to create a family. She just wants to experience the wedding ceremony, like the one we had. She just wants to wear this wedding dress. I told her that she could wear my dress on her wedding day. That's why I brought the dress all the way from Jakarta. That's all I want to say. So you can make everything clear to your parents. Yes, ma'am. Where do you want the wedding organizer to start working? The ceremony will be in the backyard. -Okay. -Thanks. Let's go, Rian. Acha, can you help Shena's mom get ready in her room? -Where? -In her room. -Okay! -Thanks. You're welcome. We rented suits to attend your wedding. We got you a few suits to choose from. Pick the one you like the most. -Thanks, bro. -No problem. Iqbal, what are they doing here? Yeah. They can act as the invited guests. The more the merrier. Well? Okay, but your tie needs to be straightened. Honey, here's the dress. It's so beautiful. I love it. Thank you, Mom. Check, one, two… Okay. The MC is ready. The music is ready. The food is ready. The groom is ready. Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom are here. Glen Anggara and Shena Rose Hunagadi. Let's give them a big applause. Now what? Next. How about we ask the groom or the bride to give us a little speech? Here you go. Thank you. Here, you speak. First… I'd like to thank my mother… for being strong, so patient with me… and so full of love. I wouldn't be this strong without you by my side. Thank you, Mom. Also, I want to thank… Iqbal, Rian… Amanda and Acha. Thank you for being such good friends to me. Thank you for being here… and for making me happy today. I'm so lucky to have you guys. And last but not least, a special thanks to… Glen Anggara. Thank you for giving me this moment. Thank you for making all my wishes come true. Thank you… because you've made me feel what I've never felt before. That… means a lot to me. Thank you… for being… my… -Shena! -Shena! -Shena? -Are you okay? Call the ambulance. I've got everything ready inside. Hurry up, Iqbal! Ma'am… why don't you take her to the nearest hospital? I promised her. Whatever happens, I have to take her to the hospital she feels like is her second home. -Mom. -Yes, dear? Thank you for being so kind to me. Yes, dear. Thank you for keeping your promise. Yes, dear. I'm so proud of you. You're such a strong girl. Please don't be sad. Glen. Yes, Shena? Can you take care of my mom? Thank you. Yes, Shena. If we still have time, let's chat again like we did before. But now I just want to go to sleep. Rest, my love. Glen? Shena. -Let's go. -Where? I want to go to the place where we first met in this hospital. -But, Shena… -It's okay. Don't do it. Let me pull it out for you. Are you sure? Yeah. Can you really do it? Yes. Bear with it. You're no longer afraid of seeing blood? No. It's beautiful. Let's sit here. Finally. Thank you, Glen. What are we doing here? I want you to make my 12th wish come true. What is it? Break up with me. Say it now. "Shena, I want to break up with you. This is over." No! I won't say it. Why not? You promised you will fulfil all my wishes. -But not this one. -Why not? You will feel relieved if you break up with me. You will have no burden. You can find a healthy girlfriend who can grow old with you. Just be honest with me. Do you want me to break up with you? No. Why not? Because I fell in love with you. Thank you, Glen, for everything you did for me. Well, not everything. You still have one wish left. The one about breaking up? Shena! Well… Sitting here with you… is enough for me. Come here. Are you okay if I sleep? I'm tired. Sure, you can sleep. Sweet dreams. Don't wake me up. I won't. But tell me if your arm goes numb. I will, Shena. Glen… don't be sad. You're just going to sleep. Why do I have to be sad? Promise me you won't cry. I promise I won't cry. Thank you for everything, Glen Anggara. You're welcome, Shena Rose Hunagadi. Shena. Shena! Is she okay, Doc? -Is Shena okay, ma'am? -She's gone. Shena, wake up! She's gone. She's already gone. No, she said she just wanted to sleep. -Yeah, she's sleeping. -Please wake up, Shena. Bye, Shena. I love you, Shena! Thank you for making all my wishes come true. Before your wedding ceremony at the villa, she asked me to give you this letter. Thank you. I'm ready to make your 12th wish come true. Mom, Dad, I've chosen a major. Public Administration? Do you want to work for the government? I just realized that I love making people happy. I want to focus more on serving the community. You can still serve your community by taking another major. But if I become a subdistrict head, a regent or even a governor I can make policies that are pro people. Our neighborhood is flood-free now! It's all thanks to what? "You litter. You're dead!" That concludes my proposal for our future business. -What kind? -Any type of hospitality service. Weddings, birthdays, circumcision, even funeral services. What should we do? We're going to make their 12 wishes come true.
