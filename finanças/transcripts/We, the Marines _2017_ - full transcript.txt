[Rooster crows] [alarm beeping] - - [footsteps] - - [dogs barking in distance] [door closes] [microwave beeping, whirring] [door opens, closes] [water running] [microwave beeps] [footsteps continue] [microwave door opens] - - [plate scraping] - - [microwave door closes] 7:30 in the morning, and today is the day that I have been kind of dreading since April, but, um, my fiancé Sam enlisted into the Marine Corps, and he leaves for boot camp today. Um... You, too, honey. You take care. Thank you. Grandpa. Take care, big guy. Good morning. Aw, you. [♪♪♪] [Gene Hackman] These young men and women are going on a long journey. I love you so much. Mm. We all love you. I'll miss you. - [Hackman] - One that goes around the globe and back to the foundations of our nation. [Whimpering] - [boy] - Bye, Daddy. [Man] Bye, honey! Love you! [Man] Go, go, go, go, go, go! [♪♪♪] [man] Move, move, move! [Explosions popping] [♪♪♪] ♪ All we've ever needed ♪ ♪ Is a montage ♪ [man] Hands up! ♪ Whoo ♪ ♪ Whoo ♪ Get those knees up! Keep 'em up! - [Hackman] - People say that the Marine Corps is different from all other military organizations anywhere in the world. [♪♪♪] [Hackman] I'm Gene Hackman, and I was a Marine. Once you're in the Corps, you're in the Corps all your days on Earth. Why is that? The answer starts when the Marine Corps was founded, in 1775. [Horse trotting] [Hackman] needed sharpshooters The Continental Navy to give their frigates an edge over the superior English Navy. [Explosions, gunfire] [men shouting] Marines picked off dozens of the enemy seamen, in our nation's first battles at sea. Without these first Marines, our nation might not have been born. Today, the men and women of the United States Marine Corps are ready to go anywhere on a moment's notice, to fight if need be, and to help where help is needed. [Man] All right, Marines! [Shouting orders] [Hackman] Marines are fiercely loyal to each other, always moving, thinking and feeling as one. That's what our motto, "semper fidelis," "always faithful," really means. That's why you never stop being a Marine. [♪♪♪] [men shouting in unison] But committing to the Corps is not for the faint of heart. [Bus engine slows] [brakes squeal softly] [Hackman] or in San Diego, At Parris Island recruits always arrive for the 12-week boot camp at night. [Man] Get off my bus! Now! Now, now, now! I said get off my bus! Move it! Move it! Eyes on footprints! Eyes on footprints! - [Hackman] Some come from - families with long traditions - -of serving their country. - - [All in unison] Aye, sir! - [Hackman] - Others come from tough places, where it's hard to find work. [Instructor shouting orders] But they all arrive looking for direction to their lives. To better themselves. It all starts when you step onto the footprints where generations of Marines have stood. [Woman] Some of us are right out of high school. Some have never been away from home. Just coming here takes courage. - [Man 1] You got to - put your feet on the floor. - [Man 2] Aye, sir! - - [Clippers buzzing] - [man 1] - You got moles to report, too, let me know where they at. - [Barber] - Let's go, sir. Feet on there. Get your feet on, get it on there. - [Man 3] - Yes, sir. [Clippers buzzing] Move faster! [Indistinct shouting] Now, boy! - [Hackman] Then the recruits - begin their training, - by meeting the person - who will scare the living civilian out of them, their drill instructor. [All in unison] Yes, sir! Now stand right here! All right, sir. "Aye, aye, sir!" Aye, aye, sir. Help her! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Yes, sir. [Indistinct shouting] Aye, sir! [Man] And he's tough, but I can tell you, he's instilling not only physical toughness but mental toughness. [Indistinct shouting] [Hackman] Believe me, it ain't no walk in the park. [Grunting] Go! Go! [Grunting, panting] [indistinct shouting] - [woman] - You learn never to leave - -any team member behind... - -You got him! Pull! ...under any circumstance. - -Push! - -Come on! [Shouts] - [Hackman] - At boot camp, we determine what young men and women are made of, whether they can adapt and overcome. - [Man] Don't look down. - Don't look down. - [Hackman] - If they have what it takes to earn the title Marine. We learned lessons from past wars, like World War I, where at Belleau Wood, in France, our Army and Marine Corps - -faced new weapons... - - [rapid gunfire; Men shouting] machine guns, aerial bombardment and chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are still a threat, so we train for them today. [Filtered breathing] [indistinct shouting] [coughing] [Hackman] Recruits are told to unseal their mask - so they can learn - how to clear out the gas. [Gasping] I can't breathe! [Hackman] It's nasty. [Retching] I can't... [grunting] [indistinct shouting] [coughing] [Hackman] Over the 12 weeks of boot camp training, our goal is to become an integral component of our team. [Hackman laughs] We start out pretty ragged. Oh, yeah. [Indistinct shouting] [♪♪♪] - [woman] - But just a few weeks later, - we've ironed out - most of the wrinkles. - [All in unison] - Yes, sir! [♪♪♪] - [Hackman] - To be true to our heritage, all Marines train for combat. Every Marine is a rifleman. [Distorted gunshot] All Marines learn to shoot with precision at long distance. [Distorted gunshot] - [woman] - Yes, ma'am. [Indistinct talking] Yes, ma'am! [Indistinct talking] Yes, ma'am. [Indistinct talking] Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. [Hackman] If boot camp is a series of character tests, you could say they saved the best for last. [All] Yes, sir. - [Hackman] - Few things are as memorable in a Marine's boot camp experience as the rite of passage called the Crucible. It's 54 hours... 48 miles of marching, 45 pounds of gear, and 29 intense team-building exercises, all with only six hours of sleep - -and two meal rations to go on. - - [Officer] I told you to go! Get through the obstacle! - [Man] - On day one of the Crucible, I kept telling myself, "I've got to finish this." - [Officer] - What are you doing, soldier?! - [Man] And during - those grueling 54 hours, I learned one thing above all... We can do this... together. [Indistinct shouting] [grunting] [♪♪♪] And when we do... it'll be the hardest thing that we have ever done in our lives. - [Officer] - Let's go! Help each other! Work as a team! [Hackman] We learn to lead and to count on each other. [Recruit groans] The Crucible emphasizes our motto... Semper fidelis, always faithful. We can't make it alone. We need each other. [Andra Day] ♪ All we need ♪ ♪ All we need is hope... ♪ [officer] Push. Push. [Groaning] ♪ And for that we have each other ♪ ♪ And ♪ ♪ We will rise, we will rise ♪ ♪ We will rise... ♪ [woman] We all started this journey together, and we are all going to finish it together. ♪ We'll rise ♪ ♪ I'll rise up ♪ ♪ Rise like the day... ♪ [Hackman] Then... we're done. ♪ In spite of the ache ♪ ♪ I will rise... ♪ Present... arms! ♪ And we'll rise up ♪ ♪ Rise like the waves ♪ ♪ We'll rise up ♪ ♪ In spite of the ache ♪ ♪ We'll rise up ♪ ♪ And we'll do it a thousand times again... ♪ - [Hackman] - You've earned the Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, and a handshake of congratulations. - [Officer] - Job well done. [Hackman] At that very moment, you become a Marine. [Soft crying] It's a moment you'll never forget. - [Man] When you go on - that final motivational run with your battalion, you realize you're part of something bigger. [Crowd cheering] ♪ And I'll rise up ♪ - -♪ I'll rise like the day ♪ - - [excited shouting] ♪ I'll rise up... ♪ - [woman] - Oh, I'm so proud of you! ♪ I'll rise up ♪ ♪ And I'll do it a thousand times again ♪ [laughter] ♪ For you, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ For you ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ You, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ Made it.

[Marching footsteps] [soldiers chanting] [chanting continues] [Hackman] So if you think officers have it easy, think again. [Yelling, grunting] The Quigley exercises. - [Laughs dryly] - Oh-ho... Its name alone makes officers squirm. It's snakes in the summer, ice in the winter. [Man] Putting us through that culvert with a D.I. yelling at us in a confined, muddy trench, I don't think that that's anything that any of us will ever forget. [Hackman] The officers are ready. Now it's time to really go to work. - [Indistinct - military radio chatter] - [Hackman] All across the world, - Marine Corps operational units prepare for deployment to anyplace on Earth. [Radio chatter continues] At Camp Pendleton, Marines train to go in fast... By air, from the sea, and across the land. Marines are a triple threat. In one of the greatest battles of World War II, Marines stormed the beachhead at Iwo Jima island. While the first Marines landed, the enemy hid in caves and tunnels, - waiting for the right moment - to strike back. Then... all hell broke loose. [Bombs whooshing] [explosions, gunfire] - -Many became heroes that day. - - [Indistinct radio chatter] At the top of Mount Suribachi, Marines raised the Stars and Stripes, boosting morale for all of our troops and creating the immortal image known around the world. Since Iwo Jima and other island campaigns in the Pacific - -in World War II, - - [indistinct radio chatter] we've developed better ways to get ashore. A Landing Craft Air Cushion, LCAC, can carry vehicles and Marines even up over land. [Indistinct radio chatter] [man] We need fast, long-range planes that can collect people and equipment without an airfield. That's the Osprey, the V-22. - [Hackman] The Marines - are always devising new ways to get troops where they need to be, and get them out safely. [Soldiers grunting] The training exercises across Marine Corps bases and stations encompass every type of a Marine, including the four-legged kind. [Dog panting] Loyalty is the hallmark of the Marine Corps. And who's more loyal than man's best friend? - [Man] - When a handler and a dog - -become a team... - -Up, up. Up, up. Up, up. - ...they must first establish - a fundamental level of respect amongst each other. The way you do that - is by simply spending time - with each other and letting the dog be a dog around you, then slowly incorporating commands as you go along. [Speaking German commands] Good. [Man] The reason training is happening every day is because the bond is constantly being developed. - And that bond is - what saves your life when you're downrange. Forward. Hop up. Forward. Easy. Aw, yeah. That's a good girl. [Man] What's so beautiful about the bond between a handler and their dog - is that you can communicate - without saying a word. - [Hackman] - Today, military working dogs are trained at Camp Pendleton to detect bombs and prevent terrorist attacks. Search. [Barks] Search. - [Hackman] Villages have been - built to simulate other parts of the world. That's a good boy. They look and sound authentic. They even smell like the real thing. [Man] This dog lies down and wags its tail when it finds explosives. - Dogs have a better record - of finding explosives over anything else, even fancy electronic equipment. Good boy. [Man] We love our dogs. We'd risk our lives for them. And vice versa. - [Hackman] - In Vietnam, more dogs were deployed in combat than ever before. [Barking] Over the course of this long war, it was nice to see some familiar faces from home. Folks like Bob Hope. [Laughter] - [Bob] - And I want to tell you, folks, these Marines are really tough. [Cheering] - And their motto is - "semper fidelis." - That means, - "Oh, don't worry about it, Doc, just nail it back on." [Laughter, cheering] [man] It was a difficult war, but getting a letter from home meant everything to us. [Indistinct chatter, laughter] It's these moments that remind us what we are protecting. [Hackman] The Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport was founded in 1951 to train Marines for Korea. Months after North Korea invaded the South, - a Chinese communist army - swept in, encircling the 1st Marine Division at Chosin Reservoir, just as a brutal winter set in. Our troops were surrounded and badly outnumbered. Despite frostbite, hunger and exhaustion, the Marines carried their wounded with them, as they fought their way 90 miles to the sea. [Wind whistling] To prepare for harsh cold-weather conditions, like those faced in Korea, Marines train high in California's Sierra Nevada. [Yells] [Hackman] It's cold. - [Laughs] - Oh, yeah. - [Man] - All right. [Speaking indistinctly] 6851. [Speaking indistinctly] - [man 1] - It's not just about being able to jump into a frozen lake, it's being the sort of person that can deal with anything without fear. That's the sort of person that you can send anywhere. [Wind whistling] [man 2] Here, we think about a winter in Korea. - Having to deal - with that kind of cold, - I think, - is something I won't forget. [Hackman] In the mountain terrain at Bridgeport, we also learn to climb and rappel. [♪♪♪] - [man] - Having to create your own one-rope bridges and-and jump in freezing water, it's just some of the best training, most dangerous training we did. [Hackman] But it comes with consequences. If you have a fracture there... [Hackman] The training is realistic and tough. - - [Groans] - - [man] Yeah, it's painful. [Hackman] You won't forget it. [♪♪♪] [man] We train to get into places quickly. - We need to be able - to get ready in a few hours at a moment's notice. We don't choose where they send us. [♪♪♪] [officer] Go! [Man] It's literally a leap into the unknown. It's a different sort of courage, dangling there in the dark, not knowing what dangers are ahead. But what we do know is that we are part of something bigger, more important than just us. - [Hackman] The Corps - trains Marine air crews to go in first, fast and undetected. The best pilots are put through an intensive seven-week training course. When Marine infantry units call in an air strike, precision is vital. ♪ Lonely shadows... ♪ The latest laser technology has made this teamwork more accurate than ever. ♪ Lonely voices talking to me ♪ ♪ Now I'm gone, now I'm gone ♪ ♪ Now I'm gone ♪ ♪ And my mother told me ♪ ♪ Son, let it be ♪ [rapid gunfire] ♪ Sold my soul to the calling ♪ ♪ Sold my soul to a sweet melody ♪ ♪ Now I'm gone, now I'm gone... ♪ [rockets whooshing] ♪ Lord, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Lord, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Lord, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Burn, burn, burn... ♪ - [man] - When they're on the ground and they see our gunships in the air protecting them, they're telling us thank you every day. ♪ Sold my soul to a sweet melody... ♪ [Hackman] When it's time to move, the CH-53 does the heavy lifting. ♪ Lord, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Lord, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Lord, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Burn, burn, burn... ♪ - [Hackman] Midair refueling - is the modern equivalent of jousting, except a lot more's at stake if you don't hit the bull's-eye. - [Female pilot] - 0-1-1, Iron Horse 2-1. We've got a good flow. [Male pilot] Copy. Good flow on starboard hose. [Hackman] Helicopter crashes can be deadly, especially when water's involved. So some Marines now train to escape from a submerged helicopter, upside down.

[Hackman] We do it three times. The third time, it's blindfolded. [♪♪♪] We also train to provide humanitarian aid to other countries around the world. We're America's international 9-1-1 responders. [Labored breathing] When there's a disaster, we're ready. [Wind whistling] - [man] - As the Philippine government ask us for support, - I've got airplanes - that can look for people in areas that are stranded. That's what I do. [Indistinct chatter] - [Hackman] - Marines rushed to help in Japan when a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck. And in Haiti, after the earthquake. And in Nepal, where six Marines lost their lives when their helicopter crashed in bad weather. Marines are ready anytime. Several times a year, we gather to coordinate the capabilities we've trained for in a combined arms exercise in Twentynine Palms, and at other bases nearby. It's a dance. And the Combat Operation Center is where the dance is choreographed. - Charlie 1-1, - this is actual. Mission is a go. I say again, mission is a go. [Indistinct [military radio chatter] [Hackman] Their mission is to land a battalion of Marines in a small desert village with integrated air and logistics support. Now the dance begins. [♪♪♪] - [man over P.A.] - Ship is in flight quarters. - All hands not involved - in flight operations, stand clear of the flight deck. [Jet engines whirring] - [Hackman] One of the most - critical components of this dance is the fire support, which prepares the objective before we put boots on the ground. They have a language all their own. [Indistinct shouting] Fire! [Indistinct [military radio chatter] There should be three positions. - [Hackman] The Marines - always say that no plan survives first contact. - [Woman] - Instructors will throw a wrench in our plans, - so we'll know how to deal - with the unexpected. - [Man] - Thunder 4-1, immediate cast. Stand by for game plan and eyeline. [Pilot] Thunder 4-1. Ready. Copy. - [Hackman] Mortars protect - the approaching assault. Fire! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Hackman] This training has been essential in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since the beginning of the Global War on Terror, the face of combat has changed. - [Man] - We no longer have - -an enemy that wears uniforms. - -Fire! - We don't have an enemy that, - uh, has a state capital. - We don't even have an enemy - that has a state. [Soldier] Get over here! Come on! Come on! - [Hackman] In one block, they may - need to assault a building. [Rapid gunfire] And on the block right next to it, hand out bottled water and packaged meals. It's not just about using force, - but also making and keeping - the peace. At the end of a combined arms exercise, you work on ways to do it better as a team the next time. [Man 1] The difficult you'll do immediately, - and the impossible - just takes a little bit longer. And the Marine Corps taught me that... Nothing was impossible. [Man 2] We are ready when others are not. - That's why we're committed - to each other and to our core values of honor, courage and commitment, selfless service and sacrifice. - [Woman] - My favorite thing is being a leader and being a mentor. - [Man 3] They're - the best people I've ever met, - and it's been - an absolute honor - to be able to serve with them, - and it's something I'll cherish for the rest of my life. [Man 4] And when we've done our job... we go home. That's when we realize who we do it all for.
