So you are not off. - I think your watch's slowing down, because Žaneta's already here. -What does Žaneta has to do with? -Gipsies never come to work earlier. Back in the day when nobody had watches, one could estimate time like that. -Could you please avoid your rasist talk? -He is not a rasist, just a jerk. -Apologize to her immediately. -I think that on workplace there should exist a free opinion exchange, shouldn't it? -On workplace you should be working in the first place. -I stand for what I said. I am off, it is past four now, I am closing and bye. -Apologize. -Come on, you can not just change me... enforce opinion. Just because you..., are my boss. -I don't care about your opinion, what I care about is whether the bellows are in Boleslav. - Bellows tommorrow, I go home. -If you leave now, you got a big problem. -Is that so? -Oh yes. -Oh man. -Apologize! -Žaneta, I... Why are you smiling? She is laughing at me! You know it's past four! She knows it well, that it is past four. -That's alright. You are fired. -Is that real?! -Yes, real.

See - unlocked. Hey, Luďek. -Hi Tonda. -Hello. -Luďek, give me the three thousands! -Shsh! Sure, sure. Roman, today I was fired. -Am I charity? Look at me!

You'll stare. Lamino, man! First quality, watch. -Luděk, you know that if you put it on this moldy floor, it will swell up. -What? -May I ask, where is the toilet? -Where is toilet? 5 stairs down, second door left. Sorry, dear, don't be mad, but your groove comes out. -Thanks. -What is that?! -Luděk, you should not say such things to her. -Wait, dude, are you dating her? Are you dating her, such a whale?! -Of course not, she is just a co-driver. -Co- what? -I want to join the night car race. The crew must be mixed. -Moment, they said that? -Yop. -How mixed? -Like man and woman. -Aha. It is true, that with such a weight of co-driver you are pretty safe in right-wing curves. -Leave her alone, Luděk. -Sure. -I need a car. -Forget it. Look - you are 16, I can not let you drive in a car race, anyway old Juliš always wants to see driving licenses. -One woman from Litvínov makes them. -Wow, that's good. Does mum know about it? -Luděk! -I can not let you drive in an illegal car race. Bullshit! I am your father. That would not be ... responsible. -Responsible.

If you want to succeed in a business, you need to come up with something demanded in the locality. People can't efford taxi here. So this... Look, the target audience. -Don't point at me. Last time I went scrapping was during high school. -Don't say you have a high school diploma. -Joke. -Calm down, comedian, you are here as a vaccine. -I can come, 'cause I am the only one not drinking on credit -Sit on the corner, so people can't see you from outside! -White idiot. -Keep the angle, Franta, or you go! -František did not acquire education because our system discriminates Romas. He was not allowed to acquire appropriate education. -Father, I was playing hookey and stealing car radios. -Because of the system, František. -System. I was dumb! Now I am smart. -Fuck smart! It is the system, but it actually gives you advantage They take you everywhere so they are not viewed as racists, And me? I studied electrician high school, pumped-up CV because I worked in Prague, and what - unemployed. -You were doorkeeper, Čočkin. -I believe in Čočkin business talent. Once he will make a lot of money, become mayor of Most and perhaps finally allows, that our church of Assumption of Mary will be again turned from the south to the east. -Sure! -Luděk! -Oh god, not this. -It is thursday, right? -It is. -You have Tonda, right? -Sure. -And where is he? You are going to drink to Severka, don't you? -Not at all, I carry pizza to him. Tonda is at home, waiting for me. And I, if you allow, shall go home now. -Okay, Luděk. Send the maintance, Luděk. -You're messing with me. -Messing with her -Nobody will approve it, father. And even if - they will not take you back, you were excommunicated. They will take another priest, some Polish, completely different level. -Why? -They actually believe in God. -Hey, Luděk. -Hi. -Come on. What are you doing here? It is thursday, you have a boy. -He's got a date. Romana, could you heat it in microwave? I got cut off from electricity again. -No, no, no, Romana, no. Luděk, I have meatballs, you can't eat here food from outside. Not even you. -I broke out in rash from them last time. -Me too. -But it is not visible on you. -It is. But I can have one. -Now? -No, on monday. -Today I was fired. I said that gypsy never comes early to work. -True. -Yes. -Screw that. You are the man, Luděk. See, you just sit here and drink, but Luděk actually does something. -True. -Like what? -He got fired because of his political opinion, you scum. -Eda! Did you record it? -What? -Damn, you have to record such stuff and upload to YouTube. We live in a media world. -Čočkin is right. You are dumb, Such things need to get out. -Shit. -Otherwise it will not get better. You suck. -As somebody from the showbusiness I must say boys, that Most is not very attractive for media. -You were doorkeeper, wake up! -But in public Czech TV! A truly prestige position. You know who all I met? -Sure, he befriended Rákosníček. (cartoon character) -Yes, her too! -What about Lábus? -Both Jů and Hele. (puppet characters) -Boys, he should be here, let's do this. Peek inside, maybe he is not there at all. -Fine. So in the meantime set up the camera. -Right. -Gosh, look. He actually likes it. The rash is not visible on him. The only person able to prosper in the shits here. -Fuck, look. -Hello. -It's the guy from the TV competition, where they ask simple questions and making people look stupid. -Fine. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. -Man, he is coming here. Franta, you should answer, you are expected to be retarded, nation will be satisfied. -Fuck off! -Here. -Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen, I apologize to interrupt you while dining. Is any of you Luděk Říha? -Him. -So, Mr. Luděk, I greet you. I am Ondra the postman from the Czech TV show Mail for you. -Is that the one, where people meet again after long years? -Yes, precisely. Somebody requested meeting you and that is why he invited you to our show. Would you be interested? -Do not go, it will be some extramarital bastard of yours. -Who is inviting me? -I can not tell you. It would spoil the surprise. -In that case I am not interested. -We should not be afraid of our past, Luděk. -I am afraid of mine. My business, father. -Look, postman, wait outside, please nicely, we will quickly discuss it. -Is he there? -He is, but he is a bit wierd and thinks whether he will come. We will see. -Hello. Threesome? -Blowjob? -What threesome? We are six. -You have to go there. -Haven't you heard Franta? It will be some extramarital child or something. -Or your gay brother wants to come back. -Queers are cowards, it's probably not him. -I saw Pavel a few years ago on dad's funeral. and I think I explained the dicksucker resolutely that I don't ever want to see him. -Luděk, it doesn't matter who is it at the end. It is our chance to speak about the problems of Most. -Right. -In media. -Yes, you should say to the whole nation, how communists moved the church because of coal mining and how they turned him to different direction. -Sure, father, true. But mainly you can speak about the problems we have with the gypsy minority. You have to go, Luděk. And seriosly speak about what gypsies do here. -Go, chup chup. It will be fun. -Have you decided? -Is it paid? -Unfortunately no. Ester always say that the biggest reward is the happy reunion. -Can I claim the train ticket? -Sure, that is not a problem. -Okay. -Perfect, thank you. Could you go in and we will record how we search for you. -BBC mode? -So you can go back to your friends, sit normally, chill out, and we will come with the camera and the envelope. -Sure. -Super, thank you. So you can go. -Yes, yes. -I am there in a second. Good? Micro? OK. Let's go. We did not find Luděk at home. but his friends said that he could be in this nice little restaurant Severka, so we will see, if we get lucky. -Watch out... -Yes, yes. -I need to race too. -You do not have woman. -The least problem. -But I need money! -I need money. -Luděk, you never gave me a single penny. Never! -Don't say it, Tonda, just like your mom. Stop this crap. Reward is 5 thousand, 3 goes to Roman, and the rest in half. Good? -How do you know you will win? -No doubt about that, boy. You think you will win? -How am I supposed to get another car in two days? -Two days? Forget it, you are not gonna race! Done. Two days. What two days? -It is the day after tomorrow. -Is it? -Hmm. -Fuck, I go to the TV. -Wait, what TV? -Oh crap. -You will be in TV? I wonder who would want you in TV. -Forget it. -And what about the TV? -I will be in Mail for you. -What is Mail for you? -No jo! -Hey. -Hi, what are you doing here? You could go to the funeral of the gypsy king in this. -Franta, do not provoke me. Could you borrow me some money? Roman is still behind me. -You have to resist the people you owe to. You know what my grandpa always said? Debtor is a client, who also has rights. -Perfect. -Yeah, belt will help. -And could you? -I have only hundred. -Hello. -Hello. -I am Říha and I go to Mail for you. -Romana! -What's up? -You got it? -I am searching. -Hurry up, it is about to start. -I don't know where you put it. -I didn't put it anywhere. Look in the back. -Back? -Chup! -Not here. Got it! -Finally. -Here. -Good girl. -If it turns out Luděk has a bastard with some bitch I will cancel the thursdays. -Mum? Tonight I sleep at Dušan's. -Oh hell you don't. -Gert allowed me. You did, right? -Ja ja. -Here, Saša will put the make up. Enter, Saša will do it. -Hello Sit down so I can look at you. I can see you are a wee bit shiny up here... Hey, where are you going? -Super, cameras are on! -Have a nice evening, dear audience. I am glad you are back here. And welcome at the new series of Mail for you. which from now on is recorded and broadcasted live. Yes, from today you shall be witnesses... -Jesus, why do they give her such dress? She looks fat! Such a nice piece of woman... -...I believe that you will be pleased and that you will stay with us. The next Mail for you is on! In the first story we meet a beatiful lady, who came from Prague. Dáša! Good evening, Dáša! -Good evening. -Welcome. Please sit down. In the beginning I would like to ask you who you requested to have here in Mail for you? -Well, I asked for... eh... ...a close person from my life. -She is heavily maked-up, isn't she? -Eeh..., childhood to be precise. -Bitch. -Aha, somebody you were in contact, when you were young. -Yes, exactly. -Some close friend? -You could call it like that. We actually grew up together. -You don't want to say more. -No. I would like to explain, when Luděk will come. -My god, ladies man that Luděk! -Who is it? -Beauty. -You are keeping us tense, curious, how it will end up. -Yes. -Could you tell us something about you? What do you do? -Right now I am, let's say on a vacation or I quited a long-term job. There I was... -Where do I know her from? -Something like bartender. -Sort of waitress? -The other side of the bar. -How you can work on the other side of bar? -I was entertaining people bringing them entertainment. -Like a singer or dancer? -That too, yes, yes. -Aha! -Headphones, thank you. You get a headphones, so you can't hear anything. And we will move to the studio. Follow me. Watch out, the wires... Come on. Stay here, please. Wait and I will send you. -Luděk! Stay strong, Luděk! -...his friends said that he could be in this nice little restaurant Severka, so we will see, if we get lucky. Luděk, a control question. Were you student of the 14th elementary school here in Most? -Yes. -Look, he is really there! That is Severka! -Have you ever seen the show? -Yeah, I did. It is sometimes on here, muted. -So you know, that it is sort of a runion... -Right. -...with a person looking for you. Who could it be? -No idea. -Try to guess. -I don't know. -Okay, I will not poke it here, leave something for Ester. One last question: Are you going to come? -I will surely come and thank you for the invitation. -Hello, Ondra. -Hello, Ester. -Luděk looked quite shocked, so I hope we will uncover the relationship. I hope Luděk is here. -Luděk is here. -Now you can. -I am really glad, thank you. -Be careful. Good evening, Luděk, please. -Good evening, Luděk. -Good evening. -Good evening, welcome. Please sit. -Well, I am curious. -Watch out the step. Here please, this is your place. I am so glad you are here. I bet you were thinking the whole week since Ondra the postman visited you who could have invited you to the Mail for you. Who do you think is behind the wall here? -To be honest, I haven't thought much about it. -Really? -Hmm. But I though what I will say here. Because... -Gentlemen, we are making the history here! -Yes! -So you undrestand - I live in Most, we have there the social problems. It is not only there, but I think that in the Most it is the most. Me and my frinds we made a list of several points, concrete solutions for Most. - Aha. Don't you want to speak first about who invited you? -Please, I need to say this. So first - we want to reduce the price of iron scrapping for gypsies. So they rather go work and don't disassemble panel houses. which we pay. In the practice gypsy would come with cart of scrap to junkyard and gets half of what white gets. Discrimination? Yes, but it would help. -I can not go back to school anymore. -Sorry, he is right! Finally! Good. -I do not want to be rude, but these are important things for our region. I think you don't know that communists moved church of Assumption from the old Most and it is oriented to the south. -Aha. -Well the church has to be turned to the east and consacrated again. -God will reward you, Luděk. -And last but not least we want stricter control of meatballs from North-Czechia meatplants, because ... ... after meatball Coalman's snack, that's the name, all guys from the pub got rash. Only Franta not. It was not visible, but just because he is a gypsy. -It was, wasn't it? I got rash. -Sure, you did. -That's it, thank you. I had to say this. Hey, Most f'ever! -Yeah, right! Yes! -Luděk, you had the control question from the childhood, about your elementary school, don't you think it could be kind of a hint? Or are you... -To be honest, I don't know... -I am curious. -You are here, so we will see. -I hope you will be pleased by the reunion. -I hope I will. -You know a bit how it works here in Mail for you. On the screen you will see the person who invited you, then you can decide if you want to meet in person. Please. -Thank you. -Hello, Luděk. -Hello. -Hi. -It is me, brother Pavel. -Sorry? -I was operated. Now I am your sister, Dáša. -Are you kidding me? -Hey, Luděk. -Was ist los? -That is played, not possible! -Pavel, I... -Bruder. -I recognize you by ... -Ach so. -What have you done with you? On dad's funeral you were kind of normal. -I know, I understand I did not have everything done and didn't want to wear makeup on the funeral. I did not plan to tell you... -What's with your voice? -I was not prepared to tell you, I also thought it might be the last time we see each other, I was scared. Luděk, I know it is hard to understand, but it is the truth. I am Dáša, your sister. -This is all wrong. -I am coming back to Most. -Oh hell you are not. Don't dare to show up there, Pavel. -I want to start over. -Different time, look. -Why do you go to TV, you moron?! -I have the right. -Wake up! If you are diviated, go hide in a pit, and do not go to TV! Why do you bother me about it now?! -Luděk, stop! -Luděk, I have the final question, can I remove the wall between you and Dáša, so you can meet... -Pavel, our father in grave cries. Our father cries. -Luděk, can I remove the wall? -Luděk, chill. -You freak! -Luděk, can I remove the wall between you two? That is my last question. -Pardon, wall? -Bro! -If I may remove it... -You know what? Be kind and remove it. -Terrific, I am glad. Please, remove the wall. -Don't do it. Don't do it. -Hey, brother. -I will kill you, Pavel! I will bone you, you dick! -Luděk, please, do not beat her. She is a woman, Luděk! -Oh, please! -Even this is how our stories can end in Mail for you if we broadcast live. I certainly hope, that Luděk gets used to his sister Dáša... -I go to Dušan's. -You want a ride? -You want more? -I thought you do not beat women. -Pavle, go away. Go away from my life, I don't want to see you ever again! -I am going to Most, sit down. -Fuck off! -I can give you a ride. Get in, brother. -Roman? -Oh hello, Luděk! I saw you in TV. So I want the money back, waiting till midnight in bar Citore in Litvinov. -You said I have time till the end of the week. -You think I am stupid?! You think I don't know what is paid for acting in TV in these comedies? -There was no reward for it! -If you do not bring me the money, I will come to your place with Zoran. -So what? -Goddamn it. Hey, is this car still fast? -Are you kidding me? Sure. -Tonight there is a car race, crew must be mixed. -Still racing? Does Juliš organize it? -We will win the race, take the money and then each our own way. -Bald tyres, Kamil. -But Michelin's. -What about the bump here? -Kerb. -Can't park and want to race? -I do. -As you want, Kamil. -Old harridan. -Young, ain't we? Driving license. Yes, fine. -Hey, hi. -Good evening, Mr. Juliš. Hello, Tonda. -Hello, uncle. -Aunt. I haven't seen you in a while. -Nice to see you, Pavel. -Are you competing? -Bets are out? -Bets are out, but nobody bet. Wait, wait. Crews must be mixed. You know, I care about the rules. -That is true, you can't race. -Mr. Juliš, come with me. -Good evening, Mrs. Juliš. -Crew is allowed to start. -I am driving. -My car, so I drive. -Kamil gets blown his rear left tyre in the first bend. -Wow, look! -Minus one. -Cut the curves, the car can make it. -They zigzag so much. Just a bit... -We got another one! -Yes, you have him! -Tonda is in the lead. That's my boy! He is the first! But we do not want it! Go, go, go! Inner, inner! We go! Bye! And go, Tonda, Tonda, Tonda! Take him. He is blocking us. We are almost at the end, you have to overtake him, Pavel. -He is sticked to us! -I can see. -Go inner! Do not hit him! Good, good! -Are you kidding me?! -Motherfucker! -That di... -Good, good! Tonda, don't be mad! Don't be mad! -Okay, here you go. -Thank you, Mr. Juliš. -Thank you. See you. -Bye. -Tonda, don't be angry, I need the money. -I need the money too. -Tonda, here. -Hey, moment! -What? I was driving, we went with my car, I have at least a half and I give it to Tonda. -Thank you. -I am happy that you are happy, because this is not enough, and now Zoran will kick my ass. Can I take you home, youngsters? -Why not? -Why not, great. -Will you give me half? -I will give you a hundred. For the rest I need to buy a present. -For me? -No, definitely not for you. -I went the stupid race with you, so you would buy a present for some bitch? -Please, shut up. -Even bigger douche than your father. -Great, sit down. -See you home. -Forget it! Get a hostel. Is Roman here? -No. -No? -Don't worry, he will find you. -A shot, something light. Fuck. -Do you have the money for me? -Roman, good, I do, I do. I was waiting for you the whole night. -Give it to me. -I was looking for you in the bar. -Calm down your monkey. -Not enough, TV star. -Not enough? How much is it? -You owe 3 thousand. -Well so? -2 thousand. -Moment. Hey, Pavel, what are you doing here?! I told you to go to hostel, fuck off! -How much does he owe you? -Thousand more. -Leave me alone. -Leave him. -Leave him. This looks even better than in TV. Show me, how they do the chassis. Off we go. -Amazing, mister comes and throws thousands in people? You think I will shit myself for it? Turn around and go to Minjapuru, go away! Bye! What's up, why are you unpacking? You think that I... Moment, you are not in rent here. Where are you going? -I went to take my stuff at the railway station, I will live here. -Live here? Moment! -You thought, that I will be paying a rent when half of the house is mine? This is my home too. -No, forget it! Upstairs is my kingdom. Here, you can get the floor after father.
