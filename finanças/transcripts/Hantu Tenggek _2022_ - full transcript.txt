"A film by" Share with us some tips on reciting the Quran. I'll conduct tuition classes for you. Okay. Okay, I'm heading home. Bye, take care! Bye. -Bye. Be careful. It's dark. Bye. -It's so dark. What was that? Ain! "Don't blame me for not knowing. "He came my way. "Don't be jealous" "You won't admit it" "Oh baby, forgive me!" Hey! Why does my car smell like roadkill? Didn't you shower? It's really smelly. Thank you. Just a moment. Welcome! Please. This way. This way. Isn't this lovely. Like always. Raise your hand. Like always. One, two, three. Next time, when I get out of the car,... ...you open the door. Not me. Understood? Since when is there a day club in our village? Go check, please. What is happening? -"Oh baby, forgive me!" Forgive us God! What is going on? No! Sit down! Are you humans or monkeys? Ain! I asked you to look after her! What have you done? What is going on? I'm sorry, Tok. -There! Bring her there! Yes, Tok. -Who's child is this? Oh, mine. All of you. What is happening to you? We are going through difficulties as is. Even if our village is named "The Tight Spot Village",... ...please don't put me in a tight spot! Do you remember who I am? Yes, we do! -Who am I? The chief! So, you do know. For your information,... ...not only do I have a big car,... ...I also have a big private jet. Even if it doesn't fly, I turned it into a cafe. Please come by. Free meals. -Will do. You can pay if you insist. Have a seat. Sit. Tok, I have something to tell you. Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Go ahead. -Okay. We can't stay silent. That's why I'm asking you to speak. Don't be silent. I will! If you'd let me. -Okay. If we stay silent, they'll keep bothering us. We need to solve this problem. -"Oh, you won't admit it!" This is for our village. -"Oh, baby forgive me!" I agree. -The problem is, Tok,... ...we are talking about spirits that we can't see. They can see us and watch our every moves. Don't you agree? -Unlike you, hard to miss. Which is why, I have a suggestion. Why don't we be on the lookout tonight? Lookout? -We find out... ...whether the ghost comes out or not. If it doesn't, it means someone in this village is messing with us. Parbu, what are you rambling about? Look at Siti. She looks so pretty. She is pretty. The one you're talking about is my daughter. Watch your mouth. Help! Help! Tok! -Yes. What is it, Ana? I..... -What is it? I saw a ghost. At the cabin. The ghost is a lady. What a coincidence. I see a lady too. Ana. Don't worry, Ana. Don't panic. I'm here. Come sit down. You're like my own daughter. Tell me what happened. It's like this, Tok. I saw a lady. It wasn't me. I saw her at the cabin. By God, Tok. I'm not lying. This is not a drill! Not a drill? Calm down everyone. It's okay. You too, Ana. Calm down. Come, have a seat. Come. You're like my own daughter. And you smell good too. It's okay. -Poor thing. Get up. You don't even fit in the chair. Come, watch your step. You poor thing, Ana. Ana is like my own daughter. Now what are we going to do about this? I have a suggestion. What's your suggestion? Let's hear it. We're here. There! There. There. And there. That's enough. We got this. "The witch-doctor is chanting mantra." "With a glass of water." "And spatters of sand!" Wak, what was that? Will this building bring me good fortune? Should I acquire the building? What do you see? -That's true. This building will bring you good fortune. You should acquire this building. But..... Hire your people to excavate the land. Seven feet under! And three feet wide. And don't forget! That shield! Red and blue. -Yes, that. Needs to be buried by the time we leave. Isn't that a grave? No objections! Just abide by Wak's instructions. Wak, what's next? Next..... You come back to this place. During the full moon,... ...and nothing happens,... ...then you just return home. -Are you kidding? What are you saying? You said this building will bring me good fortune. I'm trying to acquire this building. Don't play around. What he's trying to say is,... ...this place and it's location is suitable. Just, should anything happen after midnight,... ...then leave, don't acquire it. If anything, contact us. That's a different charge. Understood. Now I understand. I didn't get it when he spoke in bahasa Malaysia. Now that it's in bahasa Indonesia, I understand. Wak, do I have to come back alone? I need to know. So many replies! It said, you can come back alone. Or you can come back with a whole village. It doesn't matter. Okay, then what? Really? It said, we can now leave, by backing away. Back away. -Follow us. Leave! -Just follow. Yes, we're leaving! Get in the car! "Don't be mad at me!" "It's not my fault!" -Be quiet. Get a drink. Keep her quiet. How long have we been waiting? Half an hour? Where are they? They should be on their way. Anytime now. Please be patient. I'm in doubt. Can they really help us? Don't you worry. I was told, they are the very best. They can handle all mystical matters. Mystic or mistake? She's right. I've seen them capturing ghosts. Their service is really good. Nowadays, there's all kinds of services. But of course, the service comes with charges. Charges? For my daughter, I'll do anything. "My love, oh my love." They're here! "Don't be mad at me!" -Bring her inside. "No, don't be mad at me!" "I did not know." "He came my way." "Don't be jealous." "Oh, you won't admit it." -Let's welcome them. Peace be upon you. Welco..... You..... Come sit. Ana, sit here with me. -Okay. Like my own. You finally arrived. Welcome to our village. So, its like this..... -I know! This is about the ghost that has been bothering the village. The one that has been singing..... "Don't be mad at me!" "Pretending to not know." "Going everywhere but ending up nowhere." "Scenario!" For as long as the ghost is here,... ...it will keep making a "joke" of you. Tyrant. We are the jokers. How do they know all this? Ana, what did you tell them? I swear it wasn't me. Are you sure? -Yes. Something's off. Don't sulk. I was just joking. What is his problem? We don't like people who doubt what we do. Goodbye. Wait, just a moment. Do you trust us? -Yes. We can help but we need to know what's the village population? 188 people minus my late wife. It was 189. -188? If a person pays RM88, then... ...88 minus SST, plus 6 percent GST. The total is RM16,888. -Is there a discount? A discount? We're leaving. No, wait. -Ana, stop messing around. A discount? -No. We're not the supermarket. -No. Please. -How many people? 188 people. -Okay. Why don't I pay? Great, even the ghost doesn't like a discount. We don't do QR code methods. Cash only. Okay? We'll see you at midnight. Don't forget the money. I'm leaving now. Don't look at me. Look up. For eight minutes. One, two, three, four,... ...five, six, seven, eight. Tok, they're here! They're here. "He came my way." You! You haven't performed your obligatory bath. I didn't have enough time. Silence! Go home! With that beehive hair. I need a few young men. Virgins. You! Follow me. -No. I'm young but I'm not a virgin. Can't you go by yourself? I thought you were the expert. -Be quiet. With your eyes widened. Gout face. You, follow me! Do you want to hear me sing? "Don't be mad at me....." Sorry, she's possessed. Possessed? But she looks crazy. Watch your mouth. That's my daughter, Siti. Bring her along! When are we setting off? The cabin..... Tok, I know. Let's go. Wait a minute! Sorry everyone. They only need 10 people. -Yes. Others please go home. -Yes, head home. Go home. -Let's go. Go home. This is the cabin. -I know! Be careful. Watch out for the rock. You wait here while we go up. But we'll just stay out. You, follow me. Here. It's okay. Come in. Don't be afraid. Look. Ghost! Ghost! -Don't run. Big guy but small brain. You! Follow me. Quickly! -It's okay. We'll wait here. Look. Don't run! -Hey! Definitely not a virgin. Recite this! -What is this? Recite! -It's in Jawi, I can't. You recite it! I didn't go to school! Recite it quick! -We can't! Follow me. Nang! -Nang! Nang nang! -Nang nang! Ning! -Ning! Ning nang ning! -Ning nang ning! Nang nang ning! -Nang nang ning! Louder! -Louder. Get down! -Get down. Okay, Tok. We got it. What is that? -A funfair bottle. The ghost, of course! Now, do you want to bring it home? -No, you keep it. Okay, I'll take care of it. We're safe now. You, you haven't prayed Isyak. Go home! Me? -Go home! Tok, I'm heading home. -It's okay, go. Dad! What are we doing here? Praise be to God! Siti, you're okay! They really are good at their job! Thank you! It's okay, it's a long story. I'll tell you everything later. So, it's settled. Now..... What? Sorry, I'm using my left hand. All right. So, nobody can leave this place... ...for eight minutes. Because I need to bless this area. When? -Starting now. But before that, recite this mantra. Let's read. Hey! You! You haven't performed your obligatory bath. Go home! -Wait just a moment. They're reciting the mantra. How can you dance at a time like this? Help me! Just a second. Louder! -Louder. Quick! I've been here for ages! Quick! Now, go out! You! You haven't prayed Isyak. Go home! Oh gosh! Where have you been? Calm down. Don't make a noise. They could hear us. Let's go. Turn off the torchlight. They'll see it. Hurry up. -Okay, let's go. Wait for me. -Let's go, quick. Wait for me. Let's go. Let's go. Tariq and Yusof are waiting for us. Wear this. The villagers can't see you looking like this. Hurry up, my backside is hurting. I squatted too long under the house. Ali, this is such a hassle. Why can't they pick us up? Tariq has mentioned this. If anyone sees us, there goes our plan. Excuses, excuses. Why are you so heavy? -Watch your mouth. Just cycle. Fine. You're cycling too slow. Pick up the pace. Stop. -What is it? There's a motorcycle. Oh yeah. -See if it'll work. Let's go. It'll be faster. -Let's go. Let's go. Will it work? Oh no! Who are you? Are you stealing the motorcycle? Get down! What he means is, are you stealing this motorcycle? No, I'm just making sure it works. Shush. Now it's not about you making it work,... ...but it's about what's ours. Did you get that? I don't understand. -He said,... ...you are thieves but we are robbers! So, you can speak bahasa Malaysia. We're a Malaysian family so you need to understand. Get down! Feet, on the ground. Empty your pockets. I don't have anything. Not even money. What is this? Please, don't. -Now! Take out your phones. Chains, everything. Now! Chains? It's right there. Take it. The bicycle chain. Brother, you're being rude. Give us everything you have. -I don't have anything. Please, don't. -Who's this hiding behind... ...your back? Come up front. Who is this? Come here. Ali. -Don't touch her. She has Covid. Ali, no. -Take it off. Ali, tell them no. Come on, let's go. Serves them right. Quick! Darn it! -Darn. Hurry up. Bye. A! Ana. U! Usop. -T! Tariq. A! Ali. -A! Aishah. And we are the Deception Gang! No entity can escape. -We'll get them all. "The Perched Ghost" RM16,500. Between us 5, each gets 1.1 million. I can make a film. You fool! Each gets RM3,300! Tariq, get out here! Be patient. Can't I set my hair in peace? We waited so long, your hair grew long. Where were you? It wasn't easy for me to perch under that cabin. I was there for so long, my backside started hurting. Okay, let's divide the money. Your part. Your part. Your part. -Your part. Hey, this is not UNO. Why is your stack thicker than ours? Come on, Tariq. Why is our part lesser than yours? You throwing a party? Your plan will not have worked if it wasn't for me playing the ghost. I don't care, pay me more now. For you Aishah, here's a little more. Wow. You're so understanding with her. I'm taking more for me. Aishah, this is for our wedding. -You wish. Think, at our headquarters... ...I take care of everything! Electric bills, Water bills. Food, sweetheart. Everything costs money. Have you ever even cared? You could've told us. Okay, that's enough. Just tell us, we understand. Please don't quarrel. Don't you trust me? We're childhood friends. Don't worry. Next,... ...there's a bigger plan. More money. So, now that we have the money, tomorrow we go..... Party! Eat! Eat! This is what we call "Mr Sidek's sustenance". Help yourself. Stealing from people tastes so delicious! Praise be to God. Now that we're happy filling ourselves up, what's our next plan? There has to be more. He's right. We can't wait until our money runs out... ...before we plan for another. I think we can still fool Mr Sidek a little more. The money he gave us didn't even put a dent in his pocket. I have a plan. Why don't we kidnap his daughter? The daughter must be as foolish as the father. I agree. I don't want to be involved in that crazy plan. We are not kidnappers. And Mr Sidek knows a lot of powerful people. Ana is right. I don't want to be a kidnapper. I want to be a scammer, a professional. Don't be fools like Mr Sidek. We won't kidnap her for real. We'll say his daughter was taken by Forest Elves. Then we'll "save" her, and charge him money. The plan sounds good but Mr Sidek's house is guarded. Guarded? Guarded. Ana, what if... ...you use your beauty..... -Am I not beautiful? Of course you are! You are, but you are the ghost. The beautiful ghost. Use your beauty to seduce the guards. Imagine... ...Ana dressed like a proper lady. -Me? A proper lady? You've got to be kidding. -Yes, then you seduce the guard... ...until he melts in your arms. -Gross. But don't fall in love with him. -Keep your mouth shut. Then, Usop, Aishah and I will sneak into the house. What do we do once we're inside? Usop and I will go to his daughter's room. Don't forget the chloroform. Make sure she's knocked out then we bring her with us "to-go". She's not a drink for take-away. This is my plan. Aishah, you head to Mr Sidek's room... ...and scare him. If he wakes up, you scream. He'll be scared straight. What if he's not scared? -Then knock him out. If we're doing all the work, what's Ali doing? Ali will wait by the car. Once everything is done, he'll drive us away. What do you think? Okay? -Okay. I'm in. Because it sounds like easy money. Let's go. Boss. I have some bad news. One after another. What is it this time? Rumour is, Rahim is planning to acquire the abandoned building. The dance academy? -Yes. But don't worry. I was informed that he won't acquire the building if... ...it's haunted. I think I know what to do. Not you! "Mystic Hunters." Okay, do we have everything? -Yes. Ali, you stay here until we come back. Okay, let's go. Hey guys, be quick. I'm scared. Where are the guards? Who's guarding the house then? There's no one. Here. What's wrong with you? Where are the others? Hey, I told you to come from there. But that was yesterday's plan -Oh yesterday's plan? The guards are not here. Who am I suppose to seduce? Seduce me. -You? Maybe it's a good thing the guards aren't here. Easy come, easy go. Okay, if I follow you inside, what am I suppose to do? That's enough. Follow us in. If Mr Sidek is awaken, you seduce him. Make sure it's clear there. Me? Alone? -Yes. Let's go. What? -She's with me. We're going there. You check that side. Go! Help! Let us go! So this is what you've been up to. Want to fool me. You think it's like taking candy from a baby? Do you know who I am? That voice sounds familiar. Look at the picture. Remember me? Happy Party Sidek? You must be wondering how I figured it out. I agree. I don't want to be involved in that crazy plan. We are not kidnappers. And Mr Sidek knows a lot of powerful people. Don't be fools like Mr Sidek. We won't kidnap her for real. We'll say his daughter was taken by Forest Elves. Then we'll "save" her, and charge him money. Okay, let's go. -Let's go. I'm full from eating other people's money. Let's party! -Let's party Sidek! Now you know. Let's party Sidek? Tok Sidek, we were only joking. Well I'm not laughing. Have you slept on a mattress? No, only on comforters. Pity, but that's okay. Today I have the most expensive mattress for you. You want to try it out? -Yes. Yes. -The most expensive mattress... ...is made of cement at the Sungai Buloh Prison! No, please no. -No! We're sorry. Wow, a ghost that knows how to apologize. No! Cicakman! Untie us. You. You are the worst of the lot. What did you do the other day? Utterly rude. Get down. Look up! Now count to 15. -One..... Quietly! Now listen closely,... ...all of you have to be... ..at the abandoned dance and vocal academy. If you fail to show up,... ...the Sungai Buloh Prison! -No, please no. Don't touch me! Where's our other friend? The woman? -No, the man. Are you a man or a woman? Ana, how could you? I have taken you as one of my own. How could you make a fool of me? And the others,... ...how could you? Attempting to kidnap my daughter, Siti. Remember this. If you don't show up tomorrow,... ...then it's the Sungai Buloh Prison for you! No, please no. -Be quiet! The same goes for your unmanly friend. You, don't worry about him. Now. Sit and be quiet! No! -Be quiet! Before I change my mind,... ...get out now! One, two, three, get out! An evil Cicakman. Ouch! The nerve! I'm sleepy. -You are crazy. Let me sleep. -Come! Go! I'm scared. -Wow. I really like this place. If I was a film director, I'd film a horror movie here. Imagine, having really good actors. Chef Wan as a lead. He walks then he stops and says,... ..."No ghosts but there are onions." Then we keep rolling..... Slenderman! Don't call me that. I'll whack you with a broom. Good thing you showed up. I would've called the police. Listen up. I want to acquire this building. The problem is, another person wants this building too. I hate competition. I don't care. What I want, I will get. I will get, what I want. Now, you... ...will use the same plan you used on me... ..on him. So he won't acquire this building. Get it? But Mr Sidek..... -No buts! Remember. I didn't throw you in jail nor did I report you to the police. But I will also award you with this. Do you want to make some money? Take the money. It's a deal. It's a deal? No, we can't. Mr Sidek, our group won't work without Ali. We need Ali, please. Also, who's going to do Aishah's makeup? Don't worry about him. Is he really necessary? I don't think we need him but okay. I'll get him back. Help! Let me go! -Ali! Help me! -Ali! Please let me go! -Ali! Here he is, boss. Ali! -Help me. Your hair smells bad. Usop, untie him. -That's enough. I'm not interested in your drama. I don't care. I want you to fix my problem. I don't really need this building. I need this land. Then I will fulfill my dreams. Give them the torchlights. The torchlight is not heavy, your head is! Pass it around. We're leaving. Don't forget. Don't be foolish. No need to hit them. To the car. You're driving me crazy. How many times... ...do I have to remind you? Keep that foolishness away. Let's go? Serves you right for keeping that hair. It's too big. What is this place? I heard this place has been abandoned for a decade. That's a long time. Okay, now let's split up. Find things we can use to scare them. Aishah and I will go that way. What? You're always with Aishah. It's my turn. Don't fight. Okay, you and Aishah head that way. You head to the back. What? Seriously? Do you prefer the back door or the prison door? Fine. Ana and I will go upstairs. Come on. Let's go. It's hot in here. What is that? What happened? Where's Aishah? -Shush. Aishah! Aishah! Aishah! Aishah! -Aishah! Aishah. -Aishah. Aishah. -Are you okay? Where were you? Aishah. You okay? Look at these musical notes. Weird, right? What's weird about it? This is a dance academy. By Ramli M.S.? But there's blood. That's not blood. It's bird droppings. Enough! Let's keep moving. Nonsense. -Aishah, let's go. Enough with that. It's getting late and I want to go home. I think we should use our usual plan. After what we saw with the building. Make sure Aishah plays her role well. Why don't we use the furniture in the building? We can move it around. Here and there to scare them. How are you going to move them around? Use your brain. We will use fishing lines. Listen to this. Imagine, an old abandoned building. We fog it up with a smoke machine. Fog in. Foggy. But the building has electricity. With a countdown of three, two, one. Blackout! Wow! What do you think? What do you think of my makeup skills? Wow! I have never been afraid of how Aishah looks. But not you. You look like a "Jenglot". Watch your hands. Why? -Don't touch her. How about this? No? -No! Okay. The makeup is right. The plan is right. Let's go. Let's pack up. We leave tomorrow. -Let's go. "Mystic Hunters" Okay. Let's go. Usop. -Yes. Get things set up in the control room. Ali. -Yes. Get things set up in the makeup room. Got it. -Ana, clear out this space. Aishah. -Yes. When they show up, you appear from there. To scare them. -Okay. Let me hear your ghost wail. You sound like a crazy person. Ali, show her how it's done. Okay, in that case, Aishah will do the visuals. Ali will do the sound effects. -Okay. Now, let's go. We don't have much time. Okay, is everything set? -Yes. Good. Put this there. How many CCTVs do we have? There's six but we have a few here. In that case,... ...let's set two downstairs so we can monitor who comes in and out. Another at the foyer. -At the front? Okay. Okay, sure. -And another at the back. At the back? I think we should put one out front to surveil their cars. Okay. -Okay. Ana, come with me. -Okay. If anything, contact us. -Okay, roger that. Let's be quick. Come on. Ali, Aishah. Stand by. It's still early. I'm bored. If only Aishah was here. I'd have someone to talk to. Tariq! Come in, Tariq. Tariq! They're here. In position. They're here. Are you sure this is the place? Boss, are you sure you want to get this place? Yes, this is the place. Be quiet. Of all the buildings you could've gotten,... ...why does it have to be this one? Wak said this place will bring me good fortune. Am I the boss or are you? You are. -Go in front! Are you sure there's a full moon tonight? Lan, it's tonight right? According to Google, yes. Google says so. Which means if nothing happens tonight, this place is mine! What are you waiting for? Go in! Quick! You first. -No, you first. Just go in. What are you afraid of? Go in. Nothing here. But step in with your right foot. Why the right foot? Because the left foot will bring bad luck. Boss! Useless! Don't be afraid. Calm down. Don't be afraid. It was the wind. Look at me. Take a deep breath. It was the wind. This is a test. It's the wind. Calm down. Let's head this way. Run! Let's go! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! You drive! Drive, quick! Great job! The trick with the TV was amazing! Aishah, you did amazing! Amazing actress. Oy! Why are you kissing her hand? Aishah, wash your hands with bleach when you get home. Don't quarrel. We'll get our reward soon. Now, inform Mr Sidek that the job is done. Ask him to pay us tonight! Hello. Mr Sidek. That's enough. A strong one. I have "protected" your house. Yes, it's shielded now. -Yes, shielded. My concern now is not you. But you! Your wife! She might have another man in the future. But don't worry. Everything is shielded. Okay? Thank you, Tok. -You're welcome. With conditions! -What is it? You can't look at each other for seven consecutive days. Can you do that? -Yes. Are you sure? -Yes. Yes? Okay, great. What do we owe you? -That. Yes. RM4,444.44. Tok, we don't have enough cash. We only have RM3,000. RM3,000? Don't worry. -You can pay via QR code. Please. Okay, it's done. -Okay. Paid. Good. Remember! Don't look at each other. Okay, Tok. -Seven days. But you can video call each other. -Video call is fine? Yes. Thank you, Tok. -You're welcome. Please. Hello. -This is Rahim. Just a moment. Wak! -Yes? There's a call for you. -Seven days and seven nights! It's Rahim. Rahim? Hello. Hello, Wak. There's something at the building I'm acquiring. I know. That place is haunted. I was there last night during the full moon. There's ghost! I have the deposit ready to acquire the building. Can you come by tomorrow during the day? No, I can't. Not during the day. I can come at night. During the full moon. It's peaceful at night. The more peaceful, the better. Are you sure? Tomorrow night then. Please get rid of the ghosts. Okay, I will. Bye. -Bye. You. Why? -Why? Don't call me Wak in front of guests. Then, what should I call you? What? I'm embarrassed. Why can't we just tell people that we..... We're together. You could call me "Honey". You could call me "Sweetheart". Sweetheart? Honey? -Yes. My love! -My love? Locked! Locked! My love! Yes, my love -Locked! "I want nobody, nobody but you!" "I want nobody, nobody but you!" "Nobody, nobody. Nobody, nobody." "I want nobody, nobo....." -Shush. Aishah is sleeping! What's wrong with her? -She has a fever. A fever? Where are you going? To check on Aishah. -No need! Your room's that way. I've already checked on her. I even gave her medicine. And a goodnight kiss. Go! What a bother to Aishah. It's Mr Sidek! "Get some money....." "Can we get some money." Hello, Mr Sidek. Hello. What about our payment? Don't you dare ask me for payment! I am at the building now. Why is it not settled? I heard that Rahim,... ...he's coming back tonight with a witch-doctor. Stupid? -Not stupid, stupid! A witch-doctor! But, Mr Sidek..... No buts! I don't care. Now, I need you to return here and get this done. Until they truly believe this place is haunted. And Rahim changes his mind to acquire this building! Or else, the Sungai Buloh Prison for all of you! No, Mr Sidek..... Mr Sidek? -He hung up. Useless. Having a good time? Yes. Comfortable? -Very. Come here. Yes, boss. I asked you to stand by inside the building. What are you doing out here? I'm tired from walking. When I get my hands on this place, you will be the guards. I haven't even bought this place and..... As usual. Face each other. One, two, three! Be better next time. Get the door. -Okay, boss. Let's go. Ouch. Why did I hire you? Do we have to go back? It was difficult the first time. We don't have any choice. You want to go to prison? We don't have much time to prepare. We only have a few hours. We have to move now. But who'll play the ghost? Usop, are the CCTVs in place? Yes, just one more to set downstairs. You have the usual shroud ghost, banshees but this one..... What is he? -A garbage ghost! I haven't laughed this hard in awhile. Aishah. Just rest, okay? If anything,... ...let me know. "Spirits up till the end." -That's enough! What "Tarik sis"? What "Semongko"? I'm here. Aishah. Camera 3. Don't make me bite you! Hey, keep it down. They could hear you. I could smack your silly face. Aishah, you okay? Just stay with me. I'll take care of you. Shush. Keep moving. There! Wak. Is it still here? Tariq and Ali. Stand by and wait for my cue. Did you get that? Aishah, you okay? I love you. Tariq, Ali, Ana. They're in. Ali stand by. Quick! In position. Wak! Is it here, Wak? Get them all, Wak. Wak. -Don't call me that. Baby, what do we do? I've got goosebumps and I'm scared. Recite the mantra. -The mantra? Okay, let's go. There! What was that, Wak? There. -Quick. Should we go here or there? Sorry Usop. I farted. Okay, Usop. Okay. We shot them all. Now, we take a deep breath. Wak. -It moved. Ghosts! Wak! Run! You fell for it, fools! Great job! Great job, Ali! Your make up is next level. Amazing! Okay, now..... Call Mr Sidek then we head down to Usop. Tariq! Ana! There's..... Tariq! Do you hear me? Ana! Tariq. They ran so fast! It's true! What's wrong? -Come here! What's with you? There's..... A ghost? Up top? Are you really Ali? -Yes. Okay, now... ...let's get to the car. -Wait. Aishah! Aishah has been possessed. I'm going home! -No, wait. We can't leave Aishah here. I can't talk to the ghost! Aishah is our friend. We have to go in and get her. Don't quarrel. You go get Aishah, I'll wait here. Okay. Good luck. Wait for me! Pick up the phone! Don't they want their payment? What's that sound? There's nothing here. What is that? Go away! You scared me. What is it? What is it? What's wrong with you? Look up? Why did you faint here? We are cowards. Go that way! I want to go home! Aishah! Aishah! Where'd she go? Aishah. She was here a minute ago. Usop. The control room. Let's go! Aishah! Aishah! Do you hear that? Let's move! Aishah. Aishah. Aishah. -Go away! Aishah. -Get out! You don't know what you're dealing with! Aishah is really possessed. Now, Usop,... ...you sneak up behind her. Then tackle her down. Where's that black pepper I gave you? It's here with me. Okay, I'll use it on her feet. Okay? Let's go. Aishah. -What are you doing here? Let's go home. Aishah. -Get out! I got her! Quick! -No! Let me go! Let me go! Quick! Aishah! Let me go! Aishah. Aishah. Aishah. Aishah, wake up! Aishah. Aishah, wake up! Wake up, Aishah! Bring her down. That was tiring. I'll get down on my own! -Then, quick! Go back inside! Go back inside! Who do you think you are? Taking over my land. Please let us go. We're not here to take over your land. We're here to scare the buyer. I know. Actually I helped you. Helped us? I was the one who sent everyone away. Because they tried to take over my land. You! Who are you? I am... ...Maria! This was my beginning. This is when I found love in leisure. I was a nobody. But... ...when I was offered to be a dance instructor,... ...my spirit breathed with life. Everything began here. My talents and spirit aligned. Then, everything was destroyed. Before I can even begin,... ...I was hit by tragedy. I still long for... ...a dream that was never fulfilled. My spirit is in torment. That's my tale. Sister. Is she your sister? Then, what do I call her? Maria! Maria. If you were to teach us to dance and sing,... ...you will let us go? Yes. Under one condition. You have to stay and learn to dance until dawn. Who amongst you knows how to dance? -Me. I'm a K-Pop fan. There! Now? -Now. Stop! You! I don't know how to dance. I'm sorry. -You! Dance! -Dance? As you wish. "As I swing my arms" "As I move my body." "And I do the Poco Poco." Stop! I want you to dance a traditional dance. Traditional? All of you, get over there! There..... Stand by me. Wake up! Let me sleep. -Wake up. She's gone. Aishah, wake up. Maria is gone. Hey! -Maria! Maria's gone! Quick! -Let's go! Before she comes back. Ana, how's Aishah? -Yes. She's okay. She's resting. I'm remorseful. I never want to do this again. Me too. Same here. I think this is karma. We have tricked so many people. All of you, I'm sorry. You got involved in this because of me. No need to apologize. We were in this together. Okay, moving forward... ...I'm going to meet with Prof. Razak Mohaideen... ...to direct a film. "The Perched Ghost." Great, don't forget to have me. I can do the makeup. You can't even do your own face. For me, I want to go into business. A halal business and make tons of money. When "The Perched Ghost" makes it as a blockbuster,... ...I'm going to use the money to get married. With who? Aishah! Aishah? Then what about me? You'll go into catering. You'll make "Ambuyat", noodle-filled curry puffs,... ...Sabahan delights. Great! I'll put poison in the noodles then you'll die. Don't quarrel. You think Aishah will marry you? In your dreams. Are you jealous? Nobody want you. -Oh please. Don't quarrel. Why don't the both of you ask Aishah what she wants? Okay, fine. Let's go ask her. Come with us as witnesses. Let's go. Look. "The End. Watch out for The Perched Ghost 2."
