No, sister Dan, the location of this house is really nice it's spacious enough, with big garden with nice sea view! Although the house is built for over ten years the last landlord is living tidily you can see it, reasonable price too basically, it fits the requirement you told me but the master's room is facing south east east is bad to you from the fung-shui's point of view, it'll harm the master by the way, the kitchen is bad too it locates on the west, it means you can lose money easily the toilet is facing south, it means it'll harm you heart and... Mister, you are exaggerating! As you said, why didn't the last landlord die? Sister Dan, for the matter of fung-shui, it is superstitious actually it is not scientific most important of all, you'd better ask yourself you like it or not I don't think so, for the matter of fung-shui, I do believe in it sister Dan, some people love threatening they intentionally threaten you, that's why you'll believe in him miss, you mean I am cheating? I just say the things I learnt from fung-shui books believe it or not, it's up to you I just advise miss yuen by the knowledge as being a property agent I do want to earn the commission but I won't be that heartless to ask my clients to buy a haunted house you sound reasonable, and sounds true I don't know how to make the choice honey honey? Where are you now? I am on the way, but I have to give my client a ride maybe, I will a bit later don't hurry! I can wait it's raining heavily, you must drive carefully you too, remember to turn on the headlight when you are driving I know, it is not my first time to drive see you later The black signal has been hosted by the royal observatory at 1 pm to warn a downpour until now, the fire services dept. Highway dept. And the police... A heavy rain storm is coming and the rain brings bad omen something bad will happen the heavy rain should cause flooding and landslide of course accident should happen! Well, sister Dan, recently there is a film it's a story about swindlers using fung-shui to cheat it's educational you may treat me as a swindler but I am telling the truth look at him, from his face, I can tell he will be harmed by water I am not lying men with such look will be bothered by sex and love. You must be in between you wife and your mistress if I said correctly, don't blame me of disclosing you secret as you said, I shouldn't go out whenever it rains and I shouldn't drink too, right? Look at your forehead is turning grey trouble will come, someone of your family will die in three days this is as much as I can say Mr. to, be careful!
