Mari, I want to get back in the water. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Let's go then. Careful... How was the house like, when grandma lived here? She liked to keep busy. She loved gardening. - Wasn't it like this? - No. Now it's so neglected. Since she left, it's never been the same. - Aren't you pleased we're back? - Yes. Do you remember me? Mom always told us about you, Mari. Did she? Careful! Your parents had a fight, right? Hush! I'm leaving now, Juana, okay? Alright. I heard your grandma left 'cause she hated bugs. No, she left because the house was flooded. - Isn't that right, Mari? - Yes. That's why she left. She said that after it flooded, it was full of snakes. No it wasn't. My Vale. Come here, Benja. I'm leaving soon. I'm thirsty. You can have some water in a moment. Don't worry, I'll be back soon. Call me if you need anything. OK, Vale? Yes. Everything will be okay. Sure. C'mon, search over here! Kids, don't go too far! Smells like diesel. It's a different color here. That's probably the junked machinery. That looks like a bone. What was the sign? A piece of brick, broken in half. Armando, you start on that side! Cross the fence! Look! He found something. Not that way, María! I'm coming! I'll take another look! There was a hole here. Come here, Mom! Why are you all alone? She says the smell of the pit, has stuck to her skin. That's what the psychic told her. Stop that nonsense! C'mon, everyone, time to go! Let's go, kids! Keep moving, please! Benja! No night guards and you sneak in, right? This is a restricted area! Let's go! Time to go. Let's go María, I'll wait at the gate. I'm coming. - You okay, Mom? - Yes. Mrs. Merce, time to go now. We're not looking for a lost dog or a car here. I didn't mention a dog, ma'am. It's time to go! Get a fucking move on! Are you idiots? Move it! - We'll be done soon! - No, time to go! No one stays here. Let's go! Move it, please! Next time, I'll have you and your big mouth arrested. Get in. Have a nice day, ma'am. There's nothing good about it. It's been a year since she went missing. It's all tense now because of checkpoints. Come back next week. Thank you, chief. Good bye. Hold on, Merce. I want a word with you. I know that... I can't imagine what you're going through. I'd like to help. I'm not sure how, though. You can count on me. Don't you worry dear, I'll be fine. Hurry up, Mom! Take care, my boy. You don't even sleep at home. You sound like a broken record, Mom! Oh, Adán! What about Jimmy? We used to play. Mom! What happened? Hurry up! I'll see to your eye. Are you okay, Mom? They wanted to adopt me... so I could live with them in the USA. They asked my parents, and told my folks I should go with them. My parents refused. Was Jimmy going to leave you his fortune? What then? Well, I wouldn't be here now. Do you regret it? No. You'd be a millionaire. I've never cared about... money. You wouldn't have me, either. True. Enough already... Is that too cold? Thanks, Mom. Where are you going? Adán! I'm talking to you, Adán! I told you I don't want this crap. Come on. What? Take your pants off. Take it all off. Your pants, off! This little earring. Your pants. - Are you for real? - Yes. All of it! Throw all this crap in the trash. Your pants! Come on, Mom, take it easy. Keep up your narco shit... and you'll be sleeping out here naked. Aren't you going to get cold? He was a good kid, responsible, no bad habits, didn't get into trouble... But at the end of the day, it was an accident. Yes, it was. There's nothing you could've done. Maybe the machine was too heavy for a boy. Yes, the pump was too heavy for him. Yes, it was. He started crying, he was so scared. I held him close to comfort him. Of course. Those memories can be painful. It breaks my heart. I'm still looking for him, I still miss him. Of course, but sometimes accidents just happen... Unexpectedly. Mari says lunch is ready. My mom's dress is pretty, isn't it? Was she married? It was just her and her daughters. What was she like? She used to smile a lot. What did she do for work? Honestly, I'm not sure. I heard she had a boyfriend, a taxi driver. But she never told us. Water is seeping through the walls. Why didn't she talk about it? Maybe 'cause she was covered in bruises. She felt embarrassed to let her girls see them. She was afraid. No one wants to talk. Mari, I can help you. If the taxi driver is a suspect, I could call a lawyer. I could ask. Let me know. Mari. I'm sorry, but you don't get how things work here. We see things differently. This isn't an AR-15, you idiot. They only sell that to broke morons. I'm glad they'll be discontinued. Who's doing that? The manufacturer, who else? I've heard you can't find them easily, you have to know how. Here's the thing... running guns into Mexico is a piece of cake. You just go to a gun show, show your interest and they'll sell them to anyone. - Even me? - Sure, the best... is to have a kid buy them. They just need a driver's license. If you're smart, you break a machine gun in pieces. You bring the stock, the scope, the barrel... If they inspect you or scan you, no worries, 'cause you're not carrying a gun. They're just parts, so no problem. I was at the border and got so nervous. Imagine if I'd been carrying a gun. It's only for the brave, son. Hey, cool it! What's up with that? - What's up? - It's almost ready. We're starving here! Sit the fuck down! Take it easy, man. Hey man, that shit's scary! Get the groin, he's got no balls anyway! Should I shoot him? Later dickheads. I'm off to see Gallo. I've gotta check out the taxi stand. Tell me a joke, or you're not going anywhere. Shoot your own eye out, God gave you two. Hi Bere, how are you? I hope you're okay and your daughter too. Listen... I'm sending you this message, you haven't come around, I'm worried. How's your pregnancy? I'm worried about you. Please call me. Let me know, okay? Well, goodbye. Everything okay, Mari? Yes, Adán. Everything's fine. - Were you talking to Bere? - Yes. Tell her to like my videos. I'll tell her. I told her, but who knows. - When are you leaving? - Soon. I don't know what time it is. Alright then. Should I store the food in containers? Yes, as usual. Can I leave a little bit more? Sure, but don't tell Atún, you know his temper. Yes, I know him. Okay, keep it quiet, Mari. Yes, Adán. - Take care. - Yes, goodbye. Lupe, tell my mom I'll be late. I didn't hear from my daughter for months. Then she sent me a message on Facebook: "Thanks for your messages, Dad, I miss you." - Name? - Alberto. Alright, wait over there. It's okay, sweetie, calm down. We'll follow you, officer. Is it my turn yet? I brought some pictures of her, but we didn't call ahead. They were coming from the USA, with some merchandise... Let me check your documents. That's when they were kidnapped. How old were they? 16 and 22. I already gave you that document. The youngest sent a text from the trunk. Where did she go missing? Hand me the copies, please. - Excuse me. - Go ahead. She went missing after school, near Jojutla... Relatives of Carlos Alberto Gómez Saldívar? I also need your son's picture. Carlos Alberto Gómez Saldívar. 35 years old. - And your ID. - Here. My address, birth certificate. I'm telling you! It's happened before... with other tests you've run... The bodies are just dumped like trash! Diego Quintero! Luisa Lemus! It's a blood sample. As you know, we find bodies every day. Unrecognizable corpses. Cases like your daughter's. But the description doesn't match... my daughter's features. My daughter is an 11-year-old girl. Why are you insisting? I already told you that... Diego Quintero! Luisa Lemus! Someone looking for Aníbal Aguilar? Family of Aníbal Aguilar! Could you repeat your name? Mercedes Villamil. Kinship to the missing person? She's my daughter. Our parents, our mother and father, brought us into the world. Once we are there, they can't handle us. All their attempts to do so are doomed. They soon give up... But by then it's too late. Whenever that moment arrives, they destroyed us long before. The first 3 years of our lives are critical, and yet our parents, our mother and father... are clueless, willfully ignorant, unable to learn. For centuries, everything has contributed to that ignorance. With that ignorance, our parents... have destroyed and annihilated us, continuously, and for the rest of our lives. It is undeniable that we will always find damaged people, who have been destroyed and annihilated for life in their early childhood, damaged by their parents, who are vile, ignorant, and unenlightened. Let me tell you something, son. You kids... Think you've invented the wheel. With all due respect, you think your shit doesn't stink. They say that miserable parents, breed miserable children. Right? As the saying goes... If idiots could fly, we'd never see the sky. Crazy people. Come on kids! Family! Odette, Ricardo, Diana, come here! No! Keep still for one moment. You'll all eat very soon. Isabel, please... Orlando, Ricardo, Odette, Isabel! Do you know where Isabel is? All the family is here. Come here, easy please. Does anyone know where Isabel is? Isabel! Can we eat? Very soon, sweetie. Listen to your uncle, he wears a beret for this! He looks very chic. It's time. - At one! - Look there! Two... and three! One more! Let's see. Smile like we're all happy! And three, two, one! OK, that's it. Do whatever you want but go away! Go and grow up elsewhere! Listen! Kids! There's lemonade over there! Tequila and mescal for the adults. Help yourselves. Okay, we're done here! Auntie, go over there, they're waiting for you. Be careful! Filthy bourgeois consumer pigs! Trash eaters! Off with their heads! You don't look so good, my love. You look terrible. I mean it! Doesn't country life agree with you? I'm happy I don't have to worry, about my appearance, Mom. You were such a young mother. That wears you down. Kids be careful! You'll break something. Dad told me you gave him a pill. I did, because I'm the one taking care of him, and the doctor said he needs to sleep. All I do is be a nurse. Family of fools! I'll never invite them again! I don't know why but we were all sick. Sick of something very serious... And we were going to die. And you said to us: "We should have a cup of coffee before we die." The liquid was hot and burned my tongue. To relieve the stress, because work also stresses you. Can you show me what you've done so far? I've just fixed the cracks in the wall. So it's obvious someone's living here. Thieves only break in if they think the place is empty. Go ahead. I'll catch up. Perfect. Ventura! How's it going, Benja? Ventura, I want to ask you a favor. Just don't ask anything I can't do. Those things you ask me, I'd prefer not to... Why not? You haven't done anything wrong. I don't want any trouble. You're the only one I trust. You've known me for a very long time. Well... I don't want any problem but we've known each other for a long time. Maybe I can help you. Thank you. We can discuss it later... Now, if you bring the waterproofing paint... I'll fix the cracks. Jesus, you outdid yourself this time. It's damn hot. I had to walk through a bunch of cornfields, and plots of land. Just look at me! I'm all sweaty and covered in weeds. Then some fucking dogs chased me. They wouldn't stop barking. I almost got caught when I got there. Get to the point! Yes, your son was there. He was with some other guys. Mrs. María was also there. I think she works with them. - María? - Yes. Mrs. Merce's daughter. She was there. Are you sure it was Adán? What's up, dudes? I have a new video and brand new tips. The last ones were a fucking disgrace. These ones are cool. I'll tell you about my bling, my threads, and my look. My kicks and the whole deal, so you can see... What are you recording that for? Cut that shit and record me! Your outfit man! We're standing around like idiots here. Get to the fucking point! You say the same shit over and over. You've said that four times! I'm not the one complaining! Focus, man. Give good advice. You can't be like, "Hey, dudes!" Remember, you're not just a YouTuber, you're an influencer! Fucking gardener. He holds my hand when no one's looking. Here's the guy who keeps my pitbulls, not to mention my bodyguard... Get the fuck away, leave my neck alone! What happened to your eye? Who gave you that shiner? Cut that thing off! Shut the fuck up. Keep fucking up, I'll give you another one. He's the one who fucked up! You can't just talk out of your ass! The problem is that your face looks like an ass too. How about a filter? Yeah, make it the dog filter! Lay down. His piss is starting to stink. I'll empty the bucket. María! How are you? Fine. Where have you been? I just got off work. - How are you doing? - I'm okay. We've been working to get rid of the thieves. - What's the matter? - Nothing, I'm fine. - Can I help you? - No. - I'm fine. - Are you? Is there anything you need? I'm fine. What is it? Nothing. Our wing-pin has arrived! Hand out sodas to everyone. Come on, Moi! Put some balls into it! Keep attacking! Gallito, the top dog! What's up, Atún? C'mon! Play like a man! Help yourself to a beer! Pass it, man! Go on, take the shot! Go for it! Cover that guy! Cover him! C'mon, Moi! Time to shine! Gallito is here, you fuckers! They're kicking our ass! Pass me a cigarette. C'mon Boss, show us how! - I don't have any matches. - No? That's our Gallito! C'mon team! Let's see this kid. I'm gonna have a word with this asshole. I'll get smashed because of you. What's up, man? You've got a big mouth. We're not impressed with your work, just so you know. Get your act together or I'll teach you a lesson. I'm gonna play now. I just forgot what I was going to say. Maybe we'll end up in jail, guys! Start saving up for your bail money. Are you going to take Mari to prison? No, they'll just ask her a few questions. - What's your name? - Benjamín. Good afternoon, Captain. Good afternoon, kids. Excuse me, how much is a gun like that? This is a 9mm Beretta. It's around a thousand dollars. It's possible to get one. Close to the border it's easier than by the books. - Can I take a look? - Sure. Careful, they want information. They're professionals. Check it out. What do you think, kids? - Want one? There's a way. - This shit is real! Yes. It has to be discreet, cautious. Have you ever been in a beauty pageant? No. You're very beautiful. So what do you say, kids? Do you want one? Very beautiful. Can I offer you a drink? Like what? Alcohol, obviously. I know all about the shit you've been up to. Who'd have thought a nice lady like you would become a kidnapper? I can fuck you up if I want to, María. Don't play stupid. What's the point? What did you do? - Nothing. - Nothing? Were you smoking? We did mushrooms. Mushrooms? - Magic mushrooms, Mom. - Vale! You said they were spirit guides, or some new-age bullshit. I said that? Yes. I'm afraid the police will notice. Don't worry. Benja didn't have any, did he? Of course not. What about your kid cousins? They're not little kids Mom, How are they? They're high as a kite. When I wake up, I feel scared. I can't get a peaceful night's sleep. I'd give anything to see my sister again. We've known each other since we were kids. I don't like to gossip about my people. Are they taxi drivers? Some are, and some aren't. The ones who aren't drivers, are just there to go wild. The taxi base is useless. They don't offer proper service. Have you thought about the favor I asked? You said we'd discuss it later, right? What do you think? It's a deal. Let's try it there. What do you think, Dad? That's perfect. Soon you'll be watching some cool movies here. Grandpa! Pass me the drill. Where is it? Grandpa! Do you watch porn, old man? I think it's great. I like it. Do you even know what porn is? Movies, isn't it? I'll show you some. What kind of movies do you like? The ones you said. For real? You want to help me? Mind your own business. Mom, don't be ridiculous. Mom... Mom, calm down. Dad! Turn the TV down! Dad! Turn down the volume! Turn it down, Dad! There used to be a bridge back there. We ran like crazy... the bridge was broken. Someone always fell in to the water. One had to run back with soaking wet shoes. Look! I want to show you something. I thought of you two when I saw this... And myself when I was a kid. Mari is taking care of us. I'm sure your mom is about to get home. I'm here whatever you need. I would love to be there. We miss you, Dad. I miss you guys too, very much. Sit up, Benja. I can't. Vale... I know where Mari's sister is. Did you dream it? Juana took me to a place near this house. But... I don't remember where it was. Don't worry. You're burning up. Do you want some water? I want Mom to come home. What was that? It's Juana. Did you change his clothes? Yes. The bandages on his face. Will you stay here, María? No... I don't know. I'll be here and see to it. Wasn't it someone else's turn today? They asked me to stay on again. Maybe you can leave us some food. Sure. Do you think the guy's too hot? I think so. I'll open a window in a while. That's fine. See you then, María. Bye, Adán. Vale! Vale, open the door. Vale! Open up! Please open the door, Vale. Vale? Vale, will you let me in? Vale. Open the door! Valeria! Open up! Open the door! Which girl is the lady looking for? I don't know, she's not making any sense. And... To be honest, we don't know who she is. I'll take your plate. Thank you, dear. She doesn't know who she's looking for, or what she's getting into. Thank you. They miss you. I lose track of time. I forget about my children. Valeria called her dad today... She told him you're never around. They never know where you are. I didn't know what to say. How are they now? Benja has been throwing up. Valeria won't leave her room. But they're calm. Could you stay tonight? You can leave early tomorrow. You're not going out again? I'm going to see the taxi drivers. They're expecting me. Be patient with me please. With due respect I'm worried you'll do something stupid. I'm sorry. I'm right here, Juana. I'm right here. Check them out. You wanted to come here, blondie. You're looking for someone, right? Don't move. Gordo, give us a moment. Get out, baby. My friends want to meet you. Come on, get out. She got lucky. She washed up and... it's like nothing ever happened. She was full of gunk. You don't want to file a complaint. Right? Think about it, Ma'am. What's wrong, Vale? Tell me what you're feeling. Did something happen? Vale? I don't like leaving Mom on her own. Why's that, sweetie? I'm not sure she can look after herself. Keep it calm. We'll call her, so you can hear her voice. How about that? Can you pull over! Dad... What happened? I can't come back... I want to quit work. Look at this one! I remember, we were at the beach. You were crying here. You must have hurt yourself. No, I hadn't fallen over. You were obsessed with taking pictures, and directed me: "Raise your arm, lower your leg, smile". That's why I was crying. So it's my fault you were crying? I guess so. It's hard to avoid scarring our children. As far as I know, there are no hard-set rules to deal with life's troubles. Thank you. Your husband called yesterday. He's always so thoughtful. He told me the kids will stay with him for a while. Yes, he misses them. He's always been a great dad, hasn't he? Please tell me what the doctor said. I have two displaced vertebrae. He says it was my childhood gymnastics. Who knows, maybe. That's nonsense! You hardly ever went to gymnastics, Isabel. It must be your country life. It's the gymnastics. I've had it since I was little. You've been bed-ridden for 3 months! I've been worried. I'm fine, Mom. It's over now. - I'm fine. - I'll get the soup. Remember what happened to your sister. Don't be such a coward, María. Your mother was braver than you'll ever be. I trust you, María, but the people... who work for me, are rotten apples. I don't want anyone to hurt you. When you say that, I don't feel safe. Don't be stupid. No one likes to be spied on. You're not helping your case, María. I've nothing to hide. The boys hear everything. You know what they're like. Please don't make them mad, María. I haven't done anything wrong. Chin up, no crying. Why are you doing this to me? You know you can't quit this job. It's not that easy. There must be a way. You knew this from the start. No, Ma'am, I didn't. I didn't know it would be so hard. I've known you since you were a girl. You've always known what this is about. I needed money, but not like this. Enough of your bullshit, María! - It's not bullshit. - Just do your job. That's what I'm doing, Ma'am. I won't say a word. Don't be such an idiot, María. Why are you calling me that? Good afternoon, Mrs. Aurora. - You called? - Yes, son. I need you to go to the market, buy some sodas, and some lunch, because it's getting late. And get something for the kids, too. - Sure. I'll be quick. - Here's some money. - See you later. - Bye. It's been 7 days since he's gone. You're a coward. Please find him. He's wearing red sneakers, boss. Any necklaces or earrings? Some small earrings. What does he look like? It's not him, boss. It's not him. Let me get you more information. Boss! Boss. - What is it? - Can you give us a ride? Sure, Paula. Let me get out of these clothes and I'll meet you out there. Thank you. I don't feel well, Mondo. I'm gonna get changed in the truck. Yes, boss. I'll take care of the corpse. Mom, are you there? Yes, I'm here. Vale, can you hear me? Mom, you've got bad reception. Vale? There you are, I can hear you now. Can you hear me? Reception's terrible, isn't it? Are you there? I lost you. Where are you, Mom? Can you hear me now? I'll call you when I get home, sweetie. I love you, Vale. I can't wait to see you, Mom. Wait, what the... - No, no! - Get out of the car, bitch! Wait! No, no! Get her out! Let's go! Shut the fuck up! Move it! Come on! Grab her! Let's go! Hold her hard. The boss knows what Adán's up to and she's okay with it. She hasn't said anything. You need to let go. Stop fighting it. No need to get upset about everything. Just turn a blind eye and let it all play out. Why let it bother you? The boss also said we have to help move the shipment. That's where we're going now, you moron. Enough of your fucking lectures. You always get pissed off! That's why I keep insisting. What's wrong with your boss? She's going through some shit. - Do we unload? - The merchandise is damaged. Close the trunk, man. So, will you take the shipment? That's why we're here. Do we see you again tomorrow? No, I have to help my folks. Help them pick limes. They grow lime trees. I have to help with the harvest and drive them. This isn't all there is to life. - Right. - They're my folks. Let me know about the next shipments. I'll send them with Chuchito or Chevro although they've been fucking up. I won't deal with them. Only directly with you. I know, man. They've fucked up. Three jobs and they fucked up already. They didn't learn to count in school. - What a fuck-up. - It was a mistake. A mistake? Don't give me that shit. Fire them and I'll do it myself. - You want to switch sides? - No doubt. - You sure? - Why not? - Do you have the balls? - You bet. Gentlemen, your order is canceled. Have a good afternoon, Gallo. Who the fuck does she think she is? Let's get the fuck out of here. We have strawberry sauce for your order we have mustard sauce, gravy... I recommend our caramel onion sauce, the marinara sauce. We also have oyster sauce, mint sauce, and of course our special sauce. We have a delicious red sauce, Green sauce! Hold on, please. Okay. We've known each other for 20 years, Roberta. What is this shit? After all this time. Get lost, before I beat you up. Stupid bitch. Remember, all our sauces are homemade. May I take your drink order? Horchata, please. Your address, please. 3, Martín Monzón St. Come on, sweetheart. Out. Get her sandals. Here you go. Today's your lucky day, babe. You're not my type. I prefer brunettes. Move it. Fuck off. Go on! Stop! Run, fucking blondie! Get back here, bitch! Look at her bolting! Help, please! Please, stop! Please! Please! Mom... I never want to see you again, stupid bitch. I'm quitting my gardener job. Did you get fired? No, I'm tired of it. I want another job. Are you planning to join the drum band? I don't like that kind of music. Right now, I'm just wondering, where will death find me. You never know. I'd say any place is a good place to die. Officer Yadiz, at your service. Thank you. I'll be on my way. Thank you, Officer. God bless you. Good afternoon. So, apparently... things are a bit more complicated. There's a... situation with your car. You've been accused of... I didn't get all the details. We'll have to fill out some forms, you'll have to make a statement. I spoke to the lawyer, Anzaldúa. You know him, right? He's sure he can handle it. Everything is ready. Let me know if you need help packing. - Thanks for everything, Mari. - That's all, Mari. - We'll talk later. - Whenever you want. Where's Benja? Have you seen him? I saw him in the morning, he was out in the garden. - But I haven't seen him for a while. - How come? I'll look for him. I'll see if I can find him. Okay, thank you. Benjamín! Benja! Valeria! I can't find him. He's not here. They found Benja. He was up on the hill. He was yelling down to us. He says he found some buried remains, with clothes on.
