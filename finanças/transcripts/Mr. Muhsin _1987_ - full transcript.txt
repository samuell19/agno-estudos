♪Muzeyyen Senar - Aglamakla Inlemekle♪ Screenplay Music Producer Director Muzeyyen... Just a dream. Didn't I fix you yesterday? [Speaks poor Turkish in foreign accent] Expects to rent a place at that rate? Morning, madam Agavni. How are you? What do you think? - Doing alright... How would I be alright? We were just talking... People think "She owns a huge building with many apartments." "Madame Agavni is rolling in money." I suppose... Hell no! What was sold for 1 sells for 10 a day after! Groceries, meat, heating... There's a rise in prices everyday! I don't have a husband. How can a widow make a living? Nobody cares! -You're doing well enough. What should we do? What about the middle class? You can't imagine how I put together the fuel cost of this car. Just take a guess. Good grief, will this landlord ever give a damn about this place. Stingy bastard. Who are you? It's me, Osman. What are you doing here? Did you forget the keys again? No. We were kicked out. Selahattin... Pour me a bitter one. What's up? You're early. My would-be assistant... Osman. Right, Osman. He bet six months worth of payment on horses. Six months... All on horses! ...and the landlord... Anger is making my tooth ache. Where should I put these? Back there. And then get lost. Osman, so you two have gotten kicked out? What's it to you? Go back to your gambling! You got this idiot into gambling too! Salam aleykum. Don't worry about it. You can run your business from here until you find a new place. You can use the phone. It wouldn't be appropriate. Coffeehouse is too good for you. You're being rude Sakir, we're in the same business after all. The same could've happened to you as well. Agha! What? I'm looking for Muhsin Kanadikirik. Is he here? [Mocking eastern accent] He's here. Right there! Don't look at me. You're fired! Salam aleykum. Aleykum Salam. My agha, you're Muhsin Kanadikirik aren't you? Yes. Thank god, found you at last! What do you want with me? A singer. -What? I want to be a singer. Fine, be my guest. No, you're going to make me. Are you crazy? Come on now. You'll remember now. I'm the nephew of Lousy Salman from Urfa Who's that? Lousy Salman. Your sergeant in the military service. It's been ages since the military. How could I remember? From his stinky feet. They would make the entire squadron pass out. Still not remembering? Stop pestering me, I don't remember. What if I did? Here's what. My uncle Lousy Salman once said; "Never trust anyone but only Muhsin Kanadikirik" That's what he said and then gave me your address. Mashallah, your address haven't changed for 20 years. I'd find you either way. -Enough! Shut it! You're giving me a headache! Shut your trap! I can't make you a singer. The management office has been shut down. Now scram! Agha, one tea please. Come here. What are your orders? Did we get the payment for the ceremony job? No, just give me the word! Cut the crap. Just go and get it. Make sure it's full. Welcome my agha. I was looking forward to see you. Why are you following me? Pardon me my agha. Stop calling me "my agha"! As you wish. Go away already! My uncle once said Don't get me started on your uncle, you pest! Go away! But what about my singing career? So this is how a killer is made. I'll kill you this time. Hope I'm not intruding, do you have some tomato paste? I think so. Forgive me for imposing on you every evening. I owe you a pack of margarine. Oh, please. You're single too, you'd understand. I can't take care of it, I forget even when I make a shopping list. Did you hear the latest? No? I'm suspicious of that piece of shit woman. Excuse me, which woman? My girl's sitter. When I'm over at the club, She puts my girl to sleep and brings men inside! Oh? You know how I figured it out? I've found men's underwear! None of us would wear it, so where does that leave us? I asked her where did it come from. She's playing dumb, trying to fool me... How are you doing? Water is livening you up. What is it? What did you say? Alright then, as you wish. I'll play music more regularly. And you? How are you Ms. Sevda? Don't let the others know but, I'm playing Safiye Ayla just for you. I want you to you know that, I have special feelings for you. Persistent bastard! He's still here! Bloody hell. Here we go, anger triggers my tooth pain. God, you're sending your curses in pairs. Me? Calling for me? Did you call me, my agha? Get inside it's going to rain. You'll die of cold. Let me kiss your hand. You've become a stray dog already. Please my agha. Don't you have a room stay? -I have actually. But I looked at the weather and figured it's going to rain. "If I wait in the rain, my agha would take pity on me and take me inside." Was I right? You deceitful Urfa man. I should throw you out! As you wish. What is it my agha? It's my tooth again. It's getting worse! It's empty. And pharmacies are closed. No toothanol. No thyme oil. My agha what are you doing with those? What the hell do you think? For my tooth. Ask the neighbours, if they have toothanol. As you wish. Do you have toothanol? Who the hell are you coming here at this hour? Stop this pain already! Stop! What are you doing Mr. Muhsin. My tooth is acting up. Been living with this for 10 years. I don't have the medicine but I've got raki. Thanks, better than nothing. But I can't open it. Let me try. Muhsin abi how are you holding up? Do you have toothanol? No, but I've brought cologne. I've got thyme oil. Open this cursed bottle. My dear Madam, apply it right here. Wider. I've got two aspirins. That's all we have. Give. Couldn't you open the bottle? I got it. Drink this much raki? He'll be poisoned. God forbid. If he wasn't afraid of dentist, my friend would remove it in a second. Don't bring up dentists, I'll never go! Who is it? Do you know the dentist? Do you know the dentist? [Singing a well-known turku from Urfa] No longer will you torture me you lousy tooth. My agha. How is your tooth? It's throbbing a little. The damn tooth had a huge root like this. Did you take me there? -Yeah. Carried you on my shoulders. Shoulders? Why didn't you get a cab? The money is running dry. What then? It's up to you. Don't you have parents or anyone? My mom is dead, we were 5 siblings. Maho, Ahmi, Yasho, Ali, Ibo. 3 died as a kid. Father sold all his land, living with my brother. We don't get along. They gave me a beating when they heard I wanted to be a singer. I was a child then. And then one day, I ran away. Long story. Long story. Anyway, my uncle said. "If you insist, you should go to Muhsin Kanadikirik." Yeah, Lousy Osman. Lousy Salman. Muhsin abi, Nedya Senay called. Now we're screwed, what do we tell her? Some has-been called you. Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you. Welcome my agha. How is your tooth? Would you like a coffee? Sure, get a tea for yourself. Looks like Ali Nazik softened you up. Don't ask. He carried me to the dentist on his shoulders. And brought me back after my teeth was pulled. - Wow. He told me his story. Poor guy, it'd break your heart. He's got such a beautiful voice. Just like Ibrahim Sesiguzel. Ibrahim Tatlises. Who? The guy you mentioned. Right, Ibrahim Tatlises. He can be big with some handholding. Ibrahim Tatlises? No, you knucklehead. Our guy, Ali. We'll hold his hand. Why don't we? We? We can't even take care of ourselves. Don't say that abi, give us a chance. Who doesn't find to discover new talent?* It's probably eating you up. Ibrahim used to do construction work. Started out in nightclubs, now look where he is. Did he do it by himself? We can't. We don't even have an office. We are about to go bankrupt. And why? Because we don't have a famous singer. You can make him famous. You are also indebted to Lousy Salman. Your comrade. Can we do it? We can do it. Kanadikirik Organization Presents Ali Nazik... But I won't let him be wasted in bars and nightclubs. We should play big. With a new spirit. Aim for the top. Come on what else do you want? You're trying to trick me! I swear on my life man... Look at this chair, its legs are all weird. It's perfect, believe me. How can it be good. Look at it, jiggling all over. For God's sake, do you think I'm lying? This is not okay. It looks like crap. You'll get paid once the job is over. The job is done sir. It's not done until we say so. Don't get me started on your chair, you don't know shit. I know all about chairs. Like hell you do, this is my job. I've been a carpenter for 30 years. Forget it. Do a crap job and then... You are Muhsin. Yep, Muhsin. He told me "he can start today" but I insisted that he listens first. No favoritism. He can listen first and decide for himself. We're starting fast, I've got news. What is it? I've talked to a producer from TRT. He's producing a show on amateurs. We'll get Ali Nazik on TV. TV? -Don't let anyone hear. TV, huh? That's some news. We'll be unstoppable. Goddamn you! Once I get my hands on you. Mommy! Mommy! Come here you little! Ms. Sevda. Please, don't be angry. She painted her face with make-up, look! Looks like a clown! She's a good kid, she was just playing. Get the hell inside! But you won't beat me. I told you to get the hell inside! I'll burn your hands! I'll send you to your father's! Her father is in prison in Germany. She has no clue. Or that we're divorced. I say "I'll send you to your father's" if she does mischief. She hates him but the bastard loved her. I wanted to send a message to Arab Cemal. My boss? My friend here is going to take stage at his place one night. Sure, Arab Cemal wouldn't say no to you. He gave me the job on your request, I won't forget it. Please, don't even mention it. I'll let him know tonight. He's a singer, huh? Turku singer. Not yet, we'll see. Maybe. God willing. We'll give it a shot. Good day. Move. He's here. This is the man I was talking about. Sir, greetings. Please. For bestowing such a great Cut the crap. Is this the singer? No, the mustached guy over there. Do we stand here? Oh, please. Please, take a seat. What would you drink? Coffee or tea? Is the money ready? What money? Didn't you tell him? Didn't I tell? What didn't you tell? This man here... I want 50 thou. He'll get a spot on TV for 50 thou. I didn't know. Now you do. We have to think it over. Think well. You have one minute. There are 30 guys on the line, for double the price. Sure but, you are squeezing us. 40 seconds remaining. Alright. I think I have enough. What are you doing idiot? Didn't you ask for money? 50 thousand liras. Announce it to everyone, why don't you? You'll get me fired. Oh, no. Let's go outside then. No, we can't do it outside. I am being followed. Let's go to the men's room. You best hand it over under the table. Here you go. Don't move. I got it. Thank lord, it's over. I'm not counting. I trust you. I'll call you. Drink a tea on us. You moron, why didn't you tell me he asked for money? What are you pulling off this time? He looked suspicious. I swear, I'm not pulling off shit. He's solid, don't worry. We're penniless. Try to scrap some money together. Nobody wants to spend any these days. I've got to go. Whatever I do it's not enough. You can't help this guy. We'll become homeless to make you a singer. No. Okay, I won't send the has-beens. But don't delay our advance. Come on abi. I'll get you a belly dancer too. How are you doing? You look fine. I'm fine too. Business is as usual. Joy of your times has long since gone. But we get by. We've found a new guy. Turku singer. Ali Nazik. Good fella. I decided to give him a hand. A big club owner is going to listen to him. We also arranged a TV appearance. We'll see. God willing. But of course nobody matches up to the great old singers. You would put everyone to a trance. How many times I sneaked out of the house to listen to you. How many times I got beaten, returning from one of your films. How elegantly you would hold the mic, and how beautifully you sang. "Why did I Love that Cruel Woman?" Hakki Derman, Serif Isli, Sukru Tunar, Selahattin Pinar, Yorgo Bacanoz... and you. Maybe it was you who made me get into this business. Maybe it was because of you, I never married. You've picked the wrong guy. Muhsin is done for. He's out of fashion. He doesn't have a single decent artist. Use your head, don't be stupid. He can't help you. I have bars, clubs and nightclubs. You can start in one of them yeah? Yes, I'm still not married. Maybe because I'm a manager. It's hard to find someone, after knowing you for so long. There's someone actually. We're in the same building. I mentioned her before, Ms. Sevda. I didn't tell her about my feelings. To be frank, I'm scared. She's a bit crazy and she curses a lot. She's a divorcee. You are probably thinking, what's there to like about her? I thought that too. Finally figured it out. She looks like you. My agha, tell it to me straight. I'm just a simple Ali Nazik. Not even a singer yet. I'm a poor boy. Why would someone like you have anything to do with me? All of your singers are famous, you have crap ton of money. What do you want from me? I have no issue with you, but with Muhsin. Muhsin is disappearing. He's working in a coffeehouse now. It'll get even worse. But you have been a source of hope for him, he latched on to you. He started living again. He's not aware of this yet. Now I will take you away from him. In return, I'll give you what you want. Fame. Why do you hate my agha so much? Long story. Story about a woman. Singer. She left me. For Muhsin. Never mind, you'll hear about it someday. I'm about to sign with a big club. And I'll go on TV. So I can't Thank you. God bless you. You will come Ali Nazik. You will come. Of course I will come. Would I ever leave you alone? Agha, have a taste. Looks good. Oh no, what is this? Cig kofte. Not talking about that. It's too hot! I've only sprinkled a bit. What's this, are you trying to kill me? You people turned beautiful Istanbul into a kebab salon. Chili Adana, Chili Urfa, Chili Lahmacun. Istanbul stinks of kebab. What the hell is this? What about our beautiful cuisine. My agha why do you say that? If Istanbul didn't want it, these places wouldn't open. You have a tongue on you as well. Work on your singing rather than answering me. Laz Nurettin is coming tomorrow. You better pray he'll like you. God willing, that's as good as done. So do want Cig kofte or not? Oh no. Keep it. Agha, should I sing one arabesque piece tomorrow? No. No arabesque. If you want to sing arabesque you can beat it. Okay, my agha don't be angry. No arabesque it is. [Singing an Ibrahim Tatlises song] Don't you have any turkus of your own? Sing those. That's how you can sing from heart. And sing beautifully. Agha, if this thing works out... Yeah, you'd be rich. Please my agha, us both. Vinyls, TV, clubs... Maybe star in a movie? Oh boy! We'll get you a beautiful car. Sahin for instance. No, I'd rather not. If we make a lot of money, I can get a place in Uskudar. With a view of Maiden's Tower. I had enough of Beyoglu's hassle. I'd close down a kebab place, they will only serve me. I might take up beadwork again. Set up banquets with old friends. I'll buy a silk shirt. Pink. A white suit on top and a gold chain. Just like Ibrahim. I can get Mrs. Afitap out of the nursing home. I'll get together with a bunch of woman, they can eat me up! I'd call Ms. Sevda as well. If she likes of course. Have you ever heard a worse voice? Come on, it's not that bad. I'm keeping her for your sake. She doesn't visit tables. Broad thinks she's a diva. Just keep up with it. You like her that much? Where did that come from? Laz Nurettin is here. Welcome abi, please. How are you Celal? Getting by. We're thankful. Muhsin's here? Muhsin! Welcome. Come on you, take a seat. What would you like sir? Whisky. I'll cost you tonight! -Don't mention it. [Singing out of tune and sync] Thank you. Welcome. We're talking business here, try another table. Have a Whisky on me if you want. Hey jerk, I said welcome, did I ask for a drink? Did you think I was a whore, you creep? Thank you for the flowers. Please, don't mention it. Damn she's a mean one. Broad was about to kill me. Shall we listen to our guy? -Sure let's hear. [Singing a sad turku] You fool, even I would have done a better job. He was making fun of you. "Even the waiters at my place sings better than him." Skip all that but how can you forget the lyrics? It was the pressure! Thought I was gonna die! I wish you did! How nice you were singing on the roof. You're all talk. "God willing, that's as good as done." Would God care about that voice? You are being too harsh to the kid. What would that creep know. His breath stinks of garlic, I hate garlic! Me too. - Me too. You shut up! Maybe I should have sung arabesque. Shame on you. Arabesque, huh? Still going on about arabesque? You're fired, beat it! Sing arabesque where ever the hell you want. Get lost! Yes, Mr. Muhsin? Sorry to disturb you. We've send the boy away but now I'm worried. Something might happen to him in this big city. Maybe I should go to the police. Did he tell anything to you? Where have you been? You fired me my agha. You should let me know, you buffoon! Move! As you wish. Good evening. I'm doing this for the sake of my sergeant, what was his name? Lousy Salman. Right, just because he entrusted you to me. He was a good sergeant, good times... Oh boy. Ahmet came home drunk... Please, nobody is calling you old. There's no work. Sorry but I can't let you in a nightclub. You have a reputation. I'll figure something out. Thanks, Selahattin. If it wasn't for you we'd be in real trouble. How will we ever repay you? Thanks for letting us use the coffeehouse as an office. Don't mention it. How about a coffee? No, thank you. Don't look at me like that, I'm not betting on horses. What about the office? Way over our price range. What the hell are we going to do? Business is running out. No office, Ali Nazik's tryout didn't work out. No news from TRT. Maybe we should take a shot at cassette tape or vinyl business. Nobody wants to make cassette. Even a basic cassette release costs 2 mil. Who can take that risk for a newcomer? We can try the contest he mentioned. -It's a long shot. We have no options. There's TRT. They'd want a tape as well. I have a feeling I can win this. What's the entry fee? 50 thou. Listen my boy, It's very important how an artist holds the mic. This is a mic. You old this firmly with your hand. Not too hard. Hold it softly, at this range. And while you sing, you can keep tempo with your other hand like so. I'll show you. [Singing Turkish classical music] Now you sing, just like I did. Hold it straight. Relax your hand. And your elbow... Raise your elbow a little. Keep your head straight. You're waving your hand too much. A performer should have confidence. If you take your job seriously, audience will too. Confidence will make you sound better. Agha, my hand moves by itself. ...to be a good singer, understood? Where's the minced meat? You should be healthy too. No smoking or drinking. I truly believe that you'll win this contest. You probably won't even have competition. The real work starts after winning the competition. Ali Nazik! What the hell are you doing? Nothing. Throw that away. Hey! What are you doing? How are you? What is it Mr. Muhsin, do you have laundry? That's right. Here for the laundry. Your laundry is always brilliant, just like snow. I never use detergent. Powder soap is the only way. Tomorrow... Our guy is entering a contest. What guy? Ali Nazik, to a turku contest. Oh really, that's amazing. Would you look at that. I've got two things for the contest. Only if you like of course, wouldn't want to impose. Two invitations. But unless... Oh, you are inviting me! But of course I'll come. So exciting, imagine him winning now! Can you believe it? You know what, I've had a feeling about that boy. Especially with your help. Fame is not easy to get, but with your help... I'm leaving. Don't worry. Just relax and sing nicely. You'll win this, believe it. We'll make this tape. Don't go my agha. Don't leave me. I'm feeling sick. I'm scared. Don't be afraid, you are the best. I've seen them in the rehearsals. Come on, we got this. We got this, right? We got this. This is as good as done, we'll get the first place. Not even second. I've made offerings to Salt Father. Please God! How is my make-up? Good, very excited! My make-up? No, Ali Nazik. Poor boy is very excited. Please God, do us a solid. Let us have this album. Ladies and gentleman, dear listeners, Welcome to Seda Records' annual singing contest. There are be 3 categories this year. In addition to Turkish classical and folk, we have arabesque. I'll be announcing the contestants... Normally there wouldn't be an arabesque category. As if we can't do without it. It's very popular, people want it. Every major artist is switching to arabesque, even I'm considering it. I don't understand your hatred for arabesque. We'll start things off by arabesque. First contestant, Little Nuran. Now we've got the "little" fad, what's "little" about her? She's almost my age. Maybe we should have added a "little" on our guy too if it's so popular. Next up is folk music. First contestant, Aynur Ince. We're at the end of the road. Our great jury, evaluated the performances with surgical precision and care. And here are the results. On this card I'm holding, written are the names of the first 3 in folk music. The third place is... Hamdiye Taskiran. The second place is... Serafettin Kumcu. And now for the, the winner of folk music category. A new fame in Turkey. A new star on our stages, on our vinyls and films. Yes, with your applauds. Please, applaud with energy, altogether. Yes... Announcing now; You knucklehead! Excuse me Ms. Sevda. -Please. You son of a bitch. I told you not to get worried. It's always my fault. You've heard it, it was fixed. Winner was an associate of the record label. Why do I care? You still sang poorly. Oh God, kill me! We can only hope! -God forbid! Congratulations on first place. So what, we almost got it. Only missed it by two points. It was a fixed anyway. Sure it was. Don't mind him. It all depends on TV, once you get on TV you'll have many followers. TV is truly a strange thing, it can make someone famous overnight. Still haven't found an office? Promise you won't beat me. It's alright if you couldn't find, don't be upset. We've been scammed. What? We've have been scammed, the guy was wasn't from TRT. He scammed 80 people the same way. But you said? It said TRT on his card. God damn you! You've ruined me, you've destroyed everything. You've promised not to beat me. You're still beating me! Beat you? I'll kill you! I'll wipe you out this time! You're wringing my neck! -To kill you! Don't touch them, let them kill each other. We couldn't hack it. Wasn't meant to be. Forgive me. Please my agha, even my father wouldn't do what you did for me. It didn't work out. Must I go back? I can't let you be wasted in bars and nightclubs. It would be a shame to let you in that filth. Maybe I can do something else. You won't be able to, you are too invested now. Whatever you say. I'll continue as a waiter, back in Urfa. I'll let loose and sing on the occasional event. So it will be. The bus is here. Osman agha, thanks for everything. Goodbye. You too my agha. You'll write me, right? Aw man, we've gotten really used to him. What a shame, we couldn't do it. Did you see how sad he was? You know he rejected Sakir's offer. -I've heard. I won't let this go, so long as my name is Muhsin. Go! Where are we going? Hey, stop! Pull over! I won't let you go. We'll make this tape. I'll do it personally. But there's no money. I'll find it, one way or another. We'll make a smashing tape! We'll get this tape made! The bus is leaving! Let it go. My bag is on the bus, my agha! Get in the car! Muhsin abi is here. Why don't you let him in? Come in my agha. Muhsin, oh Muhsin. I've been very upset since that day. I was worried If I offended you. Not at all, you only shared your opinion. Bring us tea. I have a request from you. Your wish is my command. I need money to make the tape. How much? 2 million. For that turku singer? -Yes. He won't amount to anything. I'd give it if you want it for yourself. Why do you care? I'm making the tape. You have to be sure of your investment. You don't need to think about that. Will you give me the money? I'd give my life for you. I'd even entrust you the business here. But you can't manage, and we'll lose money. I wonder if you remember, back in our youthful days. We were listening to Muzeyyen. And drinking wine. Marmara Wine. Don't know how it came about but we decided to become blood brothers. The scar is on my finger. Goodness, how many friends I have. It's my bad luck. Every guy from Urfa become famous except me. Who else can I ask? Am I missing someone? You won't make this tape. That's for me to decide. You won't, wanna bet? This is not a betting matter. Typical of you. Take a look at the guy you are counting on. He's all tripe. Wanna bet? I'll bet! I'll make this tape! What are the terms? You decide. If you release the tape in 2 months, I'll cover every expense. But if you can't, I'll take Ali Nazik is mine, deal? Deal. Arabesque of love. Crippled beggar, took away the blind beggar's wife. Get the door. What's this song, it's killing my mood. Where's Muhsin? He's here, let me get him. She's here. -Who? Mrs. Sevda. Why didn't you tell me right away? Please, would you like to come in? No, I'm late. Now please listen, don't be offended. What is it? The boss was talking, you were looking for funding for some tape business. Anyway, I have some savings. Thank you, but we already have to money. Is that true? I swear. I'd be offended. If you are ever in trouble... alright? Thank you. You are very kind. Yep, that's me. Alright then, so long. Money falls into our lap but the dude is not taking it. My agha why did you lie? She was ready to give us the money. It wouldn't be appropriate. How can we take a widow's savings for adventure. Then find it. We have no money. No money, god damn it! Maybe I could enter another contest. Maybe I could... Agha. Let us organize the contest. What contest. You know, turku and all. Let us organize the contest and then with the money make... Fund the tape. Would it work? It's almost noon and nobody is here. How can you organize a contest from a coffeehouse? If only we had an office. Maybe we gave the wrong address. Check the paper, we gave a huge ad. Paid a ton. Kanadikirik Organization Presents Skip over that, check the address. Application at Selahattin Coffeehouse, Beyoglu, 42nd street. Alright that's correct. I have no luck. Must have born on the wrong day. Someone's here. Make yourself spare, don't let them see you. Did you fix the jury? -Shut up, he'll kill us both. Don't worry about it, you'll win. Now go. You write down the entrants. I'll collect the money. All ready? Receipts, list of entrants, numbers and money box. Do I apply here for the song contest? Yes. How much is the entry fee? Turn that radio off I can't hear myself think. My agha, how much do we have? What's it to you? You just focus on winning. Or forget the tape. First place will be Ali Nazik's. Let this be known. Don't expect any favors from me. No my agha, as long as it's fair, that's good enough. Could it be Ms. Sevda? We are screwed. Back once again with news of a catastrophe? We can forget about the tape. The money we got only covers funding for the contest. And we still owe the paper for the ads. Is it that expensive? It's even more expensive, but they've made a discount for you. We can't both organize the contest and fund the tape with this money. If only we accepted arabesque singers we'd have enough. There are many of them. I won't allow it. How do we make the tape then? We won't. It wasn't meant to be. We couldn't hack it. Whatever we do, we fall short. Keep trying to peddle oldsters then... We've almost made it too... What are you doing in the middle of night? Singing my final turku. Then I'll jump off and kill myself. Why do you have the money box? I'll jump off with them. Ali Nazik will die and be showered with money. That's not our money, give me the box and then jump off. I've never had money. I didn't go to school. I was washed dishes as my friends went to nightclubs, whorehouses. I have no money. Worse singers have made it big but I'll still rolling around in dirt. All because of money! You'll fall down you idiot! I'm worried about the money. I'll jump. I'll throw myself off. -Stop you idiot! Throw... Agha. Agha... This is too high! I'm getting dizzy. My agha, please. I beg you, please take me. God damn you! Why did you get up on the roof, if you're afraid of heights? My agha I'm going down. Come quick! Don't open your eyes. Do not move! You buffoon! I don't like heights. Killing yourself wasn't enough, you wanted to kill me too? Where are you? I'm here, follow my voice! Don't move. When I grab you, don't pull me. Or we'll both go down. My agha, hold me. Hold me, I can't stand any longer. Now we must walk in sync. I'll walk backwards and you'll move forwards, okay? Don't open your eyes. -I won't. One, two... One, two... You earned a good beating. Kill me if you want. But don't tell me you won't make the tape. This is not our money. It's collected from hundreds of poor fellas, just like you. They all hope to be singers. Don't you have pity for them? How would we do that? Consider it a loan, we'll pay them back later. I saw the tape in my dream every night. Standing on the shelves. With my photo on the cover. Agha. I'll die if you won't make this tape. I swear, I'll die. They are all here. I feel bad. Don't give me that! We've already given half of the payment. Performers are here. You've been rehearsing for days. Don't screw this up now! Soon the bomb will drop anyways... Lord, forgive our sins. Contest is here right? -What contest? The singing contest, no? -There's no contest here. There's no contest. -What? -That's what he says. You doing alright? Greetings abi, thank you. So many equipment... Right. Give us our money back! Let us talk to someone, explain what's going on! Hold on gentlemen. Let me through. Excuse me. Stop, men! Just listen to me for a minute. Our club has nothing to do with this event you're talking about. Organizers are the ones who scammed you! Go find them! Same time tomorrow. How was it? Fine. Recordings should finalize tomorrow, right? Yes. And we'll get our money? Of course, that's what we agreed on. What are you doing? You better run abi. Don't push me! The police is looking for you. Run, quick! The police is after us. -Yes, that's right. What the hell do we do now? Quiet, I'm thinking. Don't panic. Where are we going? -Who knows. We're just going. I think I've heard something. It's freezing. It's too cold. No heating either. What would you expect. If only I could sell it. Who'd buy this? We'll get caught tomorrow anyway. We'll be at the studio tomorrow. Nobody knows the place. No agha, they'll find us. We couldn't do it after all. We'll do it this time, your tape will be released. We'll win the bet. You're dreaming. You're sputtering hogwash. We've become stray dogs, what tape? What the hell are you saying? I've risked my life for this thing! I'm sacrificing my reputation! Why? For you, you jerk! And myself. To do something through for once! The tape will be released, don't ever say no. Never! My agha this is too high! Just close your eyes. But then I'll fall! -Then open them! Hold my hand I'm scared. They are here! You idiot, turn that off! They'll see it, move! Don't run! Surrender yourselves! Don't run! Psst, over here! Come in, quick! Do not run! Come here. -Where? Quick! This way. Hide. Get in here! Get in there quickly! Sorry to disturb you. Oh, you are a police officer. What is it? We're looking for a con man, he just ran up the stairs. What's is to me? Could he be inside? Are you insane what would he be doing here? My husband is a boxer he'd break his bones. Nuri! It's just the police. Alright, sorry to disturb you. Good day. He left, you can get out. What the hell do we do now? We'll wait for a while and leave. Mom. Goodness, you scared the crap outta me. She comes in the morning to sleep with me. I'm sick of it! Let's go. The place is teeming with cops. [Both] We should go, we'll get you in trouble. I'm well past that, don't you worry about it. You should rest now, you look awful. Mrs. Sevda... Mr. Muhsin don't be silly, police came and left. Take this blanket and sleep on the sofa a bit. And I'll find some chair. Oh no, this is a huge bed. More than enough for both of us. This bed? I'll get you some pajamas. Please don't bother. Mr. Muhsin please, don't be a stranger. Just sit down there. And take those off. Are the pajamas comfortable? Yes. My ex-husband's. Good thing I didn't throw them away. What's is this, your girl's doll? My doll. Her name is Nazo. I'm scared all alone at nights. I can only go to sleep if I hug Nazo. Did you hear the cops? There's nothing, just lie down! I'm embarrassed. Don't be, I'm sure you had your reasons. You're an honest gentleman. You know how I worked my ass off to become famous. You could've had me with promise of fame. Not that I would refuse. But you didn't. People like you are going extinct. Take care of yourself. You are not a con man. I'd recognize a dishonest man with a glance. Where? I'll give myself up. How long can this go on? I'm tired. I have to pay the price. The money is here. Tell him to finish the job with Osman. It's almost done anyway. Keep an eye on this chump. Don't let him do something wrong. Don't go. Don't forget to water my flowers, alright? Speak to them while you do it, they will listen. Ms. Sevda... God save you. God save you. Thank you. Welcome. How are you, my agha? Fine, I'm alright. How are you all? URFA TURKUS So it's released. Yeah. How are the sales? Not bad. Not bad. But they say the next one will do better. Who? -Sakir abi. I'll leave these with the guard, we also brought food. Give me the tape. How are you Ms. Sevda? Fine, she's fine, alright. I'm fine. You still have time to do, right? Yes. Is it tough inside? Only because of yearning. I'm used to it otherwise. The guard will them to you Muhsin abi. Let's be on our way, huh? Okay get going now. Or I'll get used to you. Do you need anything? No. We'll be back. -Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Is this the tape? The one and only. Give me that radio thing, what's its name? Walkman. Let me put it on. So this is the famous Ali Nazik. Ali Nazik... Do I press this? Mr. Muhsin! Welcome back! Thank you, Madam. How are you? Not well at all. They are demolishing our house. Here too? Everywhere. They are demolishing entire Beyoglu. I'm going to Paris but all my memories are here. In every corner of this place. They will all be destroyed now. All of them. Look at the state of this place. This is on you Ali Nazik. He left with the... With that nightclub woman. Sevda or something, you know, the one with the kid. Flowers are dead. All of them. Back in the day, once you gave them a good spot, with decent sunlight, they would blossom like mad. But now with the same sun at the same place... they require synthetic fertilizer. Once you give them a few grams of potassium, the bastards flourish. But soon after that, they perish. Farewell Madam. Sell my furniture, it should cover what I owe you. My vinyls too, if anyone buys them of course. If not, just throw them away. Yes, that'd be fine. However you like it then, okay sweetheart. I'll call you later. Welcome back Muhsin. -Welcome Muhsin abi. Forgive me, I couldn't visit. Look what I've brought. We've made a bet, right? I won. But I've heard you got Ali Nazik. And transferred Osman. Ms. Sevda too. And? Didn't I win? Alright, I'll leave them all to you. You're right, I'm not cut out for this work. You deserve them more than me. Sakir. I didn't get your girlfriend, believe me. And I didn't even touch her. She left as she came. [Arabesque music] Did they say anything about me? They said "let her wait". That son of a bitch Sakir lied to me. Fact of the matter is, if you don't visit tables, there won't be work. You can't make me. What else are you good for with that crow voice of yours. You jerk, now I'm a crow? Fuck off you cursed broad. My agha? Are you out? Welcome back, please. I've come to listen to you. How did I do? Did you like it? You've switched to arabesque. Yeah, people want it. Turku, arabesque, everything. Like Ibrahim. Yeah, just like him. What about notes and solfège? Scrapped it. Getting by fine like this. Would you like Whisky? You shithead. I'll kill you if you touch this woman again. Isn't this bad for the child Ms. Sevda? My agha, forgive me. I had to save myself. Well, did you save yourself? Mr. Muhsin! Can we come? Only if you take that thing off your head. Fancy that, started up on the first try!
