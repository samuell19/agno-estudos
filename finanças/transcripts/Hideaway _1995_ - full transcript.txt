So... if there's anything wrong with you, it's not physical. Well, so, what was it? An acid flashback? Yeah, yeah. Trippy. Bad. After what you've been through, i'd be surprised if you weren't having nightmares. Wait a second. He's never had nightmares like this before. No. I wasn't asleep. Has this ever happened to other people you've resuscitated? I can't compare hatch to any of my other patients. Why not? Only one other was down as long as he was. Oh. Well, was there anything, uh, like this? Maybe i should talk to that other patient. I'm afraid that's not possible. - He's dead. Oh. Well, uh, that's encouraging. But not... no, n-Not from having been... dead. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Of course not. You shocked my wife. Hatch, look. God's given you a second chance at life. Try to enjoy it. Oh, yeah, yeah.

Nice picture of you, though i thought satan's looked better. Something else, marion, dear? Well, um, now that you mention it, i, um... I wondered, um, What it was like to, you know, be on the other side. What you saw there. Oh, just, uh... Uh, chemical brain... It's really scientific, you know? "Scientific"? I think there's a lot more to it than that. What's this, marion? It's a friend of mine. She's a very special person. She sees things. Oh, no, no, marion. She can help you remember things if you want. You know i'm not into that kind of stuff, sweetie. Well, maybe it's time you reconsidered, hatch. Okay. Thank you. Way to go, marilee. Honor student, former girl scout troop leader...

You didn't find the girl? There is no girl out there. This is all in your imagination, Isn't it, mr. Harrison? At least i hope so. What's happening, hatch? What's going on? Come on, honey. This is scaring the shit out of me. Oh, lindsey, i'm scared. Oh. Come here. Come here. Tell me. When i'm in it, It feels like i'm doing it. But like it's, uh, not me. And when i see light, it hurts my eyes. And, uh, i feel all this... Rage. My wife and i had another daughter, samantha, Who was killed in a hit-And-Run incident about a year ago. And when i was dead, i think i saw her. Maybe i really went someplace. 'Cause i feel like... maybe she's trying to warn me... Or trying to help me save people's lives. It's the hardest thing, to lose a child. I'd like to schedule in another pet scan. But... Could my situation be... You mean, could it be more spiritual in nature? Hatch, i don't know. It's not my field. Yeah. I really want to go, but, um, I just don't think it's a really good idea. I mean, he's really on edge. Dying and all, you know. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, okay. Come pick me up in like 30 minutes, okay? All right. Bye. Regina. Regina. He's kinda cute, huh? What? He's kind of cute. Yeah. Regina. Oh! I've seen you. No, i don't think so. Oh, yes, i have seen you. It was... like... A flash forward in time. You're beautiful. Perfect. My name is vassago. That's different. Different. - I'm regina. - I know. You know? I know. Yes, regina. Regina, you don't look like you belong here. - Yeah. - Well, maybe you're right. - No, not maybe. I am right. I'm so right, that i know where you do belong. - Let me take you somewhere. Make you feel... Make us both feel... Something. We're waiting for some people. Why don't you let regina make her own decisions? Why don't you piss off? Yeah. Bye. I'll see you again. What's the deal? You said he was cute. He's a creep. God, regina, get some sense. Let's get out of here. Let's go. No luck, huh? Not always. I'm zoe. You have very beautiful eyes. What? Nothing. I was just... Imagining the two of us together. I made it myself. I like this. I use bones in my work. Oh, you're an artist too? Yes, of sorts. I'm making a sculpture. Would you like to see it?

Goddamn it! You know what he wanted to do to you? Do you have any idea? You know what he wanted to do to you?

Are you okay? I'm fine. Regina? He's crazy! Leave me alone! I got it. Now wait a minute here. It's not me. He's doing it. Jesus christ, am i... Seeing... through... him? He was with regina. We're connected somehow. I know him. I know what he looks like. I should call the police. No. No, i should call the police. I should call the police right now and have them lock you up in a fucking loony bin. Or maybe i should call an exorcist. Tell me. No, listen. I know it sounds crazy... it is crazy. You need help, hatch. Didn't you hear what nyebern said? You might have a brain tumor. You won't see a psychiatrist, And now you've scared the living shit out of our daughter! - She's gotta know. - Tell me what i should do. Believe me. Damn it! I'll go see how regina is. I am vassago. Vassago. You know, i don't know her last name. Zoe something. Okay, so no missing person report. Thank you very much. Bye. Uh, listen, can you hang on one second? Where you going? I'll be back. When? Soon, soon. Hatch! - Hi. - Have i caught you at a bad time? No, no, no. I just didn't want hatch to know it was you. Listen, um, he won't come in for more tests. He's completely paranoid. Now he's convinced he's, uh, psychically connected to somebody. We've got to get him in. If it is an organic brain anomaly, then his condition... Could continue to deteriorate unless we do something now. Um... Dr. Nyebern, is it... Is it at all possible t-That he really is seeing things? Like this is all somehow real, what he's been saying? Is that what you think? I don't know. I mean, i don't know what to think anymore. Well, if it is psychological, then dr. Martin... Could help with this. Anything specific i could tell him about this... Connection he's imagining? Mmm, Here's something. It probably doesn't mean anything. Call me if there's anything else. Bye. Redlow. It's jonas nyebern. I know, i know. I think i may have a lead. Lousy fuck. ...bullets in those? There are no bullets in them, but you always assume that weapons are loaded. Now, we got to have a gun in the bedroom. Jesus christ. Here. I'm putting it right here under my t-Shirts. I don't believe this. The shotgun we'll hide in the downstairs closet. We're gonna get both you and regina lessons right away. I don't believe you bought these without talking to me about it. Jesus christ, hatch. I just feel we may need protection. I won't have guns in this house. We can get a lockbox... No! I won't! That's right. That's my name. Oh, no. Marion told me you might come. Please, come in. Give me your hand. Why have you lost your trust? I see a child's bicycle. How many monsters will it take? One, two, three, four... Let me try again. Let me try again. One, two, three, four, Five, six, seven, Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13... Some souls choose to only live for a short time, hatch. Hmm? Hold these. Think of two questions. Keep one to yourself and tell me the other one. Um... Okay. Okay. Why am i having these visions? You're tied to them by a coincidence of fate. You crossed over. You brought something back with you. What? Something very powerful. The one from your visions? He knows you watch him. He does? Yeah. Now for the second question. Someone close to you is in danger. Do you have another daughter? Regina. This is regina. But there is a purity within you... And you must surrender to it. Your weakness... Would bring about her death. Hmm. Okay. What's that supposed to mean? My weakness? Never! Never regina! Okay. You tell me to surrender, then you say my daughter might die. Bullshit! There's another energy around you. That's... that's irresponsible bullshit! He's here. Oh! No. No, no.

No. No! He killed somebody again. This time because of me. He sees through me. Oh. Oh, jesus. Shh! Come in. It's not locked. Uh, put that on the table. Sorry. You got a permit for that? Yeah. What can i do for you, detective? Well, uh, somebody phoned in a murder report. So, i, uh, checked it out. There was evidence of some foul play, but no body. So, i thought of you. Maybe he's taking the bodies with him? Ah, ah. Another, uh, gut feeling? Look, detective, i know you'll think this is crazy, But i know who's killing these girls. He's young, dark hair. He always wear sunglasses. His name is vassago. He's been staying at the blue skies motel. Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh. And, uh, where were you tonight? He's been here all night... with me. So maybe you are one of them "clairvoyers" that sees, You know, crimes and bodies and stuff. What do i know? Just don't leave town, okay, mr. Harrison? Because if rose orwetto doesn't turn up, Then i'm gonna have to come back here and ask you some questions. I'll let myself out. You be careful with that thing. Okay, how do you know these things? Because i've been sucked into this evil fuck. Why you? - I don't know, but i know who he wants next. Who? He's comin' after regina. No! Don't say that! It's not true! - Lindsey! Trust me! - Nobody's trying to kill regina! I'm the one who's got to stop this guy. Goddamn it, hatch. Do you see what you're doing? I'm trying to save our daughter. Our daughter samantha, not our daughter regina. Samantha, hatch. Remember sam? What? It's not your fault, baby. You didn't kill her, okay? Fate killed her. Honey, honey, honey. The goddamn car killed her. You didn't. Please. Listen... don't you get it? You're making this whole thing up so this time you can be the big hero... And save our daughter! Damn it! Just listen! Whether you believe or not, this is what's gonna happen! Tonight, i'm up and on guard. Regina's safe in the day, but by tomorrow night... You and she have to go someplace, and i can't know where it is, And you gotta stay there 'til this is over. Can you do that? Is that clear? Can you do that? - Yes, i can leave. Because i can't help you with this anymore. Lindsey. I love you. Afternoon, hatch. Marion. Be right back. Detective. Huh. The most interesting aspect of this case is his vision. Closer on his face. The muscles which cause the pupils to dilate have been destroyed. The slightest amount of light can cause extreme discomfort if not pain. You. We use specially designed contact lenses to filter light. That's you. With these in place, he's able to withstand low levels of tungsten. Do you have anything to add, doctor? Jeremy's violent behavior has caused us... Nyebern. To sedate him for more than six months. Since the procedure, his psychosis has increased. Doctor... now me. He has escaped into a delusional world. That son of a bitch! Hatch! What's wrong? Yes! Jonas? Nyebern! Hatch, what are you doing... who's jeremy? I was thinking about you. Would you like some tea? Nyebern! I got to find him. Who's jeremy? Where did you get that tape? You tell me. You're gonna tell me what's goin' on. Hatch? Oh. Sorry. May i help you? Yes. I was beginning to wonder if anyone was here. Are the harrisons in? No, they're not actually. Where can i find them? They're old friends of mine. I know all the harrisons' friends. How privileged they must feel. My wife and i are having a little garden party... And we've misplaced their number. So perhaps you could jot it down for me, so i can send them an invite. I'd leave it here, but it's so much more personal if they get it at home. I'll, um... I'll put it on the back of one of our business cards. Then... your wife can read it to you at home. Yes, my wife. Thank you. I'll see myself to the door. Actually, there is one more favor you could do for me. Would you have a bathroom? What are you hiding, nyebern? Patient information is confidential. Confidential? This is the kid i've been seeing in my head. He's slaughtering people. I cannot divulge patient information. You're protecting a homicidal maniac. All right! Jeremy was one of my patients! Thank you. Bitch! I was very nice to you, lady! I don't know why you weren't nice to me. All i wanted was information. What, do i have to call 411? Oh, jesus. All i'm concerned about right now is the protection of your family. You want to protect my family? This fucking jeremy is stalking my teenage daughter! Tell me who he is! All right, all right. Calm down. Jesus. Tell me, you bastard! Tell me who he is! Oh! Redlow. Jeremy is your son? Three years ago... He killed his mother. And he killed his sister. Then he killed himself. You brought him back? Like me. Even as a child, jeremy was psychotic. But... he was my son! You'd have done the same. - No. No. "Wonderland. Under the roller coaster." Regina, come on. Are you packed? Yeah, yeah. Hurry up. Okay. I don't really know why i'm bringing all this stuff. It's not like i'm ever gonna end up wearing it. Uh, call waiting sucks. I'm not getting that. Okay. Please have left already. I'll give you the number as soon as i know where we're gonna be. I mean, we're not supposed to tell anybody, 'cause, um... I don't know. It's just... No! ...packing. Just tell 'em... No! - Say something. - No, no, no, no. I don't know. Goddamn it! - Regina! Regina! Regina? Regina? No! Regina? - Regina! No! No! Hatch! Hatch! He's got regina! Oh! You drive. Where am i going? I don't know yet. Just keep going. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Lindsey, we'll get her back. Okay. Fuck! She's still alive. Jesus christ. What are you doing? They're on the east west highway, going east. Other way! Wonderland. What? He's taken her to that old amusement park. Jeremy. Oh... you. God, what is this? You killed jeremy. No. I brought you back. I brought you back to life! - I-I came here to help you. - "I came here to help you." - I want to help you. - "I want to help you." Here, here, here, here. Okay. Don't you get it, huh? I don't want to be saved. I don't want to be saved. I want to be damned. Through this maintenance door. I asked you here to show you my work. I've changed my mind. Oh, jesus. This way. What?
