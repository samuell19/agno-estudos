[eerie music] [sobs and whimpers] [guns fire] [faint screams] [rapid heartbeats] [explosion] [guns fire] [patient screams] [rapid breathing] [patient screams] [Dr. Death chuckles] [patient screams] [rapid heartbeat] [patient gasps] [eerie music] [birds chirp] [eerie music] [engine rumbles] [eerie music] [gurney rattles] - Flynn, pay attention. - April, welcome. You certainly picked quite a day to start work. One of our residents passed away last night. - I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? - Heart attack. Unfortunately, that means everything I had planned to ease you into your first day will have to get pushed. - I'm, I'm good at jumping in fee first. - Then I guess I hired the right person, follow me. [eerie music] [footsteps echo] I have to go deal with a few things regarding Mr. Cuda. I left your scrubs for you in your locker. Why don't you go get changed, and then you can help Ryan with Mr. Cuda's things upstairs. [whispers] Today of all days, Max. [birds squawk] - Lost, newbie? April, right? I'm Flynn, glad to have you on board. We've been understaffed for a while, so it's nice to have a fresh face. - I need to change. Where do I do that? - Down that way is the staff area. You'll find everything you need. - Okay. - Well, almost everything. - Thanks. [birds squawk] - Let me know if you need any help. [locker rattles] [eerie music] [footsteps echo] [knock on wall] - Hi, I'm April. Miss Valdez told me to come help you with, um, the guy who passed away's stuff. You're Ryan, right? - Max. - I'm so sorry, - Oh, - I swear she said your, - No, - Name was Ryan. - Yes, my name is Ryan. The man who died is, was, Max. This is him. [somber music] - Very distinguished looking. [both chuckle] - Yeah, he had quite a life. Definitely gonna miss those war stories. You know, you get so used to 'em being around, and then they're gone, just like that. I guess we're lucky you showed up, huh? [both chuckle] Kind of refills the void he left behind. But we have the unfortunate task of packing away his life. I tried to organize it as much as possible, but ultimately it's an exercise in futility. - How so? - Well, Max had no living relatives. - So then what happens to all his stuff? - It gets tossed or donated. - That's so sad. Family history is really important, you know? - Yeah. Well, you could get started on the closet over here. - Yeah. - That would help. - [chuckles] Okay. [door squeaks] - Oh, just so you know, Max held onto a lot of stuff. - Yeah, I can see that. [both chuckle] Good luck. - Oh, thank you. - It was April, right? - Yes. - Nice to meet you, April. - You too. - Okay. [playful music] [suspenseful music] [knock on door] - You find the old man's porn stash yet? [chest scrapes] What do you have there? This is exactly why I wanted to do this, and I have to be stuck on corpse duty with Weirdo Warren. Let's have a look. Looks like new girls getting greedy already. - Don't you have anything better to do, Flynn? I think Miss Beaumont needs help with her AC. - Better than digging for buried treasure? Yeah, right. Oh, it's like Christmas when these old farts die. Never know what you're gonna find. - It's locked, there's no key. [suspenseful music] What is his deal? - He's, uh, not exactly a charmer, if you know what I mean. - How does a guy like that get a job here? - You familiar with the term nepotism? - Oh, gotcha. [footsteps echo] [hammer taps] - You serious? - Hey. [chains rattle] - See, just like Christmas. [ominous music] What the hell is this? [chest creaks] Oh man, this is killer. [suspenseful music] - Well, April, it looks like you had an eventful morning, a real trial by fire for your first day. Obviously this was unexpected. Generally, I like to ease the new staff in, but these things, well, they happen. Says here, you're from California, looking for a fresh start. - Looking. - Fair enough, that's fine. Carmen, please send Jennifer to my office. Thank you. [phone clicks] Now typically the staff consist of five rotating caregivers, but right now it's just Jennifer, Ryan, Flynn, and now you. So I'm going to have all four of you here pretty much at the same time, while you acclimate to things and we readjust the schedule. - Sounds good to me. [eerie music] - Excellent. [knock on door] Jennifer, have you had a chance to meet April, she's the newest member of our Shady Oaks family. - Hi doll. - Jennifer will give you a tour of the place and introduce you to the residents. If you have any questions, our doors are always open. Welcome aboard. - Thank you. - Let's go. [birds chirp] So Ryan told me, you and Flynn really hit it off. - You could say that. [both laugh] - Yeah, He's a real piece of work, that one. Don't sweat it. He acts all alpha, but he's about as scary as a neutered puppy. [April laughs] [knocks on door] Hey, Syd! [playful music] He's a little hard of hearing. - Oh. - Hey, Syd. I wanted to introduce you to the new girl. This is April. She's starting today. He's a little hard of hearing. You have to talk up a little louder. - You said April. - Yes. - Hello. - What's your handicap? - April. - 'Round 18. [chuckles] Give or take the day. Damn shame about Max. - Are you going to the memorial service? It's after dinner. Okay, we'll see you there, Syd. - Bye. - Damn it. - Next up is Gladys. [knock on door] [suspenseful music] How's the new one coming, Gladys? - Just finishing some final touches. - Can I take a look? - Of course. - April's starting today. - Oh, I know. I made this for her. Not a bad likeness. I thought you'd be taller though. - Gladys claims she's psychic. - And Jennifer claims she's a caregiver. - We'll agree to disagree. All right, Gladys, later. - Nice to meet you. [eerie music] [footsteps echo] - How did she know what I looked like? - Beats me, maybe she really is psychic. Then again, none of her paintings have faces, so she probably just got lucky. Artists, am I right? Come on, doll, more to see. [playful music] - Oh so a little history on Rufus, the man has a case of frisky hands. Now I don't mind it so much. He's just a rich old man who's lonely. But if you show him even just a little bit of attention, he can be quite generous in showing his appreciation, if you know what I mean. But if that's not your thing, you're gonna wanna watch your ass, or you're gonna get pinched. - Oh. [knocks on door] - [Jennifer] Oh Rufus. - Oh, Jennifer, you're looking mighty fine today, mighty fine. - And who do we have here? - This is April. She's starting today. - Well, it appears our dearly departed Maximilian has sent us an angel to brighten this sad day. [all chuckle] [playful music] Rufus Coleman, very nice to meet you. - So nice to meet you, Mr. Coleman. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Please, Rufus. - All right, you old smoothie. I'm giving April the tour, not ringing the dinner bell. - Very well then. Don't let me interrupt. - Jennifer. Will I be seeing you later tonight? [door clicks] - Last but not least, Miss Belmont, just so you know, she recently had a stroke, so she can't speak. Also, she's a total klepto. If you're missing anything, it's probably in here. She doesn't mean anything by it. She just doesn't know where she is half the time. She wanders. [dramatic musical score] [Dorothy whimpers] What? - How'd this get here? - Is that thing yours? - Well, no, it was Mr. Cudo's, but Flynn took it. - Dorothy, you've gotta stop this. [Dorothy moans] You know how Flynn gets, when people take his stuff. Now I've gotta get this back to him before he realize it's missing. He gets really when people take his... - Stolen property? - Yeah. - It was really great to meet you. I'm April. [playful music] [suspenseful music] - Having served his country in World War II, and as a public defender, and family man in his later years, Max led an illustrious life. And even though we will miss him, we should feel blessed that we were able to spend quality time with him at the end of his long life's journey. - Thank you, Carmen. - And special thanks to Gladys for painting these beautiful paintings. Would anyone else like to say something about Max? Sydney? - Well, it's no secret that Max was shit at his golf game, but he was a pleasure to have a drink and a laugh with. [chuckles] [ominous music] He used to regale me with the craziest stories about the time he was in Germany during the war. I dunno if he drunk when he was telling me, or drunk or high when it happened, but he'd tell me about these little creatures. - I thought you brought the puppet back to Flynn. - What are you talking about? - Well, it has been a long day. I, I think at best, if everybody retires to their rooms, Thank you all for being a part of this celebration, and for sharing your stories, and for being a part of this wonderful experience where we pay our respects to our dear friend, Max. [ominous music] - [Ryan] So must have been cool living out in California, huh? - It was interesting. - What's interesting? - What is with you and that damned doll? It is so creepy. - One, something that's old and rare is always valuable. And two, it's a puppet, not a doll. - Whatever, it's creepy. - Don't you listen to that nasty woman. You're not creepy. You're a gold mine, yes, you are. - Anyway, I always dreamt of going out there, maybe meeting some rich, famous actor. - Yeah, emphasis on rich, right? - Shouldn't you be doing rounds? - Shouldn't you be doing Rufus? Show me where the bad man touched you. - [Ryan] Dude. [Jennifer sighs] - Or to save some time, show me where he hasn't touched you, right? - Can you seriously just fuck off? [Flynn thumps] [playful music] - Good job, Jenny. - [Ryan] Just go do your rounds, Flynn. - Take that stupid doll with you. - Okay, ha ha. Which one of you fucks took my- - Mr. Lambert? Our residents are waiting for you. Change your scrubs first. [Flynn sighs] [footsteps echo] [eerie music] [unseen creature chuckles] [rapid breathing and footsteps] [machine assisted breathing] [unseen creature pants] [door creaks] [door clicks] [ominous music] [door creaks] [rapid breathing and footsteps] [Dr. Death chuckles] - So why here of all places? Most people want to leave this city, not come to it. - Ain't that the truth. - I, I actually came here looking for someone. - This suddenly got a whole lot more interesting. A lost love? - A lost family member. [ominous music] - If you're looking to get lost, I can't think of a better place to do it than here. [machine hisses] [Dorothy gasps] [machine beeps] [Dorothy gasps] [beeping speeds up] [Dr. Death chuckles] - So, when you mean lost, where they running away or... - [Flynn] Everyone, come quick. [suspenseful music] - [Jennifer] What the hell did you do? - I didn't do shit. I found her like this. - Move! She's not breathing. Jenny, get the crash cart. - What happened? - Ryan, Ryan. Ryan, you need to stop. - What, why? - She has a DNR. We are required to stop. [floor creaks] [suspenseful music] - She must have torn it free. - [Jennifer] That's not supposed to be able to happen. - She probably did it when she went to go steal my puppet again. - What's wrong with you? She's dead. - Everyone calm down. I better call Warren to come and collect her. [footsteps echo] [suspenseful music] [crickets chirp] [zipper zips] [gurney rattles] [suspenseful music] [footsteps echo] - What was that? [pen scratches] [zipper zips] [footsteps echo] [suspenseful music] - What the... [Dr. Death grunts] [Warren screams] [Warren pants] [suspenseful music] [Dr. Death chuckles] [screams] What the fuck? [Warren screams] [Dr. Death chuckles] [bone saw whirs] [blood splatters] [Warren screams] [ominous music] [birds chirp] [engine rumbles] [door clicks] - Hello? - It seems like... - Yes, how can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Dorothy Beaumont's granddaughter. I have this dress for her. - Yes, of course. I'm so sorry for your loss. [phone rings] Actually, could you do me a huge favor and just take it down to Mr. Abbott? - Uh, I don't. - It's just right down there, Sweetie. Luther, could you show her? Mr. Abbott should be there, but, but if not, just put it in the closet. [phone rings] I am so, so sorry for your loss. [phone rings] - Just, just around the corner. It's gonna be the first door on your left. I'd show you, but it's a busy day and death waits on no one. [suspenseful music] - Hello? Mr. Abbott? [suspenseful music] [unknown item thumps] [suspenseful music] [door creaks] [dramatic musical score] [granddaughter screams] [ominous music] [thunder cracks] - How's Syd doin'? - He's calm now. Took three stiff bourbons. - Did you hear about what happened to Mr. Abbott? - No, what about him? - He's dead. - Oh my God, seriously? - They found him in the funeral home. He was like mutilated or something. Like, who would wanna do that to Mr. Abbott? I mean, sure, he was a little weird. But all these deaths, it's like there's some bad mojo in the air or something. - I guess so. - Speaking of mojo, Gladys is feeling a little jittery. So I was gonna bring her some warm milk to help her sleep. I don't suppose you can go check in on Rufus? I'm sure he'll be on his best behavior for you. - Yeah. Yeah, I can go check on him. - You're a doll, doll. [thunder rumbles] [suspenseful music] - Poor Miss Beaumont. I mean, it's just so tragic. Makes one realize how moments you have left to seize. - I unfortunately didn't get the chance to really know her. [thunder rumbles] - What was that? - What? - Out there. - I'll go check it out. [suspenseful music] - Me too. [chuckles] [suspenseful music] [thunder crashes] [April screams] [dramatic musical score] - [Director] We lost one of our residents today. - The man who died was Max. [Max screams] - Used to talk about all these little creatures. - [Ryan] We have the unfortunate task of packing away his life. - What the hell is this thing? - Dorothy, what? What's wrong? - I thought you brought the puppet back to Flynn. - What are you talking about? - She must have torn it free. - [Flynn] She probably did it when she went to go steal my puppet again. - Did you hear about what happened to Mr. Abbott? He's dead. [Warren screams] [granddaughter screams] [thunder crashes] - It's okay, you're safe. - What happened? Where is she? - Rufus said you fainted. - Do you remember anything of what happened? You can tell us. - You're not going to believe me. - Why wouldn't we believe you? - Because it's crazy. It was Miss Beaumont. - What do you mean it was Miss Beaumont? - I saw her outside the window. - Well, clearly that's not possible. Miss Beaumont is dead. - I know what I saw. - April, I'm not doubting that you saw something, but Miss Beaumont... - Clearly she's not crazy. Let's just think about this for a second. - The storm was pretty intense last night. The thunder and the lightning. Maybe you just thought you saw Miss Beaumont, right? - Yeah. - What about Miss Beaumont? - April swears she saw Miss Beaumont outside of Rufus's window last night. What? - I just got off the phone with the police. - Ms. Beaumont's body is missing from morgue. [dramatic musical score] [Syd coughs] [suspenseful music] [indistinct voices on TV] [paintbrush scratches] [paintbrush clatters] [pats legs] [engine rumbles] [door clicks] - So April. April, come on in. Hop in the Chevy. Go grab a drink. [suspenseful music] [footsteps echo] [door creaks] [dramatic musical score] - Holy shit! Miss Beaumont? What the fuck? [dramatic music] [boxes clatter] Seriously, what the fuck? [boxes scatter] No, no, no, no. I, I saw your body. I carried you out. What the hell? [suspenseful music] Stop stealing my stuff, you crazy dead bitch! [neck creaks] What the fuck! [rapid footsteps] [suspenseful music] [tool thumps] [Flynn groans] [blood splatters] [repeated thwacks] [suspenseful music] - Been pretty quiet today, huh? - Yeah, so far. All the residents seem pretty uneasy though. - They're not the only ones. - What's up? - Look, I know I'm new here, and you know everyone way better than I do, but I can't shake the feeling that Flynn might have something to do with Miss Beaumont's death. - Flynn? I mean, Flynn is a lot of things, but he's not a murderer. - Her oxygen tube, it looked like it was yanked out. - Yeah, probably by Miss Beaumont. - She was in her bed when we found her. - Well... No, no way. Flynn wouldn't do that. Why would he? - That doll. You heard him, he's convinced it's valuable. - That stupid skull thing? - People do crazy stuff when money's involved, especially large sums of money if that thing is as valuable as he says. Ryan, weird things have been happening ever since Flynn laid eyes on it. First, Miss Beaumont and, and then Warren. - All right, what do you want me to do? [suspenseful music] [lock rattles] If we do this he's gonna know. - Well, if the doll's inside, then wouldn't that at least make him a person of interest? - Uh, puppet, and I still say it's a stretch. [sighs] And if it's not inside? - Then he's probably not the killer, and I buy him a new lock. - Ah, the things I do for pretty women. [lock snaps] Ladies first. - Not only handsome, but a gentleman too. [whispers] Okay. - [Ryan] Whoa. - [April] Okay. - He's definitely gonna kill us. Nothing here but his spare keys. [playful music] [ominous music] - [On TV] Jesus, what was that thing? - [indistinct] come to reclaim his heritage. - [On TV] I want the police to look into him too. [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbles] - [Rufus] Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? - [Jennifer] Well, I came to check in on my favorite resident. - Truth is I'm a little freaked out. - Well, that's why I'm here. These'll calm your nerves in no time. - Well, I was really hoping you would offer me something more to alleviate my anxiety. - I'll see what I've got in my cart for that. [thunder rumbles] You think I'm just gonna give this away? - I would never think of such a thing. Am I getting closer? - A little closer. [thunder rumbles] - I can't think of a better way to spend my children's inheritance. - Do you really think you're ready for this, big man? - The spirit's willing, but I'm not the man I used to be. I, I could use a little assistance. - Don't you worry one little bit, Rufus. I got just what we need. Now, it's gonna take a little bit to kick in. [pills rattle] So I'll be back in about a half an hour. Remember, it's our little secret. [door clicks] [thunder crashes] God! - You didn't by any chance see Flynn's puppet in Mr. Coleman's room, did you? - You mean that creepy doll thing? No. - [Ryan] Well, have you seen it at all today? - Why don't you ask Flynn? I saw his car here when I was checking in on Gladys. He's here somewhere. - [April] Let's go. [thunder crashes] - Things are getting really weird around here. [mug rattles] [footsteps echo] - Everything copacetic? - As well as can be expected. Jennifer just did the rounds, and it seems like everyone's at least settled in for the evening. - Good. Well, I'm heading back to my office to finalize some paperwork. Here's hoping things stay quiet around here for the rest of this evening. [thunder rumbles] [glass shatters] [ominous music] - Who's down there? [thunder rumbles] [ominous music] [thunder rumbles] [footsteps echo] [dramatic musical score] Who is that? [ominous music] [curtains rattle] [dramatic musical score] [thunder rumbles] [ominous music] [Carmen yelps] [Carmen screams] [Dr. Death chuckles] [door slams] - You see anything? - [April] Nothing, it's absolutely spotless. Somehow. - Oh, great. Clearly the sign of a deranged serial killer. - [April] You could help, you know, probably go a lot faster. - I thought I was supposed to keep lookout for Flynn. - [April] Multitask. - Wait, are you seriously trying to get us caught? [keys rattle] - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Flynn! Flynn, hey, who did this to you? - The fucking puppet. [thunder rumbles] - Hello again, Mr. Coleman. [door clicks] I believe you ordered something extra special tonight. Oh, it's peek a boo game tonight. Peek a boo! [thunder rumbles] Rufus, again? Well, here's hoping you have pleasant dreams. Jesus Christ. Looks like not all of you's asleep. You don't mind if I take a little peek, right, doll? I mean, I might as well get your money's worth. Oh my God, Rufus? [Dr. Death growls] [Jennifer screams] [dramatic music] [dramatic musical score] [thunder crashes] [Jennifer gasps] [thunder rumbles] [suspenseful music] [thunder crashes] [door creaks] [suspenseful music] [indistinct speech on TV] [golf club thwacks] - Dr. Lantmen? - Carmen? [rapid knocking] - Help me, I'm in here! [indistinct] - It's stuck. Hang on, hang on! - Mrs. Beaumont's body is down there. - Flynn's dead too. He was stuffed inside the trunk of his car. - Where's Dr. Lantmen? - In his office. [door clicks] I'll go to Dr. Lantmen and call the cops. You two, find Jennifer and check on the residents. - You check on Rufus, I'll check on Gladys and Syd. - Dr. Lantmen! [ominous music] Oh my God. Dr. Lantmen? [Carmen gasps] [thunder rumbles] [Carmen struggles and screams] [ominous music] - Rufus? [dramatic musical score] [whispers] Holy shit. [knock on door] - [April] Syd, Syd I'm coming in. [dramatic music] Oh my... [thunder rumbles] [April screams] They're all dead. - We have to get out of here. [suspenseful music] [footsteps echo] [thunder rumbles] Oh my God. - Dr. Lantmen? - Go! [dramatic music] Ryan! [dramatic music] [machine beeps] [charge builds] [dramatic music] Clear! [electricity crackles] [thunder rumbles] You okay? Ryan. - I'm good. - Is he dead? Be careful. [heart beats] [scalpel stabs] Ryan? [Ryan groans] Ryan! [dramatic musical score] [squelch] [Dr. Death chuckles] [ominous music] [footsteps echo] No! [Dr. Death chuckles] Stop. Don't. [Dr. Death chuckles] No, I said stop! [suspenseful music] I've been searching for you for a long time. [thunder rumbles] I'm your great, great granddaughter. I'm April Duval. [thunder rumbles] [suspenseful music] We're family. [thunder rumbles] - It says here you are from California. Looking for a fresh start. - Looking. - Let's have a look. Looks like new girls getting greedy already. - How'd this get here? - So why here, of all places? Most people want to leave this city not come to it. - I actually came here looking for someone. - A lost love? - A lost family member. Family history is really important. I came here for you. I wanna help you. [Dr. Death chuckles] I'm gonna help you find your friends. [ominous music] [thunder rumbles] [playful music]
