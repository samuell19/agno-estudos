SORCERESS We've got them! Move on! Let's go friend. Get up. The Shatrias. Traigon found us! Krona's house is nearby. Flee and we'll stop! Come my lady, over here. Carefully! Do not hurt the child. Leave me! Traigon, butcher! The gods avenge us. My beloved, even the gods obey me. Bring me the baby. The father must see his firstborn. Beautiful! Kalghara be pleased! Traigon No, do not kill my baby. I promised my firstborn to Kalghara. You know that sacrifice is necessary for our reign. For Honor, they're two! So what is the first? That's right, you need to know, right? - Because if you equivocas... - Do not play with me! I do not have time for that. Which? Which?! Hudra, The claw! Tell me my beloved. Or you'll never have another. The gods will avenge us! Crown, Crown! And she stops talking. Beast! Criminal! Crown, Crown! Krona, this does not concern you. Fools! It is disarmed. Mátenlo! Well my old friend. Age does not affect your ability. I do not in my arts trained to murder women. Never you understood the great values. Traigon tell me, which of your three lives take now? Is it just the first or finally the last? You are overconfident, my old friend. It's just an illusion. You look insecure. You're weakening. No! It was only the first, Krona. When the moon is in the House of the Dragon, I will return, and you're here to... for my desire. Take my babies. Traigon return. He will return for his firstborn. I will do it. They will become great warriors. And they will take revenge. They are girls. Girls. Jokes with the gods to mortals. It does not matter. Guerreras be. I said. From now on, the two shall become one. Krona share powers. I grant them the secrets of wizardry and expertise in battle. Great Krona. What brings you on a night like this? I ask a favor, Dargon. Whatever, teacher. We owe life. Since that night when we lost the kingdom. Take care of these girls as if they were his daughters. Of course, I have one, but I can have three. Well. But Dargon, one day men will come, and seek the two girls, barbaric lineage. But they look at girls. No one should know that they are women. The hide, Krona. It will be as you want. Shatrias, my faithful servants. For 20 years we have waited for this moment. The moon is in the House of the Dragon. And the teacher will be with us once again. Start. I love, his faithful servants greet him. Master. His warriors await your orders. Whoever serves me well one day govern a nation. He will command an army as has ever been seen. All this will be fulfilled when invoke Kalghara. And now, my first order. Most importantly, finding the two are as one. What creature is this? I do not know, but it seems friendly. Hey, you want to swim with us? What's that you have? Hanging between her legs. I do not know. A kind of horn? A weapon? But how I would use. I do not know and I will not stay to find out. Are you sure you want to hurt us? Dad said not to trust strangers. Maybe they tell their friends and come back. We'd better hurry. - Soldiers! - Shatrias! A sword, Captain! Rebel, you have an illegal weapon. I'm not a rebel. I am a simple pastor. A man has the right to defend his home. ¿Defend it from whom? Of us? Of the law? You are not the law. They are bandits!, criminals! The punishment for the rebels It's death! Alto! There is something more important than I look. You can save your life miserable, rebellious. If you bring me the two are as one. I do not know what you mean, Shatria. No, the maids are here. Your you were the hiding! Bring them now! I know nothing of maidens, except for my only daughter. You should know if your own man being violated. My baby! Need to look at two are as one. Attack these men, let him die slow! Let's anyone who hides! Mátenlos! Compas Stop right there! I salute them. That ability to fight is worthy of the gods. I Baldar of Domarn. In my 56 battles, I have never seen such skill. They must have learned from the master. There is nothing to do, compas. They travel to heaven. Were your family? They were our father, mother and sister. I'm sorry, compas. But that Shatria are looking for two as one. I think he found them, is not it? Yes, we are as one. Do we bury or deliver them to the fire? The fire. It is our custom. Mira, Mara. Where did you come from? Who you are? It was I who gave them their battle skills. Was you? Yes, this... Give me your hand. So, my powers will pass to you. By Yggdrasil! This is witchcraft! - So you're... - Krona. Our father told us about you. He said he would come back someday. Yes, but I came back very late. Now all it leads to revenge. I do not understand, great Krona. Which caused all this, Traigon the sorcerer. He also killed his real mother. It was to avenge that, and more, I gave them my powers. We will master, we will seek to Traigon. And kill him. They will face great danger. We are not afraid. The powers of illusion. Delusion? Normal weapons do not affect him. They need the name. The secret name of the Almighty. It's Ok. Teacher? When all seems lost, use the name! Name? Vitahl. Remember, Vitahl. - Vitahl. - Vitahl. Wait! I'm leaving, to my destination. I will join my friends who lost their lives for giving me his word. My compas, leave the cries and avenge these people. They should find and kill Traigon. I extend my hand, join forces and let us help. Let's get together then. Fact! My Ragnarök. He's a thief. He stole the vicar. They cut their hands. He is a thief who stole candy vicar's son. They say it is the law of Traigon. - Traigon! - Traigon! What will happen now? It beggars again. And probably better bearing. Baldar how to find your friend think so many people? Where to look. In every city there is a place where it is forever. The Barbarian won again! The bet is mine. Snakes. Two snakes. Impossible! He could not win again. He won three times in a row! The barbarian is doing something. Well, barbarian, you bring forth snakes again? I will do it. Snakes. It is impossible for the goddess of fortune will smile both barbarian. Witchcraft! Black magic! Black magic. Handsome man like you, I grant you good fortune. You'll earn more. I won enough already. Thank you. Why do you give to this barbaric dog? You're a dog, And a son of a bitch! Do not you barbarian ears? Do dogs do not speak? We have heard, and we talked. Wow, wow! Mocks you, Hathor. Wow! I have to go. I had a good time. No, leave, those are for men. No dog. I'm sorry, do you fall? Come on you can do it! He was commissioned. I knew it. Would you excuse me? Enjoy it. Baldar, are you here? Give thanks to Modin. Bobo boy. Soldiers! They are Shatrias! Erlick, friends, soldiers must not see them. - Friends? - Yes. - Here. - Compas, hurry. Faster Faster! Pando, follow me. You, what happened here? Barbarians were four. And there were two that were as one. Two were like one? I can not tell them apart. - I'm Mara. - And Mira. My name Erlick, can be washed here. Rest if you want. How did you find me, Baldar? I have a good nose, boy. No matter, will not return to the kingdom of my father. I do not like war or fighting. I want to be adventurous. Live Free. Strange taste wines and exotic lips of women. The perfect disguise. But are girls! - Girls? - What are you talking about? I say they are not men. We are not? Are we not men? Are you sure? You see?, Look I told you that something was not right. But it's what Dad told us. What is the difference? No... do not you know? Know what? The difference. You do not know what makes us different? Like those! How are you? Yes, but we never found important. Go to bathe. We will leave this for later. Compas, girls are in for a big surprise. They are under my protection, company. It seemed to me they can protect themselves. Two of them took an oath of vengeance. Revenge? Against whom? - A man named Traigon. - Traigon? Do you know him? Where is? Forget it, Traigon is a sorcerer. They say it has magical powers. They are good, but not both. I swore help. I do not look, I want a peaceful life. Mara, Mira, will be safe here until we return. Traben the door and not open to anyone. Mara, what do you think he meant by "surprise"? I do not know. But that Erlick has something. It gives me a funny feeling the way he looks at me. Abran, I'm a friend, Erlick sent me. Who you are? They must come. Erlick was caught by Traigon. ¿Traigon?! - ¿Traigon?! We will. Take us with Traigon. Follow me soon. Sean damsels or devils, and have. A piece of gold for each of you. And the fury of Traigon for whom miss. ¿Pawned your sword? The son of King Branwing! To play craps?! But I won, Baldar. I won! Make the most brightness, please. It was time! Hugo, púlela. Look at this, I got it in Babylon. But this is iron! It is too brittle to be sharpened. It is a new method, put on coals, the hammer again and again, and while still hot immerse in cold water. I'll show you, give me that. With a metal case, a man worth 10 enemies. Until his enemies also have it. You always have to object to new ideas. Watch this. What this stupid beast say? The maids are in trouble. I swore help, are you with me boy? Hey, that's enough. Give me my sword. We are ready for the test, Princess Delissia. So these are the two that are like? They possess the magic of an unknown god. Check this on the fire, for testing. Now, for the last time, What is the eldest? As we told you we do not know. Then the god Agni will reveal. Fire recognizes the firstborn. Agni has revealed the truth. The twins have returned. Barbarians fools! They go to hell for this! Horses! Horses! Hunnu. The high barbarian, find out who he is. And where it comes from. Baldar, wait. That's the Forbidden Forest. Nobody gets out alive from there. All right. So the Shatrias will be afraid to follow us. Yes, but we do not count on it. The Forbidden Forest had to go. The planets aligned again in months. They will not survive for so long. We must find them, now! If I can bring anyone you want, what would be my reward? I've already promised to rule the world to me. What more could you want? Empires were promised long ago. But a woman has... other desos too. I can not. I break my vows. You always say that. But you try to break your vows with that one. And that is also a crime against the gods. It is not a crime. It is a sacrifice for the greater good. Hunnu, would you like a reward? I thought so. And if you succeed, you will have the second of the two being as one. For your own pleasure. You want to explain yourself? No, tell you. You are wiser than me. What are you talking about? Well, Mara, Mira. Do you know where babies come from? We went to our father donated by the master Krona. You know how babies are born kids? Of course! But are animals. What was that? Oh no! What's that sweet smell? It comes from fruits. It makes me feel cheerful. - Here are the barbarians, master. - Finally. Oh, Mara. You look beautiful, even in those clothes pastor. Who are you? I am Traigon. You, Traigon, you killed my mother! Is what these barbarians told you? Did you deny? Listen, my daughter. I am your father. My father? Then why? When you explain everything, you understand. But now you must know that you are at home. Where you belong, after so many years. And they will treat you like the princess you are. Take her to her room. Wait! If you tell the truth, then I must ask you something. This man must be treated with respect because he's my friend. If it has helped you, my daughter, we will treat it as it deserves. Ishmar te protegerá, Erlickas. I know it will. - Traigon, high barbarian... - What? About the barbarian master. We have found this. What is that? Dices? Yes my master, they are loaded. Observe. I see. Good work, Khrakannon. Barbaro, the penalty for cheating in the game is... death by impalement. Death is only death, pig! Enough!, Take him. You get angry very easily, Khrakannon. I want to stab myself stake. Wait a second, we can discuss it. Hey Traigon! I do not enjoy this, young man. But I must give an example. Traigon Hey, I'm sorry if I said something offensive earlier. I talk man to man. Let me die standing! As a warrior. Why, dog? Death is only death. I'm sorry, I abhor! And I understood my mistake, you do not have to stick me! Tall! Wait. What do you have there? A medallion Armag Dynasty. ¿ARMAG? Let me see it. Barbaro, where did you get this? My mother gave it to me. When I was a kid. It is the ancestral blood Armag. If that is true, the sacrifice will be perfect. Yes, the maid will have on your body seed ancestral noble blood. Yes, Armag, I'm!, the dynasty of my father. Now you mind getting on before slipping me? And! Libéralo Khrakannon. Leave the stake in place. For after slaughter. We can never cross. No need, we can take that path. I see a villa. A type of house, or temple. You see it? How do you see it? So we are Mara and I see and feel the same as the other. And what do you see now? A temple on a hill. It's this way. It is soma, nectar of the gods. Do you see the moonbeam here? Tomorrow night will mark here. That will be the time. A new era will begin on Earth. And you will be his first avatar. A goddess, you will be honored for generations. Father, with all this talk, I feel dizzy. You'll understand then. But for now, trust me, my daughter. Trust me. Trust me. Everything will be fine. I do. You know what is best for me. And for all. Yes. To all my children. Now, go to your rooms. Your friend will visit you soon. He's fine, as you requested. Erlick. Thanks, Dad! You see Kalghara? As I promised long ago, You have the firstborn of Traigon. Like the soma? It's fabulous. What's wrong with it? The soma is the nectar of the gods. A secret that we inherited from ancient times. From the golden era. Of course, the golden age that Traigon says he wants to bring back. With him in charge, of course. I get bored Traigon and magic. I do not want to rule the world, not with him. I understand he continues. I want a real man next to me. Someone who can take away your power to Traigon, and remove it. But first, the sacrifice should continue as planned. You must make love to Mara, then you must sacrifice. She awaits you. Now, she goes with her, Erlick. After that, the world will be ours. Our destiny is to rule together. Like I said, Traigon, he is like wet clay in my hands. The typical simple-minded barbarian. Do not be so modest. You were very convincing. Even I could believe it. The important thing is to do what we want. And. I hope so. Erlickas! I thought they could have treated you badly. There was a little tense dispute, but now, for some reason, You really are you? Suddenly you became a woman. Why do you look like? You really do not know? I have this feeling in my gut when I touch you. I feel there is a wonderful secret behind it and you have the key. What's up girl? A snake? - What did you see? - I do not know... I feel strange. Where does it hurt? It does not hurt me, it's... I am very hot... It's... it's Mara. ¿Mara? They do being tortured? I do not know it... Do not! They not are tortured. By the horns... forget it. Obviously he's in good hands, but who? It must be Erlick. Yes, that's Erlick. That lustful boy. No... not again! I am now sure is Erlick. Detente! Get away from her. It is under my protection. Let me know when you find the cold river. - Friendabond! - What is that? Friendabond, they told me stories of this land since childhood. They say that once was the center of the world. Long ago, judging by how it looks now. Mara is there. There are many soldiers there. We must go as the night cover us. Ishmara show us the way. Now what you see, Mara? I see... a valley. A ville... and a temple. She is coming. They are coming? Your friend is a fool, after all. No fool. Brave. He does not understand the sacrifice. It will try to interfere. Unless you talk to him. Then we can be helpful. And she. Hunnu, my servant, in the end you will have your reward. So it was a trap. Let the dogs come to try my sword! Let's go! Who will be the first to die? I am waiting for you! Santo Gungnir! They are bewitched. Mara, look at me! Surrender, barbarian! I have news. Never! Traigon, Yea these are the cowards who will help. To rule the world! Fight me like men. No, barbarian. I have my army of warriors quality far superior. You will know very soon! How easy it is to get rid of fools. Prepare the sacrifice! Soon planets align. You've promised the other maid, master! He's angry! Filthy beast. I have no time for your filthy desires. Yet we did not lose, my brave friend. Still alive. What place is this, Baldar? Catacombs, the place of ancient warriors. This damn arrow! Look, you can remove it? The head is serrated. We find a way to get out of here. Yes, somehow. Sacrificial virgins bring. The smell of death! Wait here while I investigate the way. Kalghara, what I have promised you. My eldest daughter! Devoted with seed having ancestral blood. Give me the great power! - What are they? - Sorcery, illusion. They can not be real. They are very real, Baldar. Now, my beloved. Quick. When all seems lost, use the name, Vitahl. Vitahl. Vitahl! - Vitahl! Vitahl. Vitahl! What do you do? Fuck that shit, now! - You'll ruin everything. - Stop them. I'll give you another almighty! One princess! Take her to it! Now, Kalghara. Rise up my warriors! Stand up! - Erlickas. - Mara. Look. Get up, get up! They have long been buried, you know? Watch out! Pando! A horse Khrakannon, presto! If I love. Khrakannon, you know what your mother told when you were born? Wow, wow! Khrakannon not be so... wrathful. Now let's see what you got, sorcerer. With a snake? The power of illusion. My daughters. Well, company, how you reached a non? Baldar, forget that these two are as one
