♪ Thanking you ♪ For all that you've shown me ♪ Thanking you ♪ For all that you do ♪ Thanking you ♪ You'd never desert me ♪ And that's why I have so ♪ Much love for you - I was reading in a collection of quotes about children, and I came across a quote by Alexander Dumas, "Rarely in a little boy "do you see the potential of the man to become, "but always in a little girl "do you see the threat of the woman." I think I remember that quote so well because I have a little girl. Her name is Eury. When Eury was born, a tremendous shift occurred very deep down inside of me, and the moment Eury was born, a mother bear was born. I'm gentle, I have a lot of joy in my life, but if somebody tried to harm my little girl, murder wouldn't take more than a second for me to do. My daughter is my life. I work very hard at being the best mother I can be, and the more of a mother I am to her, the more I realize that I cannot be a father to her. The better the mother, the less able to be a father. My friends around here call me Faith, or Fay. ♪ And I thank you now ♪ Thank you with all of my heart ♪ For you've been there ♪ Right from the start ♪ And I'm thanking you now ♪ With all of my ♪ Heart - [Fay] Karen? - Yeah? - [Fay] Is it okay if I come in and get something from my trunk? - Oh sure, come on in. - Okay, thanks. That's really neat. - Thanks. - Ly... Lycanthrop. Lycanthrope. - I think it's lycanthropy. - Lycanthropy. - Yeah. - Lycanthropy. What does it mean? - [Karen] It means the medical ability to assume the form and characteristics of a wolf. - Bring it over. It just clicks right into place. - It's already flat, I just bring it down, then I'm gonna wanna ... - Yep. It's already flooded. Then you're not gonna want all that ink. You're gonna want just a tad. - Yeah, okay. - Use both hands and do it harder. Pull, just pull right back across it. - Okay. - Yep, can't hurt it. - Now I wanna flat it out. - Yeah, after you lift it off this shirt you wanna, okay, bring all that ink out. - That one's Aunt Betsy when she's stretching. Look at how far she can kick her leg up. Betsy's always liked to dance, huh? She's gonna shoot me with a rubber band because I was taking a picture of her. She'd missed, so she's gonna try again. And here's mama being pretty silly. I think we'll cover that picture up. See here, it must've been the same day. Now I think I'm gonna get her back. I don't know who was taking the picture. She's outside on the lawn. She's dancing. This is a shark face. We play shark faces. You know that. That came from Betsy when we were little girls. And here's mama when mama was about 15. Do you think I look the same? Do I look the same? - [Eury] I had the dream again. - You what, honey? - [Eury] I had the dream again. - What dream? - [Eury] With the little Indian girl. - You did, you had that dream again? Did you dream that last night? - Now way out into space we're shining our golden light down onto the earth. See your light now, and love shining on the mineral kingdom, helping the minerals, and the plant kingdom, now onto the animal kingdom. See people in all the countries, feeling your golden light, feeling the help you're sending them. - Bob, you don't mind me calling you Bob, do you? - [Bob] No, it's fine. - Okay, Bob. I've got a line on a Greyhound bus ticket for Fay to Seattle. We followed her there. It didn't seem like much. From there I made a widening circle and came across the Puget Sound, found her right here in a little town called Port Townsend. I didn't make any contact with her. As you can see, she's just a hop, skip, and a jump from Canada. From there, I can't go any further, so we don't wanna spook her. But I got her address, telephone number, the whole works right here. And if you want, I know a couple of fellows who can help you pick up the girl. - Freeze! Freeze! [laughs] Melt! [Eury screams] - [Eury] Mom! Mom! - [Fay] Eury! - [Eury] Mom! Mom! Mom! - Lady, I'm sorry, I guess it scared the hell out of here. I'm sorry. - [Fay] That's all right, that's all right. She probably surprised you too. Are you okay, honey? Let me see. Are you all right, doll? Okay, were you frightened? See, he's really nice. - See, this is bee stuff. - Are you all right, honey? - [Man] I'm sorry. This scares people sometimes. You ever seen one of these? You know what's in there? An arm. That's what's left of it. Know what happened? - [Eury] What? - It got cut off. You ever seen anything like that? It's kind of funny-looking, isn't it? You know how that got cut off? I got shot with a gun. You ever see people get shot with a gun in a movie or on TV or anything? Well, sometimes it turns out to be real bad, like this time. If they can't fix it, they just cut it off. You know what? It doesn't grow back. Never grows back. So you get something like this, and it's called a stump. I put this old sock and this thing on here, it's kind of like a shoe for my hand, but it's a shoe for my stump, and that keeps it from getting all beat up and stung. See, this is just a veil. It keeps the bees off me. See, there's a human under here. I'm a human, just like you. If I scared you, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry, but next time you see me, you'll know it's just a person under here, and you won't be afraid of me, okay? You have a nice day, honey. - Mom. He was a beekeeper and he turned out to be really nice, but he really scared Eury. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Well, partly, yeah. He lost one arm in Vietnam, so he has one. He's waving one arm at her. I can understand how she was scared, but the point ... Mom, we're 20 miles away from Canada. There are no killer bees up here. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Every minute, every minute, mom. You know she's with me every minute. I think she's fine. I think she's happy. She talks about the old place, but she understands that I'm here with her, and as long as I'm here, she's okay. Mom, I'm trying. I'm here 90% of the time. Uh-huh [affirmative]. Well, I know. Ma! Okay. Okay. Anyway, I just called to tell you Betsy's planning on coming up for a visit, and I think her boyfriend's coming up, and I can't get a hold of either one of them, but I wanted you to know that I'd love you to come visit us. The Silvers are coming back into the house in four or five weeks or so, and we'll be back in the cottage. We're so much happier here. There's so much room in the house. I'd love you to come visit. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. I know. I locked the door. Mom, we've covered our tracks. I just have faith that I'm doing everything I can do, and if she's with me, we're gonna be fine. I love you. Uh-huh [affirmative]. Do you have to go? Okay. I love you too, mom. Bye. You know who I am, right? - Yeah. - It's a costume. - Yeah. - This is a tricky game in life, and it's a game mama plays too, and everybody you know plays. The game is to try to understand when we're really in trouble and when we're not. Sometimes people who look scary will turn out to be our best friends and give their life to help us, and sometimes people who look real friendly and who are real nice can really have things in their mind or in their hearts that might hurt us. I think the best thing for us to do is to trust ourselves. When we grow up, we learn to listen to ourselves and talk to ourselves so that we believe in our first reaction. We listen. Okay? It's not just what we see. It's really what we feel deep inside. Do we feel threatened? Do we feel frightened? If we don't, then we can stay on our ground and know that we'll be okay. We'll have faith. [tranquil music] [knocking at the door] Good morning. Eury! Eury! Is that good? - What are the miss, are those kids? - What kids? They're missing, honey. They're not where they're supposed to be. Here, why don't you eat your cereal, okay? You have to go to school this morning. - But how'd they get to be missing? - Honey, I don't know how they got to be missing. Sometimes things just aren't where they're supposed to be. - Could I get to be missing? - Honey, I think maybe those children... You're not gonna get to be missing, because mama's always watching you. There's always somebody watching you. Someone always knows where you are. Do you feel good? Do you feel safe with mama? Okay, you won't get to be missing. That red reminds me of men. I think I must see red when I... [laughs] - [Debra] [laughs] You see red when you think about men. - [Fay] Think about men. [Fay and Debra laugh] - [Debra] What bugs you the most about men? - I don't know, I suppose it's that I love them. [laughs] Pisses me off. - What they say about us, you can't live with them, you can't live without them, that could be true. - What do I hate about men? Besides this feeling that you do love men, it's hard to not like them for long, but the part that gets to me consistently every single time about men is a feeling that I knew you'd be okay, I knew you could handle it. I knew you could be responsible. They're gonna look out for the children. Okay, now we're gonna have a lot of fun. Weekend Santa Claus and that kind of stuff. We're gonna have a lot of fun. The grumpy-- - Does your daughter see her dad much? Is it like that? Does she see him on the weekends? [phone rings] - Hello? Hi, Curtis. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Well the sun's down here. Uh-huh [affirmative]. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Well, three bedrooms. Yeah. I don't know when she's coming. You haven't talked to her? Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Well if you wanna come Tuesday, that's fine with me. Tuesday's fine. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. I'm sorry, Curtis, will you tell me again? [laughs] Uh-huh [affirmative]. Tuesday, 3:00. You know what? I'm gonna leave the door unlocked. I'm just, [laughs] sorry. I'm sorry, Curtis, I've just got a lot on my mind. No, it'll be wonderful, it'll be wonderful for me. I just have a lot on my mind. No, I look forward to meeting you. [laughs] Take it personally. Well she hasn't told me much. About Betsy? Well, I think I'll have to ask Betsy. I think I probably shouldn't talk for her. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Look at this pretty one. You remember when we put those dried-out seeds deep down into the earth and out come plants? - Yeah. - They're getting bigger every day, and they're gonna make flowers as pretty as this flower someday. We have a lot of things to do today. We're gonna have a lot of fun today. Do you like those flowers? - Yeah. Daddy's coming. - What?! What? - Daddy's coming. - What do you mean daddy's coming? Look at me. Look at me. - The little Indian girl. - What do you mean the little Indian girl? - She said she would shoot a arrow at daddy if he's bad. - "Daddy's coming." I don't know how much I've told you about my situation, but I don't think daddy knows where we are. I thought, I reacted, I reacted way too strongly. I scared her. I said, "What do you mean daddy's coming?" She said that she has a friend, an Indian, a little Indian girl. - [Woman] One that she plays with? - Well she doesn't tell me that she plays with her. She says she has dreams about her, that she came in her dreams. She said that the little Indian girl told her that daddy was coming, oh, and that the Indian girl would shoot an arrow through daddy if daddy wasn't nice. - [Woman] Whoa. - That doesn't sound to me like something a child would say. Does it to you? Doesn't sound like Eury. I mean, I don't know. I know I'm tired, that's about all I know. I know I'm scared. I know I don't want him near her, I don't want him near me, I don't want to see him ever again. I want him to go away. - God. You know, I used to feel that way. A lot. - I know, I can imagine. - One of the boy's dads would walk in the house and I'd throw things at him. One of the boys would be crying or waiting and waiting and waiting for hours, "My dad didn't come," crying, and the disappointment and stuff, but you know, all of that, I'm still glad they have their dads. I didn't have my dad, and my parents were divorced. I don't know if I told you that. My dad would come and get me. He would say he's coming Sunday at 1:00. I'd be all ready and wait wait wait wait, and then he wouldn't show, and maybe he would call later at 4:00 and say, "Well I changed my mind," or he'd come at 4:00. By that time I was in tears and hysterical. My mother said, "Well what can you expect?" I don't know. If there's some way he could be in her life without you having to suffer. The payoff for me has been that when my boys see their dads, their faces light up. They just feel solid. That feels like a solid relationship to them. That made a big difference, really a big difference for me to feel more trust in my boys' fathers, trust that they care enough and love them, that they'll do the right thing. [relaxed music] Honey, when we do make our dollhouse, I think we should give our dollhouse a name, don't you? Can you think of a name? One Heart Lane, how's that? Is that a good name? What color should we paint it? Do you know what color you'd like to paint it? How about purple? I know you like-- - White. - You wanna paint it white? White houses are beautiful. I think we should have an upstairs and a downstairs, don't you? [doorbell rings] - Daddy's here! - Eury, Eury! Don't answer the door! Eury, not the door! Eury! Stop! Eury, stop moving! Stop moving! Eury, don't [doorbell rings] touch the door. - And you must be Fay. - [Fay] Curtis? - In the flesh. - [Fay] Nice to meet you. - Fully and bodied. - [Eury] For Eury. [Curtis whistles] What is that? - Aw! Look. [harp-like instrument being strummed] Look, honey. - Play on, play on. - Peekaboo. - [Curtis] Ma-ba-bow! [harp-like instrument being strummed] - I really like your place. You feel like you were born here or something. It fits you like a glove. - I think I move in quickly. It's not my house. Actually, the cottage, there's a little cottage around the side of the house, you got in late, there's a cottage around the side of the house and that's where I stay, and I rent from the people who live here, and they're traveling, so my arrangement was I'd do some painting for them and look after their house, and I could stay here. That's why Betsy's visiting really, because otherwise I don't have room for her. - Too bad. I guess we're all caretakers, whether we own places or not. You must be part shameleon or something. It seems like you are. - [laughs] Yeah, maybe I attach quickly, comfort. [laughs] I don't know. - You like it too? - I never heard you ask about Betsy. Have you talked to her? - You know, I'm mystified. We've had a pretty unusual relationship, 80s and the 90s, where we've been corresponding mostly by mail and phone. - [Karen] Hi, Fay. - Oh. Strawberry? Shrimp? - [Karen] Hi. - [Curtis] Hi. - Curtis, this is Karen. - [Karen] Nice to meet you. - [Curtis] Okay. [suspenseful music] - Hi, honey. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Seattle. The hotel room, it's raining out there. Here it's just two seasons. There's August and there's winter. Everybody reads, so I'm selling books like crazy. Have they been getting the money? [laughs] So that means I'll be treated better when I get home, huh? Well, look, we, Right, it was hard, it was hard. We had hard times. How are Diane and Billy? Yeah. Well give them a hug for me, tell them I love them. We'll work this out. Yeah, it cut out a piece of my heart. I'll be there. Tell them I'll be, I'm never gonna leave them. Yeah, I'm a happily married man. I may stay on the road forever, but I'm gonna be back soon. Tell them daddy loves them. That never changes. Look, I gotta go. I'll call you. I'll call you from Bellingham. Yeah. Bye bye. - Did you have fun with Karen today? Yeah? Okay, should we start out with an easy one? Okay. You can't guess 'til I'm all the way done, because I could change my mind in the middle. Okay. - A heart? - A heart! You got it! Okay, I'll do another one. - My mom says she'll never get married again. She likes living with her girl friends better. - My daddy's still at camp. What happened to your old daddy? - My mom got rid of him. He got too fat for her. - Your daddy visited our house and he gave me a musical instrument. [dramatic piano music] - It's raining today. You wait a long time up in this kind of climate for a sunny day. We didn't get a sunny day today. From this window, you can see Mount Rainier. Mount Rainier is monstrous. Mount Rainier is powerful. It's strong. From this window, you can also see ferries coming in. I don't think ships land in here, but there is a saying about people's ships coming home. You wait a long time up here for a lot of things, and then sometimes, one day, for no reason, there's a knock on the door, or there's a ship in the port. [expressive music] - [Curtis] I think I'm gonna go take a shower if you don't mind. - Okay, go ahead. Are you hungry, honey? No? - Man was sitting on top of you last night. - What did you say? - My friend said a man was sitting on top of you last night on the bed. - What friend? - Tonto. - Who's Tonto? - I told you, a little Indian girl. - Did the little Indian girl say anything else? - She said that you liked it. - I need help. Your hands are too small for paintbrushes, honey. I wonder how big the Indian girl's hands are. [laughs] Are you here? [upbeat flute music] Indian? You're looking at me and I can't see you, and maybe you're not even here, and maybe I'm losing my mind. Honey, if you got to see your daddy, you think the little Indian girl would still be coming? Would she go away? - I don't know. - You don't know? - What's this? Are you a sign painter? - No. I suppose I could go in that direction, but they're just words that interest me. I look them up. - You forgot the I in lollipop. - No, that's lollop. It means to lounge about or loll. - Is that in a dictionary? - Yeah. All these are in the dictionary. - Zetetic is in the dictionary? - It's in the dictionary. I don't know what it means. No, it's in, I found it in a thesaurus, an old thesaurus. I don't know, I don't remember what that one means. I did that one a while ago. I don't know what it means and it's black. The other ones the colors match what they mean in my mind. - Hmm. I don't know art, but I know what I like. I like it. - Good. You can buy it. - 20 bucks? - I usually go for 50, but I'll think about it, maybe. - Suppertime, we'll ... - Okay. - Make the transaction. - All right. - Some house. Yard's nice too. - [Karen] Thanks. - What's this? Muliebrity. - Muliebrity. - Muliebrity? - Yeah. - Like mule deer, or like mule? I've got a mule. - [Karen] Yeah? - Sounds like a cross between mule and celebrity to me. - No, it actually, it means the characteristics of being a woman. [Curtis laughs] Or the state of being a woman, or the characteristics of women. - Anglo women or all women or... - Just women, all women, I think. - Do you have to wear these? - Yeah, actually, I do. My eyesight's really bad. I have... It's really bad. I can't see much. [Curtis whistles] [Curtis and Karen laugh] Yeah, those are crazy. I look cross-eyed sometimes. - Your drawings are better than your eyesight. - Thanks. That's not saying much though, so [laughs] I don't know, no, that's not, I don't know. - Can I have some of your vitamin C? - Sure, stay healthy. - Helen Gurley Brown says that sex is like vitamin C, you need a little every day. - [laughs] All right. Well I have my vitamin C every day. - Well I don't get much sex every day. I think half the people in America go to bed unloved and by themselves, whether they're with somebody or not. - Yeah, but sex isn't just... There's a difference between sex and love and sex. - You have to start somewhere though, don't you? - I suppose. I'd rather start with love. - Hey. - Don't. Just don't. I'd rather you didn't do that. - [laughs] Well, what, we don't get meaningful looks across the salami for dinner or something? - No. I'm just nothing. I have a boyfriend. I'm rather attached to him. - Now you've got two. - No. I really, I don't, I don't want two. Just get out, okay? Just go. - Is that what you really want? - Yes! That's what I really want. Asshole. - I don't think that's what you really want. - What do you know what I want?! I just met you! - Well you're right, I don't know what you want. I don't really know anything. - You're right! Don't! God. Stop! - Mule. Muliebrity, that's a good word. - Yeah, it is a good word. What do you want? Just go away. Forget it. Don't! Stop! Just get out! Stop! - [Fay] Honey, are you all right? - [Curtis] Maybe something she ate. I think I'm gonna go water the plants. - Okay. Come sit with mama, hon. Are you worried about something? Look at me, honey. - You okay? - I'm fine. - Well why do you suppose blacks and Hispanics don't make any fuss about date rape? - I don't know! - It's because they understand the way the game is played. - Oh fuck you! I don't play that way! - Upscale yups, they dress like that, and it's like living in New York and leaving the car keys on the hood. - [Fay] Got the last one. Excuse me. More water? - No, I'm fine. - Well do you think Kennedy, the Kennedy guy down at the compound is gonna, gonna get let off? - I hope not. - Or do you think maybe she ought to be charged? - For what?! - For going back to the house with him. What could she possibly expect? - What makes you think that men have the right to do that to women? - Well I think things between men and women are hot. Get used to it. It's a good deal. - What's a good deal? - This thing that is a supposed attraction between, between men and women, between [laughs] what seem to be two-- - Men think it's hot. Women think it's lovely. Does that create a problem? - That'd be fine, hot and lovely, it couldn't be better. You got any idea what time it is? - I don't wear a watch. I don't have the time. I can go look. - I don't know. - I'm gonna go get a haircut. See ya. - Bye, honey. - How long is he staying? - I think about a week. I don't know. I'd have to ask Betsy. - I thought maybe we could get shampooed, cleaned. Particular I want some taken off the back at the bottom. I want to see my collar. - Do you want it up above the ears, trimmed up around the ears, and just a little off the back? - It's okay around the ears, I think, but in the back. - So just trim up the back, but not the top? - That's okay too. - Okay. And we're gonna shampoo it? - Mm-hmm [affirmative]. And I noticed that you had a scalp massage. What's that? - That's where we put cholesterol in your hair and massage it into your scalp and it feels real good, relaxes you. - I never get touched enough. - [laughs] You don't, huh? - No, so a massage sounds good. - A massage will do it. [laughs] - [Fay] In your cottage? - Yes. - [Fay] He grabbed you and kissed you? - Yeah. - [Fay] Curtis grabbed you and kissed you? - Yeah. - [Fay] What'd you do? - I said, "Stop!" I don't want that. - [Fay] That makes me feel unhappy. [laughs] - Yeah. - There must be a boyfriend. - I go out dancing, meet somebody here and there, pretty much stick to myself. I'm pretty busy with my kids and my business. - [Karen] I just, I thought he was going out with your sister. - He's going out with my sister, I think. I mean... What is it with men? [laughs] - [Karen] I don't know. - Would you do that again? - One more time? - [Curtis] Faster. [woman laughs] [machine whirs and beeps] - [Curtis] Whoa! - [Machine] You stupid! You stupid! - [Curtis] You betcha! You betcha, Charlie! Hit me. Bust. - You gotta stop trying for those five and under, Curtis. You're gonna give me cavities with all the M&Ms I'm winning. [laughs] - [Curtis] I want it all or nothing. - You're getting nothing. - [Curtis] I've noticed. - Karen told me you kissed her today. Did you kiss Karen today? - Darling, that girl wouldn't know a kiss if it came up and bit her. There goes the mistletoe theory. I was raised to, you know, kiss all the girls, and to go home with one, but if she thinks that was a kiss, it takes all the fun out of it. - Well, Karen seems really bothered. I don't know what went on, and what went on isn't my business. - [Curtis] What do you girls want then? You want me to act and dress like Marlon Brando, but think like Fred MacMurry. - [Fay] I don't want you bothering anybody in my house. - Well then I... Have you seen this drawing here? What is it supposed to mean? What's the... Is there any hidden meaning behind it or... - [Fay] It's a picture of a root growing up from a sewer. - I like the idea. - [Fay] Curtis, what if I were to tell Be-- [phone rings] - [Curtis] Well, want me to get that? - I'll get it. Excuse me. - [Curtis] Let's just drop this whole thing, okay? - [Fay] Hello? Betsy! How are you? - [Curtis] About time. - [Fay] How much more? [phone rings] - [Voiceover] Hello? - Hello, Fay? This is Robert. - [Voiceover] What do you want, Robert? - I'd like to see Eury and you. - [Voiceover] Robert, how did you get my telephone number? - Well, I got it, and I'm calling you, and I'd like to, I'd like to see Eury. - [Voiceover] How did you get my telephone number? - Well I had somebody look you up. I had an investigator. - [Voiceover] I've been investigated?! Why didn't you leave a message at my mother's for me?! - Well you weren't investigated. It was more like trying to find out where you were. So now I got your number and your address, and I know where you are. I wouldn't wanna talk to your mother. You know how she feels about me. - [Voiceover] You spent money finding out where I am and I haven't heard anything from you for years?! No money. - I've had my money problems. That's why I couldn't send it to you, but now I've got lots of money. Listen, I set up a trust fund for Eury and I'm sending you a check, so you can live a little more comfortably. I think we should start over, start anew. Let me see my daughter. - [Voiceover] There's something ironic in that, Robert, a trust fund for Eury? You wanna see this child? What are you trying to buy? - Listen, I've made mistakes in my life. I have had financial problems. These are all straightening, and I'm still trying to straighten these things out. Someday she'll wanna see her real father, and I think we should just think about that. - [Voiceover] I have never denied you a thing, Robert! You're the one that walked away! You wanna come back when it's convenient for you! I'm not gonna get, I'm not gonna let myself get mad. Robert, you're gonna see this child when it works for her, not when it's convenient for you. It's not up to me, it's not up to you. It's her turn to make a choice. You had that opportunity once, and you walked. I had the opportunity to make my choices, and I did what I did, I stayed. Now I'm going to do what I have to do to preserve her right to make her choice when it's good for her to do so. - Yes, but at the same time, I think she should know that I do care, right now. I don't want her to go on, you know, when she's 18 or something and wonder what happened to her father. I want her to know that I'm at least trying to make an effort to see her. Now isn't that fair? - [Voiceover] What do you want, Robert? - I wanna see her. I wanna start seeing her. - [Voiceover] How often? - Whenever, you know, just let her, let her know that I exist. - [Voiceover] Whenever doesn't work, Robert. Consistency, schedule. If you come, if you don't come, you say you're gonna come, and you don't show up, once, I mean but once, do you know what that's gonna do to her? I am not going to let you treat her the way you've treated me. It was good enough for me. I shouldn't have taken it, and it's not good enough for my daughter. - I promise, I won't, I wouldn't do that again. I've changed my ways here. I'm missing something in life. I feel the guilt. I feel it. I don't want to live with this anymore. I wanna start straightening it out, and whatever you think is right is okay with me, as long as we just start it, okay? That's fine with me. Just let her know I exist. I'll give her some money and you can get her some clothes or whatever she needs, help out with the rent and the food, that kind of thing, you know, regular, I'll support her. Let's get joint custody here or something. - [Voiceover] I can't believe what I'm hearing. Joint custody? Robert, I have to think about this. I mean, you call out of nowhere. I don't hear from you. You leave me with the whole responsibility because, quote, you think I can handle it, and now you want all this stuff because you're feeling guilty. Well, I don't even know what to say. If you're going to see this child, it's because I think it's good for her, not because your guilt is the moving, is the motivating impetus here at all. I'm gonna call you back. What's your number? - Okay, I'm area code 4-1-5, 3-3-9 0-6-7-8. - [Voiceover] When did you move to California, Robert? - About six months ago. - [Voiceover] And why didn't you tell me that?! If I needed to get a hold of you, how could I have gotten a hold of you?! I don't have money to go hire private investigators! I'm gonna talk to you later. Bye. - Listen, we both have our numbers now, so what's the problem? - [Voiceover] I'm gonna call you later. I can't talk now. - So... She hung up. - What's this?! It stinks like a bar in here! You're gonna go meet your girlfriend! Pile of clothes, look at this mess! I hope you don't make it to the ferry. - Open the door and who do we see? - [Fay And Betsy] Twisted orange people! [Fay and Betsy laugh] - He's back. [Fay and Betsy laugh] - This is really fun. What are you gonna say? - Earth to Fay, earth to Miss B. - I don't live on earth. [laughs] - I haven't been on earth either in the past couple of days. - I noticed. [laughs] - Hey, you mind if we, if we cut the cold steel here? - What's that? - It's a country witticism. We refer to talking true, back where I live. - I'd be interested in hearing you talk true. - Well I'm married. - [Betsy] Married? - Yeah. - [Betsy] Now? - Now. But not for long. I've got two kids. My wife has been flying around the country with a pilot, and the housekeeper looks after them. When I call back, sometimes she's there, sometimes the housekeeper's there, but my friends have told me what's going on. - [Fay] The housekeeper's looking after the children? - Mm-hmm [affirmative]. - Why did you choose now to tell me all this? - [Curtis] Because this household I've been in, and your sister is so good, and your niece is so fine. - Yes they are and I'm-- - [Curtis] That I did not-- - Starting to worry about them being in a household with you. - [Curtis] Well, their goodness... Okay, so shoot me, but this is the way it is, and for us to go any further, I wanted her to know that, I want you to know that, and-- - [Fay] What did you want me to know? - [Curtis] I want you to know that I'm married, I've been a beast, I've been... - You still are married, and you... - [Curtis] I still am married, but you know, instead of trying to kill that guy, and feel like I'd lost this woman who was running around with him-- - [Fay] Wait a minute, wait. - [Curtis] I feel like I've met somebody else that's real, that's-- - Why would you care if he was messing around with your wife if you had nothing to do with her anyway? If you didn't love her, then what's all this? - [Curtis] Because she hurt me so bad, I was-- - So why are you going after someone, talking about killing somebody? What? - [Curtis] It's just knee jerk male stuff. - I think you're just mad at yourself. - [Curtis] That may be, that may be. Needless to say, I'm very confused, and I've took, I hit the road, I... - You should hit it again. - I don't mean to-- - [Curtis] I'm done with it. - I'm done with it too. - You should think about it. - [Fay] I don't mean to interrupt, but let me ask, does anybody have a watch? I gotta get back to Eury and Karen's got things to do. - You don't wanna hear this. - Okay, well, I gotta go. - I don't wanna hear it either. - Wake up. - [Karen's Boyfriend] What's up? - You're boring. There's something I really have to tell you. Do you know Fay's sister's friend, Curtis? - [Karen's Boyfriend] What? - He's here. He's visiting. He seemed really nice, and-- - [Karen's Boyfriend] Wait, wait, what happened with him? - [Karen] I'll tell you. It's really hard. He was interested in my art, and so I came and sat down on the bed, and I don't know, I just, I sat down next to him, and I guess I shouldn't have. I didn't read the signals right. - She asked him to leave, he tried to kiss her, she pushed him away, he left and then he came back, and he just, he totally grabbed her, and she's telling him to back off, stop, back off, and he gets up, and then whammo, he's back on her again. [Fay's fist slams against the table] - [Fay] That's it, I'm talking to Curtis. I'll tell you later what I'm gonna do. I'm so tired of people like you! Get up! I think I need dark, dark sunglasses, because what I see is never what I'm looking at, and no matter what I go through, I still create what I see. - You file the papers, it's your idea. No, I'm not gonna call again. Just forget about me. - Robert? Okay, Robert, I'm tired of thinking about all of this. This is what I'm gonna do. If you wanna come and see Eury, I've got Saturday afternoon on the 20th of July. I'll wait. Okay. 20th of July, Saturday afternoon. If you can be here at 3:00 and understand that I have to leave at 4:25, that gives you an hour and 25 minutes to spend in this house that you can come on that day, and Robert, 3:00 does not mean a quarter of 3:00, it does not mean 3:15. I'm meeting a friend, and that's not your business. Mm-hmm [affirmative]. I don't know. You have to catch a small plane. You'll have to make arrangements. But it's not early. You've got time. Robert, what are you gonna say when you walk in the door? I don't want any of this, "Here's daddy." I don't lie to her, Robert. Okay. That works. I will. Anything else? Okay. See you then. Bye. - Hey Karen, you know, with that Dances With Wolves flick, it's like the whole thing is just romanticizing Indians. Little Big Man had done everything that, quote, he was doing that was supposed to be new. I just don't get what he was trying to do. He was just showing good Indians and bad Indians, and he was romanticizing the good Indians, and totally dehumanizing the bad ones. - Look, I don't even know what you're talking about. I haven't even seen Dances With Wolves, so what's your point? A film that everybody likes that I don't like is Citizen Kane. The cinematographer, Gregg Toland, he was the one who made the film. Orson Welles, he had a story, but he didn't really, it has nothing to do with it. - [Karen's Boyfriend] Orson Welles, even on the fly, he just pulled together that narrative right on the set. He tied in the sled and the whole ending was just beautiful. There's no way that just the cinematographer could've pulled that film off. - [Karen] It wasn't that great though. The story, it's not such a moving story. It's not number one film of the year or whatever. - [Karen's Boyfriend] Not of the year, but of the century. - [Karen] No, really! - [Karen's Boyfriend] It's the context. - [Karen] No. - [Karen's Boyfriend] Put it into the context of when that film was done. It was done in... [playful flute music] [Eury screams] - [Beekeeper] Wait a minute, hey, wait. Hey, honey, this is not a game, stop! [Eury screams] Come on, honey, this is no place to hide. [frenzied flute music] Girl! Hey, it's me, the one-armed guy. I'm not gonna hurt you, but there's stuff out here that can hurt you. Hey, little girl? Hey! You know me. Little girl? You gotta be careful out here. You can get in a lot of trouble. Little girl! Where'd you go? [phone rings] - Hello? Karen? No! No! No! No! No! - Hello? - [Fay] No! No! - [Voiceover] When we sat down at the grave site, Robert held my hand, and so I understood that he had feelings that I had. Somehow that touch and Eury's death helped me realize that the burden of his threat was no more a part of my life, and he could stand it in that horrible grief, lonely space with me, and I wanted companionship. I think Eury would want him to know how she felt. I'm the only one that can tell him now. [knocking at the door] - Hi. - [Fay] Hi. - You okay? - Pretty much. - I was working on these stencil drawings. It gets better. It goes away. It's hard to believe. That's what people told me. - I want it to go away. - I know. [laughs] I know, that's how I felt too, but time makes it so you can deal with it. It makes it so it never stops hurting as bad, but you have longer spaces in between, and so that you can live your life, and you'll have more children. - I don't wanna live my life. It seems like it desecrates her somehow. - [Debra] And all those feelings about if you'd known that was her last night on earth or if you'd known that was her last day on earth, that's what I think. - Yeah, if you'd known. - [Debra] If only I'd known, but I didn't. Every time I say goodnight to my kids now, I think that, I think I'm saying goodnight as if it was your last night. It's really important. It's made a much closer bond between me and my children. - Does life feel more fragile to you, or less? - [Debra] I don't feel like the world's a real safe place. That's part of it. Part of it's the loss and the actual death, and part of it's just the shocking thing that that kind of thing can happen in your life, because you always grow up thinking that's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen to me, it's not gonna happen to people I know. When it happens to you, you realize, this can really happen. That's the scary part, that every night, or every time you say goodbye to someone, it could really be the last time, and you know that now. It changes how you are with people and how you are with your children and people that you care about, because you have that idea that they're not always gonna be there the way that you thought they were. - It's so hard to forget that I was tired and I wanted time to myself and I couldn't think straight, and I had somebody take her to the park, and I know if she had been with me... - Don't say that, because that's not necessarily true. I have a huge problem with guilt, because we were in a car and I just sort of drove over a cliff, on a road that I'd been on all my life, in the dark, in the rain, everywhere. It was a nice sunny day, and we just, off the cliff. Thomas was dead in two hours. It was just that kind of a shock. I felt really guilty. I had killed my son. I went to a counselor, first time in my life. They said, "You need to go to a counselor, Debra." I said, "Okay, I'll go to a counselor." I told the counselor the story and she just bawled, and I thought, [laughs] it's nice, but it's not gonna help me. She sent me to this psychic. I'd never been to a psychic, never heard of one. I went. I'll do anything. I went and her first thing was, "How dare you? "What a huge ego you have "to think that you have anything to do with life and death, "to think that your spirit doesn't have some "idea of its own choices through life and death," and that you don't, even as a mother, that you don't have that choice for your children, that she felt Thomas made that choice at that time in his life, for him, and that it was my ego that had the guilt, that... - I see that. That really clicks, because I think back on some things that she was telling me about, some dreams she was having, and a little visitor, and I kept thinking to myself, "This doesn't sound like what a child would say." She's telling me about a little Indian friend visiting her in her dreams, and I kept thinking, "This is not what a child would say." It was like something else coming through. - [Debra] Maybe those spirits were her guardians, and they were taking her. I wonder, I look back too and think, would I have known, should I have known? But even if you know, I don't think you can change what's meant to be. I guess I have a feeling that things are meant to be. - I'm hot. You wanna go out? - [Debra] Yeah. - Have any more lemonade? - [Debra] Mm-hmm [affirmative]. - [Fay] I know it's sunny out. I feel better in the sun. [laughs] - Tonto? Tonto? Are you Tonto? Robert, it's Fay. I've been trying to reach you. I don't know where you are. I need to meet you in 15 minutes at the path. I met Tonto today. I'm going to go down and pick Eury up from the underworld, and if you can be there, I hope you get this message. I'm so excited. I hope you'll be there. I'll look for you. Bye.
