Jacob? My time has come. And? Relieved? Are you sad? Happy even? Do you feel anything, Jacob? ...I thought you... - I don't know. - Pity. I had really hoped... - It might still happen? - No. But this is enough. I love you. I love you too, Mum. Mum? For her, love wasn't an empty word. She cared for the less fortunate. As founder of the Van Zuylen Foundation... she was a model of selfless love. Thank you. Goodbye. Mr. Van Zuylen? Do you have a moment? Jacob, the donation you made yesterday on behalf of you and your mother... is very generous... and the Foundation is wondering if 2 mistakes were made. We fear it is so generous... that after the estate has been sold you'll be left bankrupt. - Bankrupt? - It's likely. Mr. Van Zuylen, Mr. De Wijs... Is there a problem? - Can I be of any help? - Vermeer, the Foundation is worried? Mr. Van Zuylen's recent contribution... It's very generous, but was made after careful consideration. Wasn't it, Mr. Van Zuylen? Jacob, are you sure you want to do this? I am indeed. So if you'll excuse me now. I wish you all a pleasant afternoon. You too, Mr. Van Zuylen. He's looking well today. Good day, sir. Sir? Come on. - Good afternoon, Mr. Van Zuylen - Good day, sir. - Good morning, Mr. Van Zuylen - Sir. - Good day, sir. - Sir. Good day, s... - Good day, sir. - Sir. Jacob! Jacob! Muller. Such a beautiful ceremony this morning. I think Mother would have appreciated it. You were walking around with a backpack. Final inspection. The estate is for sale. Vermeer is putting it on the market today. It got cloudy, so I wanted to take a car. You're selling? All things come to an end, Muller. I'll miss it here. Your mother. You too. - I'll miss you, Jacob. - I understand. Jacob? You look well today. Thank you, Muller. I feel well. Good morning. Good day. Or should I say: "Gute Reise". Thank you very much. Farewell. Don't you have anything eco-friendly? - I'm afraid not. - These all contain lead. You must have something else. Do you work here? I thought you were part of it. A traveller. Traveller? Are you serious? - Absolutely. - Gosh Well, I'm a traveller too. I thought you might be. But don't let me interrupt you. I believe we have a choice to make. Well, that's not so easy, really. May I ask: is your itinerary set in stone or will you see how things evolve? Not knowing where and when? I found it hard to decide beforehand. - None of my business of course. - No. No, I mean... I understand. I couldn't choose either. I thought it was best to make it a surprise trip. Exactly. - Van Zuylen de With. - Anne, Anne de Koning Clients are not allowed to mingle, it's in our contract. Well, then... Nice to make your acquaintance. All the best. Thank you. You too. Good morning Mr. Van Zuylen. Muller, I've been thinking... there are quite a few people around here. - They are staff, Jacob. - Of course. But... I'll be going on a trip. And as the estate is being sold, I suggest sending them home. Tell them to drop everything and give them a year's salary. Don't forget the Christmas bonus. Thank you, Muller. Miss de Koning, you're late. We started. Sorry... I'll forgive you if you mind the shop on Friday morning. Friday? I don't know if I'll be around. Okay ladies, let's continue. If your Apollo line is broken, life will bring us ups and downs... If it's long and deep, like mine... we'll have a magnetic effect on others. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Hello? Come on then. I'm over here. Hello? - Van Zuylen? - Himself. It's Anne de Koning. We met by the coffins. The coffins... of course! Did you find an eco-friendly model? Yes, eventually. Made of recycled wood... ...gone in less than ten years. Guaranteed. Well, look at that. I'm calling because it's been three days and I wanted to know if you... - You picked up... - So you know the answer. Yes indeed, sorry. - A pleasant journey and good luck. - Who was that? Someone looking for a travel guide. Wrong number. I wish you luck as well. Sunny periods and partly cloudy... Hello? Hello? Anybody down there? Hello? Muller, you caught me off guard. Well done. - I thought you'd left. - Almost. Indeed. - I thought you'd left as well. - I have left. - I came to see that everything's in order. - And is {7? The Rosa Agrestis needs pruning. The Sweet Briar in the rose gardens. Muller, you're a free man. Do what you enjoy. Then I'd like to tend the Rosa Agrestis. Oh. Well, go ahead. Then they'll blossom again in August. Muller! Muller! Muller! - What day is it today? - Friday. What do I do on Friday? Normally? Until recently your mother would take you dancing. I'm sorry, Jacob. Muller, life goes on. I'd like to go dancing. I want to dance. Thank you. Mr. Van Zuylen. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I was nearby and was wondering if you'd care to dance. I mean: to have lunch. There's this place not too far from here. I realise this is all a bit unexpected. I can't leave. I don't work here, but have to mind it. The owner is back late. Only the charmstones... Hello, have we met? Marissa Delarue. I'm Van Zuylen de With. - Anything the matter? - Just checking your aura. Won't hurt. Miss De Koning, I won't need you anymore. So you can kidnap her as planned, right? I sense that he won't disappoint you. - But I have a class. - You can easily skip it. - So modest... - I don't want to. - Yet outspoken. - I'm staying here. Lovely temperament. You don't need any more lessons. She's my best student. Give her your hand and she'll tell you what lies ahead. Bye now. - I'm over there, are you coming? - No. What are you doing here and how did you find me? You called me from this shop. Why did you just call back? I was afraid you'd turn me down. Are you part of it? Part of what? Of it. Of them. Are you my Surprise? - Of course. I hadn't thought of that. - Well? - What? - Are you? Your Surprise? I don't think so. What if you are? Or what if I am? I could be yours and you could be mine. You didn't think of that? Or don't you care? Given the circumstances, it doesn't matter. Does it? Maybe you're right. I just had to ask. Of course. Facel Vega 500. Not bad. V8. 6.3? I think so. - May 17? - Of course. You come here often? Every Friday. With my mother. But she passed away last week. It's none of my business, but is that why you... No, not at all. I've been wanting it for years. But as long as my mother was alive, I couldn't. Very sweet of you. I was just being considerate I hardly knew my parents. They died in a car crash when I was little. The family next door took me in. Later they adopted me as their own daughter. - How nice of them. - Yes, that was nice. And they meant well of course. They still do. But somehow I don't feel that I really belong, the way I'd like to. What do you mean? People see me how they'd like to. But they don't see who you truly are. Care to dance? - Pardon? - Maybe you'd like to dance? Just briefly. They say I'm a pretty good dancer. I'm sure you are, but I... Van Zuylen, dear boy. I need to take a breather. Could you look after Johanna for a minute? If the young lady doesn't object? - Do you mind? - Of course not, go ahead. Thank you. Hello Johanna, do you fancy a tango this afternoon? Remarkable fellow, that Van Zuylen. A little weird at times, a bit stiff... But altogether a very decent chap. - Have you thought about the afterlife? - I'm afraid not. I believe that everything around us is all at a certain "level". And when we travel, we move up to the next level. A higher level where things are better for us and where we become better people. Because we moved up. - You mean to the next floor? - Exactly. I don't seem to be getting very far on this floor. Perhaps there's more, but it's just not meant for me. Know the feeling? I'm afraid so. So, hoping things will get better, you're taking the elevator? And someone else has to push the button. Yes, I want to be a Buddhist. Buddhists can't push any buttons themselves. Besides, that would be cheating. You probably think I'm crazy. No, I think it's fascinating. Well, you look a bit confused. Miss De Koning, perhaps you should see this. I believe I have very good news. We may just go together. What do you mean? Mr. Jones said it could happen any moment now. That's a serious truck. - When did you last speak to Jones? - This morning. What do you reckon? 25 or 30 tons? - Plus the cargo. - Oh dear. - This'll hurt. - Only for a moment. - Mr. Van Zuylen? - Miss De Koning. - May I hold your hand? - Sure. Miss De Koning, I'm sorry I frightened you. - I honestly thought... - I'm sorry too. We shouldn't stay here too long. Mr. Van Zuylen, if that truck hadn't swerved... I might have jumped out of its way. You stayed very calm. Your adrenaline doesn't kick in? - My...? - Your adrenaline... - 1 boosts your excitement. - Oh no, I don't think it does. Come on, you were just as thrilled as me. I wish I was. I wish I was... thrilled or excited. But I wasn't. Because I never am. Never? Impossible. Surely you must have felt something? - Weren't you just a little scared? - I'm afraid not. It's okay to admit it. I would love to, but... There's something between me and the world... An invisible wall. Made of glass. I can see everything, but nothing is able to affect me. That must be horrible. It's the reason I'd like to travel. I'm really looking forward to it. Thanks for the nice afternoon. There's no one I'd rather be run over by a truck with. And if I don't see you anymore, all the best on the next floor. Happy travels to you too, Jacob. Drive safely. Early this morning, a mysterious explosion shook Brussels. One apartment in a building was destroyed. The surrounding apartments remained miraculously unscathed. At the scene is our reporter Hine Veldman. Is there news of any victims? No, I live on the other side. Such loving people... Yes... Jacob? Are you all right? Yes. Just tying my shoes. What's going on? Gas explosion. Elderly German couple. Terrible. It's a miracle no one else was hurt. I saw a German couple with Mr. Jones - That's why it's taking so long. - It wasn't our turn. - What are you doing here? - Pardon? - Why are you here? - Oh, well... When I took you to lunch, I noticed your interest in cars. 356 Speedster, original, rare. Why? I have some more and was wondering... Would you like to come and have a look at them? You mean now? Sure, why not? - Yes. - Van Zuylan. Where were you? I phoned all morning. Some Russian investors just flew in to buy the estate. This is Vermeer, my lawyer. Vermeer, Anne de Koning. They're offering 4% above the asking price and a bonus if we sign today. That's good news. Take care of it, Vermeer? You'll have to come. Meeting a true aristocrat is quite an attraction for some. It will speed up the sale. - Do you mind? - Go ahead. I'll be fine. - I'll be right back. - No rush. Vermeer, give me two minutes to change. Miss, I hate to intrude... but Mr. Van Zuylen rarely invites a lady to the house. May I be so blunt as to ask how you met? At a travel agency. A travel agency? Is he planning a trip? Hasn't he told you? Normally he does. I run his whole life, you know. I'm sure he'll fill you in then. The apple is nature's generosity. The dagger warns of the pitfalls of abundance. The burden of wealth. I'm waiting for Jacob. You're his dance partner? Anne, Anne de Koning. Cornald Muller, estate supervisor. Ex-supervisor... I used to live here, but it's being sold. - If I'm in the way... - No, please stay. May I introduce you to the old Jacob van Zuylen: officer in the Order of the Crown... with his wife Rebecca, who gave him twelve sons. Seven portraits of them are here. Jacob's mother too? Elisabeth. The only child of a pastor. A teacher by profession. - She was beautiful. - But most unlucky in love. She believed she'd stay single forever. She was nearly forty when this man came along. She made him work hard to get her. But once she gave in... they became the happiest couple this house has ever seen. A fairy-tale. Almost too good to be true. Indeed. Mr. Van Zuylen had a mistress. - There. I knew 1. - The sea. His mistress was the sea. Van Zuylen was a sailor. He was building a yacht to take his son around the world. Jacob was only four, but bright and eager. The voyage filled him with joy. One day his father went to sea to test the foresails. Neither he nor his yacht were ever seen again. And Jacob? Since his father disappeared, he hasn't cried or laughed once. Never again. In 36 years, we have never seen him angry. Nor sad. The eager little boy grew silent. His mother tried everything to help him. Psychiatrists, doctors... She let him go car racing, deep-sea diving, mountain climbing... anything that she thought might jolt him back to life. And what about... women? Suffice to say: no experiments were shunned to awaken his passions. Quite a remarkable lady, that Miss De Koning. Fascinating. Never met anyone like her. She said you're going on a trip. - We both are. - Where are you going? No idea. She thinks it might be the next level. The next floor, Vermeer. I have business at home. Can we rush through the formalities? Of course we can. Mr. Van Zulyen, please. A spa with cosmetic surgery and the latest rejuvenation treatments. Rejuvenation? Is there a market for that? - So, done. - Not quite. 48 hours, is that necessary? See anything you like? Are they all being sold? Depressing. Can I cheer you up by offering you a ride? Do I get to drive? This is quite a temperamental little lady. 495PK, from 0 to 100 in 4.3 seconds. - You're an expert. - I grew up with brothers. Knowing about cars was the only way to get any attention. The clutch requires a very delicate touch, so... A very kind man, your Mr. Muller. A good employee. Absolutely. There's something about him. A certain sadness. When I was born, my mother hired a nanny: Aline. Muller fell in love and they married. Later, she became head of the household. She died last winter. That's what I feel. He misses her. If you were sure that tomorrow was your last day on earth... out of all things you could do, what would you choose? Today I'd go back to the place tomorrow where we had lunch yesterday. - To go dancing? - Yes. Can I come too? - Would you dance with me? - Yes. I'm not very good though. - Muller. - Jacob. - Are you all right? - Terrific. May I come in for a moment? I don't live here anymore. Oh yes. How true. The new owners must be pleased with such well pruned... Roses. The transfer is tomorrow. Did I say it's all been sold? No. But I can see if I can fix us something hot. Do you know what will happen to my rose garden? I believe they'll build a sauna or hot tub. Here? In my garden? Muller, do you remember the first time you saw her? - Aline. - Yes, of course. Did you immediately feel she was special? Absolutely. And you knew instantly? How about you light the stove. You knew, right? I didn't know anything anymore. Muller, very strange things are happening to me these past few days. Yesterday I was almost run over by a truck. The weird thing was... at the very last moment, just before I was about to get hit... I felt something... something inside me. This isn't as good as Aline's, but it is hot. Rice pudding. It's been a while. Was it fear? It was above all... strange. Maybe you were afraid to lose something. That's good. Leave a message after the beep. Vermeer? Van Zuylen. I wish to exclude Muller's cottage from the contract. I won't sell it. There'll be no hot-tubbing in his garden or the deal is off. I take it you'll see to it right away. Good night. Old beat up Range Rover. Clich. But part of the package, right? Ready to dance? If you don't mind, somewhere else first. Anne, I believe we have to take action. - We should? - Yes. You and me. - We can't go on like this. - No. - No? - We have to travel. We've waited long enough. I'll tell them to honour the agreement. Not next week, not tomorrow. But right now. I want a delay. I so hate it when this happens. What can we do? There's always a risk. It happened before. - Right, all taken care of. - What? I think we're top of their list now. Jacob? I don't know about you, but I had a great time yesterday. - And I was looking forward to today. - Sure. So was I. So what's the rush? Who's that? No... Seriously? They're shooting at us! - They're shooting, against the rules. - Totally. What are you doing?! You can't shoot! It's against the rules! Jacob, let me drive, please. I don't think it's the right time. Move over. What's she doing? I didn't sign up for this. I was supposed to have an accident. A plain and simple accident. This isn't an accident. This is screwing up my Karma. Your what? My Karma. If I die violently, it will stick to my Karma. - To your Karma? - Yes, to my Karma. And just how long will that affect you? My entire next life. Anne... I'm sorry I got you into this. - 1 have 10 confess... - Quiet! I'm sorry about your car. - Where is she? - You're asking me? - Are you okay? - You have hidden talents. So do you, Jacob. Anne, what happened is all my fault. No. Maybe you were right. It was good to ask them to come after us. I didn't. I asked for a delay. - You asked for a delay? Why? - I don't know. Since yesterday, I've been confused. That's okay. I'm a little confused too. But that doesn't mean we cancelled our trip, right? Oh no... It's just temporary. - As long as we're confused. - Yes. Yes. - Shall we practice some more? - My God. What happened to your leg? I was in a car with a temperamental driver. We need ice on that. Don't move, just a moment. I was going to ask you that. What do you mean? Me and your brothers here are wondering what's going on. Well? Nothing. I'm with the client. That's all. So what's taking you so long? I'm waiting for the right moment. - The right moment? - Yes, Khuram. - Why haven't you done it? - Because you screwed up. - We screwed up? - Yes, you too! I did what? You tried to drive me off the road! I don't recall that happening. I barely scratched it. You should all be ashamed. We should never have adopted her. Apologize. Stop it! Stop it! Hey, I dozed off for a minute. - You scared me. - Been back long? No. I couldn't find any ice. There was no one at reception. That's okay. My family has a hunting cabin in the forest nearby. We can hide. - We could drive there tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow? It's only a suggestion. Anne? Would you mind reading my hand? Now? I've never been interested in the future... but I'd like to know what's in store for me. Okay. See... It's never a good idea to read the palm of someone lying... being so close. Sleep tight. Okay, come here... - That tickles. - It does? - So does that. - And that? Don't do that. - And tickling you to death? - No, don't. - You can't take it? - No, please don't. I really can't take it. I'll get you back. I can stand it. - Goodnight, Jacob. - Goodnight, Anne. No one's been here for years. - Is that the only way to get here? - Yes. Muller used to bring me fishing here. We still have stuff in the car. Anne? Are you coming? Race you! No, no, take this... Go, go, go! What's this? Is this yours? I'm sorry, Jacob. I'm terribly sorry. Okay, come on. Shoot me. I was ready before, but now I'm really ready. I'll do it myself, then. Sorry. I said sorry, didn't 17? Listen, I'm sorry I deceived you... but I want you to know that 95% of what I told you... about who I am and what I feel is completely true. Like what? Like: "Are you my Surprise?" "What if I'm yours? I might be." Or doesn't that worry you? - You said it didn't make any difference. - Well, it does now! - You're angry. - What? Angry. Angry? - Angry. You're actually angry. - I'm not angry. Well, you look angry. I never get angry. I don't have it in me. That's what I heard, but... I'm not angry! A little irritated, perhaps? Fine. You're not angry. I get it. And last night you weren't laughing. Last night was the biggest mistake of my life. What's going on in there? - She got you good, didn't she? - Shut up. It's all your fault. Me? How can it be my fault? Mum wanted a girl. Instead she got you. Then look what happened. I promised I'd have you in the morgue by noon. I'd like to stay a bit longer. If we don't hurry, you'll stay here forever. I should have kept my money. All the money in the world can't save us. At noon the foundation gets the money from the estate. Unless I cancel the sale and keep it. You can? You can keep it? - Yes. The estate, the house... - The cars... If I cancel the sale before noon, it's mine... Ours. - There's no signal here. - Let's go. Wait. Don't move. - What? - Legs first. - Hello? - Vermeer? Vermeer, listen carefully. Cancel the whole sale. All of it. Not just the cottage. You heard me? Vermeer, are you there? You hear me? - Loud and clear. - Tell them I won't be selling. I understand. I'll tell them straight away. - I'll come and explain. - Not necessary. Just leave it to me. It'll be taken care of. I should go myself. Is this really happening. This girl... Bro, take it easy. Some other time, huh? Hold on tight. Boys, what are you doing? You want to be here all day?! Vermeer? Are you sure this whole deal is in Jacob's best interest? Mr. De Wijs We both know that Van Zuylen is nothing but a child. Rich, spoiled, possibly retarded and above and above all utterly irresponsible. The good news is that in a few minutes our pockets will be stuffed. And we'll be free of him forever. Good day. Sorry, Mr. Van Zuylen. Just leaving. All taken care of. I want to apologise for any inconvenience I may have caused. How thoughtful of you. Don't let me keep you. We'll speak later okay? Excuse me. Excuse. - I'm in a bit of a hurry - Sir. What's that? Are you playing a game, sir? All units, I have an 10-107 in the lobby. Take a seat, sir? I'm Van Zuylen. Don't you recognize me? Please, sit down. Of course, but first I'd like to... Please sit down, sir. - I understand, but I'm in a hurry. - Sit down! Please! Sir! With pleasure. - Why not? - How is he going to fit into this family? I filed a complaint against Vermeer. - I think I can keep the estate. - It doesn't matter anymore. I have good news and bad news. The good news is that my father will let you live... if you marry me. And the bad news is I have to kill a few people to prove myself worthy. No. Only one. Just go or you'll be late. - The young Van Zuylen de With. - Muller? - What are you doing here? - I live here. Are you sure? Won't you come in? Come. I have the estate back. And the cottage as well. You can move back. Thank you, but I've come to terms with the move. Take a seat. How've you been? Well. Quite well. And Miss De Koning? Very well. Please give her my warmest regards. I shall. I appreciate that talk we had. - It turned out to be very helpful. - It did? Yes. We should have done that more often. Have a chat. I'm sorry we never got around to it. - You're here now, aren't you? - Yes, I am. - A drink? - No, I'm fine. Don't bother. What's the matter? Nothing. You're ill, right? - I'll call a doctor. - I'm fit as a fiddle. Why do you want to die then? That's your plan, right? Jacob... - I had a very privileged life. - See, I knew it! And now I'm looking forward to being reunited... with Aline. But why now? I want to be with her. Do you believe in the afterlife? I only started thinking about it recently. And? I don't know what it looks like or whether it even exists. I can imagine that, if it did exist... If there really was such a thing... then I can imagine how that would be a great comfort. Sometimes I see her clearly before me. She's waiting for me. That's how I see it. I can almost touch her again. Hold her hand. Look into her eyes. Dance with her. Lie beside her. Lie beside her, until she tickles you to death. That's what you mean, right? Exactly. Jacob... You don't know how happy I am to hear you like this. If only your mother were here. This calls for a celebration. I've got good cigars in my kitchen. Would you fetch them? Hurry up. Life is short. - Can you see them? - No. I can't see them, Muller. Oh, wait... I've got them. Muller? He knew it. - He knew I was his Surprise. - No. When he came to us, he didn't choose the Surprise. He wanted to pass away in the company of a loved one. - Is it okay if we sit with him for a while? - Of course. I may have faith so great that I can move mountains. But if I lack love, I am nothing. You know what? Last week Muller said he'd miss me. Now it's the other way round. I miss him. Me... here. Can you believe it? You hear that, Muller? - He probably can't, right? - I think he can. Look, we may have a new client. One day you're on top and the next, you're nobody. That's quite a blow. You think he'll give us a call? If he does, he's all yours. Really? - How does that feel? - It feels good. We do good work.
