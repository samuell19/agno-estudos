Here in the Land of Fire, the mightiest of the Five Great Nations, lies the Hidden Leaf Village - home to many skilled Ninjas... Our story begins with a young knucklehead Ninja, who by a cruel twist of fate, carries the spirit of a Nine-tailed fox spirit within his body. Not one to be deterred the boy continues to train, seeking to become Hokage, the village's top Ninja. This is the story of Naruto Uzumaki... Awright! It's here, it's here, it's here!

Is anyone in there?! Can you hear me?! Anybody?! Anybody at all?! Hey! If anybody's in there, I'm beggin' ya to get out! It's occupied. Why'd it have to be Shino?! Wait your turn in the restroom... And keep it clean. Those are the rules. That's why I could never relate to this guy... - Please, just hurry it up, okay?! - Next is the relay race! - I don't think I can hold it any longer! - All competitors report immediately! Are you coming out?! Shino, please wrap it up quick! Now is the time to endure. What the--?! Hey! Are you crazy?! - Let go of me! C'mon, let go! - The relay is the last event of the day. Hey! Shino! You guys are in the lead, I can't just let you run off. - It's against the rules. - Please, I'm begging you! You idiot! This is why I never liked you! On your marks! Get set! Move it, Billboard Brow! Shut up, Ino-Pig! Sakura... C'mon, c'mon... I didn't think Choji could win with running anyway... Please, Sasuke, hurry... Damn Sasuke, what's taking you so long?! You loser. Get a move on already! What're you, trying to kill me? I think I'm reaching my limit here... If this goes on much longer, it's not gonna be pretty... Since it's come to this, I better finish this thing quick and run straight to bathroom. He's fast! Go, Naruto! What's gotten into him? I did it! Now I'm not stopping! Huh? Where are you going? I know it's a drag, but we still have the Awards Ceremony... You did it, Naruto! We get the paid vacation! Congratulations... Naruto... Well...that's it... I can't hold it anymore... - What'd you eat?! It stinks! - Holy Cow! What is that?! - No way! - Yuck! - N-Naruto, you...! - Someone! That's strong, even for him... Naruto! I'm so happy! With teeth clenched, he endures. (Gyu-ru-ru) With a forced smile, he endures That's the Naruto way of life. Stomaching it, swallowing it... And bearing down hard, he endures. Stretching tight, straightening his back... And casting a fleeting smile, he endures. But if it still doesn't work? Run at top speed! With teeth clenched, he endures. (Gyu-ru-ru) With a forced smile, he endures. That's the Ninja way of life. That's the Naruto way of life.
