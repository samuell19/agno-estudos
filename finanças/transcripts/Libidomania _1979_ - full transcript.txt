"And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man... And Adam said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.' She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother... and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh." And thus was sensuality born, and sexual desire. But when desire and invention intertwine, perversity ensues. The psychiatrist Krafft-Ebing wrote: A sexual impulse that defies nature is perverse... and will lead further in this direction. So each person should explore the reaches of his natural sexuality... and find fulfillment there. This film will attempt to illustrate sexual aberrations... help us to cure them and help to understand others that are prey to them. THIS FILM IS FREELY ADAPTED FROM: Krafft-Ebing refers in his work... to the sexual connotations in ceremonies practiced by primitive peoples. The spectrum of perversion is just as broad for fantasy knows no limits. When I meet a woman I feel absolutely no desire to sleep normally with her. I just want to subject myself to her. I only seek contact with the body parts that excite me. She must tread on me, no rush, for minutes on end. Tread on my chest, my stomach, my thighs, and finally my penis. I like having my throat stepped on, like she was strangling me with her foot. During my climax, I like her to block my sperm, first with the heel then the sole... to prolong my pleasure. Then something strange happens: I imagine that she's doing this to me to punish me because I treated her bad. Sometimes I get trodden on so hard I'm marked for days afterwards. This is Melinda, 24 years old. She lives in New York. Melinda is a so-called "transsexual". She accepts her condition and makes the most of it. Melinda either does it for free or she charges $50,000.00 a shot... explains her manager David Vogner. Who is this strange creature Melinda? A lot of men come after me. They never have a hang-up - quite the opposite. The fact I'm a she-man seems to be a big turn-on. A loaded Mexican paid $50,000.00 to sleep with me. What did we do? Just guess. Besides, I don't just play the passive homosexual role. Melinda, 24 years old, transsexual, a real hermaphrodite. She - or he - claims quite candidly to be happy... in her dual male/female personality. We are in the Onbangisciari tribal area of Guinea in Equatorial Africa. This man was caught in the act with the medicine man's wife. Adultery is punished in Guinea with the most brutal penalty: emasculation. Tokyo. Professor Shimada's team performs a sex-change operation. Thousands of individuals throughout the world... have recovered their true sexual identity through this treatment... and have become fit for loving. Singapore. A business-wise Japanese tradesman... has re-opened an old-established brothel for enterprising tourists... in which traditional sex fare is on the menu. For those seeking the sexual specialties of Asia... our host offers arrangements a la carte: Wild duck flying upside down, moaning monkey clinging to the tree... seasoned with love cries, tender slaps and love bites... and the dish of the day, a titbit, the red snapper: A palette of Asia's alt of love. Don't think the things we're showing you jumped out of a sci-fi writer's head. All of it goes on right around us... and more people are into it than you may think. One could say that sexual perversion is as old as Man himself. Otesia relates that Artaxerxes, the ruler of Babylon... liked dressing up in women's clothes. Helia wrote about the young Athenian who fell in love with the statue of Aphrodite: After embracing her ardently he would run around in a frenzy whilst aroused. Not to mention the myth of Narcissus... who fell in love with his own reflection in a mirror, and perished for it. To punish him for this frivolous iniquity, the gods turned him into a daffodil. And a second century chronicler describes how the philosopher Peregrinus Proteus... would masturbate in public, and then, as castigation, thrash his own bottom. From Greek mythology comes the legend of Pasiphae, who was smitten by a bull... and had him mount her whilst ensconced in a portable wooden cow. There are countless reports of necrophilia. Periander, a Corinthian king, ravished his wife Melissa after she expired. There were myriad practices in ancient times to prolong erections. There were expedients to repeat intercourse as often and as long as one wished. Recipes included paprika seeds... old wine spiced with ground herbs, allium onion, eggs and wild honey. Tigers' testicles were ingested in China 4000 years ago. Indian priests proposed the glans of sacrificial beasts to increase potency. Prosperous patriarchs in ancient Rome... sucked the breath from young maidens for invigoration. New Caledonia, Melanesia. These aborigines are preparing for a fertility ceremony that takes place each year. The fertility rite is a real marathon of love... an endurance contest that goes on for three days and three nights. On the eve of the festivities the participants... prepare themselves for their performances with copious bloodletting... convinced that this will increase both sexual prowess and endurance. Professor, when does human sexuality first manifest itself? I would say that it already occurs in the uterus... with the initial contact with the embryo's genitalia. No one today denies this exchange between mother and child. This reciprocal attachment is perhaps the most important contribution to life itself... and establishes the conditions for a future cohabitation and later sexual relationships. In this respect man and monkey have a lot in common... as Harlow's experiments demonstrated. A rhesus monkey was nurtured by its mother through a dummy... thus denying the offspring direct contact and natural affection. Character disorders and sexual irregularity in adulthood resulted. Taking this a step further we can examine our own sex life... which is basically a reproductive mechanism. This law of nature has its anatomical attribute, the development of our glands... which measure the sexual maturity of an individual. The time it takes to come to maturity, and the intensity... varies from person to person and community to community. It is one of mankind's most deep-rooted mysteries... and every individual must come to terms with his own maturity... though this can have tragic consequences for his sex life... if he harbors any illusions about it. Cognizance of the maturity of one's sexual awareness... in the exchange of giving and taking makes for the enrichment of life. Each individual must find this knowledge for himself. This is Kandisababa, a village in Papua. They believe a virgin is unclean - a sacrosanct belief amongst these people. The task of deflowering the village girls... is given to a neighboring tribe, the Okuboku, known as the Purifiers. They have just arrived to work on these curious and expectant maidens. Afterwards the girls will be handed over to the men of their own tribe... who are grateful and content. The ceremony takes place in a long house called "The Temple of Purification". The girls, the youngest are 8 years old, have picked their purifiers... and can't wait for the act that will make them women to be consummated - which will concurrently make cuckolds of their future husbands. An obsession with a particular part of a partner's body... All that turns me on is a woman's breasts and buttocks. Even if I just brush against them I have to get away and jerk off. As far as I'm concerned, breasts and asses are all super, even if they're a little flabby. Coitus was never a big deal, I never fancied it. It strikes me as a pointless waste of energy. When summer comes, I feel the pull of the French Riviera... where there's tits and ass all over. Professor Krafft-Ebing researched this form of sexual aberration exhaustively... and described it in great detail. The fetishist isn't interested if a woman is dressed or undressed. His sexual interest centers on a particular item of a woman's clothing. He believes he can possess the whole woman via this item. We call this psycho-pathology clothes fetishism. Body parts can also enter into this fetishism, not only genitalia: The hand, the foot, a part of the thigh and so on. Fetishism also includes sexual excitement through breast sucking... without any further sexual elucidation, which alone prompts an ejaculation. Another interesting manifestation elevates death to a fetish. I prefer not to reveal my name. I'm 32 and what the experts call a fetishist. I only turn on when I see a woman lying in a coffin. I pay a prostitute lots of money just to lie in my coffin and play dead. I strew her with lace and flowers. Myself I dress up as a priest or a kid off the street. The scent of incense makes me horny. I swear I never wanted to sleep with it. It never crossed my mind. You'll want to know why I don't look for real corpses instead of paying a whore. Well, I'd rather pick up a slut in a bar to do it, but that wouldn't work. They'd turn me in right away, and I'd probably end up in a mad house. And real dead bodies? No, too scaly. I need to work out my fantasy to get off. The scent of incense, the smell of the woman, my priest's rig... it all comes together to give me an incredible high, like I'm about to explode. And my coffin has a specially designed contraption for that. When those white buttocks loom up before my eyes... just a couple of seconds and I come and come! Another interesting aspect regards pseudo fetishes... where the fetish isn't a body part but a bodily disorder. Krafft-Ebing relates the case of Andreas H., 44... who finds excitement beholding women with pustules... pimples and other skin eruptions. The person is of no interest to him, it is the affliction that matters. Once alone, he only needs to conjure up these pustules and eczemas... to excite himself all over again. It can be excluded that he would ever sleep with these persons. Wagner chronicles a case of old-age fetishism. A patient, K.R., tells him in a psychiatric session... that he seeks sexual contact only with old women. He relates that his first sexual experience at age 17 was with an older lady... and he has since entertained no desire for anything less. Krafft-Ebing cites the case of V., age 30... who comes from a family suffering multiple disorders. She is highly neurotic. Since her 17th birthday she has only been attracted by men with bodily afflictions. The patient has no idea of the origin of her aberration... nor her morbid attraction to cripples. She is so excited by these individuals... that it doesn't matter to her if they are attractive or ugly. Another Krafft-Ebing case study concerns X., age 28, the daughter of disturbed parents. A girl with a neurotic, hypersensitive character. When she was 7, she was attached to a backward school friend. At 12, she was past puberty and had her first sexual experience with her friend. As a result of this experience she can only get satisfaction with handicapped partners. A man with her childhood friend's affliction became her fetish. A further Krafft-Ebing case study concerns P., age 25... who just yearns sex with hunchbacks. She feels an overwhelming desire for these individuals, who bring her to a powerful climax. The patient confesses she is lascivious... and only regrets that her sexual needs cannot be fulfilled. She had her first sexual relations at age 22 and since then only five further experiences. Were she to find a hunchback... she would marry him and make him a happy slouch. There are of course other variations on the fetish theme... and also combinations, for example together with sado-masochism. When I sense a crisis approaching I have a room prepared in a clinic. Then I put an ad in a men's magazine for an available couple. They have to be young and good-looking. They have to turn each other on but they mustn't touch one another. At the same time, I have to smother myself with cream... and I come 4 or 5 times in an hour. Let us consider another interesting case of fetishism. It doesn't centre on an object, but on the need to be bound in a particular situation. M.R. was found in an attic... suffocated with a plastic bag drawn over his head... whilst fettered by a painful and ingenious mesh of chains. M.S. committed suicide after appalling self-punishment... by shackling and constricting his arteries. B.Z. also hanged and castrated himself. He dressed in a garish woman's wig, ladies underwear... and a cassock open in the front. Krafft-Ebing coined the term "masochism"... after the famous Austrian writer Sacher-Masoch. As masochism, Krafft-Ebing defines sexual perversions... determined by a partner's particular sexual choice. Into this category falls the desire to humiliate, degrade and subjugate oneself. There follows the predilection for suffering and pain. The borderline between pain and pleasure is blurred and equivocal. Whenever I feel the urge I hole up in a flat I've specially rented. I call for three whores whom I've trained to treat me the way I want. It's always the same scene: the three girls take a bath together... the water gives the idea it's boiling hot. I make out I want to join them in the tub. I first ask them nicely, then I plead and finally threaten them. They mustn't give in to me, but beat me up instead... until I collapse on the bathroom floor. Then they climb out of the tub and walk over me. I want them to wipe their feet on my back like I was a bathmat. As soon as they've all left the tub I plunge my head into it... slurp the water and come to a climax, totally satisfied. Is it true that there is a fetish called pygmalionism... in which one has sex with statues and other icons? Even if many such sexual actions can be involved... one shouldn't forget that the concept is close to religious practices. Pygmalionism is an interesting phenomenon... even if less significant than other perversions. We know from antiquity of Sisyphus of Samos... who abused statues of goddesses investing their organs with flesh-like matter. This legend illustrates the fact that inventiveness will always find a path... to satisfy sexual desires. We gather that such usage is practiced even today amongst primitive peoples. North Cameroon. Our crew filmed modern pygmalionism. The natives celebrate Kaala, a fertility and conception fetish. They hope to reward themselves with countless children... and a bumper harvest from the parched fields. There are brothels that cater to this perversion. Certain prostitutes pose as statues for congruous customers. As a child I was deeply impressed by the story of Pygmalion... who fell in love with a statue that he himself had sculpted. Aphrodite took pity on the hopeless lover and brought his statue to life... so he could fulfill his desire. I go through this torture every Wednesday. For the first couple of hours he spreads plaster all over me... and as soon as it dries I can't move a muscle. Every Wednesday, when I visit my statue... I feel this excitement come all over me again, like it was the first time. The object of my deepest veneration is there before me... motionless and marvelously shaped, but unapproachable. It's always the same: he gets down on his knees... and spouts away for half an hour. I get a bit of cramp because I have to lie stock-still. How happily would I bind you with silk ribbons and entwine you with fragrant flowers... strew your body with jewels and make offerings to you. If all the punters I come across behaved like him, I'd quit tomorrow. When I've had my fill of her marble form, I'm overwhelmed by the desire to penetrate. There we go, there's beds everywhere in this establishment... but only this guy has to do it standing up! What is narcissism? A narcissist is someone who loves himself above all others... who is excited by his self-esteem and achieves sexual satisfaction... through the consummation of his amour-propre. It is a reciprocal love for oneself. Rohleder reports the following case: X., 35, is very successful in his work... but extremely repressed in the company of his colleagues. He displays no homosexual tendencies but shows no interest in women. He is tidy, well-groomed and smartly dressed. His favorite sight is of himself in a mirror, his hair is permanently wavy... he uses a lot of cologne and other cosmetics. I first started to love myself, body and soul, when I was 14... my thoughts, my ways, everything. I was so in love with myself that I kept kissing myself in a mirror... which often brought me to an orgasm. The sight of my penis so aroused me that it staid stiff after an ejaculation... without even touching it. Such cases of amour-propre are often associated with homosexuality... but do not presuppose it. Nor on the other hand is onanism necessarily a symptom of narcissism. I got more and more excited looking at my body in the mirror... I kissed myself and grasped my penis and began to masturbate. I loved this second self, which grew more and more real and physical. That's how I preserved my identity. Professor, how would you define autoeroticism? To understand it one must first of all recognize that onanism begins in early childhood. This means that even a baby has sexual perception... and this sexual awakening will be long remembered. In this phase playful mutual touching or mouth contact with genitalia is not abnormal. This comportment will disappear during development... only to return for brief or longer periods. It is a phase of sexual development. Self-gratification is an important stimulant that makes us aware of our own ascendancy. It shields us from risks and disappointments without having to forgo sexual satisfaction. Many newly wed women complain to sex therapists... that they only reach orgasm through masturbation. You can't imagine what comes out in these sessions. Krafft-Ebing, the renowned psychiatrist and forensic doctor in Austria and Germany... was of the opinion that masturbation not only led to perversion... but that it was the source of all dissolution. In Victorian times no measure was too drastic to condemn self-gratification. Women caught in the act had a hot iron pressed to their clitoris... and men were displayed in a cage studded with spiked nails... with their members exposed. There was torture, the scare of disease, the threat of hellfire... a general damnation of masturbation prevailed. Millions of masturbators fell prey to panic and despair. It is to Professor Havelock-Ellis' credit that this superstition was laid bare. European and American statistics reveal that 95% of all adolescents masturbate... so that one could well maintain that only the remaining 5% are aberrant. Are there different techniques of masturbation? Apart from manual means there are numerous aids for men and women. The market offers many gadgets from simple vibrators to high tech products. From France, for example, we have the "King-size Comforter"... a plastic penis with an electric drive that is introduced into the vagina. It takes over all the functions of a natural penis right up to the climax. Rubber dolls for men have replicas of all of a woman's attributes. The plastic woman can be filled with warm water... to give the illusion of body heat... and can be manipulated into any position the user wants. The intimate passage can be lubricated with oils or creams to make it slick... to simulate vaginal secretion. The artificial partner offers everything a man could desire for satisfactory intercourse. Women in Japan practiced an age-old method of masturbation... which is apparently very effective. It consists of two metal balls both about the size of a plum. One is hollow and the other is filled with quicksilver. The balls are slid into the vagina, the hollow one first. The movement of the hips causes the quicksilver filled ball... to push the hollow one upwards. The resulting vibration is sensational and an orgasm is guaranteed. This technique is called "Ben Wa". Where would you classify voyeurism, professor? Moll defined voyeurism as mixoscopia and classified it with masochism... as a sort of voluntary resolve to refrain from the active pursuit of pleasure. Voyeurs are often day-dreamers who may imagine sexual scenarios... that go well beyond anything conceivable. I went down to this cellar so I could look up women's skirts. A very good place to do it from. Up above there's the shop window of a boutique. The women stand there looking at the display. When I see one without panties I come in two seconds flat. I'm sometimes there for hours on end. Once the postman caught me. He thought I was a burglar and called the law. I told them everything, so as not to go inside... but they put my name on their list of Peeping Toms. I've got three kids but my old lady doesn't turn me on any more - with her I'm impotent. What really turns me on is a couple fucking. I prowl parks and parking lots looking for them. Then I wank myself silly watching. We also believe that exhibitionism is a perversion. Flashing my penis is a great passion of mine. I like showing it to very young girls or older ladies and I enjoy shocking them. Of course I don't want anything else from them... the main thing is they get a good look. When I'm back home, I go over it all again in my mind... masturbating with a vibrator. As a child I was always told what a lovely body I had. Later on they said I had breasts like marble. I loved my body and never let any man get his hands on me... to preserve its beauty. Sometimes I run around naked with my window open... knowing that men are watching me from outside. I've decided to have a plaster cast of my bosom made... so I can send my admirers a copy. From voyeurism to exhibitionism we come to troilism. It is the departure point for group sex, what is called a sex orgy. Clearly, these encounters don't only involve hetero- but also homosexual activities. Don't think that troilism is so unusual. It occurs in all strata of society, not just the sex saturated top ten thousand. Love is a many splendored thing. I always dreamt of a threesome. It gets boring with just one chick in the long run. When I'm lying in bed with two birds I feel so good like I was back in my mother's womb. And when the two of them get dikey, I go potty. Wild! Oh, man do I get a hard-on! I find it so groovy, lying in bed with a girlfriend... and suddenly feeling a guy there too. Anyway, what's the big deal? What's your opinion of beauty contests? Covert aberrations can surface in these contests. At such events very interesting attitudes can be observed... that can border on the perverse. One must attribute to the spectator a mixture of voyeurism and fetishism... confronted by the exhibitionistic and narcissistic behaviour of the entrants. To sum up, let's say the male fetishist fails to see the woman... the female fetishist the man and both forget humanity. We understand sadism as sexual pleasure derived from abuse... maltreatment and cruelty towards people and animals. The personal gain of pleasure through pain and suffering of others, is its basis. The term "sadism" comes from the 18th century French author Marquis De Sade... who wrote books involving sadistic practises. Sadists risk conflict with society and the law. To inflict pain and humility on others... can put one outside the borders of socially acceptable conduct. Nevertheless, sadism is a red thread running through the tapestry of mankind. Cruelty was an outlet, in the hunt, trial by ordeal... the treatment of slaves or public executions. Let's listen to the famous Marquis de Sade himself: To pursuant of pleasure, of every age and gender, I dedicate my work. Take my lessons to heart, befitting your most intimate desire. These passions tell you apart from dull and wintry moralists... even when they paint you in the darkest of colours. Very nature has installed you with these wishes. Do not heed the moralists... your passions alone will lead you to true happiness. Shameless women, follow libidinous Serjeance... and reject God's laws that hem your lust and try to rule your lives. De Sade's conception may be logical but isn't practicable in this world. Nevertheless, sadism flickers through to our daily life irrespective of our education... for why else would laws exist to punish cruelty and violence. Let's listen to De Sade speak again: Maidens, bound by the illusion of virtue and the tastelessness of religion... imitate the blazing Eugenie. Fight back with resolution and stamp on the feet of incompetent elders. Unbridled lovers... don't let youth restrain your feelings nor dictate your very needs. Let cynical Dolmence be your guide... when you step out on the glowing road to immorality. Let us look at that most horrendous form of sadism... that Krafft-Ebing termed the ultimate perversion, the sex murder. It's stronger than me. It's not my fault, when I squeeze the last breath out of a woman's body. It drives me crazy. It's like a bloody mist in front of my eyes. Die, die, you bloody slut! Most sex killings are by strangulation, without recourse to weapons. The sex murder is the most miserable, gruesome sexual perversity. Along with drug addiction it has increased in frequency. Aphrodisiacs, formulas to increase sexual duration and potency... are named after the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. These products have been concocted from seeds and roots... since the dawn of time and increased performance has always been a must. If you ask me if they're effective I must simply answer no. In most cases they consist of extracts, roots, hormones and drugs... but also stimulating literature - all means to enable man to realise an imaginary dream. Some of these means are fraught with danger... whose effects are only evident later and lead to self-deception and a loss of reality. The use and misuse of aphrodisiacs... from harmless household remedies to dangerous drugs... has a long and continuing history. Meanwhile, the sex therapist in his white smock and sterile surgery... has taken over from witches and sorcerers. I was totally frigid. LSD helped me become a woman. It sparked off my evolution and made me experience totally new things. A man could satisfy me at last or I could do it alone. Only the drug can help a person like me to find my inner self. I couldn't live without acid. It helps you... but it can be lethal. This is Bamana territory in Central Africa. A centuries old ritual combining sex and magic is performed here. The Niagas are powerful spirits, who come from afar... to rob the village girls of their virginity. The Bamanas believe the Niagas are invulnerable... because if they are threatened they will retreat into the hereafter. The ritual symbolises the struggle between life and death. The spirits have come to deflower a maiden. Naturally, the village witch doctor benefits most from this custom. Demons, sex shamans, evil spirits, male and female... sexual encounters with the dead... belong to the Middle Ages yet they are still present in modern times. Many sects have been founded in America and Europe... devoting themselves to black magic and secret rituals. These groups are generally peaceful... but sometimes in the course of their ceremonies... they desecrate graves and torture innocent people. These sects have a leader, a sort of high priest... who has absolute power over his followers. Omnipotent, he demands total submission, which will happily be offered to him... as self-abnegation is a precondition of acceptance in the sect. The leader of the sect radiates magnetic strength. He has a strong, though negative, personality and is a sexual psychopath... which may help explain his disciples' dependence and their apathy. Any sexual conduct is allowed the members of this sect of Satan. The principal ceremony at their gathering is the reversing of holy mass in blasphemy. An endless succession of atrocities and perversion follows. However one looks at it, this performance doesn't just offend our sensibility. These are simply criminals at loose giving free reign to their carnal cravings. These obscenities and sexual frolics are examples of pathological behaviourism. The term "coprophilia" denotes the erotic desire... that is appeased by the sight or contact with excrement. "Coprophagy" is the eating or drinking thereof as sexual arousal. Such cases are not rare and ever more frequent. All bodily excretions are palatable: phlegm, earwax and human feces. Cantanaro reports a case where the male could only complete coitus... when he bit, licked and sucked his partner... but only on the condition she neither washed nor bathed. I'm only interested in a woman's pubic hair. When I pull it out with my teeth, I go crazy. That's the only way I come. Sometimes I pay the hotel staff to let me into beds in the morning... where women have slept so I can look for their pubic hair. I was totally inexperienced when I married... and my husband was much older. On our first night he had me sit astride him and pee into a goblet. I left him the next day and went back to my parents. I've finally discovered what gives me satisfaction: When my wife sits on my chest and vacates her bowels on my body. That's the only way I get a hard-on. I spend a lot of time in bars, restaurants and parks. When I see a woman go to the bathroom I follow her. If she disappears into the toilet I pretend to wash my hands. Then I peep through the keyhole to watch her doing her business. A particular kind of coprophage is the "renifleur" or "sniffier". He is gratified by the odour of excrement. Public lavatories hold a particular appeal for him. As soon as she leaves the lavatory, I run in and smell the toilet bowl... imagining the most beautiful women in the world and I come. Eating someone from one's own tribe... has a transcendental significance in some native societies... and they use the same word for coitus. Cannibalism is only exceptionally permitted or requested... as it represents the magic of reconciliation. In addition all the members of a tribe together form a unifying entity or single organism. For this reason on the death of the chief... they must all smear themselves with the secretion seeping from his decaying corpse... to strengthen their common bond with him. To demonstrate the interaction between cannibalism or autophagy and sexuality... I will cite an example from New Guinea. It was reported that a grave had been found desecrated. A woman accompanied by relatives had appeared... and eaten the flesh of her dead brother. Although ritual cannibalism was permitted... she had shocked the clan members... by breaking the rules... for by consuming the corpse she had wanted to possess the deceased. To partake of the flesh of one's own clan in order to bond with him... counted as an outrageous violation of clan customs, comparable to incest. At this point we should return to a very rare perversion - necrophilia. This sort of corpse robbery... must be classified apart in the order of sexual psychopathology... as does Krafft-Ebing. Herodotus reports that in ancient Egypt a distinguished widower... wouldn't bring his deceased wife directly to the embalmers - especially if she was young and beautiful. The law prescribed that a corpse should be delivered only three days after the demise... to prevent the crude embalmers from taking advantage of it. A wise law that took into account the deplorable state of affairs. Nevertheless, Herodus relates, an embalmer was caught... amusing himself with a woman's warm corpse. His colleagues reported him to the council of priests. As a child I had this terrible compulsion to destroy anything I got hold of. When I was 13 I wanted to have all women sexually... and I masturbated whenever I had a chance. I imagined myself in the same room with lots of women screwing them... and beating them up. They seemed nothing more than living dead and I could do what I wanted to them. This fantasy gradually got more and more compelling. Since I couldn't get hold of a dead woman I made do with dead animals... which I carved up and tore apart in a mad frenzy. After that I had just one longing: to get hold of a woman's corpse. I was terribly afraid at first but when I found a freshly dug grave... I went out of control. Excitement overwhelmed me and I nearly passed out. I could hardly keep my balance. I felt like a hunter who'd caught his prey when I saw the coffin. When I got the lid off I caught sight of a beautiful body. I had just one desire: to possess her. In this case we clearly see strong sadistic traits in the necrophiliac. Alternatively - one must treat each case separately - the corpse can be viewed as a fetish. I spent a quarter of an hour cutting her up... and I got more and more frenzied as I tore her innards out. It was even crazier than the intercourse. Sexual relations between man and beast- not to be confused with a love of animals - is called sodomy. Can you elaborate on this, professor? Whilst people today consider sexual relations with animals aberrant and unacceptable... it wasn't always so... as Egyptian and Indian mythology testify. Zoophilia is possibly quite common in China. In Africa and the Orient, erotic exchanges with animals aren't so covert as in the West. They are tolerated and not criminalized. Healing powers and magical tutelage are often attributed to them. Professor, can an unhealthy and excessive love of animals lead to sodomy... particularly amongst uninhibited subjects? Of course there are people who do feel sexual attraction to animals... and have lost all their inhibitions. I call them degenerates. They seek to fulfill their desires in this or any other way. Krafft-Ebing called this activity "zooerasty". Nothing went on between me and my husband anymore. Whenever I got close to him he used an excuse like he was too tired or overworked. One day he told me he didn't feel anything for me like that anymore. But if I found something else that turned him on we could stay together. I said okay because I didn't want to lose him. This case is related by Sun. B. is 27 years old and mother of eight. Her husband requires her to couple frequently with a sheepdog. The stimulating factor, as we found out, is not the animal itself... but the singularity of this sexual act. Coitus occurred twice after the woman went on all fours. Mr. B. declares it began as simple curiosity, to procure pleasure for his wife. The couple's doctor testifies to the truth of the story: Mrs. B had to take her clothes off in front of the dog. Mrs. B got down on all fours... and the dog promptly approached her to consummate coitus with her. Professor, Krafft-Ebing speaks of erotic zoophilia. Zoophilia is described as a situation... in which an animal exercises a strong force of attraction over a person. I never reached a climax with a man. I thought I was frigid. Then one day when I climbed on a horse... I felt an incredibly pleasant sensation, like I'd never felt before. Two weeks later the same thing happened on a horse, only this time I had an orgasm. I was frightened at first and upset but I quickly got accustomed to it. I dreamed only of horses. My orgasms got more and more intense when I saw a stallion mount a mare. I just flipped out, I nearly went crazy. Coitus is most fulfilling now when I do it in a stall... specially with lots of horses there. Couldn't one also define this as voyeurism? Absolutely, since zoophilia is a perversion common to hypersensitive subjects. That is why it is also coherent that a subject with an overactive libido... is affected by a sort of rapture. There is a variety of combinations regarding deviations in sexual behaviour. Ethnology demonstrates that homosexuality, transvestism and oral sex... are judged differently by different cultures. They are either tolerated or criminalized as perversions. In no other area of life is tolerance so fundamental as in the sexual sphere... which doesn't mean that sexual of fences can be justified or excused. But it leads us to consider our view of marriage, faithfulness, virginity... as terms of reference that let us separate merits from demerits. Intolerance harbours the danger that anything that doesn't conform to set standards... will be considered perverse, the non-conformist judged aberrant. How readily we call our neighbour a satyr or his wife a nymphomaniac... but are we fully aware of the meaning of these terms? Such biased behaviour often betrays a defect in the sexual conduct of the beholder. Intolerance has a lot in common with falsity. Like a worm within a fruit it bores into the soul... and corrupts the mind of a healthy person. A Chinese sage, contemplating the magic power of sex 2000 years ago, pronounced: The meeting of the sexes can only be compared... to the encounter with the cosmos. We wish to experience this encounter as humans... in a universe that is our own. THE END
