Hello? Mr. Thorn? Just three packages? A few have been missing around here. So I'm taking three and leaving two. Good? Thanks. How much longer do you have there? It's different than last time. No, it's not. Have you transferred the house into your name? Jonathan, Richard has been nice enough to set that all up- He's a lawyer, you pay him. He's always done more than he needs to for us. Sure, he charges appropriately. Hey, they shut down the plant. That's good news. I mean it's pathetic. Dad's death wasn't enough, it took another hundred and fifty three, but- - They didn't know anything when we worked there... - No, mom, they lied to you. You make excuses for everyone. Well, you make excuses for not visiting me. We're seeing each other right now. We don't have to talk. Just come here and... and hold my hand. I missed you. A man was hit by a car six blocks away. Another was shot. It's not risky to just go out... Have you improved since you left? - Well, that's different. - It's not. You never should have left. - Jonathan, you would be safe here. - You would be safe here. - Honey, we're gonna be okay... - I gotta go. Honey... Yes? Thanks for the note, it was great. But it says take five. There's only three. There are five. Really? There's only three here. It's not right. Are you talking to him? Fucking can he see us? Yeah. Thank you for your business. We love serving you over the years. Ah, we have some great specials I'd like to tell you about. - Which boxes are there? - Well, it's Tuesday, so it's noodles. - Not you, him. Which boxes are missing? - Oh, not sure. Come out here and check, then I can take these. - And I thank you personally. - I don't need thanks. I need the boxes there. They are not here. They might have been taken. Please go. They'll all be late. Be on time tomorrow. Nothing changes. I think he has prisoners in the basement. That's what the food is for. What do you think? I'm calling the police. What? I didn't do shit. Leave. I don't have anything you want. You don't even know what I want. Twenty-three million Americans have their packages stolen every year, you're not original. Wrong. I'm here to collect donations for the whales. Now you're lying. I'm not lying. Whales are in danger and shit. So, you wanna donate? No. You're a thief and a liar and I want nothing to do with you. Okay, that's just fucking rude. What did the whales ever do to you, huh? I'm not giving you my money. Yo, what's with your windows? Sun exposure causes cancer. So sun is your biggest concern. Okay. Okay. So, so I'm collecting donations to make the sun dimmer. You wanna donate? Fuck. Go! - Hey, what's going on here? - None of your business, Sir. Walk away. - Hey, I don't think you're supposed to be here. - Fuck off! Oh, shit. - You're fucking laughing? - Yeah, we gotta go. No. Fuck, you fucking can't... you just can't leave him! Yeah. Think about your daughter, ...fucking trial. Please open the door. Open the door. Open. Please, open the door. Please. Please. Two seconds till I leave your ass here. So fucking leave! - What is wrong with you? - Please. Who gives a shit about this asshole? Don't fucking leave me out here! Open this door! You're gonna fucking call the cops, huh? You were out here, too! Don't fucking call the cops. Oh, you fucking kidding me? This is your fucking fault. We wouldn't even be doing this shit if it wasn't for you. Fuck it. Hello? He's gone. You can leave now. - You recorded everything? - It's only live. So what are you gonna do? You're gonna say it was us? It wasn't you. Are you gonna tell? It's not my place, I'm not involved. Then I guess you weren't. Why is there plastic everywhere? It's something crazy people do. Are you crazy? Viruses and bacteria are eighteen nanometers, this blocks them. They're gonna want to talk to you. I'm not going out there. What? This is your house, you just- just tell them you didn't see anything and they'll go away. Hey, good afternoon. Officer Heather Cain. Do you know what happened out here? Can you open the door just a little bit more please? So, you don't know anything? No. - Do you own this home? - My mother does. Is there anyone else here? Alrighty then, we're gonna need to take you in to get a proper statement. - I don't know anything. - Well, you're a special witness. No, you can't. No probable cause. You're a material witness. This is harassment. We can pull you if we need to. I do not leave this house. This is not me. - I do not leave this house. - I need assistance up here! - You are leaving today, Sir. - No, it's not me. - I do not leave this house. - Alright, calm down. I can wait here all day. Froze up again. I got it. Hey, there. So you know nothing about what happened? Then what are you doing here? You're just wrong place wrong time. But to have large bruises on his chest and that makes me think that this was a crime and then you're refusing to talk to me and that raises another. So why won't you talk to me? Let me call someone. Oh, no, you're not under arrest. No. You're a material witness. You just answer my questions and then you can go. Do you know how many unsolved deaths I see every day? Just answer a few questions. Large bruises on his chest. That raises a flag. Under arrest. Why won't you talk to me? Alright, give me a chance at solving this, alright? Was it an accident? So just tell me what you know. I haven't left that house in two years. - Whatever happens outside has nothing to do with me? - So this is your excuse. - It's the truth. - No, you're using it as an excuse not to talk to me. I just don't know anything. Then how is a lawyer gonna help? Because you want an answer any way possible. So if your injustice goes hand in hand with unsolved crime, just because you don't have an answer doesn't mean I have anything to do with it. Oh. Give him the phone. You can use mine. Thank you. You weren't involved? They said it might have been an accident. Why'd you call me if you have nothing to say? It happened outside, I'm not involved. I know you weren't out there but did you see something? Maybe on the door camera? He didn't ring the doorbell. He? I don't know they, she, it was a clown that killed him. Jonathan, this is serious. He had a life. He had a family. They deserve to know what happened. I don't know. I don't know him. I don't know anyone. I haven't done anything wrong. I thought you of all people could explain that to them and help get me home. Right and wrong. I don't deserve this. I'm not involved. I told your mother I was coming here. It's just gonna worry her and make her worse. Let's go visit her. Please, not today. Come on, you're already out. - She's not looking too great. - I know. I already watched my father disintegrate. She just wants to see her son. How is me watching her die going to help? I'm the one that has to live with that. I'm ready to be alone. Is that really how you feel? I'll go see her, just not today. I need to get home. Go give me your statement. Glad you called me. No man is an island. It's okay to rely on somebody else. Even if you try everything, you do affect someone else. It's normal to be scared for your mom. Are you listening? Jonathan. What do you do? What do you mean? How do you make money? I... I sell things. I sell things, too. You know we both are entrepreneurs. How great. This incident that happened out here, it was an accident. An unfortunate occurrence. I think it's better for both of us we just forget about it, right? - Trying to. - Good. Town, on the other hand, leaving me like that, opening that door, coming in here, that's different. Good luck in your business. Mom, I... Jonathan Thorn? Yes. I have terrible news to inform you. Your mother... As you know, I've met with some of the other people from the plant, uh, might be able to help. Are they accepting the blame? No, they won't do that. Blends into... Son, don't let them do it to you. Ah! Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan! Thanks for doing that. You can just leave them out there. I didn't get her ashes. We go together. I can't go to a hospital. Do you know how many hospital-associated infections happen every day? You're already acclimated. Come on, Jonathan, we gotta go. How did this happen? It was just the money. What does that mean? You saw my mother as a lonely lady with a settlement check. That is not true. It was the money. That's all people like you ever want. I never accepted a fee. You never made it easy on her. I did everything I could to help because nobody else would. Come on. Come with me. - I can't... - You're gonna regret not going. ...leave this house. You don't understand. Somebody is out there. There's nobody here. You're scared of nothing. I'm not going without you. You can't just leave her there. You already did. You made that choice. You said you didn't want to watch her die and you didn't. I saw her every day. Do you think this is a conversation? Sorry, you're gonna have to take care of it yourself. It's what your mom would have wanted. Yo. What are you doing? Come on man, you gotta get up. Grab. Can you go to the hospital and get my mother's ashes? Uh... I could... I could give you a ride, but then we're even. I can't. Why not? He's not gonna find us there. Here. Hey, it solves one of your problems. You can't keep those. Let's go. What? I don't have key. Nobody's gonna steal your fucking plastic. Come on. So, not close with your mom? We were closer when I was younger. Well, yeah, that makes sense. I mean that's the only person you actually know for like the first eight years of your life. And then you figure out they are a douchebag just like everybody else. That's mean. My mom wasn't that bad, she just only thought about herself, which is fine, she just shouldn't have had kids. Then you wouldn't be alive. Yeah, well, mistakes happen. Now I figured out she didn't want me there, so I got out. How old were you? Sixteen. I had Benny, so it's not like I was alone. Same guy? Yep. He's actually very charming when he's not fucking up your life. Take your time, but there are some things we need to discuss. I understand that. Some mute, some take a while to get talking. So, this is Thomas Grant. Annabelle Thorn. Oh, yeah, right. Annabelle, 1138. Sorry. Go ahead, Miss, whenever you're ready, I am here. And how will you be paying? - Us? - Yes. Payment. What am I paying for? It's the medical certificate claiming death, the post-mortem exam, embalmment, cremation services. You embalm before you cremate? State, city, county taxes, hospital fees. I could sit here and come up with all the answers you need but I'm busy, you're busy, let's get through this. Not my fault. Here. - What are these? - For you. - For what? - Grief, depression. - I don't need this. - Don't worry about it, freebies, not on the bill. - I'm fine. - You don't look fine. No problem. And, yes, you do need to accept and sign for them in person or in the same hospital. I'm sure you've been here before. This is ridiculous. Yes, it's checked here that she went peacefully in the night. Yes, her soul did transition into the afterlife very nicely at 10:57 p.m. , so the official time of death is 11:45. We did have some doctors come in and check and she was promptly cremated afterwards. No, I am so sorry I cannot answer that question over the phone. You're gonna have to come in if you want that information. - Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm. - Okay, we are all set. One moment, please. Great. And I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. and Mrs. Grant. Go ahead, Ma'am. I know it's tough. Yes, grief is part of the process. We just stole. You can't steal your own mother. Besides, that guy's not gonna remember who you are or what happened. He will remember. There were cameras. We're going to get caught. Don't you pride yourself on living your life off the grid? Like your house is still connected to water and power and you use delivery people for your bidding. But like your own weird little world separate from the society, nonetheless. Fuck that guy. I want to go home. Mm. It's big a noper. You owe me one. I've got things to do. Dude, you suck at lying. Don't do it. Go up to the door, say you're there to see Sarah. - Who's Sarah? - My daughter. The less you say, the more believable it will be. Like, feels like you work for the government and don't give a shit like that fucking sloper back there. You have a daughter? See if her father's been by. - Can you take a picture? - I don't have a camera. Use your phone. You don't have a phone? No one to call. You're a fucking whack job. Here, use mine. Oh, and give her this. Give her that from me. Hey! What do you want? Uh, I'm here to see Sarah. Month review, you're early. Place is messy, I'm sorry. I'd have remembered a cutie like you. You got ID for me? I can sit here and come up with all the answers you need but I'm busy, you're busy. Let's get through this. - It's not my fault. - Fine. That's fine. Hey, you heard anything about payment? - I still haven't got any checks on her. - No. It was worth a shot. Sarah! ...she's not allowed to have hers. Her mother was a real piece of work being a danger and at all. Sarah just shut herself off from the world because of it. Poor little thing. - Well, you're gonna ask him questions? - Am I going home? Not you sweetheart, him. - Where is home? - With my mom and sometimes my dad. We live downtown. - Can I go? - Maybe next time. Has your father come to see you? They don't know where I live. They lost their right to see a sweet little girl like you. Hey, turn up your brightness. When the game goes to night, it really helps. - Thanks. - Alright, that's enough game time. You got two minutes. Can I take your picture? Sure. That's my mom's phone. Is she your friend? Yeah, we're friends. Does she miss me? She does. Then why isn't she's spending time with me anymore? - Did I do something? - No. She wants to see you really. She sent me to check on you. But that's not the same. Don't you want to be in it? Give that to my mom. Don't look at me, get in. Drive, you idiot. I don't know how. Okay, put the keys in the ignition. The long vertical pedal is to go forward, the other one is to stop. Okay, put your foot on the brake and then pull that lever in the middle until the D lights up. - Now what? - Take your foot off the fucking brake. Gently, gently, put your foot down on the... the other pedal there. Yep, circle around, circle around. You got to put your fucking seatbelt on, man. This isn't so hard. No. Most people can do it. - Do you want to take over? - No, you're good. Just read the signs and do what they say. - You got my phone, man? - Yeah. How long has she been there? They took her three weeks ago. That bitch gets paid to take her and I have to steal to pay for a lawyer. I'm gonna get her back though. I'm sure that will make her happy. It's better than there. I'm gonna make a beautiful home for her someday and she'll forget any of this ever happened. What about her? I don't really know much about her. All she did was work. I think I could have done more to help her. Well, can't blame yourself for what she didn't do with her life, right? Anyway, funerals are for the living. She's fucking dead. Did you not realize that? Whoa, you can't just stop in the middle of the street. Hey! He's just learning, asshole! Fuck! Come on, driving lesson is over. Come on. Look, I'm sorry, I'll help you, okay? But we got to get out of here. Let's go. It's okay, you did good. How about over there? Hey, you do some of this. I thought it would be more. That's all. Everything you are, gone in the shake of a bag. Or a kick down the stairs. You don't talk about that. - I can't... - Stop it. - I've known his family. - Stop it. Stop it. It was an accident. Was it? I didn't want fucking Benny there. I was trying to do the shit on my own. He found out that Sarah had been taken and I freaked out. I don't know. Why did they take her? Because of him. He's like hammered, right? And screaming about something and our lovely neighbor calls the cops. They show up. Of course, he's long gone, but they see Sarah, they claim it's unsafe. So they take her. And I can't afford a lawyer, so I can't get her back. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, I'm sorry doesn't make anything better, right? Like, I am sorry about your mom. It doesn't make you feel any better, does it? Benny is always there because of me. The delivery guy wouldn't have been there if it wasn't for me. I guess we're in the same boat, the same fucking pond and all we can do is shut up about it, hold on together. Thanks for making me do this. Thanks for checking in on Sarah. I needed that. So I guess we both got something out of today. - Where are you going? - That part's over. Kitchen? Wait. What are you doing? Oh! Just add water. You do have that, right? You need food. You're gonna feel sad and shitty for a few days and I'm not gonna be around, so you can have a brownie and you'll feel better. Now it's a party. Oh! That's awful. There you go. That'll make you feel better. I feel fine. Come on, man, everybody's sad when someone dies. I am seriously sad that she's dead and I didn't even know her. Doesn't suck, right? Just swallow any of that or just rub it on your teeth? What the fuck? I put up the plastic for her but she didn't want it in here. You can't keep the whole world out. You can. I made it through. So, this was your mom? Can I show you something? Why do you watch this crap? I imagine I was there. It seems simpler back then. Easier to be happy. What you're watching is the delusion of happiness. These people had shitty days. They just didn't film them. So this is what you do all day? It bothers you the way I live. You seem like a good person. Feels like a waste. I just don't fit any place else. You'd have to leave here to try. I tried. I once tried to go to high school. And the first day I worked up just enough courage to introduce myself to a girl. Prettier than me? She said, "I only talk to guys with scars. Show me your scars." I didn't have any, so I ran away to her friends giggling at me. In the art room I found an X-Acto knife. I ran it across my arm but it went too deep, jerked it and I hit a vein. Suddenly there's blood everywhere. I had never felt pain like that. And I collapsed. Next thing I knew I was in the hospital and I had my scars. You know what happened when I went back? They laughed at me. I was trying to be someone I'm not. This is who I am. This is where I belong. Okay, so the quiet, creepy guy works up the nerve to approach a girl and she's expected to throw herself at him? And then when she doesn't, he fucking cuts his arm off. God, you're lucky they only laughed, you psycho. Okay, no, no, no, no, no, don't get all emo on me, run off to your mom's room again. Are you laughing? You're right. I know. Okay, get up. I'm tired of your sad stories and your unrelated relatives. This is you, right? Here. Okay. Alright. Okay, come on, let's go, let's dance. - What are you doing? - Waltz box step. I'm still learning. Who taught you that? Internet. Reason number one my world does not, it's cracked up to be. Come here. Come here. Okay, come on. Ready? And one, two. One, two, three, one, two, three. One, two. One, two. What? The world feels less scary in here. I like not feeling afraid. What was that? I know you are in there. I'd say go around, we'll run to my car. No, no, we stay here, it'll be safe here. - You can get... - Please, please don't you let him in. Come on. I was just doing it to protect us. Now we're family. I love you lots. To be together is right. I love you lots. Let's work it out together and I'll get Sarah back and start over. I need you. You need us. You know it. Let's get her back. Let's go get her. Let's go get our daughter. Benny, stop it! It's over! I'll make sure he doesn't bother you. You don't have to worry. What about you? I'm sorry I stole your packages. I'm not. Everybody makes mistakes. Takes guts to admit your own. Don't worry, they're not gonna be mad. All right, let me get this straight. You withheld crucial evidence which may be too late to be of any help and you've got a condition for meeting you said. I didn't want to be involved. Bullshit. - You're hiding something. - I'm not. Jonathan felt he was at risk coming forward with this. Tampering with evidence. He'll know this came from my house and come after me. Then why do this now? I'm sure the victim's family wants to know what happened. I hope this helps. Well, I doubt very much they want to know that he was kicked down the stairs for some petty theft. That'll make them feel great. I can't change what happened. Look, is this what happened? Yes, it is. Well, why should I trust you? Put my name on it if it makes you feel any better. I'll vouch for him. When new evidence like this comes in, normally, it's fake. You know, maybe throw us off. Is that what's happening here? We're getting too close? If you are getting close, this should confirm that it's him. If you thought it was someone else, you would be wrong. Was there anyone else with him? No, he did it alone. These are two big steps for you. Your mom would be proud. I think I'm gonna walk home after. Fantastic. Good for you. Get out in the world. If you get tired, call me, I'll come pick you up. Please, sit. Did you know him well? Not well enough. - Are you his mother? - Oh, no. No, I own this place. I... I don't like people who are here to feel alone. There are worse things than being alone. I've never figured out what that is. I couldn't go in. It seemed easy for you. Are you okay? Why wouldn't I be? Get in. Cops fucked up the apartment good. - How did they know it was him? - I don't know. Not if they got him they'll get me. Fuck! Oh, my God! - What? - Nothing. Say whatever the fuck you're thinking, Jonathan. Just thinking of a way to help. What, like going to live in your bubble? I don't live in a bubble. - If you don't know that already, I can't help. - I don't. Look at this. Right there, that's your fucked up house. Look how much is out here and you choose only that. - I don't need anything else. - You don't get anything else. I just live the way I want. Why waste the time if you're not doing anything? Why don't just get it over with? Say fuck it and kill yourself? Benny is your own fault. I didn't fuck up your life. - Excuse me? - You did. You know what he does. - You don't know. - You like playing the victim sitting back and saying, "I didn't have a choice, I'm trapped." It's easy to blame everything wrong on him, that way you don't have to blame yourself. He's your box. You don't know how to live without him. How's your life going without your mother looking after you? At least I'm trying. So I fucked up. Just let me help you. Fuck you! You think you can just swoop in here and save me? You think I haven't been through this before? This is what I do! You and your scared little existence isn't gonna help me. I turned him in. They're not coming after you. It was the right thing to do. Well, you did it. Think it's gonna be easy for me to get Sarah back now that her father's in jail for murder? I wasn't protecting him. Or me. Get in the car. Don't say anything, just get in the car. At least let me help you get Sarah back. I can set you up with a lawyer. Why are you doing this? I thought I had learned everything that life had to teach me. The line of my life had curled itself around in a circle. Everything was the same again and again. I mean nothing to no one, which is what I thought I wanted until Sarah and you reminded me of what I was missing. She needs you. She can have a great life. And I can't bear the thought of her being in that place knowing that I could do something about it. Come in. Oh! Hello. Hi. Come in. We want to put all this behind us, start fresh. Sarah is a wonderful little girl. I haven't done anything wrong. Everyone is just after me for what he did, you know. Do you ever feel like that? Sure. So with him out of the picture there's no problem. - He's the one in jail? - Yeah. You have a former prier? Yes. But I've fulfilled all of my requirements. So this is a new start. Jonathan's helping me. He's a great guy. I see. - What are you doing? - I'm helping her. Why are you involved? You don't know them. You helped my mother when no one else would. How long did it take you to trust her? - This is different. - It's not. She needs help. Please. All right, keep a little distance. I'll see what I could find. Thank you. Be careful. Of course. Damn it. - You actually have to... - No, no, no, no, I got it, I got it, I got it. Boom. Boom. Boom. Whoa. How? Hey, you know what Benny said when we arrested him? You did it. He said you didn't know him. I don't know him. Well, he knows you. - New car? - What? Yours? No. That's interesting. Look there. same car. Do you know Town Munroe? That's who the car was last registered to a few years back. Town Munroe was arrested before associated with Benny. And now I find her car here again. - Is she here? - Well... No. Did she do something? Don't cover for her. You don't need that. You don't have any idea what you're dealing with here. She's not here. Well, your association with her makes your new evidence kind of weak. So you're gonna have to help. You gotta tell me what really happened. I already told you. All right. Well, we let Benny go 'cause we didn't have enough to hold him any longer. Oh, and I'm issuing a warrant for Town Monroe. You let her know if you see her. Looks better if she turns herself in. You heard? Baby, we gotta go now. They are coming for you. I'm gonna go get Sarah and then I'm gonna get you. Pick up! - Does he know where she is? - I didn't tell him. - Who does? - Child Services? Richard? Hello? There's been an accident. He knows where she is. Sorry. Fucking... He always has to go too fucking far! - What's he doing? - I don't know. We have to go. We have to get to her before he does. Come on. No, no, no. Town! Town, Town, stop! You're not gonna help anyone, you're gonna get hurt. Town, I can't help you, I'm not involved with things like this. You're involved! This is happening. You saw what he did to him. I'm not waiting to see what he does to her. - Where are you going? - You wait here. Look here, get her safe. I'll take care. - What? - Go. It's okay, it's okay. I know we're going home. Mom said we're going home. What's going on? Where's my mom. We're gonna wait for her here. It's safe. Is that okay? You can watch a movie. You got away. Finally! Got the whole band back together. Whooo-woohoo! Go find her. Okay, so here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna leave and you're gonna tell your detective friend whatever delusion makes you happy, maybe it'll keep you out of jail. I haven't done anything wrong. Then why am I standing here in your living room? I believe you kidnapped our daughter and were seen in the act. Town and I are a team. We help each other. We survive together. Town doesn't need you. You still think she's on your side. She just used you to get her daughter back. To get our family together. You're just a fall guy. Oh, man. This could have been so easy. All you had to do was just go on with this life, that's it. Just wandered downstream with the rest of the fish. But you got involved. Now look at what you made us do. Town doesn't want to be a part of your family. I know her. Town? Town, Town, come back. And get home. Don't do this. - Do what? - Let them go. Whoa. I'm not holding them. Did you see any struggle? Are they in pain? We're a family. - What are you doing? - Just let me talk to her. - Why? - You did something. She doesn't want to be with you. I'm trying to be nice here. Just let it end! God, look at what you made me do! I told you the plan. Just fucking stick to it this time. You're gonna end up killing them. Don't tell me what I'm gonna do. Just like the man outside. In your mind it'll be nothing but an accident, nothing to do with you, but I know that you are gonna kill them both. Just like you did me, we mean nothing to you! No one gives a shit about you. I should have done this before. Are you okay? Yes. It's just my nose. I called them but they weren't going to be fast enough. Thank you. I recorded it... so that everyone could see exactly what happened. Hey. It's okay. Go be with Sarah. She's afraid. I'm okay. We're okay. Jonathan, what the hell were you doing there? You're not protecting anybody by doing this. This woman is going nuts. She wants you for kidnapping. You have to say who else was there. - Will Town be all right? - Oh, it's pretty clear it was self-defense. We've already let her go. Did you fill out the paperwork? Co-owners. I'm sure everyone will be happy there. Two, three, and then this foot back. On one.
