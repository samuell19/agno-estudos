You Tube - Video Running Time 01:59:30 You Tube search name - Mirza Sahiban Listen to what youth says It says that hearts should come together The closed bud should open... and be strung into a garland It says, someone should just appear... mingle with the breath... and fall in love Someone should come laughing... and give rise to sweet longing... in my heart - Who are you? - An archer! May Allah pierce your heart with this arrow. - Shameless! Aren't you ashamed? - If one is, he's unlucky. If not, one gets milk and honey. You see? Just wait. I'll tell your mother. My name's not Rakho if you're still in one piece. And my name's not Mirza if you have a single water pot left. Just wait. Come on, let's get him. - Chachi (aunt) salaam. - Live long, son. - Where are you going? - Chaudhary's, to give butter. Butter? Chachi, look. Oh! My butter! Scoundrel. May your funeral take place. - Chacha salaam. - Live long, son. Congrats on winning the court case, chacha. You're avoiding us. - Afraid of giving sweets? - Sweets aren't better than you, son? - Forget sweets, just shake hands. - Of course. Ill mannered scoundrel. (A rhyming untranslatable childish retort) I'll tell your mother. Such a child should be strangled. - One day I'll do that too. Salaam Chacha. - Salaam indeed. - Miyanji's (teacher) coming. - Quiet. - Oh, the devil. - Miyanji, what's the devil done to you? - Why are you cursing him? - So it's you, good for nothing. - Son of the devil. I'll tell your mother. - Go on miyanji. Another one makes no difference. Hurry up. Go. Your annoying boy breaks our water pots every day. What should we do? - How can we manage? - Today was my 16th water pot. And my 18th, my 18th. Not only that, today my butter pot too. Let him come. Brother. Are you listening to your dear nephew's pranks? I'm tired of these complaints. - Salaam, sister. - Salaam brother. I've brought a complaint. Your son didn't shake hands with me. If it's so important, I will. I'd make mincemeat of such a child of mine. Useless birth. Chachi, what did he say to you? He ate all my butter. What should I give Chaudhary now? His liver? My God! Such a bad son? He stole all my sweets. Can such a boy go to paradise? - Impossible. - You'll go there before he does. See brother, the day has just started. He's made my life impossible. I wish I could drown myself in a well... or take poison. Children are always mischievous at this age. My children too. Not like him. He's out since morning... without food or water. Let him come. - Ma, Mirza's here. - So, you're back? You're all here. Go away. I'll shut you all up with just one arrow. You've worn me out mentally. Today I'll slaughter you. - Don't come near me. - Silly archer. Move away. Why hit her? Come hit me. How does that help. What are you looking at. Go away. I'll beat him. I'll drink his blood. We'll break his head if he breaks our pots ever again. Do that. Kill him. Is that enough? Go away now. Why did you hit Chatti? You should've hit me. My children. You're a mother. You won't be able to beat them. What to do? The entire village is fed up with him. They always complain. He's so difficult. Sister, a day'll come... when the whole village will praise Mirza. He'll get educated, and become a respectable young man. He? He'll become respectable? The villagers will always curse him. He'll face hurdles. But he won't remain here. I'll take him with me. And when he returns a young man... you'll call your son a diamond. Honestly, brother? Take him, and make him a human. Yes, sister, when he returns... you'll be proud of him. God bless you, brother. If my going makes you happy, I won't go. Let it be. Come on, son. Whose son? Get lost. Come on my dear. Okay, but how'll we go? - On foot. - Go alone. - On horseback? - Yes, only then. - When will you be back, brother? - Whenever I want. Take food for the journey. No need. Get my bow and arrow. Okay, sister, and listen. If Mirza doesn't return, his bow will. - Okay amma, salaam. - Live long, son. Let's go, mamu (uncle). Oh, dear. May Allah break your hands for breaking my beautiful water pot. - Who are you? - I'm Mirza. Why did you shoot this arrow? - I always shoot arrows. - Idiotic archer. - Was this your father's pot? - No, but my mamu's. He's right. He's my nephew. I've brought him back with me. Of course. After all he's your sister's son. I've asked you to think of my sister's son. Help him, but Chaudhary sahab won't. - Okay, mamu, give. - What? - I'm going. - Where? - Home. I won't survive here. Yes, humiliate me. Just brought him over from sister's. Any more insults for Chaudhary in front of this child? Pacify him or else he'll go away. Do you hear? - Yes. - Then be good to him. - Mirza, you'll stay with me. - Think over it first. - Yes, I have. Go and play. - Mamu, should I? Yes, son. Go and play. Hope miyanji falls ill today It will be fun Hope our prayers are heard I'll sit here and teach everyone For one mistake, I'll slipper them four times... and lead him by his ears outside the village Our prayers are answered. - How? - Miyanji is really ill. - He's ill? Today's a holiday. (Children playing a game of flying like a butterfly...) (and finding rhythm in rhyming words...) (none of which make sense if translated.) I hope you die, ugly face. You die, you fat nosed. Your nose is like a scoundrel's fat thumb. I'll strangle you. - I'll break your teeth. - Have you seen your own? Who are you? - I'm Mirza. - Oh, hang Mirza. Swearing? Forgive me. - Will you ever fight with her again? - No. You're very nice. Who are you? - I'm Mirza. - Won't you ask me my name? Why should I bother? Then why fight for me? - That's my habit. - Will you play with me? No, I don't play with girls. Then with whom? - With my bow and arrow. - Idiotic archer. - Why are you following me? - I don't follow girls. I'm going home. - Then walk at a distance. - How, when our way is one. So stubborn. - You won't listen? - You too. - Me? - Yes. Why are you walking with me? - It's you, following me. - I've come home. Shall I call my abba (father)? - Call. - Abba! - Mamu! - What's it Sahiban? - Brother, he's teasing me. Really? I'll deal with him. Why are you teasing her? What are you doing? Brothers fighting with each other? - Yes, son. This is Mirza. - Who cares? Whatever. You have to live here together... and play together. - Are you reading or staring at me? - Think what you wish. - Look at the book. - What's there in the book? A B C D Also on your face. - On my face? - Yes. Your nose is A... eyes B, forehead with chin J. Get up from here. - Why? - It's my place. Oh. So you wish to sit near Sahiban. And I should get up? - I'll teach you a lesson. - Miyanji! Who cares for miyanji. Is this a classroom or a fighting ring? Mirza wants to sit in my place. So you're Mirza. Chaudhary was praising you. - Go and sit at the back. - You're siding with him. - That's unfair. - Go or I'll smack you. - I'll shoot an arrow at you. - Go on. Move back. - Sit. - I will. You too. Miyanji, I can't see Sahiban from here. I'll show you Sahiban, you scoundrel. You've come to learn or look at Sahiban? Quiet. Now answer my questions. Sahiban. Listen. If your ma had Rs 10... and from that your father takes Rs 5. What's left? - A quarrel. - A quarrel? - What are you saying? - She's right. - Her ma never lets out a paisa. - Quiet. Bhuman. If your father buys flour for 1 paisa... sugar for 2, and ghee for 3 paisa... - what do you get altogether? - Halwa. I'll get some for you too. Miyanji, Mirza's sitting near Sahiban again. - You've come back? - Just drifted here with my laughter. Alright. Bhuman, give Mirza a gift. Okay, miyanji. Get up. Hold your ears. - Stop joking. - Hold your ears. - Miyanji's orders. - Let miyanji demonstrate first. Good for nothing. Bhuman, show him. Hold your ears. Not like that. Bend. Did you enjoy school, son? That's the problem. Miyanji beat me today. He boxed my ears. I sit where I can't see Sahiban. You go to learn or watch Sahiban? Shamir. Idiot. Go away. You shouldn't fight. Sit down. Son, I've promised your mother... that I'll educate you well. C'mon, learn. Five and five are ten. - Mirza. - Yes, miyanji? - Where are you sitting? - Near Sahiban. Mirza talks under your nose, and sits in my place. Really? He deserves a gift. Mirza. There's an excellent place for you. Come here. Pick up your bag. Don't stand there. Come here. Go on. Sit there. From here I can't see Sahiban at all. You don't see her? And now? - No. - Quiet. Sit down. Rehmu, how many rivers are there in Punjab? - I'll ask a fisherman. - Stupid. The school's full of idiots. Sit down. Sit. Sahiban, what's the capital city of Punjab? Don't you know anything, miyanji? I hope miyanji dies. - He's so poisonous. - Why? He's always beating you, never Bhuman. - I deal with Bhuman myself. - But miyanji's bad. He's always getting angry. Could it get worse? He can beat me more if he likes. So, you're talking about miyanji behind his back? - I'll go and tell him. - You've appeared here too? Don't run. I'll shoot an arrow. Hold your ears, or here comes an arrow. I swear I'm being tortured. Father used to say, ears are for hearing... but I've found out, they're not. They're for holding. You'll fall. Let me help you. Oh. They're holding hands I can't bear this. He's making love under my nose... and I'm watching, holding my ears? Anyone here? Such unbearable torture. My heart's being shattered. Let him go. People will hear him shouting. Go Bhuman. I'm releasing you because Sahiban asked. Oh, really? I'll see that this romance ends. He saw you hold my hands. He'll spread it around and defame us. - What have you done? - Nothing. We are as we always were since childhood. That was childhood, this is youth. Childhood games become fire in youth. I don't know all that, Sahiban. But yes, today when I touched your hand... I felt a shock in my body. When you held my hands in childhood, it never happened. Sahiban, do you know what this means? The heart knows, and the heart has no tongue. So, how can I tell? On one hand the heart is dancing with joy... and on the other, it beats with fright. Afraid of whom? If someone sees us and... gossip spreads in the village... what if the family hears of it? I don't care what happens. Sahiban, promise we won't ever part. The world can't say anything. We've been like this since childhood. The cruel world accepts childhood games... but not those of youth. Sahiban, why care about the world when we have our own? Look, nature is celebrating our meeting. Look, that pair of birds is chirping with happiness. Like them, we'll make a home one day... with the twigs of love... and decorate it with flowers of happiness. - Mirza. - What? One flew away. The other's left alone. So what? Sometimes separation is part of love. And then, reuniting. What are you thinking? I'm afraid the world might separate us. Like this bird, Sahiban might get left alone. Sahiban, as long as your love abides in my heart... and there's a bow and arrow in my hands... no force can separate us. I believe that, but Mirza... show the world your courage. We're all going to the village fair. You come too. No, that's a worldly fair. This one is of our hearts, beating in togetherness. Today my son will stand out at the fair. Shamir, let me put a black mark to avoid any evil eye. Your's will be the first eye. I'm a mother, not a witch. Don't interfere. - Look, I've changed. - Well done. Beti, bring some soot. - Shamir. - Who, Bhuman? Come in. Come here, I want to say something. Look. My dupatta is so nice. Very nice. And brother, look... it's of silk, from Bukhara. I'm sure it is. You forgot the black mark. Oh, I forgot. Come, son. You dare not tell Shamir anything. Or else get beaten by Mirza. I won't say anything. - Not the whole face. - No, son. - Finished? - Yes. - Okay. I'll go now. - Bhuman. - What happened? - Nothing. I... I... Just came to ask if you're going to the fair. Of course. Okay. So, I'll go now. Crazy. One of you, come forward. - Bhuman. go. - Who me? No. You go. - Don't worry. I'm staying here. - No, no. - Go. I'm saying, go! What can he do to you? Here, I am. - I'm freeing the animal. - Okay. - You'll hit it or run? - I'll hit. - But don't run. Shall I? - Yes. - He's very clever. - Me too. - He's very strong. - Me too. - He's a rascal. - You are too. Did you see Mirza's punch, Noora? - Two lions in combat. - Keep quiet. What's wrong with you? This girl is very shameless. She's shameless. She roams around with that brawny Mirza. - Did you see that? - Yes, for a long time. Chaudhary's honor is in God's hands now. I agree. This has gone too far. I've seen them meeting on the sly. You'll see a lot more. Youth is crazy. I agree. Oh my, it's flying in the wind... this silk dupatta of mine A blast of sweet wind... gave a sweet message By mistake don't accept... a stranger's hand This is the advice of my silk dupatta The one following behind... don't get left behind I fear the uneventful passing... of this pleasant season, my beloved This is the sweet song of the dupatta The sun is setting with a wish in its heart Two hearts are far apart How to get them close? The silk dupatta will bring the hearts together - Come on six. - No six. Three. Come blow on it. - A twelve. It's dead. - Let her die. - She's no use to me. - If not to you... - it's useful to me. - Why man? - Are you going to take to the bottle? - What rubbish. At least two girls are crazy about me. - Have you seen yourself in a mirror? - Why? The one you're crazy about... she goes about with Mirza. What? What do you mean? Don't pretend. Do you know anything about Sahiban? It's Mirza she... meets up with in the forest. Meets him in the forest? - If it's untrue I'll cut off your nose. - Sure. - Show me. - Immediately. Come on. - Shamir. Good you're here. - Why? - It's disgraceful. - What's the matter? - Tell him. - He'll kill me. I won't tell. What's the matter Bhuman? Tell me. It's difficult, Shamir. - What are you saying? - Come and see. Chaudhary, you come too. Your hands on my chest will give me peace My bleak heart will bloom My heart tells me to hide you in my eyes The only fear is of provoking destiny Treat my wounded heart with the balm of your love So I can get some respite from this restlessness For God's sake don't take away my consciousness Don't look at me this way, as it intoxicates me You too will leave like luck does And then death will be attractive Brother! Don't call me brother, and disgrace the word. I feel ashamed to call you sister. A decent family's respect... you've placed at the feet of a vagabond? Vagabond? True love cannot make one a vagabond. You're disgusting. A sinner. But love isn't a sin. I respect you... because someone dear to me... loves you. Your bitter words are sweet... - and curses are blessings. - You're foolish. You roar like a lion but have a heart like a jackal. Who's a coward has been seen by all. You think you're brave? Can you take a beating? Who's brave has been seen by all. Pick up your bow and arrow. Let's see. Don't mention bow and arrow. Once the arrow takes position it won't stop. You've taken his name again? Move away. You're putting your hands in fire. You're trying my patience. I don't want to raise my hands against you for anyone. You don't have the strength. That's why you're standing so far away? Don't dare step forward Shamir. If you have the strength, defend against my attack. Strength? These iron hands which can break this... can also crush your bones. I swear on my love, if I hadn't eaten your father's salt... if my heart wasn't filled with love for Sahiban... I would have pierced your heart with one arrow. We'll see who's heart gets pierced. It's best to go away quietly... as the family honor will suffer either way. So save your own face, and come away. I swear on my honor... if you ever step inside the house... if I ever see you talking to Sahiban... I'll cut you both into pieces. Come on. - Have you heard, sister? - What? About Sahiban and Mirza. - The whole village knows. - She got caught today. Shamir caught them both. Dear God. What a girl. What a shame. Did you see... - Sahiban's behavior? - Yes. The world has turned, son. - What now? - Her parents should know. What is it? - Why are you nervous? - She's asking why I'm nervous. You should be getting nervous... the one being dishonored. - What are you saying? - Not just me, the whole world. Mirza and Sahiban misbehaved at the fair. Aunt, I can't walk in the street anymore. Some say Mirza has dishonored the family. Others say Sahiban has let down her family. There are voices saying... why was shameless Mirza allowed to stay here. Others say he's a snake in the grass. He bit the hands that fed him. Aunt, Mirza has destroyed you. Just step out and hear what people are saying. Yes, that Mirza... and your Sahiban. Truth is stranger than fiction... they are so mismatched. I knew this scoundrel would show his true colors one day. I'll cut him into pieces. I'll break Sahiban's hands and feet. Watch what I do to Mirza today. What do we care what happens to him? I was left gawking... when I begged, pleaded, fell at your feet... for Sahiban's hand. But nobody cared? Anyway who cares. It's you... who's the loser. Such a son-in-law... is unmatched, and unique. First let me kick him out of the house... then we'll see. There's no one better than you. That's true, but what about him? He's the problem, aunt. The crow's enjoying... and the swan's crying. Your ways are strange, God. Very very strange. Okay, I'm going. I'll come again. When I come back, that scoundrel... shouldn't be seen here. Then you'll prove to really be my aunt. And tell Sahiban... Nothing, nothing. See you. Ma, why did you turn your face away? Don't call me mother. My daughter can't be so low down. She can't be so shameless. Instead of youth, death should have come upon you. To see your grave would've been better. I have no one but you. If you turn away... I'll ask for death. When you were born... I should have strangled you. Then I wouldn't have to witness our dishonor. Strangle me, ma. Then, in the presence of god... I can display my broken heart, and ask... you maker of this world... why did you make youth... and if you did, then why make love? I'll be indebted to you ma, if you strangle me. I'll get peace only when... I see Mirza's corpse. Ma, say what you want to me, but spare him. Shamir has beaten him badly. He must have left, repeating my name. I won't go without meeting you. You can't meet her anymore. - Sahiban. - You want to see Sahiban? - Yes, please. - Okay, wait. I'll show you Sahiban. Even if death comes... I don't care. Beat me till you're satisfied. Blood? Did you beat him? Smashed his head? What will the world say? Go and see what the world is saying. Your honor, respect and grandeur... are the target of the people. She was running away with him. Go and drown in shame. - Mirza. - Hey you! - You've come back? - Shamir. Father, don't interfere. What are you doing, Samir? Oh, no. Mirza, look at your state, my child. You can see his state, but not his misbehavior. - Move, aunt. - How can I? Your heart's of stone. Mine isn't. You're inhuman and cruel. Everyone has bloodied him. Aunt, no one has bloodied me. I invited it myself. But I can't see my sister's beloved son... bathed in blood. Sister, you don't have a heart. Chaudhary, you do justice in the village. Your nephew soaked in blood is standing before you. But you're being unjust. Let me get destroyed, aunt. Let my blood run. It will help our love to blossom... get stronger, facing obstacles. I'll ask him for justice. Uncle! The world doesn't know me, but you do. After leaving mother... I took shelter with you. If you too think I'm guilty... then here's my head at your feet. Take my life with my bow and arrow. - Father, first shoot the arrow at me. - Father what are you waiting for? Shoot the arrow. Get up. Before I say anything... take your bow and arrow and go away. My head was bashed... I didn't bother. My blood flowed... I didn't moan. But you've broken my heart. I'm going. God be with you Sahiban. Sahiban, the arrow has left the bow. Don't leave me Mirza. We may part in life... but we'll die together. This I promise. Don't cry, Sahiban. It was destiny's wish. Will you go or not? - Look, eleven. - Not eleven. Two. You won't get 11 even in 11 years. Watch this, with your eyes open. - Here take 25. - It really is 25. Why not? My dear I've been playing for 25 years. - Take this. Give it in my hand. - You keep it. Boss, did you start soon after your birth? What would you know? Watch this. Eleven. You're blocked. So what? I'll set it free in one turn. That's very difficult. It's also a... deadly move. There's no comparison... in the whole of Punjab. You haven't seen his hands yet. What? My hands? Ask Mirza. That day... I gave him one. My finger marks got printed. Really? The whole village knows and you ask, 'really?' That's why we don't see him. How will you see him? Can he face men? How he strutted around with bow and arrow in hand. Your ways are strange, God. Very very strange. But where has Mirza gone? Forget about it. He must be somewhere struggling. Too many places... where youth suffers Too many places where... my story has become disreputable You who's mourning... now even your... support has collapsed Too many places where the flow of my tears will reach The garden which the eyes discovered... got destroyed Too many places to shower my tears on There's a plea on my lips... tears in my eyes... and a stained heart. Too many places where I've hidden your memories So much has happened. Both went to the fair. They talked. As they were young, people observed this. There was gossip. They were shamed. Shamir flew into a rage. He was badly beaten and injured. All because of Sahiban. She fooled my innocent brother... and got him beaten. Her youth should have perished. That witch should have died. Chaudhary, you promised to educate my son... and make him into a good human being. You did very well, brother. Sister, why didn't you bring him with you? Mirza heeds no one. Day and night he chants her name. I asked him to, but he wanted... to go to Sahiban's. Aunt, tell my brother... your mare, Neeli, thinks of you... and your sister's very ill... and might die. He should come for her funeral. He's sure to come then. He'll forget Sahiban and come. Far far from my eyes... the sleep has gone... far Sorrow, my companion... hit so hard that it smashed my heart My companion, my beloved... I hold no grudge against destiny... nor blame you at all... for bringing me to foreign lands... and taking away all from me Tears reside in my eyes, and I'm forced to cry My wounds, oh foreigner, by constant pain... have become sores After making me love sick... sorrow is my illness now My burning flame... has been extinguished by my destiny It's not my fault. I've been deceived by destiny Food is like poison. I can't eat it. Sahiban is hungry, so also that unlucky Mirza. Father, you've taken his name again. Let him die of hunger. Pray for Mirza's death after... you've saved your daughter's life. She's crying away crazily. Would it have been a disaster if they'd married? Marriage with Mirza? Father... if you ever mention it again... I won't stay here a moment longer. I wish to smash his head... and you wish to tie the sehra on his head? Yes, tie the sehra on his head. Get them married, and... complete our disgrace. Mirza has left home, but not your heart. Bhuman's name enrages you. What does he have that Bhuman doesn't? I'll get Sahiban married to Bhuman. He's decent from a decent family. He's well off, not a beggar like Mirza. You can pine away for him. I have to save the family's honor. Honor? You'll pay a heavy price for it. Your eyes will open... the day Mirza's corpse will lie on one side... your daughter's on the other. Your maternal feelings have died. You have a stone instead of a heart. I've said all I wanted. From today, I'll say no more. Save your honor. Glorify your family name. Wash the disgrace. But remember... one day you'll be left with false pride. You'll have no daughter. Sahiban, what's the matter with you? Your eyes are swollen from crying. They'll cry for the rest of my life. Tears will not put out this fire. Be patient. How? Youth has deceived you, crazy girl. No, Noora. My destiny has deceived me. What you thought were flowers, was smoldering coal. But I see only flowers. When it all burns without smoke... you'll know then. I hope all that's mine, burns to ashes... and the breeze take the ashes, and lays it at Mirza's feet. Sahiban, I fear you'll go mad. That'll be good. There'll be no one to stop me. I'll become a mendicant, begging for my love in the streets. Sahiban, think of your old father. People are pointing their fingers at you all. Forget Mirza. He's the enemy of your honor. You come with a spear too? My wound is still not healed. Go away from here. Friend, are you annoyed? I considered you a sister. But you turned out a stranger. I thought you'd soothe my wounds like balm. But you've hurt me. Forgive me sister for giving you pain. Your wound is worse than destiny's. You've become an enemy like the rest. No Sahiban. Wish I could take away your pain. If you wish you could. Me? How? Noora... Look into my damp eyes... and see for whom they are restless. I know for whom. Noora, for God's sake be kind to me. Take pity on Mirza. He's a poor foreigner here. Even the air here is his enemy. Go and console him. What should I tell him? Nothing. Just arrange a meeting. We'll tell each other ourselves. Go, dear Noora. Go. Who? Your unfortunate aunt. I've brought a message. Sahiban's? You're so good, aunt. Not Sahiban's. Your sister's. Even your sister doesn't stir feelings for home. You've become hard hearted, Mirza. Even I don't know what Sahiban has done to me. She has snatched away all you have. After listening about you both... she cursed Sahiban. Why did she do that? - Why didn't she curse me? - She didn't. She's called you home. She's very ill. She asked you to see her, if you want. The last time. Your lovely mare Neeli is thinking of you. Your mother cries day and night. - Did you hear? - I did. But I can't go. I might get a message from Sahiban. Don't be naive. Don't forget yourself. If I could bring with me... your mother's tears, and your sister's pain... you'd see for yourself, how your thoughtlessness... has caused so much suffering. Everyone tries to make me understand... but no one understands me. It's easy to call pain by its name. It's not easy to heal it. Aunt, let me be. The season of pleasure has come. Moonlight has spread Do come my moon (my beloved) A pair of eyes are thirsting Quench their thirst, my moon My heart beats when I think of you The heart flutters... when a friend sings The eyes are searching for you Show a glimpse of yourself When you aren't near then nothing matters It seems no one is longing for love I don't understand this Come and explain it to me, my moon Your moon's here. Shhh. Quiet. Come on. Close your eyes. Come on everybody. Hide! - Where's Sahiban? - Sahiban? - You go. - Yes. Go. You go on about Sahiban... as if she was the only girl in the village. Go and look for her. Unfaithful man. Noora? Are you annoyed? I didn't know... there was place in your heart for me. Because of my size, one needs... a very big heart. Noora, do you love me? Then you'll have to stand by me. I want to know... when and where Sahiban meets Mirza on the quiet. - You'll help me? - Yes. I'll help you, but now you have to go. People will gossip if we're seen together. Now go. You're good, Noora, very good. Where are you going? Not there. - Here. - I forgot. I'm in love. I'll go where you say. - Yes. Go there. - You'll help me, Noora? Yes, yes. But now just go. Something is fishy. Let's go and see. Leave my hand. Noora's coming. Noora's joined our hands. Why fear her? I wouldn't hold your hands only to leave them. Sahiban, promise that our hands will always remain united. Promise you'll come every night. Your silence means, yes. Now the endless days will pass in... the hope that my moon will come. Sahiban, let's go. It's getting late. Noora, you're the light of our world. May God keep you happy. Sahiban, come on. The moon's about to fade away. Noora, not one, but two moons are going to fade away. One in heaven... one on earth. One belongs to the world... the other to Mirza. Come on Sahiban. Stupid me. Why should I be afraid? I'll put an end to these meetings. Shamir, it's time to get Sahiban married. We must arrange it with Bhuman. Don't worry, mother. I'll see to it today. - You have a long life. - Long life? Shamir, it's my wish to see my life end. - Your brain is as fat as you. - Why? Mother just mentioned you, for Sahiban. And you're fed up with life? Mirza has gone. No fear. Mirza's gone? But Shamir, Mirza has left home, not the village. Not from Sahiban's heart. When you all are asleep at night... Sahiban meets him on the quiet. How's it possible? I kicked him out of the house. I've seen it myself. If it's so, I'll beat Mirza to pieces. You'll beat him to pieces? Why? Does he come to meet Sahiban? So I have to kill Sahiban. What's it to Mirza? It's your sister getting killed. What should I do? How to take revenge? I'll show you the way. Listen. Lock Sahiban at home for some days. She won't meet him, and love will be contained. No fire, no smoke. As time passes she'll forget him. A disappointed Mirza will leave the village. - Then there can be a wedding. - Okay. - I'll do it. - That's it. Noora, Shamir's guarding the door. - Now what? - Now What? And you claim to be in love? When Soni wanted to meet Mahiwal... she jumped into the raging river. Can't you jump off the terrace? Come on. Jump. I'll try. Come on. Hurry. I'll see how she goes out today. You've come, but where's my moon? Your moon's here too, Mirza. - Where's Noora? - I'm here. Sahiban, you're so late. Didn't you consider how I wait all day for you? Your Sahiban has deceived death to come here. Brother was guarding the door. I've jumped from the terrace to come here. You do so much for me. Not for you. For me. Till I see your face... I'm restless. After seeing your face... I'm still restless. I'm in agony before meeting you... I'm in agony after meeting you. Is the other name of love, agony? When two hearts meet for a moment... the whole life's agony disappears. I see you for a while every night... and spend the day thinking of you. Now even this is difficult... for my heart says this is our last meeting. Don't say that, Sahiban. - Sir. - Me? Sir? Who is it? - Oh, it's you? - You, unfaithful. My Noora. My life. Light of my love. Go on. Don't try to catch me in your web. Oh. Okay. I'll go then. Annoyed? And you swore you loved me. Say it once more. No one has ever called me, Sir. Noora, say it once more. Sir. Live a thousand years. But tell me. Who are you waiting for? At midnight? Really! The one for whom I'm miserable... asks me this question. What did I know... that God would grant me such a great boon. I don't feel like going where I was supposed to. Where was Sir going? You said Sir, again? Sir was going in search of Sahiban. You mentioned Sahiban again? I've told you not to mention her in front of me. - I won't. - If Sahiban is the sun, I'm the moon. Oh, my moon. Okay. See you later. Here. Where are you going, after wounding my heart, Sir? Sir? Again? When you say... Sir, my heart beats faster. Today the love story must be completed. Our eyes will meet... Every one sees with eyes. The story is completed when... one sees one's beloved even with closed eyes. - Really? - If it's true love, close your eyes and find out... whether you see me all around. Closed eyes? Done. I can't see anything. Noora? I really can't see a thing. Noora? Hurry, let's go. Bhuman's here. - No Mirza. - Come on. No, no. From here. So, that's what it is! Made a fool of me with her Sirs! Shamir said he'd guard the entrance. Must have gone off to sleep. Well. I'll see to you three. It's late. I've to cut grass for fodder. Didn't sleep all night. - Sure, you were guarding all night. - And how! - Even air couldn't pass. - Not air, perhaps... but Sahiban did. That's a lie. I saw it myself. Impossible. I'd blocked the door all night. Yes, yes. All night.. You may have done that... but she went out anyhow. - Did she? - Yes. This girl has ruined our reputation. Not she. Mirza. But brother... if you were so concerned... you'd have destroyed Mirza by now. Bhaiya, where are you going with the axe? To cut Mirza to pieces. He has disgraced our family. Before Mirza, cut your sister to pieces. If I could do that, I'd have done it by now. Shamir, wait. It's not your place to take revenge while I'm alive. Mirza has disgraced me. I'll be the one to take revenge. Okay. Then take this. This axe will only injure him... not his love. I know what to do. I knew you'd come to wipe my tears away. I'm in no position to do that. I myself am crying. I've come to ask you for something. My family's respect... Sahiban's life, and an old man's dignity... you've taken all this away. Uncle, what are you saying? I thought you sympathized with me. I thought, the world might go against me... but you'd still love me. I knew you'd come to... give me my life, my happiness. I didn't come for that. I came to ask for Sahiban's life and happiness. Her life and happiness lies in our meeting. No. Her life and happiness... - lies in parting from you. - Uncle... if that happens, she'll die anyway. If you don't listen, she'll have to kill herself. Suicide? Yes. Her reputation is ruined in the village. Our life has become difficult here. You deny ruining her? Three lives have been pained at home. Her mother's not eating or drinking. Her brother's sleep and rest have gone. Her old father is unable to face the village. How long will she see this, and bear it? The day you first talked of love with her... you took away her happiness and ruined her life. Son, I brought you like a light to our home. I didn't realize then it would set fire to our home. Reflect. Try to understand the situation. I could... but love won't. Love? You call it love? Ruining the home of the one you love? Taking her life? If you loved her, you wouldn't do this. You can still save Sahiban. - How? - Go away from here. Uncle, it's impossible. How's it possible? I can't live without her. How can one slay oneself? With my own hands, break my heart? Uncle, don't be so cruel. Don't force me to leave. Chaudhary has never begged a favor from anyone. Today, I beg of you. A sorrowful father has come to your door to beg. Don't turn me out empty handed. If you want Sahiban and her family to live... go away from here. For my sake. If not, then for God's sake. If not for God, then for the sake of Sahiban, go. You've forced me, for the sake of Sahiban. I'll go. - God be with you. - God be with you. No use going there anymore. Don't say that. Mother's become my enemy. Brother has snatched away my happiness. I didn't care. But father, you cannot be cruel. You don't have a heart of stone. You know I've not committed any sin. Let me go father. He must be waiting for me. Daughter, there's no one waiting there today. He must be waiting impatiently. Let me go, father. He'll tire of waiting for me. I've seen his impatience while waiting for me. The moon is high. Let me go, father. I know... you won't be able to bear what I'm going to say. Your heart will break... but it's the truth.. The person you're going to meet... isn't here anymore. Mirza has left the village. Don't say that. It's impossible. Mirza cannot leave... without meeting me. You're lying. You don't want me to meet Mirza. This cannot happen. The world can change... Mother can abandon her daughter... brother can deceive his sister... father can take away her happiness... but Mirza won't do such a thing. Mirza will never leave me, father. Where are you? Have you really gone? May you prosper together. Tell me where Mirza has gone? How would you know? You too are suffering from the pangs of separation. Mirza, I have no sympathizer now. No companion. No one to show me the way. You tell me why you have left. What did I do? You know... for you I got a bad name in every street. Mocked in every home. Mother, father, brother have become my enemy. You were the only support. And now you've gone. Mirza, where are your promises? And all that you said? Tell me. Is this your love? Was this your love? I was waiting If you wanted to go away... why did you fall in love? That we'd never part... I was confident about Why have you come to meet... bringing the pieces of your heart? The heart, which is soaked in blood today... was full of love for someone You're going to get married. You'll forget us in your husband's house. Sister, I'm not happy about anything. I think of my brother all the time. Where's the poor man? How's he faring? Your jewelry's here. You brother would have been so happy today. Take these away. Bring my brother if you want me to be happy. God, I'll be so grateful... if I can meet him once. Neeli, what happened to you? Who are you? - Son! My son. - Brother. - Who? - Chatti It'll take time to recognize others. What others? - Chatti, your sister. - Brother! What a state you're in. Chaudhary said he'll educate you. And make him a human. What did he do? What a great favor he has done me. My son was like a lion. His daughter snatched all away. Don't go anywhere, my son. I don't want to educate you. I don't want to civilize you. I may not go anywhere. But I've promised her... when she calls... I'll go to her. Who? That blood sucking witch? I won't let you go anywhere now. I won't let you step out. If a messenger comes from her... I'll break his bones. Sahiban, do you see? They are my sympathizers... and yet they want us parted. Crazy boy. I don't need these clothes. What you consider a wedding is a funeral for me. Bring me a shroud, mother. What a wet blanket. Girl, control your tongue. Crying on such a happy day. What are you mourning? Think, and understand. Noora, make her understand. I'll talk to her. Hey, but no hanky-panky. I'll sort out everything. You go amma. What are you saying? Making a mockery of love? Not yet satisfied with the disgrace? What to do? You know... Mirza's name is etched on all the broken pieces of my heart. He's my bridegroom, my companion. If I've ever thought of another man, let a lightning bolt strike me. I know everything. That's why I say... wear your bridal clothes happily... and smile. A bride isn't sad on her wedding day. Don't sprinkle salt on my wounds like others. Like others, I want to see you as a bride. But while they see Bhuman as your groom... I see Mirza. May you always be happy. But how's it possible? How? That's what I'm wondering too. I can't see a way yet. You once said, love finds its own way. Yes, there's only one way. I'm thinking about going to Mirza. Noora, then why don't you? What a lazy response. It doesn't match my quickness. Should I just go? No petition. No pleading. No bribery. It's a matter of life and death. And you're joking? I fall at your feet, and beg you to... go, tell Mirza. If he doesn't come now, time will run out. If you want our happiness, then come like the wind. Go Noora, before celebration turns to mourning here. Bring the light of my happiness. Come and listen to the story of our parting What the heart bears... I'll tell you with my eyes Give him my message that... like the world, he mustn't forget about me. The only thing my tear-filled eyes request of him now... either he should send death or come himself If he asks how I am, tell him... I'm alive, but praying for death Open the door, Mirza. - Who are you? - I'm Noora. - I've come to meet Mirza. - Whoever you may be... Mirza won't meet anyone. I have an important message from Sahiban. From Sahiban? Then you must meet him. Come. Mirza mentioned you as being very nice. And Sahiban? He thinks of her all the time. He's greatly indebted to you all. - Where is he? - I'll take you to him. He sits in this small, dark room, thinking of her. - Here? - Yes. Come on. Open the door. For God's sake open the door. It's a question of Sahiban's life and death. Sahiban's life and death? Ha. What about poor Mirza? Sending messages? Sahiban must be thinking... some of Mirza's bones must be intact. Why spare them? Scream all you like in there. Noora's voice? Here? I'm here in this small room. - When did you come? - Forget the greetings. First let me out. I'm suffocating. Not my love affair, nor my message, but I'm the one imprisoned. - Message. - I won't tell you anything... First get me out of this suffocating place. Your sister imprisoned me here. She should have been a constable. Mirza, whose wedding preparations? My sister's. Baraat's (groom's party) about to arrive. Leave this. How's Sahiban? There too a baraat will arrive. A happy one here. A mournful one there. What do you mean? Is Sahiban happy? Till now, yes. But if you... don't go there like the wind, she won't be. Bhuman is bringing his baraat. The one she's waiting for is miles away. She's sent a message. If you don't come now, it's of no use later. I will go. We are married spiritually. Our spirits can't be parted. While I'm alive, no one dare even look at her. Noora, you go. Tell Sahiban not to be sad... to dry her tears. I'm coming. I will come. You go Noora. Be happy Sahiban. Mirza will come. Who opened the door? Where's the messenger? Brother, where are you going? I told you I would get a message. It was cruel to imprison Noora. It's a question of Sahiban's life and death. If Noora hadn't met me today... it would have been disastrous. Mirza and Sahiban's love... would have shed tears forever. - I'm going to meet Sahiban. - Is that all you see? It's your sister's wedding. The baraat is about to come. The ceremony is soon to take place, and you're going out. Without you, how'll your sister marry? Who'll perform the rites? Who'll welcome the baraat? Who'll carry me to the palanquin? Here there's happiness... and there it's the ruin of two people. Here it's a day of rejoicing; there, for mourning. Mirza is a sister's brother; a bride's groom. Sister can wait; the bride cannot. I promise. I'll go like the wind, and return like the storm. I'll perform all the rites; carry you to the palanquin. My good sister, let me go. Don't stop me. You can't go. There can't be a wedding without you. This wedding can be delayed. That won't be. If I'm delayed, it will be disastrous. The mehndi on my hands pleads with you to stay. You have henna on your hands... while someone's wishes are being killed. You can't see what I see. Sahiban is waiting with tears in her eyes. If her patience runs out.. And I'm delayed, Sahiban won't be... found alive. Let me go. I promise I'll come back. Neeli, bring my brother back. Run hard. My brother is going into danger. If anything happens to him, I'll hold you responsible. Nothing will happen to your brother. As long as I have my bow and arrow... even death won't dare to come. Okay mother, Chatti. Sahiban is calling me. You're leaving your sister? It isn't right, brother. There in front, in the alley, is my house Don't forget my address The moon will shine on the hearts Taking your name, I sigh deeply A wounded heart with fear of the world Noora, what'll I do if he doesn't come? Get me some poison. If waiting is fruitless... I'll end my life immediately. Don't say that. He'll come. Wipe your tears away. It's your wedding today. I'm feeling nervous. Bring her quickly. - Why are you so impatient? - Because of the situation. Where are you taking me? He won't come. No Sahiban. He promised. He'll come. I told you he'd come. Take out the horses. Follow them. The baraat is here, but Mirza isn't. He'll come. He promised me. He'll carry me to my palanquin. He owes me. Neeli, you've promised someone, remember? Go faster, Neeli. There's nothing here. Shamir took all the horses? What to do now? - Sir? - Go. Unfaithful. I'm going after Sahiban. But how to go? There's no mount. Sir, I've brought an excellent mount for you. - Do you like it? - Yes. You go home now. - Where are you taking me mother? - Don't be crazy. - Your palanquin has come. - But brother hasn't. I won't go. Hold the reins Come on, walk on. Don't you know Mirza has run away with my bride? - Sahiba, let go. - No! What happened, Mirza? Nothing, Sahiban. Come on. Water! Water! He promised. He will come. Don't worry Sahiban. Death won't come... because I promised my sister I'll come. There he is, with his bow and arrow, riding Neeli swiftly... tearing through his way. Thinking of his sister... he's riding here like a storm. Where's my brother? You promised to bring him back. Where's the promise about the bow and arrow? The celebration has turned to mourning. The sehra flowers have become tears. The palanquin has become the pyre. Who's taken your life? Who broke your bow? Why did you break my bow? I promised my sister... I'd carry her to the palanquin. Forgive me, Mirza. This is our last meeting. The arrow is leaving the bow, Sahiban. Don't say that, Mirza. As it is my heart is tearing. I won't be able to stay alive without you. Remember your promise... of spending our lives together. Where are you going, leaving me all alone? Sahiban, may death come to you. May your youth be ruined... your happiness burn away. May you struggle in life. May you have no support. May you too die in agony, like my brother. Mirza where are you going? You said we'd always be together. I've lost everything. There's no support without you. Come back Mirza. Don't leave me. Sahiban, I'm leaving. I cannot leave you. I'm coming with you, Mirza.
