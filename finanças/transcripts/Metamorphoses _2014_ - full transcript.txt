"My design leads me to speak of forms changed into new bodies." Ovid metamorphoses Europa & Jupiter Asshole! Realized who I am? No. I'm taking you away, Europa. Your life is going to change. Are you serious? - I'm kidnapping you. - You're saving me. I know that man. He weeps for his daughter. He doesn't know where she is. Or even if she's alive. That man weeps because of me. His daughter's name is Io. She vanished like that, overnight. I'll carry on my way. Wait. Help! Go! What are you doing here naked? Nothing. Someone's with you. No. What are you imagining? What's that? A heifer. She came to lie next to me. She must have lost her herd. There are no herds around here. She's beautiful. I'll take her with me. I'll entrust her to Argus. If she's skittish, she won't escape from him. As you want. That's sick. Helping her meant denouncing myself. What became of her? She stayed a cow forever? My wife gave her to Argus, a man with 100 eyes. I couldn't help her. Not directly. But I asked Mercury... Who's he? One of my sons. The cleverest. I asked him to kill Argus to free Io from the curse. Tell me where your instrument's from. My panpipes? It must have a story. At the foot of Arcadia's icy peaks, among all the nymphs, one was more famous than the others. Her name was Syrinx. Many a time, she had escaped from the satyrs and the gods dwelling in the forest and surrounding countryside. One day, she met Pan on her path, in his favourite outfit. Right away, he tried to seduce her and Syrinx took flight. Bitch! Bitch! What do I do? Concerning my wife? No, concerning your stories. That's up to you. You can believe me or think I'm mad. Are you scared? No, I'm not scared. So why not believe me? Believe what? I can make you a very happy woman. No promises, ok... Didn't they tell you at school about Io? Turned into a heifer by Jupiter? No. You know nothing. Nothing at all. Maybe... Teach me. It's no use if you don't believe me. All right. I'll make an effort to believe you. Baucis, where did you find these three? Hello! He's my husband. Come, I'll make food for you. I'll get another. Is there any wine left? Don't worry. We've eaten well. You've nothing else to offer us. We have a goose. Where is your goose? Bastards. Don't worry about them. She's too strong for you, forget it. Come back up. We'll continue our meal. Your goose will live to 100. Want me to help? I'm all right. I'll manage. You have to follow us now. Your hospitality saved you. What can I do for you? We're going to die soon. Neither of us will be strong enough to remain alone. We'd like to die together. Goodbye, my husband. Goodbye, my wife. Baucis is the poplar. And Philemon the maple. It's you, my darling. Why are you naked again? I'd like to be a woman sometimes. What are you saying? I envy your orgasms. So self-satisfied... It's true. I can see your pleasure is more intense. Rubbish. I heard a woman's orgasm is eight times that of a man. Don't you have other worries? No. Cut it out! Goodbye. They're still here? Yes, but I have to go, doctor. - All right. - Thank you. Show me that one. See, I told you. - How long were you a woman? - Seven years. You'll settle our argument. You've known the pleasure of both sexes. Only you can answer. Who has the greatest pleasure, man or woman? Undoubtedly woman. Rubbish! I knew it. There's no comparison. When I was a woman... Speak for yourself. Calm down, my love. I say it's a quality. No one holds it against you. In fact, we envy you. Who are you to utter such bullshit? I'm answering your question. Not at all. Just shut up. You're a man. Men know nothing about women. How dare you speak for us? As a woman, I had a woman's sex. You weren't born a woman. I became one. I was a woman. I saw that I was. Vagina, breasts, hips... Everyone saw I was a woman. I didn't decide. The men who wanted me saw a woman. I know what I felt and saw. I don't like your words. Juno, no... He's so proud of himself. "I'm man, I'm woman..." - We're going. - No, we're not. I won't have some mortal thinking he knows more than I do! Don't blame him. I asked for his opinion. Tiresias... Seeing is believing. Isn't that the way to believe? You understand? Isn't it the way to see? Juno, don't do it. Asshole. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Tiresias. What has she done? She's blinded you, my friend. I can't undo what she has done. No god can. Listen... I'll allow you to see the future. As compensation. You're telling me everything? I am. Why are you worried? He's so beautiful, I'm scared for him. Yes, I understand. He's very beautiful. Can I ask you something? Go ahead. You see the future, so tell me that Narcissus will have a long, happy life. Tell me I needn't be afraid. Come. He'll have a long, happy life. If he doesn't know himself. Go! Go, Narcissus! What a pass! - Stay, Narcissus. - I'm going. I have errands for my mum. I'll come with you. No, stay, it's ok. I want to go too. I don't need you. Echo, get off my back too. I said I'd do the shopping. Mum... I see some are interested in me. It's as if... As if they felt they could love me, as if they hoped to find inside my soul... something. A sort of secret. They must feel freer or stronger believing that. But I know they're mistaken. I know myself. There is no secret. Because... there's nothing. Just me. Jupiter! I want to know love Europa & Bacchus This tiny creature is Arachne, a young fool who wove beautiful tapestries. She defied Minerva, Jupiter's daughter, also an expert in needlework. It came to a bad end. Well, she turned into a spider. Who are you? I'm Bacchus, son of Jupiter. Another son of Jupiter? There's a lot of us. Arcas, Pollux, Hercules, Perseus... Only those he had with mortals. You're not a god? I am. I'm the youngest one. The most fearsome and sweetest of the gods. My mother had an affair with Jupiter but she wasn't as lucky as you. She died, struck by lightning. Fear not, he'll come for you. He'll give you a Greek island where you'll be queen. I don't want to be a queen. You should do. Greece is the mother of us all. Where're you going? Your stories make my head spin. I'm starting to feel scared. There's nothing to fear. How will I end up? As bracken? A fish? A pebble? Fear not. I'll protect you. - The most fearsome of gods? - The sweetest too. I only attack those who doubt my divine nature. You're not the doubting type. What if I were? I have reasons to stop believing you all! I don't advise it. The last girls who doubted in me came to a bad end too. Three of them. Three sisters. Three idiots! The Minyas sisters. Expert unbelievers. They laid into my mother. They said no god had loved her, that I was a bastard! So I found them. It's easy for us to find mortals. Want to go outside, girls? - Who are you? - To go where? Why would we? Because you have no choice. And I have the power to make you. I'll be waiting outside. What's this car? Want to drive? Here you go. You two hop in the back and start to strip. Because we're going for a little dip. You're sick in the head. Hit the road! I'm taking you to a special place. A famous one even. The Strabon Pond. You know it? No. Hey! Know the Strabon Pond? No! Of course not! You're thick as bricks! The Strabon Pond is well known for its debilitating water. Know what that means? - It makes you dumb? - What? I dunno, retarded? Mad! Crazy! Why go swimming in water that attacks your brain? "Debilitating" is the adjective for something that diminishes someone's strength. Ok? Yes. Now you know. Here's the story... The water wasn't always like that. It changed for the worse after a prayer. A young man's prayer. The young man's name was Hermaphrodite. Ogling the girls, are we? No, I'm watching the birds. They all say that. Can I take a look too? You're a pretty one. What's a handsome boy doing all the way out here? I don't want to disturb you. Disturb me all you want. It's better being with someone else. It's much more fun and... much more exciting. - I hadn't planned to stay. - Stay. It's so hot! I'm sweltering. Coming for a swim? The water's probably cold. It'll redden our skin. What is it? I'm not your type? Tell me, have you got a girlfriend? No. What then? I'm not beautiful enough for you? What's the problem? My breasts are too big for you? Is it my behind? Or my legs? Not straight enough? Nothing to say about all that? You don't give a damn? Or you're just dumb! Enough of this, I'm going. Go for a swim. I was lying, the water's great. My beloved gods! Ensure we shall never be apart, I from him and he from me! Grant me grace. I entered the water a boy and now... I emerge I don't know how. Make anyone who bathes here lose all power and strength. I'll see to it, my boy. Our turn! Wet the back of your neck. I don't understand. You've nothing to fear if you don't believe in us. We could have danced. We could have laughed. Been happy. I don't understand. Was it that hard to believe in me? I know what you're thinking. You think it's a bit weird being here. You'd like to go home. But what awaits you there? Is your life that extraordinary? Tell me about it. People's lives interest me. Recall your last day there. How does it begin? Alarm at 6:30 am? You switch it off so it won't wake the whole family. You're a good girl. You go to the kitchen, boil water, then use the toilet. You come back to your cup and teabag. You think about toasting some bread but you're too lazy. So you devour two biscuits that make you feel sick. Bathroom. No shower. You stare at your mug for 20 minutes with the night's dream in your mind. You change your top, panties and socks. Then you do your teeth and makeup. You bring your shoes in. You daydream a little on hearing the neighbours talk. Back in the kitchen, you see your dad listening to the radio over his coffee. His breath disgusts you. He must have had two biscuits too. How much did that whore's skirt cost me? You'd have killed him. But you had nothing to do it with. Come and meet my friends, the Bacchantes. Anybody here? I heard you. Pentheus, a mortal cousin. I don't like them. It's you. Why are you here? You know why. I want my mother and my aunt and all the others you took. Really? Want to know where they are? Stop it, Bacchus. It's over. - They'll kill you. - Kill me? No one will kill anyone. I'll just go there and talk to the girls you've abused. I'll erase all the filth you've made them believe. I'll restore their reason. Their reason? You forget I can make them lose it. Who do you think you are? Your spiel may work on young girls but not on me. Europa isn't a Bacchante. I don't give a damn. I want to take my mother home. Ask her if she wants to go. - What? - She's listening. She's listening? Where have you hidden her? Mum? Mum, it's Pentheus. Recognise me? I'm your son, Pentheus. Fuck... What is this shit, Bacchus? That's being a god? I didn't do anything. You didn't stop them. Maybe I am worse than the other gods. People believe others but make fun of me. They won't take me seriously. I have to. I'll take you back? No. Know who's looking for you? Your brother. He's going all over town with your photo, praying and dreading the worst. Your father told him not to come back until he finds you. Wait! Do you recognize her? Sorry, I've never seen her. Ok, thanks. You're welcome. Goodbye. How old's your brother? Sixteen. Want to speak to him? I'm not sure. Speak without him seeing you. I love you. Don't worry about me. Europa! There's a man there! What's happened, my friend? You wanted to go back? Stay calm, girls, you hear? Calm. - What's wrong? - He can't stand women since his died. So they hate him. Where's he going? To his disciples. I want to follow. Of course. Everyone does. Even the trees. Can I go? Do as you want. I'm not your father, my girl. I'll tell you the secret of secrets. Mouths are gateways for the soul. Tell everyone that. Europa & Orpheus What's going on? Nothing. Yeah, sure. Eric. Serge. Thomas. Marcel. François... I'll speak to you in a strong voice. And to you non-believers. I shall speak the truth. The soul is enclosed in men's bodies as in a tomb. Man's soul is subject to perpetual reincarnation in the body of a man, an animal or a flower, like you Narcissus. It is a prisoner of the circle of generations. Only a virtuous and benevolent life leads to a better reincarnation. Life comes after death which comes after life. Life surrounds our death. I ask you not to commit murder or blood sacrifices. You must fast and not eat what has been killed. Lead a life of asceticism and purification. Then the circle of reincarnation will be broken. Stop wearing clothes made of wool, dress in white and never approach a dead person. Souls that have attained Orphic purity will become immortal and will no longer be reincarnated. From men, you will become equal to the gods. I'll ask you to leave now. It's for safety reasons. We respect your loss but this is a public place... Get lost! We live here! You don't live here! There's no sense in clashing. Please leave. You have to leave. We're here for safety reasons. Go now, please. Fucking nutters! Yesterday, I spoke about Ganymede, a young man loved by Jupiter. Today, I'll tell you about Atalanta who refused to love anyone. A god had advised her never to marry. She would not die if she did, but would no longer be herself. And so, to discourage her suitors, she challenged them to a race. Each time, she promised to marry the one who ran faster than her. And each time she won. Venus believed in their love. She decided to help Hippomenes. Venus was happy for them. She was fond of them. Really. But, swept away by his new love, Hippomenes forgot to thank her. Venus felt she deserved a little gratitude. She began to hate them. She wanted revenge. In Hippomenes and Atalanta's bodies, she lit a desire that they could not resist. Orpheus, we return your wife Eurydice to life. But we ask you not to look back until you both leave the realm of the dead. It's me. Look. The Bacchantes. We have to go home now. We've no reason to. Dad's waiting for us. Go if you want. I'm staying here. Here. Give that to Dad. Go now. Just go, please. "My design leads me to speak of forms changed into new bodies. O gods, give breath to my work and carry this my poem from the distant origins of the world to my own time." Ovid, The Metamorphoses 1 AD
