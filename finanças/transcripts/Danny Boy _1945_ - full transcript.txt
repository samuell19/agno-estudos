(extravagant orchestral music) (drums rumbling) - Company halt! Left face! Hey sis! Hey sis! You think he'll come on this train? - Of course, Jimmy, the telegram said so, didn't it? - Yeah, but I'm so excited I don't know what I'm doing. Here she comes! Oh boy, I hope he's on this one. Hey, fellas! Come on, boys. Line up. Come on, hurry up. All right, keep your places, boys. One, two. (exciting band music) - Joe! - Hey, where is he, Jimmy? - I don't know. - I don't see him yet. - Maybe he missed the train. - Joe, darling. - Gee, Marge, you look wonderful. - Hey, Joe! Joe, hey Joe, Joe! - Hiya, pal. - Hi! I thought Danny boy was comin' with ya. - He did come with me, Jimmy. - Then where is he? - [Kid] Hey, Jimmy. Here he is. Here's Danny Boy! (kids cheering) - Danny Boy! Hello fella! Speak to me, Boy. Speak to me. - Which one of you boys is Jimmy Bailey? - I am, mister. - And I suppose you want to take your mutt home with ya, huh? - He ain't no mutt. He's a thoroughbred and a war hero. - Oh, I'm sorry son. I apologize. Here just sign this receipt right here. Fine, thank you. Now we'll let the hero out of his cage. (soft bugle music) - Good heavens! Why did Danny Boy get all the ribbons and medals? They're yours, aren't they? - Well, I thought I'd give Jimmy a big thrill. - Oh, that was swell. Thanks Joe. - Helpers Club of America, Unit Seven, we have come here today to welcome home and to honor Danny Boy Bailey, a hero of this World War enlisted in the service of our country in July 1942 and fought with United States Marines driving the Japs out of Guadalcanal and other islands in the South Pacific. Brave devil dog, we pay our respect to you. "Amen." - Hello, fella, you're my boy aren't ya? - He doesn't know you anymore, Jimmy. He's forgotten all about you. - He does so know me. He's just acting strange because of the band and the crowd. He don't like the people to make a fuss over him. - Ah, if he knew you, he'd whine you speak to him like you used twhen o. And he'd be kissin' you all over the face. - You just don't understand, Pudgie. He's waitin' until we get home to show his affection for me. When nobody is looking at him. - Jimmy, how long has your dog been away from ya? - Two years, three months, and 27 days. - Well, no wonder he's acting strange. You'd be that way too son if you'd been away from home that long. - Sure, you'll have to get used to being a civilian again. Well, fellas, thanks a lot for helping me welcome Danny Boy home. I know he appreciates it just as much as I do. Now, we're going home. Come on, boy. Mom's waiting to see you. (soft music) Mom! Mom! - Here I am, dear. Why Jimmy, what's the matter? - They made a mistake, mom. They sent me somebody else's dog. - What make you think so, dear? - Well, if he's my dog he'd be glad to see me, wouldn't he? - [Mom] Yes. - Well, he doesn't even know me at all. - Oh, come here Boy. What's the matter with you? Have you forgotten us? - See? See, mom? He doesn't know you either. He isn't Danny Boy. And I know he isn't. - Well, maybe he'll remember his kennel. Why don't you try that? - Well, I never thought of that. Come on, Boy. See, Boy? That's where you used to sleep, remember? Go on in and look around. It's no use, mom. He isn't my dog. - Well, we'll soon find out whether he is or not. - How? - I'm surprised at you, dear. Have you forgotten the scar Boy got on that barbed wire? - Oh, yeah, that's right. Down Boy. Down, down, fella. It's Danny Boy, all right. Here's the scar. You are my dog aren't ya? What's the matter fella? Why don't you know me? Have you forgotten all the good times we used to have together? What's the matter, mom? Why doesn't he know me? - Oh, don't get all upset, dear. Maybe all the fighting he's been through is why he acts so strange. - Maybe. - I bet you Joe Cameron will know the reason. - Yeah, I'll bet Joe will know because Boy was with Joe's outfit in the South Pacific. I'll go find Joe and Margie right now. They're on their way home from the station. - Wait, dear. Joe and Margie haven't seen each other in a long time. And I don't think we should bother them just now. - Yeah, but, well, when can I see 'em? - How about tonight? Joe will be here for dinner. - Okay, can I take Boy for a walk. - Sure. - Okay, come on, Boy. Hello, Mrs. Johnson. - Hello, Jimmy. - Hello, Jacky. You see who just got back home today? Joe Cameron brought him back from the detraining camp. - Well, isn't that nice? You're happy I'll bet. - I'll say. Well, come on, Boy. Let's go. Goodbye Jacky. Bye there. - Goodbye, Jimmy. Come on, Jacky. We're going home now. Come on darling. We have to go. How are you Mr. Andrews? - Very much provoked, Mrs. Johnson. Now, I don't want to fight you. But I feel it's my neighborly duty to warn you about that war dog. He's a menace to the community. - But Danny Boy has always been so gentle and friendly. What's there to be afraid of? - Evidently you're not familiar with the training of war dogs. - Well, I've just never thought about it. - They wouldn't use a friendly dog to kill Japs, would they? - I suppose not. But surely the government wouldn't send a vicious dog home, would they? - Oh, certainly not. But no one can read a dog's mind. Something might happen to make him a killer again. And you'd better little Jacky in the house if that dog's allowed to run loose. - I will. Thanks for the warning. - Don't pull away. Keep your head on my shoulder like you used to. Look. Do like the picture, you and me. Come on now. Let's try it again. Come on. Say, Joe, that's how he's been actin' ever since I brought him home. He doesn't know me, or mom, or anybody else. He doesn't even know that he used to live here. Tell me man to man, Joe. I can take it. What's the matter with him? - There's nothing the matter with him, Jimmy. Nothing that patience and a little kindness won't cure. - Then why doesn't he know me instead of treating me like a stranger? - Don't worry. He will in time. You must remember, Jimmy, that he's in a sort of fog like I was when I first came back from the South Pacific. You see, he's been trained to forget you and everything connected with his civilian life. And he was brought back from the South Seas and retrained to make him forget that he ever was a soldier. Is it any wonder that he's a little mixed up? - No, I guess not. - He'll snap out of it in time like I did. And it'll be just like coming out of a bad dream. Hey, Danny Boy, I know what you're going through, fella. We were there together weren't we? - I'd like to help him, Joe. Is there anything that I could do? - Of course there is, Jimmy. I don't have to tell you to be kind to him, but overdo it. He needs lots of affection and praise for every little thing he does. When you go out to play take him along with ya. Take him to places he used to know and get him to do things he used to do. - Hey, he used to help me carry groceries home from the store. - That's what I mean. - And when we went camping, I used to take him along with me. - Swell. That kind of comradeship will help a lot to bring them out of his battle fatigue. - Gee, but you're a well pal, Joe. Just talking things over with you makes me feel a lot better. - Makes me feel good too, Jimmy, when I can help out a pal. - Say, by the way, have you tried any gentle obedience commands on him yet? - No, I was so upset I didn't know what to do with him. - Well, why don't you try a few. You know, a wolf never forget to up, down, stay, sit, or heel. - Okay, come on, boy, heel, heel. That a boy. Come on now. Heel. Come on boy. Look he's mindin'! Come on. Look sis, he's mindin' me. - That's swell, Jimmy. Mom told you Joe would know what to do. - Oh, you're the most swellest and bestest dog in the world. You're gonna get all right too I betcha. - Are you two men through with your dog talk? - Yes, dear, why? - Well, dinner is almost ready. So you better come along. - Hey, Joe, tell sis about the night battle on Iwo Jima and how Boy won a citation for saving your life. - After dinner, Jimmy, it'd take too long now. - Hey, sis, look, here's Boy's citation. Joe brought it back from Camp Lejeune. That's where they train and detrain war dogs. - That'll all keep until after dinner, young man. - Ah, heck, you don't show the right respect for a war dog. Hey, wait a minute. Sit. He did it!

First I'm gonna make Pudgie eat crow. - What do you mean eat crow? - What have I done? - What have I done, he says. You know at the station when he said Danny Boy didn't know me. - Well, he didn't act very much like he knew you. - Well, that was all put on, just like I said. Now, I'll show that Danny Boy does me. Up, boy. Now, heel. Sit. Now, stay. Okay, fellas, I bet you you can't make him come. - Come here, Danny Boy. - Come here, Boy! (boys whistling) - Come here, Boy! - Wait just a minute. Just watch. Come here, Boy. Atta boy! I guess that shows Pudgie how you and I stand, huh? - I guess I was wrong, fellas, and I apologize. - Okay, Danny Boy and I accept your apology. Now, I want to show you what the government thinks of Danny Boy. Here, Rick, you read it. - "Dear sir, enclosed is an honorable discharge certificate for your dog, Danny Boy, now allowed to you. Also, a certificate of appreciation from the commandant." - Not, commandant, commandant. - "From the commandant of the United States Marine Corps." - Not corpse, corps. (kid laughing) - Corps. "For the services rendered to the war effort by you and your dog." - Say, Ricky, show them the certificate appreciation. - Oh, boy! Lookie, fellas! - Ooh, man! - Man! Good boy! - "In addition to this certificate there is a citation for the dog's faithful and courageous performance under enemy fire." - You know somethin' fellas? Boy practically won the whole Battle of Iwo Jima single handed. - Gee! No wonder they gave him a citation. - I'll say because he killed more Japs than Joe did. Up, Boy. Hey, fellas! How about a swim? Let's go! (boys cheering) (soft music) Boy went ahead of us. - Last one in is a big sissy. (kids chattering) (suspenseful music) - Darn you! How often must I tell you kids and your dogs to keep off my lawn. I won't stand for it, I tell you. Can't you see what it says on that sign? - Yes, Mr. Andrews, but I didn't mean to get on your lawn. I was only going after our ball. - Well, that's no excuse. You don't have to let the ball come on my property. - That's it fella. Lookie, fellas! He brought the ball back to me like he used to. Oh, your memory is coming back isn't it Boy? Aw, that's a good fella. Now, watch out. I want to hit it harder. Watch out now. Here comes a hot one, boys! (ball thuds) (whistle sliding) (tense music) (glass shattering) - Who did that? Who broke my window? This is the last straw. See what you young hoodlums did? You broke my window. Which one of you did it? - Mr. Andrews. They didn't do it. I did it. And I'm awful sorry, Mr. Andrews. I didn't mean to break your window. It was an accident. - I might have known it would be you. You're the leader of these hoodlums. I ought to thrash you within an inch of your life. - Wait a minute there. I wouldn't try that if I were you. Not while I'm around. - If he's my boy, I'd whoop him. - But he doesn't happen to be your boy. And that makes a great deal of difference. - You're not in the mornings now, Joe Cameron. - You better mind your own business. - Maybe I'll make this my business. - All right, Jimmy boy, what's all the squawk about? - Well, I batted out a fly. And it accidentally broke his window. - Is that all? Well, what are you worrying about? I'll pay for it. How much will it cost for a new window? - Thanks just the same, Joe, but it was my fault. - Where do you get that your fault? You mean our fault. We'll all chip in and pay for it won't we fellas? - [Boys] Sure! - Well, it'll cost ya $8.00 or $9.00. - So what? They said they'll pay for it. I'll guarantee they will. You just have the window fixed and send the bill to Jimmy. - So long boys, I got to get back to work. - [Boys] So long, Joe! - Mr. Andrews. - Yeah. - Can we have our ball back? - Your ball? No, you can't. I'm keeping that as security until you pay for the window. And hereafter all you boys keep off my premises. Or I'll have you arrested for trespassing! And you'd better keep that dog tied up before he bites somebody. - Well, it looks like we got to put together the price of a new window. - Yeah, where are we gonna get nine bucks? That's almost $2.00 a piece. - Well, I have $0.11. - I've got a nickel. - I am flat broke. - I've got an idea fellas. (kids chattering) Come on over to my house. And let's talk things over. - Here you are folks! Here's where you get that ice-cold lemonade. You need something cold on a hot day like this. And this is where to get it. You asked me if it's good. It's terrific. (indistinct) - Well, this is Donna. We'll take two glasses of your lemonade. - A big glass for only $0.05! - Is it good? - Mhm! - Say! If they say so, it's all right! Get your ice-cold lemonade right here! Ice-cold lemonade! A big glass for only $0.05! - Take care of the place. - Okay, Jimmy. - Come on Boy, quick. - Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold lemonade! Ice-cold lemonade! Only $0.05 a glass. Ice-cold lemonade! - Hello Jimmy. - Hi. How we doin'? - We've taken in $0.65. What's your take? - [Jimmy] $0.80. - Nice goin'! - Yeah. - Bye, Ricky. - Goodbye. - [Girls] Goodbye Jimmy. - Bye. - Hey, Jimmy! I've got to have more lemonade. I sold out what I had. - Sold out? Gosh! How did you do it? - I put up my stand in the front of the house. - Okay, you just go around in the back yard. Mom will fill up the bucket. - Okay. (bell ringing) - Yoohoo! Come on Jacky. Back you go. You'll have to stay in the house. Mommy will be right back. - How do you do Mrs. Johnson? - Hello. - Could I interest you in a pail today. - No, that's too many. I'll just take a sack full. - Mommy, doggy. - Hi, Jacky. - Hiya there Jacky. - Hello, Jacky. - Wanna pet Danny Boy. Come here. Come on and love him. Go ahead, love him. Love him. Ahh! - Say hello, Danny Boy. - Oh, isn't that cute. - Hey Danny Boy. - There. - Thank you. - That'll be $0.50. Thank you. I'll be back again next week. - Fine. (soft music) - Doggy, doggy, doggy. (laughs) - Jacky! (tense music) How dare you let that war dog run loose? He might have killed little Jacky. - Oh, no, Mrs. Johnson. Danny Boy wouldn't hurt Jacky. He likes him. - Sure he does, Mrs. Johnson. Don't you see how he was kissing Jacky? - If I hadn't come running, he might have hurt Jacky. This is no place for a war dog. He ought to be out in the country somewhere. - I warned you what could happen if that war dog wasn't tied up. - Did he bite Jacky? - [Boys] No! - He didn't hurt Jacky at all. - Are you disappointed, mister? - Well, you can be mighty thankful he didn't hurt Jacky. There's no telling when he'll turn on somebody. That's a dangerous dog. - I'm awful sorry you got so scared, Mrs. Johnson. But Danny Boy wouldn't hurt Jacky. Honest, he wouldn't. And if you don't believe me, I'll get the letter from the War Department. - I believe you Jimmy. If I hadn't listened to Mr. Andrews, I would've been so frightened. But he's been telling me your dog is dangerous. - Yeah, he hates Danny Boy. - I know. He even wanted me to get up a petition in the neighborhood to send Danny Boy away. - What? - Old Grumpy's got a heck of a nerve trying to take Danny Boy away from you. - I'll say. A fellas got a right to have a dog if he wants to. - Sure, you've got as much right to have a dog as he has to have canaries. - Gosh, I didn't think he was as mean as all of that. - He's the meanest man in the world, I'll betcha. - Better be awful careful, Jimmy. A mean guy like that is liable to poison Danny Boy. - That's right. He's mean enough to do anything. - He better not try to hurt my dog. No sir, nobody is gonna hurt you Boy, not while I'm around. And nobody's gonna get a chance to take you away from me either. No, sir. Lookie fellas! He kissed me again! - Yeah! - Gee! - Joe was right. He's come out of the fog completely. I'm gonna go tell mom. Come on Boy, heel. Come on fella. Mom! Mom! - What, dear? - He licked me, Mom. Come here, Boy. Show mom. Come on. Give me a kiss, Boy. Come on. Give me a kiss. See mom? - See what dear? - He's his old self again and remembers me and everything that he used to. See if he'll give you a kiss. - Have you got a kiss for me, Boy? (laughs) Oh, nice Boy. You really do recognize us, don't you? (Danny Boy barking) - He's tryin' to tell us he remembers everything. (Danny Boy barking) (suspenseful music) - Say, that's a fine looking dog over there. - He's a pain in the neck to me. You can have him. - I wish I could. (Danny Boy barking) I could use a good dog like him on my ranch. - You could, eh? (Danny Boy barking) (suspenseful music) - Well, I guess we better get back on the job. Okay, come on, Boy. Come on, fella. Come on. Come on. - Would you really like to have that dog? - Yeah, I sure would if they don't want too much for him. - Oh, he's not for sale exactly. But if you want him, I can get him for you. - Yeah? How are you gonna do it? - Come back here about 10 o'clock. (soft suspenseful music) - Well, have you decided to be a good dog? Because if you have, I've got somethin' nice for you. See? (Danny Boy barking) If that's the way you feel about it, you ain't gonna get nothing to eat. (Danny Boy barking) Shut up! Shut up, or I'll come back and beat you within an inch of your life. (Danny Boy barking) (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) (Danny Boy barking) (Danny Boy barking) (soft music) (water splashing) (soft music continues) (Danny Boy whining) - Hey, Jimmy, you want us to go up and help you when you pay ole Grumpy off? - Naw, I can handle it fellas. - Okay. I'll see you tomorrow morning. - Yeah, goodbye. - Bye, Jimmy. - Well, Jimmy, what's on your mind? - Well, I want to pay for the window. Have you got the bill ready? - Ooh, yes, but you didn't have to be in such a hurry to pay me. I know your word's good. But there we are. $9.00 even, see? - Okay. It's $5, and one, $6, one, $7, and one is $8. Two halves make $9. - (chuckles) Right you are. And I want to commend you for being an honest boy. - Just give me the receipt for the $9 please. - Oh, yes, yes. Always take a receipt. There you are. - Thanks. Now can we have our ball? - There's your ball. And don't break anymore of my windows. - Don't worry. I won't, Mr. Andrews. (soft music) Danny Boy! Welcome home. Mom! Mom! Come here quick! Danny Boy, gosh am I glad to see you. I thought you was never comin' home. (Danny Boy whimpering) What's the matter, Boy? Do you feel bad? Do you have pain? (Danny Boy whimpering) Well, what did they do to my Boy? - Where are you, Jimmy? - I'm in the dog house, mom. Come here, quick. Danny Boy's home. Look, mom. - Why, someone's been abusing him. Look at those awful welts on his body. - And he's so weak he can't even lift his head. And look at his poor paws. They're all bloody. - That must be because he's traveled a long way to get home. You're right, Jimmy. He didn't stray away. Somebody stole him. - Boy, would I like to know who did it. I'd have him arrested. That's what I'd do. - That would be too easy on him, dear. Now, you stay here. And I'll go get a doctor. - A doctor? Do you think he's hurt bad? Mom, do you think he's liable to die? - Now, don't jump to conclusions, dear. We don't know. But the veterinarian will. And he'll know just what to do. - Well, hurry mom, please hurry. (Danny Boy whimpering) It's all right, Boy. The vet's gonna come over and doctor ya. He'll fix ya up fine. And nobody's gonna get a chance to steal you again because you're gonna sleep on the foot of my bed. Oh, Boy. See, the doc is saving Danny Boy's life when he was hurt so bad. - I'll say. And he stayed up all night for three nights to save him. - Three nights! Gee wilikers! - Jeepers! - Gee, wouldn't you like to know who kidnapped him? - Would I? I hope Danny Boy bit him good and hard while he was making his escape. - You can say that again. - Hey fellas, pretty soon he'll be well enough to go on another camping trip. - Gee, that would be swell. - Won't it though? - Yeah. (Danny Boy barking) (tense music) - What's the matter, Boy? (Danny Boy barking) Danny Boy! Danny Boy, come here! (man yelling) - Oh! Help! Jimmy, that dog is killing me! Help me! - Danny Boy! - Help me, somebody. The dog is killing me! Help me! (tense music continues) - Come here, Danny Boy! - Get away from him so I can shoot! Pull away and I'll shoot him. - Watch out, fellas! Come here, Danny Boy! Danny Boy! Danny Boy! Down! (Danny Boy barking) (Danny Boy growling) I'm awful sorry, Mr. Andrews. I don't know why Danny Boy attacked you and the orange man. I guess he thought he was fightin' Japs again. - I told you that war dog would go mad and bite somebody. But that's the last time he'll bite anyone. I'm gonna call the police. (Danny Boy barking) - Why did you do it, Boy? Now you've got us in a lot of trouble. They're liable to put you and me in jail. - Come here! - Jimmy, come here! - What do you want? - You've got to get Danny Boy out of here fast before the cops arrive. - Yeah, they're liable to shoot him. - You can say that again. - Listen fellas, the police come lookin' for me, you don't know where I am, see? - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay, Jimmy. - Come on Boy. - Bye Jimmy! (fast-paced music) - We got to get out of here Boy! (siren blaring) The police, Boy! They're after us. Come here, quick! Down, Boy! Down! Down! (siren blaring) Coast is clear. Come on, Boy, quick. Come on, Boy. Hey Joe! - Hey, what are you doing in there? - Hidin'. The police are looking for me. - Hmm? The police aren't looking for you. - Yes, they are, honest. I need your advice. - What have you done that the police should be looking for you? - Danny Boy bit Grumpy Andrews and the orange man, and I mean, bit 'em. - What did they do to him? - Nothing, he just sprang over the fence and started to choke the orange man. And Grumpy tried to shoot him. And he took a bite out of him too. - He went after the orange man for no reason at all? - I guess he thought he was fightin' Japs again. - Yeah, something like that. - Well, what am I gonna do, Joe? Can you hide Boy here? Or maybe at your house? - Look Jimmy, I'd go all the way for a pal like you. But hiding Danny Boy isn't the right thing to do. - Yeah, but Grumpy called him a mad dog. The police are liable to shoot him. - No, they won't. Not on his say so. You're not mad at anybody are you, Boy? You wouldn't try to hurt anybody that was kind to ya? Of course not. - I don't care about myself, Joe. They can arrest me if they want to, just so they don't hurt Boy. - They're not gonna arrest you, Jimmy. And they're not gonna hurt Boy. That is if you get right him down to the police station. - They won't? - Of course not. But you must understand he's in a serious jam. Andrews may try to prove he's too dangerous to have around. - Yeah, and they're liable to take him away from me? - They may try to. We're not gonna let them. We'll get a good lawyer to defend him. - Do you know of a good dog lawyer? - You leave that to me. I'll get in touch with one while you're taking Danny Boy down to the police station. - Gee, but you're a swell pal, Joe. - All right, Jimmy, you better get going. - Okay. Come on, Boy. Hello, mister. - What can I do for you, sonny? - Is this the place where you turn in fugitives? - Yeah, this is the place. - And who is the fugitive, you? - No, him. The police are out lookin' for him right now. Up, Boy. - Ole fella, so you're a fugitive, eh? What are the charges against him, sonny? - I don't know. But he bit a couple of guys. - Bit a couple of guys? Is that so? Wait until I take a look at the blotter here. Hmm, don't see anything against him. Who did you say he bit? - An orange man. I don't know his name, old Grumpy Andrews. - Andrews, eh? Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Well, here it is. Here it is. A pick up order sent out for a four-year-old brown and black police dog. So you're Danny Boy, eh? "Use extreme care in capturing this animal as he is a war dog and believed to be vicious." - He's not so vicious. - "Complaint signed by Frank Andrews and Lafe Dunkell." I don't think he's vicious either, sonny. But I've got to lock him up just the same. Orders is orders, you know? - Yeah, but you'll take good care of him, won't ya? - Ah, you bet I will. You know I got a dog of me own. And I think I'm just about as fond of him as you are of Danny Boy here. - That's swell. Down, Boy. (soft music) Goodbye, Boy. Now be a good dog while I'm gone. And don't worry because Joe's gonna get ya a good lawyer and get ya out of here. Bye, Boy. - I have listened to the testimony in this case with an open mind and without prejudice because the defense conceded that the defendant dog had bitten the two plaintiffs in this action. But the main issue in this case is whether or not this dog is liable to repeat such attacks on other persons, whether or not he would be a menace to human life in the community. I cannot help but acclaim this dog's heroic service to our country. But such a service becomes a duty. No matter how valiantly such duty be performed it earns no special license to breach the laws which govern the safety and well-being of all the people. It has been shown in this court that the defendant dog is emotionally unstable, twice attacking citizens without any provocation. Therefore, I have no other recourse than to remove this menace to public safety. It is the order of this court that the defendant dog be taken to the city pound and put to death in the gas chamber. - No! No you can't do that to my dog. Please! (gavel thuds) - Order! (Jimmy crying) - Your Honor, please. - Yes, Mr. Cameron. - I'd like to ask you a favor, Your Honor. - You may proceed. - I'd like to remind your honor that Danny Boy is a hero and a Marine. As such, it would be a disgrace for him to die in the gas chamber. - Your point is well taken, Mr. Cameron. What do you propose? - Well, if a Marine has to die, I think he'd prefer the firing squad. So with your permission I'd like to carry out the sentence of the court. I think the dog would like it better that way if I... - I agree with you, Mr. Cameron, and rescind my previous order. I will release the defendant dog into your custody. And you will execute the order of this court. - Thank you, Your Honor. (Jimmy crying) Come on, pal. You and the Boy and I are going home. - Come on, Boy. - Do you think Cameron can be trusted to carry out the judge's sentence? How would we know? - Maybe you'd like to witness the dog's execution. If you would, I'll make arrangements with the judge. - No, no. I just want to be sure there'd be no miscarriage of justice. That's all. - Don't worry, Mr. Andrews. Nothing is gonna cheat you out of the pleasure getting even with a dog. (tense music) - I never ask for much. But this time I'm asking you for a special favor. Will you fix things so that Danny Boy can escape? He's too nice of a dog to have to die for something that he didn't mean to do. And if you let him escape, I'm sure he'll find another home someplace where people will like him. Will you do this for me? Please. Please. Goodbye, Boy. You're the best dog in the world. And I'm never gonna have another dog because no other dog can take your place with me. (Danny Boy whimpering) Up, come on. Here you go. Danny Boy. Danny! (crying) (Danny Boy barking) - Hey, ole boy, you're to stay with me. (Danny Boy barking) (engine rumbling) (soft music continues) (Jimmy sobbing) (soft music continues) - Jimmy! Hey Jimmy! - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey, Jimmy. - What do you want? - Look what we found. - In the orange man's barn. - Yeah, look, this is the rope that Danny Boy was tied up with. And this is the whip that the orange man beat him with. - Don't you see? Boy wouldn't have bit the orange man if he hadn't kidnapped him and abused him. - Sure! That's why he bit ole Grumpy too I betcha because Grumpy helped kidnap him. - Come on, Jimmy. Let's show the judge what we found. He'll do somethin' about it. I know he will. - It's too late, fellas. Joe's already taken Boy away to shoot him. - How long ago? - About 15 minutes ago. - Maybe we can catch him on our bicycles. - Sure we can. Do you know where he was goin'? - Joe Cameron's woods. - Listen fellas, if we want to save Danny Boy, we got to ride like the wind. Come on let's go! - Come on let's go! - Let's go! (soft music) - Come on Jimmy, let's go. - Come on, Jimmy. (soft music continues) - Come on, Boy. Come on, Boy, heel. (kid chattering) - Hey, Danny Boy. - Hello, Joe. - Hello, folks. - You goin' huntin'? - Ed, Ed, what an awful thing to say. Poor Joe has to kill little Jimmy's dog. - Oh. - Doggy, doggy. - Hey, come back here young fella. (baby chattering) - Happy landing devil dog and forgive me. (somber music) I'd give my right arm if I could get out of doin' this, Boy. But I couldn't let a Marine hero die like a common criminal. Besides, you and Jimmy are my friends. You understand, don't you, pal? Come on, Boy. Here, Boy. - Turn at the next crossroads, fellas, hurry! - It's no use killin' us, Jimmy. We'll never make it. - You can turn back if you wanna. But I've got to keep goin'! (suspenseful music) - Jacky! Jacky! (soft music) - Lookie, fellas! Here's Joe's car. - [Kids] Hey, Joe! - [Jimmy] Come on. (train chugging) (engine rumbling) - Go get him, Boy. Go get him! Go on, Boy. (train engine rumbling) - Jacky! Jacky! No! No! (train clattering) - Look, Danny Boy saved little Jacky. - Joe! Hey, Joe! - Ruthie. Ruthie. Ruthie, darling. - Jacky. Ed, where's Jacky! - He's all right, darling. - Lookie, fellas, there's Joe and Boy, come on! (Jacky laughing) - Come on. Here's Jacky, Mrs. Johnson. - Oh, Jacky, darling. Jacky, darling. Oh. - Oh, Danny Boy. You're a real for sure hero now. - I'll say he is. - Good thing for us you didn't pull the trigger before this happened. You can't go through with it now, Joe. Wait 'til I tell Judge Carter a thing or to. - Wait 'til we tell Judge Carter a few things or two. - [Kids] Yeah. - Look Joe, the fellas found that in the orange man's barn. - Well, that settles it boys. Come on, we're gonna see Judge Carter. - Come on, Boy. - Looks like someone else had things planned otherwise, Judge. - It does seem as if a higher authority than mine has decided this case. Therefore, I'm revoking my verdict. Danny Boy, you may go home with Jimmy now. And I'm issuing a bench warrant for the arrest of Lafe Duckell and Frank Andrews. - That's one pitch we won't miss. - You can say that again. - All right, that's one pitch we won't miss, eh fellas? (all laughing) - You're free, Boy! Free! Ain't it swell? Now, you ought to thank Judge Carter. Go ahead, Boy. Tell him. (Danny Boy whimpering) - [All] Aww. (emotional orchestral music)
