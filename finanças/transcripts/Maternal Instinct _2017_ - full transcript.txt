Can you hear me? [ radio ] Officer, can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you. [ radio ] I'm not feeling good about this. Relax. Just take a deep breath. You're doing fine. As soon as we give him the cash, we got him. Remember our deal. You blow away any jail time on me. Yeah. Deal is done when you deliver. Just keep it together. Looks like the day ended up nice. [ clears throat ] [ exhales ] Ok. I'm lost. Is it left or right up here? Sarah? What, mom? The mall, is it right or left? I think you passed it already. That's why everyone else in the world uses a GPS. Hey. I've been driving long before GPS was ever a thing. We've been here for two weeks already. The mall turn is back there. Well, being the tech genius, you could have told me sooner. Mom, you're totally lost. Turn around. We have to get back to the main road. Did I ever tell you you're a bossy little daughter? All the time, mom. I think we can go this way. No, mom, don't turn. Go straight. Who's driving? Me or you? Someone's coming. I've never seen him before. Stay cool. Don't do anything stupid. Are you Riley? Where's Alexi? I thought I was meeting Alexi. Alexi sent me. I got- I got the money. It's a little late. Late? What- what do you mean? My boss is annoyed. Wants me to make an example of you. Just give him the cash and get out of there. Hey, just- just take the money. I mean- I don't want any trouble. Too late. Hey. Hey! [ gun shots ] Dammit! Mom? Mom? Mom? Oh my god. Mom, he's got a gun! Sarah, get down. Get- get down! [ gun shot ] [ shatters ] Sarah, get down! Mom! [ gun shot ] [ screaming ] [ gun shot ] [ shatters ] Mom! [ screeching wheels ] [ gun shot ] [ sobbing ] Mom! [ gun shots ] [ sobbing ] Mom! [ sobbing ] [ tires screeching ] [ gun shot ] [ groans ] Go! Go! Freeze! [ gun shots ] [ car peels out ] [ gun shots ] [ screaming inside van ] Help us!!! Mom! [ sobbing ] Please help us! I need an ambulance, the back of Wharf Street. [ sobbing ] Please help us! [ sirens approaching ] Mom! Get an O.R. ready! Mom! Parker. What the hell happened? I don't know, Captain. Things got out of control. Please, mom. [ sobbing ] What's the girl's name? Sarah Walker, mother's name is Leigh. Get a trauma team ready! I got a good look at the shooter. And? Staltzy. You can't come back here. [ sobbing ] Is my mom dead? They're helping her. I wanna see her. The best thing you can do for your mom is be brave. Can you do that? I'm scared. Your mom is being taken care of by the best doctors. Look, take my car, bring her to the station. I'll meet you there shortly. Why don't you come with me and I'll take you to see her later. I don't wanna go. Please, I don't wanna leave my mom. We have to go, Sarah. I promise, everything's being done for her. No. Her mother's not getting out of the hospital any time soon. Yeah, I can't. Her father's deceased. I already told you. They just moved here. There's no relatives. Child Services. Just send someone to pick her up. She's your responsibility. She needs help. Is that your dad? He passed away when I was little. My dad died a couple years ago, too. Still miss him? Every day. Is my mom gonna be ok? Look. Your mom is in the hospital and the doctors are taking really good care of her. And soon someone will come and take care of you. No. No. I wanna stay with you, please. Parker. I'll be back. Internal Affairs is gonna wanna interview you about the shooting. I'll have the incident report on your desk before I leave tonight. How're you holding up? Ain't it great? I lost an informant, I got a mother in hospital, two bullets in her chest, fighting for her life. How's the kid? Scared. Worried. Probably in shock. Child Services is on its way. One of my kids is about the same age as her. I spoke to the DA. He's gonna want more than your I.D. of the shooter. Hayden Staltzy makes the Teflon Don look like a rookie. Nothing sticks to this guy. He'll have ten witnesses say that he was in a different state at the time of the murder. The kid might have got a good look at the shooter. Set a photo line up. See if she pics out Hayden. And if she does pick his photo along with my testimony that's gotta be enough for the District Attorney to get it to a grand jury. Let's find out. I'm gonna show you some pictures and if you can identify the shooter point to him. That's him. You're absolutely sure? Hayden Staltzy. We got the bastard, but we gotta be careful. This is no low-life. He's Alexi Vorkof's main hitman, and suspect in several homicides. Worst of the worst. Horton? Yeah? Come here. What's up, Captain? I want you to put out an APB on Hayden Staltzy. Approach with extreme caution, suspect is armed. Done. This the witness? Yeah. See that nice woman over there? She's gonna take you to a safe place. No, I'm not going. You promised that you'd take me to my mom. You can't leave me now. I think we can arrange for Officer Parker to stay with you for a little while longer. Thank you. I'll let Wallace know we don't need her this evening. Captain. I have an incident report to file and a psycho terrorizing the city. She should go with Child Services. Well, I disagree. I don't like kids. They don't normally like me, either. Child Services has a bed waiting. That little girl trusts you, Parker. If she saw the shooter then her life is in danger. You know Staltzy. His MO is making sure people can't I.D. him. He makes witnesses disappear. I'm not gonna leave that girl at a shelter until I can arrange protection. Yeah, but you- Look. Just stay with her tonight. I'll arrange for a car to pick her up in the morning and take her to Child Services. Fine. One night. Thank you. Am I staying with you? Yeah. Just for the night. Well, then where? I don't know yet. We'll figure that out later. Let's get going. It's not big. Sorry. Have you been chasing him a while? You mean Staltzy? I've been after his boss for a couple of years. I'm gonna put him and the man who shot your mom away for a long time. So... when'd you move to Portland? Um, two weeks ago. From Idaho. That's a big change. What's wrong? [ inhales ] [ exhales ] You ok? I've got asthma. I'll be fine. Detective? Heather. When will I get to see my mom? As soon as she's allowed visitors you'll be the first in to see her. Come on. Let me show you your room. Why don't you settle in and I'll check on you in a bit. [ winces ] [ ringing ] Yeah? Tony, take a walk. We got a problem. The girl's staying with the cop. So we gotta get to her. Remember what I told you about that cop. She's mine. Tony, get in here. Is this your boyfriend? No. My brother. Did you always want to be a police officer? I was born into it, I guess. My dad was a cop and I always wanted to be like him. He used to call me his little detective. That him? Mmmhmm. My dad was in the army. He called me his number one soldier when I was just a little girl. The bad guy, is he- Halfway across the country by now. Don't worry. What's gonna happen to me? Nothing is gonna happen to you. One girl to another, you need to trust me. Can you do that? Good. Now, I need to finish my report and you need to go to bed. Goodnight. See you in the morning, Sarah. Kill the kid first and then bring the cop to me. I'll keep an eye out here. [ cocks gun ] I'll be in and out of there in less than a minute. [ gasps ] [ screaming ] [ gun shot ] [ shatters ] [ grunts ] [ groaning ] [ chuckles ] [ groans ] You bitch! This would've been so easy. But now you're gonna suffer. [ grunts ] Don't move! [ door opens ] That's him! That's the man who shot my mom! The man who shot my mom! [ gun shot ] [ groans ] You gotta get me to Tony, I'm hurt bad! [ gun shot ] He'll fix me up! No problem. [ gun shots ] [ starts engine ] [ peels away ] [ gun shots ] Are you ok? You're safe. Shh. You're safe, ok? Thanks, Ron. Yeah, she's with her now. Ok, will do. Thanks. Prints came back on the deceased. Luca Samporo got out of New York. Informants say he was brought in to help out while there was heat on Staltzy. Look, I blame myself for this. We got lucky, Parker. This night could have ended very differently. How did they know where we were? Come here. We think he has a rat in the police department. You're kidding me, right? I wish I was. I've added extra cops at the hospital to help protect the mother. Good. Any news with the mother? Doc says they've done all they can. It's now up to her will to live. I feel for the kid. Look, I called a colleague who runs a police department upstate. He's arranged for a safe house for her until we have Staltzy in custody. He's assigning a detective to help work with you. Does anyone else know about this? No. Look, we're gonna need a bigger team to help catch this guy. I'm giving you carte blanche. You let me know how many detectives you want working this case. See what you need and I'll arrange for it. [ knocking ] Detective Parker, Diane Wallace, Child Services. Detective Parker. That little girl thinks the world of you. You saved her life. She's a good kid. That's why I need you to convince her that she needs to come with me. Oh, sorry. Change of plans. The kid is staying in police protection in a safe place. You do realize that the girl's been traumatized and she's gonna need a lot of help. Not just protection. She needs to be with someone she trusts. We appreciate all you've done, but we'll handle it from here. Alright. I'm gonna need the paperwork on this one. Alright. Let me do it. You're already heading the investigation. No, I wanna protect Sarah. I wanna be in charge of the safe house. I don't think so. Look, I need your savvy to help catch this guy. It's out of the question. Yeah, we might catch this guy but if he gets to her first we have no case. You're the one who said he's beaten every charge against him by having no witnesses. Are you sure you wanna do this? Yeah. She trusts me. She feels safe with me. I'll make the call, get things set up. You're gonna stay with me. It's ok. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. How long will we have to hide? Until we catch the bad guy. What if you don't catch him? Honey, we're gonna catch him, and he's gonna go away for a very long time. Trust me. I promise you. Alright, this is it. Welcome to your new home. Hello, ladies. I'm Detective Lancaster. Detective Parker and this is Sarah. Hi, Sarah. Come on. I'll show you the place. [ alarm beeping ] Right, so the house has a security system connected directly to the station. Any issues, I'll know right away. Perfect. I'll let Nichols know. Great. Sarah, why don't I show you to your room? It's ok, Sarah. Detective Lancaster is here to protect you. Sarah, I know you're scared, alright? But I'm here to make sure that nothing happens to you. And you can just call me Travis if you'd like. [ ringing ] Nichols. Yeah, it's me. We're here. Ok. So this is where you'll be staying. Why don't you get settled in while I go talk to Detective Parker, ok? We are 150 miles away from Portland but it might as well just be two if you two use your real names while you're here. I'm listening. Captain has suggested that you two use aliases while you're here. Done. Alright, well for simplicity's sake Sarah will keep her first name. She's now Sarah Johnson. Ok, and who will I be? Just pick something that's easy and stick to it. Rachel. That was... well, it's my mom's name. Nice name. Now, I know you don't need to be reminded, but Sarah absolutely cannot contact friends or family while she's here and that comes directly from your boss. I know the routine. Right. You know, I checked you out. That's uh, quite the impressive resume. Awards. Marksmanship, valour. Thanks, Detective. We're a little less forma here. You can probably just call me Travis if you'd like. And you can call me Rachel. Previously known as Heather. Right. Rachel. Hey, Sarah. For the next little while we're gonna pretend to be someone else. So that the killer can't find us. That's right. So I'm going to be Rachel Johnson, your mother, and you're gonna be Sarah Johnson. Rachel and Sarah Johnson. And don't ever use our names or let people know why we're really here. Yes. And there are rules. What rules? Absolutely no texts, chats, phone calls, emails, games, anything online. But I have to check my computer. What if my mom tries to get a hold of me? Sarah, as soon as your mom is better they will let us know. I'll tell you what, little lady. I will personally check on your mom every day for you. How's that sound? Thank you. Ok, Sarah. Rachel here needs to know exactly where you are at all times, alright? If you see anything suspicious you tell her immediately or you call 911 and you ask for me. Any questions for the detective? Can I write my mom a get well card? Of course you can. And I'll make sure she gets it. Now, once the alarm is set don't open any doors or windows. If the alarm does sound it goes directly to me and I will be here as fast as possible, ok? She's a beautiful little girl. I really feel for her. I hope her mom pulls through. Yeah, me too. Thanks for everything, Travis. If there's anything I can help with, just call. Yeah. I will. Not much for food. We're gonna have to do some grocery shopping and make a list. That's what mom would say. What'd she say? Make a list and- [ doorbell rings ] Stay here. [ doorbell rings ] [ opens door ] I was wondering when someone was gonna move in here. I thought I'd be neighbourly and surprise you with a pie. That is very kind but I- I'm actually busy right now. I'll just drop this in the kitchen and get out of your way. Now, don't touch. It's far too hot. Home made apple pie. My name is Lois. I live across the street. Sarah, say hello to our new neighbour. Aw, are you shy? Just like my son was at your age. I bet you could give me a big smile. Give it a try. You have a beautiful daughter. Thank you. Uh, we have a lot to do here, so... Of course Jerry, my son, he's all grown up now. High school teacher in Portland. Nice wife, two young kids. Now, you let this cool and then dig in. I think you're gonna like this area. Real nice folks. Thank you, Lois. I didn't catch your name. I'm Rachel and this is my daughter, Sarah. Oh, well very nice to meet you. Now, if you wanna know anything about anybody around here just ask me. And if there's anything I can do to, um, help you with? Yeah, no, we're- we're pretty good. We just, uh, we're pretty tired from the long drive. Oh, long trip? Where'd you move from? Idaho. Idaho? Well, that is a long way. My mom got transferred here. Now, shouldn't you be in school, young lady? Sarah's homeschooled. Oh, interesting. Well, I'm never one to overstay a welcome so I'll just pop back later to get the dish. Bye. See ya. [ door opens, closes ] We need to talk. About? Never offer information. We need to be able to keep secrets about ourselves. I'm sorry. I know it's hard, but you need to be careful what you say. It's important. Can you do that? Can I have a piece of pie? Oregon? Huh. I thought she said Idaho. [ dialing ] [ ringing ] Yeah? Where are they? Are you crazy calling me at the station? You've got half the police force looking for you. I don't care about your problems. What I care about is where's the kid and where's the mother? I don't know. Only the Captain knows where they are. Well, that is not good enough, because I pay you a lot of money to keep me informed! Do you understand me? You need to trust me. I'm doing everything I can. Are you? Let me check Parker's computer, see if it's got any clues as to where they might have taken her. Do it. [ ringing ] Was that about my mom? Can I send my mom a text so when she wakes up she can be happy? I'm sorry, Sarah. No texts or phone calls just yet. Can you find out how she's doing? I can do that. It's been six days since my mom got hurt. I know, Sarah. Do you wanna do something? Hmm? Maybe we can go into town, get some groceries. Yeah. Why don't you go get ready and then we'll leave. [ video ] Mom, I miss you so much. I can't wait for you to get better and come home. Heather, a police detective, is taking care of me. You'll like her a lot. We're hiding until she can put the man who shot you in jail. Mom, I miss you so, so much and I can't wait for you to get better and come home. I love you. You ready? What if he's waiting for us? Sarah, I'll protect you. No one knows we're here. I read about him. Who, Staltzy? It said he murders any witnesses against him. Sarah, it's ok to be scared but I promise I won't let anything happen to you. What if I won't testify? Then he'll leave mom and I alone. Or I can just say I didn't get a good look at his face. Sarah. Sarah, listen to me. No one will make you testify if you don't want to. But Staltzy is a dangerous man and he won't stop trying even if you don't testify. Now, I know you're frightened and you're worried about your mom right now but I need you to stay focused on staying hidden until we catch him. You still wanna go? If not, it's ok. We can- No, I wanna go. We can- Ok. I will call Travis and let him know we'll go downtown. It's a little cold, huh? Why isn't Travis walking with us? He's doing his job and watching our backs. Well, hello. Lois. Thanks for the apple pie. It was delicious. You are so welcome. Now, Rachel, how are you settling in? Is there anything I can help with? No, thank you. So far, so good. Sarah. I want you to stop by my house later 'cause I've got a treat for you. Fudge squares. You are gonna love 'em. Is that ok, mom? Maybe not today, but another day, ok? Alrighty then. Well, don't be strangers. Drop by any time. Thank you, Lois. Everything alright? Yeah, she's just a neighbour from across the street. She's harmless. Alright, well we had everyone in the vicinity of the house checked out so there shouldn't be anything to be worried about. I wouldn't have expected less. I just got some news on your mom, little lady. Is she awake? Not quite yet. But I'm sure soon. Doctors are taking very, very good care of her. Thank you. Well, I'd say we're about done here, Sarah, so thanks for having our backs. Yeah. I'll be at the station if you need anything. See ya. So Sarah, tell me something about your mom. She loves animals. So do I. We used to go to the zoo all the time. And what's your favourite animal? Panda bear. They're pretty cute. I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to stop me from thinking about my mom. You're smarter than I thought. I'll never stop thinking about her. That's alright. What's going on? Just stay here. Stay here. What's going on? Hey! Get back! [ dog barks ] Just someone looking for their dog. I'm so scared. I know, I'm sorry. I'm afraid. It's ok. Let's get home. Ok? Ok. Ok, come on. Looking for me? Damn, Hayden, you scared me. And? Disappeared. Not a trace. You better tell me something I don't know. Listen, I think they're starting to get wise at the station. What is this? Flash drive with all the girl's info on it. Gaming accounts, email, Snap Chat. And the mother? ICU. You messed her up pretty bad. You need to listen to me. I gotta lay low for a while. They're starting to suspect something. We can't have complications. Yeah, yeah. Get outta here. [ gun shot ] [ gun shotS ] I don't like complications, either. What happens to me if my mom dies? Oh, sweetie. That's not gonna happen. You have to have hope, Sarah. I never saw my dad before he died. I'm never gonna see my mom again, am I? No. No, you have to have faith, Sarah. You have to believe your mom is gonna be fine and she's gonna come home. When your dad passed away, did you see him before he... Um... no. No, I had a case and... I didn't make it back on time. You understand then. My dad died a million miles away. I never got to say goodbye. I don't care what social workers say, or the police. I need to see my mom. I'm sorry, sweetie, but... I can't. [ sniffling ] I'm sorry. I didn't want to make you sad. It's ok, sweetie. Come here. Sometimes it just feels good to let things out. Dear mom, I pray for you every night and I can't wait to see you again. Heather is pretending to be my mom while we're hiding. She's doing great but not as great as you being a mom. She likes being a detective, I can tell. I miss you so much, mom. I love you. [ smash ] [ car alarm goes off ] Be quiet. Whatever you do, don't open this door or make a sound unless it's me. You understand? [ alarm sounding ] Broken glass out back. Where is she? She's safe upstairs. [ turns off alarm ] [ inhales ] Get down! Sarah, get down, now! Mom, he's got a gun! No! [ gun shot ] That's him! The man who shot my mom! Stay back! He's got a gun! [ shatters ] You can stand down. It's just a... bird flew into the window, set off the alarm. There's no intruder. Let's get Sarah. Sarah? I'll check the rest of the floor. [ sobbing ] Sweetie, come here. Come here. [ sobbing ] I thought it was him. I thought he was gonna kill us! It's ok. It wasn't him. I want my mommy! I know, I know, sweetie. [ sobbing ] I know. Shh. How's she doing? Asleep now, but I'm worried about her. She's been through a lot. Yeah. Here. Thanks. Yeah. So are you holding up alright? Are you asking because I'm a woman? No. I'm asking as one cop to another. Are you alright? Yeah. I'm fine. Sorry about that. Ah. So how'd you get to be the lucky guy assigned to protect me? I guess you don't know? Know what? Uh, my dad is the captain at our station and, uh, he went through the academy with Nichols so, you know, they sorta came through the ranks together? When Nichols needed someone he could trust, that was my dad and voila. Me. So our dads are both cops? There you go. We got something in common. [ laughs ] You married? No. You? Nah. I think men find female detectives intimidating. Well, not all men. If I'm not mistaken you're excluding yourself from that? Look, after this is all over maybe, uh, maybe a nice dinner, you and I. Sure. Yeah, I'd like that. Alright. I'll see you tomorrow. Travis? Thank you. For everything. [ opens, closes door ] [ alarm sounds ] Hey, go see what's going on! You stand up here. Hey, this room is restricted. No entry. It's protocol. We've gotta get these patients off of this floor. We have a fire in the building and oxygen tanks right next door that could explode. Ok, I'm gonna call this in. Let them know what's going on. Yeah, you do that. [ groans ] I don't care what he told you. You're a police officer. You're a cop, right? Think like a cop! [ muffled gun shots ] When I tell you to guard a room I want you to guard that room unless I tell you to leave. Dammit! I need a doctor! What's going on in here? Stay here. Don't leave. [ alarm continues ] Everybody down! I said everybody down! [ gun shot ] [ screaming ] Staltzy, don't move! [ gun shot ] Dammit! [ gun shots ] There's no way out, Staltzy! There's nowhere to go! [ gun shots ] [ gun shot ] [ car peels away ] How's she doing, doc? She was clinging to life before, now she's worse. The next 48 hours are gonna be critical. If she doesn't respond by then, it'll be time to take her off the ventilator. Keep me updated. No one goes in there but the doc and the nurses. [ dialing ] [ ringing ] Yeah, what's going on? We had an officer killed last night. Forensics is checking the ballistics to see if there's a connection to your case. Who is it? Horton. There's more. Staltzy got into the mother's room last night. Is- is she- No. But her condition is deteriorating. She may not make it now. Well, what about Staltzy? He gave us the slip. How bad is she? Doctors say if she doesn't improve in the next 48 hours they'll take her off ventilation. Ok, I'm gonna- I'm gonna take Sarah back to see her mother. No. No, it's too dangerous. This girl's just been through a lot. She lost her father without being able to say goodbye and now she's about to lose her mom. This isn't your call. Look, I'm ordering you to stay put. You understand? I- I don't care. This is crap and you know it. No, this is protecting a child and making a case. Don't do anything stupid. Yeah. [ ringing ] Detective. We might have a problem. [ knocking ] Hey. Come in. I uh, I wish this was a social visit but it's not. Travis? Why the visit? [ sighs ] Your boss, Nichols, called. Said you might have it in your head to do something off the grid. Her mother's in the hospital. I'm giving her the chance to see her mom for what might be the last time. If she doesn't see her mom before she dies, she's gonna be scarred for the rest of her life. Am I the only one who understands that? I've been ordered by Nichols to keep you here. Try. No, I guess that won't work, will it? Sarah needs to see her mother and I'm gonna make sure that happens. You will lose your badge. But that doesn't concern you. So, what? You gonna arrest me? Nothing will change your mind, will it? Nothing. Sarah? Sarah, I need to talk to you. [ knocks ] Sarah? She's not upstairs. I'll check downstairs. Sarah! She's not downstairs. Sarah? Sarah! She's not back there. Rachel! She's over here! Alright. Where is she? She's inside. I saw her standing in your yard so I waved her over and asked her to have some fudge. I hope that's alright. I'm Lois. Uh, Travis. Sarah? Sarah, what're you doing? Heather, I was just checking. Heather? I thought your name was Rachel? It is. Rachel is my middle name. Why didn't you tell me where you were? Look, this is completely my fault. I am so sorry if I upset you. No, no apologies necessary. I just... Sarah, we have to go. We have something important to do. Come on. Thank you, Lois. Don't ever disappear like that again, ok? You scared me. You wanna go somewhere you let me know. You understand? Sorry. [ cocks gun ] [ computer alert ] Gotcha. No, Sarah. Sarah, wait. She needs to see her mother. I'll do whatever it takes to get her there. I can't persuade you to change your mind? Baden Hospital, right? Yeah. Well, I guess you'll need back-up. I can't let you go alone. You ride in the back, we'll take my car. I'll get a nasty letter on my record, it's no big deal, but this could end your career you realize? I'm willing to take that chance. Then I'm with you. Thank you. You're a good man. A decent man. Let's go tell her. [ knocking ] Honey? Hey. We're gonna take you to see your mom. Thank you so much. If we're gonna do this we should get going. Let's go. Ok? Ok, we are driving through town now so from here on keep your heads down in the back. Staltzy's got eyes everywhere. We'll be at the hospital soon. Detective Parker. Which room can I find Gail Walker? Room 418. Just down that way and down the hall to the right. Great. Thanks. We got a few minutes 'til Nichols knows we're here. Let's see your mom. Mom! Mom, I love you so much. Please get better. Mom, this lady is Heather. I'm fine 'cause she's taking good care of me. You'd like her a lot, mom. She's a lot like you. I miss you every day. I can't wait for you to come home. [ beep changes ] She can hear. She can. Looks like Sarah's her strongest medicine. She's crying. Mom can hear me. What're you people doing here? My mom. My mom, she heard me. She knows I'm here. Detective Parker and this is Gail's daughter. I need to ask all of you to leave now. My mom, is she gonna be ok? I think your mom's gonna be alright. Did you hear that, mom? You're gonna be ok. But I really do need you all to leave now. We should go. Ok, sweetie. No, no, no, no. Please, please. I want to stay. I know. Please. Come on. [ sobbing ] I'll be back, mom, I promise. Please, I don't wanna leave my mom. Please. She squeezed my hand, I felt it. Thank you for taking me to see my mom. Happy to do it. Alright, you're all secure inside and out. Thank you, Travis. I'm heading back to the s- Oof. [ laughs ] I'll uh, I'll come back later tonight and check on you two. Perfect. I think he's coming back to see you. Anyone ever say you're wiser than your years? Yes, you and my mom. Mmmhmm. I'm gonna get you! [ squeals ] I'm gonna get you! [ gasps ] Where's the kid? Who are you? I need to know where the kid is. [ phone rings ] You're gonna answer it and you're gonna tell them you can't talk right now. Hello? I- I can't right now, Beverly. Not now, I'm busy. Thanks. Bye. Thank you. What do you want? Where's the kid? The one that used the computer. Sarah? Yeah. Sarah. And the cop. What cop? I- Don't play games with me. Where's the cop? I don't know what you're talking about. She is here with her mother. They- they moved in across the street. It's a little early for a visit. What's your name? Lois. Have a seat, Lois. [ ringing ] Hello? Dammit, Heather! What were you thinking? You couldn't leave well enough alone. I did what I morally had to do. You disobeyed a direct order. And now I can't protect you. Internal Affairs is involved. In the morning a new team will relieve you of your duties. Someone else will be responsible for Sarah. Don't do this, Nichols. If you spent time with the girl I guarantee you would have done the same thing. Yeah, maybe so, but I answer to others and now they want your head. I truly sympathize with you but it's out of my hands. You're a great detective, one of my best, and I'll be sure to make that point in my report. But I can't say what the final outcome will be. I'm very sorry. Yeah. Thanks, Nichols. What're you doing? [ laughs ] Wow, that's uh, that's beautiful. Thank you. I'm gonna give them to my mom when she's out of the hospital. I think that's a good idea. It's pretty cute. When this is all over can we still be friends? Yeah, I'd like that. Forever? Forever. Who's that one? That's Travis. I'm just kidding, I knew it's Travis. In his cowboy hat. [ laughing ] [ gasps ] Lois, I need you to do something for me. What? I need you to call Sarah and the cop and ask them to come over here. You're gonna kill them if I do that. I need you to do it now. [ whimpers ] You can do it. I can't call that little girl over here so that you can harm or kill her. I can't do it. You disappoint me, Lois. But I'm gonna give you one last chance to make that call. No. She's a beautiful little girl. I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to her. [ sighs ] So you're willing to die for someone you don't even know? [ whimpers ] You remind me of my mother, Lois. She hated me, too. She was the first person I killed. Do you know how I felt when I did it? [ whimpers ] I liked it. Goodbye, Lois. No, please, no! [ gun shot ] [ thump ] [ inhales ] [ exhales ] Heather, Travis is back! Ok, thanks! [ knocking ] Don't say a word. Move your hand away from your gun or I'll kill ya. [ knocking ] [ gasps ] Toss the gun. Where's the girl? She's not here. It's just us. You think I'm an idiot? Sarah? I know you can hear me. Come here now or I will hurt somebody. Sarah? I know that you can hear me. And if you come out right now I promise you no one will get hurt. I told you. She's not here. You have one more chance to tell me where that girl is. [ gun shots ] Travis! Travis! Travis! Where's the girl? Where. Is. The girl. Sarah? Sarah, if you can hear me, run! Sarah? Run now! If you don't come out I'm going to kill her. You have three seconds. Sarah, don't listen to him! Three. Don't. Two. Don't! One. I'm here! That's a good girl, Sarah. Come here. Come here. Don't you touch her. You have me, just let her go. Do you have any idea the thorn you have been in my side? I had to kill people. Including the little old lady across the street. Lois, no! Lois never did anything to you. You've been chasing me a long time. You know who I am. No witnesses, remember? [ gasping ] That's enough talking. [ gun shot ] [ groans ] Is that the best you got? [ struggling ] [ gasping ] [ groans ] Heather, look out! He's got a knife! [ grunting ] [ groans ] Just die! [ gun shot ] [ groans ] [ gun shots ] [ groans ] Is he... You're safe now. Travis! I thought we lost you. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. The vest saved my life. You're hit. It's just a through and through. Let's get you to a hospital. Yeah. Heather! Hey, little lady. I can't thank you enough. You saved my life. And my daughter's. He could be proud of her. Thank you for coming. Thanks for being my other mom. Someday when I have a little girl I hope she's just like you. Looks like things worked out well for them. Unfortunately not so much for you. Internal Affairs wants you off the force. Is that right? But I convinced them to give you a second chance considering you brought down Staltzy. Because of you this city's a much safer place. Uh, is there something I should know? I think I found a guy who understands me. Travis, do not let her fool you. I've worked along side her for six years. No one understands you. [ laughs ] Good luck. I'll see you tomorrow? Tomorrow. Are you trying to fool me? [ laughs ] Come here. [ laughs ] Let's go.
