Throw me the bag, then you can go back to sleep, OK? Bitch! We like a little teamwork around here, pal. You know, loners don't go too far in this outfit. Private! The colonel! Shit! I'll have the house ready for you in three weeks, Dad, OK? I love you. Take care. Bye. Hello there, Charley. Hi, ma'am. How are you? Just fine. Stay with the convoy till you get to town. You've lots of time to get to the airport. Of course, sir. Sergeant... You know how important she is to me. Yes, sir. She'll be safe with me, sir. Are you ready for the trip? Yep. Thank you.

Let go of me. ♫ Danger tune ♫ Who are they? What do you think I am, a jungle baby or something? Would you...? I can't go as fast as you. Don't you touch my shoes. I hope you're going to Italy to get me a pair of designer shoes. What are you... I can't believe you just did that. You are crazy, do you know that? These are my favorite shoes. How... What are you gonna do with that? What?! (Cutting the skirt) (Cutting the skirt) You, my dear, are going to town to buy me new shoes and a new skirt. Don't you touch my skirt! What... What...

Would you look at me? Look at my shirt. Look at my hair. It's a mess. Do you have a comb, by any chance? Comb. Course not. Shoes... Are you OK? Ahh.... My clothes are just a bit wet, thank you. Well, we can hang 'em out to dry. Are you serious? Alrighty, they should be dry pretty soon. Ah, haha. (Laughing) If my father saw us out here like this, he would absolutely kill you. Do you realize that? Oops. But... I kinda like it. Feels kinda natural, don't you think? It's gonna start getting dark. You know, Heh, I don't even know your name. Joe. That's it? Yeah, just call me Joe. Joe. (Bird singing) OK, Joe. Look, Ah... Colonel's gonna be worried you. We'd better... get dressed. and... get outta here. Ah? (Footsteps) (Door closed) I want every inch of that jungle covered before dark. Get every man on duty out in the field, NOW! Yes, sir! Third time this month we've been hit. 'Get on the horn' to the chief of police, and tell him to get his ass in gear. Sir! And your ass is in a sling, mister, if anything's happened to Patricia. We tried our best, sir. Obviously it wasn't good enough. Was it?! No, sir. What the hell happened out there? We've never had any casualties in these instances before. We wouldn't have had any this time either, sir. if that new man hadn't been along. Your daughter'd be here right now, safe, if he hadn't started acting like John Wayne. The son of a bitch is gonna be sorry he ever joined this goddamn army. Jackson! Yes, sir. Did you get a chance to check the wounds? Yes, sir. I did. What the hell did you find out? Have you ever heard of Ninjutsu, sir? What's that? The secret art of assassination. Yeah, of course I have. Well, according to witnesses' testimony and evidence... this massacre was the work of Ninjas. Ninjas? Yes, sir. You have served me well, my friend. Until today, your record was spotless. But the truck with the most valuable cargo, got away. Another incident like this, I might have to shut down the entire operation. An American figher appeared... He disappeared like a Ninja among my men. An American Ninja? What are you talking about. There is no such thing! I do not lie. I know it is death to teach the secrets to the westerner... but I also know there was an American ninja there. The buyers arrive tomorrow. It's a multimillion-dollar deal. Nothing must be left to chance. This American, whatever he is, get rid of him. (truck stops) I guess it's goodbye. Guess so. Heh. Well... Bye. Goodbye. Heh... Look at me! Don't I look absolutely ridiculous? No, you look good. Thank you. Well... Bye. Joe! Thanks. Thanks for everything. (Truck drives away) I suppose you think you're a hero, because you brought my daughter back alive. No, sir. Well, good. Because I've got half a mind to throw you under the stockade. Just what in the hell were you tryin' to prove out there, private? Nothing, sir. We've got a touchy situation with these rebels. We're under standing orders not to provoke any incidents. There was nothing in that convoy worth protecting. Now we've got four dead men on our hands. There's gonna be an investigation. You're gonna be court-martialled, and I can't help ya. Get outta my sight. (Secretary typing on a typing machine) Do you have his record, Sergeant? Yes, sir. Well, let's hear it. Yes, sir. Date of birth? Unknown. Parents, Unknown. Next of kin? Unknown A construction crew found him on an island six years ago... knocked unconscious by an explosion, where they were blasting a road through the jungle. Brought back to the United States with total amnesia. In and out of foster homes. Hell, he's got more last names than I could count. Here it is. I knew it. Age 16, in reform school for almost killing a man. That's correct, sir. Six months ago he got in trouble again. Judge gave him a choice: Enlist or go to jail. Confine him to base till we finish the investigation. Yes, sir. And keep him away from Patricia. Yes, sir. All right, men. I know our morale is low, so, now let's just go hit the showers, OK? That's him, man. There's that bastard I was telling you about. Let's go. (Locker slammed) Hey, Joe-Hero. Did you.. uhm, make out with the princess? Did she, Ah... put out a little bit to thank you for saving her life? Let's get outta here. This place stinks. (Soldiers agrees) Four bodies to impress a girl. It's a heavy price, wasn't it? WASN'T IT? (Door slamed) (Open the car's door) Bienvenido. Hola, amigo Ortega. Ha ha ha.... Welcome to the Ortega estate. Thank you very much. Welcome. Come in, please. Not bad, eh? Hi. Janette. Enchanté. Juliette. Very nice to meet you. What beautiful things you have here in your palace. But, it's creepy all of this, right? Everything that you see here. it all belongs to me. We are totally autonomous here. We grow our own food, train our staff... and store our product until the right buyers... such as yourselves, can take delivery. Very impressive. This way. This is Shinyuki. He's responsible for the, beautiful landscape you see around you. I found him when I bought the estate. He was hiding in the jungle. in uniform, a Japanese soldier, who was unaware for years that the war was over. He never says a word. Well, hardly ever. But as you can see, he is truly an artist. (Drum beat) Ahh... Very impressive. Climb. One. Two. Three. (Ninjas training) Eiiyahh... Eiiyahh... This is my private army. In addition to ensuring safe acquisition and delivery of the merchandise... each member of my special duty staff here, is ah... specially trained to... How should we say it, ah... help you with any problems you may encounter with the opposition. The results are quite efficient, and final. (Thump) (wakt) Heeyooo... (whack) (Thump) (Pyesh) (Pyesh) Eyah.... (Pyesh) Aya! (Kyesh) (Pyesh) (Thump) Ayesh... Aiyah... Aiyah... Aiyah... (Sound of sticks hitting) Aiyah. Aiyah... (Thump) Ashhh... Ugh... (Ninja suffucates) (Breaking the neck) Black Star Ninja. is the only top-ranking, ninjutsu sensei outside Japan. Believe me when I tell you this man is deeply honored to die at his hands. This way, please. You have an excellent inventory. It's all straight from the factory. I don't deal in used equipment. You'll find only the best here. But items which are most valuable to us, you still don't have. Do you think you can comply with our needs? I'm expecting the final items in the next few days. If we can agree on a price, it can be included in the next shipment. Three million for everything. There are other buyers also interested. The equipment is quite complete. We can pay four million. Cash on delivery. But of course. It's a pleasure doing business with you, my friend, and you. pleasure. pleasure. And now for some champagne. Ohh.... (Door closes) (Soldiers singing the morning drill) Heyhoo. Heyhoo! Heyhoo. Heyhoo. Hey ho! Ho. Ho, ho. (Footsteps) Hey! So you're the new driver, ah? I hear you think yourself to be some kind of a tough guy. A karate boy. Hey, I'm talkin' to you, hero. Yeah, he thinks he's a real bad-ass, Jackson. (Putting down the wrench) I think you should teach him a lesson there, ace. Bad-ass? You know, every place you go, there's someone who thinks he's a bad-ass, right?. (Soldiers agrees) Then there are those few who are. He ain't one of 'em. Are you some kind of a bad-ass, karate boy? Because from what I heard, you didn't act like one the other day. And we lost some good friends because of it, ah? We like to know where a person stands, ah? We pride ourselves on teamwork on this base. We left all the glory boys back in Vietnam. Because glory boys like you get people killed. You understand what I'm sayin'? Yeah, you understand what I'm sayin'. (Throwing wrench) So let's go, bad-ass. Let's see what kind of stuff you're made out of. (Kicking the wrench) He he he. Don't push it. (Solders heating up) Very good. I've touched somethin'. Let's go. I'm talkin' to you, Mr. Hero. OK! All right, let's do it. Come on, baby. Come on, fight me. Who the fuck are you? Come here! Come on, fight me, man. Solders: Ohh.... Solder: Jackson!... Solders: Com'on fight back. Solders: He can't get away with that! Solder: Com'on. Oh.. Ohhh... Whoa! Shut up! Hey. Hey! Ugh... (Solders shouting) Solder: Whoa.... Hey! Hey! We don't stop till one of us goes down. Now. Let's go. (Soldiers heat up) Com'on, what are you gonna do with that hose, ah? go play with yourself? Com'on! Show me what you do. (Soldiers shouting) Argh.... Solder: Jackson, get up. Solder: Stay down. (Ufff...) Solder: Here. Go and get him with this. You damn right I'll get him. Solders: Yeah! Yeah! What's this? Time to mess him up now. What is this? He can't even see you. (Solders laughing) Eiyah... Ah... All right, all right, all right. Hey. I'm Jackson. Joe. Curtis Jackson is man enough to admit when he's wrong. Joe's all right, right? Solders: Right. Ain't this a bitch? You know, I've been instructing martial arts in the army for many years now, you've got some sharp moves. Who'd you study with? Nobody. I just picked up a few things here and there, in the streets. In the street.. Well, look, uhm, thanks for the demonstration, Joe. That's the lesson for today, guys. If you can get your opponent off balance, you use his own energy to defeat him. Get your ass in my office, private. But Sarge, he was just... Hey! Don't try to cover up for him, Jackson. I saw the whole thing. He started it. Sarge, you got it wrong. Knock it off. He's not worth it. The guy's trouble. Move it. (Motorcycle coming to a halt) Jackson: Still on the shit list, ah? Till they decide whether to court-martial me or not, here. Go ahead. Nah, Man. That ain't gonna happen. You know, Charley said six Ninjas went after you and Patricia. Those guys aren't amateurs, and neither am I. Now, com'on, level with me. Where'd you learn those moves? And don't give me that look either. I know you didn't pick'em up in the streets. I'm from the streets. I don't know where I learned 'em. I just know 'em. As far back as I can remember, I just know 'em. Come on, gimme a break, will ya? Look, your moves are too perfect. Somebody had to teach them to you. It's a long story. OK. I lost my memory a few years ago. My whole childhood is completely wiped out. I remember bits of things sometimes, but they're like dreams. I can't seem to figure 'em out. Look. I still think you can make some good use of those fancy moves of yours. You know, you and I, man, we could make a staged exhibition. You know, like wrestling, in the States? Man, the crowds here, they go crazy for that kind of stuff. I don't like crowds. Look, Joe... Read my lips. We can make some easy money. Look, Jackson. I don't wanna fight, I don't like crowds and I don't need money. Miss, we'd better get going. You'll get in a lot of trouble if we don't ah... Leave now. Yeah, you don't need money. He he he... Hey, what do you need? He he. Glad to see you're still human. She's cute, isn't she? Who? Who? You may have kicked my ass, but you did not make me blind. Jackson, she's the colonel's daughter. I know, but nobody's perfect. But she is cute, isn't she? Isn't she? Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He he he... You're tinglin'. You're tinglin'. I knew I've touched something again. He ha haaa. Yeah. Boy, you sure are lucky goin' back to California. I wish I was going back to california. You couldn't tell by lookin' at me, but I'm a famous surfer. I love nothin' more than wiping a few... Charley... Charley, stop the car. What's wrong? Stop the car! What is it? More hijackers? I gotta get you home in one piece. Listen, you gotta do me a big favor. Ah, no. I can't. I can smell trouble already. Charley, listen! there'll be no trouble as long. so just keep your mouth shut and you take me back home right now. Listen I'll explain it all later. He he he. Hehe I know... OK. Hoo... Whoa... Ha ha ha. OK. Hey, listen, you been thinkin' about those exhibitions yet? Because you know we can make a great team. We could quit the army. Then we make a fortune. And maybe Charley can help you out. Naa, no thanks. They've sweating's bad for ya. It means you're puttin' forth effort. Listen Jackson, you gotta help me, man... Yo, what it is? I set myself up with a date with this girl, but the colonel's got me runnin' errands. In 30 minutes, I'm suppose to meet her at the country club, and I won't make it. Could you run a note over there for me, and tell her I'll be late? I hate to burst your bubble man, but I can't. I have to report in a few minutes. I have NCO Duty. Ah, Shit. Man, I hate to lose this chick. Jackson, she thinks I'm intense. I'll get her the note. No, no, no. You can't, you're confined to the base, man. I'll be fast. No one will notice. Are you sure? Do you want her to get the note? She'll be on the balcony man, wearin' a white dress. You cannot miss her. Jackson. I'm gonna need your bike. Oh, man, that's my baby. That's my life's blood. Thats... You sure you can handle it? Look, Joe, call me a worrywart, call me, irresponsible... but how do you plan to get off the base without the MPs catching you? Watch. (Engine starting) Watch. (Shifting gear ) Watch what, Joe? Joe, Joe... Joe? (Tire screeching) Joe? What's he gonna do? Oh no. Is he gonna do what I think he's gonna do? Yeah (Engine purrs) (Engine rev'in up) Well... look here, Charley. I wanna talk to you about your future. My future? Yes. See, you're gonna put on working fatigues, and comeback in a flash and be ready to cover up for Joe. What's that got to do with my future? Because If you don't do what I tell you, you ain't gonna have a future. Ah... OK. Yeah. OK. (Engine rev'in) Hi, Joe. Is this note from Charley for you? Nope. It's for you. "Have a nice time, got ya!" This is your idea? I had to see you. Look... it can never work. Oh, be quiet. It's gonna be a wonderful evening. Come on. Come on. ♫ Romantic tune ♫ Why, thank you, Luis. Oh, don't worry about it, Joe. You can order anything. It'll go on Dad's account. That's him. That's the one from the convoy. I thought you said you'd taken care of him. I did. I had him confined to the barracks. I'll place him under arrest immediately... One moment. Let me look at him. What's the matter? The sergeant? Oh, don't worry about him. He's a real pussycat, really. Ah hehe, That's señor Ortega. He owns a big plantation on the other side of the island. Dad really likes him. Arresting this guy is not enough. I want him dead. Dead?! There's an investigation goin' on right now. Could blow the whole thing wide open. You sure? Yes. And already I know how you are going to do it. (Engine rev'in) Oh, come on. Come on! (Patricia laughs) Ha ha ha. Like my bike? Heh, Yeah. Yeah. I had a nice time today. So did I. Would you like to come in? I don't think I should. I think you should. (Birds chirping) (Door opens) Ten hut! Come on, Get up! We've got some soldiers in this unit, who think they can make a fool out of me. They don't know I've been a sergeant in this man's army before they were born. Even before they were sent to reform schools. I understand you like to do extra duties, do you? No, sir. NO?! I heard yesterday you volunteered to do some, didn't ya? Well, don't worry, Charley. I won't deny you that privilege. You could keep doin' 'em, till I said you had enough. And that's gonna be a long time from now. And as for you, hero... you believe my orders can be ignored, right? You don't like the hard work. You'd rather be drivin' around town, right? Well, I'll have you drivin', all right. Report to the motor pool! Sergeant Rinaldo told me to report here? There's an assignment for me. That one goes over to the courtside warehouse down at the dock. You know where it is? Thanks, I'll find it. (Footsteps) Hey! This warehouse five? Where is everyone?

Telephone! Get me the sergeant. (Phone ringing) Rinaldo here. Listen, he escaped the trap at the warehouse. I don't know how he did it. The ambush was perfect. listen to me, Sergeant. He was here. He's seen the missile. He knows too much and I want him dead. I don't care how you do it. The plan must proceed as programmed. Don't worry about it, Victor. He'll be taken care of. (Hanging up) Hold it right there, soldier. You're under arrest. I have to see the colonel. My truck was hijacked. My order is to place you under arrest. You'll get your chance to tell your story to the duty officer. Take him away. (Prison door opens) Sir. I'm sorry to bother you sir, but I believe a mistake has been made. What is it, Corporal? A man may have picked up for being AWOL, and I may be able to explain the circumstances sir. There's only been one arrest today Corporal, and that was no mistake. Unless you want to question a direct order from the colonel. Sorry, I don't. But could you tell me the charges, sir? Very serious, Corporal. It has to do with stealing military equipment. Expensive military equipment. Stealing military equipment? I warned you not to involve yourself with the man, Corporal. Hey, you're a good soldier. Why don't ya keep it that way? Stay out of this, eh? heh. But Sarge, this just doesn't sound right. But, couldn't his story be true? We've lost a lot of trucks in the past few months. Yeah, that's true. But he's always had witnesses before. This time he was alone. Now, losing a truck, in itself, is a heavy duty violation... which will result in serious charges. He might have sold the shipment to the rebels. in which case, he's gonna sit for many years. But Sarge, it was a mistake. You don't know the man, Jackson. He has a criminal record. It's true, a mistake was made here... and that was enabling him to enlist in the army. Forget about him, Corporal. His fate's in the court's hands now. Thank you, Sergeant. (Door closes) Patricia: Bye bye Patricia: Bye, thanks for coming. Nice seeing you. Bye-bye. Patricia. Hello Corporal. Dad's inside. Actually, I came to see you. It's about Joe. What about? Well, his in the brig, and your father wants to court-martial him. What? Yeah! Well, come inside. We'll talk about it. Colonel, something just isn't right. I know Joe sir, and I know... That's enough, Corporal. But dad why won't you listen... I don't want to hear any more Patricia, from either of ya. The man's been nothing but trouble ever since he got here. He's gonna be court-martialled... and I'm gonna make sure he gets what's coming to him. You're dismissed, Corporal. Yes, sir. The American knows too much. It is too dangerous to let him live. He must be terminated. My men failed to kill him in the jungle. They made the mistake of underestimating him. I will not. Can you do it? Can you kill him? I'm going to kill him. Then do it. Yes. Tonight. Will do. (Power short circuit) Yeah, it's probably a fuse. Where is that damn box? Hey, Tuck? Tucker? Get this damn thing to work here. Let's see now.

I think he's gone. What's goin' on? Hey, Collins, over here. What's up? What's all the commotion about? Right this way. Jackson. Joe, how did you get out of prison, man? Never mind. Look Jackson I need your help. The Ninjas were sent to kill me in my cell. And they gonna try again. All right, wait a minute. Start from the beginning, man, So I'll know what are you talking about. The sergeant's got some big operation going. OK, hold it. Right here? Pull up, yeah. Take out the lights. Here, light it over here. Oh, my God. This is crazy. You're gonna get yourself killed. Look, why don't we tell the colonel and tell him? He will listen to us now. There is not enough time. They are planning on leaving in the morning. I gotta catch Ortega before he leaves. What I need from you is a jeep, and then meet me behind the motor pool in a half-hour. You got it? Yeah. And Jackson... be careful, huh? OK. Here he comes. Jackson, what the hell is she doing here? He told me everything, Joe. You can't go through with it. You'll get killed. Gimme the jeep! Will you trust me on this one? Joe, please listen to me, please., why don't you talk to my father first? I know he'll listen to you. I know what I'm doing. You gotta trust somebody, sometime. If I mean anything to you, please trust me now?! I can't. We're the only two people you can trust now, man. Please, Joe? OK. Let's go. All right. And you honestly expect me to believe this cock-and-bull story, Private? It's the truth, sir. The sergeant's working with Ortega. And they may be behind the hijackings. Colonel, may I suggest that we go back to the base, run up some men, and go kick some ass... sir. I've known both of these men for years. The sergeant's my most trusted man. We went through the war together. You know that, Jackson. Well, dad, can't you just check out Joe's story anyways before it's too late... and, and the missiles get shipped out? 'Tell you what I'll do Patricia. In order to eliminate any doubt that you might have on this matter... I'll launch a full-scale investigation, starting right now. We'll find out if this man's story is true or not. Hello, this is the colonel. Would you send a squad of MPs along with investigating officer, out to my house, right now? What? When? Yeah, I hear you. Right away. (Hanging up) Well, the ball's in motion. Let's relax and have a cup of coffee while we're waiting. Janette? Oooh! I told you so. He he he. Ha ah. (Tires screeching) (Tires screeching) Alright let's go. (Footsteps) (Door closed) Sergeant, arrest this man. Draw up the papers necessary charging him with manslaughter. What are you doing? Get him outta here, and by George this time, make sure he doesn't escape. Let's go! No, please! Stop it, Patricia. Stop it. He killed an officer while escaping the stockade. This man has a criminal record. He served time in prison even before joining the army. He's no good for you, Patricia. Is it true, Joe? Take him. Sheesh! Go! Don't let him get out of sight! Get him! That son of a biaatch. Com'on let's get to the Jeep. (Tires screeching) Don't let him get away! That son of a bitch. Hey! Com'on move out! (Sirens goes off) Follow him! Follow him! Alright, stay right there. Stay right there. (Gun shot) (Gun shot) (Gun shot) (Gun shot) (Cars colliding) (Bang) Fuckin' bastard. That way. Shit! Get outta here. GET OUT OF HERE! Move your ass or I'll blow your fuckin' head off! (Ughh) (Tires screeching) (Bang) (Whack) (Cars clashing) NOOO! What's the problem, Bill? I was sound asleep. Fit to you head we convinced this operation was foolproof. It is, my friend. Let's talk inside, ah? (Door unlocked) This... Joe... has only been a minor inconvenience. The shipment will go out tomorrow as scheduled. No one can stop us now. It's gone too far. Too many people know. We've lost the sergeant and four men, and the bastard's got away again. He could be anywhere by now. Calm down, my friend. Calm down. Come, sit down. Ah? He is a nobody. Even if he finds someone to listen to his story, who will believe him? Where's his proof? No, it's too late to back out now. (Thump) Aghh.... We can't risk it. We're not shipping it out. What about the people you're trying to help? Have you forgotten about them? Like all the government has? Without this shipment, their country will fall to the communists. One more domino down. Who knows what country will be next? It stops now, Victor. Maybe later, when things calm down, but now we must stop! Let me tell you something, my friend. For me, this is not a private crusade for a noble cause. I stand to make four million dollars on this deal. Four! And no one is going to stop me from collecting it. No one! I give the orders here, Victor, not you! What are you going to do? Call out your troops? Create an international incident? It would be... very easy for me to reveal your part in this to your daughter. What would your precious daughter think of you then, ah? (Thump) We're not shipping it out! I'll be there in the morning to take everything back. Now you get out. This has been a very big mistake, my friend. (Door opens) (Door closed) Okay, (Slammed on the floor) (Whak) (Thump) (Pbeesh) (Thak) (Pbesh) (Thump) Aghhh.... (Thump) (Pbeesh) (Pbeesh) You have remembered well. It was you. Before the explosion, it was you. It is time to remember everything. Come. The haragei. I taught you that when you were six. Do you remember? When I was six? When I was six... you taught me many lessons of the haragei. How to free the mind... of thought... and let the senses grow. Yes, I remember. You were just a baby when I first found you. I called you Joe. That was the only American name I knew. I conditioned your body and your senses. I only teach you what you need to know... so that when the time comes, you can take your place on the field of honor... and meet your destiny. But then the explosion separated us. The explosion. There's so much I remember... but there's, also so much I don't remember. I let you forget what you saw before I found you... so that your mind would not be clouded with pain. But now, you are ready. The time has come for your final lesson. Kusari-gama. Shuriken. Sai. Ninjatō. These symbols, will focus the ultimate power of purpose. Jin. Ritsu. Sai. Zen. Koba-dera. The koba-dera. Ninja magic. Intong jutsu. The ability to seem invisible, to cause fear and paralysis in your enemies. You are ready, my son. I will be with you in deed and in my heart. Follow the Bushido. I will honor the code, Father. Beware the Black Star Ninja. He has taken the dark path and has betrayed the code. Then... he must die. Perfect. Right on time. Everything is working perfectly, ah? Yes. Do you have the missile? Ah, The missile is in a container with everything else. Everything is, ah... all ready to go. Good. Ah, These are the... documents, to get the shipment out of the country. Everything is... Everyone is taken care of. Ha ha ha. You can leave without delay. Thank you. May I see the money? Of course. Not until we see the merchandise. Of course. Ah, right this way. (Swoosh) Ninja: Hmmm?! Who is he? Is he one of us? The American ninja. American! What do you want? (Swoosh) (Knack) (Knack) Kill him! (Gun shots) (Solders shooting) Get the girl. I'll be right back. (Gun shots) American! It was a nice try! But it wasn't good enough! I have your girlfriend here! You have 30 seconds to surrender, or your girlfriend is dead! Joe, don't do it! (Slaps) 30 seconds! I know you can hear me. Or maybe you don't like her as much as she thinks you do, ah? (Sweesh, Swoosh) (Swoosh, Swoosh) (Swoosh) (Swoosh) STOP! Argh... Five... four... (Whap) (Claps) Very good. Let her go! Letting her go wasn't part of the deal. Kill him. Ninjas: Eiyahhh... Ninjas: Hop... Calm down, calm down. (Ninjas shoutings) It's all right. Just relax. Aiiyah... Yahh... Eiiyah... (Swords clashing) Ughh... Eyaghh... Víctor, this is too risky for me Ninja: Oghhhh..... Arghh.... It's all right, believe me. Aghh... (Sword clashes) Ugghh.... Aiiiiii.... Ahhhh.... (Thump) Aiiyah... Ughh.. Oghhhhh... Eiyah.. Ah, shhhaa. Arghhh... (Vanishes) (Thump) (Gun shots) Up ahead! (Soldiers shooting) (Armoured personnel carrier shooting) (Drum beat) Ahhhh.... Hang on, charleys! I'm taking this bitch uptown. Take me home, baby. Whooo... (Gun shots) (Thik) Eiiyahh... Black Star Ninja: Release! Black Star Ninja: Eiii... (Thump) (Thump) (Thump) (Thump) (Thump) (Thump) Black Star Ninja: Arghh... Black Star Ninja: Eiiish Black Star Ninja: Hmm... hack (Gun shot) (Gun shot) (Thump) (Thump) Holy shit. (Pbeesh) Argh... Argh... Eiahhhh (Cracking the nuts) Got you tight, huh? Huh? How do you like that in your nuts? (Thak) (Thak) (Slapt) (Thump) (Thak) Jackson: Arghhh... (Thak) (Gun shots) It's too risky Víctor. Cya in another day. I'm leaving. No, you can't leave. You stay here. Next time. You stay here! (Gun shot) (Gun shot) Bring the girl. (Gun shot) (Patricia screams) (Gun shot) (Pbeesh) (Thump) Arghh... (Thak) (Thak) (Pbeesh) (Gun shot) (Gun shot) Let her go, Victor! Now listen to me, Colonel. All I want is the money. Let me go to the helicopter, and your daughter will be free. Don't do it! You know I will kill her. Hold your fire! Hold you fire! Nobody shoot. (Patricia cries) All right, let her go, Victor! Let her go! (Gun shot) Arghh... Get in! (Patricia screams) (Patricia screams) Get in. Go! Go! Go! Go! Com'on. Go! (Sweesh, swoosh) Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait for the ninja. Aiiyahh... (Swords clash) (Swoosh) (Sword clash) Black Star Ninja: Eiishh... (Swords clashes) (Thik) (Swoosh) Black Star Ninja: I'll teach you! (Sweesh) (Thump) Black Star Ninja: Arghhhh.... Go, go, go, go. go! Black Star Ninja: Arghhhh.... (Gun shot) (Gun shot) Help! Joe! (Thump) (Thak) Yeah, come on, Joe. (Patricia screams) (Pbeesh) Patricia: Ohh... Ohh.. (Patricia screams) (Patricia screams) Get off it, man, get off it. (Patricia screams) (Patricia screams) All right. Now I gotcha.
