(peaceful music) (suspenseful music) (electronic beeping) (machine beeping) (explosion booms) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (screams) (groaning) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (groans) - The case. (suspenseful music) (whistling) (suspenseful music) (whistling) (sniffs) (suspenseful music) - What gave me away? - Perfume. I gave it to you for your birthday. - Oh, was that form you? (suspenseful music) (sticks clacking) - You've been practicing. - A little. (groaning) (sticks clacking) - I hope you're not forgetting who taught you in the first place? (sticks clacking) I like this. It kind of reminds me of old times. (groaning) (suspenseful music) - They want you back. - They? - Wheeler wants you back. - Well you can remind Wheeler that I'm still officially retired and definitely not interested. - I think it has something to do with my father. (suspenseful music) - How? - I can't tell you. - You can't tell me or you don't know? - I can't tell you, not yet. Crash, this may be our chance to find out what really happened. - I've closed the book on this Becky. - You haven't closed the book on this, you're afraid to even open it. Look, what happened between us might be over, but what happened that day five years ago is not. And if you don't wanna do this for me, then do it for yourself. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (men shouting) (suspenseful music) - [Tango X-ray] No response from Seal Team Alpha. Assume bogey's are in control. (guns firing) (men shouting) (explosion booms) - Tango X-ray, Tango X-ray, this is Alpha One, I need fire cover and a med evac, over. (guns firing) (groans) Tango X-ray, Tango X-ray, this is Alpha One. We're in a tight spot, I need fire cover over. (guns firing) (groans) Tango X-ray, Tango X-ray, this is Alpha One do you read me? - [Tango X-Ray] Roger that. Attack Group Two, hit 'em hard. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (plane whooshes) We have a locked on target, fire at will, fire at will. (suspenseful music) (bomb whooshes) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (groans) (explosion booms) (flames crackling) (suspenseful music) (gun clicking) (groaning) - Cheers mate. You can leave us alone now. Dingbang and I are gonna have a little chat. Alone. (door slams) (suspenseful music) Oh dear. Here's how this is gonna work. (suspenseful music) - Just wait. Sit down. (groaning) - Temper, temper. You attacked a Federal Agent. You could very easily have been killed during the struggle. Now we both know you're a mule working for Victor Soff. What's Victor's connection to $3 million worth of Lebanese money? - I ain't saying a word. - You know I had hoped we wouldn't have to play it this way. I guess this is just gonna have to be off the record. (television crackling) - No hold it, hold it, hold it. I've seen him do this before. - Here's the deal orange peel. I'm gonna ask you a question. If I think you're lying, or you don't answer. I pull the trigger. (suspenseful music) Just to prove what a fair guy I am, I'm gonna go first. - You're nuts man. (suspenseful music) (gun clicks) (sighs) - You know, no matter how many times you do that, you never quite get used to it, you know what I mean. Okay. Your turn. What's the deal with Victor? - I, I, don't know. (screams) (gun clicks) Come on, don't kill me. (gun clicks) (whimpers) - Listen, I've been looking for Victor Soff for the last five years. I can't ask your partner 'cause he got away, so I'm asking you. Where were you supposed to meet Victor? - Nico was gonna give Victor the money. I never met the guy, I don't know where he is. (gun clicks) (whimpers) We met two guys in a bar. One was arguing with a chick, they gave us the money for the shipment. - Where they Lebanese? - I don't know, I ran, I slipped to safety. (gun clicks) (whimpers) - What was the girls name? - Jana, Shana? - Shana, Thana, what was the girls name? Tell me Dingbang. - She was dressed like a whore, that's all I know, I swear please, please. - Get him out of here. (groaning) (gun clicking) - You know one of these days you're gonna put the wrong bullet in there. - Captain, I don't know what the deal is with this Lebanese money, but this is big. - Hey well, you're gonna have to put it on hold. You've been assigned to the CIA. 9:00 a.m. today. - What? CIA? Captain let me remind you that my work in America is specifically to break up international drug cartels. - Well then, let me remind you, that your boss put your services at my disposal as I saw fit. And I see fit to assign you to the CIA, 9:00 a.m. today. You got that? (suspenseful music) - Hey! That's my spot. - I don't see your name on it mate. - [Driver] Come on! (horn honking) - Relax. - [Driver] Move it! (horn honking) (humming) - Sir, please wait your turn. - Oh, okay. Okay, I'll just, I'll wait back here. It's cool. (change clinking) DEA, 9:00 a.m. appointment. - Thank you sir. Hey. - Wayne. - [Wayne] How you doing? - How you doing? - Alright. - Hang on, what about him huh? - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. Listen, I wonder if you'd do me a favor. My, uh, truck is parked outside. - Okay. - And there's a black Mustang in my spot. - I'll take care of it. - You see that guy over there. I want you to give him the Monty. - The Monty. - Uh huh, the full Monty. - Okay. Excuse me, there seems to be a problem. - What problem? (suspenseful music) - I assume you've made arrangements for getting it through customs? - It was an expensive proposition, those public servants are demanding Francois to pay one, then another, then another, to make them all fat. Give me a billion dollars, I'd own all of Washington. - I think it's already owned by so many people. - No matter. Soon the dollar will have no value and America will change it's name to Chaos. - The G3 device is made up of two components. A chemical explosive and the viral agent. The purpose of the chemical explosive is to spread the viral agent over several miles. - Jack, welcome. - Anyone exposed to the virus will die within five to seven days. Anyone who comes in contact with the person who's been infected will also die and so forth. There is an experimental vaccine for the virus, however its supply is extremely limited. The collateral damage of an event like this is virtually impossible to estimate. The virus can survive only at a temperature of minus 273 degrees. And this is the fact that may help us. The containment time for the deport system weighs well over 300 kilo's, that's almost 660 pounds. Which means that they will not be bringing the border in a knapsack. - Assistant Director of Operations, Robert Kelly, will head interdiction teams, any questions? Thank you. - [Robert] Okay, Agent Dobson, you're with me, we've got a lot of work to do. - Hey. - Good to see you Crash. - Hey Thompson. - That'll be all Robert. - Sir, if I'm charge of this operation, I feel I should be privy to all avenues of the investigation. - You are Robert. This is personal. Have a seat will you? Rebecca and I didn't think you'd come. - Well, let's chalk it up to curiosity. What do you want? - Any comments on what you just heard? - Yeah, I think you have 100 agents trained to handle this sort of thing. (suspenseful music) - We think that Lissette Martino was behind of all this. You are the only person who's ever seen her face to face. (suspenseful music) - She's dead. Killed in the airstrike after she shot your father. - No one except my father was ever positively identified. - You telling me she's been underground for five years pretending to be dead? - We also have this. (suspenseful music) - Francois Gordeaux. - Exactly, and you know as well as I do that Gordeaux never committed a terrorist act with Martino at his side. (suspenseful music) - Then get it, we are paying you enough. If it's not there when I need it, I'll be very unhappy. You do wanna make me happy, don't you Cherie? So I don't have to come and visit you and your lovely family. (speaking in foreign language) - Small enough to carry? - And the temperature we need. You know Francois, a thousand years from now people will still talk about this. Can you imagine? (suspenseful music) - We found the remains of what, possibly is the truck used in the raid. Rebecca traced to the point of purchase back to a dummy company with ties to Gordeaux. - Gordeaux's corporation also provides financial support for an avowed Muslim dissident. Eddie Numay, born right here in Seattle. - I was wondering what brought you guys to the West Coast. Eddie Numay. Taxi driver. I presume you're tailing him now? - He seems to be enlisting the help of the local drug dealers. An HM Customs and Excise Agent working here in Seattle with the DEA, recovered a large sum of Lebanese money last night during a raid. As a matter of fact, he was supposed to be here at nine o'clock this morning. Where the hell is Agent Byrnes? - [Receptionist] Byrnes is in security sir. - Whoa, excuse me. - Wayne, I think there's been a slight misunderstanding. Apparently Mr. Byrne's is working with us. - [Wayne] Oh, I see. - You. I might have known you'd have something to do with this. - Oh, we're sorry for the inconvenience. - Inconvenience? You had me stripped search because you lost a parking space, Mr. Happy here nearly gets me to expose my meat and two veg, and you're worried if I'm inconvenienced. - I didn't lose the space, you stole it. - You two know each other? - Uh, we met, briefly in the parking lot. - Who are you? The meter maid? - No, no exactly Mr. Byrnes. I'm the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, this is Agent Riley and this is Agent Jordan. Agent Riley is in charge of surveillance operations for which you will be supplying field expertise. - Surveillance of what? - That's on a need to know basis, Mr. Riley will debrief you as he sees fit. - Debrief. You're having a laugh aren't you? The way I look at it, I've been debriefed pretty much already. And you know what? I'd like to know what the hell is going on before I agree to anything with the CIA. - It's Nigel Sullivan isn't it? Your boss in London. - Yeah. - Yeah. We're close personal friends. I'm sure I can convince him to have you reassigned to checking baggage at Heathrow Airport. - Uh, ooh, look at the time. Are we ready? When do I start? - Excuse me sir. - Yeah. - We've got Eddie Dumay at the old barge at the docks. - Looks like you start now Mr. Byrne's. - So um, I don't know if you had a chance to notice. But um, I've been getting into weightlifting recently. I mean, just to tone up you understand. I mean, it's all there. The bulk, the size, the mass. Go on, feel. Big right (laughs). (car beeping) Hey, hey. Hang on. Where's my car? This is my spot. What's your car doing here? - Um, your car was towed for security inspection. - Security inspection? I was here first. - You were not here first, I was waiting for it right over there. - Exactly you were waiting, I got here before you. - Will you two stop it. Crash, just get in the car. - Crash. (laughs) What's all that about? - Well here in America, we call it a nickname. - [Byrnes] Oh no kidding. (suspenseful music) - They got here about an hour ago. No ID on Dumay's buddy. (suspenseful music) We've got activity. - Whoa, eat my shorts, it's Victor. It's Victor Soff. - Who's Victor Soff? - You guys want a drug smuggler, this guy's the biggest in the business. His operation is directly responsible for most of the heroin coming into this country. - Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing? - Listen, Victor's not gonna stay put for more than a few minutes. You want him, we need to move now. - We don't want Victor. We want the people he's meeting and the information they have, do you understand? - Look if we don't move now, we don't get any information whatsoever, do you understand? - I'm getting audio. (speaking in foreign language) - [Becky] It's pretty garbled. - Becky see if you can step up the frequency? - You just don't get it do you? This is his turf. He'll be prepared for contingencies. - Give me that. - If we want him we need to move now. - Give me that. (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (groans) (speaking in foreign language) - What the hell is he doing? Everyone wait here, alright. (engine revving) (suspenseful music) (groaning) - There is no deal. I have not been paid. Where is my money? - What do you mean? I gave your men the money. Three million, last night. - I have not heard from anyone. I don't know where they are, and I don't know if they're alive. - Hey, it's not my fault if your guys ran off with the money. - Is it my fault? Huh? Are you saying it's my fault? - No, no, there's no problem. There's no problem. Lissette will give you lots more money, yeah. - All I know is you gave me no money, huh. And if I don't see money. - But-- - I start shooting people. - Let me go. - And you're first Eddie. - We found Nico. - Victor, I swear, I was gonna call in man. I was gonna call. I had to get away. - Where is my money Nico? - [Eddie] Yeah, where's the money? - The DEA, they took the money. Please. - The DEA? - I didn't know what to do (sobbing). - Did he tell you that? And then you came here? You stupid idiot. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - Everyone move, apprehend targets. I want them alive. Becky coordinate from the roof, call for back up. - DEA drug bust in progress. South side, the old docks, requesting back up now. - Everybody let's go. (suspenseful music) - Put 'em down, now. (gun thuds) Do it! Down on the ground. (suspenseful music) - Byrnes duck. (gun fires) (groaning) (guns firing) What the hell are you doing? - Trying to catch the bad guys. - Stop. - What? - You're gonna listen to my orders or I'm gonna shoot you myself. - Alright, alright, I'm sorry. Okay, it's just I've been looking for Victor around the world for the last five years. It's the closest I've ever been. - Then let's do this right and maybe you'll finally have him, alright. - Yeah. - Okay. Shh. (suspenseful music) - Move it! (guns firing) You're welcome. - For what? - Just saving your life. - What about what I did for you upstairs? - Oh come on, I could see that guy coming a mile away. - You did not see him and he was gonna pop you sure as rain. (gun firing) I want these guys alive. (gun fires) (groans) (gun fires) I said alive. - No you didn't. - Yes I did. You can't take one simple order can you? - But they shot at us first. - When they follow, you close and you lock the door. Then you go back to the boat and you draw the police there. Okay, go. (suspenseful music) - This way. - [Crash] Damn! - Damn! (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Oh great! Now what? We're trapped. - Oh it's get better. Remember I was telling you Victor would have contingencies? - [Crash] Yeah. - Well there's one right here. - Oh please don't tell me that's a bomb? - It's alright simmer down, I did six months with the Bomb Squad in London. I'll take care of this. (guns firing) - So then, you're kind of a bomb expert? - Yeah. Yeah. (gun fires) (screams) - Three suspects escaping in speedboat. Headed west. All units converge. Repeat, all units converge. - I don't wanna rush you but there's-- - Shh. I'm concentrating. Red is dead. Green is clean. It's green. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Byrnes] What? - You're not gonna cut the green wire are you? - Yes, I'm gonna cut the green wire. Is there a problem with that? - Yeah there's a problem with that. I mean, I heard you never ever cut the green wire. - Oh dear, just sit back, relax and watch a professional at work. You never know, you might learn something. (suspenseful music) Voila. You know you need to trust me a little bit more. (screams) (screams) - I told you not to cut the green wire. (suspenseful music) - [Byrnes] Go. (gun fires) - [Crash] Come on, through here, come on let's go. Go, go! So how long we got Mr. Bomb Expert? - [Byrnes] Somewhere between very little and none! (suspenseful music) (explosion booms) (water splashing) - Are you okay? (groaning) - How'd we do? - Three got away, the other's are dead. - Three got away, the other's are dead. Wonderful, just the way I had it planned! Let's go. - Oh I see, it's my fault is it, of course. Just fantastic. Right yeah. Silly me. I love getting wet. (engine revving) Yeah just awesome Crash. Somebody give me. Hello? You forget something? Me? Hello? - The cats out of the bag. The terrorists know we're onto them and we have to pursue every possible lead. - This isn't a lead Cliff, it is a waste of time. Martino is dead. - That's unconfirmed. - Well, he reported that he saw her die and had he done his job right in the first place his partner might still be alive. (laughs) - That was your call, not mine. - Jack, Jack. Let him go. - Hey, I told you it was mistake to bring him back. He can't get the damn farmhouse out of his head and it's compromising his judgment. - This is not open for discussion Robert. Jack is the only person who's seen the suspect alive. He's on the case. More importantly gentleman. I received a phone call 30 minutes ago. An unnamed terrorist group will release the Gambia virus on July 16th at nine o'clock in the morning, in an unnamed American city. - That's in three days. - What are the demands? - There are no demands. - The President's here on the 16th. Seattle could be the target. - Well at least the President has had the vaccine. Nonetheless, that's an additional consideration. (panting) - Thanks for leaving me behind, partner. So, would anyone like to know where they're headed? - [Crash] Okay, whereabouts in Canada? - If your guys, whoever they are, are working with Victor. Chances are they'll be right here. Tahsis Bay. Victor has strong connections in the area. I worked undercover with him for over a year. What? - You dripped all over the map. - Sir, he's a loose cannon. He doesn't listen to orders. - Then you two should get along just fine shouldn't you. And remember if you locate the enemy do not engage, contact us. - Oh no no no, allow me. - [Becky] (laughs) Thank you. - I still think I should handle this on my own. - Mr. Byrnes knows the lay of the land. My sources tell me he is one of England's finest. - Really? Finest what? - Hey. Becky and I, we were just talking. We wanna pick up some snacks before our little road trip. What'd I say? - Listen Becky, you're not a field officer. You don't need to go on this. Whoa. What's that? - The vaccine to the virus we're looking for. - Well I don't want it. - Well too bad, because you're getting it. - Ow! You did that on purpose. - Whoa, we need to talk about this. - Oh come on, you're not afraid of little old needle are you? Pull your pants down. - Okay. - (laughs) I'm just kidding. Give me your arm. - Ooh. Ah. Ah, that was painless. Anyone since when do you need shots to get into Canada? - Since you joined the CIA. (suspenseful music) - Robert. - Hmm. - I want you to get in touch with Covert Ops. - Hmm-mm. - I want one good man who will not question an order. Any order. - I understand. - You know what, I'm just gonna get something from my car, okay. Oh um, Becky I'm gonna grab some CD's, do you like Barry White? - Yes, I love Barry White. - Great. - "I love Barry White." What's all that about? - Well, I'd call it being polite. - Oh no no, you see, I've been watching you two and I just don't like the way you're getting all chummy with this guy. - I think you're getting jealous. - I don't get jealous. - (laughs) Right, gotcha. - Um, I found some Beethoven for you. ♪ Pa pa pa pa ♪ (upbeat dance music) Alright so let's recap shall we? We're looking for Victor Soff. A Cambodian drug smuggler who just happens to be transporting some bad thing across the border to a bunch of terrorists. Two of which, may possibly be French-Moroccan. - And it's a delicate situation and if we find them we do not engage. Do you think you're gonna be able to handle that Byrnes? Restrain yourself from killing anyone. - That's precious. That's like the pot calling the kettle black isn't it? You aren't exactly the poster boy for restraint now are you Mr. Crash? - What exactly does that mean Mr. Byrnes? - Oh, I've heard all about you. - Oh you have, have you. From whom? - I'm sorry, that's classified. - You know what, I don't have time for games. If we find the terrorists we do not engage, understood? - Understood. - [Crash] Good. - Unless they shoot first. - What was that? - I said I'm dying of thirst. Any drinks in the back Rebecca? - No, I don't think so. - No, no beverages? (suspenseful music) - [Lissette] Hi Victor, good to see you. - I'm sorry about your friend, Eddie Numay. - He'll have his vengeance. Let's go inside and talk. (suspenseful music) - Robert I have a very hard choice to make. If you could save the lives of many people by sacrificing one innocent person, would you do it? - If it was absolutely necessary. - And if that person was your friend? (suspenseful music) (relaxed R&B music) - I can't believe you've been talking to Byrnes about me. - No one's been talking to anyone about you. He's just playing with you. You're being paranoid. - What's this? - Nothing. - It's my psych file. What are you doing with my psych file? - Wheeler gave it to me. I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. - An eye on me, what for? - You know what for. Your behavior was, to say the least, a little erratic before you quit. He just wants me to watch for signs. - Signs? This is unbelievable, you guys bring me back and now you're worried I'm gonna flip out. - Crash, you know as well as I do that you changed after my father was killed. It was like you had a death wish. Wheeler is just covering his bases. - Covering his bases. (paper tearing) - Very professional. - Whatever. How much further? - About an hour. - Let me know when we're close alright. - Goodnight sleepy. - I'm not sleeping, I'm resting. (relaxed R&B music) So what's the story on this guy we're meeting? - Part time fisherman, part time drug smuggler. A good source of information when I was in town. (gun clicks) If Victor's got your terrorists anywhere near this area, he'll know. - And how we are gonna find him? - Oh, he'll be at the bar. Nothing ever changes in a town like this. - Alright Becky, I want you to wait for us here. Contact Wheeler, give him our status alright? - Okay. I'll be close if you need back up. - Alright, let's go. - Hey. - What's with the hat and sunglasses? - Give me that. I'm sensitive to the sun. - Is there something you want to tell me? Huh? (suspenseful music) Hey Byrnes, hey. (upbeat dance music) (people chattering) Nice place. - Bingo. (laughing) (laughing) (laughing) Will you excuse us for a moment please? Bao my friend, how you been? - Oh what am I? What, what, what, what are you doing here huh? Come, come. Hey hey hey. You would never supposed to come back here. - Alright, now come on that was four years ago. People have forgotten by now. - You know, I'm gonna ask this again. Is there something you'd like to tell me? - No. (suspenseful music) - Byrnes, what the hells going on? - Some of the guys in this town, they might want to kill me. - What? - Yes, yes, yes. A lot of guy want to, to kill him. - I don't believe this, really? - Yes. - And you were planning on telling me this when? (suspenseful music) - I didn't think it was important. - You didn't think it was. What? Are those the guys? - No, no no no, those aren't the guys. - [Jing-Quo] Byrnes! - Those are the guys. - Byrnes! (suspenseful music) Byrnes! - [Patron] Move it, move it, get out of here. Forget your jacket, forget your jacket! (suspenseful music) - Where are you Byrnes? - Jeez, check the scar on that guys face? - Byrnes! - Why am I guessing you had something to do with that? - It was an accident. - I told you never to come back here ever again. - You make friends wherever you go, don't you. Now you're gonna have to pay for this. - I think you're in trouble. - Hey Jing-Quo, Jing-Quo, Jing-Quo. Jing-Quo. Jing-Quo. - In there, kill him! - Hold it. Nobody kills Byrnes but me. - Who the hell are you? - Who the hell are you? - This could get interesting. - Put it down. - You put it down. - Hang on, that guys not Cambodian. (suspenseful music) - Actually he's a terrorist, PLO. - Some of these guys are your guys. - Put it down. - No, you put it down. (suspenseful music) Alright, okay. (guns firing) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - No, you're guys two sandwiches short of picnic. - First of all he isn't my guy. Secondly I wouldn't say your guy was operating on all cylinders. (guns firing) There he goes. - Who? I didn't see. They knew we were coming. - Of course they knew we were coming. The whole damn town knew you were coming. - I'm not talking about my guys, I'm talking about your guys. (guns firing) You had a leak. - How come you didn't tell me this town was hostile? - How come you didn't tell me we had a leak? - Because I didn't know I had a leak. (guns firing) (groaning) - [Byrnes] Alright okay, so what the hell are we really looking for anyway eh? - [Crash] Don't worry, I'll let you know when we find it. (suspenseful music) - [Byrnes] In order to catch him, I suggest we drive extremely fast, okay? - [Crash] We're not trying to catch him. We're gonna follow him and see who he meets. - Who is this guy? - Faiid Asid. A Palestinian freedom fighter. - Palestinian, I thought these guys were French-Moroccan? - Lebanese and French-Moroccan. - Lebanese, French-Moroccan, Palestinian, what is this? The terrorist all star team? (suspenseful music) - Okay Byrnes, it's you and me. We're going in. Becky if we're not back in 30 minutes, I want you to head back into town and call Wheeler. Under no circumstances use that satellite phone, you got that? - No, I'm coming with you. Those are Wheeler's orders. - You are not coming, those are my orders. We need to confirm the location of that warhead, if something happens to us, I need you to call it in. - You don't think I can handle myself do you? - Becky, I think you can handle yourself just fine. But someone has to stay back. - Excuse me. - He can stay. - Becky, we are going, you are staying that's it. (suspenseful music) - Fine. (clears throat) - Thank you. - [Becky] You're welcome. - You ready? - Let's go. (suspenseful music) (truck door rattling) - Carefully. (speaking in foreign language) - Are you gonna tell me what that is? - It's a contingency. - Contingency for what? You said you were gonna tell me when we found it. - We haven't found it yet have we? - This isn't about terrorists. It certainly isn't about drugs. This is about something you guys don't want anyone else to know about. You know what, this is some CIA conspiracy to overthrow a government or steal a submarine isn't it? Eh, eh? - Would you keep cutting? - Would you mind telling me why I'm risking my life. - Alright fine. It's a disarming sequence for a biological warhead containing the most deadly virus known to man, happy? - Now was that so difficult huh? - That shot that Becky gave you? Experimental vaccine, if we get exposed we have a 50/50 chance. - 50/50. If I'd known that I would have asked for two. (suspenseful music) Hey. Hey. Don't you think I should have that disarming sequence as well? Just in case something happens to you? - Yeah, yeah. That makes sense okay. You gonna be able to remember this. Alt TM Shift. - TM Shift. - GWD, backslash backslash D TD. - DWP. - No, no, no. - Backslash. - What? - Backslash, backslash D. - Backslash, backslash PTD WD. - No, no, you know what I'm gonna write this down for you. - You don't need to write it down, just give me a quick look. Alright. Alt TM Shift, GWD. I've got it. - You got it? - Yeah. All the monkeys shift gears when driving back and backing down the driveway. - What? - It's pneumonic. - Pneumonic. - Yeah, pneumonic. It helps you remember. - I know what pneumonic means, I'd feel better if you had it written down on a piece of paper. - No, no no no no no. You can lose a piece of paper. You can't lose what's up here. (suspenseful music) - [Wheeler] This is Wheeler. Are things going as planned? - Yes they're inside now. (suspenseful music) (distant chatter) - [Francois] Nice and easy. Nice and easy, good. Alright, careful. Be careful. Excellent. - I guess we won't be disarming it very soon will we? - (speaks in foreign language) Out. Victor is nervous. He wants more money. - Victor is important to us. He provides manpower, weapons. He has connections inside law enforcement, we need him. Triple his fee if agrees to see us through our mission. - I'm also concerned about the men. They are becoming anxious. - It will be over soon. - We should simply shoot him ourselves. - No, it must be the CIA that kills him. We rely on Mr. Wheeler to do his job. (suspenseful music) - Who was that? - Lissette Martino. President's travel itinerary. - In Seattle? (suspenseful music) - Covert Ops. Wheeler's gonna assassinate the President. - I knew it. Another CIA conspiracy. - I've known Wheeler for 15 years, it doesn't make any sense. - Oh it makes sense, the CIA's planning another covert assassination of the President. (suspenseful music) - [Lissette] You were followed you fool. We need to leave at once, load everything. (speaking in foreign language) - [Francois] Everyone now, everyone come on. (speaking in foreign language) - [Francois] Alright put them in the truck, let's go. Hurry, hurry. - They've been tipped. - Well, we better stop 'em. (suspenseful music) - [Byrnes] So what now? - I got a plan. - Riley? Run him over. (gun fires) (brakes screech) (suspenseful music) - What's happened? Take cover. (guns firing) - Glad you could make it. - Okay, so we stopped it, now what? - That's as far as my plan went. - Oh marvelous. (guns firing) - Stop! - Why am I thinking this isn't good? - Maybe they ran out of bullets. - I think we need to take a look. - Let's take a look. (groans) (suspenseful music) (explosion booms) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) Where are we going? - [Crash] Up! (guns firing) - Another other brilliant plans? - Not hearing any strokes of genius from you. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) Great, I'm out of bullets. - Yep, me too. (suspenseful music) - Well, I guess it's time to go huh? - Go, where? - There. - There? Are you mad? That's more than a hundred feet. - Well you don't have to go if you don't want. - Fine. (suspenseful music) - We go on four. - Four? What happened to three? - Everybody goes on three, can't we be a little different? - Yeah I like it, yeah. Four, a good round number, solid, even, let's do it. (suspenseful music) - [Crash And Byrnes] Four! (suspenseful music) (screaming) (water splashing) - [Captain] We've been over the whole area sir. Totally deserted, no sign of Crash or Byrnes. - Alright Captain, keep looking. - We have to consider the possibility that Riley got out alive and he knows about the Covert Ops. - Oh I'm aware of that Robert. I'm gonna handle it personally. (water splashing) (spluttering) - [Byrnes] I jumped higher than you did. - Did not. - Yes I did, and I swam faster. - You're dreaming. - Oh I'm dreaming. Of a new partner. - Come on let's go. - Where? - [Crash] I don't know, let's just get out of here. - A new change of clothing would be nice. (suspenseful music) Well this is nice isn't it? A couple of mates taking a leisurely stroll by the riverbank. (laughs) Maybe we should stop and do some fishing eh? - [Crash] Does it hurt? - [Byrnes] Does what hurt? - Being a mental defective, I mean do you fall down a lot when you breath and think at the same time? - Look, you can blame me all you want for what happened back there, but I'm not the one that tipped off the bloody terrorists now am I? - What the hell does that mean? - Exactly what I bloody well say, we were set up mate. And your darling little Becky, she's the only one that could have managed it. - I'm gonna knock your head off, you obviously don't know the relationship I have with Becky. I trust her with my life. - As long as you don't trust her with mine. - I've had it with you mate. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. - I'll tear your head off and spit down your throat pal. - Fine, let's go. - Oh you want some do you? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Now? - Now. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Hung zoo. Ho tow, hee hoo. Ha. Oh. Ah. Right then, let that be a lesson to you. Next time. (suspenseful music) (helicopter rotors thrumming) - By now Wheeler knows we're alive and he knows we've seen his operation. - Meaning what? - Meaning he's probably got people looking for us and I'm inclined to think they're not gonna wanna bring us back alive. - You people are mad, do you realize that? I mean killing your agents, shooting the President. Take a pill for God's sake. The CIA's off its collective rocker. - It's not the CIA dummy, it's Wheeler. He's using the agency to fulfill his own agenda. By now he's got everyone convinced that we're the bad guys. - Great, so we're the villains and they're the boy scouts. You do realize we're not gonna get out of this alive. - Speak for yourself. I'm gonna make it across the border, back to Seattle and warn the President. - Now, would that be before or after you stop the international terrorists hell bent on destruction single handedly? - I'll figure that out along the way. So you're either in or you're out. - Well considering the circumstances, I'm in. - Good. (helicopter rotors thrumming) (suspenseful music) - That wouldn't be uh-- - Boy scouts. - Suggestions? - Yeah. - Well? - Run. (helicopter rotors thrumming) - [Pilot] We have a visual. Two men matching description. (suspenseful music) (panting) They're in the trees sir, heading east. - [Commander] Try and locate them. - [Pilot] Roger that. (suspenseful music) - [Crash] As soon as we hit this road, we'll double back and they'll never see us. - You're right, they'll never see us. Why do I stay with you? Oh fat load of good that's gonna do. We haven't got a live round between us. - They don't know that. It's called a bluff, I suggest you join in. (suspenseful music) - Oh yeah. Look I'm scared, real scared. - Hold your fire, I'll handle this. - As soon as I say break. You go left, I'll go right. - So what you're saying is I get killed over here and you get killed over there, marvelous. - You're under arrest for conspiring to kill the President of the United States. (suspenseful music) Go ahead and make a move. You'll be dead before these guys get a shot off. - I don't want you dead. Listen to me, I know how this looks, but you're gonna have to trust me. In all the years that you and I have known each other, have I ever lied to you? I'm willing to bet my life that you'll see what I'm doing is right. - Go ahead and shoot him. - If I was what you think I am, do you think I'd be standing here with you two? I'd be in the car watching you shoot it out with the posse. Trust me, just once more. (suspenseful music) Stop, hold your fire. - Lower your weapon Byrnes. - Have you lost your marbles? - Just do it. You haven't got bullets in the gun anyway. - You're all quite demented you Americans, you know that? Your guns and your vitamins and your fiendish desire to jog about in sweaty clothes. - There's someone you need to meet. (suspenseful music) (door closing) - I am sure that you are both anxious to know what exactly is going on. - That's an understatement. - Things will go a whole lot quicker if you just listen Mr. Byrnes. My name is Shannon. I work an organization called Sphinx. Sphinx is compromised of an elite group of law enforcement agents from around the world. We take on cases that are considered beyond the scope of the more traditional police agencies. Our resources are virtually limitless and our jurisdiction is worldwide. We do not answer to any single government. I am here to offer you both a position in our organization. - (laughs) He's kidding right? Sphinx. - No Crash, I can assure you Mr. Shannon is dead serious. - Alright, we'll play along for now. (suspenseful music) - There is no for now Mr. Riley. You are either in, or you're not. (whispering) - [Crash And Byrnes] We're in. - Good. Gentleman the terrorists terms are quite simple. Tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. as the President steps from his limousine at the International Plaza here in Seattle, the CIA must assassinate him. If they do not, Lissette Martino will detonate the G-Three virus in a major American city and millions of people will die. (suspenseful music) - Alright this one's okay, lock it up, let's go. Come on, we've got a long night ahead of us. Keep it moving, come on, come on, let's go. (suspenseful music) - Um, we had a security breach. - [Wheeler] How? - The terrorists knew that we were coming to Tahsis Bay. Someone tipped them that we were at the cannery. - Agent Jordan informed us that you suspected a security breach Mr. Riley. Nonetheless she was under my direct orders to call in and she did. - How many people had access to the information from Becky's call? - We began mobilizing immediately. Almost everyone on the floor knew what had occurred. - Obviously the chain of command has been compromised. - I'll take care of it. - Mr. Byrnes, you will accompany Agent Jordan. Mr. Riley, I'll need to see you in the Situation Room. - One question. Why us? - Be flattered Mr. Riley. Sphinx only recruits the best. We've been watching the both of you for quite some time now. You'll soon discover that there are very few things at Sphinx that are coincidence. - You thought I sold you out. - All I said Becky was that I thought there might be a security breach. - Look me in the eye and tell me it didn't cross your mind. - Well, what about you? I mean it's not like you've been entirely truthful with me. I mean this whole Sphinx thing and everything, you never told me about that. - I said I-- - You know this is absolutely scintillating stuff, really interesting. But, uh, can we talk about this later maybe? - I think that's a good idea. Let's go, excuse me, (suspenseful music) - The optimum height for the delivery of the virus is 400 feet. Now at that height the concussive blast will spread the virus across an area of approximately 16 square miles. If the bomb is detonated at ground level, then the effective spread is a quarter mile radius. Mr. Riley, if you were Martino? - I'd go for the biggest bang possible. - Well, I don't know what to tell you. - It's just sometimes he just makes me so angry. - Well, maybe you still fancy him? - That was the past. - They sent this disk, along with a sample of the virus. (suspenseful music) - The DNA signature is unmistakable. - We have surveillance on all air traffic systems in every major city. Complete radar coverage. - Unfortunately all of that may have just become an exercise in futility. Until now we have been searching for a relatively large containment tank. Something that would require a substantial mode of transportation. All of that may have just changed gentleman. 20 minutes ago I received an intelligence report informing me that the terrorists may have developed a portable refrigeration unit. Capable of keeping the virus stable for a short period of time. The terrorists can now walk the bomb past us into any skyscraper in any city in America. If we thought we were looking for a needle in a haystack before, we're now looking for a snowflake in a snowstorm. (suspenseful music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Yes. - We have the goods. Make them believe that Portland is the primary target. - Affirmative, out. (suspenseful music) - Forensics found this in the wreckage of the barge. Hey can you can this in please? Thanks. (suspenseful music) Okay, just pick up the resolution on that. Good. - Oh that's Faiid. - And his girlfriend. And there's a chance she might even be here in Seattle. - We tell Wheeler first. - Oh no, we tell Crash that's it. You think I trust the CIA? - You're part of Sphinx now. - Oh yeah, that's right, Sphinx. Okay, but we tell Crash first. - I want to make Portland our primary search. Coordinate search parties with all the local fire, water, power, any other agency you can think of. - Psst. (suspenseful music) Faiid's got a girlfriend. I have a hunch she's here in Seattle. - Just a hunch? - Yeah, it could be a feeling. - What is it? A hunch or a feeling? - What's going on Jack? - Um, Byrnes has a lead. - Actually it's more of a feeling. - We do not have time for feelings, get him out of here. - No, I say we see what he's got. - No it's okay Bob, we've gotta check out every possible lead alright. Why don't you show us what you've got Mr. Byrnes. - You don't have a name, you don't have an address and it's not like Faiid's gonna tell you anything. - Well, Dingbang couldn't remember the exact name of the girlfriend. Said something about Shana or Fana. We could always ask him? - What is this? A joke rally? You're going to Portland. I need everyone on those search teams and that's an order. - Kelly you know as well as I do, we don't have a hope in hell of finding this thing in time. If Byrnes wants to go on a wild goose chase, I'm going with him. - You know what, I think we should follow his lead. Thompson you go to Portland. - Yes sir. - The rest of us will set up headquarters right here in Seattle, alright? - I want you to use repeaters. It's a dedicated frequency and if you have any more feelings you can contact us directly. (suspenseful music) - I'm going with him. - That's fine. - Not mad at me anymore? - I'm still mad at you. - Crash, one last thing. You know Lissette Martino, you know how she thinks. If we carry through with her demands, what's to stop her from using the bomb anyway. - Nothing. (suspenseful music) - Screw you, I ain't saying anything. - You sure? Okay. - Well, this was a good idea. - Listen, when I wink, just nod, smile like you mean it. - [Crash] Like I mean what? Ding, that guy over by the door. The tall guy, CIA. You know what they call him, the Angel of Death. (speaking in foreign language) He does very bad things, very, very bad. Helps people remember. And he uses sharp instruments. We kind of overlook it, you know. National security and all that. I've seen him operate, you don't want him to get his little backpack out, ooh no. No, he really, really enjoys his work. - You know what? - Oh wait, wait, wait. It's Rubba Dub Dub. It's Rubba Dub Dub. - What? - She said something about being late for her work at Rubba Dub Dub club, that's all I know. - It's a massage parlor, let's go. - How? (suspenseful music) (growls) (upbeat dance music) (door knocking) - Doors open. Hey. I don't normally do threesomes but for you guys I'll make an exception. - [Crash And Byrnes] It's alright. - Sit down. - Come on, sit down. - When'd you graduate charm school? - Do you know a man by the name of Faiid? - Maybe. - Alright that's it, let's take her in Fred. - Okay no, yeah I know him, why? - When's the last time you heard from him? - You know, I do a special massage for cops. Lose the girlfriend and I'd be happy to accommodate you boys. - Have you heard from Faiid or not? - Look, I don't want any trouble. I haven't seen him in a couple of days. He's not my boyfriend or anything, I don't even like him, you know. He's always criticizing the way I dress. - Listen to me very carefully. If you're not involved in Faiid's business you have nothing to worry about. - Well he only calls me on my cell. He gave me the phone. I don't hardly ever use it though, I heard they give you brain tumors. - Yeah I heard that too. (clears throat) - Anyway, he called me this morning. He wants me to drive to Reno after work and he's gonna meet me there tomorrow. - Where's the phone? - It's right behind you in my bag. - How many calls have you had since his? - None, I told you I barely use it. - I got the number, it's a local area code. - Try it. (phone beeping) - You're British aren't you? - Yeah. (clearing throat) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - No answer. - Alright call the local phone company see if you can get the address on that number alright. Okay let's go, come on. Come on. - I make house calls. (suspenseful music) - [Tom] Sir. - Yes Tom. - What is Byrnes is onto something? What about the President? - The President refused to cancel his trip Tom. He will not give into terrorist threats and I strongly suggest that we do everything to stop it becoming a reality. - But there's very little security there sir. We should at least redeploy. - Tom, Air Command is on full alert in every major city. All we can really do now is pick a principal target and protect it. And Portland is the principal target. - It's done. - [Wheeler] Thank you. (suspenseful music) - Prepare everything for us, so we can leave immediately when we return. I want no trace of anything that we were here, understood? (suspenseful music) - They were just calling her from the road. - I got a hunch. - Not a feeling? - Sorry just a hunch, come on. (suspenseful music) - Nothing. - Alright let's head back. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (groans) (guns firing) (groans) (suspenseful music) - I've got a feeling. - I think I have the same feeling. - [Crash And Byrnes] Four! (guns firing) (groaning) - Byrnes check him. Becky look for anything to tell us where that bomb is. Got something. Imperial Towers, Downtown Seattle, come on, come on. (suspenseful music) - Alright, yeah I got it. I'm on it. - What is it? - Um, it's nothing, nothing. - Alright gentleman, we've got to go. - [Agent] Let's go men. (suspenseful music) (siren blaring) (fanfare music) - Look at this damn place. You expect me to cover this whole area? - I expect you to do the best job you can. - We'll coordinate all security communications from this point forward. (suspenseful music) Target will arrive in front of the International Plaza at 8:30 a.m.. Select a suitable position. Stand by for further information. - Copy that. (suspenseful music) - Good day sir, we are here to fix the air conditioning. - Yeah go ahead. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) - [Byrnes] Is this as fast as you can go? - [Crash] Do you wanna drive? - [Byrnes] Yeah. (suspenseful music) (siren blaring) (brakes screech) (suspenseful music) (siren blaring) - Kelly. (suspenseful music) Kelly! Something's wrong, get to Wheeler. Byrne's and I are going in. - Has anyone come into this building in the last hour? - Nobody, just the air conditioning people. - Where's the elevator? - Over there. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - [Kelly] Lissette, you got visitors. - Kelly says Riley and the others are on their way here. (elevator dings) (suspenseful music) (siren blaring) (suspenseful music) - Stop right there ma'am. - I need to speak to Clifford Wheeler, right now. (suspenseful music) - Drop the gun. Drop it now. - I must commend you on your persistence Riley. How long has it been? Five years? My sources told me you were retired. - I thought you were dead. - (laughs) How's Rebecca? Kelly told me you two are no longer, how do you say, an item. Ah, the mystery is solved. That fateful day in the farmhouse. Yes Crash, may I call you Crash? Kelly works for me. You and your partner were becoming a problem. The plan was to have both of you killed in that farmhouse. Oh well, not every plan is perfect. You must give me credit, this is my best plan ever. Your close friend Wheeler will kill the President and the CIA will be blamed. And we deploy the virus killing millions of people and again the CIA will be blamed. - You won't get off the building alive Lissette. - (laughs) Such courage. You're just like your partner, brave until the end. Goodbye Crash. - Hey, remember me. (gun fires) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - I've got Victor, I'm on Victor! I'm going down. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (groaning) (moaning) (suspenseful music) Hey Victor. How you doing? What are you doing running around with terrorists eh? Little bit out of your league isn't it? Couldn't you just stick to drugs? (suspenseful music) - Give me the code. - You want it? Come and get it. (groaning) - This kind of reminds me of those old westerns. Remember those? Fastest gun in the west and all that. Oh well, guess I'm just gonna have to take you in. - You must be joking. (laughs) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (screams) Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do it the other way? You choose. (suspenseful music) (laughing) (groans) (gun fires) (groaning) Bad choice Victor. (suspenseful music) - Victor? - Didn't make it. Lissette? - She didn't make it either. She reset the bomb before I had a chance to stop her. - Where's the disarming code? - With Lissette. - Oh great. - Well you remember don't you? - You ever thought about how you're gonna die? - I knew it, I knew you'd forget. - It's alright, just give me a second. Uh. Hang on, I think I remember. All the monkeys shift gears when driving back up the driveway. That's it, that's it. - Okay, okay. - All the monkeys. Alt TM. - Alt TM. - Shift gears. Shift G. - Got it. - When, W. - Uh huh. - Driving back. - And backing down. - No, no, no there's no backing down. - [Crash] You said and backing down, I remember. - There was no backing, I don't remember, do you? - It's your pneumonic device. - Hang on. I've got it. All the monkeys shift gears when driving back and backing down the driveway. That's it, that's it. - Okay, you're sure right? - Yes I'm sure. Whoa, whoa hang on. Driving back. - 10 seconds. - Shift, backing down the driveway. - Six, five, four. - Driving back and backing up the driveway. - Three, two. - Yeah, yeah that's it. (panting) - The President, let's go. (suspenseful music) - I need to speak to Clifford Wheeler right now. - Officer Jordan, how are you? - What is going on here? - You can leave us now. (suspenseful music) - Eight minutes. - I certainly understand the need to go through the proper channels but-- - Just calm down. (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa hold it. - You have to call it off right now. We located the bomb. - Kelly disengage, repeat disengage. Kelly confirm. Confirm. Kelly confirm. Repeat confirm. Con. (suspenseful music) - Target is the President, commence fire as the target steps out of the limo. (suspenseful music) - Get the secret service. - It's dead. - We need men in those stairwells now. Now, let's go! The snipers on the top level. Code is "Wheeler Alpha stand down." (suspenseful music) (panting) (groaning) (gun fires) - We're ready. - [Guard] Go, move now. Snipers on the roof. - Clear the area! - Hang on, that's the President. - What? - Does he look the President to you? - Yeah it looks like the President. - We have a car waiting sir. - I trust my substitute is unharmed? - [Shannon] He's fine Mr. President. (suspenseful music) - It's Kelly come on. (brakes screeching) - Do we have a plan? - Yep. - Are you gonna let me in on it? - Get the bad guy. - Just as long as we're both on the same page. (brakes screech) (suspenseful music) - Hey Byrnes. - Yep. - You remember you asked me a couple of days ago about how I got my nickname? - Oh yeah. - Well you're about to get a big clue. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (metal crashing) (brakes screech) (suspenseful music) - Hey, hey Crash. Where you going? It's gonna blow. It's gonna blow, go. Go! (explosion booms) (groaning) (flames crackling) You're welcome. - For what? - From just saving you from that rather large explosion. - What? You didn't save me from that explosion, I knew it was gonna explode. (siren blaring) - Oh look who it is. What are you talking about you knew it was gonna explode? You had no clue. - Yes I did. - No you didn't. Stop talking pithel. - Pithel? What the hell is pithel? - Oh just stop giving it the large will you. - Where do you come up with this stuff? - Are you alright? - Yeah I'm fine. - Yeah I'm fine too. - Give me the keys. - No no no, I'm driving this time. - I'm driving. - Uh, what you just did. I think it's my turn. - Just this once. - I still don't think that was the President - Will you stop it with the President. (engine revving) (smooth jazz music)
