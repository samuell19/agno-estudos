You will listen to my voice. My voice will guide you. You are no longer on your planet. You are in space. You will tell us everything. Must I really tell you everything? Yes, everything you know. The Earth was sick, rotten, so we had to look elsewhere. And, we found After Blue. In another system. A sort of paradise, With fruits, animals, defenseless creatures. We colonized, set new rules. What rules? Rules to avoid the same errors. No machines, no electronics, no screens, no wavelengths, no chemistry. Living in micro-communities, based on nationality like old times, with horses from Earth. The minimum, to hunt. And the laws? Cut the bad weeds. When evil appears, we cut its roots. Tell us about the males. Yes, the men. The all died early on. Their hairs grew inside because of the atmosphere. Only ovarian-bearers survive on After Blue. What about reproduction? Women are inseminated. That is how I was born: with good Earth sperm. How did it all begin? Tell us. Describe yourself. I find my head too big. And so, I die my hair yellow to make it less visible. What is your name? My name is Roxy, but the village girls call me Toxic. My name is Roxy, but the village girls call me Toxic. What are you looking at? It's a fucking head. Go on, Luce, pick it up. It's ultra rotten. Pick it up, I said. No, I'm going to shoot it. I'll pick it up myself. - Your strength is in your ass. - It's stuck. It's an entire woman. An entire buried woman. Get me out of here, idiot. I'm no idiot, liver-face. We're gonna wash you. I'm gonna fuck you up, octo-whore. Octo-whore! We can't leave her like that. She's there for a reason. Toxic. First, let's swim. We'll see after. You. Help me. If you unearth me, I'll grant your hidden desires. What does that mean? Three desires. Toxic! Unearth me. Unearth me, You won't regret it. Little sister. Unearth me. Bitches. You'll see what you'll see. Our turn, little sister. My name is Kate. Kate Bush. First wish. Your first wish was to rid yourself of your friends. I just wanted them to leave me alone. That's all. And after? After? After... Chaos overtook our village. The militia tracked Kate Bush along the winding coast. But, no one could find her. Over and over, I was asked to describe what happened, to describe Kate Bush. Her face, the hairy arm, the tattoo. You told them everything? Everything. Except for the eye in between her legs. It was no one's business but my own. No one else. No one. Were you persecuted? They hated me for having survived. The village women decided to let their neck hairs grow as long as Kate Bush was alive. Just to piss off my mother. She was the hairdresser. Did you feel alone? More than ever. Did the solitude weigh on you? I imagined things. What things? Baths of flesh and hair, baths of carnal pleasure. Sweet. Hot. Sticky. Care for a little... Purple Soup? You're not looking well, Zora. I still have some acidity, Severine. How's your daughter, Zora dear? Her arm is sore. It's the hairs. They grow in when you touch them. Little shit. Let her die of her hairs! She's a piece of shit. How can you say that in my home? Your little yellow shit unearthed death. Who will bring back my Chiara? Valeria! A little dignity please! We know where the killing head hides. She's a Pole. A fucking Pole. Her name is Katajena Bushovsky. - The bitch. - She cut her name: Kate Bush. A bad seed of the worst species. A criminal, gone mad from mountain powder. The Polish militia buried her in sand so the tide could do its work. But your daughter thought herself above the law. Kate Bush had committed several heinous crimes. She is convinced that she is the vengeful arm of After Blue. We found her lair. Empty, of course. An abandoned mine in Mount Axia. She lived like a beast in her rotten mine. She's a beast, full of hate, putrid. Poles are not afraid of the cold. They piss in their boots to keep warm. - The militia went south after her. - Absurd. Kate Bushovsky will return to her beloved mine. - What can I do about it? - It's simple. Take your lovely daughter and a warm coat so you don't die. You'll wait for Kate Bush to come dance the polka. But the mountain is ultra-toxic. Wear your filtering mask then. What is the problem? You'll make her wait for the militia. If you have no choice. Kill her in your own way. That's impossible. I don't know how. I'm not a killer. Look at my hands. Look! They are magnificent, but you cannot refuse. It's of concern for the community: Eliminate the bad seeds before they take over. It's the rule, my dear. But my salon... - Please! - My clients? Stop your whining! If you stay here you'll go bankrupt. And your daughter could split her head open on a rock. Who knows? But it could last a while. Come now. You can even claim the bounty. But don't run away. What will we do up there? Wash and set? YOU WILL KILL KATE BUSH Your mother accepted the punishment without resistance? My mother didn't have the choice. But I... You what? I had nothing better to do. I dreamed of leaving. To go far, far away. The Lady's mare is ready. All has been prepared for a nice trip. Zora! Come out of your den! Go on, go get her! Zora! Come out! Come on, hairdresser! No need for makeup. We will... We will what? What do you think? My mother swallowed her words when she was hurt. NOTHING REDONE You felt no community attachment? Maybe I never liked the village. - What are you talking about? - Nothing. I was thinking out loud. Well, think in silence. It's not the moment. It's simple. We have to follow her. The path is in her blood. You did not know After Blue. Its geography? My mother and I never went further than the winding coast. Settlers were discouraged from travel. Why? On After Blue, nomadism is seen as a form of decline. We should go now, Roxy. You'll wash your mouth. This meeting troubled you, though they seem repulsive. I felt Kate Bush in my mouth. I could see the evil entering me. Come on, move. Move! I'm hungry. I'm sick of stones. The Lady's mare is ready. All has been prepared for a nice trip. Bitch. What? The bitches. What will we eat? Sand? - Community of bitches. - What did you say? Take that out of there. It could take root. I'm going to... kill some beasts. I'll come with you if you want. You, set up camp, make a fire. Something comfortable and warm. I won't be gone long. Nature is generous here. Like... Like what? Like what? Like a can full of mould. Were you afraid? No, I wasn't afraid. I was plagued by anxiety. You should be. See what you've done to us with your bullshit? Not wanting to kiss you was no reason to kill us. I was not the one who killed you. Same difference. Poor clone. As long as Kate Bush lives, we'll be here. Erring and rotting. Nonsense! You're the rotten fruit of my imagination. Want to see just how far your imagination can go? The dead spoke to you? Touched you? Yes. Sort of. How did you react? I thought I was going crazy, then I accepted all I saw and heard. Roxy! Zora? Night fell. Without warning. Yes, they're black. And so what? They stink. They just smell like nature. Go on, eat. Eat! Swallow! Swallow! Did you have to say you unearthed Kate Bush? Why tell them? You always told me to tell the truth. No? And you always spoke the truth? Always. You know too well. Except for when I'm scared. The mare. What about the mare? Her name is Queen of Peru. Who told you that? It's written on her saddle. The dirty girl told me. She thought it was funny. And so, it's funny? What does Kate Bush look like? Tall, with one hairy arm. You can tell me the truth. What is she really like? Did you not leave something out? She was covered in sand. - I told you everything else. - Full of sand... She must have washed since. I have to know! To see her coming. To protect you. Protect me from what? The bullets. Kate Bush kills daughters, not mothers. She won't miss you next time. That's for sure. I don't understand why Kate Bush troubled you so. Who has never met Kate Bush cannot understand. Shit hole of a mountain. What is that? What was that? An almost dead horse, and screaming caterpillars. Nothing to... An almost dead horse, and screaming caterpillars. That is what she said. Word for word. And after? After, we arrived in the rain. On a Tuesday. She's crying. No, the journey is leaking. We have arrived. It's unimpressive. Take the mare. What for? If I die, take off at a gallop. But if I'm wounded, hide. - How will I be able to tell? - How? If I'm stiff, I'm dead. If I'm still moving, even a little, I'm wounded. And be very attentive, or you'll have my death on your conscience. And that's no small matter. Roxy! You think she has ever walked? Clean all of this. It's awful here. - Why me? - Because I'm alive. Was she sure of being alive? Sometimes she doubted, and would touch her heart with her fingertips. To feel it beat. My mother felt alone. I now know she was, far lonelier than I. Are you alright? Don't sneak up on me. I could have killed you with one shot. Behind the mirror, there's a grotto, orange and flaccid. Yes. So what? We're in a mine. It's normal, nothing to... Get rid of that and to bed. We can't stay here. We'll do what we were told! And if Kate Bush returns? I'll give you the rifle. You're a big girl now. I know you dream of killing Kate Bush. Am I wrong? Leave me alone now. I have to listen for the slightest noise. Here lived. Zora Rovich. Cutter of hairs. Makeup artist. I'll shoot with my Gucci. It can put a hole through rock, through wood, through bones. And through night? I don't want to die. Not right now. You are? A woman. As inoffensive as the wind. I'm waiting for Kate Bush. Katajena Bushovsky. You know her? I live across the way. I came to share the evening, and the rest of my bottle. Across the way, there's nothing. Yes, there's me. Just across the way. Over there. I see. That's reassuring to know. You find me reassuring? Here, drink this. It kills canker sores and useless words. Come on. Are you looking at my hat? It's the extension of my thoughts. Mystic? No, expressionist. Sternberg. Painter. The second avant-garde. You must have heard of it on Earth. No? You're not from here, are you? I can tell right away. It wasn't easy, was it, on Earth? The end of the screens, the economic-existential crises the neo-virtualists. And I had a broken heart. My model. So I came here. She did not like your work? He. He's blind, but has a superb body. You paint naked men? No, self portraits with floral hats. But I am sterile. You want to try my Chanel? Your loss. Nothing beats a Chanel. Light, fluid, precise. Not like your old Gucci. When Kate Bush arrives, you'll have to shoot. She won't hesitate. Something tells me that you want to kiss me. It's not a good time. I think. I'm still thirsty. Not you? More of your strange fantasies. No. I opened myself to my troubled feelings. Without chasing them away. Why not chase them away? Because I'm a pacifist. Don't bother, she's exhausted. She pleasured you and poof! Toxic, you'll kill everything with your bristly hairs. It's your karma. Leave me alone! Not in the morning! What's wrong? - You're going to complain now? - Let go of me! You can play with yourself whenever you want. You're alive. You can't escape your dead. Toxic, alive. It's no use running. We're going to ruin your life. Can't you tell we love you? You're alive. Roxy, stop! Can you hear me? Roxy, stop it! Stop it. Stop! I'm going to cut your hairs. We'll tidy the mine. Wash the walls. We'll get organised. It'll be... And there's nature here. Air. So, let's go hunting. I'm dying of hunger. Hunt what? Can't you smell that odour? - The Indiams? - No, death. Maybe Kate Bush is dead somewhere. We're wrong to worry. What is that? A dog. Here? Catch it! Catch it! I got him! Is that you, Kiefer? Who goes there? A dwarf? A dwarf! You must be the hairdresser's son? The daughter. Here. You have to be faster, kid, if you don't want to end up shot. She's not dangerous. She just likes to shoot. Tell your mother that Sternberg invites you for dinner. And bring something to drink. For four. Describe her to me. She doesn't look like her mother. It was my first man. And believe me. Even though I had seen photos, I was flooded. You caught it? You caught it? What? The dog, good lord! The dog that I killed. He ran away. Even dead, they keep running. If you think I'm going to eat stinky flowers. We're invited for dinner. Sternberg? I saw a man. Impossible. - I saw a man! - Stop it, you tire me. Wrap them in paper. You'll have to wrap the flowers in paper. You never believe me. Of course I believe you. When Kate Bush saw all I had, she became green with envy. Chandeliers, mirrors, food, alcohol, jewellery, music, dog. So I told her, I have my secrets. And they're well kept. There are luxiols left if you're hungry. Is there community spirit here? There is no spirit here. Only vanity. Only Climax and Kiefer, who cast torsos. Zora. They are ultra-neoclassical artists. They sculpt bodies and faces. Unbelievably banal. Monumental males, you see? I'm freezing. It's grandiose, well proportioned. Cosmic urine! But now they prefer still lives. Surrounded by hair. Dead men? No, they tan the hides to keep warm. Don't move. I'll warm you. Can't you smell it, Zora? The smell of carrion. Kiefer and Climax shoot all that lives, all that moves. Hair is... lucrative. You understand that, hairdresser. I prefer the heating flesh of Olgar-2. And you, little one? You're drunk, Sternberg. Come. I have something for you. So what you paint, then, is it realistic? Very. I followed him. I was cold. My mother stayed and did not look at me. Olgar-2 is blind. That way he cannot see our bodies age. How can he survive here? Who said it's a man? It's a woman? It's a Louis Vuitton. A new generation android. He's the exact replica of my ex-lover. If you care to know. I got him with the dog. But it's forbidden. Sometimes artists have privileges. What is that? Artists sometimes have privileges. Sternberg was above all wealthy. And well born. Here. Aim for the head so she does not suffer. Kiefer and Climax lay their traps everywhere. And after, there's no one. What? You've never taken a Youvence bath? No. That's what she told her. Mother told me the rest. Come. Kate Bush is perhaps dead now. No. She's thick skinned. The messiah of After Blue. Drink. You'll see things differently. One night, Kate came over. She wanted us to tattoo a blue stain on her heart. Kiefer executed. Kate cried during the tattoo like a little bitch. And when it was over, Kate said: 'Now that my heart is blue, I'll be able to kill.' What a joke. Kiefer saw her bawling, do you understand? And that was not possible for Kate. Kate held up Kiefer, like this, for a long while. 20 minutes, maybe 40. An eternity. And then, she hit her like an animal. Bubbles of blood came out of her eyes. But, what is Kate Bush like? Resentful. Demented. She could cut her own horse's throat while listening to disco. What? It is only an image. She never really did. But, she certainly could. And you were still with the android? We were speaking of art and creation. Painting exists only if eyes can embrace it. Here it is. It's my favourite. Touch. You'll see. You can keep it if you want. It's a fragile canvas. What are you doing with that? Put the painting down, little slut. Let go of the canvas. Or I'll put a hole in you. One last time: Let go of the canvas or I'll put a hole in you. And the blind android? You seem detached from him. I was stunned. But his tentacles filled me with desire. More than Kate Bush? You'll see. What are you doing here, little sister? Wake up. Kiefer and Climax saw Kate Bush roaming in the forest. Take your Gucci. No. This is when my mother met Kiefer and Climax. You could have killed her, Toxic. And deliver us. You're more deflated than a 100 year old's tit. That's it. Turn your eyes away from your cowardice. I saw her here. Beyond the sleeping forest. Wait here. Shoot what she merits. Shoot before the forest awakens. See you tomorrow, hairdresser. Want a bottle? You're not coming? We are artists. And me? And me! I'm a hairdresser. Kate Bush will hear you. Let her come! Kate Bush! Come show your cry-baby tits! It's not the good method. Lacks style. It's vulgar. She's still drunk. If you have the method, you do it. I'll give you all I have. I don't know how to kill. 50. And the bounty is yours. - It's all I have. - We're artists, not killers. 70. 80. 90. 95. She'll give you 60 if you bring back Kate Bush's body. Sternberg was an unexpected presence for my mother. She supported her, despite appearances. She puts herself in holes since childhood. I understand her. Calm down. Kate Bush is inside. We were inside, there's nothing. Under the bed. She can't go alone. Why did you not use your Paul Smith? Ah. Your mother surely wants a kiss before bed. I trusted you. I'm disappointed. You want to kill me? No. So why menace me? We're bound for life. I turn out the light, you guide in the dark. Roxy! There's nothing in the mine. Humans are more use dead than alive. Understand? You have 2 wishes left. I want you to leave us alone. Look deep inside. There's surely a horror to fill you with happiness. Don't get mired in the blooming Indiams. Coming? It's time for bed, my little one. Unless you want to do something else? Kate Bush disappeared, just like that? In a flash? An Indiams had taken Kate Bush's place. It seemed to have something to tell me. As if it wanted to say: "Wait..." "Wait." And so you waited? We waited in the mine. Avoid slashing my breasts, they cost me a fortune. They'll skin your Kate. Then you can make a hairy coat. Where is your offspring? On the roof. Looking at the sky. I climbed. We killed time. I killed time. Did you have repressed desires for Sternberg? No. I don't think so. I don't know anymore. What will we become? Did you think about that? I think about it all the time, if you really want to know. Here is Kate. Nice drape. It was her or us. Recognize her, buttercup? It's Kate Bush. She ran towards us, screaming. A bullet in the heart. Why not a bullet in her heart, Climax? It was a beast. Sentences don't stop beasts, Sternberg. And this? What is this? Kate was very dirty. Yeah. You unburied a corpse, shot it in the head. We killed Kate Bush. She had a blue stain and a hairy arm. We killed Kate Bush. Of course it's Kate Bush. Bravo. You've done a magnificent job. A drink, to celebrate? You're short 10. That's all I have. We agreed on 60. It's all I have. You're 10 short. Why is Kate naked? We thought it best to wash her clothes. You could have washed her hand. Cheers! Finally, some empathy for death. More than that. If you only knew. Your mother was truly relieved? She was absorbed by relief, like one enters a grotto. That evening they threw a party. The relief party. Sternberg's like her father. After Blue Transit, that's him. She has all she wants here. The bitch. That's how she got me. Sternberg pisses in satin. And she spits on love. Blind androids lie without breathing. My relationship with my father is poor. As am I. My mother was already cutting hairs. Could you shave me before leaving? I'd like to see what it feels like. If you like, I can try. But I'm leaving early tomorrow. There was even music. Liquid music. Who sang that? Kate Bush. Make us dance, Olgar-2. We're chilled to the bone. Light up your skin, Olgar. What are you waiting for? Go dance. He needs my authorization. He's programmed so he can't cheat on me. Wash your thoughts, Sternberg. They reek. You're nothing. Tell me, hairdresser... I'll be right back. We leave early tomorrow. My mother remained evasive about her evening. She was drunk. Memories are not reliable. But feelings never lie. You know? What are you doing alone, Roxy? What are you doing alone, Roxy? I'm smoking with my dead friends. Will you come back to see me? Yes. And you'll reprogram me? - So I can see you? - Yes. But when you return, you might find me used, old-fashioned? No. Never. I'll wait for you then. You'll come for me on horseback. And you'll kill Veronika Sternberg. A diamond bullet in the heart. Promise me. Yes. You will kill Veronika Sternberg. A diamond bullet in the heart. Zora! You will kill Veronika Sternberg. A diamond bullet in the heart. You left like that, without regret? Yes. As if nothing or no one had existed. In a breath. Without looking back. Without tears or remorse. That's a nice bundle. Yes, Madam. I killed Kate Bush. You are Zora. Yes. You're the talk of the town. And you little one, you know Kate Bush? Could I have something of Kate's as a souvenir? A belt, a boot? I'm a bit of a fetishist. Could you cut my hairs? I'm afraid I'll choke over time. You recognized her right away? Yes, immediately. I know a story so funny that it wiped out a whole community. Really? Tell us. I don't want to die laughing. You'd slit my throat for it. - I didn't know the Indiams could be... - Mounted? It's my guide. I'd do anything for the Indiams. Defend them from the human plague. Roxy. I harness it like that to protect it from itself. It doesn't hurt it, you know? It even told me it likes it. It tells me things in its own way. I know how to listen. Roxy. Deliver us. Don't forget us. You didn't react? I was unable to. Do you think I would have been fast enough to kill Kate Bush? She was not that fast, you know? Not so fast. Now. That you have killed Kate Bush, there will be militias, who will want to kill the woman who killed Kate Bush. Put your weapon down. I don't like that thing. I did not kill Kate Bush. It's broken. - The Paul Smith is broken. - Repeat! I did not kill Kate Bush. I did not kill Kate Bush. I'm only a shit hairdresser. I'm only a shit hairdresser. Our conscience makes cowards of us all, Zora. One wish left. The deepest in your heart. What wish? I can't say. You did not want to say the truth. Not all of it. That's all. Zora! I don't want to hear it anymore. It's not Kate Bush. In the bundle. It's not Kate Bush. You know it! You shaved Kate Bush an hour ago. You had her under your blade, Zora. - You could have ended it there. - Shut up! Kate Bush is there, in that bag. And she is dead. I killed Kate Bush. In my own way, I killed her. Get that through your big, fat, bleached skull. And never mention the woman I shaved again. Never again. Move! Move! Coward! Coward! What would you have done if you were me? No better, Toxic. We wouldn't have done better. Truth always ends up crackling dirty illusions. If you say so. ALL IS TO BE DONE, NOTHING REDON Go further over there. Don't look back. Smoke while you wait for me. You've seen enough horrors as it is. I won't be long. Here, Severine. We've killed Kate Bush. You don't look very well, Zora. All the acidity in my gut is gone. The air of the mountain, the powder of the mine. Roxy. Of course, what did you think? You have the third eye. Otherwise how could you see us? We killed Kate Bush? We killed Kate Bush? We killed Kate Bush! And now, what do we do? We look to the future. There is a place in our dirty paradise, a place for all the dead in need of love. That is what I told my mother. I believed it then. And I believe it now. Subtitles by Kendra Walker Subtitling CINELI DIGITAL
