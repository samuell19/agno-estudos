I've thought about it so many times. If the storm had not come that day, my life would have turned out completely different. When I say it out loud to myself, it sounds ridiculously naive. A summer storm has changed my life. When we first met, we hardly spoke to each other. I just told him I went swimming there, he said he drove vegetables to the town every Friday. And that night I fell asleep to his scent. It has mesmerised me so much I had to seek it. Ifell in love. And then he did not come. Never again. APRICOT ISLAND 50, what do you say, ma'am? Do you like it? This one's like made for you. We'll replace this... Wait. The engine is A-OK. Look... What do you say? Good, eh? So? Deal? - May I? - Of course... That's the one! Right? May I drive it away right now? Like I said, everything is A-OK, the colour even suits yourdress'n all... 50, I will need your ID... Then we can talk about the VAT... I think everything will be A-OK. All you need is have it washed... Something else you like? Ha! This one? Ma'am, wait, wait! Zavod imeni Likhachova is the brand! Two kids are easier to feed than this one! - Hallo! - Hallo... Excuse me, do you know where the owner of this truck lives? Yes... He lived over there, on the farm round the corner... - I see, thank you. - But, he's dead. - He died... Why did you leave me here? Oh, God... Hallo! Is anyone here? Jancihcomequickl Hallo. Is this yours? Is this our truck? Sorry, I don't understand... In Slovak? Jancsi, come quick' Hurry up! I've got her! I'm coming! What's up? Is the house on fire, or what? This is our truck. How did it get here? - Our truck, see? - How did it get here? It's here! I walked out and it was here. Hi. - Rézsa Jancsi. - Jolana Bazovska'. Babika... Here, we call Jolana”Babika"... - Yes, I know. - That's Lajcsi, my brother. Rézsa... This is our truck... It broke down... This is our truck... Excuse me, can I have a glass of water, please? Of course. It's our truck, I knew it! I need to get home somehow. It was nice to meet you... It's pretty here... This way? How does she want to go? On foot. There will be a field of sunﬂowers on your right, and you have to take the second turn after the... ehm, in front of the village. Yes! Please, speak quickly, my battery is running out! Yes! In the direction of Komérno! Hello! Hello... Shit! Shit! I've been sitting there for three hours... No, no, no, you don't have to take off your shoes here! It haven't even rained... Come in. If it had rained, you'd have even got soaked. I told Lajcsi you couldn't go, because there was no bus for you... - Would you like some coffee, Babika? - Yes, please. I hope you don't mind me calling your Babika... I thought I'd never see that truck again. Father had sold it and we didn't even know. Lajcsi said there's nothing wrong with it, it just run out of fuel. He would've left you on the road just like that. - Ups, sorry... - That's OK. Father, me, Lajcsika, catfish. It had almost drowned Lajcsika, it was so big. Back then, there were plenty of them. People crossed the Danube on their backs for the ball in Nyergyesfijfallu. We don't go in here... We'll clean it up a bit, let fresh air in... Mom and dad used to sleep here. Mom. Julifika. Pretty name, isn't it? Dad used to call her "szivem“... ...”my heart". Ifound herin the distillery. She'd suffocated. We'll bring in a bed. - I did not want to be a trouble. - What trouble? I could've gone to make a call... Someone would've come to pick me up. I will leave tomorrow morning. - What are your doing? - Let me be. Stop! Jolana Bazovska'... That's her. Put it back! Nice little ass, right? Little ass? Have you ever had a ted-head? A red-head? Redhead. Why do you keep repeating what I say? Red-head... Little ass“ You think“. “that she's shaved down there? They say city chicks shave down there. I don't know. I don't know... But when I imagine her driving that truck around the city... That's weird... What? Weird? Weird, weird... Weird... She's lying! Lying? So what? Finally. What finally'. Can't you wait, or what?! Someone's being impatient! Imagine a hairy watermelon! For Berti... For the Sunday football. He wants to cook a stew. W!“ he pay for it? He won't! And we've promised it to Gabi. He'll pay when he sells it. And when he doesn't sell it? Then what? She's hairy down there'.! What? Later... - Good morning. - Good morning. Jesus, what big fish! I've never seen a fish this big in my life. Beautiful morning. Do you like fish? Me? I love fish. With horseradish. Let's cook some, Lajcsi? We won't eat it in a week, foo“! But with horseradish... With what? Horseradish... Wait! Watch out, don't move! Babika! Watch out! Wait, I'll help you! Lajcsi! Come on, it'll break her hand! Move away, you'.! Come, come, come! Au! Water, quick! Water, quick! A catfish can break a hand even a day after it's caught. Once, uncle Andréfi had put a catfish in a sack on a horse... The catfish ﬂung its tail... ...and the horse fell. It broke the horse's neck! - Hurts? - A little... I was such an asshole in the morning... - Good day, uncle Andre's"! - Greetings, uncle Andre's"! How are you, uncle Andre's"? When will you come and see us on the farm? I'll come, my sons, I will. We'll whistle a tun e! That's my only joy. Wow, it's beautiful! Isee you have your truck back And the one that brought it back, she's gone? She's cooking. Cooking?! Oh, really? And what did she say? Where did she come from? She was buying apricots from Dad. Mhm, he had never mentioned her. or had he? I don't know any more... Here. You'll drop it. Give it to me. Me get meat, it not go bad. Shit, what's the ti me? We've slept through. What time does it leave? She'll go tomorrow. Tomorrow? What day is tomorrow? Sunday, no? There's no bus on Sunday, only on Monday... All right then... I just have to make a phone call. She can go and watch the game. Cheers! Cheers! Boo! He kicked him! Referee! Boo! Why didn't you stay at home, you Slovak cunt? - Who are you talking to? - You, cunt! It suits you. I didn't know if I could. Is it OK? Do you think he's noticed? Who does he take after? - Lajcsi? - Hmm... - He's always like that... - Like what? Taurus. Just like our father. Did he hit you? Father? No, never. Not once. Mom used to whip us. She kept a willow stick on the cupboard. We couldn't even touch it. I even know from which willow tree it was. They are all around... Father loved her, didn't he? They must have loved each other very much. Oh, they did! Once, when Mom broke her leg, that was in winter and we didn't have a car, he carried her in his arms all the way to the village through the snow. In the summer, they used to sit here on the porch. He read books to her. Every evening. Right here. Except on Fridays. On Fridays, he'd go to the market. Lajcsi still has those books. How did he die? His heart broke. To three pieces. With such a might it had ripped his chest. Because of Mom. And you? Me? What about me? Who loves you? - Who's the best? - Bodza! - Who's the best? - Bodza! - Who's the best? - Bodza! That was so cool... Nobody's ever fought because of me... I still have some! Pardon! Pardon... Is this our house? Ups, sorry, sorry... What? Let's go to sleep. We won't get up in the morning... What did he say? We're going fishing in the morning. OK, let's go. You stay... - She could cook something. - What did he say? You could make some breakfast for us before we come back. I didn't come here to cook. Hmm, and what for, damn it? What for? What do you mean, what for? To cook? I'll tell you whyl came here. Because that... I have to tell you. And that I won't tell you! Lunch! Lunch! Mom and Dad. Full! I ate at least a hundred! Yuck! I don't even want to see apricots for a year. I still have some days off... I can stay. To help, if you want. Hey! Watch out! Wait! Love me. Love me. Aren't you cold in here? Babika! Babika! Bring a knife and that large cutting board. When I woke up, Ismelled smoke from acacia wood! Hail to thee, Joseph II, forgiving us this tree, even though you didn't give a damn about us! LajcsLcome! We have to tum it around! Well... go! Are you coming? Go. quick'.! My hands are a“ dirty'.! Babika, come, help us! It's too heavy! I'll drop it! - Heave! It's all on my side! - My pants will drop down! Babika, Babika come here. Don't laugh! Wipe it out, damn it! With what? Your hands. Yuck! Mmm... This is the scent of Eden! Make some room! And Babika? Uncle Andre's"... Do what we do. Shit! And now say which one is the one from last year! This is a miracle, my children! A miracle! Babika, bring the pheasant. My children... I swear to you, I will miss this on the other side. If nothing else, I will certainly miss this! Around. - Cheers. - Cheers. Sorry, uncle Andre's"... Sorry, uncle Andre's"... Around. Around. Lady Fuck taught us... Lady Fuck taught us... She was some teacher! We stood there by the metal railing in front of the pigsty, eyes like poppy heads, and she kept poking the piggy: "Jump!Jump up, you lazy swine on the swine! Jump!" Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Well?

Go inside! My love, lam writing to you because I am afraid to tell you. The older I get, the less courage I seem to have. You know I was never afraid of anything. New am shay am“ am scared. lam scared to face you and tell you the truth. Maybe because I feel guilty for what has happened. I do not know, whether I fear for you, or myself, or whether I am afraid of what will come. I do not know. Ifell in love. I am truly sorry.
