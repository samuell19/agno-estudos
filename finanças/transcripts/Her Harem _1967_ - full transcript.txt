THE HAREM Come on, wake up. Wake up, darling What's wrong with these animals? Gianni, I need to talk to you - What's the matter? - I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind I don't want to marry you anymore - Then I'll marry you - I'm serious - I don't want to marry you - Fine. Now come here - Let's make love - Yes. But I don't want to get married Everything has been booked - church, honeymoon, reception at the Hilton Are you saying I should marry you because the Hilton has been booked? What you do with your life is your decision... ...but I want to know why you waited until now... ...7:14 am on our wedding day... ...to tell me you don't want to get married Cuffs, please. Why shouldn't we get married? Because I'm scared I'd like to, because I really don't want to upset you But my fear is stronger Sorry, but I can't do it This is madness! I can already picture the headline... ..."High-profile businessman dumped by fianc?e on his wedding day" Are you afraid you won't be able to be faithful to me? No, on the contrary I'd be too faithful I'd only think about you. I'd worry about you I'd take care of you, to the point of losing my identity... ...and becoming nothing other than your possession Eventually we'd grow tired of each other - And who could blame us? - We've already covered this subject You'll carry on working We'll decide together when to have kids Until then we'll carry on as we're doing now, using the pill No... Why don't we carry on as we are now? No ceremony, honeymoon or reception at the Hilton Just imagine - today we could spend the whole day together Come on, we have so much free time No, listen Marry me Then if in four months or a year you don't feel happy... ...we will separate. If you want, I can put it in writing Come on, let's get married Margherita I'm sorry, darling. But I can't OK. Let's end this, then Are you absolutely positive? In that case, it's not you who is dumping me It's me who is breaking up with you You'll realise that it's going to be much worse for you than for me Hello, is the professor there? Wake him up, it's urgent It's Invernizza speaking. Hello? I can't go into detail right now... ...but I have changed my mind I'm not getting married. I don't want to get trapped in No, I haven't told her yet Anyway, the official excuse is that I'm ill I don't know! You think of something! Appendicitis, peritonitis... Send an ambulance to my house in an hour Just make sure you send an ambulance It has to be very loud so that everybody can hear that they're taking me away OK. See you at the clinic. Bye And remember, my dear... ...that a woman can only find fulfilment in marriage, family and kids Have you been drinking? Come in So, no wedding? No... But I do love him It's just that I'm confused And scared I don't care I'm almost happy. I don't like that Gianni Would you like some tomato juice? I'm sorry, but you should have made up your mind sooner... ...not on your wedding day. Salt or pepper? Why do you eat these nice, colourful puddings every morning? Because they're low in calories Plus, I love colours I don't want to be anybody's property Three kilometres in the snow, idiot - The lady has managed to get here - She must be better than me, then - Hello, dear! How are you? - Hi, Gaetano You don't like this house, right? Yes, it's a bit weird. Lucky your mother didn't come... ...or God knows what she'd have told me! No, it's not that I don't like it. On the contrary, I find it very original You know I'm not here to see the house Any news from your fianc?? How are you doing? Why do you care so much about him? It's you I care about, not him. You shouldn't feel guilty You've done the right thing. Women have to defend their freedom And modern men must understand that women, in spite of appearance... ...are still the most fragile and defenceless beings We have to help them to break out of their chains... ...to be independent, to follow their instinct and true aspirations I'm sorry. I'm pedantic, but the subject fascinates me Carry on. It's not easy to find a man who speaks like you Mind you, I don't speak like this to other women Let's go and eat something. We'll warm up As you wish - What time did you get here? - At 7:00 Poor you It's snowing, you know? Darling, it's snowing My hair is driving me mad! - Which one is Gianni? - The bald one - And the other one? - That's Mike A bit bonkers, but quite a nice guy One day he left for Kenya. God knows where he is now In other words, your little emotional graveyard Can we consider them dead? No... They're both alive How soft! I'd love to have my little place too You never know Come here, Gaetano Let's have a romantic dinner Here. Let's turn the chair towards the window Come and sit down I'm in love, Margherita Madly in love You realised that, didn't you? Yes, I did - And you? - Me? I don't know It's too early to think about that again You're nice... ...kind... ...you've helped me through rough times I'm nice, I'm kind and I'm very comforting Is that all, Margherita? No, I also like you... very much No violence You said you would help me break centuries-old chains and barriers You're contradicting yourself, my dear lawyer You're right, I'm sorry I don't know what happened to me But I kept telling myself, "Calm down... ..."you don't have any right to violate her personality, she needs sweetness" Now you're exaggerating Don't be silly, Gaetano. You're great I want to go away I love it when you pull this childlike face Look I am childish You are childish We're all childish Who's throwing darts? Mike! How crazy! I'm so happy to see you again! You're such a fool. You could have killed me! It's a present for you The cheetah's name is Jack - But he doesn't know - Take him away or I won't come out How crazy to bring a wild animal here! It's just a baby cub... ...and I've taken out all his teeth Are you absolutely sure he's harmless? Come on, open up, Margherita OK, I'll open the door Mike, how wonderful! - What happened to your eye? - I've lost it How silly! - Let's have a look! - No, what are you doing? - Why are you undressing me? - I want to see your whole body No, let me cover up, I'm cold. What do you want? Here. Stand still - But why? - I want to take a picture of you Are you a photographer now? 200 different Margheritas The Lady from Shanghai - And now... let's go to bed! - No! Three days of travelling, five planes... ...and a taxi to get here No! Not with that beast in here. No! Unless you attack him, he's harmless I'm scared anyway Be good, Jack I'm sleepy. I want to have a really good sleep No, you can't stay here - Why not? - I'll take you to a hotel A hotel? What nonsense. Hotels drive me mad - I want to stay here - No Either you go to a hotel or to Ren?'s house And take your cat with you, because I don't want him You don't want me anymore? I understand now. You married Gianni, that fat guy I'm not prejudiced. You didn't get married? So, we can still make love Yes, but not now. Get up I'm staying here, Margherita - Jack, we're staying here - No. You are going! - What are you doing? - Do you like them? They suit you Beautiful Don't be silly - Go and get the car - Yes, boss! Nice guy, this Mike. He goes hunting in Kenya... ...dances, plays the drums and knows a lot of back girls - Ugo Tognazzi! - Yes Pleased to meet you Thanks He's the sexiest Italian actor I don't find him that sexy You see? The blackmail has already started - What blackmail? - The emotional blackmail You had a long face all night. And all because of Mike Where's your understanding? Your generosity? Now you accuse me of being jealous. I know I don't have rights on you, but... May I? - Margherita! - It suits you - It suits her more than you - Let's go. The car's here Sir, the car's waiting at the door - Thanks, Mike - You're welcome Listen, why don't we take Mike home first? I'd love to be alone with you No, Gaetano. I'm tired I'd like to go to bed. Plus, Mike lives with Ren? Let's go - Why does he have to live there? - How nice! So... ...let's see if I can help you make things clear once and for all You always say you're cold, but then you don't put enough clothes on You're such a darling How can this be possible? A woman like you - intelligent, independent... ...with great clearness of mind ... ...doesn't know what she wants when it comes to feelings I don't know. Do you? At least I don't annoy you all the time with my problems Are you really annoyed that I keep asking you for advice? No, but at least I'd like you to put it into practice - What are you doing? - Nothing No! Why are you cutting them up? To make an identikit... ...of your ideal man Come here Look carefully I've divided it up equally from the faces of three men... your men Forehead, eyes and nose - sensuality Mouth, chin and neck - determination. Do you agree? OK Now, let's try it with these segments of Gianni, Mike and Gaetano Your ideal man. Like this, this, and this What do you think? Don't you like it? I suggest we take out this big nose You haven't understood anything I don't want an ideal man. I want them Then why don't you carry on as you've done so far? A bit of hypocrisy, a bit of discretion A lot of women do that But why should I be hypocritical with them? I respect them. I don't want to deceive them But now I can't give any of them up Not Gianni, not Gaetano nor Mike So, what you want is... a harem That's it. Wait a second Ren?... I'd hoped you would understand me A harem You think sex can solve everything Right - Bye - Have you decided where to go? - To Yugoslavia, for two weeks - Have a nice holiday - And enjoy yourself - I'll try to Have I done the right thing by leaving? Jack, stop it! Do you think that I can solve my problems by running away? You're not running away. Don't exaggerate Think of it as a little holiday It's easier to think straight in a new environment. Plus, you'll have some rest - Do you ever work? - In theory I work in public relations But if I'm busy with your private relations... So you're my eunuch What I don't understand is why you want to go all the way to Yugoslavia I've heard that Dubrovnik is beautiful And at this time of year it's warm and sunny - We'll swim a lot - Yeah, in January? How nice! Come on, get out! Let's go It looks like taking a holiday wasn't the right therapy after all Maybe you're not the right doctor for me And who would you need? You don't want to tell me, do you? You'd need all three of them waiting on you Why don't you invite them over? I'm serious Call them. You just need to send a telegram... ...and I bet they'll come running! - The exchange is one to two - Listen... ...it's better if you accept the situation. We've both received a telegram So we're even - Where are the taxis? - At the exit Thanks. By the way, I'm very calm Are you free? Can you take us to this address? Very modern - A 60-metre concrete vault - A big factory - Come and visit me - Many thanks - Is the taxi ready? - This way, sir - Is Tristeno part of Dubrovnik? - Yes - That way - Are there any good restaurants? Excuse me, which villa is it? Margherita, they're here. They've all arrived at the same time OK, go and greet them - Where's the ammonia? - Don't tell them I sent the telegrams! No, don't worry. Don't say a word, just that I'm ill Margherita has always been a bit strange Nice place We're not alone anymore. There's three of us now - How are you? - Not too bad - Did you have a nice trip? - Yes, thanks - Who's this gentleman? - Of course! You two haven't met before Gaetano Mattia di Fucill?, lawyer Gianni Invernizza, engineer Nice to meet you - Margherita has told me about you - She's told me about you too Your mother is a friend of Margherita's right? Margherita is my friend. I like to take care of my friends personally... ...not through my mother - Let's try to keep calm If Margherita has summoned the three of us here, she must be really ill Must be To be honest, I'd rather be here on my own... ...but I would never forbid anybody from seeing Margherita I'm sorry, I am not aware of your feelings for Margherita... ...and I don't want to disclose mine... ...but we shouldn't go up to her on a war footing You're right, Gaetano OK. After you - After you - No, I insist Sniff this My God! What's going to happen? - It's a nice villa - It's not the best time to talk about it - Where's Margherita? - She's upstairs, resting. Speak quietly I hope that animal didn't make her ill - Who knows - Follow me, but be quiet After all, it comes from the jungle, and the jungle is contaminated What's wrong with her? - She arrived here feeling dizzy... - She's certain it's serious? Of course That's why she sent the telegrams Why did she come to Yugoslavia? I bet it was your idea Me? She dragged me here It's you. It's all your fault - After you - No, please, after you Margherita, I have a surprise. Look who's here to see you How kind of you Hi, how are you? Don't worry. We're here now Come on, Margherita. Aren't you happy to see us? I feel so ashamed But why? Because... ...I forced the three of you to come here all together But I really needed you Margherita, don't worry about that It's nonsense - Am I right? - He's right See? We've become friends Even Gianni and Gaetano - It was quite funny - Oh, I do apologise We were all on the same flight but we didn't see each other I met Michael at the airport, when I arrived. Gianni was already here You said you are friends but you speak so formally to each other Sometimes we get it wrong, but... ...look My dear old friend, Gaetano My dear Gianni. See? We all like each other. Isn't that so, Mike? If it was true, I'd love to get better... ...and be with all of you without any issues Where's Ren?? My dear Ren? So sweet, so lovely If you could be friends for real, I know I'd get better straight away - Are you all right? - If I could have all of you around me... ...in harmony as you are now - Wouldn't that be great? - Of course. We're staying Of course. Now we know what we have to do What a wonderful holiday we could spend all together Don't you think so, Gaetano? Of course It would be wonderful, wouldn't it? Everything you want, Margherita. But don't tire yourself But then why the long faces? I am so happy Aren't you happy? Here I am, miraculously cured! Gentlemen, she's been pulling our legs She's done a good job And you were a party to this. We'll talk again about this! - I'm not responsible for this - We'll see! What if I had called you to explain myself? Yes, but you should have at least called us individually Come on. Don't look at me like that - You tricked us - It's true, I lied to you But just to get you here I missed you and... No! It's ammonia! Don't breathe in, there's ammonia in it! - Don't touch me! - Throw it away! - Murderer! - He needs water - How much was there? - Quite a lot - It's all right - Here's some water - Wash your eyes - Do you think it will be enough? You'll feel better straight away - It's partly my fault - Don't be ridiculous... - Don't worry, it's just fumes ...I shouldn't have left it there Let's go back to the hotel What about you, Mike? Are you staying here? Maybe she's right, or maybe not. I want to try and understand - So I'll stay - Of course he wants to stay He's a pervert My case - Are you sure, Mike? - Let's go to the hotel Yes, I'm staying Don't mix with scum Well, now that we're alone... ...what are we going to do? - You have to go as well Either all or none First you invite me, then you chuck me out? I don't want to go It wouldn't be such a bad idea to stay here on holiday for a couple of days Yes, it might be nice - I was about to marry her, you know? - Really? What happened? I changed my mind at the last minute So, when did you meet her? It was through my mother, I didn't... I'm not saying I'm a mummy's boy, on the contrary... ...but you know mothers - they want to see you settled She said she was an intelligent girl... ...and quite pretty, so why not marrying her? You know what mothers can be like - Margherita chucked me out - He's back She said either all or none What is he doing here? I'll come around - What about women? - I don't care anymore. Cheers, to us! To us! I must say, there's one thing I like about Margherita Her honesty - The lawyer is appealing to the court - 16 degrees! Maybe "honesty" is not the right word Maybe I should say "loyalty". Another woman in her place... ...would have stayed in Rome and cheated on us three at the same time - Instead, she ran away and confessed - So we're cuckolded and happy Why do you have to say "cuckolded"? It's an obsession What are you trying to say? I want to take some of these bottles back to Italy It's very simple Margherita wants the three of us Did you hear that? According to this immoral person... ...a woman can love three men at the same time Where's our fried fish? Yes, because in a matriarchal society... That's rubbish! I have been to university too, you know? The idea of matriarchy makes me laugh Women are biologically inferior to men - Do you know what Plato said? - No Or maybe it was Rousseau, I can't remember now "The ideal family, and therefore the ideal society... ..."should be based on the freedom of the husband... ..."and the subjection of the wife" - Our sardines! - The service in here is awful I don't understand why tourists come here to Dubrovnik and spend so much Yes, it's a nice city - But it's similar to Venice - Is this a scale? Italian! Please, weigh yourselves - 100 kg - That's impossible - Are you drunk? - The scale is right - The scale is precise, it doesn't lie - Put it on 80 kg - How are you? - I've tried a new great restaurant I've eaten really nice fresh fish Ask him where we can find prostitutes - 90 kg. That's right - Good This is Mr Fucill?, a friend of mine from Rome Many thanks So, goodbye You're crazy - Why? - How do we find them now? - Oh, please! - They must be somewhere I don't know the guy, I can't just ask things like that. I don't want to find prostitutes, I want to go to bed. We're leaving tomorrow Is that Ren?? I don't want anything to do with you or Margherita. Bye - Come on, Renato - What do you want? Don't go away. Stay with us - Renato, come here - Come on, Renato I don't want anything to do with your Margherita You mean "your", not "our" Margherita - What happened? - That wicked woman. It's your fault - Did Margherita do that? - Who else? - If you keep laughing, I'm going - No, wait If she'd thrown that stone a bit harder, she would have killed me - But where's Margherita? - I'll take you there Drink up Give me the bottle - I want some, too - Who did that? Margherita? I suggest we go there and say hello as friends Just to be polite Do you agree, Gianni? - He's right - Yes, why not? We'll say hello, as if nothing happened, then we'll leave I agree, but let's be very cold - Yes, as cold as ice - That will teach her Young lad, do you like Margherita too? Margherita, do you like this lad? Our flight is tomorrow morning We've lost Margherita... ...and we've found plum brandy As we said, our plane only leaves tomorrow morning Didn't you find anything better? We're not drunk - It's a souvenir, right Mike? - Yes Ren?, join us! Wait - Ren?! - Here, Gianni. Drink up Listen, Ren?. Make an effort. Say hello to her Come on, let's go. Come Margherita, look what you've done to him Poor Ren? If it wasn't for them, I would have reported you You'll pay for this, sooner or later I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you Right on the temple I'm going back to Rome with them - Good bye - Good luck. Bye No, wait. Let's stay a bit longer - Wait - We'll listen to some music - I'm tired, I have to go back to the hotel - No hotel Gianni, no. We're not leaving Margherita, taste this brandy. It's made with plums Thank you - Ren?... - Drink with us. Drink Drink some more - Thanks - Mind you, this isn't a reconciliation - Isn't that right, Gaetano? - Absolutely - We're just friends - OK, Gianni. As you wish Here you are, Ren? Margherita, I'll forgive everything Can we make a fresh start? Margherita, I may be crazy but I cannot leave without you Do you know that those two wanted to look for prostitutes? But I said no I am different Listen, I'll close down the factory and sell everything We'll travel around the world, just the two of us I'm going to marry you, Margherita. I need you Where are we going? Come on, wake up! Come on, wake up, guys. We're here "Here" where? Don't touch me, Margherita. Gianni, help me A sportsman like you, tired already! Look at me. I am a businessman but I'm fine Today's sportsmen are different Mike, Gaetano. Let's make this clear I didn't object to coming here, but there was one condition From now on the three of us must respect Margherita We're here as friends Do we agree? - Yes - OK - He rebuked you, eh? - Let's go in! Come on, Mike, wake up Come on, wake up, Mike Instead of staying here why don't you go and sleep in your bedroom? It's ready Here, this is for you No, Mike... l'm tired If you don't want to make love, why did you wake me up? Tell me Why did you make love to Gianni this morning? I saw you I don't know Because he's nice, kind... ...and he still talks about marrying me So what? I was the first one Your first love You can never forget your first love Come on! You know you like it Wake up Close the shutters, please No, you have to wake up We have to make love - You have the same rights - What? - It's beautiful here - Do you like this? It smells great! It's butter - Pepper? - No It feels like spring over here Listen, where are Margherita and Gaetano? They're coming. You're lucky you could sleep I had to go shopping and rush through the housework - Don't you have a maid? - In the morning, just for cleaning But now you're here it's not enough anymore - I'll have to solve the problem - Come on We'll see Are you going to stay? Maybe For a couple of days It's a nice place and the food is great I don't see why we should go Plus, Mummy Ren? takes care of everything What do you think, Mike? Shall we stay for a few days? I'm OK with that. I'd already said that I would stay How cute! If only the Americans could see him. It's like Walt Disney! - Beautiful - Good morning, dears! - Good morning - Did you sleep well? Here you are What does this mean? What kind of joke is this? Can you pass me the butter, please? Thanks I am immoral You are immoral And he is immoral I'm sorry but I still don't understand You, my dear... ...yesterday morning on the beach. Method - sweetness That's right You, in the villa Method - violence Me, in my bed, taken advantage of Not bad We're missing a sign. Give me the pen You know what I'm going to write? "Bitch"! I am an amoral... ...not an immoral Let me remind you that we had a deal - Do you remember? - No I'm sorry but I didn't break the deal I have been taken advantage of We're only men. We can't resist temptations She should have respected us, in this case Plus, I was drunk last night I really don't understand. What does she want? Do you know? She wants all of us at her service At any time So she can take from each of us what she wants That's it We shouldn't even be discussing this! She's a mad visionary As far as I'm concerned, I don't understand jealousy And I think you are nice people to be around - I'm coming! - Have you seen my friends? - They're in the garden - What are they doing in the garden? Can I ask you what this is all about? It's your harem, princess I don't want a harem And I don't want to have to choose either. I want to be chosen and loved But that's impossible. We have already decided to be your slaves, am I right? Do you want to play harem? Very well - Sit down, princess - Let's play harem Please sit down, princess Spanish slave, the veil Lift up the veil Let our princess sit - Careful, please - Be gentle Shall we lift up the stretcher now? Slowly! Ren?, please help me carry the princess I can't! I am her eunuch! - Let's go, slaves - Take him away We're taking Madam Susanna for a swim Careful down the steps Who had this brilliant idea?

The landlady's friend Signorina Margherita. Italian. Sick Yes, Margherita. Italian. In the garden Take this off now. The light's beautiful We'll take lots of pictures and send them to "Playboy" My God! That's not my son! How awful! Maid, take me to see my son... ...Mattia de Fucill? No, hair down. Like this That's it. Don't bite me, little cat Naughty cat Here you are - This is your son's room - Leave us alone, please Oh, my God! What's the matter? You ask me that! What kind of man are you? Mum, what are you doing here? It's a disgrace! Don't say a word! Thank God your father is dead Yes, but you can't judge me like... Get dressed! Oh, my God. I don't feel well Mum, calm down You can't judge me like this, without letting me explain You liked Margherita and Ren? so much Mum, what's wrong? Come on, Mum You'll end up making me cry too Please It's good, isn't it? Wouldn't you like to eat it? Get your tongue off. This is not mould, you know It's seasoned Now the only problem is transporting it It's a rarity. We don't have this kind of ham in Italy If you add tax, you end up paying as much as you would for a Parma ham San Daniele ham is the same price I'm pleased to see you again - He hasn't done anything - Yes, he has - Everybody is a pervert in this house - Mum Calm down. I'll explain you later Mum, calm down, please What's wrong, Mum? The car is just outside. Can you walk? - Who is she? - His mother His poor mother Who called her here? Oh, dear - Are you talking about Gianni? - Yes Let's go and get some fresh air Gianni is her uncle He has nothing to do with this. Why do you think I accept this situation? Because you're madly in love with her No, it's because Margherita is cheating on the photographer with me You don't know anything. Put this on, it's cold You must look after yourself This is how things went Mike was Margherita's first love He came back after I met her, and he wanted to get back with her Do you understand now, Mum? I'll spend three or four days here I need a holiday every now and then, don't you think? Be careful, son Yes, don't worry - Only passengers on board - Yes, thank you - Bye, Mum - Bye-bye. Take care - No visitors on board - Have a safe trip Gaetano, promise me you'll never marry that woman Yes, Mum. Yes, bye. I promise you His mother came here thinking she would find her son engaged Or almost. If it had been your mum... ...can you imagine it? My mother is dead I think you're making a big deal out of nothing Stop acting dumb I consider Gaetano's mum as my own - As our own - True Where's your mother? - She left - What? You let her go on her own? - What else could I do? - Take this She doesn't want to know about me anymore. She left cursing me Poor woman - Where's Margherita? - She's upstairs Don't be too harsh with her. She's devastated She didn't even want to eat If you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room. I'm very tired We should all leave Do you realise how terrible this situation is? Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother... ...and hold fast to his wife... ...and they shall become one flesh We have made a mistake. Poor woman Why did she have to come here? - Can I switch the light on? - If you want to "The Triumph of Death", by D'Annunzio Giorgio Rispa is madly in love with lppolita... ... a woman he has shaped to meet his requirements... ... and suit his needs The dissatisfaction of this relationship is slowly consuming their lives Only isolation and contact with nature... And contact with nature... ... give way to feelings of regret... ... while the mystic aspirations... ... can't relieve the pain... ... caused by a string of sins, until death puts an end to it This is how she appeared A strong, intelligent courtesan who was inspired by grace Wonderful in her voluptuous aura Although she may appear to me in many different ways... ... her shape is outlined by my desire... ... and her shadows are produced by my thoughts The way she appears to me every moment... It's worse than a Hitchcock film There isn't a law that regulates the sale of these pills yet - Thanks anyway - I understand but... l'm sorry Margherita, you should have seen it! I've been attacked by... I'm not talking to you after what you've done No, Margherita, listen. I explained to you why I've done it I thought you'd appreciate it Why don't you want to accept it as a sign of love? I'll take my responsibilities Close that umbrella. Can't you see that it's not raining anymore? You shouldn't have thrown away my pills They belonged to me I want a baby from you Ah, very well! What's going to happen when the baby is born? Who is going to keep it? Me or you? Can you tell me? What do you mean? We'll get married Can't you take this as a sign of love? How many times do I have to tell you that I don't want to get married? Margherita, don't you think you're being too repetitive? Stop it! I don't want to hear you! Go away! - Where did you leave our friend Gianni? - In town - Did you find the pills? - They don't have them here Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find some tomorrow There she is. The superior woman Without the pill she's lost No more equality of the sexes, right? We're back to the time of cavemen - And the ancestral fear is back - Very good, Mike Of course I'm scared. Because you are irresponsible people It's the one who threw the boxes away Gianni, come here What's wrong? What have you done to the lady? Me? Nothing He wanted a baby, can you imagine? Margherita, please I really can't understand you, Gianni Can't you see? Conceiving babies in this situation! Who'd be the father? Nothing happened I don't even want a baby We'd have sorted the paternity issue in alphabetical order The first baby would be Gaetano's... G-A The second Gianni's... G-I The third Mike's... M-I The fourth, strange as it may seem, would be Ren?'s Leave me out of it, please So you all think that my main aspiration is to have a baby from you? You're just selfish and arrogant men Let's be nice to this poor woman, let's give her a baby So she'll feel happy, content She'll believe she's become important And let's also tell her that we're letting her raise our child Making sure to stress the word "our" She's even rebelling against the laws of biology It was a great idea to throw the pills all over the place! Gaetano, please, stop complaining I'm cold and angry When I throw things away, I throw things away - Hey, are you not joining us? - No, I'm not going to play this silly game I won't join you full stop There's no more respect You even trample on maternal feelings in order to achieve what you want And now you're bringing babies into this I disagree. And I won't allow you to make fun of sacred things Come on. You're mad Mike, have you found anything? I've found two See? With a bit of patience... He's found two Hey, look what he's eating What are you doing? Are you eating the pills? Open your mouth! No, he's not eating the pills Oh, look at this. Ouch! Stupid... Mike! Come in. The film screening today is "Naked Curves" You're not the only diva here. You have competition. Look You know, the job of a photographer is great It's good fun You obviously have to find nice and interesting subjects Margheritina, you're in the way. You're not see-through. Please, move Next one? - Take that insect off - It's a friend of mine - Do you recognise it? - It's the desert What is it then? - Our Margherita - No way! It's amazing what you can do with photography Close the door Mount Margherita And now I'll show you a lady from Hamburg I'll be the screen. Project the photo on my jumper - That's it - Here you go You can't fish when the sea's rough Who said that? I've caught one, haven't I? Madam wants to see you Come on, chop chop! This place is not a harem. It's worse than the barracks All done Fancy a drink, Margherita? The others will be right here - Do you want some, Gaetano? - Yes, please Why did you call them up? I didn't ask you to You didn't... ...but you complain about being lonely We need to be four bodies and one mind - yours A rare specimen because it's the only one - Fishermen... - Nice rifle. Did you buy it? So, we'll all go hunting tomorrow - Stop it - Look at them Very good. You're planning to go hunting while the lady suffers from loneliness I'm not suffering from anything I know that real friendship is between men I've introduced you, you became friends - Now I can leave - What would we do without you? Women are impossible to understand She was the one who gathered us here... ...but now she's jealous of our friendship So... You are very confused. You can't decide, actually you don't want to decide But the game is getting dangerous Careful, because they will make all the decisions for you - Can you tell me how it will end up? - No? - Women... l'll never understand them - She got bored of us I'm speaking for myself. But what do you think? Margherita is not in town Nor at the hotel. I don't know where to look for her anymore When she feels like it, she'll come back - I'm going to eat. I'm hungry - Me too Here's your coffee Wake up! Coffee time - Coffee anybody? Gianni? - Yes, please Hi, Margherita. We've been waiting for you for hours - Coffee? - I'm leaving You're leaving? - She's leaving? - She's leaving The lady does as she pleases I won't ask you where you've been I don't have the right to do it, but they are fuming I couldn't stand it any longer But you have to understand them. They spent all night looking for you I'm sorry - Are you really leaving? - Yes - Are you going back to Rome? - In a few days Did you meet somebody else? You did. I know you too well Who is he? Is he young? - Why do you want to know? - Well, if it's a secret then... ...it's the man of your life The problem is, today the maid is not even coming Well, you can do the chores No, Margherita! I'm tired of it. There's a limit to everything I'm a man too! I want to leave Sorry, I locked up to make sure the cheetah wouldn't get out Have a safe journey and be happy We'd like to apologise to you Can you accept our apologies? Answer. Do you accept them? Come on, make peace - Do you accept? - Come on. Let's part as friends We've made a mistake. Forgive us Forgive me You have to forgive me Wait, Margherita Only one last favour Mike's trousers You can sew, can't you? You're not a great housekeeper, but I assume you can at least sew Look, five buttons are missing Can you see what state he is in? You wouldn't leave him like that, would you? Only five buttons and then you're free to go Look how beautiful she is Tell her to prepare something to eat. I'm hungry He wants you to prepare us something to eat You will prepare us a nice lunch as a lasting memory A nice lunch. Margherita, the housewife Margherita, the angel of the house Of course. Our angel Lunch! - Hooray for the spaghetti! - Well done! Everybody - smell Is everything on the table? Salt, pepper, sauce? - Say when - As usual, there's something missing It's easy to criticise, but you can't find Grana cheese here - Wine, Gaetano? - Yes, please This is for Ren? From the smell I can tell it's much better than yours Pass the plate Are you not going to eat with us? Gaetano, pull up a chair Sit down with us, Margherita. Come here - Wait - Please Now that the lady has sat down, we can start eating Would you like some? - This pasta's not that great. - I'm only eating it because I'm hungry Then do what I'm doing... ...add some salt, and a bit of pepper - Ren? cooks much better - There's no comparison It's still rubbish Try some Have some, come on So you know it too Not even the cheetah can eat it. This spaghetti's crap! You can't do this to a lady Gaetano, don't get carried away now. We're gentlemen - I'm sorry - Margherita, I'm sorry... ...but a woman should at least be able to cook... ...but you don't have the faintest clue At least spaghetti. She can't do anything, for God's sake! Yes, he's right Come on, Margherita, at least spaghetti Don't you know that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach? Didn't anyone tell you that? You should have learnt something else apart from having sex Cooking is not that difficult after all. What can you do? Tell us What can you do? Fried eggs And steak See, Margherita... ...first we made you become a good housewife... ...and now a beautiful erotic object Do you know why? It's not for our own pleasure But for your own good To allow you to get back to your natural female status Sacred words Stand up and take the blanket off Do you want me naked? No, Margherita, not naked Don't overdo it We just want you to be a nice erotic object We're not pornographers Maybe we should ask Prince Charming what he thinks He's a man too... ...with his own opinions Tell us where this Prince Charming is We'll go and look for him, Margheritina. Where is he? Here he is - Prince Charming! Gaetano - a lawyer Gianni - an engineer Very good Mike - unemployed Name and surname What's his name? True... what could we call him? What could his name be? Tell us his name! His name is "Secret Passion", "Mystery" We'll just call him Mr X - Do you agree? - Yes First name, X. Surname, X The sun I am going to go now Wait a second! Before you leave we still have one more game to play The tower game It's a very interesting game A very revealing scientific test You'll like it too And it's very stimulating - Come on, let's play - We're ready Give me your arm Come on, princess! Come on, the tower game is fun Who are you? Where do you come from? What do you want? She's an alien! Careful, Mr X. She's an alien Come on. Let's hurry up with this game Margherita has to leave I am cold! This is salt We have caught the alien! And we're taking her to the tower! 'The Bridge of Sighs' Mind the step What an awful place. It gets worse and worse Hurry up, Gianni! We have to be quick! Here we are, on top of the tower Here Sit down We have here the lady, the tower and Mr X Now, Margherita... ...you are on top of the tower with your Mr X One of you has to jump to save the other's life Understood, Mr X? It's a nice test, but cruel. Like the Chinese bell one You win a fortune but the man dies They should do this in churches, before celebrating weddings So, Margherita, who is going to jump? One of you has to be willing to sacrifice their life for the other What do you think? Who is going to jump? You or him? Who is going to jump from the tower? It's obvious, men are more selfish But look at Margherita She'd like to jump but she's a woman Her feelings are decent Margherita, make a decision, then you can leave So, which one of you is going to jump? I don't want to play this game anymore Come on, be a good girl Once you start a game you have to get to the end of it Come on We can wait for days, but you can't. You're in a hurry It would be too easy to leave without making a decision - You have to choose, Margheritina - Am I the one you'd like to push down? It's the truth, you'd like to push me off the tower Come on, Margherita. Come You have to jump from here Do you see what women are like? First they use men, then get rid of them like old rags Women have always made sacrifices for men That's their real strength. Am I right, Mr X? So, who do you want to push down, Margherita? Me? You won't push me down! THE END Translated by Lorena Uras DVD Subtitles by International Broadcast Facilities
