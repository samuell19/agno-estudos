Niels? June and Jonny will be here shortly. Won't you go inside and get dressed? I've prepared your old room for you guys. Oh. He probably just needed some fresh air. Show Jonny the way. No, no, no. If they don't have a story it doesn't matter. Right. You might have a fantastic product. But if you aren't your product, you're fake. How are you, Dad? The bank manager was here, so Niels just needs to... Mum, let's talk about what you said on the phone. - Let's just... - Call me again tomorrow. But not between 8 and 9 AM. June and I will be running 15 km then. Bye. - I just had to close a deal. - Kiss... Do you have a new cookie, Dad? - No, June. - No. But if we are to save the factory, and we are, we have to think innovatively. Niels, Else. You're creating potential hospital patients. Looking at your cookies, people think, 'butter, fat, sugar, cancer, death.' What if we made healthy cookies? How about a slim cookie? - It's Jonny's idea! - Of course, it should taste good. I don't quite get this. - Taste good? What do you mean? - Dad. Calm down. Niels, I've seen the accounts, and they are... Like a view of the devil's arsehole. The bank will shut us down if we do nothing. If we have the guts, we can save the factory - - and save the nation from crowded hospitals and an obesity epidemic. - Niels, Niels! - Dad... - Should I go in there? - No. Leave him alone, June. I'm sorry, but as a bank, we can't protect the factory anymore. What are you doing? No, no! Sit down. Can you breathe? Here. Sorry... Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. No, don't... Are you okay? - You can breathe? - Yes. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Just leave. It's fine. - Bye. - Bye. FOR ELSE AND JUNE Hi, Sally. I tried making it look more snow-covered. The Supersnitte. THE CAKE DYNASTY Hi. Hi, Connie. Hi, Sally. - No, that can't be right! - Hi, ØB. That can't be true. June? You've grown all big and serious. 'There was a time when we launched the cinnamon troll...' - Hi. - Hi. Are you okay? Yes. Thanks for... Sure. Sure. Thanks. I think he's on his way. There he is. There was a time when we launched the cinnamon troll. No one believed you could eat troll cookies. People called them ugly. They had a silly name! However, we taught the Danes to eat... with humour. We knew that you don't just eat with your eyes. You also eat for the heck of it. So now, we will, once more - - redefine what a cookie is. We want to... Or we've agreed - - that we want to test a new kind of cookie. - A healthy cookie. - The slim cookie. A cookie isn't just a cookie. - A cookie is identity. - Identity? A cookie doesn't just say something about who you are. It also says something about who you want to be. So we have to look at this holistically. And we as a company depend on you employees taking ownership. On you identifying with what we stand for. - What's she talking about? - Excuse me? What the hell are you talking about? Good. Yes, yes. Can you handle a bit more? I like it. Else, do you like it? - You know she's praying, right? - Who? I don't know her name. In the warehouse. Religion is still a private matter, right? I've sent this note to the bank about our finances and new direction. - She's praying. - Yes, we... - Will you prepare your presentation? - Presentation? You're going to the refugee centre with the business club tomorrow. It's a splendid opportunity to tell the others about our new venture. - She's praying in the warehouse. - Niels. You have to do it! Come on, Niels. Do it! - The bank manager will be there too. - Jes? Hi. Do you have one of those... - An umbrella? - Yes. - Do you need a ride? - Yes. How strange... - It's never done that before. - You must step on the gas pedal. Maybe it's the ignition. Do you subscribe to a roadside service? Do I subscribe to a roadside service? Only Else would know. Hi. My name is Else Agger. Our car broke down. Yes, we're on the Boulevard. - The Boulevard. Borgsø. - The Boulevard. Borgsø. - Good day. This is Falck. - Hi. Is there an Else here? - That's Else. I'm Niels. - My name's Else Agger. I think the ignition is dead. Do you want to come along? Let me hear it. I want to change! - Say it. - I want to change. Louder. Good. The consumers don't trust fat people. It's an instinct. When you see a fat person, you think, 'At times, you can't control yourself.' 'When you just lose control and eat, eat, eat...' Nice and easy start. Double jump and then... Well, come in. My family likes to hunt. - Would you like some tea? - Sure. I'll sit down. Of course. Here you are. It's... - Like that. - Yes. It was my grandma's. She gave it to me when we fled. It means, 'My child, love will find you in the end.' - That's beautiful. - Yes. Forgive me, it's just... - Yes. - Thanks. Yes. Tea? - I thought you stopped eating sugar? - I did. When we release the slim cookie - - we'll reinvent the cookie market. You see, a cookie isn't just a cookie. A cookie is identity. Identity. Which kind of identity? - It can tell you who you are. - Who are you then? It's because June went to business school. June? Your daughter? - Do you also have children? - No. - Hi. - Salam. This is Haidar. This is Niels, my boss. His car broke down, so I invited him here. - Niels Agger. - Haidar. - Children's birthdays? - What do you mean? - With balloons. - He works as a clown. - Oh, as a clown? - Yes, at the mall. Sally weighs 133.7 kilos. - Connie... - Weighs in at 125.5 kilos. Doesn't it work? - 158.3. - I'll get a marker. FOR ELSE AND JUNE June? - June! - Yes. - How do you guys know each other? - We were betrothed before we were born. Our parents arranged the marriage. Then I had to wait until she came of age. That was when she was nine. We were married. Then I found out she wasn't a virgin. Luckily, I knew a doctor who specialised in hymen reconstructive surgery. 'High men'...? Hymen. We had that done, which was good. Then I didn't have to stone her. - I'm joking! - Sure. Yes. - We aren't married. - No. Well... - Are you married? - Yes. - Where have you been? - The car broke down. Oh... I had to... call the roadside service - - and he had to take the car to the garage. - Did you walk home? - Yes. Hi, Dad. Dad, I think Jonny and I can help you get the company back on track. - So we can get some peace of mind. - It was the car that broke down. Mum says - - that you had discussed that maybe you should go to a psychologist. - I don't know anything about that. - It might be good to talk to someone. - No. - Goodnight. Sleep well. Goodnight. Sleep well, Dad. Ready? Doesn't take much to get her mad. Hi. - Is something wrong? - I'm sorry. There was a... tear. I'm sorry, but I didn't think it should just stay there. I stayed at my uncle's in Sweden, but he passed away, so... So I came to Denmark, to my family. My dad built the factory. He was a baker... Like me. But then he died, and then I had to take charge. Then we invented the Snikkelsnurre - - and things were going exceedingly well. We won the Danish pastry gold medal. And we went to the mayor's office. - Do you have a favourite cookie? - Oh... I really enjoy marzipan. I have a thing for spongy cookies and marzipan. Do you have a favourite? Yes, I like kleicha. - That's good. - Yes? - It's a dry cake. - What was it called? - Kleicha. - Kleich... Kleicha. Kleicha. Kleicha. Niels? June has made a suggestion for your speech. You probably need to practice it a bit. - Dad, I'll do it. - No, it's fine. - I can do it. No worries. - It's fine. - Well... - How are you? I'm fine. There's the mayor. Oh dear... - That's good. - Yes. Okay. - I have to ask you about something. - All right. What is it, honey? - The timing is bad... - Just say it. I went into... There's Jes from the bank. We'll go bankrupt. No, we won't. Hi! - Are you in high cookie spirits, Niels? - Yes, we are. - Come. - We're coming. Dad, take a deep breath. It'll be okay. - I'll be right behind you. - Yes. Okay. Don't worry. I'm not going to sing! In Denmark, most people are not defined by religion - - not by ethnicity, but through their work. We have therefore arranged - - for you to come out and work at our local industries. That can give you a wonderful opportunity - - to get to know Danish culture. Therefore, it is a great pleasure for me to now give the floor - - to the CEO of our cookie factory, Niels Agger! First of all, I would like to warmly welcome you all to our country. I also think that it is our responsibility - - to give you an idea of Danish values. One core value is 'hygge'. Hygge is a Danish word connected to relaxing - - letting loose, free speech, telling jokes and... Sharing cookies. Right now, as we speak - - a new type of cookie is invented. Whenever you eat this cookie, you will lose weight and become slim. - So this is a slim cookie? - No, you will become slim. So if I eat a lot of this cookie, maybe I will disappear! She means how will this slim cookie represent Danish values? I guess you should visit the factory - - those of you who have a cookie dream inside. - Yes. - Thank you. No. Dad! Oh dear... Do you still swim? Er... We agreed on this, didn't we, Niels? Is it...? I can't say for sure, but change your lifestyle, or you'll go bankrupt. - What? - Are there worries I should...? - How do you know about that? - About what? - What you just said. - Niels, deep breath. We can't do a turnaround of the factory with Niels in charge. - You just need to help him. - Mum, it must be passed on sometime. Jonny and I are ready to... I'm not sick. I can manage. - You collapsed, Dad. - While the bank manager was present. - And Mum says... - What? I think you should stop navel-gazing, Niels. We're doing this for your sake, Dad. - But I think... - I feel splendid. - Okay. I found this, Dad. - What's that? What is it, Niels? Huh? Huh? Dear Else, dear June. I've always thought that people who committed suicide were weak. But now I've prepared a rope. I'm sorry that I can't cope anymore. That my character is so weak. My dad didn't think I was capable of carrying his coffin. 'You can't do it without crying, ' is what he said. But you must carry my coffin, and if you were to stumble - - and put down the coffin to catch your breath, that's fine by me. June. I have so many memories from your childhood. Our trip to Rome. The ice cream that melted in your hand. The red dress you wanted, and when we saw you wear it, we understood why. I apologise, June - - that I was too awkward to give you the love and attention you deserved. You guys would tell me not to apologise, but I must. I miss you already - - thinking of the darkness I will soon surrender myself to. All my love, Dad. Niels. You need to retire, Dad. The bank would prefer that. It should happen smoothly, also for the sake of the employees. Yes... So if you could just sign this. - Good morning. - Good morning. I just wanted to apologise about your headscarf. That we... I took it. That wasn't okay. - Did you like it? - What do you mean? How about you start wearing a headscarf? - No, I don't think so. - Why not? You looked beautiful. - No, I'm a feminist. - So I'm not a feminist? Isn't it a feminist's duty to defend women? - But it's a symbol of oppression. - So only your way of life is free. - Everything else is wrong. Am I right? - No, that's not what I said. - It's a symbol of oppression. - So why are you wearing a bra? - Well, it's practical. - So it's not a symbol of oppression? You can be a feminist and wear a hijab. Just like I can be a feminist and be in a porn flick. You were? - Many. - Many? - You're taking the piss. - No. You aren't? - You are! - Yes. - Is it because of the weight? - No, no. No. No. We feel that... Or I feel - - that it's difficult to see you as part of that profile, or future... You're fired, Connie. - Fired? - Yes. But I've been here since I was 17. - What does Else say about this? - She wants what's best for the factory. Hey. Yes. That's right. Dad, you should consider this. We want the factory to have a more international approach. So we're thinking 'Borgsø Cookies'. 'The Cookie Factory' is an obvious name for a cookie factory. Maybe Granddad couldn't think of anything better. We're sticking to the local level with 'Borgsø' - - and going international with 'Cookies'. Shortly, a journalist will drop by - - to see how we make the cookie of the future. And it's important that we don't just present a cookie - - but that we present a new story today, together. So when the journalist arrives, we should train and look like we enjoy it. What's going on? We need to get her out of here. Okay. Thank you very much! This is a workplace, you know. Johannes, would you get the mop and all the cloths? Well... I talked to... I talked to the journalist - - and he said it would be good if I just did the interview. - Okay. - But he needs some photos. Shouldn't I be in those photos, as the future frontman? - People can read that in the interview. - But if it's just with you... I'll say you're part of it. I promised Mum to get dog food. - Could you do it for me? - Yes. - I'm the future CEO. - Of my factory. - Your factory? - Yes. - I'm the Managing Director. - That is the CEO. Letters don't matter. You're wrong, honey. Those letters do matter. If they're that important, you can be the COO. FAIR PRICES Hi. What are you doing here? It turns out we have so much debt that I probably can't save the place. I should probably kill myself now if I only knew how. - No, don't. - I was kidding. It was a bad joke. I'm sorry. You want to join me? Its dates. Yes... - And butter. - And butter. Is it good? - You can help me. - May I? - You're a good baker. - Well... I can't do anything else. - And then you roll. - All right. There. My mum and dad loved kleicha. My dad created the Snikkelsnurre. Now, I'm making them too. I don't think this slim cookie is who you are. No. I like sugar. Like I always say: It's full of sugar and fat. But baked with love, it only fattens a bit! - He didn't get any dog food. - Why not? Where did you go? Well, I... Lots of different places. It was more like a... trip from place to place. Don't you think it would be a relief for you - - if you made the announcement that Jonny and I will take over? - Can we discuss that later? - Niels... - It's good to see you're doing better. - Yes. Good. We'll discuss it tomorrow. - Well... - Yes. Here's our broccoli slim custard tarts. - Wow. - How exciting. - Should we...? - Let's go for it? Very delicious. Good acidity. It lacks some sweetness. Okay, come. Put your hand over here. Yes. It should be here. Here? - There. - Yes. Bismillah. It's nice. Yes. Come. Are you okay? It must be disembowelled right away. Yuck! Yuck! No! - I've got my eye on you! - I'm taking it! No! - No. - No! I'll get you! No, we can't... Zeinab... I'm in love with you. - But you're married. - Yes. But I can get a divorce. I'd like to marry you. - Can I trust you? - Yes, you can. What? You're beautiful. Wipe your glasses. Yes. - What are you up to? - What? What are you doing with him? - He proposed to me. - But he's married. He says he's in love with me. - Didn't he try to kill himself? - But he's happy now. - Are you looking after yourself? - Yes, I am. I don't think you are. What about your child? I'd like to ask for Zeinab's hand in marriage. That's not for me to decide. Well, I'd like to convert. - Are you circumcised? - Yes. Or no. - Do you have foreskin? - Yes. You can't sleep with a Muslim woman if you have foreskin. Well, we haven't been doing that. We haven't. - I know a guy who can help you. - Okay. A doctor? Calling him a doctor would probably be a stretch. - Are you in love with her? - Yes. Very much so. - You must take good care of her. - I will. Niels, I can't dissolve a marriage. I can't. That's haram. This is the cookie that will save the factory. - What will Else say? - Don't worry about that. When Else tastes this cookie, she will understand. - Else knows everything about cookies. - But nothing about us. Also for Monday? Good. Don't mention it. Bye, bye. The cookie doesn't taste good. I think we're launching it too soon. - Taste is subjective. - It really doesn't taste good. You just have to get used to it, like Schwip Schwap. - Shri Shop? - Schwip Schwap. When they mixed Cola and Fanta. Hey, June. - So you got some dog food? - What are you doing? What? I was just... I saw you kiss the cleaning lady. No, no. I just saw you two kiss each other! - It's not what you think, June. - What do I think then? Hi! June, I'm in love. - I'm in love, June. - No, you're not. Stop it. And I can't do anything about it. I've proposed to her, June. - No, you haven't. - And I must convert. - No. What are you talking about? - I have to. Don't touch me! What's happening? You're out of your mind! Stop it, stop it! What are you doing? - I can't... - Just stop it. - There's something else. - Just stop! This cookie is a fusion of the Middle East and Denmark. It can be sold both there and here And yes, it makes you fat. But I don't believe in all this slim nonsense. I believe in that cookie. That's the cookie we must teach the Danes to eat. It's our new venture. The slim cookie's already in the paper. We can't change our strategy now. - What's going on? - We'll be making Islamist cakes. - Zeinab, come. - What? The cleaning lady. What's she doing? - This is Zeinab. - Hi. Zeinab, could you mention the international thing? I think that we can achieve a big international breakthrough. - What do you mean by 'we'? - Sorry. Zeinab made the cake. Niels, what's going on? I've offered Zeinab a big managerial position. What do you mean? June's going to be CEO, and I'm going to be COO! Jonny, you're fired. Dad, let's talk about this! We're going to conquer the Middle Eastern market. They love it when we Scandinavians embrace the Middle East. Can we talk to Niels a moment? Just the family. The strategy is set. - We need to talk to Niels. - Can you leave for just five minutes? - I think you should tell the truth. - I've said what needed to be said. Okay. Dad... He kissed the cleaning lady. Yes, we're in a relationship now. But let's talk about our new venture. What did you just say? You weren't meant to find out this way, Else. - What...? - I'm in love with Zeinab. She's restored my faith in the factory. And he's proposed to her. Okay, what the hell are you saying, Niels? Proposed? You weren't supposed to find out about it like this. Niels... Else... There... You pig! But before they place their order, they'd like to visit the place and... They'd like to visit us and see the workplace conditions. And regarding that, I'd like the factory - - to appear more Arabic. So I thought about you, Haider. Could you...? - Be a brown figurehead? - No, no. Could you lead a group of employees that I hire from the refugee centre? So a kind of manager position? Let's say Head of Department. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. May I come in? - Certainly. Please have a seat. - Would you like some tea? - No. Right... Did you know I was his father's secretary? Really? I didn't know that. You know, I noticed Niels right away. I was a bit older than him, but Niels knew what he wanted. I understand that. No. You don't understand. You don't understand what you're doing to Niels. He can't run the factory without me. You know, I... I'm in love with him. You're using him! He just can't see it. He thinks you're in love with him. Leave. Go. - Please go! - Come. Sit down. You're so beautiful. I realise touching you must be a different feeling. But... But I can't live without him. I can't. Promise you'll leave him alone. I can't. But I can move in with you. - What? - Yes. All three of us can live there. You don't understand, do you? - No, wait. - You simply don't understand! What's going on? That was his wife. Niels' wife? What are you going to do? I don't know. - Salam. My name is Ali. - Salam aleikum. My name is Mohammad Khalit Mustapha Ahmed. But you can call me Mohammad. - Hello. My name is Zina. - Hello. My name is Sarah. Yes, my name is Sally... Sure. How can you hire so many after firing Connie? - We didn't fire Connie to save money. - As I understood it... It's also a question of finances, as we are on the brink of bankruptcy. The municipality subsidises us. They cost less than Connie. How many refugees did you buy for Connie? - Is one of them her cousin? - Yes, he works in human resource. ØB, they could buy ten for you with all your supplements. Ten! Stop! We'd like to demonstrate that we're a factory - - that stands for integration, with a multi-ethnic profile. And I may as well announce now that we'll celebrate both Christmas and Eid. - What the hell? - Eid is just a fast. It's a Muslim way of identifying oneself with poverty, as I understand it. Understanding other cultures is healthy. I don't want to celebrate Eid just because we have brown colleagues! Not even with municipal subsidies. They must adapt to our culture! It's important - - that we consider our language when contributing to the integration. Yes. Of foreigners. Or... Not foreigners. That sounds so foreign. That's why it's important that we don't say 'them' about them. - You constantly say 'them'. - Then what are we supposed to say? - Us. - 'Us'? Yes. Us and... us too. 'Us' and 'us too'? Exactly. That way you demonstrate solidarity - - as well as a difference. It's a bit rude speaking Arabic while you're here. Speaking just one language must be hard. - I speak English too. - Then let's speak English. Let's tease him. So what's your opinion on sugar? - Sugar? - Yes, sugar. It's bad for people. We believe that in the West, sugar is used to control people's minds. The state or companies that run society - - make people addicted to sugar in order to control them. You really come to my country and talk about control? Whoa, whoa, ØB! Everyone can eat what they please. Of course, Niels... You've bought it? - Why do you want to convert? - Well, because of Zeinab. - You mean for love? - Exactly. Allah adores love. - You won't get water in your hair! - No. No, I just imagined that I could leave this place as a Muslim. When we say the Shahada, then you'll be a Muslim. But do you mean that you want a Muslim name? - Yes! - Rashid. - Yes? - Rashid. - Rashid? - Yes, that's a good name. Is it then 'Rashid Agger', with the surname? - Rashid Agger. - No, isn't it 'Niels Rashid Agger'? - Niels Rashid? So you can...? - Yes. - Niels Rashid Agger. - Rashid Niels Agger. Yes. Rashid Niels Agger. That's how it's going to be. Thank you. - Just repeat after me. - Yes. There is only one God, and Muhammad is His prophet. - Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar! - Allahu akbar. Congratulations. Rashid Niels Agger. He loves you. Do you intend to tell him... about you know? - I'll have to. - Yes. First, I lived in Sweden, before I met Niels. - Over here, we have our prayer room. - They are all religious? More or less. - She wants to taste a cookie, honey. - Didn't she just taste one? She wants to taste another one! - Niels! - Else? Come in here, please. Let me take you to the small Italian place. I'd prefer you eat me first. - We got the Iranian order. - Come here, so we can celebrate. Taste me! - Am I your little baker boy? - Yes. I'm in the mood for something sweet. Niels, I know we've had a rough time. But don't you think we can change if we make an effort? We'll need a bigger bed as well. I think it's fine. - If there are three of us... - Three? Yes. Zeinab told me she'd talked to you. About what? That she'll move in here. She likes you. She's using you! Don't you get that at all? The new strategy won't work without Zeinab's cookies. It's your own choice. That my husband lets me down with someone like that? - Am I boring? - Well... You have to admit that it's been many years since our last coitus. When I wake up in the morning and look at you... I really hope you're dead. But you can't even manage that. We may both have grown old and fat - - but you've grown bitter as well, and no one can love that. Niels. Niels... Tell me you love me. I need you, Else. Don't you love me anymore? I love you. Good. Good. But it's possible to live together in other ways. - Hi. - Hi. This is for you. Thank you. Aren't you going to open it? Sure. It's nice. It's the Hand of Fatima. The eye in here will protect you during periods of transition. And of course, it's gold. Thank you. Thanks. No, let me do this. - Go tell Niels we'll eat in a minute. - What are we having? - We're having chicken. - Chicken? - That's good. - Yes. - Would you go get him? - Niels! I don't think he can hear you. Niels! - It's delicious. - Thanks. - How are June and Jonny doing? - They're doing fine. If it weren't for June, the factory would've gone bankrupt. Did she learn about 'being' your product at business school? I know a little business myself. I helped my family back home - - who sold a little... - I can't do this. - Sure you can. No, I can't do it. - Do you really think she loves you? - Else. Destroying a family is haram. And Allah says that love can be shared by more than two people. No, no... No. You know what I was thinking? I think it would be good for us - - if all of us were Muslim. It would fit well with the rebranding of the factory. Niels? Niels. Can you just approve a delivery? - I have to fix this... - Two minutes. Thanks. Thank you very much. - You should taste these. - Yes... This one has hazelnuts. Thanks... - It's 100% halal. - Yes. Fine. - Thanks, Zeinab. - Yes. I don't think Else is feeling well. No. - There's something I have to tell you. - Yes? - Niels? - Yes? - The factory called. You need to go. - Now? Yes. - Do you smoke? - No thanks. Me neither. I can't... Come, come! Breathe. There, there... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The other day, I made a little joke. Then one of them threatened me. You fiddled with the compass, so our butts pointed towards Mecca. - They've no sense of humour... - Don't poke fun at people's faith. Then how do we get through to them? I realise it's tough when we're hiring new staff - - but our business is undergoing a radical change. - Weren't they hired to save money? - We're rebranding our factory. We must all adapt, so we can stay on a common path. Yes, but at times, there is no common path. Sometimes, there's no 'us' and 'us too'. Sometimes, it's just us and them! Not if you want to keep your job. Habibi. It was Al-Jazeera. - Really? - They want to talk to us. - Niels and you? - No, you and me! It's a great story in the Muslim countries. That we're a family business trying out other cultures' way of life. - That story will sell the cookies. - Wait. I have something for you. - Al-Jazeera? - A giant platform for branding. That will give us the major contracts. - No, that won't be necessary. - It's strictly business. May I? But I'm not going to say anything, right? No. Just say it like it is. But how is it? Well, you're tired of the tabooing of religion - - and death and other kinds of questions in life. You're wondering about the tsunami of depression, anxiety - - and mental dissatisfaction pouring in over Western societies. Well, they've adapted to us for a hundred years, Else. Now, it's our turn to adapt to them. - Or is that too much? - Yes, maybe a bit. I'll write a script for you. Okay. This is an amazing chance. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, everyone. - Hello, everyone. - Good morning. - Good morning. - It's been a while. - It... - It's been a while. - It's been a... I am glad to see you. Oh my... I am... - I am glad to see you. - I am glad to see you... - I am glad to see you. - I am glad to see you... Yep. - Hi. - Hi, Dad. - Come in. - What's happening? Where's Mum? - We're doing an interview. - Where's Mum? In there. She's being interviewed by Al-Jazeera with Zeinab. Come. - Did you know they'd be here? - No. Wow! I'll be damned. - Here, have one. It's a sawda. - What? It's a chicken liver with a very distinct aftertaste. - But you get used to it quickly. - No thanks. I think I'll wait for some herring. Maybe there's schnapps? - There will be schnapps. - Lovely. - Hi. - Here's our Easter table. Hi. There are some very funny traditions about this Easter table. For example, the rolling of the eggs, hunting the bunny. But it also marks - - Jesus' death and rebirth. One of Allah's many prophets. Well... Well. That was it. My wives will show you out. - This way. - Thank you for coming. - Is it lamb? - Yes, with paprika and chili. A bit of chili. And za'atar. It's a spice. - Okay. It's delicious. - Why are you wearing that? It was better to wear a scarf during the interview. - Don't they expect that? - I don't know. It's respectful. - But you look beautiful with it. - Thank you. June, do you like the food? You're not eating. It's very delicious. Jonny, do you like the food? How's work? No, I have to say it! It's too weird that the three of you live together. - We don't care what others think. - But it's weird. - We take care of each other. - Sure. Okay... But you don't seem well, Mum. You're not happy, are you? June... Mum just tried helping you and the factory, and then you do this. Okay... I'd like to thank you, June. And Jonny. You've taught me much. And I'd like... to make a toast - - to making ends meet and celebrating Easter as a family. Both Else, Zeinab and myself - - want to overcome all the difficulties and succeed with this. - Inshallah. - Inshallah. As such, I'm so happy that Zeinab has become part of this family. Thanks. And that she has accepted becoming a shareholder with me and Else. - What? Is Zeinab a shareholder now? - Yes. What the hell? So now she's worming her way into our family? Is she going to take over my grandfather's factory? June, you have the right to blame me. I'm okay with that. But you two couldn't deliver the necessary cookie. You couldn't! You almost destroyed the factory! Zeinab provided that cookie, and she deserves our gratitude! - Let's eat... - I'm leaving! I can't take this anymore. I'm leaving. Sorry. - Are you coming, Jonny? - June? - No! I'm leaving now. - June. - Take that scarf off, Mum. - No, June! - June, come back. - No, no! You're not doing well. You need to leave this. The factory has started selling cookies again. - June, stay. - No, no, no... Yes? - Hi. - Hi. Sleeping in the living room feels strange. Well, at some point in time - - we were going to try it out, even though it feels a bit strange. Strange? Well, I don't want to, if you don't want it. Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. WOMEN IN ISLAM 8 STEPS TOWARDS A HAPPY LIFE APPLICATION FOR FAMILY REUNIFICATION - I don't understand... - She has a husband in Iraq. And she has a child she wants to bring up here. How do you know this? I read it in her documents. - Haidar! Where's Zeinab? - Is something the matter? Does she have a husband and a child in Iraq?

I've wanted to tell you something for a long time - - but as time passed, I found it harder and harder. I have a daughter in Iraq, Aida. She lives with her father's family.

After we met each other at the factory, it may be possible - - but I don't know if you and Else want this. It's a lot to ask of Else. I hope you will understand and forgive me. I love you. Zeinab.
