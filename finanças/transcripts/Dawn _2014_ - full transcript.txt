First person plural, masculine. I'm from Romania. I'm speaking Romanian and Yiddish. The sun here in Palestine... It's the exact opposite of Europe. Day and night. No, please don't... No! Father, you have always been against the State of the Jews. But what they are doing here is good. There‘s enough space for all of us, for those who are still alive, and of course, for our dead. You will always stay with me, father, together with mother and Esther, I promise you that. Elisha! They're learning Hebrew. Right. Get the milk canister, will you! I will turn the light on. No. Not yet. Elisha, what is wrong with you? I don't know. My face, maybe. Exactly. Exactly what? You're too good looking. You get remembered. People notice you. What‘s he doing there? - Thinking. - Well, don‘t. Unbutton your jacket. You're hot. The curfew is now effective until dawn. David Ben Moshe The Brits... very punctual. Unlike our radio speaker. This is the Voice of Freedom. Tonight, we speak to the British government: David Ben Moshe has been condemned to hang. He would die like a Jewish soldier, with his eyes open. We have taken possesion of an English officer. You know his name: His name is Captain John Dawson. Now both lives are in your hands: If one dies so will the other. And as this terrible night passes, we will live and wait in hope of an agreement: the life of our comrade, against the life of your officer. We are one hundred. You are a hundred thousand. But not one of you can rest easy that the nights of Palestine will not swallow you up forever. To Captain John Dawson's mother, we say this: we are not murderers, we... David ben Moshe's death would be meaningful. John Dawson's not. David is a hero. Dawson a victim. And somewhere in this city, two men wait for dawn, waiting as we are. Waiting in hope... Why do they play this tune? They‘re not. It‘s the English. They‘re jamming us. - Don‘t worry about her. - Wait! - Put them away! - It will be a long night. Put them away. Not now! So what shall we do? What we can. Lish can make tea, Gideon will pray, and you can be quiet. - Lisha! - Sure. And pull the curtains. I don't want to see this night. So the story goes... About God again - A rabbi once... - Just come to the point, Gideon. I prayed for David ben Moshe. I prayed for David. For you and for your friend. David was everyone's friend. No, you're different. You grew up together. You were like brothers. That is a different prayer. Then pray again. Here. Make yourself useful. Maybe it's all a bluff, you'll see. The phone will ring. He'll walk away free. But I don‘t think so. Do you? Joab, keep your thoughts to yourself. Forget him. It's just how he is. You start. I'll dry. Press-ups. One hundred each. - How about it, Tarzan? - Will you be quiet? Seven. Then a story. Who can tell a story? I can't help it. That's how I am. Go down and see. It's a nice gun. I've used it before. - Never mind! - And it's all clean. Go down! Now. How long have you two been together? Over four years. You get used to anything, after a while. And you even come to like it. Why Joab? Why what? Why him? Why don't you ask him? He knows how to frighten people. It's Ilana. The nightingale... Hello Lisha. Are you mad? There's a curfew. Were you even followed? A single woman in empty streets. Idiot. Didn‘t you hear my broadcast? I had to leave. Hello. Why here? For him. Do not harm him. No whispering! Gentlemen... Sit down, it's ok. - Does anyone have a watch? - Yes. - That wasn't the question. - What then? It's two to eight. In Germany, they used to play marching songs. At least you knew what you were up against. That‘s our music for the evening, I'm afraid. Anyone want to dance? I didn't think so. - Shall I get that? - Leave it. What shall we do? - Tell us a story. - You want to hear a story? You wanted to tell a story. We have to pass the night. That's why we‘re here. You start! Tell us a story. - I don't have any stories. - Of course you do. All of us do. Tell us about freedom. What does it mean? Leave him alone. He'll do it when he feels ready. Forget him Lisha, he's just an idiot with a big mouth. What's with the code? - What code? He's still learning Hebrew. - Like you. I'll tell one. - No. - For Elisha. About God again? - But you know this one. - That makes it better? You're in it, Mr Valentino. We have a deal, ok? You'll be quiet. An English officer. Quite a prize. Reverse. I thought you knocked him out? He must have come to. New at this job, are you? They have thick skulls. We're in trouble. That's when I saw her. This girl on a bicycle. She reached into her bag, and dropped some oranges. A kind of gift, I thought. That's not what they saw. Grenades! These Brits; constantly nervous. It's said, that sometimes God comes down to earth in form of a child. You're mad. That's why I love you, man. - But you never told me that. - What? - You know what. - What? Don't play the idiot. The cosh! I've learned. What do you think, Elisha? I think... what happened to the officer? Remember the 11th commandment: "Hate your enemy." There're only ten. You know it. You're a Jew. That's why. Or ask the man. What man? In the cellar. What? What man? Take it down. See for yourself. What man? A man. Hungry, I should think. You know where the cellar is. Just take the tray down. He thinks we're kidding. - And we are. - Of course. Stop playing around. It's Dawson. Take the tray. Go on. Actually, I think you should. I'll help with the trapdoor. Lisha... Why wasn't I told? He'll want to talk. Try not to talk too much. They have no stories. Remember. In fact, don't talk at all. Wake up! I'm not asleep. Food. My name is John, - John Dawson. - I don't want to know who you are. Room service. Maybe not. It's good. Are you just staring at me? May I at least know your name? Elisha. Disciple to Elijah the prophet? Healer of the sick. - It's no your real name? - It is! It is? Then it's you, is it? You're the one, who intend to kill me. No. No? No. No-one does. Your government needs to spare David. I see. Why are you here? In this cellar? You should tell me that. In Palestine. I don't want to be here, most of us don't. It's British government. That's what you want, a government of your own. Yes? If you get one... Watch out. I‘ve had enough, thank you. Do you believe in eternity? I believe in God. It's the same, isn't? What happens to me here, will stay with you for a long time. Do you understand that? This God of yours, do you think he approves? Yes. He is a freedom fighter. God is a terrorist. Did he talk to you? He didn't make sense. Are you sure? What were you doing all this time? Watching. Getting to know the enemy? Watching him eat. Did he make you laugh? No. He tried. Lisha, at all times, remember David. Remember the rope. Yes. But why are you whispering? Are you willing to do that? What? We‘ve all seen action. We‘ll see it again. But a defenceless man, locked up in a room. They‘ll hate us for this. They hate us anyway. Good idea; a bit of air. You should eat something. Don't... I remember that taste. We do what we can for those we love. I don't think this is the time to talk about love. Maybe not. What's out there? What else is there? Where's your family? You know the answer. I know I'm not welcome here. I came for you. Elisha, you're blushing. You don't have to blush. Ilana? They turned off the water. Why would they turn off the water? Sometimes, I wonder... If it came to it. You know, the rope. Will it be thick? Kind of rough? Too tight? Itchy on your neck? Like a shirt collar that's too tight You'd want to scratch, but your hands are tied. That's what you wonder about. Too much waiting, I suppose. You'd have better things on your mind, I'm certain. I'm not so certain about that. Sure, you'd stick your chest out, like on a parade ground. It's called courage. When it's not called fear. But the little things, you don't have. Thoughts. Like the itch you get, before you pull a trigger. Do you know what I mean? Are you going to kill him now? No. He's just going to tie his hands. No. I'm not going to tie his hands. You are. Pardon me? It's ok, Elisha. We're here. What does that mean? It's you. That's why we're here. Forget him. Impossible, I'm afraid. I envy you, Elisha. You've been chosen. - Or we can call it an order. - Go to hell! When it's over, we'll dance in the streets. All of us, hand in hand, in a circle. In the daylight. And we'll have a home. All of us, a home in each other. I don't dance. You will, when the time comes. We'll be "a beacon to humanity". That's what they said in Command. Sure. Ask the guy downstairs. Stop Ilana! This is no time to dance. Stop! Power cut. They‘re toying with us. Wake up. There's gunfire. It's miles away. Idiots. They'll shoot at anything. Leave him. Better he sleeps, than thinks. Maybe he shouldn't go down again. He isn't ready. Bullshit... He's vulnerable. This is war. No sentiment! So when it's all over, can we have sentiment then? Will that be allowed? I will serve God and suffer trials. What's so funny? - What's troubling you, Gideon? - God He's talking about God again. When it's all over, when the time comes to lay down arms, I will go to where it began, the town of the patriarchs, Hebron. And I'll build me a house of good stone. It's dusty out there, my friend. - Do you have a better idea? - The future. That's just another opportunity. Like what? To grab something. Like what? Anything. Each to his own profession. The future, and a normal life. Of petty crime. So what brought you here, Joab? What did you do in Casablanca? Sell the Eiffel Tower or only hashish? Call it a change of air. Yeah. On the run. - No. A normal life. - You don't know what you're talking about. What does that mean? None of us has ever had a normal life. We'll have to figure it out. What do you do in real life? This is not real life? And you? The stage or just hairdressing? Let's not pretend to like each other. About time we did that. Damn! Who turned that on? Who? Joab, do something normal. You'll feel better. Tell us the time. We've waited too long. That's the time. Are you listening? It's time. Tie him! I'll decide that. Then decide! What's stopping you? Will you shut up. Come on. I'll go down with you. No. Not this time. Is it time already? No. I've come to tie your hands. - Why? - Because it's necessary. One more thing. Something has changed. They have decided, haven't they? It is you. I'm sorry. Please turn around. How old are you, Elisha? Nine-teen. Almost twenty. Almost twenty. I have a son your age. But he's noting like you. He likes to eat, dance, laugh, go out with the girls. He has an easy life, none of your worries. I'ld like to write to him. Do you have a paper and pencil? Please! A letter from a father to a son. A final letter. Do that for me, please. Who's there? You? Don't... Don't turn away. Who's there? Who were you talking to? My father. He was here. With my mother. Then others arrived. More and more. Even from the camps. They were all here. Stop it. There's no-one else here. Some had their backs to me. Stop it. Are you unwell? No. Why? Elisha, tell no-one about this. Not even Gad. Do you understand? Why not? If you go on like this, I can't predict the outcome. What outcome? You're not yourself. Why were you waiting? There's always someone waiting. Did you come downstairs to listen? Only to his voice. I mean, the sound of his voice. Ilana, what do you want? They say thoughts are clearer at night. What do you think? It's dark here. Let's join the others. I would like to ask you something. We can ask the others. You came to talk to me, didn't you? I've changed my mind. Let's join them. It's better that way. My question doesn't concern them. So what do you want? A kiss. What? I'm sorry. Ilana's kiss... her recruiting officer. Paris. You've forgotten? No. I haven't forgotten. We met. You were like a phantom. I kissed you so you'd remember. You had to know the future could be beautiful. And desirable. I haven't forgotten. The kisses, Ilana, how many others for our goal? You're jealous. Not any more. How many other men? It was necessary. Did you kiss them in the same way? Sometimes it was even... quite nice. And those who died here? How many? You took a while. So? So... So it's decided. - What's decided? - Stay out of it. - What's decided? - You decided. Don‘t make it hard on yourself. This is war. You know that. You were trained for this. That isn't war. It's reasonable. It's murder. It's only reasonable. These two, they don't love us. They don't love us at all. Him, he loves only himself. And him, he loves only his God. But they'd lay down their lives for us. They'd kill for us. No-one else will. No-one else in the world. We've seen that. And these two, they'd expect the same of us. It's perfectly reasonable. What a speech! - Can you do better? - How many have you killed? I kill with my voice. Let's get on with it. Look at him. He isn't fit to do it. Give me the gun. I'll do it myself. These weren't your orders. Let's face it. - He shouldn't be here. - Let them do it. What do they care? Killing, it's a joke to them. They weren't chosen. That's all. Orders. As a test. - Also a test. - To test my weakness. To test your strength. To give you strength for what lies ahead. Lisha, there's still hope. For David, and even Dawson. Till dawn. What are we waiting for? You know how to use it. It's in your keeping. What's dawn exactly? Dawn is a phone call. But there's hope. From London? At four in the morning? From the English cabinet? In bed with its prostitutes, dreaming of breakfast? Your turn, Captain. Storytime. It's not appropriate. - For a man of secrets. - For an officer. I was there from the start. Operations... I've lost count. Why are you in charge here? Can you answer that, Mr Officer? You're sly and vicious. You're more useful as you are. Just tell a story. Keep him happy. I warn you, he's no good at it. So tell us something nice and not vicious. Something we don't know about. Tell us about peace. Peace? Go on, Gad. It was a beach... empty. An umbrella.... lying on its side, two towels on the sand. I went round the umbrella. The sun on my head. Just the sound of the sea, the wind, the waves. Like... the sound of a woman breathing in her sleep. This was my peace. Perfect peace. That's it? No. I wish. It wasn't my first time. But each time, it's like the first. The same test all over again. I stood, and I waited. And after a while, I heard feet on sand. What was I supposed to do? Kill a shadow? I knew this man. He came through the Paris office, with his wife. This wasn't his wife. Each man has his principles. Peace is a value. Pacifists, they have their principles. Only, they infiltrate and inform. Pacifists get you hanged. As I squeezed the trigger, I said, "God forgive me." I'm not sure if God heard. God heard you. Maybe. Maybe he won't want to. You have to find an answer in yourself, any way you can. Where are you going? - To the classroom. - Why? - I'll be back. - I'll come. No. It's ok. Let him. - You know this guy? - No, please don't... - Yes, I know him. - So take a hit. No! Take a hit, bud. It's your call. Turn the light off. What's wrong? He's doing it. - You don't need that. - He needs it. Do you know what you did? What if they'd searched the school? - You deserve more than that. - So shoot me! Here. - I have my own. - Use mine! Use mine. I'm going to tell you a story. Are you mad? Yes. The story is you. You are the story. Hurry. They'll hear. Remember? - Eat. - Eat? Who are you? You've been following me for a week. Say I was curious about you. I'm not your kind. Please take the sandwich. I'm afraid I'm very much your kind. Being the whole time hungry in the camps, you forget how to eat. Please, eat. - You‘ve been to the camps? - No. but I'm a Jew. Do you have family? Is that your business? - And you? Do you have? - Yes. Safe. In Palestine. There is no future in Europe. You want to go back to Lodz? Stay here in Paris? There‘s a new family waiting. I‘m part of it. It's called the Hebrew state. How do you know this? - Sorry? - That I was born in Lodz? Never mind. You'll know in time. - You studied. - Is that important? Of course. We need translators. Just as we need planners. And killers. Elisha... Eat. And you ate, you ate, and ate... - They'll hear us. - You haven't stopped eating since. I haven't heard you laugh since then. Not until this moment. - What's wrong with you? - I'm tense. - You? You're never tense. I'm tense. Still, that's no way to handle an officer. Or a brother. Do you remember when we first met. Before we met I was a God-loving Jew. When Ilana asked: are you ready to cross the sea, what did you answer? I agreed. - And the reason? - You know the reason. It's standing in front of me. So, are you ready to cross the street? What happened? A man and his dog. Obvious. Dogshit. No-one likes dogshit at home. Not overnight. Thugs. Ilana... - What? - The corpse. It's moved. The dead, after a while, they just get on your nerves. The corpse. It's moved again! He's right. Look, it's on its feet. Staggering like a drunk. Can you hear it? He's unfit. I told you. What are you doing? I'm going down. That's against orders. Breakout number two. No, he understands now. Father? Father! What's with the paper? Right. A final letter. Only his wife and son. Why are you asking? That guy down there, it's all nonsense. - You can't know. - Of course we can. We need to know all about him. Details. You want to hear? Item one: married. Item two: wife, deceased. Item three: one son, deceased. Both 1941. Bomb raid, I guess. Idiot. He's messing with you. - He'll say anything to weaken you. - No. No what? - You're messing with me. - No. Now you're being the victim. He's talking to his dead. I've seen it before. I'm going down. Bloody telephone. Do you know what that means? No. How could I? Three rings: There's still no deal. The next call will be the last. Sure. Comfort your enemy. But remember orders. Next time, take the gun. You kept your promise. Yes. We always keep your promises. Like your promise to kill me? Joke. Please, sit. "Dear Martin, Those who I fight, I do not hate." May I see it? Good. You're educated. He'll notice your handwriting. "Those who I fight I do not hate", new line, "Those who I guard, I do not love." It's a poem. One of his favourites. I taught it to him. Where is your father, Elisha? I see. Now then, you know how he is going to feel tomorrow morning. "My son, we shall not meet again. For that I am very sorry. I do have known you and I do have had the opportunity to watch you grow into such a fine young man. Go to university." Exclamation mark. New line. "Kiss your mother regularly. She needs kissing. And thus above all, be certain that I... that I love you and always will. This Thursday, Thursday October 16th, in Palestine. Written in the neat hand of my assassin." Another joke. Just put: "Your Father." I don't have the price of a stamp, I'm afraid. Will you send it? - I will send it. - You won't forget? - I'll do it today. - Thank you. May I have a cigarette? You need the address. Write it on the back. "The Old Rectory. The Old Rectory." You can smoke it. "The Old Rectory. Barnaby. Sussex. Great Britain." Sounds rather grand, does't it? But it isn't really. It's all I can afford on a teacher's salary. But it's home. Steps up to the kitchen, where my wife lives... I need to go. Don't leave me alone, please. Come with me. Please, come. Dawn. Gad, please. Do you remember the last time you saw him? Of course I remember. Describe him. Describe David. Of course, but... I can't remember his face. What was he wearing? Tell him, Elisha. Gad, you've got to stop this. We have to go next door. You've got to take the phone call. You're the only one they'll talk to. Gad? They've done it. We'll come with you Elisha. To the door. The town's waking up. - We must hurry. - Wait. Give him time. He'll come to his senses. Time? There is no time. Gad! Gad, I understand. You're not thinking straight. This is no time for pity. Gad... You can have your grief, my friend, but have it later. You have to go down. When you come back, I'll look you in the eye. There‘s the gun. Gad. Gad what? What are you talking about? Killing Dawson won't help David. It won't bring him back to life. It won't bring anybody back. - So we kill for the future. - No. We kill from love. It's reasonable. Isn't it? Perfectly reasonable. Father? Mother! Do not judge me. Judge God. What's he doing down there? I'm going down. That was loud. That was damn loud. We proclaim the foundation of the Jewish state on the land of Israel.
