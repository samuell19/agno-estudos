Unit four, this is Moonbase. Can you update your position? This is unit four. Heading down in one of the subsurface corridors. I can't see where I'm heading exactly. It looks like it has no ending. All right. This is Moonbase. Go on. Report back when you see something. Moonbase over. Moonbase, this is unit four. Looks like there is something. The corridor ends here. Okay, this is Moonbase. You are to hold and record your position. I repeat. You are not to go any further. We-we have some kind of communication problem. It's really strange. Unit four here. Can't understand. What are you talking about? It looks like some kind of door. Should I approach? This is Moonbase. You are not to go any further. That is an order. I repeat. Hold your position. We have strange readings. Very, very odd. Unit four? Unit four? Unit four here. I'm in the room, it… It looks like… Unit four, this is Moonbase. We have a problem. A strange fog is approaching. It's very odd. Don't do anything. Don't touch anything. Unit four! It looks like it has a spherical structure. As if it were kind of… Unit four. Unit four? The fog is here. What-- What the-- Hey! Are you okay? What the hell was that? Where are we? That was because of the fog. Look around. It's almost here. Now you don't have to run. It's everywhere. It blows up and destroys everything. There must be a way out, huh? I know what you're thinking. That it can't be true. But I guess you're wrong. -I was wrong, too. -What the hell is this here anyway? How the hell did I get here? This isn't normal. The only way to get here is through there. But I wouldn't go there if I were you. It's even more horrible there. And the fog is going to eat you anyway. But it's a way out then? Right? Sorry, but the fog is here. We don't have any more time. It was good to see you though. -Goodbye! -Hey. Hey! Come in, Jack. Jack, do you read me? This is Moonbase. Come in, Jack. Come in. Is anyone there? Can't fucking believe this, man. This is Moonbase. I need you to report back. - What the… - Can you copy that? What the… I can hear you. Roger that. Jack, what the fuck are you doing down there? You're scaring the shit out of us. No, I know it's, uh… It's pitch black here. The lights are gone. What? Can't you see what's in there? Yeah, you got it. Jack, you took that shit again, huh? Are you out of your fucking mind? No. No, there was this… We're all gonna die here on the fucking moon if you don't find it. I blacked out, I think this… What the fuck… What's-- Uh, wait, wha-- Jack? Can you see anyone? They're not here. They're not here. One of those strange corridors again. -Keep searching. -I don't… We are all talking about a spherical room. Moonbase, are you there? I can't hear you. Something's blocking the transmission. Jack, do you hear me? That fog is almost here now. It's everywhere. If we can't find it, you have to find that room. This is all we have left. Did anyone else come back? What about the old man? The old man? Moonbase! -Moonbase-- -No. We only found an unknown body here on the moon surface. M-most likely dead. Shot. Killed? Who the hell is he? What the fuck is in that room? Whatever it is… Whatever it is, it's our only chance to survive. We've lost contact with everyone. I repeat, there is no contact with Earth anymore. There's just-- There's just static. We're just getting static on the radio. Someone must have fucked up really bad. Jack. Jack, are you there? The fog is almost here. Ev-Everything is fading out. I-I'm only getting static-- I'm only getting radio static. You have to find the room! The fog is here. It's here. I can see something. I can see it. Can you copy that? Hey. What is this? Where am I? There's no need to be afraid anymore, man. Snow is already falling, my dear friend. It's all over the city. What city is this? What the hell is this party? East Side. And it's beautiful. What's beautiful? You're not really here are you? The machine is real. We almost made it. Almost made what? The old man is fucking evil. We had the chance to find the breakout point. He fucked this all up. - What are you talking about? - Betrayed us all. Who betrayed you? Why? The old man! The fog's out there in the city and everywhere else. This must be it now. Say goodbye to the breakout point. What breakout point? What's an old man got to do with this? What are you people doing in here? Aren't you afraid of the fog? I'm not afraid anymore. I'm glad I found this place. I'm glad to be here! What is it about this old man? What is he doing? He was at the power plant by the city before the fog came. What's he got to do with all this? Oh, he's very, very mysterious. And evil. But it doesn't matter now. Let's enjoy this party while we can. Look, man. You should enjoy this. There's nothing else you can do now. Cheer up, man! Maybe this is it already. I'll get some more stuff. Stop fucking disappearing, man! We've been waiting for you all night. Where the fuck you been? You've been down to the forest? Down the road? Don't tell me. You've really been down there? -Huh? -What, masked man? Who are you anyway? What forest are you talking about? Do I know you? That's fucked up! Fucked up. You gotta let go, man. It's not like this party is gonna last all night, is it? Stop worrying so much. - Let go of what? - I'll get you something. Come on, let me get you a drink. Come on. Let go of what exactly? Man, you on some wicked shit, huh? Come on, give us some of it. What shit? How do you know me? You always had a wicked sense of humour, mate. Come on, let's dance! Wait, did you put something in my drink? I can't remember anything. Not that you'll need your memories. Don't look now, but there's the most beautiful fucking giraffe right there. Don't start going mad now, too. Stay with me. I'm trying to put it together, but you're not making any sense. Come on, stay with me. You don't have a clue, huh? Ha! You haven't been out there in the fog, have you? Fuck me. If I'd made it back from there, I'd be getting stoned as well. Believe me. -Go drink. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Listen… -No, you listen. What the fuck you think this is, a fucking birthday party? What are you talking about? The last party in the world, man. This is it. I'm glad you made it. Everybody who's anybody is here tonight. This is some exclusive shit right here. What last party? What last party? We all came here to die, man. The black fog is everywhere now. This must be it now, at last! We've been all let down by the promises of the cave near the village. Well, here's your chance. Make the most of it. The cave's a lie. This is gonna be real. Let's rock on! That's insane! What cave are you talking about? That feel real? You waking up yet? Don't think about the cave. It's over. There is no magic cave anymore. What cave? What village? What forest? You told me about a cave. Y-you're all insane druggies, right? What about this cave? Drug addicts? -Wish I had some drugs now, man. -Okay, that's it. If the fog is almost here, why don't you just fuck off out of here, huh? There is no way out. There's no fucking magic cave anymore. Just this shit here. Let's presume for a moment you're not insane. You say that this one is, uh, a magic place here or what? Look, that's the only thing left for us. The fog is everywhere. I guess you figured that out already. Look, buddy, think about it. Something's wrong here, we both know that. T-There's a starting point. Now I believe there must be way out of here. Maybe you're right about that cave you mentioned. -We have to leave, okay? Let's go, it's-- -Are you fucking out of your mind? This is it now. I'm not going out there! What the fuck? Sh-- What… Shit, I'm not gonna die here! Aah! Hey, are you okay? What the hell was that? Where are we? We're at the end of the world. We're over the city. The party is over. The fog is here. It blows up and destroys everything. We need to find a way out of here. Find a way out, huh? Well, there could have been one. But you can't get there. It's too far away now. It's too late, man. What are you talking about? You have to tell me. You know something, right? We need to get out. Well, if you insist, there's a machine up the road. It's something extraordinary. It might be a way out. But even if you get there and get inside, you'd probably never come out again. But it's a way out then. Right? You'll have to find out for yourself, I guess. I'm here for the fog. It was good to see you though. - Goodbye! - Hey! There is nothing down here. Still no sign of anything or anyone. Keep searching. Whatever is in that spherical room, we have to find it. Can you get me an update on unit one? How did he get lost? We've-we've sent him down and lost him right away. He never replied. He didn't come back. But then he was back on the surface a day after. He died a couple of hours later. So what happened? What are we missing? He ran out of oxygen, his brain… He-he lost his mind. He wasn't himself anymore. He was saying incoherent stuff, mumbling. What? He told something? What did he say? He didn't say anything meaningful, just fragments. He was-- He was just still mumbling about that room. We need to find that fucking room. Was there anything else he said? Anything you could understand? Only-only fragments. And he was also going on about people. Creatures. Monsters. Monsters? What monsters? Creatures without faces. And these monsters were about to get him and everyone else. How can there be anyone inside these structures? We're in the moon. It's not possible. Yes, but that was why that fucking old man came. Interesting, isn't it? Who the hell is he anyway? The old man? H-he came from the station. To investigate. To investigate the situation. I always knew he was up to something. Why did he come, really? We're-we're not sure. I think he believed all that crazy shit that unit one told him. He believed in the monsters. H-he believed that the spherical room is really there. What the fuck is in that room? Unit one said those creatures… M-monsters that came from somewhere else… Some other place. From where? Where else? Moonbase? Moonbase, are you there? Freeze! Don't shoot me. Don't move. Why the hell did you kill those people? What's going on here? They're from the village. They're evil. What village? What is this, a war zone? No, we're near the village. We're too close. They're killing everyone who gets that close. Uh-huh. If it's so dangerous, then what the hell were you doing there? I was looking for a way out. I heard there was something really special down there. -They say it can take you away from here. -I heard about it. Is this why these people want to kill everyone, hmm? Listen, they know we're here. They'll kill us if we don't get the hell out of here. Look, the only way out is there. You know that. The fog is almost here. You can't get there, and they might be right. The cave might take you to the moon, but it might have started the fog. So it's true. It's really there. What are you gonna do there? Huh? That's the fog there. I heard about a different place. A big party in the city. We have to go. They're close. -We need to go. -There is nothing that way, only the fog. The only way out is there. - You're gonna die there. - No, you're gonna die. Hey. Hey, wake up. Are you okay? And what the hell are you doing? Oh, hey, man. Sorry, I was just away for a moment. You're coming to the party, right? I thought I was alone. I heard it's gonna be awesome, but no one else turned up. Where the hell are we? What fucking party are you talking about, huh? Oh, man. The party for all of us who stayed. But then you're not here for the party, I suppose. Never mind. This might be it. Yeah, it's a bit strange how there's… It's a bit strange how there's nothing there, isn't it? A bit strange? What the hell is it anyway? Are we dead? Where the hell is everyone? Are you lost or what? We're on the East Side, you know. You remember now, huh? Great. East Side, huh? Which East Side, hmm? Oh, man. Have you been drinking or what? This is the city here. Don't you remember? No. No, I don't. What's wrong with the world? You're really not here, are you? I don't even know where here is. Then I guess you don't know what happened here. No, I don't. No, no. The fog, man. It turned up and then everything just disappeared. Everything stopped. - You know, I think we're alone here. - Huh? I'm afraid there's nothing beyond the fog anymore. Someone must have fucked up for it to end up like this. There must be a reason for this. I'm afraid I know who started all this. We were working on something when the fog happened. We were working with the machine. We started something really promising, but guess what. He went completely mad. And then bang. I mean, that was when the fog started to cover everything. He started to shut the whole thing down. Then it just happened. This is all that's left of the world. Almost unbelievable. Come on, take a look at this, yeah? Come on, I'll show you. Come on. Everything's just stopped. It's all standing still. I never thought we could end up like this. This is unbelievable. Hold on. Wait, I don't understand. Who is it you're talking about? What is this machine? Oh, it's not just any machine. It's a machine they found on the moon years ago. It's a quantum machine. Infinitely more powerful than any other kind of machine. You can run millions of simulations on it in a blink of an eye. What? Okay, uh… What simulation? A world simulation. We wanted to find and locate thebreakout point with it. If there is one. So you say you can copy the whole world inside the machine and find this point there. Then exit with the knowledge and go there straight in the real world? Huh? Yes. Exactly. That's what we wanted to do. Find the breakout point. If there really is a breakout point, of course. But since you can run an infinite number of experiments in a split-second, you don't have to worry about that. If there is one, you will find it. At least, that was the plan. We never got there to run the experiments. Experiments, huh? So what is this breakout point anyway? It's a portal to something beyond this universe. You can't imagine. If this is true, then tell me more about this program. How does it work? We send someone in. He has only a finite time, let's say 24 hours, to find the breakout point in there before the cycle repeats itself and the program restarts. Again and again until he finds the point. That's how we wanted to do it. Even if there were some problems. Problems? What problems? Once you're in there, you forget you're in a simulation. But hopefully you remember everything once you get out again. Just like when you're dreaming. Looks like we're already dreaming it. I'd better wake up then. We have to get to that machine. We gotta… do something. Fucking hell. What the fuck? Shit! Does that machine still exist? It might still work. But the old man locked it down. Is that man still there? Probably. But we should keep out of there. The old man went totally mad. He locked himself up in there and kills anyone that gets close. I barely managed to get out. We should go there anyway. He will just kill you. He's evil. Just get me there. I can't see any other way out of here. Okay, but I warned you. Are there any other problems with that program? You can never know. We never had time to test it properly. And now the fog is here. Wait for the fog. Wait for the fog. The fog is good. It's the only way out. You're not going to die. Real life starts here. Everything until now was an illusion. Have you ever thought about infinity? How do we know the universe was finite? Or how could we say the opposite? We were living in the dark ages, my friends. In a world of illusion. We all believed in the cave. You felt there's something more. A divine beauty. They told us there's something beautiful out there. That it even takes you to the moon. But can you see the moon now? Is there something? There is nothing. I hope you can see it now. Those who jumped in are nowhere now. Gone… forever. The day the first wind came I felt lucky. Like every one of you did. And I can't blame you. After all, we found it. But think about it. Each and every one of them stepping in made this here more foul, more dark. You thought you can make it better, huh? You still think so? Has anyone made it? I don't think so. Are you feeling better now? You still think it can't be any worse? It'll always be lower and lower. Lowness is infinite. Be patient. We haven't reached it yet. But fear not. The world of the dark shadows looks frightening, but it's not the end. It's only the beginning. I saw the cave a long time ago. I am the one who saw the fog coming. - It started a long, long time ago. - Come here. And there is no way anyone can stop it now. We have to destroy the cave. No one should enter. If the world's gonna end anyway, why do you want to stop people fighting it? There are people out there who want to stop the coming of a new age. - We have to get him. - They can't stop anything. We're fucked if he destroys the cave. The fog is coming and you're not going to fight it. - We need to get to the cave. - If anyone comes close, - you don't let them in. - Where is the cave? They are not going to get through anymore. You can't save them. You have to stop them. Otherwise this shit will never end. You have to stop them. You're not gonna get me. You're not gonna get there. Not gonna get there! You're not gonna get me! You're not gonna get them! - It's over. - What? He's going to destroy the cave. Goddamn it! You're gonna stay here! Die. Die here. Don't bother getting closer. It's over. The lights will be out soon. Because there's no such thing as the magic cave. It's a lie. What? It's not what you think it is. It's quite the opposite. The fog is the only way out. What? I don't-- I'm here to make sure that no one enters. The cave is a lie. A lie? - You've been tricked. - But-- You have… a choice. What choice? Think about it. -Whatever, old man. -Bye. Jack. This is Moonbase. It's over. There's no way I can believe the fog can be stopped now. It's not over. We're still here. I need more info about the old man. When did he disappear? Right after we sent down unit two to search for the room. That's when the old man disappeared. Just vanished. He never came back. So did unit two. And then unit three. And you know the rest of the story. That fucking old man must have done something with them. Jack, it's really close now. The fog… Are you still there? That spherical room must have had something to do with this breakdown. If that started this shit, it must be able to stop it. We have to find it. The room is… Must be some kind of a portal. If it's a portal, where does it take you? The old man suggested it wraps up the fabric of time. Right. This fits the picture. If that's true, it might be able to take me back before. Before the fog. Jack. It's almost here. I can't see anything but the fog now. It must be over. There must be a way to reverse the process. And it's in that room. Wait! The lights are out. Jack, do you read me? This is Moonbase. Come in, Jack. Come in. Is there anyone there? Are you sure no one followed you? Yes. There's no one out there. Shh! Are you sure? Yes. There is no one out there. I hope you are right about that. We shouldn't let anyone come close. I told you I came alone. We need to check if the generators still work. So you haven't started it yet? Why is that? Why is that? Go and see it for yourself. The machine is in there. You know we need to put the new code in first. -The last cycle hasn't stopped yet. -Ah. The new code. And this time it's bug free, right? Do you think there is a solution to everything? This shit is going to cause some serious trouble. No one ever came back. No one ever. This means that it's going to loop forever. We have to shut it down. Admit it. This doesn't work. You can't know that. The breakout point is a lie. Bollocks! Think about it. The code is still defective. But I don't think that's the real problem. Yes, it doesn't work. But why is that? Have you ever thought about that? What if it never should have worked. You're talking gibberish. Okay. What do you hope you can find in there? You act like some ten-year-old who still believes in fairy tales. We all know the rumours about the magic cave. It's the most childish bullshit story I've ever heard. Stop it. You know it might be true. I tell you what's important to me. To stop this shit before it really gets us into trouble. And what if stopping it would cause a problem? You know what? Let's go in then. I'll show it to you if you don't believe me. It's over. This place is pretty lifeless. Is this the end of the world? Well, yes. The fog is almost here. Why are you still here? Aren't you afraid of the fog? Well, no. It will come and it will erase everything. You and I will wake up at last. Then give me something. Give me a beer. I see you got through the forest. -Must have been hard to get through. -I guess you could say that. So, I've heard something special is here. Can you tell me where it is? I know why you're here. You're lucky to be alive. I hope you're not here to see the magic cave. So? Why? Can you tell me where the road leads to? It leads to the fog. It is the only thing that counts. The magic cave is a portal to hell. You won't get there anyway. Good evening. I don't think you should talk too much to that man. I'm looking for a way out before the fog gets us. Can you tell me where this road leads to? That is a very special place here, man. There is something special out there. Did you know that? I guess you're not talking about the fog out there? No. But that fog is going to wipe out everything soon. And there seems to be no way out. And almost everyone is gone. That's the truth. What about it? Huh? But I'm not talking about that. You know the cave at the edge of town? They say there's something so beautiful down there. It's almost terrifying. Can you imagine that? You heard about it? One of those urban legends. People know that here. Is that why you're here? It might be. Is this what you're looking for? I only want to make it before the fog gets here. Well I guess we want the same thing. You know… I'm from around here. I used to live here when I was very young. You know, I had to live in the city later, but this is really my home here. And that's really good now because I know this place inside out. I know there's a way out of here. I know a very special place here. It's not far away. Come on. Get up. I'll show you the way. Come on. There's a small meadow here. With a massive ancient oak tree. I used to feel really special when I came here in the morning and lay under the tree. When I got home in the afternoon, I wasn't just fresh, but euphoric. I felt great. It was wonderful. I knew I had to go back. First I thought it was because of the fresh air and the silence. No one bothered me, right? I went back. And I went back the next day. And the next. It became an addiction. Not like Jesus coming back from the dead or anything like that. It just felt fabulous. You can't imagine. But over time the feeling faded. It was still there, but it wasn't the way it used to be. Maybe I was getting used to it. Maybe the place was starting to lose its magic. I knew that people had been there. I felt their presence. And then they started to disappear. You know, when I was little I always heard rumours. -Hmm? -Uh-huh. You know that story. About the cave. Then I realised the cave entrance is right there by the old oak tree. Only you can't see it. You have to be made aware of it. By the cave itself. One night I went out there to get to the meadow. I saw nothing, but I felt a breeze like someone was there. Huh? Who the hell was that? Good question. They won't let anybody here anymore. They're scared. Frightened of the cave. You realise we are in danger, right? They accepted their fate. They believe in the fog now. They've all turned into monsters. We don't have much time. They'll find us and probably kill us soon. I can hear them coming. -The villagers. -The only way out is there. You know that. -The fog is almost here. -Whatever we do, we can't turn back now. - Fuck. They're here. - I'll try to hold them here. Quickly! Go on! You thought you could enter the machine, huh? Well, you won't. The breakout point is a lie. You've been fooled. We've all been fooled! Stop! Why is it a lie? Why are you doing this? 'Cause it's only a restart point. If you would get to the point, the whole thing would start again. How can you know that? If you enter, then we are fucked. - You can't know that. - Well, I can. I can see the truth 'cause I remember that I've been here many times. I remember entering the point. Then why are you still here? It did nothing. - This is insane. - It just put me back. Why would I believe you? Because this means two things. A, we are already in the program. Yes. B, the machine in there is not what you think it is. It's exactly the opposite. It just restarts everything. What about the fog? We're dead if it gets here. What about the fog? Don't worry. I believe there's a real breakout point. It must be the fog. It's the fog. Just wait for it. Hey! Don't leave me here with the fog. Hey! Hey. Hey! Hey. Who are you? What are you doing here? What the hell? Hey! Are you okay? It's just an old wound. Don't go in there. It's not what you think it is. So it's true. It really takes you back in time. This… This… The spherical room, it takes you away. Back in time. But how come you're here? You shouldn't be here. I'm here because there is no before. I… You can't go back to before. It can only take you… back after and you'll have no choice but to start it. Again. But the fog is almost here. We need to go back. Maybe even stop the fog happening. Or at least do something. Hey. No. No. We… We need to go. Hey, hey, hey, come on! We ne-- We need to go back before-- We-we need to… You-- Whe-- Hey! Come on. We need to go back to before. No. Oh, no. Oh, no.
