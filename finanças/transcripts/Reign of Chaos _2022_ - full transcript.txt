It began centuries ago. He started as an entity, gaining more power with every infected soul. The world thought it was the next plague, but it was more. He is the god Chaos, self-proclaimed, of course, escaping the realm of chaos, a void between Heaven and Earth. He defied the gods of ancient Greece, spreading diseases and blasphemous ideas of revolution. Olympus fell many centuries ago, as Zeus and his fellow gods faded like burnt stars. With no gods to wreak his vengeance upon, Chaos sought those crafted in Zeus's image, the humans. With his herd, Erebus and Nyx, he infects and destroys. And those lost souls become joiners. Their roaming has spread the plague further. Slowly, the world is being consumed of all human soul. Most of the survivors escape the cities and live. Many fall when they return to cities to scavenge. The only hope lies in the bloodlines of the goddess Nike. Only they can bring an end to Chaos. For centuries, the Phalanx Knights were guardians. I've read the scriptures and heeded the warnings that for millennia the seers have predicted. We have sought out the Nike lineage, prepared them and trained them, waiting for the time Chaos would return. The time is now. But slowly, he is seeking out and eradicating the bloodline. Only a few remain. These three women of the Nike bloodline have been under my tutelage for a while now. It's not often I come across a family, but these three sisters have trained for this moment. Chaos does not wait until his enemies are ready for him, no. And the end of days waits for no man. You are too important to lose! We go, now! Your sisters are lost. No! Don't! - Give it to me! Give it to me! - No! Stop! No! Wait! Lock her down. I want to see her face. No! Your last breaths will bear witness to your blood escaping, and I am one step closer to ending your wretched bloodline for good. My minions will drink it, feast on it, and I will bathe in it, increasing my power with every drop. No! This is your legacy. Pathetic. No! No! Nicole? Dad? - Are you okay? - Dad said my name! That's, that's good. I don't want you to get your hopes up. He still isn't aware of his surroundings. Just please, don't expect too much. I know, Mom. It's okay. It's just nice to hear, that's all. Besides, if we can't get food soon, none of us will survive for long. The nearby wood has been picked clean of everything that wasn't rotted. Sorry. Failed. No, you did your best. What else can we do? Those things out there are growing in number by the day. I need to go back into the city tomorrow. Oh, no, please, no. Please. We're gonna find a way. We can check the lakes again. We can't afford more wasted days, Mom. We need some food and we need some medicine. It's too dangerous! I need to go further this time, old industrial sites, maybe raid a warehouse or two. If they've not been picked clean. I can argue, but you won't listen, will you? Sorry. I need to do it. Mom! Leave me alone. What is it? Don't touch me! What on earth happened? Wait. What? - I've got some food here. - Really? What have you got? Plenty. Maybe I'm feeling generous. You'll give me food out of the kindness of your heart? Maybe you'll do something for me, too. Really? What have you got in mind? Babe, we can see the world's going to shit. Might just take the two of us to continue the human species. You know, you're kind of ugly. I think I can make a better looking baby with someone else. I'm all for saving humanity, but you look like joiner shit already. Now, I was nice to you. Sure. Get the fuck out of here, little boy. Jackpot! - Impressive. - Who the hell are you? Come with me and I'll tell you. You know they teach little kids not to run off with strangers when they're three years old, right? Want to sit around here, counting your beans? Or you want to come save the world? I'm interested, and don't get too close, or I'll punch you in the face. Well then, let's begin. Your attack is crude and slow, like that of a clumsy... What do you want? I want you, child of Valeria, descendant of Nike. Jesus, another med junkie. Leave me alone! Wait! Leave me alone, junkie. Go get your next fix and quit bugging me. I am no junkie. I am a Guardian. You've got a screw loose. In case you didn't notice, the whole world has got a screw loose. They've succumbed to a virus, a plague. I suppose you'll say this is Biblical? Not at all. This is completely ungodly. Wait! Hear me out. - You've got two minutes. - I only need one. Where are we going? Keep up. We need to find shelter. Darkness is falling. You like coffee? Chaos, the self-proclaimed god, is slowly gaining more power as he turns more souls and ingests the essence of more of goddess Nike's bloodline. You are one of only a few who remain. I'm no descendant of a goddess. My mother was an office administrator before the great plague. Your family adopted you. They knew nothing of your true background. That's not true. Search inside yourself, Nicole. You know this to be true. You always felt different. You have a strength you can't control, visions you can't comprehend. I've been searching for you for 20 years. I knew your mother, your birth mother. What happened to her? The descendants of Nike all have their gifts, but one line of the blood from the seed of Zeus himself holds most power. Within you is the power of god and goddess, enough to save the world. If Chaos kills you and bathes in your blood, it will bring about eternal darkness. The world will succumb to the plague. The planet will slowly die. Okay, so don't let him kill me. I got you. But what happened to my mother? Your mother knew of her gifts, knew what she needed to do, but she was still a mother. It came down to her life or yours. As Chaos destroyed her, I escaped with you, took you to an orphanage. I have been tracking your moves ever since, and finally, we meet. Why didn't you help her? I have an obligation to my own bloodline. For centuries, we have sought the bloodline, to train them to face Chaos. We have come to the final impasse. The line is almost ended. So what do we do now? We save humanity or witness its end. - I'm not ready. - It's okay. I'm here to train you. But first, you must meet your cousins. This is strange. Joiners tend to stay within the confines of the city. Probably widening their search for food. There aren't too many people left to infect and feast on in the city. It looks hungry. I'll see if it wants some iron in its diet. Always be aware of your surroundings. Ensure a head or a heart shot. These things are getting tougher. We have much to do to get you ready. Nicole! You have a boyfriend? No, he's not my boyfriend. Good. You can do better, no offense. This is Roderick Sanchez Villalobos. Call me Rhodri. I'm Bijork, Nicole's mother. Mama? Sit down. We need to talk. Father. Amazing how quickly the blood goes. It's been mere days since we killed the evil witches. But now, one bowl of crimson remains. I want more! Every last drop of that cursed bloodline! You may get your wish, Father. We have tracked Villalobos and his new recruits. That makes two that we know of then. Including the bitch that escaped us. Yes. Keep our spies upon them. I want to know where they are housed and how many of the witches he has with him. Then we will end it. It will be done, Father. In the meantime, scour London. Scrape it clean. I want more minions. What is going on? Tail them. We are going on a hunt. - For the Nike women? - Not yet. For rogue troglodytes. - No fun. - Consider it your training. The world is within my grasp. Why did you never tell me? We were going to tell you. We thought maybe we'd help you find your birth parents. But the plague happened. Everything fell apart. We didn't see the point in upsetting you, and to be honest, I never expected us to survive this long. You know I love you unconditionally, as if you were mine. I always have. Henry, too. I know. You're both my parents, even if our blood says differently. I always knew you were special. Now I know why. I don't feel special. I told you you were special. You are the one, but we have little time. We need to begin training. It won't be long before we must face Chaos. Either we find him or he finds us, but battle is near. - Submit. - Bite me! I'll break it. Let her go. Alina, let go of her arm. No! Lindsay, just submit. We don't have time to fool around. You can't win this one. Just submit and I'll let you go. I submit. I submit! Very mature. What is this? She thought she was something special, and I thought I'd teach her she isn't. All I've learned is that you're a dickhead. Enough, Lindsay. Go to your room. Now! My sisters were far better than her, and they both fell to Chaos. You need to bring me better, Rhodri, if you want to save the world. Another little princess, I see. This is Nicole. Whatever. She won't last the week. You don't look so tough. Oh, sweetie, don't even try me. I'm really not in the mood. I was kind to Lindsay. I won't give you the chance to submit. I'll just snap your arm like a wishbone. We'll see. Enough, ladies! There is work here to be done. In case you have forgotten, we have an apocalypse to stop. You're cute when you get angry. Women. Come on, Nancy. I'll show you the way. - It's Nicole! - Whatever. I know this is tough and so soon after Crystal and Dominique were lost to you. But I can't give you time to grieve. We don't have that luxury. You just need to accept these new girls and move on, if not for yourself, but for humanity and your sisters. Don't let their deaths be in vain. I can't get close, Rhodri. I'm not ready to lose anyone else. I'm not asking you to be best buddies. I'm asking you to work together. It is the only way. Fine. I'm a professional. You better be right about these girls. Time will tell. I apologize to you both for my behavior. Forget it. Good. Now that we have settled our differences, we can get to work. But first, I have something for you. No way. Ladies, the fight for your life begins here and now. Training, let's go. Harder! Keep centered. You're off balance when you strike with your right. Try and stay a little more centered. Thanks, Alina. Are you sure they're ready? It's now or never, Alina. Are you ready? I need to see you working together in unison. It's the only way. Fuck! We've got no weapons! Oy! Fuckhead! - What is it? - It's an old radio. Report! What is their current location? Report! Your master Chaos demands confirmation. How many bloodline remain? Confirm location. Confirm last known location. 10 clicks northwest of the city. Is this still correct? Hey, shit stick! Never mind where we are. 10 clicks northwest of the city. - Who is this? - Ask my sisters, you prick. - 10 clicks? - 10 clicks? What do you mean? - You! - Yeah, it's me. We've got unfinished business. I know. About nine pints of blood. Join us and lose it before we take it from you. Your new friends are invited to donate too. - What's going on? - It's Chaos. One of the minions were calling him over the radio. Those were no minions. I do not doubt it is Erebus and Nyx, the sons of Chaos. Where's Nicole? - She was just here. - I didn't see where she went. She kept going on about 10 clicks. It's what Erebus said. The last confirmed location they had of us as 10 clicks, northwest of the city. Tool up! Tool up now! Mom? Mom? No. Oh my God. I know that sound. There's no greater sound than heartbreak. Let me go in alone. What if there's more joiners? Then I will deal with the sock head. I fear we are already too late. This is the aftermath. Nicole! You are the one. It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. - How are you feeling? - Exhausted. Broken. I know the feeling. Why so quiet, Rhodri? I've never seen you like this. Just taking a moment, the calm before the storm. The end is soon. It's funny. One way or another, I don't see beyond tomorrow. I've spent so much of my life being a phalanx knight. I never got to raise a family of my own. We're your family now, Rhodri. - Even if you're victorious? - Of course. You've taken us all on like three annoying nieces. Very annoying. I've spent my life running from pillar to post. I spent most of the plague era constantly running. I've never been close to anyone, but now I feel like I finally belong. Those girls might be a pain in the ass, especially Alina, but we're going into battle together. They're my sisters now. Pain in the ass am I? Nicole? I feel odd after yesterday. I had visions. I've had them before. And the power. I've felt a power within me, but I felt it come out yesterday for the first time. I told you you were special. You are the one. I'm working on an old Sanskrit, but I'm gonna need some of your blood. What? Not much, just about a pint, but I'm gonna need it now. - To give you time to recover. - Fine. I feel it in my bones, battle is near. You think we can defeat Chaos? If this works, yes. But it won't be easy where Chaos can be destroyed. If your sisters fail to defeat Erebus and Nyx, hope will be lost, and we still have the joiners to deal with. Oh, we have a lot to do - to harness your power. - Whatever it takes. Good. First things first. It stings. Worse. How are you holding up? Nothing's sunk in yet. Trying to come to terms with everything. Suddenly I'm feeling the weight of the world. I can't grieve for my parents yet. You'll get your moment. We'll all get our chance for justice. We need to make this right, so the people we lost haven't died in vain. What the hell is that? A potent mixture of chemicals, blood, and remnants of the Chaos realm. Bright green? Try injecting something bright green into yourself and see how you feel. This should destroy Chaos. How? Think of it like a junkie needing a fix but massively overdosing. One element alone will not harm him, but combined in concentrated doses should destroy him. The chromosomes in your blood is the key. You will need to inject this into Chaos's bloodstream. How? Through the back of the neck. It's the only way. Well, there is one other way. What? Believe me, you don't wanna know. Go for the neck. - Okay. What's up? I want you to help me. Help me harness and control my power. Okay. I'm confused. What are we doing? - Knock me over. - What? From 20 feet away. You want me to knock you over from 20 feet away? So how the hell do I knock you over? Focus on me. Now close your eyes. Picture your target. Feel your energy grow. Your Nike blood, do not fear it. Embrace it. Control it! Send its energy to your hands. Now strike! Shit, Rhodri! Jesus. Rhodri, are you okay? Again! No! Delicious. Enough games. Ready yourselves. Go to the city, await the enemy, and lead them here. Judgment day has arrived. Ah. - Yes. - Finally, brother. - The world is ours. - No! Mine! So how do we feel, ladies? We feel like saving the world, Uncle Roddy. Let's do this. Uncle Roddy? Please don't call me Uncle Roddy. Uncle Rods, what will happen to the joiners and the earth when Chaos dies? Will the crops grow again? The truth is I don't know. The prophecies say so, but they are centuries old, maybe more. It's just I'm getting tired of eating Spam. It can't be good for my guts, Uncle Rods. Come on! Will you be watching over? No, I will be right by your side. If we fail, there will be no more chances. You girls, if Chaos succeeds in becoming a god, not even goddess Nike could stop him. It's too quiet. Something doesn't feel right. Um... What's the plan, guys? We need to conserve our energy for the final battle. More joiners will descend here soon. Yeah, definitely. Run! Shit! We got cornered. What did we do? We're trapped. Stand and fight. Get in! Now! Come on! Now! - Come on! - Come on! What on earth are you lot doing out in the open at this time? We are here to stop Chaos. Chaos? No, no one can stop him. I've heard nonsense of bloodlines. Unless you've found yourself descendants of a goddess, then I suggest you steer well clear of these dark forces. Yeah. What is it? Have I got something in my teeth? These ladies are descendants of goddess Nike and humanity's last hope of salvation. Oh, right. Hi, I'm Gavin. I'm a pub landlord. Oh my hero, Gavin. I'm dying for a pint. I'll get you some refreshments, shall I? We have to stay down here. We can't go upstairs into the pub until nighttime. I'll introduce you to me wife. Three goddesses in my basement. How will I explain this to the missus? - Something's not right. - I agree. He's a little odd. Not him, the joiners. Their numbers are larger than before. Chaos must have combed the city for survivors and turned them. Then we'll fight our way through more, but we fight. We need more than this. We can help. You? No offense. Oh, well, not just us two. We're part of a wider group of survivors. We searched for fellow survivors, opening up lines of communication, helping each other with supply runs. It's been a slow process, yeah? So we have an army? - Not quite, no. - How many are there? Just us two and our friend John. He'll fight. What is it? Rhodri, what the hell is it? It is the war horn of Abraxas. The what? Chaos is calling us out. We must follow the horn. The final battle awaits. Well, sorry, Chaos, old buddy, but we've got ravenous joiners to get through first. I'll gather the others. Let us help. We can help! If this is to be the final stand, then we will give our lives to stop Chaos. If we sit by, there'd be no world left anyway. Either way, we're gonna die. We might as well fight. I have a plan. I will join the survivors. Lead the charge, clear the path to the Chaos lair. What is it, Alina? It's a suicide mission. It is the only way. Alina, our mission isn't exactly a picnic. We haven't got time for debating. We're ready. This is Night Hawk, over. This is John, over. - Code names, over. - Robin, over. Hi, John, it's Kathy. You guys good to go? Yes, Kathy. Great. We're coming out now. - We'll storm them. - See you there. Good luck. God speed. Sorry, darling. No time for formalities. Forget it. We're about to go to war. Nicole? You remember what I told you? You have the vials ready? Yes. I got this, two spares. You only have three shots at this. Make them count. Ladies. It's been my honor to watch over you. Time to kick ass. Just make sure you're back at the house for dinner tonight. Ladies, give us five minutes to clear the streets. - And goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Let's tool up and head for the city edge, girls. We might have time for a little nip of this, girls. - Really? You sure? - Oh, come on. It might be your last chance, Nicole. I love you guys. You're like family to me. All I have left. Woo! All right, let's not go in pissed, ladies. I was gagging for that. Let's do this. Let's go save the world. Interesting. What's going on? They took the bait. A group of rebels have found their way in. And what of the Nike whores? No news yet, but it looks to me like they're sacrificing themselves to clear a path. Brave cattle. They'll get an even bigger surprise when they find our new breed of joiner. We've made it, girls. Let's make sure this counts. I wonder what happened to the others. We'll take care of these two. You go inside and you find Chaos. Let's do this. - God, these joiners are tough. - Tell me about it. All alone? I'm impressed. This is the end, Chaos. How true, descendant of Nike. Seems we have a new breed of joiner here, tougher to kill but twice the fun. No! No! You have power, but you're no match for me, girl. As your friends fall and I bring about an end to your wretched bloodline, know this, wench. As the world fades to black and everything the gods held dear dies as my minions flourish. And as you die, so will I be reborn. This is reign of Chaos! Goddess power, bitch. Did we, did we win? We won. Hey. I got food. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Just thinking about Alina and Rhodri. Me too. Picked some flowers. We can visit their graves. Did you sleep okay? More nightmares? They're just nightmares. What is it?
