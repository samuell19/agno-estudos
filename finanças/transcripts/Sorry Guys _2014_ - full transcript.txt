Fact: you're together he wants to be here? Okay 2nd fact: he didn't know about us So in fact he doesn't know anything Svenja Oh no What? I thought we could all tell him together It's beer o'clock "Hey Ulf! later Svenja and Robert are gonna make a baby!" If you say it like that anything sounds crap Got one for me? Let's all calm down You tell him and then we'll see It doesn't have to be this month Yes, it does! I'll be on a cruise ship... ...as an entertaineress As an entertainer? That's what I said What ship? When? In May baby has to be out by then your call either we do it today or we leave it And if it doesn't work the first time? We'd like to have a baby the two of us Robert and I would like to have a baby For a long time And it's not that easy for us as we are gay as we are two men and that's why, basically, physically, why we can't have one. and that's why I'll do it We don't mean through sexual intercourse. The whole thing is done with it happens via self-impregnation. Self-impregnation You fancy her? She's your sister I don't mean that She's different From me? From the usual Her English foul I can already picture my mum she'd hate that What about your mum? We'll probably bump into her at some point Well, I still haven't met your mother You'll be having a baby so it will be yours I just don't get it As surrogate mother Jesus, what's so difficult to understand? Tell'em to get a dog! Seriously, enough is enough Enough? You've got a daughter You're married and together with me What does that have to do with this? Louis wants to be happy Just like you Because it sucks not having a family and that's why he needs me now But we can also be happy Just quit the job at the club! We'll get our own place a fresh start together Do you think that'll work? A pregnancy will change you you'll wanna keep it in the end It won't work anyways We can still ask somebody else Why do you say that? Stop running her down Why are you defending her all the time? This is about me too She's carrying it, it's about her and then it's about the child They will bond regardless if she's raising it We agreed! Yes we did Are you being paid? No They bought you that's why you're doing this I said I didn't want money But I won't be working. What can I do? How much? Robert's parents have oil paintings of each member of the family in golden frames understand? Just marry the queer! Know what you are? Homophobic! Forget the cock suckers, this is about us! I'm entitled to my opinion! And what IS your opinion? What the fuck am I doing here? You're a part of it! a part of me So how will this actually work?
