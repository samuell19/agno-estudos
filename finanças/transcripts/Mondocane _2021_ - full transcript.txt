IN THE FAVELA SPRUNG UP IN THE SHADOW OF THE STEEL MILL, THE FORSAKEN SURVIVE BEYOND THE LAW IN THE CITY THAT HAS BECOME THE SYMBOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RUIN. I told you it was here. Beautiful, isn't it? But is it worth anything? I don't know, but it must be worth something. - What is it? - I don't know, does it matter? It was worth it, huh? Yeah. - What's up with you? - Nothing. - I have to tell you something. - What? - They offered me a job. - A job, who? The Ants. - When were you gonna tell me? - I'm telling you now. - When? - Now. When did you talk to them? We are together all the time. What do you care? Do you want to know or not? Yes, tell me everything. We need to set fire to a store. - That's all? - Yeah. That is so fucking lucky. But I have to tell you something... there's a problem. Can you hear me? Sooner or later this is gonna kill me. Nothing'll happen to you. Come on, get up. Get rid of that thing. It's too heavy. What were you saying? There's a problem... Nah, nothing. Come on, let's go. OFF-LIMITS AREA CONTAMINATED - BIOHAZARD NO ENTRY Where were you, you bastards? Mind your own fucking business! You dirty sons of bitches. Hurry up! It's fucking late. Pull those mussels up. Calm down, Lightning, you're gonna have a heart attack. Eat shit. Yeah, right, laughing like a pair of idiots. Can't you see, the anchovies are coming in with the tide? And we're stuck here with this fucking wreck of a boat! I thought the anchovies came in winter. What the fuck do you know? You can't even tell if seawater's salty. Shut up! It'd be best if you stick to cooking. Holy shit! - Stay down. - Fuck! OFF-LIMITS AREA Stop, they're gone. Where the fuck are they? Let's go back. Wait, let me see. - Who's that, Hothead? - No, it's not him. What the fuck's he doing? What the fuck are you looking at? Fuck off, you're useless! You saw it, we were almost there. This is the last time I cover for you. Let's go. - Wait. - He's sleeping. What are you stealing, you bastards? - Nothing, nothing. - Nothing, yeah? What have you got there? OK, come on, a bit of gas. - A bit of gas? - Just a little. - We need it. - To do what? OK, come on, don't break our balls! - Go back to sleep! - I'll break your legs. DOGWORLD - Look, you go and talk to him. - No, you go. You're better at talking. What the fuck do I care? I'm not going. Tell him we'll pay for the gas sooner or later, anything, so long as we get out of here. Yeah, and what'll I say? What the fuck do I know? That tomorrow we... - Yeah, "tomorrow we..." - Hey, shitheads! You're not getting out of there if you don't cough up the money first. Again? We don't have it! So what did you do with my gas? We've told you a thousand times, we can't say. - Why not? - We just can't. No? You're not leaving, then. Go fuck yourself. Sons of bitches. Well done. What the fuck! You wanna tell him the truth? Don't you see? He won't let us go unless we pay him back. Yeah, OK, but first we gotta come up with the money. You talk to him, tell him that if he doesn't let us out of here this money... we'll make it here! - Do you work here? - Yes. She gives me a hand every now and then. The fire was arson. Did you notice anything strange these last few days? Nothing, all normal. What's in the backshop storage? The usual things. Tools, feed, stuff like that. This isn't feed. You need to come with us. - I don't know anything about this. - Move. - I mean it. - Move! I don't have anything to do with this. What's going on? Would you like to have a few words with me? Why? Maybe you can help me understand who caused this mess. Only a few words, it won't take long, I promise. Then I'll take you back to school. No, I'm at the orphanage, quadrant 24. - What the fuck are you doing? - Just a moment. - You never do shit! - We're always fixing things. Sure, you do! You've turned this boat into a piece of shit. Dogworld? - It's Quickgun. - Dogworld! Dogworld, how long are you taking? Stupid old goat, let me go! - My name's Pietro. - It was. Now your name's Dogworld. You really did well, you know that? You started the fire, didn't you? Yes, with him. Who, him? We know him. Hothead wants to see you, just you. Not Pisspants. Get on, let's go... Get on. Pietro! You fucking pain in the ass. Wait for me! Screw you. Do you recognize anyone? Let's try these. I don't know, I'm not sure. Alright, don't worry. - Do you already know who did it? - We have our suspicions. The Ants. You know who they are, don't you? Yes, everyone knows who they are. - Why did they hurt the animals? - That's what we want to figure out. But there weren't only animals in there. Somebody was making drugs in there. And Hothead had someone set it on fire. Who's Hothead? The leader. The leader? And you're looking for him. It's late, come on. You've been away for more than two hours, I'll have you taken back. Can't you take me back? ONCOLOGICAL HOSPITAL - CITTADELLA Hothead? Come here. Come, come. Quickgun says you're sharp. Do you wanna stay here with us? You know there's no going back? - Good. What else can you do? - A little bit of everything. - Can you ride a motorbike? - No. - Shoot? - No. You can't do shit. But I can stay underwater for two-and-a-half minutes. And I can dive to 20 meters. 20 meters... You can't do shit, but you're sharp. And nobody knows him, in New Taranto. Well, that's something. Good. But I wasn't alone last night, he was there too. - Cristian. - Who, Pisspants? - Who's that? - The sick one. I'm not joining. Not without him. I'm sorry, but I don't need Pisspants. He didn't piss his pants last night. And he's good, better than me. If anything happens, I'll take care of it. Listen, forget about him. It's either both of us or nothing. Really? Nothing, then. Bye, Dogworld. Come on! Go! - Well? - They took me on. - And me? - No. You can stay here and wipe the old man's ass. - Nice, huh? - Who the fuck do you think you are? Where are you going without me, you piece of shit? What can you do? That's life. Now you're fucking with me. Come on, tell me how it really went. I said no. - Are you crazy? - They didn't want you. So I told them, both of us or nothing. Then you were right to tell them to fuck off. I dunno. When will I ever get a chance like that again? You'd leave me here with the old man? - What would you have done? - The same as you did. Can I believe that? You'd have left me here with him. Fuck off. You bastards! You were strays and you still are. I took you in off the street, you two were starving and now you're going with that gang of murderers. Lightning, we don't have to stay with you our whole lives. You're pissed that we've found something better? Or do you want a chance like that? Shut up, asshole. I think the old guy's jealous. No good will come out of you two! Think if we'd gone with the Ants... - what would happen to him? - They would take him to Tamburi. Or he'd have been found in the middle of the street. Maybe he'd have found two losers like us. That's the thing. It's not so much what we'll do with him, it's what you and me are gonna do now. You think there's any chance of speaking again with Quickgun? I don't think so. How'd you mean? Hi, I have to speak to the Prefect. I've brought the girl back. We'll tell him, park the car over there. Yes, I know where. Don't worry. I won't let him punish you, I'll talk to him. You grew up here as well, right? Your parents? Killed. And you? Never knew them. I only know they're in the cemetery in Tamburi. I don't know anything else. - Could you take me there? - To Tamburi? - No, I can't. - Why not? Can the police not do what they want? No, it's off-limits for us as well. Only the sterilization unit goes there. Thanks for bringing her back, Officer. She was with us. Just so you know. But she ran away this morning and not for the first time. Leave me alone! Have a good day. Damn, he's heavy. How the fuck are we gonna move him? - You think that's enough wood? - I dunno, I've never burned anybody. What the fuck are you doing? - I'm giving him the blessing. - Are you a jerk? You really want to have a funeral for this bastard? Don't you remember where this bastard dragged us out of? If it wasn't for him... If it wasn't for us, he'd have died ages ago. - He was like a father. - A what? - A father. - Fuck you, he always treated us like dogs. - He taught us everything. - He taught us how to give blowjobs! Have you forgotten? He taught us to swim and to fish. To fish his dick. Pietro, wake up. We were slaves. Go! On three. One... two... and...three. - Are we lost? - I'm sure they brought me here. The Ants have to be around here someplace, I'm sure of it. - Yeah, sure! - What do you wanna do, go back? - Aren't you gonna dump that thing? - No. Are you carrying it? I'm carrying it. What are we gonna do if we don't find the Ants? - We'll go to Africa. - Yeah, Africa, I've got no money. What do you care? We know what to do on board. Then we work our passage, right? Those guys will kill you first and then ask you what your name is. The Africans are bound to know we did the store job for the Ants. - Quickgun? - What are you doing? Calling him. You got a better idea? What the fuck is this? - And these guys? - Strays. - What do you want? - Take us with you. - Where? - To the Ants. Come on! Go! Where the fuck are we going? We're going round in circles. We told you, we don't know where the Anthill is. Nobody knows. Go! Let's get them all! Where the fuck are you running to? Come on, come here! Help! Leave me alone! Help! Help! Are you ready for sterilization? - Oh, God, what a place! - Total shit. It's going to be dark soon. So what do we do, wait here till morning? - I don't want to stay here. - We just gonna go on blindly? You're the only one who can help us. Look at them carefully. Wait. This one with the beard. I think I've seen him before. I've seen him more than once, I'm sure. In the store. - It's Cengis. - I'm going. - Easy with the orphan, eh? - Meaning? Meaning, taking her out of here. I'm not her mom. Anyway we have to be on her, I'm sure she saw something else. OK, I get it. What'll we do about Cengis? - Arrest him? - Not for now. Maybe he'll lead us to Hothead. Is this your favorite color? I like pink, yellow... We can only choose one. - Which one will we choose? - They're all beautiful. - Can we choose two? - One. - Why? - You have to learn to choose. What's your favorite? What do you want to do? - The giraffe. - Very good. We'll do it here with a long neck, eh? I don't understand you, Dogworld. You were already in... Don't you listen to us? We don't want him. He's sick. - We did the job together. - Oh, yeah? What did he do? We burnt the shop. What do you care if instead we are two? They brought you something. For me? Yes, we found it 20 meters down, off Contrada Rondinella. It's beautiful. Do you know what it is? No. Who knows here? What should I do with these two? What should we do? Let's throw them in the sea. It won't take long to find two strays better than these two. Fuck this dickhead! Piece of shit! Watch out. You really are an asshole. Wait, wait! Watch out, when Pisspants gets angry... Am I right? There is a little job you two can do. A simple thing. If you do it, you're in. If not, you fuck off back to wherever you came from. Let's go. Find me the safe. You two as well. Go and look, move. Come on, let's not waste time! Quick! Come on! So many new clothes. Look here. What should I wear? - Neither of them. - No. You put it on. It's nice. Bingo! Come here! - What are you doing? - It's hot. - What the fuck are you saying? - Try it. - And her? - I don't know. Maybe this is her house? And you want to keep her hidden, are you crazy? You weren't even meant to be here. Since we're here... Here's what's going to happen. You give me the combination for the safe, I save a lot of time and you get rid of a problem. - I don't know it... - Look at me, look at me. Look at me. - I don't know it. - No? My husband knows it. What are you keeping in that safe? Do you know now? Do you know it or not? - Yes or no? - No. - Shoot her. - No! - No, please! - Do you know it or not? Please don't hurt me, I beg you. She really doesn't know. Come here. Let's take this fucking safe away, come on. You got scared? Come here. Here, come on. Whitehouses? She saw your faces. Go. Beautiful! Welcome to the Anthill. Right... How things work here, you'll find out for yourselves. It's not difficult. The beds are there and so are your things. - What about clothes? - You keep those. We look like dorks! Your bag's there, we don't give you anything. Ants aren't allowed to have property. We give you only the helmets, the boots and that's it. Nothing else is needed. - And the guns? - And the motorcycles? Guns and motorcycles... calm down. You can also go out. But you have to be careful when you come back that no one follows you. Nobody knows where the Anthill is. Then there are places in New Taranto where you really can't go. And if you get caught, you mustn't talk. You have to keep your mouth shut. Or we'll shut it for you. What's in there? Nothing. We're all into animal rights here. Go on, you have a shot as well. The frog kiss... Come here... try it. Lick it. It'll bring you joy. Lick it, Dogworld. Come on. Lick. - It didn't do shit for me. - Me neither. Fuck, look at the way it fell! You ready? Watch Bomb-boy. Insert the clip. Pull the bold to load the round. Like he did. Now the rifle's ready. I mean it. Hold them tight. They recoil pretty hard. Go. Take aim. Breathe slowly. Easy, easy. What did I say? Lean forward or the recoil will knock you over. Go. Good job, Pisspants! Are you sleeping? - Are you jerking off? - What are you saying? - What is it? - Nothing. Hey, I can see it's a photo. Where did you get that? - At the villa. - Why? I just liked it. Sure you like it... Bloody hell! The women... Your mother! - Make some room for me. - Why? You know what we're gonna do with this money I stole? - We'll spend it all on that place. - Where? The one in the photo. You heard that we can't mix with the New Taranto people. - Why not? - It's dangerous. - How do you mean? - They might catch us. True. Too bad though, all those people loaded with money. And the girls from New Taranto... If you think about it, what the fuck could happen? Me and you, on the beach... I don't know, but it still is kinda dangerous. True. You know what I say? We'll go there anyway. Look at that ass. Yeah, so nice. Yeah... Good morning, guys, can I get you something? Yes, two glasses of water. No... two beers. - OK, two beers. Anything else? - Panzerotti... - Something else? Fries? - No. - Can I bring you the menu? - All right, bring everything. - Everything? - You know what to do, we're hungry. Go, you jerk, move. - I'm left with 20 lire! - Keep calm, it's on the house. Bastard. OK, come on. Let's get a move on. - Why? - It's getting late. - Put that away! - No. - Come on. - I'm putting it on. Take it off, come on. Why? Can't someone like me have this? Absolutely not! - Really? - Yeah. OK, I'll take it off. You think they'll be game? - Are you serious? - Sure, why? No. How much do you wanna bet? First time here? No, why? - Where are you from? - Where d'you think? Here. - New Taranto? - Yes, we're originals. Our parents have had a cabin here for years. - Do we know each other? - No. He and I are always together. I think I've seen you before. - Impossible. - Why? Well, he'd have remembered someone like you, no? And so would I. - Anyway, hi, I'm Cristian. - Sabrina, nice to meet you. You don't speak? Pietro. - Having fun with your class? - Big deal, physical education. Cute friends you got there... Tamburi? I won't get you chased away. Who do you think I am? Chased for what? Theft? Rather, thefts? - I have to go. See you again, yeah? - Sure, but when? - I'm here with school every day. - I'll see you here, then. Listen... I won't say you're here illegally and you take me to Tamburi, at the cemetery. That's all? What's the problem? I've definitely seen you before. - You see how she looked at me? - How? She wants me. Yeah, but she wants me more. By the way, what's this thing about having met before? - I saw her at the pet store. - Why, had you been there before? To see what the place was like, I saw her there, feeding the animals. - Did you go without me? - What was I supposed to do? - Quickgun took me there. - Why didn't you tell me? What was I supposed to tell you? That they didn't want you? Cheers! You're so pretty, are you? You are so pretty. You're a beautiful big puppy. And you, don't you ever play with him? Of course I play with him. I give him lots of cuddles. That's because he can't speak, otherwise he'd tell you. I was told that bracelet of yours lights up regularly. You have a bit of a habit of running away. You brought me here to lecture me? No, but if you keep getting noticed, you'll spend your whole life at the steel mill. If you want something better for yourself, you have to behave. To do what, become a cop? A policewoman... or anything else. It'll always be better than the steel mill, won't it? Don't you want a house and a job, here in New Taranto? See? You're lecturing me. The orphanage was an opportunity for me. Sorry, I don't really think what I said earlier. What, that I'm a loser? It's nice to see you smile. - What d'you mean? - Did something happen? Nothing special. But... But? Yesterday at the beach, I met some boys. Here we go. Cute? Nice... funny, strays. I also think I've seen one of them before, somewhere around New Taranto. Where? Maybe I'm wrong, in fact, I'm sure I'm wrong. - Perfect. - Is it what you wanted? Thanks. Hothead, I chose these. Wait. Let's play a game first. So, here it is. Good morning, please, introduce yourself. Touch it. Hi, how are you? Dodger? Do you have something to tell me? No? Sure? Listen, this thing can read your thoughts. Are you ready? There it goes! That's enough! Stop! Please, I'll return everything. I don't understand. I'll return everything. Now put the money back. All right? The girls are hot in New Taranto. - I like the one from the beach. - Who? - Sabrina. - You really like her? I just don't understand you. With all the girls at the Anthill, you have to like her? - When do we do Cengis? - Whenever you want, Hothead. We know where he is, we know all his movements. - You choose these? - That's them. I want you to be careful, because it's not an easy thing. Pisspants and Dogworld? For a mission like this? No, Hothead, they're not ready. Let's bring them. - They've just got here. - Let's bring them anyway, I said. I want to see how they do. Cristian, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. - What happened? - Nothing. - Did anyone see me? - What do you care? Are you OK now? Yes, I'm fine. - Are you sure you're OK? - I told you I'm fine. Hey, don't get pissed off, now. It's Cengis. He came to ask the Africans for protection. If Hothead finds out it's gonna be war. - Maybe they'll all kill each other. - You wish! We'll take them. Me and you, on our own? Either you get authorized this time, or I'm not with you. I'm sorry. Get out of here, Katia. No, you stay here. What the fuck are we gonna do here? We gotta look after the bikes. Fuck this. This sucks. Where are you going, Cristian? - They told us to stay here. - You stay there. Where are you going? You can't see anything from there. I don't want to miss this. What is happening? I don't know, a big mess. He's here. What the hell are we doing here? Fuck it, I'm going back to the bikes. They already love you. What happened with Cengis? We shot that son of a bitch. "We"? You and him? Yes, why? Because Dogworld didn't shoot. He was nearer, - but I shot first. - And Dogworld? His gun must have jammed. You care for your friend. Are you alright? Do they treat you well here? - Yes. - Yes! If you have any problem, anything, you can come to me. Because friendship is a beautiful thing... but this is your family now. I know. Be careful with your friend. He'll bring you down. Go and celebrate, go on. Cristian, are you coming for a swim? Come on, Cristian, come for a swim. - What's wrong with you? - Let's go, come on. Are you kidding? After everything we did to get here... I don't even know what the fuck we're doing here. Stop being a jerk, she wants us to take her to Tamburi. Come on. To Tamburi? She's into you. I'm even working her up for you... I don't give a shit. - Have you become a faggot? - What are you saying? We weren't meant to be here. We're Ants or have you forgotten? Keep your voice down. I'm leaving, you do what you like. Hey tell us where it is. Near the hospital in Cittadella? At The Cross? Or in the Statte Neighborhood? Where is it? We've already been to Paolo VI. And we'll go back! You can't hide. What do you think you're doing? You're never getting out of here... We can stay here a year! Help us, Bombboy. Where's the Anthill? We know it's somewhere between Paolo VI and Tamburi. You've been lucky with us because where I am taking you now, everyone talks. All you have to do is point to it on the map. Ok, that's enough. Let's transfer him. They'll move him and beat him senseless, you have to bring him back to me before they make him talk. - Where are they taking him? - How the fuck do I know? Find him. - What's up? - They arrested Bombboy. - Where? - New Taranto. - What's this all about? - They caught him at the beach. - And what was he doing there? - What do you think he was doing? He was on a mission, unlike you, going for a swim. - Fuck, they were looking for us. - No, for you! What do you want? You were there with me. Don't piss me off, I left earlier. - You were falling for her. - What the fuck do you want? Can't you see she's coming between us? - Between you and me? - Between us and the Ants. Talk to the kids, go. Right... Bomb-boy's been caught. Now we need to see where they transfer him, so we can go and free him. Let me past! Move, move! Keep calm... Cristian, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. It's nothing. Don't worry. Did you see what Dogworld did? Let him teach you, because if this happens again I want you ready. - Yes or no? - Yes. Good. We were waiting for you. I'm here. You're back. What is this place? Home. I was born here. Hello. These are my people, come. - What do they do? - They're fishermen. Like you. Hey, Salvatore! - How are you? - Fine. Is there something to eat for this kid? - Sure. - Good. Hey, some food for the boy. Let's go. It's a lot. God bless you, Salvatore. Eat, come on. They're very good. I was a kid when the Big Evacuation took place. In one week they kicked the people out and shut down Taranto. The steel mill was killing people. The steel couldn't be touched... but the people, yes. - Why are they still here? - Contamination doesn't scare them. They think their land shouldn't be abandoned, because it's the most important thing they have. You grew up in Tamburi because you had no choice. But they have ideals, they want reclamation, they want to rebuild as it was before. Indeed, better than it was before. That's what the money we steal is for. To get back what they took away from us. When I was in the orphanage, I tried in every way to be different from the others. Curiosity saved me. Reading and studying... trying to create in my mind the image of what I wanted to build. And now I have you all, the Ants... We will wage war. Then we'll have to put things back in their place. You're with me now, but you'll have to be here after as well. Because you're like me. We don't like fate. Because fate is the opposite of freedom. I don't even know what they are like. Your friend's really cute. You think? So he's cute now? He's normal, like lots of other guys. But let me tell you, he has a shitty personality. With all that you steal, can't you spare a few bucks to go to Africa? I wish... Where would you like to go? I don't know, anywhere as long as it's far from here, like Rome. To do what? Visit it. It used to be the capital. Exactly, used to be. It seems to me there's nothing left to do there. And what do you know? - People say. - People say, who? Come on, help me. - What if they're still alive? - They might be, sure. I think it's best if we go. - Why? - It's been flashing for a while, what if they catch you here? Hard labor. Anyway, they've already caught me. And us? When will we see each other again? It depends on how long my punishment is. Four or five days. It also depends on how pissed off they are. So we'll meet again on the sixth? At the beach? Pisspants, go and see. Come out, you sons of bitches. Let's go, guys. That bitch... From now on Pisspants is in charge. - Why? - I'm doing it for you. Otherwise I'd have to kill you for this fuck-up of yours. Right... Bombboy will be missed by everyone. But he only did what he swore to do when he became an Ant. - What's wrong? - Leave me alone. What you all swore you would do. - Tell me what the fuck's wrong! - Leave me alone. If something's wrong, tell me. You still don't get it? Beat it! There he is. You think you can do whatever the fuck you like? Do you think you're free? He was with me as well. Come here. Take him to the well. Come on. I don't know what the fuck to do with Dogworld. First you have to see if he survives. Do you want him dead? For me, he's better dead than alive. He broke a rule, he didn't betray us. Let's leave him in the well another week and then we'll see. Even after a month he won't grow a pair. Whatever, with Cengis he shat himself. What would you do? - I'd leave him... - Not you. Me? We can punish him again, but if he's got no balls, what will we achieve? So? So, he has to prove to us that he wants to be an Ant. Good. Go and tell him. What do you want? Here. Easy. - Get me out of here. - Yeah, soon. God, you're ugly. You're really messed-up. And you're handsome! Please, let me out. That's why I'm here. Are we going back? - Where to? - To the fishing boat. Yeah. You think it's still there? Sure, Pietro, who's gonna take that old wreck? - Look, there is a way to get out. - How? Hothead doesn't trust you anymore. You have to show him you're cool. What do I have to do? There's this policewoman... The one who caught Bombboy. And? You have to kill her. It's the only way to save yourself. What the fuck are you saying? - Let's run away, let's go to Africa. - Where the fuck d'you wanna go? You still don't get how things work here? We've dreamt of this life since we were kids. Cos we didn't know what it was like. What the fuck did you want to know? That once in, you can't get out? That nobody leaves the Ants? That Hothead... I don't wanna hear about fucking Hothead anymore! - Pietro, what's with you? - What's happened to you? Maybe you still don't get it... either you do it or they'll kill you. Go. Go, go, go! Leave me alone, leave me alone. Look. Can someone explain to me why this kid is still alive? We'll get him. Leave it. The current goes this way. Two teams are already looking for him. In Chernobyl and in No-Man's Land. We'll find him, we'll look for him till we find him. He's gone to Tamburi. What are you saying? That's the stupidest place to hide. Precisely. Precisely. Let's go to Tamburi. Now we'll find him. And then you and I will take care of this. And I promise I'll let you kill him with your own hands. Find me that kid. Find him! Sabrina, I'm sorry. What were you doing there? - You're an Ant, you're a killer! - No. If I hadn't been in the car with her, what would you have done? Answer me! I don't want to see you anymore. Wait. Tonight when the wind drops, go back to the city. And swim for a bit. You're a good swimmer, you can do it. And you? I'm already dead, you save yourself. Pietro? Wait. I'm coming with you. No, you have to go on your own. I'm coming with you, I said. You really wanna leave me here alone? You understand that if they find me, they'll kill you as well? It's just a matter of time, but they will find me. You have to go. Where? To the orphanage? There's no one there for me. I'm not going back. Where are they? Where are they? Tell me! They're looking for us in Tamburi. Let's go to the steel-mill port. The freighters for the north are leaving tonight. So? Do they know or not? They don't know shit. Where are we going? They're not here. What the fuck did you bring us here for, Pisspants? Your friend's fooled you again. You know why? Because he's better than you. Shut up. He came this way, he went out to sea. - Where is he? - At the steel-mill port. Get up here with me. There it is! But it's on the other side! Go! Go! Go! What now? - What'll we do? - Get on there. - What about you? - Trust me. I want him alive! I made you a promise. Let's go, let's go. What'll you do now? Shoot me? Oh, Cri... Look at me. Take that thing off. Look at me. It's me... Pietro. Come on, let's go. Fuck the Ants. Come on, let's go. There's no going back. He's here! - Come on, go! - Over here! I'm here. I'm here.
