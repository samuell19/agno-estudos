I'm looking for a truffle pig. I don't... I, uh, I don't understand. I just wanna know about the pig. Tell him who you are. Come on. Tell him. Chef Feld? Oh, my God. Uh, may I? Uh, how are you? My God, you... you've been off the scene for what, uh, ten years? AMIR: 15. Really? OK. I thought you were, um, well, I mean... - Time is very, uh... - Sure. Yeah. I'm sorry, do you need medical attention? No, thank you. Uh, you probably don't remember me but I actually worked at Hestia.

But I'm running a business here and people have expectations uh, critics, investors... so forth, and, uh... truffles are... are... are a key part of the whole, uh, concept of the winter menu and they need to be the top of the line. So, you understand. I-I have... I have the utmost respect for you, utmost. INDISTINCT CHATTER What is the... "concept" here? Um, well, uh... we're interested in taking local ingredients uh, native to this region and... and just deconstructing them you know, making the... the familiar feel foreign. Thereby giving us, uh... an even greater appreciation of food as a whole. This is the kind of cooking you like? It's cutting-edge, it's very exciting. Exciting? Uh, I mean, everybody loves it. You like cooking it? Absolutely. Derek... what was it you always used to talk about opening? Wasn't it a pub? Every... everyone loves it here. It's a... this is a huge success. ROBIN: Why didn't you open your pub? HE STAMMERS I don't know that I really wanted, uh, I mean... it's such... that was such a long time ago. When I fired you, I asked you what you wanted to do. You said you'd have a few rooms upstairs a real English pub. - D-Did I say that? - Yes. Nobody wants pubs around here. It's... It's... It's a terrible investment. ROBIN: What was going to be your signature dish? Liver scotch eggs with a honey curry mustard. HE LAUGHS They're not real. You get that, right? None of it is real. The critics aren't real... the customers aren't real... because this isn't real. You aren't real. What? HE LAUGHS OK. Derek, why do you care about these people? They don't care about you, none of them. They don't even know you because you haven't shown them. Every day, you wake up and there'll be less of you. You live your life for them and they don't even see you. You don't even see yourself. We don't get a lot of things to really care about. HE GULPS Derek... who has my pig?
