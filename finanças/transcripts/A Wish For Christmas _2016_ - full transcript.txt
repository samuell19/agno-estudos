I-- Sir, could you just-- Could you just please hold the elevator? Could you-- Sorry. [sighs] Oh! Sara! Hey! Hey, Molly. Thanks so much for waiting. There you go. Oh! You're a saint. Hey, were you able to do a quick pass on the Miller account? Uh, I'm so sorry, Molly. I'm-- I've just been so busy. Just a quick punch-up? Sure. Yeah, you know what, I-- I can do it after lunch. Thank you so much. Sure. Frankly, the way things are going, Christmas is turning into one big, giant headache. I know. Christmas isn't all it's cracked up to be. I've tried to make it work. If you don't like it, then maybe you should talk to him. [elevator dings] I have to go. Mm-hmm. Yes. Oh! Christmas is not happening. I'm sorry. Uh, ahem, did I hear that correct, boss? Because I got five employees coming in to work on Christmas, but if it's not happening... What? No, no. That's not what I meant. No. It's happening. Ah. [gasps] Oh! Best co-worker ever. You're welcome, Bryan. So, are you gonna be at the party tonight, boss? Yeah, yeah. It's my company's party. [chuckles] Of course. I mean-- No question there. -What's that? -Uh... [stammering] It's a "Secret Santa" gift. For the party tonight, which... I can't wait for. I mean... I just love Christmas. Especially Christmas parties, you know. Just... so... so fun. Okay. That's great. All right, I'll see you both there. [♪♪♪] Get rid of it. Oh, come on, boss! A little mistletoe never hurt anybody. [sighing] I cannot believe I just rambled on like that in front of him. You don't say. "'Secret Santa' present for the party. "Which I can't wait for. Very excited. Yup, I love Christmas." You know how nervous I get. Ugh. I mean, especially around him. I think I've said five words to the guy the whole entire time I've worked here. He is so cute. Molly! What? I can't call our boss handsome? It's too bad he's so uptight. I mean, you heard what he said to Bryan. He's making Bryan's team work on Christmas again. Second year in a row. That's just awful. Oh! So the Miller thing? Any chance you could get to it sooner? Uh, tell me again why I'm working on your project? Because I respect your opinion. Think of it as a compliment. I'll get to it this afternoon. I just have to finish my stuff first. But I promise. This morning would be better. By, like, a lot. Okay. No problem. Great! Sara. My office! Now! Fingers officially crossed. Thanks. Ahem. Okay. Where's my Wilson Taylor file? My meeting's in an hour. Where is my layout? Oh, I emailed it to you yesterday. Did you not get it? I'm not seeing it. Here's your coffee. Mm-hmm. Um... Let's see. Oh, it's right there. It was emailed at 10:15 a.m. yesterday. You must've put it in the trash by mistake. Fine. That's all for now. [stammers, then sighs] Whoa. Wait. Wait a second. What's this? "Wilson Taylor: Christmas 365." This... This isn't what I asked for. It's "Christmas 365." It's a new marketing campaign I've been working on. Christmas is the most fun time of year, right? So it's about keeping the spirit of Christmas alive 365 days a year. You know, the spirit of family and love, and remembering what's most important. I just thought, with all of his brands and companies, that the Wilson Taylor Group would be the perfect fit. What I'm proposing is, we take all of his individual websites and create this exciting new community, and combine that with an innovative new loyalty program that... Did I ask for this? Oh, no, that's right, I didn't. I just thought-- You're a junior web designer, Sara. You understand that concept, don't you? Me, Director of Marketing. You, Junior Web Designer. Of course, but if you would just let me finish-- I mean, you throw me ideas, I take-down, we spitball, we collaborate, I send them back to you, but, at the end of the day, we know whose ideas they are. Does that make sense? But... Just give me a heads-up next time you send them over, and, remember, let's leave the big-picture stuff to me. Of course. Sorry. You didn't know. [♪♪♪] "Leave the big-picture stuff to me." He said that? He actually said that? He did. And that's not even the worst of it. The worst part is, I just stood there and I said nothing. I mean, I can't believe I let him treat me that way. You have got to learn to stand up for yourself, my friend. Be more assertive! Here. Thank you. Great. You know, I am just gonna go in there and I'm gonna put Dirk in his place, and I'm gonna tell him that I'm done being a doormat. You most definitely should. Never mind. It's not gonna make a difference, anyway. Okay, look. Let's just drop it for tonight, okay? It's Christmas, and we're at a Christmas party! Best time of the year, right? You're right. It is. You know what? I'll just drop it for now. Good. And tomorrow, next week-- we can talk about what a slimeball Dirk is. Deal? Deal. This place is just spectacular-looking. That's my girl. [♪♪♪] Hello. And so it gives me great pleasure to welcome the man who has built this company into what it is today. Our founder and CEO, the one and only... Peter Williams. [applause] Thank you, everyone, for making this year a great one. It's because of each and every one of you that this company has had the success that it has. Now, as most of you know, we have been working round the clock developing a pitch for the Wilson Taylor Group. And... I'm very excited to announce that Dirk has brought me a pitch that is even making me a fan of Christmas. It's an idea that's dedicated to keeping the spirit of Christmas alive, every day of the year. He calls it "Holidays 365." Dirk, come on up here, take a bow. [applause] [♪♪♪] In fact, I am so excited about this, I've invited Dirk to come with me to Seattle, to bring the idea to Mr. Wilson Taylor himself. So thank you, everybody, and merry Christmas. [applause] Okay, everybody, enough shop talk! This is a party! And it's time now for our annual "Secret Santa" gift exchange. Merry Christmas to you all. Enjoy! [applause] [♪♪♪] Thank you. Appreciate it. I'm-I'm gonna go. What? No! No, no. Don't go. I'm fine. Honest. Just have fun. [♪♪♪] [gasps] Oh! I'm sorry, Miss. I didn't mean to startle you... but you forgot your present, and I chose it just for you. Oh! Really? Thank you so much. You are most welcome. And Merry Christmas to you. O-Of course. Merry Christmas to you, as well. [♪♪♪] Uh... hmm. Hey! What are you doing? I am stopping you from leaving a perfectly good party, just to sulk and go home. No, that's not what I'm doing. Please, I've known you since the seventh grade. I know you better than you know you. Did you hear what Peter just said? Dirk stole my pitch. I mean, he took my work and just passed it off as his own. I know. I mean, the nerve of Dirk! Who does that? It's just wrong. It is wrong. What can I say that you don't already know? Dirk has no integrity. It's not like he hasn't done it before. I just want you to stop, calm down, take a deep breath. You can't let him ruin your day and night. Having someone steal your work is awful. I get it. I'm sorry it happened. What do you got there? Oh, it's, uh, my gift from "Santa." Ooh, a Secret Santa! Well, come on, then, let's check it. Who knows, maybe it is a coupon for a spa day. Well, after this day... [♪♪♪] Huh. Well? What is it? Was I right? [♪♪♪] "Merry Christmas. "This coupon entitles you to one free wish. "Whatever you wish for, your heart's deepest desire, "is about to come true. "But be forewarned, it will only come true for the next 48 hours." Huh. Wow. No Hawaii? No spa day? Not even a lousy mani-pedi? Yeah, I can barely contain my excitement. I think maybe you should have a little word with your secret "Santa". Yeah, I'll get right on that. Go. Go back to the party. Oh, come on, you're coming too. Just for a few minutes. [gasps] Is that Mark? Oh! Go. Go, go, go. Okay. You're right behind me, right? I'm not gonna stay, but I will come back for an eggnog. Just one. -Promise? -Promise. Okay. Holding you to it. [footsteps receding] Not too crazy about your present, I gather? Where did you--? How did you--? I'm-I'm sorry... I just-- After the day I've had, I'm not much into wishes right now. You should give it to someone else. Oh, ho, ho, ho! Doesn't work that way, I'm afraid. That one's for you, and you alone. That's very kind, but really... So what would it be? If you did want to wish for something, if you could have anything at all? If I wanted to wish for something? I'd like to know. Well... I... If I wanted to wish for something... I think I would wish to have courage, for a change. Really? Yes, really. I would wish that I could be brave. I wish I could stand up for myself and stop letting people treat me like I'm a pushover. I wish I was strong enough to speak up when I felt I had an opinion that needed to be heard. Well... that's a lot of wishes. Sorry. I mean, you asked. Funny, you don't strike me as a person who lacks courage. Really? Don't know what to tell ya, but I do. Well... that's a pretty tall order. You sure you don't want to ask for something a little simpler? A million dollars, maybe? No. [laughs] No, I think that's what I really want. I guess I'll talk to my elves and see what they can do. [laughs] Fantastic. You do that. Okay, then. Then I wish you a Merry Christmas again, Sara. Uh... you too. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [chuckles] [♪♪♪] I'm happy you came back. One eggnog. That's it, that's all, okay? I'm so glad you didn't bail on me. [Molly]: Look at him. So smug. [♪♪♪] No! Sara! Sara? What are you doing? [♪♪♪] Oh. What's wrong, Sara? There something you want to say? You know what, Dirk? I actually do have something I want to say. It really bothers me that you treat me with zero respect. I have been a creative and supportive subordinate to you. I've given you so many ideas and made you look so good, and to see you stand up there tonight, and take my idea and pretend like it's your own, that's just not right! You know that idea wasn't yours! Now, Sara... [awkward chuckle] Let's think before we speak. Did you think that if you called it, what, "Holidays 365" instead of "Christmas 365," that I wouldn't notice? Do I need to remind you who you're speaking to? You may have fooled everyone else, Dirk, but you and I both know what you did tonight. Wow. I got to say I am shocked, Sara, and... What's going on here? It's-- It's nothing, Peter, really. I-I can handle it. Hi, Peter. What's going on here is I'm done with Dirk taking my work and passing it off as his own. I'm a team player, and I understand that part of my job is giving creative suggestions to my boss, but enough is enough! 85% of his proposals are my proposals. I mean, if it's not Taylor's "Holidays 365", or the Quincy Proposal, or-- -Or the Parker thing? -Or the Parker thing! [Molly]: And the Hunter's pitch. Their entire campaign. [Sara]: Yes! The Hunter's pitch. That was mine, too! Thank you, Molly. [♪♪♪] I'm sorry for making a scene at your party, but I just-- I can't work for Dirk if this is how I'm going to be treated. I'm sorry, I just can't. Yeah! [scoffs] Wow. Peter, I am sorry. I-I-I will take care of this. Sara? Sara! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you okay? I am done with people treating me like a sucker. Oh, come on, people don't think you're a sucker. They do, Molly. You do, Molly. What? No, I-I don't treat you-- No, I love you, I really do, but it's not a "compliment" to ask me to do your work. And it's more than a "favor" when you ask me to bring coffee for you and everyone else in the office every day. And just because I say yes, that doesn't mean that-- I am so sorry. I don't-- I don't know why I said that. No. You're right. I have been treating you like that. [stunned chuckle] I have been taking advantage of you. Sara, I'm so sorry. Molly, I don't know what's happening to me. I just feel so different. I've never felt this way before. It's like I... It's like I'm unstoppable! [laughs] It's like I... [quietly]: No. No way. That's not possible. What? Did my wish come true? When you left, I was talking to that Santa guy and... I wished that I could be brave. Santa? I wished that I would have courage for a change. I wished that I would stop letting people just walk all over me. And it's like, all of a sudden, I just feel... I feel fearless. [laughs] It's like if I have something I feel I need to say, I'm gonna say it. I mean, crazy as it sounds... I think my wish came true. [♪♪♪] [Molly]: What are you doing? After last night, I'm fairly certain I don't have a job anymore. Well, what if you talked to Peter? Try explaining it a bit? Or apologize to Dirk, maybe? I have nothing to apologize for. I just, I don't think this is the right place for me anymore. [quiet gasp] Are you sure about that? I am. [♪♪♪] Yes, mm-hmm. Absolutely. You heard the title right. It's "Christmas 365." Christmas. Mm-hmm. Okay, listen. Thank you so much. I have got to call you back. Bye-bye. Sara! Sara, Sara. I'm glad I caught you. Listen, I have to talk to you. I really don't think we have much to talk about. Well, if you'd just hear me out, that-- You're leaving? I am. I don't think this company's the right fit for me anymore. Right, that's why I-- And I am so sorry if I caused you any grief by having that confrontation with Dirk at the party last night. No, I understand. But just for the record, the pitch was mine, "Christmas 365". It was my idea. So good luck with it, and, uh, Merry Christmas. Bryan! Yeah, boss? [♪♪♪] Um, boss? [wheezing] I thought your pitch was brilliant. But how did you--? Stairs. Oh. Listen. I believe you! I know that this was your pitch. Which is why I am not taking it to Wilson Taylor without you. Which is also why I have a huge favor to ask you, and I know this is completely last-minute, but... is there any chance you could come to Seattle with me? As in today? As in, our flight leaves in two hours? But I... I mean, last night, at the party, I made such a scene. This is me with my stuff walking out of the building. -Don't. -I know that... Please don't resign. But what about Dirk? Dirk is no longer with the company. Oh. Okay, so let me just get this straight. You just want my help with this project? I want your help with this project, but I also want you to continue working for me, Sara. Wilson Taylor is just the start. From what I've seen, you really understand marketing, not just web design, and you need to be the one presenting Christmas 365. And after that, if we're successful, there is a Director of Marketing position that needs to be filled. [panting]: Hey, boss. Can you sign this for-- And just so we're clear-- this does come with a pay raise. Fairly significant. Okay, well, there, uh, there would be some visual aids that I would need. Whatever you need. And, I mean, Christmas is in two days-- I have to be back, so I can be with my mom and sister. Done. It's done. Really? Then okay! Great! Great. I'm in. Oh, and one more thing. You should wear your navy suit. It's your best look. It really brings out your baby-blue eyes. [gasps] Uh... [♪♪♪] Uh, yeah. Okay. I guess I could do that. Is that it? Yeah. That's it. [chuckles] Yeah, that's it. Uh, Molly? Can you bring me to the airport? 'Cause I--I, um, I'll explain in the car. Y-Yeah. Sure. Great! Okay. My "baby-blue eyes"? Ah, I don't know. They're more aquamarine to me. You weren't asking me about your eyes. No. [gulps] Could you sign this, boss? They're kinda sky-blue! [♪♪♪] I'm so worried. What happens when this thing runs out? I mean, I'm gonna need this courage to do this pitch. Don't worry! You still have, what? Uh, 32 hours. Yeah, and your pitch is later today. It's more than enough time. You got this. I can do this. -Mm-hmm! -I can do this. -Yep! -Oh... hi! Oh. Hi. Thank you for coming so fast. I really appreciate this. We should hurry. All right, I'll be back by Christmas. Okay! Maybe you could actually buy me a gift this year. Goodness, I can't wait until after Christmas, when this whole wish thing is over. -Thanks. Bye. -Bye. [♪♪♪] Hmm. I'm impressed. Seriously. Well, I'll take that as a compliment. Especially coming from a man who just yesterday said "Christmas isn't happening". I mean, not that I was eavesdropping, I really wasn't. We were in an elevator. [chuckles] Okay. Well, you're kind of misquoting me. I mean, hearing one side of a partial conversation is sort of like reading into a text message, it does not a meaning make. Fair enough. You know, it's kind of funny that you're so excited about a pitch about Christmas, but you don't even like Christmas. I don't like Christmas? Well, that's why I hire people like you. If my employees are excited, then I'm excited. I mean, it's basic rules to a successful business. And you are wearing snowman earrings after all. I feel Christmas 365 is probably in good hands. Right? Right now I want to hear if there's any concerns you have. Mm... Wilson Taylor. What's he like? Oh, Wilson Taylor is a shark. The man is notoriously difficult. He didn't make his billions being Mr. Nice Guy. When we're dealing with this guy, we have got to bring our "A"-game. "A"-game. Got it. Listen, there is something that I feel like I need to share with you, since we're gonna be doing this pitch together. We need this account. Okay. I mean, I assumed that... Our sales have been flat the last two quarters. I don't want to have to lay people off. I hate doing that. [♪♪♪] Mr. Taylor sends his regrets, but he's decided to go with someone else. He does realize we flew all the way from Chicago just for this meeting, right? We apologize for any inconvenience, but the decision has just been made. Well, can you at least tell us who he gave the account to? I'm sorry. I'm not at liberty to discuss that at this time. [frustrated sigh] I think you can realize how important this is to us. I mean, we flew-- There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll excuse me. We're not leaving until we meet with Mr. Taylor. I'm sorry? You either tell us where he is, or we'll just go find him ourselves. I find it extremely disrespectful that he would go with someone else without calling to cancel with us first. Here we are, we have a meeting scheduled. That's just the bottom line. I'm not sure what to tell you, except that Mr. Taylor is a very busy man. I can assure you we have a pitch we believe your boss is not going to want to miss. It'll be worth his while. I promise you. Will you excuse me? Wow. Uh, I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It just came out. I just couldn't-- This is Wilson Taylor. He is notorious for this. Yeah. I apologize. Oh, here she is. Good news! Mr. Taylor has agreed to see you. But I'm afraid he has already left for a Christmas getaway. Do you know the town of White Ridge? Yeah, I've heard of it. He's in the main lodge. He'll see you at 2:00. You have been extremely helpful, Megan. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Is it far away? It's up at the ski hill. We can make it, if we hurry... but we're gonna need a car. Let's go. You believe this guy? We come all the way out here, and he wasn't even gonna see us? Now he expects us to drive out to a ski lodge? That's Wilson Taylor, ladies and gentlemen. I guess when you're a kazillionaire, you figure you can treat people any way you please. [laughing] What? It's a-- It's a thing. Really? Is that before or after a "gazillionaire"? Before. Well, I don't care if you are a kazillionaire, you don't treat people like this. Try telling that to him. We better hurry up. In order for me to give you a car, I need to see your name on the reservation. I don't know what to do for you. I wanna go home now, Mom. I know, sweetie. I know. Just a few more minutes. I don't know what to tell you. There's nothing I can do. It's Christmas. We're just trying to get home. I don't see your name and I don't have any more cars. Sorry, folks. You got a ton of cars in your lot! It's Christmastime, the busiest time of the year. They're all reserved. I hope you have a reservation. No. [dry chuckle]: Oh, ho, ho. [mother]: I understand this isn't your problem, but it's our problem. We're stuck here with all of these gifts-- Hi. Hi there. I like your earrings. Oh, thank you. My name is Sara. What's yours? Amy. Amy? Well, it's very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Sara. We're gonna miss Christmas. Santa won't know where to find me. You're gonna miss Christmas? [Hank]: ...Try to call our reservation line, and see if they can deliver a car. Something like that, but I c-- I can't handle that right now. I got my own problems. Excuse me. "Hank"? That's the name. Sara, we really have to-- You do realize that it's Christmas Eve tomorrow night, right? Mm-hmm. And you see you have this little girl here? Wouldn't you like her to be home for Christmas? You know, so... [whispers] Santa can find her? I have rules to follow, Miss. I'm sure you do, but those rules can be bent, just a little... just this once. [♪♪♪] Please, Mister? [♪♪♪] I mean... I'll go get the keys. Yay! That's the last car, folks. Sorry. Okay, let's go. I'm impressed. Honestly? I am too. We really got to go. I can't thank you guys enough, really. You all set? Yes, I think we are. Mm-hmm. Really, you did not have to do that for us. Of course. It's Christmas. Everyone should be home for the holidays. Well, what are you guys gonna do? They're all booked up in there. I am trying to find us a car right now. Well, where are you headed? To White Ridge. Well, why don't you hop in? We're headed right through there. Oh! No, no. We don't want to slow you down. Oh, nonsense. Amy? What do you think about us giving these two nice people a ride? Sure, Sara! Sit beside me! [laughter] I guess that means you're in the front. -Uh-huh! -Okay.

We're literally right outside, we're, like, a minute away. Uh-huh. Sure, I'll hold. They're canceling on us. What? Apparently, Mr. Taylor doesn't take too kindly to people being late. Apologize to them and tell them we appreciate the value of Mr. Taylor's time, but we've come a very long way and we're not leaving without having our meeting. Yeah. I can't-- I can't tell her that. You-You should tell her that. -No way. -Really, you should say it. Yeah, hi, Megan. I'm still here. Please, let me try. Let me try. Please? Give me the phone? Exc-- Okay. Could you hold on a second? Megan! Hi! Hi, yes, it's Sara Thomas. Listen, we are so sorry for being late, and we appreciate the value of Mr. Taylor's time, but we've come a very long way and we're just not leaving until we have our meeting. Yes, I can hold. Okay, so, she wasn't wild about that. So what? We don't get a Christmas card. Big deal. [chuckles] I'm here. Yes. We can-- [stammers] She hung up. [sighs] It's okay, right? You tried. But she did push our meeting till tomorrow morning. You're welcome. [laughs] [laughing] [♪♪♪] Okay. Thank you. We're all set. The rental car's on its way, and Cortney said she'll have us on a flight out tomorrow afternoon. I am gonna get you home for Christmas. I promise. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks for sticking with me on this. Of course! Yeah, I'm just happy that our pitch is still a go. Listen, if I was a little pushy back there, it's-- It's just that... Recently, I sort of feel like when I want to speak my mind, I just feel-- You saved the pitch. Good. -[both chuckle awkwardly] -All right, um... So, your-your mom and your sister and you guys, you get together every Christmas? Oh, of course! Yeah, my mom goes all out. I mean, getting ready for Christmas is half the fun. You know, you should... You should try it sometime. I'll consider it. [laughs] Okay. You coming? Yes. I'm coming. All righty. [♪♪♪] Aww, this is so beautiful. [Clerk]: Hello. I'll be right with you. [Sara, laughing] [Peter]: Yeah, it's festive. Welcome to the White Ridge Inn! Peter! Is that you? [Peter]: Brant! [Brant]: How are you, my friend? Good to see you, Brant! Good to see you! Brant, this is my colleague, Sara. Hi, Brant. Hello, colleague Sara. Pleased to meet you. So you're home for the holidays? No, we're just here for business, actually. We got a meeting tomorrow, and then we head straight back. Really? You're not staying for Christmas? Aw, come on! Nobody does Christmas like your folks! Ahh, yeah. Look. The-The town's all booked up, this close to Christmas. You wouldn't happen to have a couple extra rooms, would you? Yeah, I'm sure we could figure something out. Anything for family! But you're not staying with your parents? Not this time. We really-- We can't stay long, so. Wait, I'm confused. Did you grow up in White Ridge? Yeah. I didn't-- I didn't mention that? No, I don't believe you did. Huh. Surprise. [laughs] Tell you what, put your bags down, let me check on some things, give me five minutes, and we'll figure something out. Thank you so much. Okay? All right. [sighs] All right. [Brant]: Well, I gotta tell ya, it is so good to see you. You too. [woman]: Peter? Is that you? Hey! Look who's here. I can't believe it's you! Oh, I'm so happy to see you. You too. Sara, Aunt Lizzie. She owns the place. Oh, hi. It's a pleasure to meet you. Oh, the pleasure's all mine. I can't believe you surprised us for Christmas. Oh, no, it's just a business trip. We can't stay, Lizzie. Oh. Listen, I'm heading over to your folks'. Got a big night planned. Gonna decorate some cookies, and help your folks pick up a tree. It's kind of a tradition in our family. You are planning on coming, right? No, actually, we're not. But we'll do it another time. Peter. You should come. You're more than welcome. Both of you. Yeah, I don't think so. Are you sure? Because I think it sounds like so much fun. Why don't we all just move on, yeah? That's all we're asking for, Peter. It's time to let it go. That's not what I meant. Not today. It's Christmas. I think we should go. And you know what? if you don't want to, maybe I'll join you. Assuming that's okay? Yes! Of course. You'd be more than welcome. Great! I love the holidays. I mean, don't you? And decorating cookies is so fun! We have to work on a pitch. Where's your Christmas spirit? Work can wait. Actually, no, it can't. What if we're back by 10:00? And we are pitching Christmas. I mean, come on, think of it as-- it's homework. 8:00. We have to be back at 8:00. Deal. Let's go! [Sara and Lizzie laugh] All right. Here we are. Don't worry, it'll be okay. [♪♪♪] I don't believe it! Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Merry Christmas! Oh, Mom. It is so good to see you. [♪♪♪] Mom, this is Sara. We work together. Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Sara! You as well, Mrs. Williams. Oh, please, call me Barb. Now come on in. I've already made the cocoa. I don't-- I don't think so, Mom. I think I'm just gonna-- Well, you know, I think that sounds lovely. Thank you! Come on, honey. [sighs heavily] Wow, your home is-- this is just beautiful! Well, my sister knows how to do Christmas right. Thank you. We are very festive. Is this for me? Oh! This is delicious. It's so adorable. Yeah, Mom's cocoa is basically famous. Aww. Mm. All right, where are those cookies? Oh, yes, now have a seat, take off your coats. I'll be right back. Okay. I'm gonna sit right here. Okay, here we are, folks. Help yourselves to what you need. I mean, you guys really know how to do Christmas. Well, get to it, honey. You love decorating cookies. You know, it's-- it's been a really long time. So, yeah, I think I'm just gonna supervise. You guys are doing great. Aww. I mean, for the record, I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid, so. Oh, well, let me ask you, are you planning on eating some of these cookies? Maybe. Then get to it. You don't decorate the cookies, you don't eat them. [laughter] Would you mind if I grabbed some more hot chocolate? Oh, no, of course not. Let me help you. No, no, no, no. You're knee-deep in icing. I can grab it. Okay, well, it's in the pot on the stove in the kitchen. Thanks. [TV playing] [man]: Honey, is that you? Oh, sorry. I'm actually not, um... Oh. Hello. You must've come with my... Peter. I did. Mr. Williams, I'm Sara Thomas. I work with your son. Sorry to have bothered you. Uh, could you ask my wife to save me some of her cookies? There's none better. Sure, but... don't you want to join us? Thanks. I'd prefer to watch the game. Well, I must tell you, you are missing out on the fun. Family tradition. Don't you want to see your son? Young lady, you're wading into some pretty deep waters, and I'd appreciate it if you kept your nose out of my family's affairs. [♪♪♪] I'm sorry, I know I should mind my own business, but you don't seem to be a Packers fan, but I'm not gonna hold that against you. Ohh... well, that's interesting. Is that a moose on a toboggan or something? Kind of looks like a duck to me. It's a Christmas tree. How do you not see that? [sisters laughing] Peter... Maybe you should go and talk to your father. If he wants to talk to me, he can come in here. It's been two years, honey. Two years since I've been able to have the family together during Christmas. Do you remember what Christmases used to be like? Maybe he shouldn't have picked Christmas Eve dinner to give me an ultimatum on my future. [game playing quietly] You like football? Oh, Green Bay. Born and bred. [Sara chuckles] Yeah, my dad taught me everything he knew. Some of my happiest memories are going to the games with him. Just spending time together, you know? Just the two of us. Well, nothing like a little parent/child bonding at a game. Cheering the good guys on. Yeah. [laughs] That's the thing, though. Um... My dad's not around anymore. Oh. We lost him six years ago. Just no warning. You know, completely out of the blue. I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks. I know that we don't know each other, and this is probably really out of bounds, but I just have to say that, whatever it is... whatever it is between you two, I... I hope you can let it go. So... [sighs] Tell us about Sara. What about her? She seems lovely. Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, she's-- I don't know that much about her, actually. I mean-- What? We work together. And you know nothing about her? Well, no, I mean, she's... she's smart and, um, she's-she's really, really great at her job. And she's attractive. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, well, I might... I might have noticed that, but I... we're colleagues. I am not going to jeopardize our business relationship even entertaining this, so I certainly don't want her to think that I'm hitting on her. Okay, fine, fair enough. It's Christmas. Well, I'm sure Peter's Christmases in Chicago are good enough these days, so. He works. Peter, your son, he actually... he's worked every Christmas for the past couple years. On-On-On Christmas? Yeah. Which is too bad, 'cause he has this... this really wonderful, loving family that he should be with. It's really nice meeting you. Enjoy the game. Oh, and I'll get you those cookies. Okay, fine, fair enough. Just when's the last time you dated, sweetheart? Mom. Ahem. Hi. [chuckling] Did you go all the way to the North Pole for that cocoa? Was that a joke? Wait a second, did I just hear a Christmas joke out of Peter Williams? Yeah. Don't get used to it. [♪♪♪] Last call for Christmas tree pick-up? [♪♪♪] Tree. [Peter]: Okay! Well, that one's good. That's the first one. [Lizzie]: Here, toss this one up there, too. I need it for the Inn. [Peter]: Oh, okay. Looks heavy! Oh, it is! There we go. Can you pass me the rope, Mom? [grunts] There. Thank you. Make sure they're on tight, sweetheart. Oh, yeah. It's gonna be snug as a bug on Christmas Eve. Okay, I'm gonna go pay for the tree, honey. Oh, wait for me. I need to pay, too. Here, throw me the rope. Oh, no, it's okay. I can get it from here. No. Throw it to me. I was a Girl Scout for seven consecutive years, so, throw me the rope. Okay, you sound a little proud about that. You know what? I am kind of proud of that. And knots were my favorite, so... Here we go. Uh, that's some nice work there. Oh! Ow... You okay? Nothing, nothing. It's fine. It's just a-- Let me take a look at it. No, no. It's just a rope sliver. It's fine. It's just a rope sliver. It's not a big deal. Let me see. Let me see. Our top Girl Scout has got herself a rope silver, ladies and gentlemen. -Don't. [laughs] -I'm sorry. Just kidding. I know, these things can be the worst. Especially if it-- Oh, here it is! Oh. Ow! I got it. Did you get it? Yeah. You got it. -Yeah. -Well, thanks. What can I say? I was a Boy Scout for seven consecutive years and rope-sliver-pulling was kind of my "thing," so. [laughs] Well, thank you. You saved my finger. Well, if it happens again, you know where to find me. I'll be here at least-- well, we're here on this trip, like tonight, I mean, together. I know what you mean. Yeah. [chuckling] You know, I was-- I was thinking, that after this, we should probably head back to the B-and-B, and tomorrow's a pretty big day. We got a lot riding on it. We should probably get to work. I'm ready for this pitch. I mean, this proposal is... it's my life, and keeping the spirit of Christmas alive does not involve going back and sitting in a hotel room. In fact, you know what? I think you need a little Christmas-101-spirit training. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You're really that into Christmas? What's not to be into? Christmas 365 spawned from me wanting to decorate earlier than the department stores do. How much earlier? Like before Halloween? Oh, I would say before Easter, if it was up to me. [laughing] But, the more I started developing it, I realized it's not just about decorations, it's-it's about feeling. Feeling what? What other time of year is as magical as this? Really. I mean, people go out of their way to help each other. It's the season of giving. I mean, why can't we all feel a little love, 365 days a year? [♪♪♪] [Sara] Only 21 hours left. This better happen soon. [♪♪♪] Aw, are you sure you can't stay? We got lots of room. I know, Mom, but Lizzie's got two beautiful rooms, all set up for us at the Inn. Oh, make sure that you take her on the full tour, because the downtown is so beautiful this time of the year. [Peter]: Are you sure you're okay with us walking? You don't need help? I mean, you have two trees. Don't worry about it. I'm a professional Christmas tree-wrangler. We'll see you back at the inn. Ah, I love you, honey. I just wish you and your father would find a way-- Mom, don't. It is what it is and I would rather not talk about it. Just remember, nobody's perfect, Peter. Not me, not you, not your Dad. If only you knew how alike you two are. This stubbornness... Mom. Okay. It was lovely to meet you. Thank you for taking care of my son. You are very welcome. It was so nice to meet you. Best Christmas present ever. [♪♪♪] [car engine starts] Bye, Mom. Love you. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm-- I'm good. Listen, I'm sorry if I pushed you to go to your parents' house. I understand now that that wasn't easy for you. You really are something. [♪♪♪] So are you gonna give me a tour of the town, or what? We've actually seen most of it, but... we could walk down Main Street, and it'll take us back to the inn. All right. Come on. [♪♪♪] Hey-hey. Here we go! Ah! Go ahead. [laughs] Oh, come on. [♪♪♪] You know... I thought a lot about what you said, about the spirit of Christmas. And when I was a kid, I mean, I just loved it. I mean, Christmas was about wishes that always came true, and there's nothing better than believing in the magic of it all. That's the best part. Right, but then you get older, and the lines begin to blur. And for me, that's when the magic faded. How so? Well, my dad made me choose between him and what I wanted. And when I chose what I wanted... my wishes... from my dad's perspective, the magic died. I don't understand. It was when I dropped out of law school. My dad had this dream of me joining him at his firm, being his partner, living in this town. It all sounded nice. But the only problem was, that was his dream, not mine. And he took it pretty hard. Well... as you can see. Sorry. This pitch is one of the most important things to happen to my company in a really long time. It's your Christmas wish. Yeah. Okay. That's enough of me talking. I think it's only fair that I ask you about your life. Oh, sure, ask away. What would you like to know? Well... there's one thing that I was wondering about. We've had a dozen meetings over a couple years, and you haven't said more than five words. Was that Dirk? No. No. That's not... That wasn't Dirk. I just... I don't know, I've always had a really hard time speaking up. [laughing] You're joking, right? No, I'm serious. I guess I just was really shy. Well, it seems like you got over it. And I, for one, am glad you did. It was actually my dad who always encouraged me to speak up for myself. He passed away about six years ago. I'm sorry. Oh, thank you. He was my best friend. I miss him so much, especially... especially around Christmas. ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn King ♪ ♪ Peace on Earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪ ♪ Joyful all ye nations rise ♪ [Sara joining in]: ♪ Join the triumph ♪ ♪ Of the skies ♪ ♪ With angelic hosts proclaim ♪ ♪ "Christ is born in Bethlehem" ♪ ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn King ♪♪ [chuckles] That was so beautiful.

Brant already hit the hay, and I'm feeling spent after helping your parents with their tree, so this one is all yours. Lizzie, I'd love to, but we got to focus on the pitch a little bit. We both probably should. Pitch-smitch. It's Christmas! I'll bring you a plate of decorated cookies and my world-famous pumpkin pie. The best pie this side of the Rockies. That is true. You-You think she's bossy now? You should've seen her when I was a kid. I heard that! [laughs] Okay. -Thank you. -There you are. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Okay! Ready for this? So are you really working on Christmas? I mean, is work so all-consuming, that you can't take one day off? Well, the wheels of commerce keep on spinning, or so they say. Yeah, but making people work on Christmas. It's Christmas! I mean, people shouldn't feel like their jobs are on the line if they don't want to work. People's jobs would never be on the line. But do you tell them that, when you ask them to work? That's a good point. I haven't. But I will. Thank you. Good. For the record, though, I do pay them time and a half. Oh, time and a half. You don't say? Oh, you don't think that's fair? Well, now that you're asking, I'm gonna tell you-- no, I don't. I think that you should be paying them at least double. And I also think you should do something really nice for them, like get them presents, or, uh, or bring them Christmas dinner, you know, with holiday crackers, like the little things that you crack open, they have prizes inside? Oh, and stockings, everyone should have a stocking that Santa can fill. Anything else? You should write their names on the stockings. That'd be a really nice touch. Okay. Now, how am I supposed to do that? I'm sure, if you wrap your head around it and think about it a little, well, you can-- you'll figure something out. This trip has not been anything like I expected it to be. Oh, you're wishing you were here with Dirk, right? Is that what you wanted to say? 'Cause you can say it. Okay. You are so refreshingly honest. It is really nice to spend time with you. You're so open and you speak your mind. I'm really happy that I got to take this trip with you and get to know you. I had a really good time today. Me too. [♪♪♪] The tree looks great. I think it's finished, right? It is, at that. I should probably get upstairs and, you know, finish my... well, just review everything for tomorrow. Yes. Me too. You want a midnight snack? Yes! I just have to say, I think your Christmas spirit has improved tremendously. Oh, yeah? [laughs] And Christmas 365-- that what it's all about. You know, everything that we did today.

The meeting is not gonna get pushed again. Taylor's not gonna want to drag this on until Christmas. Uh, actually, I have to go. Wish me luck. So much luck. Thanks. Great. Hi! You all set to go? Uh, yeah. Ready if you are. Yeah. You okay? Yes. I'm... Yeah. I... You sure? Honest truth? I... I'm nervous, but I'm confident. I mean, I'm ready. I know I'm more than ready. Well, perfect. Just stay focused on... I've also never done anything like this before and I know we have a lot riding on it. And I don't want to disappoint you. I don't want to disappoint myself. Listen. I'm nervous, too. I mean, who wouldn't be, right? And... I don't want to disappoint you, either. Just be yourself. Maybe not quite as bold, but... [laughing] Great. We got this. Thanks. [♪♪♪] So, the thing to remember is don't take anything this guy says or does personally. I can't believe he has us waiting outside in the snow. [chuckles] I know. The stories of how difficult this guy can be are legendary. It's just his way. Don't let it throw you. The work that you did on this pitch, it speaks for itself. You've got nothing to worry about. Thanks. So, how about we get in there, I do the introductions, let you get set up? And then, when I give you the sign, go for it. Okay. So just wait for the sign, and go for it. Great. Oh, one thing, though. What is the sign? [laughs] How about, um... "Sara, you take it from here"? Just "Sara, you take it from here"? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. I can remember that. He's ready for you. [exhales deeply] Okay. Tell her she's completely authorized to disburse those funds. It's in the memo from last week. She should have it. I put that in an email blast a long time ago. That was our original plan, but you know that. You'll get a copy. Okay, thanks. I'll get back to you. So... let me get this straight. I already saw a pitch that I signed off on, and you two want to somehow persuade me into changing my mind. That about cover it? Mr. Taylor, it's an honor to meet you. I'm Peter Williams, and this is my colleague, S-- No, no, no, no, no! Why don't you guys just go ahead and grab a table? Have a brief meeting. I'll be right there. And order me a hot toddy, will you? Make it a double. Okay, Peter Williams Marketing of Chicago, Illinois. You got two minutes. Amaze me. Okay, well, thank you for taking the time to meet with us. I think what you're gonna find-- Of course I want a window. Why are you bothering me with this? If that's your pitch, let's just hear it. Clock's ticking. Great, um, I was just waiting for my computer to boot up, But, um, yeah, I'll just get started. So when we were looking at your account, it didn't take long to realize-- Did you tell them that it's me? We are not waiting 20 minutes for a table! You have them seat you right now, unless they prefer I take it up with Randall Walker, a close personal friend of mine who just happens to own this place. Let's just cut to the chase, shall we? Great, okay, well, it boils down to a campaign that we call "Christmas 365." It's about something more than just shopping. It's about having the spirit of Christmas in your heart every day of the year. Now you're talking. [chuckles] Sit tight, I'm on my way. May I continue? This gonna be much longer, sweetheart? Sweetheart? "Sweetheart." That's... [♪♪♪] Wow. You do know that we came all the way from Chicago just to see you? We traveled very far out of our way to have this meeting, and the least you could do is treat us with a little respect. Careful, missy. You're treading on thin ice here. Why would you even say that? It's patently obvious you have no interest in anything we have to say. You know, I think what we could do is just take it back a couple steps and-- Any pitch about the spirit of Christmas is clearly wasted on you. Very well. This meeting's over. [scoffing]: Over? [laughs] That's just... kind of hilarious, because you actually never even let us get started, but... And you know what? It's actually too bad, because someone like you could really benefit from a little Christmas spirit. But that's okay. Because we'll just take "Christmas 365" somewhere else, and we'll infuse their brand with the spirit of giving and community year-long, and you know what? When their sales skyrocket-- which they will-- because, you know, "give and you shall receive"-- you'll still just be sitting here, talking to your little buddy on your little thing, wondering how you could have possibly treated me like this. Is there anything you want to add? No. That about covers it. I mean, can you believe that guy? So when you said you'd never done anything like this before, you weren't exaggerating, were you? I mean, did I not just give you a heads-up in there with that guy? I could've sworn I gave you a heads-up. I know! And I-I'm sorry. It just-- I couldn't stop myself. But that guy, we were never gonna close with him. I'm sure of it. We'll never know now, will we? He was on his phone the entire time, Peter. What does that have to do anything? That is what guys like that do, they multitask. Okay, but that-- And I told you, this man is notoriously difficult. I told you-- do not take it personally. How was I not supposed to take that personally? That guy doesn't even know who you are. I doubt that he even knows your name, and even if he did, so what? He called me "sweetheart." It was disrespectful. We needed that account. I'm aware of that. The only thing that mattered here, the only thing, was landing that account. And if that meant putting up with Mr. Taylor acting like a jerk, then who cares? I care. Because I don't want to be treated like I... like I'm some sort of idiot, like I don't matter. Everyone matters. He's a client, Sara. Not your colleague. Nor does he have to be our friend. Okay, um. I'm sorry. Just let me go in. -No, no, no, no. Uh-uh. -I can talk to him. That is not happening. Please, I can fix this. It's over. Let it go. But... They're boarding. We should probably go. I'm gonna fly out tomorrow. But... you're... you're not going with me? I'm just gonna stay in town one more day. There's a few things I have to take care of. Peter, are you trying to avoid me? 'Cause-- I'm not trying to avoid you. There's just a few things I have to take care of. How many times can I apologize? I-I am so sorry. I truly am. You are gonna miss your flight. I promised I would have you home by Christmas, and that's tomorrow. So I make one mistake and that's... that's just it? You're gonna miss your flight. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] That's it. It's over. My wish is done. [♪♪♪] [humming] Thank you. [phone ringing] What can I do for you, Sara? Hi. I'm-I'm sorry to bother you, Cortney, but I was just hoping you might have some information that I need. You were the one who made the arrangements for the Christmas party, right? Mm-hmm. Like I do every year. Okay, I know this is gonna sound strange, but I was hoping that you could give me the number for the Santa that you hired. I beg your pardon? The Santa Claus. I-I-I spoke with him for a couple of minutes, and I just wanted to follow up about something. This is important, I swear. I wouldn't ask, if it wasn't. [sighs] Well, I wish I could help you out, but I'm sorry, Sara-- [Sara]: But what? Well, I didn't hire a Santa. I don't know what you're talking about, actually. There was no Santa at the party? Like I said. No Santa Claus. Seriously? Seriously. What's the big deal? Nothing. It's just... [laughs] I just, I really liked the gift that he gave me, and I was... I wanted to ask for another one. Well, I'm sorry, Sara. I wish I could help you, but... Look. If you liked it so much, why don't you just give it to yourself? There's no rule that says that you can't, you know. Thank you. [♪♪♪] I just need two minutes. Just two more minutes. [♪♪♪] Look, I know our meeting got off on the wrong foot, but I really believe that Mr. Taylor will love what we have to show him, if I could just have two more minutes of his time. I'm sorry, but no. Mr. Taylor will not see you. Not now. Not ever. I can't believe this is happening. As you might imagine, Mr. Taylor is not one for making empty threats. Look, I know I was out of bounds, and I'm-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have acted that way. But you have to admit, we weren't even given a fair shot at making our pitch. If you wish to call our office and ask to reschedule, that's your prerogative. I can assure you, however, that a second meeting will not be happening. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] I'm not seeing it, Narissa. I see page after page of boiler-plate. I'm not finding the actual deal memo anywhere. Call you back. What are you doing? I-I can't go back to the way I was. I won't be that person anymore. I can't be that person anymore. So I'd like another chance to talk. Just you and me. [♪♪♪] [knocks] Dad? [♪♪♪] [laughing] All right, people, wrap it up! Our customers are gonna have to find a way to get along without us for the next couple hours. And we got plenty for everybody. Boss, is this... Oh, yeah. You bet. It's Christmas dinner. [bag rustling] You got us gifts? [laughs] [laughs] Awesome! Thank you, everybody, e for being here with me on Christmas. And I just want to remind you, that those of you that have family at home, you are free to leave any time you want. Merry Christmas, everybody. [staff]: Merry Christmas. I think you're missing something, though. You can't have Christmas dinner without dessert. Mom? What are you doing here? Do you think that we would let you spend Christmas by yourself after what you did? Hey. There's a light out in your elevator. [laughing] Come here. Dad... Thank you for coming. [sighs] Thank you. Thank you for coming home and straightening me out. I love you, son. I love you, too, Dad. Well! Look at this place. You done good. Don't know about the decor... Okay, if you two are done, I think the food's getting cold. Okay, as of right now, we are officially too busy stuffing our faces to do anything that even resembles actual work. And did I tell you guys? I'm paying you double today. And I'm gonna top it off with my world-famous pumpkin pie. In which case, you're all in for a big treat. It's the best pumpkin pie west of the Rockies, right? Or so I've been told. Really looks like you found your Christmas spirit. Can you stay? You're more than welcome. Even though you are a Packers girl. [laughing] Thank you, but I actually can't stay. I just... I just wanted to give you this. And wish you Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, you guys. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] You... you closed the Wilson Taylor account? Wow. I mean, I'm impressed. I'm not sure I want it, but... I'm impressed. Of course you want it. You need it. And jobs are depending on it. And he's just a client. He doesn't have to be your friend. And surprisingly, you might actually come to like him. You just have to kind of tell him who's boss first. I, uh, I should let you get back upstairs to your celebration. Sara? You really are something. You know that? You've said that before, but I'm... I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. I can assure you, it's a good thing. Well, I, um... I should go. Get back to my mom and sister, they're waiting. What if I told you I wanted you to stay? Even if it's just for a little while? I would tell you I'd like that. I'd like that very much. But I have to be back by 8:00. 10:00? Don't push your luck. [both chuckling] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Peter and Sara laughing] [Peter]: I can't imagine! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Is everything okay? [♪♪♪] Yeah... It's perfect. [laughs] [♪♪♪] Come on.
