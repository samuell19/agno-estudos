To tell my countrymen how bravely they fight the enemy After all it's for us that the Army is fighting Until we back our Army to the last, our independence is at stake That maybe so. But my heart doesn't permit me. . . Silly! Nothing's going to happen to me. Send me away with a smile ''With a smile he greeted me'' ''I thought it was love'' ''Oh so mistaken I was'' ''I thought it was an expression of amour'' ''I wasn't destined to have someone. . . ''I could call my own'' ''Oh why did I think. . . '' ''I deserve love?'' ''Oh how can I weep?'' ''Oh how do I speak?'' ''I'm afraid. . . '' ''for the conclusion the world might jump to'' ''I was mistaken. . . '' ''I thought it was an expression of amour'' ''With a smile he greeted me'' ''I thought it was love'' What is the matter Didi? Your eyes. . . - No, it's nothing of the sort My eyes are a bit fatigued Another sleepless night? - I'm anxious, Didi Anxiety? Because of the war? - Are you anxious too? Me. . . ? Well. . . Tell me Everyone's anxious, Babli. Go to sleep I'm so anxious, Didi ! Oh I'm so anxious You don't know who might die! - What are you saying? Silly! Don't bring these things to your mind. Don't! Didi, why are you so worked up? I. . . For your sake, Babli. You were in tears I hate wars. It makes me cry. Tears sometimes are a blessing What do I do? I can't cry, I can't laugh. Go to sleep Captain, I hear this bridge was built only last year How come it has collapsed so soon? Under the weight of refugees crossing An incident like this in times of war? Could it be a traitor's work? Traitors are what we should call them. Those who built it, used bad cement Adulterated cement? I must expose those who have betrayed the country Read that? And it's our newspaper that publishes it Must be mere suspicion. How can they find evidence? That fool Jitendra Gupta is out there. He might've unearthed some evidence I have the key to his silence News from Tejpur brings hope. Our forces have put up. . . a determined resistance against the Chinese aggressors. . . forcing the Chinese into retreat at Tejpur A ceasefire has been announced Hello Didi. - Hello Ms Amita You know, the Chinese are in retreat! They didn't reach Tejpur That's great news! - Great news! I can't tell you what great news this is! She's so happy! This is your chance! Say it. Shoot - Shut up Did you say something? - No. Why don't you say it? - What is the matter? Bikram has been pestering me to tell you that. . . You won't ever say it! Let me say it Didi, I want to marry Babli What. . . ? No, you can't marry Babli Why not? I thought you loved me like a brother. - That may be so. But. . . I want to see Babli happy. - Babli will be very happy with me I'm certain ! - No, you are mistaken How come. . . ? - Is she in love with someone else? No. . . she has told me nothing. - Then you know something? Is there anyone else in her life? Didi, I want to listen to the radio Your sister was saying. . . - Never mind. Go on We could've found out from her. Why did you send her away? I don't think I'm answerable to you. All I'm telling you is. . . as long as I'm alive, you won't marry Babli. Never I know why! You don't want your sister to be loved. Because, for yourself you haven't had a man's love I apologise on his behalf Fool ! Get out of here You haven't had a man's love Hello Ms Amita You might be surprised seeing me here. I've just returned Be seated My suspicions about the bridge turns out to be true I've found the evidence. I want to do a series of articles Do that Think it over, Ms Amita. The person who supplied adulterated cement. . . is your partner in the paper I have no partners For the sake of the truth, publish whatever you want I'm with you I mean Mr Gupta, when did you return from Tejpur? Today Didi. . . I knew he went there. Now who told me. . . ? Who else? I might've been the one? Yes Didi ! You were the one Sit - What a lovely day! Lovely weather Isn't that so, Mr Gupta? - Oh yes Beautiful weather Let's go out somewhere, Didi ! Oh, but how can you? You got to go to the office. Mr Gupta, my sister likes nothing but work Liking anything else is no good, Babli. One ends up a loser Go on, take a day out. - I'll leave after lunch But where. . . ? Where should I go, Mr Gupta? Wherever you feel like. - Just go somewhere Mr Gupta, you must be tired. You can join office from tomorrow The fish ! Brilliant! I love gazing at fish The lake at botanical gardens is full of fish. I'm going there after lunch ''At heart I was always ecstatic'' ''You've added to it a dash of madness'' ''There's a bit of craziness in our age'' ''And some of it, because we're young'' ''And it puts a fire in our my breath'' ''And you've added to it a dash of madness'' ''True, at this moment, I'm not in my senses'' ''In the ecstasy, I might swoon in your arms'' ''Those eyes have devoured me'' ''At heart I was always ecstatic'' ''These dancing tresses, this fiery beauty'' ''Oh stop yourself, please'' ''My emotions are caught in a storm'' ''You've added to it a dash of madness'' ''At heart I was always ecstatic'' Welcome Forgive me for interrupting. - I have the whole day ahead This article has to be in by this evening About the cement factory? - Yes, please have a seat No thanks, I got to get back early Early this morning, the owners of the cement factory paid me a visit They want me to ask Ms Amita to have you fired Then you should've gone to Ms Amita directly How I wish you understood me as well as I understand you I come in hope. Hoping that you will never do a disservice to Ms Amita How can she get hurt? This newspaper earlier operated from the small building next door This new building, all this new machinery. . . the rise of this newspaper is all by dint of Ms Amita's efforts For which, she has had to borrow in millions From whom? - The very men who want you out Ms Amita's entire shareholding is mortgaged to them And the term of the loan is running out So if they want, they can also throw Ms Amita out I came to tell you just that. I leave the decision to you I am sure whatever you do will be for the best No! Mr Gupta doesn't leave! Is this your final decision? - Absolutely Forgive us, we have troubled you You're making a grave mistake The paper shouldn't pass into their hands, come what may You want me to accept their dictate? What option is there? You say, your entire stock is mortgaged to them I'm not going to be threatened ! As long as I am, Mr Gupta stays For how long? If they wish, they can have you thrown out Will Mr Gupta be able to survive afterwards? Come what may, he will leave. Why should you leave your newspaper? But how can I throw out someone who is innocent? Never! Must you be so adamant? In your life this newspaper meant everything ! Today, you don't care? Does Mr Gupta mean more to you? Give me an answer! For the sake of what. . . are you determined to ruin your newspaper, your future, your life? Why can't you fire Mr Gupta? I won't! I won't fire him! Why, I ask you ! What reason is it that's stopping you? What comes over you at the mention that he might have to leave? Could it be that you have a soft corner for Mr Gupta? Then my suspicion is true. You are in love with Mr Gupta They want to throw you out! Just let them try! We'll raze this building ! Oh but this is all stone. . . we'll raze it nevertheless We'll go on strike, red flags and all ! One of the union leaders shares a tipple with me All I got to do is ply him some, and we have a blockade Madam is in her office Where are you going? Listen. . . I'm no Chuni Lal unless I fix each and everyone of them I'll take a photo his folks won't recognise, forget his neighbours! Ms Amita. . . What's this? - My resignation Resignation? Yes. I'm quitting. - Why? Till yesterday, you were happy here. Why, all of a sudden. . . ? Nothing. I just want to leave. - Tell me the truth Has the cement lobby threatened you? Are you doing this for me? For the newspaper. More than me, this newspaper needs you But. . . I can't run this paper all alone You aren't leaving. - Please appoint another news editor Why get into trouble for my sake? Please, let me leave You are being uselessly stubborn. Take your resignation back I'm helpless, Ms Amita. My ego won't let me work here anymore All you care for is your own ego? What about someone else? The managing director's words hold no meaning for you? I don't get any of this. My departure will help keep your newspaper afloat What else is your problem? - Don't trouble me anymore! For God's sake! I don't accept your resignation ! You aren't leaving You aren't and you aren't! - Irrespective, I'm leaving Are you going somewhere? - Yes At night. . . ? Where? I'm leaving this house Come off it! Give me that suitcase. - No Didi No. . . ? You won't obey your sister? - No! I've always been afraid of you But you don't scare me anymore! Get that? What's all this happening? Why are you misunderstanding me? If I ever said anything untoward, it's for your own good, Babli I'll be the judge of that, Didi. I'm not a kid anymore Think of your own good, think of your life My life is for you. What have I left but you? If you leave me, this loneliness will drive me mad, Babli ! It'll drive me mad ! - Who's asking you to be lonely? Why don't you marry? Marry. . . ? - Yes. Get married How long will I give you company? Everyone wants to make a family I too want a home of my own Babli, sit You needn't leave home over this I'll get you married to the man you want. I'll give whatever you want Yes, whatever you want. - Then let me leave Are you too shy to tell me? I know where you want to go I know whom you want to marry. - You are mistaken Don't you lie to me. - You're so old-fashioned Talking to a man, laughing with him, doesn't mean I'm in love with him Try as you might, you aren't deceiving your sister You may assume whatever you wish. I'm leaving Babli ! I'm not letting you leave! Never! Tell me the truth ! Why do you want to leave? - Because you've lost your senses You want to force Jiten upon me! Let go of my hand No Babli ! No! Don't go away! I beg of you ! Oh why do you hate me? Babli, have pity on your sister! Babli ! Stop! For my sake! What happened? Babli went away She too is gone. . . leaving me all alone Uncle, Ms Sunita is here You. . . ? So late at night? What's the mater Sunita? Is Ms Amita all right? Didi. . . ? She looked harried today. I was concerned You care for Didi? - Who wouldn't? Why do you ask? She's fine. You must take care of her always. Else, I'll quarrel with you What are you saying? What has come over you today? Today. . . today's a happy day for me Didi, I'm getting married tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Jitu, why didn't you tell me earlier? - Are you marrying my uncle? Your uncle is just a friend of mine. The one I'm marrying, is a lovely boy Why are you silent? Won't you congratulate me? Why not? Sushma, get some sweets Sunita, are you joking? - Strange of you. . . to take the truth for a joke, and you take a joke to be true? Look into my eyes and say it. Everything was a joke? Tell me you don't love me Is it a must to marry everyone one has a light romance with? Life is to be enjoyed. That's all I know I'd hate to cry after I'm married. Were you to marry me you'd never be happy? Would it be a life of misery? That's my lot. I've been very lucky. I always liked a comfortable life I'm marrying a millionaire Congratulations How come the millionaire's bride-to-be is standing in a poor man's hovel? I don't take you for an enemy. - Thanks I shall never forget this courtesy I'm getting late Whether you sell your share or whether you pawn it. . . you aren't mortgaging my share. Just selling my shares won't help pay back Ms Amita's debts. Her debts run into millions I take the responsibility. You'll get back every cent At this point of time, you must help her Help whom? The person who wouldn't let me marry Babli? Why don't you understand? Helping her now will pave the way to marry Babli. I'm sure, she will be happy to oblige Not afterwards. Before. First I marry. Then I help Will you cash in on this crisis? - Give and take I'm your little brother - I'm ashamed of you ! Will you marry me? - Marry. . . ? Tomorrow. - Tomorrow itself? Or the day after? - Right now! Right away! Come on, let's find ourselves a priest Have you run away from home? - Yes, Hollywood style Eloping is in vogue! - Stop raving I'm not about to let this happen. How will I face your sister? Just let the wedding get over. Afterwards, I might even be willing. . . to help her tide the crisis. - What kind of crisis? All because of that Jitendra Gupta. The directors want him out Simple. Throw him out. - Why throw him out? Because he's worthless. What is he? Just a news editor He has got the board warring. I don't understand why he doesn't leave I think he's a cheap fellow What did I say? - That's what you deserve Come here You stay away from him. You will marry with your sister's consent Not her consent. Mine! I'm going to marry Bikram! Didi's photo? In your bedroom? Madam. . . Mr Verma is here Mr Verma Ms Amita. . . Are you all right? Babli has gone away and I don't know where Don't worry. She's fine. She came to my house last night Your house? - Yes She wants to marry Bikram Bikram. . . ? - Yes Why did she desert me for that? I told her she can marry whoever she wants You said that? Then why did she have to leave? I don't understand. . . if she loves Bikram, why did she slap him? What did you say? She slapped Bikram? Yes, he spoke against Mr Gupta Then it's true! Silly girl ! Why did she lie to me? I knew she doesn't like Bikram I knew it well ! I'm not going to let her ruin her life by marrying Bikram Never! I won't let this marriage happen Not Bikram. It's me Didi. Your Babli. Why are you so worried? You ask me why I'm worried? You're worried, how can I not be? But Didi. . . - You mustn't have slept all night I did. Had a sound sleep. - Liar Did you ever have a sound sleep unless your sister tucked you in? You suffer and make your sister suffer! I'll punish you ! Just you come home But Didi, listen. . . - Not a word I know. You're crying on the sly Come back. . . come back to your sister Coming. . . I'm coming right away. - Hurry! And tell Bikram, you aren't marrying him But I'm going to marry Bikram. - But why? Why are you out to destroy yourself? You too are out to destroy your happiness for my sake! How can I let this happen? No! I'm not coming Listen Babli. . . What happened? - She won't come She says, my happiness will be destroyed if she returns She said that? Meaningless drivel ! Let me see how she won't return Have I not even this right? I'm going to drag her here No Ms Amita ! Stop! I know why she's doing all this She too knows that you are in love with Mr Gupta Good God ! The only way out. . . then this is the only way Where is she? If you want to see me alive, come back to me! Babli ! Don't hide from me! Madam. . . Where's Babli? She went out with Mr Bikram. She left this note for you Didi, I knew you'd come here for me But now it's time for you to think of your own happiness By the time you receive this letter, I would've married Bikram No. . . Married already? You must give a month's notice for a civil marriage Only afterwards can I conduct the marriage But we want to get married today! - There's the law, lady I'm a government registrar. Not a priest You may fill in the notification. A month afterwards. . . you may come to get married. - But. . . Your sister left a while ago. She wasn't in a good shape What happened to her? - She read your letter Then she went insane! Didn't even recognise me. She's in bad shape Oh, what am I to do? The family always interferes till the wedding is over In a while, the two of you will patch up Didi is in a bad shape. She's so miserable. . . Where is she? - I don't know She seems to have left here in a disturbed state a while ago Didn't you have this shoulder to weep on? Why that shoulder? Mr Verma, this is Gupta. I'm calling from your residence Has Ms Amita reached home? She seems to have left a while ago in a disturbed state. Where might she have gone? There's a board meeting today. Maybe. . . We've waited long enough. Maybe Ms Amita and Mr Verma. . . don't wish to attend this meeting. - Let them not Gentlemen, the quorum is full I request Mr Gulabchand to chair the meeting Some members wish to move a no-confidence motion. . . against the managing director. We have to decide. . . whether Ms Amita remains our managing director Welcome Mr Verma. We have been expecting you No! Don't look at me like that! Don't look at me in anger! No! I know why you're angry For my sake, Babli has ruined her life! Not here. - Where might she be? At home perhaps? - Let's look in the library I think. . . I swear by you ! For the sake of your Babli, I can even give my life! Just think. The newspaper we've pumped millions into, is our enemy I went along with them for the sake of the paper! The ones I trusted turn out to be my enemies! They want to throw me out! They want to grab my father's newspaper Didi. . . - Open up I won't let them have my father's newspaper! You hear? I shall never let that be! Never! Never! Call a doctor No Mr Verma ! Not as long as I'm alive! Never! - What. . . ? After I'm gone. . . Mr Verma, call Jitendra Jiten is right here, Didi Why can't she recognise people? You want to tell Jitendra something? Tell him I haven't mortgaged Daddy's old office Let him start a new paper from here. - I shall tell him that But don't ever tell him that. . . - What. . . ? That I too. . . Never tell him that! Never! Just tell him to start a new paper The Eternal Spring will return
