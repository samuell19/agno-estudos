I ain't got time to be waiting around for the bus. - You could buy a car. - Do you know how hard it is to keep a car in the city? There ain't no parking, and if you do find parking, you got to move it all the damn time, and the insurance is way too expensive. It's all just a pain in the ass. - Why don't you just ride the subway? - Oh, too crowded. I mean, when it's working. - Oh. - The panhandlers all up in your face, and oh! And the rats. Oh no, no, fuck that. - Well it sounds like the bus is your only option. - Yeah, it is. [orchestral music continues] ♪♪ - Hey, Mom. - Let's go. We're going to miss the bus. - Can I do this? - What is it? - It says they're looking for a magician's assistant. - Magician's assistant? No, baby, I don't like things like that. - Why not? - Because it's scary. - But It's just make-believe. - No, honey. That shit is evil. - Come on. - I promise you. I'm fed up. I'm a magician. What we know is illusion. It's not magic. We have to change. I forbid it. You forbid it? This is my theater. We both built this! - It's true. - If you say so. - Oh, hi. Hi. - Sorry to interrupt. Hi. Leah has arrived. - Oh, hi, Leah. How are you? - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, nice to meet you. This is the new intern. - Intern? - Yes. - Are we paying her? - Of course not. - Okay. Hi, I'm Larry. - Hi. - What's your name? - Leah. - Nice to meet you. - Have you guys seen Dean anywhere? - Yes, he's under the stage. Dean! - Yeah? - The new girl is here! - All right. Tell them I'll be right up. - So why don't you go outside? You can meet him. He's going to come out on the stage. Go this way. - Can we meet a little later to talk over some stuff? - Of course! - I'm really happy to have you! - Pleasure. - Yvette! How are you? - Hi. - Good to see you. - Yes? - Just a little friendly reminder about the rent increase this month. - The rent increase? - Yeah, yeah, 30%, that's all. - Thirty percent? - Sure. - Who can afford that? Nobody can afford 30%. - I ain't paying. I'm actually not paying extra in this house. - It hasn't been raised in, I believe it's about 18 years, so we're going to make up for a little lost time. We had to comply with the mandate from City Hall. - You know how long I've been living in this building? - Actually, no. - Probably before you were born. - Because everybody in the building know what you're doing to everybody, so we don't want to stay still-- - But It's not me. - It's the new law from the City Council, so-- - Yeah, you're taking advantage of the law, so... - It's also a win-win, if you think about it. - I think that I'm going to see you in court and we argue that in court. - Starting on the 1st, the rent goes up. - Going to talk to my lawyer. I'll see you in court. - IB's Bust a little friendly reminder. - See you in court, all right. - Just a friendly, friendly... ...reminder. [knocking on door] - Come in. - Hello, Oscar. - Hey, Fred.

Don't you have your date tonight? - What's that? - Don't you have your date tonight? - Oh yeah, the date is tonight. Thank you for the tickets, by the way. That was very nice of you. - You're going to like the show. It's magic. - What's that? - The show, it's magic. - Oh, magic, yeah. I like magic. I'm a little nervous about the date, though. - Are you taking her out to dinner? - What's that? - Are you going to take her out to dinner? - Oh, dinner. I think we are having dinner. It's a double-date, though. The thought of being one on one with someone is a little scary. I'm going to go with my friend Jamie, he's going to take his girlfriend, and I'm going to meet this mystery girl. We'll see what she's like. - There you go. - Thank you, sir. Appreciate this. - Why don't we start renting the stage out to other artists, playwrights? - This is my theater, man. This is my show. - On Tuesday nights, for example, those are slow nights. We could do an open mic night instead. - An open mic night? - Yes. You have different performers come in. They play guitar, they recite poetry, they perform stand-up. - I'm sorry, we're not doing this here. - Well If you don't do something, you're going to lose this place. - Okay, Leah, this is how you make someone from the audience disappear in the box back into the audience. Dean, come. You make sure the box is placed in front of this hole. There's going to be a carpet here. You put the person in the box first. Then you're going to take them down through the hole in the carpet, backstage. - Yeah. - Go. You go in the hole. You're going to have to stay underneath there the entire show, and then you're going to take the person back. Come on! You go in there. - You mean come with? - No. Give me that thing. Go in there. And then you're going to go underneath this way. You're going to bring them to the backstage. Leah? - Yeah. Can you hear me? You follow me here to this side. Come on. And you're going to take them up here to the backstage. Leah? Where are you? Ok, so you bring them up here to the backstage. This has to go faster. Take this. Then we'll see you back there. - All right. - Take them up here, up the stairs. Don't bump your head here. Be very careful. Make sure the audience member doesn't trip over this. Now, you're not from Hungary? Where are you from? - No, I'm from Astoria. Kind of like Hungary. - Okay. Now, careful here, because the building inspector-- [arguing in French] They're married. Can't you tell? So, you take them here. - Ok. Oh man, what a hike. You think older people could do this? - Nope. - It's really hard. - Don't pick old people. - Ok. - You want to pick someone young, athletic. No heavy, big people, no people with very high heels. Then you take them down here. May I ask you, are you married, Leah? - Married? No. I have terrible taste in men. Are you married? - No. So now we're in the lobby again. So you take them around. Oh, and here's the lovely Dean. You see, Leah, now we're on the stage again. - Sweet. - Yeah, it's pretty sweet. - What do you think? - I think it's amazing. - Well you'll work the ticket booth tonight and watch the show with the audience, and we'll work you into the show over the next few weeks. - I don't see why we have a ticket booth. We don't sell any tickets. - Well we might try something a little different tonight. - It's impressive, you have two amazing apartments. - You have two buildings. Are you bragging about your buildings? I'm not bragging about them because I can't because they're dumps. - They're still buildings. - I'm trying to fix them up so I can brag about them, but your places-- - Guys, guys, this is the place. This is the place. Here we are. - This it? Okay. - Thank you. - Bye. - Um, this is a magic show? - Hi. Yeah. - Not the Styx concert? - No, no, that's next door if you want to go. - I think I have four tickets left for Oscar Trout. I think, yeah. - Let me look. - What do you think? - I mean, he's okay, but I think he's a little shy. - He's not really shy. He's just afraid to open his big fucking mouth. - You're not saying anything much either. - I know, but I want him to say something to me first. - You know he inherited a lot of money recently. - Stop being so tacky. - I'm just letting her know the whole situation. - She knows this already! - This is the place. - Magdalena! Magdalena! Where is she? - Underneath the stage. - Of course. - Larry! - That's how stupid I am. - We have to start! Larry, what are you-- - Shut up! Where is the book? I know you have it. - Did you take it? - No. - Give it to me! - No. I forbid it! If we don't use real magic, we're finished. Then we'll go back to Paris. Fuck Paris! My life is here! Give me the fucking book! You'll go mad, like last time. It won't be like last time. If you do this, I'm leaving you! I don't care! And viola. [door slams] - Ah! - [chuckles] All right, guys.

I hope you're in good health and relaxed and not too fearful about the future. It's a very uncertain time we're living in, of course. We're all very worried about terrorism. We are worried about the environment, worried about our health, and who amongst us is not perpetually worried about money? [chuckles] Oh, my goodness, I always forget about that. Black hat. Every magician needs a black hat. As you can see, it's empty and nothing there. Can I please have someone from the audience? You, sir. What is your name? - Clifford. - Clifford. That's a charming name. You're a handsome fellow. How are you feeling these days? - Pretty good. - Good. Me, I'm feeling very empty as of late. Take this hat, if you will. Please look at it and verify that it is empty as well. Show it to the audience so they can see unequivocally that it is empty. Now let's just spin it a few times and get the molecules going and say a few words to set our spell in motion. [speaking spell language] Okay, Clifford. Is the hat empty still? - Yes. - You're sure there is no rabbit in there? - No. But if I were to pull a rabbit out of this hat, would you be impressed? - Sure. - No, you wouldn't. Nobody would be impressed. They would just leave the theater and say, "This is just another boring trick by a boring magician." But if I were to make you disappear into thin air, that would be a little more impressive, would it not? - Sure. [speaks spell language] Where's Clifford? [audience applauds] Where is he? Lucy, Dean, come on, help me find him. - Clifford! - Call out his name, please. - Clifford? - Look in the audience. - Clifford? - Do you see him? - No. - Are you sure? Wait.

Hang on. - How do you know him? - That was absolutely amazing. Amazing. - Oh, did you like the show? - I loved the show. In fact, I've got to meet the magician. Can I go backstage? - I doubt it. - Can I get a card? Does he have a card? - No, he doesn't have a card. - I've absolutely got to meet him. How can I do that? - Good luck, man. Did you see the show? It was spectacular. I still got it! - You don't love me. - Why would you say that? If you did, you would listen to me. This is not about love. The show will be a big success now. I don't care about the show. I care about you. If you care, then let me have this. You married a magician. - I'm leaving. - Where are you going? I told you. Paris. Paris? Are you crazy? There's nothing for you there! You see! Look at yourself! - Look at what? - It's happening again. You have no idea how alive I felt tonight! I haven't felt this alive in years! - It's going to change you. - Let it change me. It's better than feeling dead inside. - You're a stupid old man. - You're not so young yourself. Me? I can still find someone. Go ahead. What do I care? I'll find a nice man who can actually maintain an erection! Oh, shut up! - I don't like furniture, but I do know this. I want a basketball goal up there, and I want a ping-pong table in the back. - What are you, 12? - Well that's just what I want. I know it seems a little bit childish, but I like the idea of shooting hoops in my living room. - Listen, we should go, right? - Wait, wait, you're not going anywhere until you tell us about what happened at that magic show. What the hell was that? - I know, babe. They made you disappear. - Apparently. - Well what did it feel like? - Well It didn't feel like anything, actually. I was in the seat and then I was in the box. - So It was instantaneous, like you fell asleep and just woke up? - Like you were blacking out, blacked out? - Exactly. Absolutely nothing, bam. - Yo, what the fuck? - Hi. - I thought you said South Side! - This is the South Side. - No, this is North Side, that's South Side! This is my boyfriend, Ralphie. - Hello. - Hello. - How's it going? - The show was amazing tonight. You should've seen it. - Yeah, I'll check it out sometime. - Yeah. - You know I had a magic kit when I was in 2nd grade? It was crappy. I burned it. You're in the show? - Me? No, I'm not in the show. I manage the theater. - Oh, you manage the theater. Did you have to go to college for that? - Oh, I majored in business. - Yeah, college is for fuck-heads. What about you, short stack? - Excuse me? - I mean, you're obviously in the show, like juggling daggers, riding a unicycle or something? - No. - Can you imagine? That would be some trippy shit, seeing him wobbling around on a little unicycle. What about the side geek show thing? You ever bit the head off a chicken? - Ralphie. - Nope. - I bit the head off this lizard once when I was in scout camp. My buddy Lester Phelps, he bet me five bucks I wouldn't do it. I fucking did it. I ripped the head off that motherfucker, spit it back in his face like it was a Snickers bar, pwah! Spit it right back in his face. - I'll bet. - Okay, we have to go. - Alright. See you dick-lickers later. - What a loser. - Yeah, that guy's a douchebag. - Uh, I haven't worked a job in a really long time. Um, my father died a couple years back and left me a lot of money and I pretty much live off of the interest, you know. - Yeah, I know. Jamie told me. - Jamie told you? - Yeah. - That's bullshit. That's not his information to tell. - It's not a big deal. - I'm not filthy rich or anything like that. I've just got just enough money that if I play my cards right, I can live the rest of my life on about $2,000 a week. After I pay my insurance and I pay my utilities and whatnot, I've just got enough money to watch movies and go to plays and go to Europe for the weekend, not that I really do that. If I had someone to do that with, maybe I would. - The bottom line is I don't work. I live off shit. I'm not ambitious either. I don't want to start a company. I don't want to be an artist. I don't want to do anything at all but enjoy my life. I just want to live a stress-free life. - I admire that. I don't see anything wrong with it. - I'm also on medication. - Okay. - I've been told I'm not mentally healthy. I won't foam at the mouth, you know, I wouldn't try to bite you or anything, unless you wanted me to. Here's the thing, I need it. - So do a lot of people. - That doesn't scare you? - No. I think I should probably be on something but I don't have health insurance, so I can't afford it. - All right, one more confession now. - Okay. - This is a big one, but it's true, and I feel this way, and I'm never going to not feel this way. But I don't ever want to have kids, ever. - Really? - Yes. No kids, ever. The thought of it is... you know. - I'm curious why you're so against it. - Magdalena, where are you? - It's very simple really. Sovereignty. - Sovereignty? - Yeah, I just want to preserve my freedom, my individuality. I want to be in a relationship. I'd like to grow old with someone, but I just don't want to do anything I don't want to do, and I don't want to have kids. Period. What do you think of that? - Well I have a confession to make, too. - [speaking spell language] - It's my uterus. - What's wrong with your uterus? - All sorts of crazy things. - You really can't have kids, really? - I really can't have kids, never. - That's wonderful, actually. - Wonderful? Really? - Not wonderful for you. I don't mean it like that. But I think this is good, maybe. It's... you know. It's good. - How? - Maybe we're meant for each other in some way. - Meant for each other? - Maybe temporarily at least.

Didn't I mention that already? - Well look, I'm a lawyer, too. You can't try to hoodwink me. - What kind of law do you practice? - Divorce law back in the day, so I know a thing or two about how the legal system works. - Ah, see, real estate law is a totally different beast, especially in New York City. We will be taking this to court and if we win-- - When we win. - The City will be forced to buy the building back from you for what you paid for it. - All right, but I paid next to nothing for this building. - Exactly. - I want to have a baby. I deserve one. - Of course you do.

You ever see the movie? - I don't think they made a movie about this book. - Yeah, they did. Claude Rains in the '30s. It's a classic. The special effects are way ahead of their times. Pretty creepy. - You know, that's something different, actually. This book and that movie, they're not related. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. This was written in the '50s, but it's also a classic. - Yeah, but it was written in the '50s, so it's probably a book adaptation of the movie. They do that sometimes. The movie comes out and then they write a book based on the movie, like they did for "Friday the 13th Part Six." - There's a Six? Oh. - You like slasher films? - No... No, but I've read a Stephen King book once. - Oh yeah, Stephen King. I'd seen that one movie that one time, "Misery"? With that fat bitch that kidnapped James Caan and ties him to a chair, breaks his fucking feet with a hammer. - Jeez. - That shit is crazy!

It's just a term that people use when they disapprove of something, like racism. - What does that mean? - Did you hear about those two black guys that were in a coffee shop but they didn't order any coffee? - Of course. They got arrested. - Right. The manager said you got to order something or else you have to leave, and they refused. So the manager called the cops and they were arrested for trespassing. - Now, black people started protesting and said it was about race, but it wasn't about race. If they had ordered one cup of coffee, they could've stayed. It's the principle of capitalism. If you want to sit down somewhere, you got to pay. If it was racist, they wouldn't have been allowed to enter the coffee shop in the first place. - We're not talking about sitting down and having a cup of coffee. We're talking about people's homes! - You've been raising the rent on us every year. This 30% increase is going to drive everybody out! - Well it's the same principle, though. If you can pay, you can stay, and if you can't, you got to leave. - That's racist. - Listen, I hate to break it to you guys, but Jane Jacobs is dead. If I had my way, I'd privatize every last square inch of public space in this city. I'd turn Central Park into a parking lot. I believe in complete laissez faire capitalism. 100% no exceptions. - Well I guess that's that, then. - Well thanks for the meatloaf. By the way, it's nothing personal. I mean, I'm not racist. I've had sex with a lot of black girls. [gasps] - What? - Thanks for the meatloaf. - Goodbye! - So you're broke. - What? What's that? How am I broke? - You've been spending money like the Queen of Versailles and not investing your money wisely. - I haven't been investing my money at all, Terry. - Actually, you have. - No, I haven't been. I've told you I wanted to have all the money in a bank account. I'm living off the interest for perpetuity. We talked about this. - The new SCC rules state that you can't just leave your money sitting in a bank account. You have to invest it. It's the Friedman Act. I told you this last year. - No, you didn't. - Yes. Unless I forgot to tell you. - What are you saying? I don't get this. What are you trying to say? - I invested all your money. - In what? - In big box stores. Sears, Kmart, a company called Bamazon. - Bamazon? What the fuck is Bamazon? - Big box store, Bamazon.

Now, listen to me here, just man to man, okay? I don't know anything about coding or languages or any X code or whatever, hyperlink language and stuff like that. I dabbled with HTML for a while.

I've got a baby on the way, and I really need a job. Here's the thing you got to think about, man. Our kind, we're under threat. - Our kind? - Yeah. You know, men. Culturally we're under assault. And especially white guys. It's like everyone hates us now because they're blaming us for all the problems, because we've been in power for so long and the world's fucked up.

Ronald Reagan white. Republican white, completely. Not David Duke white, but white enough to get the job done, you know what I'm saying? - "White enough to get the job done"? - Yeah, of course, but look, I can also go the other way, too. You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? - No. - I can be Arab. I can be Mexican. I can be whatever you want. I can be on one side of the spectrum, I can be on the other side of the spectrum. If you need to hire a white guy, which you should, because white guys need to stick together, do it. Hire me and I'll be white. If you need to hire more minorities, I'm your man for that, too, and I can be whatever. I could be Akbar, I could be Chico. The bottom line is I need a job, man. I mean, you know. - [sighs] - We have enough money left to keep the show going for another six weeks. - Six weeks? - Yeah. - Shit. - Listen, there are options. We can...
