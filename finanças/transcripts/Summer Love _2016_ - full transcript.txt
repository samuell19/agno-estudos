[♪♪♪] ♪ Like the perfect summer sunset ♪ ♪ Like a song that changed my life... ♪ "You never know when you're making a memory." That's a quote from one of my favorite philosophers, Miss Ricki Lee Jones. Ricki Lee who? Singer/Songwriter. Slightly before your time. But she's right! You gotta pay attention or your life can just pass you by. ♪ ...losing all I ever wanted... ♪ Kind of like this scenery. It's about a hundred times more interesting than anything on your phone. How do you do that? Put it away, sweetheart. But there's no devices at camp all summer. I mean, just think about all the wonderful adventures you're going to have. I'm trying not to think about that. Oh, Addison. You're not going to cry, are you? [Laughs] Cry! You're gonna cry. [Under her breath]: Yeah. [Maya]: Now, remember, I'll be in my internship program during the day, but you can always get a hold of me if you need to. [Addison]: I know, mom. Not with my mobile, though. I wonder if they'll have morse code. [Maya]: Very funny. [♪♪♪] Mom? Yeah? Is everything all right? Yes. Yes, my girl. I'm fine. Sometimes, I just can't help but think about all the things you missed out on, you know, since your dad's... Mom? You're an awesome mother, and a great dad, too. Come here. [Voice breaking]: I'm going to miss you so much. All right, let's see what we got. [Sighing] I signed you up for... Paddle boats, horseback riding, archery, hiking... Did you have to? Yes. Addison? You're in cabin 12. Uh, Mrs. Sulliway, the office just needs to know if you want to pay your remaining balance now, or when you pick Addison up? I'll do that when I pick her up. We're on the extended payment plan. Of course. Okay then. Let me know if you need anything, Addison. How about a ride back to civilization? You're funny. You should sign up for comedy night. Right. One more thing. Seriously? Yes! There's no email, and you have to record those memories somehow. [Microphone squeals] [Camp director]: Welcome, campers! Please report to the lodge for orientation and your safety briefing. I guess that's me. Oh! I just know you're going to have a wonderful adventure this summer. Okay? If I survive. I love you! Write me! [♪♪♪] Bill... Bill. "Free medium pizza when you order a large." That's more like it. [Sighing] [Sighing] A student's work is never done. [♪♪♪] Cannot believe I'm doing homework again at my age. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry. It's not even noon and I've already been "ma'am" ed. [Instructor]: Does everyone have an internship assignment? Mm-hmm? Now, these are your most important assignments for the year, so I want everyone to focus. Yes. Sorry I'm late. What was it this time? Another spelunking crisis? [Laughs] No, I don't think those kids will ever go in a cave again. [Laughs] You certainly have stories, Maya. Two weeks ago, your rigging got caught on a rock wall. That wasn't fun. I hung upside down for almost two hours. And today? Traffic. [Sighing] As I was saying... These internships count for half your mark. You must get the hr department to sign off. No signature, no internship. No internship, no class credit. No class credit... well, you can see where this is going, and it is a trail of broken dreams. "Kizzmit group?" What? Seriously? Maya? Yeah, why her? Why... wait. Why not me? [Ben]: Do you even know what it is? No. It's the parent tech company of talker. Oh, talk... er. Yes, that is that social app that everyone is using. - Eleanor? - Yeah. I think that maybe one of these kids might be a better fit. You all need to learn what you're capable of. That will happen at Kizzmit, unless, tragically, it doesn't. She has no idea what she's getting into. It's a total stress-inducer! And, um, what if she has heart failure or something? She's old. I'm 35, not 95. And I'm very physically fit. It's just they're really high-tech there, and you're not high-tech. No offense. None taken. And everyone there's really young and smart and cool. No offense. Little offended. Chloe, please. Kizzmit is tough, and they're hard on their interns. But if they like you, you're hired, you're golden. Well, not you, but somebody who's right for it. No offense. Do you know what "no offense" means? [Eleanor]: Any questions? Hmm? Great! Let's get started! That's amazing! So you know Kizzmit? Well, no, but... You said it was amazing, and I'm just feeding off your excitement. It's more terror than excitement, but I can see how they'd look the same, you know? Oh, a slick website. Click on the video. [♪♪♪] [Chantal]: Oh, my gosh. I know, right? Everyone is so young. How am I ever gonna fit in there? Well, you could borrow some of Addison's clothes. Not a bad idea. No. You know what? Come on. You are totally gonna fit in there. You are going to do great. I just feel like I haven't even really worked in so long. I mean, except for here, and this is mostly just us playing with climbing equipment and ordering Sushi. So. Yeah. I think... I think we're good. We're good. Listen. You have summitted Whitney with nothing more than good rope and a positive attitude. I did. I did do that. You did. You got everything you need. You're gonna nail this. Yeah? You went from adventurer to accountant. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Phone ringing] Hi! Hey there. I'm here for the internship. If you need an intern, you're gonna have to go through h.R. I am the intern. [Chuckles] You know what I love about that? It's that I've only worked here for, like, a minute and I already have seniority over you. [Chuckling] That's great. [Footsteps] Follow me. [Door buzzes open] Does anyone here talk? Shh. This is the cafeteria. Everything's organic, artisanal, gluten-free, paleo. Looks just like real food. That's funny. Just hang out here. They'll come get you for orientation. [♪♪♪] Hi. I'm Maya. Hey. Josh. Uh, Web Dev and A.I. Hey. Ricky. U.I., U.X. I'm Kayla. I'm in marketing. Nice top! Oh. Well, thank you. I understand everything you just said. Oh. Accounting. Intern. Oh. This place is tope, huh? "Tope..." Aren't you a little mature to be an intern? Define "mature". Hi, guys! I am Polly. I'm covering orientation. First, let me start by saying how super-lucky you all are to be here. Some of you will be jumping into different departments. Some of you will be assigned. You might be working with project managers, getting lattes, making dinner reservations. Maya Sulliway, you're in accounting with Colin, our C.F.O. Ooh... I hear he's tough. Yeah, and a real control freak. Up the stairs. Through the glass doors, there's a retinal scanner. Josh Moss? Yeah. Social media. Kayla Nelson. Marketing. Great! That's it for now. [♪♪♪] [Scanner buzzing] [Buzzing] [Buzzes twice] [Buzzes repeatedly] [Buzzing] Maybe try going left a little. [Buzzes] It's just not... I don't get it. Move in. Okay. Now back... A little... A little closer. [Buzzes] It's just not working. Maybe because it's the key card reader. You were messing with me. Yes, I was. Retinal scanner's over there. I thought that was the thermostat. That happens to the best of us. It's never happened before, has it? No. Shall we? [Door lock disengages] So, you're new here. I'm an intern for the C.F.O. Oh. I wouldn't have guessed. Right, because I'm mature, but hey, you get it. You're old... Er, than me? No? Maybe. I was going to say because you seem more professional than most interns. [Chuckles] Thank you. I hear the person I'm working for is a real control freak. Really? Because I hear he's very good at opening doors. You're the C.F.O. I am indeed. After you. Shall we? Thank you. Mm-hmm. I'm Maya Sulliway. I'm Colin Fitzgerald. Very nice to meet you, even if it was a bit unusual. I get that. Please. What I would say, if I could start over, is that I'm very grateful for this opportunity, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun. Well, that depends on your definition of "fun." We do have a lot of account balances, spreadsheets, payroll. It's actually kind of boring. Well, I don't mind boring. And I'm as good at spreadsheets as anyone. Are you the Mary poppins of accounting? Well, considering the age of some of your employees, I think that might come in handy. Hey, man! Check this out. This was flown in from an exclusive resort in Thailand. All right? Black ivory coffee. Their specialty blend is from beans that have been digested and then naturally refined by thai elephants. Elephant dung coffee? It's better when you say it that way. How is it? [Gulps] I can barely drink the stuff. [Stifles laugh] Sorry. Maya, this is our C.E.O. And sometime coffee purveyor, will Martin. Will, this is Maya Sulliway, my new intern. Hi. Intern? Really? Why? Class credit. You're still in school? Not for 16 straight years. I did take some time off. Oh, I get it. That's cool. Take your own path. Right? I mean, take me, for instance. I dropped out of three different colleges, and now I have five honorary degrees. And here I am, just trying to get one real degree. I did not mean that the way it sounded. Never apologize for speaking the truth. [♪♪♪] Well, this has been fun. Some of us have some work to do, so. That sounds boring. I'm going to show Maya a few things. Come on. Um, is... that okay? Sorry, I don't... I'm not sure... [♪♪♪] After a couple years of meetings, we got our first major investor, and then things started taking off. We built Kizzmit in nine months. It cost a fortune, but we were growing so fast and had no choice. This place is amazing! Yeah, it's pretty spectacular. These steps are kind of tricky. Here. I don't know how you have time to give your interns this tour. Oh, I don't usually. I just do it for the ones that I know will appreciate it. Look, Maya, I don't really know you, but you seem to have that "get it" factor. What does that mean? You see things differently. Because of your experience. You mean my age? Legally I'm not allowed to ask. I don't care. Okay. So what do you think? I think it's a great empty lot. It's my favorite spot on campus. Because... Because it has potential. See, that's the key, Maya. Seeing value in things before anyone else does. So what do you see? Ducks. Yeah, I want to make a duck pond, where people can come and sit and... Reflect. Ducks are good. Yeah. They are. I like that you get that. We should probably head out of here. So, thank you again for the tour, but do you think you could just tell me where Colin's office is? I should probably get back. Oh! I did. Colin's office is right down that hallway, and this is where you live, Maya. Whoa. You're will Martin. Yes. I am. What's shaking, everybody? We were just talking about "pitch-fest". What's that? Oh, it's just a little contest we have every year. Anyone and everyone is encouraged to participate. Best new app wins. It's a big deal. Like, really big. Winning can set you up for life. [Phone chimes] I gotta take this, but I am looking forward to hearing everyone's pitches. Especially yours, Maya. [Scoffs bitterly] [Mutters]: I am so in over my head. [Crickets chirping] So then, not only did I insult the C.F.O., I managed to disparage the C.E.O.'S honorary degrees, and I'm pretty certain I alienated the rest of the intern pool. Wow. That's all on the first day? Pretty epic, right? Mm. At least will was really nice. Will? As in will Martin? Yeah. The C.E.O. Guy. He's so much nicer than I thought that he would be. What? You're crushing. I am not. Yeah. Whenever you get all formal, and you stop using contractions, I know that something is up. I do not know what you are talking about. Yeah, sure. Okay, so what did will do that makes him so nice? He took me on a tour of the Kizzmit campus. Showed me all of his favorite spots. Just the two of you? Yes. You really have no radar! What for? I mean, really, I was born, I grew up, I went to college, I dropped out of college, I met Nate, I married Nate. No radar needed. Well, maybe it's time for you to get back out there. Out... out there there? Mm-hmm. Oh, no. No. I have no interest in going there. I have school to finish, a career to begin, a daughter to raise. Absolutely not. I do not have time for a relationship. Maya, honey... Look, I know Nate is a hard act to follow... He was a bona fide hero for saving those climbers, he was. But... Maybe there's someone else out there who's right for you, too. I think you're right. Really? So you'll consider it? Getting back out there? No. That Nate's a hard act to follow. Hmm. [♪♪♪] Oh. You're still working. There's a barbecue outside. I'll be there soon. I just want to get through a little more of this first. [♪♪♪] [Bustling chatter, background music] [♪♪♪] Yo, team! What's up? [Employees cheering] We're getting closer and closer to launching talker 2.0, and I've been getting a lot of questions lately that pertain to whether or not talker can maintain its stronghold in the market, and I'm here to say, "yes, we can!" [Employees]: Yes, we can! [Will]: In a few short weeks, we're gonna have pitch-fest. Now, every single employee, including the interns, are encouraged to participate. The winner gets a 10-k bonus and a 20% equity in the new enterprise. So keep those ideas coming! [Cheering and applause] [Party music and chatter resume] So are you gonna throw your hat in the ring for pitch-fest? Me? [Chuckles] No. Not really my thing. Well, you never know where the next great idea will come from. I'm studying accounting, so unless I can come up with a new way to do math, I don't think it's gonna be from me. Well, who says accountants can't be creative? The I.R.S. Right. [Chuckles] [Phone chimes] Sorry, I have to take this. It's the best barbecue in the country. I had it flown in from Texas. So you're saying pigs do fly. [Chuckles] Is it too extravagant? It is expensive. That's from a soon-to-be- accountant's point of view. [♪♪♪] She's working overtime. She sure is! That wasn't a compliment, Ricky. See, I don't get nuance. [Josh]: What about the first day? That private tour with will? Yeah. And what is it with this whole sweet, Doe-eyed, outdoorsy bit? She's probably a lot more shrewd than she lets on. Hey, listen, don't be upset with me, but I looked at your personnel file. It's your company. I didn't realize you were married to Nate Sulliway. You knew him? I knew of him. He was a great climber. I'm actually a climber as well. You and I have a lot in common. We should maybe go to dinner tonight. That was a leap. Sorry. Yeah. Sometimes, my brain does that. [Chuckles] So, what do you say? Dinner? Uh, I appreciate it, but no. Why not? Well, um... For one, I am an intern at your company, so aren't there rules about that? My company, my rules. And who says it has to be a date? It could just be me taking a promising colleague to dinner. Even though you just elevated me from intern to colleague, I'm afraid it's still a no. You don't get turned down very often, do you? It's a new experience for me. [Chuckles] Something I'll have to get used to, though, I suppose. [Laughs] [Background music playing] [Pub music filtering into street] [♪♪♪] Hi, you guys. Listen, I think that you have the wrong idea about me, and I would just like to clear the air. You mean about you hanging out with will? Yes. I am not kissing up to our boss. I have no intention of entering this pitch-fest, and I'm not your competition. I never really thought you were. Thank you. Girls against boys? Absolutely. All right. Hey, Barry, wait up. [Phone rings] [Phone rings] Yes, Maya? Hey, Polly. Look, I'm out by the sculpture garden, and I cannot find building "C". I need to bring some more files to Colin. [Sighs] Take a left at the fitness center and go past the juice trucks. Got it. [♪♪♪] The investors are breathing down our necks. What am I supposed to tell them? Well, just stall them, like you did with talker. Okay, that was then, and that was further along in its development. Programming says they still need six months. I am working as fast as I can. Yes, you're throwing great barbecues and chasing interns. Look. I need a working version of 2.0 now. Or I need the next great "Will Martin" idea. You don't understand. You're not the creative here. There is a process. It takes time. It comes when it comes. Well, if we don't deliver something new, as promised, then we will lose the financing, and then this whole thing is sunk. So, you... Maya. Hi. [Awkward chuckle] How long have you been standing there? Not long. Did you hear anything? Not really, no. A little... The last part. But I have no idea what you guys are fighting... Uh, t-talking about. Okay. Well, what you did not hear, you can't discuss with anyone. Of course. I would never. I mean, it's fine. You did sign a confidentiality agreement when you started? I think so. Although, that first day, I think I did try to activate a card reader with my eyeball, so... I'm just going to give you these. - Okay, bye. - Thanks. Do you think she's gonna tell anyone? No. I trust her. Will... [♪♪♪] Yeah! Hey. Oh, hey, Josh. Just chillin'? Trying to. Long day today. Yeah, you look like you've just run a marathon. And lost. Yeah, Colin had me running errands all over the campus, and then I went on the Kizzmit tram, and then all the way back into the city. I just wish that there was some magical app that could help me run errands. There are lots of them. Actually, "errand rabbit" will hire someone for you. And that's great, until you are, in fact, the rabbit. [Chuckles] I wish that I had something that was more than a map. Something that could show you when the store's open, their peak hours, where to park, the fastest footpaths. Based on foot-traffic patterns. Exactly. Mashed all together. What's the upside? Saving time. I mean, if I had run those errands in a different order, I probably could have saved an hour. Just today? Every day. Huh. Cool idea. Thank you, Josh. [Phone rings] Mm. Hey, Colin. Your USB? Um... Yes. No. But I don't think that I have it. I'll check, of course. [Rummaging in bag] Let's see. I do... have it. Yes. I am so sorry. I must've picked it up when I was packing up to go. If you text me your address, I can bring it to your house, though. Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye. See ya. Have fun! [Chuckles] [♪♪♪] I am so sorry! I don't even remember picking this up. They should make these a little bigger. I will look into that. You know, I could have brought it to your house. You did. I live here. You live on a boat? I do. It's right over there. Actually, do you mind coming down with me for a minute? I just need to check this on my laptop. Sure. Come on. Thank you for bringing this. I have a bunch of work I need to finish up tonight. Doesn't sound like much fun. Well, it's not. But that's my life as a C.F.O. What do you do for fun? Uh, hang out with my daughter. Study, read textbooks till I fall asleep. You know, I never would've pegged you as the kind of guy who lives on a boat. Oh! What did you have me pegged as? Maybe just a slightly squarer peg? Well, I should probably work on that. And here we are. You have a custom Jefferson? How is it you know about sailboats? My late-husband, but that's another story. I'm sorry. It's okay. He would've loved this. [♪♪♪] So how long have you had her? Ever since I've been at Kizzmit. It was the first thing I bought after talker hit, and I've been restoring her ever since. Well, you did a beautiful job. Did you grow up around boats? Nope. Not at all. Land-locked in the midwest. I had a single mom, she got me hooked on reading and bought me all the Horatio hornblower books. Then after I read them, all I ever wanted was to own a boat and sail the world. Did you? Not yet. I haven't... Found the time or... the right person. I thought I did, once, but... I was wrong. Well, don't give up. It's an amazing boat. I'm sure you're gonna make a lot of great memories on it. [♪♪♪] I should go. Right. I didn't mean to keep you. Are you kidding me? And thanks. Thanks again. Thank you. It's not every day you get to see a boat like this. [♪♪♪] [Addison]: Dear mom, I think this is the first and last time I will ever be going to camp. The bugs are gigantic, there was a lizard in my bed, and the frogs keep me up all night. I can't wait to come home and start making other memories. These, I'd like to forget. Your loving and miserable daughter, Addison. [♪♪♪] You sure you're still not mad at me? We're good. As long as you stick to your promise and focus on 2.0. I will. Right after the game. Isn't the tennis court the other way? It is. I'm just making a quick stop first. Won't take long. I'm just glad this internship is only six weeks, because otherwise I would really be broke. Well, I can lend you some money, or an advance... Whatever you want to call it. You're already over-paying me for part-time work, but I appreciate the offer. [Chuckles] Well, you know, you never know when a prince charming is gonna waltz through the door and come to the rescue. More in the market for, like, a fairy-godmother, maybe a genie. Hello, ladies. [Gasps] What are we doing here? [Will]: As you can see, my friend and I are on our way to play some tennis, but we realize that we are in need of some tennis balls. No, we are not. We have a trunk full of them. Good, 'cause we don't sell them. Uh, can I interest you gentlemen in a climbing harness? Or a carabiner? 'Cause they're... They're on special this week. I'm sure my friend would love to see them. Great! Um... They're just over here. Hi. Listen. I just wanted to come here and apologize for putting you in an awkward situation when I asked you out at work the other day. Thank you. [Hushed]: This isn't awkward for you? No, of course not. We're surrounded by friends, which is why I felt like I should come here and ask you again. Why me? I have a feeling about you. You're genuine. Go for it, Maya! Break out of your comfort zone. Maybe she likes her comfort zone. Whose side are you on? What do you say, Maya? I mean, we can do whatever you want. We could just have dinner, or we could go for a hike, or rock-climb, or kayak, or paddle-boarding... Rock-climbing. Let's just go rock-climbing. Not as a date. Just as two people who like to climb rocks at the same time. I'll take that. How's tomorrow? [Chantal]: Tomorrow's great! It's a date. A non-date. [Hushed]: You had "a feeling"? It worked, didn't it? [♪♪♪] So? You still don't believe in prince charming? Huh? Ta-dah! [Laughing] [Mocks fanfare, then whimpers] All set? Absolutely. So you're not intimidated about climbing with the boss, are you? Should I be? All right. [♪♪♪] [Disbelieving chuckle] How are you not doing this professionally? It's insane! [♪♪♪] [Chuckles] Are you there? Yeah! I'm here! Is it too much? It's perfect! But it takes weeks to scale Everest. Well, not if you helicopter to second base camp. But that's cheating. [Laughs] You are tough, and I love it. First, you kill me at rock-climbing, and then I try to impress you by subtly dropping that I scaled Everest, and you won't cut me any slack. Well, I am impressed by all of this. Well, I'm glad to see that I'm making some progress. Do you always work this hard? Only when it's worth it. [Exhales deeply] This is some view. We should appreciate it while we still can. Why? Because of global warming or something? No. Developers. They're gonna make it into condos, golf courses. Can't say that I'm surprised. Mm, but it's just wrong on so many levels. Well, sometimes, you can't stop progress. But you can fight it. I volunteer with a conservancy group and we are trying to stop the building, you never know. Sometimes the good side wins. Well, if they're on your side, I'd say their chances are good. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Maya! Check this out. Josh has been working on a new app, and it's, uh, pretty cool. Oh, well, that's pretty. What is it? Uh, you try to get the ball through the maze before the penguins burst into flames. Oh, I love penguins! Yeah, uh, just play around with it. - Swipe. - 'Kay. [♪♪♪] All right. Are the penguins supposed to burst into flames that fast? Yeah, okay, but it's a perfect user interface. Okay. Well, I am a user and I am interfacing it with my face, and I don't get it. Maya, what's your take? I, um... You know, I like it. Yeah? Why? Mm. I'm not sure yet, but, you know... Uh... oh! There goes another penguin. Do you mind? [Game beeping and blipping] Yeah, it's a start, but it's far from perfect. I would try to widen your audience appeal. He didn't hate it. [♪♪♪] That's good, that's good. Yeah. It is good. - Thank you. - Will? Hi. Listen. I didn't mean to shoot down something that the other interns have been working on. Oh, no, it's a good catch. All right, look. The kid can be as enthusiastic as he wants, but simply put, the idea's not ready. Maybe you could've been nicer about it? No, absolutely not. Trust me. He's gonna have to learn from this, if he wants to survive in the tech world. That's just a fact. [♪♪♪] [Will]: All right, guys, keep it moving! If you're not sweating, you're not working. Make sure to maintain eye contact as you pass that ball back and forth. You're doing great. [Whistle blows] [Will applauds] All right, bring it in! Now that we've got the blood flowing, what do you say we toss down? Now, the one rule of team-building is that you have to start every question with "what if...?" I have an idea for an app. Better not be penguins. [Weak chuckle] No. Uh... What if you had an online planner... Josh, I hate to burst your bubble, but unless it has magical powers, I'm pretty sure we covered that in 2007. Uh, no, no magical powers. Anything else, Josh? We're all ears. Uh... There is one more idea I started kicking around, but it's-it's not fully-baked. Half-baked's okay for me. Uh, what if you had an app that would help you run errands more efficiently throughout the city? There are tons of those already. [Josh]: This one would have GPS, of course, but it would aggregate neighborhood maps, reviews of each place, parking spaces, foot-traffic patterns in real-time. It maps out multiple locations and puts them in order for you. Sean, my man, is this doable? Uh... Sure. A couple of coding revisions. The algorithm of looking for the map might take a little bit. Value proposition? Target audience? It could save you two hours per trip, and it would be used by moms, new parents, shoppers. It's a great idea, Josh. I want you meeting with the programmers. You're gonna be project manager of this starting Monday. Awesome. [Will]: That's how we do it around here. [Applauding] Great work. All right, let's get back at it! [Scattered applause continues] All right, let's go. So, humor me. I'm wondering how a guy in his twenties from queen Anne hill who's never lifted a finger in his life come up with an app to help struggling single moms run errands? TV? The Internet? Good imagination! Huh. Josh's other ideas so far have been an app to find hip bars, an app to find singles' bars, and an app to find hip singles' bars. I understand what you're saying. And I saw your face during his pitch. Josh? [Quietly balks] Can you come here for a sec? What's up? That was a great pitch. Just something I've been kicking around. [Colin]: Anything else you wanted to add? No, just... That's it. Maya? Yeah, actually, I would love to add something. Josh... I was really upset, because I wish that I'd come up with it myself. What? Really? It's a smart idea. Well, we were talking the other day you had just come in... I said it's a smart idea. Got it. Thanks. Anything else? That was nice, what you did. Hopefully, he learns his lesson. Don't know what you're talking about. You are both terrible liars. - Then why did you have us... - Because a good leader... ...is supposed to know which idea is worth fighting for and which person is worth fighting for. I think you're great at that. Wasn't talking about me. I mean, thank you, of course, but I'm just an intern. No. You shouldn't sell yourself short. Um... Hey, Maya. Did you get my text? We still on for tomorrow at noon? Yes. Yes, we are. It's still not a date. That's fine with me. And whatever you want to do is... Is great. So. Colin. Yup. Not a date. Yeah, of course. No problem. [Sighing] - So... - Yeah. You made it to the halfway mark. How's the internship going? It's a lot more like one of those reality shows, where people will do absolutely anything to win. I've just never been in such an intensely competitive environment. Hey, you're still standing. Yeah. Thanks to coffee... Sensible shoes, a little more coffee. There's just a lot to take in, you know? And, um... I'm not sure it's really a good fit. Maya... These internships were assigned to address your weaknesses, not play to your strengths. I know you've been dealt much tougher hands than this. Well, sure, but... I don't say this as your professor or your adviser, but as your friend. [♪♪♪] Oh, wow. I love wildflowers! How did you know? I didn't. They're not from me. Oh. Who's my competition? No competition. They're from Colin. Strictly business. Is he apologizing for working you too hard? Something like that. Well, he has a reputation for being tough on his interns. I'll just get my... Sure. Yeah. [♪♪♪] Guess I should've asked about the dress code. I thought I said casual. Yeah, I thought you meant "brunch" casual. Are you okay with this? Anything for a good cause. Thanks for being a good sport. Sure, but one day, I'd love to see what your idea of a real date is. Hey. Perfect. Thank you so much. [♪♪♪] [Phone ringing] Hello? Hi, mom. Sweetie! Hi! Is everything okay? Yeah. Great. I'm so happy to hear from you! But I thought that they didn't allow cell phones at camp. They don't. I'm using this thing called a "land line". [Snickers] How retro! Have you made any other new, exciting discoveries? I like horses. I'm actually a pretty good rider. [Voice breaking]: My very own Annie oakley! Who? You can look her up when you get your cell phone back. Hey. How's Chantal? And how's the intern thing? Good. And pretty good. But I miss you. A lot! I miss you, too. Did you get the postcards I sent? You can ignore the first two. [Counselor]: Okay, everyone, let's go! Oh, mom, I gotta go, okay? They're calling me for archery. I love you. Bye! Uh, Maya Sulliway? That's me. These are for you. [♪♪♪] Yes. Well, you'll be able to format the spreadsheet with the program I sent you. Mm-hmm. I gotta go. Thank you for the flowers. They're beautiful. Very large, but beautiful. Yesterday was a blast. And besides, what's a few wildflowers after planting a dozen trees? So did I pass the audition? I mean, two non-dates that went pretty well should transition to one real date, don't you think? I do. You do? [Laughs] I... I did not see that coming. Glad I could surprise you for once. Thanks for staying through lunch. You know, I could get in trouble for not giving you a break. I promise not to rat you out. I appreciate that. I'll even let you go home early for your loyalty. [Whispers]: I really don't mind the work. [Whispers]: Do you like it that much? [Laughing] It's better than going home to an empty house. My daughter's away at camp, so it's pretty lonely at home. Is that why you're usually the first one here in the morning, and the last one to leave? Well, that's not the whole story. I might not be quite as tech-savvy as some of other interns... All of the other interns... But that doesn't mean that I wouldn't love a shot at getting a job here full-time one day. Well, it's not just about being tech-savvy. I mean, anyone can learn those skills in a computer class. It's about thinking outside the box, taking risks... I'm more into just creating some stability right now. Is that why you chose accounting? Well, that, and I've always longed to push numbers in complete obscurity. And the real story? Always been good at math. Figured it would be good, steady work. Well... it is. Do you have any big dreams? [Laughs] Well, yeah. Well, I guess I used to. I used to dream of home-schooling my daughter. Taking her all around the world to places where I felt like we could really do some good. That doesn't sound so crazy. Yeah, but I mean, you need money to do that kind of thing. I think the bigger problem is that I'm just running all over the place, you know? I'm effectively working two jobs, finishing school, raising my daughter, running a household, trying to volunteer. There's just not enough hours in the day. I think a lot of people would agree with you on that one. But you're right. Sometimes, I think, if I counted the number of steps I took in any given day... And I did one time. My friends bought me a pedometer when I climbed mount Whitney, and, um... Mount whit... Are you okay? Yes. I'm fine. Would you mind if I took you up on your offer to let me leave a little early today? Yes. No, I mean, I don't... I don't mind. Great. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. [Knocks] Maya? Mm-hmm! Hey. I would've come sooner, but it's inventory today. So what's up? An app! Uh, okay, explain. I have an idea for one, I really think I could be on to something. I'm calling it "steps for good." I like it. Okay, so what's it do? It counts every single one of your footsteps when you run, hike, climb, from potentially millions of people, then it takes all that data puts them into a server, and then we use those numbers to raise money for charity. Mm. How? We get foundations to donate for every single step that you take. Maybe a cent, half a cent, quarter of a cent. It doesn't matter because it really adds up. Look at this. If you hiked the pacific crest trail, you would raise over $14,000. Maya, this looks amazing! I've run all these projections, it looks really good, but I think maybe I should get a professional opinion. Well, you could ask, I don't know... The guy who created talker? Colin's more the numbers guy. Okay, well, then take it to him. But he might think I'm trying to leverage my position. Then we're back with will. So our target audience is anyone who wants to run, climb, or hike, and also raise some money for charity while doing what they love. Revenue model? If we sell the app at $2.00, well, um... I'll just show you. Look at that. If we price the app at $2.00, then you'll see, at $3.00, it takes off. So do you think it could be worth submitting to pitch-fest? Because I... I wasn't going to, but if you thought... No. I wouldn't submit it. You're right. It's not ready. I was probably too ambitious. I don't know what I'm doing. Sorry I wasted your time. Stop. Breathe. I wouldn't submit it, because you need to keep this to yourself. Not because it's bad, because it's good. It's good? It's great! There's two reasons this can work. One, the idea is solid, and two, the creator of the app is passionate about it. I am! I am passionate about it! But if you submit it to the competition, then company will own the idea. You'll lose control, you'll make a sliver of the profits. I didn't know that. If you develop the idea yourself, then you can come back and sell it to us. Protect yourself and your participation. In fact, I'd like to ask for first right of refusal. [Laughs] Are you just saying this to be nice? No! No. I-i believe in you. You should believe in yourself, too. That's always been kind of tough for me. I don't understand that! You're one of the most amazing people I know. I mean... Look. Develop the app. Uh, make a demo, hire a lawyer, come back, and we'll buy it at fair market value. And... This conversation never happened. Of course! No one needs to know anything until you're ready. Of course. Of course! You know, I'm not used to anyone looking out for me. It's been a long time since someone did, so thank you. You deserve it. [♪♪♪] Thanks, Colin. [♪♪♪] Let's see what you've got. Mind if I join you guys? Yes. No. No. I'm confused. Aren't we mad at her because of the penguin game? No. Look, Maya could've thrown me under the bus in front of Colin back there, and she didn't. You know that app I pitched about running errands? Maya's idea. I was tanking in front of the great will Martin. I was desperate, so I "borrowed" her idea. That... that was yours? Water under the bridge. So I can like her again? [Laughs] Yes, Ricky. So, I have a proposition for you guys. I have an idea for an app, but I need help with programming, coding, and marketing. Well, why don't you just pitch it at pitch-fest? Because if we do, and it wins, then Kizzmit will own it, and I just think that this idea is too good, so if we collaborate, we could all be equity partners. Collaborating instead of competing? That is insane for this world. Sounds tope. What does "tope" mean? "Totally dope." That means good. So what's your idea? Okay. Here it is. [♪♪♪] So? It's... it's cool. Tracking the data in real time will be tricky, but I think I can figure that out. It has to be intuitive, so anyone can use it, right? Marketing it will be interesting, but it kind of markets itself. It could mean working nights and weekends. Oh, I'm good with that. I mean, my parents might actually believe I have a social life. [Others laughing] Cheers. Cheers. [Clinking] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Will grunts] [Grunting repeatedly] Good one. You were like a monster out there. Something bothering you? I'll tell you, but I don't think it'll make a difference one way or the other. If this is about 2.0, I told you, I'm handling it. It's not about work. It's about Maya. What about Maya? She's great. Funny. We have a good time. Which is true of every other girl you leave in your wake. In my wake? We both know how this goes. You swoop in, sweep them off their feet, and it's great while it lasts, and it usually lasts, what... Two, three weeks? And some women, they're fine with that, but I think you're totally wrong about Maya. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to remember when I asked you for relationship advice. Oh, wait... Never. She's my intern, so I think I have every right to be concerned. Oh. Are you sure she's not more than just an intern to you? I mean, I've seen the way you look at her, and you sound more jealous than concerned. I just don't want to see her get hurt. Well, why don't you stick to what you do best... Accounting? And stay out of my personal life. You guys have everything you need? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. All right. Let's do this. ♪ Feeling good in my brand-new shoes ♪ ♪ Happy day ♪ feeling good stepping to the beat ♪ ♪ Sunshine on my face ♪ I can't help but feel this way ♪ ♪ Baby, don't ever wanna change ♪ ♪ No, I won't change ♪ I'm feeling good ♪ blue skies on my mind ♪ blue skies on my mind ♪ yeah ♪ yeah ♪ I'm feeling good ♪ everything feels so good... I think it's ready. Maya, want to give it a try? ♪ Feeling good ♪ are you feeling good? ♪ Feeling good ♪ feeling good in these brand-new clothes ♪ ♪ A new haircut... [All gasping] Guys, we have our prototype! "Steps for good" is real! ♪ I can't help but feel this way ♪♪ So what'd I say? Best burgers in town or what? Amazing. I cannot believe I've never been here before. Colin and I actually discovered this place when we were first developing talker. Yeah, we'd come here, just get burgers and brainstorm. I was gonna ask how you guys got together. Oh, yeah. We were introduced to each other through this hedge fund guy that we both knew. Yeah, we've been a pretty good team ever since. Up until recently. Mm. I like Colin. I mean, he's... A really good boss. Mm. It's just kinda tough when you don't see the whole picture. I mean, don't get me wrong, Colin is pretty much a great guy, it's just that I don't think he really gets the way that I work and how I kind of operate. He's just so wrapped up in the numbers and trying to build this company, that I don't think he really cares... [Liquid spilling] Whoa! Whoa, whoa. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. Yes. Um... [laughs] Be right back. [Text alert chimes] [Chiming] Whoa. [Beep] [Chiming] [Footsteps] [Chuckles] I'm so clumsy. Should we get you another one? No. Let's not push our luck. So, pitch-fest. Mm! Are you pitching anything? Me? No. That's too bad. [Theme music plays] [♪♪♪] Good to see you. Hi. [Party buzzing with chatter] [♪♪♪] Hey, everyone! I'd like to, uh... Thank you all for joining us here at our annual summer pitch-fest! [Applauding and cheering] Why so glum, col? It's a beautiful day, and this is a beautiful crowd. For someone who's about to announce that we have nothing, you seem awfully sure of yourself. Who says that we have nothing? And without any further ado, I'd like to introduce our fearless leader, will Martin! [Applauding and cheering] All right! Psyched to be here! Talker... Launched a new way for people to connect, and now we're taking it to the next level. With its latest version almost ready for launch... [Investor]: When already? - Come on, how much longer? - What's up with that? Yeah! Ahem. To be honest, I may have jumped the gun on that a little. I was cautioned not to set expectations too high, but I thought we could deliver. The truth is, it's not ready yet. [Groaning and grumbling] But hang on, hang on! Who says we don't have something else in store? Now, our most recent offering is much closer to being launched, but it's a bit of a departure for us. The idea was created in our internal Incubator, and quite frankly, I didn't realize its full potential until a few days ago. We can do good and well at the same time. The program's called "steps for good." [Applause] [♪♪♪] - Maya? - I didn't tell him. Our target market is outdoor enthusiasts. The algorithm calculates the amount of steps taken on a run or hike, and then matches it with your charity of choice, dollar for dollar, step for step. We all love earnings, but we also love giving something back to those who are in need. So without further ado, I'd like to call onto the stage one of our very own summer interns, the creator of the app, Maya Sulliway! Get on up here, Maya. [Applause] Maya's just finding out that she won now. We wanted it to be a surprise for her. [Hushed]: What are you doing? We're celebrating a good idea. Just smile, say thank you. That's all you need to do. So I have one more announcement. In conjunction with the release of the new app, I have recently purchased a thousand acres of forested land that was in danger of being scooped up by developers. I've donated the acreage to the pacific northwest conservancy alliance, who has also decided to come onboard as our very first charity to join "steps for good." [Cheering and applause] All right, all right, all right, now that the business is over, it's time to party. [Applause] I swear to you guys, I did not give him our app. Then how did he get it? None of us gave it to him. I have no idea. The only people I ever even spoke to about it were my best friend, Chantal, and Colin. You just expect us to believe you? Either way, Maya, you betrayed us. It must have been Colin. I don't know what to say. Doesn't really matter. We're done. [♪♪♪] [Indistinct exchange] I need to talk to you right now. If you could just give me one minute. What are you doing? You stole my idea! "Steps for good" isn't yours. Well, you do work for me, so technically, anything you make is work product made for hire. I'm an unpaid intern! Look, most people would kill to have us make their ideas. I mean, do you honestly think you'd be able to do it on your own? I do. I did. With my team. Look. It's a good idea. And we're going to make it come alive, and your name is gonna be on it. How generous of you to put my name on my idea. You're gonna be compensated. I'm gonna talk to the investors, and make sure that they approve a point or two for you. All right, look, Maya, I'm sorry. I don't know why you're so upset. I'm, literally, I'm doing this for you. You did this for you. What about the forested area? That, in no way, makes up for what you did! When did Colin give it to you? I'm just confused, because, a few weeks ago, he told me that I should keep it to myself, develop it on my own. [Sighing] Colin told me to make an announcement today. Which I did. I told you, all he cares about is the business. [Huffs] In that case, I don't know why you said you weren't good partners, because I think you're perfect for each other. [♪♪♪] [Colin]: Maya! I don't understand. Why did you give it to will? You're a thief! I don't know what you're talking about. I quit. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] I can't decide who's worse... Colin or will. It's a toss-up. I guess guys like will Martin really are too good to be true. Certainly seems that way. Colin was just such a surprise to me, though. Are you sure quitting was the right thing to do, though? Doesn't that mean you don't get your class credit? I don't care. I just couldn't be there anymore. [♪♪♪] When were you going to tell me that one of your interns had an idea that could save the company? The idea wasn't ours, it was hers. So you told her to keep it from me? Well, you conned her into giving it to you anyway. She didn't give it to me. She didn't even know I had it. So Maya didn't submit "steps for good" to the competition? Then how did you get it? I took it from her phone. [Scoffs] That's pretty low. It wasn't my finest moment. Then it means she never signed the application or the waiver, and, legally, the idea isn't yours. And you are right back where you started. [Will]: Who cares? Legal will figure it out. [♪♪♪] Wait, wait, wait. Bring it over here. Wait, wait, wait. It's going to fall. It's going to tip. Oh, my goodness. Is that Addison Sulliway under there? Mom! My girl! Can you believe it? I came first place in the canoe race! Of course I can believe it. You're amazing. Should we canoe the cedar river? What do you think? That would be so much fun! You ready to go home? [Sighs deeply] I'm going to miss it here. There's always next year. Really? We'll try. Come on, let's get your stuff. How's Chantal? Great. And school? Not so great. And why's that? Well, the internship didn't quite work out, so I had to leave a little bit early. I wanted to leave camp early, but you told me to stick it out. Well, it's different. How? Okay, it's not completely different, but it's not a big deal, I'm just gonna repeat the class. But you worked so hard for this class! You're just going to give up? I don't know what I'm going to do. But you're not gonna worry about it. Come on. [♪♪♪] [Doorbell chimes] Can we come in? [♪♪♪] So what's up? We heard you quit, so we thought we'd bring you your stuff. Thank you. And we have something to tell you. Go ahead, Ricky. Um, well, I got to thinking about everything, and I never really believed you betrayed us, so I did some digging. I discovered how will got the app. But it was Colin. No, it wasn't. It was will. He got it from the text I sent you that had the working prototype. I-I don't understand. [Ricky]: Trust me. Now, I can't reveal how I managed to get into will's phone, but I did, and there it was. He got it from your phone. [Exhales deeply] Want me to go back into his phone and delete all his contacts? Maybe just mine. I just cannot believe I'm about to fail my class over this! Well, do you have to? [♪♪♪] Look, I understand. Seems like I stopped a little short of the finish line, but please, let me just show you something first. It's called "steps for good." Now, look. I made... This prototype. I ran budget specs. I assembled a team. My boss... I guess he's my former boss now, but he said that he thought it was a great idea. So I just don't think I deserve to completely fail your class. I'm sorry, Maya. I can't pass you if you didn't finish the internship. Why did you quit? It was personal. Didn't have much to do with the job. It had a little bit to do with the job. What aren't you telling me? It doesn't matter. Look. I do think that what's important is that I learned a lot, I worked really hard, and I made something that is really cool. I get that, and I really wish there was something more I could do for you, but I can't change the course requirements. I know. So... What do you say? I'll see you next semester. [♪♪♪] Colin? Maya. This is, uh... Uh, unexpected? Yes, to say the very least. Uh, what are you doing here? I signed off on your internship, and I wanted to bring in the paperwork myself, to make sure you passed the class. Thank you. That's just... That's really... That's really nice of you, after how awful I was to you, and I practically called you a thief. No, you actually did call me a thief. But that was will, that was not me. I followed your lead, I, uh... I... I quit Kizzmit. Why? Because I don't want to work with people like him anymore. And I wasn't happy there, and... You made me see that. I have no idea how I would've done that... You showed up. You have real integrity, Maya, and, um, I admire that. I want more of that in my life. So what are you gonna do now? I was hoping to find a new start-up. You know, something that... Something that matters, you know? Like, uh... Like "steps for good." Are you asking me for a job? I want to be your first investor. I-I do have some experience. I'm pretty good at it. It's risky! I don't think so. Not... Not when I believe in someone the way I believe in you. I don't know what to say. I knew, when I first saw you, that you were never going to belong there... But... I think that you might belong with me. Um... [Inhales deeply] So... What do you think of my pitch?
