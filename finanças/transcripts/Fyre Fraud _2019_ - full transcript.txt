EMILY: The townhouse was the big selling point, and that wasn't part of it anymore. At that time, Magnises needed quick cash. Memberships weren't selling. They kept trying to come up with ideas of what would sell, what would make this cooler. Billy started coming up with ideas that we thought seemed at least shady. Billy could get a lot of money quickly when he would try to sell tickets, 'cause he would sell things he knew people wanted even if he didn't actually have them. He tried to sell access to a private JLo party, and then he was saying he had exclusive tickets for Jay‐Z and Beyoncé. But, like, the worst ticket scam in my opinion was for "Hamilton." You could yell at him saying, like, "There's no possible way you have 200 tickets for 'Hamilton' one night. There's‐‐ It's absolutely impossible. And he would say, "It's possible." It would come to the night of, when people are like, "Where are my tickets? It's the night of the show." And he would, like, last minute buy them on, like, StubHub for insane prices and would give them out, like, literally in person. I could see clearly, like, Billy is gonna run this promotion, get a ton of money from "Hamilton," and then he'll pay off the Beyoncé tickets he sold earlier. And all the sudden he'd be like, "By the way, we're selling Super Bowl tickets." Because he had to pay for the Hamilton tickets.

CALVIN: By some accounts, she gets paid $250,000 per post. ‐ I think 250's a steal. ‐ To, like, post how many Instagrams? One? CALVIN: The point of Kendall's post was to announce that G. O. O. D.

Under a truncated time frame, if you had all the money in the world, it takes several months, if not years.

CALVIN: And so they didn't cancel the festival, but what happened is the story kept getting bigger. And then people I knew, you know, you know, started buying GA passes. But what I think Billy figured out very quickly was that he was not gonna be able to throw this festival with the number of people that were buying GA passes for the cost that he thought it was gonna be. And so ultimately, they just said, "Well, it's sold out, "so the only thing that you can buy now are the premium passes." ‐ So Grant designed these, like, villas. ♪ ♪ I think he just used AutoCAD.

I mean, it's like, "Why can't we Amazon Prime this or something?" [awkward music] JAKE: These guys were just selling villas because they needed another $25,000 to pay the production and stage guys. JAKE: In fact, very quickly after the festival, I acquired a trove of thousands of emails detailing the inner workings of the Fyre Festival. What they show is that right around this time, Billy is so short of cash and he's trying desperately to figure out how to pay everybody off that he begins engaging in criminal acts and wire fraud.

CALVIN: So I'm watching this thing unfold from afar, but what I didn't know was that the festival was basically just a big promotion for Billy and Ja's bigger idea, which was the Fyre app. CALVIN: The Fyre app is a booking app so you can rent out celebrities to appear at your events, and I think this was sort of the Tinder for booking talent. You'd swipe right and make an offer on Coldplay, and Coldplay would either accept and swipe right or swipe left on you, and then you guys would be linked and then, you know, you'd have them playing at Timmy's bar mitzvah. A very dear friend sent me a term sheet from Comcast Ventures to Fyre Media. It was for a significant amount of money‐‐ a really meaningful valuation. But he was just indicating that the app was far more profitable than it actually was. And that's really when it turned from something of rich millennials getting picked off to something that became, like, a significant financial crime. And so at this point, I have a thesis that this is a fraud. So I called Comcast Ventures, and I said, "Look, "you gotta trust me. It's not legitimate. "Just do me this favor. "Promise me that you won't write a check to this company until after the festival occurs." And to their credit, you know, they ultimately didn't invest. But still, more tickets are getting sold. And the more money people were spending on this thing, you know, the more I felt like, "Hey, someone has got to stand up and say, 'This isn't real.'" And so I created the anonymous Twitter account FyreFraud, and I just started posting what I knew to be factual. ♪ ♪ OREN: We would sit in meetings with the Fyre team, and we advised them to stay away from Twitter because there was, like, an account that basically called them out.

VICKIE: If you're a business partner in this and you have the information that this is gonna be a shitstorm, you should tell somebody. OREN: So there were a few vendors who dropped out.

VICKIE: If it were my agency and I didn't think that this was something I could put my name behind, I would've dropped out. OREN: There's so much momentum, so much money, so much force behind everything that it's like, "This train's not stopping." CALVIN: You can say in hindsight that this is very easily a fraud, but there's a point at which I questioned, like, "Am I wrong? Am I crazy?" I needed some of the validation that an actual journalist could provide, so I called "The Wall Street Journal," and I say, "Here's everything I know. You need to put a stop to this thing," because these guys were not running an honest operation. And they printed it in "The Wall Street Journal." Okay, I've done my civic duty. We have killed this thing. That's good enough for me. And I was wrong. They were unfazed. In fact, they were only emboldened. They hit back with a counterpunch of what can only be described as a social media blitz. Somebody would post a question on the thing. The question would immediately get deleted. ‐ Anytime there would be anything that was "distasteful" or calling Fyre out on anything. It was always a matter of, "Go to that source and eliminate it." ‐ If you're asked, as a media company, to start deleting things, you‐‐that's a red flag.
