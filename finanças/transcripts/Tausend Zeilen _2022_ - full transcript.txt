THIS MOVIE IS FICTIONAL. BUT A LOT OF IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. ALTHOUGH WE DID MAKE UP MOST OF IT. HONESTLY! My name is Juan Romero. I'm a freelance journalist and have a wife and four kids. Here's how my youngest daughter would describe my job: "Daddy's always away, and when he's home, he types things into his computer." I tried to explain that, as a reporter, you travel a lot, so you can tell people about what's going on in the world. She just looked at me, wide-eyed, and said, "You can look it all up on the internet." But the truth is a bit more complicated. I'm currently writing for CHRONIK, Europe's largest news magazine. The web bombards us with information - loud, in-your-face, free of charge. The CHRONIK still does proper research. Credibility is top priority here. Quality journalism is in crisis, though. Print sales and advertising revenue are plummeting. To make money with magazines, you need something special, like gripping, emotional exclusives. And the CHRONIK has just the man: Lars Bogenius. The new superstar in journalism. The CHRONIK's top dog - young, successful, popular. His nickname: Lovely Lars. We were just talking about you, Lars. And a decorated legend on top. We missed you at the editorial meeting. I know, I'm sorry. I had to look after my sister. Is she still not better? Afraid not. But I won't bore you... We heard you have a new story pitch. - Yes. Join us for lunch? These two adoring gentlemen are Head of Features Rainer Maria Habicht and Deputy Editor-in-Chief Christian Eichner. They've hit the jackpot with Lars Bogenius. He just writes the most awesome features, like the one on football player Colin Kaepernick. He became famous for protesting against racism in the U.S. by not standing for the national anthem and instead taking the knee. Lars Bogenius was the only journalist granted an interview with Kaepernick's adoptive parents. Bogenius also tracked down Maroof Atassi, who years ago wrote "You're next, Doctor" on a wall, aimed at Prime Minister Assad. Incredibly, the boy's graffiti triggered the war in Syria. And the world learned about it from Lars Bogenius, a reporter who writes about Aleppo's children, but also raises money for them in Germany. Brilliant at his job, with a moral compass. A dying breed. I'm calling it, this young man is our magazine's future. SOUTHERN MEXICO This is where I enter the frame. Se?or, are you free? Sure. Follow the refugees. Don't tell him we're journalists. We're journalists. - Great. It gets enough press, gringo. But if you insist... 90 dollars. - 10. Hey! - Are you crazy? 50 dollars. - Let's go. Blackmailing bastard. Rainer. - Romero. Would you consider staying in Mexico a little longer? Why not. Alright, now listen. We're gonna crank it up. This small refugee story you're working on, let's pump it up, let's go bigger. Is he totally insane? - What? The driver, doesn't matter. It does matter. Tell him I'm gonna puke. So we tell the story from two different perspectives. An American living near the border, member of a militia, Trump voter, obviously, hunting down illegals with his buddies, all to protect his beloved country. Shit! Exactly. Then, a woman from, let's say... Honduras? One of those corrupt shithole countries. - He's insane. Ideally a single mother traveling alone, carrying her little daughter, walking thousands of miles to reach the country of her dreams. Traffickers get her across the border, which is being defended by the U.S. militia... Rainer, if I understood you correctly, this all sounds very specific. Of course it does. You think we sit scratching our balls all day? Clear remit, clear results. We'll make it a cover story. What do you say? A cover story? Give me two days to find a woman, I'll then cross and look into the militia. This is gonna be big, Juan. You're collaborating with Bogenius on this. I can write it on my own. I'll fly to Phoenix... - He's coming back. Bogenius is in Arizona. Assholes! What? It's my story, let me write it, I can... I've no time for vanity, Romero. All I need is a good supplier. Silvia? - A supplier? Bogenius does the U.S. part and you do Mexico. So... Do we have a deal, or should I send someone else? Well... - Great stuff. It's gonna be awesome. I've worked my ass off for years and he makes me a supplier. Listen, Mr. Supplier, we'll be lucky to get out of this alive. Hello? Lars, my friend. Romero is doing Mexico. How are you getting on? Well, to be honest, it's really tough going. Those guys are extremely cautious. But I managed to find a contact. I'll scope out this border militia... "Border Wolves". They're pretty wild guys. Lars, you're doing an amazing job out there. I'm trying my best. Taking on this feature, in spite of the circumstances. Yes, it's unbearably hot here. No, I meant your sister... My sister? Oh, I didn't mean to... No, it's fine. Last weekend I... took her to the movies. It was so great to see her laugh again. It's those moments that give us strength, both of us. But, Mr. Habicht... - Hold on. Yes? My name's Rainer. Yes, I know. Please, call me Rainer. - Thank you. You're welcome. So when can you send the first drafts? Well, you know, Mr... Hold on. - Oh, yes... Rainer. We may have bitten off more than we can chew with this one. They're total extremists, fanatics, finger always on the trigger. You can't approach them easily. I'm not sure I can crack them. Lars, if anyone can, you can. This story's going to be massive. MEANWHILE 2,329 MILES FURTHER SOUTH I need to get out. Here we are, gentlemen. Right. Excuse me, please. I'm a journalist and would like to ask you some questions. No, thank you. I just want to talk. - No, no. Sorry, pardon me. - No, I'm sorry, my fault. Thank you. - Cute kid. Thank you. I'm a father of four. Lilly, Elsa... Pia and Jule. May I ask you a few questions? I'm a journalist from Germany. You journalists write whatever you want anyway. No idea why the cops turn up here every week. We abide by the law. What law? - The law. There's only one. - You mean yours? DEPUTY HEAD OF FEATURES Answer it, sister. It's just a friend. Your boyfriend? A friend. Friends are important. Can I call you back? From one half-breed to another, doesn't Habicht like me? Why wouldn't he? Why do I have to be Bogenius's supplier? I've been doing this ten years longer than him, I'm no rookie. - Can we talk later? But I could have... I could have done this job on my own. Of course, but Lars is just... Is your friend jealous? Let's just say he did it. Did what? He met those guys. Bogenius did? - Yes. He's with the militia? - Yes. I gotta go. How'd he manage that so quickly? Crazy, huh? What's even crazier, I got a text earlier. I have to go to Arizona to take photos for Bogenius. Lucky devil. Who's the lucky one? You get to jet back home, snuggle up to your wife and kids, and write your kickass Mexico part. You've got some great photos. - Asshole. I know. Go safe. - Sure. And I'll send you a link to a documentary. "Along the Border", great research material, check it out. Will do. Thanks. Have a good flight. He's coming, quick, hide! Hello? I made an extra big effort to get home on time, before my kids are off to school. Shush! That's the door. Arriba... Daddy! - My little monsters. Don't break him. Do we know her? - No! Good to have you back. - Yuck! Should we keep him? - Lucky me. Now off to school. But Pia is poorly, so Daddy will put her back to bed. Oh, my darling. I lost my shoe... She says he smells. Are we celebrating? - Yeah, your cover story. With Bogenius. I missed you. It's you who's always away. Not anymore. Really? - Yes. I don't even remember what you feel like. What are you two doing? Daddy desperately needs a shower. Yep. - Are you taking your new friend? Daddy will have a shower, you go back to the monster den. I don't want to. I'd never seen anything like it. They call them "jumping cholla cacti". They have these nasty little spikes, liked barbed hooks. If you go near them... What? So I'd prefer to stand for today's meeting. That's the kind of detail that lets readers feel the story. Dear Lars, thanks for your work and I look forward to the article. Now then, Dirk, how was your weekend with the Social Democrats? At the super-exciting party conference. Let me just remind you all. Everyone in this room writes features for the CHRONIK. We're the avant-garde of German journalism. We don't just inform, we mold reality into stories. We give readers a guiding hand and help them comprehend their reality, intellectually and emotionally. It's what makes us unique. We don't waste our time at party conferences. That's current affairs, it's got nothing to do with any of us. Leave it to the fact guys in Politics. Seriously, we're done with that stuff. Sorry. Thanks, Rainer, thank you. I'm sure you wonder why I'm interrupting such an important meeting. I just had a call from our publishers, informing me that the sales figures for our magazine... how should I put this? ...have bucked the general trend. And, even better, according to our research... Champagne? - I have green tea, thanks. ...our most popular articles are your features. Congrats. We owe this to - apart from the whole Features team - one young writer. Lars Bogenius. Thanks, I really appreciate it. But I'm only one of many. You're great colleagues, I could never have done it without you. All the talks we've had, the discussions... Like with you, Dirk. They've always helped me immensely. Dirk, I value the contribution of you and your team. Thanks a lot. So, dear colleagues, soon, this department will have even more sparkle. Right, let me explain what's happening right now. In a few weeks, Christian Eichner will be Editor-in-Chief. He made Rainer Maria Habicht his deputy, so Habicht will be Deputy Editor-in-Chief. Lars Bogenius will also get promoted. He'll be Head of Features, taking over from Rainer Maria Habicht. The only person completely in the dark about all this was me. I was putting my kids to bed. Arriba! Aren't you going to help Daddy? - No! I'm surrounded by monsters! Monsters! Hi Juan, hope you got back okay. I'm attaching a first draft, so you get an idea what the story might look like, what should go where and where the junctures are. I envisage the following structure: gringos - trek - gringos - trek - gringos - trek. So three parts in Mexico in total. Take a look. I think it could work. Regards, Lars. JAEGER'S FRONTIER / U.S. PART One night, while thousands of people trek across the Mexican plateau, carrying backpacks or small children, harboring good or bad intentions, northwards to the big frontier, 1,200 miles away, in Arizona, on a hill separating the Mexican desert from the United States, six men in military uniforms prepare for the invasion. Clad in ammunition belts, they await with automatic weapons and body armor. One of them goes by the name of Pain. He smokes cigars and wants to "kick the asses of the devils trying to invade the USA", echoing Donald Trump. Another is called Luger, after the gun. He flies a drone south, to monitor enemy movements. Three others - Spartan, Nailer and Ghost - have hoisted the American flag upside down, a symbol for the nation's state of emergency. Shit... Damn it... Yes? What? Who? I just received Bogenius's copy. So you call in the middle of the night? - Those guys are batshit crazy. Reads like a comic book. Were they messing with you? I've no idea. What do you mean? Can you send me your photos? I don't have any. Why not? I never went there. - Why not? Bogenius said they refused to be photographed. He didn't want to lose the story. So there's no photos, okay? Pretty annoying. So it was just him? - I guess. Any more questions? Alright then. I'm switching to flight mode. Good night. What a total... shit... Hey Lars, thanks for your email. Those guys sound insane. Let's talk later. In the meantime, here's my part of the story. JAEGER'S FRONTIER / MEXICAN PART BY JUAN ROMERO You wanted to see me? - Lars. Great. Come in. Come over here. Awesome view, right? It's very impressive. By the way... I've got a little surprise for you. We submitted your feature on that Syrian boy for the German Press Award. Wow, thanks, Rainer. Don't mention it. Just one more thing. Take a seat. That thing with Dirk yesterday... It didn't really go very well. But I think Dirk is... Excuse me. Dirk! Yes? - There are thousands of Dirks out there. There's them and there's us. You got to hire the best. Ditch the deadwood. Up here, you can't afford to be sentimental. I wanted to talk to you about that. I lay awake all night. I... I know it's a huge honor... I was delighted to be offered your position. And? It somehow doesn't feel right anymore. How do you mean? Rainer, I'm not sure I can deliver. Of course you can. You think so? - Definitely. Come on. Besides, I'm still here. If you have any problems, just come to me. The girls wanted to surprise you. That's sweet of them. GOOD MORNING DADDY WE LOVE YOU And I have something to discuss. You know I've been looking for a studio for my food blog? Homemade? It's just too cramped here. You know why. - Why? Because the kids run riot. - Sure. I finally found a space. I'm meeting the bank tomorrow about a loan. I've done the math and it could work. It'll be tight, but I think we can do it. I might have to blow the bank guy though. Read this. Juan, please straighten out your part, I can't do it all. We need a tighter narrative, factual character portraits, precise locations, more meaningful scenarios, we can't picture life along the trail. Your Mexican part just isn't ready yet. Why don't you emulate my style? JAEGER'S FRONTIER / U.S. PART BY LARS BOGENIUS Dawn breaks above Arizona. The sun starts to illuminate the desert. The men of Altar Valley slept out below the stars, hugging their rifles tight. While Spartan and Jaeger kept watch, all through the night. A few hundred times, Jaeger says, they've captured foreigners creeping up from the south at night and tied them up or fired warning shots to drive them away. They once caught a teenager from El Salvador, and his punishment was to run back through the desert, with no shoes or water. Another time, recounts Jaeger, near Brownsville, Texas, they made three Mexican women who had backpacks full of cocaine freeze in the mountains for two nights before handing them over to border police. Jaeger says he now knows what's what. He heard - not on Fox News, but on CNN - that, this year alone, 400,000 illegal migrants crossed the border, smuggling drugs worth 60 billion dollars into the country, and that last year, over 70,000 people died of a drug overdose. More than ever before. Jaeger calls what America is facing at this latitude... "A battle for survive." He's not sure if what lurks in the valley below is animal or human. Maybe he believes it's up to him to do what Trump's soldiers aren't allowed to. Maybe he refuses to believe Trump's words were just electioneering. The rifle rests on his shoulder. He has no target. Jaeger squints in the darkness. He cannot see. And eventually... Insane. He was there when they were shooting? Who knows what those guys are like? Extremists, deranged veterans... Come on, they won't let Milo take pictures, but Bogenius can watch them shoot at people? It's a great story. Dear Lars, thanks for your comments. First off, before I forget, my sincere congratulations. It usually takes weeks, if not months, to gain the trust of a militia and be able to accompany them. Hats off for achieving this in three days. But still, I have a few questions. What were their names? Nailer? Pain? Luger? Spartan? Ghost? Sound like wrestlers. You're sure they carry an arsenal like that in the desert, and act like a bunch of unhinged cowboys? They chase a tied-up, barefooted boy into the desert without any water? Don't the border police ask questions when some hillbillies hand over three women with bags of coke? Do they get internet in the desert? I mean, for watching Trump videos. Are you serious? They shot people before your very eyes? Don't you just hate smartasses? I mean, come on. Everything we write is rigorously checked. By our documentation department. The CHRONIK's fact-checking department is the world's largest. No other magazines bother anymore. Fact-checkers are a journalist's natural enemies. Their premise is not to believe anything us editors write. Documentation isn't even part of the content team. It's an independent department. This allows fact-checkers to evaluate our copy in a neutral and unbiased manner. Hey, I got you something. Immense joy. Thanks, buddy. He loves that sweet shit. How's your mom, still in intensive care? Yup, still there. Oh. Damn. And what about your sister? Slowly getting better. She's staying with me for now. Want one? Immense joy. Thanks, buddy. Documentation, Osterom. Hey, Romero. Yes, I checked it all, it wasn't that much. All facts are verified. Arizona's in the U.S. and has a border with Mexico and a desert. The Trump speech is quoted correctly and there's no other National Anthem. Anything that can be factually verified has been factually verified. How about what the guys claim about shooting? Nuts, isn't it? They shoot at people. He never writes that. I guess he's right. They fire their guns and the article suggests it's at people. I wasn't there, Romero. I need to trust the reporters on what they experienced. I can't just come along. You could suggest it to the boss, though. Okay, thanks. He did what? - It's okay, Juan's a brilliant colleague. I just happened to pass by Documentation and overheard... Don't get me wrong, I don't want to badmouth a colleague. I just heard Juan discussing my copy with the fact-checker. My writing. Behind your back? - Yes. How should I react? I respect Juan, but he can't just... - Absolutely not. No evidence, just probing... nagging. I'll take care of it. Thanks, Rainer. And Lars... In a few weeks' time, you decide who you want to work with. "Icke", the homeless magazine. Can I have a magazine? You got a message, Daddy. SEE LAYOUT ATTACHED I'll buy one. - Thank you. "Icke" magazine. - Ticket inspection. "Icke" anyone? Not him as well. - Sorry? The homeless magazine. - Could you pay? You won't get off that easy. - Can I call you back? Tickets, please. Can you wait a second? - No, I can't. You want me to get an appointment? Everyone is talking at me. I can't hear a word. This could get unpleasant. - Everyone out. Good idea. - Come on. Have you seen the layout? Yes, I have. I take it you have no ticket? ID, please. Daddy... - Wait. I'll cut to the chase. Trying to screw over Lars by calling Documentation... Sorry, Rainer, I wanted to straighten it out with Lars. There might be some errors. "Might be"? I need specifics. Daddy... Quiet! Daddy's on a call. No need to shout at the girl. What was that? Are all these your kids? - Yes. I would need to see your evidence. We need solid research. Kids under six travel free. Anyone over six moves up to the next tariff. How old are your three kids? - Four. Four years old? - Four kids. You can thank Lars for correcting your text. Well, I only see three kids here. Why does it have to be this neighborhood? That's why we're here, Mr. Karsunke. Let me show you why it's the perfect location for my business. The grassy patch over there, let me show you... we'll set up a permaculture garden. Ellie, the documents, please. - Yes. The location surrounded by old warehouses is perfect. We'll put the studio and the office on the first floor. Ellie, can you take this? Hello? - It's part of the premises. Oh, it's you. - We'll set up a studio for our blogs. Anne? - In a minute. In a minute. A minute won't work. Excuse me. Why don't you have a read? You do know I'm busy... You did what? Daddy left me on the bus. Oh, my poor darling. That was some outing. We dodged the fare. - Really? And you got ice cream 'cause Daddy felt guilty. Relax, Anne. Go wash your faces. Good that Mommy sewed her phone number into your clothes, so the uncle on the bus, who happened to be nice, could phone Mommy. She was on her own for ten minutes. You had one job - look after the kids so I can talk to the bank. The bank? - You never listen. And you can't handle two things at once. There was a damn ticket inspector. And Habicht called because of Bogenius. That damn name again. It's important. You know what's important? Your kids. Our family. I am important. Great. And what about me? Think about it. My sister still isn't used to all this, but as we sat there... it was like the old days. She actually ordered a second sundae. Her first ice cream in two years, can you imagine? She's got a long way to go, but we'll get there. I'm really happy for you. I have some good news too. What's that? "We're delighted to inform you that your article 'Child's Play' has been shortlisted for the German Press Award." What? The world's your oyster, my fair-haired friend. Let me give you a hug. Enjoy it. It won't last forever. Say, isn't your sister a diabetic? Yes. They have a great selection for diabetics. What are you doing here? We love you lots and lots, Daddy. And Mommy will love you again tomorrow. I need to go pee. You're right, I'm an idiot. That's why you woke me up? I already knew that. How are we gonna spend the rest of the evening? What's that sexy number? I didn't know the evening would turn out quite this racy. Did you know that 59% of couples with children stop having regular sex? I watched a documentary on Germans' love lives, It was sad. - A what? Good job I'm married to a Spaniard. Shit, the documentary... You going to call me every night now? Remember the guy from the documentary you sent me? Yes, what about him? Let me show you something. Oh, come on. This is the layout I was sent today. And the guy in Bogenius's copy is the same as the one in the documentary. Only that Bogenius calls him Nailer, while in the documentary he's Jack Webber. Hang on a second, let me get this straight. The guy is in a globally screened documentary, but refuses to be photographed? Weird, isn't it? The CHRONIK employs the brightest minds in the industry. They don't just report on German politics, they shape it. The opinions readers form on China or on American foreign policy are devised here. The knights at this round table are the heroes of generations ofjournalists. Warriors whose pens are mightier than any sword. We get close up, right where it matters. The music is a placeholder, we actually got... who? Morituri. - Morituri, awesome band. They did the advert for... - It's still confidential. Oh, I'm not allowed to say. But it's big. I need to see Rainer Maria Habicht. But Rainer didn't order a cab. I'm a colleague. I see. We cannot choose where we find our stories. But we owe it to our readers to portray life even when it hurts. Where did you shoot the refugee center? - On our studio backlot. Then it's faked. We do adverts, not documentaries. - Looks totally real. We can take it out. - No, it looks great. We are the CHRONIKlers of reality, exposing the truth. Each line is rigorously checked. What, now? We never shy away... - I'll be right back. What are you doing here? You can't publish the article. - What? This is "Nailer" in our article. The same guy features in a well-known documentary, except there he's called Jack Webber. And? Something's wrong with Lars's copy. Excuse me? - It's a mistake. You come here claiming Lars made stuff up? I didn't say that, but this is an error. We can't publish falsities. Got any evidence? Well... the names. They're stupid names, they can be verified. You spoke to Documentation? - Yes. And? The facts are okay, but... - Then why bother me? This here is important. Because I... - Romero. I'm going back in there. Ease off and stop getting on my nerves. We portray the complexities of our world, we shine a spotlight, we ask questions, and we take a stand. Everything okay? - Yes, all good. If you ask me why I write this, I do it because it's the truth, and people need to know. CHRONIK THE MAGAZINE The truth. Nothing else. It's good. It's good, isn't it? It's good. But you need to work on the music. Yes, I agree. CUBA A short flight from the picturesque seaside town of Baracoa, which attracts sunseekers even now in winter, guard towers, barracks and mile-long fences emerge in the distance. Looking tense, my pilot, Cirilo, lands our propeller aircraft at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Nah, that won't work. A beautiful vintage taxi takes me from Havana to the other side of the island. Looking relaxed, my driver, Cirilo... Hi Lars, Rainer here. Listen, Romero is breaking my balls, asking stupid questions. Can you deal with it? Looking relaxed, my driver, Cirilo, steers the 1950s Cadillac de Ville through the rugged Cuban landscape. Just as we sense the salty air of the Caribbean, guard towers, barracks and mile-long fences emerge in the distance: Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. COOKING WITH KIDS Smells yucky. - Looks great. Now it looks even better. Alright, girls. When we shoot this, I need you to be very quiet. Okay? - Yes. Juan? Juan. - Yes? Can you take the girls? - Yes, Ma'am. Do you love each other again? - Of course. Told you. - Excuse me. This is Romero. Got something to tell me? Lars. Well? Well what? What did you want to tell me? - You called me. I heard you have questions. - I do. So why didn't you just call me? Instead of whining to Habicht? Whatever... So it's about names? - Among other things. I wrote you an email. - Yeah, I read it. Ever considered these guys might use fake names? Changing their aliases at will? Lars, the stuff they say... I just can't imagine it. Your lack of imagination isn't my problem. Here's the deal. I compile and edit our copy, okay? Not my idea, it came from the top. I'd rather work alone too. Sure, but... No buts. Your behavior is unprofessional and unacceptable. Besides, it could be a way better article if your part wasn't so poor. Excuse me? And why do your emails suggest there are irregularities? Because there are. What you told Habicht borders on defamation. Now hold on... - I'm not your enemy, okay? I'm just trying - not my words - to "save your mediocre writing." So why the grudge? Jealous? Or just stupid? I'm doing all this for both of us. - But... Bogenius? Yes. Bizarre conversation. All accusations, not answering a single question. Maybe there's nothing to answer. He's hiding something. And what might that be? No idea. He met these militia guys. Maybe they told him some boring shit. It doesn't sound boring. Exactly, because you can't do boring in the CHRONIK, least of all Bogenius. So he exaggerates, embellishes, enriches... Wow, that's a massive accusation. - Yes. And if it's true, I'm massively implicated. You know how I feel right now? Stop right there! Drive! - Shit... Who'll get fired first? The permanent superstar reporter or the freelance Spaniard who gets mistaken for a cab driver? I suggest you calm down while I finish my shoot next door. Okay? Yasmin. No way, Juan, please don't drag me into this. You're the only person I can talk to. I'm not sure I like this. The article cannot go to print before it's been properly checked. BORDERLINE This is hitting the shelves tonight. You can't be serious. Yasmin, this is a disaster. It's not reputable journalism. Let me summarize. I'm the co-author of a probably fake cover story in Europe's biggest news magazine. I need to get to the press conference. Don't take it the wrong way. So what do I do? You're a reporter, my friend. Do your job. The way I see it, I have one chance of extracting myself from this. By being the first to get the evidence. What have I actually done to you? The article has been published as the cover story. Can I come over? WAR ON DRUGS So, what about Jack Webber? He got back to me. For 200 dollars he'll do an interview with pictures. We don't pay our sources. Oh well... I'm just saying. Okay, let me do a recap. The article says Chris Jaeger is over 50. According to our research, Jason Miller is only 42. For him to have a 30-year-old daughter who was turned into a drug addict, he would have had to be a father at 12. I know it's theoretically possible to become a father at 12, but... seriously. Okay, it could just be a typo. The article says they captured refugees and kept them for four days in the mountains near Brownsville, Texas. There are no mountains there. Brownsville, Texas, is on the Rio Grande. It's flat as a pancake. In the documentary, Webber says they don't shoot at people. Bogenius has them shooting at Latinos. Following Pablo Escobar's death in 1993, the Medell?n Cartel in Colombia collapsed. Bogenius claims that Colombians were still fleeing from Escobar in 1999. It's total bullshit. RE: INCONSISTENCIES IN THE NEW COVER STORY Why can't I send this email? Because you're cutting off the hand that feeds you? Screw it. SENDING... Can you please go home now? It's regrettable Juan refuses to cooperate. I reached out but he turned his back. Why? He won't find anything, at least nothing major or anything I can't disprove. It's all so futile. And he senses it. It makes him unhappy, stressed, unreasonable. Daddy, dinner's getting cold. I'll be right there. We're all waiting for you. I said I'll be right there! What did I tell you? Well? He'll be right there. He always says that. I'm not cooking for Daddy again. Me neither. Play the monster song. Can't I get any quiet in this house? You should try this, it's delicious. You start eating. We can't eat without Daddy. What the hell was that? You've no idea what's going on. I see what's going on, you shout at your kids, and act like a stubborn ass who just wants to be right. I want vindication. This is a cover story, and that guy is just making shit up! Apparently, I'm the only one who cares. The noble Romero, savior of German journalism. You can talk, with your food porn. At least my food porn is going to pay our rent after you've been fired! Oops. Daddy said "shit". You will be taking this painting with you, won't you? Of course. It's a Jean-Pierre Lumumba, first African in the MoMa. Historic. I'm taking the furniture too. Sure, I'll find some wooden crates to put in here. What about this email? What if there's something to it? That guy's like a rabid squirrel. Every time you walk past, he jumps you and bites you in the neck. It's so annoying. Just in theory, what if Romero's right? Christian, come on, how long have we known each other? 15 years? I'm not an amateur, we verified everything. That's Bogenius's response to Romero's accusations. Ten pages, refuting each point in turn. You read all this? What? Of course. It's all good then. Indeed. Because if Romero was onto something here, you'd have a problem. Why me? Because you're Head of Features. But it was you who hired Bogenius. Now listen to me. In two months, we're in charge here. I don't need any internal feuds. Resolve this in-house before that Spanish smartass kicks off. Your department, your responsibility. I wouldn't want you to order any wooden crates in vain. Hello, Juan, thanks for your email. I'll cut to the chase. We had a close look at the last few weeks, and are very disappointed. The attacks on Lars Bogenius and on our magazine in general, these allegations, accusations, all without any concrete evidence... Please come and see us in the office on Friday. Rainer. What does he mean, "without evidence"? You got plans this week? Why? Hello. This is the mailbox of Yasmin Sal?. Please leave a message. Yasmin, this is Juan. I don't mean to bug you, but please call me back. Ecological balance, struggling small businesses, I couldn't give a damn. What's that doing in our magazine? Sorry to interrupt. Yasmin? Phone call for you. Romero. I'm busy. He called three times already. It's urgent. Discreet as ever. Why call my office? - You don't answer your phone. It's on silent. I'm in a meeting. Didn't you get my email? You haven't replied. You're in serious trouble. From one half-breed to another, Bogenius can refute all your claims. If you don't present anything new on Friday, you're screwed. They're all staring at me, so I'm hanging up, okay? Well? What did she say? Weirdo... Aren't you going to pick up at some point? She does know where we are, though? You think it'll help if you keep ignoring her? You remember Clara? My ex? We were married for three years, two of which I spent traveling for work. It was a really cool time. When we were together, we screwed like there's no tomorrow. We didn't talk much, to be honest. Eventually, she said she wanted kids, a family. I didn't take it seriously at first. But after a while, I realized Clara was the love of my life. So, I got back from a trip to Peru and bought her the flowers she always liked. But when I got home, the place was empty. Just a note on the kitchen table. Know what it said? "Go fuck your cameras instead." Maybe I should have answered more of her calls. GERMAN PRESS AWARDS Ladies and gentlemen, the German Press Awards will commence shortly. Please make your way to your seats. Shit... Come on, give him the 200 dollars. I'm not traveling half-way round the world for nothing. Can you lend me some? Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, much has been said of late about the decline of print journalism. Tonight, we will honor some of our colleagues who are living proof of how vital the printed media is for our information, for our entertainment, and even for our democracy as a whole. You got a signal? Shit. No. They are shining examples for honoring the press code, and I quote, "To adhere to the facts, to respect human dignity, and to truthfully inform the public are the highest principles of the press." The top interview on animal feed, a very important subject. Many thanks. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the main award of the evening, the German Press Award for Best Feature goes to... "Child's Play", the story of a boy whose graffiti triggered the war in Syria. Congratulations to our laureate Lars Bogenius. GERMAN PRESS AWARDS I don't want to talk about myself tonight, but about the article. It's only right. The boy I wrote about, the young man... He's still in that city, which has been shelled for weeks. We haven't heard from him since going to print. It makes it hard to talk about it. I'm afraid I can't tell you where Maroof Atassi is right now. But I'm with him, in my thoughts and in my heart. Very moving words, Lars. Thank you. However, I can reveal this young man is up for another award tonight, for Best Sports Feature, with "Colin Kaepernick - Touchdown". I don't believe it. Bogenius just made it all up. They made a fake article their cover story. Crazy, huh? He just makes something up, and they go and print it. What if his other articles are also fake? Shit... The boy who triggered the war in Syria with his graffiti. The children in Aleppo. The Kaepernick story. Here's what we're gonna do. We'll check every article, go through everything. I'm a photographer, man. But you can read, can't you? This guy is killing me. Shit... 452,817 RESULTS FOR "LARS BOGENIUS" NEW EMAIL SENDING MESSAGE... Alright, I'll wait for you. You go take him down, okay? The guy's finished. Not even he can squirm out of this. Okay? I'll put the champagne on ice. Juan, that's... interesting. Yes... I'll skip the formalities. You go there unannounced, incurring expenses... I paid for everything. - Sure, sure. Don't you think they'd deny anything they told Bogenius? Bogenius was never there. He wasn't there? Right. You turning up and asking questions only made them realize how much Lars prized out of them. They may be dumb, but not that dumb. They won't incriminate themselves. And what happens now? They'll issue a rebuttal, we'll issue a counter statement, maybe legal procedures... Your little trip is going to cost us. Speaking of which, did you pay for that interview? Yes. Webber demanded 200 dollars, or else he wouldn't talk to us. Alright, just hypothetically... We're not accusing you of anything, but, hypothetically... How can we be sure you didn't pay that moron to tell lies about Bogenius? Because I'm a journalist? - So is Lars Bogenius. An outstanding one, with three German Press Awards. Four, actually, since a few days ago. This interview is evidence. I don't go round faking evidence. But Lars Bogenius fakes evidence? Yes. I have some evidence for you. Lars received this email from your Jack Webber guy. He complains about Lars only being with him for a few hours. To summarize, we have this email while you have a video you paid for. Plus, Lars sent Yasmin a link to the website of one of those Border Wolves. Chris... - Chris Jaeger. That's it, Chris Jaeger. There is no Chris Jaeger. - Yeah, sure. His website tells a different story. Lots of photos, postings, the whole shebang. These people are super active on social media. It's easy to research, you just need to look on... ...the net. - Yes. I did my research, there are numerous inconsistencies. In his other articles too. This is getting ridiculous. I contacted Colin Kaepernick's lawyer, the football player. Lars probably never... - That's enough, end of discussion. This whole spectacle is absurd. You've lost it. Rainer, leave it. It's just that... We think our mutual trust has been... Well, you know. We'll find a solution. We appreciate you have two kids. - Four. Four? - Four. Wow. The article is totally fake. They'll rip you a new hole when this gets out. And if we don't go public with this, then... Then? Somebody else will. Are you trying to blackmail us, Juan? They completely stonewalled me. I don't know when you'll be back or what state you'll be in when you read this. I'm taking the kids to my parents and we'll stay there for now. I don't mean to hurt or punish you, but things can't go on the way they've been lately. You shout, you just disappear, and just do your own thing. What happened to the man I love? We used to be a team, we discussed everything, work or relationship... We always found a solution. This morning, the kids asked me if Daddy still loves them. I can't even tell them where you are. Anne, it's me. I'm so sorry. I got completely caught up in this. I know I've let you down. I can forget about working in journalism for a while. They're going to destroy me. It doesn't matter. I'll just do something else. Cab driver, or... I'll even work in television. I want you to know that, okay? I miss you all. Do you know Lorenzo Gonzales? Lorenzo Gonzales lived in a tiny village by the sea. A small, weedy man, 71 years old and a father of ten. Life was tough for the boatbuilder and his family. Lorenzo worked hard and lived frugally. Each month, he put away some of his hard-earned money so he could give his children a good education. But then, disaster struck. The Great Depression meant Lorenzo's savings weren't even worth the paper they were printed on. From one day to the next, he'd become destitute. The old man was distraught. How was he going to feed his beloved family? Once a year, the traveling fair came to Lorenzo Gonzalez's village. "Who dares enter the ring to fight El Feo?" The prize if the giant hit the deck was 1,000 pesetas. In his desperation, Lorenzo Gonzalez took up this impossible challenge. El Feo was huge and strong, but not very agile. Lorenzo, by contrast, was very nimble for a man of his age. It was his only chance to make the fight drag on for a few rounds. The villagers initially found the bizarre clash amusing. But with each new round, the crowd grew more impatient, old Lorenzo Gonzales got more tired, and El Feo got bored. It was only a matter of time before El Feo landed his knock-out blow on the little old man. That's if the thing with the rotten fish hadn't happened. "The rotten fish helped you out." To this day, people from my home say this when someone in a seemingly hopeless situation has their ass saved by some incredible coincidence. My rotten fish was a celebrity lawyer from California. Los Angeles. - Yeah, sure, Hollywood. That was Colin Kaepernick's lawyer. Let's cast our minds back. Lars Bogenius was the only journalist worldwide who was granted an interview with the football star's adoptive parents. Or was he? I put this question to Kaepernick's lawyer in an email. So, what did he say? Nothing. He shouted. What did he shout? Bogenius never spoke to... his... parents... It's all made up? But that's shit. Shit. It's total shit. Shit... It's so shit. Shit. Romero... that asshole. Yasmin. - Bad time? No, not at all. Come in. Thanks. It's nice of you to drop by. I thought we should get together and talk strategy for when we're running the department. Can I get you a drink? Water? Tea? No, cappuccino with oat milk, right. That social media page you sent me... Chris Jaeger's? - Yes. What about it? How old is it? No idea. Have a guess. I'm not sure. Ten years? ...no chance of finding him online. Hold on. And suddenly he's got a webpage. JOINED ON 08.29.2018 The profile was created two days ago, not ten years ago. By you. I'll go and do the laundry next. Hello. Where's your sister, by the way? That's not her, is it? You made up your sister. Man, you make me sick. Juan. - Bad time? Well, recently... What do you want? - Justice. What? - Juan... Not now. I knew it. I can prove it all. Every single lie, every single fake. Not the awards! You ruined my life! - Shit, stop it! Yasmin, call the police! - They won't save you now. Have you lost your mind? You're dead! This was how I pictured this story would end. Maybe it would in a Bogenius article, who knows? In reality, things played out a little differently. As Lars Bogenius's pack of lies caved in, I was sleeping off my hangover. At the same time, an IT expert at the CHRONIK uncovered something extraordinary. Email servers tend to retain pretty much any information, including the original email by a certain Jack Webber to Lars Bogenius. Can't we just delete it? MOSCOW: KREMLIN CRITIC VANISHES Let's get this over and done with. I'll read out the titles... and you respond with "true" or "not true". "Number 440"? THE PRISONER... NUMBER 440 Not true. "Child's Play"? Not entirely true. "Royal Children"? Well, the charity collection was true. Kind of. Shit. Those kids never existed. And you were never there. "Touchdown"? You're wondering why the world didn't notice? I promised the parents it'll only be published in Germany, and not online, or behind a paywall. They're worried it'll cause a stir in the U.S. I understand. We need to respect that. "Jaeger's Frontier" What's all this about? What are we doing here? What's the point in all this? A quest for truth? What hubris. I just did my job. I did exactly what you asked of me. How did you always put it? What matters most about a story is its dramatic arc. The real world out there is boring, dull, dreary. We add the drama. We provide a narrative, a plot, twists. No one wants to be told reality differs from what they think. They don't want anything new. People want what they already know. They don't read an article looking for truths. They crave validation. You don't buy a magazine that tells you you're clueless, naive, stupid. No, you buy a magazine that presents your view of the world, the way you see it, and that tells exciting stories. Remember? It's very simple. Protagonist, antagonist, a duel. Less tedium, more Tarantino. I may have invented the odd character and exaggerated a little. But that's my only route to what you want from me: the emotional truth. Anyone can do facts, you don't need a writer for that. Our mission is to bring you, our readers, so close to the issues that they become visceral. In all their injustice, in all their magnitude. Bogenius has written approximately 60 articles in recent years. Almost all of it was made up. The scandal sent shockwaves through German media. The CHRONIK had been taken for a ride. Of course their competitors jumped on it. It was global news, and some people really enjoyed it. The CHRONIK had to seize the initiative. They needed to investigate it all and have a big clear-out, starting with the former Deputy Editor-in-Chief in waiting. His superior, the former Editor-in-Chief in waiting, also had to clear his desk. THE TRUTH. NOTHING ELSE. They now have plenty of time to focus on their handicap. Shit! While the new Editor-in-Chief started by ordering some wooden crates. I do feel sorry for the fact-checker guy, though. There are differing theories on what became of Lars Bogenius. Some claim to have seen him in Hamburg, others in Florida. Some say he got completely entangled in his own lies, and now he's in therapy in Bavaria, and on the road to recovery. Hi, I'm Lars. Hello Lars. Would you like to tell us your story? It all started with my sister. But your sister doesn't exist, Lars. I know, but it all started with her. It was all very confusing, and, ultimately, nobody really knew where he was. The last thing I read about him was his Wikipedia entry. I picture it something like this... "His peers describe him as an outstanding writer, a magnificent colleague, and a hugely talented, yet modest person, without the arrogance of other CHRONlKjournalists. Throughout his career, he has been compared to the greats, such as Egon Erwin Kisch, Tom Wolfe, or Truman Capote." Like I said, we can't be sure. What we do know for sure is that he hired a lawyer. Mr. Bogenius, I'm your legal counsel and first responder to the media. First we'll sue them. All of them. Meanwhile, I was busy straightening things out at home. It wasn't quite that bad. It wasn't like this either. Anyway, I'll spare you the sentimentalities. What matters is I have my family back. I don't know if I'll always be a journalist. But I don't want my children to grow up in a world of fake news. Making up stories is a wonderful thing, but there's no place for it in journalism. So, next time people tear into the "lying, fake-news media" - maybe in my presence as I've experienced it up close - I'll speak out. It wasn't journalism that lied, journalism was lied to. But the true facts only got exposed through journalism too. It's something only journalism can achieve. It may sound dramatic, that's because it is. This year's "Journalist of the Year" is Juan Romero. Bravo! Oh yes! Thank you for this award. It means a lot to me, as you're about to find out. First and foremost, I'd like to thank my wife. Maybe she can put her phone down. I want to use this moment to tell her a few things that are long overdue. I love you, Anne. I admire your energy, your wit, your habit of seeing the best in everyone. I admire you for never giving up hope. Just over 14 months ago, our family had to withstand an earthquake. Earthquakes are always horrific. But often, the aftershocks can be even worse. Dear Anne, I'm sorry. Neither you nor our daughters deserved what I put us through. Please forgive me. Yes! Say, Daddy? - Yes, darling? Is this new? What? Mommy's cell phone. - Shush. Then I could have her old one. Jule, we talked about this. Only when you're 12. Everyone in my class has one, apart from me. I don't have one either. Let's listen to Daddy's speech. Daddy... - That's enough now. If you ask me how my life has changed... not a lot, really.
