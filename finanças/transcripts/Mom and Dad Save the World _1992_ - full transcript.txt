AFTER THE WEDDING, I'LL SEARCH THE DESERT FOR YOUR HUSBAND. - MY HUSBAND'S DEAD, THANK YOU! - SILENCE! I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE HE EJECTED FROM HIS SHIP. YOU MEAN... HE'S ALIVE? Afir: PERHAPS. AND IF HE IS, HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN SAVE THIS PLANET FROM SPENGO'S MISGUIDED TYRANNY. MISGUIDED? BEFORE I CAME TO POWER WAS THERE A FORTRESS? WAS THERE A MAGNO BEAM? WAS THERE A DEATH RAY?

MARRY ME, NOW. AND AS FOR YOU, DEATH IS TOO GOOD FOR A TRAITOR. AFTER THE WEDDING WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE COMMAND CENTER, AND WE WILL INSERT YOU INTO THE DEATH RAY. WE WILL WATCH YOU DIE AS WE WATCH EARTH DIE. SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME NOW, AFIR? I THINK YOU'RE A SMALL, PATHETIC, INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE CRETIN. OH, REALLY? WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME NOW? ( birds tweeting ) OH... TOD. I LOVE YOU. MARRY ME? NO, SORRY. MARRYING MARGE. TAKE HIM AWAY. - ( Afir grunts ) - TRAITOR! TRAITOR! OH, TOD, YOU'RE SUCH A BRAVE MAN. WHEN CAN WE GO AWAY TOGETHER? SHORTLY, MY LOVE. THE SECOND WE ARE WED, WE'LL BOARD MY PRIVATE ROCKET, AND I'LL WH-- I'LL WHISK YOU AWAY TO MY PRIVATE MOON, LITTLE DOT, AND THERE WE WILL ENJOY CONJUGAL BLISS AS WE WATCH YOUR EX-PLANET BEING DESTROYED. UNTIL THEN... ( gags ) ACK! AHEM. AH! YOU'RE WELCOME! PINHEAD. SEND A PLATOON INTO THE DESERT. FIND THE EARTH-DICK AND EXECUTE HIM AT ONCE! YES, LORD TOD! ( dramatic music playing ) THE DEATH CART! THE DEATH CART IS COMING! THE DEATH CART IS COMING! ( echoes ) THIS IS IT! PREPARE TO LEAVE! THAT'S, UH... GOOD! THAT'S GOOD. LET'S HOPE THESE PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY STUPID.
