Please come in. Please come in. Good morning. Please sit. You two are here early. Mr. Li, you have a rare bird there. A friend bought this bird in Thailand. You can't buy one here in China. Sir, what would you like to drink? Jasmine tea. A pot of jasmine tea! Come in, please. Yes… That's right… Good morning, Mr. Ma. This is my table. Who said you can sit here? This is your table? I didn't know. I'll move then. I'll move. You sat at my table. Think you can just leave? Not so easy! You got a pretty nice bird there. And it matches with mine perfectly. Leave the bird and you can go. Mr. Ma, I'm not selling this bird. Be glad I'm going easy on you! How can you be so unreasonable? Second brother, the Hook Gang is causing trouble. Die! Ma, don't over do it! You mind your own business, Yu! Robbing others in broad daylight. It is my business! Dammit! Don't get tough just because you're from Zhengde School. The Hook Gang ain't afraid of anyone! Just return the bird. Get him! Yu, if you got the guts, fight me in the valley. Alright, I'll be waiting for you! Second brother, they're here. Hurry! Yu Tian Long, the Hook Gang has no quarrel with Zhengde School. You attacked my brother. Explain yourself! The Hook Gang is constantly bullying others. Today I'll teach you a lesson in place of your teacher! Then you're saying we're going to fight it out? Everyone in the Hook Gang are nothing but thugs! Dammit. Kill them! Run! Second brother, what will we do if teacher finds out? Put it all on me. I'll take the blame. - Hong Gang. - Yes, teacher. As the eldest student, you haven't been watching them. Now they've gotten into trouble! Yes, teacher. I've been busy at the dyeing and brick factory recently. If I had come sooner, everything would've been alright. Tian Long, amongst your brothers, you have trained the hardest. I never thought you'd be one to cause such trouble. As a martial artist, there is no doubt the importance of kung fu. But one's character is even more important. Should your martial arts be used to hurt others, it becomes the greatest taboo against your training. I'm fully aware, teacher. But the Hook Gang has been causing trouble in the entire town. I couldn't allow them to commit robbery in broad daylight. To stop the Hook Gang from committing robbery, you bravely came forward. There is no fault in this. But you allowed your courage to be stained with the lust for blood. And fought against them afterwards. How is that an act of chivalry? Yes, I was too rash and gave no thought about the consequences. The Hook Gang boss, Shao Laoliu, sells both drugs and women. Evil in all ways possible. And he's had his eyes on our factories for a long time. Now there's conflict between our two schools. I fear the matter won't be let off so easily. Teacher, what you're saying is, the Hook Gang are men with no honour. Then… People must act within reason. Tian Long broke the code of our school. He'll be punished at the altar as according to code. Although they attacked our men, we should just end the matter here. - Yes, teacher. - The joss sticks! Tian Long, prepare for your punishment. Yes. Tian Long, as your punishment, you'll clean the altar for 3 days. Kneel for 1 day. And be struck 3 times! Close the altar gates. Go practice in the front. Fools! A bunch of goddamn fools They even disgraced our name! How did the fight start? We were at the teahouse. He brought his men and insisted on having our table. We argued and then started fighting. I wouldn't let him go and challenged him to a fight. That Han Tui really has the nerve! We have no quarrel with Zhengde School. How could he let his students run loose? - Tian Bao. - Yes, teacher. Which student attacked you? Teacher, it was Yu Tian Long. The second student in rank. No wonder you lost to him. Among the old man's top four students, Yu is the most talented and strongest. Tell him. Teacher. Teacher. Yu said… Speak up. Stop beating around the bush! Speak! Did he say something to insult us? Yes, he said he'll even teach you a lesson. Ridiculous! Even that old man Han Tui bows down to me in my sight. How dare that little boy even insult me? - Tian Bao! - Yes, sir. Bring my weapon. Assemble the men. I'll go and redeem our honour. ZHENGDE SCHOOL Master Shao, how unexpected to see you today. Han Tui, your students really know how to put on a good show. Master Shao, Yu has been punished. We had wished to pay you a visit and apologise. Since you're here, there's no better opportunity. Very well said, old man Han. You surely know how to take advantage of others. What? Your student has no manners. Not only did he attack my men, he even said he wanted to teach me a lesson. I'd like to see just how. Master Shao, don't be misled by others. My student would never insult you even if he's foolish. Old man Han, stop protecting him. Just hand over Yu Tian Long to me. Or else… Or else what? Or else we'll see who is the better fighter! Master Shao, our styles may be different but all martial arts stem from the same origin. We are neighbours living in the same town. Why must we let a trivial matter like this break our peace? Easier said than done! Master Shao. You're going to hand him over or not? Master Shao, I've already punished him. So this means you refuse to hand him over?! Teacher! My apologies. Fine. Get them! Stop! Teacher! Shao Laoliu, you hid dirks in your hooks. This is just too low of you. Han, only one of us lives. I will never lose to you! You just wait and see! Sooner or later, I'll bring death and carnage to your school! Let's go. Don't worry. Second brother. Oh it's you. I thought it was teacher. What was all the noise outside about? I came to tell you, second brother. Mr. Shao of the Hook Gang came for you. He demanded teacher hand you over. Teacher refused and a fight erupted. How did it go? Teacher was stabbed with a hidden dirk. It's only a scratch. Teacher almost crippled him in return. But before he left, he said he'll be back to finish our school. Him? But it was my fault and got teacher involved. I'm afraid there'll be more trouble coming. - Tian Bao. - Yes, Teacher. The Hook Gang's reputation was not easy to earn. Now it has been lost all because of you! My entire life has been thrown into the wind. I have no choice but to get vengeance! Yes, sir. Last year, Mr. Mo, the accountant, went to Shanghai on business matters. Visited the northern military chief. I heard they hired many top foreign fighters as bodyguards. I must get their help to get rid of that old man Han Tui! Well done! Good kung fu! Gentlemen, please come inside. Sit down, please. Please sit. As mentioned in our letter last time, we hoped your teacher would come to lend a hand. What is his answer? Our teacher's already on his way from Okinawa. He'll be here in a couple of days. That's wonderful. Come, let me introduce you. This is our boss. And that is Hasegawa-San and Sakata-San. This is judo expert, Koji-San. And this is Korean Taekwondo expert, Kim Jim Yong. And here are the steel and bronze leg brothers from Thailand, Nai Cai and Mi Sao. This is yoga expert, Mura Singh of India. How do you do? - With your skills, we'll win for sure. - Teacher! A visitor from Okinawa. Our teacher's here. Hurry, let him in. Sir, this is our boss. Please. Please sit. As chief of Okinawa's martial arts you came such a long way to a small town like ours and offer your service. Our boss is truly grateful beyond words. Spare me the pleasantries. I've heard a lot about Chinese boxing. This'll give me a chance to test it. When do we fight? Sir, you must be tired from your trip. Today, I prepared a feast to welcome my friends from afar. Being tired means nothing to a fighter. To be tired is part of the training. As for the feast, cancel it. Sir, old man Han is a strong fighter and has many students. Before we attack, we're still waiting for two Lama masters to arrive. This shall guarantee our victory. Mr. Mo, teacher means to say, Okinawan martial arts is invincible. We don't need any pyjama wearing Lamas. Let's fight now! Never insult Tibetan martial arts. Let this be your lesson! Let's talk it over. Let's talk it over. Please calm down! You all came so far to serve me. Please forgive me for my offences. - Please sit down, gentlemen. - Sit. Sit. Not only is there the matter of a fight, I'd like to discuss some business also. The Hook Gang has been selling opium for many years with lands on the border of Yunnan. But when the opium is shipped inland, there are often bandits. Making things difficult. After the fight, I hope you'll stay. Help me with future consignments leveraging your skills. With the income from the operations, I can promise you a share of 60/40. You'll each get 400,000 silver dollars. It's a deal then! Zhengde School runs the brick and dyeing factory. We'll attack their brick factory tomorrow. This factory is run by Zhengde School. - See if they're here to buy bricks. - Right. Would you like to buy some bricks? What's the meaning of this?! We heard there are top fighters in Zhengde School. We've come to see if it's true. Good. Surround them! - We have customers. Go and see. - Okay. If you'd like some cloth, the cashier's inside. Mr. Li, someone came and killed Xiao San. Stop fighting! Xiao Li, the Hook Gang brought these men. - Notify Brother Hong and Brother Yu, quick! - Yes, sir. Ma Wudao! Did you bring these killers? Second brother! They just left. After them! It's Yu Tian Long! Lure him inside. It's a dead end. After them. Strange. There's no other way out. Look around. He's hurt. Finish him. Let's go. SPIRIT TABLETS MEMORIAL TO THE DECEASED My students, so much ruin for one day. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li have met unfortunate deaths. The factories are heavily damaged. The Hook Gang is behind all of this. Fortunately in this unfortunate event, Tian Long was able to escape. Now the Hook Gang has hired killers. Attacked so many of our men. Let alone they wreak havoc everywhere they go. Selling drugs and women. There's no limit to their evil ways! We'll hold a funeral so they may rest in peace. - And after, we'll get our revenge! - Right! Don't bother! Shao Laoliu, you came right on time. We have a score to settle. I came to repay my debt. Your ways are inhumane! I said there'd be blood and carnage. Not enough dead yet. Drop dead! Fine, let's just wait and see! Let me pay you back with some interest. This is the chief from Okinawa, Natini Taro. His students Hasegawa-San and Sakata-San. Judo expert, Koji-San. Taekwondo expert, Kim Jim Yong. Also Tibetan Lamas Zuo Long and Zuo Hu. Yoga expert, Mura Singh. Iron Foot Nai Cai and Bronze Foot Mi Sao. Old man Han, didn't you always say Chinese boxing was so great? Today you'll see first-hand foreign boxing. Shao Laoliu! You're a disgrace to your ancestors! So many dead men laying right here! If you hadn't come looking for me, I'd come looking for you! Whatever tricks you have, show me what you've got! I came ready to die anyway. No one leaves till one of us is dead. Choose your fighter! Ah-Xiong, fight. Master Kim, please. Take him away. Ah-De, your turn. Brother Kim, stand back! Koji-San, great job! Let me try!! Teacher, let me try. Today is a duel to the death. This Lama is very powerful. Better be careful. Yes, teacher. Brother. Chen… I see now. Each one is more dangerous than the other! Take him away. Teacher, what is this? It's a type of Siamese ritual performed before fighting. Old man Han, you think so highly of yourself. Pity your fighters are good for nothing idiots. - You! - Teacher. Let me fight. Tian Long used the Hung Gar fist very well. Tian Long! He broke my student's arm. I take his arm. Should've taken more. He lost his arm but he'll live. Treat him inside. Shao Laoliu, if you have the guts, you come out yourself! We'll fight to the death! You're no match to fight me. Tibetan Qigong. Good Tibetan palm technique. Old man Han, your martial art is very good. Our Tibetan arts originated from Chinese martial arts. I'll let you live this time. That's all there is to Lama martial arts. What? Master Zuo. Master Zuo, we're on the same side. Please calm down! Watch me. The Teleporting Mountain Fist. Teacher. Get them! MEMORIAL TO THE DECEASED It's almost dark. It doesn't matter. At least a sick man was saved. A dead man! He's lost an arm but he's alive. We'll take him back. Tian Long. Don't you often like to watch the waterfall from that rock? Why do you look so sad coming down? I'm not in the mood today. Let's go. I've had enough of you. Recently every time we're having fun, there's something on your mind. Don't know what you're always moody about. Xiao Yu, since your father saved my life and nursed me back to health, your father taught me herbal medicine, acupuncture and treatment. I should be happy, but… each time I look at this missing arm, I can't forget about teacher's death. I realise I've become a cripple. And my heart sinks into despair. Tian Long, you can still train in martial arts. For a martial artist, losing an arm means the end of everything. When I was little, I heard father once say… he discovered an herbal plant and made it into a medicine that allows you to train in something called the "Crippled Fist". Father said whoever learns the Crippled Fist can break rocks with both hands. It's truly incredible. But I have only one hand. You can still train with one hand. After you master it, you'll no longer be so moody every day. Is it true? Is it really true? Yes, but father said it requires you to burn your hand with fire. It'll be very painful. Can you take the pain? If I can learn the Crippled Fist, then I won't care about the pain. Right, let's go ask father. This is the special herbal medicine. I discovered it when I was a young man. It's been fermenting for 30 years. I've never used it but now it'll be used to help you learn the Crippled Fist. However, to train in this art, you must burn all the nerves in your hand with fire. If one nerve remains, the training will not be possible. You must consider it carefully. Yes, I've made my decision. If I can learn the Crippled Fist, I'll take any pain. Good! Seems you're truly determined. As long as you can bear it, we'll start immediately. Get the medicines ready, hurry! All his nerves have been burnt. Hurry and lift him up. From now on, his hand must be treated for a month for it to work. You must take good care of him. Yes, I understand. Tian Long, did you really master the Crippled Fist? What's so great about it? Alright. You watch this. What do you think? You've destroyed the pavilion. It'll take days to rebuild it. I'm leaving! Xiao Yu. Xiao Yu, you wanted to see my abilities. Don't blame me. I didn't ask you to wreck things. Alright, don't get angry. I'll rebuild it tomorrow. Look at you! Your hand's already scary! Why do you need to train more? If you keep on training, I don't know what will become of you. Xiao Yu, if I had two hands to fight against those bastards, I'd defend with one hand and strike with the other. Now I only have one hand. If I'm not strong enough to withstand my enemy's attack, or can't finish my enemy with one blow, then I'll be the one to die at my enemy's hands. I get it. You mean if you had two hands, you could defend with one and hit with… the other. Tian Long! Tian Long, I'm sorry! Wake up! Xiao Yu, I was only joking. Don't be angry. I don't care. Take me to the theatre as punishment. Alright. Let's head into town. More than half a year's passed. And I want to know what those bastards are up to. See if they've met misfortune or fortune. FORTUNE Let's sit over there. - What will you two have? - Longjing tea. A pot of Longjing tea! Tian Long, didn't you come to gather news? What are we doing in a teahouse? This is near to the Hook Gang's place. It's safer here for you. Wait for me. It's getting late. We should return before dark. Once I've gathered the news I need, I'll come back. - Okay. Come back soon. - Alright. KOJI DOJO Friend, nothing but bad men in there. Best you stay away. Please come in. This way, please. Sitting here today? Alright. Two guests. Ma Wudao, your teacher left a month and half ago and hasn't returned. Do you think something happened? Master Kim, don't you worry. The Okinawa master is with him. There won't be any problems. He'll return in a couple of days. Then we'll get our money, right? Master Kim, how can we even forget about your share? It's at least 50,000 silver dollars this time. We've made a lot in these 6 months. It's just there aren't any pretty girls in this small town. What a bore! Well… Speak of the devil. There's a pretty girl over there. Not bad. Master Kim, seems she's all by herself. Watch my lead. Aren't you a pretty one. Miss, let me invite you for a drink. Please show some respect. - Don't go now. - Out of my way! Don't go. You dare hit me?! Take her away! Help! Help! The Hook Gang?! Ma Wudao, we finally meet again. So you're still alive? Hell was full so they kicked me out. Kid, let me see if you can still fight with one hand. You're mine! Let's get out of here! You killed all of them. These bastards were better off dead. Ma Wudao, where's your teacher? He's… running a consignment. Who else is at your place? Besides Koji, everyone is out! We better get out of here. No, you go first. Why? I want to take the chance when the bastards are out and take care of Koji first. One less fighter will weaken their defenses. KOJI DOJO Hey, one hand! The hell you want? You want to learn judo? Where's Koji? Tell him to come out. Dammit! You got the nerve to ask for our teacher? You better call him Koji-sensei, or I'll break your other arm! Watch that mouth of yours. Just because you learned judo, doesn't make your ancestors Japanese. What? You dare lecture me? This broken hand is unbreakable. Get him! Who the hell are you? Did you forget that blood was spilt at Zhengde School half a year ago? So you're not dead. Let me send you to hell! Hold it! Nobody leaves! Come back, all of you. We have a score to settle. When Shao Laoliu returns, tell him this. I'll be expecting him at the quarry in 3 days to settle the score for Zhengde School. Master Natini Taro, we're to meet with the kid tomorrow. How many men do you think we should bring? The kid only has one arm. What's there to be so worried about? If I had known, I wouldn't have let him live. He became strong in a short time. Best not to underestimate him. The kid was able take the lives of Koji and Kim single-handedly. Seems he must've acquired a special kung fu skill. I think we should be more prepared. You go home and sleep. Except for the two Lamas, everything's been arranged. If he dares to come tomorrow, he won't get away even if he has 10 lives! A man has 616 double pressure points and 51 single pressure points. Contact with lethal pressure points can lead to ultimate death. I taught you about this in the past. Do you still remember? Yes. You said there were Lamas at the fight. Their technique is also called "Mi Zong" and comes from Tibet. It differs greatly from Chinese boxing. Lamas can control their circulation and close all lethal pressure points. Neither hand or sword is able to hurt them. Father, are you saying the Lamas are invincible? How will Tian Long defeat them? Silly girl. They're men and can still die. Even if all the lethal pressure points are closed there's still one pressure point that can kill them. I took out this diagram today to show you where that one pressure point lies. Even if the Lamas really possess such skill, you can finish them by hitting this pressure point. Yes, Uncle Bo. Where's that pressure point? Right here. It's called the "Shangqu" pressure point. 1 inch below the shoulder, 2 inches from the chest. Right side, 2 inches from the chest. A classic Chinese saying, "Know the enemy and yourself, fight a hundred battles without defeat." Should the Lamas possess no such skill, it does you no harm knowing this knowledge. Uncle is right. I'll remember this. Tomorrow will be a fight to the finish. It will be hard. You'd better get some rest. Teacher, the kid's here. Yu, this is the day you die! I wouldn't be here if I was afraid to die! Call out your monsters to fight me! Dammit! Tian Bao! You were lucky last time and only lost your arm. Today, you'll lose more than that! Get him! He can stand upside down with only a finger! Dammit! Your Iron Finger Technique is good! Pity I've lost my right arm long ago. Teacher, why hasn't Natini Taro come out to fight yet? The Okinawa chief and Zuo Long have a personal grudge. They'll never fight alongside each other. - Hurry and get the bombs! - Yes, sir! That's all there is to Tibetian Palm technique! Blow him up! We got him! Dammit! Teacher, the kid's over there! I'll wait for you below! Come down if you dare! After him! Your Iron Head is not bad! Come on!
