What is it? Leaving? Leaving? Leaving? Leaving? That's right. Hey, Tanaka. Weren't you supposed to go home tomorrow? No way to get there. Want to come with us? Maybe. Well, I need to get paid first. Shut up, you know-nothing. Hey, a little quieter? Presenting my paybook. Amount is correct. Tanaka? Leaving tomorrow? Yes, to see my grandmother Oh, grandmother? Make it fast. That hurts! Put up with the pain. This is my head. A soldier must endure pain. This soldier's head is bleeding. Well ... kindly do your best. Okay for time? Yeah, okay. Lights out. I was having my hair cut. Returning. What's wrong with your head? They were trying their best but... it will be lights out before it can be finished. Really? Then cut it early tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. Cut it early tomorrow morning.

How are they doing? Hey, there will be an inspection of the gold and silver accounts at 8 o'clock. Student Yashiro has 78 sen left. Student Tanaka has 37 sen left. This entry for "confectionery 2 yen". What was that? It was anpan. Anpan? 2 yen for anpan. For one person? There were four people. Who, who and who? Yukimoto, Yamamura and Sato. Yukimoto. Yamamura. Sato. Come here. 80 anpan for 4 people? In other words, you each ate 20 in one sitting? The other day I received a letter from my grandmother. She told me that my sister had been born. We bought anpan for a celebration. It was a feast for everyone. I said that we only needed 10 pieces each. Yukimoto said “If you have any, you have to have 20”. I said “I don’t feel like eating 20”. Who needs to eat so much during a celebration? You already have enough nutrition for your body. If you break your body, what will you do? Your body is not your own. Your body ... Tanaka What have I taught you? I am of the Japanese Empire. Yukimoto. I am of the Japanese Empire. Sato. I am of the Japanese Empire. Yamamura. I am of the Japanese Empire. So then the Great Japan Empire is each one of you. You will not order 20 anban again. I will not order. I will not order. I will not order. I will not order. Don't do anything like that from now on! Be careful in the future. In general, the inspection of gold and silver accounts was satisfactory. But this matter of 20 anban... The army’s fighting power requires a healthy body. Especially the aviation service. You must be careful about this. The Captain has often taught exactly this. It’s fine to eat anban but don't do what these have done. Don't eat 20 pieces at once. Be satisfied with no more than 10. Understood? Yes, I understand. Attention! Salute! Today's scheduled flight lesson is one we've practiced before. You eight students will practice formation flying. Sato Student Number 28 piloting, Course Compliation No.1 Tanaka student No. 22 piloting, Course Compilation No. 2 Osugi Student Number 23 piloting, Course Compilation No. 3 Five Yamamura students. End of aircraft operation. Completed! Generally, your take-off, formation holding and landing were good. I did see one thing though... Number 1, don't come in so steeply. Formation flying is different from that of a single machine. You have to think about wingmen. Each of you affect the other. There are a few gaps in the Unit 2 formation. No. 3 Good No. 5 is a little off in altitude. Especially, avoid over-corrections. Keep your flight control movements smooth. When landing, the 4th aircraft was lagging behind. Everyone else, good. Your recent training indicates a lack of enthusiasm and fighting spirit. I see the frustration. A word of caution... As long as there have been human beings, they have searched for a meaningful death. We soldiers are not the only ones who want to die in a fine way. The fact that a human dies fine is the same as living fine. This is the spirit of Nippon Bushido. This belief of life-and-death spirit is at the heart of a belief in God. We are worshiped in the same spirit of exaltation given to all soldiers since Emperor Meiji. In training or in combat, we are ordinary men. Feelings of anxiety and frustration are understandable in training but must be overcome. Please be patient and study harder. You should try to elevate the spirit of Nippon Bushido. In the near future, you will graduate from here and become heroes of the Imperial Army Air Force. It can be difficult to leave the nest. Devote your spirit, body, and desires to the attainment of this goal. Two years later November, 1939 North Support Line Jinso airbase I am Captain Yamamoto. I am to become the fighter squadron commander on January 18th. I have just arrived. With all respect. You seem to have been in combat before. About half a year following the Takimizo Bridge Incident. After which I served at the Imperial Army Flight Academy. The Youth Training Program pilots you have been sending us are pretty good. Do you know if Captain Yamamoto has arrived? That's what the teenagers are telling us. Do you know where Captain Yamamoto is? Talking to the base commander at headquarters. So, Nara, he's one of your instructors? That's what I thought. We need to welcome Captain Yamamoto. Let's do it right away. I think it's a good idea. Let me do all the planning. What are you going to do? Inaba, all I ask is that we have a lot to drink. I'll take care of everything. A welcome party? That should keep you out of trouble for a while. For a while. Tanaka, Captain Yamamoto has come to see you. Ah, some former students of mine. Takachi. Well, congratulations. Congratulations. It's been a long time. Congratulations. I’m glad to see your cheerful faces. We all wanted to come see you. Because of a foul-up, I’m sorry we couldn't greet you sooner. Don't mind that. How is everyone? Things going well? Yes, very well. These days, Akanya paints walls. I no longer fly. Do you still remember how? It’s a pity that there’s no Tanaka around. Yes, Tanaka fought bravely and died a fine death. I heard about Tanaka back home. He was a good man. It’s not an easy thing to hear. Commander, we haven’t made any contribution ourselves yet. You've just had bad luck. It will change. Student Sato. Osaki. Sato, you are no longer a student. Aren't you a soldier now? I am. I heard you were in bombers. Yes, the Nara squadron. Do well and be healthy. Try to relax occasionally. It’s like you’re back in school. Major Shimabara is looking for you. Everyone get to bed early. Proper sleep is most important. Now all you here, the squadron has another arrow in it's quiver. Two or three arrows! We'll start work on our fighting spirit beginning tomorrow. Alright! It used to bother me. That moment when you get the enemy in your sights. Seeing their plane flip over and dive to the ground. Don't feel sorry. It is the mercy of the samurai. You won because you’re the best. Do you think the enemy pilots feel sorry for you? One day, I had a enemy parachute in my sights. I still wouldn't shoot. You guys are terrible. Not shoot someone in a parachute? A pilot is a weapon. Like any weapon, if you don't destroy it, it can rise up again and kill you. So blast everything in sight. More and more shots. Nara squadron is back. Sato made it back. Lieutenant Sakamoto and 27 men completed the bombing of Shenyang. All airplanes returned. What's wrong? All the bombs hit exactly on target today. But I did feel like every gun on the ground was aiming at the tip of my nose. After dinner today, I have some errands. Yamamura! Yamamura! Yamamura, are you okay? I'm fine. Yamamura, we have to set fire to your plane. Yamamura! Yamamura. Was it dangerous? Really, was it dangerous? I can't believe I finally managed to shoot down an enemy. I'm looking at the face of someone who just made it back from First Street in Hell. You did good, really good. Everyone have a drink of this. You know, sometimes you don't do smart things. Everyone on the mission got back in one piece. Including Osaki. Would you like to get drunk? This will make Yamamura live longer. Hey, emergency landing! Grab some cups. Get a cup and line up. - Sake is great anytime. - Congratulations. Everyone is very lively. Yes, Sato brought a little sake for Yamamura. We're just drinking it now. Commander Yamamoto, how about one? Let's have a toast. How about a cup, Inaba? Let’s include everyone. Duty officer? Get the bottle from my room and come have a drink. How about another one? I'll forgive you tonight so everyone can drink a lot. It's not every day there is crash landing. Today was good. What's that you say? Today was good? Not me, Yamamura. It was okay I guess. Tonight was fun. Yeah, it was fun Thanks for saving my life. I owe you. There's no one better than you two guys. Are you okay? Sato, you're not like me but that's okay. Well, good night. Good night. Good night, take care. ♪ Evening sky without clouds. The autumn wind is blowing. ♪ Moonlight falling and crickets trilling. ♪ How far away is my native sky? ♪ Oh, my mother and father. How are they doing? Got a cigarette? Let's do this... Let's stick to each other. Bomber crews gather! Let's go out after dinner tonight. Can't wait. Bomber crews gather! Following the Yellow River, change to combat formation at this point. At which point change course to 180 degrees to reach the target. Formation drop on me. Set bomb drop interval 50 meters. Turn left after bombing. Fighter escort joins the bombers over Xi'an. Altitude 4500. Same course as the bomber squadron. Arrival at Xi'an 8:30. Fighters must protect the bombers. That's all. Fighting positions! Fighting positions! Takemura, the right tank has been hit. Sir, the right tank was hit! Switch tanks. Radio, signal 8:30 all bombs on target. Nara's plane hit in right tank by enemy bullets. Attempting to rejoin the formation. Squadron Leader! Osaki! Takemura! Kinoshita! Osugi! Osaki! Osaki! It's Sato. It's Sato. It's Sato. Squadron Leader! Squadron Leader! It is Sato. Sato, any water to drink? The hardest part is always the waiting. Is that so? Inaba... Any news about Nara's plane? I still have heard nothing. Army headquarters says they've had no reports either. Searching but there’s still no trace. Sato was a good man. You could always count on him to have a smile on his face. War is a curious thing. Sometimes it feels like it's me that dead. Yukimoto, I'm sorry. Maybe I talk too much. Yukimoto! It's official, Nara and Sato are dead. “Official”? The Army just delivered the remains of Nara and six others. Mr. Yukimoto, Mr. Yamamura, the Captain wants to see you. Yukimoto reporting as ordered. Yamamura reporting as ordered. Yukimoto, Yamamura.... Sato was admirably killed. Yes, I just heard from Yamamura now. I'm envious of Sato. You were good friends with Sato. Yes, Tanaka and Sato and I were all good friends but now only I remain. Let us have a silent moment for Nara and his crew. I'll talk about Sato's final moment as he was found by Terube's men. Sit there. Nara and Sato's bodies were found four kilometers away from the crash site. Sato was shot in the right temple. It was gracefully self-inflicted. Sato had managed to get the seriously wounded Captain Nara close to friendly territory. But the Captain bled to death from his injuries. Sato was afraid that the dead body of Captain Nara would be found by the enemy. Sato's left hand was injured in the crash. So he dug a hole for Captain Nara with just his right hand. After he buried Captain Nara, he decided to die honorably. Sato's bloody fingertip was still on the trigger. Our land forces found them some time later. I was surprised when I heard this story. I know it may not sound like it but this is a time of celebration. They are having a celebration in paradise. The two of them are at rest. Sato was a fool for dying like that! Yamamura, I'm the last one left now. I know how important this was to him. I’ll do the same too when the time comes. ♪ Evening sky without clouds. The autumn wind is blowing. ♪ Moonlight falling and crickets trilling. ♪ How far away is my native sky? ♪ Oh, my mother and father. How are they doing? Is crying about Sato helping? Sato will never die as long as you remember him. That is life and death. We are born again when we become soldiers and dedicate our lives to the nation. Understand? Yes, I understand. According to intelligence, about 30 fighters moved into the area last night at 20:00. Our squadron is on alert. We'll be looking for enemy aircraft in our patrol area. We shoot down every enemy plane we can find. 06:00 departure 07:30 - Reach our assigned patrol area. Altitude - 3000 meters. Don't take unnecessary chances. Stick together and hit the enemy hard. That is all. Inaba, our team is ready to leave. Good hunting. Yes, I'm sure we will. 2nd formation - 4 enemy planes shot down. All aircraft returned. 3rd formation - 5 enemy planes shot down. All aircraft returned. 4th formation - 4 enemy planes shot down. Yukimoto's plane has not returned. 5th formation - 3 enemy planes shot down. All aircraft returned. 6th formation - 4 enemy planes shot down. All aircraft returned. Does anyone know what happened to Yukimoto? We had just driven off a fourth enemy formation. We then attacked the enemy's fifth formation. Sergeant Yukimoto shot down two enemy planes. I saw his plane get jumped by other enemy aircraft and he dived toward the ground. I lost track of him after that. This is Captain Yamamoto. They just got back. 07:30 - Engage with 30 enemy fighters 24 enemy shot down. Yukimoto's plane is missing. Sir, let us initiate a search. I think he made another crash landing somewhere. Yukimoto is not a man easily shot down by the enemy. I also don't think Yukimoto is a man who is easily shot down by the enemy. 30 minutes of fuel left. Wait. Yes, sir. Wait. Yamamura. Calm down. Panic doesn't help. Can we fly now? Captain Yamamoto, do you want to go along? Sir, I see an airplane! Prepare a stretcher! Yamamura, release the harness! Yukimoto! Okubo, prepare for blood transfusion. Yukimoto, Yukimoto. Your wounds are shallow. Yamamura or the Captain? I'm here, Yukimoto. Sir... I’m sorry for being stupid. You're not stupid. You made it back. Don't worry about anything. Let us take of you now, okay? Captain, I'm sorry for being stupid. We need a donor for the blood transfusion. Ohashi, I am blood type A. Use my blood. Ohashi, I too am type A. Use my blood. I am type AB. Use my blood. I am type B. Use my blood. I am type A. Use my blood. I am AB type. Use my blood. Find out what type of blood Yukimoto needs. Yukimoto is type O. Ohashi, I am type O. Ohashi, you have to save him. Yukimoto, do you understand me? Sir, I shot down three enemy planes. It was hard but I shot down three enemies. The last one had white, red and green stripes on the fuselage. See if the ground forces can find it. I was almost out of ammunition. I couldn't get a clear shot at him. I turned inside him and finally got him in my sights. I was 800 meters above the ground when I shot him down. Then six enemies dived down on me. I didn't notice them until it was too late. Captain Nara and his crew of six are in paradise. Now, I’m going to meet them. I'm sorry to leave you all. But I have no regrets in my life. Like the commander always says, a combat pilot... ...has dedicated his life to his country. I am ready to die because it is necessary. Don't give up the fight against the enemy. My death is not meaningless. I'm came here unsure of myself. I leave knowing it was worth the sacrifice. Is everyone here now? Yukimoto! Yukimoto! Yukimoto! Yamamura, how many aircraft did you shoot down? Two planes. I also got two aircraft. That is good. Yukimoto, get better soon. You and I will fly together. I'll be your wingman. Sir, I want to talk to Yamamura. Other than Yamamura, everyone go outside. Are you in pain, Yukimoto? Yeah, it hurts. There are some things I want you to do. The bleeding is getting me sleepy. Yamamura, I'm not going to make it. Why do you say that? Your wounds are shallow. You'll heal quickly. I know what's happening to me. Yamamura, after I die, stay strong. I want you to fly my ashes back home. Place them in the hands of my mother with your own hands. You, Nakamura and Sawamura each pick out one of my things to keep for yourself. Everything else, give to my mother. Each time you look at it, you will be reminded of me. Yamamura, I will be with you even in death. The next time you're on alert, I'm flying too. Yukimoto! Yukimoto! Ohashi, Ohashi! Commander! Okubo. Yukimoto, Yukimoto! Say something. Captain Inaba, I was a happy man. Yamamura, raise me up. Nakamura. Imperial Rescript to Soldiers 1. A soldier is loyal. 2. A soldier is polite. 3. A soldier is brave. 4. A soldier is trustworthy. 5.
