I was just thinking, we could have another go around at the Tunnel of Love. - Oh, I'd love to. But, Armon and I have a previous engagement. Now I can't stand him up, that would be very poor bedroom etiquette, don't you think? - Well, hm. I've got an idea. - Hey, no fair telling secrets. - Oh, I'm sure Ronda would go for that. - Go for what? - A little game. How about it, love? What do you say we do a little bit of role reversal in the bedroom, hm? - Depends on the role. (laughing) (knocking) Come in. - Good day Ronda. I'm Sally Landers, the down under bush doctor. And this is my head nurse, Armon Deana. - At your service, Ronda. We're here to help you. - What seems to be the problem, dear? Where do you hurt? - Right here. - Oh? Hm. Well, let's just see if we can pinpoint the problem. Oh no. - What is it bush doctor Sally? - Oh. I'm afraid we're going to have to give the patient a thorough examination. What do you think, head nurse Armon Deana? - Yes, absolutely, I think we should rush the patient to the intensive care right away. - Undress the patient and prepare for the operation. - Yes, sir. I mean, ma'am. - It's miss to you, head nurse Armon Deana. - [Armon] Ah yes, kemo Sally. Oh, I mean, bush doctorness. Oh forgive me please forgive me. It was a pure slip in my tongue. - Your punishment will come later. - Oh god, there's nothing to mix this with. - [Woman] Oh, that's why I always bring spud. - Spud? - Spud.
