(thumping) Are you crazy? Why're you doin' this, chief? Where are you going, little fish? Hah! You can't swim faster than them. (on phone:) professor mckray, this is peter jackaray. I finished grading your finals from marine bio 251. Do you want to review them, or should i just post the grades? Lemme know. Bye. Yeah, steven. Jim bookman here. Listen, it's all set for freeport, i'll see you in... steven, it's marc desantis. I know we haven't talked in a while but i really need your help. I'm still in africa with miles craven and i've got a problem. I can't get into it now, but i'll send you an e-mail tonight. Lemme know what you think. The number you have reached is not in service at this time. Holy cow. This is big, jim. Jim: You've already committed to freeport for the summer. Steven: Yeah, this is bigger than freeport. Jim: What about your dissertation? You can't keep putting it off. Steven: Freeport's not goin' anywhere... and my dissertation can wait. Twelve confirmed shark attacks in three months. Steven! Three months! That's more than australia's had in five years. Sharks don't behave that way. We don't have the money to send a team. I'll go alone. I can stay with marc desantis. He still workin' with miles craven? Yeah. I don't know. Steven: Tell the board it'll be great publicity for the university. I'll get it published in all the major journals. Who said publish or perish? Jim: We're talkin' journal of marine biology? Steven: Guaranteed. All right, go. God knows where i'll find the money. - Oh, great! You won't regret this. - I probably will. Ah, good morning, mr. Blacktip. Let's see how your liver is today. Whew. Tanka, a little help, please. Okay. Let's see here. Ugh... oh my god. Tanka, call the police. Yes, doctor craven. Right away. Man 1: If there are no fish to catch, i cannot sell fish. Man 2: You don't have my money. Man 1: You've got to give me some more time, man. Man 2: Jan, i've been carrying you for six months now... my creditors won't wait. I'm sorry. Now get your personal stuff off. Hi. Hello. Welcome to port amanzi, i'm lawrence rhodes, i own the hotel. Hi. I'm... steven mckray. Yes, i got your fax. Marine biologist, eh? Well, dr. Craven can certainly use your help. - Oh, you know miles? - Quite well. Actually, my wife was quite instrumental in convincing him to establish a center here in the first place. So, uh, how come they're not out fishin'? Well, it's the damn sharks. Been goin' on for months now, screwing up the economy of the whole town. Everyone is struggling. Steven: Looks like the town's been hit pretty hard. Took our tourist business straight to hell. We've been forced to foreclose on several properties. I thought you said you own the hotel. I do. I'm a financier of sorts. Unfortunately now with a bunch of boarded up shops. Where the hell is that damn driver? (tires screech) Hello. - I'm sorry i'm late. - As usual. This is mani. He'll take care of you. Well, good luck. We're all behind you. Thank you, mr. Rhodes. First class service, huh! Only the best. Okay. To the hotel? No, i need to make a stop first. No problem. As long as it's on the meter, i'm able. The marine research center. Great. I'm not in that much of a hurry. No problem. How long has the fishing been bad? I haven't been out in three months. Now, i have to earn a living, or else i must sell my boat. So, i drive a taxi. Mani: And you? I'm visiting some old friends and studying the shark attacks. Oh really, just what we need. Another scientist. Why do you say that? Nothing but trouble. Ever since they opened that research center, nothing but trouble. The fishermen, they blame the scientists for the poor fishing and for the shark attacks. Is a bad situation for everyone. And what do you think? Me? I just want to fish. (door buzzer) What the hell are you doing here? - I rang the bell. - You're trespassing. I'm looking for marc desantis, i'm a friend of dr. Craven's. Why didn't you say so? Don't remember you asking. Come on. Steven mckray. Or is it dr. Mckray, finally? No, i still haven't been able to finish that dissertation yet, miles. Just keep plugging away, you'll get it. Steven: You know i will. So what do you think? Pretty impressive. Quite a change from the university labs, don't you think? Yeah. Oh, we get by. Yes, steven, you always get by. It's a shame you didn't make it in time for the services. Corine has been taking it quite hard. Corine? What's she doin' in africa? I'm sorry, you didn't know. Know what? Where's marc? Marc's dead, steven. What? No. How did it... i found what remained of him... in the stomach of a blacktip. What happened? I don't know for sure. He finished work. Went to his boat and i assume he went diving, got attacked by a more aggressive species, a mako or a tiger. I think the blacktip smelled the blood and came running. Jesus, miles. Marc. Well i'm sorry. I know you two were close. I don't... i don't understand these attacks. I've never heard of anything like this. Well we have been experiencing some severe red tides lately. The fish have all died. The food supply is depleted. The sharks are literally going right up to the beach in search for food. In situations like this attacks are inevitable. The fishermen are blaming you. Oh please. Yes, of course they're blaming me, they blame me for everything. They've been nothing but a pain in the ass to me. Three break-ins. Vandalism. They even stole some of my equipment. Dr. Craven, sorry to disturb you, but, we have a delivery. Well, miles, you're busy. Where's corine? If the sandlopers can catch sharks and sell them to the marine center, why can't i? Because, the koisan only fish on their tribal land. And outside the tribal trust area sharks are protected by law. To hell with the law. My family should starve because of some law? No fish, only sharks, since those americans showed up. Nothing but sharks. Corine? Well, if it isn't steven mckray. Mr. Big time shark expert. Come to pay your respects? Well you're a little late, services were yesterday. - Corine, i... - not enough left of him to bury. Just this... i gave it to him when we graduated. I'm sorry about marc. You should be sorry. All those damn expeditions you dragged him on, all around the world, wherever you two could find some sharks. Yeah, he... he loved his field work. He didn't want to be stuck in some lab like... like me? Is that what you were gonna say? Look where it got him. Hey, americans. This bar is for fishermen only. Did i miss the sign? We don't need one, everybody knows. Look, we're not bothering anyone. You are bothering me, you and all the other foreigners that come here and mess up my town. Oh, so now it's your town, too. Tell him to sleep it off. I can take care of myself, y'know? Yea, i know. What the hell are you doin' down here anyway? Marc called. He asked for my help. Your help? Well he sure as hell doesn't need it anymore. I'm sorry... you were my brother's friend. I was out of line. What'd he call you about? I don't know. He sent me an e-mail which somehow got screwed up. I was hopin' it was still on his computer. I haven't been to the boat yet. Not sober, anyway. Come on. No computer. This is a picture of us in the bahamas last year. He always loved it there. You okay? We can leave if you want to. I'm gonna be fine. Look... marc's dive watch. Yeah. He bought this in the dry tortugas. But miles said that when they found his... he was wearing this on his wrist. If he would've been diving he would've been wearing this. Where'd they find the boat? Miles said it washed up on the beach and they towed it here. Corine: What're you doing? Steven: I'm gonna find out where she's been. The satellite continually tracks your position. Let's just hope he saved the locations of his dive sites. He did a lot of diving in this area. Corine: Koisi lagoon? Guess i gotta make a dive. Fine. When do we go? We? Steven: Forget about it. You're not diving. Corine: Gimme a break. You know i'm certified. Steven: You don't have any experience around sharks. Corine: Aren't you the one that always says never dive alone? Steven: This can be dangerous, all right? I don't have time to be babysitting you underwater. Spare me the macho act. I'm not some club med bimbo with a snorkel. That's not what i meant. Bullshit. You're not diving. End of story. Fine. I'll go to the beach and work on my tan like a good little girl. Hey! Americans! Look, we don't want any trouble. So what are you doing on my dock? I guess you own everything around here, huh? Help! Help! Shark! Don't splash. Relax! Don't splash! The shark will attack! Don't splash! Get him to the dock! Swim, boy, swim! Bloody shark. Yeah. Bloody shark. You did good out there. Yeah, you too. You okay? Sure. C'mon, i'll buy you dinner. How about a drink? Ahh, the hero the whole town's talking about. So, where are you off to this morning? Koisi lagoon. I see. Investigating our little shark problem, are we? I'm doin' what i can. Which is? I'm gonna get a close look at these sharks. On my terms. Sounds dangerous. Well it is. They're out of control, steven. Well i'll be careful. Please do. By the way, my wife insisted that i invite you and miss desantis to join us for dinner tomorrow night. Sounds great. Thanks. Dr. Craven will also be joining us. Yes, his wife loves to hear me expound on my theories. Well you're certainly full of theories. I'll tell corine. I've... already invited her. Good luck. Koisi lagoon, huh? Very many sandbars. Very many shipwrecks. Very hard to navigate. And i'm sure you'd know of a guide whose rates are very reasonable. I do. One that has very fast boat. Steven, what's that? Field generator. Creates an electrical barrier that repels sharks. Does it work? It better. I built it. Fin stick. Boom. Not a very nice way to catch a fish. What're those totems? The koisan, this is their land since forever. And the shark carvings? To remind fishermen that only the koisan have to right to catch sharks. Steven, look! Steven: I thought we had an agreement. Corine: I changed my mind. There's sharks. It's too dangerous! See you at the bottom. Independent woman, huh? Tell me about it. (shouting in foreign language) They came for a visit. What're they saying? You're not supposed to be here. They're pissed off. Well i can see that. - Let's go. - Good idea. You okay? I'm a little shook up, i thought those natives were gonna kill us. They're very protective of their area. Do you think marc had a run-in with them? Uh, he knew how to handle himself. Gimme a hand with this. Sure. What was that noise coming from the barrel? We call it a thumper. It's a low-end frequency modulator. What's a thumper doing in that wreck? I don't know, but it sounds like a fish in trouble in the water. Kind of like a dinner bell for sharks. Somebody's going to a lot of trouble to attract sharks to that lagoon. Why would anyone wanna attract them? Good question. Tanka! Let's go. I'll be with you two in a minute. So, how's the research going, steven? Not bad, considering we were almost eaten by a great white. Well you oughta be more careful. That thing went through a field generator like it wasn't even there. He was always one to take unnecessary risks. I wasn't taking any risks. And what's a thumper doing on the bottom of koisi lagoon? Marc put it there. It was our way to deal with the shark problem. He thought that we could corral them using sound waves. - It works. - Yes it does. Unfortunately, the range is limited. So my brother spent a lot of time in that lagoon. Yes, indeed he did. We just had a run-in with the koisan. I thought they were gonna kill us. Well they are very protective of their sharks, and technically you were trespassing. I don't think marc's death was an accident. So you think he was murdered... by the koisan? Oh no no, they're not the type to resort to violence. Well they sure as hell looked like they were capable of it. Look, i have an arrangement with them. I pay them top dollar for the sharks, and in return they leave me and my staff alone. If marc did meet with foul play, i assure you it was not the koisan. They knew him. They would never hurt him. It's just a few tests i'm running. It's nothing interesting. - But now, i... - you have to get back to work. Back to work. So you know the way out. - Yeah. We'll talk to you soon. - Anytime. Anytime. Corine: That was a quick brush-off. What do you think he's hiding? Steven: Miles has always been sensitive about his work. Hey. Back to the harbor? Steven: No, i wanna get another look at those sharks. Corine: At koisi lagoon, are you crazy? Steven: I'm gonna get a blood sample and test it. The koisan will not be happy to see us. Then we won't let 'em see us. I think i'm gonna throw up. Hey, it's like filet mignon for sharks. They love it. Filet mignon, huh? Good thing i'm a vegetarian. Takes patience to be a fisherman, huh? Gotcha! Yepa! Now what? Do we drag him back to the dock? No, we're gonna wait for him to tire himself out, and then we're gonna haul him up on deck. Excuse me? You're going to bring a live shark aboard my boat? Don't worry, we'll tranquilize it. It'll be sleepin' like a baby. Steven... steven! - Hold his tail! - Are you mad! Just do it. Corine, more tranquilizer! This is not sleeping like a baby! Corine, tranquilizer! It's not working. It takes a few seconds to get to the nervous system. - Corine! - I'm spraying, i'm spraying. Look out! Corine, look out! Thanks. No problem. Not a very sporting way to kill a fish. Nice. Oh, i'll never get the stink out of my boat. Oh, it's not that bad. The hell it isn't. Look at this. The liver's deformed. Yeah, so that's what miles was so secretive about back at the lab. - Just what i thought. - Encephalitis. Excuse me? Inflammation of the brain. The cerebrum and the cerebellum are completely swollen. Do either of you guys speak english? It's brain is fried. It must've reverted to primal instinct, hunt and eat. But that's what they do anyway. No, they only eat when they're hungry. This thing thinks it's always hungry. No wonder it swam through that electrical field. It's brain was so overloaded it didn't even feel it. Now what're you gonna do? - Take a blood sample, test it. - Tonight? No, we'll wait till tomorrow morning. What's he saying? He wants the shark. He says if we give him the shark, we won't tell the police. Well, let him have it. I thought craven had an arrangement with them. I guess we're not part of the staff. Please, mr. Rhodes. With my boy's medical expenses, things are tough, you know what it's like. Another month. What could you want with my dive shop? I don't want your shop. Just the money that you owe me. Another month, please. Business is better. These americans are renting equipment. We even took out some crazy tourist this morning. All right, mabunda, a little more time, but that's it. Buy your son something, from me and my wife. Thank you, thank you mr. Rhodes. Good morning. More problems? Well, it gets worse everyday. Don't you lose money if the shops close? Yes, but i lose even more if they stay open. You're his first customer in a month. Simple economics. I guess. But it's too bad. Yes, it's too bad. So, any... solution to our shark problem? No, not yet. But we're working on it. Well, i won't keep you. Morning. Sorry i'm late. Hey, take a look at this. Wow... the cell activity is three times faster than it should be. Corine: The metabolic rate is stuck in overdrive. Take a look at this one. Oooh... what's that in the cell? Some kind of hormone. I don't think it should be there. I'll do a culture on it. I'll tell you exactly what it is in twenty-four hours. I wonder if miles knows anything about this? Well you can bet i'm gonna ask him. There's cabo and his crazy tourists. (screaming) Gimme your belt. You're gonna be okay. Don't worry. Take us back to shore! You're gonna be okay. You're quiet. You're still thinking about that woman, aren't you? She's gonna lose her leg. Four shark attacks in less than a week. Rhodes: You dissected it, right on the boat? Corine: Yes we did. The organs were enlarged beyond belief. I've never seen a metabolic rate that high. Miles: Three times the normal rate, as a matter of fact. You mean the sharks are growing too fast? Uh, no, that's not what i mean at all, mrs. Rhodes. It's has to do more with the functioning... or shall i say malfunctioning of the internal system. Hold on... i'm not following you. How shall i explain this? Just think of a shark system as an engine. If you drive it too fast and too hard it'll burn out. Yes, but the sharks aren't dying. No, but, they're driving themselves into a frenzy. Can you stop it? Not until we know what's causing it. Well, what do you think it is? We found something strange in the blood. Really? What is it? A hormone. You found it too, miles. Oh yes, of course. So what is it? At this point i'm not sure. But it's my theory that it's what's causing these sharks' abnormal behavior. You said that it was because the red tide depleted their food supply. Yes, that's exactly what i said, steven. But if that's the case, why wouldn't they go further out to sea to feed? What's attracting them to the bay? Touch?. You both made for an excellent scientific debate. Yes, steven has always enjoyed testing me. You've always enjoyed it more, miles. Yes, well i think you'll both enjoy a cup of coffee and a fine cigar. - Have one. - Thank you. Rhodes: How about you, sir? You were in rare form tonight. Miles, what are you really doing here? What do you mean by that, exactly? Well, whoever's footing the bill for your marine center isn't paying you to study toxins and algae. Just like the good old days. I forgot how well you knew me. Why don't you follow me to the center? I have something to show you. Miles: So what do you see? Corine: The cell walls are punctured. Metastasis has set in. It's cancer. Now... what do you see? Miles: Same batch of cells, exactly thirty days later. Wow... the cells are healthy. Complete remission. - I don't believe it. - Oh believe it, steven, believe it. You know sharks have incredible immune systems, completely resilient to any form of disease, including cancer. You've talked about sharks being a cure for cancer for years. It doesn't work. Oh, but it does. I just needed to go in a more radical direction. Which is what? I'm done talking for now. Let's just say it works. Complete remission in 98 percent of my cases. You've conducted animal trials, double-blind testing, laboratory control groups? Those are details, steven, details. Why're you always so concerned with details? Why don't you two come with me to the clinic? I'll let the results speak for themselves. Oh, doctor craven, please come in. Hello mabunda. Tadeese, i brought you a gift. Dr. Craven. How's he doing? Everything checks out. Good. That's good. Two months ago... tadeese came to me with terminal ulcerating basil cell carcinoma. When i first saw him he was so weak, he could barely raise his head. Quite a recovery, don't you think? - He looks fine. - The cancer is gone. Yes it is, mabunda. You gave him the drug. Amazing, isn't it? My boy was so sick, and no one helped until dr. Craven. I owe him everything. It's my pleasure, mabunda. - We should let him rest. - Goodnight. Convinced, steven? That's the most irresponsible thing i've ever seen. What're you talking about? You gave that boy an unproven experimental drug. - But he saved the boy's life. - That's not the point. That's exactly the point. My drug works. Oh, and that gives you the right to use him as a guinea pig? He's a child, for christ's sake. And i gave him a chance to live. Without me, what chance would he have had? None. - You would've done the same. - The hell i would have! I'm disappointed in you, steven. You, of all people, should appreciate what i'm trying to do. Now i know why you came here. There's no one to stop you from playing god. Details. Steven! Steven, wait. You're not leaving without me. Look, you know the numbers. Over 80 percent of cancer patients try alternative medicine. This isn't about giving someone herbal treatment and hoping for the best. He came to a developing country so the fda can't look over his shoulder. Look. We can't go on like this, because those people are sick. - It's happened before. - Oh, really, has it? (arguing) Just relax. So how long have you and miles been playing king of the hill? Miles always spent more time applying for grants than being in a lab. He's real good at finding desperate people willing to spend money to cure what ails them. He's always been more interested in what science can do for him, and his bank account, than science. Well, this is me. Okay. Goodnight. Steven... marc had great respect for you, as a scientist. And as a man. He was a great judge of character. Goodnight. (thumping) (thumping) There's another thumper. Take us closer to the beach mani, about fifty yards. You got it. God, this tar is everywhere. Steven: Yeah, it is. Thumpers and sharks, too. (thumping) What happened? I don't know. I was trying to keep my eye on you... and, bop! Are you all right? Good thing us boaters have got hard heads. Corine: That culture from the shark's blood'll be ready in a minute. What're you thinking about? I don't understand why miles put thumpers right next to the beach. Do you really think he did it? - I'm gonna find out. - Right after we talk to the police. Let's see what i have first. It's a synthetic growth hormone. A steroid of some sort. Definitely a prime suspect. So much for the red tide theory. So how do you think the hormone's getting into the sharks? Miles. He must have needed to accelerate the sharks' metabolism to produce his drug. No wonder he didn't want us pokin' around. Steven, if this steroid is screwing up the sharks... what do you think it's doin' to that boy? We should go check his chart. I'll just be a minute. I'm gonna clean up. Okay, hurry up. Time to wake up, man. Steven: Are you okay? Corine: My head hurts. (screaming) When we hit the water, dive for the wreck, don't stop kicking. Take a deep breath! Thank you. Now what? We follow the river back to town and then talk to the police. Mr. Rhodes. Okay... thank you. They're on their way. Why would they want my slides? They stole the thumpers, too. Somebody doesn't want us to... (knocking) - Who is it? - Lawrence rhodes. Are you all right? The desk clerk said that... two guys just tried to kill us. My god! Really? Who were they? I don't know. I've seen them around. I think they were fishermen. - Well, we should call the police. - I just did that. Good. I'll tell you what, why don't you wait in my office? I'll make some coffee for you. That would be great. Good. I'll just be a minute. Wait! Where're you going? Come on! Stop! Stop! Mani! - We need your help! - Big time! You're in trouble. Charlie, take the woods trail. Freddy, shumba, cut them off at wharf street. Yepa! Now i'm a criminal too. We have to talk to the provincial authorities. It's our word against miles'. And the police. If you go to the provincial authorities... you'll need proof. There goes my rear window! We can't just walk in and ask for it. Steven: You got that right. Lose these guys and let's go get our proof. (honkning) Corine: What do you expect to find in the clinic? Charts. (buzzing) Pancreatic cancer, showed marked improvement after initial treatment, but, uh, he crashed two weeks later. Steven. Can you help him? I'm sorry, mabunda, there's nothin' i can do. There's nothing anyone can do. He got so sick, so fast. Why won't dr. Craven come? I'm sorry, mabunda. How could miles do this? So what if he kills a dozen people, or us for that matter? If he finds a cure they'll probably give him the nobel prize. Okay, it's secured. All right... we're gonna be out in ten minutes. Keep the vaga bunda running... we may need to get out of here in a hurry. Are you sure we got the only shark? I hope so. See if there's anything in the journals. Here's a list of the intensive care patients, their medical history, progress and failures. There's nothin' over here. Go check out the lab. That son of a bitch knows it doesn't work. (touchtone dialing) Don't move! Oh please, mr. Hacker, there's no need for guns. Where's corine? I wanted to keep her out of this. Oh, how noble. I take it you found what you're looking for. More than i wanted to. You killed mabunda's little boy. Oooh, that's such a strong word, don't you think, steven? - Your drug doesn't work, miles. - Oh, but it does, it buys them a few weeks without pain, and when we perfect it, it'll buy them a lifetime. And you'll make millions of dollars. That's not the point, steven! You're always missing the point! Do you think jonas salk invented the polio vaccine for free? No. There's a difference here. His works. Mine will too. In time. You call yourself a scientist, a doctor...! You're a psychopath. Is that what happened? Marc found out what you were doing here and you had the police kill him? What are you talking about? I had nothing to do with marc's death, he was a colleague of mine. The disk. Where's the disk, steven? That was pointless. Get up!! Close the damn gate. Hurry! Hurry up. Welcome back. Mani, the boat! - Where's corine? - Miles has her. Well, let's go get her! - They have a gun! - Oh man, what are we gonna do? Get the fuck outta here! Okay. They're heading west. Cut 'em off. Steven: Hold on! Can't you go any faster? No. - We're gonna get creamed. - You're right. Steven: He's out of bullets! Reload, reload quickly. Slow down! Steven! The rocks! You okay? Yeah. Steven... nice move. Yeah, sure. (ringing) Yes. Ah, steven. Well it's about time you called. You have something i want, and... i have something you want. I'm suggesting a trade. Two o'clock. The center. Oh, and steven...? Be smart. So? He wants to trade corine for the disk. I'm gonna meet him at his lab this afternoon. Alone. Alone? No way, man, steven? You and me, man, we're in this together. No, i dragged you in far enough. Oh yeah, steven. (speaking foreign language) That means, what's done is done. Besides which, you need me to watch your back. I appreciate the offer, but this is my problem. You think they're gonna let you just walk out of there? I'll think of something. Me? I got plan. It's the police! Go back! Steven: What the hell? - Mr. Rhodes. - What's he doing here? He must be working with miles. Wait a minute. You can't go in there! My boss will kill me if he finds out. Okay, okay, take it easy now. Relax. No problem, no problem. Steven. Girl: What're you doing? That's locked...! I'm calling mr. Rhodes. Keep her company. We're gonna find help here? That's right. Attention. Everybody please listen. Freddy and shumba are dead. They said you did it. What do you want here? I want to be fishing again. I want our children to grow up healthy and strong, to swim in the water again. I want you to have your boat back. We want this town to prosper. I want you out of here. Your people are dying and i know why. Wait. Let him speak. Well, steven mckray, start talking. Oil. The problem is oil. Let's go. Corine! No! Corine! Don't bother, there's nowhere for them to go. You okay? Oh, how touching. That's some plan you got there. Yes, it is. Completely fucking twisted. Oh. What's going on? Lawrence here is selling out to an oil company that just struck gold right off the harbor. And guess who benefits? Whoever owns the port. Very good! You two make a great team, you know that? Your escaping the sharks in the lagoon was quite a feat. It's too bad your brother didn't fare as well. Miles, how could you be a part of this? I have no idea what this is all about. Lawrence barges in here with the police chief and these goons. Don't play innocent. You planted thumpers by the beach, right where people were swimming. - It's not true. - How much is he paying you, miles? Paying him? My god. My wife's little indulgence. Frankly, i wouldn't put a dime into this phony science project. So you're the one who stole my thumpers. I gave 'em to him... and he used 'em to kill the tourist business. Yes. Literally. Simple economics. The more sharks, the less people. I got lucky twice. First your crazy sharks ate all the fish and killed the fishing, now that was beautiful, but when hacker told me about your little thumpers, well, that was simply divine. So how many more foreclosures do you need until you own the port? Well, as of yesterday, i own the whole town. Are you sure about that? (beeping) There's the signal. This has been quite entertaining, but i'm afraid it's time for you all to die. Kill them. Burn the whole place down. Santa maria! Don't disappoint me this time. You okay, mani? Steven! Steven! Steven! I enjoyed feeding your brother to the sharks. You see? I wasn't such a bad guy. I know. Come on, let's go! I know. Gimme your hand. Gimme your hand. Hey now, you, you drive like a madman! - I drive like a madman? - Very scary. Corine: Now you know how it feels. Mani: I'd help you carry, but... steven: Yeah, i know, you're not a taxi driver anymore. Mani: That's right. Hey, americans, you come down here and make a mess and now you leave. Don't worry, i'll be back. I'm gonna bring a whole team of experts - to help me with these sharks. - More americans, great! What're you worried about? You're gonna make a fortune sellin' your boatslip to the oil companies. Now that mrs. Rhodes extended my loan, i don't think i'm gonna sell. Good for you. Goodbye, sir, goodbye, ma'am. - Bye bye. - Take care. So how're you gonna get the university to fund the team? I'll videotape everything. Bookman can sell it to the discovery channel. - Oh, he'll love that. - Hey, i'm great with a video camera. Thanks for everything, mani. No problem. Arivederci. Steven. Remember, i'm your captain, huh? Like you'd let me forget? So, you haven't told me where you're headed off to. Oh, i was thinkin' i'd get into some field work. Really? Yeah, i heard they're gearin' up a team to go to africa, something to do with sharks. I was wondering if i could get a recommendation? I think i could arrange that. (bell clanging)
