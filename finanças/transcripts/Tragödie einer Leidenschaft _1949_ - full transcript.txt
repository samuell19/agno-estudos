TRAGEDY OF A PASSION based on the novel by: subtitles by: RAREFILMSANDMOREIZOM (Copyright 2015; All Rights Reserved) Well? Thank you, Excellency. Still into music? No, into Pawlin. Ah, into Pawlin. Don't be angry with me, Excellency, if I bother you again with this case but today you have to listen to me. Whenever you'd like, my friend. But not now, in the middle of a concert. Why don't you visit me tomorrow? - No, it has to be now. Music frees the mind. Today you might understand more of what you're not familiar with. Sergej lvanovitsch, you might be a successful writer now but before that, you were a lawyer. You know full well it's impossible to grant your request. This man can't be pardoned. According to his files, he's a brutal and cold-blooded murderer. My God, what can files really tell you? They name the deed enumerate the lapses and say nothing about the rest. I witnessed how the deed was done. And had a coincidence not stopped me I could've been the one who did this. And then I had to be his judge and sentence him. Life imprisonment! It was murder. And still this man is anything else but a murderer. You'll change your mind after I've told you how it came to this How it all happened. It was the first time I acted as a judge in Tergenow. You don't know the place. It's a small city in the Urals. I was living in an old house and for a time, a young couple rented an apartment there, which raised my interest for some reason. If I say "for some reason", I mean especially regarding the woman. Dodja! What is it? You know, I don't like being alone. Some days later, I got to know the man. He lost again. It's clear to me what the game was about. And what was it? Not about money; he's got nothing. He was kicked out of his regiment because of his debts. That's why he had to leave the capital. What did I say wrong? Just look at this old man! He could never afford to do so otherwise Come on! Leaving so soon? - I think it's disgusting! Good evening. - Good evening. We know each other! Don't you want to have a seat with us? Pardon? Fair enough, if you don't remember me. You seemed to be more interested in my wife. What do you mean by that? I'm not touchy. In the provinces, you have to get used to many things. It would be nice if you joined us. It's not that late. Thanks but I must leave. Coming? - Yes. Please stay! - Oh, thank you. It was the same night, some hours later. I had just come home. Yes. Excuse my interruption. You just came home, didn't you'? Yes. And you met nobody when you entered the building? No. But now it seems to me, there was someone standing there. Well, I hope you're not angry with me because of tonight. Would you do me a favor'? But of course! Could you maybe come upstairs with me? Sergej lvanovitsch works for the local court. I would like to hear his opinion. Do you think a person, for whom a death certificate was issued could still be alive? That's a strange question. Municipality of Ostronov, Pawlin Pimonow, about 50 years old. Of course, it's possible that a tramp was buried and nobody scrutinized his papers. Smaller communities often don't take that very seriously. However, if a death certificate was written for someone, then that person usually is dead. Smaller communities don't take that very seriously. Is he alive? Was it him? He was already after us in Kazan! And in Saratov! That's why you refused to accept that invitation! Now I understand! I'll never go there! You can ask me to do whatever you like, but not that! You'll do as I told you! He should come! He should come, if there's something he wants. With your permission, I'll go now. Of course. Sergei! It's the best thing that could've happened! You won't believe it. The governor's vehicle is outside. What? Yes! He's expecting her at his place tonight. Now tell me again, that I don't understand human nature! I knew it from the start! The game was all about the woman You're here to take her to him? Yes, she's waiting. After you left us, the governor invited her. And she well, to be exact, her husband accepted the invitation for her. You find yourself very interesting, don't you? Sergei, that's enough to gossip about for at least half a year! Yes, gossiping and spying. That's all you do here. Dragging everyone through the mud. We're talking about a human being, but that doesn't bother you, does it? It's his business. And who's talking about him? I despise him And what about her'? Do you know whether she really feels uncom- fortable about all of this? Can't you see that this woman's little finger is worth more than all of yours put together'? And that she's dealing with this with so much more superiority and pride? How all this dirt just drips off of her and doesn't even touch her'? It only makes her more beautiful. That's wonderful. Sergei, you're in love! I've never seen you like this before Tomorrow, you will know all about your darling. The governor always has to tell the story down to the last detail. At his age, there seems to be more pleasure talking about it than actually taking part in it. No! Never! Please help! Sergei! Sasha, come and help me! Sergei! I'm going upstairs. Feel better now'? Where is he? Her husband's upstairs. That was no dream. Suddenly, he was standing right in front of me What am I doing here? You came running out onto the street. Yes. The street. That face. I never saw him like that before! Whom? Whom are you talking about? We must find him! Hurry! Please go! There'll be a disaster otherwise Sergei! I'll be back soon! Stay here! Dead! Murder! Sergei, were you in this room just a short while ago? Her husband's been murdered. What do you know about that? I know nothing. They'll ask you as well, whether you know anything. Go and do what's necessary! You must tell us everything. It'll do no one good, if you keep something from us Yes, I will tell you everything. And then you can help him. That's how I learned her story. She was only a child when her father died. Totally impoverished, she came to the capital with her mother. Here, mother? - Yes, my dear. It'd be better to pay! Put onto the street because of two Rubles? Don't come near me! Go away! Just go! Yes, you can behave like a big boy now, but you're no better than us. Son of a bitch! Lackey! Yes? I'm Mrs. Verova. I rented an apartment here. Oh yes. Your furniture's arrived. My people will help you. Please, come in! Oh, mom. Lyuba! Lyuba! You must be brave. You're a big girl now, right? We can't live in the countryside anymore. Your mother has to earn money now and she can only do that in the city. You don't have to make this any harder for her. Let's go and make this place real cosy and tidy up a bit! Let's open some of the boxes! You brought nothing with you? Yes, I did. Let's go! Come on! You see this? Tiny mice, hop! One, two, three! Pawlin! Who's Pawlin? Yes? What do you want? The rent, madam. The rent? Why? I haven't even fully arrived yet and you're coming to get the rent? Yes, madam. Our policy is that you pay in advance. Fine, fine. No problem. But we are in the middle of Christmas holidays at the moment. L've got no money with me. You'll have to wait til I go to the bank. I can't do that. Apparently, you're unaware that I'm the cousin of Her Excellency I'm aware of that, madam. And she's the owner of this house. So what do you want? The rent. I told you, you'll have to wait til the holidays are over! If you don't give me the rent now, I'll have my people remove the windows! The windows? Are you mad? What nerve! So you finally arrived. Yes, thank God. The last few weeks were horrible Your estate's been sold? Yes. And what's left? Nothing. Always the same. And now'? Are you going to look for work as a nanny? No, because I'd have to leave my daughter if I did. I'll try to give some classes. You must excuse me for coming here unannounced, Anna lvanova I would've liked to change my dress before making my first call, but to thank you for your kindness, but there was an unforeseen situation. Just a minute ago, I had a fierce argument with your property manager. With Pawlin? - Yes. Because of the rent. So you're not able to pay? Of course, I am! But the money's in the bank. I don't understand why you're so upset about it. It's true, that Pawlin sometimes doesn't say things the right way but all he did was fulfill his duty. You of all people should understand because I made an exception in your case. One normally shouldn't take in impoverished relatives as tenants. They always look for special treatment, which, of course, you can't give them. Dodja! Leave it! Go to your room! Well, my dear, the best thing for you to do is to take care of this little thing problem immediately. The tenants used to give a piece of jewelry as collateral until they were able to pay the rent We'll see one another soon, okay? Au revoir, ma ch√©re! Goodbye. Bye. Mischa, come here! I can't Pa)' Mom, will we go back to the countryside? In the Summer. Lyuba, we will go back to the countryside again in the Summer. But Lyuba's mother never made it to the Summer She wasn't strong enough for the pains and toughness of her work. Dodja! Pawlin! Were you at the funeral? Yes, Excellency! Did you buy a wreath? - Yes. And where's the child? - Here. Why didn't you take her straight away to the orphanage'? I gave you the money. I felt sorry for her. Tomorrow, she's gone! I would like her to stay here. Not in this house! But there's enough room I've already spoken to a woman who will teach her. Later, she might become a tailor and I'll set up a little shop for her Don't you understand me? Then I'll leave with the child. Other people don't have to stay alone as well. L've got nothing to do with her anymore! She's no longer one of my relatives. Understand? By the way, I don't want my son to be with her. Take care of that! From now on, it's only you who's to take care of her. If she stays, this will be her place. Understood? Well! You don't speak French, do you'? Yes, yes, one moment please. Lyuba? Just one moment, please. Yes? - This lady only speaks French. How can I help you, madam? Madam, could you please keep this dress and wig for me until tomorrow? I'll return with my husband. Of course, we will. That's all. Very kind of you. Goodbye. Goodbye, madam. Lyuba, your level of education is very good. And speaking French as a real asset But both are leading you easily to a kind of arrogance you should be very aware of. Of course, madam. Alexei, where's Nikolai? Drunk again? I told you before what would happen to you, if I ever found you drunk again Yeah, yeah. Why do I keep you here? Why'? You fool! You are very late today. Yes, I chose the cloth for the dress Did you find what you were looking for? Yes But it's very expensive: eight rublei! If you like it What do you want? To celebrate It really is beautiful. Very nice. Yes? Kolya! Am I'm allowed to take it? Well, I told you to pick something you'd really like. Thank you very much! So, I can keep it? Hurry, you have to take my measurements! If it's to be finished by Easter, I'll have to start straight away ls he supposed to help you? Take a look at his hands first! Like I said You're right. Madame was very surprised I chose this cloth She, of course, thought it was too noble for me and wanted to know who's giving me expensive gifts And you told her? Yes, of course. She wouldn't calm down. I told her you wanted to look nice when we go to Easter mass. And? Well, she just looked at me and said, "Lyuba Andreovna, I hope "you never forget I only allow decent girls to work for me." I believe she think you're an admirer of mine A hundred and two. Twenty-two. So, now here. No, no, no! Down to the ground! Yes, what is it'? I think there are people outside Someone's outside? Hurry! Now the width of the back. What up with him? ls he angry? Yes, as usual Why do you have to pick on him all the time? He's a good guy. Everybody's good; only I'm a bad guy. How much is it? - Thirty-nine. Now there is someone outside. - Go and have a look! Pawlin! Pawlin! Pawlin! Well? When'? Tomorrow. Yes, leave! Just leave! When tomorrow? Whenever you'd like It's great you're here. Without you, it'd be Hell And you brought the bracelet for me'? Come on! Leave! Go home to mamutschka! Go! To Hell with both of you! Pawlin! Evening, Vladimir Alexandrovitsch. Nikolai! The suitcases! Please, Vladimir Alexandrovitsch. Who's that? Dodja? Dodja! Who was the woman in the car'? The one from Petersburg? So you brought her here! You! I made you come home to put an end to all these affairs. Whom are you talking to? Pawlin? Is that the tone you use with your mother? If you're not thankful for the sacrifices I made then you have no heart and no love What? I did everything to raise you right More than a mothefis supposed to do. And all you think of are your women! What sacrifices have you made? Where were you, mother'? Don't pretend to have done anything out of love! Did you ever try to think how I felt about it all? You sacrificed me! Your vanity, that was what my upbringing was all about. You made a puppet out of me, I had to beg for every single coin. That's why there's never any money - Dodja! Or do you really want to tell me you made me come home only out of love'? I should get married, so fresh money comes in! So stop talking and be happy I accepted my roll in this dirty play! Dodja, ljust want what's best for you! Just leave the room! Holy Mother of God! What are you doing to us with this child? Help us You were a mother, too llS everything alright with him? He brought her here You have marry him off soon! And until then? She costs us a fortune You'll have to look for another one that's not so expensive. Isn't it Lyuba? - Who is Lyuba? The daughter of Anna lvanovna. - Oh yes, Lyuba My, how she's grown! - I used to know your mother very well Well. Isn't she sweet? - Dodja's bride? Shut up, he's crazy! The property manager's daughter. What did she say? She asked me to pick her up from the store next time. I love this old park. Something about you is very familiar, Lyuba. And something about you is very strange. What's strange? A lot. So much that you didn't even recognize me when I opened the door'? You know what I mean? Don't you realize I respect you very much? Lovely! Your laughter is just like in the old days When you laugh like that, you're much more familiar. You agree? If you say so. Tell me something about Petersburg. There's not much to tell. I envy everyone who's able to leave this place. It's horrible to be locked up like this. I know what you mean. Is it very boring here for you? I don't know quite yet. Soon nicer times will come. In a few weeks, it'll be warm; everything will blossom around here. What's going on? Always just half an hour! Always the same way across the park! Going side by side like strangers. Come with me to a place where we can be alone! But where? I know a place. Outside of the city. Only very few people go out there. No. What are you thinking? Do you think I'm like people say I am? Some parts are true, others not. I'm not that flighty, here one woman, there another. I only want one for my own. If I could read your mind Do you like it? It's nice. - Then I give it to you. No. You're crazy! - Maybe. Here! Take it. Goodbye. No! Today I'll go with you. At least until the first houses are visible. Yes. Isn't that Lyuba? Nice to see you, Excellency. L'm so glad we met. Come in! I'd like to tell you something. Oh, there's Dodja,too! Hello. So you're here again? I hope, I'm not disturbing you? Not at all, my dear! I was just about to ask Lyuba if she'd like to visit me one day. Pardon me? Yes. Lyuba, you should know I'm very alone and looking for someone to talk to. What a brilliant idea! Of course, only if you'd like. Very much so! That's nice, my dear. I'm very hflPPY- Thank you, madam. Goodbye, my dear. Goodbye. Are you coming? What did she want from you'? Well, didn't you hear here? She gave me an invitation! Invitation? You don't agree? No, no. I was just wondering why. But it's surely a good thing for you. Why did you invite Lyuba? So she can make your dresses? What do I need dresses for'? Only because of you! Because of you, I have to go to all these affairs Because of you, I've got all these duties. Just buy some new clothes! From what? By the way, he's right. You aren't here to work. But I like to do it. But she's not here because of you either. You can go now. He hasn't been at home for a single night! Only when you come to me does he stay here. Goodnight. No, stay! Dodja's here. I hope you'll come back soon. Fine. Goodbye, my dear. Goodbye, madam. No! Not here! I've been waiting for you so long. I can't wait any longer. Dodja! Now he's gone again. Oh Dodja. L'm very concerned about him. He's gambling and has bad friends. But he's not a bad guy. Vanity- Thinks his place has to be next to that officer. The more frivolous he lives, the more he goes down well with his companions. Lyubuschka, you must help me! Only you are able to do so. He likes you very much. If you just ask him to do something you'd have great influence on him. Come over, my dear, sit down next to me! Am I right? Will you help me? You like him very much,too? Obviously, you'd have to be here all the time. Tell me, my dear, what are your plans for the future? I don't know. My favorite choice would be to enter a monastery. Are you serious? With eyes like yours? Which such beautiful eyes, you can't enter a monastery. You'll get married. Would you like to stay with me forever'? This is the right surroundings for you. My beautiful girl, isn't it? You're right, you're right. I just have to talk to Pawlin first. Come back soon! Yes You're going to madam? Yes, she invited me. What is it? You spend all your time with her. But I can't stay here forever! What will happen when I get married? Are you thinking about getting married? Maybe. Nikolai! Why do you look at me that way? - Why do you care? Drunk again? Of course. Be careful tonight! Understand? Yes, yes, I'll be careful. Pawlin! Yes, Excellency? Is Lyuba here? Yes, Excellency. Should I call her'? NO, it's alright. I wanted to talk to you about her anyway. Pawlin, for the time being, she's become absolutely indispensable to me. Especially for occasions like today's. So I wanted to ask you whether she could stay with me forever. As my companion. No Why not? I'm not quite sure that'd do her any good. And what are you about to do to her'? Lyuba will marry one day. Yes, but only to a man suitable for her. Excuse me, Excellency. You told me once that her place is down here. That's what I was about to say. Why don't you marry her? Me? Well, yes Lyuba wasn't made for me. My God, how clumsy you are! Put yourself together! You're a man! You look quite good. You'll marry her and she'll be my companion! Not bad, huh'? Think about it! What more can I do to melt the ice between us? Do you want to marry me? Marry you? What are you thinking? Well, I guess that's what your mother expects. What my mother expects? You're not serious, are you? How could I ever marry you? You've got nothing. Oh, you think because she invites you? And is very friendly to you? Lyuba, she's the worst person under the sun. Yes, she wants me to get married, but to someone with lots of money. That's what all the fuss today was about. She found a new candidate she can present me to. Do you still have no idea what's going on? I have to, I can't do anything else, even if I'd like to But I don't want anything else. I want to drink and gamble I want to have women! And I want to ruin her. That's what she's made me do And she expects you to be my mistress, because you'll cost her nothing. Lyuba, it doesn't matter whom I marry. We're young, we're in love. I need you. You have to enjoy life, no matter what. Everything else is rubbish. Nice! Very nice! No, I really wouldn't know what to do without you Won't you stay? No. What's wrong with you? Why don't you tell me? You're everything I've got. Why couldn't you be a child forever. I can't be without you anymore. You belong to me. I'll do anything you want me to do. All I want is to make you happy. Will you marry me? Please. Hurrah! We'll celebrate our marriage here! All night long. A wedding! Yes, because she loves me. And I was so afraid Lyuba would leave me. I always thought, I wasn't good enough for her. But it had to turn out this way. Now she's going to be my wife! Lyuba? Yes. Lyubitschka'? Yes That's like an ox and horse getting married to one another! Say that again! - Pawlin! Say it again! - Pawlin! Leave! That's enough! Leave! Pawlin! - Leave! Leave! - Pawlin! We're late, but not too late to wish you all the best. Pawl in! Lyu busch ka! It's a great honor that you and Vladimir Alexandrovitsch came to give your congratulations. Do you mind Oh well! To your health and all the best in the world! To your health, Excellency! Well, now the young shall dance. The old shall watch! No, I really don't have to congratulate you I just have to look at you. Good evening! Will you take a seat, Excellency? Excellency! Friends. I'm just an ordinary man Even if I've always tried to educate myself by reading books. As you see, it took me a while to get married. I didn't do so earlier because of all my duties. I helped my relatives; took care of a child; and spent my money to give her a correct education You don't want to dance? Many people told me it'd be more clever to think of someone's own luck than of someone's duty, because you'll earn no thanks for that. I never thought like that. Why did you come here? And so it happened, that in Lyubotschka I found my wife as well. You see, if you always do the right thing luck will come to you one day. Bravo, Pawlin! Bravo! Pawlin! Pawlin! Pardon? Get my vehicle! Yes, Vladimir Alexandrovitsch. Good morning. Where are you? For days I was sneaking around here like a cat mad for love just looking for you Why do you treat the man who adores you like that? We can meet here, I'll go now. Do you really love me? Are you serious? Sure. Madam? Room 7, please. Room 7 is there. Next time, you can use this door and go upstairs without asking. I'll announce your arrival. Excuse me, my dear, that you had to come here alone. But this idiot didn't tell me to come down. Get me out of here! - What's wrong with you? I want to go Now? When we can finally see each other'? No, I don't want to. I don't want to do this anymore Don't get mad now! I'm not like that. Fine, if madam wants it that way. Not like that! The only reason I can stand it is because of you. All these lies! Why can't you understand? L'm sorry. But I have to deal with my own problems. Now you're reasonable again. You take everything too seriously, Lyuba. All I want is to see you! And this is the best place for it. I want to see you every day. I need that. Is it that wrong to long for the woman you love? Is it wrong to yearn for you? Pawlin! Pawlin! Oh, Pawlin! Come to me! Come to me! Come to me! He has stolen from me! And you'll go to him immediately, yes, immediately! And you'll take the money from him before he can spend it on his whore! And if the money's not back here on the table by tomorrow morning by tomorrow morning, the three of you will go to jail, understand? No. I don't understand, Excellency. Well, you don't understand! The three of you, that's what I said! The three of you! My son stole from me! The whore made him do that. And you, the one she married. What are you waiting for? Don't you know where to find her? Pimp! You buy her dresses and jewelery and then don't know where to find her with that on! To set one thing straight: We're talking about thirty thousand. Thirty thousand rubles! If the money's back by tomorrow morning I will forget all about it. Then you can pack your things and leave with your wife. Sooner or later, both of you will end up in jail You're here? Yes. Are you his mistress? Yes. You! Tell the truth! That 115' the truth. I'm happy you know it now. No. No, you're not that bad. He seduced you. You don't love him. You love me! You've been with him before That's why you married me? Whore! Whore! Whore! Get the horse! That's like an ox and a horse marrying one another! What do you want? You've stolen from your mother What the hell do you think She's going to the police tomorrow. She told you that? There's a way out of this for you. You'll leave this town and take Lyuba with you. She loves you! And you'll tell her you love her, too! And you'll marry her. Then I'll admit to the theft and they'll believe me I will disappear like a dead man. But I will be there forever! Vladimir Alexandrovitsch, you're the only person who can keep her from becoming a bad person. You're the only one who can make her happy. Because she loves you! But if you don't do as I tell you now, I'll be able to sin against you. So he followed them to Kazan to Saratov, to Tergenow this small city in the Urals. And it was here he became a sinner that night. Pawlin! According to his file, as you said, he's a fierce and cold-blooded murderer. He just wanted to keep her from getting bad and unhappy. And he kept her from that I'll do everything I can to help this man.
