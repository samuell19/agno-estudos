[bright music] [gentle music] - Bye. [gentle music] - Can I help you? Yes. We need Mr. Bennett's car right away. - Excuse me. How you doing? [gentle music] - Somebody call for a plumber? - Huh? - Somebody need their pipes cleaned? - Room 1223. - Thanks. - [Man] She's here. - You believe this stool pigeon gets a bride and we can't even order room service? - Hey, he's our star witness. Graham says give him everything he wants. - Yo, Limpy. Your damsel awaits. - [Actor] How do you like that? He slugged me. If you weren't my friend, I'd say you had it coming to you. Why didn't you wait until we had the block surrounded? - I look okay? - She's a hooker, Limpy. You could look like a homemade turd. - Wise guy. - Whoa. Big man. - [Actor] There's an iron hook attached to his forearm and that's his weapon. I saw it and I felt it. [hand knocking] - Get her, rookie. - [Actor] What's the first thing you do when you dial a telephone number? - Somebody need the bed turned down? - [Actor] That's right. You dial the first two letters of the exchange. How do you like that? - You're the client, right? I'd recognize that Sing Sing sunburn anywhere. Come on, sweetheart. Let's go somewhere where we can talk. - Hey babe, I'm with you. - You do cops, baby? - You guys? You guys couldn't afford a handshake. I get champagne, honey. - Yeah. Dom Perry. DP. - Right. [bright music] Yeah, shake it right. That's it. Yeah, shake it. Come on, shake it. [bright music] - [Actor] He uses that hook for everything, doesn't he? [hand knocking] - The door, rookie. The door. [bright music] - Room service. [bright music] - [Limpy] Oh yeah baby, come on. [bright music] - Here you go, my man. Don't say Uncle Sam never did nothing for you. - Thanks. Have a nice evening, gentlemen. - Gun. [guns firing] - Teddy. No, Teddy. - Hey, relax. Rusty ain't mad. But we can't let you talk. Okay? We gotta get you out of here. - He ain't gonna kill me, huh Teddy? - No, man, he ain't gonna kill him. Put your clothes on. - Oh thanks, Teddy. Thanks, Teddy. Thanks. [dramatic music] - Who says acupuncture don't work? [dramatic music] [sirens blaring] - [Valerie] Robbie. - [Man] Is continuing his coverage. - What, Mom? - Bring your homework in so I can check it. - [Man] In a quick bloody rampage, reminiscent of the gangland hits of the 30s, gunmen killed four police officers and an unidentified man in the Hotel Powell late last night. - There's not much to check, Mom. - Put your shoes on, sweetheart. We'll do it on the bus. [gentle music] - How 'bout them four cops getting killed last night? - Yeah. Hey, Lila the babysitter will be bringing Robbie home from school for the next couple of weeks. Make sure she has the key, okay Jimmy. - Sure. - Mom, the bus. Come on. - You'll be working late, Valerie? - I'll be on jury duty. - Jury duty? - All you have to do is concentrate, Rob. If three and three is six, then three and four is-- - Mom? How come there are 12 people on a jury? - Good question. 12 apostles maybe. - I thought when the cops arrested somebody, they just went to jail. - No, you see the police just get somebody they think is guilty, but then there's a trial, and sometimes the jury decides they were wrong. - Cops don't make mistakes, Mom. - Well it's not really a mistake. They let the jury decide. - But you don't know about police stuff. Why are you on the jury? - Young man, it is my painful duty to say these dirty words. - [Both] You'll understand this when you grow up. - Oh Robbie, I don't know what I'd do without you. - Don't embarrass me. - [John] Oh brother. - For God sake, don't let him see that. Come on. - Where were you? - Getting our stories straight. - [Daniel] Okay. Let's see how you did. - John. - Yeah. Well, we got a hooker for Limpy. I mean you said give him anything he wanted, you know. Anyway, they grabbed our girl before she came in. The cops found her in a dumpster at 45th and eighth. It was pretty slick. - I am not interested in their brilliant fucking strategy. Nobody was supposed to know we had this guy. - Come on, Dan. We were seen in Sing Sing talking to Limpy. The state police pulled him out of jail, then we move him and four cops into a suite in a big hotel. We weren't exactly inconspicuous. - I guess we better request the postponement. - Oh yeah, sure. We can just say to the judge please your honor, could you keep this man under indictment 'til we find another witness? Ever hear of due process, asshole? - We've got a ton of physical evidence. 27 expert witnesses. - Can't bore the jury with a lot of forensics, Chris. We need the human factor. Someone to say I saw Rusty Pirone kill 11 people. - Listen to me. I couldn't ask for a postponement even if I wanted to. I don't have to remind you people. This is the biggest goddamn prosecution we've ever pushed out of this office. Big media from the day we busted him. - You have to ID Limpy right away, Stanley? - The media's gonna wanna know who he was, Dan. I can tap dance around it. Put a reverse spin on it. - Any other Pirone people we can squeeze? - We grabbed the four guys from the hit team originally. You know the Jenko brothers, they disappeared before they came to trial. Limpy we know about. And Johnny Red's a lost cause. - You mean Johnny Verona? - Yeah. He's Rusty's uncle. He broke him into the rackets. Brought him right up through the ranks. He told us there was no deal from the jump. Even after we hit him with a 50 year shot, he wouldn't crack. - He's an old style wise guy, Dan. We'll never turn him. [gentle music] Get this on straight. - We haven't got enough. - We'll use what we got. [gentle music] - The match is on, boys. We're gonna sell out today, Phillie. Mark my words. Paul, my sports fan. How you doing? Spell my name right this time, will you. - [Man] Rusty, my man. - I'll give you the authorized version. Mickey. - [Daniel] Look at 'em laughing. They killed Limpy, now they think they're home free. - Dawn, I win this for you. - Let's go. [group chattering] - [Rusty] Mr. Graham. - How you doing, Rusty? You okay? - I'm in control today. Thanks. I had a nice breakfast. Couple of eggs, Canadian bacon. Biscayne diner. - Oh yeah, yeah. I know it. - Geez, I forgot. Another Brooklyn boy here who made good. - [Bailiff] All rise. - Air working? - Full blast, your honor. - Yeah. - [Bailiff] Be seated. - Everybody's here I assume. So, let's proceed with the voir dire. - Okay listen up, people. I'm only going through this once. You will be reimbursed for subway fare only. No cabs, car services, mini buses, rickshaws. Subway fare only. You will be paid $40 a day while you're sitting. Now if you don't get your money, you complain to the cashier at the United States attorney's office. Do not. I repeat, do not come crying to me. - [Jane] [gasps] Oh my god, it's Rusty Pirone. - This must be the big murder trial I've been reading about. - Look at that suit. - So we drop it. Don't want it talked about, especially in front of this mama lu. - What do you think, Susan? - The ladies are all atwitter. They love him. - Women do not respond to this guy. My advice, load up on women. They'll hang him. - Women. - Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Daniel Graham. I'm the prosecutor in the case of the United States of America versus Pirone. This is my co-counsel Eleanor Lyons. Defense counsel will be Leo Greco. Both sides have jury consultants. Mr. Petrie and Ms. Fine. Ladies and gentlemen, the defendant is charged with the controlling and continuing criminal enterprise. He is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and assault with a deadly weapon. The government will prove that Mr. Pirone formed an assassination team from within the Skadoodle crime family to eliminate enemies, government informants, and police officers. And that Mr. Pirone personally participated in the murder of 11 people over a period of three years. We will begin the questioning with Mr. Lawrence Bennett, your honor. [gentle music] - [Man] Next juror, Valerie Alston. - Here. - Good afternoon, Miss Alston. Can you tell us what it is that you do for a living? - I own an antique clothing store downtown. - You married? - Divorced. - You have any children? - I have one son. - Being on a jury in a major organized crime prosecution like this could represent a considerable inconvenience to you. - Yes, it could. - But you're willing to do it anyway. - I guess it's my duty. - Do you know the defendant or anybody connected with him? - No. - She's perfect. - Like putty in our hands. - We accept Miss Alston, your honor. - We applaud Miss Alston's sense of civic duty, your honor. The defense welcomes her to this jury. - [Man] Next juror, Jane Lyle. - I'm back. - Hi, boss. So that's it, you're finished? - They chose me. - [Employee] Oh what an honor. - I'm gonna do it. - You are crazy. - You a single parent. You have a business. They let you out. - It's a duty. You understand? You don't get out. You do it. [gentle music] I distinctly remember you being on a jury, dad. - Oh yeah. That's right, honey. That was a big case, too. Some guy stole the back cove from Hanna's farm. - [Valerie] Yeah well, the principles the same. - Well, I'm sure, but I had your mother. I wasn't a single girl trying to survive in that jungle. - Come on. It's not that bad. - [Commentator] Three and one to Moss. Timlin is shut down tonight. Buddy Williams just called up from Syracuse ready to go tonight. Three one to Moss and he's aboard. A base on ball. The first issued by Juan Guzman with two out here in the second inning. - Boring fucking game. - [Commentator] That's John Sullivan scouted report. Williams is going over. - I'm gonna take a leak. - [Commentator] The Yankees make their way to the plate. [upbeat music] - You people have been chosen to decide the fate of a fellow human being and you must bare in mind that he comes into this courtroom an innocent man. As innocent as any of you. The government will offer you audiotapes that you cannot understand. Videotapes of old friends shaking hands on the street. Since when is that a federal offense? If you let Mr. Graham convince you. If you let Mr. Graham convince you life long friendship is a crime, you will be abetting him in a grave miscarriage of justice. Your honor I protest this obvious and deliberate distraction that has been engineered by the government. - Mr. Graham, do you have an explanation for this sudden intrusion? - Bad timing, your honor. I apologize to the jury and to Mr. Greco. - [Leo] Ladies and gentlemen, a man's life is at stake and the government indulges in cheap theatrics. - Thanks. - I don't see how they expect us not to talk about the case. - It'll be easy for me. The man is obviously guilty as sin and that's that. - There's no doubt he's guilty of a lot of things. We just have to decide if he's done what the government says he's done. - It comes to 750 including a 15% tip. If one of us pays with a credit card and collects cash from the others, then we'll have a nice deduction. - Sounds good. I'll start it. - Check out Mr. Duffy. - Our steadfast foreman. - [Man] Here you go, pal. Valerie Alston. - [Tommy] Thanks. - Murder drives a small, sharp instrument, usually an ice pick into the base of the victim's neck. - [Daniel] It's an odd method of execution, yet it seems that it would require more skill than just blowing the victim's brains out. - [Detective Gray] It's very efficient. Severs the spinal cord. It's quiet and there's very little blood. - It leaves a signature, Detective Gray? - Yeah, it's unique. Murder incorporated used it in the 30s. - It also sends a message, does it not? - [Detective Gray] Yes. - So it could be used by an organized crime hit squad to let its enemies know that they were responsible-- - Objection. Calls for a conclusion. - Sustained. You know better than that, Mr. Graham. - I apologize, your honor. I'll rephrase the question. - Oh here's a beauty. Take a look at this one, John. Oh wow. This is the headline in the post. I can see it now. The gay godfather. - You deliberately intruded on Mr. Verona's privacy. - Those cameras were placed in the bathroom to identify drug traffickers in the prison. We did not target or abuse Mr. Verona in any way. - You release those photos, you'll be ruined professionally. - Probably. But if I don't put Rusty in jail, I'm gonna be laughed out of this town, which is worse for a proud guy like me. You can understand that, can't you John? - Yeah, I can. - Sure you can 'cause you got a lot pride, too. You're a man of honor. A moral man. - I got five kids. Three grandchildren. The youngest one study for the priesthood. This will kill them. - I know, John. I hate to put you between a rock and a hard place, but you gotta decide do you testify or don't you? - Either way I'm a loser. - Let me put a different spin on it for you, John. You gotta choose to repent. You gotta seek redemption through confession. You and Rusty killed a lot of guys together. You got a lot of blood on your hands. This is a way of wiping it clean. - And if I don't? - Then every paper. Every TV station in the county gets a copy of these photos. It's a funny world we live in, John. They'll forgive you for being a murderer, but once they find out that you're a sissy, they will never ever let you live it down. - So try to be here about 15 minutes early, all right folks? Folks. Folks, remember. We mustn't discuss the case at home. We have to forget everything we've heard. All right? - Yes, Mr. Duffy, yes. - All right? - That shouldn't be hard for Duffy. Did you see him at lunch today? - Maybe he uses martinis as a memory aid. - Share a cab? I'm in Brooklyn Heights. - I'm on the west side. - I'm crushed. - I'm Valerie. Night, Paul. See you tomorrow. - You know my name. I'm miraculously restored. Well I'm off for another adventure on the subway. - Good luck. - [Paul] See you tomorrow. [gentle music] - Taxi. [gentle music] Thanks. - My pleasure. Have a nice trip. [gentle music] - Hey Tommy. Tommy. Look at him. Living in a dream world. Will you wake up you fucking lush? - Phillie. You know you can't muscle Tommy Vesey, Phillie. He just ain't scared of us. - What's to be scared? All you can do is kill me. Anyway, you need me around, Rusty. All this tore up's good for is tasting your coffee. - Piece of shit. - Phillie. Phillie, please. You know you're a big time cop, Tommy. How do you think they turned my uncle John? - Well there's no mystery. Either they got something on him or they made a deal. - There is no deal. They'd have to tell us. - Well then they got something on him. - I know this man all my life though. There's nothing. - Then they made a deal. - But he's family, Tommy. Why? Why would he betray me? - Everybody knows that the wiseguys always make the biggest rats. - Do they? Well this wiseguy owns you and I bought you cheap along time ago remember? Yeah I lifted up your badge, Tommy. You know what I found? A found a bum for hire. - I checked out your jurors. - Yeah? We're all ears. - In my humble opinion, they can't be fixed. Nobody's got any guilty secrets. - Yeah, no blackmail, huh? Any of them need money? - Everybody needs money, but you know what? Some retired mailman buying a Ferrari all of a sudden. - We can't bribe 'em, we gotta go to a plan B, huh. - This is where I came in. - You sit down. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking the money I pay you, you could afford to be a co-conspirator. And you go to plan B. Wiseguy. - Mr. Bonner, you say that you were in Limpy DeMarco's crew. That means he was your boss. - The crew boss, not the big boss. - Did he ever tell you who the big boss was? - He didn't have to. We knew. - And the big boss was? - Rusty Pirone. - Objection. Witness had no personal knowledge. - Mr. Bonner, did Limpy DeMarco ever say who the big boss was? - Rusty Pirone. - You folks got one hour for lunch. - Oh, there's a great Dim sum place-- - No thanks. I'm gonna grab a sandwich across the street. - The guy in the third row is his bodyguard. - Robbie's gotta be at soccer practice at 2:15, Lila. Fridays we get out at three so-- - You got an hour for lunch. - [Valerie] Okay. Gotta go, bye. - [Man] Spread it out, fellas. Spread it out. Split up the sides, come on. Bobby, kick it. [gentle music] - You looking for a little dark haired kid in yellow shorts? [gentle music] Take a little ride with me, okay? I wanna talk to you about Robbie. - Who are you? - Get in the car. - [Tommy] No, that's not the way. - On the floor. - [Tommy] Come on. - [Valerie] Where's my son? - [Tommy] Robbie is fine. - Where's my son? - [Man] Where's my son? Where's my son? - Shut up. I told you Robbie is fine. Nothing's gonna happen to him as long as you trust me. - What do you want? - I gotta message for you from Rusty Pirone. He wants you to know he's innocent. The government is involved in a multi million dollar conspiracy to set him up. He wants you to help him vindicate himself. - How can I do that? - All you have to do is vote to acquit him. That is all he asks. Don't listen to that phony evidence Graham throws at you. - My one vote can't get him off. - It can hang the jury. It can help us win one battle in a very long war against Graham and his lies. - This is crazy. I can't do this. - You got no choice. You gotta vote to acquit him and you gotta keep your mouth shut. You can't go to the cops. Ask me why, Valerie. - Why? - Because they can't help you. So they throw another charge on Pirone's list, what's it gonna mean? He's up for murder, so the cops protect you. With these mutts on your case, it won't matter. They will wait until the cops go away. Four, five, 10 years. And then. - They'll kill me. - Not right away. We'll let you live long enough to watch your son die. Then we'll kill you. - Yeah, you can't hide, baby. Look at JFK. [dramatic music] - There is only one person who can guarantee your life and that is me. If you vote to acquit, I'll keep you both alive. My word of honor. Do it the easy way. - Yeah. The Vesey way. - [Boy] Danny, kick it over here. Yeah, come on. - Valerie look, look. You see? He's just fine, Valerie. - Let me go to my son. Please. Please. - No, no. [dramatic music] Not like that. Not crying. You gotta be mom as usual. Juror as usual. Everything just the way it was before I came into your life. [dramatic music] You think you can do that? - Yes. - Show me, Valerie. [dramatic music] - [Boy] My turn. Give me the ball. - [Man] Here's your mom. - Robbie. - Mom. Hey mom, you gotta see these good tricks Teddy can do. - It's no big deal, you know? - Wow, you're really good, Teddy. - Yeah, I gotta go. Maybe I'll come help you practice again, all right. - Yeah. See you, Teddy. - Yeah. - Anytime you need a lift, Valerie, just call. - Yeah. Thanks, bye. - Bye. [dramatic music] [phone ringing] - [Tommy] Guess who? - What do you want from me? - I want you to relax. - After what you put me through? - You're no good to yourself or me if you freak out. Look, I can fix this for you, but you're gonna have to do everything I say. You're gonna have to trust me. You think you can do that? - I have no choice. - That's an honest answer. Force yourself to eat. Take a couple of aspirin and get some sleep. Stay calm. Stay focused. I'll get you through this I promise. [gentle music] - So, that chick turns you on. - That lady is in a jackpot. I'm just looking to give her a boost. - How 'bout me? I don't see you giving me no midnight pep talks. - You're a mutt, Wanda. You don't need me. You just need another drink. Richie. - Admit it, Vesey. That chick turns you on. [gentle music] - Stay calm. Stay focused. - [Radio Commentator] As the government star witness, Limpy DeMarco was kept under tight security, but a hit team working with military precision was able to murder him and his heavily armed bodyguards and then disappeared without a trace. [soft music] - [Dad] [laughs] Look who's here. Look who's here. All right, all right. - [Robbie] Grandpa. - [Dad] Hey now, what do we got here? Look at the big guy. - [Valerie] You sure this won't be an inconvenience? - Are you kidding? Look at the boy, honey. Look how much fun he's having out there. He and I are gonna have us a grand time the next couple of weeks. Oh by the way, I talked to Dorothy Pierce over at the school. There's no problem. - Shame he'll have to miss Cub Scouts. - No he won't either. We got a den up here. You know those kids he made friends with last summer. Hey, in a couple weeks he won't wanna come home. Now come on, sit down. Have something to eat. - [Robbie] Bring it back to me, Amber. - [Dad] Come on, Valerie, eat your breakfast before it gets cold. - Dad. - 72. 73. I do 100 of these everyday. - Oh yeah, my boyfriend does 'em like power trooper style. One hand behind his back. - What is he on steroids or something? - It's been statically proven that more people have heart attacks on Monday than any other day of the week. - Let's all go to work on Tuesday. [soft music] - [Woman] How ethnologically correct are you. - [Man] Did you know how many filthy fingers have touched those? - Coffee, milk, no sugar. I notice these things. - Thanks. - You look like you had a relaxing weekend. - Quiet. - You're currently serving a life sentence at Attica prison, are you not, Mr. Bonner? - [Bonner] Yeah. - What for? - Parking in front of a fire pump. - Answer the question, Mr. Bonner. - Why else would I be doing life? Murder. - Murder. Isn't it true that the justice department has offered you a deal in exchange for your testimony? - They said they would recommend favorable consideration. - Favorable consideration to a man convicted of murdering four people. They gonna give you a pardon, Mr. Bonner? - They didn't say. - Money. A new identity. A job. A chance to murder a few more people under government auspices. - Objection, your honor. That's a cheap shot even for Mr. Greco. - The jury will disregard the question. Proceed Mr. Greco. - Did Rusty Pirone ever pay you to kill anybody? - Not in person. - Isn't it true that you never even laid eyes on Rusty Pirone before today? That you're just trying to wangle a deal with the justice department to save your skin. Isn't it true that you're just a wannabe wiseguy? - Objection, your honor. Counsel is badgering the witness. - I'm just trying to get to the truth, your honor. - Answer the question, Mr. Bonner. - What question? I don't remember what the question was. - Did Rusty Pirone pay you after you murdered these men? - No. - [Leo] Who did? - You're gonna hang this on Limpy, Rusty? - [Leo] Who paid you, Bonner? - Limpy loved you, Rusty. In Limpy's eyes, Jesus Christ was an empty suit next to you. - Answer the question. - So what do you give him for standing up? An icepick in the neck. - Sit down, Bonner. - I'm glad I'm doing this, Rusty. - [Judge] Order in the court. Order. - I don't give a fuck what happens to me. I just wanna show the world what a dick bag you are. Yeah you. You. - Order. Order. Get this man out of here. - Christ be on you. - Get him out of here. He's dismissed. - Did you see the look on Pirone's face? - Not a blink of his eye. He could care less. - [Juror] He cares. Mr. Bonner better get himself a facelift and a ticket to the moon. - I love the way Graham turns and looks at us like we're sharing this major secret. - He makes a crushing point as far as I'm concerned. Who else would've wanted these people killed? - He's a total hunk. I bet you he runs for governor or something. - This case'll give him a big boost. - Didn't they tell us not to discuss the case? Wasn't that the very first thing they said? - Come on, Valerie. It's patently obvious that-- - The man is innocent until proven guilty. It's patently obvious we are disregarding that fact. - You're right, Mrs. Alston. We shouldn't be discussing the case until all the facts are heard. - We're back, folks. - Jane. - A leader is born. - No thanks. Jane. Jane. Listen. I can be a smug, self righteous, little bitch sometimes. - Sounds like something your ex husband told you. Besides, you're right. Everybody knows my tongue outruns my brain. - That sounds like something your ex told you. - It was my mother actually. - Hey, Mr. Graham. So. How did I do, Mr. Graham? - You did. You did great, Hughie. - Maybe we'll get him a new identity in Hollywood. - Think so? [siren blaring] - Valerie. This came for you. - Thanks, Jimmy. [gentle music] Robbie. Robbie. [phone ringing] [gentle music] - [Tommy] You're giving me a lot of heartache, Valerie. - I just wanted to make sure my son was safe. - There's such a thing as being too safe. - I don't understand that. I don't understand anything you say. - Listen to the teacher. The boy's our red seat. If we know where he is, we know where you are. If gets out from under our thumb, we got no gun to your head, which means everybody gets killed. You, your son, your old man. Work with us, Valerie. You can't get away. Stop trying. [dial tone humming] - Mr. Verona, can you tell us how you dealt with Maxy Henning? - He was shy locking. Skimming off the vague. Rusty and I got him in the van. Put him in the backseat between us. - What's the matter with that broad now? She looks like she's on Mars. - Poor bastard was shaking like a leaf. Once we got on the Belt Parkway, we pounded him a couple times remember. Slipped the plastic bag over his head. Held him down. He fought for awhile and then he stopped. And then he begged. Then his face turned purple. - That's a brutal way to kill somebody, Mr. Verona. - Rusty likes to watch people die. - God. - Likes to watch people die. - The man's an animal. - Excuse me. [soft music] - [Valerie] Hi. - Hi. - Pretty graphic testimony. - I've heard worse. - These witnesses are really brave to come forward like that. - What those mutts? Are you kidding? They get a great deal. New name, new city, new house. All paid for by Uncle Sam. Shit happened to me. - So anybody who gave evidence would have that kind of protection? - Anybody who turns in Rusty. - Hey, Delhante. Don't be telling tales out of school. - Hey Vesey, can't I talk to a pretty lady without your butting in? - Fraternizing with the jury is against the constitution. Keep an open mind. That's the American way. - Who's he? - Tommy Vesey, ex cop. Big hero on the homicide squad. You better get your coffee, doll. We're back in five minutes. - Hi. [dramatic music] Why are you going around behind my back? I'm trying to save your life. - Like you saved those four cops in the hotel? Like you saved Limpy DeMarco? - I had nothing to do with that. - Why should I believe you? You'd do anything for Pirone. - I could care less about Pirone. He buys it. I find some other geek to do errands for. That has nothing to do with this. - Oh yeah. I forgot. This is all for me. [dramatic music] - You don't buy me, fine. You can't believe this. That man is nervous enough about you as it is. He finds out you been making moves, he'll freak. He'll start killing us the way he solves his problems. - They'll catch him. He won't get away with it. - The name of the game, Valerie, is not who dies, but who dies first. That'll be your boy. You're boxed. You got nowhere to go. You gotta stay with the program. You cannot jump off now. - Rusty hated Matty Russell because he wouldn't get back on the union contracts. So we took him up to Rusty's place up into the woods. We stick him to a tree and then shot him in the knees. Rusty began shooting him in the groin and in the testicles. I said for Christ sake, Rusty, finish him off. He says nah. I want him to beg. I want him to beg for me to kill him. So I could shoot him in the balls again. - You're a liar right, Mr. Verona? - I tell lies. - You're a murderer, too. Isn't that right? - I kill guys who would've killed me if the shoe was on the other foot. - You're a lying, thieving, murderer by your own admission. Do you really expect this jury to believe anything you have to say? - I'm not asking them to believe nothing's the truth. - The truth. And just what are you getting for this sudden attack of truthfulness? What kind of a deal have you made with Mr. Graham? - No deal. - No deal. You mean Mr. Graham is not going to reward you for sending this innocent man to jail? - He's not gonna give me nothing. - How could he do that? - I don't know. I don't know. Rusty, that wasn't my fault. - Hey grab the car. - [Journalist] Sir, just one statement. Mr. Greco. - [Reporter] Were you surprised to see your uncle on the stand? - [Journalist] Is Uncle Johnny coming off the stand? - [Reporter] Just a second. Rusty. - [Journalist] Greco. - Johnny Red sure put on a show in there today, huh? I love that part about shooting the guy in the nuts. - My girlfriend isn't paying a lot attention to that is she? - She's all right. I had a little talk with her just now. - Did anybody see you? - No. Nobody saw nothing. Nobody knows nothing. Don't worry. - I'm looking to spend the next 50 years of my life in a sardine can. Did he just tell me not to worry about it? - Hey you know, it is me and Valerie right. We're gonna save your ass. Just hope you appreciate it. - Dan. We are losing one of our ladies. - What happened? - She got hysterical at the break. Said she was having nightmares about Pirone. Said she wanted off the jury. - Shit. Where is she? - She's passed out in the bathroom on the third floor. - Sh. - There's a room with a big couch in it. You can lay down and put your feet up. - No, I don't wanna lay down, okay. I am okay. - Camille. We cannot afford to lose you, babe. - I got the background on the two alternate jurors. - Forget it. Let's ask the judge if he'll offer the jurors 24 hour protection. Let's see if Camille will go for that. - You wanna play it big in the media? - Yeah. Leak it. Hint about threat to unnamed jurists, et cetera, et cetera. - Okay. I'm okay. - All right. - That'll lead the seven o'clock news. - [Woman] You can go down the stairs. Come on. - [Cop] Hey Jimmy, you want a slice? - Thanks. - Hey, that's mine. - Hey, come on. - Two cops outside my door. What a luxury. - It's the minimum requirement for life in a big city. I did get a little nervous when they said we should report anything suspicious. Have you noticed anything? - Not a thing. [gentle music] - He's right over there. I'll tell him. [dramatic music] - Uh uh uh. Are you gonna scream? No? - How'd you get in here? - I go where I want. - But the police are out front. - Honey, these police are nothing but the undertakers. They show up to move your body. Didn't I walk right by them? I could kill you right now and I'll walk out of here like nothing happened. - I guess you could. - That is the last thing that I wanna do. [soft music] Are we partners? - I guess we are. - Good. Let's get off this gruesome subject. I looked around your place. You have a lot of nice, old stuff here. - I collect things from the 40s and 50s. - You're an old fashioned person. I see that. That's nice. Just like me. Life made sense in the old days. Take a man in my position. He'd never go to trial. Men like me we paid for our respect, right? And we got it. - The good old days. - You think what you want but there was peace. There was quiet when people like me ran things. Women and children like you, you were safe on the streets. Do you know why? We did business. You could lower your prices and drive out your competition here. I'd kill the guys who got in my way. - You admit it? - In your world people go bankrupt. In mine they go to sleep. - Okay, so that's your world. Why did I have to get mixed up in it? - That's what I'm trying to put across to you. Do you think I like this? Do you honestly believe that I like putting the arm on a nice lady with a little boy? - So why are you doing it then? - I don't got a choice. I got a government here, they persecute me. You know you got Colombians and Jamaicans and there are more innocent people down there on the street right now. Do you think anybody gives a shit about this? Excuse my language, okay. They spend millions. Millions of taxpayer dollars trying to crucify here. Rusty Pirone. And they write me up on top of that like I'm some kind of a wheel. I'm a nothing. Do you understand? I'm a nothing. I'm the boss of no bosses. You know I'm not saying I'm an angel, but I never hurt nobody didn't come hurt me first. - You'll kill me. - Right 'cause you could hurt me tomorrow, honey, but you're with me now. And we're gonna do right by each other. Now what is it? You don't think I see you're a lovely woman? I feel for you. I know you're going along great and all of a sudden you're in business with me, right. You need Rusty Pirone in your life. - And he needs me. - Right but you don't got the leverage 'cause they could put me under 10 tons of concrete and I'll reach out. I kill you, your boy, or your father, what do you do to me? Nothing. I have the power here. Do you understand this? - I do. - You're a desperado just like me. So forget these mama looks out here. They're not gonna help. You know whatever your father told you, your mother told you, the priests, the teachers forget 'cause the only guy you really gotta worry about now Valerie is me. - I'll do what you want. - Good. You're a smart girl. [soft music] Oh you like old fashioned clothes, too. - I sell antique clothing. - Well this stuff is great. This reminds me of the movie stars, right. 1940s. Yeah, some classy women in those days. Not like the sluts we got running around today. Come here. Put this on for me. [soft music] Please. [soft music] Should think of me as family. [soft music] It's funny, I love old movies. You know sometimes I wish I'd go back to the 40s just to meet somebody like her. Hey. These are nice. They go with that. [gentle music] You look just like one of those movie stars. - You're in control. You don't have to prove it. [gentle music] - This will make it official. [dramatic music] - Right. - What do we own a piece of this? - No, we own the whole thing. - You okay? - Are you kidding? I'm the guy who falls into a sewer comes out with his pants pressed. Hey, give me that. Yup. There is nothing in the world like a classy piece of ass. [gentle music] - Sometimes we must use extraordinary means to apprehend and convict a dangerous criminal. Sometimes we must use the evil elements of our society in our battle against the evil which threatens to overpower us. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we've used crooks to catch a crook, but only because law abiding citizens do not associate with criminals like Rusty Pirone. Yes we offered certain inducements to Hughie Bonner, but ladies and gentlemen, you saw the depth of his hatred for Rusty Pirone. You heard John Verona, Mr. Pirone's uncle and closet associate. You heard him testify to the bestial crimes they planned and committed together. John Verona asked for and received nothing from us. He's a man who simply wishes to purge his soul. To restore his honor and the honor of his family. - I think we should begin with a quick vote. - I love it. He had him right here. - I was waiting for that old broad to stand up and salute. - Was that a smattering of applause I heard at the end of your summation? - Must've been my mother. - I couldn't believe Greco's persecution line. Nobody's gonna buy that crap. - Looks like we're gonna make it home tonight, bro. - We could've gone across the street. - We could've gone to the moon. - Look Mrs. Alston, it's 11 for and one against. Don't you have any respect for our opinions? - It's not a matter of respect. I just don't think they proved their case. - What? - You keep saying that over and over again. What do you want? God to come down and tell you he's guilty. - Don't browbeat her, Raphael. - Well for Christ sake after all the testimony we've heard. - Even his uncle thinks he's a murderer. - You said you have a real problem with the evidence, but this is what you get in every trial of this nature. - What is it? Photographs of Pirone with some men. - Each of whom ended up dead. - Doesn't mean he killed them. Neither do videotapes of Pirone talking to these so called assassins. - There's nothing so called about them. They're all convicted murderers, Mrs. Alston. - How many times do I have to tell you? My name is not Mrs. Alston. - Hey, you want a drink, Tommy? Go with Benny in the back. - No. I like a little piano music when I drink. Not a bunch of old men clicking bocce balls. [phone ringing] Aha. [phone ringing] Hello. Where? Okay. Your jury has checked into a hotel for the night. - Why can't they make up their fucking mind? - The more time they spend, the better off you are. They'll probably trying to wear down your girlfriend, Rusty. - I guess they could forget that 'cause my lady's gonna stand up for me all the way. - You don't understand, Paul. - Look, I've marched for a million different causes and I believe in a defendant's constitutional rights, but in this case I really feel that Pirone's gotten a fair trial. - Paul. I cannot vote to convict this man. - Okay Valerie, I respect your position. Actually. You're beginning to make me feel like I'm compromising my principles. - [Juror] This is not a constitutional issue. - Yes, it is. The man is being tried on the basis of his reputation, his notoriety, his prior convictions. Everything but the evidence. - Simply not true. There's tons of evidence. - All of it tainted. - How can you say that? - Because if they had any one of us on trial, they wouldn't be able to use the hearsay. They wouldn't be able to use the constitutional obtained surveillance. - It was not unconstitutionally obtained. - Can I say something? People like Rusty Pirone were not around when the constitution was written. - That's irrelevant. - Would you let him speak? - Let me finish. This is a man who has as much power as the government in some ways. He has millions of dollars. He has sources of information. - That does not mean we should deny him his constitutional rights. - I have to agree with that. - Oh great. So now you're on her side? - I just happen to like that part of her agreement. - Yeah, I know what part of her you like. - You know, that's completely out of line. - Hey, you guys. You wanna get into a pissing contest or you wanna resolve this? - [Jane] Paul. - You know that guy has been on my case from the day we started. - [Albert] Let me get this straight, Valerie. You are convinced that Pirone is guilty, right? - No, I'm not actually. - You're not? - He could've been setup. People in this country have been wrongfully accused before. Haven't they, Albert? - That's true. - Listen, I don't care about Rusty Pirone. I care about myself. What if the government gets a vendetta against me or any one of us? Will some other jury allow their use of trumped up evidence? Will they allow Graham to crucify us? - That's the most blatant piece of sophistry I've ever heard. - There's no need to get personal. - [Man] This constitutional thing is a red herring. - [Juror] Rusty Pirone is a mad dog. He has no rights. - We can't let ourselves get into that kind of thinking. - Come on, people. This has nothing to do with the constitution, which none of us knows anything about anyway. - Speak for yourself, Elliot. - Please, Paul, I think this is more basic. You find Pirone attractive, don't you? - [Woman] Oh no, not that. - That's great. Just great. - No, no, no, no, no. All that crude, evil power. I bet you like that. I bet it really turns you on. - You're a sick bastard. You know that? That's disgusting and I'm not gonna tolerate it. - Why do you think they allowed so many women on this jury? 'Cause they know Pirone's got this cheap, vulgar sex appeal that women go for. - Seems more likely you would go for that. - Wrong, dear. I have better taste. - Man, now you're all going off on tangents here. - And you're not? You started this whole thing with your stupid accusations against me. - Don't call me stupid, pal. - [Paul] Get your finger out of my face. - [Duffy] Let's get back to basics. Mrs. Alston refuses to deal with the facts. - [Paul] Excuse me, but her point is that they're not facts at all. - [Jane] And for the 99th time, her name is not Mrs. Alston. - But we're hardly into the second day, your honor. Pulling the plug would be premature. Couldn't you at least give him a Murphy charge? Send him back. - In most cases I would but this is different. I've spoken to the four jurors myself. - There are four for acquittal? - The deliberation seem to have gone down a side road of governmental misconduct. - Misconduct? - I wanna congratulate you, your honor, for your fair and impartial handling of this trial. - All rise. Be seated. - I understand you have worked hard and long and were not able to reach a verdict. I thank you for your efforts, but I am sorry they did not bear fruit. Jury is excused. - We had a strong case. A strong presentation. The jury got sidetracked. It happens. - We'll get another shot. - Only this time the spin is the jury let themselves get hoaxed by this constitutional thing and shouldn't happen again. - Good evening, folks. Excuse me. - What's this? - Champagne. Compliments of Mr. Pirone. He's in the back. - Prick. He's not gonna drink champagne in my face. - Dan. Dan. Dan, what are you doing? Dan, please. - Not so low, asshole. - You know this is the kind of class move I should have expected from you. - This is my joint, Pirone. You wanna celebrate, you go to one of your fucking rat holes. - Yeah, you gonna throw me out? - I'm not scared of you, Pirone. I grew up with scum like you. - No, no, you grew up with me, you wouldn't have grown up. - Rusty, back off. Who cares? He means nothing. - I'm not finished with you, Pirone. I'm gonna put you away. Even when you're dead I'm gonna come and spit on your grave. - Spit on me now. - Hey boss. - Relax. Get him out of here. - Come on, spit. - Get him out of here. - Spit. - I'm gonna put you away. - Thank God for the constitution, huh. Protect me from opportunists like you. Protect all of us from opportunists like you. - [Woman] Tell him, Rusty. [gentle music] [phone ringing] - [Tommy] I'm proud of you, Valerie. - Thanks for nothing. I'm free now, right? - [Tommy] Free as a bird. - And I never have to see any of you again? - We're out of your life forever. - Aha. Watch out, mom. Yes. Yeah, see. I play everyday so my game's gotten better. - That's why I want you to stay. - [Robbie] Aw, nice shot. - You'll be slamming dunking by spring break. - We moving here for good, mom? - [Valerie] Would you like to? - I miss my friends. - You'll make new ones. You already have. - Mom, are you okay? - I'm fine. I couldn't be better. Everything is just fine. [gentle music] - Don't say I never gave you nothing. - I thought I was through with you people. - Consider this as a house call. I know you got that. That empty, hopeless, sick feeling and nobody in the world you can talk to about it. Except me. [gentle music] - What? - Have you been thinking about going to Graham? - You expect me to tell you? - Don't do it. Confession will not be good for your soul. Anyway, you got nothing to be ashamed of. - You don't think so? I let a murderer go. - You saved your kid's life. Nobody could blame you for that. - When he kills again? - It won't be nobody you'd have for dinner. Look. Rusty Pirone is racing to the cemetery. All you did was give him some time to catch his breath. You did your thing. Now you walk away. - It's not that easy. Something happened to me in that jury room. I lied to people. I used them. Played on their weakness. Flirted when I had to. Played the martyr. The weak little woman. - It's over. Everything's back to normal. - No, it's not. You showed me a part of myself I never knew existed. I'll never be the same. You changed me, Vesey. - It was a question of due process and constitutional rights. Valerie Alston really put it into perspective for me. - You should've seen the way they jumped on Valerie Alston. They simply would not allow a woman to express a dissenting opinion. - That woman is to blame 100%. She's typical of what's going on in this country today. - Valerie Alston. Valerie Alston. Space cadet. But she took over in the jury room. - In the early going, she was the only holdout. - Yeah, which means she came on the floor with her mind made up. We thought we had her in the pocket. - You think she had a hidden agenda? - You checked her background. Any criminal history, mob connections, radical politics? - [Man] She's a sweetheart as sigma chi. - Did she exhibit any odd or unusual behavior during the trial? - Not really. She moved her kid up to her father's place up in the country. Took him out of school. - Like she was scared of something. Can you get in the house? - Aye boss, I can't-- - You can't get a search warrant because a lady voted against you. - Yes I can if I suspect jury tampering. [bright music] Juror number four as I live and breathe. - Hello. - Won't you join me, Miss Alston? I come from a large family. I hate to eat alone. - I'm in kind of a hurry. - Hey. You ruined my career. Least you could do is break bread with me. - [Valerie] I expect to find you in more elegant surroundings. - This is the new thing according to New York Magazine. Yeah. Americans are returning to more traditional values. They're getting married younger. They prefer simple food. - Is your career really over? - You really sound as if you care. Truth is I got a personal interest in nailing guys like Rusty Pirone. - What'd he do to you? - It's not what he did. It's how he represents. I grew up with these guys. Have a friend. His father worked in the docks. They beat him to death because he ran for union office and when my friend tried to get even, his own family. His own family told him let it go. Just let it go. It's better for everybody. Let your father's death go unpunished. - That was in the old days. They don't have that kind of power anymore. - It's true. We got Rusty Pirone on the run. He's not the man he used to be. - He's the boss of no bosses. - Yeah and that makes him even more dangerous. He's a cornered rat. He's got nothing to lose. Listen to me, Valerie. I know these guys like to portray themselves as romantic desperadoes who kill only their own, but they prey on innocent people. - I don't have any illusions about Rusty Pirone believe me. - Then why did? Nevermind. You know I'm sick of talking about this trial. You want a coffee? - Sure. [gentle music] - [Man] Found these in her bedroom trash can. - Not like the lady to rip photos of her son. - Nah, she wasn't ripping her son. Say hello to Teddy Parnell. He's got three priors for attempted murder. Assault with a deadly weapon. Does freelance work for Pirone. [doorbell buzzing] - I know it's late but I gotta talk to you. - Don't tell me. You come from a big family and you hate to sleep alone. - This isn't a come on and you know it. Could we shed some light on the subject? - Don't you remember where the light is? Oh I forgot. You were experiencing America's return to traditional values while they searched my house. - You know this guy? - Only too well. I've gotten him out of my life I hope. - But this guy's a low life. He's done time for assault for attempted murder. - That's nothing. You know what his greatest crime is? He's a lousy lay and then he expects you to wait on him hand and foot. - Where'd you meet him? - In a bar on the west side. Do you want me to put this on tape so you can play it back in the privacy of your boudoir? - You're overselling. It never happened. - You want a drink, Mr. Graham? - I'll tell you what happened. This guy Parnell. He got to you. He threatened to kill you and your son if you didn't vote to acquit Rusty Pirone. - Are you one of these men who blames everybody else for his failures? - You should've called me immediately. I could've protected you. None of this nightmare would ever have happened. - Mr. Graham, I think you've been working too hard. - [Daniel] I'm trying to help you. - Get your hands off me. You're a hypocrite. - You have no right to say that. You never gave me a chance. - I can't believe I fell for that they killed my best friend's father lie. - That was the truth. - Truth? Tell me you wouldn't lie. You wouldn't withhold evidence. You wouldn't sacrifice anybody to get what you want. - All the saints are in heaven, Valerie. I'm just trying to put a very bad man in jail. - And you don't care how you do it. There's no right or wrong here. This is a private war between you and Pirone. - Okay, it is a vendetta. But as long as people like Rusty Pirone can make millions off other people's misery. As long as he can kill at will. As long as he's free to do whatever he feels like doing anytime, then nobody's safe. Yeah, they pay me. Careerist prick that I am to stop him. And I can't do it. I can't do it without you. - There's nothing I can do. - And it don't stop there, Valerie. The only way I can get Pirone is to get you first and I will. I got strong evidence that I can easily turn into proof. - [Valerie] Goodnight, Mr. Graham. - You better start thinking about who's gonna look after your kid when you're in jail. - Hi boss. - So I put a guy outside her house and guess who comes waltzing out at one in the morning? Our friend Mr. Graham. He was in and out of there in less than an hour. - An hour, huh? What is he a fireman? You gotta have a whole night to do justice to a woman like that my friend. - [Man] Hey, Rusty. - Hey, how are you? - [Man] Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. - We were rooting for you. - We were. - Well the jury must have got vibes, honey, 'cause I am free out on the street. I look great, too. You gonna put me in a movie now? - Think we can do better than that. I wanna make a movie about your life. - About my life? Get out of here. My life is boring. Thank you, hon. Boring. Listen, you put me in a movie. You let me wear my own clothes. I'll make you look good. [soft music] You know if she was sitting there right now, she'd put every one of these whores to shame. You're still here? - [Phillie] All right. No knives, no guns. This can't look like a hit. - [Man] Chill, Phil. We know what you're talking about. - [Phillie] We don't want any fingers pointing our way. - So you want us to make it look like a sex crime, Phillie. - You can make it look like mono fucking nucleosis for all I care. Will you get your nose out of that shit and listen to me? - Keep it down in the peanut gallery, will ya. [soft music] - [Wanda] Vesey. [soft music] - Valerie? - Shut up. - Get away from me. - Come on. I'll put on a little white see through. Talk that little girl talk. You'll never know the difference. - You could never be her. You wouldn't know how. Get away from me. Keep away from me. - Check it out, Vesey, 'cause this is the closet you'll ever gonna get to your beloved Valerie. - Come on, baby. Hang with your friends. We want you. - [Woman] Yeah we can go over there when we finish. - Oh excuse me, miss. Yeah I'm looking for this vintage clothing store. - Hi. [dramatic music] - [Valerie] Help me. Help. [dramatic music] - Phillie says take her to The Ramble. Like somebody grabbed her by her house and dragged her into the park. [dramatic music] [horn blaring] - Help me. Help me. [horn blaring] Help me. Help me. - Let's go. [dramatic music] - Peekaboo. [dramatic music] - No. No. Don't kill me. Let me go. - Put her down. - [Valerie] Don't kill me. - Let her beg. Oh shit. [dramatic music] [gun firing] - Back off, Edmund. - Vesey. [gun firing] Hold it, hold it. [gun firing] - Okay. Okay, Valerie, let's go. [gun firing] [dramatic music] Run. Run. [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] Are you hit? - [Valerie] No. - That's good. Let's go. [soft music] You go ahead. I'll follow you. [soft music] - I'll call an ambulance. - No. Later. You gotta square it with Pirone. - What do you mean? - It's gone too far for the cops. He'll send 1000 mutts after you. You gotta straighten this out yourself. - How? - You can push his buttons. You can get over on him. Just like you did on that jury. - You saved my life. - Get out of here. Go. [sirens blaring] [soft music] - Hey, how's it going? [soft music] [phone ringing] - [Valerie] Surprise. - Ooh, the lucky girl. Now where you calling from? - A booth. I didn't want this number on my record. - You're a smart girl. - [Valerie] Thanks. - Now what do I do for you? - I wanna show you that I can be trusted. I wanna know I can trust you, too. - You know what? I think I'm glad you made it. - Hey, hold on, fellas. I guess not even the bad guys are safe in Central Park. - Who's that? - Tommy Vesey. Crooked cop. Drugs, payoffs. Ended up doing odd jobs for Pirone. - Yeah, it's a Pirone party, but where's the host? - You're gonna love this. He ditched a tail on the west side highway. Guy could be anywhere. [soft music] - [Tommy] The name of the game, Valerie, is not who dies, but who dies first. That'll be your boy. - [Rusty] You know whatever your father told you, your mother told you, the priests, the teachers forget 'cause the only guy you really gotta worry about now Valerie is me. [dramatic music] - You sure you have enough privacy here? Lucky I'm a country girl and know how to drive these roads. - Very lucky. Very lucky indeed. You want a cocktail? - It's a little early. - Not for you. You've been up all night. - True. [soft music] - You ever try yellow parrot? Now here's a drink you see in all the old movies. May you live 100 years. [soft music] - Sweet. This where you killed Matty Russell? - No, no. I sold that joint a long time ago. This is my private hideaway. Nobody knows. - [Valerie] Nobody but me. - Won't you sit down? [soft music] - You tried to kill me. - Yeah. You're my first failure, too, in 20 years. - Vesey saved me. Is he okay? - He don't owe nobody money no more. [soft music] Took guts for you to come here. - It's the only thing I could do. I have to show you that I can be trusted. I'm not gonna talk. - No? Graham is on your case. Now how do I know he's not gonna break you down? - Because there's nothing in it for me. Graham can't prove anything without me and I'd be crazy to turn my life upside down to prove a case against a man who has the power of life and death over me. - I'm impressed. That's a good proposition. That's nice. Just not good enough. - What more can I give you? - Come here. [gentle music] That night. You liked it? - I liked it. [gentle music] - Yeah. You and me start going around, we'd make all the papers. - The godfather and the juror. Graham would lose his mind. - I gave you the good news. - What's the bad news, Rusty? - I don't trust anybody. I don't trust the stool pigeons in my family. And my freelancers are dead. Even Vesey. And you're the only one left here that really knows what the hell went down. Now what would you do? - You could trust me. - You know you're the first person in my life I don't wanna hurt? [gentle music] I'll be a fool to let you live, right. [gentle music] I must be a fool. [dramatic music] Yeah, you die. [dramatic music] Smart girl. - Doorman said she came home around 10 o'clock looking good. Like she stayed the night somewhere. - Any news of Pirone? - He's vanished. Nobody knows where he is. I think they clipped him. - Yeah, that's what that massacre in the park was about. - That's great for us. That's great. The spin is that the other families were so worried about our prosecution that killed Pirone to take the heat off their own scams. What do you think? - Valerie isn't a party girl. She don't stay out. - You were wrong about Valerie, Dan. Why can't you admit that? She's a ditz. She was out of her league on that jury. Look, she's got her kid and now everything's back to normal. - Normal? Hey, excuse the language, Eleanor, but you never know about these broads. Sometimes the quiet ones. You know what I mean. Maybe she's got a secret life. - Yeah well she's not gonna have any secrets from me. - Yeah. Yes, my room. All right. I feel like my room is hugging me, mom. - It missed you. - He really is happier here. - It's his home. Mine, too. - Grandpa, look at this. Come here. I wanna show you something. [gentle music] - [Valerie] Where's the team? - I can't see them. Maybe we came to the wrong field. - Maybe they called it off. - Valerie. Hi. Hey, you don't have to do that. I'm one of the good guys. - So you keep telling me. - So you like soccer, Robbie? - Spare us the courtroom charm, Mr. Graham. - I like sports. - You like games. - Come on, mom. - You're one tough customer. You know that? Okay, Rusty Pirone's missing. Disappeared. Nobody knows where he is. Not even his own guys. - You want me to find him for you? - Maybe you can tell us where to start looking. I'm sorry. That was clumsy. Listen to me. Please. It's just me here. No wires. No backup. It's not about nailing anybody anymore. I just wanna know. Did Rusty Pirone get to you? You just gotta say one word. Yes or no. I can't do anything to you. I don't want to. I just wanna know. - You live your life believing in justice and the rule of law and someone grabs you off the street in broad daylight. Walks right past the police into your bedroom. Tells you he'll reach out from the grave and kill your son if you don't do what he says. Have you ever been confronted by that kind of evil? You don't think about right or wrong. All you think about is survival. You do what you have to do. - Thanks. - [Robbie] Mom, come on. Let's go. - Valerie. You'll be okay? - I'll be fine. Now I'll be fine. [gentle music] [bright music]
