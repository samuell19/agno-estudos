- This is how my enchanted story begins. I live in my Dad's kingdom. Actually, scratch that. The shareholders' kingdom. Well, my stepmother's kingdom, but it'll soon be the stockholders' so, might as well call it their property, which my dad would be mad about if he found out, but he never did. He died three years ago. I wish I was a regular girl, but as of now, this is my life. Anyway, I should get back to my regular tasks. This is a mess. - Cinderella, my wine! I'm Cinderella, by the way. I think I forgot to mention that. - Cinderella! - These are my step-sisters. - Cinderella! - They are a charm, as you can see. What happened, Lexi? - We can't turn the channel, we just got our nails done and our manicurist doesn't want us to anything that can damage the nails. - I need water, too. - Uh, no, it bloats you, and I'm not taking you to the mall looking like a balloon. - Lexi, that's rude. You don't need to talk to her like that. - No, she is right. We're on a new diet, anyway. - It's called the no-pass. You don't let anything pass through your lips between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:30 PM, then a light snack and go to bed at 9:00 PM. - I'm down a pound and a half. - That's because you're not dedicated. Don't think I didn't see you eating that chocolate bar behind the pool house. - You know, you don't need to be so mean and neither of you need to be dieting. - We're trying to stay fierce. Oh, what happened to you? - I was scrubbing the floors. - Have you thought about scrubbing yourself instead? - How do you manage to do these things to yourself? - It's a special talent, I guess. I mean, have you ever seen someone that tries so hard and yet still manages to look so dirty? Alright. - Coming through, it's me time, alright. Here you go and move your feet. Thank you. It's me time. - As always. - Don't make me take off these cucumbers. I don't have time for you. Cinderella, my wine! - This is disgusting. - You must make this again. - But they don't hold a finger to Morgan, my stepmother. I honestly don't know what my father saw in that woman. - Girls, I have news. - Really? - No, not for you. Oh goodness dear, you are a disaster. - I've been cleaning all day. - The Windsor family will be attending this year's Perrault Shareholders' Ball. - Adam Windsor? - He is so dreamy. - The very same. - What does he look like? - How do I know. He's very rich. - He sounds-- - So he RSVPed? - Oh no, but he's going to. You know I always have an ear to the ground. Cinderella, please clean up this mess. We don't want this place looking like a pigsty. - Hey Cindy. - Hey Aunt Claudia. - What are you doing, honey? - As always. You know what it's like living here. - I don't know why you put up with those women. - What option do I have? - Well my home. My home is always open. You don't deserve that type of treatment. Why don't you let me tell the shareholders? - No, don't do that. - Why are you concerned so much about the company with everything you're going through? - Are you coming to the ball? - Ah, you know that company stuff gives me the shingles. There's a reason I left. - Please come. - Maybe. Maybe I'll surprise you. Okay, I love you. - Love you too. I miss my Aunt Claudia. She's the only family I have left. The only one that understands me. I wish you were here. It feels so lonely without you, Dad. I miss you, Dad. Dad. - Dad. Dad! - Yes, dear? - Aren't we rich? - Incredibly. - Then why don't we have a butler or a kitchen staff? - And how much of our money did you earn? - I don't have a job. - Well taking care of this place is our job. I'm not gonna raise one of those little rich kids that doesn't know how to work. - I can learn about it. I could read Oliver Twist. - Oh, that's a great idea. But in the meantime you're gonna learn to cook and you're gonna learn to clean and you're gonna have to help take care of this place. You have to value what you have and learn to take care of it, okay? All of this is the heritage of the company that our family built and we honor their very hard work by continuing to work hard. - Still sucks. Well, that it does. That it does. - So I'm thinking about putting some pink bows over there. - I think it'll be nice, honey. - So I think I'm gonna get chocolate cake. - Of course. Chocolate, your favorite. So I'm sorry but I gotta go, I gotta do the meeting, okay? I won't be a minute longer than I have to. I got you something. - You did? - Yeah, it's your birthday. - What is it? - You gotta open it. - Can I shake it? Oh, it's beautiful, Dad. Can I put it on? - Yeah. Oh, I knew you'd like it. I know my girl. - Thank you. - Oh, there she is. My pretty girl. Is she okay? - Please don't leave me with them. - Come on now. Aunt Claudia's here, your friends will be here any minute. You'll be fine. - You know what I mean. - Look, I won't stay one minute longer than I have to, okay? - Okay. - Okay. I love you. You alright? I'll be right back. - He said he was coming back. - I can tell you he wanted to, I promise you. - What do I do? What do I do? - We'll figure it out together, okay? We'll figure it out together. - Did he leave a will? - Can we talk about that later, Morgan? - I'm doing this for you, Dad. There's not that much science in keeping a house clean and organized, especially when you do it every day of your life. It's an art my stepsisters will never understand, due to their mother's enabling. Sure, it might take some time. Okay, fine, a lot of time. My father always told me that keeping busy was the best medicine. He always wanted me to face my challenges head-first. I like to think that maybe one day this will amount to something. Maybe even owning my own house. Sometimes the cleaning keeps my mind off of what's going on around me. The faster I finish, the faster I'll have time to myself. Or at least, that's what I like to think. With its own beautiful garden, tall trees, room for horses, away from my step family. Away from all things bad. A place for happiness. A place for me. - Hello. Hello. Anybody home? - Oh, hi, uh... Right, good I was just, uh... And then the thing fell one me and then I was like... - Yeah, it happens all the time. - Right, well. Anyway, I have the RSVP for Rex Windsor and family. - Ah, you know they have mail that they actually just bring letters right here to my door. - Mail, mail. I think I've heard of such a thing. - What are you doing here? - My boss insists that I get a few pictures of the place. - Oh, why? Oh, because he owns the place, doesn't he? - Yeah, kind of. It isn't official yet, right? - I mean he is buying the company, so he's going to own everything. - He has me take lots of pictures. It doesn't mean anything, he just likes getting me out of the office. - Well good. Enjoy. - Oh, hello. You're the Windsor family's emissary, are you not? - Yes. Paul, Paul messenger. - What an unexpected delight. You have to see what I've done to the place, especially the window treatments. Let me show you around. - Okay. It's quite lovely. - So is there any reason why the Windsor family will be attending this year's ball? - Ah, you've heard the rumor. - Well, a little birdie may have told me that Rex is looking for a suitable lady for his son. - Yes, Rex is always on the lookout for acceptable young ladies for Adam. - Well, let me tell you you won't find a more acceptable girl than the ones living in this house. - Yes, the girl I met at the front door, she seemed like an excellent young lady. - Cinderella? No, not her. That's not Adam's type. Now, maybe if Adam's name was Amy then maybe he'd have a shot, but no. I was talking about my two daughters. They are of the highest class and sophistication. - Didn't I teach you better than this? I told the messenger that you girls were the most acceptable girls for the young prince. - Is that supposed to be a compliment? Is she speaking? Why is she speaking? - I didn't hear anything. - I don't know, it just doesn't sound like a great compliment to me. - Rex is looking for a beautiful, charming, and elegant girl for his son, so yes, acceptable is a compliment. - I mean, if he likes smiling, waving, and taking a backseat. - And being rich and powerful. - Did you notice that the messenger was taking pictures of the house today? - Of course, dear. You didn't think he would let us live here forever, did you? - I guess not. - What is that? - Uh, it's meatloaf. - Excuse me, I told you we're on the Janoski diet, right? - Oh, that's right. You did send me a link, but I didn't read it all. - It's so simple. We don't eat anything with a chin. Chin molecules of the meat go right to your chin. We need to make sure that we're ready for selfies with the ball coming. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Who put this on my plate? - Cinderella needs to make us a new dinner. - I spent hours cooking this. - The food is all over the tray. The chin molecules will be all over the food. - Cinderella, why are you arguing with science? Take the food away! - Science. - Do you have a problem with science? - You know I don't know how to answer that. None of these fad diets are science. - Go clean the kitchen up. We're going out tonight and the kitchen needs to be shining. And please, don't let this happen again. - Yes ma'am. - Girls, where do you want to go eat? - Let's head to the steakhouse. - Mm, I could really go for a steak. - Steak it is. Let's go. - What did I ever do to you? ♪ Oh, little princess ♪ ♪ Don't lose the girl ♪ ♪ And there inside you ♪ ♪ She'll get lost in the world ♪ ♪ Don't fall like the rest ♪ ♪ This world's just a test ♪ ♪ If your drop your crown one day ♪ ♪ Pick it up and go your way ♪ - It doesn't matter how you fix it, as long as you fix it. - I need you to do this before the party. - Oh, actually I was gonna go get a new outfit. - Why? - Well I haven't bought any clothes since, well... - Aren't you high maintenance? Well, if you get the list done I guess you can get an outfit. I mean, I don't see why you would need one. - There you are, Mother. You have to see what we bought today. - We're gonna look fierce. - Of course, you're my girls. - Polish the utensils, wax the floor. I mean do you we even own an aquarium? - If we don't put it on the list. - Please stop wining, Cinderella. We have to show Mother our haul. - Shall we. - I sent you the details of our new diet, the soylent green diet. Only foods that are made with soy, lentils, or are the color green. Got it. I can do this. I'm going to that ball. - What is this? This is actually cute. - I know. It looks so good on me, too. - No way, hold on. Mine's gonna look better on me. - Cinderella's not going to that ball. - What? - Cinderella is not going to that ball. - Why not? - This is a very important moment for us. If Cinderella goes she's just gonna distract us from our moment. - Cinderella's not going to distract anyone while I'm in the room. - Cinderella is very pretty. - What? Whose side are you on? - Girls, we're all on the same side. It's not about beauty. It's known that she is the heir of her father. If Cinderella goes everyone's gonna wanna talk to her. - They can't. - But they will! - I won't stand for it. - Oh Lexi darling, I know you won't stand for it. But you know what? My darlings. We won't stand for it. It doesn't matter what Cinderella wants. She's not going to that ball. - What are you doing? That's mine. - I like this one too. - Get, get. That's my. You're gonna pay. Get, get. - Alright, then give me mine back. - I'm the oldest one. You need what? - I need water. - You need what? What do you need? What do you need? - Are you finished? - Almost. Your tea is ready. - I see. - I have dinner going, soylent green approved. - Well, I see you have everything in hand. I can't believe how fast you've gotten through that list. You see what a positive attitude can bring you? Now everything's ready for the ball. - The ball. - It can be tedious. - Yeah, I used to think that, but I feel like I owe this to my father. It makes me feel closer to him somehow, you know? - Mm-hm, it's just a party. - Not to me. - Hm. - It's the shareholders' ball. My father says it was an opportunity for everybody and to be a part of the kingdom. I feel like it's my responsibility as a Perrault to be there and to make it happen, you know? - Isn't that terrific. - It is terrific. I have a good feeling about thi-- And I'm talking to myself. Not the first time, or the last. I kinda like talking to myself. Okay, I should stop. This is getting weird. Hey, Aunt Claudia. - Hey. What are you doing? - I'm alright. Not too bad. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just spent the whole day cleaning. - Didn't Morgan help you? - She was busy buying clothes for herself. - And her daughters? - Buying even more clothes for themselves. - I understand. - Are you coming to the ball? - I still haven't finished the deal in London. I miss you. - I miss you too. But you're going to the ball. - I don't know. If I don't finish my chores I can't go. - Why not? - Morgan. She gave me a list of chores. I'm done with most of them. I still have the appetizers. She's going too far. Rest up, okay? You and I have a busy day tomorrow and I'll see you soon. - Goodnight, Aunt Claudia. - Goodnight, my love. - Tomorrow's a big day. - Father, what exactly are we doing here? - We are checking the place out. We own it now. - And you'd agree that this has nothing to do with this fascination of yours to get me to marry one of the Perrault girls, right? - It was a suggestion. I make them all the time. You don't have to do anything, just meet the girls. Marrying one of them could make the transition easier for some of the stockholders of this backwards company. - Am I not going to meet them all tonight? - This... - Pardon? - It's not just a party; it's a ball. Puffy dresses, masks, the whole nine yards. I thought it would be easier to talk to them now. - There's always a time. - Do you have anything better to do? That's what I thought. - Oh my God! I'm frickin' late! I'm late, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late. - Hello, I didn't know you were coming. - We thought we'd get a look at the place. - Well please, come in. It's yours after all, Rex. - Well I guess you're right. - Ohh. - Of course, we also wanted to meet your lovely family. - I'm late! Oh my God, I'm late. I'm frickin' late. - And that was... - Cinderella, she's having one of her better days. You know, when she's not being violent. - I was told she was sweet. - She could be, but you know the doctors say deranged. Let me show you around. - Just get half a flower bouquet and put out the decorations. I think I'll have time to get a dress. - Oh, Adam smiled at me. - He looked at me and smiled. - Are you implying that I got a residual smile? - He looked at me and smiled at me first. Your smile was just a leftover smile. - Mercedes, can you pass me the-- - The what? - We're trying to get ready for the ball. - Yeah. We have a lot to do before the ball. - Why are you wearing that? - Why? - That's the hair clip my father got me - Hm? - Lexi, maybe you should give it back. - No, I like it. - It's not yours! - Well you're gonna have to catch me. - Give it back! - I don't want to. You can't make me. - Give it back! - You have some cleaning to do, don't you? - You are a terrible human being. Just give it back. - You're such a crybaby. - You're so mean! - Get away from me. - What is going on here? - She's wearing my hair clip. - It goes with my outfit for the ball. - Girls, in this family we share. - It's from her father. - I was going to wear it to the ball. - Oh dear, you're not going to the ball. - What? - There's too much of a mess around here. - I have been cleaning all day. Everything in this house is clean. - Well then I'll just have to find something. - I have been working hard for days. You haven't asked your daughters to lift a finger. They do nothing around here. - Oh, we did 40 minutes of Pilates class. I wouldn't call that nothing. - Aha! - Why would you do that? - The guests will be here in two hours. Clean up all these lentils and then you can go to the party. - Aww, sis. - This isn't fair. I would be proud to serve this to Lexi. We're a family who shares, right? How are there no nice dresses? - Because I took them out. - I cleaned up all the lentils. - I don't care. You're not going to the ball. - I have done everything you've asked of me, Morgan. - My girls need to shine and you're just a distraction to them. - Well this party's happening in this house, isn't it? - In this house, but not in this room! - Open the door! - I'll let you out tomorrow. - Don't you think the guests are going to complain when they hear me banging on the walls? - Pound all you want. With the music loud nobody'll hear. Stop crying like a baby. You're just like your father. Why is this happening to me? Why are they treating me this way? - Welcome to the Perrault Shareholders' Ball. Oh, hm. It's you. - You're always so welcoming, Morgan. - Oh you're always welcome, Aunt Claudia. After all, we are sisters by marriage. - You disgust me. - Mhmm. Can I get your ticket? - You know I wasn't invited to the ball. - Oh, I am so shocked. We're gonna have to get that rectified. Oh wait, we already sent out the invitations, so we're gonna have to rectify that for the next year's ball. - Well sister, I cannot thank you enough for your kindness and I cannot wait for next year, but in the meantime where is my niece? - She went out to get stuff for the party! Oh gentlemen, hello. Guess who I am? - Some mysterious enchantress? - Oh you're so special. It's me, Morgan. - Oh, I never would have guessed. - Please, come join the party. - Thank you. Oh, what lovely decor. Beautiful. - Oh, let me go get my daughters. - This is very important for the future of our company. - Dad, this is your company. It's only our company when you need me to do something for you. - The company that pays for everything you've ever worn, eaten, driven, played with or slept on. I need you to-- - Alright. I got it, Dad. - I'm not asking you to marry one of them tonight. I'm just saying if you could make it seem like things were headed in that direction. - Rex, Adam. - Oh God, this woman again. Brace yourself. - Cindy? - Aunt Claudia. - Cindy, is that you? - Yeah. Weren't you in London? - No, no, I finished that. But what are you doing in there? - It's not use. Morgan locked it. She has the key. - No worries, I have an idea. I need you to walk over to Lexi's closet. - Yeah. - Okay, walk over there now. - Why? - Just trust me, do it. - Okay. - Let me know when you get there. Are you there? - Yeah, I'm here. - Okay. Close the door. Look to your right. Look on the bottom. You see the first draw on the bottom on the right? - Yeah. - Okay. I need you to pull that. I need you to yank it all out. Your Dad kept that all for you. - Aunt Claudia! How did you get in here? - There's a door in the garden. - Everything is so beautiful. - It is, but there's one more thing that's beautiful. - What's this? - This belonged to your mom. Go, try it on. You look like your mom. Beautiful. But hold on, we're missing one thing. And this is for you. Go on. Let me see you. Stunning. You look stunning. Oh look, you're missing one more thing. Go get your earrings. Come on, let's go. You gotta go. I can't wait 'til Morgan sees you. - No, I don't want her to see me. - But why? - I just want this moment for my father. - Okay. Fair enough, let's do this. - What are you doing? Dad, I tried. I tried. - What does that mean? - They're psychos, Dad. And then their mom is just evil. Did you know that the ugly one could stick her whole foot in her mouth? - She's not that ugly. Let people see you together. The rumor mill will do the rest. Just talk to them a bit more. - Dad, I can't, just please, I'll do-- - Do it. Don't make a scene. - One night. - That's it. - Fine. - One night. - Oh my God! - Oh, so do you work out? - A little bit. - Oh, you look like you work out. - I'm suddenly wishing I did more cardio. - Sorry about my sister. She can be very forward. - What do you mean, forward? - You grab everyone. - Everyone? I'll show you forward. - You two need to-- - Forward! - Girls. I am so sorry about this, Adam. I will deal with you two later. Yes! - Sorry. - No, it was my fault. - No, really, I should have been watching where I was going, but I got... - I was gonna say sweet outfit. - Were you at the party? I don't think I've seen you before. - Must have been my Uber driver's first time in the area. I got a little bit lost. - It happens. - Adam, Rex! - I gotta get out of here. - I know the perfect spot. Come with me. - You think we're safe here? - For now. - It looks like you're trying to run away from something. - Aren't we all trying to run away from something? - What are you running away from? - Myself. What about you? - The company. My father. His expectations. I just wish we could have that one conversation that didn't revolve around the company or my father's assets. - There you are. Your father said I should take you home. Let's go. Let's go! You're gonna get me in a lot of trouble with your father. - Alright. - Oh Claudia, I didn't know you were here. - And what are you guys doing? - We're looking for Adam. It was supposed to be a secret? - Adam. Oh, yes, Rex's Adam. I think he went to the kitchen. - Thank you, Aunt Claudia. - They take this kingdom stuff very seriously. I need you to do the same. - Oh, you're still here. - Oh, it's always so nice to see you, Morgan. - And when are you leaving? - He wasn't in the kitchen. - Nor the dining room, hallway, or the bathroom. - Where have you been? - What are you talking about? - You know what I mean. You're gonna see. Come on, girls. - Did you enjoy yourself? - I mean, I got to sleep in a bed for the first time in months. - You know what I mean. - I'm not sure I do. I've been locked in here all night. - Let me pretend like I believe that. On second thought, let me not. What did you say to Adam? - I didn't say anything to him. Oh wait, am I still pretending I was locked in this room by my psychotic stepmother? - I do what needs to be done. - I've tried to find the good in you for so long. I just can't anymore. - You're breaking my heart. You know, I really tried to do my best for you. - I must have been sick that day. - You've just been so difficult. - Well I can't imagine. - We're closing on the deal later today at the luncheon. Then I'll let you out of this room and my life forever. - Why do we have to do this? - Where's Cinderella? - This is disgusting! - No, what's wrong? - Where is Cinderella? - What is going on here? This place is a mess. The kingdom's gonna be here in less than an hour. Pick all this up. Hurry up. - Adam, you made me move my schedule today by coming this early. Your father will be here in any minute and I still to get everything ready for the signature. What's going on? - I couldn't even sleep last night. I gotta find this girl from yesterday. - With one shoe? - Of course. - How do you know she'll even be here? I mean, she ran away last night. She was likely crashing the party. A Shareholders' Ball? Who's gonna crash an event like that. - Okay, so you're crazy about this girl. Did you even see her face, I mean without the mask? - Well, you interrupted us, remember? - What option did I have? - You did come out of this room and you know what? I'm gonna find that shoe. - You want my shoes? - We have shoes of our own. - Not the one that Adam's looking for. - Adam wears heals? - What? No! It seems that Cinderella has enchanted Adam and all we have to do is find the shoe and you will be the woman of his dreams. - I go first! - No, I'm the oldest. - And you know what? You will stay in here forever! - What are you doing, Adam? - There's this girl I met last night. - You're going to stop right now. We have business to attend to. - Dad, I have my own business to attend to. - What? I'm trying to secure your future. - I'm the only one in charge of my future. - He's never spoken to me in that tone. - Oh, I've done all this and nobody's here yet. - I'm here, Morgan. - What are you doing here? - I am a shareholder. - You bought one stock. - That entitles me to be here. - Oh, well terrific. So glad you're here. - Oh, I knew you'd say that Morgan. - Oh Adam, you found my shoe. - Your shoe? - It sure is, darling. Let me show you, let me show you. I'll show you. I know you're very excited. I'm just as excited, darling. Watch as it fits me. Give me one second. Give me one second, darling. It's gonna fit. - Hi Adam. Sissy, I don't think it fits you. It fits me, I'll show you. They're on. - What are you doing with Cinderella's shoe? - What? They are not. - Who's Cinderella? - Cinderella's the young girl who wore those shoes last night. - Where is she? - I know where she is. Grab that, let's go. - Oh. - She's in here. - What now? Are you gonna kick me out of the house? - No, it's me. - Who are you? - It's Adam. - Aunt Claudia? - Step away from the door. - Ah, come on. We have to go. They're about to sign. Let's go, let's go. - As the widow of the late Henry Perrault, Morgan Luscinia Perrault is going to formally sign over the company to Rex Windsor and Windsor Corporation. Today is the final vote on the matter. We now open the floor to discussion. - Oh behalf of my husband, may he rest in peace. - Are you proud of the way that you've treated his daughter? - What is she talking about? Teenagers. - She's talking about the fact that you locked her up last night and that your daughters never help her and that you have her clean the house all day long. - She was misbehaving. Henry would have wanted me to discipline her. - What gives you the right to lock me away? What gives you the right to sign away my father's company? - Well-- - I have the documents right here. The last will and testament of one Henry Perrault. - Let me see that. This is not my brother's signature. This is fake. - What? This woman doesn't know what she's talking about. - I know my brother's signature, Morgan, and this is not it. - Even if this is not Perrault's signature, this fine woman is still his widow. If there is not will then his assets should transfer to her. - That is not his signature. I don't care what she tells you. That's not his signature, that's a fake. Look at it, that's a fake signature. - Okay, I'll assess it. - You don't need to assess anything. That is a fake signature. - Here it is. - I'll need a little while to read through this and then we can get back to the vote. - I'm sorry if this ruins things with your father. - That's fine. Do what you gotta do. - So the will is fairly simple. Everything passes to Cinderella when she turns 18. - She's only 16. I'm under control until then. - Actually no. Henry Perrault wrote that Claudia Perrault-- - What?! - Should be in charge of the trust until Cinderella turns 18. - Yes. Yes. Yes. - It can't be. - Yes it can be, Morgan. - I have no more to say. - You need to leave. - You can't do this to me. - Yes I can. - I live here too. - No, you don't. Get out. Get out. - Let's go, girls. - You did it. You did it. You did it. - Come with me. - Go. - And this tree has been growing ever since. - It's nice. - Yeah, I planted these myself. Purple ones remind me of my mom. - So I guess we won't be doing business together? I don't know about that. - You know, my father actually wanted me to marry one of the Perrault girls. - That's probably out the window. He doesn't seem too fond of me. - How about I take you out sometime? - I could do that. - Well, I think-- Tomorrow night okay? - That's fine. - I'll see you. - Things are gonna be a little different now. - I have to tell you I'm very excited. I've been waiting for this for a very long time. Ah, there she is. Are we ready to make this merger happen? - Definitely, let's do this, - Let's do this. And I finally understood. It had nothing to do with my stepsisters or my stepmother. Only I can stand up for myself. - Congratulations, you are now the President of Windsor Corporation. - Thank you. - I think this deserves a toast. Yes? To my beautiful niece and to my brother. Cheers. So. - If you could please excuse me. I think I have something left to do. - Okay. - Hurry up ladies. - Hey ladies. Come on, you're gonna be late for the party. Because nothing compares to a new beginning. Actually, scratch that. An enchanted beginning.
