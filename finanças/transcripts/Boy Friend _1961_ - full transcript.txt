You Tube - Video Running Time 02:17:50 You Tube search name - Boy Friend (1961) Superhit Classic Movie | बॉय फ्रेंड | Shammi Kapoor, Madhubala I pray to God his son is found. Who are they? I've been seeing them for years. They come here for worship on the 2nd of January each year. He lives in Ambala, Thakur Harcharan Singh. This happened 22 years ago. Their elder son, Madan was lost. And has not yet been found. That's why they come here. They even promised... They would cover the temple dome with gold when their son is found. Here is your locket. You are released today. This is the second time you've been imprisoned in Simla jail for theft. Once, under your real name, Madan. The second time as Shyam. Changing the name doesn't hide the crime. You look like you belong to a good family. It would be best if you gave up these jobs. Yes, sir. What does your heart say, will my Madan be found? I am positive Madan will surely be found. Mother, I won't come home tonight. - Why? - I have to catch a killer. What a cop you are. You find killers but can't find your brother! The fact is that brother's case is now very old. So what? You may make an attempt. I am trying- I too am eager to meet him. This is a blood relation. How can Sunil be quiet? Someday he'll surely find his elder brother. When? When I am no more? - Why do you say that? - I've lost all hope. God knows where Madan would be and in what condition... Drink some water. Now how do you feel? What are you looking at? Are you Madan? What? No. My name is Shyam. No. I met you in Simla jail last year. You are Madan. You are Shantilal! But what a state you're in. I'm suffering for my deeds. Poverty, sickness... Many a time, I tried to kill myself but life didn't leave me. Everything will be all right. I'm going to Bombay. - Come with me. - To Bombay? - Yes. I have two daughters who live there. Sangita and Sushma. - Where do they live? - I don't know. It's been many years since I left home. One night I burdened them with my sins and quietly left home. I'll find both of them but you must come with me. I can't face them. Not till I die. What did I give my children as a father? Poverty, debts... Yes a debt of 50000. 50000? That's a small sum. Don't worry. Together we'll clear this debt. Thank you very much. If you want to do me a favour... Just do this much... If you find Sangita and Sushma... Tell them your father has sent you blessings. And tell them to pay the debt of Thakur Harcharan Singh. My soul will be at peace. I will do this but where will you wander in this state? Lie down at ease and go to sleep. You have to come with me to Bombay. Go to sleep. Rest assured. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hey! There was a man lying here. Where's he? He's gone. Got off. Where did he get off? At the last station. - Hello. ls your name Sangita? - No. - Then it must be Sushma. - Not that either. Forgive me. Loafer! - Sangita, what are you doing here? - Nothing at all. - Excuse me! Hey! - Loafer! I say, listen! You'll make such a name on stage that columns will be written on you! You will be famous! The real success will be when we'll pay off the debt Dad owes you. Forget about it, Sushma. Your father was a good friend of mine. And I don't even recall ever giving a loan to your father. - But it's our duty. - I'll be glad the day... your sister becomes a big stage heroine. She surely will, with your blessings. Now we'll take leave. Good day. Director, now we only need a hero. Who can be the hero opposite Sangita on stage. He should be young, handsome and 6 feet tall. I'm waiting for that. If I find a good boy... I can start rehearsals for my play, Boy friend, immediately. I challenge that if I find a good hero... He'll add to the glory of Boy friend. Then hurry up and put up posters, place advertisements in newspapers! I've put up posters. I'll send news to the papers now. Today was great fun! Loafer! I'll have you thrashed! Go away! Terrific, Shantilal! What girls you've got! - My necklace! - What's wrong? - Mother! What happened? - Your mom's necklace has been stolen! Everyone stand here. Check the lanes. Let none escape! - Good day inspector. - When did you arrive? - Just today. - But you don't want to live honestly I've always wanted to be honest but circumstances... Shyam, you're wasting your life in this way. I don't know why I sympathize with you. You're a pick pocket and I'm an inspector. But you look like you're connected to some good family. Why don't you pick a good job? Enroll me in the police force. I'd do it but your record is bad. But you can't know a man's heart by his record. - I want to search you. - Sure, inspector. You'll search me all life and I'll let you all my life. Try to be a good human being. I am trying, sir. It's an expensive one. Your life is made if you sell it. Life is not made by sinful money. If you are honest, the world will respect you. I'll give it to Inspector Sunil. What are you doing? Constable, I'm looking for Miss Sangita's house. - Do you know her? - Yes, very well. Don't you believe me? Take me there and I'll give you proof. Come on. I'll just show you. - What is it? Police...! - You are Shantilal's daughter? - He's sent a message for you. Is your name Sangita? - Yes. - Is it true? - Absolutely! - Absolutely true. - Come in. Keep her away from me! She's turned me into a real loafer! If you hadn't supported me, I'd spend the night with the constable! So you've come to spend the night? - He's a friend of father's. - Father's friend? - Yes. - Come in. Please be seated. - Where did you meet father? - In the train. Don't worry, he was fine. Why didn't you bring him along? I was but I fell asleep en route and he got off at some station. How can I help it? What did you talk to him? We spoke of a number of things but most significantly... He was talking of Thakur's debt. That's what I'm trying. Maybe you don't know, I dance on stage... only so I can repay the debt. I hope the debt is paid. I came to give you the message in this rain. Good night. Just a minute. How will you go in this rain? - You won't get a taxi. - I'll walk. You are father's friend. Brought his message in this rain... - We are grateful. - I'll go... - No, consider this your house. Get a blanket and pillow for him from inside. Right away. Believe me I'll go home. You are being formal... You can sleep quite comfortably. First take off your coat. - Why must I take it off? - Will you sleep with it on? I can sleep in it... - It's wet and you'll catch a cold. - No, I never catch colds. What's special about it? Is it very expensive? - That's not true... - Why don't you take it off? I'll take it off. It's not expensive. - I'll keep it here. - Here's the blanket. - Your coat... - What are you doing? - Dusting it off. - Not hard, it's old. Might tear Then I'll stitch it. Go to sleep. - But where are you taking it? - To dry. - Go to sleep. - Go to sleep. You go here. Go to sleep. - You...? Water. Thanks. If you need anything else, ask for it right now. No, I won't need anything. Go to sleep. I need a cigarette. - I'll get it. - Pardon...? - Here's your cigarette. - Thank you. Now go to sleep. - Where's the guest? - Guest...? Can't be in my pocket. Must be where you asked him to sleep. The blanket and pillow is lying here. Where's he gone so early? The coat. In the night, he didn't want to take the coat off. Now he's left it here. - Funny man. - He hasn't forgotten it. He's left a return ticket. - What? - He needs an excuse to return. You don't know the boys of today. - He is a loafer! - You won't change! I'm wondering how to return the coat. - I didn't ask his name. - Ask him when he comes to take the coat. As well as his address. Don't be mad. Go back. You're returning this necklace? Go and sell it. You'll make your life. Honesty is very precious. Work hard. Do something worthwhile. Wealth will be at your feet. Go. - Excuse me... - Who...? - Is Inspector Sunil in? - He is but who are you? - I'm Shyam. - But what do you want? I have to talk to him. But he says I must ask the name and work, then send guests in. You told me your name but what work do you have? - Do I have to tell you? - Yes. I've come to return a stolen necklace. - Stolen necklace? - Yes. Shyam? How did you come by? That day, you told me to try and become a good human being. So today... What's the matter? I came to prove my honesty. But God is not in favour. - Don't blame God. - All right. If I'd got the love of parents in my childhood, I wouldn't be a thief! Doesn't matter. Someday I'll still prove my honesty to you. I'll wait for that day. He tried being honest! Banwarilal hit the prize. Why one necklace? My Lord, I can sacrifice 100 on you. But right now there's no such necklace in my shop... that would be worthy of being worn by you. - Pardon? - You have a short fuse. This number too turned out to be wrong! No problem. I have thought it over. Someday I'll clean you out. - Yes sir? - What are you doing here? - Cleaning the cobwebs. - On the locker? Yes. Spiders make cobwebs on man forget vaults. Shut up. Mother wants you. Good day inspector. So, how are you? Are you happy? Whenever I want to talk to you, some job crops up. I'll get back and talk to you. - Sunil here. - I know that. Say something new. - Today is Sunday. - That too is old news. What difference would it make if it were Monday? I meant I have a holiday. Where will you meet me? I can't meet you. Anything else, warden? You are strange. I get leave just once a week. I know that but I'm not your constable. I too must have time. My exams are drawing close. I have to study. One day won't matter. I'm going shopping with Sangita. The program can be canceled. You too can get canceled. What did you say? What? The criminal is caught! Put him in the cell. I'll come at 5 PM. - Got that, constable? - Constable? What nonsense? I'm not speaking French. I said I'll come at 4. What? What did you say, Nirmala? Your mother broke her leg! And father isn't home. Now what will happen? Take her to the hospital. I'll wait for you at home. Come soon. Please hurry. You were to go shopping with me. You tell me what to do. Nirmala's mother broke a leg! - It broke! - Yes. - So? She's coming home to take me. - Then even I won't go shopping. - What? No problem. You stay home. I'll go shopping. You go to the hospital with her. - I got it. - What? You will go to see the broken leg and I must go shopping. When did you arrive? Boy, get a special coffee. I came yesterday but reached my room today. - These are your... - Money for what? Our last year's balance was 75 rupees. Keep some and return some. You have a good memory. Pay it all together next year. What you say is right but the angle all wrong. What's it? I mean your decorated room lies vacant all year round. Give it to me. I want to get my son married this year. What if I intend to get married this year? - Then you take my hotel. - I'm not joking. - I will marry this year. - Really? Tell me her name. - I'll meet her parents. - You're worried abut the parents! First let me get acquainted with her. I'll be back. Wanted urgently a young handsome boy. To play the lead opposite our new discovery, Sangita. Meet Thakur Har... I want a boy not a girl. Who can be presented as hero opposite Sangita. He should be young, handsome and 6 feet tall. Young, handsome, 6 feet tall. - May I sit? - Yes. - What's your name? - The name comes after work. For the time being I'm a non entity but people call me Shyam. - Have you ever been on stage? - What a thing to ask! Any man will say he can act like Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar. Any man will say he can act like Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar. But my standard is higher. Kalidas' Dushyant, Shakespeare's Othello... And Ceaser's Brutus... who loved Ceaser's power not his friendship. - Can you dance? - Dance in such a style. When I dance Manipuri, the weather dances, party comes to life. Tandav puts people under my spell. If I dance the rock and roll, I turn people crazy. Regarding songs, I can sing light, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, lrani. - Ask me something else. - Wonderful! But you'll have to give a test of all that you just said. I'm ready. What say I present? Acting, singing or dancing? You'll have to go to the dance master. The dance master is here, sir. Sir, come along. I don't understand what to do! We've found the man we wanted! We should sign him for life! - This is our new hero, Shyam. - Hello. Nobody would have ever seen such a good couple on stage. Director, start rehearsals. Our first show will be in Simla. I am sure the pair of Shyam and Sangita will raise a storm in Simla! Every corner will resound with the success of our play, Boyfriend! Begin the preparations. Sangita and Shyam, you too. Good day. Good day. Congratulations. Hello, good day. You know me yet you didn't wish me. Most tall men are fools but this doesn't apply to me. I'm an honorable man. If you were so sensible, that night you wouldn't have behaved so! - What did I do? - Forgot so soon? You came like a guest and left like a thief! - Is this your decency? - You should have told me. I'd have apologized right then. I have this good quality of accepting my mistake right away. Why did you leave your coat at our place? You're being silly. I didn't leave it at a stranger's house. Your home is my home. My home is yours. Any objections? I did object, severely but... Now onwards there should be no anger between us on any issue. You are my stage partner. And believe me, our pair will raise a storm in the world. - What do you think? - The thought is sweet. Hope it comes true. Lightning agrees with me. You are as quick as lightning. I defeat lightning in every way. Eating, drinking, walking, wandering, cutting... I mean cutting coats, pants... Cutting noses... I'm the best cutter of this city. You are so funny! Where do you live? In every corner of the city. What do you mean? I mean sometimes at the Taj, other times at Raj. Or Marine Drive or Nagpada. If I'm in the mood I even go to the government home. You are joking! Maybe because you've never had any responsibilities. What responsibility? I came to this world alone and thus I'll leave. Why don't you get married? Yes? I haven't found a girl. - If you find her? - I'll get married. - Any one you know? - Yes. - How is she? She's educated, nice. That's what won't do. I want a girl tall as a tree. Fat as a buffalo. Dark as a crow and dumb as a fool! You're joking again! Because I don't want to fall in the trap of marriage! - Why? - What times these are! Every girl is running after her boy friend. Every boy is seen with a girl friend. - Is it good? - What's wrong in friendship? This means you want to play with her feelings. You may assume that. Then keep this in mind, no girl will want you. What do you think of girls? Where are you going? Listen... You've taken offense! Don't take it personally. Listen to me... Good heavens! Rascal! Scoundrel! Don't you have eyes? He has no shame! Shameless! Stupid! At least give me a hand! Ruined my vegetables! God! How did you come here? You have high temperature! Get up and come in. I kept looking for you. Come... Lie down. You are terribly ill. I'll get a doctor. Don't leave me and go. I'm here just for a few moments. - My daughters, Sangita... - Both are well. - Very well... - Lie down. I'll call them. No... don't bring them. I'm a blot on their lives. Sinner, Vagabond... A sentenced father. I can't show them my face. I have very little time. Pay back my debt to Thakur. That will be done. Don't worry. - Look after my kids. - You don't have to say that. Don't worry. Give this to her... the last memento. Why do you miss your father when this Geeta is in your hands? It will always remind you of your duty. Pay attention. Your life is going towards a new destination. Success awaits you on the stage of Simla. I'll be so happy when the public will sway to your performance. And the stage will resound with applause! Be brave, everything will be fine. Your father's debt will be paid and his soul will rest in peace. He is right. We have come to your city of Simla with 2 artistes. The name of our play is Husband and Wife. Our hero always addresses his wife as sweetheart. Films have a tremendous impact of youngsters. Our youngsters imitate film actors. In our play of today... we have tried to show that this young man wants to be a hero. But his wife gets annoyed. As her husband, he wants to please her. He sings a song on stage to bring his wife back home. So this is our stage play, Husband and Wife. - Congratulations director. - Same to you. Your sister performed very well on stage. She always does. What's your contribution to it? Where has that young, handsome 6 foot tall lad vanished? - He's not to be seen. - Must be in Sangita's room. He's not there. I checked. - Where's your hero? - Where is he? He must have gone to look for a new goat to fleece. How can he leave his business? I don't interfere in your matters so don't meddle in my business. He's my hero and I want to earn millions from him! Someday you'll be cheated. He's a Vagabond, a cheat! He's a very good boy! I don't know why I ever took Sangita skating. Had I not taken her, her foot wouldn't have broken. What I planned and what's happened. I'm responsible for this! Don't say that. It's fate. Nobody can change that. If you lose heart, how will Sangita face it? - Where is she now? - In the room upstairs. You...? - Why are you surprised? - No... Aren't you happy to see me? I... I thought you'd forgotten me... Silly girl! Why did you think like this? That's how the world is. People worship the rising sun. Now what's left in my life? I can neither walk nor dance. Did you think I loved your steps? You think I love your body! No. I love your soul. Do I still mean the same to you? You are the same Sangita with whom I would dance. And sing... But... now I can never dance with you on stage. Do you think I joined the theater to sing and dance? No. I came for you, Just for you. Trust me. I will love you till the last breath of life. Forget that crutch. I'm glad that wooden support of yours broke. Why? Else how would I get a chance to hold you? In any case, you are a big help to me. You are like God for me. God...? How can you say that? What do you know about me? Do you think I need to know more? Maybe you've misunderstood me. - I can never misunderstand you. - Such trust? If I didn't trust you, wouldn't I have died for my leg? What if your leg gets better? - I'll think I'm dreaming. - This dream can be real. - How? - God is merciful. Your leg will get better. My leg will get better? - Will I be able to walk? - And dance too. I'll be able to dance. Father's debt will be paid! Good day, Banwarilal. Glad to see you. You're a very honest man! You've come to pay back the 100 bucks I lent you! - And I'm broke today. - Talk of thousands. Lord! You are merciful! - Some cold drink, lemon...? - Listen to me... I'm in love with a girl. So am I. - But she is unwell. - So is mine. Maybe. I want to buy her a gift that will amuse her. Tell me if she's fair or dark... Fair. Fairer than the moon! Then I'm yours and so is everything in this shop! I'll show you something that will blow you and her away! - Show it to me fast! - In a moment. Shyam will swoon at seeing this. - This necklace...? - It's the Kohinoor! I've studded pieces of the heart. What are you looking at? I've seen it before. You may have seen the design! - I saw it myself... - I'm not saying your eyes deceive you. This is a market. 100 necklaces are made and sold everyday. This is a very honest and truthful business. You're no stranger that I'll sell you a risky item. Don't worry and take it. Don't hesitate at all. - I agree if you insist. - Then I do. - How much does it cost? - What can I tell you? You're a good man. Give me the cost, which is 2000. - Only 2000? - Just 2000. - 2000 for a friend? - I said, only 2000. You're a decent man. Take this. It's 500 rupees. That's all! I'll call Sampat that his money is lying here. Take the 250 bucks. May I come in? - Thakur sent me. - Come in. - Good day Sushma. - How did you come by? It's nothing much but it's important I'm his old manager. I don't go to his office or his home. But on and off he asks me to do some job which is difficult. You talk too much. Come to the point. It's nothing much but it's important This house and the items in it do belong to you. Do you mean to say it's pawned to Thakur? It's been this way for years. Manager too is with him for years. Viewing things from business, I've come here for the first time. I've brought a court order for 50000. How can we pay so much money? It's nothing much but it's important If you don't pay the money this order will be activated. And you'll have to vacate this house in 24 hours. In 24 hours? Don't we need some time to raise such a large sum? That's well said but it's nothing much but it's important Give me 2000 as interest tomorrow so I can shut Thakur for a month. We don't even have that much. I can give you 4 days to get that money too. But even in 4 days where will the money come from? That I don't know. Either you pay 50000... Or the interest of 2000 or vacate this house. I'll return in 4 days. The show won't stop because of one Sangita. The curtain will rise and the play will go on. One Sangita doesn't matter. But we need time to find another girl. Start the search. And start rehearsal of Boyfriend! We have Shyam! - Forget Shyam. - How can I? You're the hero of this stage. We're now looking for a new heroine. You may keep your new heroine. - Meaning? - Ask your heart. Where's the sympathy? The sweet talk with Sangita? She means nothing to you. You only wanted her dancing feet. You wanted to sell them and make millions. But today when she's helpless you've discarded her mercilessly. And asked for your loan too! Is this your humanity? - Do you know who you're talking to? - Yes I do. A very big man. Who plays with lives of people. Sunil was right. You're a thief, loafer and a cheat! If I'm a thief, you're the spirit of decency. If I'm a loafer, you're the upholder of the law. If I'm a cheat... I could answer this slap... Get out! I will go but you keep in mind... Life has many twists. Someday your life will take such a turn... that will leave you spinning! Your face will turn pale. And then you'll go back to the same Sangita who is helpless. That day you will remember this 6 foot handsome man. You'll see, you will be free from morning to evening. Are you drunk? I've got a client. I've come to buy your shop. Will you sell it? - Some new bird...? - Don't put your hand in! I've found the vault number. Let my partner come. Then see my miracle! If I don't change the shape of your shop, I'm not Sampat! Will you have a cigar? Your Pop never had one! My master gets it from abroad. Takes a puff... like so... Excuse me... This is priceless but I'm selling it cheap. It is good. - Son, what are you doing? - Buying this necklace. It's only 2000. It's very good but we don't want it. - Why? - I said, we don't want it. I want to sell this necklace. - I'm very worried. - At what price will you sell? - 2000. - For rupees 2000? - Why? - Don't ask me. I have some problems. Just buy it. Give it to your wife. She'll be very happy. You desperately need the money. I'll buy it. Excuse me. I'm sorry I can't buy this. - Got a match? - No, inspector. You seem worried. Sir, if my father was a millionaire like yours... I could wipe away thousands of worries in a flash. Why did you quit the job? Why don't you ask your Dad? He's really upset today. Won't you eat tonight? - I'm not hungry. - Hunger won't wait so late. Why didn't you come home early? What can I say? My work is such. What work keeps you out of the house late nights? - Mister Shyam! - What's the matter? I don't know. He just came and left. He must be worried. He can't bear to see us in this state. - You...? - You wanted to wed your son. - So late in the night... - You can take my room. All the furniture in it is yours. I only want 2000 rupees. - Just 2000? - Yes. Here it is. - Do you want me to give anything signature...? - No. I trust you. Go. Thank you very much. He's a good boy. We couldn't arrange for the money. We are vacating the house. - Then I'm sorry. I'll get the men today. - Sure, please do. I swear I was thinking of you! But come back in the night. Such jobs are not done in the day. - What jobs? - You are strange! There's just one job... I've come to meet Thakur. You can meet him all your life. Meet me today. Such occasions don't come easy. I've memorized the vault number. - Let's clean it up tonight. - Who is it? Who are you? And what do you want? Yes. I've come to pay the interest of your kindness. - Interest? - Yes. Sangita has sent 2000 bucks. So you've come here as her lawyer. If this is what decency means in your language, so be it. Here's the amount. Hand me the receipt. Get a receipt for 2000 rupees. - Where did you get this money? - It's not stolen. Rest assured. Count it well. It's not too late. If you regret the past... You can return to my stage. You forget this maybe a business for you. But it has emotional value for me. If I return to stage, it will be with Sangita. That day will never come. It will. I'm sure. Do you remember life has hundreds of twists. Someday your life will take such a twist that you'll forget business! You will value emotions. And that day... You will remember this 6 foot handsome man. Now what are you thinking of? I'd warned you earlier. We are packing but where will we go? We will find refuge somewhere in this wide world. You look after those who have none other. A receipt for 2000 rupees! See... who kept this here? A receipt of the interest money of rupees 2000! But who paid it? Who could it be other than Shyam? Doctor, will Sangita's leg be better? The case is serious but I assure you she will walk again. If that happens, believe me, I'll be ever grateful. I'll have to perform a major operation. - It will cost a lot. - Don't worry about that. I'll get all the money you need. But it's imperative she get better. - How much money...? - At least 5000. I'll get it. I'll get the money and you'll treat her! Sangita must dance on stage again. That's my greatest desire. Bring the patient here after 2 days at 11 o'clock. Thank you very much. No, I can't take this money. How long will you bring pleasure to my ruined life? To my last breath. Did you think I'd be happy wearing this necklace? No, it's looking more beautiful round your neck. Why did you have to buy such an expensive necklace? Who told you it's expensive? Do you know it's cost? Just rupees 2 and four annas. I bought it from the footpath. But I'm sure its' value has gone up to 5000 when you wore it. You're an angel! I've often told you not to call me an angel. Call me anything but angel. - Then shall I say the truth? - Yes. - You won't feel offended. - No. - Think it over. - I have. Then listen. You are a big thief! - Thief? - Yes. - What have I stolen? - Nothing? - No. I haven't. - No...? - Why are you scared? - I'm not. You have stolen my heart. It's you? Please come in. How did you come by so early in the morning? - I've come to ask you something. - That's an old habit. Will you ask me questions all your life or give an answer too? - It's very important. - Everything is important for cops. We always make small talk. What is your question? What's your relation to Shyam? - Why? - First answer my question. - Shall I? - Yes. - Then listen... He is my boy friend. We are terribly in love. We'll be married in 2 days. Will you attend? In fact, I've come to say, he's not a good man. Envious? The problem is you're the only good man in this world. And the one who helps us is bad! Why don't you understand? He has a bad police record. What do you know about him? You can't even imagine what I know! Don't meddle in my family affairs! Why are you fighting? What's the matter, inspector? It's nothing. Actually... Why are you staring at her? Look at me. - Where did you get this necklace? - This necklace...? Do you want to buy it for me? Who gave you this necklace? - What do you mean? - It's a stolen necklace. - No! - Oh, yes. The police has been looking for it for days. - Take your necklace. - That I will. But the necklace is not as important as the one who stole it. Tell me who gave it to you? - If I refuse to tell... - I'll be forced to arrest both of you I will not give any names. Why are you quiet? Your silence can endanger the lives of both. Forget that I'm Sunil. I'm an inspector on duty. Till I find who stole this necklace from my mother and gave it to... .your sister, I can't free you. How strange... The necklace that adorned your mother's neck is... .now a sin in my sister's neck! Inspector, you have got back what belonged to you. For God's sake, don't push the matter. This matter won't end till the thief is behind bars... I beg you, for my love... This is not a love story. The law has to present the culprit in court. Try to understand. I don't want you to go to court. Tell me everything. I can't do anything for you. You can do nothing for me. You can do nothing for me. Then listen... it's the same man you know very well! I knew it! Did Shyam come here? I swear he hasn't come to this shop for many days. He will come here. Listen to me carefully. If you don't inform the police, I'll have your shop permanently closed! I've understood. I need something! I need 5000 bucks immediately. Sometimes you want 2000 or 5000. This is Sevakram's shop not the Punjab National Bank! You can make the arrangements if you wish! You yourself can arrange it! Money runs after you and you run in front of it. Sampat has seen his master's vault number. It contains millions of rupees. If you wish, tonight... get it? I'll go and meet Sampat. What stolen booty have you come to give me today? Stolen booty? You think I love your money. - I love your gifts. - Why are you talking like this? You think I'm a stage dancer! Who adorns herself with your money! Who embraces your gifts! I'm not that kind of woman! If I didn't have to pay off father's debt, I'd never dance on stage! No girl from a decent family would like to dance on stage. But I never said you're that kind of a woman. Then why did you put a stolen necklace in my neck? Why are you silent? You've repaid me well for my love. How do I tell you that I haven't stolen that necklace? I know you won't believe it today. Anyway... I'll surrender to the police. No! You didn't try to think... I won't let you go up. Get out of my way or Shyam will escape! 2 young girls live here alone I can't permit you to enter my bedroom Hurry or Shyam will make a run for it! You check the terrace and you go downstairs! He escaped but left behind evidence. - Where did you find it? - On the terrace. It's so sad that you're still trying to save him. His crimes and sentence will keep on increasing. Hand him over to the police if you wish his welfare. That is best for you too. Don't forget that Shyam is a thief, Vagabond and cheat. Thief, Vagabond and cheat. You are very lucky. You've found yourself a man like inspector Sunil. He comes from a decent, noble family. Nothing is lost even now. This was my lost son's locket. I well remember it was in Madan's hand. This very locket. You had bought it. 22 years ago from the Ambani garden. Try to recall. Look at it carefully. - How is it? - Very good, Papa! - But what is it called? - It's called a locket. - What did you buy? - I bought a locket! - I too want a locket! - We'll buy you one too. Since I bought one for you, I'll have to buy one fro Sunil too. Come on. Why don't you speak? Do you remember? The eyes of a father can be deceived. Not a mother's love. Did you hear, Sunil? Shyam is our son! - A thief, Vagabond... - Whatever, he's our son! Go and get him. Go! Please tell Sunil. What are you thinking of? What Will I think? The thief, Vagabond and cheat turned out to be my own son. Go, Sunil. Somehow catch him. Good day. I wish to meet Miss Sangita. - But you... - I'm called Gurbachan Singh! - I've come from Simla. - You may come from Himalaya... - What do you want from her? - I've come to see her. This is not a gurudwara. You are mistaken. I'm not mistaken! You are trying to waylay me! - You're very naughty! - Talk respectfully. - Sangita is not home. - You've gotten angry. Read this. What's written? Why didn't you say you own Simla Stage? - Please come in. - I say, good day! He owns the Simla Stage Company. He's come to meet you. Please sit down. - Please sit down. - Of course I will! I swear, Gurbachan Singh you are very lucky! You are treated so well. Isn't it daughter? Am I lying? - Sir! - Swear, my name is Gurbachan Singh! From Simla! Recognize me? Oh yes! I met you in Simla hotel. - Am I lying? - Not at all sir! - He's one of Simla's... - Enough! - Too much praise is bad. - What can I do for you? Swear by God, I'm here to serve you! If I can help you, my life is fulfilled! - What do you want to say? - What's there to say? My company is not short of funds. We only need a heroine. If you join us, our problems will be solved. You give your acceptance and our hurdles are crossed! - Am I lying, dear? - No sir. - Yes? - I'm not worth the stage. Don't you worry. We'll solve everything. I'll make your leg stage worthy Yes, dear. Did I lie? - No. - Why should you bother? I don't understand this. I just want to help you. I've come to earth to help people. Dear, am I lying? Not at all sir. But why do you object? - Why do you want to ruin matters? - Ask her. No, Sushma. I'm scared. If my leg doesn't get better? It's my job to see that. I swear by God! You just get yourself treated. My name is Gurbachan Singh. - Just sign this. - I won't sign anything - I won't keep you in the dark. - There's no darkness. My name is Gurbachan! I'll get you treated too. Dear girl, tell her. - Sign it. - But... - Your leg will get better. It will. Take the Lord's name and put your signature here. Great! Swear you are fortunate! Wherever you go, you're treated well. Now my honor is in your hands. Take these 5000 rupees from me and begin your treatment. I'll meet you in the hospital. What a noble man you are! I'm not noble! It's the Lord's mercy. - Am I lying, dear? - No sir. I'll take leave. Goodbye. Good bye. Praise be the Lord. Open your eyes, son. You hit me hard. Hello, Sangita. - Who was he? - The owner of a theater. He has signed a contract with Sangita. But how will you work? That's what's worth noting. Your father too is an owner... And this is another who is treating Sangita's leg! Congratulations, Sangita. He really is a good man. Sangita is fine! Her leg is normal! I'm very happy! Congratulations, your leg is fine. - Sir... - Gurbachan.. - I've come... - From Simla. - Thank you very much. - Sir is here. - Good day. - Take a seat. Congratulations. - My leg is normal now. - I had already told you. If I had wished anything else, it would have come true. - Do I lie? - Not at all. I can never forget your favour. There's no obligation. This is all thanks to God! Sit down, sir. - You are an angel. - Angel...! I'm no angel. You are being too kind. I'm a sinner. - Am I lying, dear? - No sir. Not at all. Now I want you to get well soon. Let's hurry to Simla for such a quick drama that Simla will be agog! Who is the hero of your stage? We'll find one. Yes. Or I'll quickly become one! What do you think? - You...? - You own the company. You can play all the roles. You're my only clever child. - I too am your... - What are you saying? I have just one daughter, bright future... I'm your slave. - Pardon? - I'll sign on a blank paper if you don't trust me. You can write whatever you want in it. Am I lying...? - What's wrong? - Nothing. I've sold my life here. I'll meet you in Simla. The door is here. Where are you going? How does it matter if the window or door is here or there. Let me go! What does your father lose? - It's very high. - I am very tall! Let go! - Stop! - Inspector... - Who was it? - Shyam! Who else? Stop or I'll shoot! I say, stop! Stop or I'll shoot! - Sir, we didn't find him. - Let's go back. Driver, come on. I'll close down your shop permanently. Understood? Understood! - Good day. - Good day. Good day. Lord! Good Lord! Good day. Welcome. Sit down. Mister Shyam... I am your boy... - You're not with the police? No, I work for Sewakram. - Then why are you following me? - My master has asked you to see him. - Why? - Because you want 5000 bucks. He said the cash is ready. - Come and get it. - Go and tell Sevakram. I don't need his money. Shyam is dead. I've given up bad deeds. Go and tell him that! - He will beat me up... - If you don't go, I will! First drink some milk. I've been waiting for long. What happened? Nothing father. - Shyam escaped once again. - Got away again? Now what happens? Mother, we haven't given up. But he can be arrested sooner if father so desires. That's what I want! Tell me what I can do. You will have to go to Sangita once. - To Sangita? - Yes. You will have to bring her to stage. Bring her to stage? But why...? - To arrest Shyam. - To arrest Shyam? But what has Shyam's arrest got to do with her? It is related. Sangita means the world to Shyam. Whatever he has done so far is only for Sangita. He stole the necklace for her. Sold his house to save her house. He committed theft in our house to treat her leg. So that Sangita can return to the world of theater. If Sangita performs on stage, Shyam will surely come to see her. Shyam will come to see her. Yes father. You will get your son, I'll get my culprit. Yes, you'll get your culprit. He was right. Life has many twists. Someday life will take such a turn that you will be shocked. Your face will turn pale. That day you'll go back to Sangita who is helpless today because of you! That day you will think of this handsome, 6 foot man. You will go back to Sangita. That day you will think of this handsome, 6 foot man. Who...? sir! - Good day. - Thakur... - Please come in. Congratulations. I'm very glad to see you normal. Who else would be happy. Please take a seat. Thakur has come to our house. - Good day. - Good day. Now you don't have any trouble with your foot? Is your theater sad without my sister? Now forget about that. I've come for some work. Why did you come? You could have sent the manager? We'll vacate this house as soon as we find another. - This is not regarding the house. - Then what is it about? What other relation do we share? He has come home and we don't treat guests in this manner. But he taught us this behavior! But we won't do it. Or what will be the difference between him and us? Forget about that. I am very embarrassed. It's now that I realize how small the world is Money does not always help. Man does need another man. I need your help. My help? What am I worthy of? How do I say it? You'll have to perform on stage once more. - On stage? - No, My sister won't dance in your theater! Miss Sangita, you can bring my hopes to life again. My family would be highly obliged. This is need not business. Forgive me but I can't help you. Don't say that! Your acquiescence can bring back something... that I lost 22 years ago. Forget that I'm Thakur! Forget that I'm a businessman! It's a question of just one show! This is the receipt of the debt your father owed me. Nothing due. Now this house is yours. Everything is yours. I want just one show. We don't want anything. Keep this paper with you! - We will leave this house. - No, Sushma. I will dance for one show. If father's debt can be cleared with just one show... the house father built will be ours, then I'll dance for a show! Begin preparations for the show. I'll be eternally grateful! Shyam will come. He surely will! He hasn't come as yet and I don't think he will come. Hurry up! The first bell has rung. - Congratulations! It's a house full! - House Full! Thakur! Sir! How did you slip down the stairs? You should have been careful. Telephone the doctor and ask him to come soon. How terrible! Now what will happen? The house is full! - What's wrong with Sangita? - Fell off the stairs and has a sprain! Sprain? Now what happens? - Who will dance on stage? - That's what I'm thinking! It's past nine! I've rung the first bell! You sit with Sangita. I'll arrange something. - What is it? - My honour is in your hands. - What are you saying? - Sangita has a sprain. I had warned you that she shouldn't dance now. You insisted and she agreed. But if you dance instead of Sangita, I'll be grateful! I can't do this. - Find another girl. - Who could be better than you? Right now my honour is in your hands, save it. Else people will break the chairs and set the curtains on fire! I just want today's show! No, I won't appear on stage. Sangita agreed to appear on stage once to pay her father's debt. Think of me as your father and give me one show as charity. I am sorry you could not see Sangita on stage. That's my misfortune. Shyam has been arrested! I knew you'd arrest me someday. Do you mean to say, you are innocent? - As if you'd believe me? - No doubt about that. If you were innocent, why did you run away from Sangita's house? I had to run for somebody's helpless life. If I hadn't run away that day, the necklace for which you... arrest me today, you would have right then. Do you know what would happen then? Sangita would be a cripple all her life. It's my misfortune that I could neither please the law nor my love. Do your duty. My son! My child! Where had you gone, my baby? I waited for you for years! I went to every temple for you! Does anyone leave like this? Now I won't leave you for a minute! Meet your son. See, he's grown so tall! You are mistaken. My name... my name is not Madan. It's Shyam. You are not my son. Aren't you related to me? No. Then... that locket? Where is that locket? Show him that locket. Isn't this yours? Your father bought it for you in your childhood. Try to recall, my child! He bought it for you. You were very small then. I'd taken you and Sunil to the market. I bought it and slipped it on your wrist myself. Do you remember? You're making a mistake in recognizing me. I'm not your son, Madan. Where did you find this locket? I stole it from somebody. Can you tell us from whom? Who was he? You know inspector, nobody asks for names before picking pockets. Let's go, inspector. My child! My son, Madan! My child! Sun! Mother! My baby! - My son... - Father! Brother... I had stolen 5000 bucks from Thakur's house. - Not Mister Shyam. - I stole the necklace. May your tribe increase. I sold the stolen necklace to Shyam. I accept my crime. I flicked the necklace when Shyam came to return it to inspector. - Lock them all up! - Come on. Go! Silly girl! Why do you cry? Why must you cry? We'll get married soon as I'm free. We'll have our own world. A world with our own house. And our children. Little ones... Dark ones, fair ones. Some like you, some like me... - What? - Yes. - Make me a promise. - What? You won't make the kids like yourself Never. Happy?
