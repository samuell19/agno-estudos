Yoo Hoo! - Martina? - Yeah. Are you sure we are going the right way? Yes of course. Excuse me? Is this the right way to Baker? Yeah! Actually can you give us a ride? Our car broke down.

So, where are you two going? More like, where are you going? [police radio] [flies buzzing] Sir, Mr Zack is waiting for you, in the theater. [show band music] Okay! That's it. Cut! Thank you ladies! Don't worry about it. My father said you were the best. Well, he was a wise man! What do you know about me? I heard you managed to mismanage your father's clubs. [shouting] Shut up! Word is, you're a spoilt, rich little asshole. That is 'til you totaled your Maserati. Now you're an angry, rich little asshole. Man, I was starting to like you. Have I left anything out? What's that? Morphine! Ulcers? I wish. Jules! I need you to find me a person. A girl. Her real name is Sharon Jackson, but she likes to call herself Cherie. She thinks it sounds classy. Her parents were dirt farmers. I made her a star! I gave her everything. Everything white trash like her could dream of. I'll pay you a hundred grand. I don't want her hurt. She means that much to you? She's different than the other girls. It's hard to explain. So, why's this beauty flown away? I don't know. She'll see she needs me! She's just a little girl. Helpless. Room 233. Thank you. [solemn music] So, what do you guys do? - Um, we work in movies. - Are you actors? Well almost, we're stuntmen. Yeah, we do all the dangerous stuff. You know like the shoot outs, the explosives, the robberies. - Wow! - You name it we do it, honey. That's where we are going tomorrow. Let's find a motel, and get an early night. So, where are you going? You must be going somewhere. Yeah, we're going somewhere. As long as there's good liquor, nice women with nice tits, like you.

Close the door on your way out. Where? Where do people go when they escape from Vegas? L.A. Home of the homeless. Impossible! Like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I gotta figure if she spent most of last night worrying, 'cos she got sleepy just outside the city limits. I've no cars available. I see! Would another two thou help? Maybe three thousand? Alright.

It looks just like snow! [ethereal music] I'll stay here. I... I can't, I'm shy with you listening. Okay... I'll go a little further. I should be used to it. When we were little, my brother and I, used to go behind the pine trees near the beach. How did you get mixed up with Shaun? Oh, he's not such a bad guy. Yeah... right! I met him a couple of years ago. I... I kinda got into some trouble, you know. Stole a car with a coupla guys, and... we had drugs on us and... I was the one driving the car, so they threw the book at me. And you met Shaun in prison? Yup. If it weren't for him, you know, I wouldn't have made it through. [car approaching] Did the Eyetai call? No, but it's cool. He'll call. If that little sod runs off with our money, I'm going to kill his sister. Well, she's not gonna talk. She's not going to talk? Whatever happens man, she's dead. She knows too much. [panting] You untied her? [sinister music] You stupid burk! Why did you untie her? What's happening to you man? I'm sorry... I fucked up. It won't happen no more.

Are you planning on staying long? If you want me? Okay! Let's take it one day at a time, okay? I'm not read much anymore. I don't have a fucking agent... No one's reading my scripts unless they're submitted by a fucking agent. Guess what's in the green bag? A million dollars? The answer all my dreams? Well, you're not far wrong, for the first time in your life! [chuckling] We're rich Mickey! - Rich! - Jesus! Now we can settle down, like any Hollywood writer and his wife.

I swear things are gonna be different. I'm sorry Martina... For everything. What is it? Oh! My father gave it to me. It's the only thing I ever really got from him, you know? You know you're pretty tough. Also my brothers say so... Because... when my mother died, I couldn't cry. At her funeral... Everyone was sobbing... even people, who didn't know her that well. But I couldn't cry. Because Martina... is always the tough one! Martina can take it. Martina... doesn't need... anybody. [wistful piano music] It's okay.

Ever since we killed that Ranger. It's always been over for us. [wind whistling] [car hooting] Now, I'm worried about the key. - Could anyone use it? - No! Not without your signature and your ID. And your key has to be used with the bank's key to open the box. We guarantee you, the utmost privacy. [grunting] It's my first day on the job, and I'm going to take care of it.

My bank. Ahh! Ahh! [groaning] You want it? You got it! Ow! How did you find me? Never mind that, where's the money? I put it somewhere safe. That money... wasn't mine, It belongs to a couple of criminals who have my sister. You said your sister was in Los Angeles. I made that up! I didn't know you! I didn't know how much I could tell you... And as it turns out, I was right not to trust you! What really happened? It's a long story. All that matters now, is that if they don't get the money they're going kill her! - Good bye! - I have to go with you! Huh! Did you think I was going to hit you? You need the key and my signature. I have to go with you Luca. Let's go! Hurry! Wait! Who was that? [banging] [yelling] Run! Oh! Hey, watch it! - Oh, oh! - Sorry! Shit! Come on Luca! Miss, Miss! Could you open the door please?
