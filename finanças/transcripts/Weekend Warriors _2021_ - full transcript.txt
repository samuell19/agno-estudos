Speak Josie, speak. Smooth move, klutz. Loser! All right, class, settle down. Mickey. Come up here and solve this problem on the board for me. I'll see you after class. Ooooh! Hey, hey, that's enough of that. Go to the board and solve the problem. Hey, word on the street is Mickey is gonna bust you up like he did that 10th grader last week. Whew, that was not pretty. Thanks. You're not helping. Maybe I can make it to the car before he gets me. Yeah, maybe. Dead man walking. Where do you think you're going, geek? Let's see if the little wussy scout can knock me down now. Look, I didn't mean to trip you, it was an accident. Accident huh? I think it's time for you to have an accident. Fight, fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight! Didn't they teach you self-defense in Boy Scouts? Looks like the only thing you know how to do is bleed! - Hey, hey, are you okay? - Yeah. Here. You're bleeding. - Thank you. - Yeah. Now we're both gonna be in trouble. What are they gonna do? Suspend me? Lets see, that means I get to stay home, sleep late, uh, and swim in the pool all day. Why did you help me? Because your nose was taking a pounding and I sort of like your nose. What happened to you? I don't wanna talk about it. It looks like somebody got into a fight. My Sunday school teacher says you should always turn the other cheek and you should never fight. - Yeah, thanks. I'll remember that. Are you okay? Hey. Oh. If you don't wanna tell me about it, that's okay, okay? You tell me when you're ready. Are you asleep? No. I can't. Do you wanna tell me what's wrong? Well, to start off, everyone at school makes fun of me, I got no friends, nobody likes me, and the saddest part is, I don't even know if I like myself. Sweetheart, you are a loving, caring, wonderful boy. Why would you say such a thing? I don't know mom, maybe it's this place. Well what do you mean? Remember when Dad took us up to the mountains and Grandma and Grandpa's? Yeah. That was one of the best weekends of my life. I just think spending some time away from this place would be good for all of us. And plus, I miss Uncle Joey. Yeah, well Uncle Joey has his own life now and I can't miss any work. Well, he said he'd come and get us whenever we wanted. I just don't know. Please, mom. You really want this, don't you? Not only do I want this, I need it. Okay. Let me think about it and we'll talk in the morning. I love you. I love you too, Mom. Okay. Oh excuse me. I'll be right back. Hello? Hey, Joey? It's Peggy. Sis, hey. How are you and the kids doing? Good. Um, sorry to call so late. Are you already in bed? Uh, not yet. Are Mom and Dad there? Mom and Dad, they went out of town for the weekend to go see Aunt Judy up in the hospital. They'll be back tomorrow, though. Do you want me to tell them to call you? No, I just need to ask them a question. Is there anything I can help you with? I think the kids wanna come out for the weekend. Cool. I just don't wanna interrupt anything. I wanted to make sure it was okay. Sis, you're never interrupting anything. You guys know you are welcomed here, okay? So when are you coming? Oh, that's just it. I have to work, so I was hoping that maybe you and Dad could pick up the kids for the weekend? I will come up and personally pick the kids up tomorrow morning. Really? Are you sure it's no trouble? Of course. Who's their favorite uncle? You are. All right, then I'll be there to see you. Tomorrow morning. Joey, the kids are gonna be so happy. Thank you. Bye. Get up! Get up! No, go away! You better wake up or you're gonna miss your trip to the mountains. What? You're not joking, are you? Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes! But you need to hurry up because your Uncle Joey is on his way, so you need to start packing. Yes! Let's go. Oh, boy, are you ready? Yup. Oh my god. Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Woo, wow, you should grow more. Yeah. Good to see you. Hi, sis. Thank you for coming to get them. Oh you're so welcome. We're gonna have a great weekend, aren't we? - Hi. - Give me a hug. They need a good weekend away. Well, they're gonna have it. Here let's hug it out, buddy. All right, now give me your stuff. Let's get loaded up. Okay. - I call shotgun. - Call me when you get there. Yeah, yeah, I know. Take good care of your sister. Yes, I know. Okay. - Oh you need help? - Yep. I got you. - Can you hop in? - Okay, watch your phone. Okay. Okay. You take care of my babies. I sure will. - Buckle up. - All right, kids buckle up. - Buckle up. - Put you seatbelt on. I know, Mom. Be good, now. Bye. So how's school? I like school. What about you, Scottie? He doesn't like school because he doesn't have any friends. What? I have friends. Who? Victor and Tommy Adkins. Victor is a huge nerd and Tommy Adkins? Yuck, he's the smelliest boy in school. He smells like pickles. I'm not kidding. Kids in school picking on you? The only time they talk to me is to pick on me. What do you do about that? I don't do anything. Well, you have to stand up for yourself. What do you mean? Like fight? If you have to. What do you do for fun when you're not in school? He doesn't do anything. He just sits in his room all day and picks his nose. Is that true? Yeah. You know, tomorrow's not promised buddy. You gotta have fun, you gotta get out there and live a little bit. Uncle Joey, can I ask you a question? Sure. Aren't you a little old to be living at home with your parents? Oh well you know, I tried that whole move out of the house and get a job thing and it really stunk. So whatever you do, don't do that and always stay at home. Never leave home. I ain't gonna lie, I thought about it. Just the other day, I was on my bike and I thought to myself I could pedal across the United States if I wanted to. You know, just go. Hit the open road. I can see me now, the wind blowing in my hair. It would be a wild trip. I don't know kid, that sounds a little dangerous. Uncle Joey, I'm dangerous. Hey, I've got a question for you guys. Do you wanna go camping this weekend? Yeah! A group of friends and I we go camping a lot and we play war games. What's war games? War games is like, it's all about strategy and survival, you know? We pick a spot way out in the middle of nowhere and we put this yellow flag and the first person or team to get to that yellow flag wins. Okay, it sounds easy. Yeah, but the hard part is getting to that flag without getting shot or killed. Killed? Well, we don't really get killed. We do it with paint ball guns. You know, they look like real guns but it's just paint. So no one gets hurt? Well I mean, it hurts if you get hit but it only stings for a minute. And it's so much fun. What do you say? I'm in. Me, too. All right, great. Hey you know what, though? I need you to do something for me. What? Hey, Scottie. Get out of the car and come talk man-to-man with me for a second. Hey listen, I need you to call your mom for me, all right? I need you to tell her we're at Grandma and Grandpa's house and if she asks to talk to them, you gotta tell her that they're in town doing some stuff, okay? Why? Why do I have to do this? It's the only way. Why... Why do I have to lie? Because your mom will kill me if I take you away to the woods for the weekend, man. Come on, hey, in the Boy Scouts there's a code of honor, right? So my friends and I have a code of honor, too. I'm not really supposed to tell anybody what we do on the weekends. But, from the sounds of it, you could use some adventure more than anyone I've ever seen in my life, man. Come on, you're 14-years-old, you're a man now. It's time to use some of those Boy Scout skills. And what better place do do it than out in the woods where survival is everything? So what do you say? Are we gonna do this? I don't know. Look, I'll make this easy on you. The road to the left there, that goes to Grandma and Grandpa's house. The road to the right, it goes way up in to the mountains where eventually the war games will start. So you just point the way. All right, call your mom. Let me talk to her. Hello? Hey, sis. - Joey? - Yeah, yeah. Hey, I wanted to just call you and let you know everything's doing great. Are you already there? Yeah, yeah. I mean, there wasn't a lot of traffic so we made good time. How are the kids? Oh, they're doing great, they're doing great. Hey listen, Scottie wants to talk to you for a sec. Hi, Mom. Hi sweetheart, how are you and your sister doing? Yeah, we're fine, we're fine. Okay good. Now listen, if your grandparents need help around the house, you give them a hand, okay? And don't forget to brush your teeth and wash up before you eat. Yeah, yeah, Mom, I got it. - I love you. - Yeah, I gotta go. Wait, let me talk to your grandparents. They're not here right now. They went to the store to get some things. Okay, well, let me talk to Uncle Joey. Hey. Are you sure it's no trouble? Oh, come on, it's no problem at all. We're gonna have the greatest weekend ever. Okay. Bye. Good job. Hey Chief. Yeah. I mean, would it kill him to smile and say hello? Well, hey, he's had it a little rough. How about cutting him a little slack, buddy? We could get the boys and some beer? Boys, beer. Yes. We're about to go. Let's go somewhere soon. Wanna go fishing in- - Ladies. You know you can't park here. We're gonna move sooner or later. Well then do it. Don't get your panties in a wad, chief. I heard that. All right kids. These two guys right here, these are the McKinley brothers. This is Mike and Travis. Howdy. Hey. This big guy over here, that's Kimble. Call me Bull. Bull here used to be a professional football player. From what I hear, he was the hardest hittin' linebacker in the business. And that ain't no bull. This is Edward here. Good to make your acquaintance. And this right here is Lisa. Hi, good to meet you. Hello, aren't you just adorable? Right back at ya. Lisa! Get over here. You guys, uh, wait right here. What's with the crossbow? Gotta eat, don't ya? Don't look at me like that. Are you kidding me? Look, I know we've got rules, man. No, no, no. You look, okay. You know how important these war games are to us. All of us. I need this. Okay? Yeah, I know. Look, they won't get in the way. You won't even know that they're here. Yeah, I better not. For your sake. You got my word. Woo! Let's get this party started. Give me your bag. Hey, excuse me, stewardess. I'll be carrying my suitcase on board with me. We don't have room for you and your beer. That's fine. I'll just ride with the kids and Joey. Officer Shoreman, come in. Go for Shoreman. What's your 20? Hi Betsy. I'm out here on Mount Holly Road looking for trouble. Well, speaking of trouble, Chief Baumgardner is lookin' for you. Now is he? How about telling him I'm a little bit indisposed at the moment? I'll tell him but he ain't gonna like it. Now, now Betsy, you know he has a lot of trouble with his feelings and he's nothing at all like me. Well you could say that again. You've been showing your feelings to every woman in town. - What can I say? Women love the uniform. What's up? Get him. Get him! Don't you think it's time for you to retire? Retire? They're gonna have to pry my radar gun out of my cold, dead hands before that happens. I have way too much fun with this job. Speaking of fun, I gotta go, Betsy. I got one flyin'. Driver, pull over to the side of the road. Uh oh, no, no, no. No, you gotta be kiddin' me. Not right now. - Oh no. - Come on, man. You need to pull over now. I ain't goin' back to prison for nobody. - That's right. - That's right. What are you talking about? I ain't goin' back to prison for nobody. That violates my parol, don't you think? And besides, nothing good came out of prison except meetin' you guys, man. Hey, whatever you do, brother, I'm with you. Don't even worry about it. - You need to pull over! - Would you shut up? Just shut up! And relax. Everybody be cool, be cool. He dropped off, he dropped, he dropped off. We're good, we're good. We're good. - All right. - Let's roll, man. Sweetheart, you know I love you, right? Huh? Get over here. But don't you ever tell me what to do again, you understand me? I run this ship! I run it! Dispatch, come in. Go for dispatch. Oh, hi Betsy. Hey, can you get George to meet me out here on the far end of Mount Holly Road? Donnie, don't tell me you ran out of gas again. Yep. What happened to the blue lights back there? Nothing to worry about. Call it divine intervention. Nobody's gonna mess up our weekend! Huh? All right, here we go. Where's my girl? - I know you miss me. - All right, all right. There's my sweetheart. Huh? Cool. Look at her. All right, Mike. Yep? - Bull. - Got 'em, coach. Joey. Sebastian. Edward. - I got no service. - Me, either. Oh, no you guys won't get any reception out here. Well it's a good thing I downloaded most of my music, so I'm good. Hey Scottie, you ride with Sebastian. Jamie, you're with me. Hold on tight. It's gonna be a wild ride. You're gonna treat us real good right there. Yeah. We're gonna be ridin' or we're gonna be dyin'. All right. Get up here all snug. She may not be the fastest, but she's the safest. Yeah! ♪ Can't back out ♪ 'Cause I'm two feet in ♪ Eye on the ground ♪ Water risin' higher ♪ Not a root to bring ♪ Ain't goin' under ♪ Now you can't take me ♪ I am the warrior ♪ You are the warrior ♪ We are the warriors ♪ And we're about to win All right, listen up! Listen up! Shut up, everybody shut up. Gather around, all right? This is how it works: the goal is to capture the yellow flag as always. But this time it's gonna be a lot harder. Whoa, what do you mean harder? Are you trying to make it harder because you're tired of me winning or are you just tired of losing? Oh, brother, you sound overconfident, beast. - What's up? - No, no, no. I just didn't come all the way out here to Redneckville to lose. Losin' ain't in my playbook. No you came out here for the same reason all of us came out here for. Yeah, and what's that? We like to hunt. So that just means we love to kill and there's no greater thrill than hunting humans. Of course we can't actually kill people, but if you take a hit from one of these paint guns, you're gonna wish you were dead. I've seen paintball wars on TV. Doesn't look like it hurts that bad. Yeah, well, a normal paintball kit might feel like a bad bee sting, but these bad boys right here? You get tagged with one of these and it's gonna feel like you were hit with a sledgehammer. Four years of college didn't teach me much, but what it did teach me was to apply what I have learned to what interests me. I like to inflict pain. So I decided to take one of these little CO2 cartridges and increase its power by just a bit. I mean, to truly appreciate it, you gotta see it. Hey Travis, start running. - What? - I said start running. Yeah. Go get 'em, right? Go get 'em, yeah. - Come on, man. - Yeah. - Come on. - That's what's up! Will you stand down? Stand down. Come on! Come on, hot shot, let's go! Come on! Come on, big boy! Come on! Let's see, you purty, but can you get a purty shot? Let's give it to me! Hit me! Hey, Travis? Come on, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. How'd that feel? Um, it felt like I got my butt kicked. That was awesome. All right, all right, is he all right? Good, good, good. All right, back to what's gonna happen tomorrow. To capture the yellow flag, not only do we have to eliminate each other but there's another team: a 10 man team made up of some of the best from around the world, and they've already set up their camp around the perimeter. They'll be wearing red armbands. They are professionals. They've never lost. But they haven't faced us. After we eliminate the Red Team, then you're on your own. I wouldn't have it any other way. That's what's up, baby. All right. All right, let's go set up camp. We'll go check out the rest of the terrain. Magazine is good, but they are no good. Worthy adversary... Who's that? That? That's Sominski. He's their best. Look. It is Weekend Warriors. Pow. Hey, Uncle Joey? Yeah? Yeah, I don't think Wesley likes us very much. Likes us? He hates us. Well, Wesley lost his whole family when he was real young. He's been on his own ever since. You know, but don't mistake that tough exterior. His IQ's off the charts, just like his temper. He doesn't have a family? These guys are his family now. All right, come on, let's get this. Them? Hey, give me that hatchet, numb nuts. All right. Hatchet up something, huh, tough boy? Well, I mean, what about Sebastian? Well, Sebastian and I, we're the new guys here. We don't really quite fit in yet, but, you know, it's not really about fitting in. It's about winning. Let's get in here. I'm gonna take care of right now, brother. - Let's see. - Come on, buddy. Come on! What's wrong with them? That's the McKinley Brothers. They're about as country as it gets. Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go! But you've never seen brothers closer than these guys. And they're both crazy. Act like 10-year-olds, but you know, if I was gonna go to war, I'd take them with me every time. Them? Travis is real good with blending into the woods there. Usually by the time you see him, it's too late. And Mike? They call him the sniper. He's the best shot in the state. And Edward back over there, he's a real smart guy, but I think he lacks what it takes to be a leader, you know, he looks up to Wesley. Think that's why he follows him around like a puppy. And Bull there, after the NFL, got himself into some trouble and ended up in prison but that's where he met Wesley and the brothers there. Here we are. So, we're uh, we're pretty deep in the forest, right? - Yeah. - Are they any, like, - wild animals around here? - Yeah. Some wolves and coyotes and mountain lions. And I've heard that there's occasionally a grizzly bear. Grizzly bear? Yeah, but it's highly unlikely we're gonna come across one. Okay but like, what happens if we do? Well, they're most likely more scared of us than we are of them. Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it. Well, if we were to see a grizzly bear and if one were to try to attack, then what you do is you pretend to be dead, because then they get disinterested and they leave you alone. See Scottie, even the bear would be bored of you. Okay, hey, hey. We're good. She and I can take care of the rest of this. You know how to use one of these right here to start a fire? Oh yeah. All right. You're in charge of the fire. You keep that on you. All right, you got all your hooks latched? - Yep. - Yeah? You got everything in there? All right, yep, undo that and we'll zip it up. Damn, that's some strong 'shine. Yeah. That's my grandpappy's recipe. Moonshine. Run in our blood. Yeah. Here's a gift for you, princess. Bottom's up. Go on. You all right, Edward? Uh, that tastes like, um, uh, Fireball candy. Speaking of candy, I got some. Anybody want some candy? I'll take some. Hey Wesley? Do you remember that time we was in the yard and Big Ray come after me? I was there. Yeah, what happened? Well... Wesley cut off on Big Ray before he could get to my brother and he put a beat on him like I've never seen a man get beat. I thought he was dead. He lived. But he never bothered me or any of us again. That's just what one time Wesley saved us. I think I can speak for all of us when I say we'd do anything for that man right there. Yeah, I will drink to that. Nice, Uncle Joey. Those are some great role models for us. They've all paid their debt to society. Everybody makes mistakes, all right? It's time. Kids, I think it is time to get everything into the tent and go to sleep. - Why? What's happening. Don't worry about it. It's just a part of the initiation for us, uh, so just, I think it's time to go to bed. Let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Come on, get up. Oh guys, come on. Come on now, not tonight. I'm too tired. Guys, come on. No. Let's just go to bed. Mike, come on. Bring it on, come on. Set him down. This brand is a symbol of our brotherhood. Are you willing to sacrifice your burning flesh to become part of our family? Wesley. Let me go. Let me go. Let him go. All right. That's it. Let's just get it over with. That's what I'm talkin' about. That's what I'm talkin' about. Give me a sip. All right. May we be heroes in this life and great warriors in death. - All right, just do it. - Do it! - Come on. - Do it! Come on. - Do it. - Do it! Yeah, get him, get him. - You'll never be alone. - That's it. We're your family now, you understand? That's right. That's right. Yeah! Look at me. Now you're a man, do you understand me? You're one of us! That's it, that's it. Have some of that. That's real 'shine right there. I gotta go pee. Yeah? Okay. I'ma turn in. Okay. You know I love you, right? I love you too, Wesley. Lisa. What happened to you? What are you talking about? There are marks all over your back and I know they're not from me. Who did this? - Are you cheating on me? - No. - Hey. - Who did this to you? I, I was walking back from the woods. Who's there? And, and then he just came out of nowhere. What? I asked him to stop, but he was so strong. What are you talking about? I did everything I could. Who did this to you? Joey. All right, so... Here's your map. - I know you're gonna win. - Yeah? All right? I'm rootin' for you. Where's Joey at? Um... Well Joey, Sebastian, and the kids, I think they left about a half an hour ago? Yeah? Everything cool? So the Red Team's perimeter is here, and we are here. The yellow flag is just over the ridge here. Okay. All right. Okay, great, okay. You kids, go wait on that ridge right over there. You should be able to see all the action from there, all right? Cool. All right. Hey. Can I borrow that? Okay, but, promise you won't break it? I promise. I got a great collection of music, some I even think you'll like. Sweet. Hey Sebastian? Good luck. You're the one that's gonna need it. - Look, it's the flag. - It means I won. No it doesn't. All right, top of the hill's up here. All right. I see you. Hello, Edward. I'll see you soon. I see you, Blue! I see you! So your team's undefeated, huh? Not anymore. Hey. Says in the Paintball Wars handbook, no physical contact with the opponent. Oh does it now? Yeah. Chapter two, page eight. Chapter two, page eight? Hm. I must've skipped that page. Do we have anyone left out on the field at all? Only one, sir. Sominski. Sominski. He's the best. They won't ever catch him. I just say get him on the radio. Sominski, this is team leader, copy. Sominski. This is team leader. Do you copy? Sominiski, this is team leader, do you copy? Red Team leader, this is Sominski. Over. Has your position been compromised at all? Negative Red Team leader. I have target in sight. Watch out for those rednecks. They're bloody good. Don't worry. They never find me. Hello. Hello? Who is this? Yeah, this is the rednecks. I just wanted to call and inform you that we have captured your last soldier. Thank you for playin'. Oh. You can go home now. Wow, look. Oh-ho, cool. Uncle Joey told me about this. What does it mean? It means that they've beaten the Red Team now and they're on their own to fight each other. We should be able to see everything from here. Cool. It's you and me. We're the last two left. Woo. - Yes! - Yeah. Yes! You're so dead. No, you're dead. What happened? Justice. What are you talkin' about? He forced himself on Lisa, man. He got what he deserved. He's dead. I didn't like him anyway. Hm. So what do we do now? We can say it was an accident. An accident? No. I'll be back in jail so fast it'll make your head swim and I'm definitely not going back there. Then what? Nobody knows we're out here but us, so we'll just bury the body where nobody can find it. What about those two brats? Oh, we'll have to get rid of them, too. What? You've gotta think this through. This is not a good idea. I ain't killin' no innocent kids. No way. Where's your loyalty, man? With you. I mean with us. Right answer. Yeah, yeah, let's go. Come on, come on. Come on, let's go. Come on. They've seen everything. Get 'em! Which way? Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Get 'em! You hear that? They're close, we have to hide, we have to hide. Let's go, come on. Come on. I got you now. You all right? - Yeah. - You okay? All right, come on, we gotta go. Hey Mike! Yeah? Did you get 'em? You better get over here, brother. No, no. No. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. No, brother, wake up. Wake up, buddy. Innocent kids, huh? I'm gonna kill those kids. Wake up, brother. Wake up. He's not dead. No, no. Travis! Travis! We need to get warm. I'm gonna grab some fire wood. Okay, hurry. Please. ♪ Happy birthday to you Go on, make a wish. Yay. All right. A survival knife? Yeah, I had one when I was a kid. Not only is it super cool, it's incredibly handy. Thanks, Dad. You're welcome. All right already, now let's have some cake. This is for you, brother. I love you, brother. You know what we need to do. We pledge vengeance. I'm gonna kill those murderin' kids for my brother. That's right. Prepare yourselves tonight. We leave at sun up. Wesley. Do you honestly think we're gonna be able to find them? I mean, there's like a million places they can hide. Yeah, we'll find 'em. We might not find 'em alive. With these temperatures and the wildlife, they'll be lucky to make it through the night. Hey. What about Joey's body? Edward, get over here. Get over here! What's up? You and Edward go bury the body where nobody can find it. Let's go. You need to sleep. I can't. I'm scared. I am, too. We're gonna be okay. Here. Pray with me. We need all the help we can get. Dear Lord, please help Jamie and I to make it home safe. And please help our mom. She's probably worried to death by now. I know Uncle Joey is up there with you and Dad now. And tell him we don't blame him for what happened, and that we miss him. Although we're scared, our dad taught us in times of darkness that we recite the Lord's Prayer. Thanks, Dad. So here it goes. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... And forgive us our tres... Hey this is Joey. You know what to do. Hey, Joey, it's Peggy. Um, you're going straight to voicemail and Mom and Dad aren't picking up. Can you give me a call, please? Just getting a little worried. Thank you. What do we do now? Well, the best thing to do is keep as much space between us and Wesley as possible. Where'd you get that? Oh, I got it from Uncle Joey's tent. Good thing I did. There should be a highway right over the hill. Let's go. They're close. All right, let's go. Come on. So, according to the map, the road should be right down here. What highway? I don't see a highway. God! This highway looks like it hasn't been used in forever. It was on the map. Maybe we'll just wait and then we can get lucky. Or we can just stay here and die of old age. All right, okay? I just gotta think of something else. All right, uh... What if we just follow the road. And then we have to run into somebody. Yeah, they call themselves the Weekend Warriors. That's a bad idea. That's the first place they'll look for us. Well, I mean, you are right. The best thing we can do is to stay together and get off the road. Let's go. Hey yo Wesley! What's up? Looks like they gone into the river. They're trying to cover their tracks. Ain't no tellin' when they'll come out. - All right, look here. We need to split up. Sebastian, you go straight and you keep to the right and don't let 'em get by you. Bull, you take the terrain up there. It's not that rough. The water's gonna push 'em back. It's gonna help us catch 'em. I'm on it! Me and Mike are gonna take the river, and you and Lisa, you cross the creek and you stay to the left, and do not let them get by you. Let's go. You know we can't do this, right? Yeah, I know, just... Look, we have to play along or we're all dead. Sooner or later we're gonna catch up to those kids, and then what? I don't know, I don't know. I'll think of somethin'. Follow me, they're coming. Look. There they are. Wait, guys. Wait. We won't hurt you. Shoot 'em. Hey, hey kid, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, no. Come on. Come with us. This? Don't worry about this. That's nothing, all right? Come on. Just come with us and you'll be safe, I promise. Come on. Hey Scottie! Say your prayers! You gave me no choice. No, no! Come on, hey, come on. We can make it, come on! Come on. They shot me. No, come on, we can make it. Run. Run! Look what you made me do! Get 'em. Hey, Chief? You have three messages. Copper Bell? Did they get my special 'shine in? No. Oh. Oh, no, don't tell me, Mrs. Hollaway? What's she want now? She said that some kids snuck in and stole some apples. It was like a bushel of apples from her orchard. What do you want me to tell her? I don't know, Joyce. Tell her, tell her I don't have time to be chasin' apple bandits. I don't know. Make up somethin'. - Okay. - No, no. Joyce, she's just gonna call back again, isn't she? - Yeah. - Oh, okay, tell her... Tell her I'll be out there tomorrow morning. I'm sure she will love to hear that. And Joyce, have you seen those Montgomery files anywhere? What? Oh boy. Should probably slow down on the 'shine, buddy. Copy that. Mm-hm. - Hey, can I help you? - I need some help. I need to speak with a police officer. Oh, over here at the window. - They can help you. - Thank you. Excuse me? Excuse me, I need some help. Okay, give me a minute. Are you okay? Give you a minute? My kids are missing. Hey, can you come over here and help her right now? Okay, uh, what's this about? I just said my kids are missing. I'm sorry, excuse me, what's going on here? My two kids. I don't know where they are. I went by my parents' house, there was nobody there, I went by the neighbor's house. They said the house has been vacant for days. Chief, you want me to take - the report on this one? - No, I got it. What are their names? Scottie and Jamie Kendall. What are their ages? Can you tell me what they were wearing? Scottie is 14 and Jamie's 10. Um... I think Scottie was wearing green cargo pants and uh, uh, a blue shirt and a gray hoodie and he had his black baseball cap on. Um, Jamie was wearing black pants and a purple sweater. All right, got it. Just calm down now. Now when was the last time you saw 'em? It's been two days since Joey picked 'em up. Who's Joey? He's my brother. All right. So Joey picked 'em up. Can you describe the vehicle he was driving? He's um, he's driving a white Jeep with big tires. A white Jeep with big tires? What's your name? Peggy Kendall. I'm their mom. All right, well, Peggy Kendall, come on. - Let's figure this out. - Thank you. Excuse me, ma'am, would you describe that car again, please? Wow, look at it. Nice. Come on. Ha, looks like your room. Very funny. All right, let's look around for stuff we can use. Oh-oh, sweet, lima beans and corn. You know, I never thought I'd be this excited about lima beans and corn. Oh sleeping bag, I love you. What? What is it? It's in my leg. What is? - Rat! - Oh! - Get it off, get it off! - What, what? What do you want me to do? Just kill it! - I don't wanna kill it! - Get it off! That's just a field mouse. Oh. Yeah, but that was gross. Are you okay? Besides the fact that we're being chased by murderers and a rodent just tried to use my pants as its new home? I'm fine. So you're okay? Eh. I'll take that as a yes. All right, I'll keep looking for stuff. Whoa. I can take that. You bets-ta. Let's go back to the campsite. I promise I'll make it worth it. No, we're gonna rest here tonight and then we're gonna go back out. It's gonna get really cold tonight and they're gonna have to build a fire if they wanna stay alive. We find the fire, we find the kids. I'm so tired and starving. Can we stop and eat and get some rest? Yeah. Here. The lid's sharp. Do you think anyone will find us? Are you kidding me? You know mom is worried to death by now. She probably has everybody in the state looking for us. Yeah, but, no one knows we're here but us. She thinks we're at Grandma and Grandpa's. We'll be fine. I'm so tired. Why don't you get some rest while I go out and get some firewood for tonight? Dad would've been proud of you. Thanks. Jaime? Jaime! Leave her alone! Scottie? Scottie. Scottie. If we were to see a grizzly bear and if one were to try to attack, then what you do is you pretend to be dead, 'cause then they get disinterested and they leave you alone. Jaime, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie. - Oh. - Scottie! I thought you were dead. Eh, it's just a mean old grizzly bear. Nothing I couldn't handle. Your arm. Yeah. He got me. He got me pretty good. Here. Lay down. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe just for a minute. I'm gonna close my eyes. Scottie? Scottie? What the? Did you do all this? I cleaned you up. You had blood all over you. And let me tell you, red is not your color. Believe it or not, I was also paying attention when Dad was showing you first aid. And I watch tons of survival shows. I know what you're thinking, how can I be so beautiful and smart, too? I don't know. I just am. It's crazy, right? What's up with the taking my shoes? I'll explain later. Look. The deeper we go into the woods, the less likely we make it out of here alive. Okay, so what do you suggest? We have to make it here. Okay, to make it there we have to go by their camp site. And when we get there we have at least 10 miles to the road. I know that. So how are we gonna do that? We'll backtrack. We'll walk along the bank of the stream until we pass them. Okay. Uh, let's suppose that works, and we make it back to their camp. We still have at least 10 miles until the road. Once we get to camp it should be empty except for the tents and four wheelers. How did you come up with all this? I may be a kid, but I am not stupid. Let's go. Let's go, come on. So, what happens when they find where we camped last night? You know they're gonna track us here. They always do. Big brother, as always, you underestimate me. ♪ And your arm bone - Yo. - What's up? They played us. What are you talking about? We've been here already, man. We're going in circles. Wesley, seriously man, we can just let them go. Anybody here wanna back out, let him or her say right now. They deserve what's comin' to 'em for killin' my brother. See, he wasn't just your brother. We're all brothers and sisters here. That's what this means. And if you're not a part of this family... Hey. Then you're a traitor. - Listen, Bull. - Mm-mm. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Now we can take care of that right now. Mm-hm. Bull, Bull? Hey? You guys are right. Um, I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinkin'. Just, I'm on board with you guys, just relax, okay? Relax. We'll find 'em. I'm on board. You're right. They're goin' for the four-wheelers. How do you know that? Because it's their only chance. We need to find some keys. Go in Wesley's tent. Thank you, Uncle Joey. I got the keys, let's go. Give me the keys. I can't let you do it. I can't let you kill those kids. Give me the keys! No! Come on, go faster! Come on! You're dead. Jaime! Just breathe. Come on, breathe. Breathe, just breathe. Come on. Come on, stay with me, breathe. Come on. Come on. Breathe. Breathe. Come on. Bull, you good? I'm good, man. Go get them kids, man! Let's go, let's go! Ah! We're outta gas. Do you see them? No. I think we lost 'em. Come on, we gotta keep goin'. Come on, come on. All right, we gotta go. Come on. Anything? No, nothing yet. Come on, come on. Come here, come here. We gotta go, right here. Okay, let's go. Stop. I need to rest. Hey, hey, hey, it's all right. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. It's gonna be all right. All right? All right, I'm gonna try to take it out, all right? Please make the pain go away. All right, on three. One... Two... Three. I can't get it out. Come on, we gotta keep going. Okay, let's go. Come on. Let's go, come on, come on. Which way? I think they either went over or around. I'm gonna go up, you go around. Move it! Let's go! I got you now. Nowhere to go but up. Bring your arm here up, come on. - You all right? - Yeah. - I'm okay. - Come on. We can camp here for the night. That'll give you enough time to regain strength, all right? No, you have to go without me. No. Mm-mm, I'm not leaving you. It's not an option. All right. I'm gonna go get some firewood. Hey. You're all right. Okay? I got you, I got you! I got you. I got you! Help, Scottie, help. Yeah, Scottie, help. Help, Scottie. Come out! Come out, come out, wherever you are! I know you can hear me. Are you listening? This sweet little, young, little innocent girl. Yeah, Scottie. She has her whole life ahead of her. What are you gonna do? Don't do it, Scottie. Run. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, Scottie. I'll spare her life for yours. If you're not out on here on the count of three, well let's just say sweet little Jaime is gonna be joining Joey! It's your choice! One... Two... Don't do it, Scottie! Run! Three! Wait! No one else has to die. Oh, you're wrong about that. Drop the gun. I'll finish her right here. You know I'll do it. I got nothin' to lose, man. Don't do it, Scottie. Run. Time is up. Okay, all right. What do you want me to do? Toss me the gun. Go over there to your brother. I'm sorry it's gotta end like this. Just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Joey never even touched me. I was with Edward. I love him, and now you're never gonna hurt anyone ever again. It's okay. Hey! Hey! Air base to one, this is Chief Baumgardner. I think we found them. We're preparing to land. Oh my god. May have some injuries. Have a couple of ambulances on stand by. Roger, out. On the ground! On the ground! Do not move. Mom! Are you okay? - I'm all right. - You hurt? What happened to your arm? Don't worry. Jaime took care of me. Besides, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Oh, Jaime. All right, very careful now. Step down, that's it, good girl. Oh. Jaime. Oh, baby. Mom. Are you okay? Oh, god. Is she gonna be okay? - Oh. - She's a tough one. Baby. Hey. Hey Chief. Hey Scottie, how are you doing? I'm good. Everything's finally getting back to normal. Oh that's good news. Good, good. Well what do we owe the pleasure? Oh, I just happened to be in your fine city and I thought I'd stop by, check in, see how things are goin'. How's Jaime? Well she's getting on my last nerve, but I wouldn't have it any other way? Good. Well, yeah... I just wanted to say spending time with you and your sister over the last couple of weeks has been really good for me. I uh... In you kids I see my grandkids and I lost them a couple of years ago. They're in heaven now, and uh, I miss 'em. So I was thinking that, you know, if it's all right with all of you, maybe I could every now and then stop by, check in, see how you're doin'? Scottie? Yeah. That'd be cool. I'd like that. Me, too. Me three. Besides, you saved my kids. Oh, I didn't save 'em. They saved themselves. Well, you brought them home to me, and for that, I'm forever grateful. You are always welcome. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey, let me get in on that. Oh absolutely. Oh, boy. Watch that arm. You guys are the best. Where are you off to? Oh don't worry about me. I'll be right back. I have some unfinished business to attend to. - Oh. - Chief. I got your back. Yeah, I got yours, too. Would you like to come in? Oh... That'd be nice. Come on in. What's your problem Amy? I don't have a problem. You're mine. Well come on, let's just go. I don't wanna go on a ride with you. Whoa. Just get out of my way. - Calm down. - Stop. My parents are waiting for me. Mickey, can you move so I can get into my house? Come on Amy, let's take a ride on your bike. I don't wanna take a ride on my bike, I wanna go home. Just get out of my way. What is your problem? - I don't want to- - Hey, is there a problem here? The only problem is you. Beat if before I beat you. Come on Amy, let's just go to the park. I don't want to go to the park. I just wanna go inside. I don't want you to go in with me. Can you just let me go by? - Amy. - Okay, just leave her alone. I warned ya. Scottie! Hey. Hey. Okay. Here. Wait, wait. You've had this the whole time? Yeah. It may sound silly, but it kept me alive. What are you doing with that loser anyway? The only loser here is you. Hey. Hey, wait. - That was awesome. - So, can I join you?
