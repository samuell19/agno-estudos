[cheering] ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the Planet is Burning Tour. And without further ado, it's time to give it up for the person we love, the person we all adore, put your hands together right now for Ilana Glazer. [music - rihanna, "sex with me"] Sex with me so amazing. All this hard work, no vacation. Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation. Hit a switch on a fake nigga like a station. Sex with me so amazing. Vodka and a water, and a lemon. And a few other things I cannot mention. Five fingers on it, five fingers. Hit it like you own it, hit it like I'm on it. Straight shots of the blue dot, shots shots shots shots, baby. I'ma pick your poison. Ooh-ee, yeah, yeah. I'm off that la-la. I'ma get it wet like Jacuzzi. And sex with me so amazing. All this hard work, no vacation. What the fuck is up, Houston? [cheering] Thank you so much. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. [inaudible] So good to see you. Thank you so much for being here. I believe y'all know me as Ilana Wexler from "Broad City." You love it. I love "Broad City." It's my favorite TV show ever. Duh. And I love Ilana Wexler. But I am really excited to introduce you to Ilana Glazer the stand up this evening. Because there are a lot of differences between Ilana Wexler and Ilana Glazer. You're going to be shocked as well as impressed. Like for example, Ilana Wexler obviously wakes and bakes. OK. Hey. You know, she wakes up with a bowl betwixt her breasts from the night before. And she gives it the old one-handed [breathing] oh, yeah. Ilana Glazer, on the other hand, wakes up, takes her vitamins, and then I get high. So Ilana Wexler wake and bake, Ilana Glazer wake, take, and bake. Ilana Wexler is free to buy her weed wherever the fuck. In the street, in a little building nook, biking over the Manhattan Bridge in one swift move. I'll Venmo you later! In my real life, though, I have my husband buy our weed from a New York delivery service, while I hide in the closet scrolling Instagram. I know. It sounds so 1950s. Like, I have my husband buy our weed. While I hide in the closet. I just don't want people knowing where I live. And listen, it's not like I'm like, so famous. It's just that New York weed delivery people make up 80% of my demo. And the other 20% is here tonight. Thank you so much for coming. Oh, thank God you're here. Tejas, I am so excited to be here. So the government is on fire. And so is the planet. The planet is on fucking fire. And the mean dinosaurs in office just don't seem to mind. No. I think they want us to die, because they're about to die. That is the ultimate FOMO. One thing that gives me hope is the gender-nonconforming youth. I think it is amazing. I find it just incredible to see these young people have the agency to say I am non-binary. I don't have that kind of agency. And I literally have agents. It makes me so hopeful that maybe, just maybe, the end of baby boomer culture is nigh. Oh. Because we have been fed the crappiest, most boring script. The script that says that we can only play one of two parts. And that is either that of a masculine man, I don't know. Gun show or whatever. Or we can play, a, oh, yeah, frickin' feminine woman, oh. Oh. It hurts. It really hurts. Wobbling on these tiny little Betty Boop feet. I can barely balance my big Betty Boop boobs. Before a tour, I went to dinner with my friend, who is a gold star lesbian. Now, as a Jewish person, I am not usually a big fan of gold stars. But this one I like. This one I like. A gold star gay girl is a girl who likes ladies, has always known she liked ladies, and has not so much as sniffed a dick. I admire it. And she and I just have a similar vibe. So I asked her, what percentage female to male do you feel? And she thought about it for a second. She was like, I guess I would say, 60% to 70% female, and 30% to 40% male. And I was like, Ro, me too, dude. You took the answer right out of my mouth. That's exactly the ratio I was just going to say. Like, I feel like a little girl. OK? I feel like a woman. OK. I have like, big titties, durr. But also, I feel like a little like, frickin' dude. You know what I mean? Like a... I mean, I partially identify with Mr. Peanut. I'm like, [singing] who wants some salty-ass nuts, huh? Whoo. [singing] Sweetheart, you're looking good, sweetheart. I love that dress on you, honey. And for my sexuality, if I were a drink, I'd be one part gay, and two parts straight. Thank you. You do what you want with your hands. You know, no pressure. It's just whatever you want. Cool. No presh. I'm not waiting. You know, I'm just not desperate for your approval. But one part gay and two part straight. OK? So. You might call that drink a ginatondick. Or like, at a different bar, with a different vibe, a both sexes on the beach. I have one more. OK. Instead of a Martini, a muffpeeny. Oh. Extra nerdy, baby. Yeah. OK. So. As a gold star lesbian, and as a ginatondick, we're not supposed to feel the same. But we do. We like feel that same thing. And I remembered, oh, yeah. The whole thing's a sham. It's a total lie. You know, like, straight guys? Straight guys are supposed to be whoa, the most masculine people in the world. And I'm talking real pussy-loving straight dudes, OK? Not guys who like, resentfully fuck their wives and then run to work and create policy against women's bodies. Those guys are gay? I have no idea. I don't know what's going on there. What's the diagnosis? You know, I don't know. But you know what straight guys like to do? Straight guys love to be enveloped in the warmth and wetness of a woman. Straight guys love to run home and giggle with and share secrets with a girl. It's very gay. And straight women, or women who love dick... So women who love dick, we're not even supposed to love it. We are supposed to merely accept it. That would suck. No, I feel really like, dudely when I'm with a dude. I mean, honestly, when I have a dick anywhere inside of me... Technically, and I want to be technical about it now... AUDIENCE: Oh my God. I have a dick. I am part penis at that point. It's crazy. It feels wild to be a woman attracted to men, you know? If this superior design, a little dick and balls, you know, what? You know how I feel about balls? They make me go... Oh. Little cuties. Love 'em. Because dicks don't gotta say nothing. But balls have to have all the personality. Gay men... growing up, I remember gay men are like women. Hm. Have you ever watched two dudes fuck? It's not so much a female thing. There's not a titty to be sucked, you know? It's not a clit to be rubbed, OK? There's two dicks in that situation, and presumably, four balls. And man. Homophobia is the lamest, most transparent form of hate I can think of. When someone's homophobic, they're just admitting, they think about gay shit all the time. Homophobia is like when someone farts and immediately blames it on someone else. But we all know that he who smelt it is curious about hooking up with another dude. And that is fine. It's healthy. Oh, yes. OK. Y'all know Lil Wayne's "Lollipop?" OK. So like, I don't mean to disparage my future very close friend, OK? I just think he would dig me, you know what I mean? We'd like, see eye to eye. Because I believe we are the same height. Which means we could easily fuck standing up, just saying, any way. Any old way. I got to tell you, this is how "Lollipop" begins on Tha Carter III. [boop sounds] No homo. Huh? Yeah. No homo? Uh... I didn't say homo. Yeah, no, I didn't bring up the concept of one man choking on another man's cock. You did. And then you wrote poetry about it. Gay women, there is no joke. They won. They beat the simulation. It's two out of two, superior, complex partners. They did it. Any menial task a lesbian needs for me, I do. I'm like, you need me to move this table? I got it. I put dicks in my mouth. We don't... No. Stop. I got it. I have to admit. I have a cis male partner. Ew. Just kidding. He's wonderful. I fucking love him. Oh, love him. Love him. He holds the key to my heart. I do this on him. I put my butt up on him. I'm just like, hey. I'm like a dog. Butt up on him. Love him. Delish. But there's something I can't get used to about being married to this person, and that is the word husband. I'm like, hey, nice to meet you. This is my husband. [laughter] Maybe husband. No. He is my husband. I just... no. Sorry. Nothing. And I'm a wife? What? I don't think so. Really? You sure? Husband just sounds like WASP drag coming out of this Jewy mouth. I'm like, oh, my husband, mmhm. Yes, my husband and I, we took a little ride upstate to Bedford to review some property, but nothing quite suited us. No. Oh, don't worry. We'll find something. And of course, there's always the estate. So. Husband also sounds like, I really need my husband to please sign this paperwork so I can finally get a credit card. So I prefer the term partner. But we are both Jewish. So people mistake us for lawyers all the time. My partner is the first pussy-loving straight dude that I ever lived with, um, after my dad. Our parents have sexualities too. Yeah. I lived with my best friend, Matt, who's a gay dude, for like 10 years before I moved in with my partner. And obviously, it was perfect. And then when I moved in with my husband I was like, is this even going to be fun, even? I felt so claustrophobic. I was like, and where am I supposed to cry? I was hiding in the bathroom like... No, no, I'm just... Taking a very long, very painful dump. Oh. And now I'm just, um, cleaning up the disastrous mess. But then it started. We found a groove. Thank God. Honestly, it took like six months, but something clicked. And it just became a sleepover with my best friend where our parents were never coming home. Houston, please do not tell my feminist friends this, OK? But I enjoy making a house a home. I love it. I love like, setting a vibe, you know what I mean? I like, light a little candle. I'm like, whoo. Yes. I pick up a dust bunny, throw it out. Taking care of business. Yeah. Light some incense, I'm like, mm, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe. It's a bit too aromatic. So I'm just like, OK, perfect balance. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. I'm like, peeling a carrot over the garbage can. I'm like, I'm a wife. [laughter] I peel it into a nub and have to throw it out. Oof. I'm not a chef. But one of my favorite things about living with this man is that his razors are in the shower waiting for me to use. Damn. Men's razors are superior to women's razors. It's almost like it was designed that way. No. They wouldn't do that. Hm. Yeah. Men's razors are just excellent quality. The metal is like military-grade. Women's razors are so flimsy. The slightest breeze sends them flying off the shelf of the shower. And someone decided about six, seven years ago, to line the perimeter of women's razors with soap and rubber. Houston, let me ask you something. Be real with me. Do I look too dumb to lather my own leg? OK. Let me ask you another thing. After one shower, doesn't the soap become the texture of cum? I'm getting in the shower to rub cum all over my legs? Why do you think I got in here in the first place? And the rubber on women's razors protrudes past the blade, such that I'm press, press, pressing down to get to the base of the follicle. Like, can I let you know if I want to bowl with bumpers today? Jesus. And the area that men are expected to shave. This. The, um... the saddle. The saddle is like 12 to 15 square inches max. Compared to all this surface area? Come on. It takes me like 40 minutes to shave my legs proper. I could have watched two episodes of "Broad City." Oh, man. I have a disgusting little fantasy I'm going to share with you. The fantasy is that I pay a man to shave my legs for me weekly. Well, here's how it goes, OK? So I set a standing appointment on Fridays. I do it around 1:30, so I'm always taking a half day. I'mma let you guys know I have that personal appointment. I gotta go. Yeah. Email me or text me. I'll see you on Monday. And I go right into the most progressive barbershop in Brooklyn. I'm like, ding a ling a ling. Mario, hi. Mwah. We have like a cute-ass rapport by this point. And I hike up my little dress and I sit in his barber chair like Mork from "Mork and Mindy." OK. So like, Mario, is not like, skimping out on me because I'm a woman. You know? He's not like, giving me shitty service because it's my legs. He totally cares. He's an artisan, OK? He puts hot towels on my legs, opening up the pores, steaming beach towels, y'all. And Mario freehands a straight razor, ankle to damn pussy, all right? He stops right at the crease, because he is a professional. So women's razors are trash. We've decided. It's been decided. But there are some products for women that I appreciate. One of those products is a diva cup. So a diva cup is a reusable period receptacle. It is a little rubber cup. But it doesn't have a flat bottom. The silhouette is that of a long titty bent over. It comes to a long, soft point. And the way you use it is that you bend the cup and fold it like a tiny little piece of pizza. And you put it at the base of your vagina. And you go... [breathing] And you wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. You relax and receive. You do not block, OK? And once it's up far enough, it goes... [pop] Out to its original shape. And... [pop] Suctions to the cervix. And bitch, I promise you. Your uterine lining is slip slide dancing all the way down. Splashing about. And the way you use it throughout the day is that you find yourself a single occupancy bathroom. Can't stress that enough. Learn from my mistakes, OK? And you pull your pants down. And you bear down just enough to give a slow birth to a little rubber cup. But not enough to poop. So you grab it. And then you go, oh my God. What? And you waddle up to the sink. And you dump it. And you go... [shuddering noises] Whoa. And you rinse and repeat. Simple. I am ashamed to admit this. But for the first few months of using my diva cup, I would use it only at home. And my husband would put it in for me. He's that kind of dude. He's that kind of man. Loves pussy, I guess, too. That doesn't hurt. He was like, baby, chill. Chill. Relax and receive, baby, ow, my shoulder. I was like, oh, fuck. I don't know about this, man. Shit. Stop. Stop. No. Go. Just keep going. Sorry. Oh, where's it going to go? Oh. Where did I think it was going to go? [wet sounds] It's gone. We're not able to relocate the... We've lost, um... an hour later, I'm like, see? You see? What a fucking baby I was. I needed my daddy to put my little diva cup in for me. Even though it's so intense, I prefer a diva cup to a tampon. Tampons hurt. Cotton is so dry. That's like, its whole thing. And I'm going to put that in my delicious, juicy pussy? Get out of here. I've never taken a tampon out without going... Ow. And the thing we all know about pads is that they're very insulting. Do I look like a baby in a diapie to you? Is that what I look like? A frustrated infant sitting in my stuff? It's not like pads work. You know what I mean? There's no like, pad technology that whisks away the... No. No. It just sits there. Magnetic force pulls the stuff... Nope. It just sits there. My last ditch effort with pads, as though I owed them anything, were to make them my overnight plan. So I would find my most stretched out, faded, holey, stained pair of underwear, balled up in the corner of the closet from last month, slap a fattie on that thang. And just in case, I would lay a towel down, like I'm a dog coming in from the rain. And I'm like, this is good. This is going to be good. All taken care of. Until a trickle, trickle, trickle is just leaking out the side, all night. Leaking out the side onto my thigh. All night. Because remember, it doesn't work. Meanwhile, the weight of my top thigh is crush, crush, crushing the pad, such that the sticky is sticking to itself. And it gets stuck right here, in the barber's crease. Like, hey, are we testing these products for you? Are these to market yet, or? So. Suffice it to say, that's why I prefer a diva cup. There's something that doesn't feel totally cohesive about it to me. And that's that I can't think of an action, nor a product, that is less diva-like. You know, I can't picture J-Lo like, bending and folding and searching for a single occupancy bathroom. Please, it's an emergency. Please, please. Mariah Carey is like, clutching her diva cup, waddling in stripper heels to the sink. No. Celine Dion's bearing down just the right amount. She's like, [singing impression] Oh, shit. It happens. My mom told me that pads used to have belts on them. A pad and then a belt? Yeah. I am grateful to be a woman in 2019. It is the best it's been yet. Oh. Bummer. No, we're really grateful to be here. Thank you, [SILLY VOICE] so much for having us, I'm so happy to be here! Thank you, thank you so much for having us! Oh, no. Forget the thing I said before. It's a good time to be a Jewish woman in 2019. Except that the Nazis are making a comeback. Nazis are so annoying. They're so pesky. But the Nazis in this country, I don't know, they're no Hitler's Nazis. And I know. I grew up studying the Holocaust in Hebrew school. Against my will. They were real intense about it. They showed us a lot of stuff real young. Footage of the trains, and pictures of the mountains of glasses and piles of dead people's shoes and dead bodies. They were like, never forget. I was like, I can't. I'm six. It was fear mongering up in my shul. Dudes, you are not going to believe this story I'm about to tell you. Get ready, dawgs. Fuck. OK. In Hebrew school, we did a weeks-long simulation of escaping the Holocaust to try to get to the New World. Yeah. As a kid I LARPed the Holocaust. Swear to God. Swear to her. My parents paid good money for me to do Holocaust play. I guess there wasn't enough real, imminent danger for Jewish children in Long Island. So we got to create it. Huh? Yeah. The kids who were already bar and bat mitzvah'd got to play the role of the guards. And we would trade pennies and pretzels to get to the next level. It was just a series of dimly lit hallways, OK. But we end up at a wedding in the Jewish ghetto. Education. And we're all like, [speaking hebrew].. When suddenly, the lights start flashing on and off. And we hear... Where are the Jews? And we were like, [screaming]. And I shit you not. After three minutes of children screaming, the lights turn on, and my teacher's like... You thought you'd escape? Not such luck, my little Jews. So it's fully psycho. Yeah, nuts. What is that? But also, I'm like, I guess they kind of had a point? Because they are back in a big way. But the Nazis in our country are such a mess. Like, their branding is very loose. Like, they don't even have like, a look, you know? They have that red hat, but. They really just look like a bunch of golfers who've been sitting in the sun for too long. And their merch is from Party City? I'm like, I could have picked up a dozen tiki torches. I'm not impressed by you. But Hitler's Nazis, if we're comparing Nazis, they were on point. They just had so much art direction. Like, brand concept meeting after brand concept meeting, after brand concept meeting. Do you know that the Nazi costume was designed by Hugo Boss of Macy's fame? Yeah. And like, I admired Hugo Boss clothing as a kid? Like, it was legit. I'd go to the mall with my mom. And we would pass the Hugo Boss display. And I'd be like, I don't know, mom. I feel like a Hugo Boss button down would be pretty cool for the chorus concert. I just, I mean, they just were so creative about it. They were so enthusiastic. I feel like Hitler's Nazis liked the production of a Holocaust more than they even hated Jews. I think they liked the buzz, you know? The meetings. And they were always whispering about shit and creating like a secret coded language and shit. And they would write essays and write whole books and film and document, and they would like have little clipboards and run around town like putting up their flyers. They're like, yeah, meeting's tonight. Be there or be square. I drew that. That Jewish rat? I drew that. Yeah. Shading. Check it out. Like the Nazis acted like they hated us. But I'm like, y'all were obsessed with us. The Nazis were totally gay for the Jews. Starting off with over the knee patent leather boots. I'm like, someone's putting fashion before function, OK? They're cutting off their knee mobility to gestapo around town? They're like, no, it's totally worth it. They look so cool. I mean, if I were to gestapo around town, I'm not cutting off the knee. I wouldn't even cut off the ankle. I would do like a low rise cleat. For like gripping the cobblestones. And also like, power. You know? That walk. I just, if you were to say to me, Ilana, come at me, bro. Like a, you fucking hate me. And b, oh, you're going to fucking kill me. I would lead with the head and shoulders. I'd give you a fucking mean fucking look. I'd be like, I want to be as ugly as possible. And, oh shit. I'm lifting the knees. Like, I'm coming at you, bitch. Watch the fuck out. Not Hitler's Nazis. No, no. They preferred a leg extension and a leg extension, and a leg extension, and a leg extension, oh. Ice queen all day. Serving Aryan apathy. They don't care. They don't fucking care. They figured out the gay haircuts 70 years in advance. How'd they do that? Did the Nazis have a time machine? Honestly. They like, time travel to 2015 Williamsburg, Brooklyn. They were like, oh, shit, bitch. This is it. Yeah. Oh. We're going tight on the sides and long on top, boys. Let's go. Oh. You see how it flows on top and then stays neat on the sides? I love that. You look wunderbar, Rolf. Oh. Sometimes I wonder what might have happened if there was some sort of Grindr back then. Like, maybe we should make some sort of neo-Nazi Grindr app tonight. Although my brother Elliott tells me that's kind of what Grindr is already, so. Oh. Yeah. That hate shows up in the most surprising of spaces. You know, I grew up thinking there were progressive spaces and then conservative spaces. But it's all a fucking mess. Like New York is so liberal. Mm-mm. It's fucking racist and misogynist and terrifying at times. Hollywood's so progressive. OK. If Hollywood is so progressive, why is Mel Gibson still here? Get outta here, Mel, come on. Mel Gibson has said terrifying things publicly about black people, women, Jews. I'm like, who do you think did your deal for Daddy's Home 2? Australians? Jews, baby. Jews. They're up in there, fighting for your back end. What are you doing? Mel Gibson was once recorded calling his ex-wife a glum cunt for not sucking his dick in a hot tub. Sweet baby Mel, let me tell you something. Melly, Melly G, you can't suck a dick underwater. It doesn't work. There's no suction. It's like... [sounds]. Also, a girl would drown. Mel Gibson has eight movies in production this year. I love that face. Oh, no. Yeah. IMDB. Shit. I just won't be seeing any of them, I guess. You know, I haven't... Have I ever seen a Mel Gibson movie? I hope not. I haven't seen "Braveheart." I get it already. I know what "Braveheart" is, you know? Mel Gibson plays like a... White warrior. Painted blue. Wow. You want to see "Braveheart"? This is fucking "Braveheart". [screaming] You just watched "Braveheart." That's it. I just saved you two hours and 58 minutes. So humble of them not to hit the three hour mark. I just feel like I don't have to see the classics. I fucking get it. They're the patriarchy reduced to two hours. I've seen them all. You know? I'm like, do I ever have to see "Casablanca"? Must I? I get it already. "Casablanca" is like, title card. And some baseball glove-looking dude has a much younger, much hotter girlfriend. And he's like, here's looking at you, kid. Roll credits. Yikes. OK, I've seen this one. I get it. I've never seen "Star Wars". Oh. I get it. There is a war in the stars. From my understanding, it is very soft, very titillating brother-sister incest porn. And then they have the gall to make the blackest guy in the galaxy, Darth Vader, an absentee father. Yeah. No thanks. I've seen this one. Thanks. Hard pass. Yeah. Maybe we should burn it down and start fresh. I'm trying. You know, I try. I'm in this industry of film and TV. And I have no references beyond "Get Out" and "Hey Arnold." I'm an idiot. Really. I'm a dumb dumb. I don't know what's up. So I watched "Rear Window" recently. It was fine. It was interesting. But there was one thing I could not get past. And that was Grace Kelly's tiny little voice. Ooh. Ah. Oh. I was like, what, bitch? Speak up. Yeah, I can't hear you, bitch. Louder. I want to hear what you're saying. No, no. Mm-mm. This voice was designed. This voice is perfectly received by the male eardrum. Never too high. She's not a shrill bitch. And never too low. You know what that means. It's not that. Never that. You could hear the spittle on her wet baby lips. She sounded as though a doe was suddenly given the ability to speak. And all the women at this time sounded this way. You know, like Audrey Hepburn. And you know, I like, love Audrey Hepburn too. Or whatever. But they sounded the same exact way. You know, like, I guess they went to like the same finishing school to learn how to walk and talk like a lady. All the consonants were stretched out. And the vowels never quite found their shape. They always sounded like, oh, everything's wonderful. Isn't it wonderful? Everything? This world that men have designed for us. They're very clever, those men. You have to give them that. So I recently found out why these classic beauties sounded like this in these classic films. And it's because when they would come in for an audition, the old Hollywood director would jizz right in their mouths. And if the young starlet were lucky enough to get the part, she'd have to keep it in her mouth for the whole shoot. Oh. Terrible. Awful. Imagine that. A Dixie cup's worth of jizz being stored in your cheeks like chipmunks for upwards of 40 business days. No. Oh, can you picture having to spit out a load at night into a shot glass and put it back in before hair and makeup in the morning? No. Terrible. Oh. Now I guess we know why their mouths are always in that shape. Oh. Ah. Oh. Mm-hmm. Finishing school indeed. Terrible. Awful. I am grateful for my foremothers who came before me in this industry. You know, they made it a safer place for me to work in. And I'm excited. I'm fucking jazzed about the momentum women are gaining right now. I think we're close, you know. Me Too and Time's Up. Women are taking a giant step forward in a cute fucking wedge. And we're close, y'all. We are so close. I think we are so close to taking it back. We are like, hand on head about to wrap this shit up close. I just hope we can do it before the planet bursts into flames. Thank you, Houston. Appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you for being at my first special. [inaudible] forever. I love you, [inaudible]. [music playing]
