Give me some with chocolate, pistachios, everything. Run, man, run! Where's my son? Where's my son? - No network - After a 2-week respite, another terror attack in Jerusalem. Once again, at the main market... A woman earrying a bomb on her body. The terrorist entered the market near the bakery which has known attacks'in the past. Mayor Ehud Olmert had left the bakery just before the explosion. I was right here. I was in the bakery a minute before. Everything was bustling, everything was fine. Friday morning I was buying challah for Shabbat, like many others. A minute later there were six corpses lying here on the sidewalk and hundreds of people... Thank God, Ruti'leh. Is everyone all right? I don't know, Mom. I just came in. Where are the kids? I don't know, all lines are busy. How did you get through? I was at the market. What were you doing there? Lots of errands, and' I bought halva for Ofer... Oh, someone's at the door. Maybe Ofer. Ofer? Someone's at the door. Collecting donations. You can give 5 or 10. Now? Do your parents know? Alright. Wait a sec. Oh. I forgot. an ate a wfflclii lias suffered terrorist attacks recently Just two days after the attack, at... Wow! Why didn't I see you? I looked at the window. Crawling through a war zone... Come here. I missed you so much. So skinny... -What did you do? Adopted children at risk? e have no change. I felt bad. I didn't have coins. What a mess. Ambulances, police, traffic jams. I just... got off the bus and walked. Yes. I bought you... What kind of halva do you like? Pistachio? Chocolate? Why the face? I think I forgot it there... 'm not crazy about halva. Really? I thought it was your_favorite. I'm sick of it. We have it-every day. Okay, so you can have some-soup. And there's cake. You want some schnitzel? I have to shower. I spent all night on a Caterpillar that came off in the mud. Go ahead. Soup after the shower, or cake first? Soup sounds great. Great. I'm joining the army. They asked her, "Did you come here to enlist?" She said, "No, I came here to live. "But if you live here you should enlist. "It's part of the deal." A woman suicide bomber blew up at Jerusalem's main market. Six people were killed, dozens wounded. Nothing prevented the attack, neither increased security nor "Defensive Shield", not even Secretary of State Colin Powell, wind was near the site of the attack. Hello? Yes. He's here. He just came home. n the shower. Who Is this? Shimrit. Weren't you his classmate? Sorry, I was thinking of someone else. Ok. Bye. Ofer, are you out yet? -What? You had a phone call. Who was it? Shimrit. Your soup is getting cold. In the market, near the bakery... What is this? -How's it going? Where's Dad? Flirting with Gabi on the stairs. She was going to the, market Tell him Ofer's here. This was already on the news... What's that? -So I took it in a bit... What do you think? Not bad. You ruined a new shirt... was asking Ofer. How's sehodl? -Fine... I'm going to a rock show with Shir tonight. How's the army? -The army... I've had enough. Eat, eat. Is everything qk? LVe checked who was in the car. He was nervous and drove off. The boom came ten minutes later. I was at the market... -How fast do you run 10 km? Why should I run? I was at the market, right here. Last week I ran 10 km in less than an hour. Reuven wanted to meet, so I went to his studio. Ofer Rosen, Platoon C. In the market? Are you crazy? Pass the salt. Got it I think he touched me. -Who, Reuven? No, the terrorist. A strange man. A black Arab. He looked nervous. They dropped him off. The car waited for him right here. I have to go back to the army. Was that Shimrit?! -Shimrit from Operations. We have to be at Camp Ofer by 6 PM. Cool. Did you name him after the base? Why? I don't know. It was obvious we'd retaliate. They haven't evacuated the casualties yet. What do you want from me? I'll drop you off. I'm jogging at 6 PM. I'll take you. A bomb around his waist... That triathlon... It's taking over your life, I just hope we can... What will you do there? Probably unload the tanks. The briefing was general, where the tanks enter. So it's not a response! The attack was less than two hours ago! Everybody knows there'll be an attack. Just not when and where. The army has plans. Really? So do I. I used to... The market was reopened two hours after the explosion. Traffic is back to normal, life isn't. Are you ok? Yes What's that? I didn't notice. Must be from this morning. 'll clean it. Can't we have one weekend of peace? It's the army. It's not his decision. It'll be alright. Don't worry. What's left for me to do? You think I'm not worried? So why do you rush to send him back? This way he'll have more time at home. Have dinner, rest... It's not his fault. -He didn't start it, either. That's exactly what I mean. What? -You weaken him. You undermine his confidence. He may go to war tomorrow. Thanks for reminding me. These kids are 18 years old. We have to rely on them. Make him feel confident. Trust him. Him I trust, not the army. He's in a tank, isn't he? -So? A tank weight 50 tons, maybe more. Ofer, what does your tank weigh? 82 tons, without the shells. He's safe inside a tank. Palestinians don't have anti-tank missiles. That's reassuring.. He'll be fine. -Really? How do you know? I know. Want some coffee? -No. Your cake burned because you forgot the "heat dispersal." But despite all our efforts and all the preparations a single attacker can't always be stopped. The American TV crews that came to cover Powell's visit had a chance to witness one of the terrorist attacks that brought about the visit. The police assume that despite IDF actions in the Occupied Territories the terrorists will attempt more attacks of this kind. ...Frightened, confused and don't know what to do and someone has to give them an answer. Mom. Mom. It's alright, honey. Go back to sleep. Hello? Cami? Hi. This is Ruti. Can I still order a delivery? Great. Send me five boxes of chocolate cereal, twenty bars of chocolate... Yes. Cakes. I have guests. A lot. Milk, milk... Two packs of chips. Do you have the big ones? Great. Any chicken left? No? Thighs? Okay. Ten. No? Okay. Seven? Great. Then add some legs. Four or five. What else? Oh, pasta. Very important. 5, 6 packs. All shapes. Great. Listen, I'm out. Don't ring, leave it by the door. Ok? Shabbat shalom. Thanks. Bye-bye. - 6 new messages - Jerusalem, used to these attacks, sends all ambulances. Dozens of casualties are evacuated... Begin Blvd, is jammed. No. That's a much better way. It'll take ages for the tanks to get out. The Police hadn't received many warnings, but due to Sec. of State Powell's visit large forces were deployed... - Tanks are blocking the road, wait for me - Mom... Mom Why didn't you wake us up? Ofer, let's go. Should I pick your parents after jogging? Your pasta's ready. We're late. Where's my mobile? Are we going? I don't have time. I have to go. The tanks will be there at six.

Isn't that the car lock I got you? It's unhandy for the car. Unhandy? That's what I keep telling you. I locked the house and nobody's going out. What? Ok... We're late. Come on, Mom. -She said no "come on". I'm serious. Nobody's leaving. Ok? But why? What is this? I need my mobile to tell them I'm late, otherwise I'm done for. Don't you get it? I turned off all the phones. don't understand... After an hour absence I'll be confined. We're about 1:40 behind Behind who? Behind the world. Noa, do you want some cocoa? -Cocoa?

Just great. 4 U I'll run slower... Good night My mobile... What are you doing? -What a shame... It absorbs all the cooking oil. Do you want me to put it in the fridge? Wrap it up, at least. Stop making a mess. Can you stop with your pictures? I need my mobile. Tell me where is it. Put everything back. I can't clean up after you. Be careful! That's boiling oil. How could you do this? You must realize what you're doing to me. You're right, Ok? ©We me the key. -There is none. What? -No key. Don't you understand I have to go? You don't realize what they put me through. I'm begging you, please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry. This is insane. How long, Mom? How long do you plan to go on with this? Until there's peace. I don't know. But Mom, there's a concert... -I know! Unbelievable. What do you want? Not only is my commander . giving me hell, I come home and you do this? What am I doing? Making meatballs, like any normal mother. Open the door! This is insane. It's saner than being up all night and popping sleeping pills that don't even help. Can you leave the boiling oil and talk calmly? Yes Help! Noa! Help! Help! Help! She said she'd come at 8:00. She's never late. Maybe they left a message. No message. No answer. Maybe they went to visit Ofer at his base? They did that two weeks ago. They should have told us. I would have sent the cake with them. There's no mobile network in the desert. Besides, she's probably shaken up from the explosion. Do you want to eat? Sure. Is there anything? Of course. -What? You'll see. What? -Chicken legs. That sounds good. What are you supposed to do there? I'm supposed to be there If he puts me on trial I'll be stuck there for 35 days. They can even give me a week in jail. Don't worry, I'll deal with that.

Choppers are circling Infantry are running through the alleys.T. Do you think she's alright? You don't have any more bullets, do you? What's the matter with you? Do you plan to just sit here? Let's calm down. She's out of her mind. I'm trying to understand her. What's to understand? She's going through menopause. Her progesterone and estrogen are out of balance... Where did you come up with that? From the internet, moron! I've been thinking. And? You don't realize I'm doing this for your sake. What's wrong with being home? We have food, we're together. Together? What for? Wouldn't you rather be home than in Ramallah, or God knows where? Then keep him here, but why me? How long will we be stuck here? I just want peace and quiet. Crazy, it's crazy! At least I'm doing something. They'll send me to jail because of you. You're already in jail. He isn't in jail, he's at home. We're reasonably safe here.

It's my job to protect you. You are crazy. Do you hear what you're saying? You both sit here listening to her nonsense. Stop it What time is it? About... -What is it, an hour forty? An hour twenty? It's like foreign time. I can feel the jet-lag. Everyone's waiting for me at the club and I'm here, suggesting you reasonable ideas. I must be going crazy too. Saying she's crazy doesn't help.

Are you really interested? ©k, look. This is Reuven's work. This is his work? Don't get it dirty. What do you want now? Look. Who painted this? Mom, I think. She used to paint. When you were young? No, before that. When she studied at art school. This, isAiit, Art on a cafe napkin. I didn't notice he put it here. You didn't know he drew you? I saw him draw me. He's always scribbling.

How could you do this without consulting me? Shouldn't we decide together? You wouldn't have agreed. -Right. -That's the reason. You lock me in without asking my opinion. Which is important, isn't it? What's important? My life. The kids. The jogging I missed. You forgot it's important to me? How could I forget? You never stop talking about it. "What's your score?" Your son comes home on leave after a month. You have no idea what he's going through. The first question you ask is "what's your score?" What are you, a child? Are you competing with him? You're intolerable. What's important to me is peanuts to you. What's important? Your stupid obsession with nutrition and calories if your bike weighs 7 or 8 lbs or God knows what. Whether Naama runs like a doe or Doe runs like Naama. What? Nothing. Do you want me to run with you? Are you interested? -Ask me sometime. So you can say it's a waste of time? It really is. For me, at least. All you care about is your jogging. You don't even talk about your work. I'm dying to jog now. Where's that sock? I never have pairs. I have an affair with Naama. There, you looked at me. An affair? I just checked if you were listening. I don't believe you. t's true. I wanted to see if you'd look up. Those text messages were from Naama. What text messages? You had six. -What text messages? You slept with her. What are you doing? Tidying up Move! You're in the way. Why? W did you tell me that? To see if you were listening. How did you think it would affect me? I didn't think anything. -That I'd long for you? I would throw out half this closet. I wanted you to look at me. Liar. The operation was halted but the firing continues. Posts are still being guarded. What are you watching? The news. You're missing all the action. Is that like your tank? Mine is much better.

He's a monk. He probably went to bed. Did you ever see him? -No. Maybe there is no monk. -Who turns the light on and off? Look, it's not far at all. Mom's going to kill us. Mom again? I only told you that story to stop your automatic response to me. All I know is, while I'm wandering around every night too anxious to sleep, you find other things to do. I'm worried about Ofer, too. -Oh, really? When? When you fuck her? Where do you do it? I told you it's not true. In your office, on the carpet? n the car? In her apartment. don't want to talk about it. eweeN She must be pretty. Young, huh? And interesting. You're more. What are you waiting for? What good will it do? Let's say I make it, then what? Gaby left. You go in and call the police. Do I turn Mom in? That's wrong. You're fucked up. I still love you. You're good at saying that.

Where did he come from? He fell onto Gaby's porch. I don't know what happened. What do you mean, "fell"? How? Hold on. Sorry. Ofer, are you all right? -It hurts... Where does it hurt? There.
