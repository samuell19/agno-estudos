Sorry... ﻿Are you a virgin? -I'm a Scorpio. ﻿Have you slept with a man? -How dare you ﻿Are you a virgin? -You again? ﻿Are you innocent? -Yes. ﻿Dumb question. ﻿Would you only marry a virgin? -No, not at all. ﻿Are you a virgin? -Are you nuts? ﻿And you? -None of your business. ﻿Would you prefer an innocent girl? -Haven't tried it. ﻿Excuse me, are you a virgin? -Yes. ﻿Do you want to marry as a virgin? -No. ﻿Virginity, purity, innocence: ﻿Terms that decades ago were deeply engrained in people's moral conscience ﻿have been replaced by a simple formula: ﻿Sex liberates, and liberation is good. ﻿In the early days, women's abstinence ﻿was an integral part of an ideology ﻿that condemned girls who lived by the motto: ﻿"Therefore test, who wants to bind himself forever." ﻿Desire was the devil's work, ﻿and only that which was received in a state of purity could remain pure. ﻿The experience of defloration was closely tied to the awareness ﻿of losing one's most precious thing. The pain of defloration warned of the sinfulness passed on by Eve. ﻿This cycle of guilt could only be broken by willful virgins ﻿and wives who abstained from pleasure in bed. ﻿After everything school and church had taught them, ﻿women saw in this an irrevocable law as old as the world itself. ﻿We are in a time long before the bible was written. ﻿We meet two people who could be Adam and Eve. ﻿Man, once one with the plants and the animals, had lost his ignorance, ﻿and with it his innocence and paradise. ﻿When man began to live consciously he also began to love consciously. ﻿The state of virginity ends with defloration, ﻿a Latin word that means "withering away." ﻿It is the flower's goal to attract insects in order to be pollinated. In the moment of pollination the flower dies, and the fruit begins to ripen. For ancient man the world was full of inscrutable mysteries. ﻿He believed nature was controlled by gods and demons. The phallus was the symbol of fertility ﻿Sun, water, and phallus ﻿were the primal forces that kept the trive alive. The concept of sin was still unknown, but there were taboos. Young girls were taboo. Intercourse before sexual maturity would have jeopardized their later fertility. Infertile women, however were useless to the community. ﻿Not to infuriate the phallus, girls had to keep their virginity ﻿until the tribal priest consecrated them ﻿After that, virgins were a disgrace to the tribe. ﻿but who was to spare the girl the discrace? ﻿Those with power ruled, and the women had to comply. ﻿The priests weren't always on the side of the lovers. Tribal interests had to be protected, and priests needed the gods' blessing. Obviously the gods didn't bless these young lovers, ﻿and so the priest didn't approve of them either. ﻿The prettiest, blessed girls sacrificed their virginity to the river god. ﻿Only men of the noblest descent were allowed to take the so deflowered women ﻿In South-East Asia a person is expected ﻿to regard sex as a pleasurable experience. ﻿Sex is expertly taught ﻿and doesn't disrupt the social order. The natives forgive minor affairs, but despise passionate choices ot lovers. ﻿and have, no place for somebody who, ignoring social mores, ﻿continues to make, his own choice instead of taking a socially suitable partner. ﻿People tried to fathom the mysteries of life. ﻿They let their hair grow and set out ﻿to seek solitude in search of the meaning of life. ﻿But their minds were still weak, ﻿and they were overcome by carnal desire. ﻿So they developed ways to numb their bodies, ﻿for they believed that the body kills the mind. ﻿They began to eat thistles, ﻿for even eating should be without pleasure. ﻿They found ever new ways to control their sinful thoughts, ﻿but their minds were still too weak. ﻿And finally, to suppress their involuntary sensations, ﻿they sat in an anthill. ﻿They sat like this for weeks. ﻿But the way to paradise was not revealed to them. The middle ages. The tree of knowledge was reduced to its sexual fruits. ﻿Man's worst sin was to do what God had enabled him to do: to love. The daughter of the 19th century had the same desires, ﻿but society didn't allow them. ﻿The natural awakening of her young body felt like Satan's work. ﻿Unexpectedly, the blood of her first menstruation burst from her body. Anna! ﻿Aren't you ashamed of yourself? ﻿Do you want to ruin us? On your knees! ﻿Poor child! Friedrich will be a good husband- ﻿I hope so. ﻿My poor child! ﻿You know what I expect. -Yes. ﻿She's the most precious thing I have. -I shall spoil her. ﻿Humbug! You are the lord of the house! ﻿Friedrich, you're a man, after all. ﻿But promise to honor the mother ot your children! Forgive me... ﻿I now must... ﻿Anna... ﻿Forgive me... -Friedrich, I... ﻿It must be done... -I want to be a dutiful wife! ﻿Well, then! ﻿Be brave! ﻿All extramarital defloration had serious consequences for a girl and her family. ﻿We know of early documentation about ways to "reestablish” virginity. ﻿Inserting glass dust the night before was successful but dangerous. ﻿Poppy juice was also said to be effective. ﻿The French preferred a more human method. ﻿A fish bladder filled with pigeon blood was placed inside the bride. ﻿Blood-soaked sponges were reported to be used in Germany, ﻿as well as in Russia and Persia. ﻿These people are trying to determine whether the girl is still a virgin. ﻿"Sit her on the opening of a wine cask. ﻿A deflowered girl will smell, a virgin won't,” says a book. ﻿In another virginity test from the 14th century ﻿girls had to drink burnt ivy roots dissolved in water. ﻿If she wasn't a virgin, she passed it immediately. ﻿What a just world! A girl's guilt or innocence was decided ﻿by the size of her bladder. ﻿For gardens infested with caterpillars ﻿the North Italians of the Middle Ages had a wonderful remedy: ﻿A naked virgin... and a monk... ﻿had to meet before sunrise. ﻿Why the girl had to be naked and the monk didn't, remains a mystery. ﻿We can't blame the holy man for running after the girl like this. A book entitled "Gestriegelte Rockenphilosophie,” ﻿published in 1709, predicts a life of bad luck for the man ﻿who meets a pure virgin in the morning. ﻿The Lithuanians had an cure for fleas: ﻿A naked virgin had to sweep the house on the first day of Easter. ﻿During the witch trials, judges of the Holy Inguisition questioned ﻿what the accused had done with their first menstruation blood ﻿and, if they weren't virgins, with their defloration blood. ﻿The quarrelsome participants of enlightened Christianity had found out ﻿that the menarche blood and the defloration blood ﻿were powerful ingredient for making magic potions. ﻿Confess! ﻿Increase the torture! ﻿In some rural areas it is still custom to flaunt the sheets ﻿to prove the bride's defloration and the groom's potency. ﻿Are you, married -No. ﻿Do you have girlfriend? -Yes. Was she a virqin? -No. ﻿Is a girl's innocence important to you? ﻿No... I really don't care. ﻿What? -Do women still care about virginity? ﻿I hope not. I hope women have enough dignity to stay away from those people. ﻿Is virginity still important tor girls? -I'd say so. ﻿Why? Because it f-feels different the first time. ﻿Are you married? -No, thank God. ﻿Is virginity important today? -No. Does it still exist? ﻿Are you married? -I'm Italian. Are ﻿you married? -Italian. ﻿Are you married? -Impossible... ﻿Would you want your daughter to marry as a virgin? ﻿No, she should gain experience. ﻿My first love was only 16. Oh, I hope my daughter's still a virgin! ﻿My dad's more liberal than my mom. ﻿My folks are liberal too. As long as they don't know what's going on. ﻿And what is going on? Come on, tell me. I'll ﻿show you sometime. -Can't wait! ﻿Want to come upstairs? -Why not, now that we're here. ﻿Great. I got some new records, cool stuff. And my mom's not home. ﻿She's at the doctor's tor a couple of hours. ﻿So I can turn up the volume. ﻿Georg, I can't stay for very long. ﻿Come on... ﻿Thanks. ﻿Nice place. Tell me... Tell me... ﻿Have you been with a girl and all? -Sure. ﻿With more than one? -Sure. ﻿Just petting or more? -More. ﻿Jesus... ﻿Is there a bathroom here? -No, we don't wash... I'll show you. ﻿I'll be right back. See you! ﻿Georg, why don't you turn it up a bit? ﻿Let it ring... ﻿can't... ﻿I just can't. It﻿'s not working. ﻿Hi, Christine. -Hi, Mr. Silinann. ﻿Nobody home? ﻿I saw your father on the Ku'damm. He was being interviewed by a reporter. ﻿Maybe we'll see him on TV. ﻿You don't have a key? -No. ﻿Come on in. I ﻿can't let you wait on the mat like a dog. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Make yourself at home. What would you like? ﻿Whiskey? ﻿Port? ﻿Vodka? Cognac? No, wait! We'll have champagne! ﻿One sec. ﻿Cheers. ﻿Is that a play you're in? -No, but I enjoy acting it out. ﻿May I have a look? ﻿Like it? ﻿Is that art too? ﻿It depends. ﻿My parents always say I'm too young for love. ﻿You're never too young for happiness. ﻿You're a pretty girl. ﻿We've known each other for five years. That's when I moved in. ﻿You're still a virqin, riqht? Right! ﻿What's that supposed to be? -Oh, you'll see, my little bird. I ﻿can't wait. ﻿And here's the magic trick. ﻿Cheers. ﻿I tell you, you must kidnap her. ﻿But that'll cost you. ﻿Oh, of course! Till tonight. ﻿Come! ﻿Let's go! ﻿This fiery lover will of course say that the kidnapped girl was no virgin, ﻿but a disreputable person with whom any Roman could have sex unpunished. ﻿If the family can prove that she was a virgin, the couple has broken the law. ﻿But it is not in the father's interest to have her punished. ﻿So they settle the matter ﻿with the means ot communication that, to this day, solves all disputes. ﻿Hence the expression, "Sold down the river.” ﻿This custom of forcing a virgin into marriage through kidnapping and rape ﻿is still alive in Sicily. ﻿Another form of defloration aimed at begging for the blessings of the gods. ﻿But here our old friend isn't called "phallus,” but "mutunus tutunus.” ﻿It was crucial to ensure that the defloration here was complete. ﻿Only then was it going to be a fruitful and blissful marriage. ﻿Nothing indicates any connection between the Homans ﻿and the natives of North America. ﻿Still, we find the same tradition here. ﻿Medicine men on some lndian islands prepared women for self defloration ﻿by burning herbs. The smoke enveloping the girl's genitals ﻿made her feel an urgent desire for love-making. ﻿As the biting smoke makes the girl fall slowly into a state of ecstasy, ﻿her tribe dances to bring on the blessings of the gods. ﻿This ritual is not pertormed for every girl ﻿who becomes a woman through self-defloration. ﻿but only for daughters of families holding high rank within the tribe. ﻿Only after this ceremony is the girl integrated into the community. ﻿She then awaits the man her family chose, ﻿whereby her feelings and preferences are not taken into account. ﻿Important for the selection of a spouse are: his tribal ranking. ﻿the resulting family ties, ﻿and the price his family is able to pay. ﻿She has now crossed the threshold ﻿from childhood to womanhood. ﻿Now the time has come tor Arg-Pan, the god ot fertility. ﻿The medicine men make final preparations. F﻿rom Cambodia, Christian missionaries of earlier centuries reported ﻿that the groom's family accompanied the couple to to priest, ﻿who alone could break the taboo, for he was stronger than the demons. The bride was thus protected, but also at the mercy of the priest. Even though various cultures influence human development in different ways, ﻿there are still commonalities in sexual development ﻿that exist in every known culture. ﻿When regarding varying educational methods in different societies ﻿we realize that there are commonalities every culture has to reckon with. ﻿After defloration by the chief the girl awaits the chosen one. ﻿Back to the middle ages, ﻿"The maid pays a ransom for her wedding night: a bucket as big as her butt,” ﻿which was complicated if the estate belonged to the church. The monks demanded the same as the feudal lords, ﻿of course waiving their right to the first night. ﻿Some are said to have claimed it anyway, but, sorrily, there isn't any proof. ﻿Cheating was not allowed. The bucket had to be "just as big as her butt." ﻿Not too big and not too small. ﻿Let's return to our topic: the right to the first night. ﻿May I enter, please? I have a request. ﻿It's time tor my daughter to get married. ﻿I've chosen Heinrich Zimmermann. -Again? ﻿What's going on? We just had a wedding last week’ ﻿I'm not the youngest anymore. ﻿So be it. ﻿Then Zimmermann shall take her. ﻿No, sir, not without your blessings. ﻿Come, stand up. ﻿Is she pretty? - Yes. ﻿You must see her, sir. A delicate child, long lashes, hair like silk, dark eyes. ﻿A soft and round body. ﻿So this is the rascal he chose for you. -Yes, sir. ﻿And you love him? -Yes, sir. ﻿He hasn't taken what is mine, has he? -No, sir. ﻿She's too well brought up to disregard the rules of the church. ﻿You can go now. Go on. ﻿Not you, my child. ﻿Heaven will redeem your goodness. - Yes, yes... Go have a jug of wine. ﻿Now go on! The Lord will reward you. ﻿Our lord is very gracious. He gave Anna damask and fine lace. ﻿And Margarete a golden necklace. ﻿Because he was satisfied with her. ﻿Wait, you,must earn it first, my child. ﻿Oh, dear God! ﻿Satan is with you? You're a witch! You bewitched me! ﻿No girl wanted to be called a witch. The old question arises: What came first, the chicken or the egg? ﻿Did female seduction ruin men first? ﻿Or did women invent it as a weapon against oppression? ﻿Her reward was surely not easily gained. ﻿Thus the church allowed these not so virginal virgins ﻿to wear the myrtle-wreath, a sign ot virginity, at their weddings. ﻿And he also got what he deserved... ﻿Nine out of ten historical documents on this subject were written by men. ﻿Much has been told about female virgin cults, but little about male virginity. ﻿However, many prehistoric cultures worldwide ﻿had cults surrounding male virginjty. ﻿As the girl gained maturity through defloration. ﻿the boy was ritually circumcised to appease the demons. ﻿It was a custom in many places betore Moses made circumcision a law. ﻿Some Mato Grosso tribes had other reasons to have customs ﻿that protected the boys' penises before puberty. ﻿Mainly in those tribes where women ruled. The legend of the Amazons developed from the fact that in the Amazon region ﻿women had absolute power and men were lust objects, ﻿only needed for reproduction. ﻿Still today young men are protected and fattened until the age of 17 ﻿Surely any civilized male would like to trade places with this Amazon boy. ﻿When he reaches sexual maturity, the leader bestows manhood upon him ﻿and performs the circumcision ritual, ﻿using sharp metal blades on her teeth. ﻿She has done this many times before and surely won't hurt the boy. ﻿After all, the penis is very valuable for these women. ﻿He is now officially a man. ﻿If a boy becomes a man in an "unofficial" way, ﻿he is cast from the tribe and chased down to the great Amazon river. ﻿If he tried to return to his tribe, he would be horribally punished. The ethics of Islam are based on Judaism and Christianity and they differ little. ﻿They can only be acknowledged in comparison with the social norms ﻿of heathen Arab culture. ﻿Moderation and severity ﻿were invoked by the prohibition of wine and gambling. Nonetheless Islam rejecsts asceticism, ﻿supports certain pleasures of life, and detests celibacy . ﻿Polygamy, though, is limited to four lawful wives. ﻿Over time this rule was abandoned in some areas, and harems came into being, ﻿less due to a loosening of morals ﻿than to the influence of other cultures that converted to Islam. ﻿In parts of Arabia relative of the groom ﻿examined the bride before her wedding. ﻿In some areas of Central America girls of noble descent ﻿deflowered themselves in front of laudable warriors and chiefs. ﻿That's it for today. Just one more thing. When we develop system or theories, ﻿they should never change our convictions. ﻿The cult of virginity ﻿is long forgotten in modern societies. ﻿How many modern societies are there? ﻿And how many modern thinking people? ﻿Think about it. ﻿Good-bye. ﻿Is the experience of defloration still valued? ﻿It was disappointing. -Nice guy, it was fun. It ﻿had to happen sometime. ﻿Did you feel guilty? -No, it was just unpleasant. ﻿Are you ashamed you're not a virgin? -No. ﻿What an indiscrete question! ﻿Translation: Tommy Mang/Betty Huffman Holland Subtitling
