Beauty and the Beast Cinderella Snow White The Prince and the Wizard "Beauty and the Beast" In fairytales, the spell is broken and people live happily ever after. As for me, once the spell is broken, I would just become an ordinary 30-year-old guy Or so I thought But... Did you know that 30 years of virginity can make you a wizard? Good morning to my 30s Here he is! Double mayo guy! Are you okay? Oh... no problem. We're so close! Huh? What a lucky morning! My heart is throbbing like crazy. My heart beat... Hope Adachi hasn't noticed. What? Yuichi Kurosawa. We award you! He's the ace of the team with top sales 5 years in a row. The boss and the girls adore him. The best and most refreshingly handsome man. We have nothing in common except our age and sex. Hi. Why would a guy like Kurosawa be interested in me? You can read people's minds because you're 30 and still a virgin. That's how you happen to know your colleague likes you. I like you. I'll gladly be his colleague, as long as I can stay by his side. Forgive me... for loving you. But… I'd rather... do something about it than do nothing at all. Everything about him. Everything. Every single thing. I can't let go! I... I like you. We're together now, because... you read my mind. Please... Stay with me forever. I will. I guess I'm still in the middle of a fairytale. Christmas Eve Rokkaku? Yuta Rokkaku It could be work. Excuse me. What's the matter? Huh? Kurosawa-san? Sorry, I got the wrong number! Sorry. Should I make something? Chicken noodles? Sounds nice. I love it. Here you go. This is the real thing. Let's eat. Please do. Mm, awesome! Glad you like it. Sigh... what terrible timing! But now that Adachi and I are together... we're gonna take it nice and slow. - Wanna go back to bed. - I'm so nervous. - I drank too much. - I blew it. Can't wait till lunch. Let's go out this weekend. Good morning. He's getting the hang of it. I'm… still a wizard. Cherry Magic: THE MOVIE 30 Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?! -Is this it? -Yeah! You got a hit. -That's it. - I got it Pull it up - Ready? - 1, 2... That's it. Steady - Okay - I did it! Hooray! Didn't know trouts looked so cute. He's so cute when he's all excited! Wow... Welcome back. Here. Thanks. Are you okay? I'm okay. Good. Now then. Can't wait. Me neither. A stick! -Good idea. -Yeah. You okay? Yep. Feels good. Sure does. It's beautiful. I love your smile, Adachi. Hey, Adachi. The materials you put together were tremendously useful. Thank you. -I'm counting on you. -Okay. Chief, we're going out. Go ahead. Rokkaku, let's go! Yes, sir. -Wait up, Kurosawa-san. -Hm? Your materials? -I got it. -Good. Mm, awesome! Glad you like it. I made it for the first time, so I'm not very confident Are you kidding? It's superb. Thanks. It's time! 5, 4, 3, 2,1... Happy New Year! What did you wish for? You go first. For us to be together forever. Your turn. I wished for our happy days to last forever. Happy New Year. Best wishes. You, too. To another good year. Another good year. How's your new book? Working on it. How's Rokkaku doing? He's doing great, working hard. And you, Minato? Got a job as a backup dancer. Isn't that awesome! Congratulations. Thanks. -Wow! -It's nothing. Tsuge, I never knew you smiled like that. Hey! Wipe that smirk off your face! I said, stop it. By the way, I don't see any sweet rice drink stalls this year. I know, it's too bad. What's a New Year without them? I know, right? Right? What's wrong? Tell me. I won't understand unless you put it into words. You were flirting with Adachi-san. Flirting? Hey, are you jealous? No! Where do you wanna go? We'll go see blossoms in spring. Festivals in summer. Let's go out for beers! Well go to concerts and art museums in autumn. How about a trip together? To Hakodate or Kyoto? How I wish... truly wish... that our time would last forever. A job transfer for me? That's right. What would you say about... going to Nagasaki? Our motto is "To bring a little richness in life"... with our stationery. We've also started handling household goods. We're about to expand our sales channel to Kyushu. How wonderful. Where will the branch be? In Nagasaki. Nagasaki? That's right. For 8 months. 8 months? It'll be our second branch in Kyushu since Fukuoka. We consider it to be an important base to expand our sales channel. But... Why did you pick me for such an important task? Because you're cut out for the job. You've been doing well. My first chance ever to step up in my career. "Payroll System" "Housing Allowance" What? I get a raise and a housing allowance? How good can it get? But wait… Kurosawa and I will be far apart. Where do you wanna go? We'll go see blossoms in spring. Festivals in summer. Let's go out for beers, too! Kurosawa will be devastated when he finds out. No, he wouldn't. I'm sure he'll support me when I tell him. Kurosawa always puts me before himself I don't wanna leave him out and see him sad again. Hey, Adachi. Yes, sir? Heard about Nagasaki. Oh. About that... Be happy. It's a promotion, right? Lucky bastard. Urabe-san. Please listen. Good morning. Hi. You look terrible. Are you okay? Got a hangover because of Adachi. He wanted my advice. What about? Heard about our new branch in Nagasaki? Y... yes, I have. Adachi has been appointed manager there. Is that so? Yeah, isn't that great? But somehow, he seemed really troubled. He's always been interested in field work. He's single, so I told him there's nothing to think about. But I'm afraid he'll decline. Decline? What a waste. Kurosawa? I'm coming. Did you wait? Not at all. Let's go. Geez, I'm starving. Wanna grab a bite? Sure. Where do you wanna go? Adachi. I heard about your transfer to Nagasaki. Urabe-san told me. Is it true you're gonna reject it? Yeah, I'm not cut out for the job anyway. But managing a new branch is such an opportunity. I know that. But… I'll support you. I'm sure you'll do just fine. We can still see each other. Okay? Well... I guess so. Let's go home. Are you really happy for me? Adachi, don't you believe what I just told you? It's not... Whatever makes you happy, makes me happy. I know. Good morning. Morning. I've been doing a lot of thinking, and… "Adachi: I've decided to accept the offer." "Kurosawa: You'll do just fine! I support you." So, you've made up your mind to go to Nagasaki. Yes, sir. I decided to go to Nagasaki because I believed in Kurosawa's words. I wanted him to know that You're gonna get busy. Good luck. I'll do my best. Let's go, Kurosawa-san. We're off. Bye. But I can't help but wonder. Did I make the right decision coming here? The thought kept nagging me. Mr. Adachi? I'm sorry. The site is 660 square meters. So we need to come up with a different product launch from Tokyo. You're right. Listen up. Mr. Kiyoshi Adachi here will be joining us for our project. I'm Adachi from the Tokyo Head Office. Nice to meet you. Welcome. What? Would you please hold on? Mr. Kusumoto, the wallpaper we ordered won't make it on time. I'll ask a local company if they have a similar color. Thank you. 2 weeks in Nagasaki. The work here is challenging. -Thanks for coming. -We appreciate it. Thank you. Good presentation. Thank you, sir. They say the Nagasaki branch is doing well. Let's do the same. Yes, sir. -Good job. -Thanks, sir. I'm tired. "Kurosawa: Finish work? You must be tired." "Adachi: I'm great! Thanks for asking!" "Kurosawa: Don't force yourself too much, okay?" That day... I was afraid. Afraid I might be a burden to him. That's why I backed out and said I support him. I have no idea what Kurosawa is thinking. "Kurosawa: Great! Good luck tomorrow!" There's no way of knowing because I can't read his mind. I'm trying to read his mind again! I haven't changed a bit "February 19th, 2022, Flight ticket from Nagasaki to Tokyo" "Reservation" Completed Done. Oh no! I got it. Okay. "Toyokawa Company, Tokyo Head Office" I have to take this. That's weird... Kurosawa-san! Bad news! Adachi-san got into an accident. An accident? That's right. We just received a call. The Nagasaki branch is confirming the details. The number you have called is not available. due to bad reception or disconnection. The number you have called is not available... due to bad reception... Kurosawa! Kurosawa? Kurosawa! Don't go! Kurosawa! Kurosawa... How are you feeling? Catch up on your sleep? You lost consciousness and fell asleep. Gosh, I didn't realize... Too bad about your smartphone. Your company has contacted your family. Thank you. Bye. Gotta call Kurosawa. I don't remember his number. Adachi? Kurosawa... Are you okay? wasn't okay. I wasn't okay at all. When I heard you were in an accident... I nearly lost it. I'm so glad you're safe. Me, neither. I wasn't okay. I know. You were tired and fainted. It's not that. I regretted not sharing my true feelings with you. I thought I'd never see you again. So... I promised myself... to speak up and tell you the next time I saw you. When I was offered this post... I guess I was really happy. But then... I thought of your feelings and the many plans you had for us. I knew I wanted to cherish your smile To me, that's what matters more than anything in the world. But... I should've asked you to tell me how you felt in your own words. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. When you didn't turn to me... I was sad. The thought of you leaving... made me sad. Sorry. I'm such a mess. Kurosawa. How can I make him feel all the love I have for him? Adachi... Good morning. Morning. Wow, they look fresh! Mom sent them to me but I never had time to cook. These are worth cooking. -Oh yeah? -Sure. Incredible. What should I make? Thank you. Let's dig in. Looks delicious. Oh no! You okay? Sorry. - Here. - Thanks. Sorry, it was too hot. What is it? I can't hear it. Hear what? I knew something was off. I can't hear the voice in your mind. I've lost my magic. Really? Yeah. How about this? Nothing. And this? Nothing. And this? Nothing. And this? Nothing... It's really gone. Do you regret it? I'm fine with it. As long as I have you. This is nice. Spending time with you like this is really nice. Totally. Let's live together when you come back. Stay with me. Forever. I will. The shop in Nagasaki opened. From Adachi. Adachi-san. He looks all serious. That's his nervous face. "I've decided to live with Kurosawa when I get back." -I'll be on my way. -What? But you just came. We hadn't seen each other in a while. "Writers need personal space." So they say. When I told my friend you're in a slump, that's the advice he gave me. But that's not... You know I want you to be a great writer, don't you? Good luck. Welcome! -Welcome. -Thank you for coming. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome. Welcome. Sorry to keep you waiting. I was picking out souvenirs. So many people you care about. -There's room in the back. -Thanks. Mr. Kusumoto. Thank you. No, we should be thanking you. I pushed you too hard. Not at all. Let's go. What time's your flight? It's 12:30. -12:30? -That's right. It's so pretty! Blow and it'll make a sound. You did a good job in Nagasaki. I'm back from tomorrow onward. See you then. Thanks. Welcome back. Thank you. It's a souvenir. -Thanks. -Here you are. Adachi-san! Welcome back! Good to be back. Thanks, Rokkaku. When I got into the accident, you contacted everyone for me, right? I appreciate it. Here. Oh, you didn't have to. It was nothing really. I went through hell while you were gone. Hello, sir. What happened? He's constantly fighting with his wife. She goes on about how I should have dinner at home and to bathe properly. Why is she so harsh on me? She makes such a fuss about nothing. And all the while, I think dearly of Yumi. Maybe she does, too. There are lots of ways to express one's affections. A harsh word could be her way of expressing her love for you. I get it. You're right. We made a vow, "In sickness and in health." I'll go call Yumi. That's love. We don't need magic. We can speak our minds and tell them how we feel... with our own words. -Okay. -There Thanks Are you okay with my place? I've always wanted to be surrounded by your things. Hey! I remember this. The one that fit me perfectly. When I imagined how good you'd look in it, I just had to get it. -I knew that. -Huh? Don't tell me you have more. Bring them all out Don't get me any more clothes, okay? You took a pic. -Just now. -What? -Delete it. -No. -Come on. -No way. Just delete it. Stop that. Way too many. It's nice to have a shopping district nearby. Sure is. The Makoto Rice Balls. -You like that shop. -Sure do. Especially double mayo. -Good, huh? -Totally. We're home. -I'll take that. -Thanks. "To Mr. Kiyoshi Adachi" "To Mr. Yuichi Kurosawa" There's a postcard for you. Thanks. Kurosawa: Making dinner Cleaning Bathtub cleaning Ironing Adachi: Rice cooking Washing up Putting out trash Toilet cleaning Paper shredding Good morning. Morning. Go wash your face. He isn't a morning person. It's too cute I can't eat it. Just eat it. I can't I'll eat it. No way. We'll be late. Give me 10 seconds. What are you doing? Imprinting it in my mind. -Chief's speech seemed like forever. -I know. -We need to rewrite this. -We'll get it done. Oh, Adachi-san? Working late? I have some papers to finish today. You're pumped up these days. I'm working towards a goal. Wow, you have a goal now. Your goal is to become "Kurosawa the Second" right? No! "Rokkaku the First." Kurosawa-san told me I have my own advantages. Wow, that's nice. I'm not thinking of marrying yet, so I'm free to bury myself in work. I'm enjoying it. And you, Fujisaki-san? I'm enjoying it, too. I love doing something I'm devoted to, and there's lots to learn on the way. If I can see my friends once in a while and enjoy a chat, I'd be happy. Sounds nice. Just as long as I'm satisfied with my own life. That would make me happy. You're right. Let's do our best. Here's a toast to Adachi and Kurosawa. May your lives together be happy. Cheers! I'll go fry onion rings. You're making more? It's best just fried. I'll help you, just so I can have the freshest one. Thanks. Dig in. I'm happy for you. Congratulations. Thanks. But I never thought the both of you would live in this old apartment. Me, neither. Like this? That's perfect. You're such a good cook. Tsuge. Have you thought of your future together with Minato? Well... -That's amazing! -Far from it. I don't know about the future but I want to stay by his side. And you? Listen. What were you talking about? The future. Minato. Would you like to come live with me? "Writers need personal space to create great works." So they say. I thought that might be true. But... you made me realize. That's just bullshit. No matter how much slump I'm in, that's my problem. It has nothing to do with space. I can be happy and be able to write. No... I know I can write better when you're around. Besides... I keep missing you every time we say good bye. My point is... I like you very much, and I need you, Minato. Stay with me. Okay. I'll live with you. It's been a while since we had a dinner party like this. You've been busy recently. I guess. Chief says you've been working extremely hard since you've come back. -You see... -Hm? I have to be needed at work. So we won't be separated unfairly when our company finds out about us. Until recently... I was happy just being with you. But now... I want to have a life with you forever and for always. I want to let the people I care about know that. And the people you care about too, Kurosawa. When I got into that accident... the company and my family were notified. But not the one I care about the most. That almost drove me insane. And then I thought... if you were to be in an accident... I wouldn't be told as long as we stay as we are. That's why... I need to let everyone know... that you're precious to me. For us. Kurosawa. Let's do it. The ones we care about. We'll tell them about our relationship. For us. Let's. "Resume: Yuichi Kurosawa" What's this? If I'm meeting your folks... they'd wanna know my background and selling points. And, my reason for applying... is here. Sounds like a presentation. What do you think? So far, pretty weird. "Yuichi Kurosawa, 31. Born on July 3rd." "Raised in Yokosuka City, Kanagawa." "Family members are father, mother, and sister." How's your sister? She's doing great. She's gone abroad with her boyfriend. -Just your parents then. -Yep. You have a brother, right? That's right. He's married and lives with my parents. Has a daughter, too. Sounds fun and lively. It's actually more like noisy. -Wanna ride the merry-go-round? -Sure! We're off now. See you. Lefs go. Off you go. Honey, Kiyoshi says he's coming home next week. He wants us to meet someone. Sorry to bother you. I forgot to pack Kiko's clothes, sorry. Just a moment, wait right there. I see. I'm nervous. So am I. I've never introduced anyone to my folks. Nice to meet you. My name is Yuichi Kurosawa and I'm Kiyoshi's colleague at work. Please accept this. - Oh... - You're welcome. Thank you. Here. Take this. -Here you are. -Thanks. Sit down properly. Help yourself. They're the sweets you brought us. I appreciate it. Thank you. Please. It's good. I'm glad. Let me. Though you've only met me for the first time today... you've welcomed me warmly. I thank you. I, Yuichi Kurosawa... and Kiyoshi... have been dating since last year. I want to share my life and have a future with him. If I may. We want to be happy together, Kiyoshi and I. Please. Give us your blessings. Kiyoshi. Yes. You've always been honest with yourself. So, you must've made up your mind. I have. Fine. Fine? What do you mean? Are you okay with it? That doesn't matter. He's the one you chose. Of course it's okay. Right, honey? Sure... Congratulations. Congratulations, Kiyoshi. Congrats, bro. Congratulations. Thank you. Yuichi. Yes, ma'am. Welcome to our family. I appreciate it. Let's prepare dinner. Okay, let's get moving now. Mr. Kurosawa. Can you play Japanese chess? That's it. Sprinkle a little more. Thank you for understanding. I really appreciate it. But... can I ask why? There are so many choices to make. You're right. Life is full of choices. Excuse me? A choice made with strong determination. That's something noble. I'm grateful to you for choosing my son, Kiyoshi. I'm happy now that I have someone to play Japanese chess with. Because Kiyoshi's a poor player. I appreciate it. It's your turn, Yuichi. Yes, sir. Thank you. Kiko, be patient. Oh, thanks. Thank you. -Say thank you. -Thank you. How old is she now? 5 years old. Don't mind if I do. Do you drink? Not so much. I just drink socially. Lucky you, now you have a drinking buddy. Good for you, Kiko. Potato salad? I'll have some. Pass it on. It's delicious. Stop kidding around, honey. Eat this, too. You really should. Isn't that right? I'm happy. Me, too. “Father” Hello, Father. Hello. It's about your coming home this weekend. There's someone you want us to meet? That's right. To tell you the truth, your mother's still a bit hesitant. I see. I'll think of something. Mm, awesome! Glad you like it. Do your folks like cake? I thought I'd take chestnut cakes with me this weekend. Good idea. Something wrong? Well, you don't seem yourself today. Lisfen, Adachi. About this weekend. I think I'll go home without you and talk to my folks alone. What? They don't approve of us? They knew about our relationship. But... I get it. You don't have to worry. I'll deal with it. -But... -I don't mind. If they disapprove, they can kick me out of the family. You can't let that happen. Those who are precious to you, are precious to me as well. Don't carry the pain alone. We're gonna be happy, right? Besides... even if they disapprove... I'm sure we'll come up with our own way of being happy together. You're strong. When you're weak, I'll be strong. And when I'm weak, I'd appreciate a helping hand from you. I wish we could always be there for one another. Here you go. Thanks. We still have time. "Father" Hello, Father? Yes. Your mother says she doesn't mind seeing him. Alright. We'll go visit this weekend then. Together. Mother. I'm home. Hello, dear. My name is Kiyoshi Adachi. Nice to meet you. I appreciate your precious time. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Here's a little something. I hope you like it. Thank you. Please, have a seat. Adachi. Thank you. Mr. Adachi. Yes, ma'am? I'm sorry for being indecisive and everything. Not at all. It's just... I'm… I'm worried. I'm afraid you might live to regret it some day. Both Yuichi and yourself. How can you be sure a day like that will never come? Can you be absolutely certain? But mother... To be honest, I can't say I'm absolutely certain. I don't have the confidence in me. I mean, I didn't have the confidence. Until I met Kurosawa. I'm… I'm a coward. I've never been confident. I've always been a loser and I'd give up from the start. Then one day... I met Kurosawa, and he gave me a reason to change. He gave me the courage to confront my fears... again and again. Right now, there's only one thing I can say I'm sure of. I... I love Kurosawa. As for me... ever since I was a child, people would judge me by my looks. It was so frustrating. I pretended to be strong, to be perfect. But then... I met Adachi. He accepted me as I am. He made me feel it's okay to be uncool and weak... for the first time. I know you don't approve of us right now. But... it's okay with you, we'll wait as long as it takes. We'll show you how happy we are... that we don't regret it. We'll tell you over and over again. Forever... and ever. Until you'll approve. Forever is a long time. I don't think we can wait that long. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not making any sense. Yuichi. You've changed. Yes. You changed him. I guess... um... I don't think I want this. Pardon? From next time. Families don't bring home souvenirs, do they? More happy people. More the merrier. I believe your lives are yours to live. Gosh, I got so shaky. Me, too. I panicked when my mother told you she didn't want the cake. I wish I had the magic to read her mind. I'm glad mine was already gone and couldn't read her mind. Why? Because if I still had my magic, I'd probably... look for the right words to please her, and couldn't be firm with her. You're right. Adachi. When you said you love me... you made my heart skip a beat. What did you say? When did you get these anyway? I had them ready for good luck, so today would turn out okay. By the way the size fits me perfectly, how come? I took the measurements while you were asleep. That's so you. In fairytales, the spell is broken and people live happily ever after. As for me, I would simply become an ordinary 30-year-old guy Or so I thought. But... I guess I was wrong. Adachi. The Prince and the Wizard Let's go. Let's.
