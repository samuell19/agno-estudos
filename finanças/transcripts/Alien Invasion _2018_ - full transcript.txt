Hey! - Hi! - Hello. Uh, Sara Hamilton? Yeah. That'd be me. Yeah, well, this package... ...is for you. Finally! I almost gave up waiting for it. Well, it's all yours, if I can just get you to sign right there. You're a godsend. If you hadn't turned up today, it would have been too late. I knew that. Why do you think I'm here now? There you go. - Thank you, and enjoy... - Thank you. ...whatever was so important. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Humanity has had the oddest habit of turning a blind eye to anything that makes it uneasy. In 1634, Galileo was declared a heretic for daring to suggest that it was, in fact, the Earth that revolved around the Sun and not the other way round. And even though this was one of the most strongly supported facts ever disclosed, that assertion cost him not only his reputation, but it also cut him off from society right up until the day he died. For centuries, thousands upon thousands of people have experienced UFO sightings and various forms of encounters with extraterrestrials. Even over 3,000 years ago, the Mayans depicted some of these occurrences in their wall carvings. But, of course, it wasn't until the advent of photography towards the end of the 19th century that we were able to actually record proof. Physical proof of these sightings. But that was never gonna be enough. What with our ingrained mockery and dupery, which gave way to incessant suspicion and dogma, which, of course, cast such an enormous shadow of doubt all over this proof. At least for those... - who chose to turn... - Hello? - ...a blind eye. - Hi, Sara. - It's just your mom calling. - Hi, Mom. - How are you? - I'm fine. Listen, the reason I'm calling is... I wondered if you may be free to come over for lunch tomorrow? Oh, are you serious? You know I can't. I'm going away, you know that. Sorry, love. Yes, you did tell me. I don't know why, I was certain that was next week. Oh, no, Mom. It's this weekend. Couldn't someone else from the office at least go with you to keep you company? Mom, can we not do this again? You know, this not work-related. This is for my book. I know, Sara. Mom, are you hearing yourself? We're not in the 20s anymore, okay? Women can travel around the world by themselves. You really need to accept that already. You watch your tone, young lady! This is your mother you're talking to. And you make it sound like I was around when dinosaurs ruled the earth. You are so like your father. Mom, please tell me you're not drinking again. 'Course not! Anyway... I wasn't gonna bring this up. But I was speaking to your aunt, and she said she read all kinds of weird stories about that place you're so intent on visiting. Oh, Mom, please. Well, you do whatever you think you should! I can least expect a call from you as soon as you get there, though, right? No, Mom. There's no signal in the forest, and I'm pretty sure there's no Wi-Fi, either. Okay? You know what? I'll... I'll call you as soon as I get home on Monday, okay? All right. Okay. But please promise me you'll be careful with the car. Oh, yes, Mom. Okay? I'll talk to you soon. All right. Bye. I love you. Look. "And four living creatures emerged from the center of the image. When the creatures moved, the wheels rolled along with them. And when the creatures floated above the land, the wheels also floated. Because the spirit of those creatures was in the wheels." Ezekiel, chapter one. So, as the prophet predicted, humanity found itself facing one of its greatest challenges to date. Having to acknowledge the existence of civilization from other parts of the galaxy. We can only hope that this time, unlike what happened with Galileo, we won't have to wait all of 300 years to authenticate the veracity of the unmitigated proof we will be providing today. That must be it. Excuse me. Um, um, I'm headed to the military barracks. Is this the right way? You'd think God might at least do something about our appearance, and that... damn foul smell when our souls finally abandon us, right? It's definitely not one of his stronger points. Twenty years on the force, and the smell doesn't get any kinder on the senses. I don't know how you do put up with it. No different to a deer or a boar. You say so. I just about had enough of it, Joe. This has got to be the only nature reserve in the world where the damn bears choose not to hibernate. What can I say... The unpredictable mysteries of nature. Yeah, well, a fucking truce over the winter would be doing everyone a favor, now, wouldn't it? Sure, but like I already said, the temperature affects their behavior. And besides, people know all well and good the danger they're putting themselves in by coming out here. There are warning signs at every entrance. Not to mention the permit you need before you're even allowed to step foot in this place. Yeah, fucking waste of time, if you ask me. I don't why you all get off on that red tape bullshit. Well... Looks like you've got your work cut out for you. You'd best get on with it. Yeah, I best had. Um... You'll have to excuse me. Call me or come find me whenever you want. Mi casa su casa, and all of that. Yeah, right. Moron! How many times I've got to tell you? No taking photos around me. Get the fuck outta here, now! It's okay, boss. It's okay. Jesus Christ! Oh, my god Oh, my god. You're Joe, right? Uh, yeah. You must be the journalist? Yeah. Something tells me you knew that before you scared the hell out of me, Ranger. "Sara Hamilton." - Yup, that'd be me. - Good. Well, it's great to see you've brought your permit and turned up on time. I wish everyone else would take a leaf out of your book. Yeah, well, I had no other choice. Some guy on the phone gave me strict instructions. Otherwise, there was no way I was getting in here. Yeah. Uh, that guy on the phone might have been me. Well, you can't be too careful, you know? Uh, sometimes people are too smart for their own good, and they only realize once it's too late. Yeah, I got you. We need to know when people are gonna be here, so we can be around to keep watch over you. Contrary to what most people believe, the biggest obstacle isn't getting in here. It's getting out... alive. Yeah. The bears? Exactly. Yeah. I saw the commotion on the river bank. Well, I hope the man upstairs doesn't give us any problems. I think we'll be okay. But we're gonna start inside, so... you don't have anything to worry about. Great! What do you say we do this already? I'll follow you. So, what do you think of this so far? It's amazing. Can't wait to get inside. Something tells me you're not gonna be disappointed. Humans need something to hold onto, you know? And when it's something you can't quite get your head round... ...you take your own ignorance as the truth. Well, that's a lovely philosophy, Joe. But there must have been documented cases of sightings and contact before what happened. Well, sure. But there's no actual proof of anything from the moment the barracks were built until they were abandoned. Official records, you mean? Well, yeah. I couldn't tell you about anything off the record. Although, I guess I gotta warn you, strange things still happen here now and again. Shit. What's going on? Okay, just keep quiet. What? Oh, my god. Okay, Sara just do exactly as I say. - Okay? - Okay. Now, on three, I want you to run out of the forest as fast as you can towards the barracks, as if your life depended on it. Wait. What about you? No, don't ask questions now, for god's sake, Sara. Okay? Just run. And no matter what you hear, don't look back. You hear me? - No looking back. - Okay. Okay. One... Two... Three. Run, Sara! Run! Fuck. Fuck, fuck! Help! Help! Come on! Come out here! You don't get the balls, do you? Couldn't you have picked a better time? Can't you see we've got guests? Come on! Come out here! Where the hell are you? You still haven't learned who makes the fucking rules around here, have you? Oh, god. Oh, god. Shit. Oh, my god! You're a - fucking savage bastard! - Joe! Joe! - Joe! Watch out, watch out! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jesus, what the fuck... Jesus, Ed! What? You know him? Yeah, of course, I do. Everybody does. It's Ed. Didn't I mention him earlier? No. No, you didn't. Oh. Well, he's as weird as they come, but... his heart is in the right place, isn't it, buddy? - Jesus, Joe! - Yeah. I caught it on the iron rails on the fence. We need to get you to a hospital! It's nothing. What... Yeah, all right. Whatever you say. Where's he going? Uh, he's got a first aid kit in his hut. He's gonna stitch it up for me. Come on! You're joking, right? No. It's not the first time, either. These sort of things happen all the time. Come on! He lives down there? No, of course not. He lives in a caravan in the forest, on the other side of the barracks. But if we go this way, we avoid having to deal with that friend of ours outside again. Yeah. And we're just gonna go down there, just like that? Come on. It'll be more fun this way. Yeah. You could say Ed's the real keeper of this castle. He scares prying eyes away. Even the damn bears are scared of him. But... What is he? Mute or something? Uh, not exactly. He's just... ...not the most talkative of people. But he's quite the erudite. You'll see. Here's where the officer's rooms were. And at the far end, Command and Captaincy offices. And why was there a nursery? Oh. Some of the higher officers lived here with their families. There were stories about how women became more fertile in this forest. It was a pretty productive time for some of them. Yeah. Come on. You're gonna like this. Ah, leave it out, will you? Let me show her. Come on. What's his problem now? Ah, nothing. He's just over meticulous is all. See? This was how they got to the higher floors. Up there was the library, the living room, and the bedrooms for the noncommissioned officers. And down there? Hell. That actually wouldn't surprise me. Yeah, well, the gateway at least. Dr. Marshall's molecular biology lab and the weapons tunnel were on the lower floors. And... if you stick your head in there for a few seconds, you can still hear the screams of the long-lost souls who were trapped down there. You're making fun of me, aren't you? You be the judge. Oh, my god, Joe. What the hell is that? I told you weird things still happen around here. Dude, what's really down there? 'Cause if you're not making this up, I'm leaving right now. Yeah, right, we're coming. Keep your hat on. He wants us to get a move on, but pay no attention. Well, true or not, it's probably not the best idea to be walking around here on your own. But I will put you out of your misery, and I will tell you what it is. Yeah, something that makes sense, please. I'm serious! And by the way, do you really understand everything that he says? Um... How do I explain this? Let me break it down. Have you ever had a dog? Yeah, when I was a kid. Chewie. He was part of the family. Okay. And even though Chewie, all he ever did was bark, you still understood everything he said, right? Yeah. Exactly! Well, imagine if you've had a chance to share a couple of beers with him. I'm sure your canine communication skills would have reached all new levels. Well, I never thought about it like that. That's what I was trying to say earlier. More often than not, the truth is actually a lot less complicated than it seems. You see, that's what I was getting at earlier when we talked about all those rumors that were flying around. Yeah. And... What about those cries we just heard? Exactly. What about those cries? That's just the sound of the north wind blowing through the ventilation ducts on the lower levels. Well, that scared the shit out of me. Imagination can be a man's worst friend. Isn't that right, Ed? Time to visit the underworld, then? Uh, not yet. This is an exit that leads directly outside. The Tetis Region was one of the hot spots where various UFO activity was witnessed, following the Cosmic Call as a result of the power burst caused by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. One of the most bizarre UFO occurrences ever recorded took place right here. On October 15th, 1946, a manned alien ship crashed in the rocky mountain range you can see behind me. The military swiftly moved in, a 25-kilometer radius extending from the crash site was declared off-limits to civilians. It was impossible to gain access to this forest for the four decades that the now abandoned military reserve was operating. But, on that October evening, before the military even arrived on the scene, a local witnessed the event, and he took a photograph. That photograph was published in the media, which caused the government to launch a relentless campaign rejecting and debunking the proof. Now, in the photograph taken by the civilian, we can see the image of the flying saucer and two human-shaped figures lying on the ground whose body measurements deviate considerably from the human norm. The official version attributed the event to a military jet, which crashed during training, caused by rotational energy. Accordingly, society mourned the death of these two pilots, whose charred cadavers were said to have been retrieved near the fuselage. Hmm. So, what became of this third figure? When they wake up after the winter lethargy, they have one hell of an appetite and are seriously sexually active. It's their mating season, so they turn aggressive because of how few females there are. And why are there so few females? I guess we'll have to ask the man upstairs. The thing is, they think they're the fucking kings of the jungle, you know? No respect for us humans. Sara? Come over to me. It's okay. Come over here. Ed? Your friend's back. Okay, okay. Follow, Ed, okay? It's gonna be okay, I swear. Okay. Go, Sara, go! You heard the boss complaining, didn't you, you bastard? Huh? Well, you're gonna be in trouble if he finds out. You're done for, you hear me? You're done for! You think he's gonna be okay? Oh, my... Oh, my god, Joe. I thought you weren't coming back. I'm okay. Don't worry. Okay. Now this... this they do show little respect to. I think it's run off home. Ed! You can get your sewing kit out now, buddy. Where are you going now? Jesus, Ed. Leave it! Ed, I know what you're like, and you'll both get hurt. Hey! Okay, do it your way, yeah? Same as always! Yeah, you can do all the explaining later, huh? - Is he going to kill it? - No. Well, at least I hope not. He's gonna teach it a lesson in his own particular way. Shouldn't you go with him? Well... Oh. No hurry. Do you want me to help you with... Mmm, no. It's okay. Thanks. Um, I can probably do a brushing up of my sewing skills after last time. Joe, can I take... a look? Yeah, yeah, of course. While the cat's away. I mean, Ed doesn't really like people meddling with his stuff. You said, Dr. Marshal was in charge of the lab, right? Yep, he was. And... ...he was Ed's dad. He was what now? Yeah. You heard me. Ed was born and bred in these here woods. He's oblivious to the world outside the forest. Hence, his... ...kindred relationship with the wildlife. Everyone just assumed he disappeared in the explosion that... ...killed his parents and destroyed the military barracks. But he was hiding in the woods, and grew up living like a caveman. But what about his family? Didn't he have uncles or grandparents? Someone? Yeah. I guess there must've been someone, but this was the only world he knew. That's the embroidery done. Yeah. I guess he just didn't wanna leave his memories behind, you know? And he probably felt it was his responsibility to carry on his dad's work. Can I take a look? You're a reporter with a scientific bent, too? Yeah, of course. No secrets here. At least until Ed gets back anyway. Uh... Stay here and don't worry. I'll be right back. Ed? Ed? Where the hell are you, buddy? Hello? Fuck. Fuck, fuck. What the fuck is that? Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Show, motherfuck! Sara? Sara? Sara? Sara, wake up. Come on! Sara, can you hear me? Have some water. It'll help. Oh! Thank you. I couldn't find you anywhere. What? Uh, I walked past here like ten minutes ago and you weren't here. I don't know where you were. What I'm saying is, I think we've just experienced an encounter... - of the fourth fucking kind. - Fuck. Do you know what that means? An abduction! Oh! Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. - What is it? - Oh, my god. I don't know. Oh, that hurts! - Oh! - Joe. What the fuck is this? - Oh, my... - Oh, my... Oh, my god. Oh, my... I'm gonna try again. Zenith to Base, do you copy? Zenith to Base, do you copy? Fuck! Fuck! Fucking technology! I've tried, like, 20 times and nothing. It's fried. What happened to Ed? I don't know. I lost track of him after the gunshots. I can't remember anything else. I woke up back over there. And, Sara... there's a mark on my ankle, too. You too! We've got to get out of here, we're way too exposed. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. - I know somewhere safer. - Okay. Wait! Wait, wait. Where's my camera? Where's my camera? I got it, I got it, I got it. Hey. We've gotta go back to the barracks. Okay. It's okay. Come on. Okay. Just rest here. Okay. Okay. Just try and relax, and wait for me here, okay? Joe. I'm gonna go check it out first. Please, please be careful, please? Hey. It's okay. Yeah? I'll be literally two minutes. Fuck. The fuck have you done to me? Must have dropped it. Hello? Hello? Shit. Fuck. All right, here we are again. I know. On the way. I hate these bumps. I hate that there's bumps in the middle of the road. Some people like you will slow down. - I always slow down. - Yeah, I know. I just think that we take things for granted. You know, it's as if people think they're gonna live forever, but that's not the case. - What? - I mean, things can end at any moment. And take us, for example. I mean, there's a purpose for why we're in this car. Yeah, of course, there's a reason. We went to the same school together. Oh, stop being a shithead, Will. I mean, I read about this in one of those self-help books, and it says that it's nothing but a simple countdown. You read way too much. Every day wasted is like a slap in the face - to your dreams. - What... Hello? What's going on? It is, and while there's no predicting it, our time here can run out when least expected. Bullshit, woman! What do you mean "bullshit"? Do you know where my dreams start and end? Where? On the sofa. Watching a game of football and sipping an ice-cold beer. - Hm. - And I can tell right now, that's something I'll never be late for. Ah, you're hopeless. Hello... Hello? - What's that? - Can anybody hear me? Oh, fuck! Again. ...encounter near the old barracks. Help me! Someone just help me, please! Help! - Joe! - Looks like those damned bears have gone too far this time. Well, they don't seem too concerned about it. They have the department. Well, if it's up to me, I'd sort that shit out right away. Base, this is 03, do you read me? We have a possible code 86 out by the old barracks. Repeat. Possible code 86. How shall we proceed? Over. You know what? Let's just head over there. That's good. Yeah. I'll enjoy catching that cuddly toy. And when I do, I'll blow its brains out. Base, this is 03, awaiting instructions. Do you read me? Affirmative 03. Old barracks and surrounding area, off-limits. Please proceed with your normal route. Over and out. Copy that, base. Standing down. What? We will proceed with the normal route. You know, like I said, it's like they don't give a shit. Well, I... I don't... I don't know if we should continue. What? If we don't go, they'll just turn up when it's too late. Like they always do. Hey, you know I'm always careful. Joe! Joe! Whoa, whoa, whoa... - Don't leave me alone. - It's okay. - Don't leave me alone. - It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Yeah? I'm sorry, I just wanted to find something, but... Let's go. Come on. You can come with me. It's okay. It tried to attack me, Joe. Where are we going? Into hell, Sara. This time, for real. Are you sure we're safer in there? I think so. That son of a bitch is back. Come on, quickly. Can you manage? Yeah. Yeah. But I don't know where I'm going. - Shit. Shit! - What? Joe! Joe! - Motherfucker. I'm... - Joe! Joe... Joe! What the fuck is going on? Joe! Please! Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's me. It's okay. Hey... Hey, don't worry. We're gonna be okay. Yeah? Okay. Oh! We're gonna keep going. Come on. I don't know about this, Joe. Sara, come on. Trust me. It's gonna be okay. That was not a fucking bear, Joe. No. That was not a fucking bear. Come on. Do you hear those cries? Yeah. I think they're coming from over there. Yeah. Well, that's the direction we're headed in. - Okay. - The north tunnel runs directly to the vehicle entrance. Hey. Over there. Where? Behind those bushes. Don't you see it? Will, I don't see anything. Don't worry, Sam. Leave me to deal with this. All right? I bet that son of a bitch is about to catch that girl. Will, I think we should call for backup. How the fuck are we gonna call for backup now? Huh? That's the last thing we can do... You brought me here, right? - I know, but... - Yeah. Well, let me finish what we started, then. Will, this is crazy. We should call for backup. This is all wrong. Base, this is 03. Do you read me? Base, this is 03. Do you read me? Requesting backup for a code 86. Receiving you, 03. Stay in the vehicle. You should have proceeded with your normal route. We're sending backup. Over. Hey. Where are you? Huh? I know you're there. You wanna piece of me, don't you? Huh? Come on! Son of a bitch! I know you're there. Hey! What? Where the fuck are you? Huh? Come on. Come on! I know you're there. Help! Fuck! What the fuck is that? You wanna piece of me, don't you? Eh? Ahh! Oh, my god. Will! Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. What's wrong with me? Hey, don't worry. It's probably just nerves. I'm sorry, Sara, but we've gotta keep moving. I know. I know. I'm okay. Let's go. Joe. That's Ed? No. - Oh, my... - It can't be. I knew... I knew there was something wrong with him when I saw him. I knew it. There's no way, Sara. There has to be an explanation. Then why aren't you shouting and running over to him? Because I can't be so sure now, either. Men are so clueless sometimes. That's the fucking thing that attacked me, Joe. - Oh, my god! - Run, Sara. Run! Oh, my god, Joe! What the fuck was that? No! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. It's okay. It's okay. - Sorry, I can't help... - It's okay. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. We're safe. We're safe. You can. You can. We're gonna be okay, yeah? I'm gonna get us out of here. We're gonna get out of here. Yeah? Yeah. What? Will! God! And the images we're about to see will prove, without a shadow of doubt, the types of experiments the depraved Doctor Marshall and his wife performed down here in the depths of the military base. Although, I'm sure you're probably asking yourselves, "What happened to that sole alien survivor?" With not a shred of physical proof suggesting the fact that it even existed. Maybe it was simply just destroyed in the explosion that killed the doctor, and virtually, every one of the soldiers housed at the barracks. - Fucking psychopath. - Maybe it was. Yes. Just as, maybe, on the afternoon of April 30th, 1946, Magda Goebbels convinced Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun to fake their deaths and flee to South America. At this point, it's up to you what to believe and what not to. Each to their own. What the fuck is all this shit, Joe? Sara. Sara, come on. Come on. I think it's gone. What... Can anybody explain any of this, Joe? How the hell am I supposed to know what goes on down there, Sara? Come on, Come on. - Hey, look, it's just... Hey. - No, I can't. - Take my hand. Take my hand. - No, I can't. - Hey. Yeah, you can. You can. - No, I can't. It's gonna be okay. Yeah? It's gonna be okay. Come on. On three, we move. Okay? One. Two. Three. Go! Go! Run! Joe! What are you doing? I'm sorry, Sara. I'm sorry. You can't leave me here! I'll come back for you. I promise I'll come back. Whatever happens, just... just know I'm sorry. Ed? It's dead! You hear me? - Joe! - I'm gonna finish it - for good this time. - Joe, are you okay? Oh, my god. What have they done to you? What have they done to you? No. No. No! No! No! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh. Get out of the way, you good-for-nothing half-wit. Oh, my pretty. Hold her for me, son. Oh, shut up, whore! You wet yourself? I'm sick and tired of these damned hysterical girls you keep bringing in, Ed. Eh! Eh, stop your squealing like a little pig! Now... Looking good. Goddamnit. Oh. This is gonna boost your fertility and make a real woman out of you. Ed, that's... Ah! You're gonna enjoy this. Just like I did when I was about your age. You can let her go now. And let him know! Now, that's more like it. Teamwork and coordination. Your daddy would be proud. Help me up. That's it. Now, uh... You stay here and watch over them. And don't you be touching yourself. Then come and help me. I'm gonna check on the other two. Joe... Joe. Joe! Joe! Thank you. So... You must be Sara. Yeah... Yeah. You're the... That's right. I'm Mrs. Marshall. Ed's mom. Anything I can help you with there? Uh... Uh, mm... Maybe, I... I... Have you seen the ranger? Joe? Well, um... I don't, I don't know how to explain this to you, but, um... We were outside, and... and a bear attacked us. Hm. There are no bears in my garden, little lady. I would have thought you would have been smart enough to figure that one out by now. I... I don't... I don't know what you're talking about. Joe! Joe! Ah, fuck. What the fuck is... Huh... This is coming along very nicely, dear. Oh, it's a little girl. Just like its mama. What the fuck are you doing to me? Now, now, Sara. Don't be ungrateful. Honestly, didn't they teach you any manners at school? Let me go, you fucking psychopath! Motherfucker... We have spent the last three decades trying to successfully breed a hybrid female. And at last, it looks like we found the right formula. If only the doctor could be here to witness it. He'd be so proud that we'll be bringing two little girls into the world. That's not happening. Crazy bitch. Hope you burn in hell. Joe! Joe! Sara, run. Run and don't look back! Where the hell are you? Get out of this hellhole, please. Sorry, Sara. Please forgive me. I'm not leaving without you, Joe! Sara, do not come in here. What the fuck is going on? Completing what God started. Son of a bitch! You can speak. We can all speak here, sweetie. I'm sorry, Sara. You're a hybrid. Just like your daughter. We are family now, Sara. Just accept it! No! If my findings are right, Dr. Marshall had three sons. Two of which we have seen running around the lab as kids. The chubby one and the one with the mark on his face. While the identity of the third child is... unknown, it would seem safe to assume that if-- Help! Help! Help! Okay. All right. All right. Okay. All right. Are you okay... All right. Calm down. Look. Look. You can go to my car but I have to get to work. I gotta keep my camera... Okay. It's okay. I'll be right there. All right. Okay. We'll get you somewhere... ...somewhere safe. Some warm food. Look, I told you it's gonna be okay, okay? Yeah. So, uh... Did you see the first episode of the documentary, then? - Yeah. - Yeah. What did you make of it? Great. Yeah. Good. 'Cause I've loved playing with cameras ever since. Ever since I can remember. Any day now, I see. You think? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, it's a... It's amazing how fast they, they grow nowadays. Well, you'll find out. Oh, let me guess. Um... He told you that you had been abducted, right? By aliens, no? Yeah! Of course, he did! Yeah, 'cause, man, he's one fucking nasty piece of work, that fucking guy. He's a... ...a fucking goddamn hybrid! Yeah. Yeah. Now, with mother fucking helping on... on... on boosting fertility. Ooh! He has his way with everything and anything that wanders out into our little, whoo... neck of the woods. I mean, just think about it. If we actually manage to engender a, a female hybrid. Oh, god! I shudder to think what's next. A new species, Mama says. Yeah. Yeah. "'Cause that was your father's dream! Yeah, that was your father's dream." Yeah, but that's the fucking problem, you see? That's the fucking problem! Everybody is so fucking wrapped up in their own fucking dreams, right? And I'm telling you, you have to be careful, you have to... you have to... you need to be careful with what you wish for. Because if it comes true, and then you find out that it's not what you actually wanted, and then, you're fucked. Then you're fucked. That's it. It's over. And then, then what? Huh? Then what? Then... There's no turning back. That's it. That's it. End of the story. I mean, fucking goddamn hybrid! Can you, can you imagine that? Oh, god. They'd be worse than fucking humans, man. And the humans are fucking bad enough as it is. Don't you think? Huh? I mean, how can anybody, in their right mind, think that the fucking extraterrestrials even wanna fucking come back? Do they really think they're that fucking stupid? Huh? And what the fuck would they be interested in discovering out here in our little piece of shit corner of the galaxy, populated by nothing, but a... worthless, miserable, selfish, fucking pathetic species? Did you see what I'm saying? Did you see what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. You get it, don't you? "Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not... bear false witness against thy neighbor. Thou shalt not... covet thy neighbor's wife." Not their ass, their dwelling, nor their ox. "Thou shalt not kill." What is that? "Thou shalt..." "Thou shalt not kill." What the fuck? Yeah. Oh, god. Yeah. You must have been out to fucking lunch the day you left your fucking underlings in charge, to come up with us. To create us fucking human beings. And they used all the fucking shit that they could find around up there. And it's fucking in us. It's fucking in us. Oh, god. Ah, fucking humans. Oh, they are the fucking worst. The fucking worst. Okay. All of it, it's just... a matter of time now. Oh, just a silly little fucking waiting game. I'm sorry I didn't... I didn't mean to yell. It's okay. We're the good ones, okay? All right? It's gonna be okay. We're gonna get you home. Okay? All right? So, don't worry. All right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. Hey, be more careful! Jesus... Christ! No trace of Sam, sir. Then he's probably taking her back to his lair. Help! Help! What the fuck? Hey, calm down. Calm down. Don't worry. Don't worry. Hey. All right. What's eating you, little lady? Those fucking bears? No. Please. - Please. Please. - Don't worry. You're safe. Look at me. You're safe now. Put her in the car. And you give her something to calm her down. Now. What the hell is going on here? You still not finished with that documentary, or what? Yeah. Uh, no. I'm working on a sequel, so, um... I guess, no. Um... But, I, I don't know what happened, Inspector. I... I saw her over on the other side, and, you know, she was running away from the barracks. So what the hell happened to her? I don't know. I think she's a little crazy, Inspector. She was going on and on about... about an abduction and a woman in a white nurse's uniform. She's too Cuckoo. Did you not see Joe up there? Speaking of the devil, there he is! Can you wait for me in the car, asswipe? Yeah, well, I can't wait to hear what kinda cockamamie bullshit stories-- Get the fuck out of here! - I'm really sorry. - You're sorry? What the fuck happened here, Joe? I mean, can somebody, please, tell me what the hell is going on? I've got an agent mauled to death. Oh, and then some girl turns up, making absolutely no sense, whatsoever. And going on about some abduction. It didn't occur to you to call me? Am I the only sane one on this fucking planet, or what? - Look, I'm sorry. - Yeah. You already said that. The guy's just got a little too... Oh, Jesus. Well, it looks like you got your work cut out for you. You'd better get on with it. Yeah. I best had. You'll have to excuse me. Come find me whenever you want. Mi casa su casa and all that. Asshole! Hey.
