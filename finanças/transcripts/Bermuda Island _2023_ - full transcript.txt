What do you want? We're here to see Diego. Well, everybody wants to see Diego. Everybody doesn't get to see Diego. Just get Diego out here, man. Time is money. You wait right here. And you better be on the level. 'Cause Diego gets really nasty when people screw him around. What the hell is this? Keep cool, man. Just keep cool. This could be a setup. What about you, man? You got the money or what? Why don't you show us the guns first? Let's see the money first. Let's go. I'm wasting my time. That's good. -That's real good. -Yeah. Guess we're in business, man. That's what I'm talking about. Diego Montalban, you're under arrest. Shit! The feds! Drop the gun! Shit! Fuck! Get down on your knees! Now! Diego Montalban, drop your gun! Shit! Just take it easy. Diego, you're under arrest for murder, arms dealing and money laundering. Sit your ass down. That's funny, man. You guys know today's my birthday? Want me to sing you a song? -Yeah, please. -Get on your feet. The storm is still hitting inland at over 100 miles an hour. The Coast Guard is struggling to deal with a large number of vessels that are in distress. I'm sure it's been mentioned, but it bears repeating, this is not normal. Normally, water patterns form so you can see the storms. But this, literally, came out of nowhere. Jimmy! -My brother! -How you doin'? Looks like a good party. Let's go party, it's our vacation time! I want to know what the problem is! -Ma'am, I told you. -Don't "ma'am" me. -There's inclement weather... -Inclement weather? ...a storm along the plane's path. A storm? Did you hear that? A storm. No, there's not. Look outside, it's perfectly sunny. That's why I said, "along the path." Would you like me to take your bags to be loaded? There's a lot of guests waiting behind you. Fine, take my bag. Come on, honey. Thank you for your understanding. - Checking in? - Yes, ma'am. I have Chris Sizemore and Michael Sizemore, does that sound correct? -That's correct. -That's us. All right, gentlemen, if you want to put your bags up here for me, I can get those tagged for you. Yeah, absolutely. We'll definitely be a lot less difficult than the last lady. I greatly appreciate your patience and understanding. -Ooh! Right there. -That's good. - Who's excited? - Yeah. Oh, can't wait. I'm so excited. Check this girl out. - Good to go? - Yeah. Have the few drinks. Oh, ooh, ooh! - What? - I'm so sorry. I'm Brett. Sorry, sorry. I saw such a beautiful girl, I thought I'd come say hi, you know what I mean? Well, now you've said hi. Are we done? Don't bother with these types. What do you mean by these types? Lesbians. What? Why don't you come here and I'll tell you what I am. I don't give a shit if you think I'm gay, straight, or the Virgin Mary. Take a hint and fuck off. It's about damn time you showed up. I get it, I get it. Everyone's sorry. I get it, I get it. Oh, look, they're the pilots. They must have finished their vodka tonics. -Who knows? -Maybe we can leave now. Definitely. Um, please take a seat, make yourself comfortable. We will be boarding shortly. We'll go have a seat and wait some more. Like we haven't been doing that all day. Again, we are so sorry. Yeah, I know. Everyone's sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, we are so sorry for the extending delay. Uh, we will be boarding shortly, so, please, make yourself comfortable. Have a great evening. Haven't escaped yet, I see. Well, we got plenty of time, so I'm not worried about it. That's about all you do have, is lots of time. Gentlemen, time to take the garbage out. Yes, sir. Let's go. -I never forget a face. -It's fine. Take a picture. This looks like it could be a lot of trouble. Maybe we should skip this one and get a later flight. Nah. They know what they're doing. He looks real badass. Must be famous. Probably killed a lot of people. I posted his photo already. Somebody's going to recognize him. Better try to get a seat next to him. -Good evening, ma'am. -Are you on this flight, sir? Afraid we are. I'm FBI agent Victor Sweden and that misfit we just took through there, is Diego Montalban, convicted felon. We're in the process of taking him down to the detention center, now that he's legal resident of Puerto Rico. Hey, you guys haven't heard of waiting in line, like normal people? You're not special. Only one that sounds special here is you. Hey, pig, I said back of the line. What, you want to say something to me? You have no idea what I'd like to say to you. Well, you're gonna have to speak up. Sir, please, go back to your seat. Let it go, Vic. - You might want to sit down. - Plane, Vic. -Lewis. -Yes, sir. I want you on that plane, too. Think he might be some trouble? I don't know. Just in case, right? Excuse me, um, I need to talk to you, um, about our newest passenger. What exactly are we dealing with here? He's a very dangerous guy, hence all the security detail. You know, it would have been nice if we've been briefed beforehand. Please, rest assured, my men are all professionals, they're very well trained in situations like this. Okay, thanks. Not to worry. So, who do you think is going to be the first one to demand to see the manager? Who do you think? So, what do you reckon will be the cause? Do you think it's going to be the weather, or do you think it's going to be our friend over there in handcuffs? Amber Ren√©e Sterling? What have I told you about talking to strangers? Sorry, Mom. Oh-- o-- oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, I-- I really didn't-- I-- I'm sorry. Now boarding flight PR 5623 to San Juan. Good evening, gentlemen. Thank you, enjoy your flight. Hello, thank you. Enjoy your flight. - Jonas, is that you? You haven't changed a bit. Still as handsome as ever. Oh, Irma, thank you. How have you been? I've been good, good. Just going on vacation. -What about you? -The same, apparently. Have you heard anything about this hurricane? Just what I heard on the news, so it should be over shortly, but by the time you get back in the south, it'll be gone. All right, sounds good. I'll see you on the plane. Enjoy your flight. - Hey, how you doing? - Good, man, how you doing? Hi. - Hi. Enjoying your vacation? - Hi. Um, I hope so, I'm gonna meet the guy I met online. -What's his name? -Matt. And he's pretty hot, actually. - Oh, really? - Not as hot as you. Oh! You're too kind, thank you. County fair? Sid, you're killing me. I said arenas only. We didn't have phones back in the day. The only cell was at the jail. We said goodbye in person. Well, that's a lovely story, Grandpapa, but, uh, it was a quieter age. A simpler time for sure. Excuse me. All this nostalgia is just killing me. I mean, "Oh, things were better back in the day." - Blah, blah, blah, blah. - Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, you're not really happy, I get it. But we're going on this trip to make you relax. He's my brother. Uh, well, he's my stepbrother. I'm Damon, by the way. Forgive my careless brother. I'm Jimmy. -I'm Carolyn. -Good to meet you. I'll just leave the two of you together. So, uh, why are you going to Puerto Rico? I, uh... just need a break from work and some time to relax. I understand. -I got your phone call. -Mm-hmm. This is an unprecedented situation. Well. If this hits social media, it will be really bad for us. Well, look, can we just re-- refuse to-- to carry it? -No? -No, I don't think so. I mean, I would if I could. -Um, I can go talk to him. -Okay. Is it that guy in first class? He's hard to miss, isn't he? -Mr. Montalban? -Uh-oh. I want you to know this plane is equipped to handle anything that you do. That's good. Man, this-- this always makes me nervous. Yeah? Why is that? You had a bad experience? My dad was on a plane that went down back in '83. He happened to survive, though. So, an event 40 years ago makes you nervous for a flight right now? I guess you got a point. So, relax. You got nothing to worry about. -Yeah. -Yeah, I guess you're right. Hey, boy scout. Wanna help me with my seatbelt here? -Huh? -Do it your damn self. "Damn self?" You from the south side? -South side of Texas? -The best side. "The best side. The best side." Okay, uh-- Hey, what about you, boy scout? You want to help me out? Jesus Christ. What are you, a child? My fucking five-year-old can do this. All right, well, come and help me out, man. - If this will shut you up. - Yeah. That's a good little girl scout right there. -Sit there-- -Gracias! Sit there and shut up. That's FBI right there, man, to protect and serve with a smile. -Can I speak to you? -Of course, you can. -If I could just take this off. -Shut up. In the galley. I'm Air Marshal Schneider. I would appreciate a heads up on the situation. I come on the plane and find out there's a convicted felon on board. Hope your men are able to control him. We're good. I see him causing you trouble, I'm going to restrain him myself. Understood? Any sign of trouble from you, I'll have no problem duct taping you to that seat. -Do you understand? -Okay. We'll see how that goes. Yeah, I'll go eat a bag of nuts. Not your nuts, hopefully. Schneider. I don't like this man aboard. FBI Agent Sweden. Got ID on you? Showed ID when I went through security. Obviously, I'd like to see it again. Is it against law to go on vacation? It's against law not to give me your ID. California. What is it you do there? A panel beater at a body shop. Can you prove it? Yeah, I'm on their websites. Pure Paint Body. What's this about? Checks out. Thank you. Have a good flight. Always nice helping law enforcement. Autopilot is set. What? Don't trust me to get us there? You are a fine aviator, Francis. -No doubt about that. -Thanks. It's me he doesn't trust. Okay. Get you guys anything while I'm back there? No, I'm good. Thanks, though. - Soda, please. - All right, what kind? - Um, Sprite. - All right. Great. -Excuse me. -Oh, hey, Captain. - Hi. How are you? - I'm doing well. Are we expecting any turbulence here? Oh, no. Actually, we're doing pretty good. -All right. -Take care now. You, too. -Excuse me. Was that the pilot? -Yeah. Are-- are we going to die? Oh, no, there's another copilot in there, it's just that he probably had to use the restroom, or get a drink or something. I assure you that it's perfectly normal. Um, is there anything else I can get either of you? No, thank you. I've got a screaming kid in my ear. I was hoping somebody could help me with this. Can I get an upgrade or something? Um, we have a couple of seats in first class, sir, but I'm afraid they're reserved for the prisoner transport, so, I don't know how you feel about that, but are you interested? Yeah, I'll take a pass on that. I thought you might. Okay, thank you. -Mom, where is he going? -It's fine. -What the fuck is going on? -We got struck by lightning. Is everything working? Powers out just for-- Just a second. How the fuck did you fly us into a storm? -I'm telling you, I didn't. -It came out of nowhere. Come on, baby. Come on, you piece of shit. Well, we're going to be fine. - Are we? - What's happening? Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, just breathe. Just breathe. If every would just please, sit down and relax. We were waiting for the storm to leave. Why is this happening? I don't-- I don't know why it's happening. It's okay, honey. He's going to do the best he can. We need to do something. People are scared. I understand you're all very deeply concerned, but if you'll please just take your seats, I'll find out but I need to get through here now, please, just-- I need to get through here, Sit down! Federal Marshal, folks. Stay in your seats, stay calm. Hi, Vic. Having a bad day, buddy? Fuck you. Get me a first aid kit. I'm a nurse. Get it now! Help him! Stay with me. Don't close your eyes. No! No! Tower, this is flight PR 5623. We have run into severe weather up here, and we have lost our number one engine. PR 5623, you are on course for San Juan currently, yes? Yes, we are. What-- what does that have to do with it? PR 5623, there's not a storm cell near you for at least 300 miles in any direction. You should have clear skies all the way. That makes no sense. PR 5623, if you're having engine trouble, I can help you get to the nearest airport, but your sky should be bone dry. Does he-- I have no idea what's going on here. Tower, you've got to be looking at the wrong screen. What the fuck is going on? Holy shit! Come on, baby. Get back there. Now, we're going down. - We're what? - Just get back here. We're going to assume the brace position. We're going to fucking crash. We are going to go down. Put seat belts on tight and have them assume the position, okay? We're gonna crash? - What? - Did he just say crash? Everyone, please, buckle your seats now! We're going down. Okay, everyone, I need you to remain in your seats and stay calm. Buckle up and assume the position. Ow! -Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm okay. Please, remain seated! Shit! Father, please forgive me. Thy kingdom come, it will be done in the name of Jesus. Check her pulse. ID. Oh, God! That sure was a shitshow. Been through worse. At least nobody's shooting at us. Kind of wish we were in the shit. At least we know who the enemy is. We'd know where we're at. Hey, is this, uh, Puerto Rico? No, bro. I've never seen this part of the island before. Who do I have to sue over this. Hold on. This is unacceptable. Hey, are you all right? Do I look all right? God. I-- I got makeup in my eyes. My hair dye is running. My chest tattoos are melting. I got sand in my pits. Come on, let me-- let me help you, okay? Just-- Come on. Darling. Shall we? One job. Couldn't even keep the plane in the air. When we get back to civilization, I'm filing complaints with the FAA and your superiors. I'm telling everybody about this, starting with the news outlets. Hell, I'm even gonna tell the kids down at the burger shop. What kind of asshole flies directly into a storm? -We didn't. -It came out of nowhere. The hell do you mean it came from nowhere? Clear skies, visibility, no wind. Then bam. Rain, lightning. I blinked, We were in the middle -of a storm. -Bullshit. You got a little bit of wind on you, buddy. Would you give it a break? He probably doesn't even speak English. Oh, I speak English. I just tend not to address. Hey, look. That guy needs help. Come on. I got you, homie. Almost there. What happened? Where are we? We crashed. That's all we know right now. Something about a storm. I'm gonna get you some drink of water. Yeah, I'll go get some. Anyone have directions to the nearest bodega? First one that wins gets whatever we find to eat. Yeah. Card up. -King -I like it. Two kings. How you doing? How you holding up? Pretty good. How about you? Mm. A little tired. You got a nasty wound here, pal. Oh, yeah. Well, if you keep picking at it, it will never get better. That is a sick wound. Would make for one hell of an album cover. I'm in the industry. Name is Midnight. Baphomet Records. Great. Are you going to help? Oh, yeah, absolutely. We want to survive as long as we possibly can. I thought you people love death. Well, yes, it's true. We do acknowledge death, but who doesn't, really? We just realize that death is a part of existence. I want to get as far down that track as possible. Great story and all, but I still got this issue, the glass in my arm. Right, so... count of three, shall we? -One. -One, two, three. Oh, uh, Amber, look at me. Look at me, please. She'll need to put a shirt on. We've only been here a couple hours. It's gonna get a hell of a lot hotter, before it starts easing off. Don't you think it's a little late for that? You want to go for a walk? Check out the rest of the beach? Let's go, let's go. - Yeah. - Hey. Get your ass back to work. That looks painful. Definitely. - Hey. - Yeah. Hey, I'm doing it. -It's not good. -Nope. Did you find any of the others? No one else. Everyone who survived must have washed up here. How many people were on that plane? -Hundreds. -Look how many survived. Look. We're not out of the woods yet. And I fear our numbers may drop further. But we need Amber. Huh? We will light a candle for those who have passed, when we get back to civilization. -All right? -Okay. I saw some horses. Well, now. I'm going to play cowboy, I'm going to need my hat. - Hey, a boat. - Yeah. Maybe we can get out of here. Let's check it out. Maybe we can fix it. Well, I'm going to go see if I can find any supplies. Sure. Yeah, I don't think we can fix this. Mags? Mags? Mags? Mags, where are you? What is that? Maggie? - Yeah. - Mags, what the fuck? - Careful! - Oh, my God. - Sorry. - Let's go this way. Oh, my God. Dude. What were you looking for down there? - For you. - Why would I be down there? Get off of me, get off me. Damn seagulls. Get away from me! I-- I-- I was just having a, um-- -Having a nightmare? -Yeah, uh-- What happened to us? If we had crashed anywhere near town, there would be people coming out here now. Looks like we're on our own. We're going to start surviving, okay? I really want to help, but I just don't know how. When do we get to eat? If I had some food, I'd give it to you, but it looks like we're all under the same circumstances Now, what we need the most is water. -Where did you get that? -Right out there. From the ocean? Dude, do not, under any circumstances, drink ocean water, come on. We can walk around the island, try to find a river. You know, in a pinch... you can drink your own urine. Ew. I mean, it doesn't taste great, but it gets the job done. We just need to build something. Like what? Maybe we can build something off the ground. Protect us from enemies. We need to find a clear space. It's a lot easier than clearing it ourselves. Then, we build a barrier around us. A man with a plan. I like it. Let's do it. All right, ladies and gentlemen. we don't know how long we're going to be out here on this island. Our first priority right now needs to be to build a shelter. We need food. That should be our first priority. There's no point in eating if our bodies are just going to be left out here to die in this environment. There's no point in having shelter if we're just lying there, starving to death. This is survival. No one gives a shit about your opinion. Oh, girls, put your claws away. I'd say you're both right. There's no reason why we can't do both plans. We have enough people here. Fine. Two groups. You go find your food. We can build a shelter. -Does that work for you? -Oh, tip-top. Vicky. Maybe we can build a raft and try to get the hell out of here. You gonna lend me your axe? How about enough of your sarcasm and you do something important? Listen, even if we built one, we still don't know which way to go. All right, so what is the plan? Whatever it is, we should get started. What are we looking for? I don't know, just... anything that can be considered food. Careful where you step. Could be snakes. If we step on one and it doesn't bite us, we could always kill it. Snakes? Keeps getting better and better. Don't worry about it, man. I had a friend that collected snakes. He said you can tell the poisonous ones by the markings. But then again, when you get close enough to look at them, you're in the danger zone. I hate snakes. Ow! Damn it. Amber Ren√©e Sterling. What have I told you about cursing? 'Atta girl. Keep it up. We're going to need that to stay warm. -Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. -What? -Do you know what that is? -No. All right, listen up, everybody. If you find something to eat and you don't know what it is, just don't eat it, okay? There's plenty of stuff out here that can kill us. So, how do we know if anything's safe to eat here? How are we supposed to test it? Just try it, I guess. If you're okay, tomorrow we can come back for more. Well, we could draw lots and loser has to eat shit. Or, maybe, we could vote on it and the loser has to eat everything. Well, then, you're probably screwed. Calm down. Calm down. Let's just, you know, relax. Calm down. Well, you're our fearless leader. So why aren't you out there volunteering, hm? I mean, what exactly is the grand plan? Is it just to stay here and slowly starve and then go pick shit off of the bushes willy-nilly? Look, I only know so much about survival, and most of that is the shit I've seen on TV. I don't think Vic, or any of us for that matter, knows too much more. Guys, let's split into pairs. Stay close to your buddy, and if you find something, say something. And who put you in charge? Do you have a better plan? All right, guys. Just relax, okay? I think it's a great plan. All right. I'll take as my partner, uh-- uh, what's your name again? Akira. Yes, my good, faithful companion. Akira and I will head over this way and, uh, see what we can find. Shall we sally forth? Yes. Let's go. Hey, uh, do you know Amber? She says she saw wild horses on this island, so maybe we can capture one of them and eat it. Oh, do you have any home recipes for horse? Why would I? I am joking, darling. I'm joking. I-- it's just that once I was in the Alps on tour, and I had an exquisite, Hirschenrouladen in a Bavarian farm village. Oh! Now, the Germans, they sort of frown upon that sort of thing, but if you have enough of this, they'll let you get away with, you know a little-- Uh, let's see. Let's see if we can find some more nuts. I mean, I already got two myself, - but, you know-- - nuts. Hey, you got three. You're doing well, man. More than me. Let's see if there's anything higher up. Maybe we'll be lucky to find one of those lizards. - Is that a crab? - Huh? -Hey, check this out. -Oh, that's cool. Let me try to get it. -Okay. -Okay. Careful. I think we can eat this. Grab it. Akira, look what I found! Shit. What do we have here? Here, horsey, horsey, horsey. Come to Midnight. So, you think there's any fish, or anything we can catch in there? Maybe piranhas? No, no, no, no, no. There could be alligators. They like to lay and wait. Maybe we should split up. We'll cover more ground that way. Okay. I'll go this way. Wow. What is this place? Hello? Akira. No, no, no. -Is that Dawkins? -I think so. Hey, Dawkins? Dawkins! What the-- -Damon. -Wait, hold on. I think there's something out there. Is that an arm? Oh, oh, oh! Y'all should run. Just-- Come on! What the fuck? It's gonna take more than you to fucking take me down. Was that... Dawkins's arm? I think so. All right. So, who are you people, and what are you doing here? Where the hell did you come from? Say, if I hadn't just stepped in now, every single one of you would be dead, so I'd appreciate it, if you would answer my goddamn questions when I ask them. We were flying to Puerto Rico, when our-- our plane went down and... -we wound up here. -Shit. I think now I'd give up hoping for a rescue party. I'm sorry, man, but, uh... we're not a rescue party. Didn't you see that plane that went down? No, I, uh... I keep to myself. Well, we're all that's left of a full aircraft. Probably going to be a lot more bodies washing up soon. We were hoping supplies would wash up as well. Yeah, well, you'd be better off fishing... during the day. We suddenly just figured that out. How many more of those things are out there? There's enough. - Oh, shit! Come on. - Come on. Come on. Oh, shit! Look out! Over there! I got one! Let's see what you have! You have anything fire? Mommy, he ate me. Wait. Hold up. - Over there. - Look out. Keep firing. Keep firing. Run! Come on. Let go! I got you! Oh, shit. I go high, you go low. You already know. It's scared of us, look! Me and my brother kicked your ass. Shit! This doesn't look too good, bro. Oh, shit. They don't like burning. Stay back, stay back. Where'd you come from? Those damn things just took out half our group. Yeah. Yeah, they'll do that. But didn't take half your people. Not yet. Not friends of yours, are they? No. Killed my whole team on the very first day we were here. -So this is your fault. -My fault? You're the one that took some of the group off - and got five of them killed. - Look, we don't need any more fighting tonight, all right? Man, to hell with this. Any of you guys want to come with me, you can get up and come on. Or you can stay with him and wind up dead. It's not a good idea to split up the party. Did I ask you? -No. -Good. Come on, guys. I'm with you, boss. I'm with you. Vic. Wait. What? He's with the FBI. Seems like he knows what he's doing. As long as he doesn't have us running around like headless chickens, I'm gonna follow him, girl. -Wait, you can't be serious. -Wait! Are you leaving us? Mags? I just don't wanna see anyone else die. Hey! We came here together, we're getting out of here together. It's just-- It's not safe. I have to. Where the hell are you going? Chance of survival seems to be better with the FBI agent. I know we don't. -Good luck to you. -Thanks, man. -I'm rolling with them. -No. No. What? Trust me. Well, fuck. -Good morning. -Hey. So, tell me... how much do you really know about survival? Um... Not much, really. All right, everybody, up. Come on, up. So, I assume you all have... limited knowledge and experience surviving in the wild. Well, I'm willing to teach you if you're willing to learn. We have limited daylight hours. It starts to get dim, those things get bolder. We have a lot to do in a little time if you all want to make it through the night. So, we should probably start with torches. These things fear fire. Torches are priority number one. You always want to have a couple on hand, in case it goes out. So, the sea is fruitful and generous. She is also loaded with sharks. So, we try to keep this in the shallows. So the idea is we create an inland. Tide moves in, traps the fishes, -it moves out. -How long does that take? Check back later today. Tomorrow morning at the latest. And I think it's best we keep these burning at all times. So make extra. What we're going to be doing is making fish traps. Pretty simple concept. What we're gonna do is we're going to take these rocks... We're going to put them around just like this. Until we have one small opening for a high tide so the fish can come and swim in. Once the water goes down and low tide comes... we'll have fish. Greatest danger during the day is the sun, so we need to build some kind of shelter. Good. Good. There. You can build it as big as you like, but usually the smaller it is, the more stable. Good. It's good. Got it. Good. All right, well... let's get these torches up. This guy is a godsend. You're right about that. We're so lucky. Hey. Come with me. -Come on. -Okay. Isn't it beautiful? I found it when I was looking for supplies earlier. You're beautiful. You guys having fun out there? I just figured if you guys were done, maybe I could, uh, take over. There's not a chance. Why don't you beat it? Now, that's not nice. You want to learn how to survive on this island, you need to learn how to share. Is that all you got? Where do you think you're going? You fully have no idea. Get up, pretty boy. Come on. Oh, shit. Where the hell am I? Fucking bitch. I'm so sorry. It's not my fault. Is this what you want? Is this what you want? Did you kill my baby? Did you kill my Amber? Come on. Let's see what you could do when someone's actually facing you. You're not so tough now, are you? Maybe we could try again. I'm sure there are plenty of other waterfalls around. Where'd you two sneak off to? It's all right. Hey. Y'all come with me. I'd like to show you something. Where are you taking us? Home. Got a lot of rainwater if you're thirsty. Hell, I even have a little rum if it suits you. So, um... what's your story, Bruce? I was out running maneuvers with my crew and out of nowhere, our tech went haywire and we went down. We were in the water for three days before we washed up on the island. They all got picked off on the first night. Then, I was alone. It must have been hard on you. Yeah. At first. Time is a funny thing, you know. I put marks in trees at first to count the days. Forget a few times, then why bother? After that, all the days just run together. The nights, they just bleed in, bleed out, bleed in, bleed out. You lose track. After I figured out the creatures are afraid of fire, survival wasn't too difficult. I just wanted to keep an extra torch lit. Oh, but Christ, I do miss the world. Anybody back home? Yeah. Sure do. My wife, Sally. My boy, Steven. They're beautiful. Bruce, uh... which war were you in? What do you mean, which war? The war. The Great War. What? Oh, your accident. What was the date? September 19th. Uh, no, the year. 1917. What? Our accident, Bruce. May 16th, 2022. The War ended, like, 100 years ago. -He's right. -You're fucking with me. No, I'm not. Well, it doesn't make sense, it's... Here. Take a look. It's my driver's license. -Here. -Oh. I was born in 1992. I don't understand. I don't-- I don't-- That would mean my wife... -my boy. -I'm sorry. Did we win? What? The war. Did we win? Yeah. We won. Good. That's good. Why don't you all head back to the beach? And I'll, uh... catch up with you later. Bruce. All right. Come on. I think I know a way, okay? Let's give him some time. -Damon? -Yeah. I don't think we're gonna see Bruce for a few days. Yeah, I know. Could you imagine being told that? Not in a million years. How is he still so young? How is he over 100 years old? Honestly, none of this makes sense. The triangle. It's real. Real as in? The disappearance of boats, ships and planes. They enter the Bermuda Triangle and then boom, they're gone. They just vanish into nothingness. Maybe this is where they end up. And what science makes sense for that? I don't know. I mean, maybe it's, uh... reality warping or... another dimension. I-- I have no clue. Yeah, well, how do we get out of here? You don't. Apparently, I have been stuck here for over 100 years. It's just like one big, goddamn circle. Well, the way I see it, if we found a way in, we can find a way out. Yeah. But first, we gotta survive. Wake up! - I'm okay. - Stay with us. It's gonna be okay. Hey. How is she? I don't know, Damon. I'm not a fucking doctor. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. I don't know if she's going to make it. Her injuries might be too severe to save her. I understand but... right now, I'm trying to save all of us. Come on. We have a plan. Can't you tell me here? We shouldn't leave her. It won't take long, I promise. Okay. You really think this is a good idea? It's the best one we've got. I can teach you what you need to know. But this is do or die. All right? There's no contingency. There's no fallback option. There's no cavalry. It's us and them. Yeah, dozens and dozens of them. Maybe hundreds? - No. I've been around them long enough to get a general head count. They're a tribal species. Pack hunters like wolves. But I'll warn you... there is an alpha. A pack leader, and he will be the hardest to kill by far. But total? Maybe two dozen. Maybe. There's a few weapons you'll have to get comfortable with. Spear, bow and arrow. A spear can be thrown, but works great for close-quarters combat. It's the monsters, you got to get close, 'cause they've got teeth and they've got claws. And the spear will help keep that distance. Let's go through it again. You have got to be kidding me. Wrong. close-quarters combat. Oh. It's uh... it's two fingers. Oh, hell yeah, Carolyn. That was awesome. I threw javelin in college. I gotta check on Dakota. Okay. So, I'm thinking next, we'll work on forging some weapons. There's plenty of materials out here on this island we can use to put some together. Bows and arrows, spears. We can even use them for hunting. And what about for silencing overpromising assholes? I'm sorry, what was that? Oh, our great leader, the honorable FBI agent, he's a con. He's been lying to us the whole time. If it hadn't been for him following Damon and the rest of the group, we'd probably be dead by now. -What's she talking about? -Man, look at her. - She's confused. - No. Every single thing you have done, you stole from that vet in the other group. Is that true, Vic? What does it matter where I got it from? Because that was the whole point. You were supposed to be this superior leader. Your knowledge and expertise were supposed to save us and get us off this island. I'm a liar. You're alive, aren't you? You could have left. I never told you I was a survivalist. I never said follow me. That's just your own damn fault. You assumed. -Hey, captain. -Yeah? Mutiny. Mutiny. For your crimes of lying, misleading. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What were you saying? We never should have trusted you, you piece of shit. What is he doing? What was that about a mutiny? I said I would do anything to get us all out of this alive. I guess that was everybody but you. It's my fault. How? I forgot to make sure the torch was lit. I mean, it's an honest mistake. You don't get the big picture, do you? -We've got a plan-- -Do you really want to spend the rest of your life here worrying about having a fire lit? And what happens if the oil runs out? You're putting a whole lot of faith in this plan of his. And what if it doesn't work out? Then what? Then we die. This is it. Either we kill them all... or we die. God, I'm such an idiot. Almost there. Ah, Jesus. Jimmy, I'm getting really tired-- I hope you get food poisoning. The monsters holed up here. This is all open beach, so they won't have anywhere to go but the ocean. They're not as afraid of that as they are of the fire. We have a preset booby trap waiting for them with the oil encircling them. Once we get them in there, we just need someone to come up the back where they came in, close off the circle. After that, it's pretty much just target practice. So, how do we head them into the trap space? We're going to need bait. What kind of-- Oh, my God. - You son of a bitch. - Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go ahead, sweetheart. Just give me a reason. Where's Frank? - No. - Both of them traitors. Frank... and this little bitch. Fuck you. What the fuck? All right. All right. What do you want? I favored your plan. Sounds good. And you mentioned something about bait? Someone's gonna have to lead him into the center of the circle. Problem with that is that, uh-- Flames on one side... creatures on the other. - Exactly. - I'll do it. Jimmy, no. Damon, let me do this. So touching. So.... What's your plan on how we're gonna get off this island? First, we need to set up the oil trap from the outside. Except the entrance, right? That's right. Somebody's gonna have to come in from behind just to finish it off. -They're gonna have to be fast. -How fast? Fast enough to get it closed off, but not so fast you catch yourself on fire. I'll do it. I used to run track in college. - I can handle it. - All right. I give you the signal, you close it off. Gonna have to be quick, though, cause those fuckers are fast when they wanna be. You'll have seconds at best. You have to make sure you get them all in the circle. All right? Blood, loud noises, draw them out. No fire anywhere near you. Then Damon comes along... closes off the circle. After that, we pick them off, let them burn themselves up. We have to make sure we keep that fire going. What if something goes wrong? Well, then we'll deal with it. Over here! Go! Jimmy! Are you insane? Where my plan starts to differ from yours. You need to think about this. Hey, I knew we couldn't trust you! -Mike! -Go! I can't. Go. What are you? This is my island. It looks like Paradise... ...but we're as far away from it as you can get. And I... I am the closest thing to the Devil that you will find here. Shit. Eat well. Who knows when the next group is coming?
