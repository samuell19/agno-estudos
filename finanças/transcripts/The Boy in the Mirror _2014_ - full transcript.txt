THE BOY IN THE MIRROR I stiII think this is not going to work. Engine! Oh my God! I don't want to see it. Fernando! Fernando! I said this wouIdn't work! Can I go next, can I be the first? Are you hurt? Here, Iike that, come on, come on. I toId you. Boy, what about my Ioss? Fernando, mother has aIready caIIed, hurry up. Gotcha! Oh no!? You were praying, you're a saint? Maybe... What a perfumed IittIe boy! What is this? Mother, forget it, it's just a scratch. Wait a minute, you are aII scraped, how come? Where did you get hurt, Fernando?! Mother, it, it's just a scratch. On a sIope, with an airpIane, the yoke broke and the pIane crashed. You see that Domingos, you see that, now he's hiding things! Toninho, go to the bedroom. Son, your mother and I worry about your shenanigans. A man can't Iive off adventures... But father, it was the pIane's yoke... Son, we have to think about the future. But father, I do think about the future. In the future, there wiII be spaceships and intergaIactic traveIIing just Iike in FIash Gordon. Son, I'm taIking about yourfuture! Because if you keep going Iike that, what wiII it be Iike? What wiII you be when you grow up? I wanted to be a piIot, but, after what happened today, I haven't decided yet. The secret to be happy in Iife, my son, is to think about others. Look at me, you are grounded for a week for having hidden the scrapes. No pIaying in the yard, no pIaying on the street. Go to your bedroom. In the earIy hours of May 1 1th, enemies of the State raised vioIence and factious hatred in form of action. The individuaIs who committed the burgIary of residentiaI homes to butcher their residents were, in generaI, mere assassins. Fernando!? Fernando!? HeIIo, Fernando!? HeIIo, Mariana!? Fernando, did you mother see you aII hurt? I tried to hide it but she saw and I'm grounded for a weeK, I can't Ieave home. But did you say who you were with? Mariana, of course not. We have to be carefuI not to put our organization at risk, Fernando. Don't be siIIy, I kept my mouth shut! Fernando... I've got to go. Turn that phone off. Good night. Good Morning, Ms. RisoIeta! Latin notebook opened. Lupus maIus Lupo maIo Lupe maIe Luporum maIorum Lupus maIus Lupo maIo Lupe maIe Luporum maIorum Lupus maIus Lupe maIe Luporum maIorum Lupos maIos Lupi maIi Just pretend, MagaIi. Lupus maIus Lupo maIo Lupe maIe Luporum maIorum Lupos maIos Lupi maIi Let's move to the next decIension. Cockroach! Gross! SiIence! I want to know right now who did this? You have untiI the end of the cIass to teII me who the smarty-pants is. Birica, Birica, take the bIame one and for aII! It's not funny anymore. Take the bIame for what? You're going to Iet everyone here get burnt forthis cIowning? Forthis cIowning, do I Iook Iike a cIown by any chance? Yes, and do I Iook stupid by any chance? Do I Iook dumb? Yes. Mind your own business, Fernando. So? Have we got the one responsibIe yet? Fernando is crazy standing up to Birica. Idiots! What did you say Mariana? These boys are aII idiots. But what have I done? Birica is going to be expeIIed. And you are in deep troubIe with him Fernando. He was the one who Iet the cockroaches out. Fernando. Fernando. What? Keep your eyes open! What are you taIking about Jacarй? We'II get you outside. When are you going to stop getting yourseIf into troubIe? Now, you're screwed up! Birica is going to beat the socks off of you and I'm sure I'II get caught in the crossfire... What a wimp! No, I'm not a wimp! Are you not?! So Iet's see who has the guts to steaI that mango overthere. Let's go. Fernando, where did that crazy Pedro go? There. So the boys Iike mango!? Finders keepers! I'm watching you! I think we'II end up being discovered. Pedro, stop being such a wimp. But it's not safe to aIways assembIe in the same pIace. But, we have a new secret weapon. Let's carry on with the meeting. I officiaIIy decIare the meeting of our F.A.R.T., FamiIy Affairs Research Troop, open. Toninho, you are not meant to fart for reaI. But I didn't fart, DeviI did. We are going to discuss about the abandoned house. The abandoned house? I thought the meeting was about Pape Faria. He stoIe my mango and that's that? PascaI Faria? Mango? What are you taIking about? Look, I've seen a ghost there. That house is haunted and eviI! Is it Pedro? Is there a house that is haunted and friendIy? I don't think we shouId mess with ghosts. If there is a ghost, it must be guarding a treasure. See that? Just saying it and something happens. You are shitting yourseIf, aren't you Pedro, because of the haunted house! Yeah right. It is decided! We wiII investigate the curse of the Haunted House. Here comes more grounding. I think mom's home. What were yourfriends doing here today? They were studying. You are Iying. That is not what we taught you. Go to your room, no radio for you tonight. But father, I didn't Ieave home. You are grounded. That aIso means that pIay doesn't come into the house. Go on Fernando. Gotcha! Fernando, knock it off with that baII! What is it?! What are you Iooking at? Do you want a piece of me? Fernando, stop fooIing yourseIf. When Birica gets you yourface wiII never be the same... Say goodbye because it'II become oId meat. Good morning! Who are you? I am Odnanref. Your refIection. My refIection, I'm dreaming again! But, what are you made of? FIesh and bone? Sure. But what are you doing here, outside the mirror? Last night, when you went to my worId, I thought you were in troubIe so I came to heIp you. Besides, I'm tired of pIaying cowboy. But, what is your name again? Odnanref! What?! Odnanre... Odnanref! Fernando backwards! Ok... you came here to heIp me, right? Of course. So the timing couIdn't be better... Do you know that saying: ''do as I say, not as I do''? Fernando, come and have breakfast! Great, I have a doubIe! I have a doubIe! TaIking by yourseIf my son? No, taIking to myseIf. It's time for breakfast, come on. Toninho, have a good day. Have you thought about the idea of a boarding schooI? Fernando, quit pIaying and go to your pIace. Go on. Ihhh, she's his boss! Fernando. Don't you say good morning anymore? Good morning. Fernando, you're in a worId of your own today, huh? Today is the day! After cIass. Major, the situation is criticaI, our hearquarters were cIosed, our companions are being arrested, our Ieader is at risk of being exiIed. If we carry on with the meeting, we couId go to jaiI. It's time to resist. Convince yourseIf then you'II convince others. Do you reaIIy think it's safe, Major? AImeida, I fuIfiI my duty to serve God Ioving the country He gave my BraziIian brethren and me. If I am saying the meetings wiII be here at my pIace from now on, it's because it's safe. Then I wiII teII the others the meeting wiII be here at 8 o'cIock, Anauк Major! Anauк AImeida. DeviI! Jacare and Birica! Jacare and Birica! Two Fernandos. Are you crazy? No, I swear! I saw two! Two Fernandos? One, two. Two Fernandos. Cut it out, cut it out you two! What is this Domingos? It must be termite. Oh God. You have to fix this! My rug! Oh go on. There is something different about you today! I can't quite put my finger on it. Fernando, are you Ieft-handed? What about Birica? Attention BraziI, Attention! Dear Iistener, today we have a great historic event, the cIash: David versus GoIiath. In this corner, weighing 25kg, wearing shorts crapped with fear, Fernando. In the other corner, weighing one ton and a haIf, Jacare and Birica. I have no idea how you did that yesterday, but today you won't get away! If there's anyone man enough Iet him step on this! Are you crazy Fernando!? Fight! Fight! Fight! Go on Jacare! Get rough if you're man enough! Your refIex is too sIow, you have to improve. Fernando! Fernando! Wow, I never knew Fernando was so quick, MagaIi. I know, what about Jacare? Mariana! Yeah, that fight, boys wiII be boys, right. Mariana! Mariana! Come here. MagaIi, I must go in. Okay. I'II see you tomorrow. See ya. Fernando. Where is your uniform? I've aIready changed. What about the grounding? I ran away Mariana! What if your motherfinds out Fernando. She won't. Look Mariana, I have to show you something. Show me what? Come, DeviI, come! Come, DeviI, come! Let's go Fernando, I'm tired of staring at nothing happening. See that I wasn't making it up? Good night mom, good night dad. Good night mon, good night dad. Good night chiIdren. Good night chiIdren. These boys act differentIy each day. Come here. What is it? Stop nagging at the chiIdren and cut a rug with me. Stop it Domingos, no, they couId come out. Come in, DeviI, go on! Domingos, Domingos, did you hearthat? Hum... Go to sIeep Odete. -Hey Fernando. -What? This is PascaI Faria's house. Why not go through the front? Because you don't face the enemy going through the front! We're going to face a ghost and you are scared of a seniIe oId man? Ssshhh, quiet you two! I want to pee! Pee, now? Now! HoId that pee in there! The peopIe, without the presence of God, under the government of a feebIe, IiberaI and democratic state, Toninho, go overthere and peek through the window. Why me? Because he's a wuss, she's a girI and I've got the Iamp. No I'm not. BraziI needs a firm hand to create a strong nation, founded on the beIief in. God, the importance of famiIy and on keeping the sociaI order. We, the reaI sentineIs, saIute ourtrinity: God, Country and FamiIy. Anauк! Anauк!!! For what is best for BraziI. Very weII gentIemen, Iet's begin our meeting addressing a very important issue. Our safety. Vargas's minions are after us, there is a price on our heads. Toninho, what did you see? I think they are praying! Praying? Praying. Come on Fernando, Iet's go. HoId this for me. DeviI... Look. I'm tired of hoIding, hoId it. Me, you and Mariana, we go in the house. You stay on watch with DeviI. Why me? Because. Let go of me Pedro. It is just a kitten. What are you doing here, you brats? DeviI, come back here! You deserve a good beating! Come, Fernando, come! The man is coming after us. Run Toninho! Come Toninho! Abadias. Major. What happened? I think it was arson, major. Excuse me. Anauк! Who taught you that? Son, come here. -Son, you cannot do that. -Why not dad? Because I beIieve the state shouId be democratic, therefore free from reIigious infIuences. It shouId be secuIar. We have to ensure ourfreedom of speech: poIiticaI, reIigious, as weII as the fuII exercise of our civiI rights... Domingos... He is onIy six years oId. You can't because you can't! It's time for schooI, you'II be Iate. -You right. -Come on. WouId you possibIy know what couId have happened Iast night in the abandoned house... I know that underneath these innocent faces are troubIemakers. Good morning, Major PascaI Faria! May I heIp you with anything? How have you been, Mrs Odete?! Mr Domingos. CouId you teII me why my sons haven't gone to schooI yet? By the way, did you hear the racket Iast night? I didn't hear a thing. Why, did anything happen? The abandoned house was set on fire, the one on the other street! And what do my sons have to do with this, Major? Nothing! Ijust asked if they had seen anything. After aII, your sons are angeIs, right?! You stay away from my house and from my famiIy. Anything eIse major? If not, take care Mr. RascaI Faria. It's PascaI! PascaI Faria! Mariana, why did you bring this thing? Not thing! Now, he's got a name! It's ''Shitty'', right! Not Shitty, it's Kitty, you dork! ''Shitty'', Kitty, I don't care. F.A.R.T is a serious thing not a zoo. But what about DeviI? DeviI, DeviI is very usefuI, he saved us Iast night. But Kitty was saved by F.A.R.T., F.A.R.T. is responsibIe for him, Fernando. Shitty stays! It's Kitty! We have more important stuff to discuss. F.A.R.T. is in danger. PascaI Faria is on to something. UntiI we find out what it is, we cannot taIk to anyone about the abandoned house, understood? I don't agree. I think Iast night was too dangerous and we couId have been kiIIed. I think F.A.R.T shouId stop the missions for a whiIe. I agree with Pedro, Fernando, he is right. HeIIo, Fernando, Fernando. Hi, Mariana! We must summon a meeting of F.A.R.T. It's urgent! Kitty went missing Iast night! ''Shitty'' disappeared? Not Shitty, Kitty. Guys, this is serious! Mariana, he is a cat. Cats are not Iike dogs. He'II be back. I think F.A.R.T shouId investigate his disappearing. No, we're drawing to much attention to ourseIves. I think someone's coming. Cintia, my chiId, I have missed you. How was your trip? Good, aunt, yes. But I didn't remember it took so Iong to get to BeIo Horizonte. The trip is Iong indeed. What about your parents, everyone is weII? Yes, everybody is weII, they send their Iove to everyone. Have a seat, I'II get us some Iemonade. Don't worry about it, aunt. Domingos, take her bags to the bedroom. Excuse me, Cintia. Don't be shy, so are you excited about the university? The decision is not finaI yet, I came to get to know the university and the city. It is a Iot quieter than Sгo PauIo, I think you are going to Iike it. Termite!? Odete. This time, I'm screwed, I'm reaIIy screwed. Not reaIIy, yourfather wiII Iet you off easy as usuaI. No, he won't, my mother wiII bug him untiI he makes a decision. Look, just go out there, Iet my mother Iecture and don't taIk back. It's mischief after mischief. First the pIane crash, then you try to escape the grounding and now the dining room ceiIing. Fernando, we work so hard for you two... Enough Domingos, enough. Be straight with him. Fernando, we're sending you as an intern to a miIitary schooI, got it? You see that, right? Go to your room Fernando. Domingos. What is that Odete? The enroIment. But Odete... Domingos! HeIIo! Come in Fernando. Are your parents going to ground you? WeII, I'm aIready grounded. Is there anything fun to doin this town? Ah! There is the cinema, popcorn, ice cream. There's not a Iot. I wanted to go to the movies so badIy! Too bad you can't, right? Being grounded. Of course I can! Ah! What a shame, it won't be possibIe! The fiIm is for aduIts onIy. But I think I can get in! And forfree! Go DeviI! It was decreed by His ExceIIency The President of the RepubIic, Dr GetuIio DorneIes Vargas, it was decreed iIIegaI. The Green Shirts are now wanted by the poIice, report, cooperate with our country, meetings, suspicious activities and pubIic gatherings of the Green Shirts wiII now be punished with arrest. WeII Fernando, I'm going inside, ok. Uhum. You'II not beIieve where I went today. Who's the hag? She's my cousin from Sao PauIo, we went to the movies together. Mariana is jeaIous. Idiots! She is jeaIous. Never mind these too. What was the movie about? Ah, it was a movie caIIed ''The BIue AngeI''. It's not properfor a young Iady to go to the movies on her own. You don't say, aunt! In Sao PauIo that is but too normaI. Tomorrow, I'II go to MedicaI SchooI with you. There's no need uncIe. I'm going there just to have a Iook, I'II go on my own. I mean, me and my guardian angeI. -Fernando, Fernando. -Fernando. HeIIo Fernando. HeIIo Fernando. HeIIo Mariana. Are you there? I'm caIIing to ask what F.A.R.T. is going to do about KITTY. I need to find my cat. I'm very busy now! Fernando, get ready for schooI! Hey, Fernando, Fernando. -What? -What's your pIan? PIan for what? About Kitty's missing, for goodness' sake!

Look Mr. RefIection, you are mine. You do as I say! That was the deaI! DeaI? What deaI?! I am tired of Iiving the boring part of your Iife, I'm tired of having to baiI you out aII the time. Now Cinthia is mine, the treehouse is mine, yourfreedom is mine. It's aII mine. By the way, I have to go. Life is going to be a Iot better with you Iocked up in a boarding schooI! What are you taIking about?! Therefore two objects cannot occupy the same pIace at the same time, why? Because of the fundamentaI properties of matter. They are: Mass... Mariana, Fernando and Pedro, you stay! Fernando, come with me. The others wait here. Mister Fernando, Major PascaI Faria came to us making serious accusations. They are not accusations. What I'm presenting you is the confession of a regretfuI student. So Mr. Fernando, do you have anything to say about the fire of the house. It was me! The responsabiIity is mine and my own. None of the kids outside has anything to do with it. It was an accident. But nothing I say wiII change the opinion of any aduIt. Because you are aIways right. Right? Given your confession, there isn't much I can do. You may Ieave. You may go now kids. Anauк! PrincipaI, I don't reaIIy know if any of these chiIdren actuaIIy took part in this incident. In case they did, I assure you there was no intention or bad faith to harm whomever. The accusations are serious Ms. RisoIeta and Fernando confessed. ExactIy! Our roIes as educators is not just teaching how to read and write. But the brat confessed. ExactIy! Not onIy did he confess, but took aII the bIame himseIf. That says he's got character, that he's not afraid to teII the truth. Interesting point of view, Mrs. RisoIeta, very interesting. I can't beIieve you wiII take into consideration the words of this... this... Mr. Major PascaI, I think you have aIready said aII you had to say. I ask both of you to Ieave and I'II think about the subject and make a decision. Take care, Major! PIease Ms. RisoIeta, waIk the Majorto the door! Major, I'd put an end to this story right here. That's forthe Sheriff to decide. I think the Sheriff is too busy hunting and arresting men in green shirts. What are you suggesting?! Anauк, Major! HeIIo Mariana. HeIIo Mariana, can you hear me Mariana? Hi Fernando! HeIIo Mariana? Hi Fernando! Are you there? That's fantastic, you have a doubIe!!! WeII, the miIitary schooI is a fact... Your parents know what you're Iike Fernando, they'II never beIieve you didn't set the house on fire... Your crush on your cousin is your probIem! As for Odnanref... Maybe I can heIp you. We're about to cIose, ok. Very weII. That's ''Macunaнma'' by Mario de Andrade? Yes, it's. I Iove Mario de Andrade. Thank you sir. You're weIcome. Fernando, the book. Thank you. Mariana, what is this pIace? It is a Iibrary-hideout. Give up Mariana, I'm screwed. Fernando, you can't give up. There has to be a way. You are not going to Iose to yourseIf. What did you just say? Fernando, you can't give up, there has to be a way. You can't Iose to yourseIf. Two objects cannot occupy the same pIace at the same time. Matter attracts matter. Come with me Mariana. Good evening Mr. RefIection. Look RefIection, you wiII give me my Iife back today! Now. Life? What Iife? Who said this Iife is yours? You asked for me in the first pIace. Now I am Fernando.

Dad, I have the answer! To what son?! To that question. What question? What I want to be when I grow up! And what do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be a chiId! Come on, come on. Go, DeviI, get out!
