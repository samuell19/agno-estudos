Subtitles by explosiveskull Every journey has its road. And every road, sooner or later, comes to a crossing, certain junction and only one choice to make. That crossing arrived for us, too. But no one could have imagined that it would change our fates forever. Lunar eclipses have fascinated mankind throughout the ages. The relationship between man and Moon has always been so strong that in certain ancient cultures these phenomena were perceived as cause for great concern. - Are you guys watching? - I've already seen one on YouTube. I think I watched with my dad. I've got a pair of welder glasses at home like you. I could lend them to you. No. Welded glasses are for solar eclipses, not lunar eclipses. And they're not that great anyway because of the double refraction. The double what? - The double refraction. - Yeah? Otherwise known as the birefringence, an optical phenomenon caused by the light and... Idiot. Lunar eclipses were, in fact, interpreted to be symbolic of the great afternoon sky right over there. Bleh! Stories and legends aside, this eclipse will be one of the longest and the most fascinating total lunar eclipses of the last century. So, tonight, we encourage you all to lift your heads to the sky and take in this spectacular and unique event. Don't miss out. Or you'll be waiting 20 years for the next one. Hey, Bess, will you watch it? Um, I'm not sure. Maybe with a certain someone. Stories and legends aside, this eclipse will be one of the longest and most fascinating total lunar eclipses of the last century. So, tonight, we encourage you all to lift your heads to the sky and take in this spectacular and unique event. Don't miss out. Or you'll be waiting 20 years for the next one. Hey, Joe, could you go any slower? I'm sick of being on this piece of junk. This piece of junk is four times your age, Reg. Oh, well, even better, an old piece of junk. Guys, guys, guys, guys. I've got a riddle. Brace yourselves. What follows us all day long behind... - Our shadow. - ...in the dark? Oh, intelligent screwed you over again. Hey, I got a riddle you won't find online. Let's hear it. Seven letters has my name. Being a tough guy is my game. Neither monsters, storms, nor dragons can stop me even without my weaponry. Now, ponder my words carefully. Virtue and nobility are nothing without fear. Even for the king of kings, him with the golden mane, he who thanks to me can live, roar, and reign. Who am I? Oh, you struggling, IQ. Do we... do we have to turn back now? Not necessarily. Everybody stay here. Oh, gross. Poor thing. It must have been run over. What the fuck is it? Oh. Should we help him? Nah. I bet it stinks. Yeah, like you after P.E. You are such a pig. Oink, oink. You know, I rode a pig once. Just pigs riding pigs, yeah? Anyway, I'm on this pig, massive. So, I was grabbing it by his ears and we started riding and all I hear the whole time... So, I'm riding it and there's a herd of them behind me also... - ...and then Chris... - A... a whole herd of them? A whole herd of them. And Chris' chick... Well, well, well, good evening. Sit down. Just stay calm, guys, okay? He's not going to hurt us. Wrong answer. From now on, you just sit down and you drive. I should be doing the talking from now on. Got that kids? I can't hear you. You got it? - Got it. - Got it. Good. Obedient, too. You, there. You... drive. It's him. That was him. Mark, he was trying to kiss her and she was screaming. So, I go, "Hey, leave her alone." And then he turns around with a stupid little face and goes, "Karl, the canteen's over that way." And he was with his friends, there was like seven of them. Yeah, but I bet that didn't scare you. Of course, it didn't. I slide tag with him and kick them straight in the balls, then I got up and hit the other one with a backhand strike. Yeah. The third managed to block me, but I kicked down the fourth and pushed the third on to the sixth. And the last one, well, attacked him with a super boost just like a real wrestler, letting chaos everywhere, KO, and the final kiss. - A super boost? - Mm-hmm. Just like that. Sorry. - Is that him? - Yes. We've been looking for this guy everywhere. We really have to find him before he claims other victims and eats more tongues. And I don't know what it is, but he just seems to love teenagers. We've got that super boost, right? Now, if you could all listen carefully, throw your fucking phones out the windows. You, too. - Fuck you. - Reg, do what he says. Sit. He's right, you know. No time for playing games. This gun is real. And I know what death tastes like. It tastes delicious. It's Pedro Minghella. The tongue eater. Who? The tongue eater. It's really, I'm just fucked up, eh. Prison can be a very informative experience. You should try it sometimes. Fuck. Good boy. Fucking things turned you all into zombies. Now, let's sit back and enjoy the journey, shall we? The night is long and the seas are rough. What's your name boy? - Uh, Nolan. Nolan. - Nolan? Nolan Parker. Nolan Parker. Sounds like something out of a comic book. I used to love comic books when I was a kid. First thing I ever stole, pack of smokes, comic book. I was obsessed. Shit. What's going on? You better not be fucking with me. I don't know, it just stopped. Well, get it fixed. You don't want me to lose my patience, do you? It won't start. It... it must be the motor. - Get here. - No, no, please, please, don't hurt me. Now, you get it fixed. One mistake, and her head goes boom. - Okay, okay, just calm down. - Calm down? I'm always calm. Get out. Okay. And that goes for you lot, too. He's going to kill us. He's going to kill us all. He's an absolute psycho. We need to disarm him. Yeah, I agree. But how? No, no, no, don't... don't try and be a hero now. He'll shoot you in the head without thinking twice. Yeah, Fat is right. For now, we just need to do nothing, all right? Wait for the right moment. God. Well? I don't know, it must be the engine. Get that thing out of here. I'll stay here with them. Oh, no, fuck! - Shut up! Shut up and sit down. - No, we need to go. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Sit down! - Oh, my God! Shut up and shut up and shut up! Let me fucking think. Oh, my God, you fucking psycho. Look at his mess. Just let us off. That's enough. I don't want to hear another one out of you. Do you understand? Fuck. Where the fuck are the keys? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! It's showtime. Go get the keys off that bastard. - Now! - Leave him alone, I'll go. Okay, move it. Bess, no! She makes one wrong move and I'll blow your brains out. Get it started. I'm not starting shit. I don't even know how to fucking drive. So, you're okay? And Joseph? Just do it. It was awful. It was like he'd been bitten by maybe an animal, like, I don't know. I don't know. Fuck. So? Make this thing move. Are you blind? I'm trying. And I'm trying to resist the urge to shoot you in the face. Oh, God. We need to do something. Well, if you do not get this pile of junk moving in the next 10 seconds, I'm going to shoot every one of your friends one at a time starting with four-eyes. Her name's IQ. This piece of junk belonged to my friend Joe. No, no, no! So, who's really fucking crazy now, eh? You haven't got the balls. I know that smell. It's the smell of a gutless little wonder trying to play the big man. If I were you, I'd shoot now before your friends all smell it too. I don't have any friends. It's here. I didn't escape from prison to die in a battle box like this. Come on, show your face. ♪ La, la, la, la ♪ Shh. Shh. Oh, shit. - Shit. Shit. Shit. - We are... we are doomed. - Come, Bess, come. - Fuck this! Fuck this! Fuck this! This is not happening. This is not happening. - Calm... down. - No, he fired. He could be dead as well. Yeah, we're all gonna be dead next, you know. Shut the fuck up. - Calm down! - We're trapped in a tunnel - and we're all going to die one by one. - Fuck. No, no, no, come on, there must be a logical explanation for all this. The only logical thing here is certainly this little whiny bitch. Reggie, stop, this isn't helping. Oh, all right, what the fuck are you going to do, huh? You're gonna fucking hit me or something? Let's just calm down, Reggie. Just stop it. You're not making things any easier. Fuck. Okay, oh, you got me. I'm... I'm scared shitless. They... they... they... they... they... they weren't... Those weren't hands. They weren't human. They definitely weren't. We need to get out of here now. Oh, please Lord, please. Okay, Reggie, you drive. Now, you're just making too much noise. Boys, that's it, we need to create a fucking pandemonium, idiot. Fucking damn it! A push won't fucking work. - Nothing is fucking working. - We just need to deal with this ourselves, okay? Yeah, if we all work as a team, we'll probably make it out of here alive. Fuck this. Fuck this. I don't need this. I just want to get off this fucking bus and go home. That is what we all want, Reggie. Reggie, come on. Reggie. You hear me? Reggie. You okay? I won't make a sound. Let go of me! Oh, God! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Come on, let's go. Go, go, go! - Hurry up, quickly! - Come on, come, come on. Hey, where are you going, Karl? What, would you rather turn back? Absolutely not. Okay, look, we just need to keep going, okay. Yeah. We'll find somewhere safe. We've got a better chance of getting out of here. Yeah. - Yup, this place is fucking terrifying. - Okay, just calm down. It's my worst nightmare. Fuck that. Fuck that. This way it is. What is this place? No idea, Queenie. Some kind of abyss? Yeah. Where are we? This is fucking hell. Let's get out of this. Guys, can we stop? I can't take it any longer. I'm exhausted too. Hold on. Yeah, okay, we can stay in here. Karl, shut the door behind you. Reggie. - Uh-huh? - Can we get these candles lit up? All right, boss. - Fuck you, dude. - Sorry. So that's the floor plan of this place. Yeah, looks like an old military fort. We need to find the control room and switch on the generator. I'll take every single one of you out to dinner if you can find one thing that works in this pit. Well, you better book us a table because Queenie's never wrong. Well, I would if I had my phone then. Josie would have gotten us out of here for sure. - Poor Joe. - Yeah. Um, you know he knew my dad? Yeah. They played in the Stormy Clouds together. Your dad played basketball? Yeah, small forward. It's the same hat as Joe's. Never seen your dad before. When did you last see him? Two years ago. It must be tough. They set him up. They were a patsy. He did nothing but he's the one doing time. - Well, that was your dad's? - Yeah. It's cool. - So, where are we? - Yeah. We should be right here. This place is huge. According to the floor plan, the control room is right there. And I think we should go check it out. - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll go. You're up. I'm going to stay here. I think I might stay here, too. Okay, look, Reggie, you stay here with them and I'll go with Nolan. Good luck. Don't you two have too much fun, yeah? All right, so the control room shouldn't be too far now. - What? - Nothing. It was just a mouse. You're saying? I was saying that the control room should be close. Okay. I said the control room should be near. So straight ahead, then right. Isn't it left? Yeah, sorry, I've got terrible sense of direction. Well, at least, you're really good at drawing. - You think? - Yeah. I saw your sketches on the bus, I thought they were amazing. Thanks. You know, my mom painted. Really? Cool. Like what sort of things? Just all sorts of landscapes. My favorite one is above my bed, it's this amazing beach with like the bluest sea and its really white sand. So, it's beautiful. Five, six, five, six, seven, eight... I'm so fucking hungry. Me, too. You know, I'd kill for a hamburger right now. I bet you would. With some fried eggs, jalapenos... ...double bacon, fries and a large drink. Look, man, we get that you're obese. Just shut up, yeah? And that counts for the noises, too. You're busting my fucking balls, bro. Shut up. - Guys. - Warming up. You're busting my fucking balls. - Guys. - Shut up. So, you do have them? - Fuck you. - Guys. - It was a joke. - Why do I fuck? Fuck you. Guys. - Guys! - What? I really need to pee. So, uh, who's coming with me? What is this? There's lights. You remember on the bus, that thing can't stand the light. Someone's already tried to kill it. It doesn't look like the plan worked out though. We need to find the main switchboard. - Here is good. - Sure. Turn around. Come on, you're not the first girl I've seen with the pants down. You are such an idiot. Turn around. I said turn around. Move away further. - Not too far though. - All right, all right. Just hurry up and piss, yeah? Let's get back to Karl. You know, you are kind of cute when you're mad though. Should piss you off more. Queenie, are you done? Queenie. Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Karl, they've got her. It should be in here somewhere. Here it is. Queenie! - It's all my fucking fault. - Check in her. - IQ! - IQ! Queenie! - Oh, shit, shit. IQ! - Queenie! Queenie! Queenie! Queenie? Oh! Queenie! Get the fuck off of her! Get the fuck off of her! Oh, my God! Run! Run! Run! It won't budge. Let me help you. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. Reggie. Reggie. Reg! Reggie. Reg! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Reg! They found the generator. We need to find them. "Your end, my beginning." "9th of February 2000." So, all we need to do now is find the entrance to this place. Oh, my God. Reggie went with Queenie who needed to wee. I stayed back but then Reggie came back without Queenie - and said she'd been taken by a bunch of... - Whoa, whoa, slow down, Karl, slow down. Calm down. I left her alone. It's my fault. I'll be all right. Shit. Look, guys, we need to fucking go. We can't. We need to show you something first. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to Giulio Sarpi. So, we're not the only people who've seen this thing. He was obsessed with it. He called it the Nocturne Wanderer. It killed his sister 40 years ago in this very place. Listen, "Isabelle and I loved going on adventures. We used to pretend we were explorers discovering faraway lands. And this evening was the perfect evening for an expedition. We knew the place by heart and our parents trusted us..." Isabelle and I loved going on adventures. We used to pretend we were explorers discovering faraway lands and this evening was the perfect evening for an expedition. We knew that place by heart and our parents trusted us. After all, nobody believes in the big, bad wolf until it crosses their path. It appeared before our eyes out of nowhere. It drew you into his lair and my life has never been the same again. And God said let there be light, and there was light. God looking on the light, saw that it was good and he made a division between the light and the dark. And it was in the darkness that I looked for you without ever finding you. You're the only nightmare that has haunted me for years, as elusive and real as the darkness. But I swear I will find you. I know how to trap you. And this time, you won't run away. Your end, my beginning. Shit. So, he went crazy. He was a desperate man. Yeah, he dedicated his entire life to finding out the truth about his sister. I mean he researched everything from theories, to scientific evidence, to even pictures. Our theories are right. It hates the light and lives in the darkness. Yeah, it feeds off of blood and liquids like a vampire or a leech. No. Like a parasite. Like a parasite. And now it's fed on IQ. It won't stop until it's finished. So, what's the plan? So, we have to stay. Stay and kill it. Finish the job Giulio Sarpi started. I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me. No one is getting left behind. We can only do this if are all together. Just like a team of superheroes. What would you say, Reg? I like being a superhero. If I see one spandex suit, I'm fucking out. Let's kill this. His end. Our beginning. Ready. Karl. Karl. What? Stop hitting. Stop what? Your hands. Come on, fucking wanderer. Come on! Fuck. Hey, come in here! Come on! Reggie, come on. Come on. I'm scared. So am I, IQ, but we'll make it out of here. Please don't... please don't leave me alone. I won't. I promise. Go, go. Go now! Come on, come on, come on, we've got to go. - Run! Come on! Hurry up! Quickly! - Come on! You can do it! Come on! Fight me now, you fucking piece of shit. For Joe. For Joe. Seven letters compose my name. Being a tough guy is my game. Neither monsters, storms, no dragons can stop me. Even if you strip me off my weaponry. Now, ponder my words carefully. Virtue and nobility are nothing without fear. Even for the king of kings... ...Him with the golden mane. He, who thanks to me... ...can live... - ...roar... - ...and reign. Courage. That was the answer to the riddle and the only word to describe what that ordeal taught us. What started as a simple shortcut turned out to be much more. No one believed our story or took us seriously. But it doesn't matter. What counts is us, our friendship, and that incredible truth that will stay with each of us for the rest of our lives.
