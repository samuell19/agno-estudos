Our very own sunshine boys, Morecambe and Wise - quite simply one of the best-loved comedy double acts in the history of television. Between 1968 and their final BBC show in 1977, the boys recorded 71 shows. And their final Christmas show brought in an audience of over 21 million. # Positive thinking helps you on the way, my friend # When things look black, try positive thinking... # I was lucky enough to have appeared with Morecambe and Wise a couple of times. I was one of those acrobatic sailors in that last Christmas show. But, long before that, I popped up in the very first BBC series in 1968. Most of those programmes are stored here at the BBC archive in West London. You'll notice I said that MOST of those shows are stored here. Well, unfortunately, the very first series that Eric and Ernie made for the BBC was lost. Actually, the Corporation wiped the tapes, and then reused them to make other programmes. But, by some miracle, two of those comedy spectaculars from the lost 1968 series survived, and have been rediscovered. The man who found them is television activist Philip Morris. He's a sort of Indiana Jones, travelling the world, tracking down the nation's lost TV heritage. Five years ago, he found nine lost episodes of Doctor Who. This year, he discovered some real comedy gems - episodes of Harry Worth, The Rag Trade and Citizen James. Hi, Michael. Hello, Philip. You're doing great work. One of the latest discoveries includes my first appearance with Morecambe and Wise 50 years ago. So this is one of our old programmes. And Philip has brought along the only surviving film copy. As I recall, we... we did it on video tape. This is... This is film. That's correct, Michael. Basically, BBC Enterprises, which was the commercial arm of the BBC, made film recordings of these original video tapes, and they were sent around the world for broadcast by overseas TV stations. And that is, luckily, how we have these today. Can we go and see it? Oh, we can. Come on, let's go. THEME TUNE PLAYS APPLAUSE Philip, where did you find this? This particular film was found in Sierra Leone... Sierra Leone? West Africa, of course. How did it get there? These particular films were sent out as what we call audition prints by BBC Enterprises, as kind of a taster - if you wanted to purchase a full series, they would send one or two prints out of that programme as an example for a purchase of a full series. Although you're seeing it now in its raw form, with the technology that we have today, at the end of this, the restored version, I think, you're going to be very pleased to see. So what drives you to do all of this kind of thing? It's national heritage. And something like Morecambe and Wise, I mean, they're an institution. This is just a complete pleasure for me. You know, I just don't see how I could not. Is there a lot more out there? That's something I can't give a definitive answer to, for the simple reason that no paperwork exists. But I believe there is, yes. And I'm still looking, still searching, so... ..we could be sitting here next year. Right, you'll like this, Michael. Here comes your bit. I hope so. MUSIC PLAYS THEY LAUGH What's going on here? Hold it, hold it, hold it! And in this, you can! Hold it! These aren't the steps that I rehearsed. This strikes me, and it struck me at the time, that if you're a kind of straight guest, you don't try and be funny in the company of pros. Right. But it was a little walk-off I did earlier in the show, and actually I sort of just ad libbed that, and I thought afterwards, "Eric's going to come up "and grab me by the lapel to say, 'Sunshine, you don't do that.'" But he never said a word. They were very kind to their guests. It was the most marvellous experience. He can't move now. He's paralysed. Aren't you? Well, Philip, all I can say is thank you very much for all you're doing - you're bringing sunshine back into a lot of people's lives. Michael, thank you. It's such a pleasure to bring it back into yours, too. For sharing this with me, I'm truly humbled, thank you. And now, for the first time in half a century, renewed, and in colour, The Morecambe And Wise Show. Also starring me. APPLAUSE Good evening. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Ernie Wise Show. I suppose you're wondering why I said that. What's happened is we've lost Eric, we don't know what happened - we haven't seen him for a week. He left last week, and we've never seen him since. There's been a panic back here. So I'm going to do the show by myself. So, first of all, I'd like to sing a song that I made famous many years ago when I was Flanagan and Allen. # Run, rabbit Run, rabbit, run, run, run # Run, rabbit Run, rabbit, run, run, run... # LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE # Bang, bang, bang Goes the farmer's gun # So run, rabbit Run, rabbit, run, run, run... # Thank you, you like it? It's good, isn't it? Yeah... # Run, rab... # Just a... Where have you been?! Don't stop. That was amazing. Not clever, not good, but amazing. How a man of your age can go so far back. To me, that deserves a round. Buy everybody a round, I dare you. Where have you been?! Get off. Thanks for the lift. Eh? I said, where have you been? Where have I been? It's obvious where I've been. You've been to Butlin's. Butlin's?! LAUGHING: Yes. LAUGHING: I haven't. I've just come back from sailing round the world in an open boat. I did it for a knighthood. And if a certain person happens to be looking in, who hands 'em out - ready when you are! APPLAUSE You've been sailing around the world? Oh, you heard? You can keep nothing secret in this place. Two of my suits have gone already. Don't you kid me. You've been dodging rehearsals, haven't you? I've been sailing around the world, I had to. Why? Because I had a row with the wife. Ah, now the truth's coming out. You had a row with the wife, eh? Yes. She said to me, "Why don't you get knighted?" "Why don't you get knighted"? It sounded like that. What do you want a knighthood for anyway? Because I want to be known as Sir Eric, and I want my wife to be known... ..as Lady Eric. What about me? All right, you can be Lady Eric, I'm easy. Doesn't bother me. Look, you're just using this as an excuse. Excuse?! You're kidding us. She'll never give you a knighthood, don't be ridiculous. Well, why not? Already I've got my MBE, haven't I? I've got that. You've got an MBE? I've had that for years. I didn't know that. Spell my second name, spell it. M-O-R-E-C... ..A MBE. Thank you. APPLAUSE Look, you're just covering up, that's all. This is a lot of lies, and I don't believe one word. What's that? What's that? It's a fish. Thank you. Well, that doesn't prove anything. What's that? Look at that. That's another. Scott's Emulsion. From the Emulsion Islands. Listen, I want more proof... Get up! Has she done it? I didn't feel a thing. Am I now Sir Eric? No. Just a moment. Yes? I want more proof than that. More proof? Have you got any pictures? That's a picture of me rounding the Horn last Thursday at four o'clock in the afternoon. HE WHISTLES I thought you were supposed to be alone. I am alone, completely and utterly alone. Then what's that girl there in that bikini doing, up there at the front of the boat? Ah. Yes. That's a figurehead. Figurehead? Yes, they all have them - figureheads on the mast. And why is she standing like that? She was frightened to death of me, I don't know why. There was a heavy swell. It's impossible to sail round the world in one week, and you know it. I know a short cut. There is no short cut! There was a strong wind? No! Listen, if you'd have sailed round the world, I'd have read about it in the papers when you landed at Plymouth Hoe. I didn't land at Plymouth Hoe, big mouth! I landed at Heathrow. That's an airport. I told you it was a strong wind. It's murder with those Boeings - you don't know where they're going. Look, I don't believe... And what is this thing you've got? What's this thing here? What sort of fish is that, then? Look. It's not off a flat one, is it? That's for sure. No. That's my hammock, that. There's many a happy hour I've spent in there. Look, I'll tell you where you've been. Getting permission for that. No! You've been up the Thames. Up the Thames? ..with Boo-Boo. It's all lies, lies! That lovely girl. Shut up, shut up. And you're using this as an excuse. Get off! The wig's showing! Get off. I'll tell you something else, if your wife finds out, there'll be murder. She'll never find out, unless some fella tells her. She'll never find out, eh? No. Well, you just turn round. Hello, darling. Just come back from round the world. One more for luck, love. Go on. Good girl. I didn't realise my wife could give you a knighthood. She did better than that - she crowned you. King Eric, I like it. What's for supper tonight? It's not fish, is it? Eh? Not in that hat. Lovely. APPLAUSE # I look at you # And suddenly # Something in your eyes I see # Soon begins bewitching me # It's that old devil moon # That you stole from the skies # It's that old devil moon in your eyes # You and you glance make this romance # Too hot to handle # Stars in the night # Blazing their light # Can't hold a candle # To your razzle-dazzle # You've got me flyin' high and wide # I'm on a magic carpet ride # I'm full of butterflies inside # Wanna cry, wanna croon # Want to laugh, laugh, laugh like a loon # It's that old devil moon in your eyes # Just when I think I'm free as a dove # Just when I think I'm free as a dove # Old devil moon # Deep in your eyes # Blinds me with # Love, love, love # Love, love! # APPLAUSE Morning, boys. Morning, Ern. Morning, Ern. Mail's just arrived. Oh, yeah? Why is it these days you always seem to get bills, brochures and fourpence off? I don't know. Drives you mad. Morecambe and Wise. Morecambe and Wise. Morecambe and Wise. Wise and Morecambe. Wise and Morecambe?! Must have his TV set around the wrong way. Morecambe and Wise. Mr Eric Morecambe. Mor... Mr Eric Morecambe? What's he doing getting a letter all to himself? And it's from Liverpool. Who does he know in Liverpool? Nobody. I don't know. We'll soon find out, anyway. Oi! What? You're not opening his private mail, are you? Only for a little while. It's not as if it's permanent, you know. That's all right, then. Now let's see what we've got in here. Wait a minute, look at this. It's full of postal orders. Oh? He's got 50 quid's worth a postal orders in there. He must've won the pools! How much? 50 quid's worth, look at that. 50 quid? 50 quid? Eh? Now the question is, are we going to pinch it off him, or are we going to con him out of it? You can't pinch it, that's illegal. All right, we'll con it out of him, OK? Right. Fair enough. What's that? It's the sticky tape, I always keep it in there when I open his letters, you know. Oh. There we are. Wait a minute. Got a pen here. Opened... ..in... ..error. "Opened in error"? Yeah. Well, he made a mistake letting me get to it first, didn't he? How do you propose to get this 50 quid off him? How do I propose to do that? It's simple, isn't it, fellas? Just go along with whatever I do. I mean, he's pretty gullible anyway, isn't he? All right. I mean, it will be good practice for me. I should do fine. Look out, watch it. Here he is. Good morning, boys. ALL: Morning, Eric. HE COUGHS Oh, the first one's murder, isn't it? Oh, any mail for me? Anything for me at all? No, were you expecting...? No, no, just wondered if there was anything for me. I ask that every morning, there's nothing for me. There is a letter for you, I think. Oh, is there? Is that it? Mm. Typical Post Office, that, isn't it? What do you mean typical...? Typical, that. I get a letter from Liverpool, all the way from Ireland. What do you mean all the way from Ireland? "Opened in Eire," it says. APPLAUSE Pure Post Office, that. HE WHIMPERS EXCITEDLY What? What? What was that? Nothing, nothing. Any crispy bacon left? Crispy bacon. Who's it from? What, the crispy bacon? No, the letter. Oh, from a friend. In Liverpool? Yes. Who do you know in Liverpool? The Beatles. You've had a letter from the Beatles? Oh yes, yes. The Beatles don't know you. No. They say that in the letter. It says, "Dear Eric, we don't know you, "The Beatles." Oh, that's hot. Well, Sid and Dick, I don't care what you say, I bet I can even if you bet I can't. Any coffee? We bet you can't. I'll bet you I can. You can't. Do you want to make it a fiver? Fiver you can't. All right, fair enough, a fiver says I can, and you say I can't. Tell them what, Ern? Well, it's no good asking you, is it? You'd say I couldn't even if I could. Could what? You're never on my side, you're always on their side. What are you talking about? I have to be on your side, haven't I? Didn't I promise your mother I'd look after you? Didn't I? Well, I say I can, and they say I can't. Bet you can't. If he says he can, he can, and that's it, final. Are you going to bet a fiver on that? A fiver says he can. Well, I can't. See? You owe them a fiver. LAUGHTER What was the bet? The bet? Oh, well, they bet me that I couldn't swim the Channel with my hands tied behind my back. And you took it? Absolutely. You fool. You can't even swim! I'd forgotten about that. There you are... Pay up! All right. Fiver. a bet. Five quid each. Do you mind postal orders? Did you say that was a letter from The Beatles? Yes. They don't write on paper now. They write on those things. Got a fortune, they don't know what to do with it. They should send it to me. Well, I must say, Dick, that's a very fine gesture you're making. Is Dick going to make a gesture? For what? Do you know what Dick is going to do? What are you going to do, Dick? Well, I'll tell you. Why can't he tell me? He doesn't know yet. Will you pass the blacked out sauce? Dick... Will you pass the blacked out sauce, please? Spelt backwards it is. Dick is going to give his fiver to Sid for his poor Auntie Ethel. That's what I'm going to do, yes. Auntie Ethel. Auntie Ethel? Lovely that. You see, Sid was going to give his fiver to his poor Auntie Ethel, and now Dick has doubled it. Yes, to my aunt Ethel. That's a good gesture, that, Dick. Thank you very much. Nice gesture, that. It's all right. Lovely. What's the matter with your Auntie Ethel? She's having a baby... ..a poodle. She wants a poodle. She's having a baby. She wants a poodle, and she's having a baby. How very disappointing for her. It's her 17th. Poodle? Baby. That's a relief. She's had 16, and now she's having another. Only this time, she'd like a poodle. Well, she can't win them all, can she? But I can tell her to keep trying. They can do miracles nowadays, miracles. Wouldn't you like to make...? The sauce is off. Wouldn't you like to make a gesture, Eric? There is a gesture I would like to make... That's very generous of you. I haven't done it yet. I know what you're going to do. You're going to double it, aren't you? Double what? My fiver... &#163;5. For my aunt Ethel. That's very nice of you. That's very nice of you. Would your auntie like a letter from The Beatles? It's double that, isn't it? He doubled it. was a five and a five, that's ten, he wants another five. It's a good job The Beatles write long letters, isn't it? I'm very proud of you, that's a very nice gesture. Lovely, yes, cheers. Sid's auntie will be very pleased about that. I'm sure she will. Oh me leg! Oh me leg! Me leg's gone! Now don't panic anybody, it can't be very far. APPLAUSE I think I've broken my leg. Broken it? Yes, I've broken it. You'll have to just manage without me. Yes, I'm sure we'll be able to. It was the other one a minute ago. I've broken both me legs. Both your legs? That's clever. It'll mean a loss of earnings, won't it. Yes, you'll have to claim. I'll settle out of court. Settle what out of court? What are you talking about? My claim against you. What have I done? Well, it's your carpet isn't it? It's your place. Your flat. I definitely saw you push him. You pushed me. I never touched him. I was halfway through a sausage. You pushed him. I witnessed it. He witnessed it. This will cost you &#163;10,000. 10,000... Look, I've got 30 quid, that's all I've got. That'll do. That's a hell of a drop from 10,000 down to 30 isn't it? Ah, just shows you the wisdom of settling out of court, doesn't it? You rotten devils you. What do you mean? You knew I'd won a little bit of money on the pools. Have you? You're getting more like The Andrews Sisters every day! You know damn well I have, and you've conned it out of me. An ill will befall all of you one of these days. I'd have given you a fiver each. What do we want a fiver for? We got it all, didn't we. Shut up and get out. Rotten devils. What's that? Come in. What do you want? Excuse me, mister, can you spare a sixpence? Sixpence, what for? Mummy's in hospital. And we want to buy her some flowers. Can't your daddy buy her some flowers? Daddy's... Daddy's gone and we're all alone and mummy's the only one, without any flowers. Here you are, kids. Give me that money here. You go out and buy your mummy some flowers and some chocolate, anything her heart desires. Ooh, thank you, mister, you're a sport. It's OK, kid. I'm proud of you. Proud. It's all right. Of the three of you. Aren't you going to give them something? I've got nothing. What can I give them? Here, give them this five bob. Lovely, thank you. I'm proud of you, boys, I really am. Thrilled. Did we do it right, mister? Great, half a crown each, give us the money. Out, go on, out! # Just because my hair is curly # Hair is curly # Just because my cheeks are burly # Well because I always # Always wear a smile # I like to dress up, yes # Because # I like to face all my troubles # With a big smile # Just because she's a lady # I don't mean maybe, baby # That's why they call me shine # Shine, my hair is curly # Oh, shine, shine, shine, my teeth are pearly # Well because I always, always wear a smile # Like... # All the latest style because... # I like to face all my troubles, yeah, with a big smile # Just because she's a lady # I don't mean maybe, baby # That's why they call me, yes, shine # My hair is curly # My teeth are pearly # Well because I always, always # Wear a smile HE SCATS # Just because # And I don't mean maybe, baby # That's why they call me shine... # Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of the show, we'd like to say a big thank you to Kenny Ball and his Jazz Men. What you doing? Just saying goodnight to everybody, that's the end of the show. It's early yet, there's another 10 or 15 minutes to do, yet. No, I'm afraid it's all over, it's finished you see. Aren't we doing, you know, the musical that we usually do? The musical? The vintage years of Cricklewood? That's Hollywood. I've only been to Cricklewood. No, as a matter-of-fact we haven't got a guest star on the show tonight so we can't do it. Oh. So the only thing we can do is just say, "Goodnight, everybody," and go, you see. Your hat and coat's there in the wings and the taxi's waiting for you outside. Oh. Off you go. Fine. What I was going to say, if we're not doing it, why are you dressed like this then? Oh, I'm going out to eat afterwards. Oh, I see. No the buffet at King's Cross Station. It's the in place. That's not the in place, what you talking about? It's the only place they'll let me in. Well, if we have to leave on a laugh, it might as well be that one. All we got to do is just start the music. Bye-bye folks. Say goodnight. Bye-bye. It's early though. Hope you've enjoyed the show. Bye-bye. I'll see you at home. OK, I'll see you... Cheerio, off you go. Don't waste any time now. WHISPERS: Stop the music, stop the music. Stop. Has he gone? OK, he's gone. Thank goodness, now we can do a musical right for the first time. Actually we have got a guest star, ladies and gentlemen, so let's go on with the Hollywood musical. Music! And our musical tonight is an all singing dancing musical and here is our all singing dancing guest star, Mr Michael Aspel. Michael. It's wonderful to have you on the show and I know you're going to be absolutely brilliant in this part. I think you're probably right. Thank you very much indeed. You did promise me, didn't you, Ernie, there would be no interruptions from You Know Who during this sketch. Don't worry about him. I told him the show was over, and he's gone home. That's a great relief. Not that I have anything personal against Eric, you understand. Why not? Perhaps you're right. He has no sense of rhythm, does he? Not much. The thing is, it's very important to me because I've been practising for months this routine between news flashes and in fact that's why they asked me to leave. I see, yes. Well, don't you worry, you're going to be fabulous. Thank you very much. In this part you play the part of Chuck Wagon, the leading man. Yes. And all I want you to do now is wait in the wings and I'll call you on when I'm ready for you. Thank you very much. OK. Oh, I like this. Oh, I say! How can you compete against that? Our scene opens where Goldie, Chuck's dancing partner, has left him. He's absolutely desperate and he's decided to end it all. Without Goldie, I'm a flop. Why don't I end it all? Chuck, don't jump. I've got a great new number for you, a number that's going to make you into a big Broadway star. Play that record. You rotten dog. You told me there was no musical. Is this on the record? No. You've got a guest star as well. You've got Michael Aspirin. Michael Aspel! He gives me a headache whoever he is. Robert Dougall. Shut up! Get rid of him. Reginald Bosanquet. Don't worry about that. Get off! Now listen, Chuck, this is going to be a great number that you're going to do. Now you just do what I do. It goes like this. # For I'll be there... # Yes. # Putting on my top hat... # Yes, I like that. # Tying up my white tie... # Yes, it's good, it's original. # Brushing off my tail # Putting on my top hat # Tying up my white tie # Brushing off my tail... # Chuck, that was fabulous. It's a great number. Rotten! Rotten! Don't take any notice, Chuck. But I'm no good without Goldie. What do you mean, you're no good without Goldie? Listen, leave it to me, Chuck, I'll find another partner for you, somebody who dances even better than Goldie. It'll never be the same without Goldie. Oh, come on, smile. That's my boy. Leave everything to me, I'll sort it all out. Hey, Maisie! What? Come here. Now listen you, I've just had it out with Michael Aspel. You'll do anything for a laugh. Yes, Mr Glockenheimer? And it's done your voice no good either. Will you go home! Those aren't the lines. So why am I saying them? Listen, you said you could dance eh? That's true. OK, let's see you dance. Certainly. Hey, that's pretty good. You like it? Lovely. And you've got such lovely legs. Cheeky! Tell me, what are you like with a partner? Try me. A bit thin but we'll have a go. Where you going? Go on, get out of it, will you? You told me there was no musical. This all happened by accident. Accident? Yes. How can you know it so well? We're making it up as we go along. You know it very well for somebody who's making it up as they go along. We got to get rid of this guy. Just do as I do. Am I in it? One, two, three, four. Maisie. You are fabulous, why you dance better than Goldie! You just go and put on a top hat and black tights, this is your big chance, baby. Oh, thank you, Mr Glockenheimer. Don't forget what you promised. Hey, Chuck! Come here. Here. Chuck, smile. Listen, I've got a great new partner for you, a girl who dances better than Goldie, she dances like a dream. Better than Goldie? Better than Goldie. What's her name? It's a beautiful name, it has a ring to it, you know. I think this could work. We could go back to that old routine, do you remember, when she comes in from the wings? That's right. In the middle of the picture she leaves you, then joins you at the end, for the big finale song. And everyone cries. That's right. I was rather good in that. He was, he was rather good. Come on, let's go into the number. Let's have the music. That's my boy! And here comes Maisie now! What's going on here? Hold it, hold it, hold it. And in this you can! Hold it. These aren't the steps I rehearsed. He's a fine actor, this fella. Oh, yes. A fine actor. Who is this anyway? Who is this anyway? This is no anyway, this is me, Maisie. Listen, don't let's have a misunderstanding, I didn't want you out of the musical completely, because I am honestly one of your greatest fans. You see, I should have been in this. I love the routines that you do, so much, that little thing you do with Ernie when you say, "Get out of that." I do that a lot with him. I say, "Get out of that", to him. He can't move now, he's paralysed. Aren't you? Tell him you can't move. I can't move. He can't move. What about the one where you play around with his wig? Pardon? His wig. What, that one? Yes. Where I say, "You can't see the join." Yes. Another new one? Yes. Make a fortune in this series. Then there's the... Carpet I'm using. The glasses, I love too. Oh, I do that. I do that. I go off and I can't get the glasses in the pocket. You see, I can't see and I do that, pull it out like that and put them in. I like that one. One of my favourites - what's your first name? Michael. One of my favourites is when I go like this. What do you think of that? I don't really care for that one. Oh, pity that. He doesn't like when I go like that. I don't go much on it myself. Eric, please, do me a favour, will you? Certainly. Will you do my favourite one of all? You see, what's that? Get off. Oh. That's the best line you've said in the play. Wait a minute, where's Maisie? I'm here, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here. He keeps pushing me around. It gets more like a Jewish wedding every day. Get rid of him once and for all. Now give me a hand. Get out of there. Get him out the way. Sorry about that, Maisie. Here we go now. One, two... A one, two. A one, two, three... Ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of the show, we'd just like to say goodnight. No, Boo-boo comes on now and takes all her clothes off. But she's already taken all her clothes off. Oh, that's true. All she's got to do is to stand up. Stand up, Boo. Give us all a laugh. Boo? Boo? Mike, let Boo stand up, will you? Mike! Is he going to read the news? I think he's making the news down there. That's the best news flash I've ever seen that. Really? Mike!
