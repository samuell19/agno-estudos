You live here, moreso. To be the continue. Hmm... (Choir singing - break every chain) (singing) Hallelujah I know you didn’t come here today to hear any sermon. We are here to talk about building ... Lasting relationship But God has dropped a word in my heart. There's a young man and lady here. You're madly in love with each other. As a matter of fact, You almost did not make dor this program today. But God has arrange it for you to be here this time. You see, your relationship was designed by God. It's a beautiful thing. But, by your own doing, You're allowing the Devil to adulterate that which he has made beautiful. You're defying... The marriage bed. If you don’t understand what i am saying, I mean, That you're sexually involved with one another, even though you're not married. Listen to me, the bible says, Now, you break the edge, The serpent will strike. The hedge has been broken and there's nothing I can do for you. But there's power in the name of Jesus. To change our situation. If you'll give him a chance. If you allow the Lord, He will build a bridge. Over the hedge That has been broken. He will save you. From the plan of the enermy. If you fall in that category of persons i'm talking about, I want you to please, come forward. Embrass this opportunity. Embrass this opportunity. To receive salvation. The Lord is waiting for you. Hallelujah. Yes. He says, call on me now. Now, that I can be found. (laugh) While in no time, utter darkness, utter dakness, I'll call upon you. You'll look for me but not find me. Come forward now. What happens now? Nothing. Just... stop having, sex. Okay. Do you think it is possible? Babe. I'm with you because I love you. I've loved you since, high school. Sex has nothing, To do with it. Are we allowed to do that? The preacher said sex. And the way I see these things, Build a relationship with God, He takes care of every other thing. So, working in his house, Leads to a better relationship. That's what the preacher said. Don't Worry. We won't become fanatics. Yet, Not yet. I'm done. How do we know the sex is tired to the dream? And the preacher, how do you know that he was talking about us? We don't even know who he is. I can't do this, Ace! I can't do any of this! Chizzy... We were happy. We were happy before we went there. And now, our plans... Our plans are just... Done! No. No. No. Chizzy, Our plans are still intact. No... Please, I'm scared, something is going to happen. I'm scared, i'm going to lose you. No, no. I can't do it! All of these religious things, I can't do it! Chizzy, Chizzy. I won't fail you. I won't fail us. I don't know what i'm doing. Look at me. I love you. I dont want to do any of this. Hey! Obi, Obi! Manage, the little piece of chicken. My brother, my link to wealth. Exciting times! I can't belive you're here. It is so. NYSC has brought us together. Don't worry The way you are my link to wealth, I am your link to happiness here. I'll take care of you. There is condition, As your sister, You'll share your, your stipend with me. Understand? Is that all? Yes. You'll take care of your sister. You can have it. What? You can have it. Really? Okay.

I'll be going now. (inaudible) I'll come back some other time. Obi, wait. Sit down. Your friend needs you. It's okay, just sit down. I'll come back next week. -Really? -Yes. Next week? Okay. Later. Chizzy? Chizzy, stop it! Don't use your problem to spoil my good luck. What is the problem!? What's your problem? You just used your problem to drive my cousin away... That wanted to give me money. What? Chizzy? My sister... What is the problem? Did you have a fight with Ace? No... God... Did Ace hit you? I should be happy. I don't know what is wrong with me? What happened? Enough. Talk to "Vivy-large", i will do my best to fix it. A..., Ace and I are... ...Are reborn, or B.., born again. Whatever these people call it. You're what? Born again. "Vivy-large", you've now seen everything in this campus. It's okay. Ask your roommate. Chizzy? Ace has been having these dreams, Ever since i can remember. We went to the... A relationship seminar, and Since then, everthing is messed up! What? I don't understand. What? The preacher said that, God was angry with us because... we're having sex before marriage. What nonsense! Stop it. How did he know you people were having sex? That's the thing... When the... revelation... or prophesy... That thing that they do, They called us and we went up... But then, a lot of people were... but the majority of the people went up as well. Did I not say it? I don't like all these seeing churches. These pastors that claim to be seeing, They see for other people but don't see for themselves. Wait, let me ask you, The choir members also came out, right? It's alright. I don't understand, what does having sex have to do with Ace's nightmares? They said it triggers it. That everything is connected. The sex triggers the dream. What? It's from God! God, this is wonderful! Please, nobody should tell me that nonsense again. What do you mean? So, Because of that... Ace kicked you out? No, We agreed that, it was better for us... to just... Try... just... leave apart Chizzy, i don't know why you're crying. As far as I'm concern, this is good news. It means God knows about the two of you. And he wants the best for you. And, You should really be happy because most people wants to be born again. Whoa! Pastor Helen! Alright, start preaching. (inaudible) Be quiet. It is you that... I'll slap... Just respect yourself! What nonsense! I should not say what i feel? See, If that's why asked you to leave his house, forget it, that boy has other plans. What, Vivan? -I'm telling you. -What is wrong with you? How can you say that? He pledged his love to me. Really? Everything still stands. Stop it! I'm sure that boy has other plans. -I'm telling... -Vivian! Be quiet! How can you say something like that? Shut up, and let me speak! Wait, Did he take the ring. See, i don't trust that boy! If you are here crying, Is he crying in his house? There's something going on. - Pastor Helen... - Vivian? Stop it! Stop it. Chizzy, please ignore Vivian. She is stupid girl. Don't mind her. Okay, Chizzy stop crying. Let me give you rice. - Just lay done - I cook rice You'll feel better. It's okay, you'll feel better. Sorry darling Don't listen to Vivian, Vivian, stop. It's okay. Helen, mind yourself this afternoon. I don't like this rubbish. What is that? Sorry. Thank you. My friend, Have you lost your mind? Even if you wanted to break-up, Why not look for some other reason? Is there anything wrong with a couple doing the honorable thing? Shut up! There's nothing honorable about this! And you sent her parking? For the uptime time, I didn't send her packing precisely. This is a disaster! - Jesus! - Do you understand? No more food in this house. No free food today. Shut up! Just, shut up! My friend, So... em, She is okay with it, right? Answer me. She's Cool, right? What's wrong with you? My friend, Have you lost your mind! What's wrong with you!? Just like that? Izu, She wasn't too happy but she understands that... Since we are born again, My friend, Which born again? It doesn't suit you. My friend, See, I don't understand this crap you're into. But do you understand what this could do to your relationship? Do you understand? I know what i am doing. Okay. Fine. My friend, You're either the wisest man on earth, Or the biggest fool alive! Do you understand? He is the biggest fool. What is annoying to me us, There is no food at all. Hello. Hi. Are you Okay? Sincerely, I don't know. They said, when you accept the Lord, everything becomes right, Why is everything in disarray? I was happy. Oh, That feeling. I don't understand these whole God, born again thing. Ah! Tell me about it because I don't. You're joking, right? No. I think in man's quest to find God, they complicated things. Exactly! I learnt the ard way that, God is beyond what any man can tell you God is. To one man, He is fire. And to another, ...Water. Let me guess, Your major is philosophy? No. Medicine. My point is that, You've to find God yourself. Man has to just introduce him to you. You, have to find him yourself. How? Talk to him. Read books about him and how he helped other people. There's also the option of joining bible study group. Let me guess, are you in the bible study unit? My name is Akinola Cole Eniola. My friends call me Ace. I know. It's alright, bye. See you, next week Bye. See you at the next bible study. Ace. So, I think you're born for this. Your understanding of the scripture was so profound. What can i say? I've a profound teacher.

I've a lot of catching up to do myself So, there're some questions i've been meaning to ask you, Is... is kissing allowed in relationship? Hmm, that's a tough one.

Okay so, If Ace was any other guy, I'll say that he was... Cheating on me or maybe he was avoiding me or something, But this is Ace we are talking about. Chizzy, my sister, That's your mind telling you what your heart doesn't want to hear. Do you understand? What is that suppose to mean? Oh ladies! Women! Ladies, we like to lie to ourselves. See ehn, Once he has had sex, He cannot do without it. Is Ace cheating on me... or Is Ace not cheating on me But it's Ace! Listen. If he is not having sex with you, He's having sex with someone else. Someone else is servicing his "pipes"! No. He is having sex with someone else! Enough, Vivian common now. You said what? Please, don't patronize me! What is common? I'm telling her the truth.

See, we Ladies, Let me tell you, I've got experience. Let me not say ladies. Young girls like you and I, Because, the younger ones we've staying power. We can resist. We can resist for weeks. Months, years sometimes But men? Two weeks, they are dead! It's in their boold. It's how God created their menstral circle. So, You know, They can't help it. See, Obi's laughter confirms it. Please. Please. Please, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm still a virgin. Please, get away! what do you mean? What's that? Alright, see, You might have a point, but, Listen to me, Chizzy, I need you to keep the faith in your man. At least somebody here is being reasonable. Really? Yea, but honsetly, I'll advice you to follow your instincts. Trust them. Because your instinct is power. - My instincts? - Well said! They malfunctions when it comes to Ace. I should call it lover's interference. Or something. Ah, right there, The stars are back. Where? Your eyes. Look, You look hungry, so, Let me buy you dinner. Actually, I was told you just got back.

Chizzy, Where do I begin? Where do you begin? I hope the both of you are happy? Did you get the note I dropped explaining what happened? I didn't get you stupid note, Ace! I didn't read it. I burnt it! Just as I hope you and Shade burn! Chizzy, Heaven knows I'll never do anything to hurt you. Really? you cheated on me! Baby, I didn’t cheat. So you, want to keep that stupid lie? Chizzy, just remember all the promises I made. All of those promises are just... lies, Ace. They're all lies, Ace. Each and every single one of them, just as you are a liar! Each and every single one of them, just as you are a liar! That's what you are. That's what you are. Chizzy, just... Don't touch me. If you touch me, I'll just slap you. Now get out. I am not leaving until you hear me out. Fine, then stay. Fine go ahead and talk. C'mon Ace, leave me alone. Chizzy, just... I want to say I'm sorry. -- I love you and I always will. I don't care. I don't love you... Ace. I don't care I hate you. Take your stupid ring with you. Get out of my room! It's okay. You’ll be fine okay. It's okay. Ace just almost pushed me over. What happened? What is it? Chizzy, my sister, Did I not say it? Vivy-large said it. Ace. Ace. How are you? My friend. You got us really worried. What happened? My friend, one minute we are fighting in the club, the next.... You were lying down lifeless. You made me start praying to God. What did you tell God? I told God, If you got healed, I'll become born again. I'll give my life to Christ. Now, that I'm not dead? My friend, Me and God will decide. We have an agreement. Izu, how are you? Ace. What happened? I'm sorry, my friends. Got really confused about Chizzy. Ace, I know... That's not enough reason to grab another man's girl in the club. It's wrong. I'm sorry, my friends. Hello Ace. Hello pastor Sam, Greeting Doctor. Good day sirs. See you later. Thanks guys... Thanks again. Thank you sir. Cheers. Do you want to talk about it? About what exactly? About what's eating you up. What's eating me up? You church folks, don't just get it. You come with your do's and don'ts and you are asking me what's eating me up? What's eating me up is that, God has ruined a perfectly good relationship. So, What if we were having sex? What's wrong with that? I was going to marry that girl. I can understand your anger. You can.... You can understand my anger? You church guys can be so annoying. What is love, Ace? What? Love is.... A... Love is when, Why didn't you carry the woman you claim you love along... In your journey? What? When you... You were looking for God, You had a hunger for Him, there was a yearning. For in your heart, you were in search of Him. Why didn't you carry the woman you claim you love... Along? I don't know. Correct me, if I am wrong. You've been spending more time with Shade lately. Why? Why... If I tell you I'm not sure, you'll understand. Try me. I love Chizzy. I know you love her. It's why I'm confused, Why you haven't been spending much time with her. The thing is, Anytime, I'm... Anytime, I'm near her, You know... I don't know. I'm trying to say that... anytime I'm near her... I, I want to grab her. Is that what you thought I would not understand? Now, let me tell you something. Ace, every man battles with his hormones. His feelings, really. We all have it. Even pastors. I think pastors even have it worse these days. How do you handle these feelings? Hmm... In my opinion, the truest expression of love, is not marriage. It's honor. It's, honoring her. In every way. And how do you honor her? By preserving her dignity, her self respect. How do you preserve her honor, dignity? By not seeing her mainly as a sex object. You know, that is the truest and highest expression of love. In my opinion. You know, Ace we live in a very unfair world. I've seen everything. A man has sex with a woman, The woman is called a whore. or kinds of nasty names, The man is hailed. Hail a champion. The one who has conquered something. So, How I deal with my feelings? Is by thinking first, About her honor. I don't know what the deal with you and God is. You both have to figure that out for yourself. But remember, He called you both out in a meeting. Specially. That's... Cool. I think that's really special. What do I do now and how do I get her back? This is interesting. Well, as a man of God, As a pastor, I'd say, Find God first. When you find God, You'll find everything else. Man to man though, Actually, want to turn the question around and ask you. I will defer to you, ask your counsel. because you seem to be a mystero in something I'm ignorant of. Ignorant in. Because you are pretty much a counsellor now. You succeeded in getting two women to fall in love with you. When I can't get one to fall in love with me in four years. Pastor, You're in love? With who? With Shade. Since you became born again, things have become a mess for everyone. It's the truth now. So, my friend, What's up with you and... Chizzy? I could help you talk to her. The fact that I made her feel that way is an indication I couldn't protect her emotionally. And that is just... wrong. Anyway, I have been waiting on God and... He hasn't said anything. My friend, Chizzy is an amazing girl. And she is a great cook. Chizzy can cook. It's true. My friend, my point is Chizzy is the real deal. Any guy will be lucky to have that girl. I feel you my friend, but the right guy at the wrong time is still the wrong thing. Right now, I don't just feel right for her. Wait, are you saying you're just going to let her go? Just like that? No, I'm saying that I have been waiting on God... and He hasn't said anything. My friend, since you're waiting on God, can I try my luck with her? You are a cow. Vivy-large, Is Chizzy here? Who wants to know? Hello. Sorry, please where is Chizzy? Chizzy is out. She went clubbing with my cousin, Obi. Yes. Oh, I see. They went clubbing. Chi... Welcome. Hi Chizzy, Hey, My brother.

What makes you think I'm not fighting? Because you've gone stealth mood. Girls love to be fought for. I’m fighting Shade. Not the way many would expect me to fight. I’m sorry I messed things up for you. All things are working together. So, how are you fighting for her? With the father. Really? And, What is he saying? Nothing yet. Typical.

I'm not married yet. You'll be. And you'll be very happy. Thank you. What about you? I'll be fine. I go that way. - Take care. - You too. (inaudible) Who is it?

Think about him and let me know, right? Obi, let me... It's fine. It's fine, love. You're angry with... I'm not. I'm not angry. Alright, it's fine. Vivy-large... What happened again? Vivy-large has suffered! What happened? Accommodation list is out. Not true. Did you check for me? Me and Chizzy my sister, corner B. And me? Corner D. What is this? Even in Final year? Why didn't I get A corner? Who got the A corner? Apparently, the people who don't speak. It's a lie. They gave freshman the A corner? Leave this issue for a player. Anyway, where is Chizzy my sister? Chizzy has refuse to come back. No need for rush, she's now my cousin. Obi-one! My link to happiness in the UK. Oxford graduate. You can't make these things up. But Vivy, I still can't believe it. So, Ace and Chizzy have really broken up? They were so perfect together. Helen, let me tell you something. When a man likes you, And you like him. Enjoy it! Enjoy it very well so when it crashes, If he leaves you, leave him! You know. Forget all the stuff you read in romantic novels. Forever after... Happy ever after, is a lie! You understand? Still hating on your choir master? Get out! You're an idiot. It's okay. You will see. You'll see, you will come to me for advise.

I can't explain it. I thought that I was... It's Ace, right? I knew it. I knew she wasn't over Ace, I told you. I knew it. You told who? Shut up! Listen, i've told you, Where is Ace? Don't talk to lairs. Vivian, find something to do. I told you. Things like this are not easy to deal with. I knew she wasn't in love with Obi and I told you. I told you as much. -I told you. - Helen, If you touch me again, I'll slap you! You are begining to challenge me too much. Find something to do. I know why you're angry, and you have every right to be. But, When Obi propose to me, i just realized i wasn't over Ace. Hmm, Your cousin is a nice man, but, But what? But what? - Ehn. - Vivian? Stop. Where is Ace? Ace. Ace.. Ace. Ace.. Just because a man did something bad to you means all men are the same? Helen. Helen, don't spoil the love I have for you. The love i have for Ace is stronger than that for Obi. Hmm.. Ace, Makes me feel content. And with Obi, there is a void. I can't explain it. That's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's not a problem. No, I said no problem, no problem. It's okay. It's okay. But let me ask you Chizzy my sister, Where is Ace now? Has he fought for you? Do you see him running after you? Saying Chizzy, Chizzy, Chizzy? I was hoping that maybe he will come and confess his flaws, and... And love me the same way he used to. That's what I am telling you people, happily ever after... Emm, Chizzy, I kind of have to go, but I may not be back in time. Okay. I'll see you later okay. Just take it easy Helen, where are you going? What's your business? Is the rice i gave you... What's your business? It's the rice... What's your business? Chizzy my sister, See ehn, Vivy-large can never deceive you. It's not in my nature. You know how I feel about you. If I do not love you, I won't tell you any of these. Don't trust a man who is not there for you. Not chasing you, Not looking for you, Betraying you, Causing your heart to beat. Why? Ehn, you see a man that likes you, Love you, pursue you, Don't cry, don't cry, Chizzy. Don't cry, It's a good thing, when you enter our family, See me now, you know Vivy-Large. You know how we do. Hey, my link to happiness in the UK, Remember, he is an Oxford graduate. Made man, Forget this NYSC, it's for business to run. Okay? Maybe, You are right. I.. I should probably just get on with my life. Yes. Now, you are talking, you are listening and reasoning reasonably. Beautiful woman like you. So, Should I call you aunty Vivian. Chizzy, stop it! Who's aunty Vivian? Am I not a young girl like you? All you should call me just like before , is Vivy-large. Or, Vivian. Hey, is that the ring? Wonderful! Come... Come now, welcome to the family. Welcome to the family, my sister. Oh, should I come with you? Wow, okay. Wedding is happening. My friend, look away. Who called you? You don't speak. You don't speak. But I'll soon deal with you. I do not believe this. -Keep your voice down. -I would not keep my voice down I mean, how can you be fucking me and marrying her? Does that make any sense to you? As per sleeping with me, you offerred! Why?... She doesn't love you. I love you! How could you be playing with my emotions like this? Chizzy is still in love with Ace. Why would you want to marry someone who is in love with someone else? -Helen? -Lies! What's going on here? Would you shut up and give me that your ring now. Are you two sleeping together? No, No... Shut up there. Shut up. Give me back my ring. What? You told them that you love Ace. What? And you've been telling me you love me. Give me my ring. I know this looks really stupid, but, You love me right? What is love about without forgiveness and acceptance? Please, You want to marry me? Yes. Yes. You want to marry me? Yea! Yes! I'll marry you, yes. You're still there? You're still... Get out! Get out! Out! Viviy... Viviy-large You'll eat, yam and... Aa.. Chizyy, my sister What happened? Chizzy? Why are you behaving as if you're possessed. Is Everything okay? Vivian, did you know? Know what? I swear to you, Vivian, I'll kill you today if you don't tell me the truth! Truth about what? Vivian, I'm not joking with you. Who is joking? I'm not joking with you, why should I? - Vivian - Yes? I said I'll kill you today... Please, come to my aid! Tell me the truth! Wait! Wait, stay between us. Ella, move! Ella, stay! Chizzy, I'll confess, okay? Start talking. No need to... the letter is here. What letter? The letter Ace left. What? Ace, left a letter. When? -Last week... -Last week!? I'm dead! Where is it!? No, wait. Wait, I'll bring it. Ella, hold her. Move! Take it. Take it. Ace left her letter last week! You were at Obi's house. He got the internship to SA! What is love? Those are the words that will haunt me for weeks! I thought I knew, I thought I loved you... But when the question was asked, I knew, I didn't. I didn’t even know what love is. But I wanted to love you. You, were my desire. So, I went in search of love. I went in search of God. And found out that love wasn’t words. It was intention either. The scary part of my discovery was that love wasn’t even my belief. I believed for 6 years, that I loved you and that I was going to marry you. but that wasn’t love too. Me sacrificing my entire allowance to buy you an engagement ring, Wasn’t love either. What then is love? Love, Is patience. And I had to learn patience. for months, I watched my future wife dine with another. But then, Love endures long Love never is envious, Nor boils over with jealousy. Love is not boastful Or vain glorious, Does not display itself haughtily. It is not rude. And does not act unbecomingly. Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, Love is ever ready to believe the best of every person, Its hopes, are fadeless under all circumstances, a and it endures everything. Love, never fails. Before now, I wasn’t deserving of you Chizzy. No man is deserving of any woman until he knows what love is. Know that I know, Will you please let me love you? Let me make your dreams mine. I’ll be waiting for you. I leave on the 21st, of April. Look inside your passport. Forever yours, Akinola Cole Eniola. Helen, Come. Just come. Chizzy, my sister, is it me, Vivy-large That you Challenged? You threatened to stab me? Me? A, Where is that knife? Where is the... Helen don't hold me. Don't hold me. By the time I'm done with you in this campus, Have you not heard of my name? Why Vivian? Why? Why did you do it? Do what? Do what? Chizzy my sister, what did I do? That you were here crying everyday, crying, My cousin said he likes you, I brought you both together. Now, he loves you, And, how you repay me is by threatening to stab me? Knowing that he was sleeping with Helen. You knew! - And Vivian you did this to me! - Know what? Wait? Aaa! Helen? Why didn't you threaten to stab her? I didn't know. You made me miss out of the love of my life, Because, you're just selfish! The both of you, you're just, Chizzy, my sister, Obi is wrong for this thing that you said. But, I still cannot take it! I wish the both of you the best. Is that how you are leaving it? I won't accept! No, we cannot leave this matter like this,. Not on this campus. Ella, if you address me again, I'll slap you. What is it? Didn't you hear she tried to stab me? Meanwhile, you Helen, "He tried to, and you don't want." "He's not trustworthy." Now he is trustworthy. A, Helen, is that a ring? Shame on you! Because you want to be engaged, You're finish! My head, Hey you, Hey, Take it easy, your body has been through a lot. What happened? You were attacked and... Attacked? And what? Chizzy, sometimes, We ask the wrong questions. Rather than celebrating our victories. Ella? You should be thankful. Thankful for what? Ella, stopped the rape Rape? How? According to her, she followed you after you fight with Vivian. She said she was worried you might hurt yourself. She said she ran as fast as she could to get help. Why... Why me? Chizzy, you should be thankful. Thankful for what? I've lost everything Everything, I've ever wanted. Ace, and... and then, Vivian... These are just bruises. You'll heal. What of the bruises in my heart? What about Ace? Every... Well, You can still get him if you catch the flight to Lagos today. What are... What do you mean? Hi Chizzy, Good to see you Pastor Sam, No, call me, Dr. Sam. Em, What do you mean by if I make it to Lagos today? Wait, just wait for me to finish with her. Of course dear.

What do you mean by if I make it to Lagos? Let me just get discharge papers. Thank you. Em, Well, I told Ace what happended. But his flight is today. How does that help me? What do you mean by "how does that help you"? I pushed him away. I, I ruined everything. And, I accused him of so many things. Well, technically, Your, accusations might have an element of truth. Really? So, there was something... No, Something betweeen the two of you? No, not really. I liked Ace. If you hadn't walk in on us that day, Who knows, I might have kissed him. What would've happened after that? I don't get what you are saying. My point is, Chizzy, I liked Ace. But he chose you. He loves you. I feel so ashamed of myself. Well, he's not ashamed of you. And if... even if you loses Ace's love, There's a greater love out there. His love. I know this because, I'm not perfect. (speaking french) (speaking french) (speaking french) (speaking french) (speaking french) (speaking french) No matter how far our bad decision can take us, It's never too far our right decision to save us.
