What is going on here? Some musician. I didn't know that you sang. What are talking about? I've never heard you sing. You've got a good voice. I was in an a capella group in college. You were in an a capella group in college? Onomatopoeia. Why didn't I know this? You never asked. Well, you never sing. Let's see. Goh. Goh Nakamoo-ra? It's Nakamura. So, I'm making chia seed pudding for breakfast tomorrow morning if you want any. Mm-hmm. Did you eat? Yeah, they ordered pizza. By the way, I'm gonna be a little bit late tomorrow night. - He's pretty good. - Yeah. Go Goh! Yeah, he seems talented. How'd you find this guy? Um, I just stumbled on him. Wait right there for me. Let's take off mommy's shirt and put this on. Don't you want to wear your own clothes? Starting route to Jacob Funeral Home. Here. Take it. Hey, it's Goh. Leave me a message. Goh, you're late! Where are you? Okay. So, this is the urn that I was telling you about earlier. Okay. It comes in several different finishes and sizes. We don't allow food in here. Oh, sorry. I didn't know. Thank you. Come on, come here. Yeah, I don't know. Do I have to decide now? Uh, no, but... where's your daughter? Oh no. Sachiko? Sachiko? I already made the arrangements. The service is on Sunday. I'm so sorry. She threw up. That's why she's wearing my shirt. Did you sleep on your flight? I did. Um, then I fell immediately asleep at the hotel, around like 8 last night? Well, that's very nice. It's back. Huh? Oh, you know that I was gonna take care of the music for the service, right? I thought you meant that you would just make a playlist. Yea-Ming's been holding onto the guitar since we moved. I didn't see her. She was out for a job interview or something, but I saw her roommate, Jasmine. Actually, she's playing a last-minute show tonight? You know, I thought maybe I could take Sachiko? You don't wanna come, do you? I'm exhausted. I haven't slept in days, and I've been by myself with Sachiko all morning. I'm sorry. What are you up to now? Are you gonna see your cousin Janet? Julia. Look, I'm... I'm trying really hard to be supportive here. I thought you'd be happy to have more time to yourself or with your family and... What in the world makes you think any of this makes me happy, Goh? I'll get you the car seat. Ready to go to your first show? Okay. ♪ Running down The empty streets ♪ ♪ Headphones on my lonely feet ♪ ♪ 31 years, just to know ♪ ♪ Raison d'être ♪ Sweetie, Alfie's toys are everywhere. Okay. Thank you so much. Mm-hm. We met at Eboni's baby shower, right? Um, maybe. I think it was at Kiara's fifth birthday, right? Kiara's fifth birthday? Yeah. When did Kiara have a birthday? Uh, I think it was... - September 11th. - Oh, September 11th, poor kid. Eboni's parents threw her a huge picnic down in Compton. - Crenshaw. - Crenshaw. Oh. I wasn't invited. Oh, well it was mostly family and just friends from school, so. How do you know Eboni again? We were in a band together in college. Oh, that's right. What? Eboni was in a band? What did she play? Wasn't it guitar? No, bass. She also sang. Well, she absolutely loves you. I mean, you come highly recommended. I'm sorry you couldn't meet Alfie in person. He's staying at his nana and pop-pop's tonight. But I'm sure you know the drill. You probably babysit all the time. Yeah, I do. I mean, not professionally, but... Oh, but Eboni says that you're amazing with Kiara. I love that kid. There you go. You got kids of your own? No. I don't. But you want them. I mean, I don't even have a boyfriend right now, so. You guys got any single friends? You take PayPal, right? Uh, Venmo, or cash? Honey, we have Venmo, right? I think. Do you have a credit card with us? What? Uh, no. Do you want to apply for one?

I'm so sorry. Is it okay if I just wear this dress for his funeral and return it? It's okay if I just keep the tags on? Our return policy is for unworn clothing only. Sorry, sorry. Yeah. That's, uh, $297? Hi, Dr. Levin. It's Rachel. I need to schedule an emergency session by myself. I'm still regressing, I'm still being self-destructive. I've been thinking about this guy, this... He was my best friend from high school. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just trying to get even with Josh for what he did. If you have time, just let me know?

So, I guess Josh is still getting blow jobs from his assistant? You allowed to smoke on this diet? So, have you checked his text messages lately? No. My shrink told me I shouldn't be doing that anymore. She's like 22. He's not gonna leave me for her. Sorry I've been so M. I. A. Freakin' YouTube channel's taken over my life. You're so lucky your husband's rich. Ah, maybe with all your free time you can rebrand my site? Should I text Goh, see if he still has a crush on you? I don't care. - Yeah right! - I don't care. Hey, dude, period. I'm drinking kale juice with your prom date right now, period. Amy, don't send that! What is wrong with you? Oh! Let's send him a selfie. And let's use a fun filter. Why are you acting like a teenage girl? I'm not ready to just casually reconnect with him after all these years. He's probably just living in Wisconsin, in Green Bay with... Madison, Madison. Eating cheese or whatever they do there. Actually, they broke up. He's still living in their house, but they're not together anymore. When did this happen? Couple months ago, when I was in Boulder shooting those energy drink videos. I forgot to tell you. Yeah, you did. Last time I saw Goh, he was a zombie. And he's still not playing music. So lame. Oh shit! What? - Who just texted you? Give me... - No. - Amy, give me your phone. - No. All right, this is the top one, and this is the bottom one, and you turn to the left. Wait, is that right? Hold on. Let me check. Yeah. You turn it to the left, away from the door. Okay? Okay. I took in the mail and the newspapers, and they're all on the dining room table. And I tried to air out the place a bit. Actually, it smells a lot better than it did before. Oh! Erika, I'm so sorry. I didn't wash the sheets. Is that okay? Should I strip the bed? Oh, no, it's fine, thank you. Oh, and the funeral home said they didn't find a wedding band on him. Do you know where he might have kept it? No. Huh, he wasn't wearing one. Um, okay. Did you get my email about the visiting professor job? Yes. Oh, good, because the department head said they're really desperate to fill it. Hey, why don't you come to campus with me, and I'll show you around, introduce you to people? Oh, I don't know if can... Erika. You're applying. There's no way you're not. Okay? It's only for two years. It's just our house is there and everything's there. All right, then sell it, sublet it, whatever. You own this place now. What about Goh? You really think he wants to go back to Wisconsin? Erika, I'm sorry, I have to go. You want to do dinner? Does Sachiko even do sushi? I think she's gonna be with Goh, still. Okay, you have to eat. I think I'm just gonna take it easy tonight and stay in, eat some of dad's ramen. Oh god, that's depressing. I am depressed. Erika. You need to change. You need to be here. I need you here. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? But I'd better see your application, all right?

I guess it's been five years, then, since I've seen you. Did you get your guitar back from Jasmine? I did, yeah. Cool. She's a good one. I played her all the time. She? Her? What? Yeah. I named her Goh-hana. Goh-hana! Stupid! She actually misses you all the time. Hey. Can we get one of those shirts? Do you want an extra small? Something for a small child. All right, let me grab that for ya. Let's see. What do you say, Sachiko? You like that? You want it? Let me fold this up for you. What do I owe you? It's totally fine. Here. - No, seriously, I... - She's gonna be so cute in it! - Seriously. - No. Please don't. - I gotta support your art and... - No, you don't. Nope. Please. That's so dorky. Just take it. Sachiko. Hey. Come on. I gotta take her to her mom. - Oh, how is "The Professor?" - She's good. Yeah? I heard about her dad. I'm so sorry. Are you staying with her? Uh, no. Erika and Sachiko are actually at her father's place. Where are you staying? Usual spot. That motel? Ew, really? Gross. You should stay with me, dude. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, Jasmine's never around anyway. She's always at some guy's house or some girl's house. She's got one of those bed in a box mattresses. You know what I'm talking about? I'm always hearing about those at the beginning of podcast ads. Yeah. Totally. They're actually really comfy. I paid for the room already tonight, but maybe they'll let me cancel the rest of the week. When are you going back to Wisconsin? I'm not sure yet. Yeah, Erika still has to sell her father's house, so... Okay. I figured I'd stick around a little bit to help out with this little one here. Yeah. - You want to try this on, Sachiko? Isn't that pretty? - Where? Let's go to the bathroom. I think we have to go to the bathroom. - Mm-hm. - Okay, let's go. Do you need me to take her? Nah, nah, I got this. Okay. Well, give me a hug. It's good to see you. - Okay. - Thank you. - All right. Bye-bye. Say bye. - Bye, Sachiko. Bye, Goh. Hey, Alexa? Play Goh Nakamura, "If You Want Me To." Hey Goh, period. Heard you're coming back to LA, period. If you have time, comma, I'd love to see you, period. Testing out Jasmine's bed for you, exclamation point. I am so sorry that I missed your show. It's fine. No worries. No, it's... I'm a terrible friend. But I have, you know, Harper. He's like, insisted that daddy read, so it was like the next thing I know, it's 9:45, and I got another... I really am sorry. It's fine. Whoa. Someone's trying to get in. Oh, shit, it's Goh! The guitar guy? Yeah. No, you want to go that way. No, the other that way. You know what, I'm gonna go let him in. Your hair's a mess. I don't care. Fuck. You look hung over. Shut up! Hey, man. Alex. Goh, come on in. Wow. You weren't exaggerating. This place is like really nice. What are you doing here? I got your new song. You're finally writing again? I'm, you know, here to help. Um, okay. Um, I'm kind of working right now. No, no, it's fine. I got this. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Go take a break. All right, thanks. You still teach? Um, not really. The kids these days, they kind of like playing music and making music on their computers more than anything, so. Do you miss teaching? Yeah, I do, I do. Yeah. Did you ever think you'd be a full-time dad? I still have a job. Oh. What do you do? Customer service. I always thought I'd have a family, but I also thought that I would still be able to play music, you know? Like you. Oh my God. Do not compare your life with mine. Why not? Cause you're like a fucking adult. You're an adult. I mean, I've got this stupid roommate, and she's young, and she makes more money than me, and she goes to school. I don't know. You're doing what you love though. Can I tell you a secret? Secret? Yeah. In Madison, I bought a cheap guitar. Just keep it in the storeroom. And I play it on breaks, you know. It's the only time I play, you know. I've become that guy. This is a secret? Like you never even told Erika? Oh, no, hell no. Fuck. Well, don't be that guy. Here. Help. So, since I texted you, I wrote a couple verses. Um, so, play G. A. C. D. And then it's sort of like... Yeah. Cool. Don't make it jazzy. I don't want it to be jazzy. No seventh chords and all that. All that jazz. Let's just do regular chords. Okay, yeah. Let's make it like move a little. Yeah.

No, seriously, fatherhood, it suits you. How about you? You ever think about becoming a mom, or... Cheers. What are we toasting to? Oh. Um, our high school reunion. Oh yeah. Go Cougars! Go Cougars. Should we sit down? Mm-hm. Sorry, I'm... I'm still packing up here. Trying to check out, crash with a friend. You know, there's such a thing as a maid service, Goh. Then you have to tip them every single day. Oh, but you should still be tipping them every single day. My life did not turn out as fancy as yours, so. What? - Amy gives me updates. - Oh. Seems like you guys are pretty successful. You and your husband. Josh? Mm-hm. You guys are happy though? Mm-hm, we're solid. Hey, I'm sorry it didn't work out with "The Professor." No, you're not. You hate her. I don't hate her. You hate her. She hates me. I'm sorry I let things get so weird. It's okay. 3I asked her to marry me. She obviously did not want that. I don't know what else I can do, you know? I pretty much gave up music for her. Erika said that? Not in those words exactly. What words? Did she say that, "Goh Nakamura, you're never allowed to play music again?" She didn't have to say anything. I mean, who wants the father of their child to be a struggling musician? Yeah, but to get rid of your guitar, that's really extreme, Goh. It's a distraction. It's a big life change. You're telling me that your kid has never heard you play guitar or sing before? She's heard the CDs and stuff, but it's not like I've ever serenaded her or anything. Tell you what, I'll let you practice on me. One song. No. Yeah. "Surrogate Valentine." No. Duet version. No. I really don't want to. Okay. Josh is cheating on me. Did you hear what I said? Yeah. No, I... didn't you just say you guys were solid? We are. We're in therapy. We're working shit out.

Nope, I keep getting myself. Hey, do you remember that weekend before I left for college, when I slept over? Mm-hm. Yeah. You were drunk. I was pretending to be passed out in your bed. Around curfew, I just... I pretended and then, um, I was just lying in your bed, waiting for you to make a move. And I wasn't about to take advantage of a drunk girl. Well, but I wasn't drunk. I didn't know that. You're back early. Everything all right? Okay. Hi. Are you drunk? Two drinks! I had two drinks. Two dr... And you drove? Okay. Honey, I really need you to shut up, okay? I don't know what movie you saw, but I like how crazy it is making you. I'm not crazy. I didn't say you were crazy. I'm not crazy. Okay. Say it! You're not crazy. I'm not crazy. She stopped liking my photos. What? She stopped liking my photos. You're being a stalker. Actually, I think you're the one with the stalker. What? Goh's outside. What? Oh my God! How long have you been out there? Long enough to hear you don't have a chorus. You know, like we're dating, we're vibing, it's all going well. I feel like she's super into me, and finally I'm just like so stoked that I can stop dating dumb dudes, you know? Like who want to stick their tongue down your throat and don't know how to touch you? And then she just goes M. I. A. I don't get it. Ah, come on. Don't stop. Did you just write that? Mm-hm. You miss your calluses, huh? Yeah. They're buttery soft now. It kind of reminds me of something. Like a children's song? Fuck you. Fuck you. Sadly, I can't right now, but thanks for the invitation. I'm just gonna go study. You two behave. Okay. Oh! Yeah, hah! Trying to let you go. I'm gonna, frankly, destroy your song right now, but we'll put it back together. That's why... we're... Yeah. You gotta break the egg before you make the omelet.

I accept that you're an important part of his life. Thank you for saying that. I might move back here, and I don't know if Goh and I will ever get back together. But... I know how he feels about you. He loves you. He's always loved you. Wait, he told you that? No. But it's obvious. What's that like? To know, whatever happens, how much time passes, you guys are always connected?

Wait, how do you... Los Feleez, Filis? I'm gonna come pick you up, okay? Uh, I have Sachiko with me right now, though. Oh. I'm actually at Yea-Ming's apartment. Oh. Can you come here? Hello? Hello? Hey. Hey. Do you want a drink? What do you have? I've got beer and water. I'll have water. Do you want a, do you want a bite of mine? Hey, Sachiko, this is my oldest friend, Rachel. How old are you? - Oh. We don't ask grown-ups that. - Yeah. Are you hungry? You want to sit down? Actually, can we go somewhere and talk? Hey, Yea-Ming, do you mind hanging out with Sachiko for a little bit while I talk with Rachel outside? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure. Thank you. That should keep her busy. Thanks. Hey, are you okay? I'm just gonna do something, and I just want you to go with it, okay? What? Wait, hold on. What's going on? What's going on? Stop laughing, Goh. What? - This is bonkers. - This is bonkers? Shut up! - I didn't say anything! - Stop laughing! Stop it. Oh my God! All right. Try it again? I'm sorry, I wasn't ready. Try it again, try it again. Me try it again? You frickin' try it again. You try it. Rachel. What are we doing? I'm sorry, Goh. I love you. Fuck. Tell Yea-Ming I'm sorry? Don't worry about it. I'm so embarrassed. Don't be, don't be. I love you. - Bye. - Bye. What was that? I have no idea. What happened? Nothing really happened. What did she want? She didn't want anything. Oh, really? What are you not telling me, Goh? Do you want to be with her? Can we not talk about this in front of Sachiko? What are we doing? What are we doing here? Sachiko's not my kid, I'm not your babysitter. Yeah, I know. I know. - I'm not her mother. She's not like Goh-hana. - I know. - What? - Goh-hana, your fucking guitar! I know what you're talking about. I know who you're referring to... She's not just someone you can fucking drop off at my house anytime you can't figure out your life. You have no idea. I've got a life I've gotta figure out too! I can't be this girl. I can't be this girl. - What are you talking about? - I can't be this fucking girl. This "I-don't-give-a-fuck- who-you're-fucking" girl. I'm not fucking anyone. You were just fucking making out with Rachel on my sidewalk. You were just... oh my God! - I was what? - Fuck. Oh, thank you. Come here. Your nose, blow... I am too old for this. Hey. It's Josh. Listen, I'm not mad at you. I just... I need to cool off and think. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. When I get back, we can talk about everything. I love you. All right, bye. Is that my shirt? No, it was my dad's. Looks really good on you. I gotta tell you something. You can't get upset with me, because ultimately it doesn't mean anything. Rachel and I kissed earlier today. It was terrible, awful. No, it's funny because I used to daydream about it when I was a kid, you know, and the reality of it was just, nah. Nah? Nah. You know, I've been thinking about how things used to be. I'm sorry if I made you feel like you couldn't have a life outside of us. We used to be... I just want us to, I don't know... Stop making it so hard. Yeah. I don't know. I was thinking that moving to LA isn't such a bad idea. I could probably get a transfer to the LA office, maybe get an apartment close to you and Sachiko? Or... You could just save the money and live here with us. Good night. We ready? We're rolling. "I Will Make You Mine," vocal and guitar.
