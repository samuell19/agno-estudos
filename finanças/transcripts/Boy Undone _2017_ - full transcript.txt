Subtitle: Manvagtoo Hi. Do you feel better? We're going to be okay. What's your name? What's wrong with you? Why don't you want to talk to me? You live near? What's wrong? Tell me. What is wrong with you? Give me your cellphone. Give it to me! I don't have one. Don't you move. Don't move! Don't you have a wallet? Where is your ID? I can't believe you don't have your school credential. You've got to have something! You forgot about last night? What is your name? I don't know. Why are you living alone? Two years ago I left home. Were you living alone? I broke up with my boyfriend four months ago. Do you study? Hey! Come on! My father owns coffee shops. We are from Vera Cruz. And I am in charge of the administration. Where is it? The last week we had problems with the electricity. Here we want a 'Welcome' sign. But I still don't know. For example. These balloons look bad. My cousin helps me with these flowers. But they don't look good. What's up, Carlie? Jezus came? Yeah... He came. Okay. And the bills I asked you about? They are ready. But faster. They are waiting for you. Yeah. I'm ready. See you later. I will be here upstairs. Okay. Come with me. Would you give me a job? Come on. This is the cellar? No. It is my secret place. Believe it or not.... These little mattresses are comfortable. I'm joking. You are very squeamish. Now I know how you are. You are very squeamish. Come on! Let's try. No! They are comfortable, aren't they? Do you have any plans? For what? For your life! At least for tomorrow. Have you decided? What? Are you going to work in my coffeeshop? I only came for my laptop. You know what? Tomorrow we are going to take a little walk. Good night. This is the zone. Really, you don't remember anything? I don't know who I am. I can't remember my name. Don't know how I ended up with you. How did you get to the club? You are not gay. Yes I am. Please. I can notice. You are very tight. You never have been fucked before. I must leave you here. But... You know where I live, right? If you need something, reach out. Don't leave me here, please. Find me at this address. Get dressed. It is time to go.. Where? Do I need to dress you, or what? Calm down. Calm down. Whose room is this? Don't remember. Don't get mad. It is a joke. Don't touch. Who slept here? My brother. He lived here only for two months. Did you kick him out? He did. With his girlfriend. He has not such a good taste like me. He went nuts with my orgies. I am just joking. He is away with his girl. Fun as a clown. I'll go out. Wait for me. Wait for me here. I won't be late. Watch out for the dog. He can't go out. His name is Doggy. I found it on my wy home. Are you thinking you use the same clothes all the time, or what? Won't lend you my clothes. I am very special with that. I asked you for a job. I don't wanne be a parasite. You'll start this Monday. You go as helper. I hope you don't break anything. You have to start from the bottom. That couch is on the wrong side. If you are going to stay, at least bark at me. Come to bed! It is cheaper you sleep with me, because later I'll have to buy you a house like Doggy's. In that drawer, I have an old cellphone. Turn the lights off. Why did not you leave me there? Why did you take me with you? I could not leave you there. Yes.... you could. Wy don't you want to know what happened before? At least you know what it is you're hiding from. You are hiding. One thing is, I don't know who I am. And other is, I know what is what I want. Are you okay? What were you dreaming? Who are you thinking? Nothing. Did you not hear me? I say: 'Who are you thinking'. Not: 'What are you thinking'. How was it? That night at the club. You were in the bathroom. You were unconscious. Then some guys walked in, and start to.... How did you bring me here? I carried you in my arms. You could walk. But it was difficult to climb four floors. You woke up. We had sex. And then you slept again. You were feverish, and then I took you to my brother's bedroom. So you would sleep well. You did not look well. Then I took a bath. When I was out of the shower, you were there. You were dressing. Yes. I remember you since that moment. You! Have you ever... wondered if what you remember was a dream or something that really happened? I am living a dream. He... is there. All the time. I don't know who he is. I can't remember his voice. No, no, no, no. no! Leave me alone! Please... Don't! Leave me alone! Who are you thinking? Where are you going? Stop running away. Fuck. Understand that I can't remember anything! But you remember him, isn't it? And you? Me what? You see other guys, don't you? You fuck other people. Don't you have a boyfriend? I would live with him. But you are fucking other guys. Do you think I don't notice it? Are you jealous? You are jealous in here. I can't remember anyone. You are the one who hide, seeing other guys. I am with no one. You are. Fernando? Do you know him? He called you Fernando. He called someone else. Let's go and ask him. No, no. Who was that kid? I should have follow him. He could answer me, instead of you. How do I know you are not hiding? I only want to find a lead. Don't you want to know? I am going to fix it. Don't worry. Mike! You arrived early. What's up Are you looking for Tony? He is going to be late, that fuckin' lazy. Today, I want to see you. What's up, Br? Hey man. Come on! It's a personal favour. You can help me, Paquito. What's up? Security video's. I need to know what happened on Friday, two weeks ago. What you are asking is huge, Mike. I know, Paquito. Well, let's do it. You owe me a beer. 'The Pink Zone' was something different. Not only it was the chic zone... It was something else. It was the cultural center of Mexico. The artistic corridor. The artistic heart of the whole country. When I allowed Cuevas to paint his famous mural.... Everyone... Listen well... Everyone wanted to kill me! And in the newspaper, you read that Everyone was telling me that I would have a career. That I was going to triump. But I did not want to. The fellows of the politic party defends what they have fiercely. Before they trashed me, I said to them: 'Go fuck yourself.' And look at me now. I am happy. I really love your grandpa. He was the only one who helped me without any convenience. He only needed one call from me to get the coffee concessions. And then your father turned them into coffee shops. That was a long time ago, son. More than thirty-six years. I don't know anyone anymore. But your son does. You did a good job. Well... You watch him on the tv all the time. Ricardo is a useless bump politician. Deputy... Can you believe it? He thinks, he is winning. The poor little fucker. It is useless. It is his mother's fault. She allowed many things. I never loved her. She was just the charade. You have to remember, those were tough times. Very hard times. You are a guy from the wave, isn't it? I would prefer to live in this epoque. Now there is all freedom. Everyone can do whatever he wants. In the past, we had to be married. Fucking piece of shit society! Retrogade people! There they are! In a big mansion... Just after the opera! Having dinner in abundance! And for what? To end up devouring each other. Being trapped, and with no exit. Taunting themselves.... Claiming horrible stuff about our lives. Decrepit bourgeois... A terror situation. Something truly dreadful. Something that cannot allow us to leave that place! The bourgeois.... Of course... We, the bourgeois.... end up like poor beggars! To end up devouring each other, with all.... using our tongues. Because that is our fate as human beings. Lawyer.... I got the security video's I've got pictures of the guy I'm searching for. I only want you to trace him. Please. Ricardo ows a lot of favours. And I owe a lot to your grandfather. But I don't owe you anything. You're only his grandson. If you ask me, my friend... It is easy to find the boy you've searching for. It was harder to find the deputy's father. And you did it. You all know him. I want to know something. Why are you doing this? Is it because you love someone? You are just like your grandfather. The great Don Panchito. Big balls man. A real bad ass! And loyal. Always loyal. It has to be the truth. So how are we gonna fix this? The good way, or the bad way? Fucking horny little fag. Do you want me to fuck you again? You better talk, Ricardo. They are watching you. I got the warning from the police. If you want, you can deal with it your self, idiot. At your coffee shop, you sell drugs. Did you see me selling drugs? Never. What? Never, asshole. Never. asshole. And did you see drugs were sold at my coffee shop? Brandon was selling it. Stop the bullshit! At the bathroom, pussy! I don't give a shit, faggot! Me what? Besides... What has it to do with what you are asking me to do? What? Do you want me to take him to your home to fuck you? That guy is in your school. I want you to take him to your appartment. Where you hold your parties. Get the fuck out of here, man! People from my school don't go to those faggot places. You know how easy it is to sing? Anonymous denouncements are on fire! Cool down, fucking whore! I only buy you the stuff. At my coffee shop, the drug was not sold. Brandon was the one who sold it. Cut the bullshit! That idiot left. It's your choice. Mike! Use your brain. Do you know how many people study at the Ibero? How am I going to find this dude? You have not even given me his schedule! I have spoken. The PGJ is searching for you. If you want my help, you'll have to cooporate. And the other cellphone? You are recording this, son of a bitch! You decide when we can do it. This idiot! Leave that, dude. So tell me. Have you sucked Nancy' tits? She gave me blue balls. That sucks, dude. But you sucked Patricia's tits! You suck them even for free. She is a bitch. A bitch! But speaking for real... That abuse of Fernando of you and that girl.... That dude was a closeted gay. And how is she? Patricia has tits, so white... I prefer Nancy's tits. I like them brown. Nancy's tits. And how good is she? She rocks! Hold on, dude. Fer, Fer, Fer! Please, Fer! Fer... Please tell him not to hurt me. Please tell him not to hurt me. Please tell him not to hurt me. Fer... Please! Fer! Lease tell him not to hurt me. Fer... Please! No, no, no! It was that whore Patricia! Don't you remember, Fer? It was Patricia's fault. That fucking bitch dragged me to this shit. Don't you remember what happened between you and her, Fer? It was because of that whore. Fucking bitch! That whore is going to pay! She only... She only asked me for help. That's why I gave you the pill. We took you to that faggot club. It was only a joke. She told me, she was tired of the problems with your dad. And you don't want to go with her. I only wanted to help her. She only wanted to set you a trap. It was not my idea. It was her fault. Fer! Why don't you remember nothing? Fer. You have to remember. It was not my fault. It was her idea. It was not my fault. She only wants your money. It was Patricia's fault. You have to remember, Fer. I remember you. No, no, no!!! Fer! Please! You... Vanish.... If you talk, I know where to find you. Subtitle: Manvagtoo
