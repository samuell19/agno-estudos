PLASTER Fitz, give me a hand. - I want mom. - Bente, it will be fine. OK ? Quickly, quickly. Oh, sweetheart... Thanks for the ride... - Sonja. - Right, Sonja. Thanks. Can you manage ? Got the bag ? Don't forget this. There. Good luck. OK ? - I know, but I just don't have it. - Dad... Wait a minute, sweetheart. Their mother has all the cards and they were at my place. We were going to buy a sled and the neighbor had... The insurance company ? Cross Care, I think. No, O&R Insurance. Is that possible ? - Date of birth ? - No, something with a "u". There's one with a "u". - Dad... Hold on, I have to talk to this lady. I want mom. Don't cry, OK ? OK, date of birth... February 3. It's mom's birthday on February 3. Bente's birthday is February 8. Born in 2009. And this is the tip of her finger. Show me again. I can tell it's going to be all right. It happens a lot. And the doctors here are great. Fingertip specialists. - Tell me who Mr. Moto is. - Mister Moto ? - He's our dog. - A dog. How nice. But he's living at Aunt Jet's now. - Were you allergic ? - No, our parents are divorced. There. This is for the pain. Good girl. How did you manage to get it all the way off ? I was riding at the back of dad's bike. But I was turned backwards or I couldn't hold the sled properly. Excuse me, sir, doctor, I just want to know... Are you going to put this back on, or will it die then ? Two things: fingertips don't die that quickly, especially not with children. High five. It will be sewn back on and you'll have a zombie fingertip. Cool, right ? Secondly, I'm not a doctor, I'm a nurse. And nurses are only allowed to clean severed fingertips. The doctor will put it back on. But it may take a while. It's kind of busy today. So this stays around your finger. You fill this out and I will take care of this. OK ? It'll be fine. I'll do this. Dad? Address ? Put down mom's address. Put that's the address from Thursday until Sunday. - And it's Monday. - Come on, Fitz... I can't even remember my zip code yet. - Felicia ? - Fitz. Honey, what are you wearing ? Where are dad and Bente ? - Do you actually have time for this ? - Not now, Felicia. Where are they ? - Suzanne ? - Mom. Oh, honey... Gosh, sweetheart. It'll be fine, sweetie. Typical. Suus, please. It was an accident. Who lets a child ride on a bike with a sled ? It was slippery. Didn't you notice ? The police gives out warnings, but there are different rules for you. - It's always the same thing with you. - Oh, come on. - You don't have to be so angry. - Why are you wearing that mask ? - Is that mask your idea ? - What ? No. No, I think the neighbor said... Felicia, don't be ridiculous. Take off that mask. Now. Put it back on. I'm going to get chocolate milk. It's going to snow. Those are snow clouds. I climbed onto the roof of our school once. I rolled a huge snowball and went through the roof. Twenty-two stitches. How about you ? What's the stupidest thing you ever did ? I don't know. I bet you're the most well-behaved girl I know. I bet I'm the stupidest girl you know. I wouldn't mind taking that bet. A croquette sandwich. If you're the stupidest, I'll give you a croquette sandwich. - A croquette sandwich ? - Yes. And if I win, you pay. OK. OK. MOM HAS TO DIE Mom has to die ? Why did you do that ? Why should I tell you ? I don't even know you. - Adam Cutter. - Pleased to meet you. With a last name like that, I'd become a surgeon. How funny would that be ? Being called Cutter. Then you should marry me. Simple. I'd jump into a volcano before I got married. - Everyone wants to get married. - And have kids and divorce. Give your kids a back-and-forth bag and dump them at their mom or dad's. - So you're not going to get married ? - No, I'm not. OK. And you're here to have that removed. No. My sister chopped off the tip of her finger. - They have to sew it back on. - That makes more sense. How about you ? Why are you here ? That thing with your sister will take a while, so we can go and have croquettes. And you pay, because you're not that stupid. Come on, I'll help you. I'll give you a temporary bandage and then we'll have to wait for a doctor. - But... - Sorry, but we have emergency cases. Are you OK ? No, she's not OK. My daughter... I don't understand why you went to this hospital. It's always busy here. You know that. Dad took great care of me, you know. Sorry, sweetheart. Sorry. Mom is just very worried. What's keeping Fitz ? I thought you were ill. When you're in a wheelchair, everyone leaves you alone. It's as if you're invisible. In contrast to someone with a tiger mask. Neonatology. What's that ? Where did you get that key card ? Come on. It's not good. She literally wrote "mom has to die" across her face with a waterproof marker and it won't come off. See what I mean ? She really needs help. All right then. Because you asked so nicely. Let's have a look at the damage. Right. It's best to remove that. This is a hand sanitizer to disinfect your hands. I can remove it with that. Did you have a fight with your mom ? I used to have them a lot when I was your age. But they passed eventually. Not in my case. - What's going on? Yasmine ? - She needed help and... Children aren't allowed here. - What are you doing here ? - Nothing. I thought so. Come on, get out. Go. There are enough people downstairs who want to help you. - They're not allowed to be here. - I know that. Right. I thought so. - Do you think she's in trouble ? - Yes, of course. What if she loses her job ? She'll be fired at Christmas. Is there something we can do for her ? Croquette first. - Croquette ? - It helps me think. - But we're going to help her, though. - Of course. Call me when you have the money. I'll wait by the kiosk over there. - OK, but... - Are you backing out ? No, I'll go and get the money. But only because you helped me. The bet is still undecided. I could still be the stupidest girl you ever met. Wait until you get to know me better. - Fitz. - That's my name. OK, Fitz. See you soon. "I need you. Come to the silent room." - How old are you ? - Nearly eleven. - Can you go home after Christmas ? - Probably not. - You just said so. - Dr. Wong said: Maybe. But when grown-ups say 'maybe', it usually means 'no'. - So ? - I need you. To celebrate a real Christmas. Not in a hospital room with my parents, but a real ChristmaS, with a real tree and real lights and people and food and drink and music. You don't have to if you don't want to. I'm just happy we're friends. It's not that. I just don't know when we're going back home. When my sister's fingertip is sewn on, we're going back to my dad's place. I have to go. When she'd paid, she touched the sleeve of the herring man with her head. He looked a bit surprised, but Minoes continued on her way to the baker. - Look. - Is it back on ? Almost. First it's taking a bath. Where were you ? And your forehead... Happy now ? Can I have money for lunch ? - We were going to have lunch together. - That's a lot more fun. You have to remember that we had fun but that people change and grow apart. And now I want to have lunch by myself. - Give Fitz your phone. - Why ? Can I talk to you ? I want to keep my phone here just in case. - And your battery doesn't last long. - What do you mean ? If my battery's dead, we can't reach Fitz with your phone. I just want to be able to phone. Anything can happen. From mom's drawer. From dad's pocket. He just dropped it. Maybe it helps when they're together. I don't believe in love anymore. I'll be back later, OK ? That just isn't true, Joost. You know that too. - It's always switched off. - That again ? You can reach me. OK ? - There you go. - Thank you. - With a circular saw ? - Yes. How else can they reach your heart ? They go right through your chest and fold it open. Intense. Then what ? Dr. Wong took out my old heart and connected my new one. Don't you believe me ? It didn't hurt. - They put me under. Understand ? - Good thing. Now I have to wait until Dr. Wong says everything's all right. Oh, croquettes. Are you coming to Christmas Eve tonight ? Then we can decorate everything and have good food. I'm leaving with my dad soon. You know, I'll probably be here. So if I can help cheer you up, or something... Why are you here anyway ? You're in a wheelchair, but you can walk and you have a card. Primula... What was the deal ? - Yeah, dad, I'm coming. Mission Christmas, top floor. Half an hour from... now. You took over 600 steps. That's half the hospital. I don't want you spying on me. It's important to measure your exertion. - To measure is... - I know. I was just having a croquette sandwich and eating is living. OK, I'm resting. Look. I'm not even blinking my eyes. - Are you sure he's going to fire her ? - Yes, he's capable of it. I'll wait here. - Are you afraid of De Gooijer ? - I'm not afraid of anything. Just make sure you aren't caught. Get down. Just keep it in mind, so we don't have to do it again. - Why are you grumbling all the time ? - I'm not. - You are. Like: Rules are rules. - OK. You don't need to be that stern. - Hey, what are you doing here ? - We were worried. You're not allowed to be here. How did you get in ? De Gooijer... is he angry ? - Adam says he's going to fire you. - Well, we'll see. You have to leave now, or he'll fire me for sure. Come on. Is Benjamin Cutter related to Adam Cutter ? I'm sure you know I can't give you any information about patients. Come on, get out of here. - How come you know Yasmine so well ? - Who says I know her well ? You said she's the nicest person on the ward. - Do you come here often ? - I go everywhere and I know everyone. So do you know someone called Benjamin ? There was someone on the ward called Cutter, just like you. - Benjamin Cutter. - So what? There are lots of Cutters. Shall we go to a spot where hardly any people are allowed to come ? In the basement, but it's kind of creepy. So tell me if you're scared. Weren't you going to help Primula with Christmas ? - So you are scared. - Show-off. - So you do dare ? - Of course. Come on. I've been here before. What's so creepy about it ? Don't you find this creepy ? Hey, what are you doing here ? I was just showing her. Aren't you Bente's sister ? - Your mom's looking for you. - Fine, let her look. Help me up. You had it coming. Ready for the scariest spot in the hospital ? NO ACCESS Behind this door... What ? ...are people who didn't make it. - You mean... - The morgue. I knew you were scared. I've seen dead things before. Today even. Bente's fingertip. So you dare to go in by yourself ? Welcome to the linen room. Your face. What ? Nothing. We forgot about Primula. Is that Benjamin Cutter related to you ? I mean, you're always here. Same last name and you know everyone. You can tell me, you know. I told you I don't want to talk about it. - Yes, but... - I mean it. If you mention it one more time, I don't want to see you anymore. Sorry. Never mind. Primula ? Primula ? She isn't here. OK, tough luck. Where were you guys ? - I've been waiting for a long time. - I'm here now. We'll make sure you'll have a good Christmas. Sorry. Look. - I'll buy it for you. - No way. - It's too expensive. - I have croquette money left over. OK, we'll go to that lady and explain the situation... And buy the tree off her. - Look, Bor. - Nice ! - Do you like it ? - Yes. Look at the ornaments, the decoration. Fitz. Finally. Why didn't you answer just now ? Where are you ? Where's Bente ? I hope she's with you. We're worried and Douwe can't find her either. - Fitz ? - Yes ? Please come back. - Fitz ? - I can't. - I broke my arm. - What ? Here you are. Did you miss me too ? I missed you. Because we belong together. Right ? Go to sleep now. Sleep, fingertip, sleep Outside there is a sheep A sheep with four little white feet Who drinks his milk so sweetly Sleep, fingertip, sleep Outside there is a sheep Get a good rest, because we have a tough job ahead of us. Hey, you're Fitz' sister. Your fingertip is gone. That's Dr. Wong. She's my doctor, but she doesn't let me do anything. Do you know where Fitz is ? No, there's no change. He still looks like ET. Yes, they can borrow him when they make a sequel. A traffic jam of 48 kilometers ? How long will it take ? Yeah, I know it's snowing. Me ? You're insane. I'm not even allowed to do that, only parents. Mom, I'm going to hang up. Yes. Can I borrow your key card ? - Why? Want to look at bodies again ? - No. My arm needs a cast. - Is it broken ? - No, but I told my mom it is. Show your bandage a bit. It's cool. - What are you going to do ? - Fitz told your mom her arm is broken. So Adam is going to put a cast on it. And I'm the diversion. Can you go back to mom and dad ? They must be worried. So am I, about your fingertip. Just let her come. OK then. Come on. Guys... - What are you doing ? - Getting stuff. - Want to put the cast on in here ? - Are you scared ? Sit down. There. There. And back. There. OK ? There. - You can see them. - You should have taken them away then. You kept winding. No way. I waited, but you didn't say anything. They'll never get along. There's a better chance of a bear laying an egg. That's how much they're fighting. That isn't fighting. That's how people act when they like each other. And we'll bring them together. Fine. Have fun. Have a nice day. You won't feel a thing. Wanna bet ? Even if we'd chop off your entire finger now, you won't feel anything. Nothing. Nada. Niente. Rien de rien. Really ? If you do, you can chop off four of my fingers. - Why four ? - I want to keep my thumb... So I can act in zombie movies. I'll be the positive zombie. It still fits exactly. Are you sure it will grow back on ? You're nine, so it usually grows back on. What if it doesn't ? Then we'll give the fingertip to the positive zombie so he has something to eat. There. It's back on. Did you feel anything ? No, right ? I don't know. He looks like an alien. Yes. I have to go. Bye. Here you are. We're leaving, honey. Bente's fingertip is back on. I'll drive you to dad's place. Say goodbye. - I have to go. - Fitz... Coming ? Why does everything always have to go the way you want ? Honey, it's Christmas Eve. Haven't we been here long enough ? I don't know if you realize, but I have a life too. Like you do. I still have to say goodbye to someone. You're not going to wander around the hospital again. We're going. Now. Come on, sweetheart. Hurry, guys. I want to be home before it starts to snow again. Are you OK, dad ? It hurts a little bit. It's probably okay, but it might be a good idea for a doctor to take a look at it. Dad. When did the pain start ? I fell with my bike this morning. Tight stomach. Blunt force trauma. Ultrasound as soon as possible. - The children can't come in. - Then I'll stay with the children. - Joost, I'm staying here. OK ? - No, mom. Look at the state he's in. You can't just leave him alone. We really need to do the ultrasound now. You guys stay here. Watch your sister. Girls, your dad just had an ultrasound. The doctor will take a look at it and then we'll know more. What's a blunt force trauma ? - The doctor said he has that. - Yes. It's an injury underneath the skin. Usually after a fall or a crash. You can't really see it, but something's wrong. He's in the OR. We have to wait until we can operate him. My dad. He thinks I'm asleep, but a teddy bear is lying there. - Come on, Prim. - What ? He wants me to rest, but I've been resting for my entire life. - Then tell him that. - Yeah, I can tell him that. But he thinks I'm asleep, so I can't just run down the hallway. - No ? - No, then he'll never listen again. Hello ? Hi, I'm here to clean. The corners and all that. My daughter's asleep, so I think it's best if you came back later. I don't think so. I mean, I have to complete everything. Didn't I see you downstairs at the restaurant ? With that girl. No. With a girl ? I've been cleaning all day. Excuse me. Excuse me. A room like this is awesome, compared to my life so far. Yeah, right. After I got that new heart valve I thought I'd never leave my hospital room again or ever go to school. - Do you feel like going ? - Yes. I just thought I'd forgotten how to make friends. Come on. You not making friends ? You're the best friend maker I know. - Really ? - Yes, I swear. And life is much nicer than just this closet. Know what we'll do ? We're not going back to your room. We're leaving. How about that ? Primula. I don't get it. I just don't get it. The doctor says you need to rest, but you're not resting. You run away. You're in a closet with a cleaner. He isn't a cleaner, dad. He's Adam. Hi. She has to rest. Primula needs to rest. I don't want to rest anymore. I just want to live. The doctor said I have to build up stamina. Primula, listen... I'm going to grade six and I have to go to gym there too. And I have to be able walk around and be normal. How can I be normal when you stop me ? - Be normal ? - Yes, be normal. Just trust me. Okay. Okay, fine, but be careful. Be careful. Dad. He's asleep. Hey, Fitzie. Here she is. - How's it going ? - I don't know. A bit dizzy. He has to stay for a while to see how it's going. What mom said... That's how I feel. That I have to stay for a while. - Such a relief, isn't it, guys ? - Mom... come on. Fitzie, she is your mom, you know. - She's your dear mom. - Whatever. H... Hand. - Hound. - Right. Know what ? I think it's better if we go home. - Really ? - Yes. For Christmas. Otherwise we're just hanging around here. We might as well be home. Dad has to rest anyway. - So it's kind of practical. - It is. Very practical. But we're not going to do it. Fitz... What else can we do ? - Stay here all evening ? - That was the deal. - Christmas at dad's. - Fitz... A deal is a deal. You always say that, so... - E, elephant. - Right. D, doctor. F... Food. I'm not doing this to spite you. Doesn't it make sense to leave ? Dad's sleeping We're not allowed in his room. - So we're going to hang around here ? - I'm going to celebrate Christmas. Don't you worry about that. With dad ? You just said he has to rest. You enjoy this, don't you ? Talking around in circles. Come on, we're leaving. It's actually convenient that dad's here. Because we agreed with a friend to celebrate Christmas here. Right ? Well, Primula is kind of nice. - Primula ? - Yep. So we're going to celebrate Christmas with her and dad and you can do what you want. Exactly like you agreed on in the divorce. And now I have to go for a pee. Bye. Hi, this is Adam. I'm not here. I'll call you back. Or not. - Hey. - Hi. - I'm looking for Adam. - Adam ? I haven't seen him recently. Oh, shit, De Gooijer. Stay here. I can't let you in. We don't need more problems, do we ? You understand that, don't you ? Do you like him ? - What? De Gooijer ? - Yes. No, of course not. I don't. OK, out you get. This will look great when we're outside. -Outside ? That's a stupid idea. - But it's romantic. Dangerous, you mean. Are you out of your mind ? - It's all right. - No, it isn't all right. You're crazy. - Then I'll do it by myself. - Go ahead. You're insane. Are you scared or something ? Very funny, Adam. - We can't go on like this, Felicia. - Let go of me. Why are you being so difficult ? - Why do you keep running away ? - Isn't that convenient for you ? You're the one who wants to be alone, with your own life. - So celebrate Christmas alone. - That's enough. Let go of me. Felicia... - I have to leave. - Where to ? Home with mom. She wants Bente and me to celebrate Christmas with her. You're leaving. - No. I have to, but I'm not going. I'm going to celebrate Christmas with dad. - And with Adam and me ? - Yes. Good. So we have plenty of time. I have a plan, but Adam is too scared. - Adam is too scared ? - Yes. Want to help me ? - What's the plan ? - First say yes. - OK, now what ? - It's on the second floor. I think we can just about reach it. - What can we reach ? - De Gooijer's office, of course. Here's the banner and with that thing over there we can go up and hang it in front of the window. What's on the banner ? Yasmine heart De Gooijer. If you hang this in front of his window, he knows that Yasmine's in love with him. And then he'll dare to say so too. And then: Love. - But it's too dangerous. - It's a very stable thing. - Window cleaners use it. - I mean for your heart. - My heart is fine. - Even your dad says so. My dad said I can be normal. I thought you dared to do things, but you're scared too. Just like Adam. Maybe even more. OK, here we go. We stop just below the window. Make sure no one sees you. OK ? Primula ? Primula ? - Are you OK ? - I'm fine. - Really ? - A bit hot. Your coat is boiling hot. Keep going. OK, we'll hang it up here. Primula ? Primula, what's wrong ? Primula, wake up. Primula. Primula ? Wake up. Primula... I'm here. Squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand. Harder. Harder. As hard as you can. Good. It'll be fine. We're going down, okay ? Primula. Primula, sweetheart. Dr. Wong saw you outside. You can't do that. It's dangerous. I'll take you to your room. Can you come with me ? - I'm sorry, but... - This is what we'll do. Primula has to rest before she goes home. So you go and tell her that you can't see each other anymore. - But... - Is that clear ? Leave her alone. Are you sure you don't know where Fitz is ? You think Mister Moto has a good Christmas ? Want some ice cream ? Hey... I said the ice cream word. I miss him so much. Why can't he come and live with us ? - We've talked about that. - I just don't understand. Here... Get the biggest ice cream you can find. You deserve it. Hey, Fitz. That was fun. Too bad it didn't work out. Here's your coat. Thanks for letting me use it. - I have a plan. - Dr. Wong said... - Dr. Wong says a lot of things. - Yeah, but she said... - I have to go home. - But you said you were staying. Yeah, but you know what parents are like. So we're not having a real Christmas ? Well, Bente's fingertip is back on and my dad is doing better. So... Anyway, that's it, I think. Get well soon. Bye. Are they soft ? Not that soft. Stupid things. That dog is cool. Do you like dogs ? - And Fitz ? - She does, but she likes monkeys more. - Will you get Fitz a cuddly toy ? - No, don't be stupid. You have to help me with something. With what ? Who does something like that ? A cast when you haven't even broken your arm. It's stupid. - You said that. - Well, it is stupid. I'm the stupidest girl in the world. - I was scared of Prim's plan too. - It was a stupid plan. You responded well. Yeah, but you gave her the day of her life. My dad's doing badly. My sister's doing badly. Primula's doing badly. - And what do I do ? - Don't forget about me. Putting on a cast to spite my mom. I don't think you're stupid at all, just angry. So put on your coat and we're off. OK, go ahead. Kick it. Harder. Again. No. Here. A monkey. - Do you like monkeys ? - They're my favorite animals. You can keep it. That Christmas tree or the other one ? Know what? I've got a better idea. Primula's getting the best Christmas ever. Yep. Look... Decorated. Decorated too. Boring. Very boring. This is so boring. Also very boring. - Careful or it will fall. - I got it. Hey, Prim. We were upstairs in the room of the bigwigs and... I thought you were gone. - What do you mean ? - I thought you were going home. Yeah, that... You can just be honest if you don't want to be friends anymore. What ? I knew you were a good liar, but I didn't know you were such a good liar. What's wrong ? Primula doesn't want to see me anymore. Dr. Wong told Fitz to leave you alone. She felt that was sad for you. That's why she said she had to leave. Understand ? She really wants to stay friends with you. And she still wants to make Yasmine and Dr. Gooijer to fall in love. - How ? - They want to tell you themselves. Coming? Or are you going to stay angry for the rest of your life ? The last time you asked for my help, it went kind of wrong. Remember ? One angry doctor in my life is enough, actually. That doesn't mean it will happen this time. It's for a girl who just underwent heart surgery. She's going to grade six after Christmas. - And will have the end musical. - She's nervous about the auditions. And because you're such a good singer, we thought... Well, now I can't say no. I have a break in 30 minutes. - We'll see you on the seventh floor. - But it's completely empty. It's empty. Very good. See you later. - Now we have to persuade De Gooijer. - Leave that up to me. What are you going to do ? I'll send it to Gooij. Wanna bet he'll come. Hello. OK, which one of you has to sing something ? - Me. - Do you know what you want to sing ? We printed off the lyrics. Thank you. That's such a coincidence. It's been playing in my head all day. One, two... Primula... Hello. Focus, OK ? - Shall we take it from the top ? - Yes. Are you sure Adam will make it work ? Doctors are always so busy. I'll go and have a look. Come on. Same tune. Didn't it work ? He'll be here in a minute. Hey. - Nice. - Thank you. Come quickly. They're kissing. What ? It worked. Hi. So how long will it take ? No, I already told you. I don't want to be skin-to-skin with him. No, mom, I don't want to hold him. Mom, I'm going to hang up. - Maybe you should... - Maybe you should stay out of it. All you do is look, but you don't buy anything. Okay... Everyone in the hospital knows you. They say 'hello' or 'hi'. Like Yasmine and De Gooijer. That's for a reason, because you're here so often. I think you're here because you care about him. Right ? And if you go to him now and let him lie against you you're not doing it for your parents, but for him. And for yourself. Take him very carefully. Very good. Hold him firmly at the bottom. Right. But he's feeling a little cold, so we... Keep seated and lean back. Yes, very good. This way he can breathe. Hold him against you. Usually, we only let the parents go skin-to-skin. But we're making an exception. His parents are gone for such a long time. Why's skin-to-skin good for babies ? People don't just need oxygen and food, but love as well. Doctors have to tell the truth, don't they ? And no nonsense about love. I can show you dozens of results of scientific research where this has been shown. It's not just good for the babies, but for the parents as well. Parents have to be able to hold their child. And a brother his baby brother. You're soaking wet. - Did you go outside ? - Where's Bente ? In the cafeteria downstairs. Do you know for how long your mom and Bente have been waiting for you ? It's okay. First put on some dry clothes. Let me help you. No. This is driving me nuts, Fitz. Yell at me or whatever, as long as this stops. I heard you in dad's new house. You told him you wanted a weekend without us. You'd go for a run, drink cocktails, sleep in, watch series. - Honey... - That's why I wrote that on my face. Know what I did this morning ? - Practice for the marathon ? - Yes. But first I looked at photos for two hours of you and Bente. Your birthdays, our holidays in Sweden. I was crying at the computer. And I shouldn't do that. I mean... I can't cry all day long on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. So then I went for a run. It was stupid of me to brag to dad about my busy schedule. But... I didn't want to show how awful it is for me to have so many days without you guys. You always say that in my presence. But in dad's presence you say that you can finally be yourself without us. It's not just about him, but also about us. It was about me. It sounded cruel, I understand that. Before I became a mom, I was someone already. And every evening and weekend I was able to do what I wanted. I was able to eat what I wanted, go to bed when I wanted. That was nice. But if a wizard were to come to me who said: "Your choice, either you're 25 again and completely free, but then you'll never meet Joost and not have Bente and Fitz or you're here, in the hospital, at the age of 42, recently divorced your youngest daughter with a sewn on fingertip and your oldest daughter furious, because you said stupid things." Know what I'd choose ? Well ? Without a single moment of hesitation, I'd say: I choose this. Here. Now. The thought that you and Bente wouldn't exist is unbearable. Can I hold you for a minute ? Parents have to be able to hold their children. OK, guys, let's do it. A real Christmas with trees and lights and presents and nice people and a Santa Claus. Great idea, but does the hospital allow it ? Probably not, so we'll do it in secret. If you do the decorations and we the invitations ? Who feels like having a party ? Santa Claus is coming too. Come on, that tree has to be decorated. The guests are coming in 30 minutes. I'll be right back. - Will everyone really bring snacks ? - Of course. I'm going to see mom and dad to see how they're doing. - Can you finish this ? - OK. - Adam. - Hey. - How are you ? - Good. - And you ? - Good. - Looking forward to it ? - Yes. Come on. Honey. You're having a real Christmas after all. You're Fitz, right ? - The bathroom is over there. - I'm just saying hello. Nice party in there. We did good. Are you coming ? I'll see. Don't you feel like it ? I don't care about the party. A stupid end to a stupid day. You think so ? I'm sure. I guess it is then. Yes, it's me. Yes, I'm at the entrance. Probably not, but we'll do it anyway. They deserve it. OK, see you soon. - Fitz. - Hey, Fitzie. How's it going ? - Where's mom ? - She's making a phone call outside. For work. Ho, ho, ho, time for presents. Primula. - A schoolbag ? - It's OK with Dr. Wong. Really ? And now a present for Fitz and Bente. Go and have a look. Mister Moto. Here, come. Good dog. I'm invisible. Can't you see ? Look what it says. Who could have written that ? I don't know. Maybe that girlfriend of yours. - Nikkie ? - I don't care what she's called. Nikkie is crazy. My aunt and uncle are here as well. They're here to see Benjamin. Nikkie is my cousin. I'm not in love with her, you know. I'm in love with another girl. The girl who wrote that. Tomorrow the snow's gone and it won't be there anymore. Wanna bet it will be ?
