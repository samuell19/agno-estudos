'Without Knowing Anything About Her' - Yes? - Your morning call, it's 7:45. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? Who is it? Yes, it's Brown, the lawyer. Sure I'm interested! Let me get a pen. 'Hotel...' Thanks. Thanks a million. - Let's make this quick. - Put it in second. - What a pain! - Just do it. Campari and soda, please. I'll have a cappuccino. Hello. Yes, it's me. Listen, I found the girl. I'm not coming to the office. Yes, the photographer called me. Pretty? I don't think so. She looks like a mouse. Bye. This is amusing. Looks like it's over 800,000 When the dust settles the insurers cry. The boss is happy today, isn't he? - He'll have a heart attack. - Who cares? You. You're the one who'll prove that all these people committed suicide... and we don't have to pay them a penny. Then you'll ask for a pay rise, and a post higher up the ladder. - But I know her! - Who? Maria Mancuso. The funeral was attended by the daughters Giovanna and Wanda... with their husbands; engineer Inzeppegno and accountant Indenti. - Exactly 300,000 - What a mind! She came to me a month ago to remove those two daughters from the will. Giovanna Inzeppegno and Wanda Indenti. But it's strange. It's the only announcement. And the others, the ones who'll bag 300,000? Nothing? - Why after the funeral? - It's the way. No, in this case it's what the deceased wanted... and it doesn't say that! Then, she comes to me in perfect health a month ago... excludes these two daughters from the will, probably because she doesn't like them... and there! They come to get the money. Wait! She only paid the first instalment. The second was due any time. Let me check. The second payment, including 15 days grace, expired at midnight on the 25th... This funeral announcement was for the 28th. The telegram you have there, says she died on the 25th at 10 o'clock. You don't die two hours before the second payment is due. Well? It's easy to turn the hands of a clock back a few hours... with the complicity of a doctor. Even the chief medical examiner when 300,000 is at stake. If she died just one minute after midnight, we don't have to pay them a penny. This is the first point I need to investigate. - The second point... - We'll think about the second point later. Listen, if you don't mind... - Is this the Mancuso house? - It was, they sold it. - Are any Mancuso's left? - Yes, at the back, the service entrance. Thanks. - Excuse me, Mancuso? - Round the back, the service entrance. My name's Brown, I'm from the insurance company. I was looking for one of the family. - Go on up, my sister's there. - Are you the son? Yes, round the back. The top floor. Why should I care? How do you think I feel? - You could be a little nicer. - Pass my tights, there, on the chair. Well? No, don't ask me why. You know perfectly well. Yes, I get it... but if we left immediately we could've had breakfast and come straight back. - I told you, I don't feel well. - Then see a doctor. - What did you say? - Okay, but it's the last time. Calm down! You're in a hurry, I'm not! - Anyone there? - Who is it? Brown, from the insurance company. Sorry, come in! Do you mind? Have a seat. I'll be right there. I'm sorry. I was home alone, and I was having a bath. I'm here about the life insurance policy which the lady... Which your poor mother had stipulated in favour of her children. The three youngest children because the two elder sisters were excluded from the will. - Is that right? - Yes. - Are you the youngest? - No. I wanted to know if I was speaking to the youngest or the eldest... because what I have to say may be considered embarrassing and painful, perhaps. - Tell me... - What do you want? When did you mother start to feel ill? Was it sudden, or something slow? My mother... What's going on? My lawyer, Polli. A friend of the family and curator of the deceased's will. How are you today? Will you make us a coffee? There's no need to bring lawyers into this. - We're here to pay. - He was asking me questions. You can ask me. Just go and make us a coffee. Go ahead. I was explaining that the three youngest children are the beneficiaries. We know. The lady died a few hours before... Exactly two hours before midnight on the day the second instalment was due. You have my sympathies. An instalment she wasn't going to pay, or could pay... seeing as our offices are closed at night. She could've woken a notary. Sure. - The instalment was for 250,000 - Stop trying to get out of it. These guys need money and I demand it is paid in accordance with the law. The house is sold and Orfeo must move to a city where he can continue his studies. - Medicine? - Yes, medicine, I believe. - Are they paying? - Of course they're paying. Shall we make an appointment with the notary? Yes, but in the terms of the policy all the heirs must be present. That's you, your brother Orfeo, and your sister Cinzia. - But Cinzia isn't here. - Where does it say that? Here. Have a look. Article 22. You couldn't have printed it any smaller if you tried. I know your sort. Anything to avoid paying. That's why it's all in the small print. - Is this Cinzia traceable or not? - Of course she is! Then there shouldn't be any problems. - Am I disturbing you? - Enormously! This won't take long, where can I find your sister? - She left. - Can you tell me why? For the same reason I'm going to leave as well. - Which is? - The stink. What do you mean? Didn't you notice it? The stink. You sniff out anything that stinks. That's all you're good at. - You're offending me. - I don't know. We stink, you sniff us out. After all, it's better to sniff than stink. - The body is still at the morgue. - How come? The family tomb has been seized. Must be the debts. It was already up for sale. I'd like to know the date and time the body was brought here. Let's see. - Can you also tell me the time of death? - No, we don't have that. Come, it's here. 10:15, on the 25th. Great. By law, how much time can elapse between death and a funeral? - Ask the funeral director. - I already did, you know perfectly well. 24 hours. So how do you explain how a person who died at 10:15 on the 25th.... was brought to the cemetery at 11:35 on the 27th? - You're asking me? - Of course I'm asking you. Because there are two possibilities... Either the entry in the register at the cemetery is false... - or this entry here is false. - What's going on? - He's asking me certain questions. - Who are you? My name's Brown, I work for an insurance company. What do you want? I want to check the date of death of one our policy holders. If you need information talk to our director... but you'll need authorisation from the police or from a judge. I remember clearly, they brought her here on the afternoon of the 25th. It must have been between 5 and 6, but she was already in a coma. Who else was there? A girl, maybe her daughter. Very pretty! Are you making a kite out of that telephone book? Idiot. - Then what happened? - Some relatives came. A lawyer, another daughter and some other guy, they were all shouting. They wanted to take her to a private clinic but she couldn't be moved. How do you explain the fact that the funeral took place two days later? Of course, they did the autopsy. Is anyone here? I'm here. Sure I remember you, we met on that course in 55' - Aren't you a doctor? - No, law... I was on that course for my studies. - Listen, why don't... - Then what did you do? I ended up working in insurance in Milan, that's why... I was born here and I'm still here but I can't wait to leave! About your client... I remember perfectly; Maria Mancuso. Precisely, why did you carry out an autopsy? Did you suspect foul play? No, a heart attack, it was quite clear. Actually, I remember it was the relatives who asked for it... or she had requested it in her will. The deceased requested it? I've never heard of such a thing. It isn't so rare. many of them do it for fear of apparent death. Especially women. Look, it isn't about the money. I have more than enough to think about. It's for my wife. She's a Mancuso so why should she be excluded from the policy. Unfortunately, those were the deceased's wishes. Yes, of course, you're right, and I'm sorry to trouble you... but you see I leave for New York tonight and I wanted to tell you... that we're challenging the policy. I've discussed it with my lawyer. - Yes? - Yes. Everything suggests she wasn't of sound mind; she was tired, penniless... and she lived in morally dubious surroundings. And that Orfeo, he's already been in trouble with the law because of drugs. Not even drugs, childish nonsense. That Polli? Right, after having been my mother-in-law's lover for ten years... - He leaves her like that. - For the daughter? Listen, what's your take on someone who dies so suddenly... just a few hours before the second payment is due? No. These things happen. Keep our interests also in mind and I'm sure we'll get along. It's not for me. I'm doing it for my wife. It's her money. Money she's due. Believe me, it isn't about the money. It's for sentimental reasons. You see I'm sure my mother had nothing to do with that decision. She loved all of us. There were no preferences. It's true. Quite true! - I've consulted my lawyer. - You as well? - Giovanna, isn't your husband coming? - He left for New York. Yes, I saw him today. I wanted to speak to you. Listen, I was telling you about the lawyer because... Your company will still pay out the same amount... and you're not interested in how it's divided, isn't that right? - Come and see! - Mummy doesn't want us to! To bed children! Listen, let's talk man to man. I wanted to tell you earlier, but you know what women are like. What do you think of this death? Someone changes their policy and eight days later they die. - I believe her death wasn't so natural. - I agree. I mean death may have been a liberation for her, perhaps she wanted it... - Or almost. - But she was so full of life. She had just booked an Easter cruise! A cruise? I don't think her economic situation was so... With us! She always travelled. Yes, we visited the Orient together last year. What about your sister, Cinzia? I believe that's her name. Don't mention her! It appears Cinzia disappeared soon after the funeral. - Perhaps she was in shock. - Yes, she suffered a lot. A lawyer is like a doctor, you have to tell them everything, don't you? No doubt about it seeing as I have to find her. But you don't understand, she can be very difficult, like Orfeo. I'll tell you exactly how to find Cinzia. Have you no shame? Well I'm still more normal than Orfeo and your dear little sister! Enough, Paolo! Stop acting like a fool! Thank God you're not my wife or I'd hit you so hard! They're talking. Got it? You got it? They're all talking! The Mancuso's are very proud. Then it ends up in the papers. You want to see Cinzia? I'll show you! He could have seen it as well. They're all talking so you have to know the truth. Here's the last of the Mancuso's. - Has Ms. Mancuso returned? - She doesn't live here any more. - I just saw her leave. - Yes, she paid the bill and checked out. Let me see, are you nude? How much do they pay you? What do you care? Mind your own business. He's crazy! Ignore him. She isn't here. - The photographer? - The one we're looking for. - Listen, let's go. - Unless these two will do. - Idiot! - Show him your photos. Cut it out! You're like a little boy. Come on, it's raining. - Is this photographer coming? - Yes, but he's always late. Do you have an appointment? Listen, lawyer, you go. I'll wait for her. I'm talking to you! You don't need to do anything. You don't need to look for anyone, you just need to pay, pay! You're either drunk or high. None of the two. Listen, I'm here to bring Cinzia back home. I know you're being paid to make sure we don't get our share... but you're wasting your time. My sister's a good girl. I'll take care of her. Stay out of it. Have you found the girl? Yes, and if you see her don't tell her I was here, okay? I'll be silent as a photograph! Do you want a ride? Look, it's raining. I'm going to the centre, I can leave you at a taxi rank. Well, what do you say? Would you mind? Thanks. Where are you going? Leave me where you want. No, I want to take you where you want to go. - You're very kind. - I try. Left or right? Right... No, left! Lady, if you don't know where you're going then we're in trouble. You're right, I'm sorry. But I really don't. - What? - Know where I'm going. - Are you from Milan? - No. Then tell me where you're going and I'll take you. Why? Do you charge? Pardon? - Not a bad idea! - Sorry. Not at all. Listen, am I mistaken or has something happened to you? Why? Nothing, it's just that you looked like you were in a hurry before... then you stopped in the middle of the road, like you wanted to get wet. Right, I must have seemed a bit crazy. It's just that there was someone there I didn't want to meet. Listen, the smartest thing you can do now is get changed, you're all wet. Yes, you're right. Pull over. Here? If you really want to help, can you take me to the station? - Is it too far? - Heavens no, it's just here. You'll be doing me a favour, I might even avoid falling ill... I'm starting to feel cold. I also go to the station when I'm cold, it's a delightful place. Those people who go to Morocco or the Riviera, they make me laugh! I always go to the station. It's true you know. New Year's at the station. Ever celebrated New Year's at the station? - No. - Why it's wonderful! I never miss it. Have a pleasant trip. You haven't forgotten anything? It was very kind of you to take me here. The seat's all wet! It will remind me of you. At least until it dries. Not for long then! What are you doing here? Is it New Year already? What have you done? I got changed. - Don't you like it? - Very pretty, I didn't recognise you. - What are you doing? Leaving? - No, I changed, now I'm putting it back. No, you have to explain. How long have you been in Milan? A few days. And every time you have to change or brush your teeth? - I keep my toothbrush in my pocket. - And your wardrobe at the station! - It's impossible. - Why not? It's perfectly possible. Listen, I'm 37 and my name's Nanni Brown... Employed, graduated in law, single, and I have a clean rap sheet! The last time I chased a girl I was 18 and still in high school. I was meant to go to the office this morning but I'm here. There, I've said everything. - I don't understand. - I thought it was obvious. - Let me buy you breakfast. - I don't see why. Right, of course, I'm a lunatic. Sorry but I still think you should. - Please forgive me. - Listen... Why are you apologising, you haven't offended me. You're right, I shouldn't apologise to you, but to myself. I made myself look ridiculous. Believe me, the last time I approached a woman... You told me, you were still in high school. It's just that you surprised me. I mean, it was very kind of you to give me a ride... but I didn't realise I made such an impression on you. - You didn't even look at me. - No, you're mistaken. The woman I offered a ride to was wearing a brown jacket... a scarf of the same colour... and she was wearing strange boots and bag on her shoulder. The woman I offered a ride to appeared rather confident. Truth is, she's shy, anxious, on the defensive. I deduced this watching her hands, which were always clenched. So I have no idea if she paints her nails or not... but I'm sure she doesn't. Still want to have breakfast together? Please. I'll see if the cleaning lady has been. The house is ready! Give it to me. Have a seat. Hungry? - It's nice here. - Better than the station? - Where's the kitchen? - No, no... Sorry, but I'm the cook. You stay here. Anyway, cooking is child's play with all this modern technology. Sit here and wait. Now close your eyes. You'll only open them when I say so. I'm sorry. What's that? You've never heard a telephone ring? - Why don't you answer it? - I don't want the office to know I'm here. Lawyer Brown? What are you doing? Are you at home? Are you sick? Heavens no, I'm absolutely fine. I'm with a woman. I'm devouring her breasts! Cut it out! What if it isn't the office. Then it doesn't matter, so I'm still not going to answer it. - I can't bear it. - Okay, this is what we'll do. I heard a click. He must have disconnected it. No, the line's probably down. There was no answer. You heard it as well. - He won't be home now. - Then let's try again, the number? I'll call, I told you I can't give out our employees numbers. - It's to protect their privacy. - To protect what? Their privacy! Great, an accountant's privacy. We all have the right to mind our own business at home... because it suits the boss at the office. Isn't that right? I'm sorry, dear, but I really must call the office. I like your house. I'm not saying it's beautiful, but I like it. I feel so relaxed. Like I've been here before. It's engaged. Sorry, dear, will you get my nightdress from the wardrobe. The suitcase, in the corridor! - It doesn't matter, I found it. - I didn't know you were a model. Leave that alone! - Don't tear them up, they're nice. - No, they're horrible. No! - You like them? - Sure, they're pretty. Pier Luigi Magni, Photography Studio. Nice place. - You're one of those women who... - No, I'm not one of those. I heard you could make a lot of money posing nude. I was desperate. - Are you very poor? - I think so... But it doesn't matter any more, I don't need to be rich. And earning a living isn't a problem. But my mother, she couldn't live poor. She couldn't even grasp the concept. I know you'll think badly of me but I'll tell you anyway. My mother died a week ago. - I loved her. - Sure, I believe you. No, you don't. You don't believe me at all. A woman doesn't sleep with a man, a week later. Actually, they do. They've written books about it. You react to death with an act of vitality. And the fact that you've lost your parents... has given you an instinctive need for protection. You're crying. No. I'm not crying. You don't have anyone. I have a brother I adore, but the others... Let's not talk about me, it isn't a happy topic. Make your calls. I'll get dressed. Then I'll go. You don't just have a brother. You also have three sisters, two married, and one single. How do you know? I know a lot of things about your family. I work for an insurance company. Your mother had a life insurance policy worth 300 million. I don't want that money! I don't want it! What's got into you? Let me explain. Why didn't you tell me who you were, and what you wanted from me? Does it matter? I'd have preferred to meet you by chance. You know what I mean. I was ordered to find you. I got your address from that photographer. Your relatives had already shown me your photo. So I followed you. But even if I'd met you by chance it would still have been the same. I'm sorry. You're upset. - No. - Yes. Well I'm not. I'm not upset. It doesn't change anything. I told you. - I'm going to have a bath, may I? - Sure! - You make your calls. - I have some great bath salts! No thanks, I don't need anything! Go away! Hello? Ms. Liberani, please. Then interrupt her, it's urgent. Hi, it's me. Yes, I'm with the girl. No, I'm not at home. I have to whisper, she's close by. Listen, tell the boss Brown is about to close a deal worth 300 million. No, we can't meet tonight. I'm telling you I can't. Bye. I forgot to give you a towel. Open the door so I can pass you a towel. Say something! Open the door, I'll give you the towel. What's going on? Are you okay? Open the door! Listen, you can't... What's going on? If you don't say something I'll smash the door in! Please give me a moment. - Elvira, my bag. - She'll catch a cold. Then put something on. - Get me some plasma. - Where shall I bring it? - Where shall I bring it? - Apartment 8, second floor. - If someone comes? - They can wait, and bring me the plasma. What happened? Did you hear? 5 - 7- 2- 3 - 3 -3 - What is it? - The number for an ambulance. Tell them it's for doctor Farrone. 5 - 7- 2- 3 - 3 -3 Is it really necessary? Yes, she needs to recover, and you can't shoulder the responsibility. A pair of scissors, please. First things first, get dressed. Here's the plasma. Wait, take this as well. - Do you need me? - No, thanks. - What do I tell them? - I'm on my way. Clean this, please. Well, are you going to call that ambulance? Tell me the truth. Is it life threatening? No. The intention was there. She wasn't fooling around. I mean, the girl was serious and she cut with energy... but it isn't just a matter of cutting the veins. Above all... you have to cut them in the right spot. She was treated immediately. So she didn't have time to lose a lot of blood. It isn't a lot. Blood frightens you. Hold still, my dear. There you go. Listen, if you assure me there's no danger, I'd rather keep her here. I'll explain later. It's a delicate matter and very important. - Is she married? - No, it's not that. Then why take the risk? I can't assure you of anything, you'll need to watch her for the next few hours. Haemorrhaging aside, she may well try it again. But I'm here, and I won't leave her for a moment. - Besides, you're close by. - No, I have my visits. Untie me, please. I don't want to go through that again tonight. I understand your situation. I'm not saying no. But call the ambulance. Listen to me. She's awake. She looks very pale. It looks like she's suffering. - Doctor? - Don't worry about that. - Is she better? - She's better than both of us! She'll sleep soundly until tomorrow. When she wakes up, you'll say: "I'll marry you!" The unscrupulous ones, they all want to marry them. - Why don't you change the sheets? - I thought she couldn't be moved. I'll do it now. Follow my instructions. Lift her up, slide the sheet out. There, like that. - Why did you disconnect the phone? - I didn't want us to be disturbed. I gave out this number for urgent calls. I told you. What? Who was that? What's going on? I'm going crazy! The Mancuso boy hassling me, you disappearing! Who answered the phone? A doctor... No, a friend. No, I'm fine. I'd like to be left alone. - Listen, I'm leaving. - I'll call you tomorrow. - You're leaving me alone? - You can call if you need me. We live in the same building. What are you doing? Why did you get up? I'm leaving. You're staying here until the doctor comes! Go back to bed! Just leave me alone! You really are crazy. You'll get me into trouble. Go away and let me get dressed. Calm down. What is this all about? - I want to get out of here! - You think I want to keep you here? I'll take you if you like. To the police station at the hospital. We'll file a report and I'll say goodbye. If anything happens I'm responsible, and my doctor friend who kept this quiet. I'll send you to someone. Perhaps even your family... but I won't take responsibility. You can't even stand up. Listen to me, suicide is an offence, just like any other crime. How do I know you won't try again? And I have to take the rap because I didn't tell anyone? What if you fall ill? You've lost a lot of blood. Have a look at the mess, apart from the fright you gave me! It was quite a night! Lunacy! I could've almost dreamt it. We were doing so well. - I'm sorry. - Right. Well how about an explanation? Why did you do it? I don't know. When... When you said you followed me, not because you liked me... but because of the insurance claim. - I felt ridiculed. - No, my dear, I don't buy it. Madam, I work for an insurance company, and then you slash your wrists! Who are you kidding? Why? What are you hiding from the insurance company? It can only benefit you. I looked for you because you stand to collect a lot of money from us. - Yes, but I don't want the money. - Then don't take it. Give it to your brother, who seems so impatient to collect his share, and yours. - Why won't you tell me the truth? - I told you the truth. I don't know. Well, yes, I know but... It's hard to explain. We're an unlucky family. That's the word; unlucky. and I felt deceived by everyone, one after the other. That's why I left. I don't want to see anyone, not even my brother. I would've happily gone with you, because I was happy as well. I thought I could start a new life with you. But you tricked me as well. You appeared like a cop sent by my family to stop me from forgetting everything. You know you have quite an imagination. How could you mistake me for a cop? It's never happened to me before. - No, I didn't say that. - Yes, you did. Right, evidently, you're suffering from severe nervous exhaustion. If it wasn't me, you would have run off with someone else. In a moment of discomfort. No doubt it's happened before. I'm not fooling myself. If you had felt for me what I felt for you... An extraordinary attraction. Complete. - I felt it, too. - Enough to cut your wrists? No, you behaved like a drug addict who wakes up in a stranger's bed... - It's repulsive. - Don't say that. But that's how it is. Unless you're trying to hide something. Who knows? Perhaps in your family. Isn't it worth finding out? Good morning, doctor. Yes, she's already on her feet. I found her dressed and ready to go out. Of course, I was just telling her I'd prefer to report this... All above board. I'll take her there myself... Hello? Doctor? Listen, I want to thank you for everything you've done. I'm perfectly fine. I just made a fool of myself, you've helped me understand the consequences. Okay. Thanks. Don't leave me alone today. Why don't we go out? It's Sunday, you don't have to work, let's get out of the city. I need to. I can't stay here. Just the two of us. - How about the station? - Why not? The station! We can start over, you invite me to breakfast... and I'll say, where can we go? No, you'll say that. And I'll say, let's go... Shall I choose? Do you want to? Let's go. It's members only. You need an invitation just to dine here, like all these clubs. - It's strange you've never been here. - The opposite would be strange. They're upmarket places I don't frequent. - I'm a modest employee. - I don't think it's expensive. Maybe it is. I don't know. Perhaps you're right, everything my mother did was tremendously expensive. She was a member for years, but she only came here once or twice. Me and Orfeo took full advantage! When we came to Milan, staying here was the cheapest option. - We just had to sign the bill. - But the bills catch up with you eventually. And the later they come, the bigger they are. - Aren't you tired pacing around? - No, I'm fine. Your friend said so, that doctor Farrone. Listen, do you like the smell of damp earth? I do. I don't know. Tell me about yourself. You must have a lover. A girlfriend, some old flames. Okay, you've got your bachelor pad... But when you take them out... Where do you go? I have a lover. Well, I had one. It's been dragging on for a year without much conviction from either side. A nice woman, married. Separated. She's asked for an annulment. To marry you? Do you see her everyday? We see each other everyday because she works in my office. Sometimes it's the cinema, or the theatre, we dine at home. - At your place? - Yes. Why don't you live together? Haven't you ever lived together? No, neither of us wanted to, you know how it is. Miserable, very miserable. Miserable, I won't deny it. My entire life is miserable, if that's the case. No great achievements, I've never travelled far. Just the ones everyone else has already done. I know a lot of people, but I have few friends. And work... I wanted to be a famous penal lawyer. And that meant hard work. So I've failed as a lawyer and as an insurer. There's still time. You see, in my profession... Either you're a manager who can set up a big deal... or you land a case that gets you noticed. Getting the boss' attention, if only for a day. What do you mean? Take the example of my American colleague... By chance, completely by chance... He found out that an airline disaster which killed hundreds of people... was provoked by a passenger who wanted to kill himself... so his family could collect a lucrative insurance policy. Nobody would have thought of it. He was the only one, and he proved it beyond doubt. From that day he was considered a genius. But it's just an example, just one example of success. A success in what way? The passenger had an insurance policy but they don't pay if it's suicide. Like always. The insurers proved it was suicide so they didn't pay. The colleague saved his company a few million. A big success. - You're pale, what's wrong? - I'm fine. Shall we go back? Yes, let's go back. - My respects. - Thank you, Carlo. Are you coming? Poor lady, I had the honour of serving her a year ago. It must have been this season. A real lady. - Are you stopping for breakfast? - I don't know, is it busy? There's no-one here now, perhaps up at the club. - Shall I prepare your usual table? - Thank you. I'll call you when it's ready. Listen, what do you want to do? Would you prefer to go? Let's do something else, you go, I'll stay. I'll have a sandwich then I'll go to bed. I'll stay a couple of days. Doesn't it seem like the best solution? It does to me. We won't bother each other. - Isn't that right? - If you say so. Why? Don't you have an opinion? - Admit it, you're behaving strangely. - Yes, perhaps. The truth is, I don't know how we can start over. I thought something happened between us, or not? Or is sleeping with a man like drinking a glass of water to you? And cutting your wrists is a habit, I don't know, like brushing your teeth. No! We're strolling around here like two fools. Talking about my sordid affairs and my work in the office. Let's talk about you. About what happened to you... and what happened to us, and why it went like that. We've done nothing but talk about us. Don't pretend you don't understand, you understood perfectly well. What does he want? He wants to give us something to eat? Then hurry up! As long as we leave. We brought the wine your brother always asked for. Orfeo thinks he's a wine expert. I don't think he is, he hardly drinks. - Poor Orfeo. - Shall I open it? Yes, sure. You want some? I'd like a beer, thanks. Try to be patient with me. I'm sorry, dear. I know, I'm stupid, selfish, and irritating. Then what happens? A man with all these defects... winds up with an extraordinary woman like you. I want to be patient, because I love you, believe me. And I want to help you. I don't know but I'd give anything to understand what torments you... What you feel for me. What is it that makes you suffer? What is it that pushed you... This morning, you told me you were happy with me. But I... Did you notice? I didn't have the courage to kiss you any more. I was scared I'd find out it wasn't real. And I was scared I'd lose you. You're really scared? Shall we go somewhere where we can be alone? I want to. See, it's real. It's real! This one? This one? The lady has awkward tastes. This one? This one. Isn't the silence beautiful? We're alone in the world. Tell me why I feel so relaxed when I'm in your arms. So relaxed! I don't want to get up any more. Scared? Listen, why don't we stay here for a few days. It's okay, we'll get out of bed sometimes. Or we can go somewhere else if you don't like it here. - But let's get away! - Great idea, then they'll fire me. How will I support you? First I need to get used to the idea of being supported by a rich wife. - And I'd be the rich wife. - Right. I never dared tell you... As soon as I saw you I said to myself... That woman is going to be my wife. That's very kind of you. But you're forgetting one thing... I'm not rich. I thought I told you that. I feel sorry for you, but I prefer it this way. It's the first time someone's asked me to marry them. How am I meant to behave? Should I thank you? Or should I say, marriage is very serious... it lasts a lifetime. Give it some thought. You're crazy! You don't ask a woman to marry you without knowing anything about her. - But I know everything about you. - You think so? - We're not getting married, my love. - Why? I know, I feel it, and it's nice that you say it. It's nice you even thought it. Perhaps because you thought that right from the start... I felt calm, I liked being with you. I can't remember the last time I felt like that. When I was little and my father was alive. Then it all just got worse. Since my mother... committed suicide. Because she committed suicide. That's the truth. She committed suicide. What you're saying is very serious, dear. I know. Of course, given the circumstances, it's understandable that the family... want to be discreet. But let's face facts here. I mean regarding the insurance company. I already told you I don't want that money. I wish I'd never told you. You, yes. Fine. But the others? They've done everything to collect. You know yourself this adds up to fraud. I know. That's why I was so nervous. I swear I don't understand them. But don't worry. I'll make sure they don't get away with it. Besides, they can't collect without my signature. You said so yourself. But your sisters, the married ones, do they know your mother... No, how could they? Anyway, they're not due anything. - But Pia and Orfeo. - And Polli? - Pia, Orfeo and Polli know everything. - Yes, they know everything. Just leave it up to me, they're not bad people. Orfeo's just a spoilt kid. He's like mother, he can't live without money. He loved her so much, but now she's dead... When there's a lot of money at stake you're going to try and get it. - Where did you come from? The moon? - Is he busy? If you're interested, I have some important things to tell you. Not as much as this. Give me a minute. - Are you sure? - I'm certain! - How do you explain the autopsy? - They never did a toxicology test. - We must ask for it right away. - It seems fundamental. Don't worry, I'm telling you the daughter's ready to testify. Did she give you a written declaration? We'll have that as well, have some patience. We're officially authorised to suspend payment... because of a declaration given to me by one of the interested parties. - And that's a fundamental point. - Let me deal with this. Ms. Mancuso just called. - I don't know if you're interested. - Why didn't you call me? Because you seemed to have more urgent matters to attend to. I'll be the judge of that. A minute won't change anything, you're a real rogue... for the way you treated me on Saturday night, how you disappeared yesterday... for how you just treated me. As you can see, that took less than a minute. And now, call whoever you want. Is that what was so urgent? The most urgent. Then I had my Sunday ruined by that Mancuso boy... who insists you know where his sister is. Indeed, she's at my apartment. So I was right. Who's speaking? - You gave him my address. - Address and telephone number. - You really messed up! - Why? And you don't? I didn't show myself because I couldn't. Who are you kidding? The time it takes to call. - You just have to want to. - I didn't want to. That's what I wanted to hear you say. It's over. Who am I speaking to? Who are you? Put Ms. Mancuso on! What? Who are you? I have every right to ask seeing as she's in my house. - Get out! - Yes, to report you to the police. Okay, we'll go together. It's obvious you're trying to swindle us. Then listen to what Cinzia has to tell you. What do you have to tell me, dear? You can tell me everything. Don't talk to her like that. Your private affairs don't interest me. Shall we talk about yours? Everybody out, I want to talk to this gentleman. Don't let them frighten you, this is your house now, and you know it. Come with me, Cinzia. With you? Whatever you have to say, please tell me. He only used you to hurt us. To get out of paying the insurance policy... you persuaded this woman, against all truth... to declare that her mother committed suicide. Lady Mancuso, their mother, didn't kill herself. I don't see why I should listen to you any more... rather than a woman who has no interest in telling me what she said. Forget it. You have the autopsy results, you've investigated... and you know it happened exactly as I say. So you decided to prey on her because she's weak. We're filing a report for the attempted suicide which your doctor failed to do. I'd like to know which court won't recognise the poor mental state... of a girl who comes from a good family who behaves like this wretch. Leave. Yes, I'll leave. I've said all I need to say. What is this all about? I believe in you. - This is getting pathetic. - You can leave as well. Yes, but with her. - Where are your things? - In the corridor. Please stay. There was only one way your company wasn't going to pay up on the policy... and you tried, unsuccessfully. What a sad story. Continue, Continue with your investigation. We're going to report you. I don't think you lied to me. Well I did. My mother... - She didn't kill herself. - I don't believe it, I'll never believe it. I'm going to Livorno, and I'll prove it. Even without your testimony. - Well? - They already did the autopsy. Sure they did, now we want another one with a toxicology test. - I have a request to exhume the body. - No, it seems they did a second one. That's impossible. - When did they do it? - Yesterday. But it's still the same autopsy, who else would have requested it? Excuse me, that guy you're looking for, Segantini, he's out here. It doesn't matter any more. Come in. The autopsy you're interested in has already been done. Yes, I know, but without a toxicology test. With a toxicology test. I have the report here. - It was done yesterday morning. - Yesterday morning? - So they did a second one? - Exactly. What were the results? Did you find anything? I'm sorry, I can't say, the report has been sent to the judicial authorities. I'm sorry, but could you at least tell me who requested the second autopsy? You don't know? It would have been the investigating judge. Thanks, good day. - So, you didn't go to New York. - Right, as you can see, no. - And, as you can see, I'm here as well. - And for the same reason. What do you know about your autopsy? - Unfortunately, the poor lady... - Yes, I knew it was suicide. It wasn't suicide. They killed her. How do you know? Someone gave her an injection, and that someone... Allow me to introduce my lawyer. We've always suspected Orfeo. Now we have proof. A chance encounter? - I was coming to see you. - You here to spy on me? I don't even know why I came. I wanted you. Either way, it's best you know... Your brother-in-law has figured it all out. It went badly for me, but also for your brother, and his accomplices. It really wasn't worth you trying to save him. That's why you lied to me. To save them. It wasn't them. I did it, I killed her. I don't believe you. Well it's true. I did it, but I didn't know about the insurance policy. She wanted to die. She couldn't live poor, and old. Then there was that story with her lover. Poor mum. She had already done the first injections. But she didn't have the courage to do the others. She begged me. She was desperate. I thought, that if I didn't help her... she would have killed herself anyway. I did it out of pity. I don't know how to explain it. In that moment, I felt like I had to do what she said. - It seemed right. - Do the others know? So it turns out that the sinister trio... your brother, your sister and her lover, are the angels... doing everything they can to protect you. - They want the money. - They'd still get it. If your mother was murdered, we'll pay. You'll go to prison, and they'll collect. But they're in a hurry. And a trial could go on for years, and block the payment. Besides... They could always try to prove that mother did the injections herself. That she committed suicide. I have a letter, in which mother declares... - That she committed suicide. - Yes. She says she wanted to commit suicide. Why she's doing it, and to destroy the letter after. - But you didn't destroy it. - No. Do you plan on using it? What do you think? - Where are we going? - To see a friend, he's a lawyer. I think we can still fix everything with that letter. You might not go to prison, and I might be able to save that 300 million. You should have told me sooner, but we'll pull through. You don't get it. I don't care about going to prison. That isn't why I'm so upset. - I haven't told you everything. - What else is there? Nothing, don't worry. In the moment, I did what mother wanted. It felt like I was doing the right thing. I was excited. But after it was terrible. Because, when she felt she was slipping away... That same violence pleaded with me to save her. And I found myself alone. Try not to think about it. I needed someone who could understand what had happened to me. Someone who'd forgive me. The money, prison, what does it mean? - The problem is something else. - It's easy to say, my dear. You didn't turn yourself in. We're all good at burying our faults under a mountain of complicated emotions. Take me, for example. I courted you because I wanted to find out the truth about your mother's death. I even managed to sleep with you. All completely planned. So I was to blame. But I managed to convince myself it wasn't true. Because I like you, because I thought I was in love. And maybe I still am. But the facts don't change, for me, or you. - The facts, facts... - Yes dear, listen to me. Let's be realistic. If your mother wanted to commit suicide, her letter is precious. Let's go to lawyer Castelli right now. Why? I told you, if we can prove it was suicide, we can save ourselves. Come on, let's go. Can I drive? It will help me relax. I'm a good driver. As you wish. Kiss me. I don't know how it happened. I don't get it. They were on my right, driving fast. They came straight at me! They did it on purpose! I ran straight over but he was already dead. The woman was driving. She's badly injured but she might make it, right? She's very young. I've never had an accident, never. They came straight at me. Believe me, there was nothing I could do.
