Hear me, brother Hear me, sister The garbage truck is here Take out the trash The garbage truck is here Take out the trash Do not litter Do not make excuses The garbage truck is here Take out the trash The garbage truck is here Take out the trash Shubham! Shubham! Grandpa, a little to the left. No, I mean, to your right. Grandpa! Look at me. The light's coming in from that direction, so-- Why don't you find yourself a girlfriend and click her photos? Clicking my photos is pointless. Grandpa, you are 86. I'll frame one and hang it on the wall after you're gone. Don't even think about it, son. I am going to hit a century. You want to bet? How convenient. Even if I win, who will pay me? All right, let's take another shot. -Shubhu. -Hold still. Shubhu! -Hold it, Grandpa. -Shubhu! Mom! Take out the trash. Hurry up, you'll miss the truck there. And I'll miss the light here. Why don't you do it? Hear me, brother Hear me, sister The garbage truck is here Take out the trash... Shubham! Nobody respects an artist. -Going deaf, are you? -No, I was just... Vaishali... what's a four-letter word for "wealthy"? It begins with an "R". -"Rich." -R-I-C-H. Which we aren't. Hey, stop! Stop! Hey! You cannot do anything right. -You had one job-- -He didn't stop, Dad. Because you weren't there. No, I-- I was there the other day. He never stops for anybody. We should just slip him a hundred. -What? -I mean, you... I should give him a hundred bucks? Have you ever earned a penny in your life? All you do is fiddle around with that camera. Feel free to donate him thousands when you start earning. Ready for work? Look at her. She's two years younger than you. Yet, she earns a living. Go ahead. Ride carefully. Good day! I won't give him a single penny. It's his job. The municipality pays him every month. And we pay him a generous tip every Diwali. He's not doing us a favour. -You know what? Just stay out. -What? And don't come back until you dump the trash. Bye, King of Crap! Congratulations, Mr. Gupchup. Your final instalment is deposited as well. Now you can withdraw all your money along with the interest amount in a year. -16%, right? -Absolutely, sir. -I've done my research. -That's great, sir. Thank you. Thank you, sir. See you soon. -In a year. -Sure, sir. Dad. Let's go. You're a photographer, right? Can't you differentiate between colours? It's still red. Why did you stop? Come on, let's go! Dad, no one else is waiting. The police isn't here either. So, you're going to follow the herd, aren't you? Oh, God! Get down. -What? -Get down! What happened? You seem to be in a hurry. You walk home. Dad, I-- Go on, you're in a hurry, aren't you? -I'll get there before you do. -I'm sure you will. The world's racing ahead and he's stuck at his moral junction! WISHING A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE HONOURABLE MR. PURUSHOTTAM MEHENDALE Zardozi lehenga. Mom, Shubham is calling! Hello. Ketaki, lower the volume. Why don't you go out and talk? What? What! Dad? Dad? It'll cost Rs. 2.5 lakh for the surgery. And they will do it only after we pay them. Oh, God! Mom, everything will be all right. The doctor said it, didn't he? Don't you believe him? Praise the Lord. EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT DON'T YOU WORRY Note it down. Rs. 40,000... from Mrs. Palkar. Palkar? Who is she? Varsha's friend. She is a moneylender. Really? How come I don't know her? Why should you? Exactly. Just note it down! And Rs. 30,000 from Varsha. So, the total is Rs. 60,000. Rs. 70,000, idiot! Hey... -Don't poke your nose in! -Don't try to act smart-- Don't try to act too smart. Mom, did they pay you for your order? No. I will ask about it. Did you ask your colleagues? I did speak to a few, but... Varsha was going to get me some orders. I hope I get an advance from her. All of this, along with Dad's insurance, still won't be enough. I was thinking-- Mom, what about the fund? Your dad won't agree. Mom, my client can-- -Shubhu. -Yes? Do me a favour. Ask Grandpa if he can lend us some money. Why don't you ask me? I am a part of this family! Oh, really? How much? I need to talk to my client. Okay, talk to him. But first, ask your grandpa. Go. Shubhu! As of midnight... that is... as of November 8, 2016... Mom! ...12 a.m. onwards... the ongoing usage of Rs. 500 notes and Rs. 1,000 notes will be considered illegal. "Shock: A sudden disturbance in a series of events." S-H-O-C-K. K.E.M. "People with black money are in a huge dilemma. Will this hit make the country better? Will this end corruption?" Good times are finally here, Pramod. All the corrupt men will be caught soon. Have some. Mehendale is gone. When did he die? I am talking about demonetization. Mehendale is in trouble. He'll be thrown out of the party and will be jailed as well. Bloody corrupt fellow. What's wrong? The money we collected for your surgery... is all in cash. They're old currency notes. That's okay. The hospital will accept them. Don't you read the newspaper? We couldn't come up with the entire amount. I can't ask Varsha to lend me more. I mean, she was going to ask someone else. But I don't think anyone will lend us money. Let's wait for some time. And what about your back? Stop worrying about my back. What do we do? Shubhu... Shall we withdraw money from the fund? I... I need to make a call. Sure. Dad. Vaishali. We can't withdraw money from the fund. We barely managed to pay the instalments. We'd lose out the entire interest. And we'll have to pay a fine. Had it been an emergency, I wouldn't have stopped you. It is an emergency. Don't you remember? Shobha's husband had delayed his surgery too. -And then... -He died, Dad. You fool! It was a heart surgery. How does that even matter? You never listen. Hold on. Dad, please listen to me. What if there are complications? -What if they have to amputate-- -Shut up! -Please don't say that. -But I... Give it to me. All right. Withdraw the money. Shubhu... Shubhu! Let's go, Mom. KALPATRU MONEY-GROWTH SCHEME Mom, let's go. I told him not to invest in that fund! They are all frauds! But no! "Shubham, you're an idiot! I've done my research." Research, my ass! So... we lost our money? No, we didn't. So tell me why that office was shut. Tell me! Maybe they didn't have any money. How could they have faced their investors? -What do we do? -As usual... I will have to do something. Really? -You think I can't? -Then we're doomed. You think you're the only responsible child? -I have contacts, okay? I-- -Shubhu, shut up! -Mom-- -Shut up! Don't listen to that friend of yours and cause further trouble! Do you get it? Who? Paresh? She can't even chop vegetables. I told them not to invest in that fund but nobody listens to me! They didn't even bother asking me for help while collecting money for Dad's surgery. Do you have money? No. So why would they ask you? It's basic courtesy, Paresh! Nobody respects me! Any reason they should? -You ass! -You pansy! In fact, "Pansy" is the apt name for you. In school, you were always scared of the teachers. At home, you are always scared of your father. And now what? You are scared of the freakin' government. Paresh, I am serious! Who will lend me money for Dad's surgery? First, hold this. You need money, right? You will get it. But you'll need to grow some balls! If Dad finds out, all hell will break loose. "If Dad finds out, all hell will break loose." Tell me something. You abuse your dad all the time. And when it's time to do something on your own, you are using him as an excuse. You should actually change your name to "Pansy"! -What do I need to do? -Are you sure? Another peg? Sure. Sir, it's an original. An original copy of Ray-Ban. How do I look? Here you go. It has all the details of mine and Grandpa's account. Okay. Does your family know? Do I have "moron" written over my face? Hold on. Yeah. But it's misspelled. Paresh, how much money will I get? Look... The money will get deposited in your account. You can keep your share. -I will let you know about the rest. -Tell me now! All right, man. You can keep Rs. 10,000 out of the Rs. 50,000. Really? Yes. That means... Paresh, we won't get in trouble, right? Oh, God! -No, I mean-- -I knew it! Look at him. His business is illegal. His shop is illegal. All his products are fake. Yet, he isn't scared of anyone! So, why are you? -Do you want to prove yourself? -Yeah! -So, man up, buddy! -Yeah! Good. Don't worry, Dad. It's a minor surgery. Where is Shubham? -Roaming around. -Shut up. You won't believe it, but he has become a responsible man now. Everything happens for the best. -Dad! -Sorry. -There you are. -Hold on. Your mother was singing your praises. She said you've become responsible. Did you arrange for the money? It's such a huge amount. Where did you get it from? Did you rob somebody? What are you saying? It was due from the client. Such a big amount? Yes, it was an overdue payment. Why would I lie to you? Who is this client? He is... Tell me his name. He doesn't even remember the name. No, it's just... I have so many clients. Let it be. Why are you troubling him? Let's go. He is lying. This way. He took so long. -Let's go, Pramod. -Did you take the file? Pramod, wait! Shubham! He did all of this for you. Shubhu, come on. Get in. Dad, please listen to me. The surgery was important, that's why... I didn't steal. Mom, tell him! I didn't do anything wrong. Really? Did you hear him? "Didn't do anything wrong." I know he swindled! Corrupt people do such things to avoid paying tax! I can't believe my son chose to do this. If I knew, I wouldn't have agreed to the surgery. We've finally been blessed with a good government. It's taking serious steps against corruption. But people like you... Asshole! What did you say? -Stop the car. -Why? Why are you creating a scene? Keep quiet, Vaishali! -Dad, I am sorry-- -Shut up! Pramod, go back. -You sure? -Yes. This rascal has become a citizen committee member? After all, he does a lot of charity. Became a star in the eyes of the party. And how does he source the money for all that charity? I'm sure the party's eyes are shut to that. Does the party not give two hoots for honest and sincere candidates like us? -It does. -What? Look over there. Is that me? You are the senior candidate of the party. Of course you're on the billboard. It's people like you who support such corrupt people. -What did I do? -Remember! Justice is delayed but never denied, Shubham. Shortcuts are easy but they force you to go down the wrong path. We do not have such principles. I had plenty of opportunities to earn quick money. But I never did anything wrong. Did I, Pramod? Why? Because of my principles. My heart is in a dilemma My life is at risk Praise the Lord Love without letting anyone know Read it and say it aloud Read it and say it aloud Read it and say it aloud Open the windows Listen to me, everyone What's going on? Sing a song for me, my dear Come here quickly The cage is ready Come here quickly The trap is ready From inside the cage A monkey will come out A monkey will come out A monkey crazy in love Come on, sonny Read it and say it aloud Read it and say it aloud Read it and say it aloud Open the windows... Vaishali! Are you ready? Pramod is already on his way. I did say we should leave early. The highway must be jammed. Dad, let's take the back route. It's a shortcut. It's always clear. You better clear out the trash via the front door. Let me decide which route to take for all of us. Hurry up! Hear me, brother Hear me, sister The garbage truck is here Take out... My beloved My beloved Hi, baby. I'm about to leave. I'll be there in ten minutes. Right across the coffee shop. Move it. Please move. Go on. Vaishali! Vaishali! Did you see that? That was Mehendale. So? What do you mean "so"? He came after us but got in before. Bloody corrupt fellow! Why is he driving like that? You ass! Shubham! Go slow. It's not our car. We have to return it to Pramod. Why don't you tell him to drive safely? Did you hear me? What do I say? That fraud Mehendale ought to be in jail right now! But he was sitting right next to the Lord. And us? We had to pray from afar. -That's the way it is, Dad. -No, it isn't! Who said so? And mark my words, all of this will stop now! The wave of change has arrived. People like Mehendale will rot behind bars. The age of the virtuous is upon us. -I don't agree! -Really? As if your opinion matters! Who listens to you? Nobody listens to you either! -The world doesn't follow your path. -Shubham! Let him say what he wants to. New blood. New voice. This is the future, isn't it? Let us hear why he agreed to let them deposit money in his account. Your surgery wouldn't have happened without that money! Oh, really? And my being ethical won't change a thing! Shubham! It's the truth, Mom! It is the truth! Everyone knows that Mehendale is corrupt. -He should be jailed! -Yes! But where is he, Dad? He is heading the citizen committee! Who gets the VIP treatment at the temple? Mehendale. And where are we? Tell me. You believe in following the rules, right? You didn't run the red light, but somebody ran over you! I am telling you. There's no place for "goodness" in this world anymore. Hey, you... Hey! Hey! Hey! Shubhu, pass him some water. Are you hurt? Get him some water. Will you? -Shubhu! -Mom! Is it bad? Tilt up your head! Where is he going? Shubham! Hey... Shubham. What happened? Oh, Lord. Shubham, let's go! Shubham. Shubham. What are you doing? Don't touch it. Dad, look at all the money! It's not ours to take. We aren't thieves, Shubham. Come on. Your mom's waiting for us. Let's go. Listen to me! Fine, I'm going! Come with me. -Where were you? -Get in the car. Where is Shubham? Just get in! Shubhu! Where did you get this bag? Throw it away! Shubhu! -Let him in. -Dad, open the door. First, get rid of the bag! A car is coming! -Let him in! -A car is coming! Open the door! Praise the Lord May he save us all Praise the Lord May he save us all Praise the Lord Oh, my God! What is this? Vaishali, don't touch the money! It's not ours! We can't keep it. What if someone finds out? -What if we get caught? -Dad! How will anyone find out? No one saw us. -We couldn't just leave it behind. -Shut up! Don't argue. Just drive. Just calm down. We're good. Dad, give me some change. We've got to get out of here quickly. Around Rs. 30 to 35. What are you doing, Dad? Hurry up! -I didn't do anything! -Dad! We don't want it. -The car... -I'll do something. -Hey, move it! -Start the car. Come on, move! Hello, mister! Brother, what about Beena? You're very keen, aren't you? No, I mean... He's head over heels in love with her! Mom, call Ketaki and tell her to keep the door open. Hello. Ketaki, open the door. Just open the door. Dad. Get in! Quick! Whose bag is this? Close the door. Bring it in. Yuck! What filth are you getting in the house? I am not going to clean this up! It's God's prasad. This much? Just close the door. Go on! -Where are you taking it? -Come on in. Dad! What's in it? Help me out. -Mom, why is it so heavy? -Keep your voice down. Hey, stop. You forgot to shut that door. Shut up, you idiot! Sorry. Are these notes real? How much is it? Mom, one bundle has 100 notes, right? -Yes. -Right. -Okay, so that's... -Sharad! Sharad! -Ketaki! -Let's go. -Vaishali! -Grandpa! -Who's down there? -Let me take you in. What were you doing down there? Grandpa, have you peed? No, I am yet to. Oh, God. We'll have to count it again. 250 multiplied by 100... multiplied by 2,000... equals to 5,00,00,000. -How much is that? -Well... Ones, tens, hundreds... -thousands... -It's Rs. 5 crore, dumb-ass! Shubhu... return Uncle Pramod's car tomorrow... with a full tank. I HAVE TO TELL YOU... Five! Five! "Wishing for something more than you need..." Vaishali. Is my vest washed? No, I will wash it in the evening. Listen. Let's buy a new washing machine. An automatic one. I will do all the laundry at once. The clothes will dry quicker. Mom, can I get another cup of tea? What? Aren't you going to work? Work? Why should I? Now that-- Ketaki, give me your scooter keys. Why? I am going out. And where are you off to, my dear son? I've been wanting to buy a new camera. There's a sale going on. What is this? "Greed". G-R-E-E-D. Move aside. Everyone, in here! -What happened? -How do I know? What are you doing? Knocking some sense into you! This is who we are. Look closely! I've got it fixed a hundred times! But I won't buy a new one... until it is completely worn out. -But now you can! -Keep quiet, Vaishali. That's not the point. This is! These are our values! Do not forget it! Move! "These are our values." What the... fudge! Uncle Pramod! Sharad! Sharad! -Vaishali! -Who is it? -Sharad! -Where are you? -How are you, Uncle? -Is that you, Pramod? Sharad! Sharad! Where... -What happened, Pramod? -Read this. -What is it? -What happened? What is it? We lost our fund, Vaishali. What? How did this happen? All the offices are shut. INVESTORS FURIOUS OVER THE FUND SCAM All bank accounts have been dissolved. They don't have a single penny. And all the documents are missing. And Ramakant fled. Who's Ramakant? He used to manage the fund. I should have known. He did look like a sly fox! All our money's gone. We are ruined. In fact, I myself advised so many people to invest! Vaishali. Don't you worry. Yeah, yeah, we are ruined! We've lost everything! Vaishali, calm down. Do not worry, Vaishali! We won't stay quiet. Not at all! I will gather all the investors. We will fight for our money! I need to go start planning. Don't worry, okay? Just think about it. We could have been one of them! But we've been blessed. It's all God's plan. Otherwise why would we find the bag in the middle of nowhere? The Lord favours the honest. All right. Let's do this. She's right. The Lord favours the... I didn't do anything! Vaishali... Hold on. What are you doing? I'm going to dump it back! -Shubhu! -Dad, no! It doesn't belong to us, Vaishali! -And who knows that? -I do. -You do. -And so do I! You know nothing. -What do I not know? -I don't know. All the investors lost their money. So did we! -It's the same money-- -Dad! What if they find out? What will they find out? Nobody's going to find out anything! I'm finding it hard to follow! -Step aside! -Dad! Dad, stop! -Shubham, get out of my way. -I won't. -I said move! -No! I said... move! -Have you lost it? Get up! -I won't! -Get up! -I won't get up. I saw the bag first! -So did I! -I won't get up! Shubham, I am warning you! -You... -What are you doing? -Quiet. -But... Vaishali... Go hide it! Go on, I'll do it. I'll do it! Look at him. Didn't I tell you? We'll catch him at his home. Sharad. We need an honest and trustworthy leader to help us get our money back. Hence, we have formed a committee and chosen you... as the head. Seriously? Yes. Sharad, you are not just a friend... you're an inspiration. You have always supported me. What happened? -Wait. -What happened? Sharad. Why do you seem so lost? Pramod. Heading the committee... -I can't do it. -Yes, you definitely can. Come on, let's go. We'll see you at the meeting. They respect you a lot. Sharad, listen to me. All Mehendale has is money. But you... Sharad, you... What's that word? What? Let it be. Whatever it is, don't lose it. Sharad... we will fight and win this battle. You are my best friend, Pramod. I'll get going. The world turns upside down With cash in your pockets The world turns upside... There you are... head of the committee! Sharad Atmaram Gupchup. Head of the committee. At first, I refused. But why? I've always dreamt of this day. When your photo dons every billboard across the town. And that thief Mehendale doesn't even get a mention. Investors have lost a huge amount. Whoever has pocketed that money, I pray he rots in hell, after dying a slow, painful death! I'll cook something sweet today. The world has turned upside down KATHOPANISHAD "I am full of grief. All my money..." Move. Let me try. Hold this. Shubhu. Shubhu. Turn the scooter towards the north. It's lucky for vehicles This is north, Mom! Why don't you ask Dad to buy me a new scooter, Mom? I don't have the money! "We dreamt of a bright future. But what did we get in return? Disloyalty..." Betrayal. "Betrayal. Somebody kicked us to the curb and..." It's fixed. I don't have the money. Listen up, fellas Money is the ultimate truth What only matters is money Not even daddy or mummy It is not funny For the rich, it's always sunny Money is yummy, yummy, yummy The one who dances to its tunes Is blessed with boons How will you follow the path of truth? Salute to the ones following The right path But we choose to run The wrong path Salute to the ones following The right path But we choose to run The wrong path Aspirations are costly But so is having morals Everyone's running a business The one who cons Is living it up No matter how honest you are The world will call you a fool The system runs everything Democracy is what follows It's an addiction You can't get over Dad's rules Are so old-school Ladies and gentlemen... -Vaishali. -Mom... My fellow sufferers... all of us invested in this fund... so that we get to lead a good life. But what did we get in return? Tell me. Betrayal! No! We can't steal in our own house. How is it stealing if it's our money? Yeah... No. And we aren't splurging. Exactly! It's for our needs. But... -No. -Mom, her scooter is dead! Someday she'll lose her leg kick-starting it. And he's not getting any work because he doesn't have a good camera. Forget about that. You should buy a washing machine first. Right! Look at your hands. That junk of a machine has robbed the beauty of your hands. Right, Ketaki? -Let's ask your... -No, no, no. You know Dad won't agree. But once we buy everything, he won't be able to do anything. Mom. What if God also wants this? I am scared. You know why? Because all of you are scared. This is about our money! Your fears are mine as well. We are all in this together! We won't spare them! Mom, look! The late Ramakant Ghuge... What? I mean we were late in finding out Ramakant's truth. He took advantage of our innocence. And then... He fled. He ran away with our money. He vanished. But we will find him! We will find that thief... no matter where he is! That's enough. Mom, if I take three drops instead of two from this wide, wide ocean, who's is going to know? The police and the government... We will pressurize them. We will hold strikes and protests! We will get Ramakant Ghuge's property auctioned... to get our money... We will take our money back! -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! Inspector Wasim Tamboli. I am... Sharad Gupchup. Head of this committee. Mr. Gupchup. I need to talk to you in private. Tell me. What's the matter, sir? We found this from the CCTV footage of Mr. Ghuge's house. He had this bag. We think that this bag had the cash. That's possible. That's absolutely possible, sir. Sir, please catch him and get us our money back. -Yes. -That's not possible. Last night, we found his body. -What about our money? -It wasn't there. How is that even possible? Exactly. The same day, we found another body. But that day... When did you find this body? Last night. But he didn't have the bag. So, what now? I guess they worked together. And killed each other for the money. Or perhaps someone else was involved. He might have that bag. Whoever that person is... I will not spare him. I had also invested money in that fund. What did we get? Betrayal! Sharad, it's viral. Did you go to the doctor? Sharad... Your speech has gone viral on YouTube! -You mean it's become popular. -Yes! You have become a star. Look at this. You've got millions of views! Read the comments. One says, "The city..." No! "The country needs a leader like Sharad Gupchup." Lovely! Sharad, I must say you are really good at giving speeches. Just like the prime minister! On the other hand, Mehendale... doesn't even give his own speech. No one applauds for him. But for you... no one can stop applauding for you! It came from my heart. But you won't make it big. -Why? -Because you don't have money. Actually... -I wanted to tell you-- -You don't have to. I know everything! You don't have to tell me anything! But... Listen... Pramod, listen to me. What if... we had the money? If we had the money, you would've had a great political career. I already have a plan. We will have four events in four months. The first event... will be a blood donation camp. The second will be a medical camp. Let's do something for women. -How about a devotional event? -Fine. For all the women. We will put up big billboards with your picture on it. Just wait and watch. You will be elected... in the next municipal elections. And I guarantee you'll have a landslide victory. You will be a civil servant. Better still, a corporator. And I will be your PA. You're daydreaming. Two cups, please. That's all we can do. Because we don't have money. Please sit. Tell me something. How much will it cost to organize such events? Sharad... we'll need a minimum of Rs. 3 crore. There will be loads to do. Pramod, don't stop the work. Continue with it. What? I will arrange for the money. What? What happened? What is it, Sharad? Pramod, from the past few days... I have been hearing the sound of a squirrel. No matter what the time is. I hear it but can't see it anywhere. A squirrel? Sharad. A squirrel's sound... is considered a good omen. Yeah! You have Lord Rama's blessings with you. Legend says the marks on a squirrel's back are Lord Rama's fingerprints. The squirrels helped him build the bridge to Lanka. It's a sign... that we'll successfully build the bridge to our political careers. You can't be a politician without Ram on your side. Mr. Gupchup! -What a brilliant speech! -Yes, I liked it. It was really good. The washing machine has so many buttons. Looks scary. Mom, it's easy. I'll show you. -Don't worry. -Okay. What's going on? That's a new scooter. A new washing machine. -You didn't buy anything? -I did, Dad. I bought the latest 5D camera. Wow. Anything else? Yes. -Mom. -Give it to him. This is for you. Your shoes were torn, right? You blockhead! All of you have gone crazy! Don't you have any brains? Houses are getting raided because of demonetization. We also lost our money, remember? We owe so many people for my surgery. So what? We'll return it all! We will, Vaishali, but won't they wonder where we got all the money from? And once they find out, I'll get beat up with this shoe! And then I will be jailed! You can then use your camera to click my mugshots. -But, Dad... -Please keep quiet! We haven't spent much. Nobody will notice the camera. And the washing machine will be in the bathroom. You're right. But what about the scooter? Will you keep that in the closet? Give me the keys. Mom has them. Give me the keys. Hurry up, will you? And return these damn shoes! Bunch of idiots! I didn't have a better solution to get rid of this problem. Put that down. Dad... How could you do this without telling me? Excuse me? I am your father. This is my house. I will do whatever I want. Dad, you could have kept some. -Why did you burn it all? -Keep quiet. How could you? God will punish you! Exactly. Fine by me. I don't mind bearing the punishment. The ones... The ones who don't respect money, suffer all their life. And so does their family! She is talking about you. At this rate, I'm sure you'll end up begging for money. I should have run away with the bag. I would've started a new life. You would've started a new life in jail. Sharad. Dad. What happened, Dad? It's your friend. What happened? Mehendale's house got raided. He is not my friend. Sir, is it true? This is just an inquiry. Did you see that? Yes. God's punishing him. Keep quiet, Vaishali. Our house could've been raided, too. He lost everything because of his greed. Desires can be dangerous. One should always be cautious about the path he chooses to fulfil his desires. If you end up choosing the wrong path, there is... no way back! Did you hear him? No way back. Paresh! Paresh. How did this happen? Tell me, Paresh. -I fell, that's all. -You're lying. Please tell me, how this happened. Fine, don't tell me. And don't even call me. Ketaki, listen to me! Tell me. The money... that I lent for your father's surgery... Yes? I had taken it from my boss. I couldn't return it on time, so he got me beaten up. Why didn't you tell me before? How could I? You were already so stressed. -I didn't want to trouble you. -Paresh! Everything will be fine. It's all a game of taking measured steps while making thalipeeth. -Yes, I get it. -And... you need to maintain the perfect balance while you put it on the pan. Be careful... Balance it, my boy. Let it roast. -Now flip it. -Like this? Add some ghee. Teaching him about balance is pointless, Dad. Add some ghee and... Shubhu... -Shubham, add some ghee. -Okay. Dad, we're out of bananas, right? I will go buy some. Pay attention, Shubham! Or you will ruin everything. Shubham! What is it? I got thalipeeth for you. I don't want it. What are you looking at? Get back to work. -Happy birthday. -Thank you. You didn't have to. That's it. Hey, what happened? Where are all your gold rings? Is everything all right? Everything's fine. You know you can't hide anything from me. Tell me the truth. You know I used to deal in cash, right? I incurred some losses. And even I can't help you. I need a big amount to bail out. It's beyond you. I... Cleanliness drive. But... Over here? My friends live in this area. It's a vote bank. What do you think about the flyer? It has a picture of you with a broom! Look. Come here. Sir will be seated over there. Tell me something. -Will Shubham photograph the event? -No. Let's hire someone else. I don't want to promote nepotism. Principles... go beyond family. -Open your bag. -What? -Open your bag. -Why? What is it? How did you... Who's your sponsor? Ravi. You don't let him enter your house, and he lent you money? I forgave him. Why? He understands our motives. He also wants to be a part of this drive against corruption. This way, even he'll wash away his sins. -That's great, Sharad. -Yes. -He turned out to be a good man. -Exactly. Tell him... that we have used his money to start the project. And that he should keep supporting us in this journey. This is just the beginning. Get in the car. The sun rises, shines bright With its light all over the flowers With its light all over the flowers But there came a bee on a bud -Oh, God! -The bee stung me! -What do I do? -The bee stung me! There is no cure! The bee stung me! -My, oh, my! -The bee stung me! The bee stung me! The bee stung me! The bee stung me! What happened to you, buddy? The bee stung me And its poison spread through my veins But I love how it feels Yes, the bee stung me! -Oh, God! -The bee stung me! -I want no cure -The bee stung me! Thank God The bee stung me! Hello, Mr. Gupchup. What are you hiding? If you get scared on seeing the police, you are either... a novice thief or highly noble. That was a good one. I have heard that you're an honest man. -Won't you invite me in? -No. Should I go? No! Please come in. Wait here. That's my father. He is not well. -Could be the weather. -True. And him? He is my son, Shubham. He is Inspector Wasim Tamboli. Shubham. These are the bad times. I couldn't find any evidence about the fund scam. You have seen the bag, right? -I have? -Yes. When did I see it? -Remember that picture? -Oh, yes. You showed it to me. Well, there was a bag. And there must be cash in it. If it had old notes, they would've burned it. And if it had new notes, they must've hidden it. That reminds me, I need to search your house. Shinde! Why? What do I say? Mehendale's house was recently raided. So we got orders to search the houses of all the other party members. And that is why we've been going around, searching houses. -What will you find here? -Salunke. Please check here. Don't create a mess. I know we'll not even find a dime in your house. You've lost everything in the fund scam. Right? Even I'm going through a bad phase. But duty is duty. Mr. Gupchup, how about a cup of tea? Salunke. Sir, jackpot! I found this in the room. Show me. Oh, wow! Lovely. These belong to my dad. He likes collecting coins. Wow, coin collection. Sir, you are a man of taste. Even I have a coin. It's old. Look. It has "786" written on it. It's my lucky number. As long as I have this coin, everything will be fine. I'll get going. See you soon. Good day. How much time do you have? Seven days. How will you arrange for the money? -Paresh. -Don't worry. Listen. Why don't you ask your father? Really? I see his posters everywhere. He's either found a treasure or won the lottery. Come on, tell me. His political party must have sponsored him. What? These parties always take money. They never shell it out. LET'S TAKE A STEP TOWARDS A CLEAN INDIA SPEARHEADED BY - MR. SHARAD ATMARAM GUPCHUP Listen, you two. Your father's word is unquestionable. If he said he has burnt the money, then he has done it! -What about all the hoardings? -The party must've paid for it. Mom, a party never sponsors anything! One has to invest his own money! They must've done it for your dad. Mom, he is right. Something's fishy. Had Dad been so honest he wouldn't have got the money home. He was the one who got it. You don't believe us? Fine! But he is a liar. How dare you! Your father will never lie to me. "He will never lie to me." Ketaki, I know Dad is lying. He has hidden the money. Mom's lying as well. -What? -I am sure. Mom is lying too. Mom isn't lying. She's just too simple. There is no Mrs. Palkar. What do you mean? Mom told me that she is Aunt Varsha's friend. Once I asked Aunt Varsha about her and she told me she has no such friend. Why didn't you tell me before? What is going on? What if our parents are fooling us? I am sure something is wrong. Try to find out. I need to find out. Wonderful! So much for being an "honest" man! Vaishali... this is for our betterment. Or else, we also would've been jailed. Your beloved son... and your great daughter... were misusing the money. What about me? Did I ever do it? I never said that. Then why didn't you tell me? I was going to. Fine. I need money. Give me a crore. What? Have you lost it? -Yes. -I won't give it to you. You won't? Fine, I'll go tell Ketaki and Shubham. What will you tell them? The truth. Hold on. Give me the money. This is all I have right now. I've hidden it in different places. Here. Where are you going? You burned the money, right? I need to work overtime. Where are you going? To meet Mrs. Palkar. -Now? -I will be back soon. Hey! Where are you going? For a stroll. Who will take out the trash? You are the social worker, right? -Hurry up -Where to? -Follow that rickshaw. -Where do you want to go? I asked you to follow the rickshaw. -Get down. -Why? What if that rickshaw goes across town? -I'll pay you an extra 20 bucks. -Get lost. I'll pay double the amount. Do you even have money? He doesn't think twice He goes for the chase Try not to get caught Leave no trace What's the matter, buddy? Don't ask stupid questions. Just drive. -What? -I mean, I'll tell you. Better. That woman is cheating on her husband. What a bitch! Such a shameless woman! Dad. Today is the day. "The one whose words differ from his deeds. Starts with an 'H' ends with an 'E.'" I don't know, Dad. "Hypocrite!" H-Y... P-O... C-R-I-T-E. One Two Three Four Five Six Seven, eight Nine, ten! Money rules the world There is nothing like it But watch out Money's tricky business You will willingly fall in its trap Money rules the world There is nothing like it But watch out Money's tricky business You will willingly fall in its trap Where did you get the money? What do you care? Just keep it. Thank you. Thank you so much. What's wrong? Tell me! I need more money. It's urgent. Is it? Don't worry. I'll do something. What are you saying? I am at work. What happened? You will get the money. How? I know someone who will sponsor us. And who is this person? Stop asking me silly questions! Take the money and throw it at your boss. Prem. Thank you. Get another for them. We'll get the money and the permission to marry. How? I am tired of dancing at other people's weddings. Trust me, we'll live like royalty. Really? Money rules the world There is nothing like it But watch out Money's tricky business You will willingly fall in its trap Bloody bastard! She is with him? Buddy, you are a great detective! -Will you spy on my wife, too? -Shut up! I was going to tell you everything. -Hands off! -I won't. I said hands off! Why did you lie to me? This James Bond turned out to be a wimp. Step out of your houses! Take a step against the corrupt! -Step out of your houses! -Take a step against the corrupt! -Step out of your houses! -Take a step against the corrupt! Mrs. Gupchup, welcome to the cleanliness drive! Applause! -We fought against the Britishers. -We'll fight against the corrupt. Listen... I want some money right now. Ravi needs it. -Forget about it -Sure, I will. But only after I tell Ketaki and Shubham that you're hiding the money. -I was hiding it! -What do you mean? I checked it this morning. The money's gone. -How? -Shubham stole it. -What? -I know it's him. I will get hold of him -and tell him to give it back. -Have you lost it? It's not that easy. He won't give it back so easily. I think we should wait. We will catch him when he tries to spend it. For now, hold this. -I need to end this! -Vaishali. Let's welcome Mr. Patil to the cleanliness drive. Shubhu! Give me the money. -What money? -Really? -How could you steal? -What? In fact, you stole the money! You gave the money to your brother's failing business, right? I saw everything! I know everything! Should I go tell Dad? Sure, go ahead. I'm not scared of him. -I took the money from him. -But he had burnt it all, hadn't he? I knew he was lying! -And you helped him? -I didn't! He did it all on his own! How did you know he didn't burn the money? Because I caught him red-handed last night, and now you're busted as well! Give me the money! How can you say that I stole it? Your father told me! Nonsense! He is fooling us all. Don't you get it? Just like he didn't burn the money... nobody stole it as well. Got it? -It's a responsibility we bore... -A cleaner India we strive for! -It's a responsibility we bore... -A cleaner India we strive for! -It's a responsibility we bore... -A cleaner India we strive for! -Neither the police, not the court... -Sharad Gupchup is whom we support! -Neither the police, not the court... -Sharad Gupchup is whom we support! Neither the police, not the court... -It's a responsibility we bore... -A cleaner India we strive for! -It's a responsibility we bore... -A cleaner India we strive for! -Neither the police, not the court... -Sharad Gupchup is whom we support! -Neither the police, not the court... -Sharad Gupchup is whom we support! -Neither the police, not the court... -Sharad Gupchup is whom we support! -Neither the police, not the court... -Sharad Gupchup is whom we support! -Neither the police, not the court... -Sharad Gupchup is whom we support! Ladies and gentlemen. Greetings. I would like to thank Mr. Sharad Gupchup for such a well-organized cleanliness drive. He has always inspired us -with his loyalty and humble nature. -We saved some. We saved some? Great! Dishonesty and corruption has ruined our country. Look at the number. ...and our party will continue to fight against it. I know him. Do me a favour. Give this to him. It will make him happy. Trust me. We should have the law on our side. Give it to him. His dedication towards... solving the problems faced by the citizens is worth appreciating. Our country is undergoing a change. And to lead our country towards a bright future we need leaders like Mr. Sharad Gupchup. -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! -Go ahead! Take the step! -We are with you! Go ahead! Take the step! Shubhu, don't do this! -Shubhu! -Let go, Mom! You shouldn't mess with money. The fact is that you all were messing with me! You burn the money. You hide the money. Your dad lied! Why are you blaming us? Stop it, Mom! -Shubham! -You thought I stole the money! He is taking away all the money. Because I found the bag! It's my money and I am taking it! But we risked our lives keeping it at home, didn't we? Really? Risk? Well, you aren't at risk anymore! You will have some peace now! Shubham, listen to me. She wanted a scooter, she got it. You wanted a camera, you got it. And we'll keep things that way. We will keep the money and decide if we should ever give it to Dad. But I've decided that I won't give it to anybody! Shubhu! -Shubham! -Shut up! What will you do? If you try to act smart, I will expose you! What are you talking about? Shubhu! -Move! -Shubhu! -Come in, Mr. Leader! -What's happening? Why are you creating a ruckus? I was just about to leave. If you're done with the drama, I'll get going. -What's going on? -You don't know? It's all because of you. He is going away with the money. Shubham, keep the bag down. Or else, I'll call the police. Sure. I will tell them everything! Why are you threatening him? Why don't you ever talk to him properly? Shubham, son, listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. Look we... We are family. And family helps each other. You have to think about everybody. Oh! You and your speech. Shubhu, listen. Look at your mother. You are our only son. Forget about everything that happened. We are with you. We'll do everything as you say. -Okay? -And what about the fact that I've been slogging for years to earn for the family? Even though you are elder to me, I never complained about working. When you were busy "working" with Paresh, I've been handling the trash of this family. -Are you talking about that scoundrel? -We love each other, Dad. And we are going to get married. Mom, did you hear that? That man is a bastard! He'll knock you up and leave you! -What will you do then? -Shubhu... You're the reason we met. He is his friend. If he is a bastard, why is he your friend? He lent money for Dad's surgery. -He is in danger. -Let him be. I have no family or friends! -Seriously? -I am going. Dad, move. -Wait a minute! -Dad, move! Hold on! Did you know about this? You want to leave, right? Go on. Leave right now! But before you go just wait for a minute. -What? Put out the trash? -Just shut up for a minute! Look how he's speaking. -Dad... -Don't... Wait a minute! For the last 30 years I've been... working selflessly for the party. But today, I felt that I can become a leader. But nothing is possible... without money. I lived as a party worker, and I'll die a party worker. Okay? Shubham, do me a favour. -Please kill me before you go. -No! Have you lost your mind? He's gone crazy! First, you made me a thief and now a murderer? -Kill me. -Why don't you commit suicide? -Kill me! -Throw away the knife! -Kill me! -Dad! Stop the bloody drama! Stop it! Let's be practical! Let's just divide the money equally! So you can spend it on your lover, she can give it to her brother, and he can become a great leader, right? -No! No! I won't let it happen. -Shubham! -I'll not divide the money! -Mom... I am leaving. Do whatever you want! Mom, stop him! -Stop him! -Dad! Give me the bag! -Give me the bag. -Let go of me! Let go of the bag! Hey! What are you doing? Dad, go to your room! Sharad... Shubhu... Shubham! Sharad! Sharad! Sharad! Sharad... Sharad... Sharad... Sharad! Sharad! Grandpa! Grandpa! He's bleeding... Dad! What are you doing? Calling the doctor, Dad. And what will you tell him? The doctor will be followed by the police. We will... We will bribe them and hide all this, Dad. How many of them will you bribe? And what if they refuse? What if some idiot turns out to be honest? Just like him. Dad... We just have one way out. We'll say he died in his sleep. Yeah. He wasn't keeping well. And the doctor knows that. Shubham. He was a pure soul. He died in his sleep.
