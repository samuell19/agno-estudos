Whoa, lads, whoa, boy. Come on with those heevies Make it snappy. Jim? You certainly get more work out of these jacks than any foreman I've known. I'll be mighty glad when your holiday is over. Me, too. There's no place like Canada. Though that kid sister of mine doesn't seem to think we're up to date. Imagine anyone preferring London to this? I bet she's going to be mighty glad to see you. Sure she will. And what a surprise. - Oh, just walking right in on her, huh? - Yeah, she doesn't know I'm coming. It's just about time somebody checked up on her. All alone over there. Mighty fair city, London. Say listen, Jim, you mustn't be too strict with her. A little innocent fun isn't going to hurt anybody. If I found anyone fooling around with that kid, it'd be just asking for trouble. One, two one, two, three Aren't they doing well, the little darlings? I must say you're a love. Slogging your feet off, day-after-day. - What do you get it for it? Nothing. - One of them brought me a pork pie today. We can't pay the rent with pork pies, what we need is money. If their mothers want their little darlings to be hoofers, they've got to pay. I know. Make a speech. You know, appeal to them. Wring their hearts. - I'll try, Patsy. - Yes, yes, go on, go on. Atta girl. My friends, my good little friends, look, when you go home today, - will you ask your - If it's about money, then nothing doing. - Will any of you pay? - No! Oh, darlings! Well, let's start at the beginning again. Diana's a chump, standing up there on that roof till she's ready to drop. Not a ha' penny does she get out of it. She thinks more of the kids than she does of herself. Say, will you stop scribbling in that precious book of yours while I insult my best friend. If you mean comrade Diana, I don't agree. She spurns money rightly. In the coming civilization, money as we know it will cease to exist. - Baloney. - Miss Baloney Say, turn your head to the left, will you? - Huh? Miss Baloney... - Turn higher. Miss Baloney will be a Bible for the next generation. Max, if we don't get some food and the pay the rent, there won't be any next generation as far as Diana and I are concerned. Why don't you get out of that chair and do some real work. I'll get up out of this chair when the time comes and then you'll see a man of action. A man of terror. The iron commissar. Max Max Oliver. Damn it, Max, the revolution may not come for days. After all, Diana and I did give you a roof over your head, now it's up to you to look after us. You're supposed to be a man. We don't recognize sex in the party. Must be a dull party. Oh, do I really look like that? What makes you think you've been posing for the face? - Bye, John, bye, John. Look what I've got. - Still no money. - Food, if I remember rightly. - How about that brother of yours in Canada isn't he good for a touch? Sure, he'd send money. For my return ticket to Canada. He wouldn't even listen to reason. If he thought I was a flop, it would be back to the old log cabin for me. Sounds like a popular song. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Oh oh, oh, Mr. Hamilton. Do come in. I suppose you've come for this week's rent? No, last week's rent. And the six weeks before that. Yeah, and it's no good telling my missus she'll get her money when you finish that - because she wants it now. - But my pupils, I'm going to make so much money out of my pupils, - if you'll only give us... - Look here, comrade Hamilton, I thought we'd discussed this matter of rent once and for all. Haven't I told you that rent is immoral? Why I even read you Chapter Four of my book to prove it. And you're right, comrade, but my missus can't see it. "Pay up or get out," she said, the old c... Week after week, you attend my meetings in Hyde Park, and now this. Didn't I promise to send your wife to a concentration camp? And I'm depending on it, comrade. You're not really going to sling us out into the streets? Well, it's not my doing. I've argued with my wife, but it's her house and what she says goes. I'm sorry, comrade. Well, that's that. Well I'm not going to take this lying down. - Somebody's got to get some work. - Hm-mm. - Somebody's got to work. - Mm. Oh, don't look at me. I don't believe in commerce. I'd sooner commit a crime. Yeah, but what about my beautiful horse. I put everything I've got into him, including your face. Max, you're not really going to let us down. Think of us on the streets. Cold, hungry. Then the realization that you're responsible. You'd never forgive yourself. Outside is London with all its wealth. - All we need is a little of it. - But what can I do? The mastermind of the new day asks us what to do! Can this be Max, the great thinker, the great leader? He'll be careful crossing streets, won't you, Maxie, darling? All right. But remember, you drove me to it. - I'll go out into the night. - But it's broad daylight, honey. Mere figure of speech for a desperate man. Now I've forgotten what I was going to say. But anyway, on your own heads be it. Huh! - Well, we finally did it. - But we had to chain him into it. - Patsy? - Mmm? - I wonder what he meant by - By what? Well, that it will be on our heads. Patsy, you don't think that He did say that, that he'd sooner commit a crime than work Oh, but he wouldn't hurt a fly. Oh, I don't know about that. When he gets an idea on that one-track brain of his, anything can happen. I'd better stop him. Ah! Aaah! Are you hurt? Oughtn't we to roll her on her barrel or something? - Oh, isn't that for drunks? - Oh, can you speak? You idiot! You petrol-soaked idiot! Who gave you a car to play with? I I'm not the idiot, really. He is. Oh! So it was you. Don't look at me with that silly grin. You might have killed me. Hmm. I'm sorry, what did you say? I said I hope I didn't hurt your car. Oh, if you did, it's not mine anyhow, it's only Reggie's. Yeah, but don't be silly, you were driving. Well, trying to wriggle out on a technicality, eh? Will you two make up your minds which of you were trying to kill me? It's too bad. To think that nasty car of yours might've smashed your lovely face. - Are you sure no bones are broken? - Thank you, I can feel for myself. Er, let me see you home safely. I'll feel safe when you and that battering ram are out of sight. - Ooh, er, how about a nice cup of tea? - I've had tea. Yeah, if you're thinking of suing me, I know a very good lawyer. - Just hop in, I'll drive you there. - Will you go away! Yeah, er, the trouble is, you know, I haven't been in England for a long time, I can't get used to keeping to the left side. What makes you think you didn't? Reggie, never, never do a thing like that again. No. This is fine, isn't it? Trying to smash up my car. Aren't you satisfied with hanging your own dangerously on a telegraph pole yesterday? Listen, if you're going to drive in this position, I'm going. Ah, it's all right, Reggie, you're safe with me. Oh! - Good job I didn't tear my best trousers. - You're lucky to be wearing trousers, Buzz and I slipped off a bus I wasn't. Can you imagine, he wanted me to have tea with him and then sue him. Lovely, wasn't she? Oh, those eyes. You know, you must see eye-to-eye with me about her eyes, Reggie. Yeah, I know who won't see eye-to-eye with you. - Constance. - Nonsense. It's not nonsense. Here it is, in black and white. Don't show me that again, it's not true, anyway. Course it's true. This is the Conservative paper. There you are. "An engagement is announced between Lady Constance Westaker and Mr. Nicholas Brook, the wealthy sportsman who recently arrived in England. It is understood the wedding will take place in four weeks. " Four weeks! I'm not engaged to Constance. That paper's a lying rag. This paper is never wrong. It knew about both my engagements being broken off before I got the rings back. It's fantastic. Just because I've danced with Constance half a dozen times. And it's not fair to her, either. - No, of course not - She's probably even more furious than I am Oh, she'll be absolutely livid, - I should think. - Hm. Yes, I have the paper before me now. Thanks so much for printing it word-for-word. You always were a darling. I'll have some more news for you soon. The exact date, I hope. Thanks again. Bye. That ought to get him. Our bills can wait another four weeks, I expect. Well, I hope the fella has a decent background, otherwise borrowing money off him will be like running a tradesman bill. Give me a chance at him. Just a little check to be No Don't you try cashing any of those weird checks of yours. Leave him to mother and me and we'll all be on Easy Street. Mr. Brook and Mr. Baird, m'lady. Oh! Watch your step and think of your overdraft. Nicky, darling, - what an absolutely ingenuous - Hello, Constance. Way to propose! You've seen the paper, of course? - That's why I'm here, because - Just like a romantic legend. You are a darling. You know mother, of course. Oh, how do you do, Lady Emily, this is really rather embarrassing. I think it's lovely. Constance was in shock at first, but a mother must realize she can't keep her children forever. How are you, my boy. I'm Uncle Gerry. - How do you do, sir? - You one of the (Varksa) Brooks? Oh, you mustn't look for blue blood in my family, sir, no. Decidedly lower middle class. - All father's money was made in - Say no more, my boy, say no more. Oh, how stupid of me, I forgot to cash that check. Freddie, run along to the club. Course I could tell that Constance was in love. You can't keep a thing like that from a mother, can you? The poor child hasn't been eating properly for weeks. None of us have Connie, I must speak to you a moment alone, if you'll excuse me What's the matter with you, Nicky? You're supposed to be happy. Being engaged to me isn't so terrible as all that, is it? Oh, well no, Constance, of course not. Er... - What? - Well - You're not in love with me and... - But I am, Nicky. Now you two, there's plenty of time for love making later on. - You mustn't monopolize each other. - Er, Lady Emily, there's something I ought to say and Look, can you come back later when they've gone? - Right. Well, that's a date. - Oh - Well goodbye, Lady Emily. - Oh, you've only just come. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Connie. - Kiss me - Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Oh, it's you. Er, you all know Reggie Baird, don't you? - I'm afraid not. - How do you do? - Goodbye. - How do you do. Connie, my dear congratulations. Mmm Come along, Reggie, we're late. It's been charming. - Well, how's it gone? - Yes, what did you say? He's not landed yet. But, he will be. Well, a fine help you've been. Congratulations. Well, I don't know what you're going to do, I'm going shopping. Do you think a fish slice would make a good wedding present? There'll be no wedding. I couldn't make a scene in front of the whole family, but later on I'll go back and straighten it all out. Yeah, you hope. You'd better be careful, they're a very old family. If they can get a title out of Henry the Eighth they can get a wedding out of you. I'll drive Thunderbolt, if you don't mind? Quite enough of your kind of help for one day, thank you. Idle rich. Oglethorpes Advertising Agency. No, I'm sorry, Mr. Gibson's busy. - Are you the girl for the lipstick poster? - Yes. - The photographer's waiting for you. - Thank you. Er, any message I can take. Thank you. Receipt, please. Get me Mr. Gibson, quickly please. Wait, it's a lie. Besides, I've got an alibi, hmm I asked for ten models and I get seven. I've got a dozen posters to get out! I can't work without models. What's the good of my brain if I haven't got bodies to work on. Come on, come on, spread out, I want a group, not a traffic jam. - For you Mr. Gibson. - Hm? Telephone, just when I'm giving birth! Yes, yes, yes? For the Vitasan poster? What's he look like? Is he disgusting? Does he make you feel sick? Yeah! Hold him there! Now don't let him get away. This is an outrage. I am an innocent man. Here he is, Mr. Gibson. Fell right into our nest. You haven't got anything, on me. - I want you. - I can explain everything. - You don't have to with that face. - Mmm? Ever been a model? - Model? - Yeah. Hmm, as a matter of fact, I have. Good! Oh, what a face! What a figure! What a man! - On! - Come with me. Come on, come on! Ooh, oh Cor Stop crying, it's for your own good. No, no, no. Oh! - What a place. - You said it, gorgeous. But you should have seen this dump when I took it over six months ago. Now it's like my New York shop. England's national gallery of advertising. For the Vitasan advert. Before taking. Isn't he magnificently revolting? - Yes, Mr. Gibson. - Mmm, flabby. Weak. Miserable. Bald. I'm here to earn some of your hateful money, not be beaten to a pulp. Behave, behave. Could you use another model? Don't tell me there are two like you?! Well no, not exactly. She's a girl. A very pretty girl. Yeah, yeah, send her around. I'll look her over. I'll go and fetch her. No, no, no, no, no, telephone, telephone, telephone. You don't get out of here. Things like you only happen once in a life time. - What's the matter? - Poor Max. I hope he's all right. Hello? It's Max. If you're so insistent in making money, I know where you can get some, provided you don't care what happens to you. Come to 27 Craddock Street. I wish you could see me now. I'm a lost soul. Yes, Max, I've got the address. But Max, what sort of a place is it? - Ugh! Horrible! - Horrible? - Revolting! - Revolting? Don't blame me if you hate it. But remember, I'm suffering, too. But Max. Max! He's gone. Patsy, he's in awful trouble. We've got to help him! Hurry, it may be too late. Give me that address. Do be careful, Diana, you heard what he said. Remember now. Now, I'll be sitting here worrying about you. Brave girl. This is your place. Can't do it. I can't do it. - But I thought you said you were a model. - I am. For horses. - What? - Horses heads. Well, heads or tails, you're now working for Oglethorpes Advertising Agency. You're bought and paid for. - Ah! - Come on, get ready! Ooh! Head and chest in. Shame of it. This is all the fault of my landlord's wretched wife. Now my face will be on all the posters. Frightening people into chemist shops. Frightening them? Why, with your face we'll paralyze them. Now look depressed. - Ooh... - Give me misery. Hold it. Okay! Lenin, I have betrayed you. Oh Is it any use my waiting another four hours? I'm sorry. I'm sure it'll be quite all right as soon as Mr. Gibson's sees you. - Oh, Mr. Gibson! - Yes? - For the Comfy Wumfy Bed ad. - Wow! The Comfy Wumfy Bed ad. Oh, no, no,no, you're not the pajama type, is he? - No, Mr. Gibson. - No, I look better in pajamas myself. Oh yes, Mr. Gibson. Have we got a girl for the Broadway Silverware Ad? - Not yet, Mr. Gibson. - Oh, I must find one today. The perfect bride. Someone who'll crown their knives and forks with a halo of romance. - That's beautiful. - Somewhere in London there's a bride for me and I've got to find her. Yes, Mr. Gibson. Fancy saying I don't look good in pajamas. Everybody in London knows howl look in pajamas. Excuse me, but, what sort of place is this? - Frightful. Absolutely shocking. - Shocking? - Yes. Take my advice and don't go in. - Oh, but I've got to go in. Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Comfy Wumfy Beds, indeed. Comfy Wumfy Beds? You're up for the underwear poster, aren't you? - Yes. - I'll see if they're ready. Are you ready for Mr. Willis yet? - Excuse me - Er, just a moment, please. Yes. Excuse me, but, have you seen a man, a rather pale and desperate man? - Lots of men here. - They're ready for you. - Get undressed, pleased. - Thank you. Just what I've been looking for. Oh! Have you ever been a bride? - Me? Oh, no, no, no, no - Oh, you're swell. Well, that, that's awfully kind of you, but - I think you'll be just right, huh? - Ah - Oh no, I wouldn't, I'm sure. - Oh, it's a chance of a life time. - It'll lead to big things. Come on - Oh, please Oh Oh Oh... Here's the bride I've been looking for Dawson. Isn't she perfect, isn't she marvelous? Well, get her ready, haven't I waited long enough? Hmm, I hope you'll do the last three I had were no good. Let me go let me go Oh Aah! What are you so nervous about? I've handled dozens of brides. Oh, please let me go. You've had so many, you won't miss me. Oh, please. - Hmm just what I wanted. - If you touch me, I'll scream. Say, what's eating you? Oh, we might as well get this over with. Hey Bill, bring that camera over here. I thought I had a bride, but she's nuts. You mean you're not going to marry me? Say, listen kid, all I want is your photograph, understand? - No. - What? - I, I mean, yes, yes. - This is the greatest day of your life. But before you go to the altar to plight your troth you have to slip away for one last fond look at this beautiful silver service by Baldley's of Bond Street. So give me happiness. Give me that rosiest look that conjures up dreams of that first breakfast with the man of your heart. That sacred right consecrated by Baldley's of Bond Street. Okay, Bill. Swell. Now relax. Now when she comes to we'll tell her we can use her again tomorrow. Aaah! I saw the whole thing, miss. It was his fault. - Mmm. - I knew it! Eight million! Eight million! Oh, what do you mean, eight million? Eight million people in London and you have to pick on me! Oh no, no, really, I didn't pick on you. No, it was just good luck. I, I mean, er... - No first aid, thank you. - Oh, you sure you're not hurt? Quite sure. But better luck next time. Perhaps you really will be able to kill me then. Has he run you down before, miss? He has. He thinks I'm an arterial road. Oh, it's a bit thick, picking on one pedestrian. Like catching the same fish twice. Well, will it help matters any if I were to sling myself in the river or something. - It would. - Yes. - Oh, don't run away again. - I can't. Look what you've done. Oh dear, isn't it meant to be like that? Well never mind, I'll fix it. - Look at him. - Oh I'm afraid you've lost him, my dear. Playing around already and under your very eyes, too. If you can't hold him after that act the family put on today, you're beaten. - You give up too early, mother dear. - Well, I'm off. In a few moments my wealthy fianc? will be paying a call on me. And when he does, we shall all be in the soup, because I know he's going to break off that not-so-bright engagement of yours. - That's what he thinks. - Got an idea? - Hm-mm. - Are you a good actress Mother? No more than the average married woman. I've managed to fool your father for a number of years. Well, here's your chance to fool Nicky Brooke. - How? - When he comes here tonight - I wished you liked me. - I see no reason for it. I've had a hard day and now you have to turn up again. I think it's been my lucky day. Look, why don't you come out to dinner with me? What is there about my prostrate form would suggest food to you, huh? - Tea and now dinner. - Well, maybe you arouse my appetite, huh? Quite the gallant knight, aren't you? Quite the gallant knight. Well, if it's any consolation to you, I'm wearing your colors. Black and blue! Oh, after all, it's not entirely my fault this time. You were behind me, I haven't got eyes in the back of my head. I suppose you're going to say, "it's just like a woman, not watching where she's going". Well, come to think of it, yes. Clumsy fool, you might have killed me. - I saw the whole thing. it was his fault. - Thank you, miss. After all, you haven't got eyes in the back of your head. Just like a man, not watching where he's going! - I was sitting on the ground. - Why? Just a moment, sir. Ah, I thought it might be you. I'm so pleased to see you. - How are you? - Constance is I can't say one word in front of Collins, she's such a gossip. And she exaggerates, too. I can't even let her know that Constance is lying ill in there. She might spread it as the bubonic plague or something. Constance ill? Since when? Oh, it's nothing. Nothing, I assure you. She'll be better soon. Just nerves. She's so intense now. Well, I'm glad it's not serious. So, when I can see her. Not now. I've just given her a sedative. She's sleeping like a child. I'm sure she'll be better in a day or two, and then she'll be very glad to see you. A day or two! Well, there's something I wanted to get off my mind today. - Is there? - You see - Lady Emily, look, I came back - What must you think of me, my dear boy, I haven't offered you tea. Now, let's see I don't drink tea, I just want a word with you. Oh, not before Collins if you don't mind, if it's anything personal. She'll build your merest weakness into overwhelming vice. - I mean, it isn't a question of - Shh - Tea for two. - Oh, no tea for me, really. You men are always in such a hurry. Where to now? To the club with that rubber of bridge or whatever you play? L Play squash. Then for a rubber of squash. Well, if you must go, you must. Collins will get your things. Lady Emily that announcement in the papers, er, there was a mistake. - I know. I noticed it myself. - You did? I did. They spelt your name with a final 'e'. I do spell my name with a final 'e'. Do you? But you don't pronounce it. Not 'Brookie" I hope? No, not 'Brookie". Lady Emily, what I wanted to say was Shh Now you will come in tomorrow, won't you? No, make it the next day. And you will promise me that you won't be in such a hurry next time. Well, I'm not in a hurry now. Now, don't try to be polite just to please an old woman. I must go myself. Goodbye, dear boy. Good bye, Lady Emily. I need that. I thought he had me once or twice. - It'll be easier next time. - Got another idea? Hmm-mm. A nice little surprise for my future husband. It's brilliant. - Well, perhaps she's got measles. - Now why should she have measles? Well, a friend of mine had, broke out in spots on his wedding day. Picturesque, but dashed embarrassing. No, no, there's nothing the matter with her at all. Mother scarcely gave it a thought yesterday. She'll be all right tomorrow. I see. Floral offering today, grand farewell scene tomorrow. Your passion for dramatics remain unappealing. There will be no scene, no fireworks Constance is a very understanding girl. - Really? - Hey, look who's there. - Max - For Lady Constance Weslake. Now tell her I hope she gets better and I'll be seeing her soon. - Thanks. - Thank you. Hello. I was hoping I'd run into you, I mean, see you again. You! I might have known you'd be around. I suppose you put that there? What? No, really I didn't. What's the matter? Caught your heel? Ah, no. And it's no use you asking me to have breakfast because I've already had it! Well, that's more than I have. I didn't have any dinner last night, either. I've got spots in front of my eyes, I can't depend upon them at all. You're telling me. Do you mind doing something about this? Yeah, of course I will. You know, I'll have to go to an oculist. Take your face, for example. For all I know you might be downright plain or even ugly, but I think you're beautiful. Now that must be a question of my eyes. I mean, you I even think you've got a pretty nose. And for all I know it may be a funny sort of turned up little thing. Oh why pick on me. You must know someone else in London. - You don't still hate me, do you? - Oh, don't be ridiculous. - I don't even know you! - Well now, that's an absurd answer. I hardly know you and yet I'm probably - on the verge of falling in love with you. - Oh... It's happening even as we're standing here. It's not our doing, it's just a matter of chemistry. We're playthings of science. - Couple of test tubes - Will you go away! Well all right, goodbye. Oh, no! No. - Do something about this. - Please. Will you please do something about this? Now wait a minute. What on earth are you doing? Hey! Hey! Morning, Miss Castle. Room number five. Thank you. That girl who just came in. I want to see her. Well you can't see her, she's busy. Do you know her? Do I know her? I love her What's her name? Oh, you love her and you don't know her name? Now listen, my proud beauty, one of these fine days you hope to meet the man who will marry you, who will be the father of your children. - Do you know his name? - No. Well, there you are. You see, names mean nothing. Oh, come on, come on, tell me, what's her name? - Diana Castle. - Diana Castle. Tell Diana I want to see her. - You can't see her, she's posing. - Posing? Yes, for advertising. Simon's silk stockings. - Who's this? - Oh, well, I - Oh, he was, er - I - Er - I am just one of your models. - Pardon? - Yes, this young lady knows me well. She said something about the Simon's silk stocking - But Mr. Gibson - Shh - He'll do. Give your friend a pass. - Pass, please. - But I don't remember your face. - That's because of my beard. Ah, you've shaved it oft'? - No, I never grew it. - I see. Dressing room number six, Mr., um Smith. Winnie, how often have I told you to keep your desk nice and tidy? Yes, Mr. Gibson. Look, now then, you're in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot, the Wind's blowing everything out of sight. Ah, but there's no real wind when you're wearing Simon's silk stockings. Will you make that wind machine go faster! I've got a model I want you to work with, - I'll go fetch him. - You wait here. Is this starch any good? Remember, Oglethorpes handle only the best. You'll find this is perfect, sir. If you mind watching whilst I put on the fan, sir. And you'll find this will dry in a few seconds. It will dry as hard as a board. Now just watch, sir. Diana Diana Diana - Do any, any of you girls know - Ah, there you are. - Well, how does it look, eh? - Well, well, well, it's, er Gosh, you're so tall you've probably got snow on your head all the year round. - Huh? - Ah-ha, just the Victorian touch, I see. Trying to make England silk underwear conscious? Say, if you can't make 'em conscious of silk underwear, they're dead. Ah Isn't that Lady Constance with Westaker? - Yes, yes, it is, yes. - Pretty, isn't she? - Yes, but - She doesn't work here too, does she? Oh, no, not likely. Just turns up every now and then to endorse a perfume or two and gets plenty of dough for it. You know, if you want to be a lady, - smell like one. - Oh. Come on, Mr. Smith. This is the model I want you to work with. - How do you do? - Well, I'm frightfully well, but I always find Ascot so terribly exhausting. Hello, Diana. - Now it's starts all over again. - Hmm-mm. Bring that wind machine up a little, will you? Stand there, I'll show you what I want. - Well, er, something like this, or this? - Will you let me go! It's a swell idea. Grab her again. You two holding hands, her skirt blows up, it can't miss. See, he said you can't miss. Something like, er, this? Say, hold that, I want to have a look at it. More chemistry. Just a couple of old test tube. Now do you mind getting out of here and letting me earn a living? I've got to earn a living too, you know. Ow! - You're just a rich young man - Oh no, I'm a model. - Model? - Mmm. Turn a little to the left, Mr., er, um John Smith. - So that's your name? Mr. John Smith. - Uh-huh. Now wait a minute, we'll get the camera and shoot it straight away. Do you mind explaining your mad behavior? Well, I don't know. I feel terrible. - Maybe it's love. - I beg your pardon. I only said maybe. You know, you're icy. Perhaps it's that thing over there, if I go and turn it off, - perhaps things will warm up around here. - I prefer it cold. Oh, nonsense, I can't let you catch cold. Oh, let's be friends. Just because I drive a car rather casually, doesn't mean to say I bungle everything. Turn off that wind machine! Been any trouble. In future, nobody must touch this wind machine but me! - You all right? - I believe you're really worried about me. Oh, well, someone's got to worry about you. Do you realize you've lost your job? There's plenty more. With you by my side I ooze confidence. - Looks like your oozing pie. - Yeah - You didn't get the sack too, did you? - No fear. Sorry you did, though. - Anyhow, you don't want to be a model. - Eh? Strike out for bigger things. Stop driving around in borrowed cars and get down to some real work. Does this mean you're going to watch my future career with great interest? Oh well, there isn't anything you can't succeed in. - Unless it's driving a taxi. - Mmm-mm. - Then worry. - I'm not worrying. Come on. This calls for a celebration. Let's go out into the country, get some air, eh? - Don't mention the air to me. - Tell you what, - I'll borrow Reggie's car - Uh-uh. No, just this once. Oh well, if you're going to drive a car, - I'll be safer in it than out of it. - Come on. Sweet and low Sweet and low Wind of the western sea - Low... - on! Here don't hug your food. Oh, my frocks all crashed. Hm, "Society New". Your friend Reggie interested in this sort of thing? Oh yes, he's quite a lad for gadding about and dining out and The Marchioness of Wintergrove gave a small dinner last night for her debutante daughter. The guests were Small dinner, my eye, there's three hundred if there's one, must queue up like a breadline. Dinner for two is my idea. An engagement is announced between Lady Constance Westaker and Mr. Nicholas Brooke. The wealthy young sport - I'm sorry, give me that paper. - John! Well, I'm sorry, but all that society life sickens me. Well, there's no need to be so violent about it. Anyone would think this Nicholas Brooke was a long lost enemy of yours. Well, he is in a way. - Do you know him? - Mmm. Bet he's dropped you now he's marrying a title. No, he's not. All that's definitely off. Inside information. The engagement will be broken tomorrow. You watch the papers. I will not. He can marry the whole peerage for all I care. I know the type. Pots of money, no brains and a big snob. Lady whatever her name is can have him! Let's talk about John Smith. Sweet and low Oh, it's nice and - This is my idea of heaven. - Grand. All peace and quiet, with just you and me. Caviar! Oh John, you shouldn't. I'm glad you did, though, I haven't tasted caviar for years. Excuse me, but have you seen a tall, dark man around, sort of foreign looking? - Haven't seen a soul. - No, nobody. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry to have troubled you. That's all right. They haven't seen him. He must be somewhere around. Can't have got very far away. Try further up the road. I wonder if Reggie's wireless works. Oh, darling, don't tell me you've forgotten the tea? - Very nice wine. - I prefer tea. - Beautiful beer. - I want tea. Lovely, lovely lemon squash. I don't want lemon squash. I want tea. My cousin in New Zealand is drinking tea, my uncle in Ceylon is drinking tea, my brother in Canada is drinking tea and I want tea. You shall have tea. You see that beautiful farmhouse over there? I'll go straight over and get you vats of it, and what's more, I'll drink the beastly stuff. Behold! A criminal before you. Fled from justice with life. Have the honor to meet me. I am the greatest singer in all the world. In fact I am the greatest singer in Switzerland. In my country they call me the song bird of the Alps. I am on my way there now to sing a duet with the echo. Why do you not hail my greatness? Oh, but I do, I think you're wonderful. I think you're marvelous. Well, why do you not ask me to sing? I am not happy when I do not sing. Oh well, well, please don't be unhappy. Won't you sing something for me? I shall sing everything. - Oh well, that's fine. - Where are you going? Over here. You see, I'm sitting in the gallery. You see, it gives a greater effect, especially with a voice like yours. No gallery for you. You shall have the honor to sing with me. You shall be my echo. Oh no, no really, I couldn't, I'm not worthy to sing with you. Besides, I don't know very much about opera. Wouldn't it be better and a very good idea if I went home and studied and then came back again? I think you shall have the honor to sing with me. So sing, now! Farewell my gallant Captain - Farewell my gallant Captain - No. I told you how t'would be Ah!

Comrade, I don't recognize property rights. That sausage is mine. Dried toast for you. If you look healthy and well fed, you'll lose your job. My job! I'm a martyr to capitalism. Someday there'll be legends about me. King Alfred and the cakes. Bruce and the spider. Max Polover and the sausage! Breakfast. Hey, I wonder where those two are? Come on, Max, help me drag 'em down. Diana, you'll be late for work! Well, what on earth are you two doing? - Proposing. - And I said yes. Pro but, but you're crazy. You've only known him a couple of days! - I know, isn't it terrible. - Was that only two days? Seems as though we've known each other since childhood. - Ah, it's all so hopelessly bourgeois. - What do you intend to live on? - It's mad. - Hopelessly. - Oh, but it's nice. - Now, no amorous displays, comrade, I'm having my breakfast. - Why he hasn't even got a job. - He can have mine. Oh, it's going to be such fun. Mrs. John Smith. Oh, it sounds wonderful. Huh! If Mrs. John Smith sounds wonderful, that's love. - Sounds sort of funny to me. - Why, John? Tell you what I'll do. I'm going to get more than a job. I'm going to pull of a big deal today with a certain titled person. - Oh, John. - Tonight I can be a new man. It'll be all right in a minute. John, we'll be late, we'll never get to work. Good. Guess there's something wrong. - John? - Mmm. I've got a great idea. Oh. Come on, it's me. Oh, Diana, be careful what you're doing. No, it's no good, we'll have to take a tram. I'll see you tonight, darling. That big deal's in the bag. Bye, John. (Speaks Russian) - What's that? - What'd he say? That's goodbye in Russian. When you drive a car, it's goodbye in any language. - Bye, darling. - Bye. - Morning. - Morning, sir. Too bad about Lady Constance. Lady Constance?! But what's wrong? Well, they've taken her to a nursing home. - What? - She's very seriously ill. Her maid says that she's had a relapse - and she's seems to think - Well never mind what the maid says, - where's the nursing home? - Doctor Day's in Welbeck Street. Eighty Welbeck Street. So glad you've come. - Well, I had no idea she was so bad. - You don't know what I've been through. It's dreadful. She rallied after you left the other day. I told her that you called and she sunk into a coma. How awful, but, but if only she were well enough to talk, you see, there's so much to talk about. I know. The wedding. Lady Emily, there can't be a wedding. Oh, there can. We must look on the bright side of things. She'll be better. There'll be no delay about the wedding, I can assure you of that. Believe me, I wouldn't worry you about this at this moment, if it weren't absolutely necessary, but, well, you've got to know one thing. I'm not engaged to Constance. I never was. So that's it! How could you do such a thing to her, lying there? She must have suspected it, that's why all this happened. Lady Emily, you must believe me, - please - I must go to my child. I should prefer her to marry somebody else, somebody more worthy of her. - But Lady Emily, please let me - To my poor child, you are still her fianc?. You're entitled to see her, if you wish. But I must remind you, she's still very ill. So please act accordingly. No wait here. Get ready. He's outside, he's coming in now. Hurry up, lie down. How do I look? - Ghastly, I hope. - Good Doctor's orders. - Hello, Connie - Shh. Oh, Connie you poor thing Nicky, my love kiss me Please You won't ever leave, Nicky, will you? Mmm? You won't leave me? Oh, no, no, Connie, no. - Don't you worry, I'm going to get well. - Yes. Yes, you are. And we'll go away somewhere together, and we'll be happy, won't we? Well Oh Nicky, I must hurry and get well Well, there's no hurry, Constance, really. No, suppose not. We could always be married here, quietly. I must look such a fright, Nicky, I don't know how you can - bear to look at me. - No you don't, no, really, you don't. You look swell As a matter of fact, - you look remarkably well. - Time's up. Well, goodbye, Connie. - See you tomorrow, huh? - Mmm. - Lady Emily, I don't - Not now, please send the nurse in, will you, quickly! All right. Oh, I beg your pardon - What's this? - Not bad, eh? I'd like to go for her myself. Here, what's the big idea, that's my magazine? - That's my sister. - Oh, er nice girl. You bet she's a nice girl. Don't get thinking she isn't. - No, I won't, no. - Fine run today, sir. Oh, darling, this is going to cost an awful lot of money. Hello. Hello. Oh, it's you. Yes, it's only me. Haven't I met you before? Weren't you the girl we knocked down in the car'? - Yes, that's right. - Yes, that's right. - Yes, yes. You didn't break any bones. - Oh, no. - Well - Say, this is Diana Castle. - How do you do? I'm Reggie Baird. - How do you do? Oh, you're the Reggie that's always getting about. The life and soul of every party. Sort of person who never wants to go to bed, - isn't that so, darling? - Yes. No, the only time I'm late is when I'm seeing Nicky safely home. You ought to see him when he's had a couple. Nicky? Is that the Nicky Brooke you were telling me about? - Hmm-mm. - Nicky Brooke! Well, well, well, well, well - So you were talking about Nicky Brooke. - John doesn't like him. - John? - John. Oh! Oh, John doesn't like him. Well, I don't blame you. Seems he's a very extraordinary fellow. Don't you know Nicky? - No. - Oh, I know him awfully well. Yes and Constance. - That's the girl he's engaged to. - Yes, I know. We're engaged, too. What? Oh, congratulations. - Well, well, well, well - Thank you. Not at all. Congrat no, perhaps not. You and Nicky will have to have a double wedding. You know, same day, same church, same everything. Oh, we don't know when we'll be able to be married. John's out of work. Oh, John's out of work. Mmm, well, from what I see of the conditions of things in the old home town, I should say that you'll be very busy from now on. Oh, I do hope so. You see, I've got a brother in Canada and, I don't like to tell him we're engaged until John gets a job. Oh, he's funny that's way. He always imagines someone's trying to take advantage of me. Oh yes, I know the type. Always ready to slosh everybody. - Yes - That's Jim. That's Jim. He doesn't know his own strength. Yes, you'll have to watch out, my friend, and do the right thing by our Nell. These Canadians shoot first and talk afterwards. Ah, yes, bang, bang - Well, goodbye Reggie, old chap. - Goodbye, John. Remember me to Nicky when you see him. - Yes, I will. - Mmm Chaps like him live in a fool's paradise. Question of glands, I believe. - Goodbye. It's been, fun. - Goodbye. - Shall we dance? - Yes, darling. - Yes? - How is Lady Constance? - Doing as well as can be expected. - Well is she dangerously ill? She's doing as well as can be expected. Hello? Yes. She's doing as well as can be expected. I'll tell her. Tell me, Matron, er, how are you? - Doing as well as can be expected. - Yeah, I thought so. Nursing home wedding in this very room. And you in a coma, he simply can't deny the engagement. Told you it would work. Here's something I hate to miss. An offer from Oglethorpe endorsing somebody's perfume. Three hundred pounds! That'll be useful. This nursing home's costing a lot. There's absolutely no risk. An hour at Oglethorpes will just about see me through and it's the one place in the world I'll never run into him. - Well I hope you're right, my dear. - Safe as houses. I'm going. Hello? Hold on. Nicky's outside. Well, put him off, put him off, put him off... She can't see anyone now. Doctor's just given her the sleeping draught. Ah, so glad to see you, Lady Constance.

I'm entirely at your service. - Thank you so much. - Not at all. - Good morning. - Good morning. - We're quite ready for you, madam. - Thank you. - May I take your muff? - Thank you so much. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare, but, - haven't we met somewhere before? - We may have met. Lois of people think they know me because they've seen my pictures in magazines and on posters. - Like this one on the wall. - Oh, I see. - Lure is a precious thing these days. - Yes. But I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before. I'm so sorry. I was just wondering, do you know a Nicky Brooke? No, but I've heard a lot about him. My fianc? knows him very well. As a matter of fact, he doesn't think very much of him. Oh, that's too bad. You see I happen to be engaged to Nicky Brooke. - Oh then then you're Lady - Hmm-mm. I'm so terribly sorry. I'm sure Mr. Brooke's awfully nice. Oh, John's just prejudice for some reason. If your fianc? knows Nicky so well, surely I must know him. John who? John Smith. No, you wouldn't know him. Oh, he doesn't get around very much. Hello, Winnie. What on earth are you doing here? If Gibson sees you, he'll throw you out. - I want to see Diana. Where is she? - Well you can't, she's busy. - Oh, now just for one minute. - Here he comes Winnie. - Yes, Mr. Gibson. - Have you looked through these accounts? Er, er, no, Mr. Gibson. Oh, but there's one here that owes us money. - Oh, dear. - This one here. Send them a letter and tell them I want a check by return mail - Yes. - without fail. It's important. Yes, Mr. Gibson. There is John. I wish he wouldn't come here, Gibson doesn't like him. Persuade him to think more kindly of Nicky, won't you? - I will. John - Darling - Oh darling, you shouldn't come here. - Well why not? Nobody saw me. How soon will you be ready? - In about an hour, darling. - Oh - John - Mmm? - Tell me something. - Hmm-mm. Why have you got such a downer on Nicky Brooke? Well, no special reason. Why? - What is it? - I feel such a fool. I had to tell her of all people, that you disliked him. Well what on earth are you talking about? The girl he's engaged to, Lady Constance Westaker. John, I put my foot in it. - What, Lady Con where did you see her? - John! Where did you see her and when? Come on, darling, tell me, please. Oh, darling, don't be so violent, in the chair. - What, in there? - Yes. - In there now? - Yes, darling. - Hello, Constance. - on! Didn't the sleeping draught work or, are you walking in your sleep? Well No, I, I got well suddenly and You know her, John? John? Oh, so you're the man that doesn't think much of Nicky Brooke! After pretty big game, weren't you? Lure girl. - Well, what do you mean by that? - Well, listen Diana, I'll tell you. No, John. She's got the floor, go on. - Are you engaged to him? - Yes, but what's that got to do with it? - Oh, nothing. Except I am, too. - John? No. Nicky. Nicky Brooke. Oh, no. So that's how it is. Well, how many more names have you got? I must have been mad, Diana, but, well she had me stumped, lying there in that nursing home You probably put her there. Well, you're, you're welcome to him. Such as he is. Thanks. I've got him already. I love her and I'm going to marry her. Diana Oh, John what a wretched mess you've made of things. Everything could have been so grand and now this. It's still going to be grand. We're still engaged. Wasn't very nice of you Nicky, was it? Picking up with a little model girl while I was lying ill. Constance, I am glad you're feeling better, because there's something I've been wanting to say to you for weeks. I'm not going to marry you and I What's the matter, you're not feeling well? Well just sit down here, Constance, just relax a little. Now listen, Constance. I'm not going - Darling - to marry you. Oh! Oh, madam Oh! Listen, Diana, I know there's a lot to explain but you've got to listen to me. Oh nothing you've told me is true, so don't say anymore because I won't believe you. - But Diana, that's not fair, because - Oh, leave me alone! - But I - What is it? - Oh, it's you, is it? Come on, outside. - Treat him with respect, Winnie. - He's marrying a title. - What? He's going to be Mr. Lady Constance Westaker. You're going to make us both very unhappy. - Speak for yourself. - Well, it's no good pretending. Don't cause a scene in front of all these people. Well, I know I've been an idiot, Diana - Hey, I want you - If I've been an idiot Diana But I'm trying to make things easy for us. Now you're going to listen to me. I won't listen to anything from you. - You will. - I won't. You will listen to reason, if I have to tie you down. Out! To you everything's a Windstorm, hm? Well to me you're nothing but a brainstorm. Throw this man out! Got it? Yes, it's true, every word. Print it and pass it on to all the other newspapers, will you, darling? Yes, I'd like to break up this little romance of his. Taxi. Here you are, sir. - What's that? - Your cloakroom ticket, sir. Oh, thanks. Seventy-seven Brampton Court. Oh, we've been over everything until I'm sick of it. What's the use? We're through. Let's forget it. Well, I don't think you're being very fair, Diana. You can't be fair about love. You either feel one way or the other. And I feel the other. - That's not true - Oh, can't you see I'm fed up? Oh, go away! I never want to see you again, Mr. John Smith! Nicky Brooke! Thank you. - Oh, excuse me, I - That's all right, - You free? - Yes, sir. Well go to the Swiss Airline in Piccadilly, will you? Very good. Jim! - What on earth are you doing here? - Trouble is I didn't get here soon enough. Oh Oh, Jim, I'm so glad you've come. Oh, Jim. I'm so tired. I should say you would be tired. Standing around in your underwear all over the British Empire. Oh, Jim, I I haven't seen you for years and all you can do is to criticize me. It's only because I've got to look after you. It's might lucky you've kept out of trouble. Undressing like that! Co Ooh, comrade, have you seen the newspapers? All about you and your boyfriend. - What boyfriend? - A snake in the grass. A millionaire and I took him to my bosom as a friend. - Look what he's done to you. - What's he done to you? Ah, there, there - "Boyfriend Lure girl. " - That's her. You're certainly in the headlines now. - This is my brother. - Hm? - Jim. - on! Can't you ever shut up, Max? And you told me you hadn't been up to anything. It wasn't anything. And even if it was, it's all over. - Where is this man? - I don't know, and I don't care. Just forget him. He's not worth bothering about. It's no bother at all. I'm looking forward to meeting this bloke who gets engaged to my sister under another name. - Where is he? - I told you, I don't know. All right. If you won't tell me, this newspaper will. Jim! What are you going to do? Plenty. This all comes as standing around in your underwear. If he finds him, he'll do something terrible! I hope he hits him hard. Name please? - Brooke. - Number seven, sir - Well, goodbye, Reggie. - Goodbye, old boy. Perhaps she'll change her mind. I've phoned her all day, she just cuts me off. Any statement for the London Tribune? - No, but I - All right, all right. - All right, I'll deal with it. - Goodbye, Reggie. They tell me you wrote this stuff. Where is this Nicky Brooke? - Who are you? - I'm her brother. And I'm just aching to lay my hands on him. Ah, too late. One of my reporters just saw him off to Lindenelt. - Where's that? - Switzerland. He does a lot of mountain climbing. Trying a spot of it now to get women off his mind, I expect. So he's gone. That's too bad. One of these kiss and run fellows. Figures like all these rich blokes, he can do as he jolly well pleases. Switzerland, eh? Too bad you couldn't have reached him, I'd like to have covered that fight. Yeah - Name please? - Oh, Jim Castle. - Number twelve, sir. - Thanks. Have you heard from Diana? Yes, I've just been on to her, but she says she's through. She can't do this to me. She's hot news, headlines. Why the Lily's Cold Cream people are flaking the life out of me. They even want us to go to Switzerland to cash in on the publicity. Well then, maybe if you went to see her, - you could - Don't interrupt, please, please, please. - I tell you what, I'll go and see her. - Good idea, Mr. Gibson. This is big stuff. Nicky Brooke goes to Switzerland, the now Diana Castle follows him to Switzerland where love will find a way. So use Lily's Cold Cream and hold your man. - Oh, boy! That's got heart. - Sounds good. Get me out that last poster of Diana. You know the one. - Oh, you'd better not, Mr. Gibson. - Hmm? She says her brother's on the war path about her posing like that. Well, if that's going to worry her, I won't tell her we're taking it. Anyway, her brother won't see it in Switzerland, - and what he doesn't know won't worry him. - No, Mr. Gibson. "Gone to Lindenelt for important business. Back in two days, love Jim". And Lindenelt's where John said he was going. - I hope the save the peace - Oh, he'll do something awful. He'll kill John. And then they'll hang Jim. The police! That's it, we'll notify the Swiss police. There will be a help, with both of them up the mountain. What do you think the Swiss cops are, anyway, mountain goats? Oh you don't know Jim when he gets started. I tell you, he'll kill John and I love him! You mean to say you love him? And you let that poor guy call you up a dozen times begging you to go with him. - Why on earth didn't you go? - Because I hate him! - Oh, come in. - A fine time to desert me. - Sorry, but I'm through with advertising. - Okay, quit, but later, I need you now. A big campaign for selling Lily's Cold Cream in Switzerland. Switzerland. It's an ideal place to sell Lily's Cold Cream. We'll beat the ultra-violet rays of the sun right on their own ground. That's why I need you, you've got just the complexion. All you've got to do is go to the best hotels and demonstrate. First stop, Lindenelt. - When I get you there - Did you did you say Lindenelt? - Yeah. - When can we get there? - Tomorrow morning. - All right, Mr. Gibson, I'll go. - But remember, I don't take off a stitch. - You don't have to. Lily's Cold Cream is only for the face. Now go and pack, cos the plane leaves in an hour. A plane in an hour Patsy, come and help me. (singing) I will tell it immediately, sir. I want to see Mr. Nicholas Brooke. What's his room number'? Two hundred and forty-seven, if he ever comes back. Believe it or not, he's up a mountain, in Vinca, the Charberg, - and he's climbing it from the West side. - Do you mean that's dangerous? Dangerous! It's a living suicide. Englishmen. They make such a joke of dying and such a dreary business of living. - Give me a gin and mix, will you? - Yes, sir. Ah, Mr. Brooke, so you turned back after all. Yes, the strap broke. I'm going to make it today somehow, that's Here, would you like to get that fixed for me? - Certainly, sir. - Thanks. Say, is the Charberg as dangerous as they say? - Well, it isn't too easy, sir. - You going up to Charberg? Give me a whisky and soda, would you? I'm just starting off up there, going up at the West side. Oh, I'd like to have a look at that West side myself. Yeah, you ought to someday, it's a marvelous view. Yeah, there's something up there I'm just aching to see. You wouldn't like to join forces, would you? - Yes, sure. Er, done much climbing? - A bit, in Canada. (Yodelling) Well, if you're ready, I may as well get my ski boots on. - You've got some skis? - Yeah, outside. Well, I'll meet you out there. I've got to get a new pair myself. Grand. What is all this? - Her picture looks familiar. - The Lure girl. If she can't get him, she can get me anytime. Fancy worrying about him after the way he's treated her. Oh, but you are the Lure girl, aren't you? - Good luck, Diana. - Don't marry him, dear. They recognize you sister. Thank you friends, for the warm and enthusiastic reception for the little lady at my side. It will give her courage to go on with her errand of love and forgiveness. Will you take down that awful poster? Lady, that posters your hotel bill and your return ticket. Besides, its art and it'll do Lily's a lot of good. It won't do you any good or me either if my brother sees it. I don't know whether you know it, but he's in Linden now. So what? Ah, relax, just leave it to me. But you don't know my brother when he gets started. Listen, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Besides, these boys who like to play cowboy are just duck soup to me. If ever I get tough with him, he'll fold up like an accordion. Jim! - Hi ya, pal. - Who are you? Me? I'm just the biggest liar in Switzerland. Oh, I get you. You're the guy who's been fooling around with my sister. Tell him I'm not Nicky Brooke. - Tell him before it's too late. - This is Mr. Gibson. - Howdy. - Howdy. What? Gibson. Then if he's not the rat, where is he? Wait till I lay hands on him. No jury would convict a man for defending his sister's honor. Out West, we'd elect him mayor. - But this is England. - No, it's Switzerland. Now listen Oh, Jim, let's go back to London together. That's where I left you. Why didn't you stop there? I couldn't the way you were carrying on, and it'll only mean trouble if you stay here. Oh, everything's a horrible mistake. A horrible mistake! Then what do you call this? - Art, brother. - Shut up! And you said you were through with stripping. But I didn't know anything about it, did I, Mr. Gibson. What's he got to do with it? Oh, I see, you're the guy that made her do it.
