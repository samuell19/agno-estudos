You must lose yourself in the forest to meet the stranger. Who are you? My name is Haruki. Sorry for sneaking up. I was in the forest, I got lost and... happened upon... your house. It's astonishing. It's a former monastery. Do you feel alright? - You look exhausted. - I walked a lot. Sit down. Would you like a drink? No, thank you. Do you live around here? I live in the house on the opposite side. What's he doing ? He's looking for solutions. Do you know Yoctddo Tammnn? No. He's a Japanese film maker. Him? VVhy's a Japanese film maker out here? He's preparing his next film. That's curious. You find it curious? I met an Asian man yesterday, near my house. That's not him. I'll let you work. Are you going through the forest? I'll take you as far as the road. I know a shortcut. What's your name? Mathilde. - Mine is Martin. - Nice to meet you. So you work with... Yogi? Yoctido. Yes. I'm his assistant. How does one become assistant to a Japanese film maker? V's/hen I went to live in Japan for two years, I was already an admirer of his films. I met him and quickly earned his trust. V's/hen it looked like he'd make a film in France, he called. I helped mount the project, and stayed on. So, why here? Yoshido insisted on finishing his script on the film's locations. The locations inspired the story. The shoot begins in a month, in the house and surrounding am. Have you ever heard of Haruki Nozaki? Haruki? Yes. Do you know him? No. Haruki was Yoshidds writer friend. He was little known in France. He spent 10 years in that house. There, he began his last novel, "Life at a Distance." He died before he could finish it. Yoshido's script was born out of it. Yoshido made several trips here alone to moot Harald’: ghost. Until he decided to do the film here. His ghost? Yes... Yoshido believes in ghosts. VVill his film be a ghost story? Partially. Only mm». And you? You live here? No. I just moved here. But it's... temporary. Thank you, very much... for this walk. Keep going and you'll come to your house. Great. Goodbye. Maybe... Can we meet again? I'll give you my number. U... 84». 6... 34». 70. See you soon. You gave me quite a start! Sorry. You should stop. It's late. I'll finish tomorrow. It's very beautiful... You can read my writing? Yes. Without any trouble. You don't find it too... impossible. Actually, yes. Doing the impossible is a worthy goal, no? You'll manage. I'd like it to go faster, but I'm waiting for something that isn't in my head. Not yet. Haruki was waiting too. He talks about this wait at several points in his novel. Did I tell you that the last pages of his manuscript are drawings? No. He couldn't write anymore, so he drew. V's/ho was that man you walked home? His name is Martin. He lives in a house nearby. He got lost in the forest. Invite him over after my location scout. Is Alice coming tomorrow? Yes, in the afternoon. We'll be four at dinner. Can we manage that? Yes, of course. Your French is improving. Today, I woke up bilingual! "The time had come "for each of them to face the enigma: "V's/hat were they to become? "V's/ere they still able to decide "what their lives would be?" Haruki? Yes? You're dead, aren't you? Yes. How can I talk to you if you're dead? V's/hat about you? How did you come back? Como book? Yes, comeback. Did you go into the forest? Yes. Did you meet the stranger? Yes. You shouldn't stay here with me. You must listen for the call. Hello, Mathilde! I'm sorry. I'm fine. Let's get out of here. Hold on. Take my hand. - This way. - Okay. No, this way, it's shorter. I'm really sorry. Ali's well, I assure you. I didn't hurt you? No. There was a gust of wind. I... I couldn't control my descent. I'm not a very gifted parachutist. Don't be discouraged. Do you want me to help you fold it? You know how? I think I still remember. There. I can't thank you enough. My name is Yoshido. I'm Caroline. Winn are you going, Mr. Yoshido? Nowhere. I'm location scouting. I'm looking for a lone tree on a hilltop. It's just what I wanted, without knowing it. I'm glad. I didn't know bears lived here. Actually, there were three of us, but a hunter killed his mother a few clays ago. Anyway, your French is very good. Far better than mine. The same goes for your Slovenian. What's that? The main thing is that we understand each other. Do you understand me now? Yes. Incredible. What's incredible? Language- "Language achieves, in breaking silence, "what silence wants but can't obtain." Marlena Pony. "Linguistic danger to spiritual thinking. "Each word is a prejudice." Nietzsche! I'm happy to be back here. It is your house. Not anymore, and it's better that way. Can you stay a few clays? I'd like to, but I must be back tomorrow. The printer needs Haruki's drawings as soon as possible. The novel's release is next month. So soon? Oluy, let's spea k French, even though I didn't wake up bilingual. Thank you.
