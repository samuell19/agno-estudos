Why are you here? Did the girl kill her? It wasn't a girl. It was a wicked witch who turned into one. - A witch? - Yes. Witches can do anything. POISON FOR THE FAIRIES We're going to review the addition of mixed fractions. Two and two-thirds plus four and two-eighths plus five and six-tenths. The same. Another problem. - Three-ninths plus... - Good morning, Miss. Good morning. How can I help you? Sorry I've interrupted. I'm bringing in a new student. Although classes are well under way, she has just been enrolled. - It's not a problem. - Thank you. Excuse me. - Very well. What's your name? - Flavia. - And your last name? - Gorivar. Tell your parents they must buy your uniform. Take a seat over there. - Veronica. - Yes? Let your classmate share your workbook with you. Yes, miss. What did you say your name was? Flavia. - That's not a name. - Yes, it is. But it's a spider's name. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Go away. - Why did you say I have a spider's name? - That's my spider's name. Do you have a spider at home? This big. - Why do you have it? - To cast spells. DUBLIN SCHOOL - I'm home, Grandma. - Come in, Veronica. - Did you behave in school? - Yes, Grandma. Good. Go bathe and then have a snack. I think Carmen baked a cake for you. - But do your homework. - Yes. At that time, Prince Charming found the white roe deer. But then the moon disappeared behind black clouds - and the witches began their Sabbath. - What is a Sabbath? Well, it's like a dance where witches meet with the devil. What for? To make their pacts. To ask him for magical powers. Anyway. - Keep reading. - Later. Get out, now. It's very late. I'm cold. It won't last. Her mom picked her up from school. She's has a very pretty car. I think they're very rich. Tell me about it later. Finish your hot chocolate. Nanna, why don't I remember my mother? Because you were very young when the accident happened. Why didn't my grandma die? She was not in the car. She didn't live with you. Do you miss your mother? No. I'm going to bed, Mom. I'll be right there. Say goodnight to Dad. Good night, Dad. Boy, oh, boy. What a beautiful little lady! Would you honor me with your presence at the fair this Sunday? It's a date then. Don't forget. - Dad. - Hm? Can we have a spider? Betty will sleep in her box. Mom? - Why do other girls pray before bedtime? - They're afraid. - But not you. - No. Not me. See you tomorrow, darling. I never saw anything Maybe I was too young But everyone said that the house was haunted. - Did you ever see anything? - Nothing. Well, I did. One night I heard chains clanking. Like moaning. - Who was it? - Who knows. I got under the covers and hid. Silly Nanna. You should have taken a peek. That way you'd know what ghosts look like. - Who says I haven't seen them? - Where? That's for another day. Or you'll never get up in the morning. How do you make a pact with the devil? Miss Lourdes. Miss Aurora asked me to bring her a box of chalk. She ran out. - What's the magic word? - Please. I'll get it. I realize that I'm causing a problem, but it's unavoidable. I'd like to wait for you. But classes have started so I can't. It's all right, I understand. The girls can't go without classes. How long is your trip? I don't know. My son-in-law is very ill and my daughter is alone. Maybe a few months. When do you leave? Tomorrow. Please tell the girls good-bye for me. I can't, I'll start crying. Of course. What are you doing? I was listening. Is Miss Ellis leaving? That's none of your business. You'll find out when the time is right. Here. Thank you, miss. - Here they are. - Thanks. We're copying the map of France. Look for it on page 22. Yes, teacher. - What are you doing? - English homework. I forgot to do it. Flavia! No talking. "There will be no classes. Miss Ellis is leaving the school." - How did you know? - I know what's going to happen. Tell me the truth. I have a friend who tells me everything I ask him. Who is it? An owl. Don't be afraid. He's very good. But... It's dead. Don't say that. He'll get mad. - It's dead. It's stuffed. - They all say that. But he tells me a lot. - Veronica, go play in the yard. - Yes, Nanna. Let's go. - Have him tell you something now. - It's daytime, he only speaks at night. That's a lie. That's why at school they say you're a liar. What about Miss Ellis? At night when no one is looking he flies to my bedroom and we talk. - Why did he choose you? - I can't tell you the reason. - It's a secret. - Please... - You won't believe me. - I will. If I tell you and you tell someone else, you'll pay. I won't tell anyone. I'm not really how I look. I'm not a girl. I'm a witch. Dad, do witches exist? No, princess. Of course not. Witches don't exist. How about before, many years ago? Never. At that time, people were very ignorant. They thought some women had a pact with the devil, so they burned them alive. They burned them? Yes. They thought it was the only way to get rid of them. - Who told you about witches? - A friend from school. Tell her she's mistaken. No one has ever seen a real witch. It's the prettiest spider I've ever had. It has a yellow spot on top. - Bring it in tomorrow. - No. Come on over and I'll show it to you. I can't. I have piano lessons. - Every day? - Tuesdays and Thursdays. But I have to practice at home. I hate the piano. Madame? Madame, I'm here. Madame! Madame Rickard! You're always late. I don't like that. We got out late. Well, let's see. Play the serenata. Yes, Madame. That's an F-sharp, Flavia. You haven't been practicing. - I've had a lot of homework. - That's not an excuse. Let's see. Play it all the way through and I'll give you some of those cookies you like. - Again? - Yes. From the top. Now it looks like a castle. But... we need a bridge here. It looks very pretty. When it dries we'll add the door. Come on, let's wash up. Don't tell anyone about the owl. - You didn't predict it. Someone told you. - That's not true! Dad says there are no fortune-tellers or witches. Yes there are. I'm a witch. A horrible old witch. Let's see. Turn into one. No. You'll get scared. I won't get scared. Another day. It used to play fine. But it broke, and it's been like that ever since. - Why two pianos? - This is a Pianola. It was my mom's. - Veronica, where are your parents? - They died. And do you live alone with your Nanna? Yes. Are all these musical scores? Flavia... you really wouldn't get scared if I turned into a witch? - No. - Wait here. Come up, Flavia. Where are you going? Veronica. Veronica? Veronica? Veronica, come out. Don't... We were playing hide-and-seek and Flavia came looking for me. You've done a bad thing. There's no playing in the house. Why doesn't Grandma like anyone to see her? Some day when you're old and sick you'll understand. Go ask your grandma for forgiveness. Woe, Nanna... None of that. You've been very bad today. Either you apologize or no story tonight. Well... Tell her your friend didn't know she was there, and that it won't happen again. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Flavia. What's wrong? That old lady. That horrible old lady. There's no one. You had a nightmare. It was just a bad dream. Don't go. Don't go, please. No. I'm not leaving. Calm down, sweetie. I'm here. I didn't say anything. Really. To no one. If you told someone, I'll know it. And you'll be in trouble. - I can show you my spider later. - I can't. - You don't have piano lessons today. - But I have to study. Veronica... Can you cast a spell to end my piano lessons? - Watch that step. - Uh-huh. Everything's ready. - Where did you get those candles? - I painted them. - Why black? - That's the way the devil likes them. N ow wat? Give me your piano book. N o, Vevro oCa We need it for the spell. But my mom will scold me. Tell her you lost it. Besides, you won't need it anymore. Close your eyes and think of your teacher. Satan... Satan... I invoke you. Don't laugh or you'll ruin everything. Why do you do that? You must give blood to the devil so he'll listen to us. - Give me your finger. - No, not mine. Nothing can be done without you. Does it hurt a lot? Satan... ...we are making a pact with you. Take Madame Recal. Madame Rickard. Madame Rickard. She makes us suffer. We don't want her. Take her far away and don't ever let her return. - Did you make the map? - Yes. I didn't get to color it. Can I borrow your crayons? - I don't have any. - What's this? Leave it. They're not crayons. Of course not. There's a spell in that box. Can't you see she's a witch? You're jealous. You're jealous. - Let me borrow your crayons. - I don't have any. Thank you. You were warned last time, Veronica. You could get expelled from school for that. I didn't give her the box. She took it. It's not about that. You know you can't bring animals to school. Especially those critters. I didn't bring it in. It's not mine. Veronica, besides what you have done... Come in. Did you call for me? Yes. Come in. Flavia, tell me the truth. Veronica says you brought in that horrible creature in the crayon box. Is that true? Did you do it? Answer me! Stay there until your parents come for you. Flavia. - Flavia! Wait for me. - What do you want? Don't be mad at me. I had to blame you or I would have gotten expelled. I was punished because of you. I won't spend time with you anymore. Don't be like that. I will. Don't talk to me ever again. I don't want to be your friend. No, not that one. A little higher. The one with a red bow. Bring that one. This is it. Were they my mother's? Yes, I gave them to her when she was a child. She saved them. You'll like them. They're yours now. Thank you, Grandma. Take good care of them. Much better. Play it again while I get some tea. Madame? Madame? What happened? - Did you see what he's playing with? - Let him be. I keep him quiet that way. How's Flavia? She's taking it hard. She went to bed early. It was a shock seeing her teacher dead. You were expecting it, right? Yes. Poor woman, even after two strokes she didn't take care of herself. She smoked constantly. She was sentenced. It'll be hard for Flavia to get used to a new teacher. She really cared about Madame Rickard. She was very sweet to your daughter. Poor woman. Why do these things happen? Flavia? Flavia, look who's here. Look who came to visit. - How are you? - Hi. Don't take Hippie. He has to eat. I'll bring some gelatin later. Thank you, ma'am. Veronica, I didn't want Madame Rickard to die. We asked to have her taken away and never to come back. But not to die! Shut up. They'll hear you. Have you told anyone about the spell? No. If someone finds out, you'll be in trouble. You'll go to jail. Swear you'll never mention this to anyone. Besides, all pacts with the devil have to be secret. If you talk about it he'll appear. You have a very pretty room. Yes, I'm getting new curtains. Who gives you so many toys? My parents. I've never seen a doll like this. - I'll give you whatever you want for her. - No. Betty is the doll I love the most. If I wanted to I could take her. My mom wouldn't let you. I can do anything. Come at night, enter through the window and take her. Veronica... Flavia. Flavia! Here, you dropped it. Thank you. What is it? My pen. My dad brought it from the United States. - Is it gold? - I don't know. - Isn't it pretty? - Yes. I like it a lot. Come get a snack. Are you done with homework? Yes. What are you doing? A witch. - This looks like a mummy. - What's a mummy? One of those dead bodies that are buried and doesn't rot. - Is there such a thing? - Of course there is. I've seen them. Veronica. What's this? A pen that Flavia gave to me. This is very expensive. You shouldn't have accepted it. I know. But she wanted to. - Hi. - Hi. - Do you have money? - Mm-hmm. - How much? - Twenty pesos. Good. We're not going to class today. - Why? - We're going somewhere else. That's ditching. If we get caught, they'll flunk us. I'm not going. You'll do what I tell you to do. Always. Or you'll be sorry. N o oe saw us - Where are we going? - To see mummies. What?! - They're so ugly. - They're dead people. - Why were they mummified? - No. That's how they found them. Let me tell you... they're not really dead. At night they walk around the convent. - How do you know? - I've seen them. Nanna, is the food ready? I'm hungry. In 15 minutes. Get out of here. You make me nervous. Read your storybook. I don't like them. They're silly. They don't mention anything about witches. Of course not. Fairies don't get along with witches. They're afraid of them. Why? The witches are their enemies and they kill them. How? Who knows? Stop eating fruit. Did you hear me? Put that apple down. Tell me how. Well... uh... Have you seen the boiling pots that witches have? They throw in lizard tails, cemetery dirt, ashes from crosses, snakes, and lots of rubbish. You know what they make? Poison. Poison for the fairies. It's pretty. Who set it up? My nanny Carmen does it every year. - Don't you have one at home? - No. We don't believe in that. - How about a tree? - Sometimes. But not this year. The doctor said to take me to the farm. - What farm? - My father's. He has cows and horses. And a very large lake with ducks. - I don't believe you. - We do. We always go there on vacation. I'm learning to ride horses. I want to go with you. I don't know. We never go with anyone. I don't care. Tell your father that you want me to go. - What if he doesn't want to? - Lf he doesn't, I'll get mad at you. I don't know. She's a strange girl. There's something weird about her. I must admit, I don't like that friendship. It may be, my love. But we can't choose Flavia's friends. Besides, it's a responsibility. Why? There's no problem. Flavia insisted on it. Do you think they'll let Veronica go? We'll ask. If they don't let her, it's not our fault. All right. You really spoil her. Whatever your daughter wants she gets. We're here, Veronica! - Where is it? - It's everything you see here. On both sides? - Yes, on both sides. - Where does it end? Further down. You can't see from here. Look, there's the lake! - Didn't I tell you? - A lake. This is my bedroom. You'll sleep in here with me. - Do you like it? - Yes. Take your clothes out and hang them in the closet. Your dad is really rich, isn't he? Yeah. I think so. I will be very rich, too. What's this? The barn. - It's pretty. - Inside is a great place to play, too. Let's take a look. I hide up there when I don't want to see anyone. - Do you want to sit on the straw? - Later. - What's that? - That's the village cemetery. - Let's go. - To the cemetery? Why not? Are you afraid? - No. Not during the day. - Let's go then. - What are you looking for? - I don't know. A lot of things. Look. - This is very old. - Yeah, the fence over there fell over. To?o the watchman lives here. - Who is he? - He takes care of the farm. He's very nice to me. Let's see if he has any candy. To?o! To?o! To?o? He's not here. Let's go. Wait. Let me look around. Let's go. Why can't we go now? My dad won't let me. He says the lake is dangerous. We'll ask To?o to come with us another day. It'll be more exciting to go alone. But you don't know how to row. Veronica, do you ever think of Madame Rickard? - Why? - Because it's our fault she's dead. It's the devil's doing. I often think of her. And I feel sorry for her. She was very nice to me. What are these cars? My dad bought them. They're over 100 years old. - Can we race? - How? They don't run. They're horse drawn. Just pretend there are horses. Giddy up, horse! Giddy up! Hurry up. They're catching up. But this is really dirty. You ruin everything. What do you see? - That. - That pot? That's not a pot. It's a cauldron. Let's take it. What for? I'll tell you a secret. You'll help with something very important. - What is it? - Poison for the fairies. - It has to be out of sight. - We can ask To?o to... Don't be silly. No one must know. Just you and me. In the barn then! Yes. We'll cover it well. What's that cross? To?o says the devil used to appear here. They put it there to scare him off. Why kill the fairies? They don't want us. They hate witches. - What do you do with the poison? - I'll tell you later. In that corner. No one will find it here. I'm tired. What will you do with it? The poison. You put in places where there are mushrooms and flowers... That's where the fairies gather on a full moon. Can we see them? M aybe - Who showed you how to make poison? - Other witches. It's very complicated. We have to get spider and toad legs... ...snakes, ashes... Where are you going to find that? We'll have to find it. Once we have everything we add it to the water and boil it. That's going to smell nasty. The fairies will die when they smell it. That's wicked. Don't be silly. Witches have to be wicked. I want to be the most wicked of all. I caught a big one. Bring the jar. - We have a lot. - We have enough. There aren't any fish in here. Yes, there are. To?o fishes everyday. We didn't use any bait. We have to get worms. We'll add the leftovers to the poison. Where can we find the lizards? At the old church. It's hard to catch them. They always slip away. It doesn't matter. We just need the tails. It'll be a good idea to have a whole lizard. Ah, you don't know. Yes I do. I got one. It's really dangerous. What if something happens? Nothing will happen to me. What about me? We're in the same boat. Undo the rope. - You know how to row? - It's easy. Just push the water back. That's it! - Are you sure? - The last time I got close and I saw them. There were like a thousand toads. Give me a hand. I see them! I see them! Veronica! The boat! That was scary, huh? Why are you laughing? Look at your legs. Why would you even get in the water? It's cold and dirty. I didn't get in. I slipped. Your father had warned you, Flavia, not to go near the lake. I was looking for a toad. A toad? What for? Just to look at it. That's silly. Look at these shoes. When you're done I'll give you an alcohol rub. You both smell like a swamp. - Why did you tell? - It slipped. Don't get mad. - We have the toad. Now what? - We have to get a snake. - Those are poisonous. - We only need the skin. There's one in To?o's cabin. Go get it, now. - No. Not me. - I'll warn you if he comes. He knows you. It's because... I'm afraid of snakes. It's dead. I'm telling you to go. - When will you be done? - We still need a lot of things. What do we need? Soil from a cemetery and a wooden cross from a tomb. Really? Yes. We burn the cross and add the ashes to the poison. We can go now. No. It has to be at midnight. - I'm not going. - You said you'd help. I don't care. I'm not going! I'm not going... You've been next to the fire too long. It's bad for you. - A little longer. - Fine. I'll get the bed ready. Flavia. I saw Madame Rickard last night. - Who? - Your teacher. I heard footsteps and she was there, on the steps. But... she's dead. Yes, she's come back to scare us. Madame? Madame Rickard? Madame? - What are you doing? - Nothing. You don't want to play? Veronica. Do you think Madame Pickard will return? Yes. She wants revenge by scaring us. - Can we make her go away? - We can. But you won't want to. - What? - Go to the cemetery tonight. She'll see that we're not scared and leave. - Are you sure? - It never fails. Don't fall asleep, Flavia. - I'm sleepy. - We're leaving. - What time is it? - Ten to eleven. I'm sleepy, Veronica. No, get up now. Where's the lantern? Under the bed. It's cold. Yeah. We'll take our coats. Get dressed and don't make any noise. - Turn the lantern on. I can't see. - No. Not here. - Do we have to go farther? - We have to get the cross. There's a cross! It's too big. We'll get the dirt. Look. That one. Veronica, did you hear that? - What? - Footsteps. No. - I did. Let's go. - Give me some light. I've almost got it. Hey, count the steps. Over...? What are you doing here? You've gone too far. I can't believe it. Have you two gone mad? Don't cry. Answer me! What were you doing in the cemetery? Looking for dirt. Dirt? From a cemetery? What for? We're making poison for the fairies. What did you say? Answer me! It's a game, sir. Outrageous. I don't know what to say. You... go to bed. We'll talk tomorrow. Flavia, don't forget to wash your hands with alcohol. Yes, Dad. But Veronica, I had to tell him! Don't talk to me. Not even a word. - What did you want me to do? - You'll pay dearly for this. Veronica. Veronica. Veronica, don't leave. Don't be upset with me. You promised not to mention the poison. It was a secret. There was nothing wrong it. Wait till the witches come to pull your eyes out. - Why are you here? Following me? - I came to help you. I don't need your help. I can do everything by myself. Were you serious about them taking my eyes out? I was. They'll cut your tongue out, too. So you won't tell their secrets. No, please! Tell them not to! - What will you give me? - Whatever you want. I want Hippie. Come, Hippie. Let's go. - What's wrong with the car, Dad? - It's not running well, princess. I have to go to Mexico City. - Are we all leaving? - No, it's a business trip. I'll be back tomorrow. - When do you leave? - When I'm done here. Give me a kiss. Are you spending the night at home in Mexico City? Of course, precious. Where else? - Flavia! - Yes, Mom? Get Veronica. Wash your hands before dinner. Yes, Mom. Hippie, come! Yeah, spoil him. He gets more mischievous every day. He got in the car and your dad had to drive him back. - We're leaving Sunday. Did you know? - Yes. We have school on Monday. I don't feel like going back to school. - What about the poison? - Everything is ready. - When are we going to do it? - Tomorrow night, but not with you. Don't be like that. I want to watch. Will you give me Hippie? Forever? Give him to me, now. Tell me he's mine. - He's yours. - Swear it. Not like that. Say: I swear I'll never take Hippie away from Veronica. "I swear I'll never try to take Hippie from Veronica." If I do, may the witches come and take my eyes out. "If I do, may the witches..." Don't cry. I'm sure your dad will give you another one. - The lights are out. They're in bed. - Yes. It's very late. Let's go and don't make any noise. Are you taking him? I just thought of something. To do magic all witches need a black cat. A cat. Do you have a cat? No. But I'll take Hippie. - He might get scared. - Why would he? Come here. - What are you looking at? - The moon. It's so big. - Is that good? - It's good for us witches. Shut him up. They'll hear him. Flavia! Put the ladder up! Come back, Flavia! Please. Please, Flavia! Please! Come back, Flavia. Flavia! Flavia! Help me, Flavia! Flavia! Flavia! Flavia! Help me, Flavia! Flavia. Please, Flavia. Please, help me, Flavia. Please! Please, Flavia...
