(whistles jauntily) (moody funk music) - You tell Mr. Jonathan that I left. If he won't do me, nobody will. But nothing. - Mm. - Good morning, may I help... (ominous chord) - The boss is back in town. He wants to talk to ya. You didn't actually think you could hide, did ya? Come on. - Stop it, let go! Get outta here, I don't have to talk to you. - You'd better come along quietly. - What in the world is going on in here? - Come on. - Don't you touch her! I'll call the police.

Come on. - Okay, now what? - So uh, Mr. Jonathan.

I ought to call the police. - Oh no no, lady, you got it all wrong, it's just-- - I know, don't say it. They attacked you, right? - Yeah, we attacked him. - As a matter of fact, they did. You know, they came at me like a pair of sharks and somebody ought to teach those girls some manners, you know that? ♫ Nah nah nah nah nah nah - I guess it's not your fault. They've done that sort of thing before. It's time those two learned a lesson. - Yeah, teach us a lesson. - Maybe I'd better go. - [Mrs. Simpson] I think I'll teach him a lesson. - [Daughter] Oh, momma! - [Jonathan] I swear to god. Jesus. Please, I-- - Now, isn't this better than those kids? Momma still came to help. And this way they can see just who is boss. - [Daughter] Show us, momma, show us. - I just came here to do your hair and, uh, serve. Oh god. What happened here? Where'd everybody go? - There was a little problem. - Where's Artie and Richard? Artie? - He's gone, Jonathan. They're both gone. They wanted to wait to talk with you but I made Artie go home, he was hurt. - Hurt? - I thought Richard should go with him. - How'd he get hurt? - Couldn't we sit down? - [Jonathan] Okay, run it down, what happened? - Two men came in, they work for a man I knew. A man I used to work for. They demanded I leave with him to go back to him, and when Artie tried to help me they roughed him up pretty bad. Thank goodness he's alright now. I'm sorry about all this, I'm leaving, but I had to tell you personally. - Who is this jive punk anyway? - Jonathan, I know it must sound pretty weird, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. - Where are you going? - Look, I balanced the books to today's receipts. Everything's in the desk there. I'm just sorry for any trouble I might have caused you. (Jonathan chuckles) - Relax. You ain't goin' anywhere. At least until I've got the whole story anyway. - It's no good, Jonathan. Best thing is just for me to leave. This guy's too powerful to fight, believe me, I know him. - Come on inside. Sit down. Alright, let's have it from the top. What's goin' on? - Alright. I worked for this guy before I came here. - What guy? - That doesn't matter. He wanted to keep me. I mean, the whole bit. Mercedes, jewels, stay at his mansion. Couldn't dig it and I left. I don't know. Maybe I should leave town or somethin', I don't know. - That's bullshit. What I don't understand is what all the strong arm business is about. - Hey, nobody walks out on him. Nobody. That's why I've got to go. - Fuck that. The only place you're goin' is to dinner with me. - Jonathan, I don't think you understand. - See, baby, there ain't slaves anymore.

She promised she'd call tonight. - Do you believe her? - [Thug] She'll call. - I can take that as your own personal guarantee? - What else could I do? There were people there, you said you didn't wanna create a scene. - Go back to the place she's working, make sure she calls. - [Thug] I don't understand, first you ask me to-- - I told you before, schmuck. You've got to know the people you're dealing with. I know Miss St. John. You say she's working for a hairdresser. Rip the joint apart. She'll call. (suspenseful music) - [Thug] (chuckles) Yeah.

We'll play it your way. Brenda, darling. Would you mind stepping out by the pool for a minute? - [Brenda] Of course. - Would you care for a cup of coffee? (suspenseful music) - Why hello, Jonathan, I'm surprised to see you here. Did you call for me, dear? - This gentleman, your former hairdresser, I believe, would like to talk to you about something. - Come on, Brenda, get your things and let's go. - Aren't you assuming quite a lot? Stop it, all of you. I don't know what you're doing here but why don't you just go away? Quietly. - A couple of my boys, got out of line at your place yesterday. I'm sorry. This ought to more than cover the damages. - Is this shit for real? - I made a mistake, Jonathan. This is where I want to be. I belong here. - Okay. You've got it. Bought and paid for. But your hair looks like shit that way. - I'm sorry if I've caused a problem for you. - Young men can be so impetuous, but then maturity has its moments, too. Shall we? - What's the matter, stud, you losing your touch? I understand them black pussies suck your fuck like wild-- (thuds) (groans) - Your move. - Put it away or I'll shove it up your ass and pull the trigger. - Don't be a dead hero. Like the girl said, nobody needs you around here. - I'll get you for this, you son of a bitch. - Next time you come around my shop, sucker, breakin' up things, pick on me, brother.

Can I come in for a minute? - Not now, Artie, later huh? - We must talk about this, Jonathan. - Okay, Artie. Look, I know I owe you an explanation. First of all, forget about the damage to the shop. It's been bought and paid for, with interest. And secondly, forget about Brenda. She's gone and she's exactly where she wants to be. - Brenda? Jonathan, you can't be serious. I know Brenda, she wouldn't do such a thing. - She did, Artie. I know 'cause I just left her. And she's happy as hell where she is. The only thing I'm really concerned about, is what they did to you. Are you okay? - That's alright, Jonathan. You mustn't worry about that, I'll be alright. (door knock) - [Richard] Can I come in? - You might as well. - Jonathan, I know you're upset about the condition of the salon, but don't worry about it. We can fix it up, I'm sure we can fix it. - Of course we can and it'll be nice as ever. - Oh, it'll be better than ever. - Of course. - Artie, I have a great idea. Why don't we invite Jonathan to the party? - Jonathan-- - No thanks. - Jon, it'd be so much fun! It's gay, and straight, and really wild. A western style barbecue. Won't you please come? It's just what you need to pick you up! (Jonathan chuckles) - A western style barbecue, to pick me up? - Yeah. - Might be a good idea. Okay. - Brenda! (melancholic piano music) Brenda! - [Brenda] Alright, I'm coming. - You look wonderful, like a beautiful black angel. Come over here. Here, let me do that. What's the matter, darling? You seem a million miles away. - No, nothing really. I'm sorry. - [Wilson] Is everything ready? - [Thug] Yes, sir. (slap) - Don't you ever look at any of my papers ever. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes, sir. (tense piano music) - I'm sorry I lost my temper, but don't you ever look at any of my papers or books again, do you hear me? - I won't, I promise. - That's a good little pussycat. I won't be around tonight. I got a fuckin' speech to make at some god damn dinner. Understand? - Yes, of course. (lively funk music) - Is your boss Mr. Jonathan coming? - We're not certain, he might. - I hope so. I'd love to get my hands on him. - Lay off, sweetie, Mr. Jonathan's as straight as a arrow. - Maybe I can bend him. - Not a chance. Just leave him alone. - Artie, I heard you were having trouble at the salon. And Mr. Jonathan needs a new receptionist, can I have a job? - He certainly does need a new receptionist, darling. Hoo! Mr. Jonathan would just love you. You've got the job, darling. - Oh, good good good! Oh god, she'll never drown, believe me. - [Friend] Well if it ain't Mr. Jonathan. Mr. Jonathan himself. - What's happenin', dude? - Alright. Well as they say, business is business. Come on, let me show you. - Naw, later man, I'll have to check you later. - How big is he, really? - Who? - Your boss Mr. Jonathan. - Oh, I wouldn't know. - Well if they don't know, I'll just find out and tell them. - Jonathan, it's so good to see you. I'm glad you decided to come to the barbecue. - Oh, it's just an old-fashioned cook-out. - It certainly is. - Yeah, I can see. Just an old-fashioned cook-out. - What's he afraid of? I don't bite. - Well what do you think, Mr. Jonathan? - I think that you need to have Artie and Richard take a good look at you tomorrow, my dear. - Well why don't you take the ends of that? - Darling, no no, you take it, you take it. - Jonathan, I'd like you to meet a very very beautiful girl. Come on here, Jackie. Jonathan. - Hello, Mr. Jonathan. - This is our new receptionist. Do you like her? - Wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful. - Jonathan! Jonathan? - Mr. Jonathan, my name is Ben.

I don't understand you, come on, have some fun. It's not like you, Jonathan. - Yeah, you're right. I tell you what. I'm goin' up to my cabin and hang out for a couple of days. Try to get my head together. You take care of the salon, huh? - Jonathan, that salon will be prettier and better than ever, Jonathan. I'll fix it right to the detail, every picture on the wall.
