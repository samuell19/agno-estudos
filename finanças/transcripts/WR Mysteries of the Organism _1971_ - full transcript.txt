Do not turn offthis pulsating motor of joy and life energy. Orgasmotherapy is the program ofSexpol... as taught by the revolutionary doctor and communist. Wilhelm Reich. [ Chorus. In Russian ] ? Communist Party ? ? My fragrant flower ? ? Communist Party ? ? My beloved? ? My fragrant flower ? ? Communist Party ? ? My beloved? ? My fragrant flower ?? [ Narrator] The bioelectric charge and discharge produced by the genital embrace... causes the orgasmic reflex - supremelypleasurable muscular contractions. Subjection to social disciplines may cause gastric ulcers... respiratory. coronary and vascular diseases. Comrade lovers. foryour health's sake. fuck freely. The communist movement fights for the liberation... ofman's natural impulses andjoy ofliving. 4. 000 liberating orgasms in every woman's and man's life... are 4. 000 explosions ofliberated life energy.

Cancer is the hysteria of cells condemned to death. Cancer and fascism are closely related. Fascism is the frenzy ofsexual cripples. The swastika owes its magnetism to being a symbol oftwo bodies locked in genital embrace. It all stems from a longing for love. Comrades. make love joyously and without fear. Let the current flow sweetly up your spine. Letyour hips roll andyour mouth water. Saliva is good. Embracing lovers radiate a bluish light: orgone illumination... the same sort oflight the astronauts saw in outer space. Let us reactivate the natural vibrations within ourselves and society. Let the current stream sweetly through your muscles. Feel free to tremble and cry. Letyourselfenjoyyour body. As revolutionaries whose revolution renounces love... we feel very uncomfortable. What's happening to the revolution? Each baby is a new approach to life. How can we help this new being to grow up free? The man who discovered orgone - cosmic energy. the energy oflife and love - fled from Hitler and Stalin to America. Iand ofthe free. He gave up the ideologies ofhis youth. eventually voting for Eisenhower. In Maine. he set up the orgone laboratory... a scientific research center. How can we rid ourplanet of its deadly clouds ofsmog? How can we make the deserts green and fruitful? [ Man Speaking English ] "'Hooray. 'he cried. 'I am a real boy!. ' "Look at me dance.

I'm here in the accumulator. -[ Man ] Canyou come out? - Shall we come out now, Paul?. 'Cause theywant to talk. Okay. Well, this is the accumulator. Not in a very, uh, dignified setting... but the air is fresh out here. And, uh, there are about - oh, I would say maybe not more than 1 0 or 1 5 ofthese now being used in the country. There were, at the height ofthe interest - and when Reich was still alive and before the injunction, there were about 300. Canyou explain to us an accumulatora little? - How it works?. - Yeah. Well -Yeah. It's - It's - It's actually - It's not, uh - It mystifies me in part because it is very simple. It's just, uh, organic material on the outside-organic material - and metal material on the inside. And it - it, uh - The organic thing operates like a nylon material... which collects what's called static electricity... orwhat Reich called orgone energy. [Narrator] The orgone accumulator. orgone shooterand orgone blanket... were used in the treatment ofailments due to a low energy level in the body... and. experimentally. in the treatment ofcancer. And he had a machine - which my finger was bleeding very bad - and he used this machine on my finger... and it stopped bleeding. Which is the cut right there. You can see the cut very plain. It stopped bleeding almost immediately. [Narrator] Insteadofputting his theories to a scientific test... the American authorities prosecuted Reich like a common criminal. [ Woman Speaking English ] His last words to the Supreme Court were... "The planet is i n trouble"... and I recommend that anybody who really wants to know read his suppressed... and secret evidence... in which, uh, he outlined his... stand judicially. And in spite ofthat, he wa - experienced a judicial murder... which resembles that which he outlined in his book The Murder ofChrist. And, uh, we have managed to make... a life here after his death. But I feel that, uh... the world went the wrong way... at the time ofhis death. 1 957. [ Narrator] He died. a free man to the end... in the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg. Pennsylvania.

[ Man ] In the evening. um... we were in the house. and we got a call from the Tropps... which was a family who lived about two blocks away... saying that there was a group ofpeople coming up the road... shouting "Down with the Orgies "... "Down with the commies. " "Down with the Orgies. " They called us "Orgies "because it was an abbreviation ofOrgonon and orgone. And they were very frightened. And they said they were coming down towards our house. And sure enough. in about five minutes. there was this group ofpeople outside... uh. shouting "Down with the Orgies " and "Down with the commies. " I was terrified. And I remember that Reich got his. 45 out - a. 45 automatic - and went out the back door. I think. And the leader ofthe group was a storekeeper - a local storekeeper. And he was just shouting for them to go away. And we were worried because he went away with them. We didn't know what had happened. And I remember driving down - this was at night - drivi ng down the mai n street of town - And I don't even know anymore if - if I saw this out of fear or if it really happened. I'm not sure anymore. But... I remember - I remember seeing Reich with a.45 at this man's back... just walking him down Main Street. Hello. I am Vance Oakes. And I run the Main Street Market with my brother here. It's an old-fashioned store. I've, uh -We've been here 52 years. And our father before us. And Dr. Reich used to come here and trade day after day. We knew him verywell. Here's my brother. - He'll tell you who I am. - Hello. I'm Carl Oakes. I'm in business with my brotherVance... for all theseyears, except for two or three when he was ahead of me. And, uh, we all knew Dr. Reich verywell. He used to come in our market... tell us to open up ourwindows, let the air in. Well. he was. uh. considered... unusual. People. uh. didn't understand him. Myname is Pete Darova. Deputy sheriffand barber here in Rangeley. I, uh, was Dr. Reich's barber... when he was here. And, uh... he, uh... had a peculiar way of having his hair cut, uh, and combed. He, uh, didn't want it combed like ordinary people - parted and down this way. He wanted it combed all upwards like this and - One time- I'll neverforget- therewas a man working for him... and at 7:00 in the morning he walked into my store. And he says, uh, "Vance, Dr. Reich is a communist." And I said, "What doyou mean??" "Well," he says, "I was eating my lunch... "and I looked up, and he was looking at a map. "And when he saw me looking at it, he moved it away. "And I tell ya. I'm thinking he's making maps ofthis country. But besides, he hasn't paid me for three weeks." [Laughs ] Which I thoughtprobablywas the reason. [ Narrator] "Are men from outerspace alreadyliving on the planet Earth? "On March 1 0. 1 956.. at 1 0: 00 at night... "this almost incredible idea came to me. "Am I really a spaceman? "Do I belong to a new race ofearthlings sired by beings from outer space... "who had intercourse with Earth women? "Are my children the first offspring ofan interplanetary race? "Is this thought in some way related to what is yet to happen in the future? "I claim the privilege ofasking these and similar questions... "without fear ofbeing imprisoned for it by any authority whatsoever. "I hate the irrational. "However. I believe that even the most flagrant irrationality... "must contain something ofrational truth. "There is nothing in this human world ofours that is not in some way right... however distorted it may be. " In the 1 950s. the Orgonon became an international center for sex economy research. Rumor called it a secretJewish organization... that was masturbating patients in orgone accumulators... experimenting on children kept in cages... and plotting to introduce work democracy. Federal agents. eager to observe sex scenes... Iurked in the bushes with their binoculars. Reich shot at them. [ Recording: Reich Speaking English ] I took my gun... and I saw a group marching... and clearly shouting. "Commies! Commies! Commies! Come out! Out with you! Orgie! Orgie! Orgie! Orgie! " And I stopped them right away. And I asked them. "Who has called here... 'Down with the commies ' or 'Out with the commies '?" And I saw then Anderson. the druggist. "I elected Eisenhower today. I'm for Eisenhower. Everybody here did. "Now that does not help Eisenhower. It does not help America. "I'm going to report it to the F.B.I. "I want to say nobody here is a communist. We are all fighting the communists. "That I have fought the communists... Iong before anybody in the U.nited States knew the commies - in 1 930. " [ Woman Breathing Heavily] - [ Man ] That's it.

Keep it rocking. And keep breathing. Very good. Keep it rocki ng. And whi le she's breathing, I listen to the sound of her breathing - - [ Heavy Breathing] - Good. Keep it going. Very good. That's it. And you can hear the air being sucked into the body spontaneously. [ Heavy Breathing Continues ] Now come up. Bringyourhead up. Now press on your feet. There's a lot ofholding in most people at the back ofthe neck... where their stubbornness and their spite... is located. And it's a holding against giving in... Ietting go to their feelings... Ietting theirfeelings take over. - Very good. - [ Breathing Heavily] Very good. Go. Okay. Let the crying come. - [ Sobbing ] - Go on. Keep - Keep - He would ask me to breathe, first of all. Breathe. [ Exhales ] "Your eyes -Your eyes are going off. Look at me." Look at him. "Your mouth. You're -Your smile. Let it go. Let - " And then - [ Shouts ] You know. Or, uh - And also pressing the chest down... and sobbing in a very short time. And really feeling these - And then, even in the sobbing, don't stop breathing. 'Cause everybody cries. I mean, it would be nothing to get somebody to cry. Any sadist could getyou to cry. But to cry and to feel the person pressing forward - "Keep the breathing. Don't stop the breathing. "Let it come through fully with a full sob. "Let it come. Don't stop. No. You're running away. "You're running away. Don't run. Don't run. Let it come. Let it come. Keep breathing. You're forcing the breathing. Let it come naturally." Ah, you get desperate. You get mad as hell at him. "Keep it -That's it. Get angry, but don't stop breathing." And finally - [ Sighs ] Go through the body... and to feel this - what he would call my urgency give way... and I would feel it give way... to this kind of peaceful... streaming in the body when the breathing came through fully. And to feel this current of energy... Ieading to a verywarm, strong sensation... particularly in the genitals. And it's not the same as just becoming excited sexually. Though it was related to that. But it was a feeling offullness and pleasure... and not empty feeling thatyou're just living in your head. No! - No! - [Dr. Lowen ] Raise the head. No! No! No! [Dr. Lowen ] The movement is caught... about at this level. And bybreathing in and out... the - the tortuous "S" movement of the body... you know. is trying to establish itself. Breathe out. Breathe out. - [ Exhales ] - Sigh. Go ahead. As you breathe out. - [ Sighs ] - [ Sighs ] That's it. Go ahead. Sigh. - [ Sighing ] - Keep the chest lower. [ Sighing Continues ] All right. Enough of this movement. Enough of this movement. Put the - Put the knees up. Get a hold ofthem. That's right. Breathe. - That's it. Let the whole bodygo into it. - [ Man ] That's the way. [ Dr. Lowen ] That's it. That's it. That's it. Let it - Rest down on the heels. That's it. - Sigh. Sigh. Go ahead. Sigh. - [ Sighs ] - Loosen thejaw. - [ Sighs ] That's it. - [ Dr. Lowen ] How doyou feel? - [ Woman ] I feel very bright... and muchyounger and more alive. Andjust very - very soft. And very much aware of everything that's around me and very - Iike, really not frightened. I remember the feeling I had when I first asked a friend of mine... "Would you come and masturbate for me in the studio so I can draw it??" And it's like, "Oh, wow." That -That kind ofthing - You know, you don't -you don't do that. It's okay to - to make out with a partner... but the masturbation thing seems to be so personal. Every one ofthese people said after the experience that they felt very good about it... and they felt very liberated. It was ajoyful thing forthem. Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! It's mine! Mine! Give it to me! Give it to me! Ifanysane man orwoman... would be produced by a doctor suddenly... what would be the consequences?. Well, this is very simple.

Ofthe eyes can be cut out, blank, like in schizophrenia or in a schizoid person. Withdrawn. See?. You don't see them. They don't reach out toyou. Then we look at every other aspect ofthe body - the mouth, the jaw. For example, you have people with their tight, hard, determined jaws. And then the jaws that are withdrawn, as if a person hasn't got a right to assert himself. You know. Talks like this. You see?. And then the tight mouths. Or has he got the exaggerated manliness... ofthe West Point position with the inflated chest... and the held-in belly, you know, and the hard expression?. Or is his chest collapsed, you see?. And then is he afraid to let his belly out?. Does he have to hold his belly in to control his feelings?. Or can he afford to let himselfbe loose?. And does he tuck his ass in like a dog with his tail tucked between his legs like this?. You see?. Or is it too far backward like that?. Each ofthese tells us about the person.

We hardly know what personal happiness is, never mind the people's or the country's. We Russians do respectyour efforts to find your own way. You're a proud and independent people. But we are confident that you will learn from your own experience that ourway is best. Time will tell who'll win out. "Your closest kin will doyou in." Excuse me. That is a photo montage, isn't it?. No, it's authentic. Itwas photographed bythe Nazi HugoJaeger in 1 939. ??[European Folk Waltz] There was a fluid in the air, Jaeger said. ??[ Continues ] And then something monstrous began to happen. Thousands of men and women suddenly started trembling... and weeping. He simply... sat there... and looked at them. ??[ Continues ] I'm sorry, but I don't understand. Why doyou keep... - this hideous photograph?. - ??[Stops ] Look at those women. Those stupid cows, those slaves! They love, honor and obey authority. They endow authority with the primordial power of sex. Thanks to them, this inhuman, this bestial force can be made to seem... - humane. - ??[Resumes ] With their blind allegiance, their irrationality, women espouse every ideological delusion on earth. I admireyour passion but consider it unwarranted. After all, we're communists. Oh. [Milena ] Who areyou really? What tasks do ouryouth associations have? We call ourselves communists. Why?. What is a communist?. "Communist" is a Latin word. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. The eye and mind of every communist must be keen as a scalpel, his everyword sharp as a saber or ice skate, his every action precise as a razor cut. "Communist" implies "communal." A communist society means that everything is in common - the land, factories, labor. - ??[Ends ] - Mm-hmm. Will you have some cookies?. Everything is in common. There! That's communism! [ In English ] Mama. [Dr. Lowen ] You have to take it. Take it-[Indistinct] - Mama. - That's it. That's it. Take it toyou. That's it. Good. [ In Serbo-Croatian ] His name is World Revolution. He died in a US jail, convinced that Moscow agents had put him there. How can you say such things so lightly?. What I wonder is whether theywere the same people who went to Mexico and drove a pickax into the skull ofTrotsky, comrade-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin. - [ Breathing Heavily] - [ In English ] Make a sound. Come on. [ Shouting ] [ Screaming ] [ In Serbo-Croatian ] A man has to be sure ofsomething. Yes. For example, who one's father is, orwho the people are who rule over us. I'm a romantic. I claim there's no real revolution without free love. I understand. Kollontai's theory: The revolution must destroy marriage. Yes, bourgeois marriage is nothing but licensed prostitution. - ??[ U.p-tempo Polka ] - Radmilovic! You drunken pig! Let go! Get out! No trespassing allowed! - Beat it! - ??[Stops ] He teaches that every nice person Iike you and me hides behind his facade a great explosive charge, a great reservoir of energy that can be released only bywar or revolution. In me?. Me too?. Love and crime. Give me some. I'm charmed byyour enthusiasm, so excuse me ifI'm a bit ironic, but doesn'tyour - - I mean, his theory - - [Tapping] turn Trotsky's concept ofpermanent revolution into one - God forbid! - of permanent orgasm?. - [ Gasps ] - [ Giggles ] Here comes veteran shockworker Radmilovic! ??[ U.p-tempo Polka ] My apologetics!

Free the People's Artist! Screw the People's Artist! What areyou doing?. - ?? [ Vocalizing ] - He's a champion and a communist! [Jagoda Giggling] I want to screwyou.

Ah. they fuck faster than we can kill 'em. Fucking black niggas! What the hell do they want? [ T oy: Machi ne Gun Fi re ] [ Man ] This paper is so patriotic. it frightens the shit out ofmost people... 'cause it's the freest. most controversial. most honest publication ofthe last 50years. And a lot ofpeople give lip service to freedom... but when they see it right in front ofthem... they suddenly become authoritarian and afraid offreedom. Screw, which offends everybody. Catholic.Jew. Protestant. black. white. So this paper is patriotic 'cause it's the very essence... ofwhat America was supposed to be in 1 776. and is not. So, there we were i n front of the fireplace... and making love... which was new to me - to make love to a man. And there was a man making love to me. And I felt - I felt like - I felt very feminine because he was very masculine. Then we went from the couch, which was in front ofthe fireplace... and we dried - the rain dried from the warmth ofthe fire. And that was very sexy. We went to the bed. And I would not let him - I wouldn't let him fuck me. And I wouldn't go - I wouldn't - I wouldn't go down on him, 'cause this was my first time in bed with a man... who was taller than me, hairier than me. Oh, and so handsome. And he knew everything hewas doing. Sowhat did he do?. Hewent down on me. And I came immediately. Andit was so- to him. it was so fantastic... that he wanted myphone number... and I would not give it to him as I was getting dressed. And this was an action that was to be repeated later on... in my other briefaffairs with strangers - that I would not give them my number... because I was afraid. But didn't I go to his apartment every night and ring his bell at 3: 00 in the morning... stand outside his windowyelling his name... and never had any success or any luck? I didn't see him foryears. And the next time I saw him. I was a girl. And he couldn't get ready. Still turned on. but he was. Iike. into sleeping with boys... which was sort of. uh. very limited... when he had all the equipment. I mean. since I was the same person. I mean. Iiterally the same person. That's the girl I was tellingyou about. Isn't she fantastic? 'Cause I would wear the glitter on my lips - the red glitter on - The glitter on the eyes, the glitter in the hair... and it would be, like, really - I mean, unreal. You just don't see things like that, you know. Just likeyou don't see things like that. Like this. - [Man Laughs ] - I mean, you don't see things like this all the time. [ In Serbo-Croatian ] Death to male fascism! Freedom to female people! [ In English ] Nowyou can takeyour pants off. I really do feel like I'm - [ Indistinct ] Like putting on the right music now. ?? [ Hums ] [Man] ?I'm gonna kill myself? ?Overyour deadbody? ?Ifyou fuck anybodybut me ? ? You maythink? ?I'm being kind ofshoddy? ? But that's the wayit's gotta be ? ? I'm gonna kill myself? ? Overyour dead body? ? Ifyou fuck anybody but me ?? [ Nancy] Whileyou're lying there. I'd like you to close your eyes... and I'd like you to think that this is a sexual experience - that we're making love - or anything you want to. anything that turns you on. Just relax and use your imagination. Don't necessarily think ofthe reality ofwhat's happening... but think ofwhat you'd like to be happening. - [Jim Chuckles ] - Andyou'll get along fine. ?? [ Orchestra: Classical ] ?? [ Orchestra: March ] [ I n Serbo-Croatian ] I t is utter nonsense to talk about a free people's state. For a time, the proletariat needs the state, not in the interest of freedom, but in order to subdue its enemies. And when it has become possible to really speak offreedom, the state as such will have ceased to exist. ??[Rock] - ? Kill. kill. kill forpeace ? - [ Machine Gun Fire ] ? Kill. kill. kill forpeace ? ?

A man can't fritter his life away aimlessly. He must be committed and aim at a single target, like a spear, shoot at it like an arrow. Watch out! Mywork demands all of me. One can't live halfway. To die for love is dishonorable, selfish, bourgeois. It's brutishly zoological. - I like being here. - [ Chuckles ] I confess that there's much I don't understand, butyour people are wonderful. Including the women?. That man slammed his head through a wall foryou. I couldn't care less. ??[Russian Ballad] The air is as fresh as music. Nothing is lovelier than the Appassionata. I could listen to it all day. Marvelous, superhuman music. With perhaps naive pride, I think, "What wonders men can create!" But I can't listen to music. It gets on my nerves! It arouses a yearning in me to babble sweet nothings, to caress people living in this hell who can still create such beauty. - ??[Stops ] - But nowadays, ifyou stroke anybody's head, he'll biteyour hand off!.

[ Whimpers ] Forgive me. You love all mankind, yetyou're incapable ofloving one individual, one single living creature. What is this love that makes you nearly knock my head off?. You said I was as lovely as the revolution. Butyou couldn't bear the "Revolution" touching you! What's a baby to a male?. A matter of a second! Everything else is the woman's job! Meanwhile, you placeyour body at the service of art! Your magic, flood-lit figure serves the needs ofthe masses! A bunch oflies is whatyou're serving the people and the party! A toy balloon is what it is - not a revolution! A petty human lie dressed up as a great historical truth! Areyou capable, you rotten louse, of serving the needs ofthe species by taking the one basic position for an ecstatic flight to the target Iike an arrow or a vigorously hurled spear?.

[ Milena Gasps ] [ I n Serbo-Croatian ] What's in the hopper today?. This was 200 yards upstream from where the body was found. Cute kid. Such a pretty head. Chopped offby something very sharp - an ax or cleaver. The blow must have been very severe. For this pretty head to lose its neck required a strong stroke. Hervagina contained a huge amount of sperm - three or four times the usual. Any clues at the scene?. Could it have been group sex?. Based on the evidence, I doubt she was gang-banged or even raped. It was more likely a wild night oflove. No sign of a struggle. Therefore she received the semen willingly. Yes. Better checkwith mental hospitals in case some sex-starved patient has escaped. Was the murderweapon found?. Yes, these nickel-plated Champions. They're the finest made. Cosmic rays streamed through our coupled bodies. We pulsated to the vibrations ofthe universe. But he couldn't bear it. He had to go one step further. Vladimir is a man of noble impetuousness... a man of great ambition... and immense energy. He's romantic, ascetic, a genuine Red Fascist. Comrades... even now I'm not ashamed of my communist past. ??[ Guitar: Ballad] [ In Russian ] ? Before the Earth stops turning ? ? Before the lights grow dim ? ?To each one, Lord, I pray thee ? ?
