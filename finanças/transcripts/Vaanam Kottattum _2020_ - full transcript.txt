Hey Selva, come here - What happened? - I said nothing happened Oh no! Can you please tell me what happened? Come on, Mangai climb up. - Pray to the deity. - Almighty... ...will you take good care of our children? What happened? Your shirt is full of blood stains The opposite party attacked my brother They didn't want my brother to win the elections. What happened to Brother-in-law? He survived. I got him admitted at the hospital But-- the guys I attacked, might not make it alive. Hey, stop crying it's temporary. I'll be out of the prison in no time. My party will bail me out. Listen, instead of crying... ...try and make my mother understand. Selva, you will have to take care of your mother and sister. Don't be playful all the time. Dad, will come back as soon as possible. "I'm shattered by my dear son's loss" "He was the life of this village" "My dear you've lost your beloved husband" "Our dearest has left us in despair" Please listen to what I have to say Hey, what's happening? Hear me out - Step aside - Where are you taking him? - Where are you taking him? - Partner! Sir, let go of him. How can you do this?

[Overlapping Chatter] Don't you understand? Don't speak nonsense. Did you come here to show me your long face? Let me know what's been happening? It's been long since I heard your voice. I can manage without money, house or a job but I'm not sure how to manage everything without a husband. I'm not able to go out for social gatherings, nor I can go out to buy anything It's become hard to move around the neighborhood. The entire town is shaming us. Stop whining about it. I'm not the first person to be imprisoned When they knew about their defeat in election rightfully they should've backed off They shouldn’t have resorted to violence Obviously when my brother got attacked, I had to retaliate Listen carefully, we can't let go of our anger or ego We'll always follow the steps of our ancestors So will be my kids too Enough! Just 'cause you couldn't control your anger, I don't want our kids to suffer. Eh-- don't exaggerate now You'll be taken care of, once Velusamy brother is back from the hospital. I beg of you... ...It's enough that your brother brought this on you. I'm gonna leave this town with my kids I'll make do somewhere else. Where will you go? Have you gone mad? How can you leave everything behind? I don't care! I'm just going far from here. "Darling. Love. Princess" "just the sight of you... What's wrong with you? Why are you leaving with the kids? If I stay back, then he'll do the same as his father I had enough. Spare me from it. How dare you? How can you take away my grand kids. You couldn't raise your sons grow up to be sane... ...I can't do the same to my children Spare us, we're going far from here. Go and sit there. - "Trust me on this Kids, don't worry about anything -"'O' my dear I'll come and meet you guys in Chennai - "if your name isn't mentioned ...monsoons go dry" "Darling. Love. Princess" "just the sight of you makes my heart burn with desire" "Trust me on this 'O' my dear" - How are you sister? "if your name isn't mentioned, monsoons go dry "-I'm good "Your beauty is nothing less than a gleam off the full moon" "Speak to me with love 'O' dear..." Rowther, this the person for whom I wanted a job - She's from my town - Vanakkam, Ma! Father is not living with them. Moreover he's in the prison for murder... ...how do you expect me to take him in? My son is studying in this same school. Please understand and make an exception. "A speck of anger in your eyes..." He's my only son, Ramachandran. When we got here first, everything seemed new to us but now I'm used to it. Thanks! - Uncle! - Hey, Selvam Uncle! - Mangai! - Mangai, my sweetheart - Please come inside - Come in, mother. The manager is calling you inside. Bose, they won the election with sympathy votes stating double murder. Neither our relatives nor our friends vote for us. I've been trying hard to bail you out. They're just giving false hopes Nothing seems to be working out. "You're my strength and guardian" "no matter what anyone says, you’re my better half" "Love, I've been waiting for your return" Hey, Selva. Let go of him Let it go. If mom knows about it, she'll kill you. Hey, then don't bother telling her Ey-- what the hell are you doing?

I came down to Koyembedu to collect some cash Where's Selva? Oh him? He's a freedom fighter right? So he's been locked up at the Police station for beating up a guy. Police Station? Where else? I thought moving away would be good for them But my ill fate, I'm still making rounds to the Police station Let him rot out there. I did warn your father not to get married but to stay single and be happy like me He never listened It was you who got him married to keep the family tree growing Now see what you've done Don't keep blaming me for everything First, you go and get him! Take this. Police stations are not new to me Come on, let's go. Have your meal and then go - You can finish it instead - Hey...! If it was the Police station from our place, I would've got you out in a jiffy the Police officers here are too arrogant. Hey Selva, please for God sake stay calm and don't get into fights. Selva and Mangai, this is the Koyembedu Plantain Market. It's fortune as good as Tirupathi's donation bank people make millions out here. If you go wrong with accounts, I'll beat you to pulp - Paramasivam! - Welcome, Boss! You guys go and load the stock. You've arrived with no notice You never answered my calls for past 2 days. It's not easy to run a business at Koyembedu There are one too many issues to be resolved. Please sit down. Are they your children? They're my brother's. Oh your brother who is in Madurai's prison Hey Augustine, get me 3 teas So, tell me boss, who's your new vendor? You refused to take it further, so I'm trading locally at Theni. I just came to visit my family and also to settle the accounts. Accounts? What are you talking about? I listed down everything during the last consignment and settled the account. There's a pending balance of 80,000 rupees Boss, our previous deal incurred me a loss of 2 Lacs If I take the rotten bananas into account, it'll add up to a truck's load As this was our first deal I didn't want to burn bridges that's why I listed everything and settled the account. It's not fair that you're here asking for another 80,000 rupees. Look here Paramasivam, I don't like foul play In spite of my partners warning me, I took the risk of doing business outside Theni. Don’t try to be over smart. I'm particular about the accounts. Make the payment of 80,000. Boss, this is not your village, you can't talk to me like that We follow our own technique down here Listen, I'm being calm, 'cause it's your hood If it was my village, you would've lost your hands and legs Fine, you can do it when I'm over there Now, please get out. Hey Augustine, cancel the Teas. Hey! Can't you fix the vehicle? Start the bloody vehicle Oi, why the hell are you following me? Ey-- Ey-- what happened? He punched me in the face - Who? - That's him, look he's coming Hey, hey, who the hell are you? Hey, hey, hey...what the hell are you doing? Hey...hey... Hey, how dare you...? Sit down, damn it!

Just one drink dear, it'll help me sleep through the journey can't stay awake for 10 straight hours That's how it is. That's it. C'mon, let's go. Come on. Don't you know I was leaving town? Where were you all this while? Paramasivam, had a change of heart. Returned it with interest. Count it. I didn't count. How the hell did you managed to take this from him? You nailed it! Don't worry, we'll talk to her Chandra...Chandra! Don't you call me by my name. I'll whack you right on the street My dear mother, we came down to get an opinion from you Please don't curse us - Something's fishy, sister - Velumani, auntie Read my hand and let me know if I'll be a successful businessman? It reads, that you're a hooligan You're absolutely right He's a hooligan Our idea is to change that course of his fate Mom, you just have to say yes to it What happens when I say, yes? Instead of hunting for a job also he'll stop renting car from Kathir uncle Then what else? I'm going to start a business Business? And that too, you? - Yes - That's a good joke Ma! Your daughter is a smart advocate I'll take care of it. Firstly, you pass your exams. Oi Chandra, stop right there! Better say, YES! Fine, Yes! Mom, it's not enough that you said "Yes" help us get some funds from Rowther Uncle. - You heard them right? - We can start our business They're trying to destroy me now Get me as a loan, I'll return it with interest Chandra sister, didn't you come down to start a new life? Why are you stopping them, when they're about to start something new? You're asking me to trust them on this? They'll drag me down like a dead weight. Uncle! Uncle! Wake up! Hey-- how come you guys are already here? Uncle, we came down to discuss something important. What's so important? Did you find a suitable match for your sister? Uncle, first listen to everything what we have to say Fine, tell me We're planning to start the Plantain business at Koyembedu I thought you were smart kids but you guys sound like the dumb ones. What do you guys even know about Plantains? Agreed, we don't know anything about Plantains. How many varieties? how to check quality? It's business or how much it yields? We have no idea about it. But I'm sure this is my business I'll learn I may be rusty in the beginning. But will work my way up. - Here, hold this. - Hold it. Welcome! Surprised to see you here. What's the matter? Rajendran, your partner attacked me and my brother attacked your partner We've been living our lives full of grudges I think, it's enough My nephew and niece are here to do business You're the only successful businessman in this area Give us 30,000 plantains a year you'll make a profit and as well as they'll make some money. What do you expect me to say? That's my partner's son. What do I tell him? Chinnaiya! Our grudge is with their father, not with them. "You're the king of this deserted forest" "If you meet the God, ask him about it" "I flipped the coin and bent over to see how it landed" "I tried to buy him out, but there's been no response" "Oh my God, Oh my God, please talk to me" "Please point us to a heart which bears no worries" "On an unfortunate night, I got destroyed a bit" "also cursed myself asking, Why was I born?" "but later I saw a ray of hope" "Got a clarity and my heart got fired up" "When I started looking for unanswered questions" "a path which I never wanted to pursue, opened up" "Show me the right direction so that I can go head on" "Roll the dice and see if it lands on a hard number" "You're the king of this deserted forest" "It doesn't matter whom it belongs to" "without a perspective, you can't find answers" "Take small steps to achieve success" "The end and beginning are two faces of a song" Fool, are those 10's and 500's? Uh? When you can't why do you bother? Why are you indulging in it? Ey-- don't fight you guys! As if you're a genius? -Wonder how they got you to study law? "Come on! Listen to a fantastic idea" Come on kids, let's have lunch This is for your hard work with farming and this is the profit from our business. Fine, either ways I'm going to save up for you kids. Bose, don't waste a lot of water the lands have gone dry. Brother Bose... There's still time for the visiting hours Doesn't matter, anyways I'm not such a busy person Hey buddy, how are you? Chandra! Chandra! I thought you didn't come For a moment, my world was in darkness. I thought God once again disappointed me, but you're here now. You never used to be so sweet when we were together. Now that you're behind bars, your love is shining on me. - Hope the kids are doing good? - They're doing good and have grown up to be wise people. You could've brought them along. It's been ages, since I've seen them. They don't like to visit their father in the prison? Am I right? Fine, forget about that How are you managing things? You look younger than our previous meet. How's that even possible? Look, half my hair has turned Grey It's all 'cause of our children they literally made my life difficult But everything is good now Our son took me to a Bank and opened an account for me He deposited 25,000 rupees Also asked to quit my job. I said no to him. Why should I quit my job? I was never dependent on them. Ah...ah...tell me more They've started plantain business they've been working hard day and night. Our daughter goes to college during the day and to the market in the evening to help out her brother. The time is running out try and tell me everything you can that'll be my only solace until we meet next. It's time, please come out. Come on, come out. Please go. Come on get out.

To put it in one word, "Loss". Court case, Bank loan default Strike! 60 years ago when Britishers left India, my Grandad Cyril Thomas bought mills from them they were huge Cotton mills. But my father destroyed everything Club, Drinks and Women on top of it, enmity with everyone Even my father was a clubbing freak. Then it was me, I lost everything. Dad-- Is this the time?

She should've born as my daughter Let me know once you get a shop at Koyembedu the first load will be from Andhra. Thanks Garu! Do you know how hard is it to get a shop at Koyembedu? As if you're a successful cinema heroine 'cause your one smile will make the CMDA officer melt and sign the papers. I've inquired, heard he's an honest officer but please don't break his nose. Hey-- stop ranting nonsense. Just pray to a God or Satan so that we'll get the shop. Go!

Two thousand? 2 Lacs? - Two crores -Two crores? TWO CRORES?! Two crores? Two crores? - What's happening out here? - Now that you're here... You take care of things now, I can't handle it anymore. I'm not expecting as cash, just as a bank guarantee. Two Crores is it? Yes. If I don't get it, everything will be auctioned. To get the Bank manager to agree on 2 Crores, I literally had to flirt with him You're a fast growing businessman at the moment Whenever you rich people want something, that is when you will flash your smiles. I'm in a situation where nothing will offend me Can you help me? I'll think about it. Two crores, it seems It's better we remain as middle class people. Sir! Sir!

Hey, why aren't you guys cutting down the crops? Only if you get it done by 5pm, it'll reach Koyembedu on time. Thevar, the owner of the farm asked us not to cut it down - Rajendran uh? - Yes. Rajendra, what happened? Why are you stopping them? It won't work out, uncle. Let's settle the account. Settle the accounts? Didn't we agree on 30,000 plantain? And you're asking to settle the account I heard Bose is out of the prison Agreed that you didn't want to mix enmity and business back then Bose was in the prison and I agreed. Now that he's out of the prison this won't work out, uncle. Let's not proceed. Let's settle the account and part our ways. Don't be upset that the load didn't arrive from your village let's take this as a positive sign - It's monsoon and the crops will get spoiled - Hello, Bose Kalai speaking What does he think of himself? Look here-- --doesn't matter, if they're refusing to send him the stock I know how to get the stock for my son. Ya, let him know about it. That's not how business is done Won't send in the stock it seems. Selva, did you happen to see your father? I didn't see him at the market today. He left in the morning, hasn't returned yet. Not sure, if he knows his way back here. Selva, did Dad mention about going anywhere? Selva, first ask where is her jewelery? I never saw him today She gave him all of her jewelry Did he inform anyone at the market? Mom! All your rage is out only on us but in front of your husband, you're a kitten. You gave him all your jewelry once he asked for it he must've sold them don't worry, he'll be back once he runs out of the money. I'll break your bones don't you dare accuse my son. What do you really know about my son? Mom! Where are you going? Stop right there. Ey-- it's my husband who's been missing My children are not going to bother, looking for him I'll go to the Police station and see what I can do - Let go off my hand - Mom, you're overreacting - Let go off my hand - Mom! You stay back, I'll look for him. Where were you since yesterday? We were looking for you everywhere. Mom and granny are relentless without sleep. I'm here now, right? Show your brother the stock I brought in Mom-- he's back. He's right here. Mom wants to talk to you. Hello, where will I go? Don't start screaming now Brother said load won't be coming in, so I went to Bangalore I'll explain when I meet you, hang up now. Ya. Take this. Go and take a look. You can't recognize the fruit right? Look closer, it's the same plantain Nothing much, they cut them down in batches and have been ripened inside a air conditioned room. My boys took me to Bangalore. It's called Golden Fruits it seems. They're turning the plantains into ripe fruit and making money We'll be the first in this city to do so. Please don't take me wrong he got fruits which will get spoiled in a day and that too loads of it. What do we do about it? We're not running a street retail business we're wholesale retailers in the market. If someone looks at it, they'll mock us. How do we explain this fruit and sell them? Mom's jewelry is going to rot forever Giveaway the fruits to our customers in the market Tell them it's a gift Let's not leave them to rot. If I knew you'd be coming over, would've prepared meat for you people In jail, the three of us used to eat together all the time. In these 10 years, whenever brother comes to know there isn't enough food he used to share his food with all of us. Brother, come on feed him. Guys don't embarrass me Are you feeling awkward 'cause sister is here? - You don't have to be... - Change up and join us for dinner Were you able to sell all the fruits? How much did you make of it? Hey, hey, hey...Selva stop. I have to dump them all in the sewer Did I ever ask him for his help? Over enthused! I gave away the entire load for free He should either stay at home or should've returned to the Village. Shouldn't be messing up our lives like this. How dare you? How dare you speak to him like that? Ey-- instead of talking to your mother Be a man and talk to my face I don't have any issues talking to your face. Now listen-- --you can stay if you won't interfere with my business If not, are you asking me to get out of the house? Listen... C'mon tell me, are you asking me to get out of the house? I'm asking you not to interfere with my business Ey-- save your tactics for the business don't try and use them on me. If you're going to be interfering with our lives, we don't need you. It's better you return to the Village Ey-- what's wrong with you? - Chandra! - How dare you say that? Hold on! He's been ranting nonsense and you've been leading him on I asked you to stay calm, dammit! Brother! Are you a fool? I clearly explained it to you Bose, please don't do it. Please don't Bose, listen to your mother - Bose! - Dear, what's wrong with you now? He's being childish and you're taking it seriously I thought of taking you along with me We have a daughter, so please take care of her. Please listen... Bose, where are you going? Take me with you. Dear... "no matter what anyone says, you’re my better half" Dear! "Love, I've been waiting for your return" "Don't mind anymore, take me along ashore" "You're my shoulder to lean on, when I'm lonely" "Give me some space in your heart and lap to rest for a while" Are you leaving 'cause you were hurt from the fight last night? Don't you like to live with us anymore? Your son is short tempered just like mine But I'm sure, he's a good soul I have two sons the eldest never got married and lived his life But Bose, in spite of having a family couldn't live with them Anyways, with God's grace-- --I was expecting everything will fall into place Wonder who cast an evil eye on our family? Once I reach our village, I'm gonna offer sacrifice for Deity Karuppusamy I took an oath when Bose went to the prison may be the Deity is angry for not keeping my word. May be that's why this is happening. Sir, this is my brother. He ran away from Tirupur and is now in Madras can you please help me find him? Chennai is a hugely populated city-- --how do you expect me to find him? It's better you consult an astrologer, he'll find him for you. Get lost. Sir the problem is, he's a little mentally disturbed. Before something bad happens it's better we find him. Brother, please come over here. Mom, Mom, Mom... Why are you so bloody angry with me? You won't speak to me nor will look at me? For a moment, think from my perspective Trust is very important in a business If they don't trust me, I won't have return customers That's it, business will be ruined. Mom, the truck load of stock he got us-- --was a huge loss, as we couldn't sell it. What is it dear? How are you? And how's business? The machines are running, I'm sailing through Any update on the whereabouts of your father? I think he's way far off overseas not able to find him. How are you managing things? Factory, Business, Loan sharks... I'm trying my best to be strong like you. You're my inspiration. - Selva... - Aunty! I didn't come to meet Selva. I came to meet his father and I have something for him I went to your house, as no one was there, I came over here. I've paid half of the guaranteed amount, Selva had signed for I want to inform the same to Bose uncle I want to tell him that I don't know how to flirt or cheat his son. Him? When did you meet him? He's not in Chennai. He returned to the Village yesterday. He had come over to the Factory this morning Today? He insulted me in front my entire staff accused me of luring you to borrow money What he said was not entirely wrong though half of it may be true. I'll make sure to clear the debt so that you won't be in any kind of problem please inform him the same. Selva-- --I won't disturb you anymore. If he didn't return to the Village. Where is he now? Listen, don't be thinking too much about the issues at home try to move on, only then, you'll find a solution. Ey-- master of advice I was bugged with your ranting, that's why I agreed to come to the movies Go! Come on, let's go. Oi! - Hey...! - Bunked college is it? How can I not, when Mangai asks me out for a movie? Did you hear that Ram? This rich dude will do anything for me. Listen, if you sleep off again during the movie I'll definitely kill you. You keep blaming me for it Why do you bring me to English Dramas? There will be subtitles Ram, look at them. So, do you want me to watch the movie or read the subtitles? - It's a lame logic bro - Correct! Only you can reply to her nonsensical questions. Ey-- get lost and shut up Excuse me. Ssshh! Excuse me. Ssshh! Excuse me. Ssshh! Hello? Who's that? Dad?! This is the first time, you've called me Dad. Son, please come. We need to talk. Not to worry, please come. You sit down. Please come. Uncle! Son, we have great respect for your family. Please don't spoil it. Uncle, I think you've misunderstood. It's not wrong to go out for movies or ride together on a bike. Agreed that you're a good kid. That's why you invited Ram as well. But I'm not a fool to believe everything I'm sure where these things will lead to Kalyan, you're not obligated to speak to him Mangai, please be patient. Let him talk. Son, what would've your father said if he was in my situation? He would've definitely said it's wrong. Not you, but would've blamed my daughter It's 'cause you own a farm you're filthy rich. We elders know what's right for our children Please don't rush into things. - I beg of you - Uncle... You're calling me uncle, right? Then listen to what I have to say I'm a villager, and quite egoistic I've been in prison for years Please don't put me back in there. Uncle, I'm confused if this is an advice or a threat? It's up to you to make that decision. Tell me Annachi You're well aware of the market's situation everything is going good. Please tell me. Golden Fruits is it? They were from Bangalore Keep talking. Yes, I got them as sample to test You're right, Karnataka is filled with them. Yes, that's why I had sent my father to pick up a stock of samples Selva! Tell me what's the matter? Our father will never change, he's going to destroy us. - You just wait and see - What?! 200 boxes for Pazhamudhir Chozai? For just one customer, I can't even afford the transportation charges You were right about him we were at peace when he used to be in prison. Why don't you speak to Nilgiris as well? I can do it if two customers places the order Selva, what does he really thinks of himself? Sir, even if the profit is less, there'll be no loss. He literally insulted me in front of everyone. As if I committed a crime. What did I do wrong? Was it him or it was me? He committed a crime and went to the prison But he's accusing me of doing something wrong Look, I don't want him to be controlling me - I've said it - Sure, we can do it Today is Friday we'll start delivering from Monday - Ok, Sir. - I'm talking to you, but you're not bothered. Selva, you just come and speak to him about it. Come and support me as a brother. 2400 boxes, the Bengaluru fruits are in demand the boxes of fruits we thought was useless are in demand now. Now think, how to make this a big hit. Selva, this is my life Put your life on hold I'll speak to the guys at Bengaluru. Ey-- don't leave me hanging with a problem Hold on, I'm coming too. "This that hunnid dolla bill; that’s on my mind that's how I’m feeling" "That’s what I’m feeling. I’m in the building, talking my shot" "Walk and I get it. Imma go get it and pass to my kids" "Yeah!" "Hunnid rims. Hunnid goons. Hunnid mill." "When you're in trouble, you know what's the deal" "It'll be blazing, shot is a film" "Homie, let it rain money" "And I’m breaking the bank for my Family" "the money too Long not an issue anymore" "Hit it!" "This that hunnid dolla bill; that’s on my mind that's how I’m feeling" "That’s what I’m feeling. I’m in the building, talking my shot" "Walk and I get it. Imma go get it and pass to my kids" "Yeah!" "Hunnid rims. Hunnid goons. Hunnid mill." "When you're in trouble, you know what's the deal" "It'll be blazing, shot is a film" "Homie, let it rain money" "And I’m breaking the bank for my Family" "the money too Long not an issue anymore" This looks like Laila-Majnu's love story You leave from here. I was able to bear it for 20 years, but in these two days, you made me cry a lot. Why should you cry? What else do you expect? Then, I have to be angry with God. You'll do things which you feel is right, and the kids do the same what they feel like. But I'm stuck in between you guys. You take your bike and come back home. I can't do that, I have a lot of work to do. What job? As if you're a Collector. They asked me to get out of the house I won't return, until they come looking for me. But I'll come over here. I'll come and spend time with you. Ey! Listen carefully-- --Mom has been calling out your name relentlessly She doesn't think of anything else. I've come down to take you home. There's no time for revenge now Let's make do and move on with our lives. If you don't forget about it-- --you can never be at peace in your life. Do you understand, what I'm saying? I'll head home and cook something for him Mom-- Mom, don't leave me alone over here Dad! Dad! Yes, I went to a movie yesterday it was average.
