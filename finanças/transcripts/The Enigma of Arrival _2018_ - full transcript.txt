I take a bath in hot springs every time I go back home. This time, it is a bit different. An old friend, Fang Yuan, said that he'd found something unusual. And he summoned us together. It's not a bad idea. We haven't seen each other for ages. Sometimes things are clouded. What's visible to the eye is possibly not the truth. For example, smog is in fact gray, but it looks pale white. The British physicist Lord Kelvin once said: "When fire gives off light, "it will take on various colors. "Sometimes, "I believe fire should be black. "But when it turns darker, "the river "turns red." My first name has a "bo". My buddies thus broke down that character and called me "San Pi". I hated it. So from time to time, I didn't want to fool around with them. On that day, Da Si didn't show up. Where's Da Si? I'll check out. You're such a hypocrite. Zhao Xiaolong is being a pain in the ass again. He insisted that Da Si come here, so we can straighten things out. Life is floating between fiction and reality, like a prism which can create fiction and reality tinted by different colors. Everyone filters down memory to his own benefit. We got to know each other at Wuhu School of Marine Engineering. We didn't sit in class. Just fooling around by the river. Come on, look at you! Come over! Let me take you to a dance. Spot me some money? Who are you? This must be silver How about going dancing with me? Shit! Da Si. I'll go and get someone. Come closer. Or you don't have the balls? It's smuggled, right? Yes, just like you â€“ son of a bitch. Fuck off. Dongdong. The Little Tigers are so hot. Of course. Dongdong. Fang Yuan said if he could hit that balloon riding on the motorbike, you would be his sweetheart. How about doing something exciting tonight? Where? You'll know. We'll see. Now watch. Hey! That's my gun! Stop! I've got to see my sweetie. What are you doing? Honey! Now everybody I'm your God You should revere me as my disciples Play my music when you wake up Pray to me before going to bed Scream to me when you're in danger Can I take you out later tonight? San Pi. Your first time onscreen sex. Da Si won't take me. You can't count on him. You guys are very punctual. Mao Yan. Let's see a new one today. You should change your glasses. Days of Being Wild. Who's Wong Kar-wai? Who cares? Today is the very first time in your life. It's not over. I'm still alive. I'll give you ten more chances. Even more than that. Move your ass. It's my seat. Pardon? Are you deaf or what? I've lost my brother. I don't want to lose you, my friend. Mark, haven't you realized? Shut up. I don't need your pity. You owe me nothing. I never force my friends to do anything against their wills. I have my rule, which is to lead my life with dignity. You think I enjoy begging for stuff? I've suffered the past three years, only for an opportunity. I want to prove myself, not that I am superior to others, but I want everyone to know: whatever it costs, I will get back what I have lost. Bastards. Why don't you go up and give us a show? You good-for-nothings. When you're being nice, you're stalked anywhere. Don't you think the fire is like desire? You play billiards? I don't. How about giving me some hands-on experience? Sure. Eh, I'll go find a stick. It's midnight! Time to change the tape! Hurry up! Mao Yan! Get another tape! What are you rushing for? It's just a little past 12. Can't wait for masturbation, huh? I want a fish. What fish? That one is fine. I'll clean it. This one has any eggs? No. Let's do a bet. If you lose, grant me a request. Then I bet the fish does have eggs. You lost! There aren't any eggs. OK. What's your call? Tonight, let's meet at the ferry. What for? You'll know. Zhao Xiaolong. Good job. I want the one with explicit sex scenes! I wanted an original copy of Fallen Capital with the sex scenes. I asked Fang Yuan to bring me one, but he forgot. He just wanted to hook up with the girl. Li Dongdong asked Zhao Xiaolong to go to the Athletic Competition trial with her. But Xiaolong didn't make sense of it. He let us hang out with her together. So he told us to go together. Fang Yuan followed only girls. Da Si always followed suit, even if he didn't know what it was about. There is a light bulb. Look at you! Lazy bones. The cigarette's been here for a while. Is it safe to smoke it? How could I know? What do you know then? Try it and you'll know! Watch your mouth! Xiaolong. There's only one bed here. How can we deal with it? You may sleep on the floor. Why should I? Then who will? How about you? Fang Yuan. I don't feel well. Take me to get some medicine. Hurry up. It could be dangerous out there. I'll go with her. You're more dangerous. How's today? Are you ready? Sure. Good luck to you. Xiaomei told me she doesn't feel well. She's in her period? Very smart of you. Xiaolong. Don't you think the girls are even hotter while running? Li Dongdong. How did you come here by yourself? By ferry. Our school sent a coach to take you all here, but you didn't show up or tell anyone but with whose permission. You came with those boys, right? He just pointed a finger at me. Then teach him a lesson. Dongdong. Don't be too stressed, Mr. Zhu was worried about you. Relax. OK? Come on! Go ahead! Mr. Zhu, come with me. Everybody! Dongdong, good luck! Ready! I suggest you boys go back home. Why? What do you mean? Let's talk sense! Start the coach! Come on. What are you doing? We want to get on the coach. You are not allowed. That's bullshit. You want to play a gangster? Who's the gangster? There isn't even a gang in Qianchuan. That's nonsense. Which one of us looks like a gangster? Fuck off. Hey! Who do you think you are? What are you up to? Mr. Zhu, are you OK? What did you do? Is that respectful to a teacher? Where are your manners? Li Dongdong. Now get on the coach. Come on. Hurry up. I'll ask my dad to find you another school. I'm fine. It's a waste of time in our school anyway. They've decided to expel me. Fine by me. My family know some government officials in Wucheng. You don't have to do anything to earn a degree. Save the trouble. Not at all a trouble. Hello. Want some water chestnuts? Water chestnuts? Try some! No, thanks. Dongdong. San Pi. Da Si. Where's my book? You heard that? -Where's the book I asked you to buy? -Come here. -You never read a book. -Come. Roll. Is it like yours? Fuck off. Xiaolong finally broke from all those school shit! Cheers! Cheers. Deal. Goodbye. Safe ride. I'll see you soon. Xiaolong. Cheers Fang Yuan. Wu Yi. I'm asking you! I'm asking you! This is my restaurant. You guys. Let me introduce... Cut that out. That's Xiaolong and your gang. Come on. Have a cigarette. You also know these two? No, I don't. Hello, beautiful. Have a puff. Hello. Liu Xiaomei and Li Dongdong. Liu Xiaomei. She's a character. Sit down here. Fang Yuan is not playing nice. You guys brought the girls here without telling me first. You've never visited. This restaurant belongs to your father, no? His dad passed away. See, San Pi is always being so considerate. This one is to you! Xiaolong, Da Si and the girls. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Wu Yi. We knew each other since elementary school. Honey. Have some fish. You know what these fish are fresh caught every day. I know those fishermen pretty well. The fish is really good. Let me get you some. Fish is absolutely a good stuff. We'd like more after finishing this one. Sure thing. Hey, serve them another fish. Waitress. What are you doing? Don't. -What's this for? -You guys are only students. How could I possibly ask you to pay the bill? You don't have to do this. Hey, listen. Leave us be. You're my guests. It is my pleasure to treat you guys. -But you're not the owner. -My brother's business is mine as well. Take the money back. Waitress! Take it! Fine. We should thank Mr. Wu for today's treat. You can't do this next time. Never again. Is it a deal? Or I can no longer have you here, OK? Certainly. Cheers. Drink it up. Sweetie, you've got enough drinks? I can ask them to bring more Whatever you want to drink. What's with him? He drank too much than he could bear. He's not good at drinking. In those days we often hung out at Wu Yi's restaurant. His brother didn't count on him as a breadwinner. What is on her mind? Should we continue this guessing game? Or just forget about it We'll find a way to admit losing our honey Let us go at ease -How old are you? -Twenty. -Where're you from? -Qianchuan. -What do you like to do? -Running. -Are you fast? -Very. For real? Like real real? Stop it. Are you retarded? -No. -Are you sure? -Of course I'm not retarded. -Positive? But what the hell are you doing if you're not out of your mind? Drink it up. What're you doing? What's happened? Power off. Don't worry. Bring over candles. Like a wild flower Bathed in starlight when night falls Like a wild flower under the eaves Like a wild flower under the tree by the road Like a wild flower floating into my house Wild flower... Wild flower... Xiaolong. What's your plan afterwards? I don't know yet. I want to get into the sand junk business. Construction work is good. No, junk business is more profitable. Look over there. Those are the evil sand companies. We could do nothing with their presence. Why is that? They are all gangsters. Operating without license. They don't even pay for the diesel. I will beat them down one day. What's the big deal about oil? How much can they save from it? Do you know how much oil a carrier consumes every day? Do you know how much is a single barrel of oil? No license, free oil. Only money left. Why not asking your brother to take care of it? Oh, come on. Fang Yuan often said our motorcycle was outdated. So we decided to steal and sell some diesel oil, and use the money to buy a Honda. Turn it. Suck it. What? Suck it. Suck it. Hey. It's oil. It might explode. Feel shy. OK. It's full. Where's the barrel? Go and go. Let's keep this relationship. We don't need an invoice. 100, 150, 200, 250, 300. Did you steal the oil from us? You saw it? Come on, you just got out of there. Who else could it be? You're suggesting all the oil in there are our stolen goods? That's bullshit. Don't get upset. Give me the money. What are you doing? Let's not put up a scene. What's this? We're sorry. We're sorry. It could be a misunderstanding. This is what we got from selling the oil. -It's all here -Only this little? Come on. Don't waste time on them. You want to blackmail us? You're simply too young for this. Why not leave us alone? Be sensible, will you? That's all the money we got. If you want to pick a fight, we're in. You piece of shit. Fine. It's a misunderstanding. The money, you can keep it. Sorry. Sorry. What does that mean? There must be a wirepuller behind this. Drink it up. Cheers. Look at your shitty face. Wu Yi. Today's meal is on us. Oh, come on... Don't fake it. What is it? What is it? You really thought the guys didn't want the money back? Because they were afraid of you? The money is for your medical expenses after you get beaten up. I'll put it this way. The guys from the junk business are all gangsters in disguise. Well, we're not afraid. -We can knock them over. -Let's do it! You are confident, aren't you? Have you ever thought about how many ships they have? How many people they have? You want to pick a fight with them? I bet you're the ones to be knocked out first. You've no idea what you're up to. Wu Yi. This Guan Yu statue is not properly positioned. You should sort out your mind. Here comes your dish. When did I buy oil from you? Yesterday. Here's all the money you paid us. Hurry up. What's that attitude? What attitude? The money is here. Let's save our energy. Look. We run bus service with the government authorization. We purchase oil through procedures. And can you give us any invoice? Are you kidding me? You won't admit it? You're trying to make a scene? I will call the police right now. Sir. Don't get upset. Do us a favor. It won't be make much difference without our oil. Cut the crap. Take the money and fuck off. Are you giving us back the oil or not? Wang, call security. Do us a favor, Sir. Just this time. Come back. You're being unreasonable. In my opinion, money talks. Money? How much? We can borrow some from Wu Yi. Let me see if there're any other solutions. Now the problem is: will they take it if you give them the money? Stop thinking about the money. We should return the oil. You shouldn't have stopped me when I wanted to beat that guy in charge. I'll go again tomorrow. I'll talk sense to him. You know what? You just don't get the rules. Let's go. Let's go. Dad. I'm going to meet Fang Yuan and other guys. Do as what I said. How about the oil? Ask Wu Yi about it. Xiaolong talked to him. Won't be a problem. You guys take your time. I'm leaving. Da Si. Come on over. What's your matter? Looking for troubles all day along. What the hell did you guys do? Let me see. Not too much. We are good. We just stole some oil from the sand junk by the river. But got into trouble after selling it. Then we had a fight. That's all. Give back the money. We have none left. Da Si. I'm off. Da Si. Wait here for San Pi. Fang Yuan and I are going first. Keep the motorbike. Also, don't forget to get some oil from Wu Yi. It's a deal. OK. Take care. No problem. Wu Yi abetted us to revenge. He told us to set those guys' ship on fire. I didn't want to get involved. But there was no way to break apart. San Pi. San Pi. Let's go. What are you waiting for? San Pi and Da Si's oil. Skip that. What if someone shows up when they arrive? We'll get into real trouble. What's the matter with you? You're not a part of it. Don't get worked up. Here they come. Hurry. It's pure alcohol. You coward. Let's go. Xiaolong. What's this? Take it. What for? Li Dongdong. Found me before I came. She wanted to pay back the money for you. I thought she might be in our way. You don't have the balls, so I locked her up in my ship. Now go and find her. Where's she? She's not inside? -Where's she? -I told you she's right inside. Someone will come to fetch the oil. If I'm not here just let them take it. All right? -Now go inside. -Wu Yi. Good Lord. You've come here by yourself? Wu Yi. I want to ask you something. What's that? Do you know from which ship Xiaolong stole the oil? Why are you asking? I'll pay back on their behalf. Is this enough? Otherwise I have more. Is that enough? Where did you get this? None of your business. How about this? I'll give them the money. You may go home first. No way. You have to take me with you. Let go of me. Don't put a finger in this stuff. -Clear? -No. If you don't take me, I'm not going anywhere. All right. Follow me. Come. Follow me. Let me take that. Don't worry. Not a big deal. It's here. They'll be here soon. Where are they? Be patient. How much longer? I didn't do anything. I... I'm innocent. I'm innocent. You douchebag, capable of nothing. This case doesn't have much direct evidence. But he's the prime suspect. This case won't be an easy one. I understand. You can count on me. Agreed. No clue. A few days ago, did you see this girl? No idea. You didn't see her or can't remember? I didn't see her around. She and I have been here. Do you remember? My place hosts so many people every day. Give me a break. Thank you. Please try your best to find her. We don't know what to do. We understand its severity. We really feel for you. Li Dongdong's disappearance was soon filed as a case by the police. Similar cases once happened by the Yangtze River. But since then, Zhao Xiaolong started his endless journey searching for Dongdong. After the accident, my father transferred me from my old school to a school of dentistry in Shanghai. Fang Yuan saw me off on the day I left, but Dasi never showed up. Sir, we're closed. What are you doing? Looking for trouble? What's his issue with that discotheque? Who's here for Dai Siwen? Us. He refused to see you. You may leave. Call 8022060. The message is, "I need to see you, "Show up now" Call three times. Li Dongdong's disappearance was reported as a missing case. Wu Yi confessed that he abetted us to burn down the ship and was imprisoned for a while. He was soon released. He kept fooling around every day, playing mahjong with some rascals. Nine Bamboo. Eight Bamboo. Nine Bamboo. Red Dragon. Who wants it? Now watch. Come on. What? What is it? What's so funny? He was playing "nice" again. It's not my fault. Not again! Thanks, guys. It's your day. You lucky dog. Hey. Please pass me that water bottle. I need to take a leak Come on, get out to pee. OK. Wait a second. Six Suit. Three Dot. That boy is away for half an hour. Did he run away? No way! He owes me a lot. Who's that? Who's that? Do you have any clue who I am? Free me. Do you know the consequences after kidnapping me? Untie me now and I won't come after you. Release me now. Now. Hello. What are you doing here? I'm looking for a job. Here? It won't be an easy one. Boring and exhausting as hell. Can you take it? Sure. You have to wash the ship to check out the cables and to do the cleaning. Are you sure? Zhao Xiaolong, release me, now! You hear me? Untie it now. Now. I didn't kill her. I swear. I don't eat peppers. Is anybody here? Anybody? Anybody? Hello? Hello? Hello? Mister. Mister. The fishing season is about to start. Check out these firecrackers. You must have a fruitful year. You must have a fruitful year. These firecrackers sell really well. That's not true. Hey. That's not necessary. That's not necessary. Why should I take care of such petty stuff as scaffolding? Mr. Wu. -Go back to work. -Where's your brother? Mr. Wu, take a look. You've come to me for the money. Come on. Mr. Wu. You're a man playing by rules Debts should be paid. I can't find Wu Yi, so I've come to you. Fine. I'll look for him. Keep that IOU. OK. We'll settle everything once we find him. We're leaving. See you later. It's not okay. How long has Wu Yi been away? That's quite a while. You didn't spot him these days? No. When do you plan to release me? Have you thought about the consequences? I'd like to hear. Your brother will hassle me? So you think I'll send my brother? Who else would it be? You? With eyes wide open? How much longer do we need to wait? Don't get yourself involved in their stuff. OK? What do you mean? Everything is over after tonight. Stay here. Wait a second. You tell me. Wu Yi. What do you mean? You know what? The ship you burnt down is my brother's. You told us to destroy your brother's ship. You know nothing. Without your brother, you're nobody. You all believe that my brother wipes ass for me? My brother went to Shenzhen when I was five. He didn't come back when my dad died. I was there at his death-bed. Now he's back. He's the boss. He always has a say. He is always right, while others keep making "mistakes". Your brother is looking for you. It's fine. Those ships are illegal. He's afraid to call the police. Now leave. I didn't know Li Dongdong is your girlfriend. I thought she's Fang Yuan's girl. Everyone tells his preferred version of the same story. In Fang Yuan's memory, Li Dongdong liked him. Like a wild flower Bathed in starlight when night falls Like a wild flower under the eaves Like a wild flower Hot. Really hot. How about coming to dinner with me tonight? Good luck, Li Dongdong. Let me take care of that. Wild flower... Take it. Excuse me. Have a cigarette. I'm wondering. People on board are dumping something into the river. What are they? The sick pigs from the farm. Why into the river? Sick pigs need to be cremated, but cremation costs a lot. But it's a different talk if you dump them into the river without others' knowledge. That's enough. Cut the bullshit. Thanks. Thanks. Why the rush? Excuse me. Are you recruiting apprentices? Hey, calm down. I will ask no more about what you did to my ships. I know I couldn't blame that boy only. What's between you and Wu Yi and what sort of rifts between you guys are none of my business. He's missing now. You two cannot get away. I assume I am right. The other two boys of your gang... Where are they? One has moved. How about the other one? No clue. You don't know? OK. Mr. Wu, Wu Yi is back. Get off. I'll get you out of prison. I'll give the discotheque some damage fees and some medical fees to the guy you hurt. Your case is not a big problem. You won't be here long. I'm looking for my connections. Liu's uncle is... - Stop looking. Why? How have you been? I've done my investigation. Wu Yi shouldn't have anything to do with Li Dongdong's missing case. He trapped her in the ship. How about Fang Yuan? What's happened to him? We went out to search for Dongdong together. We got into a fight. Last time I checked out on him, he was fooling around as usual. What are your plans? I'll keep looking. I will spend the rest of my life looking for her. You won't give up? Of course not. Nobody's gonna fool me. Stop looking. What? Stop looking. You'll end up nowhere. What do you mean? Stop looking for her. You won't be able to find her. I think Fang Yuan can't win Li Dongdong. Why? She never laughs with him. It's serious. Li Dongdong falls for whom? How should I know? She loves whom? It's none of your fucking business. Watch your language. On that day, San Pi and I went to get the oil. Why does Li Dongdong hook up with Wu Yi? I have to take a look. Why bother? Xiaolong is waiting for us. I'm going. I won't allow it. Are you coming? I thought they were up to something. So I followed them. I cursed her for being slutty. Such a prick. Later, I smashed the discotheque simply to hide in here. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I was really scared. Mr. Wu, you have a meeting at 2 p.m. OK. Mr. Wu, I'm a reporter from communication radio. I want to ask you several simple questions. Sure. I often listen to your program. Let's make it brief, all right? Certainly. Would you please tell us: how does your company provide support in the aftermath of this flood? Our company purchased a thousand tents, which will be sent to the devastated areas tonight at six. We won't let our people suffer. Flood is heartless, but by no means is humanity. Are you in the office? Stop calling me. Ma said he shipped the goods to you. You've got to pay him the money. I already gave you your share. Ma's money has nothing to do with you. That's not what I mean. I introduced you to Ma. What should I tell Ma? It's against my rules. We're now in the charity cause, donating million bucks every day. Is it appropriate to bring this up now? Be considerate, will you? It's not a lot of money anyways. Zhao Xiaolong, would you please be a little more appropriate? Let's talk later. Fine. Xiaolong. Wu Yi didn't answer my call. It's OK. Friendship matters more. You're by my side. There's nothing to be scared of. -Let's go and find him. -OK. -You're not allowed to come in here. -We have an appointment. My boss didn't tell me. I just called your boss. My boss doesn't have friends like you. -Come on. -We knew each other since young. You're breaking into others' property. That's very rude. Hey, what are you doing? It's ridiculous. I'll call security to come. We know each other pretty well. I called him just now. That's nonsense. My boss isn't here. He doesn't have friends like you. I'm calling security. Save the trouble. We had a deal over the phone. Please Sir. Xiaolong. Give me a hug. Have a seat. Long time no see. It sure is. I'm late. I'm sorry. Come. San Pi. You haven't changed a bit. Neither have you. None of us has changed. Fang Yuan... You're still a hypocrite after all these years, picking a Japanese style restaurant. Come on. It's been years. Only three of us? I also contacted Da Si. He's in his hometown. He said he would manage. Xiaomei will also come. The couple. What are they doing back there? I don't know what Da Si has been up to. Xiaomei is with the Huangmei Opera troupe. You're always so resourceful, getting us a reunion. You're the most difficult one to find. Otherwise the reunion wouldn't take that long. You two have caught up? No. Though we live in the same city. It's my fault. I should've suggested first. Ah, right. This is my job. If anyone you know needs furnishing service... So you've become a business owner. Glass. Nothing much to speak of. What you guys are engaged in is really beyond my expectation. It never occurs to me that you'll become a doctor. How's that possible? His father is a doctor. Just to feed myself. You're the only one living in a big city. We're all losers if you can just "feed" yourself He graduated from Tongji University, right? A Tongji-accredited doctor is a big deal. Come on, you're the ones who own businesses. Cheers. Ah, yes. The other day one of my stores bought in a discarded car. You know what? I was there that day. So I helped clean up. The trunk was a huge mess. So I sorted out those stuff. -Can you imagine what I found? -What? I went to the police station several times. They didn't find Dongdong But check out the year of this calendar. It was later than the day Dongdong went missing. At least half a year. Is it possible that Dongdong is still alive? Well... Probably. Where's Da Si? I'll call him. San Pi. Do you think Dongdong is still alive? Hard to say. What? What's with him? I don't know. Don't drink too much. Fang Yuan, would you get out for a second? I need to speak to San Pi. What is it? Why can't you talk while I'm around? Be straightforward. San Pi said, Dongdong is probably alive. Well, I also think that's possible. Then keep your imagination. Forget about it. San Pi, if you say Dongdong is not dead, you're a prick. San Pi, you said Dongdong is possibly alive, but Xiaolong said you're a prick. What did he mean? You're super busy, so I won't keep you long. I'll see you later. This is a membership card from my auto care and maintenance. Take it. Fang Yuan... to be frank, I know the truth. I was there. That's enough. I don't want to hear. I would keep my mouth shut if I were you. Xiaolong, you're still so inappropriate after all these years. Let bygones be bygones. We can drop it. Hands. Eyes. Shoulder. Relax. That's a pagoda tree. Come and take a look, my dear. Where are you supposed to look? There. Liu Xiaomei. Dai Siwen. What's brought you here? Take a seat and have some water chestnuts. No, thanks. Let's go. Now? They are waiting for you. Xiaolong, why not have a simple meal at home? No, thanks. Why don't you join us? OK. You'd better not come. Then I'll have a couple of drinks with them. Hold on a second. Da Si. You're late. Take a seat. Bottom up for being late. What kept you? It's been raining. Traffic is not good. Where's Liu Xiaomei? She's not coming? Da Si. Do you remember what you told me when I went to see you in jail? Could you repeat that? Pardon me? What did you say? It's been a long while. Why bother to bring up the jail? Am I right, Da Si? How have you been? Getting along well with Xiaomei? You two have a kid? Da Si. Please. Do me a favor. Repeat what you said. Zhao Xiaolong. Fang Yuan. Zhao Xiaolong, what are you up to? Why are you so obsessed with the past? No one is flawless. Let bygones be bygones. Why are you creating a scene here? Now look. Are you satisfied? Not yet? Why not kill him and throw San Pi into the river? And I will take my own life. Are you fucking happy? Tell me why. Why should it be Li Dongdong? Explain it to me. Now. It was not intended. He spent six months in jail. Only six months? It's usually seven years for homicide. -Why? -Only six months? Da Si is your dear friend. That was an accident. You push someone off the ship You call that an accident? Are you out of your mind? I'm not. What are you afraid of? Neither of you admitted the fact after I came here. Zhao Xiaolong. It's been ages since the last time we met. Are you really doing this? You're not going to see us for the rest of your life? I just want to get justice done today. Why? Justice. See? Not satisfied? What justice? I just want to know. Why? Why can you get away? Zhao Xiaolong. You'll get us nowhere if you keep looking for trouble. I don't care. Fine by me. We won't be friends any more -You're insane. -I'm not. Take a look at Da Si. Is this what you're asking for? Calm down. You're being unreasonable. You have lost your mind. Haven't you? Xiaolong. Come on. Xiaolong. Xiaolong. Xiaolong. Xiaolong. Da Si. Don't go. Lean forward. That's the art of photography. Give me a sexy smile. OK. Stop it. -Stop now. -Are you looking for anyone? You! Come out. Let me ask you this. If you have a daughter or a sister, will you let her take photographs like this? I'll make her a big star. What star? Cut that talk. You're lying to them. That's very improper. Where's your conscience? Over the past years, the river reeds have always crossed my mind. Fluffy, swinging. Just like a traitor. Are you a meat person? Fuck off. Dong Borui, who works at your company, went to look for a job in Japan. To do some odd jobs. He's even been to Japan. Well... Normally, people go to Guangzhou to hunt a job. Why Japan? I have no idea. I want to go there myself. I only see Japan in photos. In fact, none of us has been to Japan. Except we've had Japanese food. We used to believe the cruises along the Yangtze River could take us to Japan. I hear it's a lot of fun in Kabukichou and at maid cafÃ©s. But we will never go there as a gang. Even watching pornos together is out of the question. That could be embarrassing.
