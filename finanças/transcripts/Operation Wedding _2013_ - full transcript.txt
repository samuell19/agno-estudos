My name is Windy. I'm the youngest of four sisters. I have three sisters. Vera who has low self-esteem. Lira who is so beautiful. Tara who is very smart. And that handsome man is my dad. And I am his favourite daughter. But, don't tell it to my three sisters. My superiority over my sisters... ... is holding breath. Operation Wedding Come on! I'm also good at sack race. But, it's not just an ordinary sack race. That's because every Independence day, my dad always reminds us... ... about our nation's fight for freedom. My second superiority... ... is never giving up. To "Hati Tulus" Orphanage Jend. Sudirman Street Number 3, Merauke, 99619 My three sisters are close and unified. Moreover when they try to get rid of me And after that incident, my dad resigned from Navy. When I was in elementary school, I had an enemy. My enemy's name was Rendi. Rendi was the son of my father's aide. Your stories were good as well. Windi. Windi, I'll go ahead. - But, after I hit him... - It's a fish for you. ... it seemed he had a concussion. Because his behaviour when he met me was peculiar. My dad also didn't like it if there's a boy with weird behaviour towards me. Stop, don't cry. It's good he didn't make you do push-ups. Good! Every Saturday night, we always anticipate Liverpool's victory. - That's it! Give him red card! - You never walk alone! This is an example of bad player. He was at fault, yet debating the referee. Soldiers must not do that. When soldiers are given orders, they must not debate it. Because orders are meant to be carried out, not debated. But, Dad, if the orders are wrong, then what? Do all soldiers must obey? For soldiers, there's no wrong order. Even when life is at stake, we must do it. Apa Ibu selalu taat perintah Ayah? Hanya satu Kali ibumu melawan perintah Ayah. But, she considered it the best for her. Is that why mom left? It's alright. Don't be sad, Dad. When you grow up, you'll marry... ... and leave me as well. When I grow up, I won't marry. So I can always be with you. What are you doing! - Let me go in first. - The older one... - ... goes first. - No way. No way. Tara. Sis... What's wrong. You event fight over bathing. What is it that you don't fight over? You want the keys? Here. Not a chance. The older one goes first. Be patient. - When she's done, my turn. - That's cheating. No way. Number two, three, four. The youngest one. - No way. - No way. You can't do that. I woke up first, so I should go first. - I'm the one who woke up first. - I woke up first. Good morning, Sir! A calling for Mr Santosa. You're being awaited at the main entrance. I repeat, Mr Santosa is being awaited at the main entrance. Thank you. Bye, Dad. Just do it. Until finished... Bye, Dad. - Hi, Honey. - Hi. Dad! Why do boys nowadays act like girls? - Okay. I'll pick you up at 7.00 PM. - Okay. Bye, Dad. Excuse me. Do you remember me? - Who are you? - Who am I? You remember, don't you? - No. Sorry, I don't know you. - Come on. What! I've told you I don't know you. I'm in a hurry! Don't be so rude. Miss! - Miss! You'll definitely know this. - What do you want! - Her! - Ouch. Take that. Win, it's me. Your friend at elementary school. Rendi! - Oh my God! Rendi? - Yes! I'm so sorry. Gosh, how are you? Not fine. See? Sorry. Since you're so different... Of course. More handsome. No way. Not really. You're more like a nerd now. Damn it. You don't change at all. - Really? I'm more fascinating now. - You wish. - I'm really better, right? - What's better? - You're still this short. - No way. That's not right. After your dad resigned from Navy,... ... my dad was transferred to Merauke by Navy. Then went to middle school in Maluku. My highschool was in Papua. Then I go to college here. At Medical School. That's cool. So that's why... ... after graduated elementary,... ... I seldom saw you. Even almost never. It's too far. I know. By the way, Win. Who is your lover now? Lover. Lover? Love... You mean boyfriend? Why do you ask that? Nothing... I just want to know. Is that wrong? Do you have a girlfriend? Well, there are a lot of girls who like me... Well, I'm not one of them. That's the problem... Stop joking... Win. After class... ... let's go out. That's... I can't do that. My dad will pick me up. How about tomorrow? Tomorrow... I can't. My dad will pick me up. Is your dad grumpy? No, he's not grumpy. How should I call it... He is... Like... Overprotective... Yes... No... That's hard... Somehow... Alright, then. I have a practice class. I'll go to the autopsy room. Bye. Rendi! Wait a minute. - Here. Saturday. - What's this? Pick me up, okay? Okay. Alright, then. Bye. Ren! What is it now? You can't wait for Saturday, can you? Don't be too full of yourself. That's my drinking bottle! Right... Sorry. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. What should I do? - Dad? - Yes? It's... Dad? Nothing... I forget... What should I do? - Dad. - What is it? Do you still remember Lieutenant Susilo? Your former aide? Yoyo? I still remember him. How about his son? Rendi? The fat boy whom you often beat up? Yes. The very fat boy. You remember? But, maybe because I often beat him up that time... ... he is thin now. - Yes. - Really? Yes, Dad. That means he is funny, right, Dad? What if he is funny? If he is funny, then he is not dangerous, right? Dangerous? What is dangerous? Nothing, but... How... Actually, Dad... ... Rendi asked me out on Saturday... - Dad... - Ouch! Dad, what happened? You hit people or dog? I hit a sissy. Sissy, Dad? Poor him. Sissy! How is he, Dad? - Is he bleeding? What... - No, Dad. How is it, Dad? May I go? What did you ask, Win? What did you ask? You're still too young to go on a date. - What a mess! - A date? It's not a date. It's just hanging out. It's different, Dad. How is it? Okay. If you just want to hang out. Noisy! - Hey, stop! - Windi, you're noisy! Noisy! It's just hanging out. - Thank you, Sir. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you ready? - Just a moment. A moment? What? What? What? What do you mean by what? Nothing, Sir. It's okay if they come too, right? Alright. It's okay then. Okay, then... ... let's go. So, why haven't you had a girlfriend yet? No particular reason... Let me tell you what kind of girl I like. She must be independent,... ... brave,... ... and not pampered. Is there such a girl? - Of course. - Like who? Like you. We haven't see each other for a long time... ... and now you are suddenly full of sweet words. You must remember. You were the only girl who dared fight me. And beat you. Don't forget that. Don't you forget as well. That's when we were kids. - Are you sure? - Of course. - Windi? - Yes, Dad? Please order a cup of coffee. Less sugar, no coffee grounds. Okay, Dad. Listen... - Let's make a bet, shall we? - I heard from Windi... - ... that you want to be a doctor? - Deal? Yes, Sir, a surgeon. The we have the same expertise. Which expertise, Sir? We are both expert in cutting corpses. Once, I was adrift at sea for months. Everyday, The crew shuffled our turns. Turn for what, Sir? To be eaten. Because we ran out of food stock. I, as the commander, had a duty to cut up... ... and distribute it to the crew. As a commander, I got the head. Eating eat by opening its brain... ... salting it, giving it some pepper... ... then I ate it. Sometimes I also ate its scalp. But, the most delicious ones are its eyes. But, eating eyes must be careful. If you take the wrong bite,... ... all the fluid will come out. Sir, excuse me. Ren? What's wrong? Rendi? Dad, what's wrong with Rendi? I don't think he is the right person for you, Windi. Trust me. Get over it, Win. It's not just you who is not allowed to go on a date. We both have a boyfriends. But, you know, we are not allowed to go on a date. It's... - It's what? - It's hard to see each other. So, you've already had boyfriends? That time my boyfriend was bullied by Dad until he passed out. My boyfriend... was shot with a pi... - With pee? - Pistol (Gun)! Pistol (Gun)? Dad threw firecrackers at my boyfriend. Great, isn't it? If it continues like this, we will be spinsters. That's right. What if we get out when he is sleeping. We've tried that already. Dad seems to have a sixth sense. He wakes up if we do that. What about afternoon? In the afternoon, Dad uses his seventh sense. Think about it. The moment I get out from my office... ... Dad is already at the parking lot. That's too much. That's too advanced. More advance than technology. The point is, if Dad still awakes, he will always oversee us. Unless... ... he is watching something. Watching what? - That thing, ball... - Football! Okay, good night, wherever you are. We meet again in Big Match show. It's Manchester United versus Liverpool. Tonight, I am not alone. I am accompanied by Bung Kam. Okay, Bung Kam. Let me ask you. What is your prediction? Can Manchester United defeat Liverpool? Mr Ali! Mr Ali! It seems Liverpool is more favored to win than MU. Okay, but of course... No, tackled. How come? That was not an offense. The referee takes a side. This is cheating. Okay, shoot! Shoot! Okay! Headbutt! Head... Yes! Just like that? Shoot! That's really bad. That was really bad. He should shoot it. That should be a goal. Shouldn't, it, Dad? That's the thing he should do, right? And then it was really like that. It should be... There was no target or anything like it, right? So, they just shot randomly... ... then, so, it was like that, isn't it Dad? That's really... Just like that. It's some kind of... - They play it lame. - Where are you going? Upstairs, Dad. Doing homework. I have a pile of homework. Okay? Yes, okay. Let's do it. Do what? W... Washing hand? I have. W... We kiss. Kissing? Yes, kissing. Do you want to get it in now, honey? Yes, but open it first, then get it in. But, it's difficult, sticky. If you don't open it, how it can get in? It will rip it. Okay then, please gently. Help me, please. Here, it's the tip. - Like this. Here? - Yes. It's good, isn't it? One more for my collection. You're so sweet. Goal! Win. Do you know? Actually, I already like you since elementary school. But, I was not brave enough to say it. Why? Because you were ill-tempered. Now I am still ill-tempered. I see that. The difference is just you are now prettier. You were ill-tempered back then. Now you're not. What a sweet talk. I'm really sure you often... ... talk like that to hundreds of girls. What, no... I never talk like this to another girl. I only talk like this to one girl. To a girl who waits for me for 10 years. Who? Don't be full of yourself. Just give it up, Win. That's the prove. You still keep my drawing in elementary school. You even still keep the fish. Now it's look like an old fish. But... You... Are you really serious with me? If I am not serious,... ... why should I come here at night like a robber. And the risk is being shot by your dad. Why should I? - What if he really shoots you? - That's fine. As long as I already get the answer from you. What answer? That you likes me too. Windi! Dad! Dad! What's wrong? Dad! I'm so scared! I was so scared... - I was so scared, Dad! - It's alright. Calm down. - What happened? - It's a nightmare. I'm afraid, Dad. I'm so scared. Hey! Don't run! Robber! Hey! Robber! - Where's the robber? - Robber! - Don't run! - There's no robber! Dad, there's no robber! Dad! Li, if there's a robber breaks in again,... ... I'll shoot you! - Do you understand? Go. - Yes, Sir. Hey. Because of you, it's hard for us to bring our boyfriends in. You are so annoying. Why am I always the one to blame. - As if you grudge me. - I do. Don't you realize that you are a troublemaker? And because of you, I, Lira, and Vera... ... we are unlucky since we were kids. - Sis, what did I do wrong? - You're the one at fault! Your fault is because you were born. - Do you understand? - What do you mean? Sis! What do you mean? Tara! - Go away. - What do you mean? Go away? Shut up! Dad. It's time she knows about Mom. What's wrong with both of you? Like I said, Dad? It's time she know about Mom. Dad. What does Tara mean? 15 Mei? It's the same as my birthday. Her uterus condition was very weak. The doctor himself did not suggest... To continue the labor process? That means... Mom had broken your order, right, Dad? Forget it. Let's go home. Win. Windi. Ouch. Rendi? Rendi, are you okay? I'm okay. I want to talk to you. Me, too. But, don't you have a practice class today? Hey you, sit down. Win. - I want to talk to you. - Okay. Me, too, but... Please, be quiet. We'll start our class. I told you to sit down, didn't I? Do you want to lecture instead of me? No, Sir. Alright. I'll continue last week lesson... ... about communication. So, in communication there are five types of level. There are five tips of communication. The first one. Interpersonal communication. Or communication between two persons. The second one, interpersonal communication. Or self communication. The third one, many persons communication. Or group communication. The fourth one, organization communication. And the last one... He can't stand continuing relationship like this. I will explain about interpersonal communication. Interpersonal communication... ... involves... It's an active internal involvement from individual... ... in a symbolic process. Please, forgive my Dad. I didn't say anything. It's alright. One of the example... Write this down "Last night I'm sure..." ... sending letters. Let me see that. So sweet. Maybe it will be easier to understand... ... if it is read... ... by the communicator. Step forward. - But, Sir... - Come here. Give an example to your friends... ... about how sending letters communication is like. Don't be just a whisperer. Come on. Begin! Read... Read... Win. Last night I was sure... ... we were not meant to be together. But... ... sea never leaves the shore. Moon never leaves the shore. Stars never leave the sky. And I... I will never leave you. You are my soul mate. We can't break up. Because we are one heart. I'm already in love with you, Win. I want to marry you, Win. Win! Win? Married? Yes, Sir. You want to get married? You guys haven't even finish your college yet. You haven't work, then... ... how will you feed my daughter? With love? Soon I will finish my study, Sir. Yes, but still you're still too young. Although I'm still too young, I promise... ... I will never let you and Windi down. Right now. I cannot accept your proposal. Why, Sir? Because I will let daughters get married in sequence. Starting from Tara, Lira, Fera,... ... then Windi. That means if their boyfriends come to propose,... ... you won't get in the way, right? Do you promise me? Okay, I promise. It's hopeless to expect Beni to propose. Why is that? He is already engaged by his parents... ... with a village girl. And Beni... ... can't refuse... ... and he said that this girl would come to Jakarta... ... and met Beni. But, Beni chooses you, right? Of course! That's clear! Okay. How about you, Fira? What about Herman? Does he brave enough to propose you? It's hopeless. Rejected Herman... ... is a coward. He also desperate easily. Let alone proposing... ... just seeing Dad's eyes... ... he wouldn't dare. It's difficult then. What about Tara's boyfriend? Feri is not afraid of Dad... ... but he is afraid of something else. How could you? You never come home, never let me know... ... where you are, with whom, what you are doing. How can that be? - Stop! Listen. - Hey! It's useless for me to come home just so you can mock me. Anything I do is always wrong to you. - Listen to me just a moment. - Forget it. Wait a second! I'm talking to you! Stop it. I can't stand it anymore. Moreover, you don't see me as your wife anymore! You're too demanding! - Stop it! - Hey! What is it now? Don't bump me! It's forbidden for me to bump you! You just think about money! - Listen up! - What? I want you to divorce me, okay? Fine! You want me to div... ... divorce you, okay. Yes, I want you to divorce me. Like right now. - Understand? - Who do you think you is? I don’t care. I'll give you what you want. Wait a minute! What do you want just now? A divorce? Okay. It's a divorce then! I've said it three times! - Satisfied? - Three times! How many is that? Four. Step aside. I'm mad right now. Why are you fixing me? All this time I bear that you always dress up like a boy. - What? - So what? - So what? - I'd rather marry someone who... Step aside! - You step aside! - Don't get in my way! - I want to go there. - You... So stressed. Then I go home with whom? And because he often deals... ... divorce cases.... ... he is so afraid of marriage. Okay. Okay! Let's make Lira's,... ... Vera's, and Tara's boyfriends... ... come to Dad to propose. Agree? - Agree! - Agree! That's right. High five! Do not disturb The timeline. This one, location. Office. Good. This is the last one. That's it. - This must be successful. - Succ... Succ... All three of you must succeed. This one use Y. Great. Let's high-five. Hey, that's your dad's girlfriend. Take care of this car, this is a car for a man,... ... not for loser like you. - Come on. - You go on, Dad. I want to go to the book store. Okay. Herman. You love Vera, don't you? Then when do you want to propose? I'm afraid. Your dad is scary. I'm scared being shot. Just relax. I know how to deal with it. - Hi, Dad. - Excuse us... Hi. Test... To... To Mr Hardi... .. .with all respect. My name is Herman. I want to... ... propose your daughter. Vera. Please forgive me. If I say it this way. I love your daughter. But, I am afraid to speak to you directly. It's because you're ill-tempered. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Go. - It's you who wants to marry her? - You're the one? - No, Sir, that one... Please forgive me. Mrs Ati. - Where is Dad? - What? Your dad is sleep... Your dad is sleeping. Okay, we want to go out. But, please don't tell anybody. Okay? This is it. - Are you sure? - Trust me. I'm sure. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam, Mr Hajj. Sir... We want to meet Mr Beni? Mr Eni? - Beni. - Yes, Mr 'Eni? Beni, not Eni.

I was just about to pick you up. I don't like to be picked up by you. I don want you to pick me up. And I don't want you to be my son-in-law. - Ask for mercy to God, Dad. - Mercy? This is not right. Tell your parents... ... that this engagement is cancelled. - Dad... - Let's go home. I said go home! Let's go. - Beni! - Let's go home! By... - Bye... - Alright! - Alright. - High five. Hi, Boss. What is it? Yanto. - Yes, Boss? - What is this? Those are called flowers, Boss. I know that those flowers... - ... but why are those here? - Hi, honey. - Hi, honey. - Thank you for everything. I like it a lot. You are actually romantic. What? Don't pretend. Pretend? It's all from you, right? It's impossible I mess my office like this. You have another boyfriend, right? Right? To Tara, be mine forever. To Tara... With love. To Tara my soulmate. To Tara I like you. To... - To Tara I love you? - So what if I do? So what? Just so you know, all of my sisters are being proposed. So when will I be? You knew all along that I am not ready to get married, right? Feri! I hate you. Man, don't... - Tara, wait. - Let me go. Tara, wait. Let go of me. Will you marry me? I love you. I love you, too. Tara! Come quick, they are here. Come out quick! Who? Our boyfriends, of course. They want to propose. Let's go. Alright, wait a minute. What? You go first. Favourite daughter. Dad. Dad... You've promised that if there is a guy who come... ... to propose, you will not get in the way. Right, Dad? Yes. I promised that. Hey, speak. We know that you really love us... ... and always take care of us since we were kids until now. That is the duty of a dad. Yes. But, there is another duty... ... for a father besides taking care and protecting his children. What? Answer it, you should speak. To guide and... .. to... What is it? "To guide and to escort his children to build..." - What is this? - ...their own family. "Their own family." But, if you choose the wrong husband... ... that means I've failed. But, how do you know... ... that our choice is wrong? So, you come here to propose my daughters? - Yes, Sir. - Yes. Okay. But, before I accept your proposal... One of you have to break Windi's record of holding breath. Lame. It hasn't been 30 seconds yet. I'm sure everyone won't hold it. - Lame. - What lame? What are you doing? Why can't you do it? I can't hold it anymore. But, you have to know that I'm already pregnant. Feri... Windi... Windi... Windi, wake up. - Windi... - Win... Windi. Windi, wake up. Sir, let's go. Let take her inside, Sir. - Okay. - Let's go. Let's go. What has happened? Gosh, Ms. Windi. What's wrong. You have to believe that this is your child. I don't believe it. So what? Who knows that it's not my child. Don't talk like that. Do you think I cheated? - That could happen, right? - No way, I'm with you. Gosh, sis, what has happened? Let me do it, Sir. Gosh, sis, What's wrong? How can it happen? - You're too... - Ti... Yes, Sir? Please bring me towel and dry clothes. Yes, Sir. How can it be? - Windi tried to help Rendi. - Then?

If Tara eventually gives birth without a husband,... ... that means I have failed to raise you all. No... Good. So you are the one who make Tara pregnant? - No, Sir. - No... This... Be quiet! Tara... He is the one who makes you pregnant? Answer, Tara. If it is true, he must bear the responsibility. - Sir, It's a mistake. That's not... - Be quiet! You're caught red handed and you have to be responsible for that. - Sir, you misunderstand. - Dad, no... It's... Sis, why don't you say anything? You have to tell Dad that it's just a misunderstanding. Sis, why are you so quiet? Sis! Why are you always lucky, sis? Dad always spoils you. You live the happiest life.
