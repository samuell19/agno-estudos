Antonio! Antonio! I was like them. I was 12, the year I became paralyzed. Was I paying for a sin at that time? Don't hate so. You mustn't blame god for something that's my fault. Sorry, papa. Forgive me. We must try another way. And because we're so close, for me, it's easier for me to live like this. I'll take it. Ippolita, darling. Don't worry. We'll help you all we can. Light the fire. I'm cold. Have you lost your tongue? You saw them embrace each other. And it wasn't the first time, was it? That's what the beautiful, studious journal was looking for here. Other than old books and manuscripts. She was looking for a bed. Father's bed. Could be marriage. What are you thinking of, my child? You only hurt yourself. It's to be expected. She's pretty and young and intelligent. She should be loved. She's a woman. What made me turn around the way I did, and see them? You're all upset today. Everything looks darker than it really is. You liar. You've never said a word, but you've known all about them! I'll help you undress. I'm able to do it. Do you need anything? You feel all right? Please help me get out of here. Where to? Get me out. Can't you tell me where we're going? I absolve you of your sins. In the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost. The blasphemous image of Christ. It was a sign of the devil, uncle! That's ridiculous! I asked your father not to risk sending you to such a place among those people. If god performs a miracle for you, he's good. He exists. He's your protector. If not, it's supposed to mean that he's abandoned you, but it's not quite like that. Ippolita, it's not so simple. Then why doesn't god make himself understood? The devil does, and clearly, too. He has been very clear to me. "Has god forgotten you?" Has your father forsaken you? Are you alone? Unhappy? Desperate? Here I am. All you have to do is call me and I will be with you. â€œI'll give you everything you have been denied!" That's enough! That's blasphemy. I know what you're going through, my child. God is testing you. But you must have faith. I've been trying to do that for years. Until now, it was my father's love that kept me going. But now I'm losing him. But how can you imagine that your father loves you less? Ippolita, you must learn to know yourself honestly. You're too possessive with your affection for your father. Yourjealousy is absurd. Abnormal. You must control it. Don't forget your father has also suffered a great deal. And you must try to understand. Your father is trying to build a new life for himself, too. You're right, you're right. Except, I'm unable to build one. You're so young. One day, you'll meet a man who loves you. What man could you possibly be talking about, uncle? There's never been anyone. No one has ever taken an interest in me. No one. I'll say a mass for you in the morning. This is the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world. Happy are those who are called to his supper. You are the chosen wheat of the lord. You are the bread from heaven. Stay with us, 0 lord. You are the wine that germinates virgins. You are, for the weak, the bread of the strong. Stay with us, 0 lord. You are the guide to the banquets of heaven. You are the pledge of future glory. Stay with us, 0 lord. You are the light that illuminates the world. You are the relief of our tiredness. Stay with us, 0 lord. Holy, holy, holy. Lord god of the universe. Heaven and earth are full... I was deeply shocked. For centuries, demonic sects have been profaning their holy communion sacraments during sabbath, by swallowing the head of a toad that had been placed upon an overturned chalice. But these things don't happen anymore. You're wrong. Sects of devil worshipers are springing up everywhere. It's a symptom of the spiritual crisis of our time. 400 years ago, the council of Trent was able to solve a crisis that was even more serious. But who's going to save us today? The answer is still the same. Outside of the church, there is no salvation. The council of Trent was an important moment in our history. It not only established fresh principles of orthodoxy, it also generated a new spiritualism. It gave us saints such as Teresa of avila, John of the cross, felippo neri. It may be, even today, equally important spiritual beings are living among us. It may be that we're not even aware of them. If our salvation lies in faith, what will ippolita do with losing hers? Ippolita is weak and disoriented. I wonder if she were foolish enough to join one of these sects. But how could she? She hardly ever goes out alone. You must stay closer to her. She feels abandoned, even by you. Ascanio, my affection for grettel could never diminish the love I feel for ippolita. I know, I know, but she's afraid it might, and she's suffering. I'm concerned she feels as she does about the presence of the demon. She could be seriously psychologically disturbed. She should be under the care of a good doctor. I recently met an expert in psychiatry and parapsychology. Perhaps he could help her. He's a skeptic, an unbeliever, but a fine doctor, nevertheless. I'll arrange a meeting one of these evenings, but it must appear to be accidental. Oh, felippo, how are you? - Oh, hi! - How've you been? Fine. - Hi. - Oh, look who's here. - Oh, filippo, hello. - Hello. How are you? Beautiful as usual. Well, nobody sees you anymore. You haven't fallen in love? I don't think that's it. All his friends say he's involved in something spiritual. It's true, isn't it? - Doctor sinibaldi? - Yes. - Please. - Thank you. This way. The number is clear now. You've written down a three. In mathematics, you know it's absurd, yet in other dimensions, it's not unlikely. It's possible, isn't it? That's as precise as I can get. I'm sorry. Now may I look at the paper? Don't tire yourself. You know I don't like this sort of thing. It's just a knack. Mariangela is much better at it than I. Would you like your hand read? - Here. - No, thank you, mariangela. I don't want to know what's going to happen. I'd rather wait and find out when it happens. You guessed correctly. May I see what's written there? Of course. "One plus one equals three. Isn't that possible?" So what do you say, Andre? Ippolita's answer is more than enough, don't you think? Well, I do want my hand read. All right, sit down. But I'm warning you, I always tell the truth. I'm very interesting. You know, you really have the most fantastic good luck! In everything. It makes me furious! - Ippolita. - How do you do? Hello. I'd like you to meet marcello sinibaldi. - Hello. - Hello. I got to know marcello in gestad. I told him so much about you that he came along to see if you're really as fascinating as I made you out to be. You didn't come here just for that. - You'll be disappointed. - Oh. You are fishing for compliments. You're a practicing psychiatrist, aren't you? Yes. Did felippo tell you? No. Really. - Let's go inside. - Excuse me. You see, I've always said that ippolita has extraordinary powers. In my opinion, she's a true psychic. Considering that this may be just a pleasant game, I'll tell you something else. Our meeting was no accident, was it? So you know that I've come here to treat you. And what are you supposed to cure me of? I'm going to cure you of your paralysis. What else? I thought it was worse than that. I've seen your hospital records. There is no organic lesion. So, uh, it must be a psychic shock. A violent trauma of some sort. We must discover what it is. Once we do, maybe I can cure you. Doctor, I have tried every possible cure. Hm. Did you try hypnosis? That, too. I'm talking about regressive hypnosis. A sort of research operation. A delving back into your earliest memories. Perhaps something from your previous life. You believe in reincarnation, doctor? Oh, it was scientifically proved that precise psychic facts could be transferred from generation to generation. This kind of hypnosis could bring those memories out. Well... Besides curing me, and have little hope of that but assuming you could help, doctor, I wonder if there's some mystery really hidden inside me. Now... Try to remember. Go back in time. Go back to your childhood. Remember. You are 12. Tell me... All about that day. That day. I'm in a car with my father and mother. We're coming back home from the country. My mother is nervous. I don't know why. Ah, I know. My papa is driving, but he's not looking where he's going. My mother is afraid of cars and he's making a joke about it. Such a good time we're having tonight. A dog! Oh, no! Oh! Oh, my leg! Father! Papa! Help me! I can't move my legs! My legs! My legs are dead! I can't move them! Help me, papa! Flames! Flames! Flames! Flames! Flames! There is no fire now. Now you're safe! But you have to continue. You have to go further back. Still further back. You've gone beyond childhood now. Before you were born. Go meet your past. Go further back. Don't be afraid. You're in another life. A life no longer your own. The life of someone else. Someone before you. Who are you? And it was a man they called Christ. And it was a man they called Christ! Tempted by Satan! And it was Christ who, in the temple, repudiated his mother! In the temple, repudiated his mother! And who damned the innocent fig tree! And on that day, in the temple, cursed the scribes! And the pharisees! It's the devil who speaks in her! She's a witch and speaks Satan's words in this holy place! She should be silenced! To the stake with her! Let the flame burn her! As her punishment! And a warning to others. To the stake! Your sentence doesn't make me afraid. Bastard! Priest! Bastard! Ippolita, come to yourself! Come to yourself! That's an order! How do you feel? I'm feeling all right, and you? Such long faces. Do you remember anything of what you just recalled? Do you? Absolutely nothing. It's as though I were asleep. What nonsense did I babble? It's too early to make a hypothesis. A few sentences, something about a psychic occurrence you were deeply concerned with. How very puzzling. I know one thing. I think we're definitely on the right track. You've undergone a serious traumatic shock. But I'm certain, after a few sessions, you'll be able to get up and walk. Alone. Is it true that you can cure her or not? Yes. I can cure ippolita. Once the trauma experienced by her ancestor's been cleared up, I'm sure we can cure her. It is an apparent reincarnation phenomenon. In other words, the personality of a dead person is present in someone else. On an unconscious level, of course. Ah, that's the theory of Dr. Ian Stevenson of the Virginia school of medicine. Yes, these are phenomena that happen very often, especially in psychic subjects like ippolita. Then your diagnosis would explain the demonic hallucinations that ippolita's been having. I must be honest. It's a diagnosis that's alarming. Cases like this often become phenomenon of possession. Assuming the personality of the ancestor, ippolita could, uh... Could very well lose her own. That's why we must act now. I must know more about this woman. The prince here and felippo gave me general information. I hope you can be more specific. We have everything you need. I see we have no choice. It was a painful and tragic event, that our family has always tried to hide. These papers were never meant to see the light of day. Now, it's important to ippolita's welfare. And so I'm entrusting them to your discretion. What an unhappy thing. Forced to be a nun, she runs away the night she enters the convent, and joins a sect of devil worshipers. Anything. Anything to attain freedom, love, for the tragic, moving figure. It's incredible how many similarities there are between her and ippolita. Not only the same name, but the same existential situation. The same anguish at life. The desperate need for love. Refusal of the faith. So much family history. It can be a burden. Hold him back! Get him away! You made this place so warm, so cozy. I'm glad you like it. I like it, too. I feel at home here. Especially when you're with me. Listen, massimo. Don't tell ippolita about us getting married. I wouldn't want her to suffer because of us. You know, I'm almost afraid to say it, but after so many years of anguish, wouldn't it be incredible if my family could finally find some peace again? The doctor seems to feel he can cure ippolita of her paralysis. Of course, there are some strange psychic phenomena, but maybe they'll clear up, too, in time. You don't seem convinced. Maybe I'm just afraid. Why? Why? Why? Ippolita oderisi. Thou art about to become a daughter of Satan. Art thou prepared? Art thou prepared? Yes. Purify thy body of the communion, that will pledge thee to Satan forever. This is his body. This is his blood. Ippolita. Ippolita! - Why don't you answer? - I don't want to be bothered. Miss? Did you fall down? Did you hurt yourself, miss? I don't recall. Help me get to my car. Help me, please. I can't walk. Oh, your purse! I'm sorry to have to ask you to come here so late, but ippolita's become worse in the two days since you've been here. You'll have to persuade her to continue with the hypnosis. Has anything peculiar happened recently? Since early this morning, ippolita seems very disturbed. It's too bad you didn't call me this morning. Please follow me. Ippolita. Go back in time. You're in that other life again. You're the other ippolita oderisi. And the inquisition tribunal has convicted you of being a witch. They've given you to the civil authorities for the execution of a sentence. They've condemned you to the stake. God. Save my soul. Forgive me. Give me strength. Strength, 0 god. Give me strength. The cross. - Enough, enough! - Ippolita, ippolita! Come back! And be yourself. That's an order. But I... Did I scream or... There. Now... Try to get up. I'm sure you can walk. - No. - Without any help. Don't move, felippo. She'll come over to you. Grettel, will you sit next to felippo? Doctor, you're over here by me. And you, the place of honor, at the head of the table. - Prepare another place. - Yes, that's a good idea. Ippolita, you look beautiful. I feel so marvelous. I feel as if I was reborn. You'll have to be careful for a while, however. Your legs will have to get used to holding you up again. Oh, they seem so normal, I'll be able to go running. Ah, that'd be wonderful to see. And I hope soon, doctor. Yes, I hope so, too. Well, your cure seems to have given you a huge appetite, ippolita. Yes, I'm really hungry. Well, that's a good sign. To the happiness of our dearest ippolita. Aren't you going to join us? What's the matter, dear? What did she say, grettel? Go ahead, tell him, grettel! Are you ashamed? Say it, go on! I said, "lick my ass, you whore." How many men have you fucked? Go ahead and tell him! Ippolita! How many have you had? So many cocks, you can't even remember, and you liked it! And tell me how my father's tastes. You like fucking him, huh? And you're going to marry her! - Marry a whore! - That's enough! - Are you crazy? - A cock sucker! A cock sucker! This time I'm not going to be cheated. Not by any shitty cross at the last moment. Oh, no. It won't happen again. This time, I'm going to even the score with the family. Ippolita oderisi is mine. Bishops! Cardinals! Men of the inquisition! I fucked all of you! Marcello, can't you do anything for her? Ippolita! I've been waiting 400 years to the day, but I piss on that time! For you, it's been no time at all. Felippo, I'm scared! Oh, how happy I was, the moment I saw another ippolita oderisi at the sanctuary, abandoned by her god. Her body aches. For a cock. She would go to the bottom of hell for it. Barter her soul. Follow me, ippolita. Join the devil and I'll give you all that you've been denied. Open your legs and spread your thighs apart and let me come inside you, all the way! Help her! She's out of her mind! Ippolita, come back! That's an order! In this century, I'm going to win. You bastards are afraid! You stinking... Look out! I'm going to win! I've already won! Stop those church bells! Stop them from ringing! Stop those church bells! - Stop them from ringing! - Ippolita, ippolita! Clean her up. You poor dear. Please take me to my... I want to go to my room. So tired. So tired. She'll be able to rest now. I'll give you a sedative. What's happening, doctor? I've never experienced anything so horrible. No. Any parapsychology student could give this a precise name and one for all we've seen. I don't know what it's called today, but in the past, it would've been called a case of diabolic possession. What are you thinking about, felippo? It's true, father. Take any theological study on the subject. The great desire and the revulsion for food and drink, speaking in a language one doesn't know, the power at a distance to, to move objects. They're all symptoms of diabolic possession. Ah, fillippo, be serious. We're no longer in the middle ages when epileptics were thought to be devils or an ulcer was cured by a prayer. I agree with you, but then ippolita should now be cured. Her "trauma", as you psychiatrists call it, that prevents her from walking, has been isolated and dissolved, but she's not better. She's worse! At least, psychologically. It was to be expected. It's just a transitive state. But you must admit one thing. Ippolita speaks in a male voice. And she says things that only the devil would say. No. Felippo, it's just another aspect of the same obsession. What you have told me pains me deeply. But we must be careful. Very careful, massimo. The church moves slowly in cases like this. And before talking about demonic possession, we must scientifically eliminate any other possibility. Psychiatrists. All they can do is put labels on things they can't explain. And you know what the doctor called it. â€œSexual frustration that brings on hysteric phenomena." Isn't that conceivable? Yes, but now he seems lost, too. Just like the rest of us. And it isn't because he thinks ippolita is to be possessed. Just tell me one thing. In your opinion, does the devil exist? There is no doubt about it. The pope himself reaffirmed it recently. And not as a concept of evil, but as a real presence. Then if you're that convinced, why don't you do something to help ippolita? I have the feeling you're frightened. I told you. We both must be calm, and cautious. Ippolita, are you asleep? No, come in. You haven't come by to see me today. Huh? Hello. It's hot. How do you feel? Bad, felippo. Bad. I'm depressed now. I wasn't happy for long. What do you mean? My legs don't move again. They're the same. Feel. There hasn't been any improvement. They're the way they'll always be. Please don't say that. You're going to walk again. I'm sure. What happened at dinner? I'm sorry, I don't recall a thing. Nothing serious. Sinibaldi says it's only a relapse. Once you overcome the stress, you'll be all right. The doctor is sure of it. Oh, stay with me, felippo. You're all I have. That's not true. Soon you'll have everything that you ever desired. You'll get married. You're so beautiful. I only want you. Your love for me. But you have my love. Forever. Remember when we were children? Only you made me feel beautiful. Beautiful and alive. And when should I come? Immediately. And the money? It is not just a simple case. Sure, I have cured lots of people, but I don't know anyone who donate to charity. I'll give you all you want, but hurry up. I don't want anyone to see you go in. Why not? What am I, an ogre? People come from all over to see me. Quiet. Shh. Wait a moment. Come in. Don't you dare look at me. Don't raise your eyes. Why haven't you recognized the lord supreme? He who can pulverize your bones and dry up the blood in your veins. He who has allowed you to work your stupid arts of magic, and now you try to use that magic against me. Lick it. Lick it! Get out of here! The devil! It's the devil! The devil! The devil! The devil! That man has seen the devil, father. There is no doubt. Even if our minds refuse to accept such a phenomena. We've got to help her immediately, othennise, she's lost. I called your uncle ascanio, and this time, by god, he's got to come. Oh, and another thing. Dismiss the servants. Ask them to leave the house. Except for Irene, if she wants to stay. Father! Excuse me for saying it, but you could help ippolita. More than any of us. I know. I've been thinking so much about that. You must leave. You must leave Rome and forget what we have between us. It was an illusion. A dream when I thought I could start a new life again with you. But this sense of guilt that I carry, the difficult reality of my family would have followed us and involved you, too. Do you really think that all it takes is just a few words and everything will be forgotten and canceled? But don't you see I have no other choice? I know, but it seems so unfair. I want you to know that what there was between us, what we have... What we had, meant so much to me. I've left her. We won't see each other again. Now I'll always be here. Right here. Dear ippolita. You think you put your conscience at peace? Huh? You've ruined my life. You've killed my mother! And you've driven me crazy by your vanity! All the while I was nailed to this chair, you were fucking that whore! You ugly son of a bitch! "Do you really think that all it takes is just a few words and everything will be forgotten and canceled?" Stay there on the floor! Crawl! Because you're vermin. Prince oderisi, you're full of shit. You're a peacock. You never cared for your daughter. I thought she admired you. She adored you. But I was inside her, provoking her obscene lust. Quick! Felippo! Get the drapery cord, hurry! Ippolita, stop it! Stop that! Steady. Papa! Didn't felippo tell you? My brother and I fucked! That's not true! Oh, yes. Yes, yes, we did fuck. The baby will be your grandchild! Yes, I'm pregnant! You like the idea, you shit-head? Thank god you've arrived. Make her stop! Uncle, save her! Come on! Make up your mind! I'm waiting for you! Uncle. Help me, uncle. Don't treat me they way they do. You can help me, uncle. Don't treat me like a filthy animal. I'm here to help you, my child. Here is the devil! Hey, priest! Show me your Christian charity. The whores had been forgiven by Christ. Don't you also forgive? Because she's a big whore, your ippolita. When she opened her legs to me, you should've seen how she enjoyed it. How long she had waited for it. You don't know her. Look at her. If you were a man, she'd lay you, as well. She would pluck gladly from under your tunic. That innocent little nesting, that never has flown. And so, priest, why don't you dip your limp bird in the holy water, and bless me? Go on! Go ahead. I pray for her, 0 god. Look upon this poor- - I'm not going to leave her young body. It's warm- - bless her and drive out the evil serpent. Be merciful and restore her- - I'll stay within, as long as I want to continue living. O lord, I humbly... The whore's pregnant, did you know that? I impregnated her. I'm waiting for my son! The antichrist. Bless her and drive out the evil serpent. Be merciful, o lord. Restore her to your fold. O lord, I humbly beseech you. Here, priest. You want to communion? This is my body. Are you afraid? You were always afraid. You gave me your niece's soul and I'm not giving it up. Don't you recall that she came to you for help and you denied it? You'll never have her soul, Satan! Never! Hah! And you'll oppose me, is it that? You, with doubts, priest, and your fragile faith? Lord, help us in our hour of need. Give us strength to be triumphant over Satan. We humbly pray. Stop reading that idiocy. You would like to go with me. Join my legions of followers. You're not the first bishop to join Satan. There were thousands before you. Besides, I'll give you all you desire. Poor, weak, miserable old priest! You will not prevail. You could not prevail! It is the will of god, and of Christ, his son! You will be thrown back into the depths! You will not prevail. You'll not prevail! You'll not prevail! You'll not... I am going to destroy you. I'll destroy you, you filthy priest! I'll ask authorization for a formal exorcism. Couldn't you have come to this conclusion before? Exorcism is a procedure. The church needs evidence. Here. Come and sit down. No, no, no. No, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. If you've decided to call in an exorcist, my presence here is absurd. I'm a doctor. I don't perform any miracles. All I hope is that someone will give me my daughter back. Naturally, as a man of science, you have every right to disapprove. I don't make any judgments. Well... Thank you, doctor, for everything. I'm sorry. If I were in your place, I don't know how I would behave. I really don't know. Goodbye. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and... Hello? Yes, ascanio, tell me. Thank you. We all hope so. They've authorized the exorcism. It's in the hands of an Austrian monk called father mittner. He's not in the Abbey now, but they hope to find him as soon as possible, by tomorrow morning, at the latest. I am father mittner. I think you need me. If this has to do with a woman, her right prescribes the presence of one of the family. Better I come. Is she a member of the family? It's as if she were. Good. Then you can help me with the exorcism. Lord! Father eternal! Father omnipotent! Father of our lord Jesus Christ! You who condemned to the fire of gehenna, the traitorous tyrant. And who sent your only son into this world. Lord, terrorize the beast. Terrorize the beast who wasted your vineyards! Give your servant strength! Lord! Destroy the beast that invaded this poor woman. It is this invasion and possession that we want to vanquish. Help us! Protect us! Lead us with your word and your guidance. Inspire us, so that with your teaching and your blessing, we can spread the word of Christ. And Jesus said to his disciples, â€œgo into the world." Go forth and speak to all men. He who believes will be baptized and saved. "He who does not believe will be damned for all eternity." Help me, lord! Help me! Help! Help your unworthy servant! Pardon my sins. Give me strength to fight against this cruel monster! In the name of faith and of Christ, our savior! Who will judge the living and the dead. Behold, the cross of god! Satan, be gone! Behold the cross of god! Satan, be gone! May the lion of the Judah's tribe win, Saint of David! Spirits of the netherworld, in the name of our lord Jesus Christ, I exorcize you! I exorcize you! I exorcize you! In the name of him who cast you out from the highest heavens into the bowels of the earth. He commands you. He who commands the wind, the sea, the tempests! Listen, evil one! Bringer of death! Destroyer of life! Creator of vice! Fount of all greed and evil! Listen, Satan! Evil one, listen! I exorcize you, serpent of hell, for the judge of the living and of the dead! Creator of the world, who has the power to send you to the depths of gehenna! I exorcize you! I exorcize you! I exorcize you! I... Hear him who was sacrificed in Isaac. Sold in Joseph! Killed in the land! Crucified by man! He is last of all triumphant in hell! Go back then, in the name of the father, of the son and of the holy ghost. And thy evil be quenched by the sign of the holy cross of our lord. Who, with his father, and the holy ghost, lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen. Lord, hear my prayer. May my voice rise up to you. May the lord be with you. And with your spirit. You have failed. Satan is stronger than the false Christ! Satan wins! I bless this rain in the name of the father, of the son and of the holy ghost. Amen. O, lord. Hear my prayer. Repel this force which comes from the evil one. Put him to flight. In the name of the creator. In the name of the judge of the living and the dead. In the name of him who overcame you, who cast you out into the fires of gehenna, I exorcize you. No! No! No! The antichrist... Will not be born. Stop those church bells! Stop them from ringing!
