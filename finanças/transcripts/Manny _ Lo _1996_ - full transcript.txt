Have you ever dreamed of a before you met him? As you invented it but did not. These things really happen. Weird, incredible things. I can swear that happen all the time. Wake up. Get up. Is it raining? Sort of. I thought this park. But at night, looks like a park. And we were in Italy, we would be Italian? A could be the French who live in Italy. We enjoy the food and way of life. Yes, but now we're in someone's backyard and I'm starving, so, hurry up. We are French women who die of hunger. Shit. You parked on my lawn. Yes, it's really nice. It is better to remove. No problem. It is better to immediately remove. I told you, all right! I'm sorry for your lawn. What did you say? I've always loved to travel. Manny & Lo - Meninas de Ningu?m - The day when our mother died, Lo hid behind ?ubri?ta car, just in case. That summer, she ran away from her adoptive and somehow I was kidnapped from my own. She said it was her job to save me from such families as the Gordons. I did not think it was so bad, except that I was forced to sleep in the garage. But I'd still rather be with Lo. She's my sister, but a good man. Will? Do You Know What's this for? Thank you. It seems that is not the owner. That's what I thought. Lo, this is true of horses. Really? Really. Go check milk. Lo says that there are familial types of people, and those who are not. It's no good to you if you're wrong. She said that since our mother had was maj?inski type, it means that she and I are naturally independent. Therefore, it is planned to become a flight attendant. And how are you today? - Good. Would you like something to drink, gentlemen? Of course. Luckily she had a natural gift for turbulence. How about you girls? - Move. What? - I have cramps. Have already? - Lo, down. All right. Can I ask you something, I? When are you going to grows out this? We're out. We need to get some more tomorrow. In the car we Rajkar. She did not smell of Rajkar. Yes, you're right, it's not, and you know why, because it smelled like. What's wrong with you? Will you take my side? Really? - Just tonight. Some things, or you notice it or not. As eyelashes, Lo tried without anyone noticing. What are you looking at? It's nothing. So we have persisted for so long. We were just two girls passing by. If you have a car that no one knows, and you know to borrow petrol with the help of hose, you quite some time to travel. Hey, Joey. We just stuck with one rule. Always on the move and will not get caught. Thank you. I did not do it for you. I know, but thank you anyway. I got something for you. What's this? It's a gift for you. Seriously? Open. What's this? That's the blues. Try it. Why? I do not know, I wanted to see how it looks. And how do you think it fits? Probably different. I mean, it's nice. Fuck you, Joey. Why? Why? I did not mean anything by it. Let me, let's go. Wait, where are you going, I'll buy you another one, with a different pattern, druga?e blouse, where are you going? I love you. Hurry up, I want you to practice. We have a new tray. I did not do that tonight. Why? I do not know. Why? Because you're too... - Too what? Are you saying I'm fat? Lo're not fat, but... Okay, I'm fat, ok, I admit, It's not so much a surprise. Read this. What? - This. Mix eggs, sugar, oil, corn syrup... - This is eating every day. The thing is, you can lose weight whenever I want, You just need the will, right? And who has more will than me? No Lo. That's right. Shit. Susie. - Yes. You have not been here by now, right? No, this is my first time. So how is it? Brilliant. - Good. You do not need to test my urine. ?I know what it is. Deal. - I am pregnant. Are. That's why I'm here, to take care of it. What do you think? If sin will come to know when I die, but now I do not have a choice. As I said, I'm pregnant. And you are long gone when you could have something to do. You can give birth tomorrow. Will you do what I ask or not? Sit down to talk. You and he have a lot to catch up on. I'm not here to talk. You know what we need? What? Something in the countryside. Where can we keep before us the hope. And not only so we wander, we need some stability, is not it? Sure. While not complete, and then continue. In which direction to go? I think that way. Sounds good. What if your mom here and tell her about the baby? Since we, as a ghost? No, I think she's still alive. To sit in the back seat. I normally talk to us. What would you do? Depends whether drunk or high. Come on, Lo. How would I know what to do, Me. Why do you always ask stupid questions. You probably would have had a bath. Yeah, probably. How We've been on this trip? Thirteen minutes and 40 seconds. And when we passed the last house? That time. - Surely you see the mailbox for the mail? Sure. Some people privacy seriously. Wait a minute. What if there's anyone? - What are we going to tell them? To sell biscuits. What? ?okoladne? Just go. Is there anyone? It is not locked. You know, I think people live here. But do not currently live. This is the second homes. There will be vra?ati some time. How do you know? See skis? - Yes. Can you see the snow? There is no food in the fridge. And a bunch of cans. Food for the winter. Go check it out beds. Tomorrow we have to get some things that we need. - What? As the book. We must begin to impart. I saw the cat work on. Nine ma?i?a for eight and a half minutes. Not hard to guess. Compared with the other things we do. They could at least introduce cable here. See the tapes that they have. "Orphan". - I was watching. "In the service of love." And that I saw. A "Welcome Tiffany?" - "Welcome Tiffany." I've never heard of. I guess it's not bad. This is Tiffany. Look. See? Lo? Lo? Ugasi?u it. This looks good. There are a lot of pictures. And drawings. Check it out. Can you hear the baby crying in the distance of 200 meters. Try it. Say something, will you? There are three choices for each Use of, or ordinary cloth diapers. Of course, disposable ones are most convenient, but it breaks down, the canvas is much better for the baby... Come on. I said, let's go. Just a second. So if you want ordinary diapers, we have, and there is a kind of... It's beautiful, is not it? Unfortunately babies love to swing right and not to the side. I do not know why they were so right, because if you make sure you can roll over the baby. Honestly, if you like it buy a rocking chair rocker. Thank you. Hello. - Hi. That's all? - Yes. This is for your baby? - Yes. I think you'll also want a pink pedal travel. It's okay, it's better this way. Well, I never made a mistake. Did you see someone that knows so much about babies? Excuse me, I'm Connie, this is my store. Alison. Hi Alison. This is my Aunt Elaine, who helps me when he can and we are very grateful to her. Elaine, I think that Alison wanted yellow. How are you? I'll be back in the morning, Elaine. You might ask her, right? You think you can just take her? So, always take things from the store. It's not funny. Do you want to go to the hospital to arrest me or I die? I do not want to get arrested or to perish. Okay, with that we have already taken. I'm sorry we're closed, you need to you to come tomorrow. I can not. Do you know what you need? Yes. - All right then, come on. How can I help? - Others need my cradle. We have two types of cribs, there she was with stuffed animals and here we have... - Whoa, this is a rifle. Put your hands in the air. I'm serious, hands in the air. Me, is greater. Stop mumbling hell. I mean it, do not spray it. And legs. Take the card. Any. Write to the sick and went to France... No, do not write it. Can... Dear friends I need a break, like you Elaine. Okay, come on. If you think you'll take this money, terribly wrong. I do not need your money. What do you need? Let me, let's go. Go see what he's doing, I'll be careful. Elaine... I hope you slept well. I'll let you music. Some people like music while you are sleeping. Or when they are awake when they are bored or neraspolo?ni. My sister wanted to know if you're okay. Please tell your sister that I have a lot of relatives and friends with every day views. No one will understand my absence for granted. I'm the one for you should be worried. Please pass on this. Okay. - Thank you. She is... - I heard what she said. Lo. Elaine, hello. View Elaine. I'm an alien. Let Elaine, smile. I still do not eat. Take a spoon and feed it. I've already tried that. I think that the hunger strike. What? Hunger-strike. Lo? Lo. There you go. Do not discount the criminals, regardless of whether a drug or religious rituals, or whatever, do not give up criminals. Okay, then die. I'm not going on holiday, ever. It is generally known. You have to sleep sometimes. I can not believe I listened to the rest. I said I was sorry. I did not know. Go check the bathroom has already been there. Still she needs in 15 seconds. How does that leaves combination? Around 22000 OK, check the twice daily. All right. That's your responsibility. All right. - I'll tell me when it is time to change the locks. When it comes to the 15-20 may. And do not let her see that checking. Let's not think that will work. Give her the feeling that something is achieved. It's okay. So, are you going to relax a bit. Maybe he'll relax if you talk to her. You explain her situation. First, let it cool down and then I'll talk to her? When you understand who's the boss. I think we should immediately talk to her. Well, you're the boss, right? Is this yours? Thank you. You live here? Yes, this is my room, this is my fortress, This is my bike there next room. What is your name? Do you? Ben, but you can call me Even. And why not Ben? Nothing, I like it Even. Take one. Was signed. I'm Tiffany. Where do you live, Tiffany? This is your mom? - Yes. The real juice laid. I said I was in that mood and makes me such a shock. It was weird. What? Well I am currently so in the mood. Really? - Yes. It was weird. Maybe I can stay. They're coming my relatives. - I like cousins. Probably not enough. I need to add some more things. Will you come over tomorrow? No it's fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Whatever. Take care. Where have you been? - Nowhere. You did not talk to anybody, right? - No. You did not do anything stupid? - No. It is better not. Let's get some food but I'll be back sooner than you think, so do not try anything. There are no houses in the vicinity and the road has at least five miles, is it me? Four and a half. And broken glass everywhere around the house, I show her what you got. There are all shoes that are in the house. What else? You also have things that can serve as the shoes if you're really desperate. Bucket on the floor if you need it. Come on. Now, if you want to stop a hunger strike. And if you want to listen to music, and... I do not know it seems like a bad idea to me. You're not gonna to keep the baby. There's no way to keep the baby. Then you have to choose someone. And that family on the ground? They look ok. Do you think they are ok. I think you're sick. What about them is wrong? See how mother rocked her ass every time the ball is hit. Do you think these people you can trust? There are two or three mothers out there that are not so bad and if you will not already choose to pick a bad one. Shit. Here Connie. Is Elaine there? Who is this? Barbara. Who? Barbara, her friend. Sorry Barbara, Elaine is not here. Really? Do you know where it is? She is on vacation. Hello? Do you know when will you be back? I do not know if you're her new friend? No. - Lf you were not in church? - No. Do you think you can hear her? I do not know. If you hear give her a message from me, will you? Of course. Tell her that this job has a lot of financial cost and that I am personally responsible for them. I can not afford to tell people do unpredictable, even relatives, not that I do not have to understand it, and I have... Get in the car. How do you know that ozvu?en? I know, because I was screwed, I know that. Do not drive so zgnje?i?e? baby. Why we parked here? Be quiet until you get to safety. Shit. Stop it. God, you're pregnant. Jesus, the porodi?e?. Why do you think you're here? Rodi?e? boy. What? I said it was a boy. I have never made a mistake. Why smoke when you're pregnant? What do you think it is? I have no idea. It's called a hot meal and eating it. Not for touching. I think that kidnapping victims are entitled to a meal like everyone else. And if I'm not mistaken, the same is true for the innocent babies. If you two do not agree with it, I can not help you. It's good. You know Connie? My niece? Yes. Why is not she wearing that uniform for nurses like you? Connie is a good woman, but there is no such experience. Are you there? It's a nursing home. I worked many medical tests while my father was there. Why not wear the same uniform as the other sisters? I was not formal. What? I got in the house other photos and I hope you'll respect my right to privacy. Even if you hold me against my will. Can I get this file? Pardon? Can I get this file? Please. Well, you can. For now. - Thank you. Amanda, two things I want to tell you. The first is that crime does not pay. And second, I can'd feel good about this kidnapping as many people have suffered because of it not just me. But I think you're a beautiful young lady. Really? Thank you. Who is it? - Loreal... and Amanda. Come. Like I can not breathe, and has shot more. No, he turned. Maybe hiccup. - Shut up, I talk to Elaine. Vida've done it before. Is that bad? Could be. - What do I do? Put your head. Come on. Put your elbows on your knees. Like that? That's it. Okay, Amanda tell me when you sell exactly twelve minutes. It's going to be ten and thirty four. I'll put the water for tea. So, how is Lo? I think it's working. I'll be in the next room if you need me. Hey, thank you Elaine. You're welcome, Loreal. So, when will it happen? - I'll have some more to cook. I hope they come out earlier. Loreal, there's nothing worse and more dangerous than prevremenske pregnancy. A woman should be Porada while he can. And how is it done? Well, first he wants to stop it. What else? To avoid certain things that cause. - What things? Za?injenu food, long showers, soda, closely underwear, dancing... No dancing? Especially do not play rock and roll. Damn, and I was just in the mood to play. Go get your sister a glass of water. Did you hear me? She stopped at 14-39 since Saturday. You probably did something wrong. No, I swear. Listen just because this lately does not mean we should discount. Maybe you prefer to stay with us. Did you ever think of that? To stay with us? You mean that crazy? No. Then we specify a reason why someone like her wanted to stay with us? It is better to check the numbers again. You have no family, Elaine? Some people have a gift but are unable to use it. Sometimes should not wait until their body becomes used up to the present. Do you understand? No, not really. When I was younger, I could not physically have a baby, my emotional side, how to say... It was hard. It's hard? I was like everyone else, but now I feel much better. This is good. There are many ways to give a gift, not just one. And not just the obvious. Does that make sense? Yes. There is. Amanda, can you nurse to add water? Of course. I do not want her back legs swell. Fill to me. Thank you. Have you checked the numbers again? Administration are still trying to escape. I told you. Have you noticed how some crazy not believe someone who does not wear a chain of Articles? There has been such. Elaine, I knew that. Whatever, but I did not care, why should they? Elaine. Sister-sleep. I brought you something. Hypnotized him. Eight minutes. It was very thoughtful. Go and wash. Lo, get up. Lo. Lo, get up. Okay, what is it? What the hell? Out of 475 00:54:29,360... > 00:54:31,120 It's nothing. He's a good feeling, is not it? What? A nice long shower. That's right. It is better to obu?e?. I let my sister to sleep, we'll have dinner later. Carefully Amanda, that's hot. With mushrooms. I'm sorry. Are you all right, Elaine? I'm fine. What is it? Just thinking. - About what? Well, if you ever thought of how all this might take? How can we stay in this house? No, not really. Well, that explains it. What explains? It's nothing. What explains this? Well, it seems that people in your position, would prefer that they move, instead of sitting in the same place for weeks as ducks. As targets. Thank you, Amanda. As there is no process of elimination. You say we should go from here? Well, I do not make the decisions. It's your show, right? You know, I think that's right. I think I should go from here. Wait a minute. Did a lot of people asking, Elaine? It's a silly question. Do you? Of course. My group from the church, I was in charge of the coffee, you know? Remember, one reason why you have not found? I'll tell you why, because this is the hiding place for the killer. Do not I know you? You think I'm stupid? Yes, healing very nicely. Clear. Can I ask you something? Yes, of course. She is interested in the true nature of your visit here. Well, this is my house. Yes, I'm just curious, if you are going to join someone else? I came here to be alone for a while. Really? I need space from time to time. My family knows that. Well, I think we need to concentrate on each other, in order to survive. Have you seen these guys? They do not. You odvla?i? attention to them until the run. I'll go to a pay phone and call the sheriff, will come soon, my acquaintance. He will come soon, I promise. So? I think it's a very interesting plan. I razmisli?u about him. What are you doing? Why do not you untie? No, what you do, what do you do? I do not understand why you were not able to stay home with your family? What? Hello. You know it's all a lot of glass? Yeah, I know. What can you play? Hide, have you heard of that game? It looks like he's angry. Or just weird. It seems odd, but it has that special gift. What a gift? - Designate a gift that certain people have. You want it? No, thank you. Tonight we have a weird juice if you want to drop by. That's okay, we have a hot meal. You will not tell anyone about him? I still have my picture? - Yes. Maybe I'll drop by tomorrow. Yes, you may. Take care. Are you going to Elaine? Loreal thought we'd stop smoking. We will. I'm sorry. I wish I did not sit in that chair. Why? I would not sit. Lo, do not sit in that chair. Are we going to sing? No, we'll talk. We'll talk about serious things, about the future. You know Elaine certain before we lived a life that does not tolerate baby even that we want and do not want it. I do not mind. - I do not start. I've been thinking a lot... What's this? - I'm talking about. I thought it was stupid to give her child hostage, but you're like most people, Elaine, I see it now. You are overcome frown. You have the knowledge, medical experience and not only that, you're right. Who the hell is this? You're supposed to take his shoes Elaine. Can I ask you a question, Elaine? Have you ever heard of the hostage taken hostage? She was only trying to help. What kind of crazy person would do that? Well, we just did it. It's not the same to me, Do not you see that it should be different than us. You probably never had children. I do not understand, just helped. - I guarantee it's not a nurse. Out of the car-what? I mean it out of the car. Lo stop, stop. Damn, Lo. - What did you say? I said, damn. Do you want you to go out, do you want? Who are you with me, with me or her? Do not you want to sit in front? No, thank you. Let me stop, you can not sleep here. Listen I'm sorry that it turned out like that, but it is. And better for what I have now realized, so we have time to come up with something. - Stop playing. What? I told you to stop that play. Who's playing, I'm freezing. Play and looks like a rock, and You'll get contractions and so cut. Who told you that to me? No one has said that. And who is out asshole? But it should not stop you playing. Stop Lo. I mean it, stop it please. You'll get contractions, please stop. Stop it. Get up, come on. I told you to stand up. It's still early. So? What is it? Nothing. You look like you've swallowed a fly. - Well, I'm not. Give me five minutes, then come in... - I will not go into. What? I said I will not go in to. Crime does not pay. Damn me and you gave her our food. Okay, sit here and act like an ass, but watch out for the cops. Lo, where are you? What are you doing? - Did you see the cops? - Yes. Did he see you? - Yes. - Shit. On what are you standing? - On the crates. - Are there others? A few. - Line them up. You want to eat? Why do you keep looking at your stomach? You have cramps, right? Got them from last night? No ovako. -Did not I tell you not to play like that last night. Did not I say... - Shut up, please. What are you doing? Look I do not want to get arrested because of me, But the cops know medicine will die if I do not. We're not going until they come. Lo, we can not stay. Now will come. It was already half an hour. The policeman saw me. He saw, too. - I know. Do you think that we are now not after? No. No? I think no one is chasing, never. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. Will die in the middle of the damn time in this damn car. You're not. I do not want to die to me. Elaine, I am. I thought you were never going to come. Neither do we. - Do you know how dangerous these roads? A radio does not work on more than two hundred meters. I did not deserve what your sister did. It was a terrible thing and I did not deserve it. We know. We're sorry. We? Yeah, me and Lo. We're sorry. You'll be fine, look who's here. Tell her you're sorry. I'm sorry. She said. Can you help? Excuse me for a moment. I'll give my best. It should not take much, does it? Okay, I'm going to stop, and falsehoods will leave presta?u right? Lo, look at me. Look at me. You're not going anywhere, do you understand me? You're not going anywhere, and I, I'll stay here and rodi?e? this baby. Do you believe me? Do you trust me? Then stop resisting. Push. I think you should pick it up. Elaine Damn, he's really a boy. Well, Amanda, we have a long road Your sister will certainly be busy, but I would like it u?ini? something. What's this? I'd like to write a story of 500 words or more about certain lessons that are learned. Lessons? - O hostages. How? As soon as we set up, and I intend to write one. Well, if you're gonna be'd feel better about that, Elaine. I believe I will. Okay, fasten all. You sure know how to drive, Elaine? Loreal, what kind of question is that?
