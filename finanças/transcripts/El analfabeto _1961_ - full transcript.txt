[triumphant music playing] NOTARY PUBLIC The letter is ready, sir. Read it to me. "Mr. Inocencio Prieto y Calvo, 7 Corralón Street, St. Hilarion the Great. Our dear sir--" "My dear sir." Whatever. "I hereby inform you that your uncle, Mr. Prisciliano Calvo y Velludo, has passed away in Falfurrias, Texas, on the 24th of last month, bequeathing to you--" Two million. Precisely. "Two million pesos, which you will acquire upon receipt of this letter, submitting baptismal certificate as proof that you are his rightful heir. Please, contact this notary public to this effect. Yours sincerely," et cetera. Have you asked what state that village is in? Well, I'd presume it's in an appalling state, sir. I was referring to the state within the republic. Oh, yes, sir. It is in Guanajuato, a neighborhood in Guanajuato. [bells tolling] [man whistling] [man 1] Inocencio! How can I assist? Bring me a box of 3-inch nails. With or without? Without. Quickly. Here you are. And the nails? You said "without." Without head. I thought without nails. You should specify. Inocencio! Yes, master? Bring me some red cedar boards. It'll be made out of pine and green. Not refined. Whatever, but hurry! They'll wave down. [man 2] Inocencio! At your service. Heat up the glue and stir it. You're a nuisance with the glue. Stir the glue. This glue is more than stirred, man. It is just right, just right. - [man 3] Inocencio. - Tell me, sir. Have you finished the coffin? Yes, sir. In weeping-willow wood, to suit the mourners. And is it fitting? Yes, but it'll fit the corpse best. Well... It is time for you to be more than praiseworthy. But my merits are evident. Just come and see. [comical music playing] But what's this? Why, it is the coffin you asked me to craft. The packing makes you feel like dying. But from rage. Are these the measurements I gave you? Well, the figures were a bit blurred, so I made it by estimation. Estimation. Well, I knew the deceased. Rather large-headed, big belly. So, it's capacious here, so he can feel comfy, as if he was in a sarcophagus, Egyptian-style. He'll feel like a pharaoh, and he'll rest better. It has no nails, since, you know, a prick like that, even on a numb body, can be a nuisance. He has a zipper, so if he needs air, or feels suffocated, he opens his zipper, and the air blows in. Like at a picnic. No tight things. No, no, no. Why would he want air? What do you mean, sir? We can't squash him in there forever. Let him have some fresh air. This is what I get for hiring people who can't read or write. I may not read nor write, but you sure do exploit me. Lift up boards, put down boards, bring nails, stir up glue. You've used me as your ass. And you even want me to build tailor-made coffins, man. If you don't like it, you may walk out. I will when I receive my back pay, instead of criticism, for a change. Here's 100 pesos and quit arguing! You're arguing. A hundred pesos for two weeks. Who'll pay for the nails I bought on credit? I will, so hit the road. One hundred pesos. Who else can make a coffin like that, Egyptian-style? Just to criticize a person, good wood, estimated dimensions. Who else would finish it like that? If the body moves, it is tight. If it doesn't, it is happy there. Well, that's enough! My goodness. Ooh. Ooh. [bells chiming] - Who is it? - [woman] It's me. Come on in. Good morning, Epifanita. Good morning. Are you done with my laundry? It's done. That's your basket. How much is it? Whatever is your will, Doña Chona. Would 5 pesos be all right? [chuckles] I'd say it was more, but anything will do. Ah. Thank you very much. Okay, see you next week. Please, see yourself out. - [woman] How are you? - You first, Doña Chonita. [tender music playing] What's up, Godmother? What happened to you, my son? You're never home so early. Got planked down at the carpenters. - What? - Don Leoncio fired me. - How come? - Well, we had a technical argument about corpse-like measurements, as to whether the deceased was too big for the coffin or the coffin was too small for the deceased. - So, I left it like that. - The coffin? No, the argument. [exclaims] And what will you do now? We need those cents so badly. Don't you worry. These hundred pesos they owed me will last a few days, and I can always find a better job. I don't want to spend my whole life as a woodpecker, do I? God willing. Especially St. Joseph, the carpenter. Yes. Hang up these clothes, and I'll fix you something to eat. Yes, Godmother. Wow, these clothes are dirtier than before. [humming] [bells chiming] - May I? - Come on in. Who are you looking for? Just you. I have some registered mail for you. Are you sure? Yes, it is clearly stated here, "Mr. Inocencio Prieto y Calvo." - I need your signature. - What for? It's the proof that you received the letter. - So, I have to sign? - Of course. You know, my fingers have been a little numb lately. I think it's rheumatism. And it gets worse each day. So, I cannot sign. What a coincidence. My leg sometimes goes numb, too. But at your age, everything gets numb. I suppose you might be able to draw a cross. A cross, yes. For a cross, it goes un-numb. - A crossed cross? - Yes, a cross. - A cross. - Yes, a cross. A little stick here. - And another across it. - Exactly. - There you are. - Well, here's the letter. Thanks. See you around. See you, Gutierritos. I got a letter just like milk. Like milk? Certified. I don't know who sent it. And is it for you? Well, if this scribble means my name. - Hey, was my dad a Prieto? - [exclaims] Real Prieto. Sometimes he even glimmered. No, I mean, his last name. Yes. You are Prieto on your father's side, and Calvo on your mother's. Such a name I got. Then I guess it is indeed for me. Let's see if I can figure out what it says. [groans] Well, no, I can't understand a word. No, and the other words even less. I think this is written in Russian or French. Even if it was in English... If I only knew who sent it. As far as I know, your only relative is your Uncle Prisciliano, a brother of your father. And he can write? He was the only one in the family who was into studying. And what for? Twenty years later, he went off as a laborer to the United States, and we never heard a word from him again. Maybe it's from my Uncle Chano. Don't dream of it. I can assure you that if he's alive, he doesn't remember he has a nephew. You know who can read it to you? Don Diego, the man at the drugstore. Oh, that's right. I will go right now to sort out this quiz. Hey, but aren't you going to eat? This is more important. I'll be right back. - Thank you, Don Diego. - You're welcome. [bells tolling] - Hello, Don Diego. - Hello, Inocencio. What brings you here? I brought myself, actually. If it's not much trouble, I need a favor from you. Yes, of course. I'll be with you in a second. - Hello, Lupita. - Could you provide us with this? Yes, of course. But where have I left my spectacles? I can read it for you. - [Diego] You can read already? - [Lupita] And very well. [Diego] Is that right? Let's see. "A pack of cotton, two porous patches and a bottle of cherry syrup." Very good, dear. You deserve a candy. - Chucho, get what the girl asked for. - [Chucho] Yes, doctor. It is a pleasure to see such a little girl read fluently. - She learned very fast. - [Diego chuckles] And what is it you need, Inocencio? Well, I actually forgot what it was. Oh, yes, do you have mustard poultices? Yeah. - Hey, so little and she can read. - Yes. So, remember, madam, school starts on Monday at 8. Thank you. Do I have to pay anything? Not at all. Not that we don't need it, but tuition is and must be free in every official school. Thank you, teacher. Come on, darling. [man] Next. Where is the child you want to enroll? Well, you know, that child is me. Speak louder. I can't hear you. The child is me. [all laughing] - Silence! - [bell rings] What do you mean? I'm ashamed to admit it, but you see, I can't read or write. Hmph. Is that so? Yes, I got a letter today, and I still don't know what it says. If you want, I can... No. I made up my mind that no one will read it for me. It's not because it's important. It might even be somebody asking for money. Then why? I am ashamed that a stranger could know of my private affairs, due to my lack of knowledge because I can't read, due to my ignorance. As a punishment, I put upon myself, I won't know its content until I read it myself and get rid of the ignorance that is only damaging me. [all laughing] Silence! What this man has said is no reason to laugh, sirs. On the contrary. What our friend here intends to do is truly praiseworthy. It is never too late to learn. And history has examples of people who became celebrities, even though by their 30s, they could not read or write. Who can say that our friend here, who is today nothing but a poor illiterate, should not be called to take on an important position within our society? I think you're exaggerating. No, not at all. Motivation can take you quite far. And your determination not to know what the letter says until you can read it yourself, uh, may be the beginning of a promising career. Well, if you say so, I will get there. And although my class is quite full, there will always be a place for you. That's enough for me, teacher. - What's your name? - Inocencio Prieto y Calvo. What shift do you prefer: morning or afternoon? As for me, I would take both, to catch up and work hard, but I need to work, so I'd rather pick the afternoon one. Fine, then. I hope to see you starting next Monday. I will surely be here. I will give you the alphabet, so you can get acquainted with the letters. - Thank you, teacher. - [chuckles] - See you on Monday. - See you on Monday. God be with you, son. Next. [peaceful music playing] We bumped, didn't we? It was my fault. I was unfocused-- It was mine because I was focused on my reading. You're not local. You're an outsider? I just arrived. I'm looking for Rómulo González's house. - The bank manager? - Yes. This is his address. You can read it yourself. - I guess I can't. - You can't? There is no need because I know his house well. So, you can guide me to it. If I guide you, you'll get lost because the streets are like a maze. Each day we discover a new alley. I'd better go with you. If it's not much trouble. On the contrary. It's a host's duty to assist tourists. - Thank you very much. - Allow me. [sighs] Your flowers are beautiful, Aníbal. Next to you, though, they look ugly. You say such nice things. Good afternoon, Aníbal. Good afternoon, madam. Look, Mom, what beautiful flowers. Mmm! You're always such a gentleman. And you're always so kind, Doña Refugio. It's almost 3, and that girl hasn't arrived. We could have picked her up at the station. She couldn't get lost with the address on paper. Waiting for somebody? A young lady who will do the housekeeping and keep Ofelia company. That sounds good to me, madam. [piano playing] Did you see the new piano my dad bought me, Aníbalito? As soon as I came in. [chuckles] Play something for your fiancé. If he asks me to. I beg you, Ofelia. Would you like a nocturne? Coming from your beautiful hands, even a diurnal would please me. [chuckles] [playing tranquil music] So, your mom worked at Mrs. González's home? Yes, many years ago, until she got married and moved. My father died recently, and she asked Mrs. González if I could work for her. I'm both sorry and pleased, since if that had not happened, what might happen here would not happen, would it? - [chuckles] - This is the house. Thank you very much for your kind company. You're welcome, miss. Uh, if it's not asking too much, would you mind me visiting you again sometime? [sighs] If you want to. What a silly thing to say. I just realized I don't know your name. Blanca. What a pretty name. So pure and spotless. And what's yours? Well, mine is not very spotted either. It's Inocencio. Inocencio? Oh, it sounds nice. And once I carry out what I have in mind, it'll sound much better. Well, see you soon, Inocencio. See you soon, Blanquita. [doorbell rings] We were all very fond of your mother. [Blanca] She also remembers you very dearly. I hope Ofelia and you become good friends. Yes, madam, of course. Mr. Aníbal Guzmán. He is Miss Ofelia's fiancé. Come, I'll show you your room. - Would you excuse us? - Go ahead, madam. May I, Don Rómulo? Come in, Gorgonio. - A man here wants to speak to you. - Who is he? I only know his name is Inocencio. I hardly know him. Mm-hm. What does he want? He said it was confidential. Confidential? Well, let him in. - You take care of these documents. - Yes, sir. Here is the person. May I compenetrate? Please, come in. [door closes] You want to talk to me? Yes, I wanted to talk privately, just us. With no one spying on us. You know how gossip starts rolling. Leave us alone, Fermín. Have a seat. What is it about? You know that Blanca has arrived? Blanca who? The young lady your wife was expecting. Oh, yes. Josefina's daughter. Josefina who? Well, Blanca's mother. The one who became a widow when her husband died? Well... And is this why you asked to speak confidentially? No, I just wanted to show you that I'm efficient and well-informed. But the main subject is another one. Oh, all right. You're not to know, and I'm not to tell, - but today I was stirring the glue... - For the fun of it? No, at the carpentry shop of that exploiter Don Leoncio. You mean, you work there? I used to work there. Because you know Don Leoncio. He got mad at me, about this and that, and I told him: "We are to speak in business terms, not like that. To avoid conflict, we had better end our association, due to unaccountability, okay?" Very interesting. That's why I came, to exchange opinions, and find out if you could give me a job in this banking, financing negotiation of yours. Mm-hm. And what kind of a job would you like? As an accountant, a cashier? Not as a cashier. I used to do the coffins, but an accountant would do. That may work. I used to make stories count. Do you know the one about the sailor parakeet? - The parakeet yelled, "Land!" - No. - Then the sharks came and... - No, no. - Sharks on sight. - Don't go on, please. It's new. I was speaking in banking terms. But you don't know a promissory note. But I do know a promising note. And I don't want to keep promising, so I came to work it out. This is the confidential part. I don't know if... - But you seem to be a very kind person. - Speak up. - As you see me here, I'm very ashamed... - Come on. As you see me here, I can't read or write. You don't say. You would never tell. Judging by my looks, I could be a writer or a scientist, but no. So, what position would you like? An easy one, like maintenance combined with errands. And every now and then, I can feed your fish. Are you honest? For sure. I hope you are, too. Since we'll be working together, there should be a certain trust. A reciprocity. I'm the bank manager. That's why. It's rare for a banker to know about honesty. But there are always exceptions. Well, since you asked for it so well, and I was looking for a trustworthy man, you may start working on Monday. Why not tomorrow? It's Saturday, and we don't work. That's not a problem. I can work any day. Yes, I'm sure you can. What will my schedule be? You'll start at 6 a.m., so by opening time, the cleaning is done. That's very early. But it's all right. And the closing time? At 3 p.m., you may leave. That's good. It gives me time to go to night school. - Do you go to school? - I start on Monday. Very good. That is one more reason for you to earn my respect. Is that all I'll earn? I forgot about that. That's why I'm here, to remind you. - [intercom crackles] - [Fermin] Yes, Don Rómulo? Come to my office, Fermín. Is 100 pesos a week all right? Two hundred would be better. But I'm not greedy, so 100 is fine to start with. Tell me, sir. Mr. Inocencio is our new errand man and janitor. Although he is still illiterate, he's full of goodwill. Brief him on all matters, so he can start on Monday. Very well, sir. Would you follow me? See you on Monday, Don Rómulo. - And thank you very much. - You are welcome. So, you got a job at the bank? Yes, and I thought I was going to be the errand boy. - And? - Well, they hired me as vice boy. - And what's that? - Well, I'm not quite sure. It must be important, almost like a vice president, because they were impressed by my personality. What good luck! Some days start off badly, but then they improve. I got a letter, and it's as if I hadn't because I don't know what it says. How come? You still haven't got it read? No, but it seems it gave me luck. God willing, son. It seems so. I got a job at the bank, Don Cosme signed me up at school, and on top of that, I think I got on a boat. - What's that? - I almost got a girlfriend. Take advantage of tomorrow's feast of our town's virgin, to go to church, and after singing to Our Lady, you can thank her for all the blessings and ask that she never release your hand. I have to go anyway because, as they say, I'm the spirit of the choir. Of course, without your angel voice, that choir would sound un-angelic. Get some rest now. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, Godmother. [sighs, then clears throat] [clears throat] [singing in Spanish] [organ playing church music] [singing "Hallelujah" in Spanish] [bells tolling] [man] A penny for the love of God. A penny for this poor blind man. A penny for the love of God. A penny for the love of God. A penny for this poor blind man. A penny for the love of God. A penny for this poor blind man. A penny for the love of God. A penny for this poor blind man. Hold this for a second. Don't you steal it. [comical music playing] You got us a job? I can't see the time. You can't see anything. It's not a job. It's about serenading a girl I am interested in. - Do we know her? - Who's the victim? No victim. She's a very decent girl. From a good family. Grab your instruments. Which one shall we rehearse? We will play something like... Well... Something romantic. Something heavenly? Something earthy, smelling of fresh earth, just like she does. Remember that piece that starts in three-four time, very romantic, which goes: ♪ I got in my soul ♪ ♪ An immense desire ♪ - Do you remember? - Let's see if we do. What key is it, G major? How can it be G major if it's a nocturne, a serenade? G major. We'll do it in C minor, slowly. Since you are the brass, you'll go on nocturnal pizzicato. - Just pizzicato. - With an introduction? Of course. I won't come in with my voice to impress her. With introduction and all. Are you ready? [playing out of rhythm] Just a moment, young fellows. What's that? Aren't you ashamed? Have you no feelings? Don't you vibrate with the music, the art, the harmony, man? But the piece is in a waltz rhythm, and you're marking a rock 'n' roll rhythm. I mark as I please because I'm the director of the group. You can't talk because I learned at a reservatory, and you play by ear. You can't hear, nor see, nor play. You want to be a soloist. But I'm tired. Do you think Beethoven didn't get tired? All the great geniuses got tired. They studied. They were unperishable. They took what they got. And as they took it, they started being. What a lack of ethics, of professionalism, of a sense of responsibility. Gosh, man. Really, what have I tried to teach you all this for? We'll come in all together, and we'll come out as we may. - [man] And where do we meet? - Wherever we can. Let's start. [playing out of rhythm] ♪ I want to make for you ♪ ♪ A pearl necklace ♪ ♪ With my tears ♪ ♪ And let me cry ♪ ♪ As today I lost you ♪ ♪ The more I try to forget you ♪ ♪ I remember ♪ ♪ You the more ♪ [music stops] And now beat it. What follows doesn't need any accompaniment. Lovely song. I would've been better, but those fools ruined it. Really? To prove how interested I am in you. Though by tomorrow, the whole town will know. I'm afraid so. Shouldn't be afraid. I'm here to take responsibility, as a gentleman should. No doubt. I know that when the time comes, you'll face it. Sure, though every time I do it, my face gets broken, but I stay steady. By the way, you still haven't told me what you do for a living. Well, there was no mutual closeness. You see, my business so far has been wood. Fine wood, right? Export, import. First-class wood, estimations, refined wood. As they say, a big business, more like a black market. Then I decided to change course, and now I'm into banking issues, uh, financing, credit, where there is some future ahead. How long have you been in this? I've been thinking about it for a long time, but I'll start working on Monday. Ah. This is something with a future. It is, as they say, a matter of class and of connections and... You know. [bell chiming] I must go. They're calling me. Eh, Blanquita, would you mind if I come in my spare time to visit you? No. Otherwise, you could write to me. - [bell chiming] - No, I'd rather come and visit you. So would I. Okay, see you soon, Blanquita. Good night, Inocencio. [bell chiming] Please, don't bother. It's no problem, sir. Let Blanca see you out. - Were you calling me? - Often enough. We wanted more coffee. Now escort the gentleman and then lock the door. Yes, madam. At your service, madam. - Good night. - Good night. Come on, lady, don't be foolish. Let go of me or I'll scream. You weren't so skittish with that dope by the church stairs. He's a decent man. He's a poor, ravenous man. You sure would wish to be like him. Now go away or I'll tell Miss Ofelia. All right, all right, Blanquita. I can wait. [chuckles] [dramatic music playing] [peaceful music playing] Did you oil the machine? Yes, I used castor oil plant. So, it'll loosen up. - Castor oil? - Yes, but see how well it's working. Here are the assets. And here the liabilities. The assets still need some adjusting. [man] Inocencio! Tell me. Have you swept the filing room? What firing room? - Filing! - I'll do it tomorrow. Inocencio! Don't yell at me. I'm not deaf. Tell me. Hand me that cloth. Now polish my shoes. What do you mean? Do I look like a shoeshine boy? "Polish my shoes." First you need half soles, then shoes. These look like slippers. Aren't you ashamed to come in slippers? I'll teach you respect. You should give respect first, to receive respect. Inocencio. Get me some cigars. - What brand? - Filtered Fumarolas. I mean, what brand is your watch? Have a look. My day is almost over. So, what's the hurry? I don't want to get a "lack of unpunctuality" at school. I'm doing well. - Are you making progress? - A little. I got an eight in botany, a nine in gym, 7.5 in singing, because I missed the high note. But I'm doing bad in math. I can't get the Roman numerals. Since you have an Italian look and you are a go-getter, why don't you give me a hand? If she gives you a hand, you'll learn fast. [all laughing] Rodriguez, Agustín. I'm here, teacher. - Silverio Perez. - [all] Olé. What do you mean, "olé"? Silverio Perez. - I'm here, teacher. - Take a seat. Inocencio Prieto Calvo. Is he not here? I'm here, teacher. - Good afternoon, children. - [all] Good afternoon. Teacher, I'm late because I stayed with the manager, exchanging opinions on foreign currency matters, and it got late. Since the reason is so commendable, you are excused. Thank you, teacher. Do you remember yesterday's lesson? Yes, teacher, of course. Letters are not equal to each other, since some of them are not equal to the others, and the others differ from them, right? Well, yes, continue. Eh, in the light of this matter, we also have capital letters and lowercase letters. Capital letters are the ones that are big. The lower ones, due to lack of vitamins, that is literary undevelopment, they remain little ones, right? Yes, more or less. Well, give it more than less, teacher. Also, to finish this lecture-emulating situation, we've got-- We find this phenomenon which can be a grammatical one, but which is about the same situation we were talking about before, we've got vowels and inconsonants. Perfect. Can you name a vowel? I can name one or all of them in a row, for you to see who you are talking to: E, I, O, U, A. No, no, no. A, E, I, O, U. Well, I'm surprised, teacher, since the order of the factors does not alter the alphabet. Why, you have impressed me. You've impressed me more, for these are high-school questions. - Have you done your homework? - Here it is. Please, show it to me. Here. The difference is that I'm an orphan, so my parents didn't do it. I had to do it myself. Excellent. Let's see. - Let's see... - [shocking music playing] - I see nothing here. - Neither do I. The fact is, the paper absorbs everything, since it's wrapping paper. Then the ink is watery. And the lights went off. And some kind of stain fell, which, if you look at it closely, is something somewhat abstract, like a painting by Picasso, or whatever they call him. But if you look carefully, the shape takes the form of a boat. [all laughing] Silence! I forbid you to laugh again at a schoolmate who is speaking with such goodwill and has such a thirst for learning. That's right. I spend the whole night studying. Did you hear? In his desire to learn, he spends sleepless nights. With tallow candles, the worst ones. Yesterday, without electricity, I lit up a tallow candle. And with it dripping, and the O you told me to draw real round, I don't know why, but as much as I tried, - it came out in the shape of an egg. - [boys laugh] Are you listening? You don't know what a sacrifice it is to work during the day, come to school in the evening, and then spend the nights studying. [scoffs] These kids. These kids. Starting today, I will give you the paper and the ink you need to do your homework properly. Thank you very much. [peaceful music playing] But you still haven't found out what the letter says? I'm working on it. It just takes time. But what I can tell you is that it has lots of small letters, the lowercase letters, and the capital letters, which are the ones with the suspensory points. [exclaims] No one can say you have not made a lot of progress, son. That's right, Godmother. - [bell chiming] - Who can it be at this hour? - Good evening, Doña Epifanita. - Good evening. - Is Inocencio in? - What for? We only came to say hello. - He is studying. - I told you so. Can we see him? - Come this way. - Let's go. But don't distract him. No, madam, don't worry. Hello, Inocencio. Why did you let in this bunch of uncultivated and illiteratical vagrants? These what? I said, illiteratical. You may leave us, Godmother. I'm off to darn your clothes. Tell us what "illiteratical" means. "Illiteratical" means... Well, it's the mythology of the word. But illiteratical are the ones who don't even know their names. I'm not that. I know I'm called the Frog. I'm the Blondie. - I'm the Sightless. - I'm the Goat. You see, you don't know. Those are your appellations. What is an appellation? You are indeed unlearned. Totally lacking in agriculture. "Appellation," the word indicates it. Appellations are names used by apelike guys like you. What? Your names are Nicandro, Isidro, Nicanor, and Dalmiro. Hearing you talk, I even feel like learning to read. "Feel like..." Why don't you enroll at my school? - When? - We work all day. Why don't you teach us since you know so much? - Fine, but on one condition: - [Nicanor] What? That, in class, I'm not Inocencio or "Hey." I'm "teacher." As you wish, buddy. What did you say, sassy? Whatever you say, teacher. That's different. So, come here tomorrow to start receiving the pedagogics you need. We'll be here as one man. Not one. I want all four of you here. And don't bring me... oranges, or apples, or bananas, or sisters' messages to wheedle a ten from me. You'll study or you'll fail and won't pass the year. Yes, sir. And you have breakfast before coming. All right. - And wash your hands. - All right. Until tomorrow, Inoce-- Teacher. Until tomorrow. Bye, ma'am. Bye, teacher. [tender music playing] Why don't you lie down, my son? I have to keep on studying, so as to soon be in a position in which I can propose to Blanquita. You still think that girl is for you? Of course, Godmother. Since I first met her, she's become like a dart in this poor heart, which was slowly defoliating, for I was like a thistle by the brook. Now I have hopes, I-- Okay, okay, okay. When you're done, - don't forget to turn off the light. - No, Godmother. I'll just practice my O's, since no matter how much I try, it looks like a hen's egg. - [chuckles] See you tomorrow, my son. - Bye, my godmother. OPEN FROM 9 A.M. TO 1 P.M. Open up, please. I can't. It's closed. But it's important. Look at the sign. These are not the enabling hours. We'll miss the train. I don't care. Wait until we open. We have some money to deposit. - Why didn't you say so? - That's it. Open. - Is it a deposit? - Yes. - Don't move. - My God. What's this? A holdup? An assault? What's happening? We came to open an account. Where is the safe? - The safe? - Yes. Answer quick or you die. If I die, I can't answer. Don't tickle. I'm ticklish over there. - Speak up. - The money is not in the safe. The safe is only a decoy. But I know where the money is. Where? If you promise not to hurt me-- Don't prick so hard. I'll show you. But don't hurt me, please. Get a move on. Should I move or not? Start walking. - Hurry up. - Well, don't push me. How? - Well, watch your manners. - Where is it? - I'll ask the manager. - You can't ask him. - Where is it? - In the closet. - Come on, walk. - Walk, walk. - It's locked. - Sure. I have the key. Well, open up. You keep this up, you'll fire a shot, man. - Come on. - Go on, man. - Here's the issue. - Don't quiver. I'm not quivering. I'm just nervous. Just nervous. - Where's the money? - What money? - The bank's money. - Is there any? There is some kind of cupboard. - Rather like a bookshelf. - Yes? - There it is. - Sure? There is the bookshelf, and it's behind it. - The money? - The dough. Don't move. - Are you afraid? - Don't tickle me, man. - Tickle. - [clattering] It's very dark here! Get me a match! I'll go buy some. You stay here! In a minute. In a minute, pal. - Allow me. - Please. Thank you. - Get in there now. - Hey, hey, hey... [doorknob rattling] Hello. Is this the police station? I need to talk to the chief. This is Inocencio Prieto y Calvo. No, sir, it's no joke, it's my name. Yes, sir. From the bank. Yes... [stammers] Not that early. Aren't you available around the clock? You're asleep? So, it's not true that the police never sleep. It's about a robbery. Yes, sir. That's why I'm calling. Two guys held up the bank, actually in connivance, because the robbery didn't take place, due to lack of time and to unskillfulness to my partaking. [man 1] Open up, or you'll see... Yes, let me tell you. Send the investigators, so I can explain. They are in the filing room. They are here. I locked them up. Yes, all by myself. [man 2] Open up, you scoundrel. Send me some men. Some men in those new blue outfits. They are more impressive. You're sending the ones in brown? - Oh, yuck. - [men yelling] Well, it doesn't matter. Send them soon. They are battering the metal. Now stop arguing. We're on our way. Come with me, guys. [sighs] Oh, boy. All right, I'll be right there. They tried to rob the bank. Did they arrest the thieves? Inocencio caught and reported them, all by himself. And is he all right? Apparently he is. I'll dash off. - Take them away. - You will pay for this. - Quiet. - I'll be here. You see how we are always watchful? Yeah, once I caught them. Mind your attitude or I'll take you, too. Efficient, but when I called, you were asleep. So, you caught those bandits, all by yourself? It was a matter of episcolloquy. Whatever the way, that was a real feat. Feat or defeat, if I hadn't been careful, I'd be a dead duck right now. [chuckles] Before you go, I want to have a word with you in my office. At your service, Don Rómulo. So, you turned out to be a hero, my distinguished and worthy illiterate. Since I go to school, you have no right to call me that. Until you get your diploma, go get me some cigars. And I want a cold drink. And a cheese sandwich for me. - With chipotle or jalapeño? - As usual. Then a chorizo one. Let's play a good joke on Inocencio. - Wonderful. - Any ideas? Yes, follow me. I wanted to make sure you're all right. I'm all right. Because you are cold-blooded? In fact, I am quite ardent. Trust me, I'm sincerely glad. Congratulations. "At your service. Inocencio Prieto y Calvo." [all laughing] And here Inocencio will sign. [door opens] Here is what you requested. I'll keep the change. Yes, that's fine. You know, Inocencio, we have all agreed to give you some help. - Good. You'll help with the cleaning? - [all] No. Something better. Today's deed deserves a reward. It was just a coincidence. No big deal. No, look, we have written a letter for you to sign, asking Don Rómulo for a raise as reward, plus one month of paid leave. I think it should come from him, rather than forced under pressure. It doesn't matter. He will be very pleased to know what you want. - He loves to receive things in writing. - Does he? - Of course. - Sure. All right, then. Sure. Tell me. Can you write your name? Not in full. I can do the initiatives. That will do. Let's see. Here you are, take this. Don't stare because you intimidate me. It's oblique because I don't see parallels yet. - Never mind. - On the board, I do it really straight. Well, now, look, take advantage of Don Rómulo being alone right now. - I give it to him? - Yes. - Don't we use an envelope? - There's no need. - No, well, it's like a prelude. - Right. Yes. Go, go. I just hand it to him? Yes, of course. - I think I'd better-- - [all] Go, go. - I find it very-- - [all] Go on. Come in. - I brought you this letter. - Mm-hm. I'll be right back for the answer. No, wait. Who is it from? It's mine, sir. Can you write already? Well, not exactly, but the guys are good people, and they helped me out. Mm-hm. Don't go away. Do you know what this letter says? Well, not in detail. But as for its literature, I know what it's about. Hmm. Would you mind me reading it aloud? No, aloud or a-low, whatever tone is more convenient. Okay, listen. "Dear Don Rómulo. What they've been saying about my heroism for what I did this morning is only lies and mere gossip. The truth is that I made a mistake, since if I hadn't opened the door to those bandits, what happened today would have never occurred. In view of this, I demand that you cut my salary 50 percent as a punishment, that I may never again commit this kind of clumsiness." Is that what you want? Not at all, Don Rómulo. That says opposedly the contrary to what they told me it would say. Unless you have read it wrong. [woman over intercom] Sir? Bring your coworkers. I want to have a word with everyone. Yes, sir. I didn't want to, but they insisted that I should ask for a raise. - I see. - [door opens] - Did you call for us? - [Rómulo] Yes. Come here. Which of you induced Inocencio to write this letter to me? Who? Don Rómulo, it was a joke. You know? As Inocencio can't read or write... Well, I can't read or write, but I have never scoffed at anybody. And if what you know is used to hurt a man's dignity, who, owing to facts in his life, couldn't get cultivated, I'd rather keep being ignorant but with no malice, with honesty. That's how I'd rather be, just as I am. I don't want to become what you are. You know that what you just said was really well-spoken? Well, I can't read and write, but I could talk since I was 3. The hell with them. All right, Inocencio, don't get upset. How can I not be upset? When these guys, instead of being thankful that when I go for their food, I ask here and there, add more sausage, take off the crust, put a good steak in, compensate with a taco, and so on, all that for them, and what for? For this ungrateful ragamuffin to repay me like this. - Ungrateful. - You're more than right. It's the only thing I am more. The rest I am less. Don't worry. I'll make sure you aren't less anymore. So, it was you who played this joke on him. It's about all he can spare. He's so stingy. Then I will lower your salary by half, for six months! - We'd better fire him, so he learns. - He deserves it. And if you're not happy, you can resign right now. Answer me. It's all right, sir. Mm. You can go now. [singing in Spanish] And for you, as a reward, I'll give you a check for 1000 pesos. Thank you, Don Rómulo. Where do I cash it? Right here. The cashier will pay you. Does the bank have enough funds? It has my signature. I'm just asking since checks get bounced, even in the best families. Make the zeroes nice and round, so there are no problems. So... what do you plan to do with this money? Well, now that we are speaking as colleagues, I'd like you to advise me. Would it be best to acquire mortgage cells or petrolling bonds? It's not enough for all that. That's what I thought. You could have given me a check for 2000, but it's already signed. Never mind. I can buy a dress for my godmother. She's worn the same one since my christening. Very well. And then I want to buy a hat, a suit and some shoes for myself. Because I've never worn anything new in my life. - Sounds great. - And to finish... The final brooch. - No, an engagement ring. - Mmm! I'll give it to the young lady who lives in my dreams. A "you and me." A "me and her." That I'll give to her at the fair. Wonderful. And for her, I'll buy a dress, for the local beauty contest. Well, you don't know how pleased I am to have contributed to making all those things possible. And I rejoice in contributing to your being pleased by me. What do you think of that sentence? And I'm only in kindergarten. [band playing festive music] I see you're limping, Inocencio. It's these damn shoes, Godmother. - Are they too tight? - They just fit. My size is eight, and they are six and a half. But these were the last in this style. They are Italian-mold. Yes, they are Italian, and my feet are local. They still don't connect. - [Blanca laughs] - [Epifanita exclaims] I think I'm going to leave you and go to bed, my children. I'm very tired. Too old for so much hassle. - Shall we take you home? - No, what for? You stay here and have fun, while you're still young. Bye, my son. Night. Get into bed, wrap up tight and cover your feet, or you'll start coughing and that will keep you awake all night. Bye, Blanquita, my dear. See you tomorrow. - She's a nice person, isn't she? - Uh-huh. What do you like most at the fair? Everything. So, let's try everything. Oh, Inocencio. No, no, no. Did you get a little dizzy? Hold on tight. Look at this. The stomach seems to go up, doesn't it? Yes. No. Be careful, hold on. That's why I'm holding you tight, okay? [Inocencio exclaims] It feels real smooth. Hold on tight there. Use your leg to help it keep still. Yes, Inocencio. Shall we dance, Aníbal? No, it's too late. I'd better take you home. [music stops] You're out of breath. Want a drink? - Yes, Inocencio. - Let's go. [band resumes playing] Can I take your order? - A tamarind. - And you? A fruit juice with bits of fruit. With pleasure. I wanted to tell you something. Say it, Inocencio. So, what is it you wanted to say? I wanted to tell you, but you won't be upset? I'm sure I won't. Besides, I think I know what it's about. If it weren't asking too much, I'd like you to allow me to... What? To take my shoes off because they are killing me. That was it? I know it's rather uncouth, but this mold has my big toe mounted on the little one and I'm getting some cramps. Almost like chills. Besides, you stepped on my foot a couple of times. Well, don't you worry about me. Thank you, Blanquita. [sighs] Now this is different. - Do you know the time? - It must be... Let me see. It's about... half an hour till midnight. I must leave. The lady only lets me out until midnight. As you wish, Blanquita. Miss. [woman] Yes? Thanks for everything. I've had a great evening. Have you really? I'd never had so much fun. Neither have I. Except for the shoes that are killing me, this has been one of the luckiest and happiest evenings in my whole precarious existence. Good night, Inocencio. Good night, Blanquita. [groans] [romantic music playing] [knocking on door] What is it, Inocencio? I had forgotten. [Aníbal] With so little, you are happy? If you turned to me, you'd be covered in jewels. I don't want jewels. You'd rather be with that pauper? He's no pauper. He's an educated man with a great future. He told me so. Really? Why don't you pop into the bank and find out what he really does? Don't come any closer. All right, as you wish. But I assure you, you will regret this. [peaceful music playing] Still awake, Godmother? I just remembered you have no clean clothes for tomorrow, son. - And how did it all go? - Very well. - By the way, I wanted to ask you a favor. - Let's see. Tell me. For the contest, I wanted to buy Blanquita a typical costume. Like a country girl costume? Something like that but prettier. [chuckles] And you think she'll want to enter the contest? There'll hardly be a contest. She's the prettiest and she's sure to win. Don't worry. Buy me the cloth and the ornaments, and I'll make it for you. I've been thinking. Wouldn't a black velvet dress with cretonne lace be nice? Bobbin lace would be better. Whatever you wish, but make it look pretty. [chuckles] Go on, go to sleep. You have to work tomorrow. Yes, Godmother. Thank you very much. And don't iron so much. You get a backache and then you can't move. [upbeat music playing] Oh, my goodness. I came to see how your feet were doing. Well, my feet... My feet are better. Only I have a blister on my toe. It's still killing me. But all in all, I'm almost better. How are you today? Very good, thank you. As they say, you caught me red-handed, I mean, brush-handed. As the guy who does the cleaning is out, we take turns with the manager. After all, as they say, work is no dishonor. When you get off tonight, could you come and see me? Sure. After the closing of books, as today we must appraise assets. With you, one can say that the hunter became the prey. - He who laughs last laughs longest. - [chuckles] María, make some copies of these, but make sure they're nice and clean. Don Fermín, I'm glad I saw you. I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry about the salary trimming, though you got your dues. But don't worry. I will use my influence, talk to my friend Rómulo and see if he'll give up the punishment. Don Inocencio, would you be so kind as to remove the dust from my humble desk? Shall this not cause the least distress to your dear self? Did you notice the difference? Don't get in the way, Fermín. That's the way to ask. Show that you went to school and caught urbanization. [comical music playing] Would I be asking too much if I beg you to go and get me a cold drink? Yes, you would, but what is requested decently is provided hastily. Thank you, Don Inocencio. [foreboding music playing] I told you that she went out with her mother. Now go away, please. Leave me alone. Did you find out what business Inocencio is in? Yes. Now that I feel I can help him, I love him more. [door buzzing] Don't you hear they are calling? Get off! Let me go! [foreboding music playing] What you really want, we could say, is what in finances we call... You want to open a savings account, don't you, Blanquita? Yes. I have very little, but I think it'll be safer at the bank. It depends on the bank's unsolvency. But the accruals will be yours. And from a financial standpoint, on the one hand it is a lot, and on the other it is not a lot. A lot and not a lot? I don't understand. It's a lot of time to wait and not a lot that you gain. Because you have the trustee and mortgage discounts, but it's very safe. Okay, it's better than nothing. There you go. [Inocencio] Is this all? [Blanca] Yes, when I have more, I'll let you know. What are you doing? Why did you leave the door open? I was just leaving, madam. Don't you work with my husband? Exactly. He's honored to have me among his most efficient coworkers. And I'm almost his advisor. The other-- Your fiancé is waiting for you, miss. Come on, Mom! What kind of guy is that Cannibal? A graduated professional who's new in town, but I don't like him a bit. And is it true he's going to marry Miss Ofelia? It must be only for her money. He may be right about that since for free is very risky. Miss Ofelia is very good. Well, it all depends on... I mean, what you want her for. What? I forgot. On Sunday, it's the town contest to choose the queen. I heard about it. I thought you could be my contender. - Me? - Why not? You can win. You're the prettiest. And the teacher and I will be part of the disqualifying jury, and I'm sure you will win. So, the election won't be fair. It would be biased. That's not new. It's always been that way. I think it's also a regional costume contest. And yours is the prettiest. It's got this shape... You'll see. I already chose it, bought it and paid for it. If you really want it... I don't have much. It's the last 100 pesos of the 1000 that Don Rómulo gave me. Then don't do it, Inocencio. Don't be worried. Besides the pleasure of you winning, it'll be great to brag and say, "I'm with the queen." [romantic music playing] - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you. Why are you surprised? No one should see us together, and least of all, know we're cousins. The one who had the idea of settling you here, until your fraud in Mexico blew over, was me. Remember? Yes, I know. I'm very thankful. How's your business with Ofelia? If I wanted to, I could marry her tomorrow. I told you so. But all I want now is to annoy Blanquita and her wretched Inocencio. - The servant at the bank? - Yes. Look. - [shocking music playing] - [Fermín] What's this? They belong to Mrs. González. - Did you steal them? - Yes. But they'll blame it on the maid and her despicable lover. Mm-hm-hm. Then I can freely offer you a far more profitable business. What is it about? Here. Read this letter. I brought my son. He can't do it at school, but he may learn something here. Why "something"? With my method, he'll learn sooner than with St. Michael's reader. - What's your name? - Lucho. Lucho, that's a substantiative name. Not like your father, who they call the Goat. Can you read? No, teacher. Here you will learn. I don't want you to be like your father, who's 30 and talks with spelling mistakes. Sit down. So, let's see, you bunch of uncultivates. Did you do your homework? Yes, teacher. Let's see if you got the dictation properly. "The garden has threes full of sons." Why, look how brutish you are, really. What did I dictate? Here's your first mistake, "in threes." This is a numeral word and therefore you can't have the H in the first syllable, as it's an uncountable collective noun. - Ah. - "Ah." And then look at your second mistake: "Full of..." You put "sons," with an O, as in "son," from which you think we're talking about offspring. I said: "The garden has trees." See how the gerund appears again, when I actually said "full of sun." As in the verb "to sun." - Where is the verb? - It's in the germ, so we don't see it. Hey, you really made progress. Faster than you can say Jack Robinson. There's more. You'll see what a guy can achieve through his studying efforts because the worst thing is not knowing to read or write. Tonight, I can tell you, I'll give you a huge surprise. I'll read a letter which I haven't read yet, as I didn't have the consonance and couldn't do it fluently or with the proper intonation. But now you'll see what I'm able to do. Where...? The letter's right here. I had it with me. You will see. Someone stole it. - Godmother. - [Epifanita] What's wrong, my son? Where's the letter I got? I don't know. You put it away. I had it here, but as you scrutinize me daily-- Goodness me, don't say that. Where could it be? Don't you worry. Maybe as you said, it was someone borrowing some money. But I want to show these bums what I can do, orally and verbally and fluently. It was here. I brought it here. Okay. I put it in the rear pocket. Two million pesos are quite worth the risk. And what's your idea? You find a way for that Inocencio to sign any blank paper for you. Consider it done. I'll fill it in, saying that he gave me full powers to collect his inheritance. And how will you legalize it? That's up to me. That's why I am a lawyer. Remember that the person must submit his baptismal certificate. While you find a way for Inocencio to sign that blank paper, I'll get a certified copy of the baptismal certificate from the vicar. - And we go half and half, don't we? - Of course. Take this as a sign of trust. ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT There's the lime. Cigars. What a way of wasting paper. Just look. It looks like a streamer. Your cigars. Would you forgive me about the other day? Yes, I'm not spiteful. Are we friends, then? - Friends. - Shall we split up the nougat? Better split up the sandwich. I'm getting hungry. - Half and half. - Let's. So, is it true you can already write your name? - Has the gossip spread? - Yes, but I don't believe it. - You don't? - No. - I'll show you. - Come on. - Give me pen and paper. - Come on, come on. Here's the paper. Name and last name? Sure. But I don't think you can. Even with flourish. - I don't believe it. Let's see? - All right, let's see. Ino... cencio. Because the C is pronounced "zio." P as in "pansy." Prie-- Priet-- Prieto. Prie-- Prieto. Prieto y Calvo. Calvo is not spelled with a K but with a Q. Calvo. Calvo. And now the signature. I'm Inocencio's lawyer, and we need a copy of his baptismal certificate. It happens frequently. Here you are. Thanks. Here you are, for your poor. May God repay you. Here's your dress, Blanquita. My godmother made it on estimations. If it's too long, you can lift the hem. If it's too tight, you can untie the "trutru," and it'll loosen up. But those are unimportant details. Thank you very much, Inocencio. When we danced, I felt you to take your measurements, but you moved a lot, so there may be some mistakes. If there's any, I'll let you know. I'm so excited. And me, I spent many nights sleepless, thinking of being the lucky prince of an alleged queen. It's exciting. You have such a pretty way of saying things. And now that I'm fully into literature, I'll have even more flowery phrases. See you tomorrow. And thank you very much. Good night. And dream of little angels. - I'll dream of you. - Which is about the same. - Good night. - Good night, Blanquita. Oh, Godmother, I'm almost there. [band playing festive music] [applause] "Miss Ber-- Bert--" There's an H here. Is it silent? Silent, yes. "Miss Bertha Capetillo." [applause] And now... follows the next, who is sure to win. Miss Blanca Morales. [crowd] Blanquita! Blanquita! [crowd cheering] I kept them here. In this little box. The only one who comes in here is Blanca. One day while you were out, I was waiting for you in the lounge. Suddenly, I saw her step out of the room. And when she saw me, she was startled and tried to hide something. Was it the same day we saw her give a little package to that boy Inocencio? Inocencio? Yes, I saw it, too. She also told him she'd let him know if she got anything else. - Let's call the police. - No, wait. And right now. But... [sighs] The Guerrero one, she got my attention. Sir, that's because you watched her departure, but she's lacking arrival. I find the Chinanteca pretty. You find her pretty? You can't find a prescription, Mr. Druggist. The Huichola could be one of the 11,000 virgins. But she's not. She lacks demeanor. She lacks harmony. As for me, gentlemen, I must say, I go for Blanquita. You see, the teacher has good inclinations. Then you see where he is inclining. All right, so be it. - I agree. - Me too. I always support the majority. This jury, in full sincerity, has determined that our queen this year will be Miss Blanca Morales. [crowd cheering] [crowd] Blanquita! Blanquita! So, you saw that girl coming out of Mrs. González's bedroom? Yes, inspector. And when she saw you, she was startled and tried to hide something. - Yes. - And after that? The bell rang, and she rushed out. Will you confirm this before the judge? - Of course. - All right. So, why didn't you go to the contest? It got late. Did you know that she won? It was all very nice and amusing, but when she stepped out, well, she was the prettiest. What is all this now? There was no swindle. She's the prettiest. Where did you get that dress? - It's the one I bought for her. - Oh. - You've impressed them. Let's leave. - Just a moment! Miss, do you have something to say about certain jewels which belong to Mrs. González? Jewels? What jewels? The ones you took from your boss's box. And then handed to your accomplice, present here. - Excuse me? - I said, accomplice. Me, accomplice? For your information, and so you don't speak, I have a clean record. I'm an honorable man. And believe it or not-- Do you think...? Do you want references? I can give them to you. Right, Don Rómulo? - Well, yes, actually, I-- - You shut up. So, you're not convicted and self-confessed. We haven't been with Victor or anybody else. Nor did we confess to... Did you take them, Blanquita? How can you think that? I don't, really. I only ask so that this will not start slander. And be careful. I'm an honest man, and she... How can you--? Man. A girl who just won, which of course is obvious, because... Well, as you won't speak, I can only have you arrested and consign you to the judge. - Take them! - Oh, no. I'm not to be consigned. - Don Rómulo, post bail for me. - Madam, please. Now that everything is ready when will we collect the 2 million? Once he is convicted, we'll have enough time. Will you testify in court? Of course I will. I'll be there. To see if this time, they also give that wretched Inocencio a prize. [both laugh] So, you saw one defendant handing a package to the other? As I'm seeing you. I protest and ask to speak. Silence. You will speak when your turn comes. - Well, let my turn come sooner. - [judge] Silence! - [crowd chuckles] - The prosecution still holds the floor. So, that's fine. Let him roll on. I can't stand him. He thinks he's rock 'n' roll and superfluous. The witness has finished, Your Honor. - You may leave, Mrs. González. - Thank you. Your Honor, I'd like to summon the next witness. Next witness. Mr. Aníbal Guzmán. Mr. Aníbal Guzmán. Mr. "Cannibal" Guzmán. - [crowd laughs] - Silence. Silence. It looks like the witness is not here, Your Honor. - Is this witness of importance? - [prosecutor] Undoubtedly, Your Honor. This court is adjourned for an hour to allow time for the witness to arrive. [exclaims] Oh, my poor Inocencio. What are we going to do, teacher? Don't you worry. Everything will be all right. [sighs] So, you say he left the house? Last night, sir. It looks like he went off to Mexico. [Cosme] Easy now, son. Easy now. It's only... It's so upsetting. I stayed awake for nights, draining my brain in a scientific study, to fit into civilization. To do something good in society. What for? So, that they come with calumnies and destroy the honor of an individual. Calm down. They couldn't prove anything. They couldn't, but who'll take away the shame? Now they will take my fingerprints, they will investigate me, and maybe they'll even torment me. Oh, what stress. What stress. But I'm macho. And if I weren't a trusted employee, why would I be at the bank? Managing huge deposits, all in my hands, and I see the money. And I crave it, but I refrain. Why? Because I'm an honest man. Of course, son. And I gave him a copy of Inocencio's baptism certificate. But quite a few days ago. Creep. Who, son? No, nothing, Father. Sorry about the trouble. And excuse me. In light of the witness, Aníbal Guzmán, remaining absent, this court shall proceed without his testimony. The prosecution holds the floor. You said you bought the dress for the codefendant-- - The co-what? - The codefendant, the young lady. -for the coronation party. I said it, and I say it again. Where did you get the money for such a costly dress? With what I had left of the 1000 pesos that Don Rómulo gave me. Mmm! Don Rómulo gave you 1000 pesos? He could have given me more. But I said so, and no one believes me. - Don't yell. - You don't place falsehood. Silence. I beg you to keep more temperance. Yes, temperance. I think you take me as your thermometer. I asked if she gave you a package, let's say, secretively. It wasn't secretive, sir. It was squaredly. Whatever the shape, that package contained the stolen jewelry. You really are a meddler, alterating and entangling. [gavel banging] I urge the defendant to watch his words. And I urge the public prosecution not to place falsehood or say things they're not positive of. - [crowd laughs] - [judge] Silence! What did that square-shape package contain? It had my savings. Which I was to deposit at an interest, so she could collect the dividends, making use of my banking situation. Hmph. Do you have the receipt? I didn't have time. But I have it here. I haven't seen it yet. Allow me. - He may steal it. - Give it to him. - This is not square. - The pocket takes shape of a trifle. [crowd laughs] I don't like him. Kindly open the package, Your Honor. - The stolen jewelry. - [shocking music playing] Silence. Silence. Do you still deny it was you who stole this jewelry? Reply to His Honor. I... I don't know, Your Honor, how that jewelry reached my pocket. I do! Silence. Silence. Come forward. You said you knew who put that jewelry in the defendant's pocket? - Yes, Your Honor. - Well, tell us. I did. Quiet. Quiet. Then it was you who stole them? No, Your Honor. They were stolen by Mr. Aníbal Guzmán, who gave them to me. - [crowd clamoring] - [judge] Silence. No, Dad. It can't be. - Yes, it had to be. He looks thievish. - I can't believe it, Mom. - [judge] Silence. Silence. - [banging gavel] Silence. And can you prove that Aníbal Guzmán is the one who planned the robbery? I can prove that and more. Everything started just the way I will tell you. The notary will not take long. You may wait for him. Of course. [dramatic music playing] That's how my cousin, Aníbal Guzmán, forged a letter with which he could collect the 2 million pesos that Inocencio inherited from his uncle. And right now, Aníbal Guzmán will be collecting the money at the notary's. Wow, me, owner of 2 million. Look at everything that happened from not being able to read in time. Two million. Silence. Silence. I declare the defendants innocent and free as of this moment. [all cheering] It's over. Thank you, God. Don't you worry. It's over. Don't be silly. Don't cry. Justice comes. Late but it comes. The fact is that it's blind, so it loses its way. But it got here. The preparation of all the documents will take some time, as you know. How long, sir? It's 1 p.m. Would 5 p.m. be all right? All right. I'll have everything ready for you, including your check. Excuse me. Hello. Hello! Hello. No. No, miss. No, no, no. What? The lines are dead? Yes, yes, miss. Yes, yes. Thank you. You heard it. There's no way to get in touch with the notary. - What shall we do? - Go to Mexico while I try to get through. How do we go? My car's outside. I put it at your service, Don Inocencio. Thank you, pal. Let's go. Come on. Hello. Hello. Yes, yes, miss. Look, please, try to put me through. [suspenseful music playing] The notary told me to come at 5. He called. He won't be here till 6. All right. I'll be back in an hour. Mm-hm. - Put it out, man. - But there's no water. - Put it out. - With what? Hello. Yes, miss, please. Try to put me through. It is urgent. I'm sorry, but please understand, I'm a little bit anxious. All right. Do what you can. Do what you can. Please, put me through. I'll wait here. Get ready, will you? I'll wait here. - Has he arrived? - Yes, he's waiting. Come in. Thank you. May I? Come in, Mr. Guzmán. Do you know Mr. Inocencio Prieto y Calvo? - No. - What do you mean, you don't? Well, yes, I meant-- Whatever you meant, you won't any longer, will you? Get him. Come here, my dear. Do me this favor. Sign here, will you? Here. What for? Sir, it's the proof that you have received the 2 million. Yes, excuse me, but I'm just exhausted with so much cheating and stuff. - And the cents? - Here's your check. - The pen. - And here's your pen. Here's your checkbook, Mr. Inocencio. Thank you, Don Rómulo. Tell me, what do you plan to do with that money? First I'll buy my godmother a washing machine, so her back won't ache anymore. - You'll keep washing but sitting down. - Thank you, son. Then I'll allocate a big sum to build many schools for children, for rebels, for adulterers-- You mean, "adults." Those too. So, that we stop having so many illiterates, and they don't suffer what I went through. I'm proud of you, Inocencio. And I'm proud of you, teacher. And the rest of your fortune? [romantic music playing] I'll do my best to please the woman who encouraged me with her trust. Is that your intention, Inocencio? It's a direct wedding proposal in its full order. Bravo, Inocencio. Bravo. Girl, you got yourself a pearl. Oh, Godmother, you're always so alterative. - Blanquita. - Thank you very much, Don Rómulo. [triumphant music playing]
