-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- So, we're halfway there right now. Feeling great! Waiting to go back up. - I got you! Vik, what do you think of our crew? Amazing! Super! I love it! Except Den is an idiot. - Man, she's got a fat ass. - That's it! Oh, so, you're alive? Hey, ladies! Hi there! Roman Michalych is all yours. Single, good-looking, has a big business. Let's not forget that, huh? - Oh, yeah, Roma recently opened a car-wash service. - Hey, can I get a hand over here? - This is our guest of honor! - The Christmas tree! Our stuff is about to leave! And here is our main man. He's our hero. You see how serious he is? He's still organizing things. Well, let's not disturb him. Love you, and I'll see you guys in about an hour on that mountain over there, for New Year's Eve. Bye, now! How much longer to the lift? We're pretty close. Creepy. Yeah, looks like local art, huh? Assholes. Well, you sure know how to get the party started, Kirill. I'll hire you as my party planner to keep my guests entertained. Why the hell are we going up there, anyway? This way is faster. I told you we're late. Roma, please hurry up, OK? You're holding everyone up. What do you mean, "holding everybody up"? Who got a Christmas tree? Roma did, didn't he? Who got booze after hours? I did! -What would we do without you? Hey, look, I even got you a cat for your birthday. - Oh, here we go. Roma's favorite story. Forget it. Babe, what are they talking about? It was me who hooked them up at Kirya's birthday party. Yeah, Roma's been trying to get with her for three months, but... it didn't work out. Hey, guys, look at that. It's beautiful. All right, guys. Family photo. - Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Let's do it! - Let's do it! - No, guys. - Come on! - We don't have much time. - Hold on. We'll be quick. - Hold on. Hold on, just a sec. - Oh, it's freezing! Here. I don't need that. I just did my hair. Picture, picture, picture. Put this on. Hold this. Super. Babe, put this on. - Here? - Yes, perfect. Super! Ready? - Come on, say cheese! - -Cheese! It's on video! All right, guys, we really don't have much time. But, Kir, wait. Let's do a selfie. You can see everything just fine. - Yeah, for sure. Let's freeze our asses off for a selfie. Now let's say "freeze-cheese!" "Freeze-cheese!" Excuse me. Whoo! Happy New Year! -Hey! Happy New Year, Masha! - Yeah, you, too! It's really loud over there. -There's clapping. All right, let's do it! I'm scrolling through your feed now and it sure doesn't look like you're on your way. Yeah. I'm sorry, I forgot to text you. We ended up going to the mountain with Kirill. What do you mean? Didn't you dump him? Mash, he was being so good, and I just... didn't want to upset him on New Year's Eve. All right. Kat, did you go to the doctor? Are you serious? You're gonna keep the baby? No, of course not. They made an appointment for after the holidays. All right, don't sweat it. Kirill understands that now... now isn't the time. I don't want Kirill to know. It will be easier for me that way. OK. Hugs and kisses! We'll see you when we get off this mountain. Goodbye! Hurry! Let's go! Masha called me. Yeah, I figured that out. - Boo! - What are you, stupid? This is straight out of a horror film. What's this, an achievement board? What's wrong with you? It's a shrine. Holy crap. So many people died here. Like the saying goes, "The mountains take theirs." "Take theirs," huh? You think they'll let us on? It's pretty late. Kat, I set this up a month ago, at least. Kirill, we got a situation. How the hell did you set this up? - What happened? - Oh, nothing. The station closed half an hour ago. That's it. Happy New Year! We had a deal! You promised me! Hey, listen, man, have you looked at the time? New Year's in less than an hour. You're late. I'm going. Goodbye. Wait. Listen! You either take us up, or else... Or else what? - What? - What?! You better chill out. - Why are you so cocky? - -What? Roma, here, take a clementine. Can I talk to you for a second? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Why you starting shit? It's all good. You set this up a month ago? Hmm. Let me ask you something. - Have you ever been to Yaroslavl? Say what? Well, I just found a postcard with a view of Yaroslavl, and I thought you just might like it. Come on, man, do us all a big favor. What am I, a cop? - There are rules, you got that? - Yeah, I get it, rules. But we have a situation here. It's really screwed up. Hey, see these guys over there? Well, apparently they're in love. Roma, get lost. What do you want from me? That guy over there, he's got connections in Kavkaz. Someone's coming right now to wash away our sins, and they're gonna kill us right here if we don't go up. Anyone got a postcard from Khabarovsk? What? Five thousand. All right, listen here. The lift is automatic, so don't touch anything inside the cable car. Got it. Don't puke on the floor. And don't jump out of the cable car. OK. And keep the doors locked. Yep. And don't even think about fucking inside. We'll do our best! Let's go. Move it. Has anyone seen my bag? It's kind of brownish. - Nope. - Nope. I may have left it at the bottom. It's around here somewhere, I saw it. Is something important inside it? A wallet? Some money? -No. Forget it. We'll get it on the way back. Are you going or not? Kirill, I'll buy you a new one. Let's go, man. All right, everyone out! I'm gonna shut this thing down. Hey, hey, hold up, old man. We're going, we're going! We're not going anywhere without my bag. What the hell, man? You lost your bag, now our celebration gets fucked up? - Katya, get out. - What do you mean? Get out. We're not going anywhere. Are you kidding? I promised to make a video from the top. Screw the video! Can you just do what I'm asking you to? I'm staying here. You can do whatever you want. Katya. Katya! Guys. Kirill, enough. Let's go. You guys ready or not? - Katya! - Yo, start her up, old man! Kirill! You guys are nuts. Yeah, guys, enough! Me and Den argue like this five times a day. I don't know. Everything happens for a reason. Hey, Katya, don't worry about it. Some guys just need more easygoing girls. Roma, don't get involved, OK? What? What? You think that real men don't act like that? Katya, I'm sorry... but if I was Kirill, well, I sure wouldn't let you go, girl. On New Year's Eve, alone, with a cute car-wash owner? Yeah, anyway, everything that happens... happens for the best. Love yourselves, stay active like me, and show some love! Are you serious? Have you ever watched my channel? Where do you think all your likes come from, huh? Ah, beautiful people, smile! Come on, it's New Year's Eve! Ah, give me that. Why, you don't use your hands? - Roma, try to be careful, OK? - Katya, it's all good. You're with me. And that means you're as safe as you can be. Oh, I don't doubt it. That's enough. Katjusha... let's be together. What's wrong? How you spend your New Year's Eve is how you're gonna spend the New Year. Let's do it... OK? Maybe you should slow down a little bit. Damn it. We're here. Is this a joke? Well, it looks like the power's out. But this kind of shit happens here. I wonder for how long? - I don't know. Maybe until the morning. - Den? Now what? No worries. They'll turn on the backup generator soon. Yeah, if they actually have one. Guys, we've been up here for about 15 minutes now. Hey, Roma, you going out for a walk, or what? Uh huh. Are you crazy? Can a guy take a piss in peace? Seriously, you can't hold it? Katjush, holding it is very, very bad for a young man, all right? Roma, lock the door and hand over the key. Get them yourself. My hands are busy. I can give you the one for my room. There's a bathroom and a Jacuzzi. All right, much lighter. Light as a feather and ready to go. Thanks, bro! I wanted to take a piss and ended up almost shitting myself! It's my job, baby. Motherfucker. How about a shot, anyone? - Want some Pringles? - No. No. Hey, guys, is this Kirill's? Huh? I see you like to touch things that aren't yours. I'm looking for my hat. What's this? Goddamn. - Guys. Now I get why he freaked out so much. Hey, Santa Claus, we found your goody bag here. Great. Congratulations. Well, maybe you'll join us? I suggest you get your sleigh ready. You could have gotten a bigger one. Hmm. Tell Katya to throw it out. Why are we throwing it away? We might need it for ourselves. Well, now. Holy shit. Hey, Kirill really took this shit seriously. Did he for real want to fly these things up there? Why not? It's really cute. Give it to me. - Chill, Kat. I'm just playing. - Except it's not funny. Is it nice? Well, he shouldn't have stayed behind. OK, maybe he really can't hear. Think he got mad? Thank you. Happy New Year to you, too, all right? All right, I love you. Well, that's just great. I'm not getting any bars. Same here. Yeah, my mom, my mom. She really wants to meet my girlfriend. Hmm? So, tell me something. Do you have any cute friends, perhaps? Mmm-Mmm I got a friend, though, and you're just exactly his type. Oh, don't start this shit again. That's enough. It's Kirill for sure, playing with the controls. Hey, guys, it's New Year's in a few minutes. Why are you all such party poopers? Let's have fun, Katya! - Don't be a party pooper! - Who's a pooper? - Let's go! You're a pooper. Shit. -Oh, yeah? Yeah, only once in your life you can spend New Year's Eve like this. Let's do it! Here, come on, put some music on. Come on, let's go! -Hold on. Wait a minute. The president's speech is beginning soon. Let's go! I'm on it. - Oh, yeah! - Hey! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! The customer you are calling is unavailable. Three! Two! One! Happy New Year! Happy New Year, everyone! Happy New Year! - Come on, come on, come on. - Chop-chop. Let's go! Three, two, one! Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Come on, drink up! - Hurray! Hurray! - Where's the Champagne? And just as I promised, a video from our party. This is the best New Year of my life! You guys, let's take pictures! Come on, come on. - One, two... - Look alive! Look alive! We're stuck in a cable car, and if you think about how high we are, it's actually pretty cool. What? It's fun! Yeah, we got a ton of food and plenty of booze! We can survive the end of the world up here baby, not just New Year's Eve! Our wonderful buffet. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Hey, guys, wake up! Den! Guys, they're coming to get us. What happened? Bad dream? Why are you yelling, huh? I thought I saw something. Let's not yell anymore, OK? Denis, what time is it? Den? Den? Den? Den? Hello there. You guys up? Babe, are you crazy? Don't scare us like that again. What do you mean? What was I supposed to do, leave a note? Doesn't look like anyone's looking for us, right? - Maybe it's too early. - Too early for what? To save people, Katya? We could be sitting in a nice hot tub right now, but, no, we just had to go up... Stop whining. Start thinking about what we're going to do. No, wait. Tell me, why is it that every single January 1st, it's always our shift? It's called discrimination. Who else do they have? All those men are nothing but drunks. So what? Maybe I want to get drunk, too? Maybe I got a life as well? Typical! Well, there's no reception. And it doesn't look like anyone realized we're stuck up here. Yeah, yeah, you're a genius. How is it possible nobody's looking for us? What do you see? Anything? We're in a cloud, guys. One. We can try to go down the cable. Are you insane? Vik, tell him that's a bad idea. -Babe! All right, I heard you! Yeah, I think it's about 100 meters, if not more. Guys, I think the old man at the station got drunk and passed out. Let's just wait it out until somebody gets here. Katya, the trail only opens at 8:00 a.m. That means somebody should notice at the beginning of the shift. 9:00 a.m. They actually rescued us an hour ago. Well, maybe something's broken and they're fixing it. Help us! Help! Vik. Help! Somebody, help us! Help us, please! Vika! Scream a little louder, maybe someone will hear you. Dammit. Look at this mess he left us here. It's crazy! He never even signed out. Oh, here we go. What is it? All right, we've got to ration the food here, OK? And please don't touch the flares, all right? Listen, we'll melt the ice and ration the water. This is all we got left. Hey, who put you in charge? You got any better ideas? At least we have more than enough food. Yeah, sure. It's so cold it's like a fridge in here. Relax, relax. There's got to be something here in case of emergencies. Like what? A panic button? Oh, look at this. This has got to be an emergency exit. That means there's also a harness somewhere. Yeah, maybe a parachute. Well, let's look. Even if you do find one, what are you gonna do with it? It makes no sense. Yeah, it makes no sense why we're up here anyway. Well, nobody forced you, Roma. What's going on? Isn't it working? The cable car is stuck in the middle of the trail. - What's the reason? Who knows. I'm gonna call the repair team, let them figure it out. Where am I gonna find someone on New Year's Day? Maybe you should go and have a look. Svetochka, I'm very sorry, but there's no way I'm going down there. All right, we'll figure it out. Hang on. I can hardly wait. All right. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is what I'm talking about! Here's a harness. I told you guys. This is what they use to get people down. All right, now all we need is a rope. What for? To hang ourselves? Seriously, guys, this is stupid. Even if everybody at that station is already gone, Kirill is definitely looking for us. He's very busy looking for a new girl and thinking about how he's gonna get her laid. Hey, that's enough! Just look for a rope. Yes. Yes. Hi, hi. Oh, Kirjusha! Come here and wish me a Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. Kirjushen'ka, we want to wish you and Katya a wonderful and Happy New Year! Kirjush, Kirjush, tell us where you and Katjusha are, all right? - When are you getting married already? -When's the wedding? We'd like... I don't know Looks like never. Why? What's going on? - Listen, Mom. - Kirjush, what happened? I'll call you back. I love you. There's nothing but garbage. This is just amazing. We've got a freaking harness here but no rope to get down with. What are you looking at over there? Just looking for your panic button. Motherfuckers! When I get down there... I'm gonna bury them all myself. Two hours. The second shift is probably having their lunch right now. Shit! There should be a line up the lift right now. It's high season, for crying out loud! It took us an hour to get here. Oh, hi. How long is the wait for the lift? It's closed for renovations. - And what can we do now? - Down there. - Go down the hill. There's a new line now. OK. No, but really... just toss this thing over... and use the cable here to go down to the station. - Brilliant idea! - -Why not? The cable goes this way. You'll just get stuck in there and hang like an idiot. - You guys, chill, OK? - For sure. We're all just gonna chill now. A magician will come down in a blue helicopter and will rescue us any minute. Yeah, well, if we can't go down, then... maybe we can go up? Yeah, you know, like Thai people who climb up the trees for coconuts. - That will do it. - Give it here. What? No good? Vik. - Wait a minute. - Vik, don't do it. You looked here already, no? - What? When did you find it? - What does that even matter? - What do you mean, "Why does it matter?" Are you fucking crazy? You guys, I swear I thought they were going get us out. Maybe use your brain! Who's gonna save you up here? Your pretty boyfriend Kirill? - Hey, calm down. - Why calm down? Who the fuck are you? Who put you in charge here? No, who the fuck are you? You know this is more serious than bungee jumping. Well, you better watch your mouth. Unbelievable! How long can we sit up here? - So you'd rather be dead? - Everyone, shut up! The last thing we need is a fight. This is our last chance, guys. There are four of us. Should be easy to get one down. Yeah. Looks like the rope should be long enough. So, what, you're acting so brave, are you? Well, she is the lightest. What about your dear Katjusha? Should she go? Shut up! Seems fair to me. Roma, watch your mouth. You hear me? It's fine, I'll go. We're all out of clementines, anyway. All right, cool. Wait a second. Why don't you go? What do you mean? What I mean is there are other men here. - Babe, enough. - What enough? How convenient. He's also lighter, right? You got a problem with me? - Yeah, I do! - Vik! You were quick to open the door when you needed to piss, but when it's time to go down, you're a pussy? Listen, sister, you better keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you! You motherfucker! - Denis, stop it! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Enough! Enough, you guys! Stop it! Stop it! I'm gonna throw this thing the fuck out! Hey, everyone. It's day two inside the cable car. And it's not that much fun anymore, because it's fucking freezing in this place. But I think we've figured something out. Yeah. Den, what are we making? A safety harness or...? Well, yeah, sort of a safety harness. So it looks like we're gonna hook me up to this rope here, and the guys are going to let me down, and the middle of the rope will be tied to the rail. In case you guys let go, I won't fall all the way down, and, you know, hopefully survive. Well, I know it looks like fun and games, but it's not, so, kids, please don't try this at home, whatever you do. Don't try it. Yeah, New Year is very dangerous. Yo, brother, you got to record this kind of shit. Babe, please be careful. Listen, if I'm not back in an hour, just... just call the cops. Dumbass. All right, you guys, I'm out of here. And don't open the door to strangers. OK, Dad. Can you grab the garbage on your way out? Wait, wait, wait! Ah. Pull me back! There's not enough rope! Why is he so heavy? Looks like he really wants back up. Hey! Hey! I said pull me back up! Den. - To the airport. - Alone? Are you sure? Alone. Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! You killed him! Why did you kill him? Vik, we could have fallen. Why did you do that? You killed him! Why? We would have fallen down. Do you understand? Everyone. Me, Katya. Understand? You're lying! You're lying! Go ahead, tell us! Tell us! Say it! How did you kill him? Vik, what's the matter with you? How did you kill him? Tell us! No, Vik, don't. There's snow. There's lots down there, and it's soft as well. He's alive. He's alive, I'm sure. They have to save him. Of course they'll save him, for sure. What did you say? "Save him"? So you'll do it. Right now, go down there and save him. Vika... Right now. Vik, we would have both fallen. Why the hell are you defending him? Go and get your ass to the door! Vik... OK. What do we do? What do we do? OK. I'm cold. I'm... Oh, what do we do? What do we do? Your hands! Your hands are cold! Come on, help me! I don't know how to. We need to stop the bleeding with something. I'm so cold. - Higher or lower? - Hold up. A vein or an artery? What color is this? - Shut the hell up! We need to make a hole. I'm so cold. Motherfucker. This is pointless! We're not doctors. Vik, don't fall asleep! Vik, don't fall asleep. You hear me, Vik? Look at me! Come on! Hey! Over here! Den, let's stay home. We're here! Hey! - Shit. - Den. Roma! Get the flare! Hurry up! Get on the roof! Vik! Vik, they're coming for us! You hear them? Katya, hurry up with the flare! Let's go, let's go. Vik, you hear me? Over here! Hey! OK. Hey! Over here! Hey! Come on. Hey! We're over here! Help! Hey! Help, please! Help! Hey! Please help us! Please! That's it. - They'll... They'll come back. - Katya... Katya, are you stupid? That's it, we all just fucking died! Shall I tell you whose fault is it? Why don't you calm down! They'll be back, I'm sure. Calm down! They will come back! Everyone owes you everything! Now, move! Are you crazy? Get away from me! Who cares about you? Move away from the door. Why do you look so upset? Get in a fight with your girlfriend? Don't worry, you're still young. You'll find someone better. You can never understand these women. Today she likes you, tomorrow she doesn't. Vik. You bitch! Bitch! She's dead already. All you had to do was light the goddamn flare. Let's try again. Let's try together. We... We need to... We need to open the door from the outside. We're too high up. I can't reach it. All you need to do is to get a little lower. Rom, this is stupid! Rom! Yeah, I'm gonna hold you tight, don't worry. It's OK. Trust me. I got you. Trust me. The door is almost open. Come on. Together, one more time. Come on. Rom! Go. Rom, let's go! Go. Go! Rom. Rom. Please, Rom. That's it. It's all your fault, Katya. Get away! Get away! Come on, move it! Come on, move, Rom! Oh, are we upset? Katjusha, where are you going? You're gonna fall. Katjush, hold on or you're gonna fall! Katjush, hold on or you'll fall! Katjush, we're on the same team, babe. Come here, babe. Come on. Come on! Fucker. Bitch! I'll get you. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going, huh? Where are you going? Come here! Come on! Come on! Come on, Katjusha! Come on, a little more. Come on. We're on the same team. Come here. Vik. Vik, come on. Motherfucker! OK, let's have a look. Oh, yeah, very sexy legs. - Katya, I hope this isn't live. - It is. Because I'm not ready. Not too shabby. Come here and give me a kiss. We're at the airport. No, nobody came to room 237. Thank you. - What do you mean? - It's exactly what I said. - All the keys are right here. - Yes, well, wait a minute. My friends from room 237, what about them? Hello? Hello? Yes, my friends from room 237, are they there? The same thing, sir. There's no one there. Uh huh. Hold on. Let me check one more time. No. No, sorry. Nobody. OK. Thank you. Wait! Wait! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Let's go back. No! No! Ow. Wake up. Vik. Please, Vik. Don't do this to me. Just like that. Much better. Please. Please. I'm begging you. Please. No. No. No. No. No, no, no! Are you fucking... Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? Hey, Kir. I hope you get to watch this video. I want there to be only... one view. From you. I think that... this is the perfect time to say goodbye. Don't think I'm giving up or anything. It's just my phone is gonna die soon. I'm sorry, Kir. I... I know that I was wrong sometimes. I was just afraid to be like everyone else. I remember, I read somewhere that a person isn't born special. You become special thanks to your people. You were enough for me. I want you to know that. I want to show you something. Yes, I do. I mean, if you still want to marry me. Because now... we're a real family, you understand? A mom, a dad... and a baby. I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, but it doesn't matter... because I... I already love it so much. Please, forgive me. Forgive me for not telling you earlier. If you can, because... I can't forgive myself. Kirill... I love you so much. Bye, love. I think today's weather will be a real trial, guys, for the whole region. Stay safe. It's been Aleksandr Pon and Igor Pankov. - We'll try to create a mood... - OK. Thank you. Thank you. I really need to get up there, please. Now? There's no way, man. Look at the snowstorm coming. Please, let me go up, right now! Not now, friend! Go up next time. How can I get up there? All the way straight, all the way up. Hey! Iceman, stop! Daddy! Daddy, look! Balloons! Here you are! - Look, look, look, quick! - Look, Daddy! - Flying! They're flying! - Can you see? Wow! I will not... die here! What the hell? I can't reach anyone. Hello? Sveta, can you hear me? Sveta! We have a situation here, an accident. Can you hear me? I don't know. I found him hanging in the engine room. Call the rescue team now! Hurry up already! The cable car dropped from the cable! Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Sveta? Were there people in it? I can't see it, it's behind the mountain. Were there people in the cable car? What people? I personally brought everyone down yesterday when I started my shift. There are no people there. Nothing's working since December 31st. Where are you going? Katya! Look, the wheel is blocked! The rescue team is on their way! Shit! It's not working! Do it! Pull it! Come on! I said do it now! Pull harder! Come on! Harder! Start her up!
