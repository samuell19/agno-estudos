What's the idea, taking so long? Where's the toupee? Where did you file it? Well I... Oh, I remember now. I filed Smith's toupee under D. What's the idea of filing it under D? It had dandruff. Why, you imbecile. Leave the imbecile alone. Oh, yeah? Get out of here. Leave him alone. I told you, leave him alone. [CRUNCH] [SCREAMS] Why you-- I'll kill you! Wait a minute, we got work to do. Kill him later. Remind me to kill you later. I won't have time later. Then I'll kill you now. [GROANING] Why you... MOE: I'll mash you. Why, I'll-- Oh, look. Look! I told you that thing had dandruff. Leaping dandruff! Hey, it's alive. Get something and kill it, kill it! Wait a minute. I'll kill it. Don't shoot. We gotta test that gun to see if it's the murder weapon. You're right. This gun may solve the crime. Yeah, but wait a minute. If it doesn't-- We haven't got time to wait. We're late now. Hey, Shemp's got a point there. If we-- If, if, if! We gotta find out and right away. Well, uh-- Nyah... Be careful with that thing. [GRUNTS] Who threw that? What's the matter with you? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. Oh, a new newsboy girl, eh?

My niece inveigled me to come to her country estate and I fell for it. I'm convinced she and her husband are mixed up in rackets. and I'm fearful for my life. You don't say. He did say. Quiet. Where are you, Mr. Goodrich? I'm at 1313 Hysteria Terrace. You drive up Murder Gulch Highway, along Bloody Creek till you come to Deadman's Curve. And then you turn right on Poison Bend Road till you come to the cemetery. Pass the cemetery to Skeleton Flats and up Hysteria Terrace. Uh-- Good grief. What a place to be stuck in. Don't let them kill you till we get there. We'll be right over. Get the camera. Wait a minute. We have to establish the time. Look at your watch. Okay, but you'll have to wait till I go to the pawn shop. Hey, what does your watch say? It doesn't say anything. You gotta look at it. Mm-hm? See that? Aw, that don't-- [ALL GRUNT] Here we are. [ALL GRUNTING AND SHOUTING] There. I feel a lot safer already. [GRUNTING] Very neatly done, Nikko. Take him away. But sir, Mr. Goodrich phoned. The detectives are on their way. Detectives? That's not good. Don't worry, my sweet. They won't stay long. [CHUCKLES] Sleeping pills. The permanent kind. [MEN CHUCKLE] [DOORBELL RINGS] Stand where you are. We're detectives. What's going on around here? Search the suspect! Suspect? The butler's always a suspect. Hold for a still. Good. Okay. I think he moved. Wait a minute. What'd you find? Only this. Why you... Ooh!

Oh! Come on. He's right. What could happen? I guess I'm just the nervous type, I guess. [CHUCKLES] Hello. [GASPS] Oh... ALL: Hello. We're detectives. Mr. Goodrich sent for us. Oh? I'm his niece. The niece is nice. Heh-heh! Hold on. We're here on business. I mean business. Oh. Wait a minute. Why you-- Hold it. You know what this means? You can't give-- Ooh! Oh, the glass. Mm, I'm framed. I'm afraid something dreadful has happened. Uncle has disappeared. No. He was sitting right over there. Suddenly, I heard a scream. [ALL YELP] Let go on me, will you? Then he was gone. Well, don't worry. We'll take take of everything. We'll find fingerprints. Get the camera ready. Come on, eagle. Get busy. [GRUNTS] Oof! What's the matter? Nothing. Uh-- Get that letter. Which one? That one! [SCREAMING] Come on over and look for fingerprints. Look at that. It's got that pollen about written on it. But I'll fix that. Stopped down a quarter of a mile, that's about right. Somebody left some hypo in there. Oh, highly polished mahogany. And termites. With big blue eyes. Uh... Get out of here! Fingerprints! Right, ready with the camera. Coming right up. LARRY: Aha! Fingerprints. [SHEMP SNIFFING] SHEMP: Mm, wow. What a doll. No, Moe! Larry, help! There was an ugly looking thing staring right at me. It was horrible. Why do you know? It was you. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] You imbecile. We're getting no place fast. May I make a suggestion? Yeah. Sure, certainly. Why not separate and search the place? What an idea. Brilliant. One of you come with me. Yes, I-- Come here. Wait a minute. I heard what the lady said. Come on! Leave us leave, my sweet. Oh! Don't you rise your hand to me. Now, don't you go get yourselves murdered. Don't worry about us. Murder? Nyah! Turn me loose. Like I told Shemp, there's nothing to be afraid of. Not a thing. Of course not. And spread out. Let's have a little drink. Oh, boy, that's for me. Now, don't go away. Oh, I won't. [SQUEAKS] Hm, nice picture. Yes, isn't it? So natural it looks like the trees move. [LAUGHS] Yes, sir. I sure enjoy good pictures. Well, then. I'm sure you'll like that one. Oh, yes, nice. Very nice. But you know, uh, I like that much better. Oh, you do, do you? Heh-heh. It's by a very famous painter. The same one who painted that one. Oh, charming. Charming. But my favorite is, uh, that one. It is lovely. Yes, it is lovely. [CHUCKLES] Well, cheerio. A couple of pip-pips, little barbecue and what have you. [BOTH CHUCKLE] A short life and a merry one.

Numbskull. Oof! [LARRY & MOE SHOUTING] MOE: You're nothing but a nitwit. LARRY: Thank you, thank you. Aah! Aah, let go! [LARRY & MOE GROANING] I guess that takes care of handsome Harold. Oh, you're a genius. Nice work, kid. Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing at all. [LAUGHS] I'll never forget the first time I saved a couple of guys. It was in a pool room. A guy walks in, he says, "Stick 'em up." I says, "Nothing scares me." Will you cut it out? Cut it out. He says, "Yeah?" And I says, "Yeah," right back at him. Give him a-- What's the matter with you?

[CRASHING AND GROANING] [STOOGES GRUNTING] It's all over, boys. You can get up now. You beat them up. [CHUCKLES] It's wonderful, wonderful. Tell me, uh, how did you do it? I did it with my little shovel. One of them was coming at me. I let them have it. Another one came at me from this side. Wham, wham! I let them have it. I start to swing left and right. Five of them started to come at me. Did that stop me? No! Wham, I-- Hey. Hey, where did everybody go? Oh, Moe! Larry! Look, wait for me! [♪♪♪]
