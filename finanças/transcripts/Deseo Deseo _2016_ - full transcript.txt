I just want to go home now. I know, but we need to finish this. Give me your hand, Lucas, give me your hand. - No, mom. - Give me your hand, please. - We have to finish it. - I want to go home now, it hurts a lot. But we can't. No, honey, honey… Please, stay still, it's the last one… No, honey, we have to finish this. Sweetie, if we don't do it, we'll never get out of here. No, mom, no! Lucas! Watch out for tarantulas in this shithole. Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! There is a stale smell. She was quite bitter. She didn't get laid in 50 years. Don't mouth off, it was your granny. Man, we came to visit her at least 3 times. But the bloody old lady just hated us. What's up, fats? How are you doing? She hates us all, our parents and everybody… She didn't even come to see my mom at the hospital. She didn't even go to funeral. Cut it, fool, it's by Hugo Boss. No shit. I didn't know you could buy Hugo Boss at Coppel, man. Asshole. Hey, why are you wearing a shirt? I don't know, I felt like it, what's your problem? “I felt like it”. Keep lying, man. If you wanted to look pretty you needed to buy a shirt that fits you. It looks like a tent on you. What are you laughing at, fats? You dress like that character in The Simpsons. Which one? The fat one who owns a comic books store. Sorry, you fucks. I don't need to buy my self-esteem with designer clothes. The thing is that you buy them in the market. T-Shirts with Zodiac Knights monkeys. What knigths...? Look, just so that you don't look so ignorant, this is Cowboy Beebop, from… I don't give a shit, those are Chinese monkeys. Your dick is hairy already, man. Stop watching Chinese cartoons. Easy, tiger. Your piece of ass is coming. What the fuck is it with you? No shit, man. You still have a crush on Ari? It's not a crush. He is nuts about her. Really asshole? Well, what about it? 1, she's with someone. 2, she is related to you. She is your second cousin, you pig. Pharaohs married their sisters, man. Easy, Tutankamon. And I pass as the family's pervert. Cleopatrass is here. I should invent a cell phone that would recharge with the sunlight. They don't last for shit. Cousins, welcome to granny's ruins. You're so funny, cousin. Please, tell me you have a charger for this shit. No shit, this looks exactly the same. Jacobo and Jorge are in the living room. Cousin. - What's up, cousin? - How are you doing? - Fine. You? - Fine. Good. How is your mom? She is fighting. The chemotherapy makes her restless and she throws up a lot. But her last analysis show the tumor indicators are receeding. Her cancer seems to be decreasing. That's good. Everything will be all right, you'll see. Yes, God willing. How is Regina? How is the wedding coming along? Don't ask. The church, the restaurant, Regina's dress, invitations, the reception, the DJ, the honeymoon... I'll have to sell a kidney. - What's up. - Hello, Ari. Georgie boy, you look so handsome. I just made a mess. Thanks, you too. How have you been? Hold on. Tell me you have a charger for this. Not really. How have you been? How goes acting? Man, Santi Torre Mayor told me he would introduce me to the CEA director, from televisa. Man, it's super urgent that I start a career right now, and I need a soap. Mexican TV is super superficial and with no depth, but that is how Salma got started, right? I need to be known here so that I can go abroad. I'm thinking of going to Los Angeles, I don't know. LA is super nice, but there are plenty of gangbangers and they revolt me. Jaco! Weny! You're so skinny! Thanks, cous. How is your dad going? Just as annoying, the bastard. Jaco, that's your dad. Fat, check. Nerd, check. A virgin, check. Still living with his dad, check. Fats, you're one step away from being a serial killer. That's enough. Leave him alone. This is all of us. Let's check the place out to see the crap damn old lady left behind. Hey, a little respect. Sorry. Let's see what treasures left the damn old lady. Choose whatever you like, because one month from now this house and everything in it is going down. Corpses included. Take one with you, so you have company when you go to the movies. That's right. Ther's not even a film theater in your town, right? There's no theater but we do have a circus and they're hiring dwarves. Interested? Listen, we meet every hundred years to waste our time fighting. Plus, Jorge is much too tall for a dwarf. But, if they're also hiring clowns... Come on, damn Wenny. Each one has to carry their own burden. Stop kidding around, Let's start shopping already. - Come on. - Shopping. So sad to live here. So sad living here with grandma. Dad says she was nuts. The one time my dad told us about her he was really drunk… and he just said that she would beat them up regularly and would lock them up in the closets. You know what happened to grandma's first husband? Jaco's grandfather? - Yep. - No. - He was killed. - No shit. Yes. Him and his brother, in front of grandma and uncle Lucatero. For real? Yes. Ari. I think that drove her nuts. Then she met horny grandpa, he knocked her up, and here we are. Ari? Dad says that when grandpa left her she would lock herslef up in her room for days. Uncle Rodrigo was a toddler, and uncle Lucatero was alreday gone. So she only had my dad and yours, to beat them up and leave them in the closet. Ari? Fag. - You got scared? - No, not at all. Who knows how much she suffered to get like that with her own children. My dad said that, at nights they would get her naked and tied her up to a pole to… What is it? I grabbed that thing and everything fell off. - Are you OK? - What did you break now, fats? - What's this? - I don't know, it was in there. It looks like some kind of game. Let's see. The old woman played games. Stop calling her old woman. You never knew her like I did. She was a real lady, super pretty and really smart… up until she got sick. That is called Stockholm's Syndrom, Ari. Fats, you have no clue, it's called skin cancer. What? I hate you. That's it. Let's see what this is all about. It's a board game, I call dibs on red. You don't even know what it is. I want red. I guess these are the instructions… I don't know what it says here. Fats, what does it say there? - How could I possibly know? - All nerds can speak Chinese, right? Japanese, you moron. I can read Japanese, but this isn't japanese, this is bullshit. Go on, fats, see what else is in there. This is written in Spanish. I do speak and read Spanish. Fate can follow two different paths to cause our ruin We refuse the fulfillment of our wishes, or we fulfill them in full, - HFA. - Damn, that's deep. Hush, Weny. Each player must hold their totem and ask for their wish aloud, starting with the words “I wish, I Wish”. Each wish requires a payment and a punishment; If the player makes the payment, their wish will be granted. Otherwise, they will be punished. The game ends when all remaining players have asked for 3 wishes. We can have 3 wishes, people. It's a half assed game, isn't it? How do you know if you never played? Don't be a party pooper, Charly. What do they mean all remaining players? What is that totem thing? I guess it's this shit. They're cute. Green. Go on, sucker, grab it. And how do you turn this shit on? Man! How do we ask for a wish, or what? Look, I'll read it. Each player must hold their totem and ask for their wish aloud, starting with the words “I Wish, I Wish”. Let's see. I wish, I wish… I can become super famous. [Cheat on your boyfriend] No shit. Cheat on your boyfriend. Why? That's the payment to have your wish come true. What if she doesn't do it? She will be punished. And you will cheat on him just for a dumnb game? To be famous. Mummy. Who is that? Mommy Ari, with an O. Yeah, but that's my punishment or what? I guess. I don't get what it means. If you don't make your payment, your mom will punish you. I don't know. This is really weird. Cous, your turn. I still think it's bullshit, but… I wish, I wish… I become a millionaire. [Become a millionaire.] [Steal your mom's purse] What does that mean? So what? All my mom has in her purse is chewing gum and make up. Let's see the punishment. Fiancee How does it know you are engaged? Those are standard answers Weny: Mom, aunt, fiancee... Wen, it's just a game. So is Russian roulette, and I never play. Whatever, I do want to go on. Sure. Since it's Ari who wants to play, you want to play too. If she wants us to take an eye out, you start looking for a fork. I'm off. Wait, Weny, don't leave me here with them. Weny, don't be so short fused. It's just a game, yes? Where are you going? I wish I wish to fuck Ari. What, man? [Fuck with Ari.] [Get her drunk] Jorge asked for a wish. - Listen, Jorge asked for a wish. - No, no, no. Don't pretend now. Come on, man, tell us what you asked for. I asked for Ari's wish to come true. Really? You're so cute, man. And the payment? I must help Ari with her task. What task, man? Her payment for the game. The punishment is coming up. Khucame. What the fuck is Khucame? It's his best friend. A fag then. Jacobo, it's not funny. What? Khucame is also a standard answer, right? Stop it, Weny, I'm sure it's online on Facebook. Stop it, calm down. This is weird, but it's just a cheap board game. We can leave it as is, or we can end the game. We have no obligation. - Forget it and let's go. - I say we should finish it. I say that too. Fats? This game is just bullshit. Why don't you say you are afraid, you fag? Chicken. Chicken McFly. No one calls me a chicken. I wish, I wish… to have Bruce Lee's body. Blowing on the back of your neck. Bastards. [Destroy your Hellboy] How can I destroy my Hellboy? [Dad] Wen, Wen, its' just silly stuff. Steal a purse, burn an action figure down... It's not an action figure, you idiot. It's a comic book signed by Guillermo del Toro and Mike Mignola. No shit, man. Mike Miyola, that is great. What Miyola, you moron? It's Migno... Turn that thing off already, please. Calm down, Wen. It's really weird, so what? We already started playing and nothing happened… except for the names this thing gave us, and that's all. - Nothing else. - Yep. Wen, what's the worst thing that can happen. Jacobo burning a comic book up, or Ari cheating on her guy? Yes, Wen, you're the only one left. Here's your totem. No, I won't. Wen… Think of something you want to see happening with all your heart. Imagine if it really comes true. I wish, I wish… that my mom gets cured. [Mom gets cured] [Destroy her Holly Virgin Mary Idol] What? Not that guys. They ask silly things from you, but they ask me to do that... No. No, no, no. Not my Olivia. Wen, nothing will happen to your dog, ok? Don't make a scene. What is this shit? Are you all right? Let me see your hand. It hurts. Who is it? The moving guys! - Fuck it! - No shit! No, guys. That was scary. Someone has a napkin? Dumb game, we will just get tetanus from it. Or even worse, AIDS. Enough. Take your shit and let's go. Damn, that was a dumb game. I can see nothing. I hadn't started the wifi. There it is. Let's play. So, you don't want to have dinner, then, my son. No, mom, thanks. Jorge, honey, will you have something to eat? No, mom, thanks. I'm going to a party with Ari. But don't drive if you're drunk, ok? If you have a few drinks, leave the car there and come back in Uber. Yes, dad, don't worry. - Take care - Jorgito, take a sweatshirt. Woman, leave him alone, he's a grown up already. I don't care, they're my babies. Listen, honey, did you finaly go that bakery I told you? No, mom, Regina wants a cake by Maria Jose de la Torre. Who's that? It's a desserts chef who has a boutique at Polanco. She saw it in a magazine and that's the one she wants. It's a fondant cake with swarosky glass, sugary roses, strawberrys on cream and Swiss chocolate and what not. It must be really expensive. It's not expensive, but mega expensive. - It's like 20 000 pesos - Holy cow! How much? I know, but quality has a cost. Don't worry, son. As soon as I win the lottery I'll give you a few million… to pay for the wedding and then get any house you want. Woman, stop that already. No, but of course. A few weeks ago I dreamt with a handsome old man. With a thick beard, all dressed in white. He came up to me and said my guardian angles had sent him to enlighten me and my family. And, what do you know? I did meet that same old man. - No! - Yes! Maybe it wasn't the same old man. This one was a bit shorter, and a tad slimmer, and damn dirty. And he was out of his head drunk. But he looked a lot like the other one. He offered me a lottery ticket ending in a 2. I couldn't let the chance pass by and I bought it. I have it in my purse, with my St. Anthony efigy. You remember, hon, the one we bought in Puebla? My love, you know how many chances you have to win the lottery? One in millions. Son, keep the faith, don't listen to your father, miracles happen to people sorrounded by kind-hearted people. I called it, I'm winning the lottery. Jacobo! What? Turn that thing off, you won't pay that power bill. I'm not playing. Jacobo! What? You didn't take out the trash. I'll take it out tomorrow. Jacobo! Fucking shit. What is it, dad? Sit down, dinner is ready. Did you go to see my mate yet? No, not yet. Well, when are you going? Tomorrow. It's always tomorrow, tomorrow... You know what? You'll go see him this week, or we'll have it, you and me. You hear? You hear? Dad, I don't want to work there. What do I know about working in silver? You learn. You have spent enough time with those cartoons of yours. And spending my money away with the power for that device you have. What a son I have. If I didn't collect my pension, we would be starving. And what will you do when I die? A big party. And hurry so that you can wash the dishes. Oli, dear, leave your granny alone. Who is the prettiest dog in the whole world? Who is the most beautiful? You... Mom, you had dinner yet? Shall I fix something? No, thanks, honey, I'm not hungry, my stomach is burning. Did you take Oli out? No, I was going to do just that. Come on, Oli. Child, before you go, can you light a candle for my Virgin, please? - Yes, mommy. - Thanks, love. In the name of the father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen… Come, Oli, let's go. [Destroy her Holly Virgin Mary Idol] That dress looks so nice. Thanks a lot, Georgie boy. I didn't see you, but... You look really good. Thanks. By the way, you said you wanted to take a course, or some acting workshop. I don't want to, I'm going to. I'm taking diction classes, then body language. Also a course called “to be or not to be”, which is so much for artists. And I want to take singing lessons. I don't just want to be an actress, I also want to be a singer. I don't know, Georgie boy, some times I feel I have so much to say. For instance, yesterday I was watching this YouTube video of a girl singing opera… …and I started singing at the same time, and we were singing almost the same. I was born with it. It's in my blood. Yes, it's in your blood. I see people so unimportant and ugly where I should be. I don't get it, because they're fat, or ugly, or brown... They have nothing on me, Georgie. Yes, totally unimportant. I know, it pisses me off. Can you give me a cig? In the glove compartment. You don't have a lighter? I see, I'll take it... What did you think of the game? Wouldn't it be incredible if your wishes came true? - It would be truly ama... - Imagine I become like super famous. You would cheat on your guy? It's her sister Martha. Martha is the cat lover I told you about. And I need to become her friend right now and start something with her… …because she has a lot of followers. It's incredible. Ari, but you don't even like cats. Cats are horrible, so what? No shit, that's Quique Clorio. And? It's an amazing producer. It's fate, Torch. He produces what? Babe, really? He produces the best soaps in Mexico. - And what if he does? - Tonight's my night. - What for? - To be famous. Excuse me, girls. Sorry, sorry. I thought we came here together. But of course, you silly. At least introduce me to him, so that he knows you're not here alone. No, George, no. I can take care of myself, silly. And don't play jealous or I'll go home by myself. - Hey. - Son Damn, I almost shit myself. Sorry, son. You forgot the tupperware your mom made for you. I know, dad. I just don't like noodles. You know your mom. Take it and give it to your building's doorman or something. I don't know. But bring the tupperware back. Ok, dad. Well, I'm off. - Be careful, champ. - Yes - It's hot, really hot. - Hold on. My arm, you moron. You're and idiot. Sorry, dad. Are you OK? Yes. Well, dad, I'm off. Call me when you want to get out. Sure. Get the fat hot to rub my feet with, I'm in pain. Yes dad. I'm not feeling well. Easy, easy, it's all right. Call my cousin. Don't worry, he went to the store. He won't be long. Let's get you into bed. Come on, baby. Oli, no, no, no. Oli… Olivia… Olivia… Olivia?… Oli?… Olivia… Olivia. Oli?… Olivia. Olivia. Oli… Oli come here. Oli, no. Damn it. Holy shit! Here you are, I found you. Come on, come on, come on. Now. So.. Where… are you? No, get away from me! No, no, no. Hon, what happened? Hon! The pills, my purse… It was all here. Where's my purse? Ain't you cute? [Cheat on your boyfriend] [Become famous] Bullshit! [Destroy your Hellboy 1] [Dad] Jacobo! Hi, I missed you so much. I only went to the restroom, silly. I know, but it seemed for ever. Baby. So, what do you want? I feel like a light chai latte, with lactoseless milk, - because I'm super intolerant. - I'll get the brickie that lives indise me. With cream caramel… whipped cream… Girl, you take it so good. And with chocolate sparks. What a sweet crack. Damn shitheads. Fuck off. Easy, easy, easy. I can't take it anymore, you know? I know. I swear… I had to close my accounts on facebook, Instagram, Twitter. People are bad, George. Then my friends laugh at me and at the same time they're angry because I wouldn't denounce it to the police… but I just want it to be over. I swear it will be all right. In a few weeks time it will be forgotten. One day the president will say some shit and no one will remember you or the damn video. The president and his nonsense. You're incredible, you know? I swear I don't know what I would have done all this time without you. - I even thought of killing myself. - No, don't say that. You and I will always be together. Mom, stop crying. How, honey? I'm dying inside without your dad… - I killed him, it's my fault. - No, no, no. - Please, forgive me. - No, mom. Don't say that, please. Yes, it was my fault. - I had never lost a purse. - I know, I know. I swear I left it on the counter. Excuse me. Please, sign here and here… …and your full name with your signature in the last page. Ok. [Insurance: $5 000 000] Thank you. This is your check. I'm so sorry for your loss. If you excuse me. I'll walk you out. Charly? Fats. We have to talk. I know. The game is real. The game works. What? What do you mean, fats? It's true, tell them, fats. You guys remember what I asked for? No. It doesn't matter. But you do remember that for each wish, there is a payment… …and a punishment. My payment was destroying my hellboy. And my punishment was dad. Olivia. My punishment read Olivia. So what? My punishment was my mom, and she's ok. Because you cheated on your boyfriend. I did nothing, you moron… that guy raped me. You seduced him. And you became famous… I found the video in Porntube. It has over 1 million plays. And I even found memes. I asked to be a millionaire… and I just got my dad's life insurance. What was your payment? I stole my mom's purse, because there was a lottery ticket in it, and I thought... The purse. You killed my dad. No, it wasn't me. It was this fucking shit of a game. It's all real. George, what did you ask for? I wish, I wish for my dad to be alive. What are you doing, you fuck? [Take Wendy's eye out] What? Shit, shit... What the fuck? No, my brother no. Fats, what did you do? You're an asshole, how could you...? Sorry, sorry. Shit. I don't wanna be here any longer. - What's going on? - Ari come back. Calm down, Ari, you can't go alone. - Leave her alone, idiot. - Give me the keys. - What keys? I didn't lock the door. - Give me the damn keys. - I didn't lock it. - Who was it then? I don't want to play anymore. Help, please, someone help us. I found two more. What happened? Nothing, no cell signal, no Internet, nothing. It's all locked. Doors, windows, the roof, the yard... We'll never get out of here. No, no, we have to wait. I'm sure someone will come for us in the morning. What's that? What's that? What's going on Fats? I don't know, I didn't do anything. It's counting, it's waiting for something... The remaining players. But, what do we do, what do we ask, what do we do Jacobo? Why asking me? I don't know what to fucking do. I wish, I wish to get out of here. [Forgive Jorge] Forgive you for what? I don't know. Jorge, forgive you for what? What did you do to me? I don't know. Shit. What did you do to me, Jorge? I don't know, Ari. Tell me. I didn't do shit, I don't get what the damn game wants. I don't know what you did to me, but the game does, and it won't end if you don't tell me, Jorge. I wissh, I wish for the game to be over. Fucking hell, stop making wishes. [Kill them all] What? Kill us all? Of course I'm fucked! Either Weny will kill me or the game will. What did you do to me, Jorge? Nothing. Why does the game say that? I don't know, Ari, I don't know why the game says that. Apologise to her already, you moron. Jorge, man up, you fuck. I'm sorry I farted in the car. Jorge, for fuck's sake. You did something to me, didn't you? Jorge, you did something to me. Damn, no, what are you talking about? You did something to me, you did something to me. What are you talking about? I wish, I wish to get Ari's forgiveness. [Confess everything] Ari, open up. We're screwed. Hello, Miss Ari. You don't talk to me anymore, now that you're famous. Ari. Ari, open up! Ari. Ari, open up! Ari, open up! Jorge, Jorge, the payment. Confess whatever you did to her, just tell her. No. Ari! Tell her, don't be an asshole! Or she will be fucked up. I can't, she will hate me. Jorge, tell her. Ari, open up. Let me see your kittie. Jorge! Jorge! Ari! Confess, you asshole. I was there when you were raped. I was there and I did nothing. I was in the closet and I didn't stop him. What? I confessed already, I confessed already. No. Jorge, Jorge. You want a sting? OK Jorge, focus, say everything you need to say. You confessed it all?	; Think, you idiot, think. What else should she forgive you for? Jorge, Ari is dying. You want her to die, Jorge? Ari, Ari, are you ok? Ari, are you ok? Ari. Ari, what happened? Are you ok? Listen, help me. Look, help me there, help me. Easy, easy, easy. Watch it, fats, watch it. Easy, Ari. The other leg. Come, stand up. Easy. Here, sit down. apply real pressure on it. Ari, listen. Jorge, leave her alone. You'd better go find something to clean her wound with. Just don't bring any alcohol, in case you want to rape us all. Hush, shut up, fats. I didn't rape her, I made love to her. You're a sick fuck.	; Your parents spoilt you. Don't blame me if you're angry because your life sucks. Jorge. You always envied me and my brother. You had envy 'cause our parents gave us everything and you lived in a pigsty. You are just envious. It's not my fault your mom died. It's not my fault either that you had to live with that bitter crazy dada of yours. And then you killed him. Who will love you now? Tell me, tell me! You stink. You're a stinking nerd! You suck! You're a shit of a person. You will stay alone for ever, Fats. Jorge… We must find something to clean Ari's wound with. Jacobo. Jacobo. Go to the kitchen and see if you can find something, anything. Come on. Go. I promise you we'll get out of here. I found this. There's nothing in the kitchen. Useless idiots. Charly. [Take out Weny's eye.] Fuck! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! - What is that? - Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! No, Charly. No, no. I wish, I wish for my brother to live. [Help Jacobo - Weny] Fats, take Weny's eye out, don't let that thing kill my brother. Let it kill him. It's what the pig deserves. Weny, if you don't let him take your eye out, that thing will come for you anyway. Fats, please, don't let this shit kill my brother. Let him save himself, see if the fucker can make it. Weny, I'll take you to the hospital, I'll take you to the best hospital of all, I swear. I will even give you money, I'll give you all the money my dad left me, Weny, please... Time is up, fats. No, no, please. [Help Jacobo For Jorge to live] Thanks, fats, thanks. Fuck it, I didn't do it for you two. [For my dad to be alive] Easy, Weny, easy. - Shut up, let me go. - Leave her! Jacobo! Jacobo! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! No, no, no. Dad, dad! No, you son of a bitch. It's gonna be all right, Weny. You're all right, Weny, we'll take you to the hospital, I swear. You're all right, you're all right. What did I miss? Jaco. Jacobo. Jacobo. You're shaking. Thank you, Weny. Jorge, we have to get out of here. We can't. There must be a way. It can't be done. It can't if you just stay still in your seat. Let's go up and look for a way out, through the roof or, I don't know, through the window. In a second. - Bro. - In a second, damn it. Fuck you, man. Shit. How are you feeling? It's gonna be all right. You're in shock, it's normal if... You're the worst thing that ever happened to me. Please, forgive me. Really? No, I'll never forgive you. No, no. Where are you, where are you? Here you are. Come on! Come on! No, no, open up. No, no, Jacobo. Jacobo. Open up, open up. Open up, fuck it. It's fucking locked. Jacobo! Jacobo! Dad? Son! Jacobo! What the fuck is that? Dad? Jacobo help me! Dad? Dad! Dad? Dad? [Do you want to leave?] [Kill Them All] Ari, no, you will kill him. Yes, that's the idea. Ari, stop it. Please! Ari! Ari, stop! Ari don't. I'm sorry, Wen, but I want to go already. Weny. Cousin! Come… Cousin! Weny… Weny… Weny… Weny… I just heard you. I wish I wish for my husband to forget it all. I wish I wish for Lucas to be a good man. I wish I wish to win this game. I wish I wish to be inmortal. Honey! Pedro! Can I have one?
