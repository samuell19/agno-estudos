Poets. Geniuses. Revolutionaries. Lemonade Mouth has been called all of these things. But the real story, the story of how our band came to be... Is a mystery to them all. I wonder if they'd believe it... If I told them that it all started... ♪ Ooh, yeah! Mmm, breakthrough ♪ ...right here. The rules in here are simple. No eating. No drinking. No sleeping. No talking. No tapping. No texting. You break a rule, I add another day of detention. Are we clear? Great. Stella Yamada. Lead guitar. Wen Gifford. Keyboard. Mo Banjaree. Bass. Charlie Delgado. Drum god. And me. Olivia White. Future front man for Lemonade Mouth. One, two, three, four, five. It was this ragtag group of five that started it all. All right, I have decided, rather than let you twiddle your little thumbs for the next hour, we are going to put those thumbs to use! We're gonna clean up around here, we're gonna unpack, and we're gonna turn this storage room into a music room! I mean, we might as well make the best of it, right? We've been banished to the basement. Did you hear that? Ooh! You know what? If they spent a fraction of what that new gymnasium cost to keep this music program alive, I... Oh! That is it. That is it! But, if I'm gonna tell you this right, I need to go back to the beginning. The morning it all began. Let's go, Stell. You don't wanna be late for your first day, do you? Look, I know this is hard. Transferring to a new school a month into the year? Yeah. Yeah. Why would that be hard? Stella! Stella! But, who cares, right? I care. Then you and Dad might've thought to ask me before you moved our family halfway across the country. Hold that thought. Hello? Yes, Mr. Johnson. The bio-plastic certification document... Whoa! Check out the new girl. Nice hair. Have fun. Hey, Dad, don't you think it's a little weird that your girlfriend's still in college? She's 28, Wen. She's just taking a photography course. Look, Dad, when guys go through mid-life crisis, they buy a sports car, right? Well, what do you say, Dad? We turn in the old truck? Get a sports car? I would fully support that. Give Sydney a chance. For me. Why is everything about Sydney? "Sydney wants Chinese food." "Let's watch Sydney's favorite show." "Can't pick you up from piano practice. Sydney called." Hey, I apologized for that. Yeah, I know. You know, whatever, all right. Let's just go. I'm gonna be late for my history presentation. Mmm-hmm. Sorry. Are you excited, Charles? Soccer tryouts are today. Oh. Right. Yeah, um... I'm thrilled. Oh, your mother... We. Thought you might like to have this with you today, for luck. It was your brother's. Tommy scored the winning goal at state finals with that ball. Oh! Mom, what're you crying for? Tommy's just away at college. I... Oh. Whoa, whoa! Remember, Mohini, you need to speak to your teachers about extra credit. Get your GPA up for the college applications. But that's a couple of years away. I... It's never too soon to think about your future, Mon... Understand? Yes, Baba. Is that... That lipstick you're wearing? No, Baba. Because you're too young for that sort of thing. Yes, Baba. I'm late. Bye, Baba. Monu. Don't forget. Extra credit! Please don't see me. Please don't see me. Yeah, you know it. Way to go, Olivia. And one last reminder to show some school spirit this weekend... Hey! There you are. Hey, Scott! You scared me. Well, I've been looking all over for you. So, uh, the band and I, we're gonna ditch this morning. Head on over to Ray's and practice for the Halloween Bash. Wanna come? Sure, I'd love... I can't. What? Come on, Mo. We barely see each other as it is. Well, maybe this Saturday. I'll tell my dad that I've got extra credit or... No, you know, I got, I got Mudslide Crush rehearsals all weekend. Plus, soccer practice. Come on. Just this once? For me? Don't worry about Brenigan, all right? He's with the new girl. Well, I think that Stella's still working through some anger issues about moving. Yes, I can see that. But, I'm afraid that shirt is... What? Is there a dress code here? Well. No. But, there is an unwritten line, and that shirt crosses it. What about freedom of expression? Do you have that here? Stella. Just... Cover up for the day, okay? Stella, is it? I run a tight ship here. I don't know how they did things back in Rhode Island, but at my school, students respect the rules. Written and unwritten. Come on, come on. Please don't call my dad. He doesn't even want me alone with a boy. If he found out that I skipped class with one, he'd never let me out of the house. This is your first infraction. You are on the honor roll. I won't call your father... Thank you. This time. But if I ever catch you skipping class again... You won't! I promise! That's why the American Revolution was so important. Thank you, Sharon. Very nice. All right. Wendell. You're up! No... We're waiting. Only one second, sir. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This can't be happening. Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt. Wen, I have your folder. Check out Wen's mommy. You must be Wendell's mother. No, I'm... She's not my mom, okay? Are you kidding me? Look at her, all right. Are you stupid? Oh. So? Detention. Ouch. But, at least we'll be together, right? Right? No. He actually let me off with a warning. A warning? Yeah. You know, I got, um, soccer practice and big games coming up. I just can't miss 'em. But, uh, I'll see you at lunch, okay? Yeah, sure. All right. Unbelievable. What can I tell you, Jenny? That you'll put the same value on the arts as you do sports. You've cut the music budget to zero. You've moved my classroom down to the basement. And for what? Some gymnasium? Whoa! This is not "some gymnasium." Sports bring donors. Yeah, I... What? Donors bring money. And money makes my school run. "Your school"? Times are tough, Jenny. Someone's gotta make the hard decisions around here and that someone is moi. "I'm nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody, too?" Well, that would be a "yes." Here we go! Hustle up! Move it. Move it! Come on, let's make a move. Ray! Cut it out, dude! Keep it going, keep it going. Delgado, come on! Get with the program! See you later. Hey. Come on, what are y'all doing? Let's go, Delgado. Come on, now. All right, guys, you all set up for drill number two. Let's go. Hustle up. Coach. Come on, kids! Drill number two. On drill two, kids. Come on! Are you sure that's Tommy Delgado's brother? Yeah. No, no, Delgado. You gotta kick the ball. Like that! That's it. You know what? I don't wanna play soccer, I don't want your abuse, and I certainly don't want my brother's ball. Ooh. I think he did that on purpose, Coach. Turbo Blast! Turbo Blast! Welcome to our first assembly in our new gym, generously funded by our school sponsor, Turbo Blast. Drink of champions! Yeah! Whoo! You're the man, Brenigan! That's good for now. Thanks. Our assembly today is about... Are you ready? Personal empowerment! Hi. Hi. Dig deep inside... Why don't you, uh, find another seat? Why don't you make me? Ooh! ...excel not only on the field, they excel in life. All right, move it. Come on. What a freak! A student who is willing to take risks. An empowered student. And by empowerment, I mean going above and beyond what's expected. You want empowered students? Now, I know it's all within you, and you know it is as well. Then you're gonna get 'em. My shirt, my decision! Oh, just sit down! Okay, don't let your school take away your rights! Okay, be heard! Use your voice! Come on! He can't tell you what to wear, who to be! Let's go. You can wear what you want! We can wear whatever we want! Whoo! Come on! Sit down! I can wear my own T-shirt! Wear whatever kind of shirt you want. Today, tomorrow... Get ready, get ready. Defense, push 'em back! Defense, push 'em back! Defense, push 'em back! Way back! Defense, push 'em back! Defense, push 'em back! Defense, push 'em back! Way back! You lost? Oh. No. I'm just... Detention, huh? Follow me. What is this place? This is the underground. Robotics club. Hey, Alex, working hard? Hi. Shakespeare society. Chess club. He hasn't found a partner in months. Ballet. And one and two. Pas de chat! Mathletes. Art club. Even the school newspaper. Victoria, you doing good? Anything that doesn't fit Principal Brenigan's mold, you'll find it down here. Oh, there's my stop. AV Club. You're telling me Brenigan just stuck your clubs in the basement? Pretty much. Unless you're wearing a varsity jacket or a cheer skirt around here, you're basically... Invisible. See? You're catching on already. Detention's at the end of the hall. Good luck. No, guys, you keep doing this wrong. There is a moment... where the stars align. And fates collide. Creating that perfect union... Hmm. Mmm. Hmm. This was that moment. I am going to go give Brenigan a piece of my mind. And while I do, I want you guys to just start cleaning up or something around here. She can't make us clean. It's cruel and unusual punishment. Welcome to high school. This school stinks. Can you guys just do what Miss Reznick asked, and be quiet, okay?

You can show everyone around here that sports isn't the only thing that matters. So... What do you think? You in? Pass. What? It's ridiculous. Okay. I really can't. Between my AP classes and violin lessons... Yeah. I've got... Stuff. Stuff. Okay, well then, what about you, Olivia? I don't sing. Uh, we just heard you sing. Well, yeah, but that wasn't real, like on a stage. I can't do that. Oh, come on. Sure you can. No, no. Trust me, it wouldn't be pretty. The last time I performed on stage was my first grade recital, and five minutes into Ba-Ba Black Sheep I threw up down Mikey Nichols' back. Yeah, I remember that. That was hilarious. No. It was humiliating. I'm sorry, I can't. Well, I guess that counts me out, right? Can't really enter a competition with one man in a band. You know, unless you're thinking of a solo career. Which I would be happy to consider. Guys, Mudslide Crush are entering. We wouldn't have a shot. He's right. They're amazing. They're not that amazing. Well, if we don't stand a chance against these Mudslide guys, then why bother, right? Because you said it yourself. You deserve to be heard. Gram? Gram? Hey. Oh! Olivia! Sweetie. Oh, how's Nancy doin'? Oh, she still hasn't eaten. Nancy. Come here. You need to eat. You need to eat, old girl. Come on, girl. Come on, look. Yum. Yuck, Dad. How can you eat that? When did you become a vegetarian? Yeah, when did, this happen? Four months ago. Wow. For a bunch of geniuses, you people don't pay very good attention. Sorry I'm not out inventing biodegradable plastic, or making my own toys, or, oh, yeah, curing cancer. We haven't cured it yet, honey. Hello! I know that. I may not be a genius, which is, like, I don't know, a genetic abnormality in this family. But, I can do things too, you know? I could start a revolution. That's, uh, nice, dear. Good morning, Mesa High. Yes, it's that time of year again. You have to get out there and vote, because, guess what? Yes, I have been nominated, yet again, for School Administrator of the Year. So, let's keep that winning streak alive, shall we? Okay. Key vote today, polls are open all day long. There's extra credit involved. You think it's about the band? Oh, my! We talked about this. It's not gonna happen. Sure it is. I signed us up for Rising Star this morning. Check, check. One, two. Check. Oh, we're not experienced enough. Which is why I also signed us up for Halloween Bash. Stella. What? Well, how'd you pull that off? It's amazing what a principal will agree to if he thinks his new "problem student" is channeling her energy into something productive. Stella, goofing around in detention does not make us a band. So, we'll practice. You have real drums, right? Yeah. See? I didn't even know that. Okay, so what are we gonna play? You could write our songs. Me? Yeah. That one you did the other day was pretty amazing. Mmm-hmm. That was nothing, I... I think I'm gonna be sick. Wait. We can't play the Bash. Mudslide Crush is playing. And we are opening for them. Yeah. I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I don't want to be some random face in a yearbook or a kid people vaguely recall passing in the halls. I want to be heard. Wen and I are in. Who's with us? I'll give it a shot. Really? Yeah? But only if everyone else agrees. Just one practice. If it works, great. If not, I'm out. All right. Okay. Hmm-mmm. Come on. Say you'll try. Please. It'll be fun. It'll be so much fun. Pretty, pretty please. Sugar on top! You will have so much fun! Oh! Okay, okay. I'll do it. Yes! Yes! It'll be great. You know what? Heads, we do it. Tails, we don't. One of the misconceptions about Lemonade Mouth is that we were a natural fit from the start. Totally not true. Come on, Charlie! It's a simple four-four beat. You're not even trying. It's B to B-flat, back to B, then an F-sharp. Ready? Okay, this isn't working! We'll get it. We just need to keep practicing. Also, maybe we need to go a little more hardcore. That's it. I'm out of here. What? You're just gonna stomp away? No, come on. Don't leave. In case you guys hadn't realized, I'm classically trained. On the violin. I don't play whatever this is. I'm out, too. What? Guys, look, come on, we can work this out. Yeah! Yeah, Wen's right. Maybe if we just take it from the top one more time? They're quitting before we've even started! They're quitters!

I mean, I'm the... I'm the man. All right. Hey! What's up? I didn't think you were gonna make it. So, uh, how'd you get out the house? Um, I told my dad I had a study group. Oh. I mean... I mean, what does Brenigan expect me to do? Jump up and down? Like, "Oh, I get to play half my set?" No! What's Ray talking about? Eh, it's nothing. Come on, don't worry about it. Just tell me. Brenigan told us we don't get a full set at the Halloween Bash. So... So, you know that new girl, Stella? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, well I guess she told Brenigan she has some band and Miss Reznick is in on it. Miss Reznick is a really talented music teacher... Yeah, whatever. I mean, that's not the point. The point is this so-called band has half our stage time, now. It's nuts. You don't cancel the Crush. Do you know who else is in the band? Nope. Just a bunch of nobodies. It's me. What? I'm in the band. I play bass. I mean, you're kidding, right? No. Actually, we're not bad. I mean, we met in detention. We're just opening for you. Look, Mo, I mean, if you want to be in the band, that's great. You could play back-up guitar for me or something. But, come on. Joining the band that's taking half our night from us? What's up with that? What? So, now it's your night? Yeah. I mean, my music it's... It's important to me. You know that! Well, maybe my music is important to me, too. I'm sure it is. It's just... Just think about it, okay? I mean, I really don't want this to come between us. Me either. Uh, it's... Good, good. Now, I'll be back in a little bit, okay? I'm taking that band down, one way or another. Okay? Ray, we're up my man. All right, let's do this thing. Let's do it. Yeah!

Thank you for coming out! Woo! What's going on? Mudslide Crush. They're mad we cut their show short. So? So, they're the cool guys. The pride of Mesa High. And what are we? We are rash-like. Persistent. Hmm! Excellent! After you. Okay, yesterday. Yeah. Oh! Oops. Okay. I see everyone brought their official underworld badges. Yeah. Yeah! We're subterranean and we're proud! Yeah. Mmm. Ew! All right. First order of business, a band name. We need one for the fliers. Okay, okay. What about Soul Groove? Uh-uh. No. Oh! The Anarchists? Nah. But that's not so bad. The Anarchists! No. No, I don't like... Oh, no. You're right. It's terrible. I'm gonna go get another lemonade. All right, look, guys, uh, I got one. Um, let me, let me just find it... Wen! Wen? He's kidding, right? Come on, it's the whole one name thing, you know like, um... Like Bon Jovi. Mmm. Or Cher. Back off the Bash! What kind of band name is that? I love it. No. This was on the door. Good morning. Over the weekend I was notified that there was gum found underneath the seats of the new bleachers in the gym. This is a personal affront to me. I've assigned seven students... You haven't called me back. Sorry. You know, I've just been distracted. I've got band rehearsals, soccer practice. I mean, you know how it is, right? Okay, is that what this is about? The band? No, uh, no... That is all. You know, I gotta go. I'll call you. All right? Sure you will. If a guy doesn't call for a few days, should the girl worry? Do guys do that? You're a guy, right? Wow! No, I just mean, like, you're my friend. You're not, like, a guy-guy. Yeah, that's not really helping. What's up? Hey. Am I interrupting? Thanks! My favorite. Could I just have... So, hey, uh, you're the lead singer of the new band, right? Yeah. Oh, then why don't you just belt one out for us? Show us what you got. Okay, could you just leave me alone? What's going on? We're just making small talk. Ray, come on, bro, just leave her alone. Oh, and you gonna make me? You're being a creep, Ray. So, if you're not gonna make me, then who's gonna make me? Me! That's who! You? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah! Can't we talk this through? No, we can't talk it through. No! Okay. Wen, Wen! Wen. Yeah? A little help here, please. No, no, no. I'm a lover, not a fighter. Perfect. Yeah. Go help him. Yeah. Can you just, like, make it quick? Make it quick? Yeah. No. Let's go. I have a better idea. What? One second. Oh! You think it's funny? Oh, no. It's not funny. No! No! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Break it up, here. Break it up. Step away from the puddle, people! What is going on here? Principal Brenigan, I went to go get a Turbo Blast and they just start threatening... Next thing you know it, lemonade mouth over here spits all over me. And that is how we got our band name. Hey. What are you doing here? Stella said I should come by, work on some songs with you. Oh. Okay. So, uh... Oh! Right. Sorry. Um... Come on in. All right. Wow. Thanks, Gram. Mmm-hmm. So, you're Olivia's friend? That's right. I've never met one of Olivia's friends before... Mmm, Gram... She was just kidding about the whole friend thing. She's met a ton of my friends. Like tons and tons of friends... Right. Of course. You wanna hear a rap? Yes. Yes. All right, um... "It's Wen and I'm musically inclined. "Get a shiver down your spine every time I rhyme. "I'm in Lemonade Mouth, we don't learn to wait. "We get on stage and determinate." It would keep going... Determinate? Yeah. It's like, get determined. Like, put on your game face. You know, it's... Oh, I'm sorry. That is so not what determinate means. Wow. That is an old cat. Yeah. Yeah, she's really old. Are you okay? Yeah, um... Nancy was my mom's and so she's just kind of, the last real thing I have left of her. So... Oh, I'm sorry. Well, what about your dad? He... Um, you know what? Can we just work on the songs? Yeah. 'Cause I, have this one that I think is pretty good. So, um, here. Right. Okay. ♪ Trying hard to fight these tears ♪ I'm crazy worried ♪ Messing with my head this fear ♪ I'm so sorry Is that my line? ♪ You know you gotta get it out ♪ I can't take it ♪ That's what being friends is about ♪ I like when you smile. Sorry, uh... No, um... Right, so... Yeah, we should... It basically it just picks up a little bit and we go through, like, this slow portion of the song, right? And then I was thinking that... Well, this is it, guys. Our last rehearsal. I hope. Guys, I can't believe the Halloween Bash is tomorrow night. And Rising Star in a few weeks. You okay? Fine. I'm fine. I'm totally fine. We're all nervous, Olivia. Try terrified. Hey, come on, you guys. We're gonna be great. In fact, I think I know just the thing to make us feel better. Ah. Lemonade! I'd like to know what's happening to the lemonade machine in the basement. There's a lemonade machine down there? Yeah. For now. And I'd like to know why it's being removed. Hey, uh, we were just wondering if it's gonna be replaced or repaired. You know, any information you have, we would really appreciate it. Well, I'm sure it's just a mix-up. See? Just relax. Oh... Oh, well. Well, that machine should've been gone ages ago. Well, what with Principal Brenigan's sponsorship deal. Wait, a sponsorship? Turbo Blast donated the gym and the scoreboard, and we have to get rid of any competing drink machines. What? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Now, I don't care for your tone, young lady. I suggest, if you have any more questions, you bring them up to Principal Brenigan yourself. It's okay. Relax. Yeah, so like I was saying, Maureen, he told me I looked nice and he smiled at me. I'm not going down without a fight. Look, it's just a machine, Stella. No, it's not. It's more than that! Afternoon, students. Are we having a good day? Yeah. Thank you, Faye. Hey there, buddy. You're home early. Yeah, practice sort of got canceled. What's all this? Sydney's stuff. What's it doing here? Look, I know this has been tough for you. Mom leaving, me moving on. But, whatever issues you're having with Sydney, we have to figure them out because she makes me happy, Wen. Yeah. And I've asked her to marry me. Wen. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Hey, Mo. What's up with you? Nothing. Hey, have you seen the new weight room? What? Oh, okay. You gotta check it out. It's really great. Okay... So, how's that whole band thing working out for you? Yeah, it's great. Um... Yeah? Ray, what are you up to? Can you tell I've been working out? Seriously, I don't have time for your games. Hey, Mo. Uh, you know Jules, right? Yo, wait, Mo! Let her go. She's made her choice. Hey, good luck tonight. She promised she'd be here. Maybe she just got held up. We're on in 10 minutes. I can't find her anywhere. I don't have time. Those Mudslide jerks wrecked my setup before sound check. I'm telling you, it's sabotage. Doesn't matter. We can't go on without a lead singer. Who, Olivia? She ran through here a couple minutes ago. What? That way. Looked like she was gonna hurl. So, think those lemon heads are bailing on you, Mr. B. They are? Yeah, you know, we got two sets ready. We'd be happy to go on early and cover. Uh-huh. Hmm. Give me one second. Jenny. Huh? Oh. Do I need to be worried? Huh? Oh, no. They'll be fine. They'll be ready. Oh, look at that costume over there. Who's that? Are you in here, Olivia? Olivia? Oh, sorry, Jenna. Found her! I'm going in. Can't just go... I'm going. We're coming in! Girls' bathroom! How you feeling, Olivia? I'm great! Super! That's my girl! That's great. But, it's probably, it's probably... Not the best idea for me to actually go out there, you know, physically. We've got plenty, thank you. Maybe next door. Sorry.

Everybody, we want you to pass these back! So hurry up. Pass 'em back! We'd like to shine a light on a recent change that affects us all. We'd like to talk about... Lemonade! Now, the Mel's lemonade machine in the basement is scheduled for removal to help pay for this gymnasium. It's about this school, is treating certain people like they matter more than others. Or like funding for sports is more important than a music program. Or a school newspaper, or any one of us. Do you know about this? We all deserve to be treated like we matter. Because, ladies and gentlemen... We do matter! ♪ Be heard, be strong, be proud ♪ I wanna make some noise ♪ Stand up, come on, be loud ♪ We gotta raise our voice ♪ Come on, come on, come on ♪ You gotta hear me now, you gotta hear me now, you gotta hear me now ♪ Hey now, we no longer wait around ♪ My team stronger like weights now ♪ Keeps on growing, our muscle keeps on showing ♪ We came here to make a change ♪ We came here to rearrange, We came here 'cause we believe ♪ We came here 'cause we achieve, yeah ♪ While I got the microphone, make sure how I feel is known ♪ All for one we rock the zone , how I feel to each his own ♪ All my people treat 'em right ♪ We reserve the right to fight ♪ For what we want For what we need ♪ To the front We shall proceed ♪ Here we come ♪ And we're ready to go, go, go ♪ And you'd better run ♪ 'Cause we don't take no, no, no, come on ♪ Be heard Be strong Be proud Stop!

You're very talented. Very. But just for your information, a high school dance is no place for a political tirade. What you did Friday night was completely, completely disruptive. And you. You promised there would be no funny business. But it wasn't funny. Ha! We just spoke our minds. And, Principal Brenigan, you shut us down. Yes, I shut you down, because the decisions I make are for the good of this school. Okay? And, with that good in mind... Lemonade Mouth is finished. You will not use the music room. You will not use the instruments. If I hear so much as a hum coming from the locker room showers, I will suspend you. Understood? Good. Dismissed. Psst. What's this? It's you. Your show. Listen, a bunch of kids have been asking if they can buy them. I hope you don't mind, but I've already sold, like, five copies, 10 bucks a pop. I figure, you know, A/V Club gets 30% and you take the rest. Deal? Yeah. Excellent. This year's Halloween Bash will best be remembered for the powerful performances by surprise stand-out. Lemonade Mouth. A champion for students sidelined by the high school privileged and elite. Can you believe it? Our first review. And last, apparently. I think they like us. I'm not sure it's "us" they like, Charlie. What do you mean? Come on, bro. Never mind. Never mind. Lemonade Mouth. Oh! Hey. Hi. Hey. Hey, Olivia. Hi. Oh, sorry. Sorry, Alex. Hi. That's Lemonade Mouth. Can you believe that? I know. Oh, my gosh. Pull it down. Pull it down. Just yank it right off the... Hey! Stella. Come here. Now, I thought I'd made myself clear. This Lemonade business is over. It wasn't us. You're playing a dangerous game here, Miss. We had nothing to do with that. And you're gonna lose. Hector, it is not a pinata. Don't poke it. Hit it! Take it down! What would you say... If, um, we told you we could play again? What? I'd say you're nuts. Brenigan is never gonna change his mind. We're not talking about at school. We're talking about here. Here? Mmm-hmm. Look, guys, I gave Dante our CD. And he loved it. Yeah, and he said we could start playing here. See, Principal Brenigan, he can tell us we can't play at school, but he can't tell us not to play here. And it could become a regular gig. Wait, wait, wait. A regular gig? I barely made it through the first one. Guys, my parents already think I'm at soccer practice every afternoon. There's no way I can pull this off. Me either. Scott eats here, and I'm pretty much planning on not seeing him again for the rest of my life. Guys, we mean something to people. Lemonade Mouth is their voice. It's like we're at the center of a movement here. - Hi. - Maybe if... Guys, good luck with your movement. But I've got homework to do. Mo. Let's go. Mo, you okay? Whoa! No way. Oh, it's beautiful. Look at us up there. Maybe we do matter. Of course we do. Before we knew it, we were playing at Dante's Pizzeria every Thursday night. Standing room only. We were ready for Rising Star. We were ready to be heard. ♪ Insecure In her skin ♪ Like a puppet, a girl on a string ♪ Broke away Learned to fly ♪ If you want her back Gotta let her shine ♪ So it looks like the joke's on you ♪ 'Cause the girl that you thought you knew ♪ She's so gone ♪ That's so over now ♪ She's so gone ♪ You won't find her around ♪ You can look but you won't see ♪ The girl I used to be ♪ 'Cause she's ♪ She's so gone away like history ♪ She's so gone ♪ Baby, misses me, yeah ♪ She's so gone ♪ That's all over now ♪ She's so gone ♪ You won't find her around ♪ You can look but you won't see ♪ The girl I used to be ♪ 'Cause she's She's so gone ♪ She's so gone That's all over now ♪ She's so gone ♪ You won't find her around ♪ You can look but you won't see ♪ The girl I used to be ♪ 'Cause she's She's so gone ♪ So long She's so gone ♪ Lemonade Mouth was officially a sensation. Will you autograph my CD? And five strangers were suddenly much, much more. We were friends. Can I get your autograph? Hey, would you listen to my demo? Charlie! What's up, guys? Has anyone seen Olivia today? I haven't seen her all day. No? You okay? You came? We all did. Hey. Hey, Olivia. Look, I'm really sorry about Nancy. Yeah, me, too. Hey, it's nice out here. Yeah, um, sometimes I like to look up and see what shapes I can find. You know, in the clouds. It's a giant, old lady with a skirt and an umbrella. Um, see there, uh, there's a flower in a vase. Oh, I see a hand. Nah, you're way off. It's an... It's an alien pushing a baby carriage. All I see is a blob. Sometimes I think I'm too stupid to be in my family. Like, I'm just some big letdown. No wonder my mom ignores me. I wish my dad would ignore me. I'm never gonna live up to this idea he has of this perfect Indian daughter, you know? Try living up to a perfect brother. I'd take perfect brother any day over my dad's ridiculous girlfriend. Oh, my dad's in prison. I'm just... I'm too humiliated to talk to him or about him and... You know, he writes but I don't write back 'cause... I don't know what to say. I mean... He's made some really bad decisions since my mom died, and I still love him but he's... He's a stranger now, you know? Which is why I'm so glad to have this, you know?

Mo, come on, Mo! Can we please just talk? We don't have anything to talk about, Scott. Not anymore. Look, Mo, I made a mistake! Look, Mo. I still have feelings for you. What about Jules? Oh, come on. We're just friends. That's all. The thing is, Scott... I'm not the same girl I was two months ago. Not anymore. I'm not trying to be something that I'm not, you know? Not for anyone. Me, my music, we're a package deal now. Okay, I know. I get that now. I do. And I'm sorry, Mo. I am. Can you forgive me? Of course I can. But, it doesn't change anything between us. Okay? It's gonna take a lot more than "sorry" to fix this. Come on, Mo. Just wait! Mo! The band was, uh... Was originally called "Wen". And I know, but after about months and months of arguing... Wen! Don't you knock? Yes. No. Just... Come on! You've got to hear this! Listen. Your song. It's you! What? Yes! Yes! What? What's going on in here? We're on the radio! Hello? Turn on WRIZ right now! What... Gram. Gram, they're playing our song on the radio. They're playing our song on the radio! Yes! Yes, they are! The radio sponsor for Rising Star heard our demo and put it on the air. It was a dream come true. For all of us. But just when the future looked brightest for Lemonade Mouth, everything started to fall apart. ♪ Won't you sing with me ♪ What is inside of me Mo. Mo, you sure you're okay? Yeah, I think it's just allergies. ♪ Oh, we're gonna let it show Losers! I'm just sayin', I'm gonna take you down at Rising Star tomorrow. You just wait. Just ignore him. ♪ Back our dreams and try to... Hey! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! May I, uh, introduce, Loser Mouth... Gimme that. No! No. No, bro. Gimme the... Hey. Calm down. Yeah! Yeah! Ooh! Uh-oh. Ray is such a jerk. He got what he wanted, didn't he? Dante's not gonna let us play there anymore, that's for sure. You sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little bit tired, that's all. Wait, Mo. There's, um, something I need to tell you. For a long time I've wanted to tell you just, you know, you were with Scott, and then we became friends... I like you, Mo. There, I said it. We're just friends, Charlie. Good friends. That's all. Fine. Charlie, please... No, you know what? "Be heard", it's a stupid song. I'm never singing it again. No, Charlie. No. Don't go! It's time to come in, Mon... You are too young for boys. Charlie is just a friend, Baba. I didn't come to this country and make the sacrifices I made just so that you can throw it all away on boys and rock bands! Charlie is just a friend, okay? And the band... It's nothing. It's just a bit of fun. That's all. What's going on? Baba doesn't trust me. We do trust you, Mon... Do you? That's what I thought. Mohini. Hey. You're burning up. Let's get you to bed. Little to the right. Right. Now, left. There. Good. Thanks for helping. It'll mean a lot to Sydney. You got it. So, Wen... Yeah. I've been meaning to ask you. Will you be my best man? Your what? Ah! Wen, you okay? Lemme see. Mo has a 102 fever, Charlie has three broken fingers. Tomorrow's gonna be a disaster. Well, we'll just call and back out. No, back out of Rising Star? Out of everything we've been through? Whoa. You okay? Yeah. I just get blurry vision sometimes. What do you mean? Oh! Wow. The doctor said it should be gone in a couple days. What happened? Sydney. Sydney did it? Well, Sydney's picture. I was helping my dad hang it up and he asked me to be his best man. Wen! That's great news! No. Okay, that's terrible news. All right, just because Sydney wormed her way into my family, doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. You're ridiculous. Wen. Wait, where are you going? Hey, we have to talk about tomorrow. What's to talk about? Okay, we can't play, so we're out. You know maybe, maybe this is a sign. Maybe it's time to call it quits. What, so you just want to give up? You just be happy that you're off the hook and that you don't have to go on stage any more. Oh, no, no! Wen, this isn't about Lemonade Mouth! This is about you not appreciating what you have! You have a family! Your dad, your sister, Sydney! I don't even remember my mom! I haven't talked to my dad in years! And you have the nerve to feel sorry for yourself? Well... Okay, no, fine! Go ahead. Give up! See if I care! I didn't even want to be in this band in the first place! Then why did you do it? For you, you jerk! I did it for you. Hey, it's me. We have an emergency. I'm right in front of the school. Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Anybody know what this is about? Where is she? What happened to your voice? There she is. What happened? Did you all get hit by a bus, or something? Look who's talking. What's going on, Stella? Yeah. What are you doing? I am protesting the removal of our Mel's Lemonade machine. You're kidding me, right? In this weather? Okay, kid. Enough playing around. I got three more pick-ups today. It's gonna rain. Let's get outta here. Are you really willing to support the rampant tyranny and oppression of the powerful over the voiceless? You move, or I move you. It's your choice, kid. I am not moving until you put our lemonade machine back! Have it your way, kid. Hey! No, no! Hey! Put her down! Hey, hey! Needless to say, that day was a bit of a low for the band. So much for Rising Star. We can't skip it. Well, we can't play. It's over. Wen's right. We'll lose. So, we lose? So what? Lemonade Mouth is bigger than a competition. We did it to be heard. For our fans. For ourselves. For our friendship. Thank you. Guys, we can't give up! Olivia, this isn't just humiliating ourselves on, like, a high-school level. Look, we're not doing it. Agreed. In case you haven't noticed, Stella, we're in a holding cell. Okay, and you're the only one to blame. Me? Yeah, you. Yeah, it's pretty much all your fault, Stella. We didn't actually get arrested! Okay, we're waiting for our parents to come pick us up. Oh, great. Our parents... Guys, can you please stop fighting? Stupid. ♪ You know I'll be there Just gotta call ♪ Still be singing Come on, come on Turn up the music ♪ It's all we got, we're gonna use it ♪ Come on, come on, turn up the music ♪ Are we in?

Wen, your dad, he's stuck in town at work. He's on his way, I just thought I'd come and... Oh! Thanks for coming. Absolutely. Okay, look, I know you're disappointed in me, and I just... I don't want to talk about it. Let's go. No, Baba, please. I need to say this. Look, I'm never gonna be this perfect Indian daughter you want me to be. I'm never gonna be just a regular American teenager. I guess I don't know what I am exactly. Maybe a little bit of both? But, uh, what I'm trying to say is, I'm finding my way. And, yeah, I'll make mistakes. But I deserve for you to just let me be me. Could you at least try, Baba? But you're still in trouble. I know. Here we go. Tommy? You're lucky I picked up the phone instead of Mom. Tell me about it. Here's the thing, Charlie. You wanna play music? You need to stand up to Mom and Dad and tell them that. Tell them soccer isn't for you. That you want to go to music school, not Stanford. It's easy for you to say. They think everything you do is perfect. Yeah, well, they're not thinkin' that for long. My grades this semester? Not so hot. So much for that whole "perfect" thing, huh? Here's an idea. What do you say we go tell Mom and Dad, together? Yeah, I know. Grounded for life. You got off with a warning. Let's just leave it at that. Do you know what I see when I look at you, Stella? I see the most determined, focused girl I've ever known. I mean, look at what you've done! You started a band. You stood up for what you believed in. I'm sorry that I've been so distracted lately. But, Stell... I couldn't be any prouder of what I see. Really? Mmm. Thanks, Mom.

Yeah, well, "perfect", Wen, way overrated. Come here. Thank you. For a long time, there's been an empty spot in my life, and in my heart. And meeting you has brought joy back into my life.

That's my band mate up there. And that's my old college buddy. See? You and me, we're, like, practically best friends already. You know, I used to be in a band, too. Really? Yeah. Played bass. What do you do now? Now I own an organic lemonade company. Thing is going gangbusters. It's crazy. People just can't get enough of the stuff. Mel? Yeah. Let me ask you something, Mel. Sometimes, risking it all to have your voice heard pays off in ways you never imagined. Mel understood this, and was more than happy to help us build a place where all our voices could be heard, outside of the basement. Congratulations, Miss Reznick. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right. Let's open up our music hall. We are officially... One second, Jenny. One second. Photo op for the papers, right here. Here we are. We are open! Who would've thought? Stella. Stella did all of this. Hey, you guys! Cheers! Cheers! Oh! To music. To music. You know, she'd actually make a very good principal one day. What? Well, I used to be a bit of a rebel myself, back in the day. Really? Yeah. Oh, Stanley. Lemonade Mouth! And that, Dad, is how Lemonade Mouth came to be. I can't wait to tell you the rest in person. I really miss you, Dad. Love, Olivia. Oh, I almost forgot, Dad. You're never gonna believe where we're playing next week. I just hope our new guitar player can keep up. ♪ Ooh, yeah!
