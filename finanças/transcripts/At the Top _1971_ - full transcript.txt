AT THE TOP Why are you crying? I'm fed up with this life. Hey, old timers, hurry up! You're too slow! And that guy who won't shut up... Come here, kid. All right, let's start. Where do we position the cameraman? Director, we're about to start. - Romeo. - Romeo. Romeo. - Ching, they're filming downstairs. - Really? Yes, and they need extras. I'm already in. - Really? - Yes. - Well? - Yes, I'll be right down. All right. Manny, tell them to put liquor bottles on the tables. Director, where do you want the camera? We'll take a full shot from there. 25 mm lens. - What number are we in, Manny? - Number... Sequence 5, Number 5. Manny, create for me an atmosphere that's-- - Quiet please! - Quiet. Make it look like people have been drinking here for a while. The ashtrays, fill them with cigarette butts. Scatter some napkins all over. Do you understand? Okay, director. Props! Where's Carmen? She's at home. She's sulking again. Why? Did you have another fight? What else. I don't think she's in this sequence anyway. That's great. Why don't we have divorce in the Philippines? - What's your name? - Carina. Move it closer to me. Director, should we put the lights here? Yes. A bit more. You know, this movie makes me really nervous. When you have such a fussy director... Too bright. Move the lights back. Extras, please. Gather round. Let's go. We might upset the director. Listen up! I want all of you to know that I want you to act natural and real. Hey, you monkey, listen up. What's funny? When this movie is released, I don't want the audience to say, "Look at those extras, they're like lamp posts. They're so stiff." When they watch this, I want them to say, "Look at those extras, they're so good, they're very natural." Do you understand? Take this off. You look like a dragonfly that's... Is Romeo made up and ready? Direk, he's ready. - You're going to disperse, okay? - Okay. Waiter, you come in later. What am I gonna do here, direk? Don't call me "direk". Didn't I tell you I get goosebumps when someone calls me "direk"? I'm sorry. Sit here. - Manny. - Director? I need a beautiful girl to sit beside Romeo. Props men, I need a chair here. When the brawl starts, I need a girl who can scream really loud, like she's hysterical, like she's losing her mind. Which one of you can do that? Me, direk. Come here. Miss, this is how the scene will go. You sit here beside Romeo. And then, the villain sees you. He goes to your table, grabs Romeo. Naturally, a brawl ensues, some fighting. And you become agitated. You start screaming. You can't get up from your seat, like you're glued to it. - Can you do that? - Yes. Where's that chair? You move like turtles. I need two more extras here. The one wearing blue and the one in yellow, come here. Come here. As for you, remember what I told you? Talk to each other. It has to be loud. You're drinking and smoking. Stop brushing your hair. You're not in a shampoo commercial. Stop that. Sit down. Okay. Quiet please. Let's rehearse. Abner, monitor the extras. Don't forget that you're drinking, Don't forget that you're drinking, talking and smoking. I need the waiter here. Waiter, you walk in with a bottle of brandy. You put it on that table. Okay? Quiet please. Action! Not like that, you morons. When the Lord showered the world with intelligence, all you people caught was stupidity! Fish brains! Again! Hey, kid, you're in this scene too. Initially, you won't be in the frame. When I give you the cue, you come in, you grab Romeo. He fights back, and you fall. Then, she screams. Then, we cut. - Okay? - All right, director. As for you, you empty headed-- Listen to me. Quiet! My voice is getting hoarse. This is unbelievable. Go off frame. Ready. Extras, don't forget that when the brawl starts, you all start screaming. You start running, tripping all over and knocking down chairs, okay? Ready. I want you to scream louder than everyone else, okay? Okay, direk. I mean, director. Okay, general rehearsal. Action! You guys are talking. Good. Miss, what's your name? - It's Ching. - Ching? You have potential. If you don't want me to, then I won't! Why are you annoying me this late? I said, if you don't want me to, I won't! I know you. When I say don't, the more you do it. What's wrong with that? Why do you want to act anyway? What will you get out of it? You're acting like a child. Don't you stare at me. You probably want to be like this forever, a taxi driver with a burlesque dancer for a mistress. You'll probably be happy watching me be a tramp in that nightclub forever. How many times did I tell you not to say that? - Are you doing it on purpose? - I'm a tramp. I'll slap you if you say it again. I'm a tramp. I told you to stop drinking. - Mom, Dad is here. - Tell him to come in. Dad! Mom's waiting in her room. - What will you say? - Thank you. All right. Go and play. I gave our son some money. We went to Luneta. I think he enjoyed it. I mended your T-shirt. You can wear it again. - Do you want some coffee? - No, thank you. I'll go ahead. - Don't forget your T-shirt. - I will get it next time. Aren't you going to--? - When will you be back? - Maybe on Sunday. We'll see. Bye. How can I not be upset? That jerk didn't come home again last night. He probably thinks he can do this to me. Once I find out who he's seeing, I'll create a big scene. Why do you bring your personal problems to the set? It's affecting our work. Is it my fault? I told that damn producer it will be hell if she puts us together. But she was insistent. What do we do now? How can you work when you're so upset? You're so tense. Well, I didn't intend to be like this. Who likes being this tense? It's just that whenever I see him, I want to strangle him. All right, calm down. This shoot has been delayed enough. Don't worry, I will talk to Romeo. Tell him his kids are looking for him. Hey, kid, can you call Romeo. I want to talk to him. Okay, director. - Hey, Ching, you're here! - Yes, I am. You're on standby, all right. We might need you later. Ching, this is Carmen. Tell him he should come over. Director, he refused. He wants you instead. You see that? The arrogance. He's always stubborn. I think he forgot that I made him. If not for me, he would still be a bum. Excuse me, Ching. Romeo, let's talk. Romeo, you and Carmen are my friends but I'm about to lose my patience. I don't like seeing the two of you fight, but, please, don't bring your marital problems to the set. You don't have to worry about me. It's her who's being troublesome. Do you know that she collects my salary? It's your fault, direk-- I mean, director. You spoil her. If I were the director, I'd put her in her place. - Push her around the set sometimes. - Okay, calm down. We can start filming now if you want. - You're up to it? - Sure, why not? Okay, we'll do a take. - You know what to do? - Yes. Carmen, let's talk about your problems some other time, okay? Let's do a take first. Look, we're really delayed. I don't want to. Until he explains where he was last week, I won't do a scene with him. I've been trying to be very patient and I'm sick and tired of this. We all have problems in life. You don't have the right to bring yours to this set and ruin my film. We're filming now whether you like it or not. Then do your scene. I'm going home. Carmen! What's wrong with her? That woman is crazy. Ching, a moment please. I'll make you Carmen's double, okay? I'll shoot you from behind. Just long shots, so no one will notice. - Is that okay? - Sure. Angge. - I think it will fit. Wear it. - It will. Angge, dress her up and put a wig on her. Come on, come on. Come here. Goodness, no need for that. I'm used to stripping in front of people. - Why? - Well, I'm a stripper. Your eyes... When it comes to peeping, you all get A's. Carmen's dress fits you like a glove. When you have your back turned in a long shot, they won't notice it's not her. Hey, why are they fighting anyway? Aren't they a love team? Oh, don't believe any of that. That's just the press release. - In reality, they don't get along. - Really? Hey, are you done? - Okay, director, she's ready. - Then come on over. Let's see. It's pretty good. Okay, this is what you'll do. This is your marker, Ching. You run here. When you get here, Romeo catches up then grabs you. Then you fight. You both fall on your knees, then I yell cut, okay? All right. - Okay, let's rehearse. - Quiet, please! Ready? Action. Ching, when you're running, even with your back turned, I want you to show the audience you're distraught, like you don't want to live anymore. Because this guy, He keeps cheating on you. You can't take it anymore. Do you understand? And you, Romeo, run faster, so you can catch up, okay? Okay, ready for take. Positions, please. Are you ready, Ching? Romeo? Okay, ready... - Rolling. - Sequence 38, Scene 1, Take 1. Action. That was a good shot. Did that tire you out? It tired me out, but I liked it. It was fun. - Fun? Why? - Because it seemed real. Can I have one? You know, when we were fighting, we weren't acting anymore, it was real. Can I go swimming? Sure, you're already done. -Thank you. - Okay. Every movie should always reflect something that's true about life, about people. If a movie doesn't reflect the truth, it shouldn't be made at all. It will just be a waste of money. It will just be a waste of time. So, Ching, I make it a point that, in my movies, the characters in my story are real people, not stereotypes. I want to see my characters filled with emotion. I don't like movies filled with, you know, singing, crying, fighting. Things that have no meaning. Come here, Ching. I will teach you something about acting. Observe how these people move. Now think of how actors move. Isn't it so unreal how actors move in a film? You look stunned. Well, because it's the first time I've heard anything like that. - Like what? - The things you just said. - About making films? - Yes. - Why would that make you sad? - Because... You see, I envy your intelligence. I suddenly realized that I didn't get that far in school. School is not that important. The important thing is to have an open mind like yours, so that if something needs to be learned, it's possible. Well? Shall we go? You jerk. How dare you poke at me, when you haven't been home for three weeks? You have the nerve to shout at me? I'll kill you. You idiot, you want me to slap you? Why would I go home? Whenever I'm home, you do nothing but shout, nag and get jealous. What do you think I am? A puppy you can keep on a leash? Don't you dare shout at me. You used to live off of me. If not for me, you would still be a bum today. Probably until the day I die, you would still be saying that, that I lived off of you. Let's get everything out in the open right here. I have nothing to be afraid of. I have a clean record. - Clean of what? - Not like him. Let go of me. - That's enough. - I'm not like you. I only married you because we're lucky at the box office. I'll rip your head off, you idiot! I only married you because you were four months pregnant! - You idiot! -That's enough. That's enough, there are reporters here. That's enough. Why are you meddling anyway? This is our fight. -That's enough. - Let me go! The producer is here. What is this? - Where's the director? Call him. - All right. The two of you, you're always fighting. I know that. Now, I don't want you bringing your marital problems to this set. It's affecting my movie. Now, I don't want to hear anything more about this fight, okay? I don't want to know. I don't care. Sir, the producer is asking for you. If you both-- If you both want to kill each other, then go kill each other. But please, do it after we wrap the movie and not now! So, did I make myself clear? All right, direk, let's get to work. Sure. - Is everything set up? - Yes, direk. - What lens did you attach here? - The 18 mm. You idiot, I said to use the 25 mm lens! - Change it! - Yes, sir. Hey, Carmen, where are you going? - I'm going home. - What? Get another actress. I have no time for this. I can't believe this woman. The more you tolerate her, the more she-- What do you mean you're going home? - Get to work. - You heard me. Don't get on my bad side, Carmen. Either you replace him or you replace me. Because both of us together? Impossible. So you're a swellhead now, huh? I think you've forgotten how you used to kneel before me just to get a bit role. I will sue you! Badong, let's go. Hey, everyone, back to work now! Come on! Come on! Hurry up! Back to work! - Hey, get me a chair, quickly. - Yes, ma'am. These actors nowadays... They're so quick to forget. They think they will always be on top. Hey, what are you doing? Staring into space? Start filming. Film what? The trees? All that's left are Carmen's scenes. I have no time for your jokes, okay? So, what now? It would be better to just replace Carmen. She's given me too many headaches. Replace her? Who will replace her? Liza? Liza isn't available. She's doing four films right now. If Liza's not available, then who? - Pinggoy, Pinggoy. - What? Pinggoy. Hey, you won't believe it. I'm an actress now. Weren't you? For a long time now? I'm not a mere extra anymore. I got a starring role. You know what? The lead actors had a fight. Carmen walked out. It was such a scene. Then the director recommended me. So now I'm an actress. What's wrong with you? Hey, I'm talking to you! You're envious, aren't you? Tell me the truth. You're envious, aren't you? Hey, Pinggoy, we've been together a long time. I know you very well. I know you're envious. Because you always want to be better. You can't accept the fact that I can do better than you. What are you talking about? Aren't you? It's true, right? Don't act up on me. You think I don't know? You're afraid I'll do better than you. Right? You want us both in the ditch. You, a taxi driver, and me, a taxi dancer. - Stop it. - Come on, admit it. You're envious and afraid, right? Didn't I tell you to stop? Your ego can't accept that I'm smarter than you, that I have other opportunities. While you-- Hey, don't hit me. I will fight back. Why are you acting like that? I won't leave you. Remember the first time we met? You came out of the club. You got into my taxi. Then I took you home. And since then, I drove you home every night. I told you I'd do anything for you. I'd leave my family if you ask. Now... - Where are you going? - I'll just go get some fresh air. I'll go with you. No need. All right, hurry up. Give me a pen and paper, hurry. Ching, this is... - What's your name? Berto. - Berto. He's our PR man. He will handle your publicity. So now, you'll sign this and be under contract with us, okay? Come on, make it quick. What are you waiting for? Romy, come on. I have a lot of things to do, come on. By the way, I came up with a screen name for you. - What is it? - Ready. Paloma Miranda. Hey, by the way, don't forget her screen name, okay? - Paloma Miranda. - All right. Romy, one more. Okay. This movie... I've shelled out so much for it. I've shelled out 80,000, and, up to now, it's still not finished. And that director? I'm telling you, the way he handles a movie... You won't believe it, but according to his assistant director, sometimes, for just one shot, he does eight takes. Doesn't he know by now? Raw shots are now being sold in the black market. All right, you take care of this. Tell the reporters to come here right away. Benigno, bring out the Mercedes! Hurry up! You know, Ching, I have to coach you on what to say to those movie scribes. Wait, Roberto. What does "coach" mean? It means I will teach you how to respond to their questions. For example, "How were you discovered?" Well, I was a stripper. - And then-- - See? That's what I mean. Don't tell them you were a stripper. Instead say this. Just say... I was on vacation in Manila. And my friends and I thought it was fun to watch Romeo and Carmen shoot their films. So we would watch them. Then, one day, the director noticed me. He asked me, "Do you want to be an actress?" I said, "No, I don't." Because, you know, I wasn't sure if I was qualified. He persuaded me. Even the producers persuaded me. They even went to my father to ask for permission, permission from my father. Initially, he was upset about it. - What school are you from? - Far Eastern University. What do you think of sex on the screen? Will you consent to doing a nude scene? I think sex... No, it should be... As long as there's a reason for the sex scene, right? If there's no reason for putting in the sex scene, then the actress shouldn't do it. Me, I'll just go naked on screen if the story calls for it. After all, I am an actress. If you have the body, then you must flaunt it, right? I am for greater realism in our pictures. Do you think Filipino films are progressing? Oh, yes. The audience nowadays are intelligent. And our movies are improving. What do you think about Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos? I think they're very nice. But I'm not like them. I want to be a dramatic actress. Are you... married? Of course not. You see, I haven't met my... What do you call it? The man in my life. - Where are you going? - I'm going home. - Going home? Where? - To my wife. To that woman? Are you crazy? You're going home to her? You don't even talk to her. My son is with her. What kind of life will you have? What will you do? That's my problem. - You can't leave. - I'll hit you with this. Go ahead and try. Taxi driver! Taxi driver! Do you want to know why I'm leaving you? Because you always remind me that I'm just a taxi driver. So before you become a big star, it's best that we break up, because I might end up breaking your face. But don't you forget. I know where you came from. Berto, I need your help. Pinggoy left last night. He went back to his wife. What do you mean stay out of it? He doesn't love that woman. They don't even talk. He only went home, because we had a fight. What? Well, tough. Tell them I won't be on the set until I've talked to Pinggoy. I won't. So are you coming here or not? Fine. I will be right over. Let's go. I'll take you to school. Wait, I will get you a fresh shirt. This is fine. - Hey, are you Pinggoy? - Yes. Why? Ching wants to talk to you. She's in her car. Tell her to come here. Pinggoy, Berto can help you become an actor. Didn't I say I'm not interested? Why? How much do you earn by driving a taxi? Go on, we might end up fighting again. Goodbye. Pinggoy! I know why he doesn't want to be an actor. It's kind of a blow to his ego. And he doesn't want to be indebted to me. Maybe he thinks I'll use it against him some day. You know, I really love Pinggoy. We always fight, and, sometimes, I know I give him a hard time. But that's normal, right? You know, he used to take my money when I was still a stripper. He wasn't ashamed to take it, because, maybe for him, we were in the same boat. But now that I'm an actress, he treats me differently. Then maybe it's better that you did break up. Our producer is looking for an actor to play opposite you, your love team partner. I can't do anything about it. I really love Pinggoy. You know, the reason I want him to stop being a taxi driver and become an actor so we can be in the same stature. I know he'll come back once we're on the same level. Ching, come here. Look at these two shots. In film editing, what I'm doing right now, it's easy to manipulate things, it's easy to change the story. Like this close up shot of you, look at it. If I cut this and splice in a close up shot of this actor, it will seem like you're sad. But if I splice in this shot of Pinggoy, it will seem like you're happy. - Do you understand what I'm saying? - No. What I'm saying is it's easy to manipulate film. It's easy to connect people. For example, you and Pinggoy... I can break you apart, and splice you in with another man. I don't know what that has to do with me and Pinggoy. Never mind. It's really hard to explain. Pinggoy, it's Totoy... - What happened? - He's burning up with fever. The doctor just left. He prescribed some medicine. He's in no danger, but he needs those right away or else his lungs will be affected. - What's the matter? - I don't have the money. I wasn't able to drive. There's a jeepney strike. They would throw rocks at taxis. Maybe you can borrow from your friends across the street. Have you seen Carding? Haven't you heard? He's in the hospital. - Why? - He was hit by protesters. His head got hit. Buddy. - Were you able to drive today? - No, it's a mess in Manila. My son is sick and I'm broke. Can you lend me some? I only have three pesos here. All right. Did you get some money? All because... - Because of what? - Nothing. - Say what you wanted to say. - It's nothing. Say it. Because of what? Keep it down. You'll wake him up. - Say it. -That's enough. Say what you wanted to say. That's enough. - Say it. - I said enough. You want me to break this? Because you don't want to look for another job. That's not what you wanted to say. You regret marrying a lowly taxi driver, a well-educated woman like you. - I never said that. - But you always think of it. I can read all your moves. You may not say it, but you always imply that you're smarter than me. - Pinggoy, please. - "Pinggoy, please." Pinggoy, what are you complaining about? No matter what you do, you hear nothing from me, even when you don't come home for a week, even when you're with another woman. How can I live in this house when you keep playing the martyr? Are you making a profession out of it? You're being too kind. You're being too patient. You care too much about me. It's all too much. Why? - Pinggoy, stop it. - No, you stop. Because by playing the martyr and the suffering wife, you're implying that I'm a worthless man. You might not say it, but every move you make hurts me. Hello? Pinggoy? Pinggoy who? Oh, Paloma's boyfriend. I mean, Ching. She's dubbing at the studio. Pay up. What is it? Totoy has a high-grade fever. The doctor said it might affect his lungs. I wasn't able to take out the cab because of the strike. So I don't have money to buy medicine. - And-- - Hold on. - Here's a 50. - That's too much. Twenty will do. - Take it. You might need it. - Twenty is fine. You need to pay the doctor too. Just take it. All right then, thank you. I'll pay you back. - What? - Why? Are you insulting me? Why would you pay me back? - You're raising your voice again. - And why shouldn't k? You're like a... Why pay me back? Am I a stranger? Where did you get the money? From a friend. Adult films are making a lot of money now. One film can make 20,000 a day. Hey, do you know of any producers in need of titles? - That's my business now. - Really? - What titles do you have? - I've got plenty. Legs Spread Out on the Farm, Carnal Greed, Hooked on Holes. Hello. Oh, hey, Pinggoy. I need a job. The strike isn't over yet. - I'll take any job. - A job? Hold on. Tommy, do you know of any job openings? - Who's on the line? - It's Pinggoy, Ching's boyfriend. But I think they broke up. - Is he ugly like a crab? - No, he can pass for an actor. He wasn't interested in being one, but I think he changed his mind. All right, ask him to come over. He might want a part in Legs Spread Out on the Farm. - All right, direk. - Ready? - Camera, ready? - Okay, ready. - Stand by. - Ready? Hurry up, everyone! Goodness, what's taking you so long? All right, ready for a take, okay? Camera, you might miss filming this again! We're ready! If he jumps and gets wet, everything will be ruined. Okay, ready! - Monitor! - Rolling. Action! Nice one. I have good news for you, come here. Hold on. Can't you see I'm busy? Double time! We're running on a tight schedule! - Okay, ready? - What now, direk? When I say "action", you need to jump, okay? - Okay! - All right! - Wait a minute! - What? - Fix the foam, please! - Will you fix that thing? And where's my coffee? Or even my water, my goodness! Fix that, he might hit the railing! Move the camera here! Okay, we're ready, direk. We're all set. Okay, action! That's it, good take! Let's move on to the next scene. Hang on, direk. What took you so long to jump? All right, let's move on. We're in a rush here. I know this producer looking for new actors. He made me his PR man. He's new and rich. He's from Negros. I told him I'd get him some actors. Who do you have in mind? You. Who else? Me? What do I know about acting? I might get nervous and all. Idiot. Anyone can become an actor. You can even bring your grandfather here and I'll make him an actor. Do you plan to be like this for the rest of your life? A stuntman? Surely, you have to graduate from doing this. Look at Jun Aristorenas. He's a producer now. Besides, why worry about acting? It's just an adult film. You know what? Hang on, what's your name again? Pinggoy. You know, some people say I should hire Tito Galla or Lito Legaspi. But it's difficult, you see, because their fees are too high. I'm actually new to the industry. So, naturally, I want to work with beginners too. Like you, for instance. Now, let's say this movie is a hit. Then we succeed together, right? Am I right? What I'm trying to say is this. You see, I don't plan to invest too much money on this film. It's not that I don't have the money, but you know how it is. I still don't know my way around this business. I don't want to shell out too much. That's why I can only pay you after we're done filming, and once the money from the box office starts coming in. That's how things work nowadays, right? Yes, that's how it is now. Who will I be paired with? We already hired someone. It's... Her name us... What was her name again, Tommy? - It's Jennifer, sir. - Oh, right. Jennifer. I think she's a prostitute. I don't know what nightclub she's from. So what, Pinggoy? Are you in? Say yes so we can start shooting the day after tomorrow. Don't worry about money. I got you. Come on, the producer's calling us. Take that off. Take this off. - Can't I wear this? - You want me to hit you? Stop being coy. I told the producer you're baring it all. Are you trying to humiliate me? Take your clothes off. Hey, what's happening? How come nothing's happening? Nestor, what's wrong? I don't know. That bitch Jennifer, she's still inside. She hasn't come out? You, come here. Call Jennifer. Tell her we've been waiting for ages. Hurry up! Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. What the hell's wrong with you? It's your first shooting day and you're acting up? - Ma'am? - But... What do you mean "but"? Ma'am? - What is it? - The director's asking for her. - Tell him we're on our way. - Okay. Sir, has Pinggoy arrived yet? How's everything going? We haven't started filming yet, because that idiot Jennifer won't take her clothes off. Wait, let me go get her myself. Ma'am? Ma'am! - Ma'am! - What is it? Oh, sir. She's coming out now. - Hurry up, okay? - Yes, sir. The minute Jennifer comes out, start filming, you hear? You wretched child, take that off. Of all the days to act like Tita Duran... I'll slap you in front of them if you don't follow me. - Mom, please. - Shut up and take those off. Come on, let's go. Direk, she's ready. - Why are her eyes red? - Oh, that's just how they are. - Okay, hurry up. - Go on now. Go. - Move and lie down. - Okay, ready. I have another shoot to go to. Direk, slap her if she resists. All right. Leave her to us. Jennifer, here's what I want. I want it larger-than-life. I want to hear heavy breathing like this: Do something like this: After that, just get into it all. Okay, wipe off her tears. All right, we're ready for a take now. Hurry up. ls everything ready? All right, that's enough. Lie down now. Now the towels... Pinggoy, take the towel off. Jennifer, take off the towel, quickly. All right, the camera's here. Come on. Ready. All right, ready for a take? Hurry up. Everything ready? - Okay, motor... - Rolling. Action. What kind of press conference is this? There's no food. Hey, how can I buy food when I had to shell out 200,000 because of his stupid wife? Where did you find your new actor? I hear she used to be a stripteaser. A stripteaser. I really liked it even if I didn't understand it. The problem with this director is he's too fussy. French style, Italian style, Japanese style... - People don't get that. - It's too complicated. Well, it's an art film but it has no commercial value. - It won't click with an audience. - People won't understand it. Be charming when dealing with those movie scribes, okay? Smile at them. That's it. It's the same old story every time we make a film. That's the way things go. You know what, Romeo? I think your film will flop. And you don't have Carmen with you. Is it true that Carmen's in the States? Yes. But off the record, what made you say the movie will flop? I was just kidding. Oh, my goodness. It was bad, wasn't it? But-- - No, it wasn't. - It was actually good. Just help me, okay? I had a lot of problems with this film. - My lead actress walked out and-- - You need a premiere. - What? - A premiere to attract people. I don't even-- Just help me, okay? - Don't worry, we will help you. - Leave it to us. Nestor Torre, wait up! - What do you think? - Ching. Ching, I want you to meet my wife, Maria Teresa. - Hello. How do you do? So, Ruben, I'll go ahead. It's just too warm in here. Good night, darling. Did you hear what the people said? I did. We still have a week before the movie screens. You still have time to tweak the film and change some scenes. Why should I change it? I don't see anything wrong with it. I thought you heard what those movie scribes said? You hired me as your director, and that's the movie I gave you. If you didn't like it, I can't do anything about that. I told you before we even started, that I can't make movies filled with just drama or sex scenes. But I also told you, you shouldn't forget about our audience right now. Look at the movie you made. The scenes are so fast-paced. And your editing style? Even I can't understand it. And what kind of ending did you give it? What kind of foolishness was that? Instead of facing each other, the leads had their backs to each other. Well, you should have read the script before we even started. And now you're panicking like some fool. Ruben, film-making is a business before anything else. Don't tell me that. I will go crazy. Don't you turn your back on me. You're being rude. People like you will ruin the film industry. You don't know what your audience wants. You don't understand how they feel. It's you who can't understand them. I'm tired of producers who keep saying that country folk will never appreciate an intelligent film. That's because, to you, all that matters is money. Do you think you can make a movie without my money? Do you know how much your movie cost me? Do you know how much money you spent? And how much do you think will I earn from that stupid movie? Twenty-five percent will go to distributors. Twenty-five percent will go to exhibitors. Twenty-seven percent will go to the government. Then there's the municipal tax, entertainment tax and all the other taxes. For every peso earned by that film, I get only 25 cents. And my checkers rip me off too. Then you give me such a movie? No comedy, no songs, no sexy scenes. If you want a two-bit movie, then look for another director. Berto, the movie's a dismal flop. That's what the movie scribes are telling me. No, by three o'clock, less than 400 was made at the box office. Berto, I need your help. You know, even though this is a flop, I still want an acting career. Berto, how much will you charge me if I hire you as my personal PR man? Three hundred? Okay. That's for one month. Okay. Can you create a huge publicity campaign for me? Yes, that will be easy. I handle several comic magazines. You know, I want a change of image. Yes, so send photographers over. I want to be a sex symbol. That's marketable today, right? By the way, Berto, how did Pinggoy's movie turn out? I hear that his handler's a homo. It's a box office hit. People flocked to the movie houses because of all the steamy scenes. Well, that's the only thing he's good at. All right, Berto. Contact those photographers as soon as you can. Okay. Bye. Ready, Paloma? I heard someone bought the comic novel At The Top... Who is producing it? That's Pinggoy's producer, right? Well, I want to meet with them. You know, I read this novel. And the role of Carla suits me. Yes, so get me an appointment with that producer. Carla's role in At The Top... suits me. I understand her well, because I'm just like her. My fee won't be an issue. I leave that up to you. It won't be a problem. What's important is that I make another film now. I'm sure you heard about how big a flop my movie was. If you hire me, you won't regret it. I can take my clothes off. Just give me this break. And with Paloma, you surely will save money. - She can do anything in one take. - All right. Let's give it a try. I thought I wouldn't get to say anything. Why do you talk so fast anyway? Life is short. We shouldn't waste any time. Who will be Paloma's leading man? It's... Who's that actor again? The media is raving about his film right now. - It's... - Who is it? It's... What's his name again? It's Pinggoy. Right, Pinggoy Morales. Pinggoy? Is Pinggoy here already? He's not yet here, direk. He's still at home. My goodness, what kind of actor did you get? He's very unprofessional. On a shooting day, he's not here. Direk, Pinggoy's here. Really? All right. Let's get to work. Tell him that he's two hours late. - I'm sorry I'm late, direk. - Okay. I was a guest on Oras ng Ligaya. - What should I do, direk? - What? Well, take off your clothes. - Ching, you're here. - I've been here for hours. No, it's okay. I still have makeup on. I came from a TV shoot. - Direk, what's the sequence number? - What? ??? Hey, where's my script? It's not here, direk. - Hey. - Yes? - Where's my script? - It was just here. This movie is about to screen, and you guys are still lazing around. Come on. Oh, it's here. All right. Let's start. Listen, it's sequence... It's Sequence 19-- Twelve, Scene 4. Okay? Get ready. Ching, come here. Let's start. Pinggoy, lay down on the bed. Hurry up. Go on, be quick and lie down. This movie screens soon. - Direk, should I lie down here? - Well, yes, of course. Wait, no, not yet. Sit down. I'll tell you what to do in a bit. Just stay put. From now on, there will be no more rehearsals. We'll be filming right away, okay? Just stay there, and you, Ching... There, that's it. After that, Pinggoy, you will say... I got it. This is what you will say... "What are you doing here?" And you, Ching, this is what you will say. "Roberto, don't humiliate me. I need your help. I need you to quench my carnal desires." - That's it. - Direk, hold on. - Why is the camera positioned that way? - Why? My lines are very long. Why is my back turned to the camera? The camera should face me. Why are you telling me how to do my job? But my lines are important, right? - Ching, will you cool it? - Don't interfere. How will people see my carnal desire if my back is turned to the camera? If you're really a good actress, you'll connect with your audience no matter where you're facing. That's nonsense. Ching, he's our director. Why are you telling him what to do? That's enough. I don't have time for this argument. No, this is not right. Ask anyone here. - Is there--? - Why are you so arrogant? I'm not arrogant, I just want to get this right. You're just jealous, because I'll be facing the camera. Don't you talk to me that way, you idiot. k just want everything right. - I thought you changed, but-- - Why should I change? Did you change? Why should you get one over me? That's enough. You're just acting up because your movie was a flop. You lecherous jerk! What kind of a man are you? You think I don't know who's backing you? It's that gay handler of yours. - Stop it. - Let me go! What now, direk? - Pinggoy, where are you going? - Imbeciles! Hello, lnterContinental? Is the conference about to start? Fine, I'll be there in ten minutes. Thank you. Maria? I would like to... May I talk to Ruben, please? - Have a seat. - Thank you. - Maria. - Yes, ma'am? Come here. Tell Ruben that he has a guest. - Yes, ma'am. - Make it quick. Excuse me. I'm sure the producer will agree to replace that stupid director. Would you believe they gave me a legman for a director? You should take his place. I'm done with that kind of life, Ching. Oh, my goodness. My movie will surely flop again. Ruben, help me with my stupid producer. I'm sure he'll agree to a change of director if you're the replacement. Just make it less artistic than our previous film. Ching, you're just wasting your time. I'm not interested in making adult films. God. What's the deal with documentary films? In documentary films, like this one, I will be stating facts and not lies. Nonsense! You can still make a film that people will love, that viewers will understand, that is truthful and tastefully done. Just make sure it's not too fast-paced, and put in a touch of comedy as well. Don't make it like the other films you do which are too-- - Ching, you don't understand me. - I really don't. I'm giving you another chance to become a "direk". Stop calling me "direk!" Don't you know that I left Filipino movies because I get goosebumps every time they call me "direk"? That's Filipino movies for you. They're all about shortcuts. We need to work together. Let's replace that director. I'm sure if we both go to the producer and tell him we want to change directors, he will agree. What for? You're just going to ruin everything. That's scheming. Hey, Tommy, don't butt in. And why not? This is my house, and I'm Pinggoy's PR man. Pinggoy, come on. Do you want to be a porn star your whole life? Don't you have dreams? So what? The film's making money. Yes, but there are adult films that have artistic integrity. Unlike this director who has none. As long as I get paid, why should I complain? You know, Pinggoy, I wanted us to become actors for a long time. And now my dream has come true. I want us to become a love team. I'm sure we'll be popular with the fans, because we're both sex symbols. But for that to happen, our first movie should be well-made. He said he doesn't want to. Why are you forcing him? Are you gonna stay that way the rest of your life? Lethargic? - Swallowing everything life gives you? - This is my house. - Don't make a scene. - Stay out of this! Ching, you're crossing the line. When are you going to change? You're not just stupid, you're stubborn as well. You're such a bitch! I'm not afraid of you. - Ching, I think it would be better if-- - Who do you think you are? Queer. Paloma Miranda. Superstar. Hello, hello, hello, publicity man. Berto. Is it difficult to retouch my pictures? Are the lines on my face that evident? But then... That's how movies are. It's all about retouching. It's all about deception. This wall, do people know it's just paint? - You have a call slip for tomorrow. - Work again. - Ching, stop, it will affect your work. - Hey, Berto. - Stop meddling with me. - You're always drunk. - So what? - You've been getting into fights. You see, they're all fools. Leave me alone. - They're badmouthing you. - So what? They're telling other producers you're hard to work with. - So? - Remember what I told you before? The most important thing an actor needs is not talent, but PR. - Like Pinggoy. - Oh, Pinggoy? Pinggoy Morales. Do you know the history of Paloma Miranda and Pinggoy Morales? No? Then, Berto, listen and I will tell you. You see, in the past, Paloma Miranda was a taxi dancer, while Pinggoy Morales was a taxi driver. Amusing, isn't it? Well, even though Paloma Miranda was just a dancer... Oh, her name was Ching then. ...and Pinggoy Morales was just a taxi driver, they were a love team. They would fight from time to time, but they loved each other. Well, as time went on, their lives changed. Paloma Miranda, the former taxi dancer, is now an actress. And Pinggoy Morales, the former taxi driver, became an actor too. And, of course, now that they're both movie stars, many were expecting them to become a love team to make their fans happy, right? But that didn't happen. The end. I was orphaned as a child. I raised myself. I took care of myself. As long as I live, nobody will take care of me but myself. Okay, ready. Rehearsal, ready. Okay, ready. Rehearsal, ready. Action. - What is it? - I forgot my lines. "Roberto, enough. I hate myself. I don't know why I'm doing this." No wonder I forgot. They're such stupid lines. - Okay, from the start. - Okay, fine. You might say I'm hard to work with again, okay. "Roberto, enough. I hate myself." "I don't know why I'm doing this." - Okay, let's do it. - Ready. Wait a minute. Pinggoy! Pinggoy! You jerk, what did you do to me? You scumbag, what did you do? - What did you--? - Ching... What do you want to happen, huh? How could you? - Your friend is gay! - That's enough. That was supposed to be between us! How dare you? That's enough! - What do you want to happen? - What's that about? It's your friend, Tommy, I caught some gossip earlier. What about? He threatened to expose Ching's secrets. He will mention in his column she used to be a stripper, a prostitute. Leave it to me. I'll talk to Tommy. Tell Ching not to worry. Go. What's this I heard about you exposing Ching's secrets? - So what? - What do you mean "so what"? Don't you know that will ruin her? - Well, she called me a-- - A what? - You know what. - Whatever! Ching is a public figure. Don't you understand that? And you're not. I'm sick of actresses acting like they're virgins. - When the truth is-- - The truth? I'll tell you what's true. If we expose the truth, it will be known all over the Philippines. I'm a reporter, it's my job to-- Don't give me that dialogue. I know you. What do you want? Money? How much? Don't turn your back on me. I'm talking to you. Well? What do you think? And why not? I never asked you for a favor. What do you say? You're being difficult. Okay. I talked to Tommy's publisher. He refused. He doesn't even want money. He doesn't care what his reporters write, as long as they're not sued for libel. I'm sorry, Ching, I tried my best. Ching, you're drinking too much. - Pinggoy, help me. - I will. - Talk to Tommy. - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. He can't do this to me, I will kill him. I know. That's enough. I said I'll take care of it. Now go home and rest. I will talk to Tommy. Drink this so you can sleep. Tommy, I'm not kidding. If you publish your exposé about Ching, I will ruin you in my column as well. - I'm not afraid of you. - I will tell the truth about you. - Like what? - You think I don't know that every actor you build up, you also sleep with. Who will believe you? Aside from you, the actors will be ruined too. Then I'll sue you for libel. You have no proof. I have photos of Ching when she was still a burlesque dancer. Tommy's playing hardball. What does he really want anyway? A show. Ever since I became an actor, a load of problems came into my life. And now, I'm going to be involved in a scandal. Ching too. It was better back then. Life was hard, but... - Berto. - Yes? You love Ching, don't you? I do. But you never told her. No, I haven't. Why? Because I know that you're the one she loves. I'll give Tommy a call. Hello, Mr. Perez. The Paloma Miranda article for tomorrow, let's forgo that. I'll give you a different one tomorrow. Okay. Thank you. Hello. Yes, Ruben? Of course, I'm all right. Don't worry. No, I'm not drinking. Why would I drink? What? Of course, I'll attend the premiere. Why wouldn't k? What? Okay, don't worry. Bye-bye. - Hello, Ching? - Who's that, Dad? She's my leading lady. How do I feel? I'm feeling good. How else should I feel? Ching, I will pick you up within the hour. - Are you up to it? - Of course. Why do you ask? Okay, pick me up. Okay. Okay, go on. I need to get ready. - Norma, where are my pants? - It's here. Hello? Pinggoy, it's for you. Hello. Yes, Tommy. - What's up? - Nothing. I just want to know what time you'll be at the premiere. By the way, I rented a car for you. Around 9:00. Yes, I have to pick Ching up. - Ching? - I need to. For the fans. We're a love team, remember? I have to go. I'll be there on time. Why do we have to go to the premiere? It's not your movie. Ching is my friend. I'm doing this for her. If you don't want to go, it's fine. Rumors might spread about us that we've split up again if I don't. Hello. Berto? Oh, my goodness! Why do people keep calling me? Everybody is calling me. You just want to know if I'm drunk. Well, I'm not drunk. Yes, I will be at the premiere. Don't worry. And stop calling me. I might go insane, goddamn it! Pinggoy is here. Tell him I will be down in a minute. AT THE TOP...
