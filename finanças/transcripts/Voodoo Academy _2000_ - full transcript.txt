(spooky music) (thunder) (crickets, more thunder) (spooky piano music) (thunder) (ominous chord) (creepy music) (more thunder and spooky sounds) -What are you doing to her? (squeeking leather, thunder) (thunder) (organ music) -What is it? What are you doing? (thunder, creepy music) -What are you doing? -What are you doing? (creepy music building tension) (blood bubbling sounds) -Utter failure -He wasn't pure -You were impatient with the channeling Process. We can't just attempt to change him without the proper preparation -I know what I'm doing. -Apparently not, madam. -Watch the tone, Hollice. Its not a good idea to forget who you're working for -My apologies -However. You're correct my impatience was my own undoing They have to be pure in order for the ritual to work Otherwise, this is what happens Now we only have five of them left -He can be replaced I'll but the ads in the paper tomorrow Though I don't know if we can have anyone ready for the ritual by the end of the week -We will. Just be more careful next time they must be innocent, pure of mind, pure of body remember that -And you're sure you can have him prepared by the time the solstice comes next Sunday night? -Have some faith, Hollice. -What do we do about him? -You know the drill destroy him -You're the boss (creepy music) (Church Bells) (depressing music) (sounds of water) (creepy music) -Come in! -Thank you. -Christopher Sawyer, I presume. I'm Mrs Boviea, Chief administrator of the Carmical Bible College, I apologize for the lack of help out in the front office but we're still getting organized. -Thats fine, thanks. -Please take a seat, and I'm almost done reviewing your application -Okay. -Would you like a cup of tea while you wait? -No, thank you. I'm fine. -You look a little Nervous Mr. Sawyer. -No! I'm fine, really. -First time? -Excuse me? -Is this your first time being interviewed by a College? -Uh, yes. -Well, as we both know, Mr. Sawyer, this is not your standard College and this won't be your standard College interview The Carmical Bible College is an experimental facility and we're still trying to work out the kinks, so to speak. So please bear with me. -Well, I really admire Reverand Carmicals work his writings, I mean. You know I had the option to go into conventional ministry or priesthood, -Yes, I know, you have a very impressive application Mr. Sawyer. We get a lot of young men who seem to think that this place is an easy way to get a conventional college education It isn't. What we look for is someone who is serious enough about theology to benifit from our unique study program I see here, you spent a few years as a student Sunday School teacher, as well as being active in extra curricular bible studies and maintaining an above average GPA in your secular studies, very impressive I'm sure that you had your pick of conventional colleges to choose from after high school. -Well -So why come to us? Aside from the good Reverend's teachings of course? -Well, I wasn't so sure I wanted to go into the typical religious education this is a lot more exciting to me a lot of Reverend Carmicals stuff involves hard science and religious education I really believe in it, you know it really makes sense to me. And I like the idea of the small and personalized curriculum but... -Did you have a question? -Well if you don't mind me asking ma'am -Ask away. -Where is everyone? I mean, when I came in I thought I'd see a hundred students or something, but I didn't see anyone. -Actually, we only have five students enrolled at the present time. Until two days ago we had a full roster of six unfortunately we had a student who was unhappy with the curriculum and decided to leave. Thats why we're hoping to enroll a new student this week -But...why only five or six students? -Like I said, this is an experimental facility we haven't even officially registered as an educational institution yet should our program work out in the first year, we plan on expanding into a fully fledged college, but Reverend Carmical and myself feel its best to keep the first group of students somewhat small Is that a problem? -No, no actually, its kinda nice, you know, I feel that I will get more personal attention that way -Like what you see so far? -Huh? -The facility. Does it seem like a worthwhile investment of your time so far -Oh, yes. Very much so. -Excellent because if there are no further questions I think its fair to say that you have more than passed the admissions board -The admissions board? -That would be me and that means you're in Mr. Sawyer. Welcome to the Carmical Bible College. Now if you'll just follow me, I'll give you a tour of the facility. And introduce you to the fellow students you'll be working and studying with. Its study hour right now, so they should be in their dorm rooms (piano music) -This is the dining room where you'll be taking your meals Next year when we open the college to full capacity we intend to hire a chef but for now, I prepare all the meals personally. -You do all the cooking? -does that surprise you, Mr. Sawyer? -No, ma'am, no. I just thought that someone in your position wouldn't want to do all that -Absolutely! Its very important to me that my boys get their proper nutrition -Yeah but isn't that a lot of work? -Before I inherited this property from my late husband I was a restauranteur I don't mind doing a little cooking. In fact I enjoy it. -Wow I am so sorry about your husband -Don't be. he lead a very full and active life he was a scientist, did a lot of research on ancient religions Ten years ago he became a stock holder in Michal College down the road and and refurbished this old dorm building He was going to turn it into a lab -You mean Professor Miles Boviea. One of the guys who helped discover the ingredients to the fake zombie powder down in Haiti? -One and the same. He'd be pleased to know someone remembered his work as it turned out, his research on the zombie powder uncovered new and better anesthetic chemicals and psychotherapy drugs that pushed the pharmaceutical sciences ten years into the future. He was a very rich and successful man -What happened I mean, if you don't mind me asking... -Unfortunately, soon after he purchased this building, he became very ill and after he died I was faced with the choice of either selling it off or paying taxes on an otherwise worthless property Fortunately, Reverend Carmical came along and had the forsight to turn this facility into a worthwhile investment that I know my husband would be proud of -So you're a devout member of Reverend Carmical's religion? -Of course I am, as I am sure many many others soon will be. Its the religion for the new millenium -When will I get to meet Reverend Carmical? -Soon enough He usually tries to keep his distance from his students outside of the classroom Normally you would first get to meet him when you have your first class with him Now, if you'll follow me, I'll show you where you'll be sleeping and spending most of your free time and hopefully introduce you to your new housemates (church bell) -Hello, boys. Working hard? -Yeah, everybody accept Billy. He's in the internet -Hey! -I hope you're persuing the religious websites, Mr. Parker -Uh, sure Mrs B -Thats Mrs. Boviea, Billy. -Right, Mrs. Boviea. -The Sci-Fi academy chat room hardly qualifies as religious studies, Mr. Parker. I trust that you and Reverend Carmical will have plenty to discuss in your next one on one discipline meeting in the meantime, please use your study time to brush up on your theological text. -Yes Mrs. Boviea. -Well, everyone, this is Christopher Sawyer, I've just had the extreme pleasure of accepting his application to our school, which means, he'll be your new dormmate. and this is Billy Parker, whom you've already seen in action. -Hey, Christopher! Better run while you still can! -Very funny, Mr. Parker. Its a shame we're not grading you on your wit. -Oh! Why cause I'd get an easy 4.0? -I think you're grading yourself a little high. Mr. Parker is somewhat the class clown of the group thankfully, he's a little more serious about his studies. And this is Rusty Sankovitch, he had a full scholarship to central university but chose to pursue his education with us I think we're very lucky to have him. -Whats up Christopher? -Hi. -And this is Mike McCreedy, a former Catholic school honor student. -How are you? -Hello. -You and Mike would have a lot in common He too was dis-satisfied with Catholicism and came to us for a more challenging education -Sam? Sam! -Its a Chris Veraqous movie, I swear! -Its alright, Mr. Velara. I just wanted to introduce you to your new classmate, Sam Velera, meet Christopher Sawyer. Mr. Velara was an aspiring rock musician. With any luck, we should be able to afford a music department within the next couple years -I hope so, the only person I can jam with now is Billy and he sings like a horse. -Hay! -Boys! Last but not least, we have Paul Saint Claire During Highschool, Mr. Saint Claire had something of a problem interacting with others, however, we've been able to provide him with an excellent learning environment here at the Carmical Bible College -Hi -Nice to meet you -Well, now that we've gotten the introductions out of the way I'll leave you to get settled in and get aquatinted with your new schoolmates Ah, Reverend Carmical's next class starts in a half an hour, and you'll get to meet him there Any questions before I leave you to the wolves? -No, I should be fine, and, thank you so much, Mrs Boviea for everything. -My pleasure Christopher, and welcome abord -WELCOME ABORD CHRISTOPHER -Very funny, guys -Just giving you a little bit of a hard time there, Crisco -Thats Christopher -Hey, I'm just trying to get under your skin, Cocheeze -Just ignore Billy see, Billy is mind over matter. We don't mind and Billy doesn't matter -Oh, you love me, Rusty! Admit it! -Billy's good for breaking up the monotony around here. -This place is pretty boring. -Well, We're boring -I'll second that motion -We don't drink, don't smoke, and don't do drugs -And despite what Billy wants you to Think, he doesn't even download pornography off the internet. -Sad but true We're all Pat Boone clones around here total Mousecateers -You look like you're gonna fit right in -Seriously things are that straight laced around here? -Its part of the screening process They wanna make sure everyone is 100% behind their beliefs. Thats why I decided to come here. -Me too -So what is the Reverend Carmical like? -Guess you're about to find out for yourself (creepy music) (church bell) -So where are the classrooms? -This IS the classroom -Well, I thought they would have a couple regular classes to go along with our religious studies -Its bible school they're likely to make us sleepy -Hello, men I trust you spent your study time wisely -Yes sir -I also trust you have done your best to welcome our new arrival Mr. Sawyer. What about it, Son? They treating you okay? -Yes, Sir! -Thats what we like to hear Mr. Sawyer here is an above average student of religion, as you all are I hope that you will continue to show him the same respect that you show eachother we've increased our admission standards since Mr. Godfry saw fit to leave our fine establishment last week I can assure you all that Mr. Sawyer here is truly the cream of the crop Of course I should probably get around to introducing myself I'm Reverend Holice Carmical, founder of the Neurocystic Christianity Church as well as this facility for alternative bible studies. -I'm a huge advocate of your work Reverend. -Good, then we know where we all stand. As I'm sure you know, the Neurocysitc Church has gained quite a following on the coast, and that's allowed me to open up this facility. I have a practical education as a teacher, and I try to mix that with a more traditional method of spreading the word of God. You and your class mates have been chosen from hundreds of submissions you have the unique opportunity of helping augment my religion with a facility that will help build the religious leaders of tomorrow Ask my boys here they'll tell you I'm tough but fair you have to be tough to support your beliefs in this day and age My work has been questioned by everyone from the Catholic church to the United States Senate. I can tell you, not one of these authority figures has been able to shut down my church disgrace my work or find fault with my personal history this is not a scam I practice what I preach And what is it that we preach, Mr McCreedy? -Man is the creation of God and science is also the creation of God -Exactly. Neurocystic Christianity is the belief that the more advanced mankind's technology becomes, the closer to God man kind becomes. We use the hard sciences, as well as psychology and traditional Christianity to commune with the lord and help bring ourselves closer to Him why, I can show you cases we have on file of certain members of our congregation who have overcome debilitating illness drug habits, physical and psychological abnormalities and these aren't frauds perpetrated by some tent show revivalist but hard, cold technological facts what we will learn here is a great deal more than how Jesus turned water to wine or what chapter or verse of the bible details the fall of the Pharos here you will learn a new way of life. A new and better way of thinking and when you leave here, I promise you will be more empowered than most men Now that we have six of you a full roster of young men for our first curriculum I'll begin to employ my methods in earnest. What you see here is the Neurocystic Church's version of the confessional. An enclosed purely technological environment that will allow you to purify yourself by purging your sins. -To who, Reverend? -To me, Mr Sankovich Once a day, every day I'll have one of you enter the booth during class and confess your sins to me we will continue to do this until you have been cleansed of fault, and can be purely objective about your future actions. -like Catholicism? -Not quite. In the Catholic religion, confessional only relieves the burden of sin, it doesn't resolve it in Neurocysem, the process of confessional irradicates the sin teaches you not to sin again -Dear Diary, I never thought this could happen to me! -Any questions so far? -Yes, Mr Sankovich -Um. What if we don't have any sins? -Son, we are all guilty of sins No matter how small it may seem to you you, me, the guy down the steet it doesnt matter. -But I mean well, I don't think I've done anything wrong I haven't broken the ten commandments or anything like that. -Nonsense! Theres more to this than the basic ten commandments. Theres the sins of every day life. The sins of human need. Why, Mr. Sankovich, you could easily be accused of having committed the sin of pride. The sin of Narcissism -But I'm not! -You lift weights! You take excessive pride in your appearance. Its one thing to stay fit but you've taken this practice to access -But doesn't the bible say the body is like Gods temple? -Son, do you measure your biceps? Do you check your physic in the mirror? -But I don't -Yeah, Reverend I do. -Then you've but the love of self over the love of God. And you've sinned. And you must pay for your sins as we all eventually do you are all sinners. No matter what you man think, as Mr. Sankovich here has also thought, you are far less perfect than you believe. And only I can fix that for you Only I can bring you closer to God Mr. Sankovich, you shall go first -I want you to step into the booth I'll step into the other side and act as your confessor What is it, Mr. Sankovich? -I have to sit in there? -Its confessional, son, it won't hurt you. I promise. Everything you confess to me will be kept in the strictest of confidence -But what about all the wires? -Electromagnetic conduction haven't you read the chapters in my last book on electromagnetic energy? About how it aligns your life energy -Yes I have, but, you know, I thought that was for medical purposes, not spiritual ones. -Yes, some. But when you use electromagnetism in medicine. What is it used for? -Healing purposes? -This is healing, son. Healing of the soul. Please. step into the booth -This will take about ten minutes or so. I suggest that those of you who are unfamiliar with the electromagnetic process use this time to study from the necessary chapters of my last book -This is the first time I heard about a confessional. -Keep it down, Mike he's gonna hear you. -BullSHIT! -What did you just say? -Take that candycane out of your ass, MIKE save the prim and proper stuff for when the rev comes out, would you? -I'm not kidding, BILLY. You might not be serious about getting an education here but I am I don't wanna see anybody else get tossed out like Blake did. -Oh, Woop-de-do. Oh, what am I not gonna go to heaven because I said the word bullshit? Oh! I mean, I must have missed that part in the bible where it says, thou shalt not say bullshit. -Thats not what I meant, Billy. It does say you're not supposed to Blaspheme. -OH, come on.The word shit is not Blaspheme for Christ's sake. -Well I tried. If you get tossed, its on you. -Oh, hey, thanks a lot Big Brother, but I think I can take care of myself now. -Okay guys! Knock it off! Mike, you know Billy is just doing the same old shock value routine to get a rise out of you Billy just, shut up okay? -Guys... I bet its some kind of a test. I know it. -You think everything is a test, Paul -Reverend Carmical leaves us alone for five or ten minutes to see what we do behind his back thats exactly what it is. And Billy is gonna get in trouble for using bad language -Oh, man. Stop being such a wet blanket Ugh! Nobody cares if I use bad language. -I do! -Billy, we came here to get away from stupid attitudes know what I mean? -Guys, does anyone care if the new guy gets in on the discussion? -I wish it was a discussion. Its more like a spiritual pissing contest. -Stop talking like that, Billy. -Look, look All I was gonna say, is that I don't remember anything about a confessional in any of Reverend Carmicals writings -Its probably something new the reverend came up with he does stuff like this all the time. Thats why the class is so small. He's trying out his teachings to see what works -Yeah. Maybe he's giving Rusty a new brain or a brain at all couldn't hurt, the way I see it! -Listen you want a role model on what not to do around this place? Go see Billy. I mean he's basically a good guy, but he is desperate to get thrown out of this place. -So why is he here? -I dunno. Just consider yourself warned We all like him but none of us can deal with him except Sam, and Sam deals with everybody. -I have a bad feeling about this. -Its just confessional Paul! -I wonder if it hurts. -No, its kinda like the seam eater in scientology. The level of electricity isn't strong enough to do anything physically I mean, one of those little balls you buy at sharper image has more juice in it than that -Well, Champ! Why does it have to have any electricity in it? I mean what is it just for shits and giggles or what? -Well its a pretty recent innovation but a lot of new religions believe that the electricity can realign your lifes energies stimulate your physicality. You know, they believe that the soul is nothing but pure energy and can be altered by outside energy that kind of stuff. -Like new age crystals! -Exactly. -How would you know? -Because I have studied it for a couple years thats how. -Wait a minute! Let mew get this straight. So you're saying, that old Rusty the muscle head is going to go into that booth back there and then this huge magnet is gonna like...un- kinkle the kinks in his soul? -Pretty much -Whoo! Boy! Sounds a little...you know what I mean? -You know, Sometimes I wonder why you even bother to show up -Cause I love you Mikey!!! -I'm being serious! You question the reverends methods, you turn everything me and everybody else here believes in to one big joke, you constantly need to be the center of attention -Hey! I'm basically here because my parents made me go, okay? and for your information, SAINT MIKE I appreciate everything the Reverend has to say. That doesn't mean I have to agree with it. Unlike you, I have a mind of my own. -Guys! -What are you trying to say, Billy, that I'm like some kind of robot or something? -Truthfully Mikey-Mike? You don't wanna know WHAT I think of you -The reverend is gonna hear you two if you dont stop arguing -Is the ten minutes up yet? -Maybe Rusty is dead -BILLY! -What is taking so long? I mean all the guy does all day is take vitamins and pump weights. How many sins do you think he could pull off? -Hard at work I see -Um, Reverend -Yes, Mr. McCreedy? -We were all trying to study but Billy here wouldn't -I'm sorry Mr McCreedy but I don't remember asking who was guilty or not guilty of following my instructions seems to me that you have all disobeyed, even you Mr. McCreedy. And May I remind you that God appreciates no man setting himself above reproach Consider this while I curtail your freetime for exchange for the time you have wasted here. -Yes reverend -Yes Mr. Sawyer? -Reverend, I hope this isn't a worthless question... -There are no worthless questions, Mr. Sawyer Only worthless answers -Well, I was just wondering, um What was going on in there? -Why don't youask Mr. Sankovich? How do you feel, Mr. Sankovich? -I feel much better. -And what happened while you were inside the booth, Mr. Sankovich? -I confessed. My sins. -Anything else? -There was a light! -You saw a light? -Yes, I did! A light! -Do you feel pure, now? Do you feel as if your conscious has been wiped clean? -Yeah I feel great I feel like I could take on the whole world! -Must be the stereroids -You see The energy inside of Mr. Sankovich has been re-aligned. his soul. His very essence has been renewed he is ready to be taught, to be shaped to think and to learn as a true student of neurocysim. I myself was the first subject to undergo this process and now I shall pass this knowledge along with the benefits of the confessional onto the rest of you. You see it is your will, your very desire to be purged, mixed with the scientific procedure I revolutionized that will cleanse you think on these things. Tomorrow Mr. McCreedy whos own self opinion was his undoing, shall have his turn in the booth. Until then, return to your dorm rooms and study on my dissertation of electromagnetism. Dinner is in one hour. Class dismissed. (tense music) (church bells) (thunder) -Oh man. This is the ticket My muscles got massively twisted up today -Why is the bathroom set up like this? -Well, theres a real shower stall on the third floor, but, uh believe it or not, this place was actually a legit college dorm room back in the 50's problem is, the plumbin hasn't been messed with since the 50's so I guess some pipes burst one winter so they strapped this whole private bathroom into a weird community tub or something Anyway, no one's got the inclination or the money to fix up the old showers. -Why doesn't the Reverend pay to have it fixed up -You mean, Mrs. Buviea. She's the money in this deal, not him. -I thought the Reverend made lots of money off of his teachings -He probably spent it all on rayvac batteries for that freaking phone booth of his I don't wanna know I mean, Mrs. B digs everything the Reverend is about, but she calls the shots around here, not him -But why would Mrs. B spend all that money and property on a place like this? -Well! On one hand you have a hot 30-something widow. And on the other hand you have six strapping young men. Do the math. -Shes not really like that, is she? -I dunno! Theres some weird stuff going on around here. And I don't mean Carmical's rainbox either We had a guy here, you know? right before you showed up? -Yeah that Godly guy! -Godfry -Blake Godfry. Anyways. He was this total sunday school robot, you know, like Mike so I didn't get it when he decided to just leave school one day all I know is one night, I had to go to the bathroom really bad, and I got up and it was after lights out got up just in time to see Blake zippin upstairs to Mrs. B's apartment -What! -Yup! And I'm sure he wasn't going there for a special study group, either. -What do you think happened? -Well, either he was asked up there or...he got a little lonesome one night and decided to see if Mrs. Buviea was still awake. Either way. that was the last we ever saw of poor Blake. The next day they said that Blake had left school so I'm guessing he didn't decide to leave school like Carmical keeps saying Nope. I think he put one toe over the line and either Mrs. B or the old Rev chucked him out of here with his stuff You know they don't tolerate that kind of stuff here -You think that this blake guy was hitting on Mrs. B? -Either that or he wasn't hitting on Mrs. B enough. I dunno. To me the whole thing is a little shady Anyways, my whole thing is I don't even want to be here -So why are you here? -Well, my parents are those big revivalists nuts, it was either this or they were gonna send me down to that Jesusland in Florida God! I wanted to be a doctor but, you know, thats kind of tough when both your parents believe that the only kind of medicine is faith healing So I got the shaft. Now, I'm living in this old brick shithouse rooming with five virgins and learning about Big magnets that zap the sin out of you. Yeehaw! Praise Jesus. -Hey, knock that off -Oh, you mean That? -Haha! -What are you guys up to? -Oh, we're waiting for the steam room Mikey! What does it look like we're doing? Hey MIKEY, Nice chest! What is it, cold in here or what? ha! Hey man thats my towel!!! I needed that! -Roll around on the rug. -Oh, HA HA -Hey did you read the dissertation? -Yeah -Oh, SHOOT the dissertation! I'm so busy unpacking I forgot! -UH OH -UH OH -I just don't wanna make a bad impression on my first day, you know? -Well, I aint no rocket scientist but I'd say you're going about it the wrong way! -Relax Christopher I'll let you borrow my notes (thunder) -Maybe he smashed his thick skull in with a dumb-bell. Maybe he hit himself green and became the incredible hulk -All I'm saying is Rusty is usually the first one in the chow line So, where is he -Well, I'm sure I'll be up all night worried about it. -Thats a good question Mike, I haven't seen Rusty anywhere. -Hes asleep -Huh? -Why would he be asleep? -I dunno. He said he felt sleepy and he just layed down -Maybe his brain got fried in that phone booth thingie. -I doubt it -If something happened to Rusty at the Confessional, we would have known about it right away -Yeah it maybe takes a while for the genetic mutation to kick in. -Shut up Billy! -Kids can't we just have one dinner without you two yelling at each other? Its like being at my folks place for thanksgiving. -Yeah, every night! -Exactly, every night its the same thing -Wow! Its Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hillfigure. What did you have yourself a teenage life crisis while you were asleep, Rusty? -Thats a nice tank top -I just woke up and said fuck it! -Is uh, everything okay Rusty? -Hey guys, I feel better right now than I have in a long time -You're not ON something, are you? -I'm guessing it has something to do with Rusty being his nickname. That will snap anyone after a while. -Well, Mr. Sankovich, lets just see what happens when Mr. Carmical sees this He's gonna hit the roof! -By who? The fashion police? -Hey guys, is there even a dress code here? -Well If Rusty here uses the F-word in front of the wrong company, well thats pretty much grounds for expulsion -Woop-de-fuckin-do (thunder) -Theres only seven places set at the table. Shouldn't there be eight? -How do you mean? -Well, theres eight of us including Mrs. Buviea and Reverend Carmical -Reverend Carmical! -Reverend Carmical doesn't eat with the students Thank you! He has his own estate down the road and he usually takes his meals there. Well! Soup's on Dig in. I certainly hope you enjoy it. Oh! And I have a special treat for you. My husband was a connoisseur This is a very special vintage worth a small fortune I would imagine -What is the occasion for the booze, Mrs B!? -Its wine, Mr. Parker, not booze. You make it sound like I just pulled it out of a brown paper bag. This is to celebrate the arrival of our new student, Mr. Sawyer. So, we're gonna get trashed! Say, thats great Mrs. B! -We most certainly are not going to get trashed, Mr. Parker One glass a piece -Are you sure we're allowed, Mrs. Buviea? -Mr. McCreedy, there's no harm in drinking one glass of wine. Do you think that there is? -Well if the reverend doesn't see anything wrong with it. -If its any consolation, I conferred with the good Reverend before I brought the bottle up and he didn't see anything wrong with it -Mrs. Buviea, do you treat all your new students this way? -Mr. Sawyer. We're excited to finally find six students worthy of our time and effort I'm sure you've heard the name Blake Godfry from the others -Yes. -Well, I'm afraid he wasn't very serious about his studies and generally wasn't the right kind of student for this school so we had to refund his enrollment fee and let him go But! Now I have the perfect class. And I'd say that's something to celebrate, wouldn't you? -Hello, Rusty! How do you feel this evening -Very nice. I think Reverend Carmical's Confessional did me a lot of good. -Excellent -I dunno, Mrs. Buviea. I mean Rusty looks like hes on drugs or something. -Yeah he used to look like he was just on steroids. -Now, now boys. I think its rather nice that Mr. Sankovich has decided to losen up a little bit. -Are you sure hes not sick or something? -I'm fine! Really. -Gentlemen. I'd like to propose a toast. To providence For finally bringing me the six of you -Cheers. -Bottoms up! -A little class would be nice here! -Long life. -Something wrong Mr. Sawyer? -No...uh.. I'm just not much of a wine drinker, thats all -Well one little glass won't hurt you, will it? -I think I'll just stick to water, thanks. -Uh, can I have Christopher's wine, Mrs. B? -Yes, Christopher thats fine. Stick to water if you'd like. (thunder) (creepy music) (thunder) -Billy? Billy wake up! You're having a bad dream Billy wake up! Billy you're having a bad dream (thunder) (heartbeats) (thunder) (heavy breathing) (thunder) (creepy music) (moaning) -Thats right, Rusty follow your urges. come to me. (thunder) -Rusty! Rusty wake up! Rusty where are you going? (thunder, creepy music) -Suspenseful ambient sounds, thunder) -I'm glad you came Rusty. (heartbeats) (thunder) -I chose you to go first, Rusty. You're so strong. You're my perfect little boy -Where am I? What are you doing? Mrs. Buviea! -You came up here to see me! Don't you remember? -I was asleep. -What did you come up here for? -I don't remember -Did you come to take me, Sweet one? I know what you want What you need. -I didn't say... -You can make me very happy. And I can make you even happier -This isn't right Mrs. Buviea. -Go ahead, say it. Are you trying to seduce me, Mrs. Buviea? I've always wanted to hear that one. And the answer is YES. I am most definately trying to seduce you. (thunder) -Rusty, where did you go, man? Shit. -Do you know why I chose you? Rusty? Do you have any idea? Because you're so strong. Because I've dreamt of your hands on me. Touching me. Your kiss your touch your heat thats right let me in let me take you -I can't do this I'm sorry, Mrs. Buviea. But I can't. -What do you mean, you can't? Don't you want me? Can't you take what I'm offering you? -I just. I don't wanna do anything that we'll regret, thats all -Trust me. I won't regret it. But you might. -I better be going back to bed -So be it. -Reverend Carmical! -Hello, Mr. Sankovich -Its the confessional Reverend I gotta get back to it, I gotta make everything alright. -Oh, I'm afraid there won't be any more confessionals for you Mr. Sankovich (thunder) (moaning) (thunder) (creepy music) (heavy breathing) (thunder) (drums) (creepy music) (thunder) -Can I poor the wine, Madam -But of course, Hollice (creepy music) -Where am I? AHH! (tense, creepy, primal music) (thunder) -Is it time, Madam? -Let the ritual begin (terrifying music) (slight electric sounds) -Ah! ah! -Man Uh ah, ah! -We must attend to his things. -Hey, its our first success. You should feel proud. -I won't feel anything until its all ready we still have the rest to take care of -Considering what we've been through in the past, I'd say this is definitely the first step. -Work harder tomorrow I'm growing impatient. -But.. -But nothing Holiice! Its clear that the problem has been taken care of and now you have to help me complete the ritual Bring them to me I'll help you pack up their belongings -Yes madam. -Whos turn is it tomorrow? -Mike McCreedy's -Excellent. I'll be glad to see that one go. -Rusty! Dolls... what in the hell? (church bells) -Good morning -Good mornin -what, no..smart comment? -Nope -Whats with the clothes? -Eh, my button down is getting a little restrictive, so I changed into this. No big deal -kinda like Rusty did last night -like who? -you know, Rusty? the big Muscle bound guy that you always make fun of... Sleeps in the same room with us Ring a bell? -Yeah Rusty, right. -Is something wrong Billy? -No, why do you ask? Actually I feel better than I've ever felt before in my life. -You don't remember having any Nightmares last night? -Nope -Slept like a log -Yeah. Thats why you kept me up all last night tossing and turning. You were having some bad dream or something? -Must have been the wine -Look. We've gotta talk, Billy -About what? -Last night, I saw Rusty walk out of the room, just like you told me that Blake Godfry guy had done before I got here. Do you remember that? -I remember Blake got expelled But I don't remember why. -What are you talking about.You're the one who told me about Blake! -Man, calm down, will you? Look, maybe I did Maybe I didn't. -No, I'm not gonna calm down alright? Somethings going down here and I don't know what it is, but last night all five of you guys were tossing and turning and then Rusty got out and walked away in his underwear. -Haha,What! -Yeah, so I followed him, you know, to see if he was just sleepwalking or something, but then I saw Mrs. Buviea and the Reverend up in the attic and they were talking about all this crazy ass stuff -Sounds to me like you were snooping, Christopher. -Man, what is WITH you! You've like, totally changed its like somebody has brainwashed you or something -No! Look, maybe I don't wanna act like a jerk all the time just to get attention -Listen to me something is going on up there. They've got a lab. I saw it. And up in the lab theres this table, and on the table there was this cloth and underneath the cloth, there was these six slots same number as us and they put a doll in one of the slots -Should we call the police? -Listen to me, Billy Six slots. Six of us. And they put a doll in each slot and Rusty never came back to bed last night either. I waited up all night for him and he never came back! -Look if Rusty ran for the hills last night its his problem, not mine its not yours, either. -Hey guys, whats up? -Hey Mike! Hows it hangin? -Little boys don't know, but little girls they understand, right big Bill? -WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE, GUYS? -Whats wrong with you? -We're just being a little free today, thats all no biggie. -huh! Gang? I think Christopher has finally lost his mind! I think that the school has fried his last active brain cell -Man you guys should have heard the conversation we were having right before you guys showed up -Whats wrong Christopher? -My, don't we all look good today. -Thanks, Mrs. Buviea So do you. -Thank you Michael. Something wrong, Mr. Sawyer? -Christopher here seems to think that Rusty was killed in some freak sleepwalking accident last night -Hahaha, My, what an interesting imagination you have Mr. Sawyer. -You know Billy, he's just joking -Well Despite Mr. Sawyer's flights of fancy, I can tell you for a fact that Thank you! That something did happen to Mr. Sankovich last night after lights out. Evidentially, he had a very bad drug dependancy, and snuck into the bathroom to smoke a Marijuana Cigarette. I could smell it all the way up in my apartment and so I came down to investigate. Thats when I discovered Mr. Sankovich getting high and thats the kind of thing I just don't tolerate So he was escorted off the premises late last night by the police Fortunately the police were discrete enough about the matter and they didn't wake any of you up Mr. Sankovich, needless to say, will not be returning to the school as a result of what he's done Is there a problem Mr. Sawyer -No ma'am -He'll be fine, Christopher You're just getting used to a new place and staying with strangers. All these uneasy feelings will ease up in a few days count on it. ( church bell ) -Nows the time for quiet I'm about to admit that I failed you Yes, I myself have failed my students and worse, I failed the lord our God. I've committed the sin of Pride. Yes, Mr. Parker, you may speak. -How have you sinned, Reverend? -Mr. Parker, I was smug I believe that my machinery was so fail-safe that I didn't commit myself 100% to yesterday's confessional and in my sin of pride, I overlooked the depth of Mr. Sankovich's flaws. I did not realize, despite the extensive blood research that our school requires, despite the many days of taking his words and his actions at face value Mr. Sankovich was hiding from us a severe narcotic dependancy. -Are you going to enroll another student? -No, I will not integrate anyone else into this group, until I can be certain that there will be no more problems, such as we've had with both Mr. Sankovich and Mr. Godfry. And for the rest of you, I fully intend to work harder and more carefully to make sure to erase the sin and and flaws from your moral character. Beginning today, men. Beginning with you Mr. McCreedy. Get to your feet its time for your confessional Step inside, Son. This time I won't fail you. I promise. -Yes Reverend -As for the rest of you I suggest you use this time to study from your textbook I do not want you disobeying me like you did yesterday, is that understood? -Yes Reverend -Look, guys We gotta talk (creepy music) -Can you hear me Mr. McCreedy? -Yes Reverend -I want you to close your eyes Are they closed? -Yes Reverend -Can you feel the energy inside your booth, Mr. McCreedy -Yes Reverend, its making my heart jump -Thats perfectly natural Its aligning your life energy. Its changing you. Just let it do its work. -Yes Reverend. -Start with a series of simple questions The first one Have you committed any sins -No, no, none that I know of -Have you stolen? -no! -have you lied Mr. McCreedy? Have you deceived -No! -Have you lusted, Mr. McCreedy Confess your lust to me, Mr. McCreedy Its perfectly natural, its alright -Yes -Do you touch yourself in the night, Mr. McCreedy? -Yes! -What do you think about when you touch yourself, Mr. McCreedy? What excites you? What makes you want to touch yourself? -I don't know -open your shirt Mr. McCreedy Put your hands on your body Show me how you touch yourself -Oh! -Do you want me? (creepy music) -Who am I speaking with? -Me, Michael. Purveyor of your dreams the tongue inside your mouth the hands on your body you want me more than anything in the world -Anything in the world? -I know you've watched me Michael you wonder what my lips taste like. You like the way I look I'm the one who shaped you Micheal, Molded you Watched over you every night you will come to me tonight, won't you Micheal? -Yes! -Who owns you, Michael? -You! You are my Queen -And you are my beautiful little boy, Micheal! Tonight I shall have you. Remember that. -Christopher You're way in over your head, here Look what happened to Rusty -Thats what I was saying! Rusty is still here somewhere Guys! -Like, how? -It has something to do with what ever is going on in that confessional. -Oh, man Not this stupid doll thing again. -Look, Christopher You're a nice guy We all like you. But, this is too much man. - I think you have some personal issue you have to deal with. -Yeah, it's just not fair to the rest of us. - Ah, hold on guys. Why don't you just go open Mikes booth right now if you're so sure. Peek inside. -Okay... Okay I will! (tense music) - What are doing!? -I was just.. -He was gonna show us what was going on in there. He says that you and Mrs. Buviea did something bad to Rusty. and then you put some weird doll in the attic. -That you tried to disrupt my teachings is not what angers me. What angers me is your deliberate disobedience of my instructions And that you've chosen to spend the time that I was helping Mr. McCreedy confess his sins spreading poison and lies about myself, Mrs. Buviea and this institution. Don't we have enough to deal with? Have I or anyone else caused you pain? Deceived you? Done nothing but befriend and encourage your quest for knowledge -Why don't you show everybody whats up in the attic -Excuse me? -I said why don't you show everybody what is up in the attic? If I'm lying, then I'm lying But I don't think I am And neither do you. -You have no idea what you're messing with here, son. I wish it was easy as expelling you because you got yourself and everyone else into a whole lot of trouble but we're way passed that. You're here to stay. I confront you with your trespasses and you counter with more lies How sick have you become, Mr. Sawyer? How much pain do you wish to inflict upon us. -you must punish him Reverend! -Yeah! Punish him. -Wait, wait! What are you gonna do with me! (tense music) Oh! No! (banging on door) No! (tense music) -That you, Sam? Uh, if you need to wash up I'll be out of the tub in a minute, alright? Just gimme a second. -Just relax Its just you and me -reverend? -Shh Just lay back and relax -I thought I thought you were gone for the evening -I came back just for you -What are you doing, Reverend? -Mrs. Buviea wanted me to speed things up just a bit Don't worry It won't hurt -huh? (dramatic music) -You're gonna make her very happy. Hahaha. (tense music builds) (heavy breathing) -Sick bitch has been watching us! (tense music) (thunder) (music with an air of mystery) -Stop! Mike! (shocking noise) (shocking noise) -I'm glad you came, Michael is there something I can do for you tonight? -Yes -Then come in. (tense music) -Do you want me, Micheal? -Yes -Are you nice, Michael? Will you be nice? Make me warm? There, thats it Now just lay back lay back and let me do all the work to my sweet wonderful -Mrs. Buviea! -Lay back, sweet one This is our time Micheal. Yours and mine (tense music) -Wait! What are you gonna do with me? -Just relax. It doesn't hurt So long as you're a pure sweet virgin. Sauce for the stew, my love. Special ingredient my late husband discovered on one of his adventures -ah! Ugh! (demonic voice)-I need all six of you, Micheal! First I took Rusty, then Paul, and now I take you. Tomorrow I'll take your friend Christopher. When I offer Pecuto my six fine dolls who will grant the power over all the dead souls buried in the earth An army of Zombies more powerful and terrifying than any army of mans Think of it! (thunder) (creepy music) (music builds) -Place him in the Oracle, Hollice. -Ah! -We have another offering for Pecuto tonight (creepy music) Go and get young Chrisopher I don't think I want to bother waiting until tomorrow, after all -You're the boss (tense music) -Well well well Looks like somebody just couldn't stay put what an awful sinning little boy you are, Mr. Sawyer You know you're not supposed to be here, right? I mean how else do you think I keep tabs on you boys while I'm supposed to clean the confessional booth. -Whats going on Reverend? -You're not gonna have to ask that question in about 8 seconds, don't you know? You're gonna live it -What, NO! (tense music) (thunder) -Curiosity killed the cat Mr. Sawyer. You've been most most curious about things that were better left alone. Its actually a shame, you know? the other boys never felt a thing but then they had the benefit of being prepared for the ritual wine and confessional all part of being prepared for the beast. But you You, on the other hand get to do the whole thing wide awake and I understand that its most unpleasant very, very painful -Yeah, I bet you're real heartbroke, aren't you? -I'm not doing this to torture you, Christopher. I love all my babies. But you're just a means to an end. My husband discovered a lot of very interesting things down in Haiti Some were cold, hard scientific fact and others were things that science could never explain or control Poor thing. Thats what killed him, you know? -You sure it wasn't you that killed him? -Haha! What a wicked boy you are, Christopher No. He tried to tap into Pecuto. Into the ritual of turning sacrificial virgins into dolls to give Pecuto their innocent souls to feed upon In exchange for Pecuto's power over the dead, but science ruined it all for him and in the end, Pecuto was very displeased and so, I carried on the good work. I created a fake religion. Put my dear friend Carmical into the roll of a dime store L Rod Hubbard and Presto! what better way to lure pure young boys into my fold than to open up a high-tech bible school -What about seducing them? Is that part of your ritual, too? -I take pride in my work. -Theres one problem -And whats that -I'm not a virgin! -What? Hollice you told me he was PURE! -He's bluffing. Cant you see that? (dramatic music) -OOH! -THE WINE THE WINE IS GONE! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA CHANGE -I heard noises, whats going on? -Man Christopher was right! -You ruined everything! You little bastard! -What the fuck is going on here? -I dunno but we don't want to stick around and find out, come on lets go! (thunder, dramatic music) -Jesus Christopher. You were right. About the dolls and Rusty disappearing. Everything. -Thats okay. I was gonna go to business school anyway (credits music)
