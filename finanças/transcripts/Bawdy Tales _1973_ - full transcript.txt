The slobs asked to be murdered. It's the same with me. It's their fate to get killed. They just had to be murdered, you know? Poor guys! Poor guys us, who got to commit murder. By Christ, I once was hired to stab a damn cardinal. [BOTH CHUCKLING] I'm sticking a knife in his back and he spins and says, "And fuck you, too!" [LAUGHING] That's just like when I murdered this duke... Here I got I got two hands around his throat. When he says, "That's enough, dog." That son of a bitch calling me a dog! Yeah, you dog, you! And fuck you, too. Yeah. God made all of us be crucified. What the hell, do you think anybody's any better than us? A man's a man, nobody's any different. God protects us all, from one-eyed blind men with no hands and wormy cheese that's sour. Let the good Lord protect us from ladies with clap, or piss in our wine. And from skinny priests and fat pigs from the winds of hell and from monks who stink up the world. May God protect all of us from those lousy sons of bitches! My Christ! Well, I'm no worse than all those pricks, whores, pimps and murderers... Cut purses, panderers. Those usurers and bigots and fake saints. Holy men, my ass! Listen to all the crap they hand out! [CHURCH BELLS TOLLING] [SPEAKING LATIN] ALL: Amen. POPE: Dear Cardinal Vicario. And how fare our orphans these days? Well, Your Holiness, very well. General Gaudillo, you have news to tell us of our brave Swiss Guards? It is some time since we spoke last. All is well, Your Holiness. You wouldn't try to keep us in the dark? You refer to our new commanding officer. I'm afraid what you've heard is quite true. All the men of his regiment were told to take an enema. POPE: All 600 of them? All 600, Your Holiness. Oh, dear Lord! Dear Lord! [WHISPERING] Well... We are in good time to eat. Let us dine. Even we confess to a certain hunger. Ah, my dear Duke Ronciglione. Your presence here has just reminded me of the beautiful church that you had restored in the name of the Virgin Mother. Superb, just marvelous. And what news of Don Anselmo, to whom you entrusted your church? He's well, Your Holiness. Oh, at least tolerably so. But he complains of gout occasionally. [ALL SINGING IN LATIN] ♪ [YELLS] [CHURCH BELLS TOLLING] Poor Don Anselmo, the Virgin Mary took him to heaven. He always kept touching, why couldn't he keep his hands off? Poor Don Anselmo. Poor Don Anselmo. A good man, generous, educated, respectful... He must've been homosexual. Oh, Blessed Virgin, help the dear old soul! Nicolino. [SHUSHING] BERTOLINA: Nicolino! Nicolino! [SHUSHING] Can't you show some respect for the dead? Don't tell me I can't call my husband if I please. Do all the pleasing you want. Only a bed's the place to fuck, not here. We must think, my dear, of someone worthy to succeed him. Oh, God, my feet hurt. Why must they walk at this snail's pace? You'll recall that I warned you. Patience, dear Caterina, patience. Patience, dear Caterina. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Ah, he has such a healthy appetite. I tell you, it's truly awesome. For dinner last night, His Holiness put the whole table to shame. Just to begin he had a plate of ham and two whole melon slices. Followed by a great huge heap of lasagna, which is his favorite dish. Ah, what a pleasure to watch him eat it! After that, two pork cutlets, lamb and chicken on the grill. Two splendid cheeses. Good Lord above, where does he find the room in his stomach? Then I did take the slender volume from the angel's hand, and I devoured it. It was sweet in my mouth as the taste of honey. But when I had consumed it, I felt a bitterness in the depths of my bowels. A voice whispered within, "The hour is not yet come to relax your search." This world that imprisons our souls is shallow and fatuous... Lacking in conscience, perverse, corrupt, impious. A world of flesh, a world enslaved by flesh. This doomed world wallows in sin. Upon this world I see only blood and death! What's wrong, Caterina? Is something wrong, dear? You're so strange lately. [LAUGHING STIFFLY] The strangeness of growing old. Who says so? [CHUCKLING STIFFLY] Whenever we've made love lately, you've seemed so distant. There has to be some reason. All that really matters is that I am here with you. My dearest treasure... My pussycat. My lovely pussy. Wake up. Go let him in. [MEOWING] Come in. Follow me. [MEOWING] [BOTH LAUGHING] [ALL CHATTERING] It's the priest. The new priest is coming! Hey, it's the new priest, right up there! MAN: He's coming! GIACOMO: Dearly beloved, it behooves us above all to express our gratitude to our noble benefactor, His Excellency the Duke of Ronciglione. It is he to whom we must express our gratitude for our newly restored church. It's restoration was due to him alone. May we all be worthy of his generosity. Unmannered country folk though you are, now you will have the opportunity to learn to live in a higher and more civilized manner. To this end, I call upon each man here to sanctify the feast days, to live in the pure Catholic manner. In other words, do not rob your neighbor of his goods. Avoid pasturing your sheep in your neighbor's fields. And this above all. Do not covet your neighbor's wife. [SINGING IN ITALIAN] ♪ I wonder why is she keeping us waiting?

But that's not what has changed. It's not that, Caterina. Have you been waiting? Who wants to be first? All right, who wants to be first? How about you going, huh? Well, I just finished my dinner.

Good, then tell me, have you an adequate sexual relationship with your husband? Nicolino has his special likes. But, of course, your contacts follow the rules of nature. Well, once in a while Nicolino will say, "Turn around, Bertolina." And you? I have to commit a sin, padre. With other young men also? No, no, padre! You harbor the thoughts? BERTOLINA: No, never, padre. And should one make an obscene proposition? I'd tell him no! Though he who asked were I? What reply could I give? Suppose I really do propose it? You're a priest, you're supposed to be praying for our souls. It would be unforgiveable to commit a sin with you father confessor. I've been told that women who make love with their priests or with monks, or with any kind of padre... I've heard the devil takes their soul to hell. Stupid nonsense, those are tales old hags and witches tell to frighten you. We must not forget that your father confessor is only human like your Nicolino. It's not so, padre. You are so much better. But... But what, my dear? Don't you want to be nearer to... To the church? Then how shall we do it? We'll do it very well, don't you worry. And no one will be the wiser for it.

Flesh will be torn, our bodies will be rent asunder. Excuse me, if you will my dear ladies. I shall return. I am so sorry to interrupt, but this is most urgent! Of course. That matter is extremely delicate and of pressing importance to me. Your Excellency, your wishes are my command. I know that you are my wife's confessor, padre. She makes her confession every Friday in the convent chapel. Does she not? Indeed she does! Your spouse is most devoted to our mother church. Quite. It's one way to keep busy. The ladies of our society are devoted churchgoers. It's their marketplace for the latest gossip. But that's not what I wanted to talk about. I will come to case at hand. I respect the secrecy of the confessional of course, and I would never suggest that you violate your principles. I value the esteem you place on our vows of secrecy. But, you see, my wife's secrets are another matter, and that's where you come in. [CHURCH BELLS TOLLING] Ah! How imponderable are the secrets of those who are called female. That's well spoken. I was sure you would help. Naturally, there can be no question of your violating the secrecy of the confessional. I'd never ask that. However, were it possible for me in some way to listen in... But how could you possibly arrange that? You might squeeze me into the confessional with you. It's going to be a tight fit, Your Excellency. Try again! Here. Keep your eye on it! Come on, pitch it. MAN: Get it in there, come on! Hey, Nicolino. There's something I want to tell you. Here, come help me with all this stuff. All right, what do you want? Nicolino, you know that I love you as if you were my own son. I want only what is good for you, and I'm not one to gossip, you know that. I even prayed maybe I was mistaken, for your sake. What the hell are you talking about, anyway? It's about the other day when the priest came to your house to bless it. All the other houses, it took him only a minute, you know, the same old blessing routine that the padregoes through it takes a half a second in your house the blessing took over an hour. He went inside and stayed there. Your wife gave the choir boys a few biscuits to munch on. They waited by your door while the priest, uh... Bertoli, get my things together. A pair of pants and a clean jacket and everything. I'm going to Rome for 3 days, for the duke, it's not my idea, it's just something I have to do. [URINATING] [WHISTLING] Here she is. She's coming. Padre. Padre. Padre. Oh, I didn't hear you call. [BOTH SPEAKING LATIN] Amen. Open your heart to me, confess your sins that God may forgive you. What sins have you committed? Well, the usual padreMatteo, I wasn't very nice to the domestics last week. I got angry at Maria and I'm afraid I was too severe with old Benito, our butler. They don't deserve it. They work very hard. A venial sin, what else? Well, I was also envious. In my defense, however, you must admit that the hat which the French ambassador's wife wore to the party would make any woman green with envy. And against my husband I have also sinned. I confess that I have not always been truthful to him. The other day, for example, while at dinner I told him that his steak was beef when actually it was veal. And what about your carnal sins? This week it was the same as last. I cheated on my husband again. [MUFFLED] With who? With whom? How can I remember all the names? There are so many. There were the usual. MATTEO: How many? Let me think. One... Five... Seven... Eleven. Eleven, yes. [BOTH WHISTLING] A falling star... Make a wish, Nico. I did already. What a sky. You could even count the stars. What good would it do if you did? Couldn't bring them down to Earth. [WHISTLING] If you want to count, count how many more nights we're going to have to sleep out in the cold. Oh, forget it.

God's will be done. With all it is not easy. You are so right! One can only obey God's will. Only trust in His wisdom. I must seek salvation through God's love. My trials are perhaps only God's way, padre. I have an idea, my son. I can find you a post in the home of a person of good character. You would become his valet. The person you'd work for lives alone. Are you interested? Interested? I would accept though my poor talents could never justify your faith. Then as of now, you're my valet. I do need someone, you see. I think you'll do, my son. So as of now the job is yours. Padre,you've opened the road to paradise -if only my talents are of your needs. -Right, right, yes. I'll obey your every desire. -Rise, rise. -I'll be your slave. Come my son. That's it. Now that's right. [POPPING] Agostino, I need advice.

Ah, Don Leopoldo, you yourself are the reason. You have so touched her heart that the poor creature is afraid to confess it. A pity. She was something else, she was. Padre,with your permission, tomorrow I'll bring you another. This one is only 16. She's an orphan, she's ravishing. Mm-hmm. I know you can help this poor orphan, whose needs are purely spiritual. Protect her from the hordes of young hooligans who are after her, day and night. I will, poor Agostino. We'll do what we can. I will use all of my sacerdotal art to help the poor orphan. The poor girl has a difficult time, as you can well imagine. Poverty is no easy counselor. Especially for a young girl alone. The cause is most worthy. I'm not without my possibilities, financially. No fortune, 'tis true, but withal enough to satisfy a poor orphan. Most generous padre, you'll become a saint yet!

Agostino, I'd like to meet her. I'll speak to her. But she is married. The marriage is hardly consummated. It's barely valid. It's not really an obstacle. You don't think so? She needs your help.

[CHANTING CONTINUES] [HUMMING] ♪ [KEYS RATTLING] Get up, Bernardino. We're going to make you presentable before you go to face the good Lord. Hey, Bernardino. I got one more story to tell you about God. You want to hear it? You're ready? I'm all ears. Go ahead. Let's hear it. Okay, I'll give you the whole story. But don't you let me go on if you don't think it's funny. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANING] [TRUMPET MUSIC PLAYING] The fellow's name was Peppe Bellomo. He was really somebody at first. He had a big house of his own. He bought and sold horses and livestock, that's good business. He was really somebody. [DOOR UNLOCKING] MAN: All right, sonny, it's your turn now. Hey, come on! Where's the rest? Tell me more! Well, before they cut me off, I was going to say he went up to his ears in debt because he wanted to please his wife. He went broke on account of her. He sold his horses for a song. He sold everything. And still it wasn't enough so that the poor guy was really going through hell! Margherita, I have gone as far as I can go. I'm not able to do any more. You are young and beautiful, you'll have no trouble finding another man who can offer you more than I can give you. Will you stop that talk? What's wrong with you? Without you I can't go on living. I can't go on like this either, so I have decided to kill myself. You're crazy. Peppe, do you really think I could go on living without you? I've no choice, Margherita. I have no choice. You know what's happened, so what's the use? I have lost my manhood. Very well, if you have decided to commit suicide, we'll die together. What are you talking about? You have to live. You have everything to live for. But I am not afraid to kill myself if that's what you think. You just tell me how, and I'll do it. You're sure? I'll do anything you say, I said I would die for you and much more. You know how much I love you! What would you do to prove it? If you look at me, it's embarrassing to say. You'll make me feel too shy. Now, finish what you were saying. What would you do to prove it? First, promise me that if you don't like what I'm going to say, you do whatever you want with me, you can even kill me. All right. Say it. There are those who'd give us money if I would give them something. If you don't want to we'll die tomorrow. But not tonight. We'll make love tonight. Tomorrow's another day. Who is he? What's his name? Celestino Paoletti. The butcher? -Yes. -That dirty old baboon. What difference does it make to you? Come on, I'm waiting. All right, we will do it, Margherita. After all, why not? That's good. He's rich enough for all three of us. Everything will be fine. I'll have to pretend I don't know. No, on the contrary. He wants you to agree to it. What does he want, a contract? He wants to know you'll do it. You see he's afraid of you. He's right. If I'd found you both in bed, I would've killed you and you know it. I hope you would. MAMMONE: Love, love, love! It's all a game. God gave the egg to the hen and the spurs to the cock... He gave long hair to women and made men crazy enough to think they'd be faithful. Hey, Mammone. They're in one goddamn rush, aren't they? Here comes the padrenow. My son, let us prepare you for the long voyage which will lead you into the presence of God. Celestino Paoletti was an old man of nearly 60. And I must say, he managed pretty well, considering his age. He ate well, he drank well and he liked the rest, too. So, anyway. They moved in with him, and it was all one happy family. And they didn't give a damn about what people said. [SPEAKING LATIN] [TRUMPET MUSIC PLAYING] PEPPE: Hey, old man, how you sleeping these nights? You dreaming pleasant dreams? You two bastards, humping the same wife. [BOTH LAUGHING] [MAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] ♪ [GLASSES CLINKING] Here's to you. Here's to us all. BOTH: Here's to you! "A true gentleman knows how to look the other way." "Anyone who lives without honor will die without knowing shame." "Talking of death can spoil a good meal." [ALL LAUGHING] [MONKS CHANTING] Who would have thought this could happen to us? Mammone, it really makes me sad that it's happening to you. MAMMONE: So, anyway, Peppe would screw his wife now and then, but he didn't have his heart in it like before. So he practically stopped screwing her? Well, no. What I mean is there was no pep in Peppe's screwing. So Margherita, she knows it and she says, "What's wrong? You're not putting your heart into this, Peppe." So she got herself another guy. Right, a young buck, hung like nothing you ever saw. Talk about a stallion. I would show you if my hands weren't tied like this. The bastards had to do it. [SINGING IN ITALIAN] ♪ Got something on his mind. You bet he has! [MONKS CHANTING] Say, I bet I can tell you how it finishes. Not in 1,000 years. You have no way of figuring out what the end of my story is gonna be. What do you want to bet, you bastard? You name it. [EXCLAIMS] PEPPE: Good morning, Celestino. Getting some fresh air? I was waiting to talk to you. If you'd like, we'll go upstairs and talk as much as you please. No, not upstairs. What we're going to talk about must be only between us. It's nothing we would want a woman to hear. Have you eaten? No. Then suppose we have some food down at the inn. All right. [MAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] ♪ Hey, suoraMemma, you got something for us to eat? What would you like? I'll fix whatever you like. Fix us whatever you like. To your health! To yours! To us. Hey, suoraMemma, how about a little of that food? You know, we had better hurry, or Margherita'll wonder where we are. She might ask. That's right, she might. That's well said. Huh? What do you mean? Might as well said? I mean that she won't ask. She's not lonely, so why should she ask where we are? What do you mean? I wouldn't accuse lightly if I were you. Perhaps a slip of the lip, Celestino? No, it's not my habit to accuse unless I'm convinced. You'd put your head upon the block that Margherita's been cheating on us? I want to thank you for telling me. It was my duty! Now, what's the next move? You must first catch the two of them in the act. Where, though? Follow me. Hey, suoraMemma! One night I heard a noise in her room. I thought it was you coming home early. I knocked on the door, but no one answered. So I peeked inside, and I saw a young fellow sneaking out the window. He was carrying half his clothes. They must've figured I was watching, so the next night they set up a meeting somewhere else. What a dirty trick! If you need my help, call on me. Thank you. From this day on I'm your true brother. That means for life and for death. Brothers for life and for death! Oh, shit! Little bastard! If I'd only been in your shoes when you saw that kid in our room, I would've murdered them both, like a pair of dogs. Why kill her, too? He's the only one you should kill. And not her? The bitch! What? And break up our little family? There's the meeting place! [MONKS CHANTING] So, the next morning, following old Celo's advice to the letter, Peppe Bellomo pretended to leave town. He said that he had to buy a stud at the horse fair that day. And as soon as he was gone, his slut ran off to the meadow. [CHUCKLES] Mammone, for Christ's sake, they mean it. The sons of bitches are really gonna do it! "The summer breeze caressed her hair. "The wind carried the soft perfume of the meadow. "The only sound was that of silence that lets "you hear the distant voices in the streets." "And the chattering and singing of glad-hearted people who know "the joys of living. Of life under blue skies. Yeah." You're ready, yeah? Yeah, I'm ready. [BOTH LAUGHING] [SNAPPING] Hey, what the hell's going on, huh? Oh, nothing, don't stop. [SCREAMING] [GASPING] [MONKS CHANTING] It drove her mad. Finally they put her in the madhouse, but within a few days she died, so it didn't matter. [CHUCKLING] And the two "brothers," well, they were tried and condemned to be hung the same as you and I are going to hang. Bastard, I told you how it would end. I was right. Fuck you. Oh, you idiot! But it's not the end! Will you let me finish? Then tell me quick! [PLAYING A TUNE] Celestino, I'm going to ask you a question. Would you rather remain up here, or would you rather live again down on the Earth? Please, Good Lord, I'd rather stay in Heaven with You. [WHISPERING] Send him to Hell. And you, Peppe? Yes, please, may I too stay at Your side in Heaven, Good Lord? [WHISPERING] Send him to Hell. GOD: And you, Margherita? I want to stay here too, Dear Lord. Thy kingdom is here, I ask only to stay here with You. [WHISPERING] Send her to Hell. And you, Piuccio? I would like to see the people of our good old Earth once again. Let me return until I've drunk my fill, eh? Mm-hmm... Forgive me, Dear Lord I know am not saying what I should as a Christian, I go to church and worship the Lord. But just permit me the time to eat, and to drink and to be merry. I'd like to enjoy the wine, and women, and, you know... [WHISPERING] Send him to paradise.
