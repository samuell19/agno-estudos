It's probably a series of coincidences, but the home office is kicking and I'm handing the kicks on to you. I'm told we're indifferent, complacent, lax, and unimaginative. That we never move until public opinion makes us and then it's usually too late. And there's some truth in the accusations. Five insured persons have been found drowned in the last eight months and not one of you has brought in a scrap of evidence as to who benefited, though all the claims, heavily underwritten, have been met. What can we do without a lead from the so's office? They can't move without evidence. You will have to work alone. Persuade where you can't command. Who's got e area? I have. Three of the five cases are yours. You'll have to go through your insurance companies with a fine toothed comb. Yes, sir. That's all. If, as I say, it is simply a series of coincidences, let me have something definite enough to publish. All right. Oh, uh, holt. Yes, sir? The extradition of the man grogan from America. He arrives the day after tomorrow and I've made my arrangements, sir. They think so much of your prodigy in America that they've sent a lieutenant O'Reilly from the Chicago police department along with him. He'll be staying a while to study our antiquated methods. I'll attach him to you, then he won't learn anything. Yes, sir. Hello, extension seven? Send me up a pot of tea. Dr. orloff, I can only be terribly grateful to you for this loan. I know you for an honest man, Stuart. I can read it in your eyes, so I trust you. You do know that in the event of my invention being accepted by the government, I'll be wealthy again. If you'd like me to sign a... Yes. You might do that. Would you care to make over your life insurance to me? I am not insured. But you should be. That's the insurance broker speaking, the businessman. The most charitable man I know. And the greatest of these is charity. Yes. Now, all I want you to do is to sign this simple note to pay me back the sum I am so happy to lend you. You're a very good man, Dr. orloff. I wanted to be, Stuart. I wanted to devote my life to the healing of mankind. I wanted to be a doctor. But they got together, those narrow minded, prejudiced medical men to see how they can rule me. Brilliant, but unbalanced, that was the verdict. And so I serve the blind. You mean you... Here in greenwich, Mr. Dearborn, himself blind, runs a home for blind vagrants. If you would like to express your gratitude for the little thing that I have done, send him a donation. Or better still, go and see his home yourself and learn the joy of giving charity. I will. Here. Here is the address. Call on him tomorrow evening. I'll let him know that you are coming. I most certainly will. Do. Goodbye. Goodbye and thank you again. Grogan arrives the day after tomorrow under police escort. He will be allowed bail, pay it. You're dumb Lou, aren't you? Good luck to you. Send this in all the evening papers. And open the window. Get out. Dr. orloff? Yes. I am Dr. orloff. I'm a detective inspector from Scotland yard. How can I help you? Well, for certain purposes, we are making a check on all recently insured persons. May I ask with what object? Well, it's a formality concerning a case under investigation. They're asking the cooperation of all insurance companies within a certain area. Only too willing to help you if I can. Thank you. May I see your books? Uh, certainly. We don't do a great deal of business. We have only very small connections, you know. Any particular name you are looking for? Yes, ingle. Ah, yes, a sad case. Why ingle should take his life... The verdict was found drowned. Was it? I had forgotten. Ingle was insured for 20,000 pounds. Yes. Who was the beneficiary? A woman, I think, not his wife. It was all quite in order. Where is she to be found? I can give you an address, but I have a notion she went abroad. I'd like it, please, together with his surrendered policy. Oh, certainly. Did you insure a miss Ursula sable? Yes. She was found drowned too, wasn't she? Yes, an extraordinary coincidence. Am I being suspect of foul play? No, Dr. orloff, but in the public interest, cases like these must be investigated. Oh, I appreciate that. Who benefited in the case of miss sable? Actually, I have to look that up. Yes, Saul, Samuel, sable. Oh, yes, Mr. Carlo hesher, a Romanian, I think. The policy was drawn up as a guarantee for money left. Well, has Mr. hesher returned to Romania? His last address was the midland hotel in Manchester. Well, thank you, Dr. orloff. Have you all the information you wanted? I may have to call on you again. I am always willing to help. Thank you. Answer it, Jake. Hmm, you've been a long time, Lou. Darkness spread over the earth and neither was the light in the heavens nor on the waters of the earth. The eyes of men were blinded because of their inequities and the hardness of their hearts, so they remained for seven days that were seven nights and voices of mankind arose, lamenting, give unto us a sign that we may see for we repent our sins and will not trespass again. And on the seventh day, the sun shone in the heavens, giving light on mountain and on valley, on river and the multitudinous sea. And they who were blind did see again. Oh, hello, Lou. I wish to see Mr. dearborn. Why, what's this? Stuart, I'm glad I'm here. Mr. dearborn has been called away on an errand of mercy. The pleasure of showing you around will be mine. Come this way. Here's where they are taught useful occupations. Dearborn believes that by contributing to their own keep, they will preserve their independence and self respect. See how nimbly they work, their fingers are their eyes. Through there are the kitchen and the dormitories. It's a splendid work. Something I'd like my daughter to see. Daughter? What daughter? I thought you had no relatives. Where is she now? On her way back from America. Will she live with you? I suppose so, for a while, anyhow. Well, that's surprising. Uh, where were we? Oh yes, yes, I wanted to show you my special department upstairs, the medical clinic. It's odd, Mr. Stuart, isn't it, how life has compensated me. Compensated? Oh, yes, with the care of these poor creatures. Ooh! I'm very sorry, have I hurt you? No more than a steamroller would have done. Nice work, flat foot. Hey, uh, are you holt? I'm O'Reilly, Chicago police department. Hello, hi. Go on, well educate him. I say, I'm sorry about that girl. Ah, she'll get over it. Here's your man, grogan. Oh, good to have you back, grogan. Yes, I'll bet you are. I won't keep you a minute. Hey, wait a minute. I say, I really am awfully sorry. Is there anything I can do? No, thanks, I'm taking no more risks. Taxi? Oh, I say, wait a minute. Hey, you wait a minute. Ha, ha, ha. Home, James. Well, grogan, how are you? Colossal. I hope you've lost the perishing key. Yes, where is the key? Key, oh, I've got it here. I had it, uh, somewhere... Is it in your trouser pocket? Um, you try. Hey, wait a minute, I know where it is. Where? The captain has got it back in Chicago. I could sock you right on the nose. I got a good mind to let you. Well, and who's supposed to be looking after you two? Oh, that's all right, officer, this is my way of being a joker. I'm inspector holt of Scotland yard. Oh, and who's he supposed to be, Dr. Watson? Come on. Now, listen to me, will you and... Hey, wait a minute tell him who we are. You'll look very silly when I get back to the yard, sergeant. I'll look pretty silly if you don't you'll be missing a couple of them if you don't look after him a bit better. I think your english police are wonderful. You've done very well. I always said you'd go far. My only fear was how far. With the greatest difficulty, I have kept your lower form antics out of the public papers. Lieutenant O'Reilly, I have to inform you that the yard is a dour, soulless place of business, where hijinks, jitterbugs, and horseplay of the more imaginative kind are severely discouraged have a cigar, commissioner. I don't smoke cigars. I understand that bail for the man, grogan, has been offered and will be accepted by court tomorrow. You want to hold him? No, sir, not as long as he's under observation. Very well. Yes, this is the commissioner. Yes. What? Oh, it's for you, holt. Hello? Yes, holt speaking. British emergency call coming through. Hello, river police, you're through. What's the place? Surrey, old stairs. All right, don't touch anything. Yes, I'm coming now, yes, instantly. Exchange, transfer me. I want transport m1, another river case, sir. Holt speaking. I want a car at the front entrance in four minutes. In case he should forget to make a mess of it, you'd better go along with him. Yes, sir. Anything been touched? Not a thing, sir. Step back. Hey, what is this, quicksand? Take a dredger a couple of weeks to get that up. Tailors, hillingram and Curtis. Name, Henry Stuart. 142 billingham mansion. Part of a broken cuff link, it's marked hs. You can't make a homicide case out of half a cuff link. Ambulance is coming, sir. All right, have him taken to the mortuary tell the doctor run the rule over him. Aye. Keep back, keep back, please. Make way there, come on, get back. Fenton, issue the usual notices and try and get him identified. You're taking a lot of trouble with this case. Well, perhaps I think it's worth it. Well, maybe I got a thing to learn. Maybe you have. That'll be all. You can cover him up now. What do you make of it, doc? Oh, simple case of drowning. Mucus froth about the nose and mouth, water in the air passages and lungs, about a pint of it in the stomach. No marks of violence? None whatsoever. It ain't even murder class b. It's either an accident or suicide. How long has he been dead, doctor? About three hours. Was the water you found in the stomach muddy? I haven't had time to analyze it yet. Oh, let me know when you do, will you? A relative has just arrived, sir, to identify the body. Well, you wait here, will you? Right. - Miss? - Stuart. Do you remember me? I remember. What's happened to my father? There's been an accident. He's dead? Well, it may not be your father, but we have to make sure. You must be brave. Are you ready? Yes. Tis? He was found drowned in the thames. I think he died quite painlessly, miss Stuart. I can't believe it. Perhaps you can help us to throw some light on it. I can't now. Can't she take it, that girl? Without a whimper, too. Yeah, she's plucky, all right. For her sake I hope we get an accident verdict. Sergeant Harris just found this, sir. It was tucked away in the bottom of the deceased's pocket. What've you got now? Looks like a bit of braille writing to me. Coming? What I'd like to know is how that cuff link got torn away. Yes, I'm coming. Say, what do you guys think this place is? Sorry, grogan, we've had a busy night. We're sleeping 'em four in a bed in some places. Josie just got him a bunk. Sleeping? How can anyone sleep next to that laughing jackass? We all got our troubles, friend. Ah! Put a sock it in, chum. What you in for? I'm a disgrace. A disgrace to the family. Well, that's nothing to laugh about. What you been up to, murder? No. Drunk and incapable. Well, what's wrong with that? I'm charged with drunk and incapable and they won't change it. Hmm. What do you want to be charged with, highway robbery? No, I want to be charged with drunk and disorderly. Then you're in a tough spot. There you are, my dear, drink that and you'll feel better. Inspector holt can't be long now. I'll see if he's arrived. No, I don't go out for that much either. Give me a gun and a bunch of hijackers and I'm okay. Hey, wait a minute. Tell me I'm seeing things. What is that? Hey, that's beautiful. You fellas get one each, huh? Miss Stuart's waiting in your room, inspector. Oh, thank you. Lieutenant O'Reilly, this is police constable griggs. Glad to know you, babe. You certainly gave me a shock. Lieutenant O'Reilly thought that you were here to supply love and comfort to overworked detectives. Yeah, that's me. Then it may interest lieutenant O'Reilly to know that my main duty lies in the promotion of public morality. Morality, what's she mean by that last crack? I'm sorry I had to keep you waiting. Pull up a chair, O'Reilly. I need hardly say how deeply I sympathize with you. May I say at once that I know my father couldn't have committed suicide. Won't you sit down? You're sure your father wasn't worried about anything? No, I don't think so. Was he in any kind of difficulty? Not that I know of. Well, it wasn't an accident. You mean it was either suicide... Or murder. Had he any enemies? I don't know, but I'm going to find out. Did he know anybody who was blind? I don't think so, not to my knowledge. Could he read the writing of the blind? Braille, I mean. Why do you ask? I don't know. Probably lead nowhere. Now, look here, I don't want you to communicate with any stranger without first letting me know. You don't think I'm in any danger. I don't know what I think yet, but I'd like you to do as I ask. Very well. Oh, Jackson, show miss Stuart out, will you? And ask sergeant Morrison to come in. Goodbye. Bye. Your bag, miss Stuart. So that's why you're so interested in this case. We're not all like you. What do you mean? Oh, ask a policewoman. Well, did he fall for it? He did. Hey, what's going on around here? He's been spending the night in the cell with grogan. Did he steal anything? Made a grab for me paper. What'd he want? The agony column. This. G-r-Oo j-u-h-h-b-i-d. Hey, what is this? Ask codes what they make of this, will you? Right, sir. And I'll have grogan up now. Do you want me again, sir? No. Send up 249, please. Now, holt, this is where I come in. Just leave that bird to me for a few minutes and I'll have him talking faster than Max Miller. There's no third degree in this country, O'Reilly. We catch our crooks by kindness. You'll see. Ah! Listen, you can't do this to me, holt. Take it easy, grogan. I'm entitled to a night's rest the same as anyone else. All right, Fred, I'm gonna see you're made more comfortable. Look, holt, let me have this guy for just two minutes. Now, listen, Fred, I don't want to press this charge against you. When you go up in front of the beak in the morning, I'm not going to oppose bail. Why don't you give him a civic reception? Who's standing your bail, grogan? Just a friend, a loving friend. Oh, you don't feel like telling me. Not when I'm going to let you out in the morning? Just put yourself in my place, inspector. All right, grogan. And you won't oppose the bail? No, no, I won't oppose it. If ever I have a son, which is extremely unlikely, I'll name him Larry. Come on, Fred, back to bye-bye. There's no need to use your hands. This is no police station, it's a sanitarium. There's always tomorrow, O'Reilly. Come in. Oh, did they make anything of it? Yes, schoolboy code. Gro, obviously grogan, written in plain to attract his eye. The rest is simple code. The first letter in this case, g, is a. H is b and so on. What's the message? Gro communicate orloff. Orloff? Doctor orloff. Any good? Well, I don't know. Except that grogan's strong suit is forgery. And that piece of paper I found in Stuart's pocket was a message in braille. Come along, St. Patrick, we will see what the photographers have made of their end of it. Oh, grogan's going out on bail tomorrow morning. Have him tailed from the moment he leaves the courts. Very good, sir. Call me every four hours unless it's something hot. Yes, sir. You've got the prints of the Stuart's exhibit? Um, yes, they're just through. Project them, will you? Uh, Mr. porthrow, project these. Put another one in, will you? Have you got a table of the tides? Now, the pathologist's report says that Stuart died three hours before we found him, near high water Mark at 10:00. What was the time of low tide on the night of the fifteenth? 6:30, sir. Then Stuart was drowned near high water Mark, five and a half hours before the tide reached there. Sure, sure, but the poor palooka was drowned, wasn't he? And there are no marks of violence. Thames water is muddy, O'Reilly. Well, don't I know it, I lost a presentation cigar case in that mud. Hello, give me extension five, will you? Dr. wiley there? Inspector holt. Dr. wiley. Hello? Yes? It has just been analyzed. I've got the tube here before me. The water in the man's stomach was just clean, clear tap water. Thanks, Andy. Send up the sample, will you? Tap water, not river water. Stuart wasn't drowned in the thames, he was drowned somewhere else and dumped there afterwards. Well, for the love of Pete! Extension eight, please. Hello, Mr. Slade? Oh, hello, Tim. Have you had the report on the braille writing? Oh, good, I'll come along. Oh, and Tim, order some tea, will you? Have those sent up to my office, will you? Hello, Tim. This is lieutenant O'Reilly. Lieutenant O'Reilly, Chicago police department. Where's the tea? It's coming. What'd you make of that braille writing? Very little. The water's obliterated the greater part. The first three letters are m-u-r. Is that all? That's all. Well, there are very few words beginning with m-u-r and one of them is... Murder. You said it, big boy. I'll keep that, Tim, and you can drink my tea. Remember Tim, Chicago police department. Goodbye, Mr. o'brien. Say, honey, you don't have to take care of my morality in the daytime, do you? Here, it's done. And you wouldn't have made me do it if I hadn't needed the money. It's not the first time you've signed a signature that wasn't your own. It's the first time I've signed one of a guy what's been murdered. There is no question of murder. Oh, yes there is. The cops are saying there is and the papers are saying so, too. So, you won't be able to come near me over price amounts, will you? Are you threatening me, grogan? No, no, I'm not threatening you. Don't you worry, I won't squeal, I'm not that kind. No, you won't squeal. I'll see to that. Here, what about the dough? I'm not in the habit of breaking promises. Put your things away. Taking out a policy, grogan? You know Mr. grogan, inspector? Yes, I do. How can I help you this time? Listen, I thought you was gonna lay off me. What's this man doing here? I don't understand you, inspector. I don't like hearing meself talked about, so I'll just hop it home... All right, O'Reilly let him go. In case you are not aware of it already, Dr. orloff, I think you ought to know that grogan's out on bail and that his specialty is forgery. Taxi! Milligan Avenue, mate. Yes, I know all about grogan, inspector. My volunteer activities include the vice presidentship of the prisoners relief association and grogan was asking my help in his defense. The nerve of that guy, asking you to put up the Jack for his mouthpiece. Your colleague is a foreigner. I'm not a foreigner, doc, I'm an American. Over here for a nice little rest and the first thing I run into is a murder. Murder? Man named Stuart, found drowned in the thames. Oh, yes, I read that. Poor Stuart. But surely it wasn't murder? You knew Stuart? Er, not intimately, but enough to know that he was in a hopeless financial mess. I did try to help him. Was Stuart insured with your company? He was, yes. And you enter your clients alphabetically in your ledgers? You mean you didn't see his name entered on the same list with miss sable's. Mr. Stuart's policy is in a different category. If Stuart was in financial difficulties, how'd he pay his premiums? As a matter of fact, uh, I've paid the last two for him myself. Perhaps you would like to see the policy. Will you be good enough to find Mr. Henry Stuart's life policy? Uh, by the way, I have finished this. You may return it. Who benefits by the policy? Stuart's daughter? Uh, no, inspector, I'm the beneficiary. You see, Stuart made over the policy to me when he couldn't meet the premiums, in return of the loan of 2000 pounds. This is the policy and this is the receipt for the loan. Suspecting a forgery, inspector? You mind if I fill my pen? Uh, this is copying ink. Use this. I hope you are satisfied. As satisfied as a detective ever is. Thank you. Don't hesitate to call on me whenever I can be of assistance. I won't. So long, doc. Give me the list of the underwriters covering the Stuart policy. General life, 9,000. Chapman and underhill, 5,500. Approved annuities, 5,500. All together 20,000 pounds. Claim on them at once. And uh, find me poor Stuart's number in the phone book. I want to communicate with his daughter. Here, whatcha? Oh, blimey! No! Hey, you're wearing me out. Where are we headed for now? We interview Mr. grogan on the fascinating subject of forgery. You're working too fast, what about the murder? Grogan? Grogan. Grogan? Lord almighty. All right, do what you can with the poor devil. I'm afraid we're too late, though. Don't they ever shoot anybody in this country? Now listen O'Reilly, we're onto something, we ought to work fast. You mean faster. Put the light on, will you? Hello, give me whitehall 1212, quickly, please. Poor old Fred. Hello? Hello, send a doctor round to grogan's pad at once, please. And listen, you can take the men off his tail, he's slipped past you for good, I'm afraid. Now I want... What? When? No, don't do anything, I'm coming along now. Diana Stuart's gone over to orloff's house. How do you know? She telephoned. That girl wants her so and so smacking. Nice work if you can get it. Miss Stuart, I asked you to visit me because in a way I feel a certain responsibility for your welfare. Thank you, Dr. orloff, but there's really no need. I have a little money of my own and I shall work. What do you intend to do? First of all, find the man who killed my father. You're very determined. Wouldn't you feel the same? Of course. But don't let your sorrow dwell on your mind. Work will help to heal it. Now, I have a very dear friend, runs a home for the blind. He himself is blind, needs a secretary who can see to help him. Oh, I should be very grateful, Dr. orloff. Then I will arrange it now. You are very kind. Dearborn, this is orloff. Oh, the young lady I spoke you about. Yes. She's very interested. Yes, yes, she's ready to commence work right away. Quite right. Yes, goodbye. There. Thank you, Dr. orloff. And the question of salary you can safely leave to me. And now I'll say goodbye. My man has a taxi waiting for you. Now, don't brood on the past. Think on the future. See miss Stuart to her taxi. Goodbye, miss Stuart. Goodbye. Where to, miss, please? Bellingham mansions, palace gate. Bellingham mansions, palace gate. Driver, stop, you're going the wrong way. All right, miss Stuart, I know my way about. You! And the I on the back is for Larry. Didn't I tell you... And I phoned your office. And Dr. orloff wanted to talk to me about father, so... Now, listen. Another man was killed tonight because he knew something about your father and it might just has easily have been you. Oh, but that's awful. But it couldn't have made any difference to me seeing Dr. orloff. All he wanted to do was to help. He's found me a job with Mr. dearborn at his home for blind men. You've got plenty of guts, haven't you? And you want to see this thing through? You know I do. Right. Now, somewhere between orloff's office and the dearborn place is the answer. That's all I know. Now, you go there, keep your eyes open and keep in touch with me. I'll never be far away from you. All right. And now, where to, lady? Bellingham mansions, please. Whoa! I devoted my life to this work, miss Stuart. But I cannot help these poor fellows as much as I would like to. My own blindness prevents me. Hard to believe you're blind. You move about so easily. Haven't you heard of the sixth sense of the blind? Every sorrow in the world has its compensation. Now, come, let me show you these poor fellows. Listen, men. I want to introduce miss Stuart to you. She is going to work here and help us. Are her eyes dark like ours? No, she can see. See? All right, men. Go back to your work. We'll ask the doctor, Lou, what it is. I'll ask him. This is our little hospital. It was given us by Dr. orloff. If anyone gets ill, he comes here and attends to them. Well, how's the patient? What's wrong with him? Nothing serious. Dumb Lou is a very good musician, miss Stuart. I should like to hear him play one day when he feels a bit better. Lie still. Lie still and rest. Come, miss Stuart, we shouldn't disturb him anymore. You heard what he said, Lou, you must lie still. Somebody's here. Who is it? I'm inspector holt of cid. I had an inquiry to make, so I took the Liberty of coming right in. I'm at your service, inspector. Here is a piece of paper. On it is written a message in braille, I wonder if you'd be good enough to read it to me. The first letter is m. I can't tell you what the rest are. They are not decipherable. That's a pity. What is the import of the paper? They were found in the pocket of a drowned man. You distress me, inspector. So unless you wish my help further, I will ask you to excuse me. Certainly, Mr. dearborn, and thank you. Ring him at six. All right. Thank you. Miss Stuart, after you've prepared the paying in book for the bank tomorrow, you may go. And should Dr. orloff arrive, please tell him I'm very anxious that he attends to Lou without delay. Very well, Mr. dearborn. You think the old boy was foxing? What ever gave you that idea? All right, let's head back. How is he? Did my injection have the desired effect? Try to find Mr. dearborn, Jake. I shall have to make another experiment. Sit up. You have been very foolish, Lou. You have been writing on little bits of paper. The police have been here. They might come back, Lou. They might ask you questions. You're blind and you can't speak, but you can hear and that will never do. What? What, what was that?! Hello, Dr. orloff. Good evening, miss Stuart. Lou is all right now, I have been attending him. Good evening. Goodnight. You know where the young lady lives, Jake. She's a difficult young woman, Jake. Perhaps you'd better see her safely home. It's ironic that Stuart should be carrying in his pocket a message that was to cause his own death. A message sent to a blind man yes? Investigation bureau. Henry Stuart was insured by the greenwich insurance company for 20,000 pounds. Three firms underwrote the policy for the full amount. Got him. Who? Orloff, Dr. orloff. You mean that nice doctor guy? Now, listen, I've been checking up on that nice doctor guy. Doctor, I thought it was bogus, but it isn't. He'd be a practicing physician today if a megalomaniac streak hadn't got him into trouble years ago. Now he runs an insurance company. He takes out bogus policies, forges the signatures of carefully selected people and lays off to some of the underwriters. Yeah? He waits a reasonable time in paying the premiums and everything is straight and above board. Then neatly bumps them off. Collects the money from the underwriters, makes a fictitious entry in his book saying the money has been paid out to persons who don't exist. Hello? Hello, Diana, yes, I'm glad you rang. Listen... You listen. Just before I left, I had to go through dearborn's accounts and I found a check from my father that hadn't been paid in attached to a letter saying that Dr. orloff was arranging for him to pay a visit to the home. Does it say when he was going? Yes, he was to go on the evening of the fifteenth. The evening of the night before we found him. Does it say anything else? No, what do you want me to do? Just a minute, something's happened to the lights. Hello? Hello, hello? Diana, what's happened? Diana! What's the matter? I don't know what. For god's sake, get me a car and hurry! Bellingham mansions, palace court. Come on, let's bust. Right, ready? It was Jake! Jake, the man from the blind home. Larry, you don't want me to go back there now, do you? I can't, I daren't! Yes, you dare. I've got to have sufficient proof that orloff's a murderer and his last victim was your father. All right, I'll do it. But you will be near, won't you? I will. Ah, I missed him. There's a fire escape out there. Still, it was good to hear the old music box again. Well, what next, Sherlock? Well, as the walrus said to the carpenter, the time has come. We'll call out the squad and surround orloff's office. Atta baby! I'm coming with you. You bet your life you are. All right, stay with miss Stuart, I'll call you if I want you. Search that room! Boy, oh boy! Well, it looks like he beat you to it. Yes. What a payoff. He won't get far. Hello, Scotland yard. Hello, holt speaking. Get this over to the hue and cry. Wanted for murder, doctor orloff, 48, hair graying, blue eyes. In spite of a nationwide search, orloff has so far managed to evade capture. Every hour reveals the magnitude of the insurance crimes he so diabolically engineered. It's incredible this man, who is our benefactor, should have murdered your father. Come in. Uh, who is it? Inspector holt. Oh, I remember. What is it this time, more braille? No. Tell me what you know about Dr. orloff. Dr. orloff, as I knew him, he was one of the kindest men I ever met. He was our most generous supporter. Oh, no, he wasn't. He used you. He gave money to your institute in order to get the blind men here as dupes. Mr. holt! I shall like to see this hospital of his. I will take you there. You didn't say anything about Jake, did you? No. Don't. Holt wants to keep him on the sidelines. One of our inmates is a patient in the hospital at the moment. We shouldn't disturb him any more than we can help. I'm investigating a murder case, Mr. dearborn. Yes, I understand that. This is the man, Lou. What's the matter with him? Some nerve trouble. There's a gentleman here to see you, Lou, a police inspector. He wants to speak to you. Lou. Lou. Lou! Is he deaf as well as dumb and blind? No, no, he should be able to hear quite well. Who fitted this place up? Dr. orloff. One of his many charities. Well, what's this? You have me at a disadvantage, inspector. I'm not familiar with any object unless I handle it myself. It's an iron tank. You can run water into it. What's it for? I'm afraid only Dr. Orloff could tell you that. I have no medical knowledge. Lou. Lou! What's the matter, Lou? I'll send along a doctor to see if he can do the man any good. Oh, by the way, have you got a machine here for the writing of braille? Oh, yes, inspector. I want the man Lou to answer some questions. If the poor devil can't see, hear, or speak, he can still feel. So if you will have these transcribed into braille, then he can write down the answers. Miss Stuart and one of the men can do it right away. I'll be seeing you later, Mr. dearborn. You ready, O'Reilly? Goodbye, inspector. I'm pleased we can be of assistance. Thank you. Miss Stuart? - Yes. - Oh. Here is a list of questions to be transcribed into braille. You can read it out and one of the men will take it down on the stainsby machine. The machine is kept in the cupboard by the window. This is the key. Mr. dearborn sent me. Yes, for the braille. I was just getting out the machine. There. Thank you. Just a minute. I want you to hurry, men. Faster, faster. At what time did he perform the operation? Who is it? Henry Stuart's daughter. What is it, my dear? This belonged to my father. How did it get into this house? I don't recollect ever seeing it before. Seeing it? How could you see it, Mr. dearborn? Blind. You're no more blind than I am. You're a fake! And you're shielding the man who killed my father. Since you are so interested, I'll tell you. Yes, I am the man who disposed of your father. And for the same reasons I must now dispose of that poor fool on the bed. Both got in my way. No one can hear you! Please get off! Please don't. Let me go! Inspector holt knows that I'm... That stupid policeman. He stood there and asked me what the tank was used for. Now I will show you. What you going to do? You'll see. Oh, please don't! Don't! Don't! No! Now. This building was once a warehouse and the floor we're on now overhangs the river. Below there are mud flats which have proved most useful. Eventually, the tide releases them the rest you will understand. In your father's case, unfortunately, we couldn't follow this procedure. Jake carried him to the river. Listen, orloff, I'm to meet holt at 6:00. If I am missing he'll come straight here. My dear young woman, I shall soon be sailing down the river. I have my own yacht. They'll know. The men downstairs know nothing, they are blind. Who else will be alive to tell them? Jake! River police emergency call. Report inspector holt. Dropped anchor off the dearborn home. River police calling inspector holt. Craft anchored off the dearborn home. Right. Hey, what is this? We've scared him into action. Make no mistake this time, Jake. Goodbye, miss Stuart. Don't, Jake, please! Don't, listen to me, Jake! Listen to me! Hurry, men, hurry. Don't! Don't, Jake, don't! Please, Jake, don't! Jake! Where's Lou, Jake? Lou? He's gone, Jake. Orloff got rid of him like he got rid of all the others, out of this window into the river. Lou! Lou! What's the matter? Stay where you are. Get on with your work. Lou! Lou! Lou! Jake! What are you waiting for? Do as I've told you. You killed Lou! I shall have to settle with you myself. Holden put a cord around the house, O'Reilly get the door. Come on, search the place! All right, keep calm, keep calm. Get that man some help! Alright, come on! Go back! I'm orloff! You'll get half the money! Thank god you're safe! I hope that guy has sense enough to look for my cigar case. Has he gone? When a dog goes mad, he has to be destroyed. Goodbye, kid. Goodbye. Bye. Oh, yeah, I can see that's the routine, alright. Put me down for a couple of bucks for the wedding present. Hello, morality. Okay, I'll go quietly. Quietly back to Chicago for a rest cure.
