[horns beeping] [intense music] - Yeah, what is it? - Three bank robbers busted a job at the City First National. Right now, they're holed up in a sporting club. The Red 55, that's between fifth and- - Yeah, I know where the Red 55 is. But it's not the kind of place I like to hang around in. Sorry, captain. - Don't be an ass, Malone. They've got hostages. - All right, I'll be right there. [intense music] [suspenseful music] - This is Walker. Give me the chief, quick. Yeah, those three sons of bitches have already killed a hostage. What do you want me to do? Uh-huh. Yes, sir, right. Yeah, I've called in Malone. He's on his way over. Should be here in a minute or so. He's here now. He's moving. Okay, Robert, they say they won't move until they've talked to one of us. You're elected. The chief says we have to negotiate. We have to accept all their conditions. Don't forget it. Robert. I don't want any other victims. A word to the wise, huh? [footsteps tapping] [suspenseful music] - Keep your heads down! Unless you want this to stay in their neck. That's right. Keep calm. [suspenseful music] Visitors. Don't move! Keep it on. I'll talk to the punk. Okay. Pay attention, cop. I'm only going to say this once. We want $2 million in unmarked, used bills. Nothing smaller than 10's and nothing bigger than 50's. No consecutive serial numbers. We want a limo to take us to the airport and a plane to take us to Mexico. You boys behave yourself and you'll get all these good folks back in one piece. Understand that, cop? - No way, pal. [gun firing] - Oh! [water splashing] [groaning] [gun firing] [whimpering] - Great. Just great, Malone. You did it your way as usual. I gave you an order. You were sent in here to negotiate. Weren't you? Accept all their demands. No more victims. - THey're scum. Human garbage. [indistinct chattering] - Don't. [plane whirring] [suspenseful music] [footsteps tapping] [dirt bikes rumbling] [upbeat music] [waves crashing] [dirt bikes rumbling] [upbeat music] [dirt bikes rumbling] [upbeat music] [waves crashing] - It's a great steak, honey. - Well, a great windsurfer deserves no less. [both chuckle] You going out again? - Mm-hmm. You know it. - I wish I was as attractive as four and a half square feet of canvas. - Aw. - Mm. Really. - Well, you cook a better steak. [chuckling] - You will come back sometime, won't you? - Sooner or later. [dirt bikes rumbling] [upbeat music] [waves crashing] [dirt bikes rumbling] - Do you wanna know what I think about that camper? - Should I try to guess, Hopkins? It's meant just for us. - Mm-hmm. [dirt bikes rumbling] [upbeat music] [suspenseful music] [gasping] - Go on and get here, man. - Stop! Ted! Ted! Oh, no! Oh, let me go! - I got her, man! - No, stop! [engine revving] [gasping] No! - Will you move over? [engine revving] - Hey, come on, move over! - Come on! [engine revving] [water splashing] [men grunting] - Ted! Oh, oh! - Yeah! [woman gasping] [water splashing] [woman gasping] [truck crashes] [board slams] - Ted! - Come on. - Get back! You guys leave her alone! [gun fires] [groaning] [woman sobbing] - Oh, God. Oh, God. - Come on. You've broken it off with Alan, haven't you? - Stop right there. Don't move. - Elys, quit trying to paint the subject. - Jill, we have a job to do. Or do you think I should use these flashbulbs in an interrogation room? [dirt bikes rumbling] - I know he does it out of love. - Uh. - Yeah. I'm very fond of him too. But right now, I need peace and quiet and it doesn't work with him. - You know, success didn't come overnight for me. I worked my tail off and it's hard to stay on top, but I'll hold on. When another photographer is mentioned in a column, I know I still have a lot of fighting to do. I've got to concentrate on nothing but my job. I mean it, there's no hope. I suppose that's enough work for tonight. We'll finish this off tomorrow. [upbeat music] [dirt bikes rumbling] - Aren't you leaving too, Elys? - No. I've gotta get a few things ready for tomorrow. - Okay. So long. - So Long Jill, would you turn the light out as you leave, please? - Sure. [door opens] [light switch clicks] [door closes] [suspenseful music] - Who's there? Who's that? Still you, Jill? - Hi. I hope I didn't scare ya. - Oh, you didn't scare me, Alan but you've gotta stop this power game. Don't you listen to the radio? The whole city is terrorized. All the things that are going on and you, you play hide and seek at 11:00 PM! - You're the one who's playing hide and seek with me. My sister's not very good at lying. She never was. - Just like you, keeping bargains. - I just came by to bring you this. You left it. And because I just can't go on without seeing you. The fault isn't mine. My God, I just can't get you out of my head. - Listen, Alan. Let's try to find a compromise. We'll talk often on the phone, all the time, but don't you go back on your word. - Sure. We always wind up doing what you want anyway. [ominous music] [thunder rumbling] - Hey, where you going? [woman gasping] - No! [woman screaming] [tussling] Oh, please! No, please! [door opens] [gasping] - Oh, my God. Oh! [thunder rumbling] [whimpering] - What's the matter, little girl? The site of blood bother you? [bulb flashing] [door closes] [engine revving] [men laughing] Forget that, goddammit! Get out here! She took pictures of me. We gotta find her and get them back. Move your asses! [suspenseful music] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [engines revving] [tires screeching] [truck rumbling] That's her there. I'll get that bitch. [tires screeching] [engines revving] [whimpering] [cries] [tires screeching] [truck rumbling] - Oh. [siren blaring] - What seems to be the matter, lady? - They're murderers! They tried to get me! They're murderers! - She took my picture. That bitch took shots. - She better be taken care of soon, I think. - You don't think! You don't do any thinking! None at all! You listen! - Do something for God's sake! Arrest them or they'll kill me! Please, help me, please! - All right, come on. [truck rumbling] [tires screeching] [soft jazz music] [horns beeping] [cat meows] [Robert humming] - Okay. Okay. Okay. I hear ya, Purvis. Time to eat. Hmm, red can again. Okay. You got it. [Purvis meowing] Oh, shit. I'm in trouble. [Purvis meowing] Okay, okay, I hear ya. I couldn't have a cat that was color blind. [Purvis meowing] We'll try the blue. Hey Purvis, I found one! [Robert humming] [Purvis meowing] Yeah, Purvis, mm-hmm. [humming] I can eat it myself. Mm, this is something else, Purvis. Red label. Mm. [Purvis meowing] Good, huh? You better eat it all 'cause if you don't, I will. [phone ringing] Yeah? Malone. - Robert, you get your tail here in the office. I need to speak to you. [soft jazz music] [knocking] - Okay, what is it this time? - Shut the door and come in. - I hope this is important. I left my cat at home and he's alone. Well? - What we have tonight is another murder. But this time we have someone who saw it. A girl called Elys Trumbo, about to enter her house an hour ago, witnessed her neighbor being killed. Smart girl. She got out of it, setting off her little camera flash, and blinding one of those hoods, temporarily, worse luck. Anyway, she escaped in her car and our pals took after her in their at Jeep camper. I'm betting that that car was the same one that was stolen down at the beach. Malone, you know that double homicide too. It was committed with just that M.O. My opinion, there's no doubt about it. It's obviously the same gang of nutcases we've been after all this time. But there's one important difference. A picture exists now of one of their heads. A portrait. That's worth leaving your cat for, isn't it? - Mm. [soft jazz music] [knocking] - Come in. Ah, here are the prints back from the lab. Thanks, Mallory. Oh, no. Well, what a damn disaster. The flash went off to close. Can't use a single one of these. That's all we needed. I thought it was too good to be true. Wait a minute. In any case, those hoods are sure to try to take out that girl. Robert, from now on, you're gonna be right next to a Elys Trumbo and you're gonna stick to her like glue. - Where is she now? - At City Hospital She's still in a state of shock. We left a cop there to keep an eye on her, but she'll be out tomorrow and you've got to stick with her. Even though His Honor will howl life a wolf. [ominous music] [fire crackling] [thudding] [snorting] [snorting] [groaning] [bottles clinking] [grunting] - You stupid shits. - Hey, what's the matter? - Are you out of your mind? - I said stay away from this. I want you operating. This crap is for weak kids. Little boys who need to work up guts! [plane whirring] It's not you guys. It's not you guys, it's the system. It does us all in. And that's what we're trying to fight against! [chuckles] It's gonna take blood. And not just anyone's, you know that. Just to the people who don't ever have to work for things. Who have it all. [dirt bike rumbling] Okay. What's the news? - The girl is still there in the hospital. [intense music] [dirt bikes rumbling] [man screaming] [dirt bikes rumbling] [banging] - He's in pretty bad shape, poor guy. We better put him out of his misery. One look at you in the hospital and they'll believe you got a good reason for being there. [laughing] [intense music] - City Hospital. She's still in a state of shock. We left a cop there to keep an eye on her. [intense music] [man groaning] - Our friend here was hit by a car. I think he's hurt bad. For God's sake, call someone. [ominous music] [dialing] [slurping] [gasps] [hangs up phone] [suspenseful music] [fist whacks] - Uh! - Come on. Move. [engine revving] [tires screeching] [suspenseful music] [clacking] [chuckling] [pump clacking] [suspenseful music] [squeaking] - Hey, where are you going? - We got a wounded man here, officer. - We got nurses for that. - Now! - Hey! [gun fires] Uh! [gasps] [gun firing] [grunting] - What the hell is this? What's going on here? What do you want? Hey! Hey, get out! All right, what's going on here? Hey, what are you kidding or something? Hey, who are you guys? Are you out of your mind? [gun fires] - Take care of the girl! Hurry! [gun firing] [groaning] [gun firing] [heart beating] [suspenseful music] [pump clacks] [clattering] [gun firing] [grunting] [gun firing] [bullet ricocheting] [groaning] - [gasps] My God! No! No! Get away! Go away! My God! [groaning] Oh! [suspenseful music] [footsteps shuffling] [whimpering] [screaming] Oh, no! [sobbing] My God. [grunting] Oh! [gun fires] [groaning] [sobbing] - Lady, lady. Give me a break with all that noise. [dirt bike rumbling] [whimpering] [sobbing] All right, all right. It's over. Enough with the tears, okay? - Okay. [whimpering] [soft music] [clattering] - You could have taken one of them alive, or am I wrong? - Yeah, you're wrong. - In this particular situation, he had to save the girl. What else could he do? - I don't need a lawyer. You're the ones that were wrong by putting only one guard outside the door. - Why was there only one guard? - Because someone at the precinct thought that one was enough. It looks like he wasn't thinking too well. - You know, that's the problem. You're paid to think. And for both of you, that could be a little trying. Now at this time of night, people are usually sleepy and likely to make more mistakes. - You know, Malone, nobody likes you. - Yeah, I know. Sometimes I don't like myself either, but that's a matter of opinion, and frankly, I couldn't give a damn about yours. All I care about is my work. To finish what I started. And I usually do. Now you asked me to protect this girl. I did. It doesn't matter how I did it. If you still want me to keep an eye on her, she has to move over to my place. - To your bunker is more like it. - That's the way I like it. - Let's see how Miss Trumbo feels about it first. - I just can't take anymore. I don't know what's happening. I'm not in good control. Put me wherever you like. You said "bunker" just now. Maybe that's the only answer. - Okay, Malone. Have it your way as usual. - You ready to go, miss? [soft music] - I may be getting an exhibition. - Is what you do all that fascinating, lady? - Oh, I'm just making chat. We've been in the car for 20 minutes and you haven't said a thing. - Oh, yeah? [sirens blaring] - I didn't think you'd be such a grouch. - Okay. So what do you wanna talk about? I don't know what to say to you. - Oh, well, I don't really have a one track mind, and I don't think you do. - Look, I don't know anything about fashion, lady. - I see. All right, don't talk. It's not your duty. And by the way, if you don't wanna protect me, I've got an idea. Have someone else called in on the case. Or next time just let them kill me. That you take care of your little problem. - I think it's about time you close your mouth. Too many stupid things are coming out of it. [ominous music] [fire crackling] - Come on. Come on. [laughing] [indistinct chattering] - This place is giving me the creeps, you know? I better get outta here. [banging] [intense music] Come on. Let's move out. This ain't a healthy place. - The police sergeant and the girl gotta be killed. You, go to her house and wait. She'll be back there sooner or later. You might see the cop coming too. He's pretty sure to try to hide her. When you find out where, let us know about it. And no fancy tricks, right? [dirt bike rumbling] [soft jazz music] [liquid pouring] [dialing] [phone ringing] [sighing] - Oh shit. [phone ringing] Yeah? - I need you to do me a favor. I want you run down to headquarters, pick up the books with the mugshot in it, bring them over here. - What do you need them for? [dial tone ringing] Hmm. 7:30. Sunday. Day of rest. All right. One, two, and three. - Hey, Mister? You going somewhere? - Who's that? - It's me, darling. Who else would it be? - Oh, I forgot. I'm so stupid. Listen, um... - Miriam. We've been introduced. - Miriam. - Oh, what a quick learner. You got it right the first time. - Sweet Miriam. Forgive me. It's awful, but I have to go. I promise, I'll be back in a flash. Okay? - Uh, I've seen some long flashes in my day and some flashes in the pan. - Mm. Will you still be here? - In a hiding place. - I'll find it. That's my job. - I'll make it hard on you. - I won't answer that. Hmm. - Hmm. [horns beeping] [dirt bike rumbling] [ominous music] [soft music] - No. Not one of these. No way. Nobody who looks at all like him. - Thank you, Miss. You mind coming down to headquarters with us and help make a composite of this man? - Of course I will. But on one condition. I'm Elys, not Miss, okay? Hmm? - Hmm. - It's not much, but it's better than nothing. How do you feel today? Any better now that you're rested? - Lots better, thank you. - Good. [door opens] Come in. Give this to the patrols and to the press. - Where'd you get these ideas from? You invent them all by yourself? - Why - This guy thinks you have a picture of his face. You put this sketch in a newspaper, he'll know you don't have anything. He may never come out of his hole. - Did you hear him? Do as Sergeant Malone says, quick. - We have something he wants. The bait. He's dying to bite. [ominous music] [clicking] [clattering] [footsteps tapping] [soft music] - Robert, I just have to grab a bag and pack it with some old clothes and a toothbrush. Only be a short time. - Yeah, that's fine, but I'll come with you. You never know. Hold it. I'll open it. [lock clicks] - Is something wrong? - I'll check it out. All right, it seems okay. - If you want something to drink while you're waiting, help yourself. My house is yours. There's some great bourbon. - Milk is more my thing. - A man of a thousand virtues. [soft music] [suspenseful music] [pump clacks] [suspenseful music] Aren't you the sneaky one. This is a lady's bedroom, sir. [suspenseful music] Oh. [pump clicking] [gun firing] [bullet ricocheting] [grunting] [gun firing] [bullets ricocheting] [grunting] [rumbling] [groaning] [grunting] [fists whacking] - Where are the rest of your friends, huh? Where are the rest of your friends? I'll break it off! Tell me I'll break it off! [knife clicking] [knife stabbing] [Malone screaming] [grunting] [whacking] [rumbling] [grunting] [whacking] [shrieking] [whacking] [glass shattering] [screaming] [intense music] [clattering] [suspenseful music] - No one can tell who that's a picture of. - Nick is dead, but he sure as hell didn't talk. - If it was up to me, I should have gone instead. [paper crinkling] Now it's time to act. It's time, all right! [gentle music] [Purvis meowing] [chuckling] [Purvis meowing] [fire crackling] - Hi. [Purvis meowing] - If you have to open your mouth then do it just to shove in the food I made for ya. They're on the table. [gentle music] - Mm. ♪ When will you let me ♪ Come on, sit down [chuckling] ♪ Remember to brush ♪ Don't be bad [upbeat pop music] - Couldn't we talk for a while? This is brainwash music, by the sounds of it. [sighs] I don't know how you kids can listen to that. - Daddy, you're hopeless. Those are the Aha. - Aha? I didn't think it was Frank Sinatra. [woman scoffs] ♪ And my spirit is sold ♪ Spirit is sold [woman humming] ♪ Don't say goodbye ♪ Look out ♪ Bad time ♪ Ready or not ♪ Choose tonight ♪ Bad time ♪ Ready of not ♪ Choose tonight [tires screeching] [woman gasps] [thumping] [engine revving] [banging] [glass shattering] - Put the gun away or I'll blow your daughter's head off. Come on out of there! Out, out! - [Radio Host] in our super quiz. Hello? - Hello? [grunting] [whacking] - I'm Terry. - Terry. What part of the country are you calling us from? - Bronx. [fists whacking] - [Radio Host] Have you been following our program for very long? - For the last couple months. [fists whacking] - Is that all? [men grunting] All right, Terry from the Bronx. We've been on the air for 11 years, and you're just getting on for the first time. [fists whacking] [groaning] Are you ready to answer the first question? - I'll try. - Okay. One of our immortal sports heroes, Babe Ruth, or the Sultan of Swat, as he was called... [fist whacking] [screaming] - That's enough! - Can you tell me what city it's in? - He's had it. [groaning] - Come on, Terry. It's not hard. - [Terry] I don't think I know! - Sure you do. - You listen to me. You wanna see your daughter alive? You get me the photo and Malone too. Tomorrow morning at the old power station. - You don't know? - No, I just don't. - Tomorrow morning, Walker. - Take a wild guess. Just try. [Walker gasping] - And no tricks. - Name any city in the US. - Huh? [Walker gasping] - The Bronx? - Or we'll cut up your daughter till she looks like a jigsaw puzzle! - [Radio Host] I admire your loyalty, but it doesn't mean you're our big first prize. We do have a great consolation prize, though. A $20 discount at any Dundee Supermarket. - Daddy! [banging] - [Terry] Thanks, does that mean I can go buy something? - [Radio Host] At any Dundee Supermarket and $20 will be taken off your bill. That's right. - Oh, jeez, that's really great. I shop there all the time! - [Radio Host] That's what we like to hear. Now don't hang up. You've gotta talk with our secretary so she can get the prize certificate. - [Terry] Oh, don't worry, I'm hanging right on. - [Radio Host] Okay Terry, thanks for playing our quiz. It's been nice talking to you. - You too, Mel. Thanks a lot. - [Radio Host] Okay, and don't forget to keep listening to "Mel's Quiz Game" every day of the week at this same... [water flowing] - I feel like I'm going crazy. Damned if I can see any way of getting out of this mess. Damned if I could go along with their conditions. - What's your other choice? - I can't ask you to go. You'd just get yourself killed. And I'd spit at myself for the rest of my life! If I were 25 years younger, by God! - If you were 25 years younger, you wouldn't even have a daughter. - Uh. - Look, Max, I've already made up my mind. I'm going. - But you can't. It's just suicide. They'll kill her anyway. Robert, I know you're doing this, for me, but it won't help. They'll just kill you too. So forget it. - I'm not doing it for you. I'm just doing it. I would do it even if it was Santa Claus' daughter. - Oh, let me go! [indistinct yelling] No! [gasping] - Come on! - Come on! - No! [gasping] [indistinct yelling] [woman gasping] No! - Ain't she wild! [indistinct yelling] [woman gasping] - Come on! [indistinct yelling] [woman gasping] [gun fires] [fire crackling] - Get out of here! - Let me out of here. [pump clacks] Now! - Hey come on, let's go. - Come on, get out of here. Come on, man. - Come on. - Hurry! [woman whimpering] [footsteps tapping] - Not bad for a cop's daughter, huh? - I wouldn't mind tearing off a hunk of that right now. [woman gasping] - You can wait till evening. She's a little too upset to enjoy it right now. [woman sobbing] [soft jazz music] - Robert never knew his parents. The man in the picture is not his father. He adopted him. He was alone too. Old and alone. And they stuck together and with all they went through, they found some kind of companionship with each other. Until one day when the Walls of Jericho came crashing down. Robert was just a kid then. He was still in school. One morning, two drunks robbed and killed the old man. Yeah, you heard me. For seven lousy dollars. Robert survived somehow. But after that, something was different inside him. After he did a stint in Vietnam where he won every medal in the book, he came back and joined the police force. [soft jazz music] He's not a bad guy. His battle against crime goes back a long way. Sometimes I think nothing else means a thing to him. [car door closes] - If I could just, if I could get a beat on him, on that type of man, I'd give a lot to understand him. - What did Walker want this time, Robert? What's so important? Hmm? I don't like the sound of your silence, pal. [traffic whirring] [dirt bikes rumbling] [intense music] - Come on, get out! Move! Tie her up! [clicking] [clacking] - Do you mind if I get something too? Otherwise I'll just look like I'm going fishing. [intense music] Are you give you some cartridges or do I use popcorn? - Don't go out. Don't open the door for anyone. [clicks tongue] Take care of her, Purvis. Is that thing ready? - It's out in the car. Get something to eat. You're losing weight. - Hmm. [Purvis meows] [door closes] Mm. [suspenseful music] [ship horn blaring] [woman gasping] [horn beeping] [suspenseful music] [ship horn blaring] [pump clacks] [suspenseful music] [engine revving] [gun firing] [indistinct yelling] [guns firing] [bullets ricocheting] [groaning] [guns firing] [bullets ricocheting] [groaning] [guns firing] [suspenseful music] [grunting] [thunderous explosion] [screaming] [guns firing] [bullets ricocheting] [banging] [grunting] [suspenseful music] [whacking] [pump clacks] [gun fires] [man screaming] [body thuds] [grunting] - Shit. [ship horn blaring] [grunting] [gun fires] [groaning] [gun firing] [bullets ricocheting] [gun firing] [man groaning] [body thudding] [suspenseful music] [woman gasping] - Hold it right there! Come one step closer and I'll cut her throat. I mean, I'm not kidding around. - Listen, pal. This is a .45 automatic, loaded with led-plated bullets. A shot at this distance could blow a man's head off. I think I know what's going through your head right now. You're wondering if I got any bullets left. Your guess as good as mine. Who's got the odds beat? You or me? Today, I feel lucky. You wanna kill her? Go ahead. You've got the knife in the right position. The sight of blood won't bother me, punk What you waiting for? - Hey look, I- - I don't give a shit. 'Cause I'm gonna take one shot just to see how far your goddamn head's gonna roll. [suspenseful music] [clacking] [hammer clicks] [trigger clicks] [whacking] [suspenseful music] [knife whooshing] [knife stabbing] [groaning] [water splashing] [soft jazz music] - I have to admit that it was a pleasure. It was fun in a strange way though. I wanna say thank you. - You don't have to. Anyway, if I get bored, I know where to come for excitement. - Thank you. See you around. Bye. - Emergency situation. 87th and 2nd. Emergency situation, 87th and 2nd. All cars in the vicinity proceed there immediately. [beeping] [soft jazz music] - On my way. [engine revving] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [indistinct chattering] - Good evening, sir. There'll be a bit of a wait. - I'll be at the bar. [glass clinking] [indistinct chattering] - Sir, what'll you have? - Scotch, double. [suspenseful music] - I'm not an expert in fashion, but I'm sure you've been quite successful. - Uh-huh, you've been doing a little research, haven't you? I can't believe I'm able to relax, Robert. I actually went and did some work this morning, and it actually turned out okay. I was amazed. [indistinct chattering] [suspenseful music] Robert? Robert? In this whole business, you know where the biggest surprise came? When you invited me out. - You gotta eat sometimes. Besides, gives me a chance to get dressed up. [Elys laughing] But your problems might not be over yet. Wait till you see my face when I get the check. - [chuckling] As long as you don't think you can get away with just one date, Mr. Malone. Next time it's dinner at my place. Do you like Mexican food? Robert? [suspenseful music] Robert, what's with you? - Hmm? Hmm? Oh, oh, nothing, nothing. I thought I saw someone I recognized. [suspenseful music] [indistinct chattering] - Well, anyway, I hate to be forward, but I hate even more if I didn't speak up. I think if we managed to have fun even over this last week, we should seriously consider seeing more of each other. Robert, are you listening to me? - Oh, sure, sure. I'm listening. It's just that I never did talk a lot. Even when I was a kid, I always preferred action to words. - So I see. [intense music] [gasps] [heart beating] [screaming] [gun firing] [indistinct yelling] [gun firing] [glass shattering] - Stay down now! - Get under the table! [woman gasping] [car starting] [tires screeching] [gun fires] [intense music] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [cars crashing] [cars banging] [cars banging] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [engines revving] [intense music] [tires screeching] [banging] [cars crashing] [banging] [cars banging] [tires screeching] [engine revving] [car crashing] [glass shattering] [tires screeching] [car crashing] [groaning] [door thumping] [grunting] [clattering] [door opens] [door closes] [sighing] [intense music] [men grunting] [body banging] [men grunting] [banging] [breathes heavily] [soft jazz music] [trunk opens] [thudding] [trunk closes] - Well, have a good trip. I like to see you taking a few days of vacation. You have so many that you never took that you could retire right now. [Malone laughing] - Yeah, I've been wanting to go back there for a long time. Maybe there's still something left at that old gas station. [soft jazz music] - I hope at least you'll find your memories. [Malone chuckles and clicks tongue] - Stop there. Don't move.
