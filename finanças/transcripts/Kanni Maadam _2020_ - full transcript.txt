Don’t think and worry about anything. Be happy. Enjoy. Malar! Kathir! Hey. If I tell you one thing, you shouldn’t feel bad. Kathir! If a girl elopes from a house, they say the girl is strayed. Her name will never change till she proves herself by living happily. You go for a job and earn money. When we both return to our village, people should respect us by looking at our stature. After achieving, we can have this… Sorry, Kathir. Are you angry? Kathir! Okay. Sir. Tell me. -Where have you sent the boy and girl? - Sir, I didn’t send them. - Tell me. - Sir, I don’t know. Why did you brought up the girl so chubby?

If I give a signal, the entire colony will come and kill you. Brother, they might come. Come, let’s go. Or else I’ll lodge complaint in the police station. Don’t stand here, leave now. Get up. Hey, you get up. Hereafter if you favour her, I’ll hit you to death. Then you have to go, where you first wife has left. Being second wife to you, rather I should’ve died. My children are suffering. Dude, I don’t know what will you do. You kill her and bring back my son. This is a bad name for our ancestry. We should get rid from the root. Tell me. I’ll tell you. They have gone to Chennai. Where in Chennai? At Choolaimedu. - I don’t know anything more. - Choolaimedu! Hey, let’s start to Chennai. Kathir! Kathir! How long to knock the door! Hey, this is not like your village. The water container has arrived, go and fetch the water. Use well water only for household. Hey, you bath and do washing near the well and throw covers inside the well. Don’t know what to say about you all! Hey! Wow, Yamaha RX 135! Hey! Hey, Kathir! Come on. Not leaving a car or bike. Looks like the crowd in “Alagar” river! How to fetch water in this crowd? Sister, I’ll take one pot of water. Malar! - Stop. - Go away. You fetch the water. Hey, are you calling him for support? We’re all waiting for one pot water only. - Sister, I've come from outstation. So, you've come from outstation to fetch water? I'm residing in this street. (Indistinct chatters) Hey, no! You made me to get caught and laughing now? I said, don't hit me. You said, you'll take care of me like a queen. Now, you let me to fetch water. You're also the same like any other male. Fraud. Henceforth, you must go to bring water. I'll not come. Won't you switch on the motor, on time? - Who's turn is this week? - It's mine, Anbu. - Then, you'd have switched it on. - I had work the whole night. Go and switch on the motor. Shantha, why didn't you like Ramu? Shanta, why didn't you like Balu? Ramu and Balu is confusing. Today, I should astonish him by my acting. Dude! - I'm coming. - Dude! Welcome, uncle. Dude, I've got a furious chance to showcase my acting. You say like a starving dog got a dosa. I was called for an audition for a new film. Known I'm addicted to lentil snacks, you're going to pressurise me... ...and prove your talent, isn't it? God bless you. Arya is the hero. It's a friend character. - Friend of Arya's father? - No, a friend to Arya. To Arya? Shall I act? Jaishankar, sir! What's lacking in my friend? Doesn't he have knowledge, charm, tone and good thoughts? Just wait, don't be panic. You might pop up in emotion. Just wait, Dude, is Arya acting in any period film, recently? No, it's a college story. - College film? - I'm studying in college with Arya. Arya is in love with Shantha. I'm helping him in his love. Shantha has become old, Samantha was also outdated and she left to Andhra. You're shouting as 'Shantha' now. Hey, oldey! First, get rid of these old style costumes and accessories. Let's see whether you can do better in acting. If I wear all these, people respect me, 'the Square star'. Who gave you the title, 'Square star'? It's me. Who is giving to whom? Everyone is titling themselves. So, I preferred this title myself. Don't you feel ashame? If I feel shame, I can't get an Oscar, dude. First, go and see your family in Arcot. Instead, he is going to America to get an Oscar. Look here, I'll get two Oscars and appear before you, who teased my acting. On that day, we both will hang and die. Go. Do you feel jealous of this film? Next film is with Director Shankar... - Why do you tease him? He is pityful. He has become mad on cinema. Kathir! Kathir, get up. Mom, let me sleep. Where am I? Malar! Is it 11 o'clock? Malar, don't cry. I'm sorry. In sleep, I thought I'm in home and my mother is waking me up... I'm hungry, Kathir. I'll get you now. Just five minutes. I'll get you. He bought us lentil snacks and shown his acting, irritating to the core. Hey! Who is he? Driving like he didn't have RC. Didn't I tell you, I took a ride with a couple in love? - Yes. - That's him. Is it him? Arumugam brother, who is this guy? He is the new tenant next to your house. Brother, it's long time since I asked for idly. Take the idlis soon. - Just wait for five minutes. - Okay, sir. - 'Come on, my dear village girl' - You'll be banged with broomstick. Brother, two tea. Two tea. - Wash the glass well with water. - He is my neighbour. He is sitting here. He looks like a rogue. Why is he running? Do you want auto? - Give me. - Here it is. Have you seen him anywhere? - Hey, I knew him. - Where did you see him? He came in my auto along with a girl. I dropped them at Burma bazaar. Where is Burma bazaar? Do you've Google map, brother? Burma bazaar. Where the blue line ends is Burma bazaar. - I dropped them there. - Come, let's go. I'm from Melur, Madurai. She is from my neighbouring village. We both studied in the same college. We fell in love. It came to my father's knowledge. We belong to different caste. She is from lower caste. My father didn't like it. He blazed her along with her family. It's a great thing, she survived. I don't know what to do. That's why, I tied her nuptial knot in the temple and brought her here. Who is he who came now? He is my maternal uncle. My mother's brother. They have known this place. If caught, they will not do me anything. But, they will kill that girl. We can't stay here, anymore. We will vacate the house and go. Brother, I spoke with my friend regarding the job. Hey, stop blabbering. If you want to go... Where will you go? Did you say only the area or given the address too? I told only the area, brother. That's why, they have come here in search of you. You eloped from the hometown and hiding here. For what sake, did you call him? Instead of this life, it's better to... Don't know who all will come, searching. Should I suffer because of you? Accompanied by a girl, He is saying to leave... Why are you afraid? If they don't find the person in a area, they won't come here again. Don't be afraid. I'll take care. Will you give me a tea? There is no milk. It's our house. I can have whenever I want. I'll come often. Hey! They won't come, hereafter. I'll take care. Be bold. Take care of her safe. Shall I leave? Bye. Brother, it seems he will take her. It'll not work, right? I've contact with all the colleges in Tamil Nadu. Yes. Whoever elopes with the girl, I'll get the call, first. Yes, that's routine. But, they will come and enjoy for two days and abandon the girl. - Then, I'll take over the girl. - Yes. - But, he is in deep love on this girl. - Is it? That's why, going beyond a week. He will leave. Malar. Get up. What? What? Are you surprised? I'll give you surprise every year, like this. This is a big surprise to me. My birth date is today but my birthday is on next month. Sister, please wait. - I'll go to ATM. - Okay, go. Dude, shall we have a tea? I'll buy you. Hey, come on. Master, two cups of strong tea. - Two cups of tea. She is very stingy. Why is she buying me tea? Let me see how long it goes. Dude, your shirt is excellent. I bought it four years ago and washed four days ago. You're the first woman to say that khaki shirt is looking excellent. You want to ask me something. Instead of going around, ask me straight away. Saying this and that... Dude, I saw Anbu at Saidapet sub- jail, a few times. The lawyer comes to the auto stand and takes money from him. What's his problem? I was dubious on you. You look after your job, don't poke unnecessarily in other things. If so, I'll bang you. Do you know how happily that family lived? You can't find a person like his father, wherever you search in this world. If anyone see the love in his family, they would feel jealous. Are you good? Mani, come on. Why have you come here? I went to your house, sister said you are here. That's why, I came here. Manickam, give the invitation to him. - Take it, brother-in-law. - Is it your daughter's wedding? Yes, come along with your family. You must come two days before. What are you doing, dude? - Okay, dude. - What, Mani? Names of kin isn't mentioned. They are staying away from the family for five years. Are they staying away or you kept them away, ...since they aren't rich? You've kept them away, that's the fact, right?

You didn’t agree to do, what I like. Are you okay, for today? Hey, go away. Always thinking of the same. Hey, Kathir! This is our first Diwali, post marriage, isn't it? Look here. This year, we don’t have money. Next year, let's celebrate grandeur. But, if you had married among your relatives... ...They would’ve given money and jewels to you, right? You too would’ve been happy. But, I wouldn’t have got my Malar. For me, Malar is my happiness. Shall I leave? - Hey, Kathir! - Brother. Come here. Brother, tell me. We’re leaving to our village. Have it. - Brother, why? - Have it. - I’ll be back in 4 to 5 days. - Brother, I don’t want. Hey, have it. Buy new attires. Don’t worry about anything and stay happy. Hey! Thank you, brother. Kathir, Happy Diwali. Brother, don’t make fun of me. Use my bike for going to work. Kathir, don’t drive fast, drive slowly. - Okay. - Hey! Don’t make fun of me. Take care. You enjoy.

Kathir! Kathir! Driver, better runaway. Someone call for an ambulance. Malar! Hey, move away. Give way. Kathir, nothing will happen to you. Kathir! Kathir! Doctor, Kathir! How is he now? Has any elders have come? Oh, no! I advised him. (Indistinct voices) He didn’t listen to what we said and left. You departed from us. Now, it cost him his death. Get the signature from her. - Okay, Doctor. Mam! Kathir! Sign in this form. How is Kathir, now? Tomorrow, the Chief Doctor will come and tell you. Transfer the patient of bed 3 to normal ward. - Doctor! Okay, sir. - Doctor, Kathir! - Yes. - Which patient is she asking about? - Kathir, an accident case, sir. You mean the accident patient, who’s skull got opened? Yes, doctor. Good improvement. Don't worry. But, he needs to be in ICU for observation. Maybe a week. He will be fine. Okay, don’t worry. Don’t worry. Doctor has said he will be fine. It’s been two days since you came here. Go home, refresh and come. - I’ll take care of him. - No, I’ll be here. It's night duty for me, I’ll take care. You go. Mam, Where is Malar house? - Sir, this house. - Arumugam! - Come and see here. - Sister, what happened? Mam! Any problem? The police has come. Who is Malar here? Come out. - Since the police has arrived, it must be big issue. - What, sir? - Mam. - Any problem? Sir! What happened? You come to the hospital. Sir! Hope nothing has happened to Kathir? Nothing. You come. Sister, come this side. Can you accompany me? (Mourning song) - (Mourning song) - Kathir! - (Mourning song) - Kathir! (Mourning song) - (Mourning song) - Don't allow her to leave, kill her. Hey! (Indistinct voices) Listen to me, be calm. Kathir! (Indistinct voices) They have brought Kathir. (Mourning voices) I brought you up with utmost affection. You left us all. Kathir! Look at your son. Our son left us. Kathir! Kathir! Leave me. I’m going. Kathir, I’ll also come with you. - Kathir! - Hey, you too come. My son-in-law is asking for a companion to die along. Leave me. Kathir! You leave from here or else they will beat you to death. Listen to me. Kathir! Kathir! Listen to me. Kathir! Hey, to have relationship with my son, you brought him here and killed him. I’ll witness you. You will be wandering with someone for the sake of money. I’ll witness you here itself. INTERMISSION Every year, I'll give you a surprise like this. Why did you bring her here? Is this necessary for us? She asked for a help and I sent you. Instead, you brought her again. We are struggling to lead our life. Do you want to get her along with us? She is pityful, dude. If you'd have seen the incidents happened there... ...you will not talk like this. Kathir's relatives would've beaten her to death. When looking her face, I reminded of Kathir. If I wouldn't have given bike and money to Kathir, He would've been alive, I think. I feel guilty that I'm also a reason for his death. I found her parent's contact number and called them. Her aunt attended the call. She said, she is not our daughter. We disown her and disconnected the call. How can I leave a girl, abandoned? That’s why, I brought her. Are you seeking remedy for your father's act? I think it's an unnecessary job, take care. Are you seeking remedy for your father's act? I'd have died. I'd have died when Kathir was hurt. There was a chance of life. I thought he will come alive for my sake. But he deceived me. I thought of seeing his face finally and die. But I couldn't. We both came to live happily. His father's words shouldn't come true. I must live. My Kathir is with me. I must live. I must live with his memories. This shouldn't happen to anyone, brother. At this young age... Yes. - Take the things, outside. - Okay, brother. Brother, what about the mat and pillow? It's a lucky mat. Take it carefully. Anand, take it carefully. Can't you take it safely? It slipped, brother. What are you going to do now, Maari? I got a call that the guy is dead and the girl was left alone. Oh, no! It was disheartening. Brother, move away. I've rented out the house to many people. But, such an incident has never happened. It's painful. Somehow, they are related to us. That's why... Switch off the TV. Why? Switch it off. Brother, it's we who brought them here. If anything happens to them, we will be questioned. We are responsible. Why is she like this? They will all come together. If they ask the guy is dead, what about the girl? So, we have to protect them. I've seen a house in Ramalinga nagar near to my house. I'll send her safely along with her parents when they come. Until then, who will take care of her other than me? What are you doing, brother? I'm playing cricket. Can't you see what I'm doing? Seems like you're playing a game with cowries. Reply to my query. I made her to stay here. My relative girl. Her husband is dead. Who else is here other than me? Who is related to whom? If you're a middleman, you should do only your job. Instead, you're vacating the house. Dude, it's my duty to protect that girl. Oh, we will take care of everything. Shut your trap and go. I'm replying patiently to your queries. Who are you to question me? If anything happens to her, who will answer? Uncle. Take your hand. Everyone is talking philosophy. As if they are perfect. Hey, granny! Won't you shut your mouth? - Uncle! - You always suppress me. You talk like a big cheese. Is that girl a relative to you? When you dragged her hand, she must have come if she is your relative. Did she come? Fraudster. What's this, dude? You're rocking! Do you think no one can ask you? I'll ask you. Do you think women are cheap? Will you go with him? Is he your relative? Tell me. I'm asking you. Will you go with him? Hey, you go away from here. Else, I might yell at you. This is the job I'm doing for many years. It seems, you're starting only now. Let me see, where and how will you help her to live? My clan is everywhere. I'll see to you later. House owner, yesterday two policemen came. Hereafter, guys will come and enjoy. This house will become a lodge. And both of you will go to prison for doing business with women. Then, these guys will be the middlemen for this business. Hey, whom do you call as middlemen? - Get lost. - Brother! - Hey! - Hey! - Henceforth, if I see you here... - Brother, come. Let's go. We got a customer from SRT college, Salem. The girl looks chubby. Anbu, we can't let this girl stay here at this stance. He'd have taken her. You denied that too. Anbu, I'm saying strictly. That girl shouldn't stay here. If you don't like what I say, better you too vacate the house. Don't mistake me, Anbu. Many families reside here. I don't know any other way, Anbu. I'll give you surprise every year, like this. You're a big surprise to me. You wander with someone for sake of money. Let's go straight to my sister's house. Let her stay there for four days. We will see later. Okay. Shankar, you left your wife and children in your hometown... ...and roaming with a girl here. Moreover, you want her to stay in my house. If your brother-in-law knows, he will kick me out of the house. I didn't expect Kamatchi to talk like this. Let's try for ladies hostel. - We have some rules, sir. Either there should be an ID proof or certificate. Else, we need a recommendation letter from the working place. Without these, no one will admit. We are going around with a girl in an auto at this odd time. I'm feared. Hey, the police is coming. Greetings, sir. Why are you here now? That's nothing, sir. Have to go till airport. The customer is coming. That's why, I'm waiting, sir. Why have you covered the auto? It's snowy, isn't it? That's why. Oh, you've covered the auto since it might shiver. We will leave now, sir. We ride the auto from this stand, sir. We will leave as soon as the customer arrives. Sir! - Senthil! - Sir! - You go to the station. - Okay, sir. Sir! Raji dear, I got a phone call from the IG office. Suddenly, I'm scheduled night shift. I'll come in the morning. Okay? Lock the door. Be careful. Sir, she isn't that kind of girl. Please, sir. Listen to me, sir. Is this Royal lodge? Inspector Paramasivam, speaking. Is Room no.143 available? Very lucky room. No, sir. Sir... Along with a girl. Clean it up. She isn't the kind of girl you think. Sir! No, sir. Listen to me, sir. Please, sir. Sir... Believe me, sir. She is pitiful, sir. Sir... Take the vehicle. Sir, I plead you... Hey, you... I told you to take the vehicle. - Hey! - Sir. Have you gone too far? No, sir. I'm nearby. - Come immediately. - To the same autostand? Raji, the programme was cancelled. I'm coming home. She seems to be a good girl. Take care. Take it, Anbu. You come this side. It's dawn. Sadha is not attending the call. If someone notice us, it'll be a shame. Sadha is coming. When he is coming? Coming too late and cool. You... Hey, do you've sense? How many times to call you? Can't you attend the call? Sorry, I kept the phone and was sloshed. The house is ready. Come, let's go. Dude, take the vehicle. Dude, follow me. Where are they rushing at this time? - Only their children have to study. - Our children should rear pigs. Still how long? The house owner is bit tough. I'll say whatever I wish. Don't care. Come. Come on. Uncle, this is the house. The rent is Rs.3000 - I finalized it for Rs.2500 - Excellent! Five months rent to be paid as an advance. We will pay. The middleman has to be paid Rs.2500 Isit? Dude, is it okay? Let's give. The middleman is my friend. I'll get you time. He will accept. - Okay. - I'll talk to him. - Dude, thank you very much. - It's okay, dude. You can't get this kind of house in this area. Okay. Sister! Sister! She looks like an alien made of airbag. - Is she the house owner? - She is the councillor. She will kick me out, If knew about me. - I need to piss. - Wait. - Greetings, sister! - Greetings, sister! Sadha, to whom is the house? The house is for them, sister. Don't look like that, sister. It's love marriage. It's been two months. He is with me in the auto stand. Good guy. He belongs to my hometown. You... Sister, that's nothing. He doesn't know to drive. He has no experience, that's why got hurt. Look here, dude. I'm very strict. I must get the rent by 10th of every month. Okay, sister. You must come home by 11 o'clock in the night. I'll lock the gate and take away the key. Then, you've to sleep outside. Similarly, if any noise emerge upstairs, I'll throw you along with all the things. - Is it okay? - Okay, sister. What a condition! Who is he? Dude, Introduce me. He is my uncle. My uncle, sister. Tell me your contact number. Why? To lift you if any problem arises. Sir, I'll stay back in auto. You come and pay for the ride. Hey, dude! Hey, blue shirt! Believe me, sister. Open the door. I told everything and brought them here. Get inside. I think, this place will be safe as of now. Many families stay here. You talk with the children. Move along, casually. If possible, try to forget everything. Call me immediately, whatever you need. I'm leaving. Leave this house, else you will be spared. Drunkard, how hard are you hitting me? I'll hit you like this if you don't give me money. Get lost by falling in pond or lake. Why should I die? You go and die. Hey, I'm telling you, right? Some people die but you aren't. Hey, what's the noise there? You go and die. Won't you suppress? - Sister, look at him. - Get in. I said get in. I'll be peaceful only if he dies. This has become routine for you. He is hitting me, everyday. Open the door. Hey, moustache! The onions are looking small. All onions will look small if it's in your hands. - Sister! - What? You told me to deliver the water can. I'm knocking the door for long time but no one is opening. Open the door. Sister, I'll keep the water can out, I'll come and take it in the evening. Dear, open the door. Open the door. I'm knocking the door. Open the door. I'm calling you. Eat. You... I said, eat it. Dude, on TV programme today, It's predicted for my sign that I'll be out of trouble. So, I'm going to be happy like a new born baby. - Hello! - Hey, fraudsters! Where are you all? How dare you cheat me? You should be here in ten minutes. Come on. 'The flowers are blossoming for my sake' Who is on the phone? The house owner. Her face is changing like an angry potato. Wonder, what will happen. Hey, you leave. Who is she to you? She is crying without eating. What's your story? Say something and manage her. Sister! Her aunt is dead. She thinks of her and crying. Sister! I'll tell you the truth. - What are you going to say? - Hey! We are different people. She is a lower caste girl. We fell in love when studying in college. My father didn't like it. He tried to blaze her in their home. Since we have no other way, we both eloped. It's okay if whatever happens to me. But, nothing should hurt her. So? Will you abandon her? No, sister. Still our clan is searching for us. If they see us together, they will lynch us. Does caste still matters? I too had an inter-caste marriage. Who is that generous person! Hey! Not that, I just tried to say that you've a generous mind. It's true. Who will come? No one can come here. I'll take care. Do you know who I am, right? Azaghu Rani.(Beautiful queen) The councillor of this town. You must stay here only. This is my fort. Let me see, who is coming here. Get inside. Go. Hey, why are you standing? You too get inside. Then, let me go. You stay back. I need to talk with you. Where are you driving the auto? At the stand. Which stand? At auto stand.

Without any movement, I was staring at her. She was blabbering in pain as, "mom". Applauds in theatre. It's enough of my acting. I'll go to my native. I'm going to live with my wife and children. I don't want this cinema. I don't want this cinema. I don't want this cinema. Dad! Dear, I think it'll be good if dad stays with you at this time. He takes care of me like a father. You go.

Just stop the routine of giving a month's rent for three months. Else, vacate the house. - I'll give on time, sister. - Go... Oh, no! My dear Malar! What will I do? Malar! What will I do, my dear? This has happened. I did a mistake. I've become the reason for your death. Anbu, I didn't expect your father would be a murderer. Just now Malar said, Anbu's father has come. I felt happy. Though Anbu married a lower caste girl, you've come to see her... ...when you knew she is pregnant. He stood like a dumb person when I was speaking. He kept everything in mind and killed her like this. A murderer! Malar! He had killed the mother and the child, together. Will he be forgiven? Hey! He takes care of me like a father. This is the safest place for you. What's this? Why did you do like this, father? Poor girl she is. Didn't your casteism obdurate yet? "Honour killings" often takes place in the villages... ...but this murder which happened in Chennai had caused a great chaos. The public at Aminjikarai is in a state of fear. Regarding this murder, at the spot of the incident... 'Caste will kill man!' 'Religion makes man a beast! - Thanthai Periyar.'
