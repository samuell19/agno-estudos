1940 - Kobe Raw Silk Inspection Center Come. No, stop fighting. On what charge? He's a raw silk buyer. He can explain at the HQ. He's a British merchant unrelated to politics. Taiji? It's been a while. You look surprisingly good in uniform. You've never seen it? No, but you're still you. Visiting Kobe? No. I was transferred to the Kobe Squad. - A squad leader's uniform? -Yes. That's amazing. I've been wanting to come, but have been too busy. You should visit our home in casual attire. I will, soon. It's near Mt. Rokko. I love mountains. I remember. My wife will be happy. How is Satoko? She's doing great. I'm glad. So... You know John Fitzgerald Drummond? A client and friend. He was arrested for leaking military secrets. I know. Fumio called. You're so calm. Panicked at first, but not anymore. Even if he's a British spy? - That's so... - Is it funny? That fat man. A spy? You trust him? He's a friend. Don't be ridiculous. You're too nice, Yusaku. Oh, am I? Times are changing. You must choose your friends. Give it a thought for Satoko too. I see... But it's my job to deal with foreigners. That's precisely why. If I close down, my wife will be homeless. I'm in uniform, but I dislike arresting people. But that's your job. Right. Then just do your job. Forgive my rude visit. Goodbye. Goodbye. Yuriko? Why? Cut. Satoko, one more time. Again? I've had enough. It hurts when Fumio grabs me. I'm sorry. But you fight back so hard, Auntie. So it's my fault? It means you're quite an actress, so let it go. I won’t hurt you this time. Let's trust Fumio. Please, just one more time. You two are ganging up. Just one more time. The safe code? I memorized it. Is everybody ready? I owe you. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. It's to protect my business, too. Yusaku paid the bail for me. Two hundred yen. Oh, that much? I can make up for it. It's ready. Thanks. Shall we? Was there... violence involved? It would be a lie if I said "no.” But it's nothing serious. They arrest him for being British but suck up to Italy and Germany. I will no longer be able to stay in Japan. You're going home? No, I'm going to Shanghai. The international settlement? How lovely. He's not going on vacation. I'm sorry. In Shanghai, I hear that there's some freedom left. Here. You two have been so good to me. What a marvelous gift. I can't sell it anyway. Take care. You too. Have a safe trip. I mistook you for being heartless. Why? For making a movie while your friend was in custody. Oh. You're always looking far ahead of me. I feel like a fool. You're not a fool at all. They're top quality. I'll make kimonos. No, Western clothes. But what about the National Uniform Edict? Screw that foolish order. Next month, I'm going to Manchuria for a month. To Manchuria? Everything's cheap. Iron ore, grain, even medicine. Dr. Nozaki wants some for research too. It's more dangerous than Shanghai. Nomonhan, right? I want to see the country before it's too late. Mark time, march. Squad, halt. Left, face. Dress right, dress. At ease. Salute to the Squad Leader. At ease. Rest. Rest. Look for suspicious individuals and inspect baggage. Fulfill your duties. Yes, sir. Attention. Left, face. Forward... Auntie, over here. I'm sorry I'm late. It's OK, we still have time. It's hot water. Thanks. Fumio, sorry you have to carry all that. I volunteered to go, so it's my job. Hey, cut it out. I'm sorry... Satoko, don't worry. From Busan, it's only one train ride away. He's going to film me as a Soviet spy. That's our gear. Really? Sounds like an epic film. Yup. All aboard! Uncle, shall we go? Off to "The Settler's Paradise." Yusaku. Here is fine. Be careful. See you. Prime Minister Konoe announced that on September 27, Japan, Germany, and Italy signed the Tripartite Pact. Hand-in-hand, they will shape the world order. To Mr. Fukuhara? To Manchuria? No, I'm writing to Yokohama. Oh, to his parents. Yes, Yusaku is their dear son and Fumio is their grandson. They're feeling anxious, so I want to comfort them. Madam, he'll be back in a week. Right, thank you. Madam. Yes? A telegram for you. Oh, from whom? Well, actually... To Satoko Fukuhara My return will be two weeks late. No need to worry. So these are mountain yams? It's delicious when grated. You found it with ease. I grew up in the mountains. Oh, hello. Hi. I didn't see you. Are you hiking? Yes, to get ice. Ice? There's natural ice up there. Really? I didn't know that. Mountain yams? Yes. - Have one. - No, I can't cook. You sure? Alright. My husband told me. Congratulations, Squad Leader Cut it out. You seem busy. Well... Why does a bachelor need ice? To drink whiskey. You? Whiskey? Don't laugh I'm not a kid anymore? Yes, neither am I. I know... Come drink whiskey at my place. It's top quality. Okay then. I'll visit later. I'll bring ice. Thank you. See you later. Here. This ice is smooth unlike ordinary ice. I wouldn't have come in Yusaku's absence. That's why I didn't tell you. You're not drinking? Satoko, do you enjoy it here? It's lonely without him. Meaning? What? There's no hidden meaning. Yes, you have always been like that. I have. I'm glad you're happy. Just a word of advice from a childhood friend. What is it? You all wear Western clothes. You don't like it? Foreign whiskey. Not domestic ones. I don't mind, but it's Yusaku's choice. Taiji, drink it and tell me what you think. People are going to have opinions. What's normal to you may be offensive to others. We live in such times. I appreciate your concern. I'm sorry. To me, you're still a 14-year-old teenager. Please remember me that way. Come on, try some. Hey, let me go now. No, I won't. This may be a fleeting love but it still gives me joy In this bleak world we ride the boat of our dreams But soon sinks deep below waves of daylight I can't help but shed a cascade of tears Such fleeting love You and I, just a momentary couple Make believe that our hearts are calm But burning like a fire deep inside Planting a phantom kiss in the real world My whole body is overwhelmed with sadness This painful love is a one-way road Okay, that's all folks. Thanks for helping. Listen up. This year, we experienced a company crisis, yet again. But thanks to you, we managed to survive. In appreciation, I brought rice cakes and sugar. Add them to your New Year's ration. Thank you for your hard work. Let's make a toast. Cheers! - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate it. Thank you. Gentlemen. I have an announcement. I know this is sudden, but I'm leaving this firm. Instead, I'm going to write a novel. I witnessed war on the mainland. Before I'm drafted, I want to write a piece for future generations. I'll retreat to Tachibana Inn in Arima, to write my first novel. Please visit me when you're nearby. Let's have some tea. About Fumio. Why didn't you tell me? He told me not to, because you'd probably stop him. Fumio seems… to have changed. His adventurous spirit got fired up... in Manchuria. Adventure? What kind? Satoko, I may go to America. Why? You know about their export restriction? No, I don't. I see. We're going to be enemies? Soon. So now's my chance. But why America? I want to see it one more time. At 20, I went to the west coast as a sailor. San Francisco and Los Angeles. Want to see a vast landscape? Yes, I do. Don't forget... New York. Skyscrapers. I can't die without seeing them. Oh Yusaku, be careful. It's never this empty. Meaning we can do anything. Oh dear, you're drunk. Yeah, so what? Come. Here? Button your lips. I can't reach. From Mr. Drummond? Hey. Yes, it is. Is it important? No, it's nothing. I'm a little worried. About what? He's from... an enemy country. He's a businessman, not an enemy. She's beautiful. Sorry to summon you. Do you know her? No. What about Tachibana? The inn in Arima? We go every summer, but my nephew-in-law… Fumio is staying there. Yes. The inn's female staff, Hiroko Kusakabe, was murdered. That's her photo. What? She moved to Manchuria and grew close to an army physician, but returned to Japan last month. Did you know that? No, I didn't. You think I did it? No, please forgive me. It's my job. I don't like you in that uniform. That's too bad. The person who brought Hiroko back to Japan is Yusaku. What? He found her a job as a staff at Tachibana Inn. Don't worry. Our investigation shows that Yusaku is innocent. But what about Fumio Takeshita? They were living under the same roof. You think Fumio killed her? Relationships can get nasty. So far, we don't know where this case is headed. I called you here to tell you to be prepared. Prepared for what? The demeanor and actions of you and your husband. We'll be watching. Tell me. How was the movie? Mizoguchi's new film must be a masterpiece. What's wrong with you? I have a question. Have you been to Tachibana Inn? What the heck? Taiji summoned me today. I lied about the movie. Taiji, eh? Behind my... Answer me. I didn't go to the inn. Satisfied? How about... Hiroko Kusakabe? She passed away. I know. But it doesn't concern you. Why not? Making you worry goes against my beliefs. Then you have failed. I knew it. You do know her. We got acquainted over there. That's it. Taiji said that you and Fumio brought her back here. Please. Tell me the truth. Never during our marriage have I felt like I don't know you. Don't ask. I beg you. I knew it. I haven't done anything shameful. I'm not made to lie to you, so I'll be silent. That's the same. Don't ask, because I'll have to answer. You know me. Do you trust me or not? You're being unfair. I trust you. Thank you. I do trust you. End of conversation. Understood? Where did you... get this ice? Taiji has a crush on you. That's why he came to Kobe. You're so good at pretending not to notice. While I... I'm not made to lie to you. Look at you, Yusaku. You're a genius at lying. Am I? Hello. My my, Mrs. Fukuhara. - Welcome. - Hello. What brings you here today? My husband has a message for Fumio. Oh, I see. Fumio has changed beyond recognition. I was surprised because he's not like he used to be. These past two months... Yes? You've been good to my husband. Don't mention it. Welcome. Have a seat. Tell me the truth. About what? Did you kill Hiroko Kusakabe? That's absurd. Why did you bring her here? Out of pity. We couldn't walk away. Who? Who couldn't walk away? You or my husband? Well well. Suspecting your husband? I don't suspect him. All I want... is the truth. The truth... Brainwashed by the military. You fool. What? You're a fool. Call me what you want, but… If you're putting my husband in harm's way, I must ask you to stop. Stop? How? I knew it. You two are involved in something risky. Auntie. Have you ever tried to understand Uncle and how he really feels? About what? You don't have a clue. The hardships he has faced so that you could live in peace. I have no idea... Exactly! You didn't see it. You'll never understand! Tell me what I didn't see. Forgive me. Perhaps in ignorance, there's a glimmer of hope. Please take this. What? Keep it sealed. It's for Uncle's eyes only. What is it? The military is watching me. I can't leave this inn. The translation is done. Tell that to Uncle. That's your message? Yes. You should leave. Take care. Tachibana Inn I'll buy double of Nishijin fabric. So would you please lower the cost price? Alright. How's 25 percent? Goodbye, Boss. - Goodnight. -See you. What is it? Fumio wants you to know that the translation is done. How can I trust you if I don't know anything? Please tell me. Where do I begin? From the start. From Busan, we took the train and headed to Manchuria. The capital was bustling. I felt a type of hope that I can't feel in Japan anymore. We received permission to visit Kwantung Army's research lab. I wanted to procure medicine. We occasionally saw mounds from the car. First, I thought they were disposed farm crops. Up close, I could see many hands and feet sticking out. Smoke was coming out. Corpses were being burned. Corpses of plague victims. We ended up saving one woman's life. Yes, Hiroko Kusakabe. A nurse and the military doctor's lover. She told us the plague epidemic was caused by the Kwantung Army's biological weapon. The Army released the bacteria and secretly experimented on humans. The doctor was killed trying to disclose it. Hiroko was in danger. The doctor had entrusted her with hard evidence. Experiment notes. Fumio gave you that and the English translation. How they spread the plague and extensive details on experimenting with captives. They cannot get away with this. So... What is the translation for? To impeach them in international politics. It will trigger the passive U.S. to enter the war against Japan. And then what? - We'll lose. - Will we? Japan will lose. That... That will make you a traitor. I'm a cosmopolitan. A what? My allegiance is not to a country but to universal justice. I won't tolerate injustice. You're “justice” will kill thousands of fellow citizens. I will be insulted as the wife of a spy. Is that your justice? What about our happiness? Happiness built upon injustice? I'll still choose happiness. Don't act like you know. You didn't see what I saw. I don't want you to. But it's happening. Our “fellow citizens” are conducting heinous acts in a faraway country. I saw it. If I was chosen by fate, I must do something about it. You're a different person. This is the real me. No, I know what's going on. That woman changed you. She took over your heart and mind. You're right. I didn't see anything. So what? International politics? Chosen by fate? Do you think I care? That is... the truth. I'm visiting Dr. Nozaki. Yes, sir. Tell Satoko that I may stay overnight. Understood, sir. Have a safe trip. Is he gone? Yes, madam. He's going to stay overnight. I see. Madam, Mr. Fukuhara isn't here. I know. He left something behind. Is that so? It's fine, I know where it is. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit? Actually... There's something I need to tell you. We arrested Hiroko Kusakabe's killer. What? It was the inn's owner. No... He hired her, developed amorous feelings, and raped her. She resisted, so he killed and dumped her in the sea. How pitiful. I made you worry for no reason. I apologize. It's fine. One more thing. I think you should know. Yusaku arranged to have Hiroko study in the U.S. as a nurse and applied for passports. For her and himself. Did you know? No, I didn't. It's alright to go to the U.S. for business, but at a time like this? And taking Hiroko Kusakabe along. I'm... I'm just worried about you. Are you done? Well then. I'll cut to the chase. I was reluctant since it's family-related. What's that? Just take a look. Autopsy results Experimental subject No. 171 Injection: 0.1 mg of plague bacterium Body injuries of Black Death What is this? It was brought from Manchuria. By whom? Hey, Yamauchi. Where are the financial reports for Europe? They're not here. They're probably in storage. It's fine, I'll go. Thank you, sir. No problem. Mr. Yusaku Fukuhara, please come with us. What for? We arrested Fumio Takeshita. We'd like to question you as witness. I see. Yusaku Fukuhara, are you a spy for the Allies? No. - How about Fumio Takeshita? - No. How can you be sure? Because he's not. I trust the man Fumio is. Pure and simple. But Fumio Takeshita admitted to being a spy. Really? An item related to an important state secret was included in his luggage from Manchuria. Do you know what? No.. After long hours of interrogation, he confessed. He said he acquired the items while traveling with Hiroko Kusakabe. He said he did everything himself and you weren't involved. I have no choice but to believe that. There's no other evidence. Do you believe a forced confession? No. Then why? There was a report. Report? By whom? We were able to secure the state secret thanks to a good civilian. Your hand. Who reported it? Someone you know very well. I don't want that person to be unhappy. It's not too late. Mend your ways and work for your country. That's the end of this. You snitch. You're also a thief. You sold both of us out to a childhood friend. How dare you look so calm? I knew Fumio would protect you. I counted on it. Look at these. Fumio's nails. Hard choices must be made to achieve great deeds. You sent Fumio to hell. A sacrifice for a greater cause. Fumio understands. If not, you wouldn't be here. Without the notebooks, it's a lost cause. There were two notebooks. This is the one you need. With the witness Hiroko dead, we need the original. I understand your anger. But even so, you have to trust me. I'm the only one you have left. Did you see it? Yes, I did. The door too. You have the original on film. This is what you saw in Manchuria. Yes. Solid evidence. It's so cruel. The Kwantung Army filmed their tests on humans. Hiroko obtained a copy for a ticket home. With this film and translation, you can achieve your goal. Let's go to America. The two of us. This is my hiding place in case of a crisis. Yusaku. This isn't the only film, is it? Huh? That film alone isn't worth the risk of bringing back a woman. You're quite a woman. You have something solid to influence public opinion. Exactly. The original is clearer, detailed and is half an hour long. I trusted it to Drummond in Shanghai. Mr. Drummond? It was safer than taking it home. That was a mistake. Drummond asked for a large sum of money in return for the film. Poverty dulls the wit. Wait a moment. Could he be a real spy? If so, he's on your side. I'm not a spy. I'm acting of my own will. I'm not a spy. It doesn't matter. For me, you're just you. If you're a spy, I'll be the wife of a spy. It's simple. If fate in Manchuria chose you, it chose me too. Japan News Saigon July 26, 1941. After agreement on the joint defense of French Indochina army and navy reinforcements were sent to Indochina. Col. Mabuchi announced. The South China Sea was calm. Our giant fleet for the important mission of peace in French Indochina showed its magnificence at Cap Saint-Jacques at nine. Our brave Imperial citizens resisting Ally forces in Indochina must have been happy to be reunited. Nikkatsu Uzumasa Talkie Priest of Darkness Script by Shintaro Mimura Directed by Sadao Yamanaka The U.S. has finally imposed an oil embargo on Japan. Oh. The ABCD Line is complete. I have no legal way to go to America. Were you planning to go to America with that woman, Hiroko? Of course not. I applied for the visa so as not to raise suspicion. She was meant to go alone. Well... If Fumio had asked, I would have let him go. Is that true? Of course. Then, I'd have to be the one to go with you. Yeah, but how? There's only one way. Defection. Payment to Drummond and two fake passports from Shanghai. Plus other expenses, we need… At least ten thousand yen. Ten thousand? But how? Japanese yen will be useless. Let's change cash at the firm into metals. Okay. Our trip will probably be about two weeks to San Francisco, hiding inside crates. Two weeks... Don't worry. I'll arrange for help. Meals, water and even the bathroom. Alright. How will you receive the film from Mr. Drummond in Shanghai? I have a proposal concerning that. Well go separately. You and me? Yes. You'll go on a freight ship with the film. I'll buy the original from Drummond, then go to America. We'll meet in San Francisco, hire help, and head to Washington together. No. Hey… I'll go with you. I want to disperse risk. A freighter is safe. I can't go alone. Who will protect me in a freight box? I'll arrange for it. I know the captain. I can't trust that. You have to trust someone. There're only the two of us to do this task. I'm scared. Please be strong. It's only a short while. For our cause, we should be able to bear this. I'm not afraid of capture or death. I'm only afraid of being separated from you. My only wish is to be with you. Being physically apart does not mean the souls are apart. I feel a stronger bond than ever with Fumio in jail. It's Fumio's will that drives me on. It’s possible to have a stronger bond by being apart. We'll have that deeper love. Don't worry. Well be together soon. We must. When we meet again in America, we'll have all the evidence. Meeting again means achieving our goal. We must succeed. Alright. Good. Well start preparations tomorrow. First, we'll buy jewelry. Any request? I don't know. Shall we pretend it's an anniversary to justify the shopping spree? This is Dr. Nozaki's car. Great, isn’t it? Oh, it's like a dream. It feels great. Be careful. How's this? It looks good on you. Choose one. How much? Two hundred. Great husband. Even for an anniversary, recently it's rare. What's that? This one? It's pearl. This will suit you too. Oh, I can't decide. Then, take both. You can wrap it around your wrist. Here's 400 yen. Thank you. It's made in America. It's waterproof for the navy. I have no plans to go to the sea. Not bad. Can I try this? Of course. Ah, Swiss... Nice. Show us some for women. Sure. It makes me feel like a businesswoman. Okay. I'll take them all. All? Oh, thank you very much. Remember these? We can't take them. Let's sell them. It's ironic to use them to pay for the film. Good idea. What's wrong? That's the man we saw from the car. Don’t look. Are we being followed? I'm not sure. Let's split up. You go first. I'll stay and check if anyone is following you. Okay. If the coast is clear, take a taxi home. Yes. Yusaku. What happened? Oh, good. Didn't you go home? I watched the pawnshop. There was nobody suspicious. I looked away for just a moment and you walked so quickly away. Oh, gosh. You think it's funny? It's silly? But you can never be too careful. Stay here. What's wrong? Do you feel sick? No. I'm happy. I finally feel I'm living with you. Outside the pawn shop, I thought I was your eyes. Then, I felt really happy. Satoko. You're not the wife of a spy. So, there's no need to live in hiding. Many others share our beliefs. We'll find allies. Madam. Yes? Are you going somewhere far away? No. It's just a two-week trip. I will keep the house ready for your return. You can rest assured. Two weeks or three. Even until the end of the war. Thank you. Done. I'll go with you. No. You to the port and I to the station. Do as planned. Yes. Remember. Samuel is the captain but a big man called Bob will help you. Look for a huge man standing near the ship. When will I see you? Soon. Don't worry. In two weeks. Yes. That's a promise. You're in charge here. Yes, sir. I wish you two a good trip. Thank you. Safe trip, madam. Thank you, Komako. Enjoy your trip. I'll get off here. The third pier. Yes, sir. Satoko? Bob? Search all the cabins and crates. There's a stowaway. Look everywhere. Satoko Fukuhara. Leaking information, treason, aiding enemies. Any of these charges deserve the death penalty. But we don't believe you were alone in this. Where's Yusaku Fukuhara? He's the real traitor. If you tell us, your sentence will be reduced. I don't know. Let me ask one thing. How did you find out about that ship? We received a tip. A tip... There was an anonymous letter. About a stowaway on a ship from Kobe to San Francisco. We thought it would be Yusaku Fukuhara on the ship. I didn't expect you. I have an ambition too. I'm no longer a child. Impeach the Kwantung Army? Yes. Why do you trust a document forged by a traitor? Just watch the film. Fine. Let's have a look and see what your ambition is. Taiji. You've always been a gentle person. We climbed mountains and even had whiskey together recently. Kindness is your true nature. I know that. And now, you have great power. If the times have changed you, couldn't you have changed the times? You're a traitor too. You deserve to die. It's ready, sir. It's ready. Let's watch it. Everyone look. The horrible deeds being done. This may be a fleeting love but it still gives me joy In this bleak world we ride the boat of our dreams But soon sinks deep below waves of daylight I can't help but shed a cascade of tears Such fleeting love You and I just a momentary couple Make believe that our hearts are calm But burning like a fire deep inside What is this? Why did you try to smuggle this thing overseas? Planting a phantom kiss in the real world My whole body is overwhelmed with sadness Bravo! This painful love is a one-way road March 1945 Tokyo is in flames. It's not just Tokyo. Nagoya, Osaka... Kobe will be bombed soon. All the men are dead. Us women can't do anything. It's the end for Japan. Why do you look so cool? Say something. Leave her alone. She's really sick up here. Number 284. Yes. A visitor. Oh. It's been a while. Why are you here, Dr. Nozaki? Well... Nurse, can you wait outside? Yes, sir. Let's sit down. Well, your doctor is a friend of mine from the Imperial University. That's how I found out that you were hospitalized. And I was able to force my way in. I didn't expect to see you. Yes. Well... really... It must've been hard. How are you? Silly question. No, it's alright. I'm fine. You actually look good. My head is clear if I avoid the pills. I see. Doctor, please tell me what it's like outside. We only get papers that are censored. The outside world is more or less the same. My husband... Do you know anything? A friend saw him in Bombay, India. Bombay? Yes. Then, I heard about an American passenger ship from Bombay to L.A. It was sunk by a Japanese submarine, according to reports. But you know, information cannot be trusted nowadays. Are you alright? Yes Is that all? That's all I know. I see You've spent a long and hard time here. I'll make arrangements to get you out somehow. Why? I can't bear to see you in such a place. I'll take care of you at my humble home. Thank you. But that's not necessary. It's fine. It just seems to be fitting. What do you mean? I'll confide in you that I'm not crazy at all. Yes. However... That's the very fact that makes me the crazy one in this country. Open the door. Open the door. Open up. Air raid. Run for your lives. Hurry. It's an air raid. Hurry up. Air raid. Run. Air raid. Get out, quickly. Hurry up. Come on. This way. Now, Japan will lose. The war will end. Bravo. End of war August 1945 The following year, Yusaku Fukuhara was confirmed dead. There were traces of forgery on the death certificate.
