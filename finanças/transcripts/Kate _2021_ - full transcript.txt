You sure you don't wanna use the variable scope for this? No. I've got a lock on vector and trajectory. You ever hear that saying, "Listen to your elders"? Big phrase, especially here in Japan. So you're an elder now? "Elder" doesn't necessarily mean old. It just means older. As in smarter, wiser. But hey, I'm serious. We blow this chance, it's seven years... Seven years of hard work down the drain. Ah, so you do listen to me. V… I haven't missed once in 12 years. Not gonna miss. All right. Let's dance. Oh, one last thing. See? And you say I only think about the work. Hi, uh… No. Well, never mind, then. Here, catch! Seasonal, single male mark. Copy. Holding at yellow. Target visible. Seasonal, the window is open. You're green. I've got a protocol breach. I repeat, you are green. Code five on-site. Code five. Overridden. Take the shot. Hold on. There's a kid here. The window is closing. I repeat, take the shot, Seasonal. Please reconfirm. I repeat, take the shot. Seasonal, the window is closing. I've thought about this a long time. I wanna talk retirement. What happened in Osaka shouldn't have. It was wrong. Nobody knew she'd be there. We had one rule, V. One simple rule. No kids. I know. I mean, this ain't your first rodeo. You know there's collateral damage. You know that. I can't shake it. Trust me, I've tried. Almost to the head of the snake. Look, I promised I'd finish the job, and I will. And then I'm out. I want a life, V. You know, I never had one. A real, regular life. What does that mean? I mean, what… Family? Kids? - Picket fence? Dogs? Suburbs? - I don't know. Something like that. Two trips to Walmart, you'll be back. It must be killing you. You haven't even touched your Merlot. It's Margaux. I'm sorry, that was a total pick-up line. Fuck it. I mean, listen. The worst way to start a conversation is a "Hey." It's boring, it's dull. It's for horses. So anything but that. I'm Stephen. Hey. Shibuya-ku Sendagaya 4-7-11. Shibuya-ku Sendagaya 4-7-11. Time to leave. Seasonal, on-site. Copy. Stage mark. Northwest corner. Sector and trajectory? Main entrance, two black sedans. Single. Contact. Primary win… Seasonal, repeat. Window on primary? Ten seconds, max. Seasonal, report. Holding on yellow. Target visible. You are green. Window is closed. Seasonal, report. - New point. - Negative. You are red. - New point. - The window is closed. Hey. Stop, stop. For fuck's sake. Now you start the rest of your life - What's your name? - Kate. Kate. I'm Varrick. I'm your handler now. That makes me your mother, your father, your best friend, and your therapist. Left. That all you got? Left. Good. It's good. You're awake. You've been out almost a day. Have you had any recent exposure to radioactive materials? No. The reason I ask is you appear to be suffering from accelerated ARS. Acute radiation syndrome. Lethal. Caused by subjection to potent radiation in… Extremely short amount of time. Which substance? We looked for the usuals. Iodine-131, thallium, but uh… It appears to be more specific. Polonium-210? 204. We'll take the Margaux to go. Please do not try to… How much time do I have? A day, maybe. But we will make it painless for you. Shit. It's possible that... I'll get a nurse. Five liters of blood in the body, heart pumps two a minute. Gun's on your femoral. You do the math. I need something to keep me going. I want stimulants. These. Load them in the shots, go. Give me five. - Come on. - Okay. I don't have all the time in the world. What are you trying to do? Shibuya-ku Sendagaya. Shibuya-ku Sendagaya. - …take a shower. - We should just have fun! - It's the last night. Come on! - I know. But I still have stuff to do. Oh, my God! Why'd you poison me? What are you talking about? Poison? I didn't know it was… They told me it was just a roofie, so they could lift the room. Who? Who told you? Even if I knew, I'd be dead if I tell you. - Aw, she'll be dead if you don't. - Wait. Don't. Sato. Kazuo Sato. He manages a Yakuza club. Which clan? Kijima. Fuck, it's a Kijima clan. They've owned us for years. Sato said that if he did this one last thing, that he would set us free. We could actually start over now. A different life. Please. These might fit you. Can I get you something? Anything? Boom Boom Lemon? You got any? Oh, um… No, sorry. I'm Kanako. And it seems we're the same. Collateral damage. I'm Kate. And they're gonna know I was here. Who? Everyone. Poisoned by who? That's what I'm trying to figure out. There must be some antidote. For polonium-204? Who was the mark, V? Kate, you know, uh… V? Who was the mark? You won't get any more questions from me after today. A man named Kijima. I recognized him from Osaka. Who is he? Grand honcho of the biggest family in Tokyo. Your mark in Osaka was Kijima's younger brother, Kentaro. I won't lie, it's been a shitshow for us as it's been for you, and… Kijima, apparently, who hasn't been able to let it go. This was revenge for Osaka? Some people have this extraordinary attachment to their siblings, as if genetics make a family and… Anyway, all that honor shit, Kijima's been on a tear against the… How do I get to him? Kijima doesn't surface. Not after Osaka. Last night was a very rare opportunity. What about Sato? Kazuo Sato. Ring a bell? I know that some of his guys hang out at a place called the Black Lizard. That's a start. Go. You Sato? Kazuo Sato? Who are you? What... Did you poison me? You don't tell me, I kill you. I think you're lying, I kill you. Did you poison me? Yeah. Why? Hey! Why'd you poison me? I only follow orders. From Kijima? Please. Where is Kijima? How do I get to him? Nobody knows. All right. Same question, same deal. - You killed him! He is the... - He is dead. You worry about you. You crazy! I don't know! I'm gonna ask one more time. Where is Kijima? Last chance. Please. I don't know... Shit! Ani. Ani-chan would know. Ani? Hey, stop! What the fuck are you doing? Let go of me! Hey! Stop! Come on. Ow! - Get up. - Kuso! You slapped me! Stop, or I'll… Fuck. Okay, okay, okay. Next one goes in there. I'm sorry. You're gonna call Kijima for me. What? Kijima. Call him. I can't. I don't have his number. Oh, you don't have his number? Really? Kijima, yeah, I don't have his number! - How do you reach him? - Okay, who are you? How do you get in touch with him? I don't know, I just call ano baka Renji. Renji? The only person that talks to him. Okay. Call Renji. Hai, Shinzo. Ani? I got the kid. If Kijima wants to see her again, he can meet me at the center of Murakawa marketplace in one hour. - A second more and she dies. - Who is this? You're crazy. You wanna get Kijima? You think you can… You can't get to him this way. He doesn't give a shit about me. No one does. Come on. Huh? And you know, for your information, I haven't talked or seen my uncle in, like, a year. Shit. Ew, what the fuck? Oh, my God, what is wrong with you? Sit down. I said, sit down! Yeah, no way. You're all gross and sick. And you know what? Fuck you, cancer bitch. Hey, I have to go to the bathroom. Me, too. Come on. Ouch. Hey. You got any Boom Boom Lemon? Well, this sucks. Ugh! I can barely breathe in here. No way. So many scars and blood. It's so… It's gross, I know. No, no, no. I think it's awesome. Ow! What the fuck are you doing, bitch? This will keep you safe. Trust me. Hai. - Dozo. - Arrigato. Where is Ani-chan? I don't see Kijima. Let me see the child first. Either Kijima walks out right now, or I leave and you never see the kid alive again. Boo! Stupid shit! Ani. Shinzo. Oh, my God. - You better get out of here. - Wait! Hey. Hey. Where are we going? Stop following me. Stop. You're just gonna leave me, then? Kijima didn't show. You're useless to me now. Did you see what just happened? My own family wants me gone. Where the fuck will I go? Not my problem. I'll be dead before the night's over. Hey, that makes two of us. Why did you save me, then, huh? You're making me regret it! You… you're a… No! You can't abandon me. I know Kijima killed my dad, and he will kill me. What did I do wrong, huh? I haven't done anything to anybody, but they still treat me like shit! Everybody, all the time, just throwing me around, like I'm some piece of garbage. Shut up! You don't know what you're talking about. You just yap, yap, yap. Just "fuck this, fuck that." You don't know anything! You're a kid! Medicine. Dropped it. What's wrong with you? I'm dying. Kijima did this, right? Are you gonna go kill him? You're a badass killer motherfucker. You'll need me, you know. Like… Just look at you. You… You won't make it an hour without my help, okay? And I can do everything, okay? I know who, where, when, whatever. - I can help you get him, get my uncle. - Okay. And I'm really good at shortcuts and maps and… What? I said okay. Okay. Um… You can't walk around like this. Sold out. Boom Boom Lemon? Artificial shit. You know what? This is stupid. Let's go. Yeah, clean clothes are stupid. "Everything I should wear should be just covered in blood." Aw, it's so cute on you. Come on. You're so cool. But you're also a Terminator, bitch. - Oh, my God. - "I die." Seriously, we're… We're actually pretty much the same. It's scary. Who has a line into Kijima? Only Renji. I told you. His main advisor. That was my dad's job. But he got shot. Kijima did it, I'm sure. And Renji was there, too. How do I find Renji? Um, probably with his aijin. His what? His boyfriend, Jojima. - Tell me where. - Mmm. It's this fucking cool penthouse, top of the tower. - The entire floor is theirs. - Security? I mean, two in the lobby, at least. - Service entrance? - Yeah. The back, by the kitchen. We could just shoot our ways in. And risk Renji escaping? No. I have to get to him before he knows what's wrong. - We'll be fast, okay? Bang, bang! Brrap! - "You're dead..." Stop. Speak less, open your ears. We're gonna distract them. You're going to distract them. How? By being you. Just, you know, louder. Okay, cool. So… Can I have a gun? No. Ani-chan? Where's Renji? What do you want from Renji-san? It's not your concern. Of course it is my concern. Your concern is to stay whole until I leave here. Renji? You may do to me what you must. But I will not be disclosing his whereabouts. Shut the blinds. Shit, there's one remote for everything. Shit, shit. Stop, Jojima! Back off! Konoyaro! Stop it! You motherfucker! Stop it! Fuck. I'm sorry. Fuck. There's blood on my… There's blood… There's blood on my face. There's blood. Hey. Hey, hey. Come on. Come here. - No. No, stop it. Stop it! Stop! - Hey. Look at me. Look only at me, okay? Look only at me and breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Okay? You're gonna live through this. Okay? All right? You're doing great. Okay? Come here. Come here. Hey, maybe we should check this house, huh? Maybe there's some, uh… - Clues? - Clues. Yeah. Bingo. - Hey, I think I know where Renji is. - Yeah? Check this out. Cellular tracking. I can see exactly where Renji is and where he will be. That's very good. "Useless." Ani? Bang! Bang! Hey, Renji. I gotta be honest, I'm having a rough night. I really need to see your boss Kijima. Speak English, motherfucker. English, I said. Wakatta. Wakatta. Fuzakenna. Family killed my father. Family tried to kill me. All of you asshole hyenas getting fat off of my dad's carcass! Look. Just give him to me, and you'll live. Okay? I do not know. When he disappears like this, he says, "To be amongst family." I don't know what it means. I know where he is. Your phone. I found him. I found Kijima. I'm gonna finish it, V. Hey, I promised you, didn't I? Kate, tell me where you are, I'll come to you right now. Let me help you. Don't. I'll already be dead anyway. You can find my body near a house in Hottazaka. In the hills. Goodbye, V. Kate? Does that hurt? When you do that. No more questions. I don't know anything about you. Don't need to. Do you wanna know about me? I know enough. But I'm the last person you'll get to know. You don't wanna know me? That's sad, Kate. I think that's really… It's sad. My mom's a gaijin, too. That's why I've never met her. Never even seen a picture. They won't… I… I don't know what she looks like. She was like you, I bet. Tall and… pretty. No shit from no dudes. Just doing what she wants all the time. Total killer babe. Killer babe. It's the old family house. No one really knows about it. Where they all grew up. The elders and shit. My dad, too. Go on. I'll finish this. What? You'll finish it? Hey, look at you. You can't stand, and you can't see. Okay? You're gonna die. Yeah, after I kill him. - I'm here now. I'm coming with you. - No, you're not. Why not? I go where you go. Because you're a fucking kid. Go be one. I never could. Hey, Ani… You're young. You have time to forget. Be someone less angry. Take control of your own life. Go. Look at me. Yeah. I'm dying. Kentaro, your brother… Renji. Hi. Get lost. Yeah. You know, I thought I had the coolest bracelets. I realize now, you have the coolest bracelet. I have a gun, you know. Well, good for you. Your parents raised you right. Yeah, you don't know shit about my parents, so just fuck off. Well, I know it couldn't have been easy to lose 'em. You know, I lost someone that I love a lot. And you know her. Kate? Maybe my best friend. And, uh… I'm very worried about her. "Friends." I didn't know Kate had any stupid friends. Well, she's got you, doesn't she? But you're right. She and I aren't really friends, more family. No, but Varrick, he's… he's… Have you ever wondered about Kate's obsession with your family? You mean my uncle? Yeah, sure. Him, too. Sorry. I know you've been through a lot. What do you mean? Kate ever share with you what she did in Osaka when she first met you? I have to finish this. I'm dying. I have to finish… I have to finish something. Death is the time for the beginnings. No, no, no. No, Ani. Ani, no… You lied to me! I killed someone for you. - Ani... - You killed my whole family. You… You bitch! No, please. Shoot me if you want, but don't get in that car, okay? Look at me. I'm begging you. You're stronger than I am. You don't have to end up here... Shut the fuck up! I have nothing left, okay? It's what they do. You and me, we're collateral... Now what? Now… You start the rest of your life. You start the rest of your life. I know how much you must be hurting right now, losing your parents. But it's gonna be okay. I repeat, take the shot. The gun was empty. It's empty! I know. Shoot 'em in the stomach, they die slow, in agony. And they know it's personal. Let's go. Breathe. Breathe. Are you gonna let that pain overwhelm you? Control you? This is so cool. Maybe you can embrace it. And let it empower you. Renji? What is she doing here? She's the future. Mine at least. Ani, sit. You went after my girl without my permission. I could fucking kill you right now. And destroy your own operation? My issue is not with my operation. It's with you taking it on yourself. You ordered her termination. "If she's leaving, I will terminate her." Your words exactly. "If." I said "if." Key word, "if." She was coming back. I just had to work it. I was working it. She would have changed her mind. I would have changed my mind. Polonium-204? Fuck you! Your girl had to die. That was always the deal, Varrick-san. After Kentaro's death, all eyes were on me. I panicked. I moved too quickly, and I'm sorry. Yeah. You know what? You blundered, I blundered. Let's, uh… Maybe we do our best to put this behind us. In the name of being human. I prefer self-interest. I trust it more. I can't say I can trust you going forward. Trust was not a part of the deal. Neither is friendship. Welcome to the Yakuza, Varrick-san. Not tonight. Boom Boom Lemon? Let's go get Ani. Alpha-six, camera two is down. I repeat, camera two is down. Four to Alpha-six. So what do we do? Well, we, uh, call up the teams, form a barricade around the crystal box. Bring up the kid. And, uh, you know, we'll hole up in there. Move! Which teams, sir? All of 'em! Go, go, go! Uh-oh. Asshole. - Bring up the girl. - Copy that. Let's go. Move! Hey! Easy, cowboy. Fuck! Okay, Renji. You ain't coming with. You take care of Kijima. You guys, stay with him. You guys, come with me. Good luck. Eh? Eh? Bravo, Kate. Never doubted you. Ani… I'm sor... Ani, I'm sorry. I'd do anything… To undo it, to take it all back. Can't go back, sadly. Please. Be nice, right now, for both of us, wouldn't it? Ani, I'd give anything to take it back. I'd take it all back. I'm so sorry. But guess we gotta just accept who we are now. And you know, Kate, that we are… Tools. Well, I was gonna say "indispensable parts of a system." That you created and controlled. A necessary system, Kate. One that cannot accommodate dissent. I promise you it is not what you think it is. It turns out nothing ever was. And I'm not looking away anymore. Oh. I see. In the 25th hour, you suddenly grew a conscience. Don't do this, Varrick. Don't you do this, Kate. My entire fucking life, I never loved anyone, except you. Come on, V. We both know you only love yourself. Life had such… Big things waiting for you. My life wasn't mine. Till now. It's okay. It's okay. Go on. Okay. Great shot. I got you. Hey, hey. Yeah. It's okay. I know you. No, no, no. It's okay.
