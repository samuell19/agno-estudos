We can do better. Again. Bye. Hm. Yes! Hey! What're you doing? Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! You can't just go around taking people's things, you little... You little girl. I'm not gonna hurt you. But you need to learn how to leave strangers alone. You understand? I'm not some charity. You need to go back to wherever it is that you came from. Leave me alone. Good talk. Now, go on! Get! What? What? What is it? What do you want? I told you. I'm not gonna hurt you. But saying somethin'. Tell me your name. Tell me why you're out here all by yourself. Somebody's gotta be looking for you. Where's your mommy? Where's your daddy? Nobody? You're just here. What're you up to? Well, I can't just leave you here. Come with me. Come on. This is what I always wanted! So what in the holy hell are you doing out here all alone, huh? Huh? Come on, kid. Cut the silence. Say something, will you? What's your name? Hi, I'm Jack. I bet you're pretty, pretty thirsty, huh? Yeah. Well, I will let you have some of the water from my canteen if you ask for it nicely. Please. That's "please", right? Yeah? Okay. I took a little sign language. Back in school, but that was a little while ago. Let's see if we can figure this out, huh? I was always better at understanding So, tell me, why don't you talk, huh? What's your name? No name. You don't have a name? Everybody's got a name. Hey. I got an idea. Why don't you come with me? Yeah. You can bring the water. I think I know something that'll cheer you up. Hey, come on. Here, look. Watch that. Can't have you dying on me. All right, enough of this. Come on. Let's go. You can wear that back to camp. And then I expect it back. You understand me? Let's go. So, here's the deal. You can spend the night here but first thing in the morning, you're gonna go back to wherever it is you came from. You hear me? Thank you for the food. There's some blankets over there. That tent over there is mine. Do not come in there. Goodnight. She needed you! She needed you and you weren't there! You were never there! Here. I'll take that back now. Let's go. We got work to do. Why would you do that? You were going to kill it! Yeah, I was gonna kill it. That was our dinner. I'm sorry. You're sorry? Yeah, well, we'll both be sorry with empty stomachs. Don't ever touch my gun again. She's beautiful, isn't she? Yeah. You should see her in the winter. When she freezes over. And that ice, it's as thick as your head. Even thicker. Good fishin', too. You like that? Yeah, why don't you try? Here. Okay. We'll figure this out. Here, another cool one. And what you wanna do, you wanna lean way over, almost like you're fallin' over. And then you gotta, you gotta, snap, snap your wrist. Yeah. Yeah. Aria. You know what that is? It's a song that stands alone. But it holds its own. It's untouchable. You remind me of an Aria. Do you mind if I call you that? I mean, I've gotta call you somethin'. It's beautiful. It suits you. Wait. Aria, wait! You can't run from me, maggot! I'll find you! I gave you both everything. I even bought the little maggot braces to fix her disgusting teeth. Do you know how much that cost me? Do you have any idea how much that cost me? I don't understand. Oh, stop your deaf wavin'. Get out of my way. I'm gonna teach you what it's like to disrespect me. Are you okay? Are you hurt? It's me. Jack. It's okay. It's okay. It was just a tree. What did you think it was anyway? He's coming. Who's coming? Big Al. Who's Big Al? You really are a vindictive bastard, you know that? Yeah. You. Wherever you are. This doesn't change anything. I hope you know that. Why do I even waste my time with you? You're a joke. Hey. Come on. It's okay. In there. Get some sleep. Hm. You were shaking like a leaf. Don't get used to it. Fish? Yeah. I couldn't sleep, so I went and caught these. Hope you like fish. Mama and I used to fish. Yeah. I bet she misses you so much, huh? Mama... she died. I'm sorry. I miss her. Yeah. What about your daddy? I bet he can't wait to see you. He's... He killed her! He killed Mama! Aria? Is your daddy looking for you? Is that why you're up here? What happened? You don't have to tell me if you don't wanna. I had to save Mama. You are both gonna learn to respect me! Are you listening? Oh, that's right. You can't. Because you're a stupid, deaf waste of space. Stay quiet. What're you telling her? Hey, what're you telling her? What're you telling her? What are you telling her? I'm gonna kill you. You need to run! Never stop! Never come back! Never. Come with me. He'll catch us both. I love you. I love you too. I should've done that years ago. You can't run from me, maggot! I'll find you! Shh. You're safe now. Okay? I'm scared! I know. It's okay. You can stay with me. I won't send you away. Okay? I won't send you anywhere. She's been out there about a week. Think if we go back where I killed her mama, we'll pick up a trail from there. She's probably dead, all right? And you don't look like you're in the best shape of your life right now, either. Are you questioning me, baby brother? - You wanna run things now? - No, Al. Roy, she saw what I did, and that could come back on all of us. She can't even speak. You know, you are an idiot, Roy. You know that? She can talk, believe me. Oh, really? You ever heard her? No, but I know she can. Stop your crying and gear up. She's out there by herself. We'll find her. It's gonna take more than a little maggot to kill Big Al. - Go! - All right. - Go! - All right! You two, get in the back! Come on! Yeah! That was an awesome cast. Okay, now what you wanna do is you wanna let that worm sink all the way to the bottom, 'cause that's where the fish are, and that's what we wanna catch, 'cause we're hungry. So once the line stops moving, that means it's on the bottom and at that point, that's when you wanna start to slowly reel it in. Not yet. So after you start reeling it in, you're gonna wait for a tug, 'cause that's the fish, and then you wanna yank it back and catch the fish! And I want you to reel that fish in, okay? Yeah! So go ahead and start to reel it and when you feel that tug, that's the fish and... It's okay. There's a learning curve. All right? What? I... Why are you splashing yourself? What're you doing? No, you're gonna scare the fish away! Look, you scared the fish away! That, that's on you. No! No, look. Here, hold this. I'm gonna get a fish. You're so silly! Why did you fall for that? You're out. Oh, my god. Tonight, we feast. I want the fat one. As you should. For he who geets it, eats it. Hm. Okay. You did not like that one. Okay. No dad jokes. It's for you. It's a little big. You know, but I think you'll grow into it. I mean, you can't stay in those dirty things forever, you know? Besides... You smell really bad. Thank you, it's beautiful. I don't know about all that, but, uh... Here you go. Try it on. Go ahead. Wow. How did I miss a little princess dance right into my camp? Do you like it? Good. I'm glad. What's that? Oh, it's nothin', it's just... It's just something I wear, that's all. Did someone give it to you? I don't really wanna talk about it, all right? Can I try it on? No! Aria, I'm sorry. I shouldn't yell at you, I just... It's just not something I talk about, all right? Did it belong to someone special? Yeah. Very special. Too special for the likes of me. That's for sure. But enough about this old grump, huh? Let's grill some fish, yeah? Al, Al, Al, Al! Al, Al, stop! I see it. - Is it hers? - Yeah, it is. Give me that. Looks like she went up the mountain. So, we're gonna have to hoof it from here. Let's go. Dad. I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to spy. Sorry I took your notebook. I was going to put it back. You know, some of my best work is in that book. I would appreciate it if you asked me next time, okay? Well... What did you think? I think that with some more practice, you can do better. Sorry, I woke you. It's okay. I was just having a bad dream. What do you say we go on a little adventure today? Yeah? Yeah. Hey. You ever fly in a plane before? Would you like to? Yeah? Hold that thought. Well, I don't exactly have a plane, but uh, we could still fly. 'Ay. No peakin'. Captain, prepare for takeoff. Oh! What're you laughing at? Can I try You wanna try? Absolutely. Here. A lot further than mine did. Wanna do some more? Yeah. Me too. Thank you for teaching me how to fly. You're welcome. It belonged to my daughter. The necklace. It's the only thing I have left of hers. I wasn't there for her. In the end... I let her die... All alone. I wasn't there. My little girl died alone. Without her daddy. Let's finish strong. Hey, Dad. I'm still here. Where are you? Call me back. - Hey, sweetie. - Hi. Is he coming? I'm sure he'll be here soon. Okay. Okay. Hey, Mom. I can't get through to Dad and you're not picking up. I'm walking home. I'll see you soon. Hey, Mom. Yeah, surprise-surprise. His dress rehearsal went late. I don't know. I'm almost home. Jack. Well done. I am very pleased. Congratulations. It's gonna be a huge success. Looking forward to it. Hi, baby. I'm on my way. Hello, who is this? Yeah? What? It was my fault Mama died. Don't say that. That's not what happened. Mama tried to save me. I was too heavy. She had to set me down. That's not what happened. Bad things happen to good people. That doesn't mean that it's their fault. Okay? It wasn't your fault. What was your daughter's name? Melody. Her name was Melody. That is a beautiful name. That's a beautiful thing to say. Look out. No! You wanna let her know we're comin'? I thought I saw something! Listen to me. Let me do the thinking. You do somethin' stupid like that again, I'm gonna put a bullet in your head. Al, knock it off, all right? He was just trying to help. Shut up, Roy. I don't care if you're my brother. Let me get somethin' straight here with all you. Look at me. I got enough bullets for each and every one of you. Let's go! Go. Don't give me that look. - I saw somethin'! - Put the gun down and go! Gun down! What was that? It's probably nothin'. That storm's gonna be on us soon. We better pick up the pace. Come on. Oh! We were almost stuck in that one, huh? Ah! It's really coming down. Wow. Are you scared of a little rainstorm? It's okay. It's not that bad, 'cause it's still quite a ways off. Wanna know how I know that? You see, it's in the time between the lightning and the thunder. I'll show you, okay? It's three kilometers. It's pretty far. You try. Three kilometers. Three kilometers. That's like two miles. That's far, right? It's not so scary when you look at it that way, you know? Aria? Can I ask you a question? It's about Big Al. Do you think that he has any big scary friends that would help him if he asked them if he needed them? My uncle, Roy. He never hurt us, but he never stopped Big Al. Uh-huh? Is there anybody else, you think? There are two. Two of 'em. The first one is really tall. His name is Bo. The second one is shorter. I don't remember his name. But he has black hair. Mama called them the silent two. They don't say much, but if people don't pay, they hurt them. Do you think they are coming to get me? Yeah. Well, I'm a big believer in looking at things the way that they really are and I'm not gonna lie to you. I think they're coming. But if they are, they haven't found us yet. And they're probably real far away still. But if they do find us, and they may never find us, but if they do, I need to be ready, you know? What do you mean, ready? I will never let them take you. But they have guns. You're probably right. But I have something that they don't have. What? You. And you're worth fighting for. I'm scared. I know. I know you're scared. But courage isn't about not being afraid. It's about being afraid and still doing something about it. I don't feel brave. That's the funny thing about bravery. Oftentimes, the brave ones don't know that they are, until they have to be. But just know this. If they're looking for us, and they find us and they try and take you, I will kill them all. You promise? I promise. I mean it with all my heart. Yeah. Brave. Brave. Hm. Hey, you. It's me again. Sorry about calling you a vindictive bastard. But I need a favor. I know I don't deserve one. But I'm gonna ask anyway. I'll wait to use this, if you help me keep her safe. But if anything happens to her, if she dies, I swear... I swear I'll use it. You understand me? I may already be dead, but if I'm not, no more hesitation. This little game is over. I know you don't care about me, or what happens to me. Maybe you're not even there. But if you're there, God, show me what to do. Show me, please. There I go again. Talking to the sky. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now, right? Al, I found her trail! What's wrong? Over here! I found her! Where? Over here! Step where I step, okay? Over here, over here! You find a friend, maggot? He's not gonna save you. Go get her. Come on. No, no! No! Well, she went and found herself a protector. I don't know, Al. This is dangerous. This guy knows this place better than we do, and he's expecting us. Four of us, one of him. Do the math, Roy. You, get up. It went through my leg, Al! I need to get to a hospital! Hey, the only way we're leaving this mountain is with the maggot. She's mine. Come here, come here. Hurry up there. Go, go, go, go, go. Let's go. It's all clear. Al. Listen, I'm telling you. We need to go back, man. This guy's prepared for this, okay? No! He dies tonight. You're speaking my language now. We better get off this trail. Come here, baby. Come here. Get down, get down. I need you to stay here, okay? If we're gonna stand a chance, I'm gonna need to use this, and I cannot risk hitting you in the crossfire, okay? I don't want you to die! I know you're scared, but I made a promise that I intend to keep, okay? Remember. We are brave. Brave. Yeah. Please. Let me save her. Please. Aria! Come on out! Come on out and put the rifle down! I know you're out there, mister! Just put it down! You better stop playing with me, mister! I'll kill her! Put down your weapons and walk away! Why would we do that? 'Cause if you don't, I'll kill every single one of you! Don't move! Don't move! Go. Go ahead! I'll put you down for good this time. Don't play with me, mister. You shoot me, she falls. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? You want this? No, no! Okay, okay, okay! - Now. - Okay. Don't hurt her. Please. Please. I'm putting the gun down. It's okay. I'm putting the gun down. Okay. Boy, that was stupid. Take her, Roy. Get her, get her. Aria. Why? All this? She's less than nothing. Why would you choose death for her? What've you got here? Oh. Well... Oh! I like this. You know, I always wanted one of these. You know she stabbed me? I didn't think she had it in her but that maggot stabbed me. She stabbed me right about... Here! Now you're gonna know that maggot will only bring you pain and death. Look at me! You're gonna die. You're gonna die knowing it was all for nothing. Her name is Aria. What did you say to me? Her name is Aria. Kill him! That's it. Jack! Don't hurt him! Surprise-surprise. It finally speaks. Get her. Come here, come here. No! You stay right there. They say when you're on your way out, you go into a big tunnel of light. I always wanted to know if that's true. So, do me a favor and tell me. Yeah? Nice necklace. That's it. There ya go. I got you. I got you. There you go. There you go. Jack! Look at him! You're the one that did this. You're the one that did this! Let's go. Come on. Go. Cut it out. Who are you? Drop the rifle! Do it! I'll kill her! Do what I tell ya, mister! Do it! Come on! You kill my men, huh? You kill my brother? For what? This? This little maggot? Why? She doesn't even have a name! You What're you telling her? are brave. This isn't over. She doesn't get to walk away! What're you doing? No, no! Wait, wait! I've got money. I'll let her go! No, wait, wait, wait! It's beautiful, isn't it? The view? No. Life. I'd almost forgotten. Me too. I'll go start packing up camp. Okay. Thank you.
