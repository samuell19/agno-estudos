For the desire you have To guide your steps To keep your emotions To listen to your beating heart To know how to look At a starry sky Reaching out with your hands To your destiny Want more Tomorrow again Leaving one day without return To erase our love Without looking back Not regretting Thinking of tomorrow, starting over "Andéol"? Is that a real name? Hang on, if I take the last bus... leaving at 9:04 PM, I'll be back around 12, 12:30 AM. Coo-ey! No, but seriously... No, you can't veto "Lucius" and suggest "Andéol"! Gotta go, I've been seen. Bye. Your dad is in a filthy mood. You OK, Mom? - Good trip? - Yeah. BYE BYE Remember where we live? - Gérard, don't start! - I'm interested. Maybe he forgot. Well, take an interest in the road. - Remember we're moving tomorrow? - Yes, Dad. - Anna and my future grandson OK? - Yeah. "My future grandson"! He'll be my grandson, too. Let him answer. Oh, God! Sorry for bullying "your" son. Well, I have some ideas for the name if you like. Yeah, great. You only have that bag? Not staying? No, Mom, I told you I had work to do. Well... you can write 300 pages on us peasants... but traveling 300 kms to come see us... that's another matter. I never wrote that! - Of course not. - Wait a minute. What are you doing? Looking for my notes. OK with you? There we are. "When you grew up with your feet in cow shit, you can run, but the stink follows you." Page 144. I didn't write "peasants". Are you quoting my own book now? Well, don't you like tributes? - What're you doing? - The author is here, for once. You could've smiled for the photo! Look at your miserable face. And your haircut! You can sign copies for my friends in the choir. And Chantal. She keeps asking me. - Who's Chantal? - My friend from Le Tréport. Her son's a bookseller. He's your age. Still hooked on those cookies? Hey. You've not changed much. Maybe the hair a bit. - Can I put this down? - Sure. I've changed a bit. - Congratulations. - Thanks. So, are you lost? No, I was looking for the yogurt section. This place is too big for me. I meant, why are you in town? But you can also tell me why you're in the cookie aisle! Yeah, I'm stupid! Well, my parents are moving house because my dad is retiring. So, I've come to help them, you know. - Not taking over from him? - Nope. Do you often buy your own book? No, it's not me. It's my mother. It's for Chantal. It's a friend of hers. Her son has a bookstore in Le Tréport... Lucky you're a better writer than speaker! I have a break. Coffee? Well, actually, I'm with my parents. Tonight? If you're free. Well, I... I don't know yet. I was supposed to help them pack... Never mind. See you in 10 years' time! Well, leave me your number, so if I'm free in the end... Yeah, OK. Here you are. Little Julien Béguin's father is waiting for him at the customer service desk. I finish work at 7 PM if your parents let you out till 12! Call me. Cherbourg Swimming Club Since... Since we... will never... live together... Since we're crazy... Since we're alone... Since there are so many of them... Even morals speak for them I'd still like to tell you Everything I've ever written I drew it from the ink of your eyes You'll come to walk in my dreams You'll always come from the side where the sun rises And if despite that I manage to forget you I'd still like to tell you All that I have written Will long have the scent of regret I'm free in the end Hey, Anna, it's me. Well, I won't make it home tonight in the end. There's more to sort than I thought. But I'll be back tomorrow, I promise. Kisses. Juju, look, this guy... Enough TV! I wanted him to see the guy. He knows everything. He's won 52 times. 52! Imagine that. Is your new novel progressing? Yeah... How many chapters are done? 10? 5? Something like that. Yeah, you haven't started! I have! Well, you can come to the new house if you've got writer's block. We don't mind. It's quiet. I don't have writer's block. I'm just trying to help. Writing among peasants worked. Dad! Sorry. You don't say that. Forgive me. My mistake. He's getting out his notebook again. If you don't mind... Here we are. "Back home, the most cultivated thing was the potato field next to the highway." Page 112. Well, it's a joke. We weren't surrounded by Nobel Prize winners! - True. - What're you talking about? It's true, come to think of it. It's not wrong. So, he calls us morons, and you defend him? Not us. It's a joke. It's a joke that means we're morons. I'll leave you to finish your last night, lovers. So soon? We haven't had time to talk. Make your complaints tomorrow morning. 'Night. This isn't the evening I had planned. At least you won't get harassed by people asking about TV stars. Most TV stars are very nice actually. - Does this old trick still work? - Yeah. Show me if you can still do the backstroke! - Sorry. - Shut doors make me nervous. Don't worry, I didn't see a thing. It's like back in school. What? You promised to show me your breasts. On the way back from the UK. You remember that? I mostly remember you don't keep your promises! Is that why you came back? To see my breasts! It's crazy, it hasn't changed. Not much changes here. Have you done that job long? Supermarket work? Say it, it's not an insult. No, but I... It's been 5 years. At first, it was a summer job. It's OK. The girls are nice. We have a laugh. Never thought of leaving here? Leaving this island paradise? And... does that baby have a father? Yes, I'm not the Virgin Mary! Who is it? - You don't know the Virgin Mary? - Very funny. Seriously. It's Yohan. Yohan... Guiche? No! Wait, Yohan Guiche, tracksuit, terrible acne, brush cut? That Yohan Guiche? Didn't he also do metal detecting? He still does. But he gave up the tracksuits. You blew me out all through school only to end up with Yohan Guiche! If you hadn't run off to Paris, I might not have ended up with him. What do you mean? - You know very well. - No, I don't. What? Are you serious? - You didn't notice? - No, I didn't! Otherwise you would have noticed that I noticed! Couldn't you be simpler too? You pick up the phone: "Hi, Julien, it's me, I'm into you. Want us to be together?" Then, I would have noticed! "Hi, Julien, I'm into you. Want us to be together?" It ain't exactly poetry. Sorry I'm a bit more subtle! Well, so subtle that I didn't understand. Yeah... Is that why you never wrote to me? I wrote 300 pages, they're in all the bookstores! No! - What? - No. I didn't read it. - Is this a joke? - No, I didn't read it. Unbelievable! No, I was annoyed, I didn't want to hear about you. Crazy... No, but I'll read it now. I will. Yeah, I'll read it. If you haven't bought all the copies in the area! We're such losers. Maybe it was fate that didn't want us to end up together. Fate wanted me to end up with Yohan... Guiche! Where were you? Invited by some friends to a party, we had fun, I didn't see the time! - Oh, yeah? - It's true! I know you by heart. Why do you act like a thief? You're imagining things. I didn't want to wake you up. What're you playing at? I'm sick of you staying out late and hanging out with those losers! It's late, darling, keep it down. They're not losers, they're my friends! Friends? Why do they call me when you're not around? Out of respect for you? The bastards! Didn't you know? They tell me about your exploits! As soon as you go out, they call me and hit on me. You caught them at it! You know you're the only one for me, stay cool baby, or I'll say bye-bye! You know you're the only one for me, stay cool, man or I'll say bye-bye! You know you're the only one for me, stay cool baby, or I'll say bye-bye! Congratulations! I was going to tell you. Write me! I'll read it this time. So? Time to go? Shouldn't I ask you two that? - Has Dad gone? - At 5 AM, with the movers. You know what he's like. I'll try to call him. I signed them for you. Bye, Mom. Gérard Béguin. Dad, it's me. I wanted to talk, but I guess you're driving. I wanted to tell you the first line of my next book. I saw that you like to memorize my books. "It's not enough to leave things for things to leave you." That'll be page 1. Kisses. You will forget the smiles, the looks That spoke of eternity All those words that we swear To never forget You will forget You will forget me You will forget Your impatient patience Hanging on the phone The first date That one night I finally give you That night that changed my whole life You will forget If it was in April In September or July If it was sunny Or if it was raining You will forget You will forget me You will forget The sun that my hands Gave birth to in yours The delirious happiness That made your veins burn And that cry to the sky That ends in an "I love you" You will forget Everything about us When your breath is short When her eyes are blurry When you make love to her You will forget You will forget me You will forget Like a movie playing on a black screen Because love, you know, has no memory No memory No memory...
