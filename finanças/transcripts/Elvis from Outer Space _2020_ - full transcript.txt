[frogs croaking] [plane engine roaring] [dramatic music] [Big M] Okay then. I'll tell you how I met Elvis. It was when he came back from Alpha Centauri. You see, he had been living there for the past 30 years with friendly aliens. He was almost dead when they got him. So they transferred his energy, his essence, into a bio-engineered body they'd built for him called a biosuit. He looked a little different but he felt like he was 25 again. At first he was happy, they'd saved his life. He saw what no other man had ever seen. He knew the friendship of beings from another world and he found new fans everywhere he went. Turns out music really is the universal language. So the universe loved Elvis, of course. But as the years went by, he got more and more homesick. Something was troubling him. He took to singing the blues, his heart was filled with pain. The aliens were so empathetic they could hardly bear it when he sang those sad songs. So they decided to take him back home, so maybe he could be happy again. There was just one problem, you see, the body they'd built for Elvis had been grown in space, in a low gravity environment. The aliens didn't know how the cells would hold up on Earth. I mean, you got your gravity, atmospheric pressure, and whatnot, out in space, they didn't have those kinda problems. What they did know was that the skeleton would start to collapse, and the cells would age at an accelerated rate. His organs would cease to function, and his heart would stop beating. If he didn't get back to the ship in time, he would die. But Elvis didn't care. He was willing to take the chance, he had to take the chance. [calm music] [computer beeping] He's coming. It cannot be stopped, he sends you this message. Can you please help me find a woman named Linda? Linda Beth Truman, born around 1960. I don't have much time, so please, please help me find Linda Truman. [engine whirring] [instruments beeping] [dramatic music] ["Also Sprach Zarathustra" playing] [whirring] ["Also Sprach Zarathustra" continues] [wind blowing] [Big M] It was 2007, out there on federal land. The CIA picked him up... Good evening, sir. [Big M] ...somewhere south of Vegas. Top secret stuff. Only those with top level clearances knew about the mission. This group of agents was a special detail organized by the CIA to escort and protect Elvis while he was here on Earth. [soft music playing] [woman in film] Oh, yeah. Kirby's in the car, they've picked up the guy and they'll be here any minute. Yes sir. [Vanderbiik] Why they wanna do this in the middle of the damn night's beyond me. I'm getting too old for this. When they said "Vegas," this is not what I was expecting. Hey, Kirby, I'm putting the president's office through to Agent Messina on a secure line. [Big M] Agent Messina was a rookie, but she was the expert on Elvis Presley. [phone ringing] Yes, sir? Yes, Mr. President, he's right here. He's ready to rock. [chuckling] Yes, he's ready to rock-n-roll. Um... Yes, I understand, Mr. President. We'll do it, sir. Hello, sir. Just wanted to say that I'm proud of what you're doing for our Roswell project. We look forward to your continued cooperation. I wanted to tell ya that I am a big fan and so are my daughters. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much. [phone line clicking] Mr. Burrows, as you know, we are in communication with your friends. [agent 1] Why did you come back? We had an agreement, and we thought you were happy up there. [President] We made clear that this is most uncomfortable for us. We want you to take him back. We will not. And why not? It is his wish to see his child. [President] To hell with his wishes! [Big M] They were supposed to be going to Vegas, but they drove right through. Elvis started to feel a little uneasy. Has the Linda meeting been set up? Not yet, the chief will explain that to you. [instruments beeping] [dramatic music] [Big M] It was a simple little building, way off the road, you'd barely notice it, but it had levels that went deep underground, some people say like 15 floors down. Deep into the bedrock of the mountains. They say government scientists had alien bodies down there and they did experiments. When Area 51 closed down, the government just moved all of that stuff out there and called it Area 52. I'm all the way down here on level 10. This place gives me the creeps. And don't even talk about what's in those labs. I thought I saw a head in a cabinet the other day. [dramatic music] [gun clicking] We can't just let you wander around freely. I'm afraid you'll be considered under house arrest until further notice. Wait a minute, this is not part of the mission. We're supposed to simply communicate. We have orders, Messina, orders which you are not privy to. Now stay out of this, and don't ever question me again. Is that clear? [Big M] Now she was in over her head, but, she had a job to do, and she was gonna do it. Now, the guys at the top had bigger problems. [Vanderbiik] Do you know they sent in the freakin' Chairman? [man 1 on TV] What? Now, what in the hell could be going on out here in the middle of nowhere that they need to send in the damn Chairman? [indistinct chatter over TV] He's upstairs, I gotta go. [dramatic music] Our little friends at Roswell are full of some pretty neat tricks. True, but we've known that for some time. [Big M] Of course, the aliens knew all about Area 52. They'd gone there long ago to see what the CIA was up to. They'd gone over every inch of that place, and had cameras everywhere. [dramatic music] So, what now, sir, we just keep him here forever? [President] No, no, no. I tell you what, we phone home, we tell our friends we wanna return the package ASAP. [agent 1] All right, you heard the man, let's get back to work. [Big M] The other agents closed ranks. Messina felt the chill. [dramatic music] His presence here is potentially disastrous! He is entitled to some time on his own. He was never a prisoner. I believe your people call it a karmic imperative. Karmic imperative? He needed some time at home. - [static buzzing] - [President] Damn this thing! I hate supercilious aliens from Alpha Centauri. There's just something about them. [dramatic music] What now, sir? Well, we keep him confined until further notice, we don't have any choice. [man 2 on TV] Baba Duece! Probably break the safe, man. [man 2 laughing] Give it up for JJ Fatmac so big they call him Falvis Right to the balls then, huh? [man 2 laughing] [approaching footsteps] Tompkins, please admit the lovely Agent Messina. - [Tompkins] Yes, sir. - She's cleared to deliver lunch. [dramatic music] Hungry? Is there anything you need? Yes, sir, all set. Monitor the cell at all times, do not leave my post, and notify you of any status changes ASAP, sir. [Big M] But as it turned out, Agent Messina had some friends of her own. [upbeat music] Untraceable, invisible, and highly reliable friends. [phone ringing] Well, how's my favorite secret agent? Hi, Folger, long time no speak. Listen, I need a favor from you. Kiddo, you saved my life back in that Pakistan nightmare. I still owe you big time. Have you heard of Project King: Memphis Rising? [Messina] Well, I'm a part of it, sort of. I'm not in the loop. Messina, my dear, if there was something called Project King: Memphis Rising, I'd know about it. Would you? [man 3 on TV] Two Irishmen are walking past a pub in Dublin, it could happen, you know? Huh? [groaning] [JB] Oh, god. [JB groaning] I'm sick. [coughing] Something is happening. Somebody, somebody, help me. Tompkins, check on him, something's wrong. Yes, sir. I'll check on him right away. [static buzzing] [banging] Tompkins, Tompkins. [upbeat music] [groaning] Working with the United States government? Elvis? Folger, can you do some digging for me? I'm an ex-spy, dear. But according to the plate on the door a bit of a big shot. [action music] [groaning] Come on. Do you have any idea what you're involved in? I do. [Folger] "Project King: Memphis Rising." Initiated August 16, 1977. The clandestine removal of the dying Elvis Presley. A substitute corpse planted in Graceland mansion. And then subsequent transfer to the Roswellian collective founded on September 1, 1946. Then by saucer to the planet Gleedus. Let me save you from further reading. I'm a part of the unit that was supposed to meet the reconstituted essence of the late Elvis Presley, code name JB, at a location not far from Las Vegas, Nevada for reasons that are further classified, et cetera, et cetera. What do you want me to do? The King is back, Folger. We have a rogue operation within the company that is trying to contain him. [Messina] Again, for national security purposes. [upbeat rock music] [whirring] You have a good night, sir, huh. But JB's gonna need some help. Can I ask you for another favor? Name it. Round up his old crew. [Messina] Friends, band mates, bodyguards, anyone. [ominous music] I'll do a global, but why? [approaching footsteps] Listen, I need to call you back. I'll talk to you later. [Folger] Space aliens? [upbeat music] - [sizzles] - [clatters] Sir, something's happened. He was sick, Tompkins opened the door, and the whole system went dead. Tompkins is no longer responding. I can't reach anybody. We have no backup, sir. It's so dark down here. Freeze, JB. Now what? Now... get the hell outta here. [upbeat music] [Big M] So that's how Elvis escaped from the CIA. [dramatic music] [Big M] Vegas is a tough town, and I was mixed up with some of the toughest. I owed money to Big Little Joey. Joey was a bully and a bottom feeder. You could always find him at the cheapest place in town making everybody miserable. Let me see just what I'm paying for. - Oh, that'll cost you extra. - Come on. Hey, don't worry about nothing, you're gonna get your money. Now, let me see. - Take off your top! - Ow! [slaps] Ho, and you do mama, you do. Okay, sweetie, come on up here a little higher. [Big M] And I wasn't worried, I knew I had the contest sewn up. All the people loved me. [women screaming] It was gonna be just like last year. All the usual players. Liberty Rocket was back, he was mostly in it for the clothes. For Big El, it was really all about the dance. And of course, JJ Harris, back and bigger than ever. Yeah, he was an emotional wreck, and binge eating. JJ what are you doing? [Big M] But the mob was putting pressure on Joey, and Joey was loving putting the squeeze on me. Come on, come on, baby, come on. Yeah, oh yeah, ho, ho, ho. Oh, you got hands. Oh, you've got some hands. Yeah, go for it, baby. Morning, sweetheart. - Hi, baby. - [crunching] - [yelling] - Uh-oh, sweet touch. [whimpering] [laughing] All right, let's go Scissors, before I lose my temper. [Big M] So I had to win to pay off those thugs and get Joey off my back once and for all. Bastard! So that's how I got so into it. [audience cheering] It wasn't just another Elvis contest, this one was for everything. [announcer] It's the 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition. New songs written for The King himself, and a $500,000 prize are bringing out the world's best Elvis impersonators. You don't wanna miss this, all next week at the Desert Sand Hotel and Theater September 5, 6, 7, and 8, 2:00 and 8:00 p.m. In Vegas, baby. [Big M] The 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition was run by Ms. Jackie Nolan, and she loved Elvis in all of his many forms. - Thank you very much. - Mm, looking sharp, gentlemen. Ooh, I'm sorry ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay, young lady? I'm fine, I do that all the time. I'm kinda like a klutz queen. - I see. - Sorry. It's okay. Sorry, fellas. I'm on the list, ma'am, name is John Burrows. [receptionist] Uh, your name is not on the list, sir, and registration is almost closed. I don't understand, there must be some mistake. [receptionist] One moment. [Big M] Now, Jackie knew JB's name was on the list, she was holding the list. [classic music playing] - JB. - Yes ma'am. Looks like you're all set. Good luck, Mr. Burrows. Jackie Nolan, meeting you may be all the luck I need. [audience cheering, applauding] ♪ Already love you, whoa ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Baby it's you, oh ♪ Thank you, God bless you all, thank you. [audience cheering, applauding] Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen, the Big M, last year's 1970's Elvis World Crown Champion. Remember, here, Elvis is always in the building. And we have the best pay out slots on the strip. So, as always, have a good and lucky night. [dramatic music] [Big M]He couldn't believe it, he was in Vegas, again. He wondered if the people he knew and loved would be able to recognize him. Would Linda accept him? Would the fans? He just didn't know. Once, he ruled this town, now, he was a stranger. It felt like a dream, and soon. it would be over. We had some of our best people on the job, sir. Tompkins is a damn black belt. Excuse me, a black belt, sir. We felt certain we had JB contained. [Chairman] Yeah, but now, he's loose on the world very good work, Chief. Allow me to applaud your... How should I put it? Glacial progress in this matter. Sir, we feel that we will have him in custody shortly. Our resources are already at work on it now. [Chairman] Well, since we can kill a sparrow with a suborbital satellite, our resources better be pretty damn good. [Big M] Their resources stank. The CIA didn't know where Elvis was, but the aliens did. He was in Vegas, baby. [upbeat music] He loved the feel of real gravity and breathing the cool, desert night air. Right here, right now. Being alive felt amazing. He was flying, he was home, it was Vegas, and he was The King. [somber music] [female reporter] And tonight on "Your Vegas News at 11," it's Barry from "Barry Live!" He's here in Vegas to host the 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition, with an unheard of half million dollar prize. Coming up next. Barry, can you give us a statement? I am honored that they've asked me back to host the 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition once again this year. All of these performers, they truly love The King. And this is how they chose to remember him, as a vibrant, powerful singer. And a world class showman. I'm proud to be a part of it. [female reporter] Barry, this event goes on for four days, will you be covering it on your show? You bet, tune in tomorrow, we'll be recapping each day's events on "Barry Live," and this is the biggest prize that's ever been offered in the category. And well, we're expecting a lot of excitement. [reporter] Stay tuned for more of your Vegas news after this. [Big M] The next morning, the CIA must've been watching "Barry Live!" I'm sure they were just loving it. Imagine, they couldn't control what was coming outta Barry's mouth, it was live TV. It was just this crazy moment where they couldn't touch anyone. It was all too public.

All this week we are in beautiful and exciting Las Vegas, Nevada where I am so honored to be here to host for the second time the 1970s Elvis World Crown Competition. Now last night was the opening ceremony where last year's winner, Big M, a fantastic performer, kicked off this year's competition for an incredible $500,000 prize. [upbeat music] [male singer] ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Give it up, give it up Give it up ♪ Now some people ask me, why focus on the 1970's Elvis? Well, it turns out that among rabid Elvis fans, those last years were some of The King's best. Because of the problems he endured, it opened his heart in a way that touched so many so deeply. So today, we wanna talk about the cult of the '70s Elvis. It turns out that when The King was, well, more king sized his fans loved him just the same, and it's still true today. Take a look at some of these contestants. It's hard to believe, but women of all ages are here in Vegas to scream and shout in celebration of these whale-sized competitors. I believe that when it comes to the memory of Elvis, Vegas loves and misses him in an especially deep way. He will always be The King here. [Barry] And although the fans were out last night, later today, we expect record crowds at the preliminary rounds where we'll see some old favorites from years past. And some new talent out to prove their The King of kings and take home that half million dollar prize. [male singer] ♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪ [soft music] Are you the lady we're supposed to see? [Messina] I am, gentlemen, have seat. [Big M] Agent Messina had been doing her homework. First, she got her man on the inside to find Elvis' old security force, Sonny West and The Rock. And had them flown to Vegas. Now, she had to tell them everything she knew about JB, and they had to believe her because she needed their help to protect him. Elvis needed protection from the CIA. What I'm about to tell you is gonna blow your mind. You're gonna have to trust me on this. [Big M] So she told 'em about the alien's ship, and how they had kept Elvis alive, and how he was back. And the CIA wasn't happy about it. He was about to go onstage and sing, and they could go see for themselves. If he ever needed 'em, he needed 'em now. [women cheering] You nervous, JB? Oh, not at all, but I do get butterflies when I'm talking to you. Oh, you flatter me. Hmm. I'm trying. Hell, maybe we can have a ginger ale later on. Talk about my nerves.

At this point, he didn't know what those people were capable of. [upbeat music] [Big M] But Agent Messina said she had a plan. So she sent them off to the local diner to wait further instructions. Is it possible? Sonny West, I can't believe my eyes. [Sonny] I gotta tell you something. I'm very sorry that I never got to say goodbye to you. Yeah. [sighs] I loved you, man, I missed you. Yeah, yeah. I know The Rock did, too. [Sonny] And when the curtain comes down on the finalists, it's gonna make some big headlines, you know that. It's like it's all over again, this stuff starts all over. I know it, man. We'll be there for you. [JB] Yeah, yeah. We will be there for you, right, Rock? Yeah. I'm gonna need real tight security from here on out. It's gonna be something, it's gonna be a hell of a ride out there, Rock? - Yeah. God... - God... 30 years, man. Hey, man. [male singer] ♪ Barry Live ♪ ♪ Very, very ♪ ♪ Give it up now ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ Give it up now ♪ ♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪ [Barry] Hello everyone, and welcome, welcome to another special edition of "Barry Live!" Coming to you from the amazing Las Vegas, Nevada, and the 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition. This contest has certainly delivered on so many levels. First of all, last night's musical competition was incredible. There is a new kid in town, and he's putting the other Elvis' to shame. Mr. John Burrows came from nowhere to wow the audiences last night. He seemed to actually be Elvis at times as he took the stage and rocked the house with authority. [Barry] This guy is amazing. I couldn't believe my eyes, and neither could the sold out crowd who went wild for this new guy. Sir, he's all over the TV, he entered some contest at the Desert Sand Hotel, and he's winning. Everybody's talking about it, he's on "Barry Live!" now. On a sad note, a beloved performer, Mr. JJ Harris, was spotted in this exclusive cell phone video, as he attempted to end his own life after seeing Mr. Burrows perform. I'm heading home, pal, I ain't gonna win this thing. Not against JB. And I can't take the pain. Time to hold hands with Jesus. Come on, JJ, it's just a show. [male singer] ♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪ Of course, with a cool half mil in the balance, everyone is feeling the pressure. Later today and tonight, the competition continues with round after round of fierce live performances. I have never seen anything like it. So, be sure to tune in tomorrow for more about this epic and historic competition. Coming up next, fan fashion and dining bargains everyone should know about. Right here on "Barry Live!" We'll be right back. We got two of them there judges in our pocket already. Yeah, we need to get rid of this guy JB, and fast, he's drawing too much attention. We don't need to do nothing to JB, okay? I'm gonna win. I'm gonna win. Don't worry, I'm gonna get you your money, somehow. And maybe I can place a bet on tonight's game. [Joey laughing] Sure, you got great credit. Listen pal, we can't take any chances and you should be happy we're doing everything possible to see you're the champ. I wanna make it clear to this putz, that he delivers or he dies! Are we're perfectly... clear on this very simple point? Win or die, putz! Don't you worry about a thing, we're the good fellows here. He won't show up in Friday's top 10, I guarantee it. Keep practicing. "Love Me Tender," "Viva Las Vegas." [chuckling] Hey, I love this shirt. [dramatic music] [Big M] This was starting to feel like a real nightmare. [girls yelling] [soft music] [Big M] The guys were all doing overtime trying to impress the fans. As I pulled up in the limo and saw them there, I felt a glimmer of hope. Big M, you're my man, I love you! [Big M] It started to feel like last year. He's gonna make the finals. [Big M] They still loved me. [women cheering] I still had it. Until he stepped in. JB is awesome! [Big M] It was as if I'd disappeared. They were all over him, and he was just eating it up. [all cheering] But every move was perfection. Good luck, JB, we look forward to seeing you during the duration of the competition. Thank you very much. And the World Crown Elvis event continues its momentum. I'm Lynn Martin reporting from fabulous Las Vegas. Have a rocking, rolling, hunk-a-burning loving afternoon. [soft music] Well, you are the front runner, JB, that's what the latest news flash says. Well, I haven't heard that myself, but I'll take your word for it. Come on, man, this ain't over. When I do "Blue Suede Shoes," it's curtains for all you guys. Forget that, I got a pair of Elvis shoes. I got it from Elvis' Uncle Vester in Graceland. Now if that ain't luck, I don't know what is. I got a pair of shoes at the arena, April 1976, Long Beach. Hey, Big M, what's wrong, where you going, man? You dudes are unbelievable. [Big M]My nerves were on edge. Big Little Joey wasn't fooling around. And while JB seemed so cool, all of the waiting for Linda was really starting to get to him. Excuse me. ♪ Sparked a love Light in my eyes ♪ ♪ Sent on a run ♪ ♪ If I never would have known you ♪ ♪ Don't know what I'd do ♪ - Hey. - [JB] Hey, baby. [dramatic music] Who do you need to call? And old friend in Washington D.C. [Jackie] In the music business? No, the spy business. [phone ringing] Bobby? [chuckling] Is this really you, old friend? It is, you recognize our special password. Well, no one else knew about pelvis hell. But listen to me now, I need your help. I'm down here for just a short time, and some folks in your company have grabbed my daughter. What? A rogue operation in my company? I'm afraid so, can you help? Do you trust me? Of course. Like I said, some things never change. Good, got a pen and paper? [ominous music] [agent 2]Sir, he's on the road driving here now. All right. Too risky to nab him at the hotel, too damn much visibility. You know, the last thing we need is a national scandal. [agent 2] Exactly, sir, that stupid contest. We couldn't get near him. The place is crawling with press. Dammed clever of him. [agent 2] Even now, we'd be smart to let him get back. He's gonna be missed if he doesn't return. Nonsense. Every second he's out there, he's a liability. That may be true, sir, but trust me, keeping him alive and keeping him controlled is gonna be a trick. The car is approaching, but he's not alone, the lovely Agent Messina is in the vehicle. [Vanderbiik] She is most certainly armed. What is she thinking? All units, pull back to lower levels. I repeat, all units to lower levels immediately. We have a code red. [dramatic music] [JB] I gave this to her when she was six. She's kept it all this time. [Messina] I'm sorry, JB, she was here when I left. What happened? We're gonna find her, we're gonna save the fight for another day, let's go. [soft music] We'll try again, JB. Next time, we'll bring in your friends as reinforcements, I'll make some phone calls and see who else we can get on board. Are they gonna hurt her? No, they're not gonna hurt her. They're just trying to intimidate him. [cell phone ringing] Yeah. Stay off the radar. You're persona non grata and helping the enemy. Got it, thanks. How's The King? Oh, he's holding up, we'll talk later. [JB] Who was that? That was just a friend. Next time, when we go in, it'll be on our terms. How? I'm working on that. Don't you have a competition to win? How can you think of that right now? Does it really matter all that much? [Big M] Now, that was when Jackie realized that JB didn't care about winning the contest, he cared about her. [announcer] Coming up next on "The Mona Winters Show," Elvis is in the building. Mona talks to 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition front runner, Mr. John Burrows. [Big M] Suddenly, it seemed like JB was on every channel. He did in a few days what it had taken the rest of us years to achieve. So tell me JB, how long have you been an Elvis impersonator? [JB] A couple years, ma'am, by the way, thank you so much for having me on this show. I know I'm kinda the new boy in town. I see you have a few friends in the champ circuit. [audience applauding] [Mona] What did you do before you were an Elvis impersonator? [JB] I was in production, you know, behind the scenes, ma'am. Unseen hands, so to speak. [Mona] Do you think you'll win the contest? I'm just happy to be singing again, you know, uh, for fans who appreciate my music. Now, some still believe Elvis is alive. [Mona] Do you believe that? [JB] Well, anything is possible, Mona. There are many, many mysteries in heaven and Earth. [Mona] I guess. Well, I wish you luck, JB. I mean, Elvis. That was JB, one of the finalists this week in the 1970's Elvis World Crown Championship. Stay tuned, we'll be right back. [audience applauding] Thank you, JB. [upbeat music] So I don't know, Mickey, you really think I can beat JB? Listen to me, old friend, on Sunday night, you upstage him, simple as that. But he's good, Mickey. He's real good. JB is good, even great, but he's not Elvis, for God sakes. Sometimes, I think he is Elvis. [audience cheering, applauding] Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the semi-finals. Tonight, we have the top 10 finalists right here performing on this stage for you.

Remember, get out there because the tables are always hot and full of excitement. So as always, good luck, and good night. Thank you! [Big M] Now, the mob was sure JB was gonna win that half mil. So as Vegas slipped off into a velvety slumber, Big Little Joey made his plan to deal with JB. And he knew just where to find him. In Jackie Nolan's suite. See ya, Elvis, darling. [Big M] Everybody in town knew about JB and Jackie. Sure, at first, the guys were all up in arms about it, but, the fact was, everybody really did love Jackie. And no one had ever seen her so happy.

And I am so excited to give you the latest on the 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition! [laughing] [Big M] What Elvis didn't know was that Joey put that girl there. - Hey, how ya doing? - You look like. - Can I get your autograph? - You got a paper? I got something for you right here. [Big M] And what Joey didn't know was... the power of Elvis in a biosuit. Ow! [upbeat rock music] [JB] Sorry, honey, I'll just get you that autograph later. - Hey, guys. - We're Homeland Security. We're Homeland Security. [security] What do you work out in Las Vegas? As you know, we have been closely following the dark horse candidate, Mr. John Burrows. Yesterday, I showed you some clips of his electrifying performance. We are all just getting to know this competitor, and finding out about him has turned out to be a lot harder than anyone imagined. My staff has been working overtime trying to find out the 4-1-1 on this fan favorite. For instance, yesterday on "The Mona Winters Show," this is what he had to say when Mona asked John Burrows what he used to do. I was in production, you know, behind the scenes, ma'am. Unseen hands, so to speak. So we got our people on it last night, and here's what we found. We couldn't find out anything about this mystery man. He has no birth certificates, no work record, no graduations, or arrests, or marriages, or photographs. He is a man without a past. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not what we expected to find, but, it is what it is. And we here at "Barry Live!" are committed to bringing the facts to you, our viewing audience. And coming up next, is John Burrows simply the stage name of this man from nowhere, or is it something else? All that and more right after this. ♪ Barry live ♪ [reporter] Tonight on your Vegas News at 11, Elvis is back, now, where can you find him? Local contest makes national news as crowds go crazy for mystery contestant. And the Vegas strip gets a little help from above as UFO sightings are up by 40%. No comment from authorities, all that and more tonight on "Your Vegas News at 11." See you then. [Big M] So that last day, the day of the finals, I was on stage doing the sound check and warming up the band. ♪ Spent my life On the second chances ♪ ♪ Never had much luck On slow romances ♪ After that, me and the guys were hanging out backstage, it had been a long, hard contest. It was actually nice to just be together and let off a little steam. Okay, gonna have us a little hoedown here, huh? Then he found us. ...the way for I want you to do it. Are you crazy? [Big M]I wonder what he thought of all of us there. Okay, okay, Osama been there done that. [Big M]Then he came right into the room with the rest of us. ♪ Hello to the riff From Madame's King ♪ ♪ She said I had him wake up 'Cause I just met a good woman ♪ ♪ Yeah, come on everybody ♪ ♪ A good woman ♪ [cell phone ringing] - Oh, not again. - Oh, excuse me, fellas, - I'll be right back. - [Big M] We didn't know where he was going. Party pooper. I guess I thought it was a girl or something like that. Come on, guys. Turned out it was Linda. It was all about Linda. ♪ A good woman ♪ [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [Big M] You see, just before Elvis went into the service he was staying with his family in Memphis. One night, he and his buddies went to a dance where he met Sally, a young nurse. They really hit it off and they left the dance together. Things got a little outta hand, she was star struck and he was love struck. And before you knew it, they'd gone too far. Problem was she had a guy back home and Elvis was fixing to leave the country. Around six months later, she sent him a letter. She was getting married and there was a baby on the way. She begged him to keep their secret. Now Elvis had a new girl and a career and nothing good could come of telling anyone anything. So, he kept his mouth shut. Linda's daddy died when she was just a little girl. By then, Elvis was married and onto a life of his own. But he always kept tabs on Linda. And her mama sent pictures. She always sent pictures. Then one day, the pictures stopped and he found out that Sally had died. He knew Linda was alone, and he meant to contact her and tell her his story. But fate stepped in and he never had the chance. Now, he was here to make things right. No one was gonna stop him, no one. ♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪ [Barry] So who is this John Burrows, and where did he come from? Some say that, somehow, he really is Elvis Presley, come back to bring us just a little more music. A little more magic, and a little more of his soulful presence which we miss so keenly. Regardless of where he comes from that Mona Winters appearance caused such a run on tickets for tonight's final, they crashed the website. [Barry] So tonight's crowds will be record breaking. And we will all be watching from the biggest room the Sand Hotel and Theater has to offer. The rumors about this instant legend, Mr. Burrows, are surely the reason this contest has become such a media sensation. Usually, each candidate is more than happy to tell us about their life and times, today, we have a man who has nothing to say about himself. [Barry] He simply brings down the house every time he hits the stage. Coming up next, UFO territory, why are there so many sightings around the Nevada desert? If the government knows, why don't they tell us? And if they don't know, why not? Next on "Barry Live!" [upbeat music] [keyboard clicking] [tense music] [tense music continues] I don't understand any of this, who are you people? I wouldn't, Messina. Hello, King. [JB] Bobby. That's right. What's this all about? Two words, son. National security. I don't understand. Your presence here is a real liability. You betrayed me, Bobby. You're one of them. Oh, hell, I've always been one of them. King, look, do you realize the knowledge that you possess? I mean, the people you once knew. Richard Nixon, the whole Vietnam thing. Area 51, and countless clandestine operations. Many of which, are still today, highly classified. You can trust me. I won't say a thing to anybody about anything. Out of my hands, bottom line is, you're here. And now, we'd like you to tell your Roswellian friends that you'll be a good hound dog and head for home. I just need a little bit of time, Bobby. I'm not gonna argue this thing. Either you do as I say, or... well, we've got your little girl. I wanna see her now. Okay. Hi, baby. I don't know you. [somber music] Let's go, JB. [JB] Hi, baby. [Linda] I don't know you. She doesn't know him. [alien] His heart is breaking. [Paulie] Hey, Big M. Hey, Paulie, usual for me, buddy, and whatever my friend here wants. Right away. So... JB. Glad we could have a chance to talk. Who in the hell are you? I've been doing this a long time, a lot longer than the others, and I dedicated most of my life to this, and I ain't never heard of you, son. [Big M] So come on, fess up. And then he told me everything. My name... is Elvis Presley. I was born in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1935. [Big M] He told me about the aliens and the biosuit. He told me about the girl he had met at the dance back in 1959. And the secret they had promised to keep, Linda. She was my life. [Big M] And he told me about how the CIA had kidnapped her, and how he needed to make things right with her before he left. And then he smiled when he told me about falling in love with Jackie and how people here on Earth had really come through for him. Like Agent Messina, and Sonny, and The Rock. He knew he didn't have much time. He knew he was risking his life. If he didn't get back to the ship in time, the biosuit would fail, and Elvis would die. Still, he was happy because a crew of friends were on their way to help him get Linda back. People that he loved and that loved him. Hey, Sonny. Holy mother of Memphis, it's Sonny West. How would you like to go on a little adventure of goodwill with me? What kind of adventure, King? Oh, one that involves a little old fashioned butt kicking. Like the old days. Hey, all right. Some butt kicking, count me in, huh? - Hey, guys, count me in, too. - [chuckles] Let's go, baby. Yeah, oh... Sonny West. Oh, I can't believe it, it's Sonny West. Hey, grandma. [Big M] So off we all went in a caravan trying to get to the CIA base and back before that night's final round. Of course, we didn't get far before... [siren blaring] The thing was, JB didn't have a license. Or any record of even existing, for that matter. If this cop were to radio back to headquarters Messina knew the cat would be outta the bag for sure. Low roll the windows, please. What's the problem, officer? What do we have here, an early Halloween party? Officer, I'm a federal agent. We need to be on our way. All right. Drive safe. And don't be cruel. - Thank you, sir. - Oh, yeah. Thank you very much. [Big M] Agent Messina was as cool as they come. [upbeat music] He's left the contest? Are you sure? Who the hell are you? Come on, baby, we're outta this joint. Not so fast, King. [JB] Hi, Bobby. King, you're mine now, and you are not getting out of this one easily. [electricity surging] Oh shit. [JB] Come on. - [grunting] - [groaning] [grunts] JB, we gotta get down to the finals, boy, 'cause if we're a no show, they're gonna disqualify us. I got some unfinished business to take care of. I will catch up with you later, Big M. All right. but don't you be late, 'cause, uh... if I'm gonna get beat out by anybody, it's gonna be The King. It's gonna be an honor. [JB] Big M, I really appreciate everything you've done, you and the boys. Shucks, we ain't done nothing but... Thank you. Thank you very much. [light music] So what now? I really have to go now. [dramatic music] Let's go, Jackie. The buffet is still open. I'll take you there. [audience cheering, applauding] And now, ladies and gentlemen, our first performer in the final category is Big El. ♪ They say love is blind ♪ ♪ I saw you the first time ♪ ♪ But I can't go along Believing your lies ♪ ♪ You are not Miss Innocent anymore ♪ ♪ You are not Miss Innocent ♪ ♪ Falsely accusing me To cover the real score ♪ ♪ You are not Miss Innocent ♪ ♪ Anymore ♪ [soft music] [Big M] I know they had a long way to go to get back to the ship, hours, and Elvis was in bad shape. [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [Big M] When they finally got back to the site he was so weak he could barely stand. [instruments beeping] Well, I guess this is it, Sonny, just for now though. Well, at least this time, I got to say goodbye, boss. - [Rock] Yeah. - You sure did. [smooches] Rock. You're The King. I love ya, bro. [dramatic music] [heart beating] [instruments beeping] Ladies and gentlemen, Big M. [Big M] I made it back in the nick of time. And had the show of my life. ♪ Oh, girl ♪ ♪ Be my baby tonight ♪ ♪ The whole world ♪ ♪ Be my baby tonight ♪ [inaudible] [dramatic music] Messina. I really wanna thank you for everything you've done. You've really been a good friend. Well, you deserved a second chance, JB. Thank you. - [instruments beeping] - [heart beating] [dramatic music] Thank you, thank you so very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to announce that Mr. John Burrows is not able to do his final set. - [audience booing] - [Barry] So, um, stay calm, stay calm for just a minute. Now listen, unfortunately, due to strict contest rules, he is in default, and therefore is disqualified from the competition. But what we're gonna, just stay, stay, hold on, what we're gonna do is we're just, hold on! Could you get off? Hey, hey, get! [crowd clamoring] I'm not ever gonna see you again, am I? Never? Don't ever say never, honey. [crying] Okay, now listen to me. I've gotta go somewhere right now where nobody can follow, not even you, baby doll. [JB] But Agent Messina over there and the boys will take care of you, okay? [dramatic music] [JB] I love you, honey. Remember, I'll be out there forever. I'll always love you. [suspenseful music] He can't make it. Help him. Help him. [dramatic music] [audience applauding] Thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Now that was exciting and that's what Las Vegas is all about. So now, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of tonight's 1970's Elvis World Crown Competition is... [drum roll] The Big M! [audience cheering, applauding] [engines roaring] [dramatic music] Thank you all, thank you all. This is for you, JB. Wherever you are. [whooshes] [upbeat music] Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, right after the contest, police swarmed the theater and quickly apprehended our wining contestant Big M. With half a million dollars as motive, he is the cheap suspect in the disappearance of contest favorite, Mr. John Burrows. With no evidence to speak of, police will have to let it go. [Barry] Big M says he's innocent, claiming aliens are to blame.
