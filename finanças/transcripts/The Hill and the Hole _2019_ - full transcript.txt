[music] Just let me get this call. [phone rings] Just let me get this fucking call, man. [door slams] [footsteps] [door opens] [music] Oh, would you fuck a duck? [engine revving] [truck driving] Yeeehaw! [music] [wind whistling] [music] [truck on dirt road] [door opens] [door shuts] [music] [man breathing] That's a pretty cool plane. Thank you. Your mother or father around? I didn't think so. You'd better hurry. Sky's gonna open up soon. You know, I've always liked that expression. Can I help you with something? You sure can. Can you tell me what that is out there? Oh, that old thing. Daddy doesn't want anyone going near it. He doesn't want them to fall in. To fall in? [insects chirping, wind] [metal clattering] [wind rustling] That's not right at all. Scope busted? Must be. [dog howling, wind] [truck on gravel] [truck doors slamming] [footsteps, wind, howling] Well, hello there, gentlemen. Look at that motherfucker, Gabe, shit eating grin. You mind telling me what you're doing on my land? Well, it appears Uncle Sam's got me filling in on surveying duties today. Surveying, Gabe? Charting out the boundaries-- The land-- Of the neighboring reservation-- Again? Actually just measuring that last feature over there. Then I'm gone. Thing is my readings are all off on it, so I've got to take another look at it. Seems to form the northeastern boundary. Is that right? You fellas been shooting trap or something? The neighbor's fucking dogs. [man sighing] Fellas, honest, there's nothing to worry about here. To be straight, I'm just an archeologist with the Bureau of Land Management. BLM. Fuck, Gabe. This isn't even really my thing. If you're a fed, let me see some ID. Sure thing. Easy. Thank you. So as I was saying, what we're trying to determine here is where-- You ain't the first that's been sent out here. You know that right? Oh no? And what happened? The other guy just didn't take a look at that. [man yelling] Come on, man, hey, hey, hey-- Why the hell did you do that-- I had to. [mumbling] Come on. [music] [insects chirping] You fucked up, Michael. You fucked him up, and you fucked up. They're all gonna be over here now. Gabe, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do with him? [insects chirping] Let's just get him in the truck. And then what? Gabe, and then what? You're not gonna take him into town, are you? Gabe. My daddy is going to kill you. [man gasping] He will. He'll take you out into the field and flatten your head while you're still breathing. Gabriel. There's a shit storm coming our way. Get up on that hill over yonder. They'll protect you. [man breathing] [insects chirping] Goddammit. Goddammit. Mother. [music, footsteps] Get back here. [music, footsteps] Hey. [music, yelling, footsteps] Stop. Stop. [music, footsteps] [man panting] Shit. Give me a break here. [man panting] [music] [plastic clattering] No, no, no, no. No. [music] [music, truck on dirt road] [chirping] [music] And there's Orion's Belt. You can see it now, known as the Three Sisters, and if you follow where it's pointing deep into the heart of the constellation Taurus, up there, Taurus's brightest star Aldebaran. [truck on dirt road] [car engine running] Hey, Mr. D.U.I.? There are children here. Hey, here's an idea. Call your podunk PD, would you? [music] Shit on a Pringle. [music] [door opens] [man panting] [music] [bell ringing] Someone wanna give me a room, huh? How about room service? Just need a stupid, goddamned phone. [music] [mechnical noise] [truck pulling up] [doors slamming] This guy can't be that stupid, can he? Little bitch run off on foot? I don't know. Got the feeling that guy might be that stupid. [door opening] [metal clattering] Closed for the season. Closed for eternity. This place has been shut down for years now. Let's make sure, huh? It's your fucking man. You do it. Fuck you. There something wrong with the sky, like there's one star too many? [man chewing] [man burping] So you say you were just doing your job. I'm just doing my job. You were saying? Just doing my job. Hey, can I get some sugar over here? Sure can, sugar. And so all these good old boys, they try to find some cause to take umbrage with your trespassing on their land? Just a small farm. I don't even know if they own the place, but they came at me and... Hey, where did I park my truck? Have you seen my truck? Easy. It's outside the motel. The motel. Right. [man sniffling] [man sighing] So now, you say you found something out there. Yes. I... Ben, how are my girls? Tom. Girls? What girls? I had three beautiful girls once upon a time. Oh, them. That was a long time ago, Tom. They're not your girls anymore. Need some help here. Ben, need your help, old buddy. [man yelling] [man grunting] [music] [footsteps] Get up. Get up, and get out. Oh, it's you. This is not whatever you wanted to use it for. Yeah, I was just looking for a good book actually, but-- Baloney. What the hell are you doing out here? I'm just testing the firmness of your steps here for inquiring loiterers and gentlemen of leisure. Hey, hold on. I got to make a phone call. I lost my wallet, my phone. Please. [footsteps] Not a phone booth, not a public bathroom. This is a library. So who does one see about getting a card? No, really, I just need to call into my office. Your office? What are you, a professional drifter? I'm an archeologist actually. Usually I'm much less injured. [footsteps] [man grunting] Okay, Dr. Jones, there's still a landline phone in the community area downstairs. Use it, and leave. That'll do, Marion. How's this look? Like it hurts. [man sighs] Hope you recognize my voice, Ben. It's been a few years. I've just called to make sure my girls are doing okay, and, right now I'm out at a small town in the northern part of the state. I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing here, but I think I might need your help. I think I might have found something. [footsteps] Hi, Layne. Hi, Joel. How you doing? It's a beautiful morning outside. Yeah? You don't look like you slept much last night. [man chuckling] In fact, looks like you got a little something there, a little love bite-- Oh, (mumbling). Someone new? Hush on that Layne. Anyhow. Yes. Did I see you last night out on the rim? Out on the rim? Sure did. I was out there with my little stargazers. Oh, yeah. Gonna give these poor kids a little culture around here. Yeah. You were out there too. Yeah, just romping around with Gabe and Mike. Hey, you didn't happen to see a guy out there, did you, on your nature hike? We got some calls about a strange man outside Gabe's old ranch. Strange man, huh? He might have had a slight injury to the head right here. No? No. All right, well, I'll see you around. [mumbling] You should go outside. You call those police yet? You need to go. Oh, are we back on this again? I know where you can find what you're looking for. Just ask me. Oh, you became a real Forward Frank, didn't you? [metal clattering] [music] [man breathing] This hill is a hole, Wolcraftson. [wood thudding] [wood creaking] I heard someone down there. Not you? Downstairs? No, what are you talking about? I should get this thing checked out. That's likely the smart money. Did you make your call? You keep all the town records here, surveys and such? Everything's up to date? Actually, yeah. The town hall basement flooded a few years ago, so everything's over here now. You know your records are incomplete. Well, that's not really my job. No, but it's sort of mine. Come on. I'll give you a lift. The clinic's just outside town. [footsteps] It's a nice little town you got here. How do you do it? People stick around. Not like most places, I guess. What? Nothing. Wow, really don't like you. [man chuckling] Where are all your churches? Hadn't seen a single one downtown. Is that what's missing from our records, churches? 'Cause of course we've had churches. We just ran out of people. I mean, I wouldn't know. I never went to church anyhow. You know anything about that hill on the Caster farm? Hill? There's a giant relief of it in your library. Oh, yeah, of course. The mound, it's a local thing. It's, what do you call it? A mascot. - Well, it's gone from the record, just a blank spot on the survey. It's like it doesn't even exist. I've never seen anything like it. That doesn't compute. That's got to be some kind of mistake. I mean, that thing has been here forever. Had to assume so, but there have been at least nine other previous surveys. Nine? Yeah, one by a Wolcraftson, and the others all signed off by a Roger Person. [woman laughing] Roger? I guess. What? Oh, you're kidding me. (laughing) Roger? What? It's got to be some kind of joke. Why? He does this sort of thing. He's always monkeying around the town. But he must work for the Bureau like me. I mean, those documents are legit. I mean, I think he retired here a few years ago, but now he sells snacks down at the little league field down the road, and he'll probably be there tonight for the games. Geez, Roger. (laughing) Man, whatever he did really fooled you good, huh? [music] [engine screeching, rumbling] [car approaching] Hey, are you okay? I'm all right. Man, what'd I hit? I don't know. Threw a rod. I don't (mumbling). Should have called these guys in the first place. Okay, you need to go. What did you say? I said get out of here now- What I need to do is talk to this nice patrolman here. Layne. You know this asshole-- Don't let him go. No, don't let him go, Layne. [footsteps] Goddammit. Stop, sir. I just want to help. Too late for that, Barney Fife. I'll have your badge. Stop. [man yelling] This is ridiculous. [man panting] [mumbling] He's not trying to kill me, he's a cop. [man panting] Why would he want you dead? What the fuck. [man grunting] He's a cop. He doesn't want you dead. Fucking trying to kill you. He's trying to kill. [footsteps] [footsteps] [man panting] - Joel? [mumbling] Can you get up? You're scaring me. Are you hurt? [man grunting] Joel? Stop that. Joel, can you stop that? Stop it. Stop it. Please stop it. [shrill music] [chirping, wind] [footsteps] [crowd noise] What are you doing, mister? Shhh, I'm just gonna surprise my friend, so help me out and be quiet. I can't hear you. You're whispering. A surprise. A surprise? Yes, now help me out. Don't give me away. Okay, is that your friend's truck? Shhhh, yes. That's a big truck. - Yes, it is, now shhhh. That's his truck. Here he comes. Hey, where'd your daddy go? Your friend wanted to surprise you. My friend? What friend is that? He had a scar on his head, and he went that way. Really. [footsteps] Hey, dudes. Anybody know where a guy could score some funnel cake around here? Oh my god. That way. Much appreciated. Don't do drugs, guys. [footsteps] [organ music] Don't you have a wife and kids or something? Shit, no. You kidding me? Kids, sure, but married? No. I mean, not that that doesn't interest me, but you should get out of here. I'll come find you later. Oh, you'll come find me, huh? I got to talk to my friend, baby. Yeah, why don't you screw him instead? Shit. Hey, any word from Joel? Nah, he'll be here soon. He's here. I haven't seen him. No, our guy. He wouldn't come here. Yes, he would. He did. He's here. He's long gone, Gabe. He ran back with his tail between his legs. Hey-- Don't worry. We'll take care of it-- Get the shit out of your ears. He's here. Where then? Having a fried Twinkie shoved up his ass? Why the fuck would he stay? I don't know, but he did. He talked to your daughter. My daughter? I just need to talk to him. You said he spoke to my daughter? Apparently. I'll murder that motherfucker where he stands. Listen, we're just gonna scare him. That's all. Isn't that your girl over there, Library Layne? [footsteps] [punk rock music] [knocking] Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, guy. Hold on, hold on. We got line of customers here. We can't be letting you jump in front of everybody else, so you're gonna have to wait in line. That's okay, Tiny. I don't think this gentleman's here to indulge in our delicacies. By the way, that's a nasty gash you got there. Given state health code, I'd steer clear of the frying vats, so what can I do you for? You Roger, Roger Person? Sure, why not? Roger Person with the Bureau of Land Management? It's ancient history, man. Back in my day, we were known as the Bureau of Lonely Men. I contract as an archeologist. Oh, good for you. Your parents must be proud. I'd like to ask you some questions about the town records. Your surveys are incomplete. These are highly irregular hours. Why don't you come back, say, Tuesday? Plan to get a jump on a weekend bender and duck out of here early. Do you know anything about 'them'? 'Them'? Just 'them'. Geez, this is circuitous. Why don't we go someplace else? [metal whirring] Right this way, pal. Step into my office. [metal whirring] Can't we go somewhere a little less conspicuous? No one's paying us any attention up here. No thanks. I've got little girls I'd like to see grow up. [lighter clicking] [insects chirping] What do you think of the game? Those kids are pretty good, huh? Yeah, nice little town you got here, one of the last remaining. Wouldn't be surprised if it were one big cult. It is one big cult, all of them, every single one, even the kids. You're kidding. You're serious? These people seem so, what's the word? Normal? Yeah, a bunch of providential natalists. That's why there's so many of them. They keep popping them out to keep the faith going. Going where? Where the hell is anything going? Just round and round and back to the ground. We all come from the earth and like fools reach out to the stars, searching for what? Eternal life, the stairway to heaven? When it's all said and done, we end up right back where we started, in the good old Mother Earth 10 feet under, just more food for the gods to take in and spit out and start this whole fucked up cycle all over again, but you probably didn't travel all this way just to hear all my philosophical horse shit, did you? You got that right. What happened to the records, Roger? Records were fudged, maybe to keep you boys out of here, keep them out of reach of the long arm of the law. Well, that didn't work. No, it didn't. State kept coming. So I guess I caught you in a fib there. I guess you did. I read another name on the survey, Wolcraftson. Wolcraftson, oh, that son of a, where did you get his name? I'm a bookish sort. Wolfcraftson was my illustrious predecessor. Died of a heart attack, as I recall, and on that ranch, I think. He died on the Caster farm? Something like that. Wolfcraftson made the only complete survey. I've got the original right here in my pocket. Only thing is, Wolfcraftson was wrong. He put the top of that hill 100 feet underground. That's not something that just happens. Some alternative science might explain it. No. Roger, Wolcraftson and I got the same readings. That hill is reading out as one big hole. [gravel crunchng] Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let me go. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I just want to talk, okay? I mean it, Gabe. There's something happening here, and I don't know what it means, but there's something wrong. Hey, hey, hey, hey, you know that guy up there? Layne, he talk to you? He talk to you, Layne? It was you. You did that to him, huh, beat him up like that? [footsteps] A misunderstanding. Oh, a misunderstanding. Oh, it's always a misunderstanding with you, isn't it? That's not fair. What's not fair? You don't know what I know. That damn farm, you don't even live on it anymore. You're alone. You're gonna be alone. [metal whirring] Blame Manifest Destiny. It swept right through here, and all the original people and any knowledge they left behind, everything got burned or excavated right down to the ground. Those things left standing, they had to survive somehow, right? It forced them to get weird. That hill on the Caster farm, that one's a survivor. - So it's man-made. I knew it. Can we talk about who they are, the builders? They? [man yelling] Fuck your face. Get out of here, geek. [man yelling and grunting] [dirt crunching] [muffled grunting] Hey, have you seen Joel? What? Hey, where is he? Just don't go up there, okay? Don't, don't, don't go. Hey. Michael is up there. I'm telling you don't go. [metal whirring] [footsteps] [man grunting] Sh, sh, we got to talk. I just want to talk. We need to clear the air. Sh, are we gonna talk, or am I gonna have to do something? [man panting] We're going to wait for my partner. That's what we're going to do, and we're gonna have a chat, the three of us. Nice night, lots of stars out, huh? Those friends of yours? You call your fed boys on me? Fuck you, dick. Gabe don't get here soon- I'm going to take some next steps, and it'll be all over the back of your fucking head. Stay right there, or I'll do something about it. [man grunting] Fuck, what is that? What is that? [shrill music] Michael? Get off the ground. What are you doing out there? You let him go? You shouldn't have done that. Michael, get up. Now we have to go get him. Michael, are you listening? Michael. [man yelling[ Come on, Michael. Get up. [man grunting] Come on, Michael. [man growling] [man panting] What was that out there? I can take you to see them if you want. Them? But you got to get cleaned up and put on a tux. A what? You happen to be in luck. I keep extras in my truck. [man panting] [footsteps] [rock music] I can't find Cassiopeia, and that's an easy one. It's out my window over there. Oh, yeah. Then we're headed northeast toward the reservation? Is that where we're going, or is it a surprise? We're gonna crash a little party. That's all. Surprise. I lied about Wolcraftson. Yeah? Is that all you lied about? He may have died of a broken heart, but not heart failure. He was one sad, lonely fuck. Aren't we all? He died up on that hill itself. Got so frustrated with his observations, he decided to walk up on that thing and be sure about it. Then what? The strain of it all got to him? Medical examiner said natural causes, but that didn't explain the clay they found in his lungs. [rock music] [car engine running] Potluck, oh, boy, and I didn't bring a thing. Now your name is Tom Digby. That is my name. You're a junior deacon with our brother lodge in Sacramento, California, and I've invited you to join our meeting here tonight. I'm the chaplain, by the way. Hold on, Roger. It's the only way you're gonna see anything. Just how's my tux look? [footsteps] Master Person. Brother Marx, this is Junior Deacon Digby, Sacramento Lodge. Junior Deacon Digby. Greetings from Earth. [footsteps] I got this kid. He's climbing the drapes. He thinks he's freaking King Kong, but the worst part about it is he's using the cat as Fay Wray. He's driving me out of my mind. Would you look who it is? Hey, Roger. Thanks, Zeke. What about our brother here? Nah, he's a teetotaler. This is Tom, Tom from Sack of Potatoes. Tom the teetotaler. That's me. I wouldn't dream of touching the stuff. Tom's an archeologist, and a damn good one at that. Well, my stars and garters. You fellows are sure a fun bunch. Tom's an old colleague of mine. Can't be that old. You have a few decades on him, Roger. He's like the pathetic, overgrown son I never had. This joker here taught me everything I know. Taught you everything you know. Since when did you study archeology, Roger? Archeology? That's funny men running around looking for their mommies. That's mummies. Brought old Tom here to see our box. Our box? Oh, right. I mean, we're all curious, aren't we? You mean? Exactly. We do have a nice box. We have a wonderful box. Well, lead the way. Come with me. [footsteps] [music] Who's the engineer? That would be me. Some nice work in here. Thanks, Tom. You're too kind. And that must be our box? No, not yet. This is what we call the Chamber of Reflection, kind of a time out room for confused men-children. We keep things in there to get things cooking, kind of open the third eye a little bit, sort of old hat for the Order these days, but it used to be all the rage. I bet this one is special. Very special. [door creaks open] The light doesn't turn on until I close the door, a little stage effect for you rookies. Want to get inside? Okay. [door slams] Hey, no light, no light. You asked to see them. That's one of them there. [gasping] Fuck, Roger, you asshole. It was pulled from the Caster farm, buried near the mound. The excavation stopped soon after, needless to say. Feds were notorious for rat holing remains like these. They didn't get ours, by God. Local lodge boys boiled that thing down and stashed them away down here. Have anything to say to Mr. Bones there? He's massive. This is insane. I've never seen anything like it. What were they? Hominid, sub-species, I believe. According to legends, they were giant cannibals, baleful sorcerers demanding blood sacrifice, ye titans of old. Why would the government want to hide away something like him? It's amazing. Same reason that BLM had me deliberately fudging surveys for decades. Deliberately fudging? Yeah, you didn't think I was a free agent, did you? But that doesn't make any sense. Why would they send me out here to fix the surveys, let alone nine other surveyors before me, nine of them? Aside from Wolfcraftson, who are those nine other guys? Roger? Hey, Roger? Roger, open up. Open up, Roger. Hey, open up. (metal tapping) Open up, Roger. Easy now. You haven't seen the botch yet-- Open the fucking door, Roger-- You still got to see the botch-- Open up. [man coughing and panting] And while many of our so called peers are not prepared for some of this thinking yet, the wider community has been quite receptive, especially given the public's overwhelming support, and, as you know, hearts and minds. [footsteps] [throat clearing] Continuing on, the future, gentlemen, [plastic clicking] is the past, and that makes the past, yes, you guessed it, the future, and we are its stewards. It's really an exciting time for the future and the past if you stop to think about it. - You disgusting, backwards fat heads. This new paradigm for stupidity that you're advancing here, it's an insult to everything for which I, for which we, spent decades of our lives in training. Mr. Digby, please. We're merely entertaining new sources of-- Cashola! To save your flailing museums, your careers? Well, I've got two words for that. Up yours, signed Tom Digby. Damn you, Digby. You have just autographed your resignation from this institution in the most ridiculous fashion possible. [man panting] [metal whirring] [wood knocking] Hey, we got to lock it up now. Can I just stay for a little while? I don't really want to go out there. Okay, just a bike lock on the outside. I'm not really worried about anyone cleaning us out of Roger's special dough or anything. What's in that special dough? What's in that dough indeed. [dirt crunching] [metal whirring] [woman gasping] Ms. Mead? Ms. Mead, are you okay? Yeah, are you okay? Yeah, are you okay? (mumbling) Yes, I'm okay. [metal whirring] I'm okay. [footsteps] Geez, it's so late. Where are all of your parents? Are we safe out here? I don't know. Are we? [dirt crunching] [music] Open her up. [man yelling] Oh, look who it is. Brother Ignatius, hasn't made a lodge meeting in 15 years. [truck engine] Never done it like this, Rodge. Needs to be a willing sacrifice, pure. There's a quarter million ways to skin a cat. You want to deal with the fallout if we miss snack time for those things? [truck engine] Rez police, Rodge. Aw, fuck a duck. [tires screeching, police siren] Tom, wake up. [man gasping] [man panting] Well, would you look at that? Benjamin Shelley. Hey, sit back, Tom. (man panting) Are we inside a box? We're inside Reservation PD. I've been calling around town all night looking for you. I guess I got lucky when I called out here. [man panting] They said they found you in what looked like a prop coffin on the road. Jesus, Tom, what have you been doing? You got my phone call. Yes, that's why I'm here. You can tell me all about it on the way back to Frisco. We've got a long drive, okay? [ominous music] How are the girls? The girls are fine. You've been keeping an eye on them? 'Course I have. It's been a long time. I have some photos in my wallet. You really have been keeping an eye on them, huh? No, they don't need me to, really. Their mother's got everything tied up pretty neatly over there. She must hate me. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she hates you. They're so big. I mean, I didn't realize. It's a good thing they have Betsy's looks. They're great kids, Tom. [man breathing] [ominous music] Ben, look. Look, it's her. Turn this car around now. [music] No, no. Sorry about that, Zeke, little buddy. We all got personal sacrifices to make for the greater good. That's what public service is all about. That's why I make my special cakes, sprinkle a little melon dust on them. I'll make this whole town a sacrifice. [dirt crunching] [wood clattering] Laynie, Laynie. What? What are you doing here? Laynie, you're trespassing. Hey, hey, I said get off my land. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I said stop. You're not very convincing. Shhhhh, look all you want. Just don't go up there. [insects buzzing] [man grunting] Oh my god, Gabriel. Gabriel. [woman gasping] It appears we've been had. What? Roger get help. He needs help. Oh. [mumbling] Oh, what did you do? Did what I had to do. He didn't see what I saw. Had to put him in a time out like pretty boy over there. No, no, he wasn't, was he? He was doing just that. But he wouldn't. He wouldn't. He's so good. Lucky thing for you I was out trolling the woods this morning. You both might get to mean something, small as it seems. [loud whack] [man panting] Oh, there's a lot of blood here. Head laceration, but the pulse is still okay. This fucker deserves a good laceration. Yeah, no signal. I can't call for help around here, man. Well, would you look at that? I'll get up on that thing now, and you tell me. Is it what I think it is? [man groaning] What did you do? You drew me out. You tricked me out here. What's gonna happen to him? That man is a dead man. He's already dead. [music] Laynie, stop. You don't know what I know. [music, wind] You fucknuts tried to get the drop on me, did you? Whoever tries will be the first fucker that dies. You got that? [shrill music] [man spitting] Oh, what'd you do, you dumb ass? You're gonna get us all fucked. Guess I better take it in my own hands, open up the star gate, and toss your scrawny ass in. No, Roger, don't. [man choking] Well, you asked for them. Here they be. Yeehaw, come and get them, cowboys. It's chow time. [man choking] No, that ain't right. That's your guy right there, clean cutted and good to go. Them's some choice cuts, boys. Dig in. Come on. No, not me. Wolcraftson's the one you wanted. [man screaming] [shrill music] Aw, shit. [shrill music] [man choking] [shrill music] [man coughing] [childrens' laughter] [man breathing] Tom, Tom Digby. Take me home. [music] Hey, Tom, Tom. Could you wait a minute? I see you packed up your desk. Yeah, I'd like to put two or three states between me and those pinheads before sundown, you know? Is there any way at all that I can talk you into staying? [man sighing] Just don't let those guys turn this into some crusty peepshow, huh? Tom, you belong in a museum. I really don't know what to make of that.
