Oh God. God! You're doing it again. Huh? Think you could say something else? Sorry. Stay inside me. That was the last time, okay? Every time's the last time with you. Me, I always look forward to the next time. Saturday? No, I'm serious. I've gotta stop, besides, I can't Saturday. Why not? Martha and I are going to her mother's, remember, on Saturday? How could I forget? I'm sorry. I've gotta go now, I've got a lot to do. Okay, but it's a long walk back to that car. Oh, come on. Get up, huh? All right. Hey. You ever notice that that woman's always doing laundry when we're in here? It's a wonder she has any. It's not like there's ever any guests. That's my point. I think she's listening in on us. Great. Seriously. I can tell by the way she looks at us. The nosy bitch. I bet she can see in here. I bet that's a two-way mirror. Nah. You think so? Come on, Veronica. We gotta go, we can't be late. I gotta go to Martha, God help me. Oh, I am terribly sorry, Mr. Serrick. That's quite all right. Not a problem. Have a good day. That woman is such a freak. Yeah, I know, but she's one of God's children, Veronica. I don't think so. What was that she called you, anyway? Serrick. It's the name I register under, Frank Serrick. You know, just in case anyone should ever snoop around, or I don't know. Oh brother. One of these days you're gonna burn down a mountain, you know that? At least I have something to print in the paper. Yeah, your beautiful picture. Well, that'd be a trip, wouldn't it? Yeah. You're such a little girl, you know that? Is that a problem? Not yet. So, maybe I'll call you at home later? Funny, real funny. Okay, then I'll see you on Sunday. Can't wait. Hey, guys! - Hey, squirt. - Hey, Dad. Have a good day? Did you catch anything? Nah, not today, Son. Can I go with you next time? Yeah. Yeah, maybe next time. Cool. Hey, give me the ball. Hip, hip, hip, ready! You gotta practice more, Son. Hi. Hi. Get lucky? Excuse me? You were fishing. Not so, the fish could tell. Oh. Miss Dow called. Really, what for? Edgar's falling behind again. She wants us out to the school to discuss what his problem might be. His problem is that he's several bricks shy of a load. That's a terrible thing to say about your own Son. He's not my Son. In the eyes of the Lord he is. Oh, no. No, he's not. Prick. Frank. I love you. So much. I love you. From the lips dripped with honey. Whoa. In the end she is bitter as wormwood. How's your homework coming, Edgar? Finished. Time for bed. Ah, but I don't wanna go to bed. Come on, honey. Come on. It's time. But Daddy promised he'd read me a story. I don't think Daddy's got any stories in him tonight. That's okay. He could tell me an old one. Like when he was just a kid and the boy got drownded in the lake. You don't wanna hear that one again. Aw. Come on, it's okay. Mommy'll tell you a story. Let's go. - Now, go brush your teeth. - Okay. I would not listen to those who tried to teach me now I've come to nearly every kind of misery in the assembly and in the community. I don't think I can take much more of this. Then leave. Find joy with the wife you married in your youth. Her is the love that ever holds you captive. So attractive. Do you know, I haven't been with a man in a long time now, four years. Ah, pardon my greeting card sentiment, but I've started to think about you in that special way. Oh, you have the most beautiful eyes. Really? Oh, no. Oh, you're too kind. Mm, and that thing you wear around your neck. You just have this ethereal quality about you. And the little boy unbolted his wings and flew off, far out to sea, circling high above whales, and sharks, and dolphins. He was free. Goodnight, sweetheart. Shh, don't talk. I'm ready now. I'm ready, Frank. Oh, God, am I ready. Take me now. Hello. Hello? Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach. Yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. And Jesus said unto them, "Children, have you any fish?" They answered him, "No." He said to them, "Cast your net on the right side "of the boat and you shall find some." And so they cast their net on the right side of the boat, and now were unable to haul it in for the quantity of fish. Daddy sure loves fish. Said unto Peter, "It is I, the Lord." When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his clothes. For he was stripped for work, and sprang into the sea. Name of the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. - Amen. - Amen. Reverend Paul, your sermon today was so beautiful. Well, thank you. There's something that I've been wanting to ask you. My dog, Dexter, died recently. And I was wondering, do you think that we will go to the same heaven, or is there a separate heaven for dogs? I guess I can ask my mom. Okay, why don't you just tell me a time? I'm sorry, I disappeared there for a minute, Trish. I guess my mind's slipping, as you were saying, I'm sorry. Do you think Dexter and I will go to the same heaven? Yes, of course you will. Ah, thank you very much for coming. - Thanks so much Reverend. - Okay, Trish. Miss Keller. Hey, James. Reverend Keller. - Miss Dow. - Reverend. When am I gonna see you, Paul? Ah, let's discuss this later, shall we? - When, Paul? - Thank you, Reverend. Ah, we'll talk at the picnic. Oh, are you going to be there? Yes, of course I'm going to be there. I'll be judging the pie contest. Thank you very much for coming, Miss Dow. Reverend. Mabel. You're judging the pie contest again. Obviously. I don't suppose there's any chance I may win this year? Hey, if memory serves me correctly, you took the blue ribbon in '93? Yes. And back then you said my cherries was sweet as sin. They were. But since then, I've developed a taste for peach. Have a great day. You have beautiful eyes. He is such a prick. What do you mean? Don't bother getting all gooey-eyed over him. He's screwing Miss Dow, the school teacher. I'd like to invite you and your husband to the school on Tuesday night. I'm a little concerned about Edgar, he's acting up. Miss Dow, I'm sure Edgar's behavior would improve if he could just get a little more attention from his father. He's desperate for Paul's approval and I can't seem to get- - The Reverend isn't Edgar's real Father, is he? How did you know that? Well, I've just seen his records. Edgar's my son. My first husband died. Well, I guess I'm just gonna go and get a refill. Beautiful day. I think the Reverend had something to do what that. You and the Reverend, are you planning to have any more? Oh. - I'd love to have another baby. - Yeah? I'd love to have a little girl. I don't know how Paul feels about that. How can you talk to her? You do, don't you? As little as possible. You know what the worst part is? The worst part is I really like her. She's a nice woman. You okay? We're not far from where Frank Serrick drowned. One minute we were horsing around, and then the next, Frank went under and never came up. I'm sure he's in heaven. Perhaps. Maybe we'll go to the grave site sometime, hmm? Get some flowers. Veronica, there is no grave. They never found the body. You mean it's still in there? Yeah. Come on. Let's get back before anyone notices. Good afternoon, Mr. Serrick. Afternoon. You look very pretty today. Thank you. Oh, Paul. Oh, God! God! You're doing it again. Sorry. This was the last time, right? I know you find all of this terribly amusing, but I am a man of the cloth. And that fact implies certain moral responsibilities which I'm not exactly living up to here. You know what your problem is, Paul? No, tell me, please. At heart, you're a fuckin' square. Great. Thank you. What's the matter with me? If Momma could see me now shacked up at some motel fucking a hippie. I am not a hippie. I wish I were dead. Yeah, well, I wish Martha were dead. Martha didn't do anything wrong. I'm the one who's guilty. Guilty of what? Of loving me? Is that such a sin? You do love me, don't you? What if I were. Huh? What if I were dead? Or rather, what if it looked like I were? What? You mean like stage an accident? Yeah, maybe. But there'd have to be a corpse, wouldn't there? Not necessarily. I don't know. If you really thought we could get away with it. I already told you I could. You're so cold, you know that? My sister told me I was crazy for getting involved with a married man. But I thought, hey, he's a pastor, at least he'll treat me nice. You told your sister? For Christ sake, Paul, she lives in Michigan. Honest to God, like the least compassionate man I know. Do you think this is easy for me? You say jump and I'm just supposed to walk away from my whole life? And not even get like half an hour to think about it? Well, I guess this is it, huh? I didn't say that, Paul. I just need time to think. I'll call you later. He's sullen, he's hostile, and whenever I try to get him to participate he just shuts down. He gets very cold. I don't know what we should do. What do you think, Reverend? Well, I think he's surrounded by too many women pulling him this way and that. And perhaps what he really needs is to be left alone and given some space to breathe. So it's my fault. If the shoe fits, wear it. Hey, we're not here to blame each other. We're here to figure out what's best for Edgar. Right? Yes, that's right. Reverend. Do you agree? Of course I agree, Miss Dow. I like her. - Who? - Miss Dow. I do. I think she's a good teacher for you. Yeah. Oh. I forgot my coffee mug. At the schoolhouse? Well, I tell you what. Why don't you put pardner here to bed, and I'll be more than happy to go back and get it for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thanks. Bye, Dad. Goodbye, Son. Can we have a story before bed? Okay, just one. I thought about your idea. And? What do you want me to do? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Just wait for me to call. I mean Frank. When will that be? The less you know, the better. Paul. Must you talk? It's kind of exciting, isn't it? I didn't mean to wake you. I'm sorry. I'm not. I'll make coffee. Great, thanks. You gonna be gone all day? No, I gotta get back early to write tomorrow's sermon. You could take Edgar with you. It would mean a lot to him, it really would. Today's not a good day. I'm sorry. Martha. Have a good day. Is dinner ready yet? Sweetheart, I'm gonna wait for your father to get home. He should be here any second. But I'm starving. Oh, okay. Well, if he's not back in five minutes, we'll start without him, okay? Oh, come on. Is that Dad? I don't know. Hello, Martha. Jack. Is Paul here? All right. Whoever you are, come on out of there. Oh, my God. Mr. Serrick? What happened? Is your friend here? My friend? Have you been in some kind of accident? Yes. I think maybe I have. What happened? I don't know. But there was a boy. A boy? A little boy. Oh, my God. Okay. You're gonna feel so much better when we get you all cleaned up. Oh! Sorry. Okay. And now the pants. Maybe you can help me. Very good. Excellent. And now, just get you in the water. Excellent. Try and clean this wound off. Hurts? I'm gonna take your stuff to the laundry, so everything will be nice and fresh and clean. No wallet? Were you robbed? Don't you remember anything? Do you know who you are? You're Mr. Serrick, you're Frank Serrick. Frank Serrick? Yes. Do I know you? Stay right here, okay? I'll be right back. Bless us, oh Lord, these thy gifts, which we're about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ our Lord, Amen. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Oh, that was very nice. Thank you. So now we need you to get stronger, so eat your pasta. You really don't remember me at all, do you, huh? I'm sorry. Well, it's okay, I mean we're only just really getting to know each other now. You've only been working here for a few days. I work here? Yes, Frank don't you remember you came by a few days ago looking for work? And we hit if off so wonderfully, and I offered you a few jobs to do. You said something about me having a friend. Yes. You said that you were traveling with another man, you'd been all over the state, remember? And he was looking for work, too. But I only had enough for you, and so he moved on. What about the boy? The boy? Shh. There's more than enough time for the boy later. It's really important that you get your strength back. Why don't we just have you... Eat your pasta, I made it specially for you. Yes, that's a good boy. Can I see the dressing? Oh, good. Oh, looks so much better, Mr. Serrick. Would you like some more wine? Mom? Do you think the police will ever find Dad? I don't know, honey. What if they don't? Well, whatever happens, we're gonna be okay. You know what? What? I'm the only kid in the whole school who's Dad maybe drownded in a lake. Oh, I love you, Frank. Oh, Frank. Take me. Take me now. Oh, Frank. I find you deeply attractive. Oh, Frank. You know, I haven't been with a man in a long time now, four years to be exact. Forgive the greeting card sentiment. But I've started to... Starting to think about you in that special way. You have beautiful eyes. And your hands. I don't know, there's this, ethereal quality about you. Oh. Oh, Frank. It's been a long time. I haven't been with a man in so long. Be gentle. What do we do now? Ah, Frank. Oh, Frank, oh. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, Frank. Touch me, touch me there. Frank, I love you. I love you so much. I love you. I love you. I've been waiting my whole life, and now you've come. Frank. Everyone the Father gives to me will come to me. I will never turn away anyone who believes in him. Sweetheart, please stop. He who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will also give you life through our mortal bodies through His enduring spirit. My heart therefor is glad and my spirit rejoices. My body also shall rest in hope. You will show me the path of light. In Your presence there is fullness of joy. And in Your right hand are pleasures forevermore. And sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to almighty God our brother, Paul. And we commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. I'm so sorry. I know you were a wonderful wife. And I'm sure he tried. Thanks, Trish. Mrs. Keller. My name is Tim Bishop. I'm the investigator for Luckland Insurance, your husband's company. Yes. Is there someplace that we can talk? Well, we're having people over to the house now, so... Maybe later? Actually next week would be better. I'm sorry, I can't. I just drove down from upstate. It's got to be today. All right... Would eight o'clock be all right? Yes, yes. Fine, after the reception. And I do express all my condolences. Thank you. Hi, honey. I'm home. I have such great food here. Miss me? Yeah, yeah, of course I missed you. But you were only gone 10 minutes, right? So? I missed you. Oh God, I missed you. You've been having those thoughts again, huh? Frank. Why don't you just try and put all of that stuff out of your mind. That boy does not, and never did, exist. I keep getting these mental images of two boys and water. So, there's two now? Lord, what imagination, Frank. Why don't you try and think of something nice for a change? Fresh air might help. No, no. We've gotta get you your strength back, we've gotta have you relax. I'm fine, it's just that I've been in this house for days. I just need to get out or sit in the sun or something. Sun? Oh, no. No. I know what the doctor ordered. How about a little afternoon delight? I'd rather not. You'd rather not? Hello? Hello? Hello. Do you remember me? Of course. The usual? Actually, I'm looking for my husband. I'm not sure I understand. We had a fight a few days ago and he walked out. I thought maybe he'd be staying here. Well, I can't say I've seen him, sorry. If it's okay, I'd like to leave my number. If you see him, would you call me? I'd be glad to. Thank you. I hope you and your husband patch things up. Bitch. I appreciate your making the time to see me, Mrs. Keller. Well, I'm very tired, so if we could just get to the point. All right. It's going to take more than erecting a plaque in a church yard for Luckland Insurance to pay off on a million dollar policy. I don't understand. Oh, come on Mrs. Keller, give me a break. There isn't even a body. Well, it's an enormous lake. I know that there have been drownings there before where the bodies were never found. As a matter of fact, I have a report. You might be interested in that. Well, does it mean anything to you? The name Frank Serrick? Yes. He was a childhood friend of Paul's. Your husband was a witness to that drowning. Look, I don't know where you're going with this, but I need a drink. Oh. Your hands are shaking, Mrs. Keller. Yeah, well, not for long. Excuse me. May I? Go ahead. I think your husband is still alive, Mrs. Keller. And I think you think so too. That's ridiculous. Is it? Can you think of any other explanation? Maybe he ran off with another woman? Think about it. After all, he is a man. I want you to go. I'd rather stay. And fuck you. I'm staying at the Economy Motel. If you change your mind. Thank you for choosing Luckland Life and Casualty. Thanks for taking the time to talk to me. Of course. Paul never encouraged my friendships with I'm glad you thought of me. I bet you're feeling pretty down. Yeah. Our insurance company sent out an investigator. I saw him at the funeral. I couldn't help but overhear. He says Paul's not dead. That's impossible. I mean, we all hope he's not, but... Well, he seems to feel that there's been some kind of fraud. The company won't pay on Paul's insurance. Can they do that? I don't know. I mean, it is an awful lot of money, and I guess if I was them, I'd wanna be sure too. How much is it? If you don't mind me asking. Well, it's a million dollars. That is a lot. So, oh, I... Edgar's been having such a hard time lately, I brought you his bear. I thought you could hold on to it, in case he needs it. Well, I'll do anything I can to help. Thanks. Here's my card. You let me know if you find anything else. We will. Hello? Veronica Dow, please. Who is this? Frank Serrick. Frank? - You know me then? - Where have you been, I was starting to think you really drowned. Drowned? Oh, no, no, not me, but what about the boy? Did you know the boy? What the hell are you talking about, Paul? Paul? Listen, buster. Just happened to have a very interesting conversation with your wife this morning. I mean, I knew you had an insurance policy, but Paul, a million dollars? Please, I don't know what you're talking about, - I really don't. - Oh, you don't, do you? I'm not even sure that I know you. I mean, you do sound familiar, but... Okay, I'm getting it now. It's you and Martha in this together, isn't it? Out to scam the insurance company and I'm just a patsy, right? Well, I'm not gonna be some Lee Henry Oswald. Perhaps I'd better call you at another time, okay? Perhaps you should. You talking to her? Huh? Answer me, Frank. Frank. Oh, Frank, please. I'll do anything, please just don't leave me. Please. I love you. I love you. You know I love so much. Oh, Frank, I need you. I need you to marry me, please. Well, aren't you gonna say anything. You're just gonna let me humiliate myself? Doesn't love mean anything to you? Well, fuck you! Bartender. Do any broads come in here? Not really, no. Well. Fuck that. Economy Motel. Hello, yes. I'd like Mr. Bishop's room, please. I'll connect you. Hello. Hi. It's Martha. What? Mrs. Keller. Mrs. Keller. What do I owe the pleasure? I just wanted you to know that I thought things over, and I'd like to discuss the situation. Pleased to hear that. So, do you wanna come over here? Well. Well, why don't you come over here? Well, I can't because my son is asleep. Sound asleep in the other room, and... What do you say, Mr. Bishop? Come in. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, honey. Mr. Bishop. Oh yeah. Mr. Bishop, please slow down, Mr. Bishop. - Oh yeah. - Mr. Bishop, don't you remember, I'm in mourning, Mr. Bishop Oh, honey. Oh Baby. - Slow down, slow down. - Oh Baby. - Just a bit, Mister... - Oh. Oh, Baby. Oh. Oh. Oh, Baby. Oh, boy. Oh. - Oh, Baby. - Mr. Bishop. - Oh, Babe. - Mr. Bishop. Oh. That was nice. What did you do? Oh, Lord. Hello? Oh hello, Martha. No, I was just grading some work. What's up? Where was Edgar through all this? He was asleep in his room. He didn't hear you? You didn't scream? Was I supposed to? Martha, this man raped you. Not exactly. Martha. Honey, this man, he raped you. You can't just let him get away with it. - I can't? - No, make him pay. How? I don't know, for starters you could threaten to go to the police if he doesn't pay on that policy. Oh. Oh, no, I can't. No, I couldn't face him again. Couldn't. Then I'll do it. Oh, I can't ask you to do that. You're not, I'm volunteering. Where's he staying? The Economy Motel? Yeah. Listen, I bet the last place you wanna be is back at that house, so why don't you stay here and I'll call you the minute I know something. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Veronica? Yeah? Thanks. How's your head, darling? Not so good. I feel terrible about what happened. I guess my temper just got the best of me. That's all right. Things happen. I feel pretty uncomfortable here. How about untying my hands? No. I just can't take that chance right now. What chance, Sweetheart? I'm not going anywhere. I'm yours. I promise. You just don't realize how much you mean to me, Frank. I've been waiting my entire life for Mr. Right. You're him. You're my better half. You're my significant other. You're my Anthony to my Cleopatra. You're my Romeo to my Juliet. My Dauphane to my Saint Joan. Frank. You're my soulmate. We were born to be together. You're my bridges of Ventura County guy. I can't risk losing you. I would be nothing without you. Do you love me, Frank? Tell me you love me, Frank. I love you, Charlene. I know you do. What's wrong with you people? Mr. Bishop? Who's asking? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about what you did to Martha Keller. Oh, is that who that was? You know, this isn't a joke. You raped that woman. What? All right, so I raped her. Now you've gotta prove it. Oh, that shouldn't be so hard. After all, you are a man and you did leave evidence. What do you want out of this? We don't want anything. Just the money from the insurance policy. What's in it for you? Well, Martha and I'll work something out. Everybody has an angle. So, what do you say? I've got Martha Keller waiting by that phone. One word from me and she's off to see the doctor and the sheriff. Looks like you're caught between a rock and a hard place. No. You don't give me enough credit, Miss Dow. What are you talking about? I just happen to know that you were fucking Reverend Keller. What? Come on, the whole town knows about it. That's outrageous. Is it? And I can prove it. I trust you're not planning to transport me across the state line. I don't get it. Oh? I can tell by your face that you do. Isn't this where you came to fuck him? That's ridiculous. It's quite logical, really. It's far enough from town to be discreet, but close enough to come here a couple times a week, or maybe more. Shut up. What's it like doing a man of the cloth? What's the matter? Your girlfriend is here. You make me nuts. Well, you've had enough time. I'm calling Mrs. Keller. Martha? It's Veronica. Did you talk to him yet? Yeah, I'm with him right now. He wants to talk to you. Hello, darling. This is lover boy. Miss Dow and I have something that might interest you here. Can you come up right now? A little motel. On highway 86 about a half hour south of the city. Good. I'll see you shortly. You're a beautiful woman, Miss Dow. I can't say that I blame the good reverend for his lack of restraint. Which room is he in? What? You can stop the charade, or I can just go ask the desk clerk. Hello. Can I help you? I believe you have a guest staying here named Keller. Although he's probably changed his name. There's nobody here. Oh. Can I speak with the manager or the owner, please? I'm the manager. And the owner. Help! Somebody help me! Help! God, help me! So, there's nobody staying here. Help! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! I'm an investigator. Ah! Why? It's your karma. You fucking bitch! Shit. Usual room, huh, bitch? Cunt, douche bag. You'll wish you never met him! Okay. I gotta go and take care of something in there. And I want you to stay in the truck. - Do I have to? - Yes, you have to. Hello? Hello? Mr. Bishop? Edgar. Edgar! Edgar! Edgar! Mom? Come here, Sweetie. Come here. Edgar, get down! Sweetie, Run, hide! Oh, you little cunt, douche bag, bitch. He's mine! Come out, you bitch. Got something for you. Where is he, is he alive? I never wanted any of this to happen. I just wanted Paul. Well, you can have him. What? I said you can have him! He's yours. That whole time they spent dredging the lake I was watching and I was praying. You know what I was praying? God, please don't let them find him. Because I hate him. I could not admit that when he was alive, I mean when he's dead. I mean, when he's, I thought he was alive when I thought he was dead. You know what I mean. Anyway. If he's alive like you say, honey, you can have him. I don't know. So much has happened. All I want is my freedom. That and the insurance. I don't think it could be like we planned. Too much has happened. Too much of everything. Look. I'm not greedy, what do you want? You want to split the money? I don't care. I just don't want him back. Mom! Mom! Honey, are you all right? Come here and look. Come quick. Look! Frank. Hi. Hi. I didn't mean to push you under. Look. Oh my God, Paul? Paul, it's me. You don't know who I am, do you? Do you know who I am, Paul? What's wrong with Dad, Mom? He's just very sick. Martha, what are we gonna do? Edgar, go wait in the truck. - But... - Go! Frank. Frank. Frank. Go, get the gun. Get the iron. Get anything you could've possibly touched. Then what? We're gonna have to kill him. We can't do that. Look. You either take him, or you take half a million dollars. Decide. I can't watch. You won't have to. After you get the stuff, you go back to the truck, take Edgar to your place. You wait for me to call you. The keys are in the truck. You understand? Okay go. Go on. Miss Dow. Do you think my dad will ever get better and come home? I don't know. I hope not. Martha? Rest in peace, Paul. Okay, okay. Get that. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Stop it. Here. Toss it.
