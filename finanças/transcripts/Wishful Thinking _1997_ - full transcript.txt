[ Rain Falling ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Man Narrating ] I was once hypnotized by a spoon. I was alone in the kitchen, and I pulled one out of the drawer and started staring at it. It was like it was speaking to me. I forgot who I was, what I was doing-- everything. The damn thing had me in a trance. After a few minutes, when the spoon really had me where it wanted, it told me to walk over to the trash can and pee in it. You could say I was a little confused at that moment. I saw a doctor and he said, "People lose their senses like that all the time." You know what ? It isn't just caused by spoons. [ Panting ] Sorry ! Sorry ![ Shouting ] Excuse me ! [ Woman ] Now, I have some very, very good news. The test came back-- the second test-- and it came in "negative." Mm-hmm. [ Door Closes ]Oh, that-- Um-- Excuse me. If I could have your attention for a second, please. Could you hold on one second ?Thank you. I need somebody to-- Thank you, Miss.Hold on. Um, I think this dog is kind of hurt. He's got a little cut on his head here.[ Whimpering ] [ Scoffs ] God. It looks like he's been beaten. Yeah. Did you do this ?No. Of course not. No, I-- I just-- I really need a doctor to take a look at him. You know, get some stitches, a shampoo or something. Oh, God ! Uh, he's coming. Um-- Who's he ?Uh-- Um, you take him ! Yeah, that's it. Good. Bye, dog. [ Dogs Barking ]Give it up, asshole ! I warned you !Dog beater ! [ Barking Continues ] Well, well, well. If it ain't the hero. Take it easy, mister. I just thought the dog looked pretty bad. I thought maybe he might need some attention, you know ? [ Stammering ] Medical attention. [ Grunting ] [ Body Falls To Ground ] [ Woman ] Oh, my God. Are you okay ? Are you okay ? Did I kill him ?No, he left. Did he get the dog ?No, I wouldn't give it to him. I told him I was gonna call the police. It was so great what you did. No, that's okay. I'm--Oh, my God ! You've got a big cut up there. Come on. Yeah.Actually, I could use a little comfort right here. Am I delirious, or are you kind of pretty ? [ Chuckles ] You're very delirious. What's your name ?Elizabeth. I'm Max. You like movies ? [ Man Announcing ] On the weather front, it looks like summer is gasping its last breath. It may be warm today, but the forecast calling for cold and rain. [ Knocking ] Autumn's on its way, folks, whether you like it or not. [ Door Opens ] [ Woman ] Max is here ! He says he has a date with you. I'll be right out. [ Door Closes ] [ Gasps ] Is that-- Oh, my God ! That's where that guy hit you. Yeah.[ Gasps ] Wow ! That was so good of you-- I'll be right out !

Come here, you.[ Moans ] [ Both Laughing ] [ Man Announcing ] Tristate area expecting to reach the high 90s. That's hot. You could just call your mother. Is that the way you do it in Iowa ? You remember the rule: no knocking Iowa. Look, if I just call my mother on Mother's Day, she would kill me. We have to at least to take her out to brunch. She only lives an hour away. I always just call my mother.Well, that's 'cause she lives 2,000 miles away. Yes, but she's very close to my heart. Listen, normally I would, but this time I won't. My mother called me and told me that since you've moved in, I've only gone to see her once. I haven't seen my mother at all. Can I help it if you're evil ? No, I don't suppose you could, but would you really want to ? Evil is so much more interesting than good, don't you think ? Well, it depends on whether or not we're going to see my mother. Well, as long as I can get some evil in sometime, I suppose I can swing it. In that case, I'm ready to be possessed. [ Max Narrating ] I used to be... an idiot. Ta-da. Oh, Max ! Ohhh. Open it ! [ Rubs Hands Together ] I can't believe it. Go on. Open it. Oh. Your toothpick. Yeah, it came this morning. Isn't it great ? [ Chuckles ] Yeah, it's nice. It's just... a little small. Oh, God ! I'm an idiot. I just realized how this looked. No. Just--I-I'm sorry. [ Stammering ] I just wanted to surprise you. No, no, no. It's just-- I saw the box, and I thought--Of course. I'm a colossally stupid human being. - I'm so sorry. - I shouldn't even bring it up. It's just since my little sister got married, I've been thinking. I've been thinking that I'm the last one, you know ? I mean, I'm the last one in my family to-- Yeah, me too. The same is true for me. Well, h-have you thought about it ? Actually, I have, a lot. And I just need to feel in my chest that it's the right time for that. You don't-- You don't feel it in your chest ? No, no. I-I feel it in my chest that I love you. I love you. I just need to feel in my chest that it's the right time for that. Okay ? Yeah. You wanna try again ? Yeah. Yeah. [ Clears Throat ] All right. Ta-da. Oh, a surprise ! Wow ! What is it ? Why-- It's-- It's a toothpick with a floss attachment ! My God. Somebody ought to market these to restaurants. It'd make a lot of money.That's an excellent idea. Oh, my God. What's that taste ? What taste ? [ Unwrapping Toothpick ] They taste like ginger. It's kind of strange.Uh-oh. Ah-ha. It says right here: "Ginger Flav." Houston, we got a problem. [ Closes Box ]Serves you right. [ Sighs ] [ Max Narrating ] The problem with being an idiot is you can't stop doing it. You can't just decide one day that you're no longer gonna do idiotic things. It doesn't work that way.[ Sniffs ] In order to quit doing idiotic things, you first have to be able to recognize what they are. [ Voice ] Tastes like ginger. Tastes like ginger.

[ Speaks Japanese ] [ Lena Narrating ] Truth was I was looking for a new beginning, but only as a test. Before I put my plan into effect, I had to see if I could ever find someone else... who made me feel the way Max did. Arigato. Gracias. So, do you come here a lot ? Actually, I do. It's really healthy here, and, um, Max turned me onto it, so-- I really trust him, as far as recommendations go. I think a lot of people say, "You should try this," or "Do that," and they think that they know best. They don't. Are you okay ? No-- Yeah-- It's just-- - I swear this just blinked at me. - You mean the sea urchin ? You should try it. It's delicious. - What's the yellow thing ? - That's a quail egg. It's good for your hair. See, who comes up with these combinations ? It's like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup situation. Two guys walk together-- bang.

We like to add a phrase to the end of the fortune to make it funnier. Yeah ! Yeah ! Actually, Max likes to do that. He adds, "in bed." So it would be like, "You will have great fortune and wealth in bed." "In bed" is a great one. That's a great one to add. I like it. What do you add ?Uh, "and then you die." That's kind of spooky.

I meant just more like-- 'Cause it's a twist on-- I hadn't heard the "in bed" one, which I'll use-- [ Lena Narrating ] The jury was still out, but I felt like I already knew the verdict. The thing about destiny is it doesn't always come true. I know its definition says it should. But I think there's destiny, and then there's potential destiny. Everyone's got about two or three potential destinies. Destiny usually decides which destiny comes true. But if you're clever, you know you have to give the destiny you want a little push. [ Jack ] So what made you decide to stop by ? I bought you a present.[ Scoffs ] Thanks, but what for ? Well, two reasons. First: I wanted to thank you for the party the other night. And two: I thought I could help you improve on your manners. You really think I'm rude ? Here. What are they ?They're cards, silly. So you can write people notes like "thank you's", "get wells," "I miss you's." You're supposed to mail 'em ? Well, that's one way, but it's also nice to give it in person. Is this why you're here ? Yes. That, and I wanna rent a video. All right. I'll fix you up. You got anything you want at your disposal. What's Lena's first "fame and fortune" video gonna be ? Waited on by the president. Wow !

Well, maybe he was just consoling her. They've known each other a long time. There's always been sexual tension between those two. You saw 'em !Yeah, but-- Maybe it was just innocent. Then why would she deny it ? I don't think I can handle this. I've never felt like this before. It's like someone else is in charge of my mind. I'm helpless. I'll help you. You are helping me. [ Max ] Lena ! - Hey ! - Hey ! - Can I come up ? - Yeah. I'm sorry !It's all right. [ Max ] Maybe I should go over to Jack's right now. What do you think ? [ Lena ] No. Remember what I said ? It's all up to fate now. So, you might as well just sit back and let it happen. That sounds great. Like watching football on TV. Well, the more relaxed you are, the more relaxed she is, and the more relaxed she is, the better your chances with her are. - What are you doing ? - Hmm ? Oh, nothin'. Max ? Whatever happens between you and Elizabeth, I don't want it to hurt you. Too late. It has ? Well, let's make you feel better. Put your head in my lap. What are you gonna do ?Nothing weird. Come here. Okay. Now I'm gonna start an expression and I want you to finish it. Okay. I finish expressions. Exactly. Good. Curiosity-- Killed the cat. Look--But don't touch. Before you leap. Oh, yeah. I see. It takes-- One to know one. You can't-- Always get what you want. Now, what is it that you wish, Lena ? Tarot ? Maybe palm ? I just want some advice. Advice ? Come. Come and sit in my chair. If you did some-- something wrong... to someone that you loved, but there was no way they'd ever find out, would you tell them ? This person, you love him with your true heart ? Yes. And if you don't tell him he will never know ? Is this true ?Yes. Will you ?What ? You will know, yes ? Of course. Then I have a question for you. How will your true heart... ever love... if it knows its love holds knives... and not kisses ? [ Sighs ] [ Line Ringing ] [ Phone Ringing ][ Elizabeth ] I'm sorry. [ Ringing Continues ] Hello ? It's true, isn't it ? Who is this ?You can tell me. You're cheating on him, aren't you ? What ? How could you do it to him ?You don't know what you're talking about. Then what was going on at the movie theater ? Oh, so you're the little bird. I knew it. Somehow, I just knew it. Well, you want to know what was going on at the theater ? I was waiting for Jack so I could take him to the nearest hotel and fuck him. How's that ? He betrayed me, I betrayed him. So now you'll probably go out with him and he'll betray you. [ Henry ] Who is it ? You're making this all up, aren't you ? Oh, my God. I think you might have just had a thought. You're a fucking genius, Lena ! [ Dial Tone Humming ] [ Ringing ] [ Max ] Hello ? Max, it's Lena. Do you know something ? They're there at your place. You gotta go.Who ? Elizabeth. She's with him. I heard them. You gotta go fix it. Are you sure ?I heard him. Damn it ! They're both there ? Yes. Max, there's something I need to tell you-- something about me. What ? [ Shouting ] Lena, what ? I don't have time for this ! I-- I lied about seeing Elizabeth with Jack. I pushed them together. I wanted you and Elizabeth to break up so that I could be with you. Max ? Max ? [ Lena Narrating ] Right then, I learned the only thing I've ever really learned: I didn't know anything. [ Elizabeth ] What difference does it make what I say ? You're not gonna believe me. [ Max ] 'Cause you can't say it ! I'm saying this. I am going out tonight and I might not come home. How's that ? If you explain it, I will believe you. I'll see you.If you'd just explain it, I'd believe you. [ Grunts ] That hurt ! [ Elizabeth Narrating ] I was having problems with my boyfriend. I knew he could be jealous, but somehow this went deeper. I've always believed there was goodness at the bottom of people. But now I was beginning to think that if you could strip away... all the weakness and insecurity, underneath you'd only findmore weakness and insecurity. Hey. Oh, hi. What are you doing ? Just more problems with you-know-who. Oh. That's too bad. Well, you were so nice to me about it, at your party, I thought maybe-- I don't know-- maybe we could go out for a cup of coffee or somethin'. Uh, yeah, uh, definitely. Um-- Listen, uh, Why don't you come along ? Well, I don't want to intrude or anything. She won't mind if I bring along an old friend. Yeah, and interfere with your getting some ? I don't think so. Come on. I just met her. Why don't you join us ? Mmm, I think I'll survive on my own. It's okay. Are you sure ?Yeah. Yeah. I'm really sorry. I-- It's okay. Have fun. [ Henry ] Split pea ? I'd have taken you for chicken noodle there. Navy bean or-- Henry. Jack's party. Mm-hmm.Floss guy. Elizabeth. Hi. Hey. So, um, what are you doing up this late ? I'm always up this late. I'm always, uh-- My time clock works a little differently... than, uh, normal people, so-- What do you mean ? Well, I sleep in shifts-- from 4:00 until 8:00, four hours each, twice a day. [ Chuckles ] Why ? Well, I get twice as many days as most people. See, I have my day-day, and then I get a nap, and then I have my night-day. I'm 64 and yet remarkably supple.[ Laughs ] Do you mind if I sit down ?No, go ahead. Thanks. [ Groans ] The real question is, uh, what are you doing up here at 1:00 in the morning ? Mm, I didn't want to go home. Mm-hmm ? Well, actually, there was someone that I didn't want to go home to, so-- Yeah. You didn't have to tell me. I saw the rest of it on Melrose Place. [ Laughs ] What happens ? It's very moving, until that bitch steals your baby. Stop it.How could she ? [ Laughing ] Was it bad ? Bad enough. [ Laughing ] That was a good one.That was a good one. Okay, now the next one is, um, you have to do utter disdain, all right ? Yeah. All right.Utter disdain for a person... who cuts in front of you in line. All right ? And he's bigger. Person cuts in front of me in line and utter disdain and he's bigger than I am. [ Laughs ] That was good. Yeah ? Yeah. You're really good at this. I spent years with Mummenschanz. So I can learn my lessons well. All right. Here's one for you.Okay, I'm ready. You're on the phone. You're baby-sitting. You get a prank phone call. When suddenly someone breaks in. It's coming from the basement. [ Gasps ]That was very good. That was really good.Did you like the high-pitched scream ? Yeah. I didn't know your mouth opened that wide.Wow. What about the scariest thing ? I ever did ? Um-- Riding the Cyclone. What's that ? The Cyclone ? Mm-hmm. Oh, man. It's this really old wooden roller coaster out at Coney Island. Tremendous.I've never even been there. We should go. Now ? - Yeah, absolutely. It's the best time - Isn't it closed now ? No, it's open late, and I don't have to be in bed for another two hours. Okay. Yeah ? Yeah, let's go. [ Horn Sounding ] ♪♪ [ Woman Scatting ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ People Screaming ] He used to be so... much different. I don't know. Like those toothpicks, with the floss on the end ?Yeah. Man, I know it was a crazy idea, but I liked it. I liked that he was always coming up with wild ideas. And what happened ? Well, ever since I brought up the idea of marriage, he kind of lost his sense of humor. And now the only wild idea that he has is that "I'm not to be trusted." [ Chuckles ] Wasn't he writing a book or something ? Yeah, but that hasn't happened yet, so-- And what about you ? What do you want to do ? You say you like wild ideas ? Yeah. I wasn't gonna tell you what I did, but-- Elizabeth, I'm a hired assassin. [ Laughs ] I kill for money and sheer enjoyment. And I was hired by a foreign government to kill you. I don't know what you did in Canada, but they're very angry. Come on. I make prints for other photographers. Really ? Yeah. Do you like it ? It's all right. It's not the kind of travel opportunities as killing for money. When are you ever serious ? Just say the word. [ Touch Tone Dialing ] [ Line Ringing ] [ Woman ] Hello. You've reached the Black residence. We're not home right now, so leave your name and number and we'll get back to you. [ Machine Beeps ]Hi, Mom. It's me. I was just calling to chat. You home ? I guess you already went to work. [ Door Opens ] Anyway, I should go. I just wish you were home. Love to Dad. Bye. What ? [ Phone Ringing ]Otherwise, maybe you should just wait. And if you want to talk to the doctor, that would be-- [ Ringing Continues ] Excuse me. Uh, West Village Veterinary Hospital. [ Whining ]Hi. No, I was hoping you would call. [ Laughs ] Now ? [ Horn Blaring ] Thanks a lot. Thank you so much. You're so very kind. Oh, Lena.Hey. You scared the shit out of me. [ Elizabeth Narrating ] It's odd how you need someone else to make you feel guilty. If you were alone on an island, you'd never feel guilty... because there'd be no else there to judge you. But the other requirement for guilt... is that you have to think it's wrong as well. It's a two-party contract, which is helpful... because if you don't think you're guilty, then you don't have to waste your time feeling that way.Bye. Hey. Hi.Oh, my God. We've almost been found out, I swear.What ? Elizabeth, where are we going ? What ? What ? What, are you gonna mug me ?No, no ! [ Panting ] What's going on ? She saw me waiting for you. She saw me waiting for you. And I was just sitting there lying. I stammered so much I'm sure I gave everything away. What do you think she thought ? That I was crazy-- that's what she probably thought. Maybe you are a little bit. [ Laughs ] I know, it's great. It's good. Yeah, I am. I think I am, you know.It's okay. Yeah, well-- What it is is I have never been in this kind of situation before. I feel like I'm in some kind of weird-- I don't know. I-I-- I keep thinking that a murderer always leaves a clue.A murderer ? Yeah. A murderer always leaves a clue at the scene of the crime. What did you leave behind ?Well, yeah, I haven't left anything yet. But I was thinking that... if I were really bad, [ Chuckles ] that I probably would have left it at Coney Island. Did you want to leave it ?Sure. Your heart's beating so fast.[ Laughs ] Well-- [ Sighs ] What about Max ? Or--Um-- I don't know about Max. Can we just go to a different movie ?Sure. Let's just go to a different movie, okay ?Yeah. But no foreign films, all right ? It'll just be too depressing. That's okay with me. I'm allergic to culture.Oh, really ? How convenient. Subtitles give me a rash. Max ? Can you-- What ? I got my recommendation from Dr. Hillard. It was great. Yeah ? Great. That's good.Yeah. Congratulations, really. Thanks. See you. [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Phone Ringing ] - Hello ? - I couldn't tell him. How come ? Well, I couldn't separate with him... without telling him about you and I couldn't... tell him about you without... crushing him, you know ? And without me becoming a cheating slut, so-- He's at work, right ?Yeah. I'm comin' over. [ Dial Tone Humming ]What ? No, wait ! [ Stammers ] [ Knocking ] Hi.Hi. Can I come in ? You're not supposed to be here. No ? [ Latches Door ] [ Muttering ] You can sit right here.Thanks. I should-- What ? Tell him. I should go.What ? Should I go ? I don't know. What do you want ? I just-- [ Laughs ] I just want it to be over. You know ? But I know that once... he knows, [ Sighs ] that it would be awful and... that it will probably... go on forever. And I just don't want to... start so much... ugliness. I'm glad you're here though. Yeah. [ Phone Ringing ] I'm sorry. Hello ?[ Lena ] It's true, isn't it ? Who is this ?You can tell me. You're cheating on him, aren't you ? You're a fucking genius, Lena. Fuck ! Fuck ! [ Woman Giggles ] Elizabeth, it's me ! I know you two are in here ! - Open the door ! - [ Elizabeth ] Hold on just a second ! No, I'm not gonna hold on ! I know what you two are doing ! There's no sense in hiding ! Hold on just a second ! This isn't your fault. Yes, it is. Here. - Open the fucking door !- This isn't what I meant to do. - Where is he ? - What are you doing ? It's a simple question. I'd like a direct answer. Now where is he ?Don't yell at me ! It just upsets me ! Elizabeth, I want you to explain to me what's going on. I don't care if it's a fucking lie ! Now tell me what's going on here, and look me in the eye ! I said, look me in the eye. I-- I was in the bathroom, and I was going to take a shower. What's that on your neck ?What ? The mark, what is it ?There's no mark. What are you talking about ?He is a big boy. All that weight pushin' down on you. You don't know.Or was it a hug good-bye, something sweet and precious ? Which word don't you understand ? - At least I know I'm not crazy. - You are fuckin' crazy ! [ Speaking Foreign Language ] What the fuck are you doing up here ? Will I see you ?Some time. I'm sorry. [ Max Narrating ] At that moment, I became two Max's: One was lying on the roof, while the other one-- me-- floated up into the sky. As I rose, I began to see what had happened-- to see what I had done. [ No Audible Dialogue ] And with that knowledge, I flew into the clouds. It was a mistake. I got a bad idea in my head. It wasn't a mistake, Max. I need to be away from you for a while so I can figure out what's going on with me. So you can be with him ? I don't know what will happen with Henry. I just-- I just want to be on my own for a while. How long ?I don't know. And then we get back together ? I don't know, Max. I mean, I don't know if things could be the same between us. I-- I mean, I wouldn't say never, but I wouldn't say maybe either. But you--I wish it weren't true. I wish everything in the world weren't true. Me too, but it is. [ Sighs ] I sold the toothpicks. Where ? Chinatown. Apparently, they love the flavor. I sold them to a chain. They ordered 100,000. That's great, Max. Congratulations. Thanks. You leaving ? Yeah. I guess I should leave you alone, huh ? Bye, Elizabeth. Bye, Max. [ Lena Narrating ] That day I started to hear a new voice-- one that didn't come from above. [ Elizabeth Narrating ] You know, if you could strip away... everything superficial from people, really get to the bottom of them, you wouldn't necessarily find weakness and insecurity. You'd just find something else to strip away. And behind that would be something else. What's at the bottom of people ? There is no bottom. [ Max Narrating ] Then I returned from the sky, and the two Max's were joined together. I began to think of something that happened when I was floating in the sky. I flew into a cloud, and I heard a voice-- quiet and clear. It said, "Be careful where you tread, for the world is full of angels." [ Max ] Lena ! "You'll be very successful in business, and then you'll die." "You are surrounded by true friends who are all going to die." [ Opening Fortune Cookie ] Oh. "One of your best friends will try to destroy your life... by telling you that your girlfriend is cheating on you, and then you'll die." - Max, I said I was sorry for that. - I'm just joking. [ Sighs ] Okay. "You will find the one you truly want, and they'll forgive you... in bed."And then you'll both die. So what do we do ?Get out of here because this is a dangerous area. I was mugged here.Really ? Yes, by the freak show-- the bearded lady. Oh, right.Never call her "Scruffy." Uh-huh.[ Laughs ] I'm sorry. What happened ? Okay, what happened ? She-- I-- She called me "Scruffy." We became friends. You know what they love, the bearded ladies ?What ? Uh, flowers and hair conditioner. ♪♪ [ Woman Scatting ] ♪♪ [ Scatting Continues ] ♪♪ [ Scatting Continues ]
