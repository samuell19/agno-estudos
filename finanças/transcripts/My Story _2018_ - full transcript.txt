'Stories. 'Stories that blossomed in the pages of my life' 'I'm whispering them in your ears' 'With a black and white font' 'Time is writing it down' 'My tears and my dreams' 'My inner smiles, my truths and lies' 'For you to know the story in which all of them come together' 'I'm pouring down as a cloud of silence' (A vintage Malayalam melody plays on the radio) Don't you have some dreams about yourselves? Some beautiful hopes that you keep within yourselves, without telling anyone? Each person becomes distinct from the other... ...through those secrets that we never confess to anyone, for an entire lifetime! In the heart of an ordinary village boy, ...this is how the screenplay of a dream commenced, ...without his own knowledge. You're really lucky, my son! God is with you, my lad! Look! Did you see the twin circles? In the past 19 years, I've never seen such a flawless sign. - True. Son... Do you know who that is? Nages hwar Rao. I have touched that head. Saw this? Let this good luck charm remain within your palm. Just remember what this grandpa told you. Your future is in cinema. You will rule as a king there! I swear on this mirror, and myself, Keshavan! It was Keshava Perumal who shined a silver light called cinema into his dreams. He kept that good luck charm close to his heart, never losing it from his palm. Offering prayers to Kaitheri Mangulam Goddess, ...here comes the angry young superhero of Indian Cinema, ...our very own Jayakrishnan. (Soundtrack of the Amitabh Bachchan movie, 'Shahenshah') By relation, I'm your big daddy! The name is Shahenshah (Emperor)! A dream that I saw during sleepless nights at the festival grounds in the village, Madras. God gave me a right hand to knock on the huge doors there. Siddique Mohammed alias Siddhu. - Good morning sir - Good morning. Where is Siddhu? Sir, shall we confirm the title 'Spadikam'? - Siddhu! - Sir! Siddhu, has Mohanlal reached? - Lalettan... Sorry, Lal sir has left from his house, sir. Okay. Chackocha, confirm once more before giving it. -Okay. I'll call you. Okay. bye- Sir... Sir... A friend of mine has come from Kerala. Just to get introduced to you. Shall I call him? Over there. Okay? Com e! Com e! (Song from the movie 'Spadikam') Good. There is confidence in his eyes. He hasn't ruined it by acting yet. - Yes. What's your name? - Jayakris... Jai. I've been working on this film for one and a half years now. I'll think about the next film only after this is over. Well, Siddique... Aren't you the production controller of Williams' next movie? Introduce him to Williams, man. Sir, you know how Williams sir is, right? I'm saying this becausel know your equation with Williams sir. If you could recommend him.. I Will tell him. Just like you met me, meet him as well. So Jai... All the best! - Thank you, sir. - Thanks a lot, sir. Sir... My name is Jai. I need this chair for just one minute. Sir... I mean, Williettan... Siddhu told me that you're a really short-tempered... ...and that you're a unique character. Then I told him that he needn't come; and I'll meet you directly. In the next movie that you're making, you should give me a role, Williettan. That too... not just a character role. Hero! My hard work for four years... My dream of 14 years... A lifetime of gratitude... These are my qualifications. I'll give you one guarantee. Because of such a decision, you'll never gain a bad name anywhere. Rather than giving it to someone else and letting it flop, ...isn't it better that I do it well, sir? Do you drink? I don't have that habit. Well, I just asked for a formality. Do you have a passport? Even though my whole body was shivering from head to toe, I acted courageous while I was not. Was it because of that? Or was it the blessing of Bhadran sir's word? What my heart desired... ...Williettan gave it to me. Hey! Have you promised someone that you'll come & stand here in the midnight? I've stood here like this on so many nights. But an address I didn't have on any of those days... I have it today, dude. The address of a hero. Didn't this Madras gift it to me? So... ...shouldn't I thank her? There's only one name you have to remember hereafter. That belongs to the heroine of this movie. Tara. The only lucky star in all four languages in South India, after Sridevi. She is the only one. What a huge market she has! If she likes you... ...she might even recommend you. Then you would never have to look back. She committed this movie because her dad Vishwan sir forced her to. That's the equation between Vishwan sir, and our movie's producer, David Eapen sir. But don't expect just one thing from this movie. - Money. - Correct. How did you understand that? Dude, we tried so much for a beginning that we won't get, however much we pay, rig ht? So if I have to leave Madras again... we'll go only as winners. Good evening Ladies & Gentlemen, and welcome to Vivo SIIMA. The night when your most favourite stars and films are celebrated... ...in the best, biggest possible manner. 20 years, 200 films, one man! Jai. 20 years. 200 films. After all those achievements, I realized that I was completely alone, ...when Siddhu left me, handing over his son who was his carbon copy, to me. Before he died, he reminded me of that name again. Tara. With my own blood... growing in your sister's womb... - Sir... - Okay. Tara Madam is ready. Wait. I'm not afraid of you, Captain Vincent Godfrey. ...or those boot-licking dogs of yours, that you have let loose. Jai, as you finish half of this dialogue, ...you should pull the heroine towards your side. Then, you should look into her eyes... - Okay. - Okay, sir. All the best. Shall we go for a take? Jai, are you ready? Yes. Roll sound. Camera... - 4214. Take 1, Clap! Action! I'm not afraid of you, Captain Vincent Godfrey! ...or those boot-licking dogs of yours, that you have let loose. The grave sin that you committed to me and my family, I won't be avenging it with your blood! Instead, it will be with my own blood. With my own blood, growing in your sister's womb. From today... she is my woman. Hey! I am your biggest fan in the world. Tara? From today... she is my woman. Sir... Shall we move? 'Who are you?' 'The star etched by the night?' 'Who are you?' Could I please request the prominent director Girish Kasaravalli, to kindly come up on stage to hand over the next award for Best Actor. SIIMA Best Actor award goes to... Jai. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Jai, congratulations on the award. Can we please know what you're feeling right now? 'My heart is melting' 'It's a cloud of moonlit love' 'I'll pour down as a rain, within you' That day you get the most precious gift of your life... ...what will you tell the world? I was an ordinary young man for whom acting was a desire, and cinema was a dream. There wasn't any guarantee that I would be able to achieve it, ...at any point during my struggle for it. When I stood in front of the camera for the first time, ...eliminating all the darkness within me, ...two eyes opened before me. The actor in me was born, in those eyes. I saw my first viewer in those eyes. That hand which held my stretched out hand, ...was the first award I ever received. Today... Like this gift in my hand... Those eyes, and that hand... I'll remember them until I die. Boney, I need a ticket to Frankfurt immediately. I'll tell you where I'm going from there, once I reach there. Sir, Rafi & Dimple left to Hyderabad with the costumes, Okay sir. I'm starting right now. Dude, Jayan... Shahenshah Jayan? Where are you off to? When I'm stepping fon/vard to do a good thing, don't irritate me. To cross the sea from here, you need something like this. Visa. It's a blessing from Lord Ganapathy. Fall at my feet. I'm wearing a coat. I had already imagined this frame, when the costumer said that the coat for the song shoot is missing. Your entry wearing a coat. Well, where did you get these goggles from? When I went to make an offering at Beemappalli Mosque, I got it from there. Stylish, right? Ya right! Shall I tell you the truth? This coat & those goggles don't deserve that. Anyway, hold this. Cross all the seven seas and come. Come on, dude. Friends, welcome to Lisbon. Myself, Mr. Joseph Silva. You can call me Uncle Joseph. The most beautiful place on earth... No doubt. It's Kerala, where you came from. If the places you're going to see are beautiful, the reason for that are the rules and regulations, ...followed by people who come here. Whatever you want to do, you can do it staying within the confines of the freedom permitted to you. (Speaks in Portuguese) What does that mean? Oh sorry. Get into the bus. It's too cold here. The rest of the game is here. Com e. You'll be staying here. David sir will come only in the evening, ...after picking Tara Madam. You should do me a favour. Those who are getting down, ...should take one packet each from that. It's Indian food prepared by the people here. And to carry the luggage? Son, this is Europe. You should take care of yourself. The stay and food look quite cheap, Joseph. Vishwan Sir and you will be staying in the new block there. Tara Madam too. Your luggage will reach there. So what are these people who trusted me & came with me? Cattle or deer? To be sent to this cattle-shed? It just looks old. This is heritage, sir. The price increases along with the age. Wherever they are, I will stay only there. Tell the producer, ...to take care of the heroine's father really well. Sheesh! What company will I have without you guys? You go there now, Vishwettan. We'll meet in the evening. I don't care if it's morning or evening. But we do! Siddhu, get Vishwettan settled down there. - Where's my suitcase? - Vishwetta, com e. Excuse me sir. Sir, your ID. Thank you. Your... ...Hindi is pretty good. Punjabi dad and Portuguese mom. Grew up on Bollywood and Pessoa. Dad has shown me all 14 of your Hindi films. Is this your first time in Lisbon? No, I've been here before. Once. If you don't mind me asking... Why are you here... ...in this hotel? The Four Seasons, is just half an hour away. Have you heard of one Mr. David Eapen? An Indian businessman. He used to own this property. I'll find out, sir. The Indian Community in Lisbon is not too big. Finding him shouldn't be a problem. Thank you. Sir, should I mix some more? If you mix any more, he will be flying high. Enough. We have shoot in the morning. This set up is majestic, bro. If wejoin David Eapen, we can survive even without cinema in the future... You just want to find out how to become a slave, wherever you go! Dude, they've come. Look! Good evening everybody, and welcome to the party. Please make yourselves comfortable. Hey Henry! Hello! Hey! How are you? So glad you could make it, buddy. He's the one who stretched his hands and captured the star he wished for. Thanks so much for coming. Yeah. One minute. - Hi everyone. - Hi. We're meeting for the first time. But I know each one of you, very well. Hey! Come on, guys! Help yourselves with some drinks, huh! The people here hold Indians in very high regard. As artists who came from there, ...they think that you are all special people. Let it remain like that. They were all invited here, for a surprise. The veteran amongst you, Vishwan Uncle, will tell you about that. - This David Eapen sir.. - Sir? He didn't like being addressed as sir. Such humility! This David Eapen is crazy about cinema. Who gave the money to make a movie with my daughter as the heroine, ...without falling at anyone's feet? That's great! But sir, who is in such a high position in society... Sorry.. David Eapen.. ...came to me and asked me without beating around the bush, ...whether he could marry my daughter. I liked that. Anyone who loves an, would also love an artist. That's natural. But as a father who wants only her well being, ...I said okay. It's God's grace that we could break that happy news on this set ofours. It's the engagement now. The wedding will also happen here. The day after we reach back in Kerala after our shooting, ...we'll have a party. Congratulations, Mr. David. You're going to marry... not just an actress... ...but the dream of a generation. Thank you. I know that very well. Best wishes, David sir. - You're the hero, right? - Yes. Unfortunately, in this movie... ...there's not much scope for heroism. L-°"9 Way to go! He's smart! Solid! All right, friends. Let me introduce you... This is Tara. The jewel... in David's crown. Why don't you say something, sweetheart? You're going to marry a father... ...who trained a small girl to move when she hears 'action', ...and to stop when she hears 'cut'. And not me. You know how much I love your sarcasm. Com e. Let's dance. Can we have some music, please? Sweetheart, one moment. I'll be back. We took money and got a passport to hell, my boys! Portugal! Leave it, sir. His money... His woman... Let him marry, slit her throat, or do whatever... We should finish our movie, sir. Okay! Okay! Willietta... Look! A guy who's all bashed up. Where? Come on. Some parties here end like this. You have to start shoot tomorrow morning, right? If you go now, you can close your eyes for some time now. It's better to close your eyes. Hero! What's up? Dance rehearsal? This climate... I'm not so comfortable with this cold weather, Madam. The actual cold hasn't kicked in yet. How was your sleep? Was it okay? 6 AM here is 10.30 AM back in Kerala, right? So can't say that I woke up early. They have just left to find a new location. A permission problem for the location they fixed earlier. That's not the truth. The camera to shoot the movie, and the assistants bringing it... ...will reach only in the afternoon. They missed their connection flight. Williams & Siddique left to the location early. Everyone else has gone to roam around the town and do some shopping. Jai, if you're free... shall we go somewhere? Well... I know this city well. But... ...to go out... If you go straight and turn right, there's grand pa's cafeteria. We'll have a coffee from there, and board a taxi. Okay? It's not that, Madam. I don't have... ...any cash with me. Madam, I'll make a call back home and come. Hello, mom? It's me, Jayakrishnan. Hey! I don't know when this will get disconnected or go silent... So don't tell me anything, just listen to what I'm saying. I reached here and the journey was great. And yeah... Hello? Mom? This is the situation in a country which is comparatively cheaper in Europe. It's quite expensive to stay here, right? Don't worry, hero. No one will trouble you for an autograph here. It's not that. Don't you want coffee, Madam? You're calling me Madam to mock me, right? Or, are you planning to mock me regularly? I had a name to call you, in front of the camera. But after the director says 'Cut', we... ...are talking to each other for the first time, rig ht? I'm Sofia. Sofia Godfrey. Underworld Don Vincent Godfrey's only sister. I am Joseph Daniel. As usual, I'm an orphan. Why did you want to meet me, Joseph? Don't you want coffee, Sofia? We might be the only actors who play out the drama of cinema in real life. Small.. Small! Obrigado. (Thank you) ls alcohol called Obrigado here? Nice! Are you planning to start in the morning itself? Obrigado means Thank You. And... ...morning is the best time to start. Especially when there's a whole day to get bored. It's not enough to visit a lot of places & meet the people, to understand a place well. You should drink the alcohol made in that place. It's made out of the hot sun, the snow and the blood that was shed on this soil. That's what is in this bottle. Saude! (Cheers) If you had told this to me earlier, I wouldn't have ruined my tummy drinking this black coffee. So what say, hero? Shall I direct this from here onwards? Saude. Let's go then. Take the rest with you. '0 breeze that comes secretly and whizzes around flinatiously, tell me' '0 breeze, that has the twinkling of the anklet bound by hearts, fill me up' ' Let's flow, enjoying the sweet delicacies of the snow capped city' 'Rubbing shoulders with you, matching steps with smiles, let's paint different colours' '0 beautiful moon' ' Come with me' '0 beautiful moon' 'A desire to flutter around every flower, endlessly as butterflies' 'A desire to see the rain's home, perched on a branch of the sky' ' Let's build a bracelet for the night sticthing stars on a thread ' 'The heart becomes a flight of dreams, to fly high' 'Adesire that blooms to get drenched in your mischievous smile' 'Adesire to shine bright like bubbles going round and round in the sky' '0 beautiful moon' 'Come with me' '0 beautiful moon' Don't forget to take the gift. Pay the taxi fare. Fare? First day... Best show! Go upstairs! Acoun has assembled there to hang you to death. Why? Oh Goddess! You brought my daughter back! Dear... Where were you all this while? She said there was no shoot... (Speaking in Portuguese) Who told you there was no work? The police is looking for you all around this town. Policia. Now I've to call them & settle them. That's also my job now. Dude... I swear, I didn't know! Dude, she put you in trouble! To get back at him, for making her dance in front of all his people. If you're not there, the shoot won't happen, right? Mr. Jai... David sir has summoned you. Go! I will decide where I'm going, when I should come back and who I'm going with. I don't have to tell you all that. You can't afford to do that, sweetheart. I don't care. Okay? Did you open the gift? She can throw and break anything in this room. Because... ...since yesterday, ...all this belongs to her as well. But she doesn't have the right to do just one thing. To abandon me. Because... I've made her my own. She threatened that she would commit suicide. Then I said I'll help her. It's that anger, which is lying broken here. The mischief that she did today... I'll forgive that. Siddique told me that you didn't have any role in it. She also had the same thing to tell me. Fix one thing in your mind. If you set out for anything like this again... I swear... ...that will be your last day in cinema. Sir, I know that you're not a fresh money-bag who set out to make a movie, ...because you were attracted to a girl. For me, who was back home with my mind full of cinema dreams, ...you gave such an opportunity, and I'm grateful for that. But... The future that you said you'll destroy... I don't have any concerns about it, sir. I'm able to stand here on my own feet, because of all those years of losses and struggles. I'd like to go fon/vard... So... So please don't drag me into the climax of your love story. I agree! What happened today, was due to my ignorance. So, such a thing won't happen again, with my knowledge. 'Who are you?' 'The star etched by the night?' 'Who are you?' 'The beautiful rainbow?' 'My heart is melting' 'It's a cloud of moonlit love' 'I'll pour down as a rain, within you' 'As the sea-like silence searches for words ' 'We're getting to know each other, for the first time' 'You join me slowly, as the beginning of a song' 'As I become the verse of the song' 'You join me slowly, as the beginning of a song' 'As I become the verse of the song' 'Who are you?' 'Who are you?' Cut. Are you angry at me, hero? Did you open the gift? What is this? Mimo. It's the first pre-paid phone in the world. You don't have to go looking for phone booths anymore, to call back home. It has the money to make calls until you leave from here. I'm happy to receive gifts. Tomorrow... he will become our manager, friend, calendar and alarm clock! Aconstant companion. My friend... ' Each season changes ' 'For you to bloom as a flower within me' Shall I try sincerely? 'My heart is melting' - Master, shall we go for a take? - Okay, sir. Okay! Ready! 'I'll pour down as a rain, within you' Sound! 'My heart is melting' 'It's a cloud of moonlit love' 'I'll pour down as a rain, within you' Okay! Cut! I tried, sincerely. Didn't happen. She seems to be an edgy, jumpy girl. My good fortune, that she was stuck in my arms somehow. - OthenNise... - Bull's eye! First she poured me a drink & got me into a bottle. And today, the film might have been stuck in the cans. Watch out, Williettaa... This is the last time. Her damn jump! I'll finish it today once and for all. I'm telling you out of experience, son. You have a great future ahead. See to it that she doesn't cling on to you. Com e. Hold this. What happened? It isn't working? If you had jumped off a second earlier, ...you wouldn't be here now. I'm standing here on my feet, after striving for a whole lifetime. Don't destroy that. 'Is love painful, or is it sweet? ' ' There's a fire in my heart that I cannot see' ' Each season changes ' 'For you to bloom as a flower within me' 'With all my beauty' Good morning hero. Didn't you say that you're always happy to receive gifts? Sofia must have called to say that there's no shoot in the morning, right? Not just to say that shoot witll happen today, ...but also to say that Sofia will be a good girl hereafter. This movie needs to happen, for you more than me. Saude. 'You join me slowly, as the beginning of a song' 'As I become the verse of the song' On the day the shoot packs up here, you should do me a favour. I'll leave from here only after getting it done. Will you go away with my thumb? Don't worry. There won't be any bloodshed. Let me see. (Singing an old Malayalam song) They are partying here, after working hard for a whole day. Only if you drink out of their pockets, will you be able get over the fatigue of having spent one more day without doing any work? Didn'tl buy booze for you, with the money you got by claiming a good price for me? Get up and come. Vishwettaa... I'm all right. Hold me. (Singing again) Get in. Your head... I should have done this earlier. I'm sorry. Was this Sofia... or Tara? You needn't have any doubts. Good night. Jai, I had asked you for a favour, right? Don't forget that. On the day the shoot ends, ...after the pack-up, I'll demand it. Don't break the promise you gave me. Saude. Saude. Will it be something like 'Muddugau' (Kiss)? In the bus? 'Who are you?' Are you stalking me? Yes... I'm not going to complain. Your wish. I just found out about your friend, Mr. David Eapen. His family runs a popular resto-bar in Chiado. It opens at 9. Thanks. Mathura, are you... Are you single? Tonight? I am! Pick me up at nine. Thank you! Thank you! Enlblf, everyone! Pedro, my love! Thanks. Hey Hima. Someone's waiting for you. Where? Outside. Okay. Thanks. I'll just be back. I can't believe my eyes! You're really here? Wait! Wait! What do I call you? Jai? Uncle? What did you call me all these years? - Cuss words. First rate cuss words! Oh my God! _ okay. _G°d! Why didn't you come meet me so far? Yeah, Yeah! Who is this? This is Mathura. She is a nun at a convent nearby. I can see that from her face! 30 Euros? Make it a little higher. Looks like you need some space. Yes. Need space! - Mathura, this is... - It's okay. I'll take a cab back. See you tomorrow at the hotel. Thank you for the lovely evening. - Good night. - Good night. My daddy Mr. David Eapen is allergic to Portugal now... ever since his second marriage. He escaped saying that he's going to Zurich... ...to celebrate the birthday of his 2nd son Brian born out of that disaster. He must be at some Casino, hugging Chinese girls. He can squander away the money he got when the company shut down. But 'Amour'... I am entitled to it. I won't let him mess around with that. What are you staring at? Malayalam? I can only talk in Malayalam. Don't ask me to read or write! I can repeat all the dialogues you said & the songs you sang, in the past 20 years, like a parrot! Hey! I'm not exaggerating! I am your biggest fan in the world! Thanks to mum. Tara. Hima... I need to talk to you. Peacefully. There's only one place in the world which is more peaceful than this. Confession box. Wanna go there? I don't have that many sins in my account. I've heard them all bursting out loud within a heart... ...while I used to sleep with my head on my mother's chest. I came here to.. I need to... ...talk to Tara. Oops! Tara is no more! But you came here at the best timing, hero. It's her death anniversary, day after tomorrow I should disturb her at least once a year, right? L am going-. If you're planning to come along, I'll come & arrest you myself, tomorrow morning. Hey! You look kinda' sexy with those greys! Don't hang around here much. The girls here are not that decent. Come on! Come on! Come on! See you soon. Okay guys! Gimme' five! Right! She has fallen in love with you! Girls of your age would feel so. For her, I am the India that her father misses. (Speaking in Portuguese) Come on! So what am I? Sir, my dad and mum; both are Indians. She doesn't feel anything seeing me, right? You are a true-blue Portuguese, right? A Paranky (Portuguese), who is full of football, hip-hop, cinema, wine, violence and a little madness as well. You can modify that name and make it Panky. Panky! Sounds kinky! Let's go! There was an unspoken agreement between me and Tara... ...that we would never cross each others' paths. But as time passed... ...I never imagined that she would do something drastic like this, in your form. But we are two different people. Tara was an artist. I myself don't know what I am! There's just one thing that I know. You! David? They... ...lived together for four years. When they separated, ...he got my custody, ...because he was more powerful! But Mumma held on here, until I came back. 'Anuyathra' (Accom panying) Your first film. That was the only thing Tara asked David, ...as her wedding gift! Pack up and wrap! The last shot of my first movie. Pack-up Pan!!- All of us celebrated late into the night, until we were all out of our senses. In between all the goodbyes, what she came and told me... ...became the beginning of an unforgettable journey. You gave me your word. A promise you made to a friend. 9.30 The booth near the cafeteria. You must reach there. By relation... I'm your big daddy!!! (Dialogue from Shahenshah) We are going... Where? Mad rid. Madrid? Such an instance won't happen again, with your knowledge. Whom did you promise that to? To David Eapen sir. You were here? I was practising my dialogue.. Dude, this movie is over. I'll tell you the story of my next movie! - Come. - Not now, sir. No, sir. He's already too drunk. I'm not too drunk! - I'll tell you. - That's all right. He hasn't gone overboard. Come on, walk. Walk! Hey! Come! Go, lie down. Good night then! Go to sleep! Bro! What happened? There's a... There's a problem. It was during that night... ...that our lives changed forever. I asked Siddhu for his opinion. Till date, ...among all the decisions that he had made for me, ...the only decision that went wrong... ...was that one. I don't remember when he left... ...or when I went to sleep. She was already prepared for that journey. Get up! - Get up - What? Who? Where are we...? Com e. 'We're speeding away, on a magic palanquin' 'On a journey' 'Me through you' 'And you through me' ' Speeding away, on this journey' 'The paths of the past are disappearing far away ' 'We are continuing the journey through the present' 'We're speeding away, on a magic palanquin' 'On a journey' ' Far away ' ' Far away ' ' Far away ' ' Far away ' ' Far away ' Tara! Tara! Tara! Tara! Tara... Tara! Taral! Tara! Tara! Tara! Oh God! Did someone die here? I've kept a back-pack in that car. Take it and come. This... Which is this place? No idea! This is where the road ended as I kept driving. I remember hearing something about Madrid. Madrid! That... It won't take much time for David to find out that I took tickets to Madrid. Because... it's me who wanted him to know it like that. They will go and search in Madrid. Hey! So... But now.. Tell me which this place is. I don't know! You don't know? Or you won't say it? There are just two ways. One is the way we came, and the other is the way forward. Your choice! Anyway, we've set out, right? I've only gone forward always. Tara... How did she die? No one bothered to find out how she lived, right? Then why should you know how she died? Why do you care? For the surprise that she was... I do care! There's a road down there now. We can drive! Destiny is asking us to choose between south, north or west. Either left or right. There are just two ways. Just a minute. Left if it's heads, right if it's tails. Left. - Shall we go? - Okay! My dear daughter... Why did you do this to me? Feels like someone is with us, right? For howmuch he drank yesterday, my dad wouldn't have woken up yet. You & your mimicry! This bag is so damn heavy! Didn'tl say that I'll carry my own bag? Why did you offer to help me? What the hell is in this? Hey! Don't open it! - Don't open it! Give it to me. - Let me see. Let me see! So you called me along, to steal David Eapen's entire wealth and run away? I'll tell you something! Even if I have to support a murder, I won't support a theft. I don't want even a penny from this! I don't want to go to Madrid. I just want to go home. Theft? Did you say theft? Me? I stole? Yes. Theft is really bad, dear. - Even Jesus Christ... - Stop it. I came after leaving double these ornaments back home. Shouldn't I get stuff something into your mouth, when you're hungry? From that, get me a necklace of 2 sovereigns, and a 2 Euro note as munchies. Don't make me... Can't find even a single soul here. I'm so thirsty! Then stop talking and walk! I think we've lost our way. You were the one who chose to go left. Hello! Keshavan won't show us the wrong way. Who is Keshavan? The reason behind everything - Aadi Keshava Perumal, from Kerala. Follow me! Since we turned left, we had to walk 4-5 kilometres extra. If we had turned right, we would have reached this road. Should we go back & take this route again? That's not necessary. We will stay here tonight. Then we'll get up in the morning, and continue running away. Hows that? Well madam, what kind of programme is this? Honeymoon celebrations? Don't have such hopes anyway. But if the hero expects to go on a rampage through this forest once it gets dark, ...don't expect the heroine's company for that programme. Nice. Great wood. How do we open this? BY Paying money. Got the key as well. Mumma really loved this place. Certain things she loved a lot... She went out of her way to make it hers. Yeah! She bought this too. She didn't come here very regularly. But, she used to like to come and sit here. What's the plan? Murder? I just wanna cook for you. Supper? I saw this cabin for the first time, in a magazine article. Juan Rodriguez. A painter. His girlfriend Melina. She was an artist. This place was their favourite tenting spot. During one of Juan's painting sessions, ...Melina who went into the mist of the lake, never returned. He searched for several days. He hasn't accepted her death till date. This is a cabin he built with his own hand, for Melina. If ever she returns one day... ...to stay along with her. Nice. Great story. It's a perfect item to be published in a magazine. This is not a story, Jai. This is the most romantic background in the Portuguese an circle. This lake, this sky and this cabin. It's because you don't know these foreigners too well. Even if it's a black rock, they will make a story about it, to get it sold, ...and then they will add plenty of masala to it. It's only their food that doesn't have salt or spice. Then shalll... ...tell you something that's not a story? My story- Not to you. To what we see here. This wine has a speciality. I'll tell you. If you could say it soon, ...we can start eating. It's actually sweet. This bottle of wine... Mumma had saved it for you. A 1971 Alentejo. From your birth-year. Did Tara know thatl would come back one day? No. Tara knew that you would never come back. Saude. Saude. Hero! Cycle! Where are you off to on a cycle, early in the morning? To buy milk? It's been 5 hours since early morning. I've brought a cycle for you as well. Shouldn't we cross the forest before dark? Hello! I understood that this passport belongs to Eapen sir. But in yesterday's bonfire... ...how did this land up between all the firewood? While leaving the country, ...he shouldn't come searching for me so quickly, right? That's why... Come! Hey Madam! We crossed the forest before dark, ...and the concert has started as well. You didn't tell me what's the plan yet. Oh my God! I'll go give the cabin's key there, and be right back. They said that the trucks that pass through this road in the night, ...stop near the Church usually. To pray to St. George. Juan said that we can hitch a ride on one of them. You go ahead and try. What did you teach Siddhu as the biggest weapon an actor needs? Not words or looks.. Then what? His hands and body. Try forgetting your hands and body, to arrange something. I'll do great. Where are you going? The truck will come here. You won't let me pee also? Obrigado. (Thank You) Okay. Come fast. They will leave now. Chetta, wait... One minute. Where does this go? I'll tell you. Come. Hop on! Where does this go? I don't know where it goes to, but this is the last truck. Chet-ta, let's go! Go! Go! Hello! What is it? What's there to laugh so much? You look like a bakery sweet thatl don't like at all. Which is that item? Dilkush. You also look the same. The only difference is that it was made last Christmas. Where is this? Not even a street food shop around. Which is this place? This is Viseu, man! David Eapen's headquarters. He has a vineyard here. Will we be in trouble? I don't know. I am hungry. I'll make arrangements. How? We'll knock on the first door we see. And we'll push it open. And we'll push it open. Come here. Oh my God! Move! (Crowd cheering for Spain & Portugal) There's a bathroom over there. Go there and change your clothes. What? There! There's a bathroom over there. Go there, and change your clothes. - Over there, right? - Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me! Seriously? Which side? Portugal or Spain? Portugal or Spain? Portugal or Spain? Portugal or Spain? Spain! - Portugal. - Yes! Yes! - Portugal. - No! Not me! _ fipain! “mam! Spain! Brother! Jai! Who scored the goal? One minute. - These girls! - Hmmm. Yeah! First go and wash your mouth. Go and wash your mouth. Why? I saw her puking into that commode. You deserve it! Come on! You must take this! No! No! No! Yeah! Yeah! Let's do that! Even our own mothers won't recognize us in this look. If Spain wins this match, even they won't recognize us. Why? Portuguese guys will play soccer with our heads. Then we'll escape in the Spaniards' vehicle. They caught a van and came here to sell stuff! What stuff? Paracetamol. Hey! That... But that's... Brother who gave me the pill? She took the pill. Hey! (Speaks in Portuguese) (Speaks in Portuguese) (Speaks in Portuguese) (Speaks in Portuguese) Oh no! Come! Come! Chetta, sorry! Come with me, I say! Move! Move away! Come! This looks like a way to hell. Wait! Wait! One minute. Just one minute, Chetta. Come! Run! This way! Move. What is that for? Throw it away! This way... - Wipe it. Com e. Stop! Stop! Come here... Switch it on! Come! Oops. Light? Just a minute. I can see everything! Where is this... Nice! On one side, David, the villain who can come in anytime; On the other side, some Portuguese goons who want to play soccer with our heads. But neither of them is my real enemy now. You're doing all this seeing what, Tara? Seeing you! The way you look at me... Your... Your gaze... ...is not inside my dress. When you look at me, ...I don't feel disgusted. You're out of your senses... I was out of my senses! Until 2 days back. As my skin is whipped with a belt or rattan, I'm asked to laugh. Sol should laugh then. Then I'm asked to flirt. Sol should flirt then. I was out of my senses ever since I was taught all that. But... Didn't you hold me close that day? I felt it then... The sense of what I truly am... ...started coming back to me from that day. That moment... During that moment, I felt... One chance.. Just... one chance. I felt like living! Shall I ask you something? On the day you receive the greatest gift in your life, ...what will you tell the world? Say it. Say m I was an ordinary young man for whom acting was a desire, and cinema was a dream. There wasn't any guarantee that I would be able to achieve it, ...at any point during my struggle for it. When I stood in front of the camera for the first time, ...eliminating all the darkness within me, ...two eyes opened before me. The actor in me was born, in those eyes. I saw my first viewer in those eyes. That hand which held my stretched out hand, ...was the first award I ever received. Today... Like this gift in my hand... Those eyes, and that hand... I'll remember them until I die. Thank you. Tara... Taral! Tara, I... This moment... This is my right! Just this one moment. Can't you give it to me? 'The moment when the eyes meet each other' 'The moment when the bodies understand each other' 'Love is like a burning ember' 'I'll snow down upon your hands, for this whole lifetime' 'Spread all around, as the golden light of my lamp' 'You are my life' 'Like a river' 'My summers have turned moist for the first time, my dear' 'Flow through my nerves' 'As you touch me like a lightning, my mind awakens' 'You are my life' 'Sparks of fire wrote dreams in our hearts' 'We are clouds that mate, never stopping the shower' 'I shall turn into the eyelashes on this eye' 'I shall pour down as water droplets' 'I'll snow down upon your hands, for this whole lifetime' 'Shine all around, as the golden light of my lamp' 'You are my life' 'Like a river' 'My summers have turned moist for the first time, my dear' 'Flow through my nerves' 'As you touch me like a lightning, my mind awakens' 'You are my life' 'Like a river' I have two tickets with me. A cruise that starts from Porto. I can escape to a place that makes me the happiest. That last chance that God is giving me... The second ticket... ...is for you, Jai. I will never force you. The decision is yours. So you came back! Shall I? Please. Viseu. What brings you to my home town? Mr. David Eapen, no meal of mine is complete without thanking you. For all the nights we didn't meet till date, Thank you! And after 20 long years, ...you came back, ...for her! There's a correction in what you just said. I came back... ...for myself. You killed every hope I built around her. Now Hima? By going behind her... ...if you're trying to defeat me again... I spared you once. I'll have to make you disappear from our lives forever. The world has changed so much... So much time has passed... Yet, the old estate owner within you isn't dead, Eapen. I came back to this land... ...to bid farewell to Tara. As I'm leaving after saying that, ...there's something that I always wanted to tell you. Good bye... ...and good night, David. Hold on. Glass of water, no ice. Are you jealous? Neven Come on! You're jealous! Admit it. No, I'm not. Then come dance with me. No. Come on. Just one dance? Please! Com e. Just once. Just this one time. I need it. Com e. I need it! You're lying... ...to yourself! I didn't come here because I was getting insecure sitting in that hotel alone. I don't want to see this drama as well. Your dad had come... ...looking for you. He has never even dared to call me. Why do you have such a father allergy? Usually it's exactly the opposite for girls, right? I've never had him whenl needed him. Whenever I tried to pull him closer... ...he has only pushed me away. Why don't you give him another chance? After all, he's your own father, right? It's that donkey who should understand that, right? Shall I talk to him? Just hug me! Hey! 'Is this smile fading away?' 'As the spoken words are getting broken' 'Tears are flowing from the moist eyes' 'There are different paths ahead for us, now' 'Your footsteps on the sand' 'Are erased by the waves in a jiffy' Tara! 'A rapture is spreading' 'It's time for us to pan ways' 'This night is disappearing far away, slowly' Where did you go? Where were you all this while? So much tension? When you didn't see me for a couple of hours? Well... Com e. I'll show you something. 'When grief surrounds me all over' 'I am alone' 'Is this smile fading away?' 'As the spoken words are getting broken' 'Tears are flowing from the moist eyes' 'There are different paths ahead for us, now' Can you feel the freedom? At the same tomorrow, we will be surrounded by the ocean. 'Are erased by the waves in a jiffy' 'A rapture is spreading' 'It's time for us to pan ways' 'This night is disappearing far away, slowly' 'As each dream is shattered like clay statues' 'When grief surrounds me all over' 'I am alone' Tara... I'll just come. Well... Shall we... ...go to Madrid? There's a feeling within me... I wanted to express it to you. Don't we talk about someone who's within us? I felt like someone like that is saying that to me. Those cruise tickets from Porto? Throw them away. Let's... leave from here. Let's go straight to Madrid itself, from here. Are you done? Shall we go? Tara... Inna I was serious. Let's go straight to Madrid from here. But Jai, we don't have the time to change decisions at the last minute! Understand what I'm saying. If things don't happen as you've planned... Okay then. Ask your Keshavan. Heads for Porto. Keshavan is with me now. Shall we leave? Before that night ended, I was able to convince Tara to change her decision. Upon my promise that I'll be with her in all her journeys hereafter, we decided to leave to Madrid. 'When grief surrounds me all over' 'I am alone' Airport. Aero-Po r10... Tara! Tara, we don't have time. Come. Let's go. Since we've decided to go, ...don't stall the ritual. Before this journey of ours starts, ...throw something which is most precious to you, ...into this. That's the belief here. Done, right? I've been carrying it with me for 20 years. Com e. Let's go now. Tara! The life that I dreamt of until now, was on these two pieces of paper. To live hereafter, I have a new dream. Tara... Com e. Where? Come fast. Fast! Tara... Get into the car. Jai... Tara, get into the car! Hey! Follow them immediately. Come on! Quick! Press some more. Step on it! Go! Go! Overtake the damn car! Here. Look at me. If you threw what's most precious to you over there, your dream... ...will definitely come true. You should go back. Achieve everything that you can. The debt of these three days that you gave me... ...I can't repay it however much I try. Enough. Let's go. So dude... Tara descended beneath the earth, over here. Her dreams became ashes. Here. Her greatest desire... was YOLII' success. And now here you are... ...at the same fountain, ...and you are a superstar!! So you've repaid your debt to Mumma. Let's head back? Let's go! My debt still remains, Hima. To whom? I betrayed her. If I hadn't called him, ...David wouldn't have reached here, ever. Hers... ...was a perfect plan. The happiness she had believing that I gave her those three days... ...was a lie I acted out, for a promise I made to David. On the night that journey began... I quoted a price and sold... her love, which I never deserved. Hey! Hey! Get up! Get up, man! Where? Get up, I say. With what confidence... ...are you asking me not to stop her? Say it. Tell him, man. She can escape from you at any point in life, right sir? How long will you stop her? How long will you keep her locked up? Do you have any guarantee that she won't try to do this again? Trust me, sir. The journey that she's starting now... ...will end up back in front of you, finally. The route that Tara planned from that Church... ...I didn't go wrong there. I took the wrong route deliberately. I'll do great. Where are you going over there? The truck will come here. You won't even let me pee or what? Hey! Sir... She's not planning to go to Madrid. She hasn't told me where yet. On the route to some highway... ...there's a Church of St. George. We are there now. Okay. Viseu. That's where you have to reach. Viseu? This is Viseu, man! David Eapen's headquarters. But... ...I understood what Tara had in mind... ...only when I saw those cruise tickets in her bag. Hello. Bro, it's me. Hey! Dude... my heart is not letting me betray her, man! Isn't it agrave sin? To betray the one who trusted and came along with me? Dude, shouldn't this movie release? You promised David sir yourself, right? Either she'll ditch you and go... ...or else, you'll just be a trophy husband. I'll decide what needs to be done. - You just obey what I say. When I heard thatl should ask Tara for forgiveness, in Siddhu's voice at the hospital... I heard the same thing that my conscience had told me a thousand times. Apart from the fact that she's living somewhere happily... ...I had neverwished to hear any other news about her. Just before spitting it out, you blewa big bubble... ...and burst it in ajiffy; this confession of yours, hero. But you, who has performed excellently in so many confession scenes, ...couldn't do this well. You can be a little more dramatic. A poor girl... ...carried only you in her hean, for a good pan of her lifetime. Shucks! Not just her... You destroyed a good childhood thatl deserved, as well. Thank you. The greatest burden in the world... ...is the memory of a sin that one committed deliberately. On that day... ...the most precious thing that I left behind over there... wasn't Keshavan's silver coin. It was your mother. Whatever he achieves... ...there's only one thing that can never be replaced, once a man loses it... His woman! No. I won't die. Whichever corner of this earth you may hide in... someone will come before you. Astar that shines red with our love, that you severed. We meet again! Mr. Joseph Daniel. Sorry. For 20 years... ...I held on to that word, never saying it to anyone. When she said that you're gone... ...I thought it must be the punishment that time sentenced for me. I can't, anymore. I'm sorry. The old Jai... ...wasn't so melodramatic. It's okay. That suspense... David broke it back then itself. Sir... I don't want anything. Money, the new movie, nothing! Instead, can you do me a favour? Tara... She shouldn't know... manything! Ever! Of course. Don't think that he has done such a huge sacrifice for you. He was the one who called and informed me that you were here. I know. When he called you... ...I was with him. Happy Birthday, Mumma! Well, I've brought him here after a lot of difficulty. Your birthday gift. Now don't damage your heart by holding back whatever you want to say, and blurt it out on to his face! I wanted to give it back to him for what I suffered for 10-15 years, but... ...it didn't happen. It's all right. There's still time. Mr. David Eapen did his job neatly. I don't know, maybe it's the gratitude for granting him divorce decently. So, my role is getting done here. Okay? I forgot one thing. Here you go. Cruise tickets. I bought it with the money I made by singing at the top of my voice. Now don't tear these as well. So... Boa Noite. (Good night) Bon voyage! Adieu! (Good bye) The anger I felt for you back then, disappeared... ...when I saw David losing in front of the lie I told him. He hasn't got an opportunity to win after that. Ever! His right as the parent of Hima, before the society. The poor guy's only request was not to deny him that. Hima? She is not my daughter. She was a brat born to some... ...Joseph Daniel, ...and an innocent girl called Sofia Godfrey. When we parted ways, ...you had so many hopes and desires before you, Jai. And I had nothing. But... I didn't know then that you had given me the biggest hope in my life. You gave me hope, ...and I named her Hima. What did you call me all this while? - Cuss words. First-class cuss words. I don't have that many sins in my account. I've heard them all bursting out loud within a heart... ...while I used to sleep with my head on my mother's chest. Your dad had come. He has never even dared to call me. Why do you have such a father allergy? I never had him whenl needed him. Why don't you give him another chance? After all, he's your own father. It's that donkey who should understand that, right? This night which stitched together what was severed... ...I can't thank it enough. None of us have the right to separate what God bound together, Tara.
