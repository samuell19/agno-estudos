♪ Fixed & Synced by bozxphd.Enjoy The Flick ♪ MAN: Davenport to serve. ( TENNIS RACQUETS STRIKING BALLS ) ( MAN GRUNTS ) Out! MAN ♪2: What? Oh, my god. That was in. Be honest. Dude, you saw that. That was right on the line. Seriously? Call stands. Brad, that ball was on the line. Please don't do this to me. Jimmy, he made the call, and i confirmed. You're really gonna take his side? Look at him. Does he look like a man who can see? After we went to elegant girls that time, you're gonna fuck me over on this? It was out. I never told your wife. ( WHISPERING ) And as I've said numerous times before, i went back to the hotel room alone after getting one dance in the champagne room. I don't believe you fucked a stripper, man. That is a terrible, terrible idea. Do not do that again. Is it too hard to get a hawkeye camera up in this shit? Serve the ball, long-shorts. ( BELCHING ) Whoo! ( LAUGHS ) Dude, would you cheer up, please? We made the quarters. That's four grand each. We lost, Jimmy. I thought i could learn from playing with a journeyman. Five minutes after the match, you're drinking a beer. Well, this is actually gin that i just poured into an empty beer can because i couldn't find a cup. ( CHUCKLES ) Well, you can drink all you want now, Jimmy, 'cause we are done. ( BELCHES ) ( SHOUTING, CHEERING ) Hey, Mr. price. Oh, hey, Barry. So Mrs. whist will be back from sabbatical next year. You should try to sub for seventh grade, so you can be my teacher again. Let's not get crazy, Barry. Seventh grade's a little out of my league. So, uh, if you're a substitute teacher, then you're technically unemployed right now. Uh... Yeah, yeah. So you want to hang out this summer? Oh... yeah, I'm gonna be busy. Oh. With what? With a lot of stuff, you know. With all those... Things. Here, let me get the door for you. Oh. Thanks, Barry. Yeah. All right. I'm gonna go this way now, so... Okay. You have a good summer. Yeah, you too. See you, Mr. price. What up, Linda? ( RINGING ) Here we go. JIMMY: Hey, dad, guess what? I give up. What? I made the quarterfinals at the corona classic with that kid, Davenport. Yeah, good for you. Thank you, good for me. And then the kid dropped me. ( CHUCKLES ) You know? Oh, well. Talking about, it's time for me to hang it up. Now? But you've only been playing tennis for eight years too long. Fire her, dad. So, if hanging it up is what you want to do... No, dad, no. I'm not hanging it up. I'm gonna make a run at the open, actually. Great, if that's what you want to do. It is what i want to do. It's just... It's hard to find a good partner. What do you think about me asking Darren? Uh... Wow. Yeah, that'd be... When's the last time you even saw Darren? What do you mean? Like, i saw him... When did i see him? He's recently single, so he might be looking for something to do. Just don't pull another dash Stevens, okay? Dad, that was 15 years ago. Come on. What's a dash Stevens? It's a "who," not a "what." Dash Stevens was this hotshot pro that Jimmy left Darren for when he hit the pro circuit. They played doubles together. Jimmy looking out for himself over his own brother? Nah. I don't believe it. Quit defending your not-so-secret admirer. Jimmy... What? Quit flicking Brock's penis. Fine. What are you, 12? ( MOTOR WHIRRING ) Hey, Mr. price! I thought you were busy this summer. Go home, Barry. No, that's what I'm saying, dude. It gives you a mental edge. Okay. How do you do it? You just shove it down your pants in the middle of... Ugh. No. That would scare kids. What you do is, prior to the match even starting, you cut a little hole in your pocket. Right? Cut a little hole in your pocket. That way, every time you go to serve the ball, you know that that ball has grazed your scrotum. And your opponent, when they're hitting the ball, they're hitting your scrotum ball, okay? And now you own that man. Now you're one up on him. Yeah. 'Cause he's your bitch 'cause he's hitting your scrotum ball. Right? Dude, the stuff you're doing with your scrotum is light-years ahead of what everyone else is doing right now. Thank you so much. That means a lot. No, i mean it, man. 'Cause a lot of people don't appreciate it. Consider yourself appreciated. Thank you. That's cool of you to say, man. Would you please give me a couple of the prestige pro? String them tight this time. 59-57. Jimmy, i... What? I can't. Nicky, give me some head. Give you... 'Cause of the... That's cool. I like that... I love that joke. My manager told me that i can't give you any more free stuff. Are you telling me head's dropping me right now? Uh-uh. I'm not telling you that, 'cause they don't... They don't sponsor you. I'm just starting to train for the open, Nick. And head's dropping me now? That's ridiculous! Yeah, they are. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. I could loan you my racquet. Honestly, dude, just take my racquet. It'd be an honor. Just take it. Yeah! All right, whoo! Believe in yourself, Jimmy. You're gonna win it, man! Hit me up if you ever want to kick it, like, on the weekends or whatever. Hey. Hey, Mr. price. What are you doing now? Listen, Barry, school's out. Which means I'm just a 33-year-old man, and you're an 11-year-old boy, so we're not hanging out. What kind of car is this? This car is a kia sorrento. Cool. How much does it cost to buy a kia sorrento? I didn't buy it. I'm leasing it. What's that mean? It means that i am kind of renting it for a really, really long time. Why would you lease a kia sorrento? I don't know, Barry. Sometimes things are sadder in retrospect. What's this? Dreamcatcher. Cool. Catch a lot of dreams? Just the sorrento, so far. Hmm. Uh, where'd you get it? Uh, it's my girlfriend's. My ex-girlfriend. "Ex-girlfriend"? What happened? I don't want to talk about that. Was she cramping your style? Nope. Did she have too much baggage? Did your mom hate her? No, she never met my mom. Why not? My mom passed away. Oh, man. How'd she die? Okay. Yeah, Barry, you know, you got to have more tact. Oh. Sorry. Um... How'd she die? That was much better. Okay. Here we are. Okay, Barry. Have a good summer. Bye, friend. Thanks for the ride. Mm-hmm. Hi, grandma. Hi, sweetie. Thank you, Mr. price. So hey, man, listen. The alerian open's, like, three months away, and I'm just trying to figure out who I'm gonna partner with, and going through the list, your name popped up on the list, so i was just... MAN: Well, yeah, um... Yeah? No, i was saying, "well, yeah," like, "well, yeah," but not "yeah," yeah. Yeah, no, it's not a good idea. So no. Oh, yeah, no. No, i didn't... Oh, yeah. I'm talking about alerian open. I'm talking about going the full distance, buddy. What do you think about that? Yeah, i think... You remember, you turned me in to the officials before a match for smoking weed in '03? Right? Right. Weed that you sold me? Shitty weed that you sold me? ( BEEPS ) JIMMY: You're a fucking pro at a country club, dude? MAN: Yeah, six figures, bro. And you're just not playing on the tour anymore? You're not in the game? Yeah, I'm married with kids. Leo's four now. It's crazy. JIMMY: Oh, my god. You're like that dude in the white shirt at the... country club. Hey, long-shorts. What's up? It's Jimmy p. Jimmy p. Your butt still hurting from corona? Super funny as always, Jimmy. JIMMY: So listen, man, I've been trying to narrow down a partner, and i think we should talk about getting back together. LONG-SHORTS: Why don't you swing on out to the house? All I'm focused on now is getting to palm Springs to win the quallies and getting into the open. Yeah, man, me too. Me too. If we stick together, we can totally make that shit happen. You got a lot of nerve, I'll give you that. What do you... What do you mean? You're 35. You're begging a 21-year-old. I'm just saying, that takes a lot of balls. Ah... Desperation or... Is it very low self-esteem? Guess I'm gonna have to say "no way in hell." You could've told me that on the phone instead of making me drive all the way out to this weird plantation. Happy retirement, buddy. See you in palm Springs, bitch. ( MOTOR WHIRRING ) A "lidda hepp"? "A lidda hepp"? A lidda hepp? ( SIGHS ) Barry, the phrase is "a little help." Oh. I thought it was a Norwegian saying. Okay. All right. Do you see that box diagonally across from us? Uh-huh. Okay, i want you to take a ball, i want you to hit it underhand into that box, like this. Okay? That's a serve. You do that with every ball here, and when you're done, go pick up all the balls and then bring them back to this line and do it again. Got it? Okay. Got it. I got one in! No talking. I hit five good serves in the box in a row. I'm like Kobe Bryant. Kobe plays basketball. Yeah, i know. I meant that I'm like, uh, the Kobe Bryant of tennis. Mm-hmm. I even have Kobe's shoes. See? Yeah, see, that just makes me think that you thought Kobe played tennis. My grandma bought them for me. Sounds good. And you live with her? Yeah? Yeah. So, tell me more about your mom dying. Barry, you cannot say stuff like that, you know? You... I'm sorry. It's just that my mom died, too. Her and my dad. I'm sorry. It's okay. Yeah, you know, my mom, she taught me how to play tennis before i could walk. I was actually pretty good. I won a couple of junior national tournaments with my brother. Why didn't you win any pro tournaments? I didn't go pro. My brother did. He won a few tournaments. Well, if you never called it quits, you could've been as good as Tiger Woods. Tiger plays golf. I know. I meant the Tiger Woods of tennis. ( CAR HORN HONKS ) Oh, hey, my ride's here. You, uh, want to come over and watch Harry Potter later? No, thank you. See you later, Mr. price. Bye. Hey, Barry... I'm gonna be here Thursday, same time, if you want to practice your serves. Yeah, cool. I'm... I'm like the Harry Potter of tennis. Yes. Yeah. ( CHUCKLES ) ( CAR ENGINE STARTS ) ( DOOR SHUTS ) ( GRUNTS ) ¶ My heart is lost ¶ ¶ these things mean nothing to me ¶ ¶ not to me ¶ ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS, EXCLAIMS ) ¶ I'm not sorry for being myself ¶ ¶ addiction, too tough to tell ¶ ( EXCLAIMING ) ¶ Too tough to tell ¶ DARREN: Who is it? Uh, it's Jimmy. Hey. Hey, man. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, i was just stopping by to check on my bro. Right. Uh... Can i come in? Yeah. Oh, so, hey, uh, congratulations are in order. Dad told me you broke up with Greta. Uh, it's "grace." Grace. That was her n... Wait, that was her name? Yeah, we went out for three years, so... ( LAUGHING ) That's awesome. Yeah, i just got out of a really bad relationship, too. Really? Hayes Davenport. No forehand. Real cocksucker. So now i don't have a bid for the qualifying tournament. Qualifying for what? I'm making a run at the open. ( CHUCKLES ) Right. Right. Yeah, so now i have to earn my way in through this upcoming pre-qualifying tourney. If i win that, I'm in the quallies at palm Springs. If i win at palm Springs, I'm in the open. Right. Cool. Yep. I just need a partner. Are you serious? ( BELCHES ) Yep. Jimmy... Hey, look. I think we can be kick-ass again. I think this is our chance to... I don't think so, man. To really fuck some shit up, you know? We could go out there, and we could really fuck some shit up. Jim, no. Sorry. Sorry, Jim. I forgot. I forgot what a fucking scaredy-cat you are. I did. It completely slipped my mind. You should be honest with yourself and me and just say, "I'm a scared little girl inside of a tall man's body." It's a waste of fucking time, man. This is your dream you fucked up, not mine, so... Is, is that it? Are we... Are we done? ( DOOR OPENS, SHUTS ) Overhand, huh? No biggie smalls. Can i hit balls from that tennis Cannon too? Nope. When was the last time you played against real people? It's been a while, but i actually just got an offer to play doubles again. With who? My brother. Awesome. You won tournaments with him. Junior tournaments, and he's an idiot. Yeah, but still, it'd be cool to see how good you guys are now. I mean, you have nothing to lose. I mean, your girlfriend left you. You're just a single, unemployed teacher. No, i get it. You're actually a substitute teacher. I mean, people always say that they have nothing to lose, but they actually have something to lose. You literally have nothing to lose. You don't have anything. Yeah, i get it. Like, the first, you know... Well, your, uh, your kia sorrento lease. Oh, that's a great point, Barry. Thank you. You're welcome. ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) If you didn't crush 'em so hard, a lot more would go in. Well, if i hit 'em underhand, i could get 'em all in. Just saying you could serve at 120 instead of 130, and 20% more of your serves would go in. Yeah, and I'm just saying if i served 'em underhand, i could get every serve in. Are you still leading all the tournaments in double faults? Yeah, and aces. And unforced errors? ( CHUCKLING ) This coming from the guy who once had a five-minute rally waiting for the other guy to screw up. I could've literally laid down on the court and taken a nap. We won that point. And we didn't win by my aces? Not your unforced errors. Dude, oh, my god. Your game is so fucking conservative. And yours is reckless. We would've won twice as many tournaments if you had any balls. I'm the only reason we won any tournaments, asshole. Right. So you're in? Yeah. I'm in. Hey, dad, what's this? It's for canine epilepsy. It's valium, basically. ( SIGHS ) Took him three times around the block, but he finally went. Well, if it isn't my little buddy. What's he still doing here? He's waiting for someone to adopt him. Well, you could put him to work in the meantime. There's a huge market out there for animal porn. I was not aware. Jack, I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks, Heather. Guess what? Tell me. Darren's in. Yeah, we actually drove over here to tell you together, but when he realized he'd have to see Heather, he bitched out. He lied and said he wanted to listen to "piano man" in the car. That's a good song. That's not the point, dad. ¶ So if you trust me ¶ ¶ hold me close and ¶ ¶ we'll turn the sculptures made of sand ¶ hey, stranger. Heather. Heather. ( HORN BEEPING ) What are you doing out here? I just... i was just... I was just listening to... Sorry. Hold on a second. Just listening to a song. It's a good song. And, uh... Are you here with Jimmy? Uh, yeah. Yeah, we're partnering up. That's fantastic. He was just saying he wants to make a run at the open. Yeah, i don't... I'm just excited to get some exercise, you know? Excuse me. Do you two happen to know where the mid-valley vet clinic is? Hi, Gary. Hey, baby. ( CHUCKLING ) Hey. Gary weeder. Darren. P-price. Darren price. Darren's Jack's son. Oh. Nice. So are you a vet, too? No, uh, a teacher. Oh. Nice. Wait, are you... Are you the hair guy? Like, the "comb the gray out"? Gary doesn't like that term, "hair guy." I'm the "right for men" co-spokesman. Oh. Sorry. I didn't, you know... Hey. You didn't know. All right, well, we should get going. Good to see you, Darren. Yeah, good to see you. Okay. All right, hey, later. Bye-bye. ( CAR STARTS ) See, when i go to net, you've got to go cross court. There's something about vhs. It's like listening to vinyl or jerking off to dad's playboys. Can you just pay attention for two more minutes? Are you kidding me? I can hardly take my eyes off myself. I was hot. Why didn't you tell me how good my ass looked while hitting a forehand? ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) Beautiful. I got to take this. Is it what's-her-nuts? ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah, i don't... I don't... I haven't seen your hair band thingies. I did look under the bed, grace. Yes. Yeah, i don't... I accept. Hello. Hey, baby. How are you? Uh, who are you? Where's Darren? The dream-catcher, yeah. I got the dream-catcher in my car. Did he contact you for masturbatory reasons? Lunch? I'm sorry. Who's asking? Really? This is amazing to know. So what happens? Do you... I've got so many questions. No freebies. Wow! I'm really busy this week. No, don't go. He's right... ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) Aw. "Vanessa78." Yeah, okay. Who were you talking to? Hmm? Oh, i was talking to my high-school self. I wanted to warn me about Jamie albright. She gave me crabs. Oddly, not as bad of a thing as one would think. Mm. Don't touch me. Putnam public is so much better than this shithole. This place is good. No one will bother us here. Yeah? Then who's that? Hi, Mr. price. Oh, that's Barry. He's like a ball boy. Hey, Barry. Barry, this is Jimmy. Jimmy, this is Barry. Hey, Jimmy. Barry. Where'd you get your outfit? The Kenneth Cole outlet. DARREN: So, i want to keep the racquets in the bag and do some footwork conditioning. What? Fuck that, man. Hey, watch your language around Barry. What? Barry knows I'm fucking around. Listen, you're fat, and we don't have a coach. Hey, hey. Can we just hit around for a little while, please? Fine. It looks like Katy Perry fucked Pinocchio. Oh, come on. Look, you've got to get it above the net. Barry, ball. ¶ Walking in the raindrops ¶ ¶ looking through the puddles at my feet ¶ ah! Come on! Sorry. Too much spin. Nice toss. ¶ i can see the white clouds ¶ ¶ airplanes and possibilities ¶ that dropped in. Barry, was that in? No. That's in. Sit down. You don't know what you're talking about. Play on. ¶ And i can see the birds flying ¶ ¶ making me think i should get away ¶ that's in! ( EXCLAIMS ) One more game, one more game. I'll play all night, bitch. Out. That's bullshit! That was in! Just take 10% off the ball, and we could have a rally. Quiet. Barry, give me the ball. Good throw, Barry. ( LAUGHS ) Nice shot! ( GRUNTING ) Oh, that's good. Yes! Putnam middle school, you feel me? Ball, Barry, ball. It went off the frame. We should still get a run in. Are you s... We just played for three hours, man. Jimmy, if you lost 10 pounds, you'd still be the fattest guy on the circuit. Dude, that's rude. I'm gonna go take a run... tubs. So, who's your favorite tennis man from the 1980s? Okay. Okay. Here you go. All right, let's just hit it around, get back in the old swing of things. No pressure, Jimmy, you know? Buddy, would you relax, please? This is just a sparring session. Don't count for shit. Hey, hi! Dad and Heather are here? Look at you. What? You've had a boner for her since the fifth grade, and you still haven't made a move. You want me to hook you up with that sweet ass? Yes, Jimmy. Right before our first match in 15 years, I'd like you to hook me up with that sweet ass. You guys ready? Yeah. Yeah, we're ready. Up. Yes! Bitches. All right, I'm gonna go down the "t" on both. I'll pooch on the second serve. It's not gonna get that far. I'm gonna Ace these fuckers. Just relax, okay? You relax. Good luck, guys. Yeah. Just making sure you're awake. You want some of this? Really? Second-serve Ace? Second-serve Ace. That good or bad? Both. Seriously? Can i play or what? This is not fun for me at all. Out. Wh-what? It was just about two inches wide. That was in. I'm calling it out. It's an honor system. Let it go. Okay. No, you're right. Good call, guys. Good eyes. Good eyes. Out. What? Sorry. That was a couple inches out. MAN: Are you kidding me? Hey, if Abercrombie and douche want to play like that, I'll play like that all day. Yeah, keep staring me down, Facebook. I got way more friends than you, trust me. Serve the ball. Those guys were fucking tools, bro. What the hell happened out there, huh? What happened was we lost to an unranked local team in a no-name tournament in the first round. So you want to qualify for the open? Look, man, you're not taking this seriously at all. What do you mean? If you want to qualify for the open, you can't drink like this, man. What? Do you think olympic athletes do this? Well, the Russians do. Yeah, for sure, and I'm not putting anything past the Chinese. I'm not gonna get in your way or anything, but if you want to drink and party, then I'm out, man. Right. I'm out. ( BELCHES ) Sorry, what? Good luck finding another partner. Darren, look. If i knew you were serious, i wouldn't be drinking. Come on. You're pouring another glass right now. Yeah, well, now it looks like you really are leaving, so I'm kind of hedging my bets here. You're an idiot. What? Fine. See you at Christmas, i guess. You're up early. You still bring her flowers, huh? Yeah, every Sunday. Yeah, i like that, uh, plastic holder thing you put in. Darren did that. It's kind of cheap looking, but it's nice of him. Tip my 40 in the memory of my mother. Jesus, Jimmy, what are you... What? Don't pour beer on your mother. It was... Okay. Sorry. It's an urban thing. Sorry. Oh, so Darren quit. ( CHUCKLES ) Want to tell me what happened? He, he... you know. We were just having fun. Jimmy, what happened? He was being a baby about me having a few drinks. Ah. And you want to know what i think? Maybe. I think if you quit drinking and really, really trained seriously, you'd still have a hard time making the open. Son, if you don't straighten up, you have a snowball's chance in hell. And after the whole dash Stevens ordeal... No. That was, like, 15 years ago. Jimmy, he's your brother. Did you ever stop and think what it must've been like for him? To watch you turn pro, do all the things he wanted to do? You want my advice? Be a better brother. All right, I'm gonna get out of here. This place fucking bores me. Love you, dad. Love you. Hey. How long have you been waiting out here? Uh... well, i didn't want to wake you, so... What do you want? You were right. Okay, i know this is, uh... I know this is my last shot to prove anything, and i want to do it right. Look, i think it's great that you're wearing a shit without any stains on it, but just 'cause you brush your hair... I also cleaned my apartment. What does that have to do with anything? It's like a... symbol or... I don't know, asshole. Just listen. If you come back, give this another shot, then you run the show. All right? You... You make the rules. You're the coach. Okay? Hey, if i don't take this seriously, if you think at any point I'm fucking around too much or whatever, you can just... You can bail and tell me to fuck off, and that's that. Just give me one more shot. Come on. No drinking? Right. No drinking. No partying, no smoking, no drugs of any kind, no junk food, none of that shit. I promise. I won't even smile. Yeah? All right. Yeah? Let's do it. All right. You remember the routine? Yep. You know what, actually? I feel... I feel healthier. Yeah. Yeah. You probably lost six pounds alone not eating the food that drops on your shirt anymore. ( LAUGHING ) You shut up, and you shut up. DARREN: Okay. BARRY: Ooh, um, can you actually drop me off back at the school? I want to work on my forehand. What? No, no, no. We're, uh... We'll practice tomorrow. Dude, it's not gonna do any good. You have an awful, awful forehand. Right? DARREN: No. You got a good forehand. Uh... Bye-bye. Bye, now, Barry. See you later. See you later. WOMAN: Maybe because you're being a bitch. Out of my way! Seriously? You told me Barry wasn't here. What the fuck? Are you lying to me now? ( WOMEN ARGUING ) Who are these guys that are dropping him off? What the hell are you thinking? Get back inside, for crying out loud. WOMAN: How come you didn't hug me? What, no hug? What'd you do? What'd you tell him? Get inside. Oh, you get inside. Hey. Wh... Oh. You didn't realize i was coming. Uh, no, but, um... Oh. ( LAUGHS ) Jimmy said you asked me to come. Oh, no. But, i mean, you know, i... It's great. Yeah? Yeah, totally. No, this is great. How's, um, hair guy? Gary? Gary. Gary. It's going really well, i think. Cool. How'd you guys meet? Um... Uh, this dating web site. I do the on-line thing too, so... Really? Oh, gosh. Well, it's too bad you didn't find me before Gary, 'cause that would've been interesting. That would've been. ( LAUGHS ) Jack: Hey, slugger. Hey, dad. Jimmy: R-really? What? Dad, really? You call Darren "slugger" too? I thought that was our thing. I don't remember ever actually calling you "slugger." You don't? If anyone's the slugger, it's me. Jimmy, you lied to get me here. Everyone knows you're boning the wrong guy. Jimmy... what? Do you think she's boning the right guy? You've met him. Be honest. Jim... Jim... I'm just... ( WHISPERING ) Sorry to make this uncomfortable for you. JACK: Shut up! Fine. What's going on at the clinic? It's good. Busy. Yeah, we were packed. What did we have? Eight dogs, seven cats and a ferret today. Actually, we had seven dogs and eight cats. Pretty sure it was eight dogs and seven cats, and i definitely remember the ferret, although as soon as i started saying that, i was thinking, "was the ferret yesterday?" Yeah, i think it was. I can't do... Guys, I'm gonna cut you off, because otherwise I'll kill myself. ( PAGER BEEPING ) Dad still thinks he's in new Jack city. Oh, it's an emergency. Kind of. It's Mrs. dolcort. Oh, her pomeranian, she's in really bad shape. Yeah, but, you know, we're all here. Why don't i take this? No, look. It's Mrs. dolcort. She'll throw a fit if it's not me in person. But if you go, how are we gonna solve the "seven dog, eight dog" mystery? Okay. It's gonna keep me up. Let's do this again soon, okay? It's great to see you two together. Bye, dad. Bye, Jack. See ya, pop. I call him "pop." It's a thing. So, are you guys gonna hit it tonight? Really? We're ready to order. He's a pretty big guy, so I'm assuming he's got some junk in the trunk. As in "elephant trunk." Do you know what I'm saying? My penis is feeding your mouth right now? Mm-hmm. Elephant trunk. ( IMITATES ELEPHANT SOUND ) You know what I'm saying? Elephant trunk. You're good at this. Yeah, thank you. HEATHER: I stopped you again. ( VIDEO GAME BEEPING ) I'm here with the Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, undeniably the greatest doubles team of all time. Gentlemen, of all the tournaments you've won, do any stand out in particular? MAN: Definitely winning the alerian open. You guys share not only the trophies but a lot of other parts of your life. Is it true that you once shared a bank account? MAN: We've shared everything. We lived together for forever. We went to high school, went to college together. We turned pro on the same date. We got our braces on and off on the same day. So, yeah, it's wild how close we are, but it's what makes our partnership so strong. In the film pacific rim, there are things called jaegers, giant robots, and they have to be piloted by a tandem team, one taking the left hand, one taking the right hand. I think you guys would make great jaeger pilots. What do you think? Would you ever consider doing that? I think we'd be a good two-headed monster. ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Come in. You text me "code red" and then don't pick up your phone. What's going on? I have to ask you something. Okay. What? How long have you been a substitute teacher? What? Off and on for seven years. Why? What's going on? Seven years? Wow. That's cool. And you're... what? You're, like, a democrat? I'm a registered independent. What the fuck is going on, Jimmy? What? You're my partner, and i don't even know, you know, what your favorite food is. You know? What's your favorite food? Oh, my god. This is your "code red" emergency? Okay. Let's put our cards on the table, dude. Okay? We're not close. Yeah. Okay. And we... We need to be in tune with each other, to know what each other's thinking on the court, if we want to have a chance in hell. I mean, do you know why the Bryan brothers are the number one team in the world? They fucking love each other. I mean, like, really a lot. They're in tune. They're in sync. We need to be in sync. The pre-quallies are right around the corner, and if we want to win there, we have to learn shit about each other. That is our plight. That's what we have to do. So suck it up, bitch. So, what kind of music are you into these days? You still like Pearl jam? Yeah, they're good. See? I knew you better than i thought. ¶ Unsealed on a porch ¶ ¶ a letter said ¶ ¶ it said, "i wanna leave it ag... ¶" hey, do you like coldplay? I feel like you like coldplay. No, not really. You ever shave your pubes? I do, once in a while. Psychologically, it makes me feel more aerodynamic. Plus it makes my dick look bigger. ( IMITATING EDDIE VEDDER ) ¶ shaving pubes ¶ ¶ makes a dick look bigger ¶ ooh, Barry! Barry! We need a plan for every serve and return. Right. We need that plan, but... If something comes up in the moment, we also need to go off that plan. Yeah, but we, at the very least, have to begin with a plan. Yes, as long as you're willing to make those last-minute detours. Yeah, as long as the detours bring you back to the plan. Italian. My favorite food is Italian. Boring. Actually, it's Southern Italian. Go! New movie's... Showing. So you're... Going. Could care... Less. About the five you're... Blowing. Theater gets... Dark. Just to start the... Show. You spot a... Fine woman. Sitting in your... Row. She's dressed in... Yellow. She says... Hello. Come sit... Next to me. You fine... Fellow. So you run over... There. Without a second to... Lose. Then what comes next? Just bust a move, fatty! Oh, yeah! ( LAUGHING ) Come on, Barry! Uh! Uh! Uh! ¶ You want it, you got it ¶ what the hell is that? JIMMY: Good session today, man. This "opening up" shit is like emotional steroids. Yeah. Hey, you remember when i played with that guy, dash Stevens? Yeah. What about him? Nothing. Just... He was the worst. That's good to know. I mean, you're way better than him. Thanks. Thanks, man. Barry, what's going on? You've been quiet lately. Yeah. Is there anything on your mind? Maybe. I was... Just this one day... I was being really annoying at home, and... You know how sometimes you do one thing, and that leads to another thing and that leads to another thing? Like a chain reaction? If i hadn't been so annoying that day, other bad things wouldn't have happened. That woman at your house when we dropped you off, that was your mom, huh? Yeah. I know i told you she died. Oh, that's okay. You've got to understand, Barry, whatever happened, whether your mom left or what, you know, it's not your fault. Okay? Is she still at the house? Yeah, sort of. Are you around this weekend? 'Cause the pre-quallies start tomorrow, and we could really use your support in our corner. Do you think you could help us out? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Okay, good. That's good. It's good that Barry's gonna help us out, right, Jimmy? Is this a trick question? Yeah, i don't give a fuck. Just tell him not to color-coordinate so much. Yeah, i don't think that's something he can control. ( RACQUET STRIKING BALL ) ( PEOPLE APPLAUDING ) ( MAN OVER P.A., INDISTINCT ) I've never seen you so nervous. I'm not nervous. Are you nervous? Not that nervous. I'm nervous. Okay. BARRY: So cool! You know anything about these guys? Uh, yes. The one with the moustache kind of looks like Freddie Mercury. I'm not sure if that helps us out, tennis-wise. I'm not worried. Suddenly I'm not worried. Fuck. Seriously? Come on. ( EXHALES ) Come on. ( EXCLAIMS ) Sorry, partner. Those tube socks threw me off. Can't believe i gave them that set. Two double faults in the last game. Yeah, the volley into my own foot didn't help either. ( EXHALES SHARPLY ) So how is Southern Italian food different than regular Italian food? Uh... Less butter, more olive oil, and not as many meats. Just more refined, you know? Right. It's pretty tasty. Yeah, it sounds... Sounds tasty. ¶ Feeling so lonely all the time ¶ ¶ I'm feeling so lonely every day ¶ ¶ hey ¶ ¶ what can i do to ¶ ¶ make you realize ¶ ¶ that i really want you here today, hey ¶ ¶ all i did was complain, hey, hey ¶ ( EXCLAIMING ) ¶ And worry about the things, baby ¶ ¶ you may find it funny that i ¶ hey! Yeah! Yeah! Let's do this, bitch! Yeah! Whoo! Slam it, slam it, slam it. Dude, why did you do that? You could've slammed that shit home! Fuck, i know. It's all good, baby. ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) If we win this point, we go to palm Springs for the quallies. ( SHOUTS ) Yes! Yes! What's up, palm Springs? How about that, man? Whoo! Great game. Well played. Weird shirts. Darren. Hey. Um, it's not really... Shut up. I mean, don't shut up. Just, uh, don't say anything. So, i just came off a really big win, and I'm feeling more confidence now than i pretty much ever have in my life, so, um... This is actually harder than i thought. Um, we just won the pre-qualifying tournament, and we're going to palm Springs. And if we win at palm Springs, we are actually in the open. So... so you should come with us... with me... And-and then after... ( DOOR OPENS ) Amateur tennis? Nice. Wow, that is so funny. We were just talking about what we were gonna do this weekend. Palm Springs? Awesome. Mm-hmm. I... have you been working out? I... I think it's great that you guys have a... It's lining up like that. Can you get us tickets? Uh, probably not, but the tickets are... The tickets, they're eight or nine. Well, then... yeah. That's... yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You guys will... Nice. All right. Um... Perfect. Well, have a good night, and, uh... Good to see you, Darren. Yeah. Okay. Real fucking nice, you fucking idiot. What up, what up? Dude! Guys, quick question. What are the odds of me being a ball boy? I mean, i heard that the officials and the ball boys in the quallies were volunteers. BARRY: I think we need to have a talk about mutual respect. You play world of warcraft? Yeah. You? Uh, yeah. My main 'toon is a level 90 on dead mage with a complete regalia of the burns scroll set. 214, buddy. Two pieces away from completing my p.V.P. Set. You? I'm level 82, human paladin, but all the level 90... Yeah, yeah, okay. You know what? Don't talk to me about wow again until you're at least a level 90 with respectable raiding gear. And by respectable, i mean epic. Okay. You know what? One other thing. We're a fucking team now, okay? And we're men. And men... Men don't blame themselves for pussy-ass shit that's not their fault. Your mom doesn't have her shit together, that's her issue. No more blaming yourself for that, or I'm gonna throw you out of this fucking car. You got it? Got it. Good. So, um, about me being a ball boy... Shh. Go to sleep. No, no, no. Over there. JIMMY: What's up, palm Springs? Yo, what's up, dude? How you feeling? You strong? You strong? That guy's such a pussy, dude? Such a puss. With the open a week away, unseeded players are here in palm Springs competing in the qualifying tournament for the open's final spots. Jimmy price found a partner. Unbelievable. Good luck, buddy. Bam. Bam. Bam. Young rookies and old vets will battle it out for the prize of being slaughtered in the first round by a top-seeded opponent. What do you know about these guys? Okay, here we go. Alan freedland... He's got a great forehand. Stay away from that. Alan Cohen, he's the guy closer to us... He is a scrapper. He'll poach all day long. Keep him honest. Hit a few down the line. People call them the Alans. I call them the Alan-gators. Rumor has it they tried to fuck the same girl once in a pool in Florida. That's good to know. I wonder if their dicks touched. Why don't we ask them? Let's do this. This is Barry. Hi, Barry. This is Gary. Hey, man. Our names rhyme. That's mildly amusing. All right, all right. What's up, ladies? Call it. Tails. Suck it. We're gonna serve. Boom! Oh, guys, guys, sorry. Um, is it true you actually touched dicks in fl... I wasn't finished. Come on. Let's go. Yeah! Match point, man. We get this, and we're moving on. ( CHEERING ) That's my brother right there! Whoo! ( LAUGHS ) No, no, no, no, Barry, Barry. This is a buffet, which means you only eat the expensive shit. Take whatever you want, Barry. That's the whole point of a buffet. You want some leafy Greens, you get your leafy Greens. Really? Okay, fine. You don't get your money's worth, it's not my fault. This is exactly why you two are broke. Move on. Hey, nice match out there, guys. Oh, nice fake compliment to cut the line. Thanks. Hey, sorry about your draw. "Sorry"? Oh, you didn't hear? You guys drew Osborne and chandy for your second match. Aren't they top-ten? What are they doing in the quallies? Osborne injured his ankle and missed most of the year, so the quallies are their warm-up for the open. They endured the test of time and... Hey, hey, hey. You're not on camera, asshole. We can totally take those tools, trust me. I'm just gonna head to the meats. I'm not gonna fill up on bread and tomatoes like a fucking chump. Jesus. So you're like the tennis announcer guy. Uh, yeah. Did you ever play tennis? I played in high school. Oh, so not really. Watch your tone, nerd. Osborne's had time to rehab his ankle, but it's still untested. Although you may want to worry less about strategy and more about that. Who is that? Alexander. His partner went down a few days ago. He's already in the open, so he's looking for a last-minute replacement. But... I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) Out! Come on, guys. ANNOUNCER: Game and first set, Osborne-chandy. Come on, bro. We can bounce back from this. Let's go. Man! Sorry. My bad. Really? ANNOUNCER: Game, Osborne-chandy. Ace! ( CROWD APPLAUDING ) Tough serves, huh? They're too good. No. The boys just need to keep their heads in it. They'll be okay. Hey! Me! Get out of the way. Game, price-price. ( GROANING ) What if he can't continue? Well, they'd have to forfeit, and we advance. BARRY: Awesome! Hey, Barry, you don't want to ever root for an injury, okay? At least, not openly. Can you go on? No, i don't think so. Osborne-chandy forfeit due to Osborne injury. Price-price advance. Yes! Sorry. Sorry, guys. It's bad luck, guys. It's bad luck. Dude. Darren. Darren, hey. What the fuck, man? Fuck you, man. Why are you being such a dick? What? I did you a pretty big fucking favor by making a run with you, and then... It's a pretty fucking dick move to try to throw the match. Seriously? You think i... Dude, those guys are a top-ten team, man. Yeah, i messed up a few times, but... "A few times"? Dude, that was the worst match you have ever played. At least if you're going to throw a match, try to do it with a little art. You want to play the blame game and re-count points? 'Cause i can easily go into all the forehands you fucked up. Here you go. Here you go. Let's forfeit the next match, and you can just go play with Alexander like you always wanted to. Dude, stop being an asshole, please. We're about to go to the open. We're one match away. Fuck you, man! You're being a fucking dick. Don't fucking touch me, man. What the fuck? You're being an ass... Let me tell you something. Mom died, and you left me. You don't fucking do that! You're a shitty brother, Jimmy. You've always been a shitty fucking brother! You fuck! What the fuck? Ow. Fuck. So... Trouble with Jimmy? Not really. Kind of. You know, when i was just like a week or two out of vet school, i got a call to go to this farm and work on a donkey. I'd never worked on a donkey before. What kind of donkey? I don't remember, Barry. If i said the name of the breed, would you remember? Barry, it's not... Was it mammoth Jack, abyssinian... I'm trying to tell a story here. Sorry. Listen, dad, i really appreciate the effort, but i think i just want to be alone right now. Just so you know, the donkey was Jimmy in that story. Barry, come on. Let's go, man. Oh, uh, Alexander? He found a new partner this morning. Jimmy told him no before your match against Osborne and chandy. Win or lose, your brother's in this thing with you. JIMMY: I'm not saying it wasn't a shitty thing to do. I mean, i got this offer to play with this top pro, and i took it. VANESSA78: That was a pretty shitty move. But you were in a shitty place. Yeah, but... It's okay, babe. Don't worry about it. You were a shitty-ass brother, and now you've got a ton of years to be a not-shitty-ass brother. You got it all figured out, huh? Medium. Mm, I've got a client that wants to chat. Let's get rid of him. No, it's okay. You work. I'm going to, uh... I'm gonna head down to the hot tub, loosen up a bit before bed. Okay. Okay? Good night. Good luck tomorrow. Yeah. ( CHUCKLES ) Come in if you want, but I've pissed in here twice already. What happened to your face? I got into a fight. No, not the bruises. Just... Just your face. In general. I thought that was a funny... don't interrupt me, Barry. I'm staring at you in disgust. Okay, now, what do you want? I wanted to know if you asked the officials if i could be a ball boy for tomorrow's match or not. No, no, i did not ask the officials if you could be a ball boy, okay? Now, get the fuck out of here. Okay. Barry, what the fuck? Where are you going? You just told me to get out of here. Okay, look. Part of being a man means not doing everything i say and standing up for yourself. Got it? Got it. Good. Now, get the fuck out of here. Seriously. You know, i think I'm just gonna stay and hang out. No, no. Look. I know what i just said, but I've got a big match tomorrow, and i need to focus. So i need you to leave. I'm serious, you little prick. Would you listen to me? Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you, Jimmy. I'm staying. All right. Atta boy. Yeah. So i think when i get back, i might want to join a tennis league. I might need some help. ( LAUGHS ) Look, if you're asking me to be your coach, just forget it, man. No fucking way, seriously. I was actually thinking about Darren. Dar... Darren? What the fuck, Barry? I'm way better than Darren. Come on, man. But Darren's been actually... Fine. I will fucking coach you. Just shut up about it already. Okay. Now, get out of here. For real. ( MOANS ) MAN: Nothing i can do, Jimmy. JIMMY: You don't have to be a dick, dude. Sorry. My hands are tied. Well, so are mine, because i really didn't want to have to do this, Ron. Do what? Well, do you remember the controversial call you made in the sevingnon match? Well, guess who has proof that you were boning her all the way to the finals. Emir. ( SNAPS FINGERS ) You're out. What? ( CROWD CHEERING ) MAN: Game, McNamara. Love-30. My eye is fine, by the way. You've always been a quick healer. Right. Look, Jimmy... Yeah? Can we just beat these fuckers and get in the open already? All right. So Davenport is tough. Let's finish points fast. I don't want to get into rallies with these kids. And I'm gonna be all over the net, more than usual, so be tight on the switch. I'm gonna be aggressive with my serves, but i swear I'll be smart. Just make sure i know where you're going. Yeah, of course. I've always said we needed a plan. We need a plan, but we should also be able to stray from that plan. ( CHUCKLING ) Why are you cutting holes in your pockets? ¶ I want to be a gangster ¶ ¶ i can't take it anymore ¶ ¶ I've got anger like a gangster ¶ let's do this, bitches. ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the alerian open final qualifying round.

Welcome, welcome. HEATHER: Hey, Jack. Hey, man, she's still showing up. You've got to be doing something right. Price-price won the toss and have elected to serve.

That's what I'm talking about. I kind of wanted to give them that set. Yeah, i did feel bad for them. Right? It's out of my system now. Me, too. Fuck. Come on. ( EXCLAIMS, CHUCKLES ) ¶ I can't see ¶ yes! ¶ If i could, you know i would ¶ ¶ i can't see ¶ ( APPLAUSE ) ¶ My baby ¶ ¶ if i could, you know i would ¶ nice! ¶ I'm so high up on a cloud ¶ ¶ that i finally got my chance to start looking down ¶ MAN: Game and set, price-price.

I need to talk to you. HEATHER: What? The other night, i came over 'cause i wanted to burst inside and carry you up the stairs and spend three nights in bed with you. What the f... But i wussed out. Gary's got a really great head of hair, and he says "nice" a lot... Okay, that's it, Heather. We're leaving. You're not nice, you're... You're fucking amazing. Let's go. Heather. Now. Nice. JIMMY: Bye. Team price, please take the court. Could you just... Really, Ron? All right. I'm gonna go win this match and get in the open, and after, I'm taking you to dinner. Price-price, this is a warning. Please... Ron... Down with that? Yeah. I'm down with that. Good luck. Okay. So you want to fuck shit up right now and roll into the open? ( CHUCKLING ) Hell, yeah. Out! ( APPLAUSE ) Yes! Look at the big balls on you. Boys. What a match. Great job. Uh-huh. Great match, Jimmy. You too, kid. Can i give you one last piece of advice? Yeah, sure. Yeah? All right. Remember, tennis doesn't come from here. You're gonna be tempted to think it's here or here... Or even here. But it doesn't. It comes from here. All right? Ronnie, good work out there, buddy. Thank you. Aw, it's okay. I'm so proud of you guys. Yeah, yeah! So will you still go to dinner with me? Yes, i will. Thank you. That was beautiful. Thank you. I'm proud of you. How do you feel, Barry? How do you feel? I feel good about it. You do? And what about that ball you flubbed in the fourth game of the second set? You feel good about that? You saw that? Everybody saw that, Barry. I stick my neck out for you, and you hang me out to dry. That thing probably already has a million hits on YouTube. Good. Good. Take your time. Hustle. Hustle! Take your time! Yes. Good, good. Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle. Stay in the game. Stay in the game. Good, good, good! Hey, sweetheart. Darren, you know Vanessa. Introduce her. Hi, Darren! Oh, hey, Vanessa. This is Heather. Hi! My dad, Jack. It's okay, Barry. Shake it off, buddy. Darren, please do not coach my player. Don't shake it off, Barry. Do not shake it off. Let it dwell. DARREN: You're an idiot. Hey, my technique. Do not fuck with it. Guys, guys, guys, come on, Barry's got game point here. Right. Here we go, buddy. ( CHEERING ) Yeah! That was in! Yeah!
