"I wanted to be like my dad." Or I a. Oo lo na oo ll a a I lo I lo: Oo ll oo I: Lo. La oy lo fi. A I lon "I wanted to be like my dad." You've gotten so big, rin. I'm sure you'll grow up to be strong. Da-dy! All right, now it's your turn, goul! Up you go! Okay, here I go! Ready, set... Wow! Big biceps! Read this book! And then, they finally reached the island of the demons... Demons came out! That's right, there are a lot, huh? Wait, I'll count. One... two... three... four... Wow, you're amazing! "I loved my dad." A ci I I a:. . Yo in oo I oo I - oo. Ll io . - A . On gou and I both loved our old man. Panties! These are swimsuits. When daddy was little, he competed in a lot of swim meets and won! Welcome home! Thanks. You won! Huh? We heard that you won a lot in swimming! Mommy said you were really strong! I want to swim, too! Okay. Oh, you guys are good! That's the way to do it. Aw, I want one, too! You can have one next time. I thought that I wanted to be like my old man one day. I thought that those days would continue forever... I wanted them to continue forever... Well, we're not going that far out today... I'll be back... Be careful. Oh, sorry, did I wake you? Mommy, the clock... Oh my, it stopped. I wonder if it's broken? We'll be right back after I bring her the change of clothes. It's fine. Tell grandma I hope she feels better soon. Okay, I will. Mom...? Hello? Oh, matsuoka? Please listen calmly to what I'm about to say. The boat that left the fishing harbor early this morning with llwamura-San and the others was shipwrecked in this sudden change of weather. We can't contact city hall, and with these waves, we can't send rescue... "My world changed in an instant." We can't contact city hall, and with these waves, we can't send rescue... "My world changed in an instant." My world changed suddenly. "My heart..." "Was broken." "I was sad. I hated it. My heart was a mess. I cried easily. I couldn't accept reality. My tears wouldn't stop." "I was sad. I hated it. My heart was a mess. I cried easily. I couldn't accept reality. My tears wouldn't stop." I was just so, so sad. "I was sad. I hated it. My heart was a mess. I cried easily. I couldn't accept reality. My tears wouldn't stop." My heart hurt. N but... n "but..." se=r=sstew but... "I wanted to support them." "I wanted to support them." I wanted to support them. "I had to become stronger." Nmr mem mene mem mem = fm me a es eae eee I thought that I had to be strong... "Just like my dad," "had to be number one." You were really fast just now. Let's have a race. Okay, sure. "At that tournament," at that tournament, "haru was there." Cl ee regen eee oe ser mr me em ee me oe see ee a ee ee = ee AAA rae that guy was there. "Nanase haruka" "matsuoka rin" "Entrance ceremony" Ouch! Why are you stopping all of a sudden, haru? The light... Jeez, it's because you're not looking in front of you, asahi. It can't be helped, can it? My vontage is really high right now 'cause of the meet today. Don't you mean "voltage"? Stupid asahi. What?! Shut up, you little... Hey, wait... Stop it, you two... Come on. If you don't hurry up, you'll be late for the practice meet. Jeez, you guys just did your team best a little while ago. What're you doing? You're perfectly in sync when it comes to relay exchanges, though. It's not by choice. What did you say?! I said, stop it... you'll get hurt! "Club resignation letter" "Samezuka academy" You don't look scary anymore. Huh? Wait a minute! Why me? That's what I decided. But I shouldn't be captai... Stop complaining. Who said they would take responsibility? That was... I want to leave the club in your hands. Matsuoka. Yes, sir. You're captain starting tomorrow. I'm leaving this club to you. Yes, sir. Rin-chan's captain? Rin-San doesn't seem like the captain type... What are you talking about?! No matter how you look at it, his muscles are captain level! His muscles? "Matsuoka family grave" I'm going to move forward on the path I believe in. "And then..." So... === se "a new year begins." I feel... the clear water dive, this moment I was looking for our "free" that we will make here "free! -Timeless medley-the promise" our "free" that we will make here "free! -Timeless medley-the promise" breath, as I struggle dream, I'll never give it up so, I like this place after all stay free, and before I knew it it became irreplaceable with our bonds of understanding each other Exposing the me that was about to lose even then, I could believe swimming in the "today" that I want to surpass toward the dyed "blue" without looking back so that my hesitation won't catch up to me I'll speed up, won't hesitate any more at the end of the line connecting me to my friends I'll keep drawing a "rising free" of hope Hm... All right. Oh, are you looking to join? Sorry, we're not opening till next month. You can fill out the application form first. No, I'm... In order to join our club, you have to be faster than the samezuka standard time. We'll time you now, so swim your own specialties for us. Yes, sir! Captain. What's wrong? Ai, will you stop calling me that? Huh? Just call me what you usually do. R-right. Anyway, we have a lot of people who want to join this year. Oh yeah, captain mikoshiba said there'd be an amazing new swimmer, didn't he? Could he be here right now? If you're not careful, you might lose your place to the first years. R-right! Hey, rin-chan! Oh, what's up, nagisa? Are you free after practice today? I don't really have anything planned... What's up? Then, do you want to do something fun with us? What the heck...? Wait, nagisa-kun, invite him properly! What? But rin-chan'll be happier this way, too! Nagisa, let me talk to him. Rin? Hey, haru. Come to iwatobi high school later. What, you want to race again? You'll know when you come. Jeez, all right. I'll go right after I finish checking the practice regimen. Hey, haru. I'm here! Come out! Jeez... He's the one who told me to come. Where is he? Huh? It's open. Take him away! Ki-ki! Hey, wait, let go! Don't struggle. Hey! Hey! You...! Haru-chan, you forgot your sentence ending! Hey! Hey! You...! Don't struggle, moge. Hey, wait! What do you mean, "moge"?! C'mon, let go! Huh?! Oh no, don't take my big brother away! C'mon, let go! Huh?! What, you're here too, gou?! Rin, don't kick! You guys, stop messing arou... Oh. When we were in elementary school, didn't you say you wanted to swim in a cherry blossom pool? We originally opened the pool to try to get some new members. Ama-chan worked really hard to get permission. But in the end, no one came. But thanks to that, we were able to see a cherry blossom pool, so we wanted to show you, too. You guys... Rin-San, go ahead. Huh? Go ahead. I guess we have to let you swim. I want to, but it's still too cold to swim. Come on, big brother! Take it off! You don't have to hold back! Hey! Yeah, you don't have to be embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed! Wait, stop...! It's cold! It doesn't look like it'll stop any time soon. We set everything up, but now we can't swim. Could you be a "rainman," rei-kun? No, I'm not! The weather forecast didn't say anything about rain. That reminds me... Have you guys thought about what you'll do after graduation? Rin, you're aiming for the world, right? Yeah, I've already wasted a lot of time. This summer's nationals are my last chance. Scouts will be at the nationals. If I do well there, I can get closer to my dream. On TV last night there was... Thanks for this, matsuoka. Sure. Take your seats. Let me introduce a transfer student. Yamazaki sosuke, who transferred here from Tokyo. Please welcome him to our class, everyone. Sosuke! Long time no see, sosuke! Yeah, it's been five years. This is a weird time to be transferring schools. You shouldn't be talking. Winter of sixth grade, you were the one who transferred in the middle of the year. Guess what? I've decided to go to iwatobi elementary. I've found people who want to swim a relay with me. Oh yeah, that happened. So? Why are you here at samezuka? I thought you were going to a high school in Tokyo with a strong swim team. Well, a lot happened. What is it? Spit it out. It's not like you. I just thought I'd swim at home for my last high school season. 'Cause I know what I'm doing after graduation. Hey, wait! Don't tell me you're gonna quit swimming? I got scouted. What? You little... That's great! Hey! Stop that, rin! Everyone, quiet down! My name is yamazaki sosuke. I'm from tokitsu high school in Tokyo. Yamazaki is ranked nationally in the top ten for butterfly. He can teach you a lot. Oh, wow! Yes, sir. I'm your advisor, sugimoto. Matsuoka, show him the ropes around here. Sure, looking forward to swimming with you again, sosuke. Yeah, same here. So this is what a nationally ranked perfect body looks like! N-nice to meet youl! I'm nitori aiichiro, second year. I look forward to swimming with youl! Nice to meet you. Oh, tokitsu high school is super famous for its swim team, isn't it? Wow, as expected of rin-senpai's friend! Does this mean you know nanase-San and the others, too? I know this guy from sano elementary. He has nothing to do with haru. I know of nanase, though. I've competed against him before. He gave me the shivers when I swam with him. As expected of someone you're obsessed with. Wh-wh...? Jeez. He's fast! It's because his torso rises above the water more than normal swimmers, so he has less water resistance and can recover faster. And the flexibility of his shoulders isn't something that happens overnight. That sosuke is really something. Oh, so the amazing swimmer captain mikoshiba was talking about was him? Yeah, when I see him, it brings back memories... It's so hot! I'm parched... Which one do you want? Ready, set... this one! Rock, paper, scissors! One more time... This is delicious! Man, I definitely would've beaten you in butterfly! Oh, you wanna compete with butterfly stroke next time? Then next time, let's say... The loser has to do one thing the winner tells him to. How's that? Sounds fun. Okay! All right, it's a promise, then! Then let's race to the pool! Huh? Hey, wait! No fairl wait up, rin! Rin, I said wait up! "Iwatobi so returns grand opening event" "iwatobi so returns grand opening event" "sprashu fes"? "Iwatobi so returns grand opening event" it's spelled wrong. What will happen at the event? I'm planning a bunch of fun things. You guys help, too! "Strawberry milk" "strawberry milk" all right, let's come up with the main event! All right, let's come up with the main event! Like a doggie paddle race! That sounds fun! How about a competition to see who has the best butterfly form? We can call it "butterfly of beauty." A muscle contest would be nice, too! Will you stop talking about muscles?! What about you, haru? Any ideas? What about a relay? What?! Are you serious, haru? People would love that! Let's do it, haruka-senpail it's a popular race at tournaments, too! Then we'd need someone to swim against, too. Splash fes? C'mon, please! Jeez, those guys are always so carefree. Even though you're complaining, you're gonna do it, right? But who else will? It's not an official match, so it's hard to ask people to swim. I'll do it. Y-you will? Yeah, but... I want to swim freestyle. That's fine, but isn't your specialty butterfly? I feel like swimming freestyle this time. They're late. B-bad news! What's wrong? N-nakagawa-kun got in trouble with the teacher and can't come anymore! Huh? What did he do? So it's just us three, then? What are we going to do? We can't do a medley relay like this. Isn't there anyone else who can swim backstroke? I'll swim twice. It's just a race at an event, right? There's no reason to follow official competition rules. I know it's not an official race, but I want to have a real race. Hey, mikoshiba! Mikoshiba? I'm c o m in g I hurry up! Sorry, sorry. There's only one mikoshiba that I know of. What a coincidence. Me too. Wait a sec! Whoa! What are you doing? Are you by any chance mikoshiba seijuro's brother? What? You know my brother? Bingo! Captain mikoshiba's... Dittle brother! Then you should be able to swim backstroke, right? Of course! Actually, it's what I usually swim. In fact, I've won lots of races swimming backstroke. There wasn't a person back home who didn't know of me, either. By the way, my nickname is... "Otter... Of the sea of Japan." Otter... So the amazing swimmer captain mikoshiba was talking about was him? Yeah, he wasn't talking about sosuke. He was talking about this guy. Mikoshiba! I'm c o m in g I later! Time to pick up some girls... S-stop bugging me! Swimmers aren't popular with the girls, so I'm not joining the swim team. I'm not asking you to join the swim team. I know a place you'll like. You want to be popular with the girls, right? Yeah... Let go! Liar! I thought we were going somewhere with lots of cuties! Shut up, there are a lot of cuties here. See? Cute... Kids. I was tricked! Big bro! Stop struggling! I'm going home! I'm going... Man, you're so late... Big brother! Hey, go... Morning! Morning. Wait a sec. You're... So kyute! There's no mistake. They're definitely brothers. Rin, everyone, thanks for coming. Sure. No problem, I was looking forward to it, too. Really? I'm glad. Here are programs for you, too. Oh, thank you. Oh, sosuke-kun! Hey, how have you been, gou? Good. It's been a long time! I haven't heard from you at all since you went to a different high school. You're just like my brother. Sorry, sorry. Man... Who is he? Rin's friend from his old school, sano elementary. He swam in the Lane next to us during that relay we swam as kids. Is that so? Well, see you later. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. I'm mikoshiba momotaro. My hobby is looking for stag beetles. My favorite saying is "even kappa can have trouble swimming." I'm good at making fried eggs. The first place I wash is... Hurry up and walk. Owww! What do you want, yamazaki? Long time no see, nanase. I saw the relay at the regionals. You were here? I just happened to be. But what you guys did was really outrageous. You even got rin involved. What are you trying to say? I wouldn't have made him do such a thing. What do you mean? Don't get in rin's way anymore. And now, we will have today's main event, the 200 m medley relay with team dolphin versus team shark! You can do it, big brother! The 200 m medley relay with team dolphin versus team shark! Gou-San! I heard that he's captain mikoshiba's little brother, and his specialty is the backstroke. Really? Also, it sounds like rin-chan is swimming butterfly today. W-wait, really? So yamazaki-kun will be swimming freestyle. On your Mark... Get set... Go! Man, look at that guy! I didn't know he had such an elegant backstroke start. He's a pretty good swimmer! But as expected, makoto-senpai is faster. He's quickly pulling ahead. Ai-chan, you're swimming breaststroke today? I won't lose. I-I won't either. This is the result of our training. Yeah. There's no way we can lose! Nagisa's usually stronger in the second half. We can widen our lead then. It seems we have the advantage. I guess I'll just have to let you go first. But you'd better watch your back. Be careful not to get bitten. Wh...?! Catch me if you can. It's rei-chan versus rin-chan! Rin's catching up to rei little by little. He's fast! Rin-senpai will catch up soon. He made up that difference in no time. What is he? He's matsuoka rin, captain of the samezuka swim club. Who'll be first?! It's rei! The difference between them is smaller than before. He's keeping up with haru's speed. Looking good, sosuke! Go! Sosuke. Good work. That was some nice swimming. Thanks for coming today. Sure. I'm ss o rry! It's because I was slow... Don't worry about it. It was pretty good for a team that hasn't swum together before. I'm not going to lose next time! Hey. Ow... By "next time," do you mean you're going to swim again? If you want to, come join the swim club. We'd be glad to have you. Let's grab something to eat on the way home. Sounds good! Are you paying? You little... Oh, fine. What, really? Yeah. Yamazaki-senpai's butterfly really is amazing. Yeah... But sosuke's still not going all out. Captain, it's crazy! That momo's super fast when he tries his best! He's breaking the club record! He's amazing! Maybe this guy is... What're you doing?! Hey, you all right? Ouch! You didn't see the five-meter line? Well, it's just the beginning. Ow... gah, I'm still not used to this pool! Dude, you're amazing! Can you go again? Easy! I can handle it. Good, that's the spirit! Don't hit the wall again. 1 have to work hard, too! All right, I'm gonna time you again! I definitely want to swim in the relay. He won't be able to swim in the relay with his times. He doesn't have a chance. Yeah, not at this rate. But it's up to him how fast he can improve on his own. No amount of talent can beat hard work. Cola, as usual? You never change, do you? It's been a while. Maybe I'll have one, too. "Sold out" it's been a while. Maybe I'll have one, too. "Sold out" oh. Wanna fight me for it? You're on. Rock, paper... I haven't had one in a while, but it's pretty good. That reminds me, I lost back then, too. Huh? Do you remember that promise? "Cola guy" "miss" the loser has to do one thing the winner tells him to. No hard feelings, 'Kay? I know, I know! We'll start when that second hand gets to the top, all right? Let's go... Dang it, if only I hadn't missed that turn! I win. All right, fine. I promised. I'll do whatever you say. What'd you want? C'mon, don't cry. I'm not crying! Hurry up and tell me what you want! Let's see... Well, I'll think about it. Now that you mention it, I made a promise, didn't 1? But in the end, you left for Australia without doing anything. What do you want to do about that promise? I forgot. I haven't thought about it yet... Hey, c'mon. It can be something to look forward to the next time we see each other. See you later. Yeah. Promise, huh? We were able to meet again like this. I'll do whatever you want to celebrate. Well then... Let me sleep on the bottom bunk. We already competed for that the other day. Besides, you're going to use a promise that lasted five years for that? Then give me half of the cola. Are you even bothering to think about this seriously? Well, give me a little more time to think. More importantly, rin, why didn't you call or text these past five years? Did something happen in Australia? The letters stopped coming, too. I thought you must've hit some sort of wall, so I didn't dare say anything. But... «eo. Now... [I want to know. It wasn't a big deal. It was what you thought it was. I went abroad and hit a wall, fell down and couldn't get back up. That's all it was. I even thought about quitting swimming completely. But I was saved... By haru and the others. By my friends. "Friends" again, huh? Yeah. When I swam with them, they showed me a view I had never seen before. “L want to swim again.” They made me think that. That's why this time, it's for those friends who helped me... And for my own dream. I remember now. You're a swimming-obsessed idealist. Oh, shut up. What do you mean, "it's better if we're not on the same team"? It's because we know each other too well. Sosuke cares more about theory than I do, so we fought a lot. In the end, we always ended up saying whoever was fastest was right, but man, we were super competitive. Do you hate him? Of course not. In fact, even now, I think he's the one who gets me the most. But it's better if we're not on the same team for a relay. Hey, what's wrong?! You need more extension! More extension! Was his time before just a fluke? It's the worst time in the club. That's not how it was s'posed to be! He's got something good there, but... Even if you have something good, there's no point if you don't use it. Going running? Huh? Yeah... Can I join you? Sure... You didn't have to come with me, you know. I have to run sometimes, too. Otherwise my body will get soft. I guess that's all right, then. Huh? That guy's... That ai might actually end up swimming in the relay, you know. Hey, rin. Your dream, or the relay... Which is more important to you? Huh? They're both important, of course. If you dream of competing at the world level, you don't have time to be worrying about friends or the relay. You should use your time for yourself. Practice like every minute, every second counts. If you keep worrying about the relay, your dream will disappear. You don't have time to play nice with everyone. That's not true. In the past, and now, I've been helped and supported by friends to get to this point. I'm here because of my friends. Of course, my dream is important. But... Swimming with my friends is the source of my strength. So even if it makes me seem naive, I'm going to go after both... My dream and the relay with my friends. I'm going to swim with the best team and make them both a reality. Then... Count me as your friend, too. What? By "friend," you mean... I want to swim relay, too. Sosuke. But I thought you didn't swim relays... You little...! What did you just say?! Hey, stop that. Don't talk bad about my dad anymore. I didn't mean it that way. Sorry. What was up with your swimming today? Say something. I think swimming is an individual sport after all. Once you get in the water, you're alone. It's not like you can swim faster by thinking about your friends. That's not true! Relay is a team sport! Why can't you understand that?! We just have different ways of thinking. You and I shouldn't be on the same team. I'm going to swim for myself. I just want to swim for myself and be responsible only for myself. It's true. Back then, that was all I could think. But... I'm different now. I feel like I might figure something out if I swim relay with you. I don't know why myself, though. But I want to find that something. Is that not enough?! Didn't you promise to do whatever I said? Rin. Even if I promised, it's no good. It's not something that's up to me. It'll be decided by your time. That's true. But... I accept that passion of yours. I hold the records for freestyle and butterfly at samezuka. If you really want to be in the relay, then win your place with your skill. In other words, if I beat you, I can swim butterfly in the medley? Then let's fight like we did back then. Sounds good to me. I'll take you on! The event is butterfly. The distance is 100 m. Let's go! This power... This confident swimming... This is how it should be, sosuke! All right! You finally showed me your all, huh? It's not just your passion, your skill is the real thing, too. Thanks to you, I've made up my mind. Thanks, sosuke. Listen up, everyone. It's almost time to enter the prefectural tournament. Regarding that, I'd like to change how we decide who enters the relay. In the past, those who had the fastest times would be chosen. However, this year, even if their times are the fastest, those who want to focus on their individual events don't have to swim in the relay. We'll choose members only from those who really want to be in the relay. Of course, it should be obvious that both desire and time are important. As your captain, what I'm saying might be wrong. I know that choosing based on time like we always have is better. But I want you guys to know how I feel about relays. I want to swim a serious relay with my friends swimming all out. Even if we win, there's no point if we can't do that. That's why I want you guys to respond to these feelings of mine. Now, step forward if you want to swim a relay with your all. That's the first step! I'm glad it looks like I should be better by the tournament... Sosuke-kun...? Whoal! Hey, be careful. Thanks. Old man, are you watching? But even that unathletic gou is involved in the world of competitive swimming now... "Matsuoka family grave" but even that unathletic gou is involved in the world of competitive swimming now... "Matsuoka family grave" it's all because of the opportunities you created for us. Hey, old man, I'll definitely do well at this year's tournament. So, please watch over me. Okay dad, we'll be back. Oh wait, go... Hm? I'll give this to you. Isn't this dad's...? It might make the old man happy if you put it up at iwatobi so again. Okay! Let's both work hard today! What are you gonna work hard at? Let's go. Hey, wait up! Big brother! Ready... Go! That's a good start. Ready... fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! That nitori is giving a pretty good show. Yeah, he's catching up to the lead! "Nitori aiichiro" "hazuki nagisa" "nagasaku yoichi" "ohara katsuhiro" "ono masakazu" "taniguchi nobuhiro" "kawano naoto" "hazuki nagisa" nitori didn't make it past the prelims, huh? That's the level he's at. Nitori's gotten better. Was it thanks to your teaching? No, I didn't do anything. He worked hard on his own. Oh? I see. Oh, good work! Thanks. Um, next is rin-senpai... Ready... Go! Ready... fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! You can do it, rin! So fast...! It's like they're from a different dimension! "Nanase haruka" "matsuoka rin" "yamauchi ryota" the difference between them was... Just 0.02 seconds. W-wow... What a race... Yeah... Don't lose like that, rin. Easy for you to say. That haru's time improves every time he races against me. He's so good, it's annoying. Forget that, sosuke. Tomorrow's finally the day of the relay, isn't it? Yeah. Sosuke, there are more races tomorrow. We need to get back and rest. Yeah, sorry. What were you looking at? A vision of the past. Huh? Just kidding. Perfect. "Path of the iwatobi swimming club" perfect. "Path of the iwatobi swimming club" "1st swimmer" "2nd swimmer" "stroke" "swimmer name: I iwashi" what's wrong? Everyone's waiting. Yeah. Can't decide? Looking at today's individual race, it's pretty clear you should choose mikoshiba over uozumi. I know. Uozumi. Yes, sir. Momo. Yes, sir! Both of you have strong feelings for the relay. You're on the same level in that respect. But looking at the results from today's individual race, there's only one choice we can make as a team. Momo, will you try swimming in the medley relay? Huh? Momo. Uh, yes? I won't forgive you if you lose. I'm counting on you to win in my place. Yes, sir. Leave it to me, uocchi-senpail who're you calling "uocchi," you little... Ow, ow, ow... that hurts! You're too cocky! Tomorrow's relay will be momo, iwashimizu, sosuke, and me. We'll race with this team. Yes, sir! Yes. That's it for today's meeting. You should all get some rest to prepare for tomorrow. That's all! Yes, sir! You're in the way. Oh, s-sorry! Hm? My junior has surpassed me... Do you want to be in the relay that badly? It's only natural. What is? I mean, I look up to rin-senpai. When I first started swimming, I thought a relay was just something that four people swam together. But I've realized that it's something completely different. This past year, seeing rin-senpai's feelings toward the relay up close, I wanted to swim relay with him, too. Besides, this summer is my last chance to swim with him. Who decided that this summer would be the end? Huh? If you really wanted to swim with him that badly, you'd be able to do it somewhere. Don't limit your own possibilities like that. That's probably what rin would say. Yes. All right. Oh, he's sleeping already? Momo-kun, it's too early. Let's see... Momotaro, you have to win and make it to the regional tournament! Because I'm going to swim next time, too! We haven't swum together in a relay at a tournament since that time, huh? Yeah. Let's win today. Yeah. If we're gonna do it, we have to win. Nitori-senpail what's wrong? Did you forget something? Um, I'm going to try really hard today! See yal! Huh? We will now begin the men's 400 m medley relay. But I was saved... By haru and the others. By my friends. Even so, I will not accept you. No hard feelings no matter who wins. Just make sure you make it to the regionals. I don't need you to tell me that. I let you have the freestyle race yesterday, but today'll be different. Ready... We did it, sosuke. Yeah. I heard that you got offers from scouts, rin-senpail congratulations! Thanks. Watching that race, it was only expected! It was amazing! If I got offers, that means haru did, too. I can't lose to him. I'll definitely beat him next time. By the way, I got an offer from the school you decided on, too. It's still conditional, but we might be able to swim on the same team after graduation, too. Yeah, that'd be nice. Did something happen? It's nothing. You've been weird since yesterday. You lost momentum for a second during the race, too, didn't you? Are you in a slump? Sosuke, let's go outside. I said it was nothing. Then let me ask, how was it swimming in the relay? You said it yourself, didn't you? I feel like I might figure something out if I swim relay with you. I don't know why myself, though. But I want to find that something. Did you find that something? I don't know. What did you say?! I said, I don't know! I thought I said only those who really wanted to swim relay would be added to the team. And you're telling me, "I don't know"? Sosuke, you weren't serious about this? There's no way I wouldn't be serious about swimming with you! Then why? It's because I'm serious that I can't just fake it! But I am sure about one thing. I want to swim more. This isn't enough. Then swim. Swim as many times as it takes for you to find it. Yeah. Huh? Oh, yamazaki-senpal! Why are you here? Your form is a mess because you're too tired. Y-you were watching? You won't get better just by swimming as much and as hard as you can. You should rest a little. I-I'm sorry. But with my time, I have to swim more than everyone... If you're reckless, you won't even be able to keep doing the things you can do. I'll watch you. Huh? What did you say? I'm saying I'll watch you practice. After you take a break, that is. You want to swim with rin, don't you? Yes! Is that ai practicing by himself again today? Your legs are too far apart again! Sosuke... That's better. Hey, where are you going? Out. What about practice? Sorry, I'm gonna skip today. This can't be... No way... He broke iwashimizu-senpai's record! Nitori-senpai's amazing! Wasn't it because someone taught him well? Shut up. That was amazing, nitori-senpail I'm sure you'll make it into the regional tournament relay now! Nothing's been decided yet, momo-kun! But thanks. What kind of practice did you do? Do you have a secret trick or something? No, yamazaki-senpai just helped me practice... No fair! Teach me, too! It's too much work. C'mon, please! Ai. I haven't decided whether or not to let you swim in the tournament yet. Don't let your guard down. Yes, sir! Nakagawa shota. Yes, sir! Minami kazuki. Yup. Ryono dai. Yeah! These are the members of the freestyle relay team. Next is the medley relay team. Backstroke, mikoshiba momotaro. Yes, sir! Breaststroke, nitori aiichiro. Yes, sir! Whoa... Butterfly, yamazaki sosuke. Yeah. And I will be swimming freestyle. Everyone, please rest well to prepare for tomorrow. That is all! Yes, sir! I look forward to swimming with you, nitori-senpai yeah, me too! Sosuke. Huh? Let's swim without any regrets tomorrow. Yeah. Stag beetle, stag beetle! Ow! Big bro! Are you turning in the order sheet for the relay? Let me see. Hey, give it back, big bro! You're in it, too? Of course. Not even you can beat me in backstroke. So this is matsuoka's perfect team, huh? Perfect team...? Rin-senpai, yamazaki-senpai, nitori-senpail let's swim with this perfect team! I was just thinking you were taking a long time. What are you saying out of the blue? I just heard about last year's tournament from my brother! It's something that would normally seem impossible, but with everyone's power becoming one, there was a miracle! It was so cool! I was really moved! And then, I just couldn't contain myself... I know how you feel, so just calm down. Well, now that all four of us are here, let's practice relay exchanges in the sub pool. Let's go quickly! Nitori-senpai, hurry! Oh no, I'm starting to get nervous now. What are you getting nervous about practice for? All right, let's go! Yes, sir! Yeah! What's wrong, sosuke? Sorry, I messed up the timing. That's not like you. Yeah. I'm gonna get something to drink. Men's 100 m freestyle, group 5. Big brother! This time, rin-San and haruka-senpai are in different groups, huh? Haru-chan's in the next group. Ready... Go! Ready... fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Wow, he's already in the lead. He's heading into the turn! Go! He's widening his lead even more! No one can catch up to rin-chan's speed! He's so fast! "Kobayashi yuto" "matsuoka rin" "wakamori shuji" emre es reas I saa rr er re rr ste t f er teria e ee ss va se tt ee yeah! Big brother! His time is good enough for the finals! I mean, he'll probably make it! The captain's amazing! Yeah, yeah, matsuoka! Yes! Men's 100 m freestyle, group 6. Next is nanase-San's group, huh? What is that guy doing...? Haru! What are you doing? Why did you do that?! It has nothing to do with you. What the hell? All the scouts are watching this important match! You could definitely... Men's 100 m butterfly, group 3. Rin-senpail captain! Ready... Go! Ready... fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Whoa... "Sakuratown dolphin club" "sano swimming club” "akisaka swimming club" I'm frustrated that we lost, but it was pretty good for our first time as a team! We should use this frustration to motivate us for next... I've had enough. Huh? Relay is not for me. Losing because of someone else, or even if we win, not winning by my own strength. That's lame. You little...! What did you just say?! Of course he'd get mad if you talked bad about relays. The relay rin's dad swam is really important to him. I know that much. Besides, it's not like I was saying something bad about his dad. Then you should just swim with him for him! Swim for him? Huh? Whoa... Doing something for each other... That's not how rin and I are. Really? Well, you two are rivals, after all. Rivals, huh? I've found people who want to swim a relay with me. What? What's wrong, sosuke? Did something happen? Ai was worried. It's nothing. You were weird this morning when we were practicing in the sub pool, too. You disappeared suddenly... I said, it's nothing. You've been missing practice sometimes, too. Where did you go? Sosuke, don't tell me... I said, it's nothing! Sosuke. It's my treat. You hurt your shoulder, didn't you? Let me see... stop it. Since when? This morning. It's not as bad as it looks. Stop pretending! It's not like you suddenly hurt it this morning. I can't lie to you, can I? That's right. I hurt it about two years ago. Because I was training too hard. Didn't you say you were scouted? That you'd already decided on a college? Sorry. That was a lie. I don't have anywhere to go. You're going to watch the next race too, right? Yeah, let's get a seat closer to the front! Let's go somewhere else. Rin-senpail yamazaki-senpail nitori-senpai, did you see the individual medley just now? Everyone was super fired up! Forget that, momo-kun! Have you seen rin-senpai and yamazaki-senpai? Hm? Why? Why did you go so far as to lie and transfer to samezuka? We're rivals. It's better if we're not on the same team. That's what I always thought. So when you said you were transferring to lwatobi, I watched you go without saying anything. Even after starting middle school, I continued to swim single-mindedly. You were fighting all alone in Australia. I thought I would work hard for my own dream, too. "National middle school sports tournament" "swimming competition" I thought I would work hard for my own dream, too. "National middle school sports tournament" "swimming competition" "national middle school sports tournament" "swimming competition" after a while, the letters from you stopped. After a while, the letters from you stopped. But I kept on believing. I believed that you would definitely break through that wall. After starting high school, I became even more obsessed with training. To make my own dream come true. Someday, when I stood on the stage of the world, I knew that you would be there, too, rin. I continued training hard every day. Around that time, there was no one left who could beat me. It was at that time... I started feeling like something was wrong with my shoulder. But I ignored it and kept swimming. But it got worse as the days went on. I couldn't give up because of a little thing like this. I had to be stronger... There was still so much I had to do to be faster than anyone else. And then... In the end, I busted my shoulder. It was the summer of my freshman year. It's not surprising, is it? That was when I heard from go... She said you had come back. But I didn't want to see you. I didn't want you, of all people, to see me at a standstill. Rehab, injury, rehab. I repeated that cycle day after day. Depending on my condition, there were races I couldn't participate in. The guys around me overtook me one by one. As the days passed, I grew more and more impatient. I was miserable. And then one day, I realized... My dream would never come true. I decided to quit swimming. Quit swimming...? But before I quit, I went to see you once. It was at last year's regional tournament. You saw that race? Yeah. I wanted to see you one last time because we once shared a dream. There, I saw you struggling. How did it come to this? I thought you'd be able to overcome any wall you hit and push on. But what was wrong? What had happened? That's it. I quit! I quit swimming, once and for all! I was about to call out to you... But I couldn't. But in the relay you swam with nanase and the others... You swam so fiercely, it was as if you were a different person. And you laughed like you were having a lot of fun with your friends. When that happened, hope bloomed in my empty heart. It was a small, but new, dream. It was the dream to swim with you again. At that time, I didn't know... How important it was to swim with your friends. I'm going to quit swimming. But before I do, I want to be a true friend. With you, rin. Why didn't you tell me this sooner?! Why did you hide it? Why?! If I told you, you would've cried, right? No... I wouldn't've... You idiot... Let's go. It's about time for the race to start. What are you saying? You can't swim in that condition! I'll be fine. If you push yourself too hard, you might never be able to swim again! That's fine. That's what I was planning from the start. No, I won't let you do that! We can finally be a team with nitori and mikoshiba. Let me swim. I won't let you. I promise you... I will swim to the end. I want to swim! I want to swim the relay with you guys. But...! Let's swim! Rin-senpail yamazaki-senpail you guys... When did you...? From that day... From the day I watched the relay at regionals last year... I also wanted to swim a relay with you, rin-senpail yamazaki-senpai helped me, and the day has finally come when I can! Yeah! To gather each person's power to create a miracle... Isn't that what a relay is? Then I want to swim the best relay with the four of us! Let's swim! Rin-senpail hey, rin. Show us, too. Show us a scene we've never seen before. Now we will have the men's 100 m medley relay finals. Yamazaki-San's shoulder... Sosuke-kun? I'm proud to be able to swim the relay with you all. Let's enjoy this great stage with everything we've got! We'll produce results with the best swimming. Yeah, we'll show everyone our strength as a team. Ready... Go! Momo's backstroke start! It really is fast! He's already got a lead on iwatobi! Wow! No, iwatobi's closing in! Momo, go! Momo! Who will touch first?! It was practically the same time! All right, that was a good exchange! That guy's gotten better again! But iwatobi's fast, too! Ail nitori-senpail fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! What? That shoulder... Look, they're head-to-head! Yamazaki-senpail what are you doing?! What should you guys be doing right now?! Shouldn't you be cheering your teammates on?! Ready... fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Sosuke-kun's caught up to rei-kun! He's widening his lead! Yamazaki-senpail Sosuke! Go! Last spurt! Rin! They're speeding up quickly! We're counting on you, rin! They entered the turn at the same time! Rin-senpail rin! "Samezuka" "iwatobi" Second, huh...? What was our time? We made it to the nationals! "Iwatobi" "samezuka" "sakagami" wow! Next is the nationals! Yay! Good job, you guys! That was the best! Hey! Jeez, momo-kun. Thanks. Huh? That doesn't suit you, yamazaki-senpai. Rin. I finally found it. Took you long enough! Those who made it to the national tournament from our club are: Ryono in the 800 m freestyle, mizutani in the 200 m breaststroke, matsuoka in the 100 m freestyle, and the medley relay. Four races in all. Brace yourselves for the nationals! Yes, sir! Matsuoka. With your results from this tournament, there have been scouts from even more colleges asking about you. You have your pick of teams to join. You should narrow it down to your top choices soon. Yes, sir. Hey, good practice. Yeah. By the way, there's an airmail letter for you. Huh? Is it good news? Hey, sosuke. Hm? What are you gonna do after you graduate? Dunno. Maybe go back to my parents' house and help my dad with his work? You're really going to quit swimming...? Yeah. Don't make that face. My dream has already come true. Now... Hey, nanase. Let me talk to you for a sec. What do you want? You stood up in the middle of the race during the last tournament, huh? That has nothing to do with you. Even if it has nothing to do with me, it has something to do with rin. If you come to a standstill, rin might, too. You said something like that to me before. I haven't acknowledged you yet. But you're important to rin. I'm sure you realize it, too. So? What about it? Rin's potential is pulled out when he swims with you. He needs you. Why are you so hung up about rin? I want him to stand on the stage of the world. Where I couldn't stand myself. You have amazing talent. You shouldn't keep lying around doing nothing. You need to take a step forward! That's all I wanted to say. Later. Is everyone here? Yes, sir! We will have a one-week break from club activities starting the day after tomorrow. The next time we meet will be at the national tournament. Those entering the tournament will get there two days early to make some final adjustments. Until then, make sure you get enough rest and keep in good condition. Yes, sir! Hey, rin. What're you staring off into space for? Oh. Sorry. Rin-senpai and yamazaki-senpai, do you live close to each other? Are you going home together? Yeah... What do you want? I-1 have something for gou-San... Will you give her pyunsuke for me? Pyu... I'll release him back into the mountains. Hey, what are you doing? I raised pyunsuke with love and care! I went to harvest sap and gave him high-protein jelly, "one new message" monitored the temperature around him and raised him very, very carefully! Makoto? "New message" monitored the temperature around him and raised him very, very carefully! Makoto? Hey, what's up? Hello, rin? Sorry, there's something I wanted to talk to you about. You sound kinda down. Did something happen? Yeah, kind of... So that's why he... Jeez, it's not even like him. Yeah. I want haru to see more of the world... I think you're the only one that can push him forward right now. We all love haru, so... We want him to find his own dream, no matter what. Don't include me in that "we." Okay, okay. All right, I'll figure something out. Thanks. I still owe him from last year, anyway. Speaking of which, have you decided what you'll do after graduation yet? Huh? Oh, yeah... I'm thinking of going to college in Tokyo. I see. You found something you wanted to do, huh? I'm glad. Yeah, thanks. I was worried that you'd be so concerned with haru that you wouldn't be able to decide what you wanted to do yourself. I'm fine. But it is a little sad. Yeah... Hey, makoto. Hm? It'd be nice if one day, we could all... See ya. Later. Don't forget to bring something back for me! Are you really going? Hm? Yeah, it's been a while since I got back from Australia. It's not just for haru. I want to remind myself of how I felt back then. But ultimately, I want haru to look at the future... You get a good look on your face when you talk about that guy. Did you say something? Not really. Well then... Sosuke, what do you want me to bring back for you? Hmm... Something that's not sweet. What's that supposed to mean? Something that you like is fine. Something that won't take up too much space in your luggage. Okay, got it. Something not sweet, huh...? Make sure you rest your body properly, sosuke. I know. Take care of yourself on your trip. 1 will. Okay, momo-kun. We'll use this break to Polish our exchanges! Roger that, ai-senpail we'll practice super hard and power up a ton! Hey, you two. You've got this break right before the tournament. Make sure you don't tire yourselves out. But its our first nationals, and I don't want to swim in it while still feeling uneasy about our exchanges... I want to finish in the best position I can to pass it off to rin-senpail ai, don't slow down even right before the goal. Keep your eyes on the goal and relax your knees to get ready... Ah, please wait! I need to take notes... Thank you very much! At the joint practice after the break, I'll help you personally. During the break, make sure you keep stretching. Thank you for your advice! Good morning! Mornin'. Welcome back, rin-senpail I'm back. Did anything happen while we were on break? Everyone's in top condition... Rin-senpai, where's my souvenir? So noisy... jeez... Koala? Kangaroo? Koala? Kangaroo? Here. Yahoo! It's a boomerang! Look! Your arms are coming up too fast. Huh? Watch your center of gravity. Sosuke-senpai sosuke. Sorry I'm late. Welcome back, rin. Yeah, thanks. Jeez... Doing something crazy like that. Yeah, well... But... It was worth it. I see. What's wrong? Isn't there anyone who can beat me? Momo! Please give me a break... Today, us third years will retire. In April, you will have new members and form a new team. I hope that it will be the best team, and that in the future, there will be a new team, and that our dream will continue on. So you should also continue to push forward toward that never-ending dream! Yes, sir! He's not crying today. So, ai! Y-yes, sir! You are the next captain. I'm leaving it to you. Yes, sir! We're counting on youl! Captain nitori! Rin...? Who decided that it wouldn't heal? Huh? So what if it's injured. Don't crush your possibilities on your own. I'm waiting. I'm waiting for you to come back. You would be. Of course you would say that. Well... I'll think about it. Rin-senpail let's go eat! Okay. Sosuke-senpai, please join us! Come on, sosuke. Let's go.

Hey, rin... Actually, there's something that's been bothering me for a while... During the nationals, there was a swimmer that caught my eye. Oh, kinjo from suda-higashi, right? He suddenly got a lot better these past six months in the 100 and the 200. No. Kirishima lkuya. Kirishima...? Yeah. I completely forgot, too, but he was a breaststroke swimmer during middle school. He had a pretty good time back then, but he didn't really appear in any official races in high school. But when I saw him at the tournament... Individual medley... Yeah... There were no weaknesses in any of his strokes... But if that were all, he would've just been an amazing swimmer, and I wouldn't have been so hung up about it. What surprised me was... His swimming was like... Nanase haruka's. What I'll say next is just a feeling I have, but I think he actually wants to swim freestyle. Rin, if you're aiming for the world after this, you won't be able to avoid swimming against him... Kirishima... lkuya... Jeez, it's our last tournament, you could've at least attended the award ceremony, lkuya. You could've seen some of your old friends, you know. The high school from your hometown was in it, right? Iwatobi, was it...? Where are you going? To call my brother. You're so attached to your big brother... Stop saying that. He's so cute. We're finally going to be third years now, too, huh? Let's both do our best. Yeah, first we need to get new club members! This year, we're going to show the new students a scene they've never seen before! What the heck's that supposed to be? Hey, don't laugh! Oh, long time no see! Momotaro-kun and nitori-kun! We heard that you're the new captain, ai-chan! And we heard that ryugazaki-kun is the new captain for your team! Yes, I look forward to the next year! Let's keep up the healthy rivalry between samezuka and iwatobi this year, too. Yes, we would like that, too! Prepare yourselves for the next joint practice, ai-chan! I'm also looking forward to it, hazuki-kun, ryugazaki-kun! Senpai, thanks to you, we were able to make it to regionals... It was really amazing! Thank you very much! Don't cry you guys. A new year is about to start, right? Believe in yourselves! You'll be fine! I'm sure you guys will be able to get results! Yes, sir! Oh, excuse me. From my sister. She says, "don't forget we're going back to grandma's house next week." It looks like I'll be able to see an old friend, too! "Shigeno kisumi" "asahi! Wow, how long has it been? I was so surprised. I should be in lwatobi around then. Will you be free, asahi?" It looks like I'll be able to see an old friend, too! It looks like I'll be able to see an old friend, too! Um, where's your grandma's house again? Huh? Iwatobi-Cho, of course! "Shiina asahi" "seriously?! Then I'll be back in may, so I'll see you then!" Oh, asahi, huh? That takes me back. I wonder if he's doing well? It'd be nice to get everyone together again. Wow, there are so many people... Unimaginable in iwatobi, huh? Yeah... Haru, are you all right? I can't relax... Yeah, me neither. I feel really restless... But... I'm excited, too. Yeah. Me, too. Take your marks... Makoto, are you ready? Yeah. "Once you hit twenty, you're ordinary"... I wonder if I'll look back fondly on these days someday... But, right now... Right now, I want to treasure each day as it comes. Go! Um, the preview for next time is... This is haruka, moge. I have been captured by an evil organization and been transformed into the monster, iwamogera, moge. This isn't what it's about. In march, when haruka-senpai and the others graduate, these four beautiful stories will bring color to early spring. Rei-chan and I will be transformed, too! The biceps brachii muscle versus the soleus muscle. A duel at the iwatobi coast, moge! And then, the true identity of the mysterious trapezius muscle man who appears there is... That's not it!
