KEEP YOUR EVIL EYES OFF ME I have bought a big screen television. Let's do it while watching the television. I'm not coming to your house! That's not fair, Indoo. We've been dating for over a year now. Well, everyone is breaking up and we can't even "make up." But first, learn to speak English. It's "make out" and not "make up". Well, I feel left out because you don't let me in. You can have your way once we get married. Okay. Let's forget about making out. How about just a kiss? Stop! The driver is looking at us. These drivers are scoundrels. You never know when they might pull over and molest you. Are you insane? Hey, look ahead! He won't do anything. But let me do something. You always throw yourself at me! But you won't come home and ask my dad for my hand. Indoo, my love, marriage is a tedious process. First, the parents meet each other. Then we fix a date and time, decide on a venue, print the invites. And then, we'll consummate our marriage. Until then… Let's make a deal. You give me what I want tonight, and I'll meet your dad first thing in the morning. Okay? Here you go. Here's a spare key to my house. I'll wait for you. Please don't break my heart, Indoo. We've reached the mall. Get down and pay the driver. Excuse me, ma'am! I wasn't looking at you through the mirror with a malicious intent. Mr. Bachchan once said in a movie, "No means no." So, I was just checking if this guy was forcing himself on you. Hey! Ma'am, just like every Muslim residing in India isn't a Pakistani, every driver in the world isn't a rapist. Do you understand? Did you hear that? He is guilty conscience. Hello! I'm Indira Gupta. I am also known as Indoo. I'm sure that you've misunderstood me after what you just saw. You must be thinking that I'm a judgmental person. But believe me, you'll do the same if you ever come across the kind of people I've been dealing with. Well, I'm an attractive woman. Be it young boys from college or middle-aged retired men in the colony, everyone waits to catch a fleeting glimpse of me. No, I'm not lying. You can check my profile on social media. The only thing trending in Ghaziabad is #IndooKiJawani. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to New Delhi. Passengers traveling on flight number 86785 from Hyderabad to New Delhi may collect their baggage from belt number five. ARRIVALS Hello. I just landed. Have you sent a car for me? Pardon me. A black Scorpio? Stop the car! Hey! -He isn't stopping! -Stop! -Hey, stop! -Stop! -Stop the car. -Pull over. GHAZIABAD POLICE Give me your license. What seems to be the problem, sir? Listen, this is not a racecourse. You cannot exceed the speed limit here. Forgive us, sir. It won't happen again. We'll see to that later. Let me see your license for now. You'll get a ticket. I don't have my license. Why don't you have it? You're speeding away without a license! You're going to lose your car, man. Step out of the car! -Come on, get out. -Come on! -Driving without a license! -Step out of the vehicle! Listen… Zone three to West Control! A black Scorpio, license plate number DL-3C-BF-3915, is speeding towards Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad after gunning down a Sub-inspector! I repeat, DL-3C-BF-3915. We found the car, sir. We have surrounded it. Okay, sir. Please give me a cigarette. GODDESS KESARI TEMPLE Sir, that's the car. There has been no movement in the past one hour. We're assuming they went inside that house. Fine. Let's move in. We would like to inform our viewers that the police found large quantities of explosives in Patel Nagar, Ghaziabad. They suspect that some terrorists are hiding in the city. UP police are on the lookout for the suspects all across the city. According to the sources, a big terrorist attack is being planned. Neither police nor the CBI has any information on the terrorists yet. Their search is on. Dad, please turn down the volume. I can't concentrate. I'm preparing for the IIT entrance examination. This is not a joke. Unbelievable! Pakistanis have once again infiltrated our country, and he wants to go to IIT. I think that we are wasting money by sending him to an engineering college. Let him join IIT if he wants to. As if the faculty is waiting to give him the red-carpet treatment. Am I right? I would've answered your question if you weren't my mom's husband. Really? Ask him to keep quiet. Let's assume that I am not her husband. -Now, tell me. What will you do? -Mind your own business! What? -Stop talking nonsense! -Answer me. -What did you want to say? -Mom, ask him to shut up. Tell me! -You're the limit! -Get out of here! You two are constantly at each other's throats! -Why don't you make him understand? -Keep quiet. Bunty, go upstairs and study in Indoo's room. Go on. God knows what she's up to with her friend. No, I'm not coming over. What happened, Indoo? I promise, I'll meet your parents tomorrow morning. And what if you don't? Indoo… I'm always true to my word. If you come today, I will definitely come tomorrow. You and your promises! I won't be fooled by you. I know all your tricks. You're dangling a carrot in front of me only to attain your motive. Listen, Indoo. You hold no special treasure. Everyone has the same goodies. You should stop taking… my loyalty for granted. Why are you after me if I am not special? Go find someone else! Go to hell! Damn… You go to hell! Did you break up again? He is more interested in having sex than getting married! It is not his fault. He's a man. That's how God has made him. This girl right here, exuding pure swag, is my best friend, Sonal. She's two years younger than the internet, and yet her knowledge is unbound. Sonal knows about everything. I must say, you guys are rather unlucky. You are at the mercy of Google… whereas I learn everything from Sonal without even asking for it. But that's just too risky. What if I have sex with him and he refuses to marry me? Indoo, you are still shackled by social taboos. This is 2020, my friend! It's the era of social media. Earlier, men used to mark their territory after they got married. And in today's world, men mark their territory first and then get married. Did your boyfriend mark his territory? I wish! Uday has got some problem. Is he impotent? I don't know. Your guy seems to be quite forward. You should take things forward before he runs away. Don't waste your time. Cook up a nice excuse for your parents, get ready and surprise that pervert. Go on! Okay, Sonal. I'll go and get ready. Listen! Make sure you wear a matching set. Please stop over there. Yes, stop right here. You need to calm down. The lights are still on. He must be awake. Go and kindle his desires. I'll get going. My shy guy will be calling me any minute now. -All the best. -Thanks, Sonal. Go. Let's go. You should always watch out for suspicious activities in your surroundings. If you come across any suspicious person or object, inform the police immediately. Do not trust strangers. Surprise! You should never trust a stranger. Your life is in your hands. And it's your decision. I thought it was you. Alka, is that you? Shameless woman. Can we sort this out later? The least you can do is apologize, you witch. I made a mistake. You deserved to be slapped. Please. I don't want to make a scene here. Oh, damn! Bunty's sister is so hot. You know, she's single these days. -Are you serious? -He's right. My sister told me that she just had a breakup. That's good news! Yes, bro. She's gorgeous! Bunty. Hey, Bunty! What are you doing with the ladies? Come here and eat with us. Mom. -Yes? -I'll be with my friends. Alright. Don't forget to eat. -Sure. -Okay. -Come here, Bunty. -Kittu, how are you? Are you prepared for the entrance exam? That's the reason I have called you here. Only you can help me get through. -Of course, dude! -Have some. What about that… Hey… Indoo! Listen. It's… it's been so long since we met. -Hello, Uncle Ranjeet. -Hello. Hello, Uncle Pran. Hello, Uncle Prem. Hello, dear. So… where have you been working these days? I've taken a break, Uncle. I'm planning to join the airline industry. Oh! Do you want to be a pilot? No, an air hostess. Air hostess? But air hostesses wear skimpy-- I mean they have to wear short skirts, right? The skirts are this short. I've worn shorter skirts in school. No, my dear. -You were just a kid back then. -Yes. You are a young adult now. -Dear-- -Indoo. Can I have a word with you? -Excuse me. -My dear… -Listen. -Dear… -What is it? -What's up? This is Kittu. We go to the same classes. I'm helping him clear the entrance exam. I can see that. He considers you as his idol. Why? Does he also want to be an air hostess? Pilot. I'll make you touch the skies. You explore the skies with him. I'll go and get myself a cold drink. Forget about her. -Can I have a soda? -Yes, ma'am. Drinking without me? I'm going crazy, Sonal. I feel like everyone in Ghaziabad, except for my father and my brother, wants to mark me as their territory! Who is he? Excuse me? Can you please come here? Indoo, meet Uday, my boyfriend and my husband-to-be. -Sonal, get me a soda on the rocks. -Sure. -Can I have a soda on the rocks? -Sure, ma'am. Thank you. Here you go. Is that Uday? Yes, that's him. But didn't you say he had some problem? It doesn't look like he's got a problem. He wasn't always like this. This change was brought about last week. Come on. Let's sit down and talk. Go on. When you caught Satish with Alka at his place and told me what happened, I have to admit that I was petrified! I decided I wouldn't wait for Uday to ask. I went straight home and watched a couple of adult films. And then on Sunday, when my parents weren't at home, I called Uday over. I played some slow English songs and asked him to do the deed. And I have witnessed a lot of change in our relationship after that day! Now he treats me like I am his wife. He has started treating me like his personal property. Just like our fathers treat our mothers. Everything is sorted. Uday is the one for me. -Excuse me! Can I have another soda? -Yes, ma'am. So, you mean… I wouldn't have faced this if I'd had sex with Satish. Right. Excuse me? Is this for that lady there? Yes, sir. I'll give it to her. -Okay. -Okay, thank you. No matter what, there's no way I can patch things up with Satish. He's a scoundrel! Who is asking you to patch things up with him? You can prepare for the future instead. What do you mean? Hello, sis! What do you want? You ordered a drink, right? -I thought I'll get it for you. -Thank you. I'm having some girl talk with my friend here. So, you may leave. Okay. Bye. Who was that nutcase? My brother's friend. He's a pest. Ignore him. You were saying something about being prepared. It's not a big deal, girl. The lights go off. So, you can't see much. It lasts for around 30 to 45 minutes. The boy will first kiss you. Okay? Then he'll feel you, with a few kisses here and there. This will go on for around 30 to 45 minutes, okay? Amid all of this, he will mark his territory. He'll be exhausted after that and he won't even be able to move. And you'll be thinking it wasn't that big a deal after all. You were unnecessarily worried. Well, real life is nowhere near to what is shown in adult films. But I'd recommend that you watch a couple of adult films for your knowledge. Do you have any adult films? I'll bring them over to your place. Perfect. Come over tomorrow. My family is going to Delhi for a week to finalize my brother's admission and accommodation. Perfect. I'll stay over. We'll watch it together. I'm so excited. This is going to be fun. Hello! Mic testing! Hello! Hello, ladies and men! Men are always gentlemen! Today, on the occasion of Parag and Alka's wedding, I have arranged a special surprise for all of you today. That's right! A special surprise! She'll mesmerize everyone with her performance. And the special surprise is… Killer Suhani! Make up! What did you make me drink? I'm going crazy It was surely spiked For I am feeling dizzy What did you make me drink? I'm going crazy It was surely spiked For I am feeling dizzy I was so naive about all these things My heart is all set to commit a sin Oh, my heart! It hasn't slept a wink at night Oh, my heart! It sets fire in the rain Oh, my heart! It sets fire in the rain I'm in a good mood I've shed my inhibitions as well My face has a new glow for you I've managed to convince my mother I've managed to hide it from my father Just don't spill any liquor on my dress Listen up, you crazy enchanting girl Listen up, you crazy enchanting girl Oh, my heart! I won't let you go home tonight Oh, my heart! It sets fire in the rain Oh, my heart! It sets fire in the rain Your girl looks hungover. You were the one who got her drunk. You should also be the cure for her hangover. Please stay in, my dear. I feel that even I will have to stay indoors given the antics you pulled at the wedding yesterday. It's only a matter of one week. Please don't do anything stupid. I'll be back as soon as your brother's admission is done. Why did we have to go today? Mr. Duggal has organized a grand prayer meet in the colony! Why can't you enroll in some other college? You can stay back. I'll take care of his admission. Really? If I leave the two of you alone, only one of you will come back home. You need to decide whose side you are on, Mom. Shut up! I'm neither on your side nor his. I side with our Goddess. -Glory be to-- -The Goddess! -Everyone together! -Hail the Goddess! Once again… Hey, handsome! What took you so long to come to me? Now that you're here, show me what kind of an animal-- I will not do anything that's being done there! Disgusting! Indoo… stop abstaining from doing adult things. Okay? You have just had a breakup for now. If you make a fuss after marriage, you will end up getting divorced. Why do people make adult films? So that women like you can watch them and learn all the dirty little tricks to be on a par with men. What does an Indian man want? What does he want? He wants his wife to be a cultured woman during the day, and a wanton at night. Really? We've grown up watching our mothers preach about being cultured. But you need to watch these films to be a wanton. You're right. Turn on the laptop and start watching. Don't waste your time. Go. Focus. Hey, handsome! What took you so long to come to me? Now that you're here, show me what kind of an animal you are. I've been waiting since ages. Now is the time. Come to me, baby. Come to me. Are you serious? She was watching adult movies on her laptop last night. You guys are really made for each other. You have been doing that for the past two years. Kittu, your mother is looking for you. You need to get some things for the prayer meet. -I'll get going. -Alright. Listen! Buy a nice perfume for me. -Sure. -Don't worry, Kittu. You'll smell like a rose tonight. Prem, did you look at the sketch of that Pakistani guy on the third page? -Take a look at it. -Yes. He looks so innocent but he's a terrorist! I'm craving a fruit cake. We'll take one of those. -We'll take two fruit cakes. -Should we try the one with cashew? -Yes, that'll be better. -This chocolate one also looks good. -Hello, dear! -Hello. Hello, Uncle. So, dear-- So, dear… have your parents left for Delhi, right? They have gone for Bunty's admission, right? Yes, Uncle. Bunty has gone with them. What? I mean… are you all alone at home? Yes, Uncle. Make sure that your room-- I mean, just be careful. These are bad times. Did you read today's newspaper? They've released a Pakistani's sketch. He's hiding somewhere in Ghaziabad. So, just be careful, dear. Make sure you lock all the doors and windows before you to go sleep. Why does she need to lock them? You can call me. I'll come over. I'll sleep outside if needed. Why? Why indeed? Why only you? We all will be there. -There's no need, Uncle. -Did you hear that? Do you think a Pakistani would ever dare to enter my house? I'm a true Indian. I'll thrash him and send back to his country. I dare him to touch me! I can thrash not one but three Pakistanis at one go. My dear… why are you scaring us? We aren't Pakistanis. We are your well-wishers. What? Satish is the only real terrorist in your life. He's already gotten into a relationship with someone else! That's what I have been trying to tell you, Indoo. The world is progressing faster than you can imagine. You should move on as well, girl. Find a handsome boy, have sex with him and make him your boyfriend. How can I have sex with him before I make him my boyfriend? Have a one-night stand with him. A one-night stand? Pick any movie that is based on a one-night stand. It could be in Hindi or English. A one-night stand story never ends on that one night. Indoo, nowadays, all love stories begin with a one-night stand. I've seen it in movies. A boy approaches a girl at a big party and says, "Hey, baby! Can I buy you a drink?" The girl doesn't hold back. She says, "Just a drink? How about some desert as well?" And in the very next scene, both of them are shown naked in bed. You don't even realize when they did it. But I don't attend parties. Only those three oldies hit on me at local parties. Why don't you find a match online? You'll find better options. Do you mean on Fakebook? No, that's old news. Join Dinder. What's Dinder? It's a dating app. Once you log in, you'll get to see the profiles of thousands of boys. You'll also know how far they are from you. You'll know if they are a few kilometers away or in some other state or country. All you have to do is swipe right on the boy you like. If he likes you back, he will also swipe right and you two will be a match. And then, you can start texting. Decide a time and place to meet and have a one-night stand. But how do I tell him that I want a one-night stand? You wouldn't have to tell him that. Every man in the world joins a dating app only for one-night stands. All you need to do is make a profile and keep swiping right. Your match will handle the rest. That's great, Sonal. You are so knowledgeable. It's important. You never know what app comes in handy in one's hour of need. Give me your phone. I'll help you make your profile.

Single ladies' song Oh, we have a match! Show it to me! Baby, please send nude pics. Yuck! What is this nonsense? Well, not everyone is a gentleman. I'm not talking to you! There are no decent boys on Dinder. Stop right here! -What happened? -This guy seems good. Show it to me. Samar. Two miles away. He has sent me a text. What is it? Hi, India. This is Samar. India? Must be a typo. You are the one who made that typo! You forgot the letter "R" while typing Indira. Let me correct it. Wait. Don't do it. Operate using a secret name. It will ensure your safety. That's true. -What should I reply? -Introduce yourself. Hi, Samar. This is India. Ma'am, shall we go ahead? Wait a minute. Nice name. India. Thank him and ask him what he does. Thanks a lot. What do you do? I'm a musician. What do you do? Awesome! He's an artist. I am applying for an air hostess' job. He looks good and is a musician. He'll write songs for you. I think he's perfect. Don't jump to conclusions. We have just started chatting. You never know, he might be lying. You're right. An air hostess' job is very difficult. My mom was an air hostess. Ma'am? Please wait. We are doing something very important here. Ask him why he is on Dinder. What are you doing here? How the hell will he understand what you mean by "here"? Oh, sorry. What are you doing on Dinder? Hey, move aside! I am looking for a nice girl for friendship. Bloody liar! I understand the nice girl bit, but what does he mean by friendship? He might be a nice boy. Really? Don't be foolish, Indoo. All the boys in the world want the same thing. But he does seem a little shy. But that's okay. You can initiate. Tell him, "But I'm looking for something else." Am I doing the right thing, Sonal? Do you think what happened with you was right? It wasn't. And this is nothing as compared to that. Can I give you want you want? He got the hint. He's smart. Now, tell him… "If you're a nice good looking man, you earn well, you're handsome, have nice quadriceps, then yes, you can give me what I want." I am not going to type that. I'm not sending him a marriage proposal on Dinder. I… I'll tell him I cannot decide over the phone. -We'll need to meet for that. -Alright. Park it on the side of the road! I am free. Where do you want to meet? Dinder is such a wonderful app! You've fixed a meeting with a boy in just ten minutes! Where will you meet him? Where do I meet him? How about Café Coffee Bay? Will you have a one-night stand at Café Coffee Bay? I'll meet him there and then decide whether I can take him home or not. As if he's going to show you his true colors at the coffee shop! Well, that's true. Come on, get aside! If you don't want to meet, it's okay. If you keep thinking, you'll lose the guy. I don't care. I don't want to bring the wrong guy home in haste. Stop it, Indoo. You couldn't even judge the guy you were dating for six months. Do you think you'll be able to judge a new guy? Did you reject him? I sent him my address. Let me see. "Milan Niwas, block number 13, Kavi Nagar, Ghaziabad. Let's meet at 6:00 p.m. Also, carry a bag with you." Why do you need the bag? Why should I tell you? Oh, I see! It's a secret! Well, that's okay. It's your day. You're going to hit the jackpot tonight. Greetings. The plan is on for tonight. Please stop right here. You need to work on your riding skills. You caused a traffic jam over here. -Unbelievable. -I think I should take some precaution. You're right. You don't want to get pregnant after a one-night stand. I didn't mean that! I mean that precaution is necessary as well. But I have invited a stranger home. I need to make some arrangements for my safety. Yes, your safety is important as well. Go inside and make arrangements for your safety. I'll talk to Uday and arrange for some "precaution" for you. -Go on. -Bye. Hey, listen! Don't worry. I'll wear a matching set. Attagirl! Let's go and cause some more traffic jams. ENGLISH PHARMACY Sir, I need two packets of condom.

He's already at my doorstep in a single chat. Sonal is certainly right about all the boys. These scoundrels are always ready for one-night stands. Well, anyway, it's not like I plan on marrying him. India? Yes. Hello, Samar. Hi. It's good that you brought a bag. Oh, yes. But, why do you need the bag? You finally got the time to check the water purifier! I made a complaint long back! I had called you last week, but you didn't show up! And today, you're here to check the water purifier out of the blue! I can't help it, ma'am. We get many complaints in a day. I've myself made a complaint for my water purifier. It's been three months since I've been waiting for a resolution. Well, alright. I'm sure your turn will come very soon. Please come in. Okay. What can I do now? Welcome. Please come in. I am sorry about that drama. You know, people start talking behind your back. No. I totally understand. People here just talk behind your back. People in my colony would tear me apart. Why are you standing? -Have a seat. -Thank you. I must say you act well. Ever since I was a kid. Would you like something? No, thank you. I don't drink. No, I meant tea or coffee. I don't drink either. Okay. Do you think I am lying? I attended a wedding two days ago and you were there as well. -Shit. -You were pretty sloshed. No, I had ordered for a soda. I don't know what they spiked it with. I'm not like that. What do you mean? -No-- -I don't judge those who like to drink. I mean one cannot be bad just because they drink. It's just a matter of choice. I just like tea and coffee. What would you like more? What do you like? Tea or coffee? I like the tea that my mom makes and the coffee that I make. So, who's going to make what now? Well, there's no one else at home. -Coffee. -Oh, thank you. -Cheers. -Cheers. What does your brother do? He just cleared high school. He wants to be an engineer. Oh! And you plan to join the airlines. That's really nice. Thank you. You are the first person who didn't discourage me. Perhaps because your mother was also an air hostess. Well, no one objects when guys work as the cabin crew. But everyone judges a girl when she chooses to be an air hostess. That's not fair. It's good to know that you don't think so. So, you tell me. What kind of music do you make? Well, so far I've been making songs only on requests. But now I'm thinking about making a single. What kind of music do you like? Bollywood. Party songs, romantic songs, sad songs and even rap songs. Anything works as long as it's Bollywood. I also love Bollywood. -Where are you from? -Hyderabad. Hyderabad? So, how come you're here? I'm visiting my granduncle. I'm here for a week. You know the temple of Goddess Kesari in Patel Nagar? Next to Bablu Hair Salon? He lives in that vicinity. I take that route every day. Small world, right? So, will you stay for dinner? Well, I'll surely feel hungry if I'm staying here for long. No, I mean I'll have to order food from the restaurant. Oh, please allow me. -I'll order from Gomato. -No, I'll order it. -My phone-- -Listen! You made coffee for me. So, let me treat you with dinner. Amazing! Would you like vegetarian or non-vegetarian food? How about some chicken? -Biryani? -That would be the best! Jagdish Kumar is on his way with your order. Done. So… what's up? All's well. Well… do you watch movies? Yes, of course. What kind of movies do you like? -Old Hindi movies. -Like? Like… Kashmir Ki Kali. That's my favorite as well. Shall we watch it together? KASHMIR KI KALI Who is it? Oh, shit! -We touched. -You! It's okay. This is how it begins. I should take the next step. He's a decent guy. I shouldn't be afraid. Shit! He's holding my hand! What's next? A kiss? Alright. Let's go for it. God has been generous with you He has made me your beau Oh, temptress! How do I praise your beauty? My words won't do justice God has been generous with you He has made me your beau Oh, temptress! How do I praise your beauty? My words won't do justice I have seen Kashmir I have seen Kanyakumari And yet I never Came across a girl like you Ever since the time I met you I have lost control of myself My heart is yours It now belongs to you Come closer to me We'll see what transpires My heart is yours It now belongs to you Come closer to me We'll see what transpires Oh, my! If I fall in love with you I'll be taking too big a risk They keep tormenting me They are driving me crazy Your eyes are intoxicating You can set me on fire With a single touch You've been stealing glances A bit too much You are the one You are the only one I belong with My heart is yours It now belongs to you Come closer to me We'll see what transpires My heart is yours It now belongs to you Come closer to me We'll see what transpires There's this strange feeling in my heart I have butterflies in my stomach I'm lost in your dreams My brain, my heart My brain, my heart You rule my brain, my heart And my soul My heart is yours It now belongs to you Come closer to me We'll see what transpires My heart is yours It now belongs to you Come closer to me We'll see what transpires Yes, Mom? How are you? Is everything alright? Yes. I was getting ready for bed. Okay. I don't think I'll be getting any sleep here. You know your Aunt's house is small and it doesn't have many rooms. I have to share the room with these two monsters. Anyway, I'll talk to you later. Take care. Yes, Mom. Good night. -Sorry. -No, that's alright. Well, I wasn't crazy. But your innocence is making me lose my mind. Leave me. Let me go. No. Now that I've held you, I won't let go of you. You can't trust someone as mad as me. Sometimes, I even bite. Move! Have you really lost it? Yes, everyone seems to have lost it today. You and me, these flowers and buds, and the weather. Look over there! The clouds! I have never done this before. This is my first time. Oh… okay. You didn't tell me. Sorry. Listen, I understand if you don't want to do this. No, it's not that. -That's the reason why we've met. -No, I totally understand. I mean, your first time is supposed to be very special. You always remember it. You cannot do it with just anyone. The person must be special. I understand. Right? Actually, I thought Satish would be my first as well as my last. But that didn't happen. Is Satish your boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. It doesn't seem like you have moved on. After all, I'm a human. How can I move on in just two weeks? I'm an Indian woman and I'm very emotional. How is that interrelated? I mean girls all around the world are emotional. -So are the boys. -Nonsense! That scoundrel already started dating another girl. How do you know that girl was his new girlfriend? She could have been a friend or a cousin. I am sure about it! The way she was holding him, anyone could've guessed what was cooking between them! Please don't tell me that she was holding him tightly because she was scared to sit on the bike! I know how boys are! They all want the same thing. They feign love just to get what they want. Now take us for example. My friend forced me. She insisted that I practice sex so that I don't lose my boyfriend when I get into a relationship. I took her advice, used Dinder and called you here. But, why did you come here? Your intentions are quite clear. There you are with me now! I think I should leave. No, please. I'm sorry. Please have a seat. I… I didn't mean that. Please stay for dinner. Sorry. You are crazy, Indoo. Who says such things? Tell me something. How does he look? He's good looking and he seems very decent and well educated. We even watched Kashmir Ki Kali together. I'm sure he's irritated with me now. What should I do? No, he's not irritated with you. He's a boy! Boys start getting irritated only after they've got what they want from you. Do one thing. Do you remember the adult movie you watched last night? Just behave like the actress of that movie. Everything will be okay. Don't worry. Alright. Bye. -Go away! -Go away! My baby hasn't eaten anything. Open your mouth. Please sit down. I'll sit down as well. Sit next to me. Have you watched any adult movie? Why do you want to know that? I have seen a few of them. Do you know what the actresses do in the movie? What do they do? India, are you okay? India? Hey, handsome! What took you so long… to come to me? Now that you are here… show me what kind of an animal you are. India, I don't think… I have been waiting for such a long time. For ages! -Now is the time. -I don't think so. Now is the time. -Now is the time-- -Shit! I'm sorry. I had seen that in the adult film. -Let me help you. -No, that's fine. I feel like an idiot. I'm going to kill Sonal! Do you have Pakistani citizenship as well? Yes. I have Pakistani citizenship just like you have Indian citizenship. But you told me that you're from Hyderabad. So what? Just like Kashmir is in India as well as in Pakistan, similarly, Hyderabad is a city in Pakistan. Is there a problem? No. Why would I have a problem? Pakistan is such a nice country. No wonder you are a musician! The best musicians are from Pakistan. Javed Bashir, Reshma, Atif Aslam. The best! Nothing like that. There are great musicians in your country as well. Bappi Lahiri. Anu Malik. -Pritam. -That's true. Make yourself comfortable. I'll go to the washroom and be right back. Let me take my phone. So what if he's a Pakistani? He's still a human being. And you yourself said that he's a nice guy. I didn't know he was a Pakistani. Do you want me to make out with a Pakistani? No way! The first time is supposed to be special. And the person should be special as well. Indoo, tell me one thing. Didn't Uncle Ranjeet mention something about a Pakistani this morning? It was on the news as well. What if he's the guy? Call the cops. Sir. We just received information from IB about two guys. They have sent a picture of one. His name is Maqsood Ibrahim. He's the guy who shot Lakhan. What about the second guy? We don't have much information on him yet. All we know is he's in India disguised as a Pakistani tourist. We don't know his location or the name he's been using. Get me the details of all the Pakistanis currently residing in India. And share Maqsood Ibrahim's picture with all the news channels. Okay. We need to tighten the security, Chautala. We cannot let these two terrorists roam freely. And that's how you invite trouble for yourself. Back then, I didn't know this isn't just a little trouble, but a catastrophe! The climax is yet to come, my friend! Satish, please try to understand. I'm a married woman now. I can't come over. Come on, Alka! So what if you're married? Believe me. We can cheat on our partners. One last time, please. We'll try a new position. Go to hell! No. No. No way. Just a second. Hello? Hi… how are you, Indoo? What do you want? I'm sorry, Indoo. I shouldn't have done that to you. I'll never repeat my mistake. Please forgive me. -Indoo-- -Where are you? Do you want to meet? My family is out of town. You can come over if you want. I'll be at your doorstep in ten minutes. My God! Look at the guy's confidence! They want girls at their beck and call. They shamelessly cheat and then plead for forgiveness. -Careful! -Thanks, bro. I am not a bro but beau. Who is he? Why are you asking her? You can ask me. Who are you? I'm her boyfriend. Is there a problem? What about me? You are a fool. But you said that no one's home. No. She said that her family is out of town. She didn't say anything about her boyfriend. Why did you call me? Come here. We've got nothing to hide. A little PDA is acceptable. So, everything-- You-- Did you do it? You should ask what and where did all of this happen. Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen-- But the kitchen's that way! When you're standing in front of a hot girl like her, you should pay attention to her and not the surroundings! Do you understand why she didn't do it with you? It's okay. Keep this in mind for the next time. Get out! You ripped him apart and taught him a lesson. He'll never cheat on anyone again. -Get dressed. -Hey! I need to get him out of here. We are done. Get out… No, I can't say that. I'll put on an act. I have a fever-- No. Okay, let's do this. Long live India! I'm feeling a bit feverish. So… let's eat our dinner and conclude this meeting. Let me check what's wrong-- Hey, you terrorist! How dare you touch me! What? Wait, did I miss something? I know why you are here. You saw me drunk at that wedding. So, you thought of coming to my place to mark your territory. Don't you dare touch me! -What? -Get out of my house right now! The meeting-- Everything's canceled! Leave right now. Get out! Unbelievable. If I knew you were so judgmental and cheap, I would've never come here! Bloody illiterate lout! No, don't look at me like that! I got excited for no reason. You know what, after talking to you, I called up my friend in Pakistan and told him. But I swear, you turned out to be a big disappointment, India Gupta! Are you done? Now, get out! Hey! The door's that way. Hey! My bag's over there. Well, then, get it! It might contain RDX. Out! Enough of your drama! Make yourself scarce! So, I was telling you about Prem. Prem misinterpreted that. Indoo. Why are you standing outside? Hello, Uncle! Are you scared to be all alone in the house? No, Uncle. I was just-- -Hello, Aunt. -Hello, dear. It's late in the night. Don't stand outside. Okay? Go inside. Your family is out of town. It's not that big a deal. If you don't mind, I'll stay over tonight. Sure! Why not? Don't try to be smart! Come on. We're going to the prayer meet. -Yes. -Indoo, you go inside. -Yes. -Yes, Aunt. Go inside. -Good night, Aunt. -Good night, dear. -Good night. -Good night, Uncle. -Let's go. -Come on. -What happened? -You cannot leave. Why not? Everyone's taking this road to go to the prayer meet. I'll be sullied if anyone sees you leave my house. This is strange! On one hand, you called me a terrorist, and on the other hand, you want me to stay here all night just to save yourself from humiliation. Are you insane? Step away from me! There's nothing insane about this. I cannot speak for you, but this is the trend in our country. We don't mind losing our life but the reputation should be protected at all costs. You are going to sit over there until the prayer meet concludes. Do not make any noise. Sir, we've found Ibrahim. Constable Jagdish saw him entering a building in Gaganpuri. Let's go get him. He went inside, and hasn't come out yet. We have surrounded the building, sir. We are sure he's hiding inside. Can we go inside? -All clear, sir. -We can go in. Tell me the truth! What is the name of your friend? What's your plan? Tell me! Kill me if you want, but I won't tell you anything. You may continue thrashing him. He'll either die or blurt out his partner's whereabouts. It will work either way. By the way, what's your mission? You watch a lot of Hindi movies, right? Really? You said you loved Bollywood as well! So, what changed? I told you that I like old Hindi films. That's it. Now I get why you liked the movie Kashmir Ki Kali. -Why? -You want Kashmir! I'm not going to let you take our Kashmir. It belongs to us and it always will! Excuse me! I don't want your Kashmir. Then, why are you here? Have you planned another attack? Listen, you dolt! I have come to Mumbai for my mom's treatment. My parents flew back to Pakistan two days ago. My relatives asked me to come to Ghaziabad. We have an ancestral mansion here in Ghaziabad. The house is filled with oldies and I was getting bored. I thought of meeting new people in India. So, I made a profile on Dinder and I swiped right on you. Little did I know that Indian girls are like you! I'm not planning any attack here. I am not a terrorist. But you are a Pakistani. Good Lord! I want to use your bathroom. Where is it? No, you cannot go in there alone. I'll go with you. Or else, just wait for some time. I'll ask the food delivery guy to escort you to the bathroom. There's no way I'm letting you go in there alone. God knows what you'll do in there. What is this nonsense? I cannot leave. I cannot use the bathroom. They don't even deliver food on time in your country. There you go. Luck is in your favor. Get up. Quick! -Come on! -What's wrong? -Just come with me! -Hey! Please come along. Get inside. Lock me up in the bathroom instead! -Come on! -Get in and don't say a word! Which horrible perfume are you wearing? Dikny. Bikini? Not Bikini, Dikny. D-K-N-Y. Bunty's not home. I know that. I'm here for you. Why? Bunty asked me to check in on you as you are all alone at home. -I'm fine. You may leave. -Wait! Let me make a call to Bunty. Hello? Bunty? I just stopped by your place. Yes, your sister's fine. She just looks a little scared. The news about terrorists have been making the rounds. What? Do you want me to stay here? That's excellent! Don't worry, bro! No one can lay a finger on Indoo Gupta as long as I'm here. Alright, bye. I don't need anyone's protection! Get lost! Are you sure? This could spoil our friendship. When were we ever friends? I mean my friendship with Bunty. That would be great! Bunty will no longer be in bad company. Indoo. What happened? Is there a problem? Aunt, that's exactly what I was asking her. Bunty is a friend of mine. Don't worry. Go and attend the prayer meet. I'm here to protect Indoo Gupta. See you, Indoo. Don't worry. Just inform Kittu if there's a problem. He's like family. Kittu, give my regards to your father. Okay, Aunt. Bye. Hey! No one can touch you as long as I'm here. Stop right there! Shit. THE URGE TO PEE METER I have brought My offerings to Goddess' abode I have found peace Kittu still hasn't returned from Indoo's place. Yes. This means she is cooperating with him. I must say, Kittu is a lucky boy! You're right. He may return only in the morning. He'll have a fantastic night! In Goddess' abode Hail the Goddess Excuse me. Ma'am! Your son is nowhere to be seen. -At the prayer meet. -At the prayer meet. -Where is he? -Where is he? How long are you planning to sit here? You tell me. We could sit somewhere else as well. We need not necessarily sit here. I mean, how long do you plan to stay in my house? -I want to sleep. -Then, let's go to your bedroom. You can sleep while I… guard you. Why do you want to do that? Haven't you watched Jab We Met? A lone girl is looked upon as an open treasure box. I must protect you. THE URGE TO PEE METER Is Kartar in there? Please come in, Aunt. Welcome. I've been looking for you at the prayer meet, and are you here with a girl! Excuse me? What do you mean? I didn't invite him in. Of course! Aren't you a goody two shoes! I'm sure he didn't break the door and enter your house. You were the one who opened the door, right? Why are you mum? Tell your mother the truth! What will he say? Now I'll do the talking. I'll let everyone in the colony know that you are inviting boys over in your family's absence! Aunt, I'm being respectful towards you. But that doesn't mean you can keep talking nonsense. Listen, it's because of girls like you that other girls are seen in a bad light. Instead of getting married at marriageable age… you invite young boys over and take advantage of them. Oh, my God! The whole family is despicable. You've said enough. Now you will listen to me. The truth is, your son Kartar has been hitting on me since Alka's wedding. He said some things to my brother and barged into my house! I've been asking him to leave from here, but he just wouldn't budge! He says he will protect me. He told Mrs. Sharma, "Go to the prayer meet. I'm here to protect Indoo." Who gave him the responsibility to protect me? I'll smack this scoundrel so hard that he will land in prison! And if I'm proven right, I'll make him parade naked through the streets! Apologize to Indoo. Come on. Hey, Pran! Pran, let's go! I was offering my prayers to Goddess. Out! I said, get out of my house! If I see you anywhere around my house, I'll file a case against you! I have told you not to be in your father's company. You're growing up to be just like him! Do you have some work with me? No, dear. We heard that he was at your place-- So, we came here to teach him a lesson. -What did you come here for? -Uncle! If you touch me again, I'll disclose all your secrets to your wife. Have you lost your mind? Indoo, we just came here to tell you to be careful. -Let's go. -All hail the Goddess! -Dear-- -Let's go. Come on. Dear-- -Come on. -Take him away! THE URGE TO PEE METER What are you… Get down. I said, get down. Come on, get out of this room. Let me either go to the bathroom or-- What are you doing? I'm protecting myself. I'm not even going to touch you. I won't let you! What do you think I am? I'm a true Indian and an honest human being. Unlike your country, our country isn't filled with filth. Is there filth only in Pakistani? Dawood wasn't from India, right? Crows are always black, be it India or Pakistan. They are black in India for sure, but you guys must kidnap crows and turn them black. The parents in our country want their children to be IAS officers, doctors, engineers, scientists, etc. when they grow up. I'm sure that in your country parents celebrate the birth of a new Jihadi. They must be placing bets. The father must be saying, "My son will cause five blasts and 15 hijackings." And the mother must be saying that he'll do better-- What are you doing? I'm feeling hot. Put it over there! Your country has more terrorist camps than schools and colleges. Why did I come here? The urge to pee is so strong that my brain has stopped working. Please let me go to the bathroom! -Please-- -Just remain seated! Be quiet! All of you should be punished like this. You should all be made to sit in a line and not be allowed to pee. What harm have I caused you? Why are you so resentful? What's there to like about your country? Tell me one good thing about your country. -Go on. -Okay. Tell me. You've got nothing. Our historical cricket team. -We have such amazing-- -Cut the crap! We have players like Sachin, Dhoni and Sourav. Virat is also in form these days. We have Afridi, Wasim Akram and Imran Khan. By the way, film actresses of your country are crazy about our players. That doesn't mean your players are better than ours. You guys have lost every world cup match against us. India is far better than your country. Your country is no match for mine. You guys cannot tolerate that India is so far ahead of you. That's why you keep coming here to trouble us. I cannot hold it in anymore! Please tell me where the bathroom is, otherwise there will be a big problem. Good Lord! That must be the delivery boy. Please get the door. Stay here. Hurry up, or else I'll pee right here! Hurry! Hey! Put your feet down. Your order, ma'am. It's him. Just come with me to the bathroom. -Bathroom? -Yes, the bathroom. India, where's the washroom? Right there. The door to your left. -But, sir-- -Let's go! I'm not kidnapping you. Just keep an eye on me until I am done peeing. -I don't want to watch you pee! -Get in! Pick it up! You latecomer! You deliver the order late, and then you refuse to compensate! Just stand here and keep an eye on that Pakistani. Make sure he's just peeing and not doing anything else in there. Pakistani? Now you don't get started on it! What a disastrous night! I feel so much lighter now. But what happens when you watch a Pakistani pee? The woman thinks every Pakistani is a terrorist. She suspects that I'll use the excuse to pee to plant a bomb in her house. Anyone would suspect that! This is what you guys do. You go to hotels and start gunning down innocent people. Be it restaurants, railway stations, or hospitals, you guys spared no place! Why shouldn't we doubt you guys? What do you mean? How many times do I have to tell you I'm not a terrorist? Every thief claims to be innocent after committing a theft. Don't get me started on theft. You Indians are thieves. You guys steal our songs, make remixes and release them! You guys are frauds-- -Hey! -Hey! You guys plagiarize songs from all over the world! No country is ever perfect. You have to make it perfect. This is what has been said in the movie Rang De Basanti. -Didn't you watch it? -There you go! She uses a movie reference for everything. You mask your flaws with movie references! Your country isn't perfect either. India is still far better than Pakistan. Excuse me! India isn't better than Pakistan just because you claim so. Why do we need to compare them anyway? Every country has its advantages and disadvantages. If you think Pakistan is not a good country then, India isn't good either. Don't get me started on the increasing crime against women here. And religious warfare! All of you are frauds and you call yourselves "tolerant." Also, there are fights between states! The people of Mumbai have a problem with the people of Delhi. And some of them have a problem with the people of Bihar. -No-- -Shut up! And don't get me started about South India! One country has been divided into 25 mini countries. Get your facts right about your country before you criticize other countries. I can say a lot of things but I don't want to argue with you. You'll attack, I'll counter and he will also join in. -It will go on forever. -Fine. We won't say anything. Come on. Tell us. Which country is better? -India or Pakistan? -Who is he to judge? He is an Indian. And Indians judge everyone. No one is as judgmental as we are. I can see that. Stop grinning! Think about your answer while you keep an eye on him. -I'll be right back. -Where are you going? You kept whining about how badly you wanted to pee. I'm also a mere mortal who wishes to relieve herself. I'm a girl. I cannot express it so candidly. Keep an eye on him. I'll be right back. Hey, where did the Pakistani go? He left. What? Yes. Shit! I don't see anyone around. Well, good riddance! You too should leave now. Hold on! Let me check if anyone's out there. Wait. Mr. Bedi and his family are walking past the door. Yes, Sonal? Hey, Indoo. Is everything okay? It seems like it. What do you mean? Where's that Pakistani? He just left. Oh, good riddance! The other guy is still here. What? Who is that? You invited only one guy from Dinder. This is cheating. This guy is from Gomato and not Dinder. From Gomato? Do they supply men as well? I've been a fool all this while to be ordering just food from them. Listen, I'll talk to you later. Let me handle this situation first. Okay, bye. Have you brought me to Gurugram for just one round? Why are you snoring the night away? Hey, mister! This isn't a museum for you to take a tour. Let's see if the path is clear. Come on. Jagdish Kumar. Jagdish Kumar is on his way with your order. Done. Sir! Sir, wake up. Please wake up, sir! Who is it? Sir, there is a dead body over there. And I think the killer has entered that house over there. No. -But-- -Get me the evidence. And then report it to the police station. -Go. -Sir, you don't get it. India is in danger. India has been in danger since the time partition took place. Did you just realize that? Where are you from? I'm from Pakistan, sir. Why don't you understand? That girl named India is in danger, sir. Hey, stop calling it a girl! Show some respect. India… is our motherland. He's been trained well, sir. He'll rather die than talk. Then kill him. -We don't need him to talk. -What do you mean? IB has sent a picture of the other guy. Let me take a look, sir. Send his picture to all the police stations and news channels. We found his partner in this area. He must be somewhere close. -Glory be to the Goddess! -Glory be to the Goddess! -The one who rides the lion -Glory be to the Goddess! -The one who blesses all -Glory be to the Goddess! The one from the mountains Greetings, sir! -Say it with me -Hail the Goddess! -Glory be to the Goddess! -Glory be to the Goddess! Listen, sir. -That-- -Sing along! Glory be to the Goddess! Glory be to the Goddess! Glory be to the Goddess! Glory be to the Goddess! Wait. Let me check if there's anyone outside. You? Why did you come back? I won't let you insult my country and have the final say. I've come to give you a fitting reply. I don't want it. Please leave, or else my image will be tarnished. I won't leave. Let me in. Sure. That's the reason you have come back. You want to get in at any cost. But I'm not foolish! Do you understand? I won't let you in. Go away! Alright. I'll sit outside and tell all the passersby that you call boys over for one-night stands when your family's not home. Why do you want to ruin my life? What is it? Have your final say and get out of here. You get out of here. Why is he still here? Do you want to have a one-night stand with him? You have such a cheap mentality! He is an Indian. He isn't like you guys. He's here only to protect me from you. -Right, bro? -Yes, of course. Hey! Don't you get close to her. -Shut up! -Hear that? What's wrong with you? India, listen to me. I'm a Pakistani, but I'm not your enemy. I'm actually your friend. The real enemy is someone else. Excuse me! I understand English. Did you hear that? My country has progressed so much. He also knows English. Did you think he wouldn't understand if you talk in English? No matter how hard you try, I will not let your plan succeed. My plan? What plan do I have? You plan to mark your territory on the pretext of befriending me. What nonsense! Ms. India, you hold no special treasure. Everyone has the same goodies. Ridiculous. I was right about you guys. All boys are the same. I'm sure there's book that you guys read before you come down to earth. Don't worry, ma'am. I'll throw him out. -Come on! -Yes, do it! Who the hell are you to throw me out? Listen to me, India-- Don't act smart with me! You barged in here! You're the one who's uninvited. I know who you are. Understood? Oh, I see! You know who I am! Leave before I thrash you. -Will you hit me? -You… Stop it! Let him go. Are you both crazy? What are you doing? Why does this have to happen in my house? You'll break the mirror! Oh, shit! Is he dead? He's breathing. He's just unconscious. What have I done! You did the right thing, ma'am. This is what these Pakistanis deserve. Please help me out. I've had enough drama for the day. To hell with my image. Just take him along and dump him somewhere. You should leave now. I'll give you some cash. Take an auto rickshaw. Can I use the washroom before I leave? Yes, but make it quick. I'll be right back. Thank you. Look at this face carefully. He is a wanted terrorist. According to the police, he's hiding somewhere in Ghaziabad. The police force is looking for him all across the city. If you've seen him anywhere, call the police help line immediately. That's what you call a double whammy. I tried to be smart, but I've dug my own grave. What will I do now? We still don't know what he intends to do. But you should help the police in keeping your city and your country safe. The Ghaziabad police finally managed to get a picture of this dangerous terrorist. He is said to be hiding somewhere in Ghaziabad. Take a close look at his face. This innocent looking man, is in fact, very dangerous. According to the police, he could be hiding in a residential area. His partner has already been arrested. Ghaziabad police is interrogating him. -Look at the image shown on this-- -Thank you. And if you think he is-- Perhaps that idiot found out who I was. That's why he came back here to save you. But you Indians are big fools. You hit him in the head. I was looking for a place to hide, and you guys dragged me inside. I didn't even have to use my gun. Your order, ma'am. It's him. Just come with me to the bathroom. Bathroom? When you asked me to leave, he showed up just before I could take my gun out. You? Why did you come back? I won't let you insult my country and have the final say. I've come to give you a fitting reply. I ended up benefiting from your fight. This is nothing new. India and Pakistan have been fighting ever since the partition, and a third party always benefits from it. Forget about you two, my own guy betrayed me. He had set up a shop at Patel Nagar junction. He sold me out. He tricked me into coming to Ghaziabad-- Hey! Sir. We have searched almost everywhere. No one has seen him. We're yet to comb through Patel Nagar and Kavi Nagar. Let's go to Patel Nagar. There's where we caught Ibrahim. Baldev isn't interested in doing his job. He's forcing me to take his case. What case? His friend owns a hotel. His friend has lodged a complaint that his delivery guy went to deliver food, but didn't come back. The number with which that order was made is also switched off. It's not even been 24 hours since he went missing. What's the delivery area? Kavi Nagar. Sir, wait! Don't leave me behind, Sir! Listen up, girl! If you don't show yourself in the next ten seconds, I'll riddle this Pakistani's body with bullets. Show yourself! What kind of a person are you? You criticized him and yet he came back to save you. Now when I am about to shoot him, you are hiding inside! You should feel ashamed… you Indians! Bloody cowards. Who are you calling a coward? You are a coward. I come from the land of Bhagat Singh. I… I dare you to touch him. You bloody terrorist! I'll have you on your knees in no time. You guys are such emotional fools. He came back to save you, and you came out to save him. If you love each other so much, then, why do you keep fighting? Good job, India. Keep the gun pointed at him. I'll call the cops. You nitwit, that was my iPhone you just broke! Do you know how expensive it is? I'll shoot you! Do it. How will that help? You will get a bravery award at the most. And you'll be on the news for some time. Tell me something. Which family would let their son marry a murderer? Your country worships the wolves in sheep's clothing. I'll give you a better option. Shoot this Pakistani and I guarantee that I'll save you. Pakistanis are anyway a burden on this earth. India, he wants us to fight. Don't listen to him. I'll do something about this. Oh, really? Will you do something? Why did you come back when you got to know who he was? How could I leave you alone with him? You should have come back with some back up at least, you idiot! You should have informed the police. There's also a prayer meet going on. You could have asked for help over there. You are a Pakistani, not Salman Khan. I had gone to the prayer meet to seek help. I swear, your country is filled with idiots. And my phone is dead. I can't make a call. And the police of your country is simply useless. You act stupid and then you blame the police of my country! He is right. I should shoot you instead. India? This gun is the root cause of all the problems. This strange man with no proper identity is making two countries fight. We fight because of such people and such things. And the irony is that we are indeed fighting like fools. Just imagine, how would people fight or kill if there were no guns at all? India, this gun is the real problem here. Glory be to the Goddess! -Praise the Goddess who is truthful -Glory be to the Goddess! Be careful, Samar! Oh, Goddess! Our hearts are calling out to You Oh, Goddess! Our hearts are calling out to You Our hearts are calling out to You You are our support Oh, Goddess! Our hearts are calling out to You Oh, Goddess!

The Goddess who rides on a lion -Say it with love -Praise to thee, Goddess -Everyone together -Praise to thee, Goddess! -On top of your voices! -Praise to thee, Goddess! -Louder! -Praise to thee, Goddess! Glory be to the Goddess! -She mounts a lion -Glory be to the Goddess! -Oh, merciful one -Praise to thee, Goddess! -Oh, mountain dweller -Praise to thee, Goddess! Closer! You two have made my life miserable. Both of you need to die right now. Glory be to the Goddess! Glory be to the Goddess! -Glory be to the merciful Goddess! -Goddess! Chautala, take him away. Hey! Get up. Arrest him. Let's go. Make him sit. Cuff him up. Are you both alright? Yes, sir. I'm fine. He's one of the most wanted terrorists. Anyway, did anyone else in house get hurt? Sir, there was no one else at home. -Is this your house? -Yes, sir. Who are you? Sir, this is Samar. He's from Pakistan. We met on… we met online, sir. I invited him over. I am safe because he was here. Well, whenever an Indian and a Pakistani try to come closer, some idiot shows up and starts creating problems. I don't know why. Anyway, it's good to see the two countries together. Indoo! Indoo, what's wrong? Indoo! Police? What happened? -What happened? -What's wrong? -Police is here. -Indoo! What… what happened, Indoo? Are you alright, dear? Are you okay? -What happened? -Let me talk to her. No, let me talk to her first. Hang on a minute! Who are you guys? Her neighbors. What happened? I heard a gunshot. Everyone heard it. That's why we are here. You aren't the only one. The police and the adults are here. So, you need not be here. -You should go home. -Yes, son. Go home. He's here as well. Who? He's of my age. -How does that matter? -What do you mean? -Scold him. -Hang on! Introduce yourself, gentleman. I mean, who are you? Don't worry about him. I'll handle this. -But-- -He's technically her neighbor. Both the neighbors will help each other out. You may leave. -But we are here for her. -We will protect-- -Please leave! -We-- Get them out of here, Chautala. -But we are here for her. -Chautala! Go home and give rest to your old bones. -Your mom must be waiting. -Okay. -What is it? -It's nothing. -Ranjeet? -Yes? We've never seen this boy in the neighborhood, right? He looks like he's from Noida. Go home, guys. We're going. Do you need an invitation? Come on. Yes. I'll come back if I need more information, okay? I'll get going now. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you, sir. Are… are you alright? I'm so sorry. Please have a seat. I'll go and get first aid. Just a little more. Almost done. This is the last wound. Thanks. I'm the one who should be thanking you. You came back for me. You even got thrashed for me. What? I managed to hit him a couple of times. No, I didn't mean that. You gave him a tough fight. Tell me something. Did you know that something would go wrong or do you generally keep knives and red chili powder handy? Well, I had hidden those for you. For me? I mean, I had invited a stranger home. What if he turned out to be a bad guy? So… he turned out to a nice guy, right? Yes. He turned out to be a nice guy. And I also learned a lesson on what's right and what's wrong. Sorry for judging you. Today, I realized that no country is good or bad. It's the people who are good or bad. It is wrong to judge a book by its cover, no matter how fancy it is. It is wrong to hate someone without knowing them. Only those who believe in peace and not war, are right. Also, the ones who believe in love and not hate. And… do you believe in a kiss? Yes. But… your first kiss has to be very special. And you will always remember it. -And it-- -I know! And it should happen with someone special. Oh shit! Are my parents back? I'm sure those wretched men must have given them a call! That stupid terrorist broke my phone as well. Why did I call you here today? I've been facing a lot of trouble from the time you've come here. Why are you staring at me? Get out! This is how my first one-night stand story ends. But I have a lot to tell you. So, please fasten your seat belt. Indoo's next story is ready to take off. Let's go!
