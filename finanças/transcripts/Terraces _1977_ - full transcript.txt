Here comes our new neighbor. Oh? -She's got a piano. That means she's nice. -Uh-huh. -Julie! -Oh! Beth, Gregg! Hi! You finally did it! Congratulations. May you live happily ever after. That's the plan. Oh, listen, you guys. Thank you so much for getting me the apartment. All you owe us is your life. -See you later, Julie. -Oh, okay. Bye. -See you tonight. -All right, see you, Gregg. Bye. The whole building is having a meeting at 8:00. But I'll cancel if you could make it. I'll call you. What time? I want to be sure I'm in. I'll try to work it out. Can you hold the elevator, please? Eighth floor. Ripe with louses and credit complaints. I promise you, you'll love it here. The ambience is without a doubt... And the neighbors aren't too nosy. Just nosy enough. I mean, in case of burglars. You've had burglars? -Hasn't everybody? -Oh. Well, just once, actually. Fortunately, he was a first-timer. -And Roberta, that's 8D... -Uh-huh. ...caught him, in flagrante delicto. He ran like a thief. But why not? He was a thief. Well, Roberta in 8A was certainly lucky. Are you kidding? The burglar was lucky. Nobody messed around with Roberta and lives. It's open. Anyway, welcome. -Oh! Here. -I'm Alex Bengston. -How do you do? I'm Julie Bordon. -Hi. And... If you need a cup of scotch, feel free. I'm an actor, so I'm home a lot. You've got a deal. Okay, give me a ring. Okay. Here you are, miss. 555-2013. Thank you. Here you go. Sounds great. Thanks. ♪ Be it ever so humble ♪ There's no place like... Good bye, Mom. Wait, I'll be right down. We've already said good bye. I'll call you tonight. Julie, send the movers away. I'll pay them. Mom, please, live your own life. Let me grow up. Hello, Steve? Did I wake you? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought for sure you'd be out on the court giving a lesson. That's why I called. I mean, as long as I was sure you wouldn't be home, it was safe. It's Julie. Listen! I moved in. You're my first call. How would you like to be my first guest? I don't know why I'm whispering. This is my apartment! How would you like to come for dinner? Tonight. Terrific. 8:00. Terrace Towers, apartment 8B. Bye, Steve. My little goose. Oh! Berty. Oh, hi, neighbor. Hello! I'll be right over. Oh, listen, I'm still unpacking. - This is my husband, Martin. - Hello. And Blossom. Bread and salt. May you have peace, prosperity, and total happiness in your new home. Thank you very much. Now, back to your neighbors. Us, we're retired. Martin had Martin's Haberdashery on Beverly Boulevard for 31 years. Oh, I've seen that store. They still call it Martin's. That's how good he was. I was the brains. Twelve hours a day we worked. Well, I worked 12 hours a day. He got a lot of haircuts. Then, there's that lovely couple in 8A. She works for the movies and he's a big lawyer. Top notch people. Well, he's a public defender, and Beth writes publicity for one of the studios. You know them? They got me the apartment. Beth and I used to be roommates at UCLA. You and Beth? Yeah, I know. We're the odd couple. Well, that happens a lot with college roommates. You know, Beauty and the Beast. One gets all the dates and the other one takes all the messages. One's thin with that perfect tan and the other one's fat and blisters. Which one were you? Look, there's a tenants' meeting in my apartment tonight at 7:30. They're trying to get rid of Louis, the doorman, those Cossacks! "Cossacks"? The owners. I'll see you there. Listen, I'm not sure I can make it. I mean, I'm expecting someone for dinner. Aw, you're cute. It won't hurt Mr. Special to wait a minute. As the mayor of the building, I'll wait for you. In unity there is strength. I say we must stick together and tell the management where to go. Either Louis Parisi stays, or we don't pay the rent. Thank you. Thank you. Uh... My wife. Suppose they sue us? They got big lawyers. They may have the biggest, but we have the best. Our own Gregg Loomis. Who, as we all know, is one of the city's most fearless young lawyers. A regular Perry Mason. Oh! I'm available for any legal help. -Free, of course. -Oh! Of course. Anybody else? Yes, Chalane. I know Mr. Pearce, you know, he's the manager of the building. We're old friends. Right. Why not? What are old friends for? Roberta, you're heaven. You're out of order. One more time for Louis Parisi! Come over tomorrow, we'll play some Backgammon. Oh, I'd love it. Okay, when? What time? -11:00. -Okay. Chalane. Chalane. What a mess. Having fun? I love it! You want to come for dinner? We're having Lobster Newburg. Oh, that sounds so good. But I'm having company. -That's even better. -I know. -Goodnight. -I'll see you later. Bye, Gregg. Bye, Beth. Let's go for a nice walk, huh? Your Roberta is some woman. Oh, yes. We've been married 34 years. -And you just retired, isn't it? -That's right. -How do you like it? -Oh, I love it. Blossom and I, we take long walks, look around. It's a good life. Come on. -Shall we go? -Yeah. ♪ Hello. Hello? Hi. Wanna hit the sack? In a while. Blossom! Blossom! What are you doing? Running out into the street like that, you stupid dog! You know what first attracted me to you? I'm afraid to ask. You make me laugh. You're the only one who makes me laugh. Okay, I'll settle for that. You know, Alex, before I met you, I don't think I had smiled in 25 years. Not since before medical school. I don't mean to be pushy, but... My alleged wit. Is it enough? I don't know. My God, I can't even believe this has happened. Never happened before? Never. My life has been totally unreal since I've met you. So has mine. Yes, but you've... Always... Been, um... Gay? It's all right. I don't mind. It's like telling a black man he's always been black. He never notices unless someone reminds him. -Alex, I'm sorry. -Hey... Don't feel bad. I told you. I feel just as unreal as you do. Only, my unreality is, that I am finally happy. As a kid, I ran from foster home to foster home. Then job to job, then bed to bed. I'm glad to stop all that. I'm looking for Dr. Cabe. Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, but there's no Dr. Cabe in this building. Well, I know that he is... He doesn't live here. He visits, quite often. A patient? Oh. Do you know the name of the patient? No, I don't. But it's very important. It's... It's urgent. An emergency. I must reach the doctor. It's urgent. Look, he... He's very distinguished-looking. Tall, he drives a brown Lincoln... Well, there... There aren't that many men who are distinguished-looking, and tall and... Drive a... Look, please, it's very important. Well... Uh, thank you, anyway. If you happen to remember who his patient is, would you tell her that Dr. Cabe's wife was looking for her? I know I'm a little late. Three hours, 46 minutes and 12 seconds. You see, I was giving a late lesson at the court, and the lights went out and I had to hang around for them to turn the power back on, and... Hey, I'm a louse, but I love you. Steve, what do you think of the place? Yeah, it's great. Wanna move in? Just kidding! Just kidding. Hey, Julie, I've got to get on now. You just got here. Yeah, I know, but I got a tennis lesson in the morning. Well, I've got lessons too, with 35 kids. Yeah, but you're not running around the tennis court with 'em. -Steve. -Yeah? Stay all night. Why do I say things like that? Women are always pleading with men to stay all night. I think it's just sickening! Hey, Julie, don't do that. -What? -You're open, you're free. It's the best thing about you. Yeah, why does it always get me into trouble? Why can't I be cool, like Beth? Cool girls are a dime a dozen. I like you just the way you are. Next time I'll stay, I promise. Tonight! Stay tonight, please. It's my first night in my first apartment. This is your first apartment? You mean, you've always lived with your mother? Don't rub it in. Steve, stay. I'm scared. I don't want to be alone. I don't even know who my neighbors are. They could be rapists, killers, dopers. Come on, five days a week you're teaching rapists, killers and dopers. They're not all like that. Some of my kids are very sweet. Well, that's because you bring it out in them. You bring out the best in all of us. How does it feel to be the beautiful half of a couple? You tell me, how does it feel? Steve, you could have anybody. You probably do, all the time. You give me too much credit. I'll call you. Steve, let me just ask one thing. Why do you bother with me? Now, what kind of question is that? You're cute, you're smart, you're funny. Yes, but I've seen some of your tennis students. They're gorgeous, like they were carved out of marble. To the marble girls, I'm just another jock. With you, I feel special. You mean, because... I make... I make you happy? No. Because I make you happy. Okay, five more minutes. You scared me. What time is it? Around 1:00. I couldn't sleep. I've got to finish this interview with Al Pacino. Pacino? A-ha! That's rough competition. No wonder I've been striking out lately. I've never even met him. You never met him? How can you write an interview with him? I've got his bio. All the facts. I know what questions to ask him. What about his answers? He doesn't have to worry. I'll make him sound brilliant. And the public buys the whole package and it's another consumer rip-off. Gregg, we are talking about a movie star, not a toothpaste. Same principle. Feed the public a diet of pap, tell them enough interesting lies, and soon they'll forget there's such a thing as truth. Thank you, Father Loomis, for that inspiring sermon. I brought you a peace offering. Peanut butter and crackers. We've been married for three years. -I still don't eat in bed. -Hmm. -You don't know what you're missing. -Yes, I do. A bed full of crumbs and heartburn. Beth, why can't we talk? You don't talk, you lecture. That's because it takes one to lecture. It takes two to talk. Okay. What happened to us? We used to be so alike. You mean, before I went to work and became unprincipled and corrupt and rotten? Oh, Beth. I grew up, that's what happened. Why does everybody equate selling out with growing up? We can't all be reformers, Gregg. We can't all devote our lives to protecting the poor and oppressed. Only the chosen can do that. You once agreed with that goal. You thought it was terrific to be a public defender. That was when we were in college. It was five years ago! We were together in everything then. We marched for peace together, fought the police together. That was then. People grow apart. But it's usually after 30 years of marriage. After three, it's... It's ludicrous. Maybe we're early bloomers. -Aren't you coming to bed? -What for? I'm sorry, that was a cheap shot. Gregg, everybody fights sometimes. You're still my best friend. You are so beautiful. Roberta. I stopped in front of the store today. You should see the windows, like a dirty movie. Obscene dummies. And no stock hardly. The customer couldn't tell what they're selling. - Roberta? - Yeah. And Blossom was such a bad dog today. You know, you stupid dog, you could've been killed. Suppose a car had come out into the street, you could've been run over. Roberta. Tell Blossom what a bad dog she is. Will you stop it with that dog? You're driving me crazy with that dog! Roberta! Our son, Nicky, is not coming and you're making love to a dog. Nicky didn't say for sure. Maybe he'll come. He's not coming. He doesn't want to see us. So we'll go see him in Cleveland. We get on a plane, four hours later, we're there. Blossom loves flying, don't you, sweetheart? We are not invited to Cleveland. Who has to be invited? He's our son. And that Judy. Who could ask for a better daughter-in-law? Her name is Jane. Jane, Judy. But that dog's name you don't forget, right? Roberta, what's upsetting you? We are not wanted. Will you listen? I always listen. For 34 years, I've been listening to you. You listen, but you don't hear. Your own child doesn't want to see you. Roberta, what's bothering you? We saw them last summer. We'll see them again. They're not running away. They have run away. You listen, but you don't hear. All right. What do you want me to hear? The truth. And what's the truth? The truth is, from now on, it's just you and me. I remember a time when it was just you and me. No kids, just you and me. Nine months, that's how long it was, just you and me. Rob, was that so bad? Is it so bad now? We're retired, we have a terrific life, a great apartment. We can take a trip. Blossom loves traveling. -I am going to throw that dog off the terrace! -Roberta! -Get her out of here! -All right. Sweetheart. Go to sleep. It was a bad day. My patient had a seizure in the middle of the operation. It's been a little rough. Roger, the day's over now. You can relax. I've got to go. -Aren't you going to finish your food? -Ah, I can't. When do I see you again? It's hard for me to get away. Oh, for the good old days when doctors made house calls. Thanks for being so understanding. I try to brighten each corner. -Goodnight. -Roger. Call me. So... How's your life, darling? -Couldn't be better. -Aw! Well, the good doctor must be giving you a lot of love. I'm the one who gives the love. He gives something better. Diamonds? Meaning. He gives my life meaning. Oh. I'm for meaning. Whatever turns you on. I'm beginning to feel... Like a person. Instead of? Instead of a flake, I guess. I feel solid. I feel so solid, I'm liable to turn straight. You mean that? Of course not. -God forbid. -Mmm. Everybody needs someone. Like me and Harold. Do you know how long I've known Harold? Twenty years. You met him in first grade? The day I met Harold, I said to myself, "Chalane, now there's a man you could settle down with." How is Harold? I haven't seen him for a month. Hmm. He's fine. He's kind of busy. He's back east with his wife, visiting her relatives. They'll be back Tuesday. Hi, neighbors. Roberta, what are you doing on Julie's terrace? I'm watering her plants for her. Hey, don't forget about the meeting tonight. I'll be there with bells on. Wear what you want. A tenants' meeting. What a way to spend Saturday night. Honey, with people like us, it's the name of the game. The name of the game is backgammon. And I double. This quiche is fabulous. Mmm-hmm. - Finish it, Julie. Oh, I can't. I've had three pieces already. Well, tomorrow, I'll fast. So, how's teaching? It's frustrating. You know what the biggest problem of delinquency is? Boredom. These kids have absolutely nothing to do with their time. The state would rather pay to keep them in jail, than to spend any money to teach them how to stay out. Why don't you quit? Both of you. You admit you can't do any good. The pay is lousy. Dump. She's right. She's always right. Well, you've got the life, Beth. Lunch with Robert Redford, cocktails with James Caan. Well, now there's a job I'd never get sick of. You have to be a little sick to get into it. Is it sick to make a decent living? Depends on why you do it. Well, let's just say I do it so that you can afford to save the world. There's something wrong when you get twice the money I do for telling the world that Paul Newman washes his eyes with ice water. I admit that is less noble than bailing out pickpockets. That's not what I do, and you know it. Hey, listen! I didn't tell you about this time, you know, recently I was on the bus, and there was this pickpocket that started to come on to me, only I thought he was coming on to my incredible body. And I started to help him! I think I love you. No, it's just my incredible body. Listen, Beth, we're supposed to help Roberta with the refreshments for the meeting tonight. Oh, right, before I forget, I've got your tickets for the Linda Ronstadt concert. You want me to hold on to them for you? No, I won't lose them. Here. -Steve coming? -He'd better. You mean you're not sure? Sure, I'm sure. I was just kidding. No, you weren't. He's the world's most unreliable man. I don't know why you put up with him. Why did Barbra Streisand put up with Kris Kristofferson? Why did Cleopatra put up with that dummy, Anthony? Why? Chemistry. You just like guys you can't get. That's not true. Really, Steve's a terrific guy. Really! I mean the last time we were together, we actually communicated. Forget it. Thanks for the lunch, it was sensational. I'll see you guys later. Bye. -That was not nice. -It certainly wasn't. I mean telling Julie she goes for guys she can't get? Ugh! It happens to be the truth. You didn't think I meant you and her, did you? Now that's funny. Well, I did know her first. In college. You had two nothing dates. They were nothing to you! Julie may not agree. You actually believe that? Oh, why not? People believe what they need to believe. I need to believe that you and I are going to make it. Am I kidding myself? ♪ May I help you? I'm looking for 8B. You were going in the right direction. It's that one. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Chalane, get that please. I'll be right out. Hi. Shall I begin again? Hi. I'm Dorothea Cabe. Oh, my dear God. And you, uh... May I... May I come in? I think you've got the wrong apartment. I don't think so. This is 8B. Yes, may I help you? I... I don't think so. I'm looking for the person who lives in 8B. Yeah, that's me. You live here? Yes. I'm Dorothea Cabe. You? You and my husband? I don't believe it. Oh, my! Blossom, don't look. Just... Just put that on. Mr. Robbins, what a pleasure! Listen, Mr. Vogel, it's your store now... That's right. Well, let me give you some advice. I know this neighborhood, I know these people, I know my customers. That filth in the window. They... They don't like it. Get rid of it. Well, we're doing very well. These customers... There's... There's not a face I recognize. We're after a different trade. Then why do you still call it Martin's? I'm beginning to wonder myself. Will you excuse me? Filth! People don't come in a haberdashery, they don't want filth. Oh, by the way, Julie, I forgot to tell you. Guess who dropped in on me yesterday. -My mother. -Right, your mother. -How did you know? -My mother? Wonderful woman. What did she want? What does any mother want? Her daughter's security. You should get married. Why? What's the matter, darling? Nothing's the matter. I just asked a legitimate question. Why get married? It settles things. Roberta, how long have you been married? August 4, 34 years. Thirty four years? Can you believe it? To the same man. Well, do you still talk to each other? Once in a while. Do you still have sex? Beth! What's wrong with that question? This isn't the Middle Ages. Well, there's a lot to be said for the Middle Ages. Women have lied to each other for so long, they don't know what they're supposed to feel. In my day, we knew what we were supposed to feel. We were supposed to make our husbands happy. What about you? Did Martin make you happy? Beth, cut it out. You're a smart girl. You ought to know. Men are men. You let them believe what they want to believe. And you'll have a husband. You girls like sex? -Sometimes. -Always. I think I'm some kind of freak or something. You feel so terrific from sex, I feel terrific from a corned beef sandwich. They're good, too. This is some conversation to be having while we're fixing hors d'oeuvres. The system is foolproof. The caller presses the buzzer. And you go to the microphone which will be installed in your apartments and ask for identification. And is the buzzer going to help us with our packages when we come home from the market? Mrs. Robbins, there's nothing in our rental agreement which specifies the management will provide such a service. Well, it's clear that you never lived in an apartment house. Really! It is understood, Mr. Parisi stays. Right, Mr. Parisi? Don't buzzer us! No Mr. Parisi, no rent. Can we talk? I was waiting to hear from you. -Would you like a drink? -No. What did you say to her? Nothing. She just introduced herself and left. And walked away. She couldn't believe it, huh? It doesn't matter what she believes. It's what we believe. Hey, Roger. Hey, I make you laugh, remember? I heard a funny one today. This grasshopper goes into a bar... I came to say goodbye. And... The bartender says, "We've got a drink named after you." Will you please listen to me? And the grasshopper says, "Herman?" I can't handle it. -Goodbye, Alex. -Roger, please! I can't handle it, I'm sorry. Roger, please, we'll see each other less often. I won't make any demands. Please, don't make me run again! Don't make this any tougher than it is. No wonder she was laughing. She knew she couldn't lose. Hi, have you seen Alex? Not since the meeting. His friend showed up and they went out into the hall. I know, I know. Uh, we were going to the movies, and... Well, maybe his friend... I mean, maybe they're unavailable. No, no, he would've told me. Listen, your terrace is next to his. Can I take a peek? Sure. Your place is darling. It's coming along. That's too drab. That's too much pattern. Now, that... ...is for Saturday night! Alex. Alex? Steve likes me in white. Oh, well, men go for that virginal look. As long as you're not a virgin. What's the occasion? We're going to a concert with Beth and Gregg. You look like a nurse. I think what you need is some color. Here, have a blue scarf. -Thanks, Chalane. -Don't mention it. -Have you seen my wallet? -Nope. Listen, when we're out tonight with Julie and Steve, no fights, okay? Of course. Why do you think you have to tell me that? Well, this morning when we had that argument in front of her, I was very embarrassed. Are you telling me it's my fault? Forget that question. Help me find my wallet. And try to remember I'm there, okay? Whenever we get together, it's like you two have some kind of a private joke. Don't be silly. Don't tell me not to be silly. It's infuriating. Okay, don't be dumb! Is that better? Will you help me find my wallet? Forget your wallet. There's nothing in it. Beth, what's bugging you? I'm just sick of your opinion of yourself. What does that mean? You think you're a saint because you spend your life bailing junkies out of jail. You don't know what I do. You're not interested. Maybe Julie's interested. She's another saint. All you do-gooders are saints. Beth. Me, I just work for a living. You call that garbage you write "work"? Beth. Beth. Beth, how did we reach this point? Five minutes ago I was getting dressed, minding my own business. You know where a boy saint belongs? With a girl saint. Have fun, you and Julie. Beth! Oh, hold on, Mother. The doorbell. I don't know who it is. That's why I'm gonna go to the door, open it and see who's on the other side. Just... Just a sec... Come on in, I'm on the phone! Come on in. It's the mad rapist of 10th Street, but he promised to wait until I finish my phone call. Listen, Mother, he's getting impatient. I'll talk to you later, okay? Okay, bye. You don't know of some elderly gentleman of great wealth, and absolutely no passion, who'd be interested in... What's the matter with you? We won't be going with you tonight. Beth walked out. Oh, I'm sorry. It wasn't because of me, was it? No, no! Why do you think... Well, you guys had a fight this morning when I was at your house, and another one now, just before the three of us... Boy, are you guilty. Oh, I know. It's an old habit. It started the morning I was delivered from my momma's womb. The pain I gave her! She was just on the phone reminding me. What is it with you guys? The longer we know each other, the less we know each other. What do you mean, "that's all there is to it"? This is your mother you're talking to. At least you can give me an explanation. Busy is no explanation. It's an excuse. Who's yelling? I'm just speaking so you'll hear. You're in Cleveland. Hmm. No. Everybody's got problems. You've noticed that. Steve's not coming... He'll be here, he'll be here! You've got the best toys. I... I guess I'd better be going. Oh, no, I promise, he'll be here. Steve will come. -No, no, no... -Please don't... I've got champagne! Okay. Oh, Nicky, please. No, I can't bring your father to the phone. He's out. Where? With that dog, where else? He thinks more of that mutt than he does of me. The happiest day of my life will be the day I go to that dog's funeral. Stay. Blossom! I like champagne. -It is a fine beverage. -Mmm. I wonder how champagne got its name. - You? - Mmm. A Frenchman named Sam got a terrible pain. - And nothing could help him. And then, he took a sip of fermented grape juice, and Sam was saved. And ever since then, it's been called "champagne". Why didn't they call it "Sam Pain"? Would you pay 10 bucks a bottle for something called "Sam Pain"? He's not coming. Well, maybe he got mugged. Sure. No, no, no, it's true. You know what Los Angeles is in crime? Number eight in the country. You know what I say? I say, if you can't be number one, forget it. - It's empty. - Oh, I got another one. -Mmm. -Help me. Don't feel bad. Oh, I feel great. That rat. Thanks for letting me come over. Thanks for coming over. You know, I don't get it about you two. I remember... In English Lit, you guys were always the golden couple. And I remember they used to call you and Beth Scott and Zelda. Look what happened to them. Bad example, sorry. It's all your fault. What'd I do now? That night. What night? That night seven years ago, when you took me home to see if your roommate approved of me. Ah! Huh. Boy, did she approve of you. Whole life would've been different. To the good old days. In the good old days, I weighed 170 pounds. You got pretty. I had a mustache. I'm thinking of growing it back. What do you think? You're pretty, Julie, why don't you believe it? Oh, I'll believe anything. Ask Steve. Julie. Not worth it. Forget Steve. Who? Good girl. So what if he didn't show up? Don't cry. Well, at least he could've called! I mean... Even my mother called. And called and called and called... You kiss good. Come on. Listen, I'll make you a deal. I'll believe I'm pretty, if you believe you kiss good. Beth was my roommate. Beth is my roommate. Uh, Beth is a terrific person. I mean, she's honest, she's organized... Is she organized. She organized this. Hello? Hello, Alex? Alex? Hello? Hello? Alex! Mr. Robbins? What happened? To me... Nothing happened. But my beautiful Blossom. Oh, is she... Expired. Oh, Mr. Robbins, I'm so sorry. Come on. Let's go inside. But we had this date to go to the movies. I don't know what happened. He would've called me if he changed his mind. He never would've stood me up. I know something is wrong, or he would've called me. Come on. Key doesn't work, dammit. Alex! Alex! What's the matter, doctor? I think Mr. Bengston's in some kind of trouble. He doesn't answer the door? To you? Are you sure he's in there? I think so. I telephoned, but it was off the hook. I woke up this morning and I had these terrible vibrations. I knew everything was going to be wrong because I had... Chalane, you're babbling! Well, the door is locked from the inside. I know he's there, I know it. -Alex! -Of course, it's the dead bolt. You had a fight, you two? Now, just remember what I told you. She lived a rich, full life. And she has you to thank for it. Dear God, he's been mugged! I wasn't mugged. Look, Blossom is dead. She scratched you and died? Get in the house. I'll be right back. That man and that dog. What's happening? We're having another meeting? - Alex and the doc had a fight. Please. Well, they had a fight and maybe Alex did something terrible. - Alex! - We can't get in. -We better call the cops! -No, no, don't! -Well, maybe he's alive! -Of course he's alive. Alex! Well, Julie's terrace is right next to Alex's. -Come on. -Oh! Let's do that. Gregg, wake up. I think somebody's at the door. But what if it's Beth? Don't come out. We've got to use your terrace. It's Alex. -What is it? -It's Alex. We're not sure, but... It's not him! -Listen. Okay, wait. Listen to me. -All right. All right. We went to the concert. It rained. -Your clothes got very wet. -Forget it. -I brought them home... -Forget it, forget it. Forget it. What's going on? It's something about Alex. I'm afraid of heights. -I think I can climb around this. -Wait a second. Don't look down! I can't do it. There must be some way to get to the other terrace. Julie, get a ladder! - Roberta has one! - Yeah, hurry! Of all people for this to happen to. The sweetest, gentlest man. He never did anybody any harm. Get that dog off my couch. Roberta, she's dead. We'll celebrate later. Off! I don't believe you. So, what happened? She... She ran into the street. There was a taxi. It wasn't the driver's fault. Roberta, your door was open! I didn't mean to rush in like this, but we need a ladder. An eight-story ladder? A ladder, please, Roberta! Blossom, my poor little baby. Be quiet, the man next door may be dying and you're worrying about an animal. Oh, Mr. Robbins, Blossom is... She's gone. After 15 years. Oh, God. Every year in a dog's life is supposed to equal seven years of a... Of a human's. She was 105. She didn't look it. Not to me. Oh, Mr. Robbins, I'm sorry. Okay, Julie, I've got the ladder. Come on, let's go. - Can I help? - Here's the ladder. Here, I'll take it. Hurry up! Bring it, I'll hook it. Hurry up. I'll hold you, don't worry. -Slowly, slowly. -All right. Oh! Oh! Now, is that gonna support you? It's not gonna work around the side. All right, I'll hold on to you. Gregg, be careful. I can't look. Tell me what's happening. I got you, I got you. Go get Alex. Come on! -You all right? -I'm okay. Alex. Oh, Alex. Alex! - Hurry up. - Gregg. - Come on, Gregg, open up. - Open up the door. Is he all right? Oh, my God! He's all right, tell me he's all right. Oh. Get some hot coffee. Come on, give me a hand. Come on. Right, into the bathroom. Why are you taking him to the bathroom? To make him throw up. Oh, you should take him to my bathroom. It'd make anybody... -Where is he? -In the bathroom. You didn't have time to get dressed? - Beth... - Excuse us. All right. All right. Now easy does it. Look at him, he looks worse than Blossom. Coffee. That's a boy, now drink some more. - Drink some more, that's it. - Keep... Come on, keep drinking. That's fine. My baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need my beauty sleep. Harold's coming back Tuesday. I'd better go check on the corpse. Beth. I... I'll get the rest of my clothes. Beth, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. We didn't go to the concert. Steve didn't show up. He didn't even call. We started drinking champagne, and the next thing we knew... Don't blame Gregg. It's me. Me, me and my rotten impulsiveness. You know me when I start drinking champagne. Act now, think later! He didn't have a chance. He loves you. And I love you too. Beth! Please, let it be yesterday. What did she say? Nothing. But I think she suspects. Jesus. Julie... Make it go away. I'm... I'm sorry this happened to you. But I'm not sorry it happened. Thought you'd be packing. Why should I be? This is my apartment. -Beth, about tonight... -I know what you did tonight. Would you like to know what I did? Yeah, sure. I took a long walk. I did a lot of thinking. Would you like to know what I thought? -Okay. -I thought, "We lived together for two years. "We've been married for three. "So we had a rotten year. "Four out of five isn't bad." My wife, the computer. And then the computer thought, "Maybe it's time to get back to the marriage. "Maybe even have a child." Your timing is obscene. Then I thought, "Maybe this baby would be lucky. "Maybe it would have my looks and your brains." And then I thought, "Suppose it's the other way around?" I laughed too, me, the lady with no sense of humor. I stood out there all alone in the street, and I made myself laugh. Beth, I just slept with another woman. Drop that crazy control of yours. Do something, hit me, throw something, be mad! I am mad, Gregg. And I'm hurt and humiliated, and feeling all the things I'm supposed to feel. -Except one. -What's that? I'm not ready to leave you. Before tonight, you were ready. Now that you've got a legitimate reason, you suddenly can't stand to lose me. Infidelity! That's supposed to be the biggie, isn't it? The final shot that blows the marriage all to hell. For most people, it is. What would you say if I told you I didn't really blame you? I'd kill you. Now who's being middle-class? You're tough, Beth. Really tough. Good tough or bad tough? Tough, tough like fine china. What fire doesn't destroy, it hardens. Don't count on it. Beth, you're crying? I've never seen you cry. ♪ Where is Mr. Martin Robbins? What do you want him for? Can we see him please? Oh, you've got the wrong apartment. The action's in 8B. You missed it, of course. -Mr. Robbins? -Shh! Mr. Robbins, did you smash a window over on Beverly Boulevard a couple of hours ago? Are you crazy? Smash a window? That's all my husband has to do, is smash windows? You were identified at Martin's Haberdashery. Oh, we sold that over a year ago... It's me. I did it. You did it? What did you do? You did what? The trashcan. I threw the trashcan through the window. That's when Blossom ran out into the street. Oh, Martin. You broke the window? Why? Oh, Martin. Martin. Mom? Julie! Who else calls you "Mom"? Nothing's wrong. I just felt like talking to you. Yeah, I know what time it is. It's... Yeah, it's half past 1:00. All right, look, I'll call you tomorrow. Nothing's wrong. I just felt like calling you. I... I got some plants. Yeah. Oh, and I got my piano tuned. And I... I went to bed with Gregg Loomis. Yeah. It's Beth's husband. Mom, will you stop laughing? All right, just hold on, Mother, a minute, okay? There's somebody at the door. Hi, gorgeous. Goodbye, gorgeous. Hey. Hi. Yeah, it was the mad rapist of 10th Street, the one that's always trying to mug me. Yeah, I told him to get lost. I miss you too, Mom. I'll call you tomorrow. Good night. Hey, Mr. Robbins, I love that new puppy of yours. It's real cute. A beauty, huh? She's a gift from my wife. Call me stupid. What are you going to call the little doggie? What else? Blossom II. Gorgeous day. I'm fed up of gorgeous days. I'd give my soul for one day of New York slush. -Hey. -Hi. Hi, how's it going? Terrific. Let's have dinner. Sure. -Moving in? -Mmm-hmm. You're leaving the wife and kids? I hope we'll be good neighbors. Hi, Roberta. I want to tell you something. People today... Just a dumb building. Harold! Oh, Harold.
