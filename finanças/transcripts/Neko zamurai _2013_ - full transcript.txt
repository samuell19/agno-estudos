It's morning-- Right... She's not here anymore. Come on now. It's just a cat that's gone. "Because of that cat, I've been talking to myself pretty much lately." "Wonder if she's well..." "T-The hell!" Still... Tamanojo-chan's a cutie pie, choo-choo-choo! Sweetypoo? Coochiepoochiepoo? Master! Here's some superb sushi. Oh... Come bring it here. Yes! Alright... Here you go. Tama-chan, eat well. Look. What's the matter? It's your favorite, isn't it? - See? It's quite tasty. - Right... Why are you eating it? You! Right? Oh, Tama-chan... Tamanojo? Tamanojo? (Neko Chaya) "It's not because I miss Tamanojo." "Right." "It's the jelly snack." "I wanted to eat the jelly snack." Are you going to order the usual? The jelly snack. You mean the "Jelly Meow", right? Jelly! Our shop uses puns about cats, so it's "Jelly Meow". Jelly! "The Way of the Samurai never does such a thing!" If you do not make a proper order, we cannot respond to your request. Jelly--! ...Meow. - Very well, sir! - "I lost!" - Also... You can choose the cat that you like... "I've come to eat jelly!" Which kind do you like? A white cat. You got it! Here you go, this is Kaori-chan! Purr-lease take care of her! "It's not a white cat." "Seems not the same..." You're so cute~! You're so adorable, you god of mischief... I could eat you up... "I saw that..." Oh! What's up? Do you want to help me? Thank you! Here you go. You're really skillful with that, huh. If you want work cutting firewood, I still have some more. I'm still looking for an opening for a Samurai's position. You still haven't given up on that? "Nasty woman." You're not returning to your homeland? I cannot yet go back. Say... Don't think of complicated stuff. When the sun rises, you work hard... When the sun sets, you go home and sleep. I think that life is a daily repetition of such routine. I wonder if there's nothing more or less to it than that. There are many things more important than work, you know. Tamanojo... Tamanojo! What happened? You mustn't come here! Tamanojo... It is I. I'm coming in. Did you abandon the match for the sake of the cat? That's right. Let's have a match once again. Someday I'm going to beat you... That's the only thing I think about. If you were serious and have shown up at that time... ...I might have lost to you. With the way things are... let's finally settle it! If you won't fight me... Even if you don't want to, draw your sword! Draw your sword! Make her shut up! A cat mews when it wants. This is absurd. I can't do this. It can't be helped if the one you wish to fight won't fight back... My goodness... What happened to you... I have changed... Because of this cat. Seems that cat has captured your heart. You do as you please, right? Both you and the cat. Farewell... ...Neko Zamurai. "Neko Zamurai." "Neko Zamurai." Thank you. Just a bit more, then I'll return you to Kagaya. Before that, I'll just give you a bath. Madarame-sama. It's Sakichi of Kagaya. Door's open. Come in. I thought that my cat had come and bothered you. She must have made you worry. Come now, Tamanojo... They've come to pick you up. Tamanojo cannot be tied down by anyone. Cats live their lives freely, and rightly so. When she wants to come here... ...or to my home... ...I think she will be well-loved. So... If you do not mind... ...please... ...take care of Tamanojo. I am grateful. Come one, come all! Imported DoNyat Bars! It tastes meow-tastic! Tama-chan! She has gotten livelier. I'll buy two. Alright! Today's a celebration! So I'll give it to you for free! But... Eat a lot, and work hard. You must earn money, right? You mustn't let Tama-chan go hungry. Purrr~haps you're right. Oh! Tama-chaaan! Please look after her today. You're welcome anytime... Just make sure you can pay, alright? And also... Why, thank you! It's delicious! Eh, you're charging me? I'm joking. So you can make a joke, huh? With that face. Things worked out well, right? Also... you both are able to be together. Oh, well. Don't get separated from your family, alright? Oh, a cat? It IS a cat. Dear, there's a cat! Come, look at the cat! What is the fuss about? What is its name? Tamanojo. Tamanojo, huh? Tama-chan! Tama-chan! She's so cute! Really cute! "Kyutaro-sama..." "Are you doing well?" "All is well at home." "Oharu is also very energetic." "A few days ago, she was able to defeat in an argument some boorish boys." "I praised her, saying, 'As expected of the daughter of Madarame Kyutaro!'." (Father) "Shizu..." "Haru..." "Before anything else, I am fine." "Looking for work had taken a longer time than expected." "But I will not give up." "I promise... to send you good news in the future." For Oharu-chan... You have a letter too. "It took me a while to get used to living alone..." "But right now..." That's it, that's it... "By some strange turn of events..." "I am living with a cat named Tamanojo." "It wasn't so bad." "It's gotten cramped inside my room but..." "I'm sure if you meet her, she will make a good friend for Haru to play with." Don't move! "How about..." "...coming over to Edo one of these days?" Mother... Here's the cat. "I am the former swordplay mentor from Kaga domain." "The name is Madarame Kyutaro." "I am a master of the Muso Sword Technique." "The nickname given to me by someone..." "...is 'Neko Zamurai'." "Living in Edo..." "Though there's no money nor job..." "I nap in a sunny spot..." "Ah, purrr~fect weather!"
