NIGHT OF THE ASSASSINS "And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them... ...because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters." "And he said, I will hide my face from them. "I will see what their end shall be, for they are a forward generation... ...children in whom is no faith." "They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God... ...they have provoked me to anger with their vanities... ...and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people." "I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation." "For a fire is kindled in mine anger... ...and shall burn unto the lowest hell... ...and shall consume the earth with her increase... ...and set on fire the foundations of the mountains." "I will heap mischief upon them." "I will spend mine arrows upon them." "They shall be burnt with hunger... ...and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction" Rufus! Hasn't the Lady returned yet? No, sir, what with this rain and the storm. The same as the past 20 nights. She must be at a charity meeting. They're organising a charity ball. And my niece? She went to bed long since. The lazy little... Will there be anything else, sir? No. You can run along to hide behind your wife's skirts. I know you're frightened of the thunder. Thank you very much, sir. God of storms, Lord God of Heaven and Earth, as you manifest your holy wrath, so manifest your goodness and mercy. I beg of you. I'm back. Go to bed. I'll join you shortly. Lord, deliver us from this misery. "Look for a folded page in The Book of the Apocalypse. "There you will find the key to your death." "Standing atop the stony heights, with rooks, ravens and scavenging beasts all around me, and contemplating the raging fire spread ever further by the wind, and which the rain endeavoured to extinguish, I was consoled by the thought of how the Lord makes all men equal, showing unto them all, regardless of class or race, the four elements by him created. Earth to bury us. Wind to scourge us. Water to drown us. Fire to burn us." Who's there? EARTH TO BURY US WIND TO SCOURGE US WATER TO DROWN US FIRE TO BURN US Thank you very much. Good night. Good night, Cecilia. Archibald! Are you there? Archibald? Rita! Rita! Wake up! Wake up! What is it, Aunt? Do you know where Lord Archibald is? No. Why? I can't find him. It's very odd. Ask Rufus. He was with him when I came to bed. Archibald! Archibald! Good morning, Inspector. Good morning, Doctor. You arrived in time. Poor sir. Covered in dirt. -Covered in dirt. Poor sir. -Come away, Rufus. Come on, don't go over there. A filthy crime. -Death by suffocation. -He was buried alive, eh? I'll do an autopsy later. I believe he was knocked out first, then buried while he was still unconscious. He has injuries on his wrists and ankles. He must have tried to get the handcuffs off. -Do you suspect anybody? -No. A madman? -Or revenge. -Revenge of a madman, then. Come now, Aunt, there's nothing to be done about it now. He was your father. You don't seem to care very much. I do, but what's the use of crying? I'd rather help you. That's very kind of you, especially in light of the fact that I never accepted you as a daughter. That's not unusual. It never surprised me. My mother was only one of Lord Marian's servants. He never allowed me to call him Father and he never gave me his surname. So that's what you were after. All children want that and much more from their parents. They want affection. They don't want their parents to be ashamed of them. Get out, you brazen girl. I always told your father it was a mistake to bring you to live here. Forgive me, Aunt. I didn't mean to offend you. Lord Archibald's death has really upset me. Call the servants. -I don't know where Deborah has gone. -Don't bother, I'm here. Where have you been? I had to lock Rufus in. Milord's death has made him hysterical. Rita, leave us alone. It was you two, wasn't it? It could have been, but it wasn't. I think it was milady who took the initiative. We must call Mr Loy, the notary. And inform Baron Tobias and his wife. I'll attend to it immediately, madam. Deborah. Madam? Do you remember the book that Lord Marian used to read? The Book of the Apocalypse? I know it well. Last night, when my husband died, that book was open in the library. One line of one of the verses was underlined. There's nothing odd in that. His lordship could have done it before he died. Don't you believe in apparitions? Apparitions? No, milady. Neither in apparitions nor ghosts. On the other hand, I do believe in wills and inheritances. I'll summon Mr Loy. I'm sorry, Inspector. I can't open the will. I'll only do it in the presence of those I have to convene for the reading. I know, I know, Mr Loy. But Lord Marian was murdered in a most horrible fashion, and the name of the murderer may be written in the will. It may be one of the heirs. I understand, Inspector, and I'm sorry I can't help you, but a will is like a confessional secret, and if I betray it... You just open the envelope with care, we'll read what it says, and then you'll seal it up again. I promise you that no one will ever know. Just me and my professional conscience. Don't insist, Inspector. All I can do is read you the instructions which the deceased left me to be carried out immediately following his death. All right, you win, Loy. "Before 24 hours have elapsed after my death, the following people must be summoned to my estate Park Manor. My wife, Lady Cecilia Marian, my cousin Baron Simon Tobias, his wife, Lady Marta Tobias, my illegitimate daughter, Rita Derian, and my servants, Rufus and Deborah Potts. When they are all gathered in the library at Park Manor, my last will and testament shall be read." I didn't know that this girl Rita was Lord Marian's daughter. Who is her mother? She died years ago. She was a servant at the house. And this couple, Baron Tobias and his wife? They live in Brighton. They've been sent a cablegram. -Have the others been informed? -Not yet. Mr Loy, Mrs Deborah Potts wishes to see you. I'll see her shortly. As I was saying, Inspector, the others haven't been informed yet, but, as you see, they'll find out soon enough. Keep me abreast of any developments. -I will, Inspector. Good day. -Goodbye. Excuse me. Has your husband calmed down now? Of course, Inspector. He's much better. Take good care of him. He's a bundle of nerves. He could be dangerous. Don't worry. I'm looking after him and I'd never let him do anything bad. You can rest assured. You'd better be right. Will you come in, please? Good morning. Take a seat. I assume you've heard about Lord Marian's death. Lady Cecilia wants his will to be executed immediately. I followed Lady Cecilia downstairs. When I was halfway down the stairs, I heard her scream. I ran down and found her lying in a faint beside the pit. It was awful! How were you treated by your father and your stepmother? I'll tell you the truth. They treated me well as a servant, and badly as a daughter. And did you ever think about murdering your father? Yes. When I was a girl. Once, he gave me a brutal beating. I was eight years old. And after that? -I got used to his rough treatment. -Do they continue to beat you? They did that? She did. When she drinks she's like a wild beast. And what did your father say? He used to say to Lady Cecilia, "Fool, you don't know how to hit her properly. One day you'll have to kill her." Didn't you ever think of telling someone, of reporting them? My mother was black. He was Lord Marian, an important man in the English Parliament. Who would have listened to me? The chief wants you. He's asked for you several times. Okay, I'm coming. You can go now, but stay in the area. We may need you. -Where could I go? -Easy, now. Pardon me for crying. -Calm down. Goodbye. -Good day. -May I? -Come in. I thought the earth had swallowed you. I've been with Mr Loy, Lord Marian's notary. I see. This is Major Oliver Brooks, one of Scotland Yard's top brains. Inspector Bore has less grey matter but he's a loyal and trusty fellow. The Major arrived in town less than 24 hours ago on a special mission. From now on you'll be assisting him. -But I'm on the Lord Marian case... -So am I. More precisely, looking into his will. I don't follow. I happen to know certain things regarding the will. How did you learn of Lord Marian's death? It hasn't been made public. We owe our reputation to being able to find out many things before anyone else. When is the reading of Lord Marian's will? As soon as Baron and Lady Tobias arrive. Then it can be tomorrow, because the Baron and Baroness arrive tonight. They're staying at the Devon Hotel. You know that, too? -I'm staying there as well. -It's the best hotel around here. You see, I'm well informed. It's also the most expensive. I can see you're well paid. No, not at all. The hotel gives us a large discount. Let's let the boss get back to work. I'll stand you an aperitif at Renfield's. They make an excellent martini. Did you find that out at Scotland Yard, too? No. I had a couple before coming here. Commissioner, at your service. -After you. -Thank you. Excuse me. My hat. Good day, sir. Good day. What suite is Baron Tobias in? Number three. Bellboy, accompany the lady and gentleman. At once, sir. Number three. Hurry. That's Simon Tobias, isn't it? Yes, sir. I gave him number three, next to yours. -Give me my key. -Yes, sir. Hurry up, dear. We must finish as soon as possible. That's what I want. To finish with this whole dirty business. Soon we won't have to worry anymore. You must stay calm for a few days. It's for your own good. If your nerves give you away... Yes, I know you're capable of murder. You needn't tell me again. You don't know how pleased that makes me. Now I shall proceed to read the will of Sir Archibald Percival Marian. "In the event that my death be natural, open this envelope and destroy the other one." "In the event that I be murdered, open only this envelope and destroy the other one." Well, that's rather unusual. I assume we can accept that Lord Marian was murdered? Of course. There's no doubt about it. I have official evidence, including the autopsy findings. We'll enclose them with the report. Now... "I, Archibald Percival Marian, being of sound mind, do curse my possible murderers, the whole avaricious pack, and take pleasure in disinheriting them all except for the only person who certainly had nothing to do with my death, although the only one who had every reason to, Rita Derian, my daughter. I name her as sole heir to all my worldly goods in the hope that she will be able to forgive her unjust and arrogant father." It can't be. Lord Marian promised to remember us in his will. It's not fair! -We've spent our whole lives in his service! -Be quiet! -This is an injustice! -Be quiet, all of you! You know me, I'm Inspector Bore. I beg your pardon for the interruption but I have good reasons for stepping in, and, for the time being, suspending this meeting. Please go back to your rooms. I shall expect you to be here tomorrow at the same time. I have to complete my report. I'm sorry, young lady, but we must wait. I'll do as you say, sir. I need to know if this farce will be over tomorrow, Inspector. I have pressing business in London. Duty calls. Don't worry. It'll take two or three days. I know you're staying at the most expensive hotel in town, but you could always come and stay here. There are rooms available, and you'd all be together. Don't be stupid, Inspector. We'll remain at the Devon Hotel. Price is no object. What are you up to, Inspector? Nothing. I always play fair. Inspector, I'd like to ask you a favour. What is it? Couldn't you leave someone on guard tonight? What's the matter? I'm afraid. Please help me. Damned half-caste! You thought you'd have it all, eh? Put me through to room number three. Yes. Who is it? Good morning, madam. Wake up your husband and come along to Lord Marian's house. There's important news. We'll need at least an hour to get ready. Come as you are. You look lovely in your nightgown. I won't tolerate rudeness! Who is this? Police. How do you know I'm in a nightgown? The police are very clever. Hello! Hello! Hello! -Who is it? -Inspector Bore. They're here. That fellow, Albert Pagan, he's come with a Chinese woman or something like it. With a Chinese woman? I'm not surprised. He's always been like that. He's an odd fellow. You know him? Very well. He's the black sheep of the family. Nobody wanted anything to do with him. He ran a brothel in Soho. Now, I believe, he does the same in the Caribbean. Alfred Marian has also arrived. Alfred? -What's he like? -A well-groomed young man. What shall I do with them? Take them to Park Manor right away. The others will be there soon. -And the notary from London? -He'll arrive in time. Are you coming? No. I won't go. It's not wise for them to see me yet. -I do things in my own way. -Very well. My hat. Careful, one day you'll forget your head. Eddie, you old drunkard. Come on, you've slept long enough. Come on! What are you doing in my room? What have you come for? What do you think? Waiting for you to wake up. Today is November 20, we're in Louisiana, and you have to read Lord Marian's will. Listen carefully. Don't forget that I'm Major Brooks of Scotland Yard. Got it? All right. Hey! Get me a glass of rum to take the edge off. As we are unable to find Lady Cecilia Marian, I am obliged to start this session without her. The newcomers here are Albert Pagan, his wife and Alfred Marian. The former is the deceased Lord's cousin. Alfred Marian is Lord Marian's illegitimate son, although he was recognised by him some years ago. However, Alfred never knew his father. He and his mother, a music-hall artist, received a life pension administered by a legal firm in London. I'll let Inspector Bore address you now. He'll bring you up to date with certain details. As I mentioned to you, the will which was read previously appeared highly irregular. We have received fresh information from London which reveals that Lord Marian made a prior will several weeks before moving to this area. This will, which shall be read now, was made secretly. The reason is that it contains two or three surprises, as surprising as the existence of Lord Marian's other cousin, Mr Pagan. And, above all, that of his son Alfred. I shall leave you with the notary from London, Mr Pimperton. I must absent myself for professional reasons. Ladies and gentlemen... Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Hello, Inspector. I'll be right with you. -How are you, Inspector? -Hello. Another strange, perverse crime. The poor woman was bound to that stone while alive. She was killed by the force of the wind. It must have been an agonizing death. Would you say this death is related to that of Lord Marian? Wouldn't you? It's the same insane mind at work. I'm sure of it. Cecil, we'll head back to Park Manor. "All of my possessions will be divided in the following manner. To Albert Pagan, Thirty percent of my fortune on condition that he return to England to lead an honest life. Thirty percent to my son, Alfred. Thirty percent to my wife, Cecilia, and the remaining ten percent to Simon Tobias and his wife. As for my properties in England, they shall be split 50-50 between Albert Pagan and my son, Alfred. To Simon and Marta Tobias, I leave my estate in Louisiana on condition they take up residence and keep it in good repair. Pray to God that I may find eternal peace. Signed, Sir Archibald Percival Marian." The existence of these two totally different wills, the surprising diversity of heirs, the murder of Lord Marian and the appearance of new characters and events relating to the deceased's inheritance force me to open an investigation and to suspend the execution of this will. Mr and Mrs Pagan and Mr Marian can stay in this house. And none of those present shall be allowed to leave the county. I protest! You have no right to do this to me! -I demand... -Be quiet! Let me finish! I've just found out the reason for Lady Cecilia Marian's absence. She's been murdered. And until the police believe otherwise, you are all under suspicion of murder. Are you my sister? I'm sorry to meet you in such sad circumstances. But I'd be even sorrier not to have met you at all. Rufus! Bring some more. What a bunch of hypocrites! We're sitting here in silence because Lady Cecilia Marian has been murdered. We all hated that whore, didn't we? It's funny. Don't you remember his haughty, dignified air that hid a cruel, twisted mind? And he had to put up with... Carry on, Mr Pagan. What were you going to tell us about Lord Marian? I don't think this is the best time to speak of the dead. Forgive him. He's had too much to drink. He's a very impressionable man. Yes, forgive me. I'd better retire now. I don't feel very well. This must be Lord and Lady Marian's bedchamber. This bedchamber is cursed. There's a presence of spirits haunting it. I can feel them. I'm frightened, Mairu. Something strange is going on here. What are you talking about? I last saw the Lord, my cousin, 20 years ago. I was very young, but he wasn't. A man can't change so much in that time. What do you mean? Did you see the portrait in the dining room? I'm sure that man is not Lord Marian. If you'd like, I can summon the spirits of the dead. I can ask them to speak to resolve the mystery. Do it, Mairu. I've never believed in superstitions, but try it. Maybe you can get through. These last years he was always in a bad mood. He was irritable and inflexible. He wasn't a real father in any sense. Still, incredibly, in the first will he named me as sole heir. Listen, Rita. What is it? Won't you tell me what the matter is? It was her. His wife. She beat me with a strap. But why? What did you do? She was drunk. And furious about the inheritance. It wasn't the first time. He often treated me brutally, too. Ever since I came to this house, they both wanted to get rid of me. It's all over now. Go to bed. My room is just opposite. If you need anything, give me a call. I'm a light sleeper. Good night, Sister. Good night, Brother. Wandering spirit, do not remain in darkness. Manifest yourself, spirit of the man who dwelt in this house. I feel your presence. Come to me. I hear you, I feel you, spirit. Come closer, come closer, spirit. You must come forward and tell us who you are. Resolve the mystery. Come closer, soul in torment. Tell us the name of your murderer. Tell us if you are Archibald Percival Marian. After him! He's still alive. -Get him to the hospital. -Yes, sir. He's dying. Listen, Rufus. Can you hear me? Yes, I can, but I feel terribly ill. I'm sorry, but I have to question him. Question him? Impossible. He's been delirious for hours. I had no choice. I had to do it. I had to do it. Rufus, you're dying. Dying! Dying. Are you a believer? Yes, I believe in God. I believe in God. He may forgive you if you confess. God wants you to confess your guilt. Will you? Confess? Yes, I confess. I had to kill Pagan and the Oriental woman. They had discovered the truth. And you also killed the secretary, the phoney Lord, and Lady Cecilia. Rufus! Who killed the real Lord Marian? Who? Do you know their names? We have to revive him. Give him an injection, Doctor. An injection? They haven't yet invented an injection to resurrect the dead. Everything is clear now. Especially regarding the wills. The one drawn up here is false, made by the phoney Lord. The only valid one is the one made in London by the real Lord Marian. The fortune will be divided among the surviving relatives named in the will in the following way. Three parts for Alfred Marian and one part for Baron and Baroness Tobias. The properties will be distributed as per Lord Marian's will. In view of the tragic circumstances of Mr Pagan's death, the possessions in England will go to the deceased Lord's son, and the estate in Louisiana to Baron and Baroness Tobias. Where are you going? To pack my things. You can do that tomorrow, we'll leave together. What are you saying? Have you forgotten that it's all a farce? That we're not brother and sister? I'm the daughter of one of your father's murderers. Listen! I'm glad we're not siblings. It opens up new possibilities. Here's to our new home. Feeling better? A bit better. Won't you forgive me now for all those things in the past? I don't know. But it's a great relief that we're no longer financially ruined and don't need to go on living a lie. It all went better than expected. Let go of me! Just because I feel better, it doesn't mean that I'll submit myself to the advances of a murderer. One day I'll kill you. Spying through keyholes now? It's the Tobias' room. But hadn't you closed the case? As far as you're concerned, you old fox. But not for myself yet. You're right, sir. We've just found the body of Deborah, the housekeeper. She was murdered some hours ago. She was burnt to death. Undoubtedly the same maniac. She was set alight while still alive. How awful! We'll go to Lord Marian's house at once. "Earth to bury us. Wind to scourge us. Fire to burn us. Standing atop the stony heights with rooks and ravens all around me..." "And contemplating the raging fire spread ever further by the wind "and which the rain endeavoured to extinguish." A lovely passage from The Apocalypse. You're Alfred Marian. Aren't you? Yes, sir. I knew your father. And yours, too, miss. My name is Brooks. I'm from the English police. May I see the book? Did you really know my father? Didn't you? No, sir. I don't remember him. I was a very small boy when... Pity. A strange man, your father. Did you notice? The underlined parts correspond to the ways in which Jennings, Cecilia and Deborah were murdered. Very perceptive. You'd make a good policeman. You could almost say it's as if Lord Marian had risen from his grave to take revenge on his murderers. Don't tell me we've got to go on a ghost hunt. Yes, we do, Bore. We're in zombie country. Don't forget it. Yes. I beg you to stay. We'll feel safer. Tonight I'll stay here, and if you don't mind, I'll sleep in Lord Marian's room. Do you believe in ghosts? Well, I'm superstitious and I believe in the afterlife. Perhaps you find that ridiculous. Not at all, miss. I, too, believe in ghosts. I'm very happy to have found you. So am l. It's wonderful that our parents were the way they were. Cecilia's scheming, the two wills, it's all wonderful. Yes, my love. If not for all those horrible things, we'd never have met. Or we'd be siblings, like we first believed. Is something wrong? No. Excuse me a moment. What were you looking for, Alfred? Miss! Miss! What's the matter? She's fainted. Fred, Fred! She's been hit on the head. She must be taken to the hospital, she may have a concussion. Get him to the hospital, too, and keep them in overnight. -They'll be safe there. -Yes, sir. The killer is here among us. There's no doubt about it. And we have to catch him. Don't you understand? Search the house. Meanwhile, I'm going into town. Into town? Yes, Bore. That's where our case will be solved. Not here. It's nearly 11:00. At 1:00 sharp I'll be at the police station with the criminal. See you. Do you remember the old days? Yes. Since I'm drunk, I can daydream. We're at a little hotel in Dover on our honeymoon. I remove your shoes, I run you a bath, I undress you. Meanwhile you caress me and say... I love you. You are my wife. And you will be till death do us part. Till death do us part. What are you doing? I'm still in my dressing gown. It will be your shroud. You thought I was going to let you live? Sooner or later you'd have given me away. No, no, I swear. I swear! I love you! A perfect crime. She was drunk and fell asleep in the bath. Isn't that so, Simon Tobias? Who are you? Who? A ghost, an apparition. An avenger. You killed the others? Yes, all those who killed Lord Marian. There were only Marta and you left, but you've made things easier for me. With your death, my revenge will be complete. But how do you know? Why do you want to kill me? Who are you? Who are you? I told you, a ghost. Don't you believe me? Archibald Marian! Yes, Archibald Percival Marian. Peer of the realm, who you brutally beat while he read a verse, this verse. "Four elements created. Earth to bury us. Wind to scourge us. Water to drown us. Fire to burn us." One by one you fell to earth, to fire, to wind. Only water remained. It's funny that by killing Marta, you completed the verse without knowing it. After you I'll kill Jennings' daughter, and then it will all be over. I can't believe it. How did you survive? We had it all worked out. You failed to deliver the coup de grace. I was picked up by some fishermen. I was unconscious. When I came to, I'd lost my memory. I adopted the name Brooks, the same as the man who saved me. I became a policeman. I was rapidly promoted. I had lost my memory, but not my intelligence. One day, my job took me to Yorkshire. On seeing my house and my land, it all came back to me. I decided to take advantage of my position to get revenge on my killers. I have it all planned. In the eyes of the American police, you will be the criminal. I'll do it well. I know my job. Archibald, listen. Don't do it! Don't do it! -No messages? No calls? -No. Hello, Constable Robbins speaking. Hello. How are you? Much better. Thank you for coming. And you. Nothing serious, was it? I'm a bit groggy. It was a hard blow. Why don't you go to bed? You'll feel totally restored after a few hours of sleep. I don't want to leave her alone. Who's thinking of leaving her alone? I'll stay with her while you sleep. -I don't want to cause you any bother. -Don't worry. I'm not tired. Go on, darling, do as Mr Brooks says. I've got the room next door. -If anything happens, call me. -Relax, lad. I will. That was the Devon Hotel. Water is pouring from one of the bathrooms, flooding the floor. So they should call a plumber. They don't dare go in. They say there are guests inside. -Did they say the name of the guests? -No. Call the hotel, quickly! Wake up! Wake up! Listen carefully. I want you to know you're going to die. So you thought you'd deceive Alfred and rob him of his inheritance, you dirty half-caste. But you won't get away with it. You're the last on the list. You won't get away with it. I'm sorry, my friend. I had no choice. How did you think to come here? You forgot to turn off the tap in the Tobias' bathroom. Then I looked in your room and found the murderer's disguise. Bravo, Bore. I underestimated you. You reason well and shoot better. Why did you do it? That's a secret I prefer to take with me to the grave. You're wrong, Brooks. You're dying. Your country's police force will look very bad. You were one of Scotland Yard's best. You win, Bore. I did it all because I... am the real Lord Marian. Now maybe the police will be spared, But... the aristocracy will be reviled. I feel sorry for them. You, Lord Marian, my father? Not a very good father. Forgive me, son. Take him away.
