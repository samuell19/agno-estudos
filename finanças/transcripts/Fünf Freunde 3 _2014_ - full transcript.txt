FAMOUS FIVE 3 - Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Tao Lapai. But this time, we'll really relax. Promise? - Timmy! - Timmy! - How was your flight? - Everything okay? If it isn't my old college pal Quentin. Cha-Li! Nice to see you. - What's up with him? - I think he feels sick. Sick as a dog! Let's go, Timmy. - We can start work right away. - Let us get settled first. Oh, hi kids. You're Julian. Anne, Dick. Timmy... And you must be George. Last time, you were still in diapers. With big stinkers in there. What did we used to call her? Poopsy! - Poopsy. - Thanks for accepting my invitation. If my old friend needs me, I'm here. - Can I help you with your bags? - Anne might need a hand. I can never decide what to bring! You're lucky with the weather. We had a pretty heavy storm here. - A category 3 hurricane. - Category 3? On the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It was introduced in the early 70s. Category 3 is pretty neat. That's true. It certainly shook up the island. Shame you missed it. Yeah, a real shame. What are you doing? The delivery entrance is at the back. You're blocking the way. This area is reserved for cars, not rickety bicycles. Scram. Get a move on! - Hello. - Welcome! - Hello. - Calm down, Timmy. - Sorry for the inconvenience. - Let me introduce you. - This is the resort's owner, Mr Haynes. - Hello. Kirrin. It's a pleasure. He's a friend of the sciences. He's kindly offered us a room we can use as a lab. That goes without saying. If I've understood correctly... You're working on a revolutionary method that neutralizes greenhouse gases. That's right, we want to turn dangerous climate killers into harmless liquid. - We haven't reached that point yet. - I wouldn't understand, anyway. But now that the famous Professor Kirrin is here... - You're sure to succeed. - Let's hope so. I've had our nicest bungalows prepared for you and the kids. That's nice, right kids? Where are they? Run, Timmy. Come in the water! You beat me again, you crazy bird! - I won, I won. - That's enough now, you two. - There are new arrivals over there. - New arrivals! - You mean those kids? - Who else? - Look alive. Go sell them something. - Slave driver! Slave driver! Shut up, or I'll serve you for dinner. What are you waiting for? Keep your drool! Drool, drool, drool! "Keep your cool", Hugo. Cool. Now it's time to relax. You have to come in next time, Timmy. It's warm, like a tub. Hi kids! Welcome to paradise. Watch out! Got you! Okay, that's enough. - Behave, Hugo. - Yes, sir! Whether on land or under water, Hugo, Nick and Lady Cassi have all your needs covered. You're in for a wild ride. Yes, sir! Wild ride! You don't look like you just came here to chill. - We don't? - No. You want action. To race around the island with one of our boats, right? - Right? - Yeah. Nice of you to ask, but no thanks. We do just want to chill. Lazy bones! Really? Shame. - Yeah, it's a real shame. - Real shame! Well, you know where you can find us. Maybe... Well, we can race around the island next time. If we ever come here again. Right, maybe in 2047 or so... Hand over the doughnuts! It's "dough"... Now shut your trap. - It's pretty expensive... - Maybe we can give you a discount. It's our newest and biggest boat. There's even diving equipment on board. Cool, diving equipment. - Have fun! - Ciao. Let's go, Timmy. - Did you repair the jet skis? - On it. - You said that two weeks ago. - Really? Couldn't care more. It's "less"! Now put a sock in it! I'm so sick of this island. - We haven't even been here that long. - What? Over three years, since you messed up our last coup. They're searching for us all over Europe. We live where others go on holiday. I want to live where others... live. Oh, my tummy. This thing doesn't really look new. You think it can carry us all? You know what? Timmy and I will stay here. - Really? - Go on without us. We'll chill a bit and work on the perfect tan. Okay. - Watch out for yourself, Anne. - See you later. - See you later. - Off we go. Look at that. It's unbelievable. - That doesn't sound good. - Not at all. - What is it? - Something's caught in the propeller. I'll have a look. - There's a shipwreck down there. - What? - Yes, a shipwreck. - Did it sink during the hurricane? - No, it looks ancient. - Maybe the hurricane pushed it to shore. - That happens. - We have to dive down. Yeah. - Have you ever dived before? - Of course. And it's not that deep. Come on, Julian. What could possibly go wrong? Alright. Let me check the equipment. There are only two tanks. One of us will have to stay up here. I'm definitely going down! Rock, pa per, scissors? I'm like the unofficial world champion in that. Might as well give me the wetsuit already. Thank you. Say, your stilettos... Are they originals? My dear, do I look like I'd wear cheap copies? Yes. Oh, Timmy. You'd only get seasick on the boat. And it's probably dead boring. Rock, paper, scissors. Sorry, Dick. You're in charge of our safety. It's important, too. Right. A shark! George, Julian! A shark! Julian! Darn. George, please... Julian, George! A shark! Come to the surface. What's keeping you? George... Where are you? Julian... A shark. Get up here. Please... Hurry up. Get out! Hurry! Hurry! That was a close call. You can say that again. I... - I can't believe it! - Anne... - Calm down. - Calm down? You almost got eaten alive. Well, I wouldn't put it that way. I would. - But only barely. - And all because of some old shipwreck? And... because of this. What's that supposed to be? Who knows... It looks like an old compass. Here, have a look. Something's written on it. "J.M." Let me see that. "J.M." John Maranak! - Where did you find that? - We stumbled upon it. - I'll give you five dollars for it. - No, thanks. It's a good deal. The compass is broken. It's not worth anything. So why do you want to buy it? Because it's of no use to you. But it is to you? Ten dollars. My last offer. No, thanks. You come here and think you own everything. Typical tourists. She was really keen on this thing. Think it's worth something? It looks that way. - Here. - Let's go, Timmy. John Maranak... I'm curious to see what'll happen. You see? That happens every time. If it was so easy, someone would have done it by now. It's probably the dosage. Less carbonate and more olivine. Hey, kids. How are you doing? You okay, Poopsy? Great, thanks. Cha-Li, you're from here. Ever heard of John Maranak? John Maranak? Yes, I have. He was a notorious pirate. He caused a lot of trouble around here. He was better known as... "One-Arm Ted". - Are you all up to mischief again? - No, Dad. Don't worry. It's all just a legend. But apparently, he plundered dozens of ships and amassed a huge hoard of gold. It was here... "...on Tao Lapai that he hid his treasure." Hello? I have something for you. Like I said, it's just a legend. I'm a scientist. That's why I stick to the facts. Right, Quentin? - Darn! - Darn! - Wow, that stinks. - Kids, we need to work now. The skeleton with the grappling hook must have been One-Arm Ted. And this is his compass. But there must be more to it. Why else would that girl have wanted it? We can find out tomorrow. Let's hit the hay. - And dream about pirates. - And sharks. Sleep, Timmy. Caught red-handed. Catch the thief! Faster! Come on! Anne, Dick... Go that way! I knew it. Give us the compass. Next time, we'll call the police. Now, beat it. I know someone who can fix the compass. Is this some kind of celebration? It's an old ritual of our tribe. The balloons carry our worries to the sky, and they disappear forever. Then... Then you must have a lot of worries. Joe! Joe! Later. I wanted to visit Dang Song. Come with us. You're invited. Don't worry, he knows what he's doing. Hiding something precious in something worthless. One-Arm Ted's favorite trick. This compass points to his treasure. With the treasure, I'll be able to save our village. Joe, can you see where the needle's pointing? It's pointing towards the Noteka. Yes, but... it's our only chance. It's too dangerous. Joe was always stubborn. My tribe has lived here for 900 years. In three days, the excavators will come to destroy everything. So Haynes can build his resort. - Haynes? - The hotel manager. But why... We live from fishing. Last year, there was another storm here. All the fishing boats were destroyed. We desperately needed money. Haynes lent it to us. But he tricked us. How? He fished our bay dry with large cutters. That meant we couldn't repay the loan. Unbelievable. Come on, Timmy. - Where are you going? - Where else? - To save your village. - There's a treasure out there. - But in the Noteka there are lots of... - We know. There's a treasure out there! That's right, Hugo. So, we have a deal. I'll get you two brand-new passports, top-notch fakes... I know how much you want to go back to Europe. Paris, here I come! So that you don't lose track of the brats. - What type of contraption is that? - A tracking device, of course. A tracking device. Naturally! I'll casually tag it onto the kids. - Hi, Joe! - Hello! Come on, Timmy. Hop! - Catch, Dick. - Throw it over! Come on, Anne. - Hurry up. - Oh, you're going on an excursion! Hope you have lots of... fun! Oh, sorry. We'll keep in touch. Right? - Weird guy. - What was that all about? - Whatever, we should push off. - Aye aye, Captain. Amazing. Be careful. Welcome to the Noteka. Did you know the world's most poisonous animals live here? - Really? - Yeah. Great. Okay, we have to go down here. Unbelievable. They're really heading into the Noteka. There we go. - What's that for? - What do you mean? Do you know how many disgusting critters are on this island? - Flashlight. - Flashlight? Don't listen to Dick, Anne. Most animals here are scared of you. Really? Well, all except the black forest hopper. You have to beware of that one. It's just a small beetle. You barely notice its bite. But then you get a fever. And then... Dick... Too much information. Yes, Hugo. Left two, three, four! Slow down. They must be nearby. How can you be so stupid? It's not going to pick itself up! Slave driver! - The buttery is gone! - Hugo, it's called "battery". The battery... - What was that? - Let's go have a look! Be careful! - Quit whining! - But it hurts. "But it hurts." It hurts. It hurts so bad... What do you see? Nick and Cassi. What are they doing here? - Anytime now... - Just a second. We can't let those brats get too far ahead. After all, we want to be there when they find the treasure. And then... Bang ".bang" .bang. - How do they know about the treasure? - No idea. What did you say? Everything's muffled under this thing. Then take that stupid hat off! I'm going to get it back. What now? Baby, it flew back to me! You idiot, the children! After them! After them! Hurry! Keep going! Nick, wait a minute. Nick... stop! We have this thing. Why go through so much trouble? - I always have to do everything myself. - Baby! That way. Okay... I think we've lost them. Great. Dick... which way now? - No idea. You have the compass. - You were the last one who had it. Oh, shoot. Baby... Have a look at this. You're not as dumb as you look. Thanks. We don't need this anymore. - Alright. We have to go... - That way. No, that way. - Hugo! - I know! - Man, I don't believe it. - They actually found the compass. Okay, I have a plan. I'll distract them, and you grab the compass. What? Not a good idea. You know Cassi has a gun. What else can we do? Keep an eye on them. Dick, will you give me a hand? Okay. What are you doing? That's a snake. Pass me two berries, please. - Ever heard of snake venom? - Ophiotoxin. Of course! The venom from this snake causes paralysis for 20 minutes. You mean, neuromuscular paralysis? Whatever. A berry in their mouth, and they'll be out of action. How are you going to get them to eat one? The treasure will allow me the life I've always dreamed about. You? I thought us? Wicked. They're paralyzed. - Crazy. Let's go, Timmy. - Unbelievable. Did you get it? We have to push off. Come on. Keep your cool, Nicky. - Something's wrong... - Keep your drool! Drool, drool, drool! You were supposed... I can't... Idiot. Wait. let me do it. I'm more than just a brain. Those pesky brats. Evil... rascals! Picking a fight with me was a big mistake. Those darn... kids will have to... pay for this! Revenge is tweet! That's right, you foul creature. Is everything okay? Do you have a cramp or something? No, everything's fine. By the way, your shoes look really cool. They look great on you. I won't say what I'm thinking. Hopefully, that's not what's happening. I'm afraid that's exactly what's happening. You don't think that Dick... No way! - Let me help you. - Okay, you're right. Thanks, but I can handle it. - Come on. - Right, just because you're a girl... You're doing well. Those cheeky brats. Thought they could side-track us. Bull's eye! Bull's eye! - I'm going to kill that thing. - He didn't do it on purpose. You know he has a sensitive stomach. It's his wheat intolerance. Let's see if he has a lead intolerance, too. If you shoot him, you'll have to shoot me first. That's right! What a tempting thought. Come on, let's go. She belongs in a cage! - What is it? - Nothing. We need to find a place to camp. It'll get dark soon. That sounds like a plan. - Man, it's so dark. - Because you forgot a flashlight, idiot. The kids probably won't be hiking the whole night. I won't let a bit of darkness stop me. Loggerhead. Loggerhead. Everything okay, baby? Of course. Totally. We'll catch those cheeky brats tomorrow. - That's what I thought. - Good night. How... How will we know when we've found the place the treasure's buried in? If the treasure is within the compass' gravitational field, then atypical circulations will occur as we get closer. Right. We'll know we're above the treasure when the needle starts spinning. Right. - The treasure must be worth a fortune. - Yeah. Hopefully, my share will be enough to settle our debt with Mr Haynes. Along with our share. We don't need the treasure. We have everything we need. It belongs to you and your village. You guys... You guys are alright. For tourists, that is. I don't feel so well. - I think I'll go lie down. - Can I do anything? No, I just need sleep. I bet I'll feel better again tomorrow. - Good night. - Night. I think we should all turn in. We have to push on at the crack of dawn. We'll take turns keeping watch. - Timmy and I will take the first shift. - Let me do it. I can't sleep anyway. I'm much too excited. I'll keep watch with you, so you're not alone. Okay, but no sleeping! Wild animals... Jungle... Dick Kirrin... Don't be afraid, Joe. I'll save you. Hush, not so loud! Loud... hush. Timmy? So... now we'll grab them. On the count of three. One... two... Baby, they're gone! It's still warm. They can't have gotten far. How did they find us again? - They always know where we are. - Wait! Oh, an excursion. Hope you have lots of... fun! We'll keep in touch. Right? What is it? A Genghis 66. - And what's that? - A tracking device. It's ancient, but it still works. What do we do now? We have to go that way. If... If you want us to take a break, just say so, okay? I will. But I'm okay. Maybe later. Seems like it's close by. But there's nothing here. Dick! - Not bad, Dick. - Nothing to it. It doesn't look very stable in here. Anne, we're not moving in. We just want to find the treasure. We'll have them in a minute. Darn it! Black hole! Monkey business... Got you. Got you! Am I bleeding? Now you are. Bad mood! Better fly away! I can't do this anymore. You can't be serious. What if the treasure doesn't exist? Of course it does. One-Arm Ted hid it here somewhere. "Hiding something precious in something worthless." Dick, you're brilliant. You, too. One-Arm Ted. Of course! To protect his gold, he transformed it into worthless stones. Look! Amazing! Unbelievable. We found it! Your village is saved! It must be worth a fortune. Real gold! Just look at it! - Julian! - Julian, what's wrong? Look! It's a bite. What bit you? The black forest hopper. Let's put him up there. Everything will be fine, okay? We have to get him to a hospital. He won't make it that far. We need the antidote right away. Julian! Where can we get it? We're in the middle of nowhere. We need to get to the Pandalla Canyon, where the gato berry grows. It's the only thing that can save him now. - Let's go. - Right. Stay calm, big brother. Anne, prop his legs up. Give him plenty to drink. And make sure he stays awake. - Your brother can't fall asleep. - Okay. The stripe is getting longer and longer. When it reaches his heart, then... Don't do anything silly, okay? I'll try. Come on, Timmy. Hurry! - Faster! Julian doesn't have much time. - Come on, Timmy. Got you! Super-Hugo is the best! Stay calm... You have to drink something, Julian. They're sure to be here soon. Everything will be fine then, okay? - Thank you, Anne. - For what? For being here. Of course. Please don't fall asleep. Hurry, it's up there! Over there... the berries. - Oh my God. - Oh dear! We have to get over there. - Be careful! - No! It won't hold our weight. - It's rotten. - But... Not us, but Timmy. I hope so, at least. Timmy, you're our only hope. Julian's only hope. See the berries over there? Go get them. Go on, boy. Please! Be careful! You can do it. Timmy! Well done, Timmy. Now go get the berries. - Bravo, Timmy. - Come back, Timmy. Who do we have here? Good job, Hugo. That mutt better muzzle it. I hate annoying animals. Quiet, Timmy. - Make sure he doesn't come back. - But... how? How do you think? Take this. - No! - No! So, time to start walking. Any time now! My brother needs the berries, or he'll die! I see. If that mutt can't fly, I guess it'll be the end of your brother. We're staying here. Oh, really? The next shot... will reach its target. Start walking! - Come on, hurry. - Bye, you old fleabag! Keep going! Julian? Stay awake. Stay with me. Please don't fall asleep! Okay, don't fall asleep. Finally, you made it. Did you find the berries? - Why not? - Because they were interrupted. Wow... Check this out, baby. The treasure. Go on, take it. My ticket! Paris! I'm coming! - Do you have it all? - Of course, baby. Slave driver! Well, kids, now we got you. As for your village... Your sweet, little village. I'm... not sorry at all! - You! - No, Joe. Let's go. Farewell. - Shouldn't we tie them up? - I have a better idea. Baby, what are you doing? Oh my God! What was that? Oh, man. We'll never get out of here. Julian... Julian, please. Don't fall asleep. Please... The line has almost reached his heart. No... Julian! His pulse... I can barely feel it anymore. Please don't fall asleep. Julian. Julian.Julian. Julian! Julian! Please stay awake! Timmy! - He has the berries. - Great, Timmy. You're the best! Water... I hope it's not too late. Please... Julian... Can you hear me? It's Dick. Don't let me down. I need you. You're my big brother. I know I get on your nerves a lot. That's true. Where... where am I? - With us. - You're with us. - That's good, right? - It sure is. The worst is over. Now we just have to get up there. Any ideas, Timmy? Great, Timmy. This should hold us. Okay, who wants to go first? Normally, I'd love to. But this time, I'll let you go first. Okay. Madness. Talk about extreme. I mean, they'll never get out of there again. - Never again! Never again! - See? Hugo thinks so, too. Hugo, too! Hugo, 1100! You wuss. You can pull off the next job with Hugo. I'm in! Oh! I'm not sorry in the least! Okay... That's enough. You have a stain! It's either that thing... Or me. - You can't be serious. - Does it look like I'm joking? Nick... Don't be a fool, Nick. Thanks. - That was pretty close, wasn't it? - I'll say. Let's go. Maybe we can still catch them. We must hurry. CLOSED They're gone. Darn it. Where are you going? I need to help my family pack. The excavators will roll in at noon. - Surely we must be able to... - You did what you could. It's over. But... Thank you... for everything. Poor Joe. But there must be something we can do. Watch out! - Got you! - Nick and Cassi don't need you anymore. Revenge is tweet! It's "sweet", you silly bird. Go get her! Get moving! What does he want'? A flight reservation. For two people. - When's the flight? - In 45 minutes. Let's go. We need to get to the airport! - Here you are. - Thank you. May I help you? Do you have a reservation? - Yes. - Your passports, please. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Relax. - Yeah. - Is that your hand luggage? - Yes. - Seems pretty heavy. - No, no. What's inside? Everything a woman needs. Hand it over. Hurry. To the tuk tuk! - Can you drive this? - It was never hard in the computer game. We'll bring it right back! Then I wish you a pleasant flight, Lord and Lady Rabenburg. Thank you. Have a nice flight. - I see we're noble now. - And filthy rich. Can I get a bite to eat? My stomach's growling like a bear. Of course, we still have a few minutes. Faster, Julian! - How much further is it? - We're close. Good day. Good day. What would you like? I'd like a sewing machine, please. Oh, you'd like some of this? It's an old recipe of my grandmother's. Delicious! You don't understand a word, do you? Wait here, Timmy! - See them anywhere? - No. Me neither. I don't believe it! The shoes! - What? - The high heels with the yellow sole. - Is that all you can think of? - Cassi has exactly the same. - Anne's right! - She's wearing a disguise. It's true! And the gold is probably in the case. Then let's get the treasure back. Nick! No! No! See you later! Sit down, you idiot! Oh, darn. They're following us! - Speed up, Julian! - Such bad luck! - We have to get rid of them. Faster! - Okay. - Come on! - Speed up! - Out of the way! - Faster! - Julian! - Faster! No! Woops! Look out! Careful! Sorry! Watch out! Out of the way! Get lost! Careful! Out of my way! Faster, speed it up! Faster, Julian. - Baby? - What? Hold on! - What now? - Over there. To the covered market! Those brats! Stop! Stop! Julian! Watch out, Julian! That was close, baby. Good job! You're already at the bay with the excavators? Wonderful. But wait for me... Of course I want to do it myself. You don't think I'd let the opportunity slip... Yes? What do you want? I'm here to ask you... to spare my village. - Your tribe can't pay me my money back. - Please, Mr Haynes. - Show some heart. - At noon, the bay will belong to me. - But... - In precisely... Five, four, three, two, one... - Stop! - What are you guys doing here? It's One-Arm Ted's treasure. - You got it back! - Of course. That should cover the debt. You'll have to build your holiday resort somewhere else. So, you got the gold back from Cassi and her hare-brained friend. - What? - How do you know... You're in cahoots with them! Well, we wanted to share it, but... I guess it all belongs to me now. - Thanks, kids. - What's the big idea? You don't think you brats can stop me, do you? - But you have your gold! - That's just peanuts. Compared to what I'll earn with your bay. You think that's a treasure? This is a treasure! Our bay! What are those towers? What are you planning to do? Without knowing it, your tribe has lived on the biggest treasure for centuries. Methane. - Natural gas. - A huge reserve. Worth billions. The best thing is, with the invention of Cha-Li and your uncle... You can mine and transport it cheaply. Clever boy. I'll liquefy it and fill my tankers. But my father and Cha-Li will never give you their invention. They already have. They had a breakthrough yesterday. Then... - We drank a toast and I... - What did you do to them? I'll take you to them. Get out! Go on. Scram! Looks like the tables are turned now. Yes, that's right, kids. Get over there. - Timmy! - Some friend he is. - You must be looking for the gold. - That would be nice. Later. Keep a close watch on the kids and the two scientists. I have to visit the Hanami village for a bit. An excavator's waiting for me. - Poopsy! - Kids, it's good you're here. There must be a toolbox over there. What's this? How nice. The whole family's reunited. - What are you going to do to us? - Well... nothing pleasant, naturally. Be careful. Don't open that. You should have thought of that before. Right, Nick? - Nick! - Look out. My goodness! That stuff is highly reactive. You oaf. Oh, man... Were you able to solve the problem? Yes, of course. We used too much hydrogen sulphide in the beginning, but... That's not important now! The oh-so-clever professor is right. Now cut the chatter! In the future, you sorry brats will think twice before messing with me. Oh, what am I saying? What future? Your future ends here and now. - My eyes! - Get them! - Just wait! - The gun! I've got it! - Mr Haynes, we're ready to start. - Excellent It's a nice day to destroy a village. Quick, we have to get over there. Hopefully, it's not too late! - I'll drive you. - Right! Hello? Please connect me with the police. - Yes, the police. - Don't worry, baby. I'll get us out. Bravo. Mr Haynes, it's not too late to do the right thing. But I'm doing the right thing. For me, at least. Let's get started. So long, Hanami village! Run! - Timmy! - It's those darn brats! - There! - Faster, George! Hurry! Haynes is a criminal. Stop him! What? What happened? He's paralyzed! - Joe? - It... it wasn't me. Dang Song... with a blowpipe. - Pretty cool. - Yeah. Seems like it runs in the family. We did it! Our village is saved. Bravo! We're staying! - Good job, Timmy. - Well done. What a great achievement. You can really be proud of your children. I am. But we never seem to be able to have a normal holiday. That would be too dull. Dull, dull! Dull as ditchwater! Super-Hugo! Super-kids! - This is delicious. What is it? - We call it "Hubtalo". A stew with poached snake eyes. Enjoy Your meal! Just kidding. Got you! Got you! What did you think we ate? - It's just normal fish soup. - Normal fish soup! Come with me. - Do you really want to keep Hugo? - Of course, he helped us. But you'll have to teach him some manners. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding! Just kidding. Just kidding! This is for you. - Thank you for everything. - Don't mention it. It was a cool adventure, right? Well, I thought it was fun. Not just fun, but somehow... I thought it was great. He'll never take another bath. Some things never change. Copyright ? 2014 TITELBILD, Berlin Subtitles: Todd Dennie et al.
