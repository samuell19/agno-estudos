One, two. We're gonna start very soon, Maurice. Sorry for the wait. Don't worry yourself. Can I get you anything? Coffee? Do you have any tea? We have tea. Just a cup of tea. Thanks, love. Milk, six sugars, please. Six? Yes, six, please. Thank you. Can you give me some levels, Maurice? Some what? Uh, talking. Can you just talk to me? Has the interview started? 'Cause I just ordered some tea. That's perfect. Eh? Okay. We good? We're rolling. Haven't got my tea. All right, then. We're good to go in three, two, one. I'm here with a legend of the golfing world. A man who has broken records and rewritten the history books. Maurice Flitcroft. Bless me. You made your name in the British Open in 1976. Now, why did you choose that particular tournament? Well, uh, more it chose me, really. I-it was a calling. You Americans might call it a destiny. And it was an unlikely destiny, wasn't it? Because you were working as a crane operator at the time, am I right? Yes, when I took up the game of golf in, uh, 1975, I was working full time as a crane driver, or operator, as you would say. So, well, tell us about the young Maurice Flitcroft. Did you dream of becoming a sportsman as a child? I... I had dreams, but, uh, you know, where I come from, Barrow-in-Furness, it's a small world. Put it like that. The only job options for a lad like me was the yard. Shipyard. "Shipyard fodder," they used to call us. My dad worked there and his father before him. You go in on your feet. You come out in a box. Oh, as a child, I did have ambitions, of course. That I might do, you know, something else. But any dreams I had tended to end up in pieces. When the war came, I was sent to live with a very nice family in Scotland. Things were very different there. They'd say things like: What do you want to be when you grow up, young Maurice? Probably just be in the shipyard like me dad. Och, you can be anything you want to be! The world is your oyster. I read books. I learnt languages. I played the violin. I played to a very high standard, actually. Never mind, Maurice. Practice. Practice is the road to perfection. Or I would have done if the war hadn't ended, but it did. So I was soon back in Barrow. Ended up shipyard fodder after all. And it was at the shipyard that you met your wife Jean, right? Yes, I did. I used to apply for other jobs. I tried lots of different things. And she'd let me use the post in the office for free. She was very kind to me. In the evenings she ran, like, a theater group for wayward kids. We got on like a house on fire. Pretty soon, I popped the question. Jean Patterson, will you marry me? I promise I'll give you champagne, caviar, diamonds. We'll travel the world together-- Stop. Turns out she had a kid. Michael. Out of wedlock and all, which was a big deal in those days. They call him all sorts at school. "Son of a whore." "Little bastard." Kids can be cruel. That's the teachers. So he never knew his dad? No. Never even met him. As far as he knows, he doesn't have a dad. Well, he does now. Heh, all of a sudden, my own dreams, well, they were put on hold. Because we were a family now. I had to help Michael find his dreams. Well, take your pick, son. World's your oyster. That's for me. Racing driver. Astronaut. How about this? Do you fancy a trip to the moon? No. Engineering? Yeah. Want to read my book? What do you think? Does it go there? Put it the other way round. Mikey got a degree. Ended up a manager at the yard. I always fancied a pop at academia myself, but pretty soon, we had not one, but two more mouths to feed. Gene and James, twins. They loved disco dancing. Even won the school cup. As for me own dreams, well, by now they were... They were a distant memory. But I made my peace with it. Then came the summer of 1975, and, well, everything changed. Mom, just have a look at the microwave. I prefer my own one, that's all. It's gas, Mom. Gas ovens are basically mini-bombs. Out. Well, it's not gone off yet so I think we're all right. Can you lot shut up? Get out of the kitchen. Thank you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey! Stop doing your stupid dancing near the new TV! It's not stupid dancing! Get out. We're professional disco dancers. That's not a job. Dad, tell him it's a job. It is a real job, isn't it, Dad? Good a job as any. How do you switch this on? I've told you before, you've got to use the remote control. Get out of that. Come on, Mike. This top is Gabicci! Oh, it's Gabicci! I said, can you pipe it down in there, please? Quiet, boys! Mike, watch this. Can you do that? You use that to change the channels. It's got loads of them. How many? Three. Blimey. You can use that from anywhere, providing that the lead reaches that far. Why can't you just use the switches on the side? Yeah, but why would-- Get off! Why do you have to use the remote? Why can't you just use switches? You can, but what's the point when you got that? I might be standing by-- Shut it! Dinner is served. Now you can see we've left Newton and we're chugging across the Atlantic. The spacecraft is shown by this-- Look, don't quote me on this, but... well, it's top secret. The, uh... The yard's gonna be nationalized. Government's taking over. Oh. And Hopkins has put me in charge of the changeover. Well. Good for you, son. He must have a lot of faith in you, giving you a big job like that. Yeah, I suppose. But it could be bad, Dad. There's gonna be a lot of redundancies when the ax falls. I mean, a lot. They need you, he says. So that's good. What about you? Oh, well. I'll get another job if it comes to it. What job? I don't know. There's always the bins. Come here. I'm doing-- Maurice. What is it? Sit down. Hey. I knew a young man once. Said he was gonna be a somebody. Promised me diamonds, caviar, champagne. "Travel the world," he said. Sounds like you should've married him. I know you've made sacrifices for us, Maurice. You don't have to look after us anymore. It's your turn now. For what? Well, it's up to you, isn't it? Can't think of everything. What we got today, then, Mol? Cheese and pickle. Oh-ho, yeah. What? It's my favorite, that is. Maurice, we've been hearing rumors there might be some business going on in the yard. You heard anything? Look, I-- I shouldn't be telling you lads, it's secret. But, uh, it's being nationalized. What does that mean? Redundancies. Lots of them. So if I were you, I'd get looking for something else. Shit. I see it as an opportunity, actually, really. You know, why not? What we got to lose? Seek and thou shalt find and all that. Willie, there must be something you've always wanted to do. If you could do anything in the world, what would you do? I don't know. What do you like doing? Mm... Drinking Guinness. Well, open an Irish pub. Your own Irish pub in Barrow. Cliff, you can go back to your old job. What old job? Said you did a bank job once. Right, yeah. Um, well, that's a-- Heh, that's a young man's game, that is, mate. Oh, come on, lads. We're in the prime of our lives. Shouldn't be talking like that. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I might go to the pub later on. I'm going up now, love. What are you doing? I've gotta finish this flipping nun's habit before I turn in. Well, don't be too late. You'll hurt your eyes. Well, it has to be done. Night. Night. Night, love. I believe that the job you do is fundamental to the future of Britain. Newton from the bunker. And now to Watson. Just misses on the right. So if he can just get this in. It's all on this to equal Watson's score. The title goes to Tom Watson. On his first appearance at this tournament. The new champion. Tom Watson. What a dream come true. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! So there we have it. What an image to end on. Tom Watson with the famous Claret Jug. I hope you'll join me, Tony Marsh, and the rest of the commentary team for the Dunlop British Masters... Dad. You all right, love? We heard screaming. Where is it? What you looking for, love? Hmm? Golf. Golf? Aye, golf. Golf? Saw it last night on me new telly. Going to have a crack at the British Open. Ten grand if you win it. Ten grand? Bloody hell. How do you go about getting in the British Open, then? I don't know. That's what I've got to find out. Bartender, beautician, busses. Sorry, there's nothing here about the British Open. That's disappointing. Maybe you could ask someone at your golf club? No, I'm not a member of a club. Okay. So do you know anyone who has anything to do with golf? No. Hang on. Yes, I do. I do! Fingers. Right, next. What is a par? Par is the optimum amount of shots you should take on any given hole. So for example, on a par four, the optimal amount of shots is four. Correct. What is a birdie? That is one shot under the par. So for example, par four, three. Uh, and a bogey? Bogey? I know that one, Dad. Answer's one of these, mate. Wow. Oh, they're even better than I thought. So shiny, aren't they? Mm. These were the cheapest ones and all. Really? Look. Crikey. Number 19. Need to be a millionaire to play this game. You should see what the clothes cost. Really? Might get Cliff onto it. ...from a Maurice Flitcroft in Barrow-in-Furness. Dad! You're on telly! And he says... No, what? ..."I was wondering how I might go about getting into the British Open Championship as I quite fancy lifting the old Claret Jug." Well, Maurice, all you have to do is write to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St. Andrews in Scotland and they'll send you an entry form. But remember, ask your mom and dad before you use all their stamps and things. Always warms my cockles when we get letters from keen youngsters like little Maurice. Left arm perpendicular to the sternum. Head at 30 degrees. Knees flexed at 20. What are you playing at? Sorry! Flipping heck! I don't owe you anything? No. For all this? No. No. I got all this and all this from my mate John down the market. You got this too? Yeah, yeah. Suede. It's good stuff, innit? Hat's perfect. You what? Clothes of the gods, Cliff. Oh. Well, he only gets the best, does Jim. I thought it were John. John. John. Yeah, John. Yeah, good lad, John. These sandwiches look nice, Jean. Love. Love, can you stop worrying about what you look like? Got to finish filling in this form. Mmm. What does that mean, handicap? That must be me ailments, I suppose. Like your false teeth? Lumbago. Touch of arthritis. Shall I put that down? Aye, put that down. Hello. You all right, lads? Here you go, Dad. Get a load of that. What's that? Money so you can practice on a golf course. Yeah, we got it dancing on high street. Honestly, should've seen it. They were chucking it at us. That's incredible. What do you hope to achieve? You know, with this dancing, like...? Money. Birds. Oh. "We're all of us in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars." Who said that? Oscar Wilde. Oscar Wilde. What do you think he meant by that? Don't sleep in the gutter! Aim for the stars. I mean, isn't there a trophy or a world cup or something? Yeah, think so. Well, enter it! Go and win it! But what if we lose? Doesn't matter. At least you can say you tried. That's the main thing. There's more to life than money, boys. Ain't that right, Cliff? Yeah. Though, having said that, money is flipping handy. Especially if you play golf. Yeah. Cheers! You're welcome, Dad. Thanks. Look at that, Jean! Hang on a minute. It's heavy. It says... "Don't need a handicap if you're professional." Well, just cross out that other stuff. Tick "professional." Make things easier. Professional? Mm-hm. You sure? Listen, you didn't see me practicing this morning. I am a whisker away. All right. A whisker away. Please welcome on the tee, Maurice G. Flitcroft. You all right down there, old boy? Oh. Yes. Hello, gents. Are you in the right place, old chap? Yes, I'm here to join the club. And I see you're a three ball. If you care to make it a four, I'm available. Happy to join. Uh, we're, um-- We're waiting for someone. Yes. George. George Green. Actually, thanks for the offer, gents. But, uh, on second thought, I think I'd prefer to play on my own today. I hope you don't mind. Maurice Flitcroft. Good luck, gents. Tossers. Flipping people. Snobs. Bloody-- Excuse me, sir! Hello, there. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bruce Atkins, the steward of the club. Oh, hello, Bruce. I-- I'm Maurice. How may I help you today, Maurice? I'm here to join the club, please. I see. Well, that's fine. But there is a procedure to follow to get entry to the club. Procedure? Yes. First you must be recommended by a committee member. Then you must play a round with two members to ascertain your level of skill, etiquette, et cetera. Then your application will be forwarded to the members committee, whereupon, if accepted, you'll be placed on the waiting list. How long's the waiting list? Currently two years. Oh, that's no good. Really? No, I'm playing in the British Open. The British Open? So I'll just play a round now. Very well. That'll be five pounds. Five pounds? And you'd need to buy some regulation golf shoes. I'm afraid we don't allow work boots. How much are the shoes? Ten pounds. With the green fee, that makes a round 15. Do you have 15 pounds, Maurice? Here he is. Maurice G. Flitcroft. Only requires par for victory. Hey! Get off the golf course! What you doing? Hey! Ooh! You cheeky sod! Oh, flip! Left me balls! Are you deaf? Tosser! Go on! Hands in your pockets. Maurice? Yeah, it's not bad, is it? Bloody hell. I thought golf was supposed to be relaxing, love? So did I. What's happened, Dad? Oh, I'm... I'm giving up on the Open, son. No. No, you're not. I am, love. I said you're not. Not until you've opened this. Go on. I said television is the only way to keep up with the Americans. Prestige counts for nothing if you can't see it. And what did they say? Excuse me, Mr. Mackenzie, sir? Yes, Jenny. Again, what can I do for you? Sorry, sir. I just want to show you this application. I'm not sure what to do with it. Oh, good Lord. Well, I mean, he's ticked professional, so-- But I just wonder whether it's real. Whether what's real? Whether he really is a professional. Why would someone say they're a professional when they're not? Well, to get into the Open. I don't think anyone's gonna be stupid enough to do that, my dear. No, that would be very stupid indeed. I'm in. I best get Cliff to get me some new golf shoes. Practice is the road to perfection. Flipping heck. Can't see a flipping thing. Fore. Oh-ho! Hey, that was a good one. I think. Mike. Hey, Dad. What you doing here? Hello, son. This your new office, is it? Yeah. Come on, then, give us a look. Not a great time. We got some big deals going down. Oh, big deals? Heh. Want a ciggy? No, no, no. You're okay. Son, I might, um... I might need a couple of days off, uh, next Thursday, Friday. Can you swing it? Yeah, yeah, I'll see what I can do. I think I might've found myself a new job, you know, like you said. Ah, great, Dad. It-- It is great. It's quite exciting, actually. I'm entering the British Open, you know, the golf thing. Really gonna go for it. I think I'm pretty good, actually. Dad, sorry, I've got to go. But that's good, Dad. Well, it's good to have your support, son. Go on. Get your deals. Go on. Okay, I'll see you later. All right. Ah, Mike. Hi, nice to meet you. Mike Flitcroft. Be fine. It's not gonna fit. Oh, yeah. Gene? It's aluminum, so it'll bend, won't it? Oh, bloody hell. Very nice. Shit. Lovely. Just-- It's all right. It's fine. Well done, Gene. Can you help instead of judging? We ready, lads? Yeah, fine. Yeah, all good. Yeah, ready. We're just putting it in the-- No, no. I'll-- Here. Come here. That's all fine. Here you are. Yeah? Now, look at that. Just remember, know whatever happens, no one can say you didn't try. You got your sandwiches. Sandwiches. Aha. Good. Made plenty there for the-- Thanks, Mom. I got it. Don't eat them all on the journey. No. Oh, no, no. Come here, you. Good luck. I love you. Mmm. They're still going. Come on, come on. No, put me down. Go on, you'll be late. Get going. I know. I love you too. I'm gonna get some claret for that jug on the mantelpiece. Do it. I'll get onto it. Bye, love. Yeah. Love you. The sun is shining this morning at Formby Golf Club on Merseyside, where, in a few minutes' time, the new stars of the golfing world will take their first steps to claiming the historic Claret Jug and a check for 10,000 pounds. Join us here in about an hour for what promises to be a tournament to remember. Oh! You practice on the beach and all? Uh, sorry, my English, uh-- Oh, no. Um... Ah, sí. Yeah, the bunkers. Heh-heh, sí. Um, Maurice. Maurice Flitcroft. Severiano Ballesteros. You what? Oh, sí, Seve, Seve. Hmm. Uh... Uh-huh. Uh... You know what I mean? Watch out, Seve. Yeah. Thank you. Right-o, son. What's first up? Uh, first hole. Um, 460 yards, trouble left and right. Four hundred and sixty yards. Par five? Par four. Par four. I reckon take a driver, get it right up there. Give us a chance going at the green. No. I've been a bit wild, you know, just of late, with my driver. I'll take-- I'll take my 4-wood. I never miss with that. Yeah. Okay. Um... Um, sorry, Dad. There's no 4-wood. You what? I must have left the 4-wood in the car. It's fucking James' fault. I did tell him. No, no. All right, all right, son. It's all right. I'll take my driver. Mind your language on the course. Yeah, sorry, Dad. All right? Ladies and gentlemen, this is game number 14. Please welcome on the tee, representing Pontypool Golf Club, Wales, and sponsored by Conway's, Jim Howard. Fucking hell. Please welcome on the tee, representing La Boudin Golf Club, France, and sponsored by McGranger Sport, Laurent Lambert. And finally, please welcome on the tee, representing Cumbria County Golf Club, England, and sponsored by... Vi-Vickers Shipyard, Maurice G. Flitcroft. Right, son. What we got left? Uh, well, hole's 460, and what we gone? Uh, eight. So, four five two to the pin. Right. I'll take me three iron, I'll just go for position. Yeah. Great shot, Dad! It's all right. Yeah, that'll do. Gene. Concentrate. Yeah, I-- Yeah, I was. Flipping heck. Oh! You see? Go on! Go on! All right? Tony, it's Lloyd. Yes. Listen, I want everything you can find on a "Maurice Flitcroft." F-L-I-T-C-R-O-F-T. Flitcroft. Half time scores, please, gents. Jim Howard? Thirty-three. Roundabout. Thank you. Laurent Lambert? Thirty-two. Halfway there, Gene. Thirty-two. And, uh, Maurice Flitcroft? Sixty-three. Sorry, say that again. Sixty-three. Good God. We, in Scotland, invented the game of golf. The British Open is the oldest golf tournament in the world. The most respected and prestigious. And we must do all we can to burnish that reputation. So you can say that to your dad the next time he spouts any of that nonsense, okay? Thank you for your time. Now-- Maurice Flitcroft has hit a sixty-three. Sixty-three? How the hell did that happen? I've no idea. Do the press know? Not yet. Good. Let's bloody keep it that way. Yeah. I must say, that... That was a bit disappointing. Mr. Flitcroft. Keith Mackenzie, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Society. May I have a word with you, please? Oh, course, course. Uh, here. It's an honor to meet you, sir. I'm very much enjoying the, uh-- You know, the championship. Good. Good. So are we, thank you. However my colleague and I were just wondering if you, uh, might've had your fill of it, so to speak. I'm sorry? We were just wondering if you'd like to retire, you know? I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm not sure I follow you. Heh, I'm sorry. I must get to the next tee. All right, Mr. Flitcroft. Let me speak plainly. We can all see you don't belong here, so why don't you just quietly gather up your things and let's not cause a scene, shall we? You know, there's one thing I can promise you, Mr. Mackenzie, and that is no. No, I certainly will not be retiring. My swing's just about to, you know, click in. Uh, so if you'll excuse me, I must get on. I must just thank a Mrs. T. Holness of Liphook Golf Club for a most wonderful cake. A Victoria sponge, no less. Now, my producer's just handed me a piece of paper. And either I need a new pair of glasses or there's something quite extraordinary happening out there on the course. That's nothing. Have you seen the new Audi 80? Bloody hell. Bloody hell. She is a beauty. Gorgeous, gorgeous. Word is, he played the first nine holes in a phenomenal 63 shots. Oh, see, beautiful lines. Clear lines. I don't bloody believe it. Boys, look who it is. Who is it? Some plonker who was here not long back. He said he was playing in the British Open, I thought he was having me on. Good Lord. His card reads seven, nine, eight, ten, there's a 12 there with a question mark next to it. Not sure what that means. Oh, there's a six. That's-- I think the authorities will be wondering how this happened. It says here his name is... Maurice G. Fl-- Oi, what's got into you, Flitcroft? Sorry, I was just trying to get a better signal but-- Ah! The snug, come on! So Clarke leads by one from Roberts on this opening morning. Now then, back to our intrepid hacker on the 13th. He's celebrating like he just holed for a birdie. But that was for a ten. That makes for an astonishing plus 38. I've never seen a number like that before. Now, back to the man of the moment. He's lost two balls on this hole. Which makes this for a nine and... That's in! And the crowd go wild. Tony, what've you got for me? A crane driver? Where from? Have you got an address? Stop, we got it. Stop moving, Flitcroft. Oh, dear. That's his fourth shot, and he's still not out of the bunker. At this rate he's gonna end up in Australia. Now, either somebody's slipped some Spanish licorice into my tea or his caddy is wearing basketball pumps. They really are a pair of bobby dazzlers. How do I know him? It says here, he's representing Cumbria County Golf Club in Barrow. Well, if he's the best they can do, I wouldn't like to see the rest of them. And he has a sponsor, believe it or not. Vickers Shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness. I wouldn't like to sail on one of their boats if he's been building them. The authorities aren't going to like it, but I can tell you right now, the name of Maurice Flitcroft will go down in history. It's, uh... It's quite a common name. Mm-hm. What time is it? Huh? Ah. Look at this crowd, Dad! Yeah. Must be doing something right. Well, let's, uh-- You know, give them something to cheer about. Four iron. Where is it? Next to the flipping pin, Dad! Well, this fellow is the story of the day. Maurice Flitcroft, on the last for a birdie. It'll be a surprise if this goes in. Wait until you hear the roar if it does. Oh, and it misses on the right-hand side. It was a good effort. This is for, I think, 119. Ooh, that was not a positive stroke. It's getting a little bit grisly now. And hopefully he'll put this in. And he does! That's 121. Remarkable. Ooh, double trouble! I believe that's called the caterpillar, that move, eh? Seen my grandson do that, heh. Not on a golf course, I must admit. I'm afraid with a score like that he won't be coming back tomorrow. But whether you like it or not, the day belongs to Maurice Flitcroft. Hello? Hello, can I help you at all? Oh, sorry. Uh, I'm looking for Maurice Flitcroft's house? Oh, well, you found it. I'm Jean Flitcroft. Maurice is my husband. Maurice. Lloyd Donovan, Sun newspaper. Hello. Wondered if you had any comments on what your husband did at the Open today? Oh, how'd he do? He shot 121. It's the highest score in major history. Oh, that's good! That mean he's won? No. A high score is bad. Is it? Oh, well. Never mind, you've got to start somewhere, ain't you. Um, about to pop the kettle on, do you want to come in for tea? Want a biscuit? Thank you very much, yeah. Maurice. Maurice. How does it feel to have shot the worst round in the history of the Open? I don't feel the score was a fair reflection on me play, actually. What score would be a fair reflection of your play? That's hard to tell. It's the first round I've ever played. What do you put your bad score down to, Maurice? Well, I'd say the main problem with my game today was that I left my 4-wood in the car. I don't mean to make excuses but I'm deadly accurate with my 4-wood. Deadly. What made you enter the Open? Was it a joke? Well, I-- No, no. No, it's no joke. Well, I-- No. Are you gonna try again next year, Maurice? Uh, yes. Yes, so, uh, I'll be back next year. I just need to practice. Practice more, a bit more and, well, "practice is the road to perfection," so if you'll excuse me, uh, I'll see you next year, chaps. See you next year, Maurice. Right-o, Maurice. You showed them, didn't you, Dad? Quiet, quiet when you go in, lads. Your mom must've gone to bed. What you doing? Yeah, sorry. Oh, still, look at least you tried. You know, that's the main thing, ain't it? Oh, yeah, that's right, son. Enjoyed it, I did. Yeah, good. All right. I'll just... Go in. I'll just get me things. Okay. Surprise! Oh! Oh. Flipping heck, you nearly gave me a heart attack! You didn't tell me, lads! We didn't know either. You didn't know? Willie! She didn't tell us. All right, Mol. Aw... Cliff. Oh! Great, Mol! Oh, look! Look, they did that. Champion! "Congratulations, Maurice. Our champion." Well... Oh... And you are. You did so well. I wasn't quite as good as I thought I was. Hey, just your first time, love. You'll show them next time around! Well. Oh, next time, yeah. Did the lads tell you about the 18th? I birdied it, nearly, right on the green. We saw it! You saw it? We saw it on the telly, in the shipyard, yeah. On the telly? Quiche? Yeah, d'you like it? I don't mind it, quiche. Yeah. What are you eating? They're twirls. Twirls? Twirls. Get off me! You all right, love? Hey, Mike, you coming for a snout? No, no, you're all right. Oh, did you see? Yeah, I did. Ah! Did you see the 18th, where I nearly birdied it? Heh. No, I must've missed that bit. Well, I know the standard wasn't ideal but-- Not ideal? Well, what were you thinking, Dad? You've never even played golf before. I've never even heard you mention golf in your life. But I told you. You've got to take these things up at age 6, you can't take them up at 46! Well, who says? Well, the world says. Okay? Reality says. Well, look what happened. What? Well, I were a bit nervous but-- Yeah, well, you had every right to be. Everyone at the yard's gone hopping mad. Well, what's he done to them? This disparages the name of the shipyard. What's "disparaged" when it's at home? Have you swallowed a dictionary, Michael, or what? Okay, you two. Can you get out, please? Nice. Well... I'm sorry I embarrassed you, son. It's not me I'm worried about, Dad. It's you. The redundancies are gonna be decided this week. Hopkins watched it as well. He weren't best pleased. Sorry, Dad. Bye, Mike. Yeah, thanks for stopping by. You off? So sorry. Drink? I'll have one. Yeah, lovely. Get another round in. Love, if that's what he decides, well, you know, it gives you more time to practice then, don't it? Hey? Oh, love. Hiya. There's someone I want you to meet. Hi, Maurice. I'm Lloyd Donovan. Sun newspaper. Listen, uh, can I, uh, get an exclusive? Exclusive? Yeah. Aye. For a fee, you know. Oh, of course, yeah. Name your price. I want him barred! I want him barred from every club in the country! Bruce. Maurice. I'd like to join, please. I got the money. And I got the shoes. I appreciate the effort you've made, Mr. Flitcroft. But I'm sorry, I can't accept this. Why not? We have orders from Mr. Mackenzie. Mr. Mackenzie? Can I see that, please? Golf club membership is for amateurs only. As I entered the Open as a professional, I can't join a club? Correct. He accepts here that I'm professional, that's fine. Professionals can play on any course in the country. Yes. Great! Simply show them your Professional Golf Association certificate and away you go. But I don't have one, Bruce. There's no chance of me even getting one unless I belong to a club. Like I say, I'm sorry. I consider this action a gross betrayal of me rights as a human being. My human rights. Is the British Open, not by definition, 'open' to everyone? Furthermore... The British Open is indeed open to all golfers, providing they have achieved a standard fit for competing at a professional level. My mother plays golf, but would I want her eligible for the British Open? No. I certainly would not. Of course, I wouldn't want your mother to be eligible for the Men's British Open, but I would hope that you would consider her eligible for the Women's British Open. Don't you think? Good point. Ought I to add sexism to your list of crimes, Mr. Mackenzie? I like that a lot. I now consider the tone of your letters to be unbecoming to my office and will therefore cease replying to them as of this correspondence. "Mr. Mackenzie feels he has said all he has to say on this matter. Apart from to remind you that any unlawful entering of a golf club is, of course, trespassing." Flipping heck. You all right, what's that? Yeah, no. Don't worry. "He trusts this brings this matter to a close." You'll show them yet, love. Hm. Mmm. Just need to make them listen, that's all. We've come outside to the studio car park to meet the man who shot a world record of 121 at the British Open. He is the world's worst professional golfer. No, I'm sorry. I don't-- I don't agree with that. I'm not the world's worst golfer, and I'm willing to prove it. Okay, great. So we have set up a little golf course here in the car park. Yeah, it's not a golf course, it's a putting green. Great. It's exciting, isn't it? Oh, now, that was close! That was just a practice shot, you know, get the pace of the green. Yes, well, it has been raining out here, so it could be a little bit damp. Couldn't it? Oh! Now, you feel that you should be let back into the Open, is that right? Yes, an 'open' championship, you know, should be open to everyone. Uh, like the FA Cup, you know, give the little teams a chance. Oh! Now, bad luck. Uh, I think this ground is sloping. Well, uh, everybody does say that this car park is a bit lopsided, so... Well, I think I'd best hand back to the studio. Thank you to the fantastic Maurice Flitcroft. The world's worst golfer. No, I'm not the world's worst golfer. I don't agree with that. Oh-ho-ho, good shot, Maurice! Hey, it's really coming, innit? It's coming. "Practice is the road to perfection," you know. Oh! In here, love. Have I missed them? No, nothing yet. How was practice? Was great. Getting better all the time. Boys? We did it! We bloody did it! National champions! We're gonna make history. The world final's next! Oh, well done, lads! Oh! Well done! Where are the finals, love? Freaking France! You go have fun. I love you! They're gone. There. Now shall we celebrate too? Got some of that Babycham in the fridge. Yeah, we should celebrate. Yeah. I'll have a cup of tea, please, love. All right, love. Have to do some more practice later to work on me putting. Love. Don't be so hard on yourself. There was a slope in that car park. I could see it from here on the television. No. I don't know what happened. I got a bit nervous, maybe. Love? Got a bit of me migraine. I don't know. Oh... Hey. How d'you think that Mr. Jack Nicholson would have done, you know, taking up the golf at 50? Jack Nicholas? Yeah. No coaching, not one lesson, eh? Mm. And having to practice on a beach with a bloody retriever yapping at his ankles. You think he'd have done any better? No, it's a good point, love. But they still won't let me... Let me join, will they, so... There's no point in talking about it. That right? There's no point. All right. Hmm... Well... They might not let you in, but, uh... What about if you were to enter as someone else? Someone else? Yeah. Dashing Frenchman perhaps? Bonjour. Jean, you're a genius. Très chic. Bonjour. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome on the tee, from Paris, France, Gerard Hoppy. Okay, you've got this. Your practice has been sensational. No one will guess it's you, so just relax and bring it home, Maurice. Right. Again, don't call me Maurice. Ah, shit, sorry, Mol. Or Mol, I'm Gerard, Gerard Hoppy. Got you. That's a nice opening drive from the Frenchman, Gerard Hoppy. Yes! Unusual swing, but, uh, effective, it would seem. Good shot, Maurice. Gerard. Gerard, shit, sorry. Shot, Gerard! Merci beaucoup. Yeah! And that's a steady start for the Frenchman, Gerard Hoppy. He's parred the first two holes. I must confess I don't know much about this fellow, but he's a natty dresser, I'll give him that. This for a bogey for the Frenchman. And it's in! My goodness, he rattled that one in. Who is this Gerard Hoppy? I can't find him in the notes. I've never heard of him either. Merci. Merci. Keep an eye on him. Vive la France. And now, as the breeze gets up, we join Gerard Hoppy on the tenth tee. Still going well. Still going well in his first qualifier. Oh! And that's-- He's tweaked that left, and it's in the bunker. Right, it's just a bunker. Just remember your practice. You've done this loads of times, Mol. What? Oh, shit, sorry, Mol. I mean Gerard! Gerard. Shit! Gerard, Gerard. Come on! Hey, what's up, Maurice? Please, stop calling me Maurice. Oh, shit, I'm sorry, mate. It's Mackenzie, he's spotted us. Where? He's up there. No, no, no, he's behind us. Behind-- Don't look back! Don't look back! Mr. Flitcroft. Uh-- Oh, pardon, monsieur. Je m'appelle Gerard Hoppy, uh, merci beaucoup. Oh, come on, Maurice. I know it's you. Hey! Stay back, pal! No, this doesn't concern you. Come with us, please, Maurice. Hoppy, pardon, je ne comprends pas. Je m'appelle Gerard Hoppy. J'habite en Paris, France. Just going to the tee. Mr. Flitcroft, you look ridiculous in that wig. It's not a crime to wear a wig, is it? He's got one, look. Come on. All right, that's it. Here we go. This is Keith Mackenzie. I need police assistance on the tenth fairway. I've got two trespassers. Over. Police? You didn't tell me this was illegal, Maurice! The game's up, Maurice. Oh, Cliff, you berk. Right. Come on. Out of the way! Maurice! Come on! What are you doing? Come with me! Come on! I've got two trespassers coming your way. Arrest them both! Maurice! I repeat. Arrest them both! Maurice, come on! Two trespassers. One with a red shirt... What are you doing? ...and a hat, black hair. Get in! Hop in! Hop in! And now I'm hearing there's been an altercation with an official. And Gerard Hoppy, the Frenchman, I believe has commandeered a vehicle. Don't adjust the television, this isn't the Keystone Cops. This is actually happening. Oh no. What are we doing, Cliff? We're just making it worse. Stop! I don't know, Mol, but you'll be all right. I stole the clothes. They can't get you for that. You what? No, you-- You got them from your mate, down the market. There is no mate down the market. I nicked them. Whoa! Wait, wait! Whoa! Whoa! Shit. Flipping heck. Oh, Jesus. Go on, get out. I can't get caught, Mol. Oh, bloody... It's just a few clothes, Cliff. No, you don't understand. I done some things, I done some really bad things. I can't go back inside, not now. They'll throw away the key. Jesus Christ, what am I gonna do, Mol? Run. Just go before I change my mind. I never killed anyone, though. I swear. Don't believe everything they say about me, Mol. Gerard, I mean Gerard! Sorry! One's gone over the hill! Tossers! Mr. Flitcroft, stop! Stop right there! Mr. Flitcroft, stop running! Now, I am hearing news that Mr. Gerard Hoppy is not in fact Gerard Hoppy. I'm hearing it's Maurice Flitcroft. The so-called "Phantom of the Open." You wanted to see me, Mr. Hopkins? Now, Mike. I want to show you something. This time Maurice Flitcroft, a crane driver from Barrow, was arrested by police and is being held at Southport police station. The bail has been set at a thousand pounds. In other news-- We are in the middle of trying to secure the Trident deal. And we got your dad running around taking the piss out of me. I wouldn't take it personally, sir. Gerard Hoppy? Yeah, well, I can see what you mean, but-- We provide you with a nice life here, Mike. Nice clothes, nice house, nice car. Not bad for a little bastard from Bankside, eh? You gotta decide, Mike. You're either his sort or you're our sort. You can't be both. Mike! Mike! No need to shout, Maurice. No, I'm not. Hey, thanks, son! I'll pay you back straightaway. Don't worry about it, Dad. Road sweeper. Is that it? Your options are limited. Partly because of the, uh, incident. Mm. I'm sorry. Mm. Those are unusual flowers, you grow them yourself? No, I picked them on the way in. I shouldn't really, but... No, you should. Pick all the flowers you can, while you're still young. Oi, Maurice! Get back on that course! Don't let the bastards get you down! ...Middlesex beat champions Yorkshire. And there were wins for Somerset, Surrey and for Lancashire and Warwickshire, who meet in the Benson & Hedges final on Saturday. And finally, Joe Thornbush has entered for this week's British Open golf championship. But the organizers believe Mr. Thornbush may really be Maurice Flitcroft, the crane driver from Barrow who scored 121 in a qualifying round. Championship secretary have kept a sample of Mr. Flitcroft's handwriting just in case he applied again. That's the news this evening. From all of us, good night. Hiya. Oh, smells nice. Got another postcard from the boys, look. Look at that. Mochbar. Moscow. Moscow. Look at that. Dancing round the globe, drinking a lot of vodka. Lovely. Moscow! Postmark was from two months ago, mind. Two months ago? Mm-hm. What they been doing since then, I wonder? Don't know. Great! That's it then. Unbelievable. We really do enjoy our work here. We've been building the brand for, well, 15, 20 years and it-- Michael! Oi! We do think it's-- Oi! Hey, up! Who are they? Mr. Mustache. Uh, they're just... Don't worry, we don't know them. If you just keep coming with us. Michael! Keep-- Keep on coming. Mike! Excuse us. Excuse us. Michael? Who are these people? Well, they're my brothers. You're joking? You get rid of them. Yeah, I will. Make it back for the dinner. I know, I'll get rid of them quick. Sorry, one second. Mike works at a homeless charity part-time, and he's just-- Just a couple of escapees. Oh, I see. He'll be back in a minute. What you playing at? What are you two doing here? We went to the house but there was nobody there. Yeah, they had to move out. Move out? Yeah, it's not been great. Can we crash with you? No, you can't. Where we supposed to stay? I'll show you. What are we supposed to do? We've nowhere to go. It's the boys, Jean! These are yours, I believe. Come in, lads! Living in a caravan? Blimey, the whole family back together, would you believe it? I'll put heater on. You wanna sit down, love? You all right? It's fine. Well, what happened? We thought you were on tour, loves. It got canceled. Canceled? Yeah, crowds got less and less. No one turned up. Yeah, it was like one minute disco were alive, the next it were dead. Well, that's just, you know, circle of life sometimes, boys. Is that all you've got to say? Well, what do you expect us to say, Michael? Well, how about sorry? For what? Well, you should have made them get proper jobs. Well, they're living the dream. There's naught wrong with that. Well, it depends what the dream is. They're world champions! At what? Disco dancing? They may as well be world champions at tiddlywinks. Look at the state of them. "The Fantastic Flitcrofts"? The fantastic failures more like. They aimed for the stars. Yeah, and now they're in the gutter. Mike's right. Maybe if we'd had a different dad, we'd have done better and all. Reckon our dancing's about as useful as your golf, Dad. Boys. Maurice, what are you doing? You all right? Love? Love, where you going? Just going out for a moment. I'm all right. Right. You go and apologize to your dad. Now, please. But he's not my dad though, is he? How can you stand there and say that... after all that he's done for you? Hey, no, no. Everything I've done, I've done myself. He wanted me to be a flipping astronaut! He's made your life a misery. Enough. Mmm. When I was 17... I got... offered a job to join a theater company. Seven pound 50 a week. Dream come true. Whole life set up for me. What happened? I got pregnant. I wanted to keep you, Michael. No question in my mind about that. But, um... nobody supported me. Not my father, not my mother. Not my friends. I trained as a secretary off my own back. Set up the little theater by myself. I brought you up by myself. And... not a soul stood by my side for a single second. And then I met your father. So don't you tell me he's made my life a misery. He's made my life. He's made all our lives. Now... I'm going out there... to look for him. And I suggest you come and help me. I can't, Mom. I've got a dinner that-- Oh, okay, Michael. Well, never mind, it's your life. Come on now, boys. Maurice? Maurice? Jean? Oh. You all right, Pam? Hey, you've not seen Maurice, have you? No. No. But here, I've got some post for you. Oh. Thanks. Be bills. Postmark from America, look. Oh. Willie, look at this. Bloody hell. Yeah. Come on, we've gotta find him. Thanks, Pam. Dad? Maurice? Dad? Dad? Maurice? Mol? Maurice? Mol? Dad? There you are, look. There he is. We're sorry, Dad! Yeah! We're really, really sorry! Come down, love. They didn't mean it. None of them. No! They were right! The world's not an oyster. It's just a barnacle. I see that now. What are you talking about, you bloody fool? I raised your hopes too high, lads. I'm sorry. I should have known. I were just letting you down. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Why don't you come down and read this? We've got a plane to catch. Dear Mr. Flitcroft, my name is Terry Moore, and I am writing to you from Grand Rapids, Michigan. You won't be aware of this, but for ten years now, we've held the Maurice Flitcroft Trophy in your honor. It's a day when the members bring their families, and the worst score wins, not the best. Go. Such is the affection that our members have towards you and the trophy, we would like to invite you and your family over for the ten-year anniversary of the competition. Sorry, Mr. Flitcroft said he's not to be disturbed. Oh, all right. Well, uh, just make sure that he gets this, all right? Yeah, of course. Yeah. We'd like to offer your family first-class tickets, hotel accommodation and as many golf balls as you can lose. Maurice, we hope you'll accept our invitation and that you have a pleasant flight here. Yours, Terry Moore, president, Blythefield Country Club, Grand Rapids, Michigan. Maurice, I'm Terry Moore. Oh, hello, Terry. So glad you could make it over. Welcome to America. Pleased to meet you. Thanks very much for having us over. Ah-ah-ah! What-- What you doing? We're not finished. I thought she was taking it away. It's almost full. Sorry. Save some room for the desserts. Flitcroft, it's showtime. Okay, stay calm. Ah. To my office please. Thank you. Mike, come on. Mike. Finally, the moment we've all been waiting for. Maurice Flitcroft will tee off at his own tournament here at Grand Rapids. Thank you, Mr. Flitcroft. You have given us much to think about. Excuse us a moment. Excuse me, Mr. Flitcroft. We have just one question more. We were just wondering, are you related, by any chance, to Maurice Flitcroft, the crazy golfer? No, no, no. It's a-- That's a really common name around these parts. He has nothing to do with Michael. He's a different class of person. Yes. I am. He's my father. Maurice Flitcroft is my dad. An honor to meet you. We are big fan of your father. He's the only golfer who's worse than my boss. Yeah. Well, we're all big fans of Maurice 'round here. He used to work here, don't you know, eh? Can we meet your father? Would he play golf with us? Yeah, I think he'd like that a lot. Great. What a great opening drive. 220 yards, straight down the middle. Have they got the real Maurice Flitcroft? Whoa! Sorry! No, I think that's him. You okay? We're staying here, brother. Read my mind, mate. Yeah? Read my mind. Great dancers. You see, I'd just thrown away the junior club championship with a three putt from 15 feet. I went home, and I said to my dad, "That's it, I'm giving up golf." I went to my room, switched on the TV and saw Maurice Flitcroft hit four putts from 10 feet. I went downstairs and said to my dad, "I take it back. Maybe it wasn't so bad." Next year, I'll be playing at the U.S. Masters in Augusta for winning the U.S. Amateur Championship. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you, Maurice Flitcroft. "Practice is the road to perfection." Wonderful speech. Thank you. So, mm... Uh, go-- Golf is a game where you can play well and score poorly, or play poorly and score well. But-- But my game was never like that. Uh, I-- I played poorly, and I scored poorly as well. But, uh, if I can inspire just one person, like this very talented young man, well, that's a hole in one, isn't it? That makes the whole thing worthwhile. Good luck to you. And keep practicing. Good luck to you. Uh, s-so... uh, thank you. I'd like to thank Terry Moore and all the members of the club paying an enormous amount of money, I expect, to bring Jean and I and the family over here for this week. But whatever you paid, the airline still lost all our luggage, so thanks for the clothes as well. Well, there's so many people I want to thank while I'm up here. Uh, I'd like to thank my sons, James and Gene, the Fantastic Flitcrofts, who you saw dancing on the floor a little while ago. And I'd like to thank my son Mike. And I'd like to thank Lloyd Donovan, a journalist who's been documenting my ups and downs. But there's one person that-- Uh, that I've never thanked publicly. I don't-- Actually, I don't think I've ever even thanked her privately. Uh, so tonight, I'd very much like to thank me wife, Jean. If life were a cup of tea, my Jean is the sugar. Without it, it's unbearable, just chuck it away. But with it, it's like-- It's like heaven on earth. She... She's a magician, she is. She's a magician. She's the light of my life, and I don't know how I'd cope without her. I love her very, very much. Oh... To Jean. Ta, Dad. Ta. That's caviar, there. It is. Maurice. Champagne and caviar? Yeah. Travel the world? Yeah, travel the world, like I said. Yeah, just like you promised. Shame about the diamonds, but there you go. I'll forgive you that. Oh, that is a shame. Wait a minute. My heart. Oh, Jean, it's rattling some. Me old heart. Well, what's that? What have you done? Oh, Maurice... Come right out of my heart. Where'd you get that? Cliff sent it me from his mate down the market. So maybe don't wear it in public. It's beautiful. Thank you. I meant it. I know. Thank you. So, Maurice, any more goals, as far as golf is concerned? Oh, well, maybe Sports Personality of the Year. I'm surprised I haven't been nominated for that. Something going on there. There's a conspiracy against me. It's kind of not fair, is it? No, it's sport. It's all about sport, isn't it? I mean, for every winner of a tournament, there's 149 losers. Well, that's a wonderful way to leave the interview. Thanks. Maurice Flitcroft, the Phantom of the Open, thank you. Thank you. And cut. Thank you, Maurice. May I get my tea, now? Oh, my gosh, I forgot. Uh, can someone get Maurice his tea? I'll get it right away. Was it six sugars? Six. You know, a lot of pros here in the States, they get invited to play in the Open and they don't go. Why not? Well, uh, it's a long way, it's expensive. I got a buddy who's a pro up in Frenchmen's Creek in Florida. and he's not going because he doesn't like the weather in Scotland. Heh, can you believe that? Really? Oh, yeah. What's his name? Welcome, once again, to the first round of qualifying for the British Open. We got players here from all around the world. They've got Japanese, Australians, players from France, Germany, Spain, you name it. A very smooth-looking American there, I think. All coming to our little island, hoping to end up lifting that famous Claret Jug. Greenkeepers have been out in force today. The course is looking spectacular. So without further ado, let's get out on the course. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome on the tee, from Frenchman's Creek, Florida... ...Gene Pachecki. Come on, come on, come on. Jesus, come on. Isn't that Maurice Flitcroft? Well, Blythefield Country Club is in the midst of its 10th annual Flitcroft member-guest golf tournament, an event named after Maurice Flitcroft. Maurice Flitcroft, a crane driver from Barrow-- Do you wanna go on? Are you looking, maybe, at the Hall of Fame? The Hall of Fame, and back home, maybe Sportsman of the Year. You know, I'm surprised I've not been invited or nominated for that, Sports Personality of the Year. I mean, you know, there's something going on. You know, there's a conspiracy being waged against me. Just to explain to those who don't know much about golf, what you're gonna do now, is you're gonna putt, as if you were on a green, you're gonna aim for this thing. This is quite dramatic, isn't it? Oh, that was a nearly. Ah, not quite. A lot of pressure. Shouldn't speak when a golfer's about to putt. No, you shouldn't. Oh, sorry. Need practice shots to get used to the green. This is not going too well, is it? No, I think this floor's sloping. You know, a man of your stature and, uh, your accomplishments on a golf course, we can't leave you without some tips for duffers like myself. Person picking up a golf club for the first time, what would be your advice? My advice? Well... um, practice. That is the road to perfection. Regular practice.
