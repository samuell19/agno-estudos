Waiter. A Coke and a chicken salad please. Thank you. I beg your pardon. Do you have the time? - Eighteen minutes past six. I could have made a guess myself. If it's too much trouble to look at your watch, just say so. I have no need for such contrivances. He guessed correctly. I have twenty after. I'm a little fast. I can believe that. You always tell time without a watch? I once had a difference of opinion with a watchmaker. I have boycotted timepieces ever since. I couldn't be without this. It has great sentimental value. A gift from your fianc?e? A former fianc?e. My present fianc?e gave me this. As an engagement present. We're being married in a few days. A good catch for the right girl. Then you have seen him? But you couldn't. He hasn't left his compartment since we've been on the train. He sits there and looks out the window. Hour after hour. I don't know what he sees except .. Telephone poles and dirt and farms and more telephone poles. It bores me terribly. But don't think I have no appreciation of the Great Northwest, Mister .. Doctor Valonius. How do you? I'm Marie Kembar. The truth is, trains bore me. Nothing ever happens. Nothing to do except look out the window. It's so monotonous. You get on a train in one place. And the engine huffs and puffs and lets you off in another. It takes so much time. It wastes so much time. I find the trip particularly exciting. This is the first time I have travelled this route. The first time is always exciting. No matter what one does. We're approaching a curve at high speed. That nail file. The point is sharp. - So? You might hurt one of those pretty fingers. You're a doctor. I need some doctoring. The degree is honorary. I don't practice medicine. My poor finger. You told me this was the first time you had been over this route. How did you know we were approaching a curve? I warned you in time. I never listen to warnings. Besides, I'm glad it happened. Anything to break this monotony. I am too forceful. Perhaps I am too stubborn. To listen to warnings. When I do listen. In one ear. Out the other. That isn't good. I could tell you of a forceful woman. She knew what she wanted and .. Thought she knew how to get it. She sounds like me. She was warned of some danger? - Yes. She was on a train. She was warned to stay on it, but .. In one ear. Out the other. As the train pulled into the town of Clayburgh. It was after nine. "The station was deserted except for a man." "He was a man trying to lead a simple, happy life." "He found out that life was neither simple nor happy." "The girl." "The girl who was warned." "Made his life complicated and miserable." You can't ditch me like a common .. All aboard. "But she didn't have much opportunity to regret the unheeded warning." Did you miss the train, mister? What is the matter? Are you hurt? You're bleeding. You must have hurt yourself when you put that big bundle on the train. Gosh, it's sticky. You ought to see a doctor. Go to Doc Arnold. He lives up near the post office. There sure is a lot of blood. Maybe you'd better tie it up. Make a tourniquet. Michael. Michael. - Shush. My mother. She doesn't want me to come down and watch the trains at night. Don't say anything. Come here. Let's hide in here. Why did you put that bundle on the back of the train? The baggage car is for bundles. The back of the train is for people. Michael. I will fix you. She never lets me alone for a minute. Always worrying something is going to happen to me. I'm too big to be treated like a baby. She's always telling me how I'll be carried home with a broken. I'd better get home before she does. Sorry I can't help with the tourniquet. Go and see Doc Arnold. Bye. Hey. Hey, fellah. The bridge is washed out up ahead. You can't get through that way. Hop in. Maybe we can get through on 77. River overflowing all the way up to Portland. Snow. Mighty pretty in the wintertime. Especially around Christmas. Then comes along the spring thaw and rain. There ain't nothing pretty about that. Going far? No. Not far. Lucky thing for you I came along. I had to cover the news about the bridge. Otherwise I'd have been in bed long before now. The Clayburgh Bulletin. I'm the reporter, publisher and editor. A one-man organisation. McFee. Dunlap. Dunlap? Dunlap? No. Don't know any Dunlaps. Going north? Yeah. Crazy. More snow coming. If I had my way I'd go south. Yeah. You read a lot about fellows getting picked up at night nowadays. First thing, they knock the driver over the head. And take his money and his car. Away they go. Hey. Wake up. How far have we gone? I don't know. Didn't know if we were still on 77. We weren't on 77 at all. This is Clayburgh. There were some roads washed out so I just turned around and kept on driving. I should have stayed awake and drove myself. I can't get used to staying up late. I've got enough news about the flood anyway. Staying here? You can't go anywhere else. - Where is the hotel? Hotel? Get in. Tell Mrs Mitchell, McFee sent you. An old friend. Thanks for the lift. - It didn't get you very far. You'll get tomorrow alright maybe. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Yes? Mr McFee said you had a room. I have a room. But it's not for rent. I'm sorry. McFee said .. - You want to see Mrs Mitchell. Maybe she has a room. Come on in. Aunt Thelma. Did you get washed out by the river? Yeah. This town is washed out any way you look at it. Aunt Thelma, can you come here a minute? I haven't got a cold. - Coming. Ruth. He hasn't sneezed once. Don't you think he should just go to bed? I'm not going to have a sick boy on my hands. Oh, no you don't. Stay here and have your throat sprayed. Open. It tickles. You stay here or get what I promised you for sneaking out to watch the trains. I did not. You tell lies now and you will grow up to be a bandit. If you didn't go to the railroad station where were you? Alright. I won't do anything until I have proof. If you've been lying, oh boy will you get it. This man said McFee sent him for a room. He is washed out. - Ah, that's too bad. But if you're a friend of McFee's, I guess we can find a room for you. This is Mrs Mitchell. Dunlap. Harold Dunlap. - How do you do? I'm Jean Maxwell. - Hello. Now, where in the world will I put you? Well, goodnight. I am going to bed. To read. Goodnight, darling. I know, Just go upstairs. First door to the left. And take a towel out of the linen closet. Just keep opening doors until you find it. It's there somewhere. My goodness. You must get out of those wet clothes or Ruth will have you under vapours too. Come down later for a cup of tea. My goodness, you .. you won't have anything to come down in. I'll get you a pair of Willy's work pants. They'll fit you and he won't mind. He's out now piling up sandbags at the river. Are you still here? I told you to go to bed. I'm gone. Good heavens. I have put Mr Dunlap in Mike's room. Well, they'll just have to share it. But there's only a single bed. Where's Mike going to sleep? On the floor? They'll get along alright. I'll put up a cot. Oh boy. A cot. I'll tell Mr Dunlap. - I'll carry the tea. Thank you. [ Door knocks ] Mr Dunlap. Mr Dunlap. I can see someone in there. Mr Dunlap. I brought some hot tea for you. Thanks very much. But I changed my mind. Thanks just the same. I've got a terrible headache. I just need some sleep. That's all. Yes. Of course. Sleep is good for headaches. And take an aspirin. You'll feel better in the morning. Would you have some tea? Mr Dunlap has a headache. I don't think Mike minds sleeping on the sofa. Would you Mike? I'd like it. It's really quite comfortable. I have slept there often myself. I will get the bedding. Who is there? Have a can of beer and go back to sleep. What do you want to do, wake up the whole house? What have you got, Willy? - Barney, shush. Beer? Some years ago when the river overflowed I caught a case of bourbon floating by. I didn't see none of it. Not even a cork. You stingy old nincompoop. Give me a can of beer. I won't give you nothing. Just a measly can. I ain't going to give you nothing. This ain't good enough for you. You go and get yourself a case of bourbon and hide it good. You know I had to hide it. Mrs Mitchell disapproves of drinking on the premises. She doesn't, huh? Well, listen. If we want a can of beer who's going to stop us? Besides. Mrs Mitchell and me is just like .. Just .. just like that. Yes, sir. And anything I want to do .. I do. Now, for instance. If I wanted to get myself a cold piece of chicken. From the refrigerator. The icebox. I take it. Whenever I want to do something. It's okay. You know. You know, she knows that if I'm not treated well around here I'll move. Just like that. Ah, give me that. You only to know how to pull corks out of bourbon bottles. This is a man-sized job. Do you want to know something? I can twist the old girl around my little bitsy finger. You want to know how? - How? Flatter her. Tell her she is beautiful. Can't you use flattery without being a big liar? Look, Bud. When you tell a woman that is over forty that she is beautiful .. You ain't a liar. You are a .. philanthropist. I know how to handle women. Nothing to it. And don't interrupt. Women are women. Mrs Mitchell. Yes. Mrs Mitchell too. I've boarded here so long I practically own the place. Alright. Go ahead. Have a can. I think I've had enough already. Ahem. - Shush. Did you get that way falling into the river? No, Miss Mitchell. Well, we just had one each. And .. we got a lot left over. Try one. What? Oh. We really worked hard. Mrs Mitchell. The river is up two feet more than it was. Gosh. It's awful. Oh, it's really terrible. Kinda like a nightmare. Ha. Alright, Willy. Go to bed. He's gone. Mike. He's gone. Shush, Ruth. You'll waken everybody. Mike's not on the sofa. His clothes are gone. He'll get himself drowned. I know. He'll get drowned. Sorry Mr Dunlap to waken you, but Ruth's boy has gone off. He does it all the time. - Please, Mr Dunlap. Help me find him. I just know he'll be drowned if we don't find him. Yes. I'll help you find him. - He went to the river. I'll go along. No. You'd better stay here. I'll bring him back. But you've never seen him, Mr Dunlap. There's not many boys out this time of night. He's a tall boy with freckles and spaces between his front teeth. He's handsome except for that. - I'll find him. If he's drowned himself it will be my fault. Won't you need a coat? No. Here, pussy. Kitty. Come on, Kitty. Kitty, Kitty. Here, Kitty. Here, Kitty. You scared me. You scared me. I thought you were the cat. Going down by the river? You look like someone. Everyone looks like someone. Yeah. I'm going down the river. Want to come with me? Come on. We can watch it together. You may not get another chance to see the river overflowing. It's pretty exciting. Well. Come on. - Okay. You are walking too fast. Wait for me. Mike. So there you are. That awful cat scared the life out of me. I found him. He was starting home anyway. Mickey. - What you hit me for? I just went for a walk. Just a walk? You'll find it hard walking or sitting when I get through with you. Thank you for finding him, Mr Dunlap. This is my son. Well, come on. Luckily, Mr Dunlap found him before he fell in the river. Two minutes more and he'd have been through the park. The boy is always disappearing. Where is he now? Where were you? I changed in the bathroom like you told me. Come on, Mike. Get to bed. We are ready. One little misstep and you would fall out the window. What is the matter with you? Tired of living? What is this? Popcorn in a noiseless bag so I won't keep him awake. Get to bed. His father used to eat crackers. Goodnight. - Goodnight. And don't get out of bed until morning. You'll keep an eye on him? - He'll be alright. How can you keep an eye on me if you're asleep? Now, listen. - Come on, Ruth. Goodnight, Mr Dunlap. Goodnight. Are you asleep? Not yet. I don't like to sleep. Boy. Think of all the things I could be doing right now. If it wasn't for my mother. She doesn't let me have any fun. Like watching the trains down at the station. You know. You look like someone I saw there tonight. You won't tell my mother I was at the station? That I'd slipped out? I wasn't at the station. Anyway. You know I was. If my mother knew I wouldn't get my allowance for six months. I'd get a walloping too. I don't like being walloped. Gee. Trains are wonderful. Especially at night. They are like big, long snakes. With lighted skins. And they whistle and smoke and rattle. Boy, they are something. What was it you saw at the station? Just a man. He put a bundle or something on the train. And I guess he hurt his arm. He must have cut it. Is that why you watched me take my shirt off? I was just wondering. Not many people come to Clayburgh. And you're the only stranger. I mean person, who is new around here. Still want to see my arm? Nah. It wouldn't make any difference anyway. Even if you were the same man. Come here. I wasn't anywhere near the station tonight. I hitched a ride to Clayburgh. Remember that. Sure. But nobody .. - Look. Not a scratch on it. Nothing on that one either. Yeah, fine. But I wasn't trying .. - I never travel on trains. I like to watch them but not ride in them. I don't even know where the station is. - Yeah. There is nothing wrong with being there. Unless there's someone like my mother who doesn't want you to go. The first time we saw each other was in the park. Sure. In the park. Yeah. And it was lucky you found me before my mother did. You saved me from a shellacking. I'm sure lucky you came to Clayburgh. Say. Why don't we sneak out now and go down by the river? Okay. I was getting sleepy anyway. Goodnight. - Goodnight. What is your name? Harold. Goodnight Harold. This friend McFee sent over had an appetite like a horse. I hope this one doesn't have a too-long reach. Well, if he has I am going to sit next to him. Here is Mr Dunlap now. Good morning. - Good morning. Hi, Harold. - Hello, Mike. That bed was so comfortable I overslept. - That's good. Mr Dunlap, this is Ruth Bennett. We met last night. Yes. And this is my niece, Jean. We met last night too. - That's right. A jolly good morning to you. And this is Barney. - Pleased to meet you. And Willy. Won't you sit down? Say. Ain't them my pants and shirt you are wearing? Well, yes. My things were wet. - I loaned them to him, Willy. I'll buy them from you. How much? - $4.50. Willy. Five years ago when you bought them you only paid $3.50. Prices have gone up. Okay. Two bucks. Give him a dollar. Sold. Where you from? North. - North? Greenfield? Landsdowne? Barton? Helmville? Barton. Barton? I used to work in the post office in Barton. I knew every street and alley by heart. Where did you live? I didn't live there very long. It was .. On Orchard Street. Orchard Street? Orchard Street. Of course. Down near the paper mill? I am full. Can I go out now? You go out on the porch and stay on the porch. If you put one foot .. Okay. Okay, Ma. I'll stay right on the porch. I won't even put one toe off it. Close the windows. They're coming up to the door. Hi, McFee. Well, if it isn't little Lord Fauntleroy's bad brother. Good morning, McFee. Morning. Morning. Come in. Sit down. The morning bulletin is here. Quite. You're late for tea. The coffee is lukewarm. Just the way I like it. Morning. Morning, sweetheart. Hiya, Westbrook. Don't call me that. Hi. I didn't steer you wrong, did I? - No. Thanks very much. Could not have done better anywhere. What about the flood? Not any worse, I hope. Same. The bridge is out. They tried to put up a pontoon affair but it didn't last long. You will be able to get out around dinnertime. The trains can't get through either. A bad thing happened on the Limited last night. Another wreck? I knew the Limited would do something like that. I've warned Michael a hundred times. Calm down. Calm down. Nothing was wrecked. Except a girl. That can happen to anybody. This magazine is full of things like that. Got it over the wire this morning. Some girl got herself killed on the Limited. They found her on the rear platform. A nail file. Like that. Right through the heart. Did somebody do her in? - They weren't cleaning her nails. What had happened? Don't know yet. Somewhere up around Seattle they found the body. Michael should hear about this. Maybe this will stop him from running down to that railroad station. Mrs Bennett. Mrs Bennett. Let me tell him. Mike and I got pretty friendly last night. There's no sense in scaring the boy. He should be scared. I'm scared when he's out alone, heaven knows where. If scaring will scare him, he should be scared. I'll tell him. I think he will behave himself. You don't know that boy very well, do you. Full of mischief. Needs some discipline. That's what he needs alright. He needs a father. I got to go. - Wait for me. Nice to meet you, Dunlap. I'll give him a good talking to. Just like a big brother. Make sure you scare him. A very sweet man. Very sweet. Take it easy, dearie. He offered to be Mike's big brother. Not his father. I will just ignore that remark. Hello Mike. - Hi. Mike. Your mother is on the warpath. That's nothing new. I just thought I'd tell you. You had better hide for a while. What have I done now? Holy cow. She's always after me for something. She will calm down but maybe you had better beat it. No. That would make her madder. She'll get over it. Don't worry. But not if she sees you now. I had better stay right here on the porch. Okay. Do what you like. Stay here. I don't like staying here. If you don't like it don't do it. Listen I bet you know lots of places where you can have more fun than .. Sitting here twiddling your fingers. Sure. I know a lot of places. Down by the river. Or near the railroad tracks. Or the park. Gosh. I sure would like to shinny up one of them big trees. I could see the whole town. And the tracks and the river and everything. From the top of a tree. Why don't you go? My mother would find out. She's got something magic about her. The way she finds out everything. Yeah. But she'll cool off later. Sometimes she boils for days. Here. You get yourself something you want for dinner. Lots of candy. Anything you like. No. I would really catch it. I think your mother found out about the station. Did you tell her? - Of course not. Thanks. You're a pal. Stay away until after dinner. - Okay. I'll do the same for you someday. - Okay, Mike. You make the best coffee this side of Brazil, Thelma. Sorry, McFee. The pot is empty. In that case I'll run along back to the shop. You could not have done a good job that quickly. That boy of yours won't go near the trains again. I gave it to him good. Here, let me take these. Thank you. You're going to spoil things around here for me, young fellow. I've a mind to go and work on the bridge myself to get you out of here faster. I wish you would. I've got to leave today. Maybe you can. If I hear anything I'll call you. Bye, all. Goodbye, McFee. See you later. Jean, what's happened to you? I just don't like to do things that are expected of me. That's all. I can do them myself when I'm in the mood. The nicest thing I ever heard. I won't say another word. I'll catch up on my book. What book are you reading? None. But I have read so many. And they seem so easy. I decided to write one myself. You wash. I'll dry. I didn't think you were the type. I'm not. How could you tell? If you're going to dry, dry. Maybe you are the type. You were right the first time. Where are you from? Look. If you want to dry I'll call you when I'm done washing. You won't have to call me. I'll be right here. I don't really care where you're from. But I wonder where you're going. I'm just going. And the sooner the better. You aren't going to some little hick town like this I hope. You know, I'm a poor little orphan girl myself. From San Francisco. I'd have stayed there if I'd had any money. Ever tried working? Yeah. I tried it. I used to know a girl like you. The only work she ever did was working some guy for all he had. She spent every dollar he ever made. Lucky girl. Every man I ever met was ruined before I could get him. I don't get any breaks at all. You are different. The same as all the others. Only you will admit it. A girl is a girl. I talk like I am wised up. The truth is I'm this way because of some guy. It all happened two and a half long years ago. I guess I'm about over it by now. I was sweet and gay and we were madly in love. The sun shined every day but the moon blotted it out. Then one day I found a note. 'Darling, this is goodbye. I am going back'. 'To my wife'. The jerk was married. I didn't know. Tough. What's with you now? We're all friends. Tell me all. Who, what .. Why are you running away? The girl you used to know. The one you said was like me. She spent all your dollars? Yeah. She spent all my dollars. I didn't care. Then one day I found out a few things. A switch. She was married and she left you a note. No. She wanted to marry me. I loved her. I don't know why. It happened. Everything was fine and then just a few days ago. I found out she was supporting some other guy. You just ditched her, huh? I ditched her. That dame on the train that McFee mentioned. She got it good. Paid for a lot of others. I wonder what she did to deserve such a happy end. How she took some guy like you over the coals and he didn't like it. You're very pretty. When your lips aren't moving. Why don't we try that again sometime? Without the talk. You are well-off now. Don't look for trouble. Excuse me. I forgot the beers I brought home last night. Nobody likes the stuff but me. I may as well take it down to the place with me. Nobody will be in for gas. Nothing to do. You know. Don't apologise, Willy. If you want your beer, take it. Have a can? - No thank you. That's enough. But a friend might drop in. I know. You don't care who you share your beer with. Last night I heard you offered some to Mike. I didn't know what I was doing. What's the matter with that kid anyway? I saw him outside and .. I told him what I heard on the radio and he acted like I chased him with a gun. What did you hear, Bill? The news. About that girl that was murdered on the train last night. The police up in Seattle think she was murdered between here and Landsdowne. You sure you won't have a can? Excuse me again. I don't see why anyone thinks they can tell my son he can go for a walk. Since when has anyone had to tell him? When he wants to go he goes. I warned him not to put one foot off the porch. Yes. But you didn't say anything about both feet. Yeah? Is that Jean? Sweetheart. McFee. Mike is here. He's a nuisance. He'll break something if he hangs around here. Oh, cut it out. You were a boy once yourself, McFee. Why not let him help you run your press? After all, somebody has to take over when you get old and fat. Alright. Alright. I'll keep him here until dinnertime. Am I invited to dinner? Okay. Listen. The road is still washed out. Tell that man. Goodbye. If you're thinking things, think them. If you've got something to say, say it. Feel like a game of checkers? I just knew you were a checkers fiend. There's something about you that gives you away. Which do you want, red or black? You can't play standing up. Ladies first. Well. It's your move. I'll move this one for you. Though I'm bound to win this way. Playing against myself. Don't kid yourself. That is the best way to lose. Fight yourself and the part wins doesn't count. That's the part that loses. I've a short memory. One time I lose. The next time I win. It sort-of balances the books. You know, you've been in burgh less than a full day. I've been here two and a half years. Question. Which one of us is more anxious to leave? You? Me, or both of us? You know, I tried working once. I could maybe try it again. That's a real nice thought. Real nice. I could get my old job back in San Francisco. Fine. Why don't you? I've never seen the Golden Gate. When you get there send me a picture postcard. Where will I send it? - Are you really going? That all depends on you. Don't depend on me, honey. Not me. Harold. I've been doing some thinking. Without even trying. You'd better do some thinking too. She's just covering up for him. That's all. If she told him he could go, what right has she to do so? I told Mike he could go. Not Jean. You told him? Why didn't you say so? Has he come back yet? No. But .. If you sent him somewhere, I guess it is alright. I didn't send him anywhere. I just told him he could go. I shouldn't have. You're very right to be strict with him. Why, he is liable to go down to the river. Maybe hurt himself. He might even have fallen in deep water. I worry too much. He has always come right back until now. He'll be alright. Would you like to try a game of checkers? No thanks. I've tried one. Carol. McFee just called. Mike is with him. They will be home for dinner. Don't tell me. Oh no. I'm only his mother. Been thinking? All done. Wait a minute. The roads are still washed out. So, they're washed out? The bridge is still down too. It takes more than a day to build another one. Look. If you go, where are you going to go? You got to stay here. You've got nothing to run away from. Except me. You haven't touched your dinner, Michael. I'm not hungry, Ma. Alright. Don't eat unless you want to. Though Harold doesn't seem to be hungry either. No-one has to eat unless they want to. How is the flood, Mr McFee? It's fine. It still is a promising job for the Red Cross. Any more news about the girl who had her heart manicured? No. No new developments. They figured she was killed about five hours out of Seattle. Somewhere near Landsdowne. Maybe even right here in Clayburgh. The trouble is. No-one got off the train at Landsdowne. Or here. And she must have got off the train. Because the soles of her shoes were wet. No-one else on the train had wet soles on their shoes. So the police are stuck. No-one saw her get off, huh? - No. And what is more important is .. No-one saw anyone else leave the train. And that 'anyone else' .. Is the one that done the killing. Ma. Now, Michael. We aren't going to talk anymore about trains. I'm trying a new method with you. You do whatever you like, just so you tell me beforehand. We're starting a new slate. But Ma. Last night at the station .. What happened? What's the matter, boy? Is he hurt? I tripped. - Easy boy. I'd better call Dr Arnold. No. That's alright. I'll be alright. - Want a shot of whiskey? My ankle. I think I've sprained it. Can you help me upstairs? - I'll go up and fix the bed. Sure, we'll get you upstairs okay, son. Take it easy now. That's it. Give me your arm. Yeah. That's sprained. Hey, Mike. Come upstairs and keep me company. I want to stay down here. Always contrary. Come on. Just hold on. There you go. Take it easy now. There you are. Almost there. Easy does it. I hope you feel better. - Thanks. It ain't swollen yet. Better have it wrapped up tight. Here he is. Hiya. Michael will help me bandage it. Thanks, McFee. Not at all. You stay right here and keep Mr Dunlap company. Time for bed anyway. You were up so late last night. I want to go down with you. You big baby. What's come over you? I'll get you something to use for a bandage. Mike will help me. Thanks very much, Mrs Bennett. - You're welcome. If you need anything, Mike will get it for you. What's the matter, Mike? Are you mad about something? - No. What's wrong? - Nothing. I'd just like to go downstairs. Well, if you want to tell anybody anything. Call them up here. I'd like a chance to hear about it too. You're not sure, Mike. Know how it feels when your mother thinks you did a thing when you didn't? You should have some proof. I saw you put that girl on the train. There was blood on your sleeve. I wasn't cut. The girl was. Besides. Where is your suit? Show me the suit if it wasn't you. Is that all? Here. I'll get it for you. Let me lean on your shoulder. What's going on up there? That fellow Harold probably hopping around on one leg. Mrs Bennett. Mrs Mitchell. Come up here quick. Mike ran out the back way. I couldn't stop him. My ankle. - Where did he go? He said he was going down to the park to shinny a tree. So he can see what's happening on the river. I said it was dark and he might fall and hurt himself. Before I could stop him he ran off. There's no controlling that boy. You'd better get back into bed. Put your arm on my shoulder. I'll be alright. But you'd better look for Mike too. Everyone should look for him. Before it's too late. My goodness. Oh yes. You are right. McFee. Mike has run off. Not again? Please help me find him. He may fall out of a tree. What is he doing in a tree? Alright. Let's go find the boy. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's the big idea? I was winning. Come on, let's go to the park. We'll try there first. Willy. Willy, he may be just loitering on the streets. You go down to the station. What is this, a posse? Okay. Jean. You stay here and take care of Harold. We won't be long. I hope. That was a pretty clumsy job of faking an accident. Why did you do it? I like to be alone occasionally. But you aren't alone, darling. You've got me. Why did you pull that sprained-ankle stunt? I told you why. - Alright. Forget it. I'll guess. It could be you wanted me to nurse you instead of Mike. Is that why you let him run off again? Yeah. I did want to be alone with you for a few minutes. It would have been so simple. All you had to do was walk to my room. If it was empty, you could have waited. You're not dumb, Harold. I'm not dumb either. Something is brewing. Are you planning to leave? How can I? Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink. That's why you're all dressed for bed. In your suit. I was going to go out and look for Mike. That's a pretty good reason for changing your clothes. Would you like to try again? I don't suppose you heard the news. In about half an hour the highway is going to be open. Oh? - Hmm. A couple of men with badges and notebooks .. And handcuffs, are coming here. There's talk of the state police. You know, I'm a little more suspicious than these .. Home-grown small-towners. You did something. And I think I know what it is. All my life I've been attracted to the wrong kind of guy. If you are thinking of leaving, forget it. You're going to stay right here in Clayburgh for the time being. For me. No-one saw you get on or off the train. You are a free man. Well. Did anyone see you? Who saw you? If they can identify you, you're finished. Mike. So he is the one? He saw you get off the train. What have you done to him? - Nothing much yet. There must be something. Some other way. He will talk. That's what I thought. I don't know what goes on in your mind but you can't touch him. Do you hear? Some women get what they're looking for. But you can't kill a kid. You are pretty awful. You're even too bad for me. I don't know what you are planning to do but I won't let you do it. You are very pretty. When those lips aren't moving. Mike. Come back. It sounds like it came from over there. Wait. Hey, Dunlap. Was that you yelling 'come back'? Yep. Did you see him? That's him. You can run faster than I can. I got good news for you. The road is open. Michael! Harold just ran after Mike. We got him spotted. I'm glad somebody is able to run. Did you say Harold ran after Mike? Like a deer. When I was young I used to .. - But Harold's ankle is sprained. He couldn't even walk to his room. Ruth. Ruth. You poor darling. You poor baby. Who did this to you? Wait a minute. There. Darling, everything is going to be alright. He tied .. He tied me up. - Now, now. Calm down, Michael. He is coming after me. Let me go. He will kill me. Nobody is going to hurt you. - Michael. I'll give you the beating of your life for this. Can't you see the boy is frightened? He should be. When I get through with him .. Tell me. Who was trying to kill you? - I didn't say I was going to kill him. Keep out of this. Mind your own business, Thelma. Shut up. Michael, come on. Tell me. She'll hit me if I tell. She won't lay a hand on you. I promise you that. That night at the station. So .. you were at the station. Yes, dear. Go on. You won't hit me? We'll see. I saw Harold. Kill that girl. He knows. I saw him dump her on the train. He tried to kill me. Good heavens. And he's here in the park. Let's see. How can a big man like you move so quietly? Rubber heels. I see you found Mike. I couldn't catch up with Harold. He was running like blazes. Harold. The killer. Something might have happened to you. - I won't go out again, Ma. The killer? Tell me something quick. What is going on? I am the newspaper. - Come on, McFee. I know. But tell me something. All my readers depend on it. The bulletin for the latest news. Come on. I'll tell you on the way home. - I know, but .. Did you forget something? No. Not a thing. Mike is alright. The road is open. Not for me. You're not leaving? No. I'm tired of running. You know. You and me. Yeah. We might have been alright together. If she had stayed on the train. She would be alive and I would be a free man. Those cops from Seattle. They should be here soon. They'll be here. Quite a story. We're going to stop soon. Don't get off. Clayburgh. All aboard. ..w-g..
