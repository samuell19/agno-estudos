MOSFILM I will answer your question! Here comes Santa Claus. Hey, come up! Hey! Whoa! Santa speaking. What Santa? Santa Claus, of course! We already got 10 addresses. Are you nuts? Well, ok, what's the address? Remember it. 3rd Builders street, 25. What's the apartment number? Thirteen. - Thirteen. - Yes Ok, I'll do my best but no guarantees. Santa Claus risks missing New Year because of this traffic. Miles of cars, even the widest highways hardly move. Moscow traffic stands firmly, Yekaterinburg barely moves, too... And here are some shots from Nizhny Novgorod. No difference at all. Every year on 31st of December we go to Russian baths, and every new year your father... - ... every new year he is late. - And you know why? As he says, he feels himself lost. - But do you know what was lost? - What? Ahaa... listen then. Before your birth we accidentally sent him to Leningrad... instead of me. - And he fell in love there. - With whom? But he got married your charming mom and, unfortunately they divorced quite quickly because he still loved the one from Leningrad. Did you buy a New Year present for your father? - I did. A cell phone. -What? - A cell phone - You know what would be a real present for him? - What? First, you drink. Uncle Pasha, you know I can't drink. I don't offer you to drink, just have a drink to your father. Uncle Pasha, you know what happens when I drink. Do you love your father? - Daddy? - Daddy. - I do. - Pass it, please Drink it and we'll teach you how to make your father happy. Take it. Hey! Hey! THE IRONY OF FATE THE SEQUEL Doesn't work? What's that? A deodorant? A deodorant? Idiot! Idiots! - Yes. - I said, sit down. Sit! - What? - Water. - Hey, did you forget about me? You alcoholic! - Didn't get you. - It's not about you. There's nothing to take here. Listen, here is a man in my apartment! Either a thief or a homeless. I don't know yet. You are homeless! I'm not! Give me water. I said, sit down! I'm already here. Why did you open the windows? Oh, I see you. Oh, there's someone else? So you don't work alone? Help! - What floor? -4th, please. Here you are. - Where is he? - There. Well, what we've got here? - Oh! What a nice guy! - Seems like he didn't take anything. Yeah? Thanks God. Hello, Vladik! Hello, but I'm not Vladik! I did, I did. Call me a bit later, ok? Yes. Bye! Get up! Quickly! You hear me? - Are you talking to me? - Yes, I'm talking to you now. - I just thought... No, I'm talking to you. Irakly, just let me call the police. Don't call. We'll manage ourselves. Irakly? - Yes. Is it his clothes? - Are you Irakly? I thought Iraklys are a bit others. Well, like this. - Shhh. Look, phone's like yours. - Hey! Why are you picking my pockets? Don't touch it! Where are you going? - Oh, Roman Yevgenievich. - I'm not Roman Yevgenievich. - Hello. Thank you. You, too. No, Lev Sergeyevich is on Bahamas Yes, of course, I'll tell him. Yes, say hello to your wife. He arrived by air 1,5 hour ago from Moscow. - Who? Lev Yevgenievich? - Why? Why you ask me? You better ask him, darling. - Hi, Tolik! How are you? - I'm bad. But I'm not Tolik, you... Tolik, there are some problems with tenants on Perspektivnaya street, take Vlad and go there. Perspektivnaya? Where's is that? Are you in Egypt? Who let you in? I'm not in Egypt, I'm at home. - Come on, come on, swim. - Lukashin Konstantin Yevgenievich. Here! Finally, that's me. 3rd Builders street, 13. - Didn't get it. - What? Wrong address? Things happen. - Moscow. - Of course, Moscow! He came to Saint Petersburg, got drunk and now he thinks he's at home? Deport him out to the frost. - Don't! I don't want out to the frost. - Well, my friend... - I want to drink. - Did you wash you head with vodka? Come on, get up. What? I want to drink. And... not to drink the opposite. Nadia, give him his pants. - Please - Thank you - Don't. To the right. - I know. Turn on the light, passenger. Yeah, things happen. Nadia, where's your mom? She's at her friends helping to cook and then she was going to a store. - Is she going to be here by midnight? - Of course. - Honestly, it would be better to gather at my place, it's too small here. - Stop it, there will be only three of us. - And dad? - Dad never celebrates New Year, for some reason he doesn't like this event. That's a pity. I wanted it to be a family circle - dad, mom, you and me. What are you planning? I... I... Wow! Super! It feats you so well! Why did you move the furniture? We changed the houses. Look into the window. Yeah? What's the reason to touch the houses? No, it's all ok. There's the school, I finished it, there's the kindergarten that I didn't get it - there was no place. Wait, wait. Where is the church? Where is it? There? - What? Am I in Leningrad? - Thank God. Hush! Hush. But how?! Lukashin, Zhenka! Zhenka Lukashin! Finally! Where's Kostya? - Kostya? - Yes. - He left. - Where? You should think logically. There's no Kostya here? - There's no. - There are two variants he left, or he hasn't come yet. You think it's very witty? Joking, joking. Kostya called, apologized a lot, he is in Leningrad. - Where? - In Leningrad. - Stop, stop calling. - I'm calling Kostya. Kostya-Kostya! Remember your youth. Would you be glad to get my call when you are with a girl? - Where am I with a girl? - Where? In Leningrad. What Leningrad? There's no such city! There's no city but the 3rd Builders street is still there. How did he get there? How did I get here? By the way, how did he get here? - I don't know. - I don't know either. Wait! How did you drag me in? - Why are you...? - Let me try. - Doesn't fit. - Really? Let me try. How did he get in? - Wait, I think I got it. I asked auntie Olya to clean here a bit - What auntie Olya? Our neighbor. - She doesn't know you, so she let him in. - Hi. Already drinking? I'm at my girlfriend's place. I've got only one, unlike someone. She sends you greeting, too. And waives. Rifatov sends you his greetings. I didn't send him greeting and I didn't waive. - No, you did, in your soul. I discerned it. - Wait! Let's assume we know how I got in. But how did you get in? Come on, come on. Wait! The last request! - Shoot you down? - No, a cup of coffee. - Chew some snow. - Irakly. - Ok, give him some coffee and let him get lost. - Oh, thank you. Call mom about dad, please. My father and I celebrate every New Year birthday together. You'd better hurry up or you'll miss New Year with your father. I lost my cell phone. Where's my cell? Can I use yours? I can't find mine. - Here. - Thanks. - You are welcome One second. - It rings in your pocket. - Oh, exactly. Thank you. - You are welcome - I just take it of. Hello, Lev Sergeyevich. Yes. Don't! Happy New Year. How's the water? Don't take it off. Yes, no, there's no problem at all. Hello, Lev Sergeyevich, hello. Bad connection... No, we'll solve this ourselves. We are not going to bother you with this. Yes. Yes. We decided to invite father. Are you ok with this? Ok, mom, can you call him yourself? And one more thing, mom, I'm out of time, can you come faster? Of course, Lev Sergeyevich, don't worry. At the very outside I'll go there myself. Don't worry, have a good rest. Thank you Vladik! I asked you to call me back! Nadya, make me coffee. No, from a normal cup, I'm not at work now. Come on, honey. Ok, forget. I'm explaining. There is a building of Perspektivnaya street with our station. The tenants filed a complaint saying that because of it their TVs don't work well anymore. Yes, it happens.

Of course, he's rich. It's easier to love rich men. I advise you to have a mercenary marriage. It's easier to divorce. Oh, yes? So you think it's better to love poor and sick? Are you talking about me? Where's my passport? Listen, I don't know where's your passport. I gave it to you. Ok. Look, what I've got. God! Are you making fun of me? Stop taking your things out.

You've already decided it. It's not true. She didn't say it, but she gave me to understand it. - I don't understand why you need me, - So I've got a weighty reason to ask you... You've already taken the decision and haven't found a minute to meet me before. - Yes, Ipollit Georgiyevich. I tried, but... - But now... - Thank you - How many Frontier Guard holidays a year? - But will you come to the wedding? - Thank you for the invitation, but...

What for, by the way? - Honestly? - Honestly! I came to meet you. - But you didn't know about me at all. - I didn't. Now I know. Can I tell you something as a friend? - This Irakly won't do for you. - Maybe you do? Why not? Give me some time and you'll see. For now it's too fussy and nervous: "Tolik, hi, call me back. Valera, do me a favor and bla-bla-bla" It's impossible to hear each other. Commune with me in a normal way. You'll see. Well, I'm kind, not stupid, delicate young man with serious intentions.

It seems to me, we won't see him... probably. - Probably or not? - Say Happy New Year to your mom from me. I will, thank you. Honestly speaking, there's no full guarantee. You know, there's only one person who can clear it up. It's your father. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. And You know, when you tear yourself away from a very hard day... - What arrested for? - Honestly? I had a quarrel with my girlfriend and she called the police. With your girlfriend? Come out. Achtung! Kapitulieren. Now I'll carry out an interrogation. - I don't drink. - It happens. But today you'll have to do it within the bounds of the investigation. One litre of vodka and your subconsciousness uncovers itself. And in an hour we get a voluntary confession. - Is it right? - Good clock. Hey, there's no such hurry! - Here you are. - Thank you. - You see, I told you, it would be alright. You worried in vain. - Thank you. - We checked everything and it's ok. - We let you go. Thank you very much for your company. - Thank you. but in future, please, get a registration for the apartment you live in. - We'll take it into our consideration. - Good bye. Happy New Year. What do you mean? What are you getting at? You're not going to pay me? Ippolit Georgiyevich, no problem. - It's enough. - No, dad, don't come up. I'm going downstairs already. - Is it true? - Wait for me in the car. - What car? - It's not for you... - Wait, dad. Just in case, lock the door. I'm so sorry, Nadya. Did you fix the antenna? Oh, yes. But they broke our station and the network doesn't work. Your father is a great man! Ippolit Georgiyevich, I'm very glad you found the time and came. That's very important for me. - Where's he? - Who? - Well, this...? - What floor? - Fourth, please. I'll take the next one. Nadya, it's not a trolleybus. I haven't seen such messy children.

You're lying! -30 years have passed and you're still the same. - What are we doing? - We're arguing. - We're quarrelling. Is there any difference? Nadya, you promised to call me. There're so many drunks around here. Oh, you became so... So what? She loved you, she was waiting for you... - I didn't wait! - I know it better. She left her husband. That one... I always forget his name... Ippolit is my name. Nadya, why did you asked me to come? You wanted me to see what a nice communication you've got? What are you doing here? - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year to you, too. - Are you Nadya? - Yes. We have a wonderful daughter with Nadya and you are a loser. Nobody was waiting for you here. So, good bye. Need help with the elevator? - Thank you, - I can do it myself. You're welcome. Good bye, loser. You know, Ippolit Georgiyevich is right... but he's wrong, too. A loser? Why? I don't know about you Why? I don't know about you but I had happiness in my life. I mean I didn't... because happiness is not a rhinitis, it can'tjust pass away. If it's given to a man then it's forever And it always protected me in my life. This happiness is like an armor to me. You'll say it happened long ago, but no. It was just yesterday or even today in the morning. It doesn't leave. Someone said that love doesn't have past time. It's true. I know it for sure. o i'm a very happy man. I'm lucky in this life and I wish it to you, too. Nadezda Vasilievna, Ippolit Georgiyevich, The New Year has come already. Let's celebrate it. Come on, let's go to the table. Ippolit Georgiyevich, Nadya... Excuse me, are you with us? I'll come later, I feel too nervous now. Dear Nadezhda Vasilievna, Ippolit Georgiyevich, Nadya. It is a great day for us... Kostya? I'm taking a ticket for you and waiting for you on at the station. - You're not going anywhere. - Apartment 13.. I got one more apartment and one bottle. I combine these two things and make magic. - Oh, a man will come. - God forbid! You always said that I'm an interesting person, that we have a lot in common. I'm not boasting, it's just your words. I know I've got a lot of shortcomings. I'm too energetic and my name is Irakly, though I don't look like Iraklys at all. - My parents named me in honor of Irakly Andronnikov, remember him? - Of course, we do. I just don't get it. I just was there on the roof and he was here digging as a mole. Did you like him? Tell us Tell us honestly. Don't worry, I respect myself well enough to leave when I'm asked at first demand. Should I leave? Irakly, I don't think.. ...you should take this episode so seriously. It happens to women - they imagine something but it then passes away. Am I right? Nadya, should I leave? No. Ok, then Nadezhda Vasilievna, Ippolit Georgiyevich, Nadya... Oh... I hope it's not... - Did you ring the door? - Oh, Happy New Year! We didn't call for Santa Claus. Could you help me? - Do you have a girl in there? Oh, you do. I'm very sorry... Could you help me? My Snow Maiden had too much of champagne and got into a hospital. And I've got the last apartment to visit. - There are 5 children waiting for me. - Do you want me to become a Snow Maiden? - Yes. Nadya, it might be fun. - Nadya, it might be fun. - No fun at all. You must have a standby Maiden. We can't help you. Go out, please. - Ok, I'll go. - Nadya! Dear! What? Why do I always have to do what you want! When I was a child, you put me on a chair and I recited poetry When I was 10, I was playing the violin. At 16 I entered the faculty of law. It was always that someone decided everything for me. I don't want it anymore. Can I make what I really want at least once in my life? It's a New Year! - Make me a gift - Nadya! It won't be long. Thank you so much. What a good girl. Happy New Year! Lukashin, is it you again? Happy New Year! I wish you joy and happiness. Where's that one... that changed into his costume? Where's the false Santa? I asked a young man to help me and he agreed... but only with his own Snow Maiden. - What apartment number? - Number 13! Jingle bells, jingle bells, - Who are you? - I came for the Santa. Wait. You see, I've got a lot of children. - I've got children, too. - What children? - Future children. Listen, you've got future children and mine are present. They wait all night, can't sleep. Ok, ok. Come on, kids. Now you'll here a fairy tail. - Excuse me. - My dear, we haven't finished yet. 500 rubles for the fairy tail. Ok, sit down. A fairy tail. 500 rubles. - Whom would you like to hear about? - Could it be about a rabbit? - About whom? - A rabbit. - A rabbit. A rabbit. Once upon a time there lived a rabbit. A hare. Once he went for his usual walk nd wandered to somebody else's burrow. Is that from a fairy tail? It's just a very old russian fairy tail. So he wandered to this burrow... - and there is she. - A Snow Maiden. - A Sleeping Beauty! - Good boy! A Beauty, but sleeping one. No one could wake her up. - A prince. She had a prince on a silver horse. - Is he from that fairy tail? Of course. But even he couldn't wake the sleeping beauty. - Oh, come on. - Yes, yes. Once when the old tower clock struck midnight - boom-boom the hair kissed the sleeping beauty. Could you give more details here, please? And the hair realized that now he's head over heels in love with her. He asked the sleeping beauty to become his wife. Listen, hair, get the hell out of here and follow your father - an old shabby hair. - These were the words of the prince on a silver horse The hair answered him "Too rude, prince. My father is not old and not shabby. By the way, he was loved by the mother of the sleeping beauty, who was also a sleeping beauty, and they had their own fairy tail that hasn't come to an end yet. Marry me. Wait. How can a hair marry a beauty? He's an animal and she's a human. Don't be silent. - Answer the hair, come on. - Please, say something. It's time to make the choice. It's time to make the choice. Whom should she marry? The prince on a silver horse or the hair? - What kind of fairy tail is it? - It's a modern fairy tail. Let's vote. Who's for the prince, please, raise your hands. One. Who's for the hair? The hair wins with the majority of voices. So this is the happy end. Very good. Hush, hush. You're a good actor. Drink! - I can't. - Drink. - Drink, drink. - I can't. - Come on, come on. - I can't. - Take it. - Nadya, tell them I can't. - I don't care. - Drink. - Give it to me. You don't care. Nadya, I'll fall down right now, I'll almost die. And people don't lie before death. I want to say that everything I told you - from the name of the hair... - Yes... came from my heart and it's all true and it was also true there on the stairs because I realized it at once... Calm down, hair. - ... that he is not the real prince. - Of course. He... he is a fool. - And it's not good. - Too rude, little hair. - Wait, hair. - That's how the story ends. - Take him to the airport. - Ok, I'll get him there and be back soon. Don't come back. Are you sure? Yes. - Can you help me to load the body? - Where? - In a taxi. - How was the performance? - Good. It may be of use to me in future. Good bye, thank you. Nadya, did I get something wrong? Oh, you got it right. Why you always think... ...that nothing can be decided without you? Now you don't have your own happiness... ...and others missed it because of you. Call a taxi for me, please. Wait for me. I'll be back soon. Are you sure? Zhenya! Every New Year Eve I was waiting for to find you in my apartment again. - Drunk and after bath? - Drunk and after bath. What nonsense. What a foolish thing to think about it for 30 years and to make nothing! Probably, if you don't do something in time, you'll never do it at all. - What do we do now? - Come in to the train, it starts. Hey, chief, come on. - We'll be late for the plane. - We'll start when it's greenlight. Oh, are you a girl? - Yes, I am. - By the way, are you married? Me neither. Though I'd really like to. Explain me, please, as a woman, why she did chose this stupid Santa Claus instead of me a strong, reliable man who wants to have a family and children. What for? What for? Do people love for something? How do children love - just for nothing, not on purpose. I don't love on purpose, too. I'm alone in another city, I'm from Vladivostok I had to work so hard... Who's flying? I can't register him in this condition. My dear, he was bringing happines to people all night long. Ok, Sergey, take Santa to the plane. - God bless you. - Aaa... Doctor, say A. Kostya, well done! - Why are you so sad? - Santa cheated me. Oh, no. He was waiting for us at home and we weren't there. Santa promised me a cellphone. Was Santa waiting for you at home? He asked to give it to you. And this is from me. - Happy New Year! - Oh, it's so expensive. - No problem! - Thanks! I want this night to be gone as soon as possible, to see the sun. - Do you know where's the sun now? - Maybe in Vladivostok. Exactly. I'm flying home. Hi! Where's the coat? What coat? - The blue one. - With a white collar. - This coat went to the airport. - By itself? - With the hair. - You, too. - Where? - To the airport. Dear passengers, the flight is delayed due to weather conditions Moscow airports do not accept flights. Please, leave the plane and wait in the airport. We apologize for the inconvenience - Already landed? - Landed. Here it is! Impostor! Take the coat off! - Wake up - Take me home, please. -3d Builders street. - We know it. - Well, but where is mine? We know it. Are you real Santa? What? You don't believe it? Well, usually we had uncle Pasha as Santa. Can I make a wish? Well, go ahead. - Can I make two? - Don't get smart! - Only one then. - Yes. - Ok. I wish my father.. .. to be well ...and I was like my father. Is it possible? - Got it. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Also I want to be back in Saint Petersburg. - Do you have conscience?! - I do. - Sleep then. Oh, here is the coat. Listen, I can't imagine there're four more... - Yes. - Where're you? - Dad, I'm ok, I'm already home. Good! Don't be sad. It always seems to us that what we are ooking for is somewhere far away, but in fact it may be very close. - Wait, I wanted to ask - is it possible to cure burns with calendula? - Of course, not. - Did you burn yourself? - Well, in some way. I'm sorry, dad, I need to make a call. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you to wake up. Is it you at my place or I'm at yours? What's the difference.
