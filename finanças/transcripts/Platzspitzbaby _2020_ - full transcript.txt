- Daddy! - Mia! Mia! - Mummy! - Hey, baby. I told you I'd come home. - You should have stayed in the car! - You know what? - Don't touch me! - Leave us alone! Let's go to the car, baby. - What do you want from my daughter? - She's my daughter, too! You were gone for three days. Three days! Stop it! In the 1980s, one of the world's largest open drug scenes formed around the Platzspitz park in Zurich. The "needle park" existed for almost ten years. On 14 February, 1995, it was cleared. The drug addicts were evicted from Zurich and deported to their home towns across the country. The small communities struggled to cope with the newly arrived addicts... ...and their children. Needle Park Baby - Hi! - Hello! - Where are my meds? - In the green Tupperware. But where? I've found them. Good. Hello, sweetie. How do you like your new home? Great. All right then, put away your things. We moved today. Social services helped. The flat is fine, but at night, the town is stone dead, unbelievable. Really! What about Monica? That's just it. Since the eviction, everybody's all over the place. Yeah, I'm better. I'm out of it now, I swear. Thirty-two fucking days. What? That's what I say. It was a fucking nightmare. Four days. I almost went nuts, but I did it. I can call myself Ms Square now. The divorce actually helped. Andy and I should never have married. His nagging stressed me out. Over. Finito. Baby, are you hungry? I'm starving. Can I call Daddy? You see him once a month. Remember this? - My pirate girl! - Aye, captain. Yes, look at that. - Yes! - Pirates' dinner? Spinach, too? - No, yuck! - Nah, don't want that. - Coconut yoghurt? - Coconut yoghurt... We'll take these. Wow, look at this. Our Pirate Island. "Mal-dives..." - Where is that? - At the other end of the world. - Okay? - Yes. Sandrine?! No way! Damn, Serge! I don't believe it! It's so good to see you! - Yeah! - At last, a normal face in this square town! - What are you doing here? - I live here, behind the railway station. You're having me on. Me too! - No way! - I swear! Mum, can we go home? Mia, this is Serge, an old mate of mine. So you're Mia. She's your spitting image. - Yeah, right? Such a sweet girl! - Mum, I want to go home. What's your rush, lady? Slow down! I've split up with Andy. Finito. - Will you come round some time? - Sure. Mummyyyy! I'm sorry. You know how much that was? 45 francs! And that? Just because the social worker demanded it. Fuck! And this too! I'm doing everything. I'm a good girl. Can I at least have a few friends? Mummy. That's better. You're a good singer. But you're a bit late. Ladies and gents, this is Mia from Zurich. Look, Mia, you can sit next to Sophie. "The red-haired girl was standing next to Begovic, and her eyes flashed angrily as she stared at Karaman and Begovic. 'A dog was sniffing that.'" For Sophie. "She pointed at Branko, grinning at him, and picked him up. 'Well, well, ' said Begovic, looking back at Karaman to see whether the farmer would withdraw his complaint after this testimony. - But Karaman..." - Sophie! - Yes. - Thank you, Moritz. Will you read now? "But Karaman, his massive shape looming even larger, was simply staring at the girl. 'Haven't I seen you before?' he asked. 'Me?' She shook her head, sending her hair flying all over the place. 'Certainly not.' 'Of course!' His voice grew louder, booming..." - Yes, look, it's up there. - Don't drag me into the forest. Mia! Mia, what are you doing? I don't like nature, Serge! Come on, we're almost there. - Is this a secret path? - There'll be a reward. Hello everyone! I should go upstairs, shouldn't I? - Let's go inside. - Come, Serge. No, Mia, don't! Mummy? Sshh, they're sleeping. Come with me. I told you not to come up here! I'm sorry! Please, God, help me. Please! Help me, God. Please. Don't leave Mummy alone. Please. It'll cost you, you know. Miracles. They don't come cheap. Let's say, five francs. Because I like you. Darn it all, you've come back, you lot! Where are the others? - Get down from there, now! - You come up here, you old fart! - This is not a playground! - Fuck you, old man! Get lost! Hurry up! Bloody riff-raff! Wait till I catch you next time, you bloody brats! Excuse me. - Excuse me, but this won't do. - I'm sorry. This racket has been going on for close to an hour! I'll turn it off. I rang the doorbell, but nobody answered. Mummy? Mummy! Mummy! Sandrine! What? Baby, where were you? Oh my God! The walls are thin. Maybe you should use headphones. We just moved here and the girl's always out. You need to be strict with her. Look... Goodbye, Mrs Schuler. Shit. What did you do today? I saw you with Serge. What were you doing there? You can't just run wild here. And letting people in here is not on, get it? - Nobody comes in here! - I didn't let her in. Nobody! Do you hear me, Baby? Nobody! Mum, you're hurting me! Fuck, fuck! Fuck! Fuck... Mummy... I'm sorry. I just don't want them to take you away from me. Without you I'm nothing. But I'm here. I'm here. Serge gave him to us. Our own pirate dog. Who would come up with that? It's 1000 pieces, and it's mostly sky and sea. It's all blue. There. Look! Mia. Mia! Dative or genitive case? Thanks for your participation. Remember your copybooks. And don't forget: Register by Saturday if you're coming. Look, this might be something for you. GANG WARS -A MUSICAL JOIN IN! After all, you can sing. Hello, Mrs Schuler. Hi. Hi, Mum. - Look what we're doing at school! - Look here. That's what you get for letting people into our flat. We pirates have to stick together. Right, then. When we get there, they'll want to talk to you, too. You know, like last time, in Zurich. Fucking social workers, right? Drive us crazy with their stuffy questions. You can do this, right? There. Mina. Mia Mia. Of course. Well then, Mia, umm... It says here you wanted to live with your mum after the divorce. And your dad? What did he say? I see him once a month. Mia, you know that talking to me is like talking to a good friend. Whatever you tell me won't go any further. I think it's fine you want to live with your mum. You're our best means of helping her, which is why it's my job to help you. So... Is there anything I can help you with? I want to go to the Maldives with Mum. What? How does one get to the Maldives? Here you go. Clean as a whistle. - Right. We'll wait for the lab report... - No, no, no. I need the advance now. I can't wait. - This month's allowance is all gone? - Yes. The kid is growing. I keep buying new clothes. Well, umm... Is this about your vacations? What? Mia says you're going to the Maldives. Well, yes. We are allowed to dream a little, aren't we? Yes, but dreams for 10,000 francs...? So, we'll start saving. Right, Baby? What? - What's so funny? - Nothing. Look, people like you just don't go to the Maldives. Ah, yes? "People like us." Hear that, Baby? "People like us." - No... - Not good enough for Mrs Bucher, huh? My tests are fine, everything's right. - So I want my bloody advance, now! - Yes! - Please sit! - Or shall I tell her there's nothing to eat? - You're pigging out while she's starving! - Please, calm down! Sit down! Enjoy your meal. Another coke? Another coke, please. Can you pay for this? Thank you. Okay. Can you pay for this, Baby? I have to go to Zurich. Keep the change. Get yourself something nice. Okay? What are you doing in Zurich? Goodbye, everyone. Have a nice day. Look, here they are. Below India. No wonder it's 10,000 francs. Nice, though. Did the old man catch you? - What do you do in the church? - None of your business. Watch it! - Don't be so bitchy. - She almost got us caught. - Right. - Fuck... Sometimes you're real macho arseholes. We go to the church to smoke pot. - Really? - The old fool won't notice. Unless somebody says something. I'm sorry. Want one? Helps with the munchies. What's that? I fell. Twister? Twister? Twister, come here! Is that your dog? - Sorry, I... - I don't want this. Buy me a new one. - Sophie, I'm sorry. - You know her? We're in the same class at school. - This little rich girl can buy her own stuff. - Stay out of it, you cow. "Ten ways to pick up boys". Soph, nobody wants you. You're flat as a pancake. - Are you with the losers now? - She's with the tough guys. Is that so? So show me. We have a jumper! Be careful! Go! You can do it! Don't be afraid! Go on! You can do it! Go on! - You can do this! - Don't be afraid! Please, Mr Störchli. Come on, please! Mr Störchli. It's only a small bottle. It would be really sweet of you. I got the mixtape from my cousin. Like it? I'm Lola, by the way. Those two retards are Kieran and Yannick. You're the retard, you stupid bird. Cheers! Cheers! P-27, top tune! I'm Mia. Join us! Are you coming? Turn it up. I rap like a shotgun and graffiti is my art. - What is this? - Rap music. Do you know it? - Is it good? - It's super cool. Know what else is super cool? Are we still doing this? We need 10,000. No, only... ...nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-two francs and seventy cents. - You went into the river, not me. - Yeah, but the cops came for you. Yes, but that wanker was screwing with us, so I told him. "Told him"? You went ballistic! - I didn't tell you to go into the river. - You owe me new shoes. - Or I'll keep the dope. - I paid for my share. Of the dope, yeah, but not my shoes. - They're wet, that's all, you wimp. - You know what? I'm keeping the dope. Okay, fine! Baby, do you have the 100 francs I gave you? - I had to pay for the meal. - What about the rest? Let's have it. - That's not enough. - Okay, give me your necklace. - Daddy gave it to me. - I'll buy you a new one. I'll do it. There. You know what? Next time, go to Zurich without me. With pleasure, you pussy. With pleasure. - How's it going with Sandrine? - Everything's fine. She spends less time in bed now. She goes out. OK, and what does she do outside? - She goes for walks. - Walks? Really? Who with? I have to do my homework now. I'll see you soon. But once a month really isn't enough. Time flies. Okay. So go do your homework. - Bye, - Bye, sweetie, take care. Sorry. Will you do my make-up? You're much too young! You need more practice with that, right? Yeah, I don't wanna work As you know well enough Wanna chill every day Just hang out and puff Every weekend's there for me to get wasted And the only way is up You know I can taste it The four of us here Having fun, lots of beer And weed, that's clear The Vodka's cheap but still pretty neat... Will you cut it out?! - Chill out, girl. - Got your period? Epic. Epic scratch. - Grown-ups suck. - Except for Störchli at the shop. He only sells me the booze because he wants to fuck me. - Really? - Yeah, you retard! I'll run away from here as soon as I can. - Where do you want to go? - No idea. Warsaw? Why not? I've put money aside. What a load of bollocks. You'll blow it on booze and fags. You've got a blow coming! My brother did it. When our old man was completely plastered and hit him again, he left. The cops say he was hitch-hiking. One day he must have met the wrong guy. They found him in Italy. In a canal next to the motorway. Anyway, I don't want to go anywhere without my homies. Come here. Want a toke? Next stop, Zurich Airport. Are you trying to impress the boys? Have you smoked a joint yet? That's good. If you want to, come to me first. The first time can knock you off your feet. I don't want any desperate lads to take advantage of you. - Did you get that? - Mummy, seriously? Hey, lady, I worry. I'm your mother after all. Hurry up! Hey, look, Baby, here. Come on, go! Have you ever thought about what we could do with all this money? Going on about the Maldives again? It's not just mine. It's from Serge and the others, too. Go! - And if it were mine? - We're not discussing this now! If I had enough money, would you come with me? Why, do you have that much? Right, go on! Go on! The usual. How's your mother? Okay.

Here, with us, forever. I can't feel my face. I think I wish my father would die. Pop and he's gone. You mean, seriously? I guess so. That's heavy. Yannick? That was my wish. Okay, okay. I guess I'm next. I wish I had a car. - Man, you're so unromantic. - No. It's for visiting you. I'm moving to my uncle's house in Bern. - They authorised that? - The notice came this morning. It's better this way. My mum will stay in hospital for some time. Wow, Bern, huh? Shit, Yannick! Hey, are you okay? Oh, man! Better out than in. No, not again! Hey, man, Yannick! - What about my moped? - The others will bring it round tomorrow. Whoo, you stink! Fuck! Bern! I'll never see him again. I'll be stuck in this fucking town. - When did you do your first jump? - What? Off the bridge. How old were you? - I never jumped. - Really? Far too high for me. That's for loonies only. Girl, really? Watch it, here it comes. Thanks. Easy. Shall we run away? What? If we both went it wouldn't be so risky. That would work, right? When? Today. Now. Go home and pack. Meet at the station in an hour. Mummy. Mummy, wake up! Mummy! Please, wake up! Don't leave me! Mia! Mia! Mia. What have you done? You let them in! You called the cops, huh? Ms Roth, calm down.

She'll stay with me forever! - Forever and ever! - Mummy! Mia? Come. Please. Look. As long as Mia says she wants to stay with her mother... our hands are tied. But she's a child. Who can't just be pushed back and forth. - There are procedures. - They take too long. I've called every week. We're a small community. I have other clients. "Clients"? Listen to yourself. The school holidays are over. Everyone's back. What more needs to happen! Sorry. My best to your mum. - Here you go. - Thanks. Why doesn't your doll have eyes? I don't want her to see everything. Did you do your make-up yourself? No, some girl did. She comes here now. What girl? - What're you doing here? - None of your business! - You know each other? - No. Mia, get lost. You're out of your mind. Don't fuck with me. You need to come with me. Don't fuck with me! Don't fuck with me!! Enough! Get lost! Yeah. What's wrong? Can I watch TV with you? Not now. Mummy? You said you'd show me how to smoke a joint. Okay. Put the filter up there, so it sticks out a bit. Then, you fill it with weed, evenly. Sort of like this. Not bad. Then, you roll it. You keep rolling until it feels compact. Now for the tricky part. Look. You go like this, then you slowly roll it over. There. And then you get it nice... Nice and wet, so it sticks all the way. Okay. And you're done. There. Ummm... You. Me? Nice and slow. Pull it right down. That's enough. Hey, slow down! And now... Let go. Feel that tingling? - Not yet. - Not yet? Well then, want another go? - Okay. - One more. - And now? Gradually? - Gradually. Baby? You're the most wonderful thing in this world. I'm going to stop. I swear, Baby. I promise. - Mummy! - Come in! Swim with me. I'm coming! Dive in! Don't splash! Mummy? Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! - What did you do? - What's up? - I almost burned! - Don't yell. I almost burned because of you! Calm down. What's wrong, Baby? What's this? - Give it to me. - You promised. Give me that fucking dope! Give me the dope, dammit! - You promised! - Give me the dope! No way. Right. Give me the dope. You hear me? Give me the dope! - Give me the fucking... - No! Mia! Give me the fucking dope! Don't you dare. I'll kill you. Are you crazy? Shit! Go ahead, leave. You think you're something better? Well, you're not. Go! Piss off! Go! Push off! Piss off! Okay. Just a minute. Now, you're the fairest. - And me? - You're the fairest, too. Throw it in. Baby, go like this. There. - How long will it take? - No idea. Do you know what would be best? Us two in here for ever and ever. What do you think? I love you so so so much. You're my girl, okay? Hello? - Daddy? - Hey! - Is everything okay? - Yes, everything's okay. - Can you come pick me up? - Of course. I'll be there in a minute. Where are you?
