Momma! Dad! Momma! Dad! Momma! No one imagined that one day the plants around us would suddenly come to life, and propagated at high speeds. They began to attack animals, and swallowed up every city one by one. In one week ruins could be seen everywhere. The atmosphere was no longer stable. One year later, wild plants occupied more than 80% of the land area which posed huge threat to human civilization. This unprecedented disaster is known as the catastrophe. My daughter and I missed the last evacuation. What are you doing? You promised me before we came out. Dad, it's Duoduo. It's not Duoduo! Duoduo is dead! They're coming, they're coming! - Duoduo! - Yuan Yuan! Yuan Yuan! Yuan Yuan, the sun is going down! They're coming out! Yuan Yuan. Don't be afraid. Let's go. - Hold on! - Dad, hurry! They're coming out! Dad, hurry! Be quick. We'll be safe when we get home. Run quickly. Hurry up! Hurry up. Yuan Yuan, turn on the UV lamp. Dad, am I being troublemaker again? Would it have been better if you had been able to save Mom? Yuan Yuan. You've done a good job. I promise. It's my fault that I couldn't save your mother. Dad. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you, Yuan Yuan. Attention, the High Command of the joint forces is ready to begin the reclamation of Earth. 141 joint operation teams will begin to deploy globally. I believe that we will have better results in the near future. Our government will also fully support it. How long have we been waiting here? - Can we go now? - Military's been dispatched. Hey, Mrs. Scientist, can't you take a break on a Sunday? I have no choice. This is a very important project. I told you that. Desertification in the world is very serious now. If this project succeed, the situation will be improved a lot. Mommy is saving the world. Hmm. Ye Yan, bad news. The vitality index of plants has increased significantly. They're out of control. Where is Chris? I can't reach him. We have to withdraw. Wait. Wait. I'll go out and check. You stay here. Dad! Dad! Yuan Yuan. - Dad! - Yuan Yuan! - Dad! - Hold on! - Dad, help! - Hold on! Dad, help! Dad! - Yuan Yuan! - Dad! Yuan Yuan, Yuan Yuan! Dad! Yuan Yuan! Calm down. I can find Yuan Yuan. Yuan Yuan! Yuan Yuan! Yuan Yuan. Yuan Yuan! Dad! Dad! Yuan Yuan. - Dad! - Yuan Yuan! Dad! - Dad! - Yuan Yuan! - Where are you? - I'm here, Dad! - Yuan Yuan! - Dad, my UV flashlight is almost dead. Yuan Yuan, be careful! - Catch it! - Dad! Dad. Dad. Dad! Dad. Dad. Watch out, they're above you! Dad. Dad! Dad, break the window! Dad, hurry up! Dad. Dad, behind you! Dad! Dad. Dad. Dad. - Yang Hao. - Dad. Yang Hao. Yang Hao. Why are you in a daze? Help me pack everything immediately. Daddy, Duoduo is missing. Later, later. What's going on? Plants will evolve in order to cope with complex environments, just like Venus flytraps, which have evolved to feed on insects in order to get enough nutrients. Excessive super auxin not only enhances the cell activity of plants, but also evolves a unique-Dear. - Nervous system. - I don't get any of that. Simply put, the plants develop consciousness. Don't talk nonsense. The mutated flora converges into a root network consume the animals and humans for nourishment, because the environment cannot meet their needs. It's too late. What does it matter to you? The situation is urgent. Listen to me, we need to leave right now. Finish these samples. There may be a solution. Didn't Chris bring this thing from abroad? Shouldn't he be responsible for it? Chris is too irresponsible. If I leave it alone, no one else will take care of it. - Stay away from it. - Yuan Yuan. The Super Auxin will be much less effective once it is exposed to the ultraviolet rays. Sunlight and ultraviolet rays can restrain them. Don't ever. - Ye Yan! - Mommy! - Mommy! - Ye Yan, hold on tight. - Mommy. - Yuan Yuan. - Dad. - Yuan Yuan. - Daddy! - Save Yuan Yuan now! - Daddy! - Save Yuan Yuan. Mommy! Ye Yan! Dad! Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad. UV grenade has taken effect. Request going in with force. Dad. Obstacles ahead have been cleared. Request going in with force. All members engage. Bio signal increasing. Yuan Yuan. - The right side. - The left side. - It's everywhere! - Stone, behind you! Thank you. - Best wife ever. - Don't like you. Come on! Lei, activate the UVA radiator. Got it. Lei, hurry up. - Shifu. - Cover him! - He's injured. - 21, you go and activate. - I don't know how to. - Hurry up! Watch out, mister! - Be careful. - Let's go. - 21 is it ready? - Oh, my god, I have no idea what I'm doing. Yuan Yuan, follow me. UVA, an improved version. Core 715, the fifth-generation capacitance. Whoa, how'd you do that? It's done. What a dangerous situation. We were almost died here. Shifu. This is why I hate field work. - Everyone take five. - Yes, sir. Li Mo, secure the perimeter. Yes, sir. Thank you. Who are you? An operation team of the Joint Force. - 21. - Huh? Keep an eye on the signal. Yes, sir. You two, find the stabilizer. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Shifu, how is it? - Damn it. - It's okay. Got any booze? Cheers. C8683. Do you copy? C8683, this is the Third Command of the Joint Command Center. Do you copy? This is operation team C8683 of the Joint Force. Captain Fang Yong speaking, over. You have already deviated from the original path. The reagent in the transport case was leaked. We have already arrived at the nearest P4 lab and are working on Plan B. GPS shows that you are far away from the carrier. What's the problem? Plant activity was heavier than expected. The carrier couldn't approach us. We only carry basic equipment. In addition, we find two survivors. Well, evacuate them. Carry out the D16 subtask of the Big Launch. Yes, sir. Captain. We found something. We really lucked out. Everything's still intact more or less. It's stocked up on industrial chemicals and medicines. Get to the point. We found a second-generation stabilizer L24. Lei, test it out. Everyone else stand by. Yes, sir. - Let's go. - Let me help you out. What's this? It's hope for the entire human race. This is my daughter. She kind of looks like you. If your dad were dead, you could be my daughter. Yuan Yuan. Hey, hey, hey. Buddy, buddy, hey. The captain likes joking. I'm 21. What's your name? 21? Is that a name? Sure, it is. It has a special meaning. I'm the youngest analyst in the First Research Department of the Central Academy of Sciences. I was 21 when I became a member. My name is Yang Hao. We've been looking for shelter sites. Are you here for that reason? - Shelter sites? - Mm. I don't think it is necessary to find a shelter site. Uh, it's normal that you have no idea about it. Follow me. I'm gonna show you something. Take a look. Catastrophe. Most scientists call it the global green tide swarm, after global predatory activity of the mutated flora. That was just three years ago. Recently, the Central Academy of Sciences has monitored that the plants have formed a huge root network at 10.3 kilometers underground. That suggests a second global green tide swarm is coming. And once it breaks out, 93% of the reaming human population will die. How much time left? Judging from recent biological activity it's probably less than 54 hours. A little more than two days. But you don't need to worry about it. We found a way to deal with it. Lieutenant, you're more familiar with the Joint Force, how about you explain. There are 47 launch stations set up around the world by High Command and the Central Academy of Sciences. As long as we finish the launch mission, all the plants will be back to normal. What are we launching? This. N-11 maleic hydrazide reagent, a kind of sedative for plants but permanent. Speaking of the reagent, I've contributed much - to the R&D stage. - So according to you, the reagent must be launched successfully from all 47 launch stations. What if a single one should fail? We set up these three alternate teams in every station - in order to ensure success. - Exactly. 47 times 3 is 141. 141 teams execute the mission at one time globally. I just don't know if we can arrive earlier than them. Hold on. Your predictions are based on biological signals, that's what you mean? Yeah. Any problems? Done. Stabilizer has taken effect. I read my wife's research report. Biological signals are unstable elements and cannot be regarded as predictors. Oh, sounds interesting. Your wife is better than the Central Academy of Sciences, huh? Are you kidding me? Hey, something's approaching. Get ready. 200 meters away. 150. 100. 80 meters. - 21, which direction? - I don't know. Only 60 meters away now. - 40 meters. - Under the ground. 20 meters. - Watch out for the reagent. - The case. Shifu. They're coming again! Open fire. The left side is breached! UVA damaged. Repeat, UVA damaged. - On the right side. - The formation, pay attention to the right side. Dad, I'm fine. Lei. Lei. This is the captain. What's the situation? Is anyone injured? Do you copy? I'll survive. Lei is seriously injured, and needs treatment right away. The survivors and I are all right. We'll get down right away. - Hold on. - Captain, they're coming! Pay attention to the formation. Commander, everything's under control. Meet you at the B-2 site. Lieutenant. The reagent. It seems like he can't see us. Shh. Don't. Keep close. Run. No, don't. Leave now. Go. Yuan Yuan! - Dad. - Yuan Yuan! Dad! Yuan Yuan! Lei! Don't come over. Protect the reagent. I'll leave it to you. Leave, right now. - Go! - Lei. Yuan Yuan. Yuan Yuan. Dad, I'm fine. The Lieutenant's over there. Lieutenant, are you okay? Lieutenant, are you all right? Where is Shifu? He's gone. How does it feel? Does it hurt? The UV device was Lei's job. You clearly understand the technology. We don't have an engineer now. We need your help. I can't. I have to take care of my daughter. Dad. What do you mean? Our men died saving you two. Huh? Gui. Dad! We'll send her to a shelter site. I told you, I have to take care of my daughter. Then the mission will fail and we'll all die. Have you ever had a child? Piss off. Coward can't be a member of our team. Let them go. You heard her. Shut up all of you. Let them go. Li Mo. Follow the navigation, you'll find the shelter site. As a lieutenant you should know better to respect the chain of command. I still remember the way my younger brother died. Let's go. What's wrong? Yuan Yuan. Yuan Yuan, come back. Dad, I'm going to save the world. You'll fall behind if you don't keep up. What are you talking about? Dad doesn't need to save the world. Dad just wants to keep you safe, got it? If Mom were alive, she'd do the same thing, right? Mam. Hey. You're carrying that bag wrong. Hey, buddy! You wanna know another story about me? No, I don't. - Dad. - Hmm? What is "The Snow Monster"? An old movie. Your mother liked it very much. Yuan Yuan. This is the place where your mother and I had our first date. How didn't I know? You hadn't been born yet. I remember I was late that day. Your mother wanted me to ride the Ferris wheel with her, which was so scary. My legs were shaking when we got off it. You mother laughed at me. Dad, can we go to the amusement park again in the future? Of course. I'll take you to the amusement park on your next birthday. After saving the world, I'll go with you to the amusement park, okay? Okay. Hey. Listen, after we save the world, let's ride the Ferris wheel together? Uh, uh. Lady Xu Jing, C8683, please don't shoot. Hey. My mother gave it to me. It's a good luck charm. She said, "Give it to her future daughter-in-law." Wear it. You better keep it yourself. What? Captain, the weather changes again. Dad, there are so many birds. All alert. What's going on? That is definitely unusual. What is going on? Captain, we're receiving an emergency distress call from operation team C3969. Answer it. This is operation team C8683 of the Joint Force. 3969, what's going on? - Report. - Green tide. It's the green tide. - It's the green tide! - Do you copy? Do you copy? Captain, the situation's not good. Bio signals are becoming more active. - What's going on? - The green tide emerges. How can there be a green tide at this time? Be careful! - Where should we go? - We're surrounded. It's the green tide. - 21, find a way out. - I'm on it. The building is collapsing. Run. Hurry! Be quick! Dad, what's that? Green tide! - No! - No! - Go! - Fall back! Hurry! Watch out! Didn't you say there are more than 50 hours left? We have 56 hours until the full tide hits. This is just the beginning of the green tide. This is just the beginning? - 21, report. - The road ahead is clear. Did you look at it upside down? There's no way ahead. Dead end ahead. 21, screw you! Get on the bus. Come on, get in! Get in, hurry! Stone. Go on without me! Stone! Stone! Hurry, hurry! Stone, hurry! Hurry! Catch it! Stone! No! - Come on! - No! Come on! Li Mo, come on! - Dad. - Get in the bus! - Dad, hurry! - Hurry! Hurry, get in the bus! Everyone strap in! Hold on! Hold on tight! Dad! Dad! Dad! Protect the reagent. Catch it! Fasten your seatbelt! Prepare for impact! Xu Jing. Captain. Stone is dead. I know. He gave his life for the mission. The green tide has receded. 21, check the numbers. This is a sudden green tide at a small scale. According to the activity level of biological signals, the global green tide may be ahead of schedule. We need to report this at once. I'll try to connect to headquarters. Joint Command Center. This is operation team C8683. Do you copy? Captain. The green tide seriously interferes with our signal. We're cut off. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Doesn't your UVA come with an internal signal booster? I already thought about it. But we lost the UVA a while ago. If we don't report to headquarters in advance, I'm afraid the launch plan will fail completely. Hey, look here. What if we connect to the signal tower? Hey, that would do it. I can install a receiver on the signal tower, and then we can connect directly to the satellite. We can contact whoever we want then. But how do we get across? Isn't there a bridge? Uh, you call that a bridge? Let's go. High Command still doesn't know the current situation with the green tide. We need to notify them as soon as possible. Yuan Yuan, hold me tight. Oh, I'm afraid of heights. Keep a balance. - Don't look down. - God. - Careful. - Oh, my god, oh, my god. Oh my god. If I had know I'd be doing this, I would have lost a whole bunch of weight. Oh, my god, oh, my god. Gui, what is it? It's cut off. March on. Shake a leg! Whatever! 21! Coward. - It's okay. - Be careful. Slow down. Dad, I'm fine. Don't be afraid. I'm right behind you. Be careful. Watch out! Get down! Don't look down. Watch out for the air blast! Dad, Dad! Yuan Yuan! Dad! - Captain! - Captain! - Hold on! - Steel frame won't hold for long. Dad! - Captain! - Captain! Don't come over! Gui, calm down. Are we just watching them? If you went there, you would kill them. Pull, hurry! Are you afraid? No. The rope can't hold it anymore! What should we do? Hold on tight. Li Mo. You're in charge now. How about I show you a magic trick? Magic? Look after your daughter. Captain! Mister! - Captain! - Captain! Captain! Captain! - Captain. - Captain! That building is going to collapse. The entire block is coming down. We have to leave now! Come on! Now hurry! Go now! Be quick. Come on! Hurry! Come on! Be quick! - Hurry! - Come on! - Come on! - Quickly! Hurry! Dad. Dad. Dad. Captain! We continue with the mission. I just hope that everything's still intact. Oh, damn. That's a lot of damage. Huh, jeez. Hope it all still works. Oh, it's locked. I have tools. Dammit! No electricity! We're so screwed. I think we're in luck. The power system looks like it's still intact. It should just need an emergency reboot. That could work. I guess there's only one way to find out. Are you sure? Hey, it worked. The First Technical Department of the Central Academy of Sciences Analyst Wang Dan. - We're through. - Access level. - Four. - Don't talk nonsense kid. Access allowed. Connection established, Lieutenant. We're ready. Go ahead. This is operation team C8683 of the Joint Force. Do you copy, do you copy? Commander, C8683 is on the line. Okay. C8683. What is your status? The global green tide is ahead of schedule. Our technicians have uploaded the biological signals captured 48 minutes ago to the database. We request the Central Academy of Sciences evaluate it. One hour and forty minutes ago. The High Command of the Joint Command Center has successively received multiple reports on local green tides. Based on the biological signals provided by various regions, the global green tide swarm is early about 52 hours and 12 minutes. Estimated time is less than four hours before the outbreak. That soon? Is it too late to launch the reagent? What do we even do? Check the equipment right now. - Set off right away. - Yes, sir. - Yuan Yuan. - Hey, Lieutenant. The High Command is broadcasting globally. Initiate the global model. Command number three received. Command number two received. Command number five received. Simultaneous translation which is covered by satellite network is initiated. This is the High Command of the Joint Command Center. This is an emergency global broadcast. While local green tides were triggered in various places, the Central Academy of Sciences observed a symbiotic connection between the root network of underground plants and microorganisms, forming a protective barrier on the periphery. Even if a large-scale launch of the reagent is completed, it will likely not penetrate the barrier, On consideration we have decided to cancel the coordinated launch operation. - Why is it canceled? - What happened? - What? - Dammit! What does it mean? Cancel the coordinated launch. What? Cancel the mission? - What does that mean? - This is Joint Command Center number six headquarters. Our scientist has concluded that microorganic barrier is under the compressive stress of the Earth's crust equally across the surface. So we just need to punch through one point. - Yeah. - The barrier should then crack and implode. What does that all mean? Yeah, good plan, I agree with it. - Why don't we have a try? - High Command, we propose to implement this plan. - Take it. - We have no time to lose. - As calculated- - Let's get started right now. It doesn't seem that simple. This is earth. Our reagent has to be injected inside, but now there's a barrier outside. Just like this eggshell. If we try to inject the reagent now we'll be blocked. Hold it like this. This is kind of like the pressure of the Earth's crust against the barrier. So as long as the stress is evenly distributed then the shell won't crack. However, once you crack the shell no matter where, like this, the Earth's crust will then crush the barrier. And then we can inject the reagent. About an hour ago, the Central Academy of Sciences proposed six plans to break the surface. They've tried out several plans, including high-density firepower, underground blasting, and molecular mutagenesis. None have been successful. Why not use nuclear weapons? At present, the Earth's ecosystem can no longer withstand the effects of nuclear weapon strikes. High Command. Wait a sec. The data indicates that the floral barriers are weakest in the deep sea area. We can aim at a point and use a submarine torpedo to break through. That plan was proposed by The Central Academy of Sciences 51 minutes ago. As the deep sea area is blocked by a large quantity of flora, it is difficult for the submarine to break through. At present, the flora has not fully affected the ocean surface. The High Command reached an agreement to invest all remaining resources into the Noah's Ark Sea Migration Plan to ensure the continuation of human civilization. I'm sorry. Although we also want more people to survive, this is the only option. How can they do this? And sacrifice so many people! High Command, can you hear me? Identify yourself immediately. My name is Yang Hao, an ordinary Chinese citizen. My daughter Yuan Yuan has always been hoping that her father can save the world. I feel guilty 'cause I've been letting her down. Who is talking? Today is my daughter's birthday. I should have taken her to the amusement park. It should be her happiest day. We've lost so much in this disaster. Don't you want your relatives to be with you? They may be waiting for you to come back home wishing the best for you, and waiting for you, good news. We have sacrificed so much. We are afraid of losing everything. There is an old Chinese saying that man can conquer nature. Our fate is within our control. Never give up. Therefore, I sincerely beg you do not lose hope, and let us complete the mission. I sincerely beg you. The Central Academy of Sciences estimates that the success rate of continuing to implement large-scale launch tasks is only .3%, but you can make your own choice. Command number three is willing to have a last try. We vote for completing the mission. All members of command number two vote for completing the mission! All members of command number five vote for completing the mission. All right, let's go! Let's finish this shit. We can't give up now. Never give up. Why should we give up? - Never give up. - Operation team H8594 votes for completing the mission. U7636 action group votes - for completing the mission. - Operation team B8287 votes for completing the mission. Operation team Z1618 votes for completing the mission. Operation team A4438 votes for completing the mission. Operation team C8683 votes for completing the mission. We must arrive at the command center. We must get to the launch station. Let's go. Let's go! Let's move it! Can you see crater? This is where the launch station is located. Over there look. Jeez, it's huge. D16 launch station. We have arrived. Authorization approved. You may proceed. It's a gigantic drill basically. We'll use it to inject our reagent into the plant root network after it penetrates the underground rock layer. Once it's successful, the disaster will be averted. 21, get it started. Yes, sir. It's not working. There's a power failure. I can't connect to the control system. How about now? Power connected. Lieutenant, launch machine D16 can still be used, but its defense system is damaged. We don't have much time left. Once the green tide breaks out and the plants get inside, we all die. 21, you're such a doomsayer. - Talk of the devil. - They're coming. Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! Okay, control systems are back online. - Let's go. - Let's do it! Gui, put it in. Other launch stations have already finished. Now it's our turn. All launch stations stand by. Commence the count down. Five, four, three, two. Here we go. One. Yuan Yuan. What's going on? It's like what High Command predicted, our reagent is blocked by the eggshell. Global mode is initiated. Simultaneous translation which is covered by satellite network is initiated. Seventh Navy of the joint forces. Report situation. Alpha number one, number two, number six. They'll use nuclear submarines to penetrate the weakest - layer of the seabed. - Broken through to the deep sea area. We're reaching the targeted area. Request authorizing to designate a blasting point. They're ready to break the weakest layer of the seafloor to achieve the eggshell effect. - Target blasting points. - So that the reagent will make it through the plant barrier. - Standing by. - Fire when ready. Drive detection completed. Fire! It won't work. Not enough destructive power. The underground root system is impacted, but the barrier doesn't break. The plant barrier is too tough. The flora is fighting back. The flora is attacking us. Pull back, pull back! Pay attention to the right side. - Immediately. - It's useless. The plants are becoming more active. They're jamming our communications. We're gonna die. We're gonna die! What's that sound? It's from the volcano. The energy for this launch station is supplied by the geothermal energy of the volcano. The engineering team designed four sets of maintenance systems underground to stabilize the volcano. Now, geological activity triggered by local green tides is making underground magma very unstable. Show me the map of the maintenance system. What for? How does that help now? Didn't you say that as long as we break any point on the eggshell then we'll succeed, right? Oh, yeah, I said that the plant barrier is like an eggshell, so what? So we use the volcano to break it. Oh, that's it isn't it? There's at least 200,000 cubic meters of underground magma. So let's just use the magma right? Exactly. If we close the four systems in sequence the magma can converge to one point. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. The heat generated by the magma can reach up to 1300 degrees, so we can just melt right through the plant barrier. Goddammit, the lines are down. I can't communicate remotely with the maintenance systems now. There's another way. There's an access point here. We can go down and destroy the equipment. How can we destroy the maintenance equipment? I, check it out. How about this thing? Explosives. Are you crazy? Xu Jing, you guard this place and ensure their safety. Gui, get ready. - I'm ready. - Check the time. We'll go together. The center of the maintenance system has a complex structure. Only if we find the key nodes can we detonate it. If something goes wrong, we won't be able to gather the magma. You need me. He's right. Get ready. Dad. What are you doing? I'll go down for a while and be back soon. Okay? You promise? I promise. Keep your word. I'll keep my word. We're running out of time. I've opened up the oxygen supply system, but it won't last long. Walk to the end, and go straight forward for 900 meters. Turn left at the fourth intersection. After that, go straight forward for 800 meters. Turn right at the second intersection. You only have 12 minutes. You have to hurry. Damn, it's hot. The green tide is accelerating. You're getting deeper into the maintenance structure. It's gonna get hotter from here. Have you arrived yet? Be careful. The scans are picking up a lot of bio signals ahead of you. They're very active. Good lord. What a fierce opponent. Let's do this! I'll cover you. Be careful. Why is the detonating timer already started? We're running out of time. Get up quickly. Come on. We have to leave! You two go now! It's up to you now. Do you like fireworks? Gui, Gui! Gui. It seems the door is locked. Find something to pry it open. Yang Hao, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Now if you leave, it won't be too late. What do you mean? Now let me be the one to handle it. Please promise me one thing, my daughter Yuan Yuan may become an orphan in the future. Please take good care of her. This is my task! Open the door! Yang Hao! Yang Hao! - Dad! - Watch out! The reinforced glass won't stop these plants. Lieutenant, where is Yang Hao? I'm sorry. This is the High Command of the Joint Command Center. This is our final global broadcast. The last four hours of the global green tide swarm all the joint operation teams didn't give up their missions, and held on to the last moment. My fellow citizens, although we can't prevent the disaster from coming, you have all proved that human kind is courageous 'til the very end. 21. - 21. - I'm here. I'm here. Yuan Yuan. Dad! Dad. Dad. I don't want you to save the world. You always keeps your word. I want you back. Dad, I don't want you to save the world. I want you back. Dad. Dad. I'll never misbehave again. Promise. I want you back. Dad. Dad. I won't run around again. Yuan Yuan, I'm sorry. - Dad! - I left you alone. Dad! Dad! The reagent has been injected. We did it. Commander, we've detected that the plant barrier's breaking down. The plant root network has collapsed. We did it. I can't believe it. We succeeded. Yeah! We made it. We did it! We did it! Which group is in charge of D16 delivery station? China C8683 Operation team. It is said that human being are the masters of the earth. But this disaster gives us a warning. An ordinary person brings us an opportunity to reflect by sacrificing his own life. No one knows his name. He is my father.
