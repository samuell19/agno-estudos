("EXOTIC BATTLE" BY KEVIN MACLEOD) (ENGINE HUMMING) Come on, guys. Where the hell are you? Screw it. Time waits for no man. Neither do I. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (WATER LAPPING) Hello? Guys, is that you? Oh, my god! What the hell was that? Okay, that's it. (GASPS) What the hell? (CELLPHONE RINGING) Yeah, what? No, you... Sorry, you just scared me for a second. No, nothing. Don't worry about it. Look, where are you guys? I thought we were meeting all at the parking lot in the forest. You're headed there already? Fine. How do I get to there from the beach? On foot, okay. Follow the red arrows. Yeah, okay, I got it. All right, I'll meet you there, okay? All right, bye. (SIGHS) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Here we are. Leave it to Donna to get the directions backwards. It happens. WOMAN: Where's the pool? Out back. I have to find the key first. WOMAN: Where is it? Uh, I can't remember. It's doorframe or mat. I'll check the doorframe. Come on, guys. Whose house is this? A friend of mine's parents. They hired a caretaker to look after it while they're away in Aruba, but I guess they got held up at the airport or something and my parents told them I'd watch the place. I told them only if I could bring my friends. They just said no boys. WOMAN: Sorry, Donna. DONNA: Hey, more fun for us. Aha, bingo! (LAUGHS) Caretaker must've left already. So, no creepy old man to spoil our fun then. WOMAN: Nope. Awesome. To the pool. Patience is not her strong suit. WOMAN: Yeah, we're getting that. Hey! It's about time! Those were the worst directions ever. Oh, whatever. Guys, this is my friend Jill, my old roomie from college. JILL: Hi. I'm Jen. This is Donna and Tiffany. Hi. You can call me Tiff. JILL: Hey. Kim, thanks for inviting me. Oh, my pleasure. Let's go on in then, shall we? Okay, this is nice. JILL: You've never been here before? No, this is my first time. JILL: Nice. This is sweet. Oh, I see the pool. Let's go get the rest of the stuff from the car. Well, I mean, I've got all my stuff here already. If you guys wanna go get everything set up, I can make us some drinks. Yay! Uh, sure. There should be a bar around here somewhere. Oh no, I feel like something's got me! It's dragging me towards the pool! The horror, the horror! She said she wanted to get wet as soon as she got here. What? Go. We'll get the rest of the bags. You just make sure she doesn't drown. We will? KIM: Tiff. (UPTEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, do you need some help? Okay. (METAL CLANGS) Those two are crazy. Yeah, that's one word for it. Tell me about this Jill. Well, as I said, she's an old friend from school. Why'd you invite her along? Well, she went through some rough times. I thought this might cheer her up. What happened? Nothing happened. She's just an old friend. You know I can hear you guys, right? Sorry. I was just curious. It's all right. I wanted to know who Kim's other friends were for a while. I'm glad to finally meet you guys. Wine coolers? Uh, later, thanks. I'll have a wine cooler. Yeah. (LAUGHS) (UPTEMPO ROCK MUSIC) Yes! Woo! Wait, here. (LAUGHING) Don't even try. DONNA: Okay, I'm going. Okay, yeah. Yeah. It's a lot more difficult than it looks. There it is. Totally relaxing. I'm loving this. No, no! Don't get my hair wet, don't get my hair wet. Marco. Polo. Ah. Donna, get over here. (LAUGHING) Marco! Hey, where's Tiffany? Good grief. Let the kids be, Jen. You coming in? Maybe later. Water's nice. JILL: I'm sure. Come on. In a little bit. Does anybody want anything else to drink? I do. You've had enough. You're not my real mom. JEN: I will, if you're going. All right. Donna? No thanks, I'm good. Okay. What's up? Enough swimming for one day. Anyone hungry? Munchies again? Why, whatever do you mean? (LAUGHS) There's a barbecue over there. I'll get it lit. I'm sure you will. We've got the usual. Hamburgers, hot dogs. Sounds good, but if you guys don't mind, I think I'm gonna lay down for a little while. I'm a lot more tired than I thought I was. That's okay. Yeah, we'll let you know when the food's ready. Thanks. What was that? I don't know. I guess she's just tired from all the walking. I guess. Come on, help me get those burgers and hot dogs out of the freezer. Fine.

Cheers. Thank you. How are you feeling? A lot better now. I think I just needed to get some food in me. Well, that's good. So, what do we do for fun around here, Kim? Any cards or board games? There should be some. Well, what's on deck for this evening? That's what we're trying to decide. I have an idea. KIM: What's that? JILL: It's in my bag. I'll be right back. Very mysterious. TicTacToe. Barrel of Monkeys. Twister. Now we're talking. Is that a, a... A hohal board? (LAUGHING) It's pronounced Ouija. I know, I saw the movie. Um... Well, I wasn't expecting this. Yeah, that's different. KIM: Why? What? I found it on the beach. Cool. Come on. We have to sit in a circle for all of it to work. Come on, guys. We have to sit in a circle. DONNA: I don't know. You don't know what? DONNA: Isn't it to summon ghosts or something? Yeah, isn't that cool? Come on, it's just a game. It'll be fun. DONNA: I don't like being scared. Okay, what do we do, hold hands or something? KIM: Yeah, hold hands. Uh, that's not my hand. (LAUGHING) Come on, guys. We have to be serious for this to work. Okay. Seriously? Jen, please. Okay, what do we do? All right, this is the planchette. We place it on the board and we each touch it with our fingertips. Then, we ask a question. And if the spirits are in a generous mood, they'll spell out their answer on the board. At least according to the rule, anyway. That's it? That's it. Yeah, that's what I saw in the movie. Plus, bloody murder. What? All right, we'll keep it simple at first. Does anybody have a question they're dying to know the answer to? I might have one. Um... Okay, what do I need to do? Just ask. Okay. Oh, spirit of the Ouija board. Please, please, please tell me, who wrote the book of love? Jen. Okay, sorry. Ooh. It's moving. JILL: Keep your fingers on it. (TENSE MUSIC) KIM: No? I don't think it wants to answer your stupid question. Right, that was so cool. (LAUGHING) All right. All right, let's try another one. Okay. I have one. Are you a good spirit? Uhoh. That's a no. (CHUCKLES) DONNA: I don't like this. Come on, anyone else? JEN: Ooh, I have another one. Nothing stupid. Okay. Oh, spirit of the Ouija board, how did you die? HUNGRY. Hungry? Weird. I don't like this. It's just a game. Yeah, don't worry. One of the girls is spelling that stuff. If you say so. Yeah, uh... Where are you Do the thing. Oh, spirit of the Ouija board, whatever. Where are you from? HUNGRY. KIM: Hungry? Looks like this board has a onetrack mind. (LAUGHS) Whoa. DIE. Okay, I don't wanna do this anymore. Maybe we should stop. JILL: Keep your fingers on it. Okay. Wait, something's happening. JEN: Yeah. JILL: Okay, everybody keep your fingers on it. Everybody, close your eyes and concentrate. (GROWL ECHOES) That wasn't weird. Maybe we should stop. Come on, let's keep going. Keep your fingers on it. DONNA: I don't know, I don't like this. Who will be the first to die? Jill. DONNA: Stop it, Jill. Come on, we have to let it finish. DONNA: Okay, fuck this. Yeah. Nothing's happening anyway. The spirit must've left. I think so. Well then, what was that? I don't know. Maybe it was a ghost. No way. A nonbeliever, huh? Look, it's a stupid game, I'm bored. What do you guys wanna do next? I don't know, but I don't like this. DONNA: Yeah, I'm out of here. (SIGHS) (TENSE MUSIC) (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Hello? Daddy, it's me. Did I wake you? No, sweetheart. I'm working late tonight. Is something wrong? I don't know, maybe. I just had a terrible dream. Dreams can be a doorway to the unconscious mind. I've told you that before. Tell me about it. I guess I should back up a bit. I... I was at the beach and I found this Ouija board in the water. Haven't I told you not to fool around with those things? It's just a game, Dad. At least I thought it was. Go on. Well, we were playing for a bit and then the board started shaking like crazy. Really? I've never heard of such a thing. Dad, you have to believe me. Oh, I believe you. I'm just not familiar with that type of manifestation. I'll need to do some research. In my dream there was a shark. I don't know if it's connected or not. I'll look into it. If I come up with anything, I'll let you know. Okay. And no more fooling around with the occult. I know. Thanks, Dad. Bye. What about here? Sure, this seems as good a spot as any. Okay. I'll just get the stuff. (LAUGHS) Uh, are you sure you want to eat now? Wouldn't you rather eat after we swim? I skipped breakfast. It's no big deal. Besides, I'd like to catch some rays. Oh, yeah. Uh, you should totally do that. I mean, we can do whatever you like. What was that thing that parents said about swimming and eating? Something like you shouldn't swim right after you eat, or whatever. Something about getting cramps. Yeah, I think that was it. I think that's been debunked. But is it true? I think you should look up what debunked means. Crackers. What? Uh, do you want some crackers? Sure. Uh, you got some... Uh, it happened to me as well. Pardon? Uh, so, Cass, I wanted to ask you something. Normally, all of your friends are around and I never really get the chance to ask you anything alone. Uh, so I thought I'd ask you now. Ask me something? Like what? Well, you know, we went to prom together, right? I know, I was there. Well, I don't know how you felt about things, you know, since we've known each other for such a long time. What are you so nervous about? Well, you know how it is. Not at this particular moment. No, I have no idea. Well, I wanted to ask you... What the hell is that? You wanted to ask me what the hell is that? What the hell is what? (TENSE MUSIC) Oh, my god. Is that a shark? Or a ghost? (SHARK GROWLS) (SHARK GROWLING) Oh, thank God. It's going after him first. (SHARK GROWLING) (SHARK GROWLS) (BOOM ECHOES) Okay, sharkghost thingy. You already ate. Please, go away now. (SHARK GROWLS) (SHARK GROWLING) (SCREAMS) (EXCLAIMS) Woo. Hey. Hey, that's right, I'm alone. (LAUGHS) Well, there's something you don't see every day. (SHARK GROWLS) Maybe it wants a hit. Here, sharky, sharky, sharky! This is some good shit! (SHARK GROWLING) Whoa. Personal space, dude. Wanna hit? (SNIFFING) That is so cool. (LAUGHS) Are you like some sort of air balloon or something? I suspect you're a figment. Do you think you are a figment? (BOOM ECHOES) (TENSE MUSIC) Oh, my head. Donna still sleeping? She went out for a run. Really? A run. Oh, run. Please, tell me there's more coffee. The kitchen. Hey, have you guys seen my Ouija board? I don't know. It should be over there. Well, it's not there. Well, that's where we left it last night. Somebody move it? No. No. Well, I want it back. Well, maybe Donna moved it when she went for her run. Well, it's not there now. I don't know where it is. Did one of you guys take it? We didn't touch the stupid thing. It's not stupid. Okay, it's probably around here somewhere, okay? We'll ask Donna when she gets back. For now, we'll probably feel better once we have some breakfast. She's right. Sorry, Jill. It's fine. I didn't mean it. Uh, there's pancake mix in the pantry and there should be some bacon and sausages in the freezer. The freezer's empty. And that pancake mix is like a million years old. I already checked. So, no brekkie? Well, there's coffee, and milk, and what we ate last night. No brekkie. Well, that won't stand. There was a store some miles back. I'll go get some groceries and bring back some breakfast. Any food allergies I should be aware of? I'll go. It's my fault. I should've made sure we were wellstocked. I can go, it's fine. We'll make sure the table's at least clear when you get back. Damn right you will. I'll be back soon. Bye. (TENSE MUSIC) Here's something. As a spirit animal, a shark may take on many meanings, representing the most primal and ancient instincts. One choosing such an animal as their totem must also be prepared for the spirit's unpredictability and its desire to hunt. Why would anyone want to summon a shark? Sharks are masters of survival and their power is unmatched. Manifesting such a spirit is illadvised. Three card spread. Past, present, and future. Le Monde, the world. For me, that's Jill. Le Diable, the Devil. That must be the shark. La Mort, death. Oh, no. (TENSE MUSIC) (BIRD CAWING) What the hell is that doing here? Hell no. Excuse me, Officer. Yes, ma'am? How may I be of service? It's my daughter Cassie. She went out with a friend and we haven't heard from her all day. Oh, that's terrible. I'll make some notes. How old is your daughter, ma'am? She's 18. She went out with a boy. Supposedly, they went to Sarsaparilla Trail for a picnic or something. Well, you know how kids are. What's that supposed to mean? Well, if they got caught up in fun, they might've lost track of time. Have you tied phoning her? Yes, of course. She's always using her phone. It's unusual for her to not answer. But I haven't been able to reach her. Okay. I'll get you to go down to the station and fill out some paperwork. Um, how long has she been missing? A few hours. Oh. Well, technically, she's not a missing person until she's been gone for 24. So, you can't do anything? I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get you to do that paperwork and I'll give you my card. If you hear anything, you keep me informed and we'll do the same. Okay. Thanks, Officer. Hey, Jed. Where are you? I'm in the middle of a case. It had better be a police case and not a case of beer. I need you to get down to Sarsaparilla Trail. Aw, come on. I'm doing something. What's so important? Missing teens. You get your butt down there or I'll forget that my wife is your sister and fire your sorry ass. Fine. (PHONE SLAMS) God dang it. What's your problem now, Jed? It's my dumb brotherinlaw. Wants me to go down and check out Sarsaparilla Trail. BARTENDER: So what? I'm on my lunch hour. You've been here for an hour and a half already. That's not the point. I'm a law man. As far as I'm concerned, I deserve a little bit of leeway. Besides, I work hard for this city. Since when? (CHUCKLES) That'll be enough out of you. Another beer, if you please. I thought you were leaving. Soon enough. Sarsaparilla Trail's just right over there. Ain't nobody gonna get killed over one beer. Besides, why do I get stuck with all the crap jobs? Why can't my dumb brotherinlaw go and check out that stupid Sarsaparilla Trail? But you're practically already there. You know, I come here for a sympathetic ear and all I get is grief. I don't even know why I come here. I assume it's because you're always trying to look down my shirt. Oh, yeah. That's it. (CHUCKLES) Guess I'll see you at church on Sunday. See you then. I'm headed out the back door. (TENSE MUSIC) (SHARK GROWLS) What the hell? (SHARK GROWLING) No, no! No! (TENSE MUSIC) (SHARK GROWLING) (GASPS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (SHARK GROWLS) He wants the groceries. (GRUNTS) (SHARK GROWLING) (JEN GRUNTING) No! (SHARK GROWLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (JEN YELLS) (SUBDUED MUSIC) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hey, Daddy. What's up? You have to find out who that board originally belonged to. I believe they've used it to entrap an animal spirit. How am I supposed to do that? We didn't even find the board this morning. What? Find that board. I'm going to consult a medium. I'll let you know if I learn more. I still have no way to find out who the original owner is. Jill, you've denied it for years, but your family has a history with the occult. That's probably why the board was drawn to you in the first place. Okay, but, but. That same connection will help you find the owner. All right, if you say so. Bye, Daddy. (SCREAMS) Oh, my god, Donna. Kim, no! Oh, my god. Hey, what did I miss? (TENSE MUSIC) What the hell is that nogood hillbilly brotherinlaw of mine up to now? Voicemail? That man is chained to his desk next time I see him. What the hell's going on around here? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) JILL: This way, hurry. Is it behind us? I don't know. Well, is it still following us? I don't know, Tiffany. For God's sake, calm down. All right, I don't see it. TIFFANY: Good. Okay, if we're gonna get out of this thing, we have to stay quiet. What the hell is going on? It's a flying ghost shark for crying out loud. That kind of thing doesn't happen. JILL: I know, I know. Ghost sharks? Who even thought that was a thing? We gotta stay quiet, okay? We don't want that thing to hear us. Do you know where it came from? I think it came out of the Ouija board that we've been using. What? The Ouija board. I think we somehow summoned it out of the board. TIFFANY: I thought that was just some game. I know, me too. Who knew? What are we going to do? All right. First thing's first, we gotta get the hell out of here. Wait. Listen. Get down. That was close. Okay. If ugly's going that way, we're going that way. Got it. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Oh, God. Shit. (SHARK GROWLING) Run! (SHARK GROWLING) No, we have to stick together. (SHARK GROWLS) (TIFFANY YELLS) Tiffany! Keep running. I'll meet you at your car. Just... Just get up and run. Get up and run! (SHARK GROWLING) Oh, no. (TIFFANY YELLS) Damn it. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) What the hell? You can't sneak up on people like that. Where did you get that? MAN: It's controlled by the board. I mean, who the hell are you? MAN: I know of the board. It belongs to me. The spirit of the shark was placed within it by me. Well, that's the... That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. MAN: Crazier than what you've seen today? I guess not. My father says you're the only one who can stop it. MAN: Perhaps. I have dabbled with powers that I shouldn't have. I tapped into elemental forces to try to control it, but you cannot control the sheer brutality of the great white shark. Even one that has passed through the land of the living. Well, can we use the board to send it back where it came from? MAN: I don't know. I can't believe this is happening. MAN: It's all true. The shark has killed now and will keep killing unless I can return it to the board. Well, we have to do something. Oh, shit. Where'd you go? You've come to the right place, Anthony. I can feel the otherworldly forces all dancing around you. You can save the dramatics for the rubes. I just need to know if there's a way to help my daughter. The future is often difficult to see. Always changing. However, the present is less of a challenge. Your daughter is in danger. Right now. The beast is hunting her. What can we do to stop it? There must be something. I will try to distract it, but if it becomes aware of our interference, it may turn its attention towards us. We have to take that chance. We'll be safe as long as I break contact with the crystal ball before it moves our way. Okay. Do what you must. (TENSE MUSIC) (SHARK GROWLING) (GUN FIRING) (SHARK GROWLING) I didn't think that was gonna work. ANTHONY: What's happening? What do you see? Patience. I've never done anything like this before. The strain is incredible. Of course. I'm sorry. But a shark... The shark is watching. No, you have to distract it. Doing so would only put us in peril. Hey! Over here! Fresh meat! Come on, you son of a (SHARK GROWLING) (YELLING) Mama told me there'd be days like this. (SUBDUED MUSIC) It's unnaturally cold. (SHARK GROWLS) (SHARK GROWLING) What the hell's that noise? (SHARK GROWLING) (GUN FIRING) (SHARK GROWLING) Jeez. (GUN FIRES) (SHARK GROWLING) Jeez. (GRUNTS) Open up! Let me in, let me in! (SHARK GROWLING) Oh, jeez. Open up! JILL: Come on. (SHARK GROWLING) What the hell is that thing? I don't think you'd believe me if I told you. It looked like some sort of flying ghost shark. Okay, maybe you would believe me. Is it still out there? No, I think the board warded it off. The board? What the hell are you talking about? Listen, I can explain everything. Just follow me, okay? You got a permit for that gun? How is this possible? Magic. That makes me feel so much better. What are we gonna do? Look, we have the chance to end this now, okay? But you're gonna have to do what I say. This is crazy. Pull yourself together, all right? There's gotta be a way for the board to get us out of this. Where's the planchette? OFFICER: Use this. Come on. Is there anybody out there that can help us? The shark. (SHARK GROWLS) Is there anybody there? Dad? But that means... Oh, God. Not you, too. (TENSE MUSIC) I love you too, Daddy. Goodbye. (GRUNTING) (SHARK GROWLING) Oh, no. I'm dead. (SHARK GROWLING) You hear that? You can't hurt me anymore! (SHARK GROWLS) Hey. I've got to use my occult training. (SHARK GROWLS) Mystic shield. (GRUNTING) (YELLS) (SHARK GROWLS) (EXPLOSION BOOMS) What happened? Did he win? I can't tell. What's stronger than a shark? Love in the human spirit. (SHARK GROWLING) (BOTH GASP) Fuck you, bitchface! (GUN FIRING) It's not working. (SHARK GROWLING) Maybe this will. This is for my dad, you aquatic douchebag. (GUN FIRES) (GROUND RUMBLING) (BOOM ECHOES) (SHARK GROWLS) That takes care of that. Screwing with Ouija boards is a terrible idea. No duh. I could use a drink. You? I could use about six. And some sushi. Too soon. (TENSE MUSIC) (PRESIDENTIAL MUSIC PLAYING) (PHONE RINGING) What is it? It's me. Mission accomplished. Everything on the eastern coast has been completed. The project appears to have been a success. PRESIDENT: Right, right. Right, I got it. How did the experiment go? It's really, really, really important. The experiment went very well, sir. We can expect that very soon it can go worldwide.
