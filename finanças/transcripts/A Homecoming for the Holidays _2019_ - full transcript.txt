RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Here's to you. My baby brother. To Eric. My boy. You're toasting with hot chocolate? I'm toasting. Here's to the soldier who fights and loves. May he lack for one, but not the other. We're so proud of you. Do you have everything that you need? Come on, dad. Don't... There he goes. As you get older, you get more sentimental. It just happens. Here's to you. And thanks for this past week. It may be our best Christmas... On record. Mom, don't you start now, too. To all of you. The family that cries in the corner together... Is the family everyone stares at. Really, you guys. Thank you for seeing me off. Here's to the world's best people. Also my big sister. Who will probably be famous by the time I get back. Come on, they're producing one album. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. You'll be headlining tours before you know it. One day, maybe. If I'm lucky. Lucky? You've been working hard for this, sweetie. I know, but honestly, I just... I just want to make people feel what I feel when I play. The way it lifts me off the ground. That's what I want to put out in the world. Actually, would you excuse me? Where are you going? You'll find out soon enough. Hi. Sorry, I didn't... didn't mean to scare you, there. No, no. It's okay. You started playing and I didn't want to disturb you. It sounded really good. Thanks. I... I was just warming up. The organizers of the event asked if I would play something, so. That's really nice of you. It's the least I can do. Are you deploying as well? Yeah, third tour. I spent Christmas in fort Missoula and RSO asked me to drive the bus the airport, so. So, what do you think of Canyon Pass? Honestly, it's... one of the nicest towns I've been to in all of Montana. My, my little brother will be joining you on your bus soon. Figured I'd play a song for everyone shipping out, just working out a few nerves first. Stage fright? More like... Overly excited. I guess it's hard to describe, but you know, as the saying goes, you'll never do a whole lot unless you're brave... ...brave enough to try. You're a Dolly Parton fan. You kidding me? I... I love her music. You worried about him? Sorry. None of my business. No. I mean, yes. I am. But my dad served, so I always try to temper my worry with a little optimism. Makes sense. I'm Charlotte. I'm Matt. Is it time? Okay. Your guitar pick. It's okay. Keep it. For good luck. Nice to meet you, Charlotte. Same here. Hi everyone. Thank you to all of you for your service. Thank you, Nashville! I would love to stay and play encores all night, but it's one week till Christmas, and we're all going home to visit our families. So for this last song, I'd love it if you could put your hands together one more time for my dear friend, Taylor Robb! Thank you, thank you. Now how about a big hand for Charlotte Quinn. Ladies and gentlemen, isn't she amazing? Thank you. Merry Christmas, everyone. Hope you like this last one. Here we go. Two, three, four... Here you go. Merry Christmas. Great show, darling! Thanks! What a way to wrap a tour. Thanks, Gretchen. I have something for you too. Thanks. I love this. Well, you're always losing your pens, but you never seem to lose your jewellery, so I figured if I gave you a pen that looked like jewellery, all your problems would be over. You're amazing, thank you. Charlotte, that Christmas song tonight, it left me speechless. And the buzz about you and Taylor? I don't want to know. Like it or not sweetie, people are talking about whether you're back together. I mean, even the people at the label were asking. Wait, you... you talked to the label? Yeah. And they are pushing hard to get you back in the studio right after new year. That soon, huh? If you need me to push the time frame 'cause you need a... Not to worry. I have most of the songs together. The trusty notebook. Did you remember to... Already taken care of. I'm your manager, and I manage. Your mom and dad's Christmas gift. Thanks for handling this. Anytime. All right, come on. We've got the bus waiting. Okay. So, you're just going to leave without saying goodbye? I moved my flight up. My brother gets home tomorrow, so I'm taking the red eye home to Montana, surprise my parents. Lucky them. Lucky me. I'm excited to see him. Must be nice. You could see your parents too. Unfortunately that doesn't look too promising right now. I guess you're right. Hey, you really nailed that new song tonight. I think we nailed that new song tonight. It's been a great tour, huh? I don't know, Charlotte. I can't help thinking that if we... If we what? Taylor, there are a million reasons why you and I didn't work out. I was... I was just going to say that you should consider doing a song on my album. And I could do one on yours. That'll just make people think we're getting back together. So what? Let them think what they want. Well, I don't like lying. We shouldn't let people believe there's a chance. I know. I'm just saying, think about it. Okay? Okay. Okay. I'll think about it. But you have to at least consider calling your family. Fine. Highly doubtful, but I'll consider it. Okay. Merry Christmas, Taylor. You too. Thank you. Merry Christmas, house. Charlotte! I didn't know you were here. I told you a burglar doesn't make coffee when they break into your house. I couldn't wait to see you guys. The Big Sky Christmas down at the American Legion, the cookies for breakfast, all of it. Your mother and I were running out of ways to distract ourselves waiting for you and Eric. Well, you could've put up a tree. We were waiting for you kids. Ready to finally take some time off, dad? I guess a little. Soon as Eric is up to speed with running the business, I'll start driving your mother crazy while I figure out what retirement looks like. I can't wait for Eric to be home. What time does he get in? They land in an hour. Yeah, the rear detachment officer texted, said they were right on time. I should warn you. I might have to sneak away a few times to finish writing some songs while I'm here. Well, fill the house with music, Charlotte. We love it. So glad you're home. I love you. So happy to be here. Now, let's go get our Christmas tree. Do you know who delivers Christmas presents to baby sharks? Here we go. Santa jaws. Good one, dad. Tagged for you. You've obviously got the... The heavy one here. You can pick it up later. Hello. Matt, this is our daughter. Charlotte. Matt. Hi. You've met? Yeah, we were hanging around the stage a few years ago at Eric's send off. It's, it's good to see you again. Yeah. Glenn, thanks again for all your help on the house. Your crew did an awesome job. Your dad's been working on a project that Matt has been managing for Operation Homefront. Yeah, it's an organization that helps with housing needs for veterans and their families. What a great idea. Yeah, they needed someone to set up a temporary volunteer centre here, and then your dad here volunteered his entire construction company to help us remodel a house. Sounds like something dad would do. It's what anyone would do. Now, who would like some hot chocolate? Ooh, I will never say no to hot chocolate. One? I'm okay, thank you. Okay, bye. So, good to be home? Very much so. It's amazing how just a few hours back here can relax every muscle in my body. How about you? How's life as a civilian? It's not bad. Yeah, it's been... It's been a year now. So you just moved to Canyon Pass? Nah, I'm just here through the new year. We gotta hand off the keys just before Christmas, and then... Matt, do you have a minute? Yeah, absolutely. You okay? Yeah, sort of. I made a mistake on one of those... Charlotte, hi. Jesse. Jesse Wong. Look at you all grown up. I heard you were back in town. Yeah, I'm just volunteering at Operation Homefront. Have... have you seen my mom? Saw her yesterday, yeah. Jesse graduated with my brother in high school. And if I remember correctly, played a tuba twice his size in my mom's class. Matt, I made a mistake on that form. I could really use some help figuring it out. Sure. I'll see you around? Sure. - All right. - Bye. There you go again. Is your handkerchief ready? I don't want to get a reputation. Strong men aren't afraid to cry. Oh, honey. Welcome home! - You. - You. - You! - You! So, you went off and got famous after all. All right, all right. Take it easy. Take it easy? You have any idea what kind of abuse I took from the guys when they found out you were my sister? Why were you telling them I'm your sister, then? Because I'm so darn proud of you, that's why. Oh, come on. There's a welcome home Christmas party at the Legion. Let's go. All right. And to dad, finally retiring. Cheers. Dana. Charlotte, this is Dana Alvarez. - Hi. - Hi. We served together a few years back. She was with me on the mission when... When this guy gave us a good scare. Yeah, that was one crazy day. I'm just glad you were there to have my back. I just had a meeting with Matt. Operation Homefront is helping my family with the new house. Your wonderful dad has been giving me updates on its progress. This is my daughter, Hadley. One of my best students, in fact. Incredibly talented. Just got into Juilliard. That's really impressive. Thank you. Not as much as, I mean, I'm... I'm such a huge fan. Well, the good thing is, everything I learned, I owe to this woman. Well, it was so nice to see you all again. Merry Christmas. Juilliard. Good for her. Yeah. But getting one of those scholarships is going to be tough going. And Dana lost her husband last year. It's been tough for Hadley. If I can help... We'll talk. Shelly Santos. We should go say hi. Actually, mind if I pop outside and jot down a few lyrics? Not at all. Okay, see you later. Hey. You okay? I'm fine. Except I can always tell when you've got something on your mind. Go work on your song. Okay? I'll see you later. Okay. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. It's really something, isn't it? Yeah. Big Sky Christmas, huh? Happens every year. The town vets get together and build this little Christmas village. It started when I was a kid. They'd do photos with Santa, this hilarious event where they all play reindeer games. So, you just came out to watch em build, or? Actually, I thought it might inspire a few new lyrics. I see. You're working through the Christmas break, huh? Sounds like I'm not alone. Me? No, I don't consider Operation Homefront work, I like helping out. Just waiting to hear back on a couple jobs I'm up for, so the timing was good to help them out. There you are. Hey, how are you? Good. Hey and congratulations, man. Jesse told me you're at the final round of interviews for that job you applied for overseas. It's... no big deal. We can talk about it later. There's this region that absolutely needs someone who can speak Persian Farsi, which your brother here took it upon himself to learn. That's Eric, always the overachiever. Charlotte, I was going to talk to you before I did anything. You mean like re-enlisting? Hey, we should get back home. That tree is not going to decorate itself. You're not going to carry that home. Let the kids do it. Everyone okay? Mom's right. We can get the tree, you guys go ahead. All right. Matt? Want to help us decorate it? I couldn't impose. Impose? Matt, we have more baked goods in our house than the four of us can ever get through. Okay, I'll... I'll go tell 'em I'm leaving. Thank you. Great. I can't tell you how much it means to me that you're taking over the business, son. Your mother and I are just so happy you're both home. Us too, dad. I'm still waiting for them to schedule the interview. But it'd be soon, right? I'd be shipping back out right after the new year, yeah. And that's what you want? Well, if I'm needed there, then yes, it is what I want. What about dad? I know he wants me to take over for him after he retires. Mom and dad are going to understand, either way. Do you want me to talk to them? No. Mom's waited a long time for this Christmas. I'll handle it. You sure? Well, that took a minute, sorry. Eric, you're needed for a photo in there. I'm on it. Oh, the tree. Did you want me to? Oh, no. Go. Be with your friends. I'll get the tree home. And I can help? Of course you can. He's basically your number one fan, Charlotte. Is he now? Every time you sent me what you were working on, I let him listen to it. Over. And over. And over. Yeah, okay, will you just... Will you just get out of here? Over and over, huh? Well... It wasn't that much. I mean... Really, though, the song about the mountain is one of my very favourites. The size of kindness, it actually made me turn down a job. Wait, I'm sorry, what? Well, not directly, but before I enlisted, I had a business degree. I'm listening, go on. Okay. Well, I was in marketing for almost eight years. But I never really felt that challenged. Something was missing. And then one day, I was on a plane, and I sat beside a recruiter, and we started talking, and that was it. So you just up and joined the army. Yeah, yeah, basic training, then officer candidate school, and served for five years. And then when I came back, I applied for a bunch of corporate jobs. And that's when I started hearing your song everywhere. "Moving mountains is easy when... "When we choose to push together." Push together. Yeah. Anyway, I turned down a job. I just, it didn't really feel right anymore. Well, now you know how much your lyrics can inspire me. I mean, that's... That's very sweet of you to say. Do you mind if we stop by Operation Homefront before we go? Yeah, no problem. Yeah, okay. Let's go. Good. Stay. Right there, stay. Need any help, Jes? I think I got it. Trying your suggestion of uploading some photos on the website. Well hello there. His name is Koa. It means survivor. He was a hurricane rescue. You've had some adventures, pal. Right? Handsome boy. We partner with pets for vets. They help place shelter dogs with veterans. I found homes for all the dogs we agreed to take, but then this guy shows up and, well, he's with me until I can find him a forever home. Seems like he really likes you, Jesse. You sure you don't want to keep him? I don't have the... Well, I have the space, but I... I got a lot going on and... Good boy. Should we get your tree home? Good to see you, Jesse. See you buddy. - Bye. - Bye. All right, Koa. How about we get you something to eat. I brought some more lights. Yeah. Looks great. Here we go. That is a good tree. Thanks for the help, Matt. It's my pleasure. I'm so glad they waited. Growing up, we decorated the tree on Thanksgiving. We used to do that, too. Where do your folks live? They actually passed away when I was in college. I am so sorry. Thanks. So, do you miss decorating when you're on tour during the holidays? I actually got a small tree for the bus. I couldn't help it. We put on the Dolly Parton Kenny Rogers Christmas album and just danced around with the band while we decorated. Can't imagine tour bus living. Hey, it's fun. Exhausting. We laugh a lot. Sometimes lonely. Lonely? Even with a band and you know, Taylor Robb? Taylor Robb and I have the same manager. And the same job, that's it. Don't believe everything you read. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Hey. Did you save me the flamingo ornament? I actually haven't found it yet. Hey, listen. I know I caught you off guard earlier, and I still haven't made a final decision, but it got me thinking. If dad's business needs someone to run it, maybe I should stay. He's here. We can start. I'll hang these up. What's this? Actually... That's your Christmas present. We don't open presents until Christmas Eve. Maybe that's a tradition we should consider breaking just this once. Charlotte... Hon. This is... We can't let you do this, honey. It's already done. Someone want to... Charlotte just paid off our house. Oh, sweetheart. Thank you. You guys gave us everything. I found myself in a position to help you, so Merry Christmas. Charlotte, you're amazing. Maybe it'll help. All right, let's decorate a tree, shall we? Let's, let's do that! Nicely done, everyone. Mom, it's so pretty. It's beautiful. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Look. Look, look, look. Look what I found! There it is! I knew we'd find it. I found it. - You. - You. You. I want to thank you guys for having me. But I should probably take off now, so. You sure you won't stay for dinner? Well, Jesse could really use a hand, and I have a full day of collecting toys tomorrow for Operation Homefront. So, I'll leave you to some family time. Thanks for your help, Matt. Thanks, Matt. Goodnight. Hey. If you, if you need help collecting toys tomorrow, I'm around. Aren't you... supposed to be writing songs? Well, hanging out with you might give me something to write about. I mean, being home in the town. Writing about the... The town. Town. Yeah. Sure. Why not? I'll pick you up at 9:00 am? Sounds good. All right. See you then. Okay. Why don't we drop these off the American Legion? Sounds good. And you mind if we go check on the house we're working on for Dana and her daughter? Count me in. Looks great. Yeah, doesn't it? I'm going to go make sure they've got the upstairs rooms painted. I shouldn't be long. Okay? Hey fellas, how's it going? Hey guys. Just trying to keep dad here from putting his back out again. Like I told your mother, my back is fine. But for some reason, no one seems to believe me. I believe you, dad. Thank you, honey. But if we're going to get this house done by the 23rd, we're going to need all hands on deck. Yeah. Well, I'm going to go grab another set of clips. All right. Here. Can you sit down for a minute, please? Yeah. Take a load off. Yep. Oh, honey. I know I need to slow down, but I volunteered the company to work on this job because I know it's going to be the last one I do before I retire. I'm just so glad that your brother's finally home to take the reins. Tell me something. Would you still be retiring if Eric wasn't taking over, or would you have shut down the company? Well, to be honest, I never really thought about it. I just always expected he would. It's my manager... Take the call, it's more important. I'm proud of you, honey. Thanks, dad. Hello? Okay, so normally I would say no to something like this, give you a little more time to work on your album, but something sort of big is happening. Big? How big? The label thinks they can get you a spot on the Country Home Christmas special. Wait, what? Tapes live in Nashville December 23rd. Taxi! Two days before Christmas. And you would have to leave there in a few days for rehearsal. And one more thing. They want you to sing an original duet with Taylor Robb. Which means writing another song. I know, in addition to finishing the album I know, yes, it is a lot of work. I mean, it's a huge opportunity. I don't know how we can say no. Okay, I'll tell you what. They don't need a decision until tomorrow. Think about it. Okay, I will. Thanks, Gretchen. Okay. Bye. And we got a bunch of people coming over tomorrow to put the final touches on the decorations. Great, I'll be here to help. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. You want to head over to the high school with me and collect some more presents? Sure. Let's do it. Don't forget to stop in at your mother's class and say hello. We won't. Bye, dad. Thanks Glenn, take care. Bye, guys. All right. So, once you're done working for Operation Homefront, then what? Well actually, I've been hearing back from a couple of places I've applied for. One in Boston, one in Florida. Both starting in the new year. Any early contenders? Both seem great. One is working with vets, the other with seniors. Both are desk jobs. So that's what's holding you back. Well, my parents grew up in the peace corps, so I grew up always knowing I wanted to help people, and the army allowed me to do that. The same way Operation Homefront is doing that for me here at home. Well, shall we continue? Yeah. Who has another question? Hadley. So, when you have all these songs to compose, all these feelings to put into music, how do you get it all out fast enough? Ooh, another hard question. Well, deep breaths, first of all. And I always carry this notebook, everywhere I go. I've always written down things that mean something to me. Home, family, relationships, this town. How about you? What do you write about? Similar things. School, friendships, family. The good parts, and you know, the tough parts. That's actually what gives me the better lyrics. The tough parts. Whenever I can't think about what to do next, or the world seems scary, or too big, I take all that inspiration and I write it down, as much as I can. Thank you. You can always tell when Charlotte gets inspired. She can't help but show it. Let's give our guest, yes, a round of applause. Thanks, guys. And remember, tomorrow night's tree lighting. Your bandmate Hadley is playing some of her songs, so come and support. Good luck. - Thank you. - You bet. Well done. Thanks. That was really nice, what you said to Hadley. She's had a hard year. Yeah. She and her mom have been through a lot. It'll be nice to see them in the new house. She's so... driven. I just wish I could do more. Honey, the band room's free if you want to work a bit. And I can get the toys back on my own. Matt, don't be a stranger. Thank you, Mrs. Quinn. Patty. Thank you, Patty. Your mom has reindeer playing horns. Yeah. I'm guessing it's a little more festive than your typical army base. You'd be surprised. Some bases like to decorate, exchanging gifts, skyping with family, singing carols. And you? I don't like to celebrate that much when I'm deployed. I don't like to pretend that something is what I hope it is, when it isn't. Right. That makes sense. I'll see you later? Sure. Okay. Morning mom. Good morning sweetheart. What time is it? Almost 11:00. Coffee's in the kitchen. You worked really late. Well, the good thing is, I got most of my songs done. Good. I feel really good about getting back in the studio. I can finally take a breath... Ooh, hello. I just stopped by to drop off some tools your dad left at the house, and well, next thing I know, I'm wearing an apron. Well, I guess you're stuck with us. You ready to do some baking? I mix, Eric presses, Glenn bakes, and you join Charlotte on decoration duty. Let's get going. Okay, looks like my work here is done. Yes, indeed. And we are going to need more tins. I know. There is some in the closet. See ya. I hope there is enough this year. So, what's... what's the story? You still on the fence about going back? Yeah, and I'm trying to keep my family out of that discussion for a while. Plus, I'm still waiting for the final interview, so I'm not even sure if I'll get it. I mean, whatever decision you make, it's going to be the right one. Okay? And by the way, you probably noticed I've been spending some time with your sister, and you know... I... I just... Hey, hey. You're both adults, which means it's none of my business. I know, but you know how guys can get a little weird... Matt. You're one of my closest friends. I honestly don't care what happens between you and my sister if it makes you both happy. Hey, some heavy snow fell off the trees. I'm gonna go shovel the walk real quick. I got it, dad. Shovelling snow is actually one of the things I missed overseas. It... it's okay, I actually need the fresh air. You can supervise. I... fine. Help me pack up. I really should start getting ready. I need to be there pretty soon to make sure that Hadley is all set for playing tonight. Sure. Are you two okay with packing things up? Yeah. Yeah. - Perfect. - Great. Okay. That's a lot of reindeer cookies? Yeah. The reindeer are always my job. There's Dasher, Dancer, Comet, Cupid, Prancer, Vixen, Donner, Blitzen. I think you got the order wrong. Well, no. It's not Christmas yet, you see. So they're not, like, lined up to drive Santa's sleigh. They're just still roaming around in their little reindeer cookie corral. - Right. - Right. Right. Like there's, Snowflake and, Dave. - Dave. - Dave. We can't forget Dave. No. And, Jingle Bell, I mean, how could we forget. It's... - Candy Cane. - Can... Rudolph's mom. Candy Cane. Right. Right? That's good, Rudolph's mom. See? Never too many reindeer cookies. I'm just going to help mom get some things at the band room. I'll see you at the tree lighting? Yeah, looking forward to it. Hey. Hey. Why did dad just ask me if I was sure about taking over for him? Did you say something? No. Not really. Not really? He was talking about his retirement, and I asked about his future plans and... Charlotte, I asked you not to talk to them about it. Well, technically, I didn't say a word. Come on, we both know he's going to retire, and now with the house paid off he has more options. Right. But I don't. I can't just show up and pay off a house. That's not fair. I didn't mean it to sound that way. I'm sorry. No, I should've thought about how this was going to affect you. You did an amazing thing for them and I want to do the same. But also, I have to make this decision for me. I haven't even had the final interview yet, and well, please just let me handle this my way? I promise. Thank you. You bet. It sounds great. How do you feel? Ready. Excited. And nervous. Isn't that the best feeling though? No matter how long I've been doing this, I still get butterflies in my stomach before a show. But it's a good thing. Means you care about it. Just remember to keep your hands warm, remember to stay focused, and mostly... Remember to have fun. See you later. - Good luck. - Bye. She reminds me of you. Precocious and overly confident? Smart. Driven, knows who she is, and can't wait to get out of town. Well, that's not... Mom, I... I never wanted to get out of town. I meant eager to start doing what's important. I love that both you and your brother have left to pursue your dreams. I really do. It's just tough sometimes to have you both back only during Christmas. Which makes the holiday both special and a little bittersweet. It's my fault. I know I should try to come home more. No, no. Honey, that is not what I meant. I am so proud of both of you for what you are doing. I'm proud of you that you're doing what you love, and I'm proud of Eric for serving our country. And now taking over for your dad? Come on. Let's go light a tree. Yeah. Thanks, everyone. Before we light the tree, I just wanted to... Well, as many of you know, we lost my dad last year. When we moved here, and my mom decided to sign up to seek help from Operation Homefront, well, that was a hard decision, but I'm proud of her for it. This town seems to have all come together and helped make us a home. And on behalf of my mom and I, I just wanted to say thank you. It's been the best Christmas we could've ever imagined. And now, without further ado, I've been asked to lead the countdown. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Before you go, I also wanted to say, I am so grateful to have gotten to meet Charlotte Quinn. And maybe she'd want to come up here and sing a song for us? No, this is her concert, it's not about me. It's about the town and the pride they all feel for you. Come on. Okay. Yeah. Okay, first of all, how amazing is Hadley Alvarez? Let's give her one more round of applause. Okay, okay. I would be honoured to sing a song, but only if you'll play for me. Do you know "O Christmas tree?" Yeah? That's Taylor Robb! Hey! Taylor Robb, everyone. Can I, can I talk to you for a second? Okay, what was that? I'm sorry about the surprise. What... what are you doing here? What? You're not happy to see me? No, well, I mean, you just, you showed up out of the blue. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. It's just... Can we go talk somewhere? Yes, yes, come on. Okay. So first of all, wasn't that fun? We're just so good on stage together. You're stalling. What's going on? So here's the deal. I'm not as good without you. We both know that. Taylor, come on. That's not true. Every song I've written in the last few years, you've been right there to tell me how to make them better. You inspire me. Would you stop? You work great on your own, and if I'd been that helpful, I would've asked for songwriting credit. Strongest woman in country music. All women in music are strong. We have to be. Look, I know you want to stop doing appearances together because it drives speculation, but I also know the label wants you to do the Country Home Christmas special with me and... And you came all this way just to ask... Do the show with me, Charlotte. It'll be fun. I promise. Let them speculate. Who cares? It's not just the speculation. It means leaving town a... A few days before Christmas. I... I just finished so many songs and now we'd have to write another one, and then leaving my family? Now? I... Hey. Matt. Hi, I was just, just doing a coffee run. This is my friend Taylor. Nice to meet you. Hey, any friend of Charlotte's is a friend of mine. Taylor and I were on tour together. He just came to see about that gig I was telling you about. Right. Right. Looks like there's a bit of a line. I'm going to make sure we have all the supplies for the present wrapping event, so. Okay. Let me know if you need any help. I will, thank you. Nice to meet you, Taylor. Looks like I just met the reason you want to hang out a little longer. Would you stop? He's a... friend. Besides, we lead completely different lives. Can I get back to you on the show thing? I just, I need to think about it. Of course. I'm staying at the inn in town so you know where to find me. Ok. Thanks. Well, that was unexpected, huh? Taylor showing up out of nowhere? What's going on? Did something happen? My final interview was scheduled. I was telling mom and dad about it. Congratulations. I know you were waiting for that. You knew about this? Wait, is that why you talked to me about retirement? No, I'm sorry, dad. We didn't... I wanted to have all the information before we talked. We appreciate that. We just, well sweetheart, you often make these decisions rather quickly. We just want to make sure that you have considered all the... I know that this is all new information for you guys. Really. But I've thought a lot about it, and I think this is a decision I have to make for myself. We understand. It's just we're a little shocked, is all. You'll just have to trust me on this, okay? And until then, let's enjoy the Big Sky Christmas at the Legion, the neighbourhood lights, the cookies, all of it. - As a family, okay? - Yeah. All right. Goodnight. Goodnight, son. Morning. Hey. Place looks great, guys. Thanks. We're almost finished with everything. Well, I thought I would make my contribution. Thank you. So I didn't really get a chance to talk to you about Taylor yesterday. You don't have to explain anything. I feel like I do. Charlotte. We're just two people getting to know each other, and I say we should just trust one another and leave it at that. Okay, works for me. Good. Do you want to go to the American Legion hall and wrap some toys? Sure. Yeah, good. I forgot. Dad wanted to bring a tree here too. Oh, great. Alright, okay. Blue spruce. What do you think? We can get it. Yeah. Thanks. Here, I'll take that. Thank you. Okay. So, when's the interview? Tomorrow. In Missoula. I'm just wondering if I should blow it off, though. What? No, no, no. Go see what it's all about and then make your decision. You're still hanging with this goofball? He's not a goofball. I'm talking to the dog. I'm not gonna lie, I was skeptical that dogs would help do anything. I know treatment is important, but getting out of the house, the affection? I get it. Gretchen? You were right. Montana is gorgeous. I've been trying to call you about the concert. What... what are you doing here? Want to tell her? I knew you wanted to spend more time with your family, so I thought it made more sense to do the Country Home Christmas special here. Wait, you mean bring the whole show here? No, no, no, no, they'd send a satellite crew and when it's time for us to sing, they would cut to us live from Canyon Pass. The label loves the idea. You already told them. It's your call. What do you say? Well yes, it means you can spend more time with your family. But once it's announced, the news crews start showing up and you've got songs to finish. Actually, my writing has never been better. I guess I forgot that this is what I used to write about. When I'm here without the lights and sound, it's... It's pretty easy. Hey, are... are there any organizations we could partner with? For what? I was thinking a portion of my album could go towards a scholarship fund or something. Okay, I can't wait outside any longer. I gotta know. Are you in? Okay, fine. Call the label, say we'll do the show here. But being here is important to me. I actually want to enjoy my Christmas, and there's a toy wrapping event that I promised to help out at today, so... How about we join you? We can talk through the song, maybe get a little press. And don't forget, I am the present wrapping queen. I tell ya, you've never seen someone tear into a Christmas present so fast. She was like a tornado. And over in the corner, there's Eric. Slowly folding my wrapping paper. Should we go get more presents? Sounds good. Your family's really great. I can tell they all really love each other. Yeah. We had a pretty rough day yesterday though. Yeah, Eric told me. I think the hardest part is not knowing where he's deployed half the time. Yeah, it's one of the hardest parts for families. Last year around Christmas, he told my parents he'd be gone for 48 hours on a mission. Seven days went by without a word. It was the longest week of our lives. I'm sorry you guys had to go through that. We're lucky that he returned. A lot of families aren't. All right, let's wrap some presents. Yes, we should. So has Charlotte told you the news? What? We got the Christmas special. Taylor was just telling us about the special coming up. You have to write an original Christmas song together? Yeah, we do. But there's plenty to write about. Home for the holidays. Christmas with your folks. More the first one than the second one. Do you not spend Christmas with your parents? Not really. I come from a family of five boys. Doctor, doctor, dentist, doctor, and then me, a country singer. Not a lot of conversation left for the parents after that. But they can be tough, even on the phone. I mean, Matt, how often do you call your parents? I'd do anything to talk to them again. Sorry, I... No, it's okay, really. Sometimes the holidays is tough for that, but, I keep busy and, well this year the Quinns have invited me to just about anything, so. You're welcome anytime, Matt. Thanks, Eric. Channel 7? Perfect. Wait for me right over there and I will bring her right over. Hey, Channel 7 is here and they would love to do an interview. It's starting already, isn't it? You have to make a big deal, or nobody will watch. Actually, they just want Charlotte for this one. Hometown angle. You know? Okay. Right here. So... when was the last time you talked to your family? It's been a while. My family doesn't fully understand that entertaining people has value. I thought if I got more famous, this would help them see that it's a... it's a real job. Well, I've been a daughter and I've been a mom, and I can tell you that none of us stay the same. Parents have a hard time seeing that. So you're saying I should cut them some slack? I'm saying don't forget, they change and grow just as much as you. I'm sure they would love a phone call. I appreciate that. All right, I'll be back tomorrow in time for Big Sky Christmas. Okay. Well, remember to call us once the interview's over and let us know how it went. I will. And be sure to let us know when you're on your way home. I promise. All right. - Bye. - Bye. Good luck. Drive safe. Thanks for joining us, Matt. I told him he had no choice. I'm happy to be invited. Hey guys! Looks like we have company. You two go ahead and we'll catch up with you later. - All right. See ya. - See ya. Well, looks like it's just you and me. Feel like going for a stroll through the neighbourhood? Absolutely. Lead the way? Sure. You made any decisions about your job yet? Well, I applied for four. I've been offered two. Get a load of you! Well it's nice to have options. I'll make a decision sometime soon. - Hey. - Merry Christmas. Hi. So, do you think you'll settle back here in Canyon Pass? Maybe. Things are going so fast for me right now, I'm just kind of going along for the ride. Don't get me wrong, I'm... I'm really grateful, but yeah. It'd be nice to just sit by a fire and wear comfy socks and not have to worry about the photographers. I guess right now I'm just trying to keep it balanced. Never so busy making a living that you forget to live. Hey, there you go, quoting Dolly Parton again. Hey, I don't trust anybody who doesn't love Dolly. Merry Christmas, Charlotte! Hey. Does everyone here know everybody else? Just about. Charlotte, hi. I'm from Celebrity Today. Hi. Wondered if I could shoot a quick interview. I... I'm sorry, but... It'll only take a few minutes, I promise. Just want to get a comment on the upcoming Christmas special. Wait, you heard what she said, so why don't you just... You know it, it's fine. I'll... I'll answer a couple questions, just no photos or videos right now, okay? Works for me. Thanks. So, I just want to get your inspiration on the upcoming Christmas show. Sure. I'm super excited. We have 16 dates lined up across the country. And don't worry, I put the word out to the press to give you a little bit more space over the next couple of days. It's Christmas, for heaven's sake. Thanks, Gretchen. Okay. See you tomorrow. - Hey. - Hey. You really handle yourself well with reporters. I'm sorry I tried to pull a knight in shining armour on you. No, you were just trying to help. Thank you. I've just learned that the best thing to do is to set a boundary, give them a quote and move on. I- just, things are so different now. When we met, you were so nervous to play in front of the town. Seemed like a lifetime ago. I'm still kicking myself for not asking for your number. Don't feel too bad about it. I probably wouldn't have given it to you. Ouch. Matt, you were shipping out an hour later. I mean, who gives their number to that guy? Solid point. You can have my number now. Nah, nah that's okay. I mean, you're going to be off touring soon. It just doesn't make any sense. Kidding. Kidding. Okay. I would love to have your number. Should probably get some sleep. I have a big day tomorrow. Right. Writing with Taylor, and reindeer games. Thank you. Night, Charlotte. Goodnight. Don't... don't stop because of me. That was beautiful. The school lets me rehearse here on weekends and school breaks. I didn't know you'd be here. I was supposed to meet Taylor, but he sent a text that something came up. You are really dedicated. It's inspiring. It's hard to believe I'd be inspiring to you. Well, it's true. It's Christmas break, and you're finding time to write songs in, what was that g, g major? All the best Christmas songs are major keys. Do you know how to play every instrument in here? A lot of them, yeah. No wonder my mother loves you. Let's do this. I figured you weren't answering your texts because you were writing. Sorry. I was going to head down to Big Sky Christmas for the reindeer games. I should probably get going. Sure. Hey, that was fun. Hadley, you're really good. Thank you, that means a lot. See ya. Bye. Hey, look who it is. How'd the interview go? Great, actually. Yeah, I think I said all the right things. We'll see what happens. Great. Fingers crossed, buddy. Thanks. All right, gang. Last thing we need to do is clear a few tables and chairs from outside and we are all set. Great, let's do it. Hey Jesse, what's up? Hi. How's it going? Good. Are you all right? Me? Great. Sure. We'll see you outside. See ya, buddy. I went through the same thing, Jesse. Coming home can be rough. No matter how long you're back, it can still follow you. I appreciate that. I've been talking to a therapist. Good. Still, none of this is easy. Well, that's why you have us. We're here for each other. Always. That's the deal. You know, some days are going to be harder than others. Some days, you're not going to know what to do. Those are the days that you lean on the people you love. I know. It just, I... It's like he knows exactly when I need him. I don't know how they do it. Yeah, it's true. I've always felt they know what you're feeling before you even do. They're amazing animals. Think you'd be interested in adopting him? Well, I would. But I think everyone knows that it's you two who really belong together. Now, come on. Let's go start those reindeer games, huh? Hey guys. Hi, everyone. As most of you know, tomorrow night we will be having the key ceremony for the Alvarez family. And the good men and women from the American Legion hall decided this year's reindeer games will pass the hat to get them some more decorations. So, thank you. So they just called and offered me the job. What? Eric, that... That's great. Did you give them an answer? Not yet, but I think I'm going to take it. I want to talk to mom and dad again and consider it some more, but yeah. I'm gonna do it. All right, so the first race is a relay with teams of four. Two people on one side, two people on the other. One person puts on the reindeer costume over top of your clothes, please. I got Matt and Dana to do the relay with me. You want to be on my team? I'm always on your team. They'll run to the other side, touch the other teammate. They'll put their reindeer costume on, run to the other side. The first team to cross all four people on the finish line win. You got it? Got it. All right, let's do this! All right, Glenn. Okay. Let's count them down with a big "ho ho ho." Ho! Ho! Ho! So, wait, Eric. If you take the job, when do you leave? I need you to focus, Charlotte. Focus? Yeah, okay. Run, run, run! Okay. Hi! Hi. Great job at giving instructions, by the way. You are much better at speaking in front of people than you let on. Well. That's the easy part. It's a competition people, keep your head in the game! Sorry. I got it, I got it. All right, you got this Dana. Here it is! Ready? Go Dana, go! You are glowing. Well, look at this. I mean, everyone came out to help another family. Oh, this town. Come on, Eric, let's go. Okay. Bring it home, Matt! You run a good race. So do you. I know we're both going back to our different places, but couldn't we... I mean, what if we just tried. I've been thinking about this, too. Charlotte. There you are. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt you guys. No, that's okay. Mind if we meet up later to talk? Yeah. Sure. How about the... the Jack and fiddle around 7:00? All right. I'll see you then. Yeah. You do realize we're supposed to rehearse. Taylor, we're live tomorrow. I took your advice. I called my folks. I'm sorry I flaked. No, tha... That's okay. I... I'm proud of you. It couldn't have been easy. It wasn't at first, but the more we talked, the more we started to listen to each other, and I just, I kept thinking about your family and how much you all love each other, and I guess I forgot how important that is. Especially now, this time of year. I'm happy for you. I really am. And it looks like I'm going to be spending Christmas with them. And I'm leaving tonight. They're in France so I had to find a flight that would get me there. Wait, tonight? Taylor, the... the show is tomorrow. They really only want you, Charlotte. The producer told me that if I could get you to perform, then I could do a song with you. I'm sorry, I should've told you that part sooner. It's okay. I'm... I am proud of you. Hey, mom. You're up early. I heard you with your guitar last night. Sorry. Did I keep you up? No, I slept better. It was nice. Just like when you were in high school. Tried to write an original Christmas song in one night, if you can believe that. Did you pull it off? No. I'm too stressed. Taylor left town, I still don't know what I'm going to sing on live TV. The label is waiting for my songs. I just, I mean, I love what I do, mom. But sometimes I don't know how to keep doing it. Honey. When you were a little girl, do you remember singing your brother to sleep? You were three, or maybe four. And your brother would start crying, and you would wander in, look into his crib, and sing the only songs you knew. Christmas carols. Spring, summer, fall, it didn't matter. "Jingle bells", "silent night," all of your favourites. I've always loved a Christmas classic. I don't know. I guess I just thought that being back home would help inspire me. My advice? Use the feeling that's in your heart all year round. There it is. There's the look. I don't know what idea popped into that mind of yours, but I'll bet it's a big one. Thanks, mom. - Good morning. - Hi. I think I got all the... Thank you. You're a lifesaver. I think I got all the approval forms you asked me for. Thank you. And I spoke to Taylor. How'd it go? Well, I told him I thought this was a professional mistake to skip out on this opportunity. But also a mistake I was in favour of on a deeply personal level. You ready? Good morning. Who's excited to move into their new house tonight? So excited. Think you could make it to the party after the broadcast? Well, that's actually what I asked you all to meet me here about. See, I've been thinking about how great all this has been to watch, the house, the toys, the... Everyone coming together. And I thought what if, instead of doing the live feed from across the street, we performed at the key ceremony? You mean? When the Country Christmas special cuts to me, I sing the song live to millions of people in front of your new home. Can you do that? The special wants me to feature my family and people from my hometown. If we can do that and get to show off how this town comes together... Plus operation homefront should get as much press and eyeballs as it can, so... I'm in if Dana's in. Yeah. And one more thing. I want another guitarist to join me in my band onstage. So, Hadley? I wondered if you'd want to come up onstage and play the song we worked on together yesterday. Okay, this is news I did not know about. You can make it happen, right? Clear it with the people and... Is this something that you want to do? Yes! Yeah, I'd love to. As long as Dana agrees. Yes, absolutely. Yes. Looks like we have work to do. Hey. Thanks again for all the... Charlotte. I know... I know that neither of us are in a place where it's reasonable to get involved, but I... I wanted you to know where I stood. By kissing me in my office? Wait. What's happening? Are you packing? I am. I made a decision about the next job. Well that's, that's a good thing, right? And Charlotte. I'm going to... Sorry. I can come back. No, no, it's fine. Right. We'll talk later, tonight. Okay. I'm not quite sure what I just saw happen in there, but I really do like that guy. More importantly, I don't know how the show's going to respond to the changes, or the label for that matter. The label will be fine. I have all the songs I need to start after the new year, I just need one more Christmas song. And there's one more favour I'll ask of you for today. What favour is that? You remember how I said I wanted to find a way to give back? Yes. How's it feel to you? Honestly, it's kind of my favourite Christmas song now. Well, you play it beautifully. Yeah, but it's your voice. Yeah, and it's your music. You should be very proud. All right, should we go get ready? I'll see you there. Gretchen, hello. Any news from the label? Sorry, but we got bigger fish to fry right now. I just texted you an article. Gretchen, you've got to be kidding me. He... he was just saying goodbye. It doesn't matter. That photo is all over the internet. Okay. I gotta go. Well, what are you going to do? What else? Damage control. Matt, I... I need to talk to you. Hi, Charlotte. Let me go first. This past week with you has been amazing. Even though the excitement in your world is, well, a little more than I'm used to. Matt, I need you to know. There's a photo that a reporter took of Taylor and me last night. I know about it. And... you're not upset? Not at all. You told me the truth about you two, and I believe you. That being said, I'm not sure how we can make this work. I think before we get hurt, we just need to face reality. I'm going to be seeing more of you in the news than in person. Matt, we don't know yet what this would mean. Believe me, as much as I want to make this work, I don't think we should just jump into something we're not sure about just because of a feeling. This is what you really want? I think right now, we should just focus more on our careers. This life of yours, I'm not sure if I can handle it. Merry Christmas, Matt. Hey. So I thought I bring her by and introduce her. Her name's Cass. Look at that sweet face. Well, hello to you. But I still don't understand. Who does she belong to? Well, hopefully you and dad. Eric and I got to talking and... And for all the ways we're good at being a family, I figured we'd expand it some. But the final decision is up to you, hon. Welcome home, Cass. You brought home a dog. Someone has to live in our old rooms. Yeah, but now they have a dog they're going to love more than us. So, I'm going to take the job. I know you want to retire, and at some point we have to start giving back. Is that what you think? You guys both sacrificed so much for us. You think we minded? You listen to me, both of you. Your dad and I will always be fine. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to give back in some way. The only thing you need to do to give back to us is go out and live your lives. I just don't want you guys to have to worry. That's not up to you. And yes, it can be scary sending someone you love out into the world. Especially you, who sees danger and runs right at it. I learned that from you, dad. Yeah. The family that cries in the corner together... Is the family everyone stares at. All right, guys. Should we go? Yeah. Let's do it. Looks like Matt needs a pep talk. I don't think I'm the right person for the job. No? You two aren't gonna... No. That's a shame. You guys looked like you made each other happy. I think at the end of the day, we were both just realists. Okay. Producer's here, camera's here, we'll do an announcement for Operation Homefront, and then throw to you. Anything else? Hey. You got this. Thanks. Okay, I'm good. The other thing we talked about? Already set up. You can make the announcement whenever you're ready. Great. There you are. We thought you ditched town. I wish. So does Koa, apparently. You're keeping that dog, right? Looks that way. I guess I was the last one to know we belong together. I'm glad. You guys make a good team. I'd better take him for a walk before he cancels his adoption papers. How's the speech coming? You know, I speak in front of people all the time, but this is live TV. This is a lot different. Relax, you're going to be great. Thanks. Hey. They told me you took the job! Congrats, man. And what about you? I hear you may be running away. Wait, are we talking about Charlotte now? Like it or not, that's what the whole town is talking about. Yeah, you see? That's the problem. Charlotte is a country music star, and people are always going to talk about her. So what? She told you how she felt about you, she wanted to make it work, right? Okay, hold on. Hey, hey. If an opportunity presents itself, and it's the one you want, you go towards, not away. Didn't you once tell me that? Yeah, that was different. Fine, how about this? What does your gut tell you it wants? Hey, Matt? Five minute warning. So just lead in with some information about the key ceremony, and then you can introduce Charlotte. Got it. Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. Nervous? Yeah. But not about the show. I don't need this anymore. I have all the luck I need. I found you, didn't I? I should've taken the chance back then. I won't make that mistake the second time. Matt, are you sure you... Okay, we're ready for... Really, guys? And we're live in 3, 2... Hello, and welcome to Canyon Pass, Montana. To the men and women who serve in the United States Armed Forces, we at operation homefront thank you for your service. In particular, we'd like to show our gratitude by presenting the key to this home to Dana Alvarez and her daughter Hadley. Come on up. Merry Christmas, and welcome home. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now, ladies and gentlemen. It is my great privilege to introduce you to the talented Charlotte Quinn and Hadley Alvarez. Thank you. Merry Christmas, everyone. Before I get started, I wanted to dedicate this song to everyone who chooses to serve this country. No matter what you do, be it big or small. Thank you. Thank you guys so much. Merry Christmas! All right, that's a cut everyone. Yeah! Charlotte. That was so fun. We are not nearly done. What do you mean? Well, I'd love for our song to be featured on my next album. You just got your first writing credit. For real? For real. And congratulations, Hadley Alvarez. You are the first recipient of a new scholarship fund I'm launching as of today. That should help you out with Juilliard. Thank you. You're welcome. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. I can't believe this. That's incredible. You're good at this. Well, I have a good team. You changed that kid's life. I've always wanted to start a scholarship fund. It's a really good idea. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah. Now I just need someone to run it for me. You, you know anybody? I think I might know a guy. What are the job requirements? Well, he has to be kind and thoughtful. That he is. He has to care for others more than himself. He does. He has to be a very good listener. And that he is. And he's gotta be cute. Like, really, really cute. Really cute. Well, congratulations. I think your search is over. It's about time. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
