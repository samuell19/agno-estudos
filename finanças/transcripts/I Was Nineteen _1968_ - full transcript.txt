- Do what I say. - I am. Reverse the truck! - I can't! - What do you mean? We need some water. Put something under the wheels! Don't argue, just do it. - Come on! We have to go! - Okay! Attention, German soldiers! We are starting transmission. The war is lost and you are in a hopeless position. Do not wait - negotiate. DESERTER! I LICKED RUSSIAN BOOTS Attention! German soldiers! Before we report on the situation at the front we demand that you do not open fire. Listen to me. Trust me. I'm a German. I WAS NINETEEN Attention, Germans! The Red Army is advancing towards the Oder. It is only 150-200 km from Eisenhower and Montgomery. They are at the Elbe. Field Marshal Model is dead. We hold Vienna, Brünn's next. I see German road signs. They say this is my homeland. I was eight when my parents had to leave. Soldiers of the 9th Army. Seelow has fallen. Berlin is under artillery fire. I grew up in Moscow. My mother lives there. I fought like everyone. Soldiers of the 309th Infantry Division! Resistance means death. Surrender, and return safe to your families. I say this almost every day. I get gunfire in return. There are few deserters. Do not wait any later than 12:05! I'm 19. Come out! Nothing will happen. Surrender! Our Army broke through the front 3 days ago. We were moving north past Berlin. What's up? Where are we? Bernau. Lt. Hecker, to the General! Lt. Hecker, to the General! I've been here alone since the tanks left. - No soldiers here? - No Russians or Germans. You call this order? Damn it! We have to move on, but the rear guard can't keep up. The rear guard's a bunch of thugs! Comrade General! On your orders! Where are you from, Lieutenant? - Moscow. - Yes, but where were you born? Cologne. Well, I can't give you Cologne. The Americans are there. Bernau is yours. Remember your orders, Lieutenant. Come on. To your vehicles! Vadim! I'm the commandant! Awaiting your orders, Commandant. It's for real. You, girl! Come here! Quickly! Where are the authorities? Somebody committed suicide. Your mother? No. - You live here? - I was moved here two days ago. Why did she do it? We should all do it. Why? The war's over. Hitler's gone. - What about your family? - I lost them. The road from Pomerania to Schwerin is still blocked. It'll take two weeks. And then? Life in Germany will get back to normal. They'll clear the rubble. What will happen to me? Should I stay here? Or go back? Or farther west? Are you German? - How did you end up with them? - Lieutenant! There's one house that's flying a Red Flag. I'll go. The war has been hard on us all. We must forgive and forget. Let's help each other to heal our wounds. As mayor here, I offer you my full support. I heartily welcome you all. I'm the commandant. Your house is confiscated. You must leave now. Our first visitor. I bid you all good evening. I would like your permission to hold a service here. Print that by tomorrow. We only have a hand printing press. Were you in the Nazi Party? No. I can show you something. Our last issue. Then the printing press was closed. 28 February 1933. - Were you a Communist? - Not a member. An unaffiliated Bolshevik. Sorry? We need a mayor. - You will be mayor. - Me? I can't. You have to. I'm too old to be a mayor. You must! What are you changing? You spelled resistance "resistence". Too many E's. People would understand it anyway. - Need help, Lieutenant? - No. I can help you. I can manage. Clear out! - Take a walk! - Yes, sir! Not bad! Comrade Lieutenant! There's a girl here. You know her. Let her in. - Why is she in here? - You gave the order. - What do you want? - Can I sleep here? This is commandant HQ. - At least I know you. - This is commandant HQ. You can speak German? What does she want? She wants to sleep here. You speak German well! - She's scared. - But not of you? Of us Russians. Tell her, if you understand each other so well: I was scared too. Scared to death. She was scared too. Is she a real soldier? - Yes. - What? She asks if you're a real soldier. Tell her I'm not in the Army for fun. I have nothing left. No roof over my head. - She said... - The Germans invaded in winter. It was minus 30. People froze to death. I watched the old and the young just drop and die. Translate all that. Word for word. The Germans did terrible things in the USSR. - I don't believe you. - What did she say? She doesn't believe you. Because you didn't translate it right! No understand? Burnt earth. Understand? You stupid, dirty bitch. What do you know about it? What does she want? I didn't do anything. Why did you invade and torture a whole nation? It's not my fault. I wasn't there. And even if it is true, what can I do? I have no one to help me now. You see. Now they're scared. What's happening? Our tanks are back! - Should I throw her out? - It's up to you. Where do I sleep? There's a bedroom over there. Let her sleep there too then. Stop! Where are you going? Stop! - Where are you going? - Why? Why go back? Who knows which way's forward or back? Get lost! What are you doing here? - I've been made commandant. - Well! I'm the commandant! You're lucky, commandant! Let's go! Take care of yourself! Who goes there? Halt! 15-year-old Hitler Youth members have started the counteroffensive. They are led by wounded soldiers fresh from the hospital. Veteran 60-year-olds provide experience. Many have lost an arm. Chingis! Come for tea! Wake up, Gregor! Gregor, pistol on the table? Like Kutuzov after Napoleon's defeat! We're far from the front, buddy. - Where did you come from? - Time for breakfast. Get washed. Gregor? - Where are the records? - What records? The records I told you to get: Blondes Kätzchen, Rosamunde, Kornblumenblau... No records! Why the hell did they make him commandant? - God knows! - He's no commandant! We'll have a real commandant soon. - A true professional. - Why not? We had to set up new headquarters. We scouted the suburbs. Boot wax account. How did you get here? Why are you still here? This is a supply unit. We came in today as usual. - Our tanks broke through yesterday. - We weren't at work yesterday. As of yesterday I'm post commandant. Are you German? Clear out your desk. May I make an official report? - What do you mean? - I must report what's happened. He wants to call Berlin. Duty officer, please. - Capt. Schmidt. - Mjr. Behrend. I have an unusual report. We've just been overrun by the Russians. - Request permission to be captured. - What? The Russians have occupied my office. Russians there? Ridiculous! Could you tell him? Lt. Hecker here. I don't know any Hecker. From the Red Army... Are you drunk? The Reds are here and you're getting sloshed! Give me Mjr. Behrend! Listen very carefully. This is 1st Lt. Sikanyuk. And you are... ...a son-of-a-bitch fascist! A son of a Nazi whore! Please confirm. Glad to help. West of Berlin, our tanks headed south. Then we left for Sachsenhausen. - What are you doing? - Shooting him. - Why? - For hiding. So what? He's from a camp. We know for certain. At least explain what you're doing. Are you a guard here? Are you in the SS? Why are you hiding? Is the matter resolved? What did he say? - He's not a guard. - You believe a fascist? - I want the truth. - Seen the camp? - Do you know what went on there? - See for yourself. Let's finish this trial. What's going on here? - Where are you from? - Kiev. - I'm from Leningrad. - You liar! - Don't insult the people of Leningrad! - Go to hell! Drop it! Let's go. All but the dying and dead had been evacuated. The SS had moved the prisoners. We were too late. But we would catch the guilty. And then what? A SACHSENHAUSEN EXECUTIONER TESTIFIES I worked in the crematorium and gas chambers for two years. Could you explain how it worked? This held a bottle of hydrocyanic acid. This was closed. Air was pumped in here, and heated by the two boilers. The bottles were smashed. The hot air evaporated the acid. The gas entered the chamber. How long before death set in? It was very quick. I guess, about 10 seconds. Then they fell over. Their throats rattled and groaned. It was strange. We heard it all and watched through peepholes. And then they were dead. How was that done? Like this. Here, an SS officer would grab hold of the prisoner. He grabbed him by his arms and led him along the wall. He would talk to him to distract him. He put him before the mark. Then he lifted his chin so he was standing right here. He held him tight by his arm and told him to read the eye chart. Then the shot. What nationality were the people that were exterminated like that? All nationalities. Mainly Russian. For example, in two months, in September and October 1941, 13,500 Russian prisoners were killed in my presence. How long did you work in this death camp? I started back in 1938. Could you please explain what happened here in this camp? How could you live here? I was away for most of the year. I was away a lot because of my work. You are driving at something else. Perhaps you don't believe Germans. I hated life like that. Kant said, "It is the Germans' destiny to unite the good of all peoples." I own his complete works. From Reclam. I'm a landscaper. Enough! How about some music? You'd be right to shoot us all. We don't want to shoot anyone. Forgive me. I'm going to get some gas. Perhaps you underestimate the Nazi movement's irresistibility. It was a continuation of German history. You quoted Kant. But you misinterpreted him. The categorical imperative to obey any order an authority gives us was a trait of this people before Hitler. The need to fulfill our duties. This was just an escalation. An artificially induced frenzy of obedience. The result of long-suffered degradation. An explosion of sadism. A phenomenon. We have been destroyed, like no other race. I never got involved in politics myself, but... culture probably always has had a pitifully neutral place outside such events. At least in Germany. He's German too. His father emigrated. People will bring about change. Your faith gives your Germanness away. Your idealism is ingrained. In Russian I'd say this: A bad dancer is hindered by... his feet. - What does that mean? - I'd prefer not to say. These belong to me, now. Come on, play them. Looking for the Germany you only get in books? I'm looking for the Germany you can live in! Like I said, I never professed a creed. A people has its own fate. You can't judge it with reason, just like human behavior. It's terrifying, but it never changes. We can only try to interpret it. I'm glad for the chance to discuss this intelligently. The question is, can anybody, you or I, influence the course of history? Take war. It may be an anthropological problem. You won't like it in Germany either. You can't change a German. At the end of it all, the caesars rule, and view the barbaric past with disdain. But how? How could you live here? Truthfully. Sensitive people can only bear their existence through superficiality and detachment. You learn to be empathetic toward another's will to fight. You know what Heine said? Beautiful was once my fatherland, Where once proud oaks did grow so tall, And violets did so gently sway. Alas, I dreamt it all. Dreams kissed me soft with German words, How good it sounds: Ich liebe dich. I dreamt it all. Stop it! - Your eternal sentimentality! - Gregor! Leave me alone, you idiot! Berlin was encircled. Spandau still commanded the Havel River. We were given a special mission. Take some. Take the last drops! I don't understand. Read it once more. You get to go, and I stay here. Orders are orders. You know that. Let's go. Lt. Hecker. Come here! Take off your coat. Fit for rags! Forgot your flag? Chingis, bring it here! Thank you, Sasha. Attention! Two truce-bearers are approaching! Do not fire! Attention! Two truce-bearers are approaching! Do not fire! Begin! What do you mean, "begin"? - What is it? - We're truce-bearers. - What do you want? - We're the truce-bearers! Open up! Like Shakespeare! Col. Lewerenz, commandant. Capt. Gejman. We have come to discuss terms of surrender. This is my adjutant. I am here as interpreter. In order to prevent further bloodshed, we demand you surrender Spandau Fortress. We've been fully informed by your megaphones. Anticipating this demand, I've assembled all my officers because I don't want to decide alone. You won't understand this, but a German officer can only surrender if he maintains his honor. My adjutant will inform us of my officers' decision. It's a pleasant evening. The air is full of spring. It's unmistakable. In my first garrison before the Great War we had a park full of acacias. You don't need to translate that. Tell your superior here that SS officers are in the fortress. - What did he say? - He understood you. Glucose. I regret that my officers refuse to surrender. He wants to talk to them personally. I can't guarantee your safety. We insist. As you wish. Translate. This is your situation: We have surrounded Berlin. On the Elbe... ...Soviets and Americans have met. The war is over. Secondly, Spandau Fortress is also surrounded. There will be no relief. Thirdly, we know you have women and children here. They are your responsibility. I would say personally that we don't want to kill without reason. Do you know where Wenck's army is? Wenck's army has been driven back to the south of Potsdam. Our sources say that Wenck's reserves are now in Doberitz. Speculation. Were you there when the Russians and Americans met? Not personally. There was an armed confrontation. Talks between the western Allies and the Germans are nearly concluded. On a joint push to the East. That fairy tale is nothing but Goebbels' propaganda. The Führer ordered the execution of those who surrender forts. We shouldn't even talk to you. - Are you a Nazi boss? - Are you a commissar? Let's not discuss political matters. How do you know Goebbels is lying? That his so-called propaganda isn't the truth? What about our prisoners? The adjutant's gone. The commandant's keeping schtum. Read that out loud. Soldiers who surrender voluntarily to the Red Army will receive the following benefits, by order of the commander. First: extra food rations. Second... So you were lying in the cellar. Tell me exactly what happened. A tank came down the street. - I jumped into the cellar. - And then? The tank came up and stopped. I still had two bazookas and fired one. - Aimed... - The tank rocked, burst into flames. - You blew it up? - Yes. - Then what? - A man came out of the hatch. What did you do? I fired my last bazooka. On the man? - Then what? - His head and arms flew off. Geez. - You aimed right at him? - Yes. What did you get? A medal? - What? - A chocolate bar. The assholes! You useless bastards! Have you no medals left? I'll award you my Iron Cross. Your generation is Germany's hope. - Do you want a proper SS uniform? - Yes, sir! I expected nothing less. Take that one. Go on! They're better than any of you. So, what's your academic hero of a boss up to? Those Russians are smart fellows. - They'll fool him. - Not hard. - They're still talking. - I told you, they'll betray us all. We've pampered them for years. We fight tooth and nail. They sweet-talk the enemy. All we can do is hope that Ivan rips his guts out. Commoners hold out, but nobles give up at the first shot. It's no secret you can't trust Bulgarians and Italians. But when Germans agree to Germany's demise, it's treason. It's been going on for years! - Help yourself. - Thank you. We must shoot the truce bearers, right now. That's not so easy. Why not? I'll blow them away myself. For the sake of morale we shoot them where everyone can watch. Gentlemen. We've discussed everything but can't reach agreement. I therefore suggest this: Neither of us attacks the other. You say the war will be over in a few days. When Germany unconditionally surrenders we'll surrender Spandau. Did you understand all that? We need to reach a decision. And quickly. Could we go back and report? Back to headquarters? Or not? Okay. Let's put our cards on the table. You want time to save your honor. You lost that long ago. You have until 7 a.m. Then we'll storm the fortress. Allow me to accompany them. The Russians are coming! - Where are you taking us? - A different way. - Wait here a moment. - Why? Excuse me. I haven't eaten since yesterday. We're expected back. We have to wait a while. Did you say you were called Hecker? Related to the Heckers in the Sauerland? Hecker Tailors. There are Heckers in Liebenscheid and Rolberg. It's a family business. Anything to do with that? - No. I'm from Cologne. - Really? I was pretty close. When were you last home? A long time ago. I was home in winter. Looks bad with the bombs. It'll cost a lot. To repair it all. What will happen after the war? What do you think? You've already decided. Is he a Jew? Don't misunderstand me. I have no prejudices. He seems quite decent. We will now blindfold you. - Why? - The rules. I'm not familiar with these rules. I'm warning you! There's your bloody Shakespeare! You have to go that way. See you in Cologne! God permitting. German soldiers in Spandau! Negotiate before it's too late! You still have one hour... ...until seven o'clock. German soldiers of Spandau! You still have... ...five minutes! We would like to... ...say farewell. This is the second war I've lost. It was May 1. Fighting continued in Berlin. But our war was over. Buddy? Buddy? You're back? - Are you a tank buster? - No. They went for fuel. We ran out. I've been blinded. You came by car, right? I heard you. I can get by with my ears alone. It's morning, right? Got a smoke? I freeze at night. I can feel it when the sun shines. What's it like here? A long bridge. There's water. It's not German tobacco. Tastes good. I don't like French. It's too strong. Where's this from? Macedonia? The Caucasus. I was there too. Two months. Yes, we saw a lot there, my friend. My home is Magdeburg. Will the Russians make it there too? I don't think they will. Something will happen first. Are you still there? German firemen! Today, big day! May Day. Hitler, kaputt. We make music. There's food and drink for you all. Yes? Please join us. 995, 996 997, 998, 999 1000! 996, 997 998, 999 3000! Thank you for Spandau! - So let me try your pelmeni. - With pleasure! What are you waiting for? Come in, comrades! Comrades! Please welcome anti-fascists from Brandenburg prison. They are our guests. Comrades... Why are you waiting? Drink, comrades! Come over here! German comrades! This is Lt. Hecker from Cologne. You're German? Yes. And your name's Hecker? Yes. Do you know a Max Hecker? - He's my father. - Is he still he alive? Of course. - Are you Gregor? - Yes. In that case, you must know me. I often came to visit you. On my motorcycle! - I don't know! - Amazing! You're Gregor! There you go! It's your toast, Lieutenant. To my mother. To my mother. Gregor, what have you done now? I fell down, Mother. You don't watch where you walk. I think I fell down somewhere. You're clumsy and disobedient. You were smoking when you were eight. I think I must get up again. Drinking schnapps when you were 15. You did everything much too early. You must hang every single one of them. Nothing will change here if you don't wipe them out. It'll all happen again in 20 years. The general would like to say that he understands your feelings. But sentiments have no place in politics. And revenge is poor counsel. Especially for the future. How do I explain it to the children? How? - Children? - Yes. I'm a German teacher. I shall return to Kiev. How could Hitler become omnipotent? Perhaps one day the school books will tell them this: He was empowered by industrialists, big corporations, the German Army. The whole military clique supported him. They gave Hitler and the Nazis all the power he wanted to have. Understand? But how can I explain that to them? Goethe and Auschwitz. Two German names. Two German names in every language. It's my language too. Our units saw no more fighting. We went back to Spandau to support the garrison. Our first peacetime mission. Look at that, Kurt! - Is the manager around? - He's gone. - And the mayor? - He's in the woods. I've been appointed the new mayor. - Where did you come from? - Prison. Can you play the record again? Comrades in the trenches All sing along And silence the other song We're singing about the Jarmara Front Where many true brothers have died Fascist grenades Have whittled our ranks They tore in our line bloody gaps We covered the highway We shielded Madrid We held at Arganda the bridge The poppies bloom in Jarmara now They bloom in front of our trench As a carpet of blood the poppies hide The graves of the valiant who died One day forever and everywhere Wherever workers do gather The song of Jarmara all will inspire To battle with hearts set afire Whenever the hour of glory arrives When all the ghosts Of the world we do ban The world entire a Jarmara will be Like the struggle in February Are many soldiers like you returning? Not just soldiers. Young people? Young and old. What was it like here? I was in the service from 1941 on. Earlier I worked in a power plant. What will you do after the war? Schools are important. I think of them a lot. I'm going back to school. I only went seven years. Quick! I've found a ride to Oranienburg. I still have stomachache from yesterday! Quick, let's go. - You all just sunbathing? - Sure are. There we are. Put them down! Count! It's not really an interesting game. Feeling lucky? Unlucky at this, but lucky in love, right? - Have you seen any Americans yet? - We haven't got that far yet. No Americans here. His wife won't let him back in if he returns with no medals. So he needs a few stories about the Americans. Another game, Lieutenant? Stupid game! I'll beat you one day! Very well. And you, Lieutenant? No, we have no time. We have to keep moving to Spandau. Sit down, Sergeant. I got here a week after the battle. From artillery school. - Our convoy got stuck. - It happens. What are they doing? We've been here since yesterday. We've heard loud bangs coming from Berlin since daybreak. Shit! We have to let them by. What are they doing? T-34! 85 mm cannon. 500 horsepower. 35 km per hour, top speed. They're drunk! Don't fire back at them! They're Russian! Back, Chingis! Get in quick! Not now, please! The morning of May 3, 30,000 German soldiers who were encircled in Berlin managed to break our ranks to the west. Losses were heavy on both sides. The enemy wants to break through in three columns. They're heading west on dirt roads. The advancing troops are wearing stolen Soviet uniforms. They have stolen Soviet weapons. These three columns are believed to include a number of high-ranking Nazi officers. We are to show them no mercy. - You want to agitate? - Yes. - And you want my cover? - Exactly. You'll get nothing from me, friend. My men will settle with the Germans. I must draw your attention to our orders. We are to avoid unnecessary losses. Don't make me laugh. Were the Germans also given this order? - Go and agitate them, and not me. - That's why we've been ordered here. I'll wait here! It's been quiet here. I've seen no soldiers, but it was loud last night. We thought it was the Russians. - Can you get across? - Over the footbridge. She doesn't know anything. Should we risk it? Get some white cloth. That's enough! - We need white cloth. - Get in! For a flag. We want no war here. Gregor! The Germans are coming! Attention! German soldiers and officers! Why prolong a war which you have lost? Hitler is dead. Surrender, or you will not escape the vengeance of the Soviet Army. - They're scared. - Tell them more simply. Don't run away! Listen to me! Come to us! You're safe here! Where are you going? The war's over. Surrender, and you will survive. They're gone. Put on some music. I repeat: Go to the water. Cross the footbridge in single file. I repeat: One behind the other in single file! At the end of the bridge, put your weapons down. Attention! Throw down your weapons now! Come in single file with your hands up. Throw down your pistols! And your hand grenades! What are you doing? Get away! I hope you enjoy it. Reinforcements! Report why you're here! We've brought you four shells and self-propelled ammunition. Why on earth do I need all that? Clear out! Back! We had to cross Spandau Bridge. To open a path for the Führer. Dead people lay on the bridge. I ran over the bridge. Grenades exploded. Debris was flying into the air. When I reached the corner, my foot was hot. Do you want to stay here? - Can you make a list of all prisoners? - Yes, I can. - What's your name? - Willi Lommer. Where are you from? - You'll die laughing. Berlin. - Why's that funny? I could have gone straight home. You wouldn't have caught me. So why did you traipse along? Didn't you realize the war was lost? I knew that a year ago. Then I didn't know. Man thinks slowly. - Man thinks too slowly. - That's too true. German soldiers! Come to us. Don't run away into despair. Over 100 of you are here. Follow them. Don't wait. Who is the senior officer here? He wants the senior. Well, that's me. - Capt. Maass. - 1st Lt. Sikanyuk. Learn! Wise guy! I know someone over there. Can I go to him? Talk to him. Attention! Emil, listen... Go on! Wave if you can hear me! It's Willi. Willi Lommer! I'm up at the house with the white flag. Come over before you get killed. Someone's coming. Eight men. - And then we're leaving. - For Russia, right? It'll take a year or so? It won't be easy. You've already been. - Let's finish up. - Okay. They're taking their time. - SS! - They'll finish us off! At the last minute! - Give me a gun! - Get away! Germans shooting at Germans! Kiss my German ass! Stop, you bastards! You murderers! Why can't you stop shooting and murdering? Why not? We'll get you! We'll find you! We'll sniff you out, you damned bastards! I won't forget you! I'll be after you. Until you're caught. Until you're dead. Until the very end. Until you're gone. Until there's no place left for you. Nowhere on this planet. Until you can't shoot anymore, you criminals. Until you've realized that it's all over. Once and for all. Can you mail a letter home for me? It's not far from Alexanderplatz. I'll find it. Definitely. I'm a German. I was 19.
