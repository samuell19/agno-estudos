We are weak but the Lord is great We are sinners, but the Lord is our saviour Bless those who are behind bars Bless our Catholic listeners Bless our Spiritualist listeners Bless our listeners of whatever creed they might be beloved Father. Give your people solidarity Give strength to the weak Give words to the mute Give vitality to the depressed... ...and to those who had a hard day You can come in - Hello, David - Hello - It's been so long - Yes, Fawzi How wonderful, David You haven't changed a bit. As charming as ever Especially with this camera on me - it's a mask But you haven't changed at all What a compliment! I'm so excited That's good, David. I'm very happy David, I would recognize you anywhere Honestly "A friend and companion of my grandson, Fawzi" And she would surely have added: "Allah will illuminate your thoughts" "Let Allah protect your future" She would repeat this several times. You were very dear to her When your mother heard your grandmother... ...to whom even I, a small child, had to bend down - ...she was so small... When did I first speak to you? I wouldn't remember I'll help you - Let's see We used to take the tram together back home That's right Every day, we sat on a different bench in the tram We always took the same tram, the one that went to our neighborhood I think we became interested in one another riding together on the tram We knew that we both studied at the state school We were in the same class And we lived in the same neighborhood - Right There was a moment when, almost simultaneously... ...we started speaking to each other How interesting. It's starting to come back to me, you know. Remember? In the tram! Remarkable. And, from then on... The rhythm is very Brazilian, typical of Brazilian music Is that what you've been working on? The composer is very famous here. We even have a stamp in her honour Sociologically, she's regarded as a very advanced artist Especially famous for two works: 'Abre Alas' and 'The Carnival March' You're a singer What's "karum, karum-nhe"? "The spring, the spring..." And "sirum, sirum"? "...is beautiful, is beautiful" And "tzef, tzef"? Oh, that's... "Little bird", perhaps? No, it has to do with a line at the end of the song... ...which means this: People speak ill of a young woman... ...but her lover should not believe them Every man has the dignity of God's son... ...and of the brother of Jesus Jesus was a carpenter He worked with His own hands Jesus who gave His life so that we shall never die. Long live those who came here today!
