It's got your name all over it. Don't you dare tease me! Please. We'll see how you do. No promises. Now head home. Even you need sleep, all right? Yeah. Hey! We're all going to the diner. Okay, I'll meet you there. Go, go. I promise. Oh, no, no, no, no, don't even think about trying to get a job there.If you want another gig, try Planet Hollywood. The boys are way cuter. Come on, girl. Snuggle in. We have to help this young thing, or she'll get trampled. Thanks for today. Oh, no worries. We know how it feels. Sounds like you're a Vegas virgin. : Mm-hmm. I'm from Nebraska. My parents don't even know I'm here dancing. They think I'm waitressing. Oh, you go, girl. And you got a part in Rendez-Vous with us? That's amazing! How long have you been in Vegas? Just over a year. A year of way too many auditions, and way too many "no's." Oh, that's a word you never hear from men. Just from you, honey. : Listen, you have to push yourself every single day, because the reality is there's always somebody behind you, hungry for your spot. Oh, I'd never do that. Oh, yes, you would, and you better. It's what drives us. We are all chasing the same dream. To dance... for life! In the best show we can. Yeah, baby! Our routine is, we get up, we rehearse, we audition, we eat, we audition, we get hit on at the mall, then we audition again. : No, you have to get used to, "You're so beautiful, but you're not right," or "Seriously, dude? There's a ring on your finger." "You're married." Okay. Cry me a river. You're a natural talent, while we've all studied for years and can hardly keep up. Bitch. You bitch. Guess what? Tonight, we're celebrating. What? Okay, I'll bite. What are we celebrating? Kevin is giving me a shot at the lead. Oh, my God! Yes! Yeah! That's amazing. I've got to prove that I can do it. Oh, honey, you got this. I'm starving. Are you hungry? Excuse me! Kid's meal pancakes for everyone here. I'm paying. Anything you need, just ask. Thanks. How come you're the one with the big news, but I'm the one that couldn't sleep last night because I am so excited for you? Roxie, it's everything I've ever wanted. You're going to nail it. I know you are. Plus, Kevin wouldn't have asked you to do it if he didn't think you could. He's going to choreograph every move with you in mind. I just have to stay focused. That's the least of your problems. I don't have any problems. Ooh... There you go. : Wow. Ah, maybe you can lose focus. Hel-lo. Who's that? Wow. Keep your clothes on, sister. His name is Jason Griffith, but he goes by Blu. He dances lead in a Cirque show. No way! Went to Juilliard. That makes him way out of our league. Your league, not mine. He's a beautiful human being. All right, let's get to it. We'll be taking it from the first position. Let's go. : Ouch. That looks bad. No, it doesn't. I admire you. What, my ugly feet? Yeah, who doesn't love a cute callus? Ew. No, I stub my toe, and I'm out for a week. You just keep going. Well, if I wasn't in so much pain, I'd hug you. Well, your feet are too ugly. Hey, you remember that guy, Jason? No. Don't. I'm not listening. You don't even know what I'm going to say. Yeah, I do. You've got that look. What? You've got that, "Oh, I remember seeing that guy. He was so hot," that kind of look. It's written in Vegas neon all over your face.He's not your type. I'm pretty sure I know my type. Debbie, I love you, but sometimes, you date the wrong type of guys. Oh, come on, Roxie. This guy, he's just on the no-fly list. I think you should avoid him. How do you know? Radar! I got me some nasty bad boy radar. Well, there's nothing wrong with going for coffee or something. No something, okay? Just stop this before you end up in court again. Hey, I won that case, missy! And he owes me compensatory damages, but I decided not to initiate collection proceedings.Okay, Miss Three Degrees, not all of us went to law school. One more time in English? I'm sorry. The judges said that he had to pay me money for the assault, but I would have to go after him, and I decided not to because I just want him out of my life. Well, are you sure you don't want some of that money? No, Rosita, we don't. I never said "we!" There was no "we" in that conversation, okay, and there will be no "we" with Blu. Softly. And arms. Easy, easy. This should feel easy. ♪ Tienes vidita mia una mirada que me fascina ♪ No, stop. You're trying too hard. Well, I want to nail this. I know you do, Debbie, but you've got to relax. -Your body's too tense. - Okay, okay. All right. Muscles nice and loose. All right? Let's go again. Big breath. Five, six, seven, eight... Easy... Yes. Yes! ♪ Tienes vidita mia una mirada que me fascina ♪ Bye, guys. You looking for someone? Uh-uh. You are. Oh, really? Hey, I'm right here. I see you watching me the other day. Oh, my God. You're pretty sure of yourself, huh? Nothing worth doubting here. Well, I don't even know you. Then let's go for a walk. A walk? In Vegas? Not a dinner, not a date. Just a walk. Maybe a coffee. Okay. Cool. Yeah. I learn a lot about somebody by watching them move. I'm Debbie. Debbie Flores Narvaez. It's nice to officially meet you. I'm Blu. : So I heard you dance in a Cirque show. That's amazing. Yeah, yeah, I'm in "Love". Not with you. The show is called "Love". Maybe you will be in love with me one day. Well, hey... I want to see you dance. Yeah, I bet you would. I'm the lead. Oh, excuse me. I'm in the chorus, but I might be moving to the front. The choreographer is giving me a chance, and... By the way, your body is amazing. You sure don't waste any time, huh? I like that. - I try not to. - I like that! So you been here long? What, sitting here? You want my life story? Okay. I'm Puerto Rican. I grew up in Baltimore. I have a sister that I love. That's kind of boring. Really? You think my life is boring? Wow. No, no... Okay, I was a cheerleader for the Redskins for a year. -Okay. - I was. I want something real. Like, not your Facebook page. Something real. Let me think about it. Something real. Hit me. I'm smart, and sexy. Deadly combo. Yeah, and beautiful. Thank you. You're very welcome. What about you? Get real. Um... my goal is to sing. Oh, go ahead. I'll listen. I'm not going to sing right now. Sing! I am not going to sing right now! Probably a good thing, 'cause I'd pretend I didn't know you if you did that. Okay. You around for Christmas? Um, hmm... I'm thinking about going back home... Okay. But maybe it's worth it if I stay. Yeah, might be. Well, I'm sorry I'm not there this year. : NIt isn't Christmas without you. Well, next year for sure. I promise. I'm glad you're with Celeste and the kids, though. Are you eating enough? Ma, I'm fine, okay? Yeah. Okay. I love you! I love you, too. Hey, little sister. How's it going? I'm up for the lead in a new number, girl. That's so great! Well, Mommy didn't seem so thrilled. She just misses you. We all do. Your home is here, Deb. Right now, I have to do this. I can't give up. Be careful. It's a crazy city. Everyone thinks that, but it's not that bad. You'll see. I'm going to get you out here kicking and screaming if I have to, okay? That's a promise. Give me one sec. Oh, hi. Thank you.

Co-dependent is my word of the day. He's such an ass. Well, I... Don't say it. Honey, let him go. It sucks... because sometimes, he's amazing, and then, at the same time, he can be, like... A total dick. That's a little harsh. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're not texting him. : Guys only want what they can't have, okay? Just let him stew for a bit. : Yeah. I mean, how many times can the two of you keep doing this? Great show, everyone. Really solid. - You okay? - Yeah. Hey... have you seen Blu? No? Hey, have you seen Blu? He said he'd be here. Girl, do you know Blu? Yeah, my boyfriend? Hey, Deb, you seemed a bit off. You just said it was solid? What? Oh, God, tell me. I just don't think your effort was up to your usual amazing standards.If you're really serious about being the best, you need to be 100 % present. Are you threatening to cut me? I will if I have to. Maybe you're spending a little too much time with your boyfriend. Are you kidding me? What the hell did you say to him? Calm down. No, Kevin's right, Debbie. You and Blu fight all the time. You break up, you get back together... Kevin just wants-- I'm so sick of people telling me what to do. I'm dancing better than ever because he's in my life. Be happy for me! Things are really, really, good right now. Look, all we're trying to tell you is that we love you, and we're worried, and... Don't. We're done here. Butt out of my life. Just butt the hell out. Deb! It's me. Where are you? I hate this place. I'm going to come over. Hey, Mike. Hey, uh... he's not home. Really? Where do you think he is? Uh, I have... no idea. His car is here. Why are you lying to me? Deb... You're a bastard. What the hell is she doing here? Shut up, bitch. Why are you doing this? - Huh? - Stop, stop. You told me you loved me. I do love you. You're supposed to be with me! I love you! You know that! Listen, listen, listen... I thought we were broken up. Oh, really? We're not! This is how you show me you love me? You've been sleeping with her this whole time, haven't you? Blu, what is going on? Oh, my God, seriously, shut up! Why did you have to ruin everything? I trusted you. I hate you! Call the cops. Call the cops! Okay! Deb, stop! It's not what you think. I'm crazy because I love you. You know that? I stupidly loved you. - Deb... - Don't do that! You always try to make things right, and I'm so stupid that I keep coming back because you suck me in. You're like, "Oh, baby, I love you so much. Be in my video. We look so good together," and then you screw around on me? It's not right! It is, baby. You have to trust me. It's all good. What do I have to do, huh? Leave me alone. Baby, shh. Listen to me. I know you love me. Then why do you do that? I didn't do anything. That was Lisa. You know me and Lisa. She just... You're unbelievable. You're blaming this on her? It's all you, Blu! You're a narcissist! I'm calling the cops! No, no, no! No! No! Listen! Listen! I-I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Come on, listen. I know you love me. Why you doing this? Why you doing this? Stop! You're hurting me! When I need you, you're not here. Stop, you're hurting me. You, baby, you make me do this. I needed someone, and you weren't there for me. Baby, don't do this to me. I'm going to need a statement. Ma'am? We can't arrest him unless you tell us what happened.I love you, baby. Keep quiet. The neighbor said he assaulted you. You need to make a statement. He's a total bastard. I know it was hard, but you did the right thing by pressing charges.Even after all this, I... I'd take him back. I know it's crazy, but I... I love him. Debbie, please don't say that. It's the truth. He makes me happy. I remember when I first met him last Christmas. Right from the start, it was... it was so perfect. I don't know... He was screwing around on you, and not just with her, but with other girls, too. Well, part of me doesn't care who else he is with, okay, because when he's with me, he's only with me. No one else matters. Okay, listen. Do you hear yourself? My God, Debbie, he is not the right guy for you. You are way better than that! You are a strong, determined woman. Listen... No man who physically abuses you is the right man, okay? He could have done anything else other than hurt you. If you don't see that, then you need some help. Some professional help. Debbie, please... promise me that you won't go back to him, okay? You're right. I promise. Thank you.

Debbie, you have texted him, like, a hundred times. What are you doing? Nothing. It's over. I swear. Well, if you change your mind, you know where we'll be, okay? Hey, Debbie. Hey, Deb. We need to talk. Hey, girls, can you give us a minute, please? Look, I know you're trying, but your focus is just not there. I know. It's been rough lately. You know what? Excuses, they just don't fly with me.I need my dancers to be living, breathing, and sleeping this number, and I don't think that you are. I created this number for you. We are three weeks away from opening. Do you have any idea how close you are to losing this opportunity? Take Thanksgiving weekend. Go see your sister in Atlanta, and just clear your head. No, I... I need to rehearse, Kevin. I don't want to go anywhere. It'll be good for you. This is the last time we're having this conversation. You understand? Every ounce of your energy goes into this, nothing and no one else. Okay? I'm not seeing him anymore. Blu's out of my life, Kev. I swear. Kev, I'm in this. Blu? : Are you kidding me? Where are you? You're leaving tomorrow. I know, I know. I'll be home soon. - Okay. Okay. I love you. Hurry home. Hey, sis! Hi, Mami. I'm good, Mami. He plays the music, and it was a salsa. You have to eat something. Mom, I'm not hungry. What happened out there? Nothing. You never were a good liar, sis. On the contrary, I was the best. Ooh, the truth comes out. You are coming home to stay, yes? Mami, no. I'm just visiting. I'm not moving here back to Baltimore with you, okay? We're so happy you're here, baby girl. NNo se preocupe, mama. They miss you so much. Well, I'm a pretty awesome aunt. You were. That's a crappy thing to say. It's my really bad way of saying I miss you. Things okay? You wouldn't be here otherwise. Um... well, I have some things to work through, but I'm fine. I'm fine, sis. Don't worry. I love what I'm doing. Dancing is this incredible rush, and it's like the music takes over every cell of my body, and I can't stop moving. I love it. There's nothing like it. It's better than sex. No way. Yes, it is! Well, maybe a close second. And? NQue? Don't "que" me! Who is he? No one. Oh, I don't believe that for a second. I know you don't like to be alone. I'm alone. Mom and I worry about you, Deb. Please don't. It's a mother's job to worry. It's genetic. "It takes over every cell of my body." I just have to concentrate. You know, this solo, it's a big chance for me. Maybe Vegas hasn't changed you. You're still so determined. Just remember where you come from, Deb... where your home is, who truly loves you. Tu familia. I know. I know. Wow. You're here early. Yeah, I'm a dancer. The lead, actually. Listen... I know I've been a bitch, and I've let some people down, so it's time I got my act together. I'm telling you, I'm going to be the best dancer this town has ever seen. I'm glad I went home for Thanksgiving. I feel so good. I'm energized. I'm focused. Glad to hear it. Ready to do some work? - I'm ready. - Let's go. Let's do it. I was surprised to hear from you, I have to admit. Was it the 250 grand? Well, the money will help, but the assault charge happened a while back, so it's time to settle this, you know? It's more about closure. I want it behind me. I understand. I've been in contact with the opposing counsel, and they are not overly receptive. Did you threaten collection proceedings? Not yet, but my guess is that we're going to have to. Okay, then enforce a court order and collect the money. Okay. You know, I've got to say, if you ever decide you want to become a lawyer, you should give me a call. I could always use a good associate. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to my dancing. Lot less stress, I bet, huh? I wish, but on the plus side... the money sucks.

Tonight is for both of us. Thanks, Kevin, for having faith in me. Honestly... I'm ready. You're ready. I'm starving. You want lunch? Yeah, except you're buying, okay? After everything you've put me through... Oh, girl... Come on, you know what I'm talking about, sister! I heard that Alicia got a call back at the Mandalay. Good for her. I also heard that you may have had something to do with that. Purely rumor. Ah. You are such a mother hen. That makes me sound old. Oh, you are. Are you nervous for tonight? Totally. I got the butterflies. You're going to be awesome. I just don't want to let anybody down, you know? Well, you never have. Seriously? I've been a mess lately. It's okay. And a bitch.

I moved to this crazy town two and a half years ago.I got to meet my best friend. Oh, who's that? Oh, you have to meet her. She's pretty awesome. I love you. I couldn't have made it without you. Thank you, senorita. Well, it is only 13 more days to Christmas, so you better get busy and buy me something fabulous. Likewise. I want something big, and shiny. Oh, yeah, that's not going to happen. So, what are you doing this afternoon? Nothing. Just hanging out. Okay, good! Good. Good. Bye. Bye! Well, did she call anyone? Not me. I haven't heard anything. Where's Debbie? Dammit! She said she would not do this. She'll be here. Tonight of all nights! Where the hell are you? You already missed the first show. Now you're going to miss your solo! You are on soon! Get. Here. Now! Debbie, where are you? We are on in 10 minutes. You need to be her I hope you're okay. : Still nothing from Debbie? : Nothing. I'm worried, Celeste. It's been two days. : I know. I'll be there in a few hours. Call you when I land. : But the police are in charge of missing persons, and my sister is missing! At this time, it's just not something we're investigating. I flew all the way out here, and you've done nothing? Ma'am, all these people are missing as well. Look, over 200 people go missing in this city every month. Many of them come back by themselves. I'm very sorry. Check back with us in a couple of days. A couple of days? You've got to be kidding me.It's already been a couple of days. Oh, come on! You've got to do something. It's strange seeing this, like she had a whole other life I never knew about. Feels as though I don't know her at all. I just-- I just want to find her. It's our mother's birthday today. Come here. It's okay. You must be so scared. I'm terrified. I know in my heart Debbie's still out there. Okay? There's so many people willing to help. Thank you for being here. Debbie told me she has amazing friends. We love her very much. She was always a social butterfly growing up, popular in school. And a beautiful dancer. God, this is horrible. We're talking about her as if she's gone. She's not. It's been six days. She's coming home. Okay, let's get these posters up. Um... Kev and Alicia, will you two take the north end of the strip? Get the others to help you. I'm meeting Jon to do the south end. Would you guys do Fremont area? Remember, hit up all the studios, restaurants, anything you can think of. We've got to get some attention on social media, and, hopefully, the police will do more. Debbie's out there, okay? We're going to find her. Celeste, you're going back to the police station, right? : I just can't believe this is happening. She kept promising to get me out to Vegas, and she did. Here I am... No, I'm sorry, no comment. No comment. You don't seem overly concerned. These girls, you know, the dancers, they come to this city, and then, in no time... What the hell is that supposed to mean? That she deserved it? That she asked for what's happened to her because of who she is? I didn't mean it to sound that way. She's my sister! What can we do to help find her? You're the cops, and you're not looking. This is Vegas. People come here to disappear, and people leave all the time and never tell a soul. Look, I'm sorry, but... we have a lot of cases ahead of this one. My sister has been missing for a week, and I want the Vegas P.D. to do their job. If you don't, I'll tell the reporters outside. I'm sorry. Word has gotten out about Debbie. If you don't make this a priority, I will tell them that you're doing nothing, that you don't care. Just watch me. Somebody knows something. You don't even have to say your name. Just call the police. We all want to find her, and I'm going to bring her back. We love you, Debbie. Please come home. Debbie? Yes? It's Detective Nelson. We found Debbie's car. Is there anything that we could use here? Let me go! Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't let you in. Please, please! It's my sister! There's nothing here... just a makeup bag in the car. Then where is she? Right now, we're treating this as a missing person's case. It's always been that. I know that you felt that way, but we needed something more concrete. Her missing was concrete enough. You should have been looking sooner. I promise you, we'll let you know anything we find out. Yes, great. Great, great, great. Nice movement. Just work on relaxing. Look like you're trying to enjoy yourself, and, uh... big smile. Okay, let's try it again. Excuse me, Kevin? Yeah. Detective Nelson, Vegas P.D. Do you have a couple of minutes? Sure. Hi. I'd like to ask you a few questions about the disappearance of Debbie Flores Narvaez. : Okay. When was the last time you saw her? A week ago. It was around the time she was supposed to start in the lead of Rendez-Vous, which was odd of her to miss that night, of any night. Any hints before that, that something was wrong? No. She was on a high. She'd just broken up with her boyfriend, finally. She was in a really good space. Jason Griffith, right? Yeah. And what was their relationship like? Intense. They were obsessed with each other. You know, they would always fight, break up, get together, break up. He was controlling and manipulating, and I don't think she saw that, and that's what sidetracked her from her dancing. So she ended it? Yeah... well, so she said, but I don't know. It's like she couldn't accept the fact that he didn't love her as much as she loved him, and it drove her crazy. I think more than anything, she just wanted to be loved. Don't we all? I want all of Debbie Flores' credit cards tracked, phone records, everything, and I think it's time I paid a visit to Jason Griffith. I want to do everything I can to help find her. I appreciate that. I tried calling you last night. Yeah, we were out. We went out dancing. Right, baby? Yeah. It was like a date night. You said you saw Debbie the day she disappeared. Any word since? No, no, and it was that day. I was at home. She came by, you know, talked about nothing in particular. I hadn't seen her for ages before that. We just lost touch, that's all. According to her roommate, you and she dated earlier this year. Yeah. Yeah, it was good. We got along great. I didn't do anything to her. I swear. Like, why would I? I loved her. I wanted to help her career. I gave her a chance to even be in my video. This is so horrible. I hope she's okay, and nothing's happened to her. Why did it end between you and Debbie? Debbie wanted more of me, but my first priority is my career. She wasn't as focused as I needed to be, and she was just so hot and cold. Like, you never knew where you stood with her, and she would text me constantly. Like, hundreds of times. It was so intense. I had to call 911 a dozen times. Like, I'm serious. She scared me at times. : We haven't covered Winchester yet. Kevin was in Springfield yesterday. Why don't we do Winchester together? - Okay? - Okay. My heart skips a beat every time the phone rings. Hello. It's Detective Nelson. I wanted to let you know that... I wanted you to hear this from me. What's going on? : The Overton police department contacted us. They found a young woman's bodynear Lake Mead. Oh, my God, Debbie, no! : It's on the Arizona side. I'm heading there now. There's no positive identification at this point. So you don't know that it was for sure Debbie? : No. The woman's body was badly burned. It's going to be difficult to identify. We should know more by the morning. It's not Debbie. Coroner I.D.'d the body. My God. We were up all night! I'm sorry. It's always difficult to know what information to share, but I wanted to keep you in the loop. That poor family. It's unimaginable. As part of what we're doing now, we've interviewed people who saw Debbie the day she went missing. I've spoken with Blu Griffith. He's cooperating, and he says that he saw her briefly on the 12th, that she was in her car and she drove off, so maybe she left town. No! No. Debbie would have told us. We have record of a 911 call made from Blu Griffith's house back in October. He had assaulted her, and he was arrested. He had his first appearance in court on that charge a week before Christmas, but the charge was dropped because Debbie was a no show. Maybe that's why... No, we cannot jump to conclusions. Debbie and Blu are two very, very volatile people. I've got allegations that she stalked him and called 911, and then he called 911, and in the middle of this, they can't keep their hands off of each other. What about her lawsuit? It's a dead end. He's not a suspect. We spoke to his attorney. He says the guy left town months ago. I wish I'd come here sooner. I could have looked right away. I just... Hey, you got Blu. : Hi. This is Celeste, Debbie's sister. Hey. : I wanted to ask you something. The police told me that you saw her in early December, the day she went missing. Is there anything else you remember about that day? Nothing, uh... I just saw her in her car. Didn't she get out of her car and talk to you?:Um... nope, never said a thing. I'm really busted up she's missing. She was constantly texting me or calling me, but then it just stopped. Like, nothing. I want to help find her. I loved your sister. I'm sorry, hey, I really gotta go, okay? Why did you wait? I was afraid to call 911. I didn't know Debbie was missing until I saw it on TV. You said that you know Jason Griffith. He was seeing Debbie Flores. Yeah... and me too. I dated him last year. I broke up with him as soon as I found out, And did you know he was also dating a dancer named Lisa? Not surprising. It's what he does. He likes women... lots of women. You told Officer Davis that you saw Blu just after Debbie disappeared, around December the 14th, about three weeks ago now. Tell me what happened when you saw Blu. He and a friend of his just come by my house. That's all. Okay. I think that maybe the information that you have is making you feel uncomfortable... ...and I also believe that you do want to tell us. You're doing the right thing. They came by at night. Blu asked me to store something. He said he was moving and needed a place. I told him I didn't have the room... and I asked him what it was. He said, "Do you really want to know?" I told him I wanted to know. He said, "Debbie's in there." I didn't know if he was joking, but it really freaked me out. I said no. I said, "You need to leave." : Where did Blu go when he left your house? And you're sure it was a Vegas Truck Rental? Okay. Thank you. Roxie will be here later. We have some other areas to cover. I'm so worried. I want my baby home. I know, mom. Please don't give up hope. Vamas a llevarla a casa. She's my baby sister. Give my kids a big hug for me, okay? I will. : Te quiero, Mami. Adios. So we pulled rental contracts from all Vegas Truck Rental locations, and got lucky. Jason Griffith rented a truck on December 15th.Three days after her disappearance. Yup, and we got the truck's GPS record so we know the exact route from rental to return. Now, the night of the 15th, the truck stopped right here. Is that the woman's house where they said they wanted to store something? Yup. Blu stopped by her house, she said no, then they drove here, didn't move until morning. It's a truck stop. Then the next morning, the truck is up here. That's Bonanza Way. It's up in the north end. And what's this? Bonanza Way? Empty house for sale. That's all we know. Get a warrant for that house, and then there's someone we need to bring in. We know you were with Blu on December the 15th. We have a witness, puts you in a rental truck, and we know where that truck went. I didn't do nothing. You know where Debbie Flores is... because you killed her. I didn't kill her. I swear. Then tell me what you did do. What are you going to do for me if I tell you? I want a deal. You're facing a murder charge. What happened? Tell me what happened! Hey, Deb! Haven't seen ya in a bit. Yeah, hi. What happened with that show you wanted to get? Opens tonight. Wow. That's awesome. Yeah. Knew you could do it. Break a leg, huh? Yeah! : NIt was weird that she was there 'cause they had broken up. They were always fighting. I felt bad for her... and then... then I heard them going at it again. Keep your hands off me. The hell is going on? Let her go, man! Let her go! You okay? What the hell are you doing? It's fine. It's nothing. This is not nothing. You want me to get you some water or something? We're good. Deb, I'm sorry. Come on, come on, come on. Let's talk about this. : It was all good when I left. They were watching TV. : So you went out? Yeah. I thought I'd come back later. I should've stayed. I shouldn't have left. I come back, and he's alone on the couch. He was sitting in the dark, like... and she's on the floor... and he just looks at me and says, "You've got to help me. This is a change your diaper moment." What does that mean? That I had to help him... but I was scared... 'cause she was dead. Where is she? Tell me where Debbie's body is. Oh, my God. He wasn't lying. This is a crime scene. I want the property sealed off. Get forensics and the coroner down here now. Mr. Griffith, I have some questions for you. I suggest you don't make a scene. Not here. Not now. We talked to your roommate, Mike. What do you think he told me? It's not what you think it is. Then tell me what I should think. Um... I don't feel comfortable answering this without my lawyer, just because I don't want to say something that you tie into something else, or you switch, or change, or whatever, but if there's something that I could personally help you with... Did you kill Debbie? No, I didn't kill Debbie. You see, something like that, I'd rather answer in front of my lawyer, just at least have him present to let me know if that's even something I should answer. She did come by your house, though, right? Yeah. So she wasn't just in her car the last you saw her? She texted me like she always did. She said she was sad. I called her back, and then she just showed up at my house, said she wanted to go out. What then? : What's the problem, then? You know, let's talk it out, Blu. Come on! Talk to me, please! Just talk to me. I miss you so much. I don't care. It wasn't always bad. So come on, Blu, please! Just tell me... please tell me... I thought we belonged together. I'm done! I love you! - Keep your hands off me. - Come here! You need to go! Listen to me! What the hell is going on? Debbie, Debbie, get off! Debbie, get off of him! Get off of him! : So that's what happened. Calm down! : My roommate came home. NHe stopped her from hitting me. He got her some water, and then he left. You didn't want to be with her? I didn't have time for her, and she was just freaking out, like she did when she kept calling me and texting me like a crazy person. Like, you've got to believe me, she was like this the whole time we dated. She was obsessed with me. She stalked me, and she did other stuff, like the time she slashed my car tires. She was out of control, she did that with other guys too. I'm not concerned about that. I'm concerned about the night she died. : You didn't know her the way I did. I want to see for myself if you're getting my messages. They're all here. You're ignoring me. 'Cause you're constantly texting! Then respond! Calm down. - Don't touch me! - Calm down! Let go of me! I hate you! I want you out of my life forever. Get off of me! : Deb, listen to me! Stop touching me! Calm down! Deb, stop! : She stopped moving. She just lay there. God, I just wanted her just to get up. I mean... I kept-- I kept-- I kept telling her, I was saying to her... "Get up!" I loved her. I thought she had a gun. You saw the gun? I thought she had one. But you never saw a gun, and she never had one. I really loved her. I just didn't want to be with her. I told her it wasn't good for us to be together. Because you had too many girlfriends for any one to be special. You loved her so much, you killed her. It was-- it was self-defence. You're kidding. It was totally self-defence. She was going to kill me. That's why she came to my house. She was going to kill you? That was my assumption. I have a right to defend myself. She was coming at me. You're bigger than her, way stronger, and there's no way it could've been a fair fight. She couldn't have hurt you even if she wanted to, so how the hell do you see this as self-defence? You strangled her, and then did nothing to try to save her. You let her die. I freaked out. I knew no one was going to believe me... Not you guys, the cops... nobody. I loved her. I totally did. Um... but she-- she was just so obsessed, you know? No one knew what it was like with us. I'm telling you the truth, man. Look at me. I need you to look at me, Blu. That's not what happened, is it? Here's how I think it really went down. Debbie was at your house, and you argued. : Okay, come. Let's talk about this. We're not good. I'm in pain. You hurt my throat. I want to call 911. Don't call 911. The cops will arrest me. We're good. You two have to chill. : You knew you'd go to jail if she called 911. Is it safe for me to leave? : Your career would be over. We're fine. : You were protecting yourself. You had to do something to keep her from getting in the way of your success... But she wouldn't listen, would she? I'm in pain, Blu. I want to call an ambulance. No, do not call 9--! I'll call one for you. Seriously, Blu! I'm performing tonight. I'm in frigging pain! I want to call an ambulance. You cut her legs off, and then buried her in concrete. You twisted bastard. I'm all done here. Turn off the recording. Hey. We're going to transfer you to detention. Probably be a few minutes. You want more coffee or something? No? So you panicked. Must be scary to have someone you love die in front of you like that. Panic can make people act in ways that they never thought they would. I get it... and I think that's what happened, Blu. I think that panic took over, and you regret everything that happened, then and after. Right? But... what did you do with her body? I didn't know what to do. Mike helped me. He did that stuff. He was there right after she died. But what did you do? A couple of days later, we got a truck. I knew this house where people were away, and, um... well... we put her in a plastic barrel. No one would believe me if I told them. I-- I had to! Then we had to switch her to other barrels, so she could fit. We had to.
