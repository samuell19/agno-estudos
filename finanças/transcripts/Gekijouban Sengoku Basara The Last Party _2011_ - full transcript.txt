"Sengoku Basara" ll Warriors bent on conquest raised their battle cries all across the country. The one closest to conquering the country "Oda Nobunaga" was the Devil King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga ruthlessly destroyed those who would stand in his way. And he made no exception, "0-lchi" "Azai Nagamasa" even for his younger sister, O-lchi, and her husband, Azai Nagamasa. Through the actions of the Oda Army, fear and carnage spread across the land of the rising sun. "Date Masamune" Meanwhile, there was the One-Eyed Dragon of Oshu, Date Masamune, and a young Takeda warrior of Kai, Sanada Yukimura. These two, who recognized each other as worthy rivals, set out for Azuchi in order to bring Nobunaga down. The Azuchi Castle will be the Devil King's grave! We absolutely cannot hand over our future to a compassionless general! All we will offer him are prayers for the dead! --Yeah! --Yeah! And throwing their support behind these two, warriors from other lands converged on Azuchi in great numbers. From Oshu, Masamune's most trusted vassal, Katakura Kojuro. From Kai, the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen, and Shingen and Yukimura's trusted ninja, Sarutobi Sasuke. From Echigo, the War God, Uesugi Kenshin, and his devoted female ninja, Kasuga. Furthermore, "Maeda Keiji" through the agency of the Vagabond of the Maeda family, Maeda Keiji, mobilizing from the west, came Chosokabe Motochika "Chosokabe Motochika" and Mori Motonari. With their cooperation, "Mori Motonari" the encirclement of the Oda was complete. You finish this. I shall, though it may cost me my life. With the aid of the other lands, Masamune and Yukimura succeeded in slaying Nobunaga. After the fall of the Oda came one who advocated for a strong and prosperous country. A warlord who plotted to make incursions out into the world. "Toyotomi Hideyoshi" He and his strategist, Takenaka Hanbei, "Takenaka Hanbei" brought turbulent times down upon them once again. Masamune faced the Toyotomi's overwhelming strength and though he suffered a defeat, he set out for Osaka in order to make a triumphant comeback. And under orders from Shingen, who sensed the threat of the Toyotomi, Yukimura took a military expedition westward. Though their paths differed, these two acting to bring down the Toyotomi --Master Oyamada! --overcame numerous trials and tribulations, --Master Oyamada! --and each followed the path that he believed in. And when the Toyotomi were about to put the finishing touches on bringing the country under their rule, Mori Motonari, who was allied with the Toyotomi, moved to attempt a coup. As the situation threatened to grow even more chaotic, Yukimura, with the Satsuma Army at his back, successfully obliterated this menace. Meanwhile, in the land of Odawara, Masamune engaged Hideyoshi in mortal combat --No limit! --and just barely managed to emerge victorious. Blast off! With this, the turbulent times appeared to come to an end, but the Toyotomi's demise summons the maelstrom of war for a third time. Two men who served under Hideyoshi. One, who seeks to rule the country with his faith in the bond that people share, is Tokugawa leyasu. The other, who seeks to avenge Hideyoshi's death against Masamune, "lshida Mitsunari" is lshida Mitsunari. And amidst the tangle of ambitions of Masamune, Yukimura, and generals from other lands, the greatest battle these warring states had ever seen was about to begin! "End" With the Oda destroyed and the end of the Toyotomi era heralded, the ravages of the many wars brought upon the world of man sorrows and regrets innumerable. At times, this turned the souls of those left behind into a field of carnage burning with hellfire, cruelly trapping what should have been humble destinies and twisting them. And here, too, was one such soul. Lord Hideyoshi... Lord Hideyoshi... Lord... Hideyoshi! One to cry out in bitter lament. His name, lshida Mitsunari. Vie! Blazon your colors and let them run riot The fervor to fight finds its match Such is the way a bond was forged under the banners The one to carve his brilliance will have the era to call upon "Sengoku Basara The Movie - The Last Party-" Painted with ambition, savagely wild as a tornado The rainbow that gleams only at night ls so garish and yet so mesmerizing Breath bated, at the mercy of a gaze A spark that gives no quarter closes in To the heavens Rally to the soiree of colors and race that color to the pinnacle Hurtle the storm into tomorrow Bravo to the souls surging under the banners Sprint along that moment or your life will never ignite O he who carves his brilliance! Wake the era! I will permit no one to beg for his life! L-L-Lord Mogami! Our foe is not a large army! What do you mean by that? I-it is one man! Here, I had thought it was a large army, but all I get is one spindly man. If anything, you must take this as a favorable turn of events. Gentlemen do not resort to violence! I know all about you. Come now, my dear Ando! I don't know who you are, but let us get along. A sign of friendship! Some brown rice tea for us to get acquainted! As you can see, there are even some lucky tea stalks floating upright. And I hardly think you would do anything rash, given your overwhelmingly disadvantageous position. Be gone. Refusal will not be tolerated. Any who stands in my way is as guilty as he is. H"He? Have you not come here in pursuit of none other than myself, Mogami Yoshiaki, the amazing and clever Fox of Ushu? Your mustache makes you look fool enough without such drivel! Yip! The one I am after... ls me, right? Good spirit. You've got guts, coming to get revenge on your own, Toyotomi survivor. I came to welcome you. Th-Th-Th... This is what I was waiting for! I was waiting for you! How do you like that, my dear Yamada?! He is my dagger up my sleeve! The One-Eyed Dragon of Oshu... You haven't changed at all, old man Fox. A teapot would be a better fit for your sleeve than a dragon. You... You can do whatever you want with that gentleman. I'll wait for you. I-I... I am against violence! Lord Hideyoshi... This man, who must be held responsible for your death... Your permission to annihilate him! Who the hell're you? I have no name to give you! Marvelous! Fall to ruin! You will not get away with it! I will not let you get away with it! Not bad, but... Number One of Oshu, Date Masamune. Sorry, but honestly, there's only one man in all the warring states who can get the Dragon all fired up! Cool off. You won't defeat me with hatred. Raise your own banner first. Then, we'll talk. Let's fight for the right to rule the country. You see? The country can go rot for all I care! My greatest wish is nothing short of making you cease to live! If you want to mourn that wild monkey boss that badly, go visit his grave or something. You blackguard! How dare an evildoer go even further and insult Lord Hideyoshi by calling him vulgar names?! Keep it UP- Why you! Accept your execution at my hands! You will not get away with it! I will not let you get away with the crime you committed! Date Masamune! II Bill You have been all that I expect of my lifelong archrival. I admit complete defeat, Tiger of Kai. Thanks to you, this half of my life has been filled with a sense of purpose. You have my heartfelt gratitude, Kenshin. I shall entrust the future of Echigo to the Tiger of Kai. You are all to put your faith in this man and make every effort to serve him. Is that understood? My lord! Bear close witness, Yukimura. Someday, such a time will likely come for you as well. Yes, Sir! This is goodbye, my beautiful blade. Farewell, Kenshin. Lord Shingen! That is... ...Lord Tokugawa leyasu! You must not sever this bond, Lord Shingen! Lord Tosho... Is that you, Takechiyo? I am sorry I have not kept in touch. You have grown so much. I had thought so, but... Even then, you are still a large man. I am glad to see that you are looking better than ever. You look well, Sanada Yukimura. It has been a long time, Lord leyasu. Today, I have come to relay my intentions to none other than you, Lord Shingen, and you, Lord Kenshin. I, Tokugawa leyasu, have hardened my resolve to unite the land of the rising sun with the strength of the bonds that people share! "This will be the last time." All have said so and all have believed it. And thus, to this day, we have done the same thing over and over again. But no matter who comes to rule this country, someone else is sure to appear to plunge the world into the chaos of war once again. This world where those who believe in the future cannot live the future... I want to end it this time, once and for all! Therefore, you have led the way yourself, removing your headpiece and discarding your spear. Indeed. Rather than that the time is finally right, what you are saying is that we can no longer afford to wait... That is exactly right, Lord Shingen. Waiting any longer is the same as wishing for this country's ruin. Rather than the time being right, one could say that we have nearly missed our chance. Tiger of Kai and War God of Echigo, the two of you share a deep bond. If you would work hand-in-hand and lend me your support, nothing would be more heartening! Leyasu, I understand how you feel, but I doubt there are any who would heed you. It is true. If it were easy to gain support for this cause, everyone would have done so from the start instead of going to war. The only two who have listened to me are the Maeda Vagabond, who came to see me after hearing some rumors, and the Ogre of the Western Sea. But even so, I... M-My lord! Then show me that you can make it so. Thank you, Lord Shingen. Lord Kenshin. Let us meet again, Sanada. My lord! What do you want? Takeda's territory is expanding and I am about to become busier than ever. There is a matter that I wish to bring to you, my lord! Speak. Yes, Sir! Since returning from my journey to Satsuma and my battle with Mori, I have felt something lurking in my heart. But it was nothing more than an elusive, vague feeling and I struggled to put it into words. And yet, Lord leyasu expressed it through his very actions! You are soft, Yukimura. I must beg your forgiveness. Nonetheless, living in this war-torn world, everyone has given up on it to begin with... No, it is something that no one would even attempt... And Lord leyasu is trying to achieve it with his fists alone. His incomparable resolve has set my heart hopelessly ablaze! For the sake of the future, you have trained and honed your skills with the spears. Do you claim to be prepared, as of this day, to put them down? Yes, Sir! Yukimura! Yes, Sir! For you, that is how...! Yes, Sir! That is how it should be, Yukimura! My lord... Now that makes you a real warrior. After all that you have been through, that is no longer thoughtless youthful enthusiasm. That is the way a true human being ought to be. It is the duty of one who clears the way and forges the future on behalf of all of us! M-My lord! Only now that you have been plunged into the depths of agony many times and persisted in being a diligent student... Only now that you have acquired the spirit, skills, and strength of a warrior beyond compare, are you and leyasu capable of attempting to undertake this. Know that. I understand, Sir! My lord! Yukimura! My lord! Yukimura! My lord! Yukimura! My lord! Yukimura! Hold on a second! This is getting dangerous! My... lord! Yuki... mura! My lord! My lord! Yukimura... I, Takeda Shingen, have imparted to you all that I have to impart. You have surpassed the man who defeated the War God. I have entrusted you, beyond all doubt, with the spirit of the Tiger. Yuki... mura... My lord! My lord! My lord! I feel like he could've just settled this by retiring like a normal lord. Sasuke! There's trouble brewing all over the place. So, I guess I can make my report to you, Commander? "Oshu" Lord Masamune! You ordered us to ready for war and then left. Where have you been? The unidentified enemy force that has set foot in Oshu must be intercepted before it gets through Mogami territory... The enemy was one man, Kojuro. What?! One man? It was no big deal. I politely asked him to take his leave. He was a guy all worked up, driven by vengeance. A surviving... ...member of... the Toyotomi... Lord Masamune! N-Number One... Number One... Number One! Have you tired of your meandering stroll, Mitsunari? Date Masamune... I do not mind being belittled myself. However, carving up the bastard who slighted Lord Hideyoshi with impunity would be meaningless! Through my presence, he further profaned the memory of Lord Hideyoshi! I must vindicate his honor before I execute that bastard! I doubt many take the words of strangers to heart as you do. Whatever it is you wish to say, speak briefly and plainly, Gyobu. There is no knowing what foul trick the One-Eyed Dragon used to send the Elder Regent to his grave, but declaring that he would not fight a man who has no army at his back may have been an expedient excuse. That is all. You may have failed to bring him down, but you sensed your superiority and that sense must remain with you. Are you unable to put stock in that? If that were true... Then it would be even more unforgiveable! It would mean the brazen weakling played Lord Hideyoshi for a fool! You need not go to the trouble of leading an army to face a weak man. Better to prod your opponent to act and wait for him to come to you. I would make the preparations. I will leave it all to you. Do you not wish to hear the stratagem? I have no reason to question your actions. Fine, understood. All for the sake of master and justice. "All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony" Lord Masamune, you must not move so vigorously yet. Did you find out who that bastard was? Yes, Sir. Ishida Mitsunari. After he attempted to invade Oshu on his own, it appears he is now leading an army, attacking various lands. I am told he not only kills soldiers, but mercilessly slays the people, who are unarmed. After which, he leaves his banner behind as if to flaunt it. Wholesale murder, huh? Generals everywhere are now nervous and terrified. Reports say they fear and abhor lshida Mitsunari, referring to him as "The Great Malevolent Sansei." Kojuro. Yes, Sir. I'm going out there to defeat lshida. That time, I threw up a smokescreen with empty talk. I, the One-Eyed Dragon, tucked my tail between my legs and fled in the face of the enemy! It just means that the world is vast. Eh? There was the assassin driven by the need for vengeance and then there was the way you assessed and dealt with it, by retreating instead of fighting needlessly. As the man carries the weight of Oshu on his shoulders, it is entirely consistent with your duties. I did criticize you for acting rashly and going alone, but... Thanks to that, this land has escaped devastation and both the soldiers and the people carry on with their days as always. Never ever think that only one who has mastered the sword can rule the country. There is not the slightest reason that you should feel responsible for lshida's later deeds. I'm the one who baited him, telling him to come again under his own banner. I have to finish what I started there. In that case, just one thing. Next time, I will not let you go alone. The Great Malevolence, huh? It's true, that bastard was crazy. But... What was with that clarity in his eyes? The force believed to be the lshida Army had just begun its covert maneuvers, but in the meantime, in the hopes of advocating to generals from all lands and bring about the end of this era of war as quickly as possible, Tokugawa leyasu, Maeda Keiji, and Chosokabe Motochika were about to set out on an all-out cross-country circuit. Leyasu. Why do you make no move to avenge Lord Hideyoshi's death with me?! How could you think no more of the kindness Lord Hideyoshi showed you and leave the Toyotomi? Lord Hideyoshi was too obsessed with strength. If the Toyotomi had gone on to take the horrors of war out into the world, an even greater number of people would have died and been consigned to sorrow. You were by their side and what did you even see? Lord Hideyoshi worked to keep the land of the rising sun from ruin! To protect this country's pride! That is why he tirelessly fought and sought to grow strong! Listen to me, Mitsunari. I have seen examples set by more great men than anyone else. And there is something I have learned. Ironic as it is, that something wasn't valor in arms. One's strength is there to remain unused. Strength for the sake of protecting the bonds that people share. Strength that you acquire and hone single-mindedly, never to be used. That is true military might. Of all people, that is what I should have relayed to Lord Hideyoshi. And that I did not is my crime. It may have kept Lord Hideyoshi from his death. Do not be so conceited, leyasu! Your pompous preaching disgusts me! You are not Lord Hideyoshi! What can you possibly accomplish with your bare fists?! Face my sword stained with bitter tears and show me that! I came to talk to you, Mitsunari! As my friend, I want your understanding first! I have nothing to discuss with you. I have no friends! Why do you think so? Just as Lord Hideyoshi had Lord Hanbei, you also have... Do not speak of them so lightly! The bond between Lord Hideyoshi and Lord Hanbei was so deep, no mere mortal could ever comprehend! That's right! A bond! Those two shared a deep bond. So did Lord Hideyoshi and Keiji. Maeda Keiji... His was the act of folly to stand in the way as Lord Hideyoshi set out for Odawara. He deserves a thousand deaths for that! Such supreme self-righteousness! I will execute him after Date Masamune! I do not believe so! Keiji's act of placing his faith in the bond he shared with Lord Hideyoshi is an example for us all to live by in the future! Do not glorify someone who defied Lord Hideyoshi. Do not speak of Lord Hideyoshi as the past! Lord Hideyoshi was the one who should have lived on, clearing the way to the future with his strength, and forging what was to come next! Lord Hideyoshi was everything to me! Mitsunari! I refuse to engage in further dialogue. That man who stole away Lord Hideyoshi... I will never let him get away with it. I will hold the whole world responsible for trying to consign Lord Hideyoshi to oblivion! A beautiful field of flowers... Once I get lots of flowers to bloom, he said something really wonderful will happen. So lchi will work hard to get them to bloom. My brother is smiling, too. He must be happy- This is so good. Yes. Let us gather more and more, Lady O-lchi. I-I'm scared, Venerable Tenkai. You are so easily frightened, Kingo. You will be fine as long as you chant some prayers to Amitabha. If it's prayers, you chant them, Venerable Tenkai. You're a priest, aren't you? Not to worry. I will hold a service for them all later. Is all going to plan? D-Don't scare me like that, Otani! Everything will be ready shortly. How are things on your end? Mitsunari says he does not question me. You must be ever so friendly with the Great Malevolence. Trust is not something one comes by easily. The things I do are bound to be in his interest as well. It is merely that Mitsunari does not question this. Lady O-lchi, the Devil King of the Fifth Heaven, and lshida Mitsunari, the Great Malevolence... For the purposes of the true feast that I crave and the ruin that you desire, they are the best instruments one could ask for. For the finishing touches, we have Kingo here. What?! Okay - Just wait for us, Number One! Number One! Let's shake it up! Yoshinao?! Hey... Y-Yoshinao... Where did you hit yourself? A c-crow? What?! Hey, long time no see. Keiji! What are you doing here? I'm here for a quick visit with the One-Eyed Dragon. Is he doing good? Number One says he's going to finish what he started with lshida Mitsunari. We're about to go chase after him. Once we defeat lshida, we're going to go take down Tokugawa, too! What? Number One feels responsible. The lshida Army's rampaging all over the place and now, even the Tokugawa are getting in on it... I've heard the rumors, too, but there's no way leyasu would do something like... Hey, what's that you got stuck in your head? Huh? Wh-What's that doing there?! This is... ...a letter addressed to Number One. It's from Tokugawa leyasu! What?! I'm going to take a quick look. Oh, wait! But uh, that's... It's addressed to Number One... That's a bad idea! This is...! "I am Tokugawa leyasu. I am someone who sincerely wishes to rule this country with the strength of the bonds we share. I have traveled the length and breadth of the entire country and advocated to all the value of the bonds people share. But unfortunately, not one would take me up on my proposal. No matter how much the frequent wars have sapped our strength and how many times we experience the grief of losing loved ones, in this land of the rising sun there are none who will put their faith in the strength of bonds. The reality of that fact has become painfully clear to me now. Therefore, I have no choice but to change my methods. Though it pains me, it is precisely because I refuse to compromise my ideals that I have decided to resort to force. Ishida Mitsunari is currently on an unfettered rampage and I believe you now see that the Tokugawa are capable of the same. Perhaps this land of the rising sun, filled with people too small-minded to work hand-in-hand, would be better off being destroyed along with the brutal lshida Army. Such are the thoughts that I have begun to entertain. However, I also know that this is too rash of me. So, I would like to speak with all of you just one more time. To that end, I want you to all gather at dawn on September 15th at Sekigahara in Mino. To every warrior who fears for the future of the land of the rising sun, where we were born and raised. Tokugawa leyasu." I still find it impossible that Lord leyasu would commit such violence! After he toured the various lands trying to reconcile the country and got completely ignored, maybe he decided on brute force, after all. That's the rumor going around. Well, you'd normally find it fishy, right? Suddenly bringing up shared bonds and stuff in this day and age. That is not true! No... Regrettably... I can imagine that thoughts along those lines must be all too common. But that does not mean that Lord leyasu would do such a... The brushstrokes on this letter are a dead ringer, but... There's something about this that smells... It is definitely suspicious. That is why... No, it's kind of a tasty smell, actually... Like the smell of hot pot or... H-Hot pot? What bothers me is that the ninja squads I dispatched to various areas haven't spotted a thing and yet, the sneak attacks keep happening over and over. No one has seen a likely force on the move, but some place is attacked and overrun practically every night. Do they have some unprecedented weapon? Either way, I cannot believe it is something Lord leyasu would do. Lord Masamune! Long time no see. Where are you going looking all worked up, Sanada Yukimura? It has been a long time. I am currently on my way to see Lord Tokugawa leyasu. It's so like you to be driven by moral indignation. I hear he's grown pretty formidable. You just watch yourself over there. Oh, no, that is not it... I'm off to break things up for lshida Mitsunari. I was going to turn right back around after that, but if that's the case, I'll leave leyasu to you. Lord Masamune... I heard you've taken over for old man Tiger. Indeed. Excellent. Once we've each taken care of business, let's throw a party to settle things while we're celebrating. I would like nothing more than to settle the matter between us. However, on this occasion, it is not my mission to destroy leyasu. Eh? I am going in order to make certain. That the one devastating other lands, as if to imitate the lshida Army, and making veiled threats to bring us generals together at Sekigahara is not Lord leyasu. Sekigahara, you say? There's something I want to check on with lshida, too. Though, either way, it won't change the fact that we'll be fighting. Let's meet again, Sanada Yukimura. Come to think of it, this is where you and I fought for the first time, isn't it? You are right. How about it? What do you say to settling things right now? What are you say... Lord Masamune! If we hadn't met in this place, I could've resisted the urge, but... In my beef with that bastard, there's no cool or hot. One of us will win and one of us will die! It's a death match dripping with animosity! Had no choice! That's why I want to have this fight with you now! Sanada Yukimura! Lord Masamune... Commander! If I do not accept, it will surely become a lifelong regret! That is what my instincts tell me! Death Bite! Great Wheel! Who are you?! What's the big idea, Vagabond?! What are you two doing out here?! The country's fate hangs in the balance! Sorry, but this is none of your business! Move aside! I know full well I'm butting in. But I'm not backing down. Please do not interfere! Whoa-oh! Shit! Heads UP! I understand how you feel, but this is as far as it goes for you two right now. You are... I'm Maeda Keiji. This guy here's Yumekichi. You're the one who always gets the One-Eyed Dragon looking all keen. Sanada Yukimura of Kai. Isn't that right? How about it? Until the murkiness hanging over this country gets all cleared up, what do you say to letting me declare this match postponed? Oh, that's right. To me, you're always the goal at the end. And I'd almost forgotten about that. You've got my thanks, softie. What a refreshingly plainspoken gentleman! I shall wait, Master Maeda. Lord Masamune. "Lord Date Masamune" "Lord Date Masamune" Looks like I don't need to read it. I just have to go to Sekigahara to find out what's going on right now, who's behind it, and why. Sounds like the plan that'll get me everything. Yeah, probably. Chosokabe Motochika, who should be traveling around out west about now, and leyasu should both be rushing over there, too. Sounds like it's going to be one hell of a party. If that lshida bastard's the ringleader, I'll get to straighten things out smack in the middle of it all. Number One. Here... What's this? All of us in the Date Army discussed it and we want you to use it. You may get angry, but we got permission from Master Katakura and made it in a hurry. The old blacksmith was real stern about giving us his stamp of approval, so it took us longer than we wanted, but... This is for your fight with lshida... The Great Malevolence, lshida Mitsunari... Is he that powerful? --Number One! --Number One! Please accept it! Lord Masamune. Lord Masamune, your life... ...is the life of everyone of Oshu! Not bad. It's a cool accessory. I'll be wearing it. P The girl comes and it's dark as under roots. P ♪ Backs ashiver and hearts clutched close. ♪ P Devouring the innards are the roots that are his. P Um, O-lchi? P Moans of the dying, so like flowers. P W-Want some hot pot? P Open your gates, land and shrine of roots. P Kingo. I have unfortunate news. Huh? What? What is it? Everyone has found out that you forged those letters in Tokugawa leyasu's name. What?! The generals are quite angry and once they reach Sekigahara, it seems they have decided to kill Kobayakawa Hideo first thing. I-Is that true?! It's not, right?! I did like you said, Venerable Tenkai, so everyone would get along... I know your desire for peace better than anyone. But warriors driven by anger are beyond the control of a mere priest. G-Get it in your control! I feel sorry for you that they will gang up on you and torture you to death, but I doubt that you can avoid it. D-Don't say that! Well, let me think... Why not treat them to some hot pot? This endless darkness... Though I may carve death into his flesh, it will never be banished. What awaits me there is unvarnished nothingness. My second death! Mitsunari. Wield your strength to your heart's content. Let us pry open the world together! Are you ready, guys?! Yeah! Don't slack off! Step on it! Yeah! All right, let's ride on! Yeah! Ishida Mitsunari, if you really are the one waiting in the middle of all this, this time, I'll be the one to hold you responsible! Uh, um... Well... Th-They're all mad! I-I'm scared! What should I do, Venerable Tenkai?! Leyasu... Kingo, so it was you. I'm sorry, leyasu. I... I see. It's okay, Kingo. I know you didn't mean any harm. So don't be scared anymore. You watch the pot for me. Let's serve it to everyone. O-Okay! I am Tokugawa leyasu! I am grateful to you for responding to my appeal and for gathering here today! Thank you! Everyone gathered here have personally witnessed two great powers, the Oda and the Toyotomi, and how frightful they were. And I believe it is now carved deep in our bones that military might is something that severs the bonds that we share. Leyasu... I see! Only those who demonstrate their strength rise to power and survive. That is our war-torn era. But at that rate, the fighting will never end. We have seen the downfall of those who rely only on their strength, twice! There shouldn't be anyone here who wields their strength in the hopes of engineering their downfall! I'm Maeda Keiji of Kaga! Do you know why you all are so strong? It's to protect your sweethearts. Having the homeland you grew up in and the priceless things you value taken from you... How about we put a stop to all that? I am Sanada Genjiro Yukimura of the Takeda of the land of Kai. I have been on numerous battlefields and I have fiercely crossed swords with countless warriors. The end to which warlords bring to bear their valor in arms... The thing they have their sights set on after the country is theirs... That, for everyone alike, is peace. With the hearts of true warriors, devoid of private ambitions or greed, let us join together with Lord leyasu and Master Maeda and seize this moment to speak in earnest of the future! Sanada“. Let us protect the bonds we already share and forge new bonds with our former foes and those who were unknown to us, and grow from there. Come, let us all share Kingo's hot pot and speak of a world at peace. --Sanada Yukimura... --Maeda Keiji of Kaga, huh? It's the Tiger of Kai... Wait! Hold up for one second! Before we do this, let's get to the bottom of who was leading all those raids everywhere! Ishida Mitsunari... It's the Great Malevolence! It's the Great Malevolent Sansei! Mitsunari, I've been waiting for you! Come over here and you talk to everyone for me, too! Do as you please. Do not draw me into it. A true shared bond is a miracle. The resentment and hatred of one who has been robbed of that joy will never be erased by the kind of sugarcoated words that you spew! "All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony" Mitsunari! So you were in collusion after all! We've been deceived by Tokugawa and lshida! Why you! We almost fell for it! Hold on! That's not how it is! What foolishness. Bonds are nothing more than invisible threads. Man cannot help but quarrel with one another. To fight this natural order is the act of a fool. To all of you pawns who have gathered here at Sekigahara, cut down every last unfamiliar face you see! Anyone with a different banner is your enemy! Be the last one standing and the country will be yours! This is the battle that shall determine the fate of the country! That is Mori Motonari! I am not one to be slain by a mere sacrificial pawn. I see! If I survive to the end... ...the country will be mine! Mine... That Mori. He is an unexpected agitator. Thanks to him, the battlefield will churn even more. I have made the preparations, so feel free to kill as you please now. You have my gratitude. Go. Onward. Commander, we can't keep fighting defensively anymore! Sanada Yukimura! I guess it was a momentous decision for you to take part in this gathering, but it's time to accept reality! What will you do as the general of your own army?! To eradicate the root of all evil, here and now in Sekigahara... To every man in the Takeda Army! I order you to fight back! Understood! Good! This isn't giving up. Even if you get hacked apart once or twice, if you're serious... Live through it and take up the struggle again! That is exactly right, One-Eyed Dragon. And when that time comes, join us. Too bad for you, I don't like making nice. I'll probably end up fighting with you, too, someday. When that time comes, I will face you with these fists! I, Tokugawa leyasu, will not let the land of the rising sun become a deserted country! It's to protect our bonds and ties of love. I guess I'll treat myself to a little contest of strength! Kojuro. Yes, Sir. Men! Date Masamune. What ignoble means did you employ to murder Lord Hideyoshi? Ishida Mitsunari. What about you? How many innocents did you drag into your vendetta against me? What's the big idea with this crazy free-for-all? Such things do not matter! I will hold responsible any who think no more of Toyotomi's influence! "All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony" And especially any who dishonor it! So the only successor he's got is this one miserable bastard. That boss monkey's totally got to be rolling in his grave! Recant every last bit of abuse you heaped upon Lord Hideyoshi! I will hear no other words from you! Repent and die! Hell or Heaven! X-Bolt! Be carved to pieces! With this, they will all die at each other's hands. Mori's entry into the battle was a most unexpected stroke of good luck. His intent was a surprise attack, when in fact, he is helping us. Even the exceptionally clever general does not seem to have noticed this. The Great Malevolence's bitter hatred for those who have forgotten Toyotomi and Tokugawa leyasu's honorable idealism, wishing for peace for the whole of the land of the rising sun. These choicest, unadulterated ingredients look like they will make a tasty hot pot. The one who whisked it all together is my puppet, Lady O-lchi, the Devil's younger sister. Wh-Who's this woman? Mitsunari, you must be happy as well. You declare that you will hold this entire world responsible and to your eye, this must truly be a transcendent sight. A-Are we really going to get peace this way? Mori! You bastard! Long time no see! Inciting an uproar and aiming to profit from the sidelines, eh? Your methods are dirty as ever! Eh, Mori?! Hurling insults at your adversary, while beaming joyfully like that... Chosokabe, have you become a different person in the time that I have not seen you? I'll temporarily return the land of Aki to you! I'll beat you into the ground here and take it back all over again! Return it and all will be fine. After your demise, Shikoku will surely become Aki's distant little island. Keep yapping, you bastard! You tarnished Lord Hideyoshi's rule! You stole from me the one and only light in my life! Hang your head before Lord Hideyoshi! Beg and plead for forgiveness! And then, be beheaded! Once you're done with this revenge, what will you raise your voice for then? Come at me with everything you've got! This is your climax! What?! What is the matter, Gyobu? Pay me no mind. I realized that even those who have died once can die again and I was merely struck by that impermanence. Why... you...! If you've died once, then all the more reason! Bring that strength to bear to live your life! I'll bring that death wish of yours to an end! Jumping Jack Breaker! What do you think you are doing, leyasu? Both hatred and anger... The cure to both things is bonds, Mitsunari. I believe... you... I told you not to be conceited. I did not ask you to help me. Go die... in some ditch... somewhere... Don't say things like that... so lightly, Mitsunari... Look at that, Gyobu. The Great Malevolence has finally been dragged into leyasu's farce! As an appetizer to the feast, I could not have asked for anything better. Let's all make them bloom. Look. Not much longer now... You guys, watch out for those black hands! Don't touch them! Curse that Kingo. Blathering on needlessly. The venerable Tenkai said that it was to unite everyone's hearts as one! He said sacrifices had to be made for that and... He's a priest, so I thought what he said was right, but... In the end, I think it's wrong! It looks like you were too late, Kingo. These black hands look familiar! Lady O-lchi... What the hell is that? Moans of the dying, so like flowers. --Open your gates, land and shrine of roots. --Open your gates, land and shrine of roots! I have awakened and returned! Offer up all that you have and bow your heads! Rejoice! Followers of... ...foolish greed! The Devil King of the Sixth Heaven... Is that... Oda Nobunaga?! We haven't seen him in a while. I don't know who cooked this up, but it looks like someone used you guys to get this surprise party going. So... it was all for this? To all, I say, regale me and do your duty! He's got unbelievable power... It is incomparable to before... Putrescence drawn up by the black hands of the Fifth Heaven will form the Devil King's new flesh and blood and blanket this world in death and destruction. With this, all people will be equally reduced to worms writhing in the dark abyss. Stop this... I absolutely refuse to permit your savagery. At this rate, the world that Lord Hideyoshi aspired to rule will be destroyed! Lord Hideyoshi's dream... Lord Hanbei's hope... I will not let the likes of you erase them! A grasping monkey and his tail without a cause. Such frail souls, not worthy of eternal scrutiny. Revering a feral monkey obsessed with strength is supreme folly. Hup! Useless fools! You will never... get away with this! The rightfully abhorred Devil King... I will not let the likes of you... ...take Lord Hideyoshi's... May you be reduced to ashes! Impertinence! Gyobu! What are you doing?! Why are You here?! Get back! Get back, Gyobu! You need not suffer any more! Know it to be futile! Gyobu! I had not realized until this very moment... So, the way you saw me was the same as the way I saw you... That no one in this world could be more unfortunate. A hilarious circumstance... Gyobu! Gyobu! I will not permit you to die! Gyobu! What a clichéd way to make amends. In the end, it turns out that you were a mere mortal as well, Gyobu. Mitsunari, take a good look at Nobunaga! During Toyotomi's era... In the eyes of the people, how Lord Hideyoshi... How we appeared to them! It cannot be... Those are... Are they the Devil King's roots? So those countless black hands serve as the Devil King's roots? The Devil King has not been fully resurrected yet! If we cut him off while we still have time... Kojuro. Understood. Good hunting. Sasuke, I place you in charge of the Takeda Army. Roger that, but... Do I get paid for being second in command? Now's our only chance. I'll leave the rest to you, Kojuro. My lord, please forgive me. I, Yukimura, am going to sacrifice myself for this country. Toshi, Matsu, I wish you happiness forever. With faith that everyone will forge their own bonds after I am gone... Wind, Forest, Fire, Shadow, Mountain, Lightning, Water! Smile, pale dawn of the east! Snatch and cherish tousled hair! It's the One-Eyed Dragon! Oh, I can finally fight to the death with you, Lord Nobunaga. I cannot be destroyed... For I am already destroyed. Ichi. Do not run away, lchi. Now is the time to pay close attention. My lord... Nagamasa? Why, Lady O-lchi, you were still here? You played your role well. I, Tenkai, shall deliver you to the depths of Hell. Huh? Oh? Um, am I... ...shifted to one side? Yes. P-Please wait one moment... Don't... Don't eat me! I am not tasty! Oh, but not there... Eat that... last! A Devil has fifty years! Lord Hideyoshi... For the unsightly death I am about to die... I beg for your permission! The crime in the blade, the atonement in the sheath! Mitsu... nari... I felt not the slightest irritation! Now is the time for atonement, lchi. You are the only one who can do this. My lord Nagamasa... Brother... Lady O-lchi! The Devil King's... younger sister? Come to sleep with lchi. Keraku... You simpleton... lchi will stay by your side forever. Wh-What comfort I feel in these arms... This was inevi-- You guys! Tadakatsu! Hey! Do not forget your crime of robbing Lord Hideyoshi of his future. If you ever expose yourself to be the unsightly little snake, I will execute you whenever that may be. Refusal will not be tolerated. Excellent. It'll give me more things to look forward to. So you are Maeda Keiji. Yeah. I have a request. What is it? If it's anything I can do, just name it. Someday, I want you to tell me the story of the Lord Hideyoshi I never knew. Sure. Any time. No problem. Lord leyasu. What is it, Sanada? If I were unable to carry out my resolve upon this occasion, it had been my intention to relinquish the title of Tiger. Thinking that perhaps the one who was truly worthy in the next generation to succeed the spirit of the Tiger was you... I have always looked up to Lord Shingen as my teacher in spirit. And I will continue to do so. But you are different. The bond you share with Lord Shingen is probably thicker than blood, something deeper. I want you to put your heart and soul into carrying out your duties and pass it on to the next Tiger after you. Very well. Mitsunari. I will wish for you and I to someday unite the country with the strength of the bonds we share. Carrying on the ideals of someone for whom you feel undying respect is also a precious bond. I will take no part in collusion. That is so like you. Then how about we settle this with brute force? Fine. Let's treat ourselves to the party we've been waiting for, too, Sanada Yukimura. There is nothing I would like better. Good luck. Farewell. All right, everyone, this is the honest-to-goodness last big fight! No hard feelings now! Let's settle this! You're tougher than I thought, Mori. Foolishness. Strategy and valor in arms. There is no way I am lesser than you in any of those areas. Putting up a front, eh? You can't wait to be put out of your misery. It's written all over your face. I'll settle this for you with my next move! I imagine a pirate would be happy to go to a watery grave. Turn that anchor of yours into a grave marker at the bottom of the sea. The battle between the warlords continued without end. Lord Hideyoshi. Lord Hanbei. For the brash act I am about to commit, I beg for your permission! I will carry your teachings in my heart for the rest of my life! Will the one to emerge victorious on this battlefield become the supreme ruler of the warring states? Or will these turbulent times still not end, even after this battle upon the field of Sekigahara? Let us forge bonds, Mitsunari! I know that you will be able to forge stronger bonds than anyone! Because you are capable of loving someone with your entire heart and risking your life for them. So I'm certain of it! Only the bonds shared by these warriors and their fiery souls know the answer! One-Eyed Dragon, Date Masamune! I will now fulfill the oath we swore on the summit! Be satisfied! Don't let me reach the goal too easily, Sanada Yukimura. Unrivaled Spear of World Domination! Sanada Yukimura is here! Number One of Oshu, Date Masamune, pressing on! Cool and wild suit a bewitching night under a hazy moon In devouring grace, I'm as good as any out there For the trigger, snap your fingers Send up a flare or nothing gets started Chasing down, getting in too deep, I'm done for My way of life, drawing blades Even casts the shadow behind me in darkness Pitched forward, sober, I invited, “Don't be cheap, show me the future" Party On! Burning Soul!! It's priceless There's no end to the festival burning up Let's Dance! Warriors!! Straight up, the world's going to hell Super flashy means business, right? On the rise The one to master the decisive battle wins Keep the party going I'm prepared for what's to come, but... Every last one of them's way too desperate Looks likely my destiny'll get tied up, too, so I brace for a different fate I see myself in the rich colors and briefness of the burning sunset From the back of an unruly horse The tail's to the east, which way is tomorrow? Party On! Burning Blood!! I dream a lasting dream Drunk on awakening, I can't stop Let's Dance! Warriors!! Let them get away with it this time Sitting back and watching, I make a mistake At the decisive battle, I grab on to a burning hot Shooting star With my way of life, drawing blades Show me the passing time! Party On! Burning Soul!! It's priceless There's no end to the festival burning up Let's Dance! Warriors!! Straight up, the world's going to hell Super flashy means business, right? On the rise Party On! Burning Blood!! I dream a lasting dream Drunk on awakening, I can't stop Last number one!! Don't hold back this time Radiant enough to embrace the era The one to master the decisive battle wins Keep the party going
