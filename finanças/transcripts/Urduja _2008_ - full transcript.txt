Let's go. Let's finish this. Mayumi will be angry again. Oh, the dance. Gundong! What's that?! He he! Who are you Barbecue? Wait. Are you in this dance? The people want me to join you, princess. Because they say we are a good match. - Huh? So, I thought you wanted to join me. That's easy for you. Slowly sir. Father, - Urduja. This is nothing. It's too bad. You didn't finish your dance. Never mind father, the next time I fight. That's what I don't want. That where you are going is into the jungle, alone. I'm not looking for a fight. They come to me. That can't be the reason. You know the status. You alone are... Didn't t you make my mother a warrior? Your mother was a worthy leader of the Tawalisi tribe. You and your man share one heart. I feel like I know where this is going again. You need a strong man that will guide you and our tribe. Who is that can...? You called me dear Lakanpati. But if it's mine? I will lower the trunk in front. Then behind too. If you really want it, it's up to you. - Really? That's also what you'll wear to wedding with Simakwel. - Ewe! I don't want to! Why? Is Simakwel still chosen by your father? And you intend to obey your dad? You know I can't say no to father. It's just sad that he thinks more about the future of Tawilisi than happiness for his child. Simakwel, I don't really feel him. What? What did you say? I don't feel like choosing him, even though my life is already defined. If only mother was alive. Because you are only looking for a fight. You know, when you least expect it, someone grabs your heart. Oh not anymore. I don't want boleros and cheaters. So who wants this? You? I want it. So? Are you still? - Mmm Hmm. - Hurry up Limhang! Wait! One more, handsome. Hey Kukut. It stinks. Oh boss, what did you say? It stinks! I forgot to bathe earlier. It was cold. Six plus six plus three... We're not fooling around. Let's go back to six. Okay okay boss. 17! - 19! 20! Ha ha ha! This is mine! Ahem! Wait a moment. Oh my gosh. It's hard to get lucky. It's late, how do you do it. I'm out so I can go bathe. Bye bye Hey! Wait. What is this? Both are the same suites. You know what that means. You're really doomed here. What's that? That's what I'm saying. We don't play with people like you. Here we hang cheaters upside down. Alas. You are... - Looks like me. It's a good thing this happened. Otherwise we have no hope of ruling this tribe. Don't worry, no one else can be chosen you but you. Maybe we can get rid of all the competiton. You need to do just that. If you don't you'll be skinned. Boss will take this. But there is something else. Kukut, my sword. Yes, that's right. - Quickly. There. Here. - Thanks Boss. Hey. Come here! I'm going to kill you! You are going to be killed. - Does my breath stink? I almost fainted. Is this what you are looking for? My former captain. Here we are, still in luck. Well. Let's see. You stay there. He's mine. You heard him. No one interferes. What are you waiting for? Get him! My clothes! He's close! He's close! You move! Quickly, quickly, quickly! There will be no retreat, we will fight against everything... We have nothing without the ship! What are we going to do? I'm too hungry to die! Kokut, stop. Stop it! We are far away. - Why? Do you think they are waiting? Is it ready? - On your order sir. - Aim! Fire canon! Watch out! Daisuke! Let's hurry and lower the sail. Hold on, I'm coming to you. Good work boss. - It's dangerous. Too heavy. Too heavy? That's the problem? Comrades, we are too heavy, throw the barrels of gold into the sea. Hey because the boss said so. Wait? What are you sying boss? Clean house, stop or it's Wang's Sword for you. I can't! I don't want to! No I don't like this life here. Don't take it away! No no no no no! That's it. Ride on.. Bey bye Kukut! Don't forget to write okay? Gerneral. There are barrels overboard. Look, they're full of treasure. The pirates are desperate. Let's just go ahead and retrieve the barrels. That's not enough for them to pay me. Go away then, your first payment was delivered. My jaw is full of lumps. When we are stuck, who is stuck? Kukut is! Clean house. Who said that? Kukut did! It's up to me. How is your plan? Kukut knows how it is. This. Yes! haha! Finally! Smells like a roasted rat. Take care, good bye my tail! Was my plan okay? - It was okay, we'll need a wick next time. Hold it good. What am I doing back here? I speared an insect yesterday and missed. Why don't you put the insect here? You moved! That's why I'm still alive. One more so. - Huh? No that was okay, right? Let's go home. Urduja! Tarsir: Ahhh! Stay there. How many times do I have to tell you? Cook first then clean the house. Where is my breakfast now? You said yesterday that I should put the house first. You answer back huh? That's your size, Buyong. The one who cooks you breakfast will actually have lunch. Let's fight. She's my wife. You don't know anything! - If you married her, you shouldn't treat her like that. You don't seem like a man. - How do you know? Is this yours? Sack him! You'll have no complain to dad? - The one who complains has a big ton... Urduja don't. Urduja. But alas, you see the life of Paraya and ten women here. That's not reason for you to interfere in married life. If it's a sin to hurt another person, it's even more sin to exploit the person you are supposed to protect. Our tribe has the same law even if I can't do anything. If so, when will the law be changed? Or replace the one sitting on this throne. Father, that's not what I meant. Don't worry, I've been preparing for the descent for a long time. What do you mean? - I talked to Simakwel. I have agreed to marry you to him. He promised to take care of and promote the welfare of our kingdom. Girl, please understand me, my child. I'm a girl What should I do? In the world we live in Where is my limit? I'm a girl Do I have power? Or I'm just a spring That source of love I want to fly with my own wings. I want to reach my dream quickly I want to lead the sparrows To see the new morning But when? I want it Now I have anger But hope is in my heart Tomorrow you will see the fog He will stroke the butterfly... The butterfly I want to fly with my own wings. I want to reach my dream quickly I want to lead the sparrows To see the new morning But when? I want it Now Where is the music? - Wretched is the happy world, a prisoner of his crown, slave of his kingdom. Tarsir it's alright, don't pity her. There's something new here Gundong! We are going Gundong! Not that! Not down sloppy! What the heck? Hey! Wait a moment. You're a meathead! You are stupid! And that's it, where are you going to take the Pongkan, huh? You can't do that! How can you steal it!? - Where? there? - Here I said... There! You said so. This place is beautiful like paradise. It's a shame if you... Don't worry we won't be in this place for long. How many days have you been without sleep? It's better to rest first. I'll check the place first. See ya! You'll be looking for a hang out place again. Me?! When do I just hang out? Right? Wait wait wait wait Gundong! I'm wet with your saliva! Ah, because we are delicious. What does it taste like? It looks delicious. I'll take care of it Gundong. They seem to have no education. - Really? I was a little scared. Was a little scared. Not mine. There. Crazy. What will you do without me? Hey rat! Why are you taking here without a greeting? Don't you know that when I own the land of ... Wait wait who are you? I am the king of fruits here. In this place, I will take those fruits. Which fruits? There! Hey! - Ouch! You're broken. King of the nose, that's from the ship, not the one picked here Where is that now? Here, on the ground. Okay, isn't that mine? Hey! King of the monkeys! Who's a monkey?! You were here when the ears were big. - Oh oh oh oh! What a rascal! Who's mad? - Who's mad? Who's talking? If it's not worth it, don't bother. - What's that? If it's not worth it, don't bother. If it's not worth it, don't bother If it's not worth it, don't bother. Listen. If it's not worth it, don't bother. If it's not worth it, don't bother If it's not worth it, don't bother. If it's not worth it, never mind. Tat means, what we are fighting against? There's no going if something doesn't make sense at that time. If it's not worth it, don't bother. If it's not worth it, don't bother If it's not worth it, don't bother. If it's not worth it, never mind. If we are both ugly. - You are ugly. What's the trouble? - Oh what? Nothing will happen either. - Nothing really. Even if we are still. - We're tired. If we look like feet. It's better to go for a walk together. Let's go. If it's not worth it, don't bother. If it's not worth it, don't bother If it's not worth it, don't bother. If it's not worth it, If it's not worth it, Oh. Why? Never mind. Why? Never mind. Hey! Never mind. Hey! Never mind. Hey oh. Oh. Wait. Good day to the better young lady. Who are you? Get out of here. That was a very cold reception for a guest. - I don't invite men to my bath. Oh why not? The air is hot, the water is cold, I'm kind. Do you know the death of the one who insults the son of... - Wait, wait, Wait. Who's insulting? Just continue with your the bath. What's wrong with that? Anong pangalan mo? Nasan ka na? Hoy! Yoohoo! Ddon't hide anymore, I know you like me too. I'm Lim....uh uh. Don't say your name, I might remember. It hurts to talk with you. Besides, why are so conceited? It's good that I'm still paying attention to you. Wait a moment. Can you? I don't lack attention. Maybe you? So even if you don't get what you want, you force it. Move here! Are you hurt? Chow? Princess! Are you right there? Watch, it's not him. Princess Urduja what happened? Chow. Waiting under the tree, help me. There is a wounded man. The boss! Boss! What happened to you? Told you. Don't stay away from me. What is... Did the boss come back? Even if it's Kukut isn't here too. Something happened to the two of them. As always. General Wang, I think you had lunch in the bath. It's going to be like that... Help him Hurry. Yes sir, yes sir. We speak well, my soldiers. I will chase them. Do not worry. There is no poison in the arrow. - Thank you. But why? Perhaps from extreme hunger and pain. - If it wasn't for him, I would have been hit. He's not just handsome, he's also brave. Wait, where did you get this? In the stream while I was bathing. - Oh! He's not just a gentleman... Princess Uduja. The king ordered to summon you Alas. You are dead to your father. - Urduja. He can't stay here. - Father, he caught a spear for me. I owe him my life. Urduja, we don't know this man. The man is recognized by his work Simakwel. It's up to us. You know the danger brought by foreigners. How is he? - Napa ... - The arrow used by the batiaw is seriously poisoned. And if the medicine is not applied... - The date flowers. Date flowers will not be available in the morning. Find a flower Urduja. Go with her Simakwel. - I will follow. And by the time he could walk, he will return to his destination. Princess. Where can we fing the flowers? You know, where there are visitors. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. - Because you came. Well, it should be. What if there is an attack of the ... - The mosquitoes? You always make fun of me. When will you fall in love with me? - Is it still necessary? You got father's feelings. Your acceptance of me is more important. You will be my partner in life and will be the mother of my children. It's good for you that you plan my life. All our thoughts about your father are for you Urduja, for your happiness. Date flowers. Finally Daisuke, someone is coming. It's Wang. He followed us. Lower the sail. Let's hide in a secluded place. Bossing, let's get out of here. People here are scary. The lime is really good. And we don't eat rats here. Hey! It'all you and your Princess. You don't see my boss. Am I not right? Am I not right? Hey! Hello! It's your boss who is chasing Urduja. How? He drinks like you do. You are the one who will be charmed. Maybe you know! You face looks like a witch. Look at it this way. Are you crazy? Look in the mirror. You won't be touched by witchcraft if you look like that. This is bad. We need to let the others know. I thought you would only wear it when you got married. I just remembered mother. - Your mother often stayed up when you were sick. Really? - I've been watching you for a few days now, I just see how worried you are for a foreigner. It's not good to swell your feelings with someone you don't know very well. I'm just looking try repay the debt. - That's good. Get some rest and tomorrow we'll talk about preparing for your upcoming wedding. Thank goodness that the boss is good. Thank goodness the Princess helped him when he got hurt. Is she nice? Oh, there is no one like her. There are no enemies here. Really? - Yes. Everything is fine. You know, my boss doesn't have that, my boss is plastered all over. He doesn't have any enemies either. No, it is increasing every day. We're fine, I think we'll get along. What do you think? No problem put 'er there. My only problem is that your princess will let go of my boss. - But she won't... Looks like it's already set with the princess. It's going to be handsome and boss is handsome. - Only! My boss is getting married. So there is no hope for your chicken. - It's not clear What will I do? What? Say it! You speak! Eat his tail. Come on son. Where are you snake? - Why don't you ask the person next to you? Kukut! I'm coming. I thought they don't eat rats here. - They don't.. Didn't you see? He spit you out. This is a beautfiul place. They call it the pearl of their birth. Pearl of their birth? Hmm. It's far from where I'm going. Just don't listen to me. I'm grateful, aren't I? Didn't you notice? This place is rich in gold. I noticed that not only is there a lot of gold, there are also a lot of fools. That's the combination I like. Looks like you're planning something else. I smell something cooking. Here. Let's go fast. Eat Surprise! Ouch Nevermind. I can do it. You shouldn't get up yet. This is nothing. - Nothing? You were delirious last night. Last night? I was really worried. Uh, we, we,we were worried. You know, the herbs were bad. I hope you didn't stay awake watching. Uh, I didn't stay up. Then why are your eyes droopy? Uh, oversleeping? And you shouldn't have caught the arrow either. I saw it. I didn't share that I stumbled. It looks like a happy place for you. Do you want me to show you around? Oh! maybe... I can do that. It's worse here since I'm alone. Ouch. You must be fine. Your wind is moving. I'm like that, are you like that? He was handsome and his bones were strong. I liked him right away. This was your fifth boyfriend? No this was the seventh. The fifth one, I pushed over the cliff because he was already married. Limhang! Daisuke! - They followed us... Yes, I'm here. Here he is. He's my friend, Daisuke. She's Urduja. The second best here. But I'm Mayumi. - And I'm Daisuki, uh... Alas! You seem very hungry and I have cooked Pinakbet. Come on Go eat. That's really a different kind of... We love you boss! Simakwel won! Bring it boss. Don't try to understand him. It's a buffalo race today. We do this every day after six. You seem to enjoy your stay here. And you were even invited. Simakwel By the way. I am Simakwel. Chief of warriors I am... - I know. Isn't it Limhong? Limhang. - That's the same. You seem strong. - Thank you and I also want to thank your king. He is sick and has no passion for foreigners like you. Simakwel, he is my guest. - Sorry princess. If so, let me invite you to the race. Maybe you can. I can. Until where? - From the square to the embankment. Around the edge of the forest and back. - If I win? Stay here until you grow old if you want. But if not, go away. And take your friend with you You can't yet. - I will not retreat. To Limhang in this fight. Hey what's that? Do not be noisy. They're with a Chinese. Does he look good? I don't know. He's wounded. I know. Let's test him with a joke. We'll watch. Buyong. - We will take care of it. I can't be wrong. Wang followed us. - That dog's smell is really strong. We have to leave here. We can't leave either. They are on guard. We are safer here inside. When you win, we'll be out on the water. - I'll be there. Daisuke! Limhang, be careful. Simakwel is cunning. He doesn't fight fair. Boss, because that's what I taught you. There is a shortcut next to the black stone. Just avoid the mud. I'm not afraid. You will be there. Me? Boss I'm pirate not a cowboy. I'm allergic to things with horns. I'll see you at the finish line. Right here. This is it Wait wait. Not my tail. Hasta la Fiesta Baby! What happened to you? Dizzy. - We have medicine for that. Do you now? Good for him. I will not pay I was cheated! - The one who suspected is the one who did it. Did you see that Urduja? Isn't he going to be banished now? Botyok! Botyok! - Hey wait. Where are they? It was just a joke. Let me go! Wait. Wait a moment. Just a child makes you so angry. - You don't know what you're holding. That is the son of king Chow. He should be killed. Calm down, we'll take it to father. Botyok, where is he? We were watching the race. Sometimes we throw guavas at as a joke. Botyok got caught. Call all the warriors. We will attack the Tawalisis. Father is still sick. He left the decision to me. - This is our chance Urduja. But my friend... - You are not my friend. And if that toddler is the key to our success I will not beg to kill! You will reap not victory but endless vengeance. - That is the law of the world. Blood for blood! - I want that the child be returned home. The blood of an unconscious person will not be shed here. But they may just now be preparing to attack. We need to... - I will help. - You don't have to get involved in this, it's our problem. Your problem is my problem. Good day to you Sir. Now how. I'll get you something to drink. You are from Pihong, right? How did you know? You are not the first from Pihong to arrive here. There was a pirate, who stole gold from Chow. They thought we were the ones who stole. That's where it all started. With a foreigner? So you can't blame me if I say people like you will do no good. But... - When you leave, I hope you'll be the last. Human life, is an endless creation. There is no rest until suffering is over. Hopefully, hopefully. We've crossed many oceans and also took many lands unconquered. In search of true happiness. And she chose me. But why? When she is done teasing chaos, I hope to learn in the middle of the war. I hope to be brave too, as long as I'm with her forever and ever until death. I am with you my love. Excuse my father. What he said is right, it's hard to trust someone who isn't your kind. Is it like that for you? Before it was. - And now? Now? I can not understand myself. I'm being pushed away, I'm still not leaving. Because of you. - Me? You don't even want to admit it. What can I admit? Go ahead. - What is it? That you love me too. - It looks like the poison hit you badly. Oh my gosh. You hit deeper in the heart. Hey! Just try again. Try it ladies. Back off! Back off! Come back here to the back of the mangrove. What's going on? Limhang! Let go of me! - Don't! Daisuke! Why? - Urduja. Simakwel took the child. Simakwel. Let go of me! Ouch! Ouch! I'm dead. Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go I said! Badjao tribe! Don't! This is the day of our victory. Simakwel! Don't! Let go I said! The rope is rotten. - Boss I'm coming! Are you okay? - Chicken. Dad! Dad! - Wait. Who's your dad there. Dad! I can't quite imagine that a foreigner will bring peace to this land. The cute ones like us are also useful from time to time. I also learned a lot, new methods, new perspectives on life, new feelings. Sometimes new things are scary. - Why? Like lightning, you come as fast as you leave. - If you've found what you are looking for, where will you go? Here I was driven away by the wind that had been listening to my leap for a long time. Here. With you. My heart will find you Urduja. I'm not looking for anything else. Princess. Something happened. You are needed. Urduja. It happened suddenly. He was just happy watching earlier. Urduja. Father. Father, - My child. I'll get some medicine. - Don't. But father. I am happy to leave, I see that I had been waiting for a long time. You hear that child? Your name is being whispered in the wind; Urduja. Follow your heart. Father. Father. Boss? We have no problem, the king is dead. - Dead and someone else took his place. Don't worry, we have a solution for that. It's okay, boss. - What's okay? We're not shaking hands with that Chinese, you added more. Wang, those pirates are Limhang. Pirate? Look again I've been staring. - General Wang had been looking for him a long time. - Wang. It is necessary to talk to him first. - Come with me, he is waiting. There is a thorn in your side. - Can you remove it? Such a problem should be handled carefully. That pirate is cunning and slippery. - What's on your mind? I want him to surrender to me. And why would he give up on you? - Because I will destroy your tribe if not. What? Why you! What a beautiful thing you think. - I think it's really good. You're here. I think you are avoiding me. Not really. Things have changed. - Where? Here? Look again. Nothing changed. I'm still who saw in this stream before crying. Now in spite of everything I'm happy. There is something you need to know. - There is nothing more to know. I see enough now. What you see is a lie. You are not at the funeral, Simakwel. Are you drowning in grief? Even though I am not honoring the beloved king, the tribe is still on my mind. You have nothing in mind but yourself. - And you see nothing but the beating of a blind heart. What you are facing now is a deceiver. Why don't you explain the truth to him. That you are a suffocating pirate, that even now China looks down on, to attack this tribe in search of you! Urduja. Don't worry I will leave. - What? Will you leave us alone too, pirate? Should I think? Maybe we should not have met, and not have to suffer the anguish of moving away. I do not understand. I will be taken on purpose. I can love you. for now goodbye. I have to think more. I'm used to falling. Love never ends, happiness is greater. Thank the stars thank you for meeting me. Because when you love, you also know I love you Any time, whenever. and not goodbye, forever. I'm waiting, even if it takes a long time. In my heart, only you are my beloved. I love you Any time and more so, forever. I am Wang. I'm just a simple person, I just want simple things. The plans are simple, I'm not ambitious. As long as I'm happy even when I'm asleep smiling, that means indulgence. My little whims like it simple. He just wants simple things. He just want simple things. I just want simple things. I just want simple things. That! I want that. This and that. That's all mine. That. I just want to get what's around us that doesn't have a view so I can be heard from here. Okay, it's nice to have a beautiful bed. It's okay to grab just one and every king is delicious. What about each of you? is it too much to ask? It's good for me, for your hard work. With the sweet sweetness, with your fish sauce. This is the happy tax, it's yours to leave. It's simple, isn't it? Not that. - Didn't you say? You'd wear it when you get married. I said I'll only wear that when I marry the man I love. And great art! You will just commit suicide. I'm going to put it on, I'm going to tighten it so you can't breathe, this hill is different. The return of the Kukut. Limhang, Limhang - Daisuke. I told you so. Limhang come the ship is ready. Hey why aren't you happy? Simakwel and Urduja are getting married. Did you hear? The unhappy will be beheaded. Is there anything that can stop Urduja? You know there was an earthquake. Your attendance is appreciated. Dear princess Urduja and I, Simakwel, will unite in love and will be kings of this land. Princess. Wait. I'm being called. - Piraya! Princesa, accept the sign of my oath that I will love you as long as I live. And will serve as the king of Tawilisi. - Yay. I don't want to. There is no reward. Simakwel, accept this as a sign from me that you - Stop the wedding! You came back. Where are you? Go away, go away, go on, go on. Who are you looking for? It's Wang. - I'm here Wang. You can't save me anymore. Just the same. Wrong. Go back your house child. Attack! Attack! Kill them! And don't let them escape! Let's go boss. What shall we do? - What else? Not side with the enemy. Huh? What did you say? Come on! I think one passed the grade here! You stay there. Simakwel! - Urduja! Don't! That is how to catch a rat. How about what we talked about? - What talk? You are beautiful, I will benefit from you a lot. Limhang Limhang I'm going to lose my mind thinking about how I can repay you I know. - Don't. - Kill them all! Hey! Not her. She comes back with me. Daisuke help them. My gosh. Huh? Ouch. Let them go you giant tree! Do you have nothing now? But little toddlers? You're sniveling huh? Aim here! Down here. Urduja! Urduja! Urduja behind you! Urduja! This one is relevant. Limhang! - Urduja! Hey you are at the helm, good at the mask, you will be lazy before me, I can't be the master and commander of enterprise! Okay men? Then don't complain!

This one is mine! How can this happen to a pirate? - He is gone. Just you and me.
