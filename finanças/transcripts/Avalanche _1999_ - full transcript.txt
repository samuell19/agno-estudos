[FOOTSTEPS] We expected you yesterday, Mr. Snyder. You kept us waiting right down to the wire. I like life on the wire. SOLDIER: Yeah. [DISTANT DOG BARKING] [CHUCKLES] [GUN CLICKING] That's life on the wire, Mr. Snyder. [GUNSHOT] [FIGHTING SOUNDS] [PLANE ENGINE STARTING] Let's go! Let's go! [TIRES SQUEALING] Now, Duncan! [GUNFIRE] [TIRES SQUEALING] [HORN HONKING] Do you believe this scenery? This isn't exactly the same old views that we see day in and day out. [GAME SOUNDS] Very cool! I made level four. Max, will put that thing down for five minutes? All right. Five minutes. See that peak? Mt. McKinley, the highest point on the North American continent. It's great, Dad. Five minutes up yet? I don't believe you guys. Dad, just take it easy on the sales pitch here, OK? Deidre, we see each other so rarely. Let's just have a good time. [WIND BLOWING] Hope you guys brought your long johns. It gets cold out here at night. It's pretty cool. Did you think I'd bring out to some dump in the middle of nowhere? Remember Mexico? I wasn't asking you. I asked your sister. 4 o'clock, everybody. "X-Men" is on the tube. - Max? - What? Here, make yourself useful. [BIRDSONG] I'm glad you made it up here. Beautiful place. Pretty remote, but it grows on you. Let me get this straight, no TV, no VCR, no dish. Man, don't you think you're taking this mountain man just a little too far? That's right, Max, no TV, no VCR, no satellite dish. And if I had it my way, no video games. This is seriously primitive. Look, I had to lay down a sizable damage deposit, so I'm asking you not to treat it just like home. MAX: I'll try not to trash it! Been a great six months for me up here. I've really been able to focus on the book. No distractions? No. This place is the greatest, no noise. No people. (READING) The causal relationship between weapons technology and battlefield strategies in medieval Europe. Wow. Call me crazy. I find it fascinating. You, um, just about finished? A couple more chapters. But, uh, I made time in my schedule for you guys. [LAUGHS] Well, you never know. You might hit the bestseller list with this one. You think? Good news, Dee, we got running water. [LAUGHS] [OWL HOOTING] [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] Hey, how you doing? Find. How do you like it up here? It's cool. I like it. You really let your hair grow. Yeah. DAD: It looks good. Thanks. [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] Goodnight, Dad. - Goodnight. [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] [OWL HOOTING] [KNOCKING] Busy? Can I come in? Uh, sure. Looks like you're all moved in. Yep. Your mom told me you did real well on your SAT scores. Congratulations. Oh, well, I could've done better on my math. 1450 gets you into Stanford. That's what you want, right? Yeah, right, I guess so. [SIGHING] You know about Mom, right? Hm? She's-- she's seeing somebody new. He's an engineer, Gordon. Mm. Seeing him? Just seeing or-- Actually, he's moving in with us. Is he a nice guy? You like him? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. He's pretty nice, yeah. So it's OK with you then? Yeah. How about you? Yeah. I'm OK with it. OK. Brought you an extra blanket. Here you go. DEIDRE: Thanks. Goodnight, Dee. Night, Dad. [OWL HOOTING] [AIRPLANE ENGINE] I'm gonna take us in over Highway 69. There's a strip just a few miles past the mail run. They keep it clear all year round. It's not more than four or five miles hoofin' it from there to Denali. Hey, Whitney? WHITNEY: What? Smile. Say cheese for the camera. Cheese, Duncan. [CAMERA CLICKS] [CROWS CAWING] Something smells good. Hey, what you doing? What's it look like? Hey, you sit. Come on, honey, let me do that. - Dad, it's fine. Yeah, well, I know where everything is. Dad, it's fine, really. Well, here let me set the table. It's done. I'm fine. Max! [CLANGING] Vittles! [CLANGING] Anyway, what I was thinkin' is we can get us the 4:15 to Anchorage. And we'll meet the clients there, and then-- well, you know? And then adios, amigos. Hey, Whitney. What? [GUNSHOT] Mm, wake up, sleepy head. Well, I'll tell you one thing. You're a better cook than your father. Mm. Dee, this is exceptional. Oh I am so glad. Yeah, I thought we'd pack a lunch today, strap on some skis or snowshoes, and go exploring. What do you say? - Sure. Where to? Well, anywhere you want. Pick a direction. It's all gorgeous. You do realize I'm missing "X Man?" [LAUGHS] Max, you're such a slug. [LOW RUMBLING] Well, I would say we head up this ridge just an hour. Spectacular view up there. Any wildlife? Well, lots of caribou in the valley below. You really seen them? Once. We'll keep our fingers crossed. [RUMBLING] [RATTLING] [RUMBLING] [RATTLING] Dee, let me-- [CRASHING] [SCREAMING] Ugh! [SCREAMING] Ugh! [SCREAMING] [CRASHING AND RUMBLING] [SCREAMING] Dee! [SCREAMING] [CRYING] [PANTING] DEE: [CRYING] Daddy! Dee? Dee, I'm coming, baby. (SHOUTING) Max? [WOOD FALLING] [DEE CRYING] Oh, my god. Dad, what happened? (SHOUTING) Max? DEE: [CRYING] What happened? I don't know. It's like half the mountain comes down. Here. - My leg's stuck! - Hold on. I'll get it out. Get you some leverage here. Wiggle it. [GRUNTING] Are you OK? You hurt? DEE: No. Max? (SHOUTING) Max! [CRASHING] DEE: (HYSTERICALLY) Max! Max. [PANTING] Max? Nope, not here. DEE: Come on, Max. [CREAKING] Max. Max. Max? Max? Dee. Max, [PANTING] you hurt? Come on, you're OK. (SHOUTING) Max! Look at me! You're OK. You're OK. MAX: Dad? You're OK, Max. Dad's got you. Yeah. Yes. Good boy. Good boy. God. God, we're buried. [CREAKING] We're buried! [CREAKING] What are we gonna do? OK, we're gonna be all right. Dee, I'm gonna check upstairs. Look, there are more flashlights in the top kitchen drawer to the right of the stove, candles too. You'll get them for me. I'll be right back. OK. [CREAKING] [GASP] [CREAKING] [CREAKING] Are you guys OK? Look, we're gonna be fine. I think I found us a way out of here. We'll dig our way out from upstairs. First I call for some help. [CRASH] Dad? Dad. [CREAKING] Dad? Get-- get out of the car. The ceiling's going. Mayday. Mayday. Anybody? [RADIO SILENCE] Mayday. Mayday. All stations, this is Brian Kemp. There's been an avalanche. We're buried under it. The Mitchell cabin, five miles west of Highway 7 off County Road 218. [STATIC] Mayday. Mayday. [RADIO SILENCE] [STATIC] [SIGH]. I'll try again later. We're fine. We're fine. We've got food, warm clothes, and a way out. And we'd better get started. Here. Come on. [CREAKING] [GRUNTING] Ah! [POUNDING] [PANTING] We're gonna need to keep this landing clear. Dad, I can help. There used to be a broom up here somewhere. See if you can find it for me. Go ahead. Dee, get me something to dig with, anything you can find. [CREAKING] [GRUNTING] [CRASH] [CREAKING] [GASP] Oh! Oh! Dad! Dad! What? What, Dee? [WHIMPERING] [PANTING] Oh, my God. Take it slow. Take it slow. Easy. [GRUNTING] Easy does it. You got him, Dee? you got those legs? Easy does it. We don't know what's broken. [QUIET GRUNTING] Breathe. Max, get something from under his head. [BLOWING] Damn, look, we've got to get him warm. Uh, loosen his clothes, his shoes, his socks. Get them off now! [BLOWING] Good. Good. Rub his hands. Get his hands. Get the circulation going. Come on. Come on! OK, all right, breathe. [GASPING BREATH] [SCREAM] Ah Ah. [GASPING] He's breathing on his own. Get some blankets. We'll get him warm and get the blood circulating. It's about all we can do until he comes around. Max? [ROUGH BREATHING] You think you'll be all right staying with him? [GASPING BREATHS] All right, good. Anything change, the slightest thing, you call me. What's happening, Dad? We're passed the roofline. Are we through? We're getting there. [PANTING] It's breaking up. We'll get through if we keep working. It's looking good. That's great. There's a tree there, Dad. We'll get around that in a second. Yeah, right. Come on, Dee. Help me out here. Clear some of this snow away. [GRUNT] We're making progress. [GRUNT] Ah! [LABORED BREATHING] [INDISTINCT GRUNT] [GASPING GROAN] [LABORED BREATHING] [GRUNTING] Dad! What are you doing up here, Max? Look what I found. What is it? It's a Purple Heart. The guy's a war hero, right? Max, please, put this back where you found it. It's none of our business. And stay with him like I asked you to. OK. I'm going. [GRUNTING] Dee, get me some rope and something to haul this snow out of here. We'll get a better system going, OK? OK. [GRUNTING] [CREAKING] [SCREAMING] It's OK. It's OK. [CRYING] Dee, we can't afford to panic here. We've got to stay positive. What, so we can pretend that we're not buried alive in this place? God. Oh, God, look at us. Dee, I don't know if there's a foot of snow between us and the outside or 100 feet. I don't know. But I got to believe we're getting out of here. And, you got to believe it. I need you to pull together. I need you to be strong-- for Max and for me. [WHISPERING] OK. OK. I'm sorry, Dad. [CREAKING] I guess you can kiss your damage deposit goodbye now, huh? [LAUGHS] I thought that we could, uh, tie a rope to the handle, and we could haul the snow out that way. Good. Good. This is gonna work. [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] [GROANING] [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] [GROANING] [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] [LOUD GASPING] Dad! He's up! Thanks, Max. Look, it's OK. It's OK. You're all right. Help me. Dee, get more blankets. Max-- Max, get some of my clothes. Go. Go. Go. - Where am I? Where am I? It's OK. Where am I? My house. You're fine. You're lucky to be alive. Dad. Here give me those. [GRUNTING] Here let me help you with that. No, it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Where are my clothes? Your clothes are drying. I, uh-- I had a pack. Did you-- did you find a pack? Sorry, no. All we found was you. You were wearing a parachute. Max, he needs to rest. No, that's OK. He's OK. You remember anything? I was, uh-- I-I was flying to Denali, and, uh, the starboard engine went out, and, uh, the hydraulics went so I just--- I bailed out. I bailed out. - Anybody with you? - No. No. Thank God. No. No. No. Dee, see if you can find him something to eat, anything. I got you some dry clothes. Thanks. Thanks, son. Thanks. Here, chocolate. Thank you. Well, I-- I guess I owe you all a pretty big thank you. My name's Duncan, Duncan Snyder. Brian Kemp. Deidre. Max. Hi. What-- what happened? We were hit by an avalanche, we found you buried right outside that window. Anybody know we're trapped down here? No. Radio's dead. We're digging our way out from upstairs. Oh, that's smart. That's, uh-- that's very smart. I tell you what, I-- I, uh-- I'll get these clothes on, huh? And then-- then maybe I can help. I could sure use an extra pair of hands. OK. Oh! - Oh. - [GRUNTING] Watch it. Easy. [GRUNTING] Oh, this leg. This leg's not right. [PANTING] Yeah, it's probably just a torn ligament. You got something that I-- I could use to make a splint? I could-- I could get something for your leg. [RUMBLING] [SCREAMING] - No. It's OK. You guys go ahead. [CHUCKLING] It's a a hell of a lot more important getting us out of her than babysitting me. We better get going. OK. Brian, Deidre, Max, I really appreciate what you did. [CREAKING] Thank you. It's fine. Glad we could help you. [PANTING] [GRUNTING] OK. OK. We've got a system going. I'm gonna need some shoring! Dee, go downstairs. See what you can find, pieces of wood, anything. Yeah. Um, you got two jobs now, slacker. Pick up the pace, huh? Yes, sir. [GRUNTING] Hi. Hey. [PANTING] [CLOTH TEARING] [GRUNTING] People call you Deidre or Dee? Um, either. It doesn't really matter. Where you from? Well, I was born in Berkeley, but I live in Houston. Houston? No kidding. That's where Jane's from. That's my wife. I knew her during basic training. She was going to school at Rice down there. Uh, dammit. Um, here, I'll help you with that. Yeah, thanks. Here. Loop that around there. I made a couple of holes there. OK. Maybe you know the family. Her maiden name was Hatcher. They lived at Bel-Air Heights. You know that area? Alameda Street? No, I-- I don't think so. Real nice people in Houston, real nice. Oh! I'm sorry. No, it's OK. If I'm gonna be of any use, it's got to support my whole weight. Just go ahead. Give it a good yank. Go ahead. Go ahead. Aw! Aw. [PANTING] You know, I think I saw my plane go down. It hit the mountain. Probably started this whole mess. [PANTING] Here, we'll give this a try. Yeah, thanks. Oh. That's good. That's real good. [CRUMBLING AND CRASHING] MAX: Dee, get up here! Come on. Are you OK? Yeah. It'll take two hours before I can clear this snow. I needed something to shore these wall, Dee. Where were you? She-- she was helping me, Brian. You all right? I'm really sorry, Dad. It's my fault. You should take a break, huh? I can take over now. Yeah, Dad, you rest. Here. [GRUNTING] It's good, Brian. It's real good. Yeah, straight out through the roof, huh? Yeah, makes a certain amount of sense. Stands to reason. Top of the house is closest to the surface. Yeah. Yeah. You are right about that. [GRUNTING] Do you know, Brian, this roof is holding, well, we don't know how many tons of snow. I mean, it could go at any moment. [CREAKING] Well, when it goes, I mean, so does the tunnel. Now, on the other hand, the structure on the leeward side of the house is sound. I mean, you saw it yourself, Brian. It survived the impact. Now, if it were me, I'd dig right out the living room window where I came in. It's protected. [CREAKING] I'd dig away and up. [CREAKING] I know you spent a lot of time and effort on this root. But, uh, I got to tell you, I just think it's a hell of a lot riskier for you and your family. Yeah, but we were making good progress. Well, I'm just expressing my opinion. [CHUCKLING] And there are many roads to Mecca. We're already passed the roof here. We start downstairs, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Yep, that is [CREAKING] [CREAKING] Maybe Duncan's got a point. I don't want to take any chances with you kids. [CREAKING] We'll dig downstairs. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] OK, coming out. Oh. [GRUNTING] Deirdre, you've got to clear that snow away a little faster, huh? Sometimes I gotta stop shoveling and wait for you guys. Yes, sir. You're the boss. You all right? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. I'll take over now. Why? I'm doing fine. You want to rest that leg. Yeah, yeah, you're probably right. Thanks. Max. I can dig. I haven't even had a turn. I can clear the snow from behind you. No. You're not to go in this tunnel. But I can dig, Dad. I'm not useless. Why do you treat me like such a baby? Max, he's just concerned for you. That's his duty. The man's just trying to take care of his family. Max, it's not safe. Just clear snow like you've been doing. Come on. I got a five-year-old boy in Juno. He's probably getting dressed to go to school right now. And his mother is probably worried sick not hearing from me. Go to school? I'm supposed to graduate in a couple of months, but-- That's great. I never made it past 10th grade. Got a boyfriend in Houston? [CREAKING] [LAUGHING] Not really. [CHUCKLING] Not really but sort of? It's not serious. Oh. OK. So what you guys doing up here, on holiday? [CREAKING] Actually we came up for-- for spring break. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Ooh, some break. [LAUGHS] So, um, where's your mom? I guess she couldn't make it, huh? You know, you sure ask a lot of questions. [LAUGHS] DUNCAN: Sorry. Actually, my parents don't live together anymore. Oh. Well, sometimes that's for the best. Yeah, sometimes. What you gonna do when you finish school? I don't know. I-- I've been accepted to Stanford, English Literature. That's great. Yeah, actually, I-- I was thinking about taking a year off, just travel, you know? I really want to see Central America. And I was thinking about going to Rio for the-- for the Sun Festival. [LAUGHING] Now, that would be great. I haven't told my parents. [CREAKING] How come? My mom would freak. [LAUGHS] She, uh, she doesn't want me go anywhere alone. I don't know what my dad would say. Well, Deirdre, you're a young woman now. And you're a free woman, and you just got to do what you gotta do, right? [CREAKING] Yeah. Yeah, right. DUNCAN: Can I call you Dee? Yeah, sure. Dee. [LAUGHS] [PANTING] Dad, come on. Let me do it. Max. I'm not tired. Just while you rest a bit. [PANTING] All right. All right. Hey, but slow and easy. OK. DAD: [GRUNTING] I'll clear for a while, Dad. Thanks. Well, it's time for me to get back to work. Just give Max a minute. He wants to help. [CREAKING] Oh, OK. You know, Brian, you got great kids. I mean, that's what it's all about, isn't it? Yeah. That's what it's all about. MAX: Hey! I found something! What is it, Max? What did you find? It's a compass, a good one. Yes! Good work. What's so important about a compass? Hansel and Gretel, Brian. You know, like the crumbs. Follow my stuff all the way home. MAX: Hey, I've got something else! [RUMBLING] What is it? What is it, Max? MAX: It's stuck. I got it! [RUMBLING] Max? Max! Max! [RUMBLING] Son, grab my legs, pull! Pull! Come on! [GRUNTING] I got you. You're moving. I got you. All right. All right. All right. Yeah. Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe easy. Just breathe easy. Breathe slow. What'd you find in there, Max? Please, let him be. [PANTING] Sorry. OK. You're OK. You'll be fine. I saw a gun. Hey, looks like we're on the right track. I don't like firearms around my kids. Oh, it's-- it's part of my survival kit. A man needs a gun in Bush. We're not in the bush. Actually, it does make me a little nervous too. No firearms in this house. MAX: [PANTING] I'm sorry, Brian. I didn't mean to scare the kids. Put it away. This is where it goes. And this is where it stays. [CREAKING] Good Back to work. Oh, we're gonna have to shore this up. It could come down again. [GRUNTING] You OK? Max, I don't want you digging in that tunnel again. Dad, everybody's got to do it. No. You understand me? OK, Dad. [CREAKING] [CREAKING] Are you OK? I'm all right. Are you sure? I don't trust him. Dee, I'm just not sure the three of us alone can dig our way out of here. Dad, whatever you want to do, I will back you all the way. [GRUNTING] Hey, Max? Hand me that cup of water, will you? [CREAKING] Sure. [PANTING] Thanks. Look what I found. [PANTING] Where'd you find that? I found it in your pants. Sorry I took it. That's OK. You were just hanging onto it for me. Where'd you get it? Took a bullet in Somalia, a Delta Force thing. Wow. Wanna do me a favor? Will you show we where you found that gun and compass? Uh, my father told me not to go in there. Oh, he's absolutely right. But I'm not asking you to dig here. I just want you to show me where you found my stuff. I-- I can't. [CREAKING] You know, Max, if I listened to everything my commanding officer said, I would never have been awarded this Purple Heart. I want you to have it. - Really? For luck. Cool. [PANTING] DUNCAN: [GRUNTING] [PANTING] Max? Max! Max, get out of there. Get out of there now! I thought I told you that I didn't want you in that tunnel. I'm sorry. Did he tell you to go in there? Did Duncan tell you to go in there? Duncan? Duncan! DUNCAN: [GRUNTING] Duncan, you stay the hell away from my boy. (ANGRILY) You hear me? [PANTING AND GRUNTING] What are you doing? You're digging down! What the hell are you doing? Ah! Ah! You're done. What's the matter with you, Brian? I'm just digging! [SOUNDS OF FIGHTING] Now, knock it off, man! I don't wanna hurt you. Oh! [SOUNDS OF FIGHTING] Enough! Please, let him go. [PANTING] Dee, don't you point that thing at me. It's dangerous. Now, put it down. Please. Please. OK. OK. We're coming out. Brian? Come on. DAD: Yeah. Let's go. [GRUNTING] OK, give me the gun, Dee. Everything's OK. I just lost my temper. Dad grabbed my bad leg. Oh, please don't come any closer. Dee, now, come on. Somebody could get hurt with that thing. Now, we don't want that to happen now, do we, huh? Do we? Now, come on. Just give me the gun. No, I can't. Oh, please. Dee-- [SOBBING] God. Bastard! That bastard was digging down. Max, get the broom. DUNCAN: Dee. Dee! Dee-- DUNCAN: Dee! Dee, clear the snow away like you did before. Ah! Come on, you guys, let me go! Please? Dee, oh, please. Don't leave me here to die. Don't pay attention to him. We're not gonna let him die. We're gonna dig our way out of here. DUNCAN: Dee--e--e! Maybe you don't get this, but you need me. Don't you, huh? I think you do. Nothing against you kids up there, but you're gonna need my muscle to get out of here! Come on, Brian, admit it. You need me to help dig! No. [GRUNTING] We're doing great. I'm thinking maybe four or five feet an hour. Dad, come on, let me take over. You're exhausted. I'm OK. Look, just get me some water, OK? [PANTING] Sure. Thanks. [GRUNTING] Dee. Dee! You look at me. Dee, you know me. You think I deserve this? Please, just-- just do me a favor. Just loosen the ropes a little bit. I've got no feelings in my hands. Please. Please? Well, it was worth a shot anyway, huh? Dee, I'm really sorry. I guess I just got a temper, huh? But you know your dad, he hurt me really bad, you know? Still, you're right. I should've never let it get to me. I guess I really blew it, huh? [CREAKING] Dee. Dee. Dee! Could I have a little of that? Please? I'm so thirsty. Please. Please. [PANTING] Just pour it down my throat. Go ahead. Mm. Mm. [GULPING] Thank you. Thank you very much. [GRUNTING] We're through. We've broken through! Max ? Max? Dee? We've reached the surface. Where's your sister? Dee? Dee? Dee? Dee? [MUFFLED SHOUTING] Look out! Ah! [SCREAMING] You started, Brian. [MUFFLED SHOUTING] How the hell am I supposed to trust you now? Untie my daughter. [MUFFLED SHOUTING] Dad! Hey, Max, come on down. Sit down. I'm asking you, please untie my daughter. [MUFFLED CRIES] Are you asking me for a favor? What, do you think I owe you a favor? Please. [CREAKING] Oh. All right, Brian, whatever you say. OK, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna dig in my tunnel, as we agreed. They're almost through. We hit the surface. Great. But first we gotta get my stuff. What's in there's you want so badly? A prize, Brian, a prize. [BANG] [SCREAM] We better get started! Come on. We're a family now. Let's work as a team. Come on. Come on. Are you are right? Please don't make him dig. He's hurt. I'm fine. Dad, you OK? Sure. I'm doing all right. Dad? Is Duncan gonna kill us? No, Max, no. He just wants his things. That's all. Then he'll let us go. Yeah. You're mad at me, aren't you? Look, you don't understand it-- it's is that your dad's got a bad temper. That's all. Why are you doing this to us? I mean, what is that you want so bad? See, you are mad at me. Why are you taking this thing so personally? It's got nothing to do with you and me. Dee, you're a good person, like me. And you're sensitive, like me. I mean, I like you. I know I got caught up in a little lie back there. I mean, I don't have a wife and kids. [CHUCKLING] I just told you about them because-- because I wanted you to like me. [GASPING] It's OK. It's OK. I'd never hurt you. No, never. I just want you to like me. Get your hands off my daughter. We were just talking. Get away from her. Nothing happened here, Brian. Tell him, Dee. Tell him nothing happened. It's OK, Dad. Never again. You hear me? Yes, sir. You're the boss. [CREAKING] [SHOUTING] Go on, dig! [PANTING] [GRUNTING] We need to find a way to distract. Take it easy, Dad. Stupid! I promise you he's not going to hurt you. Hey. Here. You can have your stupid medal back. What's the matter? I thought we were pals. We're not pals. I hate your guts. Max, I'm sorry about Dad. He's just got to learn to show some respect, right? This is not my medal. It belonged to my dad. He lost half his face in Korea for this medal. But he knew respect. He knew discipline. He knew commitment. (LOUDLY You hit first! [CHUCKLES] (QUIETLY) And ask questions later. Yeah, that's my dad, Max, a real hero. [TAPPING METAL] [RATTLING] Brian? What the hell's going on? What the hell's going on, Brian? I don't hear anything. Hang On. Brian? We found something. DUNCAN: What? What? What? What? What'd you find? I'm-- I-- I-- I-- can't tell. Looks like a camera. Camera. OK, just get it down here. Trying to get it. It's-- it's stuck, wedged under a rock. Just get out of there. Come on! Just get out of there right now. Come on! Come on! I can't shift it. I-- I can't seem to shift it with this shoulder of mine. Get out of there. Come on. Can't take this shoulder. I tried. [PANTING] Go upstairs. Now. What's going on? Come on. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Dad, are we gonna leave him? Forget him. Help me out here, where's the pick? Where is it? It's in the tunnel. It's frozen over. But it shouldn't take much longer. Get your brother and get warm clothes, sweaters, boots, coats. Go ahead. [GRUNTING] Come on, Max. Get your warm coat. Come on. Let's go. Dad! Dad! He's getting out! Dad, he's getting out. Get in the tunnel, both of you. Dee! [GRUNTING] Brian! Where are my diamonds? That a-girl. [GRUNTING] [PANTING] Ah! No! [GRUNTING] What happened? I'm sorry. I slipped. It's OK. Go. Go. Go. Go. Brian! Ah! [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] Brian! All right, everybody come on back down to Duncan, nice and easy. Move it! Max, you gotta get out of here by yourself. I can't. Yes, you can. Brian, I'm gonna count to three. Don't listen to him. DUNCAN: 1-- Listen to me, go down the road and get help DUNCAN: 2-- [GUN CLICKS] - We're coming. [WHISPERING] Down the mountain and get help! Ah, we got a lot of work to do, start all over. Go, Max, go! Max! Max! [GRUNTING] Ah! [SCREAM] [CRASHING] [GASPING] [GROANING] [CREAKING] [SCREAMING] Do it! Do it! Kill him! [SHOUTING] Do it! Do it! Kill him! [CRYING] [WHIMPERING] [CRYING] [PANTING] Is he gonna bleed to death? Get me some tape. [PANTING] [CREAKING] Oh, my god! The second floor is gone! [CREAKING] Oh, god! Dee, please, you gotta hang in here. We were close. We'll get there again. Don't touch me! I'm gonna go home now! Dee! Dee! No don't! [SOBBING] I don't know where I am! I don't-- don't know if it's day. I don't know if it's night. I don't know what's happened to Max. Dee, I promise we'll get out of here. I promise. Don't make promises to me! You can't do it anymore, Dad. You just can't. [WIND BLOWING] Mister! Over here! Hey, mister, over here! Mister! I need your help. There's a man, and he took my family. They're caught. They're caught in-- [WIND WHISTLING] It's funny. On the way up I was thinking about Aunt Kathy's wedding, how you weren't supposed to come and there was this big to do because you and Mom were split up, and you weren't supposed to be seen together in the same place at the same time. I remember thinking, hey, that is so great when you showed up there with all those balloons. [CREAKING] And everyone was so uptight. [CREAKING] But Mom, she thought it was really funny. [LAUGHING] And you know, I watched you guys dancing, just like you were back together again and everything was normal. And then you just got up and you left early. [CREAKING] [CRYING] I mean, it just-- it looked so right. Why couldn't you guys have worked it out? Hello? Hello? [ECHOING] Can anybody hear me? [ECHOING] Can anybody hear me? Hello? Hello? [ECHOING] [GRUNTING] Is there an excuse for your mom and I not working harder, an excuse for leaving you kids, for all this time lost, not being there while you're-- while you're growing up? There's no excuse, never will be. There's nothing I can do to change what's happened. We're gonna get through this stuff. We can't be far from the surface. We know where we have to go. Give me a hand, Dee. [GASPING] [WHISPERING] Dad. [LOUDLY] Dad! [LAUGHING] Oh! Dee. Dee. DEE: Oh, god! [CRYING AND LAUGHING] [CREAKING] [CROWS CAWING] Hello? Can anybody hear me? [GROWLING AND BARKING] [PANTING] [CROW CAWING] MAN: [WHISTLES] [DOG WHINING] [PANTING] Are you sure you're up to this? No. You can't get make it with that shoulder. OK, one step at a time. Test each foot hold with your weight before you go on, OK? Yeah. When you get to the job, just tie it up. Didn't I tell you we'd get out? Yeah, yeah, you did. OK. OK. [GRUNTING] That a-girl. [PANTING] DAD: I'll keep feeding this rope up there. There's not much to grab on to. You're doing fine. Don't look down here. Just keep looking up, keep going. [BARKING] How about this, now, does this look familiar? Do you remember a landmark, a road, a rock face, anything? It was a cabin. My father rented it for the season. It's up here somewhere. I know it is! I'll recognize it. This cabin, it's buried 30 feet under the snow? It's a big mountain, son. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] Come on, Dee. Come on. Let me do this. No, it's OK. I'm going up. [GRUNTING] I made it! No! Hi. It's me. Come on down, one step at a time, OK? OK. No! God! Come on. Whoa. Come on! Ah! What did you do to him? Oh, Dad! Dee. Are you all right? You've got to help me talk some sense into Dad. He won't tell me where my diamonds are. I don't know what you're talking about. Ah! [SCREAMING] Dee, would you do me a favor? Would you bring me some chocolates? [CREAKING] Do what he says. [GRUNTING] You know, Brian? She is a great kid. I like her a lot. Ah! Ah. You know, Brian? Dee was telling me about a dream. Did you know that she wants to travel? She doesn't want to be cooped up in some university like her old man. [GASPING] [CREAKING] Your daughter has such a feeling for life. [CREAKING] I hope you appreciate that, Brian. Duncan, here. Oh, good. Now let her go. [PANTING] Sure. Ah! [SCREAMING] Why didn't you kill me? Come on, Dee. It's you and me now, Dee. We can work together. [CRYING] [GRUNTING] OK. OK. Now, pick them up. [CREAKING] I found one, Dee. [CRASHING] [SCREAMING] I'm gonna take you back down the mountain. We'll get some help. You get in now. [WIND WHISTLING] Hey! Get back here! I got four, Dee. How many you got? [CREAKING] I got one. One? I'm winning. Make sure you don't go over the same spot twice, huh? Just remember that. Ooh, look at this, teardrop, 9 and 1/2 karats. Oh, must be worth a lot. You have no idea. Here, go on, Dee, take one, for yourself, from me, Oh. Uh, uh, yeah. Thank you, Duncan. [CREAKING] Oh, good choice. That's a marquise. Duncan? Can I-- can I get something to put underneath my dad's head because he looks like he's a little-- [CRASHING] --uncomfortable! Yeah, he does. Go ahead. [RUMBLING] [CREAKING] [GROANING] Watch your head. [CREAKING] The Jeep-- [RUMBLING] --before the whole place goes. DUNCAN: [CHUCKLING] Hey, Dee, got two more, beauties.
