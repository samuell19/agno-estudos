(fanfare music) (eerie music) (lounge music) (rattling) (telephone rings) - [Voiceover] Yes? - Yes? Dorin speaking. No. Well, it's impossible, sir. It's impossible. I finished my last case. Mm-mm. I'm going on vacation. So long. Add it to my bill, dear. - Okay, the chief wants to see you, mister. Come on. - Wish me luck, baby. Looks like I've had it. - [Tall Man] Inspector Dorin? - Yes? - [Tall Man] We came out on the pilot ship. They're expecting you at headquarters. - Okay. (honks) Judging from what my chief told me on the phone, I gathered that your men haven't learned much, that there's no lead for you to follow. - Mr. Dorin, it's even worse than that. Until now we kept the whole situation very quiet, but another death and I'm worried that the press might be down on us. - [Dorin] Murder, Chief? - It would seem. We don't know. - [Dorin] Don't know? - The whole thing sounds completely riddiculous. We haven't a single piece of evidence that there was foul play. All we know is that six unrelated deaths have recently occurred and all within a short distance of a famous grotto near here and within the last six months. - Chief, are you asking me to find the killer or to establish that a murder has been committed? - I want you to find out exactly what's happened before a full-scale panic hits us. - Assuming there has been a murder, have you been able to discover any traces-- - They were all the same. No motive, not even a suspect, just six women dead. - Ah. All women? - Yes, women. And all between the ages of 18 and 22. - [Dorin] Interesting. Anything to suggest that they might be sex murders? - [Chief] No, the medical report shows that none of the girls was molested. I know what you're thinking, but I wouldn't have called you in if my men had anything substantial to go on. You're my one hope. That's why I have asked you to come here. - Mm, okay. I'll give it a try. I can't guarantee anything, naturally. - Of course not. - I'll do what I can. - The deaths all occurred in a village around 60 miles north of here. A private car will be placed at your disposal. You will find a good road map in the car, and there's a device for seeing in dark also in the car. It's an infrared viewer. You'll need it for the grottoes. And here, you may need these papers I prepared for the local police, if you need them at all. - I hope not. I'd rather work on my own. I'll go as a tourist on a trip to the grotto. Well, Chief, since that's all the information you can give me, I better get on my way. I'll report in to you just as soon as I've had a good look around. - Oh, and one more thing. I don't whether it's relative, but it's interesting. It would appear that during the last six months there's been a great many cuts in power. Each time that one of the girls died there's been no current for about one hour. - In other words, whenever a death took place there's been a blackout there. - [Chief] Yes. - [Dorin] Well, did you check all the power? - Yes, naturally. The engineer looked all over them. The over landline was checked too. It's not been touched. And yet each time all the lights have failed just as if someone had pulled the switch. (jaunty pop music) (woman giggles) (man chuckles) - Well, here's to you. - Mm, may I take it to my room? Will you need me for anything? - Will you be needed or be wanted? (woman laughs) - You mustn't! - Why do you wanna go to sleep? It's such a waste. (woman laughs) What have you got there? - Oh! - Well, let's see. Uh-oh. - [Woman] Oh. (giggling) - [Man] I'm terribly sorry. Now I have broken it. I'll get it fixed. I didn't mean to do that, you know. - Yes, thank you. I think I'd better... go on up to bed. I should get to sleep. - Mm-hmm. Go on up. I was only fooling. I just wanted to be friendly. (woman chuckles) - Good night, sir. - [Man] Good night. And what am I left with? Just the wine. (muffled music) (yawns) - [Woman] Mm. (wind whistling and bell tolling) (wimpers) (wind whistling) (jaunty pop music) (wind and dogs howling) (ominous music) - [Woman] Having trouble? - Yes. Good evening. - [Woman] Could I help you? - I don't believe so. There is something wrong with the electrical system of this car, I'm afraid. (dogs whining and howling) Don't those dogs ever shut up? - Oh, they'll stop soon. What are you going to do now? - It's delightful to know that someone cares. - [Woman] You could hardly spend the night out here. - I hope to find a room in the village. - If it will be any help to you, I'll send someone to look at the car in the morning. - That would certainly be kind. Even my flashlight won't work. (woman laughs) - We're used to power failures. - It looks like I'll be staying around this place, so let me introduce myself, Frank Dorin. - I'm Karin Schumann. I'm working as secretary to the professor up at the castle. - And you wait here every night to help cars that break down? - Well, not precisely. I was out on my evening walk. You mustn't worry about the car here. There isn't much traffic on this old road. (dogs howling) - And when will I see you again? - Do you intend to stay on here? - You could talk me into it. - You should've gotten here three weeks ago. - Why is that? - Oh, I'm just about finished with my work for the professor. - Oh, what a shame. Anyway, I'd like a chance to thank you. - No need to thank me. You'll find an inn not far from here. They'll have a room. Go right straight down the road. Good night, Mr. Dorin. - Once more, thanks a lot and when do I see you again? - Tomorrow. I'm curious to see if our local hotel satisfies you. Good night. - Good night. (eerie music) (tick-tocking) (sighs) (eerie music) (creaking) (dogs howling) (wind whistling) (knocking) - Yeah? (knocking) Oh, good evening, sir. Good evening. Can I help you? - Good evening. Have you got a room? - A room, sir? These days you can take your pick of them. There's nobody comes here anymore, at least not since the murders began. The... - Maybe I could come inside before you tell me all the local scandal. (innkeeper laughing) - Sorry, sorry, but nobody stays, not one guest. - [Dorin] Thank you. - [Innkeepper] Come in. - [Dorin] No lights? - All these darn power cuts. Every other five minutes they're out. Is that your only bag? - No, no, the rest is still in my car on the edge of town. Can't seem to start it. - Ah. Have you had something to eat yet? - No, not yet. - The maid's gone to bed, but what would you say to a nice cold chicken I got? And a wonderful old wine, huh? It's a soul warmer. - (chuckles) You bet. My soul's freezing. (owl hooting) (loud creaking) (owl screeches) (gasps) - At last. I'd been worrying all the time. Where have you been, Miss Karin? - [Karin] Oh, that's sweet of you. That's very thoughtful, but what if the professor needed you? - I thought of that. That's why I didn't go to the village. Just in case the professor called. - But you really mustn't worry so. - Huh? Oh, the lights went out all over, all the hounds yellin', the moon hid behind the clouds, the wind blew in the trees, "Woo!" It's not good for you to be out alone. And our ghost too! (giggling) Don't laugh, Miss Karin. Don't laugh about ghosts. - Oh, what an imagination. It's most likely this gloomy house. And where's the professor? - I don't know. Just before midnight the professor said, "John, you can go to bed now." - And instead you've been waiting here for me. - I'll take care of you, Miss Karin. It's not good for you to be alone here. This house is evil. (jaunty jazz music) - Well, at last. Won't be needing this anymore. Uh, how long do you think you'll be staying? - Quite a while, if that was a sample of the meals. - Usually they're better when I've had some advance notice. You can stay here for as long as you want. Are you here on business then? - Pleasure. - Well, if you're looking for a good time, I can think of lots better places to go for it. - Well, that doesn't sound very business like. - This village used to be under some kind of curse. In the last six months we've had six young women die mysteriously. - And what do the police say about it? (scoffs) - Police. What do they know? They're a lot of fools. They think we're all crazy. You might not know that in the grottoes-- - What's in the grottoes? - You just keep away. They are very dangerous. What if vampires lived in the grottoes? - Vampires? (laughs) That's only superstition. - Not superstition, sir. These are dead who rise at midnight and who come out of their graves and roam in search of human blood to drink. - All right, my friend, all right. Tell me all about it in the morning. - Uh-huh. I'd better keep my mouth shut, because nobody believes it or even cares. - I think I'll go to bed now. I'm very tired. - Ah, well, then I'll just wish you pleasant dreams. - Mm-hmm. - Our maid and you are neighbors and she gets up very early, you know. I hope that you won't be disturbed. - I doubt it, because I'm so sleepy it won't matter in the least. - If you're bound and determined to visit the grottoes then I think you'd better go and visit old Nanny. - Good night. - Good night. (knocking) (knocking) (groaning) - What's all the racket? Let me sleep, will ya? - [Voiceover] Open up! Police! (knocking) (knocking) Open up or we'll break it down! - Okay, okay. I'm comin'. (banging) I wouldn't do that. All right, my friend, get back there. - Better give me that pistol or you're going to land in jail, mister. - Don't be so sure. You better be ready to explain your steamroller technique or you'll be the one to land in jail. - Inspector? - Nice to know you can read. - We're sorry, sir. - Yeah, we're sorry. - We didn't know, you see? - All right, I want an explanation, quick. - The house maid, Maria, she's been found dead. And she was in the room next to yours. - Murdered? - We aren't sure, sir, but-- - You aren't sure and you go breaking into rooms like this? Are you a couple of comedians or what? A couple of amateur night cops? - Well, you see these unsolved deaths or murders or... whatever you want to call them are driving us nuts. - Well, suppose it was murder and I'm the murderer. You think that I'd climb back into bed in my room next to her? - We didn't stop to think I guess. - Then wouldn't you say it's time you started? - Yeah. - Well, now I wanna see the body. - Right this way, inspector. - That makes it number seven, doesn't it? I would say a routine case. - And those? - [Bespectacled Man] Superficial scratches. What's it to you? Are you a policeman? - He's a detective, Doctor. - Hmm. Bet you were sent here to see about these murder investigations. You're just wasting your time around here. There were no murders, you hear? No murders at all. I have already officially stated the cause of death as heart failure in each case. - Mm. - That's my diagnosis. I'm not going to change it. - It wasn't heart failure, Doctor, and you know it. We all know it, but you're afraid to say what you know to be true. It was the vampires, I tell you, that killed Maria last night. They want to punish me because last night I took this cross away from her. - Get rid of that silly old woman. "Vampires." - Uh-huh. - We're supposed to be living in the 20th century. - [Dorin] Sergeant, I shall wanna talk to him later. - Right, sir. - Look, your presence here, Inspector, doesn't concern me. I hope, though, that you'll try and quiet some of this talk about murders and vampires. - You could've done it long ago yourself, you know. - [Doctor] What does that mean? - It means when you made out your death certificates you stated such vague causes. That's what started the rumors. - What should I have put down, "Death by vampire bite"? - The fact you couldn't be sure and that the cause of death was unknown and then you perform an autopsy. You must know what that is, Doctor. (tense music) He's a strange man. Always been like that? - What do you mean, Inspector? - A man must ask questions, especially when he's a doctor. All this vampire talk. I'll have to prove they don't exist. - Don't, sir. Please don't. It's too dangerous. You're not ready yet to have a meeting like this with... such things, with vampires. It means certain death for us humans, unless... - Unless what? - You had better go see Nanny. (birds chirping) (knocking) - [Voiceover] It's open! - You who come here from the police, welcome. - Hello, Nanny. I'm here from the-- - I know. Come here. Listen. Yes. You're the one. I bid you welcome. You come from afar, over the great waters. You live at home in a great tower. It is good you are fearless, but still you trust in the power of God, and if your heart doesn't turn to stone, you will conquer the powers of darkness which threaten you. (tense music) (fire crackling) This is your lifeline as it is at this moment. See where it fades and gets thinner? Understand this: it means much danger for you. They know that you plan their defeat now. If you do not head me, you will find your life quickly wiped out like this soot. Each night at midnight they leave the grottoes, gliding over their graves to visit sleeping ones in their beds. - I have seven deaths which are to be solved. - Have you? You won't bring one of them back to life again. These women have lost their mortal souls. - Those are the church's concern, aren't they, Nanny? These murders must come to a stop. The guilty one must answer to justice for them. - He will answer, Judgement Day he will. - I can't wait that long. I must solve this case. - [Nanny] What a pity to lose your life. - If it's true, this murderer is aware of what I plan and why I've been sent to this place, and still greets me with the death of another woman sleeping in the room next to mine then I-- - No, no, no. No, you mustn't look at it like that. No, it didn't happen that way. Maria was doomed to such a fate, and even if you'd not been sleeping in the room next to hers. - Maybe, but who are they, where are they, those who murdered that girl? I've got to find them! - Shh. They are in the grottoes, where they were forced over 200 years ago by a curse. They come forth at 12 o'clock for one hour minus one minute, come out in quest of the blood of young women which they drink, thus making their bloodless shells into new vampires for eternity. - I can't arrest vampires. - No, you cannot arrest them, though you can save their souls if you have faith. - What must I do, Nanny? How can I recognize them? - But you can't recognize them. They are like me and you. When they show themselves, when you see a vampire truly there's no escape left for you. The fangs of the vampire are already thirsty for blood then. There's no means by which you may escape. You'll be lost. Unless... - [Dorin] Unless what? - Bend your head. You must wear this. It will be useful to protect your body. Beware though. It will not protect your soul from the spirit's evil enticements. They will try all their wiles to get you to remove this cross which I've placed about your neck. They live in the loveliest of bodies. Look, watch how enticingly they dance. (eerie music) You must hide the cross. This was ground from the thorns of mountain roses, which on Walpurgis Night are in full bloom, the night when the witches' fires burn on the mountains. This is the weapon against them, against the dark powers. When you find a new victim of the vampires, at once sprinkle this powder on the freshly made wound and... the wound will vanish, vanish completely, and the maiden is restored to life. - Well, where's your jug? - No, no, I didn't come here for wine. Where's the inspector? - Inspector? What do you want with him? (birds chirping) (solemn accordion music) (chickens clucking) (lively accordion music) (dog barking) (solemn accordion music) (whistling) - Oh, forgive me. I'm sorry, sir. Inspector Dorin, am I right? - You are. - I bring greetings to you from Professor von Adelsberg. The professor would like Mr. Dorin, please, to come stay with us at the castle. - Oh. I find the accommodations here are very good, though it seems I won't get much sleep. Give my respects to the professor and say I'll be delighted to accept. - That's fine. - Oh, and just a moment. Is the professor the employer of Miss Schumann? - The employer? Oh, yes, that's right, sir. - Stefan? Where are you? - He's down in the cellar. - [Dorin] Huh. - Oh, by the way, my diagnosis was correct. It was heart failures in the case of the other victims. - Mm-hmm. - I have said they might prepare the body in her room. - Well, it's none of my business. I will be at the castle. The professor asked me to stay there. - Uh-huh. He's a peculiar man. The professor isn't usually that hospitable. - Tell me, Doctor, who is this professor? What kind of a man is he? What's he doing here? - We don't know. He came here six months ago accompanied by a servant who's colored. He began by saying he owned the castle, which all these years had stood deserted on the mountain, took possession when his claim was on it officially... - And then? - Nothing. They gossip so much in the village, particularly about foreigners, and when the other one is black, they've great material. - Then we've suddenly got a black vampire. - Right. When it's also something which these peasants can't understand, then they run to Nanny. Stupid superstitions for old women. Goodbye, Inspector. - Thanks, Doctor. (laughing) - [Stefan] Ah, if you will allow me to, Inspector, the best in the land, over 200 years old. - Looks just like blood. Get it from a vampire? - No, sir, no. You mustn't even think like that, and you certainly shouldn't say it. - Did the colored man mention I was asked by the professor to stay at the castle? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. He did, Inspector, yes, he did. You will certainly be a lot more comfortable and no dead woman in the next bedroom. And when your car is repaired you may as well leave it in my courtyard, because you know there's only a footpath leading up to the castle. - Yes, but first, I'd like to see the grotto. - You want to go in there alone? - No, no, not alone. My pistol will be along with me. - That won't help you if you see them. The dead can't be killed again. - Since you know so much, why don't you join me? - Me? All the saints protect. I am an old man and besides, I'd really rather die in my own bed. Who'd look after my inn if anything happened? Tell me that. - Yes, I suppose you're right. - But here's a real good lantern. I think you'd better take it with you. - Have you read this yet? Another death has taken place. Under the eyes of the police another woman has just been killed. - Are you planning to send an investigating team? - No. Give Dorin a chance anyway. He only started the case yesterday. - Oh, but the newspapers are sure to make a big story of this. - Hope for the best. In view of the situation, we'd better get in contact with Inspector Dorin immediately. He must make a blood test on the go. - Going to the grotto, Mr. Dorin? - Well, if this is the right way, yes. - Shall I come with you? - Not afraid? - No. If the inspector's not, why should I be frightened? - Here. - John! John, where are you? Who told John that he might leave the castle? He's in grave danger. - Oh, Professor, what-- - Go now. Leave me alone. (footsteps echoing) John! John, where are you? (ominous music) (footsteps echoing) - I just don't understand it. What are you looking for? - Well, I'm not so sure myself. - I don't see anything. Why are the men in village so scared of this old hole? It all looks okay. - You're right. They're all stupid. Old women gossip. (eerie music) (footsteps echoing) Wait a second. Am I crazy? Over there. I'm sure I saw a light blink. - Yes, yes. I saw a light too. Maybe there are ghosts in here. - Did you hear that, John? - Nuh-huh. What is it? - Nothing. There hasn't been anyone here for 100 years and I wouldn't mind running into one of those cute little vampire things, you know? - Oh! (crashes) - Thanks, John. That was close. (gasps) - Well, what's the matter with you? - I... (stammers) I'm waiting for the inspector. - Ah. - It's top secret. - Hmm. That's better. Don't laugh, John, but I had a feeling back there among those stalagmites that we were being watched. One night in that place and a man would go crazy. - I'm not laughing at all, Inspector. I feel just the same way. What was that? - This isn't a spot I care for. - Say, Inspector, do you think vampires like black blood? - I'm not sure, John, but I sure like your black skin. Come on. Here you are, one lamp and still intact and me too. - Oh, Inspector, I have a message for you. - Thanks. Do you know where one might find the good doctor at this hour? - You should find him at his home I think, sir. - Okay, then go tell him that I would like to see him as soon as soon as he can come. - Right away, Inspector. - [Burly Man] Hey, give me some wine! - Who is that man? - You don't need to be afraid that he'll hear you, sir. Thomas has been deaf since he was a child. He's the strongest man in the village, oh, but he's harmless enough. - Watch it! Look, that guy just better not touch our girls. - Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Yeah, well, you'd better tell 'im, huh? - Yes, yes. - Or else he'll answer to me. Do you understand? - Mm-hmm. (quiet murmuring) (eerie music) - [Professor] Who gave you permission to go into the grottoes? I've been looking all over for you. You were in the greatest of danger, stupid man that you are. As if there wasn't already enough talk here about us. Difficulty upon difficulty and on account of your foolishness! - Oh, sir, forgive me. I was wrong to go. - Did you invite the inspector as I instructed you? - Oh, yes, I have. I did it. Mr. Dorin thanks you and he'll come to the castle tonight. You can count on him coming. - Good. (knocking) - Yes? - What's the matter, Inspector? You sent for me I believe. - Yes. Read this while I finish packing. (ominous music) - Oh, that's simple. It's only a matter of opening a vein and taking some blood. But what do you and the police hope to find? Do you think it was poison? - I wouldn't know. There's gossip. You've heard the talk that's going around. - Don't tell me you believe that gossip. It was idiotic of you to go and see Nanny, you know. She's just an old witch. - Hmm, I thought you didn't believe in old witches. - Now that they've accepted you as another believer, you've added support to the rumors that vampires are about. The dead are dead. - Well, you must know. Come on, let's visit the dead girl. - Those idiots at the powerhouse, they can drink all right, but just try to get them to work. - [Stefan] Don't worry, I'm bringing a candle, Inspector. (wind whistling) - This just can't be true. (dogs howling) Well, what's your diagnosis this time, Doctor? - Peculiar. The murderer must have gotten wind of the fact that the police plan to make a blood test of the corpse. Embarrassing for you, Inspector. - Well, Doctor, it really interests me that you choose to use the word "murderer." Does that mean maybe you agree that these women met unnatural deaths? That's a new opinion, isn't it-- - Inspector-- - No discussion. I will say that you've changed your mind when I make my report out. Your new diagnosis will help. That's all. I think you can go now, Doctor. Good night. - Hmm. - [Dorin] Stefan? Please see to it that the good doctor doesn't break his neck on the stairs. He's my star witness. Good night. (knocking) Professor von Adelsberg? - Yes? - [Dorin] Frank Dorin. - Come in. - [Dorin] Thank you. (creaking) (thud echoing) - I'm pleased to meet you, my dear Mr. Dorin. Welcome to my humble home. Do please make it your home. My entire household is at your disposal. - Thank you for your kindness, Professor van Adelsberg. - My secretary will take you to your room. My servant has his evening off, you see. - [Karin] Good evening, Mr. Dorin. - Oh, I see we meet again. - Have you eaten yet? - Yes, I have. The innkeeper is a fabulous cook. I must thank you, professor... Oh, where did he go to? - We have no electric light in the castle. Come along, I'll show you your room now. - Thank you. (footsteps echoing) - Oh! Hmm, well, I admit, I didn't expect this. - What then? - Oh, a small dungeon and a water jug, a few rats. (laughing) - [Karin] It's strange, but somehow laughing seems wrong in these old rooms, doesn't it? (Dorin chuckles) - These old walls could really tell some tales. - I'd rather you told me about how your work's going. - Oh, it's going splendidly. To welcome me, they've killed a seventh. - Yes, Maria from the inn. Yes, we heard. Ghastly. - And this evening, her corpse disappeared. - Oh, but no, that can't be true. - I wouldn't know, but I'm sure that the good people in this town will come up with an explanation. Ghosts or vampires have stolen it away. - That's only natural for superstitious people. What do the police say? - We're giving no comment and it's my opinion the police will clear this whole situation up and without using a magician. - I'm so grateful that you could accept the professor's invitation to stay here. It's good to talk to someone. I mean that sometimes it's very lonely up here. - I'd hoped that you might sit, oh, but never mind. It seems that the professor takes all your time. - My time has gone into 1,300 articles about experiments with blood, blood corpuscles, blood groups, blood cells, anything and everything about blood. - Exhausting work. - Please, let's not talk about it. I must go now. Oh, the professor's expecting you downstairs. - Just a minute, Karin. - [Karin] Yes? - Ever wear jewelry? - Would you like to buy me some? - (chuckles) Well, not exactly, but I've always felt that a little jewelry can flatter a woman. Most of the women around here wear small crosses. - Most of the women around here believe in vampires, don't they, Mr. Dorin? Good night. (sighs) (humming) (wind and dogs howling) - Hmm. Can't break outta here. - Everything all right? (gasps) In this house we don't tolerate vanity. (glass shattering) I thought that I'd made that clear when you first got here. (ominous music) (rattling) (lively accordion music) - Good evening. - Huh? Good evening. - [John] Could I get a coffee? - [Stefan] Yes. - Get him out, will you? - Better come back again some other time. - But I'm free this evening. I, I invite you all to drink with me. (grunts) - [Thomas] You. (grunting) (wind whistling) - I'm very sorry, John. You mustn't pay any attention. - [John] Why shouldn't I? - [Stefan] That's right. - [Stefan] Because he's deaf. He's not all together responsible. He isn't exactly right in his mind. It's not his fault. (John grumbles) - You flatter me greatly, Inspector Dorin, by accepting my invitation. It was unthinkable to allow you to continue staying at that terrible hotel and especially with a body in the room next to yours. - The pleasure is mine. Thank you, Professor. I appreciate your concern, but I was spared the necessity of sleeping with a body in the room next to mine. - How's that? - The girl has disappeared. - What? Had the murderer stolen the body? - Your view is reminiscent of someone else's. It's the one the doctor had, namely, the murderer is trying to remove any clues. - Is there a better answer, Inspector? - Mm, not right now. - Please. To my illustrious guest. - [Dorin] Thank you. - When the weather's bad and you can't go out walking, my library is rather well stocked. Feel free to use it. You'll find that there are all manner of books here, surely there's some in your field. You see, my interest is legal medicine. Please treat the castle as your own. Two or three of the doors are locked. Will you please respect that? It's my laboratory. My experiments are not to the stage where I wish them publicized yet. You understand? - Of course I do. Though it seems ungrateful, I know, may I ask you why you have invited me here, Professor? - Oh, but naturally. (chuckles) Quite frankly, I was curious. You're the first actual detective I've ever met. (chuckles) - Then I must take care not to disappoint you in any way. I shall act like a detective all the time. - May I say I wish your first night with me brings you contentment and peace. - I know it will. I'm afraid that I'm keeping you from your work. - The lady's name was Babel. Yes, in my old age, I need much less sleep, you see. (wind whistling) (booms) (gasps) (shrieks) (wind whistling) (creaking) (eerie music) (shrieking) (knocking) (creaking) - Good morning. - Uh, good morning. - Good morning. - We must see the inspector. Well, do you hear? He's got to come along with us right now. - He's still sleeping. - Then go and wake him up. - He'll be real furious. - [Sergeant] Now open the door. - It can't be done. - Why can't it be done? We're in a hurry! - Professor Adelsberg told me that no strangers are to be allowed in... even police. You wait here. (thudding) (birds chirping) - You? - No, no. Too nervous. Much too scared. - Nervous? - It gives me the creeps. Wonder how the inspector can sleep here. - You'd almost say it was a cemetery. I'd much prefer the inn. Smells exactly like death. - Oh. - Smells like everything was rotting. - What if the inspector can't smell very well? - Can't smell that? Bull. (creaking) (knocking) - Inspector. (gasps) Inspector! - [Dorin] What is it? - Two policemen for you outside, Inspector. - Yes, yes. I'm coming. - Inspector, did you sleep well? - Ah, I had a wonderful dream, John. Two beautiful exciting and charming girls standing there by my bed and... - Then what, Inspector? - Oh, no, no, no. It was only dream, John. Do you dream any better or differently? - Hmm. No, I don't. No better. Dream ladies are no good. - No good. Now, shall we go and see what the law wants me for? (John grunts) (coughing) What's up? - Well, we finally have found her. - Maria? - Yes. - She's in a well down at the bottom. - Who was it that found her? (stammering) - It was Nanny who found her. She was on her way to the forest looking for her herbs and she had to pass by there since the path goes right by the old well. - Mm-hmm. And does old Nanny usually look down in the well on her way to the forest? What for? To see if there's water in it suddenly? (stammers) - Nanny says that she saw some black stuff caught on the edge of the well. - "Black stuff"? - Yes, yes. Nylon or something. And then she said she looked down and saw way down there was Maria in a black dress. - Yeah. Interesting. Perhaps she wasn't pleased with the white dress she was wearing. - Oh, mighty God, you're right. It was a white dress, I'm sure. - Yeah. - Well, we better go. - Yes, Inspector. - [Dorin] John, give my apologies to the professor, will you? Don't forget. - It was black! (creaking) (crowd murmuring) - Go get me a ladder. - There isn't one long enough, Inspector. In the whole village there isn't one. - Hmm. Bring me that piece of wood over there. - Yes, sir. - Go get it for the inspector. - [Timid Officer] Here you are, Inspector. Yes, sir. - Go on. - [Timid Officer] Careful, Inspector. - [Sergeant] I need someone to help me. (light grunting) - Oh, sorry. - [Sergeant] Steady. Inspector, you at the bottom? - Now haul the chain up and fasten a strong rope to it, then lower it again. - Yeah, right away. Yes, sir. (eerie music) Let's get him back up. All right now, all together. Keep it moving faster, faster. That's right. - A vampire! (gasping and murmuring) (baby crying) - [Sergeant] Come on, let's get him up. (light grunting) - Well, what do you say now, medicine man? - I think it's quite clear. The killer hid her in the well hoping that no one would come across the body. - I'd like to see that man, Doctor. Must be quite an athlete. - Why? - He jumps with a corpse in arms out of a second story window at the same time making sure the window is locked from the inside and then he disappears without a trace. And why does she have her eyes open? - A result of the fall, I should think. - That sounds logical, but where did she get all those frilly nylon undies? - That's obvious. The killer had to get her other clothes because what she was wearing might give some evidence against him. - I'm curious what Nanny thinks of this theory. - I've already told you... but you won't believe me anyway. Last night there was one peering through my window at midnight, the hour when they roam in search of blood. - Will you stop all this nonsense? It's all useless chatter. It's now a police case. You're wasting your time with this fool. What now, Inspector? - [Dorin] Have you got a morgue here? - Yes, in the graveyard chapel, sir. - And will you see to it that they get the body over to the morgue? - Right. - Right, Inspector. - Will you tell me what you're getting at? - I'm not getting at anything, I'm making use of the death certificate that you've already signed. - Here, didn't you ask for a blood specimen? I don't see what you think you'll find. - Why don't we let a pathologist see what he thinks. - But that suits me fine. Let someone else take the responsibility. (rooster crows) (birds chirping) (ominous music) - That blood is all the proof you need. 100s could be killed with this blood. This is vampire's blood. (birds chirping) - Hello. - Hello. - Can you give me this number, please? Incidentally, remember I got a telegram yesterday. I wondered if there was anyone else here when it arrived. - Well, I don't remember. Oh, yes. There was that negro, the castle servant, he wanted to mail something. He gives me the willies, he does. I don't trust him for a minute. That's my opinion. Yes? Here you are, Inspector. - Hello? Chief? Yes, it's Dorin. I have some difficulties here. Sure, you're right, but suppose I told you I think it's the supernatural? Oh, no, of course I've not been drinking and I'm not crazy. I'm asking for help, chief. Send one of those geniuses of yours down here. - No, no. That would set the press off for sure. I have every confidence in you, Dorin. I'll send nobody. We have to be ready for everything. If you can't clear this up on your own, then just tell me, please, but don't worry me with that business I get from my own agents. - [Dorin] There's something else, Chief. Right after I got here the infrared viewer disappeared. - You must just manage on your own somehow. There's no way I can help. If you can't crack it, tell me. - Okay, I'll keep at it, Chief, naturally, and make some progress. That's all. It's an official call. - Goodbye then, Inspector. (birds chirping and clucking) (ominous music) (rooster crows) (dog barking) (dog barking) (grunting) (groaning) (groaning) (rooster crowing) - Good evening, Professor. - How often must I tell you that you should knock first!? - You won't need to stand for my bad manners very much longer, Professor. I've typed all the last experiments. That finishes my work here and I can leave in the morning. - Oh, you plan to leave us so soon? I know it's been hard on you. I'd hoped that you would think of staying. - That's most flattering of you, Professor, but our agreement was only for three weeks. - I know, I know. You fit so well into the surroundings of this old place. You're rather like new blood for this antique disintegrated place. I've grown rather fond of you. - You're really very kind. - Not at all. Well, I must work now. Would you be good enough to... get the bible that's in the Countess Barbara's quarters? - [Karin] And where's that? - It's directly in back of the choir of the castle chapel. - [Karin] I'm sure I can find it. And what should I say to the Countess? - Well, I doubt very much you'll find her, since she's been dead for 200 years, but... bring along my bible. It's lying on a pillow placed close by her bed. Meanwhile, perhaps I'll be able to... find a way to persuade you to stay. (ominous music) (footsteps echoing) (gasps) (eerie music) - Let me out! Let me out! - Tell me, what's the quickest way to get this sample of blood to the city? - You won't be able to find a single soul who will touch that cursed stuff. - Except Nanny or the doctor, they will. - Right you are, sir. - I can send Nanny into town in my car and you'll drive her for me-- - Oh, you won't get anybody from here to go against the will of the vampires. They're too afraid. - What have the vampires to do with a blood sample? - You try it yourself then, Inspector. I'm willing to bet anything you want that you won't get anybody to do it. - Well, how far is the city? - It's around two hours trip there and back. - If anybody wants me for anything I'll be back in two hours. - Ha! I doubt if you will even get started by then, Inspector. (car clicking) - Now what's gone wrong with this stupid car? - The mechanic took the battery away this morning to be charged, so why not relax? - How am I supposed to get this to the city? - Guess you don't, Inspector. Unfortunately the doctor has the only other car in the village and he's been called away. (eerie music) (gasps) - [Karin] Oh! (gasps) (rhythmic clanging) - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? What's the matter? - I'm looking for Miss Karin. You, Professor, do you know where she might have gone? - Most likely she's up in her room packing. - She's not in her room, sir. - Don't worry. When she's hungry I'm sure she'll turn up for dinner. (footsteps clacking) - Inspector! Inspector! - What is it? - Miss Karin's vanished. - Did you look everywhere? - Everywhere I could, but not there. - Uh-huh. - I'll wait here, Inspector. I'm scared. It's no good. - The dirty work's fallen to me, I see. - Oh, but you don't believe and so you're not afraid. - You'd better stay right here and... - Yes, I'll wait right here. - And come at once if I should call. Karin! - I'll come... - [Dorin] Karin? - Come at once. - [Dorin] Karin! - Here! - [Dorin] I'm coming! - [Karin] Right here! - [Dorin] Karin! - [Karin] I'm here! (groaning) - What kind of a spook house is this? - Oh, please, take me away, Inspector. - First, the name's Frank and second, don't worry, I'm here. It'll be all right. Come along. Wait. (ominous music) Mm-hmm. Either coffins are cheap around here or they haven't got enough beds? - Has someone used this thing as a bed you think? - Yes, just look for yourself. This was slept in, I'm sure. - [Karin] By the professor? - And it's a screwy idea, but... it seems that he's been reading detective stories. - Oh. Oh, please, let's go. - Of course. (eerie music) (wind howling) - What is it? - A book of instructions for vampires. - And that was in that place? - Yes, in the coffin there. "The Mysteries of Black Magic." - Frank, what is it? What's wrong? (telephone ringing) - Hello? Yes? The generator's on full and still no power's coming through. 800 kilowatts are pouring out and still nothing happens! (eerie music) - Frank, I'm frightened. (eerie music) - [John] Inspector. The doctor wants you, Inspector. - [Dorin] Why? What is it? - I have awful news, Inspector. - [Dorin] What is it now? - The corpse is gone again. - Have you looked down the well? - We've looked all over. - Is there any power in the village? - None at all. The whole village is dark. That's what gave me the idea of taking a look at the body. - And the dogs have begun howling? - Yes, but how did you know? Incredible. I think you're right, there's something to what you say. - Karin, we've got to get to the bottom of this. Bring my coat, please. Come along. (eerie music) (dogs howling) - [Doctor] Do you think you can stop these creatures? - Have you finally admitted that we're up against something inhuman? - There isn't anything else I can think. - Well, at last. (Karin gasps) - [Officers] Inspector. (dogs howling) - Was the door forced, Doctor? - No, I made sure it was guarded by the policemen. - How 'bout the window? - Locked from inside. - Footprints around the window? - None. - Hard ground? - No, soft earth. - Then have the church bells rung. - Why, sir? - Within the next 15 minutes, I want all the men assembled in the marketplace, understand? - Right. - And each one must bring six torches with him. - Right. - We will search the whole area. We'll search till we find that body. (wind whistling) (creaking) (whispering) (dog howling) (whispering) - [Dorin] Possibly until morning. I won't give up until we have that body lying in it's coffin. - [Doctor] And I'll sit on it till it's lowered into it's grave. - I'm cold, Frank. I'll wait at the castle. - Alone? - Oh, but I won't be. John will be there with me. - You should let her go. This isn't work for women. - All right. Be careful though. We don't know who these creatures are. Ah, Constable. - Inspector? - I want you to stay with this lady until we get back. - All right, Inspector. (dogs howling) (ominous music) (dogs howling) (eerie music) (wailing) (eerie music) - [Doctor] You'll have a good deal of explaining to do, Inspector. - [Dorin] And you too. I'm expecting you to back me up in this. - [Doctor] In what? - When I tell them that we are dealing with some supernatural phenomenon and not a human. - That's a strange thing to say, Inspector. - Yes, yesterday I would've laughed if someone had suggested that, but now I'm not sup-- (Karin screaming) - What was that? - Karin! - [Karin] No! No! No! (shrieks) No! No! No... (eerie music) (vampire cackling) (dogs howling) - What are you doing? - Nanny's powder. - [Doctor] Dead. - Quick! Let's get her to Nanny. I've got to be sure I've done it right. - You forget that I'm the doctor. - This isn't a case for a doctor. - I'm sorry, you're right, Inspector. - It's right, my boy. You have successfully broken their spell by doing exactly as you were supposed to. And now go. Find their master. When you do, destroy him, and in doing so, you will lift his curse from us. - You said yourself it's impossible to kill these creatures. - No, "They cannot be killed, "they must be destroyed," I said, but one must know how and one must also believe. You, Doctor, you didn't listen to me, did you? You thought me an old foolish superstitious woman. Only he is able to free us from the vampire's curse when the master is found. I must give you these. Don't let them be taken from your hands. You must quietly come upon him in his coffin. One hour after midnight he returns after his nightly wanderings and sleeps in his coffin, without peace, restless, and yearning to rise again and spread his death, then you shall place this stake over his heart. You've only time for three strokes. (wind whistling and bell tolling) - Men, I want you to listen to me! The murderer's in the grotto. I will need your help and together we will destroy him. - No, the men, sir, they won't go in there! Oh, no. - You're fine heroes. - Then I'll go alone. - I'll come with you. - Doctor, you get some men and take a look around the village. - Right. Now, come on. (footsteps echoing) (eerie music) - There! Look. You see it? A shadow. I'm sure it moved. - [Male Figure] Idiot, you wouldn't dare. You must rest. Listen to me, me alone. (footsteps echoing) (eerie music) (cranking) (wailing) (gasps) - We can't be of any help. - There. That's where I was locked in. - And those stairs lead to the room with the coffin. We must go through the castle. (footsteps echoing) (creaking) (thuds) What's the matter, John? What are you doing here? - I'm getting out. I won't ever come back here either. - What happened anyway? - The professor came back suddenly shouting, "Where is my book? You've stolen it!" He wouldn't even listen to me when I said it wasn't me. Then he went wild and then he said, "Get out," so there was nothing else for me to do. I got out of there! - What are you going to do now? - I heard, Inspector, that Miss Karin was leaving in the morning. I want to work for you, Miss Karin, from now on. - That's terribly sweet, but John, my salary isn't big enough to afford you. - We'll talk about this in the morning. We must get back to the grotto, John, come. - But, but the professor is-- - Come. Come on, come on. Hmm. - Here, let me try it, sir. (clangs) - Pretty strong. (eerie music) (footsteps echoing) (eerie music) (vampire screeching) (eerie music) (clangs) (clangs) (clangs) (eerie music) (vampire shrieking) (booms) (vampire shrieking) (sobbing) - What am I to do with her? - Take her upstairs. She's finally found peace. (jaunty pop music) - You don't believe in vampires? I do. (jaunty pop music)
