Every morning, he would run to his letterbox, hoping for an exciting adventure to arrive, all tied up in a parcel. As no one had ever sent him a parcel, Mumfie thought this was the way all adventures came. One day, after waiting a long time, Mumfie decided that adventures might not come in parcels after all. So he ran back to his cottage, took the penny out of his money box, wrapped some cake crumbs carefully in his best handkerchief... and set off into the woods. - "Where are you going?" - ( gasps ) Story Teller: The bird's voice startled Mumfie. "I'm going to find an adventure. Can I bring you back something?" "You can bring back something to hang on this tree." "But this tree is bare. It has no leaves, no fruit. Nothing." "So think of something." "Like a present?" "Exactly," said the bird, and disappeared. Mumfie began to feel nervous. "Come along," he said to himself. "There's no turning back now."

"A what tree?" "A tree with lots of presents on it. And the presents say, 'To Mumfie.' Oh, and Scarecrow, of course." "The only things that I've seen are that field and a few crows. Till you, that is." "Then hurry up, or we'll be late for the adventure." "'To where you came from,'" read Scarecrow. "Well, that would bring us back to the farm, which we don't want. 'To where you want to go.' That sounds all right if it were not for this one which says, 'To where you ought to go.'" "I think we should take the road where we ought to be going," said Mumfie. "Yes, but that doesn't seem to be the same way as we want to go." "And the way we want to go is to an adventure." ( cat mewing ) - "Oh." - "Huh?" "Then I should go the way you want to go, which is the only sensible way, after all." ( meows ) "Come along, Mumfie," said Scarecrow anxiously. "This is the way we want to go." But Mumfie didn't trust the cat. "Please, can we go the other way?" "Here, let me help you to decide." ( grunts ) Cat: "You left these behind. You should learn to look after your things better-rr." Before Mumfie could reply, the cat had vanished. "Scarecrow? Wouldn't you like to sit down for a bit?" "No, thank you. I could go on like this all day." Mumfie wanted to sit down very much. "That looks like a nice field. You could sit down there." ( whimpering, snorting ) "Did you say something? " "No, I thought it was you." ( snorting, whimpering ) "Hello! What are you doing?" - "I'm hiding." - "Why?" "Because the other pigs laugh at me." - "Why?" - "Because..." ( sobs ) "Because..." "Why, bless me if you haven't got..." "Wings! You've got wings.

My name is Mumfie, and this is Scarecrow." "And my name is Pinkey." "Are there... any more of you around here? Distant relatives, I mean." "I'm not sure. ( whines ) I do remember an island... in the middle of a big, blue sea. And then came danger." "What sort of danger?" "I can't remember, but there was mist everywhere and my mother flew me here to safety. I haven't seen her since then. Oh, I do wish I could find her."

Story Teller: Scarecrow rather hoped it wasn't. "Certainly, it's an eye, and what's more, it's my eye. Oh, I don't feel at all well and neither would you if you had a boat stuck under your belly." ( gasps ) "Poor thing. We've got to rescue him, Scarecrow. He's so slippery that if we get him started, he may slide. Look, there's a rope. That'll help."

"It said, 'Come inside for a whale of a time. You'll never leave.'" "Is that all you said?" "Yes. I can't understand why no one replied." "I can." Story Teller: By now, the sun was little more than an orange pip on the far horizon. Pinkey began to shiver. "Brr-rr. It's cold." "Here, my jacket will keep you warm." "How thoughtless of me. You must come inside." "Inside where?" "Inside me, of course." "No, thank you." Story Teller: Scarecrow suddenly began to wonder what whales liked to eat. "Don't be frightened.

"This is lovely," he whispered to Scarecrow. Whale: "It's going to be a long voyage, so why not take a nap now? You'll find hammocks in the cupboard." "Oh, good! Uh, Scarecrow, what's a hammock?" "I hope it's not something to eat. I get very upset when I hear anything with the word 'ham' in it." "Hammocks are, uh, carpets made with, uh, strings." Whale: "Hang them on the brass hooks provided, and I wish you a very good night." "Beds," said Mumfie. "That's what they are. Beds." Story Teller: Now that his guests were safe and warm, Whale turned his mind again to navigation. - Whale: "Ooh!" - "Oh! Where am I?" "Thought I'd never wake you!" ( groans ) "You're in good voice this morning." "Yes, I am! It's wonderful what a good swim can do for the constitution." Pinkey: "Latitude so-and-so, longitude so-and-so." Scarecrow: "Pinkey is doing much better now. She must be feeling more at home." "Home! I can see home!" "There is a funny patch of mist over there. Maybe? Yes! It's the island!" All: "Oh!" "I wouldn't land on that island if I were you. I sense danger there." "We have to go to that island. It's where Pinkey lives." "Pinkey, you'll have to fly to your island. We'll have to swim for it, Mumfie." "No need to swim, take the dinghy!" "I'd like to take you ashore, but I don't want to get stuck again. You do understand." "Of course," replied Mumfie. "Thank you very much." "Man the oars!" "I can't! There aren't any." "They must have fallen overboard in the night. Why not stay here and keep me company?" "We'd like to, but we promised to find Pinkey's mother. - And we can't stop now." - ( grunting ) Story Teller: Then Mumfie had an idea. "Spread your coat like a sail, Scarecrow, and I'll stretch my ears as far as they'll go." "What good will that do? There's no breeze." "Whale will be our breeze and blow us to the shore." "I'll help, too," squeaked Pinkey. "Thank you, Whale! We hope we'll meet again soon!" "Good luck!" Story Teller: Whale quickly sank below the waves, where his tears wouldn't be noticed amongst so much salt water. ( all grunting ) ( Pinkey giggling ) "Well, now what?" Mumfie: "That doesn't look a very friendly sort of forest." Scarecrow: "More like the sort of forest that has wild animals in it." "Will they be very wild, do you think?" "Perhaps not very wild, more sort of 'wildish.'" "Perhaps we should save some of our breakfast for them? That might make any wild animals sort of friendly-ish." Story Teller: Everyone thought this was a very good idea... so they started to unpack the food Whale had given them. "Mmm, pies and doughnuts." "I know the best thing to put into pies," laughed Mumfie. - "What's that?" - "Teeth." ( all laughing ) ( wind whistling ) "I think we should start exploring, don't you?" "I suppose so." Story Teller: Scarecrow secretly wished they could stay in the sunlight. The forest grew darker and darker. Mumfie: "Scarecrow, have you noticed?" "Noticed what?" "There aren't any birds singing. Whoever heard of a forest without birds?" "Uh, perhaps they're all asleep or, uh, gone to a wedding or something." ( gasps ) "Oh, my beautiful best hat. The only thing I've had that wasn't secondhand." "Never mind," comforted Mumfie. "The hole will give it character. You can cry into my handkerchief if it helps." Story Teller: So Scarecrow cried into a corner of Mumfie's handkerchief, and this made him feel much better. ( whispering ) "Exploring a forest is all right if you could keep to the edges. It's not so dark at the edges." "And if you're only on the edges, you can always step out into the open again." "I hadn't thought of that. You must know an awful lot about forests." "Well, I am made of wood, so I'm sort of part forest myself." "Oh! There's the sky again!" "Look at all these notices. 'No laughing.' 'No smiling'? 'No ball games.' 'No fun of any kind'?" "What an awful place." "It gets worse. 'No whistling.' 'No dancing.' And 'No singing.'" "Well! That explains everything," declared Mumfie. ♪ No wonder this place is so gloomy ♪ ♪ If you're not allowed to whistle, dance or sing ♪ ♪ A world without melody to me ♪ ♪ Would be a dull and melancholy thing ♪ ♪ When a silence lasts too long ♪ ♪ I just have to start a song ♪ ♪ And the notes pour out and the music comes ♪ ♪ And I'm blowing horns and I'm banging drums ♪ ♪ Like a circus clown, I march around the ring ♪ ♪ Gotta dance, gotta whistle ♪ ♪ Gotta sing. ♪ ( wind whistling ) "I don't think you should sing anymore.

This isn't an adventure, this is hard work." Story Teller: Mumfie tried pushing the door open, but it was shut fast. ( grunts ) He made one last big effort to break free. This wasn't a good idea at all. It's lucky that elephants, even small ones, are stronger than most animals because Mumfie fell a very long way and was very glad to reach the bottom. ( grunts ) "Now," thought Mumfie, "do I go this way or that?" Then he noticed something. "Perhaps that light means that there is another way back." Story Teller: Mumfie didn't really believe this, but was determined to say anything that would cheer himself up, and he felt so much better that he set off towards the light. Pinkey: "Perhaps he's hiding behind one of the trees." "Which one? They all look alike." "Oh, come on. It'll be like a game of hide-and-seek. You take one side of the forest, I'll take the other, and we'll soon find him." Story Teller: When Mumfie reached the end of the tunnel, he couldn't believe his eyes. ( gasps ) "It's a pig! And I do believe... oh, my goodness... she's got wings!" "Excuse me," whispered Mumfie, "but are you Pinkey's mother? Then cheer up! Because we brought her back to you." Story Teller: But Mumfie's news didn't make Pinkey's mother happy at all. "Oh, no! Now the Secretary will make Pinkey a prisoner, too." "Who's the Secretary?" "He's the one who's turned this whole island into a prison. I sent Pinkey away so that she wouldn't fall into his clutches. Now she'll be trapped like everyone else." "So that's why this place is so gloomy. Well, I'll have to find a way to help you both." Cat: "Hmm, how?" "Well, I'm going to think about that." ( gasps ) "Uh, maybe I'll think faster if I take a run for it." ( meowing ) Story Teller: Mumfie raced off with the cat in noisy pursuit. "Get out of my way!" Story Teller: But the cat took no notice. "Slow down! I only want you to tickle me behind the ears." "Tickle you?" "Oh, go on. What have you got to lose?" "If I do, then will you get out of my way?" ( purring ) "You're lucky I can do this." "You're right. I am lucky." Story Teller: And with that, the cat turned tail down the stairs. Mumfie continued up the stairs. ( snoring ) "'This chair belongs to Bristle'?" "'Bristle'? That's my name. Prison guard extraordinaire to His Majesty the Secretary of Night. Rule 4929-- 'Do not disturb.' You just have. Can't you read?" "I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I'm Mumfie." "Hah! Obviously a troublemaker. You can wait here." "Ooh!" Bristle: "The Secretary's collection is long overdue for a dusting. Get to it." Story Teller: Mumfie gazed at the biggest collection of bottles he had ever seen, and they had the strangest labels. "'Children's laughter.' 'Birds singing.' 'Bees humming.'" ( sighs ) Mumfie set slowly to work. "The wind carried Mumfie away when he started singing and dancing. Perhaps if we do the same, the wind will send us in the same direction." "I'm not very good at singing. I can never remember the words." "Oh, you just sing 'la-la-la' or whatever comes into your head." Both: ♪ La-la-la ♪ ♪ Or whatever comes into your head ♪ ♪ La-la-la ♪ ♪ Or whatever comes into your head ♪ ♪ La-la-la... ♪ "It's working! Now let's try dancing." Both: ♪ La-la-la ♪ ♪ Or whatever comes into your head ♪ ♪ La-la-la ♪ ♪ Or whatever comes into your head ♪ ♪ La-la-- ♪ "Oh, ooh!" "Ooh! Hold tight, Pinkey." ( yelling ) ( Scarecrow grunts ) "We're in," cried Pinkey. Both: "Where's Mumfie?" Story Teller: Mumfie was trying to open one of the bottles, but it was sealed tight with wax. ( sneezes ) "Oh." "That is definitely danger. Pinkey and her mother are right about this island." ( coughing ) "Oh!" ( sneezing ) Story Teller: Mumfie carefully edged his way towards the coughing sound. ( coughing ) "Oh! I'm so sorry. Did I disturb you, too?" "No." ( coughs ) "It's just the dust." ( coughs ) "Oh, dear. Can I get you anything?" Story Teller: Mumfie looked up at the shelves in case he could see some cough mixture. "Get on with the dusting. No need to trouble about a poor old bird like me." ( coughs ) "Who's this?" "This, ah, is the Queen of Night. She looked after all the island from sunset to sunrise until he took over." "Who?" "Her Secretary. He began by trapping all the joyful sounds in these bottles. And now he's stolen her magic." "That must have been the Secretary I saw at the window." ( shudders ) I felt so cold." "This used to be the Queen's room-- an 'appy room." "I can tell just by looking at the sunshine that's left over." ( sneezes ) - ( crashes ) - ( gasps ) "That's torn it. Get some of that gray powder in the jar just over your head. That's right! Now sprinkle it over the liquid before it soaks in." "Oh, how beautiful! It's just like the jewel in your painting." "It's the Queen's jewel and very precious. Put it in your pocket and never lose it. Bonne chance, good luck. If you wouldn't mind putting the cover back on." "But you're a prisoner like this." "I'm a has-been, a failure, a write-off." "But you can help me." "I can't help anyone. I couldn't even help the Queen of Night. I ran away under these covers. I did the one thing no self-respecting raven should ever do." "What's that?"

"Very well, then, I'm Napoleon Jones, aid to Her Majesty, the Queen of Night, back in circulation." "And I'm Mumfie. Come on!" Story Teller: Whilst Mumfie kept Pinkey's mother company, Napoleon started to peck away at the pin in the hinges of the great iron door. "One down, one to go." ( whistle tweets ) "Got ya! You've broken rule number 439B-- interfering with prison property." "I couldn't help myself. I was feeling peckish." "And that's a highly illegal jacket your friend's wearing." "What's wrong with it?" "It's pink! Pink is a forbidden color-- rule 265P." "Nonsense!" "Nonsense is especially forbidden-- rules 417A, B and C." "Is there anything that isn't forbidden?" "Yes, rules! This here book's full of them. Anyone disturbing the peace or interfering with the Secretary's plans to create eternal darkness must be locked away forever... including you." "It's rude to point-- rule, uh, 700 and ninepins." Story Teller: Bristle had never heard of "rule 700 and ninepins." ( scoffs ) "The Secretary of Night shall decide your punishment. Now put that pin back." "Do it yourself." - "Oh, yes?" - "Yes." "Well done," whispered Mumfie. Story Teller: And for the first time in ages, there was a proud gleam in Napoleon's old eyes. "Is the Secretary of Night really so terrible?" "A rotter of the first rank. Cold as a fish with a face like a flounder to match." "On your marks, and don't try and run or I'll break you into little pieces." Story Teller: But Bristle's threats gave Mumfie an idea. He still had one paper napkin left from the picnic on the beach. If he made a trail, then maybe Scarecrow and Pinkey would find it. "Follow me," ordered Bristle, who loved orders even more than rules. He stomped off briskly and never noticed Mumfie scattering the pieces of paper behind him. ( sniffing ) "Mumfie must have gone this way. Follow me." "There's somebody coming. Quick, hide!" Story Teller: The Secretary's shadowy figure that Mumfie had first seen at the window now entered the room. "When the Queen's jewel is set into this ring, my power will be complete. Is the formula ready?" "Nearly. The potion is brewed, and the powder is ground. It remains only to mix them." "You may leave that to me. Well, where is it, you useless, mangy feline fur ball?" Story Teller: Before the cat could answer, the Secretary suddenly remembered. "The little elephant was in this room. The little elephant has taken the formula. We'll search the island while the night wind is here. If we don't find that little elephant, then my guard, Bristle, already has him prisoner." "Hurry along, there. Hurry along. We mustn't keep the Secretary of Night waiting." Story Teller: But Mumfie wanted to talk to Napoleon. "Why is this jewel so precious?" he whispered, making sure it was safely tucked in his pocket. "Because it contains a formula that the Queen says is a treasure beyond price. That's why it must never fall into the hands of the wicked Secretary." "What is the formula?" "Nobody knows except the Queen and her Secretary, of course. But you have all that is left of the formula in your pocket." "Oh, I wish Scarecrow was here. I hope he finds us soon." Story Teller: Scarecrow was trying his hardest to find Mumfie. "Oh! What a beautiful garden." Story Teller: Suddenly, from out of the shadows, they heard a voice. "Who are you?" said the lady, "and what are you doing in my garden?" "I'm sorry if we were trespassing. We're trying to find our friend Mumfie." "I'm Her Majesty, Queen of Night." Story Teller: Scarecrow immediately fell to one knee. Someone had once told him that's what you do when you meet Her Majesties. "You look very sad, Your Majesty." "My Secretary wishes to turn all that is good to evil. He has stolen my Cloak of Dreams, with all my magic woven through it, and locked up all who live here." "What does the cloak look like?" "It is big enough to cover the world and small enough to fit into a thimble." "Well, it certainly sounds distinctive enough. I give you my word, Your Majesty, as soon as we've found Mumfie..." "And my mother." "...and Pinkey's mother, our next task will be to recover your cloak." ( purring ) ( gasps ) "Wait, you've forgotten your umbrella." "We'll look after it." Story Teller: The umbrella twinkled with stars, and Scarecrow was so busy admiring them that for a few moments, he noticed nothing but their brightness. "What a lovely lake." "Lake? This is the ice floor of the Queen of Night's palace. Correction-- the Secretary of Night's palace, and he'll be passing a heavy sentence on you. No more nattering until we get a pair of skates that fit you." "Why is the palace floor made of ice?" "What else would a palace floor be made of? Besides, this ice makes it tres... uh, 'very' awkward for unauthorized persons to get into the palace." "Put these on." "Are you going to skate, too? Wouldn't you be more comfortable flying?" Story Teller: Bristle began to laugh in that creaky way that usually means someone is about to say something nasty. "When the Secretary came to power, first thing he did was to clip that old bird's wings. His flying days are over... forever." Story Teller: Napoleon did his best to ignore Bristle's taunts. "I'll help you with your skates, and then you can help me with mine." Story Teller: It was against the rules for Bristle to ask for help, so he had to put his skates on himself. - ( Bristle grunting ) - This was Mumfie's chance. On the last scrap of the napkin he wrote, Mumfie: "'Skates in the box seat, follow tracks on ice.'" "Ready?" "I've never... skated before."

"This is definitely Mumfie's writing. You can see the trouble he took over it." Story Teller: To Scarecrow's surprise, he managed to pick up skating quite easily. "I didn't know you could skate." "Neither did I." "If it wasn't for Mumfie," thought Scarecrow, "I'd still be stuck in a field. Life can bring the most wonderful surprises." Then aloud he cried, "To the rescue!" "To the rescue!"

The Secretary's bound to steal it again." "We've got to make sure this jewel is really safe, then." ( gasps ) "We'll put the Queen's jewel inside Whale. Then we'll know that it's safe." "You'll have to start your journey right away. There's no time to lose." "How are we gonna get there? " "I'd offer to take the Queen's jewel myself, but I've nowhere to put it." "But you could fly ahead and tell Whale that we need him." Story Teller: Pinkey didn't reply. She was worried about leaving her mother alone again. Mumfie guessed what she was thinking. "Your mother wants you to be safe. She'll feel happier if you leave the island for now. Besides, this is important work. She'll be proud of you." "I'll do it. It'll be my first solo long-distance flight, nonstop." Story Teller: Without another word, she launched herself into the air and disappeared. "Useless, that's all I am. Useless." "Nonsense, it would be a great help if you would go back and explain to Pinky's mother what we're doing." Story Teller: Still muttering mournfully, Napoleon did as he was asked. Scarecrow and Mumfie looked at each other. "Have you thought of anything?" "No." "Well, let's put up the Queen's umbrella, and we'll both sit underneath it. It will be easier to think in the dark. Help! We're taking off! Ooh!" ( gasps ) "Have you still got the jewel?" "Yes, it's here, safe and sound." Scarecrow: "This is just like magic." "This is magic, the Queen's magic. There must be some left in her umbrella." Story Teller: The wind carried them higher and higher into the air. "Oh, look! The ocean is covered in silver." "And can you see what I see, Mumfie?" Mumfie: "It's Whale and Pinkey. Let's wave to them. Oh, my gosh!" Story Teller: Mumfie watched the Queen's jewel falling far away from him, disappearing down into the depths of the ocean. "How splendid to see you again! Pinkey tells me you need my help." "It isn't splendid at all. I've lost the Queen's jewel. It fell into the sea. We'll never find it now." "Never say never. You need a first-class navigator, and I know just the man, but you'll have to find him first. There's someone waiting inside who can tell you all about him. Mrs. Admiral, I'd like to introduce you to some friends of mine. They're in a bit of a pickle themselves." "What perfect timing. I just made hot buttered scones and a fresh pot of tea."

It's so much quieter down there, except for them pesky pirates." "Maybe the pirates have found the Queen's jewel." "Huh. Wouldn't put it past them. Anything's possible with them pirates." "Look out! ( grunts ) Oh!" "Sorry about that. Pirates on the port bow." "Hang on," boomed Whale, and immediately dived. Story Teller: Whale descended deeper into the ocean. Mumfie and the others were glad when Whale switched on the lights, but this was a bad mistake. The lights could clearly be seen by the pirates through the darkness. "We're near your home, Mrs. Admiral," whispered Whale. "Best jump ship while I lead the pirates a merry dance." "I'll keep Whale company," decided Pinkey, who preferred not to get her wings wet. Mumfie didn't like swimming either, but there was no time to argue. Breathing under the water wasn't a problem because Mumfie is a special elephant and Scarecrow part made of wood. "Join hands. We have to stick together or you might get lost." Story Teller: Then Whale made his second mistake. He flapped his tail. - Mrs. Admiral: "Oh!" - Mumfie: "Oh!" Mumfie, Scarecrow and Mrs. Admiral spun off in different directions through the muddy darkness of the ocean. Scarecrow floated the furthest. There was no sign of the others. "Mumfie?" Story Teller: Then in the distance, he saw a sudden flash of light. Scarecrow found that he could now manage walking quite easily. Stranger still, he no longer felt wet or cold. "It can't be," murmured Scarecrow. But it was. Scarecrow: "It's a lighthouse under the sea. Maybe Mumfie has seen it, too. Perhaps he is waiting for me there at this very minute." Story Teller: This idea made Scarecrow feel so happy that he started to run towards the lighthouse. He read the notice pinned upon the door. "'If you can't reach the knocker, ring the bell. P.S.-- You'd better have a jolly good reason for doing either.' I've got a jolly good reason for doing either. I'm looking for my best friend." Story Teller: So he not only knocked, he rang the bell loudly as well. "Yes, sir?" "I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm looking for my friend Mumfie." "And what's a 'mumf' when it's at home?" "It's an elephant, only very little, stands on two legs and wears a pink jacket." "A jacket like this one?" ( gasps ) "Where did you get that?" "My good friend the shark give it to me. He thought I could use it to polish the lighthouse lamps." "But it's all torn." "Ah, yes. The shark's teeth must have done that." "Oh, no. "You don't think the shark could have--" "Eaten your friend Mumf? More than likely, but they don't mean nothing by it. It's just their way." Story Teller: Scarecrow felt tears spring in his eyes. "I'll have that back now. If your friend's been eaten, he certainly won't be needing a jacket. Although, come to think, I did see a funny-looking object with wobbly legs bumbling about aimless-like towards the sand dunes." "That's Mumfie! I must find him." "Impetuous bundle of sticks." Story Teller: But Scarecrow was already too far away to hear. "Hmm," murmured Scarecrow. "Could that be Mrs. Admiral's house?" ( clanging ) Story Teller: And it was! "Scarecrow! Thank Neptune you're safe." "I may be safe, but Mumfie isn't." Story Teller: Mrs. Admiral hurried Scarecrow inside. "What's this about Mumfie?" Story Teller: Scarecrow took a deep breath. "I think he's been eaten by a shark." And he held out his handkerchief in case she needed it. But Mrs. Admiral's reaction to the news was not what Scarecrow expected at all. "How can you laugh?" "Just you wait and see." Story Teller: Mrs. Admiral lifted up the cover of the big dish. Underneath was an enormous pile of mashed potatoes. And behind that... was Mumfie! - "Mumfie!" - "Scarecrow! I gave that shark my jacket in return for showing me the way here. So I'm wearing one of Mr. Admiral's castoffs, cut down to size." "Now sit down and have your supper." Story Teller: All the excitement had made them very hungry, and Mrs. Admiral had made the mashed potatoes just the way Mumfie liked them-- creamy, white and fluffy... like the sheets in the bedroom where they were to sleep that night. "I hope you won't find the room too stuffy. We can't open the windows in case the fish get in." Story Teller: But Mumfie and Scarecrow said they were sure they'd both be very comfortable, so she wished them good night, and they both got ready for bed.

"You mean being underwater?" "No, sleeping in a real bed. I've only ever slept in a hammock in Whale, and before that, standing up in the middle of a field." Story Teller: Mumfie thought it must be very hard to sleep standing up. This made him snuggle even further into the sheets. "We must find Whale tomorrow and the Queen's jewel and maybe even the Admiral." Story Teller: Scarecrow was just about to ask how they would do this all in one day... when he fell asleep. Beyond the bedroom window, the real ocean hugged the little house all night long, whispering the many secrets an ocean shares only with itself. "Thank you for mending my coat, Mrs. Admiral." "Come on, Mumfie. I've an idea all this searching is going to be a long job." "Do you think it's going to be a very long job? I mean, do you think it is likely to keep us until after dinner? Perhaps we'd better take something along with us. You know how you always get hungry, Scarecrow." Story Teller: At that moment, Mrs. Admiral produced a picnic basket with lunch and dinner inside. Then she gave them a last word of advice. "Davy Jones, the captain of them pirates, is a dark and dangerous man. So be on your guard at all times." "Look, Scarecrow. There's a lot of big sponges growing over there. I wonder if they grow soap down here, too." ( giggles ) Story Teller: All that morning, they crossed the wide expanse of sand, but although they saw many strange and wonderful things... there was no sign of Whale or Mr. Admiral. "These cliffs look more interesting." "It's going to be jolly hard to climb them." "Perhaps we won't have to. Look!" Story Teller: At the base of the cliff was the entrance to a big cave. Mumfie: "If I was a pirate, that's just the sort of place I'd store my treasure." Story Teller: As they drew nearer, they both knew that Mumfie was right. Mumfie: "Skull and crossbones." "That means pirates." "Isn't this exciting?" Story Teller: But Scarecrow was more than a little afraid. As he looked at the dark mouth of the cave, he suddenly felt homesick for the dull, empty field he'd left so long ago. Mumfie looked up at him and smiled. - "Ready?" - "Ready." Story Teller: So they stepped carefully into the shadows of the mysterious cave. "Uh, have you ever met any pirates, Scarecrow?" "Not sea pirates. The farm I looked after was too far away from the beach." "Then have you met any farm pirates?" "Not many. I think you only get them on fish farms." Story Teller: Mumfie nodded, and then after a little pause he added nervously, "Do they ever have fish farms in caves, Scarecrow?" Story Teller: Scarecrow was just about to suggest that perhaps this cave was a little too dark for fish farms, pirates or anything else when something happened. "What was that?" Story Teller: Before Mumfie could answer... it happened again! "I feel all crackly. Scarecrow, are my ears sticking up?" "I don't know, but whatever it was, I wish it had lasted longer so we could see where we're going." Story Teller: By now, it was so dark that they could see nothing at all. "Ooh! Dead end. We'll have to turn back." Story Teller: There was no reply. "Scarecrow? Are you all right?" Story Teller: Mumfie began to feel afraid. "Scarecrow? Please say something." Story Teller: Mumfie saw that he was alone in the empty cave. "I think I'd like this bit of the adventure to be over now. Whatever is going to happen next?" ( gasps ) "Oh, you're a fish," said Mumfie. "I'm an eel," said the eel. "Electric eel. You don't get electric fish in here, do you?" "I don't know." "Well, I'm telling you, you don't." Story Teller: And the eel crackled again. "You're very bright." "Thank you. I always was bright, even as a child. Wait a bit, I'll turn myself down. No point in wasting electricity. And what are you?" "I'm lost. I mean, I've lost my friend, Scarecrow." "Is that the skinny fella with the sticking-out hair?" Story Teller: Mumfie secretly thought this was an unkind but true description of his missing friend. "Have you seen him?" "You went one way, and he went the other. I thought you'd had an argument." Scarecrow: "Mumfie! Where are you?" "That's Scarecrow." Story Teller: And as quick as a flash, the eel replied, "Follow my light!" Story Teller: With the help of the electric eel... "Ooh!" ...Mumfie and Scarecrow were soon reunited. "Now, back to business. We're looking for pirates. Can you help us find them? We're trying to find Mr. Admiral. We're afraid the pirates may have captured him." "This way. Let's look on the bright side." Story Teller: And without another word, Eel set off at a crackling pace. "Oh, Scarecrow, just look at this." Story Teller: There below them, lying in the middle of a seaweed forest, was the pirate ship Sea Witch. "What are the pirates doing?" Eel giggled. "Singing. Listen." ♪ There's no escaping the buccaneers ♪ ♪ If you're afloat, we'll find you ♪ ♪ Should you happen to sail too near ♪ ♪ Keep on looking behind you ♪ ♪ Without a warning, we'll be there ♪ ♪ With the guns of the fleet set ♪ ♪ As you sink, we'll give a cheer ♪ ♪ Sorry to get your feet wet ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're bad, mad ♪ ♪ Dangerous to know ♪ ♪ Haul away, me hearties ♪ ♪ With a hearty heave-ho ♪ ♪ When we wave our Jolly Roger ♪ ♪ You'll be quivering with fear ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're cruising for a bruising ♪ ♪ With a buccaneer. ♪ ( laughing ) Man: "Ahoy, matey!" "Humph. Now you can see what you're up against." "Yes, indeed. But I'm sure we'll find the Admiral in that pirate ship so we have to go there. Come on." Story Teller: That was one of the things Scarecrow liked best about Mumfie. "He's not a 'what-iffer,'" he thought to himself. "What-iffer" was Scarecrow's name for people who would say things like, "What if he's not on board the ship?" Or "What if we are captured by pirates?" Deep down, Scarecrow felt he was a bit of a "what-iffer" himself. On board the Sea Witch, Captain Davy Jones and his crew's noisy reveling grew louder and louder. ♪ We search the ocean for pirate loot ♪ ♪ We sail whatever the weather ♪ ♪ Our skin's as tough as an old sea boot ♪ ♪ Our faces hard as leather ♪ ♪ We've broken teeth and a bruiser's nose ♪ ♪ Like soft-boiled eggs our eyes is ♪ ♪ If we entered a beauty show ♪ ♪ We wouldn't win any prizes ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're bad, mad ♪ ♪ Dangerous to know ♪ ♪ Haul away, me hearties ♪ ♪ With a hearty heave-ho ♪ ♪ When we wave our Jolly Roger ♪ ♪ You'll be quivering with fear ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're cruising for a bruising ♪ ♪ With a buccaneer. ♪ ( chattering, laughing ) ♪ Though we're vicious as pirates go ♪ ♪ We're not as black as we're painted ♪ ♪ We never tread on a lady's toe ♪ ♪ Or tickle a man when he's fainted ♪ ♪ And when again in ports we lie ♪ ♪ All evil thoughts we smother ♪ ♪ We even put on a shirt and tie ♪ ♪ Before we visit our mother ♪ ♪ Still we're bad, mad ♪ ♪ Dangerous to know ♪ ♪ Haul away, me hearties ♪ ♪ With a hearty heave-ho ♪ ♪ When we wave our Jolly Roger ♪ ♪ You'll be quivering with fear ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're cruising for a bruising ♪ ♪ It won't be of your choosing ♪ ♪ Cruising for a bruising ♪ ♪ With a big, bad ♪ ♪ Buccaneer. ♪ Story Teller: As Mumfie, Scarecrow and Eel crept towards the ship, Eel grew especially bright. "We're very grateful for your help, but it's not very easy to creep up on anyone with you crackling so much." "Sorry, but the nearer I get to these pirates, the angrier I become." "How well do you know the waters around here?" "Like the back of my hat. Why? Do you want me to shed a bit of light on something?" "Whale. We'd like you to find him. And Pinkey. And make sure they're both safe, if you can." "Of course I can," flashed the eel. "See you later." Story Teller: And she darted away. Silently, Mumfie and Scarecrow began their search. "Scarecrow, there's a man in there with red hair. I'm sure it's the Admiral. He looks just like the man in the photo that Mrs. Admiral showed to us." Story Teller: Mumfie started tapping on the porthole to get the man's attention. But Scarecrow was having an attack of the "what-iffers." "What if it wasn't the Admiral? What if he's a pirate instead? What if he's deaf?" Story Teller: But the Admiral wasn't deaf. "We found him," shouted Mumfie. "We've found the Admiral!" "And what do you think you're doing? Answer my question, you dogs." "I'm not a dog, I'm an elephant." "Get up that rope ladder, and let's have no more of your sauce." "I haven't given you any sauce, cheese or otherwise." Story Teller: This made the pirate roar even more. "One million and one..." Story Teller: On deck, Captain Davy Jones was counting up the day's takings. "Who's this horrible-looking thing?" "I don't know," said Mumfie, looking at the pirate. "He didn't give his name." "Not him! You!" "How do you do? My name is Mumfie and this is Scarecrow." "This is Nasty Nate, the scourge of the Foxhall, and I'm the wicked Captain Davy Jones." "How do you do?" said Mumfie, bowing politely. The captain was so surprised by this, he bowed back. Scarecrow put out his hand, but the captain ignored it. "Never mind all the la-di-da-nis. What are you doing here?" "We've been looking for the Admiral." "Admi-reel? You mean our washer boy, don't ya?" "No, I don't think the Admiral's a boy. He's got a big, red beard." "Take these scurvy swabs to the laundry room. They're all washed up, just like the Admireel." Story Teller: And he laughed a very nasty laugh of the kind that pirates perfect during their years of villainy on the high seas. ( laughs ) Meanwhile, the electric eel continued her searching for Whale and Pinkey. She was growing tired, and this made her cross with herself. Sparks flew everywhere as she explored a particularly rocky part of the seabed. At last, her patience was rewarded. "There he is!" "Looks like you're in a spot of trouble. Your friends will be glad I found you." "I'd be much obliged if you'd turn your lights down. I'd rather not be seen in this sorry state." "It's not your fault. It's those pesky pirates. And by the look of these ropes, they've certainly been up to their old tricks again. Now, good-looking, I think I can get you out of this net, but I'll need a little help from my friends. I'll be back in a flash." Story Teller: By now, Mumfie and Scarecrow had reached the darkest, most rat-infested corner of the ship. The Admiral wasn't at all pleased to have visitors. He scowled at Nasty Nate. "What do you want now, you lime-scamping prawn with a galley-pickled sprat brain?" ( gasps ) Nasty Nate couldn't cope with so many insults all at once and almost burst into tears. "I brought you some helpers. And by the way, Captain Jones said that the last batch of shirts had too much starch in them. So watch it!" ( slams door ) The Admiral turned to Mumfie. "Mrs. Admiral asked us to find you. She misses you very much." "Hmm. And don't I miss the old girl." "Perhaps we could... break the door down?" "You saw how thick it was." "Well, at least we can try." "One, two, three, push!"

"Thank you very much, but I'm not going anywhere. Mumfie and Scarecrow may need me here." "I'll find out if they need you. But I'll have to lie down first and recharge my batteries." "That's it! All done!" Story Teller: And Eel whizzed away as fast as she could towards the pirate ship. Mumfie, Scarecrow and the Admiral had tried hard to open the heavy cabin door. They felt tired and depressed. "What about the porthole?" "Nothing can get through here except fish." Story Teller: At that very moment, through the opening came Eel. "I freed Whale." "But now we're prisoners ourselves." Humph. "This is a fine kettle of fish you've got yourselves into." Story Teller: Suddenly, Mumfie had an idea. "Now listen..." Story Teller: Deep in the bowels of the pirate ship Sea Witch, the captain peered through his periscope. At that moment, the wicked Secretary of Night flew into his sight with an offer the captain could not refuse. "Captain Jones, I have need of your services. If you can find the Queen's Jewel of Power and bring it to me, then I shall rule the land and you the seas." Story Teller: This idea appealed to the captain so much that he immediately began preparations for his search. "What if the old bird can't be found? What if the evil Secretary has caught him instead? What if he can't read?" "Putting a message in a bottle is a fine nautical custom, but it could be years before the bottle is washed up anywhere." "Uh, not if Eel guided it to the beach." Story Teller: Scarecrow wanted to make up for sounding so gloomy. "What a good idea! We'll need Pinkey, too. Listen..." Story Teller: Whale was waiting patiently for news of his friends. Eel told him about Mumfie's plan. "I know all the shortcuts through these waters, and I can hide more easily than you if the pirates try to catch me. So it's best if I take the message." Story Teller: Then Eel darted along the line of portholes in search of Pinkey. "'Dear Napoleon, we have been captured by underwater pirates. Here is a map of our whereabouts. Anything you can do to help would be much appreciated. Uh, hope you are well and that this finds you as it leaves us. Kindest regards from Mumfie, Scarecrow and the Admiral.'" ( pops ) Story Teller: When Eel appeared at the porthole, Mumfie thought that she was alone. "Didn't you find Pinkey?" "Yes, of course I did." "Well, where is she?" "I'll show you, but keep it under your hat." "I know Pinkey is afraid to get her wings wet, and this way she won't get them wet at all." Story Teller: Everyone wished Pinkey and Eel good luck, and with a last wave of her tail, Eel was gone. No one on deck noticed her wriggling towards the surface. Only the lookout in the crow's nest saw her pass. But he just shrugged to himself and thought, "An eel with a bottle. Yet another unsolved mystery of the deep." And went back to writing postcards home. ( whimpering ) "Thank goodness! It was getting very stuffy under there. I'll lead the way now, if you'd like." "Don't go too fast. My batteries are running low again." ( pants ) Story Teller: Summoning up all her strength, Eel began battling her way toward Pinkey's island. The tide was against her, and she could feel her strength ebbing away with every stroke of her tail. "I'll have to rest for a moment. It's further than I thought. We should have used a smaller bottle." ( panting ) Story Teller: Eel's aching jaws could hold the bottle no longer. It started to drift away. Eel was too weak to stop it. But Pinkey wasn't tired at all. "Oh, well done, Pinkey. But your wings are getting wet." "But they still work anyway. ( giggles ) This is fun. Tell me when you're ready." Story Teller: So Eel rested against the rock and soon brightened up again. Eel: "Come on, we're nearly at the beach." Story Teller: Meanwhile, Mumfie had been making further plans for escape. "How do we look?" "No odder than some of the 'coves' that work for Davy Jones." "But how are we going to get out of here?" Story Teller: The answer came sooner than expected. It was Nasty Nate with more dirty washing. "Who are you?" Story Teller: The disguises were getting him in a muddle. "I've seen you somewheres before, haven't I?" "I'm a new crew member." ( chuckles ) "With orders to give the prisoner some exercise on deck." "I'd have thought all this ironing was exercise enough, but if it's captain's orders..." Story Teller: Scarecrow had difficulty seeing through the gap in the pirate's coat. ( grunts ) Nasty Nate: "Hurry up, you miserable numbskull." "We're out," whispered Mumfie. Pinkey and Eel reached the island at last. "Now it's up to you, Pinkey. But this bottle is too heavy for you to carry. Just a minute." ( singing high note ) ( smashes ) Story Teller: Eel watched Pinkey carry the message into the mist. Then she slid back into the water and started her long journey home. At first Pinkey was lost. She had found the paper trail, but she had followed it the wrong way. It brought her back to her mother's cell. Pinkey longed to wake her. "Best not," she said to herself firmly. "She'll be free soon enough if I can get this message to Napoleon in time." Story Teller: Pinkey decided to trace the paper back to the place where Napoleon had last been seen. In front of her was the ice floor, but there was no sign of Napoleon. Pinkey turned sadly away. Suddenly, Pinkey heard something. ( grunts ) "Napoleon!" ( bones cracking ) "Bristle woke up just after your bunch escaped and thought this box was the best place for me. I've been trying to peck my way out ever since." "Here's a message for you from Mumfie." Bristle: "409B." ( gasps ) "It's Bristle. Time to beat a hasty retreat." "But we can't go back, and you don't have time to put on skates." "There is no way out." ( gasps ) "Bristle will be here any minute." ( grunts ) "Then I'm afraid we're trapped." Story Teller: Pinkey looked at the vast ice floor of the Queen's palace. "No, we're not. You've got wings. You can fly like me." "It's impossible. I had my wings clipped long ago." "How long ago?" "Oh, ages and ages ago." "Well, perhaps they've grown back again." "It's your only chance." ( sighs ) "I wonder." Napoleon stretched out first one wing, then the other. "They look pretty healthy to me, and I don't think I can fly back to find Whale all by myself." "Well, if you're willing to risk it." ( gasps ) "I'll risk it," cried Pinkey. ( yelling ) And the next moment, they were up and away.

( sniffing ) Story Teller: Pinkey sniffed the air, but all she could smell was the salt from the sea below. "I'll just have to do my best to remember. I think we should head in the direction of those waves over there. And I'll tell you all about the pirates as we go. Look! There he is!" Story Teller: On board the Sea Witch, a pirate was swabbing the deck as a punishment for not eating up all his breakfast. Nasty Nate stepped out on the deck. He still did not realize that the pirate escorting the Admiral was really Mumfie and Scarecrow in disguise. "Not much room to exercise here," said Mumfie hopefully. "We'll just take him for a run around the boat instead." "Are you sure this is according to captain's orders?" "Why don't you ask him?" Davy Jones: "Ask him what?" Story Teller: It was Captain Davy Jones himself. He stared at the mysterious pirate. "Who's this?" "I don't know, but his face is very familiar." "His coat's even more familiar. It's mine!" Story Teller: Unfortunately Mumfie had chosen Captain Jones' favorite outfit. "Take it off, you, you scurvy dog!" "All right, but you're going to get an awful shock." Scarecrow: "Oh!" Story Teller: Something bright was shining out of the captain's pocket. Mumfie was amazed. "It's the Queen's jewel," he thought to himself. "The captain's got the Queen's jewel." "It's them stowaways!" Story Teller: The captain prepared to strike, but the Admiral was too quick for him. "Argh!" "I've got it!" "After them!" Story Teller: By the time the pirates had recovered, Mumfie and the others had reached the forest of seaweed and were running for their lives.

The net that had once held Whale to the seabed suddenly fell from above, trapping the pirates like angry wasps. And there was Eel and all her helpers making sure the net was securely in place. Whale: "Well done, ladies. A first-class job." "It's Whale!" "Come now, my friends, and climb aboard!" Story Teller: Whale was so busy making sure the net around the Sea Witch was good and tight that he didn't see Davy Jones making his escape. Napoleon addressed the pirates. "In the name of Her Majesty, Queen of Night, I order you to sail the seven seas for seven friendless years." ( moaning ) "Wow, what if they get lonely?" Story Teller: Scarecrow remembered very well what it was like to be friendless. ( moaning ) "And if you get lonely and are really sorry for all your wrongdoings, then you'll be given a very nice job looking after the canoes on the Royal Boating Pond. And the Admiral here will take charge of your fine ship the Sea Witch... ( echoing ) witch, witch, witch..." "If you'd like to go below, sir, I think you'll find someone waiting for you." "Who is it?" "I think I can guess." Story Teller: The Admirals were so pleased to see each other that they couldn't say a word and just hugged all the way home. "Would you come and see me someday? I've plenty of room." "Lor' love you, of course we will. We were just saying how much we miss our holidays up there. It gets so wet on the seabed in winter." Story Teller: Before parting, the Admiral gave Mumfie and Scarecrow each a present as a token of his gratitude. "Now we really must be going. We still have very important work to do on Pinkey's island." Story Teller: And with a last goodbye, Whale sped back up towards the surface. "I feel the Secretary must know we have the Queen's jewel. His anger will soon destroy everything in his sight, including the island. Her Majesty is in great danger." "We must get the Queen's jewel back to her." "I'd better carry Pinkey to the island. She's done more than enough flying on her own for one day." "There's not enough room for all of us on your back, Napoleon. We'll have to use the Queen's umbrella and hope its magic works again." Story Teller: And it did! Secretary: "Someone must be punished for all this carelessness." ( whimpers ) "Useless fools! I shall find the little elephant myself. He must be destroyed, and then the jewel will be mine." ( whines ) No! Story Teller: The cat knew that she must do whatever she could to save Mumfie. They flew over mountains and forests. Secretary: "There they are!" The umbrella was flying lower and lower. "Jump! My magic will keep you safe. Jump, and your bravery will be rewarded." Story Teller: Mumfie looked at the cat for a moment and suddenly felt strangely comforted. So he jumped! "Mumfie!" ( grunts ) When Mumfie recovered, he saw that he was sitting in a dewy meadow. He picked himself up and turned to see a familiar figure. It was Davy Jones, the pirate captain, and he was washing the tattoos off his arms. ( gasps ) "They're not real tattoos." "Aw, that's 'cause I was never a real pirate. I just got the lads together 'cause I was lonely. And when I was lonely, I was bored. And when I was bored, I got up to mischief." "That's no excuse. There's a lot of other things you could have done." "Not when you haven't got much imagination, there isn't." "Everyone has imagination. You just have to know how to use it." Mumfie: "Well, what are you imagining?" Davy Jones: "I'm back at sea with the waves rolling under the deck and the stars dancing overhead. But who'd ever trust or hire me to go sailing again with my reputation?" "I would," cried Mumfie. And handed Davy Jones the penny he'd been carrying in his pocket since ever he left home. "Take this lucky penny and report for duty immediately." "What's the job and what's the boat?" "Deck steward on board the good ship Whale." "The same whale what we trussed up like a sea chicken? He'll never forgive me for that." "Whale has got an awfully big heart. Why don't you go and ask him?" Story Teller: Davy Jones tossed the penny in the air. Davy Jones: "Heads, I does, tails, I doesn't. I does!" "The sea is in that direction." "I know. I can smell it." Cat: I daresay you could do with some company yourself. ( meows ) "What do you want now?" "I'm here to help. I've been trying to do that since we met." ( meows ) "I'm afraid the Secretary caught Napoleon, but your friends Scarecrow and Pinkey escaped. They're hidden in the palace. Come on, I'll take you back there." ( meows ) ( wind whistling ) Story Teller: A huge gust of wind blew the cat high into the air. "And don't dawdle." "It's way past my tea time." "I wish we could hurry up and find Scarecrow." "Well... if it isn't the horrible little elephant. You're just in time. The Secretary wants to meet you." ( rapping ) "Give me the Queen's jewel, quickly." ( meows ) Story Teller: Reluctantly, Mumfie did so. "Ah... the little elephant. Where is the jewel?" "It must be awful tiring being so angry all the time." "What?" "Don't you ever smile?" "Name?" "Yes." "What do you mean, 'yes'?" "Yes, I've got one." "Then what is it?" "Mumfie." "Occupation?" "Elephant," said Mumfie, not knowing what "occupation" meant. "Don't you mean 'spy'?" - "No." - "Liar." "I don't tell lies, and anyone who says I do is a liar himself." "Take him to the holding cell and give him no food or water till he tells us where the jewel is. That'll make him change his tune." "I know lots of tunes." Story Teller: And Mumfie started to whistle a particularly cheery one. ( whistling ) The Secretary took hold of Mumfie's trunk and squeezed, but elephants don't whistle through their trunks. So Mumfie was able to go on whistling even though his eyes were watering. The hours passed and Mumfie grew colder and colder. - ( sighs ) - ( door opening ) ( gasps ) Someone tall and thin with sticking-out hairs stood in the doorway. "Scarecrow!" Story Teller: Before they could say any more, Pinkey flew around the corner. "Quickly! I found Napoleon! This way!" Mumfie and Scarecrow followed Pinkey as she flew up the winding staircase of the Queen's palace. ( sniffing ) "Napoleon's in there." ( door creaking ) Story Teller: But Napoleon was nowhere to be seen. ( sniffing ) "Shh! There's somebody coming." Story Teller: Mumfie was already trying to push over one of the cabinets to block the door. ( groans ) "I say, when you decide to rescue someone, you don't waste any time, do you?" ( grunts ) "There's no way to open this window." "Then we'll just have to break the glass." ( grunts ) Story Teller: Scarecrow picked up a heavy paperweight and put it in his hat. "Everyone, stand back." ( glass breaking ) "Look, there's something in the paperweight." Story Teller: Scarecrow lifted out a small silver thimble. "And what's inside this thimble? It's swirling and very mysterious." ( gasps ) "It's the Queen of Night's magic cloak! You found it." ( grunting ) "That's an awfully long jump, and Napoleon will never be able to carry us all." "Don't worry, I can look after myself." "And I think I can come up to size." ( grunts ) ( yells, grunts ) "This is even better than skating." ( gasps ) Mumfie: "The Secretary's following us." Secretary: "Give it back!" "We've got to take evasive action. Hang on tight!" "Ooh!" Story Teller: In the muffled silence, they heard the swish of the Secretary's cloak. At last, Napoleon felt it was safe to start moving again. The Secretary was nowhere to be seen, but neither was Pinkey. Mumfie: "I hope she's all right." "I recognize this place. It's the Queen of Night's garden." "A fortunate piece of navigation. You find Her Majesty. I'll search for Pinkey." "She looks so sad." "We think this thimble may hold your magic Cloak of Dreams, Your Majesty." Secretary: "Indeed, it does." "It's Pinkey!" "What?" ( gasps ) Story Teller: The cloak rose out of the thimble in a cloud of sparkling mist full of wonderful colors and shapes. It wrapped itself around the Secretary like a snake until he was completely out of sight. The Queen held out the thimble again, and there, in place of the Secretary, was a large empty stone inkwell. "Gosh, that really is a magic cloak." "And thank you for its return." "Now... will you set my mother free, please?" "Free them all." Story Teller: Again, the Cloak of Dreams flew into the air, swirling into a great cloud that sped off towards the dungeons. ( clicks, creaking ) "Mama!" ( popping ) Story Teller: Next day, when laughter and music had returned to the island, the Queen held a special party in her garden. "Look out, Your Majesty." "It's all right. I've seen the error of my ways. The only orders I'll follow now are Her Majesty's. Shall I do the honors now, Your Majesty?" "Please. You have been trusting, kind and courageous. And you have brought peace and happiness back to this island." "I'm still very sorry I lost your jewel, Your Majesty." "Mumfie, why don't you look in your pocket?" ( gasps ) "You may keep it, Mumfie." "But it's a treasure beyond price!" "So it is, for those who receive it. You should get ready to go home now, Mumfie." Scarecrow: "There's Whale, but who's that with him?" ( chuckles ) "I know who it is." - "Ahoy!" - "It's Davy Jones, and he's polishing the portholes as bright as a new penny. Whale is making his wish come true." "Will you keep me company always, Scarecrow? We can have lots more adventures." "As long as I can visit my field sometime." "Of course you can! But I shall miss everyone, won't you?
