No, I did not imagine my father would die the following morning. Jean, did you get the beer? Yes, Mother. - Did you remember the bread? - Yes. Put that in the sink. You took your time doing the shopping. I went for a walk. I didn't see Fatima. I'll go this afternoon. My sheep. My sheep. Father is dreaming about the farm again. I'll wake him now. Is that you, my son? Hey, Father! Look at me! Hey, Father! Hey, Father! Look! I'm not holding the handlebar. You need building up, my son. Oh, this is awful! Both legs are broken. We'll have to take you to hospital. I hope you didn't damage your head! Go on, get out of here! Ali, take the sack two rows further. Put it down gently. Don't tear it. Let's give you a wash. You seem a little better. I had left Algeria a few years beforehand. I was working in France. That was where my work, my friends, my daily routine was. All was going well. My wife and son were on holiday near Angouleme as usual. My life had begun to settle down. Without my parents, Algeria would have meant nothing to me. The grapes must be ripe by now with this heat. They must have started harvesting. I had come to Algiers because my father was ill. I would have liked my parents to come and live in France. They had the same concerns, the same worries as ever. My father had never been a good business man. He'd had to sell his farm over 15 years earlier. ♪ The king's daughter was at the window ♪ ♪ The king's daughter was at the window ♪ ♪ Rat-a-tat-tat. ♪ What is it, Mother? Nothing. Can't I look at you? I forgot to say... I had a letter from your son. Where did I...? Ah, here it is. He says he's enjoying his holidays in Angouleme and he did me a drawing, of an animal, I think. It arrived this morning. It's a story I tell him to send him to sleep. A flock of sheep pass a car in the night. A sheep looks into the car's headlights, thinking it's the sun. Father told me this story when I was little. Do you still have problems with your eyes? A bit. While you're here, go and see my specialist. I've seen one in Paris. I wear spectacles when my eyes hurt. Did you see Fatima this morning? Oh, you already told me. Yes. Don't worry, Mother. I'll go and see her this afternoon. I used my trip to the shops to walk around the city. I'd only been there two days and already felt stifled. I was keen for my father to recover so I could return to France. Don't go out tomorrow unless you have to. - Why? - It's Ashura. - How much is that? - 300 francs. - Till tomorrow. - Who knows? Good morning. - A large loaf, please. - I've only got baguettes. That's fine, one baguette. We're closing early this evening. - It's Ashura tomorrow. - It's Ashura. Will that be all? Yes, thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. No, I had no inkling. It was the day before Ashura. The papers said it was an important day for Muslims. They also reported hundreds of vines had been cut down in the night near Algiers. I walked through the streets, just as I would do on Thursdays when I used to go to school. Very little had changed in this part of town. It felt as though I was on holiday. I was planning to go to the beach. What did he say? - That they're armed. - It's not the same. Go on, move them along. Move along, move along. There's nothing to see. I live opposite. What did he say? - They're armed. - It's not the same. Go on, move back. Go on, move back, please. A bomb in a basket. We've defused it. Just in time. Well now, it's Ashura tomorrow. Mother, get me some peanuts. If you're good. Bye. Hi, Brahim. You okay? Hello. Hi. Hello. Bye, Mother! Hey! Boralfa! Saïd! Boralfa! Saïd! Hello. Hey, clear off! - Afraid of pebbles? - You're jealous. Peace be with you, Embarek. And peace be with you, my child. Why are you lighting candles? It's hot. It's Ashura tomorrow. It's the start of the year. The start of the year? That's after Christmas, isn't it? It's the feast day of the poor, the deprived and orphans. All families make a pilgrimage to the graves. We have to call on God to make the land fertile... with wheat, olives, cucumbers, garlic and onions. What is the point in them cutting down the vines? I'm not surprised they're rebelling. Nobody talks to them anymore. Give me your hand, Father. You had a bad night's sleep. Get some rest now. You must sleep. - It's too hot, Father. - I want you to take a siesta. I don't want to, Father. You must sleep. Father. - I want you to sleep. - Father. Sleep. I want you to sleep. Sleep. Sleep well. And don't have any bad dreams. Sleep. Sleep well. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. My father's farm stretched out in the middle of the plain. About 20 Arab families lived there. We grew vines, wheat, oranges. My father had built a house where I spent my childhood. Hey, fellows! Hey, fellows! I've got the helmet! Come on. Onwards! Ready? Let's go! Jean, hurry up. Come on, hurry up! There we are! Jean. Jean. Let me piss in peace! That's it! Hurray! Saïd has won! We won! Onwards! I had always been told there had once been only marshes and bushes there... where jackals and hyenas roamed. People used to die of malaria. He had cleared and improved the land, planted trees and vines. It was his work. Wait for me. I'll be back. Stop! Where did you learn to work? That's not how I told you to do it. Underneath! That's what I was doing, I swear. Look how you did it. There, there and there. That's useless. Do it all again. All of it! And hurry if you want to get paid! We need five or six more men here. At this pace, we won't finish in time. Not here! Keep away! This is a holy man's grave! It's not me, the boss told me to do it here! Don't bother me with these marabouts. There are marabouts all over the farm. I'll get rid of them. Know what I'm going to do? I can't work the land for them. I'm going to blow up your marabouts. Go on, off you go. Fear Allah's wrath, Mr. Michel! Fear the fire of his vengeance! I'm the boss here, aren't I? Giddy up! Embarek, get out of the way. Out of the way, I said. Giddy up! Embarek took care of the marabouts. They are the graves of the holy who were buried there. There were some near the stable, behind the house, in among the vines. No sign of disease. With the sunshine we've had, if we get a little rain, it will get this big. You'll see the harvest. And little by little, the land became fertile. This is Paris. Radio Paris. We announce the exact time. 4pm, 59 minutes and 40 seconds. At the fourth beep, it will be 5 pm precisely, 0 minutes. It's five o'clock. 5pm, 0 minutes, 10 seconds. 5pm, 0 minutes, 20 seconds. It was very hot in the streets. On the farm, during this heat, they were harvesting the grapes. Fatima! Come here, Fatima. She's coming. Don't you remember me? You always said I forgot everything. "It goes in one side and comes out the other." Ah! Mr. Jean! I was... afraid. And why did you come today? You think of Fatima? Mother thought you were ill. You didn't come to help in the house. Come in. Come in and see us. Go on in. Mr. Jean. Mr. Jean. Your son, is he in France? Yes. I left my son in France. You see? How is it with Saïd? Oh! And then... You take there, you put there. You take sugar. Comes in and goes out. Bad, you know... - I would have liked to see Saïd. - He's gone. - Where to? - There. I don't know. And why, Mr. Jean? Why? When you are old, you wait. You wait for God. It looks like rain. That's a good sign. If it rains any more tonight, the sirocco will be over. Don't talk too much, Father. Rest. It would be better if it doesn't rain. With the sirocco all the grapes must be ripe. If there's a storm, they'll rot on the vine. It's not going to rain. Father had just seen it rain for the last time. It's nice of you to visit. I should have come sooner, but with the troubles... - How is our patient? - This heat is tiring him. Have you seen the paper? They've cut down the vines. It happened just 2 kilometers away from me. There are army trucks everywhere, and the police are at the ready. They'll be here next. Where's Jean? Jean, cousin Louise is here. Jean, come here. Come and say hello to cousin Louise. Oh, what fine gloves! Father brought them back from Paris. I have a son who wants to be a boxer. The minute he's clean, he rolls about on the ground. Boralfa, go and play. Jean's staying here. - Is he good at school? - Not brilliant. Jean, you have to work if you want to take over the farm. It's a man's work. I have to battle every day. It's not much fun as a woman. Didn't you meet anyone in Paris on your travels? An Algerian woman with a farm, vineyards and a car, they should come running. A Parisian in Algeria? On a farm, in charge of Arabs? He'd be had the whole time. They'd have a field day. - You need a great lover. - Not at all! That's not for me. I have too much to do. I'm used to managing this property alone. I won't be taken for a ride. Not like Michel. I'm nobody's fool. That's what I tell him. He only trusts people who ask him for money. You'll never change your Michel. It's his life. He's only ever happy when he's dreaming up something. It's his life, but it's yours too. He should be more careful. He gets drawn into things by untrustworthy people. Wait till you see what he got in Paris! We're now installing central heating. What on earth for? We'll die of the heat! No, Michel! Stop it. Louise, don't be so vain. Michel, you don't know what it is to be afraid. Something to drink, Louise? No thanks. If you were on a farm... Michel, get ready for your injections. Anyone would think you enjoy that. Wait till they take to the streets brandishing axes. Then you'll see. You think something is going to happen? She's always been a doom monger. She was like that about the farm. If you had listened to me, you'd still have your farm. I don't mean to criticize, but you have to see things as they are. If we shot 10 of them after each attack... - I can't listen to this! - You know what it's like on a farm! Force alone counts here. Their religion says so. - They'll drive us out. - You don't understand them. What about your Saïd who made me take on more workers. He's in the mountains, too. Saïd? Fatima's son? Saïd. Jean and Boralfa's playmate. He's now slitting throats like the others. Jean, do you ever see Boralfa? I intend to. He'll be at his garage. Please ask him to come and prune my trees. He was due to come a fortnight ago. Michel, roll up your sleeve. I'd like to see Boralfa. He may have left with the others. Ouch! You're hurting me. Oh, you! You can't imagine what it's like returning to the farm alone, barricading yourself in each night, dragging the wardrobe in front of the window and waiting. It's no life. You should see my farm, with all the barbed wire, surrounded by soldiers. Your farm, too, Michel. The Arabs ask me every day what they should do. "Why is nothing being done?" "What will become of us if you go?" They all say that. They want me to stay. I inherited this farm from my father. It's my entire life. I sacrificed everything for it. It's my country. I won't leave it. They can kill me, but I won't leave. You should make arrangements with your mother. I don't know what he will leave to you. Poor Michel. He's not the man he was. If only you'd known him when he was young. Mark out the track. Jean. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Saïd, hand me the stake. There's water there. We must have found water this time. That's it, it's coming. What did I tell you, Embarek? It's good to find water, Mr. Michel. May God protect you. Yes, this is where Boralfa works. Don't you remember me, Mr. Jean? I lived at your father's farm. Just before he sold it. Don't you recognize me? Idir. We were in the infantry. With Boralfa, we met you in Alsace during the war, near Mulhouse. There was snow, this high. Boralfa has gone back to the village to see his wife. We're fine here, it's quiet. Sit yourself down. Boralfa and me, we sleep here. Aren't you married? I am. I have a wife and three kids. Two boys and a girl. Like Boralfa, I've left them in the village with my parents. I visit now and then when I can. My goodness! It was so cold in Alsace, during the war. Rain, snow. It was like living in lemonade. Boralfa was really annoying. He used to talk about the sun all the time, the fig trees and all. What we would have given to go back to the farm! It was the same for us. But, anyway, we're fine here. Saïd sometimes came to see me when he was at your cousin's. How is Boralfa? Boralfa's fine. He often talks about you. It was him who found me this job. I earn a good wage, I have social security. Like a European, you know. - Hello. - Madam. Sorry to disturb you. I've come for my car. My husband brought it in for lubrication. Talk to the mechanic over there, he'll be able to help you. I'll tell him. - Ali! - Yes? Help the lady. This one with the dog! You can go ahead, madam. It's done. Thank you. You're very kind. Saïd would have liked a job like this. Boralfa will tell you: "It's better here than on the farm." Nothing to fear, Boralfa, it's 14th July. Boralfa wasn't there, Father. He's due back tomorrow. Louise doesn't really know what a farm is. She's brave for a woman, and she manages her affairs. She's a spinster. She should have had her bottom pinched more often. Oh, Michel! It was her father who set up her farm. And I made him plant the vines. It's only now she's taking care of it. She can barely say "hello" in Arabic. But she speaks English. "She speaks English." Hear that? She speaks English. And does Jean speak Latin? There's no talking to you! Can you still speak Arabic? A bit. There's not much opportunity in France. When Boralfa comes, we'll speak Arabic. If you don't speak it, you can't understand them. I was with them all day long. We argued at times, of course. Especially with Embarek. He thought he was the prophet. He put his damn marabouts everywhere. He had the last laugh when he died. Another marabout. When anyone was ill, I was always asked to give the injection. I did it for all the Moorish women on the farm. Afterwards, they gave us cakes. We argued, but we knew one another. It was like a big family. Everyone knew their place. I taught them how to prune and graft the trees. When I bought my farm there was nothing there. We had to clear everything, to plant and work the land. People used to die of malaria. I was one of the first to plant vines. Everyone thought I was mad, especially Louise. And then, everyone followed suit. We earned a lot of money. Then people in Algiers involved me in some bad business deals. That's why I lost the farm. You were always too trusting. The Arabs taught me to be fair. If you are fair, they will never forget you. At that time it was hard to know what you should do. I have no regrets. I did what I had to do. Everything I did was fair. Who will teach you about Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Power? This night is worth more than a thousand months. On this night the angels of the spirit come down to earth... to settle things. This night if full of peace till dawn. Are you sure about sleeping outside? Yes, I'll be cooler. You can turn off the light. Jean, what's that? Is it gunfire? It's nothing. Don't worry. - Is it raining? - No, Father. My father's story had involved love and hate. Now there was only hate. Father... When did we sell the farm? Jean, come back here! Jean! Oh, oh! Move, move. Move, move, move. Jean! Jean! Jean! Jean! Jean! Your father has stopped breathing. Mother... All the shops were shut. It was Ashura. In Algeria, it's a public holiday for everyone. He was my father. All his life, he had got up early. On the farm, to go to the vineyard or into the cellar, he would flank the orangery and come to the stable where the horses were harnessed, and after walking along the avenue of cypress trees, he would go past Embarek's marabout at the foot of the olive tree. Once he had sold the farm, he would walk through the city streets at dawn, stopping to talk to the Arabs in the neighbourhood. It was the first time that he hurt me. I was his son. Yes, Father is dead. He died in his sleep. This morning, around five o'clock. He didn't suffer. I've registered his death at the city hall. Goodbye. Thank you. It's Jean. He had to go into the city. Here. Put that in the sink. Boralfa brought figs from the farm for father. Let's prepare the bedroom. Who is coming? I'm sorry, Mr. Jean. Mr. Michel is dead. - Louise has gone to the village. - Who's that? Saïd's son. Boralfa will take care of him. Boralfa will help us. Here, put these in the bathroom. Jean, pass me the duster. You need a black tie. The shops are shut. You must have an old one. We'll have a look. Help me pull the bed out. We'll put chairs around it. Mother, come back to France with me. Here, pull. He seems to be smiling. It happened last night. At the end of the road. The press said it was a settling of scores. There's no doubt. I met a general from there the other evening. He said that... since independence all the French have to leave. Does he still have his farm? - My condolences. - He sold it. It's all done to make their life hard. Their money is blocked. Michel knew him well. They were at school together. I think we should leave. Wait a little, we can't be at the church tomorrow. We buried him very quickly, because of the heat. Louise took care of all the arrangements. Jean, come. I'll introduce you to Mathilde. Mathilde. This is Jean, Michel's son. I know him, I saw him when he was little. - This is my husband. - My condolences. Poor Michel. He was always so active. He died in his sleep, he didn't suffer. I felt that father no longer belonged to us. Aunt Françoise. Mother couldn't come. She'll be at the church tomorrow. Jean. Do you still have your farm? We've got someone to manage it, we live in the city. Nothing against them. But we no longer show our strength. Your father knew that. If after every attack, 10 were executed. Sadly, force is the only thing they understand. What are you doing with that cloth? I don't want to see you cleaning! Mr. Michel! Mr. Michel! Mr. Michel! They're coming down from the mountain. - They can't find work. - I've already given them bread. They're not part of the farm, they're not my concern. Go away! There's no work here. I told you, there's no work. I'll send this mob packing. I'm used to it. Come closer, and I'll knock him out. Go on, clear off. And if I live in France, I earn good money. I work, I get money for the kids. When you have no work, you don't know what to do. It depends, some people walk. It depends what they do. Some fellows don't see their families for two years. You know, they go mad. But I don't understand it. When we walk down the street, the French give us dirty looks. But we fought together in the war. We crossed the Rhine. We were the second to cross the Rhine. My father was a sergeant. So was I. My cousin was a lieutenant. He is still in the army. But I wanted to come back to my country. When I came back, it was the same thing here. People give us dirty looks. That's why Saïd left. He works for your cousin. He had an argument with your cousin Louise. He's a tractor driver, but he's paid like a fisherman. That wasn't right. Then, your cousin Louise, as you well know, she came to my garage. When she came to the garage, I knew she would try it on, because she's always trying it on. I said to my mates, "She wants something." She came in and said, "Hello, Boralfa. How are you?" I said, "Yes, madam. I'm fine, I'm very well. "What can I do for you?" She said, "Come and prune my trees." I said, "All right." I went and pruned her trees. I worked for three days. When I finished, she paid me, she gave me 600 francs. I thought about it. And then I said, "No, that's a disgrace." She has no shame. I don't respect her. She didn't even pay me for the truck. So I took the 600 francs and I said, "How much would you have given a French man, madam? "You pay him 2,000 francs a day. That's 6,000 francs for three days. "You gave me 600 francs, that's not the price." All the same. I'm an Arab, a boudjadi. So I went to your father. I said, "Look what Louise gave me." He said, "How much?" I told him, "600 francs." He said, "Just keep them. "We'll sort something out with her next year." I kept the 600 francs and left. She came again the next year. She said, "Come and prune my trees again." When I got to the farm, before I saw her, I went to see your father who said, "Remember last year? "She gave you 600 francs for three days?" I said, "Yes." He had shown me how to prune the vines, how to prune trees, plant, graft, all that. Your father knew all that. He taught me everything. He said, "This is what you'll do now: "Cut off the good branches. "That way, she'll remember you. "Don't cut the bad branches. She's a boudjadi, not you." That's why Saïd left. He left his kids behind. We're not in the vineyards. All these people... Why do they rebel? Because we have no country. The reason I didn't leave... was because of your father. I'm not interested in that any more. I left Algeria to get away from all this. You know what your father said to me? He wanted you to stay here. What would I do here? Do what Louise does? At least in France, I don't have these problems. I'm bored. I'm not interested. But I don't have these problems. All his life, my father tried to make something of the land. He created a farm from nothing. He found water, he planted trees. In France, whenever I see an olive tree or vines, I think of that. He was sure he had done something good for this country. And now, it's as if he had done nothing. I'd also have liked to do something here. But you see what happened to my father. So you lose courage. Now you and Saïd want to create a different country. How can I trust you? I don't want to have to kowtow to anyone just because they're Arab. I don't want to live in fear. And then have to pack my bags and leave. My family, my own country. Like a foreigner. I want to be among the vines here too. A country should be for everyone. Otherwise there's no justice. No country. Nothing. Like before. You have reason to hope. But I have no faith. People will kill each other every day now. Once that starts, everyone will hate each other. All co-operation will be lost. That's why I'm not staying. You can't be proud of what's happening. So you're here and I'm there. Over there, at least my son will be happy. And I will forget. We can do nothing more together. Your father and I think you'll come back. My father is dead. Before I left, someone said we had to write an announcement for the papers. We wrote something standard: "He was one of the early settlers "who, through their efforts, have made the vast plain fertile. "One of the last members of that generation passes away. "He was one of the first to plant the vines, "which were to become Algeria's main riches." Despite the conventional wording, it was true. It was a good summary of his life. I couldn't even console myself with hate, for I had none. He died in his sleep. But he'd seemed much better. He kept talking about the farm on the last evening, remember? If it hadn't been so hot, if there'd been some rain... - Are you going to the village? - Yes. Don't pick anyone up There's just been an attack. Drive on. I was simply going to bury my father. Then it would all be over. Throw the ball back. Quick! - Quick! - Throw it back! Throw the ball back! Come on! Thanks. - Shoot! - To me! To me! Michel. Embarek? "May his soul, and the souls of all the departed, "faithful by God's mercy, rest in peace." Amen. My sincere condolences. You should know your father was a trailblazer, a builder, a pioneer. He will be in our hearts forever. Thank you. - Madam. - Thank you. You've seen the situation we're in, Jean? You'll be much happier in France. I knew your father well, you know. We didn't always see eye to eye politically, but he was a decent man. There may not be a statue to him, but the vines and plants will be a testament to him. Thank you. I'll have the roses sent to the farm. Don't be late back. - Of course. - It's wiser. Poor Michel. At least he knew the good times. I've come to say goodbye. I leave the day after tomorrow. Mr. Jean, I came because of your father. - Take him to the doctor. - Spread out the papers. On the farm, Embarek would often say, "Up there in Paradise, there will be a huge fig tree, "in whose shade the servants of God "will drink a water that is limpid and fresh. "One of them will say, " 'I had a friend on Earth. " 'It had become my country.' "
