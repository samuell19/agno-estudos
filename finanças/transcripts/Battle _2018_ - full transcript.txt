NETFLIX PRESENTS And... That's good, Charlotte. Thank you. Out on the floor, and spread out. All right. Ida, what was your grade on the latest math test? An A. A? - It doesn't really help you here, does it? - No. Vanessa. With your butt, maybe you should try pole dancing instead? Amalie... Amalie... Two things are required of you. 1: Know your steps. 2: Put yourselves on display in your dance. Come across. To us, who sit here watching you. But when I look at you, Amalie... I see nothing. You don't communicate anything. It's like you're completely empty. - But I thought I did everything correctly. - Correctly? What's that? Correctly... Ida, if you can't take criticism, you shouldn't be here. Her cat is dead. - What are you saying? - That's why she is sad. Her cat is dead? I see. Thanks. Charlotte. Good. At least you were technically superior. But... Until tomorrow, think of what I said. That was all for today. Hope she gets laid soon and gets rid of some of her frustration. Bitch. She's not a bitch towards Charlotte. We're trying to find the perfect mix between comfort and speed. You can chill, have a beer, go swimming... - And then pop up fast when needed. - Right. That'll be cool. Hi. - How was class? - Really good. - Did you have a good time? - Yes. - Did you have fun? - Yes. Anyone for swimming? No! Stop! Knock it off! - Cold, Vanessa? - Yes. - Who's that? - No idea. Good morning, everybody. Bashir was my student... For a long time, Bashir and I have wanted to collaborate. And now Bashir has reserved a place for one of you, who may attend his school for a whole year. Quiet! I saw an opera performance, and a lot of people from that school were in it. It's insane! May we practice at your place, Charlotte? Hello! Everything okay? Come in. Good morning. - Good morning. Up early? - Going to the Netherlands, you know. That's great, little warrior. Charlotte has got herself a dance gym. In the basement. That's why she's so good. We don't use the basement for anything. Maybe we should get ourselves a dance gym? Maybe you could talk to our carpenter? Think about it, Dad. Bye! Shit... Is this what you mean? Like this? - I challenge you to do butterfly. - You know how to do butterfly? You're so incredibly lucky to have all this. Yes, new money can also be a good thing. If she didn't have the pool, we wouldn't have the most awesome parties. Right, we have to start planning the party. Got to top last year’s party. Let's start the pre-party right now. - Here you are. - No, thanks, not while I'm training. Me neither. I can drink the whole bottle if it's such a big deal. There's already a glass for me. Hi! I have to ask you to leave. I'm really sorry. - What? But we just got here. - My fault. I should have told you. I’m expecting some people, you see. - We'll continue the party at my place. - Is it okay? Super. - No problem. - That's great. Just help yourselves from the cellar. Amalie. It would be good if you’d stay behind. - Why? - I'll tell you later. - Enjoy yourselves, folks! - Bye. See you later, Bjørn. - You'll come around later? - Yes. I'll call you. - Got everything? The bottles? - Of course! You've got to tell me if you're expecting guests. It's so embarrassing to throw my friends out! Did you talk to the carpenter? About the dance gym? Hello? There's a lot of people outside. What's happening? Yes...? It's... Hi. We're from the Enforcement Office. Do you know why we're here? Yes. But there's no need for this. I'm getting a loan and will settle with the creditors. You have had every opportunity to do so. Now it's too late. Either you let us in or we ask for assistance from the police. Here you are. - What's happening? - Just relax. - Hi. Do you live here? - Yes. This property will be abandoned. Show me your room so we can pack. Dad? Bring all personal belongings. All sensitive information. Toilet articles, things you need... You may enter now. - How long will we be gone? - This house will be sold. - Is it possible to speed it up? - Pack your things. Two jackets should be enough. - But this is my sailing jacket. - Two jackets. An official receiver will decide what can be sold. - My things will be sold? - The official receiver will decide. - Telephone, PC, passport... - Passport? Everything containing personal information. It's nothing dramatic. It's just a situation has come up... Do a final check upstairs. Excuse me! - Just a moment. - No. Start packing. - I'll just finish this conversation. - No. Now. All sensitive information. Toilet articles. Things you need. Now. SEALED Can't we just check in to a hotel? Dad... Bloody hell. God damn it. There's only one bed. Well, I can sleep here. But... Damn, this place... Hello? This is Bjørn Viksjø. I've arrived at the apartment you've given us. There must be some mistake. We live in Norway. Not some bloody developing country. Okay, I see. All right. Thank you. Dad. What's going on? Foreclosure? Amalie, I've got a... I've got a little liquidity problem, so I'm short of cash. - But what happened? - Well... They bankrupted me. Bankrupt? But don't you have a lot of shares you can sell? No. I actually sold them a long time ago. It was this apartment project at Geilo. I thought I shoould manage, but... They will set up a debt management plan. - Debt management plan? - Yes. The authorities will take control for a period. - For how long? - Five years. Five years?! Are we going to live here for five years? Of course it won't be five years. I'll take care of this. I'll just get a new loan, and then we’ll move back. This will work out fine. Don't worry. Where will I have dancing space? How about here in the living room? We don't need more furniture. It's a stone floor. I can't dance here. I'm sorry, Amalie. READY? SORRY... HAVE TO HELP DAD WITH THE GUESTS. Yes, this is kind of awkward. That's why I'm calling. I helped you out of the gutter a few times. IDA: WHERE WERE YOU? SHE WENT THROUGH ALL THE SEQUENCES. Ill. IDA: CHARLOTTE IS HALFWAY TO THE NETHERLANDS... - You're going to school today? - Yes. Have you talked to your friends about... this? Are you out of your mind? Good. Inhale deeply with every breath. It makes your movements deeper. Does anyone want to show us yesterday's sequence? Sorry. The bus was late. How kind of you to show up. I really appreciate it. Thank you. And just in time to show us the sequence. Come on. We're waiting. - Sorry. I didn't get to warm up properly. - I think you look pretty warm. - I'll do it again. - No. We don't want to see you rehearse what you should have practiced at home. Charlotte, come. Yes. That's it. See how lightly she flows. She's flying. I've been negotiating this so much that I can brief you. No problem. Because those people are a bit... They're inspired by Russian tactics. They don't say anything. Just that... INDIVIDUAL TRAINING YOUTH CENTER YOUTH CENTER Hi. - Hi. What's up? - I just wondered... Is it okay if I practice here? Well, that's what it's meant for. Just come in. Shit! You know... Whenever I get stuck, I just do something different. - Would you like to? - Yes. All right. Introduction course to hip hop. First you'll need shoes. Okay. The first move is Steve Martin. Turn, rocker. Three, four... Five, six. Bart Simpson. Then you slide. Back. One, two, three, four. Then three quick ones. Running man. Down. Yes. And continue. And one, and two... Hello... No? Sorry. I know there are names and things... You know what? Let's just dance. Shuffles! 1, 2, 3... Nice! - Where did you learn to dance? - I attend Valkyrien. Modern. - And you're ready for something more? - Maybe. Yo, guys! What's up? - Hello. - Hi. - Moa. - Amalie. - Nice. - Mikael! Hi. What's up? - Hi. I'm Kim. - Amalie. - Will you join our training? - No. I have to go. Okay. - Mikael, come here. - Nice eardrops. What kind of music do you want? So, what are you up to tomorrow? Nothing? No? Awesome. Because I thought you could join us for something. Okay? Like what? Nyland at eight o'clock. At The World. Be there. - What happens there? - You'll see tomorrow. Be there. Just come. Hey, you... Girl. What was your name again? Amalie. You know there's a door there? - You know, open, exit. - Yes. I just... Beginners’ course or what? Don't take his course. Mikael is shit. Follow my course. Magic Moa. - I have to go now. - Okay. Bye. See you. Don't take a course with any of them. Did you hook up or what? That's all for today. Hi, you have reached Amalie. Leave a message. Talk to you later! Hello? Where are you? I've been looking everywhere. I've called Ida. I'm outside your house. Call me back. AKSEL: HELLO...? WEREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO MEET? Hey! Cool that you came here! - What's happening? - This, Amalie, is a battle. - That's it? - "That's it"? You realize that this is not choreographed? It's freestyle, Amalie. - Freestyle? - Yes! They didn't even know the tune. They don't know who they'll meet or when they'll meet them. You just enter the stage when you're called. And then you just live out a moment. Speaking of a moment... Watch this. She kills it. It's insane. Say hello to the rest of the crew. Come. Moa, remember Amalie? Who do you think will win? They're voting now. The ladies...? Bergen knows her stuff! Marlenita and Mariken go on to the finals! Are you ready for All-Star Battle, 1 versus 1? You know, we're a crew, and we're friends. But when we battle, we get all the shit out, you know. Provoke each other. Some people may get angry. Like, last week, someone got shot. What? Seriously? Hello? - Fuck you. - You're easily fooled! People! Groruddalen, make some noise! Show some love for the dancers, Moa and Alex from the Illicit crew! Are you with me, folks? One, two, three... - Moa and Alex, from the Illicit crew! - What does that mean? That means there's a draw. Altogether one vote more for Moa. - Will you battle? - I'm here to see someone else battle. Who? No... - I promise, you'll do great! - I can't! You'll be so good! This is the coolest thing in the world! Don't stress. Just be yourself. Be honest about it, right? Take this off. It will get hot. - He's damn good. - He's just a kid. Ten seconds, Jojo. Jojo, folks! Come on, Amalie. Okay, okay. - I can't do this. - You're doing great. That's bite! What are you doing? - Bite! Bite! - That's my move! Bite, Amalie! It's all right. Don't mind them. Amalie? Amalie! Amalie! Stop! - Why did you do that? - I thought you'd like it. How could you think someone would enjoy this? - I made a total fool of myself! - I know, but... It's supposed to be fun, okay? Not for me. Fuck. AKSEL CALL ME - Hi. - Okay, so you didn't smash your phone? - I won't be like that again. Okay? - I waited so long. I sent thousands of messages. It's really bad behavior. Aksel, I... Sorry that I've been shit. Sorry. There'll be nice weather tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. Hello. I guess I overslept. - Going out? - I'll go sailing. Will you do some decent shopping soon? Sure. - Bring your sailing jacket. It's cold. - I don't have a sailing jacket! They took everything! Dad, stop lying to everyone! You're creating your own world. Listen, the audition... I'm really nervous. Like, doomsday over the whole audition day. Just hold a steady course and watch out for the boat over there. Amalie, you must be freezing your ass off. No, I'm good. - No jacket? - You need a jacket. - I forgot it at home. - Mom's got one. Let's go find it. MIKAEL SENT YOU A FRIEND REQUEST MIKAEL: THAT WAS TOTALLY WRONG OF ME. I'M SORRY. MIKAEL: THIS TUNE SAYS IT BETTER THAN I CAN. YOMI: UNNSKYLD (SORRY) Hi. Ready? Everyone's got a chance. - Hey... - What? I have to go back to the others. MIKAEL: DID YOU LIKE THE TUNE? CONFIRM FRIEND REQUEST - Who are you talking to? - Just Dad. Hey. I'd like to show you something. - Coming? - Okay. Isn't it nice? You're so sexy when you're dancing. No, Aksel... Not now. What's wrong? Don't you think the others are waiting for us? Why don't you just tell me what's wrong? Nothing. I'm just saying we should go back. I should have listened to you and not to myself But if it's any comfort, nothing is decided I know you feel I let you down when all I tried to do was show the way But I think I read the signs all wrong So let me tell you that I'm sorry Can you hear me? Yes, it was only my fault Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? - You came! - Yes. Seriously... I'm sorry. I mean it. It was... I was totally out of line. I should have thought twice about it. I hope it will be okay? - Josef. - Amalie. - You thought life was wonderful? - I knew it! It's not always wonderful. Okay. Sorry about that as well. I'm sorry about everything. Cool? It's all right. Want to train with us? It's so much fun! You have to join us. Honestly... You're wrong. Dance is supposed to be fun. Come on. Then just watch. Okay. Cool. Impressive. I'm really impressed. That was so good! Shit... - Nice earrings. - Would you like to have them? - Seriously? - Sure. I've got a lot. - Shit, you're cool. - Playing it nice. - See you. - Yup. Seriously... You're awesome. That was intense. You are awesome. Thanks. If you think that... We give and take equally much... Sorry, I'm just fucking with you. That's it. Yes. Complete movements, Charlotte. No, no... Stop! I simply can't stand looking at this. No, no, no. I find it embarrassing that you dance like mechanical dolls. Well... Only one of you is close to communicating something. Come on. Show them. No, not you. Amalie, come. Come, Amalie. So. And... Good. She is telling us something. Easy now. Accentuate the movement. Thank you. Excellent, Amalie. That's how it's done. Are those slightly bohemian or is it just me? I just thought... I feel they amplify the movements in modern. There are so many new things about you these days. - You have a private teacher. Right? - No. Or is there something else? You never hang out with us anymore, and... - What is this? - You don't want to party with us either. - No, Charlotte. - Yes, I do. But if there won't be a party, tell us. Aren't we going to have a party? We'll have a party. And I don't have a private teacher. Fine. Whatever you say. - Why do you go on like that, Charlotte? - Well, I have to ask. - You can talk to me about things. - It's nothing! Just forget it! - I'd like to show you something. - Okay. - It's close by. - Okay. It's so nice here. In Groruddalen? In Groruddalen. I sucked so much today. How long until the audition? - Two weeks. - Oh, my God. I have to practice. - Could we train at your place today? - Of course. Thanks. Hi! We're off for a ride today. Aksel. What are you doing here? I can’t today. - Why not? - I have to practice. Then I'll just give you a ride. It's not like we have to be together all the time! - But we're never together. - What the hell? You seem to think I have a duty to report to you! I'll take the underground. It's faster anyway. AKSEL... WE HAVE TO TALK. No! What's that? Once more. Back again. Ready... And go. That's it. Yes. Good, Amalie. Great. Yes. There you go. And... - No, that's enough. Go to the back. - I know it, I was just unfocused. You act like a baby now. Didn't you hear me? Charlotte, go to the back. - Please... - Now! Now! Go. Oh, dear. Drama queen. - Charlotte, are you okay? - I'm great. And you're doing fabulously. - Who is Mikael? - Did you take her phone? Have you lost it completely? Who is Mikael, Amalie? Is he your coach? No. But what matters is you can't cope with anyone being better than you. I shared. I let you train at my place. You don't share shit! All you share is bad vibes! I can't believe you took her phone. You can't do that! No, that's not okay. See? Bad vibes. Shit... - Drama queen. - The first time Birgitta's been right. There's a battle at the end of the month. This time, I thought I would ask you. Would you like to dance with me? Yes, I would. Awesome. - Break? - There's a first time for everything. You'll be amazing. We just have to fill it in, like this. Then you have to press it. Shit. The first time I saw you... It was just like... Oh, my God! And now... Oh, fuck. CALL REJECTED WHAT'S HAPPENING? I'M AT YOUR DOOR... - I have to go. - You have to go? - I forgot an appointment with Dad. - Oh, no, don't go... - Mikael... - Stay. Seriously. Hi, Aksel. I can explain. No, it's just temporary. In a hotel? Which one? Aksel, I don't want to talk about it. Can't we just forget it? Right. What have you told the others? I haven't told them. And what are you planning to do about the summer party? Can't we have it at your place? Yes... - Of course we can. - I promise to fix everything. But, damn it, you have to start being honest with me, Amalie. From now on, I demand... that you show me you feel the same way. Come here. MIKAEL: WANT TO DANCE WITH ME TODAY? Thanks for paying. I'll transfer it to you right away. No stress. My God, I'm so sick of Birgitta's style. The way she treats Vanessa... I would feel really hurt. I would die if someone made those comments about me. Let's go in here! - Here? - Yes. - Nille? - They've got lots of decoration stuff. Okay. - Like these lights. - Light strands? That's out, right? Isn't that so 2008 or something? It might have been good for last year's party. I don't think that would fit in. But how about some tealights? Amalie? These? Or maybe colored ones? - Nille lights? - They're best in test. They burn an incredibly long time. One light burns for 6 hours. But they come in colors as well. Or do we stick to white? That’s classier. We'll be both indoors and outdoors. How about colors outdoors and white indoors? - Hi! What's up? - Hi. - Sorry, I'm just fucking with you. - Hello. - Everything okay? - We're kind of in a hurry. - We're on our way out. - Have to buy this first. No, let's do it some other day. Come on, Ida. - But I'll see you afterwards, right? - Eh... Yes. - We'll text each other? - Yes, I'll send you a message. - Come. - Let's do it now. No, we have to go. Who were they? Do you know them? - They clean our house. - You let them clean your house? What was her problem? - She ignored you. Just left. - You know nothing. - Want candles? - Candles? AMALIE: CAN'T THIS WEEK. MY PERIOD. Come on. Lightly. Has anyone seen Charlotte? - Amalie, have you seen Charlotte? - No. Okay. One more time. Looking good today. Aksel. Come here. A question about the party. Will the sea side or the garden side be the main area? DANCE WITH ME Probably the garden side. Amalie? I think you should apologize to Charlotte. You could have told her that you have a coach on the side. I don't! He's a cleaner. You met him. Yes, but like... You see that it's wrong. - She's been a bitch for a long time. - There's a reason why she's not here. - She was hurt by what you said. - Can't anyone accept that I'm good? Hi. WHEN? Maybe some document to make it look a bit better? Hi. Going to a party? What's up? Sorry I didn't answer your last message. My last messages. It's all right. Everyone has a lot to do. I've also been busy. Probably you, too. I have to go. - You have to go? - Yes, I'm in a hurry. - You know, it was only a game. - What? You and me. This. Seriously? It would never have worked out. No. I guess not. Fuck... Hi! Come, Amalie. Boasting. Is that what this is about? That I have another name for the same color? - Aksel, I need to talk to you. - I'll just wrap this up. You can see it one way, and I see it another way. - I need to talk to you. - Okay... Where's Amalie? I want to talk to her. I'll just take care of this. - Where is Amalie? - Charlotte, take it easy. Calm down. I let you train in my house. I've always been there for you. And then you steal the Netherlands away from me! You've got fucking everything. And then you take this away from me, too! I'm sorry. "Sorry"? Yes, because... That will of course save my presentation. "Sorry"... - Sorry?! Damn whore! - Hey! - Get out! - Don't touch me. I can leave on my own! Then leave on your own! Hey... I'm sorry. Someone should help her. Amalie? Who's he? Mikael? How did you know I was here? What do you think? You're tagged everywhere. Amalie? Who is this? That's her cleaner. He doesn't know about me, does he? Amalie? That you've got a guy from Ellingsrud on the side? - I'm a joke, right? - What the hell is this? We've been together, okay? She and I. We hooked up. All the dancing... You just used me. Shit... I'm just a dancer. With none of this fancy stuff. But at least I know who I am. - Mikael... - No. Stay away from me. Bro, stay far away from her because she'll break your heart. Aksel. Please... - No. Go get your things. - Listen to me. Please. Go get your things! Put on some music. Music, dammit! Welcome to Mikael's phone. I'm busy now. Leave a message after the beep. Mikael. I'm sorry. I've been so incredibly fucked. Please pick up the phone. WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION? LOOKING FOR WORK OR BEING LAID OFF? ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WORK? CATEGORY ALL STYLES 1 VS 1 That's all for today. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Amalie, could you stay for a minute? - What's happening? - Nothing. Okay. Show me the last part of the choreography for the audition. What the hell is going on? I've seen you develop from a mediocre dancer to a very special one. Hello! Where did you go? Are you serious? Haven't you picked up anything that happened lately? - Then use it, dammit. - Use it? Everybody hates me! Good. Then you've got something to communicate. Use it, for fuck's sake. See you at the audition. Thank you, Ida. Vanessa. Come up here. Are you ready? Thank you. It's Charlotte's turn. Come. - Yeah, I have seen enough. - Thank you. Thank you, Charlotte. Amalie? Hello...? Don't you feel well, Amalie? Would you like some water? Okay. Let's do it from the top. No. - No? - No. What do you mean? This is not me. All this hasn't got shit to do with me. I don't belong here. That place isn't mine. I'm meant for something else. Hi, Ida. Mikael! No! Seriously? Won't happen! I'm not dancing against her. - Honestly, folks. - Just do it. - Just get it over with. - Use it! - Did you listen to your voicemail? - No. - Won't you please listen to me? - I'll crush you, okay? I listened to you when you made a fool of me in front of everyone. That's different. Amalie! You love him! - Eh? - You have to show him! From your heart. Come on! Okay! - One round and you're done. - Finish what you started, man! It was no game. I know it's hard for you to believe me, but it's true. I just want you to know that... if you give me another chance, I promise I won't fuck up. Subtitle translation by Bjørn Giertsen
