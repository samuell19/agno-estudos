(film reel whooshing) (heartbeat thudding) (lion roars) (logo whooshes) (heartbeat thudding) - [Reporter] Good morning everyone. Big music industry news today. The world's hottest young pop star is back with a new- - Jordan Lacey releases his second studio album, "Commedia," at number one today. - Fans around the world are not going to forget this one anytime soon. A big and bold return. (equipment clattering) (footsteps tapping) (guitar tuning) - Focus on the hits. No tangents on the artistic crap, all right? Focus on the big songs because that's what drives the most traffic to the album. This is about the album, and it's about everybody who made the album. It's not just about you. You get that, right? And do me a favor. Whatever happens, do not bring up "End of You." Someone else brings it up, change the subject. No, let's keep this light, let's keep it bouncy. Don't bring up your mother. It's just gonna kill the energy. Yes, it is incredibly tragic what happened, but this is not the time or the place to work through that. Why do we have (grunts), Faruq? Can you please come get this guitar offset? And who are we waiting on? Does anyone know how long this is? - I am so sorry to keep you waiting. - Oh no! We're gonna be here all day anyway. Don't worry about it. - Jen Dalby, from "Top Beat Online." - Yes, of course. Good to see you again. - Didn't know if you'd remember me. - Of course I remember you. Wow. You look fantastic. - Thank you. (chuckles) - Still single? (chuckles) (snorts) No, I'm kiddin'. - [Jen] Okay. Speeding? - [Cameraman] Speeding. - Okay. The indisputable super producing team behind "Commedia," which is, wow, stunning. Three hit singles that have dominated the top 100 since September of last year. It's bold, it's ambitious, but it's honest. Especially the song "End of You." I heard you actually wrote that one about your- - Mother, yeah. - Someone said it was the first song you wrote on the album and you wrote it in 10 minutes. - Yeah, that's true. - Yeah and it definitely led to some breakthroughs and kinda bigger, punchier songs that I brought Jordan: "Admit One," "Special Now." Tell her how it opened up "Special Now." - Yeah. - That one's a real banger, huh? - It is. (chuckles) It's the number one song in the world right now. But we were talking "End of You." Did I see a guitar in here earlier? Can can we fly that in? - I don't know. You probably have some other questions to... - Come on. Just a little bit? - Okay, maybe just a little, I guess. But yeah, I just kinda worked out some chords a little bit, and yeah. (gentle guitar music) ♪ Yeah, I had a dream ♪ ♪ Had a dream last night ♪ ♪ That you spoke to me, yeah ♪ ♪ Out from the dark ♪ ♪ Into lasting light ♪ ♪ Into fantasy, yeah ♪ ♪ I swear to God I been searchin' for, searchin' for ♪ And um, so yeah, we started with that little bit and then we kinda worked our way up into the chorus and... ♪ This is the end of you ♪ ♪ This is the end of you ♪ ♪ There's no rest, no hope, no love, no fight, not anymore ♪ ♪ Yeah, this is the end of you ♪ ♪ This is the end of you ♪ ♪ There's no you ♪ Um, so yeah, that's basically it right there. - Hey. (clapping) - Just gotta mess around a little bit. (both clapping) - Oh God, it is my favorite song. I think I love it even more acoustically. You must be so proud of Jordan's growth with a song like this. - Oh, I am. I just sometimes need to remind him to slow down and smell the roses, ya know? (chuckles) - It would be so cool to hear an entire acoustic version of the album. Would you consider doing something like that in the future? - Oh yeah, for sure. - That's an interesting idea. So, do you have any other questions for Jordan about the production of "Commedia"? Because I know he'd wanna talk about the process behind "Special Now." - Actually, my next question is another personal one for Jordan, and maybe pretend he's not in the room for a moment. - (chuckles) Oh. - Do you ever feel pressure to stay in a particular lane musically? I mean, your team and label backing are so massive, I have to ask. - I mean, my team has done an absolute amazing job, you know, helping me through the stumbling blocks of my career, and I mean, when you start as young as I am, it's like impossible to wrap your head around what's actually happening to you, right? It's crazy to think about, yeah, but no, musically I'm in control, and anything that I release with my name on it is a reflection of me and that's just, that's just how it's gonna be. I can promise you that. (tense music) (somber guitar music) (somber guitar music continues) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing continues) (tense music) - [Dustin] Hello? - [Recording] Hi, thanks for contacting Stars for Democracy. If you'd like to make a donation, please leave a message specifying the charity to which you'd like to contribute, and someone will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you. (voicemail beeps) - [Dustin] Dustin Lacey. Call him back. Jordan's brother, trying to get a hold of him. Been calling his management company, Dean Michaels Management. Ain't nobody know how to pick up the phone over there either, so anyway, could you just do me solid? Gimme a call back so I can figure out how to get in touch with Jordan. I'd very much love that and appreciate. All right. Thank you. (tense music) (car door thuds) - [Director] Okay, Jordan, ready to go? Get lights on him sitting. (clapperboard clicks) All right, quiet on set. Camera speeds. And action. (dramatic music) - Trying to make the world a better place is much more difficult than making money. You can only measure it if you have a strategy. In 2015, I recognized a tremendous power of emerging technologies to align and empower notable public figures. It was a unprecedented opportunity. This was the idea behind Stars for Democracy. (cameras clicking) - Max's vision is revolutionary. He has a real eye for systemic dysfunction in societies today, and a proven track record of affecting positive change. - He's such a beautiful man, compassionate. I'm so honored every time he reaches out with a new initiative. Feeling like I can be part of real change is the most beautiful feeling in the world. - I have been fortunate enough to know Max for several years, and I mean, he's brilliant. It's as simple as that. (upbeat rock music) - And on behalf of Stars for Democracy, it is my pleasure to personally announce the 2019 Global Artist Weekend, streaming live on all platforms this Thursday through Sunday. - The biggest artists in the world streaming live from over 50 countries directly to you, and alongside the performance videos, there'll be an option to donate to Stars for Democracy's many ongoing charities. Find out more about how you can make a difference. - I'll be closing out the event this Sunday evening with the debut of a new single. - I'll be performing live from the UK. Can wait to see you all so soon. - Very excited to celebrate with you and enjoy the music of the world's leading artists for the purpose of change. Remember, we're stronger together. See you online. (dramatic rock music) - (sighs) 50 different locations in countries all over the world, dressed exactly the same for one event. It's preposterous, but it's happening. Viewership's been the same for the last three years, so guess it's working. - But why no audience? Does he not make more money if there's audience? - It's one of Max's ideas. No audience, all online, more control that way. That's what Max likes. Control. Take note of that so you don't learn the hard way. Where'd you say you're from again? - [Romina] Odessa. - Huh? - A small seaport on Black Sea. - Where? - Ukraine. Ukraine. - Oh, Russia. Right. So I don't have to tell you, you know all about control. - Why? - Are they communist over there or something? - [Romina] No. - I swear they're communist. - No. - Faruq, bring Dr. Briton to Jordan for an NAD. Kick out whoever else is in there with him and see what else he needs. Rehearsal's in 30 minutes. Who? - Meet our new tour assistant. - Pleasure. Actually, I could choose you for something. Why don't you have her bring Dr. Briton. - Yeah. That works. Jordan's green room is down the hall to the right. - Dr. Briton with her, Faruq with me. Where is Hayley? (tense music) (fist pounding) (tense music continues) - You have done this before, I take it. - Many times. - [Hayley] Hurry up, Jordan. - Shh, shh, shh, don't move. Don't move. (tense music) (knuckles tapping) Gimme a minute. - [Dr. Briton] Jordan, it's Dr. Briton. - One minute! - [Hayley] Would you just do it already? You know she has to come in here. - Hey, still. You promised me this. - And nothing more. - You know, I thought maybe once I got you laying down on your back a little bit, just maybe just a little, you know, a little (lips smacking). - No. - Just a little. - No. - Nothing. Nothing? - No, we put all that behind us. (Jordan sighs) - You cold, cold bitch. - Yep. Now just hurry up and do it so we can move on to bigger and better things with our day, please. - [Jordan] Yeah, yeah, hey, that is your loss. (Jordan sniffing) Oh yeah, that's good. That's the one. That's the one. (tense music) - You know, I feel like I just aged about 10 years doing that. - Fuck you. (tense music) - So, can I get you anything else before rehearsal? (tense music continues) (bottle sloshes) No. No. - Then nothing. - Great, I'll see you on stage in 20 minutes. (kisses smack) (door rattles) He's all yours. (door rattles and thuds) (Jordan vomiting) (toilet flushes) (tense music) (tense music continues) (lid clatters) (tense music continues) (liquid sloshing) (bottle clatters) (chair creaks) - Not feeling so good? - [Jordan] I'm fine. - Have you been eating? - [Jordan] Yeah. - When was the last time you took anything? - Like five seconds ago? (Jordan chuckles) (tense music) You new? You're not nervous like the other ones. I like that. (tense bass music) - Hey, how you feelin'? - Good to go. - Need anything else? - Tell Dean to let me get through the whole song, okay? No notes till the end. - All right, I'll try my best, huh? - Yeah. (instruments tuning up) Hey, we're gonna play "End of You," right? (jacket rustling) Good? (sighs) Let's get it.

What happened to the new song? - It's not ready. We haven't gigged it in yet. - Oh, well you see, that's why we're here. So that you can gig it in. - Gigging it in requires an audience. - What do you call the 30 people that are out there? - It's not gonna be ready, I'm tellin' you. - (chuckles) Yeah, well, you got four days to make it ready. - Why does it matter what I play? We're like, we're gonna take in a lotta money for Stars either way, so does it really matter what I, does it really matter what I play? - So, you're gonna play the new song because that's what was agreed upon. This song was written specifically for this set, which I might remind you, this very generous man here is paying you $5 million for 20 minutes of performance. - I don't care about the money. - [Dean] How about your reputation? - I don't care about the reputation. - What do you care about, man? - I just wanna play "End of You," and if I had it my way, I would play it acoustically. - You are not going to play "End of You." - I'm not gonna play some cotton candy, '80s-sounding dog shit with lyrics that I don't even know what the hell it, like... ♪ Ooh, yeah we're stronger together ♪ ♪ Let's beat it now ♪ ♪ Yeah, this sick time, sick. ♪ ♪ Let's beat it ♪ What the hell does that even mean, man? - It's a message that even an idiot can understand. - Because it's political. - Because it's what sells. - Dean. Dean. (ominous music) Jordan, let me provide some context as to why this song is so important for this event. Attached to your new singles- - Your new single's- - Not my song. I didn't write it. - Attached to our new single's world premiere is an entire marketing strategy to support the online engagement for the Stars community. It's not just about money. Hardly, in fact. I (chuckles), I don't need any more money. I have enough. No, it's about community mobilization. Quite frankly, it's about social media. Social media has helped so many great causes, so many in the same way. I think you'll agree with me, it's helped a lot of people. It's responsible for your career, isn't it? - Yeah, it's responsible for me jacking off to Rita Ora's titties three times a week. - All right, okay. All right. - [Jordan] That's what it's responsible for. (chuckles) - Max. I must have a minute with him. - It's the truth. It's a valuable resource for my mental health. It's just a fact. - Man. Man, man, man, man, man. What are you doin'? What is going on up here, hmm? It has been almost a year of this weak-ass, self-loathing, tortured artist bullshit and I'm fuckin' over it. And you know who else is losing their patience with you? Max. And Max is also losing his patience with the person whose job it is to make sure that you show up to work with a good attitude, and that person is me. So you know what that means? - What does that mean? - It means that you and I have a fuckin' problem. - Gimme a fucking break. (hand smacks) (tense music) Consider that a loving reminder of who's fucking in charge here, okay? 'Cause you're not sitting here with that smug-ass fucking attitude if it's not for me, and don't forget that. (sighs) (tense music continues) (Dean sighs) I need you to get your shit together. You seem to have forgotten where you came from. You seem to have forgotten that I plucked you out of obscurity after I happened to be fucking your sob story of a mother. What's the real issue here, man? You say you don't care about money, you don't care about your reputation. So what do you care about? You know who's responsible for keeping you at number one on the charts for three consecutive years? Max Meszarov. And if you think for one second that he's gonna sit by and smile while you piss all over his event, boy, buddy. (chuckles) You're playin' a dangerous game here, man. Do what Max tells you to. Play the songs that he tells you to play. Big, punchy sounds that stay and live in the hearts, the minds, and the fucking crotches of the billions of people who are gonna be watching. That's what you're going to be doing this weekend. And if I get anymore pushback from you, Jordan, I swear to God, I will fucking kill you, okay? I am not kidding. I will end your life. And it would be doing you a favor, because if we left it up to Max, he would have both of us just disappear. Just poof, like our careers never existed. Believe me when I tell you that there is a fate worse than death in this business. Okay, so, take a minute, center yourself, and then I wanna see you out on that stage, I wanna see you putting everything you have into "Sick Time," okay? (cigarette crackles) You need anything, man? Water, coffee, protein bar? - I'm good. - Good?

Jordan. (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (bedding rustling) (bed creaking) (birds chirping) (Jordan coughs) (birds chirping) - Hey. - Hey. How are you feeling? - Horrible. Was it bad? - Does it matter? We need to get you over to the venue by two o'clock. - I can't do this. - You have to. - No. - Jordan. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (drawer scrapes) (suspenseful music continues) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (phone ringing) (Jordan sighs) (phone buzzing) - Thank God. Jordan, how you feeling? - Not good. - Well, I figured after the whole Amy Winehouse display. As usual, Dean chewed me out for the whole thing. So for that, thank you. And I found a empty bottle of cough syrup on you. Wasn't that surprising? Dude, I thought you were done with that shit. - Oh, I am. - Good. - I'm stopping everything, man. I'm not doing the gig this weekend. - Wait. What? - Hayley and I are just gonna drive up to Ojai for a couple weeks, okay? We're just gonna spend some time, you know. - No, no, no, no, no. Jordan? Listen to me. I know you're barely hanging on right now, man, but you got six weeks left. Six weeks and then you can take all the time you need to recharge. You know, Dean. He's not gonna allow that. - Yeah, you can tell Dean that he could come and chase me up to Ojai if he wants and personally drag me out of the detox center, okay? Faruq, that's what he could do. That's what he could do. - Jordan, you know what? You're right. Fuck Dean. I'm beggin' you, man, don't put me in this position. - I'll let you decide how to tell him, buddy, okay? - No, no, no. Jordan, please. - Okay? Okay. I'm hanging up now, buddy, okay? Bye-bye. Bye-bye. (Faruq screams) - I want to swim in pool. - What? - You have pool. I want to swim. - Yeah, you could swim. - I don't have suit. - You could have one of one of Raaka's, come here. (tense music) Just take whatever you want. We're leaving. - [Hayley] We don't have to be at the venue for another couple of hours. - No, we're leaving LA. - Why would we do that? (gentle music) - Things have been pretty insane lately. - You think? - Yeah. And maybe you and I can spend some time, maybe get away a little bit, and I just, hey, I really wanna just give this a shot. - Jordan, I think that you are just way too in your own head right now, okay? And I think that's what's happening. I think you need to take this time to relax before we have to get you back over to the venue, okay? - I don't need to relax, I need you to listen to me. I need you to understand what's going on, okay? I have called Faruq. He's talking with Dean. We're good. We go through like this all the time. They have to gimme time off, okay? They have to gimme time off. He has to. - Jordan, why don't I make you some breakfast, okay? - No! We are going to go and you're gonna sit right here. You find some clothes of Raaka's. I'm gonna go get you a bag and we're leaving, okay? We're leaving. Just stay here. You're fine, all right? You're fine. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. (door thuds) - Okay. (birds chirping) - [Romina] Towel? - Bathroom. (tense music) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (water splashes) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tires crunching) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (shoes tapping) (tense music) - Thank you. - Will that be all, Miss Fife? - Yes. Thank you so much. (somber music) (phone ringing) Yeah. Hello? What the hell kind of driver did you send to pick me up? I don't know, she gave me weird fuckin' vibes. No, I'm not fucked up. All right, I'm a little fucked up. Stop. - Just find something comfy. We'll leave in 15, okay? - Whatever you say. - [Jordan] Okay. (tense music) (lighter flicks) (tense music continues) (lighter flicks) (cork pops) - Yeah, no, I'm good to go. (wine sloshing) Tell him I just landed from London! I'm exhausted and just opened a bottle of rose. I can come in later tonight, I guess, but right now I'm literally about to fall over sideways. Okay, I don't even know if he's home. I'll check and have him call Dean. Oh, I'm not his fucking assistant, okay? I'm hanging up now. All right, see you later. Bye! (Raaka groans) Unbelievable. Jordan? (soft ominous music) Jordan. Jordan? (tense music) Jordan, call Dean right now and tell him I don't want to... What the fuck? - Let me explain. - What are you... You're fucking her again. What the fuck is wrong with you, Jordan? - No, no. - [Raaka] You, get the fuck outta my house! - I did not fuck her. We did not fuck. I thought you were supposed to be in London. - Yeah, well, that would've been fucking convenient for you. I'm not doing this again. I'm not. I'm so done. Do you think I need this? Do you think I need to go through this again with your pathetic ass? - We didn't do anything, baby. We didn't, I, we were... Listen to me, I been goin' through a lotta shit, okay? I don't know who I am. I don't know where I am anymore, okay? I just, I need a break. I need a fucking, I need a fucking break, okay? - That's clear. - And this doesn't mean that I don't love you. - (chuckles) You small, sad little boy. I don't love you anymore. I don't need you. - What are you saying? - I said, I don't need you. And if you can't tell by the amount of people who follow me on social media and listen to my music, I am so much better than you. So much more important than you, Jordan. - Baby, if you think posting on Instagram your titties every day makes you better than me... I don't know, I don't give a fuck about your followers. Does that make you better than me? - Yes, it does. - Baby. - That makes me better than the disgusting, drugged out, talentless piece of shit in front of me. Yes, it does. - Oh yeah. Oh yeah! Yeah, yeah. Really funny. You do know that none of this matters, right? None of this matters. - Jordan. - Because we're fucking trapped, that's why. (tense music) (Jordan and Raaka chattering) Come inside. (Jordan and Raaka chattering) - Jordan. - What? - What if I told you I slept with someone every night on the European tour the past two months? And I have them all right here in my DMs. What would you say to that? - What would I say to that? I would say you have a problem. I would say that's fucking disgusting. - Of course that's what you think because you can't get pussy like that. - What the hell is wrong with you? - You're a pathetic, scared little boy. No one loves little emo Jordan. - All right, maybe I don't want pussy like that, Raaka. Okay, maybe I don't want that. Maybe I don't wanna play this constant game of how much of a digital fuck symbol I can be in a world whose only desire is to see me on a six-inch screen as a digital fuck symbol! (tense music) (tense music continues) - Jordan, you're part of that world whether you like it or not, and guess what? You're on your way out. No one cares about your genuine lyrics. Boring. (Raaka chattering) (tense music) You understand that, Jordan? You're second best. (tense music continues) (Raaka continues chattering) (gun cocks) (tense music continues) - Jordan the fuck symbol driving the banging party bus to digital fuckdom, woo! - Would you pull yourself together? (door thuds) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (blood splats) - I just did you favor. Time to leave, pretty boy. (dramatic music) (gun butt thuds) (soft suspenseful music) (traffic whirring) (suspenseful music continues) (traffic continues whirring) (suspenseful music continues) (traffic continues whirring) (suspenseful music continues) (traffic continues whirring) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (traffic whirring) (tires crunching) (dramatic music) (bag rustling) - You killed my girlfriend. - [Romina] I did. - Why? (gun clatters) (pills rattle) Answer me. Why? - [Romina] That girlfriend was lost in dream she did not know she was in. She was sleepwalking like so many hopeless souls in world today. There is no way to help someone like that other than to wake them up. - Wake them up? What do you mean wake them up? You blew her fucking brains out. - You think she care about you? Do you think anyone in your life care about you? Look at you. Pitiful. Completely powerless away from your money and your flashy friends? And what do you hear, hmm? - Listen. What do you hear? Nothing. No sirens, no helicopters, no search party. For all the pomp and circumstance surrounding your performance, hmm, you must realize nobody really care about you or people like your girlfriend. But I see you, Jordan Lacey. I know everything there is to know about you, who you are, what you do. I know things even you yourself don't know. I guess that makes me your best friend. Never had anyone in your life like that have you? Well, you did. Your mother. - You don't know shit about my mom. Who are you? (dramatic music) (door rattles) - [Kidnapper] Romina. (door thuds) (door rattles) (Faruq breathing heavily) - Jordan? - Faruq. - [Faruq] Jordan. Holy shit. - Jesus Christ, how the fuck did they get you? - [Faruq] I don't know, they grabbed me once I got to your place. - Why were you at my place? - [Faruq] You hung up on me, man. You're my best friend and my job was on the line. I wanted to talk sense into you, and then when I got there, I'm being shoved in the back of a fucking hatchback. Who does that? - Yeah, yeah, well, that Ukrainian bitch shot Raaka. - [Faruq] What? - Her head's all over my fucking wall, man. - [Faruq] Shit. She's definitely not a real tour assistant. - No, she's not. Who the fuck hired her? - [Faruq] Jordan, that guy in there, he's on the phone with Dean. - What? - [Faruq] I heard Dean's voice on the phone. I think they want something from us. - Yeah, I know that. - [Faruq] I don't know what, but my mind goes to dark places, man. - No, no, Max will get his out of here, okay? Max will get us out of here. He's got too much shit going on this weekend. I'm too important, man. - [Faruq] Yeah, well, he better do it quick. What if this guy's one of those crazed psycho fans with nothing else to live for but finding a way to take all your money, or worse, killing you and keeping me as his personal sex toy. Oh, he's probably gonna make one of those crazy ultimate acts of violence video statements like terrorists do. - Shit, none of this makes any sense. - [Faruq] No, of course it doesn't. - What, you think he planned to shoot Raaka? - [Faruq] How could I possibly know that? - That's what you said, dumbass. You said crazy psycho fan. - How would I have any... You think I have any idea what the fuck is going on? - Raaka and I were just fighting and the shit that she was saying, man, I just wanted to... - Okay, Jordan. - And then... - Jordan, don't think - What the fuck - about that right now. - am I doing here? - [Faruq] Okay, you gotta focus, man. We gotta focus and find a way outta here. Maybe we can rub against something. - I can't focus for shit, man. I'm about to fuckin' puke. - [Faruq] Jordan, stop. - [Jordan] You stop. - [Faruq] Don't talk to me that way. - No, no, maybe it's best that I just sit back and you just leave me here, huh? That's probably - Jordan, - for the better, right? - you know what, buddy, this isn't one of the times for your depressed fucking moods, okay? Get it together and we'll find a way- - Don't act like you're not a part of this corrupt team that got us here in the first place, motherfucker. - [Faruq] What the hell are you talking about? - If I am being held ransom here for whatever reason, it's because I'm the center point of a money-making machine. You understand that, right? You get that. You, Hayley, Dean, all you guys. - [Faruq] Oh, gimme a break. I'm on rinky-dink salary. - Fuck you. - Stop. - You stop! - Stop. - You stop! - [Faruq] You stop it right now. You stop it right now. You're acting like a goddamn baby, okay? I will not let your depressive ass pull me out. I am getting outta here. I am not dying today! Help me find a way out! Fuck! (tense music) (door thuds) (chairs clicking) (tense music continues) (tripod thuds) (switch beeps) (tense music continues) (Dustin sniffs) (tense music) - Be good audience, eh? (tense music continues) Ready? (button beeps) - Hello. Dustin Lacey. Musician, older brother of recording artist Jordan Lacey. I'm making a statement to officially announce to y'all that we got an upcoming single, and to celebrate we're gonna be performing live this Sunday at the Global Artist Weekend. This collaboration between Jordan and I has been a long time comin', but we're both very excited to take the stage together for the first time publicly. Gonna have the help of Jordan's manager, his entire team, as well as that of the wonderful people at Stars for Democracy. Confident it's gonna be an exceptional moment for both Jordan and myself. Watershed moment, in fact, for Jordan's entire career direction. We'll be unveiling a new sound, a new voice together, as brothers and as artists. We hope you like it. We hope you'll join us in this new chapter, new sound, new promise to shape a better culture, and through that, a better future for all of us. So I thank you kindly for listening, and we'll see you there at two p.m. this Sunday, Global Artist Weekend. Thank you. (switch beeps) (Faruq laughs) - [Faruq] Sorry. - What are you laughing at? - No one's ever gonna believe this. Jordan doesn't have a brother. (ominous music) Jordan, you don't have a brother. (ominous music continues) - Hello there, little brother. It's good to see you again. (dramatic music) (keys clacking) You sure this is his official channel? - [Romina] Yes, that's what it says. Look, 20 million subscriber. - [Dustin] What's the status? - [Romina] Processing. - You people mind telling us what the fuck is going on? (ominous music) - Why is he here again? - [Romina] I told you, he showed up at house. He would've compromised us. We had to take him. - All right, well then we're gonna have to get rid of him. - Hey, no, no, no, no! - Dustin, what do you want? - No! - I'm sorry, man. Hurtin' your girlfriend was not my intention. - [Faruq] No, please. Please. - I'm sorry, man, I don't know who the fuck you are, but you're in my way. - I don't wanna die. - Stop! Stop! What do you want? What do you want, money? I could help you. - I don't want your money. - What then? - I want fuckin' redemption. - God, please don't... - Shut the fuck up! - What do you mean redemption? - After this video finishes uploading, you and I got 36 hours to write a hit single together. It'll redeem your name and free you from your oppressors, Jordan. - You're insane. (chuckles) You're fuckin' insane. - You and I are gonna make a real goddamn song, one that the cocksuckin' corporate scum can't touch. Someone needs to do it, man. Someone needs to make a change, and you got the platform to do it. - Do something. - I said shut the fuck up! (tense music) Really pissin' me off now, motherfucker. - Hey- - Shut the fuck up! It's your call. - Fucking, just let him go. Just let him go. Just let him go and I'll hear you out, all right? - Excuse me? I don't think you're the one dictating terms here. - You don't wanna kill him. It's more blood on your hands. You think you're dictating terms. Dustin, there's nothing you could offer me that would make me wanna write music with you. Shot my girlfriend. Fucking stripped me from a life I hated anyway. So, I've got nothing to lose. I could sit here and wait for them to come hunt down you and your little assistant, which I know they are. I know they are. Hundred percent. Hundred percent. You're fucked. You could threaten to torture me, kill me, do whatever the fuck you wanna do. I have nothing left to lose. I have zero life to go back to. (somber music) Or let him go unharmed and I'll listen to one of your ideas for a song. - [Faruq] Jordan. - Shut the fuck up. Deal. (ominous music) (door clicks) (door thuds) (tense music) (Faruq breathing heavily) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (Faruq grunts) (gun cocks) - [Romina] You hear this? (Faruq breathing heavily) (tense music) Now, count back from 100 before you take bag off head. (tense music continues) - [Faruq] 100, 99. (door thuds) (tense music continues) (gentle guitar music) - I watched an interview of yours from a few years back. You looked healthier back then. Looked like you gave a shit about the music. You were talking about my favorite song off your second album. It was about Mom. And I was goin' through some hard times back then, so it stuck with me. Figured I'd take the liberty to make a little instrumental arrangement. (soft tense music) (keys click) Offer you a proper audition. (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - What else you got? - Fresh lyrics and a melody that needs your magic touch. She would've wanted this, you know. - You sure about that? You hardly knew her. - You hardly knew him. Why don't we see what he has to say about it? (tense music) (tense music continues) (door clicks) (crickets chirping) (door creaks) (tense music) (door creaks) (tense music) Dad. (clears throat) Dad, wake up. Hey. Hey. There's someone here to see you. (gentle music) - Hey, kid. Long time no see. Come here. Come closer. (gentle music) (soft tense music) I'm so happy you're here. The two of ya, together again. (gentle music) (father snoring softly) (gentle music) - [Jordan] What makes you think this is a good idea? - Call it faith. - Why should I trust you? I don't know you. (Dustin scoffs) - Who you got left to trust? - [Hayley] They had you tied up? - [Faruq] Yeah. - [Hayley] Jordan, too? - [Faruq] Yeah. - How were they treating him? - Better than me, I think. Did you know he had a brother? - No. No, I had no idea. (door clicks) - [Dean] When did you get back? - About an hour ago. - You didn't think to stay out there and give us a call so that maybe we'd be a little closer to finding Jordan? - I panicked. I called an Uber. I wanted to get the hell outta there. - (sighs) Who else is with this shit heel brother of his? - The new tour assistant, who's obviously not a real tour assistant, and at Jordan's place, there was this blonde badass of a lady who threw me in a car, although I didn't see her after that. - We thought she was a new hire on Raaka's detail. She picked her up from the airport Friday morning, not a trace. - Jesus. Raaka, what happened to her? Jordan- - No, no, we're not talking about that, okay? We're keeping that all buttoned up. - You didn't notify the authorities? - We have people on it. - She was murdered for God's sake. - Whoever told you, whatever you heard, it didn't happen. (tense music) - But we at least have to tell the police. - It didn't happen. Raaka never showed up at the house. We have no idea where she is. And if anyone asks, Jordan is rehearsing at an offsite location. He'll be back in this building ready to perform by two p.m. on Sunday. - Okay. - What is our next move here, Dean? - No idea, unless dipshit here can give us a clue. (sighs) Max, thoughts? - We get the brother back on the phone, track him through cell tower like we should have done the first time we got him on the line. - I can't do that. No call back number. - Then we give him a reason to call. (dramatic music) (tense music) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (suspenseful music) (birds continue chirping) (suspenseful music continues) - Jordan. - [Dustin] Motherfucker. Can you get him on the phone right now? - [Romina] Da. (birds chirping) - Your slimy piece of shit manager deleted my video. Yeah. - [Dean] Hello. - What's goin' on with Jordan's channel? I'm not seein' my video up there. - Really? I don't know what happened. - You don't know what happened? Fuckin' clown. - Scanning. - We both know that's bullshit. You deleted my video. (computer beeping) I don't have to bring him back Sunday. - Okay, calm down. I don't know what happened with the video. We didn't take it down. Why don't you just upload it again? - Processing. - How's Jordan? (computer chimes) - He's fine. - [Computer] Target locked. - All right, listen, this is what's gonna happen. We're puttin' the video back up. If anyone touches it, we're calling the whole weekend off, and you ain't gonna get a call back. And you'll never see or talk to Jordan again. How's that sound? - What? You're gonna run away? You're gonna go into hiding with a world famous pop star? How long you think that's gonna last? Come on, man. In fact, you've come too far on this. You're not gonna give up that easy. Dustin, Sunday is your big day. Don't just throw it away. (tense music) - Just, when the video goes back up, don't touch it, all right? Can you do that for me, please? - I will see you back here on Sunday. Let's go! (ominous music) - The upright will inhabit the land, and the men of integrity will remain in it. But the wicked'll be cut from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it. Yeah. Fuckin' turd. (eerie music) (tense music) (tense music continues) (car whirring) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (phone beeping) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (engine rumbling) (tense music) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (door clicks) (tense music continues) (soft ominous music) - [Guard 1] Clear! - [Guard 2] Clear. - What? I thought he'd be here. (Romina speaking in foreign language) (Romina continues speaking in foreign language) (no audio) (no audio) (Dustin sighs) - I can't leave him here. - Can't Romina just... - I'm... I'm sorry, Jordan. I gotta fold. (Dustin sighs) - I don't wanna go back. - You're doin' the song. It's yours now anyway. You wrote the shit out of it. Perform it. (no audio) (cigarette pack thuds) (lighter clicks) But thank you. - For what? - For givin' me a chance. Givin' me hope. (no audio) (no audio) Dad left Texas unannounced when he got his diagnosis. Took me months to track him down. And when I did, he told me he came out here to find you. He said just the thought of makin' that drive and bein' out here was enough closure. He didn't ever say goodbye to me back in Texas, so with that, life has taken pretty much everything there is to take from me. So I said fuck it. Came by here to find him, and when I got that story out of him, I made a promise I was gonna find you, too. So you could see yourself. Play a song together. (no audio) (Dustin exhales) - Do you have a family of your own? - They're gone. - Could you tell me what happened? - Maybe another time. (no audio) (gentle music) - [Jordan] He came all this way and has to give up. - You have no faith you can do this alone? (gentle music continues) - I used to have a necklace looked just like that. A tree. I don't know where it went. - That is too bad. - It was my mom's. - Well, maybe it will show up when you least expect, just like faith. (engine rumbling) - We are out of options here, okay? We have to get someone else involved. (engine rumbling) - Wait, what is that? - Dean, I have to call you back. (engine rumbling) - [Guard 2] Take cover, take cover, take cover. (tense music) - [Guard 1] Hold. Hold. (tense music continues) Target approaching. Go. Go! - [Guard 2] 75 feet. - [Guard 1] Hands up! - [Guard 2] Closing in. 50 feet. - [Guard 1] Cover me. Cover me. - [Guard 2] Covering. - [Guard 1] Target acquired. We're bringin' him home. (tense music continues) (somber music) (somber music continues) (shower pattering) (somber music continues) - Okay, everybody, let's give it up for having our guy home, huh? Safe and sound, huh? Yeah! (group applauding) - Okay, time is of the essence, so we're gonna keep this short. We're gonna keep it easy. Jordan, you've got a packet there in front of you. Inside is the final set list for tomorrow. Now, the first three songs are from the list that you submitted last week, and then the final song will be the new single "Sick Time." (gentle music) Now, we have anything you might need. Okay, the guest room is all set up for you to rehearse for the next 18 hours so that you are totally comfortable with the new music. I'm fuckin' pumped. I mean, this is going to be fucking awesome. Am I right? (group applauds) Is that doable? (gentle music) Jordan. Jordan. (tense music) We good? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [Dean] Yeah, we're good. Okay, everyone, let's get some sleep. Big day tomorrow. Big day. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (crickets chirping) (lighter clicks) (crickets chirping) - Spoke with Dean. He booked you a week at the Dava House in Ojai. We can drive up there on Monday. You can put all of this behind you. Get some rest. - And you're gonna stay with me up there? - For a little bit, yeah. - Little bit? - I mean, I work for Dean. I have to be on call. I have to be back down here. - Hayley, I hope you get everything you want one day soon. I really do. I hope you get the deal, the tour, the following, and the chains from Dean that come with it. Then maybe you could be as miserable as me, and you can discover for yourself that there's nothing left on the other side. Just emptiness. Then maybe you could finally look me in the eyes. - Jordan. - Yeah, I think it's time for you to get the fuck outta here. (crickets chirping) (crickets continue chirping) (birds chirping) (phone vibrating) (Jordan snoring) (phone continues vibrating) (Jordan continues snoring) (phone continues vibrating) (Jordan continues snoring) (tense music) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (door thuds) (tense music continues) (tense music) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (door rattling) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) - All right, everyone, listen up, listen up. We are one hour out from the biggest closing set in the history of the internet. Now, I just got off the phone with accounting. Donations are at a record high. Pre-saves from Jordan's new single are fucking ticking, huh? - Woo! - Hey, yeah. (group applauding) - Awesome! - Um, real quick, real quick. Personal note. Let me just say it is tremendous what everyone has done to get us here right now. Okay, so let's finish strong. Let's get this new single out into the world, and let's burn the fuckin' house down, right? - Yeah. - Let's go. Let's go. (group applauding) - [Faruq] Come on, guys. - Jordan, can I see you for a moment? - Yeah. (door clicks) What's going on? - Your brother seems to have found a way back from the mountains. He's in the building, isn't he? - Excuse me? - You're going to play the song that the two of you wrote together instead of my single, aren't you? Please, sit. For your sake I'd like to explain what'll happen if you go through with this. (footsteps tapping) What do you know about Dustin Lacey? Your brother. Do you know anything about him? Other than the crazy idea to make the two of you the next musical sensation? Would you like me to fill you in? (soft ominous music) Open it. (Jordan sighs) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) It's one thing to be kidnapped and coerced by a right wing radical. It's quite another thing to uphold his cause deliberately. How long do you anticipate your listeners will support your music after they learn that you're making it with someone like him? Jordan, look at me. (ominous music) Is this why you've been acting out? Because you've been pining to join forces with someone like him? A brother by blood, yes, but a man whose motives you can hardly comprehend. (engine rumbling) (tense music) (door thuds) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) You understand that this will change our relationship. - What? - If you play with Dustin Lacey, his past will come out, and by association it will ruin your public image permanently. Given the important work the public has come to expect from me, I would unquestionably have to create distance between us. - Just like that. - Not intentionally. I want to make that clear. Nothing happens by intention in situations like these. It is simply the way of things. (tense music) - The way of things. (clips rattling) - Jordan, (lid thuds) you're not appreciating the laws of physics in our world today. I mean, one little decision to give someone like him a platform at a major philanthropic event would change everything. One curious search by millions of people all at the same time. The result is seismic in its proportion. His reputation would explode in the media, taking yours with it. And then, if something like this got out to the public, it seals your fate. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) - No, no, no, this was not, this was not me. This was- - That's you. Right there. - Are you fucking... - Putting a gun to your girlfriend's head and pulling the trigger. - This was not, this is bullshit. This is bullshit. - You. - This is fucking bullshit. - You shot your girlfriend, pointblank, then you fled the scene to rendezvous with your radical brother. Do you see the consequences? Do you see how easily things shift and the story falls into place? Jordan. Jordan. You do understand there is no going back. - [Jordan] You would release this? - [Max] If you abandon our song and play against the cause, you would be jeopardizing my efforts for this festival. You would leave me with no choice. The media will find it, and you will drown in an ocean of your followers' reproach. You deviate from the person that Dean is grooming you to become, and you will be canceled forever and disappear like you never existed. - [Jordan] How could you do this to me? - Because it's my organization and we invest in stories that sell, and we must get a return on this investment. As long as you're using my funds, and as long as you're using my platform, I decide what you do as an artist. What you do, what you say, what you think. Is that clear? (door clicks) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (lighter clicks) (ominous music continues) (cigarettes and lighter whoosh) (tense music) (tense music continues) (door thuds) - Ready to go? - You know, a little explanation woulda been nice. - Huh? - You're with a fuckin' hate group? Is that right? - What? - Stop bullshitting me, Dustin. Who the hell are you? Why are you here? - I promise you, Jordan, I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about right now, all right? - There's pictures of you with a group outside of Texas. - So? - You are a pawn in a game. - Jordan. - The bullshit that you are putting me through, this is the most fucking - Jordan. - compromised position of my - Jordan. - fucking life! - Hey, Jordan! - What? - It's a Christian bereavement group for men. - What? - I told you I had a family, right? I had a wife and daughter and they were killed in a car wreck a year and a half ago. So I joined this group through a local church just outside Austin, right up to the point I went lookin' for Dad. Look, man, I didn't tell you because I don't want you to think that I was all fucked up in the head and emotionally unstable and shit, you know, with Dad dyin', too, but I sure as hell ain't in any damn hate group, okay? - You didn't think that the whole kidnapping thing would make me think you're emotionally unstable? You didn't think that? - Well, I mean, it worked, didn't it? - Did it? - Yeah. - No! It didn't fucking work. - Pretty sure it worked, Jordan. What the fuck are you doin'? (ominous music) The fuck is goin' on with you, huh? What's wrong? - It's Romina. - What about her? - She set you up. She's working for Max, dumbass. - (scoffs) What? - Would you let me go? - I'm flushin' this shit. (lid slams) (toilet flushes) (liquid sloshing) - Max had the photos of you, he had the security footage of Raaka, but it wasn't Romina shooting, okay? It was me. He manipulated the fucking video to make it look like it was me. You understand what that means, right? - Well. - It means that he set this whole thing up. - That's a cute story, Jordan, but it's fuckin' impossible. - It's not impossible. He owns everything, man. - It means he was- - Seen this coming, yes, he did. He's known I've wanted out for a very long time. I've made it very clear to him. (sighs) So what'd he do? So he fuckin', he called Raaka, had her come out, set up a frame job, and you played right into it, man. The photos, your video online. You delivered him the perfect fucking story to use against me. - No, Romina and I met a year ago, randomly in the middle of Bumfuck, Texas, all right? And she didn't exactly force her way into my life, Jordan. I mean, you think this guy'd be able to know every decision that I make in an entire year to get me to this weekend? - He's smart. He researches his investments. Just, I am a famous pop star, you are my brother. He planted her to watch you, man. You knew this, Dustin. You knew about Stars for Democracy, and it fuckin' turns out that he knew about you, too. - All this... All this for a song? Yeah. Point taken. - You people and your plans and your games, and I wish none of this shit would've happened. I wish that... - [Dustin] What? - I wish I tried to help Mom. (somber music) Maybe I coulda gotten her out. Maybe we both would've gotten out, none of this shit would've happened, everything would be okay. (somber music continues) (Dustin sighs) - We can't choose what happens to us, all right? All we can do is just move on, just fuckin' move on. This right here, right now, it's your moment. Sure as fuck ain't mine. And it sure as fuck ain't them goddamn pieces of shit. What happens next is your choice. All right, brother? It's fuckin' you, man. (somber music) - Uh... (Jordan exhales) - [Director] All right, all right, everyone settle. Cameras are up. We're goin' live in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6... (timer beeping) (timer beeping) - Wow, incredible numbers! Thank you, thank you, thank you for your generous donations and for making this an incredible weekend. Now, to close out the festival, straight from Los Angeles, the one, the only Jordan Lacey.

Put a lotta work into it. But before we wrap this thing up, I just wanted to say a quick thank you to everybody at home who's been supporting me for the past four years. I guess I haven't really done the best job of being as open about the work that I've been doing, and from now on I'm gonna make sure that the music I put out, I'm thinking about the music I'm putting out, the intention behind it, what it promotes because you guys are the greatest fans in the entire world and you mean the absolute most to me because...

You remember that? I remember that perfectly. That was the dream she traded her life for. But to you she was just, what'd you say? You said she was like a sob story you just happened to be fucking. It was fuckin' sad. Fucked up. But no, I don't wanna just sing. Not my dream. Never been my dream. I wanna live instead. - I'm sorry, Jordan. Jordan. Jordan, I'm so sorry.
