Hola, Javier. Hola. Como estas? Bien. Zeke? You're late. I'm in a hurry. Oh, it's good to see you too, buddy. The chart's are right over there, they're all current. Business has been pretty good, shouldn't have a problem keeping the boat full. I've got eight for you for tomorrow morning. So, be here at 9:00 sharp. Most of my luck's been over at Los Arcos, but then I guess you know your way around the bay. Yeah, I guess I do. I've got no reception in the USA, so you're on your own. Oh, how sad for me. Yeah, yeah. Well, try not to screw things up, okay? Copy that. See you in a couple of months. Alright. Hey, and don't sink the boat. Adios! You still throw like a girl! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What'd you expect, the QE2, huh? Hola! Things must've gotten very bad for you to come back here, huh? It's only temporary. Oh. Good to see you! Good to see you too. You still playing the captain to the rich and the famous? When I can find a ride, you know? What about you? No, no. I'm the man now. Ay, carajo! Ay, carajo! And I need to see your papers. Yeah. That's a good one. No, seriously. I need to see them. Alright, okay. Sorry, bro. El capitan. Things have changed, Trace, you know? You know Calderon, right? Yeah. He doesn't allow any live aboards around the area. Why does Calderon have a say? He's the captain of the Harbor Patrol now. Ah. They're really lowering the bar, huh? Wow! 100 tow master? Yeah. Uh, check it out. Yes? I don't really have anywhere else to stay. You think maybe you could just, like, look the other way for a couple weeks? Trace, Trace, listen. I can't do it. Nah. It's cool. I understand. Look, I-- here. I got something for you. Here you go. Is this a bribe? No, it's a-- It's a late birthday present. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. It's a bit of an aphrodisiac. You mean for the ladies? Yes. Mamacitas. Really? Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you. Don't let Calderon see you. I don't want to lose my job. Dude, I owe you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. Have a beer with me. They're still kind of warm. Ah, doesn't matter. Cheers. Por la redeso. Si, mon. Come on! TV REPORTER: In other news, no further contact with Jeremy Long II, the solo sailor lost last week in the gulf of Alaska. Search and rescue has been terminated due to weather, de. What do you think happened here? Biggest danger for a solo sailor is falling overboard. Yeah. Or going nuts. You two girls swimming to the reef today? Ed Owens spotted a Whale Shark on the north end last week. You be careful, okay? They're harmless. They don't even have teeth. Stay to the south, okay? You promise? Thank you, Luis. Is this the immigration office? I heard you were coming home. Hola, Minina. Que pasa? Como estas? Still keeping me under house arrest. You finally got busted. Oh, please. I'm so sorry. Hey. Hey, look what the cat dragged in. How you doing? I've been running around. You doing alright? Doing good. Doing good. Captain Trace McGraw back from the high seas! Oh, mi loco. How are you, man? I'm good. How's the place looking, huh? Looks good, man. The walls are still standing. Hey, drinks? Yes. No, not for you, man. Come on, man. Let's go sit down. You're gonna make me go bankrupt. Tequila? So, you been busy? Oh, yeah. It's been good, yeah? Carol, meet my friend, Trace. Captain to the Fortune 500. Trace, meet my friend, Carol. Nice to meet you. She came in last year to teach at the international school. Oh, yeah? What do you teach? I teach environmental science with a focus in aquatic ecosystems. Yeah. Big words. Let's drink. Salut! To Trace. Cheers. Gracias. Come on, man. You've always got a story when you come back. What's the adventure this time? Unfortunately, I don't remember her name. No, for real. For reals. Okay. Actually, recently, I was-- I was chased by pirates. Yeah. I was doing a two-month gig. Piloting this boat to Kuala Lumpur. And a pirate ship, speedboat, came up across our bow and actually started firing at us. Next thing I know, they're all on board and I had no choice. I had to rescue the women, and I fired on them with my flare gun and I hit him. Oh, in the ass, huh? Right. In the ass. But they got scared off and they sped out of there. Boss was watching CSPAN the whole time. I'll tell you this much. There is no reward in being a glorified cabin boy. So, I have returned home to make my fortune. Hey, compare, come on. We all know you're not gonna make a fortune out of snorkeling. Si, mon. I guess I will just have to hunt for pirate treasure then. Trace, come on, we all know you. All you're gonna do is rob the local tourists. Come on. Isn't that the idea? Come on. Let's have another drink. Let's do it. Anybody want another drink? Are you sure? ( Cell phone ringing ) Not you, I know how you get. Rita? Sure. Looks like I just lost my first mate. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Salut. To Trace. To Trace. Sure. I'll see you in an hour. Sure. Bye. (phone beeps) Who's running the harbor patrol now. He came by-- Rita? That was Michael Kirshner. Yeah. He wants to meet in an hour regarding the water polo match. I'll give you a call after the meeting, okay? I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. I'll see you afterwards. And don't let him push you around. He's got bigger fish to fry than me. Anyway, thanks so much. I'll try and make it, okay? Bye. Nice to meet you. Okay, well, you guys. I'm off to the beach. Oooh. I just got here. You gonna leave already? Wanna go up to the point and catch up on old times? Yes, I would love to go up to the point and catch up on old times. Um, how's your boyfriend? Woo! Good morning. Um, Carol for Michael? Okay, go ahead. Thank you. Hola! Carol, good to see you. As usual. Thank you. Thanks for rearranging your classes. Of course. Wow. Beautiful, isn't it? So? Yeah, I had this idea about the water polo match. Why don't we do it right here, right in front of the marina? What do you think? Polo on the canal. Great backdrop, right? My girls play in a pool. The channel is-- well, it's just not designed. Carol, listen. We've rearranged the entire program to feature the waterway. Your match will be the grand finale. But you have the boats and-- Don't worry about the boats. I've arranged for all recreational traffic to be shut down during the time of the match. And I've got some patrol boats. So there's no problem. Nothing to worry about. I have to talk to the girls. And I can't see how-- Carol, I'm in a bit of a pinch here. I mean, I can understand your concerns and everything, but I was really hoping you'd go along with me on this. I've already talked to the yacht club coach. They're on board 100 percent. I'd hate to have to have them play against a different team. Oh, the girls would be crushed. Yeah. Okay, okay. We'll make it work. But I want you to promise me you'll get those patrol boats, and I want the safety buoys too. That was easy. Come on, let's go to lunch. Oh, yes. Donde? This is Search and Rescue, X-Ray, Tango, 6-4 niner hailing all vessels. We have distress signal located near Los Muertos reef. Please proceed immediately to that location. Diving champ, biology major, Princeton grad. It does beg the question. How did you end up working here? Sentimental reasons, I guess. My parents had a fellowship at Marine Institute in the '80s. Scientists. Both of them. They studied climate change here for a year. Can I interest you in any dessert, coffee, anything? No, thank you. I'm fine. I'll take an apple pie and a coffee. Thanks. Say, Carol, I was thinking maybe after the regatta, you and I get together for a drink? Oh, no, no. It's not what you're thinking. To be honest, it is a proposition, but, I wonder if you're interested in coming to work here at Paradise Village as a social director? It's, uh, a job at a family resort. You're good with kids. Good fit, right? Can I think it over? The drinks or the job? Maybe both. Well, look at the time. I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have to go. Thank you for lunch, Mike. Carol, this is a serious job offer. I really want you to consider this. I will. I'll keep in touch. Hi, this is Rita. Please leave me a message. Thank you. Rita. Carol here. Hey, let me know where you are at the beach, okay? Bye. So, the match. The field will be laid out exactly the same. Except the goalie won't be able to touch the bottom. Egg beater as long as you can. We'll substitute every ten minutes, okay? Okay. Alright, girls. Give me a sprint to the goal, then the dry pass drill. Come on. Here! Here! Nice catch. Janelle, that's a foul! She should watch the ball. You should watch your passing and your temper. Emily, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Don't let her throw you off your game. You're doing great. Hey, what's the matter with you, Janelle? That's enough for the day. Shower up. Oh, not today, thanks. Okay. Watch your step. There you go. You did good. Good job. Cheers. MAN: Thanks a lot, man. Gracias. Don't forget, we like the tips that jingle but we love the tips that fold. Hola. Hey, Carol the Aquatic Eco-coach. Trace, the embellished pirate. What brings you down here? I was hoping Rita was here. I was supposed to meet up with her, but I can't find her. Bienvenido a Mexico. Don't take it personal. That's just Rita. Maybe, but she was going for a swim. You don't think I should be worried? No, I'm sure she's fine. I'm actually gonna go and pick up some supplies, so if I see her, I'll tell her to give you a call. Okay. Maybe I'll drive down to the beach and see if I can find her too. I'm telling you, she's fine. Okay. Adios. Adios. Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard, what is your location, over? Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard, this is Mexican Search and Rescue, over? Please continue on a heading of 20 degrees north by 105 degrees west, over? I don't see anything. Search and Rescue, this is Vallarta lifeguard. We are approaching the reef but there is nothing here. I repeat, there is nothing here. Roger that. Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard, this is Mexican Search and Rescue, over? Please confirm your location as 20 degrees north by 105 degrees west, over? Roger that. I can't make it out. Here, take a look over there. Just below the surface. See it? What-- what is that thing? I don't see it? Where'd it go? Try to find it. Check over the bow. I got back here. It's not up here, man. I can't see it. What the-- Look out! Help me! Reach for my hand! I got ya! Come on, man! Kick! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Los Muertos Reef, Mayday! Trace, you're talking crazy, man. I'm telling you, okay? This was not a shark, okay? A shark does not eat a lifeguard boat. A shark does not have horns-- Hey, carnada. I know you're upset about what you saw, but-- Luis? Hey. Why are you closed? Trace is having a bad day. He saw two lifeguards get attacked by a tiger shark. It was not a tiger shark! Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I still can't find Rita and I'm starting to get worried. Oh, don't worry about her. You want some water? Please. ...bringing his clients up close and personal with the sharks. Scranton has been chumming the waters around Los Muertos Reef, which Captain Calderon believes led to the fatal attack of two lifeguards and a local woman, Rita Valdez. Oh, my God. Police Chief Captain Calderon thanked Doctor Frank Reeves for helping identify the cause of the threat. Next up, Randy Johnson with sports. This wasn't a shark. Trace, just stop, alright? What are you talking about? I've sailed on this bay half my life. I know what a damn tiger shark looks like. I'm going to find this thing that killed my friend. Trace? I'm coming with you. Rita was my first friend here. Yeah. Mine too. She looked up my birthday and threw me a surprise party at Luis' bar. I didn't know a soul. But that's how friends were made according to Rita. Seems like everybody's got a story like that about Rita. What's yours? She fed me. I guess I was the, uh, the poor kid with no lunch money. So everyday, Rita would come to school with an extra lunch. It was the first time that I... tasted food made with love. That thing is still out there. Until we can prove it, not Luis, not the news channels, not Calderon, nobody's gonna believe us. I need your help. Well, here we are. Come on. Let me show you around. Great. Wow. There is a certain "wow" factor. What a wonderful place. So peaceful and private. How about a drink? You've really got this down, don't you? Thank you. My pleasure. Viva la fiesta. And to think it was snowing when I left Aspen. Is that your boat? What, that old thing? Yeah. Will you take me for a ride sometime? Sure, no problem. Let's go for a dip first. Work up an appetite for lunch. Oh, I don't need to eat. Oh, looking at you, neither do I. No. No. Steve, Steve, I'm serious. I do not want to get my bathing suit wet. No? What're you waiting for? The pool deck at the Paradise. I am gonna get you for this! I'm gonna get you! There's something down here. What? Help. Oh, come on, Lois. You're not getting up that easy. No, Steve. Help! Help! Lois! You really know these waters, don't you? I sort of grew up down here. I spent more time in the water than I did in school. My dad was stationed at the U.S. Navy base down here, so. Didn't follow in his footsteps? Not exactly. I was at Annapolis. My father's pride and joy. I don't know. Something just didn't click. I dropped out a year later. Father hasn't talked to me since. Where is he now? Somewhere in the States, I hear. I'm sorry. Oh, nothing to be sorry for. Not that it's any of my business, but, some people-- well, parents-- have a hard time adapting to how they thought things would be to how they are. I didn't exactly take you for the black sheep in the family type. You'd be surprised how high expectations can be set. The only thing I've learned to expect lately is bad news. What about your pot of gold? I'm still looking for it. You see that? What is it? I don't know. It's right here on the starboard side. Just keep the boat pointed right. What is it? It's called an EPERB. It's an emergency response beacon that's triggered by water. If your boat sinks, it sends out a distress signal with your GPS coordinates. Every boat has one. Does it say what boat it's registered to? It's got all this residue on it. Hold on, hold on. here, let me see it. Be my guest. Fin Seeker, this is Mexican Search and Rescue, over? In regards to your previous inquiry, the EPERB belongs to the sailboat that disappeared off the coast of Alaska, over? Repeat that. Did you say Alaska? Over. Affirmative. Strange. Got the same signal just before the lifeguards disappeared. I have no idea how it got this far south. Can you bring it by headquarters when you get a chance? Over. Roger that. Over and out. Alaska? That's a long way. Yeah, it's a long way. That's it. That's what I saw. I found it on Dr. Reeves' website. Trace, these creatures have been extinct for over 150 million years. Well, I guess you didn't get the memo, because that's what I saw. Are you suggesting this species survived? You're the scientist. Suppose it did survive, just for the sake of the argument. A mutation more sustainable to warmer waters could be making it's way south. This came from that boat that vanished in Alaska. Now, five days later, they picked up its signal here, okay? That's 1600 miles. You think this thing attacked Jeremy Long's boat? Yeah. And it swallowed his emergency beacon. Then headed south to warmer waters. But it couldn't digest the beacon, so it regurgitated it. So how do we kill it? We have to go to the authorities with this. And tell them what? As far as they're concerned, this case is closed. I'll talk to Dr. Reeves about it. He worked with my father. Dr. Reeves will hear me out. And he will think you are as crazy as I am. I'll take that chance. I'm gonna need this. The residue might be a bile from its stomach. Dr. Reeves can sequence the DNA and confirm that this thing exists. Trace, promise me you won't do anything until I've had a chance to talk to him. Trace. Alright. Carol. Thanks. Dr. Reeves. Carol Brubaker. You spoke at my class last month. I remember. Carl Brubaker's daughter. I always enjoyed his lectures. I'm also a friend of Rita Valdez, a woman killed at Los Muertos. I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time. Of course. Give me a moment. Follow me. Trace recognized it immediately as the creature he saw. Carol, this is just an artist's rendering. It's on your website. Yes. But it's just another unconfirmed sighting. There have been others? Japan. New Zealand. North Carolina. But until we have a reliable record of the existence of this species, something concrete, we can not assume the existence of a living example. This is the beacon I told you about. It may have tissue from the creature on it. Examine this, please, Dr. Reeves. I will. Trace, you promised. Stop your engines. Prepare for boarding. I repeat. Stop your engines. Stop your engines. The engine is stopped. Okay, I hear you. The engine is stopped. Nothing changes with you, does it, McGraw? I know it's very sad. Entiendo. Hey, you want to explain to me why you were doing ten times the speed limit through a no-wake zone? Ah, no, actually, I don't. How about the registration for that weapon? Look, Victor-- I'm very happy for your promotion. I'm glad to see that they're lowering their standards so much. As much as I'd like to stay here and insult you some more, I'm kind of busy right now. Oh, can we get you any ammunition? Huh? How about some fuel? Look, Victor, this thing-- Yup. This thing that killed Rita and the lifeguards, It's not just a shark, okay? It's some kind of prehistoric shark, like a dinosaur. What the hell are you talking about? This thing is out there and it's heading for the waterways. I saw it, okay? I'm not kidding, alright? If we don't stop this thing, it's gonna kill a lot more people. How long are you going to carry on with this? Those people were attacked by a tiger shark! No! I have a warrant to search this vessel. Search it for what? You leave that to us. You know what, go ahead. Search the boat. Fine! Be my guest. You've got bigger problems than a prehistoric fish, amigo. Turns out your partner was arrested at the border with 40 pounds of marijuana. Can you explain that? What partner? He's not my partner! I rent his boat! Okay, that's it! Now I'm impounding this boat. Okay? Ernesto, get this fool off the deck and onto dry land. Yeah, good luck getting on board. Alright, calm down. This is not a contact sport. Come on, let's go! Alright. Are you kidding me? What? Oh-- Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Alright, let's get out of here! Come on. Alright, babe. Alright, you be up front, I'm in back. All you got to do is just row and I'll match you, okay? No big deal. Here we go. One, two, perfect. Alright, paddle, paddle. Right on. I have got this. Okay. And what is it that you're doing back there, babe? I'm trying to match your stroke. Isn't that supposed to be my line? Come on! Left, right, left, right. Don't make me come back there. Just keep in rhythm with me. Listen here, mister! Whoa! You're rocking the boat. Tom, I think we're being followed. It's probably just a dolphin. I don't know. It looks kind of big for a dolphin. That's no dolphin. That's a shark. Now row! Row! Come on! Oh my God! No! No! Hey! How are you? You guys are looking great. Good to see you. Hello. Good to see you again. Sam. Nice to see you once more. Thank you for your hospitality. Very good. Hello. Simon! Ah, Frank. Frank, good to see you again. I'm glad you could make it. Thanks for inviting me. Let me introduce you to somebody. Sure. Elsa? Yes! This is Dr. Simon Otis, a distinguished colleague of mine. Well, welcome, Dr. Otis. I'm so glad you're joining us this evening. Simon is with us doing some research on cryobiotics. I'll let him explain. I study organisms living at below-normal temperatures. Endangered fish. Endangered fish! Excuse me one moment. I'm so sorry that the music is so loud, but we are having our annual fiesta and I'm so glad you're joining us for this event. Yes, well, it's nice to be here. Amigos, you're music is great, but could you hold the volume down just a little bit? Some arctic species develop anti-freeze proteins that bind to the ice crystals in the fish. Frank. Very interesting, Dr. Otis, it's been such a pleasure meeting you. Nice to meet you. I must say hello to your wife. I'll join you later. I was just telling her about Siberian sturgeon and how I was trying to freeze the DNA for future regeneration. I was going to-- Simon, come with me for a moment. I need your opinion about something. Okay. There's been something bothering me for some time. Checking up on this. I'm not really certain as to what the answer is. But do you think it's possible that a prehistoric species could survive in this way? Trapped in ice. I think it's highly improbable. But out of the question? No. Where's Trace? I can't get him on his cell. I don't know. Probably got some last-minute customer or something. He's out there looking for the pliosaur, I know it! Hello! Hello? Hey, Carol, it's Mike. Listen, the Regatta Fiesta Parade thingy-- is going to be happening a little later than anticipated. So I was wondering if we could delay the polo match until 3:00? Sure. No problem. Okay. I'll tell the yacht club coach. Okay. Is that it? Well, not unless you want to take me up on my offer. Dinner, tonight? Look. I don't know how to explain this to you, Mike, but I just can't deal with this right now, okay? No, I totally understand that. I mean, tomorrow night's good if you're available. Argh! Naylea, doing anything tomorrow night? Hello! Where are you? I'm coming. It's Trace. He's down at the dock. Luis, that thing is in the canal. Everything was peaceful around here until Trace McGraw came back. You still don't believe him? Did you? I believe what he saw was a pliosaur. I believe he saw it go to inland waters and we've got to stop it. And I believe you guys are going to need my help. This is Steve's house here. We should warn him. Yeah, there's a good view of the canal from his dock. Steve! Hey, Steve! Steve! Steve! I don't see him. It looks like he hooked another one. Yeah, looks like it. Steve! Hey, Steve! It's real. Just like you said. Where the hell is it headed for now? Let's go. And that leads to the Bacanas, you know, that's where it's headed. How far is it? 12 miles. But there's a pontoon barrier at the Watuka turnoff. We can stop it there. Then what? Blow it out of the water. Whoa. This creature is a biological phenomenon. So-- We should capture it somehow, anesthetize it. Study it. We'll get it mounted on your wall, if you want. After we kill it. I like his idea better. So what, we need explosives, right? Yeah. I'll try to get some from my friends at the army base. Alright, make it happen. We'll take Steve's car. You guys track the thing. I'll meet you at the barrier. Papa? Not now! What is it? You need to take this. Yeah. Inspector Calderon, it's Carol Brubaker. There's been another shark attack with two more victims. Where? 33 Villa del Sol. At least two people. Steve Loggins and a woman. There's not much left to I.D. We're tracking the thing inland. We're going to try and stop it at Watuka turnoff. You've got to send some help right away. Immediately. It's for sure. So he said he's sending someone. This better work. Pedro! Hey, guys! Came to visit your old friend? How long is it gonna take you to get that pontoon piece into place? Pedro, please can you get that crane running? I was waiting for-- Pedro, no esta bromeando. Look, I'm not joking, man, we gotta get that thing down there, okay? Just move it, come on! Okay, okay. Let's go! Be careful. Okay. Pedro, keep bringing it down. Watch your step. Right here. Come on! Okay, that's good! So what's the plan? There are eyelets on either side of this pontoon that lock it into place. Once they're together, this thing shouldn't be able to get through. So how are you going to do that? Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to go underneath there. What am I supposed to do? Just make sure I don't get eaten. That's not funny. Okay, take it up! Come on. You got it? Almost. I just need to catch my breath. Carol? Carol! Got to hurry. Last call. Carol! Carol! Come on! It's coming. Carol, come on! Carol, come up! Carol! Get her out, man! Carol! Get up. Come on. It's coming. Get out. Hey! Hey, come on! We got it trapped inside here. It's inside the canal. Hey. You're just in time, okay-- Okay. Stay back. What are you doing? Victor, listen to me. We have it trapped. Right here in the canal, okay? Oh, yeah? It's right back there. Really? How scary. Listen to me-- Listen to me, Trace! You show up out of nowhere. The next thing I know, I've got four people dead. And a missing car and a brick of marijuana from your boat. to do, huh?trapped I want you to stop this thing. You want me to pin it on a dinosaur? Is your dinosaur running weed, too? Oh, my God! Fire now! Whoa! That's your killer. A 150 million year-old shark. And it's hungry. We need to trap it, this thing. Okay, the waterway leads to a maze of canals and then the swamp. Canals lead to the estuary and the estuary leads to the open ocean, so this thing can still get free. Yeah, but the mascaro is only a few boat lengths wide. I need shallow. I've got a chopper. We can spot it from the air and blow his thing back into the Stone Age. Ernesto, go to base now. Yes, sir. And clear the park. Dinoshark season is officially open. Hey, you see that boat? I'm gonna take that boat, okay? I'll meet you-- Look, Trace, I want you to stay out of the way, okay? Leave it us. That chopper's got a 50 caliber machine gun. No arguing with that, man. We have the shark spotted right below. You're gonna need a bigger chopper, cabrón. Crazy! You're crazy! Come on. Carol. Luis, where are you? Via Escondido. I'm stuck at a federal checkpoint. I can't get through. He's stuck on Escondido. Tell him it's in the park national. We can meet him at Punta del Flamingo. He'll know where it is. Yeah, I got it. I'll be there in 30. You've got to hurry, Luis. I'm bringing it a little present, too. How do you find your way around here. It all looks the same. I told you, I grew up here. Luis and I used to come down here when we were kids and play hooky. If I remember, this should lead us to Punta del Flamingo. Ah, it's nice. I'm not wearing the right shoes for this. Alright, alright, we gotta stop. This is good. You want to take a break? Right here's great. Let's get some water out. Sure. Open it up. Hey, Dad, can I go play by the water? Sure. Just be careful. Don't get wet, buddy. Okay. Okay. Just be really careful, okay? Hold still. Oh, thanks. Wow, it's hot. Can't wait to get on that boat. You see anything? Up there, what's that? Get out of here, you stupid crocodile. It's hot. What's wrong with you? Huh? Eddie, where's your boat? Well, there was this crocodile in the water and this monster ate him. Look, we've got the whale-watching trip. We need to go. Come on, hustle up. I have talked to you about this. No more stories. Trace! Carol! Trace! Hey! Let's go. It was right here taking a sunbath. Calderon's men shot at it 50 times. He just flew over. It can fly? Hey! Which way? That way. Let's go. Hello and welcome. As you can see, the boats are getting ready for what promises to be a fantastic day of fun at the marina. Awesome! We have, in fact, imported the lovely ballet folklore dancers. And I hope you enjoy that. And, oh! Look who we have here. George. George, how you doing, sir? Good to see you. Hi, Mike. How you doing? Nice to see you too! Bill, if you'll have a seat there, please? Barbara, I reserved a special seat for you. From here, you should have a pretty good view of the match. Hurricane Tina slammed this place pretty hard. It washed out most of the waterways. You guys, this map is out of date. Now what? What's that? At least they got their wildlife adventure. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the start of the 2009 Puerto Vallarta Regatta "Race For the Cup." Hey, Luis, isn't that the main channel? We're headed toward the ocean. Trace! Trace, right there, do you see it? It's headed towards the hotel. The girls! I've seen you guys before and I know-- Did you hear we're going to be playing in the bay? Hey! You can't be in here. What do you mean, I own the joint. Have you seen Miss Brubaker? We thought she was with you. The match starts in six minutes. We can't play without a coach. How could she let me down like this? We were hitting it off so well. Wait. We could do it. We practice the plays all week. Janelle, you can lead the swim-off. Monica, you can start on goal. Let's show these yahoo girls how to play ball. Alright. Let's go! Ladies and gentlemen, Paradise Village proudly presents, a brand new Fiesta Week event. An all-girl water polo match. Let's make a goal. Keep passing. Janelle, get the ball on this side! All right, Janelle! They've started! Get out of the water! Shark! Shark! Shark? Who? What? Help me! Get out! Get out of the water! Help. Help me! Please, help her! Come on, girls! Oh my God! Minina, come on! Minina, swim to the ladder, please! Come on! Come on, you can do this! I can't. Come on. You can do this. Carol! We're almost there. Luis! No! Give me your hand! Carol, come on. She's over here. Carol, come on, we gotta get this thing. Carol? Carol! Come on. What's going on? It's going to be okay. Reeves, no, look, it's too late, okay? Just tell me how to kill this thing. The creature's exterior laminate is armor. The only vulnerability in the entire skeleton is the orbital cavity. In English, Reeves! The eye! Aim for the eye. Okay. Reeves thinks this thing's only weakness is the eye. It's headed for Paradise Beach. Got it! Oh! Nice! Go, Trina! You go, girl. Race you to the barrier. You're on! I'll catch up with you later. I've got an appointment with the parasailor. Jet ski, windsurfing, parasailing. Bye bye! Woo! It's gone. Out of the water! This is Paradise Village, people. Before we get to the viewing area, folks, this is a fine opportunity to take in the sight of the Bahita Day Fun Dance. And off to the starboard side, you guys can see the world-famous Puerto Vallarta Regatta. Take a picture, it'll be worth a lifetime of memories. And if you look above us right now, you will see an example of the exciting sport of parasailing. I bet he has a view to die for. Keep your eyes open and cameras ready, folks, because we might just catch a glimpse of a dolphin or two. Hey, Skipper, how about a lift? What do you say, mates, hard to say no to these mermaids. Come aboard. Okay, watch your step here, my little fish. Whoa! Holy smoke! Hey! Hey! There's a shark behind you! Get out of the water! There's a shark behind you! There's a shark right behind you! Right behind you! Get out of the water! Trace, he got the parasailor! Right over there! Go, go, go! Take the wheel. Get as close to it as you can. I don't think this boat can keep up! Keep it straight! Carol, keep it steady! I'm trying! Damn it! Is that a shark? It just hit the excursion boat! Over there! Eddie? Mom! Eddie! Mom! It's right behind them. The boat's not fast enough! Mommy! Carol! Get me over to that Jet Ski! Closer! I'm trying. Help me. Come on, Trace. Help! Help me! Help! Help us! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Welcome to the Endangered Species list, you bastard.
