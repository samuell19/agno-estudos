Please turn off your cell phone. This is your captain speaking. We are experiencing turbulence. Return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts until further notice. You should have a drink, it helps. - Pardon ? - Hate to fly ? Don't fly sober. I wish I could, but I have an important business meeting. God, that sounded kinda stuffy, didn't it ? What kind of business meeting ? I'm a project developer. For a large real estate company. You're not an evil developer that tears down our forests and replaces them with tacky mini-malls with Starbucks cafes ? Yeah, pretty much. Karl Brendt, Evil Developer. Coco Meduza. I've flown over a thousand times and still I'm shaking like a leaf. Driving a car is more dangerous. I think what frightens you is that you don't trust others. - And you're scared of losing control. - It isn't that... you can't get out ! I prefer trains. You can pull the emergency brake. But earlier today I had to be in Berlin. You need to release your fears. - Know what helps ? - No, I haven't got a clue. Passionate sex. Heard of the Mile High Club ? - Damn it. - What ? I've thought about this since my brother gave me his Penthouse collection. So ? Happy ? But I will always remember this moment for the rest of my life. DON'T. GET. OUT ! I never travel with luggage, I only bring carry-ons ! But I was forced to check it in Munich. Now my carry-on is lost ! I understand. I can file a lost baggage report. But I assure you 95% of the lost luggage is found within 48 hours. That doesn't help at all ! Look, it's our anniversary. Fifteen years. My wife thinks I'm on a train from Munich and I'm trying to surprise her. - Please ma'am, if you could just... - I'm sorry, Mr. Brendt. The plane's already been cleaned and loaded for the next flight. Today is April 1st and we're in for some rough weather here in Berlin, so be sure to drive carefully out there. Wednesday morning we'll have plenty of sunshine over of Berlin-Brandenberg. Later in the day, there will be a chance of rain with some thunderstorms. - Are you nuts ? It's not even six. - Sorry it's important. - Is it the Schwabinger building ? - No, it's okay. Is Ida awake ? - Doubt it. - Morning ! - You alright ? - It's Simone's and my... anniversary. Oh God, keep me out of this. I'll see you at work ! - And you need a gift ? - Got lost on the plane. - I'll me get dressed and get the key. - Thanks. - Good morning ! - Mom thought you'd be here later. - That's a surprise. - Cool. - I saw you on television ! - Wasn't that on a little late ? I recorded it, look. - Josefine, Marius ! Did you eat ? - Almost finished mom. Hurry, I don't want to be late ! Marius, I'll watch it later, let me say hi to mom. Of course, Mr. D'Angelo. I'll have an answer later today. Bye ! - Thought you were on the train. - You look gorgeous. Yeah ? Fuck ! That's great... Can you get the kids ready ? I have to leave in five minutes. Okay. Shit ! Hello ? Karl, our clients are nervous about the Schwabing project. There's nothing to worry about. - So there won't be a building freeze ? - No. - And the underground parking issue ? - I'm on it. If it's not under control, costs will go through the roof. I need a strategy to appease investors. The press is already asking questions. Shit. My meeting's been cancelled. I can be in the office in half an hour. You're the best, Karl. Shit. Our construction projects will always, fit into the existing cityscape. Dad, look, there you are ! - Enjoying that ? - What ? You two, grab your stuff and let's get going. I got this. Go ! Hello ? Hey, my little brother ! Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for remembering. Listen, I'm on my way out so I'll call you back. See ya ! Since when do you sit in the back voluntarily ? You've got a lover, you've... - Dad ! - You two stop it. But she hit me in the head ! I guess you're even now. Why's your ball in here ? It's for after school. - It smells in here. - Because you need a shower. Listen, I need to make a phone call. I'd appreciate it if you didn't fight for two minutes, okay ? Let's go. - Karl, wait ! - Mom's angry. - What's going on ? - I'm taking the kids to school today. I'll do it. So you don't have to rush to your appointment. I begged you last week to help me today but you told me it was impossible. Remember ? Now you appear out of nowhere acting like the perfect father. My plans changed. Now I can drop them off on my way to work. Because now it's convenient for you. What about when my plans change ? Or the children's ? - Gimme a break. I was trying to help ! - Yeah, you just ruined my morning. No ! Don't bother. - Happy Anniversary, dear. - What ? I saw Berlin back in the nineties and it was great. But because times are changing, places are changing and growing. That's what makes them special and unique. - Hello ? - Feeling more rested ? - Yes, what's up ? - Rocher called me. At this hour ? What did he want ? The press caught wind of the readmission notice. If the Schwabing protesters find out, they're gonna use it to their advantage. You must sit down with the architects and lawyers to work on the notice. - I will, don't worry. - What can I do, Karl ? Meet me at the office ? We might need to sign off on some documents. I knew becoming your boss was going to be a hassle. - Should've turned it down. - And leave this shit to you ? What's ringing, Dad ? - How soon can you get to the office ? - I'll be late today. Ida has a doctor's appointment and I promised I'd go with her. Ask her to reschedule. Or I tell Rocher it was a mistake to promote you. Alright, calm down. I'm on my way. What is that ? Is this your mother's ? Yeah ? Weren't you curious as to why your car door wasn't locked ? - Who the hell is this ? - You're an asshole, Karl. I bet you have no idea how much of a scumbag you really are. What is this ? What do you want ? Exactly ! That's what this is all about. What I want. And the sooner you understand, the better. If you think this is the first time I've been harassed by protesters... Shut up and listen ! I couldn't care less about your ugly houses. You and your children are sitting on a bomb. It will explode if any of you... Yeah, right. Did you tell your boyfriend you were making out with a senior ? No, but I am telling him you still wet the bed. Mom said you're not allowed to joke about that ! Who said I was joking ? Bed-wetting is very serious. It's no laughing matter. That's why I'm going to text the whole school and ask for help. I'm sure someone will be able to help you with your situation. - You're lying ! - No, I'm not. Show me what you wrote then ! Let me see ! - Give it ! - No ! Give me the phone ! Fool, don't you hang up on me again. I've got a remote detonator. If any of you leave your seat, boom ! If you hang up, boom ! - All with the push of a button. - What do you want ? I've got my kids with me. - If this is a joke I'll... - This is far from a joke. I want money. No ! - Stop, no ! - You almost killed us, Dad ! - Stay right where you are ! - Don't take your fight with Mom on us ! Listen, no matter what, do not get out of your seats. Please. I didn't send that text, I was only teasing. Are you ready to listen now ? I want my money. - How much ? - 67 547 Euro in cash. And 450 000 wired to the offshore account in your glove compartment. That's ridiculous, I can't get that much money right away. Dad, we'll be late. We don't carry that much cash in the office. I can't wire an amount this large without my associates signing off on it. - What you're asking for is impossible. - Don't bullshit me, Karl. I know there's plenty of money in your company's account and you're capable of moving much larger sums. - Not without my partners' approval. -Then get them. It's not the first time. Let's talk money. Withdraw 67 547 Euro from your personal account. - I don't have that much money... - You have 1 768 Euro in your account. 5 779 in your wife's and 60 000 in your savings account. That's 67 547. Don't underestimate me again, Karl. Hold on. This is between you and me, let's leave my kids out of it . You and your children won't get out of there alive ! Unless you do exactly what I say. Alright, I'll get you the cash. But there must be another way to... Quit stalling and listen ! Start working on getting the money or I'll set off the detonator now ! - Dad, we're here ? - You're passing up the entrance ! - I don't have access to that much ! - Stop dad ! You really are an asshole, Karl. Of course you don't. - Finally, I'm out of here. - You worthless piece of shit ! - You're locking us in ? - I said don't get out of your seats. Do what I say and stay where you are. Could listen to me for once ? - Why do we have to sit here ? - Go on, tell them ! - Trust me on this one, please. - Yeah, right. Sit down ! Listen. The man on the phone told me that under our car seats... There is a bomb. And if we get up, it'll explode. It's April Fool's, right ? Yeah, it's probably a bad psycho joke. But let's just play it safe anyway. Just be patient. It's a YouTube prank ! I'm sure an evil clown will show up ! - Just do what I say ! - Shouldn't we call the police then ? If you call the police, or one cop shows up anywhere near that car, boom ! Be reasonable. First I'd have to be in the office and then I'd have to... Let's start with your 67 547 Euro. - Most of it is in my wife's account... - Karl ! Think. - You can't leave that car anyway. - So how can I get the... Prove to me you love your children. This shouldn't be too difficult. - Put him on speakerphone. - Josefine, please ! You're the problem solver of the company. Think ! I'm waiting. This picture, where did it come from ? It was mom's profile picture from last year, how could you not know that ? Hey Marius ! Show us the bomb. Where is it ? Dad, that's Ramon. The best player on our team. - Yesterday, he scored seven goals. - Why are they here ? I texted Jan. But only him. I told him not to tell anyone. I bet he's lying. Come on, show us ! Who is that ? Marius was just fooling around, there is no bomb. - Told ya ! - Go. Marius will see you later ! He lied to us ! But there is a bomb ! - Now they're gonna hate me. - Mom will be mad we're absent. - What's going on Karl ? - I'm thinking how to get the money. My patience is wearing real thin, Karl. Tick, tock. "Write mom to call the police..." - What are you doing ? - I must make some phone calls. I can't do that while I drive. Alright fine. Make the calls. But I want to hear everything. "Write mom to call the police... No uniforms, no patrol cars !" Good morning, I.M.P.P. Building Development, this is Miriam. - Hello Miriam, it's me. - Great. Rocher wanted to speak to you but I didn't want to ruin your anniversary. I already spoke to him earlier, but... Calling for a different reason. I can't get into the office. - Marius had a bike accident. - God ! He's alright, but I'll take him to the hospital anyway. Do me a favor. It's about Simone's Franchise License. - She might've mentioned it to you ? - Possibly. There's a competitor. She needs to buy now. Simone will use the money from the personal account, as well as our joint account. And she'll need to use some from mine. How much is that ? About 68 grand. But it's a great investment. You have my authorization. Meet Simone at the bank. Give her... - Give her everything in my account. - All of it ? Yeah ! I gotta get Marius to the hospital and Simone can't miss this chance ! Karl, is everything okay ? Yeah... everything is fine. - It's sure hot outside, isn't it ? - Hot ? At this time of year ? Don't try to bullshit me Karl ! No, I was just... Miriam, that's our code for everything's fine, remember ? Of course. I was worried for a second. If you had said, "cold"... - Get to the bank as soon as you can. - Okay. - Can you get me Omar ? - He said he'd be in a little later. Okay. Thanks. You don't trust each other enough to withdraw money from your accounts ? - I gotta pee. - I'm calling my wife now. I always go as soon as I get to school. The person is unavailable. Please leave a message. Simone, I know you're mad, but please call me. It's important. Please call me back. - Problems with your beloved wife ? - She'll call. I have to make another call. For the transfer. - For my 450 000, right ? - Yeah. I'm calling my boss. He's also a friend. He'll help. - He'll help. His name's Omar Cicek. - I know. Go ahead. Call him now. - Karl ! - Omar. A guy on the phone says he put a bomb in the car and I got my kids with me. - Karl... - Let me finish ! I don't know if he's serious but I need you to allow me to make a transfer. - It's a lot, but I'll pay it back... - Karl, he called me, too. - Where are you ? - In my car. Ida's with me. Karl, what's going on ? Ida, everything's okay... Don't worry. We must stay calm. Otherwise we'll lose control. - I got you now asshole ! - Dad, are you crazy ? - If we die, you're coming with us ! - You could have killed him ! - Asshole ! - What are you doing ? What is happening ? - David ! I know him from school ! - Josefine ? Dad almost ran over Josefine's kissing friend ! David, I'm so sorry ! You still don't understand who you're dealing with. I will kill you Karl. You and your children will die if you don't do what I say. I'm freaking out, I wasn't paying attention, it was just an accident. Stay in your seats ! - Karl, what are you doing ? - Nothing, I'm just driving. - I know, there's a GPS on the phone. - Josefine, call your mother. - You call her. - Call your mother, please ! This is so sick. You're going crazy. Dad ? Dad ! - What ? - I have to use the bathroom ! - Just go in your pants. - Pretend that you're in bed. Was that your boyfriend or the one you're cheating on him with ? - It went to voicemail. - Call her at the university. - The number ? - I don't know, Google it ! - Are you okay ? - Karl, what the hell is this about ? - I'm not sure, but it'll be okay. - We can't meet his demands. We'll figure it out. I put in a request for the transfer, but it's way over my limit. We need our partners to sign for more than 50 000 ! I can sign for the first 50 000. What the hell you doing in the middle of the street ? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Piss off ! Listen. So we'll have at least the first 50 grand ? Hang on a second. Come on, get out of there ! - Do you know that guy ? - No way. Maybe it's nothing and we'll go viral, but we can't take that chance. That's what I told him too, Karl. It's just an April Fool's joke. - Be careful Karl, you're on thin ice. - C'mon you idiot, go ! Karl, I was scared, so I gave him our passwords. - Omar, we'll figure it out, just... - This is my parking spot, asshole ! - Sir, I beg you, get out of here ! - Why ? - Find another parking space. - Get outta the car ! Please, get out of here ! - Even Karl thinks it's fake. - Wait, we don't know for sure. Ida ! - What ? - You are not leaving this car ! - It's probably just a prank ! - You don't know that ! - Get me to the doctor. - Ida, stop what are you doing ? - Karl, please tell her not to get out ! - Ida, no ! Don't get out ! Ida, please stay in. We don't know for sure if this is fake. Ida, wait ! Maybe you're right. But how do we know ? It's just too big of a risk ! Better to look like idiots than risk our lives. The likelihood that someone put bombs in our cars is low, but what if it isn't ? Please. I beg you, stay in your car. Please, Ida. Wait, I see an empty spot. - Karl, what's our next move ? - We'll do whatever this guy says. - You're both idiots. Taxi ! - Ida ! - Marius, Josefine, are you alright ? - Go, before the police show up. - Now ! - It's okay... Marius, say something ! It's okay if you wet your pants. It isn't pee. Dad ? Marius ? Marius... - Dad ! - No, it hurts, don't touch it ! Did you stop ? - My son is hurt, you son of a bitch ! - Mind your manners. And you fucking killed Omar and Ida ! - Focus on getting me my money. - They were completely innocent ! They were my friends ! How could you do that ? Shut your mouth or you'll be next ! You told that slut this whole thing was nothing. So their blood is on your hands. Please ! My son is badly hurt, he's bleeding. It's his leg. Quit whining and get me my money. Marius, I have to tie this around your leg. Leave it alone, it hurts ! Stop it, please ! Oh God. It's okay now Marius. - What the hell are you doing ? - It's ok. I've got you. I'm talking to you ! Where are you going ? Where the hell do you think you're going ? - I'm getting my son to ER. - No, I can't allow that. It's alright Marius, this is gonna help stop the bleeding, okay ? Stop, Karl ! Are you hard of hearing ? If you don't stop on the count of three, you'll end up like your friends. - One, two, three... - No ! - Good-bye, Karl. - Okay, okay ! - My son could die ! - I'll make you a deal Karl. Get me the 67 547 Euro in cash first and your son can go to the hospital. - I'll still be able to play soccer ? - Yes, Marius, of course you will. I just have to take care of something and then we'll go to the hospital. Why'd we stop ? Don't worry, everything's going to be fine. Here take this. And press it on the wound. We'll get the man his money and then... He'll let us go to the hospital. Dad, what does he want from us ? I don't understand why this is happening and why is our picture on that phone ? - What did you do wrong now ? - Nothing ! He's blackmailing me because my company has a lot of money. Bullshit, nothing is ever your fault ! I don't hear you talking to your wife. I can't reach her. Where do you think she could be ? She's got a job interview. Her phone is probably turned off right now. Karl, you really don't know, do you ? - What ? - God, you are such an idiot. I don't understand. Your money, career, family, your marriage, all of it is built on lies. Why don't you ask your daughter where your wife is ? Josefine, where's your mother ? Please. Where is your mom ? Just tell Miriam to get all the money from the bank. Tell her the truth. About what's really going on ! She can't do that. The bank won't allow her to take that money. Let her get it from the company ! We have a "No co-operation" policy. Miriam would be liable. She'd have to go to the police. Even the blackmailer knows that. Then just steal it ! I can only transfer up to 50 000 ! Shareholders have digital signatures. Once the daily limit's been reached, we need a second... It's the office, I gotta take this. Alexander ? I just found out. You're at the hospital ? Yeah, my son had a little accident. Wait till the boys at school hear about this. You'll be so cool ! - You don't sound so good yourself. - No... it's... It's nothing serious, he's just a bit shaken up. - But he'll be okay. - I'm glad to hear that. I understand if you couldn't take care of our little problem yet. No, I did. My contact for the building permits, there is a way but... - It's not a hundred percent legal. - We shouldn't talk over the phone. I can't leave yet and the offer expires at noon. What are we talking about ? Vacation for two in the Caribbean ? More like a condominium with a garage. We can't hide that in our bookkeeping. I know. It's just profit distribution between partners. They need to agree. - We can't. It will look like a bribe ! - A private investment ! It's fine. We haven't done that in a long time. What if your guy makes trouble ? We have an off-shore account. No names and, no connections. And this guy will only deal with me. Have I ever let you down ? But it's just an offer. It'll work out in the long run. - Okay. For old time's sake. - Good decision. Not everyone's here yet. Only Haase, Bahrs, Breuer and Kommer. I'll take care of those four, but you'll have to convince the others. Alright. Put the usual shareholders' resolution on the server. I'll call the rest and we'll get it done in the next two hours. Good. You're a problem solver, Karl. You've never disappointed us. - Thanks. - Most of them wanted Omar. But I wanted to promote you. No problem. Omar was... - Omar's my friend. - Freudian slip ! - I'm at the bank, Simone's not here. - I know. A virtual company meeting's taking place. Rocher wants to start a profit distribution, 50 000 per partner. Omar is still... at the doctor's, but he approved the fifty thousand. I'll authorize as the co-signer. Go online and wire the money. - With my code ? - Yes. I told you Omar already signed. How's Marius ? - He's okay, nothing too serious. - Good. Transfer the money of the other to the same account as Omar's. Wait. The profit distribution isn't going to the partners ? - Yes, but they'll reinvest it. - OK. Has that already been decided ? Yes, it's been approved, so go ! - I'll need your authorization. - You've got it ! The offer's only good till noon, so go ahead and wire it. Alright, Karl. I'm listening. Give me the news. The partners will be paying into an account. And then it's yours. Just like that ? But that doesn't affect you. In about three or four hours.. - They'll be ruined. - Probably. But what happens to you ? Let me explain the no-cooperation policy of your company. You will be liable. You're ruined. - Why do you give a shit ? - I don't. I just want my money. How do I know you won't blow us up once you get the money ? Whether you believe me or not, I'll disconnect the bomb. Now let's get to my 67 547. It'll be going into the offshore account. The entire 550 grand. That's not what I asked for. I want your 67 547 Euro. Your own money ! Why ?! Give me more time, I can't reach my wife ! I have all the time in the world Karl. Josefine. Where's your mom ? Please. - Where's your mother ? - She's with Pascal. My friend Eveline's father. He's single. I have Eveline's number. D'Angelo. I have to talk to Simone. Sorry, wrong number. I know she's there. Tell her it's urgent. I'm her husband. I told you, you have the wrong number. Listen, asshole. I don't care that you're screwing her. But if you don't put her on the phone I swear I'll beat the shit out of you ! Your husband's on the phone. How did he know you were here ? Karl ? - Simone. - Don't you tell her about me ! - Listen... - Who gave you this number ? Just listen to me. I'm in the car with the kids. What ? Why ? Why aren't they in school ? I'll explain later. - I need you to do exactly what I say. - Okay. Go to the bank and take out all of our money. What ? Are you serious ? Course not. Just a little joke on you and your lover. Simone, this is serious. Ge to the bank ! Right now ! And if I don't ? Then all of us are in great danger. What ? What do you mean, Karl ? What's going on ? I can't tell you right now. Karl, take it easy. I know you're in shock, but our marriage hasn't. - Let's talk. Keep the kids out of this. - God, are you listening to me ? Don't call the cops. You can't talk to anyone, I mean nobody ! - Simone, just get to the bank. - Karl, what are you up to ? Just do what I say ! Where are the kids ? I want to speak to them right now ! Nothing about Marius. She won't be able to handle it. Hi, Mom. It's me. Yeah, we're okay. - Marius is right here he's fine too. - Mommy. Yeah, I've known for awhile. I'm sorry I never told you. No, Dad hasn't hurt us. But please listen to him. Do as he says. And just don't argue. Please Mom, I can't. I just can't. Simone, the money is waiting. It's every bit of your savings but I promise I'll get it back to you. I'm leaving now. I don't care about the money, I just want my children. Nothing will happen to them. Drive. You've been sitting there too long. Next stop is the hospital. We'll get you all fixed up, okay ? - Karl ? - Where are you ? - Inside the bank. Miriam is here. - Don't tell her anything. She thinks you need the money for purchasing a franchise. I won't say a word. - My wife's at the bank now. - Good. - Who are you talking to ? - It's nobody, Simone. What happens after I get the money ? What do you need it for ? No more questions, Simone. I don't understand, this is crazy ! Gotta go, I'm hanging up. Evelin's father. That's mommy. Mom ! - My wife's leaving the bank. - Is she alone ? - Yeah. If you hurt her... - I only want my money. Tell her to take it to Fischer-Passage. Where your first project was in Berlin. Yeah ? Simone, take the money to Fischer-Passage. Around the corner. Fischer-Passage. Okay, I'm going. No, I'm going to walk. I'll explain later. Mommy ! Shit ! Get lost ! Please ! Leave ! Go on ! Get back ! - Get back, man ! - Josefine, you okay ? - Get the hell away from the car ! - Don't worry, it's gonna be OK. - What happened to him ? - Get lost, man ! Karl, what's going on ? Wait ! Hang on ! Stop ! - Karl, what the hell's going on ? - He's a lawyer, he wants to help us ! Who else is there, Karl ? Who are you talking to ? No one. Shit ! I'm almost there. - Okay. Hurry, and we'll be alright. - Put the kids on the phone. I can't right now but they're fine, I swear. - Damn it ! - Tell her to go the main entrance. Go to the main entrance, by the park. I'm almost there. There's a lot of people around. I see her. Tell her to put the bag next to the empty bench and then leave. There's an empty bench, put the bag next to it and leave, okay ? Are you nuts ? Leave 65 grand and then just leave ? - No way. Tell me what's going on. - Trust me and do what I say. I see police officers. What's going on ? Simone talk to me, what's going on ? - You bastard, it's a trap ! - I didn't tell anyone ! - You idiot ! - I don't know anything. - You called the cops, didn't you ? - I haven't called them ! I swear ! - Daddy, what's going on ? - Karl, is Marius hurt ? We're going to the hospital now. Keep calling the shareholders. I want the 550 thousand now. You know what you have to do if you want to go to the hospital. Do what say, Karl. Three, two... Stop the fucking car or you're dead ! Okay ! You win. Make those phone calls. And this time try to sound a little more natural. After all the bullshit you fed the world it's time you think about your son. Hello, Mr. Brendt. How are you ? Hello ? Hello ? Karl ? What's wrong, Karl ? Your son needs you now. Think of Marius ! Hello ? Mr. Bren... No. You said I should think about Marius ? He's all I can think about. My son is... My son is bleeding to death in the backseat. And you're expecting me to play a con-man ? I can get you your money, all of it. But there must be a happy ending. Understand ? I must believe in the lie to tell the lie. Okay. A deposit of 50 000 just showed up in my off shore account. Get me two more payments, and then you can take your son to the hospital. - Yes ? - Yeah, it's me again. - Can you hear me now ? - Yes. What can I do for you ? It's about our project in Schwabing. We received a demolition order. Okay. The whole thing could end up costing us millions. But we can change their minds with a very generous donation. How generous ? 50 000 from each of us. Rocher would provide the money as profit. You'd have to tax it and... Can we talk about this later ? I'll be back in the office on Wednesday. No. The offer ends at noon. The shareholder's resolution is ready... Concerning the project in Schwabing, there's a demolition order. It sounds like we don't have any other choice. Count me in. - Super. - You're a real trooper, little brother. All you have to do is go online and sign. Two hundred thousand. The money's yours. - I want to see it in my account. - I've done everything you asked ! I'm feeling better. It doesn't hurt anymore. - Dad ? - Okay, I see 150 thousand. He can't feel his leg anymore ! God ! Please, my son lost a lot of blood. I'll still be able to play soccer ? He can't feel his leg. Please, let me take him to the hospital. - Please ! - Dad, hurry up ! Please. Alright, go to the hospital. But only Marius can leave the car. We're going to the hospital now. Hear that ? It's around the corner. They're gonna make you all better. It won't take long at all... - Subject has been located. - No ! No ! Subject is on the run. All units ! Shit ! - Run them over ! - I can't ! - Turn off your engine and get out ! - Please, you have to let me go ! - You have a wounded child inside. - Yeah but I can't get out... Take off now, or boom ! What's it gonna be ? Open up these doors ! Dad ! You are surrounded. Turn off your engine and exit the vehicle. Put your hands where I can see them ! Slowly, turn off your engine and step out of the car. Be sensible and step out ! - They've got me surrounded. - I told you to run them over. I'm surrounded by the police. I have no control over this. - Please ! - No. You still owe me 350 thousand. I can't get out. There's a bomb under my seat, get back ! What bomb ? Tell him to back off or you'll set off the bomb. - Get everyone away ! - We can't. Get out ! Say if they don't leave you'll set off the bomb. Say it or I'll blow you up ! - ... or I'll set the bomb off ! - Alright. We're gonna back off. But at least let your children go. - I can't ! - Leave your kids out of this. If you let me drive to the hospital I'll let both of them out. Good. But you must deactivate the bomb first. No ! You gotta tell them to move their cars and clear the way ! Alright. Okay men, pull back ! All units, retreat. No, stay here ! Back your cars up, so I can get outta here ! Just let me drive on ! You said you'd let my boy go, you promised. I promised nothing. The situation has changed. Please ! No one will leave the car until I get all of my money. No ! No ! Everything's gonna be okay. No ! Mr. Steinmuller ? It's Karl Brendt, how are you ? Of course it's a good investment. Trust me on this. Karl Brendt. You spoke to Rocher ? No, it won't come back to you. Trust me. There's a reason for saying we wouldn't do it anymore. At least not in Germany. It's an excellent investment. There's no risk at all ! If we don't move on this, our whole project will fall through. Location's good. Clear the umbrellas, they're blocking our view. His wife's here, Chief. We're coming in with the wife. Shit. She's not gonna stay calm. What about the brother ? We're still trying to locate him. But so far no luck. Let's give her a shot, but if she starts getting hysterical we'll intervene. - Okay. - Bomb squad is here. Everyone please back away. This area isn't safe. Excuse me, please clear out. You too. - Where's Drache ? - In the Command Unit. - Inspector ! Good morning. - Morning Zach. Nice day huh ? First the explosion uptown and now a hostage crisis. - Could you fill me in ? - Sure. 40 ago a man he saw a young boy that was injured inside an SUV. The father was supposed to be taking his kids to school, but he kidnaps them, then tells his wife to empty out their bank accounts. - Who called it in ? - The wife's lawyer. She wants a divorce, you know how these things can get ugly. We had him surrounded but he refused to leave the car and threatened to detonate the bomb. After what happened this morning in front of that jewelry store I'm not taking any chances. He's sitting there with his kids in the backseat. The boy needs medical attention, but he won't release him. Any connections between him and the other victims ? It's a possibility but their bodies aren't identified yet. What is he demanding ? That he be allowed to drive away. This guy was in full panic mode. According to the lawyer he's having financial difficulties. Now his wife wants a divorce. He could simply be cracking. Seems cut and dry. Revenge on his wife's a strong incentive. A father, two kids, one of them injured. I'm gonna need more than that. Let's find out if there's really a bomb. If so, we'll head the operation. I'll go there and assess the situation. Don't do anything to set him off. - What's next ? - We go as planned. Get the snipers into position and try to reach this guy's brother. Snipers take your posts and wait for my command. Great, it'll be worth it for all of us, Ramon. You're an excellent liar, Karl, but that's no surprise. - Lying is standard procedure. - You've got 400 thousand. Not yet. I only see 300 000 in my account. Make another call. Stop ! Don't call yet. I see the bomb squad coming. Hide my phone, but I still want to hear everything. Don't give it to her. If you do, I can track it and then boom ! Rolling my window down. Karl, I'm Pia Zach, head of the police bomb squad. My dog is trained to sniff out explosives. - Tell us what you want. - To take my son to the hospital. - Then let him out ! We'll treat him. - I don't think I can. - Are you nuts ? No one gets out ! - No. No I can't. - The dog's found the bomb, sir. - Shit ! Sir. I've got something. Several witnesses saw him speeding away from that explosion this morning. One of them identified him when he was arguing with him over a parking spot. Said he was acting like a lunatic. They said he was on the phone the entire time. Let's get the wife and lawyer in here. Karl, I'll come and give you some water and bandages okay ? - It's just some water and bandages. - Remember I can see everything. Marius, how are you doing ? How'd you get hurt ? - When the other car exploded. - We'll get you out soon. Josefine, are you okay ? Why do you want to blow the car up ? Just let me drive out of here. UNKNOWN CALLER - What it is you're trying to do ? - I'm not sure myself. Okay. Then I'll get you a psychiatrist. But you have to do something for us. - Your son needs medical attention. - Let me drive on and I'll let him out. I don't know why you'd want to blow your family up. But you're not going anywhere. If I let you leave here, armed with a bomb through the city, the public is now at risk. - Let your son out now. - I can't... I can't. I'll leave but I'll stay in sight. You heard everything, let's stop this. Marius needs a doctor right now. Say something, dammit ! "Throw out the radio..." I just can't do this anymore. I've had it. Shit ! He's thrown the walkie-talkie out the window ! Nice try, Karl. Do you think I'm an idiot ? If your son's doing that badly, then you shouldn't risk his life. My big boy. You're being so brave. This will all be over soon. See how your sister's taking such good care of you ? Think of that when you want to play tricks on her again ! Say something. Marius, say something. - Please, let me hear your voice. - Josefine ? - Marius ? - That's Mommy ! Mommy... Marius, honey ! Karl ! Karl, please allow the police to help you. I promise you everything'll be alright. Any problems we have can be solved. And we can solve them as a family. - Why's she saying that ? - No idea. Please, let's be a loving family again ! Karl, what have you done ? I want my children back, please ! Settle down. You can't, please. Marius ! No one trusts you anymore, Karl. Not your wife, your daughter. And soon, not even your son. I said, do nothing that would set him off. I have to get this situation under control quickly and safely. I can convince him he'll have a happy future with his family. Let me do my job. You could've put all our lives in jeopardy. You idiot ! - Make another call. - You know they'll follow the money ? Here. Even if the transfers go through, they'll be revoked. After all this... - It doesn't make sense. - Not with my off-shore account. I pass the money through a network of accounts around the world. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Please, let Marius get out. - You know the price. 550 thousand. - It's the office, I gotta get it. Alexander. Karl. I just got off the phone with the police. Are you alright ? - Yeah... We're okay. - My God. Karl, the board and our associates assure you of our full support. We hope you and your children come out of this unharmed. - I appreciate that Alexander. Thanks. - So what's going on, Karl ? Alexander, I... - I can't explain. - I see. I know this situation's difficult for you, but I hope you understand that under these circumstances we cannot give you power of attorney. I can't explain it right now. This is only about the money from your wife's account ? Did you always act according to the rule of our non-cooperation policy ? - I know our policy. - Of course. Considering the circumstances, I must inform you that you are terminated. You'll have to bear the consequences of the decisions you made earlier today. Your shares will be placed in escrow for security reasons. - What ? - The conversations were recorded. We also reviewed your statements from today and will take legal action. What the hell are you talking about ? I hope you understand my position. Personally I support you 100 percent. But business-wise, I have to protect the company and our investors. - That's why you called ? - Karl... In the middle of this ? With my kids in the back... - You call to fire me ? - I hope this ends well for you, Karl. We fully support you. Okay. I need 150 grand. Transfer it to me you'll save my life as well as my children's. I have worked for you for over seventeen years ! I'm sure everything will turn out well for you. You have our support. Do you see now how much of an asshole you are, Karl ? Nobody gives a shit if you live or die. No one. Your company knows everything now. You're ruined. How will I get the rest of my money ? Karl ? Rocher was the first to call me. He'll consider who he initiates and then he'll speak to our legal department. I can still call the other shareholders. He'll never expect it. At least not in the next half hour. Good, because the life of your children depends on... - Hello ? - Reception's gone. Mine too. They're blocking our phones ! Why the hell would you do that ? Are you crazy ? Don't come any closer, the bomb could go off ! Karl, the detonator was deactivated. That bomb this morning was activated by a remote detonator in a cell phone. Whoever did this, can't set it off. But you must not leave your seats. Karl, are your brother's money problems the reason for all this ? The police spoke to your wife's lawyer. We know about your marriage problems and that your brother's almost bankrupt. But you heard everything on the phone ! No. That takes some time. And you threw out the walkie-talkie. What does this have to do with my brother ? I'm sitting on a bomb with my children in the back, my son's bleeding to death! Listen, these are my kids. My kids. You're doing such a great job. You're safe now, Karl. And I believe you. Okay ? - I trust you. Now you gotta trust me. - Yeah. Okay. First I'm going to check your door. Okay, I'm gonna open it. Now. All this for 67 grand ? Did he demand anything else ? No. That was it. It's a paintball mine. Same kind that was in the other car. The other car was Omar Cicek's. My friend and colleague. He converted the paintball mine into a real bomb. Then replaced the paint with dynamite. The mines are activated by pressure applied to the hammer. When released... Right now your bodyweight's on the hammer. It's extremely important that you don't get up no matter what okay ? - I'm going to the passenger door now. - Good job, Marius. - Any idea who could've done this ? - No. Did he say anything that makes you think you know each other ? He knows where I work and where I live. He's got my cell number, knows how my company works... - A former colleague maybe ? - I have no idea. Maybe it's something personal ? Revenge ? I don't know why. The mine is under this plate. We have to jam it so you can get out safely. We'll do the same with your seats. It's easier then it sounds. He must know about explosives. Chemistry students can make bombs out of nothing. The ingredients can be bought and the instructions are online. I need your phone. In order to retrace the phone calls. Mrs. Zach, you should look at this. These cables look strange. Probably just a decoy. Of course we'll double check. Okay, you do that. - Why not give her the real phone ? - It has a GPS tracker, I can't risk it. We gotta get him out now, he's lost a lot of blood. Get it ! You must hide it. - Everything okay ? - Yeah. How is Marius doing ? He needs a blood transfusion so we're taking him out now. The good news is the only bombs are the two in the front. - The dog found nothing in the back. - But there's a cable ! - It's a bluff, Karl. - Are you sure ? What if the dog missed something ? Karl, we're positive. But we'll still be careful. You're getting out ! But what about you, Dad ? Won't you be coming with us ? We'll make sure he gets out too. - I'll join you soon. I promise. - Karl, we've got it under control. If everything's under control, why all the procautions ? - Karl, hand me the key. - Why ? Don't you trust my dad ? Please, the key. They don't believe you, dad ! - Move these cars away ! - Get them outside the perimeter. We've located Karl Brendt's brother and we're bringing him in. Dad ? Why do you want to set off the bomb ? What did you say ? You know I would never hurt you ! But that's what you said before, that's what they all think. I'd rather die than let anything happen to you ! Marius, look at me ! - Get them out. You take the boy. - Marius ! Help him, something's wrong, he's isn't moving ! Don't panic. He's just unconscious. Josefine, tell him that I'd never harm either one of you ! Promise me ! Tell him yourself. You tell him too and your mother. No matter what happens ! - Daddy, stop, this isn't good-bye ! - On three, I'll lift you out. Let go now, Josefine. Let go of my hand ! - I have a clear shot, sir. - One, two, three ! No, daddy ! The boy is out. - Let go ! - Karl, let go of her hand ! Zach's trying to pull out the girl, he's not letting her go. Sick asshole. - Karl, I have to get her out ! - Josefine, let go ! No ! Dad... - Why did you do that ? - I can't leave you here ! You crazy ? You could've blown us up ! You know what you've just done ? If I'm here they won't shoot you, dad. What ? Dad. Daddy... My God. Where are you bringing him ? Are you his mother ? You can ride with us. - Are you okay ? - Yeah. Now do you understand what I mean about him being a lunatic ? His daughter jumped into that front seat all by herself ! Do you know why ? Because she saw your snipers and thought they'll shoot her father. You're saying this bullshit's all my fault ? That psycho wouldn't let her off the car ! What if he had killed her ? I told you she did it herself. I was right next to them ! Check the tape ! We watched the whole thing. Saw it with our own eyes. Karl, let her go ! Let go of her hand ! - I'm still in command here... - Yes, that's right ! And it's because you were in command that that girl is at the mercy of a sick asshole, so what's your next move ? If anything happens to he, it's because of you not me. Karl, let her go ! Let her go now ! Listen, Pia. It's not about us. You did your best. You didn't disarm the bomb, however you did save the boy's life. But that father's sick. He lied to you, just like he lied to his own wife. Now he's in control again. He knows all he has to do is raise his ass and then he wins. I've got an idea. Have him talk to someone he trusts. We found Karl's brother and he's willing to convince Karl give himself up. But I'll need your approval for him to approach the car. For what ? Karl doesn't control the bomb. How do you know that for sure ? Let's try it this way and if I'm right then everything will be fine. Why not send his wife ? I still think this sicko's doing this shit because of her. We send her to him, and he could set it off. Hold your positions. I wonder what they're doing. Mom met Pascal at my school. It was on parent's night. You never go with her. I wanted to tell you in case we don't get out of here. But... Why didn't she just talk to me about how she felt ? You can see things, if you open your eyes. Mom said you live with your eyes closed. No ! She says you don't know us. Karl, it's me ! I'm here to help you. Promise me you'll stay calm, okay. - We've lost audio. - Want us to pull out ? Not yet. Well Karl ? Have you realized that you're an asshole yet ? - Who are you ? - Are you serious ? You don't recognize me at all ? You're that dense ? You deserve to be blown apart. - You must think I'm somebody else. - Get the phone. My phone. Do it. The photos. - You remember her though, right ? - What is it you want ? I want your father to know how it feels to lose everything. You can't hurt us, there's no reception. It's him, he is the man ! Josefine, the dashboard ! The airbag. Take the cover off. Go ahead. Nothing will happen. That's the timer. Five minutes. And then boom ! Everyone is watching us right now, so there's nothing I can do for you. - I don't understand what else you want. - See this button ? Look. Watch. I want you to drive off now, and call for the rest of the money. Please... Don't you see I can't ? I just can't, it's too late ! Stop begging. My wife begged and you didn't give a shit. Drive to your building site, around the corner. Berlin Quarter or whatever the hell you call it. The roads are cleared. - Please. - You got five minutes. That's impossible, they took the key. Look at the timer for inspiration. Josefine. Close the cover. - You're staying with us. - Son of a bitch, his own brother ! If we die, you die with us. I am not responsible for what happened to your wife ! - I have nothing to lose. - Karl, stop ! See ya ! Three, two... Hold your fire ! The city ordered the eviction ! I'm an employee, not the owner ! I was just doing my job. I wasn't even there ! You didn't have to be. You still signed the order. I didn't know about their methods. I only knew about it afterwards ! - Please, Karl, don't do it ! - Wait, what are you doing ? - Please, Karl ! I'm begging ! - Wait ! Come back here ! - Don't do this ! - Wait ! Think of Josefine, please ! Think of your children, please ! Here ! Here ! What should we do, dad ? Strap in. If we drive off they'll shoot us. What happened to that woman ? One of our projects, I had to evict the tenants. We bought the building, and then ended their leases. - But that woman didn't want to leave. - And ? We don't handle situations like that so we hired another company. I didn't know how tough they were and when they came to her door again... She jumped. Your project ? - Omar's and mine. - You couldn't even remember her. The situation's changed, Pia. Your guys can't defuse the bomb, so we have to take over. Do you agree or do I call the chief of police ? Good. Listen up. Our guy's name is Karl Brendt, married with two kids, debts and a gambler. Wife wants a divorce and his firm filed a lawsuit against him for fraud. - Why didn't you tell me this ? - We just found out. Today he forced his wife to withdraw all their money from their accounts or he would blow up the car, with their kids and himself in it. At the same time, another car bomb went off uptown. Omar Chichek was promoted above Karl. Karl felt overlooked so gone. He told our bomb expert he was being blackmailed. Yet the cell phone the blackmailer was calling him on, which Karl gave to Mrs. Zach, has no records of any such calls. - Then there was a second phone. - Stop it. Something's not right. Why would his daughter stay with him if he threatened to kill her ? I told you I saw something different. One of the EMT's heard the boy say: "Dad, why do you want to set off the bomb ?". Also he told us that he and his sister never heard the voice of the caller. We saw what happened when the brother approached him. - The guy's a psycho ! - It seems pretty clear. He's insisting he's being blackmailed, and it's not what a psychopath does. When a psychopath has a plan they stick to it. Karl isn't... You're not going to let this go ? What more do you want ? We can't kill a man unless we're absolutely sure he's not the victim. Of course not. But we can't let him sit in the middle of town with a bomb. Especially with his daughter. - If you get close, use your spray. - Stop. Sorry, but only essential personnel can be present from this point on. We can't allow the father or his daughter to get up off their seats. If they try anything, give us a signal and the snipers shoot them. - Alright then. Good luck. - Okay, got it. Hawk One ? - In position. - Hawk One in position and ready. All units are in position and waiting for the signal. I want to talk to the wife right now. Okay, we're on it. We got her. Simone, it's Pia Zach from the bomb squad. I know this is a bad time but I must speak with you. How's Marius ? He's in intensive care. Simone, I'm getting conflicting information about Karl's work habits. - From who ? - Your lawyer, his colleagues, boss... But I only... Commisioner Drache told me to say those things to Karl. Tell me, is Karl capable of trapping his kids in a car with a bomb ? I know you're going through a rough divorce because of Karl's gambling. - That's what your lawyer said. - Excuse me ? That's not true. - His brother said he was going crazy. - You spoke to Hans ? Yeah. He went to the car but Karl tried pulling him inside. - But Hans is in Thailand. - In Thailand ? Are you sure ? - Is Hans his only brother ? - Yes. Hawk Two and Three are approaching the vehicle. Stand by for my signal. - We're bringing you food ! - We just want to get out ! We'll leave it on the ground and leave. - How's my son ? How's Marius ? - I don't like this, dad. - Stop ! Go away ! - Stay calm. - It's just some food, stay calm. - We don't want anything ! Daddy, the timer's started ! We have marital issues, but Karl would never harm me or the kids. He has money problems, because he's helping his brother save his hotel. Thanks Simone, I have to go now. Arrest the man who said he's Karl's brother. Now ! Find the brother and arrest him ! I need a photo of the man who went to the car. Blue jacket and jeans. Go away ! I said go ! - Take it easy, it's only food. - Get away from here ! - Stop ! He's got a key ! - The suspect is moving ! - Hawk One, you are clear to shoot. - One of our guys is in the way. Stop now ! Cancel the operation ! Suspect is heading southbound towards the barricade. He's going to try and break through. Daddy, stop ! Got him. - Call off the snipers right now ! - Hawk One, hold your fire ! Daddy ! Oh my God ! All units, suspect is heading toward Berlin Quarter. - Don't stop him till I speak to him ! - Roger that. And clear him a pathway. There's still a live bomb in that car. Wait ! I'll come with you. All units, follow the suspect but do not intervene, clear the roads ahead of him. Show that picture to everyone. I wanna find out who that asshole is. Get Karl on the line. - Dad, your arm's bleeding ! - That wasn't so hard, was it ? - My father is hurt, he's been shot ! - I know how he can get my money. He can't do that, he needs help now ! Tell him to turn right after the light and then continue straight. Look, my dad, he made a mistake. He's sorry, we're sorry. He didn't know what his company was doing, he's not responsible ! That's the problem with blame. It gets pushed from one person to the next. Your father's not directly responsible, but indirectly, which is just as bad. But what you're doing won't bring your wife back ! No. But it has to do with responsibility and he has to pay for it ! Okay, you've won. Now let me stop, and let my daughter out, please ! - No, daddy please ! - Absolutely not. Now hurry up ! - Dad, the timer's running again ! - Omar paid you ! And my firm. - Don't make my daughter pay ! - How does your company pay ? Stay with him ! Karl ! Josefine, hang up and give the phone to your dad and tell him to answer. Karl, we've got him. We know who he is ! Fuck... - Whose city is this ? - It's our city ! - Whose property is this ? - It's our property ! Karl, how will your company pay ? I'm waiting. Don't worry, they'll pay. Just listen. Move the demonstrators down to the water, keep them out of the way. - Yes ? - It's me, Karl. - Karl, are you alright ? - Shut up and listen. I informed the building authorities, police and the local press about the illegal slush funds we set up. What ? Where are you ? You're not the only one who recorded our phone calls. The police will see that every partner in the company agreed with transferring all that money to an offshore account in order to bribe an official. All of you signed. You won't get out of this. Karl, please. I was against firing you... That will end the company. And my life's work. Please. Please, let my daughter go. - Drive to the river. - I can't, there's protesters. Do it now ! Then I'll tell you how to defuse the bomb. What's your plan ? If you want to get out of there, stop asking questions. This will all be over soon. You'll see. We need back up ! Let me through, please. Let us through ! Let us through, please ! - Push the demonstrators back. - Roger that, we're moving em'. We're here. There's a metal plate under Josefine's seat. Push it down when she gets up and the bomb won't explode. Make sure you leave enough pressure on your seat too. - What about you, daddy ? - Karl, you'll stay. - Daddy, you can't stay. - Listen, Josefine, you have to. I'll be okay. It's time to leave. Daddy, please. Tell Marius and your mother I love them both. Daddy, wait. Leave now. One more thing. That man's right. I am responsible for that woman. I knew those guys were rough. I couldn't admit... I should have seen it, like with mom. Go now. Go ! The girl is out. Just the two of us now. The girl's out but a man just sat down next to him. That bastard's always a step ahead ! Josefine ! Get Karl on the phone right now ! You swine ! My God, what the hell else do you want from me ? - My money. - You're psychotic. There's an army of cops behind us ! I can't take it anymore I'm done. Go on. Let's find out what they want. Karl, it's Pia. I'm sorry that we all doubted you. - Can the other man hear me ? - Yeah, he can. We know who you are, Lucas. I know what happened to your wife. I understand why you're angry. It's terrible what they did to you. But this isn't the solution. Yes, it is. And let me tell you why. You've got job security while the rest of us are getting screwed over. There's someone who wants to talk to you. He's on the phone. Lukas ? It's me, Anna. Please, you've gotta stop this. It's not what she would've wanted. Anna, I'm sorry. But how could I let this go ? There is no way I could. Think of Peter ! Do you want your son to grow up without his father ? Please ! Believe me, I'm doing this for my wife, you, and Peter. For all the people who don't want to keep being pushed through the edge by those assholes, then take the money and the land for themselves. I know it's a lot, but please, look after Peter for me. I can't do that... Lukas ? Lukas ? Lukas ? Fuck ! You have a son. - He needs his father. - Anna's strong. And loving. She will raise him better than I ever could. Your plan doesn't make sense. You won't get the money. They'll catch you. It's not for me. It's for Peter when he's older. Everything's arranged. And I'll never be caught. I'm sorry. Now that you're ruined just like me, how does it feel when someone takes everything from you ? Your family, your job, money. All of it. Now you know what an asshole you are, right ? Clear the way ! Get back ! You were gonna kill me anyway. Even if I got you the money. The thought of revenge on you was the only thing that kept me alive. Everyday, every minute, every second. It is not about hate, but justice ! The bomb will still work under water ! Wait ! Water won't stop the explosion. Once their weight's off their seats, it'll go off. Daddy ! No ! Get some divers down here, now ! Dad ! No ! Daddy ! Karl ! Daddy ! Thanks. DON'T. GET. OUT ! Subtitling GRETE MÜLLER
