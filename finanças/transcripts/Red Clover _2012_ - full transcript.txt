Girl: THERE ONCE WERE SOME IRISH FOLK, BUT SADLY, THEY WERE QUITE BROKE. SO THEY PACKED UP THEIR CRATES AND MOVED TO THE STATES, AND THEIR FORTUNE THEY BROUGHT IN A POKE. NOW, THEIR LUCK, IT CAME FAST, AND THEIR FORTUNES GREW VAST, BECAUSE THEY STOLE THE LUCK OF A CREATURE, BUT THE THING GOT AWAY, AND THEIR GOLD TURNED TO HAY. THE TOWN WAS APPALLED, AND FOOLS THEY WERE CALLED, FOR EVER DARING TO GAIN FROM THE DREADED LUCHORPAIN. [THUNDER] BUT... THAT ALL CAME LONG BEFORE ME. MY PART IN THIS TALE STARTS EXACTLY AS IT ENDS... WITH A BANG. [GUNSHOT] YOU MISSED IT HIGH RIGHT, TOOTS. YOU'RE TOO GOOD A SHOT TO MISS IT HIGH RIGHT. LET'S ADJUST THAT SIGHT. LIFE IS ALL ABOUT MATH, ALCHEMY, AND LUCK. WITH US O'HARAS, IT'S MOSTLY LUCK. YEAH, YOU AND THAT LUCKY BOAR'S TOOTH. IT'S AN IRRATIONAL WORLD. I DON'T MAKE THE RULES. I JUST BREAK THEM. [COCKS RIFLE] DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE ALL THAT STUFF? YOU KNOW, LUCK AND FAIRIES AND MAGIC? I CERTAINLY DO. NO, BUT REALLY. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT? THERE ARE MORE THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH, HENRIETTA, THAN ARE DREAMT UP IN YOUR PHILOSOPHY. WHAT? EXACTLY. [ANIMAL GRUNTING] YOU GOT ONE IN THE CHAMBER? NO. PUT ONE IN. THERE IT IS. FOLLOW ME.

SHE'S FINE. SHE JUST GOT SPUN AROUND AND KNOCKED DOWN. FELL DOWN? HONEY, SWEETHEART, ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT? YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE? I WAS WALKING... HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU THOSE DAMN BOARS ARE DANGEROUS! YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A HUNTING LICENSE, FOR PETE'S SAKE! WHAT THE HELL DO I NEED A HUNTING LICENSE FOR? I KNOW YOU. IF YOU KNEW ME, YOU KNOW HOW PISSED OFF I'D BE IF I KNEW YOU TOOK HER OUT. IT'S ONE THING TO PUT YOUR OWN LIFE IN DANGER. ALL RIGHT? IT'S QUITE ANOTHER TO PUT KAREN'S. YOU'RE CROSSING THE LINE, OLD MAN. WHAT? SHE'S VERY CAPABLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SEE, OK? BUT WHEN I LOOK AT HER, I SEE A LITTLE GIRL. WELL, OPEN YOUR EYES. MY EYES ARE OPEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SEE? THEY SEE THE WHOLE TOWN SAYING YOUR POP IS A LUNATIC. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE BEEN DEFENDING YOU... TILL NOW. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEM. THEY'RE RIGHT. THEY'RE ALL RIGHT. [CAR DOOR SLAMS AND ENGINE STARTS] WHAT? I HURT YOUR FEELINGS? I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS. WHAT IN THE HELL? I SHOULD HAVE MOVED MY CAT AND DOG. WHAT IN THE HELL? [LOW GROWLING] YOU WANT MY GOLD TOOTH? [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSIONS] ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? DAD, I DIDN'T... DIDN'T JUST FALL IN THE WOODS. SOMETHING ATTACKED ME. ATTACKED? WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING ATTACKED YOU? AN ANIMAL? IT GOT CAUGHT IN SOME ROOTS, I SHOT IT, AND IT RAN. WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE SAFE, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU'RE SHOOTING AT, HONEY. WHAT? I'M JUST GLAD THAT POPS IS TEACHING YOU TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. HEY, HAP. TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU. GRAB SOME REAL ESTATE. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. LUCKY NUMBER 7. YOU READY TO TALK ABOUT IT, OR DO I HAVE TO WAIT TILL NUMBER 8?

TEMPING FATE HUNTING OVER THERE ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? HAVEN'T FOUND ANY FAIRY FOLK OVER THERE IN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. BUT SOMETHING'S WRONG. DON'T START WITH THE LEPRECHAUNS AGAIN. I'M STILL PICKING TEETH OFF THE FLOOR FROM THE LAST FIGHT YOU STARTED OVER THOSE DAMN THINGS. HERE. JUST BE GLAD YOU'RE NOT OLD MAN McHENRY. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? WELL, HIS BED-AND-BREAKFAST BURNED DOWN ON TUESDAY. LOOK. ANYBODY GET HURT? NO, BUT STILL... LUCK OF THE IRISH. NO NUMBER 8's TILL YOU STOP WITH THE LEPRECHAUN CRAP. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU FINE FOLKS?

I ALSO HAVE THAT BLOG THAT I WRITE CALLED "STRANGE HAPPENINGS." I HAVE SEEN IT. AH, COOL. YOU WERE AT THE PHARMACY. YOU'RE NOT FEELING TOO GOOD? NOT REALLY, NO. WELL, ANYWAY, I WAS WONDERING IF... YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD A MINUTE, YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT... EXPERIENCE YOU HAD OUT IN KEENING WOODS. BECAUSE I SAW THE POLICE REPORT YOUR DAD WROTE THAT YOU WERE ATTACKED BY AN ANIMAL, BUT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT COMPLETELY. SO I DON'T KNOW. I WAS JUST KIND OF WONDERING IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE IT FOR ME. NO. KARL, I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING THAT FOR YOUR BLOG. OH, OK. STRANGE CREATURE, HUH? NO. - UNEARTHLY? OTHERWORLDLY? - NO. KARL! NO. YEAH. BUT, SEE... I WAS DOING RESEARCH ON THE AREA THAT YOU WERE HUNTING IN, AND... I JUST NOTICED THAT IT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TREE OF TEARS, AND I WAS WONDERING IF ANYTHING STRANGE HAPPENED. WAIT. WHAT IS THE TREE OF TEARS? IT'S RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF KEENING WOODS. YOU HEARD OF IT? NO. AS LEGEND HAS IT, IT'S, UM... THE TOWN HAS SOME DARK SECRETS THAT ARE BURIED RIGHT THERE. YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS THING YOU SHOT? I GET 100,000 HITS A WEEK ON MY BLOG. NO, KARL. YOU WEREN'T REALLY OUT THERE HUNTING BOAR, WERE YOU? WHAT? YOU'RE AN O'HARA. COME ON. OH, AND WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? IT'S, UH... POPS O'HARA, THE O'HARA LEGACY. [SIGHS] OK. THANKS, KARL. OK. I GET IT.

YOUR DAD'S GONNA SHUT THE PLACE DOWN IN A FLASH. OH, COME ON. WHEN I WAS 10, YOU LET ME SIT THERE AND SING "O DANNY BOY" FOR TWO BEERS WITH POP. YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT THEN. SWEETHEART... THAT'S COMMERCE. I KNEW IT. YOU'RE CHEATING ME, OLD MAN! HEY. WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU CAN'T CHEAT AT DARTS. YOU CAN EITHER THROW THE DART IN THE BULL'S-EYE, OR YOU CAN'T. THE ONLY PERSON WHO'S EVER CHEATED YOU WAS THE GUY UPSTAIRS. HE CHEATED YOU OUT OF ANY BRAINS. KNOCK IT OFF, BOTH OF YOU. HEY, O'HARAS DON'T HUSTLE. GET OUT. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? SOMEONE WHO CAN HAVE THE SHERIFF HERE IN 2 MINUTES. NOW LEAVE. YOU HEARD THE LADY. HIT THE BRICKS. YOU'RE HUSTLING DART GAMES NOW? THAT'S A NEW LOW. JUST SEPARATING A FOOL FROM HIS GOLD. YOU WANT TO PLAY? POP, I, UM... I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? I LOOKED IT UP. IT SAYS IT'S AN ANCIENT CURSE FROM IRELAND. YOU PICK A RED 4-LEAF CLOVER, AND YOU RELEASE AN EVIL SPIRIT. IF YOU DON'T GET IT IN 4 DAYS, YOU'RE DEAD. I PICKED ONE YESTERDAY. SO, WHAT DO WE DO? WE'RE GONNA NEED THE LUCK OF THE IRISH. LUCK OF THE IRISH? WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? YOU'RE ALWAYS LEGENDS AND FAIRYTALES, BUT NOW SOMETHING REALLY REAL COMES ALONG, AND ALL YOU'VE GOT IS THE LUCK OF THE IRISH. WHAT'S THE END OF THIS FAIRY TALE? I DON'T NEED LUCK OF THE IRISH! I NEED ANSWERS! WELL, KAREN... UM... THE BURN ON YOUR HAND IS CONCERNING, BUT NOT NEARLY SO MUCH... AS THESE BLOODWORK REPORTS. WHY? WHAT ARE THEY? YOUR WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT... THROUGH THE ROOF. AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS YOUR BODY IS FIGHTING OFF A SERIOUS INFECTION, IN THIS CASE, A POTENTIALLY DEADLY ONE. THE STRANGE THING IS, YOU DON'T HAVE A FEVER. THE REST OF YOUR BLOODWORK IS COMPLETELY NORMAL. ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS? - KAREN, THIS IS SERIOUS. - SO AM I. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I THINK I'M CURSED. HA. DON'T TELL ME. YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR POPS AGAIN. KAREN, YOU KNOW THE MAN IS... WHAT? GO AHEAD. SAY IT. A DRUNK. MY POPS IS A CRAZY DRUNK. EVERYBODY SAYS IT. I KNOW IT.

I'M CURSED. KAREN... BE RATIONAL. WHY? IT'S AN IRRATIONAL WORLD. YOU WANT TO PUT ME IN A HOSPITAL FOR 3 DAYS, RUN EVERY TEST IN THE BOOK? I'LL BE DEAD ON THE FOURTH DAY. NO, THANK YOU.

YOU'RE TRYING TO SEDUCE MY BOSS' DAUGHTER WITH GOBLINS, FAIRIES, AND MISCHIEF MAKERS? I'M NOT TRYING TO SEDUCE ANYBODY. I'M... SHE'S IN TROUBLE. OK?

WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME? 1874. 14 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED IN KEENING, AND GOLD WAS TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM THE VICTIMS' BODIES. YOU TELLING ME THIS IS A COPYCAT MURDER? OR A SUPERNATURAL CREATURE. YOU KNOW THE KEENING LEPRECHAUN WAS REPUTED TO HAVE EATEN GOLD TO HEAL ITSELF AND GET STRONGER? OH, MY GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STANDING HERE LISTENING TO YOU. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? GET OUT OF HERE. GO. THERE'S SOMEONE OR SOMETHING OUT THERE OFFING PEOPLE, AND I'VE GOT THE RIGHT TO REPORT IT. LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S DOING THIS. OK? OR WHAT.

YOU DON'T THINK IT'S PATHETIC THAT IT TOOK YOU BEING ATTACKED BY A MYTHICAL CREATURE FOR ME TO MAN UP AND TALK TO YOU? FIFTH GRADE, THOUGH? SERIOUSLY? YEAH. YOU DON'T REMEMBER? YOU KICKED EVAN SHARDOFF'S ASS WHEN HE WAS PICKING ON ME. AH. POP WAS TEACHING ME HOW TO BOX THAT SUMMER. YOU WERE... THE BEST. WHO THE HELL IS THAT? COME ON! [GROWLING] [SCREECHES] IS THAT THE HORSESHOE FROM OUR MAILBOX? YEAH. THAT'S TWO. COME ON. GET IN THE HOUSE. GET IN THE HOUSE. I ALWAYS THOUGHT LEPRECHAUNS WERE NICE LITTLE GUYS IN GREEN WITH POTS OF GOLD. YEAH, IN FAIRY TALES MAYBE, BUT IN THE REAL WORLD, THEY'RE THE VERMIN OF ALL THE FAIRY FOLK. THERE'S OTHER FAIRY FOLK? THERE'S OTHER FAIRY FOLK. [SIGHS] HOW DO YOU THINK THIS TOWN, FOUNDED BY A BUNCH OF IRISH IMMIGRANTS, DID AS WELL AS IT DID? BECAUSE OF THE GOLD MINE IN KEENING GORGE. HOW DO YOU STRIKE A GOLD MINE IN A STATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY GOLD VEINS? THEY CAPTURED A LEPRECHAUN IN THE OLD COUNTRY, AND THEN THEY BROUGHT IT OVER WITH THEM WHEN THEY SETTLED HERE. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT STORY. YEAH, THEY GOT ITS POT OF GOLD, RIGHT? NO. THEY DRAINED THE LUCK OUT OF IT UP AT THE OLD GOLD REFINERY. THEY TURNED IT MEAN AND VICIOUS, AND THEN IT TURNED ON THEM AND ESCAPED. THAT'S WHEN THEY HIRED YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER ELIAS TO HUNT IT DOWN. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB. HE DID A GREAT JOB. HE BURIED IT IN THE WOODS ACCORDING TO IRISH LEGEND. 4 HORSESHOES BOUND THE LEPRECHAUN IN PLACE. THEY WERE MOUNTED ON COMPASS POINTS... NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, AND WEST OF THE GRAVE. SO WHO MOVED THEM? WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT FIRE AT McHENRY'S BED AND BREAKFAST DISLODGED ONE OF THEM, AND THAT'S WHEN THE RED CLOVER BLOOMED. IT'S NOT A BOAR TOOTH ON YOUR NECK, IS IT? NO. THIS WAS PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION BY ELIAS. IN CASE THE TOWN FORGOT, THE O'HARAS NEVER WOULD. SO HE BURIED IT IN THE WOODS? THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO? NO, THAT'S NOT ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO. WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE 4 HORSESHOES, AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO USE THE 4 HORSESHOES AGAINST HIM. WE'VE ALREADY GOT ONE. WE GOT TWO, AND THEY'RE LIKE CRUCIFIXES TO A VAMPIRE. THEY HATE THEM. YEAH, I FIGURED THAT OUT. WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? WELL, I THINK ONE IS AT THE BREWERY, AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS AT THE FIRE, BUT IT'S GONE MISSING. THEN LET'S GO TO THE BREWERY. NO, I'LL GET THE HORSESHOES. WHAT YOU TWO NEED TO DO IS GO THROUGH THE BOOKS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO ATTACH THEM TOGETHER SO WE CAN LIFT THE CURSE. HEY, POP, WHEN WE KILL THAT THING, I GET ITS TOOTH. DEAL. I'M GONNA GET ONE FOR YOU, TOO, SQUIRT. [SIGHS] CHECK THIS OUT. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? THAT IS BLOOD. GREEN BLOOD? FROM WHAT? EXACTLY. WHY DON'T YOU GET IN THERE, GET A SAMPLE? YEAH. I'LL LEAVE THAT TO FORENSICS. IT LOOKS LIKE WHATEVER THIS THING WAS, IT WAS HIDING IN THE DUMPSTER WHEN IT WAS WOUNDED. SOUNDS LIKE MY FATHER. WHY DON'T YOU KEEP IT TOGETHER, BOSS? THERE'S A CRIME SCENE RIGHT THERE. [SIGHS] IT LOOKS LIKE HAPPY WAS TAKING OUT THE TRASH WHEN THIS THING JUMPED OUT AND... DID WE EVER GET THOSE LAB REPORTS ON THOSE PRINTS BACK FROM THE LAKE? YEAH. I E-MAILED BOSTON COLLEGE ZOOLOGY. THEY SAID THERE'S NO SUCH HOOF IN THE DATABASE. THERE'S WHAT? THERE'S NO SUCH HOOF IN THE DATABASE. COME ON. HOOF! - WHAT? - THERE'S NO SUCH HOOF. HOOF. AND FORGET YOUR TROUBLES. COME ON. GET HAPPY. YOU KNOW, IT GETS WEIRDER IN THERE. SEE WHAT I MEAN? YEAH. THAT'S WEIRD. SHOULD I, UH... BE SCARED TO ASK WHAT SORT OF ANIMAL BLEEDS DARK GREEN, RIFLES THROUGH A COIN CASE, AND ONLY TAKES THE GOLD COINS? YEAH. YEAH, I THOUGHT SO. WANT TO HEAR A WEIRDER QUESTION? WHAT EATS GOLD COINS? - Radio: SHERIFF, COPY? - YEAH? WE HAVE A DISTURBANCE BY YOUR HOUSE. WHAT? WITNESSES SAY THEY HEARD A COUPLE OF KIDS SCREAMING THEN A SHOTGUN BEING FIRED BY SOMEONE IN AN OLD MUSTANG. THAT'LL BE RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ON IT. HELLO. YOUR MAJESTY. GOT YOU. I'M NOT THAT FAT! YOU REALIZE WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND ANY BEER. THIS PLACE HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR YEARS. YEAH, BUT HAPPY O'SHANEN IS USING IT TO STORE A WHOLE ROOMFUL OF GOLD LEAF CREAM BEER FOR THE PARADE. THIS IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT YOU MEANT WE WERE DOING WHEN I OFFERED TO HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS TONIGHT. I THOUGHT WE'D DO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, FUN... WITH ME. I DON'T EVEN LIKE DRINKING. YEAH, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WITH A CAR. SHUT UP. QUIT LAUGHING. SERIOUSLY. [SIREN] [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSIONS] WHAT DO YOU WANT? DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE CAR? I GOT HALF A DOZEN CALLS SAYING SHOTGUN BLASTS WERE HEARD IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE, POP. IS THAT SO? CUT THE CRAP. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M GOING TO THE BREWERY. WHY? GIVE ME THE GUN. I GOT A LOT MORE GUNS. I KNOW YOU DO. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU GOT THEM? WHAT ARE YOU SHOOTING AT? I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT IT. NO? REALLY? WELL, I DID. WHAT'S A LEPRECHAUN DOING IN MY TOWN, POP? [SIGHS] KAREN PICKED THE RED CLOVER AND RELEASED IT ACCIDENTALLY. NOW SHE'S CURSED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S BEEN CURSED? GIVE ME THE GUN BACK. I'LL GET IT. SHE'S GOT TWO DAYS. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET IT AND GET IT BURIED BY THEN, AND SHE'LL BE OK. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD, ALL RIGHT? BUT THERE'S PROTOCOL, POP. I'VE GOT TO CALL FOR BACKUP HERE. I GOT YOUR BACKUP. YOU'RE IN THIS ALONE, CONOR. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL YOUR MEN? THAT YOU'RE A LEPRE-COP, HUNTING LEPRECHAUNS? YOU'LL BE THE TOWN JOKE, JUST LIKE ME. FACE IT, PAL. YOU'RE IN THIS ALONE... WITH YOUR DAD. YEAH? WELL... FINE. ALL RIGHT? BUT WE'RE TAKING MY CAR. STEP AWAY FROM THE... VEHICLE. HEY. CHECK THIS OUT. HE'S CALLED THE GREEN MAN. GREEN MAN? YEAH. HE'S AN EARTH CREATURE. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THESE CREATURES FROM IRISH FOLKLORE, THEY HAVE... THEY HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES, BUT THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME. WAIT. LOOK AT THIS. YOU SEE WHERE THEY STAB HIM? LOOK AT THIS. SEE HOW HE HEALS UP? BUT WAIT. CHECK THIS OUT. HERE. LOOK FAMILIAR? WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT FOURTH HORSESHOE. [SIGHS] OH, NICE. AND YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE US. NOPE. JUST DIDN'T CARE. SEEN BEER BEFORE. HAVE FUN, LOSERS. DUDE, CHECK THIS OUT. DID YOU SEE THOSE GOLD FLECKS? YEAH, IT'S AWESOME. THAT IS CRAZY. [GROWLING] AAH! [SCREAMING STOPS] AAH! HEY! RICK! RICK! RICK! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT HAPPENED? RICK! [SCREAMING AND CHOKING] [GROWLING] [DOOR RATTLING] AAH! WHY ARE WE GOING TO THE BREWERY? TO GET THE THIRD HORSESHOE. WHERE'D THE LEPRECHAUN GO? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DOES IT WANT? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WANTS. WELL, HOW DO YOU STOP IT? YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF, CONOR. ASHAMED OF MYSELF? FOR WHAT? FOR NOT KNOWING YOUR FAMILY HISTORY. UP UNTIL YESTERDAY, WHEN I CAME FACE TO FACE WITH THE DAMNED THING, I THOUGHT ALL THIS LEPRECHAUN STUFF WAS A BUNCH OF MALARKEY, OK? BUT NOW I'M WITH THE PROGRAM HERE, POP, AND YOU ARE NOT TELLING ME ANYTHING. SO TELL ME, HOW DO WE KILL IT? YOU CAN'T KILL FAIRY FOLK, SON. THEY'RE IMMORTAL. HA HA HA. THEY'RE IMMORTAL. YEAH. DON'T BE A WISE ASS. HOW DO WE GET RID OF THIS THING? FIRST WE FIND THE 4 HORSESHOES. OK. AND WE PUT THEM TOGETHER IN SOME KIND OF ANCIENT CONFIGURATION, AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO STUN THE LEPRECHAUN. I DON'T KNOW. KAREN AND WHAT'S-HIS-FACE ARE LOOKING IT UP ON THE INTERNET. IT'S NOT LIKE I DO THIS EVERY DAY, CONOR. YOU OK? YOU MEAN OTHER THAN THE ANCIENT DEATH CURSE AND HAVING TO FIGHT A NATURE DEMON WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING, OR YOU MEAN HAVING A FATHER WHO'S COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO MY BLOSSOMING WOMANHOOD AND TRYING TO STIFLE MY PERSONAL GROWTH BECAUSE HE CAN'T LET GO, OR MAYBE BECAUSE MY POPS, THE TOWN DRUNK WHO BELIEVES IN GOBLINS AND FAIRIES, HAS ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE THE ONE WHO'S COMPLETELY RIGHT THIS ENTIRE TIME? LIFE'S A BITCH, HUH? SORRY. NO. I'M SORRY. IT WAS A DUMB QUESTION. NO, IT WASN'T. IT'S JUST... WHO GETS HAUNTED BY A LEPRECHAUN? WHAT IS THAT? IT'S THE STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD OF, AND IT'S HAPPENING TO ME. IT'S LIKE I'M TRAPPED IN SOME BAD MONSTER MOVIE AND CAN'T GET OUT. AND TO TOP IT OFF, THIS THING'S PROBABLY JUST GONNA KILL ME ANYWAY. HEY, IT'S NOT GONNA KILL YOU. IF THIS WAS A BAD MONSTER MOVIE, IT WOULD KILL EVERYBODY BUT YOU. SMALL CONSOLATION. YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEBODY GETS YOU DOWN, IT TAKES 42 MUSCLES TO FROWN, BUT IT ONLY TAKES TWO MUSCLES IF YOU REACH OUT AND PIMP-SLAP THEM. ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I... PIMP-SLAP THE LEPRECHAUN? YES. YES, I AM. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALONE, BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE THERE TO PIMP-SLAP THE LEPRECHAUN WITH YOU. IT'LL BE LIKE A DOUBLE PIMP-SLAP KIND OF DEAL, LIKE A... BA! OK. I'M DONE TALKING. YOU TALK. YOU'RE BETTER AT IT THAN ME. YOU AND I MAKE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM. YEAH? YOU THINK SO? YEAH. WOOD. WHAT? I MEAN... HA HA. I MEAN A BRANCH, A STAFF. A BRANCH STAFF FOR THE HORSESHOES, FOR THE PIMP-SLAP. AND KISSING ME MADE YOU THINK OF THAT? NO. Pop: GIVE ME THAT HAMMER. HEY, REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE 8, WE WENT LEPRECHAUN HUNTING? HOW COULD I FORGET? I BROKE MY ARM THAT YEAR. YOU SURVIVED. NOW YOU WONDER WHY I DON'T WANT YOU TAKING KAREN HUNTING. SHE'S MORE CAPABLE THAN YOU THINK. AND SHE'S A LOT LESS CAPABLE THAN YOU THINK, POP. YOU KNOW, I WAS DISAPPOINTED WE NEVER FOUND A LEPRECHAUN. [LOW GROWLING] WELL, MERRY CHRISTMAS, SON. THERE'S ONE NOW. [COCKS PISTOL] [WATER RUNNING] O'HARA, RADIO. GET A 1031 TO SILVER SHAMROCK BREWERY. WE NEED BACKUP UNITS AND E.M.S. THIS IS NOT GOOD. [THUD] THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. UNBELIEVABLE. LOOK AT THAT THING.

I'M SMART LIKE THAT. [DOOR OPENS] THE BOOK SAYS THAT THE STAFF HAS TO BE MADE OUT OF OAK, SO THIS SHOULD WORK... WHAT? HEY, YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. OK? YOU'RE NOT ALONE. Conor: HE'S RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT ALONE. HOW ARE WE GONNA CATCH THIS THING? THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON I CAN THINK OF WHO CAN HELP. WHO? WHO DO YOU THINK? Conor: ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS THING? WELL, IF WE HAD THE FOURTH HORSESHOE, WE COULD USE THAT 4-LEAF CLEAVER LONG ENOUGH TO BAG IT AND BURY IT. OTHERWISE, NOT SO MUCH. WELL, WE'RE AS READY AS WE CAN BE. DON'T FEAR THE WIND IF YOUR HAYSTACKS ARE TIED DOWN. WAIT. WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? WE'RE AS READY AS WE CAN BE. NO, NO. THE OTHER THING. DON'T FEAR THE WIND IF YOUR HAYSTACKS ARE TIED DOWN? I KNOW WHERE THE FOURTH HORSESHOE IS. OK. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. HEY. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. EVERYONE WOULD UNDERSTAND. I KNOW, BUT I THINK I NEED IT, AND THE TOWN NEEDS IT. AMANDA. HEY, MOM, DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT HORSESHOE? I THINK I COULD USE SOME, YOU KNOW, FAMILY LUCK. THANKS, MOM. BYE, MOM. I LOVE YOU, HONEY. AAH! [CRUNCHING] [GROWLING] WHAT'S THIS? I DON'T KNOW.

TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. TO MOM. YOU SAID IT YOURSELF... I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? YOU WERE VERY YOUNG. IT WAS BLACK FRIDAY, THE BUSIEST SHOPPING DAY OF THE YEAR. AND, UM... WE LEFT YOU WITH POP SO YOUR MOTHER AND I COULD BUY YOU A GAME CONSOLE BELOW RETAIL COST. IT WAS AN... AN INCREDIBLE VALUE. DAD, WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?
