(Multicom Jingle) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] It's one of the most beloved fairytales of all time. Since its publication in 1900, L. Frank Baum's classic novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been translated into over 40 different languages and served as the basis for numerous sequels, as well as countless stage and screen adaptations, most notably the quintessential 1939 film starting Judy Garland. - She was just a wonderful girl. - How can you take your eyes off of her? She was such a great actor. - Judy did wonderful pictures, The Wizard of Oz was superior. - The first film that had an impact on me that had music in it was The Wizard of Oz. - It's riveting, I can watch it any time. - Every generation has made that thing a gigantic hit. - [Narrator] Its popularity has spawned comic books, cartoons, television series, fan clubs, conventions and the classic song that has become an anthem for dreamers all over the world. ♪ Somewhere, over the rainbow ♪ - She just brought so much to it, and you see inside her soul. - Judy Garland sang a song from within. She started from the heart of the song and worked her way out of it. - [Narrator] In a day and age of the media franchise, The Wizard of Oz is perhaps the most successful and longest-running. Its characters, Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion are as familiar to us as our own friends and family. - People, regardless of where they are on the world, know those characters, know that story. It's as if it was a legend that has been around for thousands of years, and yet it's been around for barely 100, as an original story and for far less as a film. - [Narrator] The Wizard of Oz is a timeless tale that has become ingrained in our popular culture, due largely in part to its universal message and appeal. Who hasn't at one point in their lives dreamed of some faraway, magical place in which to escape life's occasional stresses and monotony? - It's a story about finding oneself and the journey that ensues, and the discovery that the answers for which we're searching have always been within us. - Well it was a wonderful story and it was a very simple story. The whole story of The Wizard of Oz is no place like home. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] You'd have to search far and wide to find someone who has never heard of The Wizard of Oz. It is an uplifting and endearing fairytale that people return to again and again. The story of Dorothy of her incredible adventures in the magical land of Oz appeals to the child in all of us. Chances are you've read the novels growing up or seen the classic 1939 film, which is believed to be the most-watched movie ever. But what of the author of this fantastic tale? As popular as The Wizard of Oz is, few know much if anything about the man whose life was as colorful as the stories he created. (upbeat piano music) Lyman Frank Baum was born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856, the son of a wealthy businessman who made his fortune in oil. He and his seven brothers and sisters grew up on a sprawling estate where young Frank was home-schooled until the age of 12. A sickly child born with a congenitally weak heart, the timid and frail Baum spent a great deal of time alone or in bed. Mostly isolated from friends and peers, Frank kept himself entertained by indulging in one of his favorite pastimes, daydreaming. His overactive imagination would conjure up imaginary characters and places, which helped ease the loneliness of his otherwise sheltered existence. Other times, he wiled away the hours in his father's library, avidly reading among other things the popular fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Lewis Carroll. - There's no doubt that these were really the years that laid the foundation for L. Frank Baum's future storytelling talents. - [Narrator] However, his parents were concerned about his incessant daydreaming and timid nature. So at the age of 12, Frank was shipped off to military school. Being thrown into such a strict and disciplined environment after the carefree idleness of his parent's estate proved too overwhelming for the frail young boy. - Various sources have him suffering a heart attack or a nervus breakdown at this period. Whatever the scenario was, it was enough to convince his parents to withdraw him from military school after only two years. - [Narrator] From then on, Baum's parent supported and even indulged Frank's creative endeavors. Free to explore his artistic nature, Baum first tried his hand at publishing. Using the small printing press his father bought him, he and his brother produced several issues of a local newspaper. By the age of 16, young Frank Baum became a published writer. (car honking) Soon, the industrious Baum began to dabble in various careers. Throughout the next several years, he made his living as a journalist, actor, reporter, traveling salesman and even a poultry farmer. Many of these endeavors failed, leaving Frank to face years of rejection and bankruptcy. Yet, throughout it all, Baum remained optimistic and undeterred. He continued writing and at the age of 30 had his first book published. Over the next several years, Baum married and moved with his family to Chicago where he worked as a traveling salesman and reporter for the Evening Post. His imagination as vibrant as ever, Frank would always find the time to entertain his four children and the neighborhood children with his captivating fairy tales and nursery rhymes. He quickly earned himself the reputation around town as a master storyteller. It was at his mother-in-law's urging that Frank began writing down the tales he told the neighborhood children. In 1897, a collection of nursery rhymes entitled Mother Goose in Prose was published. The success of which allowed him to quit his day job and focus solely on writing. For his next book, Baum teamed up with illustrator and cartoonist William W. Denslow. The collaboration would prove highly successful. Father Goose His Book published in 1899 became the bestselling children's novel of the year. But it was their next project that would catapult them to fame and their rightful place in history. Originally titled The Emerald City, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz became an instant hit when it was first published in 1900. The enchanting story of a young girl from Kansas who gets whisked away by a cyclone to the magical land of Oz was based on fairy tales he had told to his children. - The sources that Baum used for his tales were varied. He himself acknowledged the influence of the Brothers Grimm, Lewis Carroll, but he was aiming for something a little less horrific and terrifying than the fear-based morality tales that European folklore had given to children. And with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum essentially created a new nonviolent and uplifting fairy tale that would be appealing to children. - [Narrator] It was as Baum said, "A book that aspires" "to being a modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment" "and joy are retained," "and the heartaches and nightmares left out." (pleasant piano music) As for Baum's other sources of inspiration, he drew upon many images and events from his own life. His description of Kansas came from the three years spent living in the dust bowl of South Dakota. The 1893 World's Fair in Chicago was the template for the Emerald City, and the character of scarecrow was taken from one of his own recurring childhood nightmares. - In this dream he was being chased by a menacing scarecrow which is pretty terrifying for any small child. But as an adult, he managed to take this terrifying image and exorcize it by making him into the lovable and friendly companion that we remember from The Wizard of Oz. The one that Dorothy if you remember, said that she would miss most of all. Now the Tin Man's search for a heart has been compared to L. Frank Baum's desire to have a strong and healthy heart, which eluded him in life. - [Narrator] And the name Oz? Historians claim that it simply came from a filing cabinet labeled O to Z. Thanks to Baum's enchanting story, and Winslow's vivid color plate illustrations, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was the bestselling children's book for two years in a row. In 1902, the duo set about adapting the story as a musical stage play for adults. Now simply titled The Wizard of Oz, this new adaptation debuted to rave reviews. Aside from music being added to the story, Baum made additional changes to the script. Gone were Glinda the Good Witch, and the Wicked Witch of the West as well as Toto, who was replaced by a cow named Imogene. - Toto was written out of the stage play due to the fact that it was difficult to get a trained dog to perform on cue during a live performance. - [Narrator] The play was a hit. It soon moved to Broadway, where it had a successful 293 night run. From there, it continued as a road show over the next several years, but on the heels of success came the end of a wonderful collaboration. Disagreements over the stage production, royalties, and just how much Denslow's illustrations had contributed to The Wizard of Oz's success led to a parting of company between the two men. Frank Baum now began what would be a lifetime work of continuing the Oz saga. His first sequel to the series, The Marvelous Land of Oz, was published in 1904. More sequels were to follow, as well as Baum producing and directing various stage and motion picture adaptations. Though he would occasionally grow weary of the series, and author other fantasy novels, popular demand would always find him back in the land of Oz. (pleasant music) In 1910, Baum and his family moved to California. They resided in Hollywood on the corner of Cahuenga and Yucca in a house he named Ozcot. It was from this cozy two story residence that Baum lived a quiet, idyllic life, tending to his garden and producing one new Oz book a year. In total, 13 sequels were published. Another endeavor of Baum's was to produce a traveling show called the Fairy Log and Radio Plays, which was a combination of live actors and film. Baum himself would narrate the stories from on stage while intermingling with the actors. - The Fairy Log and the radio plays which were based on Baum's first three novels were unfortunately a commercial flop, which resulted in Baum having to file for bankruptcy. - [Narrator] As part of a contractual obligation pertaining to Baum's bankruptcy, a film entitled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was released. Shot in 1910, this 13 minute short is one of the earliest surviving film versions of the novel. Frank Baum would have no input in the filming of the short, which was based more on the 1902 stage musical than the original novel. Dorothy, played by a nine year old Bebe Daniels, the Scarecrow, and Toto get swept away by a cyclone to the Land of Oz, where they're soon captured by the evil witch Mamba. (pleasant music) After destroying Mamba the witch, Dorothy and her friends make their way to the Emerald City for the wizard's retirement party. (pleasant music) In 1914, Baum formed the Oz Film Manufacturing Company, where several films based on the Oz series were made. One of the first written and produced by Baum was titled The Patchwork Girl of Oz, which was the seventh novel in the Oz series and one of Baum's favorites. The story is about a Munchkin boy named Ojo, and his journey to the Land of Oz in search of an antidote for his uncle, who was accidentally turned into a marble statue by a crooked magician. Along the way, Ojo enlists the aid of Dorothy, Scarecrow, and Patches, a ragdoll come to life. (pleasant music) - L. Frank Baum is generally credited as the director of the film, though there are some historians that dispute that. The film is notable for a couple of reasons. One, unknown producer by the name of Hal Roach who you might remember from The Little Rascals, was cast in the role of the Cowardly Lion, and then unknown comedian by the name of Harold Lloyd rounded out the cast as an extra in a grass skirt. - [Narrator] Baum's next screen adaptation in the Oz series was His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz, released the same year as Patchwork Girl. The film is considered the best of the surviving films shot at Frank Baum's production company. In it, a wicked king takes over Emerald City, and forces his daughter Gloria into an unwanted marriage with the horrible Googly-Goo. His daughter however is in love with Pon, the son of a gardener. (romantic music) (ominous music) In order to stop this infatuation, the wicked witch Mambi freezes Gloria's heart so that she can never love again. (ominous music) The scarecrow is magically brought to life, and falls in love with the evil king's daughter. Along with Pon, Dorothy, and the Tin Man, the group attempts to thwart King Krewl and Mambi's evil plans. (suspenseful piano music) - His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz, which was later reissued as The New Wizard of Oz is actually a fairly good film. It was pretty well received, but it did fail to make back its production costs. There's a surviving print that does deserve a restoration because it's actually quite a spectacle with wild adventures and really amazing for that time period special effects. (somber piano music) - [Narrator] Despite Frank Baum's hard work and high hopes for his production company, it soon proved to be a commercial failure. The films were poorly received and all had a difficult time finding distribution. By 1915, Baum had to cut his losses and shut down the Oz Film Manufacturing Company. The stress and disappointment over his failed venture took a toll on Baum's health. Already ill and plagued with heart problems his whole life, Frank Baum suffered a stroke and died at Ozcot on May 6, 1919 at the age of 62. - The man behind the curtain may have been gone, but the legacy of Oz was far from over. - [Narrator] Frank Baum's final book in the Oz series, Glinda of Oz, was published posthumously in 1920. In 1925, a silent screen adaptation was released by comedian Larry Semon. Though titled Wizard of Oz, this feature length film bore little resemblance to the book it's based on. (jaunty piano music) - Larry Semon was this comedic actor who made his directorial debut with The Wizard of Oz. A weird film that really relies on slapstick and comedic stunts to pull itself off. It introduces new characters and new plotlines. There's a love triangle between Dorothy and the Tin Man and the Scarecrow who are actually farmhands in disguise and not the actual characters of the Tin Man and the Scarecrow. Some of the other departures from the original story are that the Tin Man in this version played by a very young Oliver Hardy of Laurel and Hardy fame is actually the villain in this piece. This was a radical and strange departure from the original, and it almost never made it to the big screen. The production costs bankrupted the studio which made it, which then ceased distribution to the theaters that had booked it, and after the premiere of the film it was pretty much just shelved. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] After Frank Baum's death, his oldest son Frank J. Baum sought to continue his father's legacy. He had briefly had a hand in the ill-fated Oz Manufacturing Film Company as its business director, but took on a more prominent role as keeper of the flame after his father died. L. Frank Baum's son's attempts to continue the Oz franchise were probably made with the best of intentions, but his association with Larry Semon and the resultant film which bankrupted the Chadwick Studios that had licensed the project didn't leave him in good standing, and then his subsequent attempt to trademark the name Oz led to an estrangement between himself and his family and the lawsuit that his mother launched on him, she was so angry she eventually wrote him out of her will. - [Narrator] In 1934, Frank J. Baum sold the rights to the first Wizard of Oz book to producer Samuel Goldwyn for $40,000. MGM had been interested in making a film version of The Wizard of Oz as early as 1924, but couldn't agree on terms. But in 1938, MGM finally bought the rights from Sam Goldwyn. This was largely due to the efforts of producer Mervyn LeRoy and songwriter Arthur Freed. When studio head Louis B. Mayer asked what book would make a good movie? Both men suggested The Wizard of Oz. - Snow White and the Seven Dwarves had been such a huge box office success that they decided that all the studio heads decided that they wanted to kind of jump on that bandwagon and go into that fantasy market. Wizard of Oz was such a popular story they figured they had a built-in hit right there. - It took me five years to get somebody to do it. Sam Goldwyn owned it first, you know. We got it from him. - [Narrator] Songwriter Arthur Freed was especially eager for the rights to the Wizard of Oz story, thinking it the perfect breakthrough vehicle for MGM's young starlet, Judy Garland. - One of the most famous stories about The Wizard of Oz is that Shirley Temple was actually the first choice for the role of Dorothy. This might have been true, because Shirley Temple was a bigger box office draw at the time than Judy Garland, but she was never really considered for the part and there were two reasons for this. One, she didn't quite have the vocal chops to handle the role, and we all know that Judy Garland did. And two, she was under contract at 20th Century Fox at the time, and there was no way 20th Century Fox was gonna loan out Shirley Temple to crosstown rival MGM for a big Technicolor picture. - [Narrator] 16 year old Judy Garland was not yet the big box office draw she would soon become, but had found success after being paired with Mickey Rooney in a string of musical comedies. MGM and especially Arthur Freed were confident enough that Judy had the talent to tackle such a demanding role. - I worked with a lot of other people, but I loved Judy very much, and we loved working together, but Judy was a very special person. And a very special talent. - When you speak of Judy Garland, you speak in a very separate way. There's never anyone before her or after her that had the simplicity, the truth, the beauty, and the spontaneity, and once again that killer voice that just was so arresting and heartbreaking. - Anything somebody gave to her in movement or style, it was an innate talent to take it and put life into it and make it something wonderful. - She loved to work and she loved to sing, and she was possibly one of the greatest talents that ever lived, in my book. - [Narrator] Rounding out the cast as Dorothy's companions in the Land of Oz were Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger, and Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man. Ray Bolger was originally cast as the Tin Man, much to his displeasure. He finally convinced Mervyn LeRoy to let him play the role of Scarecrow, which was much more suited to his flexibilities. - He was what we used to say eccentric dancer. If you remember he did a lot of wobbly knees kind of thing, and in Vaudeville that was called eccentric dancing. - [Narrator] More changes in the casting came after Buddy Ebsen was forced to drop out due to being hospitalized from a reaction to the aluminum powder he wore for the part. Taking over the role of Tin Man was actor Jack Haley. Character actress Margaret Hamilton was slated to play the Wicked Witch of the West after Oscar winner Gale Sondergaard was deemed too beautiful for the part. - You're a newspaper man from New York. - How'd you guess that sister? - You was described to me. Will Wool can shoot his mouth off here all he wants, but not me or anybody else in this town. This drugstore's run by the Pravin Watch Company, and they don't want any scandal-monger New Yorkers snooping around. - Margaret Hamilton comes out as the Wicked Witch and she's I'll get you my pretty and your little dog too, and she turns away and she disappears into that red puff of smoke? It was an old magician's trick that they were using, that it was a trap door and the trap door would lower and the fire and the smoke would rise after she was safely under the stage. What happened though was they filmed it once the first time which is the one that you see in the film. They all went back from lunch. They all went to lunch and they all came back from lunch and filmed the scene again, and the second time they filmed it the trap door fell out from under her, and the fire went up too early and it started to melt the makeup on her face, which had copper in it. So her face and her hands literally started to melt, and the, someone on set grabbed her and erased her, so they started to scrub the makeup off and she ended up having second degree burns on her face and third degree burns on her hands, because of the makeup, and if they hadn't gotten the copper makeup off of her face it would've seriously seriously damaged her skin. - [Narrator] The role of the Wizard was written for comedian W.C. Fields, but the actor turned it down, finding the role too small. MGM in return found his asking price too high. The part would eventually go to actor Frank Morgan. - The jacket that Frank Morgan wears as Professor Marvel in the opening sequence in The Wizard of Oz was a jacket that the costume designer found in a thrift store, and while they were on set he had this jacket on, and he had his hands in his pocket and he pulled the lining out of the pocket and in the lining, stitched onto the lining was property of L.F. Baum. And he's like this is weird, and they tracked down L. Frank Baum's widow and said oh yeah, after he died I donated all of his clothes to this thrift shop. So a jacket that L. Frank Baum actually owned and wore is in the film. - [Narrator] The nationwide search for little people to play the inhabitants of Munchkinland would prove to be one of the most interesting casting calls in motion picture history. ♪ We represent the Lollipop Guild ♪ ♪ The Lollipop Guild the Lollipop Guild ♪ ♪ And in the name of the Lollipop Guild ♪ ♪ We wish to welcome you to Munchkinland ♪ - I happened to be working in Chicago in 1938, and through the so-called midget grapevine heard that MGM was going to film The Wizard of Oz and they're looking for as many little people as they could find. And they apparently were looking all over for more little people, and I just thought well gee that might be an interesting experience, and so I took a leave of absence from the work I was doing, and headed out to California and out to MGM Studio. And it so happened they only collected 124 little people at the time, although they had hoped to have a lot more, but so all the little people who showed up were just hired into the studio. - It was wonderful working with Judy Garland. She was a typical teenager. She was just a sweet girl. She was only 16 years old. Working on The Wizard of Oz, I thought it was great because I was only 15 years old, and I came from a small town in Alabama, and when I got the word to go out, an agent contacted me and wanted me to come out and oh I was so excited because I thought gee, coming from a small town and going to Hollywood where all the stars are, I thought that was great, and then I was gonna be in a movie. And I was gonna be a movie star in those days. (laughs) - Out of the 124 little people who were there, most of them I had worked with at other locations around the world so that it was shall we say a grand reunion for us. - Over the years there have been a lot of stories about the wild high jinks perpetrated by the little people on the set of The Wizard of Oz. In fact there were so many stories that there was a movie made about it called Under the Rainbow, starring Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher. However, most of those stories were exaggerations, and Judy Garland herself may have unwittingly started the rumors with an appearance on the Jack Paar Show. - Well what about the Munchkins? - Yeah how about that, what? (audience laughs) - The Munchkins. - The Munchkins. Yeah, well what did the Munchkins do? - Well they were... - They're little dwarves. - They were tiny. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Were they little kids or... - They were drunks. - They were little drunks? (audience laughs) - They were. - What'd they, w-w-w-w-what'd they, you got me stuttering! (audience laughs) - Many people failed to get her sense of humor, and they took her seriously, and after that there were even rumors about a young Judy Garland getting drunk with the Munchkins on the set of The Wizard of Oz. - That's a lot of BS. She was a typical American teenager, lovely gal. Afterwards is something else, but I mean during the picture she was just a little angel, you know? In fact to tell you the truth, one of the most exciting things was she got more excited about the Munchkins than the Munchkins got excited about her because don't forget there was 124 of us there, and she was always looking around, you know. Typical you know, sightseer you know, but she was a lovely gal. - [Narrator] With casting firmly in place, the next problem facing producers Mervyn LeRoy and Arthur Freed was who would direct such a lavish spectacle? Initially Mervyn LeRoy felt he was up for the task. - I produced that you know, because you couldn't do both. It was too big a picture. Mr. Mayer called me up in the office and said Mervyn, look at you can't do both. And I said yes I can, he said no you can't 'cause I'm not gonna let you. So he says you produce it, and we'll get somebody else too. - [Narrator] Directorial duties would originally go to Richard Thorpe, but Thorpe was fired after only two weeks when rushes of the film were shown to lack the magical fantasy element the producers were looking for. Director George Cukor was temporarily brought in, who made small but significant changes to the script. Among them, he changed Judy Garland's appearance to look more childlike and innocent. - To quote one of the documentary, "They made her into the Lolita of Kansas." You know the blonde wig and the... Just did not look right. So I believe Mervyn LeRoy came in and said chuck all that, and you know make her into a simple girl. She's a girl from Kansas. What are you doing to her? And that worked beautifully. - In all there would be about four directors on The Wizard of Oz. Victor Fleming is the man that everybody remembers from the credits, though he was called away at the end of filming to take over from George Cukor who was directing Gone With the Wind. The reason for that was that Cukor was fighting with Clark Gable, his star, who had a lot of pull in Hollywood at the time, and got mad at Cukor and wanted him fired, and thus Cukor was fired. So Fleming went to do Gone With the Wind, and a couple other directors came in. Eventually King Vidor, the fourth director on Wizard of Oz put the final touches on the film, but make no mistake it is Victor Fleming's name on the credits, and Victor Fleming was the director of The Wizard of Oz. - [Narrator] MGM's Wizard of Oz stayed mostly true to Baum's classic novel. One of the biggest changes made to Baum's tale was in taking the land of Oz, which was a real place in the novel, and making it an imaginary land, all a fantastic dream of Dorothy's after she's knocked unconscious. Creating the elaborate fantasy world of Oz cost MGM a staggering 2.77 million dollars, an unprecedented amount for that time. Only Gone With the Wind released that same year would exceed The Wizard of Oz's budget. - The production of Wizard of Oz took about 14 weeks and used over 60 sets. It was also filmed in Technicolor, which is a process that produces very saturated colors. Wizard of Oz is one of the first Technicolor musicals that was produced for MGM. The results were amazing in the color section. However, the cost of Technicolor was very high, so the entire production was an extremely costly affair. - When we first got on the set, there was so many people behind the camera, I couldn't believe it. There were probably three camera crews and the big cranes you know, camera up there and going back and forth, and of course the set was gorgeous. All those artificial flowers and everything. Everybody had an assistant, you know. Some guy picking up a wire, he had an assistant. - Toto was a well trained little dog, but you know what? He made more money than we did. We made $50 a week and our room and board and he made 125 a week. So he had a better agent I guess. (laughs) - [Narrator] The Wizard of Oz was finally released in August of 1939. Star Judy Garland attended the premiere with friend and co-star Mickey Rooney. The film was met with lukewarm reviews and was not the financial success that MGM had been hoping for. - We went to the premiere, and a lot of people got up and walked out and she cried. She was just torn apart, because people didn't understand it. - When Wizard of Oz was first released, from my understanding that it wasn't the phenomenal success that they hoped it would be. It made money, but it wasn't a huge success. It was moderate. But it made Garland into a star anyway. - The Wizard of Oz lost about a million dollars on its initial release. All the accolades that year went to another film, Gone With the Wind, which was nominated for a number of Oscars as was The Wizard of Oz. It was nominated for five, including best picture which it lost to Gone With the Wind. But then it went on to win the best original score Oscar and the best original song Oscar for Over the Rainbow, the song that was almost cut from the film. And then Judy Garland won a special award for best juvenile performance. - They actually originally did pull Somewhere Over the Rainbow. After the second preview of the film there were some high mucky mucks in the studio who decided that the song was slowing down the pace of the film, and they needed to pick it up. But originally, or finally someone came to their senses and decided to add Somewhere Over the Rainbow back into the film which was obviously a good decision since it's the most famous song in cinema history and an Academy Award winning song, and definitely the song that Judy Garland's most famous for. - [Narrator] Over the next couple of years, The Wizard of Oz would occasionally be reissued or turn up at various bargain matinees. But in the early days of motion pictures, films were generally shelved after its initial run. That is, until the advent of television. By the early 1950s, about one million homes had television sets and the numbers were growing. Movie theaters began to see a decline in attendance as families were now staying home to watch this new technology that brought the entertainment into their very own living rooms. Eventually, motion pictures would find their way onto the small screen. Broadcasting films on television had its advantages. For one, it could reach a larger and much broader audience. Films that had not been seen for decades were suddenly popular again, enjoyed by a new generation of movie lovers, but no other film in history would enjoy the type of renaissance that The Wizard of Oz did after its first television broadcast in 1956. - The film did well enough in a 1949 reissue, but nobody could've predicted the success that it would find in the new medium, television. In November of 1956 on a Saturday night, 45 million Americans tuned in to watch The Wizard of Oz on its national debut on television. It was broadcast in color, but most people in the '50s didn't have color sets. They had black and white sets, so they had to watch it in black and white, but still it was a hit. - It wasn't until the TV showings that it became a classic. So thanks to TV that the film is what it is today. - [Narrator] The film would not be shown on television again for another three years, but once again it was a ratings hit. Soon after, it would be re-run at least once a year, usually during the Christmas holiday. - New generations were constantly being introduced to the film via the re-runs on television, and with the advent of VCRs and DVDs, it became a pretty safe bet to say that at any given moment, somewhere someone in the world is watching The Wizard of Oz. - The Wizard of Oz was the first time that I ever saw black and white turn into color, so you can imagine, you can't imagine because that color's always been with you in your life, but I'd never seen a color film and I'm seeing The Wizard of Oz. The Wizard of Oz came out the year that I was born, so I didn't see it first run, 1939 came. So I saw it later, but it was the first time that I ever saw color, and I remember it. The magic of it being black and white Kansas and color in Oz. It was just breathtaking. It was breathtaking, I'll never forget it. - As popular as the book is, it's the film Wizard of Oz that people think of when they say Wizard of Oz. That's partly because of the magic of MGM, partly because of one of the most perfect casts ever assembled for a film, and also because of the power of music added to that story. An incredible score, an incredible team, and a film that grabs the emotions of adults and children equally. - [Narrator] The 1960s saw The Wizard of Oz go animated with the short-lived television series Off to See the Wizard. The animation trend continued with the 1974 theatrical feature Journey Back to Oz, which was based on L. Frank Baum's second novel in the series. In a bit of casting genius, the voice for Dorothy was provided by Judy Garland's daughter, Liza Minnelli. Margaret Hamilton made her return to the Oz series as the voice of Dorothy's loving Aunt Em. The next retelling of the Oz story would be the most ambitious effort since MGM's 1939 classic. (upbeat music) The Wiz was a successful Broadway musical featuring an entirely African American cast. This retelling of the Oz story was an updated and urbanized version of the tale. The play won seven Tony Awards during its successful run, including best musical and best score. In 1978, production began on bringing The Wiz to the motion picture screen. Motown Productions originally hired director John Badham to helm the picture, but Badham declined after learning that singer Diana Ross would be taking over the lead role of Dorothy Gale. - When I was first directing, I persuaded Universal to buy the rights to The Wiz that I had seen on Broadway and thought would make a wonderful musical. I never did do The Wiz. And in fact I did Saturday Night Fever instead. - Singer Stephanie Mills played Dorothy in the stage production, and it was widely expected that she would take the role in the film. However, Diana Ross managed to convince the producer of the film to cast her instead. The director, Badham, he felt that while Ross was definitely talented enough for the part, he felt that at 33 she was just a bit too old to play young Dorothy. - [Narrator] Directorial duties would go to Sidney Lumet, famous for such classics as Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. Alongside Diana Ross in this extraordinary cast was Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow. - And good luck. - [Narrator] Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man, Lena Horne as Glinda the Good Witch, and the comedic genius of Richard Pryor as The Wiz. In this soulful adaptation of the classic children's story, Harlem takes the place of Kansas, New York City is the fantasy land of Oz, and the World Trade Center towers are transformed into the Emerald City. Unfortunately, The Wiz was met with dismal reviews and was a flop at the box office. It did however earn composer Quincy Jones an Oscar nod for best score. It also introduced him to Michael Jackson, whose Thriller album he would go on to produce. - Over the years, The Wiz has actually gained a kind of cult status, and is now more popular than it was during its initial release, much like the 1939 film. - [Narrator] It seems as if there is no end to The Wizard of Oz phenomenon. There have been countless movie adaptations, movies inspired by The Wizard of Oz story, fan clubs and conventions all around the world. There's even a fan club dedicated to the red ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the MGM classic. - Well in the book they're originally the silver shoes, or the silver slippers. When they decided to make a Technicolor motion picture they decided that ruby would be a more vibrant, interesting color on screen than silver, and also easier to film. The original pair of ruby slippers they made though were filming orange, because of the Technicolor process. So they actually had to remake the slippers and they used, the actual slippers are more of a maroon color because they filmed red, bright vibrant ruby red. So if you see a pair of the original slippers like the pair in the Smithsonian, they're actually a kind of really dark red maroon color and that was the decision, that was the reason they were made that color. - The red ruby slippers. They are probably the holy grail of movie memorabilia. There are four known pairs that were used during the filming of The Wizard of Oz. Of the known pairs, one resides in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, another pair was stolen from the Oz Museum in Kansas and has yet to be recovered. The other two I believe are in the hands of private collectors. There have been books written about these slippers. Oz memorabilia is big business. There is a massive demand and fascination for all things Oz on this planet, and I think it's because the story really has touched people that much. - [Narrator] There seems no end in sight for the Oz story. Most recently, the Broadway play Wicked, based on the bestselling novel which tells the story of the witches in the Land of Oz, has become a smash hit, breaking box office records. There has also been talk about bringing The Wiz back to Broadway. The 1939 Judy Garland film has also seen a strange sort of revival in recent years. With underground theaters showing the film synced to the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. - There's no really way that they could have done it intentionally, because in 1973 when the album was released, there was no home copy of the video. It was only on TV like every once in a while. So there was really no way they could have planned that, because there's no way they could have had a copy of the film. So it's a little like, it's either they somehow had a copy of the film which was really unlikely, or it just is a really really odd coincidence. - The members of the band dismiss it as a coincidence, but it is kind of trippy to see how the album and the film link up together so seamlessly. For me it's just another example of how the film continues to find new generations of fans. Year after year, decade after decade, and it's pretty unthinkable to think that L. Frank Baum would have conceived even with his imagination that this little story that he told his kids would still be having this kind of impact on our popular culture 100 years later. It's still going on. It's like the Yellow Brick Road just goes on forever, and this is a story that I doubt is ever gonna get old. - Every time you watch it you just feel good and happy and child-like and it has that magic, that lighthearted quality to it that it's just enjoyable every time you watch it. So I think because of that, it's just an escape, you know back to your childhood, back to the world of fantasy, which sometimes you need. - At the time, you don't realize the significance that it has had over the years. I enjoy it now because of the very fact that so many children still watch it today, and it seems to have been, shall we say, an influence on the younger generation, although a lot of older people come to me and say oh I remember it when I was such and such an age to see it for the first time. So it is still a picture that is, shall we say, apparently sticks in the mind of many people. - The last time I saw a public screening of The Wizard of Oz, I found myself in the final scene, wiping away all these tears and saying why am I crying? This is ridiculous, this is The Wizard of Oz! But that simple "Oh Auntie Em, there's no place like home," gets you right here whether you want it to or not, and what I saw was that as the lights came up and everyone else around me was getting up, there were handkerchiefs, Kleenex, wet hands wiping away eyes all over the room! It affects people in that way. (dramatic music) (Multicom Jingle)
