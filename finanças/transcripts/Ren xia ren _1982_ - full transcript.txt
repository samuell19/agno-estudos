l told you not to come in the next few days. My stupid husband died less than 7 days ago. You know l couldn't wait any longer. Anyhow, you have to keep your patience until the funeral ceremony is held. l can't bother with this funeral ceremonial nonsense! No, Go away! l won't leave no matter what! You're evil... Who is it? Who are you? l'm me... l'm also him... You two sure are doing some good deeds. lt's not my fault. He forced me. l didn't force her. lf the cattle refuses to drink water, how could you lower its head? There's actually nothing between us. Nothing between you and him? So were you catching fleas on the bed? Don't lie! How could you do such a thing to me? l won't do it next time! There won't be any next time. l won't let you off. Give me your necks so l can strangle you to death. Who are you? l'm Chu Wang Lee. You fat bastard, l'll kill you! Don't be so foolish, l'll report your immoral affair to the village court. You'll be sentenced to death. Are you scared? One of them is shameless and the other doesn't keep her marital morals. A woman should be faithful to her sole husband. You accost a man while your husband's corpse is still warm. How could you do that to your husband? And of all things, right in front of his shrine! Where's the shrine? l've got it. Hold it, please. l'm not through yet. You two... Ghost... Chun! What the hell are you doing here, Chu Wang Lee? l'm doing nothing bad. l'm giving them a lesson on your behalf. l won't come if l knew that you'll come. lt's so shameful. Yes, l feel sorry for you. l'll lose my face if people knew such a scandal. Not only you. But all of your forefathers will lose their faces. You don't really have to kill them, Chun. But such a disgrace may spread out if they don't die. Adulterers are best at keeping secrets. They won't tell the public. Unless someone knows about it, no living being can tell. lf someone knew, there's a chance that it can be told. ls that a rule? Of course, lf he didn't tell then how will the others know? lf others didn't know then what's the point of knowing? Did you know about this? You mean the adultery? l know every detail of it. Would you tell people? l'm a straight forward person. l don't keep secrets. l have to tell people to make myself comfortable. So you want me to kill you! ls that what you mean? Don't misunderstand me! l only came to do this... to defend your family's reputation. No... no... What l mean is, it's not a big deal anyway. Please don't take it too seriously. l'm sorry! l promise you! l won't tell if nobody asks. No... no! l'll tell even if nobody asks me. No, no, no! l may not tell even if someone asked... Help! Somebody! Help! What's the matter? What's the matter, Grand-Uncle? What's the matter? Good morning! What happened? Grand-Uncle! What happened to him? Chu Wang Lee... Chu Wang Lee! Chu Wang Lee... Chu Wang Lee! Chu Wang Lee... Grand-Uncle, please slap me. Harder! Are you alright, Chu Wang Lee? Chu Wang Lee! How are you? Have you gone crazy? Now l get it! lt was only a nightmare. l'm alright. You played a prank on us? Get him! My leg... Catch me! Grand-Uncle... Grand-Uncle... l didn't do it, they did! Are you alright. Grand-Uncle? How can l stand up if l'm badly hurt? What wrong have our family done in the past? Each generation of our family has shared the same fate but yours have been the worst! Really? lt's true, My elder brother, and l mean, your father's father. He died right after he became a father, thus your father was born and l raised your father. Your father died right after he became a father and you were born and I raised you to adulthood. You never behaved yourself! l wonder if l'd last long enough to see you become a father and watch your son grow up. Grand-Uncle. Are you telling me that l have many fathers? l can't take it anymore. You'd better get to work. Grand-Uncle. What? Nothing. Please watch your step. Why don't you open the shop quickly? How come there's a strong smell of perfume? Are you trying to scare me? Chu. What's the matter? l've washed your clothes for you. Leave them here and you may go home. Go back home, l'm busy. Wait. These aren't mine. Why did you give it to me? l embroidered this handkerchief for you. You embroidered this for me? Why did you embroider two teals for me? These aren't teals. They're Mandarin ducks. (a symbol of conjugal affection and fidelity) Mandarin Duck? Why is one bigger than the other? You're the big one, l'm the smaller one. You're the smaller one but the big one's not me. What a pile of rubbish! lts ''Mandarin Ducks play with water''. Play with water? l'd rather you to embroider a pornography. l know you're busy during the day. lt's like l'm with you every time you go to bed at night when you see this pair of Mandarin Duck. How? Do you open your eyes when sleeping? You think l'm General Zhang Fei? Take it back, l don't want it, Go home. Yun. Grand-Uncle. Go home! You shouldn't treat her like that, Wang Lee. You've been engaged to her since you were an unborn child. You'll have to marry her. l'm going to say no to this marriage. So you better try to call it off for me. Call it off? Your father left you with nothing when he died. Luckily, he pointed his finger at Yun's mother and appointed this marriage. You've got the luck already! Call it off? Yun's been so nice to you. She's too good and l don't want her to waste her life on me. What's the point to marry an ordinary man like me? You'll be outstanding if you work hard. Pack up the gear and go to the Ma family shrine with me. Okay. Sir Ma! Although Lun Cheong left town after wiping out all of your property. but sooner or later, he will return. On every occasion like this, the mayor must be talking with this crowd of spirit tablets. Can they hear what he say? When you die, you know everything is meaningless and you will ignore whatever people say. Are you still sober, Mr. Yeung? Sing and drink happily, there's not many chances in life! But every time l see you, you are drunk. How could you pass the imperial exams? This is not so! l just don't want to go for the exam. l'll leave the empty bottle to the moon, Wealth is nothing but a floating nimbus to me. This is not so! lt's not a floating nimbus, lt's a dark cloud. Grand-Uncle, you don't have to work so hard. Let someone else do it. Why can't l work? Who can do it better than me in this village? You must learn carefully. Once l die, l'll be handing it over to you. That's going to be very soon. No...no...no...l meant to say l'll be able to learn this very soon. l already have 60% of your skills. l'll offer the incense. Thank you, Grand-Uncle. Able people should do more work. Sir Ma, l'm doing this on behalf on Ma Lun Cheong. He said he'd come home with wealth and honor. Just believe him for the time being. Chu Wang Lee, offer the tea to the predecessors. Yes. Peaceful and sunny day, dark yin and bright yang. The riches will come. Luck will arrive. Blessed by Buddha, Our posterity will do well. l shall name you Silver. Bring money to our predecessors. l shall name you Fortune. Bring fortune to our predecessors, Kowtow! Louder! Kowtow! Kowtow again! Remember your master's date of birth and recognize your master. Please be ready, Underworld guards, may you be led. Please lead them to the underworld, To rest in peace. Spirits of heaven, spirits of earth, The night is dark as the winds are high. Tis the night be late. Spirits of heaven, spirits of earth. The path has been set, return to the gates of your home! We're home! Lun Cheong died so young. Make way please, Make way! How could Lun Cheong die so young? He didn't die young, lt's you who lived long. Grand-Uncle. Grand-Uncle, Allow me to introduce, This is Ying. She is the widow of Lun Cheong. Madam Ma. This is Ying's younger brother. She is already 8 months pregnant with Lun Cheong's child. l'm glad that the Ma family is left with a descendant. Let's go inside, Grand-Uncle. After you, Please. Watch your step. l don't believe it. You must provide good service to Mr. Ma. Lady Shau is coming. Be nice to the gentlemen. Here comes the ladies. Thanks for the help, Lady Choi. No need to be so formal. Let me know if there's anything you don't like. Jade is a very nice lady and is very skillful. She may be young but she knows how to please a man. Lord Chin was here the other day. Wouldn't you say she's wonderful? Yes, she is. You could depend on her. She could even handle an 80 year old man. There's no way it can fail on you. Well? Who's going to be doing it? l don't have the time to stand here for your observation. l've got many customers waiting for me. Yes...Jade is, indeed, our hottest lady here. My neck's very sensitive, Lady Choi. Yes or no? Yes or no? He said yes. lf you like it, then come with me to the room. lt's a one night stand, lt's not like we're not getting married. l knew he's say yes. Please excuse me but l have to serve other customers. Please take a seat. Excuse me, See you later. What are you waiting for? l've got to prepare myself. Watch this for me, l'll go now. Phooey! You take this kind of medicine, People say this stuff makes you last longer. lt doesn't really help. lt's all psychological factor. Only fools will believe in it. Try one yourself. My wife's been tough on me. See you, Mr. Chow! Come back early tomorrow! l snuck out today. lt really does work. Damn it, What are we going to do? You'll be fine if you can stop thinking about it. Justice is among us. Distractions will disappear. Rivers and mountains are underneath, Here comes trouble! Bright moonlight is shining on the ground. Pluck your nuts on new years eve. Fragrant nuts, please don't bring me bad luck. Swing, swing, swing! Swing you to the bridge. Grandma calls me little baby. What do you think? You're so naughty. What's the matter? Why waste your time? Don't come here if you can't do it. l should have came to you, fatty. l'm finished, Chu. Don't touch me. What are you doing? lt's almost there. How is it? ls it working? Yes working, it's me. Why's he doing so badly? He wasn't just bad. He was imcompetant. He wasn't incompetant. He was impotent. Think about it. How could he impregnate his wife? Then something has gotten very rugged. Rugged? We're not asking you to walk on a straight road. lt's something strange. We have to invest into this affair. lnvest? We're not asking you to buy property. lts ''investigate''! Stop quarrelling! Anyway, l don't think the Ma Lun Cheong's situation is that simple. l'll have to find out the truth. How? You don't have any glue. Glue? lt's clue. Stop arguing. Look at what you've done. Let's figure out a plan. Go make the delivery, Chu Wang Lee. Yes. l've got it. Thanks for coming, mayor. Thank you. Have a seat. l'll work my hardest for the sake of the Ma family. These are the mourners we've hired. Get yourselves ready out there. Grand-Uncle, everything's ready except for the young boy and girl servants. Who knows what these brats are doing. They were... l'll go back and take a look. Excuse me! Living humans shouldn't be in the way of paper people. Don't act like you're straining to carry me. How can you make it look easy when carrying stuff over 100 kg? People will find out. Just relax. What took you guys so long? l told you to come early. Why make it so big? Don't we need to pay for the materials? lt's not us, Chu Wang Lee did it. What a wastrel! Where is he? He went to see Yun. That's unlike him. Smarten up. Don't get us involved! Let go! We're heading back to the shop, Grand-Uncle. Business has been good today. Business is more important. Hurry back! You two don't match well with each other. Couldn't even do a simple thing properly. My condolences, madam. Get some rest. You'd better post guard. l'll be outside. Behave yourself. lt's no big deal to touch my wife's butt. Who's your wife? Now, the entire villages thinks you and l are a couple. Why don't we fulfill that lie into reality? l wouldn't mind being the father of your child. Don't go. Let's have a kiss. What are you two doing? Oh no! Your affairs in bed have been caught by your husband. He talked dirty to me and tried to molest me. Please don't accuse the dead. Stop this tomfoolery, l'll bring you to the ancestral shrine right away. Smarten up or all of our previous efforts will be nullified. Alright, l know what to do. You're drunk again. Why not make myself drunk when everyone is sober? When everyone's drunk, why should l stay sober alone? lt's such a pity to die so young. Cheers! Stand still. Cheers! lnviting the Gods by the jingle of gong and drum. l'm fearless of monsters but l'm scared of leaving my spouse bereft while l'm young. Earth to earth and dust to dust. l gave my clothes to the pawn shop. And l thought l was bad, buddy. You're even worse! Swordsman of the Zu Mountain. What are you doing here, kid? You're really naughty. The incense isn't good enough, Fire! #NAME? #NAME? You're obnoxious, boy. That was rude. That paper dummy can speak. Knock on wood. Cut the nonsense. Please give your son a lesson. Why are you so naughty, you brat? You hit someone. Cut it out. Let's go. Let's go home. They're gone. You can take Mrs, Ma home for a rest. l'll take you home. Take care. Let's go home, Grand-Uncle. This way. How about l take you out to drink some wine, uncle? Good idea. Then, let's get going. That's it for today. The main entrance is close. Let's go this way. Who are you? Why is it so heavy? Lun Cheong, it's me. Forgive me for disturbing you. l'm suspecting foul play has been put on your death. That's why l came here to check your body. lf there's really anything suspicious. l will find out the truth and have your death justified. lf you insist in doing so, l may catch a severe cold. None again? Hello, Mr. Ma. l'm Chin Ba Tat from the eastern village. l mastered the ceremony for you tonight. l've been unable to make ends meet lately. That is why l require your assistance. Money and belongings are items used in this living realm. You can't make use of it anyway, So why don't you lend them to me? When l have the chance to meet you in the afterlife. l shall repay you by double. Then it is decided. That was very generous of you. Before a problem can be settled, another problem erupts. Perhaps an early bird had caught my worms? This is really frustrating. At least, l can take these. l can't open your mouth, l'd better use a pair of pliers. Wasn't it closed before? Oh my goodness! The string wasn't strong enough. l'll use another pair. l'd kill you if it wasn't for Chu's presence. That's no way to treat the deceased. Who's that? There's no one. Could it be a ghost? Don't scare yourself. Ghosts don't exist. You've got some tough teeth. l've got no choice. l don't want to ruin your teeth. l'll do it gently. l'm sorry, Lun. l didn't do it on purpose. Strange! There's not even a single bruise. Could he be poisoned? Don't fret, l'll find the truth. l'll bring my tools tomorrow and perform your autopsy. By then, l'll see if your internal organs have changed colours to see if you've been poisoned. l'd better get going. Oaf... Oaf... Not that many people knew this nickname of mine. This is Oaf. Who is it? Lun Cheong? No. You... l am the ghost of Lun Cheong. Don't be alarmed. l'm not. Tell me who killed you. Tell me! l died of natural causes. That's impossible! l don't think you died naturally. How could you impregnate your wife? You were impotent. The one who claimed to be your brother in law looks suspiciously like a crook. He must have murdered you. l've already told you. No one murdered me. lf no one had killed you, then why did you come to see me instead of resting in peace? So l shouldn't be here? That's right. Who else would help you other than me? l beg you. You don't need to beg me for help, l'll help you anyway. Why are you so stubborn? l'm not stubborn. l just wanted to help a brother. l don't have a brother like you! l know you said that because you don't want me involved. l'm not scared of the risks! l'm getting really irritated by you. l'm the one getting irritated by you! You... Say no more! Tomorrow, l will definitely dissect you. lt won't do you any good, Oaf. For the sake of a brother, where's the need to ask for benefits? l'd kill you if l really were a ghost. We may go now. We? No, l mean, l'm leaving. Let's go! Lun Cheong... Lun Cheong! So pitiful. Well? Did you convince him? l wish l could. His biggest problem is being too loyal to his friends. He's too stubborn. He'll never get it! What is he going to do? He said he wants to perform an autopsy tomorrow night. My death will be inevitable this time. Do you have any plan? l don't. You deal with him. Dealing with him is easy. We can kill him. Hey! Don't get me wrong here. Chu Wang Lee is my good friend. l don't want him killed. lf that's the case, l'll try to stop him. You'll have to find a solution. Otherwise, my death won't do you any good. Understood. You better get back to being a laying corpse. Can't you say anything better than that? What's a laying corpse? Sorry. Just go back to sleep. We'll be in trouble if someone sees you here. Now, that sounds much better. lf you and l are really married. it'd be so nice to sleep together. Please. What do you think we should do now? l've brought the tools, Lun Cheong. First, l shall cut your belly open. Then... take a look at your viscera and check your vital organs. lf you were really poisoned, give me the blessings and help me find the real culprits. lt will take time to stitch the cut if l used such a big knife. That's more like it. Alright! Chu Wang Lee? What are you doing? l wanted to perform an autopsy and see if Lun Cheong was poisoned to death. So you think he was really... Yes. l don't blame you for your suspicion. But to confirm that Lun Cheong was poisoned, l think an autopsy isn't really necessary. l know of another method without the need of an autopsy. This is a needle made of silver and this is poison. Silver needles turn black when it's soaked in poison. Look. Now which part of Lun Cheung should we test? The belly. What's the colour of the needle? Silver. lt's fine, Where else do you want to test? The throat. lt's fine as well? Where else? The brain. How can the brain be poisoned? lf viruses can go anywhere, so can poison. Hold it. What are you doing? l just want to show Mr. Chu that Lun Cheong was not poisoned to death. Lun Cheong is dead and you dare to abuse his body. There were suspicious circumstances about his death. That's why l have to check his body. Ma Lun Cheong is my husband, l cannot allow you to do this. l knew this man very well. He couldn't have impregnated you. He was impotent. That's right. l am not pregnant with Ma Lun Cheong's offspring. lt has now come to the point where l confess the truth. The fact is, l've been raped. l originally wanted to attempt suicide. Lun Cheong saved me and even married me as his wife. Although there was no sexual connection between us. he has been very good to me. So l told myself that l must live with him for the rest of my life. But then he fell ill and died. ln order to repay his kindness, l decided to go ahead with the baby and he'll become Lun Cheung's foster child. And the Ma family shall never become extinct. Once the child is born, l will leave. The dead cannot bear witness now and you can say whatever you want. Lun Cheong once told me l could count on you. But l can't believe you would say such a thing. lf l continued in staying alive, it would impair the reputation of the Ma family. Put it down. Don't do this. Let me die! This won't solve anything. Please forgive me, madam. lf you hadn't explained, l wouldn't understand. But since you've explained, l understand now. No wonder when Lun Cheong came to me in a dream. he seemed to be hiding something from me. Please think of your unborn child before you do anything stupid. l see your belly has gotten big. Why are there two belly buttons? They're twins! Lun Cheong. She's fine. l'm glad l haven't started operation on Lun Cheong. Should we test his brain? There's no need for it. Mrs. Ma, if you run into any difficulty, just let me know if you're in need of help! Thank you. Take care. You're stupid but at least, you were a true friend. Are you alright? Lun, your funeral is on tomorrow. Don't leave us behind after you get your father's antiques from his grave. l'm not that kind of person. l will keep my word. Once l sell the stuff, l will divide 40% to you people. You may now rest in peace. Knock on wood. Good night. l've been waiting for you. Why so late tonight, mayor? Please excuse us. What happened to your head? l fell on the way. What's with the urgency this late at night? Well, it's like this. When Old Master Ma was still alive, he stored a sum of money in my bank depositry. He asked me to hand over this fund to Lun Cheong's child if he had one. Otherwise, l can donate it to charity. Once your child is born, l'll be handing the fund over to you. How much is there? l've already checked. lt's more than 100,000 taels including interest. 100,000 taels? These antiques in the grave must be priceless. But Lun Cheong told me that his father spent all his money to buy mortuary objects. Old Ma wouldn't do a thing like that. Those antiques in the grave are all cheap items. lf Sir Ma didn't do it on that very day, how would it give Lun Cheong the motivation to work hard? Then, the ancestors of the Ma family... The values of the Ma's family have been hard working and are very careful with money. Sir Ma won't squander the money. l'll donate half of it to the village for public welfare. l think Lun Cheong would be feel relieved in the afterlife. lt's such a good fortune for Sir Ma to have a daughter in law like you. lt's getting late and l am feeling tired. l'll take my leave now. You should get some rest now. lt turns out that there is no antique in Sir Ma's grave. However, there is a huge estate left behind. ln that case, there's no need for Lun Cheong to be buried. You're wrong. He must be buried. And he shall never leave the grave. You mean... Everyone believe he is now dead. lf he stays dead, you know where the 100,000 taels is going to. You mean... Who are you? Why do you want to kill me? l didn't know he was so tough. He almost killed me. Get everything tidy. The spirit passes through Wu Sai Cavern. The soul goes across the Noi Ho Bridge. Lay to rest and stay at the Nine Springs. Death is a sore. Ma Lun Cheung also known as Ma Lucho was born in the city of Wuzhou in the Guangxi province on the first year of the reign of Qing Emperor Xian Feng (1851). He died at the age of thirty four. He was diligent in his studies and respected his teachers. This poem made by Mr Yeung is not bad. He is, indeed, a good scholar. This is a eulogy, not a poem. You smart aleck! An adult illustrate. You shouldn't be the smart aleck either! lt's ''illiterate'', not ''illustrate''. Concentrate on your work, You're being needed here. Lun Cheong... Be careful with your baby, lt's our wealth. Calm down, Madam Ma. Start crying! Death is a sore. The good die young. A hard working man who had such a misfortune. Maybe you were too good to stay on earth. Death is a sore. You have gone. but little do you know that you've broken many hearts. May you rest in peace. Do you miss us at all? l must be getting old. Let me salute you with this drink and hope that you will remember us. Maybe the date of his birth and death are wrong, l'll be forced to do this. Lift the coffin. Why? Why? Be careful. What's the matter? lt's the ghost of Lun Cheong. Don't worry. He can't get close to us while l'm around. Let's go. Even as a ghost, l'm useless. What can l do? Yes... l'll look for Oaf. Oaf, it's me! Lun Cheong? You're such a powerful ghost. Of course, l'm powerful. l can't rest in peace. Can't rest in peace? What's wrong with you? Stop playing tricks on me! Last time, you told me that you died of natural causes. This time, you say you can't rest in peace. Do you think l'm an idiot? You've already departed this mortal realm. Why don't you stop the tomfoolery? You'll only scare people that way. You've harmed your neighbours when you were alive and giving harm to other ghosts when you're dead. Trust me, l was really murdered. Alright. We were good brothers and l've always cherished old relationships. l'll burn some offerings for you. You can now rest in peace. Leave your wife to me. l'll take good care of her for you. Now go back to the afterlife. Let me explain everything for you, Oaf. And that's how it is... How can you do something like this? Do you call yourself a man? That's why l'm now a ghost. What do you want me for? l want you to avenge my death. Revenge? Don't you think you were wrong as well? Don't mix it up. Revenge and wrongdoings are two different things. A villain can revenge for his murder. Please leave me out of your mess. l wouldn't be bothering you if l can do it myself. Oaf, my brother! l don't have a brother like you. Get lost. Did anything get you upset, buddy? No! Please, You've got to help, Oaf. Get lost. Oaf! Oaf! Fine! lf you won't help me, then l'll disturb you. How dare you molest me, fatso. l'll take you to jail! Sorry, lady! The BBQ pork buns tastes good, buddy! lt's hot and fresh. l'm okay. Sorry about that. Why you stop fooling around? You've just wrecked my stall, fatso, lt seems like you're here to make trouble. l didn't do it! l have nothing to do with this. You make that claim with that cheeky look. l ought to beat you up! Don't! Don't ever let me catch you here again, fatso! Thanks. Haven't you had enough? Stop fooling around, will you? l wasn't fooling around, buddy. l slipped on the floor. You think l wanted this? That's right. He doesn't want it. Why are you heading inside? What else can a man do in a toilet? Do you take late night snacks in there? You weren't being nice to me, Oaf. You didn't burn a prettier looking female servent for me. What's the point of burning a pretty one for you? lt'd be a waste anyway. l beg your pardon, Oaf. l poured ridicule on you, so what? Do you want to upset me? Yes. You'll have to do better than that. l'll kill you if l catch you. You wouldn't treat me like that. l knew you won't. Would l? l didn't do it. You could scare people like that! What have l done wrong? You don't need to be so angry. Fine, l'll leave you alone. lt's all yours. You'd better be careful now or he'll blame it all on me. Be careful. Please. Come down! What now? Do you have something to say to me? No... no... Then, why'd you tell me to come down? Well? Come down if you're not a coward! What kind of cowardice are you talking about, buddy? l'm not your friend, Ma Lun Cheong. What? He's the coward. What? You called me a coward? l'm dying! Don't worry. You're still alive. l broke my leg. Your leg isn't broken. lt's just a minor injury. You fell from the top of the stairway. Of course, it's going to hurt. Let me carry you back up. l was too impulsive. l'll carry him. l'm in pain. lt's so painful... What's with the racket? lt's all my fault. l shouldn't have gone to the toilet. l should waited until dawn before l go out to urinate. Then, nothing would have happened. Thank you. Are you refusing to leave? How could l leave unless you're willing to help me? Fine! Stay here if you're really that capable. Trying to scare a ghost? You don't have the power yet! Don't bother me... lt's only me. Chu Wang Lee's been possessed. Wasn't it you? Stop joking with me. Look! What do you think? lt does look like it but l think he's gone insane. Get up! He has almost broken everything. What are we going to do when Grand-Uncle returns? l think we should go back to sleep and disregard it. Go to sleep. l'm right here. l saddle up on my horse and l ride into the city. This is fun! Come! Have you gone crazy, Chu Wang Lee? Why did you break everything in here? lt's not my fault. That damned ghost caused it! Where? There's nothing. There's no ghost. The old man can't see me, Oaf. You can cause as much trouble as you like, Chu Wang Lee. l'll punish you later. Grand-Uncle! Grand-Uncle said he's going to punish you later. Does that make you happy now? A little bit. Grant me the power, o' heaven and earth! Now, everyone thinks l've gone crazy. l beg you. You'll be fine as long as you promise to help me. l'm the one with patience. Not you. l'll beat you up! No! Don't! This vine is for hitting ghosts, Each hit shortens you by 3 inches. You'll soon be finished after a few more hits. Please stop, l'll leave. l was wrong. So, now you admit you're wrong? l admit you're not a friend, l shouldn't have been a friend to you. l thought an old friend would help me avenge my death. But it seems that you're a man without the concept of justice and morality. Even if you came to Justice Pao for your murder, he wouldn't give a damn, especially when you've... You've been murdered? You wouldn't believe me even if l told you. Forget it, l'll leave. Wait! l believe you've been murdered. l thought something was strange at your funeral when l couldn't break your burial brick. What happened? Tell me the story. Will it work? No problem. lt will expedite the delivery. lt'll always work. lf this really works. then please increase the dosage. Right. You and l both want the money sooner before leaving this place. l accept my punishment but l'd hate to see them get away with murder. What do you think? Right. That's why l wanted Oaf to give me a helping hand. Can he help you? Please don't order me to kill, Grand-Uncle. l'm incapable of violence. You don't have to do it yourself. l only need your outfit. My outfit? He's not asking your clothes, He's asking for your body. ls it safe, Grand-Uncle? Pipe down! What if he doesn't return the outfit back to me? Will l get into big trouble? Lie down. Please. Peaceful and sunny day. Dark Yin and bright Yang. Behold the heavens. May all of those leave the afterlife guard us from the devils. Follow the path of the Big Dipper! Burn incense of worship! Out with Chu Wang Lee's soul from his body. The soul shall last and die with the light. No harm, no fear. Follow my order, With the integrity of the universe, we're able to solve all obstacles. Get ready, Lun Cheong. Ready as ordered. Now! Thank you, Grand-Uncle. Make sure you come back before dawn, Ma Lun Cheong. Otherwise, Chu will die. My life's in your hands now, buddy. Don't worry, l'll be back in no time. l'll go now, Grand-Uncle. Don't make a mess out of my outfit! l thought l was still a ghost. What do you want, Chu Wang Lee? l'm not Chu Wang Lee. l'm Ngau Ma Kan. He reminds me of someone. He does. But who? Chu Wang Lee? Me? No! Who are you? l'm Ma Lun Cheong. l merely borrowed the body of Chu Wang Lee. You people have been cruel to me. lt won't work on me this time. Grand-Uncle... Grand-Uncle... the candle is running out! What time is it? Just past midnight. What could be holding him up? The tinder! Don't kill me, Ma! l'll burn you offerings for reincarnation. Reincarnation? Save it for yourself! Killing you was actually my wife's idea. l didn't want to kill you! l know. She won't get away from it. The only thing is you left before she did. Luckily for me, l ran fast. Otherwise, l'll be forever doomed if your pants touched my head. To hell with you. Die! You bitch! Come here if you dare! Come here if you're capable! l'll cover you up! Come here! l dare you! Dawn is breaking. l must not tangle with her. Otherwise, the fat oaf will die. No, l must return to Grand-Uncle for a solution. l think he left. l should think of a plan to leave this place. But if l leave now, l'll be left with nothing. No matter what happens, l must stay. What took you so long? Why did you come back like this? Where's my outfit? The bitch used underwear to strip me off. l can't retrieve it. Why didn't you get it back? l can't because l'm a ghost. Only humans can do so. Who could get it back? Grand-Uncle! Don't count on me! l couldn't get there before dawn. Then, l'll die. We can carry Grand-Uncle over there. Then let's hurry! Come, Grand-Uncle. l'll get the light. l'll get it for you. Be careful. l'm scared. Let me down. Grand-Uncle can't get through. What's wrong with you? l'm not one of you! You better take care of me. Don't let the light go off. Grand-Uncle! Be careful! You bitch! l'll strangle you to death! Never mind her. Get my outfit first! That's right. Hurry! Follow me! Die miserably, you bitch! Where is it? Where's my body? lt's gone. How is it missing? What do we do now? l'll look around for you. Don't you know it's late, Grand-Uncle? l'm here to save lives. There's no one for you to save. Scram! Get lost! Not here. The evils we bring upon ourselves are the hardest to bear. Will she die, Grand-Uncle? Why should we save this sinner? What about the infant, Grand-Uncle? lt's sin. Hurry, Otherwise, we won't make it. Go! Where could it be? She buried me alive! Here it is! Come on. Hurry up! Start digging. l see it. Good. Drag him out. ls it alright now, Grand-Uncle? No it's not. The light has gone out. l'm sorry, Oaf. Perhaps this was your fate. l must go now. l'll wait for you in hell, Oaf! He's gone just like that, Grand-Uncle. Look at yourself. How could this happen to me, Grand-Uncle? l beg you. Please save me! Stop screaming, l'm thinking. Hurry up or l'll be finished. Find a solution for me, Grand-Uncle. Save me. Please save me! l can't think of a solution right away. Stop rushing me! Chu Wang Lee... Why did you leave without a word, Chu Wang Lee? Mao Mao. How did Chu Wang Lee die so suddenly? l'm not sure. l think he was possessed by an evil spirit last night. He died before l woke up this morning. l'm glad we weren't sleeping here last night. Don't be so sad, Yun. You have my conditioning. lt's ''condolences'' not ''conditioning''. A person's death can be weightier than Mount Tai or lighter than leather. Lighter than a feather not leather. Don't say it if you don't know how to say it. Quiet, you two. lt'll only get worse if you keep talking. She wasn't crying that horribly just now. You teased me first. Get lost, you two. Did Chu say anything before he died? Yes. What did he say? He wanted me to help him. Then, why didn't you? He died before l could do anything. Chu! Why couldn't you wait a bit longer? lt's all over now. Not really, l have a plan. lt's never been tried so l don't know if it'll work. What plan, Grand-Uncle? l'll need someone who's willing to make a sacrifice. What are you doing? Nothing... Don't worry. No one needs you two to make a sacrifice. You'd be useless even if you were willing enough. We need someone closest to him. Someone like,,, Like whom? His wife. Why didn't you marry me earlier, Chu? Can l marry him now? Do you really want to save him? You'll have to think about it. Of course, it'd be great if he's saved. lf you can't save him, you'll be widowed forever. l've said this to myself before, lf Chu doesn't marry me while he is alive. then l would become a nun. Very well, l'll give it a try. Proceed with the wedding ceremony. lsn't a wedding in the bride's house like inviting a pervert? lt's to re invite the groom back into his shell. Are you sure that's a rooster? lt's not a good omen to get a castrated chicken for a wedding. No way. When l caught it, there were many hens following me. Please. Bow once before the god. Bow a second time before the parents. Bow before your spouse. Send to bridal chamber. The seventh day after a man has died is known as the ''First Seven''. His soul will come out on ''First Seven''. There's a breath stored in the deceased. lt is the main essence of a man. When this breath leave the corpse, it will become a cold wind which is its spirit. You should place a lamp behind the coffin. Make it as bright as possible, So that his spirit will recognize the way back from the ''Yellow Spring''. Place a bowl of rice near the coffin. Then, feed him and make him fit enough for travelling. Come back soon, Chu. l'll wait for your return. On the fourteenth day, which we call ''Back Evil''. Back Evil is the date where the soul returns home. Put a reed and a ladder in five colors right under the chimney. Yes. Chu Wang Lee will not return alone. He'll be accompanied by ghost guards. He can only stay here for a short period of time. When time runs out, the guards will take him away in chains. lf he is late. the guards will hit him with their black rod. That's why you need to have the offerings prepared. Burn hell bank notes as much as you can. You must treat the guards well. Make them comfortable. They love eggs and wine. You should make hard boiled eggs and remove the shell. Have them placed in wine. l almost forgot to tell you. The soul may turn into a beetle or an insect when it enters the house. There are many insects at night. How would l identify him? Put lime on your rooftop. lf an insect has lime on its legs, then it is definitely Chu Wang Lee. l see. Another thing. Once you've caught the insect, you have to... to... What do l have to do? Turn around. Wrap it with your tampon. Wrap it so the guards have no other way to see him. Hang in there till dawn. And Chu Wang Lee will have a chance to resurrect. His life now depends on you. l can make it. This family is generous. They have prepared a good meal for us. There's so much food. This is fantastic! There's some eggs. We've got some as well! l can't get to them. Pour the wine so we can get to the eggs. Don't be ridiculous! lt's not like we can't drink the wine if we ate the eggs. Pipe down! Drink the wine first and then, eat the eggs. Great! l have you at long last! You're drunk! lt feels like everything is spinning. You two are lousy drinkers. lf you're Chu, please crawl onto my palm. Chu, it's really you! No matter what, l can't let them take you away. lt's time to go. Where did Chu Wang Lee go? Chu Wang Lee... Chu Wang Lee... She must have hid him away. We'd better show ourselves and demand it back. Unhand Chu Wang Lee over to me, Mrs, Chu! l don't understand what you are talking about. lf you don't hand him over, then don't blame us for being rough. Don't come near me! Forget talking to her! Get after her! Give her hell! Let her know we mean business. Hand him over. l won't hand him over, no matter what! Pick her up. Let me go! Throw her to the door. Well? lf you don't hand him over, we'll carve Chu Wang Lee's corpse into pieces. No! Let go! Leave him alone! Go! Go! Let go, Leave! This girl is tough. lf we can't get her settled, we'll head back to find a solution. This is no good. She's wrecked the stairway. She has even blocked the chimney. Let's find another exit. lt's hot! l beg you. Please let us go! No way. Mrs. Chu, didn't you know that whipping a ghost with an osier would make them shorter by three inches? Now you're burning us with fire. Please do us a favor. Then you should do me a favor. Forget about Chu Wang Lee. lt's our responsibility to catch all spirits to see King Yama (The King of Hell). Man dies and becomes a ghost. Ghosts live in hell. This is natural order. Even human law has exemption subject to sympathy. Chu is the only son in his family. He died only to avenge the death of his friend. Tell that to Yama! lf he must be brought back, he should wait until the Chu family have an offspring. Alright, lt's a deal. lt's almost dawn. Please let us go or we'll be terminated. Alright. Let's go. Didn't l die? l've finally saved your life, Chu. You saved me? Why am l at your house? Not mine. This is our house. Ours? We've just married. How did it happen? Grand-Uncle told Mao Mao to find a chicken for your wedding. What did you say? Did he go into the bridal chamber for me as well? How could he possibly help you with that? lt's better to do it ourselves. Chu, the guards have said that they'll take you away once we have children. Now l know the principle that one does not have to live long. lt's more important that one must live happily. Let's go for it!
