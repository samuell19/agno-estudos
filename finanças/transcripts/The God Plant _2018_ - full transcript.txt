[Source: Youtube Caption] when most of us hear the words weed or cannabis we imagine happy hungry stoners unwashed and lazing about in the sofa playing computer games or watching TV not a care in the world as they waste their life and brain into oblivion sadly this has become the popular image and stigma surrounding the plant even though research has shown that cannabis has hundreds of active compounds is relatively safe to consume and can treat or even cure thousands of medical ailments including cancer cannabis remains illegal or controlled all over the world the media playas with stories about the harm cannabis causes and how it induces psychosis and even suicide but neglect to highlight the full details to this day not one person has died from an overdose of cannabis it has been theorized that it would take over a thousand pounds of cannabis being consumed within an hour to have a fatal effect since this is impossible we will not be seeing any deaths difficult with the cause of death marked as cannabis overdose any time in the future cannabis or as non psychoactive form hemp has been used by humans for thousands of years and until not so long ago was a plant prized amongst all others so why in this day and age does such a useful plan cause such controversy why in the UK and so many other countries around the world is it illegal in this documentary we will delve into the past and discover the evolution of the cannabis plant and the endocannabinoid system that evolved within mammals eventually becoming perfect partners we will explain how our ancestors used the plant and her empires were forged with hemp as the main driving force most importantly of all we will look into the medical benefits of cannabis and how one plant has and can again change the world [Music] [Music] you our story begins well at the beginning 13.7 billion years ago a phenomenon we now call the Big Bang began this single event was the genesis of all matter and life in the universe within 10 to the minus 34 of a second that's a hundredth of a billionth of a trillionth of a second in age a singularity that seemed to pop out from nowhere had expanded by 90 times its size and created all the elementary particles needed to build a universe during the first three minutes of the universe the light elements were born in a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis temperatures cooled from 103 - Kelvin to 109 Kelvin and protons and neutrons collided to make deuterium an isotope of hydrogen [Music] fast forwarding through thirteen point two billion years and we observed the formation of the stars and then the galaxies the Milky Way is formed and roughly 4.3 billion years ago on a far-flung spiral our home planet Earth starts to form a fiery ball that will soon host and take part in all of human history millions and billions of years past the planets cool and the oceans form at an estimated 3 billion years BC single-cell structures formed in the oceans then multi-cell then small creatures we will stop at 600 million years BC this is where our particular story begins the creature you're looking at here is the humble sea squirt the sea squirt has evolved within itself the endocannabinoid receptor system to control how much water goes in and out of its siphon the endocannabinoid system was only recently discovered in mammals in 1992 by dr. rafael michelin as well as researchers will and yvonne and dr. liu Mahan's they discovered the first naturally occurring endogenous cannabinoid or endocannabinoid an and amide an and amide is a fatty acid neurotransmitter and was named from the sanskrit word an adder meaning joy or bliss previously in 1963 dr. raphael michelin discovered the structure of Delta 9 THC and in 1980 a dr. William Devon discovered the protein receptor sites cb1 and cb2 in the brain and throughout the body although I was surprised that the amount of work that's currently being done and has been done on what's called the human in the cannabinoid system and it may not be known that all humans produce cannabis if you like in their brain it's a natural ducked called the endocannabinoid system we produce cannabis like compounds which have a profound effect on many aspects of our behavior on pain on motor control movement control on a growth and adaptability of the brain potentially on cancer or mood on memory it's a fascinating system and this is the the largest neurotransmitter network in our body that was only discovered in 1988 so it's a it's a relatively speaking a very recent knowledge and the endocannabinoid system consists of receptors there are two types of receptors identified so far except is in the brain in the immune system in our gut and any most organs in the body the receptors is the first thing the second elements are ligands or microscopic amounts of chemicals or fats oils or fats which are called endocannabinoids and the third element is the endocannabinoid system there are enzymes the enzymes are responsible for manufacturing the endocannabinoids in the first place we'll all help him with them to break down so these three components working together are the endocannabinoid system and the reason it's called the endocannabinoid system is because these cantonese cannabinoids these endocannabinoids are remarkably simply not exactly the same but they're remarkably similar to the cannabinoids defined in the cannabis plant an and amide fits the cb1 and cb2 receptor sites like a key in a lock as well as being a mood enhancer an and amide helps control height weight and reproduction amongst other things in the body leaving the sea squirt behind we move forward 566 million years and time 234 million years bc here in the mountains of kazakhstan the cannabis plant has evolved from humilis lupulus are more commonly known as the hops plant the flower of which is still used to this day in the brewing process for beer evolving at such high elevation present the plant with many unique environmental pressures to better survive the high UV radiation levels low-oxygen and increased predators cannabinoids such as THC were used to retain water reflect sunlight and ward off predators tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the most famous cannabinoid and the one responsible for the plants psychoactive effect THC was discovered by dr. Raphael Missoula in the 1960s by separating the compounds of the plant and testing each individually on animals and then humans noticing that only one gave a sedative effect shulam discovered the psychoactive compound responsible for the marijuana hi the naturally occurring chemical compound THC found in the cannabis plant has a different chemical makeup but fits the cb1 and cb2 receptor sites perfectly magnifying the mood enhancing effect normally caused by indigenous cannabinoids such as an and amide it is not just an and amide and THC that act on these receptors there are many other cannabinoids and endocannabinoids that act directly or indirectly such as 2 AG CBD CNB and THC a amongst others and each has a different effect on the body so the cannabis plant and the reason the cannabis plant has a therapeutic response and living organisms has a physiological impact on users creates an emotional response has to do with the fact that it has multiple unique biologically and physiologically active compounds in the plant the two most prevalent compounds that we find in the cannabis plant are tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the other being CBD cannabidiol now they are far from the only active constituents in the marijuana plant but again they're the most they're the ones that we find most prevalent in the plant over the next thirty four million years man will evolved from primates and nearly 99% of all species that ever existed have been wiped out 8,000 years BC the plant has gone through many changes and a relatively new species roughly 250,000 years old has become the top predator and the first to drastically manipulate its environment through thought desire and determination a major leap forward will be their agriculture of crops this will lead to an explosion in technology the ability for humans to live in groups larger than 150 and is the basis of modern civilization for now we are in an ancient village located in an area of modern-day Taiwan from this village archaeologists have found hemp cord used in pottery hemp refers to strains of cannabis sativa that have been bred specifically for its fibres and not for its psychoactive effect this is the oldest known use for the plant and marks the beginning of human agricultural crops in 1977 Carl Sagan stated that marijuana may actually have been the world's first agricultural crop leading to the development of civilization itself 6000 BC China cannabis is recorded for its seeds and oil used in food 5000 BC India stems were used for fiber to make cloth it's fruit for food and oil and its resin for medicine [Music] 2737 BC Emperor Shang yang of China is recorded for prescribing marijuana tea for the treatment of malaria rheumatism gout to help with the sharpening of memory increased eloquence and the stimulation of appetite the plant's popularity as a medicine spreads throughout Asia the Middle East and down the eastern coast of Africa ancient physicians prescribe marijuana for everything from pain relief to earache to childbirth throughout the world cannabis is quickly becoming a wonder treatment for hundreds of ailments and disorders its popularity seems unstoppable 1550 BC Egypt by 1550 BC ancient Egyptians were very aware of the medical properties of cannabis in some ways way surpassing our modern knowledge the APUs papyrus was written around this time period and is one of the oldest complete medical tax discovered so far the book mentions medical compounds containing hemp for many medical problems including inflammation glaucoma hemorrhoids epilepsy - wave of depression and other psychological problems and even in the treatment of cancer it was noted the cannabis was not a cure but treatment to help with the symptoms of the ailments the mummy of ramasees ii that was excavated in 1881 was found to have traces of cannabis in its remains since then many mummies that have been exhumed have shown similar traces of the plant in their system indicating that cannabis was part of the culture and everyday life in ancient Egypt [Music] say hat the goddess of wisdom is depicted here with a colorful cannabis leaf above her head these depictions date back from thousands of years ago 207 BC China the hyung dynasty periods hemp was being mixed with mulberry tree bark to make a low-cost durable paper used by the masses the Old Testament mentions cannabis in the recipe for the holy anointing oil Exodus 30 verses 22 to 23 the healer of a local renown will infuse 9 pans of a plant known in Aramaic is Kiana blossom the fragrant came in to about six quarts of olive oil along with essential extracts of myrrh cinnamon and kasaya Kiana bottom has been translated to mean cannabis rendered from the traditional Hebrew word cannabis interestingly the first time the word cannabis 'm is mentioned in the bible is in relation to Moses and the burning bush when God gives him the recipe for the holy anointing oil the Roman Empire traded in hemp they imported it from the far-flung corners of the Empire and distributed it around the world they used it for rope sells clothes paper food and medicine amongst others the demand was such that the whole Empire was in constant production and could never produce enough the power of the Roman Empire made the plant commonplace across the globe ad a hundred and sixty Greek physician Claudius ghilane writes for the first time in Europe about the plants psychoactive effect : noted that ham cakes if eaten in moderation produced a feeling of well-being but taken to excess they led to intoxication and dehydration [Music] 8400 hemp is cultivated in the UK with the fading of the Roman Empire Europe begins to grow its own hemp to replace the Roman imports the Vikings used hemp in nearly all aspects of life from clothes to cells and their ships 900 AD Arabs learned techniques for making paper using the same techniques that the Chinese used thousands of years before them by the 12th century this paper making knowledge was taken to Europe as early as the 10th century the Persian medical writer Alam Misaka recommended that the juice of the hemp leaves be poured into the nose to prevent seizures in the 15th century the polymath Ali Berardi claimed that the Epilepsy of the Sun of the caliphates Chamberlain was successfully treated with cannabis resin 1533 England King Henry the eighth issues a royal proclamation that farmers must put land aside for the growth of hemp countries such as India China and the African colonies are chosen for the hemp growing potential as the British Empire grows and the demand for ropes sails fishing line oil paper medicine and clothes increases 1753 the Swedish botanist Carlos Linnaeus names the plant cannabis for the first time more specifically cannabis sativa from the Latin meaning cultivated he based the word on cannabis an old Greek word for hemp in 1764 medical marijuana appears in the New England dispensary in 1840 Britain sir jr. Reynolds chief physician to Queen Victoria prescribes medical marijuana to the Queen to aid with her menstrual cramps in Victorian Britain medical cannabis was being used for ailments such as muscle spasms rheumatism and epilepsy studies in 1840 by French doctor jacquees Joseph Marui found that marijuana suppresses headaches increases appetite and aided people to sleep by 1850 in America cannabis based medicines are available the u.s. pharmacy pedia lists its use for over hundred separate illnesses and diseases including pain management as a cold treatment neuralgia tetanus typhus cholera rabies dysentery alcoholism opiate addiction anthrax leprosy incontinence gout compulsive disorders tonsillitis insanity excessive menstrual bleeding and utrom bleeding amongst others Cannabis a simple plant classified as a weed a plant that has an almost symbiotic relationship with humans we dispersed it around the planet and it repays us with medicine food oil and strong natural fibers a plant that has shaped the modern world like no other before it is about to be systematically made illegal around the Western world thousands of years of cultivation medicine paper and clothing is about to come to an end along with a safe powerful medicine by 1914 in America in response to the influx of Mexican immigrants who use cannabis for its psychoactive properties rather than the medical use the Harrison Act in the u.s. defined the use of marijuana as a crime by 1915 cannabis begins to be prohibited for non-medical use all across the United States by 1927 the prohibition is complete if we look at the origins of cannabis prohibition in this country they really begin with the stigmatization of certain races that were believed to be using cannabis and even today those stereotypes continue to exist they continue to be perpetuated this is really part of a larger cultural and class warfare in our society and actually has very little to do with marijuana itself in 1928 recreational use of cannabis is banned in Britain cannabis was made illegal in the United Kingdom on the 20th of September 1928 as an addition to the dangerous drugs act 1920 however doctors were able to prescribe cannabis for medical use until exactly 43 years later when on September 28th 1971 the misuse of Drugs Act was introduced in 1936 the American propaganda film reefer madness was produced to scare the American youth away from cannabis the film incited that cannabis causes madness and turns men into rapists [Music] [Applause] here's a word of warning to both old and young pay heed to me before it is too late there's a vicious plan that looks so innocent but it stem comes from the words of hey marijuana the devil's flower if you're using marijuana and made them 1937 US Congress passes the marihuana Tax Act which criminalizes the drug in response William C warwood testifying on behalf of the AMA told Congress that quoting the American Medical Association knows of no evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug and warned that a prohibition loses sight of the fact that future investigations may show that there are substantial medical uses for cannabis his comments were ignored by Congress as part of the testimony for Congress to pass the 1937 Act derived from articles and newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst who had a significant final interest in the timber industry that manufactured his newspaper in 1941 cannabis is removed from the u.s. farmer Superior and its medical use is no longer recognized in America so where are we now present day the plant is still illegal across most of the world pharmaceutical companies fill the medical gap with synthetic and toxic drugs oil is being pumped from the oceans our paper is inferior and hemp can produce four times the yield in a comparable time frame the worst of these is the removal of a safe medicine 600 years ago the Arabs were treating childhood epilepsy successfully with cannabis today in a world of overwhelming technological advancements our children and adults are placed on a plethora of toxic drugs that have little to no effect and in most cases are highly addictive [Music] my name is Charlotte Caldwell and I have a little boy called ballet who has a condition called intractable epilepsy and he also in the highest spectrum of autism Billie intractable epilepsy is just that his seizures cannot be controlled by epilepsy medications or or by diet he's also a starless epileptic which means that when belly goes on to a seizure he can't come back out in his own any type of seizure and the child is a very very dangerous but in Belize case the the status epilepticus bail is then required a rescue med each time that human done to establish seizure and he also goes below and requires oxygen he also the an advanced stage was just developed this where he would only take a seizures at night which again is a real dangerous form he was taking him in asleep I tried to access the an evaluation or an urgent medical evaluation here in our own country but to no avail was told it would be six nine months witnessed in September in March 2006 when Valley was sent home to die the first time with his condition epilepsy I had found at that stage what's called as a pediatric hematologist in Chicago called Professor nordley and he had saved Billy's life after numerous tests when we arrived in California and there was numerous tests on valet they discovered a lesion on his left temporal lobe they looked at the lesion and through many different scans the lesion the the left temporal lobe actually controls your speech and memory and in Belize case it would have been most likely if they were to proceed with surgery that bully would the would have had to have removed all of his left temporal lobe which would have meant that Billy would have lost his speech and his memory and his ability to walk pack up his toys drunk from Moscow cetera so after a long discussion was a police a pathologist and could we considered the fact that belly had been through many antiepileptic medications we discussed medicinal cannabis and and I said yes that let's give it a go what have we got to lose so belly started forced on CBD the was the doctor's advice he had a establish at whether belly was the CBD responder or not we tried a couple of different forms of CBD oils till we eventually find one that was looking like it was working for ballet it was micro dosed very small doses slowly over a period of time and the first I think probably the first time I actually realized that the CBD was actually working for ballet was when he was still having the same amount of seizures but the the length of the seizure was actually reducing which was amazing for me even to get him to that stage where he had a reduction in the length of his seizures was just absolutely amazing because that meant that Billy didn't need a rescue meant which was just fantastic for me because a lot of the time he suffered quite badly from the side effects of the rescue medication he then started to I noticed was some as well has eye contact getting a lot better becoming more aware of her surroundings noticing things more paying more attention to me more attention to his books his toys jigsaws etc he was it was like his brain was making connections that I had never seen before and the but the really really great part about it for me as well as Polly's mommy was that I was sayin it was almost like I was making my new song it was like Billy had loved with me and I had been his mommy for 11 years but I was starting to see a different belly it was like meeting a new song it was just an amazing feeling and every week they went past the seizures then started to reduce in quantity and he started to improve in all aspects of his physical ability and and and his mental ability to finally we got him where we couldn't go any higher on the CBD but we had got ballet to 98% seizure free which was absolutely incredible we found good evidence not quite as overwhelming but good evidence for a variety of other indications one was epilepsy and particularly children with various forms of childhood resistant epilepsy that can you can work wonders for them it can actually stop people having several tens of seizures each day so that's so remarkable effect in some people but not in everybody but more studies need to be done on that indication yeah kids were epilepsy yeah I think we probably have about three four kids that parents come in and they buy tinctures and and you know the doctor told them hey star with a low doses and they come in and buy him and they literally you see them like every week and they're like it's so much better than giving them like 10 pills a day and you know her in their stomach and you know and not only that is the price itself the other indication was for Parkinson's disease surprisingly there's been some very good individual examples of cannabis really stopping profound movements in Parkinson's disease and can be dramatically helpful for some people but the evidence that it is across the cross the spectrum is still rather lacking and again it simply means those studies haven't been done to confirm what helps what dosage what type of cannabis how often you have to take it what form you have to take it in its those studies that are lacking it clearly helps many people with Parkinson's but the evidence is still a little bit thin on the ground to sort of formally recommend it my name is Ian Frisell I have early onset Parkinson's disease I was formerly diagnosed in 2011 but I've been suffering symptoms since about 1995 the main symptom that I suffer due to Parkinson's is tremor which affects all four limbs my neck my jaw amytal sacrum tremor I have dystonia in my feet which causes my toes to curl under my foot and muscular stiffness and weakness those are all motor symptoms of the non-motor symptoms lack of motivation is the worst and most debilitating assistant symptom that I have there are many other minor symptoms such as loss of sense of smell but those are my major symptoms my life has changed quite dramatically since diagnosis I hadn't decided to retire from being a computer consultant and do little property developments keep me busy and to earn a crust I've just bought this cottage as a renovation project I've completely gutted it I don't have symptoms I didn't relate to my tremor which I've suffered with mildly for many years I liked energy was falling asleep during the day I had no motivation and all of these things turned out to be due to my Parkinson's my symptoms have become more pronounced following some dental work which led to my diagnosis repeating these days I do not work I simply don't have the energy and I'm constantly battling like a motivation it's one of the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's I came to use cannabis through researching natural tremor control on the Internet there are various foods that sits behind dopamine but I tried them and got no benefit I came across a number of accounts of people with Parkinson's using cannabis to calm tremor I was getting desperate at this stage so I asked a friend who I knew used cannabis recreationally who'd get me something to try I smoked a little and the effects were almost instant it gave me a 90 to 95 percent reduction in trauma as a bonus it also received my dystonia and helping my speech I've used it ever since yeah as soon as you vape the cannabis you do get the hit so immediately it feels like Rush and then sort of five or ten minutes later the relaxation kicks in and I just feel the tremor melt away really yes I've personally seen cannabis working the most dramatic I've seen is in the context of Parkinson's disease where people can have as a as a side effect of medication or as part of the Parkinson disease itself they're gonna have quite profound tremors and sometimes even wild movements of the arms and you can give cannabis and it can stop those movements so that's the most dramatic and short-term immediate impact so what's the science here the endocannabinoid system is the largest neurotransmitter network in our bodies the main function of the endocannabinoid system is homeostasis homeostasis is a concept that most biological systems are actively regulated to maintain conditions within a narrow range homeostasis is the regulations of the body's functions and has been compared to the concept of the Goldilocks zone deriving from the story of Goldilocks and the three bears where Goldilocks prefers the just right porridge not too hot and not too cold just the right balance of both this expression is used mainly to show a planet like Earth that is just the right distance from the Sun to sustain life a position that is just right our bodies conditions need to be just right for ourselves to maintain an optimum performance the body's endocannabinoid system is a vital system for helping to maintain homeostasis it helps the cells stay in their Goldilocks and often referred to as the modulation effect this gives us a very good insight as to how cannabis CBD and THC stop or calm epileptic or Parkinson's fits and tremors in one example under cannabinoids are created when an overactive neuron fires excessively such as in the case with epilepsy the neurons connected that are not affected will send endocannabinoids to lower the activity and bring the cell back to the Goldilocks zone in cases of severe epilepsy the endocannabinoids are too weak and too few to overcome this imbalance coupled with a fact that metabolic enzymes such as F aah and ma GL quickly break down and and amide and to AG shortening their effects CBD and THC are like a steroid shot to the endocannabinoid system having a much stronger effect than the endocannabinoids themselves CBD and THC RF aah and M AGL resistant meaning that the effects last longer and are more pronounced CBD also prolongs the effects of endocannabinoids such as an and amide this is why the flavor of foods especially those containing milk such as chocolate and cakes etc are hyper exaggerated whilst on cannabis the Ananda might breakdown is delayed by the CBD and the THC meaning its blissful effects last longer in turn the modulation effects last longer and afflictions such as fits and tremors reach a point of homeostasis quicker and are maintained for longer although cannabis is not a cure for epilepsy or Parkinson's it is an effective treatment and it is so safe it can be used by children without any known negative side effects the endocannabinoid system is often only activated where and when it is needed so when CBD is taken it goes in a sense straight to where the problem is located the cannabis oil again it was a very slow process has I contacted Billy would have never ever given you follow on eye contact in fact it's just completely avoid would have boiled G at all course he is more interested in his surroundings more interested in me looking at me and a big thing for me was he wants TM to react with me now he didn't know how I tend to react but now he was sort of beside you comment sat down in the seat beside you set up at the table beside you he will Hong Ki he wants two to two and three accuracy he he started this thing as well in Italy of common and looking student your face and staring into your face which I find hilarious I remember the first time we did it which was absolutely an amazing the most amazing thing in the world and and it made me also realize that there was a little boy in there and he was wanting to come out and he was going to come out I just had to keep doing what I was doing was I'm the medicinal cannabis because it was just making him start to express himself and it was just such an amazing feeling as a mum wait for after 11 years not having any of that and then all of a sudden he's he's he wants to do got lost my so it was an amazing positive moment I think the current legislation in regards to kind of miss Burgess on the criminal although there aren't to my knowledge any studies which prove the case from its medicinal use of cannabis for Parkinson's and health care professionals will tell you that it is unproven those same help health care professionals do know and some have admitted that it can be useful in some cases I'm one of those cases I've asked repeatedly over the last two or three years to be prescribed cannabis and if you told that unable to do so yet those same health care professionals are quite happy to prescribe powerful drugs with unpleasant known side-effects which they know do not help my symptoms that's just got to be wrong when we think about the medical benefits of cannabis we really need to understand what what they are based on and it turns out that the human body endogenous li our own body produces identical or virtually identical compounds to what you find in the cannabis plant and the neurotransmitter system that produces and regulates those compounds is called the endocannabinoid system it's present in your brain it's present in your organs is present in your skin its present in upwards of 90% of your body and wherever the endocannabinoid system is its purpose is the same which is to maintain or restore homeostasis your body's natural balance so cannabis is good for just about anything that ails you and you know in the beginning when I started talking about about cannabis we didn't even know about the endocannabinoid system people would just say all but that hippie is crazy he thinks cannabis is good for everything right well it turns out that that that cannabis is because what it does is it has this modulating effect where it restores your body's natural balance the best example of the modulating effect of cannabis that I can get comes out of an Israeli nursing home study where something like a hundred nursing home elderly nursing home patients were supplied with cannabis and all of them reported improved sleep decrease in nightmares right but the really interesting thing was that those who were overweight dropped weight and came closer to their ideal body mass index and those who were underweight gained weight and came closer to their ideal body mass index this is the modulating effect of cannabis the endocannabinoid system is the explanation for why cannabis is good for reducing cancer tumors easing epileptic seizures a quelling depression alleviating anxiety and insomnia mitigating chronic pain there's there are just an incredibly wide range of medical uses for cannabis so 20 years from now my prediction is that the rediscovery and the Renaissance of medical cannabis will be looked upon as the most important medical development since the discovery of germ theory so there has long been interest in the relationship between cannabis and cancer for many decades it was presumed or it was opined that cannabis might play a role in causing cancer cancer the lungs cancer of the upper arrow digestive tract for instance and what we've seen over time is that the data has never substantiated that fear what is known today is that the use of cannabis even long-term does not seem to be associated with the diagnosis of the sort of tobacco-related cancers that many people expected and in fact some of those studies have shown that people that use cannabis are actually less likely to be diagnosed with some of these diseases compared to people who don't use marijuana at all so that's been a very interesting finding and it's led some scientists to further look into this question of whether cannabis are again the constituents in the canvas plant might actually play a role in cancer prevention or in mitigating the spread of cancer now we have preliminary data we have cell studies we have animal models that show that cannabinoids clearly can kill cancer cells we know the mechanism of action and we have seen these results consistently again in petri dishes in animal models of course the $64 question is whether cannabis would provide those same sort of results and activity in humans with cancer and we don't know the answer to that question we know that cannabinoids can trigger apoptosis which is programmed cell death and will admit cancer cells and animals we know that it can do that in a petri dish we don't know the dosage that would be required to safely and effectively achieve those same sort of result and humans and it's unfortunate we don't know because absent the long-standing politican abyss we probably would know the answer to that question today my name's Linc oxen I've got breast cancer I was diagnosed on the 28th of June this year with a grade 3 aggressive tumor estrogen positive her2 negative with extensive lymph node involvement in under my almond in my neck I found a lump and went to see my GP and she said it was a cause for concern and referred me to the breast care unit I was lucky to get an appointment the following morning so by 10 o'clock the next day I knew that I had breast cancer because I could see it on the scan she showed it to me and I obviously said is it assist and she said no and I said so is it cancer she said yes they the tumor was big it looked enormous and there was extensive lymph node involvement under my arms and in my neck I saw the consultant on the Tuesday and he told me that the tumor was 33 millimeters but it hadn't spread anywhere else was just in my lymph nodes and he told me I would need 8 rounds of chemotherapy followed by a lumpectomy or a mastectomy and then radiotherapy so I went away and I did lots of reading and research because I just wanted to know what I could do for me because the thing with cancer is it takes away your control you're not in control anymore and I don't find that very easy so I did a lot of research and I knew about cannabis oil CBD oil because of someone that we'd helped through work and she got non-hodgkins lymphoma and chemotherapy hadn't worked it hadn't killed the cancer so that she could actually have a bone marrow transplant and they sent her home to die Claire family got her on to CBD oil and when she went back for her scam aid they weren't expecting to see her and B she was cancer-free and able to have that bone marrow transplant and everything I read and online and and I got some books as well just reinforced the fact that CBD cannabis all seemed to work and I thought I'm going to give this a go so on the 7th of July I started to take it I was seeing the consultant again on the 24th of July and he described the lump then as palpable which meant that it was soft well it hadn't been soft it felt like the corner of a table and so and from then on I couldn't actually feel this lump at all so it came to two days before I was due to start my chemotherapy and I rang the hospital and said you know I can't feel this lump anymore can I have another ultrasound scar and they said no so I rang my GP and she referred me to the local new field hospital and I had a private scan which I paid for what I didn't know was that the man who the radiologist who did the scan actually was part of the breast care team and he had my original scans he'd asked for them so he I could see in doing it I could see on the screen that there was still some tumor there and and he said well actually it's smaller so I said how much smaller and he said all in good time when he'd finished his eyes were like saucers and he said it shrunk do you mind if I do a mammogram and I said oh of course I don't so he did a mammogram and then took me in the office and showed me and the original tumor 33 millimeters was now 11 millimeters and the lymph nodes which had been 25 millimeters so they were big like grapes we're down to ten and and the mammogram where us before the tumor was like a pebble it was just hazing so the whole density of it had changed completely so obviously then I didn't really know what to do because I was due to start chemo on the Wednesday and in the end I had to go down to the hospital on the Wednesday morning and see the breast care team and say look what am i doing I don't know what to do now and so they deferred my chemotherapy and I saw the consultant the following week after they discussed me at their management team meeting and he said obviously it's amazing this is amazing but as clinicians we have to tell you that we recommend that you have chemotherapy so I said to him okay with the grade 3 aggressive tumor left 8 weeks what would you have expected to see on that scan and he said well it wouldn't have shrunk so I said okay if I'm prepared to take the risk will you monitor me and they said yes we'd be delighted to and so that's what's happened since so now I'm down to about 5 millimeters and it's not a lump as such it's it's 5 millimeters of cancer cells I could show you so much history when you know the one that just totally burns me up is cannabis and cancer right now now we know I've seen it with my own eyes and you can go talk to you know professor Guzman from the University of Madrid and a whole army of other scientists who have established that that that cancer that cannabis stops the growth of cancer tumors right so this isn't new information the National Institute on Drug Abuse knew this in 1974 they ran a study in 1974 that was designed to show the cannabis causes cancer the results came back showing the opposite cannabis actually fights cancer what did they do they buried the study not only did they bury the study they didn't refer to anybody they didn't send it to the National Cancer Institute they did nothing right three years later they did it again another study design show that cannabis causes cancer same exact results I same exact results in both categories the scientific results and what they did with it so again it goes into the dustbin right and then several years later they do a third study this time on lung cancer and they figure out lung cancer smoke smoke causes cancer we've got them this time right they hired a doctor named dr. Donald tashkin to do the taskin study tashkin examined the rates of lung cancer amongst cannabis smokers tobacco smokers and non-smokers he found the lowest rate of cancer incidents in cannabis smokers the second lowest rate in non-smokers of anything and of course the highest rate in tobacco smokers and there's a very simple reason for that despite the tar and other carcinogenic substances that are in any smoke the cannabinoids that were in the cannabis smoke were so strong they fought cancer so effectively that they completely not only completely out laid the smoke right but what pushed it in the other direction of prevention my name is Jacqueline Richie and I suffer from breast cancer I had the genetic crack one which usually gives you tumors or fatally or cancers so I had two triple negative metal plastic cancer which is a really really and on the other breast I had another cancer h2 I'm here to positive breast cancer there's some some of the cancer that I had was just a lump on my breast and then when I went to the doctor's and had a mammogram they discovered the lump on the other breast as well because I had bilateral breast cancer they realized there was a possibility I would have the genetic black gene so I was tested as well and the treatment I've had is a radical double mastectomy and chemo regime for the two different types of cancers effects are chemotherapy for me the first time I had chemotherapy were terrible I could hardly breathe I could hardly move I what's about everywhere with a plastic bag like this before I started chemotherapy I already had a couple of Muenster some problems I had renal syndrome she's bad blood circulation and fingers and toes and I already had the IPS I was chemical intolerant so I was identified by ice floes and once chemo started that was all a lot worse exasperated everything so when constant white feet constantly freezing and originally I am I used cannabis when I was younger to treat anxiety and I suffered during Alexia and I was younger as well so just it's cheating heart when I was younger so it's already a big realization about your plant being used indefinitely but I didn't realize about the cancer it wasn't I started to start to know that started realizing had done some wood quite a lot research with regards to the cannabis plan ants different types of cancer so I started doing all the research on that I actually managed to get in touch with Rick Simpson yeah I managed to get in touch with him through a Facebook page so there was a correspondence there and he just directed me weird I needed to score to go watch the movie and watch strains I would need to grow and how it needs to be growing hi to decarboxylated and to the oil that i needs and now what all the equipment I need to do he more or less hunted me all the information that I needed the day that I was diagnosed I started looking to see if I could actually get some cannabis oil and I did manage to get small amounts of cannabis oil and because I've managed to get small amounts of cannabis oil I actually put my surgery off they wanted to do surgery immediately because of the two different types of cancer so I put this surgery often told me and from February to me I used the oil whenever I could get it but it was quite sporadic so I ended up running out of oil nickimja started growing up to that point I've actually managed to do just the tumor quite a bit and the pain from the tumor had it disappeared as well I wasn't getting pain from the tumor because I couldn't procure any more oil I ended up surgery radical double mastectomy and me but from the time that I heard this surgery I already had oil certain wien for me by at that point because from more or less just after I was diagnosed I actually started brewing a couple of plan so I knew if I put things off a bit I would have my own oil ready by the time I started chemotherapy so I used smart-1 oil by the time the second chemotherapy treatment that happens it was my own oil well I had been there I had researched the stream so I had two surgery on me and chemotherapy started in the July so like I said from the second chemotherapy for all the rest of the chemotherapy all the way through I took oil I took oil and I have the pathology from my mastectomy and they're really really rare cancer that I had that was nearly a five centimeter tumor the majority of it was actually a necrotic tissue there was just a few cancer cells and on the inside of that and from the prognosis they gave me from the pathology they had my race or recurrence within the next two years that nearly a hundred percent and I'm sitting there over three years now and I haven't had a recurrence as far as I know and just before my last chemo I had an appointment with the oncologist and at that point an ecologist had said to me that they'd find a skull and a liver lesion and at that point I was certain things in myself mm-hmm chemotherapy obviously hasn't worked and I need to up my oil and tea because I need to sort this out and I said to my oncologist thing I'm just going to do one more chemotherapy and that's my chemotherapy regime finished I don't want any more I don't want any more allopathic treatment I'm going to reach treat my skull of liver lesion with diet supplements and oil and when I finished chemotherapy I still had a skull and liver lesion a month later when I went down to England after doing my diet and more oil and a person for the full month and being really really good and I went are we going to in go and seek a full-body thermographic scan and thanks to Rosa I've got results back from a team of doctors and the sets which are clear you've got no evidence of disease there's no office colon liver lesion or anything there so I use a very very happy woman a very happy woman I've been made since those on and off ever since then so yeah you and I all know well so let me strike a little closer to home Sir John Reynolds who you may know the personal physician to Queen Victoria's household not only prescribed for the Queen's menstrual cramps right but also hailed it as the most effective preventative and remedy for what we now call Alzheimer's disease for which we have excellent scientific evidence now because cannabis helps prevent the accumulation of plaque in your brain and there's good hard science on on this now so you can you can find a similar trail through medical history for literally dozens of ailments I think the most surprising thing I've learned about cannabis is the immense amount of good it does for people working as a medical journalist I began to become aware of the fact that there was more and more evidence emerging but it was only when I actually got involved in the campaign that I started to meet people who have some of the most terrible medical conditions are either diseases often neurodegenerative diseases things like Parkinson's or MS but also people who suffer from things like spinal injury or injuries or deformities or things like um stenosis or scoliosis and you see these people who have intense chronic neuropathic pain which conventional and very dangerous pain killers usually opioids barely touch and you see how their life is literally completely transformed by the use of cannabis in the United Kingdom cannabis is a Class B drug meaning that a person in possession of cannabis could face up to five years in prison and up to fourteen years in prison for supplying this makes it extremely difficult for anyone that wants to use cannabis as a treatment the United patients Alliance has been set up to campaign on behalf for legal access to medical cannabis to treat chronic conditions every year the UPA puts on events to raise awareness of medical cannabis and to keep the conversation in the public consciousness hi I'm John le bling I'm political director of United patients Alliance we are a medical cannabis organization there are around about 1 million medical cannabis patients currently in the UK consuming cannabis because they find that better for them than prescription medications and we support them we've got about 10,000 people who who we directly support and we also lobby for change so that we can get legal access to cannabis therapeutics but they hundreds of thousands of people that need it every single one of us it United patients Alliance is a medical cannabis patient every single one of us and so I'm someone who's suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my life and I've managed that adequately with cannabis I mean some years ago unfortunately I got into the wrong side of the law for growing my own medicine and that's kind of how I got involved and United patients Alliance formed a couple of years ago in 2014 and we're all patients so I found a clock French he's a multiple sclerosis sufferer he was diagnosed when he was 24 and when he came across cannabis he could reduce the amount of opiate medications he was on the tramadol and and and he was able to replace that with cannabis and he was able to start working today he was actually more mote mile and in fact he got so well he helped create United patients Alliance and so we're here at raising awareness the United patients Alliance started is just a small group of patients who use cannabis as a medicine and we wanted to change the law around that because we were fed being persecuted and made to feel like criminals for our choice medicine what we actually did when we started tryna lobby and change law by accident we grew up this really lovely community of people who are already using cannabis as a medicine in the UK so now what we have is a really good online community where patients who are just starting out and they kind of this charity journey they can come and learn from other patients about what strains work best for certain things oil making methods and all the sort of things that go along with that it's a really good reliable source of information because it's patients learning from other patients and we're creating a best practice within our community so that when the law changes we will have the knowledge they're ready to enact and help as many people as we can [Music] [Music] [Music] quote about five minutes ago it's just that it has passed absolutely all the eyes have it you would use this Robbie our politicians you must speak to your MP today get your phone out email them now let your elected representative know that you came here today in support of mission and that you believe that cannabis needs to be regulated doesn't matter who you work for it doesn't matter or family want a raise what matters is that we're all on the same page for cannabis as medicine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my name's Kelly Blackwell and my son is Darren Blackwell and in 2010 he was diagnosed with leukemia two years later he had a second cancer called Langerhans cell sarcoma subsequently he had four bone-marrow transplants in ten months to try and prevent either cancer coming back and unfortunately on his fourth and final chance grin he developed three catastrophic infections he had no functioning bone marrow and they told us of nobody'd ever engrafted after 50 days so we got to say 46 there was nothing there at all so we were sent to hospice and my son was given approximately three days to a week to live Darrin start to get very anxious because seriously facing his death planned his funeral plans everything about it and I decided to start administering there a teacher that we made out of cannabis mainly to alleviate his anxiety that he was suffering from and they were also trying to give him a lot of morphine and he made it very clear that he didn't want to die on morphine he wanted to be compos mentis so we started giving a cannabis tincture and five days later and he's Bo Murray kicked in at least 75 and he officially engrafted it's a 104 they called him a miracle because they had never seen it before he was on no other medications other than what I was giving you which I have to keep secret because back then then I was scared of social services and losing my children and now losing the one thing that you know what's helping Darrin I had this published in April of this year and it's a full complete story of the whole journey it's not just about cannabis so cannabis is no tiny 25 and I wrote it hopefully because I want to give people hope I want to give people the chance to understand that there are other other opportunities there you know there are other options we don't have to just go with what they tell us there are other ways you know Darrin is proof of that living proof of us as our hundreds of people here today [Music] the bill is to reverse an error in a previous bill that said that cannabis has no medical value the legislation on cannabis at the moment is an ass it's actually states that cannabis has no medicinal value and this is contrary the experience of 5000 years of the use of cannabis in all the civilizations in the world but if we get through that and decide it has some release menus then throwing from that is the possibility of the sale of various products that are already available but the world's tide is turning against prohibition and we've already seen the majority of states in America 29 of them have a legalized medicinal cannabis Canada is leading the way Uruguay a whole range of countries throughout the world are realizing that we need a new policy the UK has one of the toughest drug policies across the Western world and we differ in particular from the USA and many countries in Europe as we know the majority now of US states now legal have legalized cannabis for medical use many have also legalized it for social use but we're not discussing that here a dozen countries in Europe now have legalized one way or another the use of cannabis for medical purposes it's interesting that Denmark passed their law actually in November last year legalizing medical cannabis Germany passed their law through their lower house in January this year we have Ireland with their law going through Parliament as we speak so the the move towards recognizing the incredible medical value of cannabis is I would say becoming more and more rapid across the world but the UK no change no change at all so we're really getting left behind here in a way the Lib Dems took a risk we went out and advocated for reform and we sought to appeal to all those reform-minded voters who absolutely see the nonsense in the current position we didn't get that case heard well enough in the general election but in time other political parties I think we'll see that public opinion has changed and that increasingly the public think the existing also a ludicrous as they are well the most important thing about it about regulating cannabis would be to restrict access to church to children and I mean I'm a great admirer and I would completely endorse the strategy that you Justin Trudeau's adopted in Canada where we're almost as in the same in the same sentence the same we're going to legalize cannabis he says we're going to restrict access to it and I think that is the way forward now many people would argue that you don't need to restrict access to cannabis and should be treated like cauliflower or carrots or tomatoes and I was to have some sort of emotional sympathy with that I think you think you're being pragmatic about this in the real world that's not a sensible attitude and there's no doubt that if cannabis does cause harm and you know look again let's be honest cannabis can cause harm only in a very small number of cases but cannabis can cause harm it's the psychoactive substance just to suggest it can't will be foolish so if it can cause harm then children are most vulnerable and I'm keen to give this place laws that make sense at the moment most laws are prejudice which and evidence free and the cannabis laws are irrational unscientific and to a great deal of damage they actually increased create crime they increase abuse of drugs and they waste a fortune but to be the cruelest aspect of always a prohibition all that seriously ill people are denied their medicine of choice and there's an abundance of evidence that cannabis has a unique role to play particularly in relieving the symptoms of a very cruel disease multiple sclerosis we had a report on the medical benefits of cannabis undertaken by Professor Barnes for our inquiry and really we rely very much on his report of worldwide research to talk about that is the issue of the specific medical conditions for which cannabis is most helpful and what he found is that there is good evidence for medical cannabis for conditions like chronic and in particular neuropathic pain in dealing with seizures for example in the case of people with multiple sclerosis for epilepsy in young children for example and certainly for the symptoms of nausea sleeplessness and so on that arise as a result of people with cancer taking chemotherapy so there are there are those conditions anyway for which the evidence according to Professor Barnes is good there are a number of other conditions where there is some evidence that cannabis can be helpful it's truly remarkable actually the extent to which cannabis can help people with very very different kinds of conditions yes I've been involved with endow pain since the early days but basically that campaign is designed to make cannabis legal for medical use without getting too technical at the moment it's a Schedule one drug and the misuse of drugs act that means that it has no medicinal value which is complete nonsense there's overwhelming evidence that it does have medicinal value many countries around the world over half for the American states have now recognized his use and made it legal so for the government to maintain that it's a Schedule one drug of no medicinal value is it's nonsense it's just the inertia in this country and the prediction clearly in that article was wholly misplaced but I think in a way the difference between the United States and the United Kingdom is that they're much more devolved a style of government where states have considerable control over policymaking in a whole range of areas facilitates experimentation and innovation in lawmaking and so you've had a few states going out ahead I mean California went out ahead on medical use of cannabis some years ago now and have now voted for legalization of recreational use Colorado has had recreational use legalized for two or three years now and as people see that it's worked it hasn't led to a collapse of morality or law nor breaking or anything of that sort then it convinces other states that they can try it but in this country it's all-or-nothing you have to convince the national government to do it and that's much more difficult in the u.s. cannabis is legal in nine states for medical and recreational use 30 states and all have passed laws allowing some degree of medical use of marijuana California has a long history of fighting for legalization since the 1960s and gained huge ground in the early 90s with proposition 215 proposition 215 was conceived by San Francisco marijuana activist Dennis Peron in memory of his partner Jonathan West who had used medical marijuana to treat the symptoms of AIDS in 1991 Peron organized proposition P the San Francisco Medical Marijuana initiative which passed with 79 percent of the vote proposition P did not have the force of law but was simply a resolution declaring the city support for medical marijuana proposition 215 was enacted into law on November 5th 1996 by means of the initiative process and passed with fifty five point six percent of the vote in favor since that time the medical cannabis industry in California has said as ups and downs but is now a thriving industry adding billions to the state's economy with the passing of Proposition 64 in November 2016 legalizing the sale of recreational cannabis for adults estimates based on their current illegal market could mean that California could see a rise in over 5.7 billion dollars in revenue from the legalization of recreational cannabis the ArcView group issues a report every year on the International cannabis market and we know that in the United States cannabis legal cannabis is the fastest growing industry in the entire country my name is Joshua I'm a manager here at Coachella collective we are a medical dispensary in California and we are here to provide great medicine for patients I'm a budtender or you could because I've been considered the manager here it's like a bartender mixed that with somebody Nick when I first started doing this actually I remember walking up to my mom when I was 18 and telling her hey mom look I'm a doctor you know I was like I'm a pharmacist now I was like I prescribed medicine to people all day long in ii see definitely as a medication the way i look at it is herbal medicines you know there's people that do straight herbal medicines that are considered you know voodoo doctors witchcraft talks or whatever they want to be called and all this other alternative medicine like you know but they're still considered technically a doctor because it's the herbal medicine it's the same thing cannabis is just an herbal medicine so I definitely feel and relate that idea of us being doctors that's being pharmacists because that's what we do we treat people i it's like a bartender you know they say they have a what is it bachelors in psychiatry right that's how I feel sometimes when I'm here you know my patients come in bad day good day they come in and talk to me they tell me their problem they tell me they're stressing about and I recommend weed that I feel would be best for them you know sometimes people are having really bad days and they don't they they don't feel like talking as much so they want something to mellow them out other times some people are feeling really bad or upset that they just want to have something to make them have an uplifting feel so you get something more of like a citrus or something that has a more upbringing feel to it originally when it first came out when it was medically walk into a doctor's office and you'd go into the office and you first talk to one the receptionist would probably be a very attractive woman depending on how it is because you know in California there's a lot of backward doctors that you know just give out wrecks like nothing you know like oh you you're sleepy you get some cannabis but then there are doctors actually ask you more you know thorough questions actually ask you you know what are you paying and your insomnia is nothing has to see if cannabis is best for you and so it really just depends on where that person goes to get their doctor recommendation which is really determined on the process the change in culture you can see it's a lot less black market a lot more open see a lot more cost obviously just being more compliant with it you know just just more in the sense of kind of just being accepting of it it's it's a whole culture of like you see even the older generation I used to call all of us drug users and drug abusers you even seeing them start seeing and hearing about it and you know it's very big with the Hispanic culture that like that's something that would be that would be looked down upon and be frowned upon heard also test was just like obviously this is about the naturalness of it like weed is very natural but it's also if you you know you feel sick sometimes you feel crappy and sluggish you need to eat better you know you need to put better things in your body you know weed is a better alternative to any kind of medicine you can be taking cuz pill forms all this other stuff that they add and all these you know Jill's and powders and stuff that that breakdown in your body like what's all that extra you know compared to just burning of a leaf my name is Kendrick Mejia aka poly Rob and I am a producer and engineer and co-owner of local astronauts local astronauts is a it's a company which consists of a collective of creatives that's coming together for you know a culture rebranding music production video production and we really were really about advancing the culture as we see it and where we want to see it within the next you know a couple of years at 34 years old you know being I consider the business prime of my time you know before I never used to smoke weed at all during my 20s early 20s mid 20s I never used to smoke weed in my brain it was always a point of trying to just stay abrupt and and be just the first person moving and I felt that weed was the exact opposite of what I was trying to accomplish you know all of my friends they smoke weed which all due respect is great not a problem it was just for me I didn't want to feel sluggish I didn't want to feel like I was the person that would just forget things or you know just kind of a cliche ideas of what you thought marijuana you know would do to you and this is only just my natural ignorance of not knowing about marijuana so you know fast forward you know to about a couple of years ago you know I'm getting off the plane after 18 hours of you know doing a session in Ohio I get off the plane and I come back to my studio in Los Angeles another set of clients calls me about three in the morning which is this is like my peak hours to either keep working or finish the day off like completely finish today so they called me they say hey man we're you know we're in town we got off the plane early we're in town so they pull up to my studio and you know we proceeded to play music you know talk a little bit about business or whatnot and we just were enjoying each other's company of course it's all about five six in the morning so when they leave they say okay we're going back to the hotel we're gonna you know settled a get some sleep wake up and let's continue to discuss whatever it is we need to do so fine so they've gone I proceeded to lay down because now I'm in the studio I'm not gonna travel home I was just not traveling alone so I sleep in the studio and I lay on my couch and when I wake up however my face was laid on the couch it stayed like that completely like it was my entire face was just was the shut-in just to one facial expression and my and it was drooping my face was very droopy so I'm no I'm trying to wash my face with water trying to figure this thing out and it just go so had to postpone the meeting you know went to the doctor and a doctor told me I had Bell's palsy and Bell's palsy is pretty much in a nutshell it's when your when your your brain nerves don't react to your face you your face you know nervous so you know it's terrible and it comes from lack of sleep you know in a stress stress that you know you don't know you have you know you can be working 1820 hours if you don't allow your body to relax and tranquilize you know you can you know easily you know put your body into almost like a semi you know semi stroke I had to take pills I took pills for about four days a muscle relaxants I just wasn't into it wasn't into it at all so one of my colleagues suggested that I smoke marijuana you know the accident they said have you ever tried smoking where marijuana so you know relax your nerves I'm like no I don't smoke and they're like you should definitely try it like this is this is something that can eventually turn into a major stroke if you don't treat it properly I thought about it for a minute then you know other options of cannabis lotions taking edibles some things like that so I started to smoke you know smoke marijuana and like literally immediately after my face would just it would twitch a little bit and then it would formulate itself for me to be able to speak a lot better and like even now but you can still see bits of my face that are are still working itself out and it really it works some wonder it really puts my face back in and so normal along with of course proper eating and you know facial exercises it allows me to kind of get everything back into motion and I just had a newfound respect for what marijuana does I you know I have a totally totally newfound respect and then you know after a lot more homework you know social media is just open so after doing a lot more homework I started to figure out that it's just so many health benefits for cannabis you know and I'm definitely appreciative of being able to have the opportunity to even get myself back to normal you know the average person if they're not on medication and they have a Bell's palsy or cerebral palsy or mini-strokes or you know different you know different diseases or symptoms like you know some of them are so far gone they don't have the ability to get back as it's like their body is at that point where it's just it's a breaking point so I was just I was lucky to be able to have the privilege of even have an opportunity to get back and you know and it's changed the whole way I kind of look at how I enjoy and endure life as well you know I mean so it's it's a beautiful thing for me now [Music] so I was inspired to to open Harborside by the lack of a really responsible professional dispensary when I came to California there were dispensaries that had been started by activists which were very amateurish and there were dispensaries that were started by people who really just wanted to make as much money as they could as quickly as they could and they were ugly and scary so I wanted to create a gold standard for cannabis retailing to show that when this activity is done with intelligence and integrity that it can bring benefits to communities instead of harms the whole idea of Harborside from the beginning was to create a truly responsible professional cannabis retail environment someplace that was really worthy of the plant and so we set out from from the beginning to sort of create a temple to cannabis Harborside started as a family business as we've grown it's become bigger than than my family could manage and we are now you know growing into a real company a real corporation but we always work hard to maintain the same sense of caring about each other and for each other that that you would see in a family that we've always had here at Harbor side we we don't want to just create a new business or even a new industry we want to create a new kind of business a new kind of industry that smashes the old models and is really like committed to building the kind of world we all want to live in a world that's that has sustainable practices in it a world that reflects the diversity of human beings a world that's fair to everybody and takes care of everybody and so we try to do that here and model that world we want to live in the four-year experiment in Colorado cannabis was first to criminalized in Colorado in 1975 that was still illegal it was not a criminal offense meaning that you could not go to prison for possession only a civil fine could be imposed in 2000 the 23rd man went to the States Constitution may cannabis legal for medical purposes anyone with a doctor's prescription could now access cannabis as a medicine in 2014 Colorado legalized recreational cannabis in the 64th Amendment to its constitution since that time adults over 21 can legally smoke or ingest cannabis on private premises also people can grow up to six plants and travel in state with up to one ounce the Colorado Department of Revenue showed that recreational and medical cannabis sales reached 1.3 billion in 2016 8 out of the 12 months in that year reached over a hundred million and revenue which yielded nearly 200 million in tax 2017 soar rise to around 1.8 billion in revenue [Music] as the rest of the United States is seeing a rise in crime Colorado is seeing a decrease in serious crimes such as homicide and robbery since legalization cannabis use in 12 to 17 year olds has decreased significantly but adult use especially those over 50 have skyrocketed drug-related deaths have decreased due to the decline in opioid use and other hard drugs in 2017 three years after legalizing cannabis Colorado had the lowest unemployment rate in the country at 2.3 percent the lowest since 2001 in 2015 alone the state's cannabis industry created 18,000 new full-time jobs cannabis turns out to be a stronger economic driver than 90% of the industry's active in Colorado my name is Pepe Breton and I'm the owner CEO you flora which is a chain of retail stores in Denver Colorado at the beginning you know I was in corporate America and I was kind of tired and I always want to do my own business and at the time I was searching for you know what I can do business-wise that I can be my own boss and at the time this whole medical marijuana movement was going like crazy and I said hey like you know if you know drug dealers can do it and are not so smart and like I'm sure I can figure out how to do it so at the time I partner up with a friend of mine back route tomatoes and the one thing I knew is that if you can grow tomatoes so you can grow anything so I partner up with my friend and I was like they're like you know how to grow tomatoes with scigirl marijuana for medicinal purposes and yeah it just kind of started from there I took a $30,000 investment to we are now really recreational was what took marijuana to the next level because back then it was just about a hundred thousand patients and you have you know hundreds of dispensaries and once it became recreational now you're talking you know millions of people millions of tourists so now it really has become a legitimate industry that you know creates millions of dollars of tax revenue and you know hundreds of thousands of jobs now and really has helped Colorado economy tremendously you know I think the best statistic that I've heard is as far as crime coming down they used to say that April was the highest month as far as crime rate goes and now with you know 4/20 being April 20th they said this last year was like you know the least crime and the month of April definitely yes like marijuana has taken some share from you know drinking so maybe the people that were drinking then now they're smoking and you know typically when you're gonna be smoking you just want to sit on your house and relax you never see anybody you know trying to get violent or crazy or you know ballsy they're just you know cool chill people I want to relax happy so that's that you know that's a huge positive when you think about marijuana versus alcohol so yeah definitely marijuana has definitely changed I'll say maybe not the world now but definitely has changed Colorado like there's no way that without marijuana at Colorado will be where it is which you know we're one of the top states as far as growth and real estate and I mean we see thousands of people moving every month from different states and probably have about a hundred employees that are those 100 employees like 70% of them they come from different states and they come because it's in this range the United Nations meeting last April the United Nations General Assembly special session on drugs turned global drug policy on its head and that was an incredibly important meeting what the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime representative said was that evidence-based public health policy on drugs is here to stay the relevance of this to medical cannabis is that in our view there is now adequate evidence to show that patients should have access to cannabis for medical purposes the UN are saying let's have evidence-based policy in my view they are therefore saying let's have legalization of cannabis for medical use they haven't actually said that but the implications of what they said about evidence are very clear to me and I feel the UK should therefore act we need to regulate all drugs not in the interest of the pharmaceutical countries mainly the interest of the those who are vulnerable we're taking them and certainly if when cannabis is on sale here there ought to be regulations to prevent their issues by children by pregnant women by people with mental health problems we what we need is cannabis that can be used without being mixed with that hideous toxic killer drug tobacco which is acerra be responsible for so much harm in the world and we can do that with a legal market it can be used as a food as a drink as a vapor and it doesn't need to give you our hide having medicinal effect nobody you know that's the way the progress will be made at the moment scientific research is inhibited by a law that restricts research and restricts its use in experimental ways this whole subject area is packed full of hypocrisy fact that probably a lot of government ministers smoke cannabis at a younger age and yet are happy to condemn their fellow citizens to a criminal record and the consequence of lighting those people's careers the fact that many of those ministers will drink significant quantities of alcohol which we know in terms of an objective assessment of harm is significantly more harmful than cannabis and indeed many of them will smoke as well so there's hypocrisy everywhere to be seen and my plea is for us to base our policymaking and our lawmaking on evidence not on fear and anxiety and Prejudice I said to my MP a bureau so ago I have constant sort of lobbying situation they might say to him why can you not just place the responsibility in the hands of doctors you know doctors we trust doctors they're trained they're professionals you know will you rely on them at all aspects of our health why can you not just give it to doctors and say you can decide whether or not to prescribe cannabis and he said to me you put the trouble is we did that they prescribed it which it which is almost like something it's almost like a Yes Minister script you know it's just ridiculous but that's the sort of bigotry and an exam in transits so that we're up against I strongly think we should decriminalize cameras use there's a lot of people who would benefit from it if you think of all the thousands of people in this country with chronic pain from various causes all those people with muscles spasm from endless causes of stroke and brain injury multiple sclerosis let alone those who anxiety or epilepsy or nausea after chemotherapy the numbers have tens of thousands of people tens of thousands who could benefit from cannabis at the moment we're forcing them into the criminal market we're making them criminals there are one or two compounds that you can legally prescribed but they're of rather limited value in terms of their usefulness for certain specific conditions but generally speaking those who use cannabis for medical reasons are criminals because they have to buy it illegally and I think that is appalling it's really as time we change that and we're behind now the rest of the world in terms of the number of countries who are looking at or have already legalized cannabis for a whole variety of medical conditions it's time the UK government caught up with world opinion and world evidence and may and decriminalize cannabis for medical use I think it's hypocritical to oppose the use of cannabis even for recreational use but particularly for medicinal use well happily allowing the populace to kill themselves with tobacco and alcohol and whilst in the case of politicians enjoying taxpayer subsidized alcoholic beverages in the House of Commons bar and pocketing profits from their association with pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical companies who opposed legalization because a this plot is more effective from the drugs that they produce and supply to the Health Service exorbitant prices and be because they can't patent to plan I mean the world is twisted the crazy roller coaster journey that that belly has taken me on over the last number of years has flagged up a really important issue that has happened was a lower country was in Ireland and was from the United Kingdom for me as well and was some seventeen hawlings Mme and Niemann the CBD oil after belly Billy's blood we are entered into a project where we want to open research facilities here in in Ireland and throughout the UK first and foremost obviously the legislation has to change it has to medical cannabis has to be legalized for medicinal purposes only research facilities have to be allowed to go and do this we have to be allowed to demonstrate what temperature or what what what strain of the medicine is appropriate for what condition was being allowed to do all that within the UK and Ireland we should be able to move on then and pump money and the the the economy pump money money into your horse but he's aunty education and create more jobs it really as a must but for me in in in my opinion belly is knowing been on medicinal cannabis for just over a year for me a deal is done it's already legal so I I'm really not I don't say you didn't be it III don't see the discussions my world and what my my message to the politicians and to the doctors in our country look let's just get on with the job let's get this done belly is the proof in the pudding medicinal cannabis has given me back my right it's a mummy to hope but the most important thing in the midst of all of this is medicinal cannabis has given bully back his right to life my experience tells me I mean at the end of the day I'm 69 I've got 10 grandchildren I've never taken drugs but my experience tells me that this works medicinally I believe that the politicians should take notice of that I'm not on my own you know there are lots and lots of people if you look on the internet who've had the same experience and I know that's only anecdotal but what we all what we need is we need everybody to get together and so that they've got lots of us telling them that this is worked for me and they need to change things they need to legalize it for medicinal purposes it's a plan that's a plan it's I just think it's ridiculous it is a plan whoever decided that plan should be illegal they should be shot and I think our government are being highly hypocritical because GW Pharmaceuticals well if he are a government for growing in this country don't name and I've heard it's about two hundred ton few hundred plus ton of medical cannabis that they actually grow it down in England but not one part of its left and written for any patients it's all shipped other countries in the world for medicinal purposes that's what makes it so highly but we need to wonder how many other market shares and GW Pharmaceuticals so one of the questions I'm always asked is why is this criminalization policy this failed public policy why does it continue to be perpetuated why does it continue to exist in America and and quite frankly around the globe and while I can't speak directly to the motivations of those that are advocating for the continued criminalization of cannabis you'd have to ask those people yourself what their motivations are my suspicion having done this work for so many years is that the criminalization and stigmatization of cannabis and the users of cannabis it's not so much about the plant itself it's an outgrowth of a broader and ongoing culture war where you have one segment of the population typically that a segment that is in political power targeting another segment of this population again typically those that are poor those that are ethnic minorities those that lack political power and it's always been about one segment of our population targeting the other and attributing certain cultural beliefs that they have negative beliefs and negative stereotypes and applying them to these other segments of society and using cannabis as a way to be able to exert political and legal pressure upon those segments of society it's not about cannabis per se it's about the stereotypes that revolve around those who certain segments of society believe use cannabis and that's really what this is about today and that's what it has always been about I can well understand that some police forces decide that there's a better use of their time in chasing serious criminals rather than in arresting people who are using cannabis my hope is that all police forces would decide that if they find someone using cannabis for a medical purpose that they would simply turn away and the more we can do to persuade police forces of that approach the better for these poor patients who are suffering so much and for ridiculous political reasons cannot get hold of medical medical cannabis to help them do we have five objectives I'm not sure if I can remember them all off facts but the first one is to end the prohibition of cannabis as simple as that the second one is to promote as a matter of urgency in compassion the prescription of medicinal cannabis by doctors the third one is to introduce a system of regulation and supply for adults about cannabis to remove the market filter from the control of criminals the fourth one is to educate about the the benefits of cannabis and present and the fifth one is to encourage the production of industrial hemp so so really you know we're interested in ending the prohibition of cannabis in total but it's undoubtedly the case of the most urgent necessities to deal with the medical issue when you look at the neuroprotection qualities of cannabis and actually when you look at mental health around the world two of the most popular reasons for people to consume cannabis is anxiety and depression and we're not talking about clinical anxiety rushon we're talking about that which gets you down every day the kind of thing that you'll have a beer in the evening because you want to calm down before you get a bit you got your mind spinning and all that it's it that's vogue doubt that it's therapeutic and in some ways it is medicinal to everybody whether they happen to be using it recreationally whether that's what they call it or whether they actually have a medical condition that they're treating with it so we take the view that all cannabis use has therapeutic value as long as it's being used in a safe responsible way and as long as you know what it is that you're using how you're using it what the risks are and that's kind of where we're coming from I mean what we're fighting for is to gain access legal access for our patients I mean I put my personal belief is that a medical reason to access this medicine is of primary concern and that's why we're fighting for it specifically this this cannabis movement it's a global movement every living creature on the planet has an endocannabinoid system except insects so every human being on planet Earth has an endocannabinoid system every human being can benefit hugely from this medicine we have a natural right to this medicine right mother nature made us to use it our bodies produce it themselves so it is a global movement and and we're just beginning to to get the laws in the shape that we want them to be in the United States there's there's a whole world of reform waiting and so my message to to people of good conscience anywhere is there's a time to deal with this issue is now [Music] well the amazing things happened I'm actually in remission so here I am no treatment of any thought no chemo no op no radio therapy just CBD oil and and I'm in complete remission lymph nodes are all back to normal I feel great I'm the only person I know we wasn't had a cold I'm convinced that that's the oil that just balances my body and makes me feel well
