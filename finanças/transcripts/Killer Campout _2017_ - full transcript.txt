So wait, so you're telling me this guy dresses like a girl but calls himself Boy George? That's right. Why the hell would anybody do that? I don't know. It's a rebellion thing. Rebellion, my ass. Sounds like a bunch of queer bait shit if you ask me. No, all the singers are doing it now, David Bowie, Motley Crue, Alice Cooper. Alice Cooper? You're tellin' me Alice Cooper is a guy? Yeah. Shit, I liked her. Sheriff Parks, I just wanted to give you a heads up, that we've got a couple missing persons reports in. Jesus Christ, that makes five this month. What the hell's goin' on out here? Did you want to bring a few more units out here? Nah, we already got three of us. If we bring anybody else out, we ain't gonna have anybody left to patrol town. Copy that. It's probably just Mrs. Wilkerson and her goddamn cats again. Go ahead, punk. Make my day. What? Are you talkin' to me? Well, I think you're talkin' to me. How about you, bluebird? You talkin' to me? Are you sure you don't want anymore men out here? 'Cause the more men we got out here, the faster it'd be to find these assholes 'cause this forest is pretty dense. It's easy for people get lost out here. There ain't nobody gettin' lost in these woods. Samson Del Marr. I don't recall requesting your services. That's the problem with this town, Sheriff. Nobody wants to admit when the answer's right in front of their eyes. Yeah, and what answer's that, Rambo? Someone or something has been killing people in these woods. It's been happening for years, and I'm just the guy to stop it. Goddammit, Samson, look, if all these people been gettin' killed, how come we ain't never found a single drop of blood, not one dead body, not a fuckin' shred of evidence. I can't answer that, but I will. And believe me, when I do, you'll be the first to know about it. Look, we got professionals comin' down here on the job. Last thing we need is some mutton-chop, hot shit vigilante - I'm no vigilante. - Coming down and... I just wanna make sure that justice is served. Regardless, we do not need you down here causing chaos while we're trying to work. No law that says I can't go into the woods, right? That is until you realize what's really going on here, and you have to blockade that whole area off for the safety of the public. You know what? You're right. There's no law sayin' you can't go into the woods, but I might just need to see a permit for that weapon you're carrying. You know, your rules are really starting to annoy me. You have a real nice day, Sheriff. Well he seems a bit intense. I swear to God, if he goes to the press, he's gonna cost us every last bit of tourism we still got in this town. I swear to God, if he fucks this up for us, I will have no problems sending him to jail. I wouldn't worry about that. Samson couldn't find his ass if there was a bell attached to it. Let's go. It is an absolutely gorgeous day. It is. Of course, it's not as gorgeous as you, foxy. Stop, you. What? C'mon, I'm basically a modern day Casanova. I'm Tom Selleck from Magnum P.I. Totally. Hey, wait a second, Linda. Look over there. Oh, my gosh, is that what I think it is? It sure is. That's amazing. I'm sorry, Jeff, we should probably head back. My mom doesn't have anyone to take care of her, and I don't wanna miss the Morton Downey Jr. Show. Yeah, we will, I promise. But, ah, well, there's somethin' I gotta talk to you about first. Okay, what is it? Well, you know how we've been together for almost a year now, right? Yeah. And, ah, well, I guess what I'm trying to say is Linda, I can't imagine my life without you. You are everything I've ever wanted in someone. You are the first person I think about when I wake up in the morning, and the last person I think about when I go to bed at night. Oh, Jeff. I guess, ah, I guess what I want you to know is that... Linda, I could die a happy man if you would just take me as your husband. Oh. Will you marry me? Oh, Jeff, of course I'll marry you. You realize my mom will have to move in with us. She can't be alone after her stroke. Oh, I'm well aware. And trust me, we'll be perfectly fine. With me startin' my own business and buying that arcade, we'll be making more than enough money to take care of the three of us. You know, video games are getting insanely popular. It'll be in our family forever. Plus, one day, when we're ready to have kids, they'll be able to take over the business when I'm ready to retire. It can't lose, Linda. It's a sound investment. Oh, thank god for President Reagan, so we live in a country where a small businessman can make a future for his family. Oh, Jeff, you make me so happy. Oh, this is the best day of my life. Nothing could ever ruin it. No! Hey, wait, do you think Samson might be onto somethin' with this whole killer in the woods rap? Look, Samson has seen one too many shitty horror movies. Ain't nothin' in these woods but a couple of dumb asses can't find their way home. Yeah, but that's still a lot of bodies, though. Oh, don't tell me he got to you too? Alright, look, where's all the bodies at? I know, I know, you're right. - You're right. - You're goddamn right, I'm goddamn right. We'll find them. Greg, where are we going? Angelica's cabin should be around here somewhere. I know that, but where are we going? You seem totally lost. These are the directions she gave me. I don't think you're following them very well. I'm following them fine. We're gonna find the cabin, you just need to be patient. So, how are you going to explain me? Explain you? To who? - Angie? - Yeah. What's there to explain? You're supposed to be going on this trip, you're just getting a little bit late with me. That's the thing. Don't you think Angelica will suspect? Suspect what, that we're banging? Duh. Trust me, I know Angie. I know some stuff about her, too. It'll be fine. Besides, um, maybe later when we find the cabin, the three of us can have a little fun together. You're disgusting. Yeah, I know. So, um, Laura, do you, ah, do you like horror movies? Yeah, I like the really gory stuff. Really? Me too. Have you seen The Hatchet Murders? Yeah, yeah, that was directed by Dario Argento, and he did, um, Demons, too. Didn't he do, um, Suspiria? Yeah, yeah, that's the one where the girl gets her head caved in - by all that glass? - Yeah. Oh, my God, that is so awesome. Yes. Yo, I think that horror movies are for retards. I mean, they're so boring, they're so fake. I can't believe people actually watch that shit. Well, I'm glad you have an opinion, but I'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself. Yeah, whatever. Hey, man, can I get a cigarette? Dude, no, I only have a few to get me through the weekend. I can't give any out. So if you're gonna pitch a fit about it, just do it somewhere else. ♪ Just give me the answer ♪ Make your mind ♪ And I'm losing focus ♪ 'Cause my heart is in place That guy's really startin' to piss me off. He makes me feel uncomfortable. Well, don't worry. He's not gonna hurt you while I'm around. ♪ Just love me or leave me Fucking longhaired faggot. - Somethin' wrong? - I need a cigarette. Maybe you should have brought some with you. Maybe you need to shut the fuck up. Look, I didn't have the money for it. Oh, so sorry for your loss. Hey, ah, Katrina, what are you doing tonight? Wanna come to my tent? Chad, leave me alone, please. Oh, what, I'm not good enough for you? Chad, please go away. Okay, what if I don't feel like it? You're a fucking creep. Bitch, shut the fuck up. Was I talking to you? Why don't you go away? You're creepin' everybody out. You want me to give you my attention? Isn't that how you got so fucked up in the first place? Getting into other people's business? You wanna see what this gets you? Alright, alright, alright. Girls, can you go let everybody know that dinner is just about ready? Chad, I'm not gonna keep doing this. We're here to solve problems, not create more of them. You've gotta stop terrorizing the girls. Besides, big strong men like you, you don't have to be fooling around with those girls. What the hell? This is the cabin? Yeah, it's not exactly what I was expecting. It's a shit hole. There's nobody here. We couldn't have been early. I don't know. Maybe we should look around, see if anybody's home. Try and find out where the hell we are. Look around? No way. I want to go back now. This place is giving me the creeps. Fine, stay here. I'll go look around. I don't know where the hell you think you're goin', young lady, but you don't wanna be here. Who, who are you? My name's Bob, but that don't matter none. He don't mind me as long as I don't mind him. But he'll mind the two of you. You're both doomed. Look, mister, calm down, alright? Just lost in these woods, we're looking for someone. You ain't gonna find nobody out here but him. And trust me, you don't wanna meet him. Okay, we're leaving. This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake. You're both doomed, I tell you. Doomed. Get on out. Don't let me catch ya again now, ya hear? Get out while you still can. While there's still time. He's in the shadows. He's gonna be real mad that I sent you on your way. Get out. Where is Todd? I don't know, he said he's not feeling well, so he's probably in his tent sleeping. Are you sure you don't wanna any, Laura? That's okay, I'll get some in a bit. Okay. What kind of meat is this? Some kind of pulled pork? Mm, you can pull my pork, baby. Shut up, asshole. No, this is secret family recipe. You won't find anything like this in a restaurant. I bet, this is delicious. Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it. Now after we finish, I want us all to do a little group therapy session. Group therapy? You know, we'll just sit around, talk about our problems and what they are. Help to get through them. What if, what if somebody doesn't wanna talk? Oh, it'll be alright. Now, everybody eat up. It's better to talk on a full stomach. So what did Sheriff Parks say? The usual. Police are gonna be no help. Did you expect it to go any other way? Well then I guess it's just us. It's up to me, Candy. This is my war. You trained me, I'm with you. This is my war. Christ, Candy, this isn't gonna be some all American ass party. The shit's about to get super real here. You know I am one mean bitch that nobody is gonna wanna fuck with. Well, of that I'm certain. Alright, gear up. It's hunting season. Alright, kids. Like I said before, what I want us to do now is start a group therapy session. If nothing more than for me to get to know you folks. I know it'll be hard for you to talk about what you experienced, but I promise you all that you'll come out as happier people for it. Now I want you to show your fellow campers the respect of listening to what they have to say about themselves and not judging them. There's no room for judgment in this circle. Why did I make them leave? Stupid, stupid, stupid. I didn't do anything. I leave you alone. I don't talk to anybody. I keep to myself. Please, I've been good to you. Let me live. Please, let me live. I think we're lost. I followed the directions she gave me. They should have led us right to the cabin. I just, I just wanna go back. I didn't even wanna come on this trip anyway. Fine, we'll go back. Hopefully we can find the car. Ah, maybe we can find a pay phone, we can call her, I guess. Are you okay? Yeah. It's just that guy. He really freaked me out. Yeah, I would have been a little shaken up after running into Jethro from Deliverance, too. You know what would really help me calm down? I'm beginning to get the idea. Hi, my name is Todd. Hi, Todd. Ah, I guess my problem is that, ah, people say I act out and annoy them. Ain't that the fucking truth. Well, I mean, I don't mean to bother anybody. I just, you know. I mean, I just talk with people, and I feel like this is the only way I can express myself. I come from a poor family and, ah, I mean, I don't really know most of my family unit really, you know? And my parents are away a lot of the time. So, I just felt like this is the way I could cope. So I mean, I'm sorry if I'm, if I'm bothering anybody. I don't mean to and I don't wanna fight anyone. I just wanna share a laugh. And help people. If that's too much to ask, then I don't know what to say. I, I, don't know how I could change. - Well, that was fun. - Yeah. You know, I think you're right, we should get outta here. We're dead lost, we're not gonna find that other cabin. Maybe Angelica knows about us. Maybe she gave you directions to that crazy guy's house, so he would kill us and put us in his chili or something. That's crazy. I just didn't get all the directions. That's probably what it is, but we should get out of here soon because it's gonna get dark. Probably some pretty nasty wildlife around here at night. Lions, tigers, and bears. Oh, my. I love you. Ah, I love your body. I gotta take a piss. Damn, what's taking him so long? Greg, is that you? Greg? Greg? Where are you at? This really is not cool. I heard a noise, was it you? Christy, we haven't heard from you yet. I'm a lesbian and I like sex. I don't know why, I just do. I just the love the feeling of having another girl in my arms. And mine for the taking. Ah, I just can't have one. I need like 50. But that doesn't really do it anymore. Um, I tried coke. But that didn't help. That didn't fix it at all. In fact, it made it worse. And instead of needing 50, I needed a hundred girls. Even then, that wasn't good for me either. I just really want somebody that I can love. Really fall in love with. Care for. I just can't help myself. I gotta go for the gold right away or I can't focus. Then I don't want anymore after that and I feel bad. And why I really feel bad is that no one can ever satisfy me. Then I do a line. And I'm not satisfied by that either. You know, I try to go and hang around parties and meet people but the same thing, it happens every time. I end up with some new girl in my bed. We have our fun and part ways. I can't even remember how good she was. I can't let my body feel it. I feel like a prisoner under myself. I feel like a, I feel like a mess. And I don't know how I can fix it. Or even how it started. Christy, you don't have to say anymore. I think we get it and that's a lot to go through at your age. We're about 45 minutes from the south bend. We should be able to make it out about noon. Okay, lead the way. Megan, you wanna go next? Hey, my name is Megan. Basically, my situation started when I was about 15. I don't know why, but I just started feeling so alone in the world. I tried talking to people, but I could never think of anything to say. Nothing they ever said to me had any sort of meaning to it. I didn't know what to make of it, but everyday I just felt more and more empty inside. Devoid of feeling. I went to doctors, but nothing they said made any sense, either. I don't know what they got their degrees in, but it wasn't anything that could help me with my problems. They put me on codeine drugs, that was their big solution, but that just made me more depressed. And then one day I saw a straight razor left out in the bathroom. And I looked at my wrist, and I wondered what would happen if I used that straight razor on my wrist? How it would feel? So I cut myself. Something about was so satisfying. I felt a rush, maybe it was the blood loss. So I did it again. And again. And again. Until one night, I nearly died. My arms looked like I put them through a wood chipper. So, I just try to live everyday and try to be better. Don't know how I'm doing at it but I'm trying. Still feel empty inside. Anyway, that's all there is to say about me, really. Thanks for your bravery, Megan. Well, gang, I wanna congratulate each and every one of you for being really brave today. You've told us who your were, what makes you yourself, and what your problems are. You've taken a really big step by doing this. Bigger than you realize. Tomorrow, I've got some more activities planned to help us continue getting to know each other better. And I promise you'll all be happier and free for it. Well, I think we can just about call it for tonight. We can start back up in the morning. Yeah, we've been out here for hours, found nothing. No, we never do. Tomorrow we'll start up on the other side of the creek. I can't wait. Hey, I told you to stay back at the office. You were the one dick swinging to come out here. Yep, throw it my face, you old bastard. So, Laura, notice the way you've been lookin' at John. Yeah, you gonna hop on his rodney later? Maybe she's gonna give a little kiss. Laura, Laura, what's wrong? Those girls are so mean. I didn't want to go on this trip. I just want to go home. Just wanna go home. Cheer up. Look, I know the trip sucks now, but it'll get better. I promise. Okay, okay, okay, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. Oh, what's wrong, Laura? Can't you take a joke? Look, girls, you're seriously not helping. Can you just let us talk for a little while, please? Oh, why do you care? Just go now, please. Oh, God, okay, please stop. Look, you're with her all the time. You're probably creeping her out. What do you think, she's your girlfriend? I mean, how 'bout you grow a pair and stop acting like... Shut the fuck up. No, fuck you, John. You're a goddamn creep, that's what you are. And you're two busy-bodied cunts who can't stay the hell out of other people's business. It seems to be a running theme with the two of you. You run your mouths and you never shut up. And you know something, most people could change over time, especially on a trip like this, but you two, I don't think you'll ever change until somebody rips the fucking tongues out of your mouths. We're burning daylight. What do you think? We're not gonna be able to see two feet in front of our faces pretty soon. Might as well just set up camp here. Start back up in the morning. You got it. So, ah, Sammy, do you wanna get it on? We're on a mission, woman. You need to keep your focus. Yeah, whatever, your focus should be on me. I got needs to, you know. Be that as it may, we have a job to do. And so do you. Great. You sound just like your mother. Don't you talk about my mother like that. Oh, yeah, she's a saint. Don't you talk about my mother like that. Dude, let me get a cigarette. Dude, what the fuck, man? I told you no. I only have a few packs to get me through the whole weekend. Can't give any out. Now can you leave us alone. We're trying to have a conversation here. Longhaired faggot. Fuck. Where are you going? Hey, listen buddy. You and your shitty attitude are really starting to shake my dick. Leave me and Laura alone. Or what? Chad, I'm gonna ask you one time nicely. Leave us alone, please. I don't care if we're on this trip together, we're not friends and we're never going to be friends. Yeah, I'm glad. You're a fucking moron. Fucking moron, you're a goddamn mooch, you know that? Trying to bum my cigarettes every five fucking minutes. You know what you are? You're a big baby. You're a coward. You pitch a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go your way and I'm sick of it. And so is everybody else. Go in your tent and stay there. Mr., Mr. Big Bad Whore Guy. Mr. Metalhead. Mr. Longhaired Faggot. What are you gonna do with her, huh? You gonna fuck her? You're gonna fuck her. Or what, are you scared? Scared she's gonna laugh at your little dick? You know, I'll tell you what. How about you let me get in there and get in that pussy? I'll make that bitch... ♪ Feeding the need ♪ Pay the price ♪ Ultimate sacrifice ♪ Prowling sinner Bitch. ♪ When you hear the howl ♪ Prowling sinner Where are you going? John? Ah. Oh, hey, Laura. What's wrong? I just... You know, I don't like violence. I hate it. I'm not a violent person. My whole life, people always told me I would grow up to be a serial killer because I listen to heavy metal, and I watch horror movies, and I wrote horror stories, and I would draw pictures of the characters getting killed. And they never believed me when I said I was fine. When I said I didn't wanna actually hurt anybody, they just put me on medicine, and shoved me in front of doctors, and shut me out. And even now, I still don't like violence. But this guy, he, he's been fucking with me this whole time. He hasn't stopped running his mouth since we got here. And I tried to get him to back off, I mean, I really tried, but then he said those things about you and I just lost control. You shouldn't blame yourself. I'm not mad at you. Maybe not, but I'm mad. I let myself go in front of you and I didn't wanna do that. You've had people exploding in front of you your whole life. Now you, now you probably just think I'm this crazy, psycho, asshole. But I don't. Well even if you don't, when he said those things about you, I just... Look, I, I know we haven't known each other all that long, but I really do care about you. I'm never gonna let anyone hurt you. Or talk down to you or do anything like what that asshole was saying. I can take abuse, I don't care, but I'm not let him dish it to you too. Thanks. You don't have to thank me. I do it because I care. Well, thanks anyway. It's getting pretty late. We should at least try to get some sleep. Yeah. So are you bunking with me tonight? What do you want? You gonna drop me off in town now? No. You were brave to do what you did. What is this about? You know, it gets kind of lonely in here. In this cabin, all by myself. Nobody to keep me company. Why don't you come in with me? Since you're such a big, strong man. Yeah? Yeah. Shh, we don't wanna wake the others now, do we? I feel you. Bro? What the fuck, man? Payback. Wow. Unbelievable. Yeah, it really is something, right? Did I get catch at a special moment there, Todd? Hey, shut up. Hey, how much you wanna bet she's shoving a dildo up his ass? Ah, shit. Alright, buddy, I'm gonna get some sleep. You have yourself a good night. And try not to stain your underwear. Ah, yeah, yeah, man, goodnight. Good? Fuck yeah. Good. Now you gotta go to bed. We have a busy day tomorrow. Whoa, what about tomorrow? Well, we'll see, lover. It's getting late. You need to go back and get some sleep. Sleep well last night? Yeah, I guess so. Ah. So, you see anything you like? I thought you weren't into girls? I, ah, I, ah, I don't, I don't usually. So what's different now? What do you mean? Come on, Katrina. I know you were staring at me last night. Well, you, you were... Naked? Well, yeah, and... I like to sleep naked. There something wrong with that? No. How about you and I go and do something special? I, I never have. Not with... A girl? No, never. There's a first time for everything, sweetie. Yeah, I guess so. You didn't like how your man treated you, right? When he put his hands on you? The things he let his buddies do to you? Did you? No. You want something a little bit more gentler. Special, right? Yeah, I guess so. I've a lot of really bad experiences with guys, too. But girls are different. A bit more special. Really? Yeah, really, baby. Now let's go somewhere. Okay. Oh, what the fuck? Are you on your fucking period? Oh, my God. It's come to my attention that you guys let a couple of your fellow campers go missing this morning. They weren't here when we woke up. I couldn't find them anywhere. Well, that's all well and good but they haven't returned. Well, that much is obvious. I reckon those two are out huntin' for wild beaver. Well, I think it's pretty stupid that they wander off like that. They could get hurt. Look, I don't mind if you guys roam around, but I need you to stay in the cabin area. We need to stay together. I don't need another one of you going missing. Hey, where are you going? I'm going to look for Katrina and Christy. It's worrying me that they're not back yet. Shouldn't Angelica be looking out for them? This is her trip. Yeah, I know, but she has everyone else to look after. I'm not gonna be that long, and I wanna look for some signs of them. Want me to come with you? I don't know. It might get pretty dangerous. That's fine, I wanna come with you. Alright, if you can keep up. Okay. I'm pickin' up nothin' here. It doesn't make any sense. We'll find him. It's just gonna take a little time. Candy? Candy? No! Okay, this time it's personal. So, ah, you havin' fun out here? What do you want, Todd? I don't know, just, nothin'. Just wanted to talk. Look, I don't wanna talk to you right now. Okay, um, what about your book? What are you reading? Look, I know you're trying to hit on me. I'm not interested. I just want to read my book. I don't care if you hang around, just leave me alone, please. Fine, Jesus. Lying son of a bitch. Saying he doesn't have anymore fucking smokes. This fag's got another pack. Mine now, asshole. Where you goin'? Steppin' out for a smoke. Shouldn't take things that don't belong to you, you bad boy. I'll be right back. Hey, where are you goin'? Hey, where'd you get that smoke at? Fuck off. Asshole. Man, that's good. Who the fuck is out there? John, I swear if it's you, I'm gonna put your dick in the dirt. I'm not the guy you need to be fuckin' with, okay? Oh, wait, wait. So Megan, you never told me what you're reading. A book. Oh, really, let me take a look at it. Hmm, that's interesting. Hey, give that back. Oh, you want it, come get it. Hey, ah, I'll give you your book back if you let me take swim with you. What? No. - No, okay, okay. - Give my back back now. Gotta take a swim, gotta take a swim. Alright, Todd. So, if we take a swim, we won't be wearing clothes, right? We'll get them all wet. Hey! You shouldn't have done that, Megan. I can't swim. And there's alligators in here. I'm serious. Alligators are here and they eat people. Hmm. Todd? Todd? I'm the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Ah, get your hands off me. You're such a pervert. Oh, come one, it's a joke. It's just a joke. Look, you're such a creep. I don't even wanna see you right now. Okay, Megan, Megan, I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. Douchebag. Leave me alone. I don't like this, John. I don't like it either, but we have to keep searching. We have to find some trace of them. Hey, John, come over here. What do you think that is? Do you think they're hurt? I don't know, but we need to get back to camp, and bring in the authorities. Something really bad happened here. If they had just been hurt, they'd still be around here somewhere - and... - And? And there wouldn't be this much blood. I want to leave. I don't feel safe. I want to leave now. Alright, let's hurry back. Okay, fine, be that way, Jesus. I don't need you. Todd, Todd, behind you. Oh, very funny, but there's somethin' behind me, right? Behind you. Oh, very original. Let's see. What's wrong? It's Todd, he's dead. He's dead. What? There was this guy with this ax. And he's dead. What do you mean he's dead? How could he be dead? There was nobody else out here. No, that's the thing. He got him. And now he's gonna get us. Nobody's gonna get you. I won't let him. I won't let him kil me. I won't let him. Megan, what are you doing? What the hell? Give me that knife, Megan. Megan? Megan? Megan, what are you doing? Stand back or I'll do it. Megan, baby. Give me the knife. Come on, it's gonna be okay. Shh. Shh. Where are you, you motherfucker? I'll bring you to hell. Candy? Candy? Candy? Answer me, honey, it's your daddy. Candy? Burt, are you sure your daughter came in here? I saw her with that bounty hunter, that Samson Del Marr. She got the hots for him. She follows him everywhere. She thinks now she can be a bounty hunter just like him. I'm really scared because I think he's gonna get her in big trouble. We gotta find her. Well, she is in here, we will find her. I hope you're right. Let's get goin' 'cause she's in trouble. I know it. Candy? Hey, Angelica? Jesus, what the hell happened to you? Oh, I was just making dinner. Whatever. Look, we searched everywhere. We can't find Christy and Katrina, but I think something bad happened. We need to get everybody together and leave now. Well, what's the mater? I just told you. We can't find Christy and Katrina. Where is everyone at? They're out there somewhere. Out there somewhere? Weren't they supposed to stay close to the cabin? They're gonna do what they're gonna do. I can't control them. What if one of them goes missing? I mean, don't you have your career on the line for that or something? You're the one that organized this trip. - No. - What? Now is seriously not the time for sarcasm, Angelica. I'm not being sarcastic. I'm not a psychiatrist. I'd stay right there if I were you. Laura! One more step and I slice this bitch's throat here and now. Okay, alright, just, just don't hurt her. Don't worry, it'll all be over soon. Daddy's gone a huntin'. Daddy? Yes, my father. Who the hell are you? Mm, I'm someone you should have never trusted. Yeah, no shit. But who are you, why are you doing this to us? What do you care? You and the little bitch will probably be dead real soon, anyway. God, just fucking tell me. I'm doing this because Daddy and I need to eat. What are you gonna sell our bodies on the black market or something? Don't you make enough money being a counselor and doing trips like this? No, Greg was a counselor. Greg is a psychiatrist. I'm not a doctor. I just go out into the city and lure in unsuspecting victims. They never suspect. You were gonna kill him? No, I gave him the directions to some cabin in the woods. Big ole redneck lives there. Afraid of his own shadow. Greg's in pieces by now. Jesus, I can't believe this. And now with all of you here, Daddy and I will have enough food to last through the winter. You eat people? Do you wanna know what happened to my mother? We ate her. Daddy and me. How do you plan on getting away with all of this? Don't you realize? I've taken you all 10 miles away from civilization. Even if you manage to escape and tell the police, there's so many stories about the monster that they wouldn't believe you anyway. Besides, there will be no bodies left. You fucking monster. How could you actually kill people and eat them? You tell me. What? What do you think you were eating last night? My own secret family recipe. Just like I said. John, no! Get back here, bitch. You die now, you whore. I'm gonna get you, you stupid little twat. It's time, bitch. I told you I was gonna get ya. Bravo. Bra-fucking-o. Please, help me. - Help me. - I told you to shut up. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Samson Del Marr, and I'm your worst fucking nightmare. You see, I was coming out here to hunt you down because I'm the only motherfucker out there that believes you exist. I couldn't get any help from the cops, press wouldn't listen to me, so I figured what the hell? I'd come out and track you down myself. But you made one fatal fucking mistake, my friend. You killed my partner. And she was a really hot piece of ass. So now you twisted fucking ghoul, I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna tear you in fucking half. There ain't nothing gonna be left of you but a greasy fucking smear. And I'm gonna enjoy ever last fucking second of it, too. Come on, motherfucker. Let's do this. Freeze. Please, help me. - Help, oh, help me. - Shut up, bitch. You're both under arrest. Now, Lewis, why in the hell would I do that? Sheriff Parks, come in. Sheriff Parks, come in. Deputy Lewis, this is Officer Wilson from City. The guy you got guarding the road. I'm hearing shots fired, is everything okay out there? Hello? Man, something ain't right. He's my brother. That's right, and how do you kill your own flesh and blood? I know ole Gene over there is a goddamn mongoloid, but that don't mean you love him any less. Hell, we knew he was a mess when he was a boy, but no one really paid much mind until the neighbors started disappearin'. And then I knew I had to do somethin' to protect him. Now I knew about these woods here and knowing they'd ever find him, so I bring him food and supplies, and things went pretty well until about 20 years ago when I found out his fucking urges had returned and this little idiot had birthed a baby. I should have put a bullet in both of their heads right then and there but nope. I'm a softie for family. The deal was I kept you alive and you stopped killing my fucking towns folk. You remember that, Gene, huh? You fucking remember that, Gene? Do you remember our fucking deal, Gene? Do you fucking remember? I promised to keep you and that bitch alive, and you promised no more killing as long as I let you and fucking Angie live, and you quit killing my fucking towns folk. Daddy, no! Eat this, you son of a bitch. Fucking bitch. We were all in this. John. I'm glad you're alright. - Let's go. - Let's get outta here. Is something wrong, Laura? - John? - Laura, hang on. - John? - Hang on. Still hungry, you sick fuck? You're not coming back from that one. Wilson? Hello? Are you sleepin' on the job again? Goddammit, boy, I thought you said you were on road detail? Will you quit fucking around and answer me, goddammit? He ain't sleepin', man. Something seriously wrong. I'm scared as hell. You're right. Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick. God, his eyes. His eyes. We have to find Candy now. We have to. We need to get to my car, - radio for backup now. - Well, hurry. Hurry, please. Oh, my. Where'd you get that shotgun? I found it in the cabin when I woke up. Thank God. Wait a second. Did you hear something? Baby, eat. Baby, hungry. Baby, eat. Laura? Laura? John? Baby, wants food. - No, please. - Gonna eat. - Please. - Laura? Laura. I'm sick of your fucking family. John. Let's go. It's over. Candy? I'm hearing some strange sounds from over there, man. Keep it down. It sounds like they're bumping uglies. - Quiet. - I can't really... Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah. Don't ya cool down on me, darlin'. Who the hell are you, and what the fuck are you doing out here? Thank God that's not Candy. I'll do the talking here. I asked you a question, asshole. You stay warm there, honey. The name's Cletus. How many people have you killed out here, you sick son of a bitch? I ain't killed nobody. Don't play stupid, how many? I done told you. I ain't killed nobody. I just clean up all of their messes. Well if you didn't do this, then who the fuck is responsible? Gene, he killed 'em all. I just cleanup the messes. As a reward, I get to have my way with the pretty ones. I do like the pretty ones. They're nice and soft like bread. Sure do smell good. Like warm apple pie. I'm taking you into the station, motherfucker. Shit. Goddamn showing off, son of a bitch. Peek-a-boo, bitch.
