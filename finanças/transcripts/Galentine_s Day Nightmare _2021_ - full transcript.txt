The police said it came from your number. Well, that is impossible. He must have faked them somehow. Well, he was here a couple of times. Maybe he did something. It's possible. They also have a video of an argument with the two of you at a coffee shop. He claimed that I followed him there. But I was already going to that place. Look. My text to Tiffany proves it. [Notification chirp] What do we have? Claire: It's gone. Mom, you know I was going to meet her. Anna: Yes, she was. Ok. There's something else that I learned, and it doesn't look good, Claire. The police checked Brian's car and they found a tracker. So? So, it traces back to your credit card. What? He must've stolen my number. You have to tell the police about what Brian's been doing... I don't want to say anything until we know more. Claire can look like the unstable one. Especially given... Her past. And you should know, since I advised you not to turn over your phone...

Not to mention he's about to collect five million dollars on the estate. - True. But the lawyer you spoke to confirmed that he wasn't planning on asking for any money in the divorce. That could've been part of his premeditated plan. You saw the texts and the tracker. Claire Donahue wanted Brian Coleman for herself. Do we really think that anyone could get that obsessed so quickly? They'd only just met. I've seen it happen before. [Phone buzzes] The judge signed my warrant. What are you waiting for? ♪ I remember Brian saying that he had a stepdaughter. Well, did he tell you her name? No. But there was an obit for his wife I saw online. Anna: Can you find it?

No social media. No job link. That's strange. Her mother's maiden name is sallow. Look at this. Well, that must've been before Brian came along. Is there an address listed? No. But I can reverse image search it. See if it's listed on any real estate sites. Got it. 12 poppy Lane. You should have never gone nosing around in my business, Claire. That's a bad idea.

He convinced my mom to leave him half of everything in her will. And did he get it? Mm. She secretly changed it a few days before she died. Why? She feared him near the end. She was going to file for divorce but never got the chance. Madison, did you tell the police all this? They wouldn't listen to me. Since she had a history of depression, they ruled it a suicide.
