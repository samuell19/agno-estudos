Â©English subtitles by iQIYI *Main cast: Li Xian & Chen Li Nong* Hello, teacher. Thank you for your training, teacher! I can take the elixir and become the immortal! Is there anyone in our generation who will get the "White Elixir"? What's Thirteen doing here? I'm also confused. -You found it on the ground, right? -He was found on the ground as well. Yeah. Are you kidding? Be off! Have you finished transcribing the "Handbook of Claman"? Have you cleaned the academy? Are you qualified to be here? Gathering the spirits of human, nurtured by energies of sun and moon, this quintessential elixir... can transform foxes into immortals. The "Elixirs of Soul" were planted into bodies of "clamen" since hundreds of years ago, which was cultivated by the spirits of these humans. They can only be harvested at the right time. The acquisition of elixirs... has long been the most significant test for the juniors of our foxes. The quality of the elixir... can represent your power. You... How did you get this elixir? I disguised as this claman's wife... and pretended to be seriously ill. So he willingly gave me his elixir. Moving towards the Extreme Emptiness. Being faithful to the spirits. The spirit of one thing... can be the spirit of everything. Witnessing the operation of all things, I am observing their essences. All the students got the "Black Elixir". Azi is the best student who took the elixir... and became a fox spirit with five tails. The claman volunteered to give her the elixir, which shows that she was good at deceiving. On the 15th day of next month, the Night of Purple Moon, the "White Elixir of the Soul" that occurs only once in a thousand years... will be acquired by our foxes. Students of this year, come to the stage for the lots of clamen. The White Elixir is rare for thousands of years. If you can let the claman donate the elixir voluntarily, you will become the first-class fox spirit with nine tails... and the supreme among foxes. What's the matter? There is one more lot in the furnace. Who hasn't come to the stage yet? Nobody. The formal students are all here. Me! Me! Me! What are you doing? Aren't you missing one student here? If that lot doesn't belong to you, you can't get it... even if the furnace opens. Give me a chance! I got a lot. You can go find your claman... according to the notes on the lot. Why haven't I got a lot? I got one. I got a lot too. I got a lot. I got a lot. Why are you so proud? You only got an incomplete lot. Incomplete... What are they? A pair of ears? Can I take another draw? Thirteen, you only got an incomplete lot. There's a good chance that you'll fail. Anyway, I won't die. That's possible too. Even if you would survive, It'll take another 500 years... if you had wasted this opportunity. Anyway, it's an opportunity. Do you know why you are the only half-bred fox... in our tribe of red foxes? It's because... you have an impressive pedigree. You were originally an immortal fox... on the Spiritual Mountain from the Territory of Departure and Hatred in the West. You were exiled to the mundane world to go through your difficulties, but you are destined to become a first-class immortal fox... and return to Heaven. I found you by the roadside. Did you hear me? I said that I found you by the roadside. Any legend? No. Not at all? Maybe a little bit? Not at all. You don't have an immortal's background, so if you're not careful enough... you'll be beaten back to your original form. If you still want to go, here, take this treasure which can be used to kill those demons and monsters... and take the elixir. Take care. Grandpa! You are my natural grandfather! -You are the kindest to me. -Don't say that! Don't! The fact that you can take that lot... is also a providence. According to this tour, you... Thirteen... You still don't know where that claman is. Grandpa! I'll give you my most precious thing... to exchange your Ying Wuxie. Thirteen Bai, I refuse to be tied up with you. Leave me alone! You brat! How dare you steal my thing! Wait for my good news, grandpa! Elder, help me... Come out. I know you're here. Chief... Recently, many of our juniors died on the way of acquiring the elixir. The spiritual cultivation of Thirteen is not enough... I... I'm worried that he might be too careless and make too many troubles. He... He may be the one who will get the White Elixir. You... Take care of him for me. Okay. Human world! I'm here! I don't want to be here! Lady, lady. Excuse me. Have you ever seen the man in this painting? No. No? Thanks. Sorry. Excuse me. Have you ever seen the man in this painting? Maybe... not. Excuse me. Have you ever seen the man in this painting? He is Liu Daoran. No. Thanks. Let's go. This Childe, Have you ever seen the man in this painting? This Childe, The Childe who's eating the chicken... Please forgive me. Let's go. What? Thirteen Bai, did you come down here to improve your food? Is eating chicken so happy? What's the rush! I'll do it after eating it. It's killing me! Claman is already there. A pair of long ears... Claman? Where? Where? Ears! Childe, you haven't paid the bill. The bill! Don't tell me it's a... clamkey? Childe, would you like to rent a donkey? Our donkeys... are extremely tolerant. You can go everywhere you want. Childe, according to my observation, you will pass the examination... and return to your home proudly. Let's... be my friend! I'll give you a discount. No! Childe, you can share a donkey with others... You can have a cheaper trip if you return your donkeys in other places. Tomatoes on sticks! Sour and sweet! Childe, Would you consider our donkeys? Too many people! Where is he? That one. There are many ones! It's killing me! Exactly that one. Exactly! Please, please! Please save my little grandson! Come on. Thank you, doctor. Stand up! Thank you, doctor. There are different kinds of ghosts sealed in this painting. Drink a bowl of blood every day... then your grandson will recover from his illness... when the people in the paintings are dead. Thank you so much! What are you doing? The claman is here! We shouldn't stay here for a long time. Maybe next time. Are you blind? Sorry, sorry. Get up! Your head would get kicked by donkeys! Don't kick me! Childe, are you okay? Let your donkey stay away from me. My donkey, my donkey! Come back! My donkey! My donkey! Who can stop it for me? My donkey! Come back! Excuse me, excuse me! Don't run! Sorry! Don't run! My donkey, wait! My donkey. Ah! If I wasn't trapped in this box... The more you rub, the dirtier I get. Why are you dragging me? Where is my donkey? How can I know? Let me go! Let me go! No! Give my donkey back! I warn you to stop, or I will kick your ass. Isn't that your donkey? Come back! Don't run! Give my donkey back! You should pursue the donkey. Why are you pursuing me? Don't run! Come back. You, an intellectual, why can you run so fast? A gentleman... should be agile in words and quick in deeds. We got lost. Are you happy now? You spoiled my important business! Do you know the importance of that donkey? It's not my donkey. It's Daoran's donkey. Well, we'll just have a rest here. We could find it tomorrow. You are as stubborn as a donkey. It's only a donkey... Donkey... Is he my claman? You are so dull... Gosh, what a gift! Maybe this gift will kill you. You should pay me a donkey... Are you going to take the imperial examination? Me too. How about we go together? I'm not a bad guy. Give it back to me! Okay, okay. What an idiot. Are you from Tushan? My name is Thirteen. How about you? Grandma let me give that donkey to Brother Daoran. It's only a donkey. Several years ago... Daoran didn't pass the exam. We had a promise made... that we will meet by the riverside... and go to the exam together this year. Poor grandma, she missed Daoran so much... and she entrusted me with the last donkey at home and let me give it to Daoran... However, by the time I got here, I was already a day late. I didn't find him, but I met you. Everyone laughs at me for being stupid, but he never. I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep. You must help me find my donkey tomorrow. Of course, I will. Could you sleep over there? Okay. Do you know who I am? How dare you! The chief asked me to take care of you. So what? It might be a White Elixir this time... so you come here to flatter me. It's the chief's order! First, beware of a Taoist priest. Second, think about Chapter 3 and Section 5 of "Handbook of Claman": If you want a human to believe you, you should do two important things. "You should lead him into a dangerous situation. Let him become hopeless or fearful. Then, give him some hope or clean up the crises." Third... And so this humble hut of mine may shelter virtues half divine. The moss may climb its ruined stair, and grassy stains the curtain wear, but... but... but... but... but scholars... But scholars at their ease within, for all but Ignorance enters in... There are crises everywhere. The human's heart is sinful. It was Grandpa who let you help me. To protect you secretly. So you should do something for me first... Wow! My donkey! Where did you go? It's amazing! Amazing! Do you know Tushan as well? My name is Wang Zijin. How about you? Thirteen. Thirteen... How about your family name? Bai. Bai? Then I'll call you Brother Bai later. Just call me Xiao Bai. Brother Xiao Bai. Bamboo is good. Hollow inside, straight outside. They would rather break than bend. It would be better if it is drizzling, right? Let's ride the donkey. Me first. No! We can't ride this donkey. It's Daoran's donkey. Then you first. No, no, let's walk. It's Daoran's donkey. We can't ride it. It won't be destroyed. We can ride it together. No. You have a donkey, but you don't ride it. Maybe it wants to be ridden? This way? Don't worry. We'll just take a shortcut. Excuse me, is there a hostel near here? The Academy of Miserable Sea. Yes. The Academy of Miserable Sea. Don't disturb them. Do you also come to take the imperial examination? Come in, please. Knowledge is infinite. If you intend to take the examination, you must pass the Academy of Miserable Sea. Do you want to know about our tutorial lessons before the exam? Three years of examination, five years of guidance. We have custom-built lessons... including the whole set of services, from guessing the questions... to passing the exam. One teacher, one student. We don't need 8800, all we want is 88. 88 pennies? 88 taels. 88 taels of silver! Don't disturb them! Let's go, Xiao Bai. We can really guess the examination questions! The imperial examination became business here. You can't find a place to sleep... in the circumference of dozens of miles. We don't need any lessons. One room. Two guests. Only for tonight. Xiao Bai... Xiao Bai... Xiao Bai... Childe. Childe. Childe. Childe. Come here. Come. Where is... Xiao Bai. Hurry up! That way! Go! Let's go! That way. Go that way! Jump! -Xiao Bai. -Jump, bro. Sorry. Help me! Zijin, Zijin! Get up! Get up! Sorry, Xiao Bai! Hurry up! Zijin, Zijin! -Sorry! -It's me. Hurry up! Are you okay? Sorry! Sorry! Go, go! Zijin, Zijin! Jump! My target is that one. Get out of the way now, then I won't kill you. Monster! I know everything about you. You are not qualified to criticize me. Too much nonsense. Run! Xiao Bai! Zijin, run! We can meet again in the future life. Your puppet trick is superb. You are a competent companion of me. When did you brush your teeth last time? It's not elastic now. I sacrificed a lot for you. Don't forget if you become the immortal. Okay, okay. I'll make it up for you. How about my performance? It's not too bad. I have prepared for it carefully for you, to make sure he'll believe you. Xiao Bai! I'm here to save you! Why is he back? I don't have a script! How can I continue to perform? I'm not ready to act later. I just don't know how to do it. Shut up! Open your mouth. Transform your body first. Oops. Monster! Spit out Xiao Bai! Hurry up! Don't push me! I don't want to kill anything! Okay! You don't want to do it, right? Monster! -Spit out Xiao Bai! -There's gunpowder in his hands! What should we do? How can I know? Spit out! Did you hear me? What should I do? Really spit you out? What should I do? Use the unique skill! Spit out! Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai! Xiao... Let a monster do something wrong... It's a set of interlocking tricks. Risk one's life to save another... It's a trick of having oneself tortured to win someone's heart. How dare you not consult with me in advance? -How can I know? -I think my mouth got burned. Who are you? I...you... This is my master. This is my footman. Nice to meet you. See how bad I was injured! You should give me something more. Alright. I'm taking an elixir, the White Elixir! Certainly, I'll look after you when I become immortal. What if it's not a White Elixir? You're exposed so we have to play along with this situation. You just trick that claman to Jiankang City. I'll help you take a look at that elixir. Follow my guidance. Monster! Spit Xiao Bai out! Grasp the opportunity! Don't let him run away! I'll... protect you secretly. Just go! You...you are... Sorry... I'm a fox spirit. I come here to requite your kindness... Requite the kindness... What an old-fashioned reason... I won't hurt you. Don't be afraid. I'll transform back to human form. I remember saving chick, puppy, and piggy... but little fox? I don't remember... Because it was 500 years ago. I can't recall. You certainly can't! That happened in your pre-pre-previous life! It hurts! It's real! Weren't you scared? I've liked... these plays about monsters and ghosts since I was a child. I never expect that it actually exists... and I could meet a fox spirit... who would save my life. You saved me too. I remember when I was little, I fell into a pigsty and got bitten. Grandma... took this to treat me. You should... chew it up... and apply it to the wound. I don't think I'm hurt that bad... Donkey... Where is my donkey! Why are you all wet? I knew you wouldn't leave my donkey. Great! I can eat chicken if I follow you. Hey, this boat doesn't depend on paddles... Does it really depend on waves? It depends on me. It's amazing! Her name is Ying Wuxie. It's our foxes' greatest treasure. My grandpa gave her to me. This is Zijin. This is Ying Wuxie. My name is Zijin. What can she do? Well... It's useless. It's just a kind of accessories. Let me have a look. Of course not. This is the treasure of our fox spirits. Let me have a look! No. Hey, do me a favor. Okay. Is it favorable enough? The king of foxes... He is the king of foxes! He is Wang Zijin! I'm Wang Zijin. You're the kind of fox spirits that have immense power, right? Of course! I can do whatever I want. Wow! That's awesome... We are just ordinary humans. We take the examinations of provinces, prefectures, and counties. We need to pass these different levels of exams and eventually become a successful scholar. We fight for achievements and reputations. I envy your freedom... and comfort. Come on, we also have to take examinations. Really? It's just different from your way. How about you come with me to take the imperial exam? When you take your exam, I'll do something for you then. It's a deal, okay? I'm here to requite your kindness... so maybe I can grant you three wishes. Passing the examination, enjoying a happy marriage and becoming extremely wealthy. How do you like them? Okay, you can help me to find Brother Daoran. This's your first wish. Why did you always talk about Daoran, Daoran, and Daoran? My family had a history of ink-making, and our ink supplied to the academy at the county. Brother Daoran was one of the first-class talents in the academy. He became the best primary scholar when he was 17. Without him, I may not even know the words. Brother Daoran is my role model. Okay, I'll help you find Daoran. Second, heal your wound as soon as possible. I'm already fine. This doesn't count. Forget it. Maybe next time. Hey, do foxes like to steal chickens? Those are weasels! However, my grandma told me that... the most hateful thing in the world... is stealing. I thought killing might be more serious. To kill is to steal others' lives. How about lying? To lie is to steal others' trust. All of them are stealing. All of them are hateful. Xiao Bai, you are a fox spirit, so you must know a lot. Just ask, idiot. Hmmm... Do foxes have something to do with bromhidrosis? It's not a question. Don't be angry. So does it matter or not? It doesn't matter! Xiao Bai, Xiao Bai! Look over there. After we've crossed Jiankang City, we'll arrive the Imperial Examination Room, where I'll take the exam. Keep it at the hostel and we'll pick it up in two days. Okay. You don't have to worry. Let's go. Where's the donkey? Everything is arranged. Don't worry. We hardly have the opportunity to come to Jiankang City. We should really check it out. But... Let's go! So beautiful... Xiao Bai... It's the brothel! Childes, come in, take a seat. Don't go! Childe, someone is waiting for you there. He must be Daoran. Where is that page boy? Childe, just cross the bridge. It must be here. What brings Brother Daoran here? I'm looking for Mr. Liu from Tushan. Looking for someone? Everyone comes here is looking for someone. Wait wait, wait... wait... I'm looking for Liu Daoran from Tushan. He is on the second floor. Upstairs. Childe, We've been waiting for you for a long time. I make this sacrifice for you, but you are such an unfilial apprentice...How dare you laugh? So, should I laugh or "unfiliaugh"Ã¯Â¼Å¸ Wait a moment... I thought we are going to find Brother Daoran... Yes. Go! Wait, what are you doing? Wait a moment... Don't get me wrong! I don't have the money to spend. Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai! I'm here. Don't be afraid. Let me go! Xiao Bai! Tonight will be the most important night. Do we have to do it? Humans and foxes belong to different worlds, but ghosts are different from both of them. They can travel freely between worlds of humans and foxes, so they can see what we can't. They can see the location... and the quality of elixir. They sure can confirm both. Even if you fail, I'll think of a way to get the elixir, which is something you can't learn from the "Claman Manual". What are you doing in this broad daylight! It's already getting dark. Open the door! She's not going to do anything to my claman, is she? Xiao Bai! What can she do? Open the door! Waves of spring river are as high as the sea, a bright moon rises with the tide. Shimmering moonlight flows with the waves, we can find this moonlight on every spring river. Childe, sorry to have kept you waiting. My name is Yinglian. You look like my grandma... the fairy in her stories. What's that sound? It's hopeful! Will she eat him? She? She dare not do that. She may suck some blood at the most. Okay, I have to take care of my business. If it's not because of the White Elixir, I won't spend that much of effort. Childe, why? Childe, you are bleeding. My name is Wang Zijin. Sorry to break into your boudoir. I also shouldn't have some dirty thoughts about you. I'm sorry but I have to leave. May I ask your age, Childe? Thirteen. Thirteen? Xiao Bai! Xiao Bai? Sorry to bother you! Why did you run away like this? Do you dislike me? No, you get me wrong. That's not my idea. You look so gorgeous, so... I'd like to ask you... What? that...that... where are you from? Maybe the Western Regions. I don't remember. It...It... It's broken... May I ask your age, please? Your questions were so detailed... Are you going to marry me? I'm not married. What a coincidence! I'm not married, too. I didn't mean it. I meant that I haven't thought about getting married. I'll compensate for your losses. Okay, I'd like you to compensate for my loneliness. It's bleeding... Lady, what's wrong? I'm a dancer, so I have to practice hard in my daily life. You are so hardworking. Lady, why... My makeup was messed up.. I have to refine it. So... Don't move! Stand there! Don't turn around! I shouldn't look at things which do not conform to the rites... Sorry to offend you. Lady, how can I compensate for my damage? Lady? Lady? Lady? Lady? Lady? Is it too exciting? If you are curious, you can go in to see. If you are distressed, you can go in and persuade. Don't just sit and watch the game. Wait a moment. Don't be unreasonable. You can't blame me for your failure... Lady? Did I let you think about something bad? I've never met a person like you. I've never met a lady like you too. You're just like a fairy. You're so beautiful and talented. Obviously, you're here because of... your miserable fate. I don't have too much money in my wallet. If... I can get good grades this year, I must help you to get out of here... and get rid of all these sufferings. What are you doing? I won't turn around anymore. This is my favorite book, and I would like to give you as a gift. It's bleeding again... Lady, you... I... you're the only one I'll marry! Are you crazy? I'm absolutely healthy. It stops... Don't move. Lady... If we do what spouses do... before the rituals of a spouse, it'll be a humiliation to you. Lady, lady! What do you want? What the hell is it? It covered everything. Lady, come on. I'm afraid that I can't control myself. So, please tie up my hands and feet for me. I, Wang Zijin, swear to god, I will pass the exam... and propose to you, if you agree. Tonight only belongs to you and me. It's a long night... Do you... really want to discuss theories of Confucius and Mencius? No, no. That's so boring. How about The Nanhua Classic? There was a fish in the North Ocean, and its name was Kun. The Kun was so huge... and I just didn't know how big it is. Then it became a bird, and its name was Peng. The back of Peng is so huge... and I just didn't know how big it is. When it vibrated its wings and flied straight up, these wings were just like clouds hanging in the sky. When the wind blew the sea, this bird would migrate to the southern sea... Idiot, I didn't let you suffer too many losses. Silly boy... You can't sleep without his snores, right? Or you want a game of three-player Chinese poker? Give it back to me. What? Give it back to me. Have you seen it? I haven't been close to him. I don't have the opportunity to see it. I think that achieving the elixir is not my destiny. People who don't have wisdom and guts... like to complain about their fate most. Xiao Bai, I'm in love with someone. I only love Yinglian... If he's not my claman, maybe... we could become very intimate friends. Thirteen Bai, because of your background... you have been laughed by other foxes all these years. Aren't their laughter harsh enough? You're such a great guy. You have a great mindset. I'll see who dares to laugh at me. Why don't you keep laughing? -Keep pretending you don't hear me. -Why aren't you laughing? Hello? -Laugh! Laugh! -Wake up! Wake up! You're so naughty! No, no, no! Afraid of water? You'll only bully me. But I'm still happy for you. At least you could live happily ever after... as you'll never know how dumb you are. Hey, girl. How dare you play tricks? Why can't you do such a little tiny thing? The lotus that your soul possessed in is still in my hands. If I didn't have to use you to get that elixir, I could destroy you right now! I must pass the exam this time. have you ever seen this man in the painting? If you see him later, please tell him that Wang Zijin is waiting for him in the Imperial Examination Room. Have you ever seen this man in the painting? Who are you? My name is Wang Zijin. Is your father Mr. Wang from Nanjing? My father is skilled in making inks, which is... Oh, that's good. Have you ever seen this man... I passed! I won! Don't touch it! It's mine! Don't touch it! What are you thinking about? You'll take the exam tomorrow. According to your opinions, how many people will participate in this examination? There are only a few that make it... Why are you so indecisive? If you don't pass it, nobody will respect you, right? You don't have the strength to propose to your sweetheart, right? I knew it. I don't have a respectable background, just like you. Actually... I'm not a real fox spirit now. It's just an exam. If you wouldn't pass this time, you could retake next year. You studied... for yourself. I believe you can do it. You can become a real fox spirit. And a good one. I'll work hard! I can do it! God is answering me! He'll work hard! He can do it! Talk about yourself! I'll be a good fox spirit! Do it again! Do it again! I'll work hard! I can do it! He'll be a good fox spirit! We're selecting the scholars of our big country. All we want are talented people. The classics are here. Please search for what you want. However, if you want to cheat with your private notes, once discovered... you'll be punished. The Official! Please have mercy on me! Don't talk! Go in. Do you want to cut it up to have a look? Cut it here. Cut it there. Cut! Your skill is great. People who have been searched... please take the examination paper... and wait for the exam. Pass the Dragon Gate. Examination starts now. 7 o'clock in the evening. You can only pass the exam if you understand the classics. Just do it in a spurt of energy. Sit up straight! I've passed it! Ghost! There's a ghost! Ghost! There's a ghost! Ghost! Ah! Silence! 9 o'clock in the evening. Don't look anywhere else. Don't talk to anyone. Stabilize your mind! What are you doing here? Would like to do a business with you. Tonight... the ghost of this examination room will capture a bunch of students' souls, including Zijin's. Passed... Passed... I've passed. If the evil spirit is subdued, the spell will naturally disappear, which that old fox doesn't know. Zijin's soul was gone, so he won't feel any pain. It's the perfect time to kill him, as the quality of the elixir won't be changed. Three fingers next to the Tianchi point. White elixir. Did you see it? When it's done, you should help me to take back the lotus. Don't forget that, if you don't get it, your 500 years of cultivation will be wasted! I help you this time, and you should help me too, okay? Okay. Brother Daoran! I finally found you! I'm Zijin! Why are you ignoring me? I haven't seen you for so many years, Grandma has thought about you for days and nights. Many things happened at home... I have made a new friend called "Xiao Bai". Brother Daoran! grandma let me give that donkey to you. Be off! Leave! Wait a moment, Xiao Bai... Waiting for what? Your soul is leaving your body! It'll be too late if you don't go back! He is Brother Daoran I was always looking for... He is already dead! Dead? I don't believe it! Don't disturb me! I'm answering the questions! Leave now! If I can't pass, nobody can do it... We're all the same! Who can escape? Who can do it? Zijin! Liu Daoran failed too many times in this exam and died in the examination room. He became the ghost and no one could handle it. Did you forget your objective? That was White Elixir! You really want to die, right? It's over. I'm dead. Don't you want to take the elixir? Don't you want to be immortal? Don't you want to live? If you want to save others, you should recognize yourself. I can get you out of here, only if Liu Daoran can remember the past. Don't worry about being alone... on the way ahead. It's up to you to decide... how far my light will reach. Don't worry about being alone... on the way ahead. Brother Daoran! Zijin! Here's the ink. Thanks, Zijin. I'll give this pen to you. You should study hard later. Thanks, Brother Daoran. Don't worry about being alone... on the way ahead. Everyone in the world... knows my heart. Zijin... Maybe one day... you'll walk into the examination room. The pen in your hands... will draw a bright future... and support your great ideal. If you and I could be talented and great contributors... we should not be greedy for the earthly attachment. Families, confidants, lovers... even what we think when we first pick up the pen... can be discarded... if it's for merit and fame. Zijin, when we meet again, the names of you and me... will be written into history and epic. Don't worry about being alone... Don't worry about being alone... on the way ahead. Everyone in the world... knows my heart. Brother Daoran! Zijin. It's been a long time. Brother Daoran! I missed you. Both grandma and I thought of you every day, waiting for you to go home. It's too late. Everything is too late. It's all that I can do. Wuxie... I don't have to be stuck in this box anymore. Thirteen, farewell. Zijin, you should be careful. That fox spirit has followed you all the way... only to take the elixir of the soul in your body. 3 o'clock in the morning. Please enjoy your meal! Xiao Bai! Thank you for saving me again. It's Ying Wuxie who saved us. She was supposed to be with my grandpa... It's my fault. If you have any wish, you must tell me. I also want to do something for you. Xiao Bai, what is the elixir of the soul? It is... It is a... elixir. Do I have it? I can give it to you. I'm totally fine. Xiao Bai... I have another wish... I want to get Yinglian out of here. She used to be an orphan, abducted by human traders, sold to Peony Brothel as a prostitute. She finally jumped into a river to commit suicide. Her resentment was too powerful, which made her soul possessed the body of this lotus. Then, she became the best beauty in Peony Brothel. She ate human hearts... and sucked their blood... to maintain her look. You've already known it. Only someone who really loves her... can help her release the soul. Will you help me to meet my second wish? You should think twice... I, Wang Zijin from Tushan, have sincerely prepared the betrothal gift... for asking Yinglian from the Peony to marry me. This wedding is a chance for you... to take the elixir with the help of that ghost. What a luck for you loser. Just follow my lead. Ms. Yinglian... will you marry me? You've known that I'm... Yes, I've known it. That's why I become more determined. More importantly, I've promised you before. I love you sincerely, so I don't care if you are human or ghost. I get along with tree demons. I'm used to fool around in the human world with these companions. I've got no attachments. Scared now? Do you want to marry me now? Yes. I'm a flower ghost. You'll die soon... if you are with me. It's because you don't like me? Life... should be wasted on people you love! Silly kid, we met by chance like patches of drifting duckweed. If my life... can make my dearest families or lover fulfill their wishes, I won't consider it as "waste". Everyone will die, sooner or later. I don't have the ambition to save the whole world. I only hope that everyone I care about... can have a bright future. I'm only a poor student... who was despised when I was a kid. I've been worrying that if I fail, I won't be able to give you a wealthy life. But I've been thinking that... fame is nothing more than a weapon, which will make me more capable of protecting others. On this way of taking the exam, I made a bosom friend, and I also met you. This is what I have always dreamed of. Under the sun, the moon and the sky, witnessed by mountains, rivers, ghosts, and immortals, I... wish that Yinglian and I can be wife and husband. We can take care of each other... until the advent of samsara. We won't separate from each other forever and ever, whether we are alive or dead. I'm late for being in your life, but in the future, I'll... never let you suffer any grievance. Zijin... Sorry. Old fox, you listen to me. I quit! Zijin... Come over. Xiao Bai... Don't go over there! He wants to take advantage of the wedding to take the elixir. Yinglian, you're mistaken. I made him a promise. Zijin, don't trust her! Don't act like you're trying to save him. You're the one who wanted him dead. Yinglian, no! Xiao Bai! I can't let him lie to you anymore. Yinglian, let go of Xiao Bai. He's my best friend. Friend? He made up lies, pretended to return your favors, and cheated you to win your trust, just for the trail of acquiring his elixir! What he wanted was the White Elixir in your body! I didn't! What? White Elixir? If he wants it, he can just take it! Take it? Then you'll be dead! Xiao Bai! Zijin, just go! Xiao Bai! I never meant to hurt him... Still lying! Still protecting him! Xiao Bai! Zijin, there are many things, and I'll explain to you later. Explain what? You foxes are deceitful by nature. The time is almost up. We all know that if you don't take the elixir, you'll return to your original form. You'll give up... your five hundred years of training? Big joke. Yinglian! I'm begging you! Let Xiao Bai go! He helped me all the way. He won't hurt me! Xiao Bai! How can you be so stupid? I have to kill him today. Or he'll kill you. Yinglian, don't do it! Yinglian! Thirteen, are you alright? I had to do it. See? They're all liars. Go! Yinglian! Sorry! What can I do to save you? Too late. Forgive me... I've wasted your kindness. Sorry, sorry! Please tell me! What else can I do? I'm willing to do anything! I'm just a lonely soul... You've already saved me... with your sincere care. I have no regrets... in this life. It's a red-letter day! You shouldn't cry. I'm afraid there'll be no afterlife... Only wish Zijin peace... in this life. Yinglian! Zijin! I just pretended not to know. I don't want to know. I've always trusted you. Always regarded you as my best friend, my brother. Have you ever been sad? Have you ever shed tears for anyone? I'd rather die just now... than believe that this is all your scam. You said that you've never stolen... but you're a liar. Where's Yinglian? Tell me where Yinglian is! You stole everything from me! All you want is the elixir of the soul, right? Come on! Come and get it! Do you think that I really want to get it? The acquisition of elixir is my exam! What can I do? Enough! What's all this for? How I wish you were not my claman... because you are my most cherished friend... in my world. Go away! I should never have come to take this elixir... and I shouldn't have lied to you. I owe you this... I'll give it back to you now! Xiao Bai! Thirteen, salute to Priest Zhang. He has been supervising your spiritual practice in the human world. Without him, you almost made a big mistake. The White Elixir... only appears once in a blue moon. Stupid kid, what occurs once in a blue moon is not the White Elixir... but people who can truly sacrifice their lives... for each other. You haven't possessed the wisdom a thousand years ago... so you certainly didn't know that you once met a herb-gathering kid in the mountains... who saved your life. That tear is the elixir you planted for yourself. I thought it was a casual talk. Unexpectedly... The fox... who had planted it... should take it himself. It's not your fault to take the elixir according to your fate. Over the years, you are the only one who had taken the White Elixir. I want to know ... what happened to the claman... who volunteered to give you the elixir. He has already entered the samsara. The best fox furs! Have a look! Fox? Go away, go away! Poor things. Dad has said that... foxes are bad creatures who tell lies. But it's so sad. The fate of the claman has long been doomed. You can't run away from your fate. I know, it's hard, but you have to get through this process of acquiring the elixir. If you take it, every problem will be solved. Everyone will respect you. If you don't, 500 years of effort will be wasted. This is the spiritual practice. It's providence. I get it. Thirteen, it's the last hurdle, and you have to do it yourself after all. I know... you won't forgive me. I lied to you all the way... I did all the things only to take that elixir. It's true. It's impossible to say that... I won't be sad. Just pretend that... you never knew me. What'll happen to you if you can't get the elixir? Xiao Bai! You've always been with me all the way. I thought I had made the best friend. I thought I still had a long life ahead, plenty of time... and plenty of stories. I thought there would be you... and Yinglian in my life. And I'm the happiest person in the world. If it's all because I have one more thing... that is available for your use... You can just take it. Sorry... I don't remember things in my previous life... so I don't want to have any more regrets in this life. I can now assure that my visit to this world... is worthy. I know that becoming immortal is the most important thing to you. I'm willing to do it for you. Let me make my last wish... you'll be a good fox spirit. I'm... willing to give you the elixir as a gift. I knew that you would come. He was happy. At the last moment, he still thought that the elixir could help you become immortal. I was intended to bury him with kindness... I overestimated you. It's just an ordinary Black Elixir. I wasted all my efforts on it. You'll pay for his life! What can you do? Why do you think I followed you all the way? How can it be your turn to get this White Elixir, which only occurs once in a thousand years and I can't even get it? You were destined to be trash from the day you were born. You don't know what you're capable of. How can you fight me? If you want to die with him, I'll let you. My name is Wang Zijin. How about you? Just call me Xiao Bai. Brother Xiao Bai. Sorry... I'm a fox spirit. I come here to requite your kindness... I don't remember. Because it was 500 years ago... If you have any wish, you must tell me. I also want to do something for you. Zijin, Sorry. Stupid kid, what occurs once in a blue moon is not the White Elixir... but people who can truly sacrifice their lives... for each other. The fox... who has planted it... should take it himself. It's not your fault to take the elixir according to your fate. But you're immortal. Isn't that what you want? Xiao Bai. I know that becoming immortal is the most important thing to you. I'm willing to do it for you. I'm... willing to give you the elixir as a gift. You can become a real fox spirit. And a good one. If my life... can make my dearest families or lover fulfill their wishes, I won't consider it as "waste". Fame is nothing more than a weapon, which will make me more capable of protecting others. Zijin, Is this really what I want? Grandma! You're always in a daze. The neighbors are asking... Why don't you become an official... after passing the exam? Grandma, Zijin doesn't have ambitions... and abilities to be an official. It's a big deal for me... to take care of you for Brother Daoran. You always look unhappy. I always feel like I've forgotten lots of things... but I don't remember what they are. Come, come here! Don't be afraid! Why are you hurt? Are you in pain? Can I take you home? Then I'll treat you. Do you have a name? Let me give you a name. How about... How about Xiao Bai? Do you like it? Zijin, I wish you hadn't met me. Then, there would only be one less nine-tailed fox spirit in the world. Zijin, I'm going to be immortal. This is the last time I lied to you. With immortals from the heaven and the earth, if the scholar Wang Zijin could be reborn... I,Thirteen Bai,am willing to give up my life's work... and take the punishment of the thunder and earthquake. Idiot, there's no more Thirteen. You'll forget everything. You'll be the same old Zijin. Okay... only the snake will dance with the sound of the flute. From the beginning... I doubt that the deaths of juniors of foxes were no accidents. It's the difficulty you set for yourself. Thirteen might be the only pity. That kid will finally become immortal. How can you know that he's not happy now, and he won't be happy in the future? Granny Li's chicken was missing. Did you steal it? Say something! I found them! I found the chickens! Mum! I found them! I found the chickens! Sorry... I got you wrong. Remember. Never steal other people's chickens. Did you understand? Drink as much wine as you like at home.
