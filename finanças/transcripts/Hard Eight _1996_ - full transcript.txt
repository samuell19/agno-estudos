No, I don't think so. Come from Vegas? Reno? From Vegas. You lost some money? No. You won some money? I broke even. What were you playing? Blackjack. You know how to count cards? What? You said you were playing blackjack. Do you know how to count cards? No. In my experience, if you don't know how to count cards, you ought to stay away from blackjack. - Thanks for the tip, Mr. Helpful. - Hey, John. What? Hey, John, we're sitting here, I bought you a cup of coffee, I've given you a cigarette. Hey, John, look at me. You wanna be a wise-ass, go outside and take a seat. If you want to talk to me, you want to talk to me... Well, then. Never ignore a man's courtesy. Let's talk about Vegas. Let's talk about what happened to you, because something did happen. Maybe I can help. You wanna help me? You look like a man that could use a friend. You wanna be my friend? Then give me $6,000. Do you have that? Can you give a total stranger $6,000? Because that's my trouble, okay? - What do you need $6,000 for? - I need it. For what? To bury my mother. You went to Vegas to win some money? No, I went to lose some money. You went to win some money to bury your mother? To pay for her funeral? That is very admirable. I admire the intention. I can't say it's wise, though. Do you have $6,000 to give me? No, I can't. I didn't think so. Isn't there someone who could...? Nope. Family? There's no one else, okay? It's me, it's just, I'm alone and that's it, okay? There you go. That gonna be it? - Uh, yeah. I think so. - Thank you. How much money do you have left? Nothing. If I were to give you $50, what would you do with it? I'd eat. How long can you eat, how long can you live on $50? I don't know. I would bet not very long. You would bet. I tell you what... You come with me back to Vegas, I'll loan you $50, I'll show you what you did wrong. Why? What are...? Look, what are you, man? You think you're St. Francis or something? No, I don't think I'm St. Francis. Are you looking for a fag? I'm not some boy hooker if you are. I'm not looking for a hooker, John. I'm offering you a ride. I'm offering to teach you something. Well, I'll telling you something right now. I don't suck dick, okay? I understand that. And this is the last time I'll ask. Do you want my help? I'll fuck with you if you fuck with me. I know three types of karate, okay? Jujitsu, aikido and regular karate. Okay. Alright. A, you give me a ride. Two, you give me 50 bucks. And C, I sit in the back. And believe me, if you pull anything, I will fuck you up. I believe you. This is a nice ride, actually. Comfortable. Can you pull over for a second? Can I get a cigarette from you? Thanks. The lighter, there, it doesn't work. Here. No, thanks. Lighter doesn't work. I heard ya, I just... I just don't use matches. Wanna hold the wheel a minute while I light mine? Thanks. You gonna smoke that? Nope. So why don't you use these matches? It's just a rule with me, okay? I don't use matches. Why not? I had a bad experience once, and I promised I'd never use them again. Tell me. You know those big monster books of matches, like those big daddy ones with, like, 40 matches in them? I had one of those in my pocket once and they just lit, just exploded. - Matches just went off? - Yeah, it was like... Something to do with spontaneous friction. They just went off. I'm standing there in a line for a movie and all of a sudden... wham! Like that, you know? Scared the shit out of me. I had a third-degree burn on my leg. It was this close to my dick. I mean that was a, that was a brand new pair of jeans too, you know? I mean, I thought about suing that match book company too. You know, what are, what are ya gonna do? Things happen. Shit just happens, you know? You just deal with it. John, I'm gonna loan you 50 bucks. So, why don't you tell me what you're gonna do with it? - You asked me before, you know. I... - You could take it and play with it. Play it a certain way. Long enough and hard enough to get a bed and a meal. You're not gonna win $6,000, though. I can assure you of that. Well, you, if you show me how to do that, you know, I mean, how to get a meal and a bed, then I'll do that. You know, I mean, if you wanna show me. First thing you do is you go into the bathroom, clean yourself up. There's an attendant in there has a razor you can use. - Yeah, but I'm growing a beard. - Once you're done, look in the bar. - How's that? - Much cleaner. Okay? - Much better. - So, what now? First of all, I lied when I said 50. You're gonna need 150. I knew it. Hey, hey, hey. Just relax, John. Listen to me. You listening? Go over to the slot machines to that woman in the cashier's cage. Ask her where you can find the floorman. She'll point to a guy in a tuxedo, the floorman. You find this guy, you approach him, and you say... "John Finnegan." So, anyway, I just, like, I just flew into town, and... You know, I'm gonna be playing this casino. I like this place. And I'm gonna be spending some money and I hope I win some money. I just need someone to keep track of what I'm spending, you know, 'cause I'm an impulsive gambler And... can I get a rate card? I got it. He gave it to me. Good. You take this $150. You take it to that cashier and you cash it in for dollar tokens. He'll make a note on the card saying the amount and the time of day. - Hi. - Hi. I'd like 150 in dollar tokens and here's my rate card. - There we are. Good luck. - Thanks a lot. Now you're gonna find a slot machine. Find one to the side a bit, but don't go unseen by the floorman. You sit at that machine and you play $20. Only 20, so make it last. Play slowly, one dollar at a time. Did you order a drink? - Did you order a drink? - Oh, yeah. They're free. It'll turn out to be a $150 cocktail. Don't drink. - Okay. Sorry. - It's all right. - Did you finish that 20? - Almost. Get your stuff. Come with me. Give the cashier $100 in tokens. She'll give you cash. Get a bill. - Hi. - Hi. I'd like to cash these in, please. Would you like a bill or some twenties? A bill. - There you are. - Thank you. You're welcome. Now you're gonna give this cashier the bill and the rate card. And ask for more tokens. I'd like another $100 in tokens, please. Here's my rate card. - Good luck. - Thank you. So how much do you have on your rate card now? Uh, well, I cashed 150 first, then another 100, so, 250. And you have only spent $20. So you just keep circling the bill, John. Cash to tokens, tokens to cash. Now, slowly spend what's left of the 50. That's just for show when the floorman comes around. Do it for an hour, take a break, do it again for an hour, and so on. See ya around. - Where? - I'll find you. - Hi. - Hi. Look at that. Started with half of that. - We're not as lucky. - We're losing big time. You are? Yeah, I haven't been playing that one. Put a lot in here, though. I'd like to cash these in again for a bill, please. - Good luck. - Thank you. Oh, well... I need a bucket. I need a bucket! Guess who. Making a pretty big investment here. I need another 300 in tokens, please. There we are. Good luck. Yeah, I'll need it. Thanks a lot. - Hey. Hey, Sydney. - John... I kept doing that until I racked up two grand on the rate card. And it worked. They gave me a room. Guy comes up to me and he's like, "Can I get you anything, sir? You know, a room? Tickets to a show?" I got two tickets to a show. I got you one. Plus, that machine I was playing? I actually hit if for 200 bucks. - It works. - Fucking A it does. - This what you do? - Not anymore. Shit, Sydney. This is great, I mean, really. Thank you. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. I got that, uh... The 150 that you gave me. - All right? - Good. You want to hang out? I got pay-per-view movies and I got a mini-bar. It's got all kinds of stuff in it. No thanks, John. So, John, what are you gonna do? I don't know. I was, uh... I don't know. Well, you can't keep doing the same thing all week. Yeah, I didn't think so. Uh, Sydney... I was gonna ask you... You know, I was wondering... I mean, I know you showed me all this stuff, and you taught me... but I still have to, uh... You can't win $6,000, John. I told you that before. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have a friend in Los Angeles, someone, maybe, someone who can help. I can make a call for ya, tell him you're a friend, so on and so forth. Maybe we can work this thing out here. I think if you need help paying for your mother's funeral, we can work it out. I want you to see that my reasons for doing this are not selfish, only this: I'd hope that you would do the same for me. I would. Thank you. It's always good to meet a new friend. I'll see you later. Are you gonna gamble? Yeah. Can I come down with ya? - If that's what you want. - Yeah, just to watch, you know. Cupid! Cupid has found its way. If there's anything you want, please don't call. Keno? - Keno? - Yeah. Play $2, please. - Hello, Captain. - Hello again. Do you remember my name? Clementine. - That's right. - Just like the movie. Exactly. - Do you remember my name? - Sydney. Then why do you call me "Captain"? Because you seem like the captain of a ship to me. I see the way John follows you and worships you, like you're his captain. John is a very old friend. Good luck, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Boy, you're a good tipper, Captain. Tell me something. Are you required to flirt, to behave as you do toward that table of men over there, maybe as some part of your job? Uh, they don't say to do it. But if you don't... Well, then I get questioned, like, "Why were you so rude to them?" I mean, I can't talk back. I can't tell them to fuck off and leave me alone. As a rule. I'd also lose the tip. Sounds like an occupational hazard. You don't have to do that with me. Jimmy paid for your drink. Thank you. Thank you, Captain. Hey, thanks. - You want another? - Yeah. I'll have whatever Syd's having. Hi. Hello. Syd, you remember Jimmy. He's a friend, lives up here. - Thanks for the drink. - Hey, my pleasure. Have a seat. - Jimmy works over at the Sand Dunes. - Oh, yeah, I remember. What do you, uh...? You do what? Well, I did some consulting there. You know, security on busy nights. Parking lot? No, no, I work inside the casino. And he saw you playing Vegas a few years back. Jimmy, tell him. Yeah, yeah. See, I used to live there. I saw you playing crap over at the original Dune. You bet the hard eight for 1,000 and you pressed it for two. - Did I hit it? - Nah, you didn't hit it. But it was a big balls bet and I remember your face. Stupid bet. You were with that old dude with the voice thing. He talks like that. What's his name...? Excuse me. Say, partner, let me get one of them cigarettes. Oh, damn, you ain't got no menthol? - No, man, I don't do menthol. - Shit. Alright, let me get a light too. So you gave up big balls bets on the hard way to play keno, huh? What's that, a sign of ageing? It passes the time. Syd and I saw a guy win 38 grand playing keno once. Played all day, sat in the same spot, something like 12 hours. Must have cost him 4 grand to win the 38, but Jesus. The other night over at the El Dorado, I saw a cat have a heart attack right at the craps table. He's in the middle of a hot shoot, getting all bothered and sweaty, and next thing you know, bam! Old fucker just keels over. Now, the joke of it is, the game just keeps going on. I mean, people are yelling, "Place the 8. Somebody call an ambulance! Place the 9, place the 6. Somebody dial 911!" And this old bastard's laying on the floor, tongue out, turning purple. Like and people are still playing! Keno! - Keno. Any winners? - Uh, no. Not here. But, um... let's try it again. Jesus, we are fucking surrounded by pussy here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jimmy. What? Not for my ears, but hers. She can hear that sort of thing across the lounge. It puts her in a very uncomfortable position. I doubt if hearing she's got a great pussy makes her feel uncomfortable. I just don't want it coming from my table. I don't know if you knew this, but, you know, half the women that work here are take-away whores. They get off on that shit. I got a friend, works over at the Sand Dune, where I work. He's in charge of corralling all the cocktail waitresses for that. I mean, he's in charge. He is the pussy patrol. - Jimmy. - What? Just, you know... Hey, I live up here. I know what flies and what don't. You know, you tell a babe she's got a nice ass is no crime, believe me. You said it as she walked away. Hey, Jimmy, let's go play. We're waiting on our drinks here. Yeah, we'll get 'em at the tables. You got a point. Sydney... it was a pleasure seeing you again. John here's got my digits. Anything you need in this town, you call me. Syd, I'll see you later. I'll be here. Hi. What are you doing out here? Fresh air. I was... I was just visiting my friend. But we're not supposed to be in the rooms, you know, so... I could lose my job. But you'd be fired if you told them to leave you alone? Um, this is something... I mean, if the hotel knew... You live alone? Yeah. I do now. I had this girlfriend, this roommate... But it's a big nightmare story. Do you go to school? No. Do I look like I go to school? I don't know. Maybe. I'm not with all that, you know? What are you saving up for? Your job, the money that you make. Are you saving? No. I mean, I have to make money, you know? I have bills. I have an apartment that I have to pay for. I have a car. I mean, that costs money, you know? Every month I have to pay bills. If I don't, my credit gets fucked up. And I can't have fucked-up credit because then I'm fucked. You think I'm a piece of shit now because I was in that room. No, I don't. Just a good girl, you know, trying to save up, open a beauty salon. Maybe that, yes. I don't know. I don't want to open a fucking beauty salon. It's just so much different than what you think. Explain it to me, then. I don't... I don't do anything that I don't want to do. You understand? Are you, um...? Are you gonna tell John that you saw me? No. I'm not. So... I want to know, like, how do you know him? - So you took care of him? - Sort of. And you paid for the funeral? We worked it out. I think he's pretty adorable, the way he looks up to you. He orders the same drink as you, you know? He dresses the same. We share the same tastes, I guess. - Do you have kids, kids of your own? - Yes. Are you married? A boy and a girl. No, I'm divorced. I have a boy about your age. A daughter 2 years older. Where do they live? Well, I'm not sure. I haven't spoken to them in a while. Well, that's too bad. Yeah. Maybe you'll see them. Maybe. Fuck this! I'm outta here! I'm gonna, uh... I'll get a robe and some shorts or something. Here's a robe. Here's some stuff for you. - Captain? - Yeah? Do you want to fuck me? Do you think that? Well, you brought me here. Do you think that? I don't know. Well, you should know before you ask a question like that. Well, it seems like you're being nice to me and... - You'd think that I would want that. - Well, if you wanted to fuck me... Stop saying that. - It just seemed like... - Well don't let it seem that way. This is a comfortable bed for you. I want you to sleep on it, to give you something... a place to have a nice shower and a bed. Well, don't get angry. No. I'm not, because I understand how you could ask a question like that. Now you really look at me as a piece of shit. No. Alright. John won't be back until very late. He won't disturb you. This is John's room? Not tonight. And boom, it just exploded right in my pants. Totally burned a hole. - The matches went off? - I could have, like, caught on fire. - Hey, Captain. - Morning, Captain. Good morning. That is a nickname that Clementine has given me. - That is not for you. - Okay. - So, what are you gonna do today? - Oh, I don't know. But if you want to do something, to go someplace or buy something, John'll take you. Yeah? You need something? I mean, just to go home and get some clothes. So why don't you go to the mall? Buy something nice? Here. - No, I got it, Syd. I got money. - Oh, okay. So, you wanna go? You wanna get something? Yeah. I mean, yeah. And that is that. See you later. - Bye. - Bye. Well? Why do you have two TV's? Oh, well, see, they got pay-per-view here. That's this box. And there's a wire that comes up from the front desk that goes through this box and then when you pick a pay movie, it tells the front desk that you got a pay movie. Then you take these things off, stick a key inside this little cuff right here and twist it around and then you take the wire from the wall that brings the movie, you take that and you put it straight into the TV. You gotta use a regular TV, so I bring this one wherever I go, and I just take the cable that comes from the wall straight into this TV. - And you get free movies. - Cool. But don't say anything to, like, the front desk or anything. - No, I won't. - They'd me make pay for all of them. So... I gotta go talk to Syd for a second, alright? I'll be right back. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. - How'd you do last night? - Fair. - You? - Oh, I won about 300. You didn't show up in the bar. Oh, I'm sorry, about that, Syd. I was with Jimmy, - you know. - Yeah. I'm sorry about last night. The second drink, you know. He gets... Not a problem. Yeah, I know, he just gets a little flagrant, you know. It's fine. He thinks you don't like him. I don't. Well... What? I don't know. You be good to Clementine today. Take her anywhere she wants to go. Did you...? What? - What? - You know, did you...? No. Okay. Good. Good. Alright, I'll see you later, alright? Yeah, I'll probably be in the sports book or maybe poker. Okay, maybe I'll see you there. - Okay. - Alright. Excuse me. - Can I get you anything else? - No, that's fine. Thanks. Seven the winner. Pay him on the pass line. Winner seven. Coming out again. Bet 11 after 7. Come on, Old Timer, you gonna join us here, my friend? Come on! I don't wait for old people, I don't wait for old people...

I'm gonna light a cigarette and let you have this time to place your bet before I finish. And when I finish lighting I'm gonna just roll and fuck you. You're laughing at that?

Are you okay? I'll get up right now. John! Syd? Yeah, open up. - Everything cool? - What? Yeah, everything's cool. Are you all right? I'm fine. You gonna open the door? I said on the phone, you know, it's kinda screwed up. Yeah, so? Open the door, John. Let's see what's going on. You promise you'll help me? John, it's cold out here, open the door. - Is everything cool? - John, open the goddamn door! - So, what's going on? - Shut the door. - Why are the lights off? - Okay, Syd... Just leave 'em off a second. John, I'm not gonna stand here with the lights out. Okay, now, you promised you'd help me. What is this, John? I'm sorry, Syd. John, what is this? Who is this man? He's uh... he's a hostage. - A hostage? - Yeah. Why? Because, uh... for money. Is he dead? No, he's just, uh, passed out. How did he get here? I'm sorry, Syd. Fuck! I'm so sorry. I fucked up, I know. I know it. I'm sorry. Clementine? - Clementine. - She doesn't want to talk. What? You all right? I'm fine. Tell me what happened. This man won't pay me. You know this guy? No, not before tonight. I mean... Then why does he owe you money? I met him in a bar. We came here. You came here, what, for sex? - He won't pay me what we agreed. - How did John get here? You can ask me. - She called me. - I asked him to come help me. The fucker hit her, Syd! Clementine, let me see. Come on, let me see. You're okay. - How long you been here, John? - Me? Since 10. So why don't you just let him go? - What do you mean? We can't. - Tell me why, John. - Because he owes her money. - Yeah, so? How much money? $300. You're holding this guy hostage for $300? That's what he owes her. This fuckhead cheated her, Syd. Who knows this man is here? Well, me and Clementine and you. Yeah? And? - And his wife. - His wife? Well, someone's got to get the money, Syd! I don't understand. How did you get in touch with his wife? He's staying at the Sand Dune. I got the name from the wallet and Clementine saw her there before. You talked to this woman? You talked to this man's wife? Yeah, I called her and told her to get the money. She said she would. - Did you tell her where you were? - We're not stupid. No, of course. You're not stupid. Are you gonna help us? So? What do you want me to do? I don't know. This guy's wife has obviously called the cops. Do you understand that? - No, not necessarily. - Yes, necessarily! No, she wants to deal with it as much as we do. She's not gonna tell the cops that her husband was, you know, fucking... Fuck! I mean, she might not, right? She might not. What'd you tell her, John? What? I just said that we would call her and tell her what to do. No, no, no. Did you tell her that you'd kill him if she didn't? What'd you tell her? Yeah. - Yeah, what, John? - I told her we'd kill him. This is a very fucked-up situation here. - Well, you promised you'd help me. - I didn't promise anything. Yeah, yeah, at the door. Come on, Syd, you gotta help me. You don't have to help us. - I sure as hell don't. - Then get the fuck out of here! Oh, good. Good. You got yourself in this situation. I did not get you here. So, you humble yourself, do you understand? You humble yourself. Give me the fucking gun, John. Give it to me. - Is it loaded? - No. Where'd you get it? - From Jimmy. - Jimmy? - Has Jimmy been here? - No. - What does Jimmy know about this? - Nothing. - Don't say that, John. - I'm not. - What? What are you saying? - Nothing. Clementine, get in the chair, will ya? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Now, answer every question that I ask you now. Don't look at John. Look at me. Now when you left the hotel this morning, where did you go? We went shopping at the mall. After that? We went to my house. Why? - I wanted to get some clothes. - I told you to buy clothes. I wanted to get something! - Alright. After that, what? - Syd, just ask me. - We had sex. - Then, yes, what? You want to figure this out, but who cares what happened this morning? I'll judge that. Fine, then just ask me what happened. I'd like to know how you go from being at the Sand Dunes with the guy to being in here. Where did this thing go wrong? Because he thought he was smart and I was stupid and I'm not stupid. Well, this is a pretty stupid situation, isn't it? Well, we'll see how fucking stupid I am when we get my money, won't we? You know the first thing they should have taught you at hooker school? You get the money up front. Fuck you. - Syd, don't talk to her like that. - I'm having a conversation with her. - Well, don't talk to her like that. - John, shut the fuck up! Hey, I'm warning you, Syd! Don't talk to her like that. She's my wife! She's... we got married this afternoon. Bitch! You're fucking dead... Right? I am glad to see you are having a wonderful honeymoon. Syd! Syd! What, wait. Where are you going? Syd! Syd! Don't leave, don't leave, please. - John, I can't get involved in this. - You don't have to. But don't leave. John, if I stay here, I am involved. I'm part of it. Do you get that? Okay. Now, let's just go back inside, okay? You've got a guy unconscious in there. A guy you... A guy you kidnapped and are holding for ransom. Do you realize how fucking serious this is? Alright, look, John... If you want me to help you get as far away from here as possible, then you just get in your car and go. Yeah? Let's do that, John. Let's just get in the car. - Well, where am I gonna go? - I don't know, John. Anywhere. Away. How could you let her go and do a thing like that? You've got money. This is not good. Syd, we were at the bar, I fucking turn around and she's gone. You know, I didn't know she... What do you think? I didn't know. Did you really get married, John? Did you? Yeah. You know, she said yes. I didn't want her to say no later on. I'd been seeing her for 2 months and never had the guts to say anything. And I saw her in my bed this morning, like a sign from heaven. I know this is fucked up. I'm not stupid. I know I fucked up. Okay? She's got some problems but I really love her. What am I gonna do? - I love her, Syd, and I... - Okay, okay. Everything's going to be fine. Everything'll work out, you'll see. Alright, come on, we're gonna go. We're gonna leave. Syd thinks we should leave, so get your purse, Clem, and put your coat on. Why is he doing that? - I'm getting rid of fingerprints. - This guy saw us. Well, maybe he'll wake up and he won't remember. If he doesn't remember when he wakes up, then why are we leaving? If he does, the cops are gonna come, Clem, and they're gonna check. - I'm not going anywhere. - Look, we don't have a choice. John, I'm gonna tell you something right now. This man owes me. He fucked me and now he's gonna pay me. Don't be crazy, alright? Don't be crazy, honey. I mean, this is the only thing we can do, okay? This is the only thing we have a chance at right now, is if we leave. I'll tell you that you can go, but I'm not. Oh, you wanna get caught? You wanna go to jail? I want my money. Clem... Clem, look at me, please. Let's just listen to Sydney, okay? Syd knows. He knows. I won't tell them about you, if that's what you're thinking. Jesus Christ, Clem, that's not why. What do you want me to say? What do I have to fucking say? I love you. You wanna stay here with this fucking idiot? You wanna be separated from our marriage, from me? I don't care. Well, fuck you then! You stupid fucking whore! Fuck you, John! Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, Clem. Oh, God! - Stop it. Jesus Christ, John! Stop it. My darling Clementine. Listen to me, will you? Are you listening? If you stay here, you will be caught. Okay? We're talking about kidnapping, extortion. Other things I don't know what, but not good things, honey. Okay, honey? Clementine, look at me, will you? Come on. Look at me. Do you love John? He slapped my face. Do you love him? Yes. Alright, you've got that. You love him and he loves you, and you're not gonna spoil it on this bullshit. All right. Okay, where'd you get the handcuffs? - They're mine. - Give me the key. What for? I have to unlock him. - Did you hit him with the gun? - Yeah. Alright, come on. Let's get outta here. Hey, don't forget your cigarettes and your lighter. Let's go. Who's that, John? Who's calling? I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - Syd, I don't. I don't know, okay? Who knows you're here? I don't know. Maybe the guy's wife. It's the front desk. I don't know! John, don't fuck with me. Syd, I'm not fucking with you. It's the front desk. I don't know! Jimmy knows we're here. Look, Jimmy knows we're here but it doesn't matter, alright? Let's go. Let's go! Right. Then, let's go. - Syd, I'm sorry about Jimmy. - We'll talk about it later. Get your car. Follow me to Clementine's. She's coming with me. Now, tell me. A man checked into the motel. Yes? Tell me that. Yes. - The man behind the counter saw you? - No. - What about in the bar at the Dunes? - It was full of people. The guy had a specific friend, maybe somebody at the bar with him? Right over there. Syd, I'm on the street. Are you okay? I'm really scared. I know. You be strong now. Take good care of John. Oh, my God! I'm so embarrassed. I'm so embarrassed, oh, my God. I feel like I might piss my pants. I have two cats. I remember. - Will you feed them while I'm gone? - Sure. Okay. The yellow key is for the top lock, okay? The red one is for the bottom one but you can't put it all the way in or else it won't open when you turn it, okay? And just one can and put it in the bowl. And water. There's something, uh... for you. We... it's our wedding. We had it taped, we thought... Oh, that's nice. Thank you. I don't know. God, I don't know why I did this. I'm so stupid. - It's okay. - Fuck. No, it's okay. Everything's going to be all right. I'm ready. Alright, you've just got married. You're on your honeymoon. - But what about my job? - I'll talk to the casino. I'll tell them you've fallen in love and ran off but you'll come back. So, you call me when you get there and we'll see where things are. - You got money? - Yeah. Okay, I'll get you more money as you need it, as much as I have. As much as you'll need. Do you understand? As much money as I have. Alright, where are ya gonna go? - I don't know. - Okay, why don't you go to...? - Oh, shit, goddamn, I don't know. - Vegas? No, Jesus Christ, John! Go to... - What about Niagara Falls? - Yeah, Niagara Falls, that's fine. No, no, not Niagara Falls. - Why not? - I've been there before. Jesus Christ, John! But Niagara Falls is like a regular honeymoon place. - Yeah, but I've been there. - John, John. Go to Niagara Falls. Okay. Hey, give me a hug, will ya? - See ya soon. - Okay. It's gonna be all right, John. Hey, John, look at me, will ya? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. John, this is fine. - Take good care of Clementine. - I will. And drive the speed limit. You tired? Not really. If you want to get it annulled... Do you? No. I won't fuck up again, John. I really won't. I promise you. If you know of nothing to prevent your union in marriage, and wish to take its vows and assume its obligations, please face each other and join hands. Will you, John, have this woman, Clementine, to be your wedded wife and promise to loyally fulfil your obligations to protect her, honor her, love her and cherish her?. I do. Will you, Clementine, have this man to be your wedded husband, and promise that you will be unto him a tender, loving and true wife and be faithful to him as long as you both shall live? I do. You may seal your vows with a kiss. I'd like to introduce Mr. and Mrs. John Finnegan. Bless you. Thanks very much. Thanks a lot. - Thank you. - Congratulations to you. Oh, man, hey. Could you please not smoke in here? No, seriously. Could you please not smoke in here? The smell gets in the upholstery. It fucks up the re-sale value. - What do you want from me? - To put that cigarette out. Well, I'm not gonna put the cigarette out. All right. Can I have one then? So you got my note. What am I saying? Of course you got my note. - What do ya want? - Nothing. Do you have something to say to me? You know, that was a really fucked-up situation back there. You took care of it. So, John and Clementine are safe. Yes? - You were there. - Just for a minute. - You know that guy? - Guy? Oh, the guy that fucked Clementine. Hell, no. No. I saw him today, though. You saw him? In the casino this morning, walking around like nothing happened. - Maybe he didn't call the cops. - He didn't. You're so sure. I was here all day and all night. If they were here, I'd have seen them. The motel's right across the street. This guy's just trying to avoid personal embarrassment. What about his wife? Well, now, he may have some explaining to do there. So you don't think that she called the cops, huh? Look, if they'd a been there, I'd a seen them. This guy see you? Nah. He was knocked out by the time I got there. - You gave John a gun. - Hey, he was scared. It wasn't loaded. I wouldn't give John a loaded weapon. You, um, you still got my gun? I threw it away. Oh, damn. I loved that gun. Why do you want to talk to me? That's all right you threw my gun away. I have others, you know. Look, I was there with John and Clementine, you were there too. You want something now? I ain't call you here to say I know about this and I'll squawk unless I get some of the pie. John's a friend. Clementine she's a doll. And you? Hey, you're a classic. You're an old timer. I got some respectability for that. What is there to get, anyway? Yeah. So now, what then? So, John and Clementine are on their way to safety in... Niagara Falls. So, everything's all right, huh? When did you talk to them? Last night. Look, this motel thing's got nothing to do with nothing anymore. Thankfully, that's done. That's over. I didn't mention it in my note, but... you should be aware that I know some things about Atlantic City. I mean, I'm from back East originally. You didn't know that, but I know some things about Atlantic City. Where you going? Hey, Syd! Hey, I said something to you. Don't walk away from me. I said I heard the story about Atlantic City. What? What? What? What? Tough guy, huh? You can tell me? You can tell me what? I haven't told John, but I know about Atlantic City. You shot his father in the face! Shit. - Turn it off. - Uh, don't! Turn the car off, man, or I'll shoot you! I swear I will shoot you in the foot and let it bleed. Now, turn it off! Now, John doesn't know you killed his father but I will tell him. I'm threatening you with the word, understand? - Do you want me to do it? - No! - I want $10,000 to keep quiet. - I don't have $10,000, Jimmy. - Bullshit! Yes, you do. - No, I don't have it. I will go to Niagara Falls and tell him. Don't! Please don't! - $10,000, Sydney. - Alright, I'll get it. - Yes, you will. - When? - I want it now! - No, I can't now. It's impossible. Bullshit! - Not now. It just isn't possible. - Are you telling me no? Is that what you're saying to me? You fucking idiot. I will put bullets in you for it. Understand? - Alright, I'll get it tomorrow. - You can't get it tomorrow. Now! - Please don't point the gun at me. - I want the money now! You hear me? - I want the money now! - Don't point the gun, Jimmy! Please! Call me a tough guy, huh? Well, I am a tough guy. This gun in your face is real tough, ain't it? Look, I have $6,000, alright? I'll give you all that I have. - Then that's what you'll give me. - Okay. When? Don't do this to me. Where's the money? It's in the bank, Jimmy. I have it... It's in the bank. Come on, come on. Sit over here. Sit in this glass, it's yours. Sit on the sofa. You got a cigarette? - You want some coffee? - No. - Anything? - No. Now, we're gonna be here till John calls or the bank opens. Understand? Now, you got to understand that... this is not easy for me. John's a friend. You're his friend. Now, what I mean is... What I believe is... that you killed his father like the stories I heard go. Now, if somebody killed my father, well, I would feel the need to do something. Now the stories I heard, and you know, stories get around, is that you used to be a hard ass. You were a hard ass and you took his dad out, Sydney. So you think, what, that you can just walk through this life without being punished for it? Shit, man. I know all those guys, you know. Floyd Gondoli, Jimmy Gator, Mumbles O'Malley... They like to sit around in Clifton's and talk, talk, talk, talk. They love to tell stories. No, you can sit there and look at me sideways all you want. You probably think I'm some kinda asshole but I'm not a killer... like you. You walk around like you're Mister Cool, Mister Wisdom, but you're not. You're just some old hood. The other night in the bar, you, asking me a question like do I do parking lot security? Well, the answer is no! I'm trusted security inside the casino. I'm trusted with security and I don't fuck it up. Good that you have such a sense of responsibility. Don't, don't, don't... Don't fucking do that, you understand? I can see right through that shit. You look at me as some idiot, huh? I know you do. I know you. You old guys, you old hoods. You think you're so fucking above it. So high and mighty. And what am I to you? Some loser? No. No! Not with a gun in my hand. Not with the facts I know. Bottom line, Sydney... No matter how hard you try, you're not his father. I have the money here. I have the $6,000 here, not in the bank. I have it here. I knew that. I knew you did. I have the money to give you right now, in this moment. I will give you all that I have. Maybe before, you were going to kill me. Maybe. I don't know. I know John and I love him like he was my own child, but I can tell you this, I don't want to die. I killed his father. I can tell you what it was. I'm not begging for clemency. All that matters.. I do not wish to sacrifice my life for John's well-being, but I will sacrifice this money for mine because you have asked me. Because after this, I will have done all I can for John and for myself. Now, I'm going to ask you with all the heart and sincerity that I have, please do not put a bullet in me and please don't tell John what I've done. I hope that once I give you this money, you and I will take separate paths and that this negotiation will settle everything. That is my hope. I don't want to die. No, no, man. Not here. Come on. Hello? Syd. Hey, Syd! Ya there? It's John. Wait, hold... Shit. Hold on. How's that? We're in, uh, Rock Island, lllinois. We should be there tomorrow morning, afternoon sometime. How's everything back there? Yeah. There's no problems, nothing? The guy and... Everything is fine. How's Clementine? She's good. Clem! She's, she's good. She sends her love. Yeah. Yeah, I will. I really love her, Syd. I mean, I know that whole thing and everything, but... I really do. I know. Uh, I'll be here for a while. Alright. Look, this phone's gonna run out of change any second so I'm just gonna say so long now, and I'll call you when we get there, ya know? And thanks for everything, Syd. Yeah, John... There's something I need to tell you. It's something you need to know. It's important. I need to tell you I love you, John. I love you like you were my own son. Thank you, Syd. I love you too. Call me when you get there. Okay, I'll speak to you then. Everybody ready? Everybody ready? Got your money down? That's what I'm talking about. Stay on this horse. Stay on this horse. Are you sleeping? You gotta keep me up. One more time! You got your money down? Hold it! - 2,000 on the hard eight. - Me too! Alright, let's go for it! Now we get it! Don't smoke now! Got 'em in my hand, got 'em in my hand. Be there! Eighter! It's coming hard eight, just like mine. Whoo! Hard eight! Yes! Yes! That's what I'm talking about. Whoo! Yeah, pull that shit off, baby. Let me see that pussy. Let me see it. Yeah, let me see that thing. Get out. It's Christmas again. December is here. Hasn't it been a wonderful year?. All the plans you're making, all the time you're taking, to greet the next one with good cheer. Won't you dear?. As you ring my chime just because it's Christmastime. And on the tree all the ornaments go. Tinsel will cover where the branches don't grow. These lights all over houses, spouses with their spouses. Children playing in the snow. One in the sleigh and one upon the horse. Keeping on track's another matter of course. That's the great deviser, you are now the wiser, maybe just a bit less so. Touch and go till you step on a dime. All alone on Christmastime. Christmas again. December is here. What did you wish for?. What did you fear?. Look at your behavior, looking for a savior underneath the mistletoe. You should know it is less a crime to be all alone on Christmastime. Christmastime. Christmastime. Christmastime. Christmastime.
