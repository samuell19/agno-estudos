(dramatic music) (dramatic music) (beeping) (whooshing) - Governess to 75. Switch from automatic to manual. Proceed with caution. - [Man] 75 to governess. Switching to manual now. - 75, 75, what the hell are you doing? 75, 75, report! - [Man] Fuel malfunction. Repeat, fuel malfunction. - [Man] 75, lose altitude, lose altitude. Find the clear malfunction. - Acknowledge. - [Man] Governess to 77. Maintain present course. Governess to 75, report your situation. - [Man] Malfunction persisting, repeat, persisting. - [Man] Governess to 77, terminate exercise, terminate exercise. Governess to 75. Make for emergency eject barrier. Alerting rescue systems and alerting rescue systems. Acknowledge. (suspenseful music) - [Man] 75 to governess. Proceeding to eject area. 75 to governess, out. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (beeping) - [Man] An unidentified aircraft moving towards violate defense area moving at high speed. (speaking foreign language) Red alert. (sirens wailing) - [Man] Unidentified aircraft on final approach. All proceed to runway. Repeat, all proceed to runway. (garbled speaking) (tires screeching) (gun firing) - Charlie? (laughs) Guess what? We finally got it! Yeah but we were waiting for him in Tokyo. Oh, that explains it. (laughing) That is just what I said to Admiral Nakamoto who is with me now. Hey Charlie. I didn't know you had those problems too. (laughing) I thought your congress would be much more generous. Fine. I'll see you at the lunch then. Nakamoto-san. Now it's all in the hands of the politicians. Think we can trust them? (laughs) - Good. Good. That means you'll inform the secretary of state. Yes sir. Thank you. Be about 10 minutes ago. Not in Japan. Hakodate. No no, Hakodate. Yes sir, absolutely intact. I guess it's what you'd call mint condition. - [Kathy] Coffee, Mr. Crays. - Kathy, one more thing. (taps) Get me Mike Saxon. - Saxon? He's an 813, that's Tokyo isn't it? - Yeah, that's Tokyo. And try and make it as fast as they do in the movies. (phone ringing) (speaking foreign language) One moment please. It's for you. (giggling) - Hey. What are you doing with that? Yeah, this is Saxon. What? Hokkaido? Why didn't the son of a bitch have enough class to make it all the way to Tokyo? Alright, alright, I'm on my way. What the hell do you mean? What's television this time of the morning? The things I do for the company. (mysterious music) (coughs) Okay. The party's over. (low murmuring on television) Nuh uh, I've gotta go. - It's the last time Saxon, I warn you. - I've got to go. - Was at the office of the prime minister within 30 minutes of the landing. - Hmph. - [Reporter] The pilot whose name is not yet known has surrendered to the Japanese military police. No official statement has been issued as yet (razor buzzing) but it seems evident that the Soviet Union will bring pressure to bear on the Japanese government to return both the plane-- - Screw you and all Americans. - [Reporter] It also seems likely that-- - [Woman] Stop calling, Yankee. - The major powers in the world will want to learn all about a plane so revolutionary that it can fly-- - Kanji? - Under the Japanese radar-- - Saxon. Yeah, I know what time it is. - At such an incredible speed. - Look, I need some equipment. - At this very moment-- - CIA knows, people at Langley know. You got a pencil? - European, African, and Asian countries are converging on Hakodate airport. We switch you now live to Hokkaido. (militaristic music) (sirens wailing) - That's it from northern Japan at Hakodate Airport, this is Herb Daniels reporting. (suspenseful music) - [Reporter] Commissioner, can you make a statement at this time? (airport announcements being made in background) - [Reporter] Commissioner, do you see this as a political issue or a military one? - [Reporter] Is there negotiations over fishing rights with the Russians? (clamoring) Can you say if this was an accident, the violation of Japanese airspace? (helicopter whirring) - That'll be the chopper bringing the pilot in. (clamoring) - [Reporter] Has the pilot given any indication as to his reason for the situation? - [Reporter] Are the planes armed with missiles? (suspenseful music) - [Reporter] Was the plane forced down by Japanese fighters? - Do you come here very often? - I think I've got a good shot of him. - Oh yeah. Oh, you think you got the real one? Do you really think I'd bring him out this way? - If I can be of any help just let me know. (phone ringing) (speaking foreign language) (phone ringing) Oh, General Anderson. Oh, it's you Charlie. Yes, they have given me the order to break up the Foxbat. Well hopefully later today. I am waiting for it in writing. Tell me the truth, Charlie. Isn't that the way you were made a general? (laughing) - [Reporter] The Soviet Union today (suspenseful music) expressing great displeasure with the Japanese government over the handling of the Russian MG 25 fighter plane, the Foxbat. After they recalled their ambassador to Moscow. (beeping) (beeps) - Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late sir, my name is John Williams. - Don't tell me, it won't be your real name anyway. - As a matter of fact it's not. - Mine's Anderson and it really is, and this is Roberts. - Hi. - Hey Charlie! - How are you? - This is what we've been waiting for, eh? Just wait til you see these home movies. Boy, they're really something. - [Charlie] Good, fine. - He's a hell of a pilot. (laughing) - Good morning, gentlemen. We thank you for getting up so early to be with us but we think you will find it worth your while. Yesterday as you know, a pair of Russian aircraft traveling just above water level managed to get under our early warning system and land on the Japanese mainland. It is a Russian-built aircraft. A MG 25. Gentlemen, I give you the Foxbat. (dramatic music) It is a most remarkable piece of engineering. We shall now look at the components and we shall see how the Russians put it together. And what makes it one of the most effective planes in the air today. - Professor Nagata, the USA of course tested similar materials and found that the friction at such high speeds created so much heat that the materials buckled. How did the Soviets get around this? - Were these materials tested at ground level? - [Charlie] Well naturally. - There's your answer then. Foxbat is only geared to go beyond mach 3 over 60,000 feet. Now let's take a look at the engine, gentlemen. It is a Tormansky R266 turbo jet. With a thrust of 24,250 pounds. (voices overlapping) The answer is simple, no rivets. All the seams are electronically welded. Lights. That's all, gentlemen, thank you for your kind attention. - [Reporter] Today the Japanese air defense ministry announced that it is conferring with the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the NATO nations (suspenseful music) about designing a new and more effective radar... (peaceful music) (birds flapping) - The students need more practice. - It is the reason behind the bow and not the target that is important. - Sometimes the target is reality. - Reality can sometimes be illusion. Hong Kong. - My contact? - Lamont. Saxon. Reality or illusion? (bow twangs) (birds flapping) (shouts and cheers echoing) (applauding) (shouting) (cheering) (applauding) - Alright! Is that alright? You like that, huh? Alright, how about under my arm now? Oh alright, that's what I wanted. Well, hey listen. Will you say that again please? (mellow music) (cracking) Hey, take it easy. Easy. (smashing) (punching) (shouting) (speaking foreign language) (shouting) (screaming) (screaming) - Wasn't that the brilliant physicist Slakov? - Yes, the property is concerned about his attitude so he's presently undergoing some psychiatric therapy. By the way, have you met our Dr. Vod? - No, but I've heard much of him. Russian father, Mongol mother. - Yes, he's a strange man but useful. (machines beeping) (cat growling) - As you see, the effects of his dose wear off rather quickly. But with a larger amount, gentlemen, the human mind can be totally controlled. And you wish me to leave my laboratory? Hmm. Bureaucrats. - What of the animal? - He has been through the brain barrier. His mind is hopelessly destroyed. He will be disposed of. Control, gentlemen. Mind control. Shall we? - [Man] With the necessary documents and an American passport you should have no problem blending in with the inhabitants of Hong Kong. (screaming) (sinister music) (bird screeching) (whooshing) (speaking foreign language) (singing in foreign language) - Hey! What are you, some kind of a nut? (speaking foreign language) (laughing) - Now I know I'm back in Hong Kong. (whispering) - Good afternoon. Girls. (giggling) The secret of Chinese cooking (cracks knuckles) is... (gasps) Preparation. Ingredients. Seasoning. And Sampling. - Lucas, the thousand TV sets I ordered for the factory. Yes, I know, you're three weeks late. A promise is a promise. Attend to them, eh? Thank you. (speaking foreign language) This is not what I had in mind at all. - There's a gentleman to see you, sir. - Well get somebody to help you, you won't be able to finish it alone. (beeping) - Mr. Lamont? - Yes. And you must be Mr. Saxon. I trust your recent Japanese acquisition has proven satisfactory? - It has and you damn well know it. - I believe we've spoken of 15% commission. For my making the arrangements. - We talked about 10% and if the selling price were to exceed 50 million, then it would go up to 15%. - No harm in trying. - For the next few months, you will learn the secrets of excellent Cantonese cooking. When I'm through with you (gasping) you can all open your own Cantonese restaurants in the United States. In New York, Boston, and all points west. (gasping) Thank you. - Amazing! - It really is amazing. - I'm afraid we've no more time today girls. For the next lesson we are going to learn some wondrous things to be done with the simple chicken egg. (clapping) (murmuring) Mrs. Lamont, isn't it? - Yes, I'm Madame Lamont from Indochine. - Oh, Madame Lamont. - Merci. - I can't help noticing you seem to learn everything so quickly. I also think that you will be the loveliest lady in your husband's fashion show next week. - How did you know about that? - Well your husband is so famous. Everybody knows. Especially of the beautiful Madame Lamont. (speaking foreign language) Au revoir. - [Woman] Mr. Dahlbeck, your call to Langley Washington is on the line. - Sir, what's Mike Saxon doing here in Hong Kong? Special branch tipped me off. If you ask me sir I think the heavyweights are moving in here. - Well the company will be sending you reinforcements by tomorrow. So hang in there, you're doing a good job. But don't let Saxon out of your sight for one minute of the day. - Right sir. Goodbye sir. - Crays, are you sure that you're the right man for this job? You and Saxon go back a long way together. You were in Katanga and Chile. - What about Angola and the Bay of Pigs? - [Man] Well this is no place for friends. We may have to act with extreme prejudice. In which case... - In which case? He has to go. - We don't know yet. But let one man start on making his own career and where can it lead? You never know, another goddamn senate committee. Christ knows I'm not paranoid. I'm just trying to run a secret service. - I suppose it's all in here. - Dahlbeck, your man in Hong Kong, any good? - Well he's no heavyweight, but he is expendable. - Hmm. We all are, kiddo. We're all expendable. (dramatic music) - Read your instructions carefully, gentlemen. They will not be repeated. Time to have a toast, gentlemen. With some good Russian vodka. (speaking foreign language) For one among us this is more than a toast. One who lacks the proper dedication, who talks to Americans and English. For him, this is a farewell drink. His identity will be apparent in no more than 60 seconds. There will be a momentary discomfort, nothing more. - What if there's a mistake? - I make no mistakes. Remember, gentlemen. Control the simple emotion of fear and you control the world. To Foxbat and success. (funky music) - Mr. Lamont, as one of Hong Kong's leading textile manufacturers how do you feel about people from all over the world coming to attend this show? - I do this once a year to meet my friends. I hope they will enjoy the afternoon's showing, thank you. - [Reporter] Thank you. - Mrs. Lamont. - Hello. - How are you, congratulations. - I know Mr. Cheung, so glad you could come. This is my husband. - Hello. - There's Miss Hill. Isn't that superb? Look Mr. Cheung. - Superb. - Oh hi. - How are you? - [Mrs. Lamont] I wondered what happened to you my dear. - I got caught in traffic. - Oh. This is my husband. Miss Hill. - Enchante, madame. - A pleasure. - This is a personal friend of mine, Monsieur Cheung. Miss Hieu is from New York, she's a designer. - Forgive me. (light music) - Hi handsome. You like Chinese girl? (laughs) - I did until now. (shouting) (hitting and kicking) - [Cop] Back here! - It's okay, just a couple of fags. Hi pal. Hey, I don't know who you are, I don't know who you work for, but whoever they are, hey, they can do better than that. (chuckles) Have a nice shave. (funky music) - Why don't you take a picture and I'll autograph it for you? - Looks like the whole gang is here. Altman, Musad, all the buyers. Here, I'm gonna go find out what's going on in the fashion world. (applauding) - Lovely. (funky music) - Mr. Cheung, your mouth is open. Why are you staring? Haven't you seen brothers and sisters in Hong Kong before? - Brothers and sisters? - Black people. We don't come from Mars, you know. - Oh, please forgive me. It is just that you're so lovely. - Come on, let's go. - You know what to do. - You know Dahlbeck, it's strange how one little airplane could cause all this trouble. There's Saxon! Saxon, what the hell are you doing here in Hong Kong? - I'm here to see a beautiful fashion show! You know how much I love the beautiful ladies. - Over here. You're supposed to be somewhere else. Now you show up in Hong Kong? Man you're talking to people you shouldn't even know! - What big ears you've got. - Hey, don't get smart with me, fella. - Then you call off your bloodhounds. I don't like being tailed by my own people. - Your own people? Man the word going 'round out there in the street is that you've gone into business for yourself. - Free enterprise, the American way of life. Like apple pie? Or didn't you learn that in school? - School. Man. You really think you can get away with that? - Sure, and you know what? You can tell the old folks at Langley that I've got enough stuff stashed away to burn them! (chuckles) Relax, sweetheart. You're just a little out of shape. Have a nice day. (low murmuring) - This is one of our latest range, multicolored separates. Aimed at the 18 to 20s market. - May I help you sir? - Later. - Just in time for the coming season. Thank you. Saxon, you finally arrived. - You son of a bitch, you really tried to have me blown away. - Why should I have you disposed of before you delivered the merchandise? - Look, just don't play games with me. Get it done, will you? - May I have a Coca-Cola please? Ah, thank you. Hey! Slow down. You're exceeding the speed limit. - Yes I was. - Are you a buyer or a designer? - I'm a supplier. - What do you supply? - Dinner for you and me tonight, eight o'clock. - I'm sorry, I'm really pushed for time here in Hong Kong. - I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that we see each other again. - You know for my party I pay $500. - Five? - I hate to leave but I really must go now. - Five, yes. - 600? (laughs) Will 800 do? - Thank you, thank you. - Now you must make a special dessert for this occasion. (mysterious music) (beeping) (sighs) - Oh boy. - So what's next with Mr. Saxon? - Only Mr. Saxon knows. Headquarters at Langley say that there are no limits. That means if it comes to it, acting with extreme prejudice. - A bottle of water in 1628 please. In other words, you have the authority to-- - If he rolls over, he goes down. And knowing the love between the CIA and the Washington Post they would really appreciate that. - Well. - By the way, did you check for bugs next door? - We're clear in 1628. 1630 is your room. - Give me 1630, will you? - Yes sir. - Now don't get any wrong ideas. Saxon's been on the brink for months. Maybe even years. But nobody at Langley has the time of day. He's tired, he's seen too much, been through too much. And that includes the glass eye. But you know, keep trying. You're on the way up, Dahlbeck. (beeping) (knocks) - Room service, sir. - One moment. Come on in. I was beginning to think there was a water shortage. Something for you. What the-- (gun fires) (beeping) - Damnit! (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (speaking foreign language) - Hello. - Hello, how are you? - How are you? Your first trip to Hong Kong? - Yeah. Nick yourself shaving? - Yeah, you might say that. Just a bit, yeah. (laughing nervously) (elevator dings) Have a nice day. - You too. Harry! - I don't know where people shave themselves these days. - We can't find Crays. - You let the more dangerous one get away. Be sure he does nothing to harm Saxon. At least not until after tomorrow night. (honks) (dogs barking) - Welcome, welcome. You must be-- - Chan's my name. - Of course. - Pleasure to meet you. (speaking foreign language) Your man can join us? - He stays with the car. - As you wish. You're just in time for cocktails. I understand you've just flown in from the States. A business trip? - Yes. By the way that was quite a fashion show you put on. - Your briefcase, if you please. Just a precaution. - Of course. (chuckles) Of course. (speaking foreign language) - [Mr. Lamont] And are you a native of Hong Kong, Monsieur Chan? - No sir, San Francisco. - Oh. - But I'm a great traveler. - Mm. - Do you know Saigon? That is my home. - Is that right? - Right. - A fascinating city before the difficulties. (laughing) (buzzing) (speaking foreign language) - Who is it? - Ugly man. - Oh, he's arrived. Let him in. Oh Mr. Cheung, I'm glad you could come. I thought you were not going to make it, all the guests are ready, hurry up. - Oh I'm sorry. - Now everything is laid out for you. - Oh Mrs. Lamont, you are (speaking foreign language). (speaking foreign language) - Oh I am sorry it means very, very beautiful. - Oh you're naughty, Mr. Cheung. Have you got your secret recipes? - Oh yes, of course. - Good, good. (dogs barking) - Yes please. - Hold those dogs, I'm not lunch. - Ah, the guest of honor has arrived. Come in dear fellow, everyone's waiting to meet you. - He's arrived. - We're on our way. - Thank you Mr. Saxon. - Let me introduce you to everyone. May I present our very special guess, Mr. Saxon. Sir Harry Allen. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Mr. Altman. - Hello. - Mr. Saxon, Mr. Musad. Monsieur Decoutel. - How do you do? - Of course you know my wife and Miss Hill. - Nice to see you again, Mr. Saxon. - Nice to see you. - [Mrs. Lamont] Oh, Miss Hill? - I don't believe we've met, Michael Saxon. I'm from New York. - Henry Chan, San Francisco. - San Francisco. - Right. - That's great, that's my favorite city. - Is that so? - Yes, and by the way, how are the Dodgers doing? (laughs) - You must have been out in the Far East too long, Mr. Saxon. The Dodgers are the hated enemies of ours. From Los Angeles. The Giants, however, they are doing very well. - Are you in the clothing business too? - No. I have a lot of irons in the fire. Right now you might say that I'm in salvage. - Oh, I promise you the best seafood between Hong Kong and San Francisco. - The only thing between Hong Kong and San Francisco is the ocean. (laughs) (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) - You know I really have to watch my calories out here. A few more meals like this and I won't be able to fit in my own designs. - You'd fit fine in mine. - [Mrs. Lamont] Oh, did you hear about Foxbat? (silverware clatters) - Foxbat? Sounds like a vampire movie to me. - This plane is unlike anything the Western powers have seen. It's fast, it's highly maneuverable, and it's quite extraordinary. - The Russians aren't too happy about it. They want their plane back. - That's hardly unreasonable. - But what does Foxbat mean? - It's the name of the airplane. It's been in all the newspapers. - Mr. Cheung, we're almost ready for you. - Good, I am almost ready too. And Miss Hill, she is ready too? - Yes, Miss Hill is ready too! - Good. - Come along. - Okay. - Ladies and gentlemen, the piece de resistance, may I present Mr. Cheung, the master chef and my personal teacher. - Good evening, Miss Hill. (laughs) - Good evening, Mr. Cheung. - You made another conquest. - I hope you will all find this dessert quite memorable. It is an ancient Cantonese delight called the dream of a peony garden. It is a secret recipe from an emperor of the Ming Dynasty. Made from sweet almonds. - Ladies, shall we leave the gentlemen to their tiresome business talk? - A splendid idea, my dear. - Mr. Cheung, why don't you join us girls and show us some recipes? - Oh yes, it's a pleasure madame. - So far everything checks out. - Fox one here. Outside Lamont's house, everything quiet so far, out. - Okay Keith, let's go home. (clock chiming) - Well gentlemen, as you may have heard a recent special delivery has been made to Japan. And I find myself in the fortunate position to act as broker for the merchandise. I'm afraid it will not come cheaply. - In today's market, gentlemen, diamonds are much more valuable than money. If one were to pay, say $30 million for some Japanese merchandise, how can he be certain of the quality? - You received an invitation? Than you must know that the goods are genuine. And you, Sir Harry, what do you say? 65 million. - Oil, gentlemen. The Western world cannot survive without it. And this year my country is producing over 100 million barrels every two weeks. - 800, 800 million Chinese. Men women and children. (laughing) Worldwide enjoyed my dessert. It is kneaded so softly making it so digestible. Unlike most Western food. Oh. For example. (gagging) (mysterious music) - Listen, don't you know better than to take somebody else's medicine? - Medicine? It's only candy. - Oh no no no no. You could end up with convulsions. - What? Convulsions? - Yes, convulsions. No no, really, I don't want you to die. I wanna save your life! - Perhaps I could drive you to hospital. - No, I'm taking him to my own doctor. - Hospital? Oh no no no no-- - Just a minute, Saxon. - Please leave me, I don't want-- - Mr. Cheung and I had a date this evening. - A date? - No. - I'm coming with you. - No you're not. - Mr. Cheung? - Please! - Cheung and I, we're going alone. - Mr. Cheung? - Oh wait for me Toni! - Mr. Cheung? (dogs barking) - Toni, Toni! - Mr. Saxon. - Let's go, let's go! - No, Mr. Saxon come first. - I was the highest bid, I insist you honor my offer. Now stop that man. - Get in. - Hey, hey come back! (dogs barking) - [Mr. Lamont] Hold those dogs, don't let them get loose! - Right. (honks) (laughing) - Oh my god. - Get away! Get him off! - Get away from him! - You haven't heard the last of this. - My dear Musad, I have a vested interest in you as the highest bidder. We'll have a brandy together and see to your injuries. My dear. Are you leaving too? - I'm afraid so. - So wonderful having you. Au revoir, my dear. - Goodbye. (exciting music) - Where are you taking me? - To get that thing out of your stomach! - No! It's already dissolving! We need an antidote. (laughing) - There isn't any! - I'm going to die, I'm going to die! - You know what? If you're lucky, you might. (speaking foreign language) - Would you mind repeating that? (speaking foreign language) means you foreign devil! What are you going to do to me? - Look, I'm gonna stick my fingers down your throat, pull the lozenge out. Now relax, it'll be just like taking candy from a baby. - I don't believe you! - You dummy! Come back! (honking) (speaking foreign language) (shouting) (hits) (cries out) - Cheung, get in, quick! How did you get yourself into this mess, Cheung? I mean these aren't your kind of people. - That is the story of my life. Meeting the wrong people. I have debts. I thought that Mrs. Lamont would introduce me. I would have more jobs. That guy, he wanted to make me throw up the candy! - We're gonna get you to a nice, safe place. - In Hong Kong? Stop here! - What for? - Don't embarrass me, just wait please. - Now? - Come on, come on, quiet, quiet, quiet, listen! You've got something, you idiot! That's nice, I like that, look at that face. That's a lot better. - He's inside. - Get him here. Dead or alive. (gun firing) - He got away through the window. - He's still on the move, keep alert. Back of a cement truck, heading your way. - Okay, don't worry. We'll get him now. - Wait, come on. No, this way. Look, how can I make you understand? You're in a lot of trouble! Now get in there! - Toni! - [Michael] Oh shit. - What's going on, Saxon? Cheung is scared to death! - Look Toni, get your ass out of my car. This is not a game. - We've got company. - Split up, now! (suspenseful music) (singing) - [Chan] Good evening, Mr. Cheung. (dramatic music) (shouting) (cries out) (crashing) (speaking foreign language) (crashing) (shouting) (singing in foreign language) - Hi. (shouting) - Look. Please. Get in the car. (siren wailing) (speaking foreign language) - [Toni] Feeling better now? - I guess so, yeah. What about the bank? They still want me. - We're watching out for you. You're really safe. - Please, take that thing out of my stomach. - It's just too late for the stomach pump now. - Oh. - There's only one other way. - Please, no. - We've got one of the very best surgeons in Hong Kong. All the conditions are controlled. Look at it from this point of view. What if one of your friends in the car gets you first? - Will it hurt? - You won't feel a thing. - [Michael] In a few days you'll be back making noodles for the ladies. - [Cheung] Toni, you will stay and watch over me tonight? - Of course, you're my date. (beeping) - Show me the x-rays, please. Nothing there. Remove him. - Can someone please tell me what's going on here? - About what? - You tell me. - Look, I want you to stay out of this. Just keep out of it, go home. This is not for little girls, and it's not for tough little girls either. - You are so full of shit. - You want me to tell you something? You're right. - Oh nurse, is there any change in Mr. Cheung's condition? - They haven't begun yet, but don't worry. Dr. Schmidt is one of our finest surgeons. - Dr. Schmidt? But I thought he was Oriental, a Dr. Wong. - There must be some mistake. Our only Dr. Wong is a gynecologist. (gun firing) - Come on. (screaming) (guns firing) - Shit! - Shh! (whispers) - Okay, okay, okay. (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) - Thanks for the help. - Freeze. Drop your gun. Drop it. - Yours too. Cheung, get out of here. Go on, get out! (kicks) (gun fires) (cries out) (shouting) (speaking foreign language) (gun fires) (screaming) - Don't come back without him. Let's get the other two. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (sirens wailing) - [Michael] Get the hell off the road! (speaking foreign language) (crashing) (clocks cuckooing) (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) (screaming) - Who is it? - Good evening, Mr. Cheung. How do you feel? - Terrible. - The after-effects of chloroform. It'll pass. - Where am I? - It is not important. But where are you going? That is the question. - What do you people want? - Oh, you must be uncomfortable, my friend. Untie him. You are a master chef I am told and a teacher? Very good. To teach, to instruct. Now. We would like you to impart some of your valuable knowledge to us. - Sour? Or Sweet? - Foxbat. - Foxbat? I've never heard of this. Is it Japanese duck? Or Chinese chicken? - My friend. You are being tiresome. I think you'd better help our friend. - No, no needles. - Forgive me. I was being careless. It would never do to have you die from infection, would it? - No, please. - You see, Mr. Cheung? No pain. Not yet, anyway. - What is that? What are you trying to do to me? (gun fires) - It's frightening what a little bullet can do. Take it. Take it. You disappoint me, Mr. Cheung. Already through the fear barrier? (screaming) You see, you are not the only one experiencing an interesting evening. Would you like to help your lovely Miss Hill? (mysterious music) Interesting, isn't it? Much better than with the animals in the laboratory. - [Cheung] But what is it you want from me? - These are only small in local doses. The effects are gone quickly. But right now your nerves have been exposed like open cavities in your teeth. (screaming) Bring her. (shouting) - Oh, Cheung. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Toni. - The lozenge, where is it? Well? As you wish, Mr. Cheung. I thought you loved this young lady so much and yet... (screaming) - Chung, please tell them, please! - I don't know! - Please! (sobbing) - Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding here. I know Miss Hill that you are trying to protect him. What I do not know is why. Please, save yourself from more discomfort and just tell me where is the little lozenge. - It is no more. Leave her alone. Do what you like to me. - We shall, my friend. We shall. Keep trying, gentlemen. (screaming) (shatters) (fires) (shouts) (dramatic music) - Come on! Move it, move it! (guns firing) (speaking foreign language) - We're gonna have to find our way out of this. Are you ready for it? - Are you kidding? I grew up on 125th and Lennox. - Look if you're so bad, the name of the game the boat's over there. (speaking foreign language) - I can't swim. (speaking foreign language) - Hey, take this. Both of you make for the boat and I'll try to stall. Well don't stand there, shoot him! Shoot him! Damnit, give me the gun, go on, now! - Go on, get going! (shouting) - Sweet and sour? (suspenseful music) (shouting) - Are you alright? - I'm okay. - He's dead. Get into the boat. Get around behind him, go around! (rattling) (dramatic music) Get on the boat, Cheung. Go on. (gun firing) (shouting) (gun fires) (exploding) - Saxon? Come out of there Saxon, let's talk. The Foxbat is a mouse trap. Can't you see? I am one of the best. And so are you. Once. - Your diamonds are just slowing you down. - Hmm. - Are you trying to buy me with phony diamonds? - Where do you think you fit after this is through? In a box? With Crays leading the pallbearers? - I wonder what the KGB does to guys who don't complete their missions. You're through. Finished. (dramatic music) (gun fires) (seagulls cawing) (suspenseful music) Hi Toni. - Saxon. - I was worried about you. I'm glad you made it. Our friend Cheung does not have your Foxbat plans. Let it go. Forget it. - Saxon, they've been beating on me for 24 hours. I don't wanna have to scuffle with you. - The only kind of scuffling we should do is between cool satin sheets. Now leave that little guy alone. - I can't. You work for the company, you know the rules. - Then you're gonna have to walk over me. - Saxon, I know you. And I know what you tried to pull, but it didn't work. You're out in the cold now, a washed-up case. So get outta my way, Saxon. Or you're gonna get hurt. (shouting) - You stupid bitch, we're on the same side! (shouting) (hitting and kicking) - Come on, come on, come on! (shouting) (hits) (groans) (winces) That feels better. Well it's been quite a date, huh? - Uh huh. - Cheung, now that it's all over you can tell me. Where is the candy? - It is still in me, I suppose. - We know they didn't operate, so where is it? - I swallowed it that night. That's all I can remember. - I don't wanna have to shoot you. - I don't understand. - All you have to understand is that I want what's in that little piece of candy. - Look, won't anyone believe me? I haven't got it! I haven't. - Cheung. (shouts) - I'm bleeding! Toni? - Please? (gun fires) - Not my cake, not my masterpiece! She can't be serious. - The candy! (speaking foreign language) No. - The next one'll be through the heart. - No! (screaming) Toni! Toni! Your strong hand! - Please, help me, help me! - I want to but I can't hold you, my arm-- - It's slipping, it's slipping! (screaming) - Toni. Remember now. The candy. It was that night. I threw up. - Leave it, Saxon. We can't afford death. Look, there's nothing you can do. Besides, the company can't stand any noise so let's move it. - Fuck you! And fuck the company! You still think you're in Vietnam? What the hell do you want, a body count? First this girl, then you lose Dahlbeck. And maybe the little guy up there. How many bodies do you want? Well god damnit, how many bodies you want? (sirens wailing) (speaking foreign language) - You're going home, Saxon. - You're gonna have to go back to Langley with some heavy bullshit story about Hong Kong. (siren wailing) - Don't think for one minute you hurt the company. Nobody hurts the company. We knew you'd turn. And when you did we got every name worth knowing in Southeast Asia. Hill, Lamont, and Musad, all of them. Who do you think took care of Vod? - You arrogant son of a bitch. You love to play god. You tried to use me but I wouldn't play. You used the girl. You used each other. Who's next, Crays? The great American way, teamwork. Go ahead, use it. Shoot me in the back. Because I'm going straight down this alley. And then you'll get that prize you always wanted. The big office. The thick carpet, the beautiful secretary, and the gorgeous, big, black car. Try it! What do you got to lose? I don't work for the company anymore. Oh by the way, don't relax. The company never sleeps. (mysterious music) - [Man] Yes sir, Foxbat was shipped back to Russia this morning. (gun fires) Just a few casualties, sir. Dahlbeck, the girl Hill, and Crays. Lightweight material. There's only one problem. Yes sir. Extreme prejudice. (gun fires) (mysterious music)
