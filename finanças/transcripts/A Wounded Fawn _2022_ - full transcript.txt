-The Wrath of the Erinys, punisher of men for crimes against the natural order, goddesses of Vengeance and retribution in Greek and Roman mythology. Summoned by victims seeking justice pursuers and tormentors of the wicked until they atone for their crimes. From the blood that spilled on the earth during the castration of the god Uranus, the Erinys were born. Megaera the grudging. Alecto the unceasing. And Tisiphone, punisher of murderers. Gentlemen, I encourage you to be on your best behavior around them. A few reminders before we start the evening's bidding. All sales are conducted in US dollars. Everything is being sold according to the conditions of sale. And I draw particular attention to article one, which states that everything is sold under the terms of guaranty on an as-is basis. Although the artist is unknown, the authenticity and period of the work have been confirmed by both the Soho Institute of Fine Arts and the New York Preservation Society and comes with appropriate certification. Those who have seen it in our offices have been entranced by both the trauma and power this marvelous sculpture conveys. And with that, I'd like to start the bidding at $50,000. $55,000. $60,000. $65,000. $70,000. Are you coming in, Sam? No? Maybe on the next lot. $75,000 to Bruce Ernst. Simon, are you coming in at $80,000? I'm at $75,000 now, and I'm looking for $80,000. Kate Horna, are you coming in? Thank you, Kate. It's your bid at $80,000. I'm now looking for $85,000. It's against you, Bruce. Will you give me $85,000, please? Marcel. Thank you, Marcel. I'm now looking for $90,000. Bruce, I would like $90,000. Could you give me $90,000 please? Thank you, sir. Anyone else want to come in against Bruce's bid? Alex, are you going to give me $95,000? - Bid. - Thank you, Miss Horna. $100,000 is now with Marcel. Bruce? -You sure? So you're out, Bruce? Okay. It's Marcel's bid. -$105,000. $120,000. No? Kate, it's your bid. -One, two, five. -$125,000. The bidding is now with Marcel at $125,000. Can I get... -$130,000. -No? Fair warning to the room, I'm selling to Kate Horna at $130,000. There it is. Thank you, Kate. -Mm-hmm. Yeah, of course. Wonderful. I will bring it back tomorrow. Okay. Oh. Great work, Kate. -I'm so sorry to bother you. -What are you doing here? -I know this is highly unprofessional. -Unprofessional? More like illegal. What? Did you follow me home? -Please hear me out, okay? I'm... I'm just in town for tonight's event, and my clients insisted I make you another offer for the Erinys bronze. If the answer is no, that's okay. I will gladly fuck off down the road, but they're willing to pay double the purchase price your clients did, plus throw in an additional $25,000 bonus for you. -Why? -Because they see something beautiful, and they want it. Your client will literally double their investment overnight. -I'd also like 20% of your commission. -Jesus. You play rough. -You're the one knocking on my door. -Yeah, that... That's fair. Okay. Deal. Why don't you give 'em the call, and I'll wait outside? -Don't be an idiot. -Do you want a glass? -Oh, that's all right. I shouldn't be celebrating this, uh, deal. -Champagne's already open. Don't be a sore loser. -So, do you work for a gallery or a private collector? -A bit of both. You have very good taste in art. -Thank you. It's a baby collection, but she's growing. - Wow. - Good? -Very good. -I'll make the call. -Stop. Stop it. Stop it! Stop. -Yeah. Yeah, it was good for a while, but... that's because he kept that part of himself hidden. -Abusive men are skilled at that. Has he tried contacting you again? -No. No, I think he knows it's over now. He'll... I mean, he knows how to call the cops if he shows up again. He learned that lesson last time. -And what have you learned, Meredith? -I've learned... not to absolve a man for his transgressions against me. Bravo. -Yeah. -This was quite an undertaking. What are you so happy about? -My therapist gave me a compliment. - Hey, that's awesome. - Yeah. - How's it been going? - Really good. Just it feels really nice to finally feel good about myself again. - Yeah. -His bullshit took up so much space that I just had to learn how to not be defined by it anymore. -Hey, I'm glad you stuck with it. - Thanks. - Yeah. We know what a struggle this last year was for you. -Yeah. So, what are you doing after work? How about we go out and celebrate? - It's date night. - Oh. -Linda's going to come crabbing once this wraps up, and then we're off to try growth. -Hate you and Linda for being so hot and happy together. -You're supposed to choose one and complain about the choice you make. -Well, Mer, that just leaves you and me, so. -Okay, well, you know that I love nothing more than getting drunk and Googling murders with you. But I have plans this weekend. -What do you have planned that's better than tequila and dead bodies? -I'm getting laid. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. -The mystery man. - Yeah, that's right. - Mystery man? What mystery man? Why don't I know about a mystery man? -'Cause we're just... I don't know. -Wait. Why am I just learning about this now? -Because that's not a big deal. -Getting laid is always a big deal. I want details. -There aren't any details. I met him at an exhibit opening. He's cute. He got me tacos. We'll see what happens. - Mm. - Yeah. -Okay. Alright. I just want to know who he is and when we're going to meet him. And how big his dick is. - No, absolutely not. -I mean, this is... inquiring minds want to know. -You guys, I'm just getting to know him myself. So you'll meet him as soon as I decide that he's worth meeting. Okay? -Okay. - We're just happy for you. - Yeah. -It's been a journey. -Oh, my God. I know. I'm ready. - I know. Look at you. - She's ready? -Yeah, well, you know, if it works out, you can finally retire that vibrator. -Oh, my God. You have no idea. I had to take the batteries out of the my TV remote. -I will buy you new batteries. -We're going to get fired. We're going to get fired. -Ladies, I love you. Please don't ever forget that. -Aw. -What am I forgetting, Slice? -Bruce? -Hi. - Hi. - Is that everything? - Yeah. Just the essentials. - Wow. Stunning and pragmatic. Might as well kill me now. Thank you. -Huh? The weirdest job I've ever had. You know, I don't... I don't think I've ever had a weird job. My life was pretty dull growing up. What about you? -When I was in college, I worked for this ceramicist who had me hand paint the same fish pattern on all her vases. So by the end of the summer, I'd done it like a thousand times. -What kind of fish? -I'm not sure. It looked like this. - Cute. - Yeah. -What did you study in school? -My thesis was on deconstructing the myth of the muse and the erasure of female artists. -Oh. -What's the longest relationship you've ever been in? -A year. What about you? What was our longest relationship? -Three years. But it felt like a lot longer. -Three years? That sounds kind of serious. - Yeah. - Did it end well? -No. Nope. He wasn't very nice to me. -Oh. Sorry. But, um, what about your family? Are you close with your parents? -They died when I was a kid. -I'm so sorry. I had no idea. -How could you? We're just getting to know each other. -Right. Oh, look at that. Do you want to stop and get some snacks? I could actually really use the bathroom. -Meredith, we're so close. Um, you think you can hold it? I'd love to get to the cabin and get settled in. -Uh, okay. Sure. -You're the best. I love this part. -What part? -The intimacy. It's my favorite part. Wow. This is... -I said it was remote. Don't worry. - I'm not worried. It's just... - What? -It's dark as hell. -Well, yeah. That's just the woods. -Yeah. No kidding. -Well, here we are. This place is really special to me, Meredith. Um, it means a lot that you agreed to come. - Oh. - I'm really looking forward to our time here together. -It's gorgeous. -It is, isn't it? Um, why don't you grab your stuff. I'll go open her up. -Uh, okay. -Leave. -What? -Huh? -That wasn't you? -I didn't say anything. -All right. -Got it. What are you doing? Come in. I'll give you the master tour. Yeah, I know. It's, uh... - Oh. - Rustic. -Uh... -No, this is, um... -It's okay? -Uh, yeah, it's absolutely wonderful. -Yeah? -Yeah. Like, I'm actually swooning. For a cabin. Yeah, it's just... it's perfect. -Good. Oh, my God. What?! -Yeah. The Wrath of the Erinys. It's pretty gruesome, isn't it? I love the drama in it. I... I think they're absolutely terrifying. -Yeah. Yeah, I know. This came through our museum recently to establish provenance. Hellenistic period. I can't believe you have this. It's a really expensive piece. -It's a reproduction, actually. -No. -Yeah. Mm-hmm. -That is a hell of a reproduction. -Yeah. Hey, come on. I'll give you the rest of the tour. -All right. This is where I will be working my magic this evening. -I... I mean... I'm already enchanted. -Well, good. Then I'm ahead of schedule then. This was going to be my backup plan. -Ah. Okay. Red or white? -Right now, I'm thinking... red. -Red it is. -Awesome. So, any other questions? -Yes. Where's your bathroom? -Wow. You look stunning. To art and beauty. -And the night ahead. Um, I brought that record I was telling you about. -Oh, great. Why don't you go put it on? I'll finish prepping this. -Yea... Can I help. -And spoil the surprise? No. You go make yourself at home. -Someone is not a fan of the past. -Everything all right? -Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not crazy, I swear. Not yet. -I'm sorry. Are you okay? -Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I'm just... I just... It's the woods or something. -Oh, you're scared. I... -No, I'm not. I'm... -Come inside. Dinner's ready. -Okay. -There's this great quote from Helen Gough. "People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did. But people were never forget how you made them feel." And I think that's why I was drawn to Yotam Ottolenghi's approach to cooking, because you get a real sense of history in each dish and, uh, your place in that history, you know? Mer? -Hm? Sorry. -We don't have to talk about my cooking, but it'd be nice to talk at least. What were you thinking about? -Mmm... When did you get this place? -Oh. Came on the market a few years ago. Why? -Have you ever experienced anything weird here before? -Weird? What do you mean? -Like, um, I don't know. Unexplained stuff. Do you not want to be here? -Oh, no. Uh, what? -Then why are you making such a stink about the cabin? -Oh, no, I'm not making a stink. I'm just trying to... I'm just wondering about your experiences here. -Well, I find that my experiences here are usually quite nice, Meredith. And if you just relax, you might feel the same way. -Right. Okay. What about Lenora? Did she ever experience anything? -Who? -Lenora, the woman in your photo. She used to own the place. And no, she never had any problems here. I'm getting some more wine. -I'm sorry, Bruce. Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! - What? - There's someone on your patio. - What? - There's someone on your fucking patio. - I think it's... - What? - It's a woman. - A woman? -Yes. Your motion sensor light turned on, and I saw a woman out there. -I don't have a motion sensor light. -Well... -Did you turn this on yourself? -See? -Are you fucking with me? -Bruce, I know what I saw. - Meredith, what the fuck? - Sorry, sorry, sorry. I thought you couldn't see anything with a light on. Do you see anything? -Just shut up. Just wait one second. Wait one second. It's nothing. -Are you sure? -Yeah. You're just imagining things. You're just imagining things. -Sorry. I just... I know. -There. Now the light won't freak you out anymore. -Maybe we should just go back to the city. -What do you mean? -We can still spend the weekend together. We just do it at one of our apartments. -No, Meredith. We just got here. I just cooked you an entire meal that you barely touched. And I really don't feel like driving back to the city. Let's just relax, have another glass of wine. - Okay. I can't. - We're fine. - I can't. - It's fine. - No, it's not. - It was just a bat. A bat hit the window. Okay? It's an old cabin. Okay? We're in the woods. We're completely alone out here. -Yeah, no, I know. That's the problem. -What? You don't want to be here alone with me? -No. I... no, I mean, yes. -You're scared? -Yeah. I'm scared. Will you check what that was, please? -Fine. But I think you're being over-dramatic. -Okay, so, Bruce, I'm not comfortable staying here tonight. Either you drive me home right now, or I'm just going to call the ride share. -Fine. -Good. - Hey. - Get the hell out of there. -What? -Okay. Okay. It's time. -That statuette was stolen. -When? -A few months after we certified it, the night it went up for auction. The police are still investigating. -Okay. I already told him that we're leaving, so I'll just... -Mer? You ready? -I'm just using the toilet before the long drive. I'll be right out. Did you hear me? I'll be just a sec. -There's something else you should know, Meredith. Something bad. The woman who bought the sculpture is missing, too. Okay, um... um, um... I'm going to text you from the car. -So should we hit the road? Ah! I lied in the car earlier. This is my favorite part. -Whatcha doing? Whatcha doing, Bruce? -Basking. -Basking? -Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm basking in the morning light. I'm a basker. -I think you're just ignoring me. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. -I had another dream last night. -Tell me. -There was this black and white checkered floor all around me, and I knew if I stepped on a black square, I'd fall through forever. So I was trying to keep my feet on the white squares. But then I realized there were no white squares. -Weird. "Enter the Chorus of Furies, questing like hounds." -What? -"Ho! Clear is here the trace of him we seek. Follow the track of blood, the silent sign." -What are you saying? -All your secrets are escaping. Ah. Ah! No. Oh, no. Oh. Okay. You got this. You got this. You got this. You got this. Oh. Oh. Mer? Ah! -Bruce! -Mer? -What have you done? -Ah! -Fuck. What the fuck?! What are you doing? Ah! -Murderer! Thief! Murderer! Thief! -Fuck! I'm seeing things. Shut up. No. It's real. Shut up! Mount Superior has transformed into flesh without flesh. To dwell among us. -Oh. Oh. You sneaky... -Why are you here? Hmm? Vengeance? You want to wring remorse from my body like a wet rag? Punish and torment me with nightmares for the crimes I've committed? -Because you will get nothing from me, demon. There are no nightmares you can show me that will compare to the ones I've been seeing my entire life. -I understand your anger. But I won't change a thing. -We'll see. -What the fuck?! -Oh, God! -Don't you fucking laugh at me! -Ah! -Ah! Is this what you want? Here. Here. Take it. Here. You can have it. You can have it. Despite what you've seen, I'm not a savage. I don't wanna hurt anyone. I want people to be happy. I want them to be happy with me. But... there's a piece floating inside of my head. It's not... It's not who I am. It's not even a part of me. But it takes control sometimes. When I see something, uh, beautiful, this piece... wants it. Call me weak, call me damaged, call me broken. But you got to believe me. I try to fight the impulse. And I regret it every time I lose. If returning this will make things right, please take it. Here. Please take it. Please take it. Come on. Good. It's over. It's over. I won't let it happen again. I won't let it happen again. I won't let it. I won't let it. I won't let it. I won't let it. I won't let it. I won't let it happen again. I won't let it happen again. Believe... Believe what I say. Believe... Believe what I say. Believe in the words that I say. The things that I say. Believe, truth in the night. The words are alive. The night is alive. But the day doesn't know that the words that are said can't be taken back. No! -What? -Bruce? Bruce. Can you hear me? Nod if you can hear me. Good. Can you speak? I asked, can you speak, Bruce? -Yes. -Very good. If you truly want to make things right, we're going to have a conversation. I'm going to ask you some questions and you have to answer truthfully. Why did you pick me? -Picked you? -Yes. Why did you ask me out? -I didn't. -What does that mean? -I don't choose. He does. -The floating piece inside you decides who you're going to kill? Yeah. Exactly. -How many women have there been? -Oh, I don't know. A few. -Who's buried in the woods? Kate and Leonora. This is a new collection. -Did you know you were going to kill me when you invited me here? -No. I was never planning on killing you, Meredith. He was. I tried to stop him. I always do. But he's too strong. It's nothing personal. -So there's nothing I could have done differently? If it wasn't me, it would have been someone else. -Yes. But you're very beautiful. -That always catches his attention. - Which one of you kissed me? - Sorry? -Which one of you kissed me? Was it him or was it you? -Me. He can't be intimate. -So, you also find me attractive. -Oh, yes. Meredith, you're stunning. -And unlike him, you can act on those feelings. -Somewhat. -Who saw me first? -I don't remember. -You don't remember if you saw me first and he had to call you off so he could kill me, of if he's the one who pointed me out to you in the first place? -No. It doesn't work like that. You don't understand. -No. I can't imagine that I would. Help me understand, Bruce. Dig deeper. Show me the piece that's floating inside you. Dig it out. This will be cathartic. -Will it help purify me? -No, Bruce, you're fucked. This will be cathartic for me. -Fuck. No. You tricked me! Ooh. -Ho! Clear is here the trace of him we seek. -Follow the tracks of blood, the silent sign! -Ah! -Murderer! Thief! Murderer! Thief! -Like to some hound that hunts a wounded fawn... -Murderer! Thief! -We snuff along the scent of dripping gore. -And inwardly we pant, for many a day, toiling in chase that shall fordo the man. -Murderer! Thief! -Murderer! Thief. -Murderer. Thief. - Murderer! Thief! - No! -Murderer! Thief! Murderer! Thief! Murderer! Thief! - Murderer! Thief! - Thief! - No! - Thief! -That's right. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. -I won't let it. I won't let it happen again. I won't... - Believe what I say. Believe in what I say, the words that I say. -What?! What do you want?! -The truth in the night. The words are alive. The night is alive. -But the day doesn't know. -Follow, seek him, round and round. -Scent, snuff, scan the ground, lest unharmed he slip away. The words that I've said can't be taken back. -What do you want?! Of course. Oh, this is the perfect place. I'm ready. I'm ready! Where are you?! Where... Thank you. -You don't understand gratitude, Bruce. You're a thief. You rob women of their power and their beauty and their lives because you hate that you have none of those things. -I knew you'd understand me. You flushed the red owl out. You saved us both. -It's over. -What? No. We're just beginning. The sun is coming out. The darkness is gone. -I want you to say it. -What do you want me to say? -"I'm a murderer. I'm a thief." -What? No. -Admit it. You're a murderer and a thief. -No! It was him! -Bruce, There's still a lot of darkness inside you, and I can see it. It's right there. -It's not fair! It's not fair! Oh. Oh! Cut him off, please! -Say it! "I'm a murderer. I'm a thief." -Cut him off! Cut him off! It's not who I am! No! Ah! No! Cut him off, please! Ah! Promise... Cut him off, please! Please! No, God! Cut him off, pl... Please! Please, help me! Meredith! -Go fuck yourself. -Meredith!
