(film reel clicking) (slow dramatic music) (slow music) - Thanks for coming out. Today I'm happy to inform you that overnight Operation Red Foot took down a human trafficking ring that resulted in eight arrests. Now I can't go into any more detail at the moment, but I can assure you that the operation was a success and that we are committed to decreasing crime in our city. - Mayor Hamilton. How do you respond to reports that your office wouldn't have become aware of the trafficking if not for the series of leaks? - I can assure you that our police are well aware and on top of crime. Information being leaked to the media does not do any good. In fact, it can actually jeopardize or harm a case. - But Operation Red Foot wasn't launched until after these files were leaked. - Let me be clear. All statistics show that crime is down under our new commissioner. People should report crime to the police and not take the law into their own hands. - Are there any links to the killing of two gang members last week? - Absolutely not. Let me be very clear. Anyone caught committing murder or crime will be hunted down and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Thank you. And now I'll hand you over to Commissioner Carlin. Commissioner Carlin. (slow dramatic music) (chair rattling) (men grunting) - [Man] Fuck you. Fuck you. (men grunting) (fire crackling) (insects chirping) (car engine rumbling) (slow music) (camera clicking) (car engine rumbling) - What are you doing here? So what? This is a gated community. You need permission to be here. - Fine. (car engine rumbling) - Let me take another look at that. - I'm leaving. (birds chirping) (door knocking) - Shae, come in, come in. Would you like a drink? - I'm good. - What have you got for me? Ah. Ah, I knew it. Ran away, my ass. You know, you invest time and energy into something and they run off with your best friends. What's the world coming to? - Are you sure they're your dogs? - Mm. Okay then, here you go. You're not curious? - About? - Anything. - You asked me to find your dogs. - I did. And you did. You know, occasionally I may have a need for security personnel. Are you interested in any extra work? - I just find people and dogs. - Come on, with your skills you could make some serious money. - You lose another dog, let me know. - (laughs) I will. (slow music) (buttons beeping) (door knocking) (door knocking) - Dad. - I've been trying to call. Your phone, disconnected again? - [Shae] It's just flat. - Been keeping busy? - [Shae] Uh-huh. (bottles clinking) - You know, if you need money, you can always come and ask. - [Shae] I said I'm good. - I'm just saying, the offer stands. - I'm good. - You know, you need to start thinking of yourself. You can't keep sending her all your money. You need to be smart. - Is this really what you came to talk about? - No, I came to give you this. - Thanks. - Hey, what happened to you? You had a good career. You were going places. This self-destructive attitude- - Are we really doing this again? - No, I've done what I came to do. Okay. (birds chirping) - [Woman] Excuse me, are you Shae? - Yeah. - I'm sorry to ambush you like this. I'm wondering if I can speak with you. - Look, I'm in a rush, okay? - It won't take long. I need you to find my missing daughter. - If she's missing, you need to contact the police. - We did. They won't help. Look, she's run away before and they think it's the same. But she's never been gone this long. - Look, if she has run away, honestly, the police are your best option. - A friend recommended you, said that you tracked down his sister, said that you were with the police and now- - She's run away before? Then I'm sure she'll come back, okay? Look, I'm sorry, I'm in a rush. - Look, I can pay you. My husband said, look, money's not an issue. In case you change your mind. Amelia. I'm Amelia. - Do you think you've gotten value out of these sessions? I know you're not paying for them, but is there really nothing you want to talk about? This is our final meeting. I met your father once, you know. - I'm sorry. - The classic old school cop. (Shae scoffing) What? - Old school. People say that like it's some kind of badge of honor. - You don't think he was a good cop? He retired with full commendations and is well-respected. How is your relationship with your father? I imagine it must have been difficult for a tough cop to see his daughter dragged through the mud. And after all that, these assault charges. - Why you asking about him? - Just trying to start a conversation. I'll need to submit a report. And so far, all we've spoken about is what kinds of music you don't like. - You know what, okay, something for your report. I have anger issues, which I'm working on. I drink, I don't look after myself. I have very few friends left. And my greatest achievement to date is being the daughter of an old school cop. - Your father's never done anything for you? - He taught me to hunt. - We're not all the enemy, you know? - (sighs) See, this is why I don't talk. - Shae, you're here because it's part of your conditions. Therapy- - Look, do I really need to stay for the rest? - You're free to go. (slow music) - Mum. Mum, you okay? - Shae, what are you doing here? - I came to see how you are. - I'm fine. - I thought maybe I could make you breakfast or lunch. - I don't want any breakfast. - How's Aunt Emma? - She's fine. Don't know how she puts up with those kids of hers. No good money-grubbing little shits. - Mum, what are these? - Oh, don't worry about them. - I send you money. - Oh, leave it. You sound just like your father. - Oh, just like Dad? Mum, I send you money so you can pay your bills, not drink yourself to an early grave. - I'm doing all right. I've got a roof over my head, ain't I? (door knocking) (Janet coughing) - Oh, is Janet in? - Sorry, she's... Can I help you? - This is Jeremy. He's from the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. - And? - You're Janet's daughter. - Miss Conway, this is an eviction notice. - What? I transferred money yesterday. This can't be right. - Is Janet in? I need to serve that to her. - Listen, just, here, take it, please. Just until I can get it figured out, please. - [Jeremy] You can take it up with the real estate agent. I'm just the messenger. - What's going on? Evicted? You can't do that. It says I'm behind on my rent. - Ms. Conway, you have four weeks- - [Janet] Oh, you bastards. - Mum. I'm sorry, I just... - Oh, they can't do this. - Yes they can, Mum. It says it right fucking there. - I thought you paid up. What happened? 28 days, they can't do this. What? Don't judge me. You don't know what I went through with your father. (slow dramatic music) He's a mean, hateful man and he never did nothing for me. (Shae screaming) (phone ringing) - [Man] Ball Realty. - Hi, this is Shea Conway. I'm calling about Janet Conway's rental. - Janet Conway? - She's my mother. - [Man] Conway. Do you mind holding while I put you through to the property manager? - Come on, guys. (bird squawking) - [Man] Hello, Miss Conway. - Yeah, I'm here. - [Man] Yeah, I'm sorry. I tried your mother this morning but I couldn't get ahold of her. We've been notified by the bank that she's behind on her rent and the situation's escalated. - Well, isn't there something you can do? I mean, this can't be normal. - [Man] It is unusual, but this isn't the first time that we've issued a breach notice. The owner has a mortgage to pay and the bank has made a ruling. - Okay, well what if I spoke to the owner? - I'm sorry, I can't give out their details. (slow music) - Look, she's going to lose her house. - [Man] She needs to go before a tribunal. In the meantime, the real estate will need to relist the apartment. Hello? (footsteps thudding) - So you said your daughter's missing? - She's been gone five days. - And she's run away before? - She's a teenager. She's moody and she thinks she's some sort of tortured victim. She's run away before, but she's always come back after a day or two. But this time we got this. - And you showed this to the police? - They said it looked like something a teenage girl would make. Too much bad television. - Would she do this? I mean, this is a pretty serious prank to play. - We don't know anymore. She keeps acting out and look, we're at our wits' end. - What about her friends? - [Amelia] Well, she doesn't have many, but we've called around and none have seen or heard from her. - Is there anywhere else she'd go? Does she have a job? - Well, she had one. Lasted one shift. We, I thought she needed some independence, you know, learn how the world really works. She stole a pack of cigarettes and got fired. - She's not a bad child. I think she's just fallen in with a bad crowd. - Did the police say anything else? - (scoffs) Useless. They took some notes and filled out a report and said they'd look into it. And you know what that means. - Look, in all likelihood, she's going to turn up by herself in a day or two. The police will follow it up. There's not much I can do. - But it couldn't hurt, right? To have someone who is actually looking? Besides, there are people who might open up to you who won't to talk to the police? - [Amelia] Yeah, I mean, if it's money, we can- - It's not that. - Okay, this is Max. They girl next to her is Danny. Danny went missing a few months ago and her parents still haven't heard anything. And I'm worried. There was a fire near where the kids hang out and there's talk of an arsonist. And some of us are really worried this person's going- - People are scared. Plus there's this. - Can I see her room? - Sure. - Yeah. - Did you clean up? - This is all her. She's always been very neat. - [Shae] Tell me about her friends. - Danny was her best friend. They've known each other all their lives. Ian went to school with her parents. So we've always stayed close. - Anyone else? - Oh, she started hanging out some other kids, but we don't know them. - After Danny, Max withdrew. Her and Syd are still close, but she won't open up to us. - Syd? - Sydney, her younger sister. - Is she here? - Ah no, she's out at a friend's. - May I? - Yes. It's password protected though. - Look, I have to ask, why me? I mean, there's plenty of investigators who specialize in this sort of thing. I just, I find missing pets, cheating partners. - You were recommended. Barry Hall, he said you tracked down his sister. - Look, it's $5,000. You'll get as much again when we get her back. - We just want her found. We can pay you more if you need. - No, no, it's, it's... All right, I'll look into it. Can I take this? - Oh, yes. - Thank you. Now please just let us know as soon as you find anything, yeah? - I can't promise anything. - Oh, we'll just be happy knowing we've done everything we can. - [Amelia] Shae, do you think that firebug is a threat? - Why bring that up again? - It's okay. Honestly, that sounds like insurance fraud to me. But I'll look into it. - [Ian] Thank you. (slow music) - Hey, um, are you free? (upbeat rock music) (people talking) - It's great to see ya. It's been weeks. What have you been doing? - Oh, you know, a bit of this, a bit of that. Paying bills. - Whose bills are you paying now? Have you ordered? Should we eat? - Oh, nothing for me. - Suit yourself. - Ready to order? - Yes, big breakfast, extra bacon, thanks. - The usual? - I'm good. - Great. - Big breakfast? It's four in the afternoon. - Says the person drinking a beer. Besides, (sighs) I need my bacon. So, what's up? - I need you to get into this laptop. It's for a case, missing girl. Her parents don't know the password. - Missing girl? - Runaway, most likely, but the parents want to cover all the bases. There was another thing. There's this as well. - "I have Max." It's not exactly a ransom letter. - The thing is, I think even Max's dad thinks she made this. Her mum, on the other hand, she's got it in her head that Max is going to die in a building fire. - There have been a few fires lately but I haven't heard of any fatalities though. - There was another girl, Danny. It's one of Max's friends. And she went missing a few months ago. - Two missing girls? You think there's a connection? - I don't know, the whole thing's just odd. - Full name? - Max Cartwright. - Doesn't ring a bell. Did they report it? - She's run away before. Apparently the police won't do anything. - Kids these days, right? Mm. Okay, done. - Geez, it's not much to go on. - How are you, Kyle? Yeah, I'm good. Jess is great. She's due in June. Thanks for asking. - Sorry. - (sighs) It's fine. You know, you should come around for dinner one night. Shae, you can't keep avoiding her. She doesn't blame you for anything. - You almost lost your job because of me. - But I didn't. I'm sergeant now. We're expecting. Things are good for us. Missing persons though, this is a good move for you. - Yeah. So what can you tell me about this firebug? - What's to tell? Insurance job most likely. You're leaving? - Yeah, look, I've to um... - It's all good. - Thanks, man. - Until next time. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I speak to someone about Janet Conway's rental? - Oh, yeah, I'll just go see if Gary's in the back. If you just want to take a seat down there. - Ms. Conway. - Shae. - You wanted to talk? - Look...here's $5,000. That'll cover the rent, the back pay, whatever. - Look, I don't even know if that's going to be enough to cover it. Look, there are multiple infringements over years. - Look, I have the money, okay? Surely you can just take it. Just don't kick her out, please. - Lucy. Look, what I can do is I can hold onto this. Look, I've got to call the bank and the owner. Now it is completely up to them. Now, if they agree, then we'll deposit this first thing in the morning, okay? - All right, thank you. - Look, Shae, I'm concerned that in a couple of months we're going to be doing this all over again. And I know the homeowner feels the same. - Look, I'm getting it sorted, okay? - [Gary] Mm. - And I'll pay you directly from now on. (slow music) (phone ringing) - Kyle? - Shea. - What's up? - Earlier on, you mentioned an arsonist. - [Shae] Yeah. - Well, in the past three weeks, two abandoned buildings have been burnt down. It's now a murder investigation. - What, they only just found a body? - That's all the information I have. I just, I thought I would let you know. If this is connected to your missing girl, you may be looking for a murderer. Be careful. - Thanks. (birds chirping) Dominic Cooper? - Yes. Can I help you? - My name's Shae Conway. I'm investigating the disappearance of Max Cartwright. - Max is missing? - She's been to class? - Ah, no. She doesn't always attend. She's here maybe once or twice a week if you're lucky. - [Shae] What can you tell me about her? - She's a teenage girl. Doesn't really have a lot of direction. - And when was the last time she came to class? - Maybe last week. I'd have to check. To be honest though, I've given up on keeping track. - Was her friend Danny in your class? - She was. Before Danny went missing, the two of them were inseparable. - Any other friends? - Not really. It was usually just those two. - Mm. Do you know where this is? - Actually, the girl in the background, Sophie. I've seen her and Max talk a few times. - Is she in today? - I saw her this morning, but she usually ditches after lunch. - (sighs) Does anyone actually come to class? - Most are from well-off families. They don't think they need good grades. If you don't mind, who hired you? - Max's parents. What? You seem surprised. - Well, I doubt they'll win Parents of the Year. I don't remember ever seeing them at a parent-teacher evening. But they are donors to the school. - Okay, well, thanks. And if you think of anything just, yeah. - You don't think something's actually happened to her, do you? Hey. In case you need anything else. These are good kids, but many of them are lost. I hope you find her. - Hi, I was wondering if you could tell me if this girl's in today, Sophie? - Oh, Sophie Taylor. Oh, she checked in this morning. She's in class right now. If it's not urgent, you'll have to wait till lunch. - Yeah, that's fine. (Shae sighing) (birds chirping) (bell ringing) (slow music) (people talking) - You right? - You're Sophie, right? - Who are you? - I'm Shae. I'm looking for a girl you know, Max. - Are you some kind of perv? - Max's parents hired me to find her. - Yeah, right. - (sighs) She's not in trouble or anything. Do you know where this is? - That's just a hangout place you go to get drunk, and high, and stuff. - [Shae] Does Max do drugs? - Look, I haven't seen Max in about a week. She always talked about running away. I guess I hope she finally did. - What do you mean? - Max isn't really the type of person to open up. The only reason stuck around here for so long is 'cause of her little sister. - Who's your friend, Sophie? - I'm Becky. Nice board. - Where are you doing here, Becky? (slow dramatic music) - I was just leaving. - Don't go. - Try it. Beat it! Shit. (phone ringing) Mum. - [Janet] They're going to evict me. - Yeah, Mum, I know. - [Janet] They want to kick me out. - I'm sorting it out, okay? I'm fixing it. - [Janet] You don't want to come around anymore. (mumbles) I don't know what to do. - Yeah, Mum. (slow music) (traffic rumbling) (dog barking) (distant siren wailing) - Are you following me? Is that supposed to mean something? - [Shae] What, you didn't leave this on my car? - No. Why would I? - Shit. - What does it say? The warehouse. It's a place you go if you're desperate. - Desperate? - Like if you really need money or something, I don't go there. - Do you think Max could have gone there? - I wouldn't have thought so. I hope not. - Just tell me what happens there. - I don't know. I knew a girl who got taken there once. She didn't say what happened to her, but she got beaten pretty bad. - Where is it? - Look, all I know is it's near the river. I've told you all I know. - Shit. - [Shae] Relax, I come in peace. - What do you want? - I'm looking for a girl. Max. (slow dramatic music) - What business have you got with Max? - Listen, I just want to make sure she's okay. What about here friend, Danny? - And what do you care about them? - Honestly, I don't. But I've been paid to find Max, so if she's here, just let me talk to her, okay? And then I'll be on my merry way. - Look, she's not here, all right? Danny's been gone for ages and I haven't seen Max for days. - Shit. - So you're really just trying to find Max? - Yeah. Why? - Look, I don't know. I guess I thought you might've been one of those pervs or something. I don't- - Pervs? - Hey, bro. - Whoa. - Shit. - It's all good, bro. She's just looking for Max. - I'm not a perv. - Could have fooled me. - What can you tell me about the warehouse? - I mean, if things get real bad you can make a bit extra money there I guess. - You got to eat, right? You need money to eat. Perverts come around thinking they can take advantage. But you go there if you really need money. - Anything else? - I don't know. Go check it out if you want. Down by the river, a bunch of graffiti. You'd fit right in. Fuckin' freak. (people yelling) (slow music) - Shit. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. I'm going to get you out of here, okay? You're okay. - [Woman] Hold it. Step away from her. Hands up. Don't turn around. You're going to toss the gun and tell me what the hell you're doing here. - I'm looking for someone. - [Woman] Toss it. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (woman grunting) (woman groaning) - [Man] Don't do anything stupid. (woman groaning) - Freeze! Drop it. I said drop it. - [Man] What did I just say? (Shae screaming) (both grunting) (gun firing) (Shae screaming) (woman groaning) - Shit. (slow dramatic music) Shit. Hey, you're okay. You're all right. Yeah, I need an ambulance. (sirens wailing) (traffic rumbling) - You okay? - It's not Max or Danny. Geez, how many girls are fucking missing? - She's going to be all right. We're working on her identity, but for now you saved her life. Now you said there were two others here? - Yeah, one was wearing a hoodie. Got the drop on me. And then the other one showed up. - Are you sure they're not working together? - If this is our arsonist, Shae, there could be a chance there's more than one. - Look, I don't know, okay? None of this makes sense. - [Kyle] Are you sure you're all right? - When did the arsonist case get made? - What do you mean? I only found out about it last night right before I called you. - Right after I start looking for Max? - What's your point? Shit. Just keep quiet. - Quite the mess. - Forensics are going over the scene now, boss. They should be able to get DNA from the blood. - What, you shot the suspect? - No, they shot at each other. - Each other? I was told there's only one suspect. - [Shae] Well, there's two. - [Joe] And did you get a look at either of them? - One had a hoodie, the other had a balaclava. - Given your statement? - She has, boss. We're searching the area as we speak. - Mm-hm. Are you still in therapy? - Piece of shit. - He's not worth it. - He couldn't care less about the other girls, just as long as he can keep claiming that crime is down. - Shae, relax, you did good. - What the fuck did I even do? (slow music) (birds chirping) - Oh, you got my message. - I did. About last night. I managed to track down one girl, but it wasn't Max. - What? No. - Shae, Max is home. She came back this morning. - That's what I called you about. - She's here? - Yeah, had us pick her up from the train station. - Do you think I could talk to her? - I'm not sure that's a good idea. She's sleeping now. - We heard about last night. It's all over the news. Just didn't realize you were there. - Oh, it's... - Here. - Well, I can't take this. I didn't find her. - Max is back. - And you saved another girl. You've earnt it. - Please, we want you to have it. - Thank you, really. We just want to put this as far behind us as we can. (slow music) - Ms. Conway. Ms. Conway. Ms. Conway. I'm glad I caught you. I was just on my way up to see your mother. - Why, what's happened? - I've just had a call from her real estate. Her rent's all paid up. Must have been an issue on their side or something, - Wait. So the eviction notice, it's gone? - It is. And she's all paid up for the next three months. So I thought you might like to tell her yourself. - Yeah, thanks. - Say hi to her. - [Janet] Sweetie. - What's all this? - I'm celebrating. - Oh? - I won $300 on keno. (laughs) Would you like some? - I'm good? - Me and Anna were playing the machines and then we decided to do some keno and pow. Technically we won $600, but we split it. Talk about good luck. - I just passed your manager downstairs. - That bastard. What does he want? Toss me out in the street next week? - Actually he said not to worry about the eviction notice. There was some kind of mix up with the real estate. It's all good. - Mix up? Those pieces of shit. (phone ringing) - Dad, what's up? - [Dad] Hey, I just called to say well done. - For? - [Dad] I spoke to one of my buddies still on the force. He said you saved some girl. They've added kidnapping to their arson investigation. - Look, Dad, I really didn't do anything. I was in the right place, right time. - [Dad] Shae, that's not how you play this. If I talk to some people, there's a chance you could get back on the force. - I don't want to be back on the force, Dad. - [Dad] Sweetie, this is a good thing. - Dad, can you just listen to me for one second? - [Dad] Fine, it's always the same. (phone dinging) - Look, Dad, I've got to go. (Shae sighing) (slow music) (insects chirping) Oh, I'm good, thanks. - Righty-o, get ready for the best roast of your life. (sighs) An old family recipe. - I've had your roast before. - Really? Well you get to experience it again. - So Shae, Kyle tells me you're quite the hero. - I wouldn't say that. - Well, saving someone's life, I'd call you a hero. - Ladies, look, that is enough shop talk at the table. Besides, who wants chicken? - Give me all the chicken. I eating for two, remember? - You always eat for two. That's why I cook for three on a regular night. (laughs) Oh, snap. Oh, delicious. (sighs) She's out cold. - This was good. Thanks for the invite. - Thanks for finally coming over. - Yeah. - What is it? I know that look. - It's the missing girl. - I thought she returned home. - No, not her. The one from last night. - [Kyle] (sighs) Let it go. - I can't, it doesn't makes sense. - She's safe. Soon we'll find out who she is and hopefully she can return home. I bet there's some frantic parents out there. - But it's weird though, right? I mean, someone leaves a note on my car which leads me to some warehouse, and just happens to have a girl in it. Not to mention the two people shooting at each other. Come on. - It is strange, I'll give you that. But I dunno what to tell you. - Well, what about the security footage? I mean, surely that picked up something. I chased one of those guys down to the street. What? - There's no footage. None of the security cameras within two block radius of that building work. - Are you serious? - Apparently city budget cuts. (Shae sighing) You're leaving? - Yeah, thanks for dinner and everything. - Shae. - Yeah? - Don't do anything stupid. - Who, me? - Promise me. - I won't do anything, stupid. (slow dramatic music) - Who the fuck are you? - I'm an investigator. I'm looking for a missing girl. You should get that looked at. - Ah! (gun clicking) Oh, bitch. (woman groaning) The girl, is she all right? - Well that one is. I was looking for somebody else. All right, my turn. Who are you? - I'm an idiot. - Fuck, you should really get that looked at. - [Woman] I can't exactly go to a hospital. - Fuck's sake. Come on. - Where are we going? - I know a place. - You really searching for a missing girl? - [Shae] I was until she reappeared out of thin air - Turn right up here. - You need to get that arm looked at. - Turn. - So where are we? - Go and look over the edge, the big house down to the right. Take your camera. - Don't touch my shit. (camera clicking) Hey, whose house is that? What's going on? - Get in, I'll tell you. - You tell me now. - Away from here. (drone buzzing) Get in. - Get her to take these. They should prevent infection. What have you gotten yourself into? - I don't know. You should go. I don't want to cause you any trouble. - Take it. I owe you. I'll get rid of your car. You don't have to worry. - How's Kelly? - Doing better. She wakes sometimes and doesn't know where she is. But, uh... she made a friend at school, that's a start. - Thanks. (slow music) (people talking) - Another? - Oh, I can't. It's a school night. - I won't tell if you don't. (woman laughing) - [Bartender] Another round? - Please. - Batting a bit above your average, eh? - She's my personal psychic. I take her everywhere. - Psychic? - Yeah, you won't believe how useful they can be. - How so? - She once told me that I would meet the woman of my dreams hidden safely behind a marble barricade. (phone buzzing) This is Brian. (slow dramatic music) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) - Dad. - [Brian] Shae, what the hell is going on? - Dad, just listen to me. I don't know what's going on. - Stop talking. Good, you need to come in right away. Look, whatever's going on, we can get through this. - [Shae] Dad, you have to listen to me, okay? I've found- - I'm listening. You need to come in right away. You can tell us everything. - Us? What do you mean, us? Come in where? - Shae, just come in. Shae. - Hey. - What? - [Shae] We have to go. - Shit. You should toss that. - I need to know what's going on. Tell me! - That house, they take girls there, as young as five. They auction them off. Have parties. They call it the mansion. - The guy who hired me, he was there last night. Why would he hire me to find his own daughter? - My guess, they used you to lure me out. I got a call yesterday that there was someone snooping around the skate park. I followed you to the warehouse. I thought you were one of them. - And who the hell are you? - I'm Riley. - Okay, Riley. Why would they use me to get to you? - Because I'm hunting them. I should've known they'd hunt back. - You're the arsonist? - Arsonist? I burnt down one of their buildings. They were using it to drug girls and transport them to wherever the party's at. - I'm Shae. - Nice to meet you, Shae. We should go. - We need to find somewhere safe. - I know somewhere. (car engine rumbling) (slow music) (birds chirping) Wait here. - Riley says you need a place to lay low for awhile. I'm Ray. - Rescues. Ray's team goes out and finds vulnerable kids. If they're willing, they bring 'em back here. - Does it help them move on? - Sometimes. Some have been through some serious shit. Takes time. - Come with me. I'll show you the cabins. Make yourself at home. Riley, we need to talk. (slow music) - Danny? It's okay. My name's Shae. Can I sit? - You know me? - I was looking for your friend Max. - Did something happen to her? - She's fine. She went back home before I could find her. - She has a sister. I tried to get her to come with me, but that's why she keeps going back. - Well, her parents hired me to find her and- - They don't care about either of them. They're pieces of shit. - Look, do you know about a house in the hills, has a lot of palm trees? (slow dramatic music) - The mansion. That's one of the places they used to take us. They have parties. Full moon's the worst. It has a basement. - We can stay. Don't have another phone on you, do you? - [Shae] No. - Good. Come on. - (sighs) Look, we need to contact the police. We need to tell them what's going on. - What? - Look, I know someone, someone I trust. - Even if you can trust them, you'll only put them in danger. - All right, we'll go to the news. (Riley laughing) What? - You don't know these people. We go to the news, the story gets buried, and we die. And you put anyone close to you at risk. - All right, well then we'll put it on the internet. I mean, this shit will spread. - [Riley] These people have money, they have reach. - Well, what do you suggest then? You just want to hang about here? - No. We hunt them down and we kill them. It's the only way. - No, it makes us no better than them. - Killing rapists and child molesters, I'd say they don't deserve to live. - I've got my camera. I can- - Look, you don't get it. I was a reporter. I spent over a year investigating this. I wrote the article. I had sources and evidence. They buried it. When I posted it online anyway, they fired me. The best that came from it was a brothel got closed down. Then it just went back to business as usual. I couldn't push any harder. My family were at risk. - So you just kill them? - Yep. One less piece of shit to worry about. I don't expect you to understand. (slow music) (birds chirping) - Have you settled in? - Yeah, thanks. How many girls are here? - Right now maybe 15. Sometimes there's more, unfortunately. - And they've all been abused? - Some have. Some grew up on the street, mixed up with drugs or worse. - And how's Riley involved? - Yeah, you'll have to ask her about that. - Well, what can you tell me? - Oh, maybe a year ago she was hanging out with some street kids. And one of our team found her and brought her here. - Anything else? - Oh, anything else doesn't really matter to us. Hey, excuse me. (slow music) Just check out the back. So, your friend left. - Looks like it. - You're not going after her? That look she's got, same as yours was. She won't stop, man, even if it kills her. - She's not my problem. She's old enough to make her own choices. - Do that yourself, did you? (slow music) (people talking) (door creaking) - [Shae] Max. - What do you want? You were at my house. - Your parents hired me to find you, okay? - Find me? They took me. - Look, Max, I can help you, okay? Let me help you. - You stay away from us. - I spoke to Danny. - What? - I can take you to her. I can get you out of here. - I can't. I can't leave Syd. - Let's just tell the principal. - The library's named after my parents. Here comes Max with another crazy accusation again. - Okay, I'll grab Syd and I will come back here for you, okay? - You don't think I haven't tried? I've taken her before. They don't care if I go, but they'll come after Syd. - You said your parents took you? They told me you'd run away. - I was at the mansion. (door squeaking) - Max. Max. Max. - Just stay away from us. (dramatic music) (fist thudding) - Who are you? (fist thudding) (slow music) (Shae breathing heavily) - Check the area, make sure she's alone. Shae, isn't it? I hear you were a good cop once. Not a very smart one though. I'm curious, why not just let it go? We had big plans for you. Tell me, who's the firebug? Who's been causing all these headaches? A lot of work's gone into flushing them out. - I don't know. How would I? - My people want to talk to her. Plus I hold it personally when I get shot at. (gun firing) (Shae screaming) (Shae grunting) Oh shush, it's barely a flesh wound. The next one, on the other hand. - Oh, fuck you. - Someone else then. (gun firing) (car engine rumbling) (slow music) He'll bleed out soon. Someone you do care about then? How about we pay a visit to your mother or your father? Or Kyle's pregnant wife? (gun firing) (dramatic music) (fist thudding) (Shae grunting) (slow music) - I'm sorry, oh my god, I'm so sorry, okay? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. You'll be all right, okay? (Kyle grunting) Come on, we have to go. (Kyle groaning) - [Riley] What the fuck were you thinking? - I thought I- - Thought what? I told you that you can't bring them to justice. They're too powerful. - Well I streamed it. It's all online. - [Riley] It's already been taken down. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. He needs a hospital. (Shae breathing heavily) (Shae grunting) - I couldn't get close. There was at least two cars down the street. I'd say she'll be all right. Your parents too, so long as we stay away. - I did this. Put them all in danger. Who are these people? - The rich and powerful. - Even the rich can't get away with this. - You're not that naive. You were a cop, right? And why aren't you a cop anymore? - I was fired. Found out one of my superiors was on the take. I reported him. - And then what? - Then he became commissioner. They all told me, told me to be smart and keep my mouth shut, and I couldn't do that. - And do you still think we can bring them to justice? For argument's sake, let's say we managed to get enough media attention that no one can ignore. At best one or two people become the fall guys. Nothing will change. The public will be outraged for a few days and then they'll just find the next story to follow. Told you about my story. (slow music) Well, after it was buried, I tracked down one of them and made him confess. I didn't know what I was doing and... went too far. He died. I made him confess. I was so sure it would mean something. Nope. Turns out he really committed suicide and the confession vanished. You have to be clinical, cover every angle. These people won't expose themselves. I was almost killed when I got started, and it was just dumb luck that Ray found me. You can't go it alone. - [Shae] Full moon. - So? - Something Danny said. - The mansion's too well guarded. - I can't sit by knowing what I know. I'm going. (slow suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (man grunting) (Riley grunting) (head thudding) (Shae grunting) (foot thudding) - Hurry, there could be more. (taser buzzing) - What? I'm a PI. (slow music) (slow dramatic music) (Amelia screaming) - What are you doing? Are you crazy? - Stop talking. - Go. There's a car parked down the street. There's instructions in the envelope, go. - What about them? - They can't hurt you anymore. - You are in big trouble. - I said stop talking. - Now if you two want even a chance of living past tonight, you will do exactly as I say. - What do you want? - We're going to a party. - Do anything stupid and I cover the windscreen with your skull. - Tonight's been canceled, sir. The other guests have gone home. - It's okay. Look, I need to speak to Lucas. - Can you just hang on a minute? - There's cameras everywhere. Whatever your plans are, we'd be better off turning around right now. - Shut up. - Okay, you're clear to head up. (taser buzzing) (man groaning) - We should kill them. - No. - Get in. (dramatic music) (slow suspenseful music) (gun firing) (man grunting) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (woman gasping) - Get out of here. Shit, she's getting the guards. Watch my back. - Okay, you're about to have some company. They're coming up on the left. (gun firing) Shit. (gun firing) (gun firing) (slow music) - That's woman's going to bring more. - The basement. There's a basement. (man talking) - It's good, I think it's a new addition. I think it's a great new addition. - [Shae] Don't move! (gun firing) (gun firing) - It appears Ian and Amelia won't be joining us. Pity. - This one I recognize. How are you, Mr. Mayor? - I know this one. I found his missing dog and he didn't even care his partner was cheating. - I seem to recall you not caring about much either. - Let's cut to it. What do you want? - So this is where you do it? This is where you bring them? Don't want anyone to hear their screams? - Riley, check it out. - It's okay. - What is it? (gun firing) (Shea grunting) (gun firing) (men groaning) - What the fuck happened? - Fuck that hurt. Are there any others? - Answer her. - No. Tonight's cancelled thanks to the two of you. (gun firing) - He's getting away. Shea. (slow dramatic music) (insects chirping) (gun firing) Hey. (engine rumbling) - Get the fuck out of the car. Come on, out. Fucking idiot. (partition thudding) - [Shae] Don't fuckin' lose him. (slow music) (dogs barking) (partition thudding) - [Amelia] Let us out. (partition thudding) (dramatic music) (Angelo grunting) (Shae yelling) - Couldn't let it go, could ya? What a fuckin' mess. (both grunting) (Shae breathing heavily) They told me to let you live. I don't know, I think you're too much of a fighter to give up. (Shae yelling) You just wouldn't stop. I had no choice but to kill you. Pick it up. (both grunting) (fist thudding) (Shae grunting) I was just like you once, wanted to make the world a better place. You haven't saved anyone. There's 10 more places like that in this city alone. - Back the fuck away. (Shae groaning) (gun clicking) Shae, get up. Get up, Shae. - [Angelo] Ladies, you're taking everything so personally. Why the hostility? - Come and find out, fucker. (Angelo laughing) (slow dramatic music) (all grunting) (dramatic music) (all grunting) (fist thudding) (both yelling) (both groaning) (both grunting) (Angelo groaning) (Shae grunting) (Riley grunting) (Angelo screaming) (Angelo screaming) (all grunting) (Riley grunting) (slow music) - You think you can make a difference? This life- (gun firing) (slow music) (engine rumbling) - A brutal home invasion gone wrong. A manhunt is underway for the two women accused of murdering the city mayor and his gardener. - If anyone has any information, please contact the police. I just want my husband's killers brought to justice. - Details are still emerging, but the suspects have been identified as Shea Conway and Riley Johnson. A reward has been offered. (birds chirping) - They're doing good. How are you? - Stiff. (sighs) What is it? - It's your friend, Kyle. He's in an induced coma, but he should pull through. His wife is with him and she's fine. - Good. How are my parents? - All I can tell you is that they're alive. The pair of you, on the other hand. You're at the top of the most wanted list. You guys really started some shit out there, eh? Look, don't take this the wrong way, but you can't stay here. - [Shae] So where to? - How about somewhere tropical? Why, what are you thinking? - Angelo said there were more of those places. - And? - And I bet there's other places, other cities, other towns. - What are the chances Max's parents might know something? - Hm. Or that guard. Or the mayor's wife. - Every cop in the country is going to be looking for us. - Hm. Well then, we'll be smart, take our time. (slow music) - It's been six months since the brutal slaying of Mayor Lucas Hamilton. Despite numerous leads and over $1 million in reward money, the suspects have yet to be caught. - If I take off those gags, you're not going to scream, are you? We're here for information. You tell us what we want to know, we'll let you go. - Are you crazy? If we say anything, we're as good as dead. - You're as good as dead if you don't say anything, - We don't know anything. (Ian grunting) (Amelia gasping) (Ian screaming) (Amelia screaming) (Ian screaming) Okay, okay, I'll tell you. - [Shae] Everything. - Everything. The people involved include politicians, judges, and police officers. I can only name the people that I know, but people fly between cities to attend the parties. - (laughs) What now? You think you can change anything? You are nobodies. Release the video. You'll be hunted down and exposed. - No, we're going to hold onto it for a little bit. - [Amelia] Are you going to let us go? - Just one thing bothers me. You know, through your whole confession, you know what never came up? - What? We've told you everything. - You never once asked how your daughters are. (slow dramatic music) (guns firing) (dramatic music)
