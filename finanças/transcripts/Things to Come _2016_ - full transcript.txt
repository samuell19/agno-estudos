- Nathalie! - I'm coming. "Can we put ourselves in the place of the other?" Definitely not easy music to listen to. I wouldn't play it at home. - For sure. You have to see it. - Music in general? - Yes. It's meant to be seen, not just heard. "A great French writer wanted to rest here" "to hear only the sea and wind." "Passerby, respect his last wish." - Can we go? Because the tide's coming in. I don't want to sleep with Chateaubriand. - Wait up. - Coming? - I'll be right there. "THINGS TO COME" "Several years later" Don't answer. It's your mother. - Hello, you've reached Heinz and Nathalie. We're not in, but you can leave a message. - Nathalie? Nathalie, are you there? It's me. I'm in such pain, Nathalie. I can't breathe. - What is it? - I can't breathe. I took a Xanax. - How long ago? - 45 minutes. Can I take another? - Sure, take one now. - It doesn't help. - It'll be fine! - I'll call the firemen. I can't stay like this. - We can't call the firemen for every panic attack. - You can't come? - Now? Are you crazy? See the time? I have to sleep. I get up at 6:00. "The Radical Loser" - If the reform passes, us kids won't find work. Already 25% unemployment! When we finish school, we won't find jobs! - Let's show them we won't give up! - You can't enter! - You can't stop me from working! - Majority rules in democracy! - Let the teacher in. Everyone together! - Unbelievable. Everyone together. Good morning. - Can we have a debate? - A debate? - On the reform. To get your opinion. - I don't have to give my opinion on politics. But blocking the entrance is pathetic. Students deciding if teachers can work? We have to ask freshmen if we can teach now. - They won't let Antonia come in. - Great! I've had enough. - Respect different convictions! - You have none! You just want to graduate! - You're in school and speak of retirement! Enough! - Your talk of '68 is nonsense! You're selfish! - Us, selfish? This isn't for us but for our parents, for workers. For people that work hard all their lives! - For our futures. - And you're not concerned? - I'm not here to talk politics but to teach. - Collaborationist! - You don't mind working until you're 67? - I love my job. I'm in no rush. - Teachers have no lives. - What about people who slave away? - Meaning people like you? - Butt out! - Listen to you! Unbelievable! - Let my students enter. - Let the scabs in! - Open your books. - There's no time for class. - Okay, then. Then consider this quotation of Rousseau's. "If there were a nation of gods, "it would govern itself democratically. "A government so perfect... Is not suited to men." Think it over. Then we'll discuss it. Don't misinterpret it. Remember, Rousseau wrote "The Social Contract," inspiring the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. His ideas formed the Revolution. Fabien! Tutoring? - And I wanted to say hi. - How nice. All is well? - Yes, and you? - Fine, very well. - I have two memories of my senior year. The hospital where my mom and I waited as my dad died. And your class, where I discovered philosophy. I had to tell you. - I'm touched. - How you said to hold on, to never let go, all your ideas and books. It annoyed me, a lot. But it helped me get by. - No need. You had an iron will. - It was more complicated. I skipped classes, got high at home. You put pressure on me. École Normale was your idea. My mom had no idea what it was. - Come on, it was your calling. It was obvious. Your essays were excellent, very clear. All I did was correct spelling. That's all. Is your PhD coming along? - No, not really. Since I stopped teaching, I do odd jobs. - Writing for my essay collection? - Or less fun stuff. I do other things in my free time. - Like what? - I'm involved in an anarchist group. I see my girlfriend. I enjoy life. - More to life than philosophy. - Can you get me a few copies of my essay on Adorno? - Sure, I'll pick some up at Cartet. I just finished this. It's great. Tell me what you think. - See you. - Thanks for stopping by. How did you manage today? - It was fine. - No problem entering the high school? - Yes. As I went in, a kid looked at me threateningly. - And? - I said, "I know who you are. One more step and you'll regret it." He ran away. - You were bluffing. - Nope. - What was your class on? - Empiricism and rationalism. - Were they concentrated? - Totally concentrated. - Of course. You terrorize them. - I make them responsible. On time and attentive. "One word about retirement and you're out." - How many Adornos do you want? - A dozen. Have you sold any? - Not many. We'll see in September. The Foucaults are downstairs. They still sell well. - How are you? - And you? - Fine. - Getting through these strikes? - Don't bring it up. - What are you two doing this summer? - If my mother lets us leave, we'll go to Heinz's place in Brittany. I can't wait. - This is Amèlie. Daniel has replaced Clèlia. I don't know if you've met. - I think we spoke on the phone. - So... we want to show you how we intend to redesign your textbook. - To discuss this new edition before undertaking anything. We want to maintain the specificity of the 2004 version. - It remains an anthology devoid of commentary that might come between teacher and student. A few figures... - Which way? - Like this. - Can you break them down? - In sum, according to qualitative analysis, Cartet remains the first choice of teachers. But sales figures give our competitors a big lead. Our aim is to strengthen its quality as a reference book, while striving to meet market expectations. Look through it at home. In short, our aim is to upgrade the textbook, to humanize it. - To give it the pedagogical makeover it needs. - We'd like to add facilitators and product tie-ins. - Make it more attractive, less austere. Show her the graphic designer's suggestions for the essay collection. - You're changing my collection? - It's the most costly and least profitable collection. - And the most prestigious. - No doubt, but we can't sit back and watch sales plummet. - Just a proposal. If you don't like it... - It's bad beyond belief. Like an ad for M&M's. What I've always fought against. - The original cover is classy but very plain. The new one is modern, aggressive, and catchy. We did tests. - It's really hard to miss. A total eyesore! - Mrs. Chazeaux! Sorry, but you must pay for the books. You get 50% off, of course. - We used to get 20 copies. Now you don't send them and we pay? - Taking the metro? Can I walk you? - I'd like that. - I read your protégé's text on Adorno. Brilliant, for sure. - I agree. - But I wonder if he can keep writing schoolbooks. - Why? It's extremely limpid. - He keeps advocating his radical ideas. It comes across in every line. - I prefer a text a bit rhapsodic by someone who thinks out of the box over the bland writing of marketing fiends. - They do their job. You know I didn't hire them. - Still in bed? Yeah, Pandora, hide. I bought you salmon and sheep-milk yogurt. I'm in a rush. I have the kids for lunch. Staying in bed all day? I got you the papers. "Le Monde" and "Libé." - Anything worth reading? - Besides the strike, Iranian repression, if you care. - Can't my grandchildren come visit? I miss them. - They'd come if you left your bed. And filled your fridge. - What do you think? Not bad, huh? - Where did you get it? - It's mine. - I never saw it before. Did you buy clothes again? Barbara Bui? Are you kidding? With what money? Another bad check? - I gained weight. - You went alone? - Inés came along. We took a taxi. - For someone depressed, you seem fine. - I had to buy something. I have a role next week. - Really? As what? - A TV crime movie. I play a cadaver. - Can you get my glasses? On the shelf. - At least it won't be tiring. - Guess again. Two hours of makeup. - Here they are. - Hello. - Let's eat. You okay? Who wrote the article? - Simone something. Italian name. - Not Simone Pozzi? - That's it. - I know her. A repulsive Stalinist. - When we met, your mom was handing out commie tracts. A real terror. - Okay, I was a communist. Three years. No shame. - Just three years... - Like most intellectuals then. - Not me. - No, not you. - She was even in the USSR. - So what? I came back disenchanted. I read Solzhenitsyn, end of story. - Always the last word. You never change. - We're not all clairvoyant like you. True, your father hasn't changed since he was 18. "Starry sky above and moral law within." Already his credo in '68. - Granted. - A barrel of laughs too. It's Fabien! - Who is it? - Her favorite, you know? - I have no idea. - The son she'd have liked. My opposite, physically and intellectually. - You're such idiots! - Her former student, the writer. - Now I see. - Quiet down! He's coming. Hello. You okay? Come in. - I won't bother you. - It's no bother. - I'm in a rush anyway. - Five minutes. Don't just stand there. Something wrong? - Sorry I look like a bum. I spent all night outside. - Outside? - Protesting against an eviction. - Have a seat. - Friends were arrested. My girlfriend got hit. - Nothing serious? - Not really. - Do you do this often? - Sometimes. - I got your books. They're on the table. How are my strawberries? - Delicious. - Have a seat. Have some strawberries. - I read your book. - What is it? - An incredible text on terrorism. - You never mentioned it. - What? Sure I did. - I didn't have the honor. - What did you think? - Very well written... but it preaches to the converted. - I don't think so. - I dislike how it confuses radicalism and terrorism. - No, I disagree. - Here. This just came out in French. - Günther Anders. - Who's he? - A philosopher. Hannah Arendt's first husband. - I'll make the coffee. - I was waiting for it to come back out. Can I write on it for your collection? - Why not? I'll read it and tell you. Thanks. - Let's see. - "The Obsolescence of Man." What's "obsolescence"? - Johann... - Just kidding. How do you say it in German? - Not great either. Pronounce it, Mom. - Stop teasing me! What is it? They've ganged up. You could have made an effort. You were like ice. - I don't like him much. - What don't you like? - Expert on everything, a real know-it-all. - You don't know him. - He fawns when he needs you but walks over you when you're in his way. - You're crazy! The sweetest, kindest student I've ever had. And he's brave. - Because he's Mr. Protestor? - Not just that. Spare me your sarcasm. Jealous? - Jealous. Please! - Dad! - Chloé. What a nice surprise. - I was nearby. - I think you want to say something. - Yes. But it's not easy. - Are you in trouble? I know. You're pregnant. - Not at all. - What is it, then? Tell me. - I know you're seeing someone. - Does Mom know? - Don't worry. I won't say. But Johann and I want you to choose. Quickly, Dad. "Mom" - Can the truth be debated? Go ahead. - I don't get it. Why couldn't it be debated? - Really? What about areas where it's established? - It's always contestable. - No one still says the sun revolves round the Earth. In science, there are established truths. Is that the only area? - History too. - Exactly. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, or Nazi extermination of Jews leave no room for debate. Be careful. Debating truth is one thing, contesting it another. - When can we say truth is established? - That's the question. In the end, the problem is less the existence of truth than criteria for establishing it. Distinguish between the areas where truth can be proved from those concerned with belief, conviction, faith but not established truths. - Like art. We can't speak of truth in art. - Really? We still question the genius of Homer and Shakespeare? - A recent movie said Shakespeare's a sham. - It's too late. Mozart, Proust, Van Gogh: time decided. There's truth in art, established over time. Why can't time get it wrong? - Excuse me. - Nathalie, it's me. I turned on the gas. I'm going to die. - I have to go. It's my mother. She's crazy. I have to see to her. Sorry. Antonia, I'll call you tonight for the next class. Tell your classmates, even the strikers. - They won't come. - Still... I'll send you the corrections. And read Alain's "Propos." I'll tell you which pages. Good-bye. How is she? I'm her daughter. - It's not serious. - You're her daughter? Enough. Three times this week, for nothing. - Three times? - Not true! He's lying! - We're firemen, not doctors. - I know. I'm sorry. I keep telling her. - Consider putting her in hospital. Call an ambulance but not us. - I won't go to hospital! I won't go! - Sign this release. She said she called you. Answer. - You know how often she calls? - Your mother is your responsibility. - I'm ice cold. Can I have my mink? The fireman who tended to me was cute. - I'll put you in a rest home for a bit. - You can't do that, Nathalie. - No choice. I thought your visitors would help. You can't be a minute alone. - Why don't you take me? - What else? You'll sleep in my bed too? I have a husband. - Yes, it's true. What's his name again? - You kidding? - No, I swear I forgot. His name? - Forget it. - Tell me! - His name is Heinz. - What? - Heinz. - Oh, yeah. What an awful name. How could you marry a guy with a name like that? - Hello, Mrs. Lavastre. How are you today? - Thanks. Go on in. - Already? - I said all I had to. - You have two hours left. Try. - What for? This won't change my grade point average. - Did Antonia choose the essay too? Good. That's not a problem. Don't worry about references. I'm exhausted. And you? What is it? Why so down? - I must tell you. I met someone. - Meaning? And why tell me? Couldn't keep it a secret? - I'm moving in with her. - What? Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Since when? - A while. - A student? Who, then? - You don't know her. - I thought you'd love me forever. I'm a goddamn idiot! - I'll always love you. You know it. - Come on. Lunch is ready. Just warm it up. - You're not eating? - Not here. Shit. - See you later. - Did we forget anything? - She didn't want her books? - No, oddly enough. We'll be back for Pandora anyway. I didn't expect this. I thought she'd scream. - She gave up. - Or worry about her cat. She doesn't care. She didn't even ask! - Those are our birds. We have many pets here. Our residents appreciate them. This is the dining room. Very pretty view of the countryside. - I asked for a room upstairs. I'll tell them to change it. - It's not a problem. I'm fine here. - I'll come back in two days. You can always call. You have a phone. You can go to the hairdresser. Get a manicure. If you knew how much this place cost... And it's five stars compared to the others. That fucking smell... Smell of death. - Pandora! Come on! Come out! - We have to remove the radiator. - Get inside. - It's so heavy! Damn... What a gift! And with my allergies... Go hide, dummy. What the hell? What a nerve! - Sorry I'm late. I'll lock my bike. - Another night outside? - I'm moving out of my studio. - Really? To what part of Paris? - To the mountains, in fact. - The mountains? - My friends and I bought a farm. A real steal. Very remote. - What will you do there? - Make cheese. - No, really? - Yes, really. Okay, not just that. I'm going to write too. - I can't come visit? - Of course. As often as you like. - Can I have a puff? I'm dying for one. - Want a cigarette? - No, just a puff. I have big news as well. Heinz and I are separating. I'm going to divorce. - Divorce? You seemed so... I don't know. United. - 25 years together and he found another woman. There you go. - Damn. Sorry. - No worries. I'm taking it very well. Anyway, after 40, women are fit for the trash. - How can you say that? Especially you! - It's the plain truth. Do many women my age leave their husbands? - There are tons of them. - In movies. - You'll obviously find someone. - Yeah, right. - Why not? - I suddenly find you naive. Who will I start over with? An old man? No, thanks. - Try young if you don't like old. - As if I'd settle down with a young guy. Not my style. It's not that serious. My life isn't over. Deep down, I was prepared. No reason to pity me. I'm lucky to be fulfilled intellectually. It's enough to be happy. - Really? - Yes, really. - What wisdom. - My house in Brittany saddens me. I mean my husband's family house. Every vacation since our wedding. It means so much to me. The love I put into it. The garden I planted, designed from A to Z. To think I have to give it all up. All my memories. The beach where I saw my kids grow up. Sorry. - Don't worry about it. - Swim. The water's amazing. - What are you doing? - Making room. - It's not your last time here. - Of course it is. What do you think? - I thought you'd keep on coming without me. With the kids. - No, I don't think so. I hope she likes flowers. It'd be a shame to abandon the garden. I worked so hard on it. - You're not overdoing it? - You won't face up to reality! You act like everything's the same. What planet are you on? Wake up! There's no dial tone. - I meant to call the phone company tonight. - What do I do? No reception here. - Did you try up on the road? - I have no network on the road! Pain in the ass! Yes, it's Nathalie Chazeaux. I'm calling to see how my mother is. I don't fucking believe it! It's Nathalie Chazeaux. I called a few seconds ago. It's to see how my mother is. Really? What do you mean? Since when? There's nothing you can do? But... I'm going back to Paris. My mother hasn't eaten in three days. There's a train in an hour. Can you drop me off? - It's not a ploy to get you back? - Of course it is. What should I do, let her die? Hello. Are you okay? Why do I subscribe you to papers if you don't read them? - I'm hungry. - They don't give me any food. Got something for me? Any strawberries? I'd love strawberries. And oysters too. - You're out of luck. But I have chocolate. The nurses complain you won't leave your room. Not even for the rec room. - Those old folk make me want to puke. - I'm expecting... more demonstrations. I am aware that people suffer. - Who is this guy? - Are you acting dumb? It's Sarkozy. President of France. - He's ugly. - You preferred Chirac? - He wasn't bad. He made love with his boots on. - What? Where did you hear that? - Everyone knows. Except for you. - Sorry, I'm a little late. - No big deal. - All well? - Yes, and you? - Are they for me? How beautiful. - What's his name? - I don't know. - What a funny cat. - It's my mother's. Pandora. She can't keep her. I'm allergic. If anyone wants her, she's yours. What are your vacation plans? - We are all going to my dad's, in Corsica. He'll be away. It'll be cool. We'll rent a car. And you? - I'd rather not discuss it. - We'll be back in August for our project. - A new website. Thanks to Simon. He's a computer whiz. - A website for what? - Philosophy. - How wonderful! - Don't worry. We won't write the texts. - What we're good at is doing layout, getting authors... the "publishing" side. We thought maybe you could sponsor us. - Write an occasional text, reread the main articles. - Maybe write editorials on current events. Seen from a philosophical angle, of course. - In fact, you want to hire me. - In a way. - What the hell? Come on, leave me alone. I missed the end of the movie as it is. - Can I walk beside you? - You've seen me now. - You're beautiful. - Go away. I don't feel like it. Yes? What? Fell? What do you mean, she fell? What, is she in a coma? What? - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, Father. My daughter, Chloé. - Have a seat, please. - I want the ceremony to be here. My mother lived nearby her whole life. She was very fond of this church. She rarely came, but... - Yes, I don't recall seeing her often. - But she was a believer. - She was raised by her grandmother. As a child she was very frail, always sick. Her mother died young. Her father was a thug. She barely knew him. My mother spent her life suffering from having felt abandoned. She didn't go to school. It was her biggest regret. She pushed me to go to university and become a teacher. She was proud her daughter taught philosophy. - What did she do? What was her passion? Did she work? - She was a model. She was very pretty. After that, a medical rep. She married three times. My father was her second husband. They divorced after two years. - Why divorce? - He was unfaithful. She loved him to the end. For her, he was the only one. - Are you an only child? She has regained this warmth in her eternal resting place. She leaves behind her a proud heritage of love... and of hope. What better tribute could you have rendered to your mother than becoming a philosophy teacher? For we know that doubt and questioning are inextricably bound up with faith. You have made this your life. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. - Les Ulis, next exit. - Not at all. We get off at Villebon-sur-Yvette. Then to the roundabout and take Youri Gagarine Street. - Make up your minds. - Turn here, Dad. - When? - Now! - You try! Their thing is bullshit. "This is what I see and what troubles me. "I look on all sides "and see only darkness everywhere. "Nature presents to me "nothing but doubt and concern. "If I saw nothing there which revealed a Divinity, "I would come to a negative conclusion. "If I saw everywhere the signs of a Creator, "I would remain peacefully in faith. "But, seeing too much to deny and too little to be sure, "I am in a state to be pitied. "I have 100 times wished that if a God maintains nature, "it should testify to Him unequivocally. "If the signs Nature gives are deceptive, "He should suppress them fully. "Nature should say everything or nothing "so I see which cause to follow. "But in my present state, "ignorant of what I am or of what I must do, "I know neither my condition nor my duty. "My heart inclines to know where is the true good "in order to follow it. Nothing would be too dear to me for eternity." - Let's go next door. Daniel will join us. - You summoned me? - After having consulted our marketing division, we decided not to renew the old textbook. - We prefer to start from scratch, with a new team. - Okay. Is that all? - We also have to say that the essay collection is being reviewed. But even repackaged, it seems iffy. The future seems compromised. - And the Horkheimer book? - The contract was signed. Though we do have doubts about an umpteenth text on the Frankfurt school. What's done is done. Christelle will contact you in September to finalize the layout. - Nathalie, I came by this morning for the rest of my things. I did my best to respect our agreement. I think we misplaced "The World as Will and Representation." If you find it, can you put it aside? Thanks. - Oh, man! No way! My Levinas books with all my notes. Unbelievable. And Buber too? How could he? Bastard! It's too much! Thanks a lot. - How are you? - And you? Here she is! - Safe trip? - It was fine. She's heavy. - What's her name? - Pandora. - Hey, Pandora! Full house. It's a mess. - Excellent. Who's there? - German friends who run an alternative publishing house. We're finishing a book together. I'm being unfaithful. - Go on, I got fired. - No way! - Your Horkheimer essay is still coming out. So what's your book about? - Finding a way out of the concept of disaster. But while refusing political compromise. Creating a real countervailing power, alternative lifestyles. - Quite an agenda. Be good or it's the forest. Understand, Pandora? Don't give me those googly eyes. - ♪ A curly-headed kid ♪ ♪ With a sunshiny smile ♪ ♪ Heard the roar of a plane ♪ ♪ As it sailed through the sky ♪ ♪ To her playmates she cried ♪ ♪ With a bright twinkling eye ♪ ♪ My daddy rides that ship in the sky ♪ ♪ My daddy rides that ship in the sky ♪ - Nice music. - I'm sick of it.

So, Nathalie... Nathalie, this is Hugo. - How are you doing? - Want to see your room? - It's gorgeous! This cat is unbearable. What a pain. I really have to get rid of her. - Give her away. - To who? An old black cat. Obese, to boot. Would you take her? - Not after that description. Elsa, Nathalie... And Clemens. - Fabien speaks highly of you. - Really? - Your husband was my teacher. - Really? I hope he didn't leave a bad memory. - He traumatized some students. Not me. - Really? - It's thanks to him I went to study in Berlin. At Humboldt. I've moved away from his ideas now. Old-fashioned, isn't he? - It's not him who got you into anarchism. Why are you here? I told you not to go out! Come back on the double! Pandora! Where are you going, dummy? Come back! - Such authority! - She's never been out. She won't survive. - Sure she will. What about instinct? - After ten years at my mother's feet, she mustn't have much. - She'll be back once she's hungry. Our priority has been print. But not for readers. - Come back! - We've always been against authorship. My texts belong to whoever reads them. - These are the dogmas we must question. - If we give up anonymity, it will be seen as betrayal. It's the starting point of our review. - We can't call ourselves a collective, then backtrack to reestablish the idea of the author. - If we do, we lose all credibility. - Denying reality won't lead to a new way of thinking. We're conforming to stereotypes. You submit to the system you denounce, ruled by the notion of the individual. - By signing, you don't submit? - No, the struggle is elsewhere. I agree with Fabian. By not signing our name, we don't abolish the notion of the author. We draw even more attention to ourself. Meanwhile, waiting to benefit from the prestige of an anti-author position. - What do you say? - About what? - Questioning authorship. - Me? Nothing. - Come on. A philosophy teacher. - You know, I think I'm too old for radicality. - Why? - I've done that before. I've been there. Okay, I have changed. - But the world is the same. Only worse. Pandora! Pandora! Pandora? There you are! I don't believe it! A mouse! You want a compliment? You're filthy! Yuck! Little thug! You'll see. Here you are. Punishment time! Raymond Aron? Damn. - Sleep well? - Yes, and you? - So? Did the midnight rambler come back? - Yes, this morning. She had the nerve to bring me a mouse. - You see. Instinct. - Yep. I didn't know Zizek was among your references. Isn't he fishy? - I have lots of books. I don't agree with all of them. - And the Unabomber wrote a book? I hope you place more value on human life. - I want action to be compatible with thought. It isn't what you teach. - Why do you say that? I always insisted on making actions and thoughts compatible. I try to practice it myself. - Yeah, okay. But only in the private sphere. - How so? - You don't let everyday behavior betray your values. You don't envision a thought system requiring a change in your lifestyle. - Meaning? - You think demonstrations and petitions make you a committed intellectual. Clear conscience, same lifestyle. - You mean my bourgeois lifestyle? Why not outgrow these schemes? I think they're sterile. - Because it suits you. - Revolution is not my goal. It's true. Mine is more humble. To help kids think for themselves. We may disagree, but I thought I taught you that. I have to go to Paris tomorrow morning. - Really? - I just spoke to my super. There's a leak at my place. - Shit. Sure you have to go? - Yes, unfortunately. I'm going to bed. - I've disappointed you. - It's not the opposite? - Not at all. - So all's well. Good night. - Good night. Good night. - I wasn't nice. It upsets me. I think she took it badly. - Here we are, back home. "One year later" How are you? You're here? Can I hold him? - Let me. I just got here. - Can you wash your hands? - Yes. My turn. - It seems he looks like me. - Like you? You crazy? Not at all. - Yes, a little. - Absolutely not. - Yes, his chin. - What crap. The nonsense you have to hear! He looks like me. - Good-bye. - Bye. - Finally! I thought he'd never leave. You're so beautiful. Those little hands... He's yawning! Time to go to sleep. - What's wrong? Is it what I said about your father? I was joking. Honey. It's no big deal. Don't cry. Talk to me. - Give me back my baby. - "So long as we desire, we can do without happiness. "We expect to achieve it. "If happiness fails to come, "hope persists, "and illusion's charm lasts "as long as the passion causing it. "Thus, this condition suffices to itself "and the anxiety it inflicts is a pleasure "which supplants reality, perhaps bettering it. "Woe to him who has nothing to desire! "He loses everything he owns. "We enjoy less what we obtain than what we desire, and are happy only before becoming so." Julie is recalling her former passion, unrequited, with Saint-Preux. She had hoped to know true bliss with him, and this hope made her happy. Julie could then be happy, substituting dream for reality. "That state sufficed unto itself." This is the power of imagination. It compensates for the absence of the loved one with a pleasure that is purely mental, unreal in a way, yet nevertheless effective. For people with a lot of imagination, like Julie, but probably Rousseau as well, phantasmagorical satisfaction is a real comfort that supplants, replaces, carnal pleasure. - Staying a few days? - Just tonight. How are you? - Good, and you? - Very good. - How was the trip? - Fine. - He's over there. - Hello. - Hey there. - How are you? - And you? I'm glad to see you. - Me too. - Sorry I couldn't pick you up. - No problem. - The farmers brought us meat. I offered them a drink. They wouldn't leave. - Can I help? - No, go get settled. Your room is ready. I won't be long. - Look, Pandora. Remember? You already came once. You'll love it here. - Can I see the monster? - Under the bed.

What are their names? - This is Faloud, the oldest. - And? - They're Java and Omega. - None is named Cadichon? He's fat. - She's in foal. - Pregnant? Name one baby Cadichon. - Okay, why not? - I love donkeys. Remind me of my childhood. I lived in a house with donkeys as a kid. Any plans for Christmas? - Elsa and I aren't into family stuff. Want any? - Grass? Should I? It's not too strong? - I don't know. Try. - Take it easy. - I don't think you'll come back to Paris. - I like it here. More time to write. - How do you get by? - We teach at university in Grenoble. And there's schoolbooks, Internet... - Is that enough? - For now. It'll be harder if we have a kid. And you?
