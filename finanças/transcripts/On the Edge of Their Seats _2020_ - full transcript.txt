It can't be helped. - Here? - Yes. It's so hot! - It's a little cooler here. - Yeah. - It's nice here. - Yeah. It's too loud down there. It is. - Out? - Yeah, they're returning to the bench. - Now we defend? - Maybe? Did they score? - But he caught it. It's out, right? - I think so. Then why that guy... over there... - In 3rd base? - Yes, him! He ran, why out? He know he'd drop it? If you can't catch it, you can also run, right? I see. I think he dropped it. That's what I said. - We thought he caught it... - It wasn't out? - But he dropped it. - Exactly! - Was it out?! - We'll never know. - There's a seat down there. - I'm fine here. Okay. [On the Edge of Their Seats] Just now, it was a normal OUT, right? Yeah, the change after 3 outs. So hot! I wonder what's over there. Everyone is going in. They are. But why? So they don't get hit by a foul ball! - It happens? - Yeah. Foul balls are scary. - They can kill you. - Really?! Yeah. My uncle told me he was hit by one. - Did he die? - No, he's alive. - But you said you'd die. - Uh? - Whatever. - We should go too! - Fujino, you should evacuate too. - It's field maintenance. What? The 5th inning just ended, right? They're doing field maintenance before the 6th. So people go to the bathroom, or buy drinks. - You know a lot, don't you? - Not really... - You just arrived? - Yeah. - You're late. - I had supplementary lessons. - But I was on time. - Uh? I was at the supplementary class too, but I got here on time. No, I... Hey, you! What are you doing up there?! Come in front and cheer for the team! You guys too! Go! Miyashita, go down. Go with the others. Cheer for the team. That's how you make friends! What baseball is for! Let's cheer! Stand up! Stand up, let's practice! Stand up!! Let's do it! 1, 2, 3, GO! Oh, you people. Human life... is a strikeout after another! But you shouldn't be afraid of swinging the bat! - Got it? - Uh? Do you understand?! - Yes! - Great! You're now the head cheerleader! Make sure to squash this insurrection! I'm counting on you! Hey! Hey, you! What was that? I was appointed to something? You don't know him? New teacher, he just transferred. Okay, let's practice! 1, 2, 3. Go! Go! Go! Come on! Fujino, you're not in the English elective class, right? - So... why? - Uh? Why were you late? Hum... I got lost. You got lost coming here? I wasn't sure if I wanted to come. Yeah, I didn't want to come either. Really? Why do we have to come during summer vacation just to cheer for the team? And mandatory... we even rented a bus. - It's ridiculous! - It is! I'd understand if this was a final! It's just the 1st round! Baseball always gets a preferential treatment! And why are the baseball players always so arrogant? It's so annoying, they make me dislike the team! Fujino, you're in the baseball team, right? - What were you saying? - No, I mean... I said hate? I mean like! - It's okay, don't worry. - No, really... I left the team. I resigned. - You did? - Yeah. They are arrogant, though. Yeah, like Sonoda. - Sonoda, uh? - The pitcher? Really? A few pro scouts came to see him. - Really?! - Amazing! - Scouts always come to the matches. - Still amazing! This stuff doesn't happen in theatre. Theatre? We're in the theatre club. There are no pro scouts for theatre. Like... theatre scouts touring the whole country, coming to see us. What do you do at theatre competitions? Theatre. I mean... do you have district-level and prefecture competitions? Yes! I write the script. We got to the regional level. - Amazing! - Right? - What about you, Tamiya? - Uh? - Sorry, what? - I mean... Regional level, that's amazing. - This year? - Last year. - What about this year? - Nope. Why? Busy with the exams? The regional competition is during the school year... but the national is next year, in the summer. So you can't go to the nationals the same year, even if you win the regional? Right. - That's weird. - If you say so. So... What? Still doing ground maintenance, uh? It's hot today. So the ground is really dry. Is dry ground bad? - High chance of irregulars. - Irregulars? When the ball bounces weird. - Where are you going? - To buy drinks. - I'll go. - No need! - I want to! - But why?! I wanted to buy drinks too. What do you want? - I don't know, tea? - Okay, wait here. Aren't you tired? Why don't you sit down? - I'm good. - I see. It's so hot! I did not expect I'd be forced to come here for remedial classes. Yeah. Which college? - The prefecture one. - Me too! - Really? - Can you do it? - My grades are not great. - I see. Yeah. - Same for me. - I see. Well, we're taking remedial classes. I thought if I entered Higashi Iruma I'd be able to go to prefecture uni... Me too. So this is how my last summer as a junior is gonna be, uh... What did you expect? I don't know. For it to feel... more like youth! Youth? Like how? Well... The school baseball tournament feels like youth. What about theatre? Feels like youth? I wonder. Didn't you go to the Kanto competition? Well... no, actually. The day of the performance, the club members all got influenza. They couldn't come. - Really? - Yeah. - That's a shame. - It can't be helped! But you worked hard on the script, didn't you? You wanted it to be performed, no? I did my best! But as I told you... we couldn't perform. That's it. - I see. - Can't be helped. We want a comeback! Let's cheer! They're much stronger than us, aren't they? Yeah... they played at the nationals this spring. Their number 4 is quite famous, isn't he? Matsunaga? Yes. Five home runs in the spring tournament. Then it's great that we are only 1 point down. If it weren't for Sonoda, it'd be much worse. I see. He only conceded 9 points in the qualifications. He's great. - You are well informed. - Not really. And yet you didn't want to come. We are friends. Is that so. But we don't talk much now. You two! Why aren't you cheering?! Maybe you think the cheering has no effect on the game? - We just... - I don't get it! You know, human life is like... a sacrifice bunt! Uh? The batter can't run on the bases but he still puts his heart in the match! But earlier you said life is like... Shut up! Cheer for the team! Shout like you mean it! It helps the team! Got it?! Let's all cheer together! - Come on, Miyashita! - You already said that! Just do it! Let's go!! Like this! You're in the theatre club, right? Shout from your belly. - Let's go!! - Hey... Listen, that wasn't from your belly. You're using your throat, and you can actually hurt yourself... you should be careful. What are you talking about? Let's g... - You've hurt your throat. - Not at all. Listen, what I'm saying is... we should cheer together, like we're one! Our feel... Let's cheer! Is he okay? He's like that during class? Yes. He keeps rambling about teamwork, and makes us work in pairs. And it's not my thing. Yeah. Welcome back. - Is the teacher sick? - Why? - He was coughing up blood. - Yeah, he hurt his throat. Being in charge of the baseball club is not easy. He's not. He is not? Which club then? I wonder. - The Tea Ceremony Club. - Really?! - You're not supposed to shout, there. - Definitely not. - Here. - Thank you! Uh?! - You wanted tea, right? - This is black bean tea. Not good? I... I meant something like Oi-Ocha... - Sorry! I'll go back. - It's okay! - But I got it wrong! - No! - You wanted Oi-Ocha! - I'll drink this! - But... - It's fine! - Really? - I'll drink this. Black bean tea is super healthy! - Sorry. - It's okay. - Black bean tea! - Where's Miyashita? I wanted to give her this. Do you want it, Fujino? Yeah, sure. I wonder why Miyashita came to the match, that's strange. Yeah, she's always studying. She has always been top of her year. But she wasn't in the latest mock exams. - Yeah, I heard. - Is that so? She was 2nd, it was a shock. How do you know? Well, she's a celebrity. - Who got 1st place? - Tomoka. - Tomoka? - Kusumi. Head of the brass band. That girl, with the trumpet. Ah, Kusumi. You don't know her? I don't remember all the girls' names. But you know Miyashita. That's because she's famous. I wonder how she feels. First time she's not at the top. I'm sure she feels bad. But she's so hard to talk to. - Really? - Yeah. We were paired in English class once... she just read the textbook in complete silence. But she gets along with the teacher. Really? They're close? The teacher really likes her. Miyashita! Where are you going? - Toilet. - I'm coming with you! No, wait... I didn't mean that. Oi-Ocha, uh? That's good... astringent. Oi-Ocha is the best! I... I'm sorry you have to do this. You come talk to me because I'm always alone. That's not... Do I really need to make friends? You don't! But, you see... studying together, competing with each other... talking with each other... is fun, isn't it? Okay, fine. I'll be honest with you. You see... I push you to cheer with everyone else... because I want you to experience the real spirit of baseball. That's why? I thought it was because you wanted to be in the coach seat. That's not it! The real cheering comes from the spectators' seats! That's why I'm here! Me? Coach? What are talking about? I'm the tea ceremony club advisor! And I Love Tea Ceremony! A tea lover would never say that bottled Oi-Ocha is great! No, I... You... Don't! Miyashita! Hey! We should cheer together! - Please stop... It's too hot. - They're not playing right now. - It's so hot! I want to go home. - Don't say that! Let's go!! We're no longer on offence? Since a while ago. That was fast. We couldn't hit. Over there... what do these people in defence do? The outfield? Yes. Are they doing anything? - Of course! - But nobody looks at them. It may look like that, but people notice them. Like when? - They don't! - They do! Like for example... when they make a mistake. Sad! People only notice them when they make a mistake?! No, listen... do you know Yano? - Yano? - In the baseball team? He's sitting on the bench. - He's not playing. - Why? - Zero skills. - Rude! It's true. Take batting. This is how you do it. But he... does this! Do it again. I said... this is the right way. But he does... this. - Do you get it? - Nope. - Completely wrong! - I don't see it. - This way... - Which one? - This is the right way. - Okay. And this is him. - Yano? - Yeah. Disappointing, Miyashita. - Your ranking in the mock exam. - Tomoka beat you! Stop it! It was just luck. Sorry. I didn't care. I've never cared about rankings. Liar! You're clearly upset! - Wait... - Miyashita! - What was that? - Not cool. As I said! The right way... is like this! - And Yano? - He does... this! Got it?! Maybe you're just bad at explaining. Whatever... I'm a pitcher, I don't use the bat. - Wait, really? - Yeah. Then why did you waste so much time on that?! Uh? What's happening? - I'm lost. - Two-bases. - What's that? - Two bases hit. What's that? - 1st, 2nd, and 3rd base. - Okay. That's 2nd base. He ran two bases in one hit. - Matsunaga! - Who? - Number 4 over there, he's so cool. - How do you know him? - I just do. - But how? But I know nothing about baseball. - It's in. - Whoa. They got us. 3 - 0. That was expected. They're on another level. - Where are you going? - Trash bin. - I'll go! - No need... - I want to go. - It's fine. - Toilet, too. - Let's go together! Well? - We're on offence! - Tell us how it goes. - It's so hot! - It is. It's a little high, try to keep it lower. - Hey, we're starting! - We know. - She's fired up... - For Sonoda, uh? - So hot! - Hooot! Hoooot! Excuse me... Excuse me. - You were in the team, right? - What? You know the guys, right? I mean... not that well. Can I ask you something? Sure. What do you want to know? It's about Sonoda... what does he like besides baseball? What? Why are you asking me? You were teammates. Yeah. Why don't you ask him? Sorry. It's okay. I don't think he likes anything else. Nothing? Besides baseball? He only cares about baseball. - Probably. - I see. - How are we doing? - Two outs, no runner. Shame. I love this song. - Sonoda really likes this song. - Does he? "TRAIN-TRAIN". We always play it when Sonoda is batting. They get to choose? Not everyone... but he does. Kusumi is really fired up, isn't she? They're dating, you know. Sonoda and Kusumi? What? Really?! Wait, wait! Forget I said that! - Since when?! - Wait, no! I didn't say it! - Since when? Since when?! - Forget about it! It's not like that, forget about it I said! I thought he only cared about baseball! - Wait a minute! - What?! - It's not like that! - So they're not dating? - So they are dating! - I said... Sonoda hit! - Sonoda and Kusumi, uh? - Again?! I said nothing! - Wait, what? Are you okay? - Miyashita? - Are you okay? - Yeah. You're not, let's go inside. - I'm fine... - You're all sweaty! Fujino, help me! Quick! Here. - Can you do it? - Yeah. You're not helping! Sorry, here I go. Let's go. What happened? We got this, just watch the game. Should I come too? [conversation with Sonoda] [21:00] Hey, are you home? Can I call you? [22:34] Can I call you? [22.42] Sorry, I'm trying to focus. [22:47] Ok, sorry! Good night! [7.01] Good morning! Hey Tomoka. The teacher said we need to be louder. He says the other side is louder... but they've got more people. Okay. I'll talk to the band. It's too late, it can't be helped now! Hey. Look over there. That's an unusual group. What's up with her? Miyashita is not feeling well. But I don't think it's serious. - I'm coming too! - There's no need, really! Listen... - Can we stop doing this? - Eh? If you keep doing that, I'll feel even worse. - No, but... - Not buts. That's enough. It has been 6 months. It's not your fault, Hikaru. It was influenza, right? When it comes, everyone gets it. - But... - On the other hand... If I had gotten it, would you have blamed me? See? It couldn't be helped. But you worked so hard... Human life is like a sacrifice bunt. What? I don't know, like... the batter won't hit the ball, to let the runner run. So? So... if you can't make it, cheer for the ones that are trying, right? That's what it means. So stop feeling bad and move on, Hikaru. Focus on the entrance exams and more important stuff. So let's stop. - Well.. the drink? - Sorry, I'm coming. - I can... - Don't worry, I'll go. Watch the match. The runner couldn't advance. They just keep hitting and hitting... - and we never hit. - Yeah. It's tough. A rural school versus a team that always goes to the nationals. - That's just rough. - Yeah. "It can't be helped", as they say... there are times when you just have to accept it. I think so. Fujino, why did you quit the baseball team? I was telling you about how bad Yano is at baseball. Bad... like how? I still don't get it. He's always in the bench, he never plays a match. Despite that, he always practice so hard. And when I saw him, I always thought "why does he even do that?!" As for me... I'm a pitcher, right? And we already have Sonoda... so I'll never get a chance to pitch. So I don't even try. I see. You know, at first... I thought that if I worked hard I wouldn't be left behind. I was wrong! We both practised hard, but he's still much better then me. It's frustrating. And that's why I quit. Yano is still in the team, though. I did the right choice, didn't I? Yeah... I think you did. Yeah. I practised for 3 years... I never played a game, I was never praised. Then why I shouldn't spend my time in a more meaningful way? Like for studying? No... I didn't use it for studying. Why? Ugh, again. Are you sure you don't want to go the doctor's office? - I'm okay. - But... I want to watch the game till the end. Okay. Did something happen? You look sad. Miyashita, do you ever say to yourself "It can't be helped"? "It can't be helped?" Like when you try your best, but it doesn't go well... you think "it can't be helped", and just accept it. Sorry, forget what I said. You're talking about Yasuda, aren't you? Yeah. I didn't have a conversation partner in the English class, and she called me. She told us. But you couldn't make conversation, right? She didn't want to be mean! She can be shy too. It made me happy. That Yasuda approached me. But I couldn't make conversation. I... I'm not athletic... And I'm dull... My only quality is that I'm diligent... so I try to do my best and study hard. That's great, too. I shouldn't have come. It was a bad idea. And I've troubled you, too. In the end I couldn't even cheer for Sonoda. Sonoda? No, I... Here. You need something salty. Kusumi is really amazing, isn't she? She's head of the band, but was also able to beat Miyashita at the mock exam. And she's dating Sonoda. You knew that? Everyone knows that. But Tamiya before was acting like it was some kind of secret. Oh... I think that's because I told her not to tell anyone. But everyone already knows. Yeah... because I told everyone. You're the worst. But yeah, she is amazing. The band, homework, and even love. Shinkenzemi style. Stop it. That felt like youth. Miyashita? Take it. Vending machines are super expensive here. The tea was 200 yen. You should take it. Don't ignore me! I'm... I'm trying. You look like an idiot. So what? Even if I'm ignoring you... you still have everything I want. What does that mean? You know nothing. I'm average. But that's why I work hard. I give everything. So I think I deserve to be rewarded. What's strange about that? Being in the spotlight is tiring too. If you don't want this, I'll take it. Sure. You know... I like Sonoda, too. Asuha doesn't like him much, so I can't tell her. He's so cool, isn't he? - Uh... - He's tall... and has a nice voice! - Err... - His voice! I'm quite fond of him. - Quite? - Quite. - "like"... how? - Do you like him too, right? Yes. - Quite. - I'm glad I have a mate! - Two runners are out? - Yeah. That's sad. - He dropped it! - What happened?! It's over, isn't it? They're going to score. We really only pay attention to these guys when they mess up. Can't be helped! Was that out? Yeah. Change. - Welcome back. - We're back. - Eight more times? - Yeah, they scored. 4-0, that's harsh. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Thanks for before. - I didn't do anything! - Okay... Sonoda is getting tired now. After that home run. It can't be helped. They're just stronger than us. Listen... Can you stop saying "it can't be helped"? Me? Stop saying "it can't be helped". Why? Sonoda is doing his best. Why would you say that? Did I upset you? You're doing your best, and you hear people around you say "It can't be helped", imagine how that feels. And... there are also other people around here who don't want you to say such things. Miyashita. People also say that to me. "It can't be helped", I was told. I was doing my best... but they said it anyway. But it's not something you'd have experienced, Miyashita. You! - I want to hear your voices! - Sensei, you hurt yourself. You don't get it, do you? All together! Let's shout and cheer all together! Miyashita! Let's goooo! - Sensei! Please stop shouting! - Enough! We're here to support the team! So let's do it! It's a waste of time! We're just spectators. - Waste? - It's pointless! We are not on the field! It doesn't matter how much we shout! Shameful! Let's goo! Your voice is gone! It doesn't matter how hard you try! It does matter, you idiot! Fine, I have no voice now. And yet... I still incarnate the spirit of baseball! So stop whining! Find your own spirit! Shout! Aren't you in the drama club?! - Enough! - Let's goooo! That's right! Shout! Shout from your guts! - Shout again! - Let's gooooo! Ugh. Poorly hit. What? - Irregular. - Yay! See, your voice did reach the field! It does work, after all! You're now the head cheerleader! Make all these slackers cheer! What was that? Enough with the "it can't be helped". The teacher is great, isn't he? He arrived 3 months ago.... but he knows we're in the drama club. Isn't that normal? I'm not in his class, but he remembered about me too. Whatever... I'm glad we hit, anyway. Let's hope for the next one. [Notice of player substitution on loudspeaker] - Yano? - Did she say Yano? Yano?! What was that?! A bunt? - Poor thing. - Eh?! Doesn’t matter how hard he tries, he can only bunt. But... still great, isn't it? - He doesn't seem happy to me. - Still! Run! Run! The guy in 1st base got to 2nd. Was that a sacrifice bunt? It was, wasn't it?! Fujino, he did a sacrifice bunt! Did you see that, Miyashita?! Wonderful! Do you think he's glad? I'm sure he is! But it was a bunt. I mean, he worked so hard.... and he was always on the bench. But today he did play. I'm sure he's happy. Asuha... The theatre contest... let's try one more time. Go! Run! Run! - Yes! - We scored one point! - Incredible. - And Yano helped! Even if we try again this year, we can't go to the nationals. - I know. - Then what's the point? For baseball, you can aim to play at the nationals. - But we know we won't go the nationals. - It doesn't matter! I... just want to be on the stage with you one more time. Ouch, he caught it. He got to 3rd base? - Wait... scored? - I don't know. He caught it, right? It means out. I think he dropped it. Wait, you're right. I thought he did catch it.. - but actually he dropped it. - Exactly! - What? It's out? - I don't get it... It's a mystery. Ugh! But we're 4-2, we could catch up in the next inning! Even if we score again, we'll just be even. We definitely can hold them back! - You don't know that. - We're doing our best! We can't just give up! Right, Miyashita? We have Sonoda. We can hold them back. Go, Sonoda! Strike! Miyashita, let's cheer together! - Let's shout! To support Sonoda! - But... Strike! Come on, shout! Come on! One more ball. Come on! Come on. Strike out! Sonoda is so good! Only one left! But... Matsunaga... But we can hold them back. - Foul! God, that scared me. - Same. - But it's strike one. - Yeah. - Dangerous! - Almost an home run... Scary... - Sonoda is surely even more scared. - Yeah. Yeah. He probably didn't expect this. Ouch, ball! In the middle of the stadium, on camera... fighting alone against a monster. - It must be terrifying. - Yeah. From here they may look like they're from another planet... But it's a high school team, like us! But I still wonder how he must feel. Ball again! This is too tense! Throwing from the strike-zone must be scary. If you get 4 balls you can go to 1st base, right? Yeah. At this point, we should just get another one. - Like let them advance on purpose? - And then hold their next player. Sonoda must be considering it! Hey! Why are you even there?! Are you playing for us?! Who do you think you're playing for?! The only thing he wants when he's out there is not to loose! That's how he is! We held them back, they didn't score! Sonoda is amazing! He really beat Matsunaga? We may even surpass them in the next inning. You know, Nakayashiki.. wrote his "Kansaku Macbeth" when he was a senior in high school. - Hikaru... - What? This year, let's get properly vaccinated. Sure. - Do you get it? - Yeah. I said: "this year, let's get properly vaccinated". - For the admission exams, right? - Wrong! - You didn't get it. - I get it. I'll get vaccinated. Whatever, let's talk about it later. You! It's the last assault! Let's cheer! I want to hear you! [text message: Last one! Do your best!] Last one! Let's do our best. Come on, we did enough. - We keep cheering! - We already lost! It's not over yet! We keep cheering. We keep cheering! Do it! Fine, fine. Everyone, let's do it. Let's go. Let's go! Hit it hard! It worked! Great! - Keep going! - Let's gooo! - Almost! - Good job! - Let's go! - Yoshita! - Two out. - One more person? - That's ok! - Good job! This song means... [Pitcher 4, Sonoda] - It's Sonoda. - Yeah. It's up to him. Go! Almost! - He hit it good! - He did! - Next one too! - Go! Strike two. - Please hit it! - Hit it! Sonoda... Louder! You're losing to the trumpets! Shout! Do you want to lose to the trumpets?! Let's go! Sonoda! Do your best! Let's go! Hit it! Nicely hit, Sonoda! First and second base! We're catching up! Kusumi! Good performance! We're turning the tables! Very nice cheering. Directly from your belly. Here. Thanks for pairing with me in English class. Why now? - We're catching up! - We are! Whose turn is it? [loudspeaker: n. 6: Yano] - It's over? - Yeah. - Did we lose? - Yeah. [loudspeaker announcing final score of 4-2] You know... I'm glad I came. Thank you! What a shame! - So what happened? - Well, we talked about it... - It's not easy. - Yeah. It's not the same as being on the stage myself. It's different. But you must be happy you work in a theatre. Yeah, it's fulfilling. And the kids are cute. - Somewhere... - Asuha! Just in time! You're late! You said you wanted to see his debut! But yeah, I can't believe he's really a pro now. Even in college, he kept training hard, the coach told me. And that kind of training will make you good. Did you know? Asuha is a teacher here now. Yeah, she was telling me about the club activities. Speaking of clubs... did you know? The tea club went to the nationals! Which advisor? Atsugi! He didn't know anything about tea ceremony... and now he's going to the nationals! - Here! - Here? This place is the best, isn't it? - What? Fujino? - Long time. Why are you here?! I'm the one surprised to see you. But what a coincidence! This place is huge! It's not a coincidence... - I invited him. - What? I mean... - Wait, are you... - We're not! - We met each other by chance. - And then we exchanged numbers. And sometimes we go out for a drink. - I didn't know... - It's not like that! - This is sooo suspicious. - Where do you work, Fujino? This. We make baseball equipment. It's a small company. Recently I went to Nagoya for an amateur baseball tournament, and... he was playing for a big company. - But who? - Sonoda! That Sonoda?! I wonder how much they pay him. He pisses me off. You haven't changed, Fujino. - He's next. - Finally! [loudspeaker announcing Yano] Let's go! It's Yano's home-run?! Nope! It's a foul. Ugh! Calm down! Why are the rules so hard to understand?
