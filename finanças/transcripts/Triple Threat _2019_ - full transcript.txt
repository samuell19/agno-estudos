Subtitles by explosiveskull [ominous music] [whooshing] [Xiao Xian] Money is sizeable. It will destroy the crime syndicate. [in Mandarin] Oh, there! [in English] Perhaps I didn't make myself clear enough at the board meeting last week. [camera shutters clicking] It was my father's company, it is now my company. But the money will go to Maha Jaya. We are done here. [cell phone beeps] [in Mandarin] Hi, Tian Xiao Xian. I'm Madame Liang, head of Embassy Security. The ambassador has asked me to look after you. Call me Xiao Xian. [reporters chattering indistinctly] [camera shutters clicking] [reporter in English] With the increasing economic impact of Chinese businesses in Maha Jaya, crimes against the local Chinese community have been on the rise. The Chinese embassy has been working with the local authorities to take special measures to keep our countrymen safe. Now, with the alleged involvement of a powerful criminal organization, there is cause for even greater concern. Chinese heiress, Tian Xiao Xian, has just arrived in Maha Jaya with a plan to take down the syndicate. [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [foreboding music] [device beeping] That thing won't work out here. Those guys, they're our GPS and navigation system. That's why we brought 'em. [spits] [sniffs] [gun cocks] Ah, there you are. Look at you, looking all dapper. [Devereaux] Time to ruin your day.

[Su Feng] I'm glad we could put aside our differences on this. [man] He's a loose cannon. I think it's a mistake, but it's your play. We're square now. One more thing. [Su Feng] Get me her itinerary. [raindrops pattering] [elephant grunts] They are in the arena. [in Indonesian] It better be the two men I'm looking for. [foreboding music] [Jaka in Indonesian] Here you go.

He needs food. [Payu] I made one for him. He was trying to kill me. I would do the same. [Jaka groaning] We need to talk. I buried many of my friends because of you two. It's not what you think. You were with the killers that came into my camp. We were told we were on a humanitarian mission, but we were lied to. Hey! What about the prisoners? Oh, yeah, yeah, um, Dom, reunite them with the prisoners. - [grunts] - [groans] - [thwacks] - [thuds] This place reminds me of Boy Scout camp. - [Joey] In you go. - [thuds] A bunch of assholes there as well.

I can't diffuse this. - [Long-Fei] Go, go, go! - [Payu] Go! Everybody out, out! - Go! - No, you go! [beeping] [panting] [beeping] [explosion] [rumbles] We didn't fire our weapons. [Payu] We thought we were doing something good. [Long-Fei] Yeah, no good there. We were double-crossed and left for dead. We are after the same men. Who are they? [Payu] Some kind of criminal gang. Really bad guys. What were you doing at a camp? [Long-Fei] My men and I were paid to guard the place. It was just a job. We are soldiers for hire. Everyone uses us. So, what's your plan? Make money, finance, resupply. And then, it's payback. - [Payu] Yeah. - [glasses clink] Not much of a plan. You have a better idea? [sighs] Perhaps, we can work together. [Jaka] I have a lot of contacts. I can find anyone. But first... [groans] a toast. [Payu and Long-Fei groan] To new friends. - [Long-Fei] To new friends. - To new friends. [Payu] Yeah. [sighs] [Jaka] One more, don't be shy. Yup. [chuckles] Yeah. [foreboding music] [Xiao Xian in Mandarin] My father loved it here. How is the ambassador? He was a good friend of my father. [in Mandarin] He's doing well. He speaks highly of your father. [Liang] We'll arrive for your interview in an hour. I just want to say how much I admire the work you've been doing here for the past week. Thanks. I'm not sure I deserve it. Well, I think you do. And so do a lot of others. Thank you. It's good to hear that. Sometimes I feel like I'm walking alone. [Long-Fei groans] - [dishes clinking] - [groans] [Payu in English] What? [Payu sighs] He's gone. I didn't hear him leave. I guess he did not like my cooking. - [Long-Fei] Yeah, well... - [Payu] Yeah. There is that. [sighs] [groans] [grunts] [yawns] [foreboding music] I think we've been set up. What? [in Thai] Freeze! Put your hands above your head. Don't move! - Handcuffs! Bring them out! - Okay, officer. [ominous music] [exhaling] [in English] Oh, man. [sighs] [phone line ringing] [ringing] [in English] Yes? This is a message for Collins. [old man] Collins? No one here by that name. [Jaka]Trust me, he'll wanna know. You have a message for Collins, you can talk to me. [Jaka] Tell him that the two chaps from the jungle raid are in custody at Central Police Station. [door clangs shut] You take me to the nicest places. [snickers] [Payu] Are you being sent back to China? [Long-Fei] The gang took everything from us. I didn't want it to be this way. - [thwacks] - [grunts] - [thwacks] - [thuds] [tense music] Pa? [gasps, whimpers] [Long-Fei's dad in Mandarin] I want to go home. [echoing] I want to go home. [staff in English] Miss Tian, we're so pleased to have you. We'd like to lead into the interview with some background about your father, your inheritance. Would that be all right? Let's try to keep the personal questions to a minimum. I'm here for the charity. - Okay, sure, understand. - Great. [car horn honks] [man over phone] The two guides you used in the jungle are down at the Central Police Station. [Collins] Central Police Station? Really? Well, that is very interesting. I suggest you take care of this immediately. Understood. Those two little jungle rats who shouldn't have survived that explosion. That's not possible. We piled enough composition four in those cages to kill everything in the vicinity. Well, two resilient inmates at Central would disagree with you. Let's stay focused in on point. We'll deal with those mavericks as and when. [news program theme music playing] [reporter]Crimes against the local Chinese community. Have been on the rise. Chinese heiress, Tian Xiao Xian, will join Damon live in the studio today to talk about her plans to push back against the syndicate. [Damon] You know her as the daughter of Chinese real estate mogul, Tian Wai Gow. She's the heiress who set aside her pampered life, and shared her wealth with those in need. Since her father's passing, she has devoted herself and her family's fortune to philanthropy, crime prevention, and corruption in our city. It's my distinct pleasure to welcome Miss Xiao Xian. Thank you, Damon. [Damon] You were born to wealth. You've never had to work unless you decided to do so. So, why? Why take such a risk in such a dangerous cause? My father grew up here. And Maha Jaya is a very special place to him. [Xiao Xian] Children don't have the luxury of playing outside, because it's simply not safe. The investment allows us to build the infrastructure, so that the people of this country can have access to an education, creating real jobs and, in turn, an economy. My father told me that the greatest wealth is being able to live a life of service to others. I want nothing more than to give these people the same chance that I was given, so they can experience the joy of family, love, and a safe place to call home. These crime syndicates must go. The people, the children, are the future of this country. [metal gate clangs] [Xiao Xian] When I see them, I see... resilience, hope, and strength. [metal door slams] [Damon]We look forward to that. The donation you're making is very sizeable. It is not a donation. It is an investment in humanity. [Xiao Xian] The money allows them to have options, so that they can get on the right side of the law. So that crime syndicates don't have a grip on these people through fear. [radio chimes] All right, she's leaving the hotel. Ten-four. Moving forward. What kind of security are we talking? Rent-a-cops. They'll scatter as soon as we turn up the heat. We are in business. [gun clicking] [Joey] Let's do it. [car engines revving] Thank you, Xiao Xian. [Damon] It has been an honor to speak with you today. [Xiao Xian] Thank you so much. [car engines revving] [tires screeching] [foreboding music] [brakes screeching] [Collins] Go! Go! Move! Move! [gunfire] [groans] - [rapid gunshots] - [all gasp] - [gasps] - [in Mandarin] Hide behind me. [rapid gunshots] [groans] - [groans] - [Xiao Xian gasps] [groans] [rapid gunshots] [groans] [rapid gunshots] - [groans] - [blood squelches] - [in Mandarin] Don't mind me. - [gasps] [rapid gunshots] [gasps] [in Mandarin] Run to the police station. They'll get you to the embassy. What about you? Don't mind me. Three, two, one. [rapid gunshots] [panting] [gunshots] [in English] Joey, get in the van. [Collins] Devereaux, move to market. Dom, you go south. Steiner, you're with me, now! [tires screeching] [rapid gunshots] [gasps] Can you please help me? Please! Please! Police station! Please! - Take me to the police station! - Okay. [Xiao Xian] Right away! [engine revs] [sighs] [clinking] [officer 1 in Thai] Stop! - What are you doing? - [officer 2 in English] Stop! [groans] [grunting] - [gunshots] - [in French] ...son of a bitch! [tires screeching] [car engine revving] [Collins] Come on! Get in! Let's go! Dominique's dead. He was out of control. She's gone. Fucked off in a tuk-tuk. The intel was wrong. You almost got us killed. Deal with it, Devereaux. We get paid to almost get killed. Key word. "Almost." Quit your moanin'. [Collins] There's another loose end we need to deal with. [Devereaux] Who's more important than killing the girl? Your two zombie trackers back from the dead, that's who. They can ID every single one of us. They need to be silenced. You wanna hit the police station? Yes, a police station, not a castle with a fuckin' moat. [Collins] Those cops are on cruise control. They won't be expecting us. I'm surprised if they're even awake. [thrilling music] [in Thai] Please! Help me! Please! [in English] Please! Help me! Please! They've been trying to kill me. [pants] I... I was just in a shootout. Do you understand? Do you... [groans] Do you speak English? Chinese? Look at this! That's me! See? That's me. - [Xiao Xian] Yes. That's me. - [in Thai] She's on TV. [officer 3 in Thai] Come in! Here. [in Thai] Sit down! [in Thai] Take it easy, officer. [sighs] [shackles click] [in Thai] You are involved in illegal fighting and gambling. Are you asking me or telling me? - [snickers] - [thumps] [in Thai] Don't lock it up yet. Move. [officer 4] Chinese? [in English] I would say we have five to ten minutes max. Go in and out quick, shock and awe, baby. Devereaux, you're on the wheel. Joey, you're with us. Let's go. [Joey] Let's go. [in Mandarin] Hey, you're the one on TV? [in Mandarin] You're Chinese? Great! [officer 4 in Thai] Ask her what happened at the hotel. [in Mandarin] Tell him someone is trying to kill me. [in Thai] You think you're better than us? [detective] Because you are an ex-soldier? You're nothing but a pussy to me. How about this? If you don't talk, you go to prison! [explosion] [all gasping] [in Mandarin] Stay low and away from the windows! [officer 5 in Thai] Let's move. [officer 6] See what's happening. - [gunshots] - [officer groans] [rapid gunshots] [officer 3] Go, quickly! We have to bring chief out of here. Guard him! - Don't let him go anywhere! - [officer 3] Yes, sir! [rapid gunshots] [man groaning] [explosion] [in Mandarin] [Xiao Xian] They're coming! Can you get me out of here? I don't know how. [grunting, mumbling] - [rapid gunshots] - [officers groan] [tense music] - [rapid gunshots] - [groans] [in Thai] Officer, please let me go! [both grunt] - [grunting] - Let's sort this out, officer. - [clinking] - [Payu groans] [in English] Stop! - [rapid gunshots] - [officers groan] Long-Fei! Stay here! [rapid gunshots] Shit. We need to find another way out. [female officer gasping, panting] Get up! On your feet! [gasping] Where do they keep the prisoners? [in Thai] Where are the prisoners? [in Thai] They aren't here! All prisoners are locked up downstairs. [in English] Prisoners are downstairs in holding. [Steiner] Mook! Break out the door! - [explosion] - [groaning] [Collins on radio] Check every single hallway. Mook, I need you upstairs with me. I'm on my way, Collins. [electricity crackling] [panting] Just who I was looking for. The girl had nothing to do with this. She's everything to do with this. What? [Payu] What are you talking about? This is my lucky day. - [thuds] - [Steiner groans] Get out of here! [both grunting] [loud thud] [grunts] - [screams] - [thuds, clatters] [grunts] [thuds, clatters] [pants] [blade rasps] [grunts] [both grunting] [clanks] - [clinks] - Huh? [both grunting] - [gunshots] - [Steiner groans] - [thuds] - [groans] - [grunts] - [thwacks] - [loud thud] - [groans] [Payu] You. You set this up. [Jaka] I did it to flush them out. You should go. Leave with your friend. [pants] Go. [distant gunshots] - [rapid gunshots] - [groaning] [Xiao Xian gasps] [officer 7 in Thai] Move! Quickly! [panting] [both grunt] [groans] [clanks] [gunshot] [both grunting] - [Jaka grunts] - [thuds] [pants] Don't do it. - [Mook grunts] - [weapon fires] [splatters] [gun clanks] [gasps] [clanking] [chains rattling] [gunshots] [metal clanking] Well, well, well.

Where are ya? [tires screech] Go! [sighs] [engine revs] Mook! Where's Mook? - She's fuckin' dead, all right? - Shit. - [Joey] And Steiner? - [Collins] Steiner, too. This is turning into a real shit show. This is an expensive fuckin' exercise. Who are these fuckin' bush babies you hired anyway? Just local trackers from one of the villages. From like a village of fuckin' ninja warrior land? Jesus Christ! [Devereaux] They have to be down one of these streets. [pants] - [tires screeching] - [Collins] There they are! [woman screams] Guys. Moving! Moving! Move! - Huh? - Wait, what? [gasps] [panting] [Long-Fei] Come on! [Collins] There they fucking are! [Long-Fei] In here! Move! [Joey] Get out of the way! [woman shrieks] Fuckin' move! Down here! [Long-Fei gasps, grunts] [grunts] - [tires screech] - [both] Whoa! - Fuckin' hell! Jesus! - [car horns honking] [tires screeching] - Whoa! - [car horns honking] Shut the fuck up! Fuck off! They're gone! Fuck! [sighs] Now you get the van, get to Devereaux. No way. You meet me at the marketplace there. No, you do as your fuckin' told and get in the van. Who do you think you're talking to, eh? You keep telling me what to do, and you're pissing me off. We're running around the streets with fuckin' machine guns. Look at the eyes on us! How long is it gonna be before the police turn up? You take that, you get to the van, and you do as you're fucking told! [tense music] [in Mandarin] [Lee] Sir. [in Mandarin] Oh. Lee, you've arrived just in time. [ambassador] These are signed. You can send them out. Of course, but I have something urgent to report. What? There has been an attack on the Nagavara Hotel. Are Liang and Xiao Xian safe? Liang is injured. She's in the hospital. Xiao Xian is missing. Missing? Liang believes Xiao Xian must have run to the Chinese Embassy. [Lee] But so far, we haven't heard from her. Get me the Maha Jaya Chief of Police. [cell phone ringing] [in English] Yeah? [Su Feng] You messed up the contract, Collins. Do I need to engage someone else to take care of this? [Collins]Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Su Feng. Everything's under control, all right? [Su Feng] If this is under control, I'd hate to see what out of control looks like. It'll look like me decimating any other team that gets in my way, so back off and let us do our job. You should come and see me. [Collins] Not yet. I'll have this spotless before the sun comes up. I'll come and see you then. - [cell phone beeps] - [clanks] - [officer 8 in Thai] Freeze! - [gun cocks] Put your hands up! [in English] I haven't got time for this. [in Thai] Turn back! Put your hands on your head! [in English] You're makin' a big mistake, pal. [grunting] We're after the same people. We should talk. [Collins] I'm a little busy right now, mate. Drop the gun. [clanks] Stand up. [Collins] What do you want? Let's not play games. I could work with you. I can help you take down the dude that you're after. I'm not looking for an apprentice right now. Thank you very much. Who exactly are they, and what do you want with them? [Jaka] They're mercenaries, like me. I've been after them for years. Looking at your situation, I'd say you need some help. And how exactly do you suppose you're gonna help me? I know my way around the city. And I know the same people they do and how they work. [sighs] Long-Fei and Payu, they also have the girl you're after. Look, if we work together, we can both get what we want. You can certainly handle yourself. Maybe I could use a little bit of local assistance. We better get out of here before his mates turn up don't you? Yeah. [suspenseful music] [Xiao Xian in Mandarin] What were you doing at the police station? [Long-Fei] We were in an underground fight. There may have been some gambling involved. Did you guys win? Of course. We are professionals. And he is? That's Payu. [in English] Payu, thank you for saving me. [in Thai] Thank you. Anytime. [in Mandarin] Can I trust you guys? The police aren't an option. Do you have a choice? [in English] I grew up near here. [tense music] [in Mandarin] Go, go, go. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. [in Mandarin] Get down. What are you doing? You drive. I'll navigate. [Xiao Xian] You realize this is a cop car, right? We're just going to borrow it. You should drive. This is a girl's car. Since when do cars have genders? This is not the time to joke. I'm not joking. I can't drive. What do you mean you can't drive? I mean, I don't know how to drive. You're a professional? How come you can't drive? I'm a professional, just not a professional driver. Shit. Here. [car beeping] [engine rumbles] [engine revving] [officer 9] Hey, my car! Hey, stop! [in Thai] Where are you going? [in English] Look, we'll get the job done, all right? Trust me. It'll be business as usual before... - [line clicks] - Hello? [Collins sighs] So, what's up? Ah, that Su Feng meeting didn't go well. She's even more pissed off than she normally is. [Devereaux] You said you could handle it. [Collins] Yeah. So, what does that mean? Well, it's pretty simple, really. [Collins] We've got 48 hours to execute those little pricks and if we don't, contract reverts to us. Nah, not alcohol. [bottle thuds] [Joey] Jesus. Remind me and the lads why we need you again. All of you are ex-military. Maybe special forces? [Jaka] Martial arts training. But maybe a bit out of shape. You don't know us well enough to be making that kind of statement now, do you? [grunts] You were saying? [Collins] All right, calm down. Devereaux. He's useful. Crew is light anyways, so I say we keep him. [gasps, sighs] Like I said, if you're going after Long-Fei and Payu, you need my help. [snickers] This little motherfucker just doesn't quit, does he? Look, we've got contacts coming out of our asses, mate. Pretty soon, someone somewhere is gonna give her up. She is well-connected in China and has nowhere to go. She will head to the Chinese Embassy. - [tires screech] - [grunts] [in Mandarin] I thought Maha Jaya fixed their traffic problem. [in English] Something is wrong. [Payu] This can't be a coincidence. It has to be them. [ominous music] Can I borrow your phone? Okay. [indistinct chatter] [phone ringing] [in Mandarin] Xiao Xian, where are you? Madame Liang, I hope you're better now. We can see the embassy, but we're stuck behind the roadblock. [Liang] There was a bomb threat at the embassy. We think it was them. It's all blocked. Who are you with? Some new friends. They're helping me out. [in English] I'm moving now. - [engine revving] - [tires screeching] [Collins] Go, go, go! Go. Drive. [in Mandarin] Drive! [tires screech] [Payu in Thai] Faster. Go, go! [gunshots] [yelps] - [gunshots] - Come on! Get back to the van and cut 'em off. [Joey] Yeah, yeah. - [tires screeching] - [engine revving] [panting] [grunts] [townsman] Hey! - [thuds] - [screams] - [grunting] - [shrieking] - [glass shatters] - [shrieks] [groans] - [screams] - [thuds, clatters] [Long-Fei in Mandarin] Are you okay? [in Mandarin] [Xiao Xian] Who is he? [Long-Fei] Not a friend. [grunts] [in English] We have to go. Now! [in Thai] Let me see. [officer 10] Huh? [in Thai] To the center, do you copy? [officer 10] No one's here. Jaka. [in English] They're in the other market. Between Kwang and Kent. - Jaka. - What are you doing? You used us a bait. [Jaka] Be patient, my friend. My fight is with Collins, not you. Just keep moving. [Payu] It's your funeral, man. [tense music] This way! [Jaka] They were here. We just lost them. [Devereaux] And here you are. I followed them from the crash. Lost them in the market. You're always in the right place at the right time, huh? [Jaka] That's why you need me. [Joey] Collins, over here. Good job. You know my gut has kept me alive, sort of like a sixth sense. And you know what my gut is telling me? You're up to something. If you have a point to make, make it. Oh, I will, when the time comes. [sighs] Wait. Stop. [plastic bag rustling] You go that way. I'll sweep 'em towards ya. [Joey] Hold on, mate. Sorry, not open. Health department. I'm the vice terminator. [ominous music] [Xiao Xian panting] - [phone rings] - [gasps] [tense music] [phone rings, stops] [ominous music] [sighs] Looks like you passed the inspection. [relieved sigh] [in Mandarin] The Maha Jaya Police Department is overwhelmed. [ambassador] They can't guarantee Xiao Xian's safety. The search will have to wait until additional support arrives tomorrow. [metal gate rasps, clanks] [in English] Can I see it? Yeah. [Payu groans] [Long-Fei] Looks like we're stuck here for the night. [Xiao Xian] Great. [in Mandarin] Tell me how you know these people? [Long-Fei] We were hired for a humanitarian rescue mission, only it wasn't. Instead, they freed Collins and left us for dead. And who is the guy at the market? He's with the foreigners, but he's one of us. [Long-Fei] It's complicated. Complicated? His people were killed when the camp was destroyed. So, he's a mole? Sort of. [clinks] So the two of you are responsible for this? Now, what? Now, we take cover here for the night. Tomorrow, we can try the embassy again. Sit. I guess you can only call in so many bomb threats. [sucks teeth] [in English] May I take your orders? [Payu in Thai] Hi all. I'm Payu, your chef. Today, I proudly present to you my best dish, stir-fried swamp cabbage! - [chuckles] - [imitates whooshing] It's best served with hot soup, which we're gonna have... Oops... River prawn spicy soup! [in Mandarin] Payu was a field cook. A damn good one. [in English] You like spicy? Ooh. [chuckles] [suspenseful music] [pants] [exhales sharply] [Collins] Let's keep lookin'. - [tires screech] - [engines revs] [in Mandarin] So was it your dad's mission or yours? It was my dad's mission that I embraced. Enough about me. What about you? You two were obviously professionally trained. Why did you leave China? [Long-Fei] When I was young, my father brought me here. We've been living here since then. There's money working security here. One job, two jobs. [Long-Fei] I want to make enough money to bring my father back to China. But now, I cannot go home. Since you saved me, maybe I can help you? I know a lot of people. I'll find a way. [clinks] [in English] Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served. Thank you. For me. Enjoy. [claps] This is actually really delicious. You pick up a lot, moving from place to place. [in Thai] Delicious. [in Cantonese] It's good. If it's good, then eat more. [in Mandarin] That's my beer. The other one's yours. [in English] Of course, you do. All right. [in English] Toast? - [in Mandarin] Cheers. - Cheers? - Mm-hm. - Yeah, cheers. [glasses clink] [all chuckling] [ominous music] We're gonna have every syndicate hit squad in bloody Indochina on our cases if we don't snare these three little imps sometime soon. I am painfully aware of that. It's gonna get a lot more painful if we don't solve this problem... quickly. [foreboding music] [in Mandarin] Dummy. I'm always here. [Jaka in Indonesian]I should never have brought you. I just wanted you with me. I promise that when everything is over and they are dead, I will live my life and make you proud. I will convince them to trust me. I will kill them with my bare hands. [Jaka]I will kill them with my bare hands. On my... terms... at the right time. [smooches] [Jaka]I will face them one by one. [engine revs] [tires screeching] [Xiao Xian in English] Going to the Embassy is a mistake. The cartel will do anything to stop my donation. [Xiao Xian in Mandarin] That's all that matters to me. [in English] I'm the one they're looking for. So give me up. I don't think so. Use me as bait. [Payu] It's too dangerous. Well, we need to come up with some sort of plan. You know this is the only way it could work. She's right. [Payu] I have an idea. - Ah, cheers, mate. - [clinks] Bullshit. Bullshit. Donnie and Sam, okay, cool. [cell phone rings] Ha-ha. If it isn't the man of the hour. [Payu]Let me speak to Collins. Well, I'm pretty sure he'd like to speak with you, too. Hey, Collins, this is precious. You're gonna wanna see this. Well, hello, hello, hello, mate. How's it goin'? How's your feet? They hurtin'? Yeah, I fuckin' hope so. I have something you want. Let's talk. [Collins] We're talkin' now, champ. We have Xian. You want her? Oh, well, fuck me, I was not expecting that. - It's bullshit, bro. - Wait, wait. Let's see what he's gotta say. What you got in mind, my little friend? [Payu]Dawn, at the old Polo club. You get what you want, I get $100,000 and our freedom. A hundred thousand dollars, eh? Yeah, all right. [Collins] Got yourself a deal. But do me favor, don't be late. - I've got a deadline to meet. - [phone beeps] Now you know he's trying to set us up, right? Don't tell me you trust that little bastard. No, I don't trust him. But I do trust that they'll be there whether they're settin' us up or not. So I say we use all the cash we got left. You find me as many shooters as you can wrangle. - Shooters? - [Collins] Yeah. Ugly motherfuckers with guns who get paid to kill people. - I know what shooters are. - Well, good. We get there early. We don't fuck about. We set a few little traps. And instead of negotiating the trade, we fuckin' annihilate these little pricks, now how's that for trust? [Joey] Well, it's about time, 'cause I'm sick of playin' fuckin' hide-and-seek. [ominous music] Welcome back, Payu. [boss] Let's talk inside. [foreboding music] [boss] Why are you here, Payu? You callin' in your marker? What makes you think I would honor it? You are many things, but... I know you keep you word. You haven't told your friends about our past, have you? How you earned your name. [scoffs] [big boss] Payu, the tempest. One that destroys all that it touches. Not everything I did was good. He worked with me. [boss] Killed 12 men in one attack. I can't say they didn't deserve it. - Then he left. - No, no, no. - [boss] Next thing you know, - Stop. He's a soldier of fortune working far and wide. Enough! You owe me. What do you want, Payu? [Payu] I need weapons. [foreboding music] [lights flickering] Take what you want. [boss] We're square. [intense music] Your donation's not gonna change anything. You remove one regime and another takes its place. [boss] You need to stay alive to make a difference. Do you have anything more substantial? [thuds] [Payu] Get in. Okay. [boss] Payu! Don't forget what I said. We're even. [engine rumbling] [tense music] So, we're gonna take care of these little shits and get back to business. This is business right now. [Devereaux] Split into pairs. Get into position. Cover the main area. All right? Go! This ends tonight. [gun cocks] Ah, used one of those before, haven't you? You know, you look like somebody who, uh, knows their guns. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, what are you anyway, man? - Cambodian? Vietnamese? - [sighs] Indonesia. Indonesian! Indonesian! Yeah, yeah, man. [Devereaux] We ran into some Indonesians. Up in the north. Yeah, they were being used as camp security. Yeah, yeah. They were terrible. We deep sixed 'em all. [Devereaux] Left 'em in the sun to bloat and feed the flies. That doesn't bother you, does it? Wouldn't be anyone you knew, right? [Devereaux] C'mon, speak up. We all on the same team. Huh? Get off my back. I'll get off your back. I just thought it was something that you wanted to get off your little chest. Your shooters clear on what we expect from them, Devereaux? Yeah, I got eight guns pointed at me right now. All right, good. Let's get this done. [ominous music] [foreboding music] [foreboding music continues] Where's the other mouseketeer? He's outside, making sure we weren't followed. [Collins] Is he? Well, that's all right. We had the same idea, didn't we? Your team double-crossed us. Left us for dead. They did. But that was then, this is now. So are we gonna do this or what? - [muffled gunshots] - [both groaning] [gasps, pants] [muffled gunshot] [Collins] There's your money in that case... just like we agreed. - [grunting] - [men groaning] [bones cracking] [panting] Why don't you come over here, darlin'? [Collins] Don't worry. Promise I'll make it quick. Do you remember the first time you felt your soul slipping away? [Collins] My soul? [snickers] No, there's no souls here, sweetheart. [Collins] Just a bunch of blokes doin' our jobs like everyone else. - [muffled gunshot] - [groans] [Collins] Now granted, wasn't exactly what I wanted to be doing when I was all grown up, but you know what? Turned out I was pretty bloody good at it. [Collins] There's you money, just like I agreed. The girl, send her over. The girl! Now! [rapid gunshots] [groans] [shrieks] [rapid gunshots] [gun cocks] [in Mandarin] Aim the gun, pull the trigger, until it's empty. [in Mandarin] Got it. [gun cocks] [gunshots] - [gun clicks] - Shit. [gun cocks] [ominous music] [rapid gunshots] [rapid gunshots continue] [thuds] The Indonesians you killed were my people. [Jaka] I buried my wife because of you. This is personal. [rapid gunshots] [clanks] That's the dumbest thing you're never gonna live to regret. Let's see. [grunts] [tense music] - [thwacks] - [both grunting] - [thuds] - [grunts] [rapid gunshots] [Joey] Come on, you rat boss! - [grunts] - [loud thud] - [groans] - [clatters] [both grunting] [rapid gunshots] - [thwacks] - [grunting] - [thwacks] - [Devereaux groans] [panting] [grunts] - [groaning] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [gunshot] [thuds] [knife rasps] Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this. [Joey] Come on! Let's see what you got. - [knife clanging] - [both grunting] [loud thud] - [grunts] - [exhales] [both grunting] - [thudding] - [groans] [grunting] [tense music] [rapid gunshots] [spits] [both grunt] - [thwacks] - [thuds] [grunts] [Jaka groans] [grunting] [rumbles] [pants] [tense music] [creaking] [both grunting] - [thuds] - [groans] Not bad for a little man. Does it have to be this way? I'm afraid it does. We finish this right fuckin' here! [both grunting] [thwacks] [cracks] - [thuds] - [groans] [both grunting] [gasps] [Devereaux] You'll be seeing your wife soon. Shh. [gasping] - [Long-Fei grunts] - [thwacks] [Devereaux grunting] [thuds, clatters] - [thuds] - [Devereaux groans] [squelches] [phone rings] [in Mandarin] Hello? Who is this? [male voice in Indonesian] Tian Xiao Xian is at the abandoned Polo club. Send somebody to rescue her. - [line drops] - [in Mandarin] Hello? Hello? Hello? [gun cocks] [rapid gunshots] [Payu groans] [clanks] [both grunting] [thuds] [grunting] [both grunting] - [Payu screams] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [Collins groans] [both panting] [in English] You know, you're a pretty good fighter. [Collins] I'm gonna teach you a lesson. Talk, talk, talk. [both grunting] - [thwacks] - [Payu groans] Now look at you. You're weak and pathetic. [screaming] [groaning] You sneaky, little bastard! [pants] I should've listened to Devereaux, shouldn't I? He's dead, as you will be soon. Well, I reckon I fancy these odds anyway. [grunting] - [thuds] - [Jaka groans] [loud thud] Come on there, village boy. [yells] [thwacking] - [thuds] - [Payu groaning] [rumbles, clatters] [thrilling music] [both grunting] - [thuds] - [Jaka groans] [thuds, clatters] [Xiao Xian] Jaka? Jaka! [pants, gasps] [foreboding music] [Collins] You pissed off some really important people, girl. For that, you have my respect. Uh-uh. Drop it. [snickers] Slide it over. [Collins] Slide it over! [rasping] It's about time I cash my paycheck, don't you think? - [Long-Fei grunts] - [gunshot] [gun clicks] [clanks] Jesus Christ! Why the fuck is it so hard to kill one little Chinese girl? [suspenseful music] You left me for dead... twice. It will not happen again. [clanks] [groans] [pants] [blows air] You come and have a go, if you think you're hard enough. [both grunting] [spits] [both grunting] [cracks knuckles] [both grunting] - [thuds] - [Collins groans] - [whooshes] - [thuds] [groaning] [rasps] [Payu groaning] [thwacking] [grunting] - Is that all you got? Huh? - [groans] You shoulda stayed in the pits! Less talk, just die. [thuds] - [thwacks] - [Collins groans] [grunting] [rasps] [groans, screams] - [blood sloshes] - [groans] - [yells] - [thuds] Talk, talk, talk. No more talk. [thrilling music] [ominous music] [clanking] - [gun cocks] - [Xiao Xian gasps] [gunshots] [gun clicking] - [Xiao Xian gasps] - [Long-Fei] That's enough. He's dead. Are you sure? Thank you. [groans] [groans, pants] [brake squeals] Xiao Xian. [in Mandarin] We were worried sick. We came as soon as we got Jaka's phone call. [Xiao Xian] Jaka? [Liang] I have some good news. We've arrested the person responsible. She's being extradited to Singapore. [officer 11 in Thai] Stop right there. You're under arrest. Get up. [shackles click] [gasps, sighs] [in English] I told you... I had a plan. Good plan. We almost died. Next time, you get shot. [laughing] [Xiao Xian in Mandarin] Bye. [in English] See you, man.
