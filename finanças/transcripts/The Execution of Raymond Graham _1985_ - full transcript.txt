[ people shouting ] [ music playing ] Man: 46... 47... 48... 49... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... 16. My record! 117. 118. 19, 120. Ooh! Yeah! A lotta guys in here let themselves go. They don't take care of themselves. Me, I got this routine, push-ups every day. I do a set in the morning and another at night. Some men find it difficult to discipline themselves. Not me. Not me. Hey, Padre? Prison chaplain: Hmm? Ain't you gonna try and save me? I wasn't planning to. If you want we can talk about it. Raymond: No. Farrah says you're gettin' a pretty big crowd out there. Son of a bitches. A lotta them are on your side. Yeah. Well, who needs 'em. All I care about is the nine on the Supreme Court. But then, you only need five. Ain't that right? Just give me five of 'em. Hey, Padre. Gimme five! Come on! Aah! Of course you really only need one, huh? You can always get one. I got my lawyers. They did it three times before. They'll do it again. - Hi, Richie. - Richie: Hi. How you doin'? I'm okay. A little nervous, I guess. How about coffee? Great. How you doin'? Oh! Damn it! Come here. Here. I'm making you a promise... tonight. Right after tonight. I'm putting it behind me. Getting on with my life. No more demons. That's good. I hope so. I know you've been wanting me to and up to now I've been trying. I know you have. I'm not sure you know how hard I've been trying. But there are so many questions that I still don't have an answer to. What if Kevin hadn't taken a job in that place to begin with? What if he'd taken the job with me? What if...? What if? Anyway, no more after tonight. You hungry? Not really, but I'll walk over to the coffee shop with you, if you'd like. Are you coming to the prison with me? Nope. Jim: You sure? You know I don't want to see it. I'd like it if you'd come. How's my tie? You look good. - You ready? - Yeah. Man on TV: Okay, okay, folks, the next try will be in two hours. Man #2: Russ, you gotta get him to quit tellin' them terrible jokes. He can get hurt. Man: It was still in the cans. Man #2: Stop him. [ TV chatter continues indistinctly ] Man on TV: I really wowed them, didn't I? You want me to get you some more coffee, Ma? You sure? Jean packed some meatloaf sandwiches. Carol, if she doesn't want to eat... What time is it? It's eight past 9:00. What time are they gonna let you see Ray? They told me to be there by 10 of, so I figured I'd leave about 9:30. Get me a coffee, okay? And one for Mom in case she changes her mind. [ TV chatter continues ] Uh, I got applications in at Duke, Wisconsin, and Stanford. John: Aimin' high. Is geography important to you? How do you mean? One's east, one's west, one's in the middle. Well, you know, they're all good schools, and they're all... - Far away. - Yeah. How do your folks feel? It's all right with Mom, but Dad, he'd like me closer. What're you gonna major in? I don't know, science, maybe pre-med. I thought maybe art. You've always had a talent for it. No, I'm not good enough. You gotta study years to be an artist. But you have to study years to be a doctor. That's what Kevin was gonna be, wasn't it? Yeah. Thank you. Mary: Did you get any rest, sweetheart? Richie: I went for a walk. Mary: Oh, I wish you'd called me. I could've used some air. Where'd you go? I went down that way. There's nothing there but bars and porno movie houses, so I came right back. And have you made up your mind yet whether you're coming with me or staying with your mother? Are you gonna stay here with Mom, Uncle John? Yes. You do what you want. I'd just be glad for the company. Then I'll come with you, Dad. Ready, folks? Nothing for me. Thanks. No, thanks. Coffee. Uh, decaffeinated, if you have it. Oh, decaffeinated, yes, sir. Are you packed up? I want to go back tonight, right after. We'll stop outside Dunstan, gas up, get some coffee, and be home in time for breakfast. Dad, what if he gets another stay? Is this anybody's first time? Mine and Fred's, and I'm not looking forward to it. It's still on for 11:00. You cited Paulie, what does he want? If he gives us more time, we-- 48 hours. 24 hours! All right. I know, I know... Did you call Joseph in Washington? I haven't heard a thing. Now, and you know where I am. I thought we had all this behind us, but the people, in their wisdom, think this is the right thing to do. They should all be here to see it. How've you been, Max? You know, I haven't seen you since the hearing at the capital. How's your wife? It's, uh, Sarah, isn't it? Oh, you've got a good memory. She's fine. Just became a grandmother. First time? Fourth. Questions okay, Mr. Adler? Where are you? In trouble. Circuit court turned us down, we're at the Supreme Court now. Well, how about the governor? I saw him yesterday. He's not interested. - We're trying another way. - What's that? Someone who couldn't possibly be more ineffective with him than I was. So how do you feel? Personally? Sorry, what I mean is after 13 years of no executions, - here comes another one-- - No. No, no, he's not "another one." His name is Raymond Alan Graham. He's 28 years old. He's a human being, no better than most, no worse than some. He's got a mother a brother and a sister. Call for you, Mr. Adler. Yeah? I'm at a gas station. I've got a flat tire. Don't get it fixed, buy a new one, and I'll pay for it. Listen, I can't find him. I want you to write these numbers down. Hold on. I gotta get something to write with. Shoot. Arthur Wyman, 555-7981, Jerry Cox, 555-4826, Ilene O'Brien. I've got no number on this, just a street address. 321 South Hudson. I'll try Cox from here. You try the others, and if you strike out, get back to me damn quick. Your move, Padre. Here to here. [ footsteps approaching ] - Good evening, Chaplain. - Good evening, Warden. - Evening, Ray. - Warden. How you feelin'? Oh, not too bad. How's about yourself? How you holdin' up? - All right. - First time for both of us, huh? Of course, uh, I have a little more at stake than you do. Uh, Warden, uh, I hope you got somebody sittin' up in your office. I hate to miss that phone call when it comes in. Mr. Hoffman is there. He'll let us know if anything comes in. Meanwhile, I think we'd better get ready. Yeah, guess we don't want to keep anybody waitin'. Two five. Anything you want to take care of before you go down, Ray? Uh, Henry, you still want that heater? Henry: Sure do, man. How about you, DiSilva? You still want those books? DiSilva: Yeah. 'Take anything you got. Hey, thanks, man. Remember the deal. I get it back if I come back. Plus two packs of smokes. You got it. You're makin' a sucker bet. Take care of yourself. - See you in hell, pal. - I don't doubt it. Warden, I got some personal stuff here. A picture of me and some other stuff. You'll, uh, send it to my mother, huh? Warden: I'll see to it that she gets it. Is she gonna be up tonight? Yeah. Yeah, whole family come up. At the motel. Warden: Good. Well, I guess we better get going. Yeah. Let's go. - Brad. - Yes, sir. A long time since I've been out at night. So, Warden, how does it feel, bein' your first time and all? I guess I've come to terms with it. What does that mean? Part of the job being a warden. Personally, I'd hoped this day would never come. It hasn't come yet. At least you're not like the people on the outside. What would you do with me? Well, I wouldn't want you on the street. - Life without parole probably. - Right. There is business of putting people to death, I just don't think it does what they think it does. If 50 years of life imprisonment doesn't stop you, why would the death penalty? Right. What? That's it, huh? All right. [ door buzzes ] It's Warden Pratt. - You ready, Richie? - Yeah. Jim: I really appreciate you being here, John. It helps. We're gonna be late. 'You gonna be all right? I'm fine. I'm just sick to my stomach Richie's going. I don't know. My whole idea is Richie's got to start making his own decisions. So, all right, he made it. I think you felt caught between Jim wanting him to come and you wanting him not to. He's so sensitive. This is not gonna be like watching some horror movie from the second balcony. He maybe stronger than you think. It takes as much courage to go as not to. You still feel like some air? I'd love some. Which way weren't we supposed to walk? That way. Get this down to the front desk. Make sure it's properly tagged. Jimmy, you go. - Comfortable, Ray? - Just like home. Well, I'm gonna have to be getting on back now. The call comes in, either way, I'll come down and let you know. If you feel like it, there's a phone there, you can call your mother. I see Officer Coombs has made a fresh pot of coffee. There's plenty of cool drinks in the refrigerator. Anything else I can get for ya? Yeah. Beer and a pardon? I'm afraid I'm gonna have to say, no to the beer. The pardon is just not my department. Is that clock right? Yeah, 9:24, right on the button. Jesus. [ television playing ] Is the TV bothering you, Mama? I can turn it off, if you want. I'm goin' over there now, Mama. You give my hand a good squeeze... I'm going with you. Are you sure? Now, yesterday we didn't think you going was such a good idea. I want to see him. I want to see my baby. And he wants to see you too, but, Mama, don't you think it'll be too hard on you? - I do. - I want to see him just once more. Ray thought that if you were there you'd both just cry so much. You said good-bye to him once. Now, I promise, nothing's gonna happen to him until after you get to talk to him on the phone. Carol will stay right here with you. I got to go now. - Now, I'll call you when I can. - You got the number? Yeah, it's on the matches. Don't leave her alone, okay? Why don't you lie down, Mama? Get a little rest. My mom talked about comin', but, uh, I didn't think it was such a good idea. I don't know. Maybe I should've let her come. 'She been up to see you pretty regularly? Yeah, yeah. Except for the time Vic broke his leg, he couldn't drive. Every month. You know, what they are doing to me, I asked for it, but what did she ever do? Except to have me. A lot of the men have their families turn their backs on 'em. No mail, no visits... DiSilva. DiSilva, next to me, upstairs, eight years not one visit, not one letter, nothin'. My mother always wrote me. Sent me few extra bucks, and came up to see me. It was hard for her too. Is she alone? Now my brother and sister moved out. My sister... She's a pain in the ass. She never gave a damn about me. She never came up to see me. She never even wrote. Nothin'. Nothin'. A real princess. Real bitch. It's probably my own fault. I was a real handful and a half growing up. Is she older or younger? Two years younger. She always said that, uh, I was gonna kill Mama with my way, she predicts like that. She should have gone in the stock market, we would all be... rich. But my ways. My ways aren't gonna get anybody killed but me. What does she do? She married this guy who runs a restaurant. She took care of his books. They got two little kids I ain't never even seen. Born after I got in here. I'm gonna go get some more. You want some? Nah. Hey! I'm gonna meet my brother later. - Vic? - Yeah, he's a good guy. He paints houses. I could've been his partner. Oh? Why didn't ya? I don't know. Forty hours standin' on a ladder. I couldn't stand the smell of paint. By that time, I'd been in and out of things so much it was too late, you know? Is that what your dad did? No, he, uh... I don't know, he might have, he did a lot of things. Construction worker, merchant marine, odd jobs like that. I don't know, he might have done some painting. I don't know, I was pretty young when he took off. Prison chaplain: How young? Seven, eight, nine. Why did he take off? Who knows? He came into my room. Mine and Vic's the night he took off... smellin' of booze, wakin' us up, and tellin' us, he couldn't take it anymore. He-- he had to get away. He was goin' back on the road. I don't know, he might have. I think I, uh, dreamed it. Ever see him? I don't know if he's dead or alive. Ever tried to find him? He knew where we lived. You know, I thought, uh... I thought maybe he'd read about me after I got into this, and he'd try to get in touch with me and tell me he was sorry. Sorry that he'd walked out on us. Sorry for the jam I was in. Never did. Ah! Screw him and the horse he rode in on. I guess a lot of the men upstairs had fathers who'd died or disappeared when they were young. Yeah, right. And a lot of guys' fathers took off early, and they never got into trouble at all. Sir, can I ask you about your interest in this case? - Do you have any involvement-- - Hey! Here he comes! [ people cheering ] I never thought I'd be first, man. Jackson has been waiting twelve and a half years. You believe that? I mean, I'm, uh-- I'm an amateur. You know how long I've been in? Five years upstairs, but all told, eleven. What was the first time? First time I got in trouble? Mm-hmm. First time I got caught I was 12. Hangin' out with some older guys. We took a car. Reformatory? No, I went there the second time. What did you do? I took a car for myself. - You like cars, huh? - Mm-hmm. Well, yeah. I like all the regular stuff. Cars, girls, and rock 'n roll. Did you ever have a girlfriend? Uh, nobody really steady. I was never out long enough. My, uh, sister. She had some friends. And there was this one I kind of liked. Real cute blonde. And she used to wear this fuzzy purple sweater and white skirt. She was tall, skinny, kind of quiet, but she was afraid of me. Otherwise, I don't know, I might have asked her out. She was shy. I was kind of shy myself. Oh, really? Yeah, I... I didn't know how to act around girls. No brains. You seem smart enough to me. Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean, uh, no education. What did you do on the outside? Hung around, drank beer, got loaded. You don't feel so stupid when you're loaded. Ever have a job? Yeah, I did some delivery boy stuff, but what were they ever gonna give me? How'd you live? You mean, uh, what did I do for cash? Prison chaplain: Mm-hmm. Gimme the money. Hey, everybody's gotta make a living, right? Is that what landed you upstairs the first time? Yeah, armed robbery and assault. Prison chaplain: How old were you? 19. [ door buzzes ] - Doctor: Where is he? - Doctor. You can stay, Padre, I'll just be a minute. Raymond Alan Graham? That's me. Doc Vogel. You could have asked, jerk. Sorry, I had to check. You were a user on the outside. Yeah, well, if you'd read my jacket, I guess you'd know. Vogel: I'm just trying to help you, son. I don't need your kind of help. What I'm trying to tell you is that some drug habits increases your tolerance to other drugs. Yeah? Well, I took pills. What kind? Reds, 'ludes, what do you want? The whole drugstore? What about smack, speedballs? I wasn't a shooter. That's all I wanted to know. Oh, here's a donor card. It means you'd like to give your eyes or other organs to... I ain't dead yet! I still got a chance. We're waiting for a phone call, you know. It's a part of the procedure, Ray. Keep the card. Think about it. You don't have to sign it if you don't want to. Well, good luck. Hey, look, listen. Listen, uh... You got somethin' to steady a guy's nerves? Nobody told me what it's like. It's not painful. That's a bunch of crap. It's gotta hurt somewhere. What's gonna happen? Medic puts a catheter and a vein in each arm. One's it, one's a back-up. Which arm's gonna get it? Left. Then the second medic, you won't be able to see him, starts a flow of standard saline solution. When the word is given, he'll start the Sodium thiopental. that's an anesthetic. Twice the normal amount. If you don't fight it, it works pretty fast. That's it? That's all it is? Well, there's two back-up drugs. Pavulon will relax the muscles, paralyze the breathing. Potassium Chloride to stop the heart. God Almighty. They don't fool around, do they? Are you the one that's gonna do it? Raymond: Why not? I'm a doctor. It would violate my oath against taking a life. But you set it up. You put the bullets in the guns, but you give it to somebody else to shoot, huh? Is that it, Doc? Good night, Padre. I'll hold on to this for ya. ♪ We shall overcome ♪ We shall overcome someday ♪ Oh deep in my heart ♪ I do believe ♪ That we shall overcome someday ♪ ♪We'll walk hand in hand ♪We'll walk hand in hand... Sign in, sir. Mr. Neal is here. It'll be just a moment, sir. You can wait over there. - Mr. Neal? - Yes? I'm Assistant Warden Hoffman. Now, Warden Pratt has been delayed, and he asked if you'd please wait in his office? Do you know what it's about? Is there some problem? The warden didn't say, sir. There hasn't been a new stay? I really don't know. It's probably some kind of formality. Papers to sign or something. Could you just follow me please? I didn't know it was this bad. He moved into the upstairs guest room three years ago. 26 years in one bed gone with the wind. Does he ever come in? Once in a while. Just to be polite. I get the feeling. You remember what he was like when we got married? Sure. And you liked him, didn't you? Right from the start? Sure did, and so did Mom and Dad. What a man he was, what a man he used to be. So warm, so loving and sexy. Oh, boy! He was my first. And last. It's pretty rough, huh, kid? The clock stopped for him six years ago. You know how he was with Kevin. Your kids are what you live for. They are your connection with life, and he just stopped living. Last week I saw Jim in Kevin's old room. I walked in, he jumped up, took a swipe at his eyes. Laughed, you know, embarrassed, and didn't want to talk about it. It's not doing Richie any good either, living in a funeral parlor. He says he's goin' away to college. He better if he wants a life of his own. I wish we saw more of him here. Just living over thousand miles away... I know. I know. Johnny, you'll never believe this. About a month ago, I went to see Richie at a swimming meet at the high school, and the whole time I was looking through the crowd of kids for Kevin. Damn Raymond Graham! He didn't just take my son away from me, took my whole, damn family. Damn Raymond Graham. - Clerk: Mr. Adler? - Yeah? - Call from Washington, sir. - All right. Adler. All right. All right, you tried. Nobody else could've done it either. Thanks. No, no, I mean it. Thanks. Well, we've got one chance left, and that's it. Yeah. It's the governor or nothing. Doesn't look good, does it? There's still time. Not much. You for it, Padre? Executin' me? That's a tough question. Raymond: What's the answer? It's not just an eye for an eye, um, or anything else that the Bible might say. What I believe is that every man has a responsibility to all other men. Each man trusts the other not to steal from him or hurt him in any way. That's what makes us civilized, that we agree to live by rules. When someone doesn't, there have to be penalties for breaking that trust. Even if it means killing people? Prison chaplain: I think so. And you're supposed to be a man of God. That's somethin'. That really is. If it's wrong for me to kill you, it's just as wrong for you to kill me. Legalized murder, that's all it is. I've heard that said. Just seems very different to me. The difference between living by the rules and breaking them. And you've got God on your side? Prison chaplain: I'm just telling you what I personally believe. You know what I did? Prison chaplain: Killed somebody. A kid, 17. Did you mean to? Raymond: Never even knew him. I told him to keep his hands up where I could see 'em after he gave me the money. He put 'em back under the counter. He started to, anyway. He moved his hands after I told him not to. - Did you think he had a gun? - He could have. Did he? No. Officer Coombs. Yes, sir, I'll tell him. Warden's on his way down. Did he say anything? Did he say anything about a stay? Coombs: Just that he's on his way down. No, he must have said somethin'. You're holdin' out on me, man. Coombs: No, I'm not. Prison chaplain: Ray, you have to be prepared for whatever news-- This is it, Padre. Otherwise why's he comin' down? If there was a stay, he would've just said so over the phone. - Ray, you gotta-- - This is it, Padre, They're gonna do it to me. I can feel it. [ door buzzes ] It's Warden Pratt. Ray, I told you that as soon as a call came in, I would come down and tell you. I'm just sorry the news couldn't have been better. Did they turn me down? I'm sorry, Ray. I was countin' on you. You said you could do it. Here's a letter you wrote me. You said you could do it. I said we'd try. You said that all we needed was one judge. - One judge out of nine. - We couldn't get that one. Well, what about the governor? We're trying to reach him. What do you mean "trying"? I went to him yesterday, he turned me down. I've got somebody else trying to reach him this very moment. Maybe there's a chance that she can get him to change his mind. She? A woman? Mr. Adler: A lawyer who works with me. How much of a chance? Ray, I'm not gonna try to kid you. You know this man's record as well as I do. He's in favor of the death penalty. Now, if we could only get him to see what as an individual, as a person, and not as an issue. Don't gimme this crap, man! Not, not now. There are guys in population who've done a lot of worse things than I ever did, who are gonna be out on parole in a couple of years. How am I gonna get parole from a grave? I truly am sorry, Ray. So am I, Warden. So am I. I'll be upstairs by the phone. You said you could do it! - He, he said... - Prison chaplain: Ray... No. Man: It's on the radio. He's gonna get it. Sign in, sir. Mr. Adler said he'd like to see you, and there's a gentleman in the waiting room. Thank you. - Uh, Mr. Graham? - Yes? Bob Collesner. Croydon and Larwen funeral homes. Oh, you're the one I talked to. Yes, sir. Well, we haven't decided yet. It'll probably be cremation, I'll know after I talk to him. Well, that's all right, sir. Oh, there's no rush, you can just call us and, uh, let us know. - Mr. Neal. - Yes. Cecil Pratt. Sorry to keep you waiting. I had a few things to take care of. - This is my son, Richard. - How do you do, Richard? - How do you do? - Please have a seat. All those people out there... Now, this is one of those things that people who have no connection with at all feel totally involved with. Seems to affect them in some deep, personal way. Now, if you don't mind, Mr. Neal, I'll just ask you a few questions, and then I'll describe the procedure to you? - Is there some news? - No, nothing special. From your letter, I wasn't sure that Richard would be going in. - Yes, sir. - You want to be a witness? - Yes, sir. - How old are you? 18, uh, last month. - You're in high school? - Yes, sir. Going to college? Good. Raymond Graham shot your brother, Kevin. Were you close? Well, yes, sir. He was older, of course, six years, but he was great. He was really great. Must've been very hard on you, Yes, sir. Mr. Pratt, excuse me, but I don't think I see where you're going with all this. - It's okay, Dad, I don't mind. - Well, I do. Now, with all due respect, I don't see how our personal feelings are any of your concern. Well, Mr. Neal, let me try and say why I think they are. I'm concerned because, once we go into that room and the door is closed, there's no turning back. And it's important that the procedure not be disrupted in any way. You can understand that? So, Richard, let me ask you directly, are you prepared to watch Raymond Graham being put to death? I want to be there with Dad when it happens. Do either of you have any questions? - Does Ray know? - Yeah. How'd he take it? Disappointed, angry, scared. No. Is there a chance for any kind of change? As far as the courts are concerned, no. What about the governor? We're trying to reach him now, but... chances are one in a million. Well, I really didn't expect another stay. Mama was still holdin' out some hope. To tell you the truth, I was too. I guess she's gotta know. It wouldn't be right not to tell her. I don't know, maybe it's better just to let it happen instead of knowin' and waitin'. Well, if you decide to call her, you can use that phone. I'm going into the other room. Look, uh, I just want to say we appreciate everything you've done. - Yeah? - It's me. Put Mama on. - Is it Ray? - No, it's Vic, Mama. - What's goin' on? - Nothin'. Put Mom on. - Have you seen him yet? - Carol, put Mom on, okay? - It's Vic. - Vic? - Hi, Mama, I'm here. - Have you seen Ray? Uh, no, that won't be for a while yet. Have you heard from the judge? No, no, we're still waiting and hoping, but, uh, so far we haven't heard anything. Well, that's good, isn't it? Well, I hope so. You know, they're being careful, anyway. Well, look, Mama, I don't want to tie up the phone here. I'll call you when I can, okay? Bye, Mama. Vic? What'd he say, Mama? What'd Vic say? I should've gone with 'em, I should've been with 'em. No, wouldn't have done any good. Mama, Vic's right. It would've hurt too much. My baby. What am I going to do without my baby? I hope this never happens to you. What? What'd you say? What's happening to me tonight, I hope it never happens to you. Well, I hope to God it never does either. What would possess you to say something like... You always had such an attitude. What do you mean? What about? Oh, you know what about, you know what I mean. - I honestly do not. - Oh-ho-ho, how about, your own brother Raymond? You never liked him. - I never liked him? - Never. - I never liked Ray? - Never. All right, what was there to like about him? Tell me, what was so wonderful about Ray? He was a mean little bastard. You stop that. He was, Mama. For as long as I can remember. He'd tease me, he'd hide my things, he'd hit me or pinch me whenever you weren't looking, steal my allowance so he can go downtown and get his shoe shined, showoff in front of all my friends. Big deal. Oh, brothers always tease their little sisters. Why do you have to defend him all the time? Why can't you remember he stole you blind? Mama, he stole money from your dresser. Every time the phone would ring it's the juvenile hall calling up to say he'd stolen a car or he grabbed an old lady's purse. Why can't you just see him for what he was? Jesus, Mama. What little girl doesn't want to love her brother? Did you ever-- ever go to see him? Did you ever send him a letter? Did you ever send him money? Up here in prison? By then, it was too late. By then, who cared? Mother: Well, I certainly did. You walking around the house in your dirty bathrobe all day long crying about how you were so sad and all alone and needed us, how Ray had to be the big man in the family. Hugging him and kissing him and breathing on him all the time. No wonder he ran around with the older boys. He had to, to get away from you. Ray never had to get away from me. You're so mean, telling all those lies. I'm going to tell Vic. Tell him whatever you want, he knows it all anyway. Oh, please, please, let's not fight, not tonight. I know how upset you are, you being his little sister and all that. I'm so sad. I'm so sad. Miss O'Brian? Wait. - You are Eileen O'Brian? - Yes. I'm representing Raymond Graham, I've been desperately trying to find the governor. Well, didn't Max Adler see him yesterday? Since then, the courts have turned down our last appeal. I've been calling around for hours but no one seems to know where he is. Do you know? Will you help me? I'm desperate, Ms. O'Brian, there's not much time. He's having dinner with friends. Can you tell me where? They're going to do it in half an hour. All I want is five minutes, please. He's at Rory Todd's in Fairburn Hills. Let me see, you go down to McHadden and take the first left. When you get to the bridge, stay to the right... I'm sorry I don't know this area at all, could you take me? Come on, follow us. It's nice he let us wait here instead of downstairs. Something I never told you before, I wasn't a very good father for Kevin. Ah, come on, Dad. No, in fact I was a lousy father. He was having trouble with math in the second grade, I was supposed to help him. What's five and two I ask? Seven. Okay. What's two and five? [ chuckles ] He didn't know, He guessed six. Now, come on, what's five and two? Seven. Okay, what's two and five? Nine? He just looked at me with his big eyes. Damn it, if five and two is seven what's two and five, what's it got to be? He couldn't see it, I lost my temper, I yelled at him, "Damn it, you're not stupid, you"-- Why'd I do that? Poor little fellow, why'd I do that? It didn't mean anything. Dad, it didn't mean anything it was that one time. I wish you'd yell at me like that sometimes. What? At least you were involved with Kevin, you cared. What are you talking about? Dad, you're so obsessed with Kevin. It's been over six years. Life goes on, you know. You've got another son. I think about Kevin, a lot. Of course I do, who wouldn't? He was my son. But that doesn't mean, doesn't mean that you aren't important too. Ray, I think it's time for that phone call now. This is the hard part. Padre, you think you can do this? Yeah. Hello? - Hi, Mama. - Ray? It's me, Mama. - Hi, baby. - Hi, Mama. Mama, the judge turned me down. That means they're gonna do it. Oh. Mama, you have to understand, nobody can change what's gonna happen. You have-- you have to understand that. I'm trying Ray, but it's hard. I know it is, Mama. But you gotta try. Mother: I will. Mama, I want to tell you I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you. You were never any trouble. Raymond: Yes, I was, Mama, all the time, and if I could make it up to you, I would. I know you would, Ray. Mama, is Carol there? Can I talk to her? Yes, yes I'll put her on. Honey, he wants to talk to you. Hey, Ray. Hey, Carol, how you doing? I'm okay. How about you? Ohh! I'm hanging in there Listen, Carol, I wanted to say goodbye to you. And Harold and the kids. And tell you that, I'm sorry for everything. I am sorry too, Ray. I really am. We just never... made it easy on each other. You know, I just wanted to say... that I wish I had been nicer to you. Carol, you were a good sister. You were. I wish I had been nicer to you too. Thanks for coming up tonight, Carol. Okay. You were a good brother, and I going to put Mom on the phone now. Bye, Ray. Goodbye, Carol. - Ray? - Mama? Listen, Mama, I want you to know that I'm going to be all right now. I am. You see, because after this is over, no one's ever going to be able to hurt me again, Mama. Oh, I don't want you hurt. I know that. And, Mama, I wanted to thank you for everything you did for me. You've been the best Mama I could've had. I love you, baby. I love you too, Mama. But it's, uh, getting time to go now. - No, Ray. - No, I have to say goodbye now, Mama. No, Ray, I've got to tell-- Oh, uh, that was the hard part. I'm glad I made up with my sister. What time is it? Eighteen minutes after ten. Padre, you want to see if my brother's here? Sure, uh, I'll just be a few minutes, Ben. How about a cold one? Coming up. Raymond: You get paid extra for this? No, it's my regular shift. I used to work days, but I decided I liked nights better. There's not so many bosses around. Things are usually quieter. You, uh, get what you wanted for supper? Oh, they fixed me something special but I couldn't eat. I sometimes think about what I'd ask for. I could never make up my mind what it is I'd want. Actually, I'd order myself a hotdog and French fries. Sounds good to me. Let's just go down to the corner and get us one. Nice if we could. You got it under control. You'll do okay. You've seen it before? Long time ago. When they had the chair. Is that it? Warden had it crated up. This way they got now, it's the best way. Hey, Coombs, do you believe in heaven and hell? I do. I've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior. Yeah, well, I wouldn't ask for religion now, even if I wanted it. You think I'm going to hell? Bible says that every man's judgment comes from the Lord. Only He knows that. You're doing a better job than the Padre, he better watch out. Does this, uh, always go smooth? Oh, yeah. In the old days with the electric chair, once or twice we had problems. Vogel: I guess you both know Warden Pratt, Sal Rodriguez, Bill Fallon. Since this is the first time for everybody, the warden wanted to make sure that everyone is familiar with the procedure. Now which of you is going to be administering these drugs? I am, I'll be in the room behind the glass with Warden Hoffman, I guess he'll be standing by the phone for any last-minute holds. That's right, if none are received, everything will go ahead. The signal will be when I say, "We are now ready to proceed." I will also give a slight nod. I imagine the doctor has advised you on the proper timing and administration of the drug. Yes, sir, he has. Well, unless the doctor has something else? Nothing here. That's it, then. You men probably better get down there. - Yes, sir. - Take a few minutes to set up. Warden: Fine. Oh, one last thing, I imagine the doctor mentioned that your names will be kept confidential. Thank you, sir. The governor will be right in. Don't be nervous, he's a very nice man. Hi, Bill Richards. Good evening Governor, I'm Laura Hyler, I'm sorry to disturb you at dinner. Not at all, Eileen told me you work with Max Adler. Yes, sir. Please sit down, make yourself comfortable. You too, Eileen. I know Max spoke to you yesterday and you turned him down. - May I try? - Of course. Although you know, I told Max my mind was made up. Yes, sir, he told me. This is partly for Ray Graham and partly for me. Governor: I understand. First, Governor, have you considered that Ray Graham has been a model prisoner, no trouble whatsoever? Yes, although on death row the way the men are watched, there aren't many opportunities to do otherwise. But he's been very good, that means if you let him live, he has a chance to redeem himself someday, to help somebody. Or quite possibly to kill someone else. We're not asking you to let him out, we're only asking that you change his sentence to life in prison. Can you guarantee that life imprisonment means unequivocally that he never will get out? I don't think you can guarantee that. Not to my satisfaction. Governor, maybe, maybe not. Anyway, Max and I covered that ground yesterday. All right, I understand, then, I don't want to take my few minutes to debate that with you. I want to go through whatever arguments I can think of. Good, although Max is very skillful. Will you interrupt me as soon as I duplicate Max, or even when you know I'm not getting any-- So that you can move on to the next, of course. Sir, we think it's cruel and unusual punishment. Not according to the Supreme Court. Do you know what they do in actual practice? They strap a man down so he's helpless, straps all across his body and they stick needles in him... I know what they do, whatever they do to Ray Graham is less cruel than what he did to that young boy. I've read the transcripts... Governor, I don't think Ray Graham was cruel. He panicked, he shot somebody while holding up a store. A boy, unarmed, defenseless. Yes, sir, but it wasn't premeditated. There are a thousand people in prison serving shorter sentences of life for just the same thing Ray Graham did. Why execute him? It's like being struck by lightning, it's a lottery, it's not fair. What he did to Kevin Neal wasn't fair. But we're supposed to be fair. We're supposed to be better than Ray Graham. We can't let ourselves sink to doing what the worst of us do or what's it all for? Look at Western Europe, all the civilized countries have stopped capital punishment. You know who does it today? South Africa, Russia, Iran. We are civilized. We act for reasons that I think are civilized. Punishment for crime, retribution... Retribution is a nice word for revenge, I don't think that's very civilized. To make the rest of us safer? Lock him up, throw away the key. That's just as cruel, isn't it? You'd be back in ten years arguing Ray Graham's paid his debt, he's reformed, it's safe to let him out. I wouldn't, you have my word and Max wouldn't either. Well, someone would. Anyway, let me tell you my real reason. I think, I hope that by putting Ray Graham to death someone else gets the message and doesn't do what he did. Governor, you know as well as I do, all the studies about capital punishment being a deterrent are totally inconclusive. There are places where the murder rate went down when capital punishment was abolished. I know, so you can believe in your heart that the death penalty doesn't deter murderers, but I believe in my heart that it does. Sir, it might if murders were planned in advance, but most of them aren't, they happen in a robbery, in an argument. Look, I don't want to argue for everyone else. Ray Graham didn't plan it. He just did it. He didn't think about it, about what would happen if he did or didn't shoot. If he'd get life or death or... But the point is he should have. Maybe if he had thought about it, he wouldn't have gone into that store with a loaded gun, and maybe Ms. Hyler, with all due respect, if there were fewer skillful lawyers like yourself and Max Adler frustrating the will of the people so we could get on with some of these executions, they would be a deterrent. Give them maybe one appeal and that's it. People are afraid, they're scared to death. Sir, you can't rule just by the emotions of the people. You have to lead, not just follow, do what's right not what's popular. There was a time when people wanted slavery too. Right now you have a chance to appeal to the best in us, not the worst. The example that some people would like to see, people say would really be a deterrent, is if we could carry through on all the death sentences and do it now, all hundred and thirty five people on death row all at once, then people would know we were serious, then you'd really have a deterrent that people could believe in. Governor I think that's-- forgive me, I think that's horrible. It would make mass murderers of us all. No, Ms. Hyler, we are not the murderers, they are. There's nothing I can say, is there? Nothing at all. Here's what I think will happen, this one will be on the front page of the paper, and the next one too, and as more and more executions happen, they'll start to put them on page five and then page ten and then page twenty and people will get used to them and they won't have any deterrent value at all. All that'll happen is the gates will be opened, and once that happens, you'll see an innocent person executed, too many blacks and people who can't afford lawyers and society will be in the mass killing business. It's a tragedy. It's so terrible, it's just so terrible. None of us is perfect, Ms. Hyler, we all have to do the best we can as we see it. I'm sorry. I guess I should call Max. Would it be all right if I use the phone? Of course, you'll want privacy. Tell the lady I thanked her for trying. You gonna be there to watch it? Ray, I've fought the death penalty all my life without ever seeing one, and I never will. I don't have the guts for it. Neither do I. You did what you could, and I appreciate it. God bless. I'll pray for you. - I'll be right outside, Ray. - I'll be right here, Padre. How you doing, brother? Chaplain tried to tell me what to expect, but till you get here and see it... Ah place just needs a little paint job and it'll look great. You ought to give the warden an estimate. Maybe I will. That's my room down there. they put me behind this screen because they don't trust you, Vic. They're afraid you might try to slip me something, can't cheat the state. That's where they do it. You doing okay? I got my own room, I got my own shower down the hall, all the soda pop I can drink. The only thing can't do is take long walks alone. Ain't that right, Coombs? That's right. Vic: I guess you got it made. So far so good. - How's Jean and the kids? - Oh, they're good. They all send love. Good, I to them. You talk to Mama? Yeah, poor Mama. It was nice of Carol to come up. She wanted to, Ray. Yeah, so uh, what else is new, Vic? I was just, uh, I was thinking back when we were kids. We used to play ball together at Driscoll Park on Saturdays. You were a good second baseman. I couldn't hit very good. boy we got into some mischief, didn't we? I guess we did. I remember Pop yelling at us. I just wish things could be different, Ray. Gettin' time to wrap it up, Ray. Vic, you're not going to let me die alone are you? I'll be with you. But I don't know how to say this Ray. Just say it. Well afterwards, Mama wants to bury you at home, see, and, uh, these mortuary people, they want almost $600 to drive you back, and, uh, they said it'd be easier if they just cremated you. I don't know, I don't have $600, - but if Mama wants it-- - Oh, yeah, she really wants it. You take care of it, Vic. [ stammers ] I know I haven't been much of a brother, but I always liked you. I'm gonna miss you. - I love you, buddy. - I love you too, Vic. - You take care of yourself. - You too. Vic, tell Mama I love her. If you'd like to come down now, we'll be starting shortly. How do you feel? I'm all right. - Ready? - Yeah. Could you answer a few questions, Mr. Adler? I prefer not to. It's been a long day and I'm pretty tired. Call me at the office first thing in the morning. Just is it possible that this execution may have some deterrent effects? Will I think that executing Ray Graham will stop anybody else from killing? No, I do not. That may be, but it'll make damn good and sure he never has a chance to do it again. I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know that you were here. Mr. Neal is the father of the boy... Yes sir. Yes, I am. I am. I was, and you're representing the man who killed him? I don't know what this gentleman's been telling you, but let me tell you about my son. There's a convenience store not far from where we live. Kevin took a job there to earn money for his car, his dates, whatever kids need money for. He was making $4.25 an hour. He'd been working there about three days, when one night Ray Graham walks in. He wanted the money in the cash register. Kevin never resisted, He gave him everything there was-- $67-- and then, for no reason-- no reason at all-- he shot Kevin. One bullet... right there. And he destroyed my son. See, this was Kevin, he was a beautiful boy, he was bright, he made good grades, he had friends, he had a future, he would have made something of himself. There was never any doubt about that, but he never got to graduate from high school, he never got to do any of the things he dreamed about, he never had an eighteenth birthday... - Dad, its okay... - No, no, no, no. I want these people to know about the Christmases that we'll never be able to share together, about the joy of being a family that was taken away from us. Of never knowing what he could've accomplished or created in his lifetime, of never knowing his children. Mr. Neal, I'm sorry. I really and truly am. What time is it? - 10:40. - Its getting close. How do you feel? Not as afraid as I thought I'd be. Good, when you acknowledge it, you can get a better handle on it. It's just uh, weird, thinking it's all going to end. I mean, tomorrow, you and Coombs are going to be here. I won't. People are going to be laughing and I won't be able to hear them. Sun's going to be shining and I'm not gonna be able to see it. Whole world's just gonna keep on turning whether I'm here or not. It'll be like I wasn't here at all. Same for us all. Not like this. Hell, I'm not even going to see thirty. There is a part of us that goes beyond this life. Maybe. Well, the one good thing about dying young is you don't have to worry about getting old. Padre, can I talk to you private? Listen, I'm, not saying I'm buying any of this, but do you really think there's something to that about life going on after? This is Warden Pratt, have we had any calls? The lines are open? Thank you. Well, we've had no calls from the Governor's office or the Attorney General's. So the execution will proceed. Would you notify Lt. Stanton? I'll do that right now. All right, what's the situation outside? It's under control. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? We'll be starting very shortly. No cameras or electronic recording devices are permitted beyond this point. We also require that all witnesses as well as members of the press be searched, since we don't have the matron, I'll just check your bag, ma'am, okay? I read somewhere once where you see this bright light... and you feel real peaceful. That's when you know you're dead. You think I'll see it, Padre? I hope you do, and I hope you're able to find more peace than you weren't able to find here. Officer Coombs. Yes, sir. They're coming down, Ray. Man can never get himself ready. Well you've done a good job. Words can't mean much now, Ray, but I'm glad we got to know each other better. I appreciate all the time you gave me, Padre. You still got the card the doc gave you? Somebody might as well get something good out of this. Ladies and Gentlemen, we require that all cigarettes be put out and there'd be no smoking inside. Dad, I can't go in there. What's the matter? Why not? I don't want to. A few minutes ago you told the warden... - You do what you want. - Are you mad? I'm afraid it's time, Ray. Bye, Ray. I guess it is. Wait a minute. My legs feel a little weak, like they're too weak to carry me. - No, I can do it. - Okay. - Padre. - We're here, Ray. My shoes, I don't want to die with my shoes on. - That better? - That's Good. That's really good. - Vic. - I'm here. I'm glad you could make it. Vic: Don't I always keep my word? We have had no stay of execution, nor has there been a commutation of sentence. Therefore the sentence ordered by the court will now be carried out. Ray, do you have any last words? Just tell everybody that I don't have any hard feelings towards them and I hope they don't have any towards me. We are now ready to begin. - Don't leave, Vic. - I'm here. It's going to be okay, buddy. It's going to be okay, I'm right here with you. Just try to put me to sleep. Don't fight it, Ray, go easy. - You still there, Vic? - I'm here. Sounds like your voice is coming from far away. I'm right here, buddy. I'm not going anywhere. Don't fight it, Ray. He's dead. [ music playing ]
