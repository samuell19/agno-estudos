Come on! Let's go! I've paid you to lose many times. I want Kobar to win tomorrow, so don't try anything funny. Lose or die! Yes, Sarah? I'm bleeding. The doctor says I need to have surgery to save our baby. Oh, my God. Despite being premature, our baby is strong. He's a champion, like you. Come home, Karisma. Come on! Let's go! Hello, Sarah. You must have a death wish, Karisma. - Bisma! - Yes, Mom! One second! What do you mean, "one second"? Don't put on too much makeup. My makeup won't help, Bisma. Bisma! Excuse me. - Bang Popi, coming through. - Bisma, where are you going? Oh, my God. Bisma! Did you just jump out the window, Bisma? Yes, because we're in a hurry. Let's go. - See you, Uncle Popi. - Bisma. Mom! Oh, my gosh. Mom! Go slowly, Mom. Everything's falling apart back here. What did you say? Forget it. Just keep going. - What? - Keep going. Okay. Keep going. Police. Good morning, ma'am. License and registration, please? License and registration. Don't call me "ma'am," dear respected Mr. Policeman. - Do you know what your mistake is? - I don't. You're driving a scooter while pulling a cart at the same time. That's very dangerous, and absurd. And you in the back. You can't sit facing backwards. You have to face the front or the side. So I have to give you a ticket. Officer, this is my fault. Don't give me a ticket. I made a mistake. Please forgive me. God is all-forgiving, so please forgive me. Ma'am, I'm sorry. This is the law. I have to enforce it. - I'm sorry, officer. Did I scare you? - What do you think? It fell. Can you hold this for me? Put your book away for now. You're the first cop I've encountered who's so selfless. This is the first time. Only you. You're very kind, humble, and handsome. Are you married? I'll take you to your campus first. After that, I'll go to the police station. Why did you have to seduce that cop? Just admit you made a mistake. Bisma, we have to give it a shot. Yes, but they still confiscated the cart. This is all we have left. It's not my fault that cop was gay. - Why are you accusing him like that? - I'm not! How dare you. Why don't you try and seduce him next time? How could you? You want to use your own son as bait? Hurry up. It's my first day. - I can't be late. - Yes, be patient. - I'll be punished. - Yes, Bisma. - Come on, Mom. Hurry up. - I'm already speeding. Our cart was confiscated, the scooter broke down, and now I have to push. - Stop complaining. - Hold this. - How do I bring these home? - Hold this too. Salim. My skateboard. Bye. Take care, dear. - Bisma, be smart. - Please, sir, help her push the scooter. Take care! Yes, please push my scooter. Juniors. Coming late on the first day. I guess you must be ready for your punishment. On my command. Push-up! Sit-up! Do it! Stop. - Where have you been? - The traffic was terrible. Do you know what time it is? The traffic... You're not even officially a student yet and you're already late. - Over there. Hurry! - Hurry. Get in. How dare you? One! Sorry. I didn't mean to. How dare you? I don't even let my boyfriend kiss me. Then I'm luckier than your boyfriend. Thank you, sir. - It wasn't me. It was him. - Bella. - Who's he? - I'm the one who accidentally kissed her. Wait. My name's Bisma. Can we talk about this... - Attar! What do you think you're doing? - What were you doing with this freshman? Why are you upset? You're not even her boyfriend. - I am Bella's boyfriend! - Okay. - Then I apologize. - That's not enough. I apologize to Bella, not to you. Attar! - Finish him, Attar! - Attar, stop! Bella! - Attar, stop! - Get out of my way, Bella. What are you guys doing there? Get over here! We're about to start. - Attar, that's enough. - Yes, sir. We're coming. Hurry! - You wait. - Attar, enough. Stop. Stop? No way. Freshers week just started. - You're dead, Basmi. - Basmi? Attar's right. Because we will destroy him! - Basmi! - Watch out! I'm sorry again. About earlier. Are you sure you still want to sign up for freshers week? Attar's not finished with you. He'll find a way to get you. That's understandable. I would be upset too if another boy kissed you. See you. Give me your signature later. - High five. - No way. - Mo! - Yes. A customer's coming! Help them park. I'm home, Mom. Hey! Bisma! Go. Stop. I'm asking you a question. Is that how you answer me? - Go back. Move forward. - Do it right, Mo. Sir, why don't you order food when you come here? I'm full from watching you make noodles. If you weren't so upset, you'd make great noodles. I'm not upset. But it's different from last time. You were more relaxed. Does it show? I met a girl today. A senior. She's very beautiful. - But? - But she has a boyfriend. And the boyfriend is very arrogant, a bully. Very annoying. - Did you report him to the school? - No. I'm not a snitch. Good. But you have to find a way to make them stop bullying you. What's the girl's name? Bella. As long as Bella has a boyfriend, you have to behave yourself. A champion wins in an honorable way. Yes, sir. Greetings. What are you doing up so late? I'm learning. - Learning what? - Dance. So I can be famous like SM*SH. SM*SH? - Are they martial artists? - No. They dance. They're a boy band. What happened to your mouth? Were you fighting? No, Mom. I fell during freshers week. What's wrong with you? Why do you love to fight? Ever since you were a kid. Can't you find another hobby? You see? That's why I should learn silat. That's impossible! - But it's cool. - No! - It's cool, Mom. - Says who? Says me. Don't be such a smart aleck! You should study. You want to be a thug? Nobody out there wants to be a thug. They want to be entrepreneurs and lawyers. They want to be rich. Nobody wants to be a thug! Life is hard and will only get harder! - So I can learn silat? - No! Then I'll become a boy band member. What are you doing? Naughty. Listen to what he said! Sit down, all of you! That guy, Sar. I look up As I walk So that the tears Won't fall I remember... It's good, right? Do you want some? I'm full. Let me have it. Eat! Yummy. May I have your signature? Thank you. - My turn. - Okay. May I have your signature? May I? Only great freshmen can get my signature. Do you think you're great? - Sure I am. - Where's your proof? I was able to kiss you yesterday. Okay. I guess you don't want my signature. You asked me if I'm great. To me, that was an achievement. Wait for me! - Faster! - I'm so sorry. Your signature is the one that I really want. Okay. One leg up, both arms over your head. Now answer me. Are you great? Since I was a kid, I dreamed of being a great man. To be a strong man who can save a beautiful angel. - Only an angel? - Of course not. I'll save everybody. But I will save the angel first. Hi, Bella. - Why so cold? - You act like a caveman. Give me that. Hurry. I'll give you my signature. Bella's finished with you? Good, because I'm not. You need my signature, right? Stop! I don't need your singing. Just hand me this pen so I can give you my signature. - That's too much. - It's all right. One second, please. You're so mean. Why did you push me? It's nasty in here. - Maybe it's because you're my girlfriend. - But this isn't funny. You're doomed. Good luck finding the pen. Freshers' week isn't the time for bullying. Then don't ignore me. That way, I won't be tempted to harass anyone. Found it! Found it. Found it. Stop. Go away. - Here's your pen. - Don't get too close to me. I have another pen. Thank you very much. Attar! You started it. So don't be such a sore loser. Let's get out of here! Thank you. Thank you. And you're no different. Being a tough man and being a show-off are two different things. So stop looking for trouble. Okay. May I have your signature now? You may. But now, you better go to the locker room and change. Come find me after that. Take a shower. - Where's the locker room? - I don't know! Why are you leaving? Bisma! Don't bully my handsome son, Bisma! Let's put it where everyone can see. Take a free meal, but don't bully my handsome son, Bisma. - Are you Bisma's mother? - That's right. I'm his mom. He came home with bruises yesterday. He said he was beaten up. What are you saying? Look, customers are lining up! - And is he Bisma's father? - Look closely. I'm pretty. Bisma's handsome. There's no way this man is his father. Basmi! So your mother sells noodles? Babe, let's go. Fine. But remember, if you keep ignoring me, I will find a target to bully. - Bisma! - Bisma! Study hard, okay? - My son is very handsome. - Five orders. Deliver them to my house. - Okay. - Don't be too long. - Bisma, don't be like that. - I know you meant well. If you know, then you shouldn't be mad. But that's not how to help. It would be better if you allowed me to learn silat. You don't need to learn silat. Why are you against the idea of me learning silat? Because silat isn't important. Getting bullied and being unable to defend myself, that's useless! - There are other ways to stop that. - Like by giving out free noodles? Bisma, I am your mother and I have the right to protect you. You got that? But that was embarrassing, Mom. They all laughed at me. Apparently, I'm so helpless that my mom has to come and defend me. - Don't push, sir. - I don't push. Don't push, sir. I have a wife. Relax, you're not my type. Here's your money. - It's not enough. - But that's the price we agreed on. I know. But there was a casualty on this ride. - What casualty? - You broke the shock breaker. Thank you, sir! I can buy a new one. - Join us! - Okay! I'm a freshman, I'll join The name's Bisma - Shake it. - Okay! - Pose for me! - Hang on! - Join us! - Okay! Catch it! Okay! Hi. Anything you like here? - Yes. - Which one? You. No. I mean the extracurriculars. Is there something you like? For that, I like this one. Champion three years in a row. - Karate? - Yes, right. What? You don't believe that I can be a champion? Bella, hurry up! Everyone's here. Okay. I've got to go. Bye. - Bella! What's your extracurricular? - It's definitely not karate. - Can I join too? - Sure, if you dare. - Karate? - Yes. Where is it? - Over there, third floor. - Thank you. Okay! Bye! Listen to me carefully. The basis of success is strength. No place for the weak. No mercy! You will do whatever I say. Complaints are not acceptable. Stand up straight! Don't swing. Do you think you're in a boy band? If you quit halfway, you will suffer the consequences. Here it is! Here's your example! We just started and he already stepped back. - I didn't mean to... - What do you mean? - And you talked back? - But it's real. He'll be easy prey. - Where are you going? - You know. - Take out the garbage. - Leave it here. Don't join martial arts. You're fat. Lose weight, get slim, and after that... - I can join karate... - And then you can die. Get out of here. Go to your mom. Attar! My angel. - Pretty, isn't she? - Yes. It's you. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. I came to see my child. Does your child study here too? - A girl or a boy? - A boy. What's his name? You keep asking me questions. Now it's my turn. Is that Bella? Yes. Very beautiful, isn't she? You said you like her. Why are you hiding? You said I have to behave. To me, you're great, Bisma. You're a champion. Everybody else dreams while they're asleep. You dream in broad daylight, with your eyes open. You have a dream, Bisma. So you have to stand tall and be ready. When you see an opportunity, seize it. Why are you scribbling on the glass door? - Why are you scribbling? - No. I was talking to... - To who? - He left. I'd better get going too. Okay, bye. My handsome son. You're such a hard worker. Are you still mad at me? You should stop controlling him. Do you still want to work here or not? I just don't understand. Why don't you let him learn martial arts? It's you who doesn't get it. To me, a great man is one who can provide for his wife and children. If you know martial arts but can't provide for your family and make them happy, then what's the point? How do you know we won't be happy if I know martial arts? I'm older than you. It's all right, Mo. Mom, I'm going. - Where are you going? - We have an orientation on campus. Don't stay out too late. I won't. I'll be back in the morning. Got it, Mom. - Bye. - Bye. - Mom. - What? Who will stay with you, then? - I don't know. - What about me? Okay. I can use you to block the door. Aren't I too big to block the door? Bella! Wrong girl. I'm sorry. Where is she? - Bisma. - What? This is a party. Why aren't you dancing? I am dancing. What kind of dance is that? Come on. Come with me. - Where are we going? - Just follow me. - The party's over there. Why are we here? - We have a party here too, Basmi. - What party? - This is the party. What's going on in here? You don't think we know who ruined our pictures earlier? Okay. I admit it. But I did a good job, didn't I? Yeah, pretty good. - Now it's my turn to draw. - Wait. - We can talk about it. - Shut up. Wait. Take this. Draw on his face, Attar. Hey! Don't move! - Don't fight! - Make it good. We'll grade it. Scribble all over his face. Now write his name. Stop moving! Don't struggle. Now you know you shouldn't playing games with us. Don't move! Now you look cool. Thank you. Now we're even. Every artist signs his work. In this case, a signature with my foot. Now we're even! What's the matter? You don't like it? I think Basmi is upset. This tough guy is mad. Why aren't you laughing? - You were laughing earlier. - You're a tough guy? Come on, smile. So you're a tough guy? You're a tough guy? Come on then. Fight me if you're a champion. This is what you call a champion? He's crying. A tough guy is a man who can provide for his family and make them happy. Now, that's a real champion! But what can you do if I attack your family? He said he's a champion. A tough guy. Bella, come and dance. - Yeah. You're always busy. - Looking for Attar? No way! But isn't he your boyfriend? Don't tell me you like that Basmi instead. - His name is Bisma! - His name is Bisma. Get out! We need to use these toilets. Hurry! What is he doing here? Why is it locked? Is someone in here? Hurry up! Get out. - Hurry up! - Can I get the stuff? - Is someone in here? - Get out. - Don't. - Why? - I'm scared. - You're scared of kissing? - Take this. - What is it? Just trust me. I bet the boss is now... - I need to use the bathroom. - No, you can't. You'll feel ten feet tall. Tall? I want to be tall. They keep calling me short at home. Bastard! Who dares to mess with me? Basmi just ran out of the bathroom. Get him, idiot! Hey! Did you see Basmi? Bisma! Bisma. Are you all right? Basmi! Bella, Attar is not a good guy. - That's what you want? - Let's go! - Egi, stop! - Let go, Bella! Take him! - Attar! - Bella. - Bisma! - Bella! Listen to me. - What do you think you're doing? - Bella! Stay out of this. - You're a fool, Basmi! - You're the foolish one. You think you can do whatever you want? - Dealing drugs on campus? - Shut your mouth! Soon, Bella will... Listen to me. The only way you're leaving is on your hands and knees. Kneel down and beg for my mercy. What if I just buy you some noodles? I told you, crawl! Kneel down! Maybe they do everything you tell them to. But me? Never. Just give in! Or else I'll kill you, and people will know you're just a worthless scumbag! Poor Bella. She doesn't know that you're nothing but a wimp. - Let your fingers go! Let go! - No! - Give in. Kneel down before me! - I will never kneel down before you. - Kneel down, I said! - Attar, that's enough. Kneel down before me. Release your hands or I'll cut them off! Never. Bisma. You deserve to die. Enough, Attar. Yeah. You could kill him. Bisma. Get up. Why should I stop? Nobody's watching. Are you serious? Yes. Get up. Come back. Now you die. Run. Get out of here. Come on, let's go! Bisma! Now sound asleep Until morning light Bisma. Get some sleep. Bisma. Bisma is "siluman." "Siuman." He's not a ghost. Sorry, I was too excited. Mom. Why am I here? According to that girl, you were found unconscious. Bisma, who did this to my son? Did your friends do that? Kids nowadays are insane. Their fights are brutal. They don't act like college students. Who did this? Tell me. I'll boil them alive and make meatballs out of them. - Silly. - Do you want something, Bisma? - Nothing. - Want to be introduced to the nurses? The nurses. Watch your mouth. - Are you friend of Bisma? - Yes. I'm a senior. A senior? You're great, Bisma. Maybe he has an Oedipus complex. He likes older woman. I'm his brother. Why am I here? Last night, I saw Attar chasing you. I looked for you and I saw Attar leaving the alley where I found you. - If I found you sooner... - You found me, that's all that matters. It shows that you care about me. Thank you for helping Bisma. You're so beautiful. Thank God you were there. Are you Bisma's girlfriend? - What's wrong, Bisma? - What are you saying? We're not in a relationship yet. So you're not in a relationship. It doesn't mean there's nothing there. It's just not happening yet. When you two are in a relationship, let me know, okay? I'm... Attar's girlfriend. The guy who did this to Bisma. The police came to my house. - The police? - Yes. It must be Bella. The police said she saw us beating Basmi up. Why don't you just dump that girl? But she hasn't put out yet, you idiot. You're an idiot if you got beat by a girl. Do you think you're still qualified to be in this organization? - But something is weird here. - Maybe you're weird. You lost to a little kid. - But he suddenly became strong. - No such thing as "suddenly." It's either he's great or you're just a fool. Find out how he managed to beat you up like this. Leave the police to me. Bisma, you're still sick. Go back upstairs. Now. I'm tired of being stuck in my bedroom. I'm all well now. Stop it. You're silly. - Mo, tell him to go back to sleep. - But I just woke up... The dough stays like this. - How many eggs did you use? - Three. If you use three eggs, twist the dough like this. You're just a big guy. It still hurts, doesn't it? Does it still hurt? Just say it. No, Mom. You know you have a great son. Here, I'll show you. If you're that great, show me. Mo, watch this. You're here? - Bisma, that was cool! - I know it's cool. What do you mean, it's cool? - But... It hurts, Mom. My feet! - Right. Bisma! Come here. - What now? - It hurts. No, I lied. - Now it really hurts. - Naughty boy. The noodles. - Bel. - No, Attar. You can't just do whatever you want. - Of course I can. Why not? - But not with me. Maybe you should find someone else that you can bully. - Bella, where are you going? - Sorry, I've got to go. Bella. Wait for me. Bel, wait! Bel, you better watch what you're saying. That's why I told you, we're finished. And my answer hasn't changed. We're finished when I say we're finished. You don't get it. The foundation of a relationship. And it's all because of Basmi, is that it? Don't you dare mess with me. Even your report to the police doesn't affect me. And if you dare leave me, that Basmi boy will face the consequences. You just don't know who I am. You're the guy who left Bisma dying in that alley. And I don't like wimps like you. - Who said that? - A cat. Show yourself! If you want to be a thug, do it outside, not in here. This is a library. They say when two restless people sit back-to-back under this palm tree... - Are you restless? - Yes. I need love and affection. - Not funny. - I'll repeat it. They say when two restless people sit back-to-back under this palm tree, they fall in love with each other in eight seconds. - That's ridiculous. - It's true. You can try it if you don't believe me. Are you scared? Why should I be? That's right. Don't be scared to let go of the wrong person to get the better one. Now, close your eyes and imagine the person that you long for the most. Now, we count. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. What do you think? The eight-second theory, is it true? I don't know. Why don't you find out? I think it's wrong. Because I fell for you in less than eight seconds. Yes, I like you. I can't tap you? This one? What a really big house. Okay. Get off now. Be careful. One second, please. Pass me the helmet. - Is this really your house? - It's my parents' house. Come on. I would love to, but in the old romance movies, there's usually a ferocious dog. - That's my dad. - Your dad. - Him again. - The ferocious dog is home. Dad. - Dad, this is Bisma, my college friend. - Hello, I'm Bisma. I like a young man with a strong grip. Thank you, sir. - That's an antique scooter you have. - It's my mom's. Only I use it. - Your mom? - Of course. It can't be Bella's mom. I'm sorry. Bella, invite him in. You can talk inside. Thank you, sir, but I have to get going. I have to watch my mom's noodle stall. - Really? - Her noodles are really good. I'd like to try them sometime. Give my regards to your mom. - Okay, sir. I'll tell her. Bye, Bella. - Drive safe, Bisma. Bisma, what's wrong with your scooter? Did it break down? - No. It's fine. - But I don't hear any sound. I'm using stealth mode. See? It's working. Bye. This friend of yours... - What about him, Dad? - He's unique. See? It's working. Bye. - Hello. - Bisma, is your scooter okay? It's okay. I'm pushing it right now. You see? Quit being so formal. Is it okay to use the casual tense with seniors? Of course it's okay. You had the guts to take a senior home. Shall we be even more familiar? Don't push your luck, or it'll be "sir" and "ma'am" instead. All right, I won't push my luck. I can wait. You want me to accompany you on your way home? No. I don't want you to get varicose veins. A pretty girl shouldn't have varicose veins. Not accompany you pushing the scooter, but staying on the phone. Yes, of course. Bisma? Amazing, Basmi. You're still upright. What power did you use when you defeated me? Answer me! Answer me. The power that you used to defeat me last time, use it. Was it black magic? Turns out that you're nothing compared to me. Listen. You won't be able to knock me out this time. Bisma! Bisma. Wake up! Bisma! Bisma, wake up. Come on, Bisma. Help me. Hold on tight to my shirt. Bisma! - Did you see my son, sir? - No. Bisma, where are you? Mom. Mom. Mo. Mo. Mo. Mo! - Are you okay? - Did you ask if I'm okay? If you want to scare me, do it properly. Why are you eating alone in the middle of the night? It's all your fault. These were originally for the customers. They couldn't eat them because your mom saw you get home badly injured. - Is she mad? - Not mad, she's... What would you call it? She was sad, panicked. And Bella came here, telling us that you and your scooter got hit. Your mom was so worried that she closed the shop right away. She apologized to all the customers. Your mom loves you, Bisma. And I love my mom too, Mo. That's why I want to be a great man, so I can protect her. But life has never been in my favor. None of my dreams ever come true. I'm tired, Mo. What's the point of living if I keep losing? I'm also tired, talking to you like this. You're upstairs and I'm here. It's like sitting in the first row at the movies. I have to lift my head. It's going to rain. Get down here and help me move this inside. It's going to rain. Come on, get down. Help me. Yes, one second. It hurts. - Mom? - Bisma, are you okay? Come, we'll go together. BUS STOP MODERN MARKET I'm forced to do this. This is colonialism. I'm like an Egyptian slave. Over here, Mo. What if I catch a cold? It would take three years for me to recover. That's a long time. - You talk too much, Mo. - Stop. - Thanks, Mo. - I'm soaking wet. Getting caught in the rain. It's wet. Mom, if you want to make noodles, we can do it at home, not here. Just you wait. Be patient. Somebody will come soon. You see? The rain adds to the romantic atmosphere. - Why does she keep smiling? - Maybe she's stressed out. - Sir, would you like some noodles? - Yes. One please. - One? - Yes. - Me too. - One order of noodles? Yes. - This is it. Get the plates. - Get the bowls, Mo. Here you go, ma'am. What would you like to drink? - Mom, three orders of noodles. - Okay, one minute. Bisma, never give up. There is a way to everything... if you believe and you're willing to work for it. Yes, Mom. Now, give these noodles to that man. - Go on. - Thanks, Mom. - One order. - Okay. - Make it two. - Okay. Separated. With chili. Thank you. - Get me some bowls, Mo. - Okay. - Who is he? - His name is Bisma. A freshman on our campus. - And his father? - I don't think he still has a father. And his mom sells noodles. Nothing special about him. It's you who is unremarkable, because you lost to him. Or maybe you're just a spoiled boy who craves your parents' attention. But... what Attar said is true. It's not his fault. It's not our fault. You can see from the video... Kobar! Are you trying to kill me? Let me know before you kick someone. You scared me half to death. Are you so worthless that sissy boy had to defend you? There's no place for the weak in this organization. We show no mercy! You bring that boy here. Yes, boss. - Are you sure, Kobar? - Positive. That's the move that injured me 20 years ago. - She's so different. - Her skin is so pale. - Let's go eat. I'm starving. - Okay, but it's your treat. No point, then. - Bel, let's eat. - Monica will treat us. That doesn't happen every day. What is she looking at? Can I have some of your balloons? They're not for sale. These are only for Bella. I want your balloons. Why do they want these balloons? They're not for sale. They're for Bella alone. What a strong wind. - Bisma. - Yes? - I want to thank you. - For what? You helped me. - But it's you who helped me. - Bisma... What's wrong with Bella? My mom scolded me when I got home after Friendship Night for being high. But they said you helped me. You even fought with Attar. You were even wounded. - And now you bring me these balloons. - They're not for you. If they're not for me, then for who? - For... - I'm sure they're for me. - They're for... - Of course they're for you, Lisa. - See? - But I'll take Bisma, okay? Let's go. Bye. Have fun playing with the balloons. Why are you taking him? Those balloons were actually for you. Looks like Lisa needs them more than I do. Besides, you were so sure it was me. Because you're the only one on this campus who's nice to me. I don't think so. - And you just got yourself new fans. - Who? Talking about me? Are you making a habit out of showing up unannounced? Because I'm your fan now. What do you want now, Attar? Relax. I'm here to apologize for the misunderstanding last time. - Misunderstanding? - I'm a man. I lost control. - It's because you take drugs. - You're right. I promise I'll quit if you give me a chance. - A chance? What about giving out drugs? - Those kids asked for it. We were just handing them out. - We're not dealers. - No more. Not anymore. I swear. As a token of apology, I'd like to invite you to practice with us. - What for? You're still not satisfied? - No. Now we're friends, man. Right? - Come on, Bis. Let's practice together. - You can use me as a punching bag. After evening prayer, I'll be waiting. - Don't go. - I'll be waiting. Make sure you come. - Don't forget, Basmi. - It's Bisma. Bisma, are you serious? I study here because I want to learn martial arts. You still insist that you don't know silat? I don't know silat. - Another martial art? - Nothing. If I did, my hand wouldn't be so badly injured. Do you really think the people who did that to you can change? That they could easily apologize and chalk it up to a misunderstanding? - I hope Attar really wants to change. - But he can't change that fast. It's a process. It takes time for people to change. Or maybe you have another motive? - You want revenge. - Why are you attacking me now? Because you're not who I thought you were. What do you mean? Have you been honest with me? Am I not honest enough for you? You know I'm the son of a noodle merchant. You know Mom, you know Mo. You even know that I like you. - Whatever. - Bella. Hi, sweetie. I have good news for you. The court finally approved our divorce. Can you imagine? I've been waiting four years to confirm my status. And now, I'm all free. The choice is yours, whether you want to live with your dad or me. And now, I'm in Switzerland. I really need time. - Sir. - What? Someone's looking for you. I thought you said we were finished. - I didn't come here to talk about us. - About what, then? I want you to put this to an end. Your problem with Bisma has gone too far. Attar, you have so many things that other people don't. And you have so many opportunities. You came here to insult me! What's so great about Bisma? Get a hold of yourself. This isn't you. This is me. This is the guy that you dumped! Fine. If you can't talk nicely, I better go home. You listen to me. We're finished when I say we are! You dumped me! You insulted me! And now, you came here for Basmi. Mo, where is Bisma? Why isn't he home yet? - I bet he's with Bella. Call him. - I did. He didn't answer. Then he's with Bella for sure. If I were with Bella, I wouldn't answer my phone, either. What do you mean by that? - I don't understand. - Quality time with Bella, heart to heart. - Watch what you say. - I'm sorry. My son isn't home at this hour. I have a bad feeling. Do you know where he is? You don't know, do you? Stop joking. I'll go find my son, then. Where are you going? Open the shop first. - Let it stay closed. - What will I eat then? Whatever you like! Why are we here? What is this place? - Let's go in. - We can't practice here, can we? - Somebody wants to meet you. - Who? You'll see. Hold on. Just relax. - What is this place? - Attar. I'd like to introduce you to someone. Kobar. - Are you Bisma? - Yes. Are you related to a man named Karisma? I don't know anyone named Karisma. Let's get to the point. How do you know that move? No way. That's not me! If that's not you, then who is he? A ghost? Don't tell me you lost to this kid. You still insist you don't know silat? Okay. Maybe this'll make you stop pretending. Bella! Bisma! Bella! This is your last chance to prove to me that you deserve to be in this organization. Make him understand that there's no use fighting. I'll let her go if you prove to me you're Karisma's son... Bella has nothing to do with this. Let her go! I'll be waiting in the place we fought last time. I don't know what you're talking about! Who is Karisma? I don't know him! So stubborn. You still don't get it? Without Bella, you'd be dead already. - Bella! - Bisma! You've humiliated me. Now you have to pay! Now tell me, who are you? Get your hands off my son! Tell me the truth! Daddy. - Daddy. - Bisma. Bisma, you're such a big boy now. How are you? Come in and stop by for a minute. Maybe Bisma misses his father. I'm the one who misses him. Bye, Bisma. Mom! Mom. "Karisma." Where have you been? I've been looking for you. Who is this man? Is he my dad? Mom, is it true that Dad's name is Karisma? Answer me, Mom. Mom. Why didn't you tell me? Dad comes here all the time. - Where? - To our shop, Mom. Dad's always there with me when I'm making noodles. - Stop this nonsense. - What nonsense? Everything you say is nonsense! Dad was with you, talked to you. Unexplainable things have happened to me lately. I survived Attar's attack twice because I know martial arts. Impossible! I know it's impossible because I've never learned silat. But that's a fact, and everything is related to Dad. Your dad has gone! He's left us forever! - No, I really saw him! - Bisma! - You're wrong, Mom! - Your dad was murdered! Is that what you want to hear? You want me to tell you how great your dad was, defending our country? How he represented his country and it's gone unrecognized? You know where he ended up? He ended up working as security at a night club. Sometimes, he was forced to take part in high-stakes fights. He was forced to lose the fight so he could bring home some money. Now you know the reason why I never let you learn silat. Should I have to go through it a second time? To hear my husband was killed in the street like trash... Will I hear the same news when you die the way that he did? Now you answer my question! I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry. - But I really saw Dad... - Bisma! Did you really see him? Do you remember our old house, when you were little? You used to play at the silat academy because it wasn't far from our house. That's where they keep your dad's trophies. Daddy. Bisma! But it's a place for people who are already dead! Bisma! Sir, help me. - I got caught in the rain. - It's late. The academy is closed. Please let me come in, just for a minute. Perhaps you remember me? I'm Bisma. Bisma? - Bisma! Come in. - Thank you. You used to play here when you were little. Your mom had to come to get you. But you shouldn't come late at night like this. Especially when it's raining. I'm sorry. I just miss my dad. All right. But not too long, okay? Dad, it's Bisma. Why didn't you tell me it was you who came to see me? Are you upset that I never come here anymore? I'm here now, Dad. Dad, where are you? Dad, I miss you. I want to see you. I miss you! Daddy! Dad! Dad. - Dad. - Wait! - Does it hurt? - Of course it hurts, Dad. I can call you "Dad," right? Of course you can. I miss you calling me Dad. It's so lonely without you. Nobody can see me, nobody can hear me. Nobody can talk to me. Only you. Why, Dad? Maybe because you're my son. For me, happiness is being able to be with you and your mom. To be able to look after you. And to be able to calm Sarah down when she panics. But I don't know how long I can stay like this. I always pray... to have the time to say goodbye to you. To make sure that you're going to be all right. Dad. Bisma. Bisma. - Mom. - Bisma. Do you believe me now that your father is dead? Yes, Mom. But he never left us. - Bisma... - Mom. Tell me what it'll take to make you believe me. No, Mom. Wait. Tell her to ask something only I know the answer to. Ask me something that only Dad knows the answer to. How long do you want to torture me? How long? - Until you give Dad a chance. - A chance for what? A chance for him to say something to you. Dad is still around, maybe because he hasn't gotten a chance to say goodbye to you. All right. Ask your father. You ask him. Why didn't he honor my request? Why didn't he honor my request when I gave birth to you? Because you said Bisma was just like me. Because Bisma is a champion. Because you said I'm just like Dad. I'm a champion. I didn't want him to have a father who got paid to lose. Bisma's father is not a coward! Dad didn't want to be a coward father, getting paid to lose. For you... I had to be a champion that night. That night Dad became a champion, Mom! But I lost you, Karisma! I lost you, Karisma. If you can hear what I'm saying now, you answer me, Karisma. Why weren't you there for me? Why? I came to you, Sarah. I'm always there in your dreams. Mom... Dad is always there. He comes to your dreams. Every night, when you laid me down to sleep... when you were alone and confused, feeling lost... Dad was there with you all the time. Bisma. That's right, Bisma. Your dad is always there. He's always there in my dreams. Forgive me, Sarah. Is Bella here, Dad? Yes, Bisma. This is where I fought with Kobar. One more time, Bisma. Kobar! - He's alone. - Great. He'll die just like his father. - Bisma! - I guess you mean a lot to him. Alone or with my father, I'll do what you want this time. What I want? You wanted revenge, right? This is your moment. Let her go. We'll fight like men. I see you're brave. But you have to prove to me first that you're good enough to fight me. - Bisma! - Bella! Mom. What took you so long? Cell phone! Bella! Bisma! Pardon me, officer, but please hurry up. Don't take as long as you do in the movies where the police arrive after everybody else has left. Okay, officer? Hurry up. - Yes, hurry. - What are you doing? I'm talking here. Okay, officer. Thank you. - Here. Done. - Okay. Let's go home now. We can't do that. I can't go home before I know Bisma and Karisma are safe. We're family. We're one. We can't leave our family behind. Get in! Shut up. Don't struggle. This is your fault. Why should you hang out with Karisma's son? Now you have to face the consequences. Kobar won't let you go. We're not afraid! Get them! - Bella! - Where's Bisma? Let's go and look for him. Just sit down. Take a deep breath. Go home, wash your feet and reflect. Watch your cholesterol levels. You're obese. Sit down. So it's true. You are Karisma's son. Unfortunately, you'll be his last descendant. You're going to experience the same suffering that Karisma caused me. How dare you defeat me? Now you'll have to pay with your eye. Tonight, you'll pay for my eye with your life. You leave me with no choice. Dad. I guess Karisma's greatest move in martial arts died with him. Dad! Bisma. Our time together has come to an end. Dad. Now you're the man of the house. No, Dad. Remember, Bisma. You're a champion. No! Dad! Bisma! Mom, it's Dad! Dad! It's pointless to call for him. Karisma is dead. Karisma! Tonight, I will send your wife and your son to hell. Bisma! Bisma! Your father never left us. Your father will always be with us! I know. Every time I look at you, I see your father. Bisma! Find him, Bisma! Find your father within you! Come on, Bisma! Karisma? No way. Mo... Bisma. Bisma, now that you know how to fight, you have to maintain it. - Use it wisely. - Yes, Mom. So I can learn silat now? Why are you doing this to me? This friend of yours... You said you want to be a great man. Isn't he unique? He's a champion. - Or should I join a boy band? - No, Bisma. Why a boy band? Bisma! I think it's time to give you a smack again! A male champion. I forgot what's next. You're the... Now you're the man of the house. I told you... Don't come in too quickly! Hey!
