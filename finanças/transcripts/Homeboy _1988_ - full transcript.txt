Kind of smells from all that rain. You look like a cowboy. You a cowboy? I like cowboys. - Stop! Stop! Get out of here. Give me a minute. You got nothing here. - Can I borrow your compact, please? - How do you organize your money? I don't understand this. Supposed to put 20s first, then you got the 10s, then you put the fives. Where the fuck you been? - His bus was late. - You're another beauty here. Here. - Thanks. - 25 years of picking you bums up. You're all the same. Go to the bus stop to pick 'em up. He's in a gin mill getting drunk. - Listen to me, I get annoyed. Don't bring up damn jokes about cholesterol. I am telling you, I viewing this man. He's two days late. - Relax. You worry so much. Give me a kiss. Don't worry. - Get away from me. Wesley. - It's time. Oh, there he is. Wesley Presley. Women, come and get me. Oh, so pretty.

Come on and get your fighter. Can't you control him? Come on, save it for the fight. Okay, let's get some instructions. Let's go. Hey, Johnny? Come on, Lou. Let's get your guy out here. Hey, does he want to fight tonight? - Yeah, I got him. John, come on. Come on, John. Please? Come on, let's go. - Let's go. - Get out here. - Remember what I told you guys in the dressing room, okay? I want a good clean fight. Let's touch gloves. Let's get with it, John, with the program. Touch gloves. There you go. You got your hands full tonight. - Tell me about it. - Okay, break. Break! I told you guys to break. Come on. Let's get out of that. Look here. When I tell you to break, Roscoe, I want you to break clean. You understand? What are you doing? - Fuck you! - Hey! Next time you do that, this fight's over. You understand? This fight's over. I'm not telling you no more. Now settle down. Come on over here. - Moe. What's the guy's name? - Johnny Walker. - Johnny Walker? That's a great name. Hey, John! Come on, John! Move, move! That's right, John. - Sit down. Sit down. - Sit down, Wesley. Sit down. - Boom, boom! Bang-bang! Ow! - Yo, sit down. Sit down, asshole. - What's the matter? - Break it. Break it. When I tell you to break, I want you to break. - Will you sit down? The fight is the ring, man. Sit down. - Break clean. Break clean. - You say something? - Hold it. Hold it here. Let his head out. Let me look at that cut. That's okay.

Get back to your corner, Roscoe. - Come on. Let's work. Let's go. - Roscoe, you got it. - Okay, Johnny, this is the last time I'm gonna warn ya. Any more crap out of you, and you ain't getting paid. And that goes for you too, Lou. - He's just going through the motions. Just go out there and do the basic simple fundamentals, and it'll be very simple. - All right, spit it out. Go ahead. - Keep your footing, and keep that jab going, 'cause then you'll be fine. All right, go get him. - Stay away from his right hand. You'll open that son of a bitch right up. Come on. - This time, Roscoe. Let's go. Finish him up. - Whoo-ee! Yeah, hey! - One, two. It's all over. - How old are you, Walker? 100 years old? You're all through. You're over the hill, buddy. You're an old man. You're an old-timer. Forget it. You bum. You're terrible. You're nothing. You're old, Johnny Walker. Too old, buddy. You're an old man. You're an old-timer. Forget it. You're terrible. You're nothing. Forget it. Come on, Walker. - Can you watch where you're going? What are you looking at? - Hey, man. You got my money? - I got your money. There's your money. Jesus. - Lou. Congratulations. Boom, boom. You got a guy here, I'll tell ya. I love the way you fight, John. I never saw anybody fight like that. Am I right? Huh? Call ahead. Get the table. I'm Wesley Pendergrass. I like you. You get dressed, okay? I'll take you for something to eat. Keep it. I got to tell you something upfront. I know a lot of people. I know everybody in this fucking town. Nothing goes down I don't find about it. That's important, keep informed. I got this gig. I do it on the side. Moe owns a couple of strip joints. I go in. I bullshit a little. I do an act onstage. It sucks, but it's better than working. And it keeps my PO off my ass. I can sing a little, I'm a pretty good dancer, and I have fun fucking up the songs. - Hey, Wesley! - Huh? - Hello! Who's this guy? - I'm gonna kill you! - Why? - You fucking punk! Where you been? - What are you talking about, man? Take it easy. - You winding me up? - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't fuck with me, man. - You're gonna pull a knife on me? You are gonna pull a knife on me? - I ain't no punk! - Well, what are you gonna do with that, huh? - I don't know. Oh! - Stay off my nose. What's the matter with you? - Will you move your fucking car? - Hey, you got a problem? Hey, shut up! Where's my money? Give me my fucking money! - Hey, man! - Right now! - I got it right here. Take it easy. - Give it to me. Come on, come on! - Take it easy. Here. Man, what do you got to always hit me for, Wesley? - Where you been? Hey, how you doing? - What are you kicking the shit out of him for? You want to kick the shit out of him, you do it somewhere where you don't hold up traffic. - Hey, man, nobody's going to kick the shit out of me. - Hey, scrote, move that hunk of shit over to the curb and shut up. - Scrote? - Shut up. Wesley, I heard you pulled a nickel. How come you're back on the bricks so soon? - Scrote? What is that, French? - Ray, I ain't gonna tell you again. Move it on. - Stupid. - Get out of the street. Let's go. - He with you? - Yeah. - I'm not gonna tell you again. Get out of the street. - Hey, man. Don't punch me with that stick. - It's okay. I'll handle it. Looks like somebody kicked the shit out of you. - Johnny's a fighter, lieutenant. He fought tonight. Knocked out some spear-chucker at the arena. - Stay out of trouble, boys. - Come on. This is it. The place. My place. Come on. You know, don't worry about that guy, Grazziano. Known him for 15 years. He's crazy. He hates me. He hates the fact that people like me. You know what I mean? He hates it, and he hates the fact that people like you. He's like a bitter person. I hate that. Hey, Moe, how you doing? - Good. - John, come on. See, he's like a sick person. - Anyway, this is it. I share this with some girls. Give me your bag. Here, just put it down. Make yourself, no, watch. Watch the show. - Hey, that cop, man, he's like a fucking nightmare. - Exactly. We got to be cool. It's hot out there, man. Some jerk-off iced someone doing a job the other night. I mean I mind my own fucking business. I ain't going to jail for no murder. Huh? Come on, come on. Give me the tap shoes. - What, these things? - Yes. Where's the tie? - I don't know. You have three of 'em. - You know something, what are you, high? Huh? - Hey. - Fuck. She moves everything. What the fuck am I supposed to do here? These people. - Thank you very much, ladies and germs. I just flew in from the coast. My arms are exhausted. This is my band, otherwise known as Bernie Beamer and the Busted Hymens. There you are. All right, let's do "Fine and Dandy". Take it away. - Hey, watch it, pal. - Ah! - Hey, look. Little horses. - Come on, let's go. - Hey, we're closed. You have to come back tomorrow. - Oh, hey. Hey, we want to ride. - That's too bad. I said we're closed. - Oh, come on. Please? - Hey. - Whoa! - I said we're closed. - Bitch. - The lady says she's closed, boys. - We were just having some fun. - Where'd you come from? - Nowhere. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Hey. How about a cup of coffee? - I said we're closed. - Okeydoke. - That's it. That's it. Drop it. That's it. - Yo, my man. - Yo. - I forgot what color I am. - You forgot what color you are? - What color am I? - You're black. I'm red. You got to be black. - Are you sure? - I'm not the one who's confused. I know my color. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Hey, Johnny boy. Where you been lately? - Yo, man, I've been around. - How you feeling? - I feel like working out. - The locker room's down on the left. - Hey man, that's what I need. A white fighter. Make a lot of money with a white fighter. Get rich. Just can't make no money with a black fighter. Jesus. What color did you say I was? - Black. - Left hand. Left hand. Don't wait. - Look sharp. - How you doing? - All right, good to see you, Moe. - How's my boy doing? - He's doing great. He's working like... undefeated, huh? 15 and 0. 11 knockouts. I'm moving him up, but we can't get him any decent work. - This is the fighter I was talking about. Eh. We'll want to see him move around a bit. - Can he go a couple of more rounds? Hey, Lou? Can your guy give Cotton a couple of rounds, huh? Lou! - You up to it? - I'll give him some work. - Just look at him. Look at this guy. Look at this guy's arms. - He don't want to cover up? He don't want to cover up? - This kid Cotton can really hit. - What is this shit? Look at this. - Doesn't your guy know what the bell means, huh? - Don't he know to protect himself at all times? - Ah, this is work, huh? We ain't getting paid for this. - Hey, asshole! You don't pull that kind of shit on my fighter. You pull that kind of shit, you go back to where you came from. You understand? Hey! Get out of here! - Hey, fat man, nobody tells me where to go back to. - Get out of here. Fuck you! Fuck you, Walker! - Get out of here! - Hey, where'd you come from? - Over there. - Thanks for the other night. - Mind a soda? - We're even. - Hey, is all this yours? - Yeah. My grandfather left it to me. Business is kind of bad. Carousel doesn't work. Ponies get sick. I get by. - Looks old. - Everything gets old. I guess I never thought of doing anything else. He never minded, though. We came here every day. Even when I was real small, he used to let me wear his coin changer. I'd be giving people the wrong change, and he'd tell me how many times to press the button to give the right change. - Hmm. Whoo. - Sometimes, you know, if people didn't have enough money, he'd just let them ride for free. He just loved to see all the kids laughing and having a good time on the horses. At night he'd be so tired. And then it'd be my turn. Couldn't wait for it to be my turn. I remember one night he was standing there in the rain, watching me go round and round. You're not talking too much. Is something wrong? - No. - You're very quiet. - Break, break, break, break, break! - Come on. Give him a light drip. - Bullshit. - Boo! - Ladies and gentlemen, we have a decision. Judge tally line scores of 77 to 76, Franzetti. Judge Felix, challenger has it 77 to 75, Walker. And judge Lewis scores it 76 to 76. This bout is a draw. - Fight's over, fight's over. Come on. Come on, fight's over. - Come on. Come on, guy. - Don't matter. I won. - You won. It was a hometown decision. A hometown thing. Got to put him away. You didn't put him away because you ran out of gas. - Hey, man, I won. - What do you have to drink for? You're killing yourself. - Hey, Lou, shut the fuck up, man. - Okay. Don't get mad, huh? Don't get mad. You won. But if you were in better shape, you would have knocked that piece of shit right out. - Hey, Lou, stop the goddamn car, man. - We're in the middle of the bridge. - Stop the goddamn car! - Okay, where you going, fucker? Where the fuck are you going? Get back here! Hey, Johnny, get back in the car. Come on. - Jesus fucking Christ, man. Get the fuck out of here! - Jimmy you know that macho is must too fast for that tomato. - Ah, your runner, he couldn't take a punch. - Couldn't punch, couldn't hit him. - Wipe that ketchup off your face. I'll be right back. - Bullshit. That's all it is. A bunch of-- - Jimmy. How come I always see you together? What's the matter with you guys? I'm starting to get suspicious of this relationship. - Yeah, uh-huh. You're suspicious of it? Wesley, you don't know shit from shinola. - Don't you worry. What he's going to do, bling-bang. You know how he is. Believe me. Take my word for it. You know where your money goes. - Would Dr. Marshall please pick up the courtesy phone at reception? - Hey. - What's up? - So I'm down at the hotel. There's a fucking convention going on here. The place is crawling with doctors. You should check it out. Listen, I got to be careful, huh? - Then be careful. - That was a dynamite man, no doubt about it. - Housekeeping. Hello? Shit! - Oh! I'm hot and I want to take a bath. - No, no, no. I want you right now. - Oh, please. Let me take a bath. - No, no. Oh, baby, no! - Oh, please, let me take a bath. - No, no. I want you just the way you are, baby. - Come on. Oh! Oh, you're so sexy. Oh, oh. Oh! - Oh, baby, I just want to give it all to you. - Oh, I want to take it all. - Hello, John. Would you like an apple? It's McIntosh. I prefer Granny Smiths myself, but they didn't have any. - Hey, what's a Granny Smiths? - That's a green apple, John. - Oh, give me that beaver, baby. Oh, winky dinky, baby. Yeah, winky's my favorite baby. - More, more, more. - Oh, yeah! You like that? Yeah? - Oh, I like that. - Like that? That's called the turtle, baby. Yeah. - Oh, god. Stick it. - Where's your partner? - Wesley? Hey, I don't know. - Hot throbbing cock! - Yeah! - Oh! - Yeah, I will! - Oh! No! - Oh, bunny! Oh! - Hi. - Oh, sorry. I'm fixing the bed. - It's okay. I just want to take a nap. Here. That's for you. - Thank you. - I got to run, John. Hey, John. Got to know your apples, John. - Did he ask you anything about me? - He said something about apples. - What do you mean? Apples? - Man, I don't know. - Guy gives me the creeps. You know, I know that he knew I was in there. I mean, a prick. You know, he's got a hard-on for me. He wants his pound of flesh. What are you doing? Don't look back. Giving it energy. Hey, John, you know, this whole place used to be covered by big fucking dinosaurs that were all over the place. They all disappeared, thousands of them. You know where they went? As time went by, they started to shrink. They got smaller. Smaller, and they started to grow wings. And they flew away, and now nobody knows where they are. That's a true story. - Sit down. Sit down. - There you are, sir. Just right. We're all done. Yeah, I'll get your jacket. Louie? - Well, I guess he isn't gonna show. - Let's see what you've got here. Did you do anything in town? Got some nice pieces here. - Raymond took a ride outside some bullshit town on the main line. - Wherever you been, I wouldn't go back there for a while. - Your place. Imagine having a house, just a house, like as far as the eye can see. - Hey, Ruby! - Hey, Johnny. - Hey, Ruby, this is my friend, Wesley. Hey, Wesley, that's my friend Ruby. - Hey, Ruby, how are you? I heard about you. I like rubies. - Listen, I got a lot of work to do. See you later. - Okay. Hey, Rube. - Thought you two were friends. - Yeah, sit down, man. What do you think? She's pretty, huh? - Hey. - I'll tell you something about women. I know them. I've studied them. You can't trust any of them. Women, not too many guys know this, are much stronger than guys. That's why I keep a distance. I keep a perspective. I use them, but I don't get involved with them. - Uh, I'll tell you something, Wesley. You know, I ain't never talked too much to girls. You know, I've been with them. You know, a lot of 'em. I mean, all kinds, man. I've been with old. Been with crazy ones. Fat ones, ugly ones. I mean, but I ain't never been with a real nice good one. - Good. That's hard to find. - I mean, I didn't even know what the fuck you're supposed to say to one. That Ruby, she's a good one. She's so pretty. - Get outta here. Go on. - Man, I'd just like to be able to look at her and just, just, I could just look at her and just hold her. I'd like her to just touch me. Just, you know, just touch me and have her like me, you know? - You know what Aristotle said? He said that in the beginning of the world, everybody, man, women, one creature, and that they were so powerful that way that the gods had to tear them apart. That ever since then, men-women, men-men, women-women, whatever it happens to be, roamed the earth in search of their other half. Huh? That's a good one. It's true. I'll see you later. - Hey, hey, hey! You stop that. - Yeah, man! I'm in. I'm in again. Oh! Oh, shit. He's on a roll. All right. Very good, man. - Hello? Yoo-hoo? Anybody home? Howdy, sports fans. - Hey, man. - Chateau norm de pots. - Whoo-hoo! - You remember Phyllis? - I can't believe I'm here. - Phyllis, I remember. - From Philadelphia. - How you doing? - Hi. - And Melanie. - Turn around and show our baby off. - And John, Johnny, meet the girls. The girls, Johnny. - Hi, Johnny cowboy. - Ooh! John, do not play Ray tiddlywinks, 'cause he cheats. - Hey, man, I don't cheat. When did I ever cheat? - You know, Ray, you got terrible hygiene. - I got terrible hygiene? - Motherfucker, you got terrible hygiene, Ray. I hate to remind you, but- Most people change their underwear. They brush their teeth at least once a day. - Oh, yeah? - Wipe their ass, take a shower, bath, whichever you prefer. Hey, girls, you want something to drink? - I want to play some music! - Come here, come here. I know what you want. Come here. - You know what I want? Oh, this baby. Come here. - Come here. I'll get you want you want. I know what you want. - Whoa! I brought these girls over here, hmm? Liven up the place. - A few more rocks. - Ah! Oh, that feels so good. - My lady. - Shit. - Get up! Get up, you bum! - Don't get up! Stay down, John! Stay down. Don't get up. - Get up! Get up! - Seven. Eight. Nine. - Stay down. - 10. Out. - How do you feel? - I think you ought to go see a doctor. I don't like what I saw tonight. - I got a good doctor. He's an acquaintance. Best in town. He owes me a favor. - Hey, man, I ain't gonna go see no doctor. - Listen, let me tell you this, every night is not your night. Some nights you just don't have it. Everything you do is wrong. I remember a time I fought a guy, Jim Donahue. Train hard. Live right. No sex. Hitting the road. I still end up losing the fight. So that's how it happens sometimes. - Come on. Come on. - May I walk with you a little bit? - What did you do to yourself? - Oh, I didn't do too good. - Jesus, I can't even look at you. You got to take care of yourself, Johnny. Come here. Let me look at you. - No. - I like your face. - Come on. - Look left. Please. Look right now. And your chin up, please. Look left. Left. Look to the right now, please. Right. You see a little blurry, no? - Yeah. - You can get dressed now. - Is it all right? - Yeah. Wesley, you know there is nothing I would not do for you, man. Huh? I've known you for a long time. I don't know what's going on. I don't know want to know what's going on, Wesley. If this guy was a younger fighter, which he is not... The beginning of his career, I would tell him to go find another type of work. I see this all the time. He should have stopped fighting years ago. If he's your friend, take him over to the hospital to see a neurologist. Run some tests. Because in my professional opinion, he has a fracture of the temporal bone. Okay? Now, the temporal bone is either going to unite or it's going to explode. Okay? Could be one punch, two punches. But the next time somebody hits this guy in the head, he could drop dead. - Well, doc says you should be fine. - Good luck, Johnny. - Thanks, man. - Thanks. - That doctor say anything? - You hungry? - Hey, wait a minute. That doctor say anything was wrong with me? - He says you shouldn't get hit in the head so much. I got an idea. I got something for us, something I want to show you. I want you to concentrate. I want to show you something. Right down here. You see that guy there? - Which one? - The little one with the attache case. - Yeah. - He's got stones in that bag worth maybe a million dollars. He deals diamonds. We grab those, we make ourselves a pretty good score, but we got to hit him at the end of the week on Friday when he's got all the volume. - So what's the problem? - You see the two guys on each side? Those are the bodyguards. That's the problem. If they get incommodatious, won't hand it over, we might have to get physical. Left hook action, straighten 'em right out. That's why I need you. You won't even have to whack them that hard, just a little bit. - They're Jewish, you know. I mean, you know how they are. They don't like to get hit. You know, they just like to count the money. - Be quiet. Don't be anti-Semitic. Please, okay? You understand? - I'll tell you something, though. They may look funny, but a lot of those sheenies have guns. - We just have to wait for the right time. I grab it. I run. How fast can you run? - Hey, listen, man, I can't run too fast. - I didn't think so. Well, don't worry about that. You just trust me, okay? I'm asking you for a favor. Doesn't take much. Just, bang. That's all. - What's Jewish? - Are you kidding? - You don't know what Jewish is, man? - Well, what's Jewish? - Jewish. That's Jewish. This whole neighborhood is Jewish. Look, I'll explain it to you later. That's not the point. I don't care. You just hit the guy. I grab it. I run. - You want me to hit the Jewish? - Yes. - Hey, man, I'll do anything for you, Wesley. - You make me crazy sometimes, you know that? Come on. Let's get out of here. - Hi, hon. - Hi. You want a little action? - You think I'm any different from you or anybody? I want the better things in life. I want a Rolls-Royce convertible. 50 silk suits, 100 pairs of custom made shoes, and handmade Chinese silk shirts the colors of the rainbow. And see, John, I'm originally from Savannah. That's Georgia. That's where I was, dropped off, so they tell me. I don't really know, because when you're a kid, they tell you so much shit you don't know what's real or not. They said I was blue when they found me, and I was real small, and I was found in a mailbox some time after midnight during the winter. Who's calling you? - I don't know, man. Must be a wrong number, huh? - Must be. But I've tried to better myself over the years. Oh, there have been obstacles and minor disappointments, but I very sincerely feel that my time is near. I don't even want to get even. That's bullshit. I say, forget the past, live in this moment. And I know something's out there calling my name. "Wesley. "Wesley, Wesley." It's all timing. It's the process of elimination. It's self-preservation. It all boils down to one thing. Take care of yourself. Because if you don't, you're just gonna die and be nobody. And, what's my point? All I need is one big score. - Thank you. - Hey, red. - Hey, creep. - How about a coke? - Sure. - Hey. Hey! Sheila's watching the place for me. You feel like taking a ride? Come on. Hmm. - Nice picture. - That's me and my dad. That's taken outside a place we used to go to breakfast. - That's nice. - Yeah. Yeah, I really miss him. - Where is he? - He died when I was really young. My grandpa raised me. - How'd he die? - Oh, he was out riding on his horse one day, trying to cross the train tracks that ran through our property. The train was coming, the horse spooked, he was thrown, and the train ran him over. Some batty old neighbor lady said he just sat there on the tracks, let the train hit him. He didn't even try to get up. - Well, maybe he didn't want to get up. Hey, man, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. - You didn't hurt my feelings. - Oh, goddamn. Hey, I ain't seen one of these for a long time. Man. I remember when I was a boy, I used to always ask my old granny for a nickel so I could ride on one of these. Every time we used to go to the big store, can I sit on it? - Yeah, sure. - Every time we used to go to the big store, I used to ask her for some nickels, and she'd give me a whole bunch of nickels to ride on the horses and get me candy. I really liked that. I spent a lot of time with my old granny. 'Cause my mother, she was, um, she was fuckin' nuts. And my old man, he just drank himself to death. And then my old granny died. They sent me to this place with all these boys like me. I didn't like them, man. I didn't like none of 'em. I always used to try to run back home. I just didn't know how to get there. Hey, Ruby? What's wrong? - I could lose everything. I've been working hard for a long time. I promised my pop I'd take care of this place. I don't want to let him down. - I understand. - I love the horses. They make me happy, Johnny. I don't want to lose it. - Hey. Hey. I want to help you. You want me to help you? Hey, I can help you. - You will? - Yeah, I will. I want to help you. - Will you just hold me? - So I think she likes you. Don't ask me why. I think you're a creep. I'm just kidding. You're just a little weird, that's all. That's all right. Everybody's weird. Who wants to be normal, anyway? - Hey, Lou. What are you doing here? - Never mind what I'm doing here. I've been looking for you every place. Where you been? All right, listen. I got you a 10-rounder. It's a last-minute thing. Franzetti, the kid from Philly that robbed you, he pulled out of the fight with Cotton. It's a very good purse. I mean, the money is there. If you want me to, Johnny, I can, I can line it up for you. - Cotton? - With Cotton. - Money good? - Oh, money is very good. - I'll take it. - All right, good. Cotton is our number one contender. This is a tune-up fight before the title fight. That's why they picked Franzetti. His guys feel they want to give him some work. To him, you're just, You know what I mean. Johnny, uh, listen, I got to be honest with you. I got to be fair. I think you need somebody who's sharper than me. Um, I've asked Bill to help us out and give us a hand. I think probably show Bill around the ring? - Hey, Bill, how you doing, man? - Hey, John. How you doing? - All right. - That's my man. - Well, hey, let's go to work. - Me and you, we're gonna do it. Body, body, hand. Come on, baby. Go down. Look out. Keep your left hand up, you can hit with the right hand too. All right, come on. Jab. Come on. That's it. Three punches. Quick. Come on. - Fuck. Fuck! - Come on. Don't quit now. Come on. - Bill, what are you working him so hard for? He doesn't know the difference between a left hook and road work. - Hey, Rube. - Howdy. - Hey, I'll get this. - Come on. There you go. That's my man. See what I mean? Use your head. Jab. Jab. Step over here. Step. Whoa. Thataway. - Fuck! - Come on. No, real low. Real low. Come on, push him off, punch him off. Don't push him off. Punch him. Get off, get off! Don't wait, don't wait for him to stop. Bring 'em up. Come on, baby. Drop down. Bring that shot up. Not too hard. Don't work too hard, baby. This is a sparring session. - Three people left? Boy, three other girls? But you're the number one girl, right? I bet. No? - Whatever. Hey, John. - Hey, Wesley, how you doing? - Bumblebee. You know, we got a problem. Friday is this Jew holiday, and I forgot, they're having a short week. We got to do this thing of ours on Thursday before they close up. - Yo, Wesley, man, I can't. I'm fighting on Thursday. - What are you talking about? It's all planned. Ho-ho. Don't do this to me. I need you. I mean, be there, John. Be there for me. I need you. - Man, I can't. - You can't? Hey! Let me tell you what you can't do, Johnny Walker. You can't fight no more. That's what the doctor told me. He said there's something wrong with you inside your head. He said the next time you get hit in the head, you could die. Hmm? That's what the doctor said. Hey, John, we're in this together, you know. I don't want to see nothing happen to you. I care about you. I'm counting on you. - Hey, Wesley. - Hey, man. Let's go. What's wrong? Son, what's wrong? - Hey, Bill, thanks, man. You know, I sure wish I would've run into you a long time ago. Maybe things could have worked out. You could have made me good, man. Hey, Bill, Bill. Hey, Bill, man, you think I could have been good? - Okay, fellas, you received your instructions in the dressing room. Johnny, you have any questions at this time? - No. - How about you, Sonny? - No. - Okay, shake hands now. Come out fighting at the bell. Take your corner. All right, seconds out. - Come on, give me some action! - Where you been? - Waiting for Johnny. He didn't show up. - He didn't? Fuck! We're gonna be late. - Look, look, maybe we should call off on it, huh? - It's all set up. I'm not calling it off. Did you get the other car? - Yeah. - We'll do it without him. - Okay, man. Whatever you say. - Get ready. - All right, let's break. Time! - Detecting a sneer across his face, as if he was saying, you have to be kidding me. I'm sure Walker doesn't think he's been kidding. Johnny didn't look like a movie star before the fight, and right now he looks like he's been through a paper shredder. - Here you go. - Thanks. - You can knock this guy out. He ain't got no heart. He got dog in it. So don't you quit now. You hear me? Huh? All right, let's do it. Suck it up. All right, Johnny? Let's go. - Come on! - There was a jab that was just short. Cotton countered with a right. No wasted motion. Johnny Walker's often the kind of fighter purists hate. If you'll excuse the expression, but Johnny Walker is very red right now. - Would you like anything else? - You got a washroom? - Yeah, it's in the back. - Walker who's from no man's, Arkansas, and unranked, is fighting against the number one super heavyweight contender of the world, and just seems out of his class right now. - Break! Break! - Give me two minutes, then pull up out front. - Hey, Wesley, you sure you want to do this? - Two minutes. - Sidesteps him, hits him right in the face, then knocks Walker backwards. - Oh, man! - He's smiling almost. He's almost smiling out at the crowd as if to say, you can't hurt me. - Break! Break! Let him out! - Nobody move. See that? It's real. Okay, get on the floor! Don't fool with me! - Bring 'em out. Is that the round? I heard the bell. - Take that stuff, put it in the case. Just put in the, I'm not fooling with you. You understand? Just put it in the bag, all right? What do you think I'm doing here? Come on, put it in the bag. Come on! Hurry up! Come on. Please, please. You fuck with me, I'll kill you. Nobody calls the police. I'm coming back. Son of a bitch. - Help! Help! Police! Help, help! Police! - Hey! - Whoa! Whoa! - Come on! Come on! - Over there. Stay there. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. How you feel? You okay? - Yeah! - Stop! Come on. Doc, take a look. Now, stay out there. - Let me see. Let me see. - I don't know what happened. - Let him take a look at it. Let him take a look. - Hold on. - Okay. Okay. Here we go. Time! Okay, that's it. Break it up. Come on. Cut it out. Let's go. Back to your corners. Take your corner. - What's wrong with you? Are you trying to blow this thing, man? - What's that fighting after the bell? All right, slick, you better cool this guy off. - All right, okay. Look at me. What are you trying to do? Blow the thing? - Step in. Step in with your jab and bust his damn nose. You know what I'm talking about? - Just don't worry about water. No water in the desert, baby. Come on. Give him a little water, Zeke. A little water, Zeke. - He's crazy. He won't go down. I hit and hit, and he don't go down. - Keep working him. A knockout will come, huh? Keep doing what you're doing. - Suck it up. Suck it up. Come on. - Okay, in the corner. Stay in the corner. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Back in that corner. Stay there. Six. Seven. Eight. Let's go. Back up, guys. Let go of the rope. - Yeah! Yeah! - Come on, Johnny. Come on. - Break! All right, let him up. All right, over there. Stay over there. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. All right, come on. Turn around. Let's go. All right, hold it. That's a slip. No knockdown. - Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Hang with it. All right. Head back. - Stand up. Get up. Come on, John. Come on, baby. Get up. - Three. Four. Five. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. - I'd like her to just touch me, you know? Just touch me and have her like me, you know?
