Now girls, We have a very big crowd tonight, okay? Boss said, please perform well tonight. This means that you have to perform with your heart and soul. And most of all, with your body. And remember, you are known as sexy models. But all of you are decent. You are all untouchables here at SP Nightclub. They cannot touch you whenever they want. You guys are not ordinary hostesses. You are not cheap. You are all true artists. Vanessa and Pamela, tell me the truth. Are you both pregnant? Are you pregnant? Do you even know who the fathers are? Come on, tell us the truth. That's not true? Where did you hear that? Where did you hear that nonsense? The Boss said you have to resign tonight if you are pregnant. Pregnant models are not allowed on stage. And boss said that you two are a disgrace. You are not honest, and sincere. You don't have the right to be SP models because you don't love your jobs. Why don't you be like Hanah, or Eva? Career first before men. Look at them, they're successful. Don't you envy Eva? The model's model. The one and only. The star. The queen. The best of them all. The super sexy. The true SP model. None other than Ms. Eva Baron. [upbeat music playing] [audience applauding] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] My friend, what can you say? Let's ask her to sit with us. - I'm afraid it cannot be, Winston. - Why? It might start trouble. Look, if she allowed one, others will follow. You always come here and still have not asked her to sit with you? You have never met her, or even talked with her? She's a dancer, not a prostitute. [upbeat music playing] [audience applauding] Dom, I need to meet her. Eva, let's eat first. It's still early. - If you want to be late. I'll go now. - I won't go if you won't go with me. Hi! I'm Winston Abad. Hi. I'm Hanah Rey. That's actually Reyes. What's your name? Dom. Dom Romero. Hi. Excuse me. We'll bring you home. - No, we have a taxi waiting. - We can bring you both home. - Oh no, I live in España and Eva's in... - Hanah. Can I visit you at home? I'm sorry Mr. Abad but when I'm home, I prefer to forget this job. I want to talk to you again. You don't want to sit with clients nor allow visits. And I especially hate being harrassed on the street, Mr. Abad. - What now? - Yeah, what? You just wanted to meet me, right? Now, it's done. - Good night. - Eva, it's already good morning. Goodbye. Allow me. [door thuds] [engine revving] You cannot play with that kind of woman, Winston. And why will I play with her? Don't laugh but I've fallen for her already. Really hard. Mom, it was Dom's birthday. He invited me out for some food and drinks. That's why you're home late? He invited you to a bar, didn't he? Mom, I'm old now. I did everything you wanted me to do. I've graduated already. I'm also managing our business. You're still under my roof. Don't scold me about it. I wanted to get out years ago, you didn't want me to. [engine revving] [door thuds] [door thuds] You were only with Dom for one night, and you learned how to quarrel with me. Mom, don't blame my friend. It was me who wanted to stay late. What's this all about? And you as well. Mom, watch your heart. Why are you late as well? Mom, there's no work today, okay? Cris and I worked overtime last night. We're working like a dog. And we entertained new Italian importers. They're interested in our new lines. Our bags, luggage, belts, and dresses, they're also interested. We'll bring in over millions to the company. Don't worry. You know we're only working just for you. So stop scolding us. Your brother started it. I was not able to sleep while waiting for him. He's starting to rebel. [music playing] [people chattering] [music playing] [people chattering] [people chattering] Hey, Chayo. Hi, Felipe. How are you? Hello, good evening! - Hi! - Hi! [giggles] Felipe, this is Dominador, my nephew. Son of Paquito and Amelia. - Welcome home, Dr. Esguerra. - Thank you. Dom, my goddaughter, Nellie. Hi, how do you do? Fine. Pleased to meet you. Come on, let's go in. Why not? Come on. [music playing] - Excuse me for a while. - Sure, go ahead. Hi girls, how are you? Are you enjoying the party? - Did you enjoy your food? - Of course. [people chattering] We'll usually, after work, all I can think of is get some rest. - Why don't you start the dance floor? - Maybe later. Hey, why are you not drinking? [people chattering] [people chattering] Let's dance later? I don't want to. - Excuse me. I'll be back. - Okay, bye. She's such a beautiful lady - Oh well, here she is. - Hi. Hi. I hope you'll be able to consider to stay longer this time. You know, she's such a talented girl. We need people like her here too. That's what I've been telling her. She's really beauty and brains, right? And very young. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [crowd applauding] Please help me. I need to have Eva. Sure... No problem. Did you see that costumer awhile ago? I hate how he looked at us. Maybe she went ahead of Hanah. Come on, let's go. Let's wait for a while. Here's the taxi. Eva. - You again? - Let me bring you home? No, thank you. I'm not a bad person. Eva, please. Mr. Abad, I do not go out with men. I won't bring you anywhere. I will just bring you to your house. Eva, I want to be friends with you. I've heard that before. Dom and I are different from them. Eva, I'm different. My first visit was just last night, this is my second visit. Because of you. I'm not used to talking to girls who work in nightclubs. You are the first. And you have impressed me, Eva. All of us are exposing our bodies to earn money. Earning a living is not a sin. Don't tell me that's how decent I look like to you? [door thuds] Eva, I know you're different. It's my first time If you're not convinced, I'm still single. Dom is an architect. He manages a construction company. Still single like me. Are you childhood friends? Classmates? No. Winston and I met when I did their building plans in Makati. I also designed and constructed their factories in Pasig. We are in the garments industry. We export ready made to the States, Europe, and the Middle East and everywhere else. Both of you are busy. Good thing you can still go to nightclubs. Well, he's the one who goes out a lot, Eva. Wait, if I'm not mistaken, you're the one who always sits near the stage. Right. I've been an SP patron since it opened. [chuckles] Good thing he convinced me to go with him the other day. Otherwise, I might not have met you. Eva, can I invite you for an outing? Sure, why not? But I'll bring a friend along. Perfect. So Dom can have a date. [pop music playing] [pop music playing] [pop music playing] [pop music playing] Your reports are good. Sales are great. I already talked to Carol. I will transfer her to the Makati branch to be with Winston. I will leave you alone to manage the factories in Pasig. That's good news, Ma'am. You really trust me that much? Even if Carol was not your girlfriend, with your good skills and loyalty, you're the only one I can trust to manage that company, I'm telling your boyfriend about my plans. Are you happy now? - Carol… - We'll be apart. No one will watch over you, control you, or meddle with your decisions. Carol, you're the one who suggested to be transferred to Makati. Mom, it's because he said I treat him like a machine, a robot. Mom, he doesn't really care. Wait, are you two arguing? Oh, no Ma'am. That's how we show affection. These kids. I'm surprised. Love? Affection? But Carol those are harsh words. You might lose Cris. Oh that won't happen. I'm here to tell you that I want to marry Carol. As soon as possible. - Cris… - See? He loves you. [radio playing] What will you do when our manager pushes through with resigning? We'll see. He'll resign from the club and go abroad. What will happen to us if the SP models disbands? And if eventually the club also closes, let's also go abroad. Let's apply as models, or dancers in Japan. I don't want that anymore, Hanah. How about if we apply as domestic helpers? In Hong Kong, or Singapore? Or the Middle East. We only finished high school. They only accept college graduates. And I'm afraid to leave the Philippines. Don't tell me you have plans to go back to the province? Shall we go fishing again? Or dive for sea creatures? I'd rather do that than... being a prostitute after quitting SP modelling. I'd rather die first. You're talking like that because you have supporters left and right. - What? - Who is closer to your heart? Is it Winston, or Dom? [chuckles] But you know Eva, whoever you choose, you're be lucky eitherway. Both single, decent, and rich. - Get married already! - Hanah, Winston and I are together. But he has not offered marriage. Dom is Winston's companion. Help and aid, but he's not my suitor. He's only Winston's messenger and shock absorber. But he loves you. - What? - It's obvious. You're just oblivious. I envy you. You have strong walls to rely on. Give me the other one. Hey, stop it. Somebody might hear you. - Bye. - Bye. Bye Eva. I'll go ahead. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye Winston, take care of Eva. - Okay, Hanah. [door thuds] [door thuds] [romantic piano synth] Thank you. You will leave this job and never come back. How will I survive? Winston, I don't know any other job besides this. When you'll be my wife, you don't have to work anymore. Wife, or mistress? [door thuds] [ominous music playing] I'll marry you, Eva. [ominous music playing] [dramatic music playing] [door thuds] Sorry for troubling you. I know you have lots of work to do. I only invited you to show my paintings. I need a break. I've been working so hard. So many compromises. I had a feeling. That's why you disappeared from our party. Sorry for that. I was not able to say goodbye. I escaped from Auntie. I had an important business. Nellie, you looked for me that time? I told myself, "that's it." That's the first and last time we'll meet. That's how it is. You're fatalistic. No, I'm realistic. When two things or people are not for each other, they shouldn't be forced to be together. I recalled something because of what you just said. My friends. For example, Willy, Emily, and Danny. Danny first met Emily. He instantly fell in love with her. One day, he introduced his friend Willy to Emily. He wanted to boast to his friend about her. But he was surprised when Willy fell in love with Emily too. Willy courted Emily without even asking Danny who she is in his life. Willy got Emily to fall in love with him. Danny lost the girl. In simple terms, They are not for each other. And they're not meant for each other. They can't be forced together. In your story, are you Danny? Ah... Nellie, it hurts. Anyway, I still believe that time heals. And that someday, my fate will come. Or maybe it already arrived. [busy street ambience] Hi Winston. Cris! Carol! Is she the one? Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. My sister Carol and my soon to be brother-in-law, Cris Montilla. - Hi. - She's Eva. Eva Baron. Hello. Hi. Hi. Winston, why don't we have snacks? I'm not hungry. And you know, it takes me a long time to buy jewelries. Shall we go ahead of you, then? - Yeah, that's a good idea. - Let's go. - Okay. See you. - See you Cris. - Cris, I have a bad feeling about this. - Carol? Her name alone makes me already suspicious. Like a cheap movie star. We need to do something about this. I pity my brother. [engine revving] [gate creaking] [door thuds] [door thuds] [door thuds] Come, Eva. Isn't it embarrassing for me to visit? Of course not. They've been waiting. [knocks on door] - Sir, your mom is in the living room. - Thanks, Tisha. [door thuds] Good evening, Ma'am. Let's go. - Mom, this is… - Eva Baron? I thought there are a lot of visitors tonight. I told you a white lie. You're the only special visitor. I want to surprise you. It's embarrassing to invite now that you're here. They said you are a model? Not a fashion model, or a commercial model... A burlesque model. That get naked on stage, and is touched by anybody. - You sell yourself to anybody. - Mom! A cheap woman. I'm not that cheap. Winston can prove it. He's crazy and blind about you now. And you are taking advantage of him. - Who told you these things? - I did. When Winston introduced you to me, I had a bad feeling about you. You are an ambitious social climber, gold digger, and woman of the streets. A private investigator followed you as well Ms. Baron. Tell me, how much are you worth? Leave my son alone. - Don't be shy. - That's right. Does a hypocrite burlesque dancer know how to be shy? Carol... Why? [pensive music playing] Eva! Eva! [sobs] Leave me alone. - Stop it, stop it. - Let go of me. Eva, please stop. Go back to your family! I brought you here, so I'll bring you home as well. I can't leave you. I know what I'm doing. I'm marrying you, not them. [pensive music playing] Eva and I will live together but we'll keep it a secret from Mom. Dom, help us. Look for a house. Eva will resign from the club. She will just stay at home. She'll be living in a separate house. But, I'll still go home, so mom won't be suspicious. I'll tell them that I've broken up with Eva. After work, I'll go to her. I'll leave before midnight and come home so they won't notice. In other words, you will keep Eva from your mom and your sister? That's the only way for him to give in to his mom without us separating. Well, they pushed you to do these things to them. Dom, I have to be practical. Good thing you understand, Eva. We cannot live decently if I'll lose my job. I need that position at work. When will you get married? When I have saved enough already. When I don't need help from them. They can forget about me. And remove me from their will. As long as you are mine. [pensive music playing] - Dom. - Winston. Eva and I need you. We really need your help. Just tell me. [pensive music playing] [vehicle approaching] [engine revving] Wow. [chuckles] [bright music playing] [bright music playing] Your friend Hanah is unfair. She promised she'll help you with the house. She called me and said she's sorry. It just so happened that her interview is today. Why is she also leaving the club? Hopefully Dom. So she can go to Japan and work there as a model too. In our old club, we do look high class but there's just too many of us. Aside from it having too many rules, the pay is also low. Then she should also just get married. No one's courting her? Someone serious? She's not lucky with men. When I first met you guys. I don't like hanging out with men. I was scared. But that all changed when met you guys. - Thank you! - Oh my. [chuckles] [music playing] You take care. You might get hurt. [music playing] [metal clanks] - Dom. - Yes? Will you still go to the club? I'm not sure. Maybe. Let's see. Why did you ask? Nothing. To be honest I miss the club, but I don't want to work there anymore. I hope I made the right decision. I'm not really doing anything bad because I'm not a mistress because he's single. Second, he said he will marry me. Why am I acting so defensive? Dom... Winston loves me, right? And... I also love him. That's what's important. And he even chose to betray his own family. Just so you guys won't be separated. What else can you call that? You are a true friend, Dom. I wonder what it's like when you're not around. [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [vehicle approaching] [soft music playing] [door thuds] - Hi. - Winston! [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [chuckles] Good luck, Good health, God bless you. Accoding to the song. Cheers to Mr. and Mrs. Abad. A wedding party for three. A wedding without a priest. Let's go to the stove and I'll bless you guys there. [laughs] Oh it's almost ten. Time for me to go. I'll go ahead. I know you'll still stay until 12 midnight. And I know you guys still have a lot of things to talk about. You really need to go now because you're disturbing us. [laughs] Good night. Eva, if you need anything, you can just call me anytime. Use a long distance call, anytime. Wait, you forgot something. - What is it? - Aren't you going to kiss the bride? [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [doorbell ringing] [doorbell ringing] [door thuds] Oh! Dom, come in. - Have you eaten dinner? - Yes. - What happened to you? - Nothing. I'm just tired. Have a seat. I'll get you a drink. [soft music playing] [soft music playing] I was about to go to bed and I just heard the doorbell. Were you waiting for my call? It's fine. Sorry I couldn't call you long distance. I said it's fine. I just came to say hi, I'll be leaving soon. I don't want to disturb your dad. He's not here. He's out of town for a medical conference. Dom, why? [soft music playing] [dramatic music playing] Eventually, you'll get used to our setup. But you have to prepare yourself. Winston? I thought I shouldn't go here every day so that mom and Carol won't notice. I almost forgot to tell you, Carol and Cris are getting married soon. When this happens, that's one less evil person in my life. But the bad news is… Mom is planning to transfer her to my company. When that happens, I need to be more careful of my moves. For example sweetheart, we can no longer call each other that much on the phone. That really is bad news. For you. Winston? I can't give you a check because the villians in my life might trace it. [laughs] [laughs] - [laughs] - What's funny? I'm just not used to this kind of setup. So this is what it's like to be mistress number two. I mean, number three. What are you talking about? It's true. Number one is your mom, number two is Carol and I'm number three. [laughs] Two weeks from now will be Cris and Carol's wedding already. What's the exact date that you chose again? On the 12th, mom. Just in time, because my friend Patria is coming home tomorrow. And hopefully by the time comes, you'll get to know Leah better. Who is that? Why is she part of this conversation? Leah is the only daughter of Madam Patria. They live abroad. So? She is going to be the bridesmaid in your sister's wedding. I want you to take care of her while they are here. And I'll be incharge of my friend. And tomorrow go with me to the airport to pick them up. I can't go tomorrow, mom. I have many business meetings. - Winston, it's just a small favor. - I want you to meet Leah. For you to forget that sexy model you're crazy about. That's enough, that's over now. Why don't you just say it straight you want to set me up with Leah? Good thing you realized. You'll be thankful once you get to know her. [laughs] Here. Is there anything else you guys need? Wow, our waitress is even from abroad. I'm good. What about you? This is enough. We can't really drink much. - Thank you Hanah. - Welcome. How's your project bro? I'm having such a hard time. My client keeps changing his mind. I have to redo my drawings again. How about you? Well, to tell you frankly, I'm the happiest man in the world. Thanks to you. Be honest with me, Eva. Are you happy with this kind of life? At first I was having a hard time, but I got used to it eventually. How about when you're alone? You just end up talking to yourself? Sometimes. I don't think I can live like this, Eva. All day waiting and you're not even sure when he will come. And when he comes, he'll just use your body and good night. - Goodbye, until next time. - Hanah! Please don't get mad at me. I just can't stop myself from saying it. I really wanted to ask you this even before I left for Japan… What is it? What's the feeling after Winston uses you in the bed, - he gives you money before he leaves. - That's enough! Are you not the same with me and the rest of the other girls? Hanah, I'm not a prostitute. I'm not a mistress. The only difference is you're private, and I'm for public consumption. I thought you're my friend. That's the only reason I'm being honest with you. Hanah, I'm happy. That's good, at least now I'll be at peace. [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [soft music playing] I told you to wake me up before 12 midnight. It's already past one! If you only know what it's like to drive in the highway at this hour. I hate this life! [clattering] Here… [clattering] [door thuds] [door thuds] [soft music playing] [muisc building up] [lady speaking on PA] [crowd chattering] - Winston, that's them over there. - Hi! Hello! [crowd chattering] There they are. How are you, my friend? - This is Cris. - Welcome. - He's Carol's boyfriend. - Hi auntie. - This is Winston, my son. - Hi. - And this is my daughter, Leah. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. How are you? - This is Winston. - Hi. [crowd clamoring] [crowd clamoring] - Okay? - Okay. [soft music playing] [crowd chattering] I don't want to go back to America anymore. It's too cold there, and it's bad for my arthritis. [laughs] And I want Leah to just finish her studies here. - That's good. - She'll take her master's here. Wait a minute, where are they anyway? Oh right. Don't look for them anymore. I'm sure, they're just getting to know each other better. It's good that you still know to speak Filipino. My friends in America are also Filipinos. Some of them are Americans though, some Chicanos, and Puerto Ricans. And my mom even has her regional accent. She even talks to the sales ladies in Macy's in Filipino. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm sorry. I just remembered someone. You look like her. Who? She's also sweet and caring but... But she's beautiful, not like me? But you are decent. You have class. And who ever says that you are not beautiful is crazy. You are fast. Filipinos are fast when they want to court a girl. Are you already courting me? [soft music playing] [running water] [romantic music playing] [romantic music playing] [romantic music playing] [romantic music playing] [romantic music playing] - Winston? - Yes? Do you still think about her? Who? Eva Baron. - How did you know that? - Your mom told me all about her. If you didn't mention her right now, I wouldn't have remembered. - Really? - Yes. What'll happen if you'll see her again? [romantic music playing] We have other things to talk about. - Why does it have to be her? - You're changing the topic. It's very obvious that you still think about her. [romantic music playing] [soft music playing] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello? Winston! Darling! I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number. Winston? Why don't you change your number already? So no wrong number can call your direct number. There was even one call asking for a funeral parlor. Are these all done? I'll continue working on it in my office? Okay. [door thuds] [phone ringing] Hello? Eva? Is there a problem? I called Winston. and he said, I dialed the wrong number. He even called me "sir." He must have not been alone in his office. - Maybe Carol or his mom was there. - I guess so. Dom. I'm so bored here already. It's been a week since he last visited me. Dom Do you know what really happened to Winston? Can you please tell me? Nothing Eva. I'm just very busy these past few weeks, that's why I couldn't visit too. Don't worry, I'll visit you soon. Thank you, Dom. [cars revving, honking] Have pity on her, bro. She sounded so desparate on the phone. Dom, as you can see, I'm very busy. If that's the case, you don't visit her anymore? My business is really doing good these past few months and it's never been like this. A lot of money is coming in because of a lot of business deals. I hope Eva understands that I'm doing this for her and for our plans. She just misses you and you seem to be neglecting her. Of course not. She's well provided for. I give her a lot of money everytime. We're not talking about money here. Hi Dom. Carol. - Good thing you came to visit. - Hi Carol. It's been a while. - That's right. - So Dom... Just tell the interested investor when my schedule clears up next week, I can visit them. Investor? The one from the province. Oh right. But I hope, the sooner the better. Sarturday? Dom, you know my schedule is swamped. Dom is putting in a deal for the company. But you see, my plate is full right now. Because you've been going out. Dom, don't leave yet, okay? I want to introduce to you the girl are paring up for your friend. And I almost forgot Carol and Cris wanted to give you this invitation. Why are you giving it just now? So unreliable. - The twelveth. Sunday. - Yes. - Hi guys. - Leah. Are you having an important meeting? No, it's alright. Meet your boyfriend's bestfriend. Dom Romero. - Meet Leah Monserrat. - Hello. Hi. So it's you? I've been curious for a long time. So you're Winston's partner in crime. Oh, you should join us this weekend, we're going out of town. Want to join Winston and I? Okay I'll try. When I have the time. Let's go to my room. Excuse us, guys. I have new clothes to show you. I got it for a bargain price. Come, I'll show you. [door thuds] You want to come? It's a meeting of big manufacturers. Winston's company is really hitting it big these days. That's why he's hoping you would understand. I just wish I can talk to him even on the phone. Carol's watching over him at work. His mom is the same to him when he's at home. You're not the only one who's having a hard time. Sacrifices must be done. [glass cup clinks] Okay, so I'll go ahead. I'm sure after his meeting, he will go straight here. If you need anything, just call me. I'll go ahead. [metal chair clanks] Carol's wedding is near. When they leave for their honeymoon, he'll have plenty of time for you, because nobody's watching him anymore. Your schedule with him will be back to how it is before. Eva… The twelveth. That's on a Sunday. - That's my birthday, Dom. - Is it? I can't even spend my birthday with him. Such bad luck. I won't see Winston, and even Hanah is not here. [Alabok sa Ulap Performed by: Ali Sotto] - Let's eat. - Why are you asking me? - It's up to you. - Where do you want to eat? I don't mind eating anywhere as long as I'm with you. [chuckles] [door thuds] [honking, cars revving] [door thuds] [engine starting] [engine revving] [dramatic music playing] Can we go out late? I mean tonight? Sure. I'll just call you, - then let's meet somewhere else. - Okay. It's a date. - Excuse me. - How could you? Eva please. Don't make a scene here. It's embarrassing. You're the one who should feel embarrassed! You're just every guy, you're a liar! Cheater! - Come on, I'll bring you home. - Let go of me. - Let's go! Come on. - You're an animal! Miss, please stop that. Winston, who is she? It's better if we leave now Leah. - Let's go eat somewhere else. - Wait, we're still talking. What is wrong with you? Why are you bothering my boyfriend? Okay Eva. I will go to the house, and let's talk later. Let's go, Leah. I'm not done yet! I was just doing my own thing. I was single. I was chaste and decent, even if I was working in the club. You were the only one I trusted with my heart, and my body. I gave everything to you. Then you locked me in a house, all alone. You even promised me marriage. There I was, all day waiting for you to come home. I was just waiting for nothing because of this girl you are with! Enough with your drama! [sobs] [sobs] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] Why are you also mad at me? You knew everything! No. Even before, you already knew what his plans were for me. You knew that he was just going to fool me. And you're just pretending you don't know anything! Please let me explain first, Eva. - Eva... - Why Dom? You think you can fool a person like me? [sobs] Hanah and I are merely just dust. And people like us are always being stepped on. While you rich people, are at the top. You're above the clouds. Because we are nothing compared to you guys. [sobs] [dramatic music playing] It's a pity. I loved Winston, and I considered you a friend. But you turned me... You turned me into a whore! I'm not a whore! I'm not a whore! I'm not a whore! [dramatic music playing] Can you leave? Let's just talk about this some other time. Or better yet, never. You should marry Eva, Winston. My mom is right. We're not meant to be. You bastard. You only used Eva! You played with her, until you got sick of her! You just used her! Just say whatever you want to say. And if you're done, leave. - You are coming with me. - Stop it! I knew it! You were the one who told Eva about Leah. That's why she followed us that day. Well, you can have Eva now. Dom. Winston. What's the meaning of this? I knew it, they're still in contact with Eva Baron. Let's go inside. It's their problem. I can't do that, Cris. Winston is my brother. Dom, tell us what's going on. You better leave now. Your son over here turned me into a pimp. He secretly housed Eva, he even promised her marriage, and now… - Dom! - Winston! That's enough! - Stop it! - Leave and never come back. You're not my friend! [ominous music playing] [engine revving] [door thuds] [door thuds] [door thuds] Winston asked us to go here and get back all the things he gave you. He only gave me a few jewelries and a few clothes. Here, you can have it back. Wow, look at these clothes, mom. She really stole a lot from us judging from these. If my son stayed with you longer, you could've gotten more things. Look at all these furnitures. They're all first class. This house was already fully furnished when we rented it. Oh really? Why don't you ask Winston about it? - How come he won't show himself to me? - He finally realized. That he no longer wants to be tricked by your charms. He was the one who tricked me. He destroyed my life! He owes me big time. How dare you! You should be thankful that you felt what it's like to be rich. He upgraded your lifestyle a bit and made you at least step on the clouds. You're a nobody! You're just a speck of dust. Get out of here! - Open this! - And why? I want to see what's inside. You might have stolen something. - I'm not a thief! - How can I be sure? How dare you, you bitch! Unbelievable. You better know who you're fighting against! Let's go, Carol. Don't stoop down to her level. [ominous music playing] [dramatic music playing] [door thuds] [door thuds] [engine starting] [engine revving] You'll pay for this, Winston. I swear... you and your family will pay for what you've done to me. Today may be your day, but tomorrow will be mine. [wedding church music playing] [crowd applauding] [crowd applauding] [wedding church music playing] [crowd applauding] [birds chirping] Hi. Hi. Good thing you are here. Look, I was just reading the papers. That's your friend, right? Before. This guy has no shame. Bastard. Sorry, did I ruin your day? I was just curious why you didn't attend his wedding. And you were not even his best man. I didn't know he was getting married. He didn't invite me. But it's okay. Even if he invites me, I won't go anyway. Not me. Whatever happened to you guys seems serious. Juice? Is it because of a girl? Is it because of Eva Baron? [soft music playing] Yes, Nellie. It's because of Eva Baron. He met her because of me. Back then I didn't get a chance to tell her I was in love with her. Then Winston made her fall in love with him. He used her, played with her, and got sick of her. Eva got mad at me too, because I was Winston's accomplice. Do you still love her? [soft music playing] Dom. I have to know. [paper rustles] Yes. Until now? What you don't know can't hurt you. Eva is gone. I haven't heard from her for a long time. [soft music playing] [curtain rustles] Can you close that? It's hurting my eyes. Why did you open it? Ma'am, I thought you needed more light, it's already morning. Just close it. [curtain rustles] Pong. Let's go. I couldn't sleep all night waiting for you. So that's why I was so unlucky. Let's go! Cris, let go of me! - Let's go now! - Just let me be! Please! Let me go! What do you want? We don't even eat together anymore. Even sleep together. I'm bored! Can't you see? I'm a bored housewife. - Give that to me, and get out. - Carol. Shit. So this is where you waste the company's money. This is my money. I'll be the one liable for this to your mom. Then tell my mom the reason why I'm like this, is because you are neglecting me. I'm not working just for me. - Who are you kidding? - Carol! You are working so hard because you want to be rich! And you are using me for your ambition to be rich! The very reason why you married me, and I was too blind to see it. Why did I marry an ambitious social climber like you? Why did I even marry you anyway? He's acting up again. Come on girls, let's play. [upbeat music playing] [crowd chattering] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] - Hi. - Hi. Can you please help me? Hey! I heard that you don't want to dance anymore? We may not be earning much, but it's a living. Why stop? That's not true, Hanah. Better watch the dance that I'll do tonight. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [crowd applauding] [crowd applauding] [slow music playing] [crowd chattering] Sir, you can take her out. - Thank you, sir. - Sit down please. Hi. What would you like to drink? Maybe later. Small world. Small world, Mr. Montilla. Cris. I thought you wouldn't recognize me. I almost didn't. [lighter clicks] Did you go here for me, Cris? I just wanted to unwind. Why in this kind of place? I'm used to these kinds of places. My taste just changed when I hangout with the Abads. Aren't you going to ask about Winston? Don't say bad words, Cris. To be honest, I have buried that in the grave already. Is it true that customers can take you out now? If you'll take me, you'll be my first. [slow music playing] [glass clinks] You're here already. - Good morning. - You just got here? Yeah. How much money did Cris give you? Wow! I'm sure you had a hard time pleasing him in bed. On the contrary. He didn't even touch a finger tip. We didn't even go to the motel. Then what did you guys do? We just drank alcohol. We talked, mostly about our problems. Looks like he has marital problems. Really? Did he say anything about Winston? Yes. But I lied to him by saying I've forgotten everything. Hanah. I need to get Cris. Are you going to use him to get back at the Abad family? Not only that, Hanah. When I get him to like me, I'll be hitting two birds with one stone. First, I'll use Cris for money. And second, I'll use him to get back at Carol. She was one of the people who belittled me. But what if you fall for Cris? Then you'll go crazy again like what happened with Winston. I'm practical now, Hanah. I want to become rich. I won't fall in love anymore. I just want money. I really want to separate from Carol, But... I feel guilty, because I owe her dad big time. I know her too well. I know she'll make my life miserable, and destroy me. So I will just wait for the time that she wants to leave me instead. I know that time will come. In the meantime, what I'm looking for is… A woman? [intimate music playing] That can replace Carol? That's you, Eva. [intimate music playing] [engine stopping] [door thuds] [door thuds] [door thuds] [metal gate creaks] [metal gate creaks] [door thuds] Come in, and sit down first. Wait a sec. Go ahead and sit. Eva, come over here. We have a guest. Eva! Hurry up! Dom's here. We saw each other while buying fruit! He also buys there. I'll grab you something to drink. Wait a minute. Oh, we don't have any soda! I'll go buy some at the store. I'll be back fast. You just stay here, okay? Good thing you haven't left yet. I... - Hanah told me about… - I'm leaving tomorrow. Why Eva? Why are you commiting the same mistake again? Just mind your own business, Dom. You're not my boyfriend. Why does it have to be with the same family that cheated on you? I still have many things to do. I'm not even done packing my things. Why with Cris? He's married. - I love him. - Bullshit. Why are you making things even worse for you? Fine, you're implying I'm bad? Then tell it to me straight! Have you forgotten, Dom? Who pushed me to be like this? It was Winston, and you! It was people like you. You guys were the one who taught me how to be like this. Let me explain myself. What you're accusing me of isn't true, Eva. That I'm Winston's accomplice. The truth is... - The reason why I helped-- - You better leave now. You are no different from Winston. You're both animals! Asshole! [soft music playing] [ominous music playing] [engine revving] [metal gate clinks] [door thuds] [door thuds] Bring the luggages inside, Ador. - Sir. - Help Ador with her things. I didn't know there are people here already. They are your helpers. Don't worry, they don't know anything. I don't like you to be alone when I'm not here. Is this house okay with you? Your home, our home. Do whatever your heart desires. Just in case my wife and her family finds out, then don't worry. Don't be scared, because there's no need to be. But of course, it's better if things are quiet. I hope that I'll be separated from my wife, before they find out. I will be careful, Cris. - Do you like it? - Yes. [chuckles] I have to go. I have a meeting with some exporters this afternoon. I will just go back tonight after office hours. It's going to be regular. - It's blank? - You can write any amount. You trust me this much? Because I want this relationship to last for a long time, Eva. Bye. [birds chirping] [ominous music playing] Yes, this relationship needs to last, Cris. Until your wife has nothing. [bottle clinks] It's a miracle that you are home and not gambling. And you? Why did you go home? Tell me, is there someone else? I don't want to fight. I have very little patience these days. That's why don't start a fight with me. Just be thankful I came home. Why are you hurting me like this? Are you the only one who knows how to hurt people? You'll regret this. I've been regretting our marriage for a long time now. - You're ungrateful! - I'm grateful, Carol. That's just the very reason why I'm still staying in this relationship. Because I'm grateful for your father. [birds chirping] [birds chirping] [soft music playing] [birds chirping] [soft music playing] I'm sorry. It's been too long since my last visit. It's okay. I was busy anyway. I'm trying to finish all my paintings for my exhibit. And after my exhibit, we might not see each other anymore. What do you mean? I'm going back to Europe. My dad already said yes. Why, Nellie? I've already decided, Dom. That you are not meant for me. Don't worry, I'm used to getting hurt like this. I told you I'm different. For me, I will let go of the one I love as long as he is happy. They said martyrs no longer exist, but I said it's possible, if you're longing for true love. Dom, did you even like me at least? Even just a litlle? [soft music playing] [music building up] Carol. Did you tell Cris about this? Yes, I told my secretary to call him before I went here. - My goodness, you two. - Wait. I've been gone too long. Did something bad happen to you and Cris? Tisha, bring water for Winston. - Leah, more wine? - No more. If we waited for him, we might have starved to death. Is it true that Leah is pregnant? Yes, it's positive. Why? Are you jealous? I'll be a hypocrite, if I say no. Carol, if you want, I can bring you to my doctor in the States. He's very good and can perform miracles. The problem is not with her. Mom… I'm sorry, folks. I'm really sorry. It's good that you didn't wait for me. I had an emergency conference, because my men are planning a strike. Hi Winston. Welcome home. Leah. Sorry, I interrupted your conversation. - It's okay. You were our topic anyway. - Mom… Leah is pregnant, and I'm going to be a grandmother soon. I don't think Carol will get pregnant anytime soon. I said, the problem isn't with Carol. - It's because of-- - Because of me! Mom… Do we really need to talk about this here? And why not? I'm sure you want to tell me that I'm being rude. But Cris, are you forgetting something? This is my house. I am the one who makes the rules here. I will do whatever pleases me. I know you and Carol are just pretending to be in good terms. I know that both barely see each other and no longer talk to each other. You both are no longer together and don't even sleep together anymore. Then how will you two have a kid? That's why I said the big problem is you. You are cheating on my daughter, aren't you? You're fooling my daughter! Why won't you answer? You ungrateful man! I can easily throw you in the trash where you belong! Say whatever you want. [ominous music playing] [engine revving] [ominous music playing] [gate clanks] [door thuds] [door thuds] Yes? - Is she home? - Yes. [metal gate creaks] Who are you? What do you need? Our boss might get mad at us. I am your true boss. I am Mrs. Montilla. It's okay. Let her in. - Come in, Mrs. Montilla. - You? Yes me. - Eva? - Eva Baron. [chuckles] Does it hurt? Ma'am. Ma'am. - Let go of me. - Just let her. You are using my husband to get back at my family. Your husband is also using me to get back at you. - So we're even. - Liar! Too bad, if Cris was here, he'd tell you the truth. He told me the whole story. The bad things that your family does to him. The way you threaten him. [scoffs] Your family are all the same. You all look down on people. You're greedy. You use people! And him? And how about you? Now who is using who? You are getting money that belongs to us. I'm just asking what belongs to me, Carol. We don't owe anyone anything! Winston made a fool out of me. Even if your money runs out, that's still not enough. What are you so proud of, Eva? We all have dreams in life. Unfortunately, you only get what you deserve. You're right. That means, you'll just be wasting your tears. Because you lost the man who made the mistake of loving you. What a pity. Cris is a good person. [dramatic music playing] [moans] [moans] - Winston… Winston… - Please forgive me. Winston? Eva! You animal! You animal! That's enough! [sobs] [ominous music playing] [sobs] [ominous music playing] [ominous music playing] [soft music playing] [soft music playing] Eva. Eva. [ominous music playing] [ominous music playing] You bastard! - You're a bastard! - That's enough! You called me Eva multiple times already! You lied to me so many times. I thought you already forgot that whore. I let go of all your lies but you continue to make a fool of me. I know she's the reason why you wanted to go back to the Philippines. So you know! Then stop nagging! You bastard! - Stop it! That's enough! - You're an animal! [engine revving] [tire screeching] [screams] [car crashing] [siren wailing] - BP? - Zero BP. [dramatic music playing] Pupils are dilated and non-reactive. I'm sorry. Leah! Why my daughter? Why? [dramatic music playing] [machine beeping] Mom, where's Leah? [machine beeping] How is she? She'll be okay. She's alright. So you have to get better, okay? She's better now. Mom, Eva… I want to talk to her. Please look for her. [coughs] [machine beeping] I want to ask her forgiveness. Please help me. [machine beeping] Mom, please look for her. Please, mom. [machine beeping] [coughs] I've been waiting for this all my life. That the sky will stoop down to the earth, and the clouds will fall down and mix with the dust. Have mercy on Winston. Why? Did he even care about me before? How about you, Madam Mona? Did you ever pity me? Do you even know how to pity people like me? My son loves you. Your name is the first thing he said when he woke up. He probably realized his mistakes but too bad, it's already too late for that. Madam Mona, you and Carol attacked me last time, stepped on my dignity, and crushed my soul. I told myself that love is just an illusion, because there's a person like Winston Abad in this lifetime. That there is a Madam Mona, and a Carol in this world. I promised myself that one day, people like Winston Abad won't always get lucky. People like Madam Mona, and Carol will one day pay for what they did. Someday they will realize that they need an Eva in this world. Madam Mona... That Eva Baron is priceless. Eva, please have mercy. If I need to kneel infront of you, I will… Yes go kneel. [dramatic music playing] [ominous music playing] [dramatic music playing] Madam… [dramatic music playing] [machine beeping] [door thuds] [machine beeping] [door thuds] [machine beeping] [machine beeping] Eva... I know I owe you a lot. I know that no punishment will be enough for what I have done to you. I was weak. But here until my last breath, I want you to know that you are the only woman I have ever loved. I hope you can forgive me for what I have done to you. I love you, Eva Baron. [machine beeping] [machine long beep sound] [ominous music playing] [flatline sound] [dramatic music playing] [door thuds] Winston! Winston! What's the meaning of this? I'm returning all the money you gave me. Nothing more, nothing less. I gave that to you. Please tell Carol I'm returning everything that belongs to her. These are mine. Eva, everything I gave you, was not stolen from my wife. - Then all the more I can't take any of it. - Eva… Cris. If I accept any of these, it will only mean that I'm really a whore. I only went with you because... I wanted to take revenge on the Abad Family. [sobs] You also helped me. Please take it. How will you survive? I will work hard like you, Cris. [dramatic music playing] Are you going back to the club? I don't know… Eva, you can learn how to love me. You're so kind to me, Cris. But we've reached our end. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] I used water color here. Ma'am, I'll take your picture. - Sure. - Come on. Ready… Smile. [camera clicks] Thank you. Very nice. I don't understand anything about paintings, but I like this. [camera clicks] Your paintings are really nice. - Good evening, Sir. - Good evening. - Hi Nellie. - You're late. Why are you late? Nellie has been waiting. - No, it's okay. - Can I talk to you? Sure. Excuse us. Okay. What is it? Nellie, I hope you understand. I wasn't even planning to show up anymore. I have been thinking, and I don't know how to tell you… I asked myself, do I deserve to marry a nice girl, just to forget my heartache? [dramatic music playing] Nellie. Dom I'm sorry. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [passport thuds] [suitcase thuds] [lock clicks] [engine revving] - Be in charge here okay? - Yes sir. [door thuds] Why? I already left all the papers and Power of Attorney to Fred. I'm leaving all our properties to you. You can do whatever you want. You can even sell it. Cris, is it okay if I call, or message you? I'm sorry, I'll be late. Do you really have to do this? Cris, when I go to the States, I'll call you. We can go out for dinner. I'll accept, of course, If I'm not busy... If I don't have a date. Cris… I love you too much. I hope you said these things before. Anyway, I hope whenever we see each other again, we've both have changed. [dramatic music playing] Excuse me. Let's go, Ramon. Come on. [engine revving] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [upbeat music playing Is Miss Baron here? Yes. But you can't go inside, sir. Okay, Arnel and I will just watch outside. - Okay. - Let's go honey. Okay bye! - Hanah, how are you? - Dom! I'm good. Let him in. He's a friend. Come in, Dom. - By the way, my boyfriend Arnel. - Hi. This is Dom. He's our friend. He's a bachelor, he doesn't have much money, but he's full of love. Isn't that right, honey? Go ahead, go inside already. Just a minute, I'll check if they're ready. So handsome. [door thuds] Can I talk to you? We have nothing else to talk about, Dom. Don't worry, I'm no longer mad at you. I've already forgiven you. Let's just forget everything that happened. It's just a bad dream. So, that's why we have nothing to talk about anymore. Okay? Excuse me. Just a minute, why are you always avoiding me? How come you gave everyone a chance but me? I'm not Winston's accomplice. I didn't know that he will just play with you. To be honest, I shouldn't have introduced him to you. Because even before he came into your life, I have already loved you. It's just that, you paid attention to Winston than me. I was hurt, but I endured it all. I agreed to be your bridge, your messenger. To be there when he couldn't. I only did it because I didn't want to lose you. Then I learned you went with Cris. You didn't look at my way again. I got hurt even more. You didn't bother to listen and pushed me away to go with a married man. I kept asking myself why I was hurting myself even more. Why am I allowing Eva to keep doing this to me? Why do I still love Eva even if she keeps hurting me over and over again? Eva, please notice me. Listen to me. For once, why don't you look my way? Don't make me cry, Dom. I'd feel bad. I don't want to take advantage of someone like you. You didn't do anything bad to me. I don't think any good bachelor would still want to be with me. I'm here, Eva. I'm willing to marry you, Eva. The show is about to start. Let's go. [upbeat music playing] Ladies and gentlemen, we present with great pride, our star of the show, Miss Eva Baron! [crowd applauding] [upbeat music playing] Dom! [horn honking] [horn honking] [tire screeching] [horn honking] [tire screeching] - Dom. - Eva. What else do you want me to do for you to believe me? [horn honking] [horn honking] I believe you now.
