[indistinct voices] Athreya! Athreya! [indistinct voices] Athreya! Athreya! [door knocking] Athreya... Call for you. -Hello!-Hello. Uncle... Hey Seenu! How are you? You need to come home. You can catch a Bhopal-Tirupati tourist bus in four hours. You can get down at Nellore. Stay strong! Careful buddy. What happened uncle? [vehicles honking] What are you saying uncle? [cicadas critter] [door creaking] [electricity trips] This is the most important scene in this movie... You see that guy sitting in the chair? He is Kaiser Sose! He's the guy who runs the whole show. Oh shit! Really? Yeah... I reacted just like you when I saw this for the first time. But when I watched it for a second time, I figured out he was the villain in the opening act itself! Huh? [tongue clacking] Look at him, sitting there like he's innocent. The next time you're at a crime scene, the guy who comes across as innocent, is your prime suspect! -Hmmm... -Look at the guy...! He's using details available in the room creating a story to fool the cops! Stop stop stop! Which building did he come to? 344... Which one was he supposed to come to? 314! How does he know? That's when you know, that DiCaprio is the cop! [gasps] Oh shit! Really? Yes! You don't need to overreact every time! -Once was enough. -Hmm. Even the best plans have minor flaws. -That's how we catch them. -Hmm. Play it. [television playing] DiCaprio! [indistinct voices from television] Do you like DiCaprio? A lot, sir! Is it? Do you want to marry him? If there is a possibility, yes! Come on! Come on! Come on! No! I wantedly asked this trick question to you. Detectives do not have a personal life! When you're discussing about crimes, all your focus should be on crimes! -Ok? -Hmm. Sorry, sir! Now tell me! Do you like DiCaprio? DiCaprio? Who's that? Good! Ouch! Tom hanks is here? Yes! Did he meet DiCaprio? Yes! Did he go to the hotel? Yes! Did he give his wallet? Yes! What do you think is in the wallet? [gasps] -Just empty papers! -Oh! Even a genius detective like Tom Hanks was fooled! Watch. [groans] [phone ringing continously] Agent Athreya! Sirish! Tell me! Ok, ok! All right! [gleefully] Yes, yes, yes! What happened, sir? Any good news? Someone passed away near Nellore Gandhi statue! [gasps] [celebrating] I mean... We have a case! They're not sure if its suicide or murder. Oh... Let's go! Yeah! So you see... That's the detective way! That's exactly how we should execute! Ok? Never be boring or routine! We need to stay unique! No matter what we do, it should have a unique style. [giggles] What do we do when it falls down like this? Turn around. Make sure no one is looking at you, before you pop it back on! -Oh... Ok! -Let's go! The thing about crimes... Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Sir, I'm going to switch off the lights & fans... No! You need to rush out immediately after receiving calls like this! That TV needs to stay on! The fan turn too! Lights need to stay on, Shutter needs to stay open! Most important thing, when you go to a crime scene, you need to have a coffee mug in hand! Slurp it like this... [slurping] ...and walk with an urgency! Try it. "Don't act smart" "He is a master in Nellore" "You are confused by his dress, aren't you?" "He is a master if he starts working" "Hey! Listen to this if you are a criminal!" "Oh moron! Run away" Hey! [shouts] [indistinct voices] [vehicles honking] Damn! Spoiled my new coat! Rascal! All these fellows love me. This guy seems to be new, ignore him! [indistinct voices] What else? Why are you suddenly interested in being a detective? Sir, it's not sudden... English non detail text books in school, got us all to study 'Hound of Bhaskar Villa'. -That... -My God! It's not Bhaskar or Sudhakar! Basker... it's the hound of Baskerville! That's our car! Go and open the door immediately! Hey, tomato guy! Stop bugging me man. I have my own problems! [gasps] Ouch! [groans] -I asked you to open the other door! -Sorry, sir! Hey, what's up! [groans] [crowd murmuring] [clears throat] I meant this door! Sorry, sir! Sit! Sir, where is the driver? Did he step out for a tea? Why aren't you saying anything? Who will drive the car now if there is no driver? [crowd murmuring] [vehicles honking] -Shall we go, sir? -Let's go. -Sneha... -Sir. This is your prescription for 10 days! Watch 'Shawshank Redemption' film on an empty stomach tomorrow! Watch 'Silence of the Lambs' after the breakfast! This is a half hour before lunch, L.A. Confidential. This is after dinner, Shutter Island. Follow this for the next 10 days! From the next month, when you watch thriller or suspense movies, you should be able to tell who's the murderer in the first ten minutes! That's your work assignment! Hmm! Good. Ok, sir! Meanwhile, where are we going? Who died? Ssh! [gasps] Never discuss crimes in the car! All that after we get out! Huh? Only casual talk is allowed in the car now. The moment we get out, only crime related talks are allowed. It's all casual now! [Fake laugh] Just like this. So what else? By look around... Had your breakfast? Yes, sir. Steamcakes & Lentil Dumplings. I love lentil dumplings! I can go to any lengths for it if I like the taste! There's a guy near Murlikrishna hotel near Gandhi statue, who puts up a lentil dumpling cart! He makes such amazing dumplings! My god! Anyway, -I'm familliar with that place, sir. -Really? My friends and I used to hangout there everyday! He's comes at 4 sharp every day! I made sure to have the first dumpling he makes every day! I have a funny anecdote. All of us bunked class and went there one day. My uncle came there at the same time. Sir, what happened after that? Did your uncle catch you? The girl's name is Sanjana! Apparently, she committed suicide last night. Huh? I told you, casual discussions are only for the car. The moment we leave the car, our case should be the only focus! Let's go. -Stop! Where are you going? -FBI! FBI! FBI? [door creaking] This was a planned murder! How are you so sure? Look at the suicide note on the table. It's tilted towards the left. All her books and notes are tilted to the right. Her pen is lying to the left side of the notebook, the table lamp is at the right side, all her eatables, cold drink, phone and chocolate are on the left side. She's left handed! Then why is the gun in her right hand? Why would someone so dominantly left handed, shoot with her right hand just before the moment of her death? -Point number 2. -Hmm. Let's say, she did use her right hand, shouldn't she let go of the gun when she fell? Even if the gun simply stayed in her hands due to shock, her finger would have been on the trigger but, it shouldn't look as if it was staged. Point number 3. Cigarette smokers have a habit. They always smoke the whole cigarette before throwing it out. Especially depressed people. Why did this girl shoot herself halfway through a cigarette? Let's say that she shot herself halfway through. Shouldn't the cigarette have completely burn out by now? It just didn't. She's still holding it tightly. Someone else smoked that cigarette and put it between her fingers after death. The funny part is, She's not a smoker. This is the only cigarette in this house. None of the other rooms in the house had any cigarette. There weren't even cigarette stubs in dustbin. There is no ashtray and stinky cigarette smell! Every room except this one is clean. Point number 4. Anti depression pills on the table. These pills expired an year ago. Why did this middle class girl not choose the fan to die? Why would she need a licensed gun to suicide? This gun, anti-depression pills, cigarette this untidy room and that suicide note, all these were staged to make us believe that she killed herself. This is not a suicide. It's a cold blooded murder! You're a genius sir! [indistinct voices] Sir! Namaste! Who are you people? Sir, you must be thinking that this is a suicide, it's a murder! Come on I'll show you! Hey! Who told you this was a suicide? Even we know that this was a murder. Upon interrogation, her friend confessed that he did it for money! You had to interrogate him. I just looked around and found out. What was that back there? You think you are here for a shop opening? Why did you entered by cutting the ribbon? What's the hat and that coat? Why are you dressed up like an undertaker? What's with the interrogations? Who the hell are you? FBI! FBI! FBI? Isn't that in America? They copied from us! FATIMA BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION! Fatima was my first lover name. I named it after her. Saying "Fatima Bureau of investigation" was getting too long! So I changed it to FBI! Very famous! Two years later, go to U.S and ask for FBI, they'll ask "Isn't that the one in Nellore?" We also offer discounts to the police! Sir, keep this somewhere... Important... Come here, sir. We solved the case together, right? Let's take a selfie! [phone keypad beeps] Yeah! Nice! 'Murder solved' 'Feeling excited with...' Sir, are you on Facebook? [camera clicks] I'll tag you. [camera clicks] [vehicle engine revving] [slaps] [laughs] Get up. What do you want? -Coffee... -There's no coffee in the cup man... [laughs] Who is this guy? [birds chirping] [vehicles honking] Did he hit you too hard? My uncle caught me at the dumpling cart that evening. Oh, ok...! So your uncle caught you? What happened next sir? What else? He tied me up to a tree and hit me with his belt! So he also beat you? "He is a laughing stock in Nellore" Watch where you are going! Hey! You can't touch me man! "Don't laugh" [indistinct television playing] Look at there... Even a genius detective like Tom hanks was fooled! This is a part of the detective job! Some times we get cheated and beaten by others! -I can understand that, sir! -What? I understood, sir! What's that? I'm still learning, sir! Don't act smart! Do what's in your job description first! What's with your clothes? And those spectacles! Get rid of the specs from tomorrow! Didn't I tell you about the detective's attire that hat, coat, and a band-aid though there isn't any wound? -Do you even have a Facebook account? -Yes. Do one thing! Login to your account, search for our page 'FBI Nellore' and like it. -Sir? -Hmm. This has only two likes. Mm-hm... -One is you... -Hmm. And the other one is... Sherlock Holmes! Yes! It's me! I created a fake Sherlock Holmes page and liked our page! He is like our deity! -A like from him will help us get respect! -Oh! -Do you have a passport size photo? -Yes, sir. Bring it tomorrow! I'll get your FBI ID card ready! You can join work from tomorrow! Okay, sir! Let's go. -Sir... Sir... -Hmm. -I have a doubt! -What's that? Can we get a tube light here? It will be a little brighter! No. This dim lighting suits our line of work! Not only work but workplace ambiance is also very important! Oh... You're amazing sir! One more thing! What is it, sir? Don't keep calling me, sir! Then what do I call you, sir? [shutter bangs] AGENT SAI SRINIVASA ATHREYA [humming] [shutter bangs] This is my shutter! This is my home... my gift! [beatboxing] Agent! -Yes. -I got lentil dumplings for you! Put them there. I'll eat while I'm working! [Drily] That's likely! By the way, what's our program today, Agent? -Program? -Hmm. Ours is a startup, Sneha. We won't get major cases everyday! We didn't get any case even yesterday. We went and investigated anyway! -What? -Nothing. We'll get a major case soon. Until then let's solve some small cases and make a load of money. Small cases as in? [indistinct voices] Here comes one. Watch! -Give me those lentil dumplings! -I'll break your bones! Come on! -Hello, sir! -Hello Mr. Athreya. How are you? I'm good, sir. You tell me, what's the matter? Take your seat. There was a robbery in a nearby temple yesterday at 7 pm. The priest says he saw these two skulking around. Both of them are pushing the blame onto each other. You need to find out who the culprit is... That will be easy, don't worry! Which one of you did it boys? Sir, its not me but it's him. Sir, I didn't do anything but he did it. Really? -Don't open it! -Hmm. Do one thing! Choose one of these fingers! One is a thief's finger and the other is a good guy's finger! Whoever chooses the bad finger, is the culprit! What a naughty thief you are...! Why did you do it? -Sir, it's not me. -Sir, he is your thief. No, I'm not! He's fidgety because he is guilty! Just by a happy fluke, he might have gotten the good finger... There was a 50% chance in this! So, he decided to take a shot. That guy is innocent as he has no clue what to choose! Hey! Enough said! I went to the temple to pray, but now because I touched your finger, you're calling me a thief! What if I catch your feet? Will I become a god now? Is all this some bloody joke to you? Huh? Hmmm. You are right man! I get the feeling that you're telling the truth! Moreover, you look like an innocent guy! I think I saw you near Leelamahal Theater last night... Were you there? -Yes, sir! -You went to watch a movie? -Yes, sir! -Balcony seat? Yes, sir! You parked your bike downstairs in the lot? -Yes, sir! That's what I'm saying! -That's why I told you, this guy is the thief! [gasps] Sir! Leelamahal theatre has been closed for repairs for a week! What the hell were you doing there, man? Sir... That is... Were you watching the movie on some worker's phone there? "Yes sir!" It seems! Dirty rogue robbing temples... Take him away sir! He is your thief! You can go! -Sir... Sir... Please listen to me! -Come you bloody thieving rogue! Sir! The case is solved, let's click a selfie. Okay! You too! [laughs] Why are you laughing? Please act like a thief! [camera clicks] Right, sir! -Right. -Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Athreya! Come. Sir, what about my payment? How much? Give me Rs. 1116 since it's a temple case. He has stolen Rs. 500. [sighs] Keep this Rs. 116 for now. Let's settle some other time Move! Move! Bring me some major cases, sir! I'm done with the small stuff! You'll be the first to hear when I find something! Move! Move! Remember the slip I gave you just then? Open it! [gasps] How? He said it himself! No matter how fearlessly you commit crimes, there is always a fear of getting caught! It is visible in their eyes! Most people cannot hide it! Just like this guy! -Even criminals? -Hmm. Do you think these criminals are really that intelligent? 90% of them are morons! All you need to do is to read their thought process! Their way of doing the crimes, Their fears... If you get a grip on them, You can solve any case! [vehicles honking] [indistinct people talking] -Agent! -Hey! Sirish! Sir! How are you man? Super! We've been talking on phone but it's been a long time since we actually met! What can I say! Crime reporting has become a hectic job! The stories take up most of my time! Ocassionally when I do have time, You remember my mentor in Kavali NGO? -I go out and meet him! -Oh! His place is shut today. So I came to hang out with you before I head there! Sir, it's our luck! -Shall we go for a coffee? -Let's go! Brother! Pour my coffee in this! So, what's new man? As you know, life is very busy! -Any interesting cases? -Nothing man. Just barely hanging on! Hey Sirish! It's been a while, where are you man? I was very busy man! What are you doing here? I came to meet a friend! Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya! Namaste, sir! Agent? LIC Agent? Sir, I heard there's a new policy that came out recently... You think I should take it? [sniggering] He's not a LIC Agent! He's a detective agent! [laughs] Detective? [indistinct people shouting] Detective! As in? -Actually.... -I'll explain. What else, sir? How's your house construction going on in the street behind? What construction? Oh, come on, sir... You park your green vespa AP 26 3473 here every morning! You buy a newspaper here and get on the 10.30 bus at the bus stop to go to office! You'd reach your office coolly at 11, must be a government office then! There's only one government office on your bus route! PWD! Pen & calculator in your pocket, You must be the PWD account supervisor! You're maintaining two phones on your Rs. 15000 government salary! One is an iPhone you've hidden away in the back pocket! You must be doing a lot of under-the-table signings! You leave those files pending and then return back here in the same bus and get down here at 6 sharp! You disappear somewhere between 6 pm to 8 pm! You're shoes are heavily soiled when you're back at the shop at 8 pm. You order a ginger tea & Red Wills cigarette and you make a phone call to your wife from here! "Darling! I'm stuck at the office" "I'll be back in an hour." Why is it, sir? Why doesn't madam know about the construction site? Without informing about the second house and the second phone, you pick up a bunch of Jasmine flowers, get on your Vespa from the parking and return home like a loving husband! Am I right, sir? How do you know all this? You drink tea here everyday don't you? Brother, do you know who this man is? -No. -Why? -Because... -Because he's a teastall owner! Well! You buy a newspaper here everyday. Grandpa, do you know this man? No! -Because -Because he's a newspaper seller! Then how do I know all this, sir? Because you're a detective! Sir, now do you understand? What a detective does... I fully do, sir! Go on then... It's 10.30... Time for your bus! [vehicles honking] [bus arriving] [tyres screeching] Sir! The kumkum and sacred ash marks on your forehead, rings on your hands... You seem to be a god fearing person! You're stamping on those 'evil-eye' pumpkins everyday, be careful! Convey my greetings to the madam. Bye, sir! Right! Did you have to rag that poor fellow so much? Actually, I'm here for your help! About? Un-identified dead bodies! Just in Nellore district alone, five dead bodies are surfacing every day! No one knows who it is. No one knows why they died. It is not even clear if it is a murder or a suicide. An estimated 100 bodies surface everyday in our country! Is there no police investigation about these bodies? Actual complaints have no hope of being solved sometimes! These bodies don't even match any missing complaints! Nobody cares! There is an unclaimed dead bodies section. They hold the body there for a week! If someone comes to claim them, well & good! Otherwise, they obtain an autopsy report from a government hospital, they're sending these bodies on for mass cremations! Hmm! Hey! I always wanted to chase this case down but, I'm not able to find the time for it! Are you interested? Tell me if any dead bodies show up again! You know just how much I like these weird cases! Huh! Just one call! -Sure, man! -Sister! How are you? I'm good Seenu! So? What else man? What's new? Is everything okay? [phone ringing] Hello! [indistinct people chattering] We'll be there in 15 minutes! Yeah... Thanks! -Hey I need to leave man! -What happened? Some murder case. We'll catch up soon. [indistinct people shouting] Listen! The fan is running! TV is on! Atleast, close the shutter before you go! [gun shots] There's a basket on my main gate everyday! A milk packet goes missing from it everyday! We don't handle cases like this!

[electricity trips] Uncle! Where's mother? [sobbing] I've already completed the cremation customs by afternoon, Seenu! Today is panchak kaal! Conducting cremation activities during panchak kaal, is said to be very bad for the village and the family! That's why I had to complete it in a hurry! How could you cremate her without me? You were supposed to wait until I arrived! It's not that Seenu, you are aware of our village customs & traditions. That's why, I had to do it! Your bloody customs... I couldn't see my mother! [music muted voice] How did it happen? Last week, she went to the aadi festival held on every year. You know the tradition there... Devotees get hit on the head with coconuts! She was fine even then... She suddenly fainted one day... Doctors informed us that the nerves in her head damaged a lot and she slipped into coma. Just two hours after being in the coma... Your mother... [sobbing] Why did you let her go? Damn! Mother... Mother's gone... [music muted voice] Mother... [gasps] [phone vibrating continously] Yes, Sirish! Hey! They found a dead body near Venkatachalam railway bridge, -on the outskirts of Nellore. -Is it? Hurry up! -I will. Thanks man!-Ok, man! [phone beeps] [dialer tone ringing] [birds chirping] [train honking] What are you doing here? Who are you? [train moving] -Did you do this murder? Huh? -Why would I kill? Someone... Called me... So I... Are you trying to dispose the body here? Sir! I'm a detective! Arrest him! -Move! -Remove your hand. Sir, Please tell him. Arresting a famous detective is not easy! You should know... No I don't! Take him away! Sir! Sir... You asked me to remind you about this file! What a style, sir! Awesome! That burger... Those chips...! Those crunchy chips sound like Rehman's music! Can you hear it? -What is this nonsense sir? -My God! Your height... Your uniform... My god! Amitabh Bachchan! Mr. Amit! -Please sir, I really am a big detective. -Send it to this address! Hey, Sirish Watson! I can't possibly tell you how disappointed I am upon your late arrival! Please do the needful to get me out of this godforsaken place, thank you so much! What a bloody brilliant day! Sir, I'm a... crime reporter from Eenadu! So? The guy you arrested, Athreya... He's my friend! This guy is a friend of our prisoner. Throw him inside too... [sniggering] Sir... He really is a famous detective! You've arrested him by mistake. Stop saying famous. No one knows him beyond his street. How is he famous? He went there on my information. You're a crime reporter you say... I'll tell you in words you will understand! Objects found at the crime scene, are called evidence! [typewriter keyboard clacking] People, like your friend, found at the crime scene, are called suspects! So, he is my suspect. No way am I letting him go! Get bail. That's the only way he's leaving. Today's a court holiday! I can't get bail until morning! Then he stays here tonight! Don't you worry... We'll take good care of him We'll feed him all he wants and then we'll beat him until he digests all that. I know how to bring him out... -Come Sneha! -Good. Get on with it then... ...stop wasting my time. Hey! Just one minute man! Ya, I'd like you to hurry up! The person you are calling... It's ok... It's just one day! Fine! Detectives getting arrested is a good omen! When they make my biopic, this jail scene will bring layers of emotion to the film! I'll try to get bail by 10 tomorrow! It's alright! All this is nothing. That one guy is snoring a lot. Don't worry! -You can bail me out royally tomorrow! -Excuse me! Your time's up. Leave! Biopic it seems! He'll probably play all the characters himself if someone makes his biopic. How many more lies will you tell? I've unnecessarily paid you a lot of money already! -What is wasted? -I'm trying man! You'll be bailed out in a week. Trust me! One more week? Fine then. What's the matter, brother? Nothing, sir. There was a theft in our village last month! Then the police arrested me. That's how I became a thief! But I didn't do this theft, sir! [phone ringing] I'm begging my lawyer to get me out on bail... He keeps giving all sorts of excuses, like there's not enough evidence or bail is impossible now... Do one thing. [phone ringing] Tell your lawyer to say you were out of town that day. How's that possible? Tell them you went to Chennai for a Sai Baba spiritual meeting! Get a lodge bill to show you stayed there, a food bill from a nearby restaurant, a couple of cinema tickets, and a couple of fake bus tickets to Chennai from a private travels. Get all these ready and create a story that you were in Chennai that day! Get him to create these proofs of your innocence! You're really great, sir! Thanks! One more thing, Ask your lawyer to quit books and watch movies! How are these people dealing cases without basic cinema knowledge? -Sir... Even I'm not able to make bail! -Don't call me by addressing 'sir'! Agent! Agent Sai Sreenivasa... Athreya! Come on! Brother, please don't fight. One by one! [indistinct voices] -Form a line! Form a line! -Hey! Wait. Him, you, him, him, you and him... I will bail out all of you tonight! Hmm. Tell me what you did! Sir, I... [music muted voice] [music muted voice] Sir...! -Hmm. -What is this food? Order a full meals from Venkataramana hotel! Shut up and eat what's given! Go, get in! [metal door creaking] Hello, sir... Welcome! You too join us! Oh my dear man! What's happened, sir? You're awfully quiet since I've been here! You didn't even eat anything. What's it sir? What is your problem? Let it be anything, I'll solve it like that! Do you want bail? Huh? Sir! [snapping fingers] I'm talking to you. Alright, your wish! Divya... Who's Divya, sir? Divya is my daughter. What happened to your daughter? She used to sponsor books for poor children. She used to teach such kids and also did many more charitable activities. She went to Ongole on the 18th of this month on some work. That night... She called me at 10 in the night and said, "Father..." "I'm scared" "Those three will not leave me..." And her phone got disconnected. After that, I couldn't reach her no matter how many times I tried. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know whom to turn to. Immediately, I took my friend to the Ongole station and lodged a complaint there. The inspector over there said, "There's an unidentified body here" "Go identify whether or not it's your daughter" [crying] My Divya... It was my Divya! The inspector said that she committed suicide because of love failure. But that wasn't it, Anyone who saw my daughter's body could clearly see it that she was brutally raped and murdered! [weeping] That inspector refused to listen to me. The doctors made a report citing it to be a suicide by hanging. I don't know whom to talk to or where to go. [weeping] Calm down, sir. Do you suspect anyone? I mean, Did your daughter say anything? That day, right next to my daughter's body, we found her cellphone. I told you that she called me at 10 that night, right? We checked her entire phone call list. The same day from 9 pm onwards, right up to 9.55 pm, there were 3 to 4 calls from those three numbers. I became suspicious. I went to Ongole station and handed over the evidence to the SI. He said they would verify those numbers, they asked me to come back later. When I went back again, they feigned ignorance about the phone, and said they don't know who I was and pushed me out. I came back home to our police. Some guy defrauded people in a chit fund scam at Venkatachalam, and they claimed it was me and jailed me here. [weeps] You said your daughter got phone calls from three numbers. Do you know who they were? Any details? I don't know the names, but I had written down the numbers thinking that it might be useful. Can I see them? Yes... Here. Is that your daughter's picture? Yes. I'll try to find out more about these three numbers. [sobs] Please don't cry sir... Please don't cry! When you lose someone you really love, You hope to have had one last chance to see them. But, after seeing my daughter's lifeless body, I prayed to God why I saw her like that. [indistinct siren wailing] [taps] Hey you! You got bail. Get up! What with you, Agent? You're out of jail. Why are you still gloomy? I met an old man in the lockup, Sneha. Someone brutally raped and killed his daughter. He tried complaining to the police, instead of helping they filed fake cases on him, seized his belongings and threw him in the lockup! He had been crying, thinking about her all night... When he was explaining about the way he found her deadbody, it gave me chills! Imagine a father, he finds out that his daughter is dead, he finds her body in such a condition, Think about the pain he must be going through. [claps] I keep telling you all the time, that we'd get a big case soon. Hmm... This is the one! Let's take this up! Maruti Rao gave me three numbers. I doubt that these three guys are using their influence to bury the case details. The police are also protecting them and covering the case. Find out the details of these three guys. Okay, agent. They said I will be shifted to a sub jail tomorrow. I will come meet you in two days. My name is Maruti Rao. What's your name? Agent Sai... Call me 'Babu'. Agent. What happened? She said she will send it in an email, Agent. [machine whirrs] The first number belongs to some guy named Ajay. Brindavan Apartments, behind railway station, Nellore. Who's the second? [machine whirrs] Next print. Harsha? Who's he? RK Puram, Nellore. The third one. [machine whirrs] Vasudha? A girl? Is there no photo? Uhuh! The photo of the third number is not in the database. Interesting! Interesting! Okay. Let's check on these addresses first. Are they still there? Were they in Ongole on the 18th... We need to find out. [knocks] Hello madam! Our bathrooms are already clean. -No... I'm not here for that! -Is it? Even our clothes are shining white and bright! No... Not for that either! By chance you're from the salted toothpaste gang? No madam, I'm from One Flight couriers! Oh! There's a courier for Ajay sir! I was about to say that, but you didn't let me! [laughing] Hmm... Actually it had come on the 18th. I couldn't reach him on the phone that day. 18th he was out of town. Yes... He did mention that he was going somewhere... To Ongole! Yes! Ongole. He said he was going to Ongole! He asked me to deliver it today. Its ok, give it to me! Sorry madam, please don't mind, Company policy! I can only deliver this to Ajay sir. can you call him once? He isn't home. He's at the office. He'll be back in the evening. No worries madam. I'll come back again in the evening. Ok. Thank you madam. Have a good day! What happened Agent? This is Ajay's house. Ajay was in Ongole on the 18th What do we do now? First get rid of this cap. She thought I was there to clean her toilet... ...Like Abbas in that Harpic AD. Damn! Remove Ajay's address from the package and put Harsha's address on it. Actually it arrived on the 18th madam. 18th he was in Ongole. Maybe that's why he didn't take your call. Haa ok, ok. Sir, did mention it. Later when I called him, he asked me to come today madam. He just went out. He'll be back soon. Ok... I have a few more deliveries to give out. Is it ok, if I come back in the evening at 4 o'clock or 4:30 maybe? Ok. Thank you madam, have a good day! [laughing] Even this guy was in Ongole on 18th! Sneha, something happened in Ongole that day! Hello madam. I have a courier for Vasudha. Who's Vasudha? She had given this address for delivery. There is no one here with that name! No one? -Are you new here? -Yes. Do you know about the previous residents? No! Can you give me the owner's number? Why? It's an important courier madam. -9, 0, 3, 0... -Hmm... 6, 9, 3, 1, 4, 9. [chuckles] [door creaks] Many Thanks... I mean... thanks. -Make a call to the owner now. -Ok. Phone: The number you have dialed is not reachable. It says not reachable Agent! -Try Vasudha's number. -Hmm... Ok. Phone: The number you have dialed is not reachable. [sighs] -Ok, keep calling to the owner's number. -Ok. Ajay and Harsha both were in Ongole on 18th. So, something happened there. And Vasudha must have some information about this. So, let's follow Ajay and Harsha separately from tomorrow. Mmmm... This Harsha looks very dangerous. So just to be on the safer side, you follow Harsha. I'll follow Ajay. As the cops are trying to cover up this case here, that means any steps Ajay and Harsha would take in the next two days will also be covered up. So our following should be very thorough! Who are Ajay and Harsha? What they are? And what they are doing? Every minute of the day, what are they doing... every person that they meet. Everything has to be noticed and tracked. -Ok? -Hmm... -Did you try Vasudha's number? -Not reachable. -Her owner? -Not reachable. Keep try calling them, it's very important to contact them! Be outside Harsha's house tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock! -But Agent... -Hmm? I don't have a bike. -Oh... -Hmm... Now I remember, Even Harsha's bike is in need of repairs. It's time to walk! Stop! Stop! There's a hospital opening. Please visit with your family! I'm an orphan. Cotton candy Abdul Razaaq Persian traveler met Sri Krishna Devarayalu. Wasn't Abdul Razaaq a Pakistani cricketer? When did he meet Krishna Devarayalu? Some nonsense they keep writing! -Sir, please give alms, I'm hungry! -Dumb book, do you want to buy? Hey! Hey! [phone rings] Sneha where are you? Outisde the house. Has Harsha come? Not yet. Not Yet? Agent? Shall I knock his door and ask him? I need to follow you. Why aren't you out yet? Don't overact. Do as described in your job discription first. -Are you coming early? -I'll call you back in a while. Ya, I'll be back in the evening. I need to go out. Don't forget. Come home soon. Didn't I say I'll come? Sir, can you give me two minutes of your time? We're having a fantastic offer sir, this offer won't be available from tomorrow... -No, no need! -...sir. Just a two minute demo sir and then I can explain all about this offer. I don't want it! Sir offers like this are rare to come by. Once you hear this offer, even you will ask about it again. It's a very fantastic offer sir, -Fine Go on! -give me 2 minutes of your time sir? Hello! -What's the offer? -Hey, get lost! Sir, thank you sir, offer has expired! [music mutes voices] [metal door creaks] What's this? Are you trying to rob the bank? Sir we are having a very fantastic offer on books sir.

[laughing] Haa agent. I'm at the outskirts of Nellore. Harsha is in the ice cream parlor. He is talking to some one here. He's talking to Ajay! Turn around! Agent... -They're leaving, let's follow them! -No, need. Hey! Sit, sit... Sit there and talk! This is how detectives should talk. We don't know each other. Venkatachalam Railway bridge! News paper office, car rental agency, Mortuary. Seeing all this, I feel that these guys have some connection to the railway bridge murder. They're trying to cover something up! That's why they're worried. 2 things, first we have to gather the details of the guy in Tirupati and gather information about Vasudha! 2nd point! Divya! They've told that she too went to Ongole on 18th. Why? Some NGO activity it seems, what is it? We need to find answers to all these questions. Come early tomorrow morning. -We have a lot do to. -Hmm... -Alright. -I'll take bill. Yeah! Separate though, not together. I don't know who she is... [laughs] Pay the bill and move. I'll meet you in the parking after 5 minutes. Agent! [phone rings] The house owner we tried calling yesterday. -I'm calling from the courier company sir.-Yes, please tell me. There is a courier addressed to Vasudha for your address. -Ok... -When I reached there... The tenants said they don't know anyone with that name. Vasudha? Yes sir. The current tenants have been shifted there 3 months back it seems. Was there someone with that name? A previous tenant! There used to be a couple before. The girl's name isn't Vasudha though! Ok. So that couple, do you know their whereabouts? I think they've gone to the US after vacating. I don't know anymore details Ok. Thank you sir! -Thank you sir!-Ok. Ok sir! We need to know who this girl is. Vasudha might know what happened in Ongole that day! Who killed Divya? [sighs] Divya? Divya! Agent! Divya? Oh my god! You're Divya right? Who are you? Who is Divya? No... Not that! You're... Do you know Telugu? What are you talking? Is your father around? Your father Maruthi Rao, is in jail! -He thinks you are dead. -Dad! -My daughter is calling. I'll make a move. -Ok. -Who is this? Do you know them? -Uh! Uh! Your father? He is my father! What are you saying? Sir... This girl... Can you understand what I'm saying? Rape attempt... Hey, you! -What is this rape attempt nonsense? -Sorry. Are you crazy? Sorry sir! Get lost man! Sorry sir.... You come dear... The bus is ready now! What happened Agent? Sneha she's the girl in the photo! She's Divya. She's the one in the photo Maruti Rao gave me! He thinks she's dead, she's alive! Are you sure? Come. [cicadas chirping] Suri, sir has sent them. Take care. Mmm... Sir! Greetings sir! I... Need to meet Maruti Rao... Visiting hours are over. Please come tomorrow. Sir! Sir! Please help me out sir it's urgent... Please sir. Fine... What's his name? Maruti Rao, sir! There's no one here with that name. Maruti Rao, he's an old man. He was supposed to be transferred here from the rural police station. Please check one more time. No prisoner was brought here from rural in the last 3 days. No one has come? That's what I said. I'm getting death threats, why aren't you taking action? -Stop whining man! -Hey! Where are you going? -I need to meet the Inspector. -He's busy. Sit down. -Sir it's a little urgent. -Sit down man. We're getting death threats from an unknown number... Hey, Detective, sit down man! No clue sir! I don't even know who they are sir. Come back in the morning. Sir, please tell him. Hey, wait! Go man! -Didn't he ask you to come tomorrow? -Send the detective! -Come dear. -Go! Thank you! Mmm... What is it? Mr. World Famous Detective, did you brought the burger? I will, if you give me a small information sir. You have arrested a person name Maruti Rao that day right? Didn't you transfer him to the sub jail? Maruti rao? Who's that? Maruti Rao sir... That old man in white clothes, he was in the lockup with me that day... Maruti Rao, ah? Wasn't that guy's name Gopalam? He was making a drunken scene nearby, so we locked him up for the night. -And freed him in the morning. -Who is Gopalam? His name is Maruti- You arrested him for being drunk? Tell him... Brother, -Do you have that man's address? -That is... -Brother! -Home minister sir is asking... Come on, tell him. This is our only job, to enquire about everyone's address. Get out! Go! Hello... Do you think the police are hiding something wantedly? [cicadas chirping] I spoke to Maruti Rao that day. I could see the pain in his eyes Sneha. How about we... go inquire in the Ongole police station once? He did say he registered a case in Ongole right. Let's go to Ongole, come on. Agent! I should go to home for once. Mom has been calling continuously. Ok. You go home. I'll go get the car. Tell your mom we are going to Ongole on work. What's the delay? I went to buy medicines for mom. I'll be out in 2 minutes, Agent. [cicadas chirping] -Umm... Agent! -Yes? I need leave for one week! Why? Karni Mata festival is happening in Bikaner, Rajasthan. So what? Goddess Durga takes the form of rats in the town it seems. My mom believes, spotting a white rat among those rats brings you good luck. So, we us to go every year, but we couldn't go last year. Mom thinks that's why her health is affected... Sneha, how can you believe all this hocus pocus garbage? You're educated, you need to tell your mother. How can you ask for a leave in your first month? My shift is 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock, Agent! I am working overtime now right, I'll take a compensation leave for this... Oh wow! By the way Agent, will anyone in the Ongole station co-operate with us? Ongole SI is Sirish's friend. Oh... The it's fine. If there is a case in that station, we will know who's lying. Namaste sir. Namaste... We're here from Nellore. My friend Sirish must have called you already. What do you need? Has there been any case filed on 18th about the death of a girl named Divya? I need those details please. We did find a dead body. But it's a male dead body! Male dead body? We haven't been able to identify it. 18th night, did we find any dead body of a girl named Divya? -Just check once. -Male dead body? Call me if you get any information. Thank you. Sorry Athreya! There has been no complaint registered in any station on Divya's name! Something is wrong Agent! I really don't understand what's happening. The total case is going clueless. The old man said he filed a case here. These guys are saying, there's no such case. Who's lying? Something's happening... We're reading this case all wrong. There has been no registered case, Maruti Rao is not in the cell. What happened to him? What happened in Ongole on 18th? One clue... Just one clue! [yawns] TV: the Government is imposing strict rules, TV: 300 tractors have been seized on the same day by Excise dept. TV: The CM threatened strict action if these activities aren't stopped soon. TV: Police have arrested 720 people in connection with this case! [TV report continues] -Agent. -Hmm? -2 minutes, I'll be back. -Hmm... TV: Lakhs of people have come to the service of Garuda which took place today TV: and took part in the procession. The TTD has taken high security measures to prevent any discomfort to the pilgrims. TV: Nellore bank employee brutally murdered. TV: Dead body found on the outskirts of the city! TV: Getting into the details, TV: A Nellore resident and a bank employee named Ajay, TV: was the victim of a brutal murder. TV: His mangled remains were found at the edge of the city! TV: The police have collected important clues TV: and can confidently reveal the facts behind this gruesome act pretty soon, TV: The district SP assured that the culprit will be arrested within 24 hours! [TV report continues] Mr. Srinivas Athreya? Yes? You're under arrest. Why? For the murder of a bank employee named Ajay. [meditating] Keep your attention on your breath! -Now with the little finger... -This isn't a little finger, -It's the index finger! -This is my little finger. Close your nostrils and do what I say. With this little finger, close your nostrils, exercise your lungs.... Inhale... Hey, Athreya... -Athreya! -Exhale... Will this help us get released from jail? I don't know about that, but stress will definitely leave your body. What are you doing? I'm breathing the pure jail breeze man. Hey, when cops questioned you how it would be if you stay silent? What do you want me to say? Tell them you did nothing. Hey, when I was asking them, you know what they're saying? They are saying that you didn't even try to defend yourself man. That day in the hospital, in the ATM CCTV cameras, outside the car rental agency. There are video proofs everywhere that I was stalking Ajay. Ajay's watchman and his laundryman will definitely remember me. The day Ajay died, I had been following him everywhere. There are multiple video recordings of everything. And you want me to go to the cops and say, 'sir I'm innocent' 'Who is Ajay?' 'What is Ajay? Is this you want me to say? They will start hitting me for that. That's why I stayed silent. I'm probably just the prime suspect in Ajay's murder preliminary investigation. [sighs] I do understand, but who killed Ajay man? Ajay and Harsha together did... Harsha! Where is Harsha? I don't know Agent! Didn't Harsha talk anything after Ajay's dead? No! Call Harsha immediately. He isn't picking up. That's it! Ajay and Harsha had a tiff outside the coffee shop right? -Yes. -Later Ajay gets murdered. And now we don't know about Harsha. You both need to go and trace Harsha's whereabouts. He could be potential suspect in Ajay's murder! -Quick! -Ok man. -Ok done. -Ok Agent! [door knocks] [door creaks] Is Harsha at home? When will they give the body? Police verification is underway, maybe a couple more hours. Ok. Ajay and Harsha were brutally murdered. We had to identify the bodies by their belongings. A few body parts... are still missing. They found the murder weapon and... Your fingerprints are all over it! My fingerprints? Not only that, they even found drugs at Ajay and Harsha's houses. Same sample, 100g cocaine was found in your house too. What? Because of this the case against you has got more stronger. They're calling this a drug mafia clash. Cops are saying you killed them because of that. This is going to be the headline news paper and in every channel tomorrow. Are you happy now? -I told you long back. -One second... One second! Maruti Rao entered my cell on the day I got arrested. I started investigating this case after I heard about his daughter right? I thought I was helping the old man, I hoped this case would bring great fame to our agency. That after so long, I finally caught a big case. We didn't catch this case man. The case came and caught us, Sirish! Think about it! What was I doing? I thought I was following Ajay and Harsha for my investigation. No! There was never any investigation. I've been manipulated into planting evidence against myself. That day, a knife had fallen down on the road. I picked it up. There! That's where they found my fingerprints. What's the murder weapon? It was a billhook... (a coconut knife) That's it! Ajay and Harsha's deaths were already fixed. They needed me as a patsy to take the blame. That's how they created a fake case to pull me in. That old man's name was Gopalam, not Maruti Rao. Everything Gopalam told me was a well planned bullshit story. Athreya listen to me. All this looks very dangerous. I'll bring you out anyway I can. You're no Sherlock Holmes, just let this go now! Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character. Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya is original. They trapped me right? Nice! They have planned it very well. Now this case got very interesting. I'm not going to leave until I get to know who and what they are. What should we do now? Three things. First, let's trace back to everywhere and everyone, Ajay and Harsha have visited... Only then can we understand what these two were up to. Second, Gopalam gave me three numbers Ajay, Harsha and Vasudha. Two of them are already dead. Vasudha, she is either dead or they are trying to kill her. We need to find her quickly. Third, can you get me out of prison? Case against you is very strong. -Apply for bail man. -I'm trying man. Ok. I'll go now. Hey, Sirish! What time was Ajay killed? 9 P. M. I was in the sub-jail at 9 P. M. Really? I had gone to inquire about Gopalam. How can I kill Ajay? Go to the sub jail, get the CCTV footage from them. Apply for bail using that, I wasn't at the crime scene during time of death. Super man! I'm going to bring it! -Ok? Bye man. -Ok. The jail footage isn't clear, you've only been granted 5 days interim bail. Mean while you've to submit proofs that you are innocence. You just have 5 days with you. You need to give your signature at the police station everyday. [birds chirping] Fine, thanks man. -Aren't you coming with us? -No, man. I'm going to the NGO in Kavali. There are many works left over there. -Ok, let's catch up later. -Hmm... I'll call you. Alright man. -Thanks man. -Bye. -Agent! -Hmm? You told some Sherlock Holmes dialogue yesterday. You told it well. A little funny, but feeling is good. [chuckles] Alright, what's our brilliant plan agent? Listen carefully. Nellore MLA's son is getting married today. We need to go there, [Singing Jigelu Rani song from the film Rangasthalam] -Agent! -Our plan is to dance. Plan it seems... Two murder cases are on my head, let's go solve them first. They've started. IMRAN CARS -Excuse me! -Yes? Can I know why was this man here? Who are you? We're from the special investigation department. So what? -Sneha... -Agent? We still haven't found that child kidnapper right? No. Not yet Agent. I found him. Who is it Agent? Abdul, owner of Imran Cars. They say a man with a french beard is snatching little children. He's our regular customer sir. He booked a car to Venkatachalam 3 days ago. He came again yesterday because he some personal things in the car. That's all sir! He came to collect his personal things? Yes sir, he picked up his things yesterday. He's been asking for news articles on unidentified bodies in the last 4 days. -Unidentified bodies? -Yes sir! They found some dead body near the Venkatachalam railway bridge. He kept badgering me for that post postmortem report. This is a government hospital sir, no one cares enough for a post postmortem on unidentified bodies... They keep sending random write-ups. One says heart attack, another says kidney failure. To each their own... Just finish the job and go. Not only that, look at this signature, Satish it seems... There's no Satish working in this hospital. He used to ask reports like these sir. If these ever got out, I'll be behind bars. But he'd never listen sir... I will not tell anyone. I knew Harsha for a long time. Criminology student. He and Ajay were working on some unidentified bodies case... I called them when I saw one such body under Venkatachalam bridge. That day, in his hurry. Harsha dropped his bike keys. He had come here again searching for them. Sneha careful, there's a constable around. I will guide you over the phone. [cicadas chirping] Who are you? We're here for the investigation. Someone was just here... This is a second level investigation. Do you suspect anybody? I don't have any suspicions. Please go! Did Ajay give you any documents before he died? Nothing! Can you please try and remember? There's nothing to remember... I said there was nothing. How many people do I have to talk to? It's not like that... Sneha, just do as I say... Go to the door Stop! Turn around now! Look at her and repeat after me. Madam... Madam... Your husband was brutally killed. Your husband was brutally murdered. The only ones who are trying... To find the real culprits. If you don't help us, Why they killed Ajay? Who is the real culprit? Will remain a secret forever. Ajay's death will become meaningless. It's still your wish. One minute. [fingers snapping] Yes! What did she give you? Sneha, these are photos of unidentified dead bodies... They went to Ongole on the 18th for these photos... Agent... Someone is in the house... [cicadas chirping] Constable is sleeping.... [vehicle honks] He's up.. He's up... Turn around, don't look at him... Hmm... -What else? -Uh! Uh! -Talk something very casually... -Hmm... Casual... -Did you feed the cat? -Hmm... -Does your cat drink Buffalo milk? -Hmm... What do you call your cat? I call him Agent! Is he gone? He's gone! Let's go... Let's go... Let's go! [metal door creaks] [door creaks] [wardrobe door creaks] [wardrobe door creaks] Agent! What happened? Agent... The same cover. This was the same cover someone gave to Harsha in the supermarket. Why is there my name on it? This has all my details. Come on, let's go! I forgot my mobile there! Hey, Sneha! -Sneha, constable will return. -2 minutes Agent. Come fast! [muffled screaming] [gasps] Agent! [coughing] Agent! Let's go! What are you worried about? Someone tried to kill me... It means our investigation is on the right track! Don't worry! I'll be fine! He's here! [vehicle arriving] Namaste sir! Thanks for seeing us immediately upon my phone call. That's okay, Athreya! I heard you guys talking yesterday. Discussing about that in the station is not a good idea. That's why I asked you to meet outside! Can you tell me everything that happened from the start? Sneha! Can you identify the man who gave the cover? If I see him, I will definitely identify! I couldn't see his bike number as I was in a hurry. But, I remember that the starting number was 7! 7? It means we have thousands of vehicles to search! It's not going to be easy. Anyway, let's try getting a list of vehicles starting with 7 from the RTO. Okay. Thank you sir! It's getting late, you need to sign at the station. Let's go. I'll come tomorrow, sir. Agent! The vehicle I saw that day is outside! It's not the same vehicle, but a similar one. Similar to this one. Are you sure? Damn sure, sir! These are old police vehicles, Sneha. Blue Colts used to have them. Now, constables use them. I remember those blue and red stripes very well! Okay. Come with me. -Sagar. -Sir. Get a list of all police vehicles starting with number 7. Quick. Sir, here's the list. Sneha, what do you think his age would be? Somewhere between 35 to 40. Get a separate list of people in 35 to 40 age range. Photos? -Is it him? -No. Next. -Is it him? -No. Next. That's him, sir. He gave that cover to Harsha. I've seen this guy somewhere. Sneha, are you sure? Damn sure, sir! Suresh Sir Call Narayana and ask him to come to the station immediately. -Go. -Okay, sir. Why it took so late, Narayana? I was coming from the neighbouring village. Come, Narayana. Sir. Did you meet Harsha a couple of days ago? Yes, sir. Why? Sir, the thing is that... The thing is that... Why! [taps hardly] Sir... Tell me... Sir, the thing is that... Harsha had seen this man near the Venkatachalam bridge dead body. He requested me to secretly give him Athreya's details which were in my station I just gave him those. That's all, sir. Is that it? Yes, sir! There is nothing more other than this. Okay. Go. I think he is telling the truth, Athreya. Ajay and Harsha saw me near that dead body. It means they knew that I was investigating those bodies, sir. Why didn't they report it to the police? Why did they secretly obtain my information? Harsha wanted to meet me about this case, sir. He must have some information about the dead body. They were killed before they could meet me, sir. That's why they tried to kill me too. Sir, They could have framed anyone in Nellore for the murders of Ajay and Harsha. Why me? Beause the common point between Ajay, Harsha and I is the dead body. This whole drama started with that dead body. I have a small request. Can you use your influence and force a proper postmortem on that body? If we can find out the cause of death, we will get to know the link between the murders of Ajay and Harsha. Thank you, sir. No problem. -I'll meet you tomorrow. -Okay. Thank you, sir. They asked me to file a complain in this station, sir. That area doesn't fall under our jurisdiction. What is this sir? You people are making me run around from station to station. My daughter and I've been getting death threats from a week and we are trying to file a complaint but none of you are paying any heed. Why are you shouting in the station, huh? What is this, sir? Don't you get my words? What is the point of wearing these uniforms? My daughter is missing. -What's happening here? -Are you guys happy? What is this nuisance? -Who is this man? -If something happens to my daughter... ...I won't spare anyone of you. Sir, he says that his daughter is missing. He is shouting at us despite telling him that it's not in our jurisdiction. My daughter is missing, sir. If something happens to her... My daughter is missing, sir. If something happens to her... [weeps] -Listen to me, sir! -I cannot take it sir! Please stop worrying and answer my questions calmly. Come, sit down. [weeps] Give me your daughter's details. She looks fair and stands five feet six inches tall, sir. When she left the house, she was wearing a red coloured dress. Oh... Any identification marks? She has a tattoo of her mother's face on her hand which she got in her childhood. She went to the medical shop at night two days ago. She hasn't come back yet. I've called everyone I know. No one knows where she is. What's your daughter's name? Vasudha. [gasps] Vasudha? Yes, sir. Sir... When did you last speak to your daughter? Right before she left for the medical shop that night. She's missing since then. Did you try her cellphone? It's switched off. -Suresh. -Yes, sir. Is there any report about finding a female dead body? Yes, sir. A dead body was found near the Kavali bridge an hour ago. -Our policemen went there. -Okay. -Sir... -Yes, sir. You too come with us. [indistinct train honking] [wind soughs] [indistinct train honking] Morning, sir. What happened? It is a woman's dead body. The dead body is in an unidentifiable condition. She was brutally murdered. There were scratches on her entire face. The dead body started to decompose and it is stinking too. What is the colour of her dress? A red dress, sir. Come with me, sir. Please have a look at the body. [sobs] They've killed you Vasu... Vasudha! Sir, don't touch the body! -What are you good for? -Sir, her belongings. What are your uniforms good for? No... Just stay away! We found this near the body! Shucks! [exhales] -[indistinct voice in the walkie-talkie] -Sir. What are you doing here? Who allowed you here? Why are you looking up? Searching for the Arundhathi star? Show it to the girl too. Hey detective, he is talking to you. I'm asking you. Why do I always find you near a dead body? What can I do, sir? You aren't doing your job properly. Mind your words! If you had done your job, that girl would have been alive! -Why are you shouting? -Then? -Do you know who did this murder? -Who? Is it? In a way how you have murdered Harsha and Ajay, this murder took place in the similar pattern. -You killed them! -We understood that you can't solve crimes Next time, give me a call. I'll come and solve it for you. -Agent -What does he think of himself? -Let's go agent -What the hell are you talking? -What will you do? -I will tell you. There's no need to fear. We've done nothing wrong! -Let's go, agent. -There's no need. Come on... Tell me. This murder was also committed by this detective. See that his bail gets cancelled. Agent... Let's go agent? So you'll just go around arresting everyone in the crime scene? -Why are you shouting? -Do something, sir. -Athreya! -As the dead body is in the crime scene, -Cancel the bail of the dead body too.-I'll smash your teeth! Athreya, go from here. Calls himself an inspector but can't solve a crime. -Leave! -Call me next time. Go and sell burgers in a bakery! Hey, Vamsi! Is this your doing? Is it you who brought him here? Sorry, sir. Hey! Clear the scene. Suresh, make it quick. -No.. Don't touch anything! Don't! -Clear out everything! I'm not leaving. Don't touch her. [vehicle doors thud] [siren wailing] [vehicle leaving] [wind soughs] Go! Didn't he tell you to come tomorrow? [vehicle arrives] What is this, Athreya? After applying for a bail in the court, there is a high chance that it gets canceled. Why did you have to piss him off unnecessarily? We couldn't save Vasudha, sir. So? Sir... Can you find out about the autopsy report of the railway bridge body? [dials] Hello... Aditya. Hey Vamsi.. I was going to call about that dead body. Okay. It is neither a murder mor suicide It was a natural death because of liver failure. Natural death? Is there any chance to find out the details of the body? I've sent the fingerprints and hair samples to our database. -If we're lucky we might find a match. -No... No... No! Okay, Aditya. Thank you. How can this be a natural death? Three people have been killed over this. They've killed Ajay, Harsha and Vasudha. There is something huge is happening, how can it be a natural death? Let's go to Aditya and have a look at those reports. [vehicle starts] Shall I? Kick! Who are you? Why are you following me? What? Is it you who tied us or vice versa? If you know who I'm, you will untie me and salute. Uh-uh? Is that so? I have have track record of casually ending the careers of gangsters like you. I'm asking you one last time, who are you? [gun cocking] My name is Bala Venkata Subhramanya Swami. Since that is a mouthful, I've shortened it to Bobby. I'm from Hasan, Karnataka! Coming to the point, I've been following you since two days. Why are you following me? What do you mean? I'm a great detective in my town. That's what detectives do, isn't it? Moreover, I run the FBI agency too. What is the full form of FBI? Err... Friends Bureau Of Investigation! My friends contributed when I was starting up. So I named it after them. [smiles] Why are you laughing? You can check FBI Hasan page on Facebook. Sherlock Holmes has already liked my page. I thought he was alone. Seems like there is one moron in every state. And then? One day when I was visiting my native I came across a dead body. Nobody came forward to claim it. Eventually, cops cremated it as an unidentified body. That's when I received information that you have killed him. I've been trying to solve that case since then. That's why I'm following you. Did you get a call? Yes. Did they say it was me? Clear as day. And that's why you're following me? Of course. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it! My dear Bala Venkata Subramanya Swami! We've both been manipulated in the same way. They went the extra mile with you. You still don't get it, sir? They manipulated me into stalking Ajay and Harsha. Same... They painted me as a murderer and got this fellow to follow me. They killed those two guys and framed me. Now that I'm out on bail, they have planned to kill me and frame him. What a game, sir! We've been playing with a lot of involvement like a bunch of bozos! Do you take drugs, bro? No. Just drinks and smoke. Then start now. They're going to find drugs at your home soon. They're covering up their perfect crime and we are their patsy. We've been following each other like morons and been dancing to Ringa Ringa Roses! We've played very well! Very well played. God bless you! All this is a game? Haven't you killed anyone? What kind of a detective are you? Still don't get it? Just untie him... Please... Shucks! Why do they call is as game? Then who told me about the railway track dead body? It's all too confusing! What did you say? Detective! Not that. After that? -I'm going home... -What was that at the end? Body next to the railway track.... [snapping] Sir, the body of Venkatachalam area's case was found next to the railway track. The body of Kavali area was also next to a railway bridge. Even this guy saw the body near a railway track. So? So... Hey, Sirish. Tell me Do you have a location wise list of all the unclaimed bodies that were found since last one year? I do have the list but I'm a little busy now. Hey, it is urgent. Can you send it to me immediately? I'm not at the office right now. Then send it with someone. Please! Okay. I'll ask a colleague to send it to you through email. -Okay? -Okay. Hurry up! Okay, bye. Athreya I've got news that they have applied for the cancellation of your bail. The hearing is at 11 am tomorrow. You might have to surrender in the afternoon. Agent, we got the email of list of unidentified dead bodies from Sirish. 52 unidentified bodies were found in our state in the last six months. 24 of those bodies, were found near railway tracks and bridges. Kakinada Tada All the bodies were found between these two stations. A few in Ongole, a few in Nellore, all of them were found near the railway tracks. These aren't unrelated cases like we thought, sir. They're all connected. Connected? Yes! How? These bodies are being dumped from the trains in this route. From the trains? Sir, we found a body near Venkatachalam. How did he die? Natural death. Exactly! Then, how did his body get to the track? Secondly, There is no approach road for a few places where these bodies have been found. How else are we finding these bodies near places without an approach road? The strongest possibility is that, the bodies are being dumped from the trains on this route. Won't a dead body catch attention on a train? What if the train... ...is a goods train? Agent, why can't it be a passenger train? Just imagine, A passenger train with so many people around. It's impossible to pull this off. "Sir.. Can I have the side berth? I need to throw my dead bodies out" Imagine having to say this. So it has to be a goods train. Even on a goods train, they can't do this openly! They should be doing it at night. Hmm... It's impossible in daytime. Even if it is at night, it has to be done when everyone is sleeping. It has to be after 10 pm or before 5 am. -Bobby... -Agent Find out if there's any goods train moving after 10 pm on the Kakinada-Tada route. Okay. -Sneha -Agent! Get that map. Look, sir. This is Kakinada. And this is Tada. The bodies found in the last 6 months... These bodies seem to be coming from Tamil Nadu, sir. How can you say that? Look... This is Tada. It's lies on the border of Andhra Pardesh and Tamil Nadu. So the first possibility is, this goods train begins in Tamil Nadu it enters Andhra Pradesh via Tada. As soon as they cross Tamil Nadu's border, they might be happily dumping these corpses everywhere in Andhra Pradesh. When the the state borders are crossed, the jurisdiction of police department changes. Even in the district level, the cops aren't able to spot the connection between the corpses. And when these bodies are from another state, there is no chance that they'd try to figure it out. In Tamil Nadu, In the stations after Tada, find out if there were any unidentified bodies recovered in the last 6 months. Sure. Sneha Agent What are the stations after Tada? After Tada, It's Aarambhaakam and Gummidipoondi. After that, it is Chennai outskirts. Agent Yes, what happened? There's a weekly goods train from Chennai to Delhi. Yes! Somewhere near Aarambhaakam, somewhere between 10 pm and 10.30 pm, This train stops at a red signal to make way for a super fast express trains Yes! Yes! Athreya Tell me, sir. There's no record of unidentified bodies between Tada and Chennai. Yes! So this train, stops for 30 minutes at Aarambhaakam. That's where these bodies are being loaded onto the trains. They start dumping them randomly soon as they cross Tamil Nadu's border. Agent, how can you be sure it is happening at that station? The stations before Aarambhaakam are Chennai and Chennai outskirts. These activities cannot happen at a major station like Chennai. They need a small station. That is Aarambhaakam. Why would they just dump these bodies with so much effort? To get to the bottom of this, We need to go to Aarambhaakam. Vamsi sir told that he would bring his car behind the market. [gunshots] Ah! Agent! [indistinct dogs barking] Agent! [pants] -Agent! -Agent! -Agent! -Agent! -[breathing heavily] -Sister, call the chief doctor urgently. [breathes heavily] Hi. Dummy gun doctor! Just makes sound and smoke. What about the blood? A little bit of Bru coffee powder and a little bit of vermilion... Mix them in water nicely and we will get nice amount of homemade blood. I swear! They're tracking everything I do. If they realise we're going to Aarambhaakam, they'll attack me again. If we need to reach Aarambhaakam secretly, Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya has to get admitted in the hospital for about 4 hours in critical condition. [wink mouth click] [whistles] What a perfect shoot bro! Come on... Lay down. You know what to do, right? -[breathes heavily] -Aah! Perfect! Some more! -[breathes heavily] -More... -[breathes heavily] -Peaks! Give him a blanket. They might have come here too. Can you please help me out, madam? Step out into the corridor for every 5 minutes, "Doctor... Doctor! Patient is Critical! Athreya!" "Athreya's BP is fluctuating!" Just keep making up something like this... Show me a sample once. Doctor! Patient is critical doctor! BP is going down doctor! Come fast doctor! Please doctor! You are a great actress... [beatboxing] Great... Let's go now! It's mine. You guys go on, I'll change up... Boss, someone shot Athreya! He's in the ICU. Keep an eye on him and give me updates. What happened, Bobby? What's the band-aid for? [speaks in Kannada] Oh sorry, I got excited and spoke in Kannada. I'd understand this dialogue even if you spoke in Chinese or Japanese. How? We've seen this same scene in Telugu several times. Hey... Same pinch! It is said that, everybody has 7 doppelgangers in this world. Two of them are roaming in front of me now. [smiles] [phone ringing] Lets go sir! Tell me Aditya The finger prints of the dead body found at Venkatachalam, matched with a murder case suspect in Gujarat. -What? -What? I'll send the details in a few hours. Okay. Murder case in Gujarat? What is happening, sir? [indistinct train honking] [indistinct railway announcement] Hello, sir. I'm the Nellore Sub Inspector! I need some information. How can I help you? Once a week, a goods train passes through your station at around 10 pm. It reaches Delhi. Yes. When it halts here, is there any chance of illegal activities... -I mean anyone... -Who would come here, sir? I've been working in this station for a long time... The goods train stops for 30 minutes. I've never noticed any illegal activities in that time... Gopalam! What are these photos, sir? This was taken at a railway event 5 years ago. These guys are famous actors in the nearby village theater groups. They performed a play for us. Drama company? Yes, sir. Where is this drama company? They're closed now. Where were they based before? I don't know, sir. Do you know, sir? I know... it's about 30km away from here. Athreya is not in the hospital. Kill Gopalam before he gets there. Okay. I'll take care. Who's the fool bringing me liquor? I asked for whiskey Why did you bring beer? This is cheating. I'm going to complain. Police! Police! Police! Who the hell are you? You called the police, didn't you? Eh? [splashes] Where are we, sir? Who are you? Give me a small peg of booze, I'll tell you everything. Enough? Or do you want a large? Until 3 years ago, we were absolutely jobless, just aimlessly roaming around in the village. I got a phone call one day. [phone rings] They offered a job. They promised to pay. Hello? Where do I need to come? Okay. I'll be there. Coming... I'm coming. [tyres screech] We were asked to take those bodies to the state border and cremate them in the forests discretely. [fire crackling] It started with 3 to 4 bodies a month, and grew up to 7-8 bodies a month. We got paid 5000 per body. We were so happy. One day, as we were going about the usual forest cremations, the Forest Police spotted us. [siren wailing]Somehow we got away. The guys who hired us found out about it. Don't worry. Stay out of sight for a couple of weeks! For someone like us who lived off minor thefts, Losing all the money from this job, Losing this easy money opportunity... Worried us a lot! Later, exactly after 2 weeks... We got a phone call [phone rings] This time they decided not to burn the bodies. We took them to another guy with a van instead. The bodies were kept in those vans for about 7 to 8 hours. And then given back to us. Store those bodies for the entire week in the places we showed you. Dump them all together at once. Then we made the bodies completely unidentifiable even if they were found and carried them over to Aarambhaakam. Delhi goods train stops at Aarambhaakam for about 30 minutes. We brought the dead bodies there, loaded them on to the train and dumped them each at a different place after crossing the border. What is this? Why are they doing this? Where do these bodies come from? We never understood all that. We never questioned it either. [woman weeping] But... One day... we finally understood what's happening. You will handle the cremation, won't you? Would you scatter their ashes in the holy Ganges? Scattering the ashes of a dead person in the holy Ganges will bring peace to the soul. This is a common Hindu belief. If the cremation happens on the banks of the Ganges at Kasi, the soul will reach heaven and there will be no rebirth. This is another belief. People who strongly believed in this, but couldn't afford going to the holy Ganges to cremate. The innocent public who had no idea how to get to Kasi were targeted. Convincing them that the cremation would be taken care of money was collected from them only to dupe them and dump the bodies at random places is what we understood was happening. Just to keep their trust going... We pretended to perform some pujas before taking the dead bodies. We tied a small locket having Goddess Durga imprint to the dead bodies. People's faith in us grew. Word of these activities spread to neighboring villages and states. The number of bodies we needed to dispose grew. Cremation has to be done within 2 to 3 days. Otherwise, it is believed that the soul roams this world forever without peace. We convince people saying that it takes 3 days to take the dead bodies to Kasi and take the dead bodies as early as possible. For 3 years, The whole process has been running smoothly. Last month, I suddenly fell sick. I was admitted in a hospital for 2 weeks. The dead bodies we had were decaying in our godown for 10 days. I got a phone call and I was told we couldn't wait anymore. Ad I couldn't go, I have sent someone else in my place. But I don't know what happened on that day. I don't know what happened to the guy I've sent. And then, I got a phone saying that we needed to stop this for a few days. Not just that... They sent me those 3 numbers, showed me the photo of an untraceable girl and asked me to cook up a story and narrate to you. I swear! It's the truth! Who's the guy calling you? I really don't know that. Why are the bodies being shifted into the vans? I don't know, sir. So you don't know who they are? I always got calls from some landline number. Who they are, What they do... How many of them there are... I know none of these things... Also, I don't even know what they do to the dead bodies in their vehicles. I swear! Let's go. -Hello. Okay. Take a right from there... -You go on... I'll catch up! Come straight from there and take the first left, Adjacent to that is a godown [siren wailing] We're right here You're taking away so many bodies without the funeral. Don't the relatives or neighbours ask any questions about the dead body? Those who ask are told a story, that the bodies need to be cremated soon or the soul will be cursed... Or sometimes we say, "Burning the body during Panchak Kaal," "is bad for the village and the family," "that's why" "the body was cremated immediately..." Another story we tell is that, "Cremating in the early hours would send the body straight to heaven..." "There will not be anymore rebirth cycle" "That's why the program had to be done before everyone came" These are a few cover stories we prepared for them. [phone ringing] Uncle. Tell me, Seenu. Why did you cremate mom before I reached? I did tell you about the Panchak Kaal, didn't I? Uncle! Tell the truth, Uncle. They said cremating her near the Ganga was a great blessing... [disconnects call] When I was in school, When I wrote to my mom saying I was afraid to be alone without her. She would come to my hostel within 2 days. The only memories worth remembering in my life were with my mother. I lost my father in my very childhood. She was my everything. Then one day they told me she had passed away. I went home and she's not there. I couldn't understand a thing. I couldn't see her for one last time. Knowing that I wasn't next to my mother when she needed me... keeps eating away at me everyday. After all that she had done for me, I couldn't at least be there and cremate her properly. That pain is haunting me. For a very long time, I was convinced that she's still alive I couldn't see her one last time. When someone dies, we cremate them. That is the respect we show them, for the life they have lived. I couldn't even do that much for my mother! They're dumped from trains? They're dumped like trash? My mother... Not just me, A lot of people like me are not able to see their mother, father, sister, brother for one last time all because of some rogue's ridiculous business. When Gopalam doesn't know who his boss is how are we going to find out? Give me that. Sir, can you please call your friend once? Hello Hello Aditya, Athreya wants to speak to you -Sir -Yes, Athreya When did the Gujarat murder happen? One minute. 5 days ago. When might be the time of death for the dead body that was found in Venkatachalam? 10 days. Thank you, sir. How did someone who died 10 days ago, kill someone 5 days ago? You can always be caught when you remove any organ form a human body, sir. There is one thing in our body that can be stolen without getting caught. Our fingerprints. They need these dead bodies to collect the fingerprints off them. What will they do with these fingerprints? You can plant these finger prints at any crime scene in the country. You can completely deviate a criminal investigation. You can create a 'fake fingerprint' database and sell it to criminal gangs. This is exactly the way it happened in the Venkatachalam case. They must have planted these prints at some crime scene in Gujarat. The local police might be investigating the case considering him as a suspect. They may never find out whom the finger prints belong to. Even if they do find out, this man is already dead! So they will conclude that, the murderer is already dead and close the case right away. This is a mastermind plan to perfectly deviate a crime. Not just a crime deviation, Fake finger prints can be used to create new voters and rig elections. Terrorists who switch their identities with fake passports and Visas can carry out their plans in any country without getting caught. These fake finger prints are a necessity for all of them. If all they wanted was finger prints, couldn't they just take them off any dead body? Retrieving finger prints off a dead body is not easy, Bobby. When we die, our body loses Oxygen and blood supply extracting fingerprints after that is very challenging. Like Gopalam said, that's why they have been shifting the bodies into a mobile van. They probably have some sort of a lab setup in the mobile van. They must be chemically extracting these fingerprints. It'll take at least 6 to 7 hours to do this. That's why they planned whole charade. The bodies are stored in a warehouse after extraction. Later they were simply dumped off from the trains. Why? Because the railway department cremates unidentified bodies within 3 to 4 days. They are fully aware of this loophole. That single loophole is the capital for this business. Gopalam said that they wanted to stop operations a while ago. For them to stop a foolproof systematically run business suddenly, can mean only one thing. They feared they were going to be exposed! This fear means that they did a mistake somewhere. -Sneha. -Agent. Where are Ajay's Ongole photos and unidentified bodies file? At the office. Sir, Bobby and I will go study those photos again. Okay. A small request, Can you ask Narayana to bring us the belongings of the dead body found at Venkatachalam? Sure. We're missing a clue there. We might know it if we study it again. Sir, one more thing. Can you both visit Ajay and Harsha's college? College? -Yes. -Why? Any background information we have on them is important for us. Okay. Sir, these are the belongings of the dead body that was found at Venkatachalam. This issue... No problem [shutter opens] Hand me the constable's cover. We need to meet the principal. Last room on the ground floor, sir. Hmm... Okay. Hey, aren't you done yet? -Almost done sir! [phone ringing] -How much longer? 2 minutes, sir. Sir, Athreya's bail has been cancelled. We have the orders to arrest him. -Narayana. -Sir. -Let's move. -Okay, sir. This is the dead body's photo that was clicked by Ajay and Harsha in Ongole. This was tied to the Venkatachalam body's hand. Why do they have the same talisman? This is the talisman of Goddess Bethaballi. There is a district called Vellore in Tamil Nadu. She's a popular deity there. Goddess' talisman? Remember what Gopalam said? Sometimes they pretend to do pujas and tie talismans on the bodies which is then removed before dumping the body. Gopalam didn't go that day. So, the new guy who went in his place knows nothing about these talismans. That's why these two bodies still have the talisman on them. These guys must have come searching for these talismans. The bodies are dumped at random location. By the time they found the exact locations, these bodies were seen by Ajay & Harsha in Ongole, and I saw it in Venkatachalam. That's where they might have seen us. What is the problem if the talismans are found? We need details of your old students Ajay and Harsha for an investigation. A girl who was their classmate is working here as a lecturer. She may be able to help you with anything you need. -Okay. -Raghu, take them. That is the route to Athreya's office. Why are they so worried about this? There must be a connection to them and this talisman. What is it? What's the connection? What is it? What is it? What do we know about them? They promise a funeral at Varanasi and cheat people by orchestrating a perfect religious crime. Such people shamelessly use God's name for everything. Sai baba industries, Balaji textiles and more such names. What if they have a business named after this Goddess? Maybe they're running an organization with this symbol. Do one thing, Any organization in this district with this deity's name or symbol, from small shops to large companies... anything Make a list of all of them... Quick! What do they have in common, ma'am? I mean... Friends or enemies? Any incident in the college in which they were both involved in? Nothing of that sort But they did do their final year project together. Oh! What's it about? Can I see that project? Religious crimes in India? Yeah! It's about how public are cheated by criminals in the name of religion. They have worked for almost six months on this material. Vasudha? Vasudha is their friend too. All three of them worked on this project. Sir, these three of them were friends. -All three of them know about this crime.-Madam. That's why these three were killed! Here are all the details about them. Ma'am, can we take these photos and project material with us? "Bethaballi Amman" That's the deity's name, isn't it? Bethaballi Amman milk diary, Bethaballi Amman Textiles, Bethaballi Amman NGO... [shutter opens] Did you find anything at the college? Yeah, agent! Ajay, Harsha and Vasudha were close friends and classmates. What? Their only common point is the project they did together. "Religious Crimes in India" These are their photos. They did a project on Religious crimes which means they might be knowing everything about these crimes. That's why they were killed. Business with corpses! They are highly intelligent, Agent. They are dead bodies anyway No complaints... No risk! What did you say? Yeah, Agent... all the relatives think that the body was cremated in Varanasi, who would lodge a complaint? [smiles] None of the railway track bodies had any missing complaints.... Right? Except for one. Whose? The dead body that was found at Kavali. Her father filed a missing complaint. Red dress... Mom's face tattooed onto the hand... Tell me one thing, sir. How does the tattoo from her childhood and the one on the dead body... go missing from her hand in this photo? That's because Vasudha is still alive! All these things are being done by the father and daughter duo! If Vasudha is alive... Why did they fake her death? They made me believe that some Divya was dead. They framed me in the murder case of Ajay and Harsha. If that plan had worked, I would've been locked up for 10 years. But there were two mistakes in their plan. One: I saw Divya. Two: As there was a sub jail CCTV footage of mine at the time of Ajay's death, I got the bail. It was just Ajay and Harsha earlier. But now there is Athreya too. If these three people ever meet, With the details which Athreya had collected, and with the photos that Ajay and Harsha have... The clue of the talisman would be easily known if they compare those details. If they start looking into the talismans... it will lead them straight to us! Where's Gopalam? Ask him to find an untraceable girl's photo. Name her Divya and tell the story that I prepared to Athreya. Along with Ajay and Harsha's number, give one of my old numbers that has no photo in the database. No photo? This photo of the third number is not in the database. Athreya will be busy investigating those three numbers. He will come searching for all three of us. He will anyway not know about me, So, he will carefully stalk Ajay and Harsha. Then, we will kill Ajay and Harsha. All the evidences will be made against Athreya. Ajay and Harsha will be dead. And Athreya will go to prison. Their plan failed and I came out on bail. If I investigate the murders of Ajay and Harsha and reach their college I would find that Vasudha was their classmate. Just to shift my attention away from Vasudha, they shifted to plan B Which was, To make everyone believe that Vasudha was dead. They came to the station, Her dad complained about some life threat to his daughter And then he files a missing complaint We were frantically running around trying to save Vasudha. So when her dad showed us a body, we naturally believed it was Vasudha. "3 criminology graduates, died while investigating a religious crime!" That was supposed to be headline to conclude this drama! How did Athreya even suspect Gopalam? We missed something. He can unravel our entire business in 2 days. I thought putting him in jail would suffice. But he managed to get the bail because of that sub jail footage. This time, kill him before he gets to the jail. There's another detective in Hasan, get him to follow Athreya. Just repeat what we did for Ajay and Harsha. Make sure they find drug packets with both of them. This should appear to be a drug mafia case. File a fake complaint saying that I have a life threat. After that, we have to fake my death. That's the reason I've gave my my phone number in the database with no photo. When Athreya learns about my death, he will assume that it is the work of the killers who killed Ajay and Harsha. Even if he does go to the college and find out about us, We won't have any risk. Those three are criminology graduates. They have a good knowledge about general crimes and religious crimes. Ajay and Harsha used it for good. But this girl used it for the wrong reasons. We got away this time. Can't take that risk again. Buried bodies might eventually turn up somewhere. So let's use this loophole in the railway department. The dead bodies they recover are kept for 72 hours. Since no one is coming to claim, they'll burn the bodies. People who cheat others have a simple technique, sir. They carry out random philanthropic gimmicks for society such as distributing free food, running hospitals, blood donation camps and all sorts of showy gimmicks! Because they need to win the people's trust. This religious crimes project has all the details. Even these guys are running a gimmick as a cover. That gimmick is called, "Bethaballi Amman NGO" [shutter opens] [vehicle approaches] Bobby... Go that side. [door slams open] Bobby Sneha Nothing Agent As we have caught Gopalam, she has cleaned up and got away in the meantime. We're late. She got away! Okay, let's go! Let's go to Rajasthan. Why Rajasthan? Don't you want to catch Vasudha? But what's in Rajasthan? Stop expecting me to explain everything. What's next? [door slams open] I'll tell you what's you should do next. Check the beer bottles outside. Someone didn't drink it all, there's still half left. Because they must have left in a hurry. The earth is wet, probably rained in the morning. The tried to burn all the evidence but the fire is still going So they must have lit up the fire after the rain stopped. They should have done it probably before one or two hours ago. Check these footprints, 3 sets of prints are leaving the NGO. But there aren't any car or tire marks anywhere. So they haven't left by road. They have only one option left to escape this place quickly. [indistinct train honking] That railway station! Everything here points to the fact that they were here until an hour ago. The only train that left from this station in the last hour, Train to Bikaner. Rajasthan. Didn't you book Rajasthan tickets for your mother last week? Yes, agent! We're taking the same train next week for the Karni Mata festival. Exactly! People believe that the Goddess appears as a white rat at this time There will be several people with such beliefs who will flock there now. For a fraud like Vasudha... they are the easy targets! The case is closed, right? Let's take a selfie! Come... Come... Come... What happened aunty? Smile! You keep your face in such a way as if someone died! But you're actually happy if someone dies, aren't you? Because you can happily steal and sell their fingerprints. Bloody rat brained ideas! Uncle! Come on in... Why so shy? Come join us! [mimics uncle] "Vasudha!" "They killed her!" "They killed my daughter" Bloody third rate acting! You're supposed to teach discipline to your daughter. Instead of that you bring her to Rajasthan for the rat business? I'll put rats in your pants! Both of you are bloody psycho fellows! Go. Go play with rats in jail. You'll find white coloured rats, black coloured rats and whatever colour you want. Aa.. Agent! Come... Come... Please come! Give me an "Arrested" face! Agent, put a black & white filter, then we'd all look the same. [camera clicks] Move Thank you No problem sir... -What else? -Sir? Ok agent...
