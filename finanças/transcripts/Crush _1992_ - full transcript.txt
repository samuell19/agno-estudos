Do you want my skin? Ugly house. Yeah, he's not bad. Hey, careful, Lane. Critic basher. Punched his front teeth out on the dance floor. You told me. God, you'd better give him a good review. Too late, I said he was guilty of neoparochialism. "Colin Iseman's confessional modus operandi--" Give me that. Tina, I'd forgotten how nosy you are. So what are you gonna ask him? We've agreed not to talk about his private life. But you will. I'm a very ethical person. God, everything is so empty. McCahon said it's a landscape of too few lovers. But you'll fix that, won't you, Lane? 78 kilometers, you should take the car this arvo. Have a look at some of those geysers. I'll only be a couple of hours. Doesn't give you much time to fuck him, Tina. It's not like Australia. There's no predators, and I bet there's spiders, no snakes. There's even this totally benign. I'm sorry. I've been very uneasy about it. It-- it's like what I said about Colin. Uh, there's this obsession to uncover the germ of evil, search for the snake. There's the New Zealand psyche, looking at the serpents. I guess we have a streak of perversity here. Shit. Can you turn that thing off? I thought you were a boy. Why would I be? - Is that thing yours? - No. Dad's out. Uh-huh. Are you that critic? I hope he pays you for all this. He thought you were coming yesterday. Was he very disappointed? A bit. I didn't mean what I said before. You're too gorgeous to be a boy. What did you do to your head? Oh, I think it was that sharp, little corner where the car radio sticks out, but I'm not sure. So what do you do around here for entertainment? They're not nearly as big as they used to be. This country is obsessed with size. Ooh. - Hey, careful. - Oh. They have to bury them above ground, see? Our Indians put them in trees. She never told me he had a daughter. - Who? - Christina. Aren't you Christina? No, did I say that? Yeah. Well, I lied. Christina is in the hospital. She must have been going really fast to roll it then. I guess. The families stay with the body for three days before they-- The less I know about a place, the more I like it. What? She's not going to die. Hi, I just came to see you. Have a seat. Are you packing? Washing, otherwise I end up looking like a bag woman. Why is it so dark in here? Because the manager likes to gawk at me. He'll be out there. Take a look. Go on. Well, what's he doing? Nothing. That's a boring answer. He's gardening. Has he got a hard-on? Come here. I'm sick of you in those jeans. What's wrong with jeans? They make you look non-commercial. Hold this. Did you go to the hospital? I spoke to a doctor. She's got one foot in the grave, the other one on a banana peel. We look marvelous. You can wear it tonight. Did she give you that? Do you like it? Yeah, I like it. But it's too old for you. I almost didn't recognize you. Don't be silly. What's she like? She's, um, I don't know. Here. Thanks. You'd better fix the shoulders. This moments that's passing is like the clinking crystal glasses. The sparkle shines in your eye, communication, Lorelie. I'm so glad. I'm so glad to be alive, to be alive. Angela, come here. That's Arthur. You're not mad at me, are you? I thought you'd gone. Hmm-mm, I want to be a bad, bad baby tonight. Hi. Oh, Arthur's had a bad day. He just got the chop suey from the Fourth Street. Seven fucking years. Angela, you know that, um, guitarist in there? His name is Horse. I'm gonna be his manager. Take a suck on that. I don't need drugs to have a good time. You're such a serious thing, aren't you? No, that's what I love about you. I've had it up to here with cy-- cynical people. Does she always do everything with you? Mostly, sit down. Hey, come on. Don't be a bully. No way, Jose. Oh, work me to death. Lane. Shh, just ignore him. Come on. He's getting in. No, he's not. Hi. Oh, Jesus, fuck, you-- aw, bitch. Wakey, wakey, Horse. You snooze, you lose. What the-- Where's your dad? He's in there. Pretend I'm a big horse. Shh, but I can't believe you stole his car. Yes. Do you think he wanted to have sex? - Of course. - Would you have? No. Do I want to wake up next to that in the morning? I feel like a freak sometimes. It's just sex. There's more important things. Scoot over. - Good morning. - Good morning. - You're Lane. - You're Colin. Do you mind if I join you? Uh, no, uh, be my guest. I'll, uh, I'll get you a cup. The tea is still hot. I won't ask what you did last night because I don't think I'd like the answer. No, she's a nice kid, Angela. I like her. She's also only 15. She seems to think she has some catching up to do. Yeah, well, I wouldn't know about that. I read your book. Oh. I liked it. I thought it was very raw and truthful and-- It's fiction. Have you been having a good time? Smashing. Of course not, you were lucky. I can't remember. Was she married? Only to her work, she didn't get on with men. Is she going to come out of it? No, I don't know, maybe. I haven't been to visit her yet actually. I was driving. I'm sorry. I've got to go to work. I'd off you a lift, but-- But you don't want to. That's OK. I have a car, but you should come by and visit me. I'm only here for a couple of days. And why would I want to do that? Blind impulse, I mean, isn't that what you're famous for? Used to be, excuse me. I'm a good hair cutter, if you need a pretext for coming. - Hi. - Hi. Why do you have to go now? I thought you wanted to see the falls. It wasn't your fault. You didn't do it on purpose. Do you believe that? Yeah, of course, I do. Colin-- Colin, hi. Hello again. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? No, uh, a barber nicked me once. I didn't realize an head could bleed so much. What do you think? It's a-- it's a bit longer here, isn't it? Leave it to me. Come back here. Segue, from the Latin, , to follow, uh-huh-huh, uninterrupted transition from one song or melody to another, used in both live and pre-recorded music. She's here. Who? Lane, I invited her. She's got her suitcase. She must want to stay here the night. Hi, I thought you were gonna be off. No, I left my goddamn keys in the car. Really? - Hello, how's it going? - Great. Here, I'll take it. Big one. What you been up to? You mean tonight? I had a couple of drinks, and then I got sidetracked. Not like last time, I hope. No. What time's your flight? Some ungodly hour, we need some music. What have you got? Jefferson Starship, Cream, the Soft Machine. - What about this? - OK. I'd kill for a cup of coffee. It's only Nescafe. - I'd kill for a Nescafe. - Wait there. What? No, I don't dance. Hey, uh, drinks. Stop it. Excuse me. I'm just going to attach this thing to your toe. Come here. Do you want some? For me? No, thank you. Sit down, please. Now I'll tell you what I think. You're sore at me 'cause your best friend turned out to be a father fucker. Hmm? You shouldn't give in so easy. So what are you thinking? You have to stick to your girlfriends. They last longer 'cause there's no sexual pressure. They are a lot more spiritual, I think. You make a statement like that, and then you tack, I think, on the end of it? That's weak. It's like the way all your sentences go up on the end, like everything is a goddamn question. We talk about the , the spirit which is the last thing to leave the body when the body shuts down. You have to learn to read the signs. She's like a still lake, all that life teeming underneath the surface. Hmm, we have a lot to learn from the. 1, 2, 3-- now, Christina, we're going to stand you up on your feet. Get her legs, Sally. Ready and up. She's awake. She's just slightly more aroused. That's all. I'll tell you what. You hold her head up. Do you think she can see me? Can you see Angela, Christina? Got some ice here. Can you feel that? Is that nice? What she needs now is more than just physical care. She needs spiritual sustenance. That's where the family comes in, the, oh, God, my shoe. Hi, Christina, I'll read you a poem. It's by O'Rourke. "Tears so deeply felt rise up. When a life has climbed so high, and from the clouds of its own pain falls back, we call that rain death." Christina? Can you hear me? "So the darkness wraps close around us who are poor, while even more precious to us who are rich is the strange kingdom of Earth." Come in, dear. Don't be shy. It's Harry's birthday. Who's there? Come here so I can look at you. I know you. What's your name? You're a friend of that American. What about her? It's history, sister. I don't ask someone's friends against them. Hey, Hunya, get our guest some cake. You're the prettiest thing I've seen all day. Oh, aside form you, that is, huh? Yeah. I wish I had a cock. Why? So I could do this to you. It's like I had a choice-- save my wife, or write a bestselling novel. I didn't do either. A sad story. You're beautiful. Leave it. I want to be inside you. You're so strong sometimes. What is about you, eh? Your mouth maybe, hmm? This is something, isn't it? It's just a little too close to nature for my liking. Hey, in the summer, I'll take you up to the Bay of Islands. There's a place up there I know you'll like. I might not be here. Uh-huh, sorry. I might not be here. I might go home. So what is this, some kind of extended stopover? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it, something like that. Could you tell me what you've got in mind? God, look at you. You're just so goddamn serious. Yes, I am. I want to know what's going on. - I know what you want. - Do you? Yeah. So why have you stayed? I've stayed. That's all it means. I've stayed. I mean, you know, what the fuck? Are you coming? Then what? He was getting really angry. I thought he was gonna whack her one, so I just picked up his shoes and started throwing them at him. I said, get out, Horse. Then what? And then he left. What's that? - A notebook. - What's it say? "Christina is--" read something else. "From a certain point onwards, there is no longer any turning back. That is the point that must be reached," Kafka. What are you doing? Nothing, the bag fell off the table. Were you reading this? - No. What's it doing open then? You were reading it. It's-- it's not even yours. - Was she reading it? - Yes. Don't lie when you can't do it convincingly. What are you doing with it anyway? What are you doing? Get away from me. Christina's gonna get you. You stupid cunt, give me that. Just give it to me, Angela. Just-- Hey, what the hell are you doing? For Christ's sake, Lane, what's the matter with you? Hey. Hey, are you all right? She fucks everything. What sort of friend leaves you lying on the side of the road, unconscious and bleeding to death? She's the most lying, selfish, hypocritical bitch I've ever met. Hi. I saw her once at the fridge. She was sticking her spoon into everything and licking it in between. She's not even a person. She's an animal. Yes? She's at school. No. Angela, where have you been? With Christina. What? You don't even know her. It's good for her to have visitors. You should have seen her two weeks ago. She nearly died. She recognizes my voice now. It's true. They have done tests. She can hear everything you say. Christina. Huh. Christina, just wait. No, look, you don't have to eat it. Christina. - That's stealing. - I'm not stealing. - No. I'm not-- Christina. It's mine now. - Hey, hey. - No. Oh, God, are you all right? Look, just leave it, all right? Just leave it. What's going on in here? What is she going over here? Christina Anderson is the author of "God's own Frontier." She has contributed to "Landfall" and to-- hey, wow, "Rolling Stone." That's crayfish. You know, you've got a PhD. I learned it in your notebook, the one Lane took from the car. Hello, Mrs. Shore. How are you today? Remember I told you about Lane? She was the one driving your car. Here, open up. Come on. Open your mouth. It's her fault this happened. Here, I'll show you. This is the person that did this to you. So how's your patient today? She's fine. Can you see? Very nice. Christina, put it down. Christina, come on. Here. Don't you like me? We like you when you behave yourself. - You're just saying that. - Come on, Christina. Don't get upset. What are you doing here? Hey, hey, come on now, shh. I want to go home. You're overtired. You try and get some sleep, OK? OK, sourpuss. What? See that knitting needle up there? I've got an itch I can't reach, and it's a agony, mate. Keep going. Oh, a bit lower, oh, oh, oh, ah, ooh, oh, oh, you're tickling me, harder. Don't stop. It's just getting good. - I brought you a coffee. - Thanks. It's her, isn't it? I was thinking maybe Christina could stay with us for a while when she gets out. It might not look like it, but I'm trying to get to the bottom of this shit pile You wouldn't have to do anything. She's very independent. Christ, Angela, she's becoming an obsession with you. You can talk. If she comes back, I'm leaving. You can choose between us. I'm not living with a bitch like-- Just shut up about her, OK? I think you'd better leave me alone, all right? Just get out. Dad, do-- Horse? Hey, sister, got any drugs on you? No. You've been crying. I had a fight with my father. Wait till you get a husband. He's never shouted at me like that. Close the tent so the one with the big hips doesn't see you in here. Sit down. I like talking to you. You've got smart eyes. Did you do this? Give us a kiss. - No. - Please? Turn the light off. They won't come in if it's dark. I have to go. No, you don't-- a minute, 30 seconds. I have to ring Dad. He'll be wondering-- Shh, five minutes. I'm falling off. I've got you. If you're lucky, you might find a bit of skin. No, that's plaster. What? I just don't-- Here. Ow, not too hard. Horse-- Don't stop, faster. OK, Christina, we'll get you up in bed. - Angela. - How are you? Here. - No. Goodness me, Wayne. What's going on here now? Let's just go back a bit. Come on, you. How do you expect to walk if you don't try? You got up to 20 kilos yesterday. Push. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't believe she's gotten the nerve to come here. What did she do? She's a maniac. Listen, if she comes back, pretend you can't talk, OK? She's hurt you enough. So, uh, I'll be back in a minute, all right? What have you been doing? I'm looking for a job. I found one, too, in a restaurant, but I don't think the customers liked me. I'm a little bit drunk, but I have something to say to you. I'm sorry about-- this is serious, Colin. You'd better take me home and put me out of my misery. All yours. It's pretty weird how she acts like nothing even happened, don't you think? Look at me, Christina. You're gonna love it out here. You'll feel like a different person. You don't want to watch this, do you? They wouldn't let me wa-- You'll be out of here soon. - Hi, Angela. - Hi. You're looking nice today, Christina. Are you gonna shake his hand? She's really blossomed. We'll have to get you on the payroll. I remember everything. It was Lane. What? She told them not to give-- Not to give you that job, how did you figure that one out? She say I talk too much. She said. She said I talk too much. She was driving the car. She must have been speeding. 120-- 20 K's at least. She drove me through the bin. Through the wind screen. With my head. And you hurt your head. She should be inca-- In car? Incarcerated. Incarcerated. Yeah. Angela? Angela, what's the weather like in there? America's got military muscle, but it's completely fractured socially. Well, he obviously hasn't been to the Super Bowl lately. Look, hopefully the powers will be the minorities. But not economically, what do you think, Angela? You're gonna sand a whole through that. America's history. Look, McDonald's is recycling paper, recycling beef. I wouldn't touch that chunk. Hey, that's odd. Shit. Christina. Come here. - I'll get her. - Got her? Yeah. Here, OK, that's all right. Angela-- Christina, I'm Colin. Excuse me. There's $15 owed. Who's she? Hi. Angela, hi. Careful, careful. Look, uh, here's $50. Take her back, OK? No, she only just got here. What's he saying? Does the hospital know-- Just for the weekend. Give us $7. I thought you were gonna wear black? Hello. My name is Christina, and I have head injuries. I was in a car accident in June and-- - July. - July. Christina, do you remember Lane? She remembers you. What do you think you're doing? She needs a break. You don't know what it's like in there. So you put her at risk just to make some fucking point to Lane? It's good for her to get out. Oh, grow up, Angela. Look at her. Oh, God, she's freezing. Oh, come on, Christina. We'll get your jacket on. We'll light the fire in a minute. What about that driver? I said there'd be some lifting, and. I want to go home. Do you want to sleep out here or in the bunk room with me? I want to go home. How's it going? Can she-- Move over. Angela's taking me to the country. I know. Christina can stand for 15 seconds now, can't you? 16. That's good. What's she on? Stubetal, it's an antiepileptic, and these are painkillers for her. Hope you brought enough for all of us. Who is it? It's only Lane. Excuse me. Where are you going? Hey, Christina, here, use this. So the guy starts listing his favorite authors-- Hemingway, Raymond Chandler, Doris Lessing, Colin Iseman, Flo Stocks. And I said, gee. That's-- that's great. Who's Flo Stock? It turns out to be his mother. Typical. That's when you know you're in good company. Everything all right at the table, sir? Yeah, fine, thanks. Uh, no, some of us know when we've had enough. Enough of what? Come here. Christina. Please? You have to look at people when you talk to them. She's not from around here. I'm not fucking around here. Huh-uh, forget it. Remember what the doctor said? Some of us are just getting started here, oh, unlike the vicar over there. I told you my new regime-- no alcohol, no stimulants. No surprises. That's right. When I finish my milk, they said I could put you-- I can't remember. No, they said I could push-- Print, publish? No, RUP said that-- Yes, it's very flattering, Christina. Come on. Come on, Tina. Spit it out. Lane, don't turn. Are you my friend? Sure, we go way back. Tina and I were on the same debating team in 1974. We used to smargen-- You never told me that. I-- I-- I'm sick in my mind. I'm mumbley, and I'm-- We've got to go, OK? - Like I used to. - Come on. We're going home. - Colin? - What? Move over. I just don't feel like sleeping with you. That's all. - Colin. - No. - I want to talk. - In the morning. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Hey, hey, it's OK. It's OK. I want to drive. OK, if you want. Don't follow me. Hang on. Let me do it. What is it with you? Angela. What are you doing? You shouldn't have left them. She's all right with Lane. God, you're a fast walker. Let's give them some time. What's that? It's a river. Where are you going? It doesn't mean anything. She was just testing me. That's all. It means she's getting better. She'll have to do a lot worse than that to get rid of me. You're really patient with her. Well, she hasn't got anyone else, has she? What did you think would happen with Lane? I don't know. I guess I wanted to see her face. I think it's time the two of you buried the hatchet. Get away. Will you just let me-- stop it, OK? Great, you can stand. Christina. Please. - I'm gonna go back. - Sure. No, I'll go. Here, we'll meet you at the ferry, OK? Yeah, OK. Hey, Angel. What? Give us a kiss. Oh, God, I thought-- oh. Forgive me, Christina. Oh, good. Easy. Lane! I'm walking. I saw.
