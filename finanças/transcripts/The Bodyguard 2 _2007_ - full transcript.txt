To be honest, I wouldn't sell this stuff... ...to anyone else. Oh, this is fun! Kids from across the river have asked me for this stuff... ...but I won't let them have it. I don't see anything. Pope! Turn it on for him! You know he's a freaking retard. Jesus! Sorry about that. I'll take care of it. Confused, aren't you? I told you so. - Can you use a gun? - When I lived upcountry... ...I used to shoot at birds every day. - Okay, come here. Keep your eye on that guy. That guy there. - When I give the signal, take him down. - Okay. - When I nod my head, you shoot him. - Got it. Give me the money. - I don't have it. - Then get it from the guy who does! Are you a complete imbecile? Is it a revolver? - No. Are you sure you can use this? - Of course. - Cock the gun, aim and fire. - Why cock it? So you can fire it. - Take off the safety. - What is the safety? - Are you sure you can do this? - Jesus! I told you I can shoot! - Okay? - Okay. Don't let anyone see you. Watch him. Who are you?

Where did they go? - That way. That's twice now. I'm not upset... Hurry! What kind of bird has a purple head? The Purple-headed Sparrow. I've never seen one before. It's just migrated to Thailand. It must have been a long flight. You've lost your feathers. What happened to you? Your face is a mess. - Shoo! - No! This way! Get out of here. It was a pleasure serving you. Run! I will give you a Medal of Honor for your bravery. - It's the basement. - Why did you bring me here? - Can I have a Medal of Honor if I die? - Of course not. Die and keep me safe. Didn't you hear the guns? Let's get out of here. You, take care of him. - The rest of you follow me. - Yes, sir. Shoot him. You idiot! Where did you learn to shoot? Where did he go? Damn it! Who are you shooting at? Is that a gun? I can tell by your face that you want my motorcycle. Take it. Take it. Over there. He's getting away. You didn't have your indicator on. I was about to turn! - Why didn't you slow down? - What is the biggest fish in the world? - Mekong catfish. - Wrong. A whale. What can move at over 80 kilometers per hour and jump over a car? A motorcycle? Damn, why is the bus so late? What was that? They're filming a movie. They did the same thing last week. They closed the road for hours. Look, it's a motorcycle chase scene. Stay calm. An ambulance is coming. Left! Left! I'm still alive and I'm breathing! I'm still smiling. I'm still alive. You fight hard, but someone up there loves me. Here, this car is perfect. Come this way. This one. It's only 300,000 baht. Judging by your appearance and personality... ...l'd say this car is perfect for you. Forty-eight easy installments and first-class auto insurance. How does the horn sound? It startled you, right? So are you interested? How about a test drive? I'll go get the keys, then. I'll be back. Hold on. Let me park first. Okay. Okay. Oh, don't say that. I miss you. Of course I miss you. Come on. Don't say that. I had a bad dream last night. I dreamt my car was stolen. It's okay, though. It's right here. It was just a bad dream. I've got the keys. How about that test drive? What's the hurry there? Calm down. This car is perfect for you. Hey, hurry up! Do you want to die? I've been driving for 20 years and I've never hit a person. I've been crossing roads for 60 years and I've never been hit. Watch yourself, jackass! You have a gun? God, he just keeps coming. Are you an assassin? You missed! Oh, my god, the car is on its side. How is this possible? Let me out! So you want to race? I'm dying for a smoke. Did you order any gas? It looks like this is the end. Special agent of the Anti-Terrorism Task Force of Nongwaileum. - What about the car? - Get it fixed. Right. Get up. Get up. Don't look at me like that. You were hard to catch. Get up. Get going. Secret Service Agency, Nongwaileum Government Why have you arrested me? What did I do? With good looks like these... ...how could I look like a criminal? See what I mean? I have a good family name. My father sells jewelry. My mother works at the national bank. My brother works at the ministry. You're all in deep trouble. How many times have I told you? Think before you act! Do you know how to think? You jackass. I've told you... Hi, sweetheart. I'm at work. I'll be home at 6. Okay, dear. See you then. They are screwed because of you. Where will you get the money to pay for this? Do you think our government can pay? Is your daddy rich? Do you think my father is rich? You! Yes, honey? Noodle soup? I knew you'd like it. Yes, tonight at 6. What kind of noodles? Thin noodles. With lots of fish. See you at 6. It's lucky that the chief doesn't know about this. If he closes down our division... ...what are we going to do? How will we eat? Answer me! I won't be home at 6! Forget about the noodle soup! Get out! Go! My record's perfect. I won Outstanding Citizen awards for three years in a row. I'm suing the lot of you. You too. I'm suing everyone. I'll sue everyone who looks like you. I'll sue everyone with your last name. But I'm not suing myself. Aside from myself, I'm suing everyone. How many times are you going to sue? Don't even ask me about him. What a bore. My husband comes and goes as he pleases. I haven't seen him for days. He's never home. I don't even know what he does for a living. He used to work in construction. But quit after one month. He tried selling insurance... ... and washing powder. He's good for nothing. - How much? - Two hundred. - Keep the change. - There isn't any change, you jackass. This style here. It looks great. - Peek-a-boo! Guess who. - Move your hands, stupid! Can't you see I'm working here? Where have you been? There are dirty clothes all over the house. Go wash them now. - Are you trying to make me angry? - Where is the tub? On my head, maybe. Go! Don't forget your bag. Take it with you. I'm not your maid. Freaking moron. You're good at being stupid. Why are you like this? I'm so tired. What a husband. I'd be better off without him. Why can't you find a job that will last? You have to try and work it out. Understand? Stop bouncing between jobs. When will we ever have any money? Don't you want to own a house or car? You know what to do before bed. Do I always have to remind you? Try to remember for once. The Wife's Commandments How about this? Tomorrow I'll take you across to Thailand... ...to see a guru. People believe that he is holy. That way, you'll get a good job. Do you understand me? How about tonight? It's been a couple of weeks now. Do you want to get kinky? No, I'm too tired. It's been so long. I'm never going to get laid. You're such a pain. Your husband's ran off. It's getting crowed in there. You must keep him entertained. You must please him. Know what? Lean closer. I want you to apply beeswax to your lips. You'll notice a change within two to three days. Boy? Bring me some beeswax. Your husband will be back within a week. Father, we're out of beeswax. That's ok. You can use moist dung instead. Bring in the moist dung. It's horse crap. But I don't know who left it in the rain. Apply it to your lips. You've a got a beautiful smile. Father. Give me your hand. Don't look down. Look up. Be on your way. Your husband will return. This is ridiculous. What's ridiculous? Look for yourself. People all over town have come to see him. Cheun. - Father. - What is it? Father, please help my grandson. Bring him here. What's wrong with his legs? His legs are unemployed. Unemployed? - His legs are unemployed? - Yes, they don't work. Oh, a comedian, eh? I take it you like the Cha-Cha-Cha Gang. I bet you go to bed late. Come here, boy. Hello. Can you fix my legs? It looks quite serious. But they should get better. I think they'll be fine. - Okay, concentrate. - Yes, sir. - Repeat after me. - Okay. Who is repeating after who here? You must repeat after me. Okay, stand up. Walk around. Come back here. Sit down. Cheun, come here. Take him to see a doctor. Okay, be on your way. - Mrs. Keaw? - Yes? - Who is it that with you? - My husband. Step this way. Go! Right under my nose. Don't even try it. Here's my husband. Come this way. - This is your husband? - Yes. Who messed his face up? He was born like that. Come a little bit closer. Let's have a look. Good facial feng shui. You found a good one, lady. You handsome bastard! Don't run. Come closer. Look at those eyebrows! Those are money-making eyebrows. Both the right and left ones. Don't look at me like that, boy. Blink your eyes for me. Take a deep breath in. That's it. Take a good long breath. What a little mouth. It's perfect. Okay, now focus and pray with me. Peek-a-boo! You seem stressed. Lighten up a little. Let's try again. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., you'll have a big assignment. I hope we have an understanding... ...this has to do with our country's stability. Okay. Next... Take a look at these two suspects. This one is the more dangerous of the two. His name is Suchin. The other man is Surachai. He is not such a threat. They are operating in Thailand... ...under a record production company. But behind the scenes... ...they are as dirty as they come. They are amassing a stockpile of weapons... ...to use against their own country. I want someone who can get to them... ...before the KGB or the CIA do. Is there anyone who can fulfill this mission? There is one man. Are you deaf? Answer the goddamn phone! You're asking for it! You haven't got a clue. - She's just teasing. - I know she is. Thanks for believing me. Hello. Yes. Okay. I'll be there. Find them. This is your chance. The two people in this envelope are a national threat. How should I infiltrate them? That's your problem. - Why not give this to someone else? - That's my problem. - What about my wife? - That's your problem. - Telephone. - That's my telephone. I won't forget. Get going and don't screw it up. Go. That's my problem. You're going to be a French teacher? You can't even speak your own language. Just go, then. Come and go as you please. You never do me. You only stay to eat, only live to die. All in all, I lead such a miserable life. - I've become a slave to love... - Get lost! Don't interrupt me. You ruined my song! Not again! Not again. Thala. Do you think before you produce songs? Just look at 4S Studio. They're small but successful. Every song is a hit. My huge company, in all its glory... ...has yet to make a successful album. But, sir, you have to understand that... ...running a record label is a gamble. You can either win or lose. I'm a businessman. I'm not a gambler. I'm done talking to you! Surachai, you talk to him. I've had enough. He's annoying me. I'm about to hit him. Look, Thala... ...you know our company is in trouble. Of the seven to eight albums you've produced... ...not one has been a hit. It's true. I want to call you a dumb-ass... ...but I'm a nice guy. I don't want to call you that. Hot coffee? Didn't you check if it was hot or not? Look, Thala... ...l'm giving you three more months... ...before either I fire you or you quit. It's up to you. For now... ...get your dumb-ass off of my sofa. It's me. I'm fed up. They didn't have a good word to say. Oh, well, forget it. I'll show them. No, I'll call him myself. I'll talk to you later. Check your drawers. What's this? Kind of sticky. Smells like crap. Sir, three people have come for a vocal test. Let me hear them. This way. Over here. - Name? - Amnuay, sir. - Last name? - Huakhad. - Amnuay Huakhad? - Yes. - What are you going to sing? - "Khon Luang Rak." - It's a song from the movie... - I know. Hello Yasothorn. - Have you seen it? - Three times. Do you have a lot of free time, then? That's none of your business. Sing. When a bird leaves its nest It says goodbye by singing "coo" Honey, you left Without saying goodbye Even before a crow leaves its nest It will sing out "coo-coo" That's enough. There's the exit. Coo-coo to you. But I haven't gotten to the chorus yet. - You scared the chorus away. - Go on. Leave. - Next. - Please. Hello. - Name? - Sai. - Song? - "Tears of a Warin Girl." - By Jintara Phulap. - Yes. Go on. A girl from Warin cries For her man from Ubon Never came to see her He ran off with A girl from Sakhon He left the girl from Warin All alone once again - Do you know where the bus station is? - Why? Find a bus back to Warin! Go! Find that crow singing "coo-coo" and hook up. Hello. - It's a bag. - I know. - Name? - Khamlao. - Can you sing? - Yes, beautifully. My friends call me Sinatra. - Can you dance? - I'm an amazing dancer. My friends call me Michael. Let's go. His face. Just look at it. Thala, where did you get this guy? Did you flush him out of a sewer... ...or cut him out of a tree? Oh, my god. Thala, please ask him... ...if that's his face or a cereal box? After such kind words... ...how can you just sit here? Leave. Get out of here. I can see you won't last very long. Hey, whenever I see you, I can't breathe. You make me sick. Now go! Oh, hi, Thala! Hi, Tik. When will you move out of the forest? And do what? I'd just run into the capitalists that control you. Hey, Khamlao. Khamlao. What about Khamlao? - Hello. - Oh, hi. - He's my new star. - Star, you say? - Is he a comedian? - No, a singer. - A singer? - What do you think? I'm not too sure about his face. His body looks good, though. - Have you been in many fights? - He's a singer, not a fighter. I think he might work. He has great facial cemetery. You mean symmetry? If your singer does as I say, he'll be huge. Show me a smile. Yep, you're screwed. - How can I help? - It's like this... ...I need you to teach him some dance moves. - Are you sure? - Yes. - I'm 100 percent sure. - Today? Right now. - Right now, Khamsao. - Khamlao. - Come here. - Okay. - Look, Ngiam... - Khamlao. Right, Khamlao.

Did you think you could avoid me? Did you really think that? Give me my elephant! You idiot! Forget your elephant! Sweet rambutan. Sweet longan. - Yes, dear? - Mangosteen, please. I've sold out. This is all I have. - I'll have some cherries, then. - You're getting on my nerves! - Longan will be fine. - How much? - One kilogram. - Sixty baht. Do you want a bag? No, thanks. - I'll be off, then. - Go, then! - Are you mad? - No. That was close. My noodle stand! Please stop. Don't. Stop. Where's my elephant? It's in the truck. Why did you steal that from him? He's stronger than the lead actor. Rotten luck. Support Thailand. Eat longan. He's lost his mind. What happened? That was a lesson. Don't let me see you again. Come on, Khamlao. I remember you. It was you for sure. You ruined my life. Thala! When I see another man's wife I fill with glee The lyrics flow from him. I want to reshape my wife's face As she is no longer beautiful to me Unfortunately for me My wife is an old hag When I see another man's wife I fill with glee Excellent! Why must it hurt to look at my wife Especially when pregnant? I'm about to die Singing about it only worsens the pain It's my unfortunate fate To have an old wife One day I must cover her face When I'm drunk, I can stand it But not while I'm sober I'd kill her, but I'm afraid of prison When I see another man's wife I fill with glee I want to go home And cover her face for once I like looking at other men's wives But looking at mine drives me insane No one has a wife like mine I can't believe it. You've knocked Body Slam from the charts. Film Rattaphum cannot even compete. He's just released a new album. The square-faced singer. Get it while you can. I believe they are selling out very quickly. Listen to it too. The songs are fun. Some people take the CDs and attach them... ...to the tail of an elephant... ...as a make-shift rear reflector. - Hello. - Hi. Your first album is a huge success. How do you feel? Good. I'm delighted to be with you. Look. I'm still shaking. What style of music do you reflect? It's pop-country. - Do you have a phone number? - Talk about your album. We should say something. Why is it popular? What is the theme? Well, my producer designed it especially for you. Ah, okay. CELEBRATION 1,000,000 ALBUMS SOLD How is it having succeeded in selling 1 million albums? At first I didn't expect this much success. But with perseverance and the right mentor... A diamond in the rough. An angel among demons. - who made me, the man before you, Professor Thala. Actually, when I first saw him, I could sense... ...that he was different. In the end, I knew... There's still the sky above the clouds. There are still flies above a carcass with his singing and dancing. Even though I'd never heard him sing or dance... ...I knew he was destined to be a star. Thank you very much. Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, hi, Paula. Congratulations. I didn't think you'd make it this far. I never thought it'd go this far. Otherwise, I'd have done this long ago. I see. Anyway, I should go. - Paula? - What is it? Shall we have dinner sometime? - Should I? - Of course. Then when? Anytime you're not menstruating. Then not today. Don't forget to buy some tampons. Don't worry about it. That's just how it is. Everyone says that she's his mistress. - Really? - Of course. His wife is keeping an eye on him. Oh, this Thai singer... ...has become so popular. - Who? There, that guy. When I see another man's wife I fill with glee I want to reshape my wife's face As she is no longer beautiful to me You shit! - Calm down, kids. - Are they yours? Yes. Their father has deserted us.

I trust you understand. If you screw it up... ...never show your face here again. You'll never see us again. Good. If that's so, then get yourselves out of my office now. Mummy-Lao, boss. I'll ask you one more time. Where did he come from? He showed up at my office, so I took him to meet you. It's just a coincidence. We should go home. I'm done with him. What a waste of time. Look who's here! - Sorry I'm late. - That's okay. I asked you out, so I don't mind waiting. Did you bring your butt? If so, have a seat. Thank you. Would you like anything? Maybe a little accident. I'd rather not. I'm always getting good luck. I'm not into bad luck. You look exquisite today. Men often say that to me. At first I felt offended, but they can't help it, I'm beautiful. It's like that, huh? You seem full of fun. I'm full of crap too. Hey, what club are you playing at? You sure are funny. I'm just teasing. - Do you come here often? - Once in a while.

I knew when you started singing: When I see another man's wife I fill with glee I want to reshape my wife's face I knew this would happen. You despicable liar. Why are you looking at me? Hello, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers... ...ladies and gentlemen. We are here to honor a certain individual. People like this should be recognized. Our military does not sit idly. Therefore, we have arranged this ceremony... ...to award his bravery. I'd like to recognize him and invite you to honor... ...him, his name and his family. The man known as Captain Khamlao Maknim. That's my husband. I have a new assignment for you. The people in here are vital to this country. Protect them. Let no harm come to them. Not even a scratch. Not even a small one. Please sign for your money. No, I'm not signing that. Mum, you asshole! You got me, didn't you? You got me again! Two movies now, right? You got me! In the first movie, I didn't get to say a word. In the second one, I don't have any lines and you kill me off! You killed me! What are you doing to me, Mum? What are you thinking? You shot me three times. Just as I was about to talk. You shot me. Not once, but three times! Then you shoved your foot in my face! You took it too far! Hey, I said get ready to go! Don't just sit there. Get ready! Hurry. If my mother didn't like you, I'd kick you out! Don't look at me! I've been the lead man in almost every film. Have you ever seen Pattaya Maniac? Have you? The director made me the leading man. I was even above Tao! Did you see that movie? Poj Anont made me a leading actor. Did you see Nong Teng? They were all Workpoint films. That's it. I'm finished with Sahamongkol. That's enough. I'm finished with your films. I'm going to Workpoint. You brought me here at 5 a.m. I came with my family. Then you waited until 3 p.m. to film my scene! What are you filming? I'll break that damn camera! I'm not just some comedian. I'm a superstar! Don't look at me like that. Do you know who I am? People from all over this country love me. Remember this, I'm done with your films. I'd be a dumb-ass to do another one. Let's go home. No, son. Don't. Don't, son. Beating him would be like beating a dog. You won't die because of me. You'll die because of Mot, your wife. Your wife will stab you. Should I say it? Nakhon Sawan. I'll say it. In your room. I'll say it. I knocked on your door, but no one answered. Get in the car. I can't believe you killed me! You let Teng tell jokes, but you killed me. Take a good look at me. You shot me three times. Was that funny? Is the audience laughing? They want me to be funny. Call your boss. Call Somsak... Jeang. Tell him I want to talk. Don't call me. I'm not acting in any more of your movies. I have my own people at Workpoint. People like Panya Nirankul. You vile scum. You goat's sack! You square-face. Let's go, son. Don't bother with him. I'm not doing any more of your movies. - That's enough, son. - You parasite! Mum! Cut.
