A GIRL CALLED JULES Jules! Phone, darling. What a mess. Are you ready, darling? I'II inform Madam. Come in, please. Put it down on here. Splendid! Madam is on time... Phone, Jules. Don't get married. It's worse than Christmas. Would you like a final fitting, Madam? Jules! Answer the phone, will you? No, thanks, were late. My daughter has to be at church already. Her fiancée is an engineer and punctual. Thank you. Best wishes. Jules, phone. You haven't killed yourself by any chance, have you? If you don't want to answer, hand over the line. Leave it, Mother. - Why? It could be Lorenzo. No. You re in crisis. My heads spinning already. I don't understand you. - What's new. Cant you look at me when I'm talking to you? Come on. Give your mother a nice fake smile... The happy groom himself wont fall for it. What can I do for you? - Nothing. Keep on doing nothing for me. Act III. Scene: Mother. What do you want from me? To take you seriously? Darling, its just a wedding. No matter what happens. Hurry up, instead. Lorenzos waiting. Think that tomorrow, God willing... - God doesn't give a damn. Please, God. Tell me what I have to do. Jules. Phone. Why don't you answer the phone, sweetheart? We've got sad eyes... Yes? No, not yet. I'm late. I had to talk to Jules, calm her down. I'll be right down. Slippers, dressing gowns... Forgotten anything? I've put everything in, don't worry. What are you doing? Messing up my hair? You know I'm late? Anything else to put in the bag? - No, thanks. Nothing else, Lia. Do you realise Jenny, uncle Williams daughter sees her mother only once a month? You, instead, are with me. With Lia. You don't go to school... Cheer up. Lia will let you go out. You wont even think about me. Don't look like that. I cant stand staying in Perugia on Sunday. I II be away for just 2 days. Finish off my eyes. You re beautiful. - Don't be silly. You too are a beautiful girl. Its not true. I look like my poor father. No one notices me. Do you think this is the right time for making such a fuss? Take me with you, Mother. Jules, that's enough! I told you I can't. Should I turn on the lights, No. I want to stay in the dark. Are you sure you want nothing? - I'm fine. Come on, be a good girl. Maybe you've got a slight fever. Jules, don't cry. Its nothing. Did you see? She left me alone... She left. - What are you saying? And I? I mean nothing, then? Aren't we here together... you and I? You shouldn't be crying. You know what she's like. She likes to go out... get about. She left with a man? Are you jealous? What kind of person is he? A man, like everybody else. My father wasn't like other men. He loved me. Is it true that he loved me? Of course, darling. He loved you. This is why you re named after him. Like a boy. My handsome boy. A boy... called Julio. I'm not a boy. I'm like my mother. There are many boys called Maria. So what? Jules, ignore the boys. Don't let them touch you. You didn't do it, is that right? No, I didn't. Nor did I, you know? You must never believe what they tell you. They're just nasty. Jules, you don't know what men are capable of doing to us. What do they do to us? They just do us harm. You should never let them touch you. You must always be the way you are. Pure... Beautiful... Like an angel. Did I frighten you? - No. But you didn't need to touch me. I'm sorry. Shall I come with you? I haven't seen you for quite a while. Well, I've been studying a lot for my final examination. Can we see each other often? I might coach you in maths. I'm very good at maths. - But you got a D. How do you know? - My sister told me. Its an excuse to stay with you. I don't need private lessons. Lia is there to help me. I see. So, did you pluck up your courage? The special edition of The Smoocher: At what level are you? Zero? Mind your own business. - Did you get to the knickers? Go to hell. - He hasn't yet. Sorry. I don't know what came over them. Id really like to get engaged to you. - I cant do that. But, I really love you, Jules. I'll marry you when I graduate. I II never get married. Men are evil. What? I want to make you happy. So, lets get engaged. Only, you must never touch me. Swear. - I swear. I've got something for you. You know... I've always had it with me, waiting to find the courage to speak to you. I've got nothing to give to you. Wait. I know it was just a fling. - You won't do that. Why? When its over, its over. Its not a matter of pride. We'll make a spectacle of ourselves. Have we no dignity? You miss that man, Mother? Forgive me, Jules. It wont happen again. I II always be with you. You always say that but then... - I swear to you. If you were a bit older... If you could understand... Lets run away. Well leave Perugia and go to another town, perhaps. To the sea. You like the sea? Do you need anything? No, thank you, Lia. You can go to sleep. Come, Jules. I'll make your bed. No, Lia. Tonight, I'm sleeping in my mother's bed. Of course, dear, of course. You'll like the sea hugely. You II become dark-skinned like a black boy. Lia will prepare everything. Well leave tomorrow evening. Alright? But... Its better if we don't take Lia along. - Why? Send her back to Venice. I want to be alone with you. Jules. Hurry up, darling. - Yes, Mother. Try shaking her up. I'm going to the bank. Where did I put my purse? Here it is, Madam. Don't worry. Everything's about ready. Packing crates and bags... I feel like a drifter. Look at this foam. Its so soft and perfumed. It's for women. For girls like you, it takes soap. Now think about becoming a woman. Come, I'll wash your back. - When will I become a woman? You're already becoming one. It's a matter of months. What a bore. One always has to wait. I want to grow up right away. I have to get married. Get married? Who to? - Lorenzo. We were engaged. What did you do with him? You want to get pregnant? To become old and ugly? Forget about your Lorenzo. Hell never be able to give you what I can give you. Luckily, you're leaving tonight. Don't end up like other girls. Like what? Look at yourself, Jules. You re beautiful. You need no one... You don't need me either. Don't forget it. Even if we shouldn't see each other again. Yes, Lia. It's nice... Anyway, it's the last time. It's the last time. The last time... More greetings cards for you. And a package too. Excuse me. At least, sign the delivery note. Franco? It's me, Jules. Jules, my love. I've been trying to get you all morning. I couldn't. I didn't dare to. You're insane. Listen to me, please. I didn't tell him anything. I can't. Its too late. You have to, Jules. I love you and you love me. There's nothing... more important than you. - What am I to do, my love? Tell him the truth. Or else, I will. I II pick you up as you leave the church. Don't go through with it, Jules. Promise me. I will. I'll do as you say. Is it free? Where to? - Santa Maria del Giglio. May I go out for a while? - Ask my mother. She's resting upstairs. Fine. You can go. In the name of The Father, The Son and Holy Ghost. So, my child. You've got nothing to tell me? I think... I've sinned. My child. I've brought you the magazines. - That's very kind. You re a maid today? The worlds back to front and exercise keeps you young. Vogue rejected your article? Not at all! Last months article was 3/ 4 of the page. Leave it. Your mother will take it out on me if you don't eat any lunch. Mind your own business. Idiot. Sorry but I'm so angry today... Everyone annoys me. Did something happen to you? Father Dario upset me. Why? What did he do to you? - Want to know? He kissed me. Good Heavens. - Yes. A priest. Where did he do it? In the sacristy. I was saying a prayer... It hadn't even occurred to me. He came close to me and he kissed me. How? Like this. Look. You're mad. Hi. Serafina can't come. Why? She's busy. - How do you know? Because she works at my place. Is this moped yours? - Yes. Why don't teach me how to ride? No. It's dangerous. Besides... it leaks oil from the exhaust. You'll dirty your dress. If it gets dirty, I'll wash it. Alright then. My name is Amerigo. - And I'm Jules. Slowly. Watch out. Where's the brake? Damn it! Are you mad? I got hurt. Nice mechanic you are. You taught me nothing. Really? Go home on foot. I'm going to the cinema. - You re going to Serafinas. I saw you the other day, on the beach. Well done. Did you enjoy watching? You have to be with me only. So you can teach me to ride a moped... and many other things. Will you give me a kiss? Come on. Wake up. Get to work. Go to school. I've been up since seven o'clock. What's wrong, darling? Don't you feel well? It's nothing. Come on, get up. Congratulations. Don't look so scared. You've have nothing to be ashamed of. You're not a girl anymore, that's all. Come on. Get up! What are you doing here at this hour? Where have you been lately? Away. I had things to do. I must go back to bed. So... Will you tell me where you've been? I was sick. It's been a nightmare. I wanted to die. I've always been that way. Lifeless, like now. I wasn't feeling at ease. Everything was different. I didn't know what to believe. It was as if everything was falling apart. And no one could help me. But, it's over now. Yes. But, I've changed completely. They saw you with Amerigo. Firstly, you should say good evening. Secondly, I went for a ride. Yes? And then? Liar! You know he's my boyfriend. I didn't do anything. Besides, I don't care about Amerigo. I've been out but not too far. It's nicer at night. Besides, it's not even chilly. Lorenzo has just phoned. He's coming tomorrow. He'll be studying engineering in Rome. He's coming specially to see you. Who are you writing to? To the bank. I bought a textile mill. It was Uncle Ubaldos idea. It seems a good investment. Mother, am I very rich? We own some factories here and two coal mines in Cardiff. Why don't we go back to London? Our home is there. The house my father was born in. Our home is the place where we wake up, he used to say. Yet, I'm eager to go back to London. I often think about it, you know? I feel it's important to me. There's no turning back. Life is full of departures. Where did she go? Madam, I'm going to check the pine-woods. - Thank you. Jules! Where are you? They're shouting themselves hoarse. Why don't you go? No, I won't. - Isn't he your fiancée? What does it matter? I want a kiss now. Go and ask Father Dario for a kiss. Who told you that? Serafina? It's not true. She's envious, that's why she made it up. Priest's girlfriend. - It's not true. He did it all of a sudden. I didn't want to. I ran off immediately. You really didn't want it? I want to be kissed only by you. What's wrong? - That's it. I want to make love. Why? What are we doing? No. Real love-making between a man and a woman. You don't know what men are capable of doing to us. Men only do harm. Do you love me? I do, but you must let me do it. What does she have against me? Nothing. She has a grudge against me. And since I like you, she punishes me. I don't appeal to her as a mother. I don't let her live like others do. Tell her to write to me, if she wants to. Is that it? - You didn't enjoy it? You hurt me. Because you didn't help me. What was I supposed to do? Forget it, there's nothing more we can do. - Why? You're strange. What do you mean by strange? You're different. From Serafina, for example. Everything's easier with her. But you... Do you love me or her? I love you but what am I to do? Say, am I strange? - Are you stupid or what? Let me see. Copy it out. There are five minutes left. You didn't notice it? - What do you take us for? Well, he's a professor. He looks so serious. Like all dirty old men, I can tell you. During the philosophy lesson, he couldn't take his eyes off you. It's obvious he's looking for Platos aesthetics in you. Are you coming, Jules? How boring. - Were you going to the cinema? No, just going for a walk. - So am I. So, let's stroll together. Like Aristotle and his pupils. - With pleasure. But why aren't you out with your girlfriends? - I have none. What's wrong with you? I've been waiting for you at the usual place... You shouldn't anymore. Why? What did I do to you? You re just a boy. Do you like it? Want to read others? I have plenty of them. Do you find me strange? No, Jules. Not strange. You're different... Better, I mean. You are... A girl who understands. Let me explain. A girl older than her years. You're still to be discovered, to be formed. Mother, the philosophy professor asked me to marry him and I said yes. Is that a joke? A funny one, I hope. Its true. He loves me. He embraced me and told me he needs me so much. Thank you, dear. I have a stomach ache. See how helpful a mother is? I'm going to do our packing. Were leaving tomorrow. We've arrived at St. Maria del Giglio. Good morning and welcome back. Take a look. We're setting it up for tomorrow. Has my fiancée come? No. He hasn't arrived yet. Don't worry, he wont be late. The engineer has always been so punctual. Meanwhile, would you like to confess? No point, Father. I'm not getting married. Sorry? - I wont get married. I just came to tell Lorenzo. If there's a problem... I can help you, you know. - No one can help me, Father. My child. Perhaps this delay is a sign of Providence. Don't do something you'll regret. You may speak to God in confession. No. Its not about confessing. I just can't get married. I'll never make my husband happy. - How can you tell? These qualms prove that, deep down, you are a sensitive and honest soul. You'll make your Lorenzo happy. Don't you understand, Father? - What? Physically, I'm imperfect. I realised it some time ago. But I didn't talk about it. I was ashamed. And I was hoping for a miracle. You're bored because you're associating with boys. Come with me. I'll amuse you. I don't understand. Here's someone who always thinks about us. As soon as he found out were here, he rushed over to Cortina. Romantic, isn't it? - Who's that man? Luciano, the owner. Come. I'll show you to the room. Did you hurt yourself? - No. The binding has cracked. I thought you were angry at me... for what happened last night. You're beginning to like me, aren't you? Does it mean that much to you? - Of course. Yes. I love you, I suppose. You always know what's right and what's wrong. Last night. You were right. While I am... the way you saw me. I want to be you. - Why don't you try? It's easy. All you have to do is find an important reason. I have you. Give it me. Luckily, you lit the fire. Its so cold, isn't it? You're an expert on blizzards? - A little. How long is this one going to last? I'm afraid it will last until morning. It was clear an hour ago. - We were skiing. No one ever comes here? - Alpine troops do. During the manoeuvres. We must spend the night here? - Your mother will be worried. The cold worries me. - You can sleep in my sleeping bag. Sorry. And you? I'm a hot-blooded fellow. Thank you. - Not at all. Its nice. - Is that one La Tofana? Yes, it's La Tofana. You asked me the same question yesterday. Well? Nothing more to say? What shall I say? You re afraid to talk to me. Me? - Yes, you. You re wrong. Hi, Jules. Do you want a ride on the snow-mobile? Have you heard the latest, Camillo? Luciano is afraid of me. Why, when you're so pretty? Am I? You are gorgeous. - Not in the least. You're unpleasant and ugly too. - Listen to the expert. She's the prettiest girl in Cortina. So, are you coming? - She can't. She must wait for her fiancée. Mind your own business. Shall we go? Are you comfortable? Jules, wait. - Lets go. Its nothing. Shall we return? - Let's stop here. It's so nice. It's cold. I'll give you my gloves. By the way. I have to give you back your sleeping bag. Keep it, as a memento. You want me to remember you? For you. Your fiancée has up sticks and says goodbye. Jules, you love me in a strange way. Perhaps its my fault. I can't be important enough to you. I'm in the way, is that it? And perhaps I'm in the way everywhere to you. Think it over. However, if you need me, I'll always be there for you. Always the same, as before. Don't forget it. Lorenzo. As soon as he gets a chance, he'll come back. He's a faithful chap. You don't love him. Otherwise, you wouldn't be speaking like that. Have you been together long? All our lives. We were children. I was thirteen. I'm nineteen now. How old are you? I've told you several times. I'm almost seventeen. You only talk about people's ages. My age. Luciano's age. What does age matter? Luciano is twenty-three. He's already a man. I don't like him. You really don't like him? I like you. 324,000 in all. It's good? Fine. How are your love affairs going? - And yours? Rather bad. Why? - Well, no reason. I'm going upstairs. I'd like to sleep. You're a fine one! Tell me. What do you want? I want to stay with you. - I don't. I want to sleep. You're in your room. Sleep. Is this going to continue for long? Go away. Let go of me. Yes? - Sorry. Were you sleeping? Yes. To tell the truth, I was. I'm awfully tired. See you later, then. - Fine. Let's try it again. Don't give up. Its useless. You're odd. All men are egoists. Is it my fault if you don't feel anything? Besides, you won't let me do it. How can I believe that you're still a virgin? You have to have a feeling for such things. What's it to you? I'll tell you! You only like Camillo and your fiancée because none of them asks you to do what you're afraid of. Making love. Shall we go down track N4? Track N1 is more fun. But, it's unsafe. - Come on, you chicken. Hurry up. How are you feeling? There's someone who wants to come in. It's Lorenzo. He says it's his fault and that he should have stayed. He's very upset. Let's leave. I no longer want to stay in Cortina. How about Venice? You'll like it, you'll see. Now, try to forget what happened. You have to resign yourself. Listen to me. I'll let him in. Think it over. You want to ruin his life because of these obscenities? Sex comes last in a marriage. Confide in God. God. Always God. Everything depends on God. I have to talk to you. - Sorry, we must go now. I've barely got time to catch a train. I must be in Perugia tonight. What happened? - My father had a heart attack. Go away. - Tell him. Who's that man? - A... painter. By the way. Before I forget. The house keys. They'll bring the furniture at three. Be there slightly earlier. You never change. I only have to let myself be guided by you. To stop being Jules. I tried, but I didn't succeed. We must get married now. We have a house, too. It resembles you: elegant, sturdy, calm. I was just telling your fiancée that the construction is practical although constrained by the environment. Happy? Do you like it? - So long as you like it. It's just the house I wanted. Quiet, sturdy, elegant. I'd like to show it to your mother. Phone her. Will you wait for me here? - Yes, with the architect. Want to see a curious thing? One token, please. You only managed to enliven me. The need for a true encounter. It was an experiment. That's what Marco was. I come to Venice once a week. Not too far from Trieste. You are Triestine? I have a small factory there. I live well without overdoing it. My family doesn't lack for anything. I'm married, you know. With two children. Two lovely boys. Sorry. I'd rather let you know. I'll marry in a few months. And your fiancée... Is he in Venice? I'm pleased that you're an honest girl. I'm certainly not looking for an affair. Don't worry. I enjoyed it all the same. Well... Quite a lot. If you want, we can meet again. No. Why bother? You know this is what it is every time. You enjoyed it all the same... But, if you knew how I felt... I sought refuge in Lorenzo. To me, he was an anchor for my fickleness. Mother insisted. We talked about the wedding again. What do you think? It seems a bit small to me. Let's see the others, shall we? Fine, but they're all alike. - It's better. What a lovely kitchen! - It's not bad. It's a bit large. Look. But if you like it, we could move the sink. What do you say? Jules! Look here. There's also a microwave. - Jules! Who's that? Lia. Don't you remember her? My girl. - How nice to see you. My dear... You've changed a little, you know? Have I? For the worse? No. You re gorgeous. Remember Lorenzo? Of course. Don't tell me that after all these years... you're still engaged? We'll get married as soon as I graduate. I'm glad. You make such a lovely couple. We must celebrate this meeting. Come over for a drink. I live nearby. Jules, don't say no. Id like to, but we still have to do some shopping. Not at all! I must hop over to the building site. Go! I know it'll make you happy. See you tonight at your place. Not really a housekeeper. A little more, a little less. I would say... A secretary. Franco is lonesome... Rich. And he inherited a fortune in paintings. So, he likes to paint. With some success, too. What do you think? You like them? You see... There's such a freedom in these paintings. Such imagination. They make you think that everything is possible. Happiness too. Are you happy, Jules? You will marry him? Hold it. You were gorgeous. And this... is much faster than my paintbrushes. I'm Franco. Lia must have told you about me. She always does that. And this is Jules. I haven't seen her for years. Yes. A girl called Jules. Julia, from now on. Sounds better than Jules. No. Don't take this funny masculine name from her. Prepare yourselves to be impressed. Here's my masterpiece. Come. I'll show you the most beautiful pieces of my collection. You're beautiful, Julia. I want to see you again. Jules. What a surprise. How come you're here? I've got to talk to you. - Of course. Come. What's so important? Let's bring forward the wedding. Let's get married, Lorenzo. Now. Don't be childish. There are few months to go. I still have to graduate, you know. I'm afraid to wait. Why does no one ever help me? Take me away. Let's get married right away and let's go away. It's not possible. And... There are rules and customs. Surely, they're trifles but... We mustn't disregard them. Why are you afraid of shadows? We'll wait, my love. For the first time I feel happy. I love you, Franco. I love you too, Julia. It doesn't matter. I'm not superstitious. Why don't you stay with me tonight? Truth is you don't want to make up your mind. You're thinking of marrying Lorenzo. - No, Franco. It's not that. You've got to tell him about us, understood? I try to do that each time. But then, I lose heart. Obviously, you still love him. I love you. What's it to you if I marry him? If that's what you want, hurry up. What are you waiting for? Promise me that you'll tell him. I will. - So, let's go there right away. Jiulia, if you love me, there's no other thing in the world. We've arrived. - Wait for the lady. I'll call you. If father's condition worsens well have to postpone it for a few days. Forgive me, Lorenzo. Its over. I love someone else. I can't marry you. I love someone else. The Professor is awaiting you. Come in. Who sent you? Nobody. I found your name in the phone book. What troubles you? I'm afraid I'm frigid. I'm unable to have intercourse. I can, to a certain extent. Then, I get scared and I can't feel any pleasure. You're very young. When did you have the first... lets say, negative experience? At fourteen. Come this way, please. Now, I'll have to ask you a very direct question. You have never reached orgasm? Not with a man, I mean. I have, a few times. But I don't want to. I don't like it. Pull her down. Put your legs on the stirrups. Come on. Calm down. It's nothing. Good. Well done. Does it hurt you? No. Not much. And now? Anatomically, you're normal. The hymen is a bit thick. That's all. Certainly, it's no help to you. So, there's nothing you can do? I can make an incision. Of course, you wont feel anything with a local anaesthetic. Alright. Provided it wont take long. Anaesthetic. It'll take only a minute, you II see. Scalpel. Thermocautery. Come on. Gauze. Compress. Were almost done. See? It was simple. Now, stay calm for ten minutes. And when you make love... Relax. Don't wait for pleasure for fear that it won't come. Sex... is in here. Don't seek pleasure only. It doesn't really exist. Search for love. Pleasure will follow. Lia, go away, please. I want to be alone. Come on, Lia. Not tonight. Do you hear? Wait. Search for love. Its too late. I'm Jules, Franco. Just Jules. What are you doing here? Nothing. I came to see the Devil's tree. With a knife? People come here to make love. It's not a knife. It's a penknife. Who knows where the Devil got to? I've never see him in the tree. Look. I work over there. In that factory. I'm the caretaker. It's deserted today. Why don't you come? Shall we go? Do you want to?
