Kimiko is grown up now. Must be. She was a cute girl of elementary school then. Now, she is a teacher of Koa Gakkan.

Good talking was it. He is my old friend. An old man, um, that young man. He is son of Dr. Tsumura who took care of me while I was in Tokyo. Have you met him accidentally? Yes. Good luck of coincidence. You cannot meet him forever if you didn't meet him now. What? He is a smart reporter of Chuka Nippo. He is an obstacle to us. Are you planning... Chin-san, Leave it there. Bring his belongings to this room. You can't do to him... You don't need to worry about it. He is my best friend. Don't do to him. You go Japan. That's all. This is registry. I give you a name card of Japanese, These are useful to deceive the eye of police authorities. The president of shinkosei association, a man of educational sector, Lieutenant colonel Horiguchi This is useful. Is this all right? Miss, you have a good body. Don't you want to marry him? Office of Shanghai MP of Japan Chief, it is reported he contacted this man. I see. Did he meet this man later? Thank you. Kisaragi, how about the young man then? Round face, 27 to 28 years old, long haired good-looking man. Name unknown. OK. Aim at the target at once. Yes sir, we aim at the target. Fujita, prepare for homeland too. Telegram; August 6th, sender; the chief of military policemen of Shanghai, Receiver; the chief of the 5th department of headquarters of military policemen, Copy: Nagasaki, chief MP, The text; an information obtained that, under the order of Chongqing, a person will supposedly sneak in Tokyo within 4-5 days. the one; name unknown, male, 27-28 years old, round face, long haired, good-looking, acquaintance of Tsumura someone, at Kamiuma-cho, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo. Over. Special Issue. Thus, the spies sneaked into Japan one after another. We keep an eye on the spies as possible, however, it is impossible to protect against the spies completely by limited eyes of military policemen. we need to perform the total war in this field. Military service is limited in a certain level, however, this counterintelligence has no limit. Anyone, old or young, male or female, has to join in order to protect the country. Spies; against the invisible enemy. we call the battle against them a secret war. The secret war is performed in propaganda and plot, Information means to seek the opponent's figure, propaganda means to lead the people of the opponent to the way which is advantageous to the friend side. Plot means to weaken the power of the enemy within the enemy secretly, and destroy the enemy nation. The two, propaganda and plot, are the main issues in the secret war. This penetrates your weakness and takes their advantage under the circumstances, that is the principle. For example, when someone starts to complain a shortage of rice, the secret hand of the enemy immediately spreads a rumor, that rice will disappear instantly. at the same time they start to buy up rice and, try to enhance the complain in the people that would result in weakening the national power. When the workers starts to complain the hardships, the secret hand tries to make a conflict between employers and employees, encourage the strike, and to damage the national power. Information is used for the propaganda or plot which is collected for preliminary fighting. They maneuver to get the secret of the army, as well as the materials for armed warfare. As our counter intelligence was enhanced their tactics began to be more sophisticated. They collect fragmental information in small sectors, then integrated them all to get the secret perfectly. Now I will tell you a good example. Major Robertson What's for today? I'm invited for dinner party by the British Embassy. I see. I brought you the latest magazine issue. Let me see. What do you think of this picture? Working ladies, at the moment leaving shops. Another one is, Leather was sent for soldiers in the front. Office works wearing sandals. Do you understand the value of this picture? I will use it immediately. Good material. Please do. And, a new factory was built in Osaka. It matched to the information last time. Yes it is. We were informed. What is this? It seems for Thai. We are now investigating. I'm sure it is true. at an early date. I heard just now that many men were recruited to be sent to the south. Well-known intellectual persons were recruited like this. Considering their clothing, all are for the south. It is said something similar to PK of Germany will be made. Is it so? Will you press the button? And, start the issue of the stocks immediately. I expect you to make lower and lower. It is the best way to make the people uneasy. It is true. Especially during the prolonged Japan- Us meeting, some people are scared of dropping of their stock prices. Certainly sir. I can handle that issue. Please. Japanese people are soft-boiled. Major, May I help you sir? Investigate those persons as shown in the list. One more thing, Another? More and more. We have a lot of things to do. Japan-US war does not start yet, but it means simply armed warfare does not. Our secret war is in the highest point now. I understand sir. By the secret war, shall we add a new star on the Stars and Stripes? Do with the spirit. I will do. OK. Come. About the issue of rice, To the latest information, Japan is int short of rice due to the loss in Korea, so the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is importing rice secretly from abroad as much as tens of millions. You got a good news. That is our secret war. We have done already by pulling the strings of British Embassy in Thailand and a British company in Thailand bought all the Thai rice with tripled price. If Japan comes to buy, they will find nothing. No rice left which can be bought by Japan for cheap price. So we won. So, using this, make the people uneasy so that they don't want war anymore. Spread a rumor for that. I see. Food matters all. Japanese will be upset if they find no rice. Our secret war is not called successful if we do not reach the point. What was your masterpiece lately? I laughed at that. In the front, the soldiers were washing with gasoline. The rumor made by us came back to us. Next, I am thinking about the drafting ordinance, which is a topic of these days. Do it too. You are genius liar. I want you call me a great creator. In the significant moment in the life, a fiction can be truth. This is a kind of art. Art? Art, that's it. But it is not a lie. No kidding. No kidding. Is it? You believe that the soldiers in the front are washing with gasoline, but don't believe what I say. Welcome. Good evening. You are working hard. Listen Nolan-san, I have been teased by Takeda-san. For what? He said, last night Chiang Kai-shek was dead in Chongqing. What? He said, Chiang kai-shek was killed suddenly by bombing during dinner. He swallowed shumai hurriedly. That was his end, he said. I see. You know it. Me? No, not at all. Give me sake. You are smart guy. You must know it. Don't say. You see madam? I am not a person who can be a subject of Kenpei (military police). I am your kamo, easy victim. I'm not sure sir. I am captured by beautiful Yuri. Nice flattery. But I feel good to hear it. I envy you. Listen, why can you be a kamo (easy victim) of me too? No, you can't. First of all, you are not beautiful as Yuri. Yes, I have hard face to you. Well, what do you think of my face? I am used to live by eating humans. Yes, you are, in looking innocent. Give me bill. Thank you very much. Are you leaving so soon? Looks like I'm avoided. Can I take this? Please. Manila tobacco. Rare. Do you want match? No, ok. You sleep well. Regardless of the emergency time. Thank you very much sir. Excuse me. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good night. Sleep well. Still sleeping. Wake up. You will catch a cold. Now, I leave. Better do so. Watch you! Are you all right? I'm OK. Give me water. Give him water. Give this Raul tomorrow. Certainly, in the afternoon. Here you are. Japanese sake getting terrible these days. Good-bye. Good-bye. Be careful. Take care. OK. Fu-chan, clean there. The young man is your kamo as well? I don't know. Just a month ago he started to visit. Good man. Good man? I see. You are good at it. Give me that. Where is young boy today? He is gone. By drafting. Draft? It was so sudden that I cannot find substitute for him. That's pity. I heard many draftings these days. If someone enjoyed fishing in weekend, he is draft quickly. Is it true? Yes, true. You can't enjoy leisure time these days. Rice is in short, fishes too. That's true. You know, rice is left and rotten in the Chinese front, they say. And the soldiers are giving rice to Chinese. Are they doing such thing? That's why we are in short. Yes it is. Okaerinasai (welcome back). Tadaima (I'm back). You are back so late. Yes, I met a friend. Don't spend your time so much for night pleasure. Sorry. I have been waiting you. Why? I want you see something. What is it? The box for China-dolls are ready, but I don't know how to arrange. I see. The souvenir from your brother. Yes. My knowledge is of Kwangtung style. It varies locally. Good. Please. Wow, fine box. Beautiful, isn't it? Gently. First, flag-bearer is heading. Flag-bearer? Is this? Yes. The surname of bridegroom is written on the flag. So if it you, Oh (Wang) is written. Yes, if I am the bridegroom. Next, lantern carrier. That one too. Next, big flag-bearer. That one. How about bride? Bride is the last. What a gorgeous wedding. Why don't you make your wedding like this? Well, it is like fairy tale. With joyful music the procession continues. The time is, apricot is blooming. nightingale singing, brilliant red reflects in the greens covered by spring haze. When you are back China, you will get a bride. I don't know who can come to me. Sure. Many. No matter how many. I need the one like you. Now, cover the box. Help me. Listen, Oh-san. Don't give Japanese woman an empty flattery. It is not flattery. You have arranged nicely. Oh-san taught me. Your kimono is ready. Thank you. I will change. Thank you. Not at all. We have to give him obi-age sash. O, yes. There must be Tsuneo's. Yes, must be. Maybe in the bottom. God. Broken. Use this. I was wondering how to girdle. This is your brother's, isn't it? Can I borrow? Please. How do I look? Yes. Good. You look like brother. Shituke (tacking thread) should be removed. Remove this? Madam calls you. What's the matter? Tsuneo-sama was dead. Brother? Wait. What happened? She got a call from the newspaper company. He was assassinated in Shanghai. Assassination? Ko-a Gakkan (Asian Development School) Sensei (teacher), Your brother was killed in China. Still you don't have any bad feelings to China? Why? Well, everyone saying so. What are they saying? Kinran, stop. What is it? No, nothing. Tell me please. Please don't be mad. Since your brother was passed away in China, someone says sensei must have bad feelings to us too. Who said such thing? No one in particular. We started to say so. I have no bad feeling to you, not at all. But he was killed by Chinese. You don't feel bad to us Chinese? Kinran, every Japanese has lost his or her loved ones, parents, brothers, or friends in battles in China. But nobody has bad feelings to you. You are good friends of us. The one who killed my brother was not our friend. Our enemy is Chiang government. I told you so. Can you understand? Sorry. Let's start practice. Start with the part of yesterday. You say we should believe Japanese but how far can we believe, that's risky. If we do as you say, where is the trust between humans? We came Japan for study because we trust Japan and rely on Japan. What we need is not words nor statements, but reality. You don't know because you are far away China for long time. Look the real China. Wherever you go you see Japanese forces. No, it's not true. Without the support of Japanese army, the new Nationalist Government cannot do. Japan helped the new Government. We have to watch the reality as it is. OK. What do you think about this example? Speak without any prejudice. You have no passion for China. What? No passion? Stop. Have I no passion? Stop. I understand your mind, but there is a reason in the words of Oh too. You are smarter. No need to talk such blockhead. I will leave. Good-bye. He is perverse. Just a conflict of opinions. They say Japan gave the Chinese people rice. We shouldn't doubt their kindness. But it is demagogy. I see now. I thought it strange. Even if we have to send the rice to the soldiers in front, how come so huge shortage happened in homeland. Front or not we have been eating the same amount of rice. Yes, they gave all to Chinese. It is a matter of course we have no rice here. I see. Someone said that a man went for fishing and was drafted because the fishing is outrageous in the time of emergency. Oh, it was you, dear. You are early. I have a reason. What reason? Because you keep staying on my mind. Liar. Welcome back sir. Futures 130-yen 2-yen 50-sen, 30-sen lower, 60-sen lower, Shintsune 90-yen 50-sen, 60-sen lower, Don't disturb my business. I don't like it. Noisy What are you going to do if the stocks drop? My company will suffer. Yuri will be in trouble too. Helpless. Yuri, move away. No. You can't listen until I leave. It will be late. Look at me. Wow, Max Factor. How could you obtain? See? Thank you. Toyo kisen ship, 89-yen 80-sen, 1-yen 20-sen lower. ...40-sen lower. OK. I allow you. 40-sen higher, The master is at home? Yes he his sir. Oh-san. I visit you again. Welcome. Can you understand this? Not at all. This is interesting thing, you know. You can see everything by sitting. It suggests the move of the meeting between Ambassador Nomura and President Roosevelt. The move of the stocks is so sensitive. I regard the stocks an expression of the nation. Our trick is to catch the expression. Trick? Oh-san, the secret of the trick is hidden in your pocket. Don't be shocked. I am the magician. Hello, welcome. I'm sorry for last night. You got terribly drunk. I didn't mean it. Are you going out? Yes, my business begins. I will go. Oh-san you can stay long. I will be back early today. Thank you. Bye. She is good wife. She looks charming always. Thank you. Madam, are you going out? Bye. Oh-san, I tried so hard until I got Yuri in my hand. I think I made a poor Japanese girl happy. Yuri appreciates me. She told me such as that "I will not leave you whatever happens." But, Yuri does not know my identity. I think that's better for her. Listen Oh-san, You must keep the secret. I do. Now, let me see that one. What is this? The order on the stocks. This stock is most implicated with US and UK. I will sell all tomorrow. The business world which is maneuvered by them will be more restless. The Japanese businessmen hate to fight against US and UK, if it just because of their personal benefits. Very convenient mechanism to us. Mechanism. Oh-san, this is not pleasant business. I began to think so. Maybe I am aging. Then why do you continue this business at all risks? I can't help it. You can't help it? Yes. How about you, Oh-san? Me? I do this because I love my country. My blood is boiling for the love to China. I never mind any danger to me. I see. So? I devote my country by sacrificing myself. I have no other way to live. I envy you. Patriot Oh Yuho has his country. You have also. Me? Do I have my country? You have. Philippines is your... Shhh! Can you hear? From Hong Kong. I have my hometown but I have no country. Oh-san, listen me. About my hometown. My hometown is Davao. It is a capital of Mindanao island located on the southern edge of Philippines. My father is Philippino and my mother Cantonese. So I have your country's blood also. Davao is my lovely hometown. However, it is not my country. Do you understand? I was yelled when I took a sweet mango with my small hand. All are owned by American, even a tree of mango. For long time since my hometown was conquered by Spain, we lost independence. But once... We are told like fairy tale about Jose Rizal. The patriot Jose Rizal made our blood boiling as child. Rizal is a Philippino Asian. Never be American. Raul-san, are you all right? I'm all right. Thank you. Tobacco is not good for you. I can't stop this. I feel this disease will be cured if I return hometown. Doctor recommends so. Oh-san, You never needed this medicine, I assume. What is this? Strong sedative. It must be poisonous. One bottle is fatal. But to me this is most important thing after Yuri. I feel my soul is rescued by this even it only a little. Take a rest for a while. Oh-san, why the night of harbor-town makes us so nostalgic? I also remember the night of Kwantung. I wish I can return Davao. Build a small house on a hill, cover the scorching sun with palm leaves, eat mango full, look up Southern Cross at night, with Yuri. Do you want to return so badly? My disease, tuberculosis, will be fine there. Oh-san, you said you love China, didn't you? Yes, I want to hold it to my chest. Holding China? or Chiang government? China, of course. That's good. Why? Don't be manipulated by US and UK. China must be eternal China. Since I was born, I saw a number of their towns so far. I am doing the current job just as business. In a way I am most disgusting man. But I have no hope nor passion. What I have is just a dream. Your young passionate cry made me confess something unlike me. But, order is order. If you are thinking like that, you can't rely on yourself, Order, you say. I will do it of course. I will make the price down. You will see. Hello, Nolan. Yes, that issue. How about the stock market? I told you. I knew it would drop. How about your members? They are upset, aren't they? How about your prospect? Lower on? Do you have such materials? The prolonged meeting of Japan-US made the people uneasy. I am thinking to cut as the opening of session tomorrow. OK. If you have good information, please tell me. Yes sir. Excuse me. This picture is not good. It didn't show the whole aspect. Take in the overhead view. But to avoid the surrounding buildings, I can't help... Military policemen are alert. Don't care about it. Japan Kaiho is a culture magazine of Japan. Can you show such picture to the people of the world? Be brave. Is the man his patron? I see. That's why Nolan is flattering him. Please, please. You, what is your terrible behavior today? Do you think you can disturb the financial sector in Japan by such small trick? I ordered you to destroy to the bottom of bottom. But, look. Only 3-yen lower. I am too well-known of my face. Too well-known of you face? Too dangerous to go further. Danger? Every our job starts with danger. Think that, for what reason did we make you capitalist? We supplied you huge money. You are allowed to live freely. Nevertheless, the reward to us is your failure today. Nolan, don't make me suffer anymore. No, your body is not yours. I can't anymore... Raul-san, I told you so sir. What is it? Takeda-san is visiting sir. Who is it? Kenpei (military policeman). Welcome, Long time no see. No, not long time sir. Is it? What's, today? Plenty time for talk. You must say I am out when I have a guest. You seem busy as always sir. Yes, too busy. Please have a seat. Nice aroma. I wonder what is it. Manila tobacco is so distinctive. I, half-smoked. Strange hobby. You must close the emergency exit. It's cold. I'd like to ask about it. What is it? Don't be so challenging. I think you know this. What building is this, in New York? In New York? I don't know sir. You were living in New York? Yes, when I was a baby. So long time you were living there. You were 28 years old when you were fired by Chevrolet distribution shop. Yes, it was spring when I was 28 years old. Don't lie. You were 26 years old. Oh? Yes, you were lieutenant then. Yes I was. You are clever. No, not as clever as you. I tell you what this building is. This is a famous prison. Come on. Chief, This is informed by Shanghai MP. He met Chin Shingyo in Shanghai. Chin Shingyo is a terrorist, expert of assassination. I thought something wrong in him. He went in the back street of Ginza, Yes, the bar Red Lilly. Oh Yuho visited there several times. Up to now, he is trying to make ideological disturbance mainly among Chinese saying in Japan, and Manchurian, as well as checking the munition factories, and try to gather information of intelligence. Days ago he was questioned by police in Keihin area. He has close relationship with Nolan, but their commanding hierarchy is not clear. One more important thing is, he is sneaked into Korean people too. He tries to make ideological disturbance, no doubt. We must follow him thoroughly. Master sergeant, Yokohama kenpei-taicho (chief MP) reported that this newspaper spread broadly within kakyo (overseas Chinese). This is same, the second version of Chongqing side. Koa Gakkan appeared too. This must be done by Oh Yuho. The school has been respectable since deceased Tsumura sensei established for the development of Asia. Yes sir. It started 2-3 months ago. The incidents against Japan began. Since Oh Yuho came in. Now, Shooting sir? We will investigate him completely. Contact the school. Prepare the Chief's gun. Thank you. Have you finished shooting? Yes sir. All of them finished. Chief, please have a look at this. Nolan did it again. This is American newspaper. This picture is quoted from Japan Kaiho of Nolan. See? Same. It suggests, men disappeared from Japan as shown this. They make good propaganda. Outrageous. There are more. Look. It reads "Japan has no leather for shoes, so people wearing sandals." They say Japan is financially defeated in long run. This was also appeared in the Nolan's magazine. That's why the Chongqing side can keep aggressive. Can't we do something for Nolan? If we can, I would do. But if we do nothing he will... Stop shooting. Why don't we rather, Sustain, sustain. Sooner or later the time to close will come. You didn't shoot well. You shoot with the tips of hand that's not good. Shoot with abdomen. Lieutenant Be patient for a while. The time will come. You did it. Let's do again. No, sir. Time to stop. Have you done the investigation? Estimated victims by the explosion of this water reservoir is 800,000. The whole area of factory zone will be destroyed. This summer a pharmaceutical factory in the upstream had a fire, carbolic acid flew into the river. You must remember the incident. that time we checked the area which was contaminated with smelling water, It was inside of this area as you see. Referring the newspapers etc., we found it clearly. You are clever. So, thank to the incident you found the distribution map of water. Lucky incident to us. It never occurred to them we could make use of the information. The newspapers splashed the information very well. It helped us a lot. So do you know the discharge channel? That is a problem. These days Japan is getting keen to counterintelligence It is not so easy as in old days. Don't be weepy. If it is the situation I have to think new approach in a way. When the war starts our army would attack the sky of Tokyo. If we don't know where to attack, it means our duty is not completed. You found the map of water distribution, you can find a solution. Do it. Immediately. Yes, sir. I never heard Mr. Holstein complaining. This job must be really tough. No, not big deal. The same incident can be happened here. Can be? We can make it happen. Look, a good factory is here in the upstream. Fuji Kogyo Kaisha Co. We can burn it. I see. Burn immediately. Interesting. I'm interested a little. Interest is nothing. Execute. Don't sit and admire. I ask you this job. Me? Yes, easy. You can order it to your good subordinate. While he is strolling, he can set a dynamite on the back of the factory. After that he can wait and watch in smoking. Good. I will take it. You must do it when the minimum possible people is at the factory. Maybe the first or the third Sunday. No, the eve of the day is best. Problem is that, recently the local civilian defense corps at factory are drilling on holiday. Even if the fire was set successfully, it will be put out by them in drilling. We have to check it first. Actually it is so easy. Fortunately it is aroma chemical factory, so they are trading with foreigners, if not, you can offer them you will publish the company on your magazine and go to visit them. This country of Japan is so naive that they will show it in public notice. Good. As soon as the day is determined I will carry out. Fortunately I have someone suitable for this. You mean, the Chinese man as you told? No, it is not Oh. What is he doing? He is doing well. This is a request from all of us. I hope sensei will understand our intention. We came Japan, and have been studying comfortably and satisfactorily, we love Japan and Japanese people loved us, but now, look, one single nonconformist disturbed our peace. Was there anyone in Koa Gakkan who was called by police? Seki was detained. Wait. Are you suggesting Seki is detained due to Oh? Yes sir. All the articles which Seki wrote on the school booklet was came from Oh. The newspaper Daio Manpo which Seki possessed was given by Oh. We burned them. That's not all. It must be Oh who spread the anti- Japan newspapers in Japan. Prosecute Oh and get back Seki. Seki! I came back sir. How about Nojima sensei? He is still staying at police. You returned alone? Where is Oh? He didn't come since yesterday. I will go Oh. Good. Me too. Let's go. I want to say him something. Wait. Seki-kun, did you tell police the name of Oh-kun? No sir. I can't betray a friend with whom I talked deep even if it was temporary. But in this situation I want him back China for him. Yes, we have to return Oh back China. Wait. We are considering more than you. We are holding staff meeting now. But sensei... I know your opinion... Important thing is now, don't be upset, Leave now and tell so to all others. You must leave quietly. Do not make a fuss. Sorry kept you waiting. How was it? Nojima sensei is staying at police station. What did the students say? That's the problem. The students insist Oh must go back China. Oh's hazardous speech and behavior are destroying the peace in the school. They say he is a disturbing element, isn't it? Yes. Excuse me. According to you remarks, it seems the whole responsibility is on me, sirs. No, we don't mean it. No sir. Please tell frankly. I made Oh-san to join this school. Not only that, I am taking care of him in daily life. If something wrong in Oh-san, I must take responsibility for that. Then, I ask you, Tsumura sensei. Have you ever noticed something suspicious as said by the students? I never noticed at all. I still believe this is misunderstanding. But, this is not as simple as you think. If so, I would do anything. If he is doing something wrong, I will make him stop it. Depending on the situation I ask him go back China. This might be beyond authority, but please allow me to handle this matter for a while. Please. What authority do you have to control my opinion? I can say or do freely. Shut your mouth. Your speech and behavior do not matter only you, but matter us all. Your disturbing speech destroys the trust of all. Go back China. Yes, that's better. Oh, listen again. The reason we came Japan is to study from Japan and stand up with Japan. However, you try to cast a dark shadow on our spirit every time. Dangerous. Dangerous to you. Dangerous? What dangerous? I did nothing. OK. I will tell you. It is you who spread a booklet which published this article against Japan. You are going to trap me. What? We advice you with favor. Go back China. Go back and watch the reality of China again. That is exactly what I have to say to you. What? Do you have something to say more? Please move away, sensei. He can't understand without blow. No, you shouldn't. I am in charge of him. No. You don't understand. Why? I knew Oh-san since childhood. I think I knew him better than you. No. No, you are deceived. Maybe so, but I believed him. Please do not smash the belief flatly. My father and brother believed China and devoted their lives for knowing China. I, the daughter of the father believe him, please you too believe him. Sensei, your words made us ashamed. You are Japanese. The Japanese said so, why should we Chinese fight each other? Please leave quietly tonight. Please. Please. I understand. If you are our compatriot, consider the words of sensei deeply. Sorry for bothering you, sensei. Excuse me. Kimiko-san. What's the matter? Nothing. Oh-san, I'm sorry. Can you keep believing me? I see. In the staff meeting today I defended you. If you feel sorry for me, please don't betray us. Kimiko-san, I will go back China. No, you shouldn't. If you do so, it's like run-away. Or, do you have any reason to run away? No. Nothing. Nothing at all. Do you have no reason really? Tell me. Nothing. Just, I worry you will be in trouble. This is the will of father and brother. And me. The will of three persons depends on you. I don't know. I don't know. What you don't know? My wish is simply that you know I believe you. Oh-san, telephone. From whom? Oh, Raul-san. What is it? I will be able to go back Philippines, at last. Please be pleased. I want to see you. OK. I will visit you. Then, see you later. Thank you very much for everything, Dr. As the saying, this disease will be cured when you back in hometown. You'd better go back. I will be able to see the blue sky of hometown in a decade. Good. When your mind is cheered up your body will be fine too. Thanks again for everything. Take care. Farewell. Raul-san, this, What's medicine? Nothing. Oh-san? He has been waiting. Sorry for asking you come. Congratulation. Your wish is fulfilled. Thank you. You are the second person who congratulated my returning. My doctor did too. Did he? But I feel lonely somehow. I leave Japan where I lived almost 10 years, nevertheless, only two persons share my happiness. It was disgusting job. Everything is in secret. Hidden, hidden, always. How about your wife? Yuri? I am thinking to leave her. I can't bring her with me. Impossible. You see? She doesn't know yet? No. For that issue, I asked you to come. I ask you about Yuri. After I left Japan, find a proper time, make her follow me. Do I do it? Yes. If things go well I am going to leave tomorrow. So suddenly? Actually it is not "leave" but "run-away". My return to dear hometown depends on one condition. I have to do the last, dangerous job before I leave Japan. This one. That is tonight. High-explosive? Don't ask me the details. In Japan I have no other person I can rely on. Please help Yuri. I have no choice of means. If my dream to return the south is fulfilled, that's all I can do. If Nolan gives me the return ticket and freedom, I'm willing to accept being his slave. No, Raul-san, I agree if you dare to take a risk for your own belief or passion but you are not. It's is meaningless risk. But without taking the risk, they do not allow me return. It shouldn't be. Nolan has no right to restrain your freedom. Raul, Why are you still here? I worry about my passport. You worry only your return. Do worry about your job. To me, your job to do is much important than your returning. I won't give you a passport unless you complete this job. I know sir. Then, go now. It's dark now. Oh-kun, good-bye. Oh-kun, What do you want? No, nothing. Why did you give him the dangerous job. Why? Did he tell you something? No. I pity him. In poor health, he longing for homecoming. Why don't you allow him return? He worked hard for you. You are sentimental always. Don't care someone's business. It's our business. We are comrades. Comrades. How nice. Was it your business? Nolan-san, I will return too. Return? Yes. Where to? I will return to China. To China? For what? I have to redefine many things. About you, about US, I need to consider again. For that reason you will go back? China is not American puppet. It should be independent nation in Asia. Where were you imbued with such idea? Do you know where your China is positioning? That's exactly you need redefinition. Look you Chongqing, the presence of Chiang Kai-shek is up to US. Even if you make redefinition, this fact cannot be changed. If so, why should I do this job under American? I will go back. Going back is up to you. But how can you get a return certificate? Think your situation. Japan will not easily give a return certificate to a spy. You depend on us. If you are in danger you can go to our embassy or consulate for asking safety. You must know it. Who would help you for this or that? International Law would never allow the Japanese military policemen to step in a place under the flag of Stars and Stripes. If you close this gate, what can you do? You see, Oh-san? You know it. Think it. When was it? About a week ago. Our factory makes aroma chemicals, so we are trading with foreign companies. Therefore many foreigners come in and out. The foreigner ask our employees earnestly the date of air-raid drill, the first Saturday or the third Saturday. Something strange. So what did you do sir? We had to do many things for year end, so we could not decide for a while. A couple of days ago we determined the third Saturday. However, for this suspicion, as well as the advice by police, we decided suddenly to do on the first Saturday too. Good. Remarkable decision. By now, they are in drill. We must go back. Thank you sir. We are most pleased to know that the counterintelligence is performed by the hands of citizens like this. Around the place of Fuji Kogyo Co., a suspicious man was found by civilian defense corps, but he escaped. Catch him. We do, sir. This was found the place. It seems high-explosives. Is this blood? Yes, said so. Keep it hot. You can go to sleep. Welcome back. You got soaked. You'd better brought an umbrella. What's the matter? Why don't you eat first? Soup is pottage. I added oyster. You didn't eat yet, did you? Your hand, blood! Don't touch. Sorry. It's nothing. Where to? Travel? To American Consulate. So late hour? I'm urgent. I need to get passport. I will fly to Manila tomorrow. Manila? Yuri, Yuri. We have to be apart for a while. Apart? You are kidding. What are you talking? I asked Oh-san about you. You will come after me soon. Where to? Manila. I don't want. No way. Listen Yuri, Our dream will be fulfilled. We can be happy. This is the money for a while. I see. You don't love me anymore. You are tired of living with me in Japan. Don't be silly. How could you say... Yes, I know it. I was stupid. Why didn't I realize this earlier? No, it is not. Then, what is it? What is this? Yuri, I will tell you the truth. I was a spy. I have been doing espionage in Japan for US. The stock market on radio too. These furniture, carpet, and this room, your dresses too, all of them I earned by the job. But you know nothing so, You are innocent. This is true. You are liar. Spy? You don't need to make such childish story. You can say, you don't like me. You are coward. You are coward. It is so sudden that I know you don't believe my story. I also hope it is a lie. You will see soon. This is Honmoku, kurimoto 30, Raul Zenarauca Are you Kaga-cho Police? Are you going to sell your husband? You said you are spy. You are spy. No. So, that are all lies, is it so? Lies? Yuri, Don't make me suffer. Raul, you fool. I love you forever. Get out! Get out! Yuri! Master, I will go to doctor. It's too late. Yuri, I won't go anywhere. He must be here by now. Yes, he will come. Wang cannot return without the certificate. He will come for this. I'm mad at him. He leaked it. No other person knew the plot last night. We cannot leave the matter. It would cause us trouble. We have been waiting. Your certificate is ready. Thank you. I heard Raul-san failed. You know very well. You are right. He killed himself. Pity. He was so eager to return. Indeed. You must return safely. This is not much but your reward. I can't take it. Going back China is all I needed. I see. You are great sir. Thanks for everything. You are welcome. I didn't expect this. What? You gave me the certificate so easily. Good-bye. John, escort him. Nolan-san, please. Mr. Wang, You are in good figure, aren't you? What are you going to do? Don't glare me so hard. Let's take a time for talking. How about a puff? I see. You don't like. Don't do rough. This is a habit of China. We are gentlemen. See, Oh-kun? You are gentlemen too. Surely you never betray us? Betray? That is, inform about Raul or outsmart us. I know nothing of that. Oh? You don't know? It is you who killed Raul. He was killed by you, killed by US. By America? You are playing innocent, but it was only you and I who knew the job of Raul. For good-bye present before returning China, you informed about Raul, and outsmarted us. Now tell me. Yes, I would tell. I will repeat again and again. By inveigling and threat, you sucked the blood of Chinese for long and make yourself full, Watching you evil figure, I realized clearly now the way that China should take since Sun Yat-sen. You did? But, it was a little bit late. Now, do as you like. Kill me if you want. Kill! Good readiness. Even if my body dies my soul appeals the whole Chinese for freedom of Asia. Great opinion. We must listen what you want to say. We will give him a feast. How is this? Have I done too much? No, don't mind. What is it? Come, This. Burn? What's this? What's the matter? Terrible situation. Everyone is detained and house-searched. We are informed by the embassy. What happened? They say your house is in search too. Did you burn all? John is doing. Prepare car. Where are all? They went to the embassy. To the embassy? Why? Miss, From Oh-san? It seems so, Oh-san. Kimiko-san. What... I... have done to you, What's the matter? So late hours. I wait you without locking. What? I can't hear, hello, hello. Speak louder. Thanks to you, I am reborn. I, I...you, What are you talking? What's the matter? So later hours. Don't drink too much. I told you always. You must come home now. Hello, hello, Oh-san, Chief, Takeda, is it all right sir? Yes, all right. Keep guard on outside. Yes sir, we keep on guard outside. Good. Hey, we must take care of our lives. I have my own reason. Hold it. Chief, I found this. This is a fine short wave radio. I let you listen good one. Please attention the urgent news, The army and navy announced on December 8th, 6 am, today 8th, before dawn, the Imperial Army and Navy entered a state of war against US forces in West Pacific Ocean. today 8th, before dawn, the Imperial Army and Navy entered a state of war against US forces in West Pacific Ocean. Look, Nolan. This time has come at last. The time we hundred million Japanese have long waited for. December 8th. Today, Japan stood up and commenced firing against the oppressive West. This is a good day for 100 million Japanese. But, listen Chief, I've been in this country for 20 years. Set down deep roots. Listen, Chief, have you ever heard this? Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces much grain. Who said that? Christ. Even if I die, the spy seeds remain. That's a remark of Ishikawa Goemon (big thief). It means, even if Jack Nolan dies, the spies are not yet dead. Thank you. As sour grapes, that's very meaningful. We have prepared ourselves for the long battle. END
