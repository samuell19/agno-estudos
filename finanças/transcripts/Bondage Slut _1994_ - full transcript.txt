Betty! - Oh, hi! - Betty! Hey, Betty, Betty! Are you okay? Is your name Betty? I think somebody's looking for you. I'm so sorry. Yeah, she's like having a new toddler. - Oh! - Here you go, girls. I'm Nina. Hi. Melody. These are mine too. This is Holly, and this is... I'm Ivy. They were wondering who bought this place. Uh, you mean who would be so crazy. It definitely takes a fixer-upper, of which I am not. Are you new to the area? Lifelong Wisconsinite, but this is my first time in Chippewa Falls. Oh, okay. Well, I hope you're taking on this giant project with family and friends. On my own. Wow. Is your car full of books? Yes, it is. Books are my travel companion. I'm never lonely when I have a book. And some of these I've had since before I was your age. - Are you a book lover too? - Yeah. I just got my master's in library science, so I could be a librarian. A kids' librarian. That's great, huh? We need you. Every branch we seem to go to seems to be short-staffed. Where are you gonna be working? Well, I had a job at Lakeview, but they had an unexpected hiring freeze, so I'm looking. But you know, I'd already signed the papers on the house, so... I'm happy to loan out anything you like. Betty, no! Betty! I thought getting a new puppy was a good idea. It was great meeting you. Right, Holl? It was great meeting you. Bye. Oh. Hi, I'm Melody Knapp. Here's my resume. - Hello, I'm Melody Knapp. - Hi. So I worked in local libraries as a teenager, got my master's at Madison. Whoa. You have a really impressive resume. Thanks! I've worked really hard. I wish. I'm sure you're a wonderful candidate. Graduating summa cum laude. We don't have the budget for another librarian here. The state's slashing budgets left and right. We are going through a hiring freeze right now. Thank you. Next, please. Do you know this book? Well, you're not gonna believe this, but that is one of my all-time favorite books. Me too. Do you have any more like it? I can read. Well, you're some kind of a rock star. Uh, I'm not in charge here, but, um... She's been racing through books. Oh, I know just the thing. I think you'll love this one. And it's part of a series. There's a lot more books to read. Oh, thank you so much. - Yeah. - Come on. Bye! I know you! Well, hi there! What a great surprise. Me and Holly are here, while my mom gets more puppy food. I'm looking for a dog princess book. Do you know any books like that? - Actually, you know what? - Holly, look who I found! Melody can help too. Melody the librarian. Like you! Uh, hi. I just moved here. I'm a graduate of Madison's library science program. Actually, I was hoping to talk to you about any job openings you might have. I'd be happy to start out as a library assistant, or if you need someone to run a kids' program. We just don't have the money. Right now all we can support are volunteers. Well, I have a master's degree. I'm looking for a job. Well, with that kind of a degree, you should look into data management or information technologies. - Yes, but... - That's how people are using their library science degrees these days. That's not my dream. I want to be where the kids are, where their love of reading and storytelling starts, and share the books that changed my life. I mean, without them, when I was a kid... What if I did a program I developed at school for free? If you liked it, you could pay me to do it after... two weeks? Melody's super fun. Her whole car is filled up with books. It's free help, Patricia, and it's Christmas. This coming Sunday at 11 A.M., you can do one sample holiday program, and then we'll see. Thank you. You won't regret it. Sometimes dreams just take a little time, that's all. Ed, I'm gonna need a lot more materials for this site. You know, you could take this to the chain in Eau Claire, who'd fix it faster. Faster is not better. Ed, we all know you're better. Okay. There's gonna be three restrooms per floor, with six stalls in each. Let me call my supplier, see what their timeline is. Yeah, I, I'm fond of that venetian bronze finish. Me too, but my budget's fond of satin finish chrome. You shouldn't let your budget overpower you. Says the man who's ordering 18 bathroom stalls a floor for how many floors? Didn't your parents teach you it's rude to eavesdrop? Well, I think the owner was the loud one. Shh! Ed has ears everywhere. Uh, indoor or outdoor? Because you want to make sure that you're protected from rust. And if you want a code... Outdoor, no code. I've got the borehole and backset measurements. I just don't see a single cylinder deadbolt. Okay, so I was just trying to mansplain, and you clearly know exactly what you're doing. I'm not sure "trying" to mansplain is the right word. Okay, you got me. Apologies, apologies. Um, if I may, satin nickel finish, single cylinder deadbolt. On sale today. Ah! Wait, do you work here? No, no, I'm just a contractor who's here 24/7. Is your house okay? You didn't get broken into, did you? My house is totally falling apart, but that's the way I bought it. Do you know Orchard Street? - No! No! - Yes. You're the one who bought 584. Okay, you must be very determined. - Or crazy or both. - Or both. Adam, I've got your numbers. Ed, this is... Uh, Melody Knapp. She bought the house on Orchard. Oh, well, I've got a feeling we're gonna be seeing a lot of each other. Thanks. Adam Yeager. Good luck to you. Uh, thank you, and thanks for this. Okay, let me show you what we got here. Adam. Dad, hey. What are you doing here? Councilwoman Richards and I are meeting for coffee. I am hoping for her final sign-off on the dealership expansion. The Westlake location? No, the one on Lorelai. It's a great opportunity for you to come run one from the ground up. I already have a job, Dad, which you know. Yes, but a family business... - Needs family, yes. - Right. Hey, tell Mom I'll meet her later at the benefit. - You bet. - Okay. Hey, you need a hand? Yes, please. Okay. Hey, girls. Wow. This is a beautiful tree. Thanks. There's a really terrific lot not too far from here, actually. Oh, yeah? I would love the address. Oh, are you okay? You all right? Yeah, yes. Yeah, I-I'm fine. I just... Crazy day at work. Both of the lawyers that I do paralegal work for are in court, and the next one's just about to be, and then we had the whole tree-finding experience, and Holly really wanted a very specific book, so... Of course, everywhere we went, they didn't... What book is it? Uh, Dixie Belden, the series that Holly really wants to read, but no one seems to know it. Uh, could it be Trixie Belden, the mystery series that started in the late 1940s, went up to the 80s? Yes? Guess what. I have one. - You're kidding. - No. - What? - I do. Come on. Trixie Belden and the Secret of the Mansion. You're like a bookmobile. Well, I am. Me and Susie, we, uh... Who's Susie? Susie is what I named my car. So here you go. All yours. Maybe I shouldn't borrow from someone I just met. Okay, well, then don't borrow it. Keep it. What are books for? For sharing. I mean, you want it, so it gets a new life, instead of just sitting in a box. Jingle bells Jingle bells Wow. Great turnout. Adam, our donation to Habitat for Humanity is gonna be the biggest yet. You ready to do our house? Only if I get to do the door. I do the door. You can do the roof. Uh, I would, if you didn't always eat all the gumdrops. I bought extra this year. Your father mentioned the Lorelai dealership? Again. He is not subtle. You can't be upset he wants to work with his only child. You know, you're not that subtle either. We just want to lay the right foundation for you. Speaking of, how goes business? Uh, the building on 24th is shaping up, we're breaking ground on a new house on Rampart, and... I just finished that side table for the Andersons. Adam... It's your fault. You just get me interested in gingerbread houses since I was six. Sure, blame it all on me. I will. But you know how I feel. You and Dad are super passionate about cars and giving back to the community. Help where help is needed. Always, but I... You know I love building things. - Actually, Mom... - Oh, wait. We're running low on gumballs. Look, I will try to talk to your father and get him to back off, but you keep pushing forward with the contracting business. Now's the time to capitalize on what's happening, not step back. And don't do the door. I'm coming back. I'm totally doing the door. I figured you probably didn't have your kitchen set up yet, but... actually, I don't even know if you cook. I do not cook at all. I am a very good reheater, and I hope someday to learn, so thank you. You're welcome. And same with us. I swear, we survive on the grace of takeout and on Ivy's baking skills. Your girls are fantastic. Oh, thank you. Yeah, they're pretty amazing. It was actually their suggestion that I bring this over. Oh, and... hold on... A Christmas card from Ivy. Oh, my gosh. And a huge thank you from Holly for the book. - That is so sweet. - Sure. Can you stay for some tea? I don't burn water, so far. - Here comes some tea. - That looks great. Listen, Holly is such an eager reader. I can't even tell you how grateful I am to have somebody who gets it just right next door. Books were my savior growing up. Oh. Are your parents big readers? I found it myself. What about you? Was law in your family? My mom was a legal secretary. Well, she must be proud of you. Actually, she passed away when I was in college, so... I'm so sorry, Nina. It's totally okay. Actually, she's the reason why I push myself so hard. Growing up, it was just the two of us, and she really did want what was best for me. It's funny. I usually don't talk about my mom. No one ever really asks. Well, you can talk to me. Right back at ya. Well, this was wonderful. Thank you. Next time, we'll do it at my house. A very special takeout. I would love that. And I'm sure I'll run into you again. Yes, you will because I know where you live. I'm fine. Drink it. You're all flushed. Is there somebody that I can call for you? No, really, I-I'm just... I've got a lot of my plate right now. I don't want you to worry. Well, you collapsed on my kitchen floor. I'm worried. Right. I used to have this lovely woman who helped me out about three afternoons a week in the neighborhood. But she moved away, so lately, it's just been me. It's just a lot. Well, let me help out with them. Seriously, I'm only working one day a week, if you can even call it that, and, well, the library may decide that I'm not worth it after Sunday anyway. And I've taken care of lots of kids. Don't worry. Nah, I just met you. I can't ask you to do that. You're not asking. I'm offering. Okay, but only if I can pay you. - Nnn... - You just got done telling me that you were looking for a job, right? So maybe you could do this, and it would allow you enough time to look for your dream job. I don't like being indebted. Good. I don't either. Maybe we could just be grateful to do this for each other. Yeah? I can do that. I love winter, huh? You have to to live in Wisconsin. Yeah. The cold weather forces you indoors. There's more face-to-face. Just feels like time moves a little bit slower, huh? Plus Christmas. Plus Christmas. Okay, so Wednesday after school, 3:00? Mm-hmm, you got it. And make a doctor's appointment. I'm serious. I want proof. - You're hardcore, huh? - Yeah, that's right. See ya. Now don't move. Okay. Festive. Betty, no! We make new ornaments each year. Do you make your own ornaments? You know what? I'll be right back. We're gonna need cinnamon sticks. - I know where to get those. - Yeah? How did you learn to do this stuff? Well, I didn't have a lot growing up, so I learned how to make my own things by checking out how-to books at the local library. You learned a lot to fix a whole house. Well, I still look at books, and I talk to people who do it. And later, I'm gonna go to Crock's Hardware Store. You are? - You know the place? - I love it. I have my own tools. Can we go with you? Sure. I've made a birdhouse and a toolbox, and I watch as many DIY videos online my mom lets me. There's one I'm going to make her for a Christmas present. Is that a new look? Doorknob girl. - Melody. - Melody! Is that glitter? I did it. It's a makeover. Oh, wow. You are some sort of professional. - No. - Are you sure? 'Cause I'm pretty sure that celebrities would hire you out. - Not yet. - Well, if you also decorate, I might have a job for you. - What do you think? - I'm seven. Right, right, so you should maybe ask your mom first. - That's not my mom. - It's not? - Can we go in? - Of course. - We'll meet you inside. - Okay. - How's the door? - Opens and closes. Success! And the rest of the house? Don't ask. More stuff for the office building? No. I drop off overages. Ed facilitates it getting in the hands of local builders doing pro bono work. And the boss drops it off himself. Impressive! I try to help where help is needed. I should get back to the girls. I look after my neighbor's kids a few times a week. - It was good seeing you. - Yeah. Do you like hot chocolate? Does anybody say no to that? No, no. Just if you're new in town, you should probably go down to Sycamore Street. They have great shops, and then there's this bakery that sells just the world's best hot chocolate, so you should probably... Would you wanna try it out with me? Well, I have to do some Christmas shopping, so could we combine the trip? Absolutely, yeah. Can you put your phone number in here for... - Yes, I can. - Here. - Here you go. - Yeah. - Okay. - Success. - Oh, look who's here. - Hey, guys. Mom, look what we made for decorating tonight. That's tonight? Plus our dance number. I'm sorry. Dance number? Dinner and tree trimming? And dance number, yes, please, you bet. All right, girls, come on. Craft clean-up time. This one will go here, and this one... - No, you can't. - I can do it. Mom! Store-bought brownies to spoil our dinner. Brownies! Best way to settle an argument. Just don't tell the dentist. Okay, now, that's amazing. Who's responsible for this? Ooh! Okay, does that mean it's dance time? Dance time! - Okay, okay. - Dance time! - Okay. - All right. Now I think I'll leave to you What to give the rest Choose for me, dear Santa Claus What you think is best Choose for me, dear Santa Claus What you think is best Whoo-hoo! Whoo! That was the best tree trimming I've ever been to, and my first with choreography. Yeah, when the girls were little, they were both drafted into a Christmas pageant. They both got assigned to be Christmas trees, but one of them was not too happy. - Ivy. - Mm-hmm. She's not very good at standing still. So to make it up to them, when we got home, I choreographed a little routine for them. Well, the routine has changed over the years. It used to have more break dancing and stuff like that, but as I get older, I have more pop than I do lock. That is amazing. You okay? - Did you... - No, I... I made the doctor's appointment. I just, uh... I already know what he's gonna say. I've beaten lymphoma twice in the past five years. Oh, Nina. But I've been clear for the last two. And the dizziness, the flush, the fatigue, it's, uh... it's the exact symptoms I get each time it comes back, so... What can I do? It's just... It's gonna be so hard on the girls if I have to fight another round. I don't even know if I should tell them. Let me watch them while you go to the doctor, okay? At the very least. And then anything you need, I'm here. Plus, I'm sure it's just all those things you said: stress, overworking. Yeah, I'm sure. Okay, well, they're probably working up an appetite. Would you mind grabbing plates? - Yeah. - Okay. A doll that has makeup you can put on and wash off, a real sled, and donuts. Donuts for Christmas? You can never have enough donuts. Amen. Holly, do you have a list? Holly has been asking for power tools. - Yeah? - Yeah. She's always doing these sort of do-it-yourself projects. Oh, Holly, tell Melody about the one... Oh, no, it's okay. She doesn't have to. - How is it? - I finished it. Already? Wow. I love how Trixie thinks she's gonna have a horrible season, - and then... - Then she finds a friend. Someone she can be herself with and learn new things from. Mm-hmm. I have more books from the series at my house. Do you want to come grab one? Okay, come on. Welcome. Wow. People live like this? Well, not for long, hopefully. Where'd you get all these? I sort of collected them throughout the years. Hey, you want to see some of the things I've been working on? Okay, come with me. So I painted this wall last night. It might still be wet. Be careful. But... I think I'm proudest of this. This is my vision board. Do you know what that is? It's a way to put what you wish out into the world. To visualize it. Do you have wishes? You know, I haven't had the easiest life, and sometimes things can be tough. So if there was ever anything that you needed to say out loud, I'm a really good listener. But that's what moms are for. And my mom's a really good listener. The best. Hey, your mom gave me the address to your tree lots, so maybe you could come help me pick one out next time I come over. We could decorate another tree? Yeah. Why do you want a cat? Dogs are so much better than cats. We can argue about that some other time. Let's go get you that book. - Favorite tradition? - Building a snowman! Who's got a crazy one? Making Santa beards. Oh! We spray shaving cream on our chins, without mirrors, and then have a contest to see whose is best. Oh, that is my vote for favorite tradition. Anyone agree? Yeah? Okay. So everyone made two snowflakes. One goes home. And the other one, do you know where it goes? I'm gonna take it to decorate the rooms of kids at the hospital. They can have both of mine. Thank you, Ivy. That's so sweet. I like these drawings. Parents said they'd tell their friends. Maybe more kids will come next time. And more kids means more attendance, which would help, right? It's more complicated. Costs keep going up. Materials, technology, maintenance. Families depend on us. Everything you just said is exactly why I wanted this job. What if I keep volunteering with kids about to be out of school for Christmas vacation? I could be open to that. Mmm! - Yes, right? - So good. There's just, there's so much more that they could do. The library has meeting rooms, so organizations that need space could rent it out. Patricia mentioned technology, so they could offer classes. Or kids could teach grandparents. And if we can revive this library, it could be a model for others in the area. - You really love it. - I do. And you weren't kidding about this hot chocolate. - It is the world's best. - I know. I should've gotten the large, like you said. How's the remodel going? I knew what I was taking on, or I thought I did. But I'm low on money and resources, so I'm obviously going to live out my days without walls or reliable electrical. You know that I could take a look at it. Oh, no. It's not fit for company. I will be gentle. You'd mock or close the door and run away with the look of horror on your face. I would scoff at first and then run away. But seriously, I'm happy to offer a professional opinion. No judgment. Scout's honor. Were you really a scout? Actually, yes, I was. Wow. This is awful. - You promised. - I'm kidding! I'm kidding. This is, actually has incredible bones. Wow. You don't you don't see craftsmanship like this anymore. - You see that? - Yeah. Whew! Well, this built-in is really well put together. Thanks. Wait. You did that? From scratch. Yourself? I'm doing the whole thing myself. You didn't ask anybody for help. Well, I know like three people in town. Uh, four, if you include me. Well, we don't know each other that well. Well, you know, I'm working on it. So how did you pick up construction? Hmm, what is that phrase? "Necessity is the mother of invention." I had a lot of time on my hands growing up, and there were great books out there. Books again. The books! Yes. Well, you know, I could, um... I could build you a window seat. You build furniture? Ah, yes, it is my hobby. Actually, no, no, it's... it's... my overwhelming passion and like the thing that I would do 24/7 if only I wasn't already busy building my contracting business. Well, wait, I mean, if you love making furniture, then why are you building a contracting business? So I won't be some struggling artisan working out of my garage. Well, you should follow your heart and do what's best for you. You haven't met my parents. You could do corporate work and save up until it's not just in your garage and then make a go of it. - That sounds, um... - Great, right? I worked the entire time I was in school, just to build a nest egg, to make sure I could try to be a librarian. Yes, but you have more energy than most humans. If you're interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it full speed ahead, embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it, and above all, become passionate. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be. That's Roald Dahl. - The kids' book guy. - Uh-huh. Wow. That quote. You're quoting the... Hey, kids' book authors are geniuses. I could quote you 50 more funny and inspiring quotes from... Okay, I'm going on about books again, aren't I? I kind of like it. Look, you could do what I'm doing. We could be broke together, living our dreams. Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't... Do you want to maybe quote me some more kids' books over another date? You know, just for inspiration? It's gonna snow this weekend. I-I, um... I make sleds. Would you want to... Sorry, you make sleds? Could you teach me? No, better yet. Could you come to the library on Sunday and teach the kids how to make them? And not just like a whole one, but, you know, like ornament-sized. Yeah, I could... I could do that. But then after... Another date. Look, Melody, they have elves just like you. Yeah. Are all your ornaments elves? Well, my five favorites are, but I've got like three dozen others. Is that a problem? Uh, it's a little weird. Well, why fit in when you were born to stand out? - Dr. Seuss said that. - Yes. Do your favorites have names? Mm-hmm. Dasher, Dancer, Blitzen, Mickey, and my favorite, Huckleberry. That's the one. That's your tree. I think you're right. Rockin' around the Christmas tree At the Christmas party hop Mistletoe hung where you can see Every couple tries to stop Go, Betty! Rockin' around the Christmas tree Wanna teach me the dance? Ready? 5, 6, 7, 8. Later we'll have some pumpkin pie And we'll do some caroling Up high, that's right. You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear Voices singing Let's be jolly Deck the halls with boughs of holly Rockin' around the Christmas tree - Can I ask you something? - Hmm. What's with the elves? They seem kind of important. I was surrendered right before Christmas and put into foster care, and my birth mom tucked an elf into my belongings. It's pretty old, so I just, I always imagined that it was hers when she was younger. In the first five years of my life, I was cared for by this amazing couple. They had taken in dozens of kids in their lifetime, and I was the last. But when I was five, the dad lost his job, and so they couldn't afford to keep me, and I was put back in the system, and I just never found a family like that again. I'm so sorry. Every year, they would give me a new elf to hang on the tree, something that was just mine. Five elves for five years. Plus, elves are the hardest workers in the Christmas story, and I just, I always identified with them. I may not have had all the breaks, but I'm a really hard worker. I didn't mean to upset you. - No, no. - I turned out okay, you know? Picked myself up, got an education, scholarships. Yeah. You know, there was this one librarian... Ah, a librarian. Who changed everything for me. She's the reason for all of this, why I landed on my feet. Don't be sad. I'm not. You are an inspiration. I just, uh... I'm worried that my girls are gonna end up in the system. I'm sorry. Just... my parents are both gone, and the father's not really an option. I got my test results finally. The lymphoma is back. It's fine. I just... If I can't beat it this time, I don't know what's gonna happen to my kids. Ooh! Ooh! I would take them. I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. That's ridiculous, and it's completely presumptuous. I mean, you obviously have people that... No, I-I don't. That's why I'm so afraid. I mean, we don't even... I adore you and the girls. We feel the same exact way about you. Yeah, but we don't even... We hardly know each other. No, I-I know. Look, this was just... This whole thing is just crazy. I'm going to pretend we never brought it up. And you're gonna fight this, and you're gonna beat it just like all the other times. But... I mean... Would you... be interested? No, you were just... You weren't thinking when you... No, I wasn't, but... I mean, what, you're 25? 27. And you're just starting your whole life. I don't even have a home that's safe, much less a job. But... But... I mean, maybe we could just talk to someone, get some information. I do work for lawyers. I could talk to them and maybe they could recommend someone for us to talk to. If it was the difference between your girls having a real home or being put into foster care, I would do that. I could never let a kid go through what I went through, not if I could help it. I'll make a call. Okay. I'd better start looking for a job. A giving tree. Everyone brings coats or hats and scarves to hang as ornaments. And then on Christmas Eve, we give them away to communities that need warm clothes for the winter. - And we do book adoptions. - Book adoptions? Either we have a wish list of books to fill the library with, to put online for people to purchase with book plates inside with the adopter's name on it. Or kids get to make their own wish list, and patrons of the library fill it, then we have a big giveaway day, maybe with the hats and the coats and the scarves. Oh, we could have some hot cocoa, maybe bring in a Santa. Ah. One more. I had this idea called "elf school." Teach kids how to secretly help people in their communities. Melody, I'm going to think about all these ideas. Thank you. Oh. - Adam. - Hey, how's your day going? Right now? Terrific. Otherwise... You want to talk about it at dinner? Didn't we say Sunday? Sunday is, uh, too far away. You know, there's a new place that opened up right near my construction site, and a Christmas concert in the park that's right next to it afterwards. - So I mean, I thought... - Yes. Okay. You want to meet me at my construction site at 6:30? I'm gonna text you the address. Okay, see you then. Okay, bye. Hmm? - I have a phone number for you. - Dad, hi. Charlie Case, Director of Urban Planning. The mayor has put Charlie in charge of the new charter school on Elm. Your firm is about to go to the top of the bid list. Dad, I have way more work than I can handle right now. One city contract opens up a host of doors. - You could expand. - Expand. Your mother and I knew the second it was time to open a second dealership. If I expand, I'm not gonna have any time left for my furniture. Oh, not that hobby again. - Adam... - Dad, Dad, listen me. I've been selling pieces, okay? Not just to friends and family. Like I'm building up a decent nest egg. In fact, I was thinking that I might scale back. - Scale back? - Yeah. So you can sell another chair here and there? You run a business. You're a salesman. Listen, if you would just come and see my shop... You mean your garage. It's great you have a way to make money on the side, but don't let that distract you from a real job. You don't want to sell cars? Okay. I've tried to make peace with that. But you have the beginnings of a real business here. Do you know what your mother and I would have given to have our first dealership take off like this? Why would you throw that away? We just want what's best for you. I know. Okay. Director of Urban Planning. Charlie Case. And don't forget to mention you're my son. And get that bid in before Christmas, so you don't lose out to somebody before the New Year. Sure thing. Thank you so much for meeting with me. Nina said that you might be able to help me. So sad to hear about Nina's recurrence. I don't know if she mentioned, but the process is pretty involved. I think that's why she referred me. Neither of us really knows that much. Here's the issue. Because you're not related by blood or marriage to Holly and Ivy, and because the children have never been in your custody, the state will have to weigh in about your fitness to be their guardian. There'll be a background check, an investigation. The children may be appointed their own attorney, and if they have access to assets, your financial fitness will be evaluated too. Here. It all needs to be filled out, and it's not a short process, so if you want to have everything in place if Nina... I'd just get started as soon as possible. This is a giant thing you've offered to do, and you need to decide if it's right for your life too. The state will go through your whole life, even your house, to make sure it's safe to be a home for two minors. My house? There she is. Hi. Is that her? Are you her? Um, am I? Brian, this is Melody. Melody, Brian. - Hey, it's her! - Okay. Are you ready to go? 'Cause I'm starving. Bye! We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year Good tidings we bring to you and your kin You know, it's possible I might need the world's biggest favor. I know it's insane, but if I can't get the house up to code, then I can't do any of it. And if Nina is very sick, then I have to do it fast. And, um, I just figured you might know some shortcuts to help get me up to speed. - Hmm. - I know. It's a lot, and I'm sorry. - Oh, it's a lot, a lot. - Yeah. I mean, are you sure that this is the right thing for you? Well, yeah. I mean, if Nina doesn't have anybody else, how could I not step up? I adore those girls. And so what if I don't want to get a sensible job right now? It's the right way to go for now. Wait, what? I mean, if one of those data management places or academic firms, you know, want somebody like me, then I could bank the money now and redo the house and chase my dream later. Right, but you said that you worked and you saved already, so that you could be a librarian. Yeah, but now everything has changed. Right, but I mean what about all the Roald Dahl stuff? Like you're just gonna take a day job and give up on what you want? Like, well, was that just words? I don't... No. I meant everything that I said. I'm sorry. I don't understand. Are you mad at me for trying to help the girls? No, no, of course you should help. Help where help is needed, not just when it's easy, right? Yeah. Yeah, I just, I... What? I do know some shortcuts, uh, sure. So I can send you some website links. And yeah, no, I really, I do get it, you know? I'm probably gonna put in for this big city job myself. There's no telling how much work I might have lined up. Might even expand. Wait, expand? What about your furniture building? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's like your library dream. Gonna have to wait. Oh, you know, listen, I got a head's-up at the restaurant that we're gonna get a bad inspection report, and it's gonna take me all night to fix it. Can I get a rain check on the concert? Sure. I'll walk you to your car. No, it's okay. I think I'll stay. All right. Hark, the herald angels sing Glory to the newborn king Peace on Earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled Joyful all ye nations rise Join the triumph of the skies Melody! Patricia, hi. Aren't the musicians wonderful? They're my grandkids. I was gonna call you tomorrow. - Do you have a moment? - Yeah. We heard from our director. The city's cutting back our hours again. We'll be closed on Sundays now, so I'm afraid we're not going to be able to keep you on. It's not that I haven't enjoyed what you've brought to the library. I think you've made a wonderful addition. We just don't have a place for you right now. I'm sorry. Is this Charlie Case? Hi. Yeah, this is, uh, Adam. Warren Yeager's son. He's... That's right. Yeah, yeah, I've always told him that he's a very good press agent. Listen, I would love to hear about the project that you're accepting bids on. Is it an okay time to... Uh-huh. That sounds great. I'm sure that I could put a bid together before everybody bugs out for Christmas. We have the Mommy-and-Me person in the morning, Saturdays are filled with technologies, afternoons are homework helpers, and I can't push out the grandparent readers. Can we sell it as an experiment? Our director thinks that people come to libraries for the tried and true. But tried and true isn't working. I know. I've come to love your ideas, but this is how it is. I'm sorry. Okay. Thank you. Hi. Can I get a hot chocolate and a donut, please? - Hi. This is Melody. - Hi. This is Kimberly Dade at Westminster Data Management. You submitted your resume online. - Oh, yes, hi. - Your background in education seems like the right fit for a job we have open. Are you available for an interview tomorrow? - Tomorrow? - I know it's fast, but the woman we had went on maternity leave two months earlier than we expected. I can give you all the information. Yes, um, just... You know what? Let me get to my car. I don't think I have a pen. Okay, found a pen, so... I'm so glad we could catch up here. They have the best hot chocolate in literally in the world. I'll be right back. Just give me one second. Are you still there? Yeah, sorry, I'm here. So 45 Augusta Street. Okay, I think I got it all. I'll see you tomorrow at 10 A.M. Thank you. Hey. Hi. Oh, yeah, it's... The woman I was with... Oh, you don't have to explain anything. I mean, you're free to do whatever. She's just the Director of Urban Planning. It's a potential client. Well, like I said, you could do whatever, you know. We didn't have anything that was... We did. We should probably talk about what happened the other night. Okay. What happened? I freaked out, and I left you hanging, so I am sorry. So, the Director of Urban Planning? Oh, yeah, uh, she's my dad's contact. I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me, so I who am I to turn it down, right? I get it. They just want what's best for you. Good luck with the client. - Dogs are friendlier. - Kittens are easier. Puppies are cuter. Than kittens? Have you seen Betty? One exception. No, seriously, has anyone seen Betty? Betty! See? Puppies are harder. But neater! Cats don't cause trouble. These would be good guest rooms. Maybe me and Holly could sleep over, wave between rooms. Hi! Hey, if you two could choose a color for a bedroom, what would you choose? - Light blue. - Pink! Kayla! Wow. My grandma would love it. She can't drive, but she loves to read. Can we drive to Kayla's grandmother's? Yeah. Let me text Kayla's mom and find out. This one's if you like romance. That one if you like mysteries. Yes. We brought you thrillers, true crime, history, biographies. We didn't know what you'd like. Oh, you have no idea what this means. I have friends who don't get around so well anymore, or they don't drive like me, who are gonna be so jealous. Or we could deliver to them too, couldn't we? Kid, you are some kind of genius. What? I think I just had an idea. Sleep in heavenly Sleep in heavenly Sleep in heavenly peace And there isn't a bookmobile in the whole area. And a library on wheels could serve all kinds of places. Not just individual homes, but nursing homes, shelters, schools, and in lower-income neighborhoods, rural families, people without Internet. That sounds amazing. Yeah, but is it crazy? No. I mean, first you have to think about your Wagoneer. Is it gonna hold up? You'll be driving it all over. Maybe I could get the library system to underwrite repairs or get a grant from the state for an actual van or... I don't know, find some big philanthropist who loves books. Bigger things have started in smaller ways. I think it's a really creative way to pursue your dream of being a librarian. Uh, you got a text. Oh. Is everything okay? Melody, what is it? They've set my home inspection. December 28th. Things just got really real, didn't they? It's just precautionary. Have they figured out a treatment? I mean, is it... Is it bad? I mean, it's... It's aggressive. But listen, I do not want you to be my nursemaid. You did not sign up for that. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't. Yes, I did. I am your friend. I'm the person that you asked to be your children's guardian. Yeah, but I'm just now realizing how big this is to take on. When I was your age, the biggest thing I was worried about was whether to spend New Year's Eve in Colorado or Vermont. Well, which one did you choose? Vegas. I think I, I danced on one of those neon signs. Oh, I could see Ivy doing that. Yeah, me too. It's funny. My girls both have different sides of me. The best parts. Yeah. I'm glad they have each other. Always. I am not gonna back out. I'm saying it's okay if you do. Nina, do you know why I bought that house next door? A house that's so much bigger than I could ever need? Because I wanted to fill it with people. I thought that if I could just put it out into the universe, like my vision board, that it might actually happen for me. I mean, I didn't think it would happen so fast, but there will always be room for anyone to be called family. Anyone. I mean, that's all I ever wanted. Thank you. Oh, look at the time. It's... How'd it get to be past 12 already? - I have to get up in six hours. - I have that interview. Are you sure you want to do that interview? Especially when you're getting your bookmobile off the ground. Yeah, yeah. At first, I thought a job like that would be a compromise, but, you know, it's only six months. I could save up, get the whole thing up and running. I mean, maybe it's a blessing. Maybe it is. The night has been full of them. Yeah. Wait, Diana was the woman who left on maternity leave? Mm-hmm. 5'6", dark hair, went to Madison? Two years ahead of you. She remembered you coming to the program. She was fantastic. She said the same about you, right as she was leaving for the hospital and heard your resume came in. - How is she doing? - Mother and baby are fine, but she's gonna need a little extra time, so you'd be filling in for about six months. You'd have to start right after the holiday. The timing is perfect for me. We'll have you come in between now and then for orientation and training, but you can schedule that around other commitments. I can do that too, so... So welcome aboard? If that is an offer, then yes, I will take the job. Takeout on me tonight, Nina. Yes, I start next Monday. Yeah. Finished it last night. Background check, copies of my financial records, information on my new job, and I confirmed my home inspection for the 28th of December. Great. We'll get it all filed. And I'll be in building mode every second until then. The smoke alarms need hard wiring. I've got the GFCis for the bathroom and kitchen electrical outlets. Um... I'd do the laundry room and the garage too, the kids are gonna be there. Okay. I can recommend a licensed electrician. And the city, they're gonna want to see your air conditioning ductwork is sealed. Okay, no central air. That's one thing that'll save me time and money. I know people that can do this kind of work, including Adam Yeager. I'm okay. You know the inspection's in five days. I don't have the budget for anyone other than that electrician. Besides, Adam's not interested in some falling-down house that might be home to an overnight family. He's got a business of his own that he's building. He's building that business, so he won't let his father down. Warren Yeager. Yeah, he's hard to disappoint, if you know what I mean. To the best team in Wisconsin. Now go eat. Ah, my boy. I didn't think you'd show up. What, and miss all this? Let me walk you around. Yeah, actually, I just stopped by to tell you... I put in the bid for that city job. Hey! Catherine! Adam has put in for the city job. Let's take him someplace special for dinner tonight to celebrate. Let's do it up. You okay? Sure. We only want what's best for you. Uh, you know, actually, can you tell Dad that I can't make it to dinner? What? You just got here. Another time. I'll see you later, Mom. - Hi. - Hey. So there's fresh coat of snow. You still wanna go sledding? I do happen to know the best hill in town. You didn't have to come. I wanted to. Look, you moved on. It's okay. I didn't. Melody... Look, Nina's waiting on tests. I could become the guardian of two girls soon, and you didn't sign up for an instant family with a girl that you don't even know if you like. - I get it. - I do know. I like you. Listen, I didn't back out that night because of the promise you made to Nina. I mean, the truth is, I couldn't imagine how anyone could take on an entire family that wasn't her own and just throw away her life plan until I realized that that's exactly what you asked me to do on our first date. You know, to chase my passion. And I didn't do that because... I don't have your guts. That's not true. No. I lucked out in life. I did. And I didn't realize how much until I met you. And yeah, the whole instant family thing is super daunting, but when I'm with you, all I know is that I am the most myself, and I am clear about what I want. And I don't want to own a car lot, and I don't want to plan anything urban. I just... I want to go sledding with you. That's all. So what do you say? I'll get my boots. House is really coming together. Do you want any help? No, I'm good. Aren't you on like a tight deadline? We could work after sledding. No. Seriously, it's fine. Got it. Why don't you like to accept help? - What? I do. - When? You help people all the time. When do you let other people help you? The way I grew up, asking for help never got you anything. Okay, fine. Don't ask. I'll just offer. You know, Holly, the older girl, she likes to learn about construction, so do you want to maybe knock on Nina's door and see if they want to come sledding, and then after you could show Holly some construction things? Hmm. I do have two sleds. Just hear those sleigh bells jingling Ring-ting-tingling too Come on, it's lovely weather For a sleigh ride together with you Outside the snow is falling And friends are calling yoo-hoo Come on, it's lovely weather For a sleigh ride together with you Giddy-up, giddy-up Giddy-up, it's grand Just holding your hand This time, we'll go without him. Hey, maybe when we're done, we can all go back to my wood shop and make something for Melody's house. - Hey. - Hi. - Look. - I know. He's cute. And he's really great with the girls. I know. I think so too. Yeah. Mom, do you want a turn? Uh, not today, honey, but have fun. You all right? Do you want to go home? Never! You kidding? I'm having way too much fun. It's gonna blow your mind. All right. This is the best place ever. This is amazing. Are these sleds for babies? No. I was gonna teach some kids at the library how to make them, so I was practicing. You can put some twine on them and hang them as an ornament. Hey, who wants to make some shelves for Melody's house? Yeah, you do. Only if there's glitter. Okay, all right. - Can you cut it? - Yeah. - Adam. - Wha... Dad, wh... Girls, it's getting kinda late. Maybe we should get going. - Yeah, it's been a long day. - What about the shelves? You guys can come back and finish them tomorrow. So what's going on here? Dad, these are my friends. This is Nina and her daughters, Holly and Ivy. - And this, um, is Melody. - Hi. Adam's teaching us how to build Melody's house. - To build her... - No, not build. I have some projects, and... - So you're contracting. - No, I'm just helping. Adam had shelves for Melody here in his workshop, - so we came here. - Oh. - Let's go, girls. - Okay. Okay. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. Bye. Adam, this is beautiful. I had no idea. - Thank you. - It is hot. Yeah, Melody's house needs to be ready for the inspection in five days, so that the proceedings can move forward in case the worst happens. It's a big commitment she's making, for somebody so young. Yeah, well, you know, she was a foster kid. She couldn't bear to see those kids taken into the system. It's the Christmas spirit in a nutshell, you know, making your house a home and your car into a bookmobile. The Wagoneer out there? Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's very determined. You like her. Huh. - I like all of them. - Hmm. Hey, you never told me why you came to see me. Uh... I came to see your workshop. Merry Christmas-Eve Eve, kiddo. Thanks, Dad. "He puzzled and puzzled until his puzzler was sore," then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before. 'Maybe Christmas, ' he thought, 'doesn't come from a store. "Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more.'" - I love Dr. Seuss. - Me too You can have my book. Books are for sharing. You did that. Dr. Seuss did that. "And what happened then?" Well, in Whoville, they say that the Grinch's small heart "grew three sizes that day." Melody, before you go, I got you something. For me? Why? You had a family once that meant something to you, and that's where those elves came from. I wanted you to know that you have another one here that you mean the world to. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm not sure that's supposed to be my reaction. It's okay. You moving next door was the best thing that ever happened to us, and I hope you know. For me too. Melody! Time to wake up! Surprise! Uh, it is customary for a man to call first, let a girl get dressed. Well, that would ruin the surprise. Okay, help me out here. What is happening? If you're gonna get your house up to code before the 28th, you're gonna need some help. Okay. So my crew and I, we have Christmas Eve off, so we decided that we would be your present and help you get your house up to code before the deadline. And then I mentioned it to a few other people and, uh... So go get dressed and leave and then come back at the end of the day. No. This isn't some makeover show, where the family leaves and then you yell, "Surprise!" and they come back. No, this is my house, and I have the chops to work on it, so I will get dressed, but then I'm breaking out my hammer and my nails. Okay, you heard the lady. Everybody, come on. All right! You better watch out You better not cry You better not pout I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town He's making a list and checking it twice He's gonna find out... Okay, start picking wall colors. You're our designer, right? I really like pink. You're really good with them, you know that? I had good parents. It shows. It does. Thank you. But I wouldn't leave Ivy alone with that tablet. - Oh, yep. - Yeah. All right, okay, okay. What do you think? Yeah, okay. I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming... - Careful. - Ready? - Easy, easy. - Almost, almost. Watch your toes! - Good job. - Okay. Can we bring over Betty? No, not to a construction site. Plus, I'm more of a cat person. What'd you just say? Uh, yeah, I'm a cat person. I have a pair at home, Hickory and Dickory. Hey, I have a special project. Just you and me. You in, kiddo? Okay. I heard that they need you in the kitchen, so can you just get out of here? Okay, grab that side. - We can do this. - Here you go. Thank you. So how you doing? You seem a little bit overwhelmed. Oh, it's just, it's weird. I spent my whole life accepting that I would do it alone, without ever expecting help. And then you moved to Chippewa Falls. Then people show up, open their hearts, offer to help. Elves. You have elves in your home. I do! I have Santa's elves! The Book Elf. That's what I'll call my bookmobile. "The elf that brings a book to your shelf." Oh, that's perfect. - Really? - I love it, yeah. I like it too. Santa Claus is coming To town - Okay, okay. - Okay. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. Adam... It is 100% safe and 100% up to code before the 28th. Oh, my gosh. See that? Oh, this is the best Christmas present I've ever gotten. I mean, you... You've all just changed my life. Actually, there is one more present. - What? - Mm-hmm. What? For reading books. I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay you for this. You offered an incredible gift to others. Someone needed to do that for you. No payment necessary. Thank you. - Hello! - Hmm? Dad, hi. Mom! - Hey, what, uh... - Is it gift-giving time? Hi. This is... You know my dad. This is my mom, Catherine. Hi. Our family has a tradition of opening one present on Christmas Eve, so we brought you a present. Who, me? Is this something else? No, I am as clueless as you are. Grab coats. It's cold out. - Okay. - Okay, let's go. So Adam told us what you were trying to put together, and that you were gonna make a bookmobile out of a '90s Wagoneer? Uh, to start, anyway. We thought you should think bigger, maybe with a fully equipped Sprinter van. What? Donated by a local dealership. No, no. I... I could not possibly accept this. It's... No, no, of course you can. Help where help is needed, right? I bet you didn't think you had a whole community ready to step up. It's too much. Take a look inside. This is amazing. Maybe you could outfit it with benches or shelves or some of your other incredible work. It could be a showcase for your new business. Custom woodwork. What are you... We spent a long time pushing you because we wanted you to be practical, and we knew you were such a gifted salesman, but what we forgot was salespeople work best when they sell what they love. And you love building beautiful things. Which you're already successful at. How can we stand in the way? I-I don't understand. I mean, why would you do this? We hardly know each other. We don't, but we know our son, and you have inspired him. My parents have suggested that I build some custom benches and shelves for your books and for your visitors, start to expand my woodworking business. So I'll do some data management... And I'll do some corporate construction... - Until both of our passions... - Get off the ground. Because sometimes dreams take a little time. But sometimes Christmas gives them a little extra push. Knapp-Larson family, follow me. Okay. That Christmas was the best one of my life, the first with a family I knew would be a part of my life forever. All right, here we go. One... - Hurry! - Two... Three! Nina fought so hard, but she passed before summer, and I became the girls' guardian. And now with Your Honor's approval, I'm petitioning to adopt Holly and Ivy permanently. Is this what you want? Yes, Your Honor. Is there anything you want to add? We loved our mom so much, and we miss her every day, but Melody made a home for us, and she's our family too. She's our family now. The adoption of Holly and Ivy Larson by Melody Knapp is approved. Betty! - Betty! - Betty? - Hi. - Aw... We get to open one on Christmas Eve. This one's for you. Me? Okay. You guys... - I built the frame myself. - And I decorated it. It's amazing, you guys. I love it. Thank you. Hey. I might have an early Christmas present too tonight. What do you think? Yeah? Okay. A toast? Cool. Your mom may not be here in all the ways that we wanted, but she's here in every other way possible because she taught me about love... and family... and giving and accepting help where it's needed. And I'm gonna do my best to carry that forward with me, everything she shared with me. To Nina. - To Nina. - To Mom! Mmm! And now... we dance. 5, 6, 7, 8!
