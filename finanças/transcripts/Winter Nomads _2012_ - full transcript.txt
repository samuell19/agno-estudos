Come! Turca! Look at that... Come here, Paquerette. Hey, donkeys! The holidays are over! Wait. Come here! WINTER NOMADS Down, dogs. Down, I said. No, you stay here. Where are you going? Dogs! You stay calm! Where are the trousers, Carole? Here you are! Titus! Heel! There's excitement in the air. - Got put their bells on. - Yes. - Did you find any shoe grease? - No. - What about these cyclosprays? - Take them both. They're for the sheep's hooves. What about the kettle? - Don't forget the boots. - We need another strap. - Let's fix it like that. - We'll see. That won't work. The noise will scare him. But... there's still enough room in these bags. Look. Is the load is well balanced? Not too bad. Hey, Irmate! Come. - Let's go, Carole! - I'm coming. Kiwi! Heel! Hey! Not so fast! Come here! Heel! He really has to slow down. Oh no! He's not going to drive through the flock. He's crazy. Look at that! And why not run over the sheep! I don't believe it. Stop! - Hi, boss. - Hello. - What weather! - We're in a mess! Are the animals ok? It normally starts snowing in December... What's going on? - Which way shall I take? - We'll go and have a look. - More tea, Pascal? - No, I'll go and check out the grass. Left or right? - Come back quickly. - You're ok here. - And? - We'll stick to the road. Sorry, Titus, but that's the way it is! Hey, Irmate! Figaro, ho! Carole, don't make them run too much. Come, Irmate! That's it! Good! - How far will we go exactly? - Up to Sermuz to get that facelia. Titus, heel! Hey, Milien! Milien, where are you going?! Figaro! Hey, there's nothing, come here! But in God's name, where's he going? Figaro! Stop! No, but really... Stop! Out of your mind? Come here! Heel! Tutsi! Heel! Where are you off to? Come, Irmate! Move this way! Oh my God! All this snow! I hope there's no problem? Is the ring on your side? I have the loop. I'm asking you if the ring is on your side? - Well, we lost the ring! - We lost the ring? - Where are they going?! - Oh dear! - We're not going to do anything! - We'll just leave them? We have to find it! It's going to be hell if we don't! - Hello! - Hello, Sir! Not very nice weather, is it! I thought you were going to offer me some grass. Oh, well... That's not so good for them...! - There's nothing else. - Yes, that's quite clear. When you have no choice, you take what you've got. You don't have a ring by any chance? I've just lost mine! - Maybe you have one at home? - I don't know. I could have a look. What's it for? We've just lost ours... No, here it is! Luck's on my side! Good! Because losing equipment makes life difficult. So what now? You see that small clearing? I'll check it out. - Come, Carole! - Shall I? You sure? What about the sheep? They're following me. Never mind. We'll take the pruning knife and start here. Here you are! Remove the snow a bit with your foot. So he can be with his mom. Oh, Leon! Who's that? Where's he sprung from? He hasn't sucked at his mother's breast for a while. - That's where our bed will be? - Yes. I'm holding it! Ok, that's fine. Don't make any knots! To undo them afterwards... Everything's fine! What a happy moment! - We have a good bed. - Is it flat? No bumps? I don't know, but it's a six star! We don't hear the motorway any more! This is good! The noise was driving me crazy. - We'll be traumatized! - We won't be able to sleep! Because it's too quiet! Why aren't they eating? Because there's manure on it! Come here! Heel! It's tough! Look at that! There isn't much at all! I don't know what's still in store for us. - Shall we go that way? - We'll try. Kiwi! - Titus, heel! - It's a girl. - Hello! - Hello! - How many sheep are there? - 800. 800? It looks like there were much less! If you want to count, maybe you'll find more! Is this the first time you've seen a flock of sheep? A neighbour has some, so it's not the first time. - I meant a transhumant flock. - No... yes. I don't know the word transhumance. You don't know what transhumance means? It means shifting from one point to another, it's a trip. I see. With a definite goal or not? The goal is to fatten them, make them eat. Afterwards they are intended for consumption. So they are eaten. The sheep... - You do that for how long? - Four months. In the off-season, when the vegetation is at rest. We glean everything that remains. Anything that wasn't mowed or harvested. I find this contrast of light and shade pretty. In this white area, which is like an A4 sheet. With the dog in the foreground. I think she prefers stories of sheep to speeches! I think she's a bit perturbed. She says to herself: "A bit highbrow for me!" She prefers running behind the legs of lamb, eh? Hey, my doggie! You understand that? You're a good dog! Irmate, you're a bit tiresome. Tutsi, are you watching? No, Tutsi! What is he doing? I don't believe it! Hey, move on! That's your fault, Carole! Carole! They're all going into the rapeseed field. Do as you please... No! What are you doing?! Put them on the other side! Now! Oh dear, oh dear! I don't believe it! Kiwi! Tutsi! Heel! Come on, Milien! Good! Now's the time for explanations! You've understood your mistake? Because you've made a big mistake! - I said to the left instead of right! - No, not really... You turned around much too late! And what was the dog doing? - He was playing with his muzzle... - No! You always want the last word! - So why are the sheep in there? - Because Tutsi wasn't... It's you who controls the dog, not the other way round! You certainly turned round too late. Some sheep were already stuck. You sent the dog in too late. You have to have eyes at the back of your head! You must anticipate! Because something like that shouldn't have happened! You're not even trying to understand, you need to do better next time! It's the sheep's fault... - Pardon? - You're not trying to understand! I don't need to understand this kind of situation! If the farmer turns up, he won't say that he understands. You could explain whatever you liked. There's only one way to progress. You won't get anywhere by being obtuse. You won't be able to do better next time. Something to cheer us up! Roesti or what? Pizza? Roesti? Pizza? - It's 10 o'clock. - You hungry? No, but... You should go. I think he told you. The sheep may not have much to eat, but we will have at least something. - Hello! - Hello! Thank you! - Two slices of pizza. - Very kind! Are you in charge of the bar? My wife said: "Take them something to eat, they'll appreciate it." Have a good day and good luck! It looks delicious. Yumm! - Don't you want a bite? - No. - It'll keep. - Yes, until tonight. - It was a good thing that I stayed behind. - You should have been more at the front. - No, did you see the others stray away? - Yes. What would you have done in that situation? I think we've always managed well enough. Come here. Come on! There's nothing. Strange... What's up, Figaro? There's something wrong. It hurts him above the hoof. - It's swollen. - Really? Looks like abscesses. You can see he's in pain. Well, Figaro, you'll go home. You've only just come out and have to go back. He's rather small! - He looks small next to the others. - Polo is rather small... He's happy. - Polo, we'll go see our friends! - He's tiny! Carole will be happy to load him up. He's her size. She said the donkeys were too tall. And who's that there? A friend. You know each other. You know each other! Turca! Polo! Who's that, Turca? Oh dear! You're easily scared! Turca, come here! That's it. Gently! Go easy! The speed of a shepherd isn't that of a walker. Which way now? Well, everybody is eating. Except the donkeys. - The donkeys had some hay. - Hey, Polo! - He must have been a little cold. - I think so. Leon! Gently, gently! Really...! Pascal, look! She's following me! Well done. Another one. As if we didn't have enough! Well, we're in good shape! Look at our new bell-wether. - Is it a male or a female? - A female. We should find a name for her. Tabasco, stop! We know you love bread. Milien seems to keep growing. - Don't give it all to them. Keep some! - I got some more. - Marcel is looking at you! - Yes, he'll get a piece. But the newcomers first! She's pretty, huh? Don't you find her pretty? With her black nose. They're all pretty! She understood. A bell... But maybe you don't want old stuff? This one, maybe. - But the clapper's missing. - Oh, I see. What about the one below? That rusty one. - That's the one! Brilliant! - Is that okay? Making new with old. - That's called recycling. - It'll do just fine. - The final fitting. - To baptize the new bell-wether. It has a thick neck like that. Let's get going. Hey, Marylin! Stay there! Marylin, the boss! Hey, Marylin, come! Don't be scared of me now. Irmate, come on! - Pascal! - Yes? - Shall I put them in the clearing? - Sure. Turn right, up there! Kiwi, move to the right! Impossible! I don't know if my beard is full of stones... but this thing doesn't work well. It's a bit feeble. - I left the soap and shampoo for you. - Okay. - Need anything else? - No. We're all clean now. The cart's been cleaned. Pretty, Carole! - We're all fresh now. - Like the winter air. What are you doing right now, Mike? I have heifers, do some wood... two three meetings. - Winter passes very quickly. - It's delicious! - I told you we had to do something. - They don't eat every day... - You're spoiling us. - Are there young people who do that? I'm no longer young myself. Do you know any young people who will do this job? - Unfortunately not. - It'll disappear. You have to be present round the clock, there's no Saturday, no Sunday and it's also in any weather. I think it's like a sailor's job. There used to be many Italians. Only Italians. It's a Bergamask tradition. I started transhumance with people from Bergamo in order to learn. I was with Pietro Salvodeli, who didn't speak a word of French. So I had to learn Italian. He was very pleased with me, although I was only a helper. Then he called me "the American", because I did anything. I went to get a bundle of hay, I went shopping... I was also motivated because it was something I liked. I also had to cope with a lot of verbal abuse, because Bergamasks are tough. In the first winter, we drank milk from the farm and ate bacon and cheese. We didn't even light a fire. We didn't have hot meals. - How old were you then? - 20. I've been doing this for 32 years. - So I'm still ok... - You've not even done half! - You'll have another 20 years of it. - We'll see. How many years have you passed by here? - 20 years? - I think so. - Did you know my husband? - I think so. So he passed by already in those years. - I was knitting socks, remember? - I do. - Still put some on? - Yes. Oh, well then, I can start all over again. - I can make you some, if you like. - No problem! - Bye for now, see you next year! - Goodbye, thank you very much! The sheep are fast asleep. Because they ate well last night. I'll light the fire and then you'll get up, ok? What's up, Turca? Never seen me before? I'll get the pan out if the dog wants to eat. Leon, gently. It's going to be a beautiful day! No, Tutsi, that's not for you! Tutsi, here. Léon, here you are! - Was there no jam? - You want some jam? Where is it? It's not here. Yes, it is. When I was a kid, we drank "Banania". My uncle was responsible for the ads. "Drink Banania, spring energy all day!" Anyway, there's no more Banania. We have tea instead. You remember the head on a spring? Not bad. - That's not my generation! - It's older... "Y a bon Banania!" Tutsi! Heel! Kiwi! Kiwi! No, Titus! Look at the sheep. Heel, I said! Titus, heel! Sit! Stay, I said! Could you fix that hook for me? - The hook is loose? - Yes, it's loose. Thank you. Titus, heel! Now! Titus! Heel! Titus, sit! Sit and stay. Stop bothering him, Leon! Sit and don't move. - Hello! - Hello! - Watch out for the bales of hay. - Sure, that's why I'm here. On the other side of the road is my land. I don't want the sheep there. - But I can still cross it to pass. - I don't want any sheep on it! - That plain's mostly ours too. - Where? - Over there. - There's corn. On the other side of the road is my land. There's grass there too. - That little house? - It's a chapel. But there's another house on the other side? Between the chapel and the house there is grass, but I don't want the sheep. Because these bales are ours! I don't want them to pinch any! - But we won't be over there anyway. - Where will you go afterwards? - Molondin. - How will you get there? By road. No way. The town council prohibited sheep on that road a few years ago. - Why? - Because of the drainage. - We put some clover... - Stop! Some clover. You take it all until there's nothing left. - We're not staying long. - We can't go there with the heifers. We cut the grass early so that it grows again, and you come and help yourself at night when the temperature is below zero. That's not on. - For city dwellers, it's nice, eh! - It smells of Christmas! - You think it's nice for the shepherd? - Pardon? You say it's nice for city dwellers, but for shepherds? The shepherd has chosen, just like we did. When you need the vet at night... So you've chosen to sleep outside and to take care of these animals... - It takes passion to do this! - That's right. - Carole! - Yes? We're passing through there. He doesn't want us to pass through his land. To hell with him! Gently, gently! - Carole, gently! - What? Stop! What's he talking about? Titus! Kiwi, heel! Now! - Gently, Carole! - Huh? There are still many behind. Stop! - Carole! Stop them! - Ok, I'm stopping them. Can you wait over there, please? Can you reverse? We're going there! Up there. Back. You'll go round that planted area! Tutsi! Heel! Move on! Tutsi! Heel! No! Come here, Tutsi! Come on! What's up with you? Kiwi, heel! Heel, I said! To the right! Hey! Kiwi, Tutsi! No, move on! You've been bitten or what? Yeah, sure! Look at that! That was Titus! The muzzle for you! We'll have to put it on him! Make him understand. - We don't want him to bite too many. - Sure. - What? - Yes! Put it on, so he understands. He's already bitten one. We're off! Is that manure? They're not even taking a sniff at it! Over there, maybe above the hedge, Carole? - Over the hedge? - Looks like grass... - You want me to go there? - Yes. - They won't even sniff at it. - Not good! Stop being a pain in the neck. You'll see what you'll get for a meal! Carole, come on back! We're leaving. - There used to be grass there. - Right... We can't go via there any more because of all the buildings. - Disneyland! - Always have to go further. Titus, heel! Titus, heel! Come here! Heel! Who is leaving today? Number 1 to number 50. Don't say that... They still find lots to eat on these plots. - You ok, boss? - I'm fine. You look a little tired. - Life's not easy. - But you're happy! - Carole! - Yes? You want me to count them or catch them? - Pascal will have to catch them. - You count them. - Wait a minute, this one's ok. - Not so sure. - He has the right feel. - That's right. Kiwi, come here! Heel! Kiwi, stop! - Stop! Kiwi, I said stop! - Out of the way! Buzz off! We're no longer young! If they're not happy with the goods, I quit. 52 less. Gone! I want less than that. Come here! Heel! - Was there no mail? - No, there wasn't. That means no bills, a good thing. No, give me less. - Kiwi, heel! - Did you pay those bills? - Everything. - I forgot your salary! Carole! I forgot to pay him his salary. Never mind! I will go to the salvation army. - So next week... - I'll see how things go with the client. Meaning? If they want leg of mutton for Christmas. There'll be orders every week. - Who's Leon's father? - Titus. - Are you sure? - Titus or Tim. - You see? There are already two! - Who cares? It's a family matter! - But those cross-breeds... - I think it's Titus! That's no cross-breed, he's completely balanced. He mustn't learn bad habits with you! They have to be trained young. I always say: You can't straighten the trunk of a curved tree! Once the trunk is twisted, it's twisted! Normally you have to take a training course and you must have a licence. - You want to do it? - We should enrol you! I'll pay for it! You have to keep your dog on your right. They'd all run away! Because they don't give dogs to just anybody now. - Thank you. - You understand. - Hey, Leon! - We can see the result! - Bye, Carole! - Bye, Jean-Paul! For Christmas, please your relatives with our chocolate truffles. This week our special offer: Lamb from New Zealand. - Wait! - Leon! Leon, come here! - Wait, dogs. - Leon, come on! Wait, Tutsi! That's it. Serving temperature... - 10 degrees. So we must be ok. - Yes! I hurt my finger on barbed wire again. It wasn't our easiest day today. I think we didn't do so badly. - Makes a nice change. - Great! How kind of you! The invigorating sea. Delicious! I'll make you some toast... So delicious you'll never forget! That's interesting! Wait. Don't you want butter on it? - You could have put a little more. - Really? - It's well spread! - But I'll only eat one, so... I didn't want to put too much because you'd have said it was too much. You don't get to eat foie gras every day. - A treat! - Yes, it's good. It's well flavoured. No! It's alright... - Well, Merry Christmas! - It's beautiful! You don't eat Christmas cake any more because people say it sucks. So you stop eating Christmas cake. - I like Christmas cake. - Sure, it's a tradition. That's a nice piece. A piece enough for four. It's not even been rolled. They cheated. No, it's ok. - Not a real Christmas cake. - Fine by me. - This is Leon's first Christmas. - Next year he should start working. He'll get yelled at. - Do the bells ring midnight? - You want to go to mass? I go to bed. I don't think they rang midnight... There's one who says I'm right. Quick! - Stop! Lift his head! - Sure. Before catching him, you have to lift his head. - I caught more sheep than you. - But you're stronger than I am! - Other side. - How many more? We mark around forty. Put him straight. Like that! Let the lamb go! Hands like that and like that. So he holds still. Carole, spread your hand...! Touch it now. This one's fine. Super. - It's got a lot of strength! - It's ok! Don't move, stop! - Won't you catch a cold like that? - I'm hot right now. - You've been sweating... - You don't sweat much! Pardon? Thanks! You think locating the fat ones doesn't make you sweat? You don't put the plastic stuff on, that's why you don't sweat. - I'm wet up to my knees. - Oh, poor darling! I'm soaking wet. I'm getting fragile. Oh, beautiful grass here! Come on, Carole! We have to pull the sheep! I've found a field of grass... it's the seven wonders of the world combined! - How long will we will stay here? - Tonight and tomorrow. - Relaxed. - That's right. There's a sheep over there! What are you doing? It's looking at itself in the mirror! You want to go eat in the kitchen? - Super. - Thank you. Look at that. There are even little truffles! - They look good. - Not home-made... - May I offer you one? - Certainly. Thank you. - Oh, no, Leon! - Leon! It's ok, he's removing the weeds. I think it gives you energy and it's also soothing. Very soothing. That's right. It's relaxing. We're already behind schedule, but this is beating all records. - Hi! How are you? - Yeah, great. - Where is Pascal? - We crossed him near the forest. The spoon is ready. What about the fondue? - Will it be ok? - Yes, it will! You've been going fast this year... Usually we see you towards Oron. - We went to Ferlan, had to turn back. - Too much snow? It's going to be cooked quickly! - Our traditional fondue! - Yes, it's looks great! Speaking of coincidences: my father had been in the Algerian war. When it was over, he was waiting in a queue at the port of Marseille before joining his barracks in Paris. A guy next to him said: "Shall we swap? I would love to visit Paris." They exchanged places within five seconds. So he left for Maurienne. My father ended up in Maurienne, the other guy went to Paris. He was in Modane, met my mother, got married and I was born. You met Pascal... I was supposed to go to Bulgaria, not Switzerland. It's amazing, you met Pascal and you dropped everything. But I knew something was going to happen. - Or you wanted something to happen? - Yes, that's right. You were waiting for the signs of destiny. I was in Brest in my apartment. Work, come home, eat, sleep... It sucked. A quiet life. - No regrets choosing this life? - None whatever. She's taking on authority, starting to command. - I have my bell-wethers... - I've nothing more to tell her. Sometimes I tell her to leave with the herd and show me how to do it. She lowers her voice and tells herself: Oh-oh. Now I'm in front, but I still yell: "Pascal, which way?" You feel that you progress... You don't look far ahead enough... If you're alone, you won't ask: "Pascal, which way?" You just do it. You've got a strong character, won't let yourself be trampled on. No, not with Pascal. But we both got a strong character, so we get on well. Sometimes I get angry. I tell him what's what. I'm quite surprised that she gets angry. Sometimes I get angry, because I feel that the situation is unfair. Then I raise my voice... Look at the moon! It's amazing! Magnificent! - Very bright! - I love it! - Ok, boss? - Yes, sure. - Were you on time? - Check out the beautiful sun! - It was cold last night. - There are still icicles on your car. - Temperature was below 7 or 8. - Really? - It was cold. - We didn't sleep a wink. - Because of the moon and all. - Yet you were tired... - Dry air is good for the lungs. - It's the anxiety of going home. You're fed up and want to cry because it's over. There are times when too much is too much. He'll spend one week on the couch and then: "Give me a herd of sheep." - He'll get depressed. - That's normal, isn't it? Every year, it's the same: he says he wants to stop. And suddenly there's a big gap... - Nice lot yesterday, wasn't it? - I'll tell you tomorrow. Titus, stop! - How many? - Eleven. So four more. Titus, stop! Almost finished your trip... Next year. If you knew how lucky you are to be saved. You don't want to be cooked? Hey, Polo! What's wrong? What happened, Polo? Did you slip? A little more effort! Come, Polo! Like that! Yes! Yes, Polo! Come, you're a good boy! Paquerette, you're sinking in the mud. Titus, go push them. Come on! Do it! Sleep here? In an open field? - Want to sleep in the forest? - I don't care! Want to sleep in a house? - There is no storm, it's quiet. - That's not it! You're upset. I'm trying to find a place that's best for the sheep. Can you see if it's a declining slope... We can leave them against the hedge. They'll be sheltered by the trees. If they want to go down, let them. Perhaps there is a ledge over there. Because that's a large forest. So maybe we could go down, we haven't even checked. That's why I asked you to go and see. And what did you reply? - "I'll go". - That you didn't mind! Found nothing convenient? Apparently. Is there ivy in the forest? Didn't you check that? They would have eaten it anyway. - What's up? - Always trying to wangle it your way! Even if they've already eaten, they will eat ivy. They need a little dry matter. So they're happy to eat ivy! Always a little extra. - This one goes on top. - Leave it like that. You prefer it like that? I did it differently for you. - Yes, boss? - Arnold has just called me. He said: "Professionals!" "Maison Peguiron". - Really? - He was happy. - A beautiful lot! - Magnificent! How much on average? 23? - Or 23 to 24? - I'll know tomorrow. - Ok, but was he happy? - Yes, I told you. Let me tell you, we served him well. True professionals! You should be happy to have a good shepherd! Sure, we're not considered clowns! - We're not clowns! - Of course not! It's really great! You'll sleep well then? Bye! So, we're professionals! These sheep were great! Sheep like that! Even despite all the snow we managed to have good sheep. It's nice to be complimented once in a while! The sheep are waking up! They are getting up. Where do they want to go now? Leon, come! That's good, come! Good dog! Leon! Left! Stop, Leon! What are you doing? Leon, to the left! Push them! Leon, to the left! Push them to the right! That's good, push! I think we will do as in Mongolia... bless the earth and fire. As they do with milk, we will do with wine. - I feel like doing that. - The transhumance went well. Let's thank all that surrounds us, all that's missing, abstract, surreal and that is keeping watch over us. Because I'm convinced that we have a protector who guides us. - Irmate! - Irmate! Hurry up if you want to leave. Titus, come! Tutsi, quiet! Marcel, a little effort! Go, Lulu! Irmate and Marylin, see you next year. Let's go! - Irmate will be the last one. - She's a rebel, a Fellaga. - That's my Irmate. - Get inside! Another transhumance finished. Tabasco is looking at me. - Titus, you were still nice this year! - Sure! Sometimes he pinched them a bit, though. - Got tears in your eyes, Polo? - Everything comes to an end. That's true for everything, even romantic relationships. - Oh that... - Going to Clarens? - Yes, to make a delivery. - Don't deliver the bell-wethers! Do they all have a bell at least? You can't go wrong with the bell-wethers. You recognize Marylin by a small stain on her nose. - Marylin, where are you going? - Bye bye!
