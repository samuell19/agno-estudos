I'm fine, ma'am. How are you? I'm great. What's wrong with me? That's good to know, ma'am. - Greetings. - Greetings, dear. Greetings. - Sit, dear. - Yes. I was quite adamant that you would be the first one.. ..to interview me regarding this novel of mine. If you had allowed someone else to interview you.. ..I would have been very upset. How could I let you get upset? So, how do you find the cover of this novel? It's beautiful, ma'am. All your novels always have beautiful covers. I really liked the title of this one. God's Mercy. Ma'am, why did you name your biography, God's Mercy? Guru Nanak has said.. The string through the nose is in the hands of the Lord Master.. ..one's own actions drive him on. Wherever his food is, there he eats it O Nanak, this is the Truth. The precious lesson that I've learnt from the journey of my life is.. ..that God decides your fate beforehand.. ..and there's nothing that you can do to change it. If we surrender to the will of God then life becomes very peaceful. Life is not that bad, after all. You have to walk towards the destination that God.. ..has planned for you, whether you're happy or not. Anyway, I don't want to reveal too many details. Let me tell you about the novel, basically. My novel is in two parts. The first is about separation and the second is about union. Why the separation and then union, ma'am? I'll tell you. The first part begins with the year 1948. In small village called Allowal, near Naba. We lived in a joint family. Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and lots of children. When my mother would cook.. ..she would teach me to make small 'Rotis' alongside. My father was tall and huge. I used to took tiny in front of him. My aunt was very protective of me. My maternal grandfather was a Tax Officer. He would often visit our village to meet his widowed daughter. What are you sitting here for? Who will get the milk? I'll go in some time, Sister-in-law. I was feeding Basant. She was starving. She starves all the time. Give that to me. And do what I've asked you to. Give me the plate. Sister-in-law, what's the big deal if I feed her first? - She's hungry. - Stand up, I say! You've been talking too much! Just because my son-in-law is dead.. ..it doesn't mean my daughter can be ill-treated. I can feed my daughter for the rest of her life. Such tiffs are common between sisters-in-law. She never killed her, did she? She is the daughter of Inder Singh, the Tax Officer. Let alone killing her, no one can even raise their voice against her. It's only been two months since her husband died. If this is how they've been treating her now.. ..I wonder what they'll do in the future. She cannot live there anymore, no matter what. Pratap has been appointed as a Tax Officer in Sangrur. It's been four years since his wife passed away. He has a little child, but no one to look after him. He's a nice man. They are well-to-do. But think about the society. Those who have committed a crime must think about the society. If half of them oppose this decision the other half will be in favour of it. India is independent now. People's thinking about widow remarriage has changed. It's not the same anymore. All right. As you all deem fit. Aunt. I don't want to remarry. Look at the way she talks! You're a woman. Let them get their daughter married if they want to. But my granddaughter isn't going anywhere. My granddaughter will be raised in my house. Aunt, she won't be able to live without me. I've never separated from her for even a second. It's okay. Relax. Girls are meant to leave you someday. We've parted from our daughters too. But she's a child, Aunt. She doesn't even ask for food when she's hungry. Who will understand her over there? It's a huge family. I'm sure they'll understand. Anyway, that's their problem. If only my family could understand my feelings! All right, then. Do both the councils consent? All right. Read this. 'Mr. Inder Singh, the Tax Officer..' '..may get his daughter, Gurdev Kaur, remarried.' 'However, Mr. Kashmira Singh will take custody of his granddaughter.' 'Whatever the girl rightfully deserves..' '..in terms of the property, will be transferred to her name.' 'Also, at the right time, Mr. Kashmira Singh..' '..will get his granddaughter married into a good family.' 'Considering the relationship of a mother with her daughter..' '..it has also been decided that the child will be taken to..' '..her maternal grandfather's house to meet her mother every six months.' Mom, who will calm me down when I cry? Dear, those whose souls are one they reside in one another. They cannot be separated. When you laugh, I will laugh within you. When you cry, I will cry within you. Dear.. I'm doing this only for your sake. Be a good girl. Don't be naughty. Your aunt really cares for you. Always obey her, dear. Also, don't run around bare feet! Mom.. "The ground has slipped from under my feet." "My world seems ruined." "Who will hear my cries?" "Only you can understand me, O' crow." "O' crow.. Pass on my message." "O' crow.. Pass on my message." "Tell the merciless Lord.." "Tell the merciless Lord.." "..never to separate a daughter from her mother." "O' crow.. Pass on my message." "O' crow.. Pass on my message." "When I gave birth to a girl, there was silence all around." "When we laughed, they were silent. When we cried, they were silent." "Don't forget the lullabies I sang to you." "The lullabies I sang to you." "I would feed you to your heart's content." "I would feed you to your heart's content." "Tell the merciless Lord.." "Tell the merciless Lord, never to separate a daughter from her mother." "O' crow.. Pass on my message." "O' crow.. Pass on my message." Uncle, when will mom come? I'll come to pick you, dear. Go now. I kept staring at that path for days together. Neither did uncle come, nor anyone else. My mom didn't come either. Was there no news of your mom? Upon hearing the conversations of my elders. I did understand that mom was married into an affluent family. Dear. When your grandpa comes to take you.. ..tell him that you don't want to go with him. Tell him that you don't miss your mother and that you're happy here. Okay? Okay, dear? Will you tell him that? How will you say it? I don't want to go to my maternal grandpa's house. I don't miss mom. I don't want to go to my maternal grandpa's house. I don't miss mom. I'm happy in my paternal grandfather's house. She's a child. She can forget her. But how can her mother forget her? Sir, you're right. But when time has healed her wounds why should we incite it? Let her be happy here. By God's grace, if your daughter has a child she'll be occupied with him. A year later, they decided to get me married while I'm a child. I'm aging. I wonder if my children will look after her once I'm gone. Hence, I want to make sure that she settles down while I'm alive. Look at the game of destiny, Sister-in-law. The mother just got married and now, she's going to get married too. Right. It seems, they'll live quite close by. It's not too far from her in-laws' house. The in-laws of the mother and the daughter are neighbours. God's ways are unique. Who came to give you the auspicious gifts? I don't know. Did you see what you got? Grandma put it in a box. But when I get my auspicious gifts I'll eat all the sweets from it. I'll share some with you all as well. "I'll wear the wedding attire." "Now is the time for separation." "Now there will be blessings." "My dear daughter goes to her in-laws." "This is the game of destiny." "My dear daughter goes to her in-laws." "My dear daughter goes to her in-laws." You wear these shoes. Your shoes are broken. Give that to me. I'll get new ones at my in-laws' house. Keep all my clothes too. Okay, Sister. I'll keep some for you. You can wear them when you visit us. I don't know when I'll be visiting you again. Do you know how far their house is? My mom lives there too. Okay, bye. They must be waiting for me. Sister, the procession left. They forgot to take you. Take me along! I got left behind. "O Lord, you don't hear, even if I am crying." "My prayers don't reach you." "All my dreams are unfulfilled." What are you doing here? Aunt! The procession left. They forgot to take me along. No, dear, they haven't forgotten you. We'll send you to your in-laws once you're an adult. You're too young now. "Where is God hidden? Left with nothing." "Where is God hidden?" Motherly love was showering from the sky for everyone. Perhaps, that love gave me the courage. Days passed by, and I grew up. But the wound in me did not heal. It was still the same. But perhaps, time had suppressed it somewhere. Even though I appeared happy, there was a void in me. Now, the second part of the story. Union. It was the year 1962 during the Indo-China war. There were army camps on the tall mountains. Mehtaab Singh! You've been summoned! Yes, no problem. It will all be here. Sir! There you are! This Mehtaab Singh is here. But we summoned Constable Mehtaab Singh. Anyway, I'm glad that you're here. Here he is. Sir! Sir, their names are causing great nuisance. When we call one, the other appears. Not just our names, sir. Our addresses are almost the same, too. - Really? - Mehtaab Singh and I are neighbours. How far are your villages? - Quite close by, sir. - But the councils are separate. I hope you don't get shot by the Chinese while they intend to shoot him. A bullet doesn't have the person's name written on it. True. But it could also happen that one Mehtaab Singh becomes a martyr.. ..and the message is sent to the other Mehtaab Singh. That's not a problem either. I have no one who'd mourn my death. The report is.. ..the Chinese army has proceeded 18 kilometres ahead in the past 24 hours. The present frontline is right ahead of this mountain. In the next 24 hours, we'll have to form a post on the top. We can do it, sir. I know we can. But they've been firing every two hours. We'll have to send a party in advance. Come. The cold is killing me! - It's 10. - 10? Mehtaab, why didn't you get married? I didn't find anyone. What's wrong? Actually, my family got killed in the war of 1946. Oh! My grandfather and I somehow got to Bathinda from Sialkot, alive. A few years later, grandpa passed away. My friend, I don't even know which caste I belong to. I have a vague idea, though. So, who'd marry their daughter to me? Who raised you? I managed somehow. God sent an angel. Back in the village, in Khiwa. Two houses away from mine. A kind woman got married and came there. She was like a mother figure to me. She'd feed me. I was raised at her mercy. Then, when there was an opening. I took admission in Bathinda. What's the big deal? Not everyone in the world is married. I'm sure you feel like you should get married. It's all God's will. It's just a few of them. Our guns are nothing as compared to theirs. I'll tell you what. Go back.. ..and give them the location of this Chinese camp. We'll go together.. ..and inform them.. ..that we've conquered the Chinese troop. Mehtaab Singh, I've recommended an army medal for you. Your bravery is outstanding. I regret one thing, though. I couldn't bring Mehtaab's body along. But it was also important to inform.. ..about the location of the enemy's camp. Mehtaab Singh served his nation.. ..and became a martyr. None of us can forget him, ever. Anyway. A report has arrived from Delhi! The war is over! What's the result? Well.. ..China will take possession now. China will take possession? You mean, we have to surrender? We're still alive! If the entire Indian army had become martyrs.. ..it would be okay to accept that we lost. Bheem Singh, you need to understand the situation. Understand the situation? That's rubbish! You understand the situation. I, Bheem Singh, don't understand the situation. This is not right! This is not right! All you do is hold legal proceedings in Delhi. You pass judgements! I, Bheem Singh, do not accept your decision! We're still alive. We want to fight. We're steady! You should have at least sent us there. We would have ripped those Chinese apart! How can the war.. Harnek Singh. Shoot me. I said, shoot me! I don't want to go home defeated. I want to go as a martyr. Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me, I say! Shoot me! I want to speak to the Prime Minister! Let me speak to him. I want to speak to him.. Bheem Singh! This is the life of us soldiers! I want to meet.. We erect camps as brave men.. ..but at times, we are helpless to pull them down. Take Mehtaab Singh's belongings to his village. You too visit your home for a few days. "Life is full of sorrow." "Life is full of sorrow." "Life is full of sorrow." "Life is full of sorrow." "The world is in a mess." "God is the only hope." "True friends don't leave your side." "No matter what the circumstances are." "The world is how you perceive it." "Life is full of sorrow." "Life is full of sorrow." Yes? Greetings. Greetings. I've brought the belongings. Whose belongings? It's martyr Mehtaab Singh's bed. "Death is inevitable." "Everyone has to accept it." "Death brings silence to all the noise." "Life is full of sorrow." "Life is full of sorrow." "You need not go to a holy place." "God is within you." Basant Kaur's signatures on this document. Basant Kaur hasn't arrived at her in-laws' house yet. She's still in her maternal house. Which village? Allowal, near Naba. - Can you give me the address? - Yes. "Don't try to please God all the time." "Work hard." "Don't ruin your life living in misconceptions." "Life is full of sorrow." "Life is full of sorrow." Stop. Let's drink water. Ma'am. Can you give me some water? Yes. The village ahead is Allowal? Yes. I want to go to Mr. Kashmira Singh's house. He passed away. I'm sure his family still lives there. As soon as you step inside the village.. ..the big house that you'll see is theirs. Thank you. Why was he asking about my house? Is he the soldier you're married to? But, why is he here? It's not time for me to be sent to my in-laws yet. Perhaps, he's come for your brother's wedding. He needs to go to Allowal. Will you take him along? Thank you, mister. You are.. Well, I am a teacher at the big school. I see. I pass by this place every day. I'm glad I got an opportunity to serve you. You've been serving the nation too. Yes. Who are you visiting, in Allowal? Mr. Kashmira Singh. I learnt that he's no more. Yes. I belong to that family. He was my grandfather. He passed away. Sir, a girl from your family, Basant Kaur.. - Is she married to someone from Khiwa? - Right. Soldier Mehtaab Singh? Yes. She's my sister. She's yet to be sent to her in-laws' house. We've learnt that he's become a soldier. He too serves the nation, like you. Serving the nation.. Serving the nation isn't easy, sir. Often, a person loses everything in the process. Sir.. ..why are you beating around the bush? Tell me what the matter is. What are you trying to say? Mehtaab Singh became a martyr while trying to fight the Chinese. I've brought his bedding. I need Basant Kaur's signatures. Sir.. Sir, get a grip. This is a disaster. God is never kind to some people. She's been unfortunate ever since she was little. Her father died when she was very young. Her mother married another man. Our family raised her. She's a very nice girl. What do I do now? Get up, sir. Get up. Control yourself. "Brother, your mare is blue." Here she is. Come here, dear. - Come here. - She's here. Come. What do I sing? The song about the mare. Grandma. - The mare one.. - Yes, sure, begin. "Brother, your mare is quite smart." "Brother, your mare is quite smart." Where's the groom? I hope he hasn't fled. Hey, pass me that. - Give that to me. - Listen, just.. - Give me. - Go outside and.. Go and relax inside. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Do what you want. "Pacify him." "Brother seems upset today." "Pacify him." Sister-in-law, did a soldier come here? From where was he supposed to come? - From there. - No soldier came here. "Brother seems upset today." "Pacify him by getting decked up." One can never judge the weather. Sometimes, it's sunny. And suddenly, there's mist. I needed to ask for a favour. Tell me. There is a wedding in my family. It's my youngest uncle's son's wedding. The one he is marrying is my friend's daughter. We have to maintain relations. If something goes wrong at the wedding.. ..it will be a problem. I mean that.. ..you can give this news to my family.. ..after five days. The wedding will be done by then. Master, my village is 200 kilometres away from here. If I go back now.. ..it will be difficult to return. Sir, I will make arrangements for your stay here for the next five days. I request you. Sir. The girl's parents have gone to visit Vaishnudevi. They might take five to six days to return. It might take that long. But you don't worry about anything. Your stay here will be comfortable. Our elders have had good relations with that family. Fine, Master. Are you sure? Did you see carefully? Is he the same soldier? How many more soldiers just walk around in our village? What were they talking about? I couldn't hear from so far away. But they were talking about something serious. Nobody here knows anything about it. Bahadur doesn't mention anything to anyone. Ever since he became a teacher, he doesn't care about anyone. All he thinks about is himself. I feel, brother is absolutely ready. - Ready for what? - To send you off. Yes! It is your turn after Brother's wedding. I have got two outfits stitched. I know, we went together to get them stitched. - That's great. - That's great. Brother, shall I bring you some lassi? It's time to send you off. Listen, a friend of mine is visiting. He is a soldier. He won't stay in this house. But we must send his food from here. Send the food on time. Okay. Sisters, the cotton is too much. How do I take it? I might drop it. Can't we just let it be? No. This is not much. I can carry it easily. - Listen to that. - Why? Don't we have to take ladoos? Yes! That's right. No problem. We will send the ladoos later. We haven't even started making them yet. Yes, right! Distribute all the ladoos in the village. But don't give it to the priests. This is wrong. Give them some ladoos. We'll distribute in the village later. - Take it, dear. - Come on. Sister-in-law, you.. What happened? I will do it. Sister-in-law, you can give us the food too. We're leaving. We'll give it at the shop. - Alright, I'll pack it. - Fine. Soldier, I am going out. You take care of the shop in the meantime. Nobody shows up at this hour. If someone comes, weigh the groceries and give them. Sir, how would I know what to sell at what price? We don't deal in money. Here, we trade with grains. People can take whatever they want in exchange of graisn. You just make sure that the grains are all right. I'll be back soon. - Fine. - I'll return soon. - Is he here? - Come here. - You see who is here. - Nobody's here. Tell him. Brother. He is not here. He has gone somewhere. I've brought food from the Master's house. Thank you. Wait. Talk to him. Go. She wanted to ask you something. Yes, go ahead. She wanted to know your name. My name is Mehtaab Singh. Tell him your name too. - Yes. - Yes, it'll be fine. Come. She wanted to tell you her name too. Yes, tell me. Her name is Mrs. Basant. Well, you forgot the lassi. When he heard your name, he was stunned. Come. Dear, whenever you miss me, look at the stars. You will be under the same stars as I will be. Here come the in-laws! There's nothing to worry now. I'm glad you returned. I was waiting for you, Aunt. - Well, I was supposed to return. - No! What took you so long to come? What do I do, Sister-in-law? I never wanted to go. Mother-in-law is after me. Unbelievable! You're still stuck on that. You should have told your mother-in-law that it's your nephew's wedding. What's the big deal? Daughter-in-law, surely serve something sweet to the son-in-law. I have made kheer for uncle. Kheer has been prepared for the uncle! Oh, Lord! These are 'Pinnis' from home. This wasn't necessary.. Come on. Did you see how he was looking? All my life, I will serve you. 'When someone does good deeds' 'God rewards them.' 'He eradicates sorrow. He shows light after darkness.' Why did you say that you'd serve him? She is afraid that he might leave her again. If he has come here to take her, he surely will. Yes! Come on. "The love is true, no matter what the situation is." "He's making me yearn. He's making me restless." "The love is true, no matter what the situation is." "I will share everything with you." "I will share everything with you." "I will let you live in my eyes, beloved, I will laugh with you." "I will let you live in my eyes, beloved, I will laugh with you." "I've heard water from wells." "I've heard water from wells." "I see the God in you. That is why I pray to you." "I see the God in you. That is why I pray to you." "There is a breeze of happiness." "There is a breeze of happiness." "God has united two people on this auspicious day." "God has united two people on this auspicious day." Keep this dress and blanket in the truck. Take it. - In this? - Yes. Come and have a look at this. Coming, Sister-in-law. Fold them properly. Sure. They've been stuffing the trunk with brother's wedding blankets. No one's talking about you. That is why I was surprised. My husband is here. But nobody talks about it. Didn't brother tell anyone? I'm sure he must have told everyone. But someone should have reacted. These heavy ones, Sister-in-law? Yes, that one. Fine. This is so heavy. Sister, you ask Aunt. We'll go out. Should I ask? You should. It's fine. Aunt! - Come on now. - You're here, dear. Keep this on top. - Someone might get hurt. - Come. Aunt, I wanted to talk to you. Tell me, dear. What is it? Actually, do you know Mehtaab Singh, who is staying at the shop? Are you all planning to send me off with him? No, dear. It's nothing like that. He is here. Brother Bahadur asked him to stay at the shop. Oh, Lord! Why did he come then? Did he come for brother's wedding? No! Nothing such was mentioned at home. I will speak to Bahadur. I too was shocked upon hearing this, Aunt. I was swept off my feet in shock. I did what I thought was right, at the moment. I let that soldier stay for five days in the village. I begged him to give the news once the wedding was complete. He's a loner. He has no family. But he is nice. So, he agreed. Aunt. Why don't we do this? This marriage was fixed by our father and his father. Now, it has been years since the elders passed away. We have no connection between us now. Everyone here knows.. ..that she is married to the soldier Mehtaab Singh. Sir, you know everything. She was a child when she got married. We didn't send her off. She doesn't have parents. And now this has happened. I wonder why I am being punished. My daughter is a gem of a person. Ma'am, I respect your emotions I'm a traveller. I came here to give you this bed. And now, I will go back to my world. Sir, this is all destiny. When God unites two destinies, they find their ways. You.. I mean.. You don't have a family too. Even you could settle down. And she will also have a family. But is the girl ready for this? Did you talk to her, and ask her? Sir, the girl is still young. If she makes a wrong decision, she'll regret for life. I and aunt have decided. We will not find a nice man like you for her. We will send her off with you. She will understand when she grows older. Later, she'll thank God. At least few people should know about this. Some elder should know. No, dear. It is better to keep this a secret. If more people find out, this news will spread like wildfire. Fine. You are the elders. Listen to me. What happened to your educated man? Are you not ashamed? You've made the son-in-law stay at another's place for so many days. Girls! Make some sweet. We need to send food to the guest. He kept eating bland food for so many days. And get a nice mattress from inside and send it to him. You have kept him at a useless place. Tell me something. Why didn't you inform us before? That Mehtaab Singh is at his house? I thought that you all were busy with the arrangements of the wedding. Had you found out that he has arrived.. ..you'd pamper him and not do all these jobs. What are you saying? You should use that teacher's mind at your school. You always try to be a smarty-pant here. Darn this teacher. Let it be. What is to be done now? We will send her off in two days. What else to do? Tell me something. Why are you in a rush? Can't you wait? There are talks going on. The situation at the China border is devastating. He has a few days off. I wonder when he'd return. He's right. So, tell us, Mom, what do we do? Well, do as you deem fit. Fine, let's make arrangements. - Really? - Yes, let's do it. All right, then. In the name of the Lord. "I have begun to have dreams about you. Oh, God, watch over us." "We both are going to unite. Oh, God, watch over us." "I have begun to have dreams about you. Oh, God, watch over us."

"Oh, God, watch over us." - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Who is that, Uncle? I don't recognise him. - Wow! - Get up, pal. Have some 'Pinni'. Did you make it? They were delicious. How are you, Mehtaab? - Would you like to eat something? - Bheem Singh, what brings you here? Yes, my sister is married to someone in this village. I see. - Come on. - This is great. We.. It is not right for a soldier to do something wrong, Mehtaab. Instead of mourning for the martyr Mehtaab Singh.. ..you are marrying his fiancée. This is betrayal. That is not true. I will explain everything later. What will you explain to me? It is not wrong to marry a widow, Mehtaab. But betraying someone is indeed wrong. It is not just about you. This will bring humiliation to the army. And I will not let you carry out this misdeed. Guddi. Hey, Guddi! Yes? Greetings. Who is that man in the purple turban? He is my uncle. - So, let me talk to him. - Let it be, Bheem Singh. This is helping someone settle down. Where is sister? I don't mind you settling down, Mehtaab. Actually, I have witnessed it all. It would've been different had I not seen it. And yet, if I stay mum about it, I'll be equally a part in this crime. And you cannot ask.. ..a soldier to do wrong. You can continue your love story. I will wage war. Bheem Singh. So, mister, is it true? It is true. Bring the blade! I will behead this man! "I smiled and endured all the pain." "Because of you, I'm left alone in this world." "I smiled and endured all the pain." "Because of you, I'm left alone in this world." "I got taunted by the world. But that is fine, O' Lord." "I am like a refugee who is thrown out of his city." "I got taunted by the world. But that is fine, O' Lord." "I am like a refugee who is thrown out of his city." "I kept looking and it kept raining." "I kept explaining it to the world." "I kept looking and it kept raining." "I kept explaining it to the world." "The poor have no power before the rich." "But I saw the Lord in my beloved." "Your elixir was poison to me, O' Lord."

"There are no flowers blooming in our paths." "I left the comfortable lanes." "We stumble and fall into the abyss of sorrow." "And nobody can describe the pain that we face." "Everyone is going out, O' Lord." "I am like a refugee who is thrown out of his city." "I got taunted by the world. But that is fine, O' Lord." "I am like a refugee who is thrown out of his city." Hear me out. Explain to them. I will kill everyone in minutes. That is what I had been doing in the past. Wait, Soldier! Wait. Are you out of your mind, Uncle? I asked him to marry Basant. So kill this rascal first. He wants to bring shame to the family. My sister became a widow at the age of 19. If the poor girl had to be locked inside her house as a widow.. ..that would apparently bring you a lot of honour, right! Isn't it better to marry such a nice man.. ..instead of living alone all her life? Let it be, Teacher! All the women and girls of our village.. ..will go away without even getting married. This is not just your family matter but now, a village affair. - It's about our honour! - What honour do you speak of, Balkar? This is not honour, but torture. Unity is not to terrorise people but to help them. Unity isn't to corner someone. Unity is to save people from being alone. That day also it was torture.. ..the day Basant's widowed mother was married to someone else. And my grandfather, Kashmira Singh.. ..made this girl separate from her mother and stay at home saying that.. ..she was Kashmira Singh's granddaughter.. ..and that she would be raised by him. What honour do you speak of? Well, you are right. People should be happy that someone is settling down. But you should have made it public and got them married. Uncle, Basant was married in her childhood. Had I done it again, would they let me? Wouldn't they question me? And if I had told them the truth and got her married.. ..they would have never let this happen. Saying, her husband just passed away and you are getting her married again. You speak of gathering people, right? They were present the day mother and daughter were separated. Even when you separate the grass from the ground, my soul trembles. You can continue the discussion as much as you wish. But I think this boy has a point. So, Uncle, you suggest what should be done now. Well, we don't have to think about it. Marry the girl and send her off. That's fine. Teacher, at least ask the girl about it. Tell me, dear. What do you want to do? Aunt, how do I leave? That's it. Stop right here, sir. Come, Basant Kaur. Your in-laws' house is here. It seems, the gate is jammed. Hold on, dear. I'm coming. Greetings, Aunt! Did you get the news? She is my mother's sister. She lives next door. She is like a mother to me. - Who are you? - I don't know who I am. You tell me who I am. Tell me.. - Basant! - Yes. My Basant! My dear! "There are stars in the sky." "There are stars in the sky."

It is important in life.. ..that when someone leaves this world.. ..he should always have a smile on his face. Ma'am. Isha, ma'am. - Mom. - Ma'am. - Mom, what happened? - Ma'am. - Wake up. - Ma'am.
