- Guy... ...I know you can hear me. I need you to do something. Guy, you need to trust me. You need to wake up. Oh, uh... Harry... Harry? Harry? Are you there? Come in. Harry? Harry, come back to me. You bugger, Harry! No, no, no, no. Come on, Harry, stop... Don't do this to me. Come on. Motherfuck... Come on, come on, come on, come on. Ah, fuck. Oh, come on, you stupid... Come on, come on. Okay. Okay, okay. Alright. Keep breathing. You can breathe. You can breathe, Guy. Come on. Ignore the dial. Come on. You can breathe, you can breathe. Deep breaths. Come on. Fylingdales... Harry. Harry? Fylingdales? Um, Fylingdales, I'm here. Hermes, are you receiving me? Come in? Um... Harry, I can't... Harry, I can't understand you. You're... you're breaking up too badly. Harry? How do I fix this? Ah, sh... shit! Oh, God. Fucking... fucking Guy.Well done. What are you? What are you? What are you? What are you? Alright. Come on, Hermes. Okay. There we are. Come on. Come on. That's it. Hermes? Come on. Oh, come on. Come on. Shhh-shhh-shhh. I love you, Lottie. That's how... That's how you... That's how you do it. That's... that's not right. That's not right. - ...you there? This is Fylingdales. Are you receiving me? I repeat... ...dales. Guy, you cunt, will you tell me what's happening? - Harry? Harry? Oh, thank Christ. Guy, where the bloody hell were you? - I was, uh, I was taking... taking a flight. It's my day off, Harry. Where... where the helldo you think I was? Where were you? - We thought we lost you when we couldn't raise you. Don't you dare make us go through that again. You frightened us all enough on this flight. - Har-Harry? Is, uh... Is Lottie there? Is... is she with you? - No, she's not in the room right now, Guy. - Um... I... I think I must be losing oxygen. Harry... dial's going crazy. Everything was fine and then, uh... I can't rememberthe last few minutes. What the hell went wrong?H-how do I fix this? - We'll take a look at it, Guy. We lost you just before preflight. No telemetry was received from Hermes till the system's rebooted. Graham and the team are going through everything as quickly as they can to solve this, to find out what's gone awry. There aren't too many options, Guy. I've never seen Graham move so fast. He's breaking a sweat. You'd be impressed. I need you to give us details, Guy. Guy, be specific. - Alright, but... I-I don't fully know... specifics. Uh... the suit vented oxygen. Left me with nothing to breathe.I, uh... ...think... think I blacked out. Um... well, how long did you lose me for? - We had no indication down here that you blacked out. Doc, you reading this? What did Medical say? - Harry?- Hold on, Guy. We'll get an answer for you. - Well... Harry, don't... - We lost Medical when we lost you. It's gonna take them a few to figure that one out. My guess, you were probably out for two minutes; at the most, three. How do you feel? - Three... three minutes? Harry, it... it felt longerthan... three minutes. I... I've lost half my oxygen. I just... I just had to fixthe suit's electrical circuits. That is, if it worked, don't know. Hav... haven't tested it. Actually, I don't knowif I can test it up here. Uh, can you?- We'll check the diagnostics. - How the helldid the suit fail? Hmm? Thought you chapsmeant to test for these things. - I wouldn't want to guess. Not until the team are finished trawling through the readout. Okay... Uh, can you work faster?I'm, uh... struggling to breathe a bit, Harry. Chest feeling really tight. - Guy? - Uh-huh. - I'm slightly worried about what the doctor's telling me. Be aware you may have the beginnings of hypoxia. We need you to act fast on this. First things first. What does your oxygen read? - Uh... it says... 21. Uh, figures 2-1. But I'm currently only breathingthe oxygen in the capsule. - We know, Guy. But that's not going to be enough. It's not designed for long-term life support without the suit. - I'm not intendingto be up here that long. - We'll have to get you more oxygen. Take it easy, slow breaths. Brian's checking the circuits. Hopefully you fixed it. Just breathe easy. Calm and slow. Calm and slow. - You are missing this view, Harry. It's beautiful. You can see everything. Every cloud. Every river. Every... city alightwith life and colour. - Oh, please, do keep on rubbing it in. - I will. Right until the momentyou punch me. Sounds about right. Now, I know you like to slack off, but how about you shoot some film for us? Ready to have that beautiful view to look at. Actually do some work up there. We are looking forward to developing those high-altitude shots you've been taking. - Uh... Six minutes down, four to go. - Good. Take what you can, but don't waste it. - You know, it's a shame... Har-Harry. If you hadn'tchanged your mind... gone back to your desk jobafter all those years of being a... a kerosene jockey... ...you could've beenthe one up here. - I'm not ashamed. Not ashamed at all. I just lost faith in what we were doing and who we were doing it for. I do miss the American RB-45s. Wonderful, that. And how is the wife? - I see you haven't lost your sense of humour up there. - It was always the one thingI couldn't shift. What do you expect, bad influence like you around? - You know what your problem is, Taylor, old boy? You never could take orders from someone unless you respected them and believed in the cause. And that, my friend, is why today, you're up there having all the fun and I'm down here. - It's certainly not fun now. Turns out today isn't my day. You know, I'd rather be flyingthe 45s again with you? Mm, maybe without the Americanstelling us what to do. Looking forwardto a gin-and-tonic in the bar when you get me back.- It's a deal. - Uh, Harry? - Yes, Guy? - Is there a chance I couldspeak with Lottie again? - You spoke with her a few hours ago. You'll have to wait till you land. Don't worry, Guy. - Well, keep me updated. Six hours... 130 miles up, four times around the world. That's enough for me. - Hermes, this is Graham. How are you, Taylor? - Oh, I'm splendid... Graham. I'm, uh... just waiting for youto tell me how to get home. - I've been watching everything carefully, but need you to confirm a few readings before we start. - Roger that. - We're just going through the diagnostics now. It's saying oxygen is at 19 still. 1-9. Is that correct? - Uh, correct. - Good. That seems to be holding steady now. Now, the fuel level. - It says, uh, 30. Figures 3-0. - That's correct. Telemetry is telling me that you are 10° leaning port. Can you correct it? - Uh, Graham, there's noresponse on the control stick. - Ah, right. Um... hold, please. - No, Gra... Graham, don't tell me to hold. If there's a problem, then... then just tell me. - There's nothing we can see on any readouts down here. Hermes still looks good for re-entry. - Oh... Alright. Uh... I really need youto put my wife back on, Harry. - I can't. - Pl-please out her back on. - Not right now. But... we'll try and get her here. - Yes. - Guy? Do me a favour? Check out your flight manual. Page 24. : I'm going up: You got through?! - I did. Harry said yes, so... it's me. - Oh, I'm so happy for you. - For us, Lottie. This is for us. This is the beginning of something bigger. I don't think you know how much. - I know. I've always known. - The first British man in space. The first man in space. Five years as a test pilot and I'm here... at the frontier of science and technology. I'm going up! It's going to be a tough few months. - I know it is, kitten, but you are up to it. You know how tough it was when the Americans had you flying over Eastern Europe. I'll be here with you, by your side. Trust me. Now tell me everything. I want to know. - The launch is scheduled for December 4th. It's a one-day trip. - So you'll be home in time for Christmas, Mr. Spaceman. Yes. : Guy? Guy! You find it? - Yeah, I... I did. When did you put this on here, Harry? - That would be telling. A man has to have his secrets. - Well, you... you are full of them. Thank you. I'll be home soon. - Yes, you will. Guy? - Mm-hmm. - It's time. We're ready to go here after your checks. Three minutes to window. - Roger that. Thrusters... to auto mode: check. Power control to auto: check. Reserve system off: check. Gyro stabilizers off: check. Suit oxygen... ...on: check. Ah, come on. Okay, okay. - Reading you clearly, Guy, we're ready. Hit the switch. - Here... we... go! My God! Shit! Harry? Harry? Oh, God. Uh... hello? Fucking... Come here. Oh, oh. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Come on, Hermes! Come on! No problem.Hermes, come on. Ah. What's that? What is it? What's that? Oh, shit. Come on. Oh, come on, Hermes! Don't... Oh, don't fight me. Oh! Come on! Oh, God! Fuck! Fuck. Oh, come on, Hermes! Come on! Come on, wake up. Please. Come on! Okay. Alright. Okay. That's it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Come on. Easy. Easy. That's it. That's it. That's it. Easy. Easy. Easy. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Fyl... Fyl... Fyling... Fylingdales? Come in. Harry. - Guy, please respond. - This is Mission Control. Taylor, come in. ...Mission Control... Oh... Guy, please respond. This is Mission Control. Taylor, come in! We can't read you. He's not there. Guy, if you're there, please respond. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. - Ah, thank God. Oh, you bastard. Are you alright? What happened? - Something's wrongwith Hermes. I... Ah, my God. It's missing, Harry. Oxygen's still at 19... 19. If you thought puttinga 9G loop was bad, Harry, you... Have a go on this. I feel like I just got offthe bloody... I can't see. - Relax for a moment. Take the time you need to sit and think. The extra in the compartment will be enough for a short while. - Short... How long... is a short while, Harry? Hmm? - Taylor, it's Graham. - Hello, Graham. - What exactly does your fuel readout say up there? - Uh... it's saying... 22. Figures... 2-2. No, not... Uh, Graham, now it's... it's reading 20.Um... - What else happened up there, Taylor? - Well, I can't... You know what, Graham? You tell me! Just get me down from here, fellows. Harry? Harry, what about that, uh, that re-entry window? How much time do we have left? - It's already gone, Guy. - What? No. No, Harry. No, you said I had... - We can't bring you down just yet. Not until we find out what's wrong with the capsule, how it happened and how to fix it. - Well... What? That's not good enough, Harry! Understood. I'm gonna take you off the squawk box, so it's just me. - Okay. Guy, it's just me now. - Huh. Har... Harry, what's going on? What... what are you not telling me? - We're... not really sure what to say at the moment, - Harry... mate, come on. It's me. What's going on? - You know the procedure, the way this works. We can't bring you down. Not after this. Not yet. We're trying everything we can, I assure you. - Well... clearly whateveryou're doing's not good enough! And none of thisshould've happened! - No, but it has. - Hmm. - We are fixing it. Everyone here is working to get you back here safe and sound. - Harry... the problem... is up here. It's not down there. I don't see how you can. - What do you mean? One minute, Guy. Do it. If there's a way, do it. Listen, Guy, Graham's gonna talk you through a procedure we need you to do right now. - Uh, yes. Roger that. - Listen to me carefully. Our systems report you have a fuel leak. Your port thruster has failed. It's probably damaged. The diagnostics appear to indicate the control circuits are fully functional, so we can only presume it's some form of physical damage. - Physical damage? - We need you to shut off the valve for that thruster. - No, what do you mean, physical damage? Graham, you're not listening... Physical damage? How the helldid a thruster fail?! Have you sent me out herewith anything that isn't fucked? - We have our best men going through your telemetry now. Hermes has a million and one parts. This is cutting-edge British technology. It really could be anything. An overload is always in the cards. - Oh, an overload? Just an overload? Is it just a fucking overload, Graham?! That's my fuel supply! First my bloody oxygenand now my sodding fuel! - Guy, you need to trust us. We have a fix. We need you to effect that fix quickly. - Alright. Alright. Ahem. Alright, what do you want me to do? - The panel is down to your left. There are four valves. The second one is for the port thruster. Close it down. - Mm. Ah... Ah, shit. Come on. Graham, it's not... It hasn't worked.It's not working. - Give it a moment. - Okay. Alright. It's, uh... Yeah, it's reading 15. Uh, figures... 1-5. Is that enough to get me home? For re-entry? Chaps? - It will be enough. - Bloody hope so. - What does your oxygen readout say? - It's, uh... ...saying 14. Figures 1-4. So what do I do now? How do I get back? Harry, Harry, Harry, say again.Sorry, I lost you there. You were breaking up. - Can you hear me? We're... - Harry? For godssake. Harry, is that someone elseon the radio? - Someone else? No, there's no one else here. - I can hearsomeone else talking. - Guy, who? Uh... - Can you hear me? - I can now, just about, but... I'm losing you, Harry.- Hold on. Harry! Listen, Harry. Harry, can you hear that? Do you hear that? Guy, is everything alright? - No! No, it's not.Someone else is on the radio! - Guy? Guy, can you hear me? - Harry. Harry... Harry, listen, I can hearsomebody else on the radio, and I can't understand them.I... I think it's Russian. - Guy, did you say Russian? - I... Well, I think so. Ah! - Don't listen to them. Don't listen to anyone. Don't-- - Harry? Harry? Harry, Harry? Hello? Come back, Harry. Harry? Fylingdales? Fylingdales, this is Hermes. Uh... Fylingdales, this is Hermes.Please respond. Fylingdales? Fylingdales, this is Hermes. Please respond. Harry? Graham? Please come in... Um... Fylingdales? No, I can't hear you, but... but, uh... ...maybe you can hear me, so I'm... I'm... I'm gonna keep talking. Um... listen, there's a lot ofinterference and radio chatter that I can't understandand I think... I think it's maybe Russian. And what... what did you mean, don't trust them? Well, how come they're gettingthrough now and you can't? I don't know what to doto get you back on the wire. Alright? So if you're receiving this, find a wayof getting back to me. Right. Um... I realize I'm stuck up here now and I've missedthe re-entry window, but, uh... but my oxygen is down to 14 %. So what the hellam I supposed to do?! Come on, baby, come on. Come on. Come on. It's beautiful, Lottie. - It is. In three days, you will be in Australia, waiting for your launch window. I'll be here, waiting for you to return, watching this very view every day till you come back and tell me everything. - I'm never gonna leave you again after this. You'll be sick of me in no time. - You need not worry so much, Guy. I'll be fine. - Oh, I'm not worried. Not yet. - Yes, you are. Stay focused on what you have to do. Don't worry about me till after you come home. It's important you come home. We need you to come home. If ever you're in danger, or if anything goes wrong, you do whatever you have to do to get back. Don't be stubborn. Let people help you. - If you are going to look at this view, so will I. All you have to do is look out. When the sun shines on you, it shines on me, too. - I can't believe you just said that. Idiot. - I should never have done this. Bloody... cutting-edge British technology, are you, Hermes? Doesn't sound like it. Not exactly filling mewith much confidence. Was it heat expansion? Huh? You warming up again in the sun? How lovely for you. Well, listen, the sooner you're gonna start... ...the sooner we don't haveany more noise like that, huh? Ow. Ah. What? What? Who's... How do you have this frequency? Put me through to Fylingdales. Get off the comms. No, I... I... Hello? Can you hear me down there? Look, I haven't been ableto understand a word. Not a single bloody word.I... I don't speak Russian. No Russian. - No. - No? No? No what? - No understand. - No under... I-I-I... I... no understand... Russian. Please speak English. Anyone therewho can speak English? - English? You English? - Yes. - You must leave Russian territory now. You must abort your orbit immediately. Failure to comply will be treated as an act of aggression. You are orbiting on restricted course, Commander Taylor. How do you know my name? - We... hear... it. Your secret... is not so well kept. You must comply now. Leave Russian airspace. You give us no option but to take action-- - No, who are you? You want... What have you... what have you done with the Fylingdales? You jamming them? - Fylingdales, Commander Taylor... Perhaps you are out of the range for them. - How do you havethis frequency? - We track all radio frequency, especially those over Russian territory. Especially those that threaten the USSR. I'm not over Russia. But you are, Commander Taylor. Although... slightly higher. - No, how do you knowwho I am? Bloody answer me. - Where do you think you are? - What, right now? Hell. - Do not treat me like some fool, Commander. We have been tracking you for past few hours, orbiting air from a small capsule of some sort. We tracked your launch from Woomera, Australia. We did not know where you were till now. We picked up your radio code. This is your fifth time orbiting around the planet. This time, you have deviated from your previous course. Why? - Uh, no, I'm... No, I'm not off my course. No, I-I'm just tryingto get home. Uh, I'm just trying... trying to get back to Britain. Unless... unless you can helpwith that, please, leave the frequency free. - The British are not capable of such feat. We're concerned, Commander. What is your intention, your origin and payload? - Uh... I am British, actually. As for... payload, I don't have... I-I'm the payload. - Lying will not help you. What is your mission? Are you spying for the Americans? The Americans? - You have help from Americans, no? We did not think British would be capable of this. - Oh, you know, I'm goingto take that as a compliment. - You now do what they cannot. I must warn you, Commander, we will retaliate with force. We shall not stand for this deception over Russian territories. - No, I'm... I'm not over Russia! - You are not where you're supposed to be. - Alright, alright.Then where am I? - Your current orbital position is above Tunguska, northern Russia. - Now how can I believewhat you tell me when... you won't believe me? - You can't. - Huh. But, um... If what you're saying is true, then, uh... then I have a problem. - Yes, Commander, you do. - How could I getso far off course? - You tell us, Commander. - I do not see how we can. - I need to talk to my engineersat Fylingdales. I lost contact with themwhen you came through, but maybe you could, uh... patch me through to them? Put me back in touch? - No. This is not possible. - Well, please do something! - No! This is not possible. I cannot do this. My superiors would have me shot for doing what you ask. They already on their way here to talk to you. - Now, listen to me. You-- - I will not be able to communicate for long. - You seem to be a... a... a logical, uh, military type. Yes? Well, then, a few years' experience in, what, in the army? So you know that I'm just doingmy job up here. Well, you must've seen things? Y-you must've been placesyou weren't meant to have been. I'm sufferingmajor malfunctions. I don't know what... statethis ship is in. I'm going to need helpto fix the capsule, but... the longer I stay up here... the less my chances of survival. I just... I just wantto get back home. That's all. Home. You understand? The only way for me to do thatis... is for you to help me. Now... now, will you do that? - I cannot help you. - Is that "cannot,"or "will not"? - You're the only one that can help you. No one else. It's your choice, Comman-- - I don't know how to fix this!- You must do. - Well, I don't!- Commander, you have already surprised us by doing what you've done. Something no one else in the world has been able to do, and seemingly without any help of your beloved allies. - Well--- You must know. - --We, uh... uh, we aim... we aim high. - Too high, by the looks of it. - Oh, fuck. Harry? Harry, where are you, man? Come on, I need you to fix this. I need a plan, I need a plan. - Are you alright, Taylor? - Uh... n-n-n-no, not... not really. I'm... I'm feeling a... I'm feelinga little disoriented and... I don't know, I can't, uh... - Commander? Commander? - Yes. Yes, I'm here. - Take some rest. - Ha. What? I... I can't.I have to get back. I don't... I really don't have time. - How long since you last slept? - Uh... About 38 hours or so. - Maybe you should try now. - Oh, no, I've... I've gone long without sleep. Tell me your name? - Karnov. - It's nice to finally meet you, Karnov. - What do you do if you can't get back? - Uh... Well, I... I don't wantto think about that. No, I... I have to get back. I, uh... I just have to. - Your excursion has attracted a lot of unwanted attention, not only from Tyuratam. You can be assured others will know also. Many people. Many nations will not allow you succeed. You do not belong. You're not meant to do this. Your journey was a secret. This is the way it will stay. They will make sure that it is. - What... what... what do you mean? Ah! Sh... Karnov? Karnov? Karnov, what do you mean? Hello? Ka... Shit! Ah. Bloody helmet. Ah... Well, you've seen better days. Ow, ow, ow, ow. No. No, Lottie, you're right.I, uh... I just need to stay focused. You need to focus, Guy. Hello, Harry. You were... going to give methe flight corrections. So 20-second burn... 12° pitch. That's what it comes down to. Power reserve... shut off. ASCS... Uh... dynamic pressure... ...on. And... landing bag... off. Off. On. Uh... Rear section... breakaway bolts primed and valves closed down. Oh, fuck. Ah, shit! Oh, fucking hell! Um... Argh! Harry, I've, uh... I've just killedmy last chance to get home. Harry, uh... I would've... put Hermesat the wrong angle, been incinera... Fucking hell! Fucking hell. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, God. Jesus... What the fuck? Uh... Oh, God. Oh, God. Jesus! Fuck! What was that?! Oh, shit. Ah! Oh, God. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, God. Uh... Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Come on. Ah, fuck. Fuck, fuck. Oh, God. Come on! That's it. That's it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on. Oh... Ah... Okay. Oh... Ah. Oh, fuck, fuck. What the fuck was that? Okay, okay... let's fo... focus on that. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, you know what, Hermes?! I can tell by the red flashinglight something's wrong! Don't have to shriek at me with that fucking piercing noiseas well! The only purposethat will serve... is for me to open this doorand end it all! Alright?! What am I doing? What the fuck am I doing? Okay. Find the problem, try a fix. So... so... so, uh... that one did... No, that's not... that's not doing it, so... What have we got? Um... Hold. Hold, please.Hold, please. Don't go. Don't go. - You will copy. - I... I copy. Hello, who's... who's there? Please respond. Ah... Argh... I... Fylingdales? Tyuratam? This is Hermes. This is Hermes. Come in.Harry? Hello? - Hermes, this is the United States calling. Are we reaching you? Hermes, please respond. This is the United States. Are you receiving me? - Uh, the United States? - Hermes... we were not sure we could reach you. - Uh, I'm here. I copy. Um... who am I talking to? - Hold your horse there, boy. What do I call you, Hermes? You have a name? - Yes, I have a name. So do you?- Hermes, we've been aware of your course for some time now. You've given us all a surprise down here. The boys at NASA have been calling us all day. Give us your name and the purpose of your mission. - Uh, no, you know the protocol. Identify yourself and, uh, and your interest in me. - I'm Agent Mike Spann, CIA. Hermes, we know you're experiencing problems. We may be able to assist you. - Assist... assist me how? - You've got to give me something first. Name and mission, Hermes. - Alright, well, uh, I assumedyou would've known that I'm... I'm Commander Guy Taylor. Everybody else seems to. Uh, this is a plannedBritish mission, though, as you can probably tell, not everything's goingaccording to plan. And... our circumstanceshave got in the way of us exploring our reach. - That reach is seemingly taking you far off course, Taylor. - Huh. Uh, look,I've lost contact with my engineersat Fylingdales. Anything you chaps down therecan do to put me back in touchwith them, well... it'll be a warm beer on me. We'll try to do what we can, when we can. - When you... Uh, no, I... I'm afraidI need assistance now. Look, the chaps at Fylingdaleswill be able to answer any questions you may haveabout me or my mission. - Why are you in such a hurry, Taylor? - Every minute I'm up hereis a minute far too long. I'm running out of oxygen. I may not be able to speakto you for too much longer, and, uh... we-well, Hermes is damaged. Though I'm surehow bad it is. - Did you say damaged? What's damaged? - Well--- How much air do you actually have left? - Well, I don't know what's, uh, what's damaged exactly. I can't getto some of the circuits. I'm down to, uh, down to 6 % oxygen. After that, there's nothing. And my port thruster's damaged, too, so, uh... I had limited manoeuvrability, so I can't manoeuvre Hermes, and I may... I may wellhave drifted off course. - You're now over U.S. territory. - What, ri... right now? Oh, yes, possibly.I really can't tell. - We understand you've been making new friends. Why you been talking to the Russians? - Sorry? - We have been monitoring your communications, and you were and have been speaking with the Russians. - Uh, no, they spoke to me.- Same difference. Well, I beg to differ. They wanted to case meout of their airspace. - Is that all they wanted? - Well... you interceptedthe transmissions. Translate them yourself. - As you'd expect, we're already working on that. - Perfect. - Why aren't in contact with the British? Are you a Commie, Taylor? It's been a few years since I hunted Commies. - A Commie? Are you... Look, do... do I have to remind you that I'm a British officer? I'm an ally. I'm just tryingto get back home. - So you were bring helped by the Russians. - You know, I wouldn't say helped, no. They were worse than useless. Rather like you now. I don't likeyour line of questioning. - Look, Taylor... we're unclear to what your intentions actually are. Especially as... um... according to this... you used to spy for us. You were part of our inner circle. We know everything about you, Taylor. I've just been handed your file. Oh, and I have a picture of you and your lovely wife. She is beautiful. You worked for us spying over Russia in '54, did you not? Handpicked, as well. You obviously have some skill in the air. How did you find flying our RB-45s? Nice aircraft, aren't they? A bit heavy on the rudder, I found, although I haven't had as many hours in them as you. According to your file, on several occasions, you flew over Russia on photo-reconnaissance for us on Operation Jujitsu. Our records indicate 16 times. And by my reckoning, it's impressive you weren't shot down. - No, what I did for you guys... in 1954... is long over. And anyway, I only didwhat my superiors ordered me to, because your pilots didn't wannarisk their own bloody asses. - But, sure, Taylor, you understand why we are a little worried about you talking to the Russians. You seem to be making a habit of talking to anyone but your own people. Are you fraternizing with the enemy? What?! No! - We are at war, Mr. Taylor. - No, we're not. No one's at war with anyone. Certainly not me up here. - What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you read the papers over there in England? We're all at war with the Russians! We trust you Limeys. Your mission is still unclear to us. I would be inclined to suggest that your intentions towards the United States could be considered as hostile, and therefore will be treated as such. - Hostile? Are you pulling my leg? - Pulling your what now? - Hostile actionis the last thing on my mind. I just wanna get home. I just needto know how to first. Now, that's my intention. I... I... I promise you, that's my only intention. - Did you share these intentions with the Russians? - Oh, forget aboutthe fucking Russians! Have you made contactwith Fylingdales? - I'm not at liberty to discuss communications. What... ...even with my own people? My God, it's gettingbloody cold in here. - Why would that be? - I, uh... I had to sacrifice my heatersto get back control. - I see. Then it will get real cold real quick. - Agent Spann... ...I need you to help me. I'm down to 5 % oxygen. And with the malfunctions, I don't know how longthat will last. If you don't... ...the most likely outcome is that I crash landin your back garden. - Was that meant as a threat, Taylor? - Of course not! Don't be so bloody paranoid! It's not a threat. It's... just a... ...it's a realitythat will come true if I don't initiatere-entry procedure... and get back in touchwith Fylingdales. - We would've hoped that Britain would've shared this mission with us. For crying out loud, you've launched a man into space. - Ah, well - ahem -you can't... you can't always getwhat you want, can you? - You feeling okay, Taylor? - You almost sound concerned. - I am concerned. We believe the combination of lack of air and your advancing coldness will almost certainly affect your capabilities. So how's about concentrating for me, will you? - I am... concentrating. As much as I sensibly can. - Listen... Taylor. We are willing to help you, but need you to do something for us. We will effect a safe re-entry if you land in a designated area of our choosing. That way, we can intercept you, bring you here for safety. If you're not a Commie, why are you even thinking about this? You get home, we find out the truth... Everyone wins. Are you there, Taylor? - Yeah, I'm... I'm here. Just... - You have an answer for me, Mr. Taylor? - Let me speak with Harryat Fylingdales? - No, I can't do that. - I have to talk to Harry. Uh... that's my condition. Without that, I-I'm, uh... I'm unwillingto accept your offer. - We can effect a safe re-entry. As far as I can tell, you do not have any further options. It's time to get off the fence and do something. You're either with us... or against us. Which is it, Taylor? - You haven't exactlyleft me much choice. Alright, where do you want meto land? - Atlantic Ocean. Our Navy craft, the USS Borie, will meet you there. She's already been deployed to the area. She'll be there to pick you up when you splash down. - So what... what happens now? - I'm gonna put you through to one of my colleagues at NASA, Bob Elijah. He's eager to talk to you about some calculations he has run to work your problems. - And that... that's it? - Of course, Taylor. Now I have your assurance you're gonna do what I ask. - Mm.- Good luck. - Hermes, this is Houston. Are you receiving me? - Houston, Houston... this is... this is Hermes. Uh, I-I-I'm receiving you. Bob, is it?- Yes. Yes, it is. Nice to meet you, Commander Taylor. - Guy, please.Please call me Guy. - Copy that. I've been advised I'll be taking you through the procedure for the re-entry based on calculations I've made. I'm not quite up to speed with the Hermes' design. There will be a few assumptions on my part, so please forgive me. - Roger that. Uh, wh-wh-what do you need meto do? - Let's start with your fuel levels, Guy. - Uh... reading... ...10.Figures 1-0. - Alright, noted. I-I'm 4 % oxygen, Bob. Can we speed this up a bit? It's... getting rather coldin here. - Alright, I'll try to cut this down to bare minimum. - Roger that. - Everything from here on out will be time critical. - Right. Understood. Minus 466. - Uh... minus 12.321. 9.418. 1 minute, 10 seconds. Minus 113, burn for 60 seconds. Roger that. Um... A-a-are you sureI should be planning to burn... for 60 seconds, Bob? - You have a problem with that? - Uh... I don't know. I... No, no. You know... It all seems to be in order. - Taylor, are you ready? 20 seconds. Ten seconds mark. This is it, Guy. Let's bring you home. - Ah... - Roger that. 60° starboard roll. - You need to lock down the thrusters. The tracking data looks good, Guy. - I'm at the correctorientation. - Guy, that's perfect. Now, on my mark, 10-second burn in... three... two... one. Mark. - Bob?! Houston, Houston, come in. Come in, come in, Bob! - ...number and input-- - If you can hear me, thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Bob? Houston? Hello? Hello? You've broken up, Bob. I'm sorry... Thank you. Thank you. Come in! Hermes, Guy, come in! Please! - Harry?- We can hear you. We're here. You went out of range. We tried through Honduras, but their transmitter wasn't powerful enough to get to you. You're far off from where we expected. You were drifting over Russia. - The Russians saw me, Harry.And they weren't too pleased. I think th-they may even haveattacked me with something. God knows what. - Where are you now? What are you doing? - I-I've startedre-entry procedure and... and the Americans... the Americans helped me. Americans? No, Charlotte, no, no, no. - Let me through. - What are you doing? - I'm allowed to do this. - You can't be in here now. You have to go. - Guy? Guy! - Charlotte, you have to leave. Get out of here! - No! No, Harry! Let her speak! Please, mate, let her... let her be here. Just let her be here.Just... just for a moment. I... I won't take long, I promise. I... I just need to... I need to speak to her. I-I-I need to hear her. Please? - Fine, but just a moment. You've got one minute. - I'm worried. Are you alright, Guy? You're breathing heavily. - Lottie, darling, I'm fine. I'm fine. I-I-I-I'm alright.I'm fine. You know... things have been better, but, uh.... b-b-b-but please don't worry. - I love you, Guy. I always did love you. - Don't... Ah, you're gonna make me cry, Lottie. - Sorry. - No, no, no, no. No. No, don't... don't be. I-I've waited far too longto hear your voice. - I need you. - I need you, too. I've pictured you, you know? I've pic... I've pictured your face. Y-y-you've been here with me. You've been here the whole time, by my side. Lottie? Darling? I can do this. Ha-Harry will tell youthat I'm coming home. Won't you, mate? Lottie? Lottie, you know that I love you. - I love you, too. Goodbye. - No. Not goodbye. Never goodbye.Just... I'll see you soon. : Guy, are you there? Where did they say you're going to land? - Uh, uh, the... the Atlantic somewhere. I don't know. They said the, uh, uh, the... the USS Borie. The USS Borie is gonna comeand pick me up. - Atlantic? You're over Russian right now. - No, no, no, that's wrong, Harry. I-I must be over the Atlanticsomewhere. Ha-Harry? - I've been on the wire with the Americans since we lost you. You can't be speaking with them. - Oh, God. I-I thinkI'm entering the atmosphere. - Guy? Guy, can you hear me?! Guy, say again. Who have you been talking to? Guy, who have you been talking to?! Guy, can you hear me? Guy, are you there? Guy, please come in. Can you hear me? Oh, my God. - Makharov. : Harry? Oh, God. I think I'm entering the atmosphere. Oh, God. Shit! Was it that? What...? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?! It's a fucking American craft! Hermes is severely damaged. I'm getting warning lights all over the dashboard. I'm in the upper layers of the atmosphere It's getting unbelievably hot in here now. Something isn't right. It's not coming down! Nothing's happening! This shouldn't be happening! My parachutes haven't deployed! I'm frightened.
