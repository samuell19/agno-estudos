Change of plan. We've put off our visit to the grotto until tomorrow. I'm sorry. Our journey was rather tiring, we'd all been looking forward to this, but it's too late now. So tomorrow, our schedule will be even busier. This is why I ask you all to make an effort, so that we can get everything done, in a cheerful manner and, more importantly, so that we can open up to one another. Each one of us should make the most of this opportunity. We, the helpers, but of course you, the pilgrims. You came here to help foremost those of us who are sick, those who are in need. They shall feel better, even if only for a few days. They shall forget their loneliness and find some happiness and relief here. At the end of our stay, we'll award a prize for the best pilgrim, as a reward for their good deeds. Information about Lourdes and the apparitions can be found in this booklet. Are you enjoying it? Yes. It's a bit touristy, but that's how every pilgrimage is. Have you been on many? Yes. It's the only way I get out. Travelling isn't easy in a wheelchair. You take the legs. One, two, three... Look here. The wheelchair, please. All right? A bit higher. That's fine, thanks. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Goodnight. Do you like her? Beautiful, isn't she? The Virgin Mary is watching us. Don't forget your raincoats. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and he whom John baptised in the Jordan, your child Jesus, is blessed. Thank you. Well, are you pleased to be going in? I guess so. They say that the last healing occurred in the baths. What happened exactly? There was a man who'd suffered from multiple sclerosis for years. Apparently, it was in the baths that he suddenly recovered the use of his arms and legs. That's how he was cured. Yes. I'd heard about that too. Sorry to butt in, but it didn't happen exactly as you said. Firstly, it happened at the blessing, not in the baths. And secondly, his paralysis came back later. The poor thing! That's why it wasn't officially recognised as a miracle. He did walk again, though? Yes, but it didn't last. So it doesn't count. They're very strict about that. Next! What if the healing does last? It'll be all right. It'll do you good. You'll see. You're next. Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us. Saint Bernadette, pray for us. O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us. Lord, I have come here for a little comfort and human warmth. Usually, I am alone. I pray that I receive some care and attention here. Lord, hear our voices raised in prayer. Lord, my fiancée left me after my motorbike accident. Let me find a new fiancée who's better able to handle my disability. Lord, hear our voices raised in prayer. Lord, I sometimes feel that my life is passing me by. I feel useless. Please help me. Lord, hear our voices raised in prayer. Hear our voices. Lord, stay with us For it is toward evening We're going for a drink later. Want to come? Maybe. I bet Kuno will come too! We'll see. Well, are you enjoying yourselves? Yes. We met on the trip to Rome... didn't we? Yes, of course. Well, enjoy yourself. Thanks. In fact, I rather prefer the cultural trips. Everywhere is different. Yes. Do you want some Lourdes water? No, thanks. Excuse me, father. - May I ask you something? - Of course. I've heard that one can be healed even physically here. It does happen... Miraculous healing. Yes. I want to ask you... What do I have to do? I believe, of course, that God can perform miracles. But only if we open our hearts fully to His grace. We must say, "Yes, " to Him. And what exactly must we do? Firstly our souls must be healed. Only then can the body be healed. I felt a bit lost at first. But now I enjoy the volunteer work. And it's for a change. Usually I go skiing during the holidays. But sometimes I miss the meaning behind it. Contrary to charity work. It's important to me to have a goal, or meaning in my life. Are you all right? What's happened? - What's the matter with her? - I don't know. It's upsetting. The tide buries us all in the end. You gave us quite a scare. I'll handle this. Sorry. Don't worry about it. That's fine. Thanks. And the prayer? Sorry. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Oh, sorry. Not behind the ear. There. - Do you like it? - And the earrings? Yes. Did you have fun last night? Good morning. Careful, it's hot. - Good morning. Are you well? - Yes, thanks. Is everything all right with you too? Do you like it here? I had a strange dream. I dreamt that I was paralysed and that the Virgin Mary appeared to me. She said something, but I didn't understand very well what she said. So I got up and moved closer. And it was then that I realised I was no longer paralysed. It's not easy, I know. But we must learn to accept our fate with humility. We pray for the healing of the soul, not that of the body. And the suffering you bear can have a deep meaning. Paul said, "I rejoice in my suffering for your sake, "and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions "for the sake of His body, that is, the Church. " If I told you what I dreamt about last night! Do you think he's married? Who cares? During the blessing there have been healings, too! You're going too far now! Not at all! When the priest passes with the sanctum and he stops to bless them, sometimes people are healed. Don't believe all you're told. We'll see. Here she is, the eager one! But it won't do you any good. Do you really think God would heal someone just because they pushed in front of the others? In future, please don't move away from the rest of the group. - Was it fun last night? - She doesn't remember! Stop it! - The girls have got to you. - Of course they have! - Shall we go? - Yes. - Goodbye. - Your hat. I suggest you concentrate more on your duties. We're not here to have fun. Where have you been? Are you glad to be here? It was lovely, wasn't it? The blessing was lovely, don't you think? Yes, it was fine. Thanks. Are you feeling all right? Yes. You're all pale. I'm always pale. Wait! I'll give you a hand. - Thank you. - That's what I'm here for. - It's really nice of you. - No. I have to atone for my sins. Let us pray to the Lord not to despair in the face of death. May we see the grave for what it truly is: an in-between place, where we leave our mortal bodies. We shall now move on to the Station of the Resurrection, for this is the truth of Christianity: eternal life. Everyone was praying devotedly, repeating the words spoken by the priest. I was exhausted and feIt unweIl, so I couldn't pray any more. I concentrated instead on a single thought: "Lord, may Thy will be done. "Virgin Mary, pray for us. " Suddenly, I felt a bolt flash through me from my head to my feet. Like an electric shock. I thought it was the end. But no, I was kneeling in front of my wheelchair, upright, with my hands together. I don't know what happened but I knew that I was cured. The pain was all gone. And my limbs, which had been paralysed and flaccid, were full of renewed strength. - Did you notice anything? - What? The man who'd had the miracle, he was sitting down. Yes, so? We didn't see him get up once. Doesn't that make you think? Don't you think we might get lost? The Holy Ghost, Jesus and the Virgin Mary are on a cloud, discussing their holiday plans. The Holy Ghost says, "Let's go to Bethlehem. " Jesus says, "Bethlehem? No, we've been there lots of times. " The Holy Ghost thinks and says, "Then how about Jerusalem?" Jesus says, "Jerusalem? No, we've been there lots of times. " The Holy Ghost thinks and says, "I've got it! "Let's go to Lourdes. " The Virgin Mary says, "Yeah, great! "I've never been there before!" This morning you have free time. You can choose between confession and going to the baths. Benefit from this opportunity. We'll meet at two o'clock by the Basilica of the Rosary, for the photograph. Be on time. - The napkin. - Oh, yes. Sorry. I dreamt about you last night. The Virgin Mary appeared to you and said something to you. What did she say? "Rise, take up your bed and walk. " So, is Lourdes better than Rome? Let's just say that Rome is somehow... more cultural. You're right. I prefer Rome too. Do you prefer confession or baths? We could do both. Our time is limited. Do you mind if I don't come with you? You can't just leave her! I'll be back! I am often angry. Why did I fall ill and not someone else? Why me? Sometimes I envy the others, those who can walk and do everything normally, without thinking. There are some worse off than me, but I don't feel any pity for them. I'd like to be healthy too and have a normal life. What is that? A "normal life"? Your life is unique. Each life is unique. God created this diversity. Each life is different, none is better than another. Or do you think that someone who can use his legs is necessarily happier? Let us pray together. Lord, we pray to You. Heal this young woman. Heal her soul. And, if You wish, heal her body too. Excuse me. Sorry. - Lucky! - That was close. I hope that this time I'll get rid of my eczema. - Our Lady of Lourdes. - Pray for us. - Saint Bernadette. - Pray for us. O Mary of the immaculate conception. Pray for us, poor sinners. Anna? Anna. A miracle? Anna! - What's going on? - No idea. It's a miracle. Mum. Excuse me. Sorry. Hold it, ladies and gentlemen. On three, give me a smile, please. One, two, three... Thank you. Have a nice day. Let's go. ... heal also your servant from the infirmity of body and spirit that afflicts him. Amen. Holy Father, doctor of souls and bodies, you who sent your only begotten son Jesus Christ to cure every disease and to free us from death, heal also your servant from the infirmity of his body and soul that afflicts him. Amen. Holy Father, doctor of souls and bodies, you who sent your son Jesus Christ to cure every disease and to free us from death, heal also your servant from the infirmity of body and spirit that afflicts him. Amen. For our last day, there will be an excursion into the mountains. We shall go up the Pic du Jer. I'm sorry, but only the most able-bodied of you will be able to come. Those in wheelchairs must stay here. Our closing party, on the other hand, is open to everyone. Are you allowed? Yes. It's whipped cream. - More? - Yes. - You look so healthy today. - Thank you. Enjoy. I'd like a little more. Sorry to bother you... Could you help me prepare things for the party? Of course. What would you like to do? I'd like to put a paper chain over there, and maybe over there too. And a few balloons. Fine. When? After the meal. I'll finish my pudding and be right with you. Thank you. Father, I have something to ask you. Is God good or is He all-powerful? If He's all-powerful and good, He could heal everyone, couldn't He? He does. But for some it's more discreet. It's on the inside, you see? Take a person in despair, for example, who suddenly, through God's grace, finds a meaning to life. That too is a miracle. If you like. - A bit lower. - Sorry. Thank you. Cécile... Can I help you? It's hot! Could you, just a little... ? Congratulations. From me too. Have you been to the medical office? No. You ought to, or it won't be officially acknowledged. How sad that Miss Cécile can't see this. We must give thanks to the Virgin Mary. And pray that it lasts. She's the one it happened to. It's a miracle! We're here for a very important reason. We have reason to believe that this young woman, contrary to all expectations, has been cured. But we are not sure. What should we do in such a case? You're not the only ones today. Next, please. This patient's ailment goes through phases of intensification and remission. Multiple sclerosis has its ups and downs, and this would seem to be a temporary improvement of her overall state, which will not last. Will you stand, please? Carry on, carry on... Come back. Very good. Be careful. You should get some rest. Your body needs to readapt itself. Above all else, get plenty of fresh air. Now what do we do? This case will have to go before a medical committee. Such an improvement is most uncommon. It's extraordinary. Goodbye and good luck. Thank you. In fact, it happened gradually. I could feel something in my hands after the baths. Then, in the grotto, I could lift my hand to touch the rocks, whereas I couldn't even lift a finger before. After the baths? That's interesting. Continue. During the night I heard what sounded like a voice, telling me to get up. So I got up and went to the toilet, as natural as can be. As if I suddenly remembered what to do. Like looking for your glasses when you're wearing them! But what about inside yourself? Do you feel a sort of illumination? Not really. Do you think that makes a difference? It depends. On what? Let's say that it depends on the way you internalise this healing. One may wonder whether it will reinforce your faith and make your attitude an example for all Christians. In view of the circumstances, some of you have requested that we retake the group photo, as a way of, let's say, capturing this great event. So I would like to see you all tomorrow after breakfast by the Basilica of the Rosary. For the helpers... We are now going to go to the little chapel. We've decided to hold a novena on behalf of our Cécile, who is still, unfortunately, between life and death. One, two, three... Hold it, I'll take another. On three again. One, two, three... Thank you. Have a nice day. How are you? Still feeling well? Yes, fine. So much the better. Yes. You're not on the list. She's coming instead of Cécile. Cécile... Carré... I want to start a career as soon as possible. I have the feeling great things are in store for me. You know... I really feel that I have a future now. Of course. I wish you success. Thank you. Or you could have a family. That's possible now, isn't it? Yes. That's true. - Do you need a hand? - No, thanks. I'm pleased for her. She's made such an effort. I wonder why her, and not... I don't know, let's say... Mr Hruby? Why Mr Hruby? Or the girl in the wheelchair. Her mother comes here every year. That's not what counts, obviously. Yes, doing too much doesn't help either. That's for sure. Just look at what happened to Cécile. She was at it non-stop. Yes, but Mrs Carré pulled her weight too. She doesn't seem very pious, our miracle girl. Sorry to bother you, father. But I'd like to ask you something we're all wondering about. Why has she been cured and not... Mr Hruby, let's say? God is free. His ways are often mysterious to us, when we expect everything to be explained. Why is this person cured and not another? That's the way life is. One person can play the piano, another can't. One has a gift for languages, another doesn't. One is rich, another is not. Thank you. Are you all alone? I'm thinking. All of this is... very... It bothers me. Skiing must be great here in winter. I'm looking forward to skiing again. She'll have to come to terms with it too. You're very special. Really? Really. Getting up like that and walking. How did you do it? I'm so... I'd so like to... I'm scared of hurting you. One, two, one, two. One, two. May the Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Something miraculous has happened. God has sent us a powerful sign, a sign of His grace and His love. We can see it with our own eyes. Heaven has reached down to earth. And what does this tell us? That God has not forsaken us, that He is always watching over us, that He loves us. Through this sign He has manifested His presence. He is telling us, "You are not alone. " Thank you very much. I am very grateful. This is an honour for me. I am also grateful for the grace, that I was the one to be cured. It's given me something to think about. Why me and not... ? But I think there's meaning to it. Well... For me, anyway. What I mean is, I hope to be the right person. I am happy to award you the prize for the year's best pilgrim. It's been good, though, hasn't it? Yes, but tomorrow I'll be alone again. We are not alone. We are. - Do you want to dance? - Yes. I'm so happy. Are you all right? Yes. - Do you want your stick? - No, thanks. Come and sit down. No, I'm fine. I don't need it. - I'll be right back. - OK. A pity. I almost believed it. What do you mean? She tripped, that's all. Just imagine if it doesn't last. That would be so cruel. How can God do that? If it doesn't last, then it wasn't a real miracle. So He is not in charge. Who is, then? Do you think there'll be a dessert?
