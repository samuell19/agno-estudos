Yeah, you did. - Three times on the way - to the airport and then twice on the plane. Trying too hard again, huh? Just a little bit. The beach where we'll be living looks amazing. We could learn to surf. - I've always wanted - to try surfing. - It's gonna be great - to spend more time with you... without all the other pressures. You okay, honey? Yeah... just like the last three times you asked. - -You're doing it again. - -I know, I know. I'm trying too hard. It's okay. I love you for it. I'm fine. I just really wanna get the bags and get to the apartment. [Sarah] It shouldn't be long now. - [baggage claim officer] - Good news is, we found them. Bad news is, they weren't taken off the flight during stopover, and they're on their way to Melbourne. The next flight back isn't due to arrive for a few hours. - But I'll personally make sure - that they deliver to your residence first thing in the morning. Hi, welcome to Adelaide. - -Finally. - -Thank you. Oh. Mom, we're in Australia. They drive on the other side of the road. I knew that. [car engine starts] -Mom, left-hand side! -Oh! [Sarah] Whatever you do, do not hit the kangaroos. Hey, you missed me. I'm Down Under, not vaulting up and over anymore, so... - [sighs] - This is stupid. Hey, it's Kelly. You missed me. I'm Down Under, so leave a message. No likes, no friends... nobody except-- - [Sarah] - Kelly? [sighs] Well, at least unpacking was easy. How about we take in the local sights? Why not? It's been a while since it was just the two of us. Let's go party. We could learn to surf. [together] I've always wanted to try surfing. [giggling] [pop song playing over tablet] ♪ No need to worry ♪ ♪ 'Cause these are just moments in time ♪ ♪ So don't be in such a hurry ♪ You are gonna tighten your tie, right? You gotta make a good impression on your first day. Yes, Mrs. Johnson. It's a good school. You'll make friends in no time, I'm sure. Okay. Come on. Don't wanna be late. [turns off music] - [Sarah] - Jacket. [Sarah] Notice anything different about what they're wearing? Mom, seriously, on my first day? [laughing] So you're sure you don't want me to come in? Think I'll stick with the wrong uniform and skip the mom escort. Don't wanna use up all my embarrassment on the first day. - I'll be working late - at the hospital. -You have the bus pass? -Mom. Uh, of course you do. Have a good day, honey. Like there is any chance of that happening. No. Mom, other, other side. [car honking] [sighs] - -You must be Kelly. - -Hi. I'm Miss Saranti, deputy principal. - Let's get you - to your first class and do a quick tour as well. Uh, yes, ma'am. Thank you. You know, dear, that's the wrong uniform. That's the winter one, although you just have come from winter, haven't you? Yes. Jessica, why aren't you in class? My mum went back to hospital, and I missed the bus. And I had to finish copying these flyers. [Saranti] Yes, I heard about your mum. I'm sorry to hear that. But if you're late, I need you to be in class straight away. Alright? You can do that later. Please excuse me. Girls, why aren't you in class? That's the wrong uniform. Thanks, I got the memo now. American? Hm. Gymnastics. You're... into that? Yeah. The elite program here. -Um, your mom not well? -She's fine. -Oh, I-I just-- -You were wrong. She's fine. - [Saranti] - Jess, this is Kelly. Could you please escort her to Miss Matzel's class? And that will be enough of that eye-rolling, thanks. Yeah, so I got out of the car I turned to wave... and then I just, I tripped on the step my heel caught my skirt. Oh, it was so embarrassing, I went down flat on my face. So it's like... watching you vault minus the sprained wrists? I told you, that vault was broken! - [Miss Matzel] - Enough, Nic! Turn around, face the front. Get your books out, too, please, Nic. Now, Nic. [scoffs] - [Scotty] - You okay, there? Yeah, I'm fine, just, uh... hanging out... with my bag. Just relaxing. Getting comfy. Okay. So there are two things. - Great job of convincing me - that's comfy but it's probably not and, second, that's not your bag... it's mine. Hm, are you sure? I mean, they all look the same. Pretty sure. It's got my name on it. See? Oh, there. Guess you really like that spot. Now I've got a problem. What? I, I, I didn't take anything. Good to know, but that's not the problem. The problem is you know my name but I don't know yours. Oh. Uh, it's, it's Kelly. Kelly Johnson. Dude, where are you? We're starting. 'Sup? Well, I should go. But it was nice to meet you, Kelly. Kelly Johnson. It's, it's nice to meet you, too. Scotty, Scotty... I... don't know your last name. [chuckles] Hey, you're the new girl. - You know that's - the wrong uniform for this time of year, right? Yup, I've heard. I'm Nicola, but everyone calls me Nic. Hi, I'm Kelly. Wait. Say that again. What? I-I'm Kelly. You're American! Oh, I love your accent! -Say more things. -What? Oh, just say more things, so I can hear you talk. Uh... apple pie? -Uh... blizzard... -Oh... Pillow fight, banana... -You're funny! -Thanks. - -Um, this is my first day here. - -Oh, really? Well, well, where are you from? Why are you here? - Well, how long have you - been here? Why, why at the gymnastics... Do you do gymnastics? - -Uh... - -Oh, it's so exciting. - -I'm from Atlanta. - -Mm-hmm. [Kelly] Uh, I'm here with my mom for a year. - She's a surgeon - at the City Hospital. I, I do... Well, I-I did gymnastics. Oh, well, um, if you don't do gymnastics then... why be here? Um, I'm just sorta used to being in a gymnasium. Kinda feels like home. I don't really have any friends, so... Well, now you do. So if you've done lots of gymnastics before maybe you could help me out a bit then, yeah? - -Help you out? - -Yeah. I wanna get good enough to make the elite squad. Well, you looked pretty good on the trampoline. I mean... Yeah, well, until I fell on my face. Well, my dad is a gymnastics coach - so I might be able - to help a little bit. Really, a coach? Yeah, but let's not get into that right now. Okay. Sure. [pop music playing] Okay, spread your arms. Like that? Is it better? [indistinct chatter] Okay. Ow! Ow! [indistinct chatter] Have a great day. Oh, my... That's great. Anyway, um, so what's the deal - with the other girls - on the team? I think I met... Jess. - -Jess? - -Yeah. Jess is basically a jerk. You know what I mean? - Jess is on a sports scholarship - to Floruit. She's a year older than us, finishes school this year and easily one of the best gymnasts around here and sort of the... queen of her year. - She lives just with her mother - and grandmother like, this tiny, little place up north. - Actually, I think everybody's - a bit scared of her. I mean, I am. She's very motivated to win a US gymnastics scholarship 'cause I think it's her only chance to go to university. - She won't be able - to afford to go here. 'Cause you're from the US, you two might have a lot in common. Not my first impression. Uh, I don't think she liked me - within the first five seconds - of meeting me. Yeah, she can be pretty scary when she wants to be... which is always. - She works part-time - at a fish and chips shop - and I went there once - with my parents. My dad made me ask her for some vinegar. It was so weird. Oh, and she has a bit of history - with one of the guy gymnasts, - Scotty. You perhaps saw him training at the gym. Then there's Ashley. She envies Jess, like, huge, like... And is Jess' right-hand girl. They've been friends for years, but, really, they're frenemies. Like, Ashley's a good gymnast but she just doesn't have Jess' talent - so she can't quite get - to be the head girl so she has to settle for the next best. There's a bit of jealousy there. I think I know what that's like. Sam is an ex-rhythmic gymnast. Um, stuck with it for years. - She never really quite got - the rhythmic stuff. She just kept dropping the ball, and getting tangled and... Dropping the ball and getting tangled? Yeah, literally. Like, great lines, flexible, strong but she couldn't quite grasp the extra co-ordination needed. - Her coach said - she should try artistic. - Sam's easy-going, - like, always be nice but she's in Jess' elite little group nowadays and... Oddly enough, she's turned into a really good netballer, as well. Netball? What's that? Oh, it's a way big hit. It's like basketball but you don't run with the ball. Then what do you do with it? Score goals, of course! I'll take you to a game at some stage. Then there's the boys. Justin, really good gymnast doesn't attend Floruit. - He was in an elite program, - but quit. He likes performing and singing. He's pretty good, too. He juggles doing gym, singing and acting lessons and I think he might even be part of a band. Not sure. I call him Biebs. -Why? -Biebs. Justin. -Beiber. -Oh, right. Makes sense. Got it. Uh, what about the other guy? Uh... Oh, Scotty. Plays heaps of sports. He's a Floruit. Um, he's a little bit shy for me. Rich parents, too, but he's a really nice guy. - Jess and Scotty - had a thing going for a while. - -What? - -Mm. - [Nicola] - Yeah, they broke up last year. But I reckon she's still sort of keen on him though. But he doesn't like her anymore, right? I'm just asking so that I know the lay of the land and everything. You did hear what I said about Jess, yeah? And for the record, she broke it off. She didn't want any distractions. Then there's Luke. He's cool. Doesn't attend Floruit. Um, Luke's brothers and sisters have all been in gymnastics. His sister was an awesome gymnast - but she's overseas, - studying now... - [Nicola] - Kelly? - -Hello? - -Hi. -Yeah, sorry. Here. -Oh, my God. Uh, hey, so what's, what's your story? -What are you all about? -Oh. Best part, you see - I was a trampolinist, - but I wanted a change. See, I always wanted to do artistic gymnastics - but because - I've come into it late - I don't really have the control - like the others. - That's why - I'm in the seconds gym trying to get as much training as I can. - Well, that's what - Jess told me to do. She keeps describing me as, like, out of control - which, I mean, I just don't get, - like, what does she mean? Hm. I can't imagine. Hm. Hey, Kel. So how was your day? You mean, besides wearing the wrong uniform all day? Was it that bad? - [sighs] - No. I'm sorry. There's just some posts online. Do you want me to beat up somebody for you? It depends. How quickly can you get to Atlanta and back? Hey, you have that photo from back home on there. It's a nice shot. - You used to have - that other picture - with your father - coaching you at the gym as your background. - Always used to make me - feel a bit jealous when I saw that picture. Really? Yeah. I, I deleted that. Not happy memories at the moment. Listen, Kel. I know this trial separation is hard on you... but coming here is a circuit breaker for all of us. We needed it. Yeah, I know. I get it. - Maybe you wanna - go back with your dad. Mom, no. I wanna be here with you. Really. I made a friend today. Nic. She's, she's really great. She's funny. You'll like her. That's great, honey. I knew you would make friends quick. I, uh... met Nic at the gym. I-I told her I would help her out with gymnastics. Define help out. Well, I think I sorta told her that I had done a little bit of gymnastics and I might have mentioned that my dad was a gymnastics coach. So I told her I could... probably help her out a little bit. Right. Wait one second. My championship leotard? I thought you might be needing it again. Thanks, Mom. Okay, what is going on? Every time you jump up, you have a different arm movement. I just go with the flow. - You know, I wanna - add to the move, you know? I don't wanna be stuck with a rod up my back. I wanna be free. Women's artistic gymnastics. Free? I mean, this whole sport is about precision. Doing the same move, the same way, the right way every single time. You've gotta get serious. You seem serious enough for the both of us and the rest of Floruit. - -I have to work on that. - -Okay. How about you just watch me for one second? - -Okay? - -Okay. Yeah. Alright. -Just do exactly what I do. -Yeah. - [Kelly] - Okay. Wow, you are good! - Alright, now at the end - of your move try finishing it off nicely. Present yourself. -Oh! -Oh! I am so sorry. - Well, I should've been watching - for spinning students. So, do you gym? Uh, yeah, I, I do. -I mean, I, I used to. -Her dad's a coach. - Well, I might see you - on the floor then. Or maybe you won't see her - and she will - knock you down again. -Thanks, Nic. -Shh, don't distract me. I'm practicing. ♪ Ah ah ♪ ♪ Ah-ah ah ah ah ♪ ♪ Ah ah ♪ Guys. ♪ Ah-ah ah ah ah ♪ Hey. - Um, we're gonna have - a little mini comp against the boys, and Jess isn't at training. So how about joining? - -Where's Jess? - -Oh. Family or work stuff, I think. - -Sounds fun? - -Yeah. Let's go. No, not you, just Kelly. What? We need one extra. Just you. - I don't think so. - I think I'll pass. No, no, no. You go, Kelly. Yeah, you show them. I mean, you really show them. Let's go. Go, Ash. Whoo! Go, Kelly! [all cheering] Go, Kelly! Oh, my God! You're amazing! You go, girl. Okay. And the scores are girls, 72.5 thanks to Kelly's 14 on her buzz. Pretty good for someone not competing, I might add. Boys, 76. -Yeah! -Come on! Super impressive, Kelly. - I'd like to have you - on the team. You interested? Thank you, I really appreciate the offer but I'm not looking to compete right now. Are you sure? Y-you have so much talent. I'm sure. Nic is really desperate to join the team, though. I mean, she would benefit from the better training - and working - with the other girls. Well, Nic has improved a lot - but I don't think - she's quite ready for a competition just yet. Besides, Jess doesn't want her in the team. Jess? What does she have-- -Hey, great moves on the bar. -Thank you. - I'm a little bit - out of practice, though. If that's your out of practice, I'd like to see you in practice. - Come on, man. - Is that your best line? - Luke, you got - that brown paper bag? Might need it. I keep forgetting I need to get new friends. -I like your accent. -It's Canadian, yeah? No, the mighty US of A. -Thank you very much. -Told you, didn't I? Ah, US. I love the US. What part of States you from? - -Georgia. - -Hm. - -Hey, Mom? - -Mm-hmm? Do you remember Megan from the US team? -[Sarah] That girl who laughed that time the uneven bars collapsed. Yup, I remember. She was a tough competitor. Never got the feeling she was much of a friend, though. -Why? -It doesn't matter. What about Sophie and Elorie? - [Sarah] - They were great gymnasts. Really nice girls. I thought they were friends, as well, aren't they? I always liked them. [Kelly] Yeah, me too. Not so sure. Mel just messaged. We are officially entered - into the National Teams comp - in Melbourne! [cheering] You know, I sort of miss the high of competing. Yeah. I'd just like to try it once and find out. - [Kelly] - Yeah. So, um... - how are you gonna - pay for the trip? - Well, that's why - I've been working and missing a few sessions. I was not gonna miss this. [pop music playing] [indistinct chatter] Kelly. Did you hear? - We're going - to the team Nationals. Oh, yeah. Congratulations. You guys must be really excited. Well, you know how these teams events work, right? With only the top three scores counted on each apparatus it would really help to have a fourth team member to help drop our lower scores. I'd really like you on the team, Kelly. Look, I, I really appreciate the offer but I'm just not looking to compete right now. - But if you need - an extra team member I don't see why Nic can't join the team, right? Nic is just not up to it. W-what do you mean? Have you even seen her lately? Uh, she's improved by leaps and bounds like... literal leaps and bounds. No, I've not really seen her lately but Jess says she's not really up to a National Team comp. We need to strengthen the team, not add a weak member. Nic has been working so hard. I think with just a little bit of extra training - she could really get - to that next level-- Listen, if you change your mind, please let me know. You really shouldn't let a talent like yours go to waste. - [Kelly] - I just don't get this control - that Jess has over - the rest of the team and Coach Mel. You literally can't hurt the team's scores - and they're still - not letting you in. - I'm just not good enough - for the team yet. - I mean, I get it - from Mel's side - because it's a really big deal - here to have coached - the girl who gets - the US gymnastics scholarship. So she's not gonna get Jess offside. Don't stress about it so much! - You need to learn - to relax a little. Hm. Hey, remember when I said I'd take you to a netball game? Is that the basketball thing where you can't run with the basketball? The netball. How about coming to the girls versus boys? I don't know. I'm okay. Thanks. I guess Scotty would just have to be disappointed. -Yeah, now you wanna come. -Okay, fine. ♪ One two three four ♪ Here! ♪ Kick it up ♪ ♪ Go go go go ♪ ♪ Kick it up ♪ Ah! I'm over this. Let's go. Come on. ♪ Go go go go ♪ Here, here, here. [groans] - [Sam] - Oh, my knee! [indistinct chatter] - [Ashley] - Oh, Sam! [gasps] You okay? What happened? ACL complete tear. I'll need a recon. I'm out for 12 months! Twelve months? Perfect. That stuffs us up. [Mel] Jess! I mean, it's tragic for you and for us. You'll be back, though. What about Nationals? Um, no offense, but... Well, Nic is ready and keen. - I'll have another look - at how she's going. Nic? Not a chance. - Psycho girl, - she'll only weaken the team. What about Kelly? I mean, she honestly is an awesome gymnast. - -Kelly? - -Yeah. Who says she's any good? - [together] - We do. Kelly? Alright. I guess we need a third member... only if she's better than Nic. Well, I've already tried to get Kelly to join us. - It might be better - if one of you girls ask her. A bit of peer pressure. What? You've already asked her? Jess, she's good. Like really good. She'd be good for the team. Might even give you some competition. I reckon you ask her, Jess - because she'd respect you - the most. So it would just work. - [groans] - Uh! Alright. Fine. Looked really bad to me. ACL, I guess. -That's terrible for Sam. -I know. Those injuries take forever to recover from. You know what this might mean. Um, she'll have to have a reconstruction? No! Well... Yes, but something else. - They're a team member short - for Nationals. -They'll have to ask you! -Oh, yeah! Oh, that would be awesome - but still, like, - terrible for Sam but I'd love to make the team! I think you're about to. -Hey, Sam, how are you? -Hey. Yeah, um, not so good. I've... done my ACL, so I need a reconstruction. - That's awful, Sam. - I'm really sorry. Yeah, me too. You were doing amazing in the game. Yeah, well, looks like that's over. Maybe forever. Hey, you know, I used to compete against a girl who blew her ACL. When she came back, she kicked my butt on beam. - -Really? - -Really. Okay, enough with story time. Obviously, we need another member for Nationals, so... Kelly, you can join us. What? You must be joking. What about Nic? No, I'm offering... We are offering Sam's spot to you. No way! Nic is perfect! She's improved a ton! Ton. What's a ton? We aren't even talking about Nic. - Are you saying - you're not joining? Look, I really appreciate the offer - but like I told - Coach Mel already I'm taking a break. - Nic is perfect. - You need a third team member. -Don't be so stuck up! -Me? No, not having this. - You don't have to - worry about it. It's fine. [cell phone ringing] -Hey! -Are you okay? -I'm fine. -Are you sure? - Because I'm stalking you - online right now and I just read some posts. Who are Sophie and Elorie? I mean... And who is this Megan, and what's her deal? Hm. Megan. Well... nothing really surprises me from her. She's my old gym rival. Kind of like the Jess of the United States but without the warm charm. But Sophie and Elorie, I mean I thought they were my friends. Especially Sophie, I just thought she understood. -Understood what? -Forget it. It doesn't matter. [Kelly] I mean, none of it's true, anyway. But with Megan my dad didn't select her for the State team. She had too much attitude, thought she knew it all. So she moved to another state and... now she hates my dad and me. And then a bunch of stuff happened and then I moved to Australia and apparently, all my friends think I'm terrible. [Nicola] I've seen you in action. You are awesome! Okay? Anyway, it doesn't matter. Sam just told me that Ashley has some friend of hers joining the team. - She trains in some other club - and apparently she's pretty good, too. It's a pity, I... I would've liked to have gone to Nationals. I might quit, I think. There's no point. What? No! Don't do that! We have done so much, and you have come so far! Nic, you're gonna show everyone. -We both are. -Wha-what? - Is this National Team comp - the same one that qualifies teams for the Australian Invitational? Yeah, the top four or five teams - stand to compete - in the Invitational the next day, I think. Okay, don't quit. Meet me at the gym tomorrow. I have a plan. What are you two doing here? The old Saranti's gym's at the back. And yet, here you are. -Why don't you just get-- -Save it, Jess. I've got an offer for the team. We're not interested. - Do you wanna - go to Nationals or not? Oh, haven't you heard? We are going. Well, you wanna catch the judge's attention, right? Impress to get a US scholarship? I'll compete with you. Together, the team will have a better chance of doing well... but the only thing is Nic is in too if I join. -Wait, what? -Still not interested. What makes you think we can do better with you? Jess, Kelly could score really well. It could get us to the top of the club teams. How does that help me? Look, I'm not interested in a scholarship but the team going to top ten or even top five will get attention for you. I've been competing in big comps since I learned how to walk. The girls say you're the best. So we'll have a one-on-one apparatus comp. You and me. Any apparatus you choose. If I win... Nic and I are in. And if we lose... we're out. Go on, Jess. Nothing to lose. You'll smash her. What? No way! Kelly is... in real trouble. - Are you sure - you wanna do this, Kelly? Yes. Alright. You're on! Buzz. But if I win and I decide you're good enough... you join the team... without Nic. Yes, come on, Jess. Let's go! Smash it out, Jess. Kip to the high bar cast a handstand giant, giant dismount. Kelly is doing Jess' routine... except it's perfect. Ooh, my God! Kelly, that was really amazing! What? - [Mel] - Okay, Jess excellent score as per usual 37.5... But, Kelly, 43. - Kelly and Nic, - you're on the team! Oh, my God! Yay! Wow! Hate to admit it, but impressive, Kelly. No way are you doing that to me, girl. Well, what have you been up to? Just working with Mel before and after practice. - Haven't trained - in a while, gotta catch up. Catch up to who? You're the best girl on the team. -Ten more seconds, girls. -Let's go thirty. - -What? - -What? I'm dying here. You wanted to be here. Ah, it burns! - [Mel] - Okay, relax. - Thirty seconds relax - and we go again? What's with the whip, Kelly? No pain, no gain. No, seriously, you're smashing us, mate. It's all I know. Either all in or not at all. [Nicola] Where did that come from? - [Kelly] - My dad, I guess. - It's either - total commitment or nothing. Let's go again? - [Mel] - Okay. Ready... and go. - Nic, what is with the arms? - We talked about this. Yeah, well, I just wanna be free. Show some of my own style. This is not freestyle dance this is a major competition! -Focus! -Girls, you are too serious. - [Nicola] - Relax. Start the music! [pop music playing] Look at her. She's gonna drag us all down. Never been to Melbourne but I think my luggage went there. That's about as close I've got to visiting so far, but... - -What's it like? - -Oh, much bigger than Adelaide. - -Um, there's this-- - -How about we just focus on winning comps, okay? Some of us actually want to do well. - So maybe you could focus - on the competitions and not on everything else. Chill, Jess. We all wanna do well. We're all focused and working hard. I hope so. Because there's no way I'm letting any dead weight anchor us down in competitions. You know what I mean? Um, has she read what I'm thinking she's read? Their pages are public. You read them, remember? - Well, who cares? - She's just being mean. - Look, don't let her - get you down, Kel. - You're the best gymnast - I've ever seen. -You're gonna do great! -We both are. - You know, you might - be disappointed in your new best friend once competition starts. She's not all she's cracked up to be. Kelly? She's not my best friend. Wait, what do you mean? Just remember you heard it here first. We'll see when comps start who has what it takes. - [Nicola] - Hey, Ash, you forgot to mention - it's either raining - or about to rain in Melbourne all the time. - Expecting to see - Bella and Edward. - Do you wanna see how many chips - I can fit in my mouth? No, not really. [Scotty] Good, it's actually not that many. I would've embarrassed myself. Now you should be embarrassed. You made me. - -Well... - -I'll be back. Come back when you learn some manners. Oh, gross... Yeah. Look. You've managed to worm your way on to the team and bring your weirdo little friend along, too. But guess what, I've been doing a bit of reading about you. Yeah, I've noticed. You're a lot of things, Jess, but subtle isn't one of them. It's true, isn't it? You lose it when it comes to competitions? Okay, you don't know anything about what happened. That stuff you saw online was just some jealous girl! Not the first one. And apparently, not the last. I don't care what you do on your own time, Kelly but you had better not tank this competition, not this time. -Jess, it's just a sport! -No, it's not! It might be just a sport to you but I've been working my whole life for an opportunity like this. I haven't had everything handed to me by my daddy. I've earned this. Don't you dare mess it up. I haven't had anything handed to me-- Oh, Kelly, I really don't care. I just don't want my future being dragged down by another dead weight anchor performance by you. You've got it? [sniffles] Hey, Kel... She-she was with Jess. What did you say to her? Just some home truths. What are you thinking? We start our comps tomorrow, Jess. It's a team competition, it's not just all about you. The team does bad, you do bad. Just get over yourself! Hey! What happened back there? Nothing. I just... What if Jess is right? Right about what? This is my first competition on my own without my dad. - This is my chance - to show everyone - that I'm good enough - to make it on my own - without any sort - of special treatment but what if I'm not? What if I just drag the team down? What are you talking about? - You're the best gymnast - on the team. - You're just - saying that because-- Because it's true! But it doesn't matter how much I believe in you you gotta believe in yourself. I'm sorry, I, I have to go. - Hello and welcome - to day three of the competition to beautiful Melbourne where it's really starting to hot up. - -Kelly, can I talk to you-- - -Not now. - -I just don't want you to-- - -Jess. - I'm trying to focus - on the competition. - I don't need you - in my head right now. -Yeah, but that's what I'm-- -Don't worry. I'll be doing my very best... regardless of what you think. [Dave] So over the next few days, we'll see who qualifies for the annual Australian International Invitational. The Invitational which always follows the club competition where only the best and in-form Australian competitors qualify. - [Michelle] - That's right, Dave, the first international competition of the year which always attracts the up-and-coming gymnasts from Australia and overseas. There are strong club teams again this year but we haven't had a club team qualify in the top five for years! [crowd cheering] [gym vault clunks] [soft thud] What were you saying about the dead weight? [applause] [applause] - [Michelle] - Beautiful routine from Kelly. Will she try and pull out a big move in this last part? - [Michelle] - No, it's just a front layout - and she struggled - on the landing, Dave. - [Dave] - Still having a hard time with that final pass, Michelle. - But we've seen - some great gymnastics from Kelly today and it's great to see her back in competition. [Michelle] Will you look at that? That is amazing. The Aerial Club Team... Wait, we might qualify for the Invitationals. - [Michelle] - A real nail-biter. And all the more tense because of that last-minute mistake from Kelly Johnson that might be... - Aren't you gonna say, - "I told you so"? - I didn't come here to be right, - I came here to win. [Dave] The scores will now be totaled and we'll see... Good work, though. [Michelle] The scores are coming through now. [Dave] First to qualify, as expected, the young Aussie Starlets. - Next is - the New South Wales team. Victoria are third. Queensland team are in, too. Aerial have been brave in their performance. That's amazing, the Aerial Club Team have qualified for the Invitationals. - [Michelle] - That's the first time in years, Dave a club team has qualified. Congratulations to Aerial and all the qualifying teams. Oh, my God! - [Dave] - That sets up some fantastic competition for the Invitational. - We'll see Kelly Johnson - back competing in a big competition again. Look forward to that. [applause] -Um, congratulations. -Oh, thank you. - -It was nice. - -Thanks. Good work. - Oh, awesome result, - each of you-- Oh, uh, Mom's here. Sorry, g-gotta go. Uh, talk later? Yeah? Weird. -Oh, you stink. -Seriously? No, man. You're alright. - Hey, what was - with the handshake? Did she say something? -I said, "Awesome result." -Oh, mate, that would do it. Maybe you should play hard to get. Okay, so I just got a list of the teams we will be competing against. Uh, the Aussie teams which qualified, of course. Plus... France, UK Germany, New Zealand and the United States. Well... we've done, like, huge just to get here. - -Yeah. - -So... - It doesn't really matter - what happens. -Yeah. -What? Why do you sound like you're giving up? Just because they're international gymnasts? They're just like us. Ashley, I have never seen you - look that amazing - on the beam before. And, Nic, this is your first competition and you advanced. I mean, we're only point two behind the best Australian team. We're gonna do even better tomorrow. [sighs] [chuckles] Is it just me, or did it suddenly get all inspirational in here? [chuckles] Wow, you're really determined. It's more bravado than confidence, trust me. I think it worked. Well, I mean, I guess I'm still a little nervous about competing against Megan, and my old team but this is my chance to show them that they're wrong about me. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. This is a different story from last night. What changed? Well, a little pep talk with a friend. He told me to believe in myself so... I'm trying it out. Well, this friend of yours... he sounds really... awesome and, uh, handsome. -Hm, no, he's not. -Hey. Which one is Megan? You can tell by the dagger shooting out of her eyes into the back of my head. [chuckles] You taught her well, Kelly. Megan, you've been warned. Now cut it out. -What? -Hey. Wait, what? I guess she really appreciates him telling her to cut it out. W-w-what are you doing here? I didn't know you were coming. - Well, I could say the same - for you. Yeah, last minute replacement for Tara. - She couldn't be here - till Saturday night so they asked me to step in. - Sorry, I didn't get - a chance to tell you. I, I thought I'd call and surprise you while I was Down Under. Uh, guys, this is my dad, Pete. This is Coach Mel, Nic, Jess and Ashley. My Aerial gym team. Delighted to meet you all. I didn't know you were competing. "Aerial." You guys qualified for International. Hey, congrats. That's my girl. Well, we're about done. So the floor and the equipments' all yours. Uh, but you must wanna catch up with Kel. - Uh, you know, actually, - I'll just, uh... I think I'll go back... with you guys. Are you sure? I can drop you off at the hotel, Kels. - Why don't you stay? - We can catch up. I-I don't wanna distract you guys from practice. Team comes first, yeah. We can catch up later after training then. Okay. You guys ready? Alright, bye. Good luck tomorrow, anchor. Oh, sorry, did I say "anchor"? I meant dead weight, daddy's girl. See you on the floor. It's alright. What is she going on about? That's Megan. We used to compete together back home. - My last two comps - weren't that good so she always liked to blame me for the team's poor results. Even though she always seems to forget - that if she hadn't - stepped out of bounds so much we still would've placed. Sorry to mention it, but... it looked weird with your dad back there. Yeah, I actually didn't tell him I was doing gymnastics again. Why? Um, he always used to push me - to try new things - in competitions that I wasn't really ready for. It was a really big issue between him and my mom. - She thought that he was putting - too much pressure on me. He thought she wasn't pushing me to my full potential. And they fought about it all the time. And then, eventually, when I blew a really big tumbling pass in my last competition, they had a huge fight. And... the next week - they told me they were - separating. - [Ashley] - Oh, God. So... I don't know I just didn't really wanna open it back up again. - And besides, - I wanna prove that I can do this without him. And show Megan and everyone - that I deserve - that spot on the team and that it wasn't just favoritism. But I guess, it's just sort of awkward now. Well, the good thing is, you did it. You showed them. We wouldn't have even qualified for the Invitational without your performance. Um, and your awesome vaults, Jess. I mean, you've got so much air - I thought you were - gonna fly in the stands. You know what, guys? - I don't even care - what this Megan thinks. Alright? We're all going to smash it out tomorrow. We'll make her regret ever taking a trip Down Under. [chuckles] I thought she did really well. -Kelly. -Yeah, I guess she looked okay. I mean, she did alright in that stupid club comp but she'll freak out like before and tank it in the big comp tomorrow. Trust me, I mean, she just doesn't have what it takes and it'll be like last year, all over again. Well, she was going through a lot back then. She's just not tough enough. - I mean, daddy can't - save her this time and she'll crash and burn. I'm calling it. Kelly did confide in me how hard it was for her in those final comps before she quit. Her parents were fighting all the time. She couldn't focus. With her dad as coach, the pressure on her must've been huge. I mean, I feel really sorry for her now. She did awesome yesterday. - Just our luck to get caught - in a cross fight between Kelly and Megan. If we lose to a club team, even if Kelly is in it we'll be a complete laughing stock. [sniffles] [sobs] - [Sarah] - Kel? Kelly, honey, what's wrong? I don't think this was a good idea. What, the competition? The competition, competing without Dad. Megan, all of it. Isn't this what you wanted? To win without your dad? Mom, Dad's here. Your father's here? He said he was a last-minute replacement for Tara. - I saw him today. - I had no idea what to say. It was so weird. - I just wanted to help Nic - get on the team before she quit and then, with Megan pushing my buttons I just thought I could prove something to myself and... to Dad, too. Isn't that what you're doing? Mom, I just, I just feel the pressure of it all now. Especially with Dad here, it just... feels so wrong. Honey, I-I know you're upset. But what feels so wrong? I know it was my fault you and Dad separated. What? What? Is that what you think? Dad was mad because I was messing up. And then you were mad because he was mad. All because... I couldn't do the moves - that I should've been - able to do. So I thought if I quit, you and Dad would stop fighting and now I'm back to competing. Kelly, Kelly, honey, listen to me. What happened between your father and me is not your fault. We were fighting about everything. Not just you and the competitions. Look at me. With the pressure at my job and the pressure on your dad to win the competitions we just lost sight of each other. It was not because of you. What you've just achieved here is amazing. To come back, to compete after all that time away and with barely any time to prepare. And you did it on your own. On your own terms. I'm so proud of you, honey. And I know your dad will be, too. You need to make decisions that are right for you, not for me and not for your dad. What's right for you. Honey. [sniffles] [upbeat music] This is Jordyn Wieber, reporting live from the Australian Invitational. The Australian Invitational is always scheduled outside of the main competition season - to let the young, - up-and-coming gymnasts have their first taste of international competition. [cheering] - I'm here with Lauren Bell, - whose sister Sophie is competing with the US team here. - Are you excited to be here - with your sister? I'm so excited. I can't wait to compete here one day, too. He's cute. Did your daddy help you get him, too? You know what, Megan? I used to think if I was good enough if I won enough comps, you would like me and we could be friends. - But you know - what I realized? That you're not good enough? No. That I just don't care. You might be a good gymnast, but you are not a good person. At least I'm a good gymnast. You can't even say that. - We'll see what the scores are - at the end of the day. Yeah, you can check out my site. I'll post some photos of me and my gold medal. You can touch the screen. - That's the closest - you're gonna get to one. [crowd cheering] [together] Three, two, one, Aerial! - [male announcer] - Welcome the team from the United States of America. [crowd cheering] Put your hands together, our team all the way from France. [cheering] Please welcome our team from Germany! [cheering] Gymnasts, please march to your first apparatus and present yourselves to the judges. [Dave] That's the presentation out of the way. Now the competition. And this will be a fascinating competition to watch. The small time Aerial team with ex-American junior champion Kelly Johnson on the same rotation as the American team - with some of her - former teammates. [Michelle] As this is a teams' event, they'll have to put up three outstanding gymnastic routines on each apparatus. We saw Jess Watkins score very well yesterday. - There are college scouts - out here and they'll be watching her today. We also saw good performances from both Nicola Mathews and Ashley Bryant. [Dave] Of course, Kelly had that final floor-routine disaster with her father coaching her in the US Junior Nationals last season. And with that big stumble yesterday... [Michelle] The stakes are high. All these girls are looking to impress, to be included to make the final training team for the Olympics. [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] Beautiful, alright. [Michelle] An elegant vault from Megan McCormack. That's enough to put her in the lead with Kelly Johnson up next. These girls are on fire today. Just a few moments ago, we saw Megan edge out Kelly's score on the beam. Let's see if Kelly can get that lead back. [Michelle] Wow, that was beautiful. Fantastic vault. - [Dave] - Yeah, that'll do it, Michelle. Definitely good enough to outscore Megan in the vault. [Michelle] The competition here today is intense. This battle between Kelly and Megan is setting the standard for every gymnast who follows. They're laying down a benchmark and everyone is trying to keep up with them. It's exhilarating. No one wants to lose to the small time club Aerial but these girls are so focused on making every step a winner. [Dave] The teams are just making their last rotational change now which brings Team USA and Aerial on to the floor to finish the competition. - -Whoo! - -Come on. Ashley Bryant from Aerial - put in a great routine - yesterday. Her teammates will be hoping she nails it again today. [Michelle] Oh, no! Ashley's had a big fall. She'll struggle to recover from that. Some nice moves from Ashley but another stumble on the landing. [sobbing] I'm so sorry. It's not so bad, girls. Jess' routine and score was awesome. That keeps us in touch with the podium finish and the Americans. [Dave] Michelle, we've seen the floor is not Nicola's best event. She's gonna have to be at the top of her game if she wants to keep Aerial in contention here. [sighs] So no pressure. [exhales sharply] Run up and fly away. [Michelle] But remember, only the top three scores count. Okay, you know what your problem is? No, what? Tell me. Remember everything I told you about taking it seriously? Yeah. - -Forget it. - -What? - You've already done the part, - you've taken it seriously. You've put in the work. It's time to relax and have a little fun. - This is your first - real competition, Nic. Enjoy it. -You'll do great. -Okay. [Michelle] Aerial can still medal if Nicola and Kelly do well here.

That's just what Aerial needed. A great score from her. Nic, Nic, Nic, Nic. That was amazing. I-I-I've never ever ever seen you do something like that. Did you have fun or what? Oh, it was, it was awesome. I-I can't... -Good routine, Nic. -What was that? I'm... glad you're here. Ah! [Michelle] Just looking over and... All the red flags are up apart from the floor. So these two routines will be the last for the competition. - [Dave] - The scores are close here. The Americans are comfortably in front with just Megan McCormack to perform. One mistake, though, could change everything. [Michelle] Dave, I feel certain Megan will put in a very conservative routine here to play it safe and protect her and the team's lead. [upbeat music] [applause] [Dave] Megan would recall Kelly's fall on the floor at their last competition costing her team gold or any chance of the medal. [Michelle] Even her final pass is just a very clean front sault. The American's definitely taking no risks here. [applause] [Dave] Megan and her team will feel certain - Kelly won't be - able to come up with anything to threaten their lead. [exhales sharply] [Michelle] Huge pressure on Kelly now to try and get Aerial back into medal contention. Whoo! Come on, Kelly! [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] [Michelle] A beautiful start with the compulsories, Dave. She knows what she has to do here and she's... Oh, no. - [Dave] - Oh, that's a heart-breaker, Michelle. To lose points on a simple move like that. [Michelle] I think she just cost her team any chance of a medal, Dave. She just has a final tumbling pass left. I don't think that will earn her enough points to make up for that error. Come on. [applause] [crowd cheering] [Dave] Wow, oh, wow! That was beautiful. Amazing. [Michelle] A double Arabian! That skill is worth an extra half a point on her score. This wasn't a planned part of the routine. A double Arabian, that's a half twist with a double front somersault. [Dave] She must have added it to make up for that error, Michelle. This was the move that cost - Kelly's team the gold - last year. And this year, it may be just what wins it for her and the team. Michelle, just waiting on the final places. Aerial has won silver! The small Aerial club have taken the silver. -Silver? We took silver? -But it's not gold. - We weren't even supposed - to be good enough - to get into the Invitationals. - We just medaled! [yelling] [Michelle] Aerial with Kelly's stunning performance have taken the silver by the smallest of margins. Incredible! Hey, what's with that look? She just took gold. Look at the individual leaderboard. [crowd cheering] [yelling] Good work, Kel. Glad we had that pep talk about being an anchor. Oh, you call that a pep talk? It worked, didn't it? [crowd applauding] Hey, what's going on? Uh, somebody might have mentioned to the US coaches that their star gymnast was a cyber-bully. I hear there's a pretty strict policy on that sort of thing. [chuckling] [Dave] That concludes the medal presentation. Congratulations to all the girls. [yelling] ♪ No one can stop us ♪ ♪ No one can stop us ♪ ♪ We're in a league of our own ♪ Yeah. ♪ No one can stop us ♪ ♪ We're coming back ♪ ♪ No no ♪ ♪ We're coming back ♪ ♪ No one can stop us ♪ Finishing with a double Arabian. Wow! - I know, I convinced - Coach Mel to help me with it - before and after practice, - but I can't believe I did it. It felt so cool. Oh, I'm super proud of you, honey. I think somebody else wants to talk to you. Okay, hold this. Stop. Girl so can work him out. It's fine. You don't have to say it. Say what? You were right, Scotty. I just had to believe in myself, Scotty. Go on a date with me, Scotty. [chuckles] Okay. - -He's asking her out. - -Wait. -Okay, what? -Okay. I'll go on a date with you. Saturday night, dinner and a movie. -Wear something nice. -Oh, so cute. Well, that went well. [chuckles] - -He's really nice. - -Thank you. [knock at door] Kelly. Dad, Tara, hey. Tara wanted to speak to you and Jess actually before she flies out. Jess... nice to meet you. I was very impressed with your performance today. -You're a senior, right? -Yeah, yep. - Now, I don't know if Kelly - told you or not but I am the head coach at California State College. And I would like to offer you... a full scholarship for next year. [screams] Are you interested? [yells] Oh... Okay. [laughs] - I think you can - take that as a yes. Hmm. Now, Kelly... Look, I want you to come back to the States. - And-and join our team training - for the Olympics. You have a real shot at it. What do you say? Hm? [Kelly] Dad. Kels, what's up? Did you get Tara to ask me? Oh, well, Tara asked me if I thought - you were up to coming back, - and I said yes. But it's Tara who wants you on the team. With you as assistant coach? Well, that's the plan. This has been what you've been working towards all your life. This is your dream. No... it's not. Dad, I love gymnastics, and I love you but... not together. What do you mean? I don't want a dad who is a tutor or a coach. I just want a dad who's a dad. But this is the Olympics. It's your dream. No, Dad, it's not, it's your dream. But... this is what you've said you've always wanted. Yeah, and it was, but it's not... now. And it hasn't been for a while. And if you would've have been my dad and not my coach you would've noticed that. [exhales sharply] Kelly, now, I only want what's best for you. So if this isn't what you want, then that's okay. I've been concentrating on being a coach. You know, chasing the dream. I think I've forgotten how to be a dad and a husband. I don't wanna be without you or your mom. So are we okay? We're better than okay. What about your mom? You think she might be up to talking to me again? That might take a little more work. But if I've learned anything from my gymnastics coach it's that if you love something, it's worth the work. You know, now with Jess gone, that'd make you head girl. -It could be alright. -Yeah. So what happened? Um, well, she sort of offered me a shot at the Olympics - to go back - and train with the team. That's awesome. Kel, you're not gonna go, are you? Are you mad that I'm not going? Of course not. But are you sure this is what you want? - This is a huge opportunity, - Kelly. You worked so hard for it. I just feel like I found myself. I have nothing to prove. I just want some time for me. And I wanna have a mom and dad again. Oh, Kelly. -I love you. -I love you, too. -Hi, I'm Scotty. -Okay. - [Kelly] - Good day! You've missed me. Havin' a ball Down Under.
