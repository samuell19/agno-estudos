13th June 1963 The Vatican says it is too dangerous to keep the stone in its catacombs. It will be my task to hide the stone and study it. Remote from civilization. Lonely, but in the service of the Lord. According to the records, with the black stone, it is possible to open a transition to the spheres of Hell. Your own blood must be fed to the stone and the stone will then open a portal. The blood behaves like sand in an hourglass. If the force of the blood supplied is exhausted, one is automatically catapulted back into reality again. This underworld is very similar to our own, just cold and dead. Something is lurking in the darkness, lusting for life. Even before there was light, everything was one. The darkness ruled over the whole of existence. When the Lord sent the light, the spheres were separated. Heaven, Earth and Hell. But evil opposed the separation and so it came to war between the angels of Heaven and the demons of the underworld. In an unimaginable cruel battle, the dark was defeated, Lucifer overthrown, and the dungeons and fortresses of Hell exiled to their own sphere. But parts of these walls, parts of what is called Hell, floated undiscovered and untouched by the light in our universe. A rock, blasted out the walls of Hell, struck the Earth and was hidden for millions of years below the surface. Through erosion and natural catastrophes, the dark stone was eventually uncovered, and with it the darkness came over the world It was that stone, with which Cain slew Abel. But this was only the beginning of the disaster, which brought this relic from another dimension to mankind. Soon dark forces were aware of the capabilities of the stone. If you knew how you had to use it, you could transfer between the spheres and summon evil. The sacred Roman Catholic Church eventually took possession of the stone in a bloody battle and hid it centuries ago it its catacombs. In the summer of 1939, however, the stone was stolen by a satanic covenant. After millions of deaths and the destruction of half of the world, the stone fell back to the hands of Rome. But the dark covenant has never ceased to look for the stone. To this day, it was safely hidden. Until today. Let me out! Lord, forgive me! I have been waiting for ever. One second of your time lasts a thousand years in hell. As I see, you found the stone. Sacrifice the monk! Soak the stone with his blood and with his last breath I will take possession of his lifeless body. Do not disappoint me! And now, get the monk back and seal his fate! What was that now? Shit! No! Hey... hey! Hey, what have you got there? That's not mine. Some crazy satanists are after me you have to help me, like, how do I get out of here? What satanists? No idea! They killed someone. And what is that? I took it from one of them. Well, then put it away, or give it to me. Hey, listen, we have to get out of here quickly Ok, I'm coming with you, but only if you do away with this dagger. Just tell me where I have to go, okay? I'll go on further alone. If we follow the path in this direction then we come out from the forest fairly quickly. Ok Ok, let's go then. How far in about? Not far, a few hundred meters. What are you actually doing here all alone? I come here to walk, and you? Stop! Wait! Ok. You didn't answer my question yet. What are you doing here all alone? Because when I was a kid and my mother was still alive, I was always here with her. And now I come here every year and think of the past. How did she die? Stabbed in a raid. I'm sorry. And your father? The old man burned. Then you are really alone Well Stop! How did it feel like killing someone with an axe? What was I supposed to do, he attacked me! Wait a moment, how do you know? You will die! Just like the bitch you call your mother! Hey, I'll get you out of here. Come on! Come on. Wait, we can soon get away. Where? Where were you for so long? Take the stone from him! Nooo! What's happening? Do you think you're safe now? Do you think you can escape me? Me? In my own realm? Come here! Father. Where are you? Where are you hiding? Get your punishment, you waster! Stop crying! Stop it! Now your hell begins! Leave me alone! Get him, my little one! Get him! What the... Find him. Come on. Come on, please start you piece of shit! please start! Please! Yes! He has the stone. Kill him! He will not get far. What? Shit! Damn it! Hello? October 13, 1971. The 8th year of the translation of The Book of Darkness. The book warned of a crossing. Each crossing is highly risky as living beings shine in hell for demons and evil spirits as a night lantern does for insects. The demons are lured by life and can harm the living. If a man dies in the dimension of Hell, his soul is trapped there. There is no turning back for them. Embedded in the text are drawings of demons. The first one could be of sumerian origin. On the following pages... I have done it. I was over there! I used the stone and entered Hell. May God and the holy Church forgive me. I hid myself but I think that something noticed my track. When I came back, I had the feeling of constant observation. The stone can not only be used to allow a living person wander through Hell, but it can also bring the damned to Earth. In the book it is stated that a person must be killed at a specific geographical nodal point, and in the moment of his death, the stone has to be soaked with the blood of the victim. No longer does the soul of the deceased reach the spheres of Hell, however, the body is accessible to demons and evil spirits. The evil being can take control of the body in the moment of death. The soul of the dying person is shattered completely upon the entrance of a demon. The black covenant has set itself the goal of uniting the sphere of Hell with reality again. They want to create a transition. According to the book, after a human is sacrificed, there will be a radius of about 5 kilometers, in which the forces of Hell can act, and the spheres blur slowly but surely. If the stone is not taken away within a few hours from this vicinity, along with the body which is possessed by the evil spirit, the influence of Hell grows exponentially. I have created a simulation, just in case. If anyone is listening, I think I'm being followed. I'm not sure but in the event I am right, the black stone should never fall into the hands of the dark covenant. Never! It is not safe with the Church. The dark covenant has infiltrated too many of us. I... I will try to escape. With God's grace I will... Drop it! Where is the monk? They killed him. They? You mean you killed him! For the last time, where is he? Listen, I have nothing to do with it! I saw some crazy satanists kill him and then he got up again and has changed. Therefore I have nothing to do with it! Go over there. Now! Go over there! Turn around! Please, I have nothing to do with it. Everything is just a coincidence, or what? My car broke down. I wanted to hide here. How do I even know that you're not one of them? I don't give a shit about what you think! Every week I come over here to help the old man, to see how he is doing. Where is your car? A couple of meters that way up there. Then go! Come on! But it does not work anymore, it is stopped. Yeah you expect me to believe you, go now! Listen, they are here somewhere and extremely dangerous! Yeah, tell that to the polic... Really? One shot? Give me the stone. Give me the stone, and I spare you. Come and get it! Amen! Dammit! Come out! Come to me, come to this world! The lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Got you! You are to blame for the death of your mother! Sleep kid, sleep! I loved her. Was that all? No it was not! If anyone is listening, I think I'm being followed. I'm not sure but in the event I am right, the black stone should never fall into the hands of the dark covenant. Never! Never! Give up! Do you think you killed this wonderful creature? I can summon him again. Over and over again! Then just do it! As you wish. If the stone is not taken away within a few hours from this vicinity, along with the body which is possessed by the evil spirit, the influence of Hell grows exponentially. You will suffer for it! I will tear you to pieces! My son! You did it! You have banished the evil spirit and I have taken his place to be with you again. Trust me, my son. The evil is gone. Let us go home. How do I know that you are you? How do I know that I've already crossed the threshold? The nightmare is over. Now nothing can break us apart. Do you remember how we played together in the forest? What are you waiting for my darling? I missed you so much! Please let me loose, the chains cut into my flesh. Please release me. Feed on him! Feed on this bastard! Come on, you weakling! You can't kill me! What are you doing there? What now? What do you want to do? Amen! Welcome to my hell!
