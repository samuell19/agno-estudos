TODAY The cast of the series... ... will relive moments of the past... ... childhood memories... I started at the theater very young. Some gaffes. Is it good? Some surprises. It is with joy that we share a world premiere. And a lot of music. Welcome to "High School Musical." - "The Musical." - "Happy Holidays Special!" THE MUSICAL: HAPPY HOLIDAYS Special We're in Arizona. I know it's not the North Pole, but this is where I grew up and where I spent almost every Christmas in my life. When I think of Christmas, I think of my family. Waking up on Christmas morning, seeing the presents on the tree, see that the cookies and the milk that we’ll leave at night are not there. And, of course, there is no Christmas without an elf and fortunately, I have my dog, Violet. She is so cute! Always open presents on Christmas Day and it’s so funny, it’s all excited. Over the years, I have been fortunate to meet and connect with a lot of people, therefore, I wanted to dedicate this music to all the fans who grew up with me and, of course, to my "High School Musical" family. I miss you so much. We may not be together on this court, but the music always makes us return. THIS CHRISTMAS WITH SOFIA WYLIE Saguaro National Park NORTH POLE Heavens! I grew up outside San Diego with five sisters, two wonderful parents and all the music you can imagine. My father was a professional pianist and drummer. We all have some of that in our blood. Music is an important part of my life and I compose almost every day. In the first season, I was lucky to compose a song with the charming Olivia Rodrigo. When we're under the lights FIRST SEASON My heart no longer gives For a moment S َ for a moment With the second season, I had the surreal opportunity to write my own Christmas music for Ricky, that he sings to Nini, because he has no money for gifts and do what you know best, which is to compose a song. It was a dream to compose it. And I don't think I'll say it, but I will interpret it for you today, for the first time. I hope you like our song, "The Perfect Gift". THE PERFECT GIFT WITH JOSHUA BASSETT I still remember our first kiss It didn't take holly to know what it is to love Despite all the ups and downs One thing remains the same The best Christmas is with you by my side I don't have much to give So I hope you will consider it The most perfect gift I could give you To the most perfect gift that ever existed Yes, this song is the second best thing I could give you When the perfect gift is you When the perfect gift is you As the seasons go by And some disorientation I'll be fine if you're by my side And dear, that's why That this song is the second best thing I could give you When the perfect gift is you When the perfect gift is you When the perfect gift is you When the perfect gift is you I was born and raised in Selma, California. We are the raisin capital of the world, if it tells you anything about the type of city. I grew up outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I come from a very musical family. Every Christmas we loved my grandparents ’house, We stand on chairs and sing for the whole family. And they also sang or watched us in rapture while making pictures as a child, because we were not afraid at all. 22:55 DECEMBER 24, 2002 I saw Joe Serafini's video singing "Feliz Navidad". Joe was so tiny. And he says, "From the bottom of my heart." So cute. What I love most about being part of the cast of the series is to have a second family. And it's great, because we have a group of people caring and supportive and encouraging. I grew up singing with my family and when we grow up, each goes their own way and now I have a new duet partner. WITH FRANKIE RODRIGUEZ AND JOE SERAFINI And now... DO YOU KNOW THE CAST WELL? WHO WOULD GIVE THE BEST HOMEMADE GIFT? The person who would give the best homemade gift it would be Julia Lester. It can only be Julia. She really likes to dye clothes. Maybe Olivia. She is the most attentive when it comes to gifts. I would tell Olivia. She strives. I'd say it's Dara. Dara or Frankie, because they really think of us. Frankie gave me a gift and he spent a lot of money on it. I choose Frankie because I know he's not stingy... WHO MAKES THE FATHER LIST OF FATHER NATAL? I don't want to be reporting anyone. I think Joshua Bassett. Maybe Josh. - Joshua Bassett. - Joshua Bassett. It can only be Joshie. They said it was me, right? Sometimes it feels like he's up to something. - It's a terror. - No! Of course they said that. Yes. WHO INTERPRETED TINY TIM IN CRIAN? Joe Serafini played Tiny Tim four years in a row. I played Tiny Tim as a child. Joe Serafini played Tiny Tim as a child. Larry, for sure. Did Kate Reinders play Tiny Tim? What is Tiny Tim? What is it? I grew up in Woodland Hills, California, in a very theatrical family. My parents, Loren and Kelly, met to do theater, and my sisters and I grew up doing theater. We will win the bug very early. There's a lot of musical theater energy in our house. The family is all Jewish and we grew up celebrating Hanukkah. DECEMBER 8, 2001 - Happy Hanukkah. - It's tomorrow. Shall we open the gifts? Sure. Will you light the candles? Open the gifts? Exact. I remember making gingerbread houses with my sisters. But with crackers and sugar coating, because we are Jews. I present Julia's tower to you. I thought about what I could interpret and I could sing to you 100 different Christmas songs like that in color, but what about Mariah Carey's version of a Hanukkah song? So it occurred to me who could give Hanukkah a music video touch and, as I am a big theater fan and it’s literally in my blood, I'll do it in the form of raps a day. L'chaim. RAPS HANUKKAH DAY WITH JULIA LESTER Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel Hanukkah, Hanukkah Come light the smallest Let's party Let's all dance at time Everyone join the table. A surprise will be Dreidels to play and latkes to eat And while we play The candles burn slowly One for each night Your welcoming light - Reminds us of old times - Reminds us of old times Gone times Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel Made of clay When it's dry With dreidel I will play Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel Made of clay When it's dry With dreidel I will play Hands in the air!

See the faces shine Hanukkah, yes, Hanukkah Sing and dance like this Exact! Round and round Happy Holidays Happy parties! Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel I grew up in a city in Arkansas called Rogers. Is one of those places where everyone knows each other, because it is small. I am very given to the family. I grew up in a house that was not properly wealthy. But let's spend time together, that was the most important, and when I said I wanted to come to Los Angeles try to be an actor, my brother decided to raise all savings of a lifetime of work and give me the opportunity. He gave the money to my parents, I came to Los Angeles with my mother and started my career as an actor. There is a picture of me on the morning of Christmas Day with exactly the same striped blue t-shirt that EJ. uses in the first season of the series. Is a curiosity that I didn't know, the fact that the clothes never cease to suit me. It's funny. There is a lot that I love about life. My family, my faith and, at the top of the list, is my Camaro, my baby, my car, my red beauty, which I call Arrow. Today I'm going to sing my song in Hollywood, with my car debuting on TV, with a song from the 80s. It will be a lot of fun. It is a true Christmas dream and miracle. LAST CHRISTMAS WITH MATT CORNETT SLIDE WITH ME I was born in New York and was a real theater kid. I have a picture of me with five years old dressed as a minor. I love doing shows for people. Sometimes I felt ashamed for celebrating Hanukkah and not Christmas. I remember being a kid and asking Santa for a Christmas present because I was always afraid of not receiving anything, although I behaved well. Now, as an adult, I assumed that I am Jewish and that I celebrate a date that may be different from the others. And I am immensely proud of it. I'll sing about dreaming about something that is not there. It is like being an actor. Being able to create something out of nothing. And, now, it was composed by Irving Berlin, a Jewish boy like me. I hope to do it justice. WHITE CHRISTMAS WITH LARRY SAPERSTEIN THE CRAZIEST THING I EVER ASKED FOR CHRISTMAS WAS... I always wanted a baby elephant, I thought it would be really cool. I ordered a black Power Ranger suit and I got the blue one. A school wallet. Exact. For what? To be able to play at schools? Every year, I asked for a new American Girl, although they were all the same. The important thing was to have many. I could play in schools when I wasn't at school. Like a cool kid. - A little brother. - Maybe be a mermaid. Barbie's dream home. I would like a Barbie laptop. I just wanted a wedding dress. My parents gave me everything and I just wanted the dress. Therefore, a wedding dress. LITTLE ST. NICK WITH MATT CORNETT AND JOSHUA BASSETT REFRESHING GRANIZES All right? Merry Christmas. I was born in LA, but I grew up in Baltimore, where my mother opened a theater school for children. One of the reasons she did it was because I was too shy. And that school got me out of my shell. I'm glad my mom did, she has been my inspiration. This song is about Christmas, seeing through the eyes of a child and the charm of waking up on Christmas morning, to be able to be with the family and to know that one day, when we are older, we can be someone completely different, but unique and special to it, with the knowledge acquired over the years. If I said something to my younger self it would be that there are those who doubt us, but always believe in you, have faith in yourself and live each day, every day of the year, as if it were Christmas morning. Do not lose that enthusiasm, joy and desire to continue. End. BELIEVE WITH DARA RENE ة I'm from a small town in Michigan. I got involved in the theater early. I always liked to sing, dance and talk a lot and I was lucky to play many of the roles that any girl dreams of, like Annie and Dorothy, in "The Wizard of Oz", but I also made others which is not really any girl's dream, like Sebastian, the crab, Wilbur, the pig, and Tiny Tim, three years in a row. Exact. Hello. Many people are unaware that I am from Louisiana. I'm from the happy land of Louisiana. I started at the theater very young. I debuted on stage as an angel of God. I took him so seriously that, the designer of the wardrobe gave me a lip gloss to give it an artistic touch, and I thought it was what made me an angel. Today is the best day ever, because I’m going to sing a duet with Mr. Mark St. Cyr. In the series, they know him as Professor Mazzara and he is not very friendly with Prof. Jenn. But the truth is, Mark St. Cyr is a darling. I am honored to accompany you on your first duet, in his first performance in front of the camera, and I only say to you, "Prepare yourself, world." I was told it was a solo. I'm kidding. WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE? WITH KATE REINDERS AND MARK ST. CYR WHAT IS YOUR NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION THIS YEAR? One of the good things this year was that I was able to spend a lot more time with the family and I realized that it was very important and I want to do it again in 2021. Make the most of the time we have, especially with whom we share it. Absorb every moment I have. I feel that sometimes we miss time. Focus more on friends and family and enjoy every second more. Trying to live more in the present, appreciate what we have, be it experiences or memories, and cherish those moments, because they are over. I think my resolutions are always the same. Become the best person I can. That's all I can ask for. My resolution is funny, I don't even know why I do it. It never happens. My resolution is to meet Beyoncé. I know it’s difficult, but Mrs. B, even if it’s Zoom, I don't care. I have so many home videos singing ridiculous songs I made up. Friendship Day, Friendship Day Friendship, friendship Everywhere I'm an only daughter and my parents loved it and they loved to film me. MOTHER, it's not Hannah Montana... I got you, darling. I have so many videos singing this nonsense. The singer-songwriters inspire me a lot, I get really inspired by them, like Taylor Swift, Fiona Apple and Lorde and so on. The best artists are good listeners and I try to learn a lot from them. Today, I'm going to sing "River" by Joni Mitchell. She is one of the most iconic songwriters ever. And she did a good job of writing a sad Christmas song, that I think is special. This court is very nostalgic for many people and that nostalgia doesn't always have to be cheerful and serene, and she does a great job of capturing that. I'm looking forward to singing it. RIVER WITH OLIVIA RODRIGO And now, we will share with you... ... a world premiere... ... from the second season of... ... "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series." Imagine. The kids from the East High School... ... decided to launch their own Instagram page dedicated to me. Well, to the theater club. As only theater kids know how to do. Singing and dancing around the school. Stay for one more song that will make you return. And thanks for having celebrated with us this special time of the year. Go ahead, Frankie and Dara! Ladies and gentlemen and everyone, PEEK 2ھ SEASON here's the new theater club Instagram page. It is with great enthusiasm that we announce that we are returning to the theater all its resplendent glory of the 60s during the holidays. WHAT DOES CHRISTMAS MEAN FOR YOU NOW? For me, Christmas is synonymous WHAT DOES CHRISTMAS MEAN FOR YOU NOW? to take a break from work and travel and remember what it's like to be a normal 16 year old girl. For me, now, Christmas is a good time to be with the family that we don’t see much of the year. I think of the family, the immense fun in the snow and the food. A lot of food. Spend quality time with the family, bring us closer. And they may not know, but it’s my favorite way of showing love. Christmas always made me think of the house where I grew up. But now, with Luke, it’s creating his memories with him. But I also want him to know that Christmas is about being loved, and it's not just about the gifts I give you, and that he is the greatest gift I have ever received. I had the opportunity to give back to my parents. It was difficult for them to offer the whole family a fantastic gift. They did the best they could, and what excites me the most is to be able to repay them and the rest of the family. And you know what? That's Christmas.
