(♪♪♪) (booming) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (helicopter soaring overhead) (♪♪♪) Well, it all started with the great Professor Östergaard and his discovery of the paraverse as we now know it. The exploration into the capability of the human mind is not a new one. (dog barking, shouting) (helicopter blades whirring) We discovered that the paraverse was much like our own world, except that it had been at war for many years. This gave us the perfect environment in which to carry out what had previously only been hypothetical theory. CIA were working on MK-Ultra from the 1950s, and the Russians had their studies on psychokinesis in the same period. (dog barking, helicopter flying) (indistinct shouting) In more recent times, the U.S. Navy had detachment G, and we here at Wytness have been working in the field for, oh, nearly 25 years. (gasping) (dog barking) (breathing heavily) Don't move! (gasping) It is only now, however, that we are able to see behind the curtain. We've bridged the void between the worlds. And through rigorous testing and endless observation, we are on the cusp of propelling human evolution to a staggering new dimension.

(alarm continues) (high-pitched ringing) (♪♪♪) (soft whimpering) (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (♪♪♪) I think you'll be pretty delighted to discover... (sobbing) (♪♪♪) (breathing heavily) (♪♪♪) (beeping) I don't like it. What should we do? Uh, I think we should reset. Let's just see how it plays out. No, no, something's not right... (thundering thud) (eerie screech) (♪♪♪) (muffled groaning) (♪♪♪) (panting) (♪♪♪) (breathing heavily) (♪♪♪) (groaning) (♪♪♪) (grunting) (thudding) (♪♪♪) (sighing) (♪♪♪) Where is everyone? (♪♪♪) I need to get out of here. Okay, they got me in here, so there's gotta be a way out. (♪♪♪) (camera whirring) (♪♪♪) There's gotta be a way out. (♪♪♪) There's gotta be a way out. (sobbing) There's gotta... (dog barking) I think you'll be pretty delighted to discover how far we've come in our important work of developing the human mind to see infinite possibilities. (breathing deeply) (sobbing) (alarm blaring) (gunshots, explosions) (indistinct shouting) (alarm continues) (explosion rumbling) (rapid gunfire) (helicopter blades whirring) (alarm continues) What is this place?

(breathing heavily) (♪♪♪) (sighing) (wood creaking) (footsteps) (♪♪♪) (wood creaking) (panting) (♪♪♪) (whimpering) (♪♪♪) (whimpering) (♪♪♪) (panting) We needed the subject to feel threatened and in real jeopardy. (breathing heavily) (dog barking) But it wasn't until we had developed the Kairos generator that we were able to control the experiment. (breathing heavily) (dog barking) We needed a constant, and that had to be time. (thundering slam) (helicopter blades whirring) (wood creaking) (helicopter approaching) (indistinct shouting) (marching footsteps) (gunfire) (camera whirring) (♪♪♪) (camera whirring) (static popping) (eerie screech) (groaning) (breathing heavily) (groaning) (♪♪♪) - What do you think? - The subject's unstable.

(thundering zap) Repetition of the same day allows us our constant when everything else is variable.

I can hear them at night, I see their lights. I haven't seen them. I haven't seen anyone. Come at night. Just keep moving, okay, don't stop. I'm trying to get to this place, it's, um, a research center. I... I don't know why, but I think it might help. Wytness... ...all started... Wait, did you just say Wytness? That's it, that's the place! Hello, are you still there? Look, if you can hear me, meet me at Wytness. Hello?

(♪♪♪) (wind chimes tinkling) (soft whirring) Every choice you make creates infinite possibilities. Choose what outcome you wanted. (♪♪♪) (dinging) What? (♪♪♪) Oh no.

I'm close, two or three miles from Wytness. - Are you there? - Look, I'll be there in maybe, I don't know, an hour? I'm on foot. They're coming for me again. You need to help me. You need to help me get out of this. Get out of what? What's happening to you? I don't know, I'm in some kind of fucked up game, or something. It's like a test and I can't make it stop.
