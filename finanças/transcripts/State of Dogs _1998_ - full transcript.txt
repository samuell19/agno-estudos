One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I need seven reasons to die. If I'm not inspired to write an original verse If I can't sense the beauty of low hills If I turn my head to the red light at dawn If I don't feel like tasting lips and breasts If I hear alien sounds disturbing my dreams If I'm seduced by someone else?s false paradise Or if I want to escape from this foolish life Then I wouldn?t hesitate to choose death. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I need seven reasons to live. If I'm inspired to write an original verse If I sense the beauty of low hills If I enjoy the red light at dawn If I feel like tasting lips and breasts If there are no alien sounds disturbing my dreams If I'm not seduced by someone else?s false paradise Or if I want to live this foolish life. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven hundred years. You can see me anywhere, anytime. I am here now. I am nowhere. A long time ago, people were offered the water of eternal life. But the giant dragon Rah stole it and drank it. The sun and the moon denounced Rah. And God sent his messenger to kill the evil dragon. But because Rah had eternal life he didn't die. Instead, he devoured the sun and the moon. And there was darkness. The people protested fiercely and Rah spat the sun and the moon back out. But Rah hates the sun and the moon and he keeps returning to swallow them. Good morning. This is the "Voice of Mongolia" radio station. Today's programme is a bit different because of an extraordinary upcoming event. A total solar eclipse will be visible from Northern Mongolia. Many foreign broadcasters have come in the city of Darhan, the best place to observe this phenomenon. It happened not so long ago in the capital of Mongolia. Baasar was one of the many strays that infested the city. He never wanted to live in the streets. He wanted to belong to people. But the people of Ulan Bator stayed away from the stray dogs because they were afraid to catch disease. Still, they accepted to live with the dogs because they were considered good animals. And to kill a dog was a bad omen. This is Baasar's story. The strays bred fast. At night they howled and whined. Dirt and disease spread rapidly and the city officials had to face the problem. They employed a hunter to clean the city. The people disliked the dog killer. They said he was an evil person. They knew that when a dog died he was reborn as a man. Baasar was a clever dog, and survived. But even clever dogs must learn how to die. When Baasar died, he saw a winter landscape, so bright that it was blinding. And in this landscape grew steppes and cities, beauty and cruelty, friendship and betrayal. He was thrown between past and present. It was a playful dance that could have turned into a battle. He stared at his lifeless body on the rubbish dump. The fur smelled of blood and gunpowder. But Baasar's mind was clear. He could think and feel more than a dog could. He was no longer a dog. Baasar stared at the barren city in which he had died. People know what happens to dead dogs, he thought. They know that it is best to leave bodies untouched after death. In time the bodies would return to earth. In time the souls would have to come back to this world. But while the dead body was resting on the land, the soul was free to travel. Baasar's soul was free to travel. Baasar shivered as his spirit passed the airport. He remembered when the airport road was built. For the people of the city this was an important road. When it was built, they planted trees along it. They wanted the trees to grow fast. So they put the body of a dead dog underneath each single tree, to make it strong and beautiful. The people were celebrating the end of a cold winter. In the city people cleaned the streets and parks. Children watered the trees, helping nature come back to life again. The most beautiful of seasons is on its way The finest buds are breaking open My Ulan Bator under the fog The thaw is setting in, my darling The thaw is setting in, my darling Warm days to enjoy Lots of birds singing My grandmother is sitting in the sun It has become warm, my darling The thaw is setting in, my darling A soft wind blows through the window A secret longing waves in me My sweet child is playing outdoors Spring is coming closer, my darling... Why do you shoot dogs? Baasar cried out. But the people were not listening. They were busy remembering their ancestors, asking them for help, begging them for favours. Baasar! Why did people ever give him a name? Baasar's mind was crowded with questions. To seek the answers he sank down, back to his past. Back to the time when he was a dog. Back to the endless steppe where he was born. Baasar wanted to remember. He wanted to understand. Naadam. The excitement of Naadam! Baasar had danced around his family on two legs. And, yes, they brought him along. They travelled for days to the Naadam festival. The people of the steppe came from all directions to celebrate strength, courage and stamina. Baasar didn't understand the competitions, but he shared the joy. The people gathered to gossip, to sing and to feast. Baasar was young. His master was complimented on his new strong dog. This Baasar understood. And he was proud. It's a beautiful day. Why are you panting like that? Are you hot? You must be dying of thirst. My poor dog. It's such a nice day and you are panting like that. Your father is gone. I guess he went out drinking. Can you find someone to help us? Yes. Tomorrow we are moving. We will be travelling for at least two days. Once there was a man who at night went to fetch water from his well. In the surface of the water he saw the reflection of the moon. Oh no, he cried, the moon has fallen into my well! He grabbed a big iron hook and tried to get the moon out of the well. The hook got entangled in the weeds of the bottom. The man pulled and pulled until the hook broke and the man fell on his back. And from where he was lying, he saw to his satisfaction that the moon was back in the sky where it belonged. So he went back to bed, dreaming the happy dreams of a hero. There's not a lot of water left in the well. Baasar's master couldn?t understand the unpredictable whims of Tenger, the eternal blue sky. Nonetheless he worshipped Tenger, and the Great Black Dog of Heaven, who was believed to be somewhere between the sun and the moon. It was the Great Black Dog of Heaven who controlled all destiny. In the movement of his heavenly body he dealt out fortune and misfortune to the world. With a turn of his head he changed winter to spring and summer to autumn. Baasar's family moved with the seasons. Baasar trotted behind. Baasar remembered his last days as a sheep dog. He remembered a different kind of danger approaching, a danger he couldn?t keep at a distance. He remembered his master's face, counting money after selling the herds. He remembered the children?s dreamy eyes. Baasar felt something was changing. Many days passed. Baasar had slept with one eye open shivering with cold. As soon as his legs could bare him he got up and ran and ran and ran, until he couldn?t feel his feet anymore. Finally, he arrived in a place where the air was filled with smoke. He didn't know where to go. And so, Baasar became a stray in the city. Milk for sale! Milk for sale! Without knowing why, Baasar thought of a young woman. Her family had moved to the city before she was born. She was a student. She had married young. This was to be her first child. The city was freezing. Underground runaway children kept warm next to the hot water pipes. The power plant growled like a monster. It consumed masses of coal to provide the city with electricity. Baasar remembered how his strength was challenged by hunger. How people began to throw stones to keep him away. The fear of kicks and stones became stronger than his wish for company. Baasar became cautious. He learned that where there was food, there was danger. And where there were people, there was food. The memory of the dog Baasar once was began to fade. He saw many dogs and many masters. In the dogs he saw himself and in the masters he saw a man he once had loved. People too had been thrown into a world they were struggling to understand. Their lives had changed from one day to another. One day the Russians left the country, the next democracy was declared. They learned to buy and to sell in a new way. They learned how to make money. In the new world everything was for sale. Only hats were left alone, even if they were lost. Because it was believed that the soul of a man lived in his hat. The people of the city even found new uses for old bones. In the steppe these bones would have belonged to the dogs. Here, the dogs could take what was theirs, but only if they came early in the morning. A life. My son. Comes. Wants. Goes. Dreams. Rushes. Laughs. Kisses and gets excited. Sleeps. No cares in the world. Father teaches him dawn's name. Father tells a tale at night. Waits. Longs. Misses. Cries. Wants. Greets. Meets. Weeps. Father comes to his son at dawn. Father takes him in his arms at night. Wasting. Longing. Missing. Crying. Wanting. Greeting. Meeting. Weeping. Father comes to his son at dawn. Father takes him in his arms at night. Are you the woman who took care of me when I was suffering? Was it you who brought me milk and cleaned my wound? Why do I know you, asked Baasar? Baasar knew his spirit had little time left to travel. As his body was disintegrating on the rubbish dump, flesh, blood and bones were forming a new shape for his soul to inhabit. This was the outskirts of the city, the border to the open steppe where cows, pigs, birds, rats, dogs and people were waiting for the trucks to arrive. This was where Baasar's old body was rotting away. Baasar saw the Black Dog of Heaven turn on his bad side. Rah was returning to devour the sun. Baasar knew that even if he were to come back to the world of the living, this world might end. She walked so calmly. Baasar wanted to pull her by the arm. To warn her of the dragon Rah, to tell her about his love for her. But Baasar's thoughts were getting lost between the many gods. He no longer knew. Baasar hoped that the gods could hear her prayers. He was close, very close to her. He wanted to tell her about a winter landscape so bright it was blinding. He wanted to protect her like he always protected the people he loved. Baasar knew he wanted to live again but he was afraid. He couldn?t stop Rah. He couldn?t make Rah spit out the sun. He had to rely on man. Today, the world focuses on Mongolia because of a very rare phenomenon. A total solar eclipse will be visible from our country. Many foreign broadcasters have come to the city of Darhan, the best place to observe this exceptional phenomenon. Several "Voice of Mongolia" journalists are already on location. We present their report to you. A total solar eclipse will be visible from northern Mongolia. During this event lamas will pray and people will bang on metal objects to scare away the dragon Rah. It is believed that Rah will swallow the sun to cause the end of the world, unless people manage to scare the mythical dragon Rah away. When red and blue circles are filling the space with long and fine stripes of light. When spiral dark green triangular light is sparkling firm and cutting the space. When strange multi-coIoured lines are cutting the sparkles of spiral dark green triangular light. When very pink square-shaped spots are gathering on the very blue lines. And when under the very bright light the sparkles of dark green triangular light, the very blue lines and the very pink square-shaped spots are disappearing. Then only white and empty space is left. And this white and empty space can be me. Baasar saw a boy and felt they had met before. The boy stared. And Baasar stared. The eternal water was in the dragon Rah. The dragon was bringing eternal darkness. Baasar could hear Rah growl and he knew that if Rah devoured the sun, then... there would be no water, no sun, no moon, no life. The end, the beginning, the good, the evil, the black, the white, the spring, the autumn, the death, the life, the sun, the moon, the night, the time, the food, the god, the future, the past, the fear, the dragon, the power, the beauty, the man, the dog, the sky, the earth, the soul, the destiny, the omen, the poet, the memory.
