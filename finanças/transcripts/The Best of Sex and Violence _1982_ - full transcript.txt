I use them earthquakes to mix my milkshakes. I eat an avalanche when I want ice cream. I punched a hurricane and made it a breeze. I swallowed an iceberg and didn't freeze. I chained down thunder and handcuffed lightning. I'm so damn strong, its sometimes frightening. I grabbed a star traveling a million miles a minute, and slowed it down to the state speed limit. I may not be sweet, but women treat when they see my belief. I got a dog as big as King Kong. The Human Tornado. (dramatic music) Hey.
