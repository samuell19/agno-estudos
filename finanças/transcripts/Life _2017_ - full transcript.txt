This is Dr. Miranda North, quarantine officer on board the International Space Station. Today the Pilgrim capsule, with its valuable Mars soil samples, completes its eight-month return from Mars. Preparing to receive these samples has been the purpose of our mission these last few months. But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged. At 0630 U TC, Pilgrim was struck by debris and veered off course. Rory Adams will spacewalk to establish visual contact with the incoming space capsule, and he will grab it with a remote arm. We've been waiting a long time for this sample, and Rory is placing himself at great risk to secure it. Over and out. EMU at 4.7 psi, pure O2. Is that how you're gonna do it? I wouldn't do it that way. - Dr. Jordan, status? - Come on, faster, faster, faster. Nitrogen at near zero. - Dr. North? - I'm in the airlock. Faster, faster, faster. Come on. Rory, slow to go fast. - Or fast to go fast. - Deliberate. What does she have against fast? Remember, eight billion people. Rory, if you can't save it... Yeah, spoiler alert. I'm fucking saving it. But if you can't, Rory, just push the capsule into deep space, okay? - Do you hear me? - Can you get OCD... Sorry, CDC out of my face? 'Cause I got a big operation. I need to concentrate. - I just want you... - I can't... I can't hear you... - I love you, too. - At all. EMU at 4.7 psi, pure O2. Where's the remote? - Here. The arm's yours. - There you go. - Full manual. - All right, he knows. Let's go. Careful with... Sorry, you know this. Yeah, yeah. No more sorries. - Miranda, to the Cupola, please. - All right, that's it. Yep. David? Are you on your way? On my Way- - Slow, Sho. - Excuse me. How do you say "breathe" in Japanese? This was supposed to be routine. The airlock is sealed. I am walking. 4:35 UTC. After striking debris, Pilgrim non-responsive. Inbound on collision course with ISS. Initiating emergency course correction and manual retrieval. Canadarm online. Transferring control to wireless. Station to Control. - Initiating sequence. - Affirmative. So, the committee? You let me worry about the committee. Where's Rory? He is at risk out there. Easy, folks. Mics are live. You ready, Sho? Thrusters up. Moving into position. I have control of the arm. Your worry lines are showing. Yeah, well, I get paid by the line. - I have a good feeling about this. - Yeah? Rory's gonna deliver that sample. Right to your lab. Prepare for course correction. .050-niner by .076. - Remember your training. - We never trained for this. On my mark. Five, four, three, two, one. New capsule trajectory, negative 0.50. Proximity alert. Proximity alert. Ignore the proximity alert. New station trajectory, negative .32. The capsule will miss us. Just. - Rory'? - I'm still downrange. And it's coming in shallow. Any moment now. Eight, maybe nine o'clock. I'm having fun. - Are you guys having fun? - Rory, if you miss... Yeah, yeah, yeah. If... Just gonna skip off the atmosphere like a flat stone on water. Just fly off into nowhere. It's no harm done. Okay- There. - There. - I see it. All right, here we go, here we go, here we go. This is fun. Rory, you have to move. It's gonna hit you. - No, it's not. - Please, Rory, move. Station to Control. Visual confirmation of Mars Capsule Pilgrim. I used to play catcher, but only in tee-ball. - Rory'? - Not now. Not now. No, come on, come here, come here, come on, come on, come on. Rory? - Rory? - Rory? - He got it. - Yes! Hugh? Cue Instagram! I didn't want to jinx it. Point and shoot, motherfucker! Okay, okay. Mars Capsule in locked position. I'm coming home. This is Mission Commander Ekaterina Golovkina. Tell the committee Pilgrim's landed on Plymouth Rock. The Mars samples are safe and sound. Copy that, Commander. Congratulations. Ready? We are recording. 0640 UTC. Pilgrim wasn't just seeing things in Mars' soil. We're looking at a large single cell. Inert. Unmistakably biological. And, like organisms on Earth, has what appears to be a nucleus, cytoplasm... The cell wall is thick. Those hairs look like cilia. Longer than we're used to seeing on Earth. More like flagella. - What's our temperature? - Minus 110. Start bringing it up. Minus 82. Even quicker. Minus 55. This is some Re-Animator shit. That's a very obscure reference. - Not for a nerd. - Not if you're a nerd. Minus 17. Zero degrees. Come on. Eighteen... Nineteen... 20 degrees Celsius. Nothing. Update? I'm gonna try a different atmosphere. Closer to Proterozoic Earth than today's Mars. Less oxygen... More carbon dioxide. And then, when Sho's ready, a growth medium. In this case, glucose. Come on, dance. Did it just move? Hugh? My God. It worked. You woke it. We're looking at the first incontrovertible proof of life beyond Earth. It's beautiful. Our first question is from Allen. He's nine years old. And, Allen, what is your question for Commander Golovkina? Is it green? It isn't visible at all, actually. It's microscopic. A single cell. To put it into perspective, your body is made up of trillions. There's an alien inside of me? I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so. Well, we have another question from 8-year-old Mari. Are you bringing the alien back to Earth? No, we're gonna keep it up here. We're gonna study it where it's safe. Commander? The ISS is the most expensive house ever built. $200 billion American and counting. Because we keep adding rooms. It flies around Earth 16 times a day. In 30 years, over 100 people have lived here, thanks to generous countries like Russia, the USA, and China. We call this Tranquility Node. Dr. Jordan here is about to break the record for consecutive days in space. Four hundred and seventy-three, straight. Your mommy must miss you. She does. But I have family here. Yeah, the kind that teases him 'cause his mommy misses him. This is one of our newest crew members. Miranda North from the Centers for Disease Control. She's a doctor, too. You guys are witnessing a space triathlon. Yeah, I'm winning. We have another question from 7-year-old Leila. We think this question is a little personal. - Go ahead. - How do you go to the bathroom? Funnel tube, and some suction. Everything we do on the ISS is like everything you do on Earth. Except different. Do you like peas? Yep. So, have you got a name yet? For that, we want to go down live just outside our studio in Times Square to one very brave classmate. - Hi, Dominique. - Hi. Calvin Coolidge Elementary was chosen among 11,000 schools for this honor. We name the Martian after our school. "Calvin." Control? Control? If you're listening, and you probably are, 'cause you're creepy that way, can I just rant for a second about the micromanagement? We're not blood-filled meat puppets. I come from a long line of plumbers. I can fix a shower. If I can't... Well, Hugh doesn't shower anyway, he's British. - First international incident. - I'm not being critical of you. You're just a very under-bathed nation. Everybody knows it. Don't be an ugly American. Who's ugly now? I nailed Step 17. I'm a very good-looking American, you know? I see, it's right there. Control, I'm sorry about him. Rory, Control can't hear you. I don't know where rage like that comes from. - Can you please fix the shower? - Twenty-eight steps to fix a shower. You know, I can do this myself. No, I know. You just haven't. Doctors are always so bad at looking after themselves, aren't they? You've spent too much time up here, David. Your atrophy's accelerated. And you're close to your radiation limit. You noticed any glowing in the dark? I like it up here. When I was in the military, we'd go to Syria. You know. We'd set up a hospital, treat all the casualties, and then we'd come back a week... A week or two later, and then the whole village would just be bombed out. Then Earth isn't all Syria, though, is it? I can't stand what we do to each other down there. But it's home, and it's beautiful. Don't you miss anything? Don't you miss fresh water or birds or the trees? I like the hum up here. And the air. What you have achieved with Calvin is remarkable, Hugh. I haven't had a chance to say that. Thank you. I think these will prove to be the greatest days of my life. I wish I had a time machine, so I could visit the 10-year-old me. Did he want to be an astronaut? He wanted out of the wheelchair. And how does he feel now? Like a bird. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate my chair. I love it. For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it. You're one of a kind, Hugh. Good night. 11:20 UTC. Hold on to your helmets. The glucose intake is very rapid. The specimen's cells have begun to move together en masse as a unit. They're also sharing electrical activity in what resembles a growing neural network. Notice I didn't say "brain." Dr. North speaking. It is our educated opinion that this new species is not a colony of fast-dividing single-celled organisms, but one larger, solitary organism composed of trillions of identical cooperative cells. Here's what's fascinating. I mean, it's all fascinating, isn't it? Unlike most multicellular organisms, every cell of Calvin's can perform every somatic function on its own. Every single cell is simultaneously a muscle cell and a nerve cell and a photo-receptive cell. So the creature, as a whole, is, in a very real sense, all muscle, all brain, all eye. As such, Calvin now possesses the means to interact with its environment, including the use of what appears to be proto-appendages. I'll demonstrate. But notice how it's approaching and not retreating. Its curiosity outweighs its fear. That's beautiful. Hello, Calvin. How's that feel, Hugh? You're gonna be a daddy. There's gonna be a big custody battle over this one. One day, we're all gonna die, and I want to know if there'd be even the possibility of having... I'm getting a little nauseous. You can do this, Kazumi. I'm doing my best. It's coming. Any moment now, okay, push. Easy for you to say. You can do it, Kazumi. You can do it, you can do it. Sho... I can see it. Okay, push. It's okay. Push. You'll be able to meet Mei soon. You can do it. "And that there was more of it during the night." "We can observe, too, how the recollection of a dream," "which was still lively in the morning," "will melt away, except for a few small fragments..." This book doesn't have pictures in it, does it? Obviously not. Would you prefer that I don't read it out loud? - That's beautiful. - Beautiful. - He makes me cry. - Hi, guys. Guys. - Meet Mei. - Hey! - Hi, Mei! - Hey, Mei! - Say hi to everybody, Mei. - Hi, Mei. - She's beautiful! - Congratulations. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Do they have any idea who the father is? - Shut up. - Another one, another one. Okay. For story time. It was my favorite. You might say my first foray into space. - Thank you so much. - Thank you, Commander. - Thank you, guys. - She's beautiful, Sho. Thank you! No, seriously, that kid had blue eyes. Fuck. It's the lab. Okay. Miranda, check the O2 in the lab. Is it... O2's on 21. We're clear for contamination. We're okay. Calvin's safe. I don't understand how this happened. Nothing in that lab can malfunction. A clamp. It failed. - It's on me. - Yeah, no shit it's on you. A dizzy 5-year-old could have spotted that. Protecting these firewalls, yes, that's my job. But I can't do it alone. Kibo wasn't designed for strict firewall lockdown, and neither was the station. There is zero precedent for any of this. But you do not come out of that lab without triple-checking everything. You do not go into that lab without a proper rest. For all I know, we're carrying anthrax onboard. You can't compare Calvin to anthrax. Yeah, I know at least five guys back home who can do my job. Nobody can do yours except you. I don't want to be around that thing. I'm not qualified to be around that thing. - I understand. - Good. I'm just saying you can't compare Calvin to anthrax. Stop... Stop calling it fucking "Calvin." We don't know what that thing is. Yeah? And you're in there, and you're playing around with it like it's your buddy. I'm your buddy. You're drunk on this. Wake up. This isn't and will never be a controlled experiment. So let's all agree we made our first and last mistake. I miss my fucking dog. Good night. Dr. Miranda North, quarantine officer, 2320 UTC. After weeks of stunning growth and activity, Calvin is completely inactive. We believe it's likely due to the clamp failure in the lab, which caused a temporary change of air pressure in Calvin's box. Our working theory is that this hibernation may be a defense mechanism. Everyone here is on edge, and Hugh, of course, has been beating himself up, but, honestly, I'm relieved. Calvin was growing very fast, and this has now given me time to reinforce firewall precautions with the crew. The box must stay sealed, the lab must stay sealed, no matter the risk to Calvin. It's just floating. Because of my mistake in the lab. And it was going so well. What? Something my dad used to say. "It was all going so well." I'm toying with the idea of stimulating it electrically. - What do you think? - That's not my call. But if it were? I don't know. My job is lines of defense. Imagine the worst thing that could ever happen, and then the worst after that, and the worst after that, and then I... - I've planned for all of them. - I understand that. But risks are taken for reasons. Because of Calvin, we're gonna learn so much about life. Its origin, its nature, maybe even its meaning. - No, I know. - You're a doctor. Stem cell research. What if Calvin could make stem cells obsolete? Help cure the incurable... Reverse the irreversible. I have to fix this. Good. Are you ready? - Stretch. - Okay. And relax. Ready. You sure it won't hurt it? It's a very, very low voltage. We're only stimulating it. What exactly are you hoping for? I'm hoping to wake him up. We're seeing under what conditions it reengages with its environment. Come on in. We're shocking the monkey. Trying another spot. Nothing. Not even at a cellular level. Are you sure it's not dead? It's alive. It's just in a deep sleep. Come on, Calvin. Wake up. Shit! What's wrong? It broke the wand. I'm gonna try and pull my hand out. Do that, but just make sure to protect the glove. - Shit. - It's gripping the glass. Okay, Okay- Little sod. How hard is it holding on to you? - Like a firm handshake. - It's fine. It doesn't hurt, but it's growing strong. - What's the problem? - It's got Hugh's hand. His heart rate is at 165. - Sho, can we trust the glove? - It's very tight. Glove's not going anywhere. It's fine. Shit. Okay, but just relax. Tell him to relax. - Derry? Derry, look at me. - Tell him to calm down. Look at me. Relax. Just relax your hand. Okay- It's in between my fingers. Can I make a suggestion? Can I just... Can I go in there and get him and... No, you're not going to go in there. No, of course you're not, because we have to maintain quarantine. - Stop. - No, I can do this. I can. I can do this. - Can you try and distract it? - Yes, yes. I'll see if I can interest it in the wand. Come on, my favorite little Martian. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. He lost interest. It's got hold of my hand. - Hugh? - Hugh? Hugh? "Hey, Hugh? - Hugh?" Help me! Help me! - What the fuck is going on? - No, no one's going in! - Come on. Who's going in'? - Wait! - Wait for fucking what? - Screw it. I'm going in there. Don't do this. I don't give a shit about your fucking quarantine! There's nothing to protect you. You're not going in there. Who gives you the fucking jurisdiction? - Just open the door, Rory. - Wait, wait. You're not going in there. - Let him in! - You're not going in there. No. - Wait, wait, wait. - You're not going in. He's out. He's out. Guys, look at it. Jesus. What are his vitals? 126 and dropping. What's it doing? Holy shit. Jesus Christ. You guys got eyes on it anywhere? Okay, there. There. Guys? Fuck this. - No! - Let him go. Hey, buddy. Watch his hand. - There we go. - It's there. Get him in. Adams! - Yeah. - David, I need you here. Rory, I can't let you out. Shit. Oh, gosh. - There we go. - Hugh? Hugh? - Look at me. - Just listen to me for a second, okay? Hey, guys? Sho, can you find a bandage? Suggestions? Get an oxygen candle. - Burn it off. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just look at me. Look at me. It's fine. Fuck. Okay, all right, what now? How do we get him out? We need to get Calvin back behind Firewall One, and once he's there, we can pull Rory out. Fuck this. Permission to fucking kill the thing. Commander? Kill it. She? - Any suggestions? - What about the incinerator? I like that. All right, genius. Here. Close the red valve. Disengage the clamp. Disconnect the hose. Be careful, Rory. - Fuck! - There's limited fuel. Copy. Okay- - Manual override. - Thank you. Okay. Rory, I... Yeah. Fuck! You're wasting too much fuel. No! Fuck. Rory! Rory! Hey! Rory, stop. Stop. Rory! Rory? You're out of fuel. It's behind you! - Jesus. - Fuck. Somebody open the fucking door! Open the portal now! Just open the portal. There's a man in there getting strangled. - Rory? What is he saying? Rory? - I can't, no matter what's happening. Kat. Kat! We got to open the door! - No! No one's going in! It's protocol! - Rory? - What is this fucking protocol? - Jordan, no! - Just open the portal! - Rory? - There's a man dying in there! - Nobody open the fucking... Rory, look at me, look at me. Rory, we can't hear you if you take your comm out. I need to see what's happening! - Rory! Rory? - Rory! Will you turn around? Can you turn around? There's a man dying in there! We can't hear you if you take your comm out! No! No, you are not going in! - Help him! - Open the door! Don't open the door, okay? Don't open the door! Stay back! I need to see your face. Can you turn around? Can you turn around? Guys. Guys. Sho. That's so much bigger. Jesus. Guys? - Sho. - Guys, it's trying to get out. The CPU overrode us. It's searching for a way out. - The system won't give me access to it. - Full manual. Shut them down, okay? How smart is this thing? It feels the airflow. I can't control them all at once. Then shut them one by one. Seal the lab. - Just shut it down! Shut it down now! - We are on it. Guys, it's gone. - It got out. - Where did it go? Could be anywhere now. Firewall Two has failed. Kat. We need to reestablish quarantine. And get a distress call out. Control, this is Station. Station for Control. The specimen's location is unknown. It is to be considered hostile and deadly. Our intent is to isolate and destroy it in compliance with protocol. We'll continue said course of action unless otherwise instructed. - Please acknowledge and advise... - Kat? Kat. We lost them. - How much of that went out? - Some. I think. There is no way to be sure. Looks like communications just failed. Can we talk to each other? David. It's Kat. Do you copy? Go for David. So, we've lost contact with Earth. I don't think... Wait. Yes, outside communications are down. - Could the sprinklers affect comms? - No. They're independent systems. Can we run a diagnostic from here? The transmitter has failed. But we have to go outside to access it and get Earth back online. Then I have to walk. Let me. No. After Rory, I'm best qualified for walk-and-repair. This is not protocol. It's way too risky for you to go out there and fix the comms. We don't know where Calvin is. You haven't had your nitrogen detox. Your health is my responsibility. - I'll be fine. - Yeah. What is it you say? "Slow is fast," right? Yeah. Slow to go fast. Yeah. Well, that's out the window. We can escape in the lifeboats. Earth is the responsibility. Nothing goes down to the planet. It was stipulated. In writing. What are you talking about? What was stipulated in writing? What was stipulated? David, first things first. When we're back in touch with Control, we'll turn our attention to Calvin. Don't worry. Rate, 61 beats a minute. Pressure, 97 over 53. I'd hate to see you relaxed. But she is relaxed. Aren't you, Kat? Suit's running warm. Like Siberia in summer. I'm at the transmitter. Commencing on-site diagnostic. It's overheated. I can tell. How? I see scorching. I want to check the coolant levels. Is it possible Calvin could have gotten into coolant? Possible. We have to know. - There is the issue. - Commander? It's bone-dry. Calvin is a carbon-based organism. It needs food, water, and oxygen, just like us. We have to consider the possibility it consumed the coolant for food. David, could you list all the water sources aboard? Pure or otherwise. There's plenty of drinking water, there's coolant for the comms, coolant for the CPU... There's coolant for the spacesuits. Commander? Calvin just came out. It grabbed my suit. It's bigger. It's trying to get in. Trust your suit. - Can it breathe out there? - No. But it might be able to store oxygen for a period of time. I'm closing the valve. It's squeezing. Kat. Kat, are you okay? Yes. The suit's thick enough. It's twisting up your leg. Go. Go to the airlock now. Fuck this. I'm headed for the airlock. I'm burning this fucker off. Kat, focus on meeting David. We'll worry about the comms later. She? There's liquid in the helmet. Calvin must have broken my coolant loop. Kat, there is enough coolant. Yes, I know. I know. David, meet me at the airlock. What? Yeah. Go, go, go! It's squeezing harder. Calvin cracked the coolant system in her suit. Commander, Calvin knows exactly what it's doing. It's growing smarter. The liquid, it's blocking my vision. I don't have time. I've got to jump- - Kat, the tether won't reach. - I'm unclipping. - Kat? - No comments! I've got to jump- David, I've taken Kat off the channel. Look, she's not gonna tell you this, but her heart is beating out of her chest. She's drowning. So just be prepared, she may not be rational. Copy that. Sho, I have no time for EVA. I'm using the launch suit. - It's not designed for this. - I know. - There's not enough protection. - I know. Don't worry. - Kat is less than a minute out. - Vent the airlock. - What about decompression? Dust do 'w. - It's gonna hurt. - Come on, do it! - Is your helmet sealed? - Sho! Guys, we are running out of time. Kat, Kat! Don't swallow it. It's toxic, okay? I need you to help me open the valve. We're gonna do this together. Okay? I'm gonna pull down, and you're gonna go clockwise from your side. Okay? There you go. Good, good, good. Don't worry about Calvin. We're gonna get you inside, and we're gonna get it off. David. Kat? No, no, no. Clockwise from your side. Clockwise from your side. Kat, come on. - Miranda? - Yeah, I'm here. She's fighting me! She's turned her lever the wrong way. Pull down... Kat. You're fighting me, Kat. Come on. We got to do it together, now. - Come on. Kat, come on, please. - David. Kat! - Kat. Kat! - Look at me! Just pull on the lever! Okay? Kat, come on! Come on! Just pull down on the lever! - David... - Kat! Come on, you can do this! David, she's doing it deliberately. Come on! Kat! - Kat! - David, stop. STOP- She's not letting Calvin back in here. Kat? Commander. Kat, Kat... What is going on? What is going on? Guys, guys, do you copy? Yeah. - Yeah, I copy. - Okay, okay... Let's keep it together. We may have... We may have an opportunity here. Calvin's ability to survive in that vacuum and temperature is astonishing. But he can't live much longer out there. Sho. Sho. Are you sure that we've lost all communication with Earth? I am sure. All right, then we have to keep it out there. We have a new firewall. David, can you see it? I'll see. - Sho. - Yes? Can you re-flood the airlock? You tell me when. Okay- Did she close that valve? Yeah, yeah, she closed it. Okay. What other way could it get in? The thrusters. The manifolds in the thruster nozzles. If it tries one, we could blast it off. But we'd have to know which. It's too dark. I can't see anything. - Shit. - There must be some way. Thruster sensors. If it climbs in the nozzle, the temperature should move. Should. All right. - There. - Thruster two firing. Miranda, can you reach Tranquility? We missed. Cut it. Guys, it's heading toward... No, wait! No, no, it's heading towards the lab. It's fast. I'm sorry, guys, I can't see. It's okay, we're watching. - Kibo. - Thruster three firing. Come on. Please, please. Quest this time. - David, can you see? - No, I'm... - Thruster five. - Sorry. I'm sorry, I can't... She? What was that? We've burned through too much fuel. - There. - We were already low after the Pilgrim. Doc, listen, all this thrusting, we've placed ourselves into decaying orbit. - Shit. - We'll reach atmosphere soon if I don't get us back to stable. And I'll need the rest of the fuel to do it, - if we even have that much. - No. David? David, we can't risk Calvin riding us down into the atmosphere, okay? But I don't know... Could it survive that? We don't know. It's already gone well beyond what any living organism should be able to survive. If it's between letting it in here or letting it down there, we let it in here. Where are you? We've just let it back in here. Moving us back into stable orbit. These creatures could have dominated Mars for hundreds of millions of years. But now we know that they hibernate with a loss of atmosphere. If we deprive it of air, retreat in Tranquility, and seal ourselves off... And vent the rest of the station. Exactly. No life support, no life. Right. Okay, Hugh and I will sweep from Quest east. And you and Sho scour the poles and lock off each compartment. It will take about four hours to vent all oxygen. - What do we do till then? - We wait. You okay? Derry, look at me. You okay? I'm fine. I remember the day the Challenger blew up. They took us out of school early, I remember that day. It's hard to watch people die. Like... Fireworks. "Up, up" "the long, delirious, burning blue" "I've topped the wind-swept heights with ease and grace" Best eulogy ever. Qty "Don't give me a eulogy." "Give me a parachute." He was my buddy. It's my fault. It's all my fault. Maybe it was your fault, maybe it was my fault, maybe... I don't know, it doesn't matter, does it? Getting this thing on board was a risk, and we knew it from the beginning. I took it. It's just surviving. Life's very existence requires destruction. Calvin doesn't hate us. But he has to kill us in order to survive. Hugh. - Hugh. Hugh. - Hugh. All right, all right. - Hey. - Derry? Hugh? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, because of all the... - Hugh? - Hugh? Hugh? Hugh? There's no output. (God, get the def“). - Get him back. - Okay. - Get him down. - I'll strap him in. - Take off the sling, okay? - Yeah. Sho, get the ACLS kit and the defibrillator. Shit. Here. Prep the defibrillator and get the shocks down. - 360 joules. - Yeah. Copy, 360 joules. Charging. Clear. - Charging. Shooting. - Still fibrillating. Just stack the shocks if you have to. - Go, 360. - All right. Clear. Shit. - Nothing. - Go again, 360. - Go again. Hit him. - Clear. All right. All right, all right. I got output. - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, sinus rate 98 BPM. You really scared me there, buddy. David? David? Fuck. What is this? Stabilizing. Get the plasma cutter. Calvin's feeding off his leg. Shit! Miranda! Go. Get out of here. Let's go! Miranda, let's go! Pull it away from Hugh. Sho. - We'll come back for him! - Miranda! Come on! Let's go! Sho! No! Sho! No! Shit. Hey, guys? Shit. Calvin? We don't know where he is. - Where's Sho? - He'll be fine. We stopped all oxygen venting in the station. Lift me up. Okay. Okay. Miranda. I'm up. I'm coming home, Mei. I know what I feel is not scientific. It's not rational. I feel hate. I feel pure fucking hate for that thing. Calvin. How is that moving like that? He must have swallowed the marker on Derry's leg. Yeah. We can track him. Let's kill this thing. Venting Zarya now. Okay, it's suffocating. - How long do you think that's gonna take? - I don't know. Shit. Proximity alert. Proximity alert. Proximity alert. Proximity alert. Proximity... They're coming. Kat's distress call must have reached Earth. Wait, where are they docking? Shit. - Looks like Zarya. - Jesus, that's where Calvin is. Station to Soyuz. Station to Soyuz, do you copy? Station to Soyuz, do you copy? - Station to Soyuz, do you copy? - Try the flashlight. Come on, come on. They can't see this. Must be too reflective. Shit. What the fuck are they doing? David. David! They're not coming to rescue us. It's Firewall Three. What? Firewall One was the box. And Firewall Two was the lab. And Firewall Three is the station. But we have a new firewall. - What are you saying? - They don't know that. And if Firewall One or Two fail, they have two choices. They can contain, or they expel. They're pushing us out to deep space. They cannot risk Calvin reaching Earth. That was my protocol. I insisted from the beginning, and the committee agreed. They all put their names to it. The list is as long as your arm. Now, protecting firewalls is my job, and if we would have succeeded, we could have gone home. And if we failed... Wait for me, Mei. Sho. He thinks it's a rescue. Oh, God. He's heading towards Calvin. We have to stop him. Sho! Sho, can you hear us? Sho! Sho! Sho! - Miranda! - Sho! She? - Sho! - Take my hand, Sho! Don't let go, Sho! No! No! No, don't let go! Sho! No, Sho! No! "No!" Let 'No! 'No! No! Sho! Sho! Miranda! No! - Come on! - No! Miranda! Miranda! Let's go! The CPU is still up. It's a miracle. We're... We're losing life support The temperature is dropping rapidly. Atmosphere is venting from everywhere, and I don't know how to stop it. Okay, how much time do we have? In here? Two hours, maybe an hour 45... But it... - What? - Fuck. - Fuck! - What? What is it? What? We're... We're not moving into space. The opposite. All that fucked-up thrusting, we're decaying again. What? Sho has a subroutine here. Without any correction in course, which we don't have any fuel for anyway... We'll hit the atmosphere in 39 minutes. We're not gonna survive reentry. Calvin could. It's so cold. My father used to read this to me when I was a kid. "Good night, room." "Good night, moon." "Good night cow jumping over the moon." "Good night, light." "And the red balloon." "Good night, nobody." I remember when I saw my first picture of Earth. And I asked my father where all those... All those lines were. The borders. I really miss him. Good night, moon. Good night, stars. Good night, air. Good night, air. Bait. Calvin needs oxygen to survive. With the O2 levels so low in the rest of the ship, it will be drawn to the oxygen candles. - We can use them as bait. - Yeah. There are two lifeboats, A and B, both set to default entry trajectory. You press the button, they autopilot themselves to the surface, unless somebody... Somebody overrides them from the inside. I use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin into Boat A. I close the hatch. I press the button to give me full manual control. And if I can hold the stick, I can override the flight path. And if I hold it long enough, I can avoid reentry. You fly out into deep space. With Calvin. Yes. Meanwhile, you get into Boat B, you press the button, and if there are no complications, - then it'd take you back home. - No. No, we should lure Calvin together. - No, Miranda. - Yeah. That doesn't make any sense. Why? The lifeboats are meant for one person. And this has been your plan all along. To make sure that, that creature doesn't get to Earth. Then I should be Plan A. No, I'm a pilot. You're Plan B. Listen, listen. I belong up here. I don't want to go back down to eight billion of those motherfuckers. I need you to say you trust me. Yeah? I do. I trust you. Wait here. I'll signal you. Hey! Shit! Shit! Fuck. Okay. This is Mission Specialist Dr. David A. Jordan commanding Soyuz Lifeboat A, 2233 UTC. ISS has entered catastrophic orbital decay. Initiating emergency escape sequence in five, four, three, two, one. Come on, Miranda, get going. Initiating manual override. This is Dr. Miranda North, black box recording in case of death upon reentry. The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts, with a fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumed dead, carrying it out into deep space. My five colleagues all sacrificed themselves to maintain the firewall, so, please, honor them for giving everything to this cause. Mars life-forms should be considered hostile. Do not underestimate their intelligence and their adaptive capabilities. Now, we did not learn how to restrain or eliminate it, but if this creature ever reaches Earth, use every available resource to destroy it, or you will risk all human life. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. Come on! No, no, no. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No, no, no! No, no, no, no!
