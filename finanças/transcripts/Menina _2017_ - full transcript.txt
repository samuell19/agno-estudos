I'm amazed. She looks very happy, when you see how she's dressed. For a widow! I never thought she'd hook up with Manuel, the butcher. Go and find your father. What's so funny? It's that fool, Salazar. Salazar won't get that one! That's my drink. Are you looking for trouble? Come on! I was joking! That's right, laugh. One of these days... The feet. That's enough. Here. That's for you. Thief! Stop the music! Is that how you celebrate freedom? The revolution? For God's sake! He's the same, every damn year. Watch it. Long live freedom! Long live freedom! Long live freedom. Miguel! Sing "Grandôla" instead. Never call me France again France has let me down Never call me France again That's my last wish Who is St. Lazarus? What a mess! Goddammit! What's going on here? What is this, a joke? Leave me alone. Get to bed. Are you crazy? You woke the kids up. I don't care about the kids. Okay, Mom? Get to bed! Go to bed, I said! What? Don't you know me? Stop it! You'll break everything. Stop! -Where is it? -Stop it! Where is it? Where's what? Now, tell me where it is! -What? -Where did you put it? What, João? Mom... You hid it. -What, João? I hid what? -Yes, you hid it, but if it's here, I'll find it. João, what's going on. Stop it, Palmeira! My damn passport! Tell me! -What do you want it for? -I want my passport! I don't want to die... -in this crappy country. -I can't believe this. I want to go back home. Now, tell me where my passport is. Now! What do you mean? You want to go now? You can barely stand up. Just go to bed and sleep it off. I want my passport. I want to get out of here. You don't need a passport to go. Just walk out of the house. Go on. If that's what you want, then go. At least you could leave us in peace. Let's go. I told you. He's looking! Doctors and nurses. The sluts. She's showing him her knickers. That's enough! It's disgusting! Come on! Everyone inside. Recess is over! Not too much, though We have fruit We have water You can drink as much as you like Yes, Banga, Banga It's lots of fun You can't have too much It's fresh, it's fruity It's Banga Hey, Luisa, your turn! Come on, Luisa! Okay, I'm coming, stop shouting. These French kids are so badly brought up. We need to get some groceries. How long do we have to sulk with Dad? No one's sulking with him. You fool! You scared me! Yes, I know it's sad. Yes, I just finished the sheets and the embroidery and I'm just starting the place mats, madam. Yes, okay. Yes, I'll bury it. Shall I do soup for tonight, Mrs. Archambault? Oh, no, no, no. I didn't hurt it. I tied him up in the garage and I'll punish him too... Okay. Okay, I'll give him a bath. Okay, don't worry. That's good. Goodbye, Mrs. Archambault, goodbye. Unbelievable. My God! A rabbit, with a hunting dog! Why not keep a fox too? Why don't you cook it for Mrs. Archambault? No, she doesn't eat rabbit. Why not? Rabbit's good. Go and fill the tub so we can give the dog a bath. Please. You don't have to be so formal. Don't say "please" like that. Who cares how you say "please"? When's Dad going to do the bathroom? Luisa? Get dressed now. I need the tub. Pedro? Pedro? Don't mind me! Where did you get that? No, you mustn't touch that. If it gets lost, we've had it. Oh, Pedro! Aren't you wearing your dress? -No... -Come on, get dressed. Pedro, help me with the tub! Your son's gone out. -Did he put the blood in the fridge? -No idea. He just went out. -Luisa, shall I comb your hair? -No, Mom. Stop messing about, João. Get off me! I'm going for a walk. Right, one of your "walks". What's your problem? Take the kid with you. Why would I take the kid? You know why. Where are you going? I'm just going for a walk! Take her with you, no arguments. Luisa? Hurry up and go with your father. No, I don't want to. I'm not thirsty. Don't let her in. She's in love! Hey, neighbor! Are you going on vacation? Ah! The long vacation! Retirement! We're going back to Portugal. Antonio, come inside. Come in, I need you. I was talking to the kid. Whenever I start talking, you have to bother me. Just look at you! You look like Dumbo, with those ears. Okay, Dumbo? Where's your brother? You popped my bubble! -Blow another one. -I don't want to. -Pedro? -Get dressed. Mrs. Palmeira, is Pedro there? He went out. Really? But he told me... It says here that if you sulk and the wind changes direction, your face will get stuck like that. You should be careful. -Isn't that true, Serge? -Yes. Yeah. You see? I'm bored... There you go! That's better. You've got a nice smile. Stop it now. Here, I found it. Keep it. Keep it! -Dad? -Yes? -What's this torn photo? -What photo? You shouldn't tear photos. It's not good. Who is it? Is it you? -Yes. -And who's next to you? It was so long ago. Can't you remember? No, I don't remember anymore. Here, keep it. It's for you. Uma recordação do teu pai. Okay. What's "uma recordação"? "Uma recordação" is... I don't know how to say it. It's so you remember me. But I do. I see you all the time. I know, but... but I'm going to dispear. Dispear? -You mean "disappear". -I know. -Disappear. -Disappear, like a magician? No, not like that. Give me that and listen. I'm sick. My lungs are full of water. Then spit it out. I want to, but I can't. Damn! I'm going to die. It's that simple. That's it. I thought you were going to disappear. It's the same thing. -Shall we go? -Okay. I need to wee. Go on. -Same again, João? -No, thanks. Hey! I'm sorry. I'll do it. Look, Dad! My face is going to be stuck like this! Luisa? I took the red one. Come here. Here's good. Come on, Luisa. The sand's wet here. I'll make you a nice castle, in red. Who was it? -What? -Who was that woman? What woman? Okay... I'm making a road with the rake, like that... See? It's nice. It's a spade, not a rake. Same thing. It's the best, for making roads. Why did she tear the photo? I don't know. -Who was beside him? -I don't know that either. Maybe she tore the photo because it's not my mom. Of course it's not your mom. It's the blonde woman from The Comet. What blonde woman? What comet? From interstellar space? Stop it! The blonde woman from the beach, who wanted my dad. A woman on the beach? Your dad's like mine. He's a chaser. "I'll get to Istres at 4 p.m. on June 20, by bus." -Mom? -Quiet! Carry on. "I plan to stay till October, then go back to Joaquim's, in Portugal. -I hope--" -He's read it 50 times, Mom! Be quiet! Let me listen! Go on. "Your mother." And there's more. "Leonor, send some strawberry jelly with your mother. I'll give her the money. Mrs. Raposo." I don't need her money! I can buy a jar of jelly. Why is Raposo writing? Usually, it's Mrs. Cobra. I mean, really! Can I talk now? Mom, does Dad have a girlfriend? What? What girlfriend? Where are my glasses? A girlfriend like you, for example. I'm not his girlfriend? -When is she arriving? -4 p.m. -Does he "chase"? -Yes, yes, yes, stop it now. Okay, read it again. I want to be sure there's no mistake. "I'll get to Istres at 4 p.m. on June 20, -by bus." -Pedro. Show some respect. I've read it 20 times. That's enough. -So, he's a chaser. -Don't be silly! Can I work? Ah! There they are. I don't know what you mean. You shouldn't wear glasses that you found lying about. Stop being so formal! She's your mother! That's how Portuguese people talk! It shows respect! You should do the same! It'd make your grandmother happy. -I can see fine in these. -But I was born in France! I can read! If that's your attitude, I won't talk to you. You look ugly in those glasses! She's got a nerve, that girl! That's my mom and me, when I was little. Don't be silly. It's true, if I want it to be. Why are you changing? I am going into town tonight. Ah. So you go out for walks too. -Do I have to come with you? -No. Definitely not. I'm going with a stunner. -A what? -A stunner. A stunner is... It's like a princess, but more... but more beautiful. Can you scratch my back? -Okay, but not for long. -For a long time! Luisa? Get your dad. It's time to eat. Dad? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'll eat you up! Is she tall or short? About average. With long or short hair? Long, down to there. Does she have big boobs? I don't know. Of course she does. Why do you ask? I'm drawing the woman from the beach. The blonde from The Comet. If you like. Let's have that photo. -That's how the cops catch murderers. -Sh! Sit down here. Murderers? Pedro? Know any blondes? I know loads. One who's about average height, with hair to there, -and pretty. -Very pretty? -Yes. -A stunner? -Yes. -With a big chest? -How did you know? -Here she is. The best looking woman. She's with me every night. That's not her. Oh, no... Oh, no! I forgot we were supposed to choose and learn a poem. That hurts! -I hate learning by heart. -Is someone picking you up? Yes, my brother. He's so annoying. He's always late. My mom's coming to get me. We're having dinner with Granny Pierrot. What's she doing? -Look, Sarah, I found it. -What? -The blonde from The Comet. -Who's that? -About time! -I know, darling. My meeting dragged on and on. Hello, Luisa. You're hot. Come on, let's go. -We need to get the car. -Shall we take Luisa? Are you coming, Luisa? -What's up? -It's her stomach. On which side does it hurt, honey? -Right. -Oh, no! Come on, let's get going. We'll take care of you. Be brave, darling. -Are you okay? -No, it hurts! Be brave, my little samurai! Let's call your parents. We don't have a phone. Okay, just a minute. "Your teeth are alive. Brush them." Consultations. Orthopedics. Hematology. Radiology scanner. Outpatient surgery. Are you coming, honey? Where the hell were you? I was looking for you! I was in hospital. Sarah has appendicitis. And you couldn't wait? Mom would be so angry if she knew! I was talking to my math teacher. He was going on about my homework. You liar! I saw you with that girl! You were making love in the street, at school. Don't say that! Mom would be so angry if she found out! What was that? Get over here! Why are you over there? What are you two doing? Don't say a word. Pedro, help me with this, please. Stop being so formal! I'm waiting for Dad. It doesn't matter how you say "please". My feet hurt. Amen. I can't take these feet anymore! Mom, who's this? What do I know? She's going to take Dad away. I saw her, outside The Comet, at the beach. They were talking together. She's going to take him away. Your father? With that blonde woman? My girl! My girl, my girl, that would be quite a surprise. Your father only likes brunettes. -Wait. -What now? Where did you find that? Dad gave it to me. It's uma... uma recor... da... Uma recordação. I'll make dinner. Are you ready? Shall we do it? Here we go. One, two, three! Push it! Go on! Push, push, push! Go on! Leave that. -Are you going to finish it? -I said leave it. It'll stop when your mother's here, João Palmeira. You let me win again! That's cheating! No, you beat me. You liar! You're the strongest in this house. I can't be! I'm a little girl! No, you beat me three times already. You liar! What's the plan tonight? The Spanish dance, with Belinda. It's no good. Better than the Portuguese. The Portuguese. Pedro? Do you want to arm wrestle? I don't want to, sir. What's up with you? Hand to hand, with your father. -I don't want to, sir. -He doesn't want to. What do the Spanish do better? Mom? Will we go back to Portugal, like our neighbor? Not in this life. I'm never going back there again. Why did he say that? Why did you say that? Why? Come on! Are you scared of your dad? What are you, a little girl? Are you scared of a game? -Don't be such a wuss. -Mom? Will you scratch my back? -Yes, but not for long. -For a long time. Who turned the TV off? Put it back on! I like having the TV on. It seems cold without it. You see, Lita? You're the strongest. Don't forget your castanets. That Spanish nonsense. It's not true, Mom. -What? -That you're ugly in those glasses. You're prettier than Marilyn Monroe. Thanks, darling. You're the most wonderful daughter. Have you started packing? Don't overdo it. I have everything we need. Yes, Mom, you can get beans in France. Yes. Before? No. No, not before. Yes. Okay. Yes, yes. Luisa? Luisa, come here! Now! No, why? No. Okay, you're right. Bye. I'll call after... Hello? Yes? Granny says hello. Okay, yes. Can I call Sarah to see how she is? What did she say when she saw the blonde woman? Nothing. Nothing at all. That bitch put a spell on your dad. That's why. Do some voodoo on her. Stab her photo with something sharp. Every time you do that, it'll really hurt her in her head and her arms and even her boobs. If it works, your dad will start to glow in the dark. I don't like all this joking. What now? He may start spitting, but it doesn't matter. It's the spell breaking. Both glasses are the same. They're not the same. That one's mine. I have all this to finish. It's hard work. You can't read, but your French is better than Dad's. Because I talk, at least. What are you drawing for Granny? You're just scrabbling! Scribbling! Hang on, let's do something. Scribbling, scrabbling. What's that? -"D"? -And that? That's "a". "D,a..." -"m, a, n..." -Wait. Listen to the teacher. What do "D" and "a" make? -"D... Da". -Then add another "d" at the end. So? "Da." No. Okay, "D" and "a" makes "Da". And then add a "d" on the end, so you get "Da"... I don't know. It makes "Da". No! It makes "Dad". Here, draw. Draw. Here. This is for you. Thief. You thief! When we go back to Portugal, we'll have a yard with carnations. -Carnations! -Yes. Your breath smells. Thief! Thief! You're annoying me. Sit down. It's nothing. Nothing! I tidy up! I'll do it. Sit down! Don't just stand there! You're in the way! Sit down! Who's my little girl? -My darling. -Here. Sit back down. "Dad", "Mom", "Luisa". That's good. Beans and chorizo. That's good. Want some? She already ate. Are you just going to... Are you just going to look at me? You put on a show, but you don't want people to watch. I want to eat. -Please. -Ah. Please. He wants to eat in peace. I want to eat in peace. If you wanted to eat in peace, you should've been on time. We ate in peace. Alone! Ask your daughter! Have you finished? Not hungry? Maybe you're still thirsty? What do you think? Do you think I don't know what you've been doing? Where you were? Drinking and spending money, instead of saving it for your family. Be quiet, you filthy woman, be quiet. What? Filthy woman? I'm the filthy woman. Right. Filthy woman! I should leave you on your own. No wife and no children, eh? The good life! You're so selfish! -Quiet, dammit! -Dad, my glass! Christ! Everyone here just shut up! It's only a damn glass! Goddammit! Whether I'm eating or not, people bust my balls! What do you want? My bucket. Wait. Go away and play. Go on. Will you help me? Hold the bowl like that. If I catch whoever it was that did that to my bike! Again! That's good. Why is Dad mean to you? There we go. You can lick the bowl, if you like. It'll be easier when he's gone. He's not going. Your dad's not mean. It's the drink that makes him mean. If he didn't go to the café... But... That's how it is. I have an idea. Pedro! Do you know who St. Lazarus is? That's to play with while you wait. And for your poetry... Pedro? -There. -Pedro? I want to know who St. Lazarus is. There you go. The names are at the end. Carole? Carole? I'm coming. "St. Lazarus: friend of Jesus, resurrected by Jesus." Hi. We're going to do our homework in my room. Why not do it at the table? It's not so comfortable. Stay here and do your thing, okay? Your sis is pretty. "You're more beautiful than the sky and sea..." Where's your brother? Where are the bike keys? The keys! Now! I have no idea. What? Joaquim... Come here. Who was that girl leaving my house? A friend. We were doing homework. Ah, a friend. A whore. You bring your sluts here, with your sister here. Is that funny? Speak Portuguese, so I can understand. Do you understand that? If you want to laugh, I'll make you laugh. Dad, Dad, Dad! I found your keys! Dad, Dad! I found your keys! -Where were they? -On the floor. Just stay there. Mr. Palmeira, I found a mouse, spying on you. Pedro has got another girl. She's a stunner. Her name's Carole. Carole's a French name. You can go back home, you dirty Portu-- Pelée's going to be a mom. She'll have at least four babies, maybe five. In Portugal, I had a little cat and a big horse. You see? The wood needs to be smooth and clean. Do you want to try? You see? No one else in the village had a horse. His name was Thunder. He was really... He had a voice, when he went... Everyone was scared. I mean everyone. Even your mother. See? I only ever saw your mother scared with Thunder and when I did the salto. What's the salto? When you come from Portugal to France, hang on... There are big mountains here and you can't get over them. There's a magic zone. And there's a gatekeeper magician there. He asks for your ticket. I showed... the torn photo with your mother. Mom! The photo of your mom. And I jumped. I jumped really high, high into the sky. And I said: "I want to go to France!" And I landed here. I gave the torn photo to the gatekeeper magician and he jumped back over and gave it to your mother who had the other half, so she knew I'd got to France safe and sound. So she wasn't scared. Why was she scared? Because it was dangerous. How can I put it? Sometimes you do the salto, but you jump so high, so high up that the mountains and houses look so small. You're up in the sky and the sky's really beautiful. And you get lost. You get lost... and you stay there. You become a star. That's true. Have you ever seen... when a star goes like that. It's... a shooting star. Have you ever seen one? No? Of course you haven't. They're very rare. They aren't stars. They're people that got lost in the sky, but, luckily, they manage to fall back down. Yes... I'm going to do another salto. Maybe I'll get lost. You never know. Will you become a star? Yes. That's right. I'll be your star. Your lucky star. But sh... -It's a secret. -Dad? Yes? When are you going to do the bathroom? Tomorrow. -Shall I tell you a secret? -Yes. I'm going to have a half-brother or sister. Why's that secret? My mother doesn't know. Will you tell me a secret? Er... my mom's a thief. That's why she came to France. Because the police were all looking for her. And she tore up her photo so they couldn't identify her. It's true. She's incognito. -That can't be true! -It is! Hey! Stop it! Did you try the voodoo, with the chicken blood? No, I don't want to. And we only have pig's blood at home. -That's better than a chicken, dopey! -Dopey yourself. -You are! -No, you are! -I'm Zorro! -No, you're Richard. I'm not. I'm Zorro! That's so silly! No! There's my dad! Does your dad have a motorbike? And it's red too! You're so lucky. Luisa? Let's go! Basically, the land starts here and goes on to the almond trees. They come with it. Those almonds are good. In fall... It's just a fly. Portuguese? I like the Portuguese. They're hard workers. Even cats aren't scared of flies. How do you water it? Ah, the watering. There's a spring there, at the bottom. It'd be easier with a pump, for sure. And I think that's everything. He could put a shed, down at the bottom. Nothing hard, though. Just wood or corrugated iron. What do you think? It's good. I'll think about it. -Keep me posted. -Yes. -See you soon. -Thanks. João, João Palmeira. Miss. -Bye. -Bye. -Thanks. -Sure. Isn't it nice? I'd like a yard. Are you going to live here? Are you moving out, Dad? What? What are you doing? Luisa? Luisa! Luisa! Luisa Palmeira! Calm down! Come here. Do you remember what I said the other day? At Serge's, in the café? -Do you remember? -You're a liar. You'll never do the bathroom! You're coming here, with the blonde woman from The Comet! -What? -With the woman from the beach. That's what you're planning! That's what you want! -A new house. -What are you talking about? Tell the truth! Just say it! -You're moving in with that blonde. -Yes, it's true. You're clever. You rumbled me. I'm going to come to live here with the blonde from The Comet. Stop laughing. Stop laughing! Stop coughing! Stop laughing! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop coughing! What's that cough? Are you sick? Are you coughing too? Hot milk and honey for everyone tonight. Have you finished? Are you on a diet? Agnès's brother has a car-shaped bed. Funny, eh? Someone needs to do the chorizo. I'll do it. When? When my mom gets here? By the way, Pedro, Granny will need your bed. I want that room tidy, both of you. -Agnès got a Barbie. -That's true. Pedro, come here. What's this toothpaste here? That's not toothpaste. That's hair cream. Did you brush your teeth with it? Yes! Stop! Leave your mother alone. When you love, you have to go. Leave your wife, leave your child, leave your friends, boys and girls alike, leave your lover, male or female. When you love, you have to go. Leave your wife, leave your child, leave your friends, boys and girls alike, leave your lover. When you love, you have to leave. Leave your wife, leave your child, leave your friends, boys and girls alike, leave your lover, male or female. There's air, wind, mountains, water, sky, earth, children, animals, plants and coal. Learn to sell and buy, and resell, give, take, give, take. -Nice design, eh? -Belinda... You can't just take my pencils! Those are mine. You can't just take them! When you love, you have to know how to sing, run, eat, drink, whistle and learn to work. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. When you love, you have to go away. Don't cry while you smile. Don't huddle between two breasts. Breathe, walk, leave, go. I take a bath and I watch, I watch the mouth I know, the hand, the leg, the eye. I take a bath and I watch. I want to stay in France. I want to stay. The whole world is always there, life is full of surprises. I come out of the pharmacy, I just got off the scales, I weigh 80 kilos, I love you. Blaise Cendrars. That's it. Thanks, Luisa. Is she going to die? No, it's starting now. The kittens are going to be born. Don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die. don't die, don't die, don't die... -Stop. -don't die, -don't die, don't die, don't die... -Sh. don't die. St. Lazarus, a friend of Jesus, resurrected by Jesus. I do the salto. If I drink pig's blood, don't die. He doesn't die. Mom, your visits to your family are none of Mrs. Raposo's business. Those people don't have... Pedro has always slept in the living room! Everyone's expecting you! Pedro doesn't care! Why are you saying this? Hello? Mom. Mom. Isn't she coming? Mom? Dad's got water in his lungs and he's going to die. Aren't you ashamed to say that? What did I do to God to deserve a daughter like this? Is that a way to talk to your daughter? To your mother! You kill yourself, working for others. For others, constantly! Where am I in all that? Everything revolves around others! Are you the center of the world now? Are you the center? What do they know about us? They know nothing of our lives here! A whole year, waiting, in solitude! In a foreign country, with no money to go back home. That stupid baker woman! I'll say it in French... okay? She always makes me feel bad. She makes me feel inferior. Always apologizing. "Sorry, madam!", "Thank you, madam!", "Excuse me, madam!", "Yes, sir!" The Portuguese this, the Portuguese that! The Portagees! Why don't you believe me? Dad's going to die. Like the kittens. Calm down. Just calm down. He's going to die and I'll be sleeping. Mom? Do you love me? What about you? Do you love me? Come on. That's for you. A desk, to do your homework. I hope I made enough drawers. I put a groove in there for your pencils and pens. That'll stop them falling. Thanks. You're better than me, son. Better than your dad. Is there film in it? Of course. Do you think I'm stupid? He won't come for his daughter. Ow! You're pulling my hair! It's almost my class's turn. Just wait a bit, Luisa. -Hello. -Hello, Mrs. Palmeira. -Do you have a moment? -This is Pedro, my son. This is the headmaster. Hey, it's about to start! Your husband's been hospitalized. He's in a critical condition. Why can't I dance with Luisa? It's a last-minute change. Go back with the others and dance with Bénédicte. Luisa, go with your mother, okay? No! I want to dance with Luisa! Come on, don't make this hard. Let her dance, please. Please. At this point, all we can do is reduce his pain. We had to increase his morphine. It's helping. There's nothing you can do? You can't let him die. We've done everything. There's a risk he may not wake up. I'm sorry. He'll suffer less. The doctor is coming. Thanks. Thank you, madam. Luisa? It's Luisa, right? You can go to your dad, if you like. He'll hear if you talk. I'll do what I like. Be careful, can't you? Haven't you done enough? What a disgrace. Look at your dress. I won't change it, that's for sure. You won't get another one. Why did you do that? Why did you hit your friend? What does it mean? Is that who you are? Don't I have enough problems with your father? Why didn't you say? You knew he was sick and didn't say. Why, Luisa Palmeira? Why? I'll buy you a nice dress, my daughter. I'll buy you a beautiful dress, darling. A beautiful princess's dress. A beautiful princess's dress. Forgive me, my daughter. Are you here, you thief? I'm not a thief. You're a thief. You stole my heart. I never managed to take yours. I need some air. I'll let her sleep. I'll come with you, Mom.
