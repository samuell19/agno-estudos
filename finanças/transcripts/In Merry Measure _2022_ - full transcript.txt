Christmas is such a special time, and it's a time to spend with your loved ones, which is why I'm so grateful that you chose to spend it here with me tonight, at A Very Darcy Christmas. I've got one more song for you. Play "Sugar Rush"! Um... And again, I just... I just want to say how grateful I am that you are all here, and I hope that you will sing along with this one. ♪ Sugar rush, sugar rush ♪ With every kiss ♪ Lips like licorice ♪ Strawberry-candy kiss ♪ You got me looking for a sugar fix, sugar fix ♪ ♪ Lips like bubblegum ♪ And I gotta get me some ♪ I'm so addicted I just can't resist ♪ ♪ And every time you go away ♪ Your candy-coated kiss is all I can taste ♪ Oh, thank you for coming. Thanks so much. Hey! Younger fans. That's what we like to see. Oh, Darcy. I'm such a huge fan. Would you mind? One is for me and the other is for my friend. We went to the first-ever "Very Darcy Christmas" back when we were kids. Oh! Did you enjoy the show? Tell you what. Um, I'm going to give you this for free, as long as you promise to play it for your friends. - Deal? - Amazing. Is "Sugar Rush" on there? Uh, no. It's all new songs. Still! So great. Thank you. Merry Christmas! I didn't know they still made CDs. Hello. Oh... ♪ With every kiss ♪ Sugar rush, sugar rush... Hi. Whatcha doing? Hey, sis. I just did "Very Darcy Christmas." Mm! Doesn't your agent usually book that a little closer to... you know, Christmas? Oh, if I still had an agent, maybe they would have. Oh... sorry, I didn't know. Mm, it's okay, it happened around the time of... Well, happened around March. Yeah, I don't think I would've cared much about your agent problems in March. You still there? Yeah! So... I was calling because Megan is trying out for the Herald Angels. My Herald Angels? For the Christmas Carol Competition? Still perform every year. Still win almost every year, too. They lost some of their strongest singers... Couple of them moved out of town... So they're looking for a few last-minute replacements, and Megan's giving it a go. Oh! That's really exciting. Well, you could always come and see for yourself. Gretchen. Come on, I know you like to keep busy this time of year, but don't you miss all the fun stuff we used to do as kids at Christmas? Like, hanging stockings and making gingerbread houses? I think I would have a really good time, and I think that you might, too. And things have been crazy at the law firm, and after the year that Megan and I have had, I just think we could use the... it would be really great to have the company. And I could also use help with the decorating. You know what? Let's do it. Yeah... I'll... I could use the break. I'll come in this weekend. And it'll be really nice after spending a decade of Christmases apart. Decade and a half, actually. You know, I can still change my mind. Hanging up before you can! I love you. I love y... Wait. She... She hung up. Megan! It's so good to see you. Hey, Aunt Darcy. I'll be there in a minute! You come in... I'll bring your suitcase. Oh, thanks. That was the last Christmas before you made it big. I do not miss the matching pajamas. Oh, you are so getting some. Oh... oh. I'm sorry, Gretch. I'm sorry that I haven't been back since the funeral. I know it must have been tough, but I also know that Craig wouldn't want you crying on Christmas. I have a couple weeks before Christmas. I just have to get it out of my system. I'm really glad you're here. Anything I can do to help, just let me know. Okay. Oh, Megan, I have a little something for you... from my hometown. Well, your second hometown, 'cause your first hometown is Dayton, so. An official New York City snow globe. Thanks, Aunt Darcy. Oh, and don't think that I forgot about you. What is it? New York bagels! Aww! These aren't day-olds, are they? Ugh. What am I, a monster? Couldn't you just get some from the store? Okay, the best things about New York City are your aunt, and bagels. I have a surprise for you later also. Ooh! Yay! Is that Tuna-Nuna Casserole? "Tuna-Nuna"? This is your grandmother's famous tuna-noodle casserole. When Aunt Darcy was little, she used to call it "tuna-nuna!" Why? Because I was adorable. Plate. Mm! Oh... I haven't had a casserole in forever. Well, welcome to Ohio. You don't like your tuna-nuna? She's nervous about tomorrow. I heard you can sing. I'm really not that good. She's really good. Mom! What? It's not like your shower is soundproof, okay? You sound really great. What are you singing tomorrow? Can I hear a little preview? Um, I'm resting my voice. Oh... yeah. Vocal rest... that's smart. Actually, I think I'm gonna go to bed, if that's all right. Goodnight, Aunt Darcy. Goodnight, Megan. 'Night, Megan. Craig always used to know what to say to her. I feel like every time I'm trying to build her up, she just gets annoyed at me. You're her mom. She's legally required to find you annoying. And isn't it normal for girls her age to struggle with confidence? Yeah. I mean, you never struggled with confidence, right? Me? Come on. Hey, you've reached Darcy. Sorry I missed you. Darcy, Matt Calabrese here from Gold Vault Records. Hey, I heard your demo, and I have so much respect for any artist out there hustling, trying to get herself back to the top, but the marketing team doesn't think it's quite right for us. But, hey, keep fighting and keep writing! I know you'll have another "Sugar Rush" in no time, so stay in touch. Oh, and Merry Christmas! Morning, sunshine. I just realized that we are out of coffee and is there any chance I could bribe you to go on a coffee run? Sure. I can go to The Coffee Place. - Thank you. - Okay. - Okay, I love you. Bye! - Bye. What is this? A Minty Christmas Mega-Mint Latte... The official beverage of Christmas. We drink our coffee black. Adam. Sometimes, to keep the defense honest, your offense has to run the option. It's too early in the morning for football metaphors. You can't always do things the same. You gotta switch things up from time to time. We come to this coffee shop every morning. Because the coffee at school is terrible. Look. We are officially out of high school football season and into Christmas season. If that doesn't call for a mug of sugary, minty freshness, I don't know what does. There's no way that this tastes good. Well, how about we arm wrestle? If I win, you try the coffee. You will rip my arm off. Then you might as well try the coffee and spare yourself the pain. That's the best coffee I've ever had in my life. Sometimes, you gotta run the option. Wow. Ooh. You will never guess who just walked in. That's Darcy. Well, you think I could get a selfie? You want to get a selfie with her? Why wouldn't I? She's one of the great pop vocalists of her generation. I shouldn't bother her, let her get a coffee in peace. Oh, she's looking right at us. Don't do that! She waved right back. Now she's leaving. And she's smiling. Aha! - Thank you. - Of course. Cheers. Cheers. To you. She's in the zone. Any idea what she's singing? No. Any idea how much she's rehearsed? No. You know I can hear you guys, right? Oh... Okay. Hey! I have to run some errands today. Figured I would swing by the school, see the old stomping grounds... say hi to any of the ancient teachers who may remember who I am. You were a pop star. Everyone knows who you are. I'm going to ignore the use of the word "were" there. Bit of a burn. Just stop. Yeah. Why don't I pick you up right after auditions? We can start the celebration right away. Sure. There you go! Do your thing. - Okay. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Good luck! Mwah! Have a good day. Thank you. Bye, people. Bye. Oh, Principal Dixon! Darcy! My goodness, how lovely to see you. What brings you here? Oh, I'm picking up my niece, Megan. Of course. We've been so proud of your success, Darcy. Any guess what we play at prom every year? "Who Let The Dogs Out"? "Sugar Rush," of course! Some of the kids don't know it's done by an alum, but the chaperones love it. Oh, that's... wonderful. Um, well, I have to go, but it was so great to see you. Of course, of course. Merry Christmas. Hey, and if you ever want to do anything for the school... An assembly, a class... concert? - Oh... - Whatever... My office door's always open. - Oh. Good to see you. - Bye-bye. Megan? Oh! What happened? I got cut. Oh, I am so sorry. I just... I really wanted to sing, but I got afraid, you know? Oh. I know. Believe me, I know. Did you at least get any good feedback from your teacher? No, I... I didn't even get to finish. He cut me off before the chorus. What? He cut you off? He didn't even let you finish? Who is this guy? Of course. Darcy... the prodigal child returns. Adam. Was that you I saw this morning, ignoring me at The Coffee Place? Not hiding. Just enjoying a peaceful morning. You didn't want to say hi to an old friend? If I had seen an old friend, then I would have. Wait. You two know each other? We were in Herald Angels together. We had what some might call a friendly rivalry. Except "rivalry" implies that I had competition. Oh! Why didn't you let Megan finish her audition? Okay. I would think, as a professional musician, you would understand how difficult auditions can be. And I would think, as a professional teacher, you would understand that these are kids. Herald Angels have high standards. It's nothing personal. It's about winning. It's about having fun! And there's nothing more fun than winning. Wow! After two decades, you are still such a piece of work. Megan... you didn't do anything wrong. Okay? You are a hard worker and a good student. You just... you lacked some of the confidence that the others had. I didn't want to waste your time, okay? You know, when I was your age, I lost all the top solos to your aunt, but I, then, graduated top of my class, studied music at Indiana, and now I am the head of a music department that has six consecutive wins at the Carol Competition. Slow and steady might not get you a pop album number-one, but... it does win the race. So, I encourage you to keep working hard. Okay? Darcy. This has been an absolute pleasure. Maybe we could do it again in, uh... 20 years? That wasn't good. She didn't even eat the chili? Oh, it's serious, if she didn't want the chili. I can get a plaintiff to confess to perjury, but I can't even get my own daughter to talk about her feelings. You want to give it a try? Sure. Megan? It's your super-cool aunt. Come in. Do you want advice or silent support? I don't know. I'm just... I'm mad at myself for blowing it. You didn't blow it. Okay? I know he is your teacher, but if he cut you off? Then he doesn't know what he's doing. That's not true. They win every year. It's Dayton, Ohio. Okay? I could win this competition with three decent singers and a chimpan... Do you have any of those at your school? Chimps? Uh, singers. How many people auditioned and didn't make it? I don't know, four or five? Are any of them any good? Yeah, I think so. Huh. I'm not kiddin'... It happened every time! No way! Hey, Jim. You wanted to see me? Adam. Look who's here! Darcy was just asking about the competition. Of course, she was. Uh, Principal Dixon, you asked if I wanted to get more involved in the school, right? Of course! We'd be thrilled. Oh! Awesome. I'm starting a caroling group... For everyone who didn't get into the Herald Angels. That's really nice, but only one group per school is allowed to enter the county competition. Oh! I actually looked it up last night, and the rules clearly state, that if a school has two or more groups, they're allowed to decide who competes with a sing-off. A sing-off? How wonderful! I know, right? You can't be serious. Two weeks from now, in the auditorium. The winning group will sing at the county competition. Okay. Wait. Jim. Jim. Jimbo. I have won this competition six years running. Surely, you can't possibly be entertaining this... this insane idea! A local celebrity involved with the school? Sounds like a great idea. Okay. Fine. It's a sing-off. Okay. I was talking to Megan on the way home... somebody's "Aunt of the Year". Well, you said you wanted me to be more involved with the family. Yeah, I wanted you to, like, help hang ornaments on the tree or play charades. You didn't see her sitting there that day, crying. She cried five times a week, and that was before we lost Craig. She cries at songs, movies, baby animals on Instagram... She's a sensitive soul! Well, so am I. People have made me cry plenty in auditions. It'll be nice to turn the tables on them for once. Are you looking for a win for her, or are you looking for a win for you? Why can't it be both? Don't bite off more than you can chew, Darcy. What if I'm really hungry? Hey, team! I'm Darcy, Megan's aunt. Who here is ready to win? Not the level of enthusiasm I was hoping for, but we can work with it. Okay, everyone, follow me.

Yay. Oh, sor... I didn't realize you were still here. I figured I would stay late, work on some arrangements. Am I in your way? In so many ways, yeah. I'm just trying to be a good aunt. No. I-I know. I respect that. I do. I also know that you heard them sing. Yeah, I did. And I know that you know where I was coming from. Okay, when I was their age, and I was auditioning for scary record labels and executives, I was just like them. Difference is, you were good. No, the difference is, somebody gave me a chance. Kids need to be built up. Where you see kids that aren't ready, I see untapped potential. I see myself. You really see yourself in those kids? Yeah, I do, and if you had given them a chance and let them finish their auditions, maybe you would have seen it, too. You know, for the record... I'm sorry that I cut them off early. I thought I was preventing false hope, but maybe that wasn't the right decision. You've got some great kids in your group, some of them take my class, and I hope you know what you're doing, because I would like to see them succeed. Me too. I don't want them to beat me, of course. Obviously! But I would like to see them succeed in 99% of their ventures in life. That's a high percentage. I'm a nice guy. You started without me? Oh, hardly. Grab some, join in the fun. Maybe with your help, we'll be done before the sun sets. How was rehearsal? Remember when I brought home that report card, with the straight "C" s, and I thought Mom was gonna kill me? But she just looked at it and smiled and said... "I see an opportunity for impressive growth." This group has... quite an opportunity. Believe me. Can you toss me another strand? Yeah. How many do you need? - I don't know. - Okay. Craig always used to do this, and I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how to lay these things out. I'm just trying different things and hoping that it works out. I'd say you're on the right track. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm Okay, okay. If you guys sing any quieter, it will be a literal silent night. Do you know why I moved to New York? Because it's not Ohio? Because I never would've known if I had what it took if I hadn't jumped feet-first into the deep end. And that's what I need you guys to do. What... What are you worried about? Losing. Well, if you worry about losing, you know what'll happen? You'll lose. Great. Now I'm worried about being worried about losing. There is this thing called self-fulfilling prophecy. If you picture something bad happening... If you picture losing... Then you are basically guaranteed to lose. But... it also works the other way. So your homework for tonight is to go home and dream about what it would be like to win. Do you dream about winning, Darcy? Every single night. It's why I sleep like a baby. ♪ Joy to the world ♪ The Lord is come ♪ Let Earth ♪ Receive ♪ Her ki-i-ing ♪ Let every heart ♪ Prepare Him room ♪ Let heaven and nature sing ♪ Let heaven And nature sing ♪ ♪ Let heaven ♪ And nature si...

I'm not worried. You know, I always wanted to be a singer. I still remember my first concert. Celine Dion. Thought maybe one day I'd be able to sing like her, but I was given different blessings. The body of a lineman and the footwork to stop a pass rush dead in its tracks. Why you telling me this? No matter how hard I pushed myself, I was never gonna sing like Celine. And no matter how hard she'd pushed herself, Celine Dion would never have been able to flatten me and sack my quarterback. You're good at what you do, man. - Accept it. - All right. And give yourself the grace to enjoy yourself at the big game this Sunday. You bought me a ticket before asking, didn't you? Yes, I did. Okay, I want you guys to get in the middle of the stage, all right? Okay. So I want you guys to feel the spotlight, okay?

Hey, Megan, will you text your mom and tell her to meet us there? Mm-hmm. They're having so much fun. Is this what it's like in rehearsal? No, they usually start out pretty quiet and nervous, but then once they get comfortable, they're... Oh, no. What's that face? I just had an idea. Oh... that can't be good. Hey, guys. Guys. How would you feel about singing one of our songs... here, right now? Aunt Darcy, I... I don't know... We're having fun, we're in the Christmas spirit, so why not spread some joy and entertain some people? Okay, let's do "Joy to the World", and, Megan, I want you to sing lead. Me? I-I don't think... I can't! I know you can. I'm not saying this as your aunt, I'm saying this as someone who does this for a living. Megan, you can sing. And I believe in you. And your group believes in you. Yeah. And, hey, we've gotta have a first performance sometime, right? So why not get up there and show 'em what you've got? Okay, wait. Hold on. Hi, everyone! Could I just get your attention for a second? Um, I am the coach to a group of very special singers, and we have a very important competition coming up, and we would love to do one of our songs for you. How does that sound? Great! All right.

Like... really good! Thanks. I just can't stop thinking about how great she was. She's a really incredible kid, you know. Yeah. Hey! Is it cool if I hang out with everyone? I'll get a ride home. Sure. Just be back by curfew. Mm. Scouting out the competition, are we? Goodnight, Aunt Darcy. She's so sweet. Working hard, I see. Only kind of work I know how to do. What are you doing here? Same as you. Just gonna tinker with some of the arrangements. I, uh... I heard that your group wowed everyone at Elmo's. They're coming along. A week ago, they were a disaster... and now they're great. Well, I wouldn't say great... What's it like? Having everything that you touch just work right away? When I was 18, I was cooking fries at the diner, headphones in, humming scales to myself, trying to keep it down so that my boss wouldn't hear. Age 18, you... were on a jet to Paris to play "Sugar Rush" for a stadium full of screaming fans. I envy your talent... There is no question about that. In just one week, you took those kids and you made them great. You make it seem so effortless. Effortless? I-If everything was "effortless," you know I wouldn't be here, right? I haven't had a record deal in years, and yet I am working harder than I have ever worked, a-and, frankly, I think I'm a better artist than I have ever been. I have new songs that I think are great, but it seems like everyone is more interested in who I was than who I am. So, yeah, maybe things were "effortless" for 18-year-old Darcy, but that was a long time ago. Can I hear one of the new songs? Absolutely not. You said that you're tired of people asking to hear "Sugar Rush", and believe me, I don't need to hear that song ever again. So, come on, let me hear one of the new ones. Oh! Just, come on, just give me another reason to wallow in my self-pity of how wonderfully talented my competition is. You promise to wallow in self-pity afterwards? Oh, cross my heart! Yeah. ♪ I try being wise ♪ I let myself down ♪ I run around in circles ♪ I do, I do ♪ And I find myself lost ♪ Will you hold my hand ♪ And take me where you've been? ♪ ♪ I'm trying hard to find ♪ A little peace of mind ♪ So please Just take me there ♪ ♪ Take me to a place Where truth is free ♪ ♪ Show me how to let myself Be worth it ♪ ♪ Every day, I feel This war get harder ♪ ♪ I do, I do ♪ Somewhere in this life We'll all be loved ♪ ♪ If one day we could see That we're all worth it ♪ ♪ Let me know there's hope When there's none to see ♪ ♪ Mm-mm, mm-mm If you're not anymore... it's only a matter of time before you're a star again.

This is very West Side Story right now. What... what is happening? What do you mean? My group said that you wanted... We wanted to meet. Both of our groups. Together. We don't want to do the school competition anymore. That's great! I didn't know that you were conceding. Uh, we're not conceding. Are you conceding? No one's conceding. We think everyone should go to the county competition. Together. We want to join forces. Their group is doing some really cool things, Mr. M. I... I think they'd liven us up, make us sound fresh. And with your talent and experience, our group could learn a lot. So if you and Aunt Darcy could just, I don't know, work together... Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, I don't really need an assistant coach. It's hilarious that you think I'd be the assistant. You would both be in charge. Co-head coaches. We have less than two weeks until the competition. It's what we all want. Unless you two really can't work together... Which wouldn't be setting a very good example for us impressionable teenagers. And wouldn't exactly be in the Christmas spirit. Okay, I'm in. Thank you! Mr. Macdowell? Yeah, okay, I guess it wouldn't be so horrible to work together. You're not gonna regret this, I swear. After you. Think this'll work? It's what they want. You think your kids can come along quickly enough? I think so. Good. Okay. So you know, we get three songs for the show, so we can do one of my songs, and we can do one of your songs. Sounds fair. And then we just need a third song. Right. Well, we don't need to decide right now. We're getting along. Same team. - Right. - Mm-hmm. - Same team. - Mm-hmm. This'll be... fine. It'll be fine. Okay! Let's get focused here, we're about to start. Okay, let's have some fun, guys. Let's warm up. Start shaking it out. Just shake it out. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Shake it out. I did. I'm shook. Well, that's new. Hey! Hi. Ah... how'd it go? Great. You knew about their scheme? Of course. I'm the one who told them to hold the meeting outside. You always establish a neutral location for mediation. So, you're just in time. I'm doing the stockings. I'm the reindeer, Megan is the penguin... and now we just need to choose one for you. We have lots of options. We have this... your stocking from when you were a child. Okay. We have... this collector's item. Oh, no. Burn it with fire. Uh, let's see... What about this one? Oh, um... That was Craig's, but if you want to use it, that's fine... No, no. I, um... I'll tell you what. Why don't I use this one, but if it's okay with you guys, I... think we should hang this one, too. Be nice to have it there on Christmas. Yeah... I'd like that. You okay with that? Yeah, I think that would be nice. Okay, great rehearsal, you guys. You are done for the night. We're gonna go hang out... work on our parts. I'll get a ride home. Freddy, are you a good driver? Yes, ma'am. Please, don't call me ma'am. It makes me feel old. Uh, yes, ma'am. "Miss." I... I'll just go. - Yeah. - Okay. Don't do anything I would do. See ya. So what are your plans for tonight? Oh, I thought I would reheat some pasta, watch Home Alone for the first of a 12 times this week, with Gretchen, stare at my phone, waiting for a record label to call. That sounds like a busy night. Never a dull moment. Let's go get a beer. Hmm! That sounds much better than reheated pasta. Oh... I'm liking the Christmas spirit in here. Oh, yeah, this place is a lot of fun around the holidays. Everyone's in costume for Halloween, everyone dresses up as Cupid for Valentine's Day, and everyone looks depressed for the Fourth of July. Why depressed? - It's a British pub. - Makes sense. Uh, can we get two beers? We're going to go to the patio. Thank you. You are so great with the kids. It pains me to say it... It kills me to say it... But you are a natural. Oh, yeah, I've been doing music for so long on my own, I forgot how much fun it is to be part of a team. You know, even at high school, before the Herald Angels, I used to love going out caroling with my friends. My mom used to push us to go out and, you know, "spread some joy." That's nice. My parents were... they were hard. They would push me. Especially my dad. So I grew up feeling that I had to be the best at everything, and... man. You were so good at everything. It was a really hard time for me to see someone so clearly headed to the top and I had to work so hard just to stay out of the bottom. I had no idea you felt that way. It's not like I could say anything. I was 16. I was insecure. Well, maybe I should've tried to get to know you better. But I thought that you didn't like me, so why would I try? Why would you have cared if I liked you? I was 16. I was insecure. Well, I'm glad I wasn't alone. And for the record, I didn't not like you. Well, I didn't... not like you either. And I still don't not like you. So we both don't not-like each other. Does that mean that we like each other? Ooh! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Megan? No, it's me... Your other daughter. Oh. Where've you been? Uh, with Adam. Kind of late for a school night. Is Megan still out with her friends? Isn't this past her curfew? Ah, whatever. Now she's got, like, friends. And I never had to enforce a curfew... And now she wants to do things, and it's just insanely cool. Sounds like "Cool Girl" just got home. Come on! Okay. Freddy gave her a ride home. They've been spending a lot of time together at rehearsal. Ooh. I bet he kisses her goodnight. - No way. - Five bucks? You're on. Oh! - Come on! - Not the awkward front-seat hug. - Awkward front-seat hug! - Aww. Just great. Come on, Freddy. Pull it together! Oh... ahem. Ahem. Hey, Mom... Aunt Darcy. Oh, hi! We didn't realize you were home! Oh! How was your ride home with the cute boy... Not that I saw you were with a cute boy. I didn't... Mom. It's Freddy. We were just working on our carol arrangement. Can we show that to the group next week? Of course! Is this carol a solo or a duet? Goodnight, Mom. You guys got, like, a Danny-and-Sandy vibe going? I don't know what you're referencing. Kids today don't know the classics... They don't know, they don't know. You owe me $5. Okay. Can't even wait till tomorrow. - Yeah. - Front-seat hug. Hey! So, um... so Megan told me that she and some of the others were working on a new arrangement. I know it's kinda late to learn something new, but I told her that she could teach the others today. Is that okay? Yes. Absolutely. Oh, I got to take this. I'll be right back. Uh, everyone... Hello? Darcy? Jon Arnett, Cypress Records. I heard your demo... The new stuff? I got to say, I-it's... it's great. You know, I remember you from the "Sugar Rush" days, of course, but, uh, this new sound, I... I love it! You were a star then, still a star now. Maybe people just don't realize it yet. Oh, thank you very much. It's very kind of you to say. This is usually the part where you say "but" and break my heart. The CEO does like to see his artists in person before he makes a final decision, so I am gonna see to it personally that I get you in the room with him, because I know exactly what to do with you, how to sell your records. Do you have three new songs ready to perform live? Uh, y-yeah. I would sing a dozen, if it helps me get signed. I love it. You got the hunger. Just like me. Listen. Make sure you're ready... 'cause you're gonna have a shot to join the Cypress family. Thank you, Jon! Thank you... so much. Merry Christmas! Thank you. Merry Christmas, Darcy. Ahem. Learn that for tomorrow. This is for the third song. All right, they're ready. Oh, great. Okay So, remember, no matter what... Positive energy. Yes, nothing but positivity and encouragement, a-and they'll get better with time and practice. ♪ La, la, la ♪ La-la-la-la-la-la... ♪ La-la-la-la-la-la ♪ Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh ♪ ♪ Hee, hee, hee hee, hee, hee ♪ ♪ Christmas-time is the very best time ♪ ♪ To take my baby dancing ♪ La! ♪ Sing along now as the church bells ring ♪ ♪ Ding-dong-sing-along-whoo ♪ The kids around the mistletoe ♪ ♪ Covered by the amber glow ♪ Underneath the sugarplum sky ♪ ♪ Sing along now as the church bells ring ♪ ♪ Ding-dong-sing-along-whoo ♪ We all need somebody to hold ♪ ♪ 'Cause the streets outside are frightfully cold ♪ ♪ Christmas-time is a wonderful time ♪ ♪ Ding-dong-sing-along-whoo ♪ Ding-dong-sing-along Ding-dong-sing-along ♪ ♪ Ding-dong-sing-along-whoo ♪ I've got my partner by my side ♪ ♪ Singing songs of yuletide ♪ With the snow falling down around us ♪ ♪ Sing along now... Okay, okay, everyone, go enjoy your first night of holiday break. You have earned it. I am so proud of you... And I will see you at the next rehearsal. - Whoo! Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! Great job. Oh. Hey! Who's that? Oh, that's Rick. The football coach. You ask her yet? Shh! I told him to come say hi. I think he's shy. He's shy? He looks like he could bench-press a bus. You know, I've known Adam a long time. He's never been this relaxed this close to competition. And that includes when he was a student, mind you. Well, we have a great group of kids. I'm not talking about the kids. You've had this impact on him. Oh, I'm sure he's just grateful for the help. We've had other teachers try to help him in the past. They always want to strangle him by day two. I've had that fantasy a few times myself. You keep up the good work. - Thank you. - Looking forward to the show. Yeah! That might be the best week of rehearsal they've ever had. They were in the zone! You look happy. I am happy! Strange. All right, well, I should be going. Gretchen is making meatloaf tonight. That sounds... delicious? Oh, no, she should be arrested for serving it... Assault with a deadly weapon. Ouch. Well, um, have a good weekend and I'll see you Monday? Um... what would you think about us, you know, getting together this weekend? Like, for a rehearsal? I was thinking... for a date. I... would be... amenable to that. How does Saturday sound? Oh, what did you have in mind? I thought we could go into town, and then maybe head over to Jensen's. Jensen's? All right. I will pick you up at seven. And, uh, try not to let the meatloaf kill you. Our date will be far less fun if you're dead. Okay. Okay, see ya then. Your cheeks are bright-red. They are? Okay, this is stupid. Why am I bothering? I'm gonna be wearing a hat. Why are you wearing a hat? It's 35 degrees outside! My ears are gonna turn to ice cubes. Oh, my gosh. You'll be inside for most of the time. Your ears will survive. Are you sure it's all right? I feel bad not spending the night with you and Megan. Of course. We're just gonna be watching Home Alone... I love Home Alone! Drinking cocoa. I love cocoa! We're gonna eat leftover meatloaf. This is where you say, "I love your famous meatloaf!" I love your famous meatloaf. Thank you for lying. You're welcome. Oh, should I change? I don't like what I'm wearing, all of a sudden. Oh, my gosh, woman. Two weeks ago, all you could do is complain about the guy, and now you have jitters like it's prom night. I don't have jitters! I'm shivering. It's cold in here. He's not who I thought he was. He's actually... nice. And good with the kids. And dorky, but in a weirdly attractive way. When I'm with Adam, just hanging out with him... it just feels good. Oh, my gosh. I have not seen you this ga-ga over a guy since Eddie Cronauer in eighth grade. I am not ga-ga! And please, nobody compares with Eddie Cronauer. Oh, what a hunk! - He was so dreamy. - Oh, so cute. Every class has one. You look beautiful. You would even stop Eddie Cronauer dead in his tracks. Do you mean that? Because that is an incredible compliment. Yes, I do. Oh! Ahh! Hey! You're Darcy's sister. Gretchen. Hello. I like your hair. Oh, I like your... everything. That was a weird thing to say. I'm sorry. You have her back by curfew, okay? Yes, ma'am. - Okay, bye. - Okay! Bye-ee! There you go. Good fan? Oh, great fan. She said "I love your work." Not "I loved your work," not "you were my favorite." "Love." Oh, gosh. A present-tense verb from a fan is a real gift. That must happen all the time... Fans coming up, singing your praises? I know it happens to me, but I am the six-time repeat champion. Are we still doing that? Okay, I'll stop. Adam, I cannot emphasize enough just how little that happens to me in New York. Well, there's not many famous celebrities in Dayton. There's the Wright Brothers... Martin Sheen, and... you. Hmm! And it's not like I want it to be like it was when I was 20. You know, I couldn't even go to the mall, but, yeah... every couple of months, a random person coming up, excited to see you? Yeah. Just someone coming up and saying, "Hey! I like your work. Keep going." We should start doing that, just to random strangers, on the street. Just random attacks of encouragement. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah, Young Me could've used that. Who am I kidding? Old Me could use that. Well, I've got news for you, Adam. I love what you're doing. Keep going. And I love your work. You should definitely keep going. Look at us. From high school rivals to adults on a date. I'd call that progress. Not rivals. Rivalry implies competition. Why is food this good hiding in Dayton? This should be on the French Riviera or, or at the top of an expensive tower in Abu Dhabi or something. Yeah, I've never been any of those places, but year. I agree. So after "Sugar Rush", I went on a world tour... You know, Paris, Buenos Aires, Rome, Seoul... honestly, all it did was make me very lonely. From 18 to 25, I-I didn't date. I was too busy. Wait. Didn't you date a Backstreet Boy? Publicity stunt. Oh... Oh, I feel betrayed. So, yeah, for those formative years, when I was single and should've been out having fun, I never learned how to date. Thank God! I never learned how to date. I was terrified that you'd be able to tell. You didn't date? I don't believe that... Look at you. Okay, first of all, flattery received and appreciated, but I just dated the same person for so long that I never had meet a woman at a bar or a party or anything like that. We... We dated in college and then through grad school, and for a little while after that. What's her name? Anastasia. Ooh, "Anastasia." Terrific ex-girlfriend name. The best! Right? But we were both just both headed in different directions, and we denied it for a while, but... we knew. So, we ended it, and it was hard, but necessary. And, after that, I just... I didn't date anyone for a while. I mean, my dating pool is not really big... It's mostly moms of students, and I'm just not really comfortable with that. But you feel comfortable dating the aunt of a student? Oh, absolutely. It's always been a dream of mine. You know, if you're here for New Year's Eve, this place does a tasting menu that's out of this world. Yeah... uh, yeah, if I'm here, absolutely. So, did I get you back in time for curfew? Ooh, by the skin of our teeth. Look at that. That's so beautiful. Um, I... Oh, I'm sorry. No! I just, um... No. I'm being, uh... I'm being presumptuous. No! No, you're not. I... It's not that I don't want what's happening here. I like you. I... really like you. "Really" is good. I like "really". But I am going back to New York after the holidays, and I'm afraid that I... I don't want to get too attached. I think you are amazing, honestly. I'm just... trying to protect myself. I hope that's... No. I... No, I know. It's completely understandable. I had the best time tonight. So have I. Well... Yeah, okay, well, goodnight, Darcy. I will see you Monday? Yeah. Goodnight, Adam. Yeah. Do I smell gingerbread? We are making houses. So, if you live in New York, shouldn't you have made, like, a teeny, tiny gingerbread apartment with little gingerbread cockroaches? Mm, that is insulting. I don't have cockroaches in my building. The rats scare them away. Ew. I'm sure Christmas in New York is magical. Yeah, I'm usually working, to be honest. Doing my Christmas show, writing to Santa for a record contract. I'm sure he'll bring you one this year. Actually, uh, Cypress Records reached out a couple of days ago. What? Aunt Darcy, that's amazing! Nothing is official. I don't want to jinx it. Every time I get close, I feel like the rug is yanked out from under me. All I want is just to be back in New York, recording music full-time again. Okay, I feel compelled in this moment to point out there are also recording studios outside of New York City. I love being here. But it's also scary. Because I don't want to be yet another former musician who leaves New York, moves home, and gives up on her dream. Okay, whether you are in Dayton or New York, you will never be a "former musician". I would not let you do that. I would pay to have you do concerts right here in the living room, if I had to. I wouldn't perform in here. The acoustics in the bathroom are so much better. Diva pop stars, am I right? The demands. I think it's time. Aw, yay! When your aunt and I were little kids, we would always put gingerbread versions of ourselves outside our of our house because... a gingerbread person... makes a gingerbread house a gingerbread home. Boop! Wait. Who's that? A Mr. Macdowell gingerbread. In case gingerbread-you gets lonely. Okay, so, Megan's mom, my sister, is going to host a big "break a leg" dinner the night before the show. Just a little last get-together before we knock 'em dead at the competition. Does everyone think they can make it? - Yes. - Yeah. Great! All right. So let's get started and we can... Everyone who's been here knows that we always do "Hark the Herald Angels Sing". It's our opener. Every year we do it, and every year it works. But this isn't every year. I want to change up our arrangement. Make it unique. Just have fun with it! And I need your input. You want to change it up? I think that we should. What do you guys think? Yeah! - Okay! Get up on your feet. - All right. - Okay? - Great! Sasha, give us one of those beats. Yeah! Yeah, just like that. Good. You ready to come in? Megan, put down the TikTok! That's not gonna stir itself. Are you ready for your last rehearsal today? No, Mom's holding me hostage. Oh, don't be so dramatic. Okay, give me the spoon. Thank goodness. Oh, I, uh, I have to take this. No. Can't it wait? Two minutes. Mashed potatoes wait for no one, Darcy! Hello? Darcy? Jon Arnett. Cypress Records. Are you ready for an early Christmas present? The CEO wants to sign you. He's bringing you in! You just have to sing a couple songs, impress the suits, and you're in! What do you think? Think you can do that? Of course, Jon. Oh, g... I-I just, I don't know what to say. Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! Please, thank you! You know how many lousy demos I have to listen to every day? I should be thanking you more! Listen, uh... our CEO likes to announce all his new artists right at the start of the year, you know? Big splash, tons of press... But our CEO has, uh, his holiday trip for the Maldives, and he's leaving tomorrow night, so he'd love to see you tomorrow, around lunch if possible, you know, so we can hit the ground running as soon as he gets back. This is in New York? Yeah, Upper West Side. You should see this guy's office. It's... It's unreal. Yeah, the thing is, um, I'm not in town at the moment, so it might be tough for me to get back. Where are you? Uh, in Dayton, with my sister and my niece. We have Christmas plans, and... Okay, okay, hey, no problem. Listen, uh, how about we, uh, we fly you in tonight or first thing tomorrow morning, we'll see you in the afternoon... And have you back in Ohio for Christmas Eve? Yeah, uh, yeah, that's, uh... that's a thought. Um, it's just... my niece has this show tomorrow evening and... It's bad timing. I get it. Uh... and I can't imagine how much time you've had to spend away from your family and friends over the years, but, if you make this flight... and you sing for him this one time, we're gonna get you everything you ever wanted! I'm so sorry, Gretchen. What can I say to make this better? I don't know, Darcy. You've put me in this impossible position. If I tell you not to go, it's like I'm telling you not to take the thing that you've been fighting for, and I can't do that. And I will come right back. I'm gonna miss the concert, which stinks, but I'll be back for Christmas morning, I think. Darcy... Darcy. It has been so great having you here... Not one-foot-out-the-door here, but really here-here. And look at all the good things that you've done in the last two weeks! Megan is like a whole brand-new person. And all those kids, and Adam, and me. When, in the last two weeks, have you walked into a room and found me crying? Never. That's progress! And that's thanks to you. Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like if you stayed here. I wonder the same thing. Well, if you're gonna stand around and silently debate your internal conflict, you might as well help me chop some chives while you're doing it. Come on. Pass me that garlic. Here you go. Why is the football coach here? That's Freddy's dad. What? - Yeah. - Hey! I haven't had a chance to introduce myself. I'm Frederick Senior. Folks around here call me Rick. Hi. I've got to tell you... I love your music. Oh, let me guess... "Sugar Rush"? Well, I was gonna say your last album, four years ago. It's an absolute touchdown. I've never heard a more thoughtful meditation on what it means to be a contemporary woman in today's society. Thank you, Rick! Oh, I should be thanking you. For helping my son the way you have, and my buddy, Adam, here... Oh! Yeah... - Okay. - There it is. - Yep. - Yep. I'm starving! Is everyone ready to eat? "Herald Angels!" Can I get you anything else? Oh, no, I'm good, thanks. Hey. I know that you're worried, but don't worry... Tomorrow's gonna go great. No, it's not that, it's... uh... Uh, just excuse me. One minute. I just... Um... if I could just get everyone's attention for a minute, um, I have a bit of an announcement to make. Um, I was gonna wait until after the meal, but I-I don't think I should wait that long. So I got word this morning that I have the opportunity to sign with a major record label. - Oh! - What? Thank you. Thanks. Um... but, unfortunately, it's a bit of a good news/bad news situation. Because, in order to sign with this label, I need to perform for them in person. Tomorrow. I... I... I need you guys to know how proud I am of every single one of you. You guys united the groups. You united us. You inspire me. Truly. I never thought that I would be singing in New York, but wishing I was hanging out with high school kids in Dayton. Please, please know, that I am going to get tons of videos from Megan's mom... Dozens and dozens of videos, all the videos. I don't have enough storage space for all the videos that she's gonna send me. I am so, so sorry. I feel like I'm letting you down. No. Aw. - Hey. - Hey. Everyone go home? People were wondering where you went. They get to see me every day. It's your night. I didn't want to get in the way. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. No. It's... It's okay. I'm excited for you. Really. I just thought that we had a couple more days. That's all. Do you need a ride to the airport tomorrow? Oh, my flight is early morning. I wouldn't ask that of you. Darcy... you can ask of me anything you want. I know that your life is about to change... again, in a really big way... and when you're traveling around the world... again... to Paris, Buenos Aires, Rome... if you get lonely, like you did before? I'm just a phone call away. I know. Well, that's it. Exactly. Yeah, I think if we just... uh... Can hold on a moment? - Is she here? - Yes. Great! Send her in. Hey, I'm gonna have to get back to you. No problem. All right. Fantastic. Merry Christmas. Darcy! Come in! Hi there. Oh, so great to finally meet you. It's nice to meet you, too. Ahh. How was the flight? Everything good? Uh, yeah. Yeah. The plane was delayed at the gate, so I came right here. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You must be thirsty. - Let me get you some water. - Yeah, that would be great. - Is that all right? - Yeah. And, uh, if there is anywhere that I can... I'm so sorry. Anywhere you can...?

I heard her talking about you. What'd she say? - Well, she said... - Herald Angels! On deck. Let's hear it one more time for Rebels Without a Claus from Stanton High! Surprise. - What? - Shh! You're here! What happened? Oh, the label loved me. They wanted me to stay and meet some more people, but I told them no. I told them that I could not miss my niece's Christmas concert. Darcy, your career... This is Christmas with the people that I love and I realize that while it would be amazing to sign with a label again, it's just not enough anymore, and so I told him that, while I know I could be spending a lot of time on the road, I'm gonna be making Dayton my home again. And I am never going to miss a Christmas with you and Megan ever again. Well, what did they say? They supported my decision. Oh, and they signed me! Oh, yeah, of course. Obviously. Have you heard me sing? I'm amazing. Ooh! Oh, it's pretty hard to sing with broken ribs. Oh! Ribs are overrated! Oh, okay, I am actually... I'm gonna go backstage and go say hi to the kids.
