Here. There? Everything is timed and ready down to the last detail. - Brilliant, Sickan. - But of course! But where do they keep their earnings? In a secured vault. It just so happens that IKEA is impossible to rob. How were you thinking we'd do this, then? Here's how: Several times a day, each cashier at IKEA takes out their cash registry box. The cashiers go with their boxes to the registry office on the second floor. Every box gets a personal signature, and the money is put in special plastic capsules. These capsules are put into a pipe with great suction... ... And get pulled through a pipe complex spanning all of IKEA. If the complex is breached at any point, the suction stops immediately, and an alarm sounds. This pipe ends at a special vault. Design by: Franz Jäger. Once a day, this vault is emptied... They empty it once a day? ... However, not during certain weekends; those weeks, the vault only gets emptied Sunday evening. By then it may contain around 8 million Swedish crowns in bills... ... And this is one of those weekends. THE JÖNSSONGANG Resurfaces - Beautiful... - M-hm, we're done! Come up! Come up. Harry! Get a move on, c'mon! - Is the vault at the top? - Shh, calm down! - Get a move on, Harry, dammit. - Here?! - Quiet! - Quick, Harry... Move it! - Is this really the place? - Now go down! Yeah... Of course, Sickan. - And now you go down. - No way! Just go down! - Scram! - Welp, suit yourself, then. Hey, stop right there! Stop! The box! Oh goddamn it, Harry! Get moving! - Hey, guys... - Just keep moving! That... Is where we make the incision. The hose. And the box. Nohoho... It won't open! Cool it. I'll handle this, Sickan. - "Charles-Ingvar"! - Yeah, that's right. - Ugh! - I'm just a little tired. - Where? - There! [You may only use mode 6.3 for the CENTRAL VACUUM CLEANER] Yeah, if that falls out, we're done for. - Marking tape. - Comin' right up. Woah! Oh, how sweet... That's love! The saw. Hello? The spray. Ready? Ready. Oh, whoops... The other saw. Good, keep filling it up. So cold... Swap. Now. Take that. - Here. - Careful! The hose. Further back. 1... 2... 3! Brilliant, Sickan! But of course... - Crowbar. - Eyup! Hurry up, hurry. Further down? The pincer. The hell? Brilliant, Sickan. - The sack! - Sack? The sack for the money! Thought you'd cram it into your hat? - The sack for the money. - Sack? Oh come on, where is the sack?! Gimme a sec. Here, this'll... Hey, here. - Take the capsule. - Stuff'em up! Brilliant, Sickan. Come on... Get a move on. Can I have a look? Sure, please do! Oof, I think I've got a fever. - So that's 8 millions... - C'mon, move it! Cleared. Hey, watch out... Harry, your sca-! Ngh... Get out! Get out!! - What, that's the one? - Apparently so! No...! This is Criminal Inspector Persson; I'll take over, guys! Where the hell'd he go, huh? There it is! - Where's the box? - There! Let's get out of here. Oh, so Sickan hasn't shown up yet? He may be short, but you can still see'im. Unless he's shrunk, that is! He didn't go with you, then? He was dawdling. And you didn't have the time to wait? Uh, no. - He bolted. - Where to? - We thought he was here! - He sure ain't, though... He's tricked you. Obviously! What a bastard! What... Y'think Sickan would rip us off? His comrades! You've got the key. Go open it. - Evidence! - We'll have to identify the owner, though. No need! "No need"? It's written here! - Is it? - Mhm! Paul U. Bergström! - That's perfect... - All the way from Belgium. Dude, take the box. Hey boss, it's me. Yep, we've been at IKEA and picked the equipment up. Uh-huh... 's all where it should be. Yup... 's all done. And we were gonna leave... Hold up, Boss. Check the shipping list! Yup, it's all done. We'll, uh, stick to the plan. 'aight! [DAMAGED] Ugh... Oh, that's bold... Dammit! Then what do they want? They must have gotten in this way. - Uh-huh... Wait, "they"? - There must have been two of them. - Three, actually! - Is that so? - Say, could you tell us what they looked like? - Gren! Open the box! Yeah... That guy's done a lot of dumb stuff, for sure. Oh, he certainly has! Yes. There we sat, waiting and waiting... He just left, that little sump rat. Unreliable guy, huh? Yes, and unfriendly! Do you miss him, then? Nah... We're done with the guy, right Harry? Yes, you only get to fool me once! Actually, lemme tell you something: Sickan's over. Sickan's over. Sickan's over.. Sickan's over... Sickan's over... There?! Charles-Ingvar! Oh, hi Sickan! Speak of the devil! We were asking ourselves when the genius was gonna show. Ain't that right, Harry? Yes! That's what we were saying. Isn't that right, Doris? What've you done with your trousers? I'll fix them in a jiffy. I have a plan. Hey, Sickan has a plan! A plan? Double-sided tape... Did you hear that, darling? He has a plan! Does he, now? How much revenue this time? Or is this another "floor plan" of yours? Can't anyone get this blasted woman to shut up? We're taping! Oh, stand still, Sickan! This'll go great, just you wait. - Get her out of here. - Marvellous, isn't she? Now it's done! Fab, right? I have a plan... Hey Harry, I think we should go to the upper regions for a bit. Oi! H-hold up, boys! The place has gotten some 'ovations since last time! - So, Doris... - I've got it! Fire in the hole! Hup! Contact with the holy Father; trip your way on up, guys! - Step it up, Ragnar! - "Step", huh... - That's so fun! - Oh, Doris! You're so... You are so...! Harry, get a move on! ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! - I'm coming! - Oh, Harry... What the hell was that? There! Now that the stairs are up we can talk! I have... A plan. - It says "Shipping list", what's with that? - That's the plan. A brilliant, fantastic plan... Perhaps the most interesting plan we have ever come to grips with. Purely by coincidence... Or perhaps I should say, due to a mistake involving our scarf... Our paths have crossed with an international operation. This could possibly mean a life-long holiday for all of us. That calls for a little refreshment! Uh... W-would you like this, Sickan? - No thanks. - No? ... Ragnar? Sure... Eyup! Let's say this is America... Here we have Belgium. This is Sweden. And here we have Russia. There is a company in America which exports top secret electrical equipment to... Belgium. In Belgium, they repack the equipment and place it in boxes with the label: "Damaged furniture, to return. IKEA." After that, it gets sent to... Sweden. To be precise: The IKEA in Stockholm. Two inside men are working at the store. They pick up the equipment and pass it on to the Swedish middle man... ... Who illegally sells the equipment to Russia. ... Who illegally sells the equipment to- ! Who illegally... Sells the equipment... To Russia! For a gargantuan amount of money. Hold up, Sickan... Who's that Swedish middle man? Who do you think? As a representative of the economic industry, I am incredibly pleased... ... to invest in Swedish sports. After all, the industry and sports have quite a few things in common! To be precise: morals and a love for one's home country. Together, we make... Team "Future"! And as for the economical details... Three million over two years. An investment which we hope will result in victory for Sweden! - Feel free, gentlemen! - Thank you. Alright! Well then, the personnel has set the table. Please go ahead! We can offer you coffee and a few other drinks, such as juice... There it is... Wall-Enberg's empire. He controls the entire property. This includes the Chinese restaurant on the bottom floor... Right, that's where he launders cash from the gambler's den, y'know, the one on the floor above if I've got it right. Exactly. And the member cards? Professionally made counterfeits, Sickan, of course. On the same floor as the gambling den, we have Wall-Enberg's private little room... With a speed dial going straight to the top, to a fortified room. This room is hermetically sealed, with the only entrance being a 4 decimetre thick armoured door. The only window has been sealed by bricks... And the equipment is guarded 24 hours a day by two people. - "The Beef"! - Yes: him and a very unfriendly, specially imported guerilla. Yikes! Hold on... Then how will we get the equipment out of there? It's impossible! Through the food elevator... And Doris. Doris?! Well, she... Certainly has a couple advantages. What a wonderful human being she is! Like all great men, Wall-Enberg also has a great weakness. - Money! - Cool cars, yeah? ... He has an Achilles' heel. He pays great attention to décolletage... Perhaps far too great... Follow me! Oh my god, it was him! You know, the one on TV! - Yeah, that's how it goes. - But-! No more? Number 13? Wow, what an atmosphere! Never seen anything quite like this! You've sure had plenty of ideas tonight! First a fab restaurant and now this; what's all this? Just an old gambling den, y'know. Oh, Harry'd like to hear about... Actually, where is he? Wasn't he supposed to be here by now? He's on his way. - Welcome. - Oh, are you the man himself? - Indeed, CEO Wall-Enberg. - Good day to you, sir! I have to say, the atmosphere's great in here! So many interesting people! May I offer you a drink? Thanks, I'd like many- woah, that was fast! Why, this is my kind of place! Well, m-maybe I'll go check if the ball's got any spin. Cheers! Welcome! G'day! I come from the Health Inspection... I see, you ordered a table? Yes... N-no, actually, a client saw a rat in here... As in, a rodent. - Here? - Yes, there... - Here! - In there? Let's eat something really good tonight, while things are calm. ... Sorry, I just can't get IKEA out of my head. Oh, take it easy! It's a slow night, so try not to get too riled up. - I'll foot the bill! - Oh, really? Thanks a lot! May I tempt you with a glass of Roche? A brut from '58. A brut? Yes, the world's best champagne. Oh, that! I could imagine a lot of that! Wow, this is the life... Are you here often? What, do you store your champagne in the heater or something? 16! I must be dreaming... What are you doing?! What are you doing, Sir?! What do you mean? You've stolen my chips, Sir! Look, I just had my hands full! What kinda person are ya, Sir? - Lookit this guy, a thief! Right? - I haven't stolen any chips. There I am, standing around playing a lil' by the rules and then you're groping around... - There are some unsavoury people in here... ... And checking my chips out; then suddenly I don't have any chips left! - What do you mean? - Man, what kind of man are you?! - Lookit this guy, a thief! A thieeef! - I haven't taken any chips! [1-2: CHINA WEE, 3-4: WE INVEST, 5: OFFICE WE, 6: WE PRIVATE, 8: FORTIFIED ROOM] 's the boss... Yeah? Bring down the equipment immediately. Want Manfred to bring it? Use the food lift. He wants us to send down the equipment... Using the food lift! Now then, what's behind this hatch? - Just the food lift. - Food lift? Yikes, that's... The rats love to hang out and party in places like that! - Do they? - Yes, here... What's that smell? Ah, it tastes spring rolls! Pardon? Spring. Rolls! - ... I think I'd like one. - Right, good, then I'll... Look, I'll come back, this won't go unpunished!! - You'll regret this! - Terribly sorry this happened. Yes, I'm shocked, I'm distraught, I've never seen anything like that actually. - Brut. - Excuse me? Yes, brut, my throat feels very dry. - Yes, naturally! - Naturally not! You don't want to get drunk, right sweetie? - Yes I do! - Oh... We could share a bottle out here, that's all I'm saying! He keeps the champagne in there! - Would you let me try some of this "brute" as well before we- - If you insist. This way, please... Be careful with that box! Equipment's on its way down now. It should not be going down! Understood? ... Dazzling. Amelin. Dazzlin' Amelin. So much yapping about that damn thing... It's supposed to get up again! Oh, there it is... Now there's another problem? Hello... Your spring rolls... Sorry, could I have some rice grains with that? Rice, Chinese-style? Alright. The hell? It's going down again! Whoopsie! Should the equipment be going up or down? Down! Down... The painting should be further down the wall, that'd look better... Boss! Is it down? It is not down, and it should go up! Down! It suits better further down! Right, now it's up again... Like a fucking yoyo! Oh, that's one twitchy rascal... Let's bring that rubbish DOWN! Wohohohoah! Look at this, everyone! Nothing here, nothing there! - Oh, boy... - "Soy"? Er, yes... Soy! Quickly, soy sauce! Harry. What? Harry, the top. We don't have much time! So, little Doris, what's your job? I am, er... Within the public sector. - Yes, I can see that. - No way, how could you tell? ... Anyway... It was a good investment. Oh, so it's surrounded by real silver? - No, that's the frame. - Exactly? Ohhh dear. Look, the police. Welp, it's about time we leave. - You're right... - Am I? Some unwanted guests are about to arrive... Huh, they are? Wait. I mean, I was just joking. Uh... Is the police here?! What did you do? They've sent a guy over, right? Seems like big stuff is going down here. I doubt it. Try some of this duck, it tastes incredible. Those little ginger crumbs along the top really pack a punch. This might be related to IKEA, though?! Oh, please, take a break! Let's not think about policework and focus on the oriental kitchen instead. What a duck! Heh, I really am hungry. Yummy! My sincere apologies, but it appears we need to leave this locale. Oh, do we? Well, thanks a billion for the hospitality! Come on, Doris. - What- - Doris, come on! Yes, but... Whatever! Thanks! Move the equipment! You might hit it! Boss, I think someone's in the attic! - We gotta leave, Doris. - Now? We're surrounded. Hide the equipment! What's going on, then? The lab wants you to get in touch with them. Oh my God, we're in the middle of eating fried pineapple with ice cream! What's going on? - Is it IKEA? - Probably. Oh, well... We'll get to it. Oh dear, I'm feeling a bit... I'll have to... Go on, then. God, I'm full. Hey! You know where the toilets are? Hey!! - Where are the toilets? - They're this way. Sickan! The spring roll was not good! Ah!! The bag! Thanks... Guess we're off, then! Now that IKEA's moving forward... God, there's never any peace and quiet... Look, the cook's utterly finished! They sure give the customers their all here. Head waiter? Check please. Who'd have thunk it'd work? This little... This little, to use Doris' charming expression for it, little 'toy'... - Could, when handled with care, be worth about- - 240 millions, Sickan! - Yup! Half of it for them, and half for us! What do you say about that? - Diamonds and chrystals, I say! - What are you talking about? Oh, I'm talking about style and finesse... And your furniture. Oh, my furniture? What about it? - You think PG would like to sit in these things? - Pee-Gee? Gyllenhammar, and all the other top of the pops that'll be hanging out here! - Chevalier to you, and- - Eh-hem. Dear... Coworkers... This is... A really... Big day... For the Jönsson Gang... This is... Without a doubt, as Doris said earlier... ... This is the start of a new life. ... Yes, now we are the ones in possession of the little... 'toy'. Now we are the ones to dictate the terms for the upper reaches of society! Cheers! - Cheers... - Brilliant, Sickan. Hey! - Did you bring the receipt? - Why? You footed the bill! Yes, but now this is a business expense. Hiya, Hasse! You gotten anything? Oh, right. All the results are here. We've gotten some real good fingerprints. - From IKEA! - No, it's from a... Charles-Ingvar Jönsson. - Yeah, that's it. - Wait, how could you tell? Experience, workforce skills, and knowing how to read. - The car. - No, it's locked. - Go to the car. - Wuh- alright. Oh! Somebody's at the door! I bet it's a telegram from Anders Wall! The cops! Get the ladder! Nobody was there! - Now what? - I don't know. Fire in the hole! Oh, there you are! Talk about taking a longcut! Anyways, here I am! - We're terribly sorry for coming here this late- - Oh, no problem, we're in the middle of celebrating! I see! Celebrating what? - We're looking for a man called Charles-Ingvar Jönsson- - Oh, that's Sickan! Well, you see, um... Hold on, what's the matter? - IKEA. - I see, so you're within the same trade? - Are we? - Yes, business! But if that's the case, you shouldn't talk with Charles-Ingvar. He doesn't know a thing about those things. Go talk with Harry, my husband. A real bright bulb, he is! - What range are we talking? - Eight million! What, not more?! Then you should talk with Sickan. After all, my Harry is on a much higher level! - In that case, apologies for wasting your time. - Oh, no problem at all! - But if Harry were to show up- - Down. I show up but he just has show-downs, it's a family joke! - Once again, we are sorry. - Don't be! And 8 million is at least a start, as Harry and I sometimes say! Au revoir! [Stock reports] Good swing! Ah, so you play golf as well, Mr. Jönsson? But of course. It's not quite sailing season yet, after all! Isn't that right? Where are they? - There. - Where's that? - Now he's gonna swing, y'know. It's all going smoothly, Harry! - Uh-huh... [Stock reports, continued] [Stock reports glitch out and eventually stop] Plenty of pine cones this year! Right on the green, actually! What a freaking bang! "Haderajan, had-" O- oww... Look, Harry, I was lucky enough to find the ball! It'll all work out! Seems like he thought I was a hole. "Head in one," y'know! Now hurry up. - You hurt? - Y-yeah, it's aching. Well, there's my ball... But there's no trace of yours, Jönsson! Talk about a backspin! Right, to me it looks like we're the same distance from the hole. Agreed? Or should we bet about it? How much? - 120 million crowns. - Hmm. Mr. Jönsson, I don't believe you are worth that much. No, I'm not! But the secret electrical equipment is. What are you talking about? I am talking about the "secret" electrical equipment that until recently was at Strandvägen, in a hidden room... ... But which is currently located... In an entirely different place. You're bluffing. Oh, am I? [Vanheden calculating numbers under his breath] - It's brilliant, y'know. Brilliant... - Yes! - Harry? - Mgh! It- it's just for Sickan... Would you mind putting some tanning lotion on my back? This one's not bad! Yeah, so this'll be somewhere 'round 120 mil, you know! Hey Doris, where'd you say you were goin' again? - Hawaii~! - Hawaii, y'know... ... Guess we've gotta convert that to dollars as well, then. That's about... Yeah, you've reached the mobile sector? What's going on? Charles-Ingvar Jönsson? Yeah, I'll check if the doctor's done with his operation here. Is this about the kidneys? Hey, knock it off. Yeah, just a sec. Hello? This evening. 8 o'clock sharp. - That's brilliant, Sickan! - But of course! - We need to celebrate this! - Nu-uh, my little pig~! You see, we've got Harry's drink here! Why don't we just get them? You think he's crammed 8 million into that thermos? - No, but he's got a fu- - Enough. I know Jönsson and how he does things. We'll just have to lay low, very low. - This is how they dance on Hawaii! - He'll lead us to those millions, then we catch him red-handed. - Uh-huh... I get it. - I don't think you do. Welcome! Charming. - Go on, have a seat! - Thank you! - Right, let us skip the pleasantries. - Of course... The money. - Exactly. - That's a given. And the little... Delivery? - Say, do you happen to have a spare Havana? - Indeed! Ah, it's double-barreled? Nice lighter. Mhm, it was a lucky find. Well, I assume that the untrustworthiness is mutual... So I have taken some precautions. Our little electrical toy is currently located in a car somewhere in town. My coworkers are in this car as well, and they are waiting for a call from me. Do you happen to have a telephone? Telephone! Mobile sector here. Sickan! Yeah, of course! You counted all 120 of'em? That... That's brilliant, Sickan! We'll get there soon, y'know! And, how was the banana? - Cheers! - Cheers. Look! There's the genius. Smackdab in the middle, y'know. As he should be. Hey Harry, he's waving. Wave back at'im! And would you look at that! The underling's coming with the gold! - Hey, get the stuff ready. - Alright! Open. OK. Thanks! - Heck... - Hey, look at how happy he is. - And this is- - No no no, wait a little! Oh, he's stopped waving. And now they're leaving, y'know. ... But he's still sitting there? Let's sneak. Aren't you happy, Sickan? - He's totally gone! - He's drunk, lucky him! What, Sickan, you're drinking champ in the middle of the day? - That's no good, c'mon! - The keys? Hey, Sickan! Get yourself together! You shouldn't be sleeping here. You can do that on Hawaii, y'know! - With your bag full of- - Cork! - ... Cork? - CORK?! I have been tricked... They have tricked Charles-Ingvar Jönsson! They have made a fool of me, treated me like a twit! They have bled me dry down to the bone!! Wall-Enberg will pay a steep price for this... I will have my revenge! ... There it is! - What? - The shipping list with your plan? - "MOD 8 1800, MIO 281..." - No, in the mirror. - "W-10 S-81"? - That's right... Longitude and latitude. Degrees. - Yeah, and a bunch of dots and lines, too. - No! Three short ones, four long ones. - W? - Like in Wall-Enberg! - And OD 8? - On day 8 of the month? - At 18:00. - Six o'clock, sharp. - That's tomorrow! - Exactly. - I have a plan. - That's brilliant, Sickan. Brilliant... Harry's bag... Diving goggles, snorkel, black diving suits, flashlight... Tarp... Drainpipe... - Self-inflating rubber boat... - It's right here, you know! Hey, we're gonna have to put that in the back seat. Walk around it this way. And here I am! I brought some of the stuff~! - Where's the rope? - In this cap! ... No, in the bag, obviously! And you could use the drainpipe if it starts raining! - Goodbye! - See you! Mwah, mwah... See you on the seven seas, Harry! - What's that plug? - No, that's-! - What the... What's this? Seriously, what-? - Should we corner them? - No, lay low, really low. They're slippery, like eels... God, now I'm hungry. Where's the meet-up spot? There, on the other side of that cape. There! - You found it? - Of course! It's to the north of... Ugh! Of an isolated cape. - The meet-up spot? - No, not at all! And it's totally safe? It's an old longboat-bridge. Nobody's used it in many years. Coffee first, then we're going. And what about the meet-up spot? I'm telling you, it's on the other side! - "Other side"? - Obviously! Everything's timed and prepared, down to the last detail. - Sickan!! - Hm? The police! T-there. They seem to be headed our way! Oh, that's funny... So they're planning to crack down on Wall-Enberg? But then it all falls apart! Nothing will fall apart. Vanheden! - Empty... - Then where are they? Out in the woods, digging up IKEA-millions... Hey, we'll catch them red-handed. Follow me. God, I'm hungry. - But there's a swamp here! - Then we'll walk around it! Check the light. - We should split up. - Should we?! No exaggerating. We'll keep in touch. Don't do anything before telling me first. - But how are you going to hear- - Using that!! All right, I understand. Uh, I'll start walking then! Welp, it's all coming together... ... That's what she said! Five minutes. 1, 2, 3, 4... It's correct! Give them orders to stop! Give orders to stop! Position, position, position! 3 short ones, 4 long... That's the correct signal. Give me the light. There, now that went well. - Nothing here. It's deathly quiet here. Over and out. - Sneak carefully. W-We're on the wrong side of the cape, Comrade Captain! Whatever, they gave us the right signal! But, but then what do we do? Ah, that's much better! Give the order "Frogman out"! - But-! - No buts: frogman out! Understood, Comrade Captain... Frogman out! Bring the box. Bring the box. I've found an abandoned house here... I'll check it. - Seems empty. - I've also found a house. Seems empty... Let's move on. Understood. - Хорошо. - Indeed? That's excellent. - [Russian] - Um... Yes, well... S-soon. Momento! That's good. They're on their way. Can ya really trust those redbeards? Who'd dare to trick me? - Wait, the ruble! - Nope-a, nope-a, control-a we'll... It's the same every time; why won't you trust me? Stop right there! Put the box down. Tell me your captain's name. - Capitainic? - That's right. He just so happens to be an acquaintance of mine... We should probably examine this rascal very closely! - This is the police. - What's the matter? Right, we're looking for three men that were supposed to be in the area. Ah, are they poachers? Not at all! This is about a greater international conflict. Possibly. Oh, guess I'll leave with the samples then. ... Samples? Yeah, we'll analyse the sludge and stuff 'cuz we're checking the radiation damage around here... The lab's waiting, so... Guess I'm outta here! - Oh, come on-! - Where'd he go? Anyway, I haven't seen any men. Ah, I see... Anyway, I'd appreciate if you... You know, if they were to show up... If you'd call the police center. - Of course I will! Thank you! - Thank you. Where did he go? - He disappeared! - Yes, but where to?! Here! Minuten, moments... I could tell as much myself! - He just disappeared! - Yes, but where to?! Well, I take it there weren't any shallows this time? - Я не понимаю. - I see, not in May... He must be pressing himself up beneath the bridge... This is a scandal! Where has the submarine gone? Prepare the boat! Get moving, there's not much time! Pers-... Right, drop that and hold on there, then lift... No, that won't work!! Like this! We'll- no! Vodka? Vodka, vodka... Here you go. "Helan går..." Gren? Answer me. Have you gotten lost? Yeah... I'm looking for some mushrooms and stuff. No traces of the Jönsson gang? Jönsson gang? - Is this a fucking quiz or what? - Tell me your position, Gren. Tell me your position. Get here, quickly. Why are you whispering? - They are here. - Have you seen them? Sure. Get here quickly. I'll run. Lay low. Hide in the bushes! Did that already. "... Sjung 'hopp faderallan lej'." Cheers! Prost! [incoherent] - [Russian] - [incoherent] Come on, climb aboard! Hurry up! - There it is. - They must be over there. Look there. Follow me! Cheers! Cheers for the... Jokes... COOOME!! - Be quiet! - Shut up! Just shut up... Companion! We- we- WAIT! - There, on that bridge. - What? - Get them. I'll sound the alarm. - But... All by myself?! - Banana Inc, yes. - Хорошо. - решебник. - Hey! - Get here, for fuck's sake! - Stop! - Get here, Harry! - This is the police! Let's just take this and- hurry up!! Stop! I'll shoot! Stop! I'll shoot again! We made it! God DAMN IT! - Look, they've anchored over there! - Alright! We need immediate reinforcements... This may be an invasion. Foreign submarine sighted. Tell everyone in the national security force and mine the travel ways. нихет рубель? I want the money! Now go away! You must have made a mistake! No... I handed the money over to those in the rubber boat! Get the equipment back. - Let's leave! - The ones over there got the money! There... They're the ones who tricked us! Full speed ahead! Farewell! We're going to talk about this! I'm coming over, Gren. Keep them in your sights. I'll hurry. And where are you right now?! - As quickly as possible! - Alright! This is it! Prepare yourself! - Speed up! - I'm hitting the gas here! Now we'll get them! Now! Guys, we made it! Sickan, this is the best, y'know! Faster, faster! I hope she prepped the rope ladder! Shoot, shoot! We'll get'em on the other side. Get ready... There! Where did they go? There's not a single person around! Jump in, then! They can't just have disappeared... Come on, hurry up. The bag!
