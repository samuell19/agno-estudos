NAKED... YOU DIE The driver's name is Simon. He does a bit of everything at the school. This is La Floret, our gardener. He just returned from holiday. Mr. di Brazzi is our new gym teacher. He takes over the swimming lessons. This is Richard Barrett, our riding teacher. He was in Paris, where he won a riding event. He's been at our school for two months now. He's very popular with the girls. Are you jealous? How long have you been teaching at the boarding school, Ms. Martin? Three years now. I wasn't expecting to stay so long. I was a replacement when I started, too. But Ms. Transfield made me feel so comfortable that I decided to stay. We'll be arriving shortly, Ms. Clay. The girls were already anxious when we left. They can hardly wait to meet their new teachers. Besides, they love any new change. How many are there? Six right now. Most went home or spend vacations with their parents. Since you're teaching natural history, you'll find this very interesting. The girls call it the bughouse. Inside is a collection of rare birds, butterflies and insects. To me it's kind of eerie. An entomologist built it. Now these lovely animals live in it. Sounds very interesting. Does anyone live there? No. Professor Andre, who takes care of the animals, owns a house nearby. I think that he and the entomologist are friends. Oh, look! There are our schoolgirls! Hey, kids! We've got to get going! Go where? Don't you want to welcome the new teachers? What do I care? I almost forgot. Of course you're not interested in them. We all know to whom your heart belongs. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Lucille, don't you think Betty Ann's sudden love of horses is a bit weird? Jill, stop gossiping! I don't care. Let her talk. I'm not listening. Well, why are you still here? Surely the new gym teacher is your kind of man. He's probably a 60 year old playboy. Isn't that your type? I'm sure he's young and exactly the kind of man the doctor prescribed for little Jill. A man with fire. After all, he is Italian. Who's Italian? Oh, Cynthia, you must be joking! It's all Jill's been talking about the past few days. Margaret, would you come along? I need someone to hold me back when I'm overcome with passion. Lucille, don't you want to welcome your beloved, Richard? Leave me alone, Jill. Your stupid jokes are getting on my nerves. Listen to that! Sounds like someone is in love! And she has to be interested in horses if she wants to stay close to her lover. Coming, Lucille? I'm leaving. Yes, let's go. Hey! Wait! Wait for me! Wow! He's even more beautiful than I thought. He could be the next Mr. Universe! I'll tell him I don't know how to swim, and he has to give me lessons! Then he'll touch me with those strong hands... Look! There's the new teacher! The campus is magnificent. Yes, La Floret does nice work. I'm leaving. I've got to change clothes. Okay. Please, this way. Good afternoon, Ms. Transfield. This is Ms. Clay. And this is Mr. di Brazzi. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Please come in. I think I'm in love! He's the man I've always dreamed of. That body! Unbelievable. Let's go! Come on. Give it to me. Be careful! It's very heavy. What's in the trunk, a dead body? Well, it's heavy enough. Do you think the body was mutilated? Take it to the principal's office. She's a vampire. Where's Lucille? That's none of your business. Pardon me, my lady. Excuse me, but do you have a package for sweet Jill? Ask La Floret. He picked up the mail. Yes, I did. There's a package. Simon, give it to her. It's under the front seat. Thank you. What did you get? It's a bomb! I'm going to blow up the school! Please tell me early enough so I can hide. C'mon, let's go! Ms. Transfield. Do you like your new room? Yes, it's beautiful. My little surprise worked? You're one of my best employees. That's why I like to have you nearby. This room is next to mine. Should we bring up the luggage, Ms. Transfield? No. Keep it here for now. Nice to see you again! Thank you. Our friend didn't make trouble for you? - No, he's been fine. - Good boy. Unfortunately, he's been stubborn without you around. Really? All this morning he wouldn't jump the wall. I've tried my best. If you had been next to me, it surely wouldn't have happened. We can take care of that. We just have to train harder. What about tomorrow afternoon? That's fine. And the fantastic virgin spoke, "I always have plenty of time." Did I hear a voice speaking words of jealousy? Who said this? Jealous? Me? Of who? There it is again! The jealous voice! Perhaps the owner of this voice doesn't have always time, as well? I'm not jealous. But this stupid... Ah, you're scared of horses? How silly. Horses are the gentlest creatures in the world. They inspire us and show us a world of dreams. You're crazy. Right. And what about you, my lady? I refuse to answer that. Answer or I'll have my servant whip you until you talk No, sir! I'm just a poor girl. My name is Little Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood? So... you've met the Big Bad Wolf? That's right. And who might you be? My parents call me Richard. Are you Richard the Lion-Hearted? That's me, my lady. What a great honor, sir. No, the honor is mine. May I ask you a question? Where will we meet? In the bughouse. Will you be there? A romantic place for lovers. Meet me there in one hour. I'll be there in two hours. Tell me if I'm wasting your time! Very well then, Miss Lucille. Goodbye. I'll be there. Mr. Barrett? Yes, ma'am. What is it? I would like to remind you that teachers are not allowed to schedule private lessons. Of course. Of course. Psst! Margaret, come with me! - Where? - Just come with me! - What happened? - I'll show you. Come on! What do you want to show me? It's a secret! A secret? So why show it to me? It's a secret between you and me. Daddy gave it to me. Look! What is it? What is it?! Don't you know? It's a walkie-talkie, stupid! A kind of private phone. This way we can talk over distance of 5-6 kilometers. And why did you want it? I need it for my work! You mean for your book? Yes, my book! The spy is held up in the cellar. His situation seems hopeless. The prior is no prior, but an enemy spy. My hero calls for help with his walkie-talkie. And then what happens? I don't know yet. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Let's see if it works. What am I supposed to do? Just push the button and say your name. I'll go in the garden. You stay here and wait. Okay. La Floret! La Floret! Yes? Has my suitcase arrived? Why don't you ask Ms. Martin? She takes care of the luggage. I only wanted to know if the suitcase has been picked up. Why don't you ask Simon? He was there too! - Where is it now? - In the cellar. Thank you for your gracious assistance! The girls are asking me to learn skin-diving. But I have some objections, Mr. di Brazzi. Objections to me or to skin-diving? Skin-diving, of course. I am convinced of your abilities. But we have an international reputation. Our students are from the best families. Skin-diving has become a sport of high society. I think it is awful. Besides, it is dangerous. Don't worry about that. I have plenty of experience. Well, we still need equipment. That's not necessary. I've brought along everything we need for the first lessons. Is anybody down there? Is anybody there? Who's there? Jill? Is that you? Stop joking around! Jill! Sorry, I thought it was one of Jill's jokes. No! No! No! No! Richard? Richard! Hello, Lucille. What are you doing here? I thought you were still on vacation. I wanted to see if everything is alright. Thank you. That's very kind of you. You know, I keep making the same mistake over and over again. I'm always looking forward to spending the holidays with my older sister. But once at her house we fight the whole time. And then I start to miss my little ones. You know, the animals are the joy of my old age. That's why I return earlier than planned, every year. Hey, you! Get yourself together! You've had more than enough to eat. I have to look for some worms for my darlings. Thank you for wanting to take care of the animals. Goodbye. Richard! May I ask if you are Little Red Riding Hood? You scared me. I scared you? Do I look like a murderer? You're crazy. Crazy? I'm not crazy. I'm the Big Bad Wolf! I have big ears. And I will eat Little Red Riding Hood. You can't eat me. I'm wasting my time, then? Yes, I'm sorry. Then allow me to change myself into a pure romantic. Better? Yes, much better. But I have a date with King Richard. Have you been waiting long? An eternity. He was far away. He entered a contest in Paris. Beautiful women rejoiced just for him. I'm sure he forgot Little Red Riding Hood. Then he has to be a fool. I could send him to you. But I want to earn a kiss for that. Sir, please don't make me do this. I love King Richard. How much? Very much. Have you been faithful? I can't be unfaithful. You will never look at another man? Never. However, you like me, don't you? Very much. If you'll come at 10 o'clock tonight, Richard will be there. I'll be there. I'll count every minute from now until then. I love you. Jill, what are you doing in Mr. di Brazzi's room? We missed a lesson, Ms. Transfield. Outrageous! Do you realize that you're not dressed! Mr. di Brazzi, is a very dedicated teacher, Ms. Transfield. Ms. Martin is coming. Ms. Martin, are you taking lessons, too? Good day. Sorry to disturb you. I'm looking for Betty Ann. Do you know where she is? Here I am. Betty Ann, where have you been? - Jill! - Yes, ma'am? Why do you make a fool of me? No, I said that I have seen Betty Ann. Where? On her way to La Floret. - Why? - I don't know. We'll talk about this later. Sit down. Where did you get that diving suit, Jill? From my father. Why are you wearing it? I'm preparing for Mr. di Brazzi's class. Have you seen Betty Ann? No, ma'am. I tell you, La Floret has murdered Betty Ann. That's a stupid joke. A joke? He even mistreated me. She's not dead. It's getting dark. The murderer attacks at night. No, she's at the hippodrome. She's crazy on entering a contest. I don't think so. I know someone much more involved. Right, Lucille? You're talking crazy. Peace, girls, peace. Lovers can't take jokes. Stop bugging me! Don't be so touchy. We all know that the lovely Richard-- Wendy! If you don't stop, I'll-- Lucille! Still nothing? I've searched everywhere. - Who last saw Betty Ann? - Jill. She wanted to get her suitcase. She went to see La Floret? Yes, ma'am. She was alive when she left his place. Betty Ann isn't dead! Where did you get such ideas? I'm an author. I write crime novels. You should concentrate more on your studies. Yes, ma'am. Betty Ann wanted to get her suitcase? Yes, La Floret said that it was in the cellar. Maybe he tricked her to murder her. Jill has an active imagination, but let's take a look in the cellar. Come along, Jill. The switch is broken. Don't go down there. We don't need lights. Should I come with you? No, stay here. I'll go. Betty Ann? Betty Ann? Are there spiders? Stop making jokes for once, Jill. Maybe this is just another trick. Better watch out. No, she's not down here. Did you look everywhere? She's definitely not here. Maybe she passed out, fell into the suitcase and it locked up. Don't strain your imagination. Go back to the others. Okay. - Did you find her? - No. Shouldn't we call the police? That's not necessary yet. We must avoid any scandals. Maybe she went downtown. Simon already looked there. I don't think she would break the rules. I don't think you have to worry. I don't worry. But this must not happen again! Ms. Martin, I hope next time you'll be more self-assured. Yes, Ms. Transfield. Ms. Clay, tell the girls that nobody may leave their room, and see to it personally. Ms. Transfield, shouldn't we search the park? Maybe she went for a walk, fell and broke her leg and now waits for help. That sounds quite improbable but let's have a try. I'm bored. I'm going for a walk. Ms. Martin told us to stay in our room. I'm going. Better stay here. Ms. Clay is patrolling the halls. Where've you been? Eavesdropping. I bet you thought I was with Mr. di Brazzi, but he didn't have time for private lessons. This is Cynthia Fellows' room, right? Yes. That's me. What are you doing here? We were just leaving. May I go out for a walk? Nobody may leave their room. Don't try otherwise, or I will have to report you. Denise, I'm supposed to meet Richard. - What time? - 1 0 o'clock. You'll get into trouble if they catch you. I don't care. But I don't know how to sneak out. Nobody may leave the house. Shut the door! We still don't know where Betty Ann is. They're searching for the dead body. What dead body? Betty Ann's, but they won't find it. What do you mean? Everything belongs to my book. My spy has found a place to hide after a big chase. He contacts his boss with his walkie-talkie. I offered this one to Ms. Transfield. What did she say? She said she prefers her whistle. Nothing, Ms. Transfield. I told you she wouldn't be here. Lights out at 10 o'clock. So unfair. It's not our fault Betty Ann hasn't come back. This whole thing is making me mad. They should throw her out of school. What are doing here, Denise? Go back to your room immediately. Where are you going? - To take a shower. - Scrubbing up, eh? You'll remember, right? She reminds me of somebody. Lucille? No. Ms. Clay. She reminds me of a werewolf. Thanks, Jill, but I already read this. And turn off the lights. Ms. Clay's lurking about. I'm prepared. I'm able to read in the dark. Turn out the lights. I'm worried about this girl. Aren't you? I'm certain that she'll come back. I respect your calmness. You must have a brass neck. I've a lot of experience. I didn't know that. Ms. Martin, the lights are on in the gym. Mr. di Brazzi might be in there. Someone should look into it. I'll go. Richard! What happened? Why are you running? Richard! Talk to me! What happened? Betty Ann is dead! What? She's dead! I saw her. Where? She's in the bughouse. It's dark in there. You were scared because we played Red Riding Hood and Big Bad Wolf. Please, believe me. I saw her behind the curtain. I swear it! Let's have a look then. No! I can't! There's nothing here. That's impossible. I saw her. Richard, I swear it. - You don't believe me! You think that I'm crazy! - Please, don't yell. - I'm not crazy! - Stop! Forgive me. Stop crying. You've been thinking about Betty Ann too much. You just imagined her. Richard, I'm so scared. I don't want to stay here any longer. Please take me away. Calm down. Come to your senses. Let me think-- Somebody is coming. Stay here and remain calm. Go to your room, pack your bags and be at the swimming pool at 3 o'clock, okay? Yes, Richard. I'll be there. It's you. I thought I heard screams. That's why I'm here, too. But there's nothing. So this is the famous bughouse Ms. Martin told me about. Strange. I thought I heard someone scream. I'd swear it came from in here. Maybe we're all so worried about Betty Ann... There he is. Our screamer. A toucan. I must take a better look at it during the day. Professor Andre would like that. This is his kingdom. Do you live on campus? No, I live not far away from here. Over there? Yes, at the stables. Then we can walk together. With pleasure. There is a shortcut. Stairs lead directly to the school. I didn't know that. I came from the gym on the other side. The stairs are much faster. This is where I live. Very nice. It's not as gloomy as the school. Good night. Good night, Ms. Clay. What are you doing in here so late? I wanted to take a shower. It's hot and I can't sleep. Okay, but hurry up and then go directly to your room. Yes, ma'am. Somebody in here? Help! A killer! Who's screaming? What happened? Lucille has been killed. She screamed horribly. Don't talk such nonsense, Jill. Lucille, did you just scream? Someone was at the door. - Jill! - It wasn't me. Stop doing these things! It wasn't Jill. Lucille! I hope you're not joking, too! I want no more of it! But I know that Betty Ann is dead. Stop it now! Who is in the bathroom? I'll look. Go. The rest of you go to bed now. May Denise stay here? I'm scared. Okay, but I really don't understand you. Come on. What is it, Jill? Why the long face? Cynthia is... dead. I will throw you out of school! Go to bed! Jill? What's the matter? A murder. Haven't you been waiting for such a crime? We haven't had one in this area in a long time. Let's wait and see. Wouldn't be the first time that we've come for nothing. Might be an accident or a mistake. I think it's obvious when somebody's been strangled or not. I'm sure it was La Floret. All night long he watches us taking showers. Since I found out I don't take them anymore. That's interesting. If it's true. Is it, Jill? Yes, ma'am. That may be important. Tell the police. No... No... No... No! I called the medical examiner. Good. Well, I suggest that you look around. I'll go see the principal. Okay, inspector. Who was she? Her name was Cynthia Fellows. She was British. Her family lives in Kenya. For Christmas she went home, but on holidays she stayed here. Do most of the families live in foreign countries? Yes. Jill's father is a businessman, traveling around the world. Lucille's parents died in a plane crash. She's all alone now. A cousin has been appointed as a guardian, but she hasn't seen him yet. Wendy's mother is a famous actor. She's in America now. I'd like to talk with the girl who found the body. Yes, this might be significant. I'll talk to La Floret. Thank you, Ms, uh... Call me Jill, please. Thank you, Jill. No more questions? - That's all for now. - But I'd like to help you. I'll call you if I need you. Look, I've got a walkie-talkie. Wonderful. It's a nice toy. But I have work to do. Does La Floret live in the school? No, he lives on the other side of the house. He must have noticed our arrival. Why hasn't he come? I don't know. Maybe he's asleep. He sleeps very well. I found this in a locker. It was hidden. It was hidden. Well done. Dirty. I'd like to know whose it is. Can you do this? I'll try. Go to La Floret's. I want to talk with him. Lucille! Tell me more about Lucille. Lucille... I can't. Nobody will notice it's you in my bed. Just cover your head. There's no reason to run away. Don't go crazy. I can't stay here. The murderer wants to kill me! Why do think that? Because I found Betty Ann's body. You should have told the police. Where's the body? I don't know. It disappeared. The police will think I'm crazy. Lucille, are you sure? No mistake? You don't believe me either! That's not important. But you can't just run away. I can't stand it anymore. Help me. I've to meet Richard at 3 o'clock. Why aren't you asleep? Go to your room. No, please, let her stay. Fine, but be quiet. Try to remember any detail. - Maybe it's not important, but Lucille was in the bathroom ten minutes before it happened. Are you sure? Ms. Clay saw her too. Ten minutes before... Maybe it was a mistake and Lucille was the intended victim. The question remains: what is the killer's motive? Perhaps because Lucille is to inherit a half million pounds. I want to talk to her. I'd be interested to know where she has been this evening. Look out, the inspector is looking for you. Do you ever stop kidding around? It's true! They're going to question you. Ms. Martin is coming for you now. I just wanted to warn you. Denise, what am I going to do? I don't know. But you can't run away now. Besides, do you think Richard is the one? What do you know about him? You hardly know him. I know that he loves me! Nothing else matters. Lucille. The inspector wants to talk to you. Don't worry. It's just a formality. One moment, Ms. Martin. I'll escort you. No, you don't have to. Denise will accompany me. As you like, but hurry up. If I'm still with the inspector at 3 o'clock, go to the swimming pool. No. Please, Denise! Richard will think I don't want to meet him. Why can't he wait? If the police find him, we won't be able to go away together! Denise... Okay. 3 o'clock. Yes. Come in. Are you Lucille? I'm Inspector Durant. Have a seat. Thanks. Why don't you tell me where you have been? La Floret is dead! Murdered? Yes. There's a sickle in his body. Call for more policemen. Yes, sir. Did you hear that? Another person has been killed. The second one. Don't you want to help us? Tell me before the murderer does it again! Help! Denise! Help! Denise! Where? At the swimming pool. I killed her! I killed her! Denise! Help is on the way! Inspector! Inspector! What happened? Denise was pushed into the water by a man wearing a diving suit. He ran into the park. Follow him! Where are you going? What do you want? Get your hands off me! A girl was crying. I wanted to help her. I tripped over a tree root and fell down. And where is your respirator? And the rest of your diving suit? I didn't wear the suit top. Why do you ask? And why are you wearing these pants? For fun? Yes, for working out. Yeah? Sounds very strange to me. I'm trying to lose weight. That's why I'm wearing these diving trousers. My body is covered with a plastic sheet. It's a great way to lose weight. I'm too fat. I have to pay attention to my conditioning. Walk to the brook. Look for a respirator and the suit top. Good morning. Who are you? I'm Professor Andre. What are you doing here? Me? I'm under orders to not allow anyone inside. But I have to go inside. The animals have to be fed. You better talk with Inspector Durant. I'll do just that. But first I must take a look at my collection because... No, Professor, that's impossible. Someone was murdered. Murdered? Believe me, Inspector, I'm innocent. I walked by the brook by coincidence. Suddenly someone screamed. Do you always wear these clothes when you exercise? Yes, Inspector. It's my own system. It may seem a little ridiculous, but I'm vain. That's why I'm doing it at night. You should know that my method... You can tell me later. You may go now. But don't leave campus. Of course, Inspector. Thank you. Nothing at all. Our men are searching the whole area, but have found nothing. The officers have just arrived with the search dogs. Any news? No. We have to find Lucille's cousin. He's the manager of the family estate until she's of age. But we don't know much about him. He left Paris two months ago. Bless you. How are you, Denise? Feeling better? Yes, thank you. Will Denise be questioned? Not until she's over the shock. Shock? What about me? Are you in shock too? Of course, I rescued her. And it was very brave of you. The killer is still loose. We have to find him. We? Yes! Betty Ann is still missing. You still haven't found her. Two murders and you still don't know who is the killer. We've reinforcements now. It's a matter of time before we find the killer. The dogs have found something. Excuse me, but are you Inspector Durant? Yes. My name is Professor Andre. May I speak with you? Yes, let's talk later. Excuse me-- No time now. I'm in a hurry, Professor. They won't let me care for my animals. Please go to my office and wait for me. Inspector! Over here! Hello, Lucille My animals will die of hunger. They won't let me care for them. Betty Ann is dead. Dead? Betty Ann? Who told you such nonsense? No! I saw her there. And where is she now? I don't know. The murderer tried to kill Denise at the pool. He thought she was me. A killer is looking for me! Nonsense. Professor, please help me. I can't stay here any longer. May I stay at your house? My house? Yes. No one will find me there. I would like to help but I don't know if it's right. It's ridiculous and absurd. You're having delusions. Go to your room. With the police presence, you could not be any safer. I beg your pardon. You are Professor Andre, right? - Yes. - My name is Ms. Clay. My pleasure. Is it her? Yes. It's Betty Ann. Good. Good? She was strangled. We'll find fingerprints on her neck. That's why we will find her killer. I would like to talk to the girls again. Can't you leave them alone for a little while? Lucille is hiding something. I must find out what it is. The dress we found in the locker is proof of her absence. It's a fact that the killer was trying to kill Lucille. And the attempted murder at the pool? Yes! Why did Lucille say, 'I killed her'? She was foolish. No, Ms. Transfield. She was with me. That's why someone else had to go in her place. It would have been the second confusion. The killer must be half-blind. He had on a diving mask. He was in a hurry, what with the police all around. Alright, but why kill the gardener? Because he didn't want any witnesses. - Witnesses? - He thought that someone saw him in the shower. What about Betty Ann? I still don't know. Maybe Denise and Lucille know something about the killer. Where is the inspector? He's with Ms. Transfield. They just found Betty Ann's body. We are all suspects. Especially me. It's absurd to think that one of us is the killer! The killer is a madman. I agree. But this madman could kill again at any moment. What does the inspector want from us? He needs our prints. Fingerprints? Yes. He wants to compare them with those on the victim's neck. Excuse me. Our fingerprint specialist will not arrive until 9 o'clock. Would you please come back then? It's only a formality. Is Ms. Transfield still with the inspector? Yes, they'll be back soon. He wants to talk again with Lucille and Denise. I'll look for them. Fingerprints! Are we criminals? - We've nothing to hide. Have you seen Lucille? No, ma'am. Maybe she's in the nurse's office with Denise. Should I look? Stay in your room. Get Denise dressed and bring her to the office. The Inspector wants to talk with her. Lucille's not here? No, Ms. Clay. I haven't see her either. Be quiet. It's late, and you have to go home, little bird. Be a good bird. I couldn't say no. Lucille begged me to help her. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I promised to keep it a secret. That's ridiculous. You knew that Lucille found Betty Ann's body. You knew that a killer is still on the loose. You risked your life going in her place, and you still won't talk about it! Did you find Richard? No. Nobody knows where he could be. When I'm finished here, bring in Professor Andre. Yes, Inspector. How long has Richard been at the school? I don't know exactly. Two months or so. But I'm sure he's not guilty. Two months? When will Lucille be of age? The day after tomorrow. We have to find them. Gabon, call the men. Yes, sir! Do you know where Lucille could be? Answer me! She was really confused and... And? ...and she went to find Richard. Can I help you, Miss? No. Have you seen Mr. Barrett? Yes, some minutes ago he went to the lime pit. Thank you. Lucille! Sweetheart! You frightened the horse. Are you hurt? There. You're safe now. Don't be afraid. Where were you last night? I didn't come because of everything that happened. The police never would have let us leave. I hope you didn't wait for me. No. I sent Denise. Why are you acting so strange? Oh, I see. You don't believe me. You think I was there? No! No... I thought... You thought I was the one who attacked Denise. No, that's not true. Please, you have to understand. I'm in a bad way. I'm so scared. Please, Richard. I couldn't stand being apart. You're my one and only. Please... You mean so much to me, Lucille. I love you. You are even more important to me. Lucille! Lucille! I'm coming. Who is it? What do you want? Excuse me, but Inspector Durant would like to see you at 9 o'clock in his room. Tell the Inspector that I will be there. Detective! Hurry! Look at this! Pull out the body carefully. It's Ms. Clay. I'll tell the Inspector. Where is Richard? I don't know! I don't know! I don't believe you. Why is he hiding if he's not guilty? Maybe he doesn't know that you're looking for him. Do you meet him? Where? When? No! Inspector, it would be better if... Yes? Are you sure? Where? Yes, I understand. Bring her here. I will make the necessary arrangements. Take her to her room. Ms. Clay has been found. Killed. At the lime pit. Lucille, do you know why they sent you out? Something terrible has happened. Richard? No, not him. Ms. Clay has been found dead. Will we all be killed? I can't stand it anymore, Jill! I have to go back on watch. No! Please stay! I don't have time. Is it Ms. Clay? Yes, it's her. She's been disfigured beyond recognition, but Ms. Transfield identified her by her personal affects. I'll search her room for clues. Maybe we'll find something. What are you doing here? I was told to come here at 9 o'clock. Yes, I remember. Please wait outside. Here comes Jill to save the day. Yes, we need more men. What about the fingerprint comparisons? Okay, but hurry. I need the results right away. Yes... I'll let you know. Look at this, inspector. I found it in Ms. Clay's room. In her room? It's impossible. Are you sure? Yes. I found it on top of some papers. Unbelievable. Professor! Professor Andre! Oh... Richard! Richard? Richard! Richard! He can't hear you anymore. No... it's impossible. You're dead. No. Ms. Clay is dead. I killed her first. Who are you? I'm your cousin, Pierre, my dear. Poor Richard. He made a fatal error by discovering my secret. He became another victim of mad Ms. Clay. But she cannot be judged now. Her body is in the lime pit. She admitted her guilt in a letter she left behind. She was crazy. She had to kill. She was shocked by the sight of her last victim, Lucille, laying in a pool of blood. Then, realizing what she had done, she killed herself. A perfect plan, don't you think? But why? Why did you do it? You still don't understand? It's simple. I'll explain it one more time. In two days you will turn 18 years old, and my guardianship will expire. I've been a good manager of your inheritance. But I've gotten used to your money. Do you understand now? You must die before you turn 18 years old. Richard! He's still alive! Hurry! Come to Professor Andre's! Lucille is in danger! I hope they heard me. Lucille! Richard! Richard! You left this in the principal's office. Thank you, Jill. The plan was nearly perfect. This is the confession of the killer after committing suicide. He brought the real Ms. Clay's body here so he could escape after killing Lucille This letter would have eliminated our doubts. But why did he throw the body into the lime pit before he could kill me? Otherwise the fingerprints on Betty Ann's neck would have given him away. He had to hurry. He would have killed you too had it not been for Richard. He found Pierre's case at the lime pit. And this foiled his plan. As you can see, it was I who solved the crime. When you want to officially join the force, call me. Goodbye. Good luck to you. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Goodbye, Denise. Goodbye. Jill. I'll show you out. Oh, sorry, darling. I didn't mean to hurt you. Hurt me? Your cousin made a mistake. He tried to kill me. He didn't know I'm the immortal King Richard. Darling, you're crazy. Don't talk like that. This is indignity to your majesty-- I would like to come with you. Why? Because I'm in love with you. Me? But I'm much too old for you. I'm a real bachelor. Would you really want to marry a policeman? Why not? My mother did and she never regretted it. Your father is a police officer? Well... Daddy! Daddy! New order to 009. 009 is busy. He is working on Case Jill. - Jill? - Yes. Excuse me, sir. Do you know where to put this case? You'll have to ask the principal. Should we take it inside? No, into the garage, please. This thing is heavy. Maybe there's a dead body inside.
