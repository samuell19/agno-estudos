Good morning my neighbours! Good morning Port Harcourt! Good morning my neighbours! - Good mo... - Desmond! Desmond what is wrong with you? - Are you awake? - No I'm still asleep. What kind of nonsense is this? Why are you disturbing the whole neighbourhood? I'm just happy and am greeting my neighbours because I'm happy. What kind of nonsense is that? Desmond when you you wake up in the morning the first thing you should do is go down on your kneels, thank God for making it possible for you to see another day. Not by standing at the window and shouting down this house. All right true. I have to pray it's true. Besides today is first day of my one month leave. - It's true. - That is why you should go on your knees and thank him. It's okay. Come down let's pray. - Let's pray. - You and who? Let's pray. - In the name of the father, son and holy spi... - Desmond! - You are interrupting me. God... What? - Desmond! Desmond! When you want to pray the first thing you should do is start with praise and worship. Which church is that? If I tell you I love you God, my money is your own. - Boss. Please don't do this please. - What's wrong with you? I am just washing the plates. - Boss please, let me do it, it's my job. - Cool down, I will do this don't worry just go and do what you are doing. - No boss, madam will not be happy. - I said go and sweep! - Please sir. Please sir, let me do it... - Let me just do this! Boss please. Madam will not be happy if she sees you doing this. Please. - Go and sweep! - Desmond what are you doing? - Dishes. - Is it your duty to wash the plates? - Desmond. I'm asking you. - Yes you know I have been doing it. - I just want to help her out. - What kind of stupid help is that? Don't you realize you are the man of this house? - But there's nothing wrong in doing the dishes. - There's everything wrong with doing the dishes. - That is why we got a maid. - Madam that is what I told him but he wouldn't... Will you shut up! - Oh, my husband is now your mate! - Am I your mate? Tell her. - No. - Is he your mate? Keep quiet... Infact you get out of this place. If you had done your job he would not. I don't know why I am paying you. Sweep you can not sweep, clean you cannot clean. My husband will be busy washing the plates on your behalf and cleaning the house yet I'm paying you, why am I paying you! Why am I paying you! Spending and wasting my money! My friend get out of that place! Where's this girl from? Come to tell me, am... am I your mate? - Desmond. Why do you like embrassing me? - How am I embrassing you? I'm washing and cleaning the dishes. How is that embrassment? It's... Every bit of your action is an embrassment! Why would you be washing the plates when we have somebody who is supposed to this. And can we pay her? Let me explain something to you. I don't think I am a problem the problem is you. Ever since we got this maid, morning, afternoon, night, you are angry. At night you are angry, dawn you are angry. Before we got the maid, trouble, when we got the maid trouble. - You are the problem. - Desmond. - Desmond! - That's my name. - You are my problem. - Add my surname. What stupid surname do you have? How much can your surname bring? Can you walk into any place with your surname? Do you know what name are doing out there? Hi my name is Mr. Mesan. It works. - Desmond. - Yes. My friend's husband just bought her a car, I saw it on instagram. That is what real men do. Chioma has gone abroad relocated by her husband. My own husband is still here washing plates! Should I be jubilating! - Chioma is in America. - Yes! - It's a lie. - And you are here, what do you mean by it's a lie? My friend go and drop that spoon! Sorry ma. I don't like it when I see you angry, baby just cool down okay. As long as remain poor and as long as you don't have sense! I will continue to be unhappy. Do you want me to relocate you? We can go to Ghana. - Baby let's... - You want me to go to Ghana by road. - Can you afford to pay for a flight? - Of course, how would you get to Ghana if not by road. The problem with you is that you don't know where to draw the line in your numerous lies! You get so confused that you don't even know when you tell the same lie over and over again. - I don't like it. - I am not lying I was there but I didn't see it... Just stop it! Stop it! I don't like it when people try to play on my intelligence please. You should have called me that you couldn't make it rather than... Making me go out there looking like a cheap prostitute waiting for a client. Okay, fine. I lied. Sly you are just a bastard. - Is it another woman? - No. It's business. Look baby I'm sorry okay. It won't happen again. You know our wedding anniversary is in two weeks, let me make it up to you. I was thinking we should go for a vacation with your sisters, how about that? Vacation? With my sisters. - Yea. - Seriously? - Of course. - You're not going to take back your words? - Never. - Yes! I will love it! You know I have always wanted to spend time with my sisters you know share special moments. It's more like reuniting with them. It's been a while. - Yea I know. The last time was a year ago on our wedding day. - Yes. - But I pray they don't decline. - Why don't you call them first. I'm thinking of making it like a family thing with their husbands and all. - Oh my God, it's going to be perfect. - Make the calls I will think of a resort and make the reservation, okay. - Thank you honey. - You are welcome. Anything for my sweetheart. - So go make the calls. - Yes. Honey, honestly if you know all the atrocities that girl confessed to me that she committed. - You will not call her your friend again. - Are you serious? Do you know she was a thief? A real armed robber. As in she was in a gang. - Yes. - Deliah. Yes Deliah. She confessed everything to me with confidence. Do you know she has had series of abortions from all these illicit affairs she has with her various sugar daddies. How do you think she was able to pay her way through university? But she wasn't all lucky. Do you know one of her abortions went wrong and that damaged her womb. That's the reason for her childlessness and her huband does not even know a thing. - Oh my God, poor Isaac. - Yes poor Isaac. Now she's running from one church to another seeking miracles. Not even letting the guy know that she does not have a womb anymore. She thinks God is stupid enough to give her another womb after she has destroyed the first one he gave her with her recklessness. My God poor Deliah so this is what my friend has been going through. - You need to know. - But why will she confess this to you? - You are neither a pastor nor a priest. Why you? - Perhaps she needed someone to confide in, you know. I think maybe frustrations but baby this is a secret you can't tell anybody just keep it to yourself. You trust me. It's Louisa. - Hi Louisa. - Hey sis. I'm good. - How's Abuja? - We are fine. Abuja is fine. - We give God the glory. How is Sly? - My husband is fine. - How is Melvin, how is junior? - They are all fine. - Okay sis. we are planning a vacation for us. - Really? A vacation? My God this is so splendid. Oh your wedding anniversary. The whole idea of this vacation is just for us to come together you know with our husbands - you know some form of reunion you know. - Oh my God! This is so exciting. - Yes, yes of course my husband is in town. - Well I'm going to call Becky once I am done talking to you. Oh my God... So where are you planning this vacation? Lagos? You're bringing it to me? Oh this is so exciting I can't wait. Don't forget to call sister Becky. Make sure she brings that clown husband of hers. Yes, yes, yes. Of course we're in. - Yes. Okay. I will see you around. - Okay. All right. My regards to Melvin. - Bye. - Okay bye bye. - So what hap... - Baby it's a vacation! - When, are we going? - I don't know. She's going to call me and let me know. -But we are all in -Yes. - Oh baby. - God knows I need a vacation. Oh me too. This is going to be so wonderful. Desmond, Desmond, how many... Is this right place to be shave? - Ha ha. - What is ha ha? Is it right? Why are you sitting at the dinning and shaving? - I'm sorry, I forgot and all... - Excuse me? I started in the bathroom and I ended up here, I don't know how. You don't know how? How do you think that my guests would have felt if they walked in here and saw my husband shaving? - You have guests? Which guests? Which guests? - Desmond. Sorry. Louisa. - Ha Louisa. - Is that your sister? I'm fine. How are you? It's been a while you know. How is your husband? Oh you know you married well. My darling everything is okay. He's on leave, a month leave so he's just been up and down the house all up in my face. Oh really? I know your anniversary is next week. That sounds like fun you know. Yea. Three of us. A gateaway, okay. I will inform my husband about it and I will get back to you. Bye. - But I said I wanted to talk to her. - For what, why? They're having a getaway for their anniversary and she thinks that all of us Louisa, Nadia and myself we should come with our husbands. I think it's going to be fun, a lot of fun. What's all that smile about? We are not going. Well if you say so. Wait, wait. - Why are we not going? - Isn't it obvious? - You want me to go there and embrass myself? - What do you mean embrass yourself? What do you mean embrass myself? How did I.. how can I even make that trip? All my sisters are doing better than me. They are married to good men, rich men and I will go there and embrass myself. Oh you want Nadia to remind me of how badly married right? That is it! Rebecca money is not everything. Desmond that is every poor man's lie to himself. Money is everything. Desmond. - Desmond. - What is it? Hello. Yes, but I will be a bit late because our flight is slated for 4 pm it means we will be arriving quite late. No no it's okay I don't know what's wrong with all these airlines you know how they are? So... Nadia doesn't have a problem, she doesn't have any problem. Her house is just a stone throw from the place. I am going to see you guys soon... What's the name of the resort again? Okay. Blue waters, I get it. Blue waters resort. I will see you soon. Babe let me call you back. He will sit down and eat all the food in the house. I don't even know the type of man that I married. He would not bring any form of money for support and then he ends up eating all the food in the house. Sometimes it's just better to remain to single than to be married to some kind of men. What kind of some miserable life is this? Goat. It's better to be single. What is this? Where do you think we are going? - What... you don't like what I am wearing? - Of course! I don't like it. - Pink, white, what if, what colour... what is this? - I am going to wear it. What do you want to do? Oh my God. Desmond. What... I'm the man of this house. Can you, can you say it now in a more serious way? - I am the man of this house. - Good. Thank you ma. - You see this? - Yes. This is so wonderful baby. - Baby this is home away from home. - Oh you can say that again. - This is so nice. - Yes. - I'm just glad you love the place. - I do. Yes, we are going to have so much fun. I am sure about that. - Oh I can't wait to see my sisters. - I know. - Oh my God it's been ages. - I know right. - Nadia! - Sly! Sly! - You look great. - You look handsome. Yes, she's feeding me with eba, ponmo. Sly! What's up brother? Common guy you are looking like a million dollars. - Hey! Hi Sly. - Uncle Melvin. - Louisa. How are you? Oh my God you look beautiful. - Thank you. - Now I see where Sly's money is going. - Stop that. Don't... Oh my God... Sly thanks for pulling this together. This place is beautiful. - Oh common this is nothing. - Wow! You know it shouldn't always be work, sometimes you take time off relax and have fun you know. That's what I say boss I was going to call you and tell you that. - Really? - Yes but you beat me to it. Oh my God. - Wow. - What about sister Becky? The last time I tried to call them her number wasn't going through. - The flight is for 4 pm they should be here by now. - Their flight? Did you give them money for flight ticket? - This is women talk. - Sly! How much is flight ticket that they won't be able to afford it? - Oops... fantastic sister. - Sis. Let me try her number again maybe they should be on their way. Let's just go to the reception. You can call them later. - Wow. Look at you. - I'm glad you like it here. My spirit told me about this bus I just don't know why I entered this vehicle. What's wrong with the bus? - Check the battery. - Why didn't you check the car before we left the park? Ordinary Lagos here someone will use the whole day to get there. - I don't like problems. - Baby. - Ha, ha what is it? - My stomach, my stomach is making funny sounds. - Like I want to use the toilet. - Why won't your stomach make funny sounds! You were busy eating every little thing you saw. Desmond, Desmond. Bear it... just hold it. Very soon we'll be in Lagos. - Hello. - Hello sis. Yes Nadia and her husband just got here. Our flight was delayed one hour. I don't know, you know how these airlines are. I really don't know what the problem is. It happens like that all the time, you know how it is. That place is so noisy. The noise? Oh it's a fan. I am standing in front of a fan. - But have you been able to reschedule your flight? - Yes. Don't worry, don't worry dear. I will see you soon. - I just pray they don't delay the flight any longer. - It's a shame. - Okay but wait... we are waiting for you okay. - All right. Take care. - I need to talk to you later network is quite bad. - All right. Okay. Is the bus not yet ready? Desmond why are you dancing? What is wrong with you? How far? - It's ready. Desmond! - It's ready. Desmond! Desmond! The car is ready, the car is ready let's go. Driver is the place still far? Not really... Just about 45 minutes drive. Desmond but I warned you when you were busy eating everything that you... You woke up this morning and you chose to start eating the wrong things. What is this? Desmond don't go and embrass me infront of my sisters. What is smelling here? Something is smelling like a person just defecated on the body or what? Desmond did you poop? Did you poo on your body? Boss you pooed in my car. Wait. Sorry. What are you doing now? - Please come down. - Why are you stopping? What nonsense is this? Why will you poo in my car? - Sorry. - Please come down. Come down. Desmond what kind of embarrassment is this? What kind of a man did I marry? What is wrong with you? - Please sir wait, let's talk about this. - Please come down. Desmond don't sit down there go and talk to him. What is wrong with you? What sort of nonsense is this? Come down. What sort of nonsense is that? Please alight from my car. Oh my God! I'm so happy you made it. - Hi. - Oh my God. Sly. - It's so nice to see you. - Good to see you too. I missed you. - I'm so happy you could make it. - Of course, Of course I would make it. - How was your flight? - Oh yea yea my flight, our fligt was good... Yes it was good. Very good. - So you're here now that's all that matters. - Yes that's what that matters. - Guys where is our room? Can you show our room? - Yes. - What's wrong Des? Are you okay? - No he's... - I'm.. I really need to... - Yes he really needs to. What's that smell? That's exactly what I was trying to tell you. You know I need to... - He has running stomach. - That was you? - What happened is... - More like a dead stomach. No no the... no is something he ate at the..what's it called... at the airport or in flight. He's been having running stomach and he just couldn't hold it. You know what just go to the receiption and ask for your reservation okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - Des! - Your luggage. - I can't carry that bag and you know it. - I will carry someone from the receiption. What's the... what's the room number? - I don't know. - All right guys, let me quickly... - Okay. Okay. - All right. All right. - And take it easy. - Yea. - Welcome! - Thank you mama. Where are you guys going? - We are going to the beach. - Okay. Okay. I'll see you guys. Okay bye. Melv. Let's go. Sorry guys. Guys I want to apologize for what happened earlier on. Today has been one horrible experience for me. It's okay man. - We are glad you are better. - Yea I won't be here if I wasn't better. - They took me to the resort clinlic and I'm fine. - That's great. Very heartlifting. Well I think you should be more careful with what you eat next time. This is the most embarrassing moment one could encounter on a trip. - Very embarrassing. - Running stomach, very terrible. - It could leave one very hopeless and shattered. - Yea you can say it out loud my dear. I'm not going waste time on any of my enemies. Well, I want to officially welcome everyone here for the vacation. I mean we all know why... - Yo, where is your manners man? - Melvin. - He doesn't have any manners. - It's okay Melvin. It's okay. - I don't have manners. - As I was saying... Melvin. Like I was saying! We all know why we are here. But apart from that we are here to have fun, relax and bond with each other. It has always been my wife's wish for this to happen but I kept procrastinating and procrastinating due to my very busy schedule but I'm happy we are finally here. So ladies and gentlemen there's so much fun out there and I say we go catch it. - Yes! - Pass me the wine please. Yea. Here you go. - Here you go baby. - Thank you baby. Pass it on. So... Desmond. The medicine they gave me is now coming out. - To one happy family. - To one happy family. To us. - Cheers guys. - Cheers. Cheers. Let me tell you, Melvin is a very very loving husband and a caring father. Infact I think I'm married to one of the best man in the entire world if not the best man. Well except for the fact that his family people are pressurising you to give him another child. - Who told you that? - Melvin did. It's nothing serious. Yes... Of course it shouldn't be anything serious. I mean you already have a son. Do you know what a son is? Like a king. Listen all these pressures from the family people whatever are putting you under it will die off soon you know as long as you have a child if God thinks you need a child fine but if he doesn't even give you, you already have more than enough so you don't have anything to worry about okay. Sister Becky has spoken. Thank you. So apart from Desmond embrassing himself in public what else have you been going through? Desmond is fine. We are fine. We are doing very good. As a matter of fact, we... he... got promoted recently. Yea. - Really? - To the position of a general manager. - Really? - Yes. - That's nice. - Congratulations. - That's why they gave him the leave anyway. - Oh my God. - That's so nice. - Thank you. - Anyways so this vacation is actually necessary. - Yes. - Yes darling. - To us. - More promotions coming. - Amen. Am sure you guys are wondering why I called you out and left the ladies out. - Yea I have been thinking. - Well it's because I want them to have time for themselves and have their sisterly bonding since they have craving for that for a while. And as men and in-laws I want whatever we discuss here to stay here. I can't agree with you any less Sly. Infact I give you a kudos. - We need time to discuss some personal business you know. - That's good thinking my brother. Well since I've made myself clear on that our businesses, the challenges we are facing, how we can help each other in growing our business. Well for me I will love to help in that regard since we are one by virtue of our marriage. Let's start with you Desmond. - Yea. - What challanges are you facing? - With my wife? - In your entire life like... - My life is my wife. - We are talking about your business. It's a long story. So this guy saw me holding a chicken then he asked me is this a chicken? I said no it's a goat. - I'm glad you are having a good time with your sisters. - Oh yes I am. I'm so excited. Having my sisters here for the first night is so awesome. Thank you so much honey. - Common anything for my sweetheart. I'm glad you are happy. - Yes I am. Come here. Honestly baby me I don't know how your sister can cope with that guy called Desmond. That guy is something else. Can't you see as he was eating like a glutton at the table. - He's a clown. - He is just like that honey. Is not everybody that is expected to be this center modest like you... it's inborn. Ha no no this one is alarming. He has a problem, a major one. You should have seen when Sly called us and asked about our businesses to see where he can assist. He just jumped up like it was Christmas day, you should have seen the list of problems he wrote out. But.. but I thought Becky said he was just recently promoted to the position of a general manager. General what? General who? General manager. My dear that guy was not promoted at all. See he earns just thirty-five thousand naira per month and your sister earns just fifty thousand. They can bearly feed. I even question how they got here if it was truly by plane. Me too. I've always doubted Becky, if there's anybody in my family I'd expected to marry wrongly or not progress it is me. Especially that Becky acting like miss goody two shoes. - Can you imagine? - But God has disappointed all of them and placed Becky in the exact position she expected of me. - Honey let's leave them alone. - Senior manager. - Honey please. - Oh baby. - My love, you know I love you. - I love you too. Baby. Baby. - Baby wait now. Wait. - What. - I thought you were on your period. - Oh no I finished yesterday. - Yes. - Baby I want a head. - I want a head. - No, no baby no, no. Not tonight. Look just wait now... I'm tired okay. Don't worry in the next two days I'll give you whichever way you want it. All right? I tried to overlook and act like it's not there but it's there it's glaring, insulting me, throwing all sorts of shades at me. I tried to ignore the disdain and the hatred she feels towards me but they won't go away. - Are you sure you are not imagining things? - I am not. Today, I lied. I know I lied but this one hurts me. I lied because I couldn't tell them the truth. I... told them that you were promoted to the position of a general manager. What do you mean..are you trying to spoil things for me? - What do you mean spoil things for you? - What if they find out, what if they find out the truth. Nobody is going to find out. I couldn't say the truth because I was too embarrassed to say the truth. I just couldn't say it. Nobody is going to find out, in one week we will be out here and all these will be over. We'll go back to our lives, nobody's going to find out. Ha God. You just want to spoil things for me. General manager at least just say I'm a CEO. - Would you shut up! - Shut up! Can't you be general manager of a company? Can't you? Your mates are out there making money and doing stuffs. General manager doesn't come with a car, it doesn't come with a... - I told them you just got promoted! - Airtime credit. CEO comes with everything. - Bonus... Travel. - You annoy me. General manager learn how to lie well. - Stupid person. - You are a coward. - Fool. - You are a stupid man. Fool. - Hello. - Yes sir. - How are you? - I am fine. Thank you. - Please do you guys sell bush meat here? - Yes, but not here at the palm wine bar. - Where exactly can I get it? - You could get it at the back but not at this time. - I mean you have to come back in the evening. - Okay. All right. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Bye.

Bar man. - Good evening and welcome to our bar. - Tell her what you want. Do you have grasscutter? No we don't have that yet but it will be available tomorrow night.

That's rather too long. They appear to be so much in love. But how are we even sure they are not yet married? How do you date someone for ten years? - Even if you are in school you would have graduated. - Yes. - Well... did you know she was a prostitute? - What! - Prostitute? - And maybe she's still is. - Are you serious? - Yea. - Do you know they met in a brothel? - No, no. And do you know he kept on patronizing her until he fell in love? Wow. So I don't know whether it is post-paid, pre-paid or pay as you go which one? - How can you fall in love with a chief brothel operator? - Now you share my sentiment brother. - Guys listen, listen... - Ten years. Let's not talk about them okay. I don't discuss people. Let's just have our fresh palm wine, have fun and enjoy our meat okay. Okay, talking about them whether brothel, pros-paid whatever. - It's post paid not pros-paid. - Whatever. Pros paid or post-paid is the same thing. What I said you understood me right? - But do you still think she's a prostitute? - How am I supposed to know that? - And which prostitute will go and order grass cutter? - Okay now seriously you seem to be enjoying this whole - prostitute conversation. - If her mouth is sweet that means everywhere is sweet. - Will you stop talking about this? - That means I will order tooto for you. You want tooto? - Is not prostitution. - What's wrong with him? But you said is too much. Yes I said that but then I don't think it's something you need worry yourself about okay. - If you say so. - Really? - Really? - I thought you said that right now. If I say so. - Baby, I am tired.

You know we're here on vacation? - You're Sly's school mate? - Sly! - Is that your school mate? - Yea she's my school mate... Yea. Come on in. Come join us. Your wife is such a good woman, very friendly and understanding. - Like I didn't even know you were married. - Married? She is because they call her my wife. What other intreptation is of a wife if not after marriage. What do I call marriage here? When two people are being forced to live together as husband and wife when they don't know each other. - But why do you have to agree to such arrangement? - What would you have me do? Now I am the prince of our land, her father was a brave warrior who owed my dad the king a lot of money but then he couldn't pay so he gave his daughter as a collateral to my father. There was a war he fought bravely and got injured but then he died at some point leaving the daughter at the palace Now my father got so fond of her because of her dad's bravery he then betrothed her to me without knowing if I love her or not. Now I am to reject her and lose my birthright or accept her and gain my lost glory. - How pathetic. - I know. An object of collateral for a debt to become the future queen? That's a shame you guys need help. Babe... look at me. No look at me, look at me. - What? - You're my idle woman for a queen Cheryl. - I saw that the very first time I set my eyes on you. - Oh please. Not so fast. You're still in a dilema. - You have to fix that first. - Okay if you say so. Yea... You know I would love to stay with you all night long Cheryl. - You sure know how to tease your woman. - Something I inherited from my father the king. Hmm..a rare one at that. My prince you know there's always a next time so why don't you go back to your collateral wife before she declares you missing. - So tell me what does the prince get for good night? - Perphaps a hug. - I got that yesterday. - Okay a peck then. - Nope maybe something deeper more initimate. - Like what? - A kiss. - A kiss? - Then the prince gets a kiss. - Hmm... I do. - Yea. - Okay. Come here. - Where have you been? - Babe. - You're still awake? - I said where have you been! - I was at the bar having a drink. - I went to the bar and you were nowhere in sight! - What bar did you go looking? - The main bar!

You are here. - Yes, yes I was bored and I needed a life. - And your collateral wife? She's gone for spa treatment with her crew. - Are those really her sisters? - Not really, just because we are from the same kingdom hence she calls them sisters. She's just a lone daughter from a dead warrior. - I see. So what promises does the day hold? - A lot my love I came to take you around. - Like seriously? - Let's go catch some fun. - All right okay I will drop this then I will be right back. - Okay sure.

That's disheartening! - Baby did you see the woman who he was cheating on? - You wouldn't believe it Melv. It's Cheryl. - Cheryl! - Yes. - But I thought those were old school mates! - That's what we all thought. Ha! Those two are something else. Sly!

We appreciate you Louisa have a wonderful wedding anniversary have a beautiful married life, keep being happy and Sly. - Congrats. - Thank you so much. Even tho I know Becky you thought about this. This was your idea. - You like it? - I love it. God. It's nice I like it. Everyone. - No sit here. - Baby. Sit here babe. I know Becky is better at this one. She's the brain in the house anyway. Oh my God... Was this a plan? - What plan? - On this very day food poisoning! Becky you know I react to prawns yet you chose to serve me prawns. - It's okay I'm sure she didn't mean it. - Don't you dare tell me what is right and what isn't right. You have no moral justification for this. - Nadia listen calm down. - I have not had one but five prawns encounter with you. - The outcome of my face is that what you miss? - Listen I didn't know there was... Oh my God! - Is there prawns? - No you did not know the meal you organized? I swear I don't even prawns on my plate. - Baby calm down okay it's just prawns. - Yea. Nadia please just calm down I think these days you get easily irriatated. Oh Desmond is that an apology? Oh Nadia it seems you get easily irritated. - Shouldn't I? Infact I am irritated at both of you. - Sis. You Desmond, you make a mere thirty-five thousand naira in fact you are irritation itself. Meanwhile Becky is on the other end singing praises oh my husband he's just got promoted to the position of a general manager. Waiter! - Des didn't get promoted? - No? Anyway today is my special day, so I don't want anyone to come and spoil it okay? Everybody eat your food, we can just take out the prawns okay? Yea. - You snapped at me. - Nadia I don't know what Melvin has done to you in this foul mood but I think you need to apologize to my husband. Leave it there. What's Melvin got to do it? What? She's been this way ever since she got your husband pants down with Cheryl! Baby! What! You didn't know your husband was making out with Cheryl? Yes! She caught them. And she's been irritated ever since then. Tell me what Melvin just said is not true. He can't deny it. Or am I lying? - Baby... - Shut up! - Don't you dare insult my husband! - What sort of a husband is he! - Don't you dare insult my husband! - I will insult your husband cause you're a stupid person! What kind of a man are you! Must you say everything you see? Of all days, of all places! This is a useless man sitting right here calling himself your husband! - And what of the one you are married to? - What is wrong with you? - Shut up you fat pauper! - Excuse me! - I will slap you if you point...! - You try it! You try it! - I will slap you! - You try it Becky! - If you point hands at my husband again! - Try it! Listen at this point I just want to say that some people here are just being selfish okay? - Rubbish! - Marvin I suggest you shut up and you keep your mouth shut Because a few days ago I overheard you telling strangers that your wife's vagina smells every time she's done with her period so please... Baby! Baby! You said that about me! Fuck! Babe, babe what are you doing? What are you doing? - Stop it. - Leave me alone! Babe don't do it I beg you. Give me one reason why I shouldn't. Because I'm sorry. Because you are sorry? Because you are sorry? You do not have respect for me. You do not have respect for my sisters. You do not have respect for my family! Ha God! Just let me pack my things and leave this place so you can have enough time with your whores or you can even have enough time to go to the beach and have a quickie. Listen to me I don't want you to blow this out of proportion. It was just guardless fling that I had with her I didn't intend for it to happen. I don't love her it is you that I love so please don't do this. Please do not patrronize me okay. Do not. I'm tired of your lies, I have had it up to here with your lies okay. And this is going to be the last time you will ever lie to me again. Hey baby stop listen to me. It is you that I love and got married to not her! Why are you doing this? It was just a fling! A fling Louisa! So my husband is now allowed to have flings. Let me ask you just one question. Did you use a condom? God. Oh God Sly, Sly. You are even the bigger fool than I thought. Ha God. How can you have an unprotected sex with another woman? You don't even know her medical history! God. And so if she has interception you'll just go pick it up and pass it on to me? You're even more stupid than I thought. - And where are you going? - It is none of your business. I can no longer share a bed with an idiot like you! Leave me alone. Damn it! What the fuck. You told my sister's husband that my private part smells? My husband says that about me? Have you ever told me about my body? What you feel? It wasn't like that now. The guys were only talking about how they couldn't stand women with dirty punanies and I just made an example. With me? Does my private part smell? I'm asking you a question! Honestly... only after your period. What regards do you think Sly and Desmond would have of me after discussing me like that to them? Why are you so insensitive to let such a secret of Sly and Louisa come out of your mouth come out so easily. Why are you cursed with such a porous lips! You're a man Melvin, men don't gossip. They keep the doors of their lips closed with padlock. I'm sorry. I already said I'm sorry. It was just a mistake, a very costly one. - My God. - I'm so sorry baby. I'm sorry. Oh my God. I don't know how Louisa will be going through. How... what she will be going through right now. It's better to be single than to be married to such a man like you. Haha! I know that I am not married to a man that talks so I'm going to ask you nicely. How did Melvin know that you earn thirty-five thousand naira and why did you say that about my sister? Look it was supposed to be between us men he asked how business was doing and I told him everything and he offered his help. I don't have a problem with you getting help but what I have a problem with is you getting it in front of Melvin. Didn't you know it will come out? Put us in a bad light and earn us mockery? Mockery. Let me explain something to you. Next year by this time Melvin and the wife will have nothing to mock us with trust me. - I mean if it's about the cheque I can return the cheque. - No. And my sister why did you say that? I'm sorry. Sometimes you can damn right annoying. - I'm a man. - Oh shut up. - I have to love you more. - What man are you? What man are you? What man are you? Cheryl how could you! You knew you were sleeping with my husband and yet you allowed me to introduce you to my family? Why did you even come into my camp? - What husband! - Don't deny this. Don't because my sister saw you pants down having sex or making love or whatever it is you were doing with my husband at the beach! I'm not denying anything the prince told me you're not his wife you are just a collateral for the debts you owe his father and after your father died the king became so fond of you and decided that you and the prince should get married but the prince refused to... - Stop all these rubbish! Who told you these? - The prince. - Who is the prince! - The one you call your husband. That lying bastard. Cheryl he lied to you. He lied to me? He lied to me just to get down with me. He is not a prince. I am his wife we're legally married in the church. I came here with my sisters so we can celebrate my one year anniversary. Oh..Oh my... Oh my God. - Oh Sly. - Oh my God. I've been deceived. Oh that's what I hate the most in my life. Sleeping with another woman's husband. Louisa I'm so sorry I didn't... I didn't know. Please forgive me. It's not your fault Cheryl you. You just a victim of my husband's lying lips. Oh my God. Look guys. I'm sorry I didn't mean to spill the beans the way I did you know but the deed is done okay just don't let it get the better part of you okay. I mean every man cheats don't let them feel like you're the only one cheating. My brother not all men cheat, some men cheat you see if you want to cheat you have to cheat discretly you have to respect your woman's feelings and vision and eye sight cheat but cheat discretly. Yea I think Desmond is right I acted reckless and got my cables burnt. Ha shit you burnt your cables big time, big time. How is she holding up? I've not set my eyes on her since she left the canbanal last night. What? Where did she pass the night? No, no she slept in our canbanal. She just cried all through the night. - She's really hurt. - I know I hurt her so much. I had no right. I'm an idiot for acting this wrong on our vacation. A big one! A big damn idiot. Don't worry at least you are remorseful now so everything is okay. - See let me tell you how to, if you want to cheat... - Desmond shut up. - Don't save their name... - Desmond shut up! - As side chick. - I said... - You can save the side chick. - Are you still talking I said shut up. - If you talk you're not going to get that business help. - Househelp, secretary, gateman. There are two kinds of cheating men those who own to their mistakes after being caught. And those who don't. I am happy that Sly is not among those people who do not. - It does not change anything. - It changes everything. You see men who don't own up to their mistakes they end up blaming you for everything that has happened. - Who's that? - It's Nadia. Come in. How can you let her come near you after all she said to you? That is the same way I want you to forgive Sly if he's truly sorry. Nadia is different, everything she said to you, you just want her to come in just like that. I don't know how to say it. My heart was heavy towards Sly and I didn't know how to say what I saw because I didn't want to hurt you. And Becky? What was her offence? Tell me! You're too selfish Nadia, you're too selfish cause I can recall everything you said about Becky and now you just stroll in here to tender your weak apology? Well I am not Becky I do not forgive you and I never want to see you again. - I'm sorry what more can I do? - You've come to me or better still go to Becky! - Not your husband for Christ sake! - Are you blaming me that Sly cheated! - Yes! No! I'm blaming you for... - You people should stop it, stop it. Listen this is not the way forward I mean you guys can't just start blaming each other that's not that's not right. Nothing I do or say is not always right but if it's Becky, Becky is perfect. Nadia if you came here to apologize render that apologhy and get out of my room. Are you serious? You have to bring me into this? I know that I can not force you to like me, I know that I can not force you to care about me and I know I cannot force you love me but please understand in this situation I am not your problem! I never said you were my problem! If it was you who caught Sly cheating she would never have blamed you irrespective of how you handle the situation but if it's me nothing I do is ever right. Please do not accuse me of not loving you enough because God in heaven knows that I have given all the love I have inside of me and it's just never enough for you. That is your problem! I'm sor... I'm sorry. I never meant to ruin your party. - Becky you know I would never do anything like that. - I don't know anything, I don't, don't call my name. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry, sorry. Hi Cheryl. You lying bastard! You led me on! Sly what do you still want from me! What do you want from me! Or are you here to tell me that your father is the president - and rules the country! - I'm sorry. What! Your sorry is so useless right now. You can even strangle me Sly, you can even strike instead of lieing and pretending to be... just go! You've done enough damage Sly, just go I never want to see you again. You've done enough damage Sly, just go I never want to see you again. Even though I lied to be with you what I feel for you is real. I meant it when I said you swept me off my feet and you still do. Sly just go leave me alone. I never want to see you again. You really want me to go? Just go! Okay I'll go. - Louisa. - Hi, how are you? Babes I was wrong, I wronged you. I have sinned against God himself. I have abused and rubbished the solemn promise I made to my loving wife at the the sacred altar of God. I am so ashamed of myself I don't deserve to be a called a husband. - So you know sis please. - Babe baby - Leave me alone. - Baby I'm sorry please. Sis don't touch me with those fllthy hands. You can go ahead with your illicit affairs okay. Atleast now you have enought time to do that. - Baby... Louisa. - Get out. How is she? She's asleep. Yea I hope she is feeling better because the way I saw her she wasn't looking good at all. Yea. I'm going to convince her to forgive him. But not yet. I think he needs to suffer a little bit more. I mean look at the emotional torture he has put my sister through. And Nadia on the other hand is there feeling guilty that she talked. That she should have just ignored and kept quiet about it. No, no she shouldn't feel guilty about it. The only person I blame is that boy he should learn to put his third leg in place I mean you can't just be going around just removing your third leg. What kind of life is that? Look there's a saying if you're living in a glass house you shouldn't throw stones. You should be made to suffer... they should really suffer, suffer well, well, well. His punishment should be that he suffers well, he should learn from his mistakes - So do you put your third leg in place? - I keep my third and fourth and fifth in place. Hey Cheryl. Where are you going to with your luggage and all dressed up? - I'm leaving. - Why? I'm leaving let me just leave here and free myself from this guilt. - Just... I need to just go. - We ruined your vacation right? No I... I ruined it the first time I allowed him get away with that lie. How could he even say I'm his school mate? - And I didn't even tell you. - See it's not your fault okay. My husband is so swift with words, he can even brainwash an angel with his lies. And to think... I was coming here to clear my head after I saw my fiance with a woman - Really? - I thought I was running away from dirty water but I got myself in to a deeper one. Mybe I'm just too vulnerable. May... that's why I keep getting myself in this kind of mess. - I'm so sorry. - Trust me there's nothing to be sorry about. - Trust me. - So sorry. It's okay. You're a good girl okay. Just take care of yourself. - You're such a good woman. I wish women were like you. - It's okay. - Good bye. - Good bye dear. Take it easy okay. Cheryl. Cheryl. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. I ruined your vacation. I'm sorry. But you know Sly in every... bitter experience there's a lesson to be learnt. I've learnt mine. - I hope you've learnt yours? - Yes I have. Your wife is a really wonderful woman if you lose her you can't get another like her. Guard her with everything okay. Goodbye Sly. - Guys are you sure she will come? - Of course she will come. I'm sorry guys for keeping you waiting. It's all right. Baby, baby, baby please don't go. I know hurt you so much, I have wronged you in the eyes of God and man. Please forgive me I promise I will never never cheat on you again. I'm sorry. - You hurt me Sly, you really hurt me. - I know and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgive you. Just get up. - Get up. - You heard her man. Get up. Thank you. Thank you. I want to say thank you to you guys for making this possible. Thank yourself. Thank your head. Thank your guts. Anyways I went through hell and back this past few days and like they say... One doesn't know what he has until he's at the verge of loosing it. - Who said that? - Pope John Paul. And whilst I was going through all these suffering all I could think about was what I went through before they allowed me to marry her. And because of my fleshy desires I almost ruined everything. Talking about the deal which you went through, you know what I went through? Her father almost made me pass throught the eyes of a needle before he allowed me to marry Nadia. Mehn, I went through hell with that family. - Really? - But on the contrary I didn't go through hell at all. Everything was just smooth, I just went there and said Baba I want to marry your daughter. Okay take... finish. What do you expect? Duh. That's because Becky already has a son. Yes from a rape by their servant when she was just thirteen. Duh. - What do you mean Becky had a son? - Ha! You didn't know. - No I don't know. - By their servant when she was thirteen. She knows, she knows, Becky is right here and can't deny it. - Desmond, Desmond wait. - I didn't know. - And how am I suppose to know? - You're such a kill joy. - And how am I suppose to know? - Oh shut up Melv. You're a lousy idiot! - Hey hey don't insult me. - And if I do what would you do? - I just... - What will you do! I don't know what I will do! I just said I didn't know. - How am I suppose to know that I did... - Shut up! - Did you know? - Shut the fuck up! - How can I be crucified for something I did not know. - Melvin! I said shut up! Did I know? Is that one a secret? Melvin! How could you? How could you let such a secret out your mouth so easily? A secret that was kept for fifteen years, that secret I told you because you're my husband! How is it a secret when she knew, you knew, three people already know. - Now you've said set my whole sister all against me. - No that was not my intention. I was only sharing the news. You shamed me to be called my husband! You are a disgrace to manhood Melvin! I did not know. What... How is it a secret when three people already knew? - You take me for a fool. - No. How many years have we been married but yet you keep this a secret from me. - I'm sorry. - And you're asking me to forgive you? - I can't! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry Desmond. I wanted to tell you, I was just too afraid you were going to leave me. Everyone was treating me like a plague. You were the only one that showed interest in me. - I didn't want to lose you. - So now it's an open secret! It's an open secr... everybody here knows. - Everybody knows. - Desmond calm down. - I don't think I can be with someone like you. - Desmond please. - I don't think so. - Desmond please. Desmond please. Oh my God. Nadia has finished me. Nadia has killed me. Honey are you still mad at me? You haven't said anything since we came here. I promise I would never make you cry again. That's not why I'm worried. I'm worried for my sisters. This will tear them apart. This is a secret to be over to keep. That's always with Bre but Nadia... Oh Nadia why? But babe how... how did it happen? It's a painful experince Becky will never like to recall. She was like twelve or thirteen when one useless idiot of a man forced himself on her and the boy ran out of our house. He battered her and wounded her. My dad was so devasted he jailed him up till nobody know if he died in prison. That truma still lives in Becky and I don't know why Nadia's so called lousy husband decided to just open this wound. Becky tried to kill herself when she found she was pregnant. But my father being the night of saint John of course he would never endorse an abortion. So that's one of the reason why she married Desmond out of shame. - Who knows what's going to happen to my sister? - Nothing. Stop baby. It's okay, it's okay. Can you listen to me nothing is going to happen to your sister. I promise now we are going to solve this once again as a family okay. It's okay. Stop crying. Becky how could you do this? I told you. I told you to tell him but you won't listen. See what you've done to yourself. How would he trust me? How would he even listen to me? I just couldn't tell him, I just couldn't tell him. Oh God what am I going to do now? I just... Desmond. I know that you are very mad at me. I know that what I've done is very wrong but please come inside. Atleast you can sit inside. I can't leave you like this. I can't leave you here. Desmond. Baby please. Baby please I beg you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry please. Desmond please. Honestly I didn't tell it to Marvin because I wanted to hurt or mock my sister. I told him the truth because he wanted to... he found the truth about destiny and wanted to know who the real mother is and perhaps it was... And perhaps he thought he was yours and you were lying to him. - I thought as much but you should have told something else. - I didn't know what to tell him. Besides this thing didn't just happen. It happened in our first year of marriage. I didn't know he was a gossip then. I thought he was going to keep the secret. See, standing here brooding and wailing over this will not solve any problem. Why don't you just talk to Becky I'm sure she will understand. I've tried. She wouldn't even look at me. I've hurt her so badly. It's okay. So you're going to try, try and try and try again until you succeed okay. Okay. - Sis. - Becky. Becky, please. - Please just listen to her. - Becky I'm sorry please. Becky, please I'm sorry forgive me, Becky. Please, forgive me please. Perhaps you forget that I am not the only one with secrets here. How about we go meet that lousy husband of yours and tell him that you have a secret you wouldn't want him to know about. When the doctor told you that you didn't have a fallopian tube. I kept it for you infact I don't even remember that you have a secret like that. You lost your fallopian tube based on series of abortions that you did and I was there for you. When the doctors said you couldn't bear more than one child, I was there for you and I kept your secret because you are my sister, I kept it I didn't even remember that it exist and just this one thing that I ask you for you couldn't keep it. It wasn't even my fault, It wasn't even my fault but yours was born out of your recklessness and I kept it. What are you sorry about? Don't! Get out! - Forgive me. - Get out! I don't know what you have against me, I don't know what I did to you! I'm sorry. Becky please. Don't tell me you're sorry. You're not sorry. - I'm sorry. - You're not sorry. It was a moment of indecision please I will mean to actually... - Why... - Sis I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell your husband about your own secrets in a moment of indecision. - Do you always talk about me in your home? - No. Why? As far I am concerned Louisa is the only sister I have. - No! - Don't touch me! I am not your sister and I don't want to ever, ever see you again. - Becky. - It's okay. I didn't mean to hurt her. Sis. Why will Nadia betray me like this? You know if you were in my shoes, do you know what you would have told me? You would have said give it up Louisa. Nadia is your sister and you know that blood ties are difficult to break. So now I want us to reverse the situation. Please Becky, please give it up. No doubt Nadia messed up no doubt but then why don't we see it as God trying to vindicate you and your son? You've been without him all these years now that your husband knows about him you can just you know go get him so you can make up for lost time. Please, Becky please just give it up please. I don't see you like this Desmond. I see you to be the most humble, calm and the most reasonable amongst us. You have showed great understaning at other's faults but why is it so difficult with your wife? Let me tell you something I'm just pissed off and angry because she could keep something like this away from me, what if she's keeping another secret away of such magnitutude. She's not the only one in this, her entire family decided to keep it a secret including my wife. It was really an act of rape. She didn't call this upon her. Some families would have agreed to abort the child but no she kept her womb intact and refused to take the life of an innocent child. - I don't want you to blame for her noble act I beg you. - Look I'm not angry because of all those things I'm not angry because she was raped or because she has a child. I'm angry she doesn't know how much I love her, how much I trust her for her tell me such secret. I mean how can she bear this alone, how can she handle this alone. I know. Just let it go okay. That's the only reason why I am angry. - She's coming here. - It's... Desmond. - Des... - What? Des look at me. Just forgive her. I'm sorry. Please I'm sorry. Desmond I miss you. I'm sorry. How could you do something like this to me? I'm sorry. The child, is it a boy or a girl? It's a boy. Actually, you've met him - Destiny. Destiny? Can I adopt him? - So I can have one son and two daughters. - Desmond thank you. Desmond thank you so much and I'm so sorry. - Thank you. - You're putting makeup on my shirt. - You're putting makeup on my shirt! - Desmond can't you be serious for once? I just washed this shirt. Guys... I just want to say I'm sorry. I've caused a lot of trouble in the few days that we've been here with my running mouth. Just forgive me and it will never happen again. - Perhaps because there are no secrets to blow out. - But I just said I am working on my mouth. Better get a padlock and lock it. I'm sorry. Forgive me. - Becky. - No no no it's fine. It's fine, totally it's fine, it's okay. Hey did you guys know that Sly gave him six million naira in a cheque for his business. You didn't tell her?
