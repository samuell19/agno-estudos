[video game voice] Ready? Go. [bottles clank, fridge door closes] Hello. I guess you don't take the card under a tenner, right? [coins rattle] [door opens and closes] [cell phone chimes] [voice chattering over video game] [doorbell rings] [woman] Hi. What do you want? Nice to see you too. - I don't know. - [door closes] To check up on you? You came here to check up on me? I'm worried about you. You look tired. Stop, Chloe. What do you really want? The final part of Paranoia starts today. - Get out. - I'm serious. We're only one level short of entering the game. Only one puzzle left to solve. - Get out of here. - I'm sure you can solve it. No one's ever been as far as you in Paranoia. I don't give a shit. Do you understand? It's all over, Chloe. Are you listening to me? - It all begins today. - No, you listen to me. I haven't seen your face in months, and the first thing you want to do is come in here and talk to me about this bullshit. We spent a year 24/7 sitting in front of our computers, searching for a lead, for nothing. You're not interested in the million-euro prize? I don't want to go back to that place. It destroyed us. [scoffs] You know that's not what destroyed us. Just think of what the two of us could do with a million euros. The two of us? I read an article in the paper about two black swans that disappeared from the zoo in Manchester. Two black swans. That's the emblem of Paranoia. That's just a coincidence. Except that the zoo never had any black swans. I checked it out. - That is weird. - I wrote to the zoo. I got a message back: "24 be careful." "24 be careful," that must be a code. Twenty... okay, two numbers, two words. Could tell you the zip code. So let's just assume A equals 1, B equals 2, C equals 3, D equals 4. You get 24, which equals BD. What is it, "Be careful"? [mouthing] First letter of each words are B and C, which is 23. So you get BD23. There you go, the home page of Skipton City, zip code: BD23. "Preservation of our ecosystem"... "Protection of the black swan." This is it. "A year on the road "brings us back to the same place, as always. We'll be there tonight until midnight." What does it mean? "A year on the road brings us back..." Type in "01" into the first box. "Brings us back to the same place... as always." Try the infinity symbol. "We'll be there tonight until midnight." Type today's date: 0811. It's not working. Okay, go back. "A year on the road..." 01 again. Let's try 00 instead of the infinity. 08... You've got it. A rave in Skipton. You're a genius. Let's find it. [knock on door] [whispers] Mum? Please, may I ask you something? You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you. But I'm going to go for a ride with Chloe tonight, if that's okay. I know what you're thinking, that she's hurt me too much, and. Please can you just forgive me for still being in love with her? Sorry, I'm going to have to clean my car one of these days. You can put that in the back if you want. No rave in sight so far. - There. - Where? There, over there, I can see it. [dance music throbbing] [dance music blaring] I don't get it. If we're on Paranoia's playground, who's running the show? Like, who's paying for all this? And who are all these people? Like, are they real partiers or are they part of the game? Shit. Naomi's here. I'm guessing she's still in the game then. [Chloe] More than ever. But if she's here, that means we're on the right track. Come on, let's find Paranoia's entrance before she does. - Can you hear that? - What? The music of Swan Lake. [dance music blaring] - That's techno. - No, no, no, no. It's in the distance. It's... It's further. Come on. [Chloe] What the hell. [video game] You are late. [Chloe] There is only one joystick. - How do we play each other? - We play against the computer. - Do you want to go first? - No, thanks. [video game chatters] [Lucas] Ah... Go, go, go, go, go. - [pounding console] - Shit. Your turn. [video game] Round one. Fight. [tapping buttons rapidly] [both characters grunting] Yes! [video game cackles] You should hurry up. You still have a long way to go. So, where are we going now? Okay there's the GPS coordinates. Let me check. Got it. There's Paranoia. Looks like it. [door slams] They're waiting for you. [door unlocks and opens] [door closes] There's cameras everywhere. It's normal. They have to monitor the game. Sorry, guys, we started without you. [Ray] Welcome anyway. I am Ray. I'm Maxine. Jablowski. I'm Chloe. So you're back in the game? I haven't seen you online for a while. [intercom blares] [feedback squeals] [voice] Welcome to Paranoia, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, we wish to congratulate you. Of the thousands of hopefuls, only you made it all the way here. This competition was created for you. It will push your abilities to the limit. It will exploit your weaknesses and test you like never before. This hospital is your playground. It's furthermost recesses, it's darkest corners, are yours for the entire duration of the game. You're about to play a gigantic escape game. You'll need to solve puzzles to get out of each room and move on to the next level. Every time you exit a room, you will be given a piece of the puzzle. You've already found the first piece on the table. Once complete, the puzzle will reveal the combination to the exit of the hospital. You have been divided into teams of two. The first team to exit the hospital wins the million-euro prize. Be aware that you will not be allowed to leave the game once it has begun. Finally, does anyone among you want to give up and leave now? This is your last chance. [intercom disconnects] [door opens] [sighs] Chloe? [intercom blares] [voice] As you can see, you are all isolated to start the game. Now, you must find your teammate to stay in the game. Three, two, one. Go. [grunts and pants] Chloe? Chloe, can you hear me? Lucas? Lucas, I can hear you. There's a vent connecting our two rooms. - Do you see it? - Yeah, I see it. I found a key, but it doesn't open any locks. Does it fit the door? [Chloe] It doesn't have a lock. Does it have a metal plate on it too? No, not even. How am I supposed to open this fucking door? Okay, right. Chloe, I've got it, okay? If you can't open it, then it has to be me. I need you to throw the key down, is that okay? [Chloe] Done. [sighs] No, it's not far enough. I've got it, I've got it. Okay, wait there, Chloe. [lock clicks] Hey. Okay, let's go. Okay, now look for Room 7. Here. Okay. Whoa, what is this place? Okay, so, I mean, I'm guessing we have to exit back through this door? And there's a keypad here, so we need to find some sort of code. [monitor buzzes] Do you think we have to put this thing on? [monitor buzzes] Yes. Okay, okay, I'll do it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Come on, don't be a pussy. Help me into it. Okay. Okay, now look around. There must be a riddle that we have to solve. [whirring] Oh, no. Okay, no, no, no, no. I don't like this at all, Chloe. Don't move. We need to get out of here now. What do we do if I can't get out in time? - [mechanics whirring] - Don't come. Find the riddle. Hurry. Okay, it looks like a puzzle, so I think... some of the pieces are black on the back, so I'm going to have to make some sort of pattern here. Here we go. Oh, my God. [whirs] Okay. [whirring] - What are you doing? - Look, it's taking shape. I don't understand. You can see the swan here, Chloe. Well, you must be doing something wrong. I can't, Chloe. I give up. It's too dangerous. - No, no, no, no, - I'm going to try to untie you. No! Finish the swan. Finish the swan. Trust me. I can see something. Keep doing it. Are you out of your fucking mind? Lucas, one minute left. Make the fucking swan. I can see numbers. I can see numbers. I need the blades to come closer to me, to read them. God. Oh, God. [groans] Okay, Lucas. Lucas, I got it. I see it. First row: 5, 30 and 6. Second row: 3... the one in the middle is missing, and then... number 7. Okay, so we need to find the missing number. Lucas, ten seconds left! Five times six is 30. Okay, I've got it. So 5x6 is 30, 3x7 is 21. So we got here, we got... 5, 30, 6, 3, 21, 7. Okay, got it. Chloe, what the fuck are we doing here? Fucking psychos. Now look for Room 11. Let's go. - Chloe... - Come on! Chloe, can't you see there's something wrong with this place? - [punches wall] - Chloe! Are you listening to me? [door opens] Help! Help! Is anyone out there? Shit. What's the number of the room again? Eleven. Ah! Damn it! - Damn it. - [yells] They're ahead of us now. Well... okay, well, let's look. Let's try another room. Maybe we can get into the game again from there? [distant piano music] [sighs] Can you hear that? No, wait, it's coming from this way. [piano music playing louder] - [jiggles doorknob] - Shit, shit! [panting] Do you think the game continues here? I don't know. Let's look for clues. And let's not waste any time. I don't want the others to destroy us. Okay, let's take a look at the bookshelf over there. Do you know your classical music? A little bit. You? [Chloe] No. There's a padlock here. There's a Swan Lake score on every shelf. So there's three shelves. And that bottom lock's three digits, right? - Yeah. - Okay so the first shelf is fourth position. - Four... - The second shelf is seventh position, - Seven... - And the third shelf is ninth position. It's not working. Oh, God. [playing] Wait, wait, wait, wait. There is a score marked "479." Chopin's Ballad in G minor. Are they trying to kill us here or what? - Hurry. - Look for an Irish composer. - Why Irish? - Ireland's missing on that map. Okay. Albert Ketelbey? [Lucas] English. - Learmont Drysdale? - Scottish. Oh, my God. Oh, there is a book here. The Purloined Letter. Edgar Allan Poe. He's Irish, right? No, he's American. We need to find an exit now. We need to go. Okay, this one, this one. Breve Deliran? You know this composer? No. On, wait, Deliran. Deliran is an anagram for Ireland. And Breve? What is Breve? Double whole note. - So it's in the score? - Okay, let me check the pages. Okay, page four is six breves. - Six... - Page seven is three breves. Three. And page nine is eight breves. Six-three-eight. It's working, it's working. [Chloe screams] It's gonna take us ages to go through all this. - Calm down. - The room's on fire. - Then solve the riddle. - What riddle, Chloe? I don't even know if this is part of it. - Maybe we're stuck in here. - I got it, I got it. [reading in Spanish] - How is your Spanish? - The pianist, where did he go? Lucas! - My Spanish is terrible. Yours? - Same. So, what do we do then? I don't know. You're the fucking whiz kid. You find it, get us out of here. The Purloined Letter. - What? - The Purloined Letter. Oh... Uh... [plays piano] [Chloe] Look. - [explosion] - [screams] How did you find out we had to finish the piano piece? Well, as Poe said in The Purloined Letter, you know, the best place to hide a treasure is the most conspicuous place, because people won't think to search there. It's too obvious, you know? So they're looking for more intricate leads. So Ireland and all the other places are just false leads. And the most conspicuous thing was the piano. Of course. What do the papers say? "We are equal in the face of it." The law? Death? Don't tell me this is what I think it is. What the fuck? [Lucas sighs] The keypad. The keypad is more complicated this time. Digits from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F. [scoffs] Seems like a normal deck. I think all the cards are here. That's one, two, three... - [gasps] - What, what? - Oh, my God. - Chloe, what? What? [breathing heavily] Calm down, okay? Calm down, it's okay. Could just be a false alarm. It's okay. [cries] [Chloe] Is that part of the game? [shushing] It's okay. It's okay, calm down. What is this fucking place? [pounding on door, doorknob rattles] [pounding on door] - Okay, go and get the tables. - Okay, okay, okay. [doorknob rattles] Okay, hold the door, Chloe. Hurry, Lucas! - [pounding on door] - [gasps] Hurry! [Chloe grunting] I'm coming, okay. Turn this to the side and put it by the door. No! Fuck! Do you remember the code? [Lucas] Try C... C-A-2-1-9-9. Okay, hurry up, Chloe. - That's not working. - C-A-2-1-0-7. That's it! Come on! I managed to grab the puzzle piece but not the paper. [Lucas] Shit, where do we go now? [whistling] He's still after us, this fucking freak. Okay, go, go, go, go. [door creaks] - How do we get out? - This way, this way, this way. This place is a labyrinth. The door. Lucas? Lucas! [jiggles doorknob] Lucas! Chloe? Don't leave me here! [Lucas] I can't get the door open! - [distant whistling] - [pounding on door] Chloe! Chloe! Chloe! [panting] - [grunts] - [jiggles doorknob] [groans] [grunts] Help, help. Help! Somebody come. No, no, no, no, no, no. [intercom blares] [voice] Did you know that our memory skills improve when we understand that every mistake we make results in punishment? Like when your parents spanked you when you were wrong? You're about to experience it. Please just leave me alone. Please, leave me alone, you psychos. [voice] We will measure the extent to which punishment can affect memory. I will give you a series of 11 word pairs. A noun, followed by an adjective. Then I will give you the adjective, and you will tell me the noun it refers to. We will repeat the process ten times in total. Every mistake will be punished. A minimum of five correct answers will set you free. What if I don't get five correct answers? [voice] Mind, sick. Corpse, cold. Cross, black. Dungeon, dark. Mother, mystery. Circle, colored. Treasure, buried. Soul, flying. Presence, absent. Wind, violent. Murderer, innocent. Dark. Dungeon. Correct. Next word: flying. Sky. Wrong. [electricity humming] [whimpering] Mystery. I repeat. Mystery. [sobbing] - Chloe... - Wrong. [electricity humming] [sobbing] Next word: colored. Circle. Correct. Next word: violent. - I don't know. - Wrong. [electricity humming] [groaning] It seems like you have a masochistic streak. Well, I have some good news: the shocks will keep getting stronger. Next word: cold. I don't know. Wrong. [electricity humming] [whimpering] Next word: sick. Take your time to make sure you give me the correct answer. Concentrate. - Your voice sounds familiar. - Wrong. [electricity humming] You only have three questions left. This is your last chance. As you've now already given five incorrect answers, you have no room for error now. [wheezing] Next word: murderer. Guilty. Finish him off. No, no, no... [electricity humming] - [electricity crackles - [screams] [breathing heavily] [distant whistling] [shaky breathing] [gas hisses] [grunts and screams] - [screams] - [sizzling] [distant whistling] [jiggles doorknob] [distant clatter] [gasps] Chloe, it's me. You should never have said yes this morning. We wouldn't have found the rave. We wouldn't be locked up in a fucking nuthouse. Chloe? [sighs] Why didn't you tell me you spent time in a psychiatric hospital? I didn't want you to think I was crazy. Someone would hang crosses on my door. Every day, for months. Every single day. I never found out who it was. And then it got to me. And I fell into a depression, and... ended up in a mental hospital. When I came out, the crosses reappeared. So I moved out. Things have been pretty hectic for me since we broke up, you know. Since broke up, you mean. You forced me to break up. How come you never told me about how your mother died? [sighs] I was 16, and... she was killed by burglars. [sighs] I was at a party, and I got so drunk that I came home and I passed out, and I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear them coming in. I didn't hear them killing my mother. Nothing. She must have cried for help, you know? She must have thought I was going to come around the corner and I was going to save her. [sighs] I just feel so guilty. And they were searching for something in the basement. I don't... I don't know what it was, but it must have been something important, you know, to her. But they never went to the basement. I always wanted to go down into the basement, you know? But I never did, because I just... I felt like I was betraying her. Lucas. [Lucas sighs] [Chloe] Lucas. - I'm sorry. - [sniffles] Ow. Check this out. [Lucas] Looks like Naomi. Wait, was she a patient here? It's written on her file. "Dangerous patient." She looks like 16 or 17 there. It must have been ages ago. Look what's written. "Keep away from sharp objects, pens, keys, screwdriver." Maxine had a screwdriver stuck in her throat, remember? She was probably committed here when she was a teenager for other issues, but now she wants revenge from all the years she was locked up. And she wants to take it out on innocent gamers? No, I don't believe that. I'm serious, Lucas. I'm sure it's her. We need to get one more piece, then we've completed the puzzle. Come on, let's take this. Let's go. [both gasp] "You will now ascend into heaven." "You will now ascend into heaven." "You will now ascend into heaven." "You will now ascend into heaven." [metallic object clangs] I can't believe it. He was right there in front of us the whole time. [door slamming distantly] Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's coming towards us. - I think that's going away. - [door opens] Jablowski. Is Naomi not with you? No, she disappeared a while ago. Did you guys see what happened to Maxine? Yeah. And Ray got killed too. What? When was the last time you saw Naomi? She opened the door after we solved a riddle and walked out. When I went out after her, she was gone. Was that before or after what happened to Maxine? Before. I wasn't with her anymore when I found Maxine's body. - Did you know Naomi before you came here? - Why all these questions? Because she was a patient here ten years ago. You kidding me? What's that all about? It's about a psycho killing escape gamers - with a screwdriver. - Hang on, maybe she's dead too. You know, that's just how the game goes. The game? This isn't about a game anymore, do you not understand? This is about a fucking killer chasing us down hallways. The game is still on, and we are opponents. What? That doesn't make sense, Jablowski. We're stronger as a team, surely. [Jablowski] Yeah, good luck! [sighs] "You will now ascend into heaven." What could that mean? I don't know. Maybe the next level is taking us outside in the daylight. Yeah, it's clever, but it's just... It's too religious. Religious. A chapel? Maybe there is a chapel in the hospital? Yeah, I... I still don't understand why that door opened earlier, after I electrocuted the nurse. Because if they're not testing my intelligence, then I... What are they testing? Your ability to kill. Look at that painting. It looks like the one in your living room. Yeah. Yeah, it does. It looks like my mother's favorite... That's weird. How come a painting painted by a patient in a mental hospital ended up in your house? I have no idea. [Naomi, whispering] There is no way out. [Chloe] What are we doing now? Okay, well, we're not going to turn back now. Let's just go quietly, okay? Just go through there. [Naomi, whispering] You are screwed... Lucas... There's no way... out. Just hold this down, okay? [Naomi, whispering] We... are screwed. [Lucas] Naomi? We just want to keep going through, okay? That's all. We not going to make any sudden movements. We just want to keep going. That's it. Why the bars? We not going to hurt you, I promise. Why are you carrying bars then? Because we need to know that you don't want to hurt us either. Okay? Why is everyone scared of me? It's always been like that, since I was little. [Lucas] Naomi... you know that somebody's been killed in the game, right? I know. I saw the bodies too. Where were you when the murders happened? I don't know. Okay, Naomi, I need you to take that out of your pocket now. Okay? Slowly, slowly, slowly, and just put it on the floor very slowly. Very slowly. Someone put it in my pocket. Why would you do that, Naomi? Chloe, don't. I always knew you were a weirdo, but that? - Don't, Chloe. - You've been playing Paranoia from your hospital room all this time? - Naomi, Naomi. - Stay away from me! - You too. - [Lucas] Calm down. You fucking back off! You're trying to make me think I'm fucking crazy. I'm not. You're trying to use my frailty to make me believe I did it without even being aware of it. - Calm down. - [grunts] But it won't work. I know what I did and didn't do. - [Lucas] Okay. - So how did I kill them? Their sleep? [spits] You motherfuckers. You use the word "crazy" but you don't have a clue what it means. They've been messing with my head since I was a teenager. They want me to think I'm fucking crazy. But I'm so tired of all this shit. - Calm down. - I'm so tired of you trying to force your vision of reality on me. Just... just leave me alone, okay? Just... just leave me alone. I'm not like all of them, okay? I'm not like all of them, I promise. Now put it down, okay? You can trust me, okay? Chloe, drop the bar. Okay? You can trust me. Chloe, put the bar down. Chloe, drop it, okay? What's the point of living if you can't trust what you see? [screams] [exhales] [picks up bar] - Why did you do that? - Why I did I do what? Well, I had the situation under control, but you made her panic. Are you serious? She was a psychopath. You thought she would put the screwdriver down just because you asked her to? - She was going to put it down. - You're so naive. Goddamn you. Chloe? Chloe? Chloe? "You will now ascend into heaven." "You will now ascend into heaven." There. Three piles of dust right there. You smart-asses. It's a triangle It's the trinity. [door creaks] Three different drills. Three extraction forceps. Three bottles. Three implants here. Pages 3 and 33 are dog-eared. Always the number 3. The sacrifice of one's own... [screams] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [breathing heavily continuous] [gasps and pants] Let me go, you fucking assholes! [breathing heavily] What are you going to do to me? Okay, okay. Please... [sobs softly] No. No. Okay... [breathing heavily] Fuck. - [loud snap] - [screams] [cries] [sobs] Please, no! [loud snap] [shrieks] Please. [screams] [drill whirs] No! No! [screaming] Chloe? Chloe, are you okay? Chloe, why are you covered in blood? - Chloe? - I tried to save him. He was still breathing when I got here. Jablowski? Holy shit! [Lucas breathing heavily] [Chloe] But I couldn't do anything. [Lucas] Chloe, what's happened? - The killer... - Chloe? ...he grabbed me before I could call you for help. Why did you disappear, Chloe? But I managed to escape. Okay, come on. Let's go, okay? Let's get out of here. It's just the two of us now. Find a way out of here, Chloe. Help me. Because there's still a killer on the loose, isn't there? [Chloe] The prize will be ours. Chloe, isn't there? Chloe? Tarot cards often hide biblical symbols. Well, this one's kind of biblical. Now this one has a bit of a biblical references. There's seven branches here, evenly spaced. You know, like the seven rungs of Jacob's Ladder? Chloe? Like the... seven degrees of initiation, you know? You know, what connected man from Earth to heaven... or hell? Do you see Jacob anywhere? That's Jacob. [grunts] Come on, time to see what's waiting for us at the top. Okay. Why have you stopped, Chloe? - Sorry. - What...? [both grunt] [bar clatters] [groaning] You fucking cunt! [grunting] Fucking cunt! [grunts] [keypad beeping] [groaning] You fucking... fucking bitch! Chloe! Chloe! No, no, no, no, no, no. Ah. Lucas, I'm cold. For Christ sake, what...? Okay. Ah... what happened? Lucas... Lucas. Lucas. Please forgive me. [both panting] No, no, stay with me. This place, it made me lose my mind. Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, stay... stay with me. No, you go. [in Lucas' mother's voice] Now, you're ready to face life. I love you, sweetheart. No, no, no, no, no. Chloe? Chloe? Chloe? [whimpers] [sobs] [cries] Come on, you fucking coward! Where are you? Come on! Come on! Come and face me. [panting] [growls] Come on, come and face me, you fucking coward. Come on, what are you waiting for? - [knife pierces] - [groans] [panting] [both grunt] [Lucas screams] Go ahead. Take it off. See how much of a monster you really are. Look at what you're capable of. [choked gasp] I've been hiding the truth from you for years now. It's time for you to take responsibility for your actions. You created Paranoia to lure Chloe into your trap. She'd been avoiding you for years now. Since she dumped you, actually. Shut up! You harassed her so much... she left you because you were so paranoid and violent. Chloe! [yells] Chloe! - [choked gasp] - Shut up! Shut up. It's what you really want, is it? It is what you really want? To forget about the monster and go on as before? To forget your conscience... Lucas? Back off. Lucas... I said back off. Huh? Because you're trying to drive me crazy, aren't you? That's what you're doing. Or at least trying to make me think I'm crazy. You're trying to make me use my frailty to believe I did something I wasn't even aware of. I know what I did and didn't do. Shut up! [sobs and screams] [panting] Mom, I can't do it. Keep trying, sweetheart. Don't give up. It's too difficult. You will make it. You're the best. You'll always be the best. Now, concentrate. I love you, Mom. I love you too, but you'll have to do much better. [door creaks] - [door locks bolt] - Mom? Come back! [breathing heavily] Help! Please, help! Help! Please. Help! Help! [police sirens wailing distantly] [police officer] Over here! Over here! You said you've seen a man with an orange uniform? What happened to your hand? It's an injury from when I was a child. Right, just wait a minute. [groans] [car door closes] [exhales] [screams] All right all right, calm down. You need to get some rest, okay? We're going to take you home. But don't leave town. I still have got some questions for you. Okay. [groaning] [laughs softly] [distant screaming] [shrieking] I know what I did and didn't do. So, uh, how did I kill my mother? Asleep? Back off! [classical music playing on record] I've been waiting for this moment to come. Now you're ready to face life. [breathing heavily] [knife slices] [music stops]
