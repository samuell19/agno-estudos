It's enough. There's a long way back home. Go now. I'll accompany you to the station. I don't like saying goodbye near the ticket booth. When I see you from behind, I'm drawn back to you. When I imagine you walking alone in the dark... I'm restless all the way. A little bit more... Forgive me... For what? You always have to wait. What are you talking about? You waited for me to return from the army for 3 years. I'm ready to wait however long it takes. Thank you. It's all because of me. We'll get married, sooner or later. Well, go now. We really enjoyed ourselves today... It was a great Sunday. Now go back and remember that I'm behind you. Just don't look back, alright? Good night. I can't. Let's go to the station. Mum, let me wash it. I'm done already. The water is cold. Let me do it. "How much longer can the poor sell their possessions to feed themselves?" Mum, it's as if it was about us. We'll be lucky to be able to go on like this. But we'll have nothing left to sell soon. What will we do then? It's tough for everyone nowadays. And nobody knows how much longer it's going to continue. But we don't have it that bad. We've managed to get by so far. If something happens, I can leave school. Everything's fine. No need to even think about it. We'll be able to find the means if need be, won't we, mum? There's no need for you to leave school. It was just a thought... It seems, Sugawara is going to be a part of our family soon. I'm sorry to bring this up. Sugawara is a good person. I like him too, he's like a brother to me. It would be great! It's been a year and a half since he came back from the army. And the engagement had been four and a half years ago. Fumie is dragging her feet, while we struggle to make ends meet. I think, Fumie should make up her mind as soon as possible. Of course... everything isn't so simple in this world. They should have got married before he joined the army. This way, sister would also have an income. I want to find a job myself. However hard you try, how much can you possibly earn? Sister, why are you saying that? I'll earn a lot. In that case, why not get a job in our company? We need a secretary. A secretary is not a job. You don't understand. I give great presentations in front of everyone. Squeaking in front of them like a mosquito? Ouch! It hurts! That's how mosquitoes bite. It hurt... What's taking father so long? He must be hungry. It's so windy outside. Why is it so cold? For now, only Fumie and you are working... But I also need to find a job. It's useless to even look for it. Even young people can't find a job. Yes, old people can't get a job in the office. Age. That's why father doesn't have a job either. The situation in Japan is sad. And the prices keep rising. What's going to happen next? Everyone who left school this year are unemployed. God... how many people still believe in the brighter future? I'm home. Welcome back. Father is here too. Dad, are you cold? It's freezing outside. I'm so cold. Glad to see you. Hello. Welcome. Thank you. So, everything seems to be alright with the job? Really? Yes? It's great. You know Shimamoto, don't you? The one who was your subordinate in the bureau? Exactly. I saw him today. How is he? Same as before? I hardly recognized him at first, he's got so fat. He has a lot of money, but his condition is poor. And what does he do? He runs a restaurant in Ginza. He bought me dinner. So I'm full. It's so cold. Have some soup, at least. Shimamoto also said he could help me out. It's very nice of him. I wonder what job he's going to offer me. I'll go see him again tomorrow. I see. Father, everything will be alright now. It's great, isn't it, sister? Now father will hearten up. I'm sorry that I've been loafing around up to now. Fumie! Everything is settled with a job now, so it's time for the wedding. I'll make some green tea. Wow! What a treatment! We have an occasion today, after all. Once Fumie is married, we'll feel better. She spent the whole day with Sugawara today. I, too, think only about that. Sister, what do you think? She's happy, of course. Where are you going? Stay. I'm home. Great. Welcome back. Sugawara, she's been waiting for you for a long time now. Really? Welcome back. - Have you been waiting long? - No, not at all. Thank you. I knew you would come. Really? Ouch! Sorry, did you get burnt? You did. No, you're faking it. It really hurts. I'll leave the tray here. Thank you. You came back so late, you must be starving? I am. I bought you some cutlets. And I bought tempura. You did? Must be delicious. Your cutlets also look good. Here. We've got so much food! Is it too much for you? Yes. Take half. No. Let's eat together. Alright. By the way, father managed to find a job. Really? He went to settle the details today. I see. That's a very tasty cutlet. The tempura is great as well. Have some more. Alright. Can we get married now? Sorry to disturb you. I'm sorry I didn't thank you immediately. I'm the one who should be apologizing. I keep disturbing you. Isn't it so, Fumie? I just wanted to offer you some potatoes. Thank you very much. I'm the one who should be grateful. Listen. Let's tell everyone. Alright? You don't want to? Sugawara, I'm still here. Make yourselves comfortable. Nevermind me, I'll leave now. No-no, auntie. It's just that we've decided to get married. Really? What are you going to give us as a wedding present? You have time to think. You're getting married? Finally. I guess so. Why 'I guess so'? It's soon now. Congratulations. Welcome! Come in! They call people like me 'a veteran in a dressing gown'. Who needs someone like me? Indeed... It was my lucky hour when I met you. If I'd carried on crunching numbers under your supervision... I don't know what I'd have become by now. I spent 30 years working as an accountant. And, during all that time, I didn't get a single figure wrong. But the company went bust, and I became a useless ronin. You're a very serious person indeed. Here's to you. I sincerely admire you. But now I'm out on the street... Not only you. Most people are unemployed now. The times have changed. Everything is different now. No one needs people like me. It's surprising that no one wanted you. And yet it's true. Indeed, we are like workhorses. We have to toil without stopping. I still have plenty of energy. I just need to adjust. Darling, you mentioned tuna that will be delivered in a couple of days... are you going to pay upfront? Yes, I should. It's 50 yen. Quite steep. Have some more to drink, you'll feel better. Would you like some entertainment? We're in a great mood already. Help yourself to some more. Bottoms up! Enough for me. Don't say that, please. When you don't have enough energy, you can get dizzy. If you agreed to help, it would be very useful for us. Wouldn't it, darling? Matsukawa is a very responsible person. Not so long ago, we had problems with people stealing from the till. You have to keep an eye on money all the time nowadays. Count once again. Ma'am, take the change. I'll be going. Have some rest. Feel at home. Thank you. The whole business hinges on her. What a wonderful woman! Not at all. But since we got together, it's no good getting divorced now. - Thank you very much. - We're very grateful. But it's a very big business. Thank you. What kind of people come here? Great people. Ordinary people can't afford it. There must be only profiteers here? Everyone speculates nowadays. It's not true. I don't, for example. Exactly. That's why you have nothing to eat. The ones who lead a normal life now, usually end up kicking the bucket. What's going to become of this world then? We'll know later. Meanwhile, you can't survive otherwise. But we're not animals, we mustn't think only about feeding ourselves. Such theories are no good for our times. I'm ready to live an honest life, but who's going to provide for me then? You are... we all are, with our own hands, little by little. Now I recognize the real Matsukawa and I take off my hat to you. Are you teasing me? No, I'm serious. But people who think like you... are non-existent in the modern world. Why is that? If we start discussing why, we'll end up having an argument. I consider my convictions right. Let's not talk about this anymore. No, I won't give in. You have to take your words back. You're getting richer and richer every day, and you lead a calm life. But what you're doing is called... You wanted to say 'profiteering'? No. It's an honest business, no doubt. You've got too excited. You need a cold shower. You should go get some air. Whether I take a shower or not, it's not going to change my point of view. Let's discuss it some other time. What 'other time'? It's a sensitive subject. Because even if I do something wrong, it's only in order to survive. I'm not saying you're doing something bad, but you have to live an honest life. Matsukawa, it's enough. Let's drink instead. No, have a look here... See this crab, this eel? Or, this sashimi... what's all this? Can you say that you live and conduct your business honestly? Why are you so worked up? - Bring some more saké. - Coming right up. All these viands, do you need them to survive? In my home... nobody has seen anything like this for a year. People can't feed themselves, while profiteers are getting fatter and fatter. Where is justice? Why are you telling me all this? It was you who started this conversation. 'The evil is thriving, while the good is waning' - is that what you wanted to say? Matsukawa, it's enough. I understood you very well. But is it alright to deceive? One mustn't deceive! Have some more to drink, please. Nothing's going to change if I drink more. In any case, I'm ready to offer you a job. Come work for me, please. You don't have to do anything bad. You can start tomorrow. It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong. If you don't accept, you won't have anything to live on. No one cares how you make your living. Desperate times, desperate measures. There are five or six of you in your family. And I'm that poor person who you used to take care of. Let me repay you for your kindness. Plus, you'll have an income. Let's drink while it's hot. What's gotten into you? Where are you going? I'm leaving. Don't, Matsukawa! Come back, please! Don't be mad! Goodbye. I was wrong about you. Matsukawa! You're leaving already? Give me some water. Just a moment. Are you going to have dinner? Yes. What do you have? What happened? I turned down the job. I want to go to sleep. Make the bed for me. Are you upset about something? This Shimamoto deceived me. I'm home. Is father back already? It didn't work out. I see. Welcome back. Why aren't you sitting near the stove? Our father is a fool. Why? He turned down the job. Try to understand him. It means he didn't like something. Because he is a fool. Kei! Sister, do you want to have dinner? I ate together with Tsumoru. What about father? He went to bed. Kei, you're going to catch a cold! Go to bed too. What's wrong? It's got even colder today. You should go to bed too. Father, are you sleeping? Yes... Father, there's no hurry. Nothing bad happened. I understand that you want it to be quick, but it's not worth it. Good night. I'm home. Your sister from Kyushu is here. Really? Hello! I haven't seen you for ages! How are you? I'm fine, as you can see. What about you? Well... mum can't get out of bed sometimes. She's old. That's why I've come. Here's a present for you. Thank you. Is everything that bad? I didn't mean that. Let's talk about it later. No, I'm ready to listen now. It's about your future wife. What about her? It's not funny. Mum wants to see her. She just wants her younger son to finally settle down. And that's why you've come here from Kyushu so urgently? It was so crowded on the train. I'm so tired. Go get some sleep. I'd rather keep talking to you. There's nothing to worry about. Everything's fine. I'm not worried. Mum is. Let's eat. I've eaten already. There's a nice girl in our village. Do you want to have a look? I have a picture. I have some onigiri left. Want some? Yes. Here she is. She's pretty, isn't she? She's very kind too. Mum made it herself yesterday morning. I thought so. I recognized her form. Oh, yes. Here's something else. She gave you 500 yen for 'personal expenses'. - Is it from mum? - Yes. Thank you. So how do you find her? Sister, you know everything, don't you? About your Fumie? Yes. Mum knows about her as well. But you're very unlikely to ever be together. And this girl is nice, and it could work out between the two of you. You mustn't worry about that. We just want what's best for you. Mum is old now. She'll feel better like this. Father, Shimamoto wants to talk to you. Who's here? It's Shimamoto. Father doesn't want to see him. It's useless. You've come all this way... and you couldn't see him. I'm really sorry. Please, don't think that everyone here shares the same opinion. It's OK. I also said something I shouldn't have. It's a sensitive subject and I should have been more careful. I have nothing to repay you with for your kindness. He's always been like that... if he gets something into his head, he won't budge. We've all had a lot of trouble because of that. Other people can be reasonable and tractable... but he will never bow or conform. And then I always end up apologizing to neighbors and relatives. Although they understand that it's just the kind of temper he has. We've been together for a long time, and I think he's a good man. I worked with him for a long time too, and I know him well. It's all because of my big mouth. The thing is, I want to open another joint. I desperately need help. Well... Ma'am... Thank you for your gift. No, thank you. Sorry for the intrusion. Forgive us, please. It's nothing. Let's eat? Darling, we're going to eat. What is it? It's a present from Shimamoto. Why these tears? I'm sorry... He came all this way to see you. You should have talked to him. Father! Why are you so stubborn? Kei! No, I'll say it. You were offered a job in a restaurant. Why do you have such an unbearable temper? You mustn't talk to parents like that! Stop it. Maybe, father doesn't want to eat... but we were lucky to get some eel, and I want mum to be happy. Mum works hard everyday. Why can't we eat well for once? I owe everyone so much for being able to go to school. But now I'll have to leave school. Everyone takes care of you. You mustn't think that. Yes, but because of that, you can't get married. Mum sold your kimono today. I know. Dad... Kei, apologize to father. Who raised us? Who took care of us? Father is old, he could have retired by now. But, because of us, he's looking for a job. Apologize to him. Don't be mad at him. I'm sorry. Father! Father! You'll catch a cold. Let's go home. Let's eat something hot? What? Let's go. No. I'll pay. It's for you. Welcome. Two bowls of soup. Coming right up. It's freezing today. You're cold... Here you go. Here, father. Here you go. He's fast asleep. He came home early and went to bed. Parents are glad to see that. We have to get off soon. Alright. Great! Finally. If you came to see mum, it'd be wonderful. We will. We started looking for a young girl... who could become Tsumoru's wife. But, it turns out, it was a silly idea. Life goes so fast. Besides, there are so few pleasures in it. But I'm happy that I've come and met you. Maybe it's selfish, but I'm very grateful to you. Me too. This and this. She's a nice girl. But if the situation doesn't change, you'll have problems. Still, try to come to the village. Here, you can read it on the train. Thank you very much. And now... how about a little walk? Yes. Worker, your time has come! Society against work 24/7! We have tolerated exploitation for too long. The poor, rise! Now, we're going to lead a class struggle 24/7 True workers, keep your heads up! Our lives were taken away from us... but we're going to restore justice with our own hands! The flag of freedom is flying in front of our column May it protect workers on May Day, 1! How about some tea? Let's eat something, maybe? Again? Let's spend mum's last money on tempura? - Is it tasty? - Yes. Some saké? Why not? - Waitress! Bring some saké. - Coming right up. One bottle, please. It's expensive. Do you have the money? Don't worry. I have some too. No! - About 200 yen. - I have enough. - Take it... - No. Take it. Drink some too. With pleasure. Well? It's tasty. Some more? Drink some more. But... Why not? Well, alright. I feel dizzy. Your eyelids are red. Really? Yours are not. Not yet. You're so strong. Let's get drunk? Alright. I'll keep an eye on you. We'll tell the whole truth. Alright. You're lying. Do you want to see me drunk? Yes. It's thumping so hard... It's so nice to drink saké, isn't it? It's fun. Am I red in the face? A little bit. You too. Am I red? Are you afraid of becoming weak? Since you surprised me... we'll have a night of entertainment tonight. What happened? How old is your mum? Well... 67 or 68. You don't know how old your parents are exactly? I'm probably not a very good son. That girl in your native village. It seems, she'll make a good wife. My sister told you? What if you marry her? Yes, if I don't like you anymore, I might do that. No, really. She's better. She's not. But, maybe, for others... And for me? I... Drink some more. Come on. It seems, we won't be able to get married. It's just saké. I'm drunk, and so are you. I'm not joking. I really want to be with you. Drink some more. Why don't we dance? But you can't dance. I'll just look. I don't want to go without you. I'll be with you. I'll be looking at you. Alright. The spring has come, but the blossoms have fallen off The clouds are drifting away and returning... Why can't I get over this painful feeling? Everything is futile! Woman's love comes one day The night wind is rocking the red brooch I'm whispering your name again... Why haven't you come? Tears are rolling down my face Everything is futile Woman's love comes one day Well? Did you like it? You have to dance too. I will. Will you? I'll hold on to you and follow you. You have to walk to music, starting with the right foot: one, two, three... No, not like that. Backwards. Fumie! What's wrong? We have to break up. I can't be with you anymore. Forgive me. You need a good wife. The one you can marry anytime. I made up my mind. Everyone is suffering because of me. I'm miserable... Trust me, please. What do you say? Well? I'll wait as long as necessary. No. Don't say that. Even if we grow old like this, I don't care. If we break off our engagement... it'll be better for everyone. You can do as you please. But it's not going to change my willingness to wait. So you won't be able to love anyone else your whole life because of me? It's so scary that you can't love anyone else. And during the war, among bullets and fire... you waited... You waited all the time... and, finally, you returned. And now all that is futile... It's saké. You're drunk, and now you're crying. No, you're wrong. The more I see you, the more it hurts. You need some rest. Let's go home. No. We have to say goodbye. OK. See you tomorrow. No. Tomorrow I'm going to say the same thing. And the day after tomorrow. OK, then we'll meet every day... I can't take another day. Everyone has to think only about me. You're neurotic. Why do you say that? Let's go home. Are you taking the bus? I'll accompany you. No, I'll go by myself. And you, go home. And don't you dare look back. You can go alone, just don't fall in the pit. Goodbye. When you come home, pour cold water over your head. Welcome back. Good evening. Fumie... Father has been unwell since this morning. Is he in bed? Is he bad? Not that bad. But he's coughing all the time. What's wrong with you? How are you feeling? It's alright. I just have a cough, nothing to worry about. I hope so. Father, you have weak bronchi, you have to take care of yourself. I'm old. You know, Fumie, I had a strange dream recently. What dream? Do you remember... how 5 or 6 years ago I was transferred from Hiroshima to the Head Office? Yes, you went to Kyoto then. Yes, one day we went to Arashiyama. I saw it in my dream. Really? As if we were going back by train. First, I put mum and you on the train. Then we started to beg the ticket collector... You cried so much. But it was useless... You, children, mum and me - we were all young, like in the old days. Fumie, are you hungry? I'm coming. Have some rest. And get well soon. There's nothing left. I don't want anything. But... Don't worry. Are you well? Yes... and where's Kimiko? There's a meeting today, she'll be home late. Keiji went with her? He doesn't like it when there are only women around. Fukiko, you forgot to turn off the light. Just a moment. I'm home. Mum, I'll get a ration of rice tomorrow. That's good. For whole 10 days! Great, isn't it? Yes. And timely too. I was going to borrow some. You've become thinner. That will do me good. It's all my build. No, you have to gain some weight. Can I come in? Sugawara, it's you? Welcome. You're not in bed yet? Not yet, come in. Mum, Sugawara is here. Go upstairs, please. Fumie is there. No, I'm in a hurry. I've come here in the middle of the night because I have a request. Sister, Sugawara is here. I said goodbye to Fumie, and when I returned to my place, I found a telegram from home. My mother is dying. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. Mum is very worried because of me. If it's possible, I'd like Fumie to come with me. That's why I've come. There can be different circumstances, but I need an answer now. In any case, I'd like Fumie to come with me. Mum wanted to see her at least once. Please, I have to go get the tickets immediately. Talk to her father and ask his permission. I'm leaving from the Tokyo railway station tomorrow at 8. I'll talk to him, but... I'm sorry for such a late visit. His mother is dying. He said he's leaving tomorrow morning. Since he's asking, why don't you go with him? Mum, I wanted to break up with Sugawara. What are you talking about? Sugawara has a bride in his native village. Why haven't you told us anything before? I don't care. What do you mean you don't care? Listen, Fumie, why do you want to break off the engagement? I hoped Sugawara and you would get married. I was looking forward to it. When I think about marriage, I don't need anyone except Sugawara. But if I keep talking about wanting to get married... it will bring father nothing but suffering. I... I understand what I have to do. Isn't it true, mum? Mum... mum... Mum... father is calling you. Did you want something? Will you call Fumie? I want to talk to her. I'm here. It's you, Kimiko? Yes. Will you turn on the light? Fumie, you have to go to Kyushu with Sugawara. You have to meet his mother. Don't worry about us. Get married. I was wrong when I got angry. I have to accept social rules. If you don't do it, you can never achieve success. It's useless to just be indignant. You have to fight. How should one live in today's world? One has to dedicate oneself to work. Father, I'm sorry for what I said. I was wrong to be so stubborn. Fumie, you have to go to Sugawara immediately. Today is your wedding. Since we don't really have many things, take a suitcase for now. Dad! Let this trip to Kyushu be your honeymoon. Come on, get ready. Right. Kimiko, help your sister. Sister, let's go. Do we still have saké tickets? We should get some. If not, we should borrow. Alright. What will you take with you? Don't just sit there. Sister, you have to be happy! Take this scarf. Thank you. Congratulations. Sister, I also have a gift for you. Here, take it. Thank you. Congratulations. Mum, give me a fresh towel. Just a moment. Mum, give me a new bar of soap. Yes, of course. Fumie, to you! Dad, forgive me. You've always been a good daughter. Mum... Be a good wife. Oh! It's snowing... Snow before Fumie's wedding is a good sign. Fumie, be healthy and love each other. Mum, I'm sorry I think only about myself. Why cry on such a great day? I'll be going. It's time. Be happy! Give greetings to my brother! THE END
