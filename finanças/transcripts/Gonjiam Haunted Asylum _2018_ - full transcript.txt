No identification with actually persons, companies, and organizations is intendee or should be inferred. Finally, the 4th floor. I'm freaking nervous! What the hell! So scared. That's scary... Don't play around! You little chicken. 402... Isn't this it? 402? It really exists. This shit is heavy. Hey, Hae-chan. You said we wouldn't come. But we're right in front of room 402. You see? 402! We're not chicken like you. We're real men! Now we'll unlock it and leave. You thought we cannot make it. But we made it! We're real men, you sucker! We're opening the door! Hold this for me. We're doing it for real! But it doesn't go through. Stop acting! It's not opening. I don't know how... Total wuss. - What was that? - What? Wait. Hello, everyone. You must've seen this on Youtube. The high schoolers who went missing at Gonjiam. So what should I do? I checked whether the clip was fabricated. Ta-da! Two high school students went missing on their horror experience That's real. And the ghost picture doesn't seem fake. So! Our next stop for Horror Times' 3rd horror experience squad is... one of three most haunted houses in Korea and one of 7 freakiest places on earth selected by CNN! Namyoung Psychiatric Hospital. Since it opened in May 1961 it was the best mental hospital in Korea but it closed in October 1979 after a mass suicide of patients and the disappearance of its director. The building still stands, yet abandoned. Gonjiam asylum, folks! Footages! No. 1026 The 1 1th 5. 16 citizens award ceremony was hele at the Blue House. The grand prize goes to Park Young-ae the director of Namyoung Psychiatric Hospital recognizing her achievement for treating not only mental patients, but also political prisoners ane brutal criminals. There are numerous rumors around Gonjiam asylum. Some say it was built on the place where the Japanese brutally murdered and buried the Korean resistance so that nobody could trace the bodies. Or it was the national torturing facility in the 60s and 70s disguised as asylum or that the mass suicide was actually murders by the director who then killed herself, not went missing. So there are countless reports of ghost sightings and hearings of wailing after the closure of the asylum. The biggest rumor among all is about room 402, the only locked space of the asylum. They say whoever dares to open that room is cursed to death. So we, the Horror Times are going into the Gonjiam asylum, on October 26th the day it closed, to investigate the truth about supernatural phenomena and the ghosts many people witnessed. Care to join? I'm at the terrace of a cafe at Gangnam. Guess I'm the first one. Let me wait for others to come. - For Horror Times? - Yes. Hello. - Are you filming me? - Yes. Yes, my family is in the States and I'm here with my dance crew. - Wow. - Awesome. - What do you do? - Studying nursing... - Boys must like you! - I'm at a women's univ. Isn't he the one? Here they are! Hello, everyone. Hello. - Nice to see you. - Hello. Let's do some introduction. Sure! These are the selected applicants Oh Ah-yeon, Park Ji-hyun and... - Charlotte! - Charlotte Moon. And from Horror Times, Lee Seung-wook, Park Sung-hun. - Hello. - Hello. Seung-wook will do MC and Sung-hun will operate the 1st camera. And you know who I am? Ha-joon, the captain of the squad. - It's like a group date. - Right. - Didn't mean it... - Just stop talking. Seems like one is missing. - As if you saw a ghost... - Isn't he? I guess so. - Shall we call him? - Here! - Here! - Come here! Yes, please come here! Here he comes! Hello, you're here for Horror Times? - Hello! - Sorry, I was lost nearby. Je-yoon will do editing and graphic effects. Ji-hyun, 2nd camera. And one go pro camera per two. Please memorize the floor plan and the cue-sheet. What are you doing? It's for the fuck-you-mentary. - Cheers! - Bottoms up! - Nice to meet you! - Cheers! Where have you been to among CNN's 7 freakiest places? Sedlec Ossuary in Czech, the Island of the Dolls in Mexico, and Aokigahara Forest in Japan. I've been to three places. Everyone who's seen the ghost at Gonjiam heard some sound first. - You mean a ping pong ball? - You're right. People who saw the ghosts there heard a ping pong ball. But why that specific sound? Actually there is a ping pong table. Broken in half. Can't it be the echoed sound of water drops? But why did the director kill all her patients? There's no proof she killed them. People say that as all the patients died and the director went missing. Rumor also says she hung herself at the hospital's bathroom. Her neck apparently was stretched a foot long. Gross... Are you scared? Me? No. - You seem to be. - No way! Whose idea is it to air this live? A car racing club uploaded the clip of their wild speed racing on their website a while ago. It reached 200K views and earned more than 100K for ads. - 100K dollars? - Yes. Can you earn money airing this kind of stuff? Hell yes... I guess you are a kind of student who learns everything by the book... Never breaks rules. She's cute. Yes, very cute but... learning everything by the book. Not by experiences... How many views are you expecting? - A million! - A million? I am aiming for that. - Heavy. - Do you mean a million? It means we'll earn 500K as it's 5 times of 200K views? Captain. I really think we should send her home. Why? - Ready? - Sure. - Wow! - Oh my god! - Did he catch it? - I can't believe it! He caught it! Unbelievable! - He got it! Right? - Let me see! Impossible! How you do that? Hurry! Just throw it! Shoot it! Hey! Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. I think we really should send her home. - You come here. - Please... - For million views! - Million views! Cheers! No one saw the director ghost. Don't you think her spirit should be there, too? You're right. But people only saw the patients and a high school girl. Patients I get it. But why a high school girl? About 30 years ago? Three high school girls went there to test their nerves and were found unconscious while trying to open room 402. They were immediately sent to the hospital. Two of them went insane and jumped to their deaths. The other one remained unconscious. That's what I heard. That's why there's a romor That the room 402 is cursed. What's our plan for room 402 then? The climax of this experience will be opening the door. What? You never mentioned that. Great! It's more fun to know by surprise. We're opening it! Yeah! Not all of us are coming in? Why? Are you scared? Hell, no! You're really good at joking. Seriously, who is opening that door? Guys ready? Let's do this! Go, go, go! - No! - Pass me, please! No, hell no! You've got it! Wait, wait. - Go Je-yoon, go Je-yoon! - I can't accept it. - Someone manipulated it. - What is he saying? Horror Times don't do such thing! Something's wrong with it. Are you scared? I can go with you. You take care of yourself. Why is he shaking? He's relieved. He sees us! Wait for me! Wait! Yeah come on! Let's go now. Impressive - Can that follow us? - Of course! We can't get in anyway if we get there early. Let's have some fun. You mean going for a dip like previous horror experience? It's almost November. You've reached the eestination. There. That's the entrance all barricaded. They blocked it! - We can't get in through here. - Then how can we go through? We'll get in from the back. Police patrol here even at night. - Really? - Yes. Look at that. This car can get in? It's heavy. It's scary here. - We're here. - Let's get out. Finally! - It must be heavy. - You're not helping? Hey, look at the camera. This way. We are going all the way to the top? Yes. The hospital is right in front of us. Why should we climb this hill? There are surveillance cameras. I have a headache. Can't you see these? Why you wearing heals? Je-yoon, come on! Hey, hurry up! Je-yoon! Are you okay? Is this a horror club or an extreme sports club? A drone camera is following us from above. Hello! - Help me with this. - What? So cozy. It is 9:25 PM. Sung-hun and Seung-wook are out to Gonjiam Asylum for installing CCTV inside. Wish they wouldn't encounter the ghosts too early. We have ghosts here, too. My hat! The camera is on. O.K, they're inside. Sung-hun, right there. Okay with angles and positions. Wow, it's no joke. The camera moved automatically just now. This is a follow cam. The camera follows movement. Everything is new to you, kiddo. - She's so cute. - We should send her home. Sung-hun! Seung-wook! Good job! It's freezing when it gets dark. Hurry. The tent is warm. How was Gonjiam? It's there... Good job. Did you see the ghost? They are not there yet. I'm so hungry. - Good job. - Really. I'm starving. We should eat something. - Sweetie! - I'm making noodles now. Good girl. You're smart in that sense. - You're making it now? - Yes. - Let's eat. - It's done. - Tuck in. - Do we have a ladle? It's good - Are you okay? - Water? Water, please. Are you okay? No, I'm not. - Wow, GoPro sessions! - Dope! - So many of them! - Are we bringing them all in? Of course. What is this? Electro-magnetic field meter - What's it in Korean? - A ghost detector. An electro-magnetic field tester to be exact. The special magnetic field flows where psychotic flow occurs. So people use this to detect spirits. We usually call this EMF meter. It fits there. I'm fixing it in case you take it off when you get too scared. You can only release it here. It makes me more nervous. Tighter, tighter! Tighter. Yes, tighter! With this, you can record your face and your POV at the same time. See? Dope! - Cool? - Yes. So it's almost working hours for the ghosts. Everyone must be nervous. Shall we head down? Go, go, go, go, go. Let's go! - Yes! - Let's Go! Check Ah-yeon's face cam and Je-yoon's POV cam. I don't receive them. And now? It's okay. Sound check. Say your name. Sung-hun. Seung-wook. Charlotte. Ji-hyun. Je-yoon! Ah-yeon. Sound check eone. Hey. I already feel a chill. - Something might come out. - Right? Shall we use the EMF? Already? We're not even near the entrance. Why, why? - Something just passed. - I heard a flap. - Was it a bird? - Bird? That freaked me out. Damn it. Be still, my heart. It's just it came out so suddenly. I'm not afraid of anything. You look so chicken-hearted. No. - You're lying. - I'm not! Don't lie. Why are you laughing? What's this? What the fuck. What? - What is it? - What is it? Tell us! Don't touch it. What happened exactly? Leave it there. We can use it as a mark. - Right. - Good idea. Someone's underwear as a mark... Zoom in 12,000 VIEWS We've passed 12,000 views. We'll start to air in 5 mins. Careful. Be careful. Watch your steps. Why you wearing heals? - Whew. - Be careful! Ji-hyun, okay? Watch out! Shhh, give me your hand, Ah-yeon. It's slippery here. Watch out, Charlotte. Thank you. Look there. Dope. Damn it. So the top floor is the 4th? Yes, the basement is the first floor here. Where is room 402? I can't tell from outside. Rumor says if you take a shit there, you can make it big. You should've told me earlier! I already took a shit! Damn it. Let's go! Hurry. Why? Turn off your lights, everyone! Cover LED lights! - Cover them. - Why? - It's not the patrol time. - Shhh.. Is it a cop? Be quiet and wait. Are they gone? This place is crazy. What are you doing, Ji-hyun? - Come here. - I'm coming. - Let's move together. - It's so scary. I'm scared. Look! This is the main entrance leading to the 2nd floor. Let's get in. Go ahead. Wait for me. It's scary. Aren't you coming? Need to shoot from behind. Okay. Wanna leak. I'm shooting. You go ahead. I'll shoot from behind. Got it. - Shall we go on? - Yes. Crap, what shall I do? Is it for real? It's really terrifying. What's written on it? 'Enter and you will die.' And 'Fuck it', afterwards... Time to start airing. Hey, gather here. We're starting! Okay! Stand by. Three, Two, One. Go! We, Horror Times' horror experience squad managed to sneak into the prohibited Gonjiam asylum. Today is Oct. 26th. And it just passed midnight. We can already get the chill in this building where the spirits are said to appear midnight. Korea's first live horror show ever! Gonjiam horror experience begins now! Very good opening, Seung-wook. VR first and get in! - Hurry, hurry! - Let's go! Music! - Enter. - Enter. Seung-wook, stane by. Go! It is four past midnight. We're finally inside of Gonjiam asylum. Here's the lobby on the 2nd floor. Someone's living here... I can get the chill... You always get the chill. What do you want me to get? Chocked? Hang on. Here's the hallway on the 2nd floor. The rooms are lined on both sides. There are lots of garbage on the floor. We're approaching the reception desk. Ji-hyun and Charlotte, you go ahead. Where is it? It's here. Here. Ji-hyun, your line. Go! Charlotte pours holy water she took from Myung-dong Cathedral into a bowl. We're going to put a camera and capture ghosts. Seung-wook, your line. We already set up the high-tech equipments at the spots of supernatural phenomena and ghost appearance. Let me brief you the rundown of... Damn! What is it? Where? Where is it? Was it the director's room? It closed by itself. Didn't it? This is real, everyone. The door of the director's room got closed by itself. We will go and check. I'm horrified. DIRECTOR'S ROOM We're now in the director's room. Might be a coincidence but the door got closed by itself just before. It's the phenomenon many people who came here witnessed. Look at this! - What? - Come here, hurry! Sung-hun, zoom in the picture. Seung-wook, your line Seems like a group photo of the patients and hospital crews. It looks like an ordinary group photo but if you take a closer look, something is off. - All staring at... - Different directions... And the woman in the center seems to be the director who is rumored to kill all the patients and disappear. - She looks creepy. - I agree. We found other pictures. Director getting the award. Her playing ping pong. Guess this lady was fond of the sport. That can explain the sound of ping pong ball. Stop it! You scare me! What is it? Over there... Wow... It reads 'The people who read.' Seems like people read some books then. - From President Park Jung-hee. - That's a surprise! By the way, who's Park Jung-hee? Ex-president. Ex-president, Father of the very former one. Was her father a president, too? Hey, Charlotte... What the hell? - I was so surprised... - This really freaks out. Is that hair? - Not a person? - No. Let's wrap it up. Luckily we've found some pictures and shown them to you. I and Sung-hun are going to prepare the mediumistic ritual in this room to bring out the revengeful spirits of the patients who were unfairly killed. Meanwhile, other members will introduce you the horror spots on the 1st, 3rd and 4th floors. Everything will be live, of course. O.K! Everyone, move to the spots and stand by While I'm playing the replay. For supernatural phenomena and ghosts' appearance. Let me brief you the rundown of... Let me brief you the rundown of... Charlotte and Ji-hyun on the 1st floor, ready? Yeap! Time for the horror spots. Ready, go! I am on the 1st floor now. And Charlotte who'd already experienced 3 among CNN's 7 freakiest places is leaving her signature to celebrate her 4th experience. Charlotte? Hello, everyone! After Sedlec Ossuary in Czech, Aokigahara Forest in Japan. And the Island of the Dolls in Mexico, among CNN's 7 freakiest places, I, Charlotte finally arrived at Gonjiam asylum! I left my signature as a token just like the other places. And I can see someone wrote 'Let's live' here. Oh, Scary Move to the corridor. Someone lives here, it says. What? No, it says it's ghosts living here. Damn. Ghosts live here, everyone. And we are at the place where ghosts live. And there are weird writings on the wall. Ji-hyun. Look at this. Why is this turning off? LABORATARY This is the lab, everyone. Let's get in. What the heck? The inside seems like the lab. There is water on the floor. The water is leaking. Numerous medical charts scattered on the floor. Burnt trace on the wall, too. Cabinets are collapsed on the floor. Here is the laboratory. There are tiles on the walls, and most of them are shattered as if the room was bombed. On the floor, there are lVs, needles... and a microscope. Also there are lots of medicine bottles. And a doll, too. Ji-hyun, look here! It's the spot my friend took the psychic picture. Check it out. Here's the spot where my friend took the picture when she came here last year. - Are you watching now? - It was real. Point the camera at me. Are you okay? - What is it? - What the fuck! - What is that smell? - Fuck... Is that a chicken? Let's go out. We will leave here first. Good job, you two. Move to the 4th floor. Je-yoon and Ah-yeon on the 3rd floor. Stand by and go! Welcome back. Ah-yeon and I are in the hallway of the 3rd floor. We are only one floor upper but it feels colder here. We will check the temperature. Ah-yeon? It's 13 Celsius. 13 Celsius. It's 13 Celsius on the 3rd floor. What about the 2nd floor earlier? 13 Celsius. The temperature is the same. But there's a thing called sensory temperature. The sensory temperature I feel on the 3rd floor right now is about minus 13 Celsius. - There's a ping pong table! - What? There really is a ping-ping table as rumor says it. There's a dead bird. Je-yoon, calm down a bit. Okay. What now? Introduction of the 3rd floor! Right, we'll now show you the rooms on the 3rd floor. You must know well too, umm, people who've been here often said they witnessed supernatural phenomena on the 1st and 2nd floors and actual ghosts here on this floor and the 4th floor. They are said to be haunted spirits of patients wrongly killed. We will now... check out these rooms. What the... Je-yoon, your line. Alright. This is the shower room where the ghosts were seen many times. You can see on that wall inside an old stain in shape of a person. You can see on that wall inside It does look like a person. That is a so-called 'ghost spot'. That we don't want to believe... Anyway we, horror experience squad, installed this follow cam and a go pro on this highest spot to confirm the existence of the ghost. Now we're finally going further into the bathing room. Here we are. There! That! What is it? What's that? Damn it! What is it? Holy... It's a wig. Shit, put that away! It's so freaking scary! Put it away. I said put that away! Don't do that! Don't! Damn it! Don't do it! I warned you! - You damn... - Why is it here? Somebody must've left it for a joke. Don't do that! I warned you! I'm serious! You think I'm kidding? That's it for the 3rd floor... Ji-hyun and Charlotte on the 4th, stand by. Action! I'm in the hallway of the 4th floor where one of top two ghost spots along with the shower room. Here are our state-of-the-art equipment to trace the ghosts. The ceiling is equipped with 6 flash lights with infrared censor responding to a slightest movement and the minimum energy. We will now only have to wait until the ghost is spotted. Now to Ji-hyun. This is the climax of horror experience, the infamous room 402 where no one has been in since the closure of the hospital. The room used to be the intensive care room So many people challenging Gonjiam asylum tried to open this door which has been closed for so long. But every single one of them failed and were said to either have committed strange suicides, fallen in comas or died in accidents. So people started to call it as the curse of room 402. We tried to see with our eyes if it never opens. No, I can't open it. Did you all see it? The door is closed as a solid rock. But! Later, we'll be the first ones to open and shoot inside of room 402. We'll get to the bottom of the mystery of this room. Coming soon. Okay, great! 55,000 views COLLECTIVE CARE ROOM 1ST FLOOR CORRIDOR, 2ND FLOOR SUPPLY ROOM, 3RD FLOOR SHOWER ROOM, 3RD FLOOR BATHING ROOM, 3RD FLOOR HALLWAY, 4TH FLOOR You will wait here until I finish shooting the intro and follow me while I go around the room. Make sure to shoot at your positions in any cases during the ritual. Okay. Let's begin the ritual. Music is... on. Seung-wook, your turn. Now I am in the director's room the place for our mediumistic ritual. Can you see these? The red strings attached with small bells are hanging like a spider web. Amulet, millet, and cinnabar are prepared on the table for the ritual. Now! We will perform the dangerous ritual to call out the ghosts. I'd leave this room this minute if it were not for the live broadcasting. I'm that much scared and nervous, but! We will keep our promise to broadcast this ritual all live. Ah-yeon, the youngest member, will conduct the ritual. Ah-yeon, let's begin. She puts light on the incense and burns the amulet filled with spell calling out the haunted spirits. A monk at Bomoon Temple generously offered us the amulet. Get up and put your hands together. Now we will sit together and wait to see what happens... The candle light is flickering. What is it? Gosh! What the heck? What is it? - Damn it! - What the fuck is it? What? What? What's going on? To where! Did you all see the surveillance camera turned? It is not a joke! The rumors were all true! Did you all shoot it? I missed it completely. This place is of another level. Don't scare me. Comment, Seung-wook! Put everyone in the frame, Sung-hun. Stand by, go! Did you all see that? I still can't believe my own eyes. The place is closed off from outside. But soon after the ritual began the candle, the bells and the camera moved by itself. As if someone's not happy about our challenge. But we promise you that we'll finish our mission whatever risk lies ahead of us. Don't go anywhere. Okay! Move to the next spot. I'll air the replay. She puts light on the incense... - Yes, captain. - They didn't notice, did they? No, they absolutely freaked out. Did it look real? Sure. It rocked! What is the number now? 100K views! - 100K, really? - Unbelievable! We've got the good start, so we need to do it right to reach 1 million views. Double-check the settings upstairs and lead their reactions. Got it! I think Charlotte's reactions are killing it. I'll try to incite her more. Good. Make sure that they'd not find out. Even a ghost cannot. Gotta go. Shit. What the hell! You're kidding me? What... Comm on. Perfect. Perfect timing. What now? So we are now in the lab on the 1st floor after the ritual. We're a bit eased but like all of you watching online we still can't figure out how to explain what's just happened. Anyway we'll stick to our plan and go into the lab. Well... The entire room smells weird. This is the lab? It's further inside. Isn't it dope? This is the inside of the lab. That's the stench. I broke a glass bottle before. On the floor, left side. Can you see? Something like a dead chicken. That's what stinks. Hold on. Why is there a doll in the lab room? Are you kidding? It wasn't there before. Right, Ji-hyun? It was in the cabinet, not there. What? The doll was in the cabinet! Zoom in onto the doll, Sung-hun. Looks like the eoll in the picture. A patient was holding it. Shit! No way. Is someone else here? What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't touch it. No!!! Don't touch it! Put it back! Put it down! Lee Seung-wook! Hey, put it down now! Right now! Put it down! Shoot this, quick! Can't you just put it down? Charlotte! Je-yoon, follow her. Captain, check it out! It is the same doll. Captain said it's the same one. Why is he touching it? Charlotte, calm down. You just can't randomly touch things in places like this. Ji-hyun! You saw it too. The doll was in the cabinet! Are we the only people in here? I will put the picture on screen, your comment, Seung-wook. Stand by, go! You see this doll I'm holding? Don't be shocked. This doll which Charlotte claims was in the cabinet is the doll from the picture in the director's room where we performed the ritual. Please compare them. Why has this doll shown up and has it moved itself? Is there really a supernatural energy in this place? Strange things keep happening here. It's all real and you're watching all live! Good, we'll be back soon... You're fucking natural born actors! I can't stay here. - Charlotte, how can we leave? - I want to leave. This is really weird. - We can't just leave. - Yeah, Charlotte. Stop shooting, Ah-yeon. - I'm sorry, Charlotte. - You too, stop shooting! Lee Seung-wook! You never touch things in places like this! They're cursed! You can be in a serious trouble! Sorry. I just wanted to check as I couldn't believe my eyes. Damn it... We should give her some time... It's more dangerous to be on her own. Let's just finish what we were doing and get out of here, okay? Do you all hear me? If everyone wants to quit here, I will follow your decision. Then all we have done so far would turn into nothing. Let's hang in there a bit, shall we? Wrap this up as safely as possible just as Charlotte said. Yes, we are here together, so let's finish this together. Okay then. Hey, you never do anything risky! Yes, ma'am. I won't touch a thing! - I am so sorry. - Never! I mean it. Alright, I got it. I mean it. It's a break. Let's move to the next spot and stand by. Je-yoon and Ah-yeon, go to the 4th floor. You'll be on air right when you're at the spot. Install the infrared flashes on the ceiling. Yes, captain. Can we take a minute before moving? When the 1st floor is done, we'll be go short on the 3rd and 4th. Seung-wook and Sung-hun, let me know when you're ready. - Alright. - Sure. Can we just take a minute? Please? - Don't do that again, ever! - I got it! Can't you hear me? Let's move! Are you alright, Charlotte? Yeah. Let's go. Everyone, stand by and... Go! This is the collective care room. Take a look inside. The ceiling has fallen in and small wooden closets surround the walls. It looks like a catacomb bombarded during the war. The patients were given so-called treatments in these small wooden closets. How could they... Well, I will look into this coffin with a door. Strangely, there's a hole on the chest level, not on the face. What was this hole for? Not for the surveillance, I guess. Let me open the door. There's no knob. Why? What's wrong? - Shit. - Why? Why? - Someone pulled my arm. - What? Stop messing around, I warned you! I'm not kidding! I told you! This place is fucking cursed! Seung-wook, put in your hand. Sung-hun, shake the camera more. Seung-wook, your line. Someone did pull my arm inside that door. I can't tell exactly 'cause it happened to fast. So I will put my arm in there again. - Are you insane? - Don't do it! - Stop him! - You promised! - Don't do it! Please don't! - Why not? Let me do it! Hey, don't! It's too dangerous! - It's too dangerous! - Stop her right now! Quick! Okay, alright. I got it! Take this. No! Nothing. Ji-hyun! Ji-hyun! - What is going on? - Captain! - What is it? - Do something! Ji-hyun! Ji-hyun, your arm... They scream like they ride the pirate ship. - I hear the ping pong ball! - Get the EMF out. It was written 'Let's live' but changed into 'Let's die'! Are you sure? This place is cursed. We have to leave... or we are all gonna die. Let's leave, Charlotte. I can't be here any longer. - What are you doing? - We are leaving. - Hey, Ji-hyun. - Look at this. We never know what comes next. We're cursed. What shall I do? - Hey... - Move away, will you? Captain! You hear us? - Calm down. - You saw it too! You saw what happened at the mediumistic ritual. It even pulled my scarf, too. And it grabbed your arm too like it did to mine. And the letters on the wall changed! Listen, Ji-hyun... the truth is... at the ritual... Hey! We're scared too. We're frightened but... we're on board together so let's finish and leave together. Even captain doesn't know what to say! If any shit happens, who will take care of that? Move! We're leaving. Let's go. Be careful Charlotte. I can see someone wrote 'Let's Live' here. Oh, Scary Hey bro! Bro! Ha-joon! Say something! Yes, Seung-wook. Why didn't you say anything! The connection is bad. Ji-hyun and Charlotte left. I know. I saw. I checked the letters on the wall. Did they change? Are you kidding? No way. It was 'let's die' from the beginning. I'm just speechless. Then what is wrong with them? Don't know. They're just freaked out. Charlotte was already panicking since you touched the doll in the lab. But you just saw it, too. Ji-hyun's arm pulled and Charlotte's scarf, too. It seemed like Ji-hyun was faking She found out about our show when she insisted doing it. Why the hell would she fake it? How should I know? Maybe she just wanted to leave? - Then the scar on her arm? - Right. She might have been scratched by the thorns inside! How about Charlotte? - I saw her scarf with my own eyes! - I filmed it too! That's what I find strange, too so I keep checking the video. Was there any wind blowing in? It's fucking closed underground! How could the wind blow in? There must be something. Freaking strange. Let's stop here. You think you can fucking quit like that? Listen carefully. We have to finish this. Do you know how many are the views now? More than 300K! What if we stop now? Who would buy the ad for the halted broadcasting? Let's try just little more. A brief tour on the 3nd floor and open room 402, and it's a wrap. I promise. What if something happens! I will buy some time playing a short replay... - Let's go live again... - Screw it! Seung-wook... Lee Seung-wook! Come back! Hey you! Damn it! I shouldn't have signed on the wall. I'm cursed and might actually die. That's why we left. It should be okay. You saw it too. Charlotte! - Under my name, it's written... - I said we'd be okay! What should I do? Get up! Get up! Charlotte. We go back to the base camp now and can go home in the morning. Let's go home. We can go home. Home... Let's go home. We can go home. You see? The scarf is pulled up by itself. It's not the wind. Let's get out of here with Je-yoon and Ah-yeon. - Bro. - Yeah. Hey, let's make a deal. What? If we end here everything becomes useless. 300K view can earn $150K for ads. Let's ask for 20% more we can get at least $40K each. Continue this? As if someone's not happy... Ji-hyun... Je-yoon Seung-wook and Ah-yeon... Charlotte and Sung-hoon, all six are there. Who the hell shot this then? What the heck! No! No, don't do this to me! No! No way! Damn it! As if someone's not happy... Ha-joon. Yeah. We have some conditions. What conditions? Raise our shares by 20% each. Then we're in. And for the others, too. What do you say? Yes or no? Okay for 20% more for you and the others, too. We're going back live when the replay is done. Hurry to the 3rd floor. Don't ever cut the radio again. Or I will kill you. Was it this far? It's taking too long. Look at that! We're right on track. We put it there on the way. We put it there on the way. Almost there. Let's go. SHOWER ROOM What you see is the shower room one of the top two ghost spots along with the hallway of 4th floor in this asylum. Looking up, you can see the follow cams. But no particular signs so far. What is this sound? Is it from supply room? Leave the shower room, move to the supply room! Both of you, fast! Seung-wook, your line. We just heard strange sound coming from here, the supply room. You must've heard it, too. A loud sound of something being crashed against the wall. What was the sound? Sung-hoon, go behind the cabinet and shoot it! Seung-wook, say something first! Bro! Say it! Did you all see that? What if there's... the supernatural energy... Sung-hun! Sung-hun! Seung-wook! Seung-wook! Lee Seung-wook! Hey! Wake up! Seung-wook, please! Why? How... How is it possible? We already passed by it. This place is weird, too. Ji-hyun... Hold on. What's this smell? What? Why is it here? These were at the lab! Ji-hyun! Ji-hyun... What is wrong with you? Ji-hyun! Ji-hyun... Ji-hyun... Ji-hyun! No, don't do that! Captain! Captain... Where are you? Ji-hyun... Please help me... Save me... Please let me out! Open the door! Sung-hun... We have to leave right now! Let's go now! Fast! The door is almost opened! That doesn't matter. We shouldn't be here. We have to leave! Why? Seung-wook is locked in the room downstairs. Fuck that bastard! We're about to reach one million! What are you talking about? We must not be here. We have to save Seung-wook and get out of this place! - Yes, captain. - Ah-yeon. Open the door and get in now. Captain told me to open the door and get in now. You two listen to me. The ritual and the doll, we staged them. What? We faked it for the views! But everything going on right now is real! That fucking moron... Seung-wook might die. We have to save him now! Is this for real? I mean it! We're all going to die if we stay! If you don't do it, I'll do it myself. The ping-pong ball again! Shit! What the hell is that? What is it? What... Is someone inside? What's going on? Everything is real. Please help me! Save me! - Charlotte? - Charlotte? Is that you? - I can't open the door! - Let me do it. Charlotte! - Charlotte! - Do something! Charlotte! What shall we do? - Charlotte! - Charlotte! Sung-hun! - Hey... - Where are you going? Sung-hun! Sung-hun! Je-yoon... - Sung hun! - Sung-hun! What's going on? What the fuck is this? - Ah-yeon... - I'm here. Where's Sung-hun? Don't move. What is it under our feet? It feels like water. You have the light? What is wrong with it? - Why isn't it working? - Shit. Why is it echoing in here? I guess we are... - in room 402. - What? You got the camcorder, right? Give me that. What? Where are we? There's no door here. Why is there no door? Water? How is it possible? What's going on? There's someone. Where? - A girl... - No way. is looking down on us. Are we really in room 402? Je-yoon... On your face! The hands! You too, Ah-yeon... Don't do that... Someone's here.... We have to get out of here. Ah-yeon... Sung-hun... Ah-yeon... Je-yoon! Sung-hun! Je-yoon! Can you hear me? Please help me! Where are you? Help me, please! Save me! Sung-hun! Please come help me! Anybody here? It's not a live broaecast? It's cut off after it turns out a fake show. I knew they would manipulate it. GONJIAM: HAUNTED ASYULM Directed by JUNG Bum-shik The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayee in this production are fictitious.
