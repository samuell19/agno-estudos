Our grand opening. Our very own restaurant. I can't believe the thrill. I can feel it in the air. Tonight is the night. Everybody's gonna be there. Everybody. This is the biggest party since Chloe's parents went to Thailand. You remember that party? Uh-huh. Oh, you should see my outfit. Hotter than Death Valley asphalt. What? He's gonna-- He's gonna be there tonight? Oh, wow. This could be the night of my life. Emma, yeah, I gotta go. Yeah, big mother's watching. No, I got this thing with my family first, but I'll be done-- Rebecca. You have to concentrate on one thing at a time. Max! Where's Max? I don't know, probably playing with matches or running through traffic. Taking candy from strangers. So, Mom, it's a good thing when the holiday sauce goes lumpy? Oh, for Pete's sake, Sam, I told you not to touch that. We'll do the sauces there. Sorry, Mom. I'll just grab the salad. No! Don't you dare touch that. That's my lucky pan. Come on, bring it down now. Sam, where's Max? Doing stuff. Dr. Geekenstein refuses to leave our room. He's moved all of his funky gadgets in my area. So you can either give me my own room, like you already promised, or Max's stuff is going to find its way to the front lawn real soon. That's enough, That's enough. Max. We need you now. Go in the kitchen, get the stuff in the Tupperware and bring it now. Okay, Mom, I've been giving this a lot of thought, I have to go to that party tonight. Jason Beret-- Who doesn't know you exist. --is gonna be there. Oh. Max, come on, where you been? Doing stuff. You're afraid that if you're not there on time, Shannon DeVries will swoop right in and get her claws in, right? Ooh. Rebecca likes boys. Oh, not all boys, you little toadstool. Mom, so the party starts at 6, and I was wondering maybe I could get home with time, you know, to take a shower and wash the food stink off... I'm gonna do my best, but I can't promise anything, Rebecca, okay? This is so unfair. Why couldn't you do this at the restaurant? Because I have to spend time with my little angels. No, because the kitchen wasn't ready yet. Okay, ready. Come on, come on. Move, move, move, move. That's it. Think that's everything? Yeah. All right. Okay. The Korda caravan of crazies is ready to roll. It's show time. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is going to be so cool. My very first restaurant opening. [♪♪♪] ♪ To see the sun Come out again ♪ ♪ To see the sun Come out again ♪ [PHONE RINGING] I'll get it. Go ahead. Okay, all right. Yes, good afternoon. Spokes Restaurant. Luigi, don't be afraid to lie to me. Just tell me we're gonna be ready when that first customer walks through the door at 5. A-okay, Mrs. Korda. Don't you worry. How we doing? We're fully booked. We are. Oh, Luigi, all the lights came in? A-okay, Mr. Korda. Don't you worry. Babette, I want to remind you, put the red wine on top. Come on, come on, we gotta be ready. We don't have time. We will be. Luigi, what's two plus two? A-okay, Mrs. Korda. Don't you worry. Great. MARIE: Bonjour, Henri. Can we start the cooking now? Uh, now that we have our chef, we can. In there, and be careful with those. A place for everything. Everything in its place. Uh-oh. What, what? I have not yet seen the lucky pan. Oh, well... Now nothing bad can happen. Hey, boys, come on. The boxes in the truck have to become the boxes in the kitchen. [PHONE RINGING] All right, I'll get the phone. Go help your sister get the boxes and bring them back in. Spokes Restaurant, good afternoon, may I help you? Uh-huh, how many in your party? One for you, and one for you. Excusez-moi. Thank you. Excuse me. Don't push. Ow. Okay, where? Uh-- I know where it goes. Where's Max? SAM: He's behind me. I'll go look for him. Mom said I could help. No, she didn't. You are too young. When I was your age, I was a dishwasher. For two years I worked on spoons before the head chef even let me touch a fork. Yeah, and you only got a turnip a week to eat. A small turnip. Hey, that's my old tricycle. No, that's my old tricycle. No, that was my new tricycle, then it was Sam's, then it was Max's, and now I guess the wall's. Oh, Max, maybe now's not such a good time to tell you about the bed-wetting problem Sam had. No, I didn't! Honey, guess what? MARIE: What? Gigi Grant reviewed Porcini's. How did Allen do? One star. Oh, my-- Oh, I gotta call him, I gotta call him. Okay. [CRYING] I am a good chef. I am a good chef! One star, ha! [SNORTING AND SOBBING] [GASPS] The phone is out of service. Look at this. What? The Chronicle. Picture of Gigi. Bigfoot revealed. Wow, she's certainly not the troll I expected her to be. Wait, that's Gigi Grant? MARIE & PATRICK: Yeah. Hey, boys! What? PATRICK: All right, look, everybody. You see this woman in the restaurant, you let me know. That woman is le diable, the devil. But now if she shows up here, she gets her just dessert. She is finished. PATRICK: Memorize that face. But I can be anonymous. Obviously not anonymous enough. Every restaurant owner in this state, will have seen this picture by now. Don't make this harder than it is. You'll get another job. Reviewing moose burgers in Alaska? No chance. Where are you going? Back to work, Ollie. I'm gonna prove to you just how anonymous I can be. This just came in the mail. Just watch. They won't know what hit them, until the review comes out. Ooh, I gotta make reservations. Ta-ta. [♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGING] Spokes Restaurant, good afternoon, may I help you? [PHONE RINGING] Spokes Restaurant, good afternoon, may I help you? [♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGING] Spokes Restaurant, good afternoon, may I help you? [SIGHS] We're done. Oh! [LAUGHS] I told you not to worry. Incredible. Our night. Our night. Baby. Come on, picture, picture. Henri, watch the pot. [CHUCKLES] [GASPS] Our restaurant. Our restaurant. You pigs! Stop it. You know he started it, Rebecca. Did not! Our kids. Please, please, please. All right, photo op, photo op. Behave, behave, behave. Line up. Come on. Let me see your faces. Pretend you like each other, just for this. No, no, no. Put your hand down. Come on, come on. Here comes Mom. Now. Oh, wait, wait, wait. [LAUGHS] [CAMERA STAND CLICKING] Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, whoa, whoa-- Oh, oh. Oh, God. Oh! Sorry. Here, let me help you. Oh. Oh, thank you. Thanks. Say Camembert. ALL: Camembert! [PHONE RINGS] Oh, wait a minute. Oh. Oh. Hi. I'm Nikki, Nikki Rathbone. That's my brother Blake. We run Le Pretensione next door. MR. PORTER: Yes, hi. I'm Patrick Porter, that's my wife Marie. We've been meaning to come over and introduce ourselves, but it's just been so crazed lately. I love what you've done with the place. Thank you, and thanks for the picture. Well, my brother and I believe in helping all the restaurants in the neighborhood. Have a great opening night, congratulations. Thanks. Thanks very much. Hey, kids. What? Guys, guys, guys, come here. Quiet down, listen. Now look. I realize that mom and I have not been around very much for the last few months. We've been so busy trying to set up the restaurant. But I want you to know, it's not just mom and dad's restaurant-- MARIE: What? It belongs to all of us. What? It's-- Wait. Wonder what that was. This is not-- Talk to him. What? Talk to him. Who's this? Oh, hi. Just fix it, fix it. Uh-huh. Okay, fine. There seems to be a little problem with the certificate of occupancy. A little problem? City Hall lost our certificate. We have to file a new one by five o'clock. We have to open at five. We're fine, we're fine. We'll go down together, sign at City Hall, and we'll be back by the opening. Gregory should bring the papers here. He can't. It's his mistake. There's not time for him to come file the papers. There's time for us to go there. You go. I'm staying. We both have to sign. We don't both have to sign. Baby, we both have to go. We can't both go. I'm not leaving the restaurant, I'm not. Fine, fine. Then in a little while, there's not gonna be a restaurant to leave here? Will there be? We have to sign new papers, please. We're wasting time. Don't talk to me, don't talk to me. Not my fault. Kids, kids. Mom and I have to go somewhere. What? Henri and Babette are taking care of everything. Rebecca, you're in charge. Wait, that's not fair. MAX: You're really gonna leave? We're leaving. Remind Babette, two forks, each place setting and don't forget the wine glasses. Tell Henri not to over-whisk the hollandaise, don't mess with it. You do the reservation book. You tidy up the store room. And help each other out. All right? We gotta go. Step back, go, go. REBECCA: I have to take care of you two? And there they go. What's that? [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] It was their certificate of occupancy. There have been four restaurants on that spot. Five now, and I have buried all of them. With your help, Nikki, of course with your help. Speaking of help, did you happen to check out their help? Henri and Babette? We hardly know Henri and Babette. Sweetheart, we had them checked out. They have spotless reputations, perfect references. Absolutely flawless. NIKKI: They have spotless reputations, perfect references. They're absolutely flawless. Not quite. After all, I have low friends in low places. Spill. Well, every man has his Achilles heel. For Henri. And Babette? She has a thing for muscular Italian artists. Antonio. What a perfect specimen. I'm sure Henri won't mind spilling his culinary secrets over a nice bottle of bubbly. The icing on the cake. The sauce on the goose. The 20% surcharge on the bill. Ooh! [♪♪♪] They canceled with us. To eat here. They'll never eat in this town again. Someone should call them and have them switch to a better and more established restaurant. Can I help you, Ms. Rathbone? Oh hello, sweet thing. I realized how rude it was of me not to offer you a gift before. So, um, here... a little grand opening present. Oh, how sweet of you. [♪♪♪] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I am Antonio. I have a painting for my patron Senor Patrick Porter for his ristorante. Patron? Si, bella donna. He paid for the painting, so he's my patron. My father didn't order any painting, and he certainly didn't order that painting. Hush. I'm sure your father ordered it. This is not just a picture, this is an Antonio original. Stunning, and a welcome change from these old grimy bikes. I will need some help in finding the perfect spot for my work. [PHONE RINGING] Why don't you get that? So, it's just you and me... and champagne makes three. Mm-hm. Emma, I'm back, yeah. Okay, if Shannon is going to be fashionably late because of some dinner with her mother, that means I get an hour alone with Jason. I know. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, wait, hold on a second. Good afternoon, Spokes Restaurant, how may I help you? Okay, let me see, what time and how many people? Okay, um... Oh, how does 9 p.m. sound instead? Okay, right, for two people, Mrs. Frost. No, no, thank you, we look forward to having you dine with us. Emma, I know-- [PHONE RINGING] Wait, hold on a second. Good afternoon, Spokes Restaurant, how may I help you? Okay, how many people? Oh, you know, we can't fit in a table of six at seven o'clock, but let's see, we do have a table for four and a table for... Ma'am, four of you can eat at seven, and the other two can eat at nine, duh. What do you think of the Antonio original, bella? It's magnificent. Is this good? It was in need of a woman's touch. What shall we drink to? Hmm. What is this place called? Uh... Spokes. Well, to Spokes, to an unforgettable grand opening. To Spokes. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] Mm-hm. Hm. [BEEPING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] Oh, wait, hold on a second. Max, what are you doing? Stuff. REBECCA: Stop. Gregory! Okay, get out, come on. Gregory? Great. Let's see it. Come here, let me see it. Um, that's right. All right, that's right. Give me a pen. Where's the pen? I'm looking. Find it. Hurry up, hurry up. Here. Show me. Sign right there. Good. All right. There. Oh, oh. Here. Bye. Bye, let's go. PATRICK: All right. Bye. Let's go. [WATER SPLASHES] REBECCA: If the restaurant is successful, I want fantabulous clothes, like Shannon DeVries. Then everybody will notice me. Books and computer games and comics. I can use my own lucky pan, and saucepan in Paris. I want-- You can't get a car. That's not what I was gonna say. BOTH: Separate bedrooms. [MOANS] Have you ever seen a sadder thing in your life? We all know what happens when chefs cry in their food. Huh? Salty food? For later. Oh... Ohh. I hit you in the face. [ALL LAUGH] MAX: Hey. What are you gonna do about it, shorty? Aw. It's later. MARIE: What do you mean, don't worry? Of course I worry. The trouble with you, Patrick, is you don't worry enough. There's six million things that can go wrong with opening a restaurant. Six million and one. I'm gonna call the tow truck. No, they'll take too long. I'll do it. [LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] Antonio? Wait for me, Antonio. Thank you. Whoo-hoo! Babette? [POTS CLATTERING] Henri? Ohh. Henri? Henri? [GROANING] What happened to Henri? That door hit you in the head. Oh, oh. Did you know that sign's on the wrong door? I guess you did. What happened to Henri? Max hit him in the head with the door. You hit him first. The signs were messed up, that's your fault. Excuse me, you two did it. Look at this, "I quit, Babette." Is Henri okay? Sort of. [LOUD SNORING] You guys, what are we gonna do? We can't just leave him lying in the middle of the floor. Let's put him in the store room, and have him sleep it off. C'mon. Wow, now I see why mom and dad left you in charge. [SNORING] You guys, this isn't gonna work. You think? We'll make it work, okay? Dolly. Dolly Parton? Dolly the sheep. Dolly the dolly. Okay, go over there. One, two, three. Here we go. Are you okay? Let's go. Oh, my gosh, we're all alone. [GRUNTING] Look. Look, the tire! No, no, hey, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! [♪♪♪] Whoa. Oh, god. [GROANING] [DOG PANTING] Oh, no. Good dog. No, no! [DOG BARKING AND SNARLING] Shut up! [SIGHS] [PHONE RINGING] What are we gonna do? Mom and dad will come walking through that door any moment now. Any moment now. Seriously, you guys, what are we gonna do? Let's lock the front door, hang up the closed sign and go hide in the store room. No, there's too much at stake. Chef. Bus boy. Cool. We can't do this alone. So what are you going to do? Mom and dad left me in charge, okay? Right, left you in charge. I can't find my cell phone. PATRICK: Well, you had it before. I know. We've gotta call the restaurant. We're gonna be a bit late. No, don't worry, everything will be fine. The sooner we go, the sooner we'll get there. Don't tell me not to worry. The restaurant's gonna open in nine minutes, and we've got a full house, and we're not gonna be there. Henri and Babette will take care of it all. C'mon, just get in the car, let's go. Oh, Antonio. [SNORING] Places, everybody, it's showtime. What, dad always says that. It sounds better when dad says it. This is gonna be so much fun, you guys. I hate it when that happens.

Have you dined with us before? Of course not, but we treat all of our guests like regulars. Here, have some menus, look over them, and I'll be back shortly to take your order. Take a seat, sit down. You know you want to. Okay. Oh, my goodness, so sorry about that. I'll have some waters brought over to you as soon as possible, okay? Enjoy dinner. You're the bus boy, so bus. [SIGHS] Are you ready to order yet? I think so, yes. Oh, okay, what would you like? Hi. Hi. Whoo! I'm a little nervous. This is my first blind date. Me too, but Zack said we were a lot alike. A dinner reservation on opening night of a restaurant. I am impressed. I'm a big fan of the chef. [LOUD CLATTER] If you'll just come this way, I'll show you to your table. Okay. I can't read your writing. Which part? All of it. I mean, at least give me a hint here. The first thing is two Caesar salads, the second is two soup du jours, and the third is that tomatoey thing mom does. Okay, that's how you spell Caesar? Oh, you do know what happens if the knife is off by a fraction when you cut that tomato, right? Okay, I know what I'm doing, Rebecca. You do now. Uhh. Miss, where are our salads? Coming right up, sir. Where are the salads? Close enough. Excuse me. Oh, my, excuse me. Ah, finally. Some salad for you, and some more for you. Here you go. No, that is not done yet. Sam, please don't. No, give it, give it. It looked done to me. Fine! Mine! It's fine. Oh, just one... Crouton? Max, come here. I can't be maitre d' and waitress. So I have to be bus boy and maitre d'? Yup, that's what you gotta do. Go. Good evening, is this the Spokes Restaurant? We don't have reservations, but can you fit us in? Can we go in now? Should we take our menus? What a nice young man. You're falling behind, Sam. [♪♪♪] Oh, no! Uhh! Here you go. We've already got menus. I haven't, I'll take one. This isn't what we ordered. Hey, I ordered that, I think. We came here first. Our order hasn't come yet, so we'll take that. What? No, we were here first. Miss, who was here first? You were. Miss, are our salads ready yet? Will you take my order please, miss? Sure. I'd like... I can't read your writing. Rebecca, you have to get your act together. You first, where's the food? Blue rice? Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, no. There you go, and there you go. What did you order us? I thought it was something from planet Earth. More like Uranus. What? Should've picked another planet. Miss, could you please take our order? Miss, we never got our salads. Maybe we should just go straight to the soup. Pardon me, miss, but I'd like to change my order. Miss, I need... Miss. DINERS: Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss, I need-- Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. DINERS: Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss! Rebecca. [SCREAMING] [SNORING] BOTH: Rebecca? This can't get worse. [♪♪♪] Shouldn't you be shutting someone down? Guess who's dining next door? Nobody, I hope. Gigi Grant. Someone must've sent her a notice to the grand opening. I again bow to the master. Good evening. Ms. Stone, table for one. Right this way, mademoiselle. Why don't you go over there and help our little friends make her meal at Spokes memorable? [♪♪♪] Dinner special number one, thank you. One dinner special number one. [♪♪♪] At last. Brown until what? [SNORING] Miss, we never got our salad, and now we're waiting for our soups. This is ridiculous. You know what, I'll go check the kitchen, okay? What is that? Wait, where are those two soups? We're out of soup bowls. The dishwasher's not working. Where's Max? Get him to wash them. Max is working the desk. Oh, great. Two soup du jours, tout suite. Rebecca, you don't get it, it's locked. It won't open. No, you don't get it. I don't care. What are you doing? Here you go. We ordered soup. Oh. Voila. Different. Mmm. Very good, very good, yes. That's not on the menu? Well, it's a specialty of the house. What do you call it? Uh, Soup Rebecca. Here you go. What is it? It's dinner special number one. But what is it? I'll have one of these. Me too. All right. Two more Soup Rebecca's. What? You know, the soup in the bread bowl. We got soup bowls again. Forget about the soup bowls. The customers want Soup Rebecca. Hey, I cooked it. And I invented it. Besides, Soup Sam doesn't sound right. [CAR HORN HONKS] [TIRES SCREECH] Go. I can't run over her. [CAR HORN HONKING] All right. [LAUGHING] Excuse me, miss, I never got my bill. Oh, so sorry. Now I only had the-- The Soup Rebecca, that's a good choice. Okay, and, oh, the salad, I trust that wasn't too tangy. And, oh, spaghetti... with meat sauce, good stuff. And let's see, the catch of the day. Good choice, good choice. Okay, let's see what you got for dessert. Blueberries and cream. Oh, you got a nasty paper cut. You should take care of that. And thank you for dining at Spokes, okay? But I-- [♪♪♪] Emma, can you hear me? How's the party? Well, Jason's not here yet. It's going to be great. Luke Brennan is in the pool. You got to see the body on him. Her parents seem cool. They bailed. Sounds familiar. Huh? Oh, hey, bad news. Shannon DeVries is showing earlier. Can you be here? Oh, shoot. I have no idea. Well, I'll try. Bye-bye. Okay. Wow. Dinner Special Number 2. Your waitress will be with you shortly, Mrs. DeVries. That's my job. DeVries. I can't believe I missed that. If the word gets out that I'm a...I'm a-- Waitress? Yes. If the word gets out I'm a waitress, then she's going to bury me in school. I can't believe this. I'm blind. I got to take a break now, okay? Funny, I remember someone saying we have to do this. There's only us. What idiot said that? You did. Well, don't you quote me to me. That only applies to you and Sam. If I said it, it didn't-- It doesn't apply to me, okay? Oh, I just love the Vive La France bicycle motif. Great, mom. Can we just eat and get out of here? Oh, please, child. We were lucky we could move our reservations an hour earlier. Now let's enjoy our dinner. SHANNON: Mom. I have to get to that party and lock Jason before that leech, Rebecca, gets her grimy claws all into him. Bonjour, Madame. Bienvenue avec Spokes. Oh. Bonsoir, mademoiselle. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Oh, I am so reminded of those delightful two star bistros in the French countryside. Ooh. The poulet avec la sauce framboise sounds good. Sauce framboise is a strawberry sauce, my angel. You are allergic to strawberries. They make your face break out in blotches. You mean, I'll look like that zit, Rebecca. Great. I'll have the veal. And I will have the chicken. [♪♪♪] Hey. I'm the chef. Here you go. Oh, okay. Oh. Oh. All right. Merci. Hey. What is it? Dinner Special Number 2. Mm-hm. But what is it? Bon appétit. Mmm. Mmm. They're still open. Not for long. They're still open. I can't believe you got 51 percent of this place. Well, somebody has to run it. You can't even beat a bunch of children. [SIREN BLARING] [SIGHS] Good evening, sir. Good evening, officer. You and the car were speeding, sir. Yes, officer. License, registration. Uh, do... do you have a pen or pencil or other writing utensil, sir? Thank you. [PENCIL SNAPS] What...? Oh. What's she...? First day out of the academy? Yeah. First ticket? Yeah. Yeah. We're going to be here a while, huh? Yeah. [CRASH] Oh. [♪♪♪] Aah! Oh. Oh. Oh. It's an attack. Oh! Oh! Oh, God. Fire, fire! What? Fire. Oh. Oh. We need-- You... You come trace this pipe, and you come trace this gas line. Now. Oh, God. Who did this? Nikki Rathbone. Okay, Max. In the restaurants where mom's worked, where's the fuse box usually been? In the store room. Always? In most of them. So, what are we going to do? Something massive. [TIRES SCREECHING] What's that? What do you think you're doing? One of the customers in there ordered up some pizzas. I'm just going to go ahead and deliver it to the table. No, you're not. [SIREN BLARING] Hey. What a jerk. Hey, out of the way. Hey, I don't think so. We got a report of food poisoning inside. No one is sick in there. Hey, you know what? You guys want some pizza because I've always wanted to go for a ride in one of those things. Well, that can be arranged. Yeah. Let me guess. Wild dog on the premises. There is no mad dog here. Hey, you want to use the pizza? We'll lure it out. There is no mad dog. No one is sick. And I don't want any pizza. If those kids try anything else... heaven help them. Desserts! Table 10. Okay. [♪♪♪] This should be it. Perfect. Oh! [CART CRASHES] Okay. [BEEPING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [CROWD CLAMORING] Please remain calm. Stay seated. Drop that chicken. Stop. Don't go. Pay before you go, please. Stop. Don't go. [♪♪♪] [GROANING] [HENRI HITS FLOOR] Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, I'm all right. I'm all right. Just a bit of a spell. Thank you, young man. Oh, hmm hmm. Dinner Special Number 3, young lady. Okay. Don't cover your face, sweetheart. You're beautiful. Oh, thank you. Oh, that was-- All right. Hi. Your Soup Rebecca. Oh. Rebecca? Where is she? Oh. I knew that shrilly little plain voice sounded familiar. Finish your dessert. I thought you were in a hurry. She's here, mom. Those twerps. I'll get them. [PHONE DIALING] Child Labor Department, please. [SNEEZES] Mon dieu. My God. Look at you. What? Your face. You're all covered in blotches. Oh. Aah! Oh. Jason can't see me like this. I can't go to the party. Oh, no. I don't feel too good. Oh, let me feel your head. Oh! Oh, we have to get you home. No. I have to go to the party. Rebecca can't have Jason! I had my mind set on... It could be good. It could be good. Just give it a chance. Give it a chance. Isn't that him just coming in? Who? Jason? It is! Hide me. Shh. Natural. Natural. Shannon? Oh, she's not feeling well. Nice hair. Oh! Your table is ready. Okay, um, who's at Table 8? Uh-oh. Duh. Mr. Perfect. The love of your life. Wasn't he supposed to be at that party? Hmm. Looks like fate had other things in mind. Remain calm. No. Panic? No. You wait on them. I can't. I'm the cook. I will cover for you. Okay? Hi. And good evening. Welcome to Spokes. Spokes? Bicycles, Dad. Oh, yeah. Right. We had reservations at Le Pretensione for ages. But their lights are out. We think they're closed. Oh, yes. They must be. What do you recommend? Well, the cook's been doing some very interesting things with the recipes this evening. I trust you had a first hand look at that. Oh. Yeah. I guess you could say that. Okay. We'll have the mac and cheese here. My husband will have the Caesar salad, low cal dressing. And I'll the-- Jason will have the chicken breast, white sauce, mashed potatoes, glass of milk. I'll have Special Number 2. Mom? Special Number 2. All right. You're the waitress. Wait. You never could do anything right. You're an imbecile, Nikki. Yes, Blake. What do I pay you for? Actually, you don't pay me. Bah. Well, you don't. Time, Nikki. Broiled chicken and white sauce. Time for the lucky sauce pan. [SNORING] Oh! Ohh. [SIGHS] There you go. [HENRI SNORING] Okay. Rebecca Korda? I mean, you look just like her. These aren't your glasses. [♪♪♪] Here you go. Yummy, yummy. And for you. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, it's lovely. Enjoy. Thanks. Oh, no. Oh, no. So what do we think? Pretty good? Jason. Are you all right? What are you doing? Oh, my gosh. What are you doing? Jason. Oh, no. [DINERS CHATTERING] Cool. Can't get any worse. Can't get any worse. Two people are here to see you. What two people? A county health inspector and a child welfare officer. What? Why are they here? One wants to shut us down and the other wants to throw us in a foster home. Oh, I got to stop saying this can't get any worse. Ow. Where are we? Where are we? We-- I... [♪♪♪] Which one of you is the county health inspector? That would be me. So you must be the child welfare officer. That would be me. Watch a professional show you how to clear out a restaurant, Nikki. Match me. Oh, come on. It's not working. Make it work. But I-- Robinson. Party of three. [LAUGHS] I know, Gwyneth. I know. Make way. Make way. Make way. Loser. Oh, yeah. Mm-hm. Yeah. Some dump. Just a bunch of nobodies here. And the food, it's supposed to be lousy. Good luck. Cockroaches the size of cell phones. Good evening, monsieur, do you have reservation? Yes, but I decided to eat here anyway. And your name? Who am I? You don't know who I am? Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lost dog here... who doesn't know his name. [LAUGHS] Blake Rathbone. Mr. Rathbone to you. Your name does not appear on our reservation list. We can add you to the waiting list. Do not do that. No smoking. No cell phone either. Well, what are you going to do about it... pipsqueak? See this hand? Yes. See this hand? Yes. I am pulling out le book. I am opening le book. I am writing your name in le book, Blake Rathbone. I am shutting le book. You are banned from this restaurant. Well, I never.

Couldn't be better. Uh, excuse me. Hi. You're in my chair. Hmm? I don't think so. Guys, tell her whose chair this is. Guys, it's me. Doug. Do you know a Doug? I was only gone to the wash room for a minute. Is this gentleman with you? Don't know the guy. Never seen him before. Complete stranger. Guys. Guys. Guys. This isn't funny. They're kicking me out. But I am Doug. [ALL LAUGHING] Guys, I want to thank you for the best 30 seconds of my entire life. Well, but-- Mmm. She was only here for a short time. It was worth it. Oh, yeah. Definitely. Ooh, salmon. Oh, shoot. That was Gigi. Gigi was here. Oh, we're so dead. All right. We're out of here. Holding up the wall? Yeah. Something like that. Weren't you supposed to go to that party tonight? Weren't you? Yeah. I had this thing with my family. So you really work here? Yeah. Yeah. It's my family's restaurant, presuming we get through the evening. My dad's a maître d'. My mom's a chef. Oh, your mom's a chef. That explains those cool lunches. My mom's is peanut butter and jelly with banana. Oh. You notice what I have for lunch? Yeah. It-- FATHER: Jason? You know, I got to go. Yeah. Well, it was... it was nice talking to you. Hope you enjoyed your dinner. Yeah. It was great. Your mom's a great chef. Come on, son. Do you want to-- What? What? Have lunch with me Monday at school? Yeah. You do like peanut butter and jelly? Oh, why don't you let me take care of it? Your mother's cooking? Or maybe my brother. Cool. See you Monday? Okay. Fine. Monday. Oh. Ow, ow, ow! Ow. Ow. Oh, we normally don't allow guests in the kitchen. We're not guests. I've had it. No more half measures. No more being nice because you're children. We are going to take all the food. We are going to take all the pots and pans. We are going to take all the tables and chairs and this salt shaker and the kitchen mitt. We're going to take everything from the walls and then we're going to take the walls and the timer. Please just don't take my lucky saucepan. Your lucky saucepan? Why is it lucky? Oh, well, see? Ha! Missed me. Yes! Aah! [♪♪♪] Nikki, help me. Aah! Oh! Quick, quick, quick. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Fire! [SCREAMING] Nikki. It's your fault. Get off me! You're such a klutz. It's not my fault. Sam, I have an idea. Those dithering nincompoops. Those dastardly twerps. Nikki, it's all your fault. Aah! Nikki. Nikki. NIKKI: I hate you, Blake. I really hate you. What are you doing now, genius? Fixing the fuse box. Well, shouldn't we get a professional for this? [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] I am a professional. [♪♪♪] Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Where have you two been? What have you been doing? Stuff. Stuff. Oh, this is going to be so good. NIKKI: What was that? Are you okay? Of course I'm okay. It's those children. They won't be okay, because I'm going to kill them. What's this doing here? Gimme that. [BOTH SCREAMING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [♪♪♪] [EXPLOSIONS] Cool. Oh, wow. That's pretty. [COUGHING] [BOTH LAUGH] That was so cool. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We make a great team. Yeah. Sorry about your party, Rebecca. That's okay. There's going to be other parties. The grand opening of Spokes was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Or at least I hope it was. Are you two crazy? That was great. People were nice to me. People were scared of me. People bribed me. I'm working tomorrow. Do you think dad will get me a tux? Uh, no. No. Mom. Dad. Oh, my gosh. What happened to you guys? Are you okay? Yeah, we're fine. Yeah. Where's Henri and Babette? You don't want to know. Why? Babette bailed. Henri's sleeping off a hangover. What? What about the restaurant? We had to run it. BOTH: You? Kids. That was a great meal and everything, but-- I'd like you to meet our parents. This is Marie Korda, our chef, and Patrick Korda, our maitre d'. Mom, Dad, these are some nice people from the County Health and Child Welfare departments. Whoa. Hello. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you, I think. Oh, we must have missed you when we first came in. Yeah. You must have. Because, you know, I was probably in the... La Pretensione next door looks awfully unhealthy and unsafe. You better go check that out right about now. Yeah. Care to join me? Sure. Bye. Okay. Well, thank you. Good luck. See you later. The food was great. Oh. Thank you. Thank you very much. Go check that out now. Bye-bye. Oh. Whose idea was this? It was mine. But I joined in. Me too. It was our grand opening. We were fully booked. We know how much this restaurant means. We weren't going to let anything come in the way of its grand opening. Yeah. Guys. Oh, well. Ha. It could've been worse. Um... What? What? What? Oh, Gigi Grant was here to review the place. Oh. Ohh. Yeah. I'm sorry, Dad, Mom. What's a synonym for inept? Incompetent, helpless, hopeless, blundering. And what's another word for bad taste? Inferior, rotten, miserable. [♪♪♪] The Times come yet? No. Morning. Good morn... Oh, good morning. Oh. Oh. Look at you. What is this? Okay. You guys. Oh. Omelet. Oh. That's so sweet. I'm impressed. I think I'm still dreaming, but... Mmm. I'm impressed. Very good. Oh. [♪♪♪] Showtime. Ohh. Well. Spokes. This isn't our restaurant. I mean, the name's right and the address is the same, but it's not our restaurant. Roast Beast? Soup Rebecca? I-I don't think we cook these things. Well, uh, we, uh, did last night. Soup Rebecca. BOTH: So how did we do? BOTH: Three stars. Ah! I'm so proud of you. Daddy! Oh.
