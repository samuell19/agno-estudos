Go! Six seconds. Go! FOR A COP'S HIDE Monsieur Choucas! Did you notice that I said Monsieur Choucas instead of Inspector Choucas? That was an astute observation. Very astute. And all in order to say that you don't have a badge anymore. And if you have no badge then you have no right to carry weapons. And if you're not allowed to carry a gun, then this is a violation. We are arresting you then you explain yourself to the head. You got into a pretty mess That is if we want you to. Is Marie Therese doing well? We don't know her. What a pity. She is attractive! Just settled down in a nice flat on the Pontuet street. She's in trouble. Oh yeah? Yes, but two police officers cover her. She's calm. OK, guys. Are you going to arrest me or not? I've got work to do. Bye Michelle! Bye Choucas! FOR A COP'S HIDE How are you doing, gorgeous? Relax damn it! There are people in here! Where? - A client in your office. - I'll see you later. Don't piss me off! Madam. Monsieur Choucas? Yes. Isabelle Pigot. - Sit down please. - Thank you. This is about my daughter. She's missing. How long? A month. - Did you go to the police? - I was just... Excuse me. Yes! A policeman has come to see you. He says it's urgent. Excuse me. What's wrong Coccioli? I'm sorry Choucas. I wanted to come earlier... Earlier than who? Pigot. The one who's in your office now. I tried to call you It was engaged all the time I was out to drink a cup of coffee. You're fired! From now on or shall we see later about that? We'll see. Shall we talk? Yes, I know that her daughter is missing. Take that case. Take one thousand francs from her, then tell her that the investigation gave no results. Ok? Not quite. You can also explain to her that private detectives are no better than the national police when it comes to looking for missing people. No. She'll go to another place. And they'll deceive her there. We're friends. That's why I sent her to you. A private detective is exactly what she wants, as I said. She has read too many books. Listen to her story. Take the money. You don't have to do anything else OK? I'll see. It will depend on my decision. On what? What decision? Yes, my decision... Consideration... Consideration. Will... Have you heard about things like that? Choucas, we allow you to work, providing a royal composure, even if you forget what you shouldn’t do. But I won't advise you to abuse it. Do you understand what I am talking about? This is not a case of panties. She doesn’t wear panties. Who? Me? What are you talking about? Panties. You'll be informed Coccioli! I'm sorry. That's Ok. Did you appeal to the chief inspector Coccioli? Yes, it was him who accepted me. May I? Yes, please. This is my daughter Martha. They told me at the police station that she has simply left. But I think she's missing. We had an excellent relationship with her. I'm sure something has happened to her. How old is she? 28. Height? Oh, I don't know really. 1,70. Go on please. She lived with me in Versailles. Worked at the Institute. What Institute? The institute named after Stanislas Boudriard. It's engaged in the socialization of the blind youth. Is she blind? Yes. From birth? Yes. Is it the reason you're so sure she couldn’t leave with someone, with a man? No. I just know her, and that's it. Are you going to look for her? You will need to fill out a check madam Pigot! Then I'll ask you the same questions you have already answered at the police. Thank you monsieur. Fill it out in the name of Tarpon. Ogien Tarpon, my companion. You bring me the medical certificate when you have it. Great. There. Thank you, monsieur Jude. Don't mention. Thank you. Hello. Yes it’s Jude! Tell him tonight! I know that. Jude! But I don't know you... Tonight! He says tonight. Transfer this on the account. Wait. You need to sign this. What's this? Application for dismissal. Don't get at me. Say hello to your husband. I will! Have a nice weekend! Yes, I'm on the spot At your disposal. You can go, Perez. Very well monsieur. One Martini, George. My name is Jean. Thanks George. Which one of them is your husband? The one in the burgundy jacket at the big table. And your wife? That woman, a bit in flesh. Brunette. Oh, yes. Yes, we have free relationship. Thanks monsieur. Have a nice day. Thank you, George. My name is Jean monsieur. Have a nice day. - Bastard! - No, why? He has won a lot, but nothing proves that he payed with your money. And that he took it from the cash register. Perhaps you'll tell me he's clean? I didn't say that, but something's wrong here. He won too easily, kind of mechanically. Damn it! What are you trying to say? I don't know yet. Something's wrong here, and that's it. I know something's wrong here. This week I noticed the shortage in cash again. I know, I know... How long have you been playing tennis? For 3 years. Why? Just asking I'll go then. Yes, sure. I want to get him. I'll send you the check tomorrow. Did you see? Right on the line. Yes. Monsieur Choucas? Let's say that's me. I want to tell you that I'm coming up. Yes? My name is Pradier. Charles Pradier. I'm happy for you. I need to talk to you. It's about Pigot's daughter. Martha Pigot. She's not missing. She ran away from home. I'm listening. She ran off with my friend. They met for some time. My friend went to work abroad. And she left with him. She loves him and he loves her. It's a love story. I'll cry later if I may. Why didn't they tell her mother anything? That's the current generation. You know what it's like nowadays! What's your friend's name? That's not important. Yeah? And do you know Martha Pigot? Yes. Really? What's she look like? What do you mean? Blonde, brunette, tall,shortish, thin, fat? What's she look like? Blind. Blonde or brunette? Quickly. Brunette! Damn it, that's enough! There's no problem! She wrote you this. Here! What's this? It's Braille, Choucas. Blind people write in Braille It's read with fingers. Yes. Monsieur Choucas. Yes. I need to meet you, urgently! - Ok, I'll see you in half an hour. - Neither at your place, nor at mine Trocadero site. At 6:00. I can be there earlier. Excuse me. What are you doing? I'm calling the police. You don't have to. They are aware. They got the same letter. They were completely satisfied. Case closed. We'll see about that. Not so fast. Let's go! Damn it! Damn it! - Want some? - Yes please thanks. You're probably very tired. No. Everything's fine. Then would you mind telling that story again? No, none at all. I came home at 6. My phone rang... That will do otherwise I'll become uproarious! Just go! May I know what the Braille letter was about? Nothing essential. That's my letter You must have it's interpretation. Dear Monsieur. I learned that my mother has asked you to... To find me. It's useless. I left of my own free will... In order to join my fiance abroad. I don't want to see my mom yet. You may tell her that. You're only wasting your time and my mom is wasting her money. Your sincere Martha Pigot. Satisfied? As you say. What do you think about it? I think I'm being taken for a fool. And you? Me too. Damn! Is he here? I'm asleep I thought you were fired. I asked for forgiveness in bed. Coffee? Would you like too? Yes please. Well! He's not talkative. He's always like this until he drinks a cup of coffee. I thought I might have some rest. Me too. And instead I spent the night with Commissioner Chauffard. Yes, Chauffard has been removed from the case. Go on. They pass the case to Madrier whom I actually know. I was in Marseilles with him 4 years ago. He was to investigate the disappearance of Pigot's daughter. Clearly speaking you were supposed to be removed from that case too. In a way, yes. Thanks. Anyway your client is dead. Police knows about it. I think you'll stop your investigation. In case I'm not around, this is Martha's father Fanch Tanguy. Isabella Pigot. Fanch Tanguy. That's just what we need, a Briton. In this whole mess. Thanks for the coffee. Your companion, Tarpon, is he real? Yes. - You can never see him. - He's very modest. There's something else I wanted to tell you, but I can't remember. - Next time. - Yes. Find me madam Pigot's address. Did you find anything interesting? See the car across the street? Get into the driving seat we just want to talk. Do you happen to be Pigot's daughter's fiance? What were you looking for upstairs? You. Anything else? Nothing else. Just wanted to take a look and I did. That's interesting. What's interesting? Interesting. It's the first time I come to a man who was killed not that long ago, and see cops everywhere. Interesting. Your client's dead? What more do you need? It's my responsibility trait. I was paid for two weeks in advance. Perhaps you have some other clients. Maybe. Who? Fanch Tanguy. Let's go. We need to talk it over. Start the engine. First turn on the right. Why? Isn't it quiet here enough? No. Here? Let's go then. Is everything OK? Yes. We can deal with that. What about him? - Well, he's actually dead. - Let's go. Ok... Ok. Take care then. It just can't be. Didn't you come too early? Please take your gun away. I'm a cop too. Prove it. Go on! Are you alone? I work better that way. Ok. And? And... You've got somewhat into a mess Choucas I say somewhat. Let me see that huge widget. Never use a 45 caliber pistol. It makes a lot of noise and looks rough. I think with this same gun they killed Pigot's mother. Seriously? Moron! Oh my God! Are you aware you don't look so good? Is he at home? Who? - Your husband. - No, he's not but... Are you wounded? It's nothing Listen... Why don't you come in? You didn't invite me in. You are the most fastidious man I've ever known. I'll call the hospital. No wait. Don't yell you'll wake up the whole neighborhood. Never mind, they'll think I'm having sex. Do you utter this kind of sounds when you make love? Such things happen to me. I have a doctor friend. Wait I just killed a police commissioner. Very clever... I had no choice. I need wool alcohol and bandage... Why? It's inside. Who? The bullet. But you'll help me Go get your first-aid kit I'm a secretary and not a nurse. Don't get at me. If I could see anything I would do it myself. Great but I don't know anything about it. I've never done this before. Is it ok... I'm not a specialist in that? So,I'll just do what you say. Here's everything you asked. Do it. I hate you. Will you tell me later what happened? I'll tell you everything. Do it. Besides, if I'll hurt you, you'll start yelling. No, I'll just fire you. Bitch! Shut up. Why did you overturn the table on him? He was going to kill me at that moment. He had planned it from the very beginning. Besides, I came with a 45 caliber pistol in my hand. It was perfect for him. He fired into the wall to prove that I had fired the first shot. And in that case his actions would be regarded as self-defense. You'll see tomorrow in the newspapers it'll work out perfectly. And I will be the murderer of Pigot's mother and Commissioner Madrier. How will they connect these two murders? The same weapon. I say all this to point out that Madrier was still a fool. He could kill me first, and only then shoot into the wall. He had a sense of consistency. Anyway the result is obvious You almost got into a mess. Wake me up at 6. And don't forget the shirt wool and... If he turns up, you didn't see me. I'm going to bed. Hello? Who? Yes. No, I don't know anything. What? Ok, if I see him. That was commissioner Coccioli. He wanted to talk to you. Dear Coccioli... In a fit of rage the former ARB inspector killed the police commissioner. Are you listening? Yes go on! No doubt it was Choucas, the killer with a 45 caliber pistol, who also killed mother Pigot at the Trocadero. Exposed by the commissioner Madrier he killed him with the same weapon. You were right I've got to go. - And what about the croissants? - I don't have time. Thanks for the coffee... shirt... and everything. Where are you going? I think it's time to talk to Tarpon. I agree with you. Be careful. Here. What's this? Grey Lancia parked on the street corner.. You didn't rush. I didn't want to wake you up in the middle of the night. You should. We invented for you a fictitious companion named Tarpon so that you could use some information and assistance, which you can get from a retired cop named Haymann. That same Haymann prefers to keep in the background. Yes, but... In the background. Neither in the dark, nor aside... Ok? Well I'm here. No? I was just worrying. 2 sugars like always? Like always. Thank you. Let's go! Let's go! Madrier and Coccioli. What do they have in common? They were together in Marseilles several years ago. Worked in the financial department. He told me about that. Did he tell you that something strange was going on in the department all the time? Madrier was also involved in that. They were in a bundle. Because of what? I made some calls last night. I hope I'll find it out soon. What else? This. He's dead, that Fanch Tanguy. Damn! Tell me. Fanch Tanguy whom they called Fanch the whistler. He's been dead since 1944. He was a scoundrel. An extremist of British National Party. Half musician half French gestapo man. Crazy about traps extortion, obtaining information... What goes to... Do you mean torture? Right. And when he did it he was whistling just like in one german movie, where there was a maniac who was whistling before he killed. And his nickname was Fanch the whistler. Don't be nervous. I had cousins, to whom he did all that. You know what we, jews, are We feel nervous for nothing. How he got killed? He was shot during a control at the Spanish border in 1944. Do you know a man about 2 meters tall with a bandaged hand? What is it? He struts in front of the house. Damn it! A friend of mine. One bullet in front of the firing pin is empty, the other 5 are full. Did you see him following you? No, that's what I'm worrying about. Don't move! Don't be stupid Choucas! We have your secretary. You ought to hide your weapon. We might be detected. It's neither on my behalf nor yours. Ok. I thrust my hand into my pocket to get the Polaroid photo, which may arouse your interest. Ok. You'll come with me. You and the old man. To talk to my friends. If the negotiations don't begin until midnight, my colleagues have been instructed to cut off mademoiselle's fingers. Understand? You have no choice. You must agree. There's at least one thing I can do. - What's that? - This I'm not sure that your reputation in the quarter improved. Do you have a hammer? There must be. Hammer. Hammer. Did you break his nose? Well,yes. I'm happy that I made you pay off old scores. In your profession it's important. You'll have this for a few weeks with a little rehabilitation. Then you'll be as good as new. Unless you don't say where my girlfriend is. Int that case I will have to break your arm once again, and the other one too I'm afraid. I'll do it personally and everything will go smoothly. So what do you say? I think I asked very politely. No? Yes, absolutely. Were losing time, Kasper. Ok. Where to now? Another 50meters and turn left. Left. Open your mouth. Listen Goddamn it... Open your mouth. Oh my God oh my God, Choucas! I feel ashamed in front of your friend. Untie me from this damn bed. I'll wait for you there. Are you OK? I'm in great shape What did you think? Give me a cigarette. We'll go down find your clothes and take off. Deal? Did we arrive on time? At the time of sexual harassment? No, you didn't arrive on time. No doubt he went to seduce women with his plaster. Moron! What a moron! Yeah? There's a question I'd like to ask. Is life short? It's too short. Where are we going? I don't know. OK. There will be cops crawling all over your place. At my place too. The same with hers. That's for sure. There is a place a bit further not far from Saint-Lys. I have a friend in Sayen. That doesn't say anything to me. I know where he keeps the keys to the apartment. So your friend is interested in it. Where's it? Trocadero. Very suitable place. What does your friend do? He's a director. Short films, television. But mostly advertisement. He loves traveling. He has made a list of the countries he has already visited and of those he has never been. He tries to find a girlfriend in every country. He's a bit half-backed. Well,he's your friend after all. When is he coming back? Not earlier than 10 days. Your friend got a very nice place. If you don't need me anymore, and if I may, I'll go take a bath. And what? Almost nothing. They talk about you and Madrier. They've found Pradier. But they see no connection. Is that all? No. At the end of the afternoon we're meeting one person whom I managed to contact. He's Spaniard. He has information about Fanch Tanguy. And you? What me? Look... assume you checked his pockets. Can't hide anything from you. We have collected a small collection. Yes it's really nice. Here... Identity in the name of Constantini Lionel born in Moulins, March 1937. Registration certificate, driving license. The Boudriard Institute lacks virtues. What's this all about? The Boudriard Institute of the blind youth. Pigot's daughter worked here before she disappeared. - Are these new? - Yes 100,200,350 francs 18315722 - this may be a telephone number. We'll find out soon. - 18 - 18 315722. Hello? This is Green hill. Monsieur Tarpon speaking. Say your card number. Excuse me. "Green hill". You'd better check it. Two metro tickets and a box of matches. Empty. Nuson Rene Eo Orleans 46. We've got work to do. Sometimes you annoy me. I know, but we have some time before our meeting. - Would you like to play chess? - No. This will calm you down. I don't want to calm down.. What's wrong? Some sort of frustration caused by the inability to resist to the opponent. Oh, fine. He killed Fanch Tanguy. Ask him if that's Fanch Tanguy. Who's he? Tanguy. The man whom you killed at the Spanish border. Yes he's dead. How? In the process of control. We stopped a car with 2 men. One of them fred, and we also began to shoot. We killed one of them the other one was arrested. We found dollars, lira, a lot of gold and golden wedding rings. Understand? And what happened to the second one? I don't know. He fled to the mountains. His fate is unknown. Is that all? Yes. Oh, remembered. The man who had escaped... We learned about this later. He was a doctor. Damn! That's right. Duville. Look where you're going locust. Asshole! They talked about you on television recently. Really? About you, about those two dead bodies, about everything. They said you have clinched a deal. They also said that the police hopes to find you in the shortest time. Did the ballistic examination establish a link between the two incidents? - No, it was a witness. - A witness? A young man of good family driving red Monte Carlo. Cognitive. It's starting to smell bad. My potatoes? No. I think it's time to talk with the man who started it all. I agree. Tasty or not? Just don't answer with one voice. What? My potatoes. It's very tasty. Delicious. Want to know the secret? Arrange the meeting on neutral territory. Yes. It is necessary to put a small melted cheese in. To whom? Coccioli? I was talking about potatoes. Tonight you are unbearable. Fortunately I have Keko. What's that? Dessert? Felista. Felista? I forgot to tell you that Charlotte knows a lot of fascinating words. Enjoy the show. Dear viewers thank you for staying with us on TF 1. And now, as promised, we'll meet with Sophia Loren, In the remarkable film "The Devil", by Jean Kieukor. It's George, stupid! George Kieukor. George. Tell me. I understand, you have someone. Yes. Don't you think he may be worrying about you? It's not his style. Don't you think you should let him know? Is it OK if we talk later? After the movie. Yes. I'm sorry. That's OK. My husband doesn't really care where I am. Coccioli, Choucas speaking. Where are you? Chew it over if you want to talk. OK, come see me then. What's the tag? R-14, gold yellow. Plate number? 88-SP-75. Follow the outer lane from the side of Versaille door. Take the right side at 50 mph. Got it? How far shall I go? You'll ride around Paris until I give you a sign I'm sick of these migraines! Really? This is awful... I can't even sleep. Is that so? Not here, if that's possible. Don't worry! Gentlemen. Something warm with mint. Coffee. I'm sorry you're having health problems, well, I'm doing just fine. Perhaps you are aware? Yes. If you explain to me the rules of the game, I might have even more fun. That's not a game. No, on the contrary. We play a game of errors, omissions, anomalies. For example Madrier. You almost warned me and thus saved my life. But you forgot to tell me why the SRPJ department was closed. Why? Half of the French police is looking for me. I call you, make an appointment and you come. Alone. Don't tell me that's because you like me. None at all. What is it then? Damn it! You may think what you want. I don't care. You know how everything goes with police officers like me. There are families, companies, which are formed around those who have the same skeleton in their closets. Outwardly, all's well but we do nothing. In particular, we are not trying to understand with whom it begins and ends. And your problem is that one day you'll find yourself out of that company. What do you know about Fanch Tanguy? Before seeing the photo I'd never heard of him. Let's suppose. What did the financial department encounter before it collapsed? I don't know. Madrier figured out something but it had nothing to do with that. He worked for cops from the opposition. Complete nonsense. I agree. You got me into this. Now I have to go to the end and I'll do it. And you will do exactly as I tell you. I want the full record on Kasper. Charles Pradier and Madrier. So extricate yourself. I'll let you know. I'll take care of it. Do you think I should trust you? I'll take care of it myself. Cocioli, you better know that if I fail I'll take you with me. Sit! OK, we'll try it another way. What are they doing here? Nothing doing... Damn it! Follow me young people. That's what happened! Damn it! I understand you wasted my car? Yes, completely I hadn't even fully paid for it. We'll buy you a new one. Easy. Great. - What now? - Nothing! We'll see tomorrow. No, tomorrow we won't be able to move... since they'll have our large photos published in the newspapers. Perhaps tonight? Why? Nuson Rene Eo I should meet her. Will you replace my bandage? If I want to. And bring me a clean shirt, will you? Your friend must have a clean shirt in the drawers. Why are you so sure that because of that pursuit on the freeway our photos will be in the newspapers? Because I left my gun in Charlotte's car. The one used to kill Madrierand Pigot, Great! Don't irritate me. No, in this case you can make a menacing face. I advise you to stop it and make me rather strong coffee. - Stop it. - Nuson Rene? Right? Right. General inspectorate of national gendarmerie. It'll take long. I know. Lionel Constantini. What did he do? Some stupid things. Come in. - Would you like some rum? - No thank you. So what did he do? He was involved in a skirmish on the way to the Blue Fountain. Is he... Is he... Is he dead? Is he dead? He's in the hospital. He's done to a turn, but he'll be fine. Where is my glass? I'll pour you another one if you answer my questions. OK. Do you know a man named Fanch Tanguy? No. Pradier? He's dead. Did you know him? Well,yes. He worked with Lionel. How long? - How long? - Not too long, damn it! Yesterday somebody called Lionel. He hung up and said that Pradier was dead. I'll call the hospital. After I finish. I don't know what you want or where you came from. I only know that you are not from the police. So what? Now you'll have to convince me to answer your questions. Well,I have a great way to do that. Yes, it is convincing. But be careful. Only three questions, no more. Like in fairy tales. Do you know a man named Kasper? No. That was the first one. What is "Green Hill"? It's a clinic for weight loss, from the side of Mian. I met Lionel there. My boss was on treatment and I accompanied him. Lionel had to talk to him and he came there. That was the second one. What does your boss do? He runs the Institute for the Blind Youth. That was the third question. Still alive? - Why aren't you sleeping? - I was waiting for you. "Green Hill" is a clinic for weight loss, from the side of... Milan, I know. Really? Say at once that we've worked in vain. No, go on. Nothing special as usual. They stuff you with pills. You leave that place after losing 3 kg, which you gain back after the first glass of wine. Exhausted and without money. There. I smell a rat-a-big. What about you? - Nothing special. - Except what? Except that I'll have to visit the blind. What are you looking for? Is Haymann asleep nearby? I'm looking for a place where I could lie down. I'm just warming it up. Are you making me an indecent proposal? - Everything's indecent in this world. - I think so too. It's quite shocking. I called George tonight. And what? Nothing. I just phoned him to say hello 2 or 3 times and hang up. Kiss me. We could find out more but all this seems too complicated. We'll see but I'm not sure. It can't be! OK, then... Wait! He doesn't hear anything. How so? He sees and hears nothing until he has drunk his coffee. One hundred percent disability. How about now? Not yet. Go ahead. Instead of huge images, we have the following... firefight not far from the Blue Fountain on page 4 one wounded, and on page 5 the car, turning to the south of Pars behind the police outpost provoked an accident on the road. No link has been established. No mentioning of the 45 caliber pistol Nothing. Two different incidents, that's all. They're covering everything. Exactly. This way we can work at least. - Exactly. - What does it mean? Why do you think they conceal it? To protect themselves. And if they did it deliberately to let you work, like you said... How much did you pay for the car? Two million francs. Too much. With a fake car registration and plates. Then it's inexpensive. It's about time. She was supposed to come out. Don't worry! The only thing... Damn! What? We have Nuson across the street in the green coat. She looks strange. It's not surprising. She was drunk yesterday. If she doesn't come out in 5 minutes you'll go there. OK. There she comes. That wasn't easy I had to act. Did you see? Yes I did. I said I'm looking for a job. - I saw that red-haired. - Yes, Nuson. We saw her coming in. He was quite handsome, tall tanned bond like the cover of the magazine. He probably spends an hour under the lights every morning. Furthermore polite and smiling. Pretender, so to speak. His name is Jacques Decrou. It was marked on the door. Written. Not marked, but written. He's not feeling well. OK, hopefully Nuson is so impressed with your yesterday's visit that she decides to tell her boss about it. We'll find out soon. Do you know that Constantini had some Volvo papers in his wallet? Really? Do you know that my friends are in that car? Bend down! Is he the director? That's him. Let's take a look. Follow him chauffeur. What? I have a feeling... What happened? I thought we were following them. We're not following them anymore. Yeah? Why? Because I already know where they are going. Do you really know where they are taking that woman? - "Green Hill" - That's right. Why aren't we going there? First we have to go to the pharmacy. Do you need aspirin? Did you see that bald shorty? That Volvo driver. Yes. I knew I had already seen him somewhere. And I just remembered. Last time I saw him he was playing casino with Albert Perez. The laboratory technician from Jude's pharmacy - It can't be! So it was an insignificant case of an apothecary, who suspected his laboratory technician of taking money from the cash register. - Right? - Right! And here comes the link between the pharmacist's case and Pigot's mother. The same motive. - You can always find a motive. - What do you mean? That this is a coincidence. Elen, sweet, come here. Yes, monsieur Jude. Where have you been? I called you several times. Have you been connected to the police by mistake? No, nobody answered. Why are you talking about the police? Aren't you reading newspapers? Why are you asking! Just asking. Where's Perez? That's why I called you. He hasn't been coming since Monday. He's disappeared that bastard. That's all I wanted to know thank you. - What about the case? - In progress I can only say that it's not he who robs you. No? He has found something better. How's tennis? Albert Perez the laboratory technician lives here. - It won't take long. - You can't talk! Did you see him? Yes. Dead? Only flies are now interested in our friend Perez. My God! What am I doing? I hadn't beer clear from the very beginning... what the SRPJ department had found out in Marseilles... I think I found what it was. "Green Hill" is a pseudo medical institution with it's algae treatment, laboratories and preparations. They used acetone and other similar drugs. Do you understand? - So what? - So what? On the basis of these medicines in a well thought but also a very simple way you can convert morphine into heroin. Do you understand what I'm saying? That's right. Damn! But it doesn't explain what Perez has got to do with that. He was used for the money laundering. From the outset, it seemed to me rather strange the way that bald guy played. He did it mechanically. Now I understand why the American lost to Perez and the bald guy. He wasn't really losing, but paying a large sum that way. What are you going to do? Get angry a bit! Who's it? You're just on time. Calm down, Choucas! I don't want to calm down. Oh, damn it! You're now going to tell me about Perez and everything else. No... damn it Choucas. I don't... I'm all ears, Coccioli. Perez was an informant. I think you already know that. He was killed most likely on Sunday or Monday morning. Stop it, Choucas! That's right Choucas stop it! - Commissioner Chauffard? - In the flesh. Oh no, Choucas! You can't... Commissioner Radiolli. Did your nervous attack pass? Almost. No, that was my moustier! You're disgusting. This is an old family moustier, Choucas. Aren't you disgusting, Coccioli? But I'm doing my best. You've come to make inquiries about the case which I no longer control.. How so? - Perez was my informant. - Really? I knew him two years. He was quite a curious person. This Perez was an honest worker by day, and an inveterate gangster by night. I think he liked that. Get to the point! 5-6 months ago Perezian friends... - Friends of Perez? - Yes! They came to offer him a job associated with winning money in casinos and gaming halls. To me that job seemed trivial since Perez was a nobody, and I didn't know that it will be a big mistake. But by the end of the third month he had already won more than one million lire. This case was no longer insignificant, and I told everything. - Whom? - Me. It's natural, you were removed from the case within 24... At that time I learned that Perez had taken the money to a bistro. It took me 3 weeks to track down the guy who came for the money. He wasn't bad at all, a bourgeois... Jacques Decrou. The director of the Boudriard Institute not far from here. That's right. Want to know more? Pigot's daughter worked in that institute. A few days later she vanishes without leaving any address. Of course, it's a coincidence. Not quite. Do you have any thoughts about what has happened to Pigot's daughter? I think we'll find her corpse someday. - And the Briton Fanch Tanguy? - Red herring. Madame Pigot was killed because she talked about Fanch Tanguy. She was killed because she was the mother of young Pigot, who worked at the Institute of Boudriard And that's all! It's a bit simple. A bit. OK. Continue. I think I'm going to like it. Perez also told me that there was a girl in the pharmacy, who took the money from the cash register, whose name was... What was it? Elen? - Yes. - Damn! - What? - No, nothing. Go on! Perez detected you probably due to Jude's negligence. And on the other hand there was Pigot's mother holding me. And I had an idea. You wanted to stay clean? I wanted to be humble in this business and suddenly I said to myself: 'Perhaps I shouldn't be bashful?' Course. You can always stay in your shelter and find some dupe like Choucas. Am I right? Well,that's the way it is. Yes. Just in case you're not aware Coccioli I'm in great danger. The same killer who wants to kill me, has probably killed the young blind girl. Of course you'll fix that on me and I'm still unaware. What would you do if you were in their situation? Tell me! Just tell me! I would have skinned you as soon as possible. Cop's hide doesn't worth much. Especially when it's a former police officer. I'm not saying anything. This is not surprising that you're a little nervous. Bastard! You draw me into this. I was like a bait while hunting. He's at it again. Stop! Stop! Well do something! Look what you've done. - Maybe we can talk it over? - OK. In front of me there are three police officers who use deceitful methods. But try to do your job at least. For what? In order to defeat their laboratory and smash everything. And stop all this mess. We could do that, but nobody knows where their laboratory is! It's close to Milan. In a clinic for weight loss which is called "Green Hill". And what do you suggest? Bachhoffer, professor Bachhoffer. - Does it say anything to you? - No why? While you were talking to your friends, I got a phone call. Bachhoffer-that's with 2 f. That's the doctor who was in the car with Fanch Tanguy back then. - Is it interesting? - I didn't say that. - How far? - We're almost there. I understand you didn't sleep well last night. That's right. Commissioner Haymann? Relax Coccioli. I retired. But what... He's trying to ask what you're doing here. He also has another name Ogien Tarpon, my companion. - Damn! - You know best. OK. It wasn't so easy. Here's the identity, driving license, false documents in the name of Serge Patrick Bondeau. That Bondeau should arrive in the "Green Hill" today for a five-day treatment. Here's your pass and an account of 3500 francs. Nobody will reimburse this expense of mine. Unfortunately. I'm sorry too. Really. But what can you do? That's the job. The most important thing is... Did you find out where Kasper is? No. I had 10 men, and we couldn't find him. Damn it, Coccioli! I don't like it. We hoped... He can cause a lot of trouble. That guy's dangerous. Anyway he won't come out alive. You are not going there. Yes, I am. When will Chauffard and his men be here? In one hour. We'll instruct them to go after you if you don't come out. Let's hope so. Choucas! Call Charlotte and tell her if she doesn't not bake a pie until this evening, she's fired. GREEN HILL - Yes. - Serge Blondeau. - You were supposed to arrive at 11:00. - My car broke down. Everything is possible, but all the doctors who can open the case and appoint a procedure are no longer here. At this time of the day they can only take a bath. Doctors take a bath? No, those who are on treatment. And the doctors don't work at this time. If I find a room he can stay. Then he'll see the rest. Room 310. Serge Patrick Blondeau. Being disturbed by the glands high content of protein high blood pressure. - You're actually experiencing all this? - Well yes. - I'll accompany him. - OK. Follow me. You will hear the call at 15:00. Go down to the reception and you'll see doctor Malvou. - Very well thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me! - Here. Room 310. - Thank you. Come on Michelle. Move it, move it! Everything's ready! The bath was clogged. But now everything's fine. OK, thank you! Excuse me I have just arrived and I've been told that it's here. - What's here? - Doctor's cabinet. - OK, but who's the doctor? - Malvou. Oh, come with me, come with me. He has been told many times to put a signboard or something like that. But he doesn't care. Everybody thinks you should go to the right. Come. I'll show you. - Isn't it on the right? - No, you'll see. Thank you. You're welcome. Go ahead! This is surprising, Kasper. I thought you had left France 48 hours ago. Why 48 hours ago? Since this institution is under surveillance for already two days. Go on. They'll be here in an hour. Thanks for the warning. Now you'll go with me without any resistance. Let's go! Cuff him! We'll take care of him and the others and then we'll go. It's all over. - You broke my arm, remember? - Don't be nervous, it'll take only a second. - No, you won't do that. - I surely will. That's it. At first, the pain is unbearable, then it subsides. I know from my personal experience. Then if you don't move much, It seems quite tolerable. Your friends will find you Good-bye, cop! Bachhoffer! Martha Pigot? They have stuffed her with drugs. You looked much better when I saw you last time. We need to get out of here. They wanted to kill her, but I wouldn't let them do that. Do you understand? I think I do professor Bachhoffer. Baby daughter heard your whistle, and it reminded her of one story. And her mother told her everything. She's the daughter of my old friend Fanch Tanguy. Easy! - I told you to get this over with. - No. Don't move! Stop this nonsense, Chauffard! Bachhoffer died of a heart attack. Martha Pigot was cured from addiction. She'll be back to the Boudriard. She's OK Chauffard, Radiolli and Coccioli... were promoted in rank. Since they helped a little. You will not be involved either for Madrier's nor for mother Pigot's murder. The press will be talking about you for some time for appearances sake. This is known in France. The private detective is to look after the recess As for the recess. Don't be such a drag Haymann. Do you know who came to the office? Monsieur Jude, the pharmacist. He wanted the case closed. I told him that it's already been closed... and that monsieur Choucas knows who took the money from the cash register. He blushed and stammered that he's aware of it too and that you don't have to go on with that case. And he left. What's she look like? That saleswoman, Elen. Is she pretty? OK. - Are you leaving or staying? - Staying. Why? Just asking I just wanted to see what you can do to a man who has a broken arm, a bandaged head with his mouth sewn up and looking at you with one eye. Got you. See you tomorrow! There's something else I wanted to tell you. And it's great that you can't answer. I would like you to know about it. Even if you have nothing to do with that. It's all over between me and George. There.
