(singing in foreign language) (upbeat drumming) (ominous music) - It's gettin' late, Charles, you really should go. - Just do your job, mind your business, and keep 'em comin'. (sniffing) (somber piano music) (phone ringing) - It's 2:00am in the morning, Charles. Stop calling me! (soft, tense music) (phone ringing) - [Automated Voice] Your call has been forwarded to an...

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Oh come on, Charles, let's go, man. - Wait, wait, wait, hold on. - Keep up, let's go. - Hold on, hold on. - What's the problem? - No problem. She's playing hard to get. - Oh my God, no, no, no, no, no. Let that go, Charles, a'ight? I'm surprised she ain't put a restraining order on your ass. - Exactly, that's my point, no restraining order. She's playing hard to get. - No, no, no-- - I'm gonna win her back. - After all that? - I forgave her. I forgave her. She's playing hard to get. - Hey, hey, hey, look, we got two more miles. A'ight, come on, let's go. - I'm gonna win her back. (beeping) Come on! Is your internet slow? - No. (sighing) Come on! What is it? What? What are you lookin' at? (banging) (phone beeping) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - [Automated Voice] Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. - Let me explain. It's okay, it's okay. No reason for alarm here. Let me explain, please. It's fine. - We have nothing to discus, Charles. You're embarrassing me. You need to leave. - Yes, Jessica, leave us alone. Mary, beat it. - You need to beat it, Charles. - What's this thing still doing here? - Nah, I can handle it. I'll see you at the car. - Are you sure? - She's sure, she's fine. Thank you. She's fine. Bye-bye. Okay. I forgive you. - You forgive me. Are you hearing yourself? You need medical attention, Charles. You need to stop bothering me. - I'm bothering you. - Yeah. - I'm bothering you. You took everything from me, (laughing) my house, my cars, everything, Clara, everything. And I forgave you. - You need to get out of my face. I've had it with you. And you need to learn to keep your dick inside your pants, or should I call the cops? (thwacking) (grunting) (Charles coughing) - Oh, you stupid whore! No, no, no, no, no, no! - Car's ready, boss. (suspenseful music) (phone vibrating) (banging) (gun clicking) - What do you want? - Smith awaits you downstairs. - How did you find this place? - Stop asking questions. Smith hates waitin'. - And how do I know you're tellin' the truth? - You can find out the hard way. It's your choice. Hey! Hurry up! (ominous music) - Get in. - I'm comfortable right here. - Get in before I make an example of you. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll pay. I will pay. Hey, hey, hey, come on, man, relax. Okay. Please, give me some time. I will pay you. - [Smith] Drive. - [Steven] Look, my sister is sick in the hospital. She needs medical attention. - [Smith] I know everything that goes on in this town, Steven. - What are you talking about? - Don't lie to me. Don't act like you don't know. Don't play games with me. I will put a bullet in you right here, right now. I hate liars, Steven. - I'm not lyin'. - Scumbag, scumbag gambler! - I almost had it. If I had won that game, I would've had enough money to take care of everything. - You took your sister's hospital money and you gambled that away. You're in to me plus 20 now for a half a million dollars, do you understand that? Steven, you got 24 hours to give it to me, 24 hours to make good on it. If not, you and your sister expire. Are we clear? - Yeah. - I would expect a little bit more respect than that. Let's try it one more time. Are we clear? - Yes, sir. - Good boy. Get out of my vehicle. I have business to do. (suspenseful music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - I'll meet with you. - I know this goes without saying, but I would like this done quietly. What? - Have you thought about this really carefully? - I pay you, you do the job, no questions asked. - You got this all wrong, mister. I don't do random. I kill with a purpose. I get rid of society's worst nightmares. - This'll be right up your alley. You have no idea who she is. She stole my house, she took all my money. Look, she did child porn, drug trafficking, all the bad stuff. You have no idea. She's bad. Don't let the face fool ya, dude, she's bad. - What's she look like? - Good, here we go. Here. In here, address, all the information you need. Here, here. - Interesting. - Here you go. Here. Ta-da. - What is this? - It's vitamins. I don't want her to catch a cold. Poison, genius, what do you think it is? - You suck at being sarcastic. - Look, you use anything else and it could point back to me as a suspect. I wanna keep this as quiet as possible. - I heard that part. - Yeah, I wanna it kept quiet, I know. - I want double and I want everything right now. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We agreed, we agreed half now, half when it's done. That was the agreement. - Only if I do it my way. - God damn it! Fine, fine. She gets coffee everyday, 7:00pm-ish. Might be a good time to do whatever it is you're gonna do. - Is there anything else I need to know? - Not that I can think of. The combination is 69-69. It's her favorite number, of course. Good? - We're good, yeah. - Here you go. - Thank you, I'll keep in touch. (insects chirping) (soft piano music) - Mm, that's good. (suspenseful music) (TV static crackling) (doorbell ringing) Cookies. - Sorry, I'm having a television issue. - Oh, that's a shame. Well, I see you haven't been eatin' your cookies. - Ms. Nancy, you know I love your cookies. Um, you can stay for a little while if you'd like. I'm just on the phone. - No, I've got a cake in the oven. My grandson, Cody, is going to be two years old this weekend. - Ooh! - Can you believe that? - That's so cute. They grow up so quick. - They do, you have no idea. (Clara sighs) What's wrong? - They've hung up on me, like, four times. Yeah. - Ooh, well, I'll leave you to that, okay? - Thank you. Have a good night, Nancy. - Okay, bye-bye. - Bye. (phone ringing) - This call may be monitored for training purposes. My name is Aarush. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? - [Clara] Sir, I can't get any signal on my TV. - [Aarush] Could you please verify your telephone and address please? - 2680 Vision Street, Atlanta, Georgia, 30069. 678-005-0001. - Thank you, Clara. How may I assist you today? - Dude, I literally just said my TV's outta whack. - Ooh, I am sorry about that. Give me one second. Let me check for you. - Since when did they start routing calls to India? - Give me one second, madame. - Okay, well can you hurry it up? I'm missing my TV show. - Madame? Clara, are you there? Clara? Madame? - Where else would I be? Did you hear me hang up? Can we just get someone out here to fix this? - Give me one second, madame. Let me troubleshoot from my end first an then we will see what we can do, okay? - Okay, well get on it already. Don't tell me about it, just do it. (Clara groans) - Okay, it looks like I can send out a technician tomorrow at 10:00am or 2:00pm. Does that work for you? - I work for a living, dude. - Okay, so should I put you down for 8:00am Saturday morning? - Whatever. I have to go. - Okay, great, Clara. I will put you down 8:00am sharp Saturday morning. Somebody will knock on the door, okay? Thank you very much. You have a great day. (suspenseful music) (static crackling) (doorbell ringing) - Hi. - Hi, um, cable problems? - The guy on the phone said you weren't coming till later in the week. - I'm here to fix it. - Come on in. - Ooh. (Steven mumbles) Give me a second here, I'll just get this on for you. Smells good in here. Is that Nigerian or Columbian? - You know your beans, huh? - Yeah, I sure do. - (laughs) The living room's this way. Thank you so much for caring about my carpet. No one ever does that. You think it'd be common courtesy. Cleaning carpet ain't cheap. (soft, eerie music) (TV static crackling) - Ma'am, I need to check your cable box outside. - Okay, no worries. ♪ Meet me in the garden of ♪ (TV chattering indistinctly) Coffee? - [Steven] Uh, sure. Thank you. - You're welcome. - This is actually really good. - Columbian. I know my coffee too. - Oh, nice. Did you serve time? - 'Scuse me? - I mean military. - Oh, seven brutal years in the Corps. And then I was the frontline nurse for two tours. Great times, though. I wouldn't trade it for the world. - I'm sure your folks must be really proud. - Um, my dad was. He died a couple years ago. - I'm so sorry to hear that. - It's okay. - Ma'am, um, you wanna go check your channels? Just check on 'em, make sure that they all work. - Thank you. - Thank you. (upbeat music) - [Actress] That's something else we do very well. (TV clicking) - [Show Host] Come on down! (applauding) (TV chattering indistinctly) - Check all your channels. - Okay. - Make sure they all work. - I missed my show. - I'm sure they have reruns. Hey, here you go, here's your cup. - Thank you. - Is it okay if I finish my coffee before I leave? - Yeah, that's fine, take your time. Have you ever seen this? - Seen what? - This show. - No. - You've never seen it? Oh my God, did you see... - Oh, snap! - I'm so sorry. - All right, let me get you another cup of coffee, get you a rag and clean the floor, okay? - No, it's fine, I should be going to bed anyway. What'd you say your name was again? - Sam Jones, call me Sam. - [Clara] Okay, great, my name is Clara, okay? It was so nice to meet you. And if they call, I will give them a great review on you, okay? - Sure. - All right. (laughs) Um, a drink sometime would be good. - 'Scuse me? - I don't mean to pressure you, Clara, but I think you're an incredible person. - Okay well, um, you're really direct. - I mean, just a drink, makin' new friends, just a friendly gesture. - Look, I just got out of a seven-year marriage with a psychopath. I'm not ready for anything like that. - I mean, just makin' new friends. That's the more reason why you should come out, hang out and make new friends, you know? I mean, I don't bite people, I just-- - I'll think about it. - Okay, all right, give me your number. (soft piano music) All right, thank you. - No problem. Thank you. - Yeah, sure. - I was always in uniforms, so now I like to live through my outfits. And I wear a lotta color, and my favorite color is blue. - Guess what my favorite color is? - Blue? - Yeah. (laughing) I got blue all over me. - That's funny. - Yeah, nice, nice. Let me get you some more wine here. - Thank you. - Good? - Mm-hm. - Okay. (Steven mumbles) All right. Cheers to new friends. - To new friends for real. So, what is your story? You seem way too sophisticated to be an average cable guy. - Honestly? Just pure curiosity. The whole broadband thing is amazing. The technology is amazing. My business is an NGO. - Um, what is that? - It's a non-governmental organization. We help firms determine where goods and services are to be distributed to third-world countries. Could be clothes, you know, just basic amenities. - Superman, ready to save the world. - That's just who I am, you know. 24 more hours, I retire, travel the world and enjoy the fruits of my labor. - That sounds hot. Excuse me, I need to go to the ladies room. - Sure. - Water? - I'm good. (footsteps clacking) - I'm so sorry! My bad. - I am so sorry. This time it wasn't me. - Just go sit down, sit, sit, sit. You're like a walkin' rabbit foot, huh? - Come again? - Ah, nevermind. So what happened to your marriage? - Um... - Don't, you don't have to say, don't worry about it. You're fine. - No, it's okay. He cheated on me with my best friend. I can deal with a lot, but that, I can't. He's been trying to get back with me ever since. Dude's a little crazy. (cork popping) - Why don't you get a restraining order on him? - I can handle myself. I'm a big girl. - Okay. (gentle string and piano music) Oh, shit! Oh! Oooh. (clucking) (Steven muttering indistinctly) Hurry up, wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up. (suspenseful music) Clara, wake up, wake up. So dramatic. Get your bag, get you some clothes, and let's go. I don't have time to explain, okay? Get your bag, get you some clothes, and let's go. Come on, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! Hurry, hurry, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Oooh! What happened to stealth? (Steven groaning) Hurry up, hurry, let's go. - I'm trying. Wha, what? Stealth? - I'm just thinking out loud. (Steven groaning) Don't, don't. - Who is that? What's going on, Jones? What is it? - Snap, I left my gun. - What? Your gun? - Look, I know I have a lot of explaining to do. Now is not a good time. (ominous music) (door creaking open) - (laughs) Americans. (lock clicking) - What? - [Steven] You leave your front door open? - Yeah, it's a safe neighborhood, okay? Who is that? - That's an assassin, and he's been sent here to kill us. - What? - Look, no time for this. Where's your gun? - I don't have any clips left. - Let me see it, let me see it. - No. My gun, my house, my show. - Okay, all right, this is what's happening. My sist-- - Sorry for the intrusion. I only want Clara. Just send her down here and I'll be out of here. - You have to tell me what's going on. - Okay.

Let me put two bullets in your head and call it a day, because at the end of the day I will still kill you. Make it fast and easy. - [Clara] This is really great, you know? (laughs) - You know, I didn't plan for any of this. - [Drummer] All that planning is nonsense. I've already surveyed the area. Your back doors are locked. I put traps behind your back windows, near the roof and on the ground. - Crap. - [Drummer] It's an explosion. - Oh, whatever. - Please, make my life easy and go through any one of the window. (Steven grunts) Just do it now. - [Clara] I just painted it. It's stuck. - Really? - Yep. - Great. (suspenseful music) - No snacks? (bottle clatters) My client wants your face and body to still be fine, or else I would burn this dump to the ground. Idiots. (dramatic music) (Drummer laughing) (breathing heavily) (laughing) Woo! (Clara coughing) You not gonna save her. I hear her coughing. - I'm out. (coughing) Here. - Come and grab the cash, Superman. Come grab the cash, Superman!

I was expecting something more tactical, like tear gas. Is that all you got? - I only want Clara. My client says you can keep the money. He won't come after you. (Drummer laughing) - Let me explain. - Client? - Charles sent me to clip you. - [Drummer] How do you like me now, huh? - Charles? - But I didn't. - Yeah, right. You're playing me. - I'm not playing you. (Drummer breathing heavily) - [Clara] Here. (Drummer groaning) (Clara mutters indistinctly) - Ahhh! Hurry up. (Steven groans) Hand me that T-shirt. The scissors please. - Here. - Lighter. Lighter! (whimpering) (screaming) (Steven groaning) - I'm gonna wrap it now, okay? Ready? I'm gonna watch the door. - No, no, stay. (suspenseful music) (Drummer muttering indistinctly) (groaning) - You saved my life. Why? - You needed saving. Any other doors? - No. - (sighs) Perfect. - Charles sent you to kill me, and you didn't. - Isn't it obvious? (ominous music) - I told him you must have lost your touch or somethin'. Me, I told him I don't like poison. I like to shoot. I'm a professional killer. In Africa, we used to use poison. I don't try it from now on. It's too easy. I'm a natural shooter! (laughing) Woo! I promised I would not shoot her in the face. In the face! - What are you looking for? - My other gun. I left it in the garage. - [Drummer] This gun? Why didn't you use the poison? - [Clara] Hm? - You have every right to be mad at me. I genuinely tried to know you, but let's not forget this is about you and Charles. - You two are both crazy, you know that. - Let's try to get out of here alive. - I have an idea. - What? - I'll confront him. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - That's a good idea. Eh? Come down, please. I will put away my pistol. - He will shoot you on sight. - I have my way with men. - I can see that. - What is that supposed to mean? - You could have been enjoying life and money. Instead, you got caught up in a (speaks in foreign language). - [Both] Shut up! (Drummer laughs) - Lightning doesn't strike the same way twice, does it? I got it. Is this some sort of joke or game to you? - Look, we need to focus and get outta here alive. You can shoot me afterwards if you like. - I'll keep that in mind. - Just shoot him already! Steven, the more you delay, the more it becomes worse for you. He tried to kill you twice, for that matter. You don't think he won't do it again? Think about this. (speaks in foreign language) Once a killer, always a killer. - Don't listen to him. He's trained for that kinda mission. - He had all the facts! - Look, I know this may sound crazy. My younger sister is in the hospital. She's sick with cancer. - Whatever. Is that one of your lies? - I needed the money to pay for her surgery. - You can look at the sky. (laughing) She has caught you in your lies. Oh yeah, let the fireworks begin. Let the fireworks begin! Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down! - You kill people for money to save your sister's life? That makes no sense, whatever your name is. - My real name's Steven. - I don't care what your name is or anything about your sister, okay? I need to get out of here one way or another. (gun firing) Give me the gun. - Promise you won't shoot me with it. - I will kill you with my bare hands if you don't give me that gun right now. - Can you be any nicer about it? - Give me the gun, please. - Let's plan this. - Who's the marine? - Jarheads are good at taking orders, yeah? So why don't you be a good boy and put the bullet in your brains, prostitute. I will tell him you killed yourself like a real soldier. That way he wouldn't blame me for making your corpse look ugly. - He just called me a whore. He literally called me a whore! - He's messing with your head. We need to get out of here. - You're an uneducated tramp, you know that, right? - He just wants to get, wait. He wants to get you all rattled up and take advantage, that's what he wants. - Well, then let's give him a medal then! - Mister? Let's make a deal now. Put the bullet in her brains and I'll share half of my money with you. - Leave this premise right now and I'll forget this ever happened. - You are going to regret this all! You are going to regret this all! - Give me that gun so I can kill this idiot. We have one bullet left. Now what? (soft, tense music) - Listen. We're gonna give you up first. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Shh, shh, shh! This is the plan, okay? You're gonna take that scissors, tuck it behind your back. I'm gonna walk close with you. We're gonna go down the stairs slowly. Once we get close to him, I'll distract him and you stab him. - That's way too dangerous. - We have to try. - You killed people for a living before your sister was sick, right? - So you do care. - Answer the question. - Yes, I killed bad people. - That is so messed up. I don't know who's more crazy, you or him. - If you love somebody, you'll kill the whole world to save their life. - Perception, perception. So messed up. - When I was a boy, I always wanted to be Scaramanga. All the other kids wanted to be James Bond, or the hero. I fit this job perfectly. You always go for what others can't do. - He dies at the end. - We all die in the end. I'm always the last man standing. - Yeah? Let me be the judge of that. I am not that easy to get rid of. - Yet you are in bed with your killer. - I swear to God I will blow your brains out! - Don't be blamin' you. I been a job. Nonsense, that's all you keep thinking about, blowing somebody in the heat of battle. God. You need salvation sharply. I shall work a month for you. About to get turnt up in here.

He shut off the water as well. - Are you serious? - Yes, he did. - What is wrong with you?

I'm getting bored down here. - What are you doing? - I'd rather die than be in here anymore!

We'll get through this, we'll get through this, all right? - On a given day, Clara, you're a two, maybe a three at the very most. - You know you can't have me, you illiterate piece of scum!

You know I'm a 10. - Are you taking that guy seriously? Really? - You know I give you an extra one, right? You're not that cute. (speaking in foreign language) (gun firing) (laughing) - What were you thinking? That was our last bullet. - Yeah? Well, I guess your hail Mary idea is our only hope. - The thing about black people, when they see white chicks their head goes (speaks in foreign language). I don't understand why blacks can't stick with blacks and whites can't stick with their own kind. My white clients always pay me more for my services. Black people are very cheap. So when I kill them, I piss on their corpse. I never piss on a white person's body. But for you, Clara, I will make an exception. But for you, I will make an exception. - [Steven] You ready? - No, I need some time. (soft, tense music) - So it's about the money, right? Look, just leave. I will transfer the money into your account, any account of your choice. - Serious fool. You think I be idiot.

Aren't you African or something? - So? - Will half a million things do somethin' for you? - I must live to my code. I have to kill that woman or I won't sleep. I won't have peace. - [Stevne] Look, I'll transfer the money into your account. No one has to know, I promise. You have my word. - Your word? Your word is not good enough here. You think I'm a fool? I trust nobody. There is no amount of money that can buy peace. Don't you read your Bible? Infidels. - Do you hear yourself? - Woman, shut up! When men are talking, you should be quiet. Shhh. Proverbs chapter 28 verse 21 says partiality is not good, yet a person will do wrong for a piece of bread. - Shut up! - Woo! I love feisty. - I'm ready.

Save this woman's life and God will forgive you when you die. - Where do you think you're going in the end? - Stop asking foolish question before I (mumbles) for you.

Ooh, shit! Ooh. - These people no get petrol. (phone vibrating) This has been here all this while. (speaks in foreign language) - [Jessica] Hey girl, are we still going jogging this evening? Hello? Are we going jogging? - Hi, Jess. Clara's in the restroom. She told me to tell you she'll be waiting for you. - [Jessica] She told me about you. Okay, I'll see you guys soon. Thanks. - Bye-bye for now. See you soon. Have no fear.

You should try being a standup comedian. Professional killers should know attachments are bad for business. - I'm talkin' to a fool. Ugh. - What do we have here? I see you're quite the artist, Clara. - You, please put them back! Your business is with you. I mean me. Please put the paintings back. - Would you trade your life for these paintings? I'm giving you to the count of five before I obliterate these things. One. Two. You can take your pick if you want to. I won't shoot you, I promise. - You're a piece of crap!

Whenever I wanted to think about my dad, I'd look at that. And he destroyed it. It's not going to be okay! - I'm not leaving this house without you. That's all he wants. He's crazy. He's just trying to get into your head. We're gonna get out of this alive, okay? - Right. - We are gonna get out of this.

Let me put you out of your misery. Huh? (doorbell ringing) - Who's that? (suspenseful music) - Hi. (laughs) We've been expecting you. - That's Mary. That's my best friend. I don't know what she's doing here. - Please don't hurt me! P-please, please don't hurt me. (Mary whimpering) Please don't hurt me, okay? - I took the liberty of inviting her here myself. I told her you wanted to see her urgently. Her curiosity actually put her in this predicament. How do you like my grammar, sweetheart? Oh no, she... I get that she's calling me illiterate. Oh, me! (speaking in foreign language) Definition, get out of here. Busy body, you not getting the joke? You just foolishly come. - I didn't do anything wrong! - What's your problem? You let her go now! - She's a witness. No, can't do. - What's your problem? What's your problem? - [Mary] (sobbing) Can you please let me go? Just let me go, please! Please. Please. Please. Clara! - Let go of her, you sick psychopath! - I won't rush this one. I will be patient and give you time to think about it. If not, her brains will decorate this carpet. You are an artist. I am Picasso. (ominous music) (Mary whimpering) (gun firing) (Mary screaming) (gun firing) (Mary screaming) I am warning you! You can still save her. Why would you be doing this to your friend? Is your life worth more than hers? - I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands! - Now we are talking. Now we are talking! (gun firing) (Mary sobbing) - Please let her go! Please stop torturing her! Please let her go! (speaks in foreign language) - You're very selfish. Which kind of person you be? Huh? Okay. (Mary whimpering) Is that how you beg? Let me see you beg again. I'm getting tired here. Hm? (Clara sobbing) I haven't seen this girl before. If you were a kindhearted person, you'd have given your life up like Jesus did for us. You are real mugger. (Drummer laughing) (Mary wailing) (gun firing) - I'm gonna kill you! (Clara screaming) (sobbing) (somber string music) - Look at me, Clara. Look at me. We are gonna get through this, okay? You're a marine and you've seen worse, okay? - That is my best friend he just killed. - You said I should let her go. I followed your instructions. All you had to do was walk down the stairs. You wouldn't be going through such heartache. Death is a better choice. (fast-paced drumming) - It's gonna be okay. (knocking) (Drummer laughing) - Hey, is Clara ready? - Hi, we've been expecting you. (laughing) Go there. - Let her go! - Who's there? - That's my sister. - [Steven] What is she doing here? - We were supposed to go jogging, okay? - Please. Please don't do this, please! I don't know what you want. - I told you to say something. - Please don't kill me. - Okay. Look what we have here. Isn't this a surprise? Hm? Just, just look at what God has brought to me. All my wishes are coming true. Yes, this is why you keep your phone on you at all times. Mother-snitches! - Let her go! She hasn't done anything. - All you have to do is come downstairs. I will let her go, I promise. - Clara, don't do it! - Shut up. - [Clara] I'm ready. - Give me a second, okay? Just give me a second. - [Drummer] I'm waiting! - Here's the plan. I'm gonna bring her downstairs in exchange for her sister. You can keep half the money. - Sounds like a good plan. (speaks in foreign language) I won't shoot, I promise. - I need to get really close to him. - That's the plan. - What if he shoots us on sight? - Mmm, nah. Not after giving him this much hell. He wouldn't. - Let's hope you're right this time. Let's do this. - All right. - I'm waiting! Stop wasting my time. (thwacking) (Clara gasps) (Jessica thudding) (ominous music) Tougher than you look, I will give this to you. But every good thing eventually comes to an end. Any last requests? Stop right there. - You promise to let her go. - I promise to let her go. I promise to let her go. See? I'm out. Are you hiding a pistol? - No, I'm not hiding a pistol. - Raise your shirt and turn around. Ahh. You ran out of bullets. I almost felt insulted. (Clara screams) (grunting) (dramatic music) (thwacking) (Clara thudding) (Drummer groans) I think I am tired of shooting. Kitchen knives will suffice, mother-snitches. - Look, I have three million dollars in my safety deposit box. - How will a man who has three million dollars start somewhere else? Not pay for his sister's medical bills. I told you, I only want Clara. You carry yourself joint trouble. Go. Unless you're a cold bastard who doesn't care about his family, which I highly doubt it. You love your sister. Maybe I can pay her a visit when I'm through with you guys. - I'm gonna kill you! You stay away from my family! (Drummer laughing) (soft, tense music) - I'm a blessed man. I came for one and I got five. So, which one of you will go first? (Steven groans) - Just, dude... - Hm? Where did you say the money was? Where is the key? What is the address? What-- - Look, I'd have to take you there myself. I don't have the keys with me. - You will tell me where the money is or I will kill her. - I mean, just let her go. I mean, come on, what else you want? - [Drummer] Okay. You will tell me where it is or I will kill her. (thwacking) (grunting) - Are you okay? - I'm okay. (somber string and piano music) - Are you okay? (Jessica sobbing) - Come on, guys. You guys okay? Go upstairs right now. (gun firing) (gun firing) (thwacking) (grunting) (Steven screaming) (dramatic music) (glass shattering) - Come on. (phone vibrating) - Nah, I just told you to be patient, right? Yeah, done deal. Right. Well, I mean, it just depends. It's gonna take a couple minutes, but... - Oh, babe, I'm gonna go grab dinner. - Yeah. I don't know, 15? Right, I'll see you in a few. (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) (neck snapping) Yeah. No, no, no, we're on our way right now, man. Yeah. Nah, like 15 minutes tops. Right. Nah, man. Yeah, it's gonna be all right. We gonna make it rain tonight in magic city, baby, you know that. Yeah, right. Right. Yeah, it's nice. (gun firing) Hope you know what you're doin', Steven. (gun firing) (somber string music) (engine igniting) - Close the door. - Okay. Closing. I will give you whatev... (gun firing) (thudding) (dramatic music) (laughing) (tense, energetic music) (somber string music)
