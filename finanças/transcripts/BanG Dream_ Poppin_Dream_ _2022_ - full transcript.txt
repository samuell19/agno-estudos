Can we do it really well? (Yeah!) "BanG Dream! Poppin'Dream!" POPIPAN! PIPOPAN! POPIPAPIPOPAN! PAPIPON! PIPAPON! PAPIPOPIPAPON! The world is so round It's hard to stand up straight Falling over and rolling around Before I knew it, I ran into you POPIPAN! PIPOPAN! POPIPAPIPOPAN! PAPIPON! PIPAPON! PAPIPOPIPAPON! This passport can take us anywhere Like to an island where the sea meets the sky! Take me on (Take on me) Make my dream (Make your dream) Let's come together And do what we can't do alone Let's try doing something we've never done Facing up at space, fingers in peace! (Heart-pounding dive) Poppin'Dream! (Sparkling la) Rockin'Smile! (Ready go!) Let's go after our dreams on three! (Do and mi and sol) Poppin'Style! (Re and fa and la) May the chords we play (Far away) Reach everyone out there Our dreams are poppin' around! POPIPAN! PIPOPAN! POPIPAPIPOPAN! Let's go after the things we love! Now we've done it really well! (Yeah!) We really held a concert here... Yeah. It isn't a dream. That was crazy fun. Yeah. Oh, just that you aren't complaining this time. I thought that too! Well, sorry! That's okay! I had fun too! Me too! I had so much fun! Me too! What should we do for our next concert? That was fast! Let's feel satisfied for a little longer. Oh, to be young. Masuki-San? The Budokan sure was fun! Yes, it was. Roselia, RAISE A SUILEN, and Poppin'Party. Sora-nee? I'm Sora Uzaki with STAR FORMATION. There's a music festival on January 18 and 19 next year. I want you to be there. Do you have plans? Festival? It's a charity event happening on Guam. You'll be on for 15 minutes. Who doesn't have a passport? Can you give us more details? I just sent them. Give me an answer by the 25th. U-Um... I'll provide legs, room, and board. Apply for your passports by the end of the year. That's this week. Leg room? Guam?! Wh-What do we do?! This is way too sudden! A concert overseas? I need to ask Mom if it's okay. What do we do?! What do we do?! Huh? What? We'll need to bring enough to eat. We might need to ride buses or taxis! And we need an Internet connection. Souvenirs! Diving! We don't got enough for that! Oh, come on! Poppin'Party! LOCK! Is RAS going to Guam? Huh? Yeah, we're all going to Guam. It's going to cost a lot to get there. She said we'd get legs, room, and board. Ooh! Leg room? Board? Room and board means accommodations and meals. Legs were transportation, right? Oh, really? Don't use that kind of jargon with amateurs... Wasn't Uzaki-San one of your mom's friends, Masuki? Yeah. A Shirayuki alum. She was Death Galaxy's vocalist. Death Galaxy?! Did you check the festival site? Here. "Save the Dream"? That's an interesting name. It sounds cool! Oh! Mortin! Every year, they get all sorts of major and indie artists. The profits are used to build things like schools. Sora-nee's awesome. What do you mean, you won't go?! Huh? CHU²-sama? What's wrong? Roselia won't be going to Guam. They're going to be in FUTURE WORLD FES. instead. Yes. It's almost here! Right? The contest is always so cool! Yeah. Oh right, the contest to decide who gets into FUTURE WORLD FES.? You mean it's on at the same time as the contest? That's crazy. Bushido. And that is how the cookie crumbles. Our vow, which has been since the beginning of time. Right, Rin-Rin? Yes. FUTURE WORLD FES. has been our dream since we first formed. Yes. Wow! Dream... Then you have to do that. Your dream, huh? That's lovely! I heard that Poppin'Party also received an offer. Yeah. Are you going too? Wanna go? Well, I don't mind... Let's go! I want to do it! Rimi... Rimi-Rin! Yeah. Let's go! Poppin'Party's going! Ooh! Bring some of our spirit along with you! Guam sounds so nice! Be sure to put on more sunscreen than you think you need. You won't go if Roselia doesn't? Don't be ridiculous. Everyone's so supportive. We're going to perform again! And it's overseas this time. It still doesn't feel real to me. I wonder what the stage will be like. Why don't we make a new song? Oh? Something for the festival that everyone can really party to! Rimi-rin's ready to party! Let's do it! It'll be a race against the clock. Then we meet in the basement to write it tomorrow! We need to get our passports first. I already have one. My family got them so we can visit my sister anytime. Ooh! I have my passport right now. Show it to us! Why do you have it on you? Here. Oh, so this is what a passport looks like? Hey, it's expired! We got it before you turned 12. That explains it. Two nights of towels is a lot... Won't they turn flat if you pack them now? Huh? I wish I could go to Guam too. I'll send a video of it after. Rimi, remember to change your days at cram school for that week! Okay! There. Anything else? Thanks. Thanks for letting me join the band. You looked so amazing beating the drums at the Budokan. This music festival will be another one to remember. Yeah! I'm going to go with Rokka to apply for her passport. Want to come with us? No thanks! Dream, huh? These are from my pops. Thank you so much. Have a happy new year. Say hi to your family for us. And Rei too. Yes. I hope next year will be an even better year for you. Likewise. I hope you have a wonderful year. Oh, no, likewise! Likewise as well! Likewise... Hey, we're gonna be late. Oh, okay. Happy New Year. Happy New Year! Rokka, I'm heading out now. Wait! Well, time for some more practice. You're working so hard. The festival's practically here. I can't get up there and look lame. LAYER-San! Good morning! Good morning. That's a lot of stuff. These vegetables are from Masuki-san's dad. Huh? I don't think I can finish these alone... Thanks. I didn't know if I could reach the passport center on my own. I was worried about the same thing. What do we do now? You'll need to redo it. What?! Poppin'Party! LOCK! Sis? What's wrong? You signed your autograph... Sis... I'd accept it. So what now? You need to apply by tomorrow. Arisa, come with me! Excuse me? You're both here for passports too? Yeah. It's my first time overseas. I'm so nervous! It's right after New Year's. Preparations must be tough. But it's fun. CHU² has a lot of ideas. Poppin'Party's going to write a new song. A festival song! Really?! What's a festival song? Uh... "Yay! Yay!" Something we can all do like that! That's so cute! Good morning! It's four in the morning. Just five more minutes... Ahh! If you sleep, you'll die! What's the big idea? We'll miss it! The plane! It's huge! First, we need to check in. Where do we go for that? O-Tae? You've been overseas before, right? I've never been to Narita. What? Are you serious? So you're here, Poppin'Party? Good morning! Morning. Hey. Good morning! Morning! You're early. I was too excited to sleep! It's finally time! Did you forget anything? I hope you have your passports. I do! Check to make sure. I put it right here. Huh? Huh? Huh?! You can't be serious. Is it in the basement? If it's at home, ask Asuka-Chan. Do we fake one? Huh?! Police! Found it! Don't scare us like that! LOCK-San, do you want to put your bag in? Oh, that's okay. Thank you very much. Yeah, I go to Hawaii every year. Like a rich girl?! Did you learn how to pop your ears? I'll try using earplugs. Rei. Hana-Chan! Hana, me too. Thanks. No problem. Do you two need to put your bags... Kasumi? She's been like this since she got on the plane. If you need to use the bathroom, use it now. Feeling sick? Wait, don't tell me you're scared of planes. You were jumping around like an idiot before. You always say you want to fly in concerts... This isn't good. Should we hold hands? Okay, fine. Your hands are clammy. But... We will be taking off shortly. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Don't wanna! Then get off! Don't wanna! I'm a little nervous too. Wanna eat people? Now? Ah! I forgot my airsickness stuff! I want off! What?! I have some. Rimi-Rin! Wait one second. Thank you! Do it later, you two... Argh! We're flying! Flying! Kasumi-Chan? We know that! Just calm down! Kasumi, it's okay now. We're there? We're at cruising altitude. That's a relief. Saya, beef or chicken? Do we get lunch? Kasumi, can you eat? I'll say that's a no. Would you like something to drink? We also serve alcohol. Sorry, but I'm... Rei is girl. She looks old, but she's underage. Masuki! You're not bored yet? No, it's my first time on a plane. It's like a dream. Huh. Okay. I'm taking a nap. CHU²-sama, you left your vegetables. Ah! Delicious. Oh, good. Why English? Guam... all English. There's three hours until we get there. Three hours?! A movie might keep your mind off it. They have a lot of choices. Ooh, this one! Help me! I'm going on ahead! Wouldn't think she was dead a minute ago. It's finally time! Yeah. Come on. We are girl. Huh?! Yes! We are! Poppin'Party! What? Kasumi-Chan! Um... What now? Oh! Save the Dream! Ah! Save the Dream! Oh! Save the Dream! Charity event! Oh, sightseeing? Hurry up or we'll miss the bus! Random Star isn't here yet! What do we do? It's lost. We don't have time for this! Hurry up! Come on! I wonder where Poppin'Party is. The bus is leaving. We need to check in too. We can do that for them as well. But... Ah! It left... You can't be serious. It's Guam blue. Wow! The beach! We don't got time for that! What do we do now?! It's Uzaki-San! Wait! They'll hit you with a giant bill. Huh? It'll count as an international call. I missed it... Give it here! There, we're good! Don't get too far from me while we're here. One text, call, or website without this thing, and a year's allowance'll be gone. It's true horror! You can get screwed if you connect to a free one, so be careful. Okay. Thanks. Saya-Chan! This is Yamabuki. I'm sorry I missed your call. Yes. Yes. Oh. They hung up. What'd they say? A shuttle bus to the hotel will be here soon, so get on that. What should we do while we wait? Let's take a photo! Sounds good! I want to change clothes... I came ready. When'd you do that?! I wore it under. Guam! The kitchen is bigger than my room! Sweet! Excellent! CHU²-sama, you're taking too much sodium. Did you manage to contact Poppin'Party? I sent a message, but they haven't responded. Maybe we should've waited for them? Guam's smaller than Awaji Island. They'll be fine. I wanna go beat some drums. They won't let us in until rehearsal tomorrow. No way... Do we only have the welcome party tonight? Yes. We can do whatever until then. Then... Let's hit the beach! The beach! The beach! Let's go! What? Why do I have to touch some body of water? I'll blow up a big floaty for you. Yes, coming! Oh? M-Mashiro-Chan, hurry up! R-Right. Welcome! Huh? Hi there! W-We're Morfonica. Where are we? Where'd we go wrong? Hmm... The road goes on forever. I wonder where we are. We can just go back the way we came! Well, yeah, there's only the one road, but... Oh? It's from LOCK! Morfonica? They're waiting in front of GUAM? Huh? But this island's Guam. "MA"? Other way around. The G and U are missing. Where'd they go? That's totally rich! Shiro, Fusuke, do the G and U! With your body! What? Nice, nice! I like that! Oh, that angle looks good! Nice, Toko-Chan! Should we really be doing this? A lot of people are coming to the festival, right? Famous artists are going to perform too. Is it really okay for us to go on? Hey, like, can you, like, make it more like "G!" And Shiro, "U!" G! U! So Morfonica was invited too? Yes, we're grateful to be here. Did you come in a day earlier? Things never go as planned with Kirigaya-San. I never thought I would come here with a band. Back when I used to play violin, I thought that choosing a path that one couldn't predict was absurd. And now, I'm performing in an overseas festival as part of Morfonica. It's fun playing in a band. Yes, it is. The G and U are here! Shoot! Shoot! They had a G and U! It's sparkling! It's so pretty. Here! Huh? Here! Maybe Japanese'll work better? Koko! Koko! Koko desu! Oh, Cocos? So that island's called Cocos Island? Before we knew it, we were on stage at the Budokan... Before we knew it, we were on Guam... But why can't we get to the hotel? But isn't this fun? Yeah. Well, kinda. Huh? It was really pretty. Yeah, yeah. The sea. You're pretty too, Arisa. Huh?! Let's take one together! Cheese! Uzaki-San! Crap! Maybe she's really mad? This is Yamabuki. We're on Merizo Pier. We got on the wrong bus. Really?! Thank you so much! Yes. Yes, thank you! What'd she say? Was she mad? She's going to send someone for us! Oh, good! We can finally go to the hotel! It'll take about an hour to get here, so we can do whatever until then. She's too nice. A goddess! Let's play! Yeah! Huh?! O-Tae?! Not here! Ta-da! What else are you wearing?! Nothing under this? Arisa's got a dirty mind. Shut up! They're here. Yay! Arisa-Chan, wake up. We are Poppin'Party! Is she mad? Sorry... What do we do? What do you say in English in this situation? Like I'd know! Sorry... Um... Arisa-Chan, are you okay? I'm fine! Beautiful! It really is. It's so pretty... I'm dying. Whoa... The earth is round. Yeah. It's really pretty! Thank you! Listen up. A pro's got a pro's tools. You'd better not touch them. Yes! A pro? Hurry! Hurry! These are grilled to perfection. Let's have a nice, balanced meal! This is for the in-flight meal. This is for the jerky. We made it! It's meat! Good to see you in one piece! I want some rice. White rice! Kasumi-senpai! Oh, thanks. LOCK! Kasumi-San! Morfonica was here too? Yes, we were invited to perform. Ooh! I'm honored to stand on the same stage as you, Kasumi-San. I-I'm honored too! Rice please! Looks like we won't get a word in with her. The party's for teambuilding with the volunteers too. They don't have time to talk. That just shows how many people are here to support Save the Dream. It's how big Sora-nee is. Saving dreams with music. Best thing ever! We're amping up the audience to Save the Dream! Will we be able to amp them up? Hm? It's our first music festival. What if they don't like it like our first concert? They did say it wasn't very good... Like, sure, that was kinda not great, but, like, we're better now, right? But compared to everyone else... It is true that we are less experienced. Yay! Thank you! Yay! Like, if we go up like that, we'll totally be fine. Toko-Chan, you can't speak English but they can understand you! It's no fair! That part? A festival's all about the mood! I don't know how to make a mood! Like, just have fun! It'll be fine! I can't. It's my first time. I can't. It's the first time for Poppin'Party too. Huh? It's our first time overseas. Only Rimi and O-Tae had passports. Same with RAS. My first time on a plane, and my first in-flight meal was great! They didn't have rice... How'd you end up with all that meat? They gave it to me. You can't eat it all! Why the guitar? They said "next." Huh? Hey, guys! It's your turn next! You mean to sing? Yeah! You gonna go? Next! Yay! On this road going on forever, there's one thing I'll always do If you want to change the future, then you just have to change the present You always told me to sing, but I couldn't take the first step I felt like one day I could stand on that stage if I was with you Seeing the glimmer from your eyes, my emotions started flowing I'll sing it for the future, my song Whispering never to give up, your heart That single drop of a dream falling Tells us that it will never end Breaking out of the dazzling season, I watched you as you cried Even if I can't reach you now, it'll never end, I'll keep playing this song For you on your new journey... On this road going on forever, there's one thing I'll always do I may falter on this road going on, but there's one thing I'll always do I'll chase after it, I'll keep believing, I promised, I'll keep believing It'll never end, I'll keep believing, it'll never stop, I'll keep playing this song For you on your new journey... Poppin'Party really is the best! That was, like, crazy! My heart's fluttering. I know, right?! Thank you, thank you! Party's over, pack it up. Can we put away the pro tongs? It's time already? Sorry about that. I'll take care of them. Sora-San! Um... What's the "dream" in "Save the Dream"? What do you think it is? Hmm... Everyone has the right to have a dream. I just want to make sure they do. Masuki-senpai?! I'm fine. Yoohoo! Come on in! O-Tae's asleep already? She had an early morning. We went all over the place today. Because we were lost. The sea was really pretty! Everyone on Guam is really nice. The meat was good. Whoa. O-Tae! Did we wake you? No, I was just thinking performing about tomorrow. I want to perform! You just did a minute ago. You know how you got a ton of applause? Things got across even with the language barrier. I kind of liked that. Do you think they'll like our new song too? Don't worry! It's all sparkling heart-pounding! I hope we can have a sparkling heart-pounding time with everyone who comes tomorrow. Yeah! Huh? What? Did I say it wrong? No... You always say you want to do that sparkling heart-pounding thing with everyone. Kasumi's dream is Poppin'Party's dream. Poppin'Party's? Kasumi-Chan? After hearing Yukina-senpai talk about Roselia's dream, I was thinking about what Poppin'Party's dream was. Oh, yeah, we don't have a concrete goal. But I think sparkling heart-pounding will be part of all the dreams we'll have. All the dreams we'll have? We won't run out of dreams. I feel like Poppin'Party can go anywhere and everywhere. We've overcome a lot of obstacles, and I'm sure there are plenty more in store... ...but as long as we're together... Yeah. What do you think, Kasumi? Me? I want to keep sparkling heart-pounding with you all. I want to meet lots of people and put on lots of concerts and do a lot of Poppin'Party! Yeah. Let's Poppin'Party! How do we Poppin'Party? Don't think. Feel. Okay! We're gonna sparkling heart-pounding tomorrow! Yeah! Morning. I had a nice dream. Oh? What about? Arisa?! Who goes there?! Huh? You fell off the bed. Are you okay? Thank you very much! If you're okay with that, your rehearsal's over. Oh, Sora-San! It's scorching. And it's still morning? I'm getting steamed. And it's only going to get hotter... We'd better keep hydrated. Looks like the drums and keyboard arrived in one piece. They're perfect! Thanks for sending them out here. No problem! I'll set up the instruments. Let me help. I'm so glad I could use my own. You can't go all out when you have a rental. She's a wild dog. Thank you so much! Kasumi! Okay! Then we'll go with that for the concert! Never say never! Crazy! C'mon! Crazy, right? Alright! Crazy! We're totally getting tanned. Shiro-chan's gonna get burned black? I'll only turn a little red. I'm glad our performance is at sunset. King-senpai's drumming is even fiercer than usual. Yeah... Okay. MASKING, you're not in good condition. It's just too hot. I'll bring you some ice later. Take proper care of your body. LAYER. Okay. They look so good! Rimi, they're covered in chocolate! - I'm melting... - Down the hatch! Nice rehearsal. They've got doughnuts! Ooh! They look so good! - Huh? - Yes, they do! Which should I have? Hey, where's Masu? Oh. She said she'd beat the drums some more. Oh, okay. Where can she beat the drums? Oh. Excuse me... Oh, uh... Ow! Crap... Masu?! What happened?! Nothing happened. Let's tell the staff. And the others... No! I don't want them to worry about me before we go on. Okay. But we're getting you to the hospital. Huh? They might give you some painkillers. If it hurts while you're on, that'll be a big problem. How'd this happen? Well... Come on, tell me. A sea cucumber. Huh? I stepped on a sea cucumber. Huh?! Hospital?! Yeah, they went to the hospital. Why? Please wait! What happened? Saya-senpai and Masuki-San went to the hospital! Huh?! And they left these... Saya's... Why the hospital?! The staff didn't know either. "CHU²" Masu... "The message could not be sent." Huh? Why... Don't get too far from me while we're here. One text, call, or website without this thing, and a year's allowance'll be gone. The number you have called is not in service. It's not connecting. That girl. I told her not to go too far. Saya-Chan... I'll go look for her! Just wait! Huh? You don't know this place. What if you get lost again? If only we knew which hospital they went to... Excuse me. Has any Japanese girl patient arrived your hospital today? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Thank you. Um... What did they say? Nothing. That's personal information that they can't share. Oh... We don't have time for this... We'll have to wait for Saya to call us. This doesn't look good. Maybe they're both sick? They didn't look like it during rehearsal. Yeah, they didn't. Maybe... Tsukushi-Chan? Do you know something? Yeah. Yesterday, after the barbecue... Masuki-senpai?! I'm fine. Masuki-senpai didn't say anything after that. Maybe she got hurt? No way... Hey, you girls. The doors open now. Sora-San! Hm? I see. All right. RAISE A SUILEN and Poppin'Party, can you go on without drums? Saya'll be back! I'm asking about if she isn't back in time. They'll be back in time. Whatever the case, Masuki will be back. Yes. Masu-San was very excited for today's performance. Saya will be back in time! Please wait for them until the last minute! Please. Please! The show starts in exactly one hour. Okay! We can use the drum track from recording. Can Poppin'Party still do it? CHU²-San?! We have to be ready in case we need to. More importantly... we aren't the only bands at this festival. Excuse me! Should we change the order we go on? Huh? If we go on first, that'll buy you a few more minutes, right? Right? That's a great idea, Toko-Chan! Right? Yeah! But are you sure? If we need to. I'm all right with it, but... F-F-F... - First? - Oh no... What about you, Shiro-Chan? Th-This is way too sudden... B-B-But... This is Poppin'Party's and RAS's first festival... So... So I want... I want it to go well! Shiro! Let's do our best. Yes. Yeah. I'll do it. Everyone... Thank you. Okay, then let's tell Sora-San! I'll go do that. I will go as well! Me too! Is this the free one? "Unknown Network" Huh? The festival's about to start... Saya! Masu, how's... Let's go! Up first, Morfonica! Beautiful band! Oh, yeah! Aw yeah! Let's begin. Going up first is really nerve-racking. Yeah. Our nerves would be racked no matter which order we went on. That's true... I mean that it's especially nerve-racking! Ruirui's the same, even on Guam. Then let's do our huddle! Shiro. Right. We set the stage for Poppin'Party and RAS! Let's fly into this shining world! Yeah! Good day. We are Morfonica. "Prelude to Gold." The world was just so beautiful It stole my heart on that day Every bit of sound was bursting with joy A sea of light blooming recklessly And then, a flower bloomed in a sigh (la la la) It was starting (a premonition) destiny was shouting Running heart, running heart Rush through the blue sky with stars in hand Let's make a vow to go there one day I won't flee, I won't cry, kissing my dreams In my eyes (when I close them) I can see (the gold) I'll keep moving on as best I can Together with you, I will Thank you very much. Th-Thank you. Yay! Is Masuki-senpai back? The drums... We'll go with the recording. Then we will search for Sato-San. Huh?! Ooh! Our performance is over. We have idle hands. It's unfortunate that we won't be able to see you perform. Rui-Chan... We'll find them for sure! Right? Yeah! Leave it to us! You can do it! Thank you very much! Yeah. "Loading..." "Morfonica and RAS switched spots. Can you make it?" Saya? Hello, Saya? Where are you- Sorry. Huh? I'll hang up in a second, so I'll be quick. Okay. We're on our way in a taxi. Saya! Sick? Hurt?! No, but Masu sprained her... Masu?! Is she okay?! Hurt?! Broken?! What?! Will it heal?! Is she okay?! Argh! - Will you stop that?! - Okay, now I'll hang up! Look at that! You! Now she hung up! But they're on their way! Yeah. How many months of allowance was that? Sorry. It's an important performance for Poppin'Party. Coochie coochie coo! Hey! What was that for?! We're making it in time for the performance, right? Please hurry! Next... Hm? Huh? What? Wow! Wow! Wow! LAYER-San? Sing it! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Everyone! Wow!

They gave me painkillers. But... Sorry! I said I'd support RAS, but I ended up causing you trouble. You can cause us all the trouble you want, but you'd better not make us worry again! I thought we'd be back in time. Make sure to tell us in these situations. You may not have wanted to make us worry, but it had the opposite effect! The opposite! But I'm glad you made it in the end. It isn't the same without you on the drums. Yeah. You're the only drummer for RAS, Masuki. Masuki. Sora-nee! I'm so sorry! Don't act without telling others. You'll only cause problems. Yes. The band isn't just you. Yes. Masu! Are you all right? I saw you just a bit at the end, but you were on fire! Like, totally magma? Y-Yeah. You guys... Such a crybaby. Tears of joy! Poppin'Party, the stage change will be over in five minutes. Ah! Saya, are you good? Yeah. Let's huddle! Let's all sparkling heart-pounding together! Yeah! Yeah! Let's do this! POPIPA! PIPOPA!

I've followed and chased after a dream The story isn't close to ending yet (I've always) felt you there (Even now you) still excite me Just like the day you gripped my heart Our star promise was shining As the stars rained down on over us I had a dream as I ran Our hands came together Let's join them there Our star promise twinkled As if we could touch it if we reached out (We don't know what) the future holds (Forever and ever) our voices together Let's keep our STAR BEAT going From the night I felt forever When I lost my way I hummed that first song and closed my eyes (Hey, did you hear it?) "Just keep going just like that" I wish I could go back And tell you that back then (You're always) right next to me (Even now you) never waver Just like the day I looked up to the sky Our star promise keeps turning In this always growing world Deep in our hearts, we understand each other Our songs came together That's what keeps us together Our star promise, let's make one Because we have only one wish (Sparkling) for tomorrow (Heart pounding) let's jump in I believed in our STAR BEAT From the night I felt "from now on" This dream will never end So I'll try to listen hard (Hey... Hey, you...) (Hey... Maybe you can hear it?) Our star promise, we made one Suddenly, I let a tear drop Sorry I don't know how to say this I'm seeing this dream I have I'll keep on loving it forever Our star promise was shining As the stars rained down on over us (We don't know what) the future holds (Forever and ever) our voices together Let's keep our STAR BEAT going From the night I felt forever Mortin...
