No wonder I don't come up here more often. This hill always seems endless. Nah, don't complain. It's good to do this every now and then. Hill-and-dale is always better than going along the aqueduct or around the track. I'm really working the calves here. Just keep walking. Good for fitness, good for mental health, good for general health. Three things, no downside. Just keep going and appreciate I have two legs and can walk at all, even if my knee clicks every fourth step. Use it or lose it. What do all these people do? How did they figure it out? How did they end up here in the best houses in town? What is this guy? Neurosurgeon at Columbia Presbyterian maybe? Top of his class at Yale, destined for achievement, ending up exactly where he thought he would. And these ones. Maybe two finance people. Middle-class types who went to state schools and worked a little harder than everyone else, exceeding their expectations and ending up in a house much nicer than the ones they grew up in. Everything working out just right. Living the dream. Yeah, money and success don't buy happiness, but it's got to help. The women are prettier up here. And married. I can tell a married woman 30 feet away. And up here, they've got the resources to preserve and enhance whatever got them to the top of the hill in the first place. Survival of the fittest. The rich get richer. Maybe same goes for the men. All the best ones are taken. What does she think when she sees me? That's a reasonably attractive guy? Or that's some weirdo walking in her neighborhood? Some guy who's older than her husband and less successful. Does she even think about me at all? Probably not. People are in their own heads. They're in their heads, I'm in mine. All right. Ah, I wanna be that age again. Playing sports all day long, and not have anything sore or hurt, and caring about nothing but the next game. Hey. There used to be a basket on that tree over there, you know. Fascinating fact, I'm sure. Let me see you, uh, try a three-pointer. What the hell was that? -That's close. Try again. -Yeah. I'd love to shoot some baskets. Play this kid in horse. Ah, much better. Then mom comes out and freaks that some creep has materialized to play with her kid. Man, the world's a screwed up place. Keep moving. Well, keep trying, all right? Who lives here now? Who's the kid in my old room, barely noticing the beautiful river view out his window and taking it all for granted? Living in one of the best houses on one of the best streets and not giving any of it a second thought. How come I don't know the names of anything? Roses I know. Dandelions, I guess. But so much is just... I don't know. Nice day, isn't it? Oh, yeah. Sure is. Don't you love summer? All the flowers and the trees, and everything thriving in the endless days. Yeah, great season, for sure. Are you one of the Eldridge kids? -Uh, Bruce and Tom? -Ah... Yes, Betty's boys. No, they were a few years older than me. Uh... still are, I guess. They're such handsome, talented boys. I believe Tom went to Harvard. Bruce sold us pot once. Good guy. I'm, uh, Jeff Fisher. I had three sisters, -and we grew up over on Crescent. -Oh, yeah. Yeah, I-I thought you looked familiar, but I guessed Eldridge. Have you lived here your whole life? Ah, seems that way, but after college I was in D.C., and then I was in the city for a number of years, and finally ended up back here. Ah, you know, that is the perfect way to do it. You get your schooling, and then you-- you see some of the world, and then you come back to this lovely village. Yup, I made all the right moves. You used to have a blue MG, right? Ha, that MG. You know, I think it was green. Yeah. Oh, Michael adored driving that little car. I thought it was a death trap if you ask me. " It's a death trap. It's a suicide rap." Well, we all thought it was pretty cool. Well, I suppose it was to you boys. Oh, yeah, it definitely was. Uh, anyway, uh, have a good day. - You too, dear. - All right. No way that car was green. Was it? So long ago now. This is a cute street. What do these houses cost? Gotta be a million. That one can't be a million. Can it? Yeah. Yeah. "Miss you, honey," exclamation point. "Looking forward to Grandma's party," exclamation point, exclamation point. "Miss you, honey," exclamation point. "Can't wait to see you at Grandma's party," exclamation point, exclamation point. Needs an answer today. Should I go or should I stay now? Hey! - Hey, Jeff. - Mario Andretti. What are you doing walking up in these parts? I was hoping to get hit by a car. Sorry, not a lot of people strolling around up here. Can you blame them with your driving? You, uh, playing any tennis? I could never beat this guy. When the wrist isn't bothering me, yeah. That's what you get for that topspin shit of yours. It's one of those nagging things that never goes away. That's what you get for that topspin shit of yours. Oh, the topspin shit. You still on about that? Well, you know, if you switch to a two-handed backhand, then maybe you can handle it a little better. That's a good idea, Chrissy Everett. I think you need to update your references. I think that's a perfectly fine reference. Fucking people! Shit, that's my neighbor. It's hard to get a good road rage incident going in a small town, huh? - I gotta go. - All right. See you around, all right? It's gotta be tough being the Black guy in town. Must be constantly feeling it. I don't think I've been the minority anything in my life beyond the boy sibling. Oh, man. The lady in the window, undressing as I passed by from baseball practice. Those beautiful grownup breasts. Me standing here, flooded with desire, raging hard on. Walking the same route after every practice, but never seeing that again. Ah, the feeling that day. Practically a flicker now in comparison. Maybe I oughta start taking Viagra. Ask Dr. Patel for a script or try one of Jeremy's black market ones from Cambodia or whatever. Hope it's not cut with rat poison. Can I help you? I wish. No, uh, I was just passing by. You're staring at my house. Was I? Sorry. I-- I grew up a few blocks over and I used to know the people who lived here. I didn't know them at all. Yeah, I've been here for 15 years. Oh, you're new in town. This is my house. Congratulations. Okay, then. So long. Goodbye now. Relax. I'm not casing the joint, I'm just passing through the old neighborhood. You need to stop staring at my house. I did, now I'm talking to you. We're having a lovely chat. - Move on, pal. - Oh, Jesus. Is he going to try and fight me? Should I run? Do I need to call the police? Well, I know if I saw some middle-aged guy standing on the street in his old neighborhood, I would call 911 so fast it would make your head spin. But that's just me, I scare easy. That's-- that's really funny stuff. Now, why don't you get the hell out of here, okay? In due time, my friend, in due time. No, not in due time. In due time, I call the police. How about that? You like that? You saw the house in the old neighborhood. There it is, still standing, okay? There's no need to make a day of it. You got the sense that was my afternoon plan? Is that why you came running out here after seeing me linger for all five seconds? I'm gonna give you five seconds to leave or I'm calling the police. And I'm giving you five seconds to realize what a dick you're being. Let's synchronize our watches and start the countdown. This is so stupid. Hi. Hello. See you tomorrow. I should come back tomorrow, asswipe. People are so weird. So angry over nothing, which makes me so angry. So, who am I to judge? What a day, huh? Loving it. -Beautiful. -Absolutely perfect. -Enjoy! -You too. Okay, now that's a little too friendly. Why are newer houses so awful? So dreary and alienating. What were they thinking with these things? I like the beautiful old houses. Like this one. Character. Oh, come on, Cassie. Unsure about what aspect of it, question mark. Ascot oven? Where are you getting ascot? Unsure about what ascot. Fuck! Hey, you. Hey, if it isn't little Paula Winters. -Whatcha doin'? -Just out for a little constitutional. -Is this your puppy? -Mm-hmm. She seems friendly. It's not a pit bull, is it? No, Betsy is a Cavalier King Charles. -Hey, come here. -So, fear not. She doesn't look like a Betsy. Well, who does look like a Betsy? Betsy Ross. She looks like a Betsy. -I'm trying to remember. -I mean, I-- I've actually never seen a photo. Anyway. So. Um, hey, did you hear about Johnny Pope? Died, congestive heart failure or something? Really? He's just two years ahead of us. We are getting old. Only in mind, body and spirit. Actually, I feel better than ever these days. Ah, you're one of them, huh? Yeah, yoga, jogging... eating clean. Really works. Who knew? Well, it's definitely working for you. You look more beautiful every time I see you. -She really kinda does. -Oh, go on. How weird would it be to sleep with her again after all these years? Would it seem somehow familiar or like someone new? I guess that ring on your finger means you're still married, huh? Twenty-three years next month. Congratulations. Thanks. -Yeah. -How about you? Are you still seeing that young girl? What was her name? Katie. Um... No, it didn't work out. Oh, sorry to hear that. She was really sweet and so pretty. Those golden tresses. Yeah, she was. What'd you do wrong? -I, I... -Honestly, at first I was like, "Ugh, that jerk, Jeff. Dating somebody 20 years younger. Men are so shallow, blah, blah, blah." I'm sure you weren't the only one who felt that way. No, I wasn't. But then I spoke to her at that... street fair. -Yeah. -Or whatever that was. And she was so sweet and super smart. And you seemed really happy, which is not a state I associate you with. Really? You saying I haven't been always bursting with joy? I ju-- I was rooting for you. She was a keeper. I'm sorry it didn't work. How did I blow that? No, she wanted children, I wasn't sure, just let it go. I miss that smile. That silly sense of humor. And the way she smelled. Anyone new on the horizon? -Hm? -Are you seeing anyone new? Why, you have someone in mind? -Well, not someone like her. -How about at your firm? Any beautiful but lonely associates? Maybe some with low self-esteem or something like that? Stop. You always did great with the ladies. You slept with half the girls in our class. Half? I wish. Ugh. Only a handful, and everybody slept with everybody eventually, didn't they? Small dating pool and all that. Speak for yourself. I only slept with two boys in high school. Who else slept with her? Simmons? No, Wilson probably. Don't ask her. Do not ask her who it was. Who was the other guy? I'll never tell. I'm just kidding, I don't care. Gotta be Wilson, definitely. I'm calling him tonight. Well, um, I gotta get this puppy home, and check out Jody's softball game. -Playing Dobbs Ferry tonight. -Ooh. Go Yellowjackets. Yeah, green and gold forever. - All right. - Come on. Well, I'll see you around, Jeffrey Fisher. I'll see you later, Paula Winters. Or Paula whatever your legal last name is these days. "These days." Twenty-three years. I love that girl. Liked her in kindergarten, liked her in high school, like her now. I'll like her until one of us dies and the other attends the funeral. Maybe I could start my own magazine. Tell Eric I don't need that job, I'm making one for myself. Start over. What goes on in these nice houses? Are they all happy and successful people? Nah, they can't all be. There's gotta be some depression, dysfunction, alcoholism. There was that woman on our street who killed herself in the garage. And me jealous Margaret happened to see the aftermath coming home from school, the lady slumped over in the car and the cops standing by doing nothing since there was nothing to do. Now I don't want to see something like that. I pass a bad car wreck and I avert my eyes. Look at this cute little baby. I used to have one of those. - What? - Hi. Can I help you with that? No, I got it, thanks. Thank you, though. You sure? I could use the exercise. I didn't get to the gym this morning. Or this week. Please, you'd be doing me a favor. All right. Thanks. It's an oxygen concentrator thing. I can't breathe as well as I used to. -Ah, sorry to hear that. -Yeah, do you know whose fault that is? -Whose? -Mine. I smoked 30 odd years, and now I have COPD. -You know what that is? -I do, yeah. -You smoke? -Not anymore. Yeah. I quit 20 years ago, but it still got me in the end. That could be me one day. When I was your age, I used to practically run up those steps. Now they look like Mount Everest to me. Well, uh, let me get the box up there and I'll, uh, come back and help you up too. Ah, no, no, no, I'm-I'm not there yet, but if you want, get the box up there. -Okay, no problem. -Yep. Is it heavy? More, uh, cumbersome than heavy. Those steps are like Mount Everest. Well, I'm a pretty good Sherpa, so, uh, why don't you let me help you get up there? -Oh, no, I can do it. -You sure? You're a good kid, but I got it. I love being called a kid. -Okay. -Wait a minute, I guess you're not really a kid, huh? -So much for that. -What are you, about 45? Uh, a little older. Yeah, still in your prime. Enjoy it. - That's what I tell people in their 20s and 30s. -Those were great years. -Yeah. Look, I don't like to be watched like I'm going to be dropping dead any minute. -I can make it. -All right. Take care. I-I hope the oxygen thing helps. -Yeah. Take care of yourself, kid. -All right. Don't turn around, eyes forward, let him be. God, that poor man. Someday that'll be me. I'll be wondering how it all went so fast. How I woke up one day and I was 80. Pity visits from Cassie, her seeing me old and feeble and sick. Maybe both of us wishing I'd die but neither one saying it. Well, I gotta decide something. Workin' the quads, workin' the calves, quadriceps... "Kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around." - Lungs working, no COPD, at least not yet. Fatted calf, golden goose, golden tresses... The old pond. Hockey games on the far side. Little stove in the warming shack, hats and gloves on top of it to dry. Coming here with Cassie all those years later. Her little mittens, those tiny skates, her rosy cheeks. I used to skate on this pond when I was a kid. Oh, yeah, I heard there was skating here. It seems so small, though. -Yeah, but so were we. -Hm. That shack over there was a, uh, changing area, and had this nice potbelly stove. Potbelly? Is that the right word? -Sounds cozy. Mm-hmm. -Yeah, it really was. -You have kids? -Yeah, seven-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl. You should take them skating here sometime. Even with global warming, this thing still freezes. It's actually climate change, not global warming, so... Just when I get used to one term, they change it on me. Right, yeah, uh... Like my father not being able to switch from Oriental to Asian. My daughter takes lessons at Westchester Academy, -but this might be fun too. -There's no "might" about it. I mean, there's nothing like skating on a pond in the great outdoors. -Man, I sound old. -Well, I'm from Florida, so I've never had the pleasure. -You're from Florida, huh? -Yeah. Ever seen an alligator? I have. God, I'm a moron. -Cool. -Mm-hmm. Well, uh, you should come skate sometime. You know, maybe next winter we all will. -All right. All right, take care. -Thanks for the tip. Hey. Florida seems like a weird place to grow up. Guess I shouldn't assume people from there are shallow or dumb, and she seemed pretty bright. Which is probably why she moved north. -Hello. -Hey, David. I hope you're not planning on swimming in there. -Nah, I wasn't planning on it. -Oh, good. Not as inviting as it looks. I'm not sure how inviting it looks, but I never swam in there anyway. -Why, did you? -Yeah, once, in 1979. -I will not be doing that again. -Ah, why, a lot of algae and stuff? Yeah. And snapping turtles. Watch out. Yeah, I don't want anything to do with them. I remember you skating here. I was just remembering those days myself. What's with the, uh, tarp on the shack? Are they ever going actually get around and do something with that? Don't hold your breath, the way things move in this village. -I hear ya. -I-- I wouldn't be surprised if they do it on the 12th of never! Hey, good one. That's too bad. It, uh, came in handy on those, uh, cold winter mornings. - Yeah. - Mm. I-- I-- I don't like skating. Too cold. Yeah, one of the drawbacks of it. I guess that's why you stick to the track, huh? If there's one thing you can say about running, it is not cold. Uh, how many laps you run this season? 8,654. Not bad. What's the most you ever run in one season? 9,128, in 1987. -Wow. -I-I almost beat it in 1999, but, uh, Hurricane Floyd damaged the track, and it-it was closed for eight and a half long days. Your season runs, uh, during daylight savings, right? Spring forward, fall back? -The outdoor season, yes. -Yeah. Daylight savings time was extended by four weeks in 2006, as you certainly recall. And so my annual totals have increased since then, uh, a bit artificially, some might say. Well, I won't say anything. Uh, what's the most laps you've ever done in one run? One hundred thirty-seven. Wow, that sounds like a marathon. Yeah, and then some. I suppose it is actually, when you do the math, right? Yeah. Let's just say that was a good day. What's the coldest you ever run in? How many times have I had these conversations? -And how come I never get tired of them? -That was not fun. -What's your ideal temperature? -Fifty-eight degrees. Now, most indoor tracks are 66 degrees, -as I'm sure you know. -Yeah. But that can feel very warm after 25 laps or so. -I would think. -Yeah. Do you ever run on the aqueduct? You can go all the way to Croton and then you see some nice views along the way. -Um... -You ever try that? No. Maybe you should try it for a change of pace. Might be fun and, you know, get some nice scenery along the way. Do you still have your bike? -My bike? -Your English racer. -It was red. -Oh, yeah. No, no. -I-I got rid of it long ago. -It was a Raleigh. How do I get out of this? Yeah, it was. Stop asking questions for a start. Well, I'm, uh, I'm going continue on my way. -Yeah. -Good seeing you. There might be a thunderstorm later tonight. -Did you hear? -I did not. No. AccuWeather has issued a warning. -Uh-huh. -So be prepared. I'll locate my umbrella. Has he ever had sex? Does he jerk off? To what? -I know what you're thinking. -You do? You're thinking a storm can bring a lot of rain and cause flooding, but most storms don't cause flooding in our area without significant precipitation over an extended period of time. -Well, I guess we're lucky in that regard, huh? -Yeah. Do you think the, uh, algae and turtles or whatever's in there notice when it's raining? Perhaps. We may have to call up Mr. Wilkens to get that answer. Yeah. Yeah, he would know. -He was an alcoholic. -Mr. Wilkens was? Yeah, he kept liquor in his desk and drank plenty of it between classes. -I didn't know that. -Yeah. -Interesting. -He had a problem. If Principal Gordon heard about this, he'd be rolling over in his grave. Is he dead? I haven't heard it either way. Uh, it was good to see you. I gotta go, okay? -Bye. -Okay. Bye. Bye. What kind of inner life does he have? What's going on in there? Should I be feeling sorry for him? Or is he happier than all of us? Left out or right on? Out! Out? -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure. That's why I called it out. - Looked in to me. - Excuse me? Why'd I say that? I'm not even sure. Sorry, I'm just calling 'em as I see 'em. We don't need your help, thanks. I tried. Thank you. Just a friendly game. Understood. Sorry for the intrusion. - Maybe we should replay the point. -But the ball was out. Yeah, I know. I'm just saying I have the better angle-- The ball bounced right by my feet. I'm perpendicular and you're parallel. - It's harder to see. - My work is done here. I was two feet away from it, Jenna, not on the other side of the net or up on the hill. So many lovely houses. So many well-off people. Maybe some family money easing the way for a few of them. White people passing it along. Ol' Richard. Yo! Hey. What the hell you up to now? - Don't ask. - I'm asking. Putting in a koi pond. You mean goldfish? -They're koi, Jeff. -Koi. Weren't they doing something the last time I was around? Uh, still are. God, it's endless. Delay after delay. - What is it, an indoor pool and a squash court? Uh, adding a back balcony off the master and expanding the kitchen... How much does all that cost? ...a new powder room as well, and a pantry. - Ooh, tell me more about that pantry. Mostly Vanessa's idea. Though the balcony was all me. Balconies and porches are great. Yeah. Your house, uh, your parents' house had that great double-decker one overlooking the river. Yup. Too bad we didn't spend any time on it. It's true, come to think of it. We were always down in that basement. So, how are you? How are things at the magazine? Okay. Same. Ask me again tonight. I think our, uh, subscription lapsed. I need to renew. You and thousands of others, that's the problem. Guess the software business is still going well, huh? Well, I got into the field early. I got lucky. Plus, you're smart. -Eh, more luck. -Eh, you were smart. Always worked a little harder than the rest of us, always got your homework in right on time. Anyway, I-I did get lucky. I picked the right field at the right time. You always made good choices, Richard. Is he thinking about my choices? Is he feeling sorry for me or judging me? -Which would be worse? -Do you want to come in for a drink or something? And be surrounded by more nice things? No, it, uh, looks like you're busy, and I'd rather wait to see that pantry when it's done and looking all fabulous anyway. Then you can come to the ribbon-cutting. I'll be counting the days. Anyway, I'll let you... let you get back to work here. I'm gonna move on and, you know. Sounds good. -See you soon. -Take care. Ol' Richard. He deserves everything he's got. But maybe we all do. We all deserve what we have. Look at this lovely lady. Twenty-eight, 30? Very pretty. Ooh, some interest? Say something that gets her to stop. -Hi. -No, it's what's her name! Hey, how are ya? Fuck. No wonder she's looking at me all friendly. I coached her in peewee soccer with Cassie. She's like 19. Was I checking her out? Did she see that? Oh, that was not good. I just gotta pray she doesn't say anything to anybody. But it can't be the first time some dad has checked her out, accidentally or on purpose. Why can't I tell ages anymore? What would I have done if she came on to me? "Hey, Mr. Fisher, I'm all alone at the house. Why don't you drop by?" Imagine that Sophie's Choice. I'd have to say no, and that would hurt. No chance of that, anyway. Those Penthouse Forum letters were all made up. Though you do hear about these teachers having sex with their students. Where were those teachers when I was in school? I'd have killed to sleep with Miss Lockhart. Miss Laura Lockhart. Whatever happened to her? My God, she's got to be an old woman now. Ah, look at the river peeking out like that. Man, that's beautiful. Older than me. Older than Miss Lockhart. Older than all of us. Always there, never changing. Oh, no, does she think I looped around to see her again? No, my route makes sense. She must have doubled back. Good, got a second bite of the apple here. Level gaze, eyes high, don't look down. -Hi, again. -Hi, Mr. Fisher. -It's Emily, right? -Yeah. I didn't recognize you before. - Guess my old eyes aren't as good as they used to be. -Uh, how are your folks? -Uh, they're fine, thanks. Eyes high, but not too direct. You still playing soccer? - Vague, general eye contact. - Oh, no. Oh. What, are you in college now? Yeah, I'm a sophomore at Fordham. Oh, nice. Good school. Level gaze, eyes high. What are you studying? Good, boring -parent-type question. -Anthropology and sociology. -Excellent subjects. -Mm-hmm. Uh, will you say hi to your parents for me? -Okay. -Okay, great, great. All right. Well, good to see you. All right? Well, uh, say hi to Cassie for me. Will do. Okay, good, that's got to help. Totally boring parent stuff. Now, just don't turn back to get one last look and risk her catching me. Just keep going and hope she remembers this conversation, and not me leering at her five minutes ago. She could've been 32 for all I know. These girls should wear big flashing signs, "Warning, barely legal coming your way!" Give a guy a head's up. Why didn't I sleep with every 19 year old girl I could when I was young? Took it all for granted. Typical. Would a guy like Richard be thinking about her like this? Maybe he would even if he didn't like to admit it. Maybe it's all biology, beyond conscious control. Or perhaps a weakness in character too. Some shallow side of me, all of it mixed together. -Hello. -Hello. -Beautiful day, huh? -Yes, very nice. Good to get out and get some fresh air. -Oh, yes. -Yeah. Well, uh... enjoy. Thanks. Now that's reverse racism. Perverse racism? If he were white, I'd probably just give a friendly nod and keep going. But I want him to feel welcome here. Maybe he's on to me too, thinking, "That idiot is so polite because I'm a foreigner, as if I need his empathy. Take your liberal guilt elsewhere, buddy." Though I can't imagine he's got the word "buddy" ready to chirp off the tongue. -Jeff! Hey, what's up man? -Hey, Ron. -What, you taking a stroll? -Yeah, try and walk regularly. Yeah, I gotta start exercising myself. Can't disagree with that. You look like you weigh the same as you did in high school. What's your secret? Ah, partly exercise, but, you know, diet mostly. Gotta watch the carbs. Yeah, that's absolutely my problem. You still look strong. Probably bench twice as much as me. Like that's something to brag about. You were never strong. I was faster and quicker than you. -Bullshit. -He was pretty quick. You football guys were good at knocking heads, -that's about it. -Soccer sucked. We had a better record than you did, Ron. What'd you guys win, like, two games senior year? That's 'cause Coach Connors never gave me the ball, Jeff. Billy Kipnis was his boy. Fucking bullshit. Billy was pretty good though, Ron. You're saying he's better than me? -I'm not saying-- -No fucking way, Jeff. Look, I'm... I'm not saying he's better than you, -just that he was good too. -Oh, okay. Senior year, Billy averaged 3.9 yards per carry... "And so we beat on... borne back ceaselessly into the past." ...in a clutch situation, who do you give the ball to? -I give it to you. -No fucking shit. Okay, but Coach Connors never gave me the ball. He always went with Billy. Look, all right. Game against Dobbs, right? There's two minutes left to go in the game. We are first and goal on the three-yard line. And what does Connors do? He has Marcus hand off to Billy four times in a row. -Game over. Another loss. -You should've played soccer, man. We could have made a good fullback out of you. Oh, fuck soccer. Fuck soccer, Jeff. Fuck it, you guys were a bunch of yogurts and nerds. What are you talking about? We were like all-round athletes with fine motor skills. Oh, fine motor skills, my ass. You see this? See this? Take a look at that, right there. - Yeah. Yeah. - You see that? What, you don't like him? -Oh, this town's changing. -Here we go. Townies complaining about the new people. Town's always changing. Every town is. No, it's different now. You got... Gandhi up there, and some hipster couple down here on the right. That guy with his faggoty little beard actually made a comment to my wife about our recycling bins having the wrong crap in them or whatever. He's damn lucky he didn't try that shit with me. Yeah, I can't imagine that ending well. No fucking shit. I am so sick of these entitled pricks coming in here and trying to turn the town into Brooklyn. I mean, if I hear one more word about it from anybody, I swear, they'd be sorry they ever moved here from... Williamsburg or wherever the fuck. Where does his anger come from? I mean, I don't love hipsters either, but come on. Well, my parents came here from the city. Yeah, you guys were all right. You didn't try to change the town two months after you got here. My mother sure did. Your mother probably hated her. I just gotta get the fuck outta here. Move upstate or somewhere. This isn't the town we grew up in, man. It's nothing but dickwads and whatever the fucks moving in. I'd hate him if I didn't grow up with him. Don't even want to think about his Facebook posts. It's 'cause we're old, Ron. Things change. Change. For the worse. Yeah, some things... Most things, I guess. Ah... I gotta go to Home Depot and pick up some shit. -I'll see you around. -Yeah, good seeing you, man. - Who lived on this street when I was a kid? I can't think of anyone. Oh, wait, I think that retarded kid lived over here. The one from the pool. Really messed up. Face, arms, legs, voice, everything about him. Freaked me out seeing him there. How awful to be like that and have kids afraid of you on top of it. - Hey, Jeff. - Monica. How you doing? Eh. You live on this street? Yup, bought my parents' old place. -Nice. -My eldest is in my old room, which is... is cool and totally weird. -I can imagine. -Yeah. I didn't know you grew up on this street. Where did you think I grew up? Well, I don't know, uh... some other street, I guess. Didn't you buy a place on, uh, Bellwood or someplace? Was that me? Uh, yeah, I did, yeah. Hey, but since you grew up here, maybe you remember that retarded kid, a few years older than us? What do you mean us? You're way older than me. Not anymore. At our age, three or four years is meaningless. It's even possible you're older than me now. Actually, she is older than me now, - in terms of market value. - Yeah, right. Not that my stock is going anywhere but down. But do you remember, uh, the retarded kid? -You gotta remember him. -Yeah, Ernest Milner. Yes. Scary stuff. You know my-my son is autistic, right? Fuck. Is he? Seems like a perfectly nice kid to me. -Why'd I say that? -Yes, he is very nice, and very talented in so many areas. I believe it. He seems like a fine-- fine young man. I don't know which one he is. Seems half the kids today have something wrong with them. Thank you. I'm sorry if I came off as insensitive. -I, you know, I wasn't-- -Don't worry about it, Jeff. I'm so lucky Cassie was healthy and normal. No, really, I-I wasn't thinking, and it was stupid. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. I've heard worse. I-- I gotta go. Take care. Uh, you-you too. Ugh. It's going take years for her to forget this if she ever does. It's not like I see her enough to make it go away sooner. I really am turning into my father with this stuff. If Cassie were here, she'd be mortified. Monica's got balls. She hears something offensive and deals with it. I should have said something to Ron, but I just, I can't imagine. I don't see him all that much either and I'm gonna get into it with him on the street like that? What is that? A sparrow? A thrush? Is that the kind of thing the Indians ate when they roamed these parts? God, what a boring life that must have been, having to hunt and forage all day. Nothing to read, no witty banter. Just like, what? Dreary, task-filled days and some drumming around the campfire? No pizza, no coffee, no donuts, just sparrow stew and berries. That's a nice enough house. But less nice being next one that's even nicer. Which is just the kind of sick thought the Indians probably didn't have. What would they think if they saw all this here now? Wonder? Disgust? A tear running down their cheek as they watch someone power up a leaf blower? Or would they actually be like, "Oh, cool, I'd love one of those." And what would they think if they could gaze into the future and see some dumb white guy trampling their land and misunderstanding their culture? Wait, that's a cardinal. That one I know. It's the red, uh, the fur... Hey, whatcha doin' over there, Fisher? Kenny, hey. Just saw a cardinal. -I see 'em all the time. -Nice. Mom and bros doing all right? -Why did I ask that? -They're doing okay. I can't imagine that's true. Heard the older twins had a fist fight at the waterfront, -and Mark won't leave the attic. -What about your sisters? Aren't they up in, uh, Boston or somewhere? Uh, Gretchen is, yeah. Uh, she's a doctor up there, and Elizabeth's a lawyer in D.C., and Margaret's on the Upper East Side. Great, I sound like my mother, bragging about her kids. You Fishers were smart. Well, the girls were, yeah. No, you too. Aren't you the editor of some magazine? The editor? No. There's one main one and then a few of us under him. Fewer and fewer. Workin' for the man, huh? Yup, except this man is like 10 years younger than me. I guess it's all in who you know, huh? - He's pretty talented. - Yeah. It's all about connections. What's it like in there? Mess and madness. All those boys, men now. And old Mother Hubbard, she's gotta be like 100. I wonder if it's true the dad ran off with the babysitter or if that was just some suburban legend. Hey, you still, uh, you still playing hockey? You've got to be kidding, right? No, no, I'm serious. Mr. Serious. No, you used to play a lot of hockey. Kingsley boys dominated the pond. That was 100 years ago. I'm 58 years old, Jeff. My two knees are shot. I need a new hip. You still play soccer? No, not in a long time. -See? -He's got me there. Wait, no he doesn't. Actually, you know, Michael McAdams plays on an over-40 team at Chelsea Piers, so it's not like it's impossible. -Chelsea Pier? -Piers, yeah. In the, uh, in the city. Yeah, I think he also plays, uh, at Murray's. Oh, in Yonkers, The City of Gracious Living. That's what they call it. I know. Uh, any case, the point is Michael plays hockey, and I play tennis. -Tennis. You Fishers, huh? -What's that mean? Forget it. Leave it. Uh, well, I'm gonna finish my walk. Finish your walk? Yeah, I try and take walks when I can. I walk all the time. Yeah, it's good exercise if you go long enough. Good exercise. You crack me up. What, you-you disagree? Come on, don't look so serious. I'm just bustin' your chops, man. Listen, enjoy your "walk." I will try. Kenny Kingsley, one of the town's walking wounded. There's a lot of them. Of us. Four houses down from the Kingsleys and it's like opposite world. This home just radiates happiness. Probably owned by an attractive couple in their 30s with three healthy children. A little girl who still adores her father, running up with excitement when he gets home. A future that looks bright. Totally in their prime. Enjoy every minute, folks. What is that woman's name? Does she know my name? She's one of those people I've seen my whole life but actually have no clue who she is. Familiar stranger. Ugh. Okay. Eric, hey. How you doing? Yeah, I sound chipper. Uh, good, good. I got your message before. Sorry, I meant to respond. Yes, I was very busy. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, no, I know, I get it, I get it, I get it. Yeah, don't get it. Uh... No, I do understand, you know, it's... I understand it's a demotion, that's what I understand. Yeah, no, no, I get it. You know, it's a... Yeah, I get it, I get it, I get it. No. Uh, yeah. Where does this thing go? Sorry, what? I'm sorry, say that again. What? Yeah. Oh, no. Of course, yeah. No. No, no, I get it, yeah. Stop saying I get it. Uh, oh, okay, yeah, okay, bye. Fu... Ah, man. What am I gonna do here? Oh, come on, baby. - "You don't" quote, "have to" quote, "come home," period, "but you actually kind of do," smiley face. "Grandma would be so thrilled to see you." Come on, iFuck! Fuck. Sorry, just, uh, just dealing with some... some stuff here. - Ah, what the hell. - What is your name anyway? Mistake, maybe she's a mute. No, there's no mutes here. This isn't 1930s Alabama. I'm, uh, I'm Jeff Fisher. I think we went to school together, maybe couple years apart? Cathy. Cathy... -Konecki. -Konecki. The name sounds familiar. Good local name. Well, nice to finally say hi after, uh, 40 years or so, huh? Hi. Uh, okay. I should've just let her be. It's not like I sat next to her on the train and had to make small talk. She's half mute, that's probably the reason - I don't know who she is. - Ow! There's a lot of faces like that in town. Background players, scenery in each other's lives. All right, left, right? Just choose one. God, I can't even make decisions when it doesn't even matter. "Oh, Old Man River." Why did I come this way? Oh, great. Of course he's home and out in the yard. Everyone's out today. Hey, Evan. Jeff. Doing some yard work, huh? Keen observation. Yup. -You just out walkin'? -Yeah. Place is looking good. The best I could do. No balconies or koi ponds here. Still doing the, uh, tech stuff? Why did I ask it like that? "Still doing the tech stuff?" -It's his freaking career, a successful career. -Yeah. Still doing the tech stuff. Uh, well, as long as I'm here, maybe I should catch up with Barb. Barbara! Visitor! I'm not really visiting. I just need to talk to her for a minute. -Hey, Barb. -What's up? And a friendly hello to you too. -I've been meaning to call you about Cassie and the party. -Party? My mother's 80th birthday party? Oh, yes. Right. Uh, I want her to come home that weekend, and I assumed you wanted do something with her too, -but now she's waffling. -Well, she's a college student now. Probably has things to do. She's living in a tiny dorm room in Michigan. What things does she have to do? -Who knows? -Am I the only one who cares that she hasn't been home in months? Why is she even doing a summer term? She should be lazing around here like most kids. I respect that choice. Well, fine, but, uh, she should really be at her grandmother's 80th birthday party. I don't know if there's any shoulds here, Jeff. What are you talking about? This is a major family event. -She should be there. -And I just said that there are no shoulds. Do not want her to come for some reason? -What? That's ridiculous. -She said you hadn't reached out. Hadn't reached out? I was just texting with her last week. And she said you barely mentioned the party. Asked her if she was coming home that weekend, and didn't seem to care either way. Well, I don't know why she would say that. I'd love to see her if she comes home. And did you tell her that? Did you say, "I hope you come home, and I miss you," and all that, and otherwise act like a normal mother? Jeff, relax. Don't you have chores to do, Evan? Why did you come here, Jeff? I didn't come here. I was just walking through the neighborhood, like I have 1,000 times before, passing a house I used to live in. I may have let you have the house, Barb, but it's still my town. Yes, of course, I forgot that part. This is Jeff's town. The rest of us are just visiting! You guys, you just-- cool it. There's no need to fight. It's okay, Evan. I'm fine. You don't think it hurts Cassie's feelings that her mother doesn't seem to care if she comes home for the weekend? That she'd just as soon go away or something? Is that what it is? You two have plans, and having somebody inconvenient around, like, say, your daughter, would muck things up? My plans are none of your business. I wish they weren't, Barbara, but we have a daughter, okay? And this is an important family event. Look, if she wants to come home for it, she will. She can even stay with me if she wants. She can even stay with you. That's kind of you. Don't be unpleasant. I have said she can stay here, which she might prefer to do anyway. She likes my place just fine, Barb, okay? Her accommodations are not the important thing. The important thing is that she's here for this party. -Important to you, perhaps. -Yes! -Yes, it is important to me! -But it's her life. Okay, it's important to me that my daughter come home for her grandmother's 80th birthday party, particularly when I haven't seen her since Christmas. But it's her life. She will do what is important to her. You should try and let go of it. I thought there was no shoulds here? I know it's hard, Jeff, watching her head off to college and out into the world. Yeah, it's, uh, it's not easy. Seems like she was just a baby. I know, it went by so fast. Yeah. You're a good dad. She knows how much you love her and always will. I miss her. I know how it is, Jeff. Haley's 12 now. I don't see her nearly enough. I'm sure you do miss her, Evan. If you like, I can-- I can text Cassie and ask her about the party. -Thought you already did? -I meant again. What about your plans? Maybe you two have booked something and it's non-refundable? Don't do me any favors, Barbara, okay? Enjoy your vacay. What a lovely couple they make. Two people who care about themselves more than their children. I should've fought for the house. I should've fought for the house, and for custody, and made her move into town. How did I end up marrying someone like that? What is wrong with me that I chose that person? Maybe she's asking herself the same thing. When was that great rain that sent the water gushing through here, and me and Mark Jenkins playing around in it? So much fun. Such a simple little thing. Splashing around in the stream, not a care in the world. Maybe that's what Indian kids did for fun around here. How come I'm never on this street? I must be grooved to walk in certain patterns down certain streets for some reason. But why? Oh, wow. Coach Burns! How you doing? Hey. I'm still working on my swing. Good to hear. Practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make better, huh? That it does. Nice car. Does he not remember me? It's Jeff Fisher. First base. He still doesn't remember me? I came over from the tennis team when I was a sophomore? Threw left, batted right? Hit third for you senior year. Right, Fisher, first baseman. Yeah, that's me. Excellent athlete. Good instincts. -Thanks. -Good speed, too, if I recall. Well, thanks, Coach, I was pretty fast. -A little lazy, though. -Lazy? -As I recall. -I-- What are you talking about? I ran out every pop fly and ground ball as fast as I could. You would have screamed at me if I didn't. But I don't mean in that sense. Lazy about practice, honing the fundamentals. He's right, I hated practice. Just wanted to play the games. You could've been a great player. The potential was there. Well, I'm sorry about that. You don't need to apologize to me, Fisher. I miss all that, you know, organized sports, wearing a uniform, the competition. I play in a pickup softball game every now and then. I play tennis when I can, but... it's not the same. - You were on one of the hippie teams, weren't you? You had the long hair. You ran with that crowd. I remember. Come on, a lot of us had long hair. -And we were just kids. -I know you were kids. Some of you had talent and developed it, and some of you had talent and squandered it. In my defense, I was really more of a soccer player. That was my game. I was lazy there too. Doesn't matter what sport you're best at. If it's spring and you're playing baseball, that's where your heart and soul needs to be 100% focus. Well, I'm sorry. Uh, I did love the games and-and you were a really good coach. I miss those days. Of course you do. Took it for granted, I guess. A lot of you did, but some kids got it. Those are the ones I really remember. I guess I wasn't one of 'em. You were an okay kid from what I recall. I've had worse. Just could have used a little more effort. You seem in decent shape. I do like to see that. Uh, yeah, well, it's really more out of vanity than anything else. Nothing wrong with a little vanity. You think I do 100 push-ups a day just for my health? I remember you doing those push-ups. You still going, huh? -Impressive. -Why's that? Well, I don't know, it's-it's just impressive. It's push-ups, Fisher. You get down there and do them. Good seeing you. I guess we're done. You too. One hundred push-ups. How many could I do? Let's give it a whirl. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen, that is a baker's dozen, and that is all I can do. Okay, I cannot do 100 push-ups. All right, get outta here. Go. Nobody saw nothin'. All right. This kid's never going to text back. Come on, stop looking at the phone when I'm walking. I'm going to fall down an open manhole and be trapped down there like some well baby. Baby Jessica. Fire department will take hours to get me out, and I'll be on the news, and that'll become my identity in town until the day I die. "He's the middle-aged guy who fell down a well." Manhole. Who flies a flag like that? Where do you even get one? Howdy. Ugh. Patriotism is the refuge of scoundrels. Elm, oak, dogwood. No, not dogwood. Those are the pink ones. Gotta be elm or oak. Think those are common. Bet that guy knows what it is. "That there's an elm tree, and you can use the bark to line your canoe." Yeah, I'm a snob, but screw him. If that's the look he gives a white guy walking past, I can only imagine. But maybe the look was based on my energy, the instant dislike I felt for him. We both knew we hated each other instinctively. Based on what? Cherry blossoms are the pink ones, the ones in Washington. So what is a dogwood? Guess I could ask my friend there or Google it. No, don't Google. Don't Google everything. Who lived over here as a kid? Seemed like a million miles away, whole other world. What was it? One mile away? A mile and an advanced degree away? Ooh, hipster in the wild. Workin' hard or hardly workin'? Where do I get this stuff? You know I thought this kind of thing would be part of the charm of the suburbs, but now I'm feeling differently. What, you new here? Uh, yeah, coming up on two years. You know, once the baby came, decided to make the move up. Starter home type. Probably already looking to trade up. -How you liking the town? -Oh, we love it. How about you? You, uh, you been here a while? Yeah, a native, actually. You're chattin' with me? -What do you mean? -Eh, you know, just... some around here, they see the man bun, the flannel shirts, they just, uh, they think we're ruining the town 'cause we're hipsters and bringing our Brooklyn values with us. Aren't you? You know, I don't really identify with a look or lifestyle. Typical hipster thing to say. Yeah, you got me. Screw those people who give you attitude. Man, they're reactionary fuckwads. Between the Jews, and the old guard liberals on the hill, and you hipster types, they are outnumbered and they know it. Don't worry about it. So where do you fit into this whole picture? You old-guard-liberal-hill type or something else? Uh, yeah, you know, I guess I started on the hill. Still old guard liberal basically. Since this is America and asking strangers invasive questions is perfectly acceptable small talk, uh, may I ask what you do? Yeah, web and content development. Damn hipsters and your internet crap. Nice. It's either that or some nonsense like, -"I'm a blacksmith." -How about you? Old media. Um... editor at a magazine. Oh, cool. Contracting industry, though. Contracting industry is right. Indeed. The world is yours now, fella, not mine. Well, uh, I'll leave you to your suburban idyll. Uh... Don't get your foot caught in that, all right? I'm trying my best, brother. Welcome to the village, all right? I appreciate the good vibes, man. Enjoy your day, all right? "I'm picking up good vibrations..." excitations, vibration, excitation... A lot of dead people, living the good life. Not a worry in the world. What is her story? Husband, child, parent, lesbian lover? Does she think I'm a fellow mourner or do I read as looky-loo? Graveyard looky-loo. Time to go. Large barge. Tell 'em Large Barge sent ya. Sally Caruthers lived in one of these. She always looked so uncomfortable, skittish. Was there something wrong with her? Or did she just feel out of place? Most everyone else living in houses and her down here. Wish I'd been nicer to her. I wasn't not nice. I wasn't anything at all. She barely registered. People still smoke down here. You live in this building? Why you askin'? I knew a girl that lived here when I was a kid. You know they call these the Irish flats? The what? Irish flats. I guess it was full of, uh, Irish immigrants back then. Mostly before my time. Well, uh, now we got, uh, Mexicans or whatever they are. -Dominican maybe? -Ah, fuck if I know. Don't know 'em. Don't speak Spanish. Yeah, me neither. I stupidly took French in school. Great if I ever get to Montreal. That cigarette looks good. What's a pack cost now? It's like 12 at the Arab deli, 15 in the city. That's a lot. -Yup. -That Arab place used to be an Italian deli that had the most amazing food. Can you believe that? Sounds nice. Is she dull or am I just boring her? Does she think I'm hitting on her? Am I? Or am I doing that half-ass thing where I'm sort of hitting on her, and the only way it goes further is if she invites me upstairs? Great wedges. Does she know the word wedge for sandwich or does she think I'm using my French? Tres fantastique. Pfft. -Have a good one. -You too. Well, I sure charmed her. -Hey, how you doing? -Hey. Was that a condescending greeting, like the Indian guy all over again? I hope it reads as pleasant hello to anyone I see and not "I'm a bleeding heart who feels sorry for you and your station in life." His station in life. Like I'm Charles Dickens. What is my station in life? - What's up, bro? - What's up, man? How ya doin'? And what is their station in life? Are they loving it all, drinkin' beers and chasin' chicks, and feelin' young and strong at the height of their potency? Not suffering under the weight of failed dreams and unfulfilled expectations? Or are they bitter and resentful and marking the days until they die? Or do they never think about any of this stuff? "Great," exclamation point. "Yes, I will get you a ticket," period. "Can't wait to see you," period. "Love you," exclamation point, exclamation point. The mighty Hudson, always movin'. Gotta keep movin'. Hey, Eric, it's Jeff. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, I can hold on a minute. What choice do I really have? You could put me on hold for an hour. Hey, uh, yes. Uh, yes, I have. Um... Yup. Uh, so, so I'm in. Right, yep, 25% less to stay on the masthead. Right. Right. Everything else stays the same, but just, um... less. Yeah. Yeah. No, I do get it, yeah. It-It's a contracting industry. Uh-huh. Um. Yeah. No, no, I get it, I get it. All right, uh, I will, uh, I will see you soon. Great. All right, thanks. "Half a loaf is better than none." "Bird in the hand." "Today is the first day of the rest of your life." "Today is the first day of the rest of your life..." like it or not.
