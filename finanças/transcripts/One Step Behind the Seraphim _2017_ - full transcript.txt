- Take it, take this. - Gabriel! Quickly! Lord, Master of our lives, teach us to discern good from evil... We beg You to show us the way... - Amen! - Amen! - Hello. - Pretty uplifting, isn't it? - This is my son. - Hello. Do you already know each other? In a way, during the previews. Gabriel. I thought I failed the qualifiers. - He passed last. - The important thing is that he passed. Make sure to sit near the Tudor. Because? He passed first and you last. Go learn from him. His parents brag about while you... - Speaks seriously! - Your glasses! - I don't want to, please. - Please put them on. - Is this place occupied? - No. - Gabriel. - Aid. - Excuse me? - Aid. - God bless you! - Hello, Father. Welcome to St. George's Theological Seminary. I am Father Ivan, your teacher. He's the pedagogical priest. I am going to show you the Seminar. Only for your children. The morning prayer is daily at 6:30 am. Next is the first hour of study. Followed by breakfast, with classes until 2pm, lunch, and rest until 4pm. - We can go out? - Only with written authorization. And call home? Only with the permission of the pedagogical priest. Otherwise, they get 5 days of suspension. He was gone for one night, it means expulsion. Are you already fighting over food? What is it? This is our chapel. It may seem simple, but it is a sacred place. See it as the 1st church where you will serve. The lab, in which to learn priestly rites. Priest, is it mandatory to attend all prayers? Should a future priest ask that? 10 absence from prayers means 5 days of suspension. If you are suspended 2 times you are expelled. The pedagogical priest will do the counting. Your future will depend on his record book. It will reflect your moral principles. You are here to become priests. "You are not yourselves". 1 Corinthians 6:19. A clean heart and record, they have nothing to fear. The pedagogical priest is rather rigid, but do not be afraid, I will be your pastor. I want us to be the most united class. - Do you want that too? - We do! It looks like my watch. I think he stole my wallet! Look at that brown skin. Hide your valuables! I will keep my things under the bed. Stop it now. What's yours, four-eyes? - Leave him alone! - Fades away. What is the problem? They're calling him a gypsy. And what if he is a gypsy? I'm not even a gypsy. - I'm Arab. - Is what? I'm Arab. Born in Israel. So, what are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - I'm an Orthodox Romanian. I have a right to be here. My mother is Romanian, my grandfather is a priest. I have every right to be here. I know all about Arabs. They flee their country, to escape military service, make our women pregnant and run back. - Don't talk like that. - It's true. I visit my father abroad every summer. - As if given a visa. - I don't need one. I have this. I can leave the country at any time. Let me see. - And then? - That's right, Father. Aid... Akili. - Akil. - Akil. - Lights out in 5 minutes. - What about prayer? You will pray here tonight. I can read? Tudor is going to read tonight. Let's read the shortest passage. No, if it is to be done, let us do it the right way. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Eternal god, King of every creature, forgive the sins I committed today. Purify my soul of all impurity. Most Holy Trinity, because of the abundance of your goodness you were not bored with me, you have not ruined me in my transgressions; but in your compassion you lifted me up, being in despair so that at dawn I may sing the glory of your majesty. Light up your eyes of my understanding... Mogli! You were missed, idiot. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Now and... - Go a little further. Have mercy on me, God, erase my transgression, cleanse me from my sin. Ask questions, search for answers! Discuss with each other, or with the teachers. Do not be afraid to be curious, we are here to learn. You can ask me anything. Come on, show that you are brave! Yes, you can talk. You don't have to get up. Why do you say, "Believe it and don't question it"? Good question! This is pseudo-Christian. The Bible never says that, it's the people who say it. The simplest and most logical explanation would be: imagine the truth being the top of a mountain. The path of faith takes us straight there. The path of science takes a spiral route. Because science needs proof. Both will arrive there, but we can wait for millennia. As humans, wasting precious time trying to prove what faith has already confirmed. More questions? Excuse me, how many prayers should we say a day? Morning and night, before and after each meal, plus those before and after class. A total of 10 prayers. Senior students are not going to let us bathe. Try tomorrow. We tried all week! Who is swearing? Hold this. Excuse. Get in line! Gabi, don't let your glasses fog up. - Get out of the way! - What's your problem? As I said? Enough is enough. What is it, you son of a bitch? You are lacking in respect. Wait. Stop it. I'm going to kill him. What's going on? How could you hit him? He called me a son of a bitch. What about? He will lose points, you can be expelled. Why do you think he didn't fight back? Boys... Violence has no place in our church. Talk to me, don't hit people. Father, if they expel me, it's not your fault. But it is. That's why I'm here. To fight for you, to protect you. Give it to me when one of you is in danger. You were chosen from many for that sacred mission. Expulsion is like an ecumenical death. It is like betraying your mission, disappointing God, who chose them. And risk it for bullshit? The rest can go. Killed... Pedagogical Father, take everyone, pray to God save us from the Council. Gabriel, why did it take? I went to get my technique. Sit down. Did you see him slapping? But he cursed him. - So you were there. - Was. Lastly, we can prove that there was a provocation. Write down what you saw. The rest also wrote their testimonies. It's a shame, he's a good guy. I know. So if I do that, will he be okay? Of course! My God. What about, faithful flock? Who told you? Was you? Was this the bed of the "deceased"? - Was you? - Hold it for me. Drop that Bible! Now! We can attack each other, but don't tell us off. They didn't expel him because of the slap. But why did someone write a statement. Who? - We tell what we saw. - Talking doesn't make you expelled. Someone wrote. - It was all written. - Nobody wrote anything. Assurance? What if your friend here wrote it? Take it easy. No, I was there! Are you saying we're wrong? Forget it, they are very dumb. - Was you? - Are you a foreigner? You look foreign. No? Sorry, I think it is. Come on, Olah! We're fine, man. Don't worry. We will find a way. - God bless you. - Amen. Priest! You said he would not be expelled. Of course he was expelled. But they provoked him! What difference does? You said that others also wrote statements. One was enough. You made me believe, that I was helping him. Are you asking me to be accountable, boy? Mail arrived. Tudor! - Where is he? - In the chapel. - Lupu? - It's me. - Aid Akil. - On here. - Everything. - It's in the dining room. Father, why is my letter open? She arrived like this. It's from daddy in Israel! And now? If you open that door, you will be missed. Come with me. We will explain why we are late. Okay. Gabi! Enter. Why are you here? He's with me. I'll be missed. My first. Can you believe this guy? Please, we're just a minute late. Pedagogical priest. Pedagogical priest, please. Don't give us a miss. Was anyone else late? Father, wait! For a minute? Pedagogical priest, please. It was just a minute. And now? Now? You will have a clean record. What about you? Holy, Holy, Holy, it is the Lord, God. Have mercy on us... out of bed and sleep, you lifted me up enlighten me so that I can worship Him. - Holy, holy... - Hurry up. Start with the psalms. Psalm 50. Faster. - Sister Sorin. - Gift. Leonte Radu. Absent. - Moiceanu Olah. - Gift. Have you older students forgotten the sign of the cross? The novice can do this. Voinea, wait your turn. Didn't you see that I'm here? Voinea, I haven't reached the letter V. Do you see me or not? So miss it. - You're insolent. - Gift. - The rooms are closed. - Fuck, God forgive me. Pacuraru Catalin. Lord, have mercy of the Romanian people, of the leaders of our country, of our military, and remember them all in your Kingdom. And these slaves? They are our proteges. Someone has to teach them the skills. Do you have any money? Teach us what? How to go through the Seminar. Supposing we can trust each other. We can? I will return it to you. - Are you sure? - Yes, man. What are you doing? - Now you want to skip? - I want. Do you want us to jump too? - That's right. - Let's break our legs. I've been doing this for 4 years. - Let's go. - Gabi, come. - Where are you going? - Let's go. Cowards! - Come on, Gabi. - Gabi, stay here. Stop looking like an idiot, get out. Go right before I kick you! Fuck you! Hurry up. - We are partners! - Don't make us wait. Okay. To be a priest you need to have courage. We have to lead, not the other way around. Do we trust each other? Do we trust it or not? - We do. - Great. Lesson one: don't trust anyone. Gabi! Gabi! Lying is a survival skill. Use it to your advantage. Say two things. Invent one, but convince me. - My cousin... - Really. You, convince me of a lie. - At Easter I... - Lie. Say two things and you're already lying. When you think of something, you look up. When you remember, look down. See what this beauty has brought you. Help yourself. Down your throats! 3, 2, 1, go! Pingucos! Go slowly, you still have to pay. Health. Let's go. The most important thing is that you don't tell anyone. You can't believe it! The bishop's is the same. No, it isn't. Hello, Father. Get away. See how they trample. For God and for us. God bless Our Archbishop And deliver him from evil And deliver him from evil For many years For many years to come Idiots! - Love, I'm in love! - Me too. - What is it? - Bombinhas, want one? Take it. Why does he have two? Why yes, light it up. In the next class, the Holy Trinity. - Remember, dogma is... - Theology of theology. Very well. Ready for the tests? Good guys. One more question, sit down. Is someone doing physical exercise in the bedroom? The priest director heard some noise last night. They were coming from the dormitories. Do you know anything about that? I thought we had a climate of confidence. As the most united class. Who popped bombs? Are you nceanu? - I was sleeping. - When was it? - I don't know, Father. - Lying is a sin. Vasile. Don't you dare say you were sleeping. - But I didn't hear anything. - Haven't you heard? No overflow? - None. - You must have a heavy sleep. The director heard from the other building and you didn't. If you don't hear right, you shouldn't be here. Need an exam? - Can you hear me? - I only heard voices. - What did they say? - I don't remember. Remember or the Council will consider your case. Maybe... "Give me one, Dorneanu." Dorneanu! Get up, shameless creature. You hide like an animal when you're involved. You should be ashamed! Who else was in it? Say it at once! Dorneanu, tell me so I can get rid of the Council. - Aid was there. - Aid, get up! Your grandfather spoke well of you, you rat! - It was a joke, Father. - Do you play popping bombs? Who else? Don't pretend you don't know! Nobody else. - Are you lying to me? - Gabi! - No, Father. - Yes, it is. Are you lying to a priest, Aid? It is like lying to God, or to Al. I'm a Christian. - Do you have anything to say, Dorneanu? - No, Father. Who was the third? Who was it, boy? Speak soon! It was me, priest. I was the third. Thank you. Did you think I didn't know? I know everything! Your trash! Sitting down like a lamb. I wanted to see how far I would go with your lies. You three, out. The rest, write a statement about what happened. You said you would protect us! I cannot protect liars. Out! Come soon! Start writing. "Declaration". Me, the writer... Put your name. "At around 11:15 pm", after Olah Constantin told me... - It's not their fault, Father. - Write what I said. - It is not fair! - Look who's talking. Gabriel, I'm just after Olah. Write and the three of you will be safe. - But I don't want to, Father. - Are you serious? Your colleagues have already framed you. So why should I write this? Because I only want Olah. You want to be a priest. Don't miss it for a guy like Olah. - No, Father. - Think of your parents. Dorneanu and Aid also depend on you. Do not waste your dream of priesthood for Olah. I can't, father. All of you will be expelled. I hope Olah is worth it. Isn't the main feature of the church forgiveness? They set off dangerous fireworks. Dangerous? They are children. This is not a place for children! You forgot that I am the director. If we don't expel them, my authority will be ruined. Calm down, please. Sit down. Two of the three can be very useful. That. Dorneanu Stefan's father is director of Rom Silva. His mother manages RomMedicom. Maris Gabriel's parents also own a business. Our school has needs. So now it's about money? Arabic is useless. But we cannot expel him alone. Priest! Do not say that I did not save them. It was a bloodbath. Thank you very much, Father. I said they would forgive us. Of course, I will pass. Tell your mother that I left my shoes under her bed. - They were expensive! - Okay. Wait a minute. Yes of course. It's gonna take a while? He's talking to the mother. He's a mommy's boy, but he can wait with us. - No, thanks. - Okay. Your boots are beautiful. Thanks. Very well, then. Listen, my credit is running out. Yes bye. Where are you going? Leave the girls alone! Gabriel, Olah is waiting! Dorneanu, I want to talk. Wait. Don't be stupid. Expect to come to you. Do the girls come up to us? I'll show you. It's fate, I was going to call you now! - What's your number? - You stupid gypsy. Hi, I was talking to you. - Are you sure? - Have. - Are you still busy? - Just a little more. But you can wait with us. - We are in a hurry. - It won't be long. - You blinded me! - Put on sunglasses! Let's use another one. Hi. Thanks. What else are you forbidden to do? First, we shouldn't be here. We shouldn't meet girls, without kisses... As well? You cannot kiss three days after communion. When was your last communion? Ivan! Gabi! Gabi! Ivan is here! The pedagogical priest is with him! What do you want, Father? Sincerity, please. Where are the seminarians? I don't know customers that well. - God bless you. - Your blessing, Father. Does it make sense to ask about seminarians? Do you see any seminarians here? 6 glasses for two girls? Dorneanu! Come here! Come here fast. Mr. bar owner, Dorneanu Stefan, seminarian. I thought about introducing them. Where are the others? Say it. You will face the Council. go back to school! Why did you let them in? We should work together. Father, they bring half the profit from the bar. This is no place for them, cigarette, alcohol, girls... You call, I come and expel you. I don't... If I come here every day, won't you go broke? What if my guards prevent you from entering? Raducu? I christened his son. Raducu, how is the boy? God bless you. God bless you. Good game? When she takes off her shirt, don't be staring at the breasts. Go kissing the belly near the navel until you get in your pants. Or the skirt, depending. Take it out slowly, whisper something beautiful... Then go to the panties. A little bit complicated. Go taking it out very slowly, while distracting her. Once you're distracted, take it off. It starts with two fingers. It keeps the river running. - The river? - Excite her, make her wet. Rub a little. With it wet, take off your pants slowly. Keep it distracted, all the time, all the time looking at you. Or with eyes closed. you put it, gently. Come in and out, come in and out. When it's almost... You know. You must think of dead horse, rats, anything but sex. - You can't have sex with Bianca. - Stay quiet. Idiot. You have to remain a virgin until you are ordained. Who will know, besides him, she and God? So if a girl asks, do you have sex with her? No. Of course yes! I've done it more than once. The priest will ask if you are a virgin. I'll tell you what he wants to hear. What is the meaning of confession if you lie? If she asks you to have sex, what does she say? "No, I have to go to confession."? - Hi. - What about you? Got rid? They should be fasting! Fuck fasting. Good Morning. Are your parents at home? I ran away from the mass. Ivan was giving a sermon. Why are you so quiet? Good Morning. Quick, Maris! - What happened, Father? - You'll know. What did you do last night after 8 pm? - I was in the dorm. - No, step by step. I left class around 9 pm. I went to prayer. Then I went to the dorm and... I fell asleep. Remember if you saw Olah in prayer? Look at me, Maris. - I think so. - And then? We went to the room, talked. Did you hear that, Olah? It's everywhere. I said I was in the TV room all night. I have witnesses. Why did Maris lie? To protect me, but you don't have to. - I didn't steal the book. - I'll prove it. Stole the log book and marked his absences as "justified". But it was stupid. Because you don't know that the priest has two books. At night, he transcribes everything in the second book. Where do you think I found the differences? At least if I had done it in both... Father, this is not what this is about. That is not why he hates me. Olah. God can punish you for getting that girl pregnant. Stealing and falsifying means expulsion from any Seminary. Okay, Father. Voinea stole the book. Yes. He modified the records. I just watched. Voinea, your brother says you stole the ledger. Olah was with me. We stole together. He just wants to get away with it. He did that! And he cut those tires in front of the bishop's residence. You were with me. We did everything together! - You smoked in bed. - Shut up! - Play pool for money. - Shut up! For what? For me to take the blame alone? - You destroyed us, you idiot. - You are an idiot. Father, please, this is the last year. You will not see us again. No more convincing as a beggar than as a priest. - Remember what we discussed? - What, Olah? That I would sign anything for anything, even if you don't know them. This is beautiful. We will take a tour of the Seminary. Remember what my mother promised. I believe in God! Sir... Can't you do something? Say you know something, you better not say it. If you say, don't write, if you write, don't sign. If you sign, you are doomed. And you. Let me explain? Let me explain? Explain what? - You fool. - I'm sorry. - I swear to you, man. - You threw us out, not them. "Don't be bored alone". Let's get bored together. Pathetic. Which is! Have you seen their style? "My name is Raluca". I'm a 17 year old lion. I like the band East 17 and I want to meet a handsome guy. What the fuck was that? Our advertisement stands out. But I write to them often. How long has it been doing this? Has any girl answered yet? They will go. Or you place an ad and let them respond to you. I guarantee you will have at least 10 responses. - More than 20! - That's right. Do not put your face, we will find another one. - God bless. - God bless you, Father. Sit down. Are you studying or sleeping? Father, look at these "cones". We should be faster, even the good guys are here. Aid, Maris... Andrei, I heard you don't like our food. - No, I don't see a problem. - I heard you were petulant, - who threw a plate. - Slipped. If you hate the conditions, why do you stay Why doesn't Tudor complain? An exemplary student. No grades below 8, no faults. Don't bring him bad luck, Father. An exit request? A big disappointment. Do you think you deserve favors? I was kidding, don't tear it up. We can make an exception. I don't want anything. Great. Anything else? Yes! I propose to abolish the study class, it's a waste of time. As well? Those who don't need to study they only bother others. Right. Any other ideas? Yes. Permission to leave in the afternoon. We allow it. No. Only if the pedagogical priest is in a good mood. Do not meddle in this. It doesn't depend on me. - It is the Council that decides. - I'm a member. But if I'm not wrong, students are entitled to a representative on the Council. Isn't that right? How are you? - What's going on? - Never call or write. I've been busy. Ivan continues to piss us off. Let's walk. Where? I have to be on the call list. Okay. - I'm serious. - Okay. Want a perfume, new shoes or going out with a girl. I'm very happy for you. But you are here because nobody would lend you money. This is Banco do Pobre, stop complaining. The poor man's bank with 50% interest? It is "poor" not in the sense of helping the poor, but in the sense that you desperately need money. 20%? Live off your fucking student aid. 40%? Andrei, get him out of here before I do that. Okay, 50%. Now we're talking. What will be the guarantee? - A walkman . - Stick it in your ass. I speak of golden things and things like that. You already have a guarantee here. And then? If you are late, I will sell it. The priest is the most influential in the community. Decide what to buy or sell. - And the renovation? - It's easy money. You can pocket some costs. Can we sell a tombstone twice? Yes, with the help of the Church Council. If you control the Council, controls the church's revenue. You can justify any expense. Do not talk about it with anyone. 633. The girl's postal code was 638. There are many desperate women. - Don't be nosy. - I will choose. Wait a minute. We can make money from these cards. - Like? - Go away! All those girls want to talk to the Alex we made up. We can tell each one that they were chosen. What do we gain by that? We say that Alex wants to spend New Year's Eve with her, but she needs to send a guarantee. They are not going to send money. Think about it. Maybe not all, but at least 100 will ship. It's still a lot of money. For a non-existent party? Now you. Attention, please. The Council granted your request. The study class was abolished. They can go out once a day at noon. Who is our representative on the Council? Tudor Alexandru. Very well. We rehearse. - There is no more study class. - Leave him alone. - Come here with the adults. - Don't bring him here! - He's our friend. - Our friend? I dared to speak and he is on the Council. Because he is a snitch. Guys, let the past stay in the past. You are stepping on my foot. - Am I a nuisance? - Yeah. Get out! Gabi, Aid! - Andrei! - Stay with us. - What? - Look here. In the name of the Father... Come on, Dorneanu, come on! Put the music down! We're auctioning off pretty girls! Good! Antonija, beautiful, 25 years old, from Bucharest. 100 contos, will someone give me 200? Bucharest, beautiful, 18 years old, blue eyes. 100 contos! 15 years, for 200 bucks, anyone? We will release them for free! Are you crazy? Idiot, this money is ours. Fuck, for free! It has a defined abdomen! Drink beer. What happened? The idiot drank until he was unconscious. And did you let him drink that much? He wanted to compete with me on the drink. - I'll call the pedagogue. - Wait. Take him to bed. We can deliver it. No. Gabi, think. Not like that. We don't tell, Aid. Fuck, he would snitch on you. - He's not breathing. - What? He is not breathing. Tudor, Tudor? Where are you going? Go there. Nobody leaves. Get him up. - Watch out. - Hold his head. Make room. - Tudor! Wake up, Tudor! - I'll undo it here. Tudor? - I'll call an ambulance. - At the seminar? - For alcoholic coma? - Do you want him to die? - Get him. - Slowly. Wait a minute. He pissed himself. - Let's get him back. - He's just drunk. Now he is drunk. What if he dies tomorrow? Come on. He's heavy. Fuck it, Dorneanu. Caution! Shut up. - Where's the ambulance? - Around the corner. Stand up. From now on you will pray standing up. Gabi, if your parents could see you... - I'm a little nervous. - You have no reason for that. - What if I stutter? - You won't stutter. Will be all right. Ready. - How to say? - Thank you. Really. My dear... - We are gathered here... - No, again. - My dear... - Again. With more passion, with joy. Try again. - My dear... - No, listen to this. My dear. Try again. - My dear... - No. Gabriel, convince them with your words. - I can't convince them. - No? How did I convince you? Father, let him speak. Do you think it's better? So try it yourself. - My dear... - No. You. - My dear... - You. - My dear... - I'm sorry of your future parishioners. Gabriel, listen. Put your heart in it. My dear... Tudor, what happened to you? Should we take him to a hospital? Tell us, we are on your side. - My dear, we... - No, no, no. Gabriel. Put your soul into words. My dear... Try now. - My dear... - No. My dear... - My dear... - No. Look directly at their souls. Take a break and then... My dear... Try it. - My dear... - No. Idiot. If you tell the Council that, you are gone. There is no council meeting. The director was fired. As well? Father, what happened? Someone spread rumors. We don't scold anyone. Pedagogical priest, what about prayer? - We wait for the director. - Didn't he leave? Priest? Priest! - God bless them. - God bless you. Since today, I will be the director of the Seminar. I'm sure it makes them happy. First, some changes. It will be mandatory to attend study classes. They will no longer be able to leave without permission. Now the prayer. I said the prayer! In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. Our father that is in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done... Dorneanu, where were you? No, come in, you can come in. Don't make me call you again! - Tell me about Banco do Pobre. - What bank? Don't play the fool. Usury in my Seminar? Speak, Dorneanu. Admitting things is halfway to forgiveness. Who forgives the other half, Father? - What are you doing? - Stay quiet! What is it? Why do you need a lighter? - For the candles. - Filter candles? - I don't smoke. - Liar without shame. What lights up with this? And don't say candles! - Rivers. - Is that so? - When did you see one? When? - What? - Yesterday in class. - Truth? Tudor, how long have we been without cages? Since the summer. What is the lighter for? For the stove. - You? - That. Since when? When it's cold and the guard can't come, I light it. Show me how it lights up. Come on, show me how it lights up. Come on! Absences will only be excused by the school doctor. - But it never happens. - Of course, you need to be sick. As Christmas approaches, your confessor has to be from our school. - This is not fair. - Isn't it fair? - He's going to tell the Council. - Are you that sinful, Gabriel? - That's my problem, Father! - Is that so? The sins are the same, regardless of the confessor. - Then I won't confess. - Is that so? - Suspension of 5 days. - Who said? I said. Tudor, make a list. I will see who does not confess. Dorneanu, should I bring a Cerium? You know what, Father? We'll talk when there's something concrete against me. Otherwise, I am innocent until proven guilty. Did you hear that? Did you hear? Until the contrary is proven? Is that right? Tudor, the list. Yes, Father. - Idiot, come here. - Tudor. - Let's go to the lions' den. - He's not going to report Ivan. - Want to bet? - I want. Who else do we have? - He gives severe penances. - Fuck the penance. - Fuck it. - Gabi, come back here, Gabi! - Do you have a better idea? - You will lie anyway. - Then why confess? - Idiot. - Fuck it. - Stop! He is the Archimandrite, he is not going to report us. Come on, Gabi. We have to be together. He's not going to tell Ivan, believe me. After confession... What do you have in mind? What? Did you commit onanism? It's a serious sin, boy. How could you do that? Don't do it again. How long have you been falling into this sin? Do not do this again. What other sins afflict you? What? Higher! - God bless you, Father. - To you too. Gabriel, remember, you won't confess to me, but with Christ. There are three priests here. If you lie, you lie to Christ. - I won't lie, Father. - Clear. I will not lie in a confession. I allowed you to choose any other confessor. I know that. What sins do you want to confess? Good... I skipped class. I stuck to the evidence, I didn't fast. Do you drink or smoke? - Yes. - What else? - Problems with my girlfriend. - Your friend? No, with my girlfriend. My partner. Have you sinned in thought or in action? Both. This is serious for a seminarian. You can only be ordained as a priest if you're still a virgin. Well, that's what happened. What other sins afflict you? - That is all. - Is that all? Don't you have anything else? - No. - How about lending money? If it's a sin, it doesn't bother me. Is it really? Tell me who's involved. - Half the school, Father. - Was it Aid's idea? Mine and other students. But you cannot tell the Council that. I can't? It would be breaking the pact between the penitent and the priest. This would show that you do not fear God. You sold letters from girls to students. Yes, some. - We donate the rest. - You call it donating? Some less fortunate they don’t have a chance to talk to the girls. - It was a good deed. - Was? You can't tell the Council that either. Confession is worthless without repentance. Yes, Father. Read the Virgin Mary Acatisto all year round, every day. Attend Masses every morning and night. And they won't be able to take communion for a year. Can go. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. You can withdraw. - Priest. - God bless you. Is this from the school doctor? - Why the surprise, Father? - Me, surprised? Where is Gabriel? He's been missing a lot. I don't know, outside. What do you want it for? For the register of the pedagogical priest. God bless you, Father. MEDICAL CERTIFICATE I see you were very ill. - How it feels? - Better, thanks. I can still smell the alcohol. The calligraphy and the signature look good, but the fingerprint and the stamp are fading. Therefore, it has already been used about 3 or 4 times. It's from our doctor. I need to present this to the pedagogical priest. My parents started going to church after they met you. Same? They are in the church now and you are here. It really is. I don't want to be a priest's wife. Nobody is asking you to be. I thought you would become one after graduation. We are still far from that. Why do we keep this up, if we don't have a future? How is it? Do you want to finish? It was fun, wasn't it? You go in one direction that I would never go. Is that serious? Are you ditching me? Do you know how many girls want me? Go after them then and get out! Dorneanu, cut your hair now! - I'll cut it after the holidays. - No, it's for now. Stay tuned, Dorneanu. I want it to be exemplary. I don't want you to say, "Credo, what hairy priests!" Speaking of vacations, starting this year, you will go to practice in the village church. It is a period to rest. You will rest when you die, smart guy. It's for training. Without training it implies not traveling to another country with the choir. Let us pray! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. If not the future priest. Be welcome. - Hello, Dad. - Mrs. Maria, He has already prepared his bed and technique. We are going to present you a wonderful mass tomorrow. Do you feel cold? - You shouldn't. - Please, Father. - Come in for a drink. - I'm sorry, but I need to go. Here is some bread, sugar, olive oil... - Thank you. - Lets go in. Thank you for your donation. Go to Mass and listen to the priest. You won't need a lot of money around here. - Thank you. - Strive. Bye. Holy is our God. Holy God Holy and Powerful Holy and Immortal Have mercy on us - You can continue smoking. - I wasn't smoking. I also smoked when I was your age. Priest? Why have you kept the parish to me? I've known your father since I was a child. When I came to this village, I was your age. My wife is buried behind the church. My son lives in the city, at his decision. I was already satisfied with what was here. They say that once, a bishop visited a village like ours. He stopped at the priest's house and asked him: "Father, how is life here"? "Very tough", your grace," said the priest. "The faithful are few and poor". So the bishop gave a prayer book to the priest and said: "Don't despair", this will answer all your questions. And gone. The bishop returned after some time. He asked the priest: "Have you looked at my prayer book?" "- Yes, Your Grace." "- And how's life?" "Somehow, worse". They are less people, and poorer. I buried an old woman last week. The Bishop asked: "You didn't find any answers in my prayer book? "That's right." "Go get the book." Then he opened the book in front of the priest. Between the pages there were hundreds of dollars. "Priest", considering that he lacked faith, including to open this book, I'll get it back. Turn around as you can. If you don’t want to become a priest, there's no problem. But if you want, decide what kind of priest you want to be. We will. Gabriel. Where is God? Where can we find Him? It's like a phone booth. Good... He's everywhere. Oh really? So he must be very discreet. I don't know. Yes, you do. Look for him here. And without a doubt it's more glorious Than Seraphim You who, without spot, You carry the word of God The true mother of God We glorify you In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as it was, in the beginning, now and always. Amen. I knew that our choir was excellent, but I didn’t know it was so good! Congratulations! The Council decided... Come here, father. Please read the decision. The following students were expelled: Sorin Eftime, Radu Mihut and Dorneanu Stefan. Excuse me? "Until the contrary is proven", isn't it? Among all, why me, priest? Am I the only one with the dirty record? - No. - So, why? Priest. If I had known, my father would have prepared any present. This does not work for me. I will readmit you. During the meeting today. But assume you bribed Moraru. I don't believe you. Do you give your word of honor? Word of honor. Lord, have mercy on us Testing, one, two... - God bless. - Mr Moraru, welcome. I was checking the new sound system. We had problems with the acoustics. God bless. - Nice watch! - It was a memory. - The last memory! - How's the agenda? Interrogations and expulsions. I heard some things. - For example? - You will know. I will not give statements. But I will. We know that if one falls, it will be a dominant effect. Wait. Lonel, are you using you to get me? On the contrary. Don't cry, friend. Look at me. Come here. Gabi. Take care. - I'll close the gate. - Get out! Gabi. Gabi. Wake up. - What is it? - Wake up. - What time is it? - Five in the morning. Why are you dressed? I'm going to Germany. I got a medical certificate. If you ask, I'm sick at home. Aid, wait a minute. Where are you going? Germany, get money for one person. I will earn a good portion. Right after Dorneanu was expelled? - Don't worry. - Aid! We don't need money. Well, I need to. Cover me for two or three days. I promise that when I return, we'll be fine, i will pray... Cover me, right? Are you going to do that? Why the hell did you let him go? He needed the money. What should I do? When will he be back? - Let's ask at the bar. - He's not coming back, Gabi. Run! Open the gate. Gabi, go over there! What are you doing here? Gabriel. Gabriel. Why are you so sweaty? Did you have a nightmare? What happened, father? What happened? You will see what happened. Why are you panting, Andrei? I feel full of vinegar, do you have the flu? - Stop pretending. - What is it, Father? You will not deceive me. Everyone get up! I told you to get up! Who saw these two coming? What are their coats? I saw that door open. Who opened it? Who? Nobody will say anything? Did we get to that point? Are closest branches. Now cover for these two? Father, can you close the door? There's a draft. Close? Do you want me to close on the outside? What an audience yours. Bribes from your parents will no longer work here. - Whose bed is this? - Aid's, Father. Where's Aid? He's sick. He has a medical certificate. Wait, Andrei. Go back to sleep. We got rid of it easy, Gabi. - Father, would you like to see me? - Where did you say Aid was? At home, he is sick. Is it really? Someone here disagrees. Where is my son? - I thought you were home. - I went to his house. - 150 km from here? - That. Distance is nothing for the sake of your students. When was the last time you saw him? - I don't remember. - You eat and kid together. Go to the bathroom together. Spare me that. Maybe he's in the hospital. He will prove it with a medical certificate. We both know it's not true. I can't make you speak the truth. If Aid gets kicked out, it's your fault. - Why? - Because it doesn't tell you where he is. Ma'am, I told you he wouldn't say. Look, I'll be outside. Maybe it'll refresh your memory. Please, I know you want to cover for him. - Please tell me where he is. - I don't know. I beg you, trust Father Ivan! Only he can help you. If the Council expels him, his future will be ruined. - Father Ivan is not going to help you. - Please help him. I thought you were a friend of Aid's. I am! That's why I can't tell. Please help him. Please. See if it helps the Bishop again. Come on, Aid. Grandpa, everything will be fine. Do you dare to speak? I don't believe that. Aid! I didn't say anything. Closing the gate. Meatless cabbage rolls, cake without egg, apples. - Do you need anything else? - No. - Any dirty clothes? - No. Where are your uniform pants? - Up there. - Stupid bastard. - What did he do? - See his background. I sympathize with the teacher. - Who? - Father Ivan covers you. I don't believe in the audience you have. What about absences? The bad grades? Is that how a future priest should dress? Tudor would never dress like that. Adopt Tudor then. Get yourself together. Soon you will be a priest. - Maybe you don't want to be a priest! - What? All the work, the amount of money. - That was all I needed. - You chose this path. Me? Listen. If you are expelled from the Seminary, don't even think about coming home. Where is your father? Still with Ivan. My history of conduct is chaos. At least he was not expelled. I know, Gabi, but... You don't know my father. Look, together we will end Ivan. - Stop hitting him! - No! - Leave him alone! - Get out! - No! Stop! - You brat! - Stop! - You'll get what you deserve. You will see only! - Priest! - Don't you know how to hit? Quick, Andrei is being beaten by his father. - I'll talk to his father. - He's bleeding! Andrei knew this would happen. You're saying that because he's my friend, aren't you? Yes, here the statement, "I, Andrei Cazacu, bl bl bl bl bl, I declare that Gabriel Maris blew up bombs in the dormitory. " Most recently: "Aid Akil went to Germany." On here. "Dorneanu got drunk." There is nothing new. Olah... And another, another... Look how many they have. Look how many. All signed by Andrei Cazacu. - It can't be. - Why is he your friend? Andrei was not spoiled like you. But... Tudor... It wasn't Tudor. Wait, where do you think you're going? Do as I say or you will be expelled from the Seminary. I can transfer. High school exams, you may not receive a diploma... While there is much to be gained here. Come here, Gabriel. Come with me. I could have thrown you out many times, why didn't I? Because I believe in you. After graduation, I can ask the Bishop to give you a good parish. - If I snitch? - Not your friends, the others. That Andrei's father is an animal, that Professor Muraru betrays you... Didn't you know? Yes. Did you think he was covering you? I wasn't. I will not write anything. Why do you think so badly of me? You blackmailed us, Father. Don't believe me. But if you believe in God, you will see that I am only protecting the Church. You can laugh, but the Church has many enemies. Both inside and outside. How can we protect it without information? Is that why you kicked Aid out? Aid. There you come again with Aid's. Aid has his business. We have our own Church. Cultists and spies from other religions threaten it. Aid was neither a cultist nor a spy. Gabriel... Imagine our Church 20 years from now. Left in the hands of your drunk and stupid friends. Would you still fear God? I'm listening. - Not much happens. - Are you all saints now? - It is difficult to find out so soon. - Are you wasting my time? Some fourth grade boys... They correspond with girls. - There were letters. - What letters? Letters with detailed descriptions of... Sexual relations. The guys brag about the cards. Priest? Keep watching. - Priest. - I ordered to keep watch. "When I finish", I like... You can read the rest yourself. Unfortunately, these guys succumbed to lust. They even boast about it to their colleagues. - Their participation is good. - I say to expel them. - By letters, we can't. - Yes we can. - To show that we know everything. - This is cool? Tudor, shut up. This is epidemic immorality. Confessors know what I mean. There is so much sin. They steal easily. Money, cameras, clothes, food. They even stole the Tudor Bible. The Bible! It wasn’t at a train station, it was stolen here, at a seminar. A Bible! This is... a perfect argument for our degradation. What do the cards have to do with it? We are too soft! They are not afraid of us. We have to get those rotten apples out. Let's vote. Pedagogical Father? I will not vote for the expulsion. Raise your hand, Florin! Pedagogical Father? Florin, sit down. What's going on? Florin! Well, your vote? Lord Muraru! Thank you, students will be expelled. God bless you, guys. - Father Ivan? - In person. How can I help? I am the lawyer for the expelled students. How is it? The parents are suing you for abusive expulsion. Abusive? Confidential correspondence. Article 195 of the Criminal Code. - Any proof? Witnesses? - We have the cards. The witnesses are the members of the Council. Priest! Didn't they? No. It's hot. Tudor and Maris. The rest, leave. Out! Stop looking, get out! Get out! Very well. Nonsense, but very well. It was your fault, Father. What was your goal besides expulsion? - Whereby? - Whereby? An alcoholic coma, for example. Did you think I didn't know? As for Gabriel, his file is full. - Father, give them a break. - Out! Shut up and get out! And then? Father, you can no longer threaten us. Get out of here now! I already said go, get out of here! Are you deaf? Get out of here! Get out! Am I talking to the wall? Get out, I said get out! If you break the rules, you will be expelled. Prosecute me if you want. - Bosses make the rules. - We'll see. Your grace, I didn't know... Please continue. Gabriel Maris, did you tell Father Ivan about the letters? I did. Tudor Alexandru, was there when Father Ivan read them? - Was. - These are immoral letters. - The trial will decide. - Guys, wait outside. Let us not forget our objective. With its shameful machinations, these two boys they disgraced the Seminary and me. - Please kick them out. - You have no evidence. These statements confirm that they are not worthy to be priests. Your own abuse has disgraced you and still insists on it. Now are you blackmailing us? Do you see that? Those who still think the priesthood they are not won by blackmail they vote yes. Thank you, they were expelled. Guys, please go out They will testify at the trial. There will be no judgment. - There will be in the press. - We'll take care of that. Guys, you can go out. Gabriel. I have a question for you. Why did you enter the Seminary? To become a priest. I wanted to learn how to help people. To find God. To help them find... peace. That's why I came. Thank you, wait outside. Go to the uncle to pray. Quick, fast. You too, Andrei. Gabriel, put on your technique. You too, Tudor. But... They're going to be late. Pray for me, a sinful and unworthy servant... to get out of my sleep and enter your home. Sir, hear my prayer and with your sacred power let me praise you with a pure and humble heart, so that I can climb up to...
