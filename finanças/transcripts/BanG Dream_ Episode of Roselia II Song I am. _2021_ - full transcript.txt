I breathe the air, taking in the gentle scent Of the eternal flower always blooming by me The essence of it all, that we stand here shining Showing the world our bond, our moment of greatness Such a lovely and warm emotion In the eternity which we create together I will sing forever to show my love So long as we walk on, the path will unfold before us The reason this world shines so brightly must be Because we have embraced music so deeply Into a future which leads to the pinnacle We will continue on our path No matter where it goes BanG Dream! Episode of Roselia II: Song I am. Yukina! Yukina, do you have practice today? Yes. I'll be home before dinner. Where's Dad? He pulled another all-nighter. He locked himself in his office and won't come out. It sounds like he'll be stuck in there until the end of the year. I see. Thank you. I'm going to school. Yukina! Morning! Good morning, Lisa. Did you study for the quiz? I did. You'll be fine. Just remember what we went over yesterday. We can review it during lunch. "Autumn in the Park" Isn't this the place where Hagumi invited us to see the autumn leaves? That invitation was quite the surprise. Inviting everyone to go because Rimi was recording a video letter anyway? That's so Hagumi. It seems the best time to see them is now. Who told you that? Sayo did. She didn't look all that excited, but she totally is! Kayaking lessons... Sending your feelings with a postcard... If only I didn't have work. I'd totally go. Maybe I shouldn't go. Huh? We need to decide on our set list. Gotta make it something "us," right? You don't need to think one up right now. Seeing the leaves'll be a good change of pace. Oh! Yukina-san! Lisa-nee! Good morning! Good morning. Morning. Good morning. Minato-san, good morning. Good morning, Mitake-san. Oh! See you, Sis! See you. Rokka, Asuka! Morning! Morning! Wait up, Hina-san! Safe! I was certain we'd be late for sure today! That early morning shoot sure was fun! The bell! Okay! Lots of people get this part wrong, so pay attention. It's always on every test, so you'd better learn it well. Sorry, Ako. You've almost got the tempo on the double-time at the hook. O-Oh, okay! And Sayo... Huh? Could you maybe try coming in a bit earlier? Yes. I don't mind. Huh? What's wrong? Why the looks? I'm sorry. I thought it was unusual. You haven't given us many directions in the past. Didn't I do it a lot? From my perspective, you would typically try to hold a middle ground. It seemed to me that you would hold back your own opinions to prevent conflict. Lisa, you've changed. I mean that in a good way. N-Not you too, Yukina. I feel like I need to do something. I did write the lyrics, after all. Am I asking too much? No. You should have the most concrete image of what this song should be. We're counting on you, Lisa. O-Oh, I think I'll go get some drinks. I'll join you. The usual for you? Yes, please. And you, girls? I'm good! Me too. Okay. Rin-rin, Yukina-san, look at this! What's this? "The contest is in 27 days" A countdown app! "The contest is in 27 days" See? It counts down! This is interesting. It feels like something is coming. I know, right? I want to work real hard for the contest, so I look at this to pump me up! I like your attitude, Ako. Thank you! But our goal is not the contest. You need to understand that. Right! We need to put on the coolest performance at the contest and go to FUTURE WORLD FES! Let's practice as best we can. Yeah! That's why we're taking a break from NFO! Oh, are you? Yes! Oh, we're taking a break, but we're still logging in. We're trying to play less than usual. Once the contest is over, let's go on that new quest! Yes, let's do that. Oh! Then this is a countdown until we can play NFO again too! Ako, do you understand how important this contest is? I-I do! I'm just kidding. Hey, Yukina, Ako, what's up? Fighting? No, we're not. I was just... Really? Sorry! Lisa-nee was so into practice today! Yes. Today's practice was very fun. We've had a bunch of goals, and we keep finding new things to shoot for, but FUTURE WORLD FES... Will we reach our goal for real this time? I don't know, but together with you, Yukina-san, Imai-san, and Hikawa-san, I feel like we can't fail to reach it. Yeah! Roselia's unstoppable! The five of us make us! "Make us"? I don't know how to explain it, but something like that! Yes. I understand what you mean. Oh? Really? The five of us make us... Rowing is harder than it looks. Ushigome-san, please be careful not to lose your balance. Right! Ran-ran, Minato-senpai! One, two! One, two! Minato-san, you're a little slow. That's too fast! Rimi-rin! Oh, Hagumi-chan? Happy! Lucky! Smile! Yay! The scenery is beautiful reflected on the water. Yes. The scenery itself is very beautiful. Kayaking was fun. Thanks. It was my first time, but I'm glad I managed to paddle properly. You mentioned that you came from morning practice? That was a real surprise! Girls Band Challenge? Yeah. There are a lot of preliminary concerts. Got that for you! Thank you, Hagumi-chan. Ushigome-san, does the video for your sister meet your expectations? Yes, the videos you took are so different from mine. They're so fun! I'm sure Sis will love it! You look very happy too, Sayo. D-Do I? I'm so glad we came out to see the leaves! Me too. It made for a very good change of pace. All these new experiences have ignited my creative spirit. W-Well, me too. It'll be inspiration for flower arrangements and songs. Sending your feelings with a postcard... Are you interested? Yeah! I wanna draw a postcard to everyone in Hello, Happy World! Me too! I want to draw one for Sis. Let's do it! Let's all draw postcards to send our feelings! I'm done. A single red leaf? It's very simple. You drew falling red leaves? Yes. It turned out better than I thought. Ran-ran, you're good at this! N-No, I'm not that good. Everyone's drawings are so nice. Who are you sending yours to? To myself. Wow! That's so cool! FUTURE WORLD FES is rapidly approaching. Our experiences define who we are today, so I thought I would put my feelings in this moment into words. Yes. Perhaps you could call them messages to our future selves. I wrote mine to everyone in Hello, Happy World! Who did you write yours for, Ran-chan? Th-That's a secret. What? Come on, Ran-ran! Quest complete! Good work, Ako-chan. I'm so glad I had Dark Walker... Yes. Having that light on the ground was really helpful! But we would've lost without you, Rin-rin. Thanks! We've finished all the quests so far, so next is... We only need to clear Dark Plus difficulty. It's for level 100 and above, right? We're way over that already! Yes. Let's do it together after the contest. I can't wait! Yes. I guess we'll have to wait for the update. Should we call it a night? Going to bed already? I'll be up for a little longer. Then can we talk a little longer too? Huh? Rin-rin? Actually, I'm writing a song. Wow! What kind?! Is it super cool?! It's not that kind of song. I thought it might make a good practice song. A practice song? Yes. I wanted to do something for Roselia too. Let me hear it when you're done! I really wanna hear it! Okay! Thank you, Ako-chan. See you tomorrow. Okay! Good night! A song! Rin-rin's so amazing! As for me... Waiting for an update, huh? That's kind of like Roselia right now. The quests we have left are the contest and Girls Band Challenge and FUTURE WORLD FES... After those are done... what'll happen then? We're getting an update, right? It won't end after that, right? "The contest is in 9 days" Ako! Bath! Okay! What's my next quest going to be? Yukina! Morning! Good morning, Lisa. Did you pull an all-nighter? I was thinking about our set list for the contest. Then it was morning. "LOUDER" is the song that made me who I am today. We need to do "Promise." We need a song to do after that. "Student Council" "Practice" Shirokane-san, are you ready? Yes. There are eight days until the contest. We need one more song. I got it! Rin-rin wrote a new song! Ako-chan! Don't you mean she's writing one? It's done! U-Um... Is this true? Y-Yes, but I wrote it as practice... "Practice" It's a good song. Rin-rin! Yes! This song'll be a big hit at the contest! We can't just leave it as a practice song. I can't agree if it will make the set list inconsistent. We don't have much time to practice, either. I think the melody is very good. I suppose it depends on the lyrics. Ako-chan said... Hm? She said that the five of us make us, and a melody played in my head. It is worth a shot. Let's think of the lead-in for the song. Th-Thank you so much! Then let's do it! I think that should flow smoothly into our new song. Yeah! I thought so too! And you, Yukina? No issues at all. It will be part of our contest set list. Wow! Are you sure? Yes. Thanks to this song, I feel like I had a faint glimpse of where we should go next. Rin-rin was amazing yesterday. Can I move forward too? My quest today is to make the transition from the second to the third song really cool. Okay! Are you ready? Yeah! Yeah, I think we're way more in sync than last time. We may be too in sync, in fact. I'd like to focus more on amping up the audience. You're right. It's a contest, but there is an audience. We should make their energy part of the show too. So the audience can enjoy it too. FWF will be even bigger than the contest, so let's perform with that as the goal. Yeah. Ako-chan, what's wrong? I-I'll practice real hard to make the crowd go wild! Ako-chan? "Miracle Drummer Snappy-chan" I'm home. Hey there. The deadline for the Snappy thing is tomorrow. You want one? Tsugumi said she'd give us the postcard from the one at the cafe. "The contest is in 4 days" Ako? Sis, does your band have, like, goals? What makes you ask that? I don't know what I should do after the contest and FWF are over. I've always practiced with those as my goals. Ako... Lisa-nee and Yukina-sanâ€”everyone's practicing really hard and moving forward. They must know what's beyond the goal. But I can't see anything. What do I do? Can I really go on at the contest feeling like this? Hm... Let me think. We in Afterglow don't have a cool or concrete goal. Making every day the same as always is our goal. While every day changes, we keep a part of it same as always. That's what we decided. I think the worst thing is for the band to waver, so I think of what I can do. I think it's important to find your own role. That comes before playing good or bad. What's my role? Sis? I had a pretty hard time figuring things out for myself before I found my role. Think about it long and hard, and you'll find your own answer soon enough. My own answer... The Roselia everyone's trying to reach... "The contest is in 4 days" When will I see what that is too? Rin-rin... What should I do? This is fun. I've had to practice more than ever before, but it isn't a burden. Ako-chan... Hina, you should knock much quieter than that. You were focusing really hard, so I thought you wouldn't notice. Coming in! What do you want at this hour? I can go see you at the contest. Are you sure you should? Yeah! I promised you! It's an important day for you, so I made sure my schedule was free. Do your best! Thank you. I intend to give it my all. I have no intention of losing. You're gonna go on FUTURE WORLD FES! Yes. That is why we've run for so long and so far. Dad, another all-nighter? Yeah. This weekend will be the clincher. You've been practicing diligently lately. Yes. The contest is upon us. It's that time again? Dad. We are definitely passing the contest. I'd like you to come to FWF. I'd like you to listen to myâ€”to Roselia's music there. I told myself that I wouldn't go until you invited me to go. I'll go see FUTURE WORLD FES. Do your best and make the best music. Thank you, Dad. Tomorrow is the long-awaited contest. Let's have a restful night in preparation. Yes, thank you for today. Thank you for today. Yeah, thanks. All right, cleanup time. Here, Sayo. Thank you. Yukina, put the mic stand in the corner. Okay. It's happening tomorrow. Doesn't it feel so weird? By this time tomorrow, we'll have our ticket to FWF. We'll be an "us" that we've never seen before. "The contest is in 0 days" 18 hours and 32 minutes until the contest... Ako-chan? Huh? What's wrong? Worried about tomorrow? When you said "an 'us' that we've never seen before," what kind of "us" is that? I've been thinking about it. When the contest and FWF are over... Once we've reached our goals, what does Roselia do next? What'll happen to us? Ako... I still don't know. Huh? Thus far, we've aimed for goals which were easy to put into words. We had a beaten path and simply had to walk it. But that path is about to end. I am proud that the five of us could reach a point where we can't see the future. Yukina-san... The contest, and after that FWF. Those are certainly goals, but they are not the pinnacle. Our journey will continue beyond them, just like the game that you two play. B-But Roselia isn't a game! Quests don't just appear out of thin air! We need to find them ourselves! I don't know what we're going to do after this either. I don't think anyone here has a clear vision for it. But for some reason, I'm not worried. If the five of us stick together, we'll find one. And with you and Rinko around, we'll be okay for sure! Why? You and Rinko have always listened to the music that the five of us create. You reflected on what Roselia is. Without the two of you, we would have gone our separate ways after SMS. You two showed us the way back to our path. I believe that you two are most able to view Roselia with unchanging eyes. That is why, when we find ourselves lost while forging our own path, you will need to remind us, what is Roselia? And I want you two to guide us there. O-Okay! I'll never lose sight of Roselia! When we get lost, I'll save us! I promise! Walking a path in the dark is scary, butâ€” Oh, I have Dark Walker! Dark... what? In NFO, a skill that allows you to see paths in dark areas. You sure know the game, Sayo. I'll do my best! Together with Rin-rin! Right? Y-Yes! None of us can see the path forward. However, the promises we make with others will make us stronger. That is what I believe. Yeah, I think so too. So this promise'll make you stronger too, Ako. Lisa-nee... Everyone... Tomorrow, we take first place in the contest. Yes! "The contest is in 0 days" We're on after the next band, right? Yes, that's right. On that note, Ako, has that countdown already hit zero? Oh, I turned that off yesterday. Why would you do that? Because Roselia's going to continue even after the contest and FWF. I'll make it continue. That's why there's no reason to keep a countdown. Ako! When'd you grow up so cool and awesome? Did I? The dark powers sealed within the depths of my soul... of my soul... um... Boom! Roselia, please stand by. Oh, okay! The time has come. What do I do?! I'm getting nervous! You're not going on, Ako-chan is. Hey, you're shaking too, you know! Hey, Roselia's on next, right? Tomoe, you need to relax. We're here to cheer them on. I know that, but, like... Ako's been worried about something lately. Really? Yeah. A new age will begin for us after this. Let's go. To meet our future. Entry number 12, Roselia! We are Roselia. We started in a scene where music was flowing. We can move forward with that scene in our hearts. "Promise." There's a place I'll never relinquish to anyone I grew stronger each time I did away with my excuses Flower of life Blooming in the sunlight Flower of life The white clover will be reborn one day Into something unshakeable The path that we walk may have more suffering than happiness But even so (oh) that's fine (oh) I'm walking beside you I'll breathe life deep into the scene of our promise As we walk on this path into the future (Beautiful) Until it shines on the throne (Magnificent) Until that day, I won't let it end The next song will be our last. This song was born from the words that will light our path into the future. ""UNIONS" Road." We took one step forward, and then took another That was how, together, we created our future When we were born, we were frail and fleeting But we believed we could be lasting and strong Donning promises with one another And casting aside our doubts Moving from one goal to the next We walk on, to the pinnacle which we seek We will be proud that we each could reach this place With each one we reach, we forge our path Wow wo wow... Wow wo wow... Ako, you were the coolest ever! The audience was totally into it! We put everything that we could into it. Yes. I think so too! The contest is important, but I can't wait to put on something even better for FWF! For some reason, I didn't feel nervous at all. All that's left is... Yeah! In second place, Magnolia! As you know, the top three bands get to perform at FUTURE WORLD FES! Just like last year, we had some very high-level performances this year. I'm getting the shivers. Me too. But... Yeah! Roselia was the coolest band up there! And now, the first-place winner of the contest! It's time. Let's believe in ourselves. The winner is... entry number... 12! Roselia! That's us! We have managed to accomplish our goal. Did we... really win... the contest? We won... We're going... to FWF! We did it... We did it! We did it, Rin-rin! Yes. Yes! We did it! Roselia, would you please join me on stage? The audience is calling for us! Ako! You're the best! Here are your Deluxe Chocolate Parfaits. It's so big and fancy! I don't think I can finish eating this after that dinner. There's always room for dessert! All right, here's to a win! To our victory. It's good and sweet. Right? Let's keep going so we can celebrate with another parfait. Yeah! Rin-rin, let's take on Dark Plus tomorrow! Yes. We can finally play it. This is supposed to be a postmortem. Come on, it's been a good day! You're right. Then perhaps I can bring this up later. Huh? What's that? Don't leave us hanging! A new song? Yes. I'd like the lyrics to be something all five of us can agree on. Now that the contest is over, I think it's more important than ever. Minato-san... Oh, Yukina-san, if you don't eat it quick, the parfait will melt. That parfait was so good. What's the matter? Rin-rin? You worried about it alone. Huh? I didn't realize that you were worried before the contest. I'm so sorry. It's okay! From now on, I'm going to guide us! I'm here for you too. Each of us in Roselia may be weak alone, but all five of us face in the same direction... We have the strength to move forward with our pride. I'm sure we're stronger than any other band. The five of us make Roselia. For me... for all of us, Roselia is something that gives us strength. So... We can't ever lose it. I won't ever let us lose it. Rin-rin... That's so cool! Thank you. I've been thinking about what Imai-san and Hikawa-san said about promises making us stronger. So I wanted to make a promise with you, since we've been friends for so long. Rin-rin, I love you! A-Ako-chan? Let's do our best so we can both guide Roselia! Even after FUTURE WORLD FES is over! Yes! Sis! Hina?! I've been waiting for you! In this cold? I wanted to tell you before anyone else! Congratulations on everything! You must be so happy! Yes. Thank you. FWF's next, right? I'm definitely, definitely, definitely going! Promise! Promise? Yes, let's promise. Oh, right! I got a cake to celebrate! Let's eat it together! A cake... Yeah! Let's have it. FUTURE WORLD FES is right after New Year's... It's getting kinda cold. Does that cat live around here? Come here. I won't bite. Remember how we used to play here a lot? Sessions? Yeah. You'd sing with your toy mic. And you would beat your tambourine. I switched to a bass at some point. Oh. Hey, now. Well, she's gone. Shall we? Yukina? Yukina, what's wrong? For the longest time, I thought music was all I had. That all I could do was sing. Do you still think that? I no longer face the past when I sing. But I still think that all I can do is sing. What I must do as part of Roselia is to sing with pride. Yukina? Well, we're home. See you tomorrow. Night! Good night. From now on, we forge a new path. A new path after surpassing my dad. A path only we can forge. A path of blue roses. Our new song for FUTURE WORLD FES? Yes. I've thought about it too long. I've lost sight of what it should be. I want to present the "us" that we felt at the contest. Putting form to feelings which exceed the imagination is very difficult. Remain calm and collected. Build on your experiences and move forward. That was what I wrote on my postcard to myself in the autumn. Mine arrived at home as well. I need to execute the plans that I construct. I am responsible for myself. These demands on myself have often been burdensome, but Hina says that that is my strength. When she saw my postcard, she said that I was my own best cheerleader. I realized that there are some things you only realize when others tell you. So perhaps you should ask someone for their opinion. Sorry, I'm gonna stop by the roof before joining up. Okay. Don't be late, now. Mitake-san. I knew I left it here. Mitake-san. Minato-san?! Why are you here? I called your name several times. You didn't hear me, so I followed you. Oh, uh... Sorry. I wanted to ask a question. You mean to me? To get to the point, I'm having trouble writing lyrics. You mean for FWF? Yes. I used to never do anything that I didn't want to, but I decided that I'd do them for the things that are important to me, and I did. I'm talking about flower arranging. And now, I want to do it. Is that how it is? You can talk to people and ask them for their opinions, but in the end you have to choose what you want to do for yourself. Choose for yourself? Ran's always got her feet on the ground. She must have a firm grasp of herself. I see. Perhaps I believed that guitar was all that I had, so I chose a path where I had to improve at guitar. It was a choice I made to prove myself to Hina. Sayo-san... It was difficult at times, but my relationship with her is much better now. I felt like I was obligated to play the guitar, but that has changed, and now I personally want to play the guitar. I wanted to play together with all of you. I find it difficult to talk to people. I wanted to change as well. That is why I chose my path. I'm the same as Rin-rin. I wanted to play with Yukina-san. I wanted to be a super cool me! That's why I chose my path. It's the same for me. I chose the path of following Yukina. So basically, I chose to pursue music together with you. Singing is the only path I have. I want to sing about my pride in being part of Roselia. If, thus far, we each chose our own paths, and that led us to come together... We will choose our own path after FUTURE WORLD FES and continue on it. We choose our path for the future... That's so cool! Isn't that a good idea for our next song? It very well may be. Our next song will be different from any song we've done before! What do you think? The lyrics are even more piercing than usual. The path we forge from here is our choice. Maybe keeping that in mind naturally resulted in some piercing words. Oh, maybe that's why the lyrics sound like a continuation of "LOUDER." A continuation of "LOUDER"? Yeah. "LOUDER" has been a foundation for Roselia since we first formed. I think this song will be like a foundation that shapes us moving forward. A song that connects the present and the future. It's true that I thought that while writing it. Then perhaps "Neo-Aspect" is a song that connects the past to the present. Hey, why don't we play those three songs in that order? The old us and the new us. We can show them all of it! Yes. The key shifts should be very smooth as well. That's a good idea. All right! Let's practice hard and make the best performance ever! "Don't look back. Move forward." These are the heights that my dad wanted to reach. The heights that we wanted to reach. Today, it will become the heights that we surpassed. Can I make a suggestion? In a few hours, we will plant our first step on a new path. That is not something to take lightly. So the song which made us until now... I want this to be the last time we perform "LOUDER." What?! B-But "LOUDER" is your... It's very important to me, and that is why I want to choose to end it. The song will always live within me as my beginning. This is a choice that I want to makeâ€”for us to make as Roselia. This choice will take us to even greater heights. I agree with your choice. Sayo... Minato-san wants to distance herself from something so personal to her in order to grasp a more concrete future for Roselia. That means I need to meet her resolve. Because I am part of Roselia. I don't know if that choice is a good one... but I believe in Yukina-sanâ€”in Roselia! So I'm sure that this choice is the right one! I also believe in Yukina-san and in Roselia. We fold the map on our past selves and take a new step forward! Okay. I guess even songs can fulfill their purpose at some point. Let's do all the songs we're doing today at full power! Naturally. Every member of the audience will remember Roselia for all eternity! We are Roselia. On guitar, Sayo Hikawa! On bass, Lisa Imai! On drums, Ako Udagawa! On keyboard, Rinko Shirokane! And our vocalist, Yukina Minato! Okay? This was a very important song to us as Roselia. With all our gratitude and resolve... "LOUDER." A dark betrayal brought my downfall My whole world was destroyed My heart torn apart, and my passion lost Even now, my weakness is on my mind Embracing my immaturity I no longer had a right to sing, so I turned away My eyes had lost their light But with simple words, you lit fire in them Louder! You're my everything (You're my everything) Your sound always shone so bright With my sound, I'll try to show you that I'm movin' on with you (movin' on with you) I want you to know that I'm here right now because you were there No more need to cry, I'm sure Feel alive... This brings the five of us to the present, and Roselia into the future that we chose. "Neo-Aspect." The dazzling beauty of life Weaving together a melody Giving birth to a path Believe me this is the right way Where has the light gone? I reach out my hand Trying to find it, but my hands grasp at nothing Unable even to breathe My frozen lips Fall into silence Into (darkness... darkness...) I feel (loneliness... loneliness...) Your voice... The moment I touched the depths of your heart (Find a way... Find a way...) I know (loved one... loved one...) Let's join our hands together once more Even if you feel frustrated, or feel pathetic Or you need to cry, I'll be here I'll open the door for you I hold you... Beautiful prouder So, beautiful braver So, beautiful brighter Full of my pride (I want to sing) Ah... on stage Sing away! Sing away! We'll charm you with this new us Wo wo wow... Wo wo wow... Wo wo wow... Wo wo wow... Wo wo wow... Wo wo wow... The next song will be our last. Our newest song, "Song I am." It was born from a twisted beginning But while this world crumbles down Gotta make it happen (Gotta make it happen) Without hesitation, I devoted my entire self In order to make something of it Gotta make it happen (Gotta make it happen) As I struggled and fought (Wow wo wow) I found my real reasons to sing (I am song.) In the past you made me who I was (I am song.) From now on, I'll choose my own path For our own future as us, together (I am song.) No looking back, no hesitation, only forging ahead Shout to the top! Incredible... That was an incredible performance. Everyone... Thank you all so much. Like... Like... You're the best! It truly... It truly was the best performance we have ever put on. It was so awesome! Oh, what am I supposed to say?! It was... It was so totally awesome! My heart... is full! When I was singing, I felt more clarity than I've ever felt before. The light is our future. I saw us facing into the future with our song. It was so clear to me when I was standing on the stage. I... Until now, I played in order to produce my own sound. From now on, to put my pride and strength into it, forever... I've finally found it! My own "cool"! I want to keep believing in my feelings, to keep my faith! That's what "cool" means to me! I want to... keep playing forever. That was the sound... of my courage! My own sound came together with everyone else's. And the moment when it became the sound of our pride... I loved it more than anything! I want to keep on performing more! I want more of that passion! Those cheers and those burning lights! They were all just for us! I feel like... Like, I caught a glimpse of the pinnacle! After seeing that, of course I'd want more! Right, Yukina? Doesn't that go for all of you too? Yes. Me too. We've faced so many obstacles, contemplated so many things, and this is the result! I can't wait for our next concert already! I want to perform right now! I want to keep running down this path! It's been a long journey. It's going to be an even longer journey from here. That's true. We've only planted the first step on our path as musicians, but we're on it together. I'm counting on you all. -Yeah! -Yes! Ako! Oh! Sis! I'm gonna go talk to Sis! Rin-rin, come with me? Okay. Sis! Sis! She's calling for you. Yes. Excuse me. I haven't seen you look like that in a long time. Like, you're relieved from the bottom of your heart. Really? I'm really glad I could be on stage with you today. I'm so glad I kept following you for so long. That's enough, Lisa. You say it like that ends today. Oh, you're right. Sorry. Yukina. Lisa-chan. Dad? Oh, it's been a really long time. Oh. I'll be over there. Stay here with me. Okay. Your performance today was truly amazing. I could tell you had no doubts at all. I felt a very clear strength in your voice. Thank you. I'm honored that the musician I most respect would say that about me. Dad. What is it? I love singing. And more than anyone in the world. Yukina... That's why... The song that I inherited from you, "LOUDER"... Roselia will not perform it again after today. Up until now, it has guided me along my path, but from now on, we will forge our own path on our own feet. Thank you for guiding me up until now. Lisa-chan. Y-Yes? Thank you for pursuing music together with Yukina. Thank you very much! Sorry to take up so much of your time. I look forward to seeing where you all go from here. -Thank you! -Yes. Lisa, I love music and singing from the bottom of my heart. Yeah! Lisa-nee! Yukina-san. We're all waiting for you. Let's go, Yukina! Yes. A path of blue roses into the future awaits us. Let's take our first step. I closed my eyes, and scenes of glory flashed through them Each path we forged to reach our dream Breathing in together, in that moment, it shines The miracle of bright and beautiful voices filling the air Discovering love (giving love) Supporting one another (casting aside weakness) Some days, we wavered as the showers came and went But now, we look on those memories with a smile Unfolding, the future Hemmed, from a cloudy color, now, into a bright one Connected, into the future So that we can sing our sound across the seam We'll take one step at a time from the place we found Yes, it's right here The courage to take a step forward, the cheers that I heard Echoed and shook deeply, roaring into the source of my confidence As the time passed (for each of us) We came together (like a puzzle) Our eyes always on the wall which blocked our path Higher, with a higher will, now Let's take flight Intersecting, the future Each time we stop in fear, we bid farewell to the us who would deceive us Flying, into the future To bring you the scene you wish to see and a bright blue sky We will fly above it, and beyond it We sought it with complete focus (bonds, proof) Always with the same beat Let's find a new dream And run, seeking to surpass all limits Unfolding (one your hand) the future (one my hand) And each time (our hands) our joy greater than the last Into a future connected with you (open hands) So that we can sing our sound across the seam Where I can be myself The place where we shine Yes, it's right here My feelings from that day led us to the present Maybe it was luck, or maybe destiny But strong desires came together And will begin again
