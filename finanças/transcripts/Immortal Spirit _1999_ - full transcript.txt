Excuse me, give me another drink. Sir, we're closing. Sir? Sir, we're closing now. It is four in the morning again. Are you alone... driving on the highway after a night of drinking? Is it all dark and quiet where you are? If you are feeling tired and sleepy... you might want to give your head a hard shake... give it a hard knock... or give your hair a hard tug. Whatever you do, do not fall asleep. If you fall asleep, you might... Did I scare you? Now for the latest traffic update... Crazy! Oh, come on, start. The number you dialled cannot be reached at the moment. Please try again... The number you dialled... What the heck? Hello? Come in. Since you're already here, why don't you come in? Namo Amitabha - Can you take me to find my son? - Leave me alone. Get someone else to help you... I beg you, please let me off. - My son is missing. - No... I must find him. I want revenge... My son, where are you? Where are you? My son, where are you? Namo Amitabha Hey, what's wrong? Chiu! What's wrong with you? You reek of alcohol! Have you been drinking again? Yes. What's wrong with you? Go and shower, you stink! Go! Chiu! What's wrong with you? You've been sitting there like a dummy all morning. You know how rushed I am in the mornings... but you don't even help. You just sit there waiting to be served. Tuck in. Are you all right? What time do you knock off tonight? Mom want us over for dinner tonight. Are you listening to me? You said we're having dinner tonight. Dinner, that's right. But it's over at my mom's. Are you okay? I'm fine. You don't usually take so much spice. What's wrong with you? - Are you feeling unwell? - I'm fine. Let me call in sick for you. No, I have to be at CAPO today. (Complaints Against Police Office) Again? It's better to be hypocritical than to be brutally honest. Especially when you're a police officer. You're a decent man but you tend to offend people. What is it this time? It's nothing much. Nothing much? You never tell me anything. Do you take me as your girlfriend? I don't even know where you are stationed. Mom is always asking me about you but I don't know how to answer her. She's such a busybody. What did you say? She is being nosy. I'm courting you, not her. Why does she want to know so much? She's worried that I picked the wrong man. She wants to know more about you. What's wrong with that? So do you think I'm the wrong man for you? You have no idea how much I'm regretting it. Do you mean it? I've told you to lay off the drinking but you just won't listen. You get nightmares every time you're drunk. There was even once when you got possessed. Where did you hear such nonsense from? Nonsense? I heard it from your sister. Ask her if you don't believe me. I have to leave for work. I'll really leave you if you go drinking again. You hear me? This is the last time I'm telling you this. Come straight home after you've been to CAPO. We'll go to my mom's place together. Don't forget! Li Chiu Yan, please come in. Complaints Department Room B Morning, sir. - Are you PC2469, Li Chiu Yan? - Yes, sir. - Sit. - Thank you, sir. PC2469, I've gone through your records. Over the past six months... you have had three complaints lodged against you. They are as follows. On the first of October, 1998 at 8:40pm... you stopped a Chinese male along Dundas Street in Mong Kok, Kowloon. Said Chinese male complained that you lost your temper... and threw his identity card into the gutter intentionally. Second complaint. On March nineteenth, 1999, at 11:00pm... you assaulted a Chinese male by the name of Wu Yau Yau along Kimberly Road. According to him, you were drunk at the time of assault. The third case took place on March twenty-ninth, 1999, at 7:00pm. You used unnecessary force while performing your duty... along Portland Street in Mong Kok... and injured a Chinese male by the name of Chen Ping. What are you doing here, Mike? I'm in charge of this case. Where else would I be? PC2469, as a police officer... you must obey the law and know your responsibilities. When did you become a cop? PC2469, what are you doing? Sit down. Sit down. I said sit down! PC2469, I would suggest you see a counsellor at the earliest opportunity. This inquiry is adjourned until further notice. You may go. Thank you, sir. Let me help you. Are you any good at it? - Of course I am. - Be careful. Don't cut me. I'm bleeding. - Are you okay? - This is bad. Aren't you worried about letting me know so many of your secrets? Because I wish you'd be more like me. I wish you'd tell me everything. And not keep anything from me. But don't worry, I won't force you. What are you writing? A letter to the cops saying you're holding a heist tomorrow. Which means you'll be responsible should anything happen. Just joking. Come on, let's go for a drink. You've reached the voicemail. No one is in right now. Please leave your message after the beep. I'll get back to you soon. Cut it out. This is no time for jokes. What's wrong? Have you been jilted or fired? Confess now. Dad has found out about the complaints against Chiu. So what? It's just a few complaints. At worst he won't get promoted. Exactly! Dad said Chiu has no future. He wants you to move back home right away. Sure, how much is the rent? Quote me a price. Sis, Dad means it this time. That's how he has always been. He looks down on Chiu and has always objected to my seeing him. Frankly speaking, I don't know what you see in Chiu. He does nothing but drink. What do you want then? What's important is he is kind. A kind man with no future. How do I answer to Dad? How to answer to him? Just tell him you couldn't reach me. - What's wrong, Sis? - What are you doing, Chiu? - What's wrong? - I've got to go. What are you doing? Did the inquiry go badly? Let's get you out of here. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing? You wouldn't have got yourself drenched then. What's wrong? Are you in serious trouble because of those complaints? Don't worry so much. The worst that can happen is you don't get promotions. You won't be dismissed. Even if you can't be a police officer, you can always be a security guard. Just like those young girls nowadays. If they can't be Miss Asia, they'll try their luck at being Miss Hong Kong. You see this happening every year. There are opportunities everywhere. It all depends on how you make use of it. Stop brooding over it. Take a nap now. I'll wake you up for dinner, all right? Who is it? Who could that be? Miss, a lunatic has sneaked into this building. Please be careful. Don't open the door to strangers. A lunatic has sneaked in here? What the heck? Honey? Son? Honey? Son? Where are you all? Happy birthday! Why do you look so scared? It's you. Come in. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Congratulations! Congratulations! - Yeah... - Yeah... You nearly scared me to death. You mustn't say such inauspicious things on your birthday. Make your wish. Okay. - Yay! - Yay! Do I get a birthday kiss? Yes, you do. Hurry. Are you two done? I want to have cake. All right. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. All right, let's tuck in. And this is yours. Are you looking for me? Why did you lie to me? I lied to you? But I don't even know you. I've only met you that once at the inquiry. Are you sure you got the right person? Liar! Do you know Lily Wong? Tell me honestly... who was that woman last night? Is she your wife? Is that kid your son? I don't owe you any answers. You lied to me! You said you loved me! You're out of your mind. Go and see a psychiatrist. Don't go! You must make it clear today. What the heck are you doing! There's nothing for us to talk about. If there's anything you want to say, say it to your superior. Do you understand? I won't let you off. I won't let you off! You've been looking for him for seven years? Yes. You suspect that he was an undercover agent? I'm very sure he was one. Really? What makes you so certain? Back when we were together... he was nothing more than a small-time thug. I hadn't seen him again until I possessed you and went to CAPO. I'm sure he's the man I've been looking for. I've spent years wandering alone in the mortal plane... just to find him. I've finally found him now. He used to be a small-time thug. But in just a few years, he has become a high-ranking officer. He is even married with a kid now. What other explanation is there? Tell me. He's a police officer and you're a crook. You broke the law and he busted you for it. What's wrong with that? I don't care. He cheated my feelings. And he betrayed me. That puts him in the wrong. What do you want then? I want revenge. What do you think? You want revenge? Leave me out of it. The grievance between you two has nothing to do with me. Stop hounding me. The most I can do is burn some offerings for you. Save it, that won't work. I'm the one calling the shots here... not you. If you are that powerful, seek revenge by yourself. Don't pester me. You're human. You don't understand. I went through so much to find him. I will not let him off so easily for what he has done to me. I want him to know how it feels to be cheated and murdered. If I want to seek revenge... I will need a human form. Do you realise what you are planning will do me harm? I'm sorry, but I will reward you after I've succeeded. You're too selfish. Leave. There's nothing more for us to say. Stop pestering me. What are you doing? What are you doing? Getting a drink of water. Open the door...! Open the door... Is anyone in? Open the door! What are you doing? Who are you looking for? Open the door! Open the door! Open the door now! Open the door now! Who are you looking for? Why are you living with Mike? Who are you? - What are you talking about? - Do you know he was with me first? Why must you snatch him from me? I think you've got the wrong address. Come back! You haven't answered me! Come back! - Open the door... - What do you want? Open the door! Open the door! - Open the door! - Get lost! Open the door! Let me in! Answer me! Who are you? Tell me! I watched you join the police force and rise through the ranks. Do you know what you're doing? You can be charged with harassment. Or coercion! Give me an explanation. You have nothing to say? So you'll give it up? I'm not giving it up. I won't let him off. I want him to suffer! Do you know what you're saying? Do you know you can be charged with making threats for saying this? What on earth are you doing? I mean it. What did you say? I did not pursue the matter of you harassing Mike in the toilet at CAPO. And now you're causing more trouble. Do you still want your job? Just look at you. All disheveled and unkempt. What's wrong with you? Why are you so out of sorts? He's an officer of CAPO. What's more, he's in charge of your case. He has the right to investigate you. If you're unhappy with him, you can lodge a complaint against him. Why must you cause so much trouble? This won't do you any good. I'm tired of going over to CAPO every day to answer for your actions. You've been working under me for years. I want what is good for you too. If you're not well, I'll grant you medical leave. But I want an explanation for your actions. I do not want our unit to be implicated by your doings. I'm not sick, I don't need to go on medical leave. Fine, just so you can't cause more trouble... hand over your gun and badge. You're suspended. Let me warn you... I'll arrest you personally if you harass him again. Out! Have you been naughty in school today? No. - Really? Really? - No... No ice-cream for you. If you're hungry, have some bread after we get home. I'll make you some sushi later. All right, have some bread for now. Mom, I want to watch TV. No! Isn't this fun? Don't be afraid, I won't kill you. I'll keep you alive to torment you. This is all Mike's fault. If there's anyone you should blame, it's him. Mrs Cheung, did you manage to see the perpetrator's face? He splashed a whole bucket of cold water in my face... I couldn't get a good look at him. Do you owe anyone money or have you made any enemies lately? We haven't made any enemies. But someone did came by a few days ago and harassed me. It was a man. How did he harass you? I didn't know what he was going on about. He kept banging on the gates and demanded to see me. I don't know him so I didn't let him in. And after that? He kept shouting threats at me, so I called the police. I heard that he's actually a police officer. Have you received any threats or blackmail calls prior to this? No, not at all. Police. Honey, are you all right? What happened? What's going on? Tell me. Cheung Sir, I'm CID Officer Lai Ming. What happened was... someone left the gas in your kitchen on in an attempt... to blow up your wife and son. Luckily, there was a power cut in this area today... otherwise your wife and son would have been killed. Everything's all right now, so don't worry. Why would this happen? You have the cheek to ask me? Weren't you at home this morning? How could someone sneak in? It's only natural that I'm asking you. Cheung Sir, are you free? I need to take your statement. - I'll find you at the station later. - Sure. - Are you guys done? - Yes. Let's clear out then. Thank you, Mrs Cheung. We'll contact you again if there's a need. - Okay, thanks. - You're welcome. - Thanks, see you later. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Honey, how did this happen? You have the cheek to ask? Ask yourself what you have done! Why would that man harass us again and again? What could I have done? We've been married for years. Don't you trust me? He wouldn't be harassing us if you hadn't done something to him. He told me outright that this is all your fault... and there's no one to blame but you. Honey, I swear I don't know anything about this. You know nothing? You better think harder! Honey... - Don't touch me! - Honey... Honey! Hey! Hey! Don't go! Don't go! Come back! Honey. - Son? - Daddy. Why aren't you in bed? - I can't sleep. - Come here. Why can't you sleep? I'm scared. Don't be scared. There's nothing to be scared of. I'll be guarding the door. Go back to bed, all right? Kiss me goodnight. Be good. Watch your step. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Daddy, Mommy and I will be staying at Grandma's place. Joe Coming. - Mom. - Mike, you're here. - Is May here? - Yes, she is. Why didn't you come earlier? I could only come after I knocked off. What's going on between you two? I don't know. She's mad at me for no reason. Go over and coax her. Honey, are you still mad? Don't be mad. Or I'll tickle you. - Here I come. - Cut it out! - Have some tea, Mike. - Thanks, Mom. There's no quarrel between a couple that can't be resolved. Just talk things over peacefully. Stay out of this, Mom. Shouldn't you at least give Mike a chance to explain? For all you know, it could be just a misunderstanding. Fine, explain yourself. Who is that man? I have no idea. I met him once at CAPO. He told me he loves me and started stalking me. I have no idea what's going on either. He must be crazy. Do you realise our son and I nearly died? That's it? How do you expect me to believe you? - Would you have believed it? - Yes, because it's the truth. The truth? Tell me the truth about this ring then. Hey, do you have any idea... how long I've been looking for this? So it's been with you all along. You just don't trust me. I've lost all my trust in you. I can understand if you have another woman behind my back. But an affair with a man? How do I accept that? An affair with a man? Ask yourself. You better think it over. Sort out your sexual orientation before you find me. Do you like it? Sorry. Whatever for? You're too much. How could you fool around with a man? Do you believe that? No, I don't. Find a chance and explain things to her. Okay, I will. I'll be off, Mom. Wait. Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm off then. - What do you want? - Do you still care what I do? Did that feel good? He's attacking me! - Stop it... - He's attacking me. Li Chiu Yan, you scumbag! Stop harassing me and my family! What the heck do you want? Fight me like a man if you dare! Mike, I'm telling you this as a friend. You must understand... you're a high-ranking police officer. How could you beat up a lowly street cop in public? Think of the consequences. But he is harassing my family. Report him to the police and let the police deal with it. You shouldn't have taken matters into your own hands. What are you going to do if this hits the news? And don't forget, you're being reviewed for a promotion. If news of your fight leaks out, it'll affect your chances of a promotion. You worked very hard to get to where you are today. Surely you wouldn't want this to end your career. But he keeps harassing May and my son. Do I take it lying down? Mike, why are you so rash? What have you done to him? Why is he pestering you? He's a raving lunatic. I don't know what he wants. Since you know he's a lunatic, why bother with him? I won't let him off if he messes with my family again. Let me deal with him. I'll talk to his superior about it. There's this Chinese saying, "Fine china is more fragile than earthenware." Remember, you're fine china while he's earthenware. But you grew up abroad, you won't understand this. You're right. - I'll be off. - See you. Show yourself! What exactly do you want? I know you're here. Don't think you can hide from me! Haven't you got me into enough trouble? I'm already in enough trouble as it is. What more do you want? Look at the state I'm in now! What more do you want? I'm sorry. You're sorry? What's the use of saying sorry? Show yourself, will you? Don't you have the guts to show yourself? I told you, I'll reward you after I've taken revenge. Reward me? I don't want your reward! Haven't you done me enough harm? Show yourself and talk to me! Stop possessing me! Fine, I'll show myself. Leave me alone, I beg of you! - What exactly do you want? - I'll reward you now. No... Don't come any closer... No... don't come any closer! No! Don't... don't come any closer! No...! What do you want? No! No...! Why are you taking my trousers off? What do you want? No... Chiu! What's wrong? What are you doing down there? - Don't scare me. - Don't come near me! Ouch, my foot. - Chiu, did you get into a fight? - Don't come near me! What's going on? What happened to you? What's wrong? Come on, hold this amulet. - Take it... - No... - No... - Take it... Your mom thinks you're possessed. - She got this amulet for you. - No...! Are you all right, Chiu? Are you okay? How is it? Are you okay, Chiu? Are you all right, Chiu? Chiu! What's wrong? Ghost... Chiu! Ghost... - Ghost... - What? What are you talking about? Stay away from me... - Stop following me! - Where are you going, Chiu! Chiu! I don't see any ghosts. Stop following me... Stop following me. Stop following me. Don't bother running away. There's nowhere you can hide from a ghost. Please let me use your body. No, don't come any closer. No, don't come any closer... Don't come any closer! No...! I've caught you...! Let go of me! You're crazy! - Ghost...! - You can't run from me. No. I have an amulet. Scared? So you're scared. Show yourself! Show yourself! Come on! Come on! I'm not scared of you! Come on! Show yourself! Hey, what are you up to? Nothing! I'm catching a ghost. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. - Are you out of your mind? - Go away...! I have to catch her! Go away...! My amulet...! I need my amulet! Get away from me! My amulet! Panorama Gardens, please. View Mansion... It's you! Let me out of the taxi! Let me out of the taxi! - Cheung Sir? - Speaking. Listen carefully. You wife is in my hands. If you want to rescue her, come to Yuen Leng Village at once. Hubby! Hubby! What do you want? Save me, Cheung Sir... There's a ghost after me! Where's my wife? Where's my wife? Stop messing with me! Help... There's really a ghost after me! - Where's my wife? - Help... Hubby! Help! Hubby! Help, Cheung Sir. Help... there's a ghost after me. Where are you, honey? Honey! Honey... Honey... Honey, are you okay? Honey? Hubby! Hubby! Hurry! Come over here! Hubby! - What's going on? - Hubby! Come here... - Honey! - Come here! Lily, it's you! Why? Why did you kill me? You promised to love me for life. You said we'd leave this place together. So you're the one behind everything! No. No! It's your fault for deceiving me! Fine. Kill me if that's what you want. But leave my wife and son out of this. It's been seven years, but you're still nursing a grudge. What do you want from me? Finally scared? It's been seven years. I've spent seven years roaming the mortal plane for you. I love you so much. How could I bear to kill you? Who are you? Stop! I'm her mother, that foreigner is my son-in-law. Mom, why are you here? I thought something was wrong with Mike when I saw him two days ago... and I've been trailing him. So you're the one making trouble! Tell me who you are! You're no ordinary old lady. You're no ordinary stray ghost either. You've been dead for years, why do you still remain in the mortal world? - Why don't you... - Shut up! If not for him, I would have gone for reincarnation. I must take him away with me today! You won't be able to be reincarnated even if you kill him. Whatever grudges you may be nursing, talk it out once and for all! Shut up. He lied to me, used me and shot me to death. Why shouldn't I seek revenge? Your brother wanted to kill me... I fired in self-defence. I didn't know you would... Self-defence? You were actually a cop! You lied to me right from the start. He did me wrong first. Yes, he did lie to you. But he's a policeman and you're a crook. It is his duty to arrest crooks. You can't fault him for that. Fine, he's a cop and I'm a crook. It is his duty. But did he have to sleep with me? Did he have to lie and say he loves me? Did he have to promise to love me for forever? Answer me! Yes, I admit I was wrong. I did that to crack the case. But if you weren't a crook, I really would've married you. If Mike is such a heartless man... I wouldn't have let my daughter marry him. Miss, why don't you just let this go? There's no point in dwelling on it. Fine. I'll give him a chance. If he can prove what he just said is true... I promise I'll let him off. You're already dead. How do you expect me to prove my words? You needn't worry, I have my ways. If you've been lying to me, I'll take you away with me. Mom, what should we do? Please help Mike. I'll help if I can. But it will all depend on him now. Mike, if you really didn't do her any wrong... you must end this matter yourself. How is he supposed to do that? Help Mike, please. Step aside. All the gods in Heaven... all the demons in Hell... all fairies and goddesses... please take Mike and Lily back in time through the passage of heaven and hell... to ascertain what had happened. - Brother, are you okay? - Boss, are you okay? Hang in there! The cops won't find us here for now. I'll go out to find something to dress your wound. And check if the cops have found their way here. I'll be right back! Boss... You... Traitor. Brother, why did you kill him? - Dee has been your follower for... - Shut up! How many times have I told you? Don't trust anyone so easily. No one knew about the heist but us and him. Who could the traitor be, if not him? Unless it was you! Brother! Who is it? Come out! Come out! Brother! Who are you? He's Mike, the man I've been telling you about. What is he doing here? I told him to come. He'll be coming along with us. Come here... Come here! Brother! Don't move! Go to the village store and get me something to dress my wound. Hurry, Mike. Hold it. Brother. Look out for cops too. Keep your eyes open! I'll go with him. Mike! Brother! No! Don't shoot! Sister! Sister, he... Mike, why... why do you have a gun? Lily! Hang in there, Lily. - The ambulance will be here soon. - Why? Why do you... Stay awake. I'll be right back! Hang in there! No one is supposed to know about the heist besides us. How did the cops get wind of it? Did you betray me? Who is it? Come out... Brother! Who are you? He's Mike, the man I've been telling you about. What is he doing here? I told him to come. He'll be coming along with us. Come here... Brother! Don't move! Go to the village store and get me something to dress my wound. Hurry, Mike. Hold it. Brother. Look out for cops too. Keep your eyes open. I'll go with him. Mike! Brother! No! Don't shoot! Sister! Sister, he... Mike, why... why do you have a gun? Why am I back here again? Why? What's going on? Offer an incense to your dad, son. Mom, how did Dad die? I told you before. You dad was a police officer. He killed a crook in an operation before you were born. Seven years later, that crook found out that Dad had betrayed her. So when I was six years old... the spirit of that crook came back to seek revenge against Dad. And eventually took Dad away with her. Mom, I'm an adult now. Why don't you just tell me the truth? That is the truth. There's nothing I can do if you don't believe me. - Mom, let me carry it for you. - It's all right. Mom? Mom, are you okay? I'm fine. Let's go. Oh yes, why hasn't Michelle been coming over for dinner lately? How are you getting on with her? We're getting along well. That's what you always say. Listen to me... don't string her along if you aren't serious about her. You mustn't toy with people's feelings. I know, Mom. Translator: MEDI-LAN/SPECTRA MEDIA
