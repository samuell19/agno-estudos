No, more like glass... Wipe it. - Oh shit! - An accident! Someone call the police! Somebody help! Look, a woman I think. Are you okay? Dive in. Someone help. Hold on here! Hang on! Hold firm. There. A little bit further, there! There! What happened? You dozed off? You okay? Hey, come on. An ambulance is coming. Hold on. Hey, what is it? My husband... my husband's inside. He's still in the car? ROAD SAFETY Yeah, a car plunged in. Quay A at Shinko Harbour. A fatality, yes. And Criminal Affairs... The unit chief's here too. Yeah, it's been designated a criminal matter. I don't know. Anyway, I'm going over there. Hey, have you discovered anything? It's useless. It's pitch black down there! Try checking just by the position. Right. There are neither skid marks nor signs of the brakes being applied. The people helping us? They've gone to change clothes. I see. I'll leave it to you. You've identified them? Yeah, I'm off to the hospital. Koba-chan! Koba-chan! Who the hell is it? Come on, tell me. The woman is Kumako Shirakawa. It seems her husband's inside. - Shirakawa? - Yeah. Of Shirakawa Breweries? Fukutaro. So the one rescued was that wife of his. Hey, hold it properly... Give it to me. How long are you going to be here? I'm exhausted. I swallowed water and my head hurts. Just get out of my face. Mrs. Shirakawa. It doesn't give us any pleasure either. We have to give details to... Look, I've been telling you! My husband was at the wheel... and drove into the sea through his own mistake. So... how did this incident come about? How the hell should I know! Hey, enough of that. Your husband's still in the water. We're sorry Mrs. Shirakawa, it's unpleasant but it's our job. We're going to stay and keep you company. Nurse! Listen, nurse. How is she? Did she say anything? She's weird. Weird? It's strange. Even though her husband's died. What? Can you determine whether it was the man or woman driving? Well now, in this condition... Isn't the leg room a bit tight on the driver's side? The lever's come loose. It's not necessarily due to the driver's physique. Surely it wouldn't break so cleanly. I guess this shoe came off in the impact. Here, look. I take it you're a good swimmer. I lived in Amakusa when I was a kid. What of it? You knew that Fukutaro couldn't swim. Yes, I knew. Why did you go to the quay especially? Passing by your own home. My husband suggested seeing the night view. Even though you were tired and it was raining as well. Sightseeing at night? Because he said he wanted to see the night view. What about the insurance? How much is it? In total it amounts to 310 million yen! And you're the recipient! You have four previous convictions. Blackmail, fraud, assault, intent to injure. It seems you were a hostess in Tokyo. How did you meet Fukutaro? What is this? So what if I've previous convictions? What have I done? Give it a rest. Cut the crap, you bitch! There's no need for insults. What are you saying? You think that I killed him? What rude people you are. I bet you didn't sleep a wink last night. No way can I sleep. A murder for the insurance money... would be an extraordinary crime. Mother-in-law. I thought something like this may happen. Katsuyuki. Did that woman kill him? If only your sister were still alive, Fukutaro wouldn't have picked up that woman in Tokyo. Listen... Katsuyuki, please take care of Muneharu. That child is the last of the Shirakawa family now. Yes. What for? Whatever is Kumako here for? Detective. That woman has come? Please send her away. I think you'll understand I can't allow her to set foot in here. Actually, Mrs. Shirakawa, I'd like to show her Fukutaro's corpse. To observe her reaction. Hey, get out the way. Let her out. A word please. Do it later! Kumako! You were saved and you're very much alive. Please just go and look at him! Fukutaro... Fukutaro... Kumako! Take a good look at his face and pay your last respects. Please take a look! SUSPICIONS OVER KUMAKO INTENSIFY Yesterday, Professor Anzai of Hokuriku University called me, so I can report his forensic opinion. Er, a detailed report will be submitted later on regarding damage to the car... and the findings about the dead body. But in the professor's view... there's little doubt Kumako drove, Fukutaro sat in the passenger seat. Er, clear signs of subcutaneous bleeding... covered both of Fukutaro's knees. And the baggage rack in front of the passenger seat has dents. That means there's a strong possibility... the wounds were caused when his knees smashed into the baggage rack. What about the spanner? Was it used to break the windscreen? It seems that can't be proven yet. What a joke! Then why exactly was it lying in the car? The toolbox was inside the trunk! Anyway, we can assume Kumako was driving. I think that's fine. - Why not seek an arrest warrant? - But... all we have is the strong possibility that Fukutaro was in the passenger seat. That being said, since the case was reported, we've been inundated with angry phone calls. But, even under arrest, we can't expect her to confess. With more proof... Chief, we've almost finished the blackmail charge... and the other gathering of evidence from Kumako's past. Enough material has been collected to retain her in custody. - So, an unrelated matter? - Yes. No, let's avoid that. Go for an arrest warrant on a murder charge. Commissioner, Kumako's at the traffic division! - What? - What for? She wants an accident certificate for her insurance claim. Taking the piss! She must be taunting us! Don't fuck with the police! Why can't you issue it? Do you know what a road accident certificate is? You're supposed to issue it regardless of culpability or cause. Look, the investigation needs more time. But it's already known that the car fell into the sea. Hey, guv'nor! Sort it out. Just reel her in. Such a dark charge. If only it were that simple. He's tetchy as well. Too true. At least keep giving it the big splash. Please. Christ, I want that bitch dead. Same again please. And the prospects? How long will you leave it? Don't worry, we're making steady progress. This morning Yamazaki went to Tokyo... Hey, Sasaki! Tokyo? What for? Sasaki, that hasn't been... What's the problem? A pimp, you see, a pimp. He's Kumako's ex, Toyosaki. Jeez, I give up. You've had a few too many. Hey... hey, what is it? Sorry, I have to go... Hey! Akitani! Hello. Yeah, wait a second. Mr. Akitani, Tokyo office. Okay. Yes, it's me. Well? Yeah. Katsuo Toyosaki. Unemployed, no fixed address. Imprisoned for fraud three years ago. Currently on parole. Involved in all of Kumako's previous crimes. Which train from Ueno? This is Toyama. Of course, it's possible that she killed him. But it's nothing to do with me. I'm on parole, so I'm not too clued up. I can talk about the old days. But I haven't seen her for 3 years now. Besides, we were only involved in petty crimes. This time it's murder? Difficult to say really. Ah, did Toyosaki say anything? A few things. But nothing newsworthy. Where is he? Already left. Where's he gone? I couldn't say. Hello. It's on my company, so let him drink sensibly. A cheap room's fine. Yes, certainly. Also... Let me know if he goes off somewhere. Yes, sir. Sorry to keep you. Why not have a drink while your room's prepared? Ah, thanks for going to so much trouble. There's no need to worry. Let your hair down. Better than those papers bothering you, isn't it? I don't talk to them. I know what you're saying. If you should recall something... Let's drink to it. Well...I'm really trying to remember... And... here's something. For now... Tell me if you need more. I wonder if I'll remember? Cheers. In these last few days I've been in a daze... Wondering how something like this happened. Anyway, I can no longer sleep. When the car plunged into the sea, I was able to drag myself up because the windscreen broke. Otherwise, I'd have surely died. And yet I have to be talked to like this, even though I'm an injured party. It's unbearable. But isn't a total insurance payout of 300 million yen a bit excessive? Why? My husband's fortune is 1 billion. Shirakawa Breweries' annual turnover exceeds 500 million. What was the motive for taking out the insurance? Look, although he couldn't swim, my husband went fishing a lot. I didn't ask him to take out insurance especially. He suggested it himself. So your husband predicted he would meet with an accident? Wasn't he taking a precaution? Isn't that it? Ordinarily. Which paper are you? The Hokuriku Daily Report. Who wrote that I broke the windscreen with a spanner... and that I was driving the car, amongst other rubbish. Our stories always have a foundation. Would you mind speaking from a bit further back? I'd appreciate it. Get back. How interesting. I didn't kill him, so clearly I'm not guilty. It's ridiculous. Writing sensationalist stories for the hell of it, they call people like you hacks. Try saying that again. Don't deride the press! Who'd do something so stupid as driving a car into the sea... with the aim of getting the insurance money? For a start, you could end up dead and lose everything. Give it a try yourselves if you think I'm lying. What's his name? Er... that stupid police inspector... in Toyama? Yamazaki! I suppose it was his idea? It's really unfortunate. We support these people with our taxes. Didn't he fabricate this case to earn brownie points? It's because I'm a woman. I'm sure they don't have any evidence, so how can the police arrest me? They should just try it. Damn it! The bitch is mocking me. Hey, I saw that car. Eh, really? Yep! That woman was driving. You know... That night you stood me up... I called you from the harbour. Ah! Then. You should tell someone. That's right. Yeah, but... I don't want to get involved in police matters. KUMAKO ARRESTED! THANKS TO EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY DETERMINED TO BE A DISGUISED MURDER HEARTLESS, PREMEDITATED CRIME It seems you've had a request from Kumako to be her defence counsel. Yes. As I'm the Shirakawas' legal adviser. She has nobody else to turn to. I got a phone call shortly after the incident. She wants my help if it goes to trial. After the incident? So Kumako was expecting to be arrested? Because of the stuff you guys were writing. The Shirakawa family haven't said anything? About what? Well... one might say you're working for the enemy. Don't talk nonsense. They're separate matters. I think they fully understand that. For co-counsel, I heard you made a request to Kanetaka Okamura in Tokyo. Who told you? Apparently you went to Tokyo to ask him personally. Mr. Okamura was my understudy at college. Presently, he's one of the foremost criminal lawyers in Japan. It would be most encouraging should someone so able agree to be co-counsel. It's not confirmed? No, I haven't yet got a binding agreement. He said he'd come and interview her at the detention centre first. I should get an answer then. You're ill? Hmm? It's my liver. For 10 years now. - Thanks for coming. - Ah, hello. So it leaked out then. My apologies. Seems the passenger list was checked. Yeah, that... TOYAMA PENITENTIARY That was a surprisingly long interview. You spoke in detail? No questions came from me, I merely listened. But it took two hours. Well, the accused argued her innocence continuously. Pleading innocence? I wouldn't say it quite like that. It was more like a speech. How circumstantial evidence alone isn't enough for a guilty verdict. She's studying the law in her cell. Well, it's a sound argument. It's as though she fancies herself a trainee lawyer. What is she saying specifically? I can't say, I can't say. She spoke with the assumption I'll be her defence counsel. We've a duty to protect a defendant's secrets. But I guess you said a few words too? Just at the end. What did you say? That you can be convicted by circumstantial evidence alone. How did she respond? Did she flare up at you? Well, it seemed my words were a considerable shock. She suddenly sank into silence and stared at me. Sensei. What you said to the accused is an extremely delicate matter. But can we take it you won't be able to take on the role of defence counsel, due to the weight of circumstantial evidence? Hey, come on. Listen, I take on defendants because the odds are stacked against them. It's my true calling as a lawyer. Well, generally... Once I've returned to Tokyo and given it some thought, I'll give Mr. Harayama my answer on whether I'll defend Kumako Shirakawa. I'm hopeful, though. Mr. Okamura's participation would be a great advantage in the trial. We'd win. It's just circumstantial evidence. Material evidence is quite absent. And there's no confession. I believe Mr. Okamura's prowess will surely demolish the prosecution case. News-desk! It's rumoured Tokyo lawyer Okamura declined the co-counsel role. - Really? - Yep, it's swept the bar association. The reason? Officially, no comment. But it seems the family are opposed. Even if he took on the case and won, he'd end up losing favour. It seems his estimation as a lawyer would plummet. So much for his fine talk. After all, he's no fool. 16TH SEPTEMBER 1981 PUBLIC HEARING BEGINS Stand! We will now commence the trial of Kumako Shirakawa... in a homicide case under public prosecution. Defendant, approach. Your honor. Yes? I know it's sudden. But I'd like to resign from the role of defence counsel in the current case. Why is this? If this trial brings in a guilty verdict, the defendant appeals. If not guilty, the prosecution appeals. Furthermore, a final appeal would go to the supreme court. As for myself, I've long had a bad liver. I've neither the confidence nor the stamina to see this through alone. Please allow me to beg your pardon. Hang on. Wait, you're my lawyer! Stop, calm down! Wait! Calm down! The first report! News-desk, lawyer Harayama resigned in the courtroom. Why? I know it's hard to assign a lawyer, but it's down to the criminal procedure law. Based on that, the court won't convene unless there's a defence lawyer. A state appointment nominated by the court wouldn't be objectionable. However, the selection criteria's vague. KUMAKO'S COURT-APPOINTED LAWYER Ritsuko Sahara? - A woman? - Yes. It seems she specialises in civil law. She appears quite capable in that respect. But why someone like that? No one'll take it on. She's single. Though saying that, she's divorced and has a kid with her ex-husband. Apparently, he has custody. Normally it goes to the woman. You'll make inquiries? No, it's too early. Someone like Kumako might not take kindly to a female lawyer. I'm lawyer Sahara. I feel for you. You've drawn the short straw. Lawyers have been running this way and that eh? How laughable. Four previous offences. Hokuriku's most evil woman, insuring her husband then killing him. Kumako Onizuka... The name Kumako Onizuka is unfortunate too. This is it. Hmm... with a name like Sayoko Tachibana, for instance... or Shizuko Saotome... it'd be very different. I suppose you think I killed him? You know, I loathe your face. The police, the press... you people are all the same... I... I'll go it alone, I don't need a lawyer. I'll manage. To hell with a perfunctory lawyer. You want to get the death penalty? You can refuse if you dislike me? I can also refuse to represent you. But... A trial for an offence... punishable by death, life imprisonment or a term exceeding three years... is impossible without a defence lawyer. It's clearly stated in Article 289 of the criminal procedure code. I believe you're studying the statute books? Read it. WRITTEN STATEMENT. I'll tell you what I know about Kumako Shirakawa. Kumako was born on 3rd February 1954, the fifth daughter of Yohei Hamaguchi, a fisherman from Amakusa. At the age of five... she was adopted by Kotaro Onizuka, who ran an ironworks in Yatsushiro City. I met Kumako after she'd dropped out of her local high school... and was working as a hostess at a snack bar in Nakasu, Fukuoka. At the time, I was a tending at a nearby bar. After it closed we dated repeatedly... and soon things became intimate. We entered into cohabitation at apartment 1-5 in Nishijin, Fukuoka. But while I was doing a stint in jail due to a bit of fighting, Kumako married young master Yoichi Moriguchi, of the family-owned, traditional restaurant "Yoryu". And from Moriguchi's parents they received their own detached house. It seems they lived happily. Three years later in 1975, because I'd been released from prison, Kumako suggested taking the title deed of the Moriguchi establishment. We disposed of it in exchange for around 100 million yen. Naturally, she got divorced too. Taking the money, Kumako went with me to Tokyo and opened a club in the Ginza. However, business was sluggish and it finally went under in March 1977. That night, Kumako roughed up one of the hostesses, Aiko Yamaguchi. She received a three-year jail term for inflicting bodily harm, to be served at Tochigi Prison. After Kumako had been released from that prison in August 1979, she drifted through jobs in the clubs of Tokyo's Shinjuku ward. From December that year, while I was doing time for a little extortion, Kumako worked as a hostess at the club "Blue Flag", where apparently she met the victim in this matter, Fukutaro Shirakawa. Cute, isn't it? Here. You've taken on Kumako? Yes, I constantly get nuisance phone calls. Why not quit? My job is none of your business. I guess so. Here you go. But you'll be busy from now on. It's okay, I can make time. Aya-chan, where shall we go next month? Actually... Here. Sakie says she wants to meet you. She's helping me a great deal. It seems it's about Ayako. Really? It must be nice having a dutiful wife. Oh, it's stopped has it? I don't see any need to meet her. 20TH JANUARY 1982 THE TRIAL RESUMES Prosecutor, read out the charge. Er... the charged facts. The accused, plotting to kill an insured party in a fake accident... and thus swindling a vast insurance payout, in late December 1979, while looking for a suitable target, became acquainted with Fukutaro Shirakawa, proprietor of Shirakawa Breweries, immediately currying favour with the said person and making advances. On 1st June 1980, got married to Fukutaro... and from 7th April to 10th June 1981... took out insurance with six firms, including Marubishi Life Insurance, worth up to 310 million yen in the event of Fukutaro's death. On 11th July that year, on the pretext of seeing Nata temple, picked up the said person in a 1978 Crown, taking him out for a drive, and on that same day, at 7:20pm, to bring to fruition this long-held plan, and with Fukutaro still in the passenger seat, drove the car off quay A of Shinko Bay Harbour into 8 metres of seawater, sending the car and Fukutaro to the bottom of the sea thus instantly drowning the said person in an act of murder. The charge is murder. Penal statute Article 199. There will be times when you're questioned in this courtroom. But you needn't answer if you don't want to. You won't be disadvantaged by choosing to remain silent. You are also free to make statements if you wish. Those statements may be used as evidence, either for or against you. Alright? So, do you have anything to say in regard to the prosecution's indictment? The guy's right about the marriage with Fukutaro, the insurance contracts, and the drive to Nata. But all the rest is bullshit. The kind of thing that's commonly fabricated without any real evidence. It's preposterous. It wasn't me driving the car, my husband was driving it. My husband's death was caused purely by his own mistake. Defence counsel? Er, the defence denies the charges. Accordingly, I assert the defendant is innocent. Miss Sahara. - I'm Akitani of the Daily Report. - Hello. I assume you read my news article. Well. Why did you undertake to defend such a woman? Were you forced to take it on? Well, I sympathise. Sensei. Tell me your motive. Motive? Don't worry, it's off the record. Do you think you can disprove Kumako's guilt? It's yet to be decided if Kumako Shirakawa is guilty or not. The guilt you speak of... is it the verdict passed by the media? 24th Feb FIFTH HEARING. What was the basis of your conclusion that the defendant was driving the car? A wound under Fukutaro's right kneecap... and a wound interior to his left kneecap... correspond with two dents under the car's glove compartment. So I concluded Fukutaro was in the passenger seat. If that was the case, it naturally means the defendant was in the driver's seat. Your inspection of the vehicle took place 11 days after the accident. In other words, on the 22nd July. That's right. Here are some newspapers covering the 11th to the 22nd July. "Car Plunges Into Sea - Husband Drowns, Wife Escapes." "Many Anomalies, Dead Husband Was Insured For 300m Yen." Did you read these articles? Yes, I did. However... it wasn't something that prejudiced my conclusion. The spanner that allegedly was used in the escape. Naturally, you have seen this spanner? Yes. It's 15 centimetres long and about 4 millimetres thick. Do you think the windscreen could be broken by this spanner? It's not impossible. But to break the windscreen, wouldn't it be more effective to use a hammer rather than this spanner? Well, it's possible it would be more effective. But the fact is a spanner had been left in the car. Next, the point about Fukutaro's left shoe having come off. Your description is extremely vague. Er, "By chance, the impact of the plunge and the water..." Hey... hey. Come on... Hmm? What? Who's on trial here? - I am, aren't I? - Please sit down. Listen, you're leaving me out of it. I wasn't driving, I was in the passenger seat. Why suppose Fukutaro was the passenger? Look, it's because the damage to the car and Fukutaro's injuries... I have injuries too! We suddenly crashed into the sea. It was mayhem. I've many injuries too. You can tell how each wound was made? - Tell us. - But... Fukutaro... Fukutaro doesn't matter. Establish I was in the passenger seat from my injuries. Why not ask me? Isn't this prejudice? You too. You should be grilling him on this point. The shoe and spanner are irrelevant, are you stupid? Er, the defendant makes a rather good point. It seems the occupants of the car... were frantically trying to escape a car flooded with seawater. So in these circumstances, isn't it difficult to judge exactly how any damage occurred? Er... well, I can't be entirely certain. - No more questions. - Your honor. Proceed. Certainly, the accused may have caused damage to the car's body here and there. But as there was a sufficiently high chance... of a causal link between the damage to the luggage rack and Fukutaro's knees, you concluded he was in the passenger seat? Correct. No further questions. Your honor. Proceed. It seems this establishes an essential point in the case, so the defence will petition the court for a crash test. You testified that on the night of the incident, at quay A, Shinko Bay, you witnessed the vehicle in this case race past a phone booth you were using. How do you know it was that vehicle? Because I knew the incident happened at 7:20pm... and the car passed by just before that, at 18 or 19 minutes past. Based on the timing, I believe it was the car. How do you recall the time so exactly? Because I'd agreed to meet my girlfriend there at 7 o'clock. But she hadn't come, so I called her apartment at 7:15pm. I clearly recall checking my watch. How were the light conditions? It was raining, so it was really dark. But as I'd parked my car close by with the headlights left switched on, the passengers in the passing car could be seen in the light. Well then, could you see inside when it wasn't in the light? No, I don't think so. So it was only visible for a matter of seconds? Yes. What color car was it? Ivory. Er, here... are the records of your interview with the police... and your statement to the prosecutor's office. According to these, you told the police the car was white, but you stated it was ivory to the prosecutor's office. Why is that? Well... it's because I heard the car was actually an ivory color. I learned that due to halation it appeared to be white in the headlights. I take it that afterwards someone told you the color was really ivory. Yes. This will demonstrate... Er, from the relative positions in this diagram. You were talking in a public phone box. Here's the right side of the car as it headed toward the wharf. You saw the driver's side illuminated by your car headlights. Correct? Yes. I saw a female figure dressed in white in the driver's seat. You're sure it was a woman? Yes. Do you know what color clothing Fukutaro was wearing at the time? No. Pale beige. Just now you said halation had made ivory appear white. Might not beige also appear white due to the same effect? Your honor. The defence is enjoining the witness. Whether the accused was the one driving or not... forms the crux of this case. This is incriminating evidence based on a vague impression, so it needs clarifying. Objection overruled. Hey, your honor. What is it? You, say what really happened. What? Weren't you chatting with your girlfriend? You wouldn't be paying attention to what was outside. But... I saw it! You do realise? I might get the death penalty because of you. Your honor! The defendant's remark is intimidation of the witness. Discussions on applying the death penalty are for the future... and can't have a direct influence on evidence here. Please erase it. Because he's an irresponsible bastard! - Mrs. Shirakawa! - Bastard? Be quiet! Doubtless you've something to say as well, but please confer with your lawyer. Because I was in the passenger seat. Mrs. Shirakawa! You bandied something about, now you can't back out of it. That's not true! Then you wanted your name in the papers. You're wrong! I'm here to give a true testimony in the name of justice! Justice? Lay off! I saw you in the driver's seat! I've no doubt it was you! Don't you realise you let him make a telling comment. Come on! You incited him to state you were the driver. What's the big deal? He obviously got wound up by my questions. Anyone could see that. That doesn't help. It remains on record as witness testimony. The judge is replaced in any retrial, so the record is significant. It isn't rescinded. That's the reality inside a courtroom. Please bear it in mind. Your name? Tokie Horiuchi. Age? Age? As per the court appearance card. Address? 8, 5-Chome, Hyakunincho district, the Shinjuku ward, in Tokyo. Occupation? I run the "Blue Flag" club in Tokyo. When was the first time that Fukutaro met the defendant, who was working at your establishment? It was on Christmas evening, 25th December, 1979. For seven years? So this turns you on? It does? Don't give me that! Mama! Ma-ma! What! Hey, this gentleman says it's been seven years. Oh, you're a homo? It's not that... I'm just getting too old. Listen... are you hungry? Take good care of him. You've a penchant for Grey Romance. Go on Mr. Shirakawa, be a man. We're not in Toyama! No, really, I'm not... Liar. Did you explain to the defendant beforehand... the type of customer Fukutaro was? Yes, of course. I said he's the richest man in Toyama and had been single since his wife died. So from the start, knowing that Fukutaro had considerable wealth, the defendant actively tried to get close to him. Yes. They became intimate that very day. Rich guys from the sticks succumb to her type. Come on, you told me to. I don't say things like that. I know about you. The defendant must stop interrupting! Thanks to me she swindled a fortune from Tachibana. Mrs. Shirakawa! It's true. You turn up at a place like this after all the profit I made for you. Be quiet! When did you let me make a profit? You poached the regulars for yourself. On top of that, you left without repaying an advance. I lost out. You're close to Matsui's chief director, Tachibana, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Just now the defendant suggested you'd received money from Tachibana. Is that true? Is this the tax office? Your honor. Questions over cash affairs have nothing to do with this case. Defence counsel, what do you intend to show? The witness has testified the defendant freely went after Fukutaro's fortune. But actually, she knew the negotiations between her client Matsui Commerce... and Shirakawa Breweries on the issue of Sanrin Trading had hit the rocks. The suspicion exists she planned to smooth... those negotiations by making the defendant pursue Fukutaro. I want to make that point clear. What an ignoramus. Your honor, let me tell her something. Isn't it obvious women string men along for money? Our customers are aware of that too. I've been in this business for thirty years. If it's about men and women, I've been round the block far more often than you. It's a fine line between cheating or being cheated. So you can go far as a lawyer without knowing that. Pay attention to your husband. He'll leave you if you're not careful. No further questions. But that guy Fukutaro was naive in dealing with such things. When someone like that loses out, nothing can be done. You get it? He was the one who started to fall in love. I didn't even pester him for an apartment. He took it upon himself to look for one. And he made me quit the bar. He couldn't stop worrying... that I'd be unfaithful to him. So it was great at first. What was great? The sex. Hey! Aah! Look, hold on a bit! Christ, you're tearing it! Wait a moment... Oh God! I still have to get home! Wait a minute, OK? However... Not in the hole. I'd been thinking how much he likes it. But he was out of practice. Impotence struck. Wasn't keeping me faithful too much for him? What's the matter? What's with that face! Look, cheer up. Don't worry. It's fine, it's fine, right? It's fine, it's fine. Hmm... one more try? Once more. How about a drink then? Huh? It hurts! Kumako, marry me! What? Marry me. Marry me, Kumako. What's got into you all of a sudden? I can't do it any more. The thought of you in Tokyo, alone, drives me mad. Marry me and come to Toyama. Hell no. You don't like me? It's not that, but living in a backwater like Toyama... Toyama isn't a backwater! It has everything! You can live as you like. I'll do anything for you. I promise. So please marry me. Come on, Kumako! Please! Kumako! Because we heard she'd been working in clubs and bars... it had been anticipated. Nevertheless, it was... too much. As for the president's wedding, even if it was a remarriage, the ceremony must be worthy of a family with the Shirakawa's pedigree. However, madam said it would be shameful with such a bride. Of course, my colleagues and I were of the same opinion. It was the president himself who made it official. When we were told of it later we were amazed and so too was madam. No, not at all. The president was inveigled by that woman. I think it's obvious. Because he had a sensitive and generous side to him, sadly... This woman... Once it was official, she took on a haughty air. That she displayed an insolent attitude, even towards madam, I found intolerable. Yes, madam admitted him into the family home. You could hardly leave the son and heir at the side of a woman like that! You know, the president really doted on his son Muneharu-chan. It was clear to us that when his son left... the president was dejected. However... I believe the step madam took was the correct one. Yes. Anyway, she has wasteful habits, and gets drunk and disorderly, and she's dissolute. I had a horrendous time of it, for sure. Just stop it! Treat me with some respect! You're late! See, he's here! Tell them unambiguously that I'm your wife. Tell them! They think I won't pay. No, far from it! Shirakawa is all mine. But I had no idea you were Mr. Shirakawa's... - I'm very sorry. - Hey... Make them apologise! Make them apologise! I was the one who called all the relatives together. Anyway... this woman posed a serious problem to the Shirakawas. I cottoned on straight away, when I heard the talk of marriage. She was obviously after the money. And yet the law is inconsistent. My sister set up residence, married to Fukutaro... and maintained the Shirakawa home over many decades. But that ended when she suddenly died. If the husband dies...well, specifically, in the situation here, I don't see why half the fortune goes wholly to the second wife. Not that the Shirakawa fortune concerns me directly. I was worried for Muneharu. Muneharu is my sister's only child. Actually, I wanted to tell the Shirakawas to straighten things out. Get a divorce, divorce her. Consider your responsibilities as the current head of Shirakawa Breweries. Do you know what they're saying in town? The Shirakawas' president is under the thumb. Deplorable! You're bringing disgrace on the whole family. Now, now, everyone. Separating after all this time isn't so simple. You can offer her money. 10 or 20 million... Now, if you don't listen to his side... he'll dig his heels in too. Have you some thoughts about it? Of course, it can't go on like this... After a year or two, then certainly... You'll leave her? Yes. I'm willing to. I don't believe you. You're saying you'll separate in the future somehow. Consider how old you are now. That woman gets a large part of the estate if anything happens to you. What about your son who'll be left behind? You seem content to crush the Shirakawa family tradition in one generation. That's what Harue is saying. Look, I never intended to leave the estate to that... to Kumako. But you entered her into the family register. Um... it's hard to suggest this. I've given it some consideration. What is it? Well, seeing as I'm connected to Muneharu by blood... I wouldn't like to be misunderstood. However, thinking about the Shirakawa family... You're Shizue's younger brother. Please speak freely. Actually, at this juncture... it may be advisable to transfer the whole Shirakawa fortune to Muneharu. Muneharu? Yes. The tax on gifts is significantly higher, but it's better than that woman getting it. I see. That sounds reasonable. Yes, I agree. It would be reassuring if you do that as Muneharu will eventually inherit it. But... Muneharu is still at junior high school. Why do I have to be made to endure that!? I'll spread it around to everyone! Your relatives are trying to drive out your new wife. I don't see why I should leave. Kumako, please stop this. Don't say please to me. Don't you understand? You've been hoodwinked too. From the start, your ex-wife's brother was aiming to squeeze you out... by becoming your son's legal guardian. They'll all be having a big laugh about it. No such thing, they're not like that. Why do you always see the other side? You don't say anything in front of that old woman. This is stupid! I wouldn't mind if we separated. Kumako. Pay me compensation. Not a paltry 10 or 20 million. Give me at least 100 million. Ah! Insurance? Insurance? Because you're broke, aren't you? Is there anything else? Then that's the only way. How am I going to live when you die? Hey. I'm young, you know! I need the means to live. How will I get by without money? Perhaps it hasn't sunk in yet? Hey. Do you love me? Hey... do you love me? I love you! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Get insured, right! Get insured! Get insured! Quickly! Fill all of them! 100 million or so is no good, so do as many as you can! Hey, get insured! Do it! I will. You took out a number of plans which had extremely high premiums. Paying out ten-fold in a calamity. In other words it is worth 3 million at maturity, but if there is an unexpected accident it changes to 30 million. Because he was nearly sixty. Also he went fishing all year round, even though he couldn't swim. I think about the future too. I wasn't going to kill him or anything. But I wonder if they'll believe that. One has to be able to show there was no concrete plan to kill him. Demonstrating that is your job. Don't get sloppy just because you're a state-selected lawyer. Listen, in return... I'll pay you a handsome fee when I collect the insurance money. So pull your finger out a bit. What are you going on about? The accused and her lawyer are together in the same boat. It goes round in circles or capsizes if they don't concur. Just remember that. When was the last time you went fishing with Fukutaro Shirakawa? Yes. It was just about one month before he died. How did he seem? Well, he didn't look well and I sensed he was completely worn out, so I wondered if he was ill. Did he say anything to you about the defendant on that occasion? Yes, he did. What did he say? Well, it was shocking. He said, "Sooner or later that woman will kill me." "Getting married to her was a huge mistake." "Anyway, she's obstinate, hysterical and greedy." "If I don't find a way out soon," "I'll be killed." I thought this is a serious matter. I'd heard the various rumors about his wife. "That woman will kill me." Did Fukutaro tell you specifically what he meant by that? Specifically? Yes. Perhaps he had evidence she was trying to kill him. Or she'd tried to kill him. Or she told him she'd kill him. Not particularly... So Fukutaro wasn't saying... he sensed the defendant had a definite plan? I suppose not. But he actually said he'd be killed. It was definite. But aren't phrases like that... regularly used casually, as a joke? For example, "My wife will wring my neck?" Or, "I'm being worked to death"? Haven't you heard those sorts of expressions? I have. But this time it didn't feel that way. Or why would I come here? That's how it came across. Then why didn't you... notify the police at once? Well, it's... You felt Fukutaro's words were sincere, didn't you? So wouldn't it be natural to inform the police? But at the time I didn't think it would turn out... In other words, you didn't take it seriously? No more questions. 8TH JULY 13TH HEARING When did you learn that the defendant had married Fukutaro? Ah!...around the middle of April, 1980. I'd just been released on parole from Fuchu Prison after doing time for fraud. Kumako had already left for Toyama. You haven't seen the defendant since then? I have. Actually, just the once. They met? You did meet? When and where? In August that year I went to Toyama... and called Kumako from the station. She responded? Yes. She came in a car to pick me up. We had a meal in town and went for a short drive. At the end we went to the coast. Whereabouts? Shinko Harbour. That's a lie. Why are you telling lies? It's no lie. We went there together. You're up to something. You must stop interrupting. If you have something to say, please convey it to your lawyer. What did the defendant say to you at Shinko Harbour? She spoke of the Kennedy incident. Kennedy incident? Yes, it is a tale that actually happened in America. A man by the name of Edward Kennedy crashed a car into a river. [The "Chappaquiddick Incident"] He caused the death of a woman travelling with him. It was often in the tabloids. Kumako took it as an example. She said in that sort of situation you wouldn't get caught, as long as you insisted it was accidental. Don't tell them that! Mrs. Shirakawa. You grass. Grass? In prison, they call someone like you 'a grass'. You should know, you're a jailbird! He's spent most of his life in prison. You're a fine one to talk! Quiet! Quiet! I'm telling the truth. She said if it went well I'd get a share. You Judas! Mrs. Shirakawa! - Who bought you? - Stop it! Please control yourself! Leave! Have her removed. Why do I have to leave!? You want to kick me out and have some bullshit trial! You can't be serious! You're deciding whether I live or die. I won't accept being ignored! Free my hands! You wait! You'll regret this! Free my hands! Free my hands! Free my...! We'll have a 30-minute recess. Defence counsel, please consult with your client. Why obstruct the testimony? Because... I can't stay silent when someone lies like that. They all think you're a murderer with eyes on the insurance money. There are many defendants who interrupt damaging evidence in desperation. You want to appear like that? That was some performance, if you are guilty. Congratulations. When she said her husband was insured for about 300 million, I was taken aback. The thought she intended to copy the Kennedy incident was shocking. I said it's fine if you alone survive. But if you both end up dying you lose everything. Actually, a long time ago I crashed a car into a river. The windscreen didn't break and I came close to drowning. However, Kumako laughed when I told her that. She said, "You can just shatter it with a hammer or something." "Petty crime gets you nowhere." "I'll take a chance." "If it works out you'll get 50 million yen." That's what she told me. You've been interviewed previously by the police? Yes. Why didn't you give this testimony then? Because I had been with Kumako a long time and I didn't want to speak against her. Why are you willing to express it now? Earlier on, I wasn't fully aware of the circumstances. But is it not... that in your world you set great store on loyalty to your friends? That's true. But it's a serious matter when a person dies. I want to see justice done too. I believe you've provided a lot of material to the Hokuriku Daily Report. About the defendant's days in Hakata and Ginza that only you know. Is there a special connection... with that newspaper? No, there isn't. I don't like the police, so I spoke to a paper. So you also informed the paper of this matter without telling the police? That's right. Because I was asked. And I'm here because I was told to inform the police. No choice, I guess. Oh, I see. So you've turned up here today... because you were told to by a newspaper. Give me a break! I felt I had to testify! As I said before, it's justice... Mrs. Shirakawa! Stop it. The defendant must desist. Next time you'll be restrained. Imbecile. Jesus. You testified that the defendant said she'd give you 50 million if successful. What was that 50 million yen about? That's... my cut. Of what? Look, from the murder proceeds. Hang on a minute. I wasn't helping her or anything. I'm not involved! That was just a manner of speaking. Purely talk. What makes you think that? Tell me the reason. Because at the time she seemed in a bad temper... and she got carried away. She's the type who tends to talk big. As if she'd give me 50 million. If the talk of 50 million yen wasn't meant literally, don't you think it's the same with the murder scheme? But she actually killed him. Objection. These are excessively leading questions. Since the accident occurred, it has been reported in the media day after day. Er, they give the impression... the judgement is a foregone conclusion. It has been a great hindrance to the truth emerging. I've continued questioning this witness because it seems there's a chance... he twisted the defendant's words on the basis of that preconception. Since the tendency of which the defence speaks is acknowledged... and it's a cross-examination, how about trying to answer? Well then? Don't you think the mention of the murder plan was also simply angry talk? I don't think so. I think she killed him. And what's your opinion? She didn't do it? Just answer the question. You can't ask that. Of course, I don't believe she did it. Silence!...Calm down! Calm down! 16TH AUGUST PLUNGE TESTING Well, get the door. Okay, lower! Okay... we're done! This was captured by a camera inside the car. It's car 1. Yes. Wow... that's pretty amazing. Um, the cause for the windscreen breaking? For this one, the impact with the surface of the water. Car 2. That's a considerable impact. The same for Car 2? Yes. Hmm, it didn't break. It broke later on, when underwater. The water pressure alone can break it? We have to examine that question further. I wonder if it was then? Well, anyway, there are many conditions in which the windscreen breaks. It's not easy to establish if it was broken by the spanner. But even assuming the spanner wasn't used, I expect it was there for that reason. But maybe it was there due to other circumstances. Aside from that, there's something else yet to be explained. The shoe. From Fukutaro's left foot. Well, it's likely someone struggling against a deluge of water, could lose a shoe by chance. Yes. Who is it? Ah sensei, it's me. Toyosaki. Sorry to come at this late hour. What is it? There's something I'd like to say. I wonder if you'd let me in. Ah! You needn't be afraid. What do you want to say? Actually... I think I did something bad to Kumako. I felt sure she'd killed him. Then you said she didn't do it. The more I think about it, the more I agree with you. It'll be on my conscience if she gets the death sentence. - Come in. - Excuse me. I'm still not sure myself, about whether she's lying or telling the truth. Yes, that's what she's like. Is she capable of killing someone? Could she? I suppose you know her better than anyone? Well, it's possible she could kill someone on impulse. When she gets mad she loses control of herself. But plotting to kill someone... Ah! She was expelled from the courtroom due to her antics. That's it. Once the red mist descends her judgement is completely clouded. It was the same in Ginza. Ginza? When the club in Ginza collapsed... Thanks a lot. She confronted a hostess and gave her a real beating. Right, when she got a three-year jail sentence? Yeah, yeah. The club in Ginza was her dream. In her way she poured everything into it. I think it was quite a shock when it turned out like that. Even so, killing someone is so brutal. Well, it was traumatic. Thank you. It's good! Ah, sensei! I... Once I saw her at the point of tears. I went to pick her up when she was released from prison. Hey, Kuma. Sorry I'm late. What's up? Come on, get in. What's wrong? LOVE HOTEL Ah, I'm hungry. Let's eat something. What's got into you? Bringing me here. Just for a moment, she could have been an ordinary girl. Irresistibly lovely. Women are strange. Then... It's a lie that you heard a murder plot from the defendant's lips! That's right. Certainly we spoke of such things. But she didn't suggest it. It was me who told her to kill him. And you're saying that you also brought up the Kennedy incident. Look! It was in a news weekly I found on a train. I showed it to Kumako. Then why didn't you say so earlier? Why come out with it now? Because... I realised I'd had a lapse of memory. Don't you have those? Don't mock this court! Your behaviour is most irresponsible! Then can I be clear? Go ahead. I was worried how the police would perceive me. What? The police are devious. I'm on parole and from the start they threatened me with a return to jail. I let those guys say what they like. Be careful what you say. Try to testify accurately and in detail what the police said to you! Obviously they don't leave a trail of evidence. The written record too. It was waved in front of my face and duly signed. That's how the police work. You can't get away with perjury! Look, I'm stating the truth! Should I stay silent about this? Are you saying it's not perjury if I keep lying? I've remembered something else. That talk with Kumako. It was at a restaurant, not by the sea. Stop this nonsense. It's true. You know, I had that journalist Akitani show me the scene of the incident. Amongst other things, I learnt that the windscreen was broken. So... I thought why not say I spoke with Kumako there? I wanted to add some spice when it came to writing up the story. He's here in person. You can ask him. Jesus, you should've made this clear before. You're shameless! I know, it's inexcusable! Actually, the newspaper provided a few favours. No more questions. Defence, any final questions? Not really. Shall we conclude? Then the witness may step down. Ah, your honor! What? May I say something? What is it? Sensei, please take care of matters. And you, give it your best shot! I'm very much obliged. With this you'll be back in the slammer. Then, the trial is over for today. Stand! It's as he said, the police employ underhand methods! Journos are no better, clinging to them like lice. Don't look down on me in that condescending way. Did you see the prosecutor's face? Serves him right. Such a great feeling. Don't be complacent. It's only gone against you more and more. Why's that? It came out in court that you refined a murder plan for the insurance money, inspired by the Kennedy incident. Didn't it? That's evidence of intent to kill. You only ever see things negatively. It's almost like you want me to be found guilty. I'm not defending you out of kindness. I'm just thinking about my professional responsibilities. Don't misunderstand. OK? Papa! Welcome back. See you later. Take care. Bye bye. Bye bye. - Where did you go to? - The park! There were lots of carp and goldfish. Hello, Muneharu? I'm the lawyer, Sahara. I know, I've seen you defending that woman. Could we have a chat? Just five minutes will do. But I have to be home early. I'll take you, come on. I've brought various things to light in this trial. But I've wondered... if it wasn't you whom your father loved most, rather than that woman. You loved your father too? Whose wish was it... that you leave your father's place? Your own? Or was it grandma or someone else? I suggested it. I hated that woman. And... I hated father when he was with her. When was the last time you saw him? I forget. Ah, you mustn't tell fibs. In this trial... everyone just lies to suit themselves. The truth is entirely clouded. That's grown-ups for you. No good, eh? But you should rise above those grown-ups. Don't you remember? When was the last time you saw him? Last year. The 10th of July. July the 10th? The day before the incident then. What did the two of you talk about? Didn't your father say anything? He didn't say anything important. He wanted to take me for a drive and I refused. That's all. I see. So that was all. Oh, Muneharu. Will you take the witness stand? What! Simply say what you told me. It's a pain. It's highly significant that you saw your father the day before he died. No one's testified about that so far, so nobody knows. Only you can speak about your father's demeanour at the time. Alright? You'll get a summons from the court later. Okay? Stand! We'll now commence the trial of the case concerning Kumako Shirakawa. I believe today there is a defence witness. Before that, I'd like to illustrate something that happened to me. Er, regarding the unresolved issue of the spanner and the shoe left in the car. Please do. The other day, while driving my car, I nearly caused an accident. It was caused by an empty juice can getting caught under the brake, rendering it unusable. Er, as a result... I formed a hypothesis from the incident. The gap between the floor and brake in Fukutaro's car is exactly 7 centimetres. The width of this shoe belonging to Fukutaro... is 6.7 centimetres. So it fits neatly. To wedge it in, an object of about 3 millimetres is necessary. And this spanner is exactly 4 millimetres thick. Wedge it in here... and the brake pedal gets jammed. No matter how you tread on it, the brake won't function. But... what exactly are you trying to establish? Right... Er, it's conceivable, that having resolved to die, Fukutaro tampered with the brake because he feared unwittingly... stepping on it as the car was about to plunge into the sea. Then... you're saying he killed himself? Correct. The defence counsel is engaging in wild speculation! Call it a hypothesis all you like. Is there clear evidence supporting it? Not really. Therefore I'm hoping today's witness can substantiate it. Then let the witness take the stand. Oath: I hereby swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Muneharu Shirakawa. Since we've now taken an oath from you, bear in mind that should you give false testimony in these proceedings, you will face being punished. Okay? Yes. Er, on the 10th of July 1981, that is, the night before the incident, you saw your father Fukutaro, didn't you? Yes. Whereabouts? Our family home's... father approached outside my room. Where outside your room exactly? The back garden. What time? It was after 11. Did your father say anything to you? He wanted us to go for a drive. But I refused. And then? Was that all he said to you that day? Surely it was more than that. No, not really... That was all. So, although he intended to invite you for a drive, he came through the back garden, in order not to be noticed? In his own house? Presumably, your father wanted to see only you. He wanted to tell you something. What was it? Can't you say? You can't tell us? Objection, the witness has answered. No further response is needed. It may be injurious to the witness himself. The witness is suppressing evidence because he resents the defendant. Er, the fate of the defendant hangs on an important fact that he's hiding. It won't be harmful to the witness himself, so please let him testify. Objection dismissed. The witness shall answer. Come, Muneharu, tell us. Your father came to do what? You took an oath didn't you? To tell the whole truth? You'd lie in court? Father... had a letter... Letter? You received a letter? Where is it? It's gone. I burnt it at the funeral wake. Try telling us what was inside. Muneharu? If you don't tell us now, you'll have to keep it hidden the rest of your life. You'll have to bear that load all your life. Are you okay with that? Isn't that unwelcome? I don't think your deceased father would be happy either. Muneharu! "I will..." "I will kill Kumako..." That's what was inside. "For this family's sake." "And... for your sake." "My duty is to kill Kumako." You can't be serious. What did I do to deserve that? You ruined the Shirakawa family! Seeking its wealth... you came to destroy the Shirakawas! Don't give me that. Your old man asked me to come, you know. I came because he begged me to. And the old fossil tries to kill me. Don't slight my father! Please tone down your remarks! Come, Muneharu, continue. What was written after that? "Kumako is no good." "But I'm in love with her." "Letting her die alone would be too heartbreaking." "So I will die alongside her." "Forgive my weakness." "Please try to find happiness." So a forced double suicide! How foolish! He screwed it up and died himself. In which case, I'm in the clear. What insolent people. You're the one who drove him to it! You killed my father! "YOU KILLED HIM!" CAR PLUNGE INCIDENT WAS FORCED DOUBLE SUICIDE (14TH OCTOBER) We now pronounce judgement... on the case concerning Kumako Shirakawa. Come forward. "Main Text: the accused is not guilty." "The reasons as follows." WICKED WOMAN KUMAKO IN NOT GUILTY VERDICT KUMAKO EMBARKS ON 300 MILLION INSURANCE PAYOUT CLAIM Hello. Hello. Ah, is that lawyer Sahara? It's Akitani of the Daily Report. Congratulations on your victory. Well done. Thank you. How is it? I bet you get angry phone calls. Yes, I do. How does it make you feel? How? You're not bothered? No, not particularly. Everyone's mad. If she'd committed a crime then... but that wasn't the case. So proving her innocent is normal. I see. I'm surprised. So that's the way a lawyer thinks. Completely different from the likes of us. I was transferred thanks to this. I'm now at the Uozu office. But I don't regret it. We don't need to defend a woman like that in a newspaper. She must be utterly condemned. I still detest that woman. That's right, even now! Aya-chan... do you like them? Sorry I'm late. Aya-chan? Yeah... she's here. Where? Sakie's here too. She's dying to speak with you. Will you see her? Wow, there's loads of them. Hey. I don't resent you or anything. I guess Tetsuro said so? So I don't need an apology from you. I'm content with being able to see Ayako once a month. Tetsuro and I are no longer involved. No... That's not what I wanted to see you about. Could you stop meeting Aya-chan? I don't think this situation is good for her. So... But this is a condition of the divorce settlement. I know that. So I'm asking you. Please. Give up on it now. Please don't make us suffer any further. When did I make you suffer? Ayako is my child. Only I have the right to say that. I can't have children. I intend to raise Aya-chan with the belief she's mine. - Aya-chan. - Yes. - Here, a present. - Thank you. Welcome. Ah, sensei!...Sensei. - Please! - Here you are. Don't just stand there. A glass, bring a glass. Wine, wine, wine! Yes, please. Anyway, she saved me, serve her a drink. Yeah, she gets everyone off the hook. Wow. Cheers! Thank you, sensei. Hey sensei, something else happened. I can't celebrate, advise me. What is it? The insurance firms won't pay the 300 million yen. They say I can't claim for a suicide within a year of taking out the cover. You know that, it's in the contract. That may be so, but it's not like he killed himself for the insurance money. You're a lawyer, there must be some way. If I can't get the 300 million, there was no point in coming to Toyama. My luck's out. No chance, give it up. Then what about reparations from the Shirakawa family? I need to teach them a little lesson after what I suffered. Come on, it goes both ways; and they detest you as well. He killed himself because you drove him to it. I shouldn't have done that? So what if one or two people have died? It wasn't really love. He just wanted to tie me down because he feared I'd leave him. Don't give me that crap about a double suicide. On the whole, you did a lousy job. I'll lose the insurance money because you used that clumsy defence. I was thinking of giving you around 50 million. You messed it up. 300 million yen up in smoke. What would you have done if Fukutaro hadn't set up that double suicide? Could you have killed him or not? Which is it? You may be gutless, but please stop pretending. Yes, right, of course. I think I would've, given a chance. There's a real nasty expression on your face. You always see people as guinea pigs. I truly loathe self-indulgent egotists like yourself. And I hate women like you. No matter how evil or shameful you may find it, I don't care about others. That's why I like me. And you? Could you say you like yourself? Probably not. A pathetic specimen. I hate all women like you. You're disgusting. You should be thankful your life was spared. Don't think I'm put off. I've gained confidence from this. I'll continue to live in my own way, thankful I didn't become a woman like you. I'll keep using men until the end. I suppose that's the only way you can live. I'll go on living my way. Well, do your worst. I'll defend you when you slip up. Please do! The End
