- 5 minutes. Don't get up. - You're crazy. The kids can't be late for school. Come on, get up. I'll get your milk ready. Up, I said. - Mom, it's too hot. - Stir it. - I'll drink it anyway. - I can’t. All right. It'll cool off this way. Wait for me! Luis, don't ever do that again. See you tomorrow. Mom, he won't lend me anything! If you touch that. I'll punch you in the nose. Please! I have a splitting headache! Don't make so much noise. Try to sleep a bit. What did you break? This is the one that's wrong. How much is 7 times 8? 7 times 1,7,7 times 2 14, 7 times... How terrible! It’s 56! Write it down! Hi, Dad. - Is there hot water? - Dinner's ready. - No, I take a bath now. - Make it tomorrow morning... - and dinner now... I'm very tired. - No, no, now! The shitty program's over. Are you done? Yes. Get up, it's 7:00 already! I need to revise your exercises. Hurry up. - It's for you, mam. - Thank you. "The death of Juan Carlos Etchepare last April 18th.. at the early age of 35, after having suffered a long illness, has caused grief in this town where he was a loved one. It came to a surprise to many but not to those who were near to him and knew of his terrible illness. The remains of dear Juan Carlos were buried at the local... cemetery, accompanied by many people". "Dear Mrs. Etchepare, I've heard of the sad news, and after many doubts I decided to write saying I’m very sorry about the death of your son. I'm Nélida Fernández Massa. Nene's my nickname. Remember me? I've been living in Buenos Aires since I got married. I don't know if you still hold a grudge against me, because even before I was married, you and your daughter, were not on talking terms with me. Though you don't like me let me pray with you". Mom wasn't able to cook today. So we're going to have.. - ...what you most like. - What, Mom? Fried eggs and some cheese We'll do our best. your letter. Too bad your daughter, Celina, still despises me. I'll write to you to your post office box, as you've requested so she doesn't find out. I never thought Juan Carlos would die. A man so handsome as he was. I knew he had a lung problem when I was in the sierras. Why didn't God let me know at that moment?" There were two souls in the world that God had joined. Two souls that loved one other that was you and me. Through our bleeding wounds of our great love. We gave each other our lives as it was never done before. Are you done? No. Go to bed. I'm not sleepy. I'm going to listen to the radio Bring it to the bedroom, it doesn't bother me. Yes it does. Go to sleep, you're tired. It would be best to die. We cannot live neither near nor far apart. "Dear Mrs. Leonor, it was so comforting to receive... "Dear Mrs. Leonor, I was thrilled to receive your letter. How are you?, You sound a little better but I'm still down. I'd like to ask you for something. Please excuse me. When we were going out, Juan Carlos wrote me some letters. I know I'm a married woman with two healthy children, but at night when I wake up and can't fall back to sleep, it would be very comforting if I could read those letters again. When we broke up, we gave our letters back. I sent them to him tied with a blue ribbon... because they were letters from a boy. We fought over silly things, things that were big then. But that was another time in my life. What a lovely son you had, mam. Sometimes I think of that... and I hope its true that after life, the soul is resurrected. RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH So if you find those letters, please send them to me. "Dear Mrs. Leonor, it's been over a month since I wrote you and I still have received a reply. You wouldn’t believe the things I think of. If you didn't get my letter, who knows where it might be? After that one, I wrote you another one. Didn't you receive that one either? I only feel well when I'm alone. I darken my room and I just lay there. I make pretend I'm with you and that we go to Juan Carlos' tomb. And that we both cry until we feel relief. This morning I went to the zoo again. It's near my home. The kids told my boys that there was a baby tiger. So we went. It was beautiful. Just like a baby. Too bad children grow so fast. They get to be wild. Boys are so tiresome. I have to be so strict with them. They're not so cute. I shouldn't say this but my kids are ugly. Not even the boys are comforting to me. What have I done to deserve this? I'm going to die with the kind of life I lead. And to top it off, you don't write to me. What's wrong? Has someone said something bad about me? - You look terrible. - My usual face. Have you gone mad? I'm talking to you. Answer me! You'll pay for this. Don't look at me. Keep studying. I'm telling you these things so that you know I wasn't to blame. I wasn't the one who took advantage of your son, It was another woman. Celina became a spinster, that's why she's mad at me. Since she has a lot of free time, without children... nor a husband to take care let her discover... Juan Carlos' real killer." Mom, it's broken. PAINTED LIPS HEARTBREAK TANGO Regards, Isabel. June, 1936. To my mother and little sister. Juan Carlos. 1937. "This morning I remembered Dr. Asquero. And I felt bad about it. I never liked him. Juan Carlos was the only one I loved. While I'm at it, let me tell you how foolish I was. How I was marked forever at 20 when I began studying to be a nurse". Goodbye. - What an awful cough. - I've had it for two days. You should take care of yourself. Let me listen to your chest. - No, thank you. Don't bother. - It's no problem. - There's patients outside. - Take that off a minute. All right. Sit down. Sorry. Don't get angry. It's my fault. I should've seen another doctor. Ask the next patient in. Who's next? Nené, ask the doctor where he wants to have his coffee. He has a lot of patients now, I know when my husband has to eat. "How stupid I was. One day we had to do a blood transfusion at a ranch. The woman had a hemorrhage but got cured thanks to us. Before we left, they offered us some wine. Everyone was happy and I drank. Upon our return..." We won't get to town for another half hour. Lie back. I am quite tired. Go to sleep. "And I'm wasting ink talking about that dirty act. My foolishness turned out to be quite expensive. After that, we started seeing each other anywhere. Even in the office, with his wife right outside. Later she found out and yelled at us in front of the maid. So I had to work as a cashier at the store. He never called me again. - Here you are. - Thanks. What are you doing here? - What do you want? - A towel. Nené, do you like being here? Yes but don't forget what you promised. I didn't tell anyone. I swear to God. If you say a word, God will punish you. Remember I got you the job you have at the doctor's. I don't want to work there any more. He looks at my legs all the time and it scares me. Take it. Look, there's Mabel. Ask her to give me a job at her house. - Does she know you want to go? - Yes, I've asked her already. Go, here she comes. I'll ask her. Goodbye, Mabel. Poor Raba. To think we went to school together. - Two desks apart, right? - Yes, two desks. But our lives turned out to be completely different. That’s the way it is. Do you want anything? There's some nice material in the window. But I also came in because I wanted to tell you something. - Guess what? - They accepted me! I told you Dad does anything he wants at the club. So there's a rehearsal at 10:00. Dad'll take us in the car. Thanks. And what about Celina? Not her Because of the gowns, you know. She's too short. She'll get mad. Just because we went to school together, do we have to do... Everything together? Does that mean that Raba has to come too? So Raba’s been accepted at your house. I don't know if Mom wants her. Be careful. She has a big mouth. She makes up stories. Now I'll repeat, and pay attention. There's three different waltz eras. We'll start rehearsing the steps when Juan Carlos gets here. We've rehearsed for two days and this man hasn't shown up. Nené, I'm furious. I've been left out of the festival. No, Celina. It's just that the gowns are all from Buenos Aires. And they come in medium size. Since you're a little short... Look, you started coming to the club thanks to me. - You should be helping me out. - Don't be unfair, Celina. You don't plan on helping me? What's so interesting? That's what I'd like to know. So you finally showed up. OK everybody, stand up. Come here everyone. You two. And you over here. And you two. The three waltz eras. THE THREE WALTZ ERAS From the prodigy of the immortal past. a virtuous voice arises in its compass. And in that voice the heart soaks comforted, and the angel dances the melodious waltz. Don't be like that. Take your hand away. I won't go any further. - I have to tell you something. - Not now. - It's about your mother. - What about her? I saw her at the store and she looked away. Don't pay attention to her. Your sister doesn't talk to me any more either. She wanted you to marry Mabel. I told you not to talk about her any more. Fine. But why are you so angry? - Forget about it. OK? - OK. Be good. Close your eyes. For what? I want to see your eyelashes. I like to look at them. They're like bird wings. The wings of an eagle. - You know what? - Now what? Your face is flawless. That's nice. And don't get mad if I talk about Mabel. I'm not jealous of her. But I am of someone else though. - Now I think you're stupid. - Even though you don't like it. I've been wanting to tell you something for some time now. Everyone says that your cold won't go away. and that you don't go to work because you're out on the town. That you gamble and go out with the widow. - That's over. And I don't.. - Look at your handkerchief. Leave it alone. It's an expensive one. It's a girl's... Bye. "If Juan Carlos left me and went to see another girl, It's because he acted like a gentleman to me. I wasn't the one who took advantage of him every night. Who really killed Juan Carlos? Where did he go after kissing me at the door? Where?" Hey, professional tramp wait a minute! What are you doing Still up, you bum? You're probably going to see the widow. Stop it. I told you I left her a while ago. You're a bastard. With so many women you forgot your friends. I felt like going to the river. but not alone. We can go whenever you want. If you've got the money, you bum I'm not going to pay for your women. I'll pay for yours, so don't bug me. Let's go now. - No, I’ve got a date. Some other time. - When? Tomorrow I'm off. I'll pick you up in the afternoon. Don't stand me up. I know where you're going. I know where you're going: to hell, you bum. Stuck up, gentleman's ass! Go change your face. You won't get any woman like that. I'll beat your brains out tomorrow! You're bad No kissing. Let's keep what we promised. That's for the English guy, isn't it? If you don't take care of yourself, you won't get better. I told you not to come tonight. - Has the English guy arrived? - Tomorrow. From the ranch. Well? I made you a promise and I'll keep it. But before getting married. If not, people will start talking. He didn't say no, he said he'd think about it. Tomorrow I'll try to make him promise. If he's got two ranches, he can't be at both... at the same time. And the manager's like being the owner of one of them. If I keep my promise, you have to keep yours. You know that I just care about you. The day my English boyfriend names you manager of the ranch. you'll have to leave Nené. Why don’t you leave her now? - You have to keep your promise. - I'm so jealous. I don't care about her. I love you. Why do we have to hide? It's your fault for not talking to my dad. - and for not taking care of yourself. - I'm better. You have to go see the doctor tomorrow. He has the X-ray. - And if I'm fine? - I never told you something. Not now. The doctor called Dad and told him you were sick. That's why he made me leave you. The X-ray will show that my chest is fine. But you can pass it on through your mouth. - I'll be cured soon. - I want to kiss you. We can't do it. Maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow? - I'll go. - Pass. I'll go. Pass. - Etchepare, telephone. - I'll be right back. - Hello. - How are you, son? How are you, doctor? Fine. Just old. At least you got to be old. Your X-rays came in from Buenos Aires this morning. I just came in and I haven't seen then yet. You haven't? Or are you hiding something from me? Come over when you can. OK. See you later, doctor. It's a good thing I'm losing, otherwise you wouldn't believe I have to go. It's OK by me. Shall we continue at 6:00? OK. At 6:00. I have ten. I'll come with you. - Going somewhere? - Just two blocks. I'm going to the corral. Why don't you come with me? No, Dr. Malbrán's expecting me. Fresh air will do you better than the doctor. You're right. The corral, isn't far and I won't be long there. Behind that field was my grandfather's. Why was it lost? It wasn't lost. They stole it from me. That's awful. My father's brother was an animal. And when my dad went to Buenos Aires to study, he stayed here. My dad went to study because he was brilliant with numbers. He became an accountant. The other guy sold the field and disappeared. What's there to be done? But when my dad died, my mother never forgave him... for having left my sister and me without a dime. Health is more important. Excuse me. I'll be back in a second. "Health is more important." It's not late for you, is it? The doctor's going to be very angry. Don't forget we're playing again at 6:00. - Stop here. - What about Dr. Malbrán? I changed my mind. And thanks for the ride. - Don't forget to come at 6:00. - Of course not. Go inside. - What do you want? - Why are you so distant now? Go away. Someone might have seen you. Sorry about what time it is, but I was dying to see you. You haven’t come here for months. No one can see you at night. But now's a crazy time to come. Be good. In the sitting room? My daughter's sleeping in the bedroom. Come here. No, Juan Carlos. Not here, please Hey, tramp. How are you? Since when do you like working? Shut up. I have to prove the sheriff I can do it. so he'll send be to Buenos Aires You kept it to yourself. I can study there a year and I'll be back a police officer. - Dirty cop. - What about you? - You re working your way up. - What are you talking about? I followed you last night. But I had already suspected it. Don't tell anyone. No wonder you don't care about the girls near the river. - Isn't Nené enough for you? - What do you know about women? Take care of her. Nené's a nice girl. They're all the same. If you treat them nice, they get hard. You have to be rough. Look. - Why don't you lay her? - She's kind of ugly. What about you? You know why they call her Raba? Because her rump has got goose pimples. - You're crazy. - Listen. You have to attacks her now or someone else will beat you. Mabel told me they're going to hire her as the maid. That way you can keep an eye on Mabel for me. You can casually see her at the house while you see Raba. Mabel's the one who'll talk to you. But she's busy with her boyfriend now. We're celebrating. She'll be right here. - Who'll make the toast? - I'm not good at that. - I will. - Good. That you both get rich and buy Mom and me lots of presents. Me too. That the cattle you're selling me be as healthy as me ever since I've lived in this nice "pampa". Look, Raba. My daughter's still with her boyfriend. Now that her father's leaving, she wants to be alone with him. Who knows what they'll talk about. It's OK. I'll come back some other day. JUst one thing. You want to have your nights free? Because I don't like my maid to kiss her boyfriend at my door Don't worry about that. I don't have a boyfriend. But you will. You never fooled by anyone? No, mam. The maid we had left for that reason. She's pregnant. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - Can I walk with you? - No, thank you. Why not? Because I have to walk fast. My lady's waiting for me. When can I talk to you? I don't know. I never go out at night. Don't you go to the theater on Fridays? No, my lady's having guests for dinner. And you won't see the film? I don’t care. It's a comedy anyway. - So you only like the romantic ones? - Yes. And aren't you going to the dance on Sunday? - Maybe. - If you go, I'll go for sure. - What's the matter? - Nothing, I'm going to bed. You're sweating. - Has the X-ray arrived yet? - Not yet. That's strange. You probably didn’t go pick it up. You shut up! You shouldn't get worried like that. Before this cough I've sweated like this many times. I'll get you some clean pyjama. I hear you when you come in at night. Mom doesn't know. You're going to go on with that whore? You know about Asquero and her. The maid saw them. Shut up! How can you be out all night with that shameless woman? How can her parents permit it? I don't understand. Stay out of my life! Leave me alone! What did you do on your first day off? I rested, what else? Come here. When I left the store today, I went by the bar but... - ...you weren't there. - I was home. You kept your mom company? What else did you do? I don't like that. Why do you ask so many questions? Men do things they don't talk about, got it? They say that chamomile is poisonous. Don't bite it. They're lies. I Like its perfume. Don't forget what you promised. God will punish you if you talk. You have to attack her now. Or someone else will beat you. Hi. Do want to know the bad things or only the good ones? Both. OK. Cut with your left hand in three parts. Past, present and future. The king of Cups upside down is someone who doesn't love you. And she won't give you what you want. What you most want is money. If I'm not mistaken. 2 of spades. Look how sharp they are. They have silver ends. This is a trip by land. "Jack of golds". A blond woman that loves you and brings you luck. But be careful, I don't like blonds. The cards don't say that, I do. She puts her heart in your hand. No, wait. She rips it out and gives it to you. Hold it firmly. Don't ever let go of the blond's rotten heart. A spirit told me that a blond's heart broke open like an egg... and a big ugly bird came out. But the blond girl helps me. Cut with your left hand in three parts. 7 of cups. A wedding. Send me some rice but I hope it's not you who gets married. Because the cups are upside down and the wine falls out. I like wine, and I like you too. You're such a cutie Isn't there anything about a disease? 4 of clubs after spades. This could be a serious disease Quick, draw another one. If a 10 or an 11 comes out, you're safe. Come on. 4 of golds. Tears. But you can still be saved. aw another one. 11 of clubs. You're safe. Take the knife out of my heart, baby. By saving you. I might get the disease. Another one, quick. 6 of spades. Violent death. Somebody wants to kill you. This one again! What does it want? That 10 hadn't come out yet. I may have been confused baby Sorry. I'm not that old. Some time ago, when a boy like you came to see me, I had to put guardians outside because they all liked me. - Should I draw another one? - Yes. Let me see in the depth of your eyes. I might discover something, baby. You've drawn too many ugly cards together. I like your eyes. But I don’t see anything. I see myself... oh, no. Forgive me. I can't go on. Please forgive me. Far away from Celina. You hear me? - What would you like? - An orange soft drink. - Something hot. - There's nothing hot. - There's soft drinks, beer, brandy. - A brandy. Excuse me. - May I? - What do you want? Can I sit down? Thanks. Nené, can't you see how sick he is? - He won't take care of himself. - Shut up, I'll fix this. What do you want? I want to tell Nené what happened this afternoon. Nothing happened! Dr. Malbrán called home asking for him. Mom answered and he told her that he still hasn't gone... to pick up the X-rays. And that he's... very sick. Let's go. Please don't stay at the door with him all night. I'm dizzy. Let's go. Can I walk you home? No. I came with the mayor's maid and I have to go back with her. But I have something important to say to you. - What is it? - Not here. Outside. But I want to know. One is that I was told you work very hard. And your lady cares a lot about you. - What else? - I'll tell you outside. Then we can drop the other girl off first. And Dr. Asquero's house is on the next block. Guess what that girl said to me? That I was going to ask you out. - To be careful with you. - She's just jealous. Pancho! Get away, dog! Get away! I'm lucky I wasn't alone. I want to tell you something. but if we stay... at your lady's door people will start talking. What do you want to tell me? If we go around the corner. we can talk better. - Where? - Here. Come on. No. Let's go in so no one see us. - What if someone sees me? - Come on. - What do you want to tell me? - That you're pretty. You're such a fool. Your collar's up. No one takes care of me. Come here. Get in. Someone's coming. Did someone see us? You don't like me because my collar's not ironed. I'll get a straightener from the doctor. He won't know it's missing. Your fingers are so soft. They were filed from working with bricks so long. When I went to enroll, they couldn't find my prints. Really? They had to take it off the little finger. It works the least. God, you're strong. Don't crush me. To protect you from the dogs. You don't have to be frightened with me. If I wanted to, I could break you in two. You're new here. Why? Because you write many letters. Those of us who've lived here long, write less. I don’t understand. We got tired of writing and not receiving answers. After a while, hardly anyone answers. I’ve been lucky up to now. Have you been here long? Six years and while I can afford it, I'm not leaving. Where’s your family? In Buenos Aires. I even have grandchildren I don't know. "Dear Nené, I've been here over 2 weeks and I've only received one letter from home and now yours. What a beautiful letter you sent. Is all you say true? The people that don't write are very mean. Are they afraid of getting infected through the mail? What can I say? I might get worse here because of what I see If I let them take control over everything, I'm doomed. There's so many doctors that they don't remember who you are. There's lots of serious diseases and they treat you as if... you were to die tomorrow. That's why I'm smart and I don't pay attention to them. The river's warm during the afternoon. And instead of taking a nap I go swimming. Don't worry about the nurses. The youngest one went to school 50 years ago." - Thank you. - Can I sit at your table? Welcome. Come in. Sorry, but since you're an educated man, I wanted to ask you if you can correct my spelling. It's a pleasure. I see you're still getting letters. Not many. I've been let down. Was it a woman? Doesn't she write to you any more? Why talk about it? I wanted to ask you something? That pretty girl, the blond one, I don't see her around any more. She died. How come? She was fine 2 days ago. "Dear Nené, you might say I'm mean, but what I most liked about your letter is that your boss Scolded you for going so often to the bathroom to cry over me. Don't cry, silly. Do you really love me that much? I've made a promise today. I've decided to obey the doctors. A few days ago they scolded me. Since we're apart, there may as well be a motive. That way, when you see me in town again, we'll be sure I'm totally cured." There's no romance today. Are you feeling OK? I can call the doctor. Leave me alone. Alone? You should be dead. - You look good today. - Because I feel good. Why? Did you get a letter? Yes. You said that people forget about you. but there's someone who doesn't forget about me. I'm even happy I got sick. I love this girl. In this letter I'm still not telling her. But I’m going to ask her to marry me. What does she say? That she cries when she thinks about me. Because I'm sick. She's right to cry. Neither you nor I will get well again. That's not true! I feel a lot better. You can't believe in what a woman may say in these cases. She may say things because she feels sorry for you. And it's unfair to tie a healthy girl down. I'm going to take a walk. Can you correct this for me? Of course and forgive me. I don't want you to fool yourself. "Now I should have both hands free so I can touch your skin. My Life. I really love calling you My Life. I'd like to be inside you far from all this. But promise me one thing: don't hide in corners crying, Although I may have to stay here till the end of the year. It's expensive, but being healthy it worth it. Today I saw a place where I'd never like to be." Excuse me, where are the ones that have... Tuberculosis? Over there. And the ones that are worse are upstairs. - Looking for someone? - No, I was just walking by. You're a new doctor here. Yes. Have you been here long? Around a month. There's always new faces here. When one bed's free, someone quickly occupies it. There aren't enough of them. Do they leave? No. When a bed's free, it's because someone died. - The director wants to see you. - Will he scold me again? You deserve it, for a lot of reasons. - Wanted to see me, doctor? - Yes, Etchepare. Come in. - I'm behaving. - Yes, I've been told. Your last X-ray is very encouraging. But I've received a letter from your home. The deal they’re offering is impossible. This is a business with many expenses to keep up with. There are other hospitals in the area that are less expensive. That's why we'd like to ask you to leave as soon as you can. - We're very sorry. - At the end of the month? Fine. "My Dear, I may arrive before this letter does, but I still have to talk to you. Today was one of the worst days of my life. But just by writing to you, I feel better. What will it be like When I see you then? When I get home, we'll start a new life, together forever. Do you accept? Start making plans." The clothes are all stained. I'll wash them all tomorrow. With the fee they charged, the clothes could at least be clean. You look good. I gained 8 pounds. Two each month. But you have to go back. We'll fix everything here What's new in town? - The scandal Mabel's father caused - What happened? You cant imagine. He sold the English guy a sick cattle, and now he got sued. And he broke up with Mabel. They're not getting married. Please get the bath ready. You're staying with us tonight, right? No, I'm going out for a while. - So you're back. - Yes. I got here this afternoon. Nené, you've got company. Aren't you supposed to be in the hospital? Yes, but I'm better now. Are you completely cured, or not? You look great. The fun is over. You'll have to get back to work. He's cured. - But, Dad... - Will you start working? I don't know. I want to ask for some more days off. If you can't go back to work then you re not well. You have no right to talk to me that way. I certainly do, I'm her father. I won't continue talking to you in that tone. ï»¿1 - Don't listen to him. - You shut up. How dare you, come near my daughter if you're not healthy? You're crazy. What if she gets infected? I'll be right back, Dad. - It's for your own good. - Let me go. - Juan Carlos, wait. - Your Dad'll pay for this. Don't listen to him. What matters is that you're here - And that you're better. - Really? Finally. Would you have the courage of marrying a sick guy? Yes, of course. I don't care about anything. - But not that. Let me go. - Now. It has to be now. Let's go somewhere. No, let's behave a little longer so you can get well. Tell me you're not afraid of getting infected. I'm not. But will you still love me after? More than ever. When he finds out what happened with Asquero, he won't love... me any more. - Promise you won't leave me? - Why should I? You're going to think I'm a whore. Come with me, let's go. Why are you like that? Isn't hugging me enough? You're scared, that's what. Juan Carlos. - What are you doing here? - Call Mabel now. It's Pancho's. He's in the Capital studying to be a police officer. Tell me about it later. Call Mabel. She says she can't come out because she has a cold... and that she's leaving for Buenos Aires early tomorrow. She sends her regards. What's the matter? Tell her to come here! Tell her. - NenÃ©, you came! - Of course. He's so cute. He looks like him. Excuse my house. My aunt Went out. Sit down. Raba, are you going back to Mabel's house? No. I'm going to do Laundry here. And you? Is it true your boyfriend's a stranger? Yes. But he's not cute. - Is he a good guy? - Yes. Haven't you ever see him? Will he stay here? No. He doesn't like this town. He likes Buenos Aires. I'm sorry, Raba. I didn't get your baby anything... because I didn't know what he needed. You tell me. - He needs lots of things. - Doesn't he send you anything? No. Before leaving, he told me to wait for him. When he gets a steady job, then we'll get married. I promised him that no one would know the baby's his. - Sure he's being honest? - Yes, Pancho's a good guy. I love him a lot. I only want the baby to be healthy. So that when he returns, He'll be proud of him. It's late. It's 6:00 already. That watch is new, isn't it? Yes. I didn't want to tell you but he gave it to me. - We're engaged. - You're so lucky. Pancho's so far away. I'm dying to see him. But I really want him to see the baby. I wonder what he's doing. - Bye. - Bye. Etchepare, the supervisor wants to see you. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, Etchepare. - How are you? - Better, thank you. I have some bad news for you. You can't get any more days off. - But I'm not getting paid. - We can't do it. The doctor says you need a long leave, and that means you're disable to work. That's why I'm asking you to resign. Dad... -Bye. - Come on, dear. - Bye. - Congratulations. FEDERAL DISTRICT 525 KM. "Dear Mabel, when we were in sixth grade, we made each other a promise, and I'm fulfilling it. The first one to go on her honeymoon had to write... about her trip. Thanks for the wonderful gift It's a beautiful lamp. It's as if you're missing me. I love Buenos Aires. We'll be living at a hotel until we get a home. It's expensive but my husband... how weird saying "my husband"... has to impress the people he'll be working with. At first we always ate there, so at night we'd eat till we burst because it was a fixed rate. After we were too sleepy to go out. That's how men are on their honeymoon. But then I found out we could have only one meal there... and then eat out at an economic restaurant. So I casually take him near the Obelisk and he can't say no. That's where all the theatres are! We see something different every night. In a month, we'll have our own flat." - lt's Raba. - Who? Raba! Don't you remember me? - Are you with the baby? - No, he's with my aunt. She washes clothes and is taking care of Panchito. How is he now? He's little. I haven't seen him for a week. I want to know how old he is, Is he one year old yet? Yes. After being here a year I'll go see him. You don't understand me. Cover one ear with your Hand. Yes, OK. Hasn't Pancho promised you anything? He won't talk to me because he says I opened my mouth. He's waiting to get a steady job at the police department. Did you go to my house? No. But I ran into your parents. Why is your dad so thin? My poor dad has cancer. He's just skin and bones poor man. NenÃ©, your mother told me to ask you if you're going... to send her the money. She said that you bought new living room furniture, and that's why you're not sending her money. Did you see Juan Carlos? No, he went back to the sierras. They say he's going out again with the widow. Can't come over one day and tell you everything? Sure, but call me first. Sure. You're not going leave me out because of what happened? Because I'm not married and I already gave a son. Don't be silly Raba. But when you come over, I'm going to talk to you about that creep. Juan Carlos? No, the creep that made you have that baby. - I'll open your eyes. - He's not bad. - Call me soon. - OK. Bye, Raba. Thanks. - I'll get some hot water. - Who were you talking to? A maid from my town. If she calls back and you answer, tell her I'm not here. I don't want her to come over. She could keep you company. No, I don't want her to see the house without furniture. We can buy them in payments. No. They make you pay high interests. - It's Raba. - How are you? - Can I come over? - Not today, I have to go out. We talked the other day and you didn't mention where you worked. In a factory, but I don't like it. I want to go back to town. Come over some day so you can see my nice furniture. Can't come over now? I feel very down on Sundays. My husband's about to come home and then we're going to... the theater. If he sees you here, he'll think... I had a good time, and then we won't go out. Did you send your mother the money? I didn't want to tell you much but she told me everything. About what? She said you promised to send the money so your dad... could receive the treatment and the hospital. And they can't afford it. I can't now. I have to pay the living room furniture. My mother said they treated him well anyway. You wouldn't know, that's the big deal? Why doesn't she use the money from the savings account? That's what you save up for: emergencies. It's 3:00. I'm going to be alone all afternoon. If I were working at Mabel's house I'd be near Pancho. He's at the police station all day. Bye. - Hi. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - I didn't see you. While you re there, could you cut me some figs? Excuse me for being on the wall, but if the radio doesn't work, the prisoners complain. And you probably want to hear it too. Dark-skinned bum. He thinks that by bathing he'll look whiter. Do you want the ripe ones or the greener ones too? Look at my uniform and how my boots shine. No, just the ripe ones. I can get the darker ones down with a stick. I'll eat them one by one on the grass. I don't care if there's bugs. Call me. I'll jump on the wall. I jump, I climb. I'll get near her and touch her. What if you have work to do? Or do you just listen to the radio? He left Raba with a child. What did you spray on the plants? Poison. There's ants. Little black ones, big black guy. Could he have forced her with those rough hands? I'll get you these. Juan Carlos told me she was a bitch. Yes, those. They're just ripe to eat. Take some if you want. They're hard to peel. I'll peel you. Green skin, red and sweet pulp. I'm scared you might fall off. I'll throw them to you one by one. Here goes. - Did it burst? - Let me eat one. If Raba comes back, this black guy will jump the wall... to rape her again. Too bad my boyfriend's in Buenos Aires. He loves figs. The guy who was here in the summer? She'll run off if I'm too fast. Who else? A dwarf compared to this big black guy. He's somewhat short. I have to like him, not you. Would you like some more? OK, the ones on the top. Don't leave yet. I can't reach them. Where could her mother be? I'd have to jump in your back yard and climb in tree. - You want me to? - No, My mother would get angry. Some other time. But not if she's around to see you. My Mom wouldn't say anything. Is your mother always here? She's always here. She hardly ever goes out. Then when will I be able to jump down? At night. I Don't know. At night My mom's always here. Doesn't she take a nap? No, she doesn't. But she must sleep at night. But you can't see the figs at night. - Yes, you can. - But you can't see the ripe ones. Yes... because I touch them and the ripe ones are softer. I think I'm going to eat them all tonight. What time does your mother go to sleep? I got her! At 12 she's asleep already. I wonder if he raped Raba. If you want, I can come then. Are you going to place the antenna? There's time for that. First I'm going to eat a fig. They say this one's a blond She gives you luck. But you're not lucky. Your luck ran out. I'm broke. We'll give you another chance. Let's play again. You may be lucky this time. I don't have a penny left. I don't know how I'm going... to pay the rent. "Dearest honey, you must be surprised to get news from me. I miss you. You realize that as time goes by. I often think it'd be great to have yow here with me." - Hello. - It's Raba. Is that you? Yes. Thank you for the gift. Did you like the plant? I saw it when I got here. Too bad I didn't see you. I'm going back to town tomorrow morning. I'm getting my job back at Mabel's house. That's why I went to your house without calling first. The doorman wouldn't let me in at first. But I told him if he didn't, the plant would die. Don't tell anyone back home you saw my house. I swear I won't. I'm leaving on the train tomorrow morning. Do you have anything for my baby? If you bring me something, I won't tell about your house. I don't have time to buy anything. I'll wait for you at the station at 8:00. The only thing I have is a piece of material. - You can make a dress. - OK, thanks. But it would be better if you had something for the baby. - But for tomorrow... - Bye, NenÃ©. It's time for you to go. Don't be mean. I do what I want... - ... and they don't complain. - Because they can't talk. If they talk, it's worse. Because her father might come and will see she's not alone. I don't like it when you talk that way. Why? Are you scared? - Come here. - Let go. A while ago you wanted it. Go ahead yell. Call your daddy. Close the window when I leave. It's cold. See you tonight. I thought you were a cat. "Dearest honey, you'll be surprised I answered so fast. I got your letter with the bad news today. I couldn't believe it. Poor guy. We were good friends, though he was just a bum. He was so healthy and now he's dead. I feel much better today in spite of the bad news. I might be getting cured." The one signing, Officer Gorostiaga, through this act, constitutes the corresponding indictment regarding a death, and summons Mr. Antonio Saenz, awaited by his wife and daughter, They were surprised while sleeping by the screams... of the victim, who had been stabbed to death by... their maid, Antonia Ramirez. It was proven the man was dead. The accused woman lay in bed unconscious. Miss Saenz was sitting at her right. The following morning, the suspect woke up... and made the following statement. A few days ago, the victim had ordered her to leave... the patio door open so he could visit her. But she reacted with contempt. It began when the woman saw the officer enter her room. He pointed her with his gun and told her to submit to him. The woman resisted but she said she would give in... to his will in the patio. As she walked through the kitchen, she took the knife... which she later used to defend herself. But the officers paid no attention to her threats. When he took out his gun, he was stabbed. After that, the suspect's aunt was questioned, a laundry woman, Who stated that the victim was kind to the child. The suspect will be tried in the town of Mercedes, and will be taken there this afternoon. What do you want? - May I come in? - Yes, please. Your plants are nice, but your house is a mess. They're the only thing I'd miss If I were to leave town. This is Juan Carlos' sister? - It's cold, isn't it? - Yes, it's cold here. Come In. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. It's a warmer in here. She doesn't have a heater. Her face is wrinkled. She's 45, at least. It's nicer inside. You're still a dwarf, even if you wear a hat. As I let you know before, I have something to say. Please go ahead. First of all, promise you won't tell anyone. You're going to suffer if you can't tell your neighbour. I swear on what I most love. On who? If you swear on my brother I spit in your face. On my daughter. Fine. I got a letter from my brother saying you... were going to sell everything and buy a hotel in the sierras so he could live there. It's true. Why should I waste time here? My daughter's married, not single like you, and I'm leaving to go with my love. My mother's very upset with all this. But isn't it for the good or her son? But she suffers because she can't help him. She shouldn't be so overbearing. You can't say that. You don't understand. My family's used to wealth. Take that. How dare you insult me, you bitch? Yes, mothers are like that. My mother and I would like to ask you to do something. Go ahead. She'll threaten to tell my daughter. You have to do everything without leaving an address. Send your furniture to Buenos Aires first. But don't let anyone here know you're with my brother. It's a disgrace for us. There, I said it. Don't worry. No one will find out. You know how people are here. Look at what they say about Mabel, your friend. Take that, she's your friend. I don't believe it. A nice girl like Mabel... couldn't have anything to do with that black guy. You're the worst of all. But they say she contradicted herself in her statement. She was probably nervous. Back to us, do you promise to be discreet? I promise. Discreet? You're the one who get into traveller's cars. Bitch Mabel, how wonderful! What a darling. He's already walking! Look at this one. What a cutie. No, Mabel, they're not cute Luckily, they're boys. One right after the other. You didn't waste my time. I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I've been waiting for you for a long time. When's your wedding? In 12 days and I have so much to do. And I'm not getting a long dress nor a party. - Your house is nice. - You like it? Yes. When I'm back from my honeymoon, you have to see mine. - My apartment's small. - It must be wonderful. You probably forgot to bring your boyfriend's picture. What for? He's a deformed midget. But you're marrying him He must be very interesting. I'm dying to see him. Show me a picture! I'm sorry, but I have to do so many things, I can only stay for a little while. I wanted you to tell me all about the town. There's, nothing new. Not my stockings! Hitler won't send us any. Careful, Luis. Let's go to my room so we can talk. - Just for a while - Take care of your brother. It's over here. Sit down. How's Raba? Fine. Her next door neighbour's wife died. He's a farmer who has land and a few animals. Just a few, but it's something. He's an older man with three children. She used to clean for him and finally ended up with him. Celina? A mess. You can't get involved with travelers. She goes out with anyone. And what about Juan Carlos? Weren't you going to ask? He's always at the sierras. Now and then he visits his family. He's always chasing women. I don't understand how she's not afraid of getting infected. Some might not know. They always want more. What do you mean? - You should know. - What? - Come on NenÃ©. - What are you trying to say? Weren't you intimate with Juan Carlos? You're terrible, Mabel. You're making me blush. Nothing happened between us. Want some tea? No, it's late. But don't get nervous about it. You were trying to tell me something. That when women get intimate with Juan Carlos, they don't want to leave him. Because he's very handsome and charming. You don't understand. Women don't want to leave him... because of the things he does in bed. I don't agree. Once the light's out, it doesn't matter... If he's cute, or ugly. They're all the same You're crazy! There's no two alike. - What do you know? You wouldn't know about Juan Carlos, would you? You know what Juan Carlos is famous for? What? Mabel, you're really going to make me blush. That seems to be very important to make a woman happy. - My husband said its not true. - Maybe he lied. I'm just joking. They told me something else about Juan Carlos What? Sorry, but I swore I'd never tell anyone. That's not nice, Mabel. Now that you've started, go ahead Sorry, but when I make a promise I keep it. It's so late! I have to go. - You visit was so short. - He's just like your husband. - How cute. I'll be back soon. - Call me before your wedding. When I get back from my honeymoon I'll stay longer. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. "That seems to be very important to make a woman happy." "You know what Juan Carlos is famous for?" "I'm just joking. They told me something else." "I swore I'd never tell anyone." Father, It's been years since my last confession. Now I'm here because I'm going to receive the sacrament... of holy marriage. Father, I have to confess an awful sin. I told a big lie. I lied to the justice. I used to lived in a small town with my family, and at night a police officer used to come to my room. He was the father of my maid's son. She had already come back from Buenos Aires when I... had fallen into temptation with him. I knew it was possible she might see us. The maid heard footsteps one night and went out. She saw him jump the wall and heard my window close. She found out. The following night she stayed outside... freezing while she waited for him to come out. I called my parents. I was scared the maid would kill me too. Mom! Dad! But I saw Dad go out near her. She was next to the body. He had the knife stuck in him. She looked hynotised and wouldn't react. My mother asked me to get alcohol to make her smell it. There was a bottle of sleeping pills in the bathroom, And I took some with me. I put them in her mouth and made her swallow them. She fell asleep, Father. When the police asked me what had happened. I don't know how but I lied to them. I told them that he had wanted to rape her. And that she had defended herself with the knife. When she woke up I told her that if she told the truth, she'd be sentenced to life and would never see her son again. I explained it to her until she understood. She was not to say he had been in my room. He had jumped the wall to see her and rape her again. It wasn't worth getting even with me, she had to save herself To take care of her child. And I explained everything clearly. She looked at me without saying a word. Everything turned out well. She understood she had to lie to be set free. Say 10 Our Fathers and 10 Hail Marys, and 2 rosaries every night. I absolve you of your sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Yes, Father. I know I'm weak. They said that card brings good luck. And what about this one? That one's bad luck. Ans this one? That one must mean money. That's what I thought. - Call a doctor. - Make room. Close the door. I want to get some rest. Or do the dishes later. There's no hot water later and I'll take a lot longer. Don't make noise when you're finished or you'll wake me. I'll take a rest on the boys' bed. Too bad. My husband doesn't like wool socks. - Do they itch? - A little. I'll take them anyway. Let him get used to them. I'm lucky you're open on Saturdays. I'm lucky to have seen you. Everyone's lucky then. - What time do you close? - In a while. Virgin Mary, adored one, you who knows what losing a son means, please help me. Although my son wasn't a saint like yours, he was good, and I'm scared God won't accept him. That He took my son because He was angry with him. He was a light-headed man and I Hold no grudge against him. He's dead now and can't hurt anyone. I don't blame him. I knew he wasn't smart with business. Why did mortgage my house for him, a weak man? He had a cold and she made him stay at the door all night... with her selfish desire. That's why I ask you, my Lord, to never let me see her again. Because if I do, I won't be able to control myself. NELIDA MASSA - Who was it, honey? - The postman, Mom. What are you doing? Is it a letter? No. Just some ads. "Dear NenÃ©, I hope you're well. Your letter has been very comforting. I'm writing to you right away because I've always liked you. It was because of my daughter, Celina, that I didn't talk to you She's very upset about the loss and doesn't want to write to you That's why if you want to keep writing to me, Please do so to a post office box so she doesn't find out. Dear NenÃ©, please trust me. Tell me why you're so unhappy with your marriage. Let if off your chest, I may be able, to give you some advice. Dear NenÃ©. I was anxiously waiting your letter... because I need your husband's address to give it to... a lady who's traveling and wants to buy... a piece of land in Buenos Aires. Since I know your husband's in the realty business, I thought about it at once. DONATO JOSE MASSA, REALTOR "They look like their father and I feel I don't love them... because they're so ugly." "I swear I do my best to hide the disgust he causes me." Why did you take so long? I was plucking my eyebrows. I heard something that made me very happy. What? I heard that that stupid NenÃ© has problems with her husband. I wonder how she is? Does she know of Juan Carlos' death? I don't know. Mabel wrote. Oh well, she must be very busy. How many children does she have? - Two boys. - Then she'll never be alone. What do you want? - Did Mr. Etchepare live here? - Yes. - Do you have any spare rooms? - Yes. Don't I know you from somewhere? I don't know. Who are you? Mrs. Massa. And these are my children. NenÃ©. Don't you remember me? It can't be. You're Elsa Di Carlo. Yes. I'm the owner here. Come in. Are you staying long in Cosquin? I really don't know. We left our suitcases at the station. I have a room with two beds. I can add a bed and you can all be together. Did your husband come with you? Go outside, boys. I have to talk to the lady. You know that Juan Carlos died 6 months ago, don't you? Did he ever mention my name? Sometimes. Did he love you? - Don't ask me that. - You do know I loved him. - With all my heart. - You can't ask me that. I earn a living without anybody's help. You're a married woman who has everything. I'm not a married woman. My husband and I are separated. Why did you come here? Because Juan Carlos always wrote about Cosquin. I wanted someone to tell me things about him. He was very thin. But he was just like always. He always went to the bar. And in the end he brought me many problems. He gambled a lot. It was the only thing that entertained him. And I lost everything. I must look old. Many years went by. What happened with your husband? If you can tell me. Things just happen. It was 2 weeks ago. But he was the one that left. So I don't have anything to regret. - Was there another woman? - No. He realized there was nothing between us. Then he changed his mind and went to the train station. But I came anyway. If I stayed, I would've gone back with him. Would you like to see Juan Carlos' room? Yes. He mentioned you often, NenÃ©. That was his bed. - What did he saw about me? - That you were a nice girl. And that he wanted to marry you. Do you know if he wanted to see me at the end...as a friend? I used to get very angry when he talked about girls. He suffered a lot at the end. Poor guy. I used to get up at night and change his sheets... because they were sweated. But the worse part was with the laundry women. I needed so much linen to change him so often. There weren't enough sheets. Mr. Teodoro, wait a second. There's a cab outside. A bus leaves in half an hour. I wanted to stay. You better not, NenÃ©. I don't want to talk about the past. I want to forget everything. But I wanted you to tell me more. I'm very sad. And don't want to make you sad too. Boys, let's go. It's late. Mom, I want to go pee.. - Hang on, we'll get there soon - I can't You can go at the station when we get off. I'm bored, Mom. Look out the window. Look how pretty the sierras are. See? God created so many beautiful things. 12th APRIL 1973 In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. May I offer you something? A brandy? Yes, thank you. Poor Mom, she's suffering so much. - What does she have? - A tumor in her spinal cord. - Poor thing. - And she's not even 60 yet. Honey... - I want to ask you a favor. - Whatever you want. When we bought this house I gave the scrivener a paper... with my last will. It said that I wanted to be buried with some memories... I have of the children. A bib... and a little broken watch. And also, there are some letters. They're all kept in the top drawer of my closet. Please... tear those letters up. And burn them. Because they're things of the past... that are not important. Mammals are vertebrates, comma. Their bodies are covered with hair. Did you put eggs for your brother in there? Yes, Mom. But there's so many. You're crazy. You've always been jealous of your brother. Why are you complaining. You asked me to give you... your wedding party and I will. What do you want so much? I didn't give him any party. I don't want to go to Albarato Argentino. They have better towels at La Casa Palomero. Every time I go to Albarato Argentino, I remember NenÃ©. Who was she? You never knew her. She was a saleswoman. She went to Buenos Aires. "Today was one of the worst days of my life. But just by writing to you, I feel better. What will it be like when I see you then?" "I'm running out of paper, Doll. I love you like I've never loved anyone before. Kissing you until you say stop, Juan Carlos." My Life, I miss you. Before getting your letter, I felt odd. I was scared of really being sick. But every time I read your letter, I have faith again. We're going to be so happy."
