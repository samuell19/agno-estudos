Mr Chang. What's up? I would like to tell you I enjoyed your lecture very much. Thank you... This is my phone number. Every Thursday night, my parents would go out for a bridge game. If you have time, come over to teach me to read "The Golden Lotus." I'm a lecturer, I have my principles. Too bad! "The Golden Lotus" and principles don't mix. You can insult my soul. But you can't insult my body. She is still a student. How can she be such a slut? What? He's not coming home for dinner? Tell him to forget about getting a car loan from me. Ching and I will stop by Chinatown for some candies. Hey, we still have to go to Chinatown? I am meeting my girl downtown. If you ever have kids, teach them to respect the elderly. I'm in a rush, you know. She's been waiting for some time. Did you pay your respects at your mom's grave? I did, on eleventh of April. Eleventh of April? Isn't eleventh of April Easter Day? You thought your Mom was Jesus? When I was dating your aunt, I dreamt about her every night. Have you dreamt about your Miss Perfect yet? No. Do you know how to pick the perfect wife? How? I'll teach you a way that I learnt from my father-in-law. Okay, when we sit down for lunch in a minute... see if she addresses everyone before she eats. If she does, it proves her meticulousness. That means she can easily adapt to our Chinese customs... and know how to respect our daily life rituals. Understand? She's no good if she doesn't even say "Bon Appetite." Hey, your father-in-law's got a point. And that's how I fell into the trap. Hello? I'll pick you up. Where are you going? I will be back soon for dinner. - Oh gosh, my legs are numb! - Hurry up! Michael and I are working for the U.S. government. Teaching is just our cover. We grew up together. I witnessed Michael marry and witnessed him divorce. His whole life is ruined by gambling. This time, we're going to save a member of Yamagushi. His name is Yamamoto. He is very useful to the C.I.A. I've done a lot for the US government in these few years. But every time after getting the job done, I feel awkward. As if the feeling of glory is lacking. Maybe deep down, I am still a Chinese. Do you think there's any bonus for taking the Japanese out this time? Why don't you ask the chief? I hope so. I'm short of cash. To get laid? I have to pay to get laid? You must be kidding! Joe, get ready! I see their car coming! Your ex-girlfriend has a thing for me these days. Crazy Susan? She even gave me a ring. You mean she has money to buy you a ring? Sure, from the dough that you left her. How could she use my money to do such a thing? That's no big deal. Your money ends up with me anyway. You want her back? No, thanks! I had a hard time getting rid of her. Now that she has a thing for you, she's all yours. You can have her back. You jerk! - No one drives their car this close. - What the hell are you doing? - F**king asshole! - Remember to act like it! Back off! F**king Chinese! F**k you! - I will f**k you, you stupid son of a bitch! - Mike, take off your pants. He won't dare, you nutcase. - Hey, listen here, guys. - What did you do to our car? You totaled my car. I'm talking to you! Go away! Don't push me! Go and check. Shut up! Shut up! Joe, Japanese is in the second car. Hey, he's in there, there. Michael. Put down your weapons! I said put down your weapons! Move! Move! Drop your f**king guns. - Help! - Shut up! Try it, and he is history. Hey! I said back off! What? You want him dead? I don't care. One, two... Mr Yamamoto, it's okay... You are safe. We are from the U.S. Government. - U.S. Government? - Yes. You have six, I have six. We're even. All right, guys, we're all done here. So let's go. What happened to you, Uncle? He mumbled another woman's name when he was napping... so I woke him up with my fist. I see... Dad, Mom, Jeff, Josephine, enjoy your meal. Dad, Mom, Brother, Jeff, Josephine, enjoy your meal. Uncle and Aunt, enjoy your meal. Josephine eat rice. Okay, let's eat! - Sir, bye! - Bye! Take care! Bye! The aim of sending you to China... is to steal a national treasure back to the U.S. What? I am a Chinese! You're asking me to steal a national treasure out of China? Don't you remember making an oath to be loyal to U.S.? As soon as you arrive in China, a man called Tong Ling will meet you. He'll arrange everything for you. I heard that he is very cautious. And his background is complicated and confidential. According to our information... he helped many extremists escape from China. How about Michael? Michael? I'll arrange him to meet you in Taiwan when the time comes. Good luck! Yeah... - A new job was offered to me in China. - What did you say? A new job was offered to me in China. You don't even know how to speak Mandarin! I am your Mandarin tutor. Our first lesson is about social life. Do you have any questions? My telephone number. Call me please! Wow! You've been dreaming a lot! Courtship Today... our topic of discussion is... courtship. It hurts! Ouch... - Of course it hurts, you know why? - Why? Because your finger's bigger than a banana. Banana? I have to go. Bye! How come nobody can fit this ring? - Bye! - Bye! Welcome to China, Mr Chang. I'm Tong Ling. - Pleased to meet you. - Same here. Since the revolution... the standard of living has improved... with restaurants and entertainment spots everywhere. Some places are even better than the west. But if it is as good as you describe, why are so many people leaving? What did you say? Why are you laughing? Where did you learn such fluent Mandarin? I have a special tutor. But I also speak Cantonese. Whichever way you prefer. I hope our Chinese-American relationship works well. It would be the best! Like making sail in the favourable wind. You may talk to me in Cantonese. In Beijing, I have to curl my tongue in order to speak Mandarin. Maybe God is punishing my foul mouth. No thanks. You shouldn't be so superstitious. My car always breaks down. It needs repairing from time to time. It seems that I have worse luck than you. These rural people are very poor. They don't have good food like you have in the States. Don't push yourself if it doesn't suit your appetite. As a matter of fact, the Americans are flexible. You pay for what you get. You eat the whole corn while we eat popcorn. We eat buckets of popcorn at movies. Is there rice? - Please help yourself, eat more. - Thank you. Does it suit your appetite? When I had my training in Bangladesh, even though the food was awful, I just ate. The old lady wants you to have these two eggs. Thank you. Have you ever considered leaving China? I've thought of it everyday. Why don't you leave then? I stay to help those who really want to leave. It is more meaningful this way. The water still taste so fresh. Get out of the car! It's 140 bucks in total! Are you sure? The meter says a hundred. Yet you want me to pay $140? You're cheating me! You've got to pay for the luggage too! There's no point in arguing, pay according to the sign. The sign says a dollar per kilometre. And two bucks more per luggage. Four bucks for two pieces, and you dare say forty bucks? Each piece of luggage has travelled twenty kilometres. So two pieces would cost forty. There's no mistake, pay now! No sweat! I'll handle it myself! - What are you doing? - Come over here. I don't have Chinese currency. But I have a thousand dollar bill. And another fifty dollar bill. You pick one yourself. I'll take this one. What a nag! If not for the money, I would never take you to Shaolin Temple. I'll bet this for a hundred RMB. It's only worth 40 RMB. - What are you talking about? - What a fool! Go after him. A thousand yen can only be exchanged for forty RMB. I would never ever go inside Shaolin Temple. You're pretty smart. Hiding me at the Shaolin Temple so nobody would know. I am very careful indeed. The abbot here is my neighbour. Just inform him if you need to see me. Have a seat first. Someone has sneaked into the Assembly Hall. The door is opened, let's check inside. Come out...! How dare you sneak into the Assembly Hall? Come out! Don't go out. Who is it? Why is your heart beating so fast? How do you know? Your pulse tells me so. I've seen many women before. And this woman causes my heart to race. What's going on? Come out! Let's search! Don't worry, I won't betray you. Gentlemen, let's talk. I'm innocent. Don't let the other one get away! Let go of me! Don't come closer or you'll be sorry. Help! Well, your steps are quite good! Show me more. Come on! Be careful. You're right. I have the gun, so you have to be careful. Who was that? You little fat boy! - It hurts! - Hands up! You Shaolin monks like to attack from behind? You don't know the way to hell? How dare you! Attack from behind again? Weapons are prohibited in Shaolin Temple. I'll keep the gun for you for the time being. Who are you? Again? I'm sorry. He is Abbot Hung-Chi of Shaolin Temple. That girl has mental problems. Her sickness is healing fast. If she escapes, it would waste all our effort. Most of the people here speak Cantonese. Treat this place like your home. Help out with the chores if you are free. Never leave the temple at daytime. Never leave your room at night. Eat while you may. Pass motion while you can. - Mr Chang. - Yes? If you need to exchange foreign currency, please feel free to come to me. Because our rate is slightly higher as compared to outside. Yes. Master wants me to ask if you have any laundry? Are you still mad at me? Master said the world should be... filled with peace, harmony, respect and love. So if I am still mad at you, I'd be breaking the rule of forgiveness. Those are your master's teachings. - What about yourself? - I... Monks shouldn't lie. You should be angry at me. I would be if I were you. This is for you. A token of my apology. - You know what this is? - Game Boy! - Have you played it before? - Never. I saw it in the supplementary classes. What is this supplementary class? Basically, we studied history and geography. And also new products of the world. Master says we monks should also know about modern things. Such as? The most popular watch is Swatch. Karaoke is the most popular entertainment. There are four pop kings in Hong Kong. Dr Martin is better than Nike. I can tell from your clothes that you are not trendy at all. You are not wearing Calvin Klein. Not even a pair of 501. And no Giorgio Armani. How can you hang around town without the basic gear? - What do you mean? - To hit the town and stay cool! Uncle, is this Game Boy really for me? - Do you know how to play? - No problem. I'll study it. That's no problem. Be kind... Good night... - Thank you... - You're welcome... - Bye... - Bye. Good night. - What's your name? - Grasshopper. Why is she crying? Hey! I shouldn't be treating you so nicely. After what you did to me today. I had no bad intentions. It's fine! I know they haven't cooked anything for you. I've brought you two eggs. Come over and eat. I don't want to. You don't need to be so sad even if you don't eat. I'm not sad. If you're not sad, then why are you crying? I don't know. Maybe it is because of the snow. Are you kidding me? Do you have a radio here? You should listen to music in order to loosen up. I don't have music here. Maybe I can sing a song for you to relax. I will start singing now. You want me to sing you five songs? I can't recall that many. - How about three? - No. You are so greedy! I'll sing you one first! Here I go! Good and bad... - Are you all right? - I'm fine. I heard some noise coming from the backyard. I'll come visit you tomorrow night. - What's your name? - Jeffery. What? Fatty? Not Fatty, it's Jeff! Just call me Ching. Come in. Hi! You come from the States? Morning, masters! Would you tell me... Grasshopper. Have all the monks gone crazy this morning? Nobody will speak a word. What's the matter? Tell me. We have to meditate these two days. So nobody is allowed to speak. Don't tell anyone you saw me. I knew you would come. I have something to show you. The right hand side. I'll come in and talk. Hey, your room is locked. I can't open the door without the keys. How did you come out yesterday then? I stole the key while they delivered my meal yesterday. You've stayed here for a long time? Almost two months. Where did you live before? I don't know. Every time I wake up, the rooms have been changed. Wait a second. You don't even know where you live? I really don't know. They change my room constantly. I don't even know where I am. Do you want to see what I painted? How are you going to show me? You only need to place your hand against the door. Just concentrate and you will get it. Concentrate. Focus. What's your name? Hurry up! The abbot told me that you're healing fast. You should concentrate on your health instead. Don't waste other people's effort. Do you hear me? Ghost! Hey! Did you get it? Are you still outside? Kung-Chi... I want to find your Master. There is a ghost in Shaolin Temple! Why are you hushing me? Stop it! Stop this silly sound! It's so annoying! Okay! Be silent. I know... today is the silent day in Shaolin Temple. - However... - Quiet. You dare to stab me? I can sue you for murder. I have to see Tong Ling! I have to see Tong Ling! I have to see Tong Ling! Talking is prohibited during meditation day. I have to see Tong Ling... - Senior, are you okay? - I'm fine. He can't move for four hours. Let's eat. Why doesn't he show up tonight? My feet... A hot shower would be perfect to loosen up. Talk about perfect timing! Monks shouldn't be so cunning, but he caused too much trouble. Hey! What do you want? I should be asking you that! Why didn't you tell me there is no hot water? Luckily I have not used the soap yet! Where is my shampoo? It's right here. Thank you. What happened to your armpit? Nothing, just some abscess from a tumour. - That sounds bad. - Yeah. You'd better be careful... Master! Master, what happened to you? You vomited? Is that supernatural power? - Where are you going? - To the market. Oh! It's you again, the Canton man! So you speak Cantonese. So what? You'll have to pay double to ride in my cab. That's daylight robbery! I don't want to ride with you. I won't let you ride either! You think I don't have a car? What's the big deal? To the train station, thanks! - I'm not going! - Why? Because you are ugly! Boss. Are there any books on supernatural powers? Please take a look over there. You want this? Mom, I want this ball... No, be a good boy. Put the ball back. - I want this ball... - Why are you being so difficult? Let's go home. Or else I will beat you! - Boss, I need a prostitute. - You want a prostitute? Come in! Mr Chang, let me introduce you. This is Miss Blossom. Listen, you'd better serve Mr Chang well. - Of course! - This is for you. Thank you... Did you bring a calligraphy brush? You want to practise calligraphy? We are the police! Did someone ask for a prostitute? - Where is the man? - He left already. - He left? - What were you two doing? He paid me to do calligraphy. I'll never be a prostitute again. This is my happiest experience. This man has class. Hey, my bike! Stop it, it's a new bike! Stop right there! Why are you riding my bike? Let go! Stop! Let's go. I said start the car! I'll charge you three times more. It's you? Why don't you just rob a bank? Four times more. Shoot! It will be five times more if you keep bargaining. All right! - You idiot! - That will cost you a two dollar surcharge. My dearest sir, please start the car. That's more like it. Darn it! Look what I bought for you. Master told me to return this to you. Who beat you? The seniors. Why did they beat you? Master said monks shouldn't indulge in materialistic hobbies... and shouldn't have contact with these things. Grasshopper! I have to go. Let's go. - It hurts! - Be quick. - Grasshopper... - You can't follow him. What's the problem with playing this? Didn't you say Shaolin has to match the modern pace? We must follow our Master's teaching. Everything is Master's teaching. Have you got brains? This game is lifeless but your brain is alive. Playing it doesn't mean indulgence. Mr Chang, teaching Shaolin disciples is my responsibility. Please stay out of it. I've told you before that everyone in Shaolin Temple understands Cantonese. Why do you have to speak your mixed Cantonese Mandarin? Don't think that just by curling your tongue, it would be standard Beijing Mandarin. You should learn with a humble attitude. Go. Since my Mandarin is poor, your Mandarin must be perfect. Why don't you teach me then? I'm more than qualified, I welcome your challenge. But I'm busy tonight. - Good night. - F**k you! - Thank you. - I'm sorry. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - You're welcome. It's you! What's up? I've something to discuss with you. But you have to help me out first. Where did you steal the key from? I stole it when they delivered the rice. You should've told me earlier, I wasted my time stealing these. One, one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You look normal. You don't seem to have a mental disorder. Who told you I have a mental problem? Then why are you here? I don't know the answer either. I woke up and found myself here. The people from the research institute disappeared. The research institute? What kind of research? Supernatural power. You have supernatural power? I don't know. But I know I have a powerful energy source within me. But I need another body to reinforce it. Like the other morning you got the egg through the door. I don't understand what you're saying. You don't understand? Do you believe in the secret power of crystal? Sure, many scientists around the world... have experimented on crystal forces with success. Right, I'm similar to a crystal. I need a mediator to reinforce this power. You don't believe me? Give me your hand. Just concentrate and you can make your wishes come true. Really? You want money? Don't even think about it! Can you make my fist as big as a pot? Sure, just concentrate. - Are you sure? - Of course! - Let's start. - Just concentrate. What were you thinking of just now? I thought of my nursing maid just now. - You have to concentrate. - You too. Hey! It still doesn't work. You don't have to be that loud. Okay! I'm sure about it this time. Are you sure? Why am I hearing so clearly now? Stop laughing, would you? Wow! Bigger... Wow! It's really bigger than a pot! You're really something! Even Rocky can't beat me now. It's shrinking... It's spectacular! Hey! Wait. - Can you make this bloom? - Sure. - Really? - Yes. Let's start. Bloom. Bloom! I want to see a lot of flowers! Many many many flowers! Bloom... Oh no! Why isn't it working? Tell me, why isn't it working? It's really beautiful! A lot of people have praised me like that, but I usually don't admit it. You know, sometimes one has to be humble. But if you don't admit it, people will say you are a hypocrite. Cantonese would describe a man as handsome. They often say that. Do you think I am handsome? What do you mean? Am I handsome? Who is it? It's you, Grasshopper? Why did you dress yourself with flowers? Take a look at your hat! What? My hat? Who is it? Take her with you, I'll distract them. Go. My legs are numb. I'll carry you. Master... What is it? Master, I saw a walking flower pot. What? A walking flower pot? Are you crazy? I really saw it. We'll split into three teams, let's go! Grasshopper. Go after them! Don't run! Over there! We'll hide behind the bamboo sheet. The flower pot is over here! I think I heard Grasshopper's voice. They are in front. After them! Close your eyes quickly! You want to kill me? Hey! Why are you blocking my eyes? Hands off! I can't see at all. Do you still remember how you got the egg? This is our last chance. Quick, run...! Hey, what did you see? Mr Chang and Miss Mei flew up to the sky. Rubbish! How could a human fly? Oh no, Miss Mei! Come with me! How can a human fly? - Good night! - Wait! Are you coming tomorrow night? I'll let you know tomorrow. Come on! - What's the matter? - Nothing, let's go. I saw them flying together... What? - What did you see? - I thought I saw Chang Ching... You're never sure. It must be him! Let's get him! Come out! - Abbot, why are you short of breath? - You are short of breath too. I'm not the only one. I dreamt I was chased by a chicken! - A chicken? - Master... I lost him! The chicken is gone already. Let's go! Why are you so early this morning? I come out whenever I want to. Why do you have black circles under your eyes? I didn't sleep well last night. You must be thinking of me last night. I brought a friend to see you. Oh! It's you, Uncle! Why are you here? I've come to tell you that you're dreaming. Just tell her if you really like her. - I'm dreaming? - If you are not dreaming... then you must be out of your mind. Look at her. She is just like a floating cloud. If she is a cloud, then what am I? You are a bird. You should hang around the cloud. Does that make any sense? When you are in heat, a dirty mind is hard to beat. Tell her. Do I look like a bird? Oh, my dear little white cloud. Do you love this bird? Little white cloud! I love you! Please don't leave me! Hey! What are you doing? Are you crazy? I was just having a dream. Mr Tong, why are you so early? You've got dark eye circles? Didn't you sleep well last night? You're right. I was up thinking about you the entire night. Why were you thinking about me? There's something I need to tell you, but I don't know how. You'd better think twice before you say it. Do you know that the last time you left Shaolin Temple alone... you were followed by the secret police? Do you know that this action of yours could get us all killed? I remember when I was a kid, my family was really broke. Once I queued up for rice. And I saw a man who jumped the queue. He was then beaten to death by others. From then on, I knew the result if I don't follow the masses. I'd end up like that man. You Americans are so lucky. You don't need to queue up for rice. But bear in mind you're in China now... so you have to follow the rules like the rest of us. Mr Chang, master wants to see you. Grasshopper. Was anyone else in the backyard with you last night? Still that tough, huh? Spank him again! Tell the truth. Or else five more spanks. Again! Get back up there, quick! Master, I'm done. I'll ask you again. Was there anybody else besides you? I... - Tell us the truth. - Master, it's very painful... Tell me or there will be more pain. Come on. Spank again! Stop! Mr Chang, it's none of your business. Don't admit it! He just snuck into the backyard, it's no big deal. He didn't kill anyone or commit arson. Do you have to spank him like that? He's only a kid. He doesn't want to betray his friend. If he betrays me today, he'll betray Shaolin Temple tomorrow. Is that so difficult to comprehend? How can you teach your disciples from now on? You say you are moving along with the modern world. The words are beautiful but you never open the cage. You won't even give the kid the freedom to visit the backyard! How can you revamp Shaolin Temple in this way? Don't torture him anymore. I will take the rest of the spanking on his behalf. Come on... I said go ahead! Don't spank him... We are even from now on! Don't torture this kid anymore. - My bottom is painful! - Don't say anything. - Wu-Yen. - Master. Why are you here? I thought it was your shift to cook? Mr Chang said he's been here for too long. He said he wants to cook us a meal. He will arrange all the vegetarian dishes for us. What's that? It's vegetarian food. Have you tried it before? No. Mr Chang, before you go, I have something to tell you. What is it? The things you said this morning, I think you have a point. But that doesn't mean I am wrong. There's a Buddhist saying... "Right is wrong, wrong is right." Mr Chang, do you understand? No, I don't. - That means whatever you say is wrong. - What? You are leaving without settling Tong Ling's matter? We Chinese don't work like you Americans. We follow through from the beginning to the end. I am not asking you to stay. But if you decide to stay, it's your own decision. What are you doing? Why did you kiss me? This is our American way of showing affection. You're not a woman, what's the big deal? That's even worse, two men kissing and hugging! - Master! - What? Speak up! Master, didn't you tell us to take Mr Chang's luggage back to his room? I've told you already! What do you have to embarrass me? Namo Amitabhaya! Mr Chang! This is Japanese food, vegetable tempura! And this is sushi, and French fries! Cheers! He didn't leave? He told you to read this if you are bored. Let's admire the moon tonight. The most important thing in playing baseball is position. - Do you understand? - Yes! Show me the position. Here's your lunch, Miss Mei. Don't let Master know about this. Leave now. Listen carefully, I'll teach you once more. - Understand? - Yes. - Show me. - What? I'll teach you once more. Okay. - Understand? - What? Making fun of me? Oh no! Killing three monks with one ball. I'm not sick, I'm just exhausted. You read books until dawn, that's why you're exhausted. Have you read this book before? The Bund No, these books are only suitable for kids. Read it. It's very touching! Take this medicine! Mr Chang, hurry up! It's bad if Master knows about this. I'm leaving now. Swallow it. Give me back the cap. Good girl. It's touching? Some pages are missing. Miss Mei. It's my turn today. Use my energy to save face for me. One, one, one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Take your time, you will be better than me. Tuck in... Tuck in, Ching. - What did you say? You said "tuck in?" - Yes. Dad and Mom, she said "tuck in!" I'm so thrilled! We are leaving so soon? In three days? Yes. You don't want to leave? Why do you say that? I'm used to it here, I'll miss it. What will you miss the most? My first love experience is like that of Ching-Ching. We're both in love with a man who is afraid to show his affection. These pages in the book... are about how Ching-Ching feels about Man-keung. She was hoping that Man-keung could stay by her side... and provide her with a cosy family. I have the same expectation of Ching. That's why I am keeping these few pages from the book. I hope that Ching will be able to see them and learn what I am hoping for. I'll finish the book soon. I wonder if Ching-ching and Man-keung will have a happy ending. Master, it's you. Do you know that Mr Chang is leaving? I know he'll leave sooner or later. He's only a passer-by in China. Don't blind yourself with short-term happiness. Painful memories often come after happiness. I don't want him to leave Shaolin Temple... and leave behind some bad memories for you. Miss Mei. He belongs to the outside world. You won't fit in. When you realise the two of you aren't meant to be, it would be too late. Moreover, he's been with many women. He won't stay behind for you. - Who is it? - It's me, open up. We need to talk. We can talk like this. I'm leaving in two days. You don't have friends here. Why don't you come to the States with me? You want me to go to the States with you? If I ask you to stay in China, would you do that for me? Namo Amitabhaya. Just shut up, I'll give you four times more. Just drive. What do you want? I don't like to take orders. So how much do you want? I am a fair person. You cheated me once, I got you back once. So we are even now. I'll charge according to the meter. You look deprived. Let me take you to a brothel. Beijing chicks are white and chubby. Mongolian chicks have big chests. If you don't like hens, I can get you a cockerel. Shut up! I can even get you a female dog! Wait! Stop the car! You want a donkey? Hey! I'm just kidding. Are you serious about this? That donkey is diseased. Wait for me. You are really going for it? Make sure you have double protection! Who the hell are you? Hell? You are going to hell indeed. He just called, I think he has arrived. - Notify Captain Chiu. - Okay. Arrange for more men. Captain Chiu, Mr Wong has arrived. He is waiting for you downstairs. - Let's go then. - Okay. Chiu Chong Wen Mr Wong, my room is over there. Mr Wong, please come in. After you. This is the customs document for the treasure. When she arrives in Taiwan, we'll pay you the other half of the money. No problem. But I want another USD ten million. - What? - USD ten million. I thought we had a deal. The way I see it, I have to kill Chang Ching in Taiwan... without causing any suspicion to the U.S. government. And I've to return the national treasure to you guys... so that you guys can sell her to another country. All I got is just over ten million. This doesn't seem to be fair. You know that I can't return to the U.S. after this. It's better to have more money just in case. What if I say no? Bear in mind that we are all in this together. If you back out now, and the plan is exposed, you'd be in trouble too. Fine. Ten million is nothing. No, thanks. It's more important to have a friend. There are more chances in the future. - Clear up the mess. - Yes. I'll go find a bag. - Seal off all the exits. Follow me. - Yes. What's happening? Back off! Nobody is allowed in! I shot him. - Who? - Chang... Give way. Nobody went through any exits. He must be upstairs. - Where to? - Shaolin Temple. You are in a pool of blood. This taxi is rented. Don't dirty it. Shut up and drive! Drive? Listen, you'd better not die in my cab. You can die outside. Take a look yourself. What's the big deal? You stole a stack of blank papers? I told you to get laid! - The middle pages, you idiot! - Can't we do this later? Somebody help! Stop right there. What are you doing here? He's injured and I'm helping him. That's none of your business. Get out! Do you think I want to be here? He's injured. It's bad luck to meet you. Leave Shaolin Temple now and drive your stupid taxi. How dare you talk to me like that! Please stop arguing. I'm going to bleed to death soon. He's way out of line. No matter what, I am his senior. But you failed to give up the six carnal desires. And you indulge in gambling. - You don't qualify to be my senior. - I don't qualify? When I won, you also got a share. You didn't say I'm not qualified then! Anyway, master has forbidden your entry into Shaolin Temple. Fine, let's go. Don't leave... He asked you to leave, not me. We escaped death together just now, so how can I leave you now? Don't be so nice to me. - Just leave me here. - No way! You'd better put him down so I can move him inside. Then I'll teach you a lesson. You stupid bald monk! You called me stupid bald monk? You are a long-haired bandit! You bit me! - Again! - Sure, be my guest! - I'm in trouble! - Great! I'll get you this time! Give me a stick! Block him... Kung-chi, stay right here! - Master, catch it... - Okay. - Master, here's your stick! - Hurry up! How dare you chicken out? Oh no! It's a dead end! You stupid bald monk! Let's fight up here. Whoever falls down is the loser. You'll be the loser! I'm not scared of you! Go to hell! - Good! - Shut up! Kung Ching, you are shameless! You've betrayed your master and injured the Abbot today. I betrayed my master? It's better than you betraying your country for money! What are you talking about? You teamed up with Tong Ling in crime. I have the evidence with me. You're hiding the national treasure in Shaolin Temple. You... Senior Master. How could you do such a disgraceful thing? It was against my will. I was blackmailed by Tong Ling. You know how cunning he is. And now you've disclosed everything! Our Master has been kidnapped by Tong Ling. - Where is Mr Chang? - He's in my room. Why is he in your room? He is sick. Senior Master gave him some medicine and he is resting now. What? What did you say? - He is sick. - Sick? I come to visit him and he's sick. I suspect he has been to the Police Headquarters. If I could match his fingerprint on the weapon, then you'd be done for! You two come with me. - You bring some people to Mei's room. - Yes. Master, is he going to touch him? It's hard to say. - Master, is he going to blow... - Blow what? How could there be no wounds? His fingerprint doesn't match the one on the weapon. I know you saved him with your powers. If you didn't do it, how could he possibly be perfectly fine? The fingerprints had proven the murderer's identity. It's Chang Ching. With this evidence, it is easy to indict him of murder. Even if I let him go... the Americans would not let him off. But I need the truth from you. Because I don't care if anyone else lies to me. But if you lie to me, I'll be really upset. You know how well I treated you at the research institute. Because I really like you a lot. If you promise you won't hurt Ching, I'll do whatever you say. I was shot twice, how could I have recovered so quickly? When you were unconscious... Miss Mei asked me to use her power to save you. You should go and see her now. Thanks. If the old master is in any danger due to this incident... please forgive me. Mei? I've gone to the bookshop. And I've finished the whole book. Ching-ching and Hui Man-keung couldn't be together in the end. But I know we won't be like them. I'll take you with me. You'll be safe in the States. You are leaving with me tonight. I was happy that we spent nights under the moon. I'll miss that. When we arrive in America, we can spend every night under the moon. You'll be as happy as ever. He's okay. He's absolutely fine. - Why are you so worried? - Master has a heart problem. You have to take him to the hospital immediately. Are you out of your mind? The plan will fail if I send him to the hospital. Then all my efforts would be in vain. You should be ashamed of yourself. Master has treated us very well since we were young. How can you treat him like this? Calm down. I will let you go soon. When I have my share of the money, everything will be back to normal. You disguised yourself as me to sell the national treasure. How can you live up to our country and our people? Yes, I'm a hundred percent bad guy. I imitated you well, didn't I? Even my sister-in-law couldn't tell the difference in bed. You scared me to death. When I finish my job, you can be the police captain again, okay? This is fun! Keep an eye on my treasure! You must forgive your brother. A man's life is short. Just like the sound of a bell, it will disappear in a glimpse. The sound of a bell... Master! Please take care. You are a big boy now, don't cry. - Take care. - You too. Master. You don't need to look for Miss Mei. - Why not? - I've already sent her away. You sent her away? Where did you send her to? To Mr Tong's place. They had an agreement. If Mr Tong agreed not to hurt you, she would let Tong sell her to anyone. Don't be foolish! Miss Mei did it for your sake! If I leave her in the lurch, how can I call myself a man? Wait a second! What do you want now? Go now. Thank you. I hope you two can live happily ever after. - Where are you going? - See you tomorrow! Let's drink! Let's drink, come on! Cheers... What are you doing? Stop it! They are so irritating! Go out and have a look. I told you to go and check! Is everything okay? Be careful, keep your eye on it! I think we can double cross the American. That will do it. Shut up! Did you hear something? - No, nothing! - What sound? - The sound of wind chimes! - Nothing at all. Are you sure? Nothing at all... Fine. Bottom's up! Chang Ching! Look out! Use the back door. Open it. - What are we going to do? - Cover me and let's go. Yes... I'll get you! Cover me... Don't stop, charge! Charge! Don't give up... Let go of me! Don't move! How did you get out, brother? You never thought of that? It's time for you to surrender. Don't push me! Or I'll take her down with me! Let her go! Let her go? Look what's behind you first! I know there's a gun behind me. But if I can save Mei, I don't care about my life. Don't come near! I'll kill her! I've decided not to go back to the States. I'll stay in China with you. You're crazy! Why would you stay here when you can go back to the States? I should have told you this earlier. I don't know what you're talking about. I need a car to escape. Be quick! - Let her go! - You want to die? - I don't care. - Don't move! Do you feel like crying? Hey you! - Ching! - You guys protect her. - The rest follow me. - Yes! Ching... What is that sound? What is happening? What is that sound? Wind chimes? It's not my fault... Namo Amitabhaya... Die! This is Captain Chiu, this is Captain Kam. Nice to meet you. Can you see? If you have any messages, let me go and tell them. What else can I say? This is the worst for me. I shouldn't have betrayed the country because of Master. I know I should go to jail. I'm afraid no one will lead Shaolin while I'm away. You are my senior. Go back and be a leader if you have the time. No. When Master was alive, he didn't allow me to go back to Shaolin. Maybe when the disciples are out, I'll give them a ride for free. You have to keep your promise. Thank you. Don't worry. I don't think I'll have a chance to say farewell. Anything I can help you with? I would like to go out for a while. Captain Chiu. One minute. Thank you! Do you remember the ending of the book? I don't believe that would happen to us. I'm not sure whether I will be allowed to stay in China. And I don't know when I will be able to see you again. But I know whenever I look at the moon, I will remember you. I have something for you. Can we do this one more time? I'm waiting! I'm waiting... I returned to the research institute for almost two years. During this period, my power slowly disappeared without any reason. This spring, the staff of the research institute informed me that... they don't need me anymore. I can finally try to taste the life of a normal person. Although I have my freedom now, but I am not as happy as before. Maybe it's because Ching is not with me. I tried to locate Ching through many different people. But to no avail. But I believe that he'll come back for me. Maybe one day, I will meet him again at the train station. Can you fly with me one more time?
