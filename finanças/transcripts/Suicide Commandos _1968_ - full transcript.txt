unfit for the military exactly only the doctors made a mistake as of right now your private harper in the special services of the british army ah bully sergeant yes sergeant yes sir sir yes uh okay without a fence i sometimes think you imported french or fella headed off the boy scout troop commanded by harper when he was a civilian won every orientation contest that every regional and national boy scout meet for the past 10 years harper's a kind of a genius at direction finding at night in the daytime in fog and thunderstorms without any compasses or maps harper's boys have always found the right road before anyone else colonel we've had harper under observation for six months he's not a man he's a a walking compass a human radar he'll be the one when the time comes we'll be able to under under any conditions to lead us straight to our objective and maybe get us back home too yeah but you have the necessary equipment compasses sure section d equipment complete with compasses projectors and all the rest we can draw that stuff from supply but when the time comes even if we manage to get to our objective with our bare hands that's already saying a hell of a lot and there's just one we can use a man like harper i see a point sign but harper is so he's so fragile let's try giving him a rifle and a little self-confidence then let's see if he can use them very good now let's try hitting the target how do you mean target the black thing there with a little apron i did aim for it sergeant claire remember our agreement never in front of me yes sir may i try so with

fulfillment and ultimate success of the mission for which you have been trained sergeant ledeck will give you all the details later we've been training for several months for this moment and i have absolute confidence that all of you will do a first-class job when you board the aircraft you'll meet a corporal tule he's a demolition expert and he's as hot as hell so don't let him muck about with

the raf is ready to smash the division as it crosses the whoppertall plains here gentlemen is where we come into the picture from the air base at zumerhoff the germans can put 24 mississippi 109ks immediately into the air in just six minutes day or night and up until now not one of our bombers has been able to get through not once all bombing attempts have been complete failures on planes having a chance the german flag puts up a solid wall for our low-flying planes and our high-flying planes are bombers they haven't got a chance against those 109ks that panzer division has got to be stopped before it can take cover from our bombers in a little while we'll be over our objective in case you haven't figured it out we're going to blow up zoomer off air base we've been trained for this job so there's no reason why we shouldn't complete it harper you with us with some luck our planes will drop a battalion of red berets on the viaduct surrounding the sumerhoff base once they blow its sky high dakota transports will land on what's left of the strip from there they'll pick up the red berets and us too any questions yes how about our escape i just told you i only meant the mission might fail in which case no dakota's going to haul us out now i'll ask you a question if the mission fails who the hell is going to be left to get back it won't work it runs like the man does
