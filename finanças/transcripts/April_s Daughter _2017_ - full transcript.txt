Eat something. - Thanks. Who were you talking with? My Dad. I had a smoke outside. - How is he? - Fine, he asked about you. - Tell him I say hi. - I did. I'm going for a walk. - Want me to go with you? - No, I won't be long. I'm seeing you later, right? Yes. - About one o'clock. - Okay. Okay. - Thanks. - You're welcome. My love! Sam, can I have a drag? - No way, are you crazy? - One! You're pregnant. It's Mom. - Answer the phone. - You answer it. What? Are you going to call her? Yes. Hello? Hi, Mom. Al home with some friends. It's fine, don't worry about it. Let me see if she's here. No, she's not here. I'll tell her to phone you. Big kiss. Me, too. Bye. - You haven't told her, right? - No. - You're not going to? - Not until after it's born. But we need money, mine is running out. How much was the ultrasound? Tell me so I can write it down. Mateo is getting more work. Another ultrasound is coming up and doctor appointments. - Valeria, can Michel sleep over? - Yes. But not in the room upstairs. Don't tell her, I mean it. APRIL'S DAUGHTERS Mom! You knew? Clara phoned me. Are you angry? No. How are you feeling? Fine. I didn't want an abortion. I haven't said a word. What's the fathers name? Mateo. He's working with Clara, he wants the baby. Mom? I'll be right out, sweetie! - Sweetie! - Mom! Let me have a look at you. You're beautiful. - How are you? - Fine. - How was your flight? - I can't stand the air conditioning. - And this heat, right? - Yeah. You look good! Yeah. Let's see. Don't start going on about me being fat. No, I've never said that. Sloppy... And Valeria, how does she look to you? Tell me about her boyfriend. He's a good guy. His father owns a hotel downtown. He helps me in the shop in the afternoons. That's it. - Does he love her? - Yeah, a lot. - How old is he? - 17. 17? - And how are you? - Fine. - Are you seeing anyone? - No. No? Tell me the truth. I was, but not anymore. I want to create a website and teach Yoga online. But I'm not sure whether to make it subscription based, or find sponsors and offer free courses. I want to show you some photos. In which formal? In a high quality hard drive. A photographer recently took them. Can you help me record the videos? Sure. Videos are the most important part. You need to offer different routines so people don't get bored. Us three can do it. Valeria can learn quickly and be in the videos. We should make a sexual education website for her, instead: "How not to get pregnant on your first try." Clara! Come on! - Have you ever tried this? - No. You're silly. I don't know how safe it is at this stage. How far along are you? 7 months. After you give birth, it could do you a lot of good. Let's cook dinner? Yeah. - Where's Clara? - She went to sleep. How did you get into it? I had a friend who taught yoga. She asked me to help her organize groups and practice space, I stated giving class on Saturdays and that's it. - Are you doing any exercise? - I walk a lot. - Did you talk with Mateds parents? - No. Why? I don't know why Clara phoned you. Aren't you happy I came? Yes. How long are you staying? If you need me to stay, I'll help you. Whatever you want, honey. I should have phoned you earlier, I was afraid. - When did you stop going to school? - Two months ago. Are you going back? Not to that school. I'm going to look for another. Do you know if my dad is still with the same woman? Yes. How old are the girls? 5 and 7. How about her? 35. He's like 35 years older than her. 37. Valeria... Sorry! Come on. Get it out... It's good for the baby. That's it. Like this... Out! Very good. That's it. What do you eat for breakfast? Like, ham and eggs... There's an accumulation offal in the abdominal area.
