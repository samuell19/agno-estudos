Action. Okay, great. Now maybe above your head? Yeah, perfect. Great. Okay, all right. Are we done yet? Can I get back to work now? Just a couple more. Maybe one where you don't look so... Constipated? Nauseated? Try smiling with your eyes. Yeah, Zach, smile with your eyes. Make 'em twinkle. Okay, that's enough. I think I'm done. Come on, Zach, it's Christmas, it's for charity. You love helping kids. All the other guys did it. You're going to be on the cover. I don't want to be on the cover. Let Rey be on the cover. Really? How many calendars you think Rey's going to sell? It's a good point. Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Come on, move it! If you want to go over the pictures, or grab a coffee sometime - or anything, call me. - Great, thanks. Seriously? Hei, what's with you and the women? It's the uniform. I'm wearing the same one. Yeah, but you're married. Come on, man. They don't know that. That's true. Feline dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are both common in many species. Your pussycat patient may present with... Miss White? Can you tell us some of the symptoms a cat with cardiomyopathy might present with? Marilee! Marilee! - Wake up, Marilee! - Miss White? Feline heart disease. Can you tell us some of the symptoms... Low-pitched cough, breathing difficulties, noticeable weight loss or gain, reduced mobility, swelling in the abdomen. Thank you, I... Heart disease typically causes the heart to enlarge, and this enlargement causes the loss of efficiency... Very good, miss White. You may go back to sleep. You need some balance in your life. I mean, you're clearly exhausted. All you do is work and study. You need to relax, have some fun. It's Christmas. Go get a Mani/Pedi, watch television, go to a movie. I haven't been to a movie in years. Exactly my point. I just joined this dating site called "Just Dessert". You should sign up. I don't have time to date. After I graduate, I'll figure out... ...you fill out a questionnaire, they put a group of potential soulmates together, and you meet at a catered party for dessert. I mean, even if you don't make a love connection, at least you get cake. Have you met anyone yet? No... and I've gained, like, six pounds. I'm 79 years old and I'm going to die fat, old and alone. Please, you are not fat, and you need to stop counting your age in dog years. I'll see you Monday? Yeah. Bye. Al right... Okay. Okay. Increased thirst, frequent urination, vomiting. Poor coat appearance, depression, shock, trauma. That's it. That's exactly how I feel today. You are going to be a very good doctor. Lucy, I'm sorry, but you may have feline kidney failure. Or too many margaritas last night? First holiday party of the year. She's back. Marilee, could you please work some of your magic on Mrs. Smith? Sure, I'll take care of her. - Mrs. Smith! - Oh, Marilee! Hello, Bootsey. Bootsey has been a little anxious lately. He wakes up in the night worried about our visit to my daughter's house. My daughter has a very judgmental cocker spaniel. Well, the holidays can be hard on all of us. You've come to the right place. Huh, Bootsey? Maybe a new outfit would help Bootsey feel more comfortable, huh? We are having a Christmas Special on canine leisure wear. Hey! Hey, come on, leave the cat alone. Hey... Leave the cat alone! Come on! Hi. Come here. Okay... You're okay. You're safer now, all right? Just run home before it comes back. There you go. Hi. How did you get in here? Ambrose? What kind of name is "Ambrose"? I work 24-hour shifts, then I come home and crash. I don't do commitment. All right. All right. There's the door. I'm serious. I'm serious, you have to go. What are you doing? I live alone. I don't even own a plant because they require too much care. I said, you have to go. Really? One night, but that is it. I'll feed you, but that's it. I've had a long day, so stay in here and don't bug me. Fine, you can come in here, but stay off my chair. It's the one place I absolutely insist... All right, move over. One night, that's it, then you're gone. - Mrs. Winnamucker. - Hello, miss White. You scared me. Vilma Tuttle thought she heard a cat this morning. - Have you heard anything? - No. No, but we're surrounded by other apartments, so maybe one of them have... She distinctly heard it as though it was coming from this building. Well... I'll keep my eyes open. I can't imagine anybody would want to break the Angel Arms' sacred no pet policy. It would mean immediate eviction. Of course it would. Okay. Yes. Hi, Queenie! How are you? How was your day? Wow, that good, huh? Oh... Well, my day was pretty ordinary. I fell asleep in school, I almost got hit by a fire truck, and then I went to work and got slobbered on by a bulldog. All in all, a pretty good start to the holiday. - I'm going to get going. - Yeah. - I left them right here. - I'll check your equipment. - Have you seen my keys? - No, sorry. Hi, yeah, this is Zachary Stone calling again. I left you a message last night. I found your cat, Ambrose. And this number was on his collar. - Nothing in here. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Yeah, thank you. - Hey, what's up? Well, I found this cat yesterday, and he followed me into my house. Turns out his owner's this elderly woman who died last week, and she doesn't have any family. Do you know anyone who wants a cat? Not me, I'm a dog guy. I don't understand cats. It's probably because you've never had one. Hey, check this out, there's this dog on youtube. He got separated from his owner and walked over a thousand miles, using only scent to find him. A thousand miles? How bad did the guy smell? All right, maybe I got the actual distance wrong, but that's not the point. The point is, dogs are loyal, I get that. Cats, they're mysterious. Not once you get to know them. Actually, cats are very intuitive. They feel earthquakes before they happen, they smell smoke long before the fire alarm. They save lives. Great. You want to take him? Harriet's allergic. Hey, how does the gorgeous dental hygienist feel about cats? Melinda? I'm not seeing her anymore. Yeah, he's dating Blair now. She's a model. Of course she is. You know, it's like this magical revolving door of beautiful women. And seriously, I don't know what they see in you. Women like the challenge. He tells them he's not interested in a commitment, and they think they're the one that's going to change him. Zach, she's a model. Come on, would it really be that hard waking up next to her every morning? She does not want to get married, and neither do I. One of these days, you're gonna meet the right girl, - settle down, get married. - It'll never happen. You don't believe in happily ever after? I believe in happy right now. Ever after never works. Keep the model, don't keep the model, but the cat stays. No. Off the bed. I'm serious. Sorry, man, I've got to draw the line somewhere. - No? No good? - Not-not good. I'm new at this. What kind of cat do you have? Well, he's sort of orange-ish with stripes. That's a very rare breed. You should take extra special care of him. He's not mine. It's a temporary thing. I rescued him from this dog, and he sort of attached himself to me, and... His name is Ambrose. Cats have very good intuition about people. You should take it as a compliment he wants to live with you. Well, he doesn't really have much of a choice. His owner died, so he's stuck with me until I find him a new home. I volunteer at the shelter, and cats rarely make it out of there, so... You're a hero. I mean, obviously, you're a hero, You're a double hero. The cheap dry food can be hard on their kidneys, and if you have a male cat, they have a tendency towards prostate problems. I'd go with this dry food, and alternate it with the canned. Well, I gave him milk, and he wouldn't drink it. Yeah, no, milk's not good for them. They can't process the sugars in it. It gives them horrible diarrhea. Are you a vet or something? Almost. I have another year of school left. Right now, I work at Bosley's pet supply. - Oh, I know the family who owns it. - Eggshell, right? You're painting? Oh! I only ask because I just finished my living room. I painted it pearl. I couldn't decide between eggshell, ecru, or butter cream. It's stupid, sorry. No, no, not at all. I have six shades of white on my wall, and I can't decide which one to use. Is your house more traditional or modern? Definitely more traditional. I'd go with more... Creamier, yellowish tones, those whites, they're warmer. Like your eyes... For... instance. You having a party? No. Why? Just... Right. That... is going to last me a really long time. Good luck with the cat. Pathetic. Hey. You're the guy! You're the guy who saved my life! I'm gonna have to come around here and give you a bear hug. That's... Yeah, that's not necessary. This guy, this guy climbed through my kitchen window and saved my life when my oven exploded. Just doing my job, ma'am. Well, I'm glad you're safe. That's what counts. Forget it. I don't have time to date, and even if I did, guys like Mr. Brown Eyes don't date girls that talk about cat diarrhea. What was I thinking? - Thank you. - No problem. Yeah. - Well, I just... - Yeah. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! I'm so ridiculous... See? I'm watching T.V. I do have balance in my life. ...She has a mate, a companion... Hey... You're missing the best part. These are your ancestors, Queenie. Are you looking for a new house? Christmas is a great time to buy. Hey, Jaclyn! I'm watching you on T.V. Take my hand and I'll walk you through it... Yeah... Jackie, just a sec. I thought you were my landlord. Hi. You forgot about your birthday dinner. I didn't forget, you're early, right? I'm always early. I have to show a house on the way to dinner, and Kyle is double parked, - so let's go. - Oh wait. You stay here and watch the house, I'll be right back. I'll grab my jacket. I wish I could take you home with me, but my four dogs would eat you alive. Four? I thought you and Kyle had three dogs. We took in another one. You sound like mom. I know. Let's go. Which ones seem creamier or yellowish to you? Yeah, I agree. None of them are right. Don't get too comfortable. I'm still looking for a new home for you. Wow Blair, that's some kind of dress. I'm glad you like it. It's Gucci. I wore it for an editorial in vogue, and they let me keep it... At least they didn't say anything when I took it. - What was the ad for? - Toothpaste... I think. Well, you look amazing in it. Well, amazing is what I was going for, so mission accomplished. It doesn't look like you've made much progress. Well, I haven't had a lot of time to work on it. Here, help me pick a color. They're white. No, that's the eggshell, that's ecru, that one's butter cream... That one... They're all white. What's that? You got a cat? You didn't tell me you got a cat. Well, he kind of got me. I rescued him from a dog, and now he's stuck to me like glue. I've been looking for a family to adopt him. Good. Just put it on craigslist or pet finder. Get rid of it. I'm kind of surprised you don't like cats. I thought you'd be more of an animal lover since your father owns a pet supply store. Cat's a new sense. You have to clean up after it, feed it. What if you wanted to go to Italy for Christmas on a whim? You're going to have to find somebody to look after it. It's like having a kid, only worse, because it never grows up and moves away. He's only here until I find him a new home anyway. That's why I like you so much. Good times, no strings. Now, please go get dressed. I made us reservations at Mangiamo. Oh, fancy. I want you to meet my friends. I just know you'll love them. Buonasera! And happy holidays. I saw you on the TV again last night. Hello, Ellio. Happy holidays to you, too. - Hi, Ellio. - May I take your... Puffy coat? Oh... yeah. Right this way, please. For you, we have reserved a beautiful table. So, for your birthday gift, I'm taking you on Sunday for a day of pampering. Oh, Sunday? I can't. Monday's my anatomy final. It's the last final of the semester. It's worth 60% of my grade. - So I gotta... - So bring your books. You never do anything for yourself. We're going, end of story. - Now catch us up. - Everything's really good. Yes, school's great. Work's great. I can't believe I'm going to be calling you "Dr. White" soon. Mom and dad would be so proud. Are you getting out at all? Have you met someone? No, I really, I don't really have time. - After I graduate and... - Marilee still has this silly rule. No love life till she graduates and starts her practice. It's not a silly rule. I just want to finish what I started. I can't afford any distractions right now. No. Kyle has this friend, Brad. He's a dentist. He's really handsome. You don't have to marry him, but just go on one date and see what happens. Do you remember what happened the last time you set me up on a date with one of Kyle's friends? That was not our fault. How were we supposed to know he was married? - He wasn't wearing a ring. - You ask. - Well, Brad is not married. - He's never even had a serious girlfriend. Why? What's wrong with him? Nothing. We could double date. We just want you to be as happy as we are. I'm calling Brad tomorrow morning. Actually, - I'm seeing someone. - What? He's a-he's a firefighter. Yeah, he saved the life of this woman who works in my market. Her... Her oven exploded. It was... it was just... Why didn't you tell us? Because of this. You guys get so excited. I didn't... We just started dating, okay? I don't even know if it's going to work out. - It's great news. - We have to meet him. No! Not... yet. Not yet. - When? - Soon. He's just, he's... he's really busy, you know, with fires and stuff. Tell us everything, leave nothing out, speak slowly. Ellio, we need more champagne! Craig's in the stock market and he made a bundle last year. I manage a private hedge fund. Blair tells us you're a fireman. Must be a lot of fun. Yeah, it's a blast. I admire you. I want you to know that. Thank you. Zachary buys and restores homes, too. He's in real estate. Oh... How exciting. A man of hidden talents. Yeah, I'm not at all what I seem. You know what, Kyle and I are invited to this big Christmas party on December 23rd at the mayor's house. Yeah, it's a fundraiser for the children's hospital, and... We just happen to have four tickets. You two will come with us. That's more than two weeks away. I don't even know if we're still going to be dating. I mean, it's so early in our... What's his name? His name? Is... I call him... "Brown Eyes". Just a silly little nickname that we have for each other, and... He calls me... "Marilee". Hi. Hi. - The... From the grocery store. - Yeah. How's Ambrose? You remembered his name? Of course. Have you found him a home yet? No. No, not yet. Who are you hiding from? Oh... I'm not hiding. I'm just getting some fresh air. Now, what does it say about the people we're with if we have to escape them to catch our breath? You love them too much? Or too little. I'm here with my little sister and her husband. I love them a lot, but she's a little overprotective. I'm here with a date and her friends. You have a girlfriend? Well, "girlfriend" implies a possible future. She's someone I'm dating. I don't really believe in the whole happily-ever-after, fairy-tale ending thing. Well, I believe in true love. - Are you married? - No. No, I'm focused on my education right now. I'll think about dating after I graduate and get a job. Well, what if you meet him before then? You can't find what you're not looking for. It's true. You know what I just learned? Mountain lions actually take a leap of faith in love. - They do? - Yeah. When a male finds a female that he's attracted to, he jumps in front of her, stopping her in her tracks, and then he climbs to the highest peak he can find, and starts howling, and professing his love for her. Yeah. If she joins him at the top of the mountain, they'll be together for life. It's... very romantic. How do they know who to choose? Instinct. What if I don't trust instinct? What if I need a guarantee? I don't think love has any guarantees. I think you just have to have faith, and believe it'll last. Well, I should probably get back to my date and her pretentious friends. Yeah. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Bye, Brown Eyes. I just said that out loud, didn't I? You kind of did. Could I be any more embarrassed? Because she’s a good girl, because she’s a good girl, because she’s a good girl, no one can deny it! I saw Brown Eyes today. Yeah. We talked for a long time. Don't look at me like that. I'm not even interested. Even if I was, he has a girlfriend, or rather somebody that he's dating. He doesn't believe in love. No. It's just you and me. And that's all I need for Christmas. Yeah. - Hey, Blair. - Good morning. - Did I wake you? - No, I slept in. My shift doesn't start till this afternoon. Is that the cat I hear? You're not letting it sleep in your bed, are you? Absolutely not. Sometimes. Yes. Zachary, that is just too much. You know what, tomorrow, we're going to take it to my father's pet supply store to find someone to adopt it. It's either that, or it goes to the shelter. He's pretty easy to take care of. I pretty much just feed him. What if we want to go to mount Everest on a whim? Or go skydiving, or parasailing? Who are we going to find to watch it? You want to do those things? No. I don't have a death wish. I'm just saying, do we really want to be tied down? I told my sister and brother-in-law that I would bring him to a holiday Christmas party on the 23rd so they could meet him. That's not a problem. We have two weeks to find you a date who has Brown Eyes. - I'll make you a profile on "Just Dessert". - No, I could never do that. Do you want to get your sister off your back? Then sign up, go to a "Just Dessert" gathering, find a date for your sister's party, then shut down the profile. I do not know... Do you want to die old, alone, in a housecoat, surrounded by cats, and dogs, and shattered dreams? I'm sorry, it's what my mother says to me. Anyway. Name, Marilee White. Age... 26. I'm 29. - Same thing. - Work? Student and pet supply store employee. Veterinarian, loves animals, red wine and long walks on the beach. I like white wine. What are you looking for in a man? A nice guy who likes animals, and understands that I just want a date to a party. Looking for a professional man who loves animals, is handsome, athletic, sexy... And has Brown Eyes. Don't write that. What did you just do? You'll thank me when you're happily married to a sexy lawyer and you have three children, - and a house full of animals. - Oh, God... - Wow! - What? You already have three happy cupcakes. That means that there are three guys that want to meet you. You have to go to the next party. It's a holiday mixer this Friday at a member's house. I'll text you the address. Promise me you'll go. Promise! Fine. - Morning. - Hey. Hey, I'm glad to see you're still around. Yeah, not for much longer. I'm taking him to get adopted tomorrow. Oh, that's a shame. It is, actually. I really kind of like the little guy. Why don't you just keep him, then? Well, Blair isn't too fond of him. Blair, huh? Well, you do what you want, but me? I don't trust a woman who doesn't like cats. - Just put him in the back of the truck. - No! I would never do that. He can ride in the front with us. But you have to hold him, please. Hold him? Me? Yeah, make sure he's safe. He's not really used to the cat carrier. I'm beginning to think you don't want to get rid of that cat. He deserves a better owner than me. Someone who's around more and can hang out with him. My father will find him a new home. I'm really glad we're doing this. Look what the cat dragged in for you on your birthday. The Blair Witch Project. Oh, man, what is she doing here? She never comes here. Maybe she needs to be declawed. - You work here, right? - Yes, Blair, I've worked here for three years. You think my name is Lynn. I remember. You have to help me get rid of this cat. - Find him a home. - What a sweet cat. Hey. Ambrose? You know its name? It says it right here on his collar. It belongs to my boyfriend. We have to get rid of it right away. You take it. Actually, if you do, I'll have my father give you all the cat food and kitty litter you'll ever need. - Hi, daddy! - Hi, sweetie. Sorry, are you following me? Actually... I work here, So... technically, you're following me. So, how's school? It... it's finals now, so... Just really busy studying, you know... It's all settled. Lynn is going to take the cat. I'm sorry, I can't. My apartment building doesn't take cats. Fine, we'll give it to a shelter. - No! - No! Did you see that? It has to go. It's dangerous. He was just playing. He wasn't trying to hurt you, Blair, come on. You call that vicious swipe it took at me "playful"? It wasn't a vicious swipe, it was a playful gesture. Excuse me? What do you think you are, a cat whisperer? Cats are like people. They can sense when they're not wanted. We're leaving. Daddy! Well, I guess we're leaving. Sorry, I didn't realize she was so... - Psychotic? - Sensitive. She'll be all right. Let's go! Right, well. - Yeah. - Thank you. By the way, my name is Zachary in case you continue to stalk me. Well, Marilee, in case you continue to stalk me. Come on, bud, let's go. - That woman is such a... - Marilee! Can you come to the office? Called into the boss's office? You think he knows it's your birthday? Well, I got a raise last year on my birthday, so... Happy Birthday! What's wrong? I just... I just got fired. What? Why? Blair told her father that I was rude to her. But... she's obnoxious. Everyone's rude to her. Well, I think he's scared of her. What does Zachary see in her? - Hey, leave a message. - Hi, Sarah... Oh, sorry, I'm not going to be able to make it to the mixer tonight. I'll see you in class. I read that petting a cat lowers your cholesterol. You know, it's crazy, but... I actually think that I sleep better when he's in the house. No adoption? No, not yet. But, Blair's still determined to get rid of him. You know, you're going to have to choose between her and that cat. Well, I say, keep the cat and give Blair my number. So we are going to take him on calls with us? We can't be seen with a cat. I like having a firehouse cat. Every firehouse has a dog. Ambrose makes us unique. - Yeah... - All right, you're the chief. So... What you're gonna do? Hi! I was in here the other day, and I'm looking for the woman who was working with you that day. - Marilee! - Yeah, Marilee, is she here? No, she no longer works here. - She was fired. - What? Why? Oh, your girlfriend, Blair, made a complaint to her father. I'm sure he didn't want to fire Marilee, because she's our best employee, but his daughter is a very beautiful, but horrible, superficial, nightmare of a human being. Yeah, I get it. She's putting herself through school. She needed this job. Wow! I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have her phone number or home address? Why? You want to burn down her house? What? No, I would like to apologize. Look, I had no idea that Blair got her fired. If I had, I promise you, I would have stopped her. Please, I feel awful about this. White. Her last name is White, and that is all I'm going to tell you. Any progress? No. She's not on Facebook, or LinkedIn, or anything. And I can't believe Blair had her fired. That is cold. You know, maybe I don't want her to have my number after all. You barely told us anything about this woman. What's she like? Well... She's wicked smart. Probably gets straight "a" s. Yeah, but more importantly... What she look like? What? What, I'm curious. She's really pretty. But she doesn't know it. That's the best kind of pretty. Is she nice? Unbelievably. She's got a really big heart, she's sweet, she loves cats. Wicked smart, beautiful but not full of herself, heart of gold, and sweet. What are you saying? Sounds like a special person. She is... Guys, could you finish that equipment inventory? Right after I beat Mark for a record fifth straight game. How about now? Now would be good. Don't be looking at my cards either. So, Marilee? She doesn't want to date until she finishes school and starts her career. Besides, she's not the kind of girl I usually go out with anyway. She believes in true love and marriage. You know, just because your parents couldn't make it work out, doesn't mean you can't. No, thank you. And yet, you're here searching for this... ...very smart, pretty, nice girl. Yeah, just to apologize. Right. Don't you want to have a family someday? Someone you can share the holidays with? You and the guys are my family. Hey, you can't snuggle up with me and the guys on a cold night after a long day's work. So that's a firm no? ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring ♪ ♪ to you and your kin ♪ ♪ Good tidings for Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring to you... ♪ Okay, so here's the thing, looks like we're going to be stuck with each other for a little while. You can stay here until I sell the house, but then you're on your own. New rules, we come and go as we please. You're not responsible for me, I'm not responsible for you. We're just a couple of bachelors living together. Good talk. Let's go watch the game. Hey... what are you doing here? I thought you had a commercial shoot? Got postponed. Surprise! I made dinner. Where's Ambrose? I don't know. I thought he was with you. No, and he always greets me when I come home. I'm sure he's around here somewhere. Ambrose, where are you? Just forget about the cat. Go get in the shower, I'm going to put dinner on the table. Ambrose? Ambrose? I wonder if he got out somehow. - I'm going to go find him. - Why? No, he'll be fine. You really don't get it, do you? What? Did you really have that woman who works at your father's store fired? Yes, she was horrible. She talked back to me. - She was a total... - So you had her fired? You can't do that, Blair. You... can't just have somebody fired because you don't like them. Look... Everything's okay. She doesn't matter and the cat is gone. Everything's back to normal. This isn't working. What? You and me. You're kidding me, right? No. You're breaking up with me? That's the way it looks. I'm a professional model, and you're breaking up with me? I wasted my entire night cooking for you. I got my hair done. These are expensive highlights. I know you didn't cook, Blair. You left the packages from Mario's, they're still in the trash, right where I can see them. I also know you didn't cook, because I just bought that stove, and it's not connected yet. Trust me, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to you, and you're going to regret this. You're gonna call and you're going to beg for me to come back. Guess what? I won't. Ambrose? Ambrose! Ambrose, where are you, buddy? Ambrose? I can't remember the last time I got a Mani/Pedi. That's just the beginning. You need to take time to pamper yourself. All you do is volunteer and work and study. I should be studying right now. No, you need to go with your little sister to get your hair and makeup done and then go shopping for a new dress. That was our deal. I don't know, I've already been gone so long... Marilee... I just... Stop. Breathe. Okay? Enjoy the holiday season. Better? - Better. - Good. You deserve this. Come on. I deserve this. Are you almost done in there? Just about. Wow! This dress is beautiful. No, you're beautiful, and Brown Eyes is going to faint when he sees you. No, no, I can't afford this. Not a problem. I sold three houses this month, and I want to take care of you for once. - It's too much. - Marilee. When mom and dad died, you came home and put your life on hold to take care of me. You have done so much for me, and the dress is nothing. You look like mom. I do? Yeah, you really do. Pinky swear? I love you. I love you. Why are we stopping here? You don't think I'm taking you home looking like this. You're going to go in there and make Brown Eyes faint. No, I... I'll go in with you. I want to meet this guy anyway. I have to study for my anatomy final tomorrow. I have to go home now. If you don't go in there and show him how you look, I'm going to drag you in. Wait! I'll go in. I'll go in. Good. He's going to be so surprised. You have no idea. I want to... I need to go in there by myself. Because... He's going to wanna... Grab me and kiss me all over, and it would be awkward if you were standing there. You'll meet him at the Christmas party. Okay, fine. Go. I'll wait for you here. No, you just... You go home. Yeah. He-he'll give me a ride. He's... Getting off shift right now. - Are you sure? - Yes. Yeah. Have fun. Thank you for today. You're welcome. Here I go. Just... See ya. Okay... Ambrose? Ambrose... What are you doing out here? Are you lost? Oh, babe... Okay. Hi... I'm looking for the owner of this cat? - He's mine! - He's mine! Actually, I think he belongs to a guy named Zachary. Zach! Someone is here to see you. Okay. - Hey, it's you. - Hi. And Ambrose. I found him wandering outside. I thought he might be lost. - Hey, buddy... - Yeah. I've been looking for you guys, and here you are together. You were looking for me? - Why? - Yeah... I wanted to apologize. I'm so sorry about your job. It's my fault that you got fired. You don't have to... It's not you, it was your girlfriend. She's... She's not my girlfriend anymore. Oh! That's great. I mean, in a... In a sad way. Well, you've got Ambrose back now, so... Yeah. You know, actually, I'm getting off work soon. Can I give you a ride, or buy you dinner? You don't have to do that. I'm fine. I can... I can walk home. Let me buy you dinner. It's the least I can do. - It's the least he can do. - It's the least he can do. Well, that's nice of you, but only if I can take you to my favorite place. Yeah. Should I go home and change? I know the owner pretty well. I think I can get you in dressed like that. - What about Ambrose? - He's used to being here. He's the firehouse cat. - He's our mascot. - We're determined to be unique. We like having him around. Okay. Okay, we've got two beef tacos, one burrito, and one chicken taco. So, this is your favorite place? Yes, it's like a surprise party in your mouth, and he's open all night. If I'm studying late, I usually end up here. I'm game. You're right, - that was amazing. - I know, right? Are you cold? - No, no, I'm fine. - I'll be right back. When I was in college, my parents died in a car accident, so I went back home to take care of my little sister until she graduated from high school. When she went off to college, I went back to get my degree and started veterinary school. Why a vet? My parents were huge animal lovers. I guess it rubbed off on me and my sister. My mom would take in every stray she could find. When I was seven, I was walking home from school, and there was this baby bird in the middle of the road. He had fallen out of his nest. So I picked him up, I took him home, I nursed him back to health, I was there for his first flight. God, I totally forgot about that, but you're right. That was when I knew I wanted to be a vet. How about you? What made you want to be a firefighter? What was your defining moment? Well, when I was about 14, our house caught on fire, and I was trapped in the bedroom, terrified, until this amazing firefighter crashed through my bedroom window and saved my life. That was the moment you decided you wanted to be a firefighter? Well, it was the moment I decided I didn't want to be angry anymore. My parents fought all the time... They're divorced now... And it made me a pretty angry kid. That was the moment I decided I wanted to do something that would make a difference, so I started focusing on helping people, the way I was helped. That's powerful. What were your parents like? My parents... Loved each other so much. When my mom walked into the room, my dad would just... light up. They met each other in high school, and that was it. He stopped her in her tracks and she joined him on the mountain. Exactly. This has been really nice, but I... I have an anatomy final in the morning. I... should probably go. Yeah. No problem. I'll take you home. Thank you for dinner. Thank you for accepting my apology. Well, good night. Good night, and good luck on the final. Thank you. That test was so hard. Oh, I'm sure you did fine. At least it was the last one, 'cause Christmas break is funny! - Hi! - Hi! How the test go? I think I did pretty well. Great. Can I take you out to coffee to celebrate? - That's Brown Eyes? - Okay... - Hi. - Hi. You know what, dinner was enough... You went to dinner with him? Let him take you for coffee. - Yeah. - Besides, you still have my coat, and, you know, I kind of need that back. - Right. - Go! Yes! Have fun. I love that coffee shop. I've never been there before. Yeah, well, firemen and policemen always know where the best coffee is. Oh, no... What is it? She found Queenie. I knew you were hiding something. The plumber came in to check on the sink, and guess what he found? - Where is she? - I put her in the back. Queenie? Sweetie? Hey, sweetie. Are you okay? Oh, were you scared? This is a clear violation of Angel Arms' bylaws. It's a class-two infraction, which is clearly spelled out... I assume you gave this tenant 48-hours' notice before a service person entered the residence. - Well, I'm not sure if... - What about fire codes? Are you up to date on the 456 city fire codes pertaining to apartment buildings, and the mandatory bylaws stipulated in the state statutes? I... I'll be back next week to make sure you're in compliance with each and every state and city fire code. I hope I won't have to write you a 777, shut down your apartment building. Thank you so much. I can't thank you enough. It's not a problem. Thank you. Sorry that I couldn't keep her from evicting you. But I'll make her life as miserable as I can for a while. Well, I guess I could stay at my sister's house. I don't know how Queenie will survive her dogs, though. - I have an idea. - Oh, yeah? This house is amazing. Yeah, it will be once I get it painted. Come on. Oh! The house is great. Oh, I love the crown molding and the hardwood floors. The staircase is beautiful. Thank you. I built it. - Really? - Yeah. Wow! Come on, I'll give you the two-cent tour. There's an apartment upstairs with a separate entrance. It's not much, but you're welcome to it until you find a place. Thank you. But I couldn't do that. I couldn't impose. No, please, I insist, I'm the reason you got fired. Do you allow cats? Allow them? We require them. You can't stay here unless you have at least one cat. I'm going to pay rent. That's not necessary. But you could, you know, help out around the house if you want. Maybe take care of Ambrose when I don't take him into work. I think he likes her. Yeah, Queenie is usually so shy, but I think she likes him, too. I guess it could work, us living together. Well, not living together, you know, sleeping together... ...not sleeping together... but li... and you know, under... the-the same roof... - You know what I mean. - Yeah, I do. I'm going to stay out of your way. You won't even know that I'm here. I should have a new job and somewhere to live by the end of the week. No hurry. We should get your stuff, though. I have to go to work soon. You just make yourself at home. It's perfect. It's a layer of eggshell over ecru. It's really the only way to get pearl. It's the exact shade of white that I wanted but couldn't find. How did you do all this? School's on Christmas break, and I don't have a job. It's the least I could do for you rescuing Queenie and me. Thank you. It looks really great. I'm used to having so much to do. I'm not very good at doing nothing. Well, I appreciate it. Look at those two. They haven't left each other's side since they met. I'm glad they're getting along so well. There's chicken and potatoes on the stove if you're hungry. It smells great. Where did you get it from? I cooked. I hope you don't mind, I connected the stove. You... Really? - Yeah. - Wow! That's... Well, I'll see you later. It was pretty quiet at the station, so I'm not tired... If you wanted to stay and eat with me. Us. Thanks, I already ate, but... Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Don't look at me like that. It's not my fault they left. I asked them both to stay. Oh, sure, blame me. Of course, we shouldn't have stayed for dinner. He was only offering to be nice. He probably has a girl coming over later. Yeah. What are you up to there? Curbside value. When you're trying to sell a house, Christmas spirit can go a long way. Well, thank you. Yeah. My sister's in real estate. She says the more homey you can make a house feel, the better. - Have a good day. - You too. Yeah. I actually have an appointment to look at some tile. You wouldn't want to go, would you? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I could. All right. There's this other thing I have to do first. It's sort of important. What's that? I have to give a speech to a group of fascinating people. You might like it. Should I dress up? I think I can get you in dressed like that. Did you guys know that the leading cause of Christmas tree fires is from dry trees? So remember, get your parents to give your tree a drink every night to keep it from drying out. - All right? You guys got that? - Got it! Alright. Who in their right mind barbecues a turkey in the fireplace? The holidays make people do crazy things. Yeah, I was saying the same thing to Marilee after my talk at the school. Wait, what, you took her with you? She's living with him now. He's falling in love. - That's not true. - Sorry. He's falling in love, but doesn't know it yet. Tell me that's not true, Zach. You're my idol. Playing the field, no commitment, no responsibility. Don't worry, nothing's changed. I'm not in love and I'm still never getting married. Really? Can you say no to these three things? You live with her? Yes. You spend all your free time with her? Yes. You think about her when you're not with her? No! No. I don't live with her. She's only staying with me till she finds her a new place, and I only spend time with her because she's there. You are five minutes from marrying this girl. Okay, so wait, wait, wait, so, what are you saying, he's human after all. Come on, Zach, say it ain't so. This girl is a temporary roommate, nothing else. Right. Hey, why don't we hit the stores tomorrow, and we don't stop until we've found all our Christmas presents? Sure. It'll be way more fun if we do it together, and then we can get a Christmas tree. Do you believe in love at first sight? What? Look at those two. They make it look easy. My mother used to say falling in love with the right person is easy. I've never felt that. Yeah, me neither, but it doesn't mean it's not true. I haven't had a Christmas tree in a while. Really, why? Well, I buy houses, I fix them up and I sell them. I never usually stay in one long enough to care about the holidays. I can't imagine Christmas without one. It's my favorite part about it. So how do you choose which one? - Well, that is pretty scientific. - Okay. First, you've got to check to make sure it's fresh. Then you've got to inhale deeply to see if the scent is Christmassy. - That's not a word. - Yes, it is. "Christmassy" is definitely a word. It's an adjective. It means to be filled with Christmas spirit. Okay, I see. Then you're going to give it the lean test. You're going to look straight on at your tree to make sure that it's even, then you've got to lean to the right... Then you've got to lean to the left... And then back straight, and if it's all good, you've found your one. - That is very scientific. - Yes. There it is. There's the one. The one? There's only one? How do you know? And what if you're wrong? What if you commit to it and realize it's not the one, then you... Yeah, it's a good tree. When I was a little girl, there was always one Christmas present under the tree that was unaccounted for. My parents said they didn't buy it, so... that's how my sister and I knew it was from Santa. It was always my favorite present. What are your favorite Christmas traditions? I usually end up working Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The guys with families really want the time off, so I end up being the guy who holds down the fort. It must be hard. It's no big deal. What do you do for Christmas? This year, on Christmas, I'm volunteering at a big pet-rescue adoption the shelter is putting on in the park. Then I'll go to my sister's for dinner. You know, I really want to thank you again for all the work you did around the house. I may be able to sell it sooner than I thought. That's great. You didn't just fix up another house this time. You built a real home... ...for a real family. Nothing's happening. We're just roommates. But you're both single and you like each other. It's not like that. He's not even looking for a serious relationship. He dates models, and I am... I don't have time to date because I'm busy. But you live together and you spend all your free time together. - It's not like that. - That's crazy. I mean, you're perfect together. You enjoy each other's company, you get along great and your cats are best friends. I mean, how many more clues do you need? I'm not going down that road. Okay, I'm not going to fall for somebody who's clearly not interested in a serious relationship. You can't decide not to fall in love with someone. It just happens. Do you want to know how he feels about you? You know, test the waters? Use this. What is that? - Mistletoe. - That's not mistletoe. It's a metaphor. Go get some mistletoe, put it in the house. If he stands underneath it, gives you a kiss on the cheek, then he just wants to be friends. But if he kisses you on the lips, then he really likes you. That... That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I would never do that, not in a million years. It's nothing. Just decorating. Don't judge me. Okay. Hey! Welcome home! - Hey! - Hey. - How was your day? - Good! Great! Great... How-how was yours? - Oh... Great. - Good... Well... I'll see you later. Oh, you're leaving? Yeah. Why? I just... I just thought maybe you could help me... ...grout the kitchen sink. Sure. Yeah, I could do that. Get it down, get it down. Sorry. I didn't have a choice. What? Mistletoe. Oh! Yes... Oh, no... This cannot be happening. This is... This is not happening, not to me. Calm down. It's not such a bad thing. Answer me this. There's a fourth step before you fall off the cliff. I thought you said there were only three. It varies. Has she asked you to meet her family yet? No. Not yet. Well, there's that, then. - Yeah, but have you kissed her? - No. Yes. But it was only because of mistletoe, okay? I didn't have a choice. He's toast. You didn't come home till really late last night. Was everything okay at work? Yeah, I do that sometimes, just kind of go with the flow, blow wherever the wind takes me. So I guess things are permanent now. You have a family. What? Wait a minute, what do you mean? You and Ambrose. You're not looking for a home for him anymore. - He's your family. - Yeah. I guess so. Are you okay? Is something wrong? No. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. There's this... thing I have to do tonight. Yeah? What's that? It's nothing, really, it's just a party my sister and her husband invited me to. I can bring someone if I want. You want me to meet your family? I just thought it would be something fun thing to do. You'd really like my sister and brother-in-law. They're great. I'm sorry, but I can't. Yeah, I mean, of course. I mean, it's... It's totally last minute and everything. No, it's just that I have this work thing that I have to do. I would like to, but I just can't. I thought you were off tonight. I was, but it got changed. So... Man, it's later than I thought. I actually have to get to work. I'll see you when I get back, if you're here, otherwise I'll see you when I see you. - Okay. - Okay. Are you sure everything's okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Bye. - Hi! - Hi. You made it. - Hi. How are you? - You look great. Yeah, thanks. - So, where is he? - Yeah, where is Brown Eyes? I'm sorry, he couldn't make it. He had a work thing. Oh! That's too bad. I'm sorry. They're clients. Will you excuse us one second? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - You sure? - Yeah... I'll just... I'm sorry. - Hey. - Hey. I was just writing you a note. I thought I'd be gone before you got home. Gone? How was work? It was fine. Where you're going? I finally got a job and found a place that takes cats. Thank you so much for letting Queenie and me stay here. It was really kind of you. Yeah. Y-You don't have to go. You can stay. I really appreciate everything. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas. But what about Ambrose? He's going to miss you guys. - He is? - Yeah. Yeah, he has a... He has a real connection with Queenie. Well, maybe I can bring her by sometime. That would be great. You should definitely do that. I'll call you, set something up in the new year. In the new year? Hey, buddy. Hey... Why are you so sad? This is what we wanted, right? Yeah, maybe not. She just moved out, found a new place to live. Probably for the best. I don't want to lead her on. No, you wouldn't want to do that. I mean, it's not like I was in love with her. I liked her. I mean, who wouldn't? She's wonderful. Zachary, - What are you so afraid of? - Nothing. Harriet and I have been married for 26 years, and I don't regret one day of it. She and the kids give my life meaning. I know, and that's a great life for you. It's just not for me. Because you're different? Exactly. What about Ambrose? Do you care about him, or have you just gotten used to him being around? That's different. He's a great cat and he needs me. But you don't need anyone? No. Remember when you were a kid, and I crashed through your bedroom window that night and saved you from the fire? Yes. You decided that day to become a firefighter, right? That was years ago, you still know it was the right decision. That was a defining moment. This, right here, right now, this is another defining moment. If you care about that girl, you need to go find her and tell her how you feel. That's great, but I just... I don't know where to find her, Sam. Ambrose... Where... is Marilee? He's not Lassie. He's not going to lead you to her. It's Christmas Eve, though, a time for miracles. Maybe... Maybe she'll walk right through that door right now and tell you she loves you. It was worth a shot. Thanks for coming down and hanging out with me. Hey, no problem. Merry Christmas, Zachary. Merry Christmas, Sam. He told me he didn't want a serious relationship. Yes, he did. And I told him I didn't want to date until after I graduate. Yes, you did. And then he told me he was going to work, but he wasn't going to work, he was-he was on a date with a... With a beautiful woman. - He lied. - Yes, he did. But he didn't really lie. I'm not even dating him. He doesn't owe me anything. I... - But we've been over all that. - He told me... What's with the kiss? See, that was my fault. The mistletoe-kiss test? Clearly flawed. - Yeah. - Yeah... - Will you please answer it this time? - No. No. No. He's clearly interested in someone else. I'll call him in a few weeks, you know, when I'm... Over him. You're going to get over him? - Yeah... - Yeah... Okay. Hi, Marilee, it's Zachary calling again. I just wanted to say Merry Christmas, and, I hope you're having a great Christmas Eve. Just wanted to call and say that... Ambrose and I miss you and Queenie and... Give us a call. Merry Christmas. - Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! - Santa! - Santa! - Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Well, we blew it, Ambrose. We let them get away. Okay, I blew it. This is the worst Christmas ever. What do you want me to do? If I knew where she was, I would go get her. You're a genius, Ambrose. And this little guy is very good with kids. What are you doing here? Ambrose. He reminded me that you volunteer here for Christmas. He did? I don't understand why you're here. I thought you'd be with your new girlfriend? What new girlfriend? The one I saw you with at the mayor's Christmas party. What, you were at that party? Yeah, that's the party I invited you to, but you had to work. And then you were there with the woman in the red dress. I was there to promote the firefighter's calendar. It's something we do every Christmas to raise money for the children's hospital, and that woman was the mayor's wife. Marilee White... you are the smartest and most beautiful woman I've ever met, and I love that you know the right shade of white, I love that you know how to install a stove and cook dinner, that you love animals, and I love that you know how to buy a Christmas tree, and I love that you believe in love and made me believe. I know you want to finish school and start your practice before you find love, but sometimes, it finds you when you weren't even looking. I want to jump in front of you... ...stop you in your tracks. Mountain lions. I'm climbing to the highest peak I can find, if you join me, I know we will be together forever. I love you. I love you... Synchronized by Gya Lee
