PILON. PILON, ARE YOU AWAKE, MY FRIEND? I DON'T KNOW. AND THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL WAY TO BE. IT'S PAST NOON. WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT GETTING SOMETHING TO EAT. THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT. YOU KNOW, THE MACKEREL SHOULD BE RUNNING GOOD TODAY. TWO BOATS HAVE ALREADY COME IN. YOU LIKE MACKEREL, PILON? I LIKE T-BONE STEAK. YEAH, SURE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FISH, I DON'T KNOW. I LIKE MACKEREL. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE NICE, PILON? IF YOU HAD A TRAINED PELICAN. AND EVERY TIME YOU WANTED A FISH, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, JUST SEND HIM OUT TO DIVE FOR ONE. YOU COULD TRAIN A PELICAN LIKE THAT, YES? NO. OH. WHY NOT? BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB. A PELICAN IS DUMB, TOO, BUT NOT THAT DUMB. HE WOULD EAT THE FISH HIMSELF. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I SAID IF YOU TRAIN ONE-- SHUT UP, SHUT UP. I GOTTA THINK, I GOTTA THINK. YOU WANT MACKEREL, EH? OH, BETTER THAN ANY FISH. I THINK I COULD EAT A MACKEREL MYSELF TODAY. YEAH. ALRIGHT, I TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO. WHAT? YOU GO GET A WHOLE HANDFUL OF ROCKS. ROCKS? THEN YOU GO DOWN TO THE DOCK, AND WHEN THE OTHER BOATS COME, YOU CALL THE FISHERMEN NAMES AND THROW ROCKS AT THEM. I'LL GET ARRESTED. NO. YOU WILL GET MACKEREL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE FISHERMEN ARE GONNA THROW BACK? THEIR OARS AND THEIR NETS? NO. THEY CAN THROW ONLY FISH. AMIGO! WHY, THAT'S WONDERFUL! HEY, HOW'D YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING? IT IS A GOOD WAY TO TRADE. COME ON. COME ON, THEN. NO. I WILL STAY HERE. BUT TWO OF US CAN THROW MORE ROCKS AND GET MORE FISH. YOU WANT WINE WITH YOUR FISH, NO? WINE. AIN'T GONNA GET IT. I WILL STAY HERE AND THINK OF A WAY TO GET IT. IS EITHER OF YOU NAMED PILON? UH, WHAT IS IT YOU WISH, SENOR? WELL, TO BEGIN WITH, THERE'S MY CARD. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? CUMMINGS. PAUL D. CUMMINGS. I'M A LAWYER. WE'VE DONE NOTHING. I'M LOOKING FOR A YOUNG FELLOW NAMED DANIEL ALVAREZ. THEY TOLD ME IN TOWN ONE OF YOU PAISANOS MIGHT KNOW HIM. DANNY ALVAREZ? DANNY ALVAREZ. NO LAWYER'LL DO DANNY ANY GOOD NOW. IT'S TOO LATE. HE'S ALREADY IN JAIL. IN JAIL? SURE. WHAT FOR? WELL... THEY SAID IT WAS SOME KIND OF CONDUCT. DISORDERLY, I THINK. YEAH. HE WAS DRUNK, TOO. SOME EVIL PERSON GAVE HIM SOME BAD WINE. THAT'S RIGHT, IN A POOL ROOM. AND IT MADE HIM THROW A 6-BALL OUT THE WINDOW. AND LATER HE FOUND HIMSELF HITTING A POLICEMAN ON THE HEA-- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING AFTER MACKEREL? WELL, SURE I'M GOING. YEAH. IS HE HERE IN THE LOCAL JAIL? SENOR, IF IT IS SO IMPORTANT, I WILL BE GLAD TO SIT IN THE SEAT OF YOUR CAR AND SHOW YOU TO HIM. Guard: HEY, WHO'S THAT? HA HA! THAT'S THE JUDGE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. WHY? DON'T IT LOOK LIKE HIM? YES, A LITTLE. BUT HE'S A JUDGE. YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE RESPECT. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. HEY, WHO'S THAT? YOU. SMEARIN' MY WALLS LIKE THIS. AIN'T YOU GOT NOTHIN' BETTER TO DO? NO. DEAD AROUND HERE. DOESN'T ANYBODY ELSE GET ARRESTED ANYMORE? YOU GOT COMPANY. WHO? IT'S PILON AND SOME MAN. YOU WANT TO SEE THEM? SURE, SURE. ARE YOU DANIEL ALVAREZ? THAT'S ME. HELLO, PILON. HELLO. AMIGO, THIS IS A LAWYER WHO CAME FROM STOCKTON JUST TO SEE YOU. STOCKTON, TO SEE ME? I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN 3 YEARS. IT'S A LIE. YES, I CAN SWEAR TO IT. HE'S BEEN HERE WITH ME. NO ONE'S ACCUSING YOU. YOU REMEMBER YOUR GRANDFATHER PETER ALVAREZ? THE VIEJO? SURE. HOW IS HE? HE'S DEAD. OH. HE WAS A NICE OLD FELLA. HE DIED LAST MONTH. AND AS HIS EXECUTOR, I'M THOROUGHLY SHOCKED AND ASHAMED TO FIND HIS ONE AND ONLY HEIR IN A COMMON JAIL. HE WAS-- OH, HE LEFT SOMETHING-- JUST A MOMENT. YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A PAISANO, TOO, BUT HE WAS A GOOD MAN. A SOBER MAN. A HARD WORKER. HE HAD LOTS OF MONEY, DANNY'S GRANDFATHER? WILL YOU PLEASE BE QUIET? AND BY THE TERMS OF HIS WILL, YOU ARE HEIR TO TWO HOUSES SITUATED ON TORTILLA FLATS. TWO HOUSES. AND THE REST, IT IS ALL MONEY? THE LIQUID ASSETS OF THE ESTATE WERE JUST SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE FUNERAL EXPENSES, OUTSTANDING DEBTS, AND SO FORTH. NO MONEY. JUST THE HOUSES. THERE'S ONE THING MORE. THIS WAS HIS WATCH. IT BELONGS TO YOU NOW. YES. I REMEMBER THIS WATCH. WILL YOU SIGN YOUR NAME, PLEASE? HUH? SURE. SURE. OH, DANNY CAN WRITE. DANNY WENT TO SCHOOL UNTIL HE WAS 11. SURE. TWO HOUSES. THAT'S A FINE START IN LIFE. BETTER THAN MOST AMERICAN BOYS HAVE. THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY. GOODBYE, SIR. MAKES A GOOD SPEECH. YEAH, LIKE AN OLD GOAT IN THE MOONLIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T TALK LIKE THAT. NOW YOU ARE A MAN OF PROPERTY. YOU SHOULD CELEBRATE. A FIESTA. I'D LIKE A DRINK, ALRIGHT. YEAH. YOUR GRANDFATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT YOU SOME WINE. YES. YES, IT IS TOO BAD HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU SOMETHING OF VALUE. LIKE MONEY. THE WATCH. THE WATCH! TORRELLI WOULD GIVE US LOTS OF WINE FOR THAT WATCH. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THIS IS THE WATCH OF HIS GRANDFATHER. OR MAYBE YOU HAVE NO FEELING ABOUT SUCH THINGS, DANNY. MOST PEOPLE DO NOT. THAT IS A GOOD WATCH. IT SHOWS THE TIME. SURE, SURE. BUT... SAY THE HAND, IT--IT POINTS TO 7. IT IS SUMMERTIME. 7:00 IS A GOOD TIME TO GET UP IN THE SUMMERTIME. SURE. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WINTER COMES? WHAT GOOD IS 7:00 THEN? IT'S COLD AND DARK. YOU WANNA GET UP AT 7:00 IN WINTERTIME? NO! SEE, YOU CANNOT TRUST A WATCH. THE ONLY THING YOU CAN TRUST IS THE SUN. THAT IS GOLD, TOO, AND BIGGER. AND ALWAYS COSTS NOTHING. THIS WATCH COST ME NOTHING. YOU WILL FIND OUT. YOU WILL HAVE TO POLISH IT. YOU HAVE TO WIND IT. ALWAYS YOU ARE AFRAID IT'S GOING TO BE STOLEN. IT'S A LOAD ON YOUR BACK THAT NEVER COMES OFF. TAKE IT. IT WILL MAKE A BURRO OF YOU. I NEVER ASKED TO BE LEFT THIS WATCH. THE WATCH OR SOME WINE? WHICH DO YOU WANT? WINE. YOU DON'T GET WINE HERE. I CAN GET MY GUITAR BACK FROM TORRELLI'S, TOO? SURE. HEY, WAIT! NO, HE CAN'T GO. HE'S A PRISONER. YOU GET THE WINE FROM TORRELLI, AND WE'LL DRINK IT HERE. WHAT TALK IS THIS? YOU WANT OUR FRIEND TO CELEBRATE IN PRISON? YOU HAVE A CHIPMUNK'S HEART. HE HASN'T FINISHED HIS 10 DAYS. HE STILL HAS ONE MORE DAY. LISTEN, TITO, I'LL COME BACK WITH YOU. BUT I GOTTA FEED HIM WHEN HE WAKES UP. YOU BRING HIM SOME NICE WINE, TOO. COME ON, COME ON. HIS GRANDFATHER, EH? HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T STEAL IT? ASK TITO RALPH. NO. THE LAWYER BROUGHT IT. WELL, IT'S PRETTY OLD. MAYBE IT WON'T GO RIGHT ANYMORE, EH? I'LL GIVE YOU ONE GALLON AND YOUR GUITAR. ONE GALLON? OH, TORRELLI, AMIGO. TORRELLI, DO YOU THINK DANNY WOULD PART FOR THIS FOR WINE IF IT WAS NOT THAT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER'S FATHER HAS MADE HIM SO SAD? NOT DANNY. HELLO, CESCA. HELLO, DANNY. NO, YOU STAY HERE. GO ON INSIDE. GO ON. BUT ALL THAT WOOD, I THOUGHT MAYBE I-- [LAUGHTER] Torrelli: WE TALK ABOUT WINE, NOT WOOD. AND YOU GET TWO GALLON, NO MORE! TORRELLI, AMIGO, I CANNOT HELP IT. THE TEETH OF YOUR WIFE, THEY ARE SO GAY AND BRIGHT WHEN SHE LAUGHS. AND THE GOLD IN THEM IS BEAUTIFUL, AS BEAUTIFUL AS IN THIS WATCH ALMOST. SURELY THE TEETH OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE ARE WORTH 3 GALLONS? I SAID TWO-- OH, NOW, TORRELLI. SURE, WE CAN GIVE THEM 3 GALLONS, THEY'RE GOOD CUSTOMERS. HE'LL MAKE IT UP SOME OTHER WAY. ALRIGHT, BUT I LOSE MONEY. SO, THE WINE. IT IS TOO BAD NOW WE HAVE NOT GOT SOMEPLACE TO DRINK IT. I DON'T NEED A PLACE. YOU JUST DRINK IT. WITH YOU, IT IS DIFFERENT NOW. A MAN WITH TWO HOUSES CAN DRINK WITH THE MAYOR. WHILE HIS POOR FRIENDS, THE PAISANOS, THEY MUST GO OUT UNDER THE HOT SUN SOMEPLACE AND DRINK. TWO HOUSES. I FORGOT. LET'S GO UP AND LOOK AT THEM. WE'LL TAKE WINE AND HAVE A PARTY. WE GOT NO TIME FOR A PARTY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN JAIL. YOU WANNA GET ME IN TROUBLE? LOOK, LOOK, DID YOU EVER HEAR OF PAROLE? WHAT IS THAT?

[CHILDREN LAUGHING] Woman: HELLO, BOYS! MRS. TERESINA! AH, THE NEW BABY. WHEN DID IT COME? YESTERDAY. I WAS PICKING BEANS. AH. BUT YOU BOYS ARE CARRYING SOMETHING TOO, EH? WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PARTY. DANNY IS A BIG PROPERTY OWNER NOW. TWO HOUSES HIS GRANDFATHER LEFT HIM. AY, AY. Child: PILON! PILON! COME LOOK! WE GOT A BIG BLACK SPIDER! GOT RED SPOTS ON IT. A BLACK SPIDER! WHAT DO YOU SAY?

WHY, BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT HORNS, TOO? HA HA HA! COME ON. COME ON. STAY AWAY FROM HER, SHE'S A PORTAGEE GIRL. PORTAGEE GIRLS ARE NO GOOD. WHY? THEY ALWAYS WANT TO GET MARRIED. COME ON. HEY, IT'S REALLY A HOUSE, AIN'T IT? YEAH. MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GO LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE NOW, EH? NO, NO. I KNOW THE OTHER HOUSE. THIS IS MUCH BETTER. YES, I THINK WE WILL BE VERY HAPPY HERE. WHO LIVES THERE? MRS. MARELLIS. LOOK AT ALL THE CHICKENS SHE HAS. QUIET. [CHICKENS CLUCKING] HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S A GOOD FENCE. SURE. I AM ONLY THINKING OF MRS. MARELLIS' POOR CHICKENS. SHE HAS NO TALL WEEDS IN HER YARD. NOW THE CHICKENS CAN COME OVER AND MAKE THEIR NESTS IN THE NICE WEEDS HERE, SEE? OH, SURE. LET'S GO IN, EH? Woman: WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE? Pilon: HELLO, MRS. MARELLIS. NOBODY LIVES THERE. OH, YEAH. SURE, SURE. DANNY LIVES HERE NOW. IT WAS LEFT TO HIM. DANNY ALVAREZ? WELL. THAT'S NICE, TO BE NEIGHBORS, DANNY. HA HA! SURE. [HUMMING] THREE ROOMS.

YOU'RE STARTING ALREADY. THIS IS NO GOOD. WHAT IS NO GOOD? ALREADY YOU ARE A PROPERTY OWNER. YOU'RE AFRAID FOR YOUR PROPERTY. WELL, BUT-- Pablo: AMIGOS! AMIGOS! THERE IS NO WATER. THERE'S NO WATER FROM THE PIPE. WHY DO YOU WANT WATER? TO CLEAN AND COOK FISH. THE COMPANY'S GOT TO TURN ON THE WATER. IT IS PABLO'S FISH. HE'LL GO DOWN AND HAVE IT DONE. MY FISH? YOU WANT TO STAY HERE RIGHT? SURE. WELL, SHUT UP. COMPANY WON'T WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. IT'S $3.00, I THINK. I HAVEN'T GOT $3.00. THEN I DON'T HAVE TO GO. LET'S DRINK. NO, NO. HERE. TAKE THESE DOWN TO THE JUNK SHOP. SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET. WE WILL GET WATER FROM MRS. MARELLIS. HEY, WHAT HAPPENS? WE NEED GROCERIES FOR THE PARTY, NO? THIS IS PART OF THE FURNITURE. I KNOW, BUT IT'LL BREAK. AFTER THEY'RE BROKEN, YOU'LL BE SAD. IT'S BETTER YOU NEVER HAD THEM AT ALL. BUT THESE THINGS BELONGED TO MY GRANDFATHER. NOW THEY ARE MINE. IT IS STRANGE. WHEN A MAN IS POOR, HE THINKS TO HIMSELF, "IF I HAD MONEY, I'D SHARE IT WITH MY FRIENDS." THEN THE MONEY COMES, AND HIS BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS FLY AWAY. HE FORGETS HIS FRIENDS, WHO SHARED THINGS WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS POOR. C'MON, WE'LL DRINK IN THE ALLEY. NO, PILON, NO. YOU ARE ALL MY FRIENDS, ALWAYS. HERE. DON'T FORGET THE BACON FOR THE FISH. THE BACON. DON'T BE ALL NIGHT. DANNY AND ME, WE GOTTA GO BACK TO JAIL. AND GET A LOAF OF BREAD. TWO LOAVES. AND A CAN OF COFFEE. COFFEE, BREAD... WAIT A MINUTE. THESE THINGS WON'T BUY ALL THAT.

WHEN YOU GO TO GET THE WATER FROM MRS. MARELLIS, YOU COULD GIVE HER THESE. NO. NOW, WAIT. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO, WHEN YOU'RE A NEW NEIGHBOR. YOU GO TO CALL ON THE PEOPLE. YES. AND MRS. MARELLIS, YOU KNOW, SINCE THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, SHE HAS BEEN A VERY LONELY WOMAN. SHE HAS ONLY HER CHICKENS. LET HER HAVE HER CHICKENS. SURE, BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, SHE MIGHT HAVE ONE HEN THAT IS TOO FAT TO LAY ANY MORE EGGS, THAT ONLY EATS AND IS A BURDEN TO HER. SO THAT'S IT. I'D LIKE BETTER TO GO GET SOME CHEESE AND GOAT'S MILK. YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT CHEESE BUSINESS, DANNY. NOW, YOU LISTEN HERE. MRS. MARELLIS MAY BE A LITTLE, YOU KNOW, IN PLACES, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY LIVELY, DANNY, AND VERY FRIENDLY, AND WITH UNSELFISH THOUGHTS. BESIDES, CHICKEN GOES BETTER WITH FISH. ALRIGHT, A CHICKEN. ONE OR TWO? I DON'T KNOW. YOU'LL SEE. [THUNDER] THAT'S A PRETTY BIG RING YOU'VE GOT IN DANNY'S NOSE. WHAT RING? ONE YOU LEAD HIM AROUND WITH. I DO NOT LEAD MY FRIENDS AROUND BY THEIR NOSES, SENOR. I ONLY GIVE THEM MY ADVICE. IF YOU CALL IT ADVICE TO GET HIM TO SELL HIS WATCH AND HIS FURNITURE. TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM LIKE JUST NOW-- [THUNDER] WHO IS A FOOL? I DIDN'T MEAN-- YOU TALK ABOUT MY FRIEND. SPIT THE WORDS BACK FROM YOUR MOUTH. ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. HE IS NOT A FOOL. SAY IT! HE IS NOT A FOOL. THAT'S RIGHT. COME ON, LET'S DRINK SOME WINE.

I WISH YOU OWNED THIS HOUSE, AND I COULD HAVE COME AND LIVED WITH YOU. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] Pilon: THIS IS THE HOUSE, DANNY. Danny: OH. NICE, EH? Pablo: YEAH, BUT $15? HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! WAIT A MINUTE! BOTTLE TOP. I PICKED IT UP YESTERDAY. SOME EVIL MAN MUST HAVE LEFT IT HERE JUST TO DECEIVE PEOPLE. Man: HELLO, BOYS. Pilon: HELLO, FATHER RAMON. Danny: HELLO, FATHER. I WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S PASSING, DANNY. IT WAS A LOSS TO ALL OF US. YES. YES, EVER SINCE IT HAPPENED, FATHER, WE THOUGHT IT'D BE BEST IF WE STAYED WITH DANNY. THAT'S KIND OF YOU. NOW THAT YOU HAVE TWO FINE HOUSES, PERHAPS YOU'LL BE A LITTLE MORE SETTLED. I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU FREQUENT THE CHURCH AS MUCH AS... WELL, AT LEAST AS MUCH AS OTHER PLACES I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT. YOU LISTEN TO FATHER RAMON, DANNY. YOU, PILON, I HAVEN'T HAD A CHAT WITH YOU IN A LONG TIME. LET'S SEE. WHEN WAS IT YOU SENT FOR ME? WAS IT 3 OR 4 YEARS AGO YOU WERE BITTEN BY THAT TARANTULA?

SURE, I-- SAY, DON'T ACT LIKE YOU OWN IT. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE RENT YET. THE RENT! ALWAYS THE RENT. ALWAYS! I HARDLY STICK ONE FOOT INSIDE MY NEW HOUSE, AND YOU'VE GOT BOTH HANDS OUT FOR THE RENT ALREADY. ALREADY HE'S TRYING TO THROW US INTO THE STREETS, INTO THE GUTTERS, WHILE HE SLEEPS IN HIS NICE, SOFT BED. WE SETTLED LAST NIGHT, $15. WHEN PABLO PAYS ME, I PAY YOU. WE SETTLED THAT TOO. ALRIGHT, PABLO. I WANT THE RENT RIGHT NOW. BUT I-- NOW? FOR WHAT? WELL, I...I GOTTA GET THE WATER TURNED ON IN THE OTHER HOUSE. MRS. MARELLIS WILL GIVE YOU PAILS OF WATER. MRS. MARELLIS. THERE ARE OTHER GIRLS AROUND. A MAN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE MONEY FOR A START, MAYBE BUY A PRESENT. YOU KNOW, MAYBE A BOX OF CANDY. WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU-- YOU NEVER GAVE GIRLS CANDY. DANNY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO GO. STOP BOTHERING ME. CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE TALKING BUSINESS? IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME A DOLLAR OR TWO... CHIN KEE'S DRYING SQUIDS DOWN ON THE PIER. WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN AND CUT SQUIDS? CUT SQUIDS? A MAN WITH TWO HOUSES, CUT SQUIDS? THAT MAY BE ALRIGHT FOR YOU OR PABLO, OR MAYBE HIM, BUT NOT FOR A MAN LIKE ME. CUT SQUIDS? NEVER MIND. PAY ME WHEN YOU GET AROUND TO IT. COME ON, TITO. NOT ONE NIGHT. NOT ONE NIGHT WILL I SLEEP IN THIS HOUSE UNTIL I HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THAT LANDLORD HIS DIRTY RENT. HOW'RE WE GONNA GET IT, PILON? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN HE WAS IN JAIL, WE GOT HIM OUT. WHEN HE WAS HUNGRY, WE FED HIM. WHEN IT WAS COLD, GAVE HIM WARM CLOTHES. THAT'S RIGHT. WHEN WAS THAT? WELL, WE WOULD HAVE, IF HE HAD NEEDED THEM. FOR THIS, WE HAVE BEEN HIS FRIENDS. IT SHOWS YOU HOW PROPERTY WILL CHANGE HIM. HEAVEN HAS SENT IT TO HELP US IN OUR TROUBLE. ALL YOURS, EH? HELLO, PILON. WE SLEPT HERE LAST NIGHT. WHAT HAPPENED TO JOSE'S FACE? IT WAS ON ACCOUNT OF THE BOAT. BOAT? WHAT BOAT? I'LL TELL YOU. I WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH YESTERDAY, AND THE WINDS WASHED A NICE LITTLE ROWBOAT ASHORE-- OARS AND EVERYTHING. IT WAS WORTH $20. BUT THE MAN DON'T KNOW THE VALUE OF BOATS, AND HE ONLY GAVE ME 7. THE MAN GAVE YOU $7.00? YEAH. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALRIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE SOLDIERS. THE SOLDIERS, THEY SAID THE BOAT WAS STOLEN? DID THEY TAKE THE MONEY AWAY FROM YOU, TOO? NO. THEY TOOK ARABELLA GROSS FROM HIM. YOU SEE, I BOUGHT A LITTLE WINE, AND THEN I WENT FOR A WALK IN THE WOODS WITH ARABELLA GROSS. FOR HER I BOUGHT FINE WHISKEY AND ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PINK SILK THINGS THAT GOES AROUND HERE. AND THEN THE SOLDIERS PASSED BY. YOU'RE A GOOD FIGHTER, TOO. THERE MUST'VE BEEN 20 OF THEM. NO. THERE WAS ONLY 4. BUT ARABELLA GROSS HELPED THEM! SHE HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A ROCK. IT WAS A GOOD THING PORTAGEE JOE CAME ALONG. SHE BIT MY EAR. THEN I HAD TO KICK HER A LITTLE BIT. YEAH. SO THEN WE WENT AWAY. YOU GOT NO MONEY NOW, HUH? NO. HUH? I DON'T KNOW. YES! HA HA. $3.00 AND A... AND A DIME. HA HA! [COUGHS] LISTEN TO THAT COUGH. THAT IS AWFUL,THAT COUGH. THAT COME FROM SLEEPING IN THE NIGHT AIR. MMM? YOU KNOW, JOSE MARIA, SOMETHING TERRIBLE COULD COME FROM THIS. HERE, YOU COME WITH US. COME WITH US INTO THE HOUSE, WHERE IT IS WARM. WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOME WAY TO PUT A STOP TO THIS. HERE, HERE, SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN AND TAKE THE CHILL OFF YOUR BONES. MY BONES DON'T FEEL CHILLY. AREN'T YOU ASHAMED THAT WE HAVE THIS NICE HOUSE AND POOR JOSE HAS TO SLEEP IN THE COLD? YEAH, PILON, BUT WHAT CAN I DO? LOOK, I RENT THE HOUSE FROM DANNY, NO? YOU RENT THE HOUSE FROM ME, NO? WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU LET POOR JOSE RENT THE HOUSE FROM YOU? WELL, I-- YOU WOULD LIKE THAT, HUH, JOSE? YES. THAT WOULD BE ALRIGHT. BUT IT WILL COST YOU $15 A MONTH. WHAT IS $15 A MONTH? GO ON. WHY DON'T YOU SHAKE HANDS ON IT LIKE TWO GOOD FRIENDS? WHERE IS HE GOING TO GET $15? $3.00 WOULD BE ENOUGH, YOU KNOW, TO START WITH... SURE, I-- NO, WAIT. TONIGHT I PROMISED ARABELLA GROSS I BUY HER SOME MORE PINK SILK THINGS. JOSE. JOSE, YOU... YOU THINK THE GOOD LORD FLOATED THAT LITTLE BOAT TO THE SHORE SO YOU COULD TAKE IT TO MONTEREY AND SELL IT TO BUY PINK SILK THINGS FOR A GIRL WHO HITS YOU IN THE HEAD WITH A ROCK? YOU ARE RIGHT, PILON, AMIGO. HERE, PABLO. THE HOUSE IS YOURS, JOSE MARIA. I THINK I'M GOING TO LIKE IT HERE, HUH, JOE? I THINK WE WILL ALL LIKE IT HERE. NOW YOU CAN PAY THAT DIRTY LANDLORD. DON'T TALK ABOUT DANNY LIKE THAT! DANNY IS OUR FRIEND. WE OWE HIM THIS MONEY. AND HE NEEDS IT. MAYBE TO BUY HIS GIRLFRIEND A LITTLE PRESENT-- A BOX OF CANDY, MAYBE. YEAH, BUT YOU SAID YOURSELF HE'S "DIRTY LAND"-- SHUT UP! I THINK MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO DANNY. MAYBE HE SHOULD BUY WINE INSTEAD OF CANDY. CANDY IS BAD FOR THE TEETH. WINE MAKES A NICE PRESENT FOR A LADY. AND I THINK MAYBE SO DANNY DOESN'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE, I-- I THINK WE SHOULD BUY THE WINE FOR HIM. JOE! JOE, COME ON. WE'RE GOING TO BUY SOME WINE. [GUITAR PLAYING CIELITO LINDO] HEY! [SNORING] HA HA HA! I BET YOU'RE FALLING DOWN FROM SURPRISE, EH? MAYBE YES, MAYBE NO. WANT TO COME IN? HA HA HA! HA HA HA! MR. BROWN, MR... UH, ALVAREZ, ISN'T IT?

I'LL TELL HER YOU HAD TO GO BACK TO THE STORE. WELL, I...I DO HAVE TO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING. GOODNIGHT. YEAH. SEE YOU IN THE FRUIT DEPARTMENT. WHERE'S HE GOING? HE HAD TO GO BACK.

I GOT A JOB HERE IN THE SARDINE CANNERY. 70 CENTS AN HOUR STARTING TOMORROW. WORK. ALL THE TIME, WORK. WHAT DOES A GIRL WITH A FACE LIKE PEACHES WANT TO WORK FOR? I'VE GOT A FACE LIKE PEACHES? YOU GOT MORE THAN THAT, YOU-- NO, I HAVEN'T, BUT I'M GOING TO GET WHAT I CAN. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET, SWEETS? WHAT A GIRL WITH ANY SENSE OUGHT TO GET. A HOME WITH EVERYTHING IN IT...AND KIDS. KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE TO PICK BEANS, EITHER. YOU'VE GOT TO GET A MAN FIRST, SWEETS. SURE, A HUSBAND. A HUSBAND I'M CRAZY ABOUT. YOU SEEN HIM YET? NO. YOU WANT TOO MUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT? A MAN WITH TWO HOUSES, WHAT DOES HE NEED? HE CANNOT KISS A HOUSE. YOU JUST STOOD IN FRONT OF THEM ALL DAY AND FELT BIG. NO. I WENT BACK TO JAIL TO FINISH MY 10 DAYS. WERE YOU IN JAIL? SURE. I GOT SOME BAD WINE. A COP HIT ME, I HIT HIM BACK. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB? DID YOU LOSE YOUR JOB? WHAT JOB? YOU MEAN YOU DON'T WORK ANYWHERE? WORK? ME, I GOT NO TIME TO WORK. BESIDES, I RENT MY SMALL HOUSE TO PILON. $15.00 A MONTH. YOU SEE? ALL AT ONCE I HAVE MY HOUSES, MY RENT-- Man: DANNY! DANNY! [POUNDING ON DOOR] DANNY! DANNY! ARE YOU HERE? WHAT'S THE MATTER? HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE. WHICH ONE? THE ONE PILON IS RENTING. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? I DON'T KNOW. HONEST, I DON'T. A BURNING SHINGLE FELL ON ME. ARE THE FIRE ENGINES THERE? SURE. BUT PILON SAID-- WHAT CAN I DO IF THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? DANNY! YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOUR HOUSE? IT'S ON FIRE. WHAT DO I CARE? I GOT ANOTHER HOUSE. NO. SWEETS, YOU-- YOU GET OUT OF HERE. YOU CRAZY, SWEETS? YOU GET OUT. WHAT'S THIS? THIS MORNING YOU GAVE ME THE SMILE. YOU KISS ME BACK-- YOU'RE NO GOOD, MR. ALVAREZ, COMING IN MY HOUSE AND GRABBING ME LIKE THAT. YOU'RE NOTHING, BUT A NO-GOOD PAISANO, A JAILBIRD LIKE ALL YOUR FRIENDS. YOU TOLD ME, LIKE YOU WERE PROUD OF IT. YOU'D BETTER STAY AWAY FROM ME UNTIL YOU CHANGE YOUR IDEAS, MR. ALVAREZ! NO-GOOD, HUH? WE'LL SEE. OH, YES? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CUT ME. I'LL CUT YOU TO PIECES. EHH...GO BACK TO SALINAS. [GOAT BLEATS] Danny: BAAA! Pablo: WHOO! Pilon: DID YOU FIND DANNY? SURE, SURE. I TOLD HIM. WAS HE MAD? I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS BUSY. HE WAS WITH ONE OF SALINAS' GIRLS. SALINAS GIRLS, HUH? AMIGOS, WE FORGOT THE WINE. THERE WAS TWO INCHES LEFT IN ONE JUG. AW, IT WAS DANNY'S WINE. LET IT BURN UP WITH THE HOUSE AND BE A PUNISHMENT ON US. Man: WATCH YOURSELF. SONNY, BACK UP! [BABY CRYING] WHY DO YOU BRING A BABY TO A FIRE? WE WERE ASLEEP IN THE WOODS, AND THE WHISTLES BLEW. AND THE PEOPLE CAME, AND I CAME OUT TO SEE. WHOSE BABY IS THAT? MINE. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? I WALK FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO. Jose: THAT'S 100 MILES FROM HERE. WHERE'RE YOU GOING? TO SANTA CRUZ, SENOR. I'M TAKING THE BABY TO MY MOTHER. HE'S SICK, I THINK. HE'S SICK, I THINK, FROM SLEEPING IN THE WOODS TOO MUCH. I DON'T KNOW, SENOR. HE'S JUST SICK. [WATER POWER INCREASES] THAT'S ALL. LET'S GO. YOU BETTER COME, TOO. Pablo: WHERE ARE WE GOING? TO DANNY'S. WHAT? MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE SLEPT IN THE WOODS TONIGHT AND STAYED AWAY FROM DANNY FOR A WHILE. OR GO TO ANOTHER TOWN FOR A WHILE. WATSONVILLE? YEAH, CASTROVILLE. NO. THEY ARE TOO FAR AWAY. NO, NO. WE WILL CONFESS OUR SINS TO DANNY LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN TO A GOOD FATHER. AND IF HE GETS MAD AT US, HE WILL BE SORRY LATER ON. [KNOCK ON DOOR] HOW DID THE FIRE START? WE DON'T KNOW. PERHAPS WE HAVE ENEMIES, DANNY. WE ARE VERY SORRY. WELL, CLOSE THE DOOR. IT'S COLD ENOUGH IN HERE. AND REMEMBER ONE THING. EVERYBODY STAYS OUT OF MY BED. [BABY CRIES] WHO'S THAT? THIS IS A YOUNG FATHER ON HIS WAY TO SANTA CRUZ, DANNY. HIS BABY IS TOO SICK TO SLEEP IN THE WOODS. OH... MAYBE WE SHOULD GET A DOCTOR. OH, NO, NO. WHAT GOOD ARE DOCTORS? THEY DON'T-- HERE, GIVE HIM TO ME. HERE. [BABY STOPS CRYING] HEH! HE IS SO LITTLE. I'M SURE HE CAN ONLY HAVE A LITTLE SICKNESS, HUH? WHERE'S YOUR WIFE? IN SAN LUIS OBISPO, SENOR. SHE--SHE DIED OF INFLUENZA. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HE'S GOT. NO. I THINK IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS NOT HAD ANYTHING TO EAT SINCE THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. NOTHING TO EAT SINCE DAY BEFORE-- WHY, THE BABY IS STARVING! THE BABY NEEDS FOOD QUICK! THERE IS SOME MACKEREL LEFT FROM LAST NIGHT. MACKEREL? SHUT UP! THE BABY NEEDS MILK-- GOOD MILK, LOTS OF IT. THAT SALINAS GIRL. GO ASK HER. SHE HAS GOATS. WHAT IF SHE HAS? GOAT'S MILK IS NO GOOD FOR BABIES. GOAT'S MILK IS THE BEST FOR BABIES. GO GET IT! ALRIGHT. I'LL GET IT. THIS BABY NEEDS A BED, TOO. JOSE, GO GET THE APPLE BOX FROM THE BACK. PUT SOME DRY WEEDS. JOE, JOE, GET THE BLANKET OFF DANNY'S BED. MACKEREL. DID YOUR MOTHER FEED MACKEREL THROUGH A NIPPLE? I THINK SO. JUST REMEMBER, MR. ALVAREZ, IF THERE'S NO SICK BABY-- WHAT ELSE WOULD I CALL YOU FOR? REMEMBER, I'VE GOT NAILS AS SHARP AS SCISSORS, THAT'S ALL. YEAH, YEAH. YOUNG AMIGO, YOU'LL GROW UP TO BE A FIREMAN. POOR BABY. STOP THAT SILLY CLINKING! NOW, GET A PAN TO HEAT THE MILK IN. WHO THOUGHT OF THIS MESS? YOU WANT THIS BABY EATEN UP BY MOTHS AND GROUND FLEAS? GET A PILLOW FROM THE BED IN THERE AND BEAT THE DUST OUT OF IT. NOW, DON'T STAND THERE LOOKING STUPID. PUT THAT MILK IN THE PAN AND WARM IT. NOT BOILING, NOW. [SOFTLY] THAT'S IT. WHY DO YOU BRING HER, SCREAMING LIKE A SEA GULL? I DIDN'T. I ONLY ASKED HER FOR SOME MILK! HEY, SHE'S SMART, THAT GIRL, ISN'T SHE? SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT-- SHUT UP! OHHH! [ROCKER SQUEAKING] I THINK MAYBE YOU FEED HIM TOO MUCH. HE AND I KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. YOU'VE GOT A NICE HOUSE HERE, MR. ALVAREZ. OH, YEAH. YOU LIKE IT, HUH? NOT THE WAY IT IS, BUT IT COULD BE FIXED UP PRETTY. THIS HOUSE IS A GIFT TO DANNY FROM HIS GRANDFATHER. IT IS TOO BAD THAT WE MUST RATTLE THE STONES OF COMPLAINT OVER A MAN'S GRAVE. MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE. OH, I GUESS WHEN HIS GRANDFATHER HAD IT, IT WAS FIXED UP NICE-- CURTAINS AND RUGS, AND ALL THE CHAIRS CLEANED AND PATCHED. MAYBE HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS WITH HIM THEN, AND SHE TENDED TO EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. I'LL BET IF YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS ALIVE, SHE WOULD CLEAN UP AROUND HERE, ALRIGHT-- DUST AND SWEEP AND THROW OUT A LOT OF THINGS. THROW OUT WHAT THINGS? WHAT'RE YOU-- SHH! HE'S ASLEEP. YOU COME BY MY HOUSE IN THE MORNING AND GET SOME MILK IN A BOTTLE, AND TAKE THE BUS TO SANTA CRUZ. HERE. OH, GRACIAS, SENORITA. WELL, THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT WITH ME. HERE'S 12 CENTS. I GOT A DIME. AND HE CAN HAVE JOE'S KNIFE. HERE. HERE'S TWO BITS. OH, SURE, SURE, LEFT OVER FROM JOSE MARIA'S RENT PAYMENT. I CANNOT TALK, SUCH FRIENDS. WELL, YOU BETTER KEEP IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW. YOU MIGHT LOSE IT. GOODNIGHT. GOODNIGHT! SAY, SHE LEFT HER PITCHER HERE. I DO NOT LIKE THAT GIRL. WHY? SHE IS DANGEROUS. I DON'T LIKE THE WAY SHE TALKS. AHH! RUGS AND CLEANING, CURTAINS AND PATCHING! ERR... ALL WITH A BABY IN HER ARMS. THAT IS NO GOOD. SHE TALKS LIKE CORNELIA RUIZ. YOU REMEMBER WHAT CORNELIA RUIZ DID TO JOHNNY POM-POM? 3 YEARS AGO, SHE WAS SEWING BUTTONS ON HIS SHIRT. NOW THEY HAVE 4 CHILDREN. YEAH. I SAW JOHNNY POM-POM LAST WEEK. HE'S DIGGING IN A SEWER FOR A GAS COMPANY 8 HOURS A DAY, AND CORNELIA RUIZ SITS AROUND THEIR HOUSE AND GETS FAT IN THE MIDDLE. SHE IS ALSO LIKE GRACIE MONTEZ. GRACIE FOUND OUT THAT PEDRO HAVANAS WOULD DO ANYTHING WHEN HE HAD TOO MUCH WINE. DO YOU REMEMBER PEDRO HAVANAS? HE IS NOW A JANITOR IN THE SALA TOPEKA HOTEL. MMM...MMM... WOMEN LIKE THAT CRAWL AROUND AFTER THEIR HUSBANDS LIKE A CAT AFTER QUAIL. THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS. LISTEN! YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT WOMEN! WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, EH? [CROWS] YOU KNOW, I THINK IF-- SHH! [SNAP] BAAWWK! [ROOSTER CACKLING] THAT WAS OUR BIGGEST ROOSTER. MAYBE IF WE GOT A PILE OF FEATHERS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A HEN ON THIS SIDE... MAYBE... Pablo: YOU KNOW, AMIGOS, IF ALL THE DEW WERE DIAMONDS, WE'D BE VERY RICH. WE COULD HAVE CHICKENS AND WINE ALL OUR LIVES. THEN THERE WOULD BE SO MANY DIAMONDS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PRICE FOR THEM. I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. CHICKENS AND WINE, THEY ALWAYS COST MONEY. NOW, IF IT WOULD RAIN WINE FOR A LITTLE WHILE, AND HAD A BIG TANK TO CATCH IT... Pablo: THAT WOULD BE BETTER. Pilon: YES, YES. YOU GAVE THAT BOY ALL THE MACKEREL, HUH? SURE. YEAH, BUT I SAID TO PILON YESTERDAY, I SAID, "IF YOU HAVE A PELICAN--" SHUT UP. Mrs. Marellis: GOOD MORNING, BOYS. Pilon: GOOD MORNING, MRS. MARELLIS. GOOD MORNING, DANNY. [PLAYING GUITAR] DO YOU NEED ANY MORE WATER THIS MORNING? NO. DON'T BE STRANGERS, DANNY. [CHICKENS CACKLING] WHAT A NICE NEIGHBOR SHE IS. IT IS TOO BAD THAT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ONE'S FRIENDS YOU COULD NOT-- NO! [SIGHS] GOOD MORNING, DANNY. YOU WANT SOME WOOD FOR YOUR NEW HOUSE? 25 CENTS. I HAVEN'T GOT IT, PIRATE. PIRATE! WHAT KIND OF A DOG IS THAT YELLOW ONE? OH, THIS-- THIS IS ENRIQUE. HE'S A GOOD BOY. I THINK HE'S A HUNTING DOG. THIS IS SENOR ALEX THOMPSON. HE'S A KIND OF AIREDALE. AND THIS? THIS IS MY LITTLE PAJARITO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS. BUT HE LIKES TO PLAY WITH A BALL. AND HIS NAME IS FLUFF. THAT'S A GENUINE PUG DOG. HE SLEEPS A LOT. THIS IS RUDOLPH. HA HA! RUDOLPH, HE'S A, WELL... I THINK YOU JUST CALL HIM AMERICAN DOG, HUH? HA HA! ALL BOYS. GOOD BOYS. EH? SAY GOODBYE, BOYS. BYE. COME, BOYS. UHHH... YOU KNOW, I THINK THE PIRATE IS A VERY RICH MAN. HE IS CRAZY. HE LIVES IN A CHICKEN HOUSE WITH ALL THOSE DOGS. EVERY DAY HE PICKS UP WOOD, AND HE SELLS IT FOR 25 CENTS. AND YET HE BEGS FOR HIS FOOD AND CLOTHES. NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN HIM SPEND ONE PENNY--NOT ONE PENNY! AND YET, FOR 3 YEARS, EVERY DAY, 25 CENTS. HOW MUCH DOES THAT AMOUNT TO? SO MUCH YOU CANNOT EVEN FIGURE IT OUT. YEAH. MAKES YOUR HEAD ACHE. IF HE DOES NOT SPEND IT, HE MUST HAVE IT SOMEWHERE. AND WHENEVER HE GETS DIMES AND NICKELS, HE CHANGES IT TO TWO BITSES. WHY IS THIS? IT IS EASIER TO CARRY, MAYBE. HE CANNOT CARRY ALL THAT. HE MUST HIDE IT SOMEPLACE. NOW YOU TALK, AMIGO. HIS POOR BRAIN IS NO GOOD, SO HE HIDES HIS MONEY. Jose: THAT'S NO GOOD. Pilon: NO. IF HAD SOME FRIENDS, NOW, WHO COULD SHOW HIM HOW TO USE HIS MONEY-- GET HIM SOME WARM CLOTHING AND SOME GOOD FOOD, MAYBE FIND HIM A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE... YOU WOULDN'T TAKE ANYTHING FROM HIM, WOULD YOU? HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF CHARITY? TO HELP OTHERS IS THE HIGHEST THING A MAN CAN DO. POOR OLD PIRATE. OH... WHERE ARE YOU GOING, AMIGO? OH, JUST TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND. POOR DANNY. SINCE HE HAS THIS HOUSE, HE LOOKS WORRIED ALL THE TIME. HE DOES NOT LAUGH ANYMORE. HIS MIND IS NOT AT PEACE. WE MUST DO SOMETHING FOR HIM. Woman: NOBODY HOME. WHERE DID SHE GO? SHE STARTED WORK THIS MORNING. OCEAN SEAL CANNERY. OH, YEAH. I'LL GIVE IT TO HER WHEN SHE COMES BACK. Boy: MA! FRANCITO, YOU LET THE MAN DO WHAT HE'S-- HE'S ALRIGHT. WHAT'S HE DOING? FROM THE DOCTOR OF HEALTH BOARD. HI. HELLO. YOU GIVE ME A LIFT INTO TOWN? SURELY. YOU GET PLENTY TO EAT, SON? Boy: SURE! WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST? TORTILLAS AND BEANS. GO TO SCHOOL? SURE. ONE "B." WHAT, DO YOU TAKE YOUR LUNCH WITH YOU? SURE. WHAT DO YOU TAKE? SOME BEANS WRAPPED UP IN A TORTILLA. WELL, AT NIGHT, FOR SUPPER, WHAT DO YOU EAT THEN? TORTILLAS AND BEANS. IS THAT ALL YOU EAT, TORTILLAS AND BEANS? SURE. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? IT'S AMAZING. GOODBYE. Woman: GOODBYE, DOCTOR. THANK YOU. COME ON. PIERRE, GET OFF OF THERE, GET OFF! KIDS, JOHNNY, COME BACK! MAY I SEE YOUR TEETH? SURE! I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. A STEADY DIET OF BEANS IS SLOW POISON. MY GRANDFATHER SAID, "THE THING YOU WERE USED TO, THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU." HE WAS BORN ON A CATTLE RANCH, BUT HE ONLY ATE BULL MEAT. HE SAID COW MEAT MADE YOU WEAK. IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR WOMEN. HA HA! [DOGS BARKING] HERE, HERE, BOO, DOGS! SENOR THOMPSON, THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK TO PEOPLE. OH, PILON, YOU WANT SOME WOOD? NO, I DO NOT WANT WOOD, AMIGO. OH, WELL, COME IN, PILON. COME IN. IT IS SMALL, NOT FIT FOR VISITORS, BUT IT IS WARM AND SNUG, AND MY BOYS LIKE IT. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN, PILON? I BROUGHT YOU A SUGAR COOKIE. OH, A COOKIE, FOR ME? HA HA! LOOK, BOYS! PILON HAS BROUGHT US A SUGAR COOKIE! SUSIE FRANCISCO BORROWED IT FOR ME. SHE WORKS IN THE BAKERY. OH... FIRST, OUR GUEST... THEN US. THAT'S ALL. NO MORE. PIRATE, AMIGO, WHY DO YOU ALLOW YOUR FRIENDS TO WORRY ABOUT YOU SO MUCH? MY FRIENDS? YES. THEY WOULD LIKE TO COME AND VISIT YOU, YOU KNOW, BUT THEY ARE AFRAID IF THEY COME HERE AND SEE YOU LIVING LIKE THIS, THAT YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED. DANNY, JOSE MARIA, PABLO--THEY ARE ALL MY FRIENDS? OH, YES, YES, PIRATE. THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS, AND THEY WORRY ABOUT YOU. THEY ARE AFRAID YOU WILL GET SICK AND DIE IN HERE. OH. BUT, YOU SEE, PILON, MY BOYS LIKE IT HERE. AND I LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT. I DID NOT KNOW I HAD FRIENDS WHO WORRIED. YES, YES. AND YOU SHOULD NOT LET THEM DO IT, AMIGO. BUT I... YOU MUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO, PILON. YOU ARE MY FRIEND. WE HAVE A HOUSE. IT SHALL BE YOUR HOUSE. WHY DON'T YOU COME AND LIVE WITH US? I...COME AND LIVE WITH YOU? YES. IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN STOP BEING SAD ABOUT YOU. AND MY BOYS, TOO? YES, YES, OH, YES. DANNY LOVES DOGS. OH... PLEASE... GO AWAY NOW, PILON. MY FRIEND, I CANNOT SPEAK ANYMORE. I WILL TALK IT OVER WITH MY BOYS. AND TONIGHT, MAYBE, WE WILL COME TO YOUR HOUSE. GOODBYE, AMIGO. [CANS CLINKING] OH, THANKS. HEY! WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW? YOU LEFT YOUR PITCHER AT MY HOUSE. I KNOW. I'LL COME BY AND GET IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. I GAVE IT TO MRS. TERESINA. ALRIGHT. THANKS! OH, FOR-- SEE WHAT YOU DID? WELL, I JUST CAME DOWN TO TELL YOU, THAT'S ALL. ALRIGHT. NOW YOU TOLD ME. SURE, I TOLD YOU! ALRIGHT, SO I HEARD YOU! SURE, YOU HEARD ME! COME ON, GET OUT OF HERE, WILL YOU? HE'S GOING, MR. WILLOUGHBY. WATCH YOUR LINE. GET BACK TO-- Man: HEY, PAISANO! I NEED ANOTHER MAN. YOU WANT A JOB? 5 BUCKS... HOW LONG IS THE JOB? OH, 8 OR 10 HOURS. NAH, I'M BUSY. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU-- WELL, THERE. YOU WANT IT? A SWEEPING MACHINE! OH, WHAT A PRESENT. NOBODY IN TORTILLA FLAT HAS A THING LIKE THAT. WELL, GOODNIGHT, DANNY. GOODNIGHT, DOLORES. AN OLD LADY HAS NO BUSINESS TO BE AROUND AT A TIME LIKE THIS. [LAUGHS] WHERE DID YOU GET IT? IT COST A LOT. I GOT IT. DO YOU WANT IT? YOU DIDN'T STEAL IT, DID YOU? YOU DIDN'T-- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I BOUGHT IT. WHERE DID YOU GET THE MONEY? I WORKED FOR IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WORKED FOR IT? DANNY, YOU MEAN YOU GOT A JOB FOR ME? COME HERE. [WHISTLING] [LAUGHING] [DOG BARKS] HEY! HEY! GET DOWN! WHAT IS THIS? Pirate: HERE, BOYS! THIS IS DANNY. DANNY HAS ASKED US TO COME AND LIVE IN HIS HOUSE. AMIGO, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WE HAVE A GREAT SURPRISE FOR YOU. THE PIRATE HAS AGREED TO COME AND LIVE WITH US. YES, BUT WHERE WILL HE-- SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN, AMIGO. THE PIRATE HAS BEEN TELLING US SOME FINE STORIES. YES, BUT WHERE WILL HE-- HERE, HAVE SOME WINE. MAYBE THE PIRATE WOULD TELL US SOME MORE STORIES ABOUT THE DOGS. DO THEY ALL LIKE TO GO IN THE WOODS AND HUNT FOR ANIMALS AND DIG UP THINGS OUT OF THE GROUND? OH, YES! SENOR ALEC THOMPSON HERE, HE DIGS ALL THE TIME. MAYBE HE WILL FIND TREASURE SOMEDAY. YOU KNOW, PILON, RICH PEOPLE, THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR MONEY IN THE WOODS. Pilon: OH, I KNOW. I KNOW. AND THAT IS NO GOOD, YOU KNOW. PEOPLE LOSE THEIR MONEY THAT WAY. Jose: IT IS FOOLISH TO HIDE MONEY. I HAD AN UNCLE ONCE, AN OLD MISER. HE USED TO HIDE HIS GOLD IN THE WOODS, TOO. SOME THIEF FOUND IT AND STOLE IT. MY UNCLE IS A POOR OLD MAN NOW, WITH ALL HIS MONEY GONE. SO HE HANGED HIMSELF. I WAS THERE WHEN THEY FOUND HIM. HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS LISTENING TO THE BIRDS. WELL, THERE-- THERE'S NO TREASURE IN THESE WOODS. PEOPLE WHO HIDE THEIR MONEY. I REMEMBER MY COUSIN. MY COUSIN WAS A VERY SMART MAN, TOO. IF ANYBODY IN THE WORLD WOULD KNOW HOW TO HIDE THEIR MONEY SO NO ONE WOULD FIND IT, IT WOULD BE MY COUSIN. MAYBE YOU KNOW MY COUSIN. HE'S THE LITTLE ONE WHO CRAWLS AROUND ON THE WHARF BEGGING FOR FISH HEADS TO MAKE SOUP. THAT IS MY COUSIN. HE HID HIS MONEY. ME, I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR PEOPLE WHO HIDE THEIR MONEY. OH, NO, NO. THAT IS THEIR OWN PUNISHMENT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY SHOULD MAKE USE OF IT FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THEMSELVES AND OF THEIR FRIENDS. ANYBODY WHO HIDES HIS MONEY MIGHT JUST AS WELL HANG HIMSELF LIKE YOUR UNCLE, BECAUSE MY COUSIN GETS ALL THE FISH HEADS. BUT I--I HAVE NOT ANY MONEY. OH, NOT YOU, AMIGO. WE WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU. THIS IS A LITTLE STORY WE TELL HERE IN THIS HOUSE EACH NIGHT BEFORE WE GO TO BED. NOW WE GO TO BED. YOU SLEEP HERE, PIRATE. IT'S WARM IN HERE. [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] Danny: DO YOU THINK HE'S GOT A LOT OF MONEY, EH? HE ACTS LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY. HE IS AFRAID. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE IS AFRAID, I THINK HE WILL DIG IT UP SOON. I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD BE THERE WHEN HE DIGS IT UP, WE CAN HELP HIM OVERCOME HIS FEAR. LOOK, IF WE DO, DO YOU THINK I COULD BORROW $210 FROM HIM? WHY DO YOU WANT $210? HERMAN SCRAVANI'S BOAT. IT'S FOR SALE. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL EVENING, AMIGO? WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT? DO YOU THINK I CAN GET THE MONEY, OR NO? YOU'RE MY FRIEND! WAIT A MINUTE. I DID NOT SAY YOU COULD NOT. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO KNOW. THANKS, PILON. [DOOR CLOSES] [DOG WHIMPERS] [SNORING] SHH. [WHISPERING] Come on. Let's go. You must not follow too close. The dogs will hear us. [HOO HOO] OW. That is a fine place to look. PILON, I DID NOT-- Shut up. However, I think he went over there. Danny: No, no. More to the left. You 3 go that way. I will take this one. We will go over here. Be quiet. Be quiet! Pilon: Shh! [MOO MOO] WHO WAS THAT? Pilon: WHAT ARE YOU ALL SITTING AROUND HERE FOR? WE CAN'T FIND HIM. JOE'S FEET HURT. YEAH. HEY, WHAT SMELLS AROUND HERE? HIM. AMIGOS, I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP, HONEST, I WAS. I THOUGHT I SAW ONE OF HIS DOGS. A DOG WITH A WHITE STRIPE DOWN ITS BACK. COME ON. YOU STAY IN BACK OF THE WIND. IN BACK OF THE WIND. ALL NIGHT. WHEN WE COULD HAVE BEEN ASLEEP. WE MUST FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO FOLLOW HIM. YEAH. Pablo: WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. OH, GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, MY FRIENDS. I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU. I WENT OUT INTO THE WOODS LAST NIGHT. ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT LATER. PHEW. I AM GOING TO GO TO SLEEP. AND I DON'T WANT-- OH, PILON. I LIED TO YOU LAST NIGHT. I SAID I HAD NO MONEY BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID. BUT I WAS MORE AFRAID WHEN I HEARD YOU TELL HOW HIDDEN MONEY CAN BE STOLEN, SO I WENT INTO THE WOODS, AND I BROUGHT IT BACK HERE. GOOD! GOOD, HUH? YOU--YOU HAVE MONEY. YEAH. YES. IT WAS RIGHT YOU SHOULD BRING IT HERE. OH, YES. IT CAME TO ME ALL AT ONCE LIKE A WONDERFUL LIGHT. YOU ARE MY FRIENDS, MY ONLY FRIENDS. NO ONE CAN STEAL MY MONEY IF MY FRIENDS WATCH IT FOR ME. YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS, BUT LAST NIGHT IN THE WOODS, SOME PEOPLE FOLLOWED ME TO STEAL MY MONEY. I--I HEARD THEM. OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, MY FRIENDS, KEEP IT FOR ME. IT WILL MAKE ME VERY HAPPY. UH, MAYBE, MAYBE YOU, UH, YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE OUT JUST A FEW TWO BITSES BEFORE-- OH, NO, NO. I CANNOT DO THAT. THE MONEY IS PROMISED. PROMISED? TO WHO? TO SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI. SAINT FRANCIS. YES. THE GOOD SAINT OF ANIMALS. YES! THERE IS ALMOST 1,000 TWO BITSES IN THIS BAG. WHEN I HAVE 1,000, I MUST BUY A GOLD CANDLESTICK FOR SAINT FRANCIS. WHY? WELL, I ONCE HAD A NICE DOG. HE WAS A VERY SICK BOY. AND I PRAYED, AND I PROMISED A GOLD CANDLESTICK OF 1,000 DAYS IF HE WOULD GET WELL. AND THAT DOG GOT WELL! WHICH DOG WAS THAT? OH, NO. NOT ONE OF THESE. ANOTHER ONE. A LITTLE LATER, A TRUCK RAN OVER HIM. WE WILL KEEP THIS MONEY. THERE. THE MONEY WILL BE SAFE THERE. OH. AND TO THINK OF ALL THE YEARS THAT I WORRIED. NOW NOTHING CAN HAPPEN TO THE MONEY OF SAINT FRANCIS BECAUSE I HAVE MY FRIENDS. SQUEEZES VERY HARD INSIDE OF ME. ARE YOU SURE? YOU DON'T SEE? I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. ALRIGHT. PETER ROMANO TOLD ME HE'S BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS. AH! THERE HE IS. WORKING. POOR DANNY. HE'S WORKING. HUH, I TOLD YOU. LOOK. LOOK, LOOK! HE'S SWEATING. Man: OK. PULL HER OUT! IT'S THAT PORTAGEE GIRL. WE MUST DO SOMETHING. SHE MAKES HIM DO THAT? EVERYBODY KNOWS HE GAVE HER THAT SWEEPING MACHINE. AH, THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. DON'T YOU SEE THE WAY HER NOSE IS POINTED? BEFORE LONG, SHE WILL BE IN OUR--IN DANNY'S HOUSE. SHE WILL WANT TO MAKE SOME CHANGES, YOU REMEMBER? SHE'D WANT TO BE ALONE THERE WITH DANNY, WOULDN'T SHE? WE CAN'T LET HER DO THIS TO HIM. THAT'S THE TROUBLE WHEN PROPERTY COMES. SHH! THERE HE IS. LET ME TRY TO HELP HIM. WORKING, HUH, AMIGO? OH. HELLO, PILON. I, UH, THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD USE SOME MONEY, YOU KNOW? UH-HUH. YES. TO BUY A BOAT OR SOME ELECTRIC WIRES FOR THE SWEEPING MACHINE? WHAT WIRES? WELL, EVERYBODY IN TORTILLA FLAT IS TALKING ABOUT IT. THEY KNOW YOU BOUGHT THE LADY A SWEEPING MACHINE, THEY ALSO KNOW SHE HAS NO WIRES IN HER HOUSE TO MAKE IT GO. IT IS A VERY FUNNY PRESENT. SHE LIKED IT! OF COURSE SHE LIKED IT. SHE SAYS YOU PROMISED TO PUT WIRES IN THE HOUSE, TOO. DID SHE SAY THAT? WHY, SHE HAS TOLD EVERYBODY. IF I--IF I DID NOT THINK IT WAS SO FUNNY, I--I WOULD BE ANGRY THAT EVERYBODY IS LAUGHING AT MY FRIEND. WHO IS LAUGHING? EVERYBODY IS LAUGHING. MRS. MARELLIS, TORRELLI, YES, AND THEY SAY THAT ARABELLA GROSS-- WHEN SHE DRINKS WHISKEY, SHE SINGS A SONG ABOUT IT. 8 PARTS. I DO NOT THINK IT WAS VERY NICE OF THE LADY TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT THE MAN SHE IS GOING TO MARRY. WHO SAID I WAS GOING TO MARRY HER? YOU SAID NOTHING ABOUT MARRIAGE? WHY, SHE HAS TOLD EVERYONE! I NEVER SAID A WORD! I WAS WAITING, WELL, TILL I-- Man: HEY, DANNY! SNAP IT UP THERE! I--I GOT TO GO NOW. HELLO, PILON. YOUR HUSBAND IS HERE? NO. OH, PILON. YOU BRING ME A ROSEBUSH? A ROSE FOR YOU. AND FOR THIS, TWO GALLONS. OH, A SWEEPING MACHINE. ISN'T THIS THE ONE DANNY GAVE THE RAMIREZ GIRL? YES, YES, YES. BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE IS A BAD ONE. OH, HE HAD TO TAKE IT BACK. THEY HAD A FIGHT. AH, THERE ARE NOT MANY WOMEN LIKE YOU, MY LITTLE CORN CAKE. HA HA HA! THE WINE IS IN THE CELLAR. MAYBE YOU'LL HELP ME CARRY UP TWO GALLONS, NO? SURE! SURE. MAYBE I'LL HELP YOU CARRY UP 3 GALLONS. HA HA HA! [KNOCK ON DOOR] WHAT DO YOU WANT TO COME AROUND HERE FOR? WHAT DO I WANT TO COME AROUND HERE FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE?. BECAUSE YOU'RE A THIEF! YOU COME AND TAKE IT WHILE MY BACK'S TURNED? TAKE WHAT? WHAT ARE-- YOU GIVE LIKE INDIANS, DON'T YOU? WHO'S AN INDIAN-- YOU GIVE ME A PRESENT. I OPEN MY HEART, MY HEART, TO YOU. AND WHEN I MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF, YOU COME AND TAKE IT BACK AGAIN AND LET EVERYBODY KNOW ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE-- I SUPPOSE YOU DIDN'T TRADE THE VACUUM CLEANER TO THAT TORRELLI COW FOR SOME OF HER DIRTY WINE, LET HER MOUTH BABBLE IT FROM DOOR TO DOOR. I SUPPOSE JUST AN HOUR AGO, YOUR NO-GOOD FRIEND PILON DIDN'T COME BY AND LAUGH AT ME ABOUT IT. I HATE HIM! THE-- NEVER MIND PILON. NEVER MIND ANYTHING. I NEVER ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME, DID I? NOW DID I? ME MARRY YOU? WHAT DID YOU GO SPREADING THAT ALL AROUND FOR? SINCE DO YOU GOT THE RIGHT TO GO YAPPING-- LISTEN, MR. ALVAREZ, I DID NO SUCH THING! BUT I FOUND YOU OUT NOW. I WOULDN'T MARRY YOU IF--IF YOU WERE THE GOVERNOR IN GOLD PANTS! YOU WOULDN'T? LIKE THEY ALL SAY, YOU'D MARRY ANYBODY THAT HAD TWO DIMES AND A DEAD GOAT. GET OUT OF HERE. GET OUT!

AND HE SAID, "BE GOOD TO LITTLE DOGS, YOU DIRTY MAN." HE CALLED YOU THAT? WELL, I WAS. AND SAINTS, THEY NEVER LIE, YOU KNOW. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY OTHER VISIONS, MAYBE? OH, NO. NO. I WOULD BE AFRAID TO SEE ANOTHER ONE. UH, WELL, NOW, NOW WE MUST GET HIM DRESSED, HUH? WHERE ARE THE CLOTHES YOU BOUGHT? OH, YES. IS THIS ALL YOU GOT? YES. WELL, YOU CAN'T GO TO CHURCH IN THOSE CLOTHES! HE CAN HAVE MY COAT. I HAVE ANOTHER SHIRT. I CAN-- YOU CAN HAVE MY HAT, BUT LOOK AT YOUR PANTS. YOU GOT NO PANTS. THEY'RE-- JOE. JOE! HEY, NO. YOUR PANTS WILL JUST FIT THE PIRATE. YES, JOE. THERE. NO, NO, NO. ON THE INSIDE, IT WILL GO. OH, BUT IT IS SO PRETTY. YES, I KNOW, BUT NOT FOR CHURCH. YOU WEAR IT ON THE INSIDE AND LEAVE YOUR COAT OPEN, AND THEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT A LITTLE. [CLANKING] [LAUGHTER] YAH! YAH! HEY, LOOK AT ALL THE RATS! PILON! PILON IS A RAT! A SON OF A RAT AND A CRACKPOT! COME BACK TO YOUR HOUSE! YOU HAD PLENTY OF FUN FOR THIS TIME. DO YOU THINK I'D COME BACK TO A RAT'S NEST? GET BACK IN YOUR HOLES! GET BACK! HA HA HA! YOU MUST DO SOMETHING, PILON. HE'S BEEN THIS WAY 5 DAYS NOW. HE THREW A BEER BOTTLE IN TORRELLI'S WINDOW AND HIT TORRELLI IN THE NECK, YOU KNOW? COME ON, AMIGO. BUT DOES NOT DANNY KNOW THAT JOE SHOWED US WHERE THE MONEY WAS? IF THIS IS WHAT IS TROUBLING HIM, WE SHOULD-- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. THAT IS THE OLD DANNY. THEY WILL PUT HIM IN JAIL, EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT. COME ON NOW. WE MUST NOT BE LATE. Joe: HEY, WAIT. I CAN'T GO. I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PANTS. THEN, YOU STAY HERE. WE WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT. HE'S GOT MY COAT. AND MY GOOD SHIRT. WE--WE CAN'T GO LIKE THAT. WE WILL WAIT OUTSIDE. MAYBE WE CAN HEAR SOMETHING FROM OUT THE WINDOWS, HUH? COME ON, BOYS. WE ARE GOING NOW. NO, NO, NO. YOU CANNOT TAKE THE DOGS TO CHURCH. OH. BUT--BUT THEY ARE GOOD BOYS. SAINT FRANCIS KNOWS THAT. AND IF--IF I SEE THAT ONE OF THEM MUST GO OUTSIDE, I--I--I-- YES, YES, YES, I KNOW. BUT IF THEY WANTED DOGS IN CHURCH, AMIGO, THEY WOULD HAVE SEATS FOR THEM. NOW, YOU MUST LEAVE THEM WITH JOE. OH. BUT THE BOYS WILL NOT LIKE THAT. YOU MUST STAY HERE, BOYS. HEH HEH! YES. YES. NOW YOU KEEP 'EM, HUH, JOE? YEAH, SURE. YOU--YOU SIT THERE LIKE GOOD BOYS. GOODBYE. [BARKING] [CHOIR MUSIC] [WHISPERING] There. There. See him? Yes. Right in front. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I'M SO EXCITED, I FEEL SICK. SHH! Father Ramon: ...AS SO ORDAINED BY THE WILL OF GOD. AND NOW, THERE IS NEW BEAUTY IN THE CHURCH TODAY. THERE BEFORE THE IMAGE OF THE BLESSED SAINT FRANCIS IS A GOLDEN CANDLESTICK WHICH WAS NOT THERE BEFORE. I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT IT AND THEN HEAR HOW IT CAME TO BE THERE. A MAN CAME TO ME, A POOR AND HUMBLE CHILD OF THE CHURCH. AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO ME. "I HAD A DOG. A GOOD LITTLE DOG. "HIS NOSE WAS DRY, AND HIS EYES WERE LIKE THE GLASS OF BOTTLES OUT OF THE SEA. AND THIS LITTLE DOG GROANED BECAUSE HE HURT INSIDE." AND THEN THIS MAN SAID, "FATHER, I PROMISE THE GOLD CANDLESTICK OF 1,000 DAYS TO ST. FRANCIS. HE'S REALLY MY PATRON, FATHER." AND THEN THERE WAS A MIRACLE, FOR THAT DOG WAGGED HIS TAIL 3 TIMES AND RIGHT AWAY STARTED TO GET WELL. IT WAS A MIRACLE FROM ST. FRANCIS. ST. FRANCIS, TOO, WAS POOR. HE, TOO, LOVED DUMB ANIMALS. I CAN HEAR NOTHING, BUT IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL. [DOGS BARKING] YOU'D BETTER TAKE THEM OUTSIDE UNTIL THE SERVICE IS OVER. OH, YOU BAD BOYS! YOU WICKED BOYS. NOW, YOU STAY HERE AND WAIT. FATHER RAMON IS NOW GOING TO TELL US THE TRUE MIRACLE OF ST. FRANCIS. AND I WILL TELL YOU LATER, HUH? IF DANNY COULD ONLY SEE THIS. WORKING SUNDAY, HUH? HEY! HEY, YOU! GET AWAY, YOU GOOD-FOR-NOTHING! I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU I DIDN'T TAKE THAT SWEEPING BUSINESS, SEE? WHAT DO I CARE? I'VE HEARD WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING! I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE! SURE, SURE, I'M MR. BROWN. JOHN SMITH MOTORCORD BROWN, THAT'S ME! 8-BALL IN THE SIDE, REMEMBER ME? REMEMBER? I'M THE VEGETABLE AND FRUIT... [SCREAMING] DANNY! OH, DANNY! HE'S IN HERE. Nurse: OH, JUST A MINUTE, FATHER. Doctor: HELLO, FATHER. WELL, DOCTOR? IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD. HE'S GOT A LOT OF VITALITY. MIGHT LAST FOR HOURS, AND THEN AGAIN... BUT THE LUNG IS PUNCTURED. POOR BOY. HE ISN'T GOING TO-- IS HE GOING TO DIE, HUH? DANNY'S GOING TO DIE, AND IT'S YOU WHO DID IT! YOU AND YOUR NO-GOOD FRIENDS AND YOUR SNEAKING WAYS! YOU TRIED TO MAKE HIM LIKE YOU, BUT YOU COULDN'T DO IT! YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. HE'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM ME! [DOGS BARKING] Pirate: THIS, THIS IS THE IMAGE OF ST. FRANCIS, EH? I WANT IT TO BE JUST THE WAY IT WAS. HERE. THAT IS THE CANDLESTICK WITH A CANDLE IN IT, HUH? SO, COME, SENOR THOMPSON, SIT HERE. LIKE THAT, YEAH. THAT DOG I WANT RIGHT HERE, BECAUSE HE IS THE LITTLE ONE, EH? AND PAJARITO, HERE. HEH HEH HEH! THERE. SO... NO, NO, NO, SENOR THOMPSON. YOU CANNOT LIE DOWN. NOW, LISTEN TO ME. I FORGIVE YOU FOR BREAKING INTO THE CHURCH. FATHER RAMON SAID IT WAS NO SACRILEGE THIS TIME. BUT, OH, IF YOU COULD ONLY HAVE STAYED TO HEAR HIM TELL THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS. HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HOW THE BLESSED ST. FRANCIS LIVED ON EARTH AND WENT AROUND TEACHING PEOPLE TO BE GOOD. HE TAUGHT THE ANIMALS, TOO. YES, HE DID. DOGS, BIRDS, EVERYTHING. HE USED TO TALK TO THEM WHEN THEY NEEDED IT, BECAUSE HE LOVED THEM. NOW, HERE IS THE TRUE MIRACLE OF ST. FRANCIS. ONCE, THE BIRDS WERE MAKING A LOT OF NOISE AND BOTHERING ST. FRANCIS. AND HE SAID TO THEM, "BE QUIET, MY LITTLE SISTERS. "YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING. "THE GOOD LORD GIVES YOU CLOTHES AND FEEDS YOU "AND GIVES YOU TREES TO NEST IN. "THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS TO STOP QUARRELING AMONGST YOURSELVES AND DISTURBING OTHER PEOPLE." AND WHAT DO YOU THINK? THEY WERE QUIET, AND ST. FRANCIS BLESSED THEM. AND THEY FLEW AWAY TOGETHER, SINGING SWEETLY, SOME TO THE NORTH, SOME SOUTH, OTHERS EAST, OTHERS WEST. IN CLOSE, STRAIGHT LINES THEY FLEW, SO THAT THEY MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS IN THE SKY. AND THE EARTH WAS FULL OF PEACE. [DOGS WHINING] OH! DID YOU SEE HIM? IT WAS ST. FRANCIS! OH, DID YOU SEE HIM? DID YOU SEE HIM? OH, WHAT GOOD BOYS YOU MUST BE! YOU'VE SEEN BLESSED ST. FRANCIS! Man: PILON! PILON! YOU WANT JOB? $5.00 DAY! YOU CUT SQUID? YES, THAT IS A NICE CANDLESTICK. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE IT, TOO, FOR THE SAVING OF THE LITTLE DOG. NICE IF YOU HAD ONE TO GO ON THE OTHER SIDE, TOO, HUH? IF, UH... IF YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR ME, I COULD GET YOU ANOTHER ONE. AND I WOULD WORK FOR IT, TOO. YES, I WOULD. IF YOU DO THIS THING FOR ME, THEN I WILL DO THAT. I WOULD...I WOULD CUT SQUIDS FOR THE CANDLESTICK. I WOULD CUT SQUIDS FOR CHIN KEE, EVEN, WITH MY OWN HANDS, FOR A WHOLE SEASON, I WOULD CUT SQUIDS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR, DON'T YOU? IT'S FOR DANNY. DANNY ALVAREZ, MY FRIEND. HE IS HURT BAD IN THE CHEST. IT'S ON ACCOUNT OF THAT GIRL, THAT SWEETS GIRL, YOU KNOW, FROM SALINAS? I'VE BEEN THINKING IF DANNY GOT WELL, HE MIGHT MARRY THAT GIRL, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN GROWING IN HIS HEART LIKE NEEDLES IN A CACTUS. I HAD BEEN THINKING MAYBE THAT WOULDN'T BE SO GOOD,S BUT MAYBE I AM WRONG, ST. FRANCIS. DANNY IS NO DOG, ST. FRANCIS, BUT HE IS... HE IS STRONG IN HEAD AND BODY LIKE A YOUNG HORSE. HE IS TOO YOUNG TO DIE. IF IT WERE ME... BUT DANNY HAS NOT LIVED LONG. SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT NOW! BECAUSE DANNY IS SICK! HE IS DYING, AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIX HIM UP! I'M SORRY, ST. FRANCIS. I HAVE NO RIGHT TO GIVE ORDERS LIKE THAT. PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

REMEMBER, YOU MUST NOT TELL ANYONE. HELLO, PILON. HELLO, FATHER. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU EVERYWHERE. YOUR FRIENDS ARE VERY WORRIED. WELL...WELL, I HAVE BEEN VERY EVIL, FATHER. I DRANK SOME BAD WINE, AND I DID AN EVIL THING, AND I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT PUT ME IN JAIL, SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD COME TO THIS LITTLE SHACK AND HIDE UNTIL THEY WERE THROUGH LOOKING FOR ME. VERY WELL. I'LL NOT SAY THAT I SAW YOU UNTIL YOU THINK IT'S SAFE TO COME BACK. THANK YOU, FATHER. AND HOW IS DANNY? OH, DANNY'S MUCH BETTER. SOMEBODY'S PRAYERS MUST HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD PRAY FOR DANNY. SOMEONE MUST HAVE. DOLORES, PERHAPS. AH. THAT ONE. SHE'S VERY WORRIED ABOUT YOU, PILON. SHE'S AFRAID THAT YOU RAN AWAY BECAUSE SHE BLAMED YOU FOR DANNY'S GETTING HURT. SHE DOESN'T BLAME YOU ANYMORE. NO? NO. WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU COULD TELL HER THAT THAT IS NOT THE REASON THAT I WENT AWAY, BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE SAID. VERY WELL. I CAN TELL HER THAT, PILON. OH, BY THE WAY, PILON, I HAD A REVELATION FROM ST. FRANCIS THE OTHER NIGHT. HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH PIRATE'S CANDLESTICK, BUT HE SAID THAT ONE CANDLESTICK WAS ENOUGH, AND HE DIDN'T CARE FOR ANY MORE. BUT INSTEAD OF THE CANDLESTICK, HE SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WOULD MAKE HIM VERY HAPPY-- THAT WHEN DANNY GOT WELL, HE WAS GOING TO WANT A BOAT. HE SAID THAT IT WOULD MAKE HIM VERY HAPPY IF THERE WAS SOME WAY THAT DANNY COULD HAVE A BOAT. WELL, I HOPE IT WILL BE SAFE FOR YOU TO COME BACK SOON, PILON. [LAUGHTER AND CLAPPING] YOU'RE TOO CLOSE!
