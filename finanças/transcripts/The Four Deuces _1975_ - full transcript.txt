You know what I mean? -There were enough people killed for one night. -It's time that we, uh, found some way to control this town without all this bloodshed. -Did you say we? -Yeah. -How'd you like to take over, hmm, part of my operation, you know, if I'm going to change my style I got to-- heh, heh, I'm going to need a guy with a brain like yours. Heh, heh. -Vic, there's uh, there's really something else I have to talk to you about. -Bullshit. Bullshit. There ain't nothing else that's important to talk about except to answer the question that I asked you, do you want a piece my action, yes or no? -No. [MUFFLED SCREAM] -Nurse. -Yes, Mr. Morano. Can I get you something? -My brother out there? -No, he's not. -Get out then. -But, uh, I do have a message for you. -From who? Well, come on, honey, read the god damn thing. -A certain young lady is at my place. Come quick before she disappears like a song bird. Can that be right? A song bird? Mr. Morano? Can I get you something? -Son of a bitch. I'll kill him. I'll kill him. Shall I call the doctor? -Get the hell out of here. -Let me call the doctor. -(YELLING) Get the hell out. Get the hell out of here. Come on. Get out. -How dare you speak to me like that? Oh. -Get out. [MUTTERING] -Chico. It's Vic. You here? -Sure. I thought you'd show up. Yeah, well, I was going to anyway, you know? After last night, I, uh, I was thinking we better get together before we both get killed off and then, uh, then nobody gets nothing. -You were thinking all day, huh? Hey, uh, that was uh, good looking nurse you had. You know, I, uh, I like this, uh, this Wendy dame a lot better. Well, heh, heh, you like Wendy. You can have her. Hey we got bigger problems. -That doesn't sound like the Vic I know. -I'm still carrying a couple of slugs around in my body. Heh, heh. I want to make a deal. -Well, I'm listening. Talk. Well, uh, we let up. We divide the territories. -No. We run it together. All of it. -Does it matter? Hey. It's the same thing. -Oh, it's not the same. No. We split the profits. And we run it together. That way you don't have a territory, I don't have a territory. So we don't run into the same bullshit. You see my point? -Heh, heh. Yeah. I get the picture. Sure. Jesus, Chico, You really got something there. Chico, you know I don't carry nothing. -I don't know if I should shake or not. You, uh, got something up your sleeve. Chico. It's just there's no other way to go. All this bullshit. It's getting too costly. -Costly, yeah. I think we have a deal. I think we have a deal. I don't trust you. But I guess we could grow to love each other. That's after I look at the books. And look at your operation. First thing we have to do, we're going to take care of that shitheel brother of yours. He's going to give us the shaft. -How do you know? -I been talking to Don. Donny set it up. -Great. Chico. [GROAN] [GROANING] -Sorry. You're out of luck. Full house. -Son of a bitch. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Go on home. I'll see you later. Come on, slut. Let's go find my punk brother. Come on. Come on. -Take the god damned money. Take the money that you want. Take it all. Her. Keep going baby. Right to the coast. And don't look back because if you do, I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Just shut up. Chippy. You don't exist. She showed me, Mickey. -I, uh, I got to talk to you. -Yeah. Go ahead. You ain't going to like it. Timmons, uh, got a thing going for Wendy. -Yeah? Hey, uh, I followed her. [SIGH] -Bring him to me. [SCREAM] -Get out of here. [CRASH, GLASS BREAKING] -Get the gun. Get the gun. [SCREAMING AND FIGHTING] -Where's Mickey? -He's dead, Vic. -Come here to get me, too? -No. I have to explain. We love each other. -You're a bastard. -Vic, It wasn't his fault. You wanted us to be together. You asked him to be with me. It, it just happened. Vic, I love him. -God damn. Stop. -Vic. You owe me two. -Ah, ah. -Get out of here. Take her with you. -Vic. For what it's worth. I won't forget you. And I don't regret a minute of it. Not a minute. -Let's go. When I finish your book, I'll send you a copy. If you're still around. -Heh, heh. Heh, heh, heh.
