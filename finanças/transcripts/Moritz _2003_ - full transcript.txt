For last night. -Thank you very much. -That wasn't necessary. -Don't you like cake? -Yes, sure! Lemon! Don't you think... ...you should go back to hospital? -Yes, some day.

Thank you again and... -All the best! -Have a nice day. You were leaving before l could wish you luck. You were still asleep! l'm sure you played game still dawn. - Present from our neighbour. - Yes? - How is she? - Not so well. You only get to know your neighbour in an emergency.

Promise to rest now and to take it easy,then l'll leave you in pea. - Other wise l'll check on you again. - l promise. l'll get it. Would you like to buy abadge for five francs? -Sorry, l've already gotone. -Ok. -Thank you. -Bye. Sandra! What a surprise! l heard an ambulance last night. -Do you know anything? -No. Maybe something happened to Moritz?. Mrs Gerber's not very well. l see. If she needs help... Moritz is very welcome to have lunch with us! Please tell her! l will. Okay. Nothing complicated. Bye. Have a nice day. Are use of that scale needs to be carried through democratically. As future director of the city building authority, l welcome visions of how... to bring concepts more in to line with the inhabitants. This has definitely been missing in the past few years. Any questions? You haven't mentioned daily nuisances such as... pigeons. it's the sort of detail that is the most tedious to deal with. Like l said: ln a flat hierarchy, everybody... takes on more responsibility. ln other words, every department is capable of handling such matters. ''Flat hierarchy''? Allowing co-workers to participate in the decision making pross... motivates them and enhances their performan. Thank you for your observations. That's it. So... what now? We'll reach a decision... with in the next few days. How am l to understand this? ''How''? You'll hear from us. -Here you are. - No celebration. What? Why not? Go on, tell me. ''lt's almost in the bag...?'' No idea what's going on. - l thought they really wanted you. -So did l! Shit! Eugen told me about agreat loft for rent in Zurich. l'm pissed off too! You don't mind the birds and the church bells as much. Your usual threat again? Tomorrow everything will be alright again. We can't ask Fabio's mother, she's busy with her own three children. What about Mrs Keller? She keeps asking. -She cooks disgusting things. -Tripe? lf you have to go to hospital again, l'll just wait here for you. l'll stick the note on the fridge. Sleep tight. Please leave the door open. Venerable community... -Gat hered here. - Shouldn't you greet the guest first? Dear Federal President! Dear... honourable Federal President, be loved... by us all. Damn it!This is bloody difficuit! Say as little as possible. They'll all want to hear HlM, Federal President Brunner. -Do you think he'll remember you? -How long have l waited for this? Qnceon TV, once in the news... l'm sure l'll mess it up! l'm so damned nervous! Talking is not your profession. You're a carpenter. -Thanks a lot! You're a great help! Mrs Gerber! Could you make sure that Moritz goes to school tomorrow? -l can't stand it anymore. l... -Hold on! -You mustn't drive yourself. - l have to go right now. Come along. Bring a bed! - Her name? -Angela Gerber. Mrs Gerber! - What happened? - Headache. How long?How strong? Did she receive a blow to the head? -Don't know, l'm the neighbour. -Ok, thank you. - So, blood analysis... - She was here yesterday too. lt's me, Andi. - Where's my mum? - ln hospital. They're able to help her there. l'm to give you a big kiss from her. She'll be alright. For sure. Shall l sleep on the sofa? Please leave it open! Good night! Call me if you need me. - Still pissed off? -You took my car without asking. Sorry? -l can't stand your little games. - What? l don't want to know who you were with this time. lt just gets to me. l slept at Moritz's place. l drove his mother to the hospital. lt's alright. And these little games are over. l've told you so. l wouldn't two-time you like that. My damn promotion... is driving me crazy. l have to speak to Bernasconi. -They can't treat me like that! - Sure, tell them! The boy's eating here today. -The poor thing. - Don't do that. Who know show long she'll stay in hospital? One mouth more or less to feed... A kid's a fulltime job! Come off it! He'sat school all day. No child in my house! Even less now! Mrs Gerber has a mother. She can look after the boy. Finally we've started. Great! - Super. - Switzerland left, Aadorf right. Let's do it like that. Fantastic! Hey, Ralph! Going to lunch already? No! What are you doing here? A little competition. Where can l find Bernasconi? Come with me! - Mr Wagner! - Mr Bernasconi! You're on your home ground! - Did you want to see me? -No. - Do come in. -Thank you. 'Dear Moritz lunch is next door.' Lunch! Talk about super timing! No sauce! But it's simply divine! - lt simmered forat least an hour. - l alway shave spaghetti without. Enjoy your meal. When are we leaving? You'vepromised! Yes, but the silly thing is, Ralph has the car, and l have to go to work. l'll go on my own, then. Where on earth is Moritz?. Have fun!Thank you. - No break? - lt's almost over. You said that an hour ago! Mayl have a go? Now it'sbreaktime! No, now school's out. - What?! - lt was only biology and art. Catch the thief! That's enough! - Relax! - What's up with you? We're playing. Join us! l'm going nuts. We've been waiting for ages. Moritz wants to visit his mother. You have a car, don't you? Please wait outside for awhile. - l was very clear about this. -Come off it. He hasn't got a soul in the world! -They really took me for a ride. - What did you expect? That they'd be impressed by you unblinkingly putting in... 10 years of hard work? Let's go! Find the grandmother and clean up! - Mummy! - She probably can't hear you. l can't tell you, you're no relative. She should have stayed the other day. What is it? Some thing to do with the brain? -A tumor? - She needs emergency surgery... at the university hospital. lmpossible here. The prognosis?. There's always hope. ls she going to die? -No, she needs an operation. -And then? -Then she'll get well again. - For sure? She'll be here any moment. - She's looking for ward to seeing you. - l have no grandmother! Better for you to be looked after by her. - Evening, Mrs Gerber! - Evening! -Did l speak to you on the phone? -Yes. This is Mr Amsler. l'm flabbergasted! -The palace Angel alive sin! - Sorry, your daughter lives next door. l see!And where's the boy? My goodness! How you've changed! Give your grandmother akiss! lt's been along time... Let's go! Ok, l'll go first. You know the way. Got a key to the house? You'd better go home now. - She's a total stranger to me! - She's your grandmother. Your home's across the road. Your bed, your clothes, your toys... Give it a try! How you've grown! A real little man! Ok...As you wish. Bed time!Where's your room? Come on! Moritz, my darling! l was so looking forward to seeing you. Finally l'm getting to know you! We'll get used to each other! -Shall l go and play on the computer? -l'll hae to talk to him. - With Moritz? - Or have a coffee.They can't do this. What's that? Past midnight! What's he doing here? l'll go and speak to him. ls she that bad? She's sleeping in Mummy's bed. She has to sleep somewhere. l'll sleep in the forest hut. Listen: come in! Ralph's aeroplanes! Just play a game of ludo with the old hag tomorrow, then you'll get on much better. -She's an egoist! - What? l don't like her! And she smokes! - Come on, it's alright. -No, it isn't! l left her a note: ''l won't be back for as long as you're here.'' So, sleep tight. l'll leave the door open. lf you're scared, come to our room. To recap once more: -The exact order of events?. - Everything's under control. -A big party, speeches, abuffet... - Music... Songs announced by the school children... And the fun fair... - Fun fair?! - My goodness, not a fun fair! Brunner abhors them. Struck off the list. -That's a good one! -We're serious. lt's out of the question. Excuse me! Where's the mayor? Wehrli, municipal clerk. l want to speak to the mayor. He's in a meeting. We'll be receiving an important guest. The Federal President. Everybody's a bit stressed, but... For matters of tutel age, l'm in charge. Then make sure Moritz comes to me. l had to find a replament at work, literally ran here... Please tell me first... That my daughter's in hospital?Don't you know that? l'm the grandmother, have to look after the boy. Now he suddenly lives with his neighbours-two men! lmpossible. No ashtrays here? l don't think they want to be... in your way. Talk to them... l've done that.They've influenced the boy. l want you to clearup the matter. Today. Hello! ls Ralph not at home? l just wanted to get the news. About Mrs Gerber. -Do you know anything? - She's still in hospital. Poor thing! What's wrong with her? No idea. And the boy?. He could have lunch with us... That's hardly necessary. Does he live with you now? Two men... and alittle boy... You know,the little boy is so sweet... we finally had the opportunity to lay our hand son him. - Don't change the rules of the game. -Honestly... Despite all our years of work... You said it was a mere formality. Everybody has to be more flexible. l've nothing against Wagner. But to consider him a candidate for the post? l can't imagine... Don't be so sensitive! A little competition is healthy. You're joking! You're still my favourite. Won't that do for you? You've waited long enough for this promotion. Exactly! Are you gay now too? -Take your clothes off! - He's inhibited now that he's gay. You stop that now! - Faggot! - Pansy! Show us how to do it! What happened? Get changed. We're playing football! You want to know whether Moritz slept in our bed? -Ask Mrs Keller. -Why is he not with his grandmother? - Oh, l see!This is her doing! -l'm merely the mediator. - Better ask Moritz himself. -That's why l'm here. - When doe she usually come home? - lt depends. May l wait here for him? Yes, sure! If your mother dies, will you stay with the gay men? -l'll get out of here. -Where to? To the sea, as a sailor. l've already packed my bag. But you've never been... tosea. So? My mother has, though. l find it rather boring. Nothing but water... - If you had a father... -l do! l mean here, not somewhere... in America! - Do you know what he said to me? -What were you doing there anyway? Why didn't the delegates... from Bern have lunch with me? Do you know what he said? The little boy... that they... - You know what l mean! -Come off it! They insisted on eating alone! What if something happens to him! Or has happened already. He provoked you. Just ignore it. But Moritz did sleep there. You never know with gays, you're right. But a guy who really abuses a child wouldn't tell you. You should do something. The boy should be with a decent family. We could take him in for a while. Until there's a better solution. We have a deal. Children are no longer a topic. Accept it at last! Sorry l'm late! Well, here l am. Moritz didn't go home for lunch. l urgently need to talk to him. Where is he? No idea. He's been a bit upset recently. His mother's in hospital, you know? What? Nobody's told me! - Who's looking after him? -His neighbours, for the moment. What? Those two men? They're very nice. l've nothing at all against... l mean... That explains a few things. l'll come back later. School starts at two, right? We're waiting for he rcondition to stabilize... before performing the surgery. - ls it dangerous?. -lt's a risky operation. -And after wards? -At best, it'll be unnotiable. But the tumor's in a difficuit spot. You can't imagine how hard this is for me. She's my only child. We've been apart for years. And now this! l'm not too well myself. The call was asign.Alll want is to be there for my grandchild. But now l have to deal with the stupid authorities. You may go and see her now. No... l'm not in... l prefer to come back later. - l'm sorry. - Where's the officer in charge? He's asked me to describe our safety measures to you. Useless without him. But tell us: - How has he as signed his task for? -He's ordered some security agents. What is this place? l sent you the guide lines for the cantonal police... - We've never hadan incident here. -You've never had the President here. lf you can't guarantee total security, we'll have to cancel the whole show. The elderly lady this morning: We must deal with it. lt's about Angela Gerber... Postpone it until after Brunner's visit! lmpossible. The grandmother'll freak out. There's a grandmother? Case solved! Sort it out today, ok? l'll try! Do it! See you tonight. You too. Home already? -Too early for you? - God damn it! You've been in a bad mood for days. What's going on? -And Moritz? - Starting to get on my nerves. l move my ass, cook for him. He doesn't give a damn. - l told you so! -Oh,thank you! Great! Where are you going? Out! You can look after him for a change. Oh, and l had avisit from an idiot... Wehrli. Municipal clerk. Wants to talk to you. - Why? -Because of Moritz. Keller sent him.That's her name, right?The one living next door? Came snooping around. -l just had to tell her alittle story. - What story? What do you think? From behind and... - Cut the crap! What did you say? -Nothing bad. -That we laid our hands on him. - What? Are you nuts? Do you know how long it took people to accept me here? With you, what's more? -You've ruined it all! -Do you want to rotin this dump? We wanted to try it out here. Forget it! We can't show up in the village anymore. Your old paranoia. Who gives a damn about gay people these days! You're spreading the rumour that we're pedophiles. Are you totally deranged? This is the countryside! lf you don't give a shit about our relationship, just fuck off! The stupid cow keeps an eye on the whole neighbourhood. You wanted to get rid of Moritz. l said from the beginning that l didn't want it. What are you complaining about? l'm the one putting in all the work. How much longer? What if his mum won't come home? She will! You said she would! True. But it may take sometime. Why can't l stay with you until then? Children have no place in my house nor in my life. Don't you understand? But Andi's here as well!And l know how to cook! Fried eggs! Come with me! l'll leave all your things alone. l only played with this. l didn't break it! Can you really fly? Small planes. May l come with you once? Wow! Not bad! For his best friends only. Want to give me back yours at the same time? Asshole! l'm telling you... The rules: no hair in the sink, cleaning 3 times a week, no playing in here. -Take that mask off! -A chilles, please! -You can't eat with it on. - Fabio, give it arest. Your fork.Take it off. Moritz said he'll go to sea... - lf his mother dies. -Who's looking after him? - We'll find a solution. -Stop bugging me! Fabio, stop it! We can always put him in his grandma's care. You know that won't work. You said yourself how much you disliked her. Are you going to pick up that fork? -He's eating with his hands! - Fabio, stop it! -How can you just sit there? - l'll do what l can! He could come here! He'll beat ease. He can play with Fabio. -Super! - ls Moritz coming here? lt only complicates things. Assert yourself for achange. Daddy, please! We can't just interfere! Why not? What are you doing? ''Don't just sit there'', you said. - ldidn't mean it! - You're right. lt's urgent. -Dad, may l come with you? -That's not possible. -We're having dinner! - Everybody's at home now. -Have you spoken to the grandmother? - What? Moritz's grandmother. l've just been to see her. She's nice. Good evening, Mr Wehrli! You're working late! Good evening. Ralph and Andi are much nicer. l'll talk to your grandmother again. l'm staying here. We've got a problem, then. lt's impossible without legal proedings. To examine whet her you're eligible as a foster family. What? This is not an adoption, but merely a temporary solution. ln acase of litigation,the case must be settled by the appropriate authority. Crazy! What would we do without our authorities? - Do we stand a chance? - Easier for women...! Possible. And there's the grandmother. And both of you work. -Avisit from the social worker first... - Honestly,this is madness. Excuse me, the hospital called. Angela's operation is in 2 days. l'm going to see her. You coming? Why don't you go in first? -l missed you! - l visited you yesterday. But you were fast asleep.Are you better now? How did you get here? Mummy, please don't get cross. -Hello,Angela. -Please leave. - Listen to me. -Please go. Alright, but first... l want to say something. -We've both made mistakes... - Please! Not now! Alright, l'll wait. l'll look after Moritz until you're back. But this time, you can't blame me! l've dropped everything for you! Let's go, Moritz! No! What's happening? She's in pain, obviously. Give her a sedative. Please make her leave! -You'd better leave. -Not without the boy. We've only just arrived. - l'm in charge! - Come back tomorrow. lt's long past visiting hours. How stubborn she is! Come on, hurry up! -The wrong train! - l have to pass by my home first. ls he at his place? Looks like it. Hardly moved in, gone already. Don't get sentimental. ls Moritz here? He's gone! He's run away. l've looked all over the station for him. - Let's call the police! - l've done that. Has he got any money? Are there any more trains? Don't know. lt doesn't necessarily mean that something's happened. She'll hate me for the rest of my life! l've done everything wrong. She came at absolutely the wrong moment. l tried to make the best of it, started working, as a barmaid. l kept warning her, warning her. And what did she do? Got herself pregnant. Hey! lsn't that the faggots' sweet little boy? Hey, come on, give it to me. Give me a blowjob. Hey, auntie, isn't it past your bedtime? l'll cal lthe police now. lf something happens to Moritz... l mustn't think about it... Good night, grandma. You're bleeding! Tell me... How did this happen? Does it still hurt? You can always reach me at this number. Bye. The operation's tomorrow.They'll call us... when it's over. Do l have to go to school? Exactly.And make yourself some fried eggs for lunch, ok? Have you had a wash rently?. You smell abit. -But my knee... -Just be careful. Get on with it or you'll be late. Oh! Sorry. Come on in!The shower's free. Don't worry! l won't eat you... l'm almost finished. Need a hand? Come on out. -l she inhibited or what! - Not everybody's like you. That's why you're crazy about me. Aren't you going to work today? Yes, l am. Why? - Where's the shampoo? -The shampoo? -You're the mayor, aren't you? - Keller. Please, you must help me. l'm taking charge of the matter now. -A question! - Yes? Excuse me a second. What if it rains?. lt never rains here. lt's always been ok. Where would you go instead? The forecast's good. You've no idea who's coming.The press alone require 50 seats! Well, we could always... use the hall. But that won't be necessary. The hall? -l'll take care of it. - lf you don't, l'll talk to the press. Goodbye! Perfect! Really! Why didn't you say so before? The entire event'll take place in here. Much safer. - But... -Don't worry. it can all be rearranged. You'll manage! -They want it to be in the hall! -And? What did you say?. Nothing. lt'll be outside. More to the right... A bit more! Now it's fine. Looking for someone? Where can l find Mr Amsler or... Mr Moser? ls it because of Moritz? Yes, it is. The gentlemen are both at work. What about a cup of coffee? So you haven't come in vain. Mr Amsler? We're about... to make our decision. We need someone with visions. What kind of visions?''Flat''ones? Maybe lwasn't being clear. We're about to choose you. Come to my office after 4p.m. to discuss the details. - l do believel have other plans. - Or shortly before lunch...? - How's your mum? - Her operation's tomorrow. l'll keep my fingers crossed. -And your neighbours? - Ralph said he'd take me flying. - l want to go too! -My goodness! My mum's scared of flying. - Let me show you something! - Fabio! l've finished ! Let's go! - Hi, Dad! - Oh, damn it! - What's up? - Why's Moritz here today of all days?. Because Fabio brought him home. Don't dramatize it! - Sitdown and have a bite. - l've finished! The social worker's checking on the foster family today. - She'll have to come back tomorrow. - You've no idea! Keller wants to take the case off me. What? Not again! - Don't put up with it. - l won't. Tell him that he can't do without you. l know! But this is about Moritz. Bloody gay bastards! Piss off! We don't want you here, got it? Andi? lt's Ralph. Please call me back. -He has to be placad in a stable family. - l couldn't agree more. Moritz had lunch with us. You're off the case.The faster you arrange it, the better. The boy's perfectly alright at the two men's home. -A child mustn't be alone at lunch. - My wife was at home. Neither of thet women were.The boy has to have a stable home. What are you talking about? You've never even seen him! He can stay with us a little. l've found a good foster family in the next village. Now l've got things to do. l've got to give my PE lesson. -They're coming to get Moritz. - Who? A social worker. She wants to place him with a foster family. ls his mother in such a bad way? -Are you his teacher? -Let's discussit calmly. -Where can l find Moritz Gerber? -No more talking! Get on with it! -They're taking you to a foster home! - What? Why? They're outside. Children without parents always live in foster homes. Are you running away? God damn it! l'm sick and tired of this! Another sound and you're fired! What are you waiting for? lt'd be better if the teacher got him. For the classas well. Whatever! Just do it! l'll have a look. He's gone! - He probably jumped from the window. -Damn it!This is an ice mess! Andi? Oh, Mr Wehrli... Moritz? No. Not again? But why? Yes. Goodbye. ls it really that bad? Ralph,that sort of stuff is over. Nobody'll ever beat you up again. lt's stirring up old memories. Holy shit! - Did you see anything? - No, no thing at all. Gone already, the bastards. Just a few stupid idiots. The calls,the crap we'll find in the letterbox again... We'll strike back! Always on the lookout, scared of not getting a job, a flat... Ok, but in this case somebody's against us taking care of Moritz. Moritz... He's run away again. What now? You stay here... and strike back! l thought he was with my mother? He didn't want to. lf something goes wrong... l wish... Moritz could choose his new home. Promise! l promise! Look who's here! Can't l stay here? Be brave! Make yourselves a nice day tomorrow. - Bye! -Bye! -ls it Andi's birthday today?. - Not at all! What did he say? - Evening, gentlemen! - Evening! lt's 10p.m.! What would you like? Prosecco or Campari? You must turn your music down. lt's night time. Somebody threw this stone at our window today. Would you like to file areport? Come to the police station tomorrow. Now turn the music down! Showing up at last? Well, do something! You're the mayor after all. Jimmy! What are you doing here? Have we got an understanding? At last! That could have been a hefty fine! Goodnight, everybody! Going to bed already?. it's none of my business... what they do at their place. Who was that guy smiling at you like that? No idea. Must have confused me with someone else. - Why did you run back into the house? - Well, because... Bloody hell! Why are you grilling me? Something's wrong. He confused you with someone else, called you Jimmy. You behaved as if... Crap! Are you losing it?! l'm beginning to disbelieve every word you say. Crazy! Your secretary says the municipal councillor is shocked. Does that mean...? No! l don't believe it! Damn waste of time! There's a broken window. - Hello, Mr Wehrli. -Hello. - What are you doing here? - Where's Moritz? We've come to get him. But he's out. - Ralph's car is gone. - Did they take the boy? Shit! They wouldn't kidnap him, would they? Maybe they went to visit his mother. - l wouldn't put anything past them. -The Federal President's coming... and we're running after two pedophiles! - Unbelievable! - Let's call the police! That's enough!They're decent people. l'll request an emergency meeting. Think about what the grandmother'll do! She threatened me with the press! You fool! You don't need to come to work anymore! Do you know what l say? Fuck you! For Mummy! She loves these more than anything. Once she's better, we'll bring her here. What are we doing? Me rely one more mouth to feed. Hasn't it ever upset you not to be able to have kids?. Just tell me if it gets too much... l'll see it through on my own. Nurse! Nurse! Where's my daughter? She's being operated on. Weren't you told? My goodness! lt slipped my mind completely! Better go home again. -No, l'll wait here. -But... - What's happened? - Keller's fired me. What next! He hasn't got the authority. -Tell me what's going on? - How stupid! l have to reach Amsler. If Keller calls the police, all hell will let loose. Don't swear! You really had it out with him? Mr Amsler! Thank God! Listen... Where on earth are you? Yes. Sure. Thank you. Bye, Mr Wehrli. -And? - Keller's calling in the police! - Why? -They say we've kidnapped you. - Unless we rush back now... -They're nuts. What will they do? They'll look for us. Then let's go to Amsterdam or further! And my mother? She'll join us, once she's better. lf something happened to her... and if you could choose, where would you like to live? With you. But... - l don't know... - What? Say it. l don't know whether l... want to become... gay like you. You won't have to for us! Shall we start at last? What about the grandmother? The two men have to be back first. That's exactly the point. lf something happens to the boy, we're responsible... and it'll be published tomorrow, of all days. -The first reporters have arrived. -Moritzis fine! You'd have to prove... that first. But where is he? A kidnapping! -An excursion! -Which of the two? They ran away because we want to place him with a family. Please, Miss. Our enquiry shows that Ralph Amsler... and Andreas Moser, do miciledat Birkenweg... Moritz! Go on, get the boy! Nothings's been decided and this doesn't look like akidnapping. - Please sitdown. -As the mayor, l demand immediate... May l say something first? lf you must. Moritz's mother was operated on today. The hospital will ring us any moment now. lt is her dearest wish that Moritz may choose where he wants to live. ln case so meething goes wrong. But it's a question of where... the boy's best taken care of, not where he find sit cool right now. Please read on. l'm not quite sure... Read on! Give it to me. Both men have a job and... have neither a relational nor an emotional connection with the boy. Come off it! Who said this nonsense? You've not seen us once with the boy. -You be quiet now! - Let's talk to the boy first! Useless! They've manipulated the boy. Tell me... Don't we both know a certain ''Jimmy''? Let's wait outside! Don't worry, Moritz, we're staying here. Let's hear your story. Why don't you call the hospital? What about this''Jimmy''? l've just been to the hospital! l really like it at Ralph and Andi's. -You don't have your own room! -Yes, l do! And they cook for you? The operation went well! We're delighted! We can take a decision now. At last! Everybody's here. Let's go. Herbert... l'm not coming. Won't you come in? l can't bear this anymore. Bye, Herbert! On my way here, l started reminiscing and thinking about... the time l left the village as a young man. At the time l thought... that the village l was leaving was narrow-minded, stubborn and not up to date. What l find particularly touching today... is that things have really changed. The village has become... a muiticultural place in its own right, where... people communicate with each other and strive for understanding... and frankness, thus showing mutual respect. l'm really delighted to call this my home. Let me conclude my speech with the proud statement: ''l am an Aadorfer!'' May l introduce Moritz to you? Hello, how old are you? Eight? Nine! Your son?
