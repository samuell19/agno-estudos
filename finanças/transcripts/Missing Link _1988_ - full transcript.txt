[ Animals Chittering ] [ Lion Snarling ] [ Snarling Continues ] [ Man Narrating ] Dinosaurs have long since vanished from the earth, and our primitive ancestors share the planet... with animals that have already evolved into familiar forms. But there exists a race with whom man will not share, and there is conflict in the land. Man has mastered fire and can make tools and weapons from stone. The simple man-apes know nothing of tools or weapons, and in the competition for food and shelter, they are no match for man. [ Zebra Snorts ] The sound and scent of man are everywhere. At night, his fires have become beacons on the edges of the man-ape's shrinking world.
