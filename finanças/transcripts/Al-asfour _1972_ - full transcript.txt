THE SPARROW Greetings precede our words to those here with us. A tiny delicate bird sings eloquent words, about a land of dark-skinned folk... a moon... a river bank... and a boat... and companions on a harsh journey. The image of a crowd... a parade in the eyes of a pretty girl. Full of words and meaning. O beautiful Egypt, in your gelbab and veil. Time is your suitor It passes on, you come forward... stepping over hardship. Night and nights have passed over you. Your resolve stays the same. Your smile stays the same. Your laugh and the day brightens. After sundown and nightfall, the sun finds you young and fair. O lovely one! Beautiful! The night... is islands islands... spread across the sea. Down is a growing flame... which the waves never quench. The shore is spread with cities over which the sun shines. Your hand is ours. Help us. No matter how rough the wave... with resolve, unity... and willpower... we'll ride it. Abroad or locally, It's all our concern. That local guy Abu Khedr is dangerous. More dangerous than foreign powers. Riyad! Let's go! Won't you kiss me goodbye, Raouf? - Goodbye. Raouf... Raouf! This is a letter to the chief of security, an old friend of mine. On your way to Assiut, go to the governorate and give it to him. He'll look after you Goodbye, son. Goodbye, boys! - Your dad sends his greetings. Take the letter to chief of security, and tell him your dad sends greetings. And my mom, too. - Yes... His mom tells you to tuck him in at night. What if I tear it up? - It may contain something important. More important than what's happening? Three battalions deployed on the Syrian border Think it's for real this time? - They're always hungry for more land. Take it seriously this time. - We do. Look here, boy! If you don't keep me up to date... I'll never know you again! Understand? Goodbye! The letters, general! - Alright. Take care! - You take care of you know who! We're leaving, Bearing arms. God bless! Live on my country... Too bad the bird has flown, the bullet missed. You ran off, Dandoun to show them all. They stole your cap, you returned with your head bare. Abu Khedr... A mystery, a ghost I'll find you even if you're at the end of the earth. The end of the earth is far and wide. He who wants to reach it must be prepared for hardship Who'll meet him fist? You or the general's flunkey... or Abu Khedr's men who betrayed him? Or we, who are nothing? Everyone wants Abu Khedr Everyone has a hundred reasons But our reason is our livelihood The factory, which has become a ruin- was wrecked by Abu Khedr, his superiors and his flunkeys To the truck! Let's go, men! Well? - I searched my area piece by piece Abu Khedr could be hiding in another area But not Bahr El-Teraa Did you cross the Nile? How does that friend of him see him daily? - And where? Never mind; go get some sleep He's a devil! He's not south of the canal or north or in the village. You need angels to catch him. Without angels, we must catch him, Ouf Can I get a ride with anyone going to Cairo? Want to volunteer for combat? Want to go to Al-Hussein mosque Where is it? - In Al-Sayeda Doesn't anyone know anything in this place? We're leaving... bearing arms... We've only been here a few days but I'm bored to death The waiting... Any kind of waiting is exhausting But imagine waiting to engage the enemy Will they surprise us... or vice versa? I miss Cairo Strange... Sinal seems like a foreign country Why did we leave it a desert? Why didn't we plant trees, factories and pretty girls? Are the girls still pretty? So many questions in my head Two months ago, two guys got killed in a fight- over one of these girls not worth a farthing The President speaks to the world in an international press conference The President stated his cause: Israel is just a manifestation of the problem To the Arab World. The real problem is the aggression against Palestine, which still continues and which poses a threat to all Arab nations. The problem is America's bias to Israel Zebeida... a cup of tea But make it strong. - Alright. What's wrong, Zebeida? Did someone bother you? One of our men upset you? Did I upset you? You and all the others... If a girl passes by, you undress her with your eyes The country's at war and you don't give a damn Zebeida... Zebeida... What is it? - Woe to you, Zebeida! You'll lose even him! Who? What is it? Sheikh Ahmed; they're going to hand him over to Abu Khedr. Like they stole the machines and shot Mohamedein. My son Mohamedein was the head of the family; worth ten men. Worth an army We have men and God's blessings. Where did this Sheikh Ahmed pop up from? My aunt sent for him from Cairo. It's his turn in this vendetta No one can find Abu Khedr. - Sheikh Ahmed will find him Find him? How? In a blood feud one can smell the blood of an army. The Prophet, prayers upon him said, "Whomever sees a sin must change it with his hand, if he cannot, then with his heart But that is the weakest of faith". What is the command of God when the sword of revenges slaying folks right and left? Careful, boy! Sheikh Ahmed. - Whom are you afraid for? People's lives are precious; or do you see otherwise? - Life is in God's hands What news from Cairo? - Turn on the radio; the President will speak tonight Looks like war is going to break out. Staying here long? - This is my village. Just asking. - Get to the point. Let's not run around in circles, officer. You know me well. - "Their faces reflect their characters". Look, our aim is one... Abu Khedr You want him so you can get a promotion. I want him because there's a sea of blood between us. The credit goes to whomever finds him first. Where were you? I arrested that journalist. He's Youssef Fath El-Bab. Writes those articles signed "Cairo train driver". Kept ranting about a citizen's freedom... Didn't fool me He's behind those weekly articles about the "lawful thieves". When you were late I called Cairo and informed them we aim to please, Raouf bey. Good work. Whom did you call? - Your uncle General Ismail... - Mr. General Ismail, who else? He'll call back in five minutes with orders. I've been sitting by the phone for half an hour "Legal thieves"... hope your dad isn't one of them. If he is, what's it to me? Youssef's article angered them. They're looking for him. What did you tell them? - Nothing. Could I've told them that he followed Sheikh Ahmed to the village? We'll talk as much as they want but we won't tell May you return victorious and make me proud, Aly. Your son's a real man, Noufal. This is the third and the last. - Have faith, Fatma. - Come look. Goodbye, son Throw them into the sea! - Welcome to war, just get it over with. Find somewhere else to sit. You keep your mouth shut. You know very well. Did Youssef tell you he was under surveillance and banned from leaving Cairo? - Maybe... How so? - Maybe he did say so but I don't remember Don't remember if he said so or not? - Exactly. Exactly what? - Exactly what you said. - I said nothing. - Neither did I. Did you read the article? - The one Youssef wrote today... From inside Abu Khedr's fort. No one but Youssef was able to get inside. How come? Only God knows. That's the way it is. Go ask them. What can I do? Sheikh Ahmed is in the village for the funeral of his cousin. Who was murdered. - Perhaps it's his duty. Did Youssef follow him there? - They're friends. Is that so? Why would Youssef betray Sheikh Ahmed and deal with his enemy Abu Khedr? - You tell me. This is all a riddle to me like the Ramadan riddles on TV Did anyone else come pick up articles from Youssef? The doorman? Did Youssef write that in his article? The accused Youssef Fath El-Bab, sir. Lieutenant Raouf Gaber Zeidan Excuse me. Two teas, Zebeida. - Make them three. One for you and two for the poor guys in detention They've been living on rocks for two days If they'd eaten machines they'd be digested by now - What d'you mean? Tea helps you digest rocks. - What rocks? - Nothing. Tea. - Your orders? Make it a jar of strong coffee. A barrel, if you have one. No sugar. What else do you know about me? - You were born in June, right? You were born in June and so was he! People born in June love jumping into the fire. Tell me... What kind of hero walks into the lion's den? Wherever; he'll lead you a pretty dance. He can scheme and plan better than a computer If I hadn't interfered at the last minute you wouldn't have returned with just your head bare but also your... - I get it. Why would he listen to you? - Tell you a secret? - Yes... He wants a favour from me - And the price? Reasonable... LE 5,000 Is he going to buy the whole paper? - He wants me to buy him a few days of his life. Is this a joke? By your late father's soul he offered me 5,000 to protect his life. - You? From whom? A guy called Sheikh Ahmed? - A lot of people. Some are well known like you and Sheikh Ahmed Some are unknown, even to him. It's a muddle, muddled by you and others I'm setting things to rights. For instance... That factory. For six years it's been "almost" That "almost" never comes to pass. It's lost between this pharaoh and that pharaoh. Those pharoahs are lost between 30 million others like me and you. The pharaohs justified ruining the factory. They swore not to leave one machine in it. They let it all go. Look the other way and what happens? A muddle By He who raised the sky without pillars... it was one hell of a machine! They took it apart and loaded it on the trucks Mohamedein tried to stop them and they shot him. Everyone kept silent; no one asked questions. And when two bricks are missing they raise hell! Like they say, "They sentence you over a flea when they've swallowed the camel" The person who said that was crucified. - By whom? The ones who swallowed the camel... Some guy stood on a stage and said- "Something is rotten in Denmark" The people clapped but called him crazy. I'm that madman - Mohamadein the storekeeper? - A relative of Sheikh Ahmed. - Sheikh Ahmed? - My friend. And his feud with Abu Khedr? - What feud, man? Like Bahiya says... "Wake up" Do you know Bahiya? Didn't our dad ever tell you about her? Bahiya is the world. Tell me, why would an artist's son like you play cops? - Never mind - Alright Question... How do I get to Khedr? I don't want your coffee Why is the soil painted white? - Buried here are innocent people who were shot. You're Zebeida? My condolences. Question... Don't your questions ever stop? Why does your presence here bother them? - Ask your uncle about that. I have a question for you. - Yes? What are your orders regarding Abu Khedr? - To arrest him. - Alive? Alive, dead, it doesn't matter - It does matter If he's alive- he'll lead us to the bigwigs in Cairo. Your legitimate thieves... did he promise you that? Definitely. Abu Khedr can't defy us. The whole country knows he's a criminal. Why can't you finish him off before the talk... All the talk is written by your son Youssef. If I were you... Youssef is a wily one. He's my son and I know him well You could keep him away from journalism. - It's his job. Your job is to get him out of Upper Egypt or immobilize him till we get rid of Abu Khedr. I've put together a force of 300 men and 8 officers headed by the closest person to me, Raouf. He's a top officer - Raouf... Aly... This campaign should be headed by you Get him out for 24 hours and watch him constantly. This is your big chance to do something. Strange... I don't know why they insist you retire. If you think it's necessary that I go... I shall do so. The socialist Union executive branch is on the phone. You deserve all the best, Ismail bey. Rest assured, sir In 24 hours Abu Khedr will be dead. 24 hours later the machines will be delivered to our warehouse. Very good. Excellent. We received news of your arrival minutes ago. - Where's Raouf? On patrol? Perhaps, sir. What do you mean perhaps? - What can I say, Sir? He's at the cafe gossiping with that journalist. I warned him, sir. Told him he must obey your orders, but... See? That boy put my name in his article. When he was under my care- I didn't let him near the phone. He must have done so when Raouf let him out. It's Raouf's fault. He forgets Abu Khedr and goes around with a journalist. - I think everything's ready, sir. He intends to carry out the raid tomorrow. - That's what I think. Get going. How about that, Sheikh Ahmed? We've found you. Anyone here can break your neck Are they up to it? - They're playing with your life while you do nothing. I'm afraid you'll die in vain - I've become an important person Everyone's afraid for me. You're afraid for me, so is the army, and the government. I'm the only one not afraid for myself. I'm not allowed to volunteer not allowed to open a bookshop. Where can I do? Shall I sit here doing nothing? No, no! I'll take out my rage on Abu Khedr. Rage is the refuge of an impotent man. - Impotent? Did you ever feel you were dead? Ahmed, are you drunk? - You are damn right. Used goods! Anyone want a worthless Sheikh? Heaven won't take him and earth shuns him. You're a king amongst men. By God, they're the losers, not you. They might accept you in the army later. Maybe they want trained men during this first stage. Perhaps when you're trained to use weapons... - The war will be over. That's right. You fight, while we stay out of it. We're always the ones in the "second stage". Always told "perhaps" and "maybe". Might as well tell me "forget it" You say one thing and write another You don't practice what you preach. It's not empty talk. Be patient; you'll find your place. How? By forming a private army? A little custom-made army... Used goods! Anyone want to buy an old shiekh? - Stop being childish. The only child here is you. I'm in my room. This is my room and my dwelling. And frankly; I want to be alone. Do you hear? Alone! What's that bottle? - It's mine This is my bottle. I'm emperor here. I do as I please and say what I please. I want you and your empty slogans out of here. Out! You and your "next stage" that never was and never will be. In the name of Allah! Go to hell You and Bahiya stay out of my affairs. Don't try to fool me. Each of you thinks only of himself. Let me see to my business, which is to avenge Mohamadein. Where's Abu Khedr? You're the one person who met him. Mohamadein was killed when he stood up to the men stealing the machines It's no damn feud. Did Abu Khedr ask you to defend him? - I'm not defending him. I just want him caught alive, not a silent corpse. Afraid for that murderous criminal? Listen; I want the men behind that butcher. The big thieves. Those who steal the sweat and blood of folk like you. - Bravo! You made it, Mr. Youssef. I and those who have been hungry for years applaud you. No need to make your hands swell. Take care of yourself, Ahmed. Tell me... For whom do they keep killing each other? For our sakes. When one of us dies, it's one less mouth to feed. General Ismail himself is here. There he is... come here. So this is your journalist pal. You're Fouad bey's son? - My name's Youssef Fath El-Bab. Fouad bey is my father. - Thank your stars I'm not your father. With all respect, it makes no difference to me. Well, have a seat. Aren't journalists part of this cause? - When it comes to national security, no. There's no need for me to stay. - Go ahead. Abu Khedr comes down from the hills every night. By God you won’t see another night, Abu Khedr. I'll see to that, not the police. They say they want him tonight Why should I always be the loser? They took my dreams... my morsel of bread. Now they follow me from Cairo to deprive me of revenge When the moon rises your son will rest in peace. It's the family's honor. - Alright. Prepare yourselves tonight. 9:45 exactly. Tonight? - In moonlight. He'll come out then That's a dangerous step. - He's a dangerous man. For the sake of the men's safety, I had a plan... Perhaps at dawn. - We go tonight. To give Youssef a chance to write something good about us for once. Ouf... Ready, sir - Ask Mr. Youssef to come in. - Alright... Sir... Yes, sir We entreated lieutenant Raouf on your behalf to make you special correspondent on this campaign - When? - Tonight. He must get it over with tonight. What do you say? I sense a horrible bloody plot cooking. Sheikh Ahmed will be eaten for sure And you - will you take part? Going on a raid tonight? - Ask General Ismail. I'm writing this letter in haste. At last we're ready to move. The cars are here, orders have been issued. One word remains to be said... Forward! It looks like we will be in the front lines. I received a letter from father, most of it about you and how proud of you he is. Lucky you; you're gained his blessings. You stay away for 30 years. And come home to your grave beside your father, brother and cousin? I came to protect your rights, Zebeida. - Our rights? It's our right that you live for us, Ahmed. To live for me... even at a distance - Zebeida... Don't worry, Ahmed. Put them on him. Handcuff him. You're going to live, Ahmed. If you ever think of me... forgive me. The car, quick! You've set a woman on me? Better than Abu Khedr blowing your head off or setting a life sentence. The men are ready, sir. No news of the jeep or Raouf or that sheikh? No, sir. - I'll have him court martialed when I return to Cairo. A question. You've been chasing Abu Khedr for 6 months now, I suppose you know everything about him his life, habits, the way he thinks. One might say you've become intimate with him. What's the question? How would you feel if a bullet smashed into him and he died? So what? I care only for the lives of my men What if everyone... cops and robbers came out of this alive? A master stroke, right? I like you despite all your faults. Why couldn't Raouf be like you? Raouf is a dreamer. Dreamers never get anywhere. I read that Lenin said. "A revolutionary is a person who works and dreams". Lenin...? Very well General... Abu Khedr and all his men have appeared on the hill. - All? Was there a skirmish? When you want to mimic American films put the tape on right. You plugged my nose... I almost choked to death. I'm truly sorry. - Alright. I won't ask where you're taking us - Good. - Good? I'm a patient man. But when I get the chance, I'll ruin you. Here, man... I'm thirsty. I want a drink, not a bath! At any rate you fool, a water bath is better than a bloodbath. A poet! A police officer and a poet. - Is that a sin? - Not at all. I don't get it. You're no poet or police officer, nor even a person... What are you? - Carry out orders to the letter, Ouf. If you return without Abu Khedr's head you're fired. They're having the raid tonight. If it weren't for you they'd have found him dead. - Maybe, maybe not. They're probably at the village outskirts. I'm not a poet or officer... What about you? What are you? An ignorant ass coming all this way for revenge. Honor... ever heard if avenging honor? - Honor...? Go avenge your country from the damn enemy standing at the gates. Not on the nose this time. I'm going to look for some damned gasoline. And, so after the long silence... began the ceaseless activity. Where is it leading? It's clear that the enemy is also moving. But where to? Last night... I was up late An idea sprung to my head. This is my first chance to take part in a real battle. Frankly, I was overjoyed. But I was also scared. I was afraid of returning unvictorious. I'm here. - What do you want? - If I bring you gas... - Are you crazy? - Would you take me to the north? Still want to go? If I don't bring back the dirt he'll lie there till he dies. Will no one believe me? A handful of dirt from Al-Hussein's grave. It's my fault I pushed him. Where's Al-Hussein? - In Cairo. Why did they put it so far away? Abu Khedr. Abu Khedr... was shot. I'm certain - Abu Khedr... he fired first. It was dark... hard to tell where the bullet went. He should have worn a red cap, pointed at himself and said "Here I am!" Ouf, let no one move; I'm on my way. Don't let any of his men get away. - Sir, I think... - Quiet! That's an impossible thing to ask of me now. You're not allowed to move, or write. General, I've put a guard on Abu Khedr's corpse like you ordered. No one can approach it. I'll take the duck tape off in a second. It's your fault. Did you hear that? Rejoice... Your skin's saved. Abu Khedr is in hell by now. The factory will start again and make the village a paradise No more of your cousins will be killed What a strange thing. I met a weird little boy... He wants us to take him to Al-Hussein. Oh, Lord! Help!... Help! Help! Diyaa, you bastard! I'm coming. Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! Not even my mother or Zebeida would have helped me out of this icy water. If I could give you a stripe for that. - Just shut up! - Hey, what is wrong? What's wrong? If you want to go back, go ahead. It's now safe. I'll get you some fire. Coming to Cairo with us? - God only knows. What made it go over there? - It's dumb. It went to drink and fell in. I'll tie the rope, and you two pull. Watch out or the fire will burn you. The fire won't be less if I take some. Take your clothes off and put them near the fire. What's so funny? The officer took his trousers off! Why don't you wear trousers? - That would be a joke. When Abu Khedr wanted to disguise himself he wore trousers. Was he in trousers when your uncle shot him? What's the difference? - The joke would be better Tell me, is your uncle one for jokes? - Your uncle, your uncle... what's with my uncle? Look, there are three people I call uncle. The sheikh who teaches me at Al-Azhar, my boss at work... when there is work, and my stepfather. General Ismail... And your name is Raouf what? O Egypt, O lovely one wearing a gelbab and veil Time has aged while you stay young Time is passing, you're still coming walking over... No. Do you know it? Walking over hardship. Night and nights have passed over you I've forgotten... But you stay strong. - Yes, yes. But you stay strong Your smile stays the same Your smile and the morning smiles When the sun sets and night falls The sun rises to find you. Young and lovely O lovely one Your father... if you'll excuse me... Rest his soul - Did he ever talk of me? I was a friend of his. Rest his soul, he was a talker and loved jokes. He would eat music for breakfast, lunch and supper. He interceded for me with Al-Azhar and bookshop owners. I interceded for him with the kebab and tobacco stores. We spend that last evening at Bahiya's. Do you know Bahiya? What a night! Even Bahiya got up and danced. Everyone sang and danced. We never heard the police come and arrest Youssef to question him about an article he wrote. Imagine... Even the constable joined in, and kept nodding his head. I remember how tall he was, like a light pole. The tallest constable I ever saw And what a mustache! He didn't take Youssef away till your father finished the song. He was in great form that night. Life was being good to him. We never imagined we'd never see or hear him again. I was in Alexandria that night. Omar... I'm going to Cairo. You know that what happened was an accident. Wait for me. Don't die, Omar. I'll be back real soon. Let's go, men One more pull! Pull... pull! Pull...! Pull hard! Come on, almost done! Good for you, men. Thanks. Is that the factory? - So they say. Is it ruined? - No, they've been building it for six years. Six years! -The painters are waiting for the builders to put in windows. The builders are waiting for the engineers. And of course the engineers are waiting for orders from Cairo. Cairo? - Even been there before? Maybe the orders got lost. - Sir, I'm only a watchman. A factory like this which can empty 6,000 people... everyone in the area, has never produced one matchstick? Machines disappear, people get killed and they call it a feud And you want to avenge it? It is true that things get stolen? - I don't know. They told me to keep my mouth shut. Ask me if trucks bring in machines by day and if trucks take away machines at night I'll say I don't know I want to keep my head on my shoulders. Mohamadein was standing here just 10 days ago. How did you send this stuff to the paper? Congratulations. Tersana team won the cup. If you'd read the rest of the article closely You'd know I wrote exactly what happened. It was dark; no one saw who shot the bullet I haven't accused anyone of murdering him. - Accuse someone of murdering him? Do you consider him a hero or a criminal? A criminal But a small one, part of a long chain, starting with the one who shot Mohamadein and ending with... God only knows. For me, the Abu Khedr case is closed Perhaps... but to me it's not. Not yet... Do you intend to stay here? - General Ismail. What about him? - He'll harm you He might even send a unit of men after you. Perhaps He'll have to get through my army before he can touch you, son of Gaber Zeidan, the one and only. You've really assured me What are you doing? - Getting on Would you have the whole village on my heels? - It's nobody's business. I'm going to Cairo. Didn't we agree? - What will you do there? How will you live? I'm going to Al-Hussein; I've brought food. And when your mother looks for you? Looks for whom? We're 14 kids in all. And your father? - He's away looking for work. Look... you stay here, when I reach Cairo I'll send you a doctor. No! I have to go to Al-Hussein. Damn you! Get lost, boy, or I'll... To hell with you! What kind of sheikh are you? Wearing a turban, too! - For shame, boy! Aren't you ashamed of lying to me? You took the can from me I went home and told him not to die and now you tell me no! Get going, man Lying bastards! Lying bastards! Lying bastards! Go home to your mother -You folk from Cairo! Whether in trousers or turbans, you're all liars. Enough, boy, go home. - None of your business. I'm going to Cairo. I'm going to Cairo even if I have to walk. - Oh! - My eye! Find a doctor, Ismail What's this? Go on... go on! Get out. End of the line. - Is this Cairo? I'm not going there. -How will I get to Cairo? - Ask here and they'll tell you. Go on What...? In the name of Allah. You? Didn't we leave you behind, boy? - I must go to Al-Hussein. You'll go home to your ma. Ow! My bundle! - Please, driver, take this boy home. What's your village called, boy? - I won't tell. Know the village where the factory is, that they've been building for 6 years? Oh, that junkyard. With pleasure, Mr. Sheikh. You call him a sheikh? - God forgive you. You're still going home. Hope you drown, you and your friend with the false mustache! He reminds me of Fatma. - Who's Fatma? Bahiya's daughter. I have orders not to let you off. It's for your own good. Consider yourself on parole. By what right? - Public interest. This is Giza. I'm going to Ben Al-Karenina. It's closer from here. I didn't know public interest band me from getting off at Giza. Books are my hobby. I read them and lend them out. I buy and sell them in between I attend classes at Al-Azhar Wait a minute By God, I know you. We had orders from General Ismail to seize some books you had hidden... Blacklisted books, right? - By Almighty God I've never carried or displayed a bad book. Perhaps a little colored book... A red one... a green one. - Ah, yes There was a crowd. That night some woman paid your bail. and came to take you away. You were dead drunk, too. You thought I was drunk. You must have been young and naive then. I pretended to be drunk. - What? - I swear! And the woman who paid your bail... was she a fan? - It was Bahiya, man! Bahiya... Hope you drown you and your friend with a false mustache You, boy! You, boy! You imp! I'll be back with you soon, ma. - Try to back by Thursday for aunt Shading’s birthday. Alright. Goodbye, son. - Goodbye. My beloved son. A week at most. - Stop joking. What will all this lead you to? The truth... that's what I think. - Perhaps to jail. Well, truth must have a price Alright, then I'm warning you, we've been more than patient with you. Can't you see the situation is critical? - Critical! Get off, boy. This is Al-Hussein. Looking for something? - For some things. Let's go. I'm a person who sympathizes with other people's pain. What you can't find in books you'll find with me. I need a room. - You too. Are you the deserted or the deserter? Didn't know I need stepfather's permission for all I do. Ismail is like a real father to you. Did you forget all he's done for you? I've thanked him enough. - Raouf... Either you tell him or I will. - Ismail... Either you tell him or I will. Raouf... Ismail is your real father... not Gaber. Did he know that? What's it to you? Gaber is the man who loved and raised you to be a free man. Let's go tell our woes to Bahiya. She understands pain. I bet it's some hotshot, Fatma that doesn't care that a whole village chases Sheikh Ahmed who's innocent to distract them while Ismail goes after Abu Khedr. It's a neat little plan. I've stopped believing in coincidence. What's wrong? - I'm uneasy this time, Youssef. You should stop here. Forget Abu Khedr and those behind him. Retreat in the middle of the battle? - Keep going then, till they ruin you. You're stuck in a small battle and forget the big one. - No. Both are one. I'm not here, I'm not here You can't escape them; they'll come here - It's just to gain time, Mom. Yes... Who is it? No, this is the hospital Well, we're buying time. - This is their fourth call. They want to scare me, distract me. We must find those trucks fast, at any cost. Before they hang you - Mother! - I'll hang these on the windows instead. Better yet, I'll clean up this mess you live in. Mom, give us a minute to organize our thoughts. - What ideas, you fools! Ideas, they say. Organize your lives first. One hand can't clap alone. Answer it, Fatma; Youssef's not here. Open the door, girl. See? You can't do a thing. Yes? Fouad bey... Oh, he just left! He's going to Helwan. Any time, sir. Bahiya... I... must go to the office to hand in my article. Are you going to Boulak? - Yes... I'll change and come with you. To hand in the costumes I've finished. And take the radio to be fixed. At least I can hear the news, instead of sitting around, and have something to discuss with you Don't be upset; we were concentrating on the problem. Your article better not be subversive... You always look so weak when you get out of jail. - Don't worry. They got a new caterer. Welcome. - Thanks. Who is Fatma? - My dear father Johnny. This is what I deserve for leaving work to bring you an expensive gift. What's the occasion? Have you forgotten your birthday, beautiful? - First, my birthday isn't today. Second, the whole country... Leave the country's fate to God and the President. But you're my daughter. The tenderness of a father's heart. I... What did I want? What's wrong with me? Oh yes... Where's your mother? Upstairs, Johnny. - Bahiya... Hello, hello, Mr. aristocrat. By God, you're wasted here. I wish you'd take my advice and come with me. Where to? The English camp? Wake up, Tawfik. The days of Johnny are long gone Fool! His father was a pasha and remained a pasha. But he... loves poverty and hardship And prison. Each man must choose his way Sheikh Ahmed, where were you all day? Raouf, too... are you friends now? He wants a room too. - Well... that's all we need. You're the one with the most seniority now. - No, Sheikh. This is the new lodger; will you accept him? Ask Mom - What about me? Ask Mom. - Bahiya! I told you never to come here up. - How nice to see you! Welcome back. I'm not here to beg! I've brought a gift Don't bother me Wait for me at Noufal's till I come back. Come with me; I want Weren't you in a hurry to go? - Bahiya, we need a room for him. I prefer not to share. Do you know who this is? Probably one of your gang just out of... - He's never been in. - Guess again - This is Gaber Zeidan's son. - You... - Him - Raouf... give me a kiss! Your late father was well loved by us. He spoke so much of you... he'd say you were the loveliest tune in his life. Thank God you don't have his big nose. But your eyes are sad... You must take after your mother Your mother must have been a beauty. The room, Bahiya. He's more than welcome. But if you want to be alone I have just one small dark room. I'll move into it; he can have my room - But... - So it will be. Ahmed, Raouf... let's go. Get away from here! What? What's the hurry? Let us stay with him for a while. I'll take my bags up and be right back. One coffee and one tea, Noufal Tea and coffee? - Bring me a bottle. Half for you and half on credit. It's on me, Noufal. - A million thanks. The English left 10 years ago But they still invade human beings. Do you know what the best colonialism is? English colonialism Everyone eats, everyone's happy. All the rest is... Rubbish A couch by day and a bed by night. Don't worry, it's real comfortable. What's left... what...? Yes, my brown shoes. The room is all yours now What's your name again? - Here, Fatma. What did you say your name was? Raouf. - Why do you say it like that? How should I say it? Raouf... I'm Fatma. Do you like the name Fatma? Of course I didn't choose it Sometimes I like it, sometimes I hate it Well, a name changes depending on how you pronounce it. Right? You don't always have to answer. You'll find us downstairs at Noufal's. I hope these film people don't have any new orders. Does he like music too? I hope life is kinder to him than it was to his father. You know, Fatma... The cares I've had all my life are nothing compared to you. I'm Bahiya's daughter; never fear for me. My love... Mother... Who chose the name Fatma? It was my sister's name. We've been apart for 20 years I wonder if she's dead or alive? Mom... I love you so much. Take the tray to your uncle Noufal. Two trucks full of stolen machines are parked in Abu Khedr's courtyard. Are they going to be left there? This will all come to an end Definitely, Sheikh Ahmed Bless your minds! It's obvious... They move the machines far from where they were stolen. - Excellent. Now if the machines were stolen from the public sector - Then they'll be sold to the private sector Pockets are bulging with cash in the private sector; that's the game these days Did you play it? - I'm a real player .Just ask your mom. Go play with Azrael. - Believe me I've played at everything. You know, Youssef bey I wish... I wish you'd try me once, just once. I'd jump into a truck jammed with stuff and drive to the camp gates. Johnny the gatekeeper would count and write Major Johnny would count and write. I'd go out the back gate, turn around and come back. They'd cound and write, once, twice, three times. Everyone's happy, everyone's satisfied. Johnny the gatekeeper, Johnny the major. Johnny the man at the back gate. And your poor Johnny here The big chiefs sit with the big Johnnies Everyone's real happy. They make tens of thousands - The missing link... Who in the private sector do the machines go to? The big legitimate thief, of course. I swear by Napoleon who never took his hand out of his coat that I'm the original Johnny. I can help you earn in one day what your father makes in a month. You reminded me. Your father just called again What do you think, Fatma? We can get some information on the missing link. Tell me, Raouf. Could you recognize the trucks in Abu Khedr's camp? They're impossible to forget... ever. I saw them outside Abu Khedr's fort. They have a red and a yellow stripe each. Too bad they got away from me. Abu Khedr told me to follow the trucks. He himself didn't know to whom they were going If only I knew to whom those stolen machines are delivered. I'd have a topic for my next article. - I think they're still on the way. They probably move under cover of night. There's only one way into Upper Egypt... Giza. I'm ready to sit watch for a month, day and night. - I'm coming with you. I can ask the traffic squad if they passed a toll booth General Ismail won't like you taking part with us. There's a lot he won't like about me these days. - Beautiful! You're a great guy, Raouf But how...? That factory could have employed 4 thousand men. Let's go. - Let's go. You stay here, Sheikh Ahmed. Stay by the phone in case Raouf calls. - I... have a date. This is not time for that! - Why not? Nobawiya asked for him a hundred times. - Cancel Nabawiya tonight. Call the paper and say I'm on my way. - I'm ready to be of service - Just keep quiet. In that case... - Alright, Raouf. - Let's go. Youssef... - I have to get to the paper before they print. I promise to bring you the batteries tonight. Leave your basket in the car. No; I'd better deliver it now. It's my living. They've all gone and left me alone. This bird will keep you company. I'll be back soon, beautiful. Do you think there'll be war? Mother swears she can smell fire. - Your mother... The minute one meets her... She's the strongest woman in the world. Stronger than the world itself. - One feels she's like a mother to him. You talk about her like Youssef does. Glad to hear he's such a genius. I think Mom's in love with Youssef without knowing it. Truly loves him and always will. She sees in him the man she wanted 20 years ago. Strange the way you speak about her. - She may be over forty. But she has a young girl's heart. You sound like Youssef. - Glad he's such a genius. This reminds me of... - Your beloved? Of a man who was my boss. - You're handsome. If I'd been born ugly I'd have killed myself. Idiocy; beauty is not just looks. - No, but it's important. If I were ugly would you be sitting with me now? Of course. But... - But a pretty girl makes you linger. Of course. -And when she laughs she doesn't have buck teeth? Would you feel like kissing her? - Of course. Of course/ So you want to kiss me. Of course. Not like that! And I was supposed to go to the cinema... - But I thought... Youssef... - Keep Youssef out of this. He's the one I love most in the world - And me...? - You're different. Youssef will never be mine, nor Bahiyas's... nor anyone else's. He's in love with his cause. Hey, people! Computers are necessary to show us future possibilities for the next quarter century. You're different. You can love someone... and be loved in return; do you get me? They stole half of Palestine and in '56 passed through Sharm El-Sheikh. They tried to steal a piece of it but couldn't. - What do they want now? More land. - Damn them! It's not that easy. Fatma... it looks like... those are the trucks. - I'll go tell the others. Let's see where they're going first. We'll call Sheikh Ahmed and have him call Youssef. Sober up, I beg you If I asked you to... It's no good. Look, Johnny, I'll be back in half an hour. If Raouf calls... here is pen and paper. Write down the address he'll give you. Tell him to call back in half an hour. I'm not him. I said no. When I say no I say it just once. Sheikh Ahmed. - It's not me. Where's Sheikh Ahmed? - What shall I swear by? I said no. What are you doing up here? - A bird took me on its wing and flew. I found myself here. - Who was on the phone? Some stoned guy insisting I was Sheikh Ahmed. Why did that damn sheikh leave you by the phone? - I told him to take the phone with him. Hamada! What's this? Count them... in exactly 29 hours you'll find me here at your feet. Bahiya... this is Raouf. Did you tell Youssef? About the garage? Alright, good. No one but Mom is home. Guess who was answering the phone, Johnny. Sheikh Ahmed made him sit here and went to look for Youssef Never mind. Get some rest. They called your mom and she told them. Want some tea? - Yes. Tea, Zokla. - Right away! - I just spoke to her. They're on their way. See those lighted windows at that hotel? The truck drivers. Seems they're going to spend the night. You look tired. You must be tired, too - Sort of. - Meaning? Your tiredness is contagious Why are you laughing? I'm afraid love is like a cold-contagious. Go on, let out the poetry trapped inside you. Perhaps that's what makes your eyes always look sad. Sometimes sadness is more beautiful than joy. There they are... Sherlock Holmes - And his lovely assistant. Those two lighted windows... and the trucks? There's a workshop nearby... The Younis Organization. D'you know who it belongs to? - Who? - Younis and Co. The biggest partner is Fouad Fath El-Bab. Your blessings, Johnny, Coming! - Not you Your father! Bahiya was the first to suspect Think it's him alone? It's the whole bunch. I've found a topic for my next article. Tell me all the names behind Abu Khedr and... - Tomorrow, tomorrow... you'll know in detail. Go get some rest. Sheikh Ahmed will stay with me. If those drivers leave before I get back-try to delay them; I'd like a word with them. Can I take you home, Fatma? - Thanks. I'll stay a while with Raouf. Alright. I'll be back at 9 o'clock. Have a seat... sit here This is a table where we sat, me, Youssef, Bahiya and your late father. He'd sit silent... silent and suddenly get inspired and start humming. O lovely Egypt In your gelbab and veil Time is your suitor It passes on, while you arrive D'you think the country needs a computer just to calculate salaries and telephone bills? Even then it makes mistakes. - They have them in America and they never err. What went wrong in Vietnam then? - We're not politicians, we're businessmen. We deal in goods, we profit, and so do you and your father. We profit? - Believe me, the commissions are generous. I don't want to boast about my son. But he was the first in his class in computer studies. To the new manager. Thank you for your trust in me. But I prefer to remain a journalist. Excuse me. You'll never understand; this job is not for me. What's wrong with it? Better than the ridiculous articles you write that upset everyone. - Like whom? - People who think. Ask your editor why he's evading you. If it weren't for my sake General Ismail would have jailed you over the Abu Khedr affair. So, it's a matter of your cronies. Who complained to you about my article? The advertising people or the import-export guys? The manager of the Abu Khedr factory. Look, boy, I don't want any more trouble. I'm your father, I know what's best for you. Perhaps... My best interests are a villa and a Mercedes and all that. If you turn down this job you'll be a traitor to your country. Is that so? I spend a fortune on you. I sent you to Paris to be educated. See how the enemy uses computer to beat us? While you blabber on about technology. I'm giving you a chance to work and carry technology. - Right; carry technology. I'm a donkey then, carrying computers on my back. I deliver them and get my commission. But put them to use as the country requires? No. A journalist with a pencil is better than a computer donkey. Look... today is... the 4th of June I'll give you a week to think it over. Don't trouble yourself, Dad. Find someone else to hoodwink. Find someone to publish your articles. My articles will be read. Even if I have to plaster them on the walls myself. Why are you up so late? What can I do? It's my fate. What happened? Those shameless cinema people After slaving for that historical film- they say the costumes aren't right. - Didn't they give you designs? They never give me a clue. They sent some guy like they always do who told me 'do this and that', so I did. They're having trouble with filming so what do they do? They start on another one and put the blame on us. - Never mind. Make me a cup of aniseed, Raouf. And I'll finish all this by morning. Good girl! - Where's Youssef? - At the paper. Troubling himself and everyone around him. I bet you haven't rested since you went out with Fatma. You all ran off. Even Sheikh Ahmed was gone when I got back. I wanted someone to talk to. There was only Johnny. I nearly burst with rage. Talk Bahiya. Tell me your troubles and ease your heart. - Talk? That's what your late father used to say. Everyone would be busy with his own affairs. Only he would listen to me. I'd tell him my woes till my heart was at ease. He'd sing. He'd sing and sing. I'd repeat after him. - Talk to me. Never mind. I already have talked to you, and Fatma. Let's sing. About a lovely land of dark-skinned folk. A river bank, and boats. And companions on a hard journey. And the image of a crowd and parades- in the eyes of a pretty girl who knows the words and meanings O lovely Egypt in your gelbab and veil Time is your suitor He passes on, while you arrive Let's go. Walking over hardship Night and nights have passed over you Your strength stays the same Your smile stays the same You smile at the morning When the sun sets and night falls the sun rises to find you Young and fair Work, girl. Sheikh Ahmed can finish it in the morning. Or he can go to the office and scream at them, sing a little... - Recite some poetry. And he'll show them. - Good for him. - Long live Sheikh Ahmed. Go to bed now, Raouf. I'm fine now, kids. You go to bed too, Fatma. I'm fine and happy now, I swear. Good night. I'll finish this piece while you make me some tea. God bless you, Fatma. Go to bed now. - For my sake. - Mom... Go on, now. Let me have some privacy. Tomorrow, then. No matter what happens, remember that you owe us. Do I still owe anyone anything? I think I've settled all my debts. From now on, each of us chooses his destiny. Now I feel I can tell you honestly- and for good... goodbye. And I can also confess, Mom... that you were my one love. But not any more I can't love. Gaber was my father and will always be. But he's dead... Committed suicide. We're returning, we've sworn an oath to God. We've committed our lives to Egypt. In your name, my country. In your name, my country, by your army and your people. We're still waiting for the promised battle and thus I find time to write to you. Strange: each time I write to you I feel- as if you were here with me in the trenches or as if I were on a short visit to our home, gossiping about others, laughing and drinking tea, watching the neighbor's girl from behind the shutters. He smallest things between loved ones- become heartwarming memories to a soldier sitting at the front amongst guns and tanks... and the unknown. Do you feel for us- as you go about your daily lives, and in bed at night? Not a girl passes- but you must undress her with your eyes. Just two months ago two gentlemen were killed in a fight over a girl like her. Eagle, come in... headquarters... Headquarters... headquarters Citizens- Israel began its aggression at 9:00 this morning with air attacks on Cairo and various areas of the Arab Republic of Egypt. A military source has announced- They're paying the bill and will follow. The raids by Israel resulted so far in shooting down 23 their planes. Shoot... shoot... shoot. That's 10%... they're striking with at least 250 planes. Let's go before they get away. - Do whatever you want. Go on... you? - I'm going to the paper. For the girls... For the spring... For all.. A military spokesman announced- that the looses in enemy aircraft- are 42 planes. My gun in my hand. Egypt in my heart. My gun in my hand. I'll shoot and shoot till the last drop of my blood. We deserve this. We should have struck first. - And the world would call us criminals. In war there's no such thing. Come, let's see what we can do. What can we do? Run to the front? - I must be at my office. - Your office? We all have responsibilities. - And the country? - The country... Think you're Joan of Arc? We can't liberate it with words. Strange that you don't care. Don't care! - Go on to your office. - Raouf. Raouf. Raouf. Please give these to Youssef. He forgets himself and doesn't eat. - Alright. - Taxi! Fatma, where will you be? To the Youth Organization; I'll call you. What'll the outcome be, Noufal? - We'll blow them up! Don't you hear the radio? What a beating we'll give them! - Aunt Bahiya... My ma wants you right away. - What about the clinic nurse? Too busy with the war and all. We shot down a hundred planes. Curse you, Aziza! Must you give birth now? Two of our planes were shot down. Every time we near someone the article gets stopped. I want to know who ordered Aly to stop printing. - You had it all written. The whole gang... You find out and let us see to our business. You always stood beside me; I've been responsible. It's not a matter of being responsible. There's a war on and you want us to write- about machines, trucks and ruined factory. Printing department? Where's Aly? Give me Aly or one of the typesetters. Another time, Youssef. Another time, please. - Another time... - In the coming stage. Now we're creating reasons for war. We received the following from the Military High Command. Our forces have done much damage to an Israeli battalion during a re-armament operation in the Khatmiya area - Where? - Khatmiya. And have killed many of their men. Thus ends our broadcast for today. Wednesday, July 7 Goodnight and God bless. Goodnight to you. - Go on, boy. If it's another girl, I swear I'll call her Hanafy. Whatever God sends is good. Poor woman; she's been in labor for two days. Hamada. Go on home, Bahiya; let the child come when it will. - Of course not. It's Fatma... I haven't heard from her since yesterday. I bet she went to that Khatmiya. She's impulsive like her mother. What would you have done if you were her age? I'd have gone to Khatmiya. - Aunt Bahiya... The light... Turn if off or shut the window. - The woman's in labor; I can't let her suffocate. Any news? Go get some rest. The drivers are still here. Drivers? Every hour five or six more trucks arrive. Call the factory manager. Tell him to take advantage of the chaos and smuggle out the lorries to Al-Araby's place in Al-Haram. - Alright, alright. Just a few days till the situation clears up. Turn on the headlights, Madbouli. - But they're not painted over, sir. Never mind, turn them on. - But, sir... Turn them on, I said. Raouf... Where d'you think the second line of defense is? Where's Riyad now? At Cantella. His general was able to break through enemy lines. Are they all gathering at the second line now? Raouf... Say something; what do you think? Ask your friends; they're probably home by now. If we insert generalizations the computer willgive back generalizations. When exactly did the provisions ship Sylvana sail? And at exactly what distance is the aircraft carrier? Simple. The world media is with them. It's clear that England and America are in on this. You should have been in computers from the start. You could have accomplished so much. - You're right. If each of us knew his right place from the start... - I said you were right. My brother Riyad in at Contella. What's the truth? - The truth? Go look for it. Congratulations. Her face is radiant... like a full moon. - By God, I'll still call her Hanafy. Did you have to tell him? You can never hide the truth. Egypt, she who is on my mind and in my blood. I love her with all my soul. Egypt, she who is on my mind and in my blood. I love her with all my soul. I love her with all my soul. I wish all who live upon her bounty- could love her as I do Tell me... tell me, Youssef. Which of you loves her as I do... as I do... We love her with all our souls and will protect her with our lives. He's back, Bahiya. Find him a place to sleep. What are you doing to us? Orders to retreat to the second line. Second line? And is that here, Aly? Aly, your mother is looking for you. The Security Council held an emergency meeting today... in which they asked the concerned parties for an immediate ceasefire. The Council was unanimous in this decision. The Council also agreed that the Secretary General of the United Nations... would contact Cairo and Tel Aviv to ascertain that the ceasefire is in progress. Sheikh Ahmed is right. We talk and write revolution. But we never revolt. Brethren, citizens of our great nation. We'll know everything now! People of the great united Arab Nation, We'll retreat to the second and third lines, so what? We're through. If they came here by God, we'd tear them to pieces, and be rid of them, right, Noulfal? - This is no time for talk, Mom. Why must you always shut me up? I won't be quiet; I never will! You don't love this country more then I. Damn you! You're terrible! I'll make tea. You're like Adila's husband. He received his new daughter like the plague. What have we come to? The broadcast of the President's speech. Dear Brethren, It has always been out habit... in times of victory and times of crisis. In happy times... and in bitter ones... to sit together and talk with open hearts, and to speak honestly. Knowing that only in this way can we always... find our way no matter how hard the circumstances, no matter how scarce the light. We cannot hide the fact from ourselves... that we have faced a terrible defeat... in these last days. But I am certain... that all of us can in a short time overcome this crisis. Although, this will require... much patience, wisdom and courage... Oh my God! We've been defeated and didn't know it! And selfless effort. I have taken a decision and would like you all to help me in this. I have decided to step down completely... and permanently... from any official post, and political role, and to return to the ranks of the citizens, and perform my duty amongst them as a normal citizen. No! No! Never! We'll fight again! No! I, Bahiya, am saying no! Never! We'll fight again! We'll fight! Never! We'll fight, we'll fight! We'll die so that Egypt may live. Inspection office... Who drove these people into the streets? They aren't our people? No! We'll die and die so Egypt may live! - Then who are they? Who? - We'll fight, we'll fight! - We'll fight, we'll fight! Long live Egypt! Long live Egypt! - Where to? Long live Egypt; Long live Egypt. Long live Egypt. - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - Long live Egypt! - Long live Egypt! - We'll die and die so Egypt may live! - We'll die and die so Egypt may live! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - Long live Egypt! - Long live Egypt! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! - We'll fight! And companions on a hard journey. An image of a crowd, and parades... in the eyes of a pretty girl... who knows the words and meanings. O Egypt, you are a ship, No matter how high the seas, Your peasants... Your sailors... shout and the winds die down. There's a master at the rudder, and a hero at the oars... the mastman sees of all that passes and all to come. Two knots, the third will be the last. You ride the rough waves... and arrive to safe shores. Fair and young, O lovely one. Subtitles by Anis Ebeid - Cairo, Egypt. Transcribed by netter@KG-SMz Corrected by Inglourious @KG
