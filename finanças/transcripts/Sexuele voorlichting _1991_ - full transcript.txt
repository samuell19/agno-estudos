Hello I'm Els. I'm going to introduce my family. At the outer sides are sitting my sister Carine and my oldest brother Stijn. Stijn is recently married. Next to me sits Jan. On our lap sits Bert and Sofie. The question is, who is Bert and who is Sofie? At babies it's difficult to say if it's a little girl or a little boy. It's only clearly when mom and dad are changing their nappies that we can tell who is Bert and who is Sofie. We see this from the genital between the legs. This organ is called the sex organ. At the boy his sex organ is outwards. At the girl her sex organ is inwards. presents: SEX EDUCATION Puberty: Sexual Education for Boys and Girls Camera: (studio lens) photography: music: sound mixing: voices: production and directing: The male sex organ is outwards and oblong. It's called the penis. But it's given also other names, such as cock prick dick or weenie. The skin over the penis is at the tip wrinkled and pointed. With some boys it's more noticeable then with others. This end bit sits loose and is stretchy. It's called the foreskin. Being stretchy, it allows the foreskin pulled backwards. That way the glans or penis head becomes visible. The tip of the glans and the foreskin are joined with an elastic band of tissue. Called the frenulum. Some friends think when you are folding the foreskin too far back, the glad will drop out. Of course this isn't true. The glans sits as strong on the penis as your nose on your face. With some the foreskin is almost unretractable and nearly closed at the tip. This way the skin can't be pulled back over the glans. This is called phimosis. With a small surgical correction the foreskin gets removed. From then on the glans becomes permanently exposed. This is a cut (circumcised) penis. In the middle of the glans is a small hole which is the far end of the urethra. It's the passage for the urine to leave the body. When me and my mates are playing outdoors and have to urinate, we sometimes compete in who can pee the furthest. Behind my penis hangs the scrotum (ball sack). In there the 2 from each other separated testicles. As with many boys hangs my left testicle a little lower than the right one. The scrotum hangs soft now. By touching or cold it may shrink and be wrinkle. In the penis are 3 erectile tissue chambers. By touching the penis or at sexual excitement those erectile tissues fill with blood. The penis becomes than larger and erect. The glans swells, becomes more reddish and slides out the foreskin. This is an erection. Boys get their first erection as baby. Then less frequent. From the start of puberty this happens more and more and at all possible places and times. There are lager, smaller, thicker and thinner penises. This is obvious there all people look different too. Despite that penises are very different in erection they are all more or less the same size. At me there aren't much outside signals to see. The female sex organs are inwards. When I spread my legs I see the outer labia and opening. Called the vagina. Among friends we say pussy or fanny. The large lips feel as soft cushions. When I push them aside I can see I haven’t yet small lips. They come at an older age. At adults the small lips are clearly visible. At the top where the large lips come together is a small knob called the clit or clitoris. Under the clitoris is a small opening which is the far end of the urethra. It's the passage for the urine to leave the body. Currently sit my brother Jan and I at the start of our puberty. My sex organs will undergo many changes. At girls puberty is between age 10 till 13. At boys this is between age 12 till 15. It can be later or earlier. Until age 10 there aren’t much visible changes at the penis. The penis stays until then rather small. From age 10 the penis starts to grow. He becomes thicker and larger and the skin color darkens. Roughly at age 13-14 pubic hair start to grow around the penis. Obviously is this different from boy to boy. The hairs grow very slowly. Is the boy 15-16 years old, then we see that the penis as well the hairs grew a lot. Some more years later at age 18 the sex organ is fully grown. It's noticeable that the skin color of the penis darker is than the rest of the skin. Until age 10 there isn't much changed, a lot of girls haven't yet any breast development. From age 11-12 it can be a little later or sooner the breasts start to develop. The nipples start pointing out the vagina lips get more fleshy and at the underbelly start a light hair growth. At age 13-14 the breasts grew already a fair bit. At age 17-18 the breasts as well the hairs are fully developed. Not every woman has the same breasts. Sizes and shapes vary from woman to woman. My sister Els and I bathe often together. During bathing I also take time to wash my penis. To be able to clean my penis good I retract the foreskin all backwards. The best way to wash the glans is without soap. The shaft is washed with soap. If you don't do this daily a bad infection between the foreskin and glans will give itching redness and pain at the penis. Like my brother Jan I also wash my genitals daily without soap. I only wash my genitals at the outside. There is no need to go inside my vagina with the washcloth because the vagina cleans itself on the inside. Suddenly I got stomachache pain. This could be the start of my first menstruation. Recently my sister Carine had explained everything to me. When we look inside a female’s body we see 2 ovaries. From birth are inside the ovaries a lot of eggs. Each month 1 egg gets released leaving the ovary. If not fertilized it will leave the body. At that moment the bleeding will occur. Together with some vaginal fluid it leaves the body trough the vagina. This whole process repeats itself monthly. The next morning when I woke up it had started. A little menstrual blood sat between my legs. I called my sister Carine. Not that I was unaware but I was still a little shocked. At the same time I was also proud that it finally was there. When I woke up in the morning I noticed that my pyjama pants were a little wet. I knew what had happened. My testicles had started to produce sperm. These sperm cells sit in a white sticky fluid. Called semen (cum). Last night I had an erotic dream I dreamt that my girlfriend Marleen was sitting naked covered in a mist among sparkling stars. Through the excitement I had a wet dream or ejaculation. It means that semen shoots out of the penis. From that moment a boy is fertile. An ejaculation can also be stimulated by rubbing the foreskin up and down the penis. He becomes than all hard. After a while jacking off semen shoots out of the hole at the tip of the penis. This is called masturbation or playing with yourself. Girls masturbate using a finger by gently rubbing the clitoris and the area around. This gives a wonderful tingly feeling. Sometimes I think back at the time I was 6 or 7 years old and playing doctor with my friends. Jonny had gotten a doctor's bag for his birthday and played the general practitioner that came on visit. Nancy was his nurse. Jonny gave me a thorough examination and didn't leave out any part. Sometimes I dream about things that never happen but this give me a wonderful feeling. Mostly I fantasize about Marleen. How I touch her and how she touch me. In dreams there can a lot more than in reality. In the old days they sometimes said that from masturbating you could get a curved back or became deaf but of course all this is not true. Actually masturbating is totally harmless and healthy. After a while masturbating I get a warm tingly feeling. This leads eventually to an ejaculation. Per ejaculation 1 a 2 teaspoon of semen spurts out of the penis. When the pleasuring sensations from masturbating reached their high point I climax. This sexual climax is called an orgasm. One evening in the middle of a board game my brother Stijn and his wife Ann came along. They had something important to tell us. Ann was pregnant from their first baby. Mom and dad organized immediately a small party. I wanted to know how women become pregnant. Dad explained to us the whole process. In the first place it’s very important that man and wife love each other completely. that between them there is a true love they go then hugging feeling each other’s warmth and sex. This hugging and caressing is called foreplay. By fondling, hugging and wanting each other the penis becomes fully erect. And the woman her vagina becomes wet. The man let the penis glide into the vagina. By thrusting the penis up and down inside the vagina the woman and man get an orgasm. The penis has than an ejaculation. Millions of male sperm cells come inside the vagina forcing their way through the uterus up to the ovaries. The fertilization find mostly place high up in the ovaries. Different sperm cells reach the egg. Only the first sperm cell that meets the egg melts together. Then the woman is pregnant. Who wants to have sex without getting pregnant has to use birth control or contraception. Karin uses the pill which lie in our medicine cabinet The man can use a condom. A condom is a little bit like a rubber balloon that is unrolled over the erect penis. At unrolling you have to keep the tip free for the semen to collect after ejaculation. A condom protects also against AIDS and STDs. It's recommended to use a condom in combination with a spermicidal agent. Spermicidal is applied inside the vagina with a special syringe-like applicator. A 3rd birth control method is an Intrauterine device. IUDs have a plastic T-shaped frame with a copper wire. An IUD is placed inside the vagina by a doctor. It needs being replaced every 3 years. For Ann and Stijn follow exciting months. Is it going to be a boy or a girl? with thank to: AND MANY OTHERS...
