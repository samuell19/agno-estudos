(After several wars,) (the nation was in turmoil.) (Laws no longer served the people,) (while ambitious politicians rose up the ranks.) (They didn't hesitate to kill people by hiring assassins...) (Some of these assassins were extraordinary.) Have you heard of Inan? Joseon's best assassin, Inan. No one knows who he is or who he works for, but his targets always end up dead. It's just a matter of when. There are no exceptions. Did Geum send you? What does it matter, now that you're about to die? There's no end to a person's greed. I'm the one who he should be thanking for. Listening to your story isn't part of my job. (Kim Min-kyung) I have been waiting for you. Five moves to kill four enemies! Three of them died with just one move each. But Inan... He wasn't even panting. Listen, please spare me. I'll give you anything. I'll pay you twice, no, ten times as much! Please... Please... I can't die like this. All people die in the end. How dare you! You think my family will let this slide? They'll follow you to the depths of hell to kill you! When did you start having symptoms? It's been a while. Your vein is blocked, and you have heart palpitations. Your body can't endure combat moves. What are you saying? You might die if you keep up like that. If you want to live longer, stop using combat moves. And don't sleep with women. If you do sleep with them, go slow. Do you get what I'm saying? Just give me the cure. There's no cure. I have read that an herb named Mahwangcho can cure it, but I'm not sure if it really exists. Are you going to kill me? It's a doctor's duty to keep his patients' secrets. Take one when you really need to. Be careful. If you take too much, your heart will explode. Though he didn't show it, Inan was shaken. How could an assassin not use combat moves? To him, that was like a death sentence. And the doctor couldn't keep his secret, after all. Sorry. I like you... But the price for your head is too high. Who hired you? What does it matter, now that you're about to die? It's a natural happening for wolves to attack a weakened tiger. That way, Inan got constantly being chased. (The Assassin) (1 year later,) (near Mt. Jangrim in the north) What the heck? Come on, let's go have a drink. Let go of me! Let go! Mister, please help me! Have you never seen a scene like this before? Just leave. Come on, let's go. Let go of me! Go away! Get off me! Get off me! You wench! What the hell? What do you want? Listen. How about buying one instead? I give you some money. Money? You'll give us money? Oh, right... I got my money stolen. If you wait, I'll go get it back. So, just let her go. She's not even that pretty. She looks old... We told you to leave! If you can't fight, why butt in? You asked for help. I thought you would be good at fighting. I could have taken care of them myself. (Soup House) Eat. Wow! Could I have one more bowl? Why did you bring home a bum? He was getting beat up. I felt sorry for him. Be careful of bums. They might be dangerous opium addicts. At least you don't look like an addict. How can you say that? I don't want my son to know that I was in danger. Why do you keep talking down to me? - When were you born? - Gapja year. I'm older than you. When were you born? What year? Eat up. There's even meat in it. I don't see any meat. Thanks for the meal. I'll pay for it later... - Take this over there. - What? Come on, take this over there. - Me? - Yeah. - Where? - Over there. I did it, now... Clean that seat. - I'll pay for... - Here, take this. - Where? - Over there. Not there. Over there! Here, I need a drink! He's a good worker. Why doesn't my soup have any meat? Just stuff your face. But he's fighting with a customer. He doesn't spill any soup. That's not easy. He has good balance. I guess you're right. If you are done cleaning, cut up some firewood. Don't you want dinner? Are you taking a break already? If you have no place to go, stay here for tonight. Walking around at night can be dangerous. I'm just giving you a place to sleep. Don't you dare touch me. Don't worry. That would never happen. That's kind of insulting. My mom talks harshly, but she's warm-hearted. She's always feeding bums like you. That's why we're poor. I wish she would stop complaining about being poor. What's that? This book? It's a really good novel called 'Wind, Snow, Assassin'. The assassin fights bad guys everywhere. And he makes women fall in love with him. Reading this book made me decide my path. I'm going to become an assassin. I'll make money by killing bad guys. So cool, right? What if they aren't bad guys? They must be bad if someone wants them dead. Don't tell my mom... But I know combat moves. There's someone I want to kill. Do you want to see? This is a skill used up close. What crime did he commit? Assassins kill people. They do not ask why. Why? We lived a quiet life, like they said... So, why? It's been a while, Inan. I never thought I would see you here. I'm here for my things. The kids took things they shouldn't have. I have been keeping them safe. They bought some snacks. They're kids. By the way, is your health okay? Do you want to find out? Of course, not. I heard there's Mahwangcho on Mt. Jangrim. Could you get me some? There are bandits living deep in the mountains, so I'm not sure. I'll do what I can. A lot of people are after you. Don't stir up any trouble. Lead a quiet life. I already am doing that. Do you have a place to stay? Could I work here for a while? I'll earn my keep. What can you do? Is that a smile? You'll drive our customers away. Follow after me. First, stretch your face muscles. Then, do this. Ah, eh, ee, oh, oo. Smile while saying... Spoiled cheese! Ah, eh, ee, oh, oo. Smile while saying... You're not supposed to say that part! - Oh... - Try again. Ah, eh, ee, oh, oo. - Smile while saying... - Don't say that part. - Spoiled cheese! - Spoiled cheese! Why don't you even know how to smile? Spoiled cheese! Do you know how to use a knife? I bet he can't. Hey, bandits. You're being executed tomorrow, so here's your last meal. Eat while it's still warm. Oops, my mistake. Stop overreacting. The town is being overrun with gangsters. They even run gambling and opium businesses! Everyone knows this! But why can't we ever find evidence? Lift your butt! Maybe some of you, or all of you... Are being bribed by them. Form a line. I would like to kill every one of you officials. But there's an urgent matter, so that will have to wait. - Hey, Ibang. - Yes? - Read this. - Yes, sir. The cruel, cunning bandit Baek Do-chi has escaped prison. He is heading to Mt. Jangrim to avoid the officials. Catch him alive before he gets to the mountain. It's an order from the governor. You all understand, right? This is an easy one. Let's get our men to block all roads. Sir... We shouldn't be doing this during farming season... - Hobang. - Yes? - Get down. - Sir... Come on, get down! Farming season? You think I don't know that? If we don't catch this man, you're all dead meat. - Got it? - Yes, sir. Your voices are tiny. Got it? Yes, sir! Mr. Magistrate, here's your meal. So-wol, go wait in my room. So-wol, are you okay? - It hurts... - Don't try to carry it. What a womanizer... Sir, shouldn't we do something? This happens every day! Do what? All magistrates are like that. Let's just do our jobs. Let's go work. (Notice) This is so unfair. They cut our pay, and they send us everywhere. They summon us for nothing. And they beat us if we make mistakes. Someone might hear. Let them hear... Wait a second. I have never seen your face before. Show us your identification tag. - I left it at home. - You can't do that. You need to carry your identification tag with you... - Just let him pass. - What? He's the servant at the soup house. Oh, Seon-hong's man? Don't call him that in front of Chil-bok. Hurry on. I'll let you pass this time. Don't forget your identification tag next time. - Go on. - Go. He looks able-bodied. It's not like that between your mom and I. I don't care. He's usually so healthy. Why does he have a cold? Where's Chil-bok's father? He was killed by bandits while gathering herbs. Human lives have no meaning in this world. Some people sell their own kids for opium. What work did you use to do? What caused... Never mind, we all have secrets. Dad... Stay still and listen. Otherwise, you'll lose your head. Who are you? My client wants Baek Do-chi to return safely to his family on Mt. Jangrim. He asked me to deliver this message. If he fails to return safely... If he is captured or killed, no questions will be asked. You and your young son in Andong who just learned how to walk will have to face the consequences. That's the message. I hope to never see you again. So-wol. So-wol. Is he gone? Is the magistrate still sleeping? I'm not sure. He had no trouble eating and having sex. But he's hiding under his covers, as if he has seen a ghost. What'll I do? Oh, dear... They even know that my son just learned how to walk. I just learned that myself, via letter. Ibang... What's the bandits' deal? Do-chi is the brother of Baek Ga, the boss of the bandits. The brothers steal money and supply opium. They kill people as easily as rats. They also know a lot of swordsmen. Even the government army is scared of them. Oh, no... Don't worry too much. They wouldn't dare hurt a magistrate. They already did! Look! I'm really scared. I have never experienced anything like this. Please help me. Then, why don't you leave one road unguarded? Will that work? Don't worry. If I get the guards drunk, the bandits will know where to go. You're right! Great idea! What are you thinking? There isn't even a guard outside. Hurry up, sir. Flowers are still in bloom. Hello, sir. Welcome. Look at those rags. Do you want people to know you're a bandit? But it's so comfortable. Tut... This wasn't the deal. The boss said that he'll give you more next time. That jerk... When I said that I would help Do-chi, he said that we're family. That just means that he'll hold you accountable if things go wrong. Be careful. If Do-chi gets captured, you'll lose more than this deal. You know how the boss is. If Do-chi comes back, you'll be pushed aside. This has always been the Baek brothers' gang. You can't win against blood ties. I knew this would happen. Now, they're saying not to guard this road. They treat us like dogs. They're so bad at their jobs... Let's close early and eat some chicken. Chil-bok needs extra energy. You know who we are, right? I don't. You know, right? I don't. Chil-bok, go sleep. I'm not sleepy. - Go inside. - No. - Go inside... - I said no! Hey, quit it! You're upsetting my stomach. Can't you all smile? Smile, damn it. Did someone die or something? Lady, smile. You, too. Is that a smile? He's doing his best. Hey, kid. Smile. Hey! I told you to smile. No? I'll make you smile... Stop, you're upsetting my stomach. I'm so full. Kid, come here. Come over here. It's okay. We're not bad people. We're good people. Let's see... Here, take this as payment. Buy a snack with it. What's that? It's blood. How did that get there? Why? You killed my dad! Geez... Chil-bok, Chil-bok! I have never shed blood before. Sir, please forgive him. He must be mistaken. I saw it myself! He killed my dad! What are you saying? My son is an idiot! He doesn't know anything! Forgive him, just this once! I'll do anything! Anything? Yes, anything at all. That's a good idea. Then, let's do this. Hey, cut off his arm. Yes, sir. I said I would do anything! Chil-bok, Chil-bok! Look closely. If you obey me, he might live. Cut it off. No! I guess you're braver than I thought. But you don't have a proper sword. What are you going to do with that? Huh? You prick... Chil-bok... Chil-bok... What are you? After I leave, report this. - And say what? - The truth. That our servant killed two bandits? That'll get me killed. They're all in on it. Bandits, officials... Don't you know why this village is full of opium addicts? Thanks, mister. Never speak of this. Okay. You're an assassin, right? An assassin who kills bad guys. That kind of assassins don't exist. We need to talk. The bandit must have passed through by now, right? - It's been more than enough time. - Right? I have been so scared. Don't worry, sir. No one will know. But you know. If you try to blackmail me, you'll regret it. - I would never... - Watch your mouth. Of course, sir. He still hasn't arrived. - He hasn't even sent word? - No, sir. He's not a child, so don't worry. He's probably busy cheating on his wife. Sir, would you like some cold alcohol? It's too early for alcohol. Is that your new man? No, he works for me. I have never seen him before. Hey, where are you from? The south. Are you talking down to me? I guess the class system is outdated. All that matters is money. And I'm not a nobleman. Oh, Seon-hong. I have something to ask. Have you seen this man? No. Look carefully, there's a big bounty on his head. He must have passed through here... You haven't seen him? I haven't. I see. Where's Chil-bok? I sent him on an errand. How strange... She must have seen him. Why is she lying? I didn't see anything. Kid, think again. You could even get some money. What should I do? I can't do it myself. Do you want to try? I can't do it, either. - Right? - Right. Bring Jeom-bak. Yes, sir. Oh, damn it... What should we do? Baek Ga will go berserk. He might come after us! Damn it, we're doomed! Sir, let's round up everyone and bring them to him. They might be killed, but so what? What are you waiting for? Sir, we have to catch whoever did this! Hey, what the hell are you waiting for? Do-chi was stabbed once with a kitchen knife. From the front... From the front? So what? What does that matter? Dal-gi, let's go. Huh? Sir! It hurts... A man who can kill Do-chi with just one move is in town. But I had no idea. What do you think? I had no idea, either. And I have no duty to report to you. I see... Dal-gi, teach him who's boss. I have heard about you. I knew this day would come. Are you ready to open your mouth now? I know nothing. Just kill me. Kill you? Kill you? We'll cut off their legs and make them crawl around. That'll jog your memory, right? Inan? Inan, the assassin? Why isn't Chil-bok home yet? I should go look for him. Come out. Make way, move. Tut... Swordsmen always want to challenge people who are stronger than them. I can tell right away. He's Inan! You might all die! Wow... I never thought I'd see the infamous Inan here. Don't glare so much. I'm only here for a chat. What have you done to Chil-bok? He's fine, for now. Do you know what you have done? I guess you don't. I'm supposed to kill everyone involved in Do-chi's murder. You, Seon-hong, Chil-bok... But I don't know if that will solve anything. If I don't kill you... The bandit boss Baek Ga will kill you. The guy you killed is his brother. He loved his little brother. Bandits don't think. They just beat and kill. They're simpletons. They rape, beat and kill. I'm the one who's stopping them from coming down the mountain. Me. Are you going to fight us? Or will you accept my offer? Go on. Kill Baek Ga. You're used to it, right? Joseon's best assassin, Inan! I want to change the game. The playing field is uneven right now. It should be like this. Why should I? We're finally having a proper conversation. Inan wouldn't care about a child's life. What if I got you some Mahwangcho? Please save Chil-bok. I'll do anything at all. I'm not about to ask for forgiveness. I did what I had to do. If you want to kill me, go ahead. Tell me about Ibang. His name is Kim Ja-hong. He was born in Seoul. He used to be the head of the Anbyon swordsmen. He somehow became a government official. He's secretly controlling the swordsmen. He used to run a gambling business. Now, he sells opium. He makes people fall into debt. Then, he takes their land and family and sells them for money. He blackmails magistrates and makes them his puppet. He's the true ruler of Anbyon. Baek Ga is powerful, too. He's always threatening to stop supplying opium. That's why Ibang wants to kill him. Do you think he'll keep his word? If he doesn't, I'll just kill him. Don't underestimate this region's swordsmen. It's a shortcut to the bandit headquarters. You sent an assassin to kill the boss? Are you insane? Insane? You're the one who said... If something happens to Do-chi, I'll lose more than the deal. I won't just sit around and wait. Still, you can't do this! Let's go! So, you want to die? Put away your swords. What's wrong? What has Baek Ga done for you? Are you going to do his bidding forever? If you help me... You'll become the boss of the bandits. Who are you? Did Ibang send you? That punk... I knew this day would come. My body feels lighter than I expected. Let's do this. I can see that you're something else. Your eyes, they're... Damn it, don't interrupt me. Damn... - The boss is dead! - There's an intruder! Find him! Find him at once! There's an intruder! What do I need to do? Do your duty. Don't let the murderer of your boss live. He may be a great assassin, but he's sick and close to death. Get your men to attack him at the same time. Guys, let's kill the murderer of our boss! Yes, sir! My prediction that he wouldn't keep his word was correct. How long would his heart last? But Inan knows how powerless people can be in front of fear. Get him! Spare me, please. He's by himself! Attack him! Don't back down! You idiots! I'll kill anyone who tries to run. Wow, I can't believe I caught Inan. Don't blame me. Someone really wants your head. We're similar types. You understand, right? Are you upset? Oh, did you think I would actually get you Mahwangcho? I don't even know what it looks like. That gave me a scare. Did you kill him? I used the blunt side of my sword. Let's tie him up. Use chains, so he can't escape. Yes, sir. Well? What are you waiting for? Go become the boss. Right. Sir... Is Ibang our boss now? What do you mean? I'm the boss. Inan has been found. This time, I won't let him get away. Ibang told me to cut off his heels. Let's see... Why are you so muscular? It'll be hard to stab you. It was fun to kill the kid because he was tender. He was really stubborn. He refused to tell us about you. If he just told us, he would have lived. Now, give me your foot. You're the best assassin in Joseon. I can't end it like this. You think you can win? I have never lost before. Even if I lose... I'm not interested in what happens after death. I'll end it in ten moves. That would be fair. It won't take that long. One. Two, three, four. Why are you only dodging? Damn, that was close. I should have made a deeper cut. Look forward to my next move. Damn it... Damn... His dad wanted to name him Mu-tal. But I named him Chil-bok. I wanted him to have a better life than us. But that's impossible in this day and age. Even surviving is difficult. I was an idiot. If I had named him Mu-tal, he might have lived longer. All people die in the end. It may be today, or tomorrow. You're right. Human lives have no meaning in this world. They must die, too. That would be fair. You're a famous assassin, right? This is all I have. I was saving up for Chil-bok, but now it's no use. I'll give you all this, so kill for me. Kill those who killed Chil-bok... Kill every single person who was involved. Is this not enough? Our bodies aren't worth much. But would you like my body? Ah, ee, oo, eh, oh. Smile while saying... Spoiled cheese. Ah, ee, oo, eh, oh. Spoiled cheese. These idiots... He has made me a liar... He's probably nearby. We'll catch him soon. Don't worry. I know him well. He'll return on his own. That would be appreciated. Why does your client want him dead so much? He's already half-dead. Assassins don't need to know why. I guess you're right. Only money and the results matter. Sir, sir! Oh, no! Sir! Chun-seob, he... Guys, let's show them who's boss! Those simpletons don't know what's good for them. What should we do? We should teach them who's boss. But there are so many of them! And Dal-gi's dead! So... Will you help? If you're asking for my services... I'll oblige. I knew it. Bandits! Bandits are coming this way! Is no one here? Oh, Ibang! Ibang, what happened? The bandits are here! You said everything would be fine! You're so incompetent! Let's go somewhere safe. Come on, hurry up! What the... Who are these people? What's wrong with her eye? Damn it, that's enough! You're darn embarrassing! What did you just say? It's the truth! A magistrate shouldn't run away because of bandits! If word gets out that you helped the bandits, you'll be executed. You little... Hobang, what's gotten into him? Bark. Mr. Magistrate... Stay in your room with So-wol. Don't come out, no matter what. Or else, you'll die. Open the gate, or we'll break it down! Open the gate, you pricks! Let's fight! Don't be frightened. Let's just break it down. No, they're probably scared. They'll open up eventually. Then, I'll walk in and declare that I'm the boss! You can be my second-in-command. Sounds great, sir! I don't think they'll open up. This is bad. Can't we just go in and kill everyone? Then, who will we sell the opium to? What's taking them so long? Who's this? Do you know him? No, I don't. Is he on our side? Who are you? Sir, should we wait forever? Be patient. Until when? Dawn will break soon. Wait, that's... Take one when you really need to. Be careful. Take too much, and your heart will explode. Are you sure about this? I have never given up on a job. Inan agreed to work for Seon-hong for just one coin. Get him! He's close to death. My client wants you alive... But I can't forgive you. You cowards! I'll kill anyone who tries to run. He's so weak, he can't even stand up straight! I'll give twenty gold coins to anyone who stabs him! Get him! Why, you... Don't come near me! Where are you running off to? You want to duel? I could beat you with my left hand. Damn it... You wench... A life for a life. It's only fair. Isn't that right, Ibang? Damn it... Inan swung his sword while coughing up blood. He was hired to kill everyone involved in Chil-bok's death. He wasn't about to let anyone live. Don't come near me! I did nothing! I'm not a swordsman, nor an assassin! Please let me live! I don't know how many people died that day. But since then, no swordsman or bandit has been seen. The villagers were freed from opium and debt. That night came to be known as 'The Night of the Assassin'. Mr. Magistrate, I don't see Ibang's body. What? What happened? Didn't Ibang die? He must be dead! Seon-hong stabbed him with a knife! We thought that he was dead, but... I knew it! Men like him don't die easily. They even come back from the dead! She should have stabbed him in the neck! Inan survived, right? He thought this would be his last job. He was hurt, and he even used all his medicine. His heart couldn't handle it. We tried to save him. But his body was half-dead, half-alive. What a pathetic ending! It was fun all along, but the ending is unpleasant. It's a true story, so it can't be helped. If you enjoyed the story, give me some coins. Where is he? He's already half-dead, half-alive. I would like to see for myself. Damn it... Thanks for saving me the trouble of searching for you. What happened? You said he was half-dead, half-alive! That was the case... But now that the bandits were gone, people could go up the mountain. One of them found the legendary Mahwangcho. Before I finish this job, I need to ask... Who wants me dead so much? Would you like to know? If you spare my life, I'll take you to them. No, thanks. I'll find them on my own.
