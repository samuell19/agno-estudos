BLOODY MATINEE Diego. Coming, mom. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on kids. Your parents are outside. Let's go. Move it. That way. Hurry. Not this crazy fuck again. Sir, the movie is over, you need to leave. I've been here before, I've seen this movie. And you must pay to see the next one. I've seen this movie before. Suit yourself. I’m not paid enough for this. You're the only one who checked the weather report. -No one saw the clouds today? -Nobody sees anything here. Except for crap movies, Ana. -Looking for your dad? -Yes. He's still upstairs. Why, Javier isn’t in yet? Javier's not coming today. Who's taking his shift? I thought so. You lied to us. No, I didn't. You lied to us. He said he couldn’t make it at the last minute. We're the only two projectionists. -What could I say? -That you promised to be home by 8. -I'm fine. -Dad... I need you to understand you can't work 10 hours straight. They'll find you lying on the floor again. Sure, another thousand times. Honey, you can’t plan around these things. Shouldn't you be studying? That's what I'm going to do. How? It'll be better at home than stuck in here with me coughing. I know, that's why I had Maria Julia call you a cab. Who's going to take care of this? -No way, you're crazy. -I've seen you do it since I was 5. You were little. And took your advanced class at 16. But-- -Something else to say? -Yes. You probably don’t remember how to change projection formats. It's not that easy. OK, I taught you how the projector works, but there are things you don't know. Like what, Dad? What if a frame gets stuck in front of the lamp? The frame burns, the film splits in two. I disengage the roll, glue it together and thread it back while the audience boos. You told me that it rarely happens and it's unpredictable. Just like me passing out. Everything is unpredictable. Some nights, everything runs smoothly. And then, bang, something like this happens. Dad, split film is the least of my worries. All set. They're all gone. -Did either of you call a cab? -Yes. It's for me. The show starts in 5, who's going to... My daughter is in charge of everything. She studied engineering, so... I’m sure she’ll even be better at it. Hold my arm. Is here okay? Here is better. Yes. It's pouring. Take care of my daughter. So long. Make sure to lock everything. INAUDIBLE Where the hell is Sana? I don't know, he said to wait here. Sounds like him. Sana won't come. Let's go in, I don't want to miss-- Wait, let's finish this first. We can sneak this one in. No dude, they know me here. If they catch us drinking they kick us out. Brooke Shields, that's her name. -Who's Brooke Shields? -From the Blue Lagoon. The girl in the bus looked like Brooke Shields. The girl in the bus again? When was the last time you got some? When you’re out in the streets, don't you ever think: this is the last time I'll see this person? No, not in Montevideo. -He spilled the vodka. -Jack-off. Let's go in. Let's go. Do you come here often? What was that? I asked if you come here often. Does this look like a bar? No. You said you live nearby, I thought... I know, forget it. I don't come here often. The last time was on a date with some jerk. You can't do that here. What's the movie about? The movie? I think... It's about... suspense. Suspense and... and horror I think. Miss? Would you put your cigarette out? I’m trying to quit myself, you’re tempting me. Thank you. It's a horror film. Frankenstein, the monster. You invited me to a movie you don't know anything about? Yes... I do this sometimes. Do what? Come see a movie I know nothing about. Why? I don't know. Isn't it exciting? Can you keep it quiet? It's empty, dude. No one wants to see this movie. Fucking Sana, he stood me up. What a jerk off. -Stop it. -Let's sit over here. Drop it. Where are you going? My favorite spot. Sorry, I'm sorry. It was unintended, nothing personal. I can’t see a thing. Okay, okay. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Motherfuckers! Won't you just leave? And leave me alone. It's always the same. C'mon guys. Sit over there. Move it, it's started already. Always the same. The music, the voices, the radio. All together until 3 AM in... The Eyes of the Night. Yo! That's the girl from the bus. Brooke Shields, she just came in. I can't believe this. Are you sure it's her? It doesn't make sense. What doesn't make sense? Why would she get off one stop before us if we were all coming here? Because you kept staring at her ass? It's fate. Sure. It's fate. Are you...? Do want to leave? Why would we leave? You don't seem interested in the movie. But we're here already. We came here for a reason. Have you seen an alarm clock? No. I set it as a reminder for my pills, but I can't find it. I left it here. No, no idea. Well, maybe it's downstairs. Would you hand me a cigarette? Huh? I don't smoke. Top right drawer. Your dad hides them there. Under the worksheets. Not those. Casinos. I only smoke Casino. What zodiac sign are you? I'm guessing... -Virgo? -Capricorn. Capricorn. Today, you may feel the Universe owes you. That you don't deserve this day. Nonetheless, someone else’s sacrifice won’t save you. You must escape this depressing situation on your own. I'm an Aires. Aires, Excuse me, I have an exam in 3 days. I need to focus, if you don't mind. May I offer a word of advice? Just one thing. If you're going to work here it might be a good idea to get along with me. In a bad mood, I can be a pain. I get cranky when I get bored. I can get bored if we don't talk. Good, don't worry. It's only for tonight. I have better things to do in life. Defies authority. Thinks she's better than her father. Capricorn, really? Sure. I'll smoke this with someone who values my work. If you need me, I'll be napping in the theater. There you are, I was going to give you the keys. Would you join me for a smoke? Casino? No thanks. Why not? See you tomorrow. Make sure to lock everything. Bye. It's now. I have to talk to her. Will you shut up and watch the movie? I mean it. Sure, go talk to her. Are you kidding me, Goni? No one picks up girls in a movie theater. -I can be the first one. -By all means. She's over there, you're a bit tipsy. It's now or never. Go, knight. Wait, have you thought of what you're going to say? No. -Why am I not surprised? -Hey. Have faith in him. Isn't it odd that she comes to see a horror movie by herself? It is. Even odder is you approaching her and saying: Hi, I'm the guy who kept staring at your ass on the bus. I followed you here.. -I didn't follow her here. -Try telling her that. You're right. -I'll look like a freak. -No. Not at all. What? I'm trying to help him. What is this? -Want some? -No. I just remembered, I have this... birthday party. For my aunt. Yeah. Now? In a little while. I can finish the movie, I think. Where are you going? Wish me luck. Take that. Do you remember me from the bus? So? Isn't it odd that... we got off at different stops and we're both here? I guess. May I? Okay. It was reserved, but oh well. You were saving it? It's a full house. I was waiting for someone. I was discussing that with my friends. That you look like you've been stood up. I look like it? You can tell from a block away. -Who was it? -It doesn't matter. Keep talking. The movie sucks and it’s still raining. You can't come in. I told you I'm studying, Mauricio. Stop bugging me, Mauricio. Mauricio. How the hell... Mauricio. Mauricio. What are you doing? Should I stop? Nice hair. Not as nice as mine, though. -You're funny. -Am I? My friends call me dumb. I can see that too. Not as dumb as the guy who stood you up. That's not what I meant. I'm sure you never get no for an answer. Actually, I've never approached a girl like this. So you've never done... this? Look. I told you. Son of a bitch. He got it. I don't believe this is your first kiss. I swear. Sorry. It’s that with my aunt’s birthday, we’d have no time later. I'm going to the men's room, be right back. Mauricio. Mauricio. Mauricio, where are you? Are you here? Mauricio? Mauricio, are you there? Your fucking clock. Fuck. Mauricio. Mauricio. Oh yeah, you're taking a nap inside. Toilet? There. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Hey, you have a stain there. Uh, yeah... The rain. You have like... A stain. She likes me. Hey! Isn't that a bit... odd? Goni kissing a girl? Totally. Not that, idiot. They haven't moved for 10 minutes. What do you expect them to do, fuck? Calm down. Everything is normal. This is not right. I'll go talk to Goni. So nobody wants to see the film. Esteban! Hurry! Let go of him! Just a sec! Coming! Help! Keep off me! Stay away! Stay away! What? -What? -He killed Esteban. -And killed Goni. -Who? I can't get out. -Who? I don't know who he is. Wait a second-- Him. Stay away. We've called the police. They are on their way. Stay away. Go! They are on their way. Go! Go away! Come! Hit him! Hit him! -Did you call the police? -No. He broke the roller door. It's stuck. We can't get out. We need to call for help. The box office. Come. I told you the roller door is stuck. It won't open. The door is locked. He has the keys. Who the hell let this guy in? Where did he come from? Why don't you answer me? -You know him. -No idea. We need to sort this out, then we can panic. Stop. Stop. You're cutting yourself. Stop. Calm down. -I want to get out of here. -Me too. We need to calm down or we'll kill ourselves. -What's your name? -Angela. I'm Ana. My dad works in this theater. I know this place. This guy is locked in. -I need the phone. -Yes. I'll open up with one of those keys. -It's in there, I'm going to open the door. -Yes. He killed Goni, he killed Esteban. He killed those girls too. Keep calm. There's another phone in the projection room. Come, it's upstairs. Wait. Let's go. -The kid. -What? There's a kid inside. -Where are you going? -To get the kid out. Don't open Ana. You crazy fuck. Sit. Are you OK? We'll get out of here soon You'll be fine. What's your name? Police? I'm calling from the Opera Cinema. Yes. Good. Tomas. They're on their way. -We stay here and be quiet. -OK. -Has he hurt you? -He's good. He only hit his knee. Right Tomas? He said his name is Tomas. Ana, you have some blood... Do you think... ...he's dead? I don't know. Anyway, I've locked everything. Tomas! Tomas! Tomas! Tomas! Tomas! Hey, Tomas. Tomas. Tomas. Hey! Come Tomas. It's alright. Come, trust me. Don't worry. Come. Are you okay? Yes? Let go! We're locked in. It's alright. The police are coming. You have to trust me. We'll go somewhere else. You follow me. We'll go over there. Now... Careful. Look at your feet. Look at your feet. I'll look at my feet too. I look at your feet, Tomas. We're getting out soon. Look down at your feet. Sit. Stay here. Look at your feet. I'll go get something, then we'll leave. Look right here. Promise me you'll stay here. I'll be right back. Look at your feet. Keep looking at your feet. It's over. Look at me. There. You're clean.
