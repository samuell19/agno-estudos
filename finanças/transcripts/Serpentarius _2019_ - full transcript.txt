I was born in Africa but left to Europe in my teens. My mother stayed behind. Every year I cross the 6000 miles that separate us to see her. One day she told me she wanted to adopt a bird with a 150 year life span But she would only do that if I promised to take care of it when she died. SERPENTARIUS My mother used to talk about a distant kingdom, with a hot climate, horizons to lose sight of, giant spiders and fruits that were never discovered. When the rain comes, the earth perfumes the air of an impossible clay. There are trees that have no name. The water is so crystal clear that during wartime you can't use submarines. And when the sky is angry, it seems that it will light up in flames. Her eyes were lost on the wall of the room she was cradling me in as if she were looking at the ocean. "I must go back," she would think out loud. I would give her my hand: "Go." And as if she were obeying, she left me where she thought would be my place and disappeared in another continent among the mountains where she felt at home. She would write on my birthday: short notes of survival and personal fulfillment. Not even when she saw the end come, did she change her mind. I never saw her again. [SERPENTARIUS] 1. the constellation, Ophiuchus; the 13th zodiac sign; 2. "he who carries the serpent" Before you come, wait for the dust to settle. Wait until you to see the sun rising again. Look for me among the ashes, or for whatever is left. Do not pass through where there is still fire or embers. Do not be sorry for what you see, or for what you can not find. Try to find out with your own eyes all that my words have hidden. Understand me first, judge me later, and don't go away before the wound of your breast is closed. It's important that you be quick. There is almost nothing that the wind, in a matter of days, does not cover with sand. I am waiting for you. Mother. In the future, we shall live like skyscrappers. Action heroes in a future world. There will be no more angles, only curves and history will give way to subjectivity, like dinosaurs gave way to ice. Women will always be women, but the difference will be meaningless. And sex, survivor of all threats, will thrill only the brain, which is where it will endure. We'll amuse ourselves by dancing in front of looking glasses adorned with flaxen lamps. Older people will remember the brightness, but the designation "sun" will be re-attributed to an anti-uranium appliance available for homes and day-care centers. By general agreement, we will live much longer. Unbalanced and weightless, beyond our own moon, we will float into the mist of space that will, once and for all, be understandable and safe. But even the sky is not that simple. The blue comes from the warm halo that surrounds the cumulus. It's hard to explain. The sun does not bother, except for what it reveals, and darkness... no one likes to close their eyes for long. Some think that seeing others sleep is romantic and sentimental, but that is how the dead look. From time past, what is there to say? We only know how it is reflected in us. Where they stopped they left cross-shaped pebbles like someone who pisses in a circle to say, "This is mine." And they stopped many times. Surely the boats were full of that shit. They would drop the seeds on the coast, and the Empire would thrive inland, down the coast until it was 50 times bigger. But what really fucked their lives was this cape. They would get here and the clash of the oceans the underwater currents and the aggressive winds caused the caravels to roam around and nobody would cross. The cinnamon and the crab each time farther away. The whiners called it "Cape of Storms" the more cynical, "Cape of Good Hope" And as if all hope was good, they dropped pebbles here too. Out the caravels came white-skined men white as the skin of the gods. It was said that the Gods had arrived in huge wooden birds with white wings that emerged from the bottom of the sea. "Poor things, they haven't realized that the earth is round!" said the Gods. And while they were seen as Gods... they took from the natives their brothers, their cousins, their daughters... to distant continents, never to return. This is a side of the coin. The other is that there really was someone in the world capable of exchanging their child for a string of beads. This was a possible thing. But, what to do? How to deal with the nefarious power of beauty? How to resist the gloss of printed fabric? And as for the Gods... how to resist this endless horizon? Let's go through it again. Did you see him or not? I've seen the white man! He rose from the deep water, in a white winged chicken with a wooden chest. - That's all. - I don't believe a word of it. You are an imbecile! - What do you mean he rose? - He did not rise. - He appeared from the curve because the Earth is round! - That's pretty much your opinion. - To me he rose from the deep dark waters. I saw him by the moor. He ate two lambs and spit fire that was cold. He eats like it means something! I saw the future in the sour milk. He will colonize and exploit us for 500 years. I saw it. - I'm not lying. - He couldn't do such a thing. - You lie all the time. Get new milk, shake it and look. Hey, didn't you see something too? Where? - You mean the tiny little white man? - Didn't you say you saw him? I didn't see him per se. But I noticed a lot of banana peel by the waterfall. - Everybody knows white men love bananas. - Ah! Hey, this milk is too old. Milk. Get more milk. Shake it until it's sour. Ok, that's enough. There's something wrong with these cows. The milk is lying. Do something! Do something! At the beginning of cartography, of all the sandy hills that came out of the sea like the whites, came men with binoculars to invent these mountains. At 20, my great-grandfather and his young wife descend the Atlantic to settle on this coast. For her, the heat is a waiting vulture. Malaria, bronchitis, scarlet fever... two miscarriages... It becomes urgent to go up the mountain. This trip is prepared for weeks and lasts for several days. The party rides straight up the slope of virgin forest, clutching stones and trunks with their hands. They drink from the rivers and eat from the trees... When she is tired, she is taken in a sling by what they called "free slaves". At 7000 feet is a valley of mild climate. A city is built, a System. A church. The scientist Nikola Tesla draws attention to what modern science says: that the sun is the past, the earth the present, the moon the future. We descend from an incandescent mass, but to an icy one we'll give origin. The laws of nature are relentless and as everyone prepares for the next day... the next day doesn't even know we exist. And here we are: the world based on maps. Much of the Earth is desolate after excessive use of natural resources. The catastrophe was faster and more relentless than our technology to colonize new planets. In the future, we will conquer our right to distance. Be away without being missed. Celebrate our birthday alone, without offending family or friends. Acrylic will have covered the world, the recycled earth. In our dishes, the unmistakable flavor of artificial fish. The feeling called "longing" will be eradicated. Memory will cease to be comparative because we will be chemically and technologically equipped to live each new moment as incomparably better than the last. Maybe no one ever really knows when they are reaching their destination. But if it happens... what weight or relief will be to keep an animal that speaks with the voice of our mother? At night I drift through the city waiting for sleep. I see through the dark: It seems like nothing happened, like the scar has no memory. People rose from the rubble like zombies and recreated a position in life, in chaos; They embraced nothingness and filled the void with what was lying around. This is the true post-catastrophe: one in which convalescence is worse than the bullet that wounded us. -You were saying you're going beyond the red dune? -Yes. My mother was in the tragedy. -I can't take you to your destination. -No one ever goes past the bay where the tragedy stopped. -People don't like to go further. -We need to respect that. -I'll take you there.... Then you'll go on your own. -Where to? -Whoever comes here doesn't want to be found. In her letters she told me herself how to get here. But what good it it if you're late already? Keep the letters as a souvenir. Is there a way to contact the survivers? You may look from over the hills... A few are isolated among the nothing. When my mother hid herself from the world, I thought she was running away; but as I look at these mountains now I have the abstract idea... that she had 'found' something. Some truth. That I had passed a level and for no reason in the world, not even for my sake... would it make sense to go back. I dreamed I was in the beyond. Crowds making their way with the elbows, looking for people. I found her exausted... in her grimy clothes as in the day she died. "Mother," I shouted as I threw my arms around her. She just stood there. "Help me"... "You're my mother!" "There are no mothers here," she said "Only the search." "I found my own mother looking for hers and so on." "Mothers", she said... ..."parents, families, and lovers..." "...are the place from which you came." "Here we are each for himself." "Here there is no help, no love, only the search." "And this is the meaning of death" "This is how we spend eternity" "In search of the love we no longer know how to give." I woke up with a start. "And yet, my son..." she said. "My son..." Or did I dream? It does not matter what you find. What matters is the search, the journey. Could it be? Could it be, mother? -Friend, we are here. -I told you I would bring you to the bay. -But like we had said, from here you're on you own. -What are you going to do? I'm going to try the water. -Look, he's staring... -Hey friend! I realized in the dream that she is not alive. That the silence doesn't come from the collapse of world communications or from the death of couriers and corporate media. But I remembered the bird and its myth of endurance and longevity. I remembered the promise. -There is no one there. What about the bird? The lady that lived over there had a blue and yellow parrot. Do you know what happened to it? Nothing remained. Do you know if anyone took it? There was nothing left in the other town either... ...but one never knows. The parrot sang in your mother's voice. For days after the tragedy, her voice was still heard among the rubble. A very sweet voice in the dust. Someone must have taken him. Anyone would want to keep that voice forever. Speak. Speak. -What do you want to hear? Anything. -So much time, so many miles, and it doesn't matter what you hear? Anything is better than nothing. -I will give you three answers to the questions you have. Choose wisely. -I came to get you, I want you to come with me. -I had my choice. Why do you want to take me away? This voice is not me. A voice is like the wind: A gust that goes through the crevice of a door. At times it may sound like the scream of someone we know but it's only air moving. Nothing. -For you, it may be just air, but for me it's much more. It's everything that didn't happen since you went away. -You're not the kind of person who gets away with that kind of sentimentalism. Your mother left you. Will you spend the rest of your life playing the victim? Look well at where you are. Anyone who might have survived out here is much more a victim than you or your mother. -I had pictured you more insightful. Not all misery is obvious. What do you think you know about me or things that marked me? -At last the first question! Remember that I'm a bird. I have no obligation to have inherited your mother's insight which by the way was inexistent. -I know that irony well. Don't talk about winds going through doors. If you don't wish to come, it's okay. You may well forget that I was here -Passive aggressiveness. We are in family indeed. -Where is your body? -Who needs a body? What does it represent? -For you, nothing. For me it's a change to finish this conversation. -You only have one question left. Time is ticking.
