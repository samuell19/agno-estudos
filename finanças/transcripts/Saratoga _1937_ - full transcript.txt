That's the boy. Miracle Lad. Go on! Break his blasted neck. You keep quiet or I'll take a sock at you. Yeah? Go ahead and I'll take a sock at you right back. There he goes. The last stallion I've got on the place. Hey. How do you think I'm going to run a breeding farm without a stud? Huh? How am I? That's your tough luck. You can figure it out for yourself. Hey Limpy, wait a minute. Take that stallion back to the stable. I've got an order from the bank, Mr Bradley. That half-witted son of mine give him over to Ed Kenyon. I'll come into the bank and fix it with Mr Kenyon. Alright, Mr Bradley. If you'll fix it. Your darn tooting he'll fix it. Go on, take the horse back to the stable the way I told you in the first place. The idea. Trying to take other people's horses. That confounded son of mine. I wonder how he thinks I can run a breeding farm without a stud. Well now that you bring it up, it would be quite a stunt wouldn't it, grandpa. Selling off all the stock on the place. Moonray will be the next on the list, I suppose. I'm surprised he hasn't tried to sell me. Has he had any offers? Ah, but Duke. Think of it. Brookvale. When I was a young man, Brookvale was the show place of all Saratoga. When I first brought my bride home from Niagara Falls. It was all I could do to get her into the house. She was so crazy about the champions in the stables. You're kind of proud of Brookvale, aren't you grandpa. I was then. Not now. Say. We got more dead horses on this place than live ones. Come here. Look at that. Every one of them champions. There wasn't a line bred in Kentucky could touch this stock. We left those blue grass also-rans on every stretch in America. Why they toasted Brookvale champions .. And drank champagne out of gold slippers. At the old Haymarket way back in my daddy's day in 1881. There is Ebony Star, the greatest two-year old of the nineties. Pranced home at The Hopeful Stakes. And her record has never been touched. And then there is Blue Bold, and the Flying Demon. By Mad Power .. this one's grandpa. And there is his daddy. Dawn Boy. The greatest stud in the history of American racing. I bred him, trained him and buried him myself. Grandpa, I forgot. Why is it Dawn Boy's grave is out in front of the others? Because Dawn Boy was always out in front of the others. And that is where he is going to finish. Dead or alive. Grandpa, I love you. Mr Clayton. Mr Clayton. A telephone call over long distance from London, England. It's Miss Carol. Ah, she don't want me. She wants her daddy. Tell her he's at the doctor. I can't talk so far, Mr Clayton. I gets too scared. Oh go on, Duke. You talk to her. - Alright. I'm only her grandpa. I can't talk to her. She's got so high and mighty since she's been in Europe .. That she won't talk to nobody but Kings. She's got her daddy worried. She moves around all the time and don't leave no address. Yeah, I know. That brat needs a good spanking. Oh she don't mean nothing, Mr Duke. That's just her way. Rosetta. I love you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, daddy. Daddy, this is Carol. Get ready for a big surprise. I'm going to be married. That's alright with me but don't bring anything home to frighten your dad. Who is this? My name is Duke Bradley. A friend of your father's. Why don't you try it sometime? Put my father on the phone. - Who is it? It's some fool. I would like to speak with my father. He isn't here. Where can he get you? I'm at Northborough House. What's the address? Northborough House is the county seat of the Duke Of Northborough. Say, you'd better take that crown off your head and come home. What's that? Who do you think you're talking to? Who is it, darling? Will you please tell me where my father is that I may call him there? Well, if you must know. He's down at the doctor's. He's having a little trouble with his heart. Heart? Is .. is it serious? Well, he'd be better off without it. Tell father I will take the next boat home. Now you're talking, honey. Even if you must bring that foreign monkey with you. What did he say? - Nothing. I .. And please tell my father that I'm marrying a perfectly good American. Hartley Madison of New York. Who did you say? Hartley Madison. Well nice going, honey. You certainly hooked a big one. Bring him home. I want to give him a kiss. Hey, wait a minute. Here comes your father now. Hello? Hello? Hello! She hung up on me. That's Miss Carol alright. Chock full of temper ever since she was born. Hello, Frank. I've just been talking to your daughter. Carol? How is she? Well, get yourself set for some great news. That little lady has hooked herself a very wealthy chump. Hooked? - Getting married. No. - To Hartley Madison. You don't say. Not that rich New York fellah? - Nobody else. A sucker in the family! Now we'll go places. We'll have a real breeding farm again. Hundreds of brood mares and bloodied stallions. We'll put Brookvale back on the map, where it belongs. My, my. You said it, Rosetta. Just a minute. Are you fellows calling him a sucker? - Sure. Well, who was it I heard took you for $50,000 once at Belmont? Why Hartley Madison. I thought so. And he's the sucker, eh? Ah, Madison just happened to quit when he was ahead. His old man died I think and he had to take over the business. But if I can only get him back again. Hot dog! I'll help you, Duke. I'll make Carol bring him round. Grandpa, you're a pal. Duke, are you crazy? - Why? Why, a big player like Hartley Madison could wind you up. You or any other bookmaker. Why, he's got a bankroll like the US Treasury. - Frank. Ever since the depression I've been making book for piker bettors. Fifty dollars, a hundred dollars. A thousand dollars, tops. But happy days are here again. Your little girl is bringing home the biggest bettor of all. Well, all I can say is you've got plenty of nerve. Frank, I love you. What did the croaker say, Frank? Did Kenyon send over yet for Miracle Lad? Heck yes, and the Duke here wouldn't let him have him. Wouldn't let him? He's going to fix it up with Ed Kenyon. - No, he's not. Now Frank, this is a matter between grandpa and me. Now there is not going to be any argument. I won't have it. Now dad, you take that horse over to Kenyon. Say, what kind of a son are you, anyhow? I wish you could figure out how to run a breeding farm without a stud. I can't. I'm going out behind the barn to get drunk. Frank. I wish you'd let grandpa keep his stud. No. Thanks a lot, but I owe you too much already. Say, that reminds me. Come in the other room now, will you. You know, Duke. Carol must really like Madison. It can't be his money because nobody knows I'm broke but you. What about the croaker, Frank? Well he scared me a little and says I really got a bum heart. There is nothing wrong with me that a winning bet won't cure. There wouldn't be a thing wrong with you at all if you cut out this fool betting. Get wise to yourself, Frank. You can't beat us bookmakers. The old law of averages will flatten out the biggest bankroll in the country. Well anyway, my bankroll can't take it. This is my last season. Now that Carol is going to be taken care of, I want you to have this. What is it? - Deeds of the farm. Security for the sixty grand I've lost to you. Are you nuts? - Please to take it. Your friendship means more to me than that. You've only known me a bit over a year. - I don't care if it's only for a week. We're pals and you want to give me a mark. Put that thing away. Thanks, Duke. But that's the way it has to be. Will you shut up and behave. - I mean it, Duke. I won't take that and you know it. - Now, I'm not going to argue. Now listen here. The croaker told me not to start hollering at anybody. Here, take it. Alright. - Thanks. If that's the way you want it. A funny thing. After all the big heart specialists I've seen. Nothing seems to regulate the old ticker as well as plain bicarbonate of soda. That's right. Golly Duke, I'm glad the kid is getting away from racetracks. You know, I've always wanted her to be something more than a dressed-up gypsy. Here's too you, kid. 50 dollars across on Jay Bloom. 550 to win, 250 to place and a 150 to show on number 748. Hi, Duke. She finally got here. Hello, grandpa. Who got here? - Carol. - 10 to win on Rester. Yes sir. 60-10 to win on Rester, number 738. Where is Madison? Is he with her? - Sure he is. Take a gander. Oh .. so that's Frank's kid, huh? Well, the sucker is certainly getting his money's worth. Yeah, but she's got so all-fired high and mighty .. You can't understand a word she says. Rusty Gate, 20 to place. Yes, sir. Rusty Gate. 40-20 to place. Number 410. Here Tip, take charge. Come on, grandpa. Front for me. 10 across on Light Fantasy. Light Fantasy. 60-10. 25-10. 12-10. Number 526. - Right. Hello Frank. - Hello Duke. - Hello, Mr Madison. Good to see you again. - How do you do. You remember him: Duke Bradley. I haven't forgotten what you did to me at Belmont once. Oh, of course. Now, I remember. Well, I won some money from you, didn't I? Some money is right. Duke, this is Carol. - How do you do. Charmed, I'm sure. - What did I tell you. I guess you don't remember me, Miss Clayton. - I'm afraid I don't. I talked to you on the phone that day. Duke Bradley? I think you were in some Count's place. Oh. Oh, quite. Congratulations on your engagement. You certainly picked a winner. You know it's good to see a big bettor back on the track, Mr Madison. Thanks. But I'm only a spectator nowadays. The horses are at the gate. Well the track isn't much fun if you don't bet. If you're looking for a future customer, you're wasting your time, Mr Bradley. We have no intention of being around the track. - Not really. We're only here today because of father. Just slumming, huh? Rather comfortable slumming, Mr Clayton. Hello Duke! Hello Fritzi. Why honey, you look as sharp as a razor. Why not. I'm married. - No. Who is the sucker? - Harriet Hale. - Who? Harriet Hale, the big cold-cream and skin man. His real name is Kiffmeyer. - Oh. Plenty of dough, huh? All the government allows. - Honey, I love you. Fritzi, please meet Miss Clayton. - Oh. I'm pleased to know you. How do you do. And how are you, Mr Clayton? - Well .. My ticker has been missing for forty years and I'm alright. I think he's got a horse doctor. What have you bet on, daddy? I have a big bet on Jay Blue. - Come on, Jay Blue. Daddy? What is it, daddy? Hartley, Hartley. - Take it easy. Look honey, will you fetch my bicarbonate. Of course, dad. Fix me a bicarbonate of soda, please. Sure. How are you, Miss Clayton? - Fine, thanks. Don't worry, dear. He'll be alright. He's gotten so gray and feeble, Hartley. - When did you get back, Miss Clayton? Just the other day. You look mighty pretty. - Thanks. Is this for your dad? - Yes. I thought so. It's getting to be quite a habit lately. - Thank you. Keep it. - Thank you. What is it? Well, what is it? Oh, Hartley. Hello? Who? Mr Bradley? Who wants him? Just a minute. Hey, it's Frank Clayton's girl. What? Back in Saratoga? That means the sucker must be with her. Good morning, Carol. How are you? I'm downstairs in the bank, Mr Bradley. Would you be kind enough to come down? "At the bank?" Look Carol, couldn't I meet you somewhere else? "Banks do something to me." I'll only detain you a few minutes. I'm in Mr Kenyon's office. "Kenyon?" That's the granite-faced old buzzard who took grandpa's Miracle Lad. "He never smiles." "When he was born, they had to open his mouth with a chisel." "I couldn't talk to Kenyon. He'd dry me up like a dust storm." Will you come down here please. I'm in a hurry. Well, look Carol. I haven't had any breakfast yet. Couldn't you bring Mr Madison up here? Hello .. hello. It's getting to be a habit of hers, hanging up on me. I never knew a banker to lay a decent bet in my life. You know, it must be something about the market that Frank made me take the farm. Hey, I must dig that up and give it to her. Give it to her? What would you have me do, keep it? She don't need the farm. She'll own half of New York when she marries that chump. Yeah. But grandpa won't. I guess you've blown your topper. Tippy, I love you. Good morning, Mr Bradley. - Good morning, Ernest. Tip. No-one can ever tell me Hartley Madison is through with racing. Why, I can see him now putting down 10, 20, even 50 G's at a clip. Sure sounds sweet. Come in. Good morning, Carol. Good morning, - Well, come in honey. Thank you. Isn't Mr Madison with you? - No, he isn't. Where is he? - He's in Newport. Newport? - Yes. - Not to stay? We are being married there next month. Oh. Then he won't be coming back here? - No. And as I told you before .. If you are planning on Mr Madison as a victim you might as well give it all up. Well, you can't blame me for being ambitious. Will you have some breakfast? - I will not. No? Well, would you mind sitting down while I have mine? I came up here to learn what you intend to do with my father's farm. Do with it? - I .. I hope you won't dispose of it without at least giving me a chance to buy it. Oh .. I see. I assure you I dislike asking favors of you. And my grandfather doesn't know you hold a deed to his property. I know that. Well, it would be a kindness if you don't let him know the truth .. Until I can have Mr Madison pay you off. Is that all, before I reach for a hairbrush? I don't know how to parry wisecracks with you. I fear I have been away from America too long. I'll say you've been away too long. Sit down. I see coming here was a mistake. I'll leave things in the hands of the bank. Just a moment. Come in. Hello Duke. Oh, hello Carol. How do you do. Hello baby. Well honey, we off to look at horses? Fritzi, I must have a talk with Carol. Do you mind if we postpone our trip? Why of course not. I'll see you at the track, Dukey. Fritzi, I love you. Goodbye, Carol. - Goodbye. So you think I'm going to foreclose the mortgage, eh? Now I'm going to tell you what I think of you. I'm not interested in what you think of me. I'll not have the frost put on me by a fellah you roped out of Saratoga .. With clover on her heels and finished up with a bad case swell-head. Why it's taken mean old men working in banks all their lives .. To figure out notions you just fastened on to me. Me, Duke Bradley. One of the boys. Father's friend. Just a moment. My father could have lost to other bookmakers. It seems to me his friendship paid you mighty well. I'll answer that crack by assuring you no matter what other bookmakers do .. I'm not going to oust grandpa because I love the old pest. You can stop worrying about the farm and start springing the trap .. When the sucker is bankrolled. For your information, I'm marrying Hartley Madison because I love him. Carol, this is Duke. You can level with me. I don't know what you say. Don't pretend that Frank's daughter has fallen for a Wall Street chump. A Wall Street chump? Where would you people be if it weren't for the word "chump"? To you it wins any argument. If you call someone a chump, then it proves you?re his superior. You, a fly-by-night bookmaker .. Calling a member of one of the most important families in American a chump. A man who could buy and sell 20 petty gamblers like you with his small change. I suppose you'd marry him if he didn't have a quarter? I'd prefer him that way. Now open that door. Alright. I guess you'd better go ahead and marry the sucker and let him pay me off. That's exactly what I intend to do. You'd better quit kidding yourself about being in love, babe. You know from where I sit a gal that puts the bite on a bridegroom .. For sixty thousand smackers before she even gets him to the altar. Is awfully full of larceny. - What ..? Will you open that door? Sure. Honey, you?re strutting like a pacer. This bay filly before you is lot 45 "Dubonnet". Thoroughbred and registered. Her sire is Giva. One hundred and fifteen thousand dollars. Duke. I'm the most unhappy person in the world. What's the matter? - Dubonnet. The yearling I wanted to buy ever since he was born and my husband isn't here. I got him clear up to the gate but he wouldn't come in. What's the matter? No time? No. He doesn't like horses. They make him sneeze. Did you say "sneeze"? - Yes, sneeze. Hay fever. Oh there he is, the sweetheart. Who, your husband? - No, that colt. Twenty-five hundred. 25 hundred. The gentleman starts right up. 25 hundred. Do I hear 35? Do I hear 35? Oh, there they go. Now don't you worry, honey. Just lead me to Mr Kiffmeyer. And I'll explain to him that Dubonnet is sneeze-less. No, no. Not the two of us together. - Why not? He's jealous. He thinks I'm Cleopatra and every man is in love with me. Well, who says he's wrong? Achoo! Oh! Darling, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine. Mr Bradley. - How do you do. How .. how old? - Oh, darling. There is the horse I was talking about. There is Dubonnet. Look. Achoo! Don't try to change the subject. I said how old? Since I was in the chorus. Oh, there he goes. Well, let him .. go. Look Mr Kiffmeyer. A horse would keep Fritzi from being lonely while you?re away on business. What? Yes. And besides, he'd be good publicity for your cold cream. Well, my horses don't need any cold cream. I mean cold cream doesn't need any .. - We know what you mean, dear. Well you know I can't be around horses. And how do I know what you'll be doing around horses? While I can't be around .. horses. Why, Mr K. Do you mean that? Well, I .. I .. why? Fifty-five. Fifty-five hundred is bid. Now then, do I hear six? Do I hear six? Achoo! Six thousand is bid. Thank you, sir. Whose bid was that, please? Whose bid was that, please? Thank you, sir. Six thousand is bid. Now then, do I hear six-five? Achoo! Gesundheit. Well, you needn't bother. Sold for six thousand. What is the name please? Mr Jessie Kiffmeyer of New York. Here, what are you doing? Sold to Mr Jessie Kiffmeyer of New York. Good work, Mr K. You can't .. we can't .. Achoo! Boys, how long will to take a picture of Mr Kiffmeyer? Why? Never mind. But I'm all out of plates. - That's alright. There he is, boys. The new owner of Dubonnet. You can't bamboozle me into this. - Fix his tie, Fritzi. Let me make you pretty, honey. - I won't buy that horse. Kiffmeyer is his name but he's enthroned by 50 million women as "Harriet Hale". Is that who she is? - The greatest cosmetician in the world. Well "beautician" is the more modern term. Hold up your head, Mr Hale. - Miss Hale. Well, "Kiffmeyer" will do. I beg your pardon, Mr Kiffmeyer. - Yes? Will you please make arrangements with the cashier. I'm not .. Stay here Kiffy, at a good sneezing distance while I go settle for Dubonnet. I'll go help you. - No, wait a minute. I'll take care of your wife. I mean you take care of .. Achoo! Hi. Duke! Hello, grandpa. I wish you'd talk to that girl. I can't do a thing with her. What girl? - Carol. Carol? She's in Newport. - Newport, nothing. She's right over there getting ready to sell Moonray. The last yearling I've got on the place. Don't worry now. I'll go and see what I can do. Good evening, Carol. - Well, good evening. So you didn't go to Newport, huh? No, I'm at Coney Island. Why Carol, that almost sounded like a crack. You think you ought to sell grandpa's colt? I've found I must have some money. Money? I'll pay you off before my marriage. - Pay me off? Not because of that crack I made about you clipping Madison? That had nothing to do with it. I thought things over. That's all. Well, I think you're an awful sucker. If I had a come-on I'd marry him myself. Besides, this yearling won't bring you more than a few thousand dollars. I can run it up to what I owe you. Run it up? On your stocking? - Bet it. You can't beat the old law of averages, Carol. - No? No. Even though you know the track and know about handicapping horses. That's your opinion. What does Mr Madison think about you postponing his wedding? Mr Madison recognises that there is such a thing as integrity. Oh, I see. Say Carol, if you're ready to sell that horse, they're waiting for you. Evening, Miss Clayton. - Good evening. Good evening. Alright, Miss Clayton. Ladies and gentlemen, this yearling colt is Moonray. He was bred at the Brookvale farm and is by our famous sire Dawn Boy. His dam is that great race mare .. Planet Girl. He has been handled and broken since the first of the year. He has a grand disposition and with his royal breeding .. In a capable trainer's hands should develop into a great racehorse. Thank you. You heard what Miss Clayton has said about this colt. Now what is your pleasure, ladies and gentlemen? One thousand dollars. A thousand dollars. Do I hear two? Do I hear two? Ha. A thousand dollars? His tail is worth more than that. Be still, grandpa. What did I ever do to have such a grandchild? A thousand dollars. Cripes. Five thousand dollars. Five thousand is bid. Thank you. Five. Five. Well as I live and breathe it is Hartley Madison. And he went for five grand the first clip. What a beautiful sucker. Here's where you get your stake, honey. - But I don't want .. Look out, Mr Madison. I'm coming into this. Go ahead old boy. - Fifty-five hundred. Six thousand. Sixty-five. What are you doing? Bookmakers can't own horses. I'm going to run the stake in for you, honey. Seventy-five. - Good for you. Eight. Say, you're going rather high on the colt aren't you? Think so? Eighty-five. - Stop it, will you. Oh, let him alone. Nine. Nine thousand is bid. Ninety-five. Ten thousand dollars. I don't want him to be stung for more than fifteen thousand. Oh you're crazy. He'll go for twenty. Ten-five. Don't go over fifteen Duke, please. Eleven. Eleven-five. I must just say hello to Hartley. Eleven-five the gentleman bids. Do you make it twelve? That colt isn't worth that much. Twelve thousand. Hello, sweet. - Hello, darling. Twelve-five. Let him have him at fourteen-five. But why dear? Thirteen. I see larceny in your granddaughter's kisser. You do? Please do as I say. Darling, I'd like to own Moonray. - Won't you do this for me? Of course I'll do this for you. Fourteen thousand. - Now let him have him. Fourteen-five. Mr Madison, you've bought a horse. Swell. - But .. But what, dear? - Don't you see that he was trying .. Don't you want me to have Moonray? Well, of course I do, but .. Well Mr Madison, that was a lot of fun. - Hey, wasn't it. Why did you quit? You know, Carol wanted you to have Moonray. She did? - Yeah. Well now, wasn't that sweet of her. Mr Madison, what are you going to do with that yearling of mine? I know you didn't buy him for yourself. How are you, Mr Clayton? - Alright. What are you going to do with him? I got a birthday coming up this month. Grandpa. - Oh shut up. If you want him well trained, nobody can do it better than grandpa. That's an idea. Would you keep Moonray on at Brookvale and train him for me? Of course he won't. - Why not? Darling, he would be doing me a favor. Will you? Oh here I am ending up as nursemaid to a yearling I don't own. And I ain't even got as stud. I sure could use one. Mr Madison, you think you will do any betting while you?re down this time? I don't know. Perhaps. Mr Madison, will you make arrangements with the cashier, please. Oh yes, of course. Duke, look after Carol for me, will you. - With pleasure. You leave him alone. But Carol, if a man wants to make a few little bets, why can't I .. I told you Mr Madison wasn't betting. Now leave him alone. You know, you're kind of cute. Do you want to take my bets by any chance? Carol, if you only bring a man around the track once in a while .. Do you want to take my bet? - Oh sure. Alright. Weight a hundred and ten pounds. [ Laughter ] I guess that's Miss Fritzi. I guess Mr Duke told her something funny. Will you be still. Look here, honey. You is going to have a nervous breakup working so hard. Belmont, Aquaduct and Maryland. You ain't had a day's rest since we left Saratoga. He's carrying a hundred and fifteen pounds. That means he's picking up five. [ Laughter ] Will you tell Mr Bradley I'd like to see him. I sure will. You got a pencil smudge on your chin, honey. What of it? Don't you want to look pretty for Mr Bradley? Why should I? I would fix up for him anytime. If he was only the right color, I'd marry him. [ Buzzer ] Come in. Good evening, Carol. I didn't know you were on this train. How long are those friends of yours going to keep up that racket? Surely honey, you haven't forgot how the mob acts on a racing special. We're likely to whoop it up all night. Why not join us and have a little fun? I'm afraid I've gotten away from that idea of "fun". Oh .. oh, I see. How are they coming? - I can't complain. No, I should think not. Do you realize you've nicked my books for thirty-seven hundred dollars? Thirty-seven fifty. - No. Why, if this luck of yours keeps up, I'll cut my throat. Oh, it's luck is it? - What do you call it? I'm afraid I call it hard work. Say honey. If it's noisy here you can change with me and take my compartment. No. No thank you. No trouble. I'll move the stuff. - I prefer not. Rosetta. Tell the porter to switch our bags. I sure will. If there's a crap game there, tell the boys to get out. I will. - And don't get in the game. You go on, Mr Duke. Is this everything? - Yes. Excuse me. Hello, Miss Clayton. - Hello, Clipper. Look folks, we've got an Frank's daughter. Good for you. Thanks. Hello, honey. Good evening, Mrs Kiffmeyer. - Hello Fritzi. - Hello, Duke. Hello Miss Clayton. - Hello. You remember "handwriting Hurley"? - Oh. How are you? Gee, Miss Clayton. It's good to see you. - Thanks. I've been thinking about you a lot since .. since your dad went. He thought a lot of you, too. Hurley. I bet she doesn't remember this one. Hello Miss Clayton. Why that's the baby. Little Katy. It's little Katy, but it?s not the baby. Come here .. oh, Pearl. Hello, Miss Clayton. Here is the final edition. Pearl, how you do things. Oh you angel. May I take one. - Of course. Oh Miss Clayton, you've come back home again. Teddy, look out. Duke, take the baby. - Yeah, yeah. Katy, you're going to smother me, honey. Katy, will you be careful and come here and sit down. Hey, take this guy will you. No, Duke. Okay. You're out in front. - Well, here .. Here, take this sucker before I break him. No. You can keep him. I've got another one here. But I didn't want him. Say, I'm doing alright with this guy. Say Duke, I've got to hit you for 5 bucks. You too. What for? - Duggan lost his job. Kick in the green, fellahs. I'd like to get in on that too, sweet. - That's swell. Thanks. Add it for me please. - Okay. Come on fellahs, let's see the green. Hey, Pearl. I think you'd better take this guy. - Oh, of course. Pearl, you'd better take this one too. Will you join in with me? - Too right! [ Singing: ] "Lend me your ear and I'll tell you a tale." "It's the tale of a horse and a frail." "Who went boom ti-di ad-da-da da-da-da boom ti-di eh." "With a boom ti-di ad-da-da da-da-da boom ti-di eh." "It's the story of trouble and woe." "And the loss of a big pile of dough."

Go on. - Oh, alright. "So you know why I'm feeling forlorn." "I've been broke since the day I was born." "I went boom ti-di ad-da-da boom da-da-da ti-di eh." "Boom ti-di ad-da-da da-da-da ti-di eh." "And the reason I'm in such a fix." "Is that men and horses don't mix." "Take a tip and beware girls, if you recognise." "The horse with the dreamy eyes." "He went boom ti-di ad-da-da da-da-da ti-di oh." "The horse with the dreamy eyes." We want Preston. "If they ever discover .." I guess I'd better be going. Goodnight. Wait a minute. I'll go with you. Now you can work to your heart's content. The gang won't disturb you in here. You think I'm an awful snob, don't you. No, I wouldn't say that. - I know you do. There are really other things in the world beside racetracks. Well yes, I suppose there are. You've never been to Europe, have you? - Nope. You should see England sometime. You mean Ascot, Epsom Downs, Newmarket? They must be swell. No. I wasn't thinking about racetracks. Oh no. That's right. You ought to see one of those big English country houses .. Where one family has carried on for centuries. You know, traditions of sportsmanship .. Honour handed down from father to son. Oh yeah, like a line of thoroughbreds, huh? Well, yes. Did you ever look at an old painting and know just what the artist .. Wanted you to feel when he painted it 400 years ago? No, I never did. - Well I learned all of those things. You know what you'd like? Punting on the Thames. With the oaks making a green roof and the sky coming through. Hey, I did punt once when I was a kid. In a mud scow on the Ohio. There is some many things to do in the world. So many things to see. And so many wonderful people to meet. You know Carol, I never got you before. I begin to see what you're driving at. You are? - Yeah. I believe I'd go for those things myself in a big way if I wasn't such a mug. You're not a mug. You've got brains, looks, personality .. Will you quit your kidding. - I'm not kidding. Gee honey, it kinda gives me a lift to know you feel that way. I'm all for you getting the things you want. Thanks. I'm glad you understand. I do, but you never put it to me straight like that before. I know. I'm sorry. Say look. I've got an idea that will put us both closer to punting on the Thames. You have? - Yeah. - What is it? When you get to Florida, where will you stay? The Park Central. Well go on, Duke. Well, when we get there .. you phone Madison and have him come down. Now all you have to do is to say the word and he'll come running. Then. Let him do a little betting with me. I'll cut you in for 20% of my winnings. And gee honey, you'll have that market paid off in no time at all. Get out of here. What? - I said get out of here. Why, what's the matter? Nothing, except that I thought you had a grain of decency. Tell me child, what is the matter? I never want to see that cheap, swell-headed .. Smart-aleck bookmaker again as long as I live. Oh Miss Carol. Why, honey. Baby. Just a minute, please. - Hello, Mr Madison. Hello Bradley. Why are you in New York? - I came to see you. Really? - Yes. This place is tougher to crash than the pearly gates. Duke, will you excuse me just a minute? - Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Where was I? "If they could be procured on a satisfactory basis .." I am willing to pay 101 net to me for a commitment up to a million and a half. Kindly advise me regarding this immediately. Yours, etc. That's all. Shall we do any of that new government issue, Mr Madison? I'll see about that later on. - Yes, sir. Now what can I do for you, Duke? Well. It's about Carol. Carol? What's wrong? Carol needs you, Mr Madison. She's not well. No? Why, I spoke to her last night in Baltimore before she left for Florida. Did she seem alright? She didn't say anything about not being. - She didn't seem nervous, irritable? Well, not that you mention it, yes she did. Yes, yes. You know, Carol is not her old self at all. Has she seen a doctor? - No. No she hasn't and she's just a bundle of nerves. Why, do you know that last night on the train I tried to make her send for you. And believe it or not she ordered me out of the compartment. She did? - Yes. Flew into a rage. That's bad, Duke. That's very bad. Yes. She takes this job of hers too seriously. I'm afraid she is. I think you ought to go to Florida and talk with her. Well, maybe you are right. Yes. With you there to bounce around the track and help her pick those winners .. I'll go, Duke. I'll go right away and .. And say, I'll take Dr Bierd with me. That's what I'll do. He'll find out what's the matter. Hello, get me Dr Bierd on the phone. Dr Harmsworth Bierd. - Now look, Mr Madison. You needn't do that. There's plenty of good doctors down there. Nobody like Bierd. He's the best nerve specialist this side of Vienna. Yes, I know. But a big doctor like that, he might upset her terribly. But at least he'll find out what's the matter. Hello? Hello Dr Bierd, can you fly to Florida with me right away? Now look, Mr Madison, I don't think .. We are going today. It is for my fianc?e. It's a bad case of nerves and I want you to look her over. Well, we're leaving from Roosevelt Field in a couple of hours. Uhuh. Alright, I'll pick you up. Goodbye. May I assist you, Miss Washington? Thank you, Mr Meyers. Why, Miss Carol, there is Mr Madison. Don't be silly, Rosetta. Mr Madison is in New York. Carol! Darling. - Hello, honey. Why sweetheart, what's the matter? - What are you doing down here? Darling, Duke said you weren't feeling quite up to scratch. - Oh, he did? See, I had to go back to New York on business. So, naturally I dropped in to see Hartley and .. Well, here we are. Thought I'd help you pick some winners. - I don't need any help. Why Carol, of course you don't. And darling, it's .. Oh, Dr Bierd. Oh yes. Dr Bierd just happened to be coming down too. This is Miss Clayton, Dr Bierd. Oh yes, yes. How do you do, my dear? - How do you do. I thought Dr Bierd could look you over. What for? What is the meaning of this? You see, Hartley was very worried .. - What are you talking about? Now don't get excited. - Who's excited? Nobody. I'm sorry if I upset you. I'm not upset, but let's get out of here. Carol. Carol. Haven't you forgotten something? What? Oh well, go ahead dear. Don't mind us. Of course not. Of course not, what? You haven't kissed Hartley hello. Aren't you glad to see him? - What do you think? This is absolutely ridiculous, doctor. I said there's nothing the matter with me. Quiet now. Just relax. Miss Clayton, when was your wedding originally planned? Last August. - That's five months ago. Dear, dear, dear, dear. There is nothing organically wrong with that little heart. But it's beating much, much too fast. I told you I was alright. Of course. But you are a highly emotional type. What are you drivelling about? You are a woman who's entire system is regulated by her emotions. You should be married now. And cooing contentedly in your own dear little nest. What? And now I want you to take a soothing lukewarm effervescent bath. I will send you a masseuse who will give you a light gentle massage. And then in this quiet, darkened room you can have a restful, peaceful nap. I've let you spoil my day at the track. But I won't take a warm, dark effervescent nap for you or anyone else. Dear, dear, dear. Mr Madison should never have come down. Neither should you. - Now, now. My dear child. There is nothing wrong with me. I am perfectly normal. That's just it. Entirely too normal. I suggest you see as little as possible of your fianc?e until you are married. And I hope I may soon have the pleasure of an invitation to that wedding. Goodbye. Bless your heart. Hey ho. What is it? - Oh, it's nothing, really. Are you alright, darling? What's happened? It's just nerves. You see, she's .. Would you excuse us? - Yes. What did you find? Is it serious? - Yes. But it's no case for a doctor. Well, what is it? "Amor solum a medicina sanari non posse." What does that mean? It means that love cannot be cured by pills. Love? Why .. You mean ..? - Uhuh. Why, the poor little darling. - Yes. She ought not to see too much of you. - Alright. We make it as easy for her as possible. - Oh yes. Yes, of course. I'll see you before I leave. - Alright. Thanks. You are a very lucky man. - Hmm. Goodbye, Mr Bradley. - Goodbye, doctor. [ Radio: ] "19 horses are lined up." This is the race that Carol is on. - Is it really? - Hmm. Rosetta. Want a hot tip? Yes sir, Mr Duke. Give me something I can hope for. Ski Ball. 3-1. I got it right from the horse himself. Won't them other horses be surprised? I'm going to bet two bucks on him. Oh, make it five. - Alright, Mr Duke. I'll make it ten. Ski Ball? That's Carol's one isn't it? - Uhuh. Want a bet? No, I don't think so. Oh, why not do it for Carol? Speed up that wedding date. They've started. Invite me to the wedding and I'll take it. "At the turn it's Ski Ball by a length." - Look at that Ski Ball go! Man, look at her go. And the odds on Ski Ball now? - 3-1. - Still 3-1? It's what I offered. How about a thousand dollars? - Make it two. Alright. You're on. - My, oh my. Come in. Will you want me again, Mr Madison? No, that's all today. Come on, Ski Ball. Come on. "At the three quarters, it's Ski Ball by four lengths." "Mink Coat is second by a head." Where is Gloria Kay? She ain't even mentioned. - Where is Rocket? Left at the post. Were you on Rocket? - Yes. Too bad. I could have given you Ski Ball. Come on. Come on, Ski Ball. Come on! Come on! - Come on Ski Ball. "It's Ski Ball by five lengths." Yo! Ain't that Ski Ball a sweetheart? My, oh my .. Did you lose much, Boswell? - Two dollars, sir. That's too bad. Here you are, Rosie. Thank you, Mr Duke. It's just like you made us a present. I'll give you a check, Hartley. - That's alright, Duke. Oh, hello honey. When did you come in? I came in with Ski Ball. One touch of horse flesh makes the whole world, kid. Darling, I won six thousand dollars on Ski Ball. Well isn't that fine. - Yes, the man is a wizard. For your fund. We are six thousand dollars nearer our wedding day. I can't do that, Hartley. - Why, darling .. Now honey, you're spoiling half of Hartley's fun. Please! I've got to do this myself. You know that. Alright, darling. Just as you say. Duke .. it's been a long time since Hartley and I have seen each other. Do you mind? Oh no. No, of course not. Thanks, Duke. Hartley, when you going to pick a new winner? Oh, I'll make some selections in the morning. Why don't we all have luncheon together on the patio and go to the track later? That's fine. You know, I think Florida is going to do us all some good. Be careful you don't get sun-struck. Isn't she cute? Hartley. I don't want you betting with that fellow. Why not? - Because .. Because, can you see what he's trying to do? He's trying to get you to start betting again. But sweetheart, Duke always lost to me. Look what I did to him today. - That doesn't matter. You don't belong to the track. What do you know about handicapping horses? It's all simply a .. - Carol, wait. What you are trying to tell me is .. Well. Is that .. that you want me to go, isn't it? Yes. Well, I understand, sweetheart. It's alright. Understand what? Why you want me to go. You see, Dr Bierd explained it to me. Dr Bierd? - Uhuh. Dr Bierd ..? But darling, there is nothing to be ashamed of. The chump with the dreamy eyes. "He'll go boom ti-di ad-da-da da-da-da boom ti-di eh." What do you think you're doing? - Getting the odds ready for Hartley. Yeah, that was a great idea of yours. Giving him 3-1 on Ski Ball today. I think so. Do you know that Ski Ball was a 10-7 shot? Why you're the meanest man I ever saw. Denying a poor little sucker his bait. Did you say "sucker"? The trouble with you is you don't know how to deal with the big time operators. Why, in ten days we'll be rolling in dough. Yes, and in thirty minutes he'll be rolling off the flying field. His bags are down on the side-walk now. What? He's leaving for New York. And he took you for six G's. If he's a sucker, I'm a goldfish. Where you going, chump? [ Buzzer ] Is that you, Rosetta? - Yes, ma'am. It's me. Well, come in. Well. It's Bradley. Fancy seeing you here. So you sent him away, huh? - Of course I did. You didn't think I'd let him stay? - Why you double-crosser. Hello. Hello. Get me room 218. Nice weather for Hartley's flight. Hello, Tip? Pack me a bag right away. I'm catching a plane with Madison. Yeah. Okay. That will do you a lot of good. - All we need is a radio. You've been to Hartley's office, haven't you? - Yep. And of course, he'll just drop everything. What do his financial transactions amount to? He'll disregard the stock market and .. Simply devote his time to listening to the radio with you. Look Carol, won't you let me have him for just ten days? I think you'd better go now. Hartley phoned and he's coming to say goodbye. Well, what of it? He won't like you if he finds you here. No. That wouldn't look so good for you either, would it? I'll explain: you forced your way in. [ Door knocks ] Wait a minute. What are you doing? If you're so good at explaining, explain this. Will you come out of there, Duke. - If I were you, I'd ask him to stay. Hartley might not like it if I happen to make some noise. [ Door knocks ] Duke. Please. Please. Will you come out of there. [ Door knocks ] Carol, I haven't much time, sweet. Is that you dear? Come in. Hello, sweet. I am sorry. I was too sore. No, no. Don't get up. I've only time to kiss you goodbye. Darling, it's been wonderful being with you. And I do hope that you will feel .. Is there ..? Sweetheart. Well, what is it, Hartley? When did you ..? When did you ..? When did I what? When did you start smoking cigars? Oh, I just picked it up. I am trying to obey doctor's orders. He said .. No more cigarettes. But dear, you'll make yourself ill. Yes. Well, I've got to do something for my nerves. I know darling, but cigars? And that's a strong one. I know. I .. I won't smoke it anymore if you don't want me to, Hartley. You poor darling. I'm so worried about you. But you mustn't worry about me. What is it, sweet? Hartley. I wish you'd stay in Florida. You do, dear? - Yes. Well, darling, I'd only be too happy to stay. That is .. well .. If you are sure my being here wouldn't upset you. Why, of course it wouldn't upset me. I want you to stay. But you said this afternoon .. - Yes. I know. But I'm nervous. Sometimes .. I want you to go and sometimes I want you to stay. Right now I want you to stay. - I know. What difference if I am nervous? What difference if I am a little upset? I want you stay. Don't you see, darling? I couldn't do that. You are too considerate, Hartley. You always think of everybody but yourself. Why shouldn't you have a holiday? Darling, I am going to go. Please. - No. Please, Hartley. - No more. You mustn't go. You can't go. I won't let you. Darling, we settled all that this afternoon. Now please calm yourself. And believe me darling, I know what's best. Alright .. whatever you say. Goodbye, sweet. Bless your little heart. You will go straight to bed now won't you, darling. And please don't smoke any more of those things. I won't. I'll phone when I get to New York. Goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. Why, the man is an iceberg. Now I've got to steam him up all over again. I hope you weren't too uncomfortable. Well it was pretty warm until you smoked that cigar. I'll send you a box sometime. Oh but baby, how you went to town for Dukey. You idiot. I did the one thing that would send him away. You did? What was that? - I kissed him. And that sent him away? Oh Carol, you underestimate yourself. You don't understand. Hartley happens to be a gentleman. Oh. Then I'm glad I'm a mug. Kiss me like that and see if I go home. Well .. You don't think that I tried to make him stay here for you, do you? Oh no, no. Of course not. Why, I never dreamed of it. I sent him away. - Yeah. You don't believe me, do you? - Sure, sure. I believe you. Didn't I hear it? He went because the doctor told him that I was .. The doctor told him that you were what? - That I was .. Nothing. Will you please leave? Honey. I love you. You and your sucker, huh? We'll trail him to New York. I'll bet you all I've got against a quarter .. That we get him back. Yeah. Just like your girlfriend got him to stay here for you. Carol tried to get him to stay. She went to town for me like a little champion. She did, huh? She double-crossed you like a 6th Avenue girl. And you thought you were shoving her around. Ha! What a ladies' man. What a ladies' man. Hello Duke. Will you say that again? - Say what? Well, is it really you? - Surprised, are you? Well no, not exactly. Sit down. - Thanks. Carol fairly insisted on my staying. She stopped me at the airport. She did? - Yeah. Well, bless her little heart. Meet Carol's fianc?e. This is my sheet writer. How do you do. - I'm certainly pleased to meet you. Thanks .. say Duke, there is horse Carol likes today: Rester. Rester? - Yes. Did you say "Rester"? - Uhuh. - And Carol likes him? Yeah. Well he's in this next race. They are at the post now. Oh is he? What price can you give me? 7-1. - 7-1? How about five thousand? - Hartley, you got a bet. Where's the lady? She's a headache. She's staying in her room. Oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry. Come on, Rester. Come on, Rester! Say .. where is Rester now? I'm afraid he's running a bad third. Yes. I am afraid. Come on. Rester seems to be falling behind. Slightly. Yes, he's now running a deep last. - Carol must have had a headache. Yes, she must have. Well, he'll be home in time for dinner. Anyway, it took eight horses to beat him. That's right. Well, I've got to get back to the hotel and see Carol. Give her my love. - Thanks. I'll give you a check tonight, Duke. - Alright. Put it on tomorrow's bet. Thanks. See you later, boys. - So long. Well, I've certainly got to hand it to you. Is he worthwhile waiting for. But .. why did she ever pick Rester? Why do you think? - Huh? [ Whistle ] Dukey, I love you. Morning, Mr Bradley. - Morning. - One? Hello, Duke. How are things at Huntingdon Downs? - Okay. No, never mind. Well this is luck. Good morning, honey. How are you? Duke. Oh madam, you look broad-minded. I've loved this woman for years. You're lucky. Mine only lasted two days. Duke, you remember my husband? Oh yes. Brother Kiffmeyer. How do you do? How do you do. - I didn't know you were on the train. No, that's quite obvious. Would you mind dropping my wife's hand? Where would I drop it? Out the window? - Don't try to laugh your way out of it. Madam, I ask you. Is there anything wrong with this? I wish she'd change places with me. - There. You see? There you see. You were so afraid my wife would be lonely if I didn't buy her horses. Well, I bought her horses. And now I wonder whether she's around the country with horses or whether .. She's around the horses with you. You heard what she said. Madam, would you rather be around horses or would .. or would ..? Mister, I'm afraid you don't understand us women. I? I don't understand women? Madam. Do you know who I am? I haven't the slightest idea. - Yes. Well, I'm Harriet Hale. Not he beauty queen? Exactly, and now Mr Bradley. If you would .. Can you say why your foundation cream always cakes when you put on powder? Cakes? My cream cakes? Madam, you don't know how to apply it. And madam, here for you .. - I'd say you don't know how to make it. Madam. Harriet Hale's foundation cream. Has been the basis for women's beauty for twenty years. Now Mr Bradley, I just want .. - Kiffy please. Well just a moment. - So how do you apply it? With a circular motion. Don't you read the directions? I tried that. Yes. Well from now on madam, your face is in your own hands. That's a fine way to talk to your public. Well I .. yes, well I'm sorry. I was distraught. Yes. I distraught him. You keep out of this. If you come to my compartment, madam, I will show you how to apply it. May I watch? If you so much as speak to your wife .. I mean .. his wife. We know whose wife you mean, darling. Well just .. Mr Hale, you'll never know how my face looked before I used your preparation. Yes, well I can imagine. All I want to say to you, Mr Bradley is .. I don't fool you for a minute. I mean you don't fool .. You're a pernicious influence. Oh Kiffy, why don't you show the lady how to use the cream? Oh, so you want to get rid of me. That's it, is it? Alright. I'll see you in the compartment. And alone. Do you think he can do my face any good? Well, look at me madam. And I'm forty-five years old. Why, you don't look twenty-five. Well, that's what Harriet Hale has done for me. What's the number of Mr Hale's compartment? 6B. Car 51. Thank you. I'll leave the door open. Thanks. Poor Kiffy. Isn't he an old darling. The salt of the earth. If he just wasn't so jealous. Not only that. You know. He's a pretty smart guy when he's away from the track. A lot smarter than I'd be. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning, Rosetta. How is Miss Carol? - That cold she caught is worse. It is? - Yes, Mr Duke. I came to get her some more juice so she can take some castor oil .. But I know she won't take it. - Yes she will. You hustle up the orange juice. Bring me some too. Yes, sir. I'd say it's tough on a kid .. Knocking around the country all alone trying to beat the ponies. Yes. You're in love with her Duke, aren't you? Who? - Carol. What makes you think so? Oh, I've been around the block. I knew it before you did. No you didn't. I knew it the first time I took a hinge at her. Why don't you tell her so? Well Fritzi, Carol's father was my best friend. The last thing he ever said to me was he wanted her to get away from this racket. To be something better than a dressed-up gypsy. I can't ask her to leave what Madison can give her .. Just to knock around a racetrack with me. If she loved you, she'd be happy sleeping in a barn. - No, Fritzi. I haven't enough dough to fix Brookvale up the way it was for her and grandpa. And to sure that it would always be kept that way. You know, security. And I expect to get it from Mr Madison. Madison is going to make you and Carol comfortable? And grandpa. Why, you magnificent so and so. Fritzi, I love you. I'll go and give her that medicine. Who is it? - It's Duke. Just a minute. What's the matter, honey? - I'm not dressed. Well, put on something. I don't look good in "something". Well then, put on "anything". You could be dressed for the Arctic by now. Come in. Good morning, honey. How are you feeling? - I'm fine. Say, you look great in that Kimono. Thanks, but it's a negligee. Well, what did you want, Duke? - What? Oh, I came to doctor that cold of yours. Hey, you've got a fever. - No, it's warm in here. That's all. Oh yeah? Well, I think you'd better get into this bed. Were you in this horse blanket when I knocked just now? Yes. Rosetta brought it for me. Alright. You get right back into it. I know you're pretty. - But I .. Come on, now. Get in this bed. This is more work that I've done for a woman since my mother. You got any goose grease-around here? - There is something in that case there. But I don't need anything, Duke. Hey, that's a pretty swell layout. Everything but a pipe. A present from Hartley? - Yes. Isn't that just like him. Thoughtful until the last detail. I don't want that. It smells. - Alright then. Hold your nose. Did Kiffy and Fritzi make the train? - Sure. I just left them. Oh you did? Are you in love with her, Duke? With Fritzi? How you talk. Well, Kiffy thinks you are. Did he tell you that, too? Isn't he cute, the old sweetheart. Only me and fifty others. Roll over. - No. I don't want to. Come on, roll over. - Oh Duke. What's the matter? Oh, I was thinking about that night in Miami. When you tried to smoke my cigar? - If I live to be a thousand .. I'll never forget the way you looked coming out from underneath that couch. Lie still, will you. Lie still. Okay, will you lie still. What's the matter? Here. You alright? Yes. I'm alright now. You had me scared there for a minute. Hey, Duke. Yeah. What is it honey? I love you, Duke. Say, what are you trying to do? Steal my gag line? Isn't it about time we quit kidding ourselves. Kidding ourselves? - Yes. I've just been riding Hartley. Breaking our engagement. You what? It's all over. I never want to see him again. You never want to see him again? - No, I'm breaking it all off. Great guns, honey. He'll be coming down to Kentucky. You can't do that to me. What? I can't do what to you? - Take my chump out of circulation. I can't ..? I can't do it to you? Well how do you like that. - What's the matter? I see what I've been to you. Just a come on, a steer girl. Will you talk sense. Stop dramatizing. - A steer girl, just a steer girl. There you see. Now get back under those covers. You get out of my room. You get back under those covers. What are you trying to do? Catch pneumonia. Here, take this. - It's the wrong one. I will not. - Take it. Alright. Now, that's a fine thing to do. And to think I nearly let him go. A man. A real man. That's just what I was telling you. The most beautiful man in the world. Oh he is, eh? Alright, I'll get him for you. You will? I'll get him for you in Kentucky. - Honey, now you're talking. I'll handicap for him .. And he'll wind you up on a street corner with a tin cup in your hand. Thank you, honey. And here's luck. My, my. Dixie Gordon has grabbed the lead and he's riding pretty. Looks like you made a bad bet, Hartley. - Hurley's passed him though. When Gordon gets out in front he's hard to catch. Hurley is riding the best horse though. That's why Carol picked him. Hurley is moving up. Come on! Hurley is giving him his head. He will pass Gordon at the turn. Want to double your bet? I'll give you four to one now. Huh? - 4-1. Take it. Okay. - You're on. Gordon is sure giving your horse a ride. - He certainly is. Try it on the outside, Hurley. - I've got the right of way. Stay back or I'll put you into the fence. Who went down? - Hurley. Hurley? That's done it. The little fellow is alright, honey. Just shaken up a bit, that's all. Can you beat that Dixie coming home on a nag that couldn't pull a laundry wagon. Duke .. Duke! Fritzi. Did you see Dixie ride? And I have him. I got him on contract for The Hopeful. What? - Yeah. Then The Hopeful is in your pocket, Fritzi. - I love you. Wait a minute. I want you all to witness that I've ordered this man to keep .. Achoo! It's alright. Don't apologise. - I'm not apologising to you. You keep away from my wife. That's all I'm telling you now or .. Kiffy, look out. Achoo! You've got the horses doing it. Don't you try to laugh your way out of this. I can't stay around horses. Come on. You'd better watch out, Duke. Do you mind, dear? Let's go. - Right, darling. See you at the hotel. Fine. Too bad you lost today. Better luck next time. Thank you, honey. - What for? For getting Hartley to double his bet. What did you want to make her mad for? Well, the madder she gets, the more she'll make him bet. And the worse she'll handicap him. Hey, son. - Yes? Coke? No, no. I just want one of these cups. Take her this and tell her I'm sorry it isn't tin. Thank you. Oh, Carol. Duke asked me to give you this and tell you he's sorry it isn't tin. My, my. Oh Miss Carol, here is some more tin cups from Mr Duke. Throw them out. - All of them? Throw them out. - Yes, ma'am. Does you want to hear the note? - No. Well it says: "Remember Dukey". Ain't he the tease? He teases me about my complexion. And he teases you about Mr Madison losing all that money. And he teases Mr Kiffmeyer about his wife. He's always teasing somebody. But nobody gets mad except you and Mr Kiffmeyer. Get me the United States Hotel. These cups is just what I need to put my knickknacks in. Throw them things in the ash-can. Get Mr Kiffmeyer. Mr Jesse Kiffmeyer. Can't I have just one to remember him by? Throw those things in the ash-can. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yes, this is .. oh, Miss Clayton. Yes, of course Dixie Gordon's contract is in my name. You see, my financial responsibility .. Oh. My wife and that Bradley? Yes. Well, I'd do anything. I mean .. Almost anything. You do? Oh, you don't. Oh you do? Oh. You don't. Well I mean .. You do. Yes, you can have the contract. You can have the horse if you want to. Well, just hold the phone. I'll see if it's here. Just .. one moment please. [ Singing: ] "It has a lucky new swing." "Saratoga." "But it's a dangerous thing." "Saratoga." "Dames from Who's Who." "With the lads."

Here is to the greatest two-year old in the world. Hartley, what's his name? - Moonray. What a charming name. Gentlemen, I give you Moonray. I say Hartley, a racing chap up at the hotel .. Has given me Dubonnet to win on account of his jockey. Dixie Gordon is the best money riding jockey on the turf. But Moonray is a great horse. And horses have a little bit to do with racing you know. Hartley, I'm afraid you prejudiced. Maybe, but I think my horse is going to win. And I'm backing .. Ah, of course .. Carol doesn't agree with me but I'm backing him nevertheless. Excuse me, gentlemen. Shall we dance, darling? Why do you aggravate me like this? Wait a minute, Carol. I've lost a lot of money on your handicapping. If I want to bet on my horse it's my risk. But why do you want to bet tonight? By race time tomorrow, Duke's odds might change. Hello there, you two love-birds. - Hello, Steve. Keep right on. We don't want to interfere with romance. Thank you. I tell you Moonray can't win tomorrow with Dixie Gordon on Dubonnet. That's your opinion, but my new trainer thinks he can. Your new trainer is trying to keep his job. He can't do any more for Moonray than grandpa did. You're darn tooting. Putting a newfangled trainer on Moonray. Why, I raised him on the bottle from the time he was four. And nursed him through that bad sickness in September. We know that, grandpa. His sire had distemper twice in '31. And his granddaddy had a quarter crack a month before The Preakness. And I cured them both. Did you know that? - Yes. You told me that Mr Clayton. Yeah. Well, they was both champions. Moonray will be a champion, too. Go and take him away from me just before The Hopeful when he needs me the most. I've been just like a father to him. - Oh, please, grandpa. Moonray ain't going to fold up tomorrow. I got him ready. He's a fit horse. And he'll win. He ain't going to forget nothing I told him. Grandpa, why are you taking your shoes off? I'm taking them off so I won't kick that new trainer of yours. That isn't funny, grandpa. - You ain't funny either. And he's blowed his topper. Shall we go inside? - Yes, Hartley. Goodnight. Confound this halter. Household full of Newport chumps. Nothing in the stable but dry rot. A new trainer. My dogs hurt. Hey .. who are you? Shush. Please, I'm a .. Are you the caretaker here? - Caretaker? Why you infernal jackass. My grandfather built this dump. Oh, well I'm very sorry. I want to see Miss Clayton. What about? Well it's .. it's something personal. Very Private? Private? Why you old fool. You're old enough to be her father. What do you mean? Are you insinuating? Why, I am a married man. I wonder. - Here you is, Mr Clayton. Would you tell Miss Clayton I would like to see her at once? It's very important. Yes, sir. Come right in. - No, ask her to come out here please. Yes, sir. You know, I don't know what it is .. But there is something about you I don't like. Oh. Well if you feel that way, I must say I don't like you very much either. Hello, Mr Kiffmeyer. Miss Clayton, I wanted .. Grandpa, do you mind? Do I mind what? It? I'm going down to the barn where it don't smell. Do you think that we'd better ..? Well how about it? Well, it's a great idea, but do you .. Think that I am doing the right thing? Is Duke Bradley doing the right thing to you? No. But are you sure that your horse will win if that Dixie Gordon rides him? I'll be my farm on it. And will Mr Madison make a large bet with that Bradley? Big enough to break him. Yes. Well, that's all I want to know. Here it is. She tells me she doesn't care for him .. But I can't believe a word she says now she's been running around with horses. You have to sign this over to me, Mr Kiffmeyer. Oh, yes. But suppose that Bradley finds out and won't take the bet? He can't find out unless you tell him. Don't tell the jockey until tomorrow. Now, sign right here. Yes, well. Alright. I've been trying to place this guy. Do you know who he is? His wife owns Dubonnet. Go along, grandpa. - He's up to something. Look at him. He's as guilty as a horse thief. Now look here, Mr Clayton, you can't .. Will you desist. First of all he calls me a caretaker, then tells me to "desist". Get off this place! - Now look here, grandpa. Don't you call me grandpa. - Will you leave us alone one minute. Alright. But I don't trust that guy. A house full of monkeys and no stud. I don't .. Now hurry up before we're interfered with again. Yes. I hope this .. Puts that Bradley where he belongs. - So do I. Yes, and I hope that nobody will know I've been here. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hello? Saratoga 1-5-5-8. Darling, do you think this is quite right? Quite right? Carol, have you and Duke had a quarrel? A quarrel? With that bookmaker? I don't know. You get so violent about the man I can't help thinking that .. Hello? Let me speak with Mr Bradley. Mr Duke Bradley. Please. Has there been anything between you two? You're out of your mind. Hello? Hello, Duke? I'd like to place a bet on Moonray in tomorrow's Hopeful. Did you say Moonray? Well how about me coming out and talk it over with you? I've nothing to do. Sure, I'll be right over. Goodbye. Well, cross your fingers. Brother Madison? - Yeah. I thought I'd lost him. But he's gone sentimental. - He's going to back his own nag? You know how a sucker goes when he falls in love with his own horse. Fritzi, if luck is with me, this closes my book for good. You wouldn't quit the track? Why not? That leaves me a lone gypsy. Honey, I love you. So long. - Good luck, Duke. How are you, Dixie? - Hello, Duke. Hey listen you little mug. You'd better give that Dubonnet a ride tomorrow. Duke my boy, cracks like that annoy me. I wish I had your humility. Hello, Mr Bradley. How are you this evening? Fine, fine. What's the matter with you? Oh, nothing is the matter with me. I'm quite alright. Give me a brandy, please. Better make it a double brandy. Oh, Kiffy. Hello, darling. Well. It's good to see you alone for a change. Are you going to start that again? Yes, but you haven't been alone long. I just saw your boyfriend leaving. May I sit down? Oh look, darling, are you going to stop that silly nonsense. Well, maybe. Kiffy, darling. - Yes? Duke has given me something to think about. He has? - Yes. He may leave the track after tomorrow. Yes, that's right. He may. What do you mean by that? Well I mean, that's what you just said. Oh, yes. He's been in love with Carol Clayton for a year. But he wouldn't ask her to marry him because .. Well, he didn't feel that he could do as much for her as Madison can. But if Duke wins enough money tomorrow, he's going to tell her. He's ..? You mean he's ..? Duke? Oh. Oh, barman. Get me another .. double brandy. Kiffy, isn't that an awful lot? Well, I'm, I'm .. I am very distressed. Oh, darling. You know. Duke has made me realize how selfish I've been. Dubonnet is in the pink and I'm going to win The Hopeful tomorrow .. And have my hour of triumph, but .. Win, lose or draw, darling. I'm going to quit the track for you. Muggins, darling. I .. Yes, dear? Well, there is something you ought .. Well, what is it? Darling? Hello. Oh, I told you. You shouldn't drink all that. Oh, Muggins darling, I've .. Done something terrible. What is it? - Oh .. Get me another double. Bring me the bottle. Kiffy. Please don't be angry with me. Well Kiffy, what is it? Well .. I've given Miss Clayton. Dixie Gordon's contract. What? - Yes. Isn't that awful? He is going to ride Moonray tomorrow. Will you get me the Brookvale Farm, and hurry please. Say look, this is .. Hello? Hello, Brookvale? Has Mr Bradley arrived there? No ma'am, he ain't come yet. Yes ma'am, I'll tell him just as soon as he comes. Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Sam. Good evening, Mr Duke. Hello Rosetta. Mrs Kiffmeyer just phoned and wants you to phone her right away. I'll call her later. Will you tell Mr Madison I'm here. Yes, sir. Go right in the lobby and I'll tell him. Evening, Duke. - Evening, Hartley. Nice of you to come out. - It's a pleasure. Where is Carol? She is busy with our guests. She asked to be excused. Do you mind if we get down to cases? - No, of course not. Duke, what price can you give me on Moonray tomorrow? Well .. let's see. Well, twelve horses in the race .. uh .. I think I can give you 2-1, Hartley. That's good with me. - How much do you want? You're quite a cigar smoker aren't you Duke. Yeah, why? - Oh, nothing. How much do you want on Moonray? - Fifty thousand dollars. Okay. Sure you don't want any more? What's the most you could cover, Duke? Well let's see. I just figured .. You know, this is a beautiful spot here, Hartley. A few thousand dollars would make it the prettiest place in the world. A new barn stocked with thoroughbreds. I asked you what's the most you could cover, Duke. Would you like to make it a hundred thousand? Is that all you can pay off on? - It's all I want, pal. Okay. Mr Duke. Mrs Fritzi Kiffmeyer is on the phone again and says she's got to talk to you. Thanks, Rosetta. Will you excuse me, Hartley? Yeah. Rosetta. You've been around Mr Bradley a good deal, haven't you. Oh my yes. All I could. He certainly smokes strong, cigars doesn't he. Yes sir, Mr Madison. And he leaves them around all over the place. Yeah. All over the country. Did I make a bet? The sucker just went for a hundred G's. You heard me. A hundred thousand bucks. What? Say that again. Dixie Gordon is riding Moonray? What do you mean? I thought you had him under contract. Oh. Oh, Carol arranged the switch, huh? Well, it looks like I'll be leaving Saratoga on a boxcar. Call it off? No Fritzi, I said yes to the chump. Yeah. Okay, babe. I love you. Well Hartley, I'll be running along. - Won't you have a drink before you go? No thanks. I've got to help Fritzi dig up another jockey to ride Dubonnet tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight. Tell Carol I took this. I may be sitting on a street corner after The Hopeful tomorrow. How is he, Medbury? - Fine. Raised him a half this morning. He's a lot of horse today. They'll have to beat him to win. - Good. Dixie. I've got a big bet on this race. There will be five thousand extra if you win. Well, you can make out your check right now. I hope you lose. You double-crossing Newport termite. I'll see you after the race, boys. Get away from that horse. What? You heard me. You'll make him nervous. I raised him from the time he was foaled. And I should make him nervous? Get the old buzzard out of here. I told you to keep away from that horse. You and who else? Why don't you go home and go to bed? Hey, I'll sprinkle flit on you. - Alright. That's enough. What's the matter, grandpa? Are you alright? What happened? I guess he fell down. Yeah. I fell down alright. Moonray. I'm going to bet ten dollars agin you. I'll see you again, young fellah. Hey Duke! Come here. Hello, grandpa. What's the matter, pulled a tendon? No, I bumped into a rat and pulled up lame. Say, did you lay off that big bet you took on Moonray? No, no. All the other books are loaded. I've been following the track for sixty years. This is the first time I ever pulled for my own horse to lose. Thanks grandpa. If I'm lucky you'll get your stud. You mean my old stud Miracle Lad? - You bet. I'll see you after the race. - Yeah, alright. Hey Duke .. Duke. I can't lay off enough to talk about it. - Okay. Forget it. Your Dubonnet looks fit. I'll string along with him. You've only one horse to be afraid of and that's Moonray with Dixie Gordon. Dixie is plenty rough and he'll win any way he can. I found that out in Kentucky. - Here we go, Hurley. Keep your horse clear until you come to the stretch. Then pop her a few times. She'll bring you home. Thank you Mrs Kiffmeyer for giving me my chance to come back. Hello Duke. - Hello, Fritzi. She looks ready. - I hope so. Hello, Fritzi. Ha. Will you say hello? Why sure. Why not? Hello. Well, I want to take over your losses. Who's lost? Well, you might lose and I want to protect you. Kiffy, I love you. Yes. But she doesn't. Hey, now wait a minute. Fritzi. You give him a kiss or I will. Muggins, will ..? - No. You are the most impossible man in the world. I know I am .. - But Dubonnet had better win. Oh, heavens. I've been holding the thought. Hello, Hartley. Aren't you excited, darling? - Yes, rather. How much have we got on this? - Enough to give you heart failure. Why don't you get back in your wheelchair Hurley, where you belong. Go, get that horse out of here, Gordon. - Ah, shut up. Rocket by a length. Moonray, second by a half. Dubonnet third. Ah, I can't stand to watch this. - Then close your eyes. How is it? Gordon is whipping Moonray. He's going to pass Rocket. Where is Dubonnet? - Third. Come on, Hurley. Gordon is giving Moonray a ride alright. Where is Dubonnet? - Third. - Oh, my. Dubonnet is moving up. He'll not touch Moonray. Not with Dixie Gordon riding. Dubonnet is second now. - That's still not good enough. Come on, Gordon. - Gordon? I mean Hurley. Achoo! Lay up, Gordon. - You can't get through, Hurley. Do you want it again? Come on! - Dubonnet! Achoo! Maybe he cut that way because he was on the outside. Boy, that was close. Who do you think won it, Tip? Don't ask me. - Alright. I won't. What is it, Hartley? A dead heat? I don't know. How about it, judge. Who won? I think it's Moonray, but we can't tell until we see the picture. Slow motion or still camera? Slow motion. It's more accurate. Judge, it looked like Moonray from where I sat. You were sitting down when you trained him. Will you leave before I blow you away? You know, I got a good mind to slug you. How long will it take to develop the pictures? - 17 minutes. You'd have saved yourself a lot of time judge if you'd kept your eyes open. Hey. Grandpa. What happened? I think he must have fainted. - Oh. Give me a bicarbonate of soda. - Yes, Ma'am. What's the matter, Fritzi? Nervous? - Yes. I know. A stomach full of butterflies, huh? Oh Duke, they feel like pigeons. When you start on that stuff it's time to quit. I'm not getting it for myself. It's for Carol. Carol? Where is she? Outside in my box. She knew you were here. She wouldn't come in. Why not? I think she's the most miserable girl in the world. Oh tell the girl to get wise to herself. I'd have done the same thing she did. Oh no you wouldn't and she knows it. That's what hurts. We women can do things to a guy we love that a man wouldn't do to a rattlesnake. Yeah, I know. That's what makes me feel so good. What are you going to do if Moonray wins? Well, I'll be in a pretty tight spot. I won't be able to buy grandpa that stud. Or fix up Brookvale or restock it with thoroughbreds. Yeah, that's right. Oh Duke, don't feel like that. Here, you take it to her. - Oh no, not me. Oh, Duke. - Will you turn off that tremolo. Oh you fool. Oh, here you are. Hello Dukey. Hello pal. Have a snort? - Oh, no thanks. I'll see you boys in the judge's room. - Alright. Do that again. - Yes, sir. I don't know what I'm going to do if that Dubonnet doesn't win. And you won't be able to fix up the farm for that lovely lady. Brandy, sir. - Yeah, thanks. Here. You need this worse than I do. - Yes, well perhaps I do. Why hello, Hartley. Looking for someone? - No. You'll find her in the Kiffmeyer box. Oh, thank you. I don't know. I don't like that man. Hey, it's about time. Let's see the pictures. Yes, well come on. What's going to happen if Dubonnet doesn't win? You can give me a job in one of your beauty parlors. Yes, I'll give you one of the beauty parlors. Hurry up, Kiffy. They're ready to start. Where shall I sit? - Right here. Come on. Thanks, darling. Well, are we ready? - All set, Mr Boswell. Close the shades. Oh Duke, I never wanted to win a race so much in my life. For all of us. Let?s have the picture. Now which one is that on the rail? That's Dubonnet. Achoo! Muggins, I can't stand th?s much longer. Can't they run a little faster? I'm dying. Well how do you think I feel? Hurley certainly is giving Dubonnet ? ride. This is the first time Gordon has been on the outside in a long time. Come on, Dubonnet. Dubonnet wins. - Oh Duke! Kiffy, darling! How about that stud you promised me? Go get him, grandpa. - Hot dog. Did I hear you say "Dubonnet"? That was Duke's cigar you smoked in Miami, wasn't it? Yes Hartley, it was. You can leave the track now, Duke. Fritzi. I love you. [ Singing: ] "And when somebody shouted: They're off!" "To his face came a horrible look of surprise." "The horse with the dreamy eyes."
