(fire blazing) (tribal drumming) (rhythmic ethnic music) (chanting) (whistling) (sinister exhalations) - Barc. Barc. Don't be a freedom fighter. (groaning) I need you. I can't let you go yet. Do you think I want to be here? - You don't exist. - You'd be surprised. What I want I'll get, just like you. I want your services for the help we've given you. - You weren't here when I needed you, and you're not here now! - Listen good. I won't repeat this. For my release, I need fire! I want you to start it! (speaking foreign language) (whimpering) - Come on, please. Look at me, look, look. Look at me, look at me. Babela, look, come on. Come on, Babela. (crying) Look at me, Babela, what you're doing makes no sense. - I can't, I can't even help myself. (sobbing) - [Fyah] Brethrens! Friends! Are you all pussies and cowards? I want to get out, I want to get out! You look at me, you think I'm crazy. I'm crazy? Huh? I'm crazy? I've seen you. Yes, you. You speak the language, the shadow language. Somebody bring him to me. - Shut it up, fool! - Do not speak to him in that manner! You, you! You should listen to my man. There are ways out of here. (speaking foreign language) - He's right. You know. He's right. (discordant foreboding music) - They need you. He's up here. - Say what, boy? - He's up here! (ominous music) - [Fyah] Show me him. - (shushes) It's all right, it's all right. - [Fyah] You! (ominous drumming) (Barc shouting) - I want to check something. Don't fight me. - You're a witch! (screams) - Quiet, quiet, quiet. You must agree with me that we've got to get out of here right away. (shushes) Come bleed with us. Come bleed with us. - We ain't going nowhere soon. We ain't leaving until all these places are filled! - I want to get out, and I want to get out now. I have a blood lust, a blood lust for MacKee. - Surely you want revenge for the one who put us here. - If we beat them, what good would that do? Violence won't get you nowhere. (tense music) - You wanna die? I hate to do this, I don't want to break your neck, but I will break it. I will snap it in two, now you-- - Now you will give us a spell. (gasping) - I don't have nothing! Even if I wanted to help you, I don't have no ingredients. I don't have nothing for a spell! - You are worth nothing to me dead. They are worth nothing to me at all. Tell them to stop eating. If they die, they have no price. - What did she say to you? What did she say to you? - [Barc] Don't eat! - We must refuse sustenance, the witch has spoken. Don't eat, don't eat. Don't eat! - Don't, don't eat. - Don't eat. - Don't eat! - Don't eat, don't eat! - Don't eat! - Don't eat! - Don't eat! - Don't eat! - Don't eat! - Don't eat, don't eat! - Don't eat! - Don't eat! - Don't eat! - [Group] Don't eat, don't eat! Don't eat, don't eat, don't eat! - Louder, come on! - Don't eat, don't eat! Don't eat! (chanting) - [Wood] Don't eat! Don't eat! Starve! Starve! Starve! (chanting) (wailing) (suspenseful drumming) - Don't eat, don't eat! Don't eat, come on! Don't eat! Come on, don't eat! Don't eat! Why did you stop, huh? Why did you stop? (seagulls squawking) (gentle guitar music) (sinister exhalations) - There's one dangling! One of them blackfish is dangling. - [Skinner] Is he dead? - Oh, man, he's just dangling. - [Skinner] Then untangle him. Hey, watch yourself, don't be getting too close to that nigger, or he'll bite your ass. Or you just may get some of that coon fever. Don't show any fear, what's wrong with you? They'll smell that shit, and they'll turn on you. - Well, why don't you give me a hand, cocksucker? - [Skinner] I'm up here, securing the hatch. You're down there, you figure it out. And do it now. - Come on! (screaming) - [Skinner] There you go. Now that wasn't so hard, was it? Just go on over to the food bowls, feed 'em like I showed you. That's it. - [Bodgie] I'm on it, Skinner. - [Skinner] I know you are. Just slop it out there for 'em. - [Group] Don't eat, don't eat! - [Skinner] Don't feed 'em too much, now, 'cause we don't want 'em getting fat now, do we? Don't be taking all day, boy. I got things to do. - I'm doing it, Skinner, I got it, everything's cool. (rhythmic drumming) Everything's cool. (rhythmic drumming) Come on! (whistling) - [Skinner] Yeah, that's it, all them darkies dig it. That's it, you did a great job. That is exactly the way I told you to do it. I think you've got natural talent there, boy. - [Bodgie] Oh. Come on, Skinner, don't be a cunt! (Skinner laughing) Come on, man. - Hey, now, you have not finished your job, what was that exactly? - Holy puss nuts, to feed 'em. - [Skinner] That's right, and to make sure that they eat it. And I'm not letting you back up until all those bowls are empty, do you hear me? - Lookie. Mm. Mm, yum, yum. (rhythmic drumming) (group chanting) - Skinner? Skinner! - What? - [Bodgie] I could use a hand up here! Skinner! (foreboding piano music) - What's up, niggers? See, that'll never work. You've got to show 'em who's dominant. They like it, don't you, huh? How about you, huh? (shouts) That's it. Oh, there's my big buck. So, big fellow, you broke Jeremiah's arm, huh? Well, I'm the boss now. (Fyah spits) I'm the boss. (shouts) (grunting) If they don't want to eat, then you've just got to feed them. (screaming) Come on, boys. - Don't eat! (coughing) - [Skinner] Eat your dinner, eat your dinner. (grunting) (tense drum music) (rhythmic chanting) - Back, motherfucker! (gun fires) - Down, down! What's going on? What's going on, down, down! (shouts in pain) (gun fires) - Fucking nigger bastard. (screaming) (shouts) Get your nappy-head ass out of the water! (Ekundayo screaming) - Okay, he's ready to go, haul him up! (dog barking) - [Cowlie] Is that him? - Damn! Oh, where the fuck did he go? - He's out of range. Let him drown. - Bodgie's down! They gored Valter, too. (dog barking) Skinner looks like he's got some left in him. - Two belly up. What have you done? No. I want a full cargo inspection. - Come on, come on, move! - Now we're six, needle dick. Six. How's this going to work with six? - Don't even fucking start with me. (dog barking) (rhythmic drumming) - [Pop] 24 of us, and only six of them, but we lowered our odds. We were sitting off the home coast, close like a tease. I wasn't gonna skip from this shit. The white devils paid that traitor, MacKee, who said that he would deliver 60 more, and made sure that they believed this by giving him three hostages, two of his own wives, and his virgin bride-to-be. Can you believe? The white crooks had fallen for the oldest trick in the book. Haven't the devils heard that that bastard MacKee never keeps his word? (groaning) (man screaming) (screaming) - [Man] Quiet and locked, put them away. (clamoring) (gun fires) - What the hell? - Get down there! Come here! Come here, come here, come here. Come on, hurry up. - You the captain? What's up? See, we got your nigger, Captain. - Well, bring him up, tossers, what are you waiting for? - [Sailor] What you gonna give me, white boy? - [Cowlie] I'll sweeten your pot, don't worry about that. - Wait until MacKee finds out, just wait. Come here. (whimpering) - Stand up! Come here, get up, back! On down, hey, hey, hey. Get back. Get down there, move it! Come here, come on, hurry up! Hurry up! (ominous drumming) - He's the troublemaker. - He's a moneymaker! - [Jeremiah] Move it, move it! Come here, come on. - Your ass is mine now. (foreboding music) Pack and lock! - You can always tell a cherry. - Oh, I'll be so sorry to see her leave. That's if we ever see MacKee again. He sticks to his word. That bastard's the only reliable one we have left. (lock clicks) - You know, you must really trust the man, when you take a child and two bitches in lieu of 60 of them, huh? - I can't wait to tell the Mack about this one. Those guys are total amateurs! He's going to leave us with these people? - You really think you'll see him again? - He's got to come. - [Femi] He doesn't have to do anything. - First off, he owes those creeps a whole bunch of slaves. Second, he's got to come for his prized possession. - [Femi] I wouldn't put it past him not to show. - He may not. - Fa, don't worry yourself. We have to get out of here. - Why? - He's not gonna come. - Just wait, he's going to come and take us home. You think he's going to come and leave us here? (gentle choral music) - Tell me why. Tell me why. (crying) - Because. Because he, because he's already had me! - The Mack has already had you? You wait until now to tell us this? Do you know how many times The Mack has had me? The Mack has had me, the Mack has had me, you think me, too, I like it? But we don't say anything. (sinister exhalations) (foreboding music) - [Pop] Like hate, it's the smell of oozing folks. We all sweat and spill our yolks. Human juices, sacks of fluids on the wood, like a tease. I'm allowed to breathe in the upstairs air, but no one cares. It is cruel to me. She thought I wanted to shut her out. - Packed and locked! - [Pop] I can't help but get a spark of hope. I have no room for you and me. - Die, die, die! (ominous piano music) - It's all right, little one. I'm not gonna hurt you. Just want to make you feel good. So sweet. So young. - [Vet] Skinner? (gentle piano music) Skinner! Skinner! - We've gotta get out of this hell. (seagulls squawking) (slow ambient music) - [Jeremiah] What the hell are you doing down there? Hurry up! Don't make me come down there! (foreboding music) - What I felt in my mouth was like a cold, coiled snake. It could have killed me. It wasn't too late to swallow the gift that lifted me to fate. It's not too late. (whispering) (mournful singing) Babela! Babela! Look. Babela, look. Look. Look! - Let me see that. You got that from the girl, didn't you? Didn't you? Kid's got a ribbon. A hair ribbon from the girl. - I don't want to get killed because of your bullshit! - If he can bring this, think what else he can bring down to-- - Now I mean it, silence! - [Nassor] There is no way out! - Get a grip, Nassor, we have no angle. - No more shadows! No more of that stuff. Don't you want to see the light? Don't you want to breathe the sun? - No! Now shut the fuck up! (seagulls squawking) (bell clanging) - [Jeremiah] Blimey! Cock sucking limey nigger, look! - [Captains] Limey bastards aren't gonna stop us now. Get under sail, hustle, hustle, boys, come on, let's go! - [Fey] What's going on? (foreboding music) - They're taking us away. - That can't be. - Now there's no place to slip off to. - I should have, I mean. We should have just gone for it. We should have got off. Now they've got us. Now they've got us. (gun fires) We're dead. - [Cowlie] There. There, that's the river mouth, head up there. (wood creaking) - Home? - Yeah. ♪ Yeah ♪ - [Vet] If a goddamn British warship just waits for us, they'll catch us on the way out! (birds calling) - Home. (foreboding music) (singing in foreign language) (birds calling) - It looks like every one of those bozales is going to count. Keep 'em well preserved. Especially the females, And I need that virgin hole intact. She's really all I've got right now. - If we slip past those English ticks, we can sell what we have and do more than break even. - These ain't no ill-gotten gains we're talking about. They're bought and paid for, every one of them, and the Mack owes us 60 more. I'm just paying a visit to that afterbirth. And remember what I said, intact. Draw up some more canvas walls, we don't want to lose any more cargo. (chickens clucking) Bon Cleaver? (ominous piano music) - Yo! (ominous piano music) We'll blow those limeys, jolly boat, and a whole shit parade straight to the crocodiles. - Those chinless wonders don't bother me. But I want to be damn sure I have a ride when I get back. - You're starting to sound more like me, my man. - God forbid. - Who'd have the nerve to turn on you, huh? - [Vet] Oh! - It's just that he's got such itty bitty balls. - I'll bite 'em off. And I'll shove 'em up his sphincter. - [Cowlie] Don't look at me like that, I ain't dead. I'll be back to spit on your graves yet. - One belly up, and one! (grunting) Three, four! Five! (dog barking) - [Vet] Okay, guys! - [Pop] They whispered that the witch laid the shadow of death on the stiff. Could it be? - One belly up! - All right, come on, niggers. - Go, go! - Can't help your black ass. - Hey! - Come on! - Oh, shit! - Keep moving. - Here they come, take care of it! - Move it! (chattering) Move it, move it! Move it, you black assholes! Move it, move it, hey, hey, hey. (clamoring) - Skinner! I can't find nothing wrong with him. - Yeah, well, you just better check. You don't know what kind of diseases these goddamn coons got. And that kind of shit spreads like wildfire. Come on, big dog, come here. (dog barking) (chickens clucking) Let's do it. (whimsical music) Up, up, hose them niggers down. (upbeat music) (clamoring) - You, you killed our leader. - [Fenuku] You cast a shadow, you witch motherfucker! - No, Babela ain't never hurt no one! - Stop! The kid is right, we don't know if he's the one. (clamoring) (upbeat music) (moaning) - [Fat Man] I'll off you. - Big man, big man! Go, huh, go. - Hey, Obeah! Don't turn on each other. The Obeah can get us out. - [Barc] I don't wanna lead. - You, you gave the boy a gift. - Yes, I did, we can beat those devils together. - The only way we can match them is with firepower. - Firepower, guns? - Can you lay your hands upon a gun? - I haven't had a chance, but I know where they hide one. - [Nassor] This is the only way. The boy can smuggle it to us. - Too fucking good, that's too fucking good. Get that nigger. (upbeat music) - And you'll get us, too? - I swear on my life! If you do this, every soul will be free! - What? - Over there! (clamoring) - Nigger, nigger, you back there? Fucking plotting nigger motherfucker! - Don't hurt the play along the way. - Backstabbing traitor, I will blow your ass away! - Water, here, here! - I'm coming for you now, you hear me? - Come on, Skinner, come on. Just come on down, we gotta get them back in. Come on, come on. (clamoring) Come on, Skinner! - Baby girl. Baby, what you doing, huh? (shouting) - Get in there! Get in! (dogs barking) - You know that sweet nigger pussy of yours wants my big white dick inside of you. Yeah, baby. - Hey! - You know you want it. - They need you back in there, man. Come on, let me lock the bitches up. - Let me tell you something. When those darkies decide to turn on you, they're gonna come after you, they're gonna skin your lily white ass, and there ain't shit you're gonna be able to do about it. Do you understand me? And I'll be back for you, darling. - Well, we'll worry about that when the time comes, right? - [Jeremiah] Got 'em packed, locked, and stowed down here! - Right? Skinner? Skinner? Right? Who are you? No, no. Who are you? Who? Who am I? Get down there! You want to fuck him? You, you want to fuck him? Hey, you want to fuck me? You want to fuck me? I want to fuck him! Get down there, get down there. He doesn't want to fuck you, and you. Fucking cunt. Fucking wog, fucking nog! I'll fuck you, I'll fuck you! Fuck you! (thunder rumbling) (foreboding music) (sinister exhalations) - Once we get that piece, we'll be in control. - How can we get a gun? - She can do it, she seemed sure. - Then you have lost your mind. - What, you don't want to play anymore? The mighty, the invincible. We have a real chance. - If we do, if we really do get a gun, then we have a small chance. Right now we have nothing, nothing but your pipe dreams. - Look. Don't hurt the play, please. Under no circumstances. We can't mess this up. (thunder rumbling) - I won't. - [Pop] Clear for them, leave it to me. I have no need. (somber music) I have no fear. I'm cold down here. (rain pattering) - Cowlie. Sure has got him some big old hairy, dangling, hard steel balls, I'll tell you. I wouldn't go back in there. (thunder rumbling) - You've been in there? - Never will again, boy. Hell found a hole in there, and jizzed right out. - Skinner and his buddy had themselves a little picnic with the jigaboos. - [Cabin Boy] I don't understand. What happened? - Look out there, boy. What you don't see is that that whole place is swarming with them niggers. And if you look real closely, you can see the veins, andthe white parts of their eyes. I was with 'em for four days. Ted only lasted three. Started with his legs, while he was alive. Then they took him and roasted him from the bottom up. Nice and crispy. - Boy! (thunder cracks) You and me start soon! Same for your captain, man. - No more handouts! - My master MacKee has a message for you. - Talk to me! I'm the one in charge! - Get out of here! Get out of here right now, or you'll eat the mushroom that make the fearless vomit! If I'll rip out your heart, you rassclat! If I send you back to hell, you cockasoy! If I send you back to hell where you belong, then I'll piss on your grave, you know. If you don't leave this land by sunrise, then I'll kill you! I'll feed you to the pigs! The fucking devil, you know! You're fucking gagging on prophesy, you know! If you don't leave now, you'll die! You'll die of the same slime that sleeps with your mama's puss. So get out! - [Jeremiah] Well, holy shit, I don't need this. - Now we're fighting a two front war? - [Jeremiah] I really don't need this. (chuckling) - Just 'cause that kook said what he did? He's just trying to fuck with us. - Oh, and the British patrol out there, they're just trying to spook us? - What are we talking about here? - [Cabin Boy] We could bail. - No, no. I ain't saying that. - I should fuck you up right now just for saying that. - Yeah! (rain pattering) (sinister exhalations) (spitting) (speaking in foreign language) - [Barc] Bring the power down. Bring the power down. (Barc spits) - [Vet] Hey. - All right, just the man I want to see. The Turk MacKee has turned on us, so it's a whole new deal, and I want to get me some pussy. So. - You, you can't wait? - Oh, yeah, well, it's easy for you to say, you've been butt slamming the whole trip. I want to get me some real pussy. Why don't you open this up? - I'm gonna open this door, but I'm only gonna open this door if I get first taps. - So you flip and you flop, huh? - Yeah. - All right, let's do it, come on, come on. Come on, come on, let's go. (muttering) (spitting) (sniffs) (chuckles) - Udders. Udders, udders, udders. Now, if I poke her, it's gonna be blood? Blood's gonna crust me all up? What, what did? - I don't know, man. Never had a virgin. - Oh. Well. At least she'll be disease-free, yeah? She'll be clean, not like these, not like, not like her. Old, used. Yeah. (chuckling) Distended, it looks distended. (laughing) - You're out there. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, she's the only one who has enough room to take you. - [Skinner] That's true. - Yeah, you should go, you should go there. Who do you think I should choose? Huh? - Don't do this, man. No, man, no, listen. You know that I ain't never had no cherry. I was waiting for this one. (ominous piano music) All right, bust the cherry. Take the hag with you. I'll just have me some of this black woman here. (speaking in foreign language) (groaning) (screeching) - Go. Get me moon cycle blood. (Fey shouting) (Skinner grunting) (speaking foreign language) (Fey crying) (Fey screaming) - Show her yours. - Not now. - Come on, please? - No way. - Come on. Come on, show her yours, please. (Fey screaming) (smacking) (slow accordion music) Are we gonna have a show? (Fey wailing) Do you need the ship? I need the keys. (Fey wailing) (Skinner shouting) (foreboding music) (Fey crying) - [Skinner] Fuck you, fuck you! Fuck you, make me cum! Come on, come on, come on, come on! (Skinner grunting) (slow accordion music) - I'm bored. But you have a shirt on your back, and belly full, what more do you want? I want more. More of what? More, more! More of everything, everything, everything! Everything, ow, ow! Everything, everything! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Everything! Why are you hitting me? 'Cause you're here. Because I'm wicker. I'm tired of being beat. Let's go somewhere were we can beat someone smaller than me, someone weaker than me. All right. Let's go to Africa and get some of those natives that are weak Then we can pick on them. And sell 'em! And you can have everything you want. I like that. - Fuck's name is this shit? - Hello, man, it's a show. How was your date? - Kiss my ass. I couldn't get it off with the bitch. ♪ He's too drunk to fuck ♪ - I just wasn't waste my seed in that. - Just a heartbeat ago, you couldn't wait to get your dick in one of them, and now you're on about that again. - Hey, limp dick, I have fucked chickens, sheep, and goats. I even had me a Clydesdale once. I'm here to tell you that the nigger bitch could not get me off. - Now you're talking a bunch of shit. If they're animals like you say, how come they can put on a show? - Because, you dumb shit, they is the trained ones. You can't pull that kind of crap with the untrained ones. Do you understand? Do you understand? (Fa crying) (creaking) - This, this is stupid. Let's stop it, right here. Right, right, right now! (slow accordion music) - What's a matter, big boy? Can't get it up? It's all right. That's the right. (grunting) - [Cooper] Looks like a fine place. Any place is fine with me. Let's check it out. Come on, let's look around. Look at them. Weak little natives here. See, I told you. - [The Wood] Don't hurt the play along the way. - [Cooper] What do we do with him now? (speaking foreign language) (upbeat accordion music) (grunting) (shouting) (growling) (laughing) - Don't pay attention when I talk to you, nigger! (Fyah cries out) You know what the problem is? Problem is that you're not paying any attention. Nobody's paying attention. (flies buzzing) (grunting) - [Jeremiah] You've really broken this one. - If he's broke, then they's all broke. Except for you, my little one. Fags, they can't break you. - [Vet] All right, Skinner, you've had your fun. - I ain't had jack yet. - You take that dolly right out of there. Come on. Come on. You've had your fun. (chuckles) Now it's time for the old P and L. (solemn choral music) - She's a beauty. - [Fa] I'll hold onto it until we see the boy. - You're not still serious about that? Now we have this, and you still want to blow our chances on them? I mean, we can free them, but first, we've got to get the upper hand here. This is not why I sacrificed myself. - We've all made sacrifices. But it's gotta start from the bottom. If we really wanna change this hell, then it's gotta come from below. (sinister exhalations) (ominous creaking) (moaning) - Shadows, take me as your host. I will gladly spread sophisticated sickness. (ominous music) I lay this curse upon you, for your fears of all things foreign. (groans) Spare only those that rattle authority. (spits) (rumbling) - [Pop] Through the cracks in my eyes, with sleep as my disguise, I watched him curse you. (ship creaking) - [Jeremiah] Going down. - [Cooper] Jeremiah! Get me some water, man, I'm thirsty. - [Jeremiah] Get your own shit, you fat asshole. - [Cooper] Come on, you fuck. (coughing) (Jeremiah vomits) - Holy virgin God. (retching) Goddammit. Come here, you little shit! Hey, hey! (coughing) (chickens clucking) (foreboding music) (coughing) - Jeremiah, where's the hair of that dog? (Jeremiah coughing) - My piss, motherfucker, I'm already feeding them. - Get some water, you fuck. (coughing) - Watch your back with those devils. - Now, listen, listen, boy! Don't blow it. - You won't. (tense music) - Good luck. - Hey! (chickens clucking) What are you waiting for, you cunt licking little rat?

(muttering) Shit, fiddle fart, candy ass motherfucker! (coughing) (flies buzzing) Damn motherfucker. (chickens clucking) - Jeremiah? Thirsty, man. Jeremiah? (gun cocks) (suspenseful music) - Boy. What you're doing is sheer suicide. You can't just stay here. - I'm staying with Babela. - [The Wood] Leave us. (slow drumming) - Look, I helped you. I just don't trust your kind. Ain't nowhere to run. - I'd do anything to change your mind. - [Pop] Ain't nowhere to run to. If the devils don't get you, you'll get snatched up by MacKee's men again. - Get your ass-- - Fucker! - [Man] Get your ass up there! (chickens clucking) (screams) (gun fires) - No, no!

There's still some down there! Ladder, now, now! Rot in your kennels! This, this hatch stays shut till Cowlie's back. (birds calling) - And rot we did. Those that didn't or couldn't run dropped like flies, one by one, till I lived in a grave. (slow guitar music) Babela? Babela. They're taking us away. Tell me that your magics worked. Tell me that your magics worked. - [Barc] Magic always works. (tense guitar music) (bell ringing) - It's that slaver we spotted last week. Prepare to come about! I can't make out what's going on. (slave screams) Prepare a boarding party. - [Cowlie] Let's see some kind of a warrant before you mess her up! - [Captain Strungblow] All right, lads, fan out and-- - This is an outrage. - [Sailor] You and you, come on, in the hole, let's go! Get a ladder. (chattering) Come on, let's move. (growling) - Pin him down! - [Sailor] Come on, get a ladder, let's go. (growling) - Hey, keep him still. - Wog? - You're not going to find anything. - There's naught down here! - He said she's empty. - Wog? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
