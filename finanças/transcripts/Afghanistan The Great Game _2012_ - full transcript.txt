Afghanistan - one of the most isolated, barren landscapes on Earth. It's difficult to believe that any empire would want to invade it, and yet it's become the unlikely target and obsession of some of the world's greatest empires and superpowers. In 1839, up these city walls above Kabul, marched red-coated veterans of Waterloo. In 1879, Highlanders charged to the sound of the bagpipes. In 1979, Russian special forces swooped over these hills in their helicopters. And in 2001, an American-led coalition invaded Afghanistan. Each of these invasions has ended in tragedy and humiliation, and each has sparked a fierce Afghan resistance. We have never, ever liked to be conquered. It's really easy to get into Afghanistan. It's just the getting-out part that is very difficult. Don't go into Afghanistan and get, whatever you do, involved in a tribal war. HE CHANTS Starting with the British invasions of the 19th century, how has this history forged the Afghanistan of today? And what is it about this place and the paranoia and aggression of empires that has created repeated tragedy? In these two films, I want to explore what dragged these great nations into Afghanistan, and why they found it so difficult to leave. To sense some of the complexity of the Afghanistan that Victorian Britain chose to invade, you don't even need to leave contemporary London. I've come to Ealing for an evening of Afghan food, music and traditional costume with a group of Afghans now resident here in west London. HE GREETS THEM 'In this room, a dizzying array of ethnic groups - 'Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, 'Turkmen, Nuristani, all Afghans, 'and all holding different religious and political views.' The divisions and consequences of war have led to more than five million Afghans fleeing their country since the 1980s. Do you think, for example, Britain should remain in Helmand? Until they will have the infrastructure in the proper way, I think they should remain. You don't think the British should remain in Helmand? Absolutely not. The microcosm of Afghanistan is there in that room, and some of these people are now sitting down together round a table, and in those histories and the suspicions of who joined the jihad, who came from which ethnic group, are many of the fissures that continue to haunt Afghanistan today. And all this complexity and Afghan history, both ancient and modern, so difficult to understand, so often overlooked, still matters deeply for all of us today. And it continues to preoccupy commentators, such as Akbar Ahmed, who I've come to meet here in Washington DC. Professor Ahmed, a Pakistani who once worked as an administrator on the North-West Frontier with Afghanistan, arrived in the States where he now teaches, a day before the World Trade Center attack. But his direct appeal to the White House for caution fell on deaf ears. I think on 9/11 the US administration had no idea about Afghanistan, its tribes, its history, but it was so motivated, so intensely motivated by a sense of anger, a sense of revenge, a sense of honour, that, at all costs, it had to rush into Afghanistan. I said many, many superpowers have gone charging into Afghanistan. Be very careful. And that is the big problem, that when you combine arrogance with a lack of knowledge of that part of the world, you are almost guaranteed to run into trouble. I sensed this tension myself when I walked across Afghanistan shortly after 9/11. I found a hospitable and attractive country, but still deeply conservative, isolated and difficult for a foreigner to understand. It made me reflect on the superpowers who have so often invaded the mountains of Afghanistan, how often they get caught up in their own strategic games, how easily they become out of touch, failing to grasp the complexity and resistance of Afghanistan. And I felt the same was true for the British in the 19th century. When they came, they were focused not on Afghanistan itself, but its neighbours. If I were a British Redcoat standing on this wall in 1839, I would have been told that the reason I was here was that British India lay to the east and Russia lay to the north, and Afghanistan was trapped between two expanding empires. Afghanistan, a largely barren country, but with a rich Islamic civilisation, had long fought and traded with its Muslim and Asian neighbours, but it had never encountered a non-Muslim power as alien as Britain. And yet, in the 1830s, Afghanistan was perceived, as it is believed to be today, to be an immediate threat to British national security, a place for the politicians and generals of empire to fret about. For hundreds of years, all the conflicts had happened here in Europe and suddenly it exploded east. Russia raced towards Japan, Britain came into India, and as these great empires expanded, there was this zone in between, almost a blank space on the map with very, very few towns, a place of deserts and mountains. And although these two empires were still 4,000 miles apart, they were certain that they were about to meet. They were going meet here, in Afghanistan. As Britain and Russia stretched and flexed, Afghanistan, one of the most remote and impoverished kingdoms in the world, found itself sandwiched between two empires who both claimed, at least, to be its friend. Britain feared Russia might creep south towards British-ruled India, the jewel in the crown of the Empire, and the second centre of British political power. But suspicions worked both ways. The Russians were equally nervous about Britain moving north from its base in India. Sensing that these two empires would collide in Afghanistan, the British government was hungry for intelligence on this blank space. A spy was despatched. Alexander Burnes, a man I believe to be one of our greatest ever political officers. This is not a man actually in fancy dress. He's in disguise. One of dozens of British officers who made their reputations doing journeys which were almost suicidal. Burnes was one of the very first to study Afghanistan for British intelligence. His spying mission was both extraordinary and brave. In 1831, travelling undercover in disguise, he surveyed the route all the way from India through Kabul to Bukhara, and produced the first detailed accounts of Afghan politics. He set off with no protection into one of the most dangerous and unknown parts of Asia, a place where his predecessors had been killed, where he was having to run the gauntlet of slave traders, where he was a Christian moving through some regions which were fanatically Muslim and which were famous for killing infidels. Trying to rely all the way not on his sword but, as he says in a letter to his mother - on his languages, on his charm, on his politeness. Along with the suicidal danger of what Burnes did was the incredible reward because, when he returned back to London having completed this journey, this nearly 12-month journey through largely unknown country, he was a massive celebrity. He returned 28 years old, had an audience with the king, was made a member of the Athenian Club, got a gold medal from the Royal Geographical Society. And the book Burnes wrote, Travels To Bukhara, became an overnight bestseller. But, although it gave Britain a unique insight into this largely unknown land, according to historian William Dalrymple, his visit also terrified the Russians and had an unanticipated, counterproductive effect. There are British agents in Central Asia long before the Russians had taken any interest in cities like Bukhara and Khiva. And it's only when Burnes' travel book Journeys Into Bukhara is translated into French and becomes widely read in Moscow, that the Russians think they should send an agent in to make sure the British are not manoeuvring and making plots in their backyard. Shortly after Burnes was sent back to Kabul in 1836, he spotted this Russian agent, Jan Vitkevich, and the Russian's arrival terrified the British. They became, in turn, very suspicious of Russia's ambitions in the country. And this mutual paranoia led to more and more foreign intelligence operations around Afghanistan, with rival officers like Vitkevich and Burnes sending back countless reports on each other's activities. The Russians called it The Tournament of Shadows. The British now remember it, thanks to Rudyard Kipling's later writing, as The Great Game. One of my favourite books is Kipling's Kim, which describes The Great Game through the eyes of this young English boy, who's working on the North-West Frontier as a spy. It's incredibly dangerous work, his intrigues with the Russians. He's a secret agent, he's deniable, he's at arm's length from the British government. But, of course, this was a game that had two teams and on the other side, the Russians, men like Vitkevich, travelling into Kabul, developing relationships with the Afghan king, returning with his own documents and maps, the beginning of a whole tradition, whereby whenever the British saw a Russian painter turn up in the city, a Russian hunter turn up on the frontier, they would immediately assume that this was a double game of espionage. It was all these fears and suspicions of empire that were to turn Afghanistan into a battleground, according to Britain's former ambassador to Moscow, historian Sir Rodric Braithwaite. They thought that the Russians are getting their agents into Kabul and we must forestall them. We've got to do something here, with these Russians allegedly coming over the frontiers. The Russians had a mirror image view of us. They saw our agents penetrating northern Afghanistan into areas of central Asia, which they thought were their interest. They believed that these guys would come with propaganda, Islamic propaganda, weapons, money, and stir up these places against the Russians, so they were as terrified as we were. By 1839, the British government was increasingly obsessed with the Russian threat. Key advisers, men who'd never set foot in Afghanistan, began to claim that Russia might use Afghanistan as a stepping stone for the invasion of British India. Britain's man on the ground in Afghanistan, Alexander Burnes, thought that Afghanistan should be left well alone, but a small group of policy-makers in the government of India had very different ideas. They ignored Burnes completely. In their minds, Afghanistan was an empty failed state into which Russia would move. The hawks decided the answer was regime change, to topple the sitting king of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammad, and replace him with their own man. British intelligence felt they had the perfect candidate, Shah Shuja, a man who'd been living in British India for 30 years, urbane and beautifully dressed, a man who could be relied upon to do Britain's bidding. To justify themselves, they published a document claiming that Dost Mohammad, who was trying to keep his distance from both Russia and Britain, was in fact disloyal to the British and represented an imminent and urgent threat to the British Empire. The motives are always very mixed. It's both the aggressive, expansive imperial instinct, plus the terror that it's going come up against a brick wall or somebody's going to come and take it all away from you. And the trouble with intervention is that you may or may not have identified the right target but you then tend to use the wrong means for dealing with it. So were the hawks right to fear Russia? Here in Moscow, I've come to meet an eminent Russian historian of the period, Professor Tatiana Zagarodnikova. I wanted to ask her if Russia was really preparing to invade Afghanistan as a bridgehead for an attack on India. That was a time of colonisation of smaller, weaker states and that was a process all over the world, not only in Great Britain and in Russia. The same in France, the same in other great powers. Great Britain at that time considered every step of Russia, either in Europe or in Asia, and maybe even in Africa, as a Russian step towards India. Everything was considered as the Russians' march to India. Were the British paranoid? Well, it was just, to my mind, it was a game, kind of making face, towards audience, towards public opinion. Another thing is that that was a wonderful pretext in the parliament to demand more money for military purposes, for keeping big armies in India, and so on. The hawks were obsessed with putting their man on the throne, but their belief in a Russian threat was more faith than reality. The dossier was torn to pieces in the British press. Everyone from the Duke of Wellington attacked the idea as madness, but rather than calling off the mission, these men pushed on and, within a few weeks, the Army of the Indus was marching into Afghanistan. As we know in our own time, if you create a phantasm, a horror figure of your own imaginings, that figure can actually come into being. You can imagine a threat into life. Just like the neo-cons had wanted to topple Saddam Hussein long before 9/11, and 9/11 gave the neo-cons the excuse they were looking for. In the same way the hawks, the Russophobes, in the British establishment in Simla and in Calcutta, had been wanting to pre-empt the Russians in central Asia. MILITARY DRUM AND PIPE MUSIC PLAYS As they wound their way through the narrow passes towards Kabul, the British Army were supremely confident. They'd never been defeated in central Asia, and many in the army were treating it as a game. A lot of the young officers were behaving as though they were going on a grand picnic. Their generals were enraged. These 22-year-olds were travelling with camel trains, piled with mess silver, with eau de cologne, with exotic wines. The 16th Lancers even managed to bring their own pack of foxhounds towards Afghanistan. The Army of the Indus arrived in Kabul in April 1839, and as they swaggered into the city, they had little idea of the horrors ahead. The British entered Kabul in squadrons, the Royal Horse Artillery in gold, the Lancers in scarlet, the Dragoons in blue, the ostrich feathers on the hats of the envoys, with all the glory of a parade, a victory parade. But around them in the crowded bazaar - blank faces, hostility, suspicion. Britain had taken a decisive step and placed an army of occupation in this distant and unlikely land. But as the soldiers settled into life in Kabul, their need for security made them live in protected compounds, separate from the Afghan people, and this only encouraged suspicions on both sides. The English knew so little about the real life of Kabul. If they came down to the city at all, they travelled in armed groups, seeing hostile Afghan faces, glimpses of tiny windows, blank mud walls and they had very, very little idea about the rich civilisation behind those doors. Largely hidden from and totally misunderstood by most British troops, was a culture of extraordinary richness, a culture of calligraphy, miniature painting and poetry, with sophisticated Afghan forms of law, government and patronage. The occupation dragged on and the British only became more and more entrenched and the Afghans began to get anxious. The thing that really worried the Afghans was when the women began to arrive and European babies were born, that the British were here to stay. The British, in the towers of their fort, and the Afghans gazing back at them from their family compounds, began to look at each other with deepening mistrust and incomprehension. I've come to a rain-soaked Boston to meet a world authority on Afghan anthropology and history, Professor Tom Barfield. Appropriately, I met him here in the Helmand Restaurant. And I wanted ask him about some of the many differences between these cultures. If you go to an Afghan feast, people are very religious, but they're religious at the end of the meal. You thank God for having eaten a wonderful meal. As one of my Afghan friends said to me, "Why do you Americans pray before the meal? "You haven't eaten it. You have no idea whether God deserves "the praise or not, or the host." But the lesson that I took from him is that we foreigners are too keen to praise the fact that the feast is here and the Afghans say, "There's one more step. "Let's eat the feast and decide whether it deserves it." So the Afghans tend to look more at the outcome, than at the intentions. 'And that logic appears to apply 'to how Afghans choose the perfect leader.' The ideal ruler says to the Afghans that, "Without me, these foreigners would invade and occupy our country. "Without me and my skill, "Afghanistan would not be independent. "I am defending a Muslim nation." At the same time, he turns to the foreigners and says, "Only I can keep control of "the Afghans and I can only do that if you send me money and weapons." By 1841, Britain's choice of ruler had proved a disaster. Once Shah Shuja was on the throne, Afghans quickly saw him as weak, as corrupt and, worst of all, as a puppet of a foreign non-Muslim government. In a courtyard in Kabul, I asked Afghan academic Omar Sharifi about how Afghans perceived Shah Shuja. If you were an Afghan seeing a red-coated British soldier in the street, what would your reaction be? Nobody really knew what was happening in Afghanistan. Optimistic British officers felt that with a bit more time, and a bit more money, they were going to be able to win. And, suddenly, when rumours began to spread through the tea houses and the bazaars that British officers were interfering with Afghan women, a match had been lit, which would spark an insurgency. Suddenly, up and down the country, Afghans began to feel that their culture had been insulted, that their king was only a puppet, and that they needed to fight for Afghanistan and for Islam against a foreign military occupation. Dost Mohammad, the emir the British had deposed to make way for Shah Shuja, was in exile. But he and his family used the presence of non-Muslim occupiers to mobilise Afghans by calling for a jihad. And for many Afghans, this action was the birth of the modern state of Afghanistan, the moment around which they united as a nation. By November 1841, Muslims in Kabul were ready to join this jihad. But the British were taken completely by surprise. Even Alexander Burnes, our envoy so prized for his local knowledge, completely underestimated how dangerous the situation had become. Alexander Burnes loved Kabul and Afghan culture. He was used to walking through the streets as though he was at home in Scotland. If you'd asked him, he would have said he could have trusted Afghans with his life. But on that night in November 1841, he walked home to a city that had changed. He looked into eyes that no longer greeted him and, as he made his way back through the narrow streets towards his house, he was seeing a hostility that he hadn't sensed before. By dusk, an armed mob had surrounded his house. In one last attempt, he walked out onto the balcony of his house and in his most confident manner, in beautiful Persian, appealed to their sense of hospitality, of generosity, their treatment of a guest. But he got nothing back and, in the end, he had to send a desperate message to the British garrison asking for help, and, for the first time, retreated back into his house knowing that the only thing that stood between him and death were the gates of his house. Burnes' home, his paradise where he'd entertained for so long, the Kabul that he loved, had become a death trap. Burnes' last glimpse of a city that he loved and thought the most beautiful in the world was not of gardens, not of poetry, but a last desperate sprint across his neighbours' roofs hoping that he could find a way out, but the crowd was everywhere. He wrapped a turban around his head, dropped down, praying he wouldn't be recognised and for a moment he wasn't. But then the cry went up - "Sikander Burnes". He was hacked down. And the next morning his head was on a pole in the bazaar. The day before Burnes' death, the British had been congratulating themselves on the peace and tranquillity in Afghanistan. The day after, everything had collapsed. A British trooper came staggering into the fort with five musket wounds in his body, cuts to his head and shoulders, stark naked, having just escaped from the Afghan insurgents. The food was lost, the ammunition was running down, and within three days of Burnes' death, the British generals were talking about a treaty of surrender and a retreat from Kabul. The British Commander, General Elphinstone, tried to negotiate with the Afghans. The Afghans offered him safe passage, provided the British handed over their heavy weapons and retreated immediately to India. It must have felt like an impossible decision. If the garrison tried to stay, they could starve and be wiped out. But if they were to retreat, could they really trust the assurances of their enemy? I faced a similar dilemma on a smaller scale when I was a Deputy Governor in the south of Iraq after the invasion in 2004. Our compound was under siege. We were being attacked by Sadarist militia, and their commander came to us and said that if we agreed to leave our weapons and hand ourselves over to him, he would take us safely out of the fort and back. At the time I thought it was a trick, a trick to massacre us, and I felt, again, the same thing when I read this history. In Iraq, we stayed and defended the compound, but the British in Kabul, in 1841, were deeply divided. Many young officers were determined to fight on, but Elphinstone overruled them and ordered a retreat. All the troops, their wives and children, were forced to leave the relative safety of their compound, and to try and reach the British garrison in Jalalabad nine days' march east of Kabul. They made painfully slow progress and, after two days, this straggling column of soldiers and civilians met their fate beneath this mountain. This valley is the jaws of hell. Into this, in mid-winter, the cream of the British army marched and they were treated as though they were in a slaughterhouse. By the time they reached this valley, Khord Kabul, they had spent two nights out in the open, in three-foot snow in temperatures of minus 15 without tents, waking up to discover frozen corpses around them. They staggered into this valley, starving, frozen, with no supplies, and 80 miles to go, and it was at that point that the attack began. Behind every bolder was an Afghan with a musket taking careful aim, able to pick off, individually, 3,000 people and kill them as they made their way through the valley. And it continued, not just for one or two miles, but for five miles of a ravine. By the time they reached the end of that valley, 90% of the British army had been extinguished. A handful of soldiers managed to fight their way through, but only to meet their fate later. What we've got here is the last stand of the 44th Foot at Gandamak. 50 men make it to the village of Gandamak. They stand on this low hill and they have run out of ammunition, they're relying only on their bayonets. And the picture we see here is half of them are dead and the Pathans are about to close in and end it with their swords. Of the 17,000 men, women and children who'd set out nine days earlier from Kabul, only one made it to the British garrison in Jalalabad. One man has made it on from there, this Dr Brydon. And in this picture, Dr Brydon is sitting on his old nag, about to collapse and he is seen limping towards Jalalabad, and they assume he's only the first of thousands of troops to make it, and the gates are opened and a party sent out. And they realise he's the only one. And that night, the commanding officer orders the bugles to be sounded all night. The wind was blowing very strongly that night and, rather than billowing out into the plain of Jalalabad, it blew back into the town, and he said that the noise of the trumpets echoing amid the wail of the wind sounded like an elegy to the dead army. The British Empire never had, and never would, experience a defeat like it. The first Afghan war was a major event for the Afghans. We always see it through our perspective as the great imperial disaster, but for the Afghans, this was their Trafalgar, their Battle of Britain, their Waterloo, all in one. They were the only non-colonial power to see off a modern westernised army in the 19th century, on the sort of magnificent scale that they did, and completely destroyed an entire Victorian army at the very peak of Britain's power. For Afghans, this had confirmed that they were a warrior nation, one even capable of seeing off a great power like Britain, but Western historians point to another legacy that resonates today. The first time there's really a feeling of jihad inside Afghanistan is the first Anglo-Afghan war. After that, it never really goes away. Beginning with the British invasions, Afghans begin to perceive themselves as fighting an outside non-Muslim world. Now, they had known this before. When they raided India, that was jihad, you know. You got to go into infidel lands and take home a lot of good stuff. But inside Afghanistan, you couldn't do jihad. Now when these foreigners invaded, people would say, "Yes, we're fighting non-Muslims." The British government would have liked to cover up the extent of this tragedy, but it was not to be. Almost every last grisly detail was immortalised in the bestselling diaries of Lady Sale, wife of one of the senior officers in the Kabul Army. She was captured during the retreat and later released, and her original diaries and letters are kept here in the British Library. I took a look at them with historian Jane Robinson. Well, the book ran into several reprints in the first couple of years. It sold 7,500 copies, which was huge, and it was serialised in The Times. And the response to it was unprecedented, I think, because this was the first time that a woman, a British woman, had written from the theatre of war. Lady Sale's account of the retreat from Kabul was shockingly explicit. To see women and children and soldiers and camp followers in various states of decomposition, and she actually describes it... I see here that some of the text has been excised, I think as possibly being too strong. This was horrific stuff. "Subsequently we heard that scarcely any of these poor wretches escaped "and that, driven to the extreme of hunger, "they'd sustained life by feeding on their dead comrades." And she knew that the army was doomed. She does say earlier on, "I fear "that nobody is going to survive this." The newspaper serialisation sparked a macabre fascination with the savagery of the Afghans. She was a British representative in Kabul. She was part of the establishment there, part of the machine. And the fact that she had been attacked by the Afghans, it meant that the Afghans were particularly dastardly because they had attacked what was most, not sacred, but almost sacred, about British society abroad. But, actually, that's extremely unfair because, in fact, the Afghans went out of their way to save all the women and children. Yes, but that's not what the audience got from this. Not at all. What they saw was the sensation. What they was the dead bodies. What they saw was the cannibalism. Perhaps to limit the damage to our imperial reputation, the British spun this as a story of heroism and bravery. The way this was treated when it was published was, indeed, propaganda, I think. She was paraded before Queen Victoria. There was a city named Sale in Australia. There was a ship named Sale in the Navy. And she was promoted as a heroine. She was made into a celebrity to try and distract, I think. We're defeated, but we turn out of the defeat the fact that we're really lions. Yes, yeah. The British Empire had been humiliated. And the defeat was seared into our historical memory, creating a view of Afghanistan as a graveyard of empire, an unconquerable land. But that's only part of the story, because later that year the British sent an army of retribution, which sought savage revenge for its losses and razed to the ground Kabul's historic bazaar. But, having dealt the Afghans a punishing blow, instead of occupying the country, they ended the first Anglo-Afghan war with a deal. At this point they announce, "Now we're going to withdraw. "But now you can see that if we want to come back, we can do it. "You guys have not defeated us militarily. "Now we need to cut a deal." And they take Dost Mohammad, the ruler that they had dispossessed, they say, "OK, you can go back again." So it's like Dost Mohammad part two, but he tells the British, "I understand your needs. You must understand mine," and the two sides come to a modus vivendi. So, yes, the Afghans can claim a great victory but, on the other hand, the ruler they've put back in power understands what Britain needs to such an extent that when the mutiny occurs in India in 1857, the so-called Sepoy rebellion, and the Afghans are urged to march on Peshawar to ally with the rebels, Dost Mohammad says, "No, I've signed an agreement with the British and, "besides, I think they'll win." The Afghans took enormous pride in their resistance to the British, and the political settlement led to a period of confidence and relative stability, during which time the British and the Afghans treated each other with a wary respect. But the rivalry between Russia and Britain only continued to intensify. A thousand miles from Afghanistan, in 1854, the two powers fought a brutal war in the Crimea. And, if anything, the fears of Russian ambition was growing. Then, in the late 1870s, Russians again appeared in Kabul. A new generation of British hawks decided the only response was again to invade. Again, there was a public outcry. Again, imperial paranoia triumphed and once again a British army, this time 40,000 strong, was marching into Afghanistan. To prevent Kabul being taken, the Afghan emir signed an agreement with the British that a new envoy, Sir Louis Cavagnari, another swashbuckling multilingual officer, was installed in Kabul. Remembering that Burnes had been massacred escaping from his unfortified house in the old city, Cavagnari took up residency in this ancient citadel, the Bala Hisar. Sir Louis Cavagnari, the new British envoy, rode in on his elephant into this citadel with a tiny escort. He'd taken three lessons from the death of his predecessor Alexander Burnes. Always live within the fortified citadel. Don't come in with a large army of occupation, and never touch the local women. But despite all his care, he was soon hearing rumours that the Afghans wanted to kill him. Cavagnari thought he had learned from Burnes that it was better to be in the Bala Hisar, but this was actually the palace of the Afghan kings, and his presence there also caused offence. Here I met up with Prince Ali Seraj, a member of the Afghan royal family whose palace this was. People were not very pleased that a British Ambassador had been put in the Bala Hisar. Why were the angry about that? Because it reminded them of the first Anglo-Afghan war, they forget here comes the British again you know, and they're here to occupy Afghanistan once again. We have never, ever liked to be conquered. We have accepted poverty because we want to be free. They don't understand the Afghan psyche. They forget that they were in India and they took the East Indian Company, you know, were so successful in India, they think, "Oh, Afghanistan, rowdy people with baggy pants and turbans," you know, we're easy to rule, easy to control, but they forgot that Afghanistan is a nation of warriors. I couldn't help asking him if we were making the same mistakes today. There was an American, I'll not say which organisation, he say, "Oh, Prince Ali, I have "received a billion dollars from the United States." I said, "What are you going to do with this money? He said, "Well, we're going to roll "into the village and we're going to build things." I said, "Sir, if you roll into the village, they'll roll you out." I said, "You roll up to the village, "then you send an emissary inside the village, "talk to the elders. They will do one of two things. "Either invite you in or they will send somebody out to meet with you. "Then once they invite you in, you sit down and you talk to them, "but don't tell them what you're going to do. "Ask them what they want. "Respect. If you do that, you will have them in your pocket." The Afghan king who'd negotiated with the British was seen as weak. Ordinary Afghans hated the deal he'd struck with the British and they hated the presence of Cavagnari in Kabul. Finally, an Afghan regiment mutinied and marched on his residence. Cavagnari looked out on the screaming mob, knowing the nearest reinforcements were hundreds of miles away. He led a suicidal charge, was killed, and his mutilated corpse was put on display. Mortified by his death and desperate to salvage their credibility, Britain launched another invasion into Afghanistan. The commander of the lead column, General Roberts, was told "Your objective should be "to strike terror and to strike it swiftly and deeply." Four weeks after the envoy was killed, a Highland Regiment had fought its way to the top of that ridgeline and the next day General Roberts had seized Kabul. He came here to the citadel where he saw the blood-spattered walls and the mangled corpse of the envoy and his comrades. Enraged, General Roberts set up a gallows on the wall. He hanged a hundred Afghans, demolished the palaces of the Afghan nobility and, at that point, with honour satisfied, many suggested he should withdraw. But the Afghan king had been deposed, the country was unstable, Britain had taken responsibility for Afghanistan and leaving no longer seemed an option. While General Roberts sat in Kabul, the countryside was now in revolt. Suddenly, a jihad had been called against them and when they looked out on a winter evening from their small camp in Kabul, they could see right along this ridgeline, 60,000 watch fires burning from Afghans bent on their destruction. It must have seemed as though history was repeating itself exactly, and the one lesson that Britain should be taking away was never to invade Afghanistan. This time, unlike his predecessor, General Roberts decided to stay and fight and he was able, just, to withstand the siege of his compound in Kabul. But in Helmand Province, the Afghans completely defeated and wiped out another British unit, this time in the Battle of Maiwand. It's one of Afghanistan's most famous victories and I met Abbie Aryan, an Afghan living in London, at this British memorial to Maiwand. History has it that the Afghans won because of the rousing battle cry of a young woman called Malalai. She's an ordinary Afghan girl. As she's standing in the battle, she can see that the Afghans are losing and she stood there, took her veil off and said, "If you love your country and if you're a real Pashtun, "and if you don't want to be "ashamed, you have to go and fight the British." Remember when Elizabeth stood in front of Spanish Armada... Uh-huh. ..gave this speech to the British army? Yep. To us, that was equivalent to that. And by revealing her face, actually, in some ways, it's a kind of shame for her and her family, everybody sees her face. But she's going to die so it doesn't matter? Absolutely. And she, in fact, she dies in the battle as well, but the encouragement she gave to the Afghans there was immense. Unlike the massacre of the British army in the retreat from Kabul, Maiwand was not covered in a serialisation in The Times. So although a thousand British soldiers were killed, this memorial in Reading is almost all that remains, and its meaning is now largely forgotten. But ask an Afghan and you get a very different response. This battle, like the retreat from Kabul, is still the stuff of legend. As an Afghan child, as you learn how to walk, you know about the battles we had with the British. Uh-huh. It is part of our DNA. It's part of our life. Maiwand is like a legend in Afghanistan. I think, in a way, the British try to justify it, saying, "Oh, it was really sunny hot day. We didn't have as much as... "Afghans had superior fire power." How can Afghan army have a superior fire power than the British?! British troops fighting in Helmand today are often warned by local Afghans that they will meet the same fate as befell their predecessors in Helmand at Maiwand. We say that all doors are always open for invaders. Look from Alexander The Great, all the way to the British and today. It's really easy to get into Afghanistan. It's just the getting-out part that's very difficult. We always don't mind foreign invaders getting in there, relaxing and feeling comfortable, then we start our fight. This is our traditional way of doing things. What do you think an Afghan villager feels they're fighting for? For their home and country. For their independence. They don't like foreign invading army to come through their villages. To do it with your mighty force and say, "Look, I'm here, I'm going to provide you peace and security." This is a joke, honestly is, because nobody believe that. Afghans wouldn't accept that - as how can somebody bring peace with a gun and weapons? You can't do that. A thousand British soldiers had been massacred at the Battle of Maiwand, the war was turning against Britain, but the response this time was immediate. There followed one of the most celebrated marches of the entire Victorian era, General Roberts, with an elite band of Ghurkhas and Highlanders, set off from Kabul, through unknown territory with no support. 320 miles, in 20 days, in 100-degree heat, arrived safe at Kandahar, and won a decisive victory that brought the second Anglo-Afghan war to a close. Having won a victory, the question was, what would Britain do next? All the fears, all the pride that had dragged them into Afghanistan was still there. They'd spent blood and treasure. There were so many reasons to try to continue an occupation and yet they decided to declare a victory and get out. And this is because, despite all these fears, the British Empire had a lot of people who knew the region well, who spoke the languages well, who understood their limits, who understood that it couldn't be done. And nobody summed it up better than General Roberts himself. He said, "We have nothing to fear from Afghanistan "and, offensive though it may be to our pride, the less they see of us, "the less they will dislike us." After decades of battling Russian influence in Afghanistan, the British Empire, at the peak of its power, bowed to Afghan realities and struck a deal with their opponent. Just as in 1842, Britain again allowed the most powerful Afghan leader to take the throne, even though he was their enemy. Abdur Rahman was an ally of the Russians and had been living on Russian soil, but he was the only man who seemed to have the support and authority to control the country. It's as though after ten years of fighting the Taliban today, the United States and their allies left Afghanistan and put the Taliban back in charge. This extraordinary gamble paid off. For his part, the new king, Abdur Rahman, demanded a massive subsidy and no internal interference in his country. In return, Britain got control of Afghan foreign policy and, most importantly, Abdur Rahman did not allow the Russians to threaten British India. For Britain, it was a perfect solution. And even when Europe descended into the First World War, Afghanistan remained neutral. But this would change in the aftermath of that Great War, as the great powers of Europe met here in Versailles. Here, empires were broken up, new nation states were created, and Afghanistan, although excluded from the negotiating table, had its own ambitions. For the first time, Afghanistan, so often on the receiving end of British firepower, itself became the principle aggressor. The new king of Afghanistan saw Britain exhausted by war, facing unrest in India. He called another jihad, took his chance, and invaded British India through the Khyber Pass. Although Britain saw off this unexpected aggression, they suffered twice as many casualties as the Afghans. But with Russia no longer the threat of old, Britain saw less need for an interest in Afghanistan and granted the Afghans full independence. But what Afghanistan did with that independence was the opposite of what the British expected. The new king, Amanullah, revealed himself to be a moderniser. The British policy was really to keep Afghanistan locked in the Middle Ages. The last thing they wanted was Afghanistan to change and modernise and then, suddenly, in 1919, modernity came. British ideas came to Afghanistan against Britain's will, and this great process of modernisation came not through the empire, came not through British bayonets, but through an Afghan king. King Amanullah ruled from this extravagant palace in a European style, which he built on the outskirts of Kabul, and he championed a new modernising intellectual elite in Afghanistan. But the country that he was determined to transform had changed little in the century that had passed since Britain first took an interest here. It was a country with almost blanket illiteracy, a fragmented country of isolated villages and mountain valleys under feudal rule, the way Britain had found it and left it. Dreaming of modernity, in 1927, Amanullah embarks on a grand European tour, the first such trip by an Afghan ruler. The Afghan king arrived in Britain for a full state visit. The flags were out and a slightly anxious British government responded in time-honoured fashion by taking him to shop for guns and for cars, which his impoverished country could hardly afford. And when he toured the Rolls Royce factory, he bought a fleet of cars to take back home. It started a long love affair between Afghan royalty and Rolls Royce. And this car was later part of their fleet, now owned by businessman Richard Raynsford. For an Afghan, possessing this car shows that you are part of an international group. You're no longer part of an isolated country at the other end of the world. Well, that's right. He was a very sophisticated man. When he went to Europe in 1928, he was not just looking for Rolls Royce cars, he was looking, really, to...means to be inspired by the west to how he could modernise his very backward country. And, therefore, the Rolls Royce trip to the Derby works was part of that overall quest for inspiration and for modernisation. A car like this at the time was a pretty expensive thing. It would cost as much as a house in Fulham. About £1,500 for the chassis and another £1,500, even more, up to 2,000, for the body, depending on how exotic a body was ordered by the excited owner. What would an Afghan have felt, looking at this kind of car? It'd be like looking at something equivalent to the space shuttle, I imagine, to an Afghanistan farmer or peasant. 'I think it's tempting today when we look at a car like this 'to imagine Amanullah as some sort of corrupt dictator 'who was spraying money around on Rolls Royces,' but in fact, really, this is part of his love of technology or machinery. It's as though he's returning to the country with a jet engine or a new computer system. He's coming back with whole new interests in railways and printing machines, and mining technology and medicine, but for the conservatives in Afghanistan, this is all very dangerous and very dubious. The big story that's spreading through the streets when he arrives is he's bringing back a new machine to turn human corpses into soap. Amanullah was just beginning to discover how conservative his country still was. Wild rumours were circulating about how he had become a Catholic, ate pork, drank alcohol. He became perceived as a foreigner in his own land, attempting to impose a foreign ideology on his own people. It's easy to laugh at Amanullah and, indeed, there's a lot that you can laugh at him for. For example, he gathered the tribal elders and insisted they wore pinstriped trousers and western jackets, but there was also a highly developed serious programme of reform. In fact, the most radical programme for state transformation in Afghanistan came from an Afghan. He wanted parliamentary elections, a progressive constitution, education, particularly for women. And, in the end, when photographs were circulated in the bazaar of his wife, the queen, with her head uncovered, with pearls over a plunging neckline, he had to flee, the wheels of that new Rolls Royce spinning vainly in the snow, to exile in Italy. It is ironic, when, today, we're concerned with the powerful hold of Islam and the problems of establishing democracy in that country, that the only attempt in this whole period to modernise and democratise Afghanistan didn't come from British rule, but from the Afghans themselves. So why did the British go into Afghanistan in the 19th century? It wasn't really about Afghanistan in the end. It was about the fears of empire, fear of empty space, fear of the Russians, fear in the end about their own credibility, their pride. In the second film, two superpowers come calling, and these armies invade Afghanistan, not just to protect their selfish strategic aims, but also with the objective of bringing profound social change, and reshaping Afghanistan more in their own image. And the result for the people of Afghanistan, and their invaders, was to be even greater horror and tragedy. If you were going to pass a message to the American and British troops today, what would you say to them? 'Afghanistan, one of the most isolated, 'barren landscapes on Earth. 'And for three of the greatest powers the world has ever seen, 'an unlikely target, an enduring obsession 'and an unwinnable war.' In the 21st century, a US-led coalition attacked and is still mired there. In the 19th century, it was the British Empire who invaded and suffered an agonising defeat. And in the 20th century, with communism dominating almost half the globe, Soviet Russia decided to invade. Their mission, to quell the growing Afghan insurgency, stabilise the government, train the Afghan Army and leave. They thought it would take 12 months. Nine years later, after more than a million Afghans had been killed, all the Soviet Union could look back on was humiliation. Like the British in the 19th century and the US-led coalition today, the Soviets found themselves trapped and fighting a fierce resistance. HE SHOUTS If you were going to pass a message to the American and British troops today, what would you say to them? IN RUSSIAN: 'After the British experience in the 19th century, 'Afghanistan was dubbed "the Graveyard of Empires." 'So why did two superpowers invade in the 20th and 21st centuries 'and once again make Afghanistan a place of tragedy?' EXPLOSION For many in the West, Afghanistan is now synonymous with war. A land where soldiers go to die. A place which is believed to represent such an overwhelming threat to the security of the West that over 100,000 western soldiers are currently stationed here, in a war costing $130 billion a year. It's a million miles from the vision of the country I had as a child... '..because when Afghanistan first entered my consciousness, 'it was as a place of peace.' This place, Istalif, was one of the great tourist traps on the hippie trail. My mother came here in the 1960s, my sister in the 1970s, and when I visit people often in suburban houses in England, I see the distinctive blue ceramics that they bought. For travellers, this was a very peaceful place where they experienced the generosity of Afghans. All the people who came on that overland trail as hippies were feeling that they were living in a beautiful bubble, a land that time forgot. A Shangri-La where you could go to have a relaxed time, smoke some drugs and buy some woolly jackets. But a peaceful Afghanistan wasn't just a hippie mirage. 'In Boston, I've come to meet an anthropologist and historian 'who spent a lot of time travelling in Afghanistan in the 1970s, 'Professor Tom Barfield.' You had this perfectly peaceful Afghanistan where I, as a foreigner, could travel unarmed all over the country and there was never any trouble. And I never saw anybody armed. Now, people look back on it as a golden age. It was a time of peace and security where people went about their business. From 1929 to 1978, Afghanistan has 50 years of peace. Most European countries can't make that statement in the mid-20th century. Afghanistan was absolutely at peace. 'God expressed his love for all the children of mankind. 'May the life of these children of Afghanistan be a happy life.' But while it was a peaceful place, it was not a unified one because, outside the cities, Afghanistan was, and remains, in many ways, a country of 20,000 diverse, isolated villages, where every village chief is almost a king. That was the case when the British invaded in the 19th century. It was still pretty much the case when the hippies came in the 1960s and '70s. And it was definitely what I found when I walked across Afghanistan at the end of 2001. These self-contained communities posed little danger to the outside world. But by the 1960s, foreign governments were beginning to take a very threatening interest in Afghanistan because, once again, they were perceiving it as a key strategic point for empires, a centre point in the Cold War dividing the new superpowers, the Soviet Union, from the allies of the United States. Afghanistan was surrounded. To the north, the Soviet Union. East and west, the US allies Iran and Pakistan. And while the Americans feared a Soviet push south in search of a warm water port and oil reserves, the Soviets assumed that America was going to inspire instability on their southern border. And so, both powers tried to bring Afghanistan under their influence, sending in billions of roubles and dollars of economic support. In the snowy countryside outside of Moscow, 'I've come to meet a man who spent much of his career in Afghanistan 'helping to coordinate economic development in the country 'in the 1960s, Soviet economic adviser, Valeri Ivanov.' With projects like this, Afghanistan became the fourth largest recipient of Soviet aid anywhere in the world. But, at the same time, in the south of the country, the United States was also constructing dams and housing. Two superpowers jockeying for influence in a far smaller country, as indeed they were doing again and again across the world, because the Cold War stretched from Berlin to Korea, Latin America to Indochina. 'Communism denies religion and debases the individual 'to a part of a vast machine that powers the state. 'Children are taken early and moulded to fit the machine. 'Here is no search for truth.' 'As communism and capitalism clashed, 'foreign aid flowing into Afghanistan 'paid for places like this - Kabul University. 'Here, many of the bright young minds of Afghanistan, 'hungry for new ideas, 'were excited by the opportunity to bring rapid change to their country. 'Some focused on communism,' others immersed themselves in political Islam, an ideology rejecting both the Soviet Union and the United States. The university became a hotbed of Afghan radicalism. In the 1970s, the peaceful gardens and foreign-funded buildings here at Kabul University had been taken over by radicals, Maoist and Leninist students marching in the streets. And over there, professors funded by Egyptian Muslims training on Kalashnikovs. Islamists and communists, in a race to see who could kick over the traces of the old Afghanistan and create their new paradise. And it was the communists who got there first, infiltrating the army and, in April 1978, taking control of the country. Communism was a foreign idea, but it was Afghans themselves and not foreigners who implemented it. They believed ideology would transform their country. And coming to power, the new Communist president, Nur Mohammad Taraki, announced a manifesto of staggering ambition - secular education, equality for women and with wild optimism, he predicted the mosques would be empty within a year. 'In Kabul, I've come to meet Hamidullah Tarzi, 'who was a minister in these first Afghan Communist cabinets. 'And I wanted to talk to him about the wisdom and the speed 'of some of these extraordinary reforms.' And education for women and literacy? Why did people resist them? Why was there a resistance? 'When people tried to resist the revolution, 'the Afghan communists responded with terror, 'brutally driving through their reforms. 'And nothing symbolises the horror of their rule more than this, 'the PuliCharki Prison.' It almost feels inappropriate to be here. I have a friend in Kabul who had 71 members of his family executed in the courtyard adjoining this building. The few months after the Afghan communists took power, 12,000 Afghans had been arrested, put in Kabul prisons and were then executed. 'And this contained at one time 15,000 prisoners, 'many of them political prisoners. 'The contrast between this brutal, rigid concrete prison, 'and the reality of rural Afghanistan, 'the mud houses, the villages, 'in the centre of which this sat, 'some great modern horror.' It's the brutal arrival of a modern state trying to impose its ideology on a country. By 1979, the Afghan communists were facing growing unrest, particularly in the more conservative, religious countryside outside Kabul. Their followers were beginning to mutiny and they were losing control. Finally, the Afghan president, Nur Mohammad Taraki, flew to Moscow to see his friend and ally, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, and he pled with the Soviets to send troops to Afghanistan to prop up and secure this Communist revolution. But the reaction was not what you might expect. You would have thought that the revolution in Afghanistan in 1978 would have been a great moment for the Soviet Union. Suddenly, a new communist country had emerged in the late 1970s. The Cold War, you would have thought, was swinging in their direction. But, actually, the reaction that came here in the Kremlin was not one of celebration, not one of popping champagne corks, but profound nervousness and trepidation about what Afghanistan had got itself into, and what this would mean for the Soviet Union. 'And the historical records of the Politburo have now been released, 'confirming just how bewildered and anxious the Russians were. 'Again and again, the documents show the Foreign Minister, 'the Intelligence Minister and the Defence Minister saying' that if the Soviet Union got involved, it would firstly spark Muslim resentment. It would turn the Afghan government into a puppet. And it would destroy the Soviet Union's reputation around the world. And yet, in the end, despite all these fears, Brezhnev considered invasion. 'A man who saw Russia's interaction with Afghanistan first-hand 'was Sir Rodric Braithwaite, later Britain's Ambassador to Moscow.' The crucial incident was when Taraki, the president, who was a sort of favourite of Brezhnev's, the then Soviet leader, was assassinated by his number two, Amin. And Brezhnev took that very personally. He had vowed to protect this guy, this guy ended up dead. Amin was out of control. IN RUSSIAN: A decision was taken absolutely at the last minute. There was a great outcry that the CIA had failed to predict it, but they, they couldn't predict something that the Russians themselves hadn't yet decided to do. 'Christmas Eve 1979, 'Soviet Special Forces exploded into the Afghan presidential palace.' Up through the gardens, swarming in through the windows, shooting the President's bodyguard and then the President himself. 80,000 Soviet troops followed, flowing across the borders, and the world looked on in horror. This is a callous violation of international law. It is a deliberate effort of a powerful atheistic government to subjugate an independent Islamic people. Why did the Soviet Union finally make the decision to send in their troops? The answer is that, like all empires, they didn't want to look weak. This was a mini-communist state, an ally on their borders, and they couldn't let Afghanistan collapse. Something had to be done. We underestimate the sense of insecurity that all empires feel. We were terrified at the end of the 19th century, at the height of British imperialism, that somebody, the Germans or somebody was going take it all away from us. And I think that's, that affects policymaking in empires at the imperial level. So you see a threat. You think, "Well, if we don't deal with it now, "it'll come round and bite us from behind." And I think Afghanistan falls into that category. But for every wary and neurotic politician, there was a Soviet soldier confident of success. And none more so than the vanguard, the Soviet parachute regiment, or "Blue Berets," the cream of the Soviet military. Among these veterans are many men who were involved in that invasion. This is the 25th anniversary concert of the Blue Beret Band. And almost everybody in the audience is somebody who has either been in the military or is related to someone in the military. APPLAUSE IN RUSSIAN: Like many American and British soldiers today, these troops felt they were part of a bigger mission to modernise and change Afghanistan for the better. IN RUSSIAN: These invading soldiers were told their mission was to support the new Afghan Communist government and that the intervention would be over in a year. But they'd completely underestimated the Afghan reaction. EXPLOSION The Afghans turned against these foreigners, just as they had against the British in the 19th century. This was driven partly by nationalism, but religion was also a key factor. The Russians made this very easy because the Soviet Union was a declared atheist state so they... "We are atheists, "we actually have a Bureau of Atheism!" Wow, it's easy. So we're fighting against these atheist communists, so that was easy to talk about, it was placing the war in a jihad context. When Afghans try to explain why they fought the Russians, they often talk about religion. 'Here I've come to meet a group of six Mujahideen 'from a poor village 90 miles from Kabul. 'They're almost all that remains of a unit which was once nearly 50 men, 'most of whom were killed in the fight against the Russians. 'This is how they explain their war.' 'Many in the Soviet capital had agonised 'over the decision to invade Afghanistan. 'Many in the Politburo itself warned it was a trap. 'So was the growing insurgency 'confirmation that the sceptics had been right? 'In Moscow, I've come to meet a man 'who was on the frontline of the Soviet war. 'One of Russia's most decorated and respected war heroes, 'General Ruslan Aushev.' IN RUSSIAN: In one of these attacks on this beautiful district of Panjshir, the Soviets entered with nearly 400 aircraft and helicopters, carpet bombing the valley floor and following up with 13,000 troops. But the Mujahideen had simply disappeared and when the Soviets left, they returned. HE SHOUTS EXPLOSION AND GUNFIRE The resistance of the Mujahideen was about to become even more formidable, for they had a new ally, the unlikeliest friend, because the United States had spotted an opportunity to strike a blow to their enemy in the Cold War. Running the CIA in Asia at this time was Chuck Cogan. The Soviets were taking advantage of our perceived weakness and were advancing on all fronts - the Cuban proxies in Angola, the other advances in the Horn of Africa, and it seemed as though we were, we had lost momentum. And then, at the end of the '70s, in '79, this opportunity arose in Afghanistan when the Pakistan Intelligence Service approached us and asked if we could help support the Mujahideen, the rebels who had risen up against the Communist government. When this opportunity arose in Afghanistan, I mean, the watchword was revenge. Revenge above all for Vietnam. The communist governments had supported the resistance in Vietnam, and 58,000 Americans had been killed in this faraway land, in the first ever humiliation of the United States. Now, six years later, the US saw a chance to give the Soviet Union a taste of their own medicine. We felt that somehow if we could sort of right this balance and inflict as much damage as possible on Russian soldiers, this would be a sort of a semi-vindication. Cogan authorised a plan to covertly supply weapons across the Pakistani border to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, but only weapons that could not be traced back to the US. And Cogan agreed the plan directly with Pakistan's military ruler, General Zia. This Afghan covert action programme run by the agency would never have gotten off the ground without Zia. And I can remember meeting Zia in Zia's rather modest bungalow in Rawalpindi. And during the meeting, Zia brought out this huge map of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and he put a red template over the southern part of where Afghanistan touches Pakistan and Iran. The Pakistanis always want to have an influence in Afghanistan, as an insurance against India, and as a sort of rearguard for themselves, they decided to help the Mujahideen. And at the same time Zia used another simile which he used frequently, and that is, "The pot should be kept boiling, but should not boil over." In other words, the Soviets should not be antagonised by this amount of, huge amount of weaponry to the point that they would intervene to attack across the border into Pakistan or some other action, air attacks, and we were very conscious of this. For that reason, Cogan's operation remained relatively small and secret and in itself, it would have had only a modest effect upon the outcome of the Afghan-Soviet war. 'But, at this point, the Islamist Afghans 'acquired the most unexpected anti-communist ally of all - 'the Christian, Texan, wealthy socialite, Joanne Herring.' There's very few champions like Miss Herring. That's right, that's right. The man you just met is one of the richest men in Houston... Right. ..and he is wonderful. He does so much and, and I'm working on him for Afghanistan. This is an evening which both shows Joanne Herring as part of the Texan elite with whom she raises money at gala dinners like this and through whom she influences policy, but it's also a reminder that she is a very unique individual. She is somebody who almost single-handedly created the entire American support for the Mujahideen during the Afghan war. 'The CIA was of course already involved with the resistance, 'but it was this society hostess 'which took it into a different league financially. 'And she did it for the most improbable reasons 'and in the most unlikely way.' I worked with the Afghan poor in the mountains. I felt that they were an honourable people, and that they valued honour, but they valued freedom more than anything on Earth. And when you think of the juggernauts that they have faced, Great Britain was the strongest country in the world, the sun never set, really, on the British flag. And they were now facing, when I was there, the greatest build-up of military might in history and they were willing to fight to the death against that with pitchforks, so to speak. Joanne Herring's mission was to make sure it wasn't pitchforks or ancient rifles that the Mujahideen had to fight with, but that they could take on the Soviet military with the latest in 20th century weaponry. And the secret of her success was one relationship in particular. So, guess who I was dating? SHE CHUCKLES Charlie! The minute Charlie heard about it, wow! He understood the communists, and he wanted to stop them too. Joanne Herring's boyfriend happened to be Texan Congressman Charlie Wilson. And crucially, he sat on the Congressional Committee which set the budgets for the CIA covert operations. And what happened next was brilliantly portrayed in the Hollywood film Charlie Wilson's War. What do you want me to do, Joanne? This is what I want you to do. I want you to save Afghanistan for the Afghans. I want you to deliver such a crushing defeat to the Soviets that communism crumbles and, in so doing, end the Cold War. I'll tell you, I'd do it too, but I've got this Dairy Queen problem in Nacogdoches. Don't underestimate me, Charlie. Believe everything you've heard. What exactly do you want me to do? Go to Pakistan and meet with Zia. Zia? Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. He's the President of Pakistan! I've already arranged it. With Joanne Herring's help, Charlie Wilson lobbied and cajoled the committee, and persuaded them to channel incredible quantities of funds, in secret, to the Mujahideen. Total US funding for the resistance went from five million to nine billion dollars. It became the largest covert operation in US history. But Charlie Wilson never pretended to have a deep understanding of Afghanistan itself, let alone its problems. When I try to think about Charlie Wilson, I tend to come back to this building, because this, the Lincoln Memorial, with the Gettysburg Address on the wall, was Charlie Wilson's favourite place in DC. And when he talks about Afghanistan, he said that the war in Afghanistan was like Gettysburg. How could Charlie Wilson think that a bundle of mountains in central Afghanistan, 10,000 miles away, was like Gettysburg? Somehow, though, in his mind, he was a hero, he was Lincoln, and what was happening in Afghanistan seemed to him something that threatened the very survival of the United States. These Texan anti-communists who spoke of their common cause with the Mujahideen, romantically painting them as religious freedom fighters, were really only using Afghanistan as a proxy for their fight with Soviet Russia. But the billions of dollars of US funding, matched dollar for dollar by Saudi Arabia and the supply routes and safe havens provided by Pakistan transformed the fortunes of the Afghan resistance. Now, the Soviets faced not just a popular resistance, but a guerrilla army equipped with the latest in military hardware. And when America started supplying Stinger and other anti-aircraft missiles to the Mujahideen, they started bringing down Soviet helicopters. But it was the mines, or what we would call today IEDs, that the Soviets remember. And Afghans had become the specialists in mines they still are today. 'General Muslim led the Afghan resistance 'in this part of the Panjshir valley.' The bulk of Soviet supplies came by roads like these and the Mujahideen attacks began to kill thousands of Soviet soldiers and cut off their supply routes. The Russians began to call this conflict a war of mines. The Soviet army brought in helicopters, experimented with new tactics, took the most brutal revenge against villages, but they were never able to defeat the insurgents. The Russian Special Forces that landed from helicopters on these ridgelines were some of the toughest, most courageous, best trained troops in the world. And yet, they never really saw their enemy. They were attacked with mines, people shot into their tents at night, they were suddenly ambushed with rockets. And when they wanted to put all their military training, all their courage, all their energy into action, they felt they were fighting an army of ghosts. 'And so, if the Soviet tactics hadn't worked, 'weren't working, and weren't going to work, 'why did they continue?' A British ambassador once said to me that the US and its allies could not leave Afghanistan because they had lost too much blood and treasure. And the same thought has been in the minds of people for centuries here. GUNFIRE Because when empires begin to lose, begin to spend, begin to have soldiers killed, begin to make promises, begin to produce justifications, it becomes more and more difficult for them to leave. And they end up simply piling more corpses on top of their soldiers' bodies in the hope that this can somehow justify their loss. In very blunt terms, those soldiers are dead and gone, and they're never coming back, and you can never honour soldiers by piling more corpses on top of their head. But no general feels this, no politician can say this, and so the killing and the occupation continues far longer than it ever should. At home, the Soviets tried to conceal the failures and brutality of this occupation. The public was told the Soviets were popular, were helping the Afghan people and that the rebels were only a small minority of terrorists. In a Moscow library, I met with Vladimir Vyatkin, a state photographer sent to Afghanistan in the 1980s. 'When he began to take photographs and ask questions about the war, 'he was sent home and banned from further travel.' How much was he able to see of Kabul? SHE TRANSLATES QUESTION INTO RUSSIAN IN RUSSIAN: As the Soviets tried to maintain the illusion that Afghanistan was a largely peaceful mission, dead bodies were returned to Russia, sealed in unopenable zinc coffins and delivered to their families at night. 'Finally, Mikhail Gorbachev, who became General Secretary in 1985, 'made the decision to withdraw. 'It was the right decision and a courageous one. 'But he had many interests to manage, not least the military, 'who were demanding more time and more resources. 'So the deadline was set three years out for 1988.' The parallels between Gorbachev and Obama are really striking. In both cases they come in, they accept that it's not going well. In both cases they do a mini-surge, they say to the military, "We're going to give you a little more time and more troops, "we're going to try harder." Under Gorbachev, the amount of expenditure on Afghanistan in fact goes up, but at the same time they're setting a deadline, and a deadline that completely erodes their authority. So between these two impossibilities, the impossibility of winning and the impossibility of acknowledging that you can't win, all the tragedy of Obama and Gorbachev emerges. If you were going to pass a message to the American and British troops today, what would you say to them? But the route out of Afghanistan is never quick or straight. Although it was now clear that Russia was withdrawing, it would still be years before the final soldier left. And whilst the bloodletting continued, no-one really believed in the project any more. Half as many soldiers died again following the decision to withdraw. By the time they leave, there's nobody there to greet them. Nobody from the Department of Defence, nobody from the Politburo, nobody from the party. They've sacrificed 25,000 lives for the ideal of the Soviet Union and not a single person pays them the courtesy of meeting them at the border. 'The Afghan war may not have brought down the Soviet Empire, 'but the war had dealt it a major blow, 'both financially and to its prestige. 'And the Politburo was embarrassed 'even to honour the sacrifice of its soldiers.' This is the great monument to the Soviet soldiers of the Second World War. For generations now, Soviet soldiers have come to this flame to remember their sacrifice and their victory. But the Afghansti, the Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan, returned to a different world. They came from an almost shameful, secret war, 'and the million who returned, many of them psychologically damaged, 'returned to a Soviet Union that was itself collapsing.' Now, 12 years later, veterans of Afghanistan still meet in places like this, Moscow's Kombat Bar. I wanted to sit with them and find out 'what these veterans thought 'all this killing and sacrifice had been for.' IN RUSSIAN: Could you ask a little about whether they felt that they were trying to modernise the Afghan state? But many of these other veterans were much more sceptical about their mission and the ideology behind it. HE SINGS 'But elsewhere, others were celebrating. 'The US felt it had won a war 'without losing a single American soldier, 'for it was Afghans who had fought on their behalf. 'Hundreds of thousands had died 'and Afghanistan had been left with a shattered economy and government. 'Would the US take responsibility for Afghanistan in the future? 'The man who ran the CIA's covert action in the latter part of the war 'now lives in rural Vermont. 'He's never spoken publicly about Afghanistan before 'and I wanted to ask Tom Twetten about the American post-war plan.' We have this sort of piece of paper in our system, which is called "the finding," that is signed by the President. Our finding on the Afghanistan said, "Push the Russians out, "support the Afghans, give them all the support they need", but it didn't say anything about what came next. I can remember being present at a congressional hearing in which one Congressman actually said, "So what party are you going to back?" And we said, "Well, that's not our problem, we don't do that." We're a tool of foreign policy. That covert action tool worked, was successful in this case, and then over to you, diplomats. That was a problem of really bad timing, because '88, '89, the wall came down in Berlin. It was the major event of the 20th century, the end of the Cold War, really, and Afghanistan fell off the bottom. There were no funds for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, but what the Americans did leave was modern weaponry, some in the hands of Islamists increasingly connected to global terror networks. There was one goal that trumped all others - help the Afghans defend their soil, kill the Russians. Who was there to do it? They were all Islamists, and we didn't spend much time thinking about, you know, what degree of Islamist is it that we can't tolerate? Twetten's CIA had avoided the trap of outright occupation. But they had worked within a dangerously narrow and limited vision, funding brutal warlords, men linked to terrorists who would eventually kill thousands across the world. But the first to reap the consequences were not the Americans, but the Afghans themselves. Ten years of Soviet occupation had left Kabul largely intact. But when the Mujahideen seized the capital, they turned on each other, firing rockets from the ridgelines, destroying the very city and killing the very families they'd fought to liberate. The civil war, perhaps the very darkest period in Afghan history, lasted for five long years. 'I asked these Afghan men 'about its impact on their lives and their city.' IN DARI: It was out of this dark period that the Taliban emerged, believers in a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Many were the orphan children of the Soviet war, taught in fundamentalist schools. They captured 90% of the country in just two and a half years. They're infamous today for their brutality, but many Afghans were at first grateful that the Taliban had won, because they ended the rule of the warlords, the gangster militias and the civil war. 'I'm afraid many people 'in the centre of the old city of Kabul felt like that.' After three years of seeing these great heroic leaders, the resistance against the Soviet Union, turned into these monsters of depravity, corruption, power and killing, the Taliban seemed a relief. But for millions of Afghans, Taliban rule was hell. They banned girls from school, forced women to hide even their faces and they inflicted the most terrifying punishments. And yet, the West did not interfere. It wasn't the Taliban's cruelty that led to the next foreign invasion, it was this. The mastermind of 9/11 first came to Afghanistan to fight for Islam against the Soviet Union. He wasn't an Afghan, nor were the 9/11 hijackers, but the Taliban government gave them refuge. Once again, a superpower invaded and this time with good reason - to get Al Qaeda. The coalition brought many improvements to Afghanistan, particularly in the early days, but the US soon faced the almost irresistible temptations of empire. Like the Soviets, they were tempted to reshape Afghanistan ever more in their own image. And when the resistance began against them, like Britain and the Soviets before them, the coalition did not want to seem weak. And, once again, another superpower and its allies were trapped into investing more and more into Afghanistan. Now, the Taliban has formed again and the country faces more upheaval or even civil war. We're on our way to find Mullah Rocketi. He's a Taliban commander who took the name Rocketi because he used to fire a lot of rockets. 'The last time I met a Taliban commander, 'people pulled guns on me and, and threatened to kill me. 'This time, I'm really hoping for more of a political discussion.' I found him in reflective mood thinking back on the invasion and the cycle of Afghan politics. Three mighty imperial powers, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and the United States, all came here, occupied and were trapped. For each, over the last 200 years, it was easy to enter Afghanistan, but proved very difficult to get out. In Boston's Helmand Restaurant, 'owned by the sister of the Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, 'I reflected on these two centuries of Afghan history 'with my friend, the historian Tom Barfield.' Foreigners always coming into Afghanistan think, "We have just what the Afghans need", and are surprised that the people aren't buying it. And a little bit more knowledge would be, there is nothing that has been tried militarily or civilian in Afghanistan that two empires before haven't already succeeded or failed at doing. A little knowledge of that would be like, "Been there, done that." Or, you know, "This road leads to a bad end." The price paid in these wars by the people of Afghanistan is unimaginable. A self-contained country targeted repeatedly by imperial powers, left with its society shattered and over a million Afghan dead. This suffering and the intervention of all these foreigners, Victorian British and Soviet Russian, CIA and Bin Laden, and the current coalition of nations, has shaped modern Afghanistan. But, ultimately, this is a story that reveals, for me, less about Afghanistan itself and more about the foreigners. There's something about invasion, particularly invasion of Afghanistan, which means that you go in very briefly and you get trapped because all these theories, your fear of Muslim terrorists, your fear of some other great superpower, your worries about your own pride, trap you in that country. And from that point onwards, there's nothing that you feel you can do other than to dig ever and more futilely deeper. Afghanistan has been for so many men a place of heroism, self-sacrifice. And yet, in the end, all this energy, all this courage, was in pursuit of something which is simply wrong.
