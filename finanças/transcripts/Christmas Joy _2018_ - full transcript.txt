Rip-Fixes-Sync VaVooM Hey, Joy! Ready? You bet. Let's go knock the socks off Weatherton's. Okay, we are coming to the end of our time as a focus group, but I just want to pose one last question. Since you're all shoppers of Weatherton's, how would you sum up your experience? I love it, especially at Christmas. Yes, I just love the Weatherton's store. They do such a wonderful job of making it feel warm and welcoming. But classy, too. You know you're getting the best. Well, that's wonderful to hear. That's very valuable. Now, how would you say the Weatherton's experience is different from other stores? It's one of the stores I make a point of going into. You can't really know if something's right unless you see yourself in it. I still prefer to do my Christmas shopping online, but I'll come in for the hot cocoa bar. That does seem to be quite popular. Okay, I think that about covers it. Thank you so much for your time. - Where's your research director? - Margie Carter? She couldn't make it this time. Or last time either, as I recall. Joy is very good at this. They're ready for you upstairs, Mrs. Weatherton. Mrs. Weatherton? - Had to go to a meeting. - Probably for the best. Margie doesn't like it when we talk to the clients. - Mrs. Weatherton mentioned you. - Me? Specifically? She thought you were doing a good job with the focus group. Well, I should be, I've done enough to last a lifetime. Not for much longer. That's not guaranteed. You've been working 24/7 since I've known you. They're going to announce your promotion at the Christmas Gala, and you know it. We'll see. - Do you have your dress yet? - For The Gala? Who's had time to shop? Why? Do you? No, but it just so happens, we did a focus group at a legendary department store, so... I love shopping at Weatherton's. So cute. I know... That is pretty. It's just like the dress I was thinking of for the Gala. My mom gave me a Christmas ornament once that was exactly this color. It looks very expensive. But this is my dress. That's one of my favorites this year. Mrs. Weatherton! Hello, Joy. Renee. Good to see you're a shopper at Weatherton's as well. Of course. So, about earlier, how did you think the focus group went? As you know, we have to read the transcripts and write up the report... Yes, I do know all that. I've been a MacDonald-Webber client for many years. But I want to know what you think. Gut instinct. How did they respond to shopping here at Weatherton's, in store? Very positive. People love your store, especially this time of year. I remember once when I was a little girl, my mom drove four hours out of the way to bring me Christmas shopping here. It's one of my favorite memories. You can't recreate that on a website, no matter how hard you try. This particular shade of green will look perfect on you. - Is the car ready? - Yes, Mrs. Weatherton... You shouldn't have said anything. - I know, Margie, I'm sorry... - I know, she put you on the spot. What's going on? It's not like her to be so... insistent. Poppy Weatherton is considering expanding Weatherton's outside of the D.C. area. - That's a good idea... - Not good idea. Cyber shopping is the arc of the future, not stores. All of our research shows that. But Weatherton's isn't like most other stores. People actually like going there. I realize your mother took you there when you were little, and it's a very sweet story, but completely incidental to the MacDonald-Webber overall assessment. - We deal in data, Joy. - I know. Just make sure that our reports reflect those facts, ...not your personal sentiment. Understand? Happy holidays, Crystal Falls. It's a beautiful North Carolina morning and to celebrate the Christmas season, tune in as we keep an eye on the temperatures, we may be getting a white Christmas, but... Hey! ...But tune in later, we'll tell you all about it. Good morning, Ben. Good morning. Be sure they save some of that for me to do later. You never get enough Christmas, do you? Never. Aunt Ruby... Merry Christmas. Five times lucky in the Cookie Crawl, Ben. Let's do it again. Here are the bids for the top three medical records service companies. Thanks. And where are we with your temp replacement? Karen's ready to go as soon as this lil' guy is. Which is after Christmas, right? Well, we're in that final two-week window, so... maybe? You were totally thinking about your mom and the gingerbread contest. - Does that make me a bad boss? - No. No, but what's done is done. It's your turn to participate. Your mom is counting on you. The entries are complete, the decorating team has been picked and knows what to do. Relax, you have a judge other than yourself this year. But you have to be at the contest. I'm gonna do my best, but I'm not the only one with a say in this matter. I know, and... if I have to take over judging responsibilities myself again, I will. I'm sure Mom will understand. No, she won't. You're the best! Thank you so much. Hey, how'd it go yesterday with Margie? I don't know why I kept blabbering on about Poppy Weatherton. Sorry. Hello? Joy? Joy, hi! It's... It's Shirley Andrews. Mrs. Andrews, hi! How are you? I'm fine, I'm good, but, I'm afraid your aunt isn't. What's wrong? Well... she was reaching for some supplies for the Cookie Crawl, and she... she slipped and broke her ankle. Well, is she okay? Can I talk to her? No, no, I'm just home getting a few things, but I want to get back to the hospital before her surgery. Surgery? Look, I don't want you to worry about this, Joy, she's gonna be fine. She told me she didn't want me to call you and worry you, but... but I figured you're family, you should know. Yes, absolutely. Thank you so much. Okay, bye, Joy. What's going on? My aunt got hurt. I have to go. Do you want me to write the Weatherton's report? No, that's okay. I have my laptop, I'll write it when I get to Crystal Falls. Crystal Falls? It's the closest thing I have to a home. Wait... Are you okay? Yeah... Ben? Hey, Joy. Ben Andrews? Long time no see. Yeah. Though it's kinda hard to miss you like this. Well, just... trying to make an entrance. I see that. Ruby is around the corner, three doors down. My mom's with her right now. - Are you visiting, too? - Nope, this is my place. Hospital administrator. So are you trying to drum up some business? You found me out. Well, I hope visiting hours aren't over. Visiting hours are never over. Never? Nope. This is North Carolina, Joy, not D.C. How am I supposed to do the Cookie Crawl like this? Ben will take over. It's a two-person job. Honey, you just concentrate on what's important. You're right. I just made a cake. Would you be a friend and go home and get it for me? And here I was worried about you. Joy! Did you call her? Aren't you glad I did? I sure am. Did you drive all the way through? I stopped to get your favorite magazines, so that you won't go stir crazy and try and take over the place. How's the patient? Impatient. Sounds about right. It's just a silly ankle. She is seeing her doctor tomorrow for the official word. You're worrying Joy. We're all worried about you, Ruby. Is that Rocky Road? The rockiest. Joy, do you remember my son... Ben. We sort of ran into each other down in the lobby, Mom. It's been a while. I think the last time I saw you, you were headed off to college? Georgetown. And you went to... - Columbia. - Right. You became a New Yorker. Yeah, for a little while. You know what, I think we should get out of Ruby's hair for a bit. What about my animals? They need feeding. I can take care of them. I was actually planning on staying at the farm tonight. Thank you, honey. The Cookie Crawl! Ben! What are we going to do? - It's in seven days! - No, don't... Is that the thing where people buy tickets to go look at decorations and eat cookies? - Christmas cookies. - Yes. But there are so many strong competitors this year! And your aunt has won the past four years. Thanks to Ben. Ben? Ruby's co-captain at your service. Aunt Ruby, why didn't you ever ask me to be your co-captain? I'm your niece. Honey, you're never here anymore. I might have come home. - From D.C.? - Yeah. - To help with a cookie crawl? - Is that so crazy? No. You know, you guys, we can discuss this later. I think we should let Ruby get some rest. Okay. I'll come back tomorrow, so we can hear what the doctor has to say. Thank you, Joy. Of course. It sure is good seeing you here again. It's good to see you, too. Rest up. Oh, man. Normally I'd say hindsight is 20/20, but not in this case. You're hilarious. I thought these things came with cool cameras and cappuccino makers or something? Maybe if I'd had a cappuccino I would have been able to use the cool camera. Do you have a pen and paper? I gotta leave the truck's owner my info. The truck's owner knows. Of course. I'm so sorry. You know... you wanna hear the good news? My truck's fine. - But your Mini looks disappointed. - Disappointed! That you didn't use the cool camera to avoid something like this! Well... But you wanna hear more good news? Can't wait. I know a guy who can fix that for the cost of parts and a pizza. - Seriously? - Seriously. My cousin, Zeke. Take it to his place, any day but Saturday. - Zeke? - Yeah. Why not Saturday? He helps out at his parents' diner on Saturday. Right. Yeah. Did you forget how small this town can be? Apparently. Should be good to drive for now, but, hey, let me know if the bumper falls off. Thank you. You're welcome. Anytime. Yeah, I got it. Thanks for carrying those in, sweetie. Of course. If it's okay with you, I think I'm going to swing by later this week to pick up the decorations for the Crawl. I'm kind of tired. Are you still planning to do that? Alone? Sure. I'll have to start even earlier now that Ruby's out of commission. It's just a lot of work for one person. Hi, honey. Hey... Dad, what's wrong? I just finished watching "It's A Wonderful Life". It gets me every time. You are such a softy. That's why you love me. Do you remember Ruby's niece, Joy? She came to see her today in the hospital. Drove all the way from Washington D.C. - Well, that was nice of her. - I know. I can't believe she said she'd come back to help with the Crawl. A nice gesture from another big city girl. Oh, come on, Ben. Not all city women are... you-know-who. Ben? All this talk about the Cookie Crawl, and there's still so much to prepare for... our contest, the gingerbread contest, and we're... we're still teammates, right? As long as Ashley doesn't go into labor. You know, you've been judging the gingerbread contest for four years now, which makes four years that we couldn't be teammates. I promise, if Ashley can't be a judge, I'll find someone else who can. I love you. I love you, too. There you go. Not exactly how I pictured my weekend. You again. That's a new look. It was either this, or an emerald cocktail dress. Good call. Mondays are the formal days around here. - I'll be sad to miss it. - Yeah. Where's the "to-go" line? Grab a seat, somebody'll find you. You in a hurry? Ruby's meeting with her doctor today. You've got plenty of time. I'll tell them not to start without you. Are you going, too? Mom couldn't make it, so she wanted me to make sure Ruby listens to the doctor's orders. What are the chances of that? See you there. Yup. No! Aunt Ruby... It's six days! I can't put any weight on it now? Exactly. Which is why you'll need to keep your ankle elevated for the most part. I can do all of that at home. And then you'd just be tempted to get into the decorations, which is too risky. This way is safer. So, how far away is the rehab center? - About two hours south. - It's too far! - Your insurance covers it. - That's not the point. I won't be able to do the Christmas Cookie Crawl. It's important to me. You'll be home in time to participate. - But not prepare. - I'll prepare. That way, when you get home, you won't miss a thing. Honey, it is so much work. Don't worry about it. Besides, you took me in at the worst time in my life, and made me feel safe and loved. It's the least I can do. - But what about your job? - Let me worry about that. I've got some vacation days, and I've got my laptop, so I can work remotely. Listen, you just focus on healing, and I'll take care of everything, including the Crawl, okay? Joy! I'm so glad I found you, I tried to catch you at the hospital. - Here's my card. - Why? So you can call me, set up a time to meet, go over the specifics of the Crawl. Why would we need to meet? We have a lot of ground to cover in six days. We've got to figure out a theme. Ruby keeps a record of all the themes that've been used, which is helpful. Last year's was "International Christmas". Once we figure out a theme, we have to create the interior and exterior design, integrate the Christmas trees... - "Trees", plural? - Yes, plural. - I'm thinking four, maybe five? - Five trees? Yeah, you'll see. And we've got to start making the dough reserves. - Dough reserves? - Yeah. We're going to be making a lot of cookies, but first, we have to make a lot of dough. Okay, Ben, I appreciate the fact that you've helped my aunt over the last few years, however, I just need an overview, not a co-captain. This is a two-person job... Which describes most of the jobs I already do, except I do them alone. You don't know what you're getting into. It's Christmas trees and cookies, not advanced calculus, which, by the way, I aced. Then you'll understand these numbers... 20 dozen sugars, 14 dozen thumbprints, 10 dozen shortbread, four dozen lemon bars, 40 dozen chocolate chip, regular and chocolate-chocolate. 30 dozen brownies, with and without nuts. - Both? - Both. All that's just what we did last year. 15's another number. That's how many houses are participating this year, each trying to win the golden wreath. - The... - Golden wreath? - That's a thing? - A big thing. Your aunt's thing. The thing you just promised to take care of, alone. Good luck, Solo, and welcome back. Seven days? Well, five, and there's a weekend in there, so it's really not as many as it seems. I thought you went home because of your aunt. I did, and that led me to the Cookie Crawl. Cookie? It's this thing, it's important to her, so it's important to me... No, no, no, I get it, family is first. Thank you. Okay, and I brought my laptop and cell phone with me, so I can work remotely. I saw the Weatherton's report went out. It was perfect. Great. The good news is we're headed into the December pre-holiday slowdown, but you will be back in time for The Christmas Gala, yes? Absolutely. I already have my dress. Okay, good. Happy baking. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Joy said she wanted to do the whole thing by herself. What? And you agreed? I can't make her work with me. Besides, this way, I'll have more time to focus on the gingerbread contest with you. Yeah, but does she truly have any idea what she's getting herself into? She will when I bring over the decorations I still have from last year. "Find a theme. "Make dough. "Decorate the house. Make the cookies". Not so bad. This is bonkers. Hi. Yet another new look for you. Yeah, well, I figured if I'm gonna be here for a few days, I should do some shopping. What brings you here? - I brought decorations for the Crawl. - Actually, I already found them. You found half of 'em. I have the other half. Is all this really necessary? You can probably do without a few boxes. Depends on how many trees you use. Once you figure out more of your theme, you know, you'll... You have figured out your theme, right? I figured I'd start baking first, and get inspired. I gather you disapprove. It's your show. But from my experience, I'd figure out a theme as soon as possible. Okay, why not go with the most direct? Christmas Cookies. More disapproval? At least try. It's not just about the cookies. It's about the whole Christmas experience. Okay, what theme would you choose? I thought you didn't want my help. I'm just asking for a casual suggestion. Based on my years of Cookie Crawl experience. - All right, I'll pay you. - Pay me? I mean, what's the going rate for Cookie Crawl consultation? Joy, here in small towns, we help each other because it's the right thing to do, not because somebody's paying us. If you do want my help, you know where to find me. I got this. Okay, Margie, I'm all yours. Back again. Yes, I need coffee in the mornings. Smart. The coffee here's good. Ben, I'm sorry. I want to apologize for offering to pay. I didn't mean to offend you. Thank you. I probably overreacted a bit. Why? I guess I... it just reminded me of something my ex-wife might have done, still hits a nerve I guess. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it at all. I was thinking about the Cookie Crawl, and I think... Excuse me. Yeah. Of course. Hello? Hey! Oh, you did? That's amazing. He's a big boy. Bye-bye. Thanks. Everything okay? Yeah, actually, it's great news. - My assistant had her baby. - Good for her! Yeah, a week early. Everyone's... everyone's healthy, and that's what's important. I'm sensing there's more to the story. Selfishly. Ashley was running the local gingerbread contest. Wait, full stop. Crystal Falls has a Christmas Cookie Crawl and a gingerbread contest? Do the grand prizes come with a lifetime gym membership? No, but that's... that's a good idea. All right, so why is the happy arrival of a baby problematic for you? Because Ashley took over the gingerbread contest from me so I could enter with my mom. That's so cute. Yeah, well, unfortunately, it's not gonna happen now. I can't judge and participate. - Why do you have to judge? - Because there's no one else. At this point, everyone's either entered or doing something else on the 22nd, so I'm gonna have to break my promise to my mom, unless I can find s... What? - You'll be in town then. - Me? Oh, no, Captain Christmas, this time, you've gone too far. Come on, please, I'm begging. No, no, no, no, I am up to here in cookie prep. Not to mention my real job, for which I'm up for a promotion, and can't let anything slide. And my company's formal Christmas gala is that night. - I'll help with the Cookie Crawl. - We've already went over this. I know you said you like to do things solo, but that was before you saw what a huge undertaking it was. Come on, you already look tired. Thanks! A pretty kind of tired. You gotta admit, it's more than you imagined it'd be, right? Judging the gingerbread contest is barely anything! Ashley already did 99.9% of the work. All right, don't try and dazzle me with data. We can help each other. I'll pitch in for the Cookie Crawl, I'll do all the heavy lifting. Seriously, I will lift heavy objects, and whatever else you need. What do you say? Me and you? Cookies and gingerbread? Fine. Cookies and gingerbread. "Captain Christmas"? That's you. Recipes... Recipes... My mom gave me a Christmas ornament once that was exactly this color. No, I really think that we should leave the candy focus group in December, because by January, people will be all sugared out. And I can say that with great confidence. What is going on? Are you making cookies for an army? I mean, you cannot imagine how much preparation this takes. Hold on while I switch this conversation to record. Is this the contest you're judging? Nope, that's the gingerbread contest. All of this is for the Cookie Crawl. It is a whole new world you have entered. Yes. Which is why I need you to tell me workish things, I need the contrast. Well, it's just a rumor. Oh, go on. Something's going on with the Weatherton's account. Like what? That's just it, nobody knows. But someone overheard Margie's assistant talking about bringing up all of the Weatherton's files. That must go back a decade at least. Well, it could be nothing. Or it could be something. I know I'm not lead on their account, but they really are my favorite client. Come in! Is that the gingerbread guy? Hey. Hi! Say hi to Renee. Hi. Ben, Renee. Renee, Ben. That's Ben? Nice to kinda meet you, Renee. You, too, Ben. All right, we're off to make our cookie dough. Even though we don't have a theme yet. It's possible that we could be inspired by making our "dough reserves". Though that hasn't been my experience. All right, I gotta go, bye. Bye. What's wrong? Nothing. Just looks like you're making the oatmeal raisin first. I am, because they're my favorite. I usually like to start with the chocolate chip. It tends to last longer. Okay, well, just because that's how you've always done things, doesn't mean that's how they should always be done. Tell that to four Golden Wreaths. All right, maybe you should just open up to some new possibilities. The possibility of losing. I'm gonna do my batch, you do your thing. Great. I think I will. - Not bad for our first round. - "First round," he says so easily. It's a little tricky. There we go. - Impressive. - Thank you. I get a bizarre satisfaction from crossing things off my "to-do" lists. That's half the fun of my job. You know, you don't really strike me as an admin guy. - It's the flannel. - You're right. So, I was looking through some of Aunt Ruby's notebooks, and you're right, there is a big emphasis on theme. Did you just say I was right? Anyway... I started brainstorming some theme ideas. You wanna hear? Go for it. Okay, studies show that people are drawn to things that are twists on the familiar, so I was thinking, "Frosty the Snowman goes tropical". I see melting. Okay, maybe not the best twist. What about Dickens? I'm a sucker for "A Christmas Carol". It was done in 2012. Mabel Pine. She came in third. Before my time. What about Dickens 2.0? A virtual-reality Scrooge goes back and forth in time? Come on, we're "twisting". I like the classics to stay pretty much classic. - Yes, and dated. - Not dated. Proven. Proven to be dated. Look... look at this. Look at this ornament. It's gorgeous. Simple, classic. It doesn't need a twist. Why mess with something proven to be... Joy, I am... I am so, so sorry. It's okay, I'll get a broom. It was just... it was from my mom. Here, I'll clean it up. Thanks. Who's Phil Finnegan? He's the regional sales rep for Carolina's Best Flour. They're the sponsors for the gingerbread contest. He wants to meet for coffee in an hour. He probably just wants to go over the rules, the contest, - get you up to speed. - Okay. How about this... I'll follow you to Zeke's, so you can drop off your car before you meet with Phil, then I'll drive you home. Okay. - But you're buying Zeke's pizza. - Done. Ready? Pizza for repairs, all right? Thanks, Ben. - Yup, as promised. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I appreciate it. - Deluxe, right? - Just what you ordered. All right... Hi, Phil. There you are. I was getting nervous. We're three minutes early. But it's only three days until the contest, and I want to make sure that she knows everything. There's so much for you to learn. Phil Finnegan, Joy Holbrook. Hi. How much exactly? These are our rules and regulations. Now, it would be really helpful if you could get up to speed on these as quickly as possible. Being a judge is a lot of responsibility. I don't suppose there's a shorter version. This is the shorter version. Great. Three days, huh? - You are so buying me dinner. - Yes. Yes, I am. Crystal Falls Lodge. I can't remember the last time I was here. Let me guess, prom? No, actually. I didn't go to prom. - That's surprising. - Not really. I mean, I moved here when I was 15. You know, at that point, everybody already had their best friends since elementary school. And that was right after my mom... So, I wasn't exactly in the best place. - That I remember. - I'm sure you do. Your mom made you take me to the movies when you were home from college on your Christmas break. Asked. Still. It couldn't have been fun. You were quiet, but I knew why. And if I remember correctly, the movie was good. - "Love, Actually" is the best. - Is that which one it was? I think so. I'd forgotten about that. When was the last time you were home? Gosh, I don't know. Probably not since I graduated from college. I mean, I started working right away, all the time. And Aunt Ruby comes to visit me in D.C., so... I didn't realize how long it had been until... Well, I know Ruby would love to have you around more. Plus, this is a nice town. It is. - Some might even call it "classic". - Whoa, don't push it. - I'm hungry. - Yeah, me too. - Ben! - Mom, Dad, hi! Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews. Joy, it's so good to see you again. You too. Joy, could you excuse us for a second? Of course. So, what... Are you two on a date? No. No, we were working on the contest together, and, you know, got hungry. At the same time. - Couldn't just order a pizza? - It's not like that. I see. Mom... She's leaving in a few days, and you know I don't date people who live in the city anymore. - I thought you were over Anne. - I am over Anne, but it doesn't mean I can't learn from the lesson. Which is? "Stay in your lane". Well, just remember, my son, if you never leave your lane, the scenery's gonna get mighty boring. Hey, Margie. Am I calling too late? No, it's fine. What's up? Good. I want you to write up the report on the Hansen Candy focus group. I thought Renee was handling that? Yes, but her boyfriend is surprising her with a birthday weekend, and I told her that you would take over since you're not busy. Well, I am busy... Surely, you can make time between making cookies. Yeah, of course. Just send me the transcripts. Already have, with my notes, and I'll need it by noon tomorrow. Really appreciate it. Bye! Bye. So, where are you with the dough count? I've got about a quarter of the sugar cookie dough done and some brownies, too. "Some" brownies? I know for a fact that Fern Hartley's freezer is 3/4 full. And you know Twyla Taft's at capacity. Oh, yeah. Okay, I will focus on our dough count. And if you want my advice, I would double the Oreo snowmen. Ruby here tends to run out. I do not. Well, you were down to one last year. - That's not running out. - Well, you got lucky. So... have you started decorating yet? No, we thought we'd do that after we figure out our theme. You haven't picked a theme? Oh, dear. It's in three days, and you don't have a theme? Ben and I are kicking around some ideas. And? It's definitely not "Tropical Frosty". How you doing, honey? You seem a little wiped. I had an emergency work project come in late last night. - What, due ASAP? - Is there any other way? - Thank you. - Thank you. Well, I'm glad those days are behind me. Yeah... I used to be a paralegal, back in the day. Everything was urgent, and I just was on the go constantly, yet, you know, never getting anywhere. So, what did you do? I walked away, and started working at the hospital, and I've never looked back. I don't know that I can just walk away. I've put so much of myself into my job. Does it make you happy, honey? Parts of it do. Other parts, not so much. Well, maybe it's just about figuring out which parts are most important to you. - Thank you. - Thank you. So, I was looking through Ashley's notes, and it doesn't look like you guys use blind voting for the gingerbread contest. That's right. Well, I mean, that can lead people to load up on one entry, or to give pity votes to another. Do you have another idea? I do. I'm gonna have to email you, though, okay? Okay. Okay, bye. - Aren't you cold? - No. I have hot chocolate, with a special ingredient. What's wrong with regular hot chocolate? Come on, you can handle it. - It's cayenne. - Pepper? Makes it double warm. Did you get that trick from one of Ruby's notebooks? No, actually, my mom used to do that when I was little. It's delicious. See? New things. So, I bet you're wondering why I called this meeting. - It's either cookies or gingerbread. - It's the Cookie Crawl. We need to get started on finding our theme so that we can start decorating. I'm still not doing virtual-reality Scrooge. No, I know. Have you ever heard the phrase "creativity happens in the cracks"? Can't say I have. Okay, so it basically means you knock your head against an idea for however long it takes, but staring at a computer or a blank piece of paper, you get nowhere, but you go take a shower, wash your dishes, suddenly, voila! - The answer appears. - Exactly. So... today, we're going to find the crack. How'd you find this place? My Aunt Ruby used to bring me here. - To the Wildfire Inn? - To what's inside it. I totally forgot this place was here. Oh, you, Captain Christmas, forgot about an ice-skating rink? I know, right? A new rink was built closer to town about 10 years ago. I like this one. Let's give it a go. Okay. Need help? - Yeah! - You're good? You think? So, I know it's a billion years later, but I wanted to thank you for taking me to the movies way back when. Of course. Okay, so that's ancient history. - What's your story now? - My story? It's sad, mainly because it's so boring and dateless. - Really? Nobody? - I mean... Come on. There was a guy, Todd, this summer, but we just went on a few dates. Todd... - How'd that end? - In a fizzle. It's always a fizzle. Always a fizzle, I get that. Any idea for the theme yet? - Nope. - Me neither. Maybe we're trying too hard to not try too hard. Maybe. Let's listen to the trees for a second. Close your eyes. I have a confession to make. I come out into the forest whenever I'm upset about something and listen to the trees. It puts things in perspective. So you're saying you're a tree whisperer? I am. - Do they whisper back? - All the time. And what do they say? It's not so much about what they say, it's about how they make me feel connected to everything. One of my favorite quotes, it's something like, "Once we pick out one thing, "we wind up realizing "that everything's hitched to everything else in the Universe". John Muir. I always liked that one. It reminds me of Crystal Falls. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, everything here is connected. I mean, just being home has made me realize that no matter how far away I go, or how long I've been gone, that I am still hitched to Crystal Falls. - So why don't you come back more? - I don't know, I was only here for a couple of years right after my mom passed, and then when I went away to school, I think maybe it was easier to pretend like I wasn't from anywhere, or connected to anything. But then your mom called, and I realized, I am connected, to my Aunt Ruby, to my good memories here, and... Wait. Wait, that's it. - What? - Our theme! Mother Nature, about how we're all connected through nature, and it becomes especially apparent at Christmas, when people come together. I think it's perfect. So let's go make it happen. It's beautiful. And you didn't snag anyone in the process. That's half the fun. Is that something you make a habit of doing? You were the first. Okay, so I think the tables go here, here, and there. Ruby always puts them against that wall over there. Yeah, but this way would have better flow. Better flow? Yeah, so people can access both sides of the table. - You are breaking out in hives. - I'm fine. No, you're not. You're out of your comfort zone, and it's bugging you. Is it so wrong for me to want my comfort zones to be comfortable? And safe, and proven. I feel like we're veering away from table arrangement talk. All right, that's fine. We can go back to the comfort zone. Thank you. Although, for the record, I can do change. I lived in New York until a couple years ago. - So, what brought you back? - My mom and dad retired. They always seemed so invincible, and then suddenly, they were taking a step back, and I... that made me realize how much I was missing out on. Seeing them at Christmas just wasn't enough for me anymore. So, I got a job at the hospital and moved home. - Are you glad you did? - No question. I've had more fun today than I've had in longer than I can remember. Well... I'm glad to be a part of it. Thank you. What's wrong? I have to go. I have to go... help my mom with the, gingerbread contest stuff. Okay. Thank you for the ice skating, and the tree decorating, and... and everything. I think we're in good shape for the Cookie Crawl. I need some cookies. No... No... The whole top of the freezer was defrosted, and the dough went bad. The bottom half stayed cold enough. That's good news. Yeah, except I had to go two towns over to replace all the supplies. Two towns? Between the gingerbread contest and the Cookie Crawl, it's like baking locusts have descended on this town. You're not seriously thinking about trying to make more dough, are you? I have to. The Crawl's in two days. With the Gala tomorrow night. And the gingerbread competition I'm judging is tomorrow afternoon. Good luck, Wonder Woman. I know. I'm id something's gotta give, and I'm afraid it might be me. You're still coming to the Gala, though, right? Yes, of course! Okay, just checking. You've been in the Land of Perpetual Sugar so long. I know how important it is. Good, because Margie isn't too thrilled you've been gone. What do you mean, did she say something? Nothing direct. Just little comments, and she made a big deal about me giving you the Hansen Candy report to do. Well, I thought you were out of town. I was, and I could've handled it. But she kept saying you were basically on vacation, and that you should pick up the slack. Well, that's not good. I mean, she's basically the biggest factor in me making Director. Right? So don't skip. Get Handsome Ben to help you. I don't know about that. Why? I thought you guys were co-captains. - Well... - Wait. Did something happen between you two? Something almost happened between us, and then he pulled away, so it didn't, and then it got weird. I think it's best if I do things without Ben from now on. Ben, you're awfully quiet today. What's on your mind? Nothing. Just thinking about... work, and the contest tomorrow, and the Crawl. How's all that going? Fine. Great. Amazing. That is such good news. And Dr. Walsh said I was doing so well, I could already use a cane. That's wonderful. What was that? I just had to do some last-minute shopping, get some extra dough ingredients. How many extra? Just... a little bit. Joy... I can hear it in your tone that something's wrong, so you might as well tell me everything now, save us both the time. Boy, do I need time. Almost done. Just got to let this section dry for a couple hours, and then it'll be ready for the icing. Ruby just called. Why didn't you tell me Joy had a problem with the cookie dough freezer, hmm? - What, she didn't tell you? - No. I thought you guys were spending all this time together. I helped her get ready for the Cookie Crawl. - How bad is it? - Half of it's gone, and apparently, she's going to stay up all night tonight. She can't possibly handle all that by herself. No. She can't. - Word travels fast. - And we're here to help, sweetie. Come on in. Hi. Thank you for coming. Thank you guys so much for all your hard work. I know you did it for Aunt Ruby, but... - We did it for you and Ruby. - I really appreciate it. I know. Well... - All right. - Get some rest. Yeah. - Bye, Shirley. - Bye, sweetie. Bye. Hey, Ben... - Thank you. - Of course. - Look, about yesterday... - It's okay. We got caught up in a moment, it happens. But I made it awkward... Life gets awkward sometimes. It's fine. Like now? See you tomorrow? - Cookies and gingerbread. - Cookies and gingerbread. Thanks. - Are those... - The voting boxes without voter bias. You can't see through them. I like it. Gosh! It looks wonderful. Tell Joy thank you. Will do. Each person gets one coin to vote with. Here you go. Grab one... Cast your vote. Wisely? - Joy? - Excuse me. Check, check... Hi, everyone. I'm Phil Finnegan, and I am thrilled to officially welcome you all to Carolina's Best Flour's Gingerbread Bake-Off! This year, the honor of announcing the winners goes to our newest judge, Joy Holbrook! Thanks, Phil. Thank you guys so much for having me. You have all done a wonderful job here. So, as you can see, we went with a blind voting system, so I think the results will be a little bit more of a surprise than you're used to. But let's get down to business. Based on our secret ballots, we've tallied all your votes, and I have the top three winners here. Third prize goes to the Carolina Panthers' stadium at Christmas. - Congratulations. - Well done. Second prize goes to... the Christmas Carousel! Well done. And the winner of Carolina's Best Flour's Gingerbread Bake-Off is... Santa's Workshop among the trees! Brought to you by the mother-son duo of Ben and Shirley Andrews. Victory photo! First-place winners, bravo! Got it. And now for the words that everybody's been waiting for... time to eat! - Congrats. - Thank you. - Look! Look at that. - Well done! Congratulations. Thanks, Dad. Are you heading back to D.C.? My company's Christmas Gala is tonight. It's just five hours away. After the gingerbread contest, and staying up all night making cookie dough? I've been drinking lots of coffee. Well, I just wanted to come out and tell you you did a great job with the judging. The blind voting idea was a good one. Thank you. But Ashley really did 99% of the work. Now who's dazzling with the data? That's what I do. I know you gotta get out of here, this is just one thing. - What's this? - It's just a Christmas present. Open it later. You gotta get going, I know. I'm coming back for the Cookie Crawl tomorrow. You could just give it to me then. Just in case you decided to change your mind and stay in D.C. Thank you. Well, drive safe. Ben! Hey, Dad. I saw you heading out this way. Whatcha doing? Thinkin'. About anything in particular? Joy. I'm guessing you mean the young lady, not the emotion. Unless one brings the other. I feel like I'm setting myself up for heartbreak. Well, that very well could be. I gotta say, you're not looking real happy at this moment, either. But Joy lives in D.C. What if I'm getting myself right back in the same kind of situation? Well, that's the risk. Anytime you put yourself out there, there's always a risk. I know, Dad. I know she's not Anne. Well then, if you like her and you want her to know it, you gotta find her and tell her, and... then wait and see if she'll stick around for the long haul. Like everybody else. There are no shortcuts, Ben. Come on... Oh, Ben... Hey. Hey, I'm downstairs in the car. Okay, I'll be right down. Sorry, traffic was crazy. I'll just, I have to finish my hair in the car. See you soon. Joy, Renee, it's good to see you. You too. Does this mean you're back in D.C. for good now? I have to run back tomorrow. My aunt's getting released from the hospital, and it's the Cookie Crawl. Isn't that what you've been doing the entire time? I've been preparing for the Crawl. How lovely. Sure. That's great. Excuse me. Mrs. Weatherton, how are you? Hey, did you ever hear what was going on with the Weatherton's account? No, but Fran in Margie's office said they weren't even sure Poppy was gonna show up tonight. - That's not good. - Well, at least she's here. And you, too! It's nice to see your pretty face on something other than a monitor. You too. Now let's go to the bar, and you can tell me all about what's going on with Ben. Thank you. - I knew that dress was perfect. - Mrs. Weatherton... I called your office last week. They said you were out of town, in North Carolina? Yes, ma'am. - Crystal Falls? - I know that place. - You do? - Yes, I have family in Charlotte. What brought you there? I was helping my aunt with the town Cookie Crawl. The... I'm sorry, did you say you called the office for me? Yes. If your office is anything like ours, I'm sure you've heard some gossip lately. I came here in part tonight to let you know that there are going to be some changes starting in January, and I want you to know that I valued your input in our account over the years, even when you didn't get the... obvious credit. Thank you, so much. That means a lot to me. - Cookie Crawl? - Cookie Crawl. My imagination is... running wild. Okay, let's go. Of course, Mrs. Weatherton. This way. - Have you ever head of a Cookie Crawl? - I have not. Look it up for me, would you? Joy! What did Poppy Weatherton say? She just wanted to thank me for working on her account. What's going on? Okay, you can't say anything yet, but we lost Weatherton's. - What? - I just found out for certain... which means that I'm going to need to you to work double-time starting tomorrow. I can't tomorrow. My aunt comes home, and then we have the Cookie Crawl. Joy, we just lost one of our biggest clients. We can't waste any time finding a way to replace that revenue. - I promised my aunt. - She'll understand. I won't. Joy, just... I want you to think about things. Now, they haven't announced the promotions yet. - What are you saying? - Just be smart about this. This is your career. Now, you could very well be busier than you have ever been. I already pour so much of my time into this job, that I barely see my friends or my aunt as it is... - Joy... - I'm sorry, Margie. If it's a couple of days that you need, I... No. Thank you, though. You know, I've been dreaming of this Christmas Gala for so long, and now that I'm here, I just... I feel so disconnected. - All I wanna be is... - In Crystal Falls? It's my home. I will let the partners know. Thank you. For so many things. Joy... - Hi! - Hi! - I think I just quit my job. - You did not. Cheers. - Cheers! - What? - Oh, my gosh... - I'm a free woman. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. Hey, we need more champagne from the back. - Excuse me? - Champagne. From the back. Come on. Can you excuse me for just a second? Yeah. Excuse me. Hi. You've reached Ben Andrews. Please leave a message. Can you grab my car, please? I'm doing it. Yup... Thanks to the helping hands of friends and family, we have five tables set up for the Cookie Crawl. - So... when can I see? - Soon. We've still got a bit of work to do, but we'll get it done. Yes, we will. So, when are the Andrews clan coming over tonight? I'm not sure. I haven't heard back from Ben yet. What's going on? I don't know. We worked together great on the gingerbread competition, and then he pulled back, and then he showed up at the MacDonald Webber Gala. - In D.C.? - Yes! But he left before I could talk to him, and it's just been radio silence ever since. - That doesn't seem like Ben. - I know. So, I don't know what to do about the Cookie Crawl. That'll take care of itself. The important thing is how you're doing. - I don't like feeling like this. - Vulnerable? Yeah. Love makes us vulnerable. And I am pleased as punch that you're feeling that way about someone. - Ben is a good one. - Then why won't he call me back? That's up to you to figure out before you leave. About that. How would you feel about having a roommate for a little while? - Are you considering... - Making some changes in my life, and making time for the people I love. I think that would be the greatest Christmas gift that you could give me. Hello! I bought a new one so I thought I'd bring back your old snow shovel... - Why aren't you calling Joy back? - And good morning, Mom. Ruby's home, and she said that Joy has been trying to get ahold of you, and you are not responding. - Mom, let me handle it. - Except you're not handling it. I'll make it a point to say goodbye before she goes back to D.C. Well, that shows how little you know. She's staying. What? Yeah. In Crystal Falls. It seems she turned down some big promotion, and decided to move back home for a bit. Why? You'll have to ask her that yourself. Careful. - Just a couple more steps. - Okay. Ta-dah! It's like Mother Nature came and decorated it herself. That's what I was going for. We're serving two kinds of hot chocolate. - Regular and... - And one with kick, like Emma used to make for you. Joy, it is just perfect. - Perfect. - Good. I'm glad you're happy. I love it. By the way, I found out what Twyla Taft's theme is. "Chocolate Chip". That's it? It's like she wasn't even trying. I almost feel bad how good ours is. Almost. Here we go! Come on. Make yourselves at home. Come on in. Welcome! Good to see you. Excuse me. You made it! There was no way I was going to miss this. - Where is he? - Who? Ben! I'm not sure he's going to make it. I haven't seen him yet. - Well, the night's not over yet. - Okay. Hi, everyone! It's so great to see you all. I just wanted to take this moment to say... thank you to Joy, for all her hard work so we could all celebrate this night. Thank you. As you were. Ben made this for me. That reminds me of the one that Emma gave you. - I love it. - I do, too. Excuse me. So, this is a Cookie Crawl. Mrs. Weatherton, what... what are you doing here? I was over in Charlotte, and I got curious. It really is extraordinary. A lot of people worked very hard to make this happen. - But you took point, didn't you? - I did. I thought as much. You probably know by now I've taken Weatherton's market research out from MacDonald-Webber. Margie mentioned it to me. What she likely didn't mention is that I've decided to create an in-house marketing division, and I would love for you to be part of the leadership team. - Me? - Yes. If you're interested. Of course, that would likely entail a move on your part since I'm opening a new store and new corporate offices in Charlotte. But something tells me you won't mind. I do hope you'll call me on January 2nd to discuss. Thank you. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm dying for a ginger snap. Enjoy. Oh, my. You're here. I wasn't sure if... I am co-captain. It's as much your doing as anyone else's. You brought everything together so nicely. I'm sorry I wasn't here for the last part. But you were in D.C., right? So why did you leave without talking to me? You looked so beautiful in that dress. And the way you fit in with that world, I never could do that. And I got scared. But I'd like to try again, if you'll let me. Maybe this time without the tux. I liked the tux, it was a nice touch. - I liked that dress. - You did? You looked beautiful. So, Joy Holbrook, will you go to dinner with me? Crystal Falls Lodge? It's not just for proms and Sweet 16 parties. - I think that can be arranged. - Can it? Turns out, I have a lot of arranging to do. I'm going to be starting a new job with Weatherton's office, in Charlotte. That's commuting distance. Which is a good thing, since I plan to be in Crystal Falls for a very long time. Are you sure? Took me a little while to realize it, but... "When you pick out anything by itself... " "... you find it hitched to everything else". And I'm hitched here. Rip-Fixes-Sync VaVooM
