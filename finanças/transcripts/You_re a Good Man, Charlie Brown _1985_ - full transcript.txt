I really don't think you have anything to worry about, Charlie Brown. After all, science has shown that a person's character... ...isn't really established until at he's at least 5 years old. But I am 5. I'm more than 5. Did you know that Charlie Brown has never pitched a winning baseball game? Never been able to keep a kite in the air? Never won a game of checkers... ...and never successfully punted a football? Sometimes I marvel at his consistency. I think Charlie Brown has nice hands. SNOOPY: It is truly a dog's life. The least Charlie Brown could do is start my day with a little tea and toast. Now, Linus, I want you to take a good look at Charlie Brown's face. Would you please hold still a minute, Charlie Brown? I want Linus to study your face. Now, this is what you call a failure face, Linus. Notice how it has failure written all over it. Study it carefully, Linus. You rarely see such a good example. Notice the deep lines, the dull, vacant look in the eyes. Yes, I would say this is one of the finest examples of a failure face... ...that you're liable to see for a long while. [RINGS] CHARLIE: Some days I like to wake up early... ...so that I can see the sunrise. And I think how beautiful it is... ...and how my life lies before me. And I get a very positive feeling about things. Like this morning, for instance. The sky is so clear and the sun’s so bright. How could anything go wrong on a day like this? [KIDS SCATTING MARCHING-BAND MUSIC] SNOOPY: Woof! KIDS: Boom! ALL [SINGING]: You're a good man, Charlie Brown You're the kind of reminder we need You have humility, nobility And a sense of honor That are very rare indeed SNOOPY: Woof! KIDS: Boom! ALL [SINGING]: You're a good man, Charlie Brown And we know you will go very far Yes, it's hard to believe Almost frightening to conceive What a good man you are You are kind. ALL [SINGING]: You are kind to all the animals And every little bird With a heart of gold You believe what you're told Every single, solitary word ALL: You bravely face adversity You're cheerful through the day You're thoughtful, brave and courteous And you also have some faults But for the moment let’s just say ALL: That you're a good man, Charlie Brown [ALL SINGING] SNOOPY: Woof! KIDS: Boom! ALL [SINGING]: You're a good man, Charlie Brown You're a prince And a prince should be king With a heart such as yours You could open any doors You could go out and do anything You could be king, Charlie Brown You could be king If only you weren't so wishy-washy. [PLAYING BEETHOVEN'S "MOONLIGHT SONATA"] [SINGING] Do you know something, Schroeder? I think the way you play the piano Is nice Do you know something else? It’s always been my dream That I'd marry a man Who plays the piano At parties he'd play something nice Like "April Showers" I'm sure you could play something nice Like "April Showers" Or even "Frère Jacques" Beethoven's nice too Just imagine What would you think If someday you and I should get married? Wouldn't you like that If someday we two should get married? My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician. Beethoven loved the country. He quite often liked to take long strolls into the countryside. He loved the peace and the quiet of the country. They were an inspiration to him. LUCY: Give me that ball, you blockhead! Beethoven had it nice. CHARLIE [SINGING]: Little more speed, little more rope Little more wind, little more hope Gotta get this stupid kite to fly I gotta make sure it doesn’t snag Doesn’t droop, doesn’t drag Gotta watch out for every little-- Whoops! [SNOOPY YELPING] CHARLIE [SINGING]: Little less speed, little more tack Little less rise, little more slack Gotta keep my wits about me now I gotta make sure It doesn’t get the best of me Till I get it in the air somehow Millions of little kids do it every day They make a kite And, poof, it's in the sky Leave it to me To have the one fool kite Who likes to see a little kid cry Little less talk, little more skill Little less luck, little more will Gotta face this fellow eye to eye Now that I've seen you chasing moles Climbing trees, digging holes Catching your string On everything passing by [YELPING] CHARLIE [SINGING]: Why not fly? Wait a minute What's it doing? It isn't on the ground It isn't in a tree It's in the air Look at that It's caught the breeze now It’s past the trees now With room to spare Oh, what a beautiful sight And I'm not such a clumsy guy If I really try I can really fly a-- [WHISTLING FROM ABOVE] [THUD] [SALLY READING ON-SCREEN TEXT] This is for you, Lucy. Happy Valentine's Day. No, that's doesn’t sound right. Here, Lucy, this is for you. Happy Valentine's Day. CHARLIE: You can do it if you just don't get nervous. This is for you, Lucy. Happy Valentine's Day. CHARLIE: Okay, take it easy. You can do it. This is for you, Lucy. Merry Christmas. [CHARLIE GROANS] -Hi, Charles. -Hi, Marcie. Oh, wait a minute, you dropped something. Say, what is all this? Valentines. They're for all the boys in class at school I like. Well, we wouldn't wanna lose this one, would we? With the initials C.B. on it? No, I guess not. Craig Bowerman would be very disappointed. I can't stand it. CHARLIE: Look at them laughing and enjoying themselves with their valentines. I sent a valentine to everyone I know this Valentine's Day. And did I get any in return? No, not one. I did not get one single valentine. Everybody gets valentines but me. Nobody likes me. I get about as many valentines as a dog. [PLAYING J.S. BACH'S "PRELUDE NO. 11 IN F MAJOR"] What would you think, Schroeder, if someday you and I got married... ...and we were so poor... ...you had to sell the piano to buy me saucepans? Saucepans? Well, sure. You don't expect me to set up housekeeping... ...without a good set of saucepans, do you? Saucepans? Well, girls have to think about those things. Boys are lucky. Boys never have to think about things like saucepans. I can't stand it. I just can't stand it. [PLAYS DISCORDANT NOTES] Hey, Snoopy, we're home from school. Hi there, fella. Gosh, it's good to see you. Oh, Snoopy, you're so adorable. Okay, Snoopy, back on your doghouse. I'll be out later with your supper dish. I think Snoopy's such a wonderful dog. Me too. He's just about the best there is. [SNOOPY LAUGHING] SNOOPY [SINGING]: They like me I think they're swell Isn't it remarkable How things work out so well? [YAWNS] Pleasant day, pretty sky Life goes on, here I lie Not bad, not bad at all [SIGHS] Cozy home, board and bed Sturdy roof beneath my head Not bad, not bad at all [SIGHS] Faithful friends always near me Bring me bones, scratch my ear Little birds come to cheer me Every day, sitting here [BIRDS TWITTERING] SNOOPY [SINGING]: On my stomach With their sharp little claws Which are usually cold And occasionally painful And sometimes there are so many That I can hardly stand it! Rats. [SINGING] I feel every now and then That I gotta bite someone I know every now and then What I wanna be A fierce jungle animal Crouched on the limb of a tree [CHUCKLING] I'd stay very, very still Till I see a victim come I'd wait, knowing very well Every second counts And then like the fierce jungle creature I am I would pounce I'd pounce I'd pounce I'd-- [GASPS] You know, I never quite realized... ...it was such a long way down to the ground from here. [SIGHS] SNOOPY: Let me see. Where was I? Oh, that's right. [SINGING] The pretty sky Not bad, not bad at all [SIGHS] I wonder if it'll snow tonight. [YAWNS] Hi, Snoopy. How's the fella? Hi, Snoopy. Cute doggie. What do you say, tiger? Hi, fuzzy face. Hi, Snoopy. SNOOPY: Nobody ever calls me sugar lips. -Homework. -Homework. -Homework. LINUS: Homework. ALL: Yuck. [SINGING] A book report on Peter Rabbit [SINGING] A book report on Peter Rabbit [SINGING] A book report on Peter Rabbit CHARLIE [SINGING]: A book report on ALL: Peter Rabbit Peter Rabbit is a stupid book About the stupid rabbit Who steals vegetables From other people's gardens One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... ...10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Hmm. Eighty-three to go. [SINGING] The name of the book about which This book report is about is Peter Rabbit which is about this Rabbit I found it very-- I liked the part where-- It was a-- It reminded me of Robin Hood And the part where Little John jumped from the rock To the sheriff of Nottingham's back And then Robin and everyone swung From the trees in a sudden surprise attack And they captured the sheriff and all of his goods And he carried him back to the camp in the woods And the sheriff was guest at their dinner and all And he wiggled away and he sounded the call The men rushed in And the arrows flew Peter Rabbit did sort of that Kind of thing too [SINGING] The other people's name was McGregor Eighteen, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Hmm. In examining a work such as Peter Rabbit... ...it is important that the superficial characteristics... ...of its deceptively simple plot should not be allowed to blind the reader... ...to its more substantial fabric of its deeper motivations. In this report, I plan to discuss the sociological implications... ...of family pressures so great... ...as to drive an otherwise moral rabbit to perform acts of thievery... ...which he consciously knew were against the law. I also hope to explore the personality of Mr. McGregor... ...in his conflicting role as farmer and humanitarian. Peter Rabbit is established from the start as a benevolent hero... ...and it is only with the increase of social pressure... ...that the seams in his moral fabric-- [SINGING] If I start writing now When I'm not really rested It could upset my thinking Which is not good at all I'll get a fresh start tomorrow And it's not due till Wednesday So I'll have all of Tuesday Unless something should happen Why does this always happen? I should be outside playing Getting fresh air and sunshine I work best under pressure And there'll be lots of pressure If I wait till tomorrow I should start writing now But if I start writing now When I'm not really rested It could upset my thinking Which is not good at all [SINGING] The name of the rabbit was Peter Twenty-four, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Ha! [SINGING] Down came the staff on his head Smash! And Robin fell like a sack full of lead Crash! The sheriff laughed and he left him for dead Ha! But he was wrong Thirty-five, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. [SINGING] Just then an arrow flew in Whing! It was a sign for the fight to begin Zing! And then it looked like The sheriff would win, unh! But not for long Away they ran Just like rabbits, who run a lot As you can tell from the story Of Peter Rabbit Which this report Is about [SINGING] How do they expect us To write a book report CHARLIE: Of any quality in just two days? LUCY [SINGING]: There were vegetables in the garden Such as carrots and spinach and onions CHARLIE: How can they conspire LUCY: Lettuce, turnips, parsley CHARLIE: To make life so miserable? LUCY: Okra, cabbage, string beans, parsnips CHARLIE: And so effectively LUCY: Tomatoes, potatoes, asparagus, cauliflower CHARLIE: In so many ways? LUCY: Rhubarb, chives Not to mention the extreme pressure exerted on him... ...by his deeply rooted rivalry with Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail. SCHROEDER [SINGING]: The name of the book about which CHARLIE [SINGING]: If I start writing now when I'm not really rested SCHROEDER: This book report is about is CHARLIE: It could upset my thinking Which is not good at all LUCY: Peter Rabbit CHARLIE: Not good at all SCHROEDER: Robin Hood LUCY: Seventy-five, 76, 77, 78 CHARLIE: Oh, first thing after dinner I'll start SCHROEDER: All for one, every man does his part LUCY: Seventy-nine, 80, 81, 82 And they were very, very, very Very, very, very happy to be home -The end LUCY: Ninety-four, 95 The very, very, very end [SINGING] Amen A book report on Peter Rabbit -Hi, Linus. Where you going? -Lucy's teaching me, Charlie Brown. She says a sister is responsible for the education of her little brother. So she's teaching me. -Boy, is she intelligent. -Come along, Linus. [SINGING] Do you see this tree? It is a fir tree It's called a fir tree Because it gives us fur for coats It also gives us wool in the wintertime I never knew that before. That's very interesting. This is an elm tree. It's very little. [SINGING] But it will grow up into a giant tree An oak You can tell how old it is By counting its leaves LINUS: That's fascinating. -One, two, three-- Now wait a minute, Lucy. I don't mean to interfere-- [SINGING] And way up there Those fluffy little white things Those are clouds They make the wind blow And way down there Those tiny little black things Those are bugs They make the grass grow -Is that so? -That's right. They run around all day long... ...tugging and tugging at each tiny seedling... ...until it grows into a great, tall blade of grass. -Boy, that's amazing. -Oh, good grief. Linus? [SINGING] And this thing here It’s called a hydrant They grow all over And no one seems to know Just how a little thing like that Gets so much water Do you see that bird? It's called an eagle But since it's little, it has another name A sparrow On Christmas and Thanksgiving We eat them Lucy, how can you say that? I'm sorry, but I just can't stand idly by and listen to you-- [SINGING] And way up there The little stars and planets Make the rain that falls in showers And when it's cold and winter is upon us The snow comes up just like the flowers Now, Lucy, I know that's wrong. Snow doesn't come up, it comes down. After it comes up, the wind blows it around so it looks like it's coming down. Actually, it comes up out of the ground, like grass. It comes up, Charlie Brown, snow comes up. Oh, good grief. [BANGING] Lucy, why is Charlie Brown banging his head against the tree? To loosen the bark so the tree will grow faster. Come along, Linus. [SIGHS] [YAWNS] All right, gang. I want this game to be our biggest and best game of the season. And I want everybody out there playing with everything he or she's got. Charlie Brown, I thought up some new strategy for you. Why don't you tell the other team we're gonna play them at a certain place... ...only, it isn't the real place, see? And then when they don't show, we'll win by forfeit. Isn’t that good strategy? I don't understand these managers who don't wanna use good strategy. The thing we have to remember is spirit and teamwork. If we all really grit our teeth and bear down, I'm sure we can finish off this season with-- Charlie Brown, is Lucy going to pitch again? Because if she is, I quit. Do you know what she does? She's always calling me out for conferences on the mound. I go out there, see? I go out there for a secret conference on the mound. And you know what she does? She kisses me on the nose. If we really grit our teeth and bear down, I'm sure we can finish off this season with-- Perhaps you shouldn't be a playing manager, Charlie Brown. Perhaps you should be a bench manager. That's a good idea. You'd be a great bench manager, big brother. You could say, "Bench, do this," or "Bench, do that." You could even be in charge of where we put the bench. When we get to the playing field, you could say: "Let's put the bench over here," or "Let's put the bench over there." I can't stand it. What's the sense of our playing when we know we're going to lose? If there was even a million-to-1 chance we might win, it would make some sense. Well, there may not be a million-to-1 chance... ...but I'm sure there's at least a billion-to-1 chance. Now come on, give me a T. ALL: T! Give me an E. ALL: E! -Give me an A. ALL: A! -Give me an M. ALL: M! What have you got? ALL: Team! ALL [SINGING]: There is no team like the best team Which is our team right here We will show you we're the best team In the very little league this year And in no time we'll be bigtime With the big-league baseball stars For all we have to do is win Just one more game And the championship is ours [CHARLIE SINGING ON-SCREEN TEXT] CHARLIE [SINGING]: It’s hard to believe what happened to me At the baseball game I was the manager Schroeder was catcher And all of the team Was the same as always But somehow or other disaster struck At the baseball game ALL: There is no team like the best team Which is our team right here We will show you we're the best team In the very little league this year And in no time, we'll be bigtime With the big-league baseball stars For all we have to do is win Just one more game And the championship is ours CHARLIE: Three balls, two strikes The bases were loaded With two men out I pitched my curve but somehow he hit it A good strong clout “Lucy," I hollered “It's coming right to you" She caught it as easy as pie Then dropped it I don't think it's good For a team's morale To see their manager cry -Snoopy helped out by biting a runner GIRL: Yee-ow! CHARLIE [SINGING]: And catching the ball in his teeth Linus caught flies From a third-story window By holding his blanket beneath [CHARLIE SINGING ON-SCREEN TEXT] And one run would win us the game As I came up to bat LUCY: All right, Charlie Brown. We're all behind you. Well, sort of. I mean, this man can't pitch. He pitches like my grandmother. Come on, Charlie Brown, hit it out of the park. Now, all you have to do is bear down. Just bear down. ALL [SINGING]: All we have to do is win One more game And the championship is ours. [CHARLIE SINGING ON-SCREEN TEXT] CHARLIE [SINGING]: And me with one strike to go Then I saw her This cute little red-headed girl I know Firmly I vowed I would win it for her And I shouldered my bat and I swung-- Unh. [ALL GROAN] [CHARLIE SINGING ON-SCREEN TEXT] CHARLIE [SINGING]: On how I can get where you are? [CHARLIE SINGING ON-SCREEN TEXT] -Okay, switch channels. -Are you kidding? What makes you think you can come right in here and take over? These five fingers. Individually, they are nothing. But when I curl them together into a single unit... ...they become a fighting force terrible to behold. Which channel do you want? Why can't you guys get organized like that? Linus, do you know what I intend? I intend to be a queen. When I grow up, I am gonna be the biggest queen there ever was. LUCY: And I'll live in this big palace with a big front lawn... ...and have lots of beautiful dresses to wear. And when I go out in my coach, all the people-- LINUS: Lucy. -All the people will wave... ...and I will shout at them and-- Lucy, I believe queen is an inherited title. Yes, I'm quite sure. A person can only become a queen... ...by being born into a royal family of the correct lineage... ...so that she can assume the throne after the death of the reigning monarch. I can't think of any possible way that you could ever become a queen. I'm sorry, Lucy, but it's true. And in the summertime, I will go to my summer palace. LUCY: And I'll wear my crown in swimming and everything. And all the people will cheer and I will shout at them. And I'll-- What do you mean I can't be queen? It's true. There must be a loophole. This kind of thing always has a loophole. Nobody should be kept from being queen if she wants to be one. It's undemocratic. Oh, good grief. It's usually just a matter of knowing the right people. I bet a few pieces of well-placed correspondence... ...and I get to be a queen in no time. I think I'll watch TV. I know what I'll do. If I can't be a queen, then I'll be very rich. I'll work and work until I'm very, very rich. And then I will buy myself a queendom. Oh, good grief. Yes, I'll buy myself a queendom. And then I'll kick out the old queen and take over the whole operation myself. LUCY: I'll be head queen. And when I go out in my coach... ...all the people will shout at me and they’'ll-- They-- -What happened to your queendom? -Huh? What happened to your queendom? Oh, that. I've given it up. I've decided to devote my life to cultivating my natural beauty. CHARLIE: I think lunchtime is about the worst time of day for me... ...always having to sit here alone. Of course, sometimes mornings aren't so pleasant either. [RINGS] CHARLIE: Waking up and wondering if anyone would really miss me... ...if I never got out of bed. Then there's the night too. Lying there and thinking about all the stupid things... ...I've done during the day. And all those hours in between, when I do all those stupid things. Well, lunchtime is among the worst times of the day for me. Well, I guess I'd better see what I've got. Peanut butter. Some psychiatrists say... ...that people who eat peanut butter sandwiches are lonely. I guess they're right. And when you're really lonely... ...the peanut butter sticks to the roof of your mouth. There's that cute little red-headed girl eating her lunch over there. I wonder what she would do if I went over and asked her... ...if I could sit and have lunch with her. She'd probably laugh right in my face. It's hard on a face when it gets laughed in. There's an empty place next to her on the bench. There's no reason why I couldn't just go over and sit there. I could do that right now. All I have to do is stand up. I'm standing up. I'm sitting down. I'm a coward. I'm so much of a coward, she wouldn't even think of looking at me. She hardly ever does look at me. In fact, I can't remember her ever looking at me. Why shouldn't she look at me? Is there any reason in the world why she shouldn’t look at me? Is she so great and I'm so small that she can't spare one little moment? [GASPS] CHARLIE: She's looking at me. She's looking at me. You're thinking of that other dress. The one I wore to Lucinda's party. The one I'm talking about was the very light blue one. It had a design embroidered around the waist. I don't remember. Something like this. And the skirt went out like this: And had these puffy sleeves and a sash like this: Oh, yes, I remember. Yes, well that was the dress I was wearing last week when I met Frieda. And she told me she'd seen one just like it over at that place on-- CHARLIE: Lunchtime is among the worst times of the day for me. If that little red-headed girl is looking at me... ...with this stupid bag over my head... ...she must think I'm the biggest fool alive. But if she isn't looking at me... ...then maybe I could take it off quickly and she'd never notice it. On the other hand... ...I can't tell if she's looking until I take it off. Then again, if I never take it off... ...I'll never have to know if she was looking or not. On the other hand, it's very hard to breathe in here. Whew. She's not looking at me. I wonder why she never looks at me. Oh, well, another lunch hour over with. Only 2863 to go. [SINGING SOLFEGGIO] That's very good, Sally. Where is everybody? I told them to be here. If we don't rehearse, we can't sing at the assembly tomorrow. Charlie Brown? Linus? Luc--? Give me that pencil, you blockhead. No. Not till you give me back my crayons. That's my best pencil, you block-- If you don't give me that pencil, I'll tell Sally what you said about her. Stop that. We've got to rehearse. You're late. What did you say about me, Linus? -He said-- -Lucy. Stop that. -I'm sorry I'm late but Snoopy needed-- -There's no time to be sorry. [LUCY WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] -What did he say? -He said that-- Quiet! Now, remember, this is a mood piece. We must paint a picture with music and words. And concentrate. Remember, adagio con brio. ALL [SINGING]: Oh, give me a home Where the buffalo roam Where the deer and the antelope play Give me my pencil ALL: Where seldom is heard A discouraging word LINUS: Not on your life ALL: And the skies are not cloudy all day SALLY: If you don't tell me what you told Lucy, I'm going to-- LUCY: Give me my pencil you blockhead ALL: Home, home on the range -Give me my pencil -No. ALL: Where the deer and the antelope play LINUS: Not until you promise not to tell her-- What are you trying to do? Stifle my freedom of speech? ALL: Where seldom is heard LUCY: Give me my pencil ALL: A discouraging word LINUS: No promise, no pencil ALL: And the skies are not cloudy all day -What pencil? -No. ALL [SINGING]: Oh, give me a land LUCY: Give me that pencil ALL: Where the bright diamond sand SALLY: Linus, that just isn't fair ALL: Flows leisurely down the stream -Why did you take Sally's pencil? -Ugh! ALL: Where the graceful white swan Goes gliding along -What did he call me? -He said-- CHARLIE & SCHROEDER: Like a maid in a heavenly dream He said you were an enigma -An enigma? CHARLIE: An enigma? ALL:Home, home on the range SALLY [SINGING]: Boy, that makes me-- What a terrible thing to call a-- What's an enigma? Never mind! CHARLIE & SCHROEDER [SINGING]: Where the deer [SINGING] What's an enigma? CHARLIE: What's an enigma? LUCY & SCHROEDER: And the antelope play Hey, he's still got my pencil. BOTH [SINGING]: Where seldom is heard A discouraging word -And the skies are not cloudy all day -Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh [GASPS] SNOOPY: My stomach clock just went off. It’s suppertime... ...and Charlie Brown has forgotten to feed me. [SIGHS] Here I lie, a withering, hollow shell of a dog. And there sits my supper dish... ...empty. Well, that's all right. It's okay. He'll remember. Tomorrow after school... ...when no little furry friend comes to greet him. Then he’'ll remember. And he'll rush out here to the dog house but it'll be too late. There will be nothing left but the dried carcass of the former friend... ...who used to run and play so happily with him. Nothing left but the bleached bones... -...of the once-happy little puppy. -Hey, are you asleep? I've been standing here a whole minute with your supper dish. It's suppertime. SNOOPY: Suppertime? Suppertime? SNOOPY [SINGING]: Behold the brimming bowl Of meat and meal Which is brought forth To ease our hunger Behold the flowing flagon Moist and sweet Which has been sent to slake our thirst Okay there's no need for a big production. Just get down off that doghouse and eat. [SNOOPY SCATTING] SNOOPY [SINGING] It's suppertime Yes, it's suppertime Oh, it's sup, sup, suppertime Very best time of day Suppertime, oh, it's suppertime And when suppertime comes Can supper be far away? Bring on the soup dish, bring on the cup Bring on the bacon and fill me up ‘Cause it's supper Supper, supper, suppertime Yeah. Whoo! Yeehaw. [SCATTING] Woo-hoo. [SINGING] Bring on the dog food, bring on the bone Bring on the barrel and roll me home ‘Cause it's supper, supper, supper Supper, super pepper-upper Supper, super-duper suppertime Wintertime's nice with the ice and snow Summertime's nice with a place to go Bedtime, overtime, halftime too But they just can't hold a candle To my suppertime Oh, yeah.

Yeehaw! Whoo! Now, wait a minute, Snoopy. Hey, get down. You're spilling it all over. Now, cut that out. Why can’'t you eat your meal quietly and calmly like any other normal dog? SNOOPY: What's wrong with making mealtime a joyous occasion? [SCATTING] Well, I don't know, Linus. It looks like an airplane, the way the lights are blinking on and off. Schroeder, it that an airplane or a star? I believe that is a star. But it could be a planet, you know. Or maybe even a satellite. It could be a satellite. I wonder. Well, we'll never find out by just standing here. -Where are you going? -I'm going over here to get a better look. SNOOPY: I like to sit up here after supper and listen to the sounds of the night. But something seems to be missing. [HOWLS] In my opinion, that was exactly what was needed. CHARLIE: I'm so happy. That little red-headed girl dropped her pencil. It has teeth marks all over it. She nibbles her pencil. She's human. I guess it hasn't been such a bad day after all. [SINGING] Happiness is finding a pencil [SINGING] Knowing a secret [SINGING] Telling the time LUCY [SINGING]: Happiness is learning to whistle [WOODSTOCK WHISTLING] Tying your shoe for the very first time Happiness is playing the drum In your own school band CHARLIE: And happiness is walking hand in hand Happiness is two kinds of ice cream SNOOPY [SINGING]: Pizza with sausage [SINGING] Climbing a tree Happiness is five different crayons -Catching a firefly -Setting him free Happiness is being alone Every now and then ALL: And happiness is coming home again Happiness is morning and evening Daytime and nighttime too For happiness is anyone And anything at all That's loved by you Happiness is having a sister Sharing a sandwich BOTH: Getting along ALL: Happiness is singing together When day is through And happiness Is those who sing with you [SNOOPY HOWLS AND WOODSTOCK TWEETS] Happiness is morning and evening Daytime and nighttime too For happiness is anyone And anything at all That's loved by you You're a good man, Charlie Brown. LUCY: If only you weren’t so wishy-washy.
