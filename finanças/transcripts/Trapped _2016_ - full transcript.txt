As we know from Charles Darwin, it's all about survival of the fittest... Now what would I do if I was exploring the wilds... And I'd run out of supplies? Say I was in the Sahara Desert or the Amazon rainforest... or even trapped in a small room... What would I do for that vital source of nourishment? I'll tell you A cockroach! Now this little fella is packed full of protein. Not only that, it can survive for 1 month without food. So what do I suggest? I suggest taking this, putting it on your tongue and... You've never eaten chicken before? Never. Why not? No one eats it in my family. Why? It's against our religion. But I have religious friends. they eat non-vegetarian food. It's their bad karma. They'll pay for it some day. So I'll also have bad karma because I'm eating chicken? I'm not saying that... You're a nice girl so it will balance itself out. And you're a bad guy but you don't eat chicken... so that balances itself out. Are you one of those people? That support the beef ban? Yes. How is that okay? Shouldn't it be about freedom of choice? It's my decision. Who are you to tell me what I can or cannot eat? You or anyone for that matter. I'm not forcing anyone. I'm just being honest. I don't like it. It's wrong. Why do you have to kill to eat? It's not wrong... Animals kill each other for food in the wild. Because... We are also animals. Have you ever seen a lion eating boiled potatoes? They can't. But we can eat this. Yes, but we can also eat this. That's wrong. How is it wrong? Is it okay to kill someone for food? To take a life? Have you seen videos of animals being slaughtered? That's okay? If I fancy eating a family member of yours... Would you let me? They'll defend themselves. Precisely. Kill animals because they can't speak... Just because it's yummy. It's a bit strange, isn't it? Why... Why? Why? Want to hear a joke? A group of rats were hanging out... when a sexy elephant passed by... You know what one rat said? 36,000 - 24,000 - 36,000 Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... Welcome to "Chat with Rat" Are you all listening? Can you hear me? Because no else can hear me. I'll show you... Watchman... What's the plan? This door won't break, not in this lifetime. Can't jump from the window. No point in shouting. Everyone out there is deaf... Or doesn't give a damn. The balcony on the 30th floor doesn't have a grill... But to get there we'll have to cut through this one. And the only tools we have... A useless fan blade. A tube-light starter. A metal plate from the AC. And our pan. If we succeed... we still have to climb down 5 floors without any safety gear. One small mistake and... Watchman... The apartment downstairs may not even be open... That's the risk. But there's no option. Soon we will run out of water... You'll sneak away through some pipe or drain... I'll die here. I don't want to die here... Come what may, I won't die here. I want to get out... Eat Pav Bhaji swimming in butter. Go to the beach and swim... Eat sweet ice candy. Travel in a crowded train. Sweaty... Stinky... I want to get pushed around. Fight with the conductor. I want to brawl. Go to office. Meet Noorie! Get married! Have many baby Noorie's and Shaurya's? I don't want to die here. Go...

What you don't know is going to get you killed.
