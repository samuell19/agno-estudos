Generations have passed. A girl has evolved. Right from cooking at home, she has transcended to the level of being commended and saluted. And yet, when some brutes, masquerading as men, hunt her down she ends up lifeless. That is why, let us save girls by protecting our mothers. Remember, their safety is our responsibility. I'M ALWAYS INDEBTED TO MY GRANDFATHER, MR. SAYYAPURAJU KRISHNAM RAJU. - KARTHIK DANDU We shouldn't spare this couple. They are casting black magic on our children. Surround the house! - Hey! - Hey! Break the door! Hey! This guy is using black magic on our kids. He should not be spared. Kill them! Kill him! He doesn't deserve to live. Hey! Drag her out! You have unjustly killed our kids! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! We'll burn you! Please don't hurt her. Mom! Mom! He is still chanting mantras. He doesn't seem satisfied yet. How could you kill our kids? You will rot in hell! They deserve death. Pour it! Why are you hesitating, Priest? Unless we burn them to death, the village won't be free from the curse. Mom! Mom! You will rot in hell! Good riddance from the curse! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! By the next Pushkara, this village will turn into a graveyard! He shares the same blood. It will be better for the village to kill him. - Yes. - Hey, stop it. All in all, he might get their looks since he is their kin. We don't know if he would have the same mentality! Let's not commit the sin of killing a child. All things said and done, sir, we don't want their offspring to grow up in this village. - Yes! - That's all. Fine then. Father! Father! Father! Our only source of entertainment has stopped working. When you said village, I thought it is only away from the city. I had no clue that it was away from the world, Aunt! You feel the distance, but I feel the proximity to my village. That's how you feel when you fall asleep at the start and directly wake up at the end of the journey. Couldn't you send them signed papers if they asked you about the land for the school? Why do we have to set out with bags like school-going kids? How can you say that? I was born and brought up here. It's been fifteen years since my last visit. The only girl child I have is my sister's daughter, Parvathi. Let's spend a few days with her, attend the fair, and go back. - Okay? - Sure. Let's first reach Rudravanam though. Hey! It's been such a happy journey so far. What is this bad omen? - Stop it, Mom! - Hey, Surya! What is so strange about crows in a forest? Mom, get in. Come on, Mom. Get in! Hey, start the car. RUDRAVANAM 1 KM In the Prajothpatti year, during the month of Shravana, on the coming Saturday which is Ekadashi, at 9:42 a.m. the pot shall be installed. The fair is on Monday. Start the work before any obstacle befalls. - Okay, sir! - Okay. - You all have understood him? - Yes, sir! During the fair, make sure the outsiders don't face any inconvenience. Make arrangements for cool sheds, - food, and water. - Yes, sir! Why don't we arrange a toddy and chicken? They can drink and dance. After all, that's what makes a fair exciting. Oh, Mr. Abbairaju! What brings you here? Everyone has their noses in the air. You only see those seated in the chairs, not the ones standing next to them. That's why, I'm marrying off my daughter in a family where her father-in-law sits in the assembly. Now you will know my worth. Don't take his words seriously. Call Siddaiah and get the bangies ready. It's been a week since anyone saw Sidda. God knows where he is! Okay. If he turns up, he will do it, or let his son make the bangy ready. What do you say? Hey, you? Okay, sir. Anasuyamma brought her whole family to the fair. Dear! My aunt's family is here! Yeah, coming! We brought a pumpkin from home, right? Bring it. I forgot! They are here already. The house isn't completely cleaned yet. - Auntie! - Parvathi! - How are you? - I am good, Auntie. Had a pleasant journey? Yes. All good. It went well. Hey, do you still get frightened? Cranky fellow. Call me cranky again and I will leave right now. Shall I? - As you wish! - Sister! Aren't you over your ear-scratching habit yet? - Wait, man. - Why would she? Her habit has given her ear pain. Any chance she gets she pours oil in her ear. It's enough for seasoning. Are you done complaining? Pass me the pumpkin. Your complaints are endless. Parvathi, where is your baby boy? He is at home, Auntie. I will bring him here by the time you shower. Hey! These crows don't sleep at all?! Hey, why are you cribbing? How am I going to survive for 15 days in a place which thinks seven is midnight? Look at the village. It's so peaceful! I am going to drink. Bloody, I am going to! Thief! Thief! Hey, Blabbermouth! Hey, Gavarayya! Thief! Get him! - Thief? Where? - Here. Come, fast. Hens and goats tend to go missing! We must nab the thief today. Let's go! Come! Catch them! - Which side did he go to? - Suri, cover that side. - Ramana, come with me. - Let's go, come! - Come along! - Let's go. Check that side. - Can you see anyone there? - No. Hey! Let go. - I said, leave... - I saw the thief go here. - Who are you? - Go and search! - Check there, as well. - Let me go! Hey! If I get my hands on the thief today, I won't spare him! Hey, man! You go that way. - Cuticura! - Look there. So the thieves here use talcum powder? Let me go! - Leave the rooster and go. - I'm sure she's somewhere here. If I leave it, - it will die in the cock fight tomorrow. - Have you seen anybody? - Will you listen to me? - Suri, how about you? If we are caught, you'll land yourself in a much bigger mess for holding my hand rather than me getting in trouble for stealing a chicken. How dare you blackmail me when you're at fault? When we decided to build the school, you were the first person I called. I am elated that you said yes without any second thoughts. Nothing can make me happier than letting the village make use of my property. It's all thanks to the blessings of Goddess Modamamaba. Please have. It's late already. Stop! Don't eat! Madam is bringing some curry for you all. - Tell her to hurry. - Yes. Madam! Hurry. Who's the other girl? She is my daughter. Maybe you don't remember her. You last saw her when she was little. Cuticura... You spoke so much about her last night, that I can even smell the talcum now. Stop it. Anasuyamma, this is my daughter Nandini. Cuti... cura. He wants some more curry. Serve him. Is that what the old man understood? Enough. I will arrange for snacks in the evening. Please do come. It took us two hours to eat. Now it will take us two days to digest it! - Very difficult, sir. - Come on, son! You are young enough to digest that much. You are the chicken thief, right? Listen to me! You aren't on your best behavior. Neither last night nor now. But the curry was great. Especially, the country chicken. Delicious! That wasn't country chicken. It was last night's chicken. It defeated my rooster in the cockfight. That's why I killed it and cooked it. I don't care whether it's a chicken or a man... if they're wagging their tail! We will see. Nandini! The doctor is here. Why are you staring at me? I want you to get better but you won't step out of the village. You need injections but you won't step out of the house. Like a queen, you want... - What happened to Nandini, brother? - everything presented at your feet. Since childhood, she is prone to convulsions. She needs an injection every week. Otherwise, they come back more severely. Why are your eyes red? I was afraid of your injection and couldn't sleep the whole night. Is it? Harishchandra! Your daughter says she can't sleep at night. Find a nice city boy and get her married. You won't have to find doctors and I won't have to scold her. Unless you marry her off, she won't come to her senses. Clean this. Have you brought the songbooks? Yeah. Oh! New songbooks! How long do we meet secretly? What can I do? My dad insists that I marry my cousin. I don't know what to do. Cousin? What cousin? - Don't shout. - What cousin? Who is he? Don't shout. Softly. Don't make noise. Who is this cousin? What are you doing here? If they have finished talking, this guy wants to talk to you. They? What are you talking about? - I don't see anyone here! - Oh, my! Enough with the drama. You stand guard and let them meet. That means you believe in love. Listen to me. They like each other. So I helped them. What's the problem? My love and I are ready. When will you come aboard? You already said you and your love are ready. Three is not a good number. - Oh, my! - Oh, my! I can't bear this much smartness. Hello, please come out. - Love birds! Come out! - Come! Come! - No, no! Damn it. - You have been caught. Better come out. Come on. Come out. She is the girl that we saw yesterday. Oh! It's you! Yes, it's me. Sudha. And you? I am Kumar. - Surya. - Hello. - Any news of Siddha? - No. Oh, my! He's here already. Go and hide. Hide! Who is this new guy? Sudha! Who is that stranger with you? Come on! He must be Mr. Suri's relative. You and your curiosity! You and your big mouth. I told you not to meet me in the village. You never listen! Now, look. We have been found by the wrong person. Now I can't meet you here anymore. Why not? I will tell them he is my relative. Whenever you want to meet, I will bring Kumar. You bring Nandini along with you. That's all. Nice angle, bro. Nandini! That sounds good. Shut up and come. Take care. - See you. - Yes. Hey, Sudha. Can we go now? Hey! You leave. I fell in love with you The day I set my eyes on you I fell in love with you Seeing your playful acts quite a few With an attitude that's unhesitating You leap with courage that's unwavering When you stand before me You look at me like a stranger Don't you have any fear at all? You do what you want and stand tall! I fell in love with you The day I set my eyes on you Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Just when I think I know you, The next moment you become an enigma You dab arrogance with humility Your half sari makes you look Tradition personified But, baby, if I believe that It will be my own fault You mesmerize me with your charm I fell in love with you The day I set... Stitch me a pair of clothes for the fair. Okay, collect them a day before the fair. Do you have a sample blouse for the measurements? Yes. Nandini, please talk to him. I am scared. Look! Sudha isn't interested in you. They are looking for other matches for her. It will be better if you both don't meet again. Leave. Let's go. Not you. Let Sudha say it. Then I will leave. Listen to me. Doesn't matter if I say it or Sudha, it's all the same. Sudha, look into my eyes and tell me. Do you like me or not? I like you a lot. I will go with you. I won't marry the boy my father selects. Hey, fool! When you love him so much, what are you afraid of? If your family disapproves, you can go elsewhere and live. But how can you give up on your love? Sudha! I want to talk to you. Nandini, I will talk to him and come back. Enjoy. Enjoy. Your semblance says one thing But your speech says another You mask your heart You overcome your affliction And conceal your affection There is an entire world within you Give me a spot in some corner there With an attitude that's unhesitating You leap with courage that's unwavering When you stand before me You look at me like a stranger Don't you have any fear at all? You do what you want and stand tall! I fell in love with you The day I set my eyes on you I fell in love with you Seeing your playful acts quite a few May you be blessed with health, longevity, and wealth. - Hasn't your ear stopped hurting?! - No! - Why is Auntie here with everyone? - No idea! What happened, Auntie? I am here to gift my daughter a sari for the fair. Auntie, sari's fine. But what's with the papers? If I come every year, a sari makes a good enough gift. But it's been so long since my last visit. And I don't know when I will come back again. Why should we leave the house vacant? And why should you live in this small house? That house is yours from now. What do you mean? How is it my house? - Sister! - I can't accept this. I knew she would refuse. Go ahead. Nandini, present it to her. Ask her to accept it, Shivaiah. Hold it. Hey, no. Why are there tears? I'll leave. One minute, Auntie. Nandini! Wait. Don't go on foot. Surya will drop you off. It's okay, sister. Why bother him? I'll walk. I said, wait. They love girls so much that they present them with a house. Why won't they drop you at home? Wait. - Surya! - Yes, sister! Drop Nandini at home. Surya! Tell her what you have in mind. - All your work here would be done then. - Just watch! Before coming here... I wondered how I would spend two weeks in the village. But ever since I met you, I find it difficult to leave the village, Nandini. But... I must tell you something before I leave. I know. I know. Your eyes will look at me angrily when I say it. But I want to live with that anger forever. What's wrong, Nandini? Stop the vehicle, Surya. Nandini! I have a lot of work. I need to go. Wait! What happened, Nandini? I have never seen you like this before. Your mom... reminded me of my mom, Surya. But my mother is only a memory. Memories only leave tears behind. Forget it! I have heard that when two people in love come together... the departed ones find their way back. Marry me, Nandini. I will bring your mom back for you. Listen to me. I have a lot of work. I need to go. You can't always have the upper hand. You need to listen to the other person, as well. Please, listen! Nandini! The day I leave this place, until the very last moment... I will wait for your answer. Whatever your answer is, I will accept it. Can you at least spell it out? Mother! What is this bad omen? Hey, it's Siddha. What has become of Siddha? Hey! It's Siddaiah. What could have happened to him? Why is he acting weird? Your dad's inside the temple. - What happened? - Your dad's inside the temple. Father! Oh, no! What is this sacrilege? Goddess Modamamaba! Father! Wait dear, wait! - Father! - Don't go inside! Father! Don't go inside. Father! Father! How did this happen? - Father! - God knows where he came from! But he walked straight into the inner sanctum and died vomiting blood. Father! A death in the inner sanctum... is inauspicious. Father! In the entire history of the temple... it is the first time that such a horrific incident has happened. Get the edicts to find a remedy. - Goddess Modamamaba! - Goddess Modamamaba! What are these edicts? - A custom in the village... - Son! At the time of the installation of the deity, along with rules and regulations, a few edicts were written down. Whether it is the village or the temple, whenever there is a problem, we always find a solution there. Crisis! A huge crisis! God knows what will happen now! Mother Goddess, who's supposed to leave the fair for her parental home in all her glory, has to be stalled in the temple itself. There was a death in the temple. Mother Goddess is desecrated. - Mother Goddess is desecrated. - She is desecrated. All of us are her children. So this applies to us, as well. So as to not become victims of her wrath... and to contain the debacle with this death... there's only one solution. Sealing of the eight directions. - Sealing of the eight directions! - Eight directions. Since Goddess Modamamaba is the form of eight Goddesses, from sunset today, for eight nights and eight days, we shall keep the temple as well as the village under lockdown. We will be doomed if the village is under a lockdown. For eight days, commuting is prohibited. Idols, pictures, talismans, and... everything related to God should be in the temple before the cordon is put up. The temple should be under serpent lock. During these eight days when God is not with us... to avoid the influence of evil powers, our only way to protect ourselves... is through the eight-way seal. Hey, let's go. Why is he leaving mid-conversation? Priest, we are adopting this practice for the first time. What if we make a mistake? If that does happen, Rudravanam will no longer have the Goddess's blessings. Priest! Edicts and precepts should open ways to a solution. Why would they close paths? Surya... Those who don't belong in the village, don't get defiled. Outsiders who came for the fair, please leave the village before sunset. Madam! You didn't breathe this air for 12 years. Hence, you are free to leave. Today at 6:08 p.m., we shall close the temple and the village in all eight directions. Chief, please make the necessary arrangements. Chief! Abbairaju is going out of the village. Let's see how he abandons the rituals and leaves the village. Dear... Don't get down. Why are you blocking the road? You cannot cross the border. - Yes, you can't. - You can't. Who are you to tell me that? I don't care about your traditions and norms. You should! You were born and brought up here, why wouldn't the tradition apply to you? This rule applies to all. No one is exempted. I am leaving for my daughter's wedding. Your traditions and practices may cancel her wedding. My daughter's life is at stake. You can find some other auspicious time for the wedding. But if you defy the edicts, everyone will fall prey to the wrath of the Goddess. - Move, move! - Get going! - Move! - Get going! Mom! Hey! All of you, stop! This is for the well-being of our village, Abbairaju. Go on. I am leaving for now. But a day will come when you will be able to break through the seal of the eight directions, but not Abbairaju. Mark my words. This is a message to the people of Rudravanam village. The Chief is distributing provisions in view of the eight-day lockdown. All those in need can come and collect them. -As per the order of the Priest, -Give them some more. all outsiders must leave the village immediately! The desecration is not confined to the Goddess and us. It also applies to the clothes offered. Throw them into the fire. You came here after a long time, but you have been asked to leave so soon. I feel bad, Auntie. Hey! Do you still think Nandini will show up? The day I leave this place, until the very last moment... I will wait for your answer. Surya! You better get going. The ritual has begun at the outskirts. Okay, sister. We will take your leave. Both of you can come over whenever you are free. Parvathi! Take care. Dear Nandini! Dear Nandini! Dear! Nandini! Hey! Take the keys. Nothing will happen to you. Don't be hasty. I'll collect it from everyone. I told you I'll collect it! My precious! Her veins have stiffened. Where are the new injections from the city? Where is the injection? Look for it! - Injection! Parvathi, look in her room. - Okay, sir! Hey, Kittaiha! Search over there! Dear! Nandini! Nothing will happen to you. - The bottle is broken. - Dear! Nandini! Damn it! All the injections are broken. If she doesn't get the injection in half an hour... - she will be at risk. - Nandini, dear! Dear! Please don't say that. I don't care about the lockdown. I'll do anything to save my daughter! Help me up. Move aside! I have to stop the lockdown. I have to stop the lockdown. - Hello! - Sastry! Mr. Koti. Tell me. I gave medicine for convulsions to an old man from your village, remember? Bring it here right now. No entry or exit to the village. - God knows what happened! - Exactly. Hey! Something has happened there. - Stop, please stop. - Please, stop. There was an accident. He has lost a lot of blood. He needs to be taken to a hospital immediately. Get him, quick! Sir. Careful. - Sir, please help. - What happened? It's not me you should be helping, sir. It's the chief of Rudravanam's daughter. She is fighting for her life. The RMP had called me. These medicines should reach the village as soon as possible. - Please make sure she gets them, brother. - Nandini! Don't think, just go. Close the boundary with sesame seeds. Don't stop. Nandini! Please save me, Mother. Hey, I heard some noise. Let's go and check. Let's go. Who's there? Who is it? Who is it? - Hey, go there and check. - Yes. Mother Modamamaba, please forgive me. Did you get the tickets? Give them to me, Kumar! When will the train arrive? Hey, don't panic! You are already here. Your folks won't step out for eight days. Why are you still afraid? Kumar! I left everyone for you. You will look after me, right? Hey! I will always look after you. Okay? Do you know how scared I was while passing the temple? Isn't it enough that you are scared of the Deity in your village? That you're afraid to be here, as well? I have kept your breakfast there. Have it. How is Nandini, sister? - She's okay. - Give it to me! She is very stubborn. She would rather fall sick in the village than leave it for her treatment. When you proposed to her, the thought of leaving the village and moving to the city must have frightened her. But how can you give up your job and settle down in the village for her? Nandini should understand. Sister! Just tell me that Nandini is interested in me. Mom and I will come and settle here. If that happens, I will eat only once a day throughout my life. Sister! Don't talk rubbish! When you are surrounded by your people, who needs food to survive? Nandini! The doctor asked you to stay in bed. Why are you here? I... Why did you come back, Surya? So that I could live? If not today, I will die tomorrow, Surya. I will be with you even then, Nandini. Listen to me! Unlike you, I don't know how to live with love. I only live on memories like this. What is this? This is my mother's memory. It has been with me for all these years. If it is with you, it is equivalent to me being with you. I don't know how to love like you do. How much is my love, Nandini? It's as little as going away because you said no. But your love... It's as deep as dying so that I could come back. Mounting a winged horse among the clouds, he came down flying! Look! Here, look at this picture. See here. Don't play with that. Who's there? Do you know what happened then? A huge flying horse... I was telling you... Who is it? Hold this. Why don't you answer? Who is it? Who is it? Suri! Is that you? Suri! What happened? Why are you crying? Why aren't you responding? Suri! Suri! Suri! What is it? What happened? - Parvathi! Parvathi! - Suri? Parvathi! What happened? Shivaiah! Take Parvathi away. I think she is in shock after witnessing his death. Parvathi! Come, let's go home! Bloody drunkard! He borrowed money from the whole village and now he has ended up like this. Just the other day, I questioned him about my money. He said, "I don't have a penny on me. I have no other choice but to die." But I never thought he would actually do it. Milkman Suri has killed himself. Nandini! Where is Nandini... She's in her room. Mr. Harischandra Prasad? He went out! Oh, okay! What are you doing here? The bigger the eyes, the deeper the love. Do you know that? Let me go! Move. I have to go. I must go to your sister. I won't leave. Is that the case? Dad... What is it? When did he come? She said he was not at home! Oh, no! Parvathi! Oh, God! If it really happens, I will eat only one meal a day throughout my life. When you are surrounded by your dear ones, who needs food to survive? Open up to her. You will have achieved what you came for then. I am damn sure Parvathi didn't commit suicide. She told me many times how much her ear pain was bothering her. The village is already paranoid. Why are there deaths happening for trivial reasons? Even the basil plant has waned. Do you think there is a reason behind it? There is no worship happening anywhere. So, it is natural that the basil has waned. Based on what you said, there could only be two reasons. Either she killed herself because she was unable to bear the pain. Or... someone has transgressed the rules of the eight-way seal. - Did anyone break the rules? - No, sir! Forget the rules. A death last night and a body this morning. The cremation ground is outside the village. Where do we cremate them? Decide that first. How can you be so insensitive, Abbairaju? Don't ask me, Karanam. Ask the elders who marked the borders. There is no cemetery in the village, shall we conduct the cremation in your house, Priest? Abbairaju! Mr. Harischandra Prasad! It's okay if words cross the limit. But no man should cross the border. That was our rule. - Brahmaiah! - Sir! Knock on every door and check whether all 351 members are at home or not. Okay, sir. Let's go! I didn't get the answer yet. The abandoned house at the end of the village in the north... can be used for cremation. - Is your father at home? - Yes! Let me check! - Where is your son? - He went to carry Parvathi's body. Oh! Okay! Hey, come over here. What happened? - Has anyone been at our home yet? - No. Bodayya! Sattayya! Is everyone at home? Everyone's home. Yes, everyone's at home. Let's go. Where is Sudha? I haven't seen her for the last two days. Sudha! Sudha! - She is bathing. - Oh! Okay! - Hey, did you search that street? - Yes. What happened? I thought she only brought us disgrace by running away. But she left the village and put our lives in danger. If there is anyone left, please come forward. Parvathi is very fond of you. Try calling her. Go. Sis... Sir... Everyone is present, sir. Look over there. What the heck is happening here? Take it away. Swami! Don't blow the conch over a corpse. This isn't a graveyard. It's a village. Cremating inside the village?! This means... that the village has become a graveyard! An evil power has taken over the village. Remove the eight-direction seal. Occult is being conducted in the village. If we don't take action now, these deaths will turn into a pandemic... and annihilate the entire village. If you co-operate, I will find a solution to this problem. Swami! One step inside and you will be defying the rule. If the edicts were so great... then why were there four deaths after sealing the eight paths? You are mistaken. Only two people died here. That is your ignorance. There is a process involved in these deaths. When you realize that, your belief will change. Shiva! It's your responsibility now. Until they open up the temple, let's not even come near the village border. It's fine even if our business stops for a few days. Let's go! Surya, let's go. Parvathi didn't commit suicide. She had a problem with her left ear. Why would she pierce her right ear and die? Do you think what Aghora said is true? I will find the reason behind Parvathi's death. I will certainly find out what it is. Did Surya really commit suicide because of his debts? Nothing of that sort, sir. Madam, on the day of his death or the day before that... was he acting strange or was he afraid? Nothing like that, son. - Kanthamma! - What is it, dear? You know that milkman Suri died, right? Did he come here that day? I waited for him till four in the morning. He didn't show up. If Suri didn't come here after leaving his home, something must have happened on the way. Get on the bike. Suri used to walk to the temple from his home. What's that smell? It's the rancid smell of a decayed body. Surya! Don't go there! That's a quagmire! Pull! Whose bicycle is this? It's milkman Suri's. There's nothing here like you suspected, sir. Sudha! You were harping on about your honor and now your daughter has been killed! You said that they would kill us if she crossed the border. Oh, my! She chose to die inside the village. Now live as long as you want. This village is afflicted, Surya. Sudha had crossed the border. I found these tickets in her bag. She definitely went to the station and came back. Why did Sudha come back in the first place? Only Kumar can answer that question. But how do we get a hold of him now? - Nandini! Nandini! - Son! Nandini is not well. She has been depressed since Parvathi madam's death. Just once, I want to talk to Nandini. No, Surya. She is still mourning Parvathi. If you ask her about Kumar now, you will have to inform her about Sudha's death. - Hello, Lova railway station. - Yes! How can I help you? Did a young couple come to the station on Monday at midnight to go to Kirandol? What took you so long? We sent the body to the Rajahmundry morgue. Body? What do you mean? The poor boy must be drowsy when he was hit by the train. I have no idea what happened to the girl who was with him. Who are you by the way? Hello! - What happened, Surya? - Hello... Kumar died in a train accident. He's dead? Are you sure it was him? Hello? This body is crushed to a pulp. Hello? Hey, the body is Kumar's. What is happening there? How is Sudha? Hello! Why were there four deaths despite the eight-way seal? Occult is being employed in the village. There is a process involved in these deaths. When you realize that, your belief will change. Hey, Surya! Priest! Keep your customs and traditions aside and hear me out. Aghora spoke the truth. Are the deaths making you say this? The hermit is still wrong. There were only three deaths. The fourth death causing the other three, happened the day Sudha stepped out. Did they cross the eight-way seal? Mother Modamamaba! Something's wrong. The day the eight-way seal was placed, Sudha crossed the border for her love. When the boy died in the train accident, Sudha was right there. Having seen his death, when Sudha was returning to the village, she was attacked by honeybees. Milkman Suri, who was on his way to the cow shed, tried to save Sudha. But Sudha was already dead. Having seen Sudha's death, Suri committed suicide the next day in front of my sister Parvathi. Later Parvathi committed suicide. Whoever is watching the death first, is dying next. Then... who witnessed Parvathi's death first? I must go to your sister's place. Nandini! Nandini madam! Why are you going that way? Nandini madam! Nandini! Hey, you! Why isn't she responding? Nandini! Sir! Nandini is going towards the old house, sir. She didn't respond to my holler. I'm scared. Nandini madam! Hey! Nandini! Nandini! Nandini! - Madam! - Careful. - Hey, bring the bench. - Bring the bench! Quick! Hey! Get a pillow. Nandini. Nandini. Nandini! Nandini! Hey, hold her legs down. Nandini! Hey, hold her legs down. Nandini! Keys! - Dear! - Nandini! - Nandini! - Nandini... Nandini... What the heck is happening here? People are dying for no reason! The same thing happened twelve years ago. It was kids back then. Now it's the adults. Get back! Even the air passing over Nandini's body is harmful. What happened, Seshagiri? - What happened? - Nandini madam jumped into the well, sir. Dear! Nandini! What made you jump into a well? What made you so desperate? Dear! Nandini! Get up! Dear! What happened? By the next Pushkara, the village will turn into a graveyard! The moment Sudha transgressed the eight-way seal... the protection guard became powerless. Consequently, in that house in the north... an evil power rose to life. - Evil power? - Evil power in that house? Eyes that witness death are seeking death. Every death taking place here has a connection to that house. Every dead body is burning on the premises of that house. So, Parvathi... Even Nandini wanted to commit suicide in that house. This is definitely that lady's curse. Priest! My daughter is now out of danger, right? I hope this is the end of the curse. It doesn't stop with Nandini. The entire village will turn into a cremation ground. You have spooked us enough. Is there a solution or not? Tell us that. Only the edicts can tell us... if it is a solution or penance. I will get them. Don't worry, Surya. Nandini is recovering. What is the curse about? What happened in that house? Twelve years ago... this village was riddled with a pandemic. Each day would end with a child dying. Even my treatment didn't work against the pandemic. Venkatachalapathi's family settled in the village a few years earlier. But they remained aloof and the villagers were wary of them. There were conjectures against them in the village. Deaths in the village continued. It was as if death was waiting outside every door that had kids. When things go out of hand, God is the only one that comes to our minds. An invisible poison has affected the village. To burn it up, a fire must be ignited. As per the edicts, we must hold a Mrityunjaya Homam. Relieved that the temple Priest would conduct the ritual the next day, the village slept peacefully that night. The same night... as Siddaiah was returning from his farm, he saw Venkatachalapthi with a girl's corpse. When his suspicions grew, he checked, and it was clear that witchcraft was taking place. The news spread like wildfire. Villagers who were already devastated by the countless deaths of their children, broke into a frenzy when they saw them perform occult with a corpse. They tied the couple to a tree and burned them alive. A few days after the incident... Priest! Upon learning that spirits were inhabiting the house, the Priest conducted a peace ritual. The house was permanently locked. After that, no one dared to get into the house. Surya! Are you sure we should go in? We have to look for a solution where the problem first began. Oh, my! Book prints... A torch that's still soaked. Someone was here recently. There is only one way to get out of this. What are these pictures? Surya! No. It's the couple who resorted to Blackmagic. Venkatachalapathy and his wife. - Get a six-foot wooden box ready. - Wooden box? Hey, take care of the box. Go, go, go. Energy is the source of this creation. The soul is also a kind of energy. Atharvana Veda proclaims that this energy can be commanded... through the eyes that hold life for six hours after a person dies, this experiment is my quest to bring a dead person back to life. Employing a tantric form using the human eyes. It makes death inevitable for those who witness death. The experiment in this book and the deaths in the village have a definite connection. By the way, what happened to Venkatachalapathy's son? The person possessed by the evil spirit must be kept in the box and the box shall be placed in the sesame circle on the north of the village. After the first contact of the eclipse, the evil power weakens. At that moment, every person who wishes to be alive... must offer their blood. Before the eclipse ends, if you can cremate the body in the box... the evil power will be annihilated forever. What are you saying? Do you want to sacrifice my daughter? You bless people every day. How can you even think of saying that? Hey! It probably skipped your mind. It is not unusual for us to impulsively burn up people for protecting ourselves. That's how we survived earlier. It happens to be your daughter now. That's all. Abbairaju! I only stopped your daughter's wedding for the sake of traditions. But this is my daughter's life. Please don't come in my way, Abbairaju. - What do you mean? - Sir! Hey! Is anyone bold enough to confront death? - No, sir. - No, sir. Hey! Are you so cocky that you defy the Chief's order and trust this guy? How dare you say that? Hey! Are you so cocky that you defy Abbairaju? - How dare you say that? You... - Hey, stop! - Hey, stop! - Hey, hey! - Hey, hey! - Stop it, man! Hey, Abbairaju! It's my daughter. Please ask them to stop! Hey, Abbairaju! I beg you! Hey, someone stop him! Hey, hey! Stop it! Anyone who is afraid of death... whoever it is... if you even lay a finger upon Nandini, I will kill you myself. I am giving Nandini a sedative. She won't wake up for the next eight hours for sure. Before that... I... I will find a solution to this problem. When we already have a solution in hand, if you say, "I gave her a sedative. I used the spell..." Why should we even believe you? Why should we listen to you? You must! He is the man you must listen to, Abbairaju. Because he is the one who explained what is going on here. He is the one who averted a death. We have no option but to trust him! I give you my word. Including Nandini, I will save this entire village. Priest! I need to cross the village boundary. - Cross the boundary?! - What if something happens? Look, son. A girl stepped out of the village and they are blaming all this predicament on her. You want to cross the border now! The harm from breaking the eight-way seal is already done. Now, Surya is going to confront the evil power. It's dangerous for him. In order to save Nandini, if I have to fight with an evil power, I will do it. And I will certainly come back with a solution. Surya! I can repose my faith in you only till the lunar eclipse begins. You only have eight hours at your disposal. Are you going to look for Venakatachalapathy's son? If your hunch is right and he is behind all this, it is very dangerous to confront him. I am going so I can overcome this very danger. Until I return, Nandini is your responsibility. We live in a village that shut down the temple for the sake of customs. They won't think twice about a girl's life. Nandini has already lost ten minutes of her life. Hey! Come on! Let's stop him! Hey, Janardhana! What's the issue? Stop right there! You can't cross the border! Who the heck are you to order us to not cross our border? Aghora told us that your village is struck by a pandemic. If you cross the boundary now, it will spread to our village. If death should be confined to your village, you must not step out until the temple reopens. That's all! They have surrounded the village on all four sides, sir. Hey, we must stop him by hook or crook! Come on! Hey, come on! Catch him by hook or crook. Hey! Stop! Hey! Come on! Hey! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Sathya's dead. Is anyone here? Who are you, son? Why did you come at this hour? I need details of the orphans here. This used to be an orphanage seven years ago. Not anymore. No one lives here other than me and my boss's family. Where is your boss? Is he from Rudravanam?! Bhairava... Bhairava... Why is the power gone now? Hey, get a lantern. Both of you go home. Why? What about you? I will come when she wakes up. Go ahead. Take care of yourself. Here. Keep her hand up. Exactly 12 years ago, the Chief of Rudravanam brought a boy and left him in this orphanage. He was not like the other children. He never mingled with the others. He wouldn't utter a single word other than the mantras. He was always drawing something. He would sit alone under a tree and play with the crows. He wouldn't stay in the hermitage at night. We had no clue where he went. There is a forest behind the hermitage. - He would stand there swaying in frenzy. - Bhairava? What are you doing here? Whenever we questioned him, he would walk away in silence. Back then, we didn't understand why the other children were afraid of him. - Hit him! - Yes. He was 15 years old at that time. One full moon day, one of the hermitage's maids saw him walk half-naked to the forest. Our biggest blunder was to wait for him. - Hey, did you see him? - No, sir! Go that way and check. Hey! Stop! What are you doing in the middle of the night? Where did you go? You... Sir, sir! Hey! Hey! He is running away. Catch him! God knows what spell he used. My boss lay bedridden with paralysis from that day on. It's been seven years since this incident happened. He never came back. Was there any clue about Bhairava's whereabouts later? Move. Move! Poor Nandini! She will be placed inside the box. Which way did the maid see Bhairava go in the forest? Towards the west. What time did he leave and return every full moon day? He would leave at ten after everyone slept, and come back by four in the morning. If he could finish his job and come back on foot in six hours, that means we might find him if we look in that direction. Who is Bhairava? Lord Shiva. Bhairava! A gaze is more powerful than sanctified ash! We can't construe the enemy's workings! It isn't enough to stall him! We must kill him! Which one of you is Bhairava? Digambara! He is not an enemy. He is a refugee. He seeks our help. If you could come here crossing Rudravanam, I am sure you know what happened there. Whoever witnesses a death first, is committing suicide. Instigation of the beast occult! A science that was used hundreds of years ago for ethnic cleansing. If he has used a science so cryptic from Atharvana Veda, he is out to uproot the village. To execute the experiment written in the book... it should be from a place where there's no wind. A place where the incantation cannot be heard. A place where no light can enter! Where can we find such a place? Beast comportment occult is highly vicious. The smallest mistake can be fatal. That is why every minute move that is planned... is recorded in the form of a picture or a potion. Swami! This is where the beast occult was initiated. I saw the same symbol in Bhairava's dad, Venkatachapalathi's book. Bhairava is definitely around. Bhairava! A blockade! The book of edicts followed by the village looks similar to this. Mother Modamamaba! This is the original book of the edicts! Nandini has opened her eyes. Dear! Nandini! - Dear! Nandini! - Nandini! - Dear! Nothing will happen to you. - Nandini! You will be fine! Dear Nandini... She is not completely conscious yet. So, Bhairava used the edicts to take revenge on the village. He made a counterfeit edict and made the villagers believe it. He caused the eight-side blockade and closed the village down. We have already lost many lives. We better go ahead with whatever that has to be done. Hey! Do you want us to voluntarily offer our lives? Hey! I challenge you! One step ahead and I will kill you on the spot. Come ahead if you dare! Come! Sir! There is no other way. If we want the village to survive, this affliction must be burned down. Stop! He promised to save the village along with Nandini. I didn't trust him then. The Priest warned him that he would meet with death if he confronted the evil power. Yet, he stepped out of the village. We wanted to kill so we could live. But he was ready to die to help her live. Not that I trust him even now. But I believe in his love. He will definitely come back for his love. Until then... Calm down and sit quietly. Unless we find Bhairava's whereabouts, we can't stop the carnage that's ensuing. IDENTITY CARD V. BHAIRAVA KUMAR Kumar, sir. Do you like me or not? Swami, the Bhairava we are looking for and Kumar, the first victim of this experiment... are the same person. This isn't death. This is self-immolation. Self-Immolation? What does it mean? To kill oneself willingly and transfer the soul into a chosen being and accomplish the task through them. But... to cross the eight-way blockade set up by the divine power... how did Bhairava's soul even enter the village? How? He pretended to be in love with Sudha and made her cross the blockade. After killing himself before Sudha at the railway station, he entered her body. He passed through the eight-way seal and entered the village. From that moment on, the beast occult started taking effect. Bhairava's soul then sets foot in the village, finds the first witness of death, enters their body through their eyes... and then forces them to kill themselves. To kill the entire village in one go is the final stage of the beast occult. At the first contact of the eclipse, the evil power weakens temporarily. At that exact moment, everyone who wants to live must offer their blood. So, burning Nandini alive was not the solution for protecting the village. It was a part of the experiment to kill the entire village. How did Bhairava get his hands on this book? It means someone in the village co-operated with Bhairava. Not just co-operated, Surya. They, in fact, command him. Bhairava became a spirit after his self-immolation. A spirit has its own energy. Whoever is controlling this energy is right inside the village. He is the one who is actually enforcing the beast occult on the village. Get the edicts here. It is written in the edicts. There is no time, Surya. The process that begins with self-sacrifice will end in the same way. We must find the person employing it and kill him before he kills himself. The shadow has appeared. The eclipse is going to end. Even if Surya comes back now, it will be of no use. The edicts must be adhered to. - Go ahead. - Get up! Hey, hey! - Please, wait. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Please, wait. - My daughter has helped you a lot. - Move aside! Have you forgotten about it? - Take her away. - Please, wait. Please wait! - Lift it. - Hold it. Sir, sir! - Take her away. - Move! - Take her away. - Sir! Sir, Nandini... Nandini! Nandini! No father can watch his daughter die. Let's go! When the Aghora with occult powers surrounds you, they make you so powerless you can't even chant a mantra. How did your body, without any initiation, tolerate the tantric energy? If it is merely your strong resolve... then you are the only savior! Draw a circle with sesame and place the box inside it. Everyone, please offer your blood. Your life is a maze In this darkness How would the truth be exposed And how would you lose your problems? Your doubt even stops The sun's rays from coming in How can light fall on you And how would the deaths stop? You are hell-bent on your quarrels And have forgotten humanity The right person would go against you With all his might only for your good With all his might Swami! Swami, I hope you are okay! The eclipse has begun. The temple must be opened. Hey! He should not step into the village again. Kill him! Hey! Hey! What is this crisis at this hour? They can only stop me. Not you. You must save Nandini and the village under all circumstances. Hey! Please go ahead, Swami! Hey! Surround him! Hey! It isn't my intention to kill, it is only to help everyone live. Hey! Hear me out! Witchcraft is being administered in my village. I only came over to stop it! That's how you passed on the tribulation to us. Now you are causing deaths. Death for death! Hey! Hey! The right person would go against you With all his might only for your good Hey! I didn't come here to die. I came to save that village. Some evil plan has closed Everyone's eyes today No one knows that this is just an illusion Your ears won't listen To the truth right now The disaster will not leave now You are hell-bent on your quarrels And have forgotten humanity Hey! Don't you understand? You are hell-bent on your quarrels And have forgotten humanity The right person would go against you With all his might only for your good Hey, catch him! Catch him! This fight is To end the trail of blood This burning power is out To solve your problems Hey! You are not just burning Nandini, but the entire village! You thought the edicts were infallible. But you didn't realize that those very edicts were replaced. Here! This is the original edict. Everyone present here offered their blood... and is now under the spell of the evil power. Wait, Surya! This is an impending inferno. One step into the ring of fire, and you will be reduced to ashes. This is a tantra that is beyond my power. I cannot win. But I can stall Bhairava's spirit for a while. Find him in the meantime, Surya! It was your eye that saw the predicament of this village. It was your eye that looked for reasons and found the root cause. Pursue! You are the Virupaksha who can save Rudravanam! If everyone is in the clutches of death, who is commanding this killing? Harischandra Prasad! Harischandra Prasad! Harischandra Prasad! Harischandra Prasad! Harischandra Prasad! Harischandra Prasad! KIDS PERISH SUFFERING FROM CHOLERA Dear Nandini! Son! Please save... Please save my daughter. Who was the fourth member of Venkatachalapathi's family? Actually... it is... Answer me! Why did you hide the truth that there is a fourth member? After learning that the spirits were inhabiting the house... Rituals were being conducted for peace. We heard some weird sounds from inside. To know what it was, we went in. Did they also have a daughter? Hey, Kittayya! Take her away from the back without anyone noticing. I was scared that they might harm her if they knew where she came from. So, I raised her like my own daughter. But today, they are sacrificing her to save this village. Please save Nandini, son. It's not Nandini that needs saving. But it's the village that needs to be saved from Nandini! Deaths in this village were set off by the boy you admitted to the orphanage... Venkatachalapathy's son, Bhairava! The one who replaced the edicts of the temple in order to destroy this village... is none other than... Venakatachalapathy's daughter, who you have raised as your own, Nandini! Hey! Nandini! Hey! Nandini! Nandini! You are making a mistake, Nandini. You are making a mistake. Twelve years ago, it was the village that made a blunder. What the village did to save their lives was not wrong! It was your father, Venkatachalapathy, who was at fault. Don't talk about my father when you know nothing about him. What are you saying, Surya? Dad... Even though my mom was bedridden with paralysis, he became a father. Even after the doctors categorically said she won't recover, my father kept trying all the medicines that were available in nature. Hey! What is this? What happened? Calm down, Shanti. My father didn't believe in the medicine that gave no hope for my mom's mobility. He believed in the Veda that could make her move. Through Atharvana Veda, he learned how to control his powers and became an expert in it. He mastered all the occult sciences that were detailed there... and invented a miracle. What is this? This is tantric equipment. Along with occult powers, it also attracts evil powers. This is a talisman that will save you from the harm of such evil powers. Yesterday you said that you will give me a dead body today. The doctor is a genius. The patient had almost died but survived. - Listen. - Yeah. Hey, put this orphan's corpse in the mortuary. Leave now. It's difficult to find a body. There's an experiment in the tantric science of Atharvana Veda that can command power. After a person dies, there is life in the organs for a few hours. If we can send the spirit into the body before that life dies, the lifeless corpse will resurrect. The eyes are the most important of all organs. They are the most significant organ. Using the eyes as a medium, if the life force in you can be transferred to the body that just died, the body will come back to life, just like you. Suspecting that he was using the corpse for black magic, they dragged both of them out, tied them to a tree, and burnt them alive. When I woke up, both my parents had turned into ashes right under the tree. Eight days... I stayed in that house, sick, hungry, and crying. The brother I was waiting for, never returned. Take her away from the back without anyone noticing. Harischandra Prasad took care of me. I grew up among the lunatics who killed my parents. I never saw an ounce of remorse in them. When I realized that there would be no remorse whatsoever, I went to my house to collect memorabilia. We will kill them. Let's kill the whole village. I learned the tantric skills my father invented... and used them to destroy the village. WARDING OFF EVIL: 1. FIRST IDENTIFY THE HOST We started our plan by changing the book of edicts which the village believes in. My house, which was revered like a temple... for helping my mother survive... was turned into a grave by this village. That's why I am turning this village into a graveyard! Your dad's experiment was not aimed at killing but at saving lives. If you don't understand it yourself, how would the village understand? Back then, they made a mistake out of ignorance. Now you're intentionally making an even bigger mistake. Why did Parvathi and Sudha have to die? They were in no way connected to this? Most of them didn't even know your parents. Why should they die? They must! Why are they all here now? To kill me so that they will live. Don't you see? They haven't changed at all. Back then, they all came together and killed two people. Now the two of us are going to kill the entire village! But now I stand between the village and the two of you. Kill me first! You have nothing to do with this village or my vengeance. Go away from here. Go away! You can't kill me. And that's because you love me. You are answerable to your love. It was you who fell in love. Not me. That's a lie. You are in love with me. No, I am not. Hey, you are in love with me! No, no, no! If this is with you, it is equivalent to me being with you. How did your body, without any initiation, tolerate the tantric energy? This is proof of the love that you didn't respond to. Your dad tried to keep your mother alive by using this. You protecting me is also love. Even if there is love in my heart, I would rather die in vengeance than survive for your love. With my self-immolation, this village will go down in the fire! Hey! Stop it, Nandini! You don't love me. Is that it? Nandini! Surya! Surya! Surya, why did you do this? Do you realize what you have done? This village gave me eight hours because I wanted to save my Nandini. Die... I won't let them die. Forgive them, Nandini. It's not your death that will save the village. My vengeance must die first. Can you go beyond this love... and decimate the hatred in me? You... You... You must live, Surya. Forgive me, Nandini. Forgive me. I made a mistake. Will you listen to me? Yes. Nandini! Nandini! Nandini! Nandini! It's not one man's mistake! The entire village was foolish. If you want to avoid another mistake, turn this house, which became a graveyard, into a school. Pass on the knowledge to future generations.
