Could we have the sauce, please? Pat told me there were some jobs going... at the new market? We took three buses today. - Jay could come... - No. - Your mother just wants to... - I know what she wants. This is bullshit! Tell me you know that. So whatever you think happens next, you are wrong, I promise you that. I couldn't stop it. He lost his nerve, that's all. Don't make that call, not yet. I'll try and keep the deal on the table. Give him a few days. Took the long way, did he? Taxi. I told him. Just like you said. He needs to hear it from you. But you said you would... - You said you'd smooth every... - Shh. Charles. Get your fucking coat. You said somewhere public. You know you two can't be seen together. Look, just tell him what you told me. And everything will be like it was. Promise me? I'm standing right here. Mr. McKray. I'm very sorry about... Everything. I didn't know what... It's over, all of it. He gave you the money? No. I thought, I thought... I told them it was a mistake. Just a stupid mistake. I just want it to be over. It's over. What the fuck you doing? It's dark, come on! Wait. Tell Leipzig I'm ready. Put us on the schedule. This week. Yes, it's taken care of. Good morning. Right. Right, I want everything on my desk in half an hour. Right, sign here. Sure there's nothing you wish to add? Died at the scene prior to arrival of the medical team. Summary examination reports, 18 to 25 knife wounds. Jesus wept. Death caused by loss of blood, internal hemorrhaging, shock, et cetera, et cetera. Well, isn't this a monumental fuck up? I warned Miller this could happen. Not like this. Not so soon. Where the hell is he? On his way. Ray, I need more time. Tom McKray is the key. If we let this end here, it'll be two years before we get anything on him. (Anything, Ra)!" The mistake you made, we all made, was pinning this on one accountant. Now so full of holes you could drain pasta. We all know who killed him. All right. All we need to do is prove it. Prove what? McKray did Miller. You were watching him. He took a taxi and went home, locked his doors. He was there when I left. Left? Begging your pardon, ma'am, but my shift ended two hours before that. And now my informant is dead. Enough, Christ! What I want to know is what on Earth was Charles Miller doing in the Bilton in the middle of the night? He wasn't there to admire the lovely gardens. - It's a good point. - McKray hired him to handle large amounts of cash. Miller figured out where the money came from, panicked, came to us. So he said. Wrap it up, unless there's something I'm missing. Actually, um... it may be nothing. The girl who made the call last night, found Miller in an alley behind a building. - Girl? - Found the body when she came home. Signed a statement, it all checks out. Dead when she found him? She's a witness for God's sake! Christ, she's a bloody suspect! Tell me you still have her. She didn't kill your witness, Anne. Single mother, 17 years old, looks like she's 12. Had to have been my daughter's age when she had the kid. Estranged parent, social services, the usual stuff. Her wee boy's handicapped, deaf and mute since birth. She's a little strange, but she's not connected to McKray or Miller. They're squatting in a flat on the south side of the estate. Most of the units on that side were cleared last year. Most? A couple of junky suites, no help there, of course. And an old shut-in across the hall. William Goodwin, 74 years old, claims he didn't see anything. The rest are locked and empty. Probably why they did Miller there. What did she see? Just a body. She signed a statement, it all checks out. What about the kid? He was upstairs, and given who Miller was, and the circumstances... The kid was upstairs? The second floor. - Druggie? - Nah, or she hides it well. Okay, call me at the end of the day. If the girl's not a witness and she didn't stab Charles Miller to death, shut the fucking door before the press come in. Understand? I want her statement and an address. And Detective Ross? When I ask you to watch someone, the least I expect you to do is call it in before you get bored and go home. And a 9:30 meeting means 9:30, not ten minutes after. Perfect. You want me to wait sweetheart? Definitely. What do you want? My name's Anne Ramsay, I'm with the procurator fiscal. Hello? What do you want? I wanted to speak with you about the statement you made last night. Anne Ramsay. Miss Corrie? Isla. (50"')! - He's just a nosy old man. Quite a collection. DL's book exchange. They're cheap. - Tea? - Thank you. You have a son? And he is? Jay. His age? Four. Is that... do you need that? I have terrible memory. And even worse handwriting. Does it bother you? You're 17. You look a lot younger. - How old were you when... - 13. And this is a council flat? My Qralfs. It's getting demolished next year. We're waiting on our own place. Does the council know you're here? Last night, you called the ambulance. From in here or, or from a mobile phone? A mobile. And he was on the ground when you arrived? Hello. Who might you be? Jay. Hello, Jay. He was already... He was dead when you arrived? I think so. I saw the pictures. Jay must have been upset. He didn't see. I sent him upstairs. When you called the ambulance? He unlocked the door himself? I brought him, told him to wait in his room. Then you called the ambulance? You came upstairs, unlocked the door, sent Jay to his room while a man lay bleeding to death? Yes. Then you went back outside? - Yes. - Then you called the ambulance. Not on your way up four flights of stairs or on your way back down. But you waited until you were back outside. I didn't do anything. Was he alive when you found him? I don't know. You told the operator he's bleeding a lot. Dead men don't bleed, Isla. Blood settles, stops. Did he say anything to you before he died? No. You're certain? We need to go, I need to... Did you see who killed him? - No. - Did you see? - No. - Saw nothing? And Jay? May I see his room? Why? Why not? Jay was in here when you called? Yes. You taught him yourself? That's impressive. I thought I got it all. He dropped his milk. You didn't see it. Jay didn't see it, and the victim was already dead when you got home. According to the bus driver, he would've dropped you off at least half an hour before you phoned the ambulance. The bus stop is right over there. Do you see my problem? Do I have to do everything my fucking self? She's not playing the game. She's not having it. Hmm. I can't. I can't, Tom, please. Not in the house, please. - I can get you some... - Get? Get? What the fuck can you get? Where's your man? Where is your fucking husband? - In the jail. - In the jail. So who's going to pay me? - Him? - Please, please, just leave him alone. Make us a cuppa. Go on. That's a good boy. I've had a look upstairs. All shite. Nothing worth having. See, I have this problem, sweetheart. Your husband and his pals fucked up this simple job, and got nicked. And now all my trucks... all my fucking trucks... are lying in my yard. Will you put the fucking kettle on? See when you owe me and I ask you to do something, you fucking do it. Or else your husband is going to wake up with a shiv in his ear. I'm doing some business, what is it? They're supposed to be empty. Look, I'm not the fucking landlord. I'll be there. You filled it up too much. Pass me a cup. No, no. That one. Fill it up. Fill it up. Fill it. Not full. When I ask you to do something, and I'm owed, you fucking do it, yes? Yes. Was that difficult? Evening all. Don't remember giving you a set of keys. Spoke to my contact. Delivery, day after tomorrow. It's a lot, you're going to need more places to hold it. Don't worry, I've got a few, and I'll keep moving it until you make the deals. You do remember the fucking deals, Mr. Ross? Deals will be done, Tom. Buyers are desperate, might even up the price. So what's the fucking point of holding it? Because, Tom, I have a supply so I create demand. We just need to be twice as careful. One cunt opens one bag. Then what? They're going _ to grass you up? Anything gets found that's their fucking problem. There's a reason they can't figure this shit out, yeah? Aye. So what happened at the flats? What happened is you could have fucked us, that's what. Those flats weren't empty. Bullshit, they're getting torn down. They all got emptied. Aye, who'd you think found your handiwork after you were gone? No, the place was dark. I got lazy, I should have taken care of it myself anyway. Who was it? - What? - Who found the body? Just some girl, junkie. Don't worry about it. Fuck it, I'll send Jeezo. - We'll start a fire or something. - More bodies? Tom, the last fucking thing we need right now is more bodies. More attention. Get the picture? I'll handle it. After the package is sold, she's fair game. Morning, Ross. Busy I see. - What's this? - A rare appearance by Detective Ross? Are we feeling okay? Nothing a stiff drink wouldn't cure. Any news on Miller? The usual. Six months of bullshit going nowhere. By the way, prosecutor brought that girl back in, first thing this morning. Have a seat. Thank you for coming in so early. We've been waiting for hours. Yes, lots of paperwork. Do you want a cup of tea? I've had three. I might need to pee. I have some questions. Fill in some blanks. What's that? Everything there is to know about Isla and Jay Corrie. Am I a sus... A suspect? No, not yet. Let's start with Jay. Shein? Booked till three. Something urgent? Who's she talking to? What's your name? He's deaf, doesn't talk. I'm thinking of marrying him. I'll call later. The father? Jay is a dependent. If the father won't contribute... I sent a picture. It's just us. Isla don't you.. Just us. Social services tell me your parents have offered to help. They offered to take him. They have a spare room. Why not take it? There's no room for me. Do you see your parents, ever? Once a month, as agreed. And if you didn't see them for a while? A long while? Your story about that night isn't working. There are holes. I'll need you to come back and see me in a few days. Once I've had time to examine all the facts... perhaps you and I can find a way to help each other. I'm sorry, Annie, it doesn't work that way. I'm serious, why, why not? I mean, what do they care if we give it to some crooked accountant or a single mother and her child? If your theory goes tits up and Tom McKray doesn't talk, this whole affair is going to look like an unforgivable waste of public money. Miller was killed less than two hours after leaving chambers. If they think there's another witness. I get the picture. We have a couple of days, a week at the most. Will she talk? If I have something to offer. Look at this. Jet black before I hired you. Elvis fucking Presley. I'll make the call. Don't make me regret it. One thing I know for sure is that Isla is a lot smarter than people give her credit for, and I don't believe this decision is in her best interest. It's ten o'clock. Yes. The letter said the review was at ten o'clock. We decided to start a little early, just to go over a few details of your situation. Without me. That's correct. - Now, I'd like to discuss... - No, it is not correct. Any meeting concerning an individual or dependent is to be held in the presence of their parent or guardian unless they're not available, not capable, or refuse to attend. You read the leaflets, I see. All of them. If you had read them a little more carefully, you'll remember that a representative may also attend on your behalf. They are not my representatives. We can discuss this later, Miss Corrie. Today we're here to talk about little Jay. - Where is he now? - Why didn't you tell me about this? You could have told me when I was at the house. Why didn't you say anything? He's with the daycare, just upstairs. Ahmed tells me you refused all attempts to remedy your situation. -For that reason, we've decided... -We. We who? The people in this room, Isla. Just listen and we'll get through this without... The people in this room are in no position to decide anything, Mrs. Garran, and you know that. As a matter of fact... -You also know that it's not in your authority to discuss my situation or little Jay with anyone not directly involved. You little shit. I'm almost 18. I'm his mother and I decide what or where is best for my son. Isla, your parents are offering Jay a safe home. A good home, a real chance for you to get back on your feet. They're not offering me anything. - Are you? - And how do you plan to support yourself? You're staying in your grandmother's flat, a condemned property. Every day you put yourself and your son's life in danger. You had Jay when you were 13 years old, and these things happen, but every decision that you've made since, running away from home, living in these conditions, I'm not convinced that you've matured enough to take care of yourself or Jay. It's not permanent, Isla. - It's just until... - It's already been decided. I know my rights. You want to take my son, go to court. With a court, Jay could be sent to a foster home. This way, at least, he can be near you with your parents. And he'd be safe there, like I was safe? Don't. "Don't" didn't work for me. What are you suggesting, Isla? There's a reason they won't go to court. I'll speak to him. You promised, you swore. Take my son, I will fight you. Give him to them and... We're only trying to help, Isla. Without this arrangement I don't see how you can continue to support yourself. Where were you when I needed help? You don't need to concern yourself with her. James. That wasn't really fair. After what happened? - After... - I meant for you. What is it you're not telling us? You can't hate them forever, Isla. Why not? Take the third option if it's offered. But make sure there's a nominal sentence on the table before he goes home. This isn't a free roll. Papers from last week's sessions. Sign them all this time, please, and Detective Ross is waiting. Show him in. He was here yesterday too. You promised he wouldn't leave your sight. I did, aye. Moved at last, I see. I thought they might have pressured him, scared him maybe. But not... not so quickly. Why didn't you just take the fucking deal? An allowance, and a house in the country. I'd kill for that right now. I fucked up. It won't happen again. I need a favor. The witness. The girl in the flats? McKray knows where the money's going, and where it's coming from. He's still the key. And if he killed Miller himself we could crack him wide open. Still looking for your mystery guest. Someone's playing a smarter game. This girl, maybe she saw something, maybe she didn't. Don't rush it, take your time with it. Time? Once McKray figures out there's a fresh witness, it's over. Time's what we don't have. Then move her now. Not yet. You want to pressure her. Offer her a way out once she feels their hands on her neck. Something like that. That's cruel, don't you think? It's necessary, don't you think? Aye, you're your daddy's girl, that's for sure. And he would be proud of you. Go see her. You, not Carl. He's not the sharpest tool and he drinks like a girl. I need a few more days to cut through the red tape. Quietly. Mom's the word. - Yes? - We're sending someone to observe the transaction. Is that necessary? Given recent circumstances, yes. Where? The usual place. Welcome to Glasgow. Yeah, a shit hole. Get on with it. I want to get on the first train back to civilization. Happy? The money? Oh, it's coming. So is Christmas, where's the fucking money? Get in the fucking car. Aye. What the hell is going on? Keep calm. We should go. We wait. You're just not paying me enough, I... The money is in the hotel. And, uh, next time, try not to be such an English cunt. Go. Hotel. Who's the patsy? Just an actor with a gambling problem. Useful, disposable. You happy? We don't like amateurs, Brian. You need better people. After this amount of time, we believe it's in our best interest to keep the funds allocated as previously discussed. For this location in the north? Yes. A new source, a different witness? Yes. What do they have? Possibly? Everything. She might have seen who killed our informant. Might have seen. So she hasn't made a statement? Why would she? We need to fully assess what the subject has to offer. Or whether there's genuine danger. Charles Miller lived in Bearsden. That's the other side of the world from the Bilton Estate. How long do you think a witness will last living next to these people? You're targeting others than Thomas McKray? Someone has been in charge long before McKray. The crux of the matter is the Bilton situation does not have to die with Charles Miller. But it will with this young lady. And her son. - A son? - Four years old. Pretty sure he saw everything. But not certain? We don't know. But neither do they. And let's not kid ourselves. There's only one way they can know for sure. Ray. - Okay. - They agreed? Annie, the deal is back on the table. I'll put it to her tomorrow. Do it today, put her in a hotel... But right now she might be safer on the estate than in protective custody. Who else knows? Just Brian Ross. Is that wise? Him we can trust. Yeah, that much I'm certain. - Isla Corrie? - What do you want? Anne Ramsay asked me to check on you, make sure everything's okay. We're fine. I'm a police officer. It's late. Can I come in? There are some details we need to go over, perhaps we can sit. Hello. He's deaf. Now I remember. I met him at Miss Ramsay's office yesterday. No lights? Candles are cheaper. Wouldn't have thought that. Must be difficult, so young, raising a wee boy with problems, handicapped. We get by. Detective McKay's report said you found Mr. Miller dead and called the ambulance. He was dead when you found him? Didn't see anything? No. And you saw nothing before that? [Nq_ ichuckfing] Nothing at all? Oh. Don't do that. It's unlucky to pick up a knife. Somebody else has to do it for you. Christ, my mother would leave one lying on the floor for days until someone came to the house. I've got a problem. I think you can help me. See, I don't think Mr. Miller was dead when you found him. I think he was still breathing, maybe still talking. I.. I think you saw something, that's why you left your son, went downstairs, then called the ambulance. But you got close to him, why would you do that? Doesn't matter, even if your story is true, certain people can't afford to take that chance. That type of person wouldn't think twice, you, your wee boy. - Miss Ramsay said... - You're talking to me. Tomorrow Miss Ramsay is going to make you an offer. In return, she wants you to tell her everything. But maybe there's some details she doesn't need to know. So maybe we can help each other. All she needs to know is who killed him. - That's all. - Yes. Whatever he said... whatever else you saw, all she needs to know is what calmed that. - Yes? - Yes. I could just let them paint the walls in here. With you, your wee boy. I don't need to do it like this. You hear from Miss Ramsay... have any problems, call me. Speak only to me, don't leave a fucking message. Walk me to the door. Appreciate your help. Remember, call me. Yeah? I'm moving everything forward. I thought we were going to wait, drive the price up? No, I've spoken with the buyers. Collect the bags and meet me tomorrow. What about the girl? Worthless, didn't see a thing. You speak to her? No, no need, just do your job. Leave her alone or you'll fuck everything up. We wouldn't want that. Tired? What is it? It's just, uh... The girl in the flats? He said he would take care of it. He's police, right? I can't, it's just best you don't know. Okay. But he is. Clever cunt. You're the only one knows him. Anything happens to you he's free and clear. He was there too, the police? But you were the one that did the dirty work. That makes it your problem, no? A girl and a wee boy, alone. Who knows? It's, it's not that easy. All I'm saying... things happen I'll go. I'm sorry about the way you were treated. Michelle can be, you know. It's not going to be easy. Your parents are determined. They say they only want what's best for Jay. For Jay? For everyone. And I'm not everyone? Tell me how I can help. You've already done enough. Social services have appealed to the court for an immediate hearing. It's in three days, Isla. Three days. Jay will not be sent back here. The court will either assign your parents as guardians or... a foster home. Look... I've spoken to the housing committee. There are places close to the school, but it might not be available for months, maybe more. Months. It's not as long as it sounds. It's a lifetime for a little boy. I've got this. 19 pounds, two pence. If you could talk about it, perhaps I could do more. What's done is done. We'll find our way. Wait. Hold to forgiveness, Isla. She is your daughter. I heard she was seeing someone. Try calling some time. Denial isn't just a river in Egypt, Brian. Christ, you should have been the lawyer, probably be my boss by now. Aye, in another life. Dad always said your talents were wasted on the force. I called twice. She'll call when she's ready. How's surveillance on McKray? Terrible. Slippery little prick. I don't understand it. How can you just kill a person like that, like, like it's nothing? I have this friend. Vegan. Told me something once that, at the time, couldn't quite get my head around. She said that some vegans won't eat a fig. A fig? Aye, a fig. Apparently, in order for a fig to grow, a wasp has to climb inside the flower and die. So desperate to get in, that it breaks off its own wings in the process, then gets digested by the plant, and this is what then becomes a fig. So, because something has to die for this to exist, some vegans, won't eat a fucking fig. You've lost me. I'm not done. I read an article a few years back, about an experiment with vegetarians, life-long veggies, not even a fish finger. These scientists serve them up steaks, big, bloody, bone sticking out one end. Most couldn't even look at it. A few tried but probably stopped before they could take the first bite. But one or two, they didn't mind it so much, maybe even liked it. It's not the same thing. It's exactly the same thing. Those veggies never had to eat anything that didn't grow in the ground or fall from a tree. Nothing that had a pulse or a face. To them, meat is murder. But sometimes... we have to make choices, live our lives that people couldn't possibly understand. But to us... it's just... what's for dinner. I'm ready to move on the girl. You certain? Someone's pulling the strings. If we get McKray. Without her, we're dead in the water. I'll handle it. What are you, the fucking queen? Up front. How long will this take? You understand what I want? Say it. I was in the flat. I saw a man walk over, then the other man spoke to him and he pulled a knife out... from his pocket, I think. How close were they? The other man reached out. Mr. Miller? I think he wanted to shake hands, but he was pulled and the man with the knife, he... - He stabbed him. - How many times? A lot. A lot of times, I, I don't know. You got a clear look at the killer? Yes. And you saw the pictures? You can identify the man with the knife? Yes. And? I can identify him. You understand the arrangement this office has presented you with? That you are required to... Tell Miss Ramsay what she needs to know. You can't protect us. Isla, these things take time. You can't understand how difficult it was to even offer you this. It's not unreasonable to ask for a little faith. Once I tell you... what chance do we have? I appreciate everything you've done for me, for us, but I'm not signing anything. And I'm not saying the name until we're safe. I've just spoken with the relocations officer. In fact, I've just lied to him. - We'll move you tomorrow. - Today. We're not ordering pizza, Isla. Things need to be done. One of these things is that you meet the requirement of this agreement. Not until we're safe. And all that other stuff, I don't understand any of it. If I rewrite it, if I simplify the language and include you into protective custody tomorrow, you'll give me the name? - Yes. - The name that I want? Tomorrow. Final offer. You tell us everything, here and now, everything, and I'll move you tonight. I'll put you in a hotel and I'll pay for it myself. But I need that name on record. I'm sorry. Then I hope to see you tomorrow. Will you give us a moment? I'll go check the wee man. Make sure he's behaving himself. Is there something you want to say? In private? My assistant tells me your name's come up in the court schedule? A family intervention? What would you do in my situation? Whatever it takes. You are playing a dangerous game. What did you tell her when I left the room? I didn't say anything. What did you see? You were staring at us. After it happened. After... NO, no, no, no, no. You saw Tom McKray, no one else. | didn't tell. You saw McKray, say it. McKray. You saw McKray stick him, he was alone, say it. Why are you doing this? Look... do as I tell you, take the deal. Get your wee house in the country and everybody will be happy, even you. I thought she was your friend. Miss Ramsay. Business comes first. She forgets that. Aye. [Brian] We're good, deal's done. The money? It's all here. Meet me in the morning, five o'clock. Your place. I'll be there. Then that's that. - Here! - Get out! [thudding;| Where are you going? Come here! Where the fuck are you going? Get fucking back here. Fuck. I'm going to fucking burn you! Burn you! Bitch! She put up some fucking scrap, man! She got Jeezo right in the fucking balls! I don't even know her fucking name. Please. You saw me do Charlie. You saw me kill Charlie. Fuck! What did he make you say? That cunt cop, what did he make you say? What did he make you say? Come on, man. What did he promise you? Whatdid he promise you? Huh, huh'? What? The kid, the kid, the kid! - The kid, bring the kid! - What kid? The kid, the fucking kid, the cunt of a kid! There's no fucking kid, it was just her! - Fuck! - It was just her. Where is he? Where fucking is he? Social services took him. Liar, liar, liar, liar! - Bring him. - If there was a kid he'd have heard me bouncing off her walls, fucks sake. Make fucking sure! Mimmo's in the back. He's waiting in the van. Join him. Don't fucking move or leave until I call you. What did you tell them? Eh? What did you tell him and his pals? I didn't. What? I didn't. You didn't? You did, you did, you did, you did, you did! I know you did! See, I know how this goes, I know how this goes, I know how this goes. Tom disappears, Tom fucking disappears and lays low. Lays low at the fucking bottom of the Clyde! But he'll be worse! I swear it! See, just about now, Jeezo will be there. The way he drives, he's fucking crazy. And he'll get your boy, and he'll be battering your boy off every fucking wall. He's just a kid. Yeah... but he... He saw it too. He saw it too. Wait. How the fuck? Wait. Thank you. It's not even six. When? Is she okay, do we know... Sorry, say that again, she has what? Yes, I heard you. Well, where is he? Make the call. Bring him in. You saw Tom McKray. - No one else. - I didn't tell. You saw McKray, say it. - McKray. - You saw... Thought she was your friend? Miss Ramsay. Business comes ﬁrst, she forgets that. Why are you... Quite a pickle. Any ideas? Anything? Chief Inspector's upstairs. All the cooks spoiling the broth. This is bullshit, Anne. - It has to be. - I wish. The girl's downstairs, where's Brian? The cells, got him on suicide watch. I'll speak to her first. You should have stayed at the hospital. Tell me what happened. Jay is just down the hall. Tell me. You have the tape? I need to hear it from you. He told me what to say. That Tom McKray... if I didn't... But you didn't. What happened last night? He was angry. Broke everything. I-' Detective Ross? Brian Ross did that to you? Who killed Charles Miller? Approved. Signed by me, my boss, and his boss. All it needs is your signature and a name. You got a minute? Results from the knife. Blood type matches Miller. Fingerprints belong to Ross. DNA will be a few hours, but... This is a nightmare. There's more. We found a knife in Detective Ross's car. His prints on the handle, almost certainly Charles Miller's blood on the blade. They found more than one blood type. Small amount. Trace. What are the chances? I've known Brian Ross my whole life. He was my father's best friend. He's like family, if all of this is true... They tell you Tom McKray is dead? Yes. And others. Violent, ugly. They tell you that? No. Your parents are here with social services. They want us to grant them custody of Jay. They can't. We have a deal. And these are the only copies. I gave you what you wanted. Last night Tom McKray was beaten and shot. We found a club and a gun. Then in Detective Ross's car a knife, fingerprints, blood. It's like we hit the evidence jackpot. His fingerprints on the gun, handle, shell casings, the trigger. All of that, maybe I can figure it out. But a knife? In his own car? See, without the knife, we would never have checked the fingerprints on the gun against a police officer. Maybe Ross killed Miller. Maybe McKray kept the knife for leverage or blackmail. So Ross killed him for it. And we got to him before he could get rid of it and finish the job. Sound about right to you? See, this only works if all the pieces fit. Who killed Charles Miller? Say the damn words! The knife results. Miller's blood, your prints in your car. Annie. I have three murder weapons, four bodies, and one suspect. The killer was Tom McKray. That's not how she tells it. Clever girl. I won't be speaking with you again, Brian. Not directly. After today your court representative will communicate through my office. You will never speak to me again. But understand this. I'm going to unravel all of it. What you are, every awful thing you've done. I'm going to paint the court with every damn detail. Paint me, you'll paint yourself. If it comes to that. One question. My father? No. Thank you. Once in place, you understand that you cannot return or establish contact with anyone unless agreed in advance with the procurator fiscal. If you understand all of these statements and agree, please sign here and initial here, here, and here. Could I have a minute, please? I asked if I could see you before... Your parents are here. I heard. You don't have to do this. Not like this. There are other ways. Not for us. I can help, Isla. You might not be able to come back from this. I know. Whatever happened between you and your father, this isn't the answer. - If you could just... - It's in the past. That's where it should stay. Isla, help me to understand. Is your father... - Did he... - No. No, not like that. It was a friend. I was alone and we, we both... After it happened, once it was too late, he beat me. Started hitting me like he was, like I was someone else. And she defended him. Pregnant at 13. What should I expect? What would the neighbors think? She should have defended me. Defended us. They've made their choice. And I've made mine. ♪ The king has fallen I' ♪ I've seen him go down I' ♪ A well-placed pawn I' ♪ Will be strong on its own ♪ ♪ We're alone ♪ ♪ I've been waiting' ♪ ♪ All I know ♪ ♪ ls worth portraying I' ♪ In the silence I' ♪ You're still breathing I' ♪ All is quiet I' ♪ Please believe me ♪ ♪ On the throne I' ♪ He's cold and killing I' ♪ All I've known I' ♪ I'm still winning I' ♪ Show no mercy ♪ ♪ Stay unbroken A' ♪ One step forward ♪ ♪ I'm getting closer A' ♪ We'll fight I' ♪ Our way back home ♪ ♪ Out of the dark ♪ ♪ We'll be unbroken ♪ ♪ Wind is calling I' ♪ Here are my holes ♪ ♪ We won't be lost ♪ ♪ We're on the right track home ♪ ♪ A deep breath ♪ ♪ Your smile darkens ♪ ♪ Here you can't ♪ ♪ Harm us ♪
