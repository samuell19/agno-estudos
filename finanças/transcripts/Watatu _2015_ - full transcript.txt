Oh. Hello. It's good to get you here. Because I want to tell you a story. The story is about my family and it's not a good story. After telling you this story, I'll give you a chance to tell me what we should have done differently. The story is about my uncle Salim, his best friend, my brother Yusuf, and my hometown of Mombasa. - How are you? - Good. Ah, I got them. Woah! Salim. Salim. You're here, my wife. Grab me a bowl. - Just a minute. - Hurry up, it's starting to leak. Wait. Here. Give it to me. - What's wrong? - Hold on. It's smelly. Did you know that we have new neighbours? Yes, I heard a vehicle park outside. - Yes. - Yes. My brave workman. I told you when you ignore these things they get ugly. What did you just call me? My brave workman. When you call me that my heart is filled with joy. - Stop it. - Come here. Salim. Salim, stop. I got you. Work is stressing me so I don't have time for your jokes. Stress at work? I think I should quit that job. Don't say that. How will we survive if you quit? You know, with all your Mama's food and her imports from Dubai. - Salim. - Am I lying? Am I lying? It's too much. Wanting birthday gifts every day. Well, today is my birthday. What? Today is my birthday. - Okay. Close your eyes. - Huh? Close your eyes. Okay. Okay. Come. I will fall. Relax. Easy. Slowly. What is it? You don't hurry for good things. - Okay. - Okay. Stop. Turn around. Surprise. - A new TV? - Yes. Oh sweet love Oh sweet love Let no one come between us Thank you so much. Happy birthday, my queen. - Thank you. - Talk to me. I've always wanted to have a new TV. Really? I was looking for the right moment to surprise you. Why is it not working? Is there electricity? Yes, there's electricity. This remote is dusty. Why is it not working? Salim? When I bought it, it was working. - Salim? - Yes. Where did you buy this TV? This one? I bought it from Alibaba. The electronics technician. A very smart guy. He has so many things, I even ordered you an oven. So he has so many second-hand things to buy for someone like me? What do you take me for Salim? I have so much stress at work. I want to rest when I come home. And you get me a TV that doesn't work. Is it really fair? What's going on? Mama, it's Salim who got me a TV that isn't working. Where did you buy the TV? I bought it… He bought it from some guy called Alibaba. Doesn't Alibaba repair rubbish? Mama, I don't know what he takes me for. Do I deserve a broken TV as a birthday present? Is it fair? This is between me and you. Must you involve Mama? I'm on your case. I'll discipline him for you. You should learn to be grateful. At least say thank you. Thank you for what? Look at me when I'm talking to you. Don't look at me like a lizard that is jammed in the door. Was my daughter second-hand when I gave her to you? I'm talking to you! No, Mama. Do this… Take this rubbish and take it back to Alibaba. Then walk into a shop like a real man and buy a new TV. Get out! Put that down. What do you do for a living? What kind of question is that? You know I sell chicken. You sell chicken? You don't feel embarrassed to say that to my face? "I sell chicken." - But Mama, I… - But Mama what? Do I have a stupid son like you? Wow! Where was this picture? On top of your clothes shelf. I thought it was lost. Mama. Look at my parent's picture. Oh. You take after your dad. When was this picture taken? 1968 on their wedding day. It was outside their shop where I was raised. We should visit the place to see if it still exists. Okay. Jack. - Yes. - Help me. My password is being rejected for not being strong enough. That means your password is too easy and you need to change it. I made it easy so that I can remember it. Why is it not accepted? Oh, this computer is trying to be smart. I'll show it who's smart. Wait and see. Fine. But Faith and I will be able to guess your password. Ah, Jack, your people broke my plate. Ask them why they broke my plate. Now the laptop is asking for capital letters. Mama, let's finish unpacking. We'll deal with the laptop later. Wait, I must see whether anybody has responded. Responded to what? I joined a new network. I'm looking for new friends. Friends? Aren't you too old for 'friends'? Who is old? Who is old? It's okay for your father to have many women friends but not me. Good. Yeba! I have 146 replies. Jack, come and see. Now… "Dear Mama. Are you ready?" Um… - Jack? - What is it, Mama? - Jack. - Good Lord! Mama, what are you looking at? No, I wasn't looking. I don't know why this man has sent this picture. What did you write? I wrote that I wanted a new friend. What was your user name? "Mama who's ready." Ready? Ready for what? - You should be embarrassed Mama. - Embarrassed about what? Your father has been gone for ten years and I have been alone. You think it's an embarrassment if I start dating? You think I should not trust men after your father betrayed me? Mama, you have to delete… Keep your hands off my computer. You hear me? Don't order me around like a child in my own house. Our house. Wow, Jack. Thank you for bringing us home to Mombasa. I never liked life in Nairobi. The cold, too many people, the traffic. Thank you. I also didn't like Nairobi. It feels good to be home. Go fetch the last box we left downstairs. You still haven't left? I'm leaving now. Hurry up. Okay fine. I'm sorry. Thanks. Jack? Salim? - Jack. - Salim. Ah, Jack. Jack! What are you doing here? - I live here. - What? I'm just moving in. I've been transferred back to Mombasa. - I live here too. - You live here? It's true, mountains don't meet but people do. Unbelievable. We moved here today. I was going to start looking for you tomorrow. Let me look at you. You're getting old. - And you're getting fat, my brother. - Really? Wait. Hadija! Faith! Sweetheart. Faith. Sweetheart, this is Jack. - Nice to meet you. - Jack. Hadija. And this is her mother. Nice to meet you. This is my wife Faith and her mom. - Faith. - How are you, Ma'am? I'm fine. So sweetheart, you realise this is 'Jack'. This is the original Jack. The Jack who saved father. - Oh, the 'hero'. - Hero? What! You never told your family that you are a hero? Don't joke about saving someone from a sinking ferry. Jack never mentioned that. Jack saved my father when the ferry they were on sank in Zanzibar. He kept him afloat for two hours. You were thirteen years old. I don't believe this. We are so blessed. And what brings you back to Mombasa? I've been transferred to Mombasa. I'm here to do community liaison work. I'm a policeman. Ah. That's good. At least we have security. Coffee or tea? Tea. Definitely tea. - Ma'am? - Yes. Where did you say you were from? Oh I was living in Ganjoni before my daughter moved back from Nairobi. Where are you originally from? Oh, I'm from Nairobi. Poor you. Mombasa must be very hot for you. Well, I have been here nearly thirty years. I am used to it now. Yes, but let's face it. Home is always best. And this is home. And it is the best. - I think… - What? Come, Ma, let's go in. - Ma'am. - Yes. Why the frowning face? Frowning face? - Hadija? - Yes. Did I frown? - Come, Mama, let's go. - No. Wait. She is making a face like something is smelling. Why would I make a face? Why would I frown at you and nobody knows you around here? Please don't upset me. I don't want strangers affecting my blood pressure. - Mama. - We're not strangers, we're your neighbours. Neighbours? You are from Nairobi. You people are everywhere. Taking everything. You've taken over all the offices and jobs. Is that fair what you're doing? Enough Ma. Let's go inside. So it's our fault? Huh? It's my fault when you went to school, you didn't learn? - Mama! - No, wait. My fault you don't want to work? Is it our fault? Huh? My fault that you just want to sit listening to Taarab, eating potatoes and gossiping? - Wait, is it our fault? - Have I stopped you from dancing Taarab? And you are shapeless. I never gossip. You don't even know me. Please don't upset me. Listen to me carefully. We are not leaving. Go hang yourself or let your blood pressure kill you! But we are not leaving this place. You don't know me. Stop it, Ma. - Jack. - No, Mama, stop. Ma! - Ma! - Mama, please! Let's leave. Take her inside. Yusuf. Yusuf, what are you doing? What do you want in my room? Get out. Show me what you were reading. This is my room and I need my privacy so get out. You are reading a paper with the Alfajir sign? That's what you're reading? What's wrong with you? Why are you always on my case? Why are you mad? I'm just asking you a question. Huh? Mama is here. Let me call her. Mama. - Ma. - Yes. Come and see what Yusuf is doing. Yusuf. What are you doing? Ask her. There's a paper he's reading. Tell him to show you. What paper? Let me see it. It's nothing, Mama. Just a letter from a girl. Liar. You told me you were studying and now it's a letter from a girl? Yusuf, were you studying or is it a letter from a girl? Show me the letter we finish this case. Mama, I can't betray my girl. Girlfriend? Why haven't you brought my daughter-in-law to meet me? Mama! Focus. There is no girl. Which girl writes a letter with the Alfajir sign? - Alfajir? - Yes, I saw it. I bet his friend Musa gave it to him. - Musa? - Mama. She's lying. I haven't seen Musa for weeks. You're lying. I saw you with Musa the other day at his place. Or wasn't it you? What are you talking about? Musa and politics is like fire and water. Musa is an artist. Yusuf, my son… Please tell me you are being a good boy when you leave the house. Of course I am, Mama. Don't listen to her. She is jealous. Jealous of what? I wonder. Mama, I know you love me. I love you so much. I'm your son, you should trust me. Don't you trust me? I trust you, but I must look out for you. He's lying to you, Mama, and you are buying it. What is wrong with you? Leave me alone and get out. Oh, please. Can't you be like other kids out there that get along? Must you fight all the time? Salma, get out of his room. Didn't you hear? Get out. Come help me with the shopping. Get out! Mama, look at her. Salma, get out of there. I'll beat you. I'll never forget that. You have such a good memory. I have missed you, my friend. - How did we lose each other? - I can't remember how long it's been. Jack. You are a policeman? Community Liaison Officer. Sounds important. It's what interests me. Um… I'm sorry about what happened earlier with my mother-in-law. Things are very hard here and… I know. But… How are you? - I'm fine, Yusuf. - What's up? Who's that? - That's Yusuf. - Yusuf? Yusuf, my sister Nana's son? That is Nana's son? She has two kids now. Oh, you only know Salma. Yes, I only know Salma. Salma is Yusuf's older sister. I must have left when he was young. He's very smart. He's really bright. But very quick-tempered. That makes Nana think that he has joined the Alfajir group. But I don't agree with her. But you know at this age young men have issues so I just keep my distance. You see. - A certified technician. - Huh? - Salim. - What's up? - Hi. - What's up? Rubbish is not working. I hope it's fixed now. Really? - You mean it's working properly now? - Yes. I didn't know you were hanging with policemen these days. You are from the youth group in Changamwe? Yeah, that's me. Wait, you've met before? I met with them earlier. You're a policeman? You're brave coming here. I don't understand what you're doing here. Oh come on, he's ok. Let it go. - He's trying. - Trying to do what? It's okay to arrest suspects who then suddenly 'disappear'. Is that what he's saying? - Stop defending him. - I've never made anyone disappear. He has a point, my friend. How do you expect us to have community relations when we can't trust you? I heard you speak today and what you're doing it's good. But what you're trying to do won't go anywhere unless these killings stop. And unless they start listening, nothing will be accomplished. All our work will be in vain. - That's true. - Yes. - Uncle… - Yusuf. You brought a police here? No, just having tea. There's no problem here. No, there's a problem. Musa, Joseph and I had a discussion. It's time to decide whose side you're on. What side are you on? - I am on the side of justice. - Justice? You're trying to defend the Government? Let me ask you a question. Do you know what's going on in Somalia? You have killed innocent people. We Muslims refuse… - People from the coast. - That's what I said. You said Muslims. I'm a Christian. We Coastarians have been oppressed for too long. Look around. You upcountry people have all the best jobs. And in development, you're given first priority. And as if that's not enough you own all the big hotels. Why can't you leave us alone? What do you want from us? And if that's not enough officer, you've been given good opportunities, good jobs, good pay, while people from the coast have nothing. But I'm a Coastarian. I was born here, I was schooled here. So what? We know everything about you. We know where your family is from. You don't belong here, you're an outsider. Officer, I have a degree and I can't get a job. Do you have a degree? - No... - Exactly. But you have a Job. A job you can't do. Listen. We intend to restore the peace and security in our region even if that means by fighting we have to shed blood. Ah, no. Listen, guys. Time out, boss. One love, guys. You start a fight and we all will be hurt. - Shut up! - What are you saying? Huh? - What are you saying? - I'm sorry. Whose side are you on? I can be anywhere. Ah, you want to appease these people? Their fate will be your fate. Yusuf. Let's go. Move. Yusuf. Relax. Thanks, Salim. You can't defend me? You can't defend me from your nephew and his gang? Leave me alone. Continue being silent. Then you say things can be fixed? How can we fix things when you can't even stand up to your nephew? Please, let's just go. Thank you, my brother. You can't even defend me when I'm being attacked. Your TV is now working. Thank you. Thank you. Keep it up. This is not right. I am as much of a Coastarian as you. - And you let him talk to me that way. - No man, Jack. Don't be mad. You are my brother. I thought I was. You definitely are my brother. But I wouldn't let anyone talk to you like that. What's the difference between your mother-in-law's bigotry this afternoon and tonight? Salim. What's happened here? It never used to be like this. We never used to think like this. Muslim, Christian, coastal, upcountry people. It's terrible. It's scary, Salim. You need to talk to your nephew. See you later. Jack! Jack! Jack. Mama, those are our neighbours. What kind of neighbours are they, just wanting to fight? It's not good Ma. What is not good? Those are foreigners. - You are embarrassing me. - I'm not. I want us to move from this house. I do not agree with you, Mama. You have no choice. I am your birth mother, and I said so. Hello? Morning sister. - Are you awake? - Of course. Don't lie to me. You're still in bed. I can hear it in your voice. It's my day off. Let me rest. It's after eight. I need you here. I need you to come now. What is it? Is it about Yusuf? Yes, it's about him. Please come round so we can talk. I gave birth to you, and I give you no choice. - Salim. - Yes Mama. Go to the market and get me some make-up. And don't forget my prescription. - Okay, Ma. - Okay. I see all is well. We trust in God. Because I… Yusuf. Nephew. Hey, I'm calling you can't hear me? Sorry, I'm rushing somewhere. Yusuf? I know you are mad at me because of yesterday. But remember, Jack is my brother. He is my friend. We must live like friends here. Befriend the enemy? - I… - Listen Uncle… Why pretend things are okay when they are not? They have taken everything. We are left with nothing. Only one friend of mine from the university has a job. The rest of us wasted our time. Yusuf, education is never a waste of time. You're wrong. I wish I had learnt how to fight. Why fight and with who? Look at yourself. Hey, you took your time since I called you. Did you see him? He just left. Yes, we had a quick chat. Salim, I've been asking you to talk to him for weeks. - That's not talking to him. - Relax. All Yusuf needs is a job. He is fine. He's not fine. Ma, you have to tell him. Tell me what? Sister, what is it? Salma overheard him on the phone. - He's planning to go to Somalia. - What? We must seek refuge in God from that. He has completely changed. Sometimes he says things and I don't understand him. These people are misleading him. They're taking my son away from me. Uncle, please talk to him. We've tried talking to him. Maybe he'll listen to you. - Where was he going? - To the mosque. I will go after him. But they were right. How can I do my job? And how can we do ours? You are so upset by those boys killed last week in Likoni? I had arrested those boys several times. Took them to court with plenty of evidence. They were just released. These thugs always have some powerful guy behind them. Isn't that right, Mustafa? And every time they walk free. But why? I didn't kill them but good luck to them. Jack. Do you know what they did to that girl in Likoni? I know who they were but… You're new here. Take some advice and keep your mouth shut. You need to understand the lay of the land. Jack. Don't worry. Hang around and you will understand how things work. Don't let thugs disappearing by the sea worry you. - Mustafa, let's go on patrol. - Exactly. Sit down. I know it's hard but they have a point. It's not only thugs. Some of them are innocent young boys who are the same age as my son. I understand you. But we have a difficult job to do. We have to keep Mombasa safe. I've been brought here to work with communities. How do you suggest I do that when this is happening? I must protect the whole community. I have a force that is underpaid, undertrained, undervalued and given inadequate housing to live in. And while we are on the subject, I'm told you refused to live in our quarters. You've moved into an area that we don't consider secure. I grew up in that neighbourhood. Well, be careful, Jack. - Same ringtone. - It's mine. Hello? Yes. Where? I'm on my way. What is it? St Paul's Church has been blown up. But that is our church. My wife is there. Officers, let's go. …regarding that incident. Muhammed Abi, a shopkeeper near the church says that he saw three youths approaching the building, armed with high-tech weapons. - Jack. - Faith. I thought you were dead. I called you and you did not pick up. I lost it in the panic. Jack… You should have seen how those children were killed. Women… mutilated. I don't know, I don't… I've never seen anything like that. Jack, I never knew it was like that. Why bomb a church? People were just worshipping. Faith. - You're safe now. - And what about your child? Are you going to insist on having it here? I told you to stay in Nairobi, but you never listened. These people… Muslims are not people. What? They're all terrorists waiting to kill us. Don't talk like that in this house. I don't want to stay here. Your friend's mother-in-law is talking badly about us. - Mama… - These are not human beings. Our Muslim neighbours are at the church helping people, putting the injured in their cars and taking them to hospital. Our Muslim neighbours are giving blood. You are the one sitting here doing nothing and talking badly. She doesn't know what she is saying. I am a policeman. And I can tell you, these thugs are both Christian and Muslim. And if you are giving them what they want. They want us to fight. You say what you like. But the truth is they want to finish us. Jack. Our reporter at the scene says three children are among the dead including a small baby. Witnesses report that following the explosion, the gunmen opened fire on the survivors as they tried… Yusuf? Yusuf? Yusuf? Yusuf? What's going on? He's dead. Who? Who is dead? Musa. We belong to Allah and to Him, we shall return. Who killed him? Who else Mama? The police. They shot him. They want to blame him for the bomb. - Musufa… - What? I… I don't believe you anymore. Everyone said Musa… was part of Alfajir. And to be honest my son… I think you are too. You see… This is what happens when you get involved with such groups. Enough Mama! Do you want to die too? They can't keep getting away with slaughtering innocent Muslims. But they are tearing this community apart. Have you any idea how much pain I have as your mother? Mama. We have to fight back in the name of Islam. We have to punish these Kafirs. God forbid. This is not Islam. Where does it say it is okay to kill women and children while they are praying? May God forgive you. And uncle Salim… Uncle Salim… What about Uncle Salim? Yusuf! What are you looking for, Yusuf? What are you looking for? A knife. There's no need. Musa is already dead. Yusuf. There's no need. Please come back. Yusuf. - Hello? - Salim. Hi. What did you say to Yusuf? I don't know what to tell you. I've been looking for him the whole day. I don't know where he's hiding. And it's crazy out there. His friend, Musa, has been killed. - Musa has been killed? - Yes, he's been killed. Yusuf is not himself. He's gone crazy. He mentioned you, took a knife and then he left. Hold on, you say he took a knife? Yes. He mentioned you and left. Mentioned my name? - Yes. - Hold on. Are you sure he had a knife? - Yes. - Are you sure? Hello? Salim? Salim. Yusuf? What's going on? N… No. Jack! Yusuf? As I told you before… this is not a good story. But I feel it could've been different and it could have had a different ending. If I'd brought my story to your community. What would you have told me to do? I would like you to watch this play. At the end tell us if there's something we could have done differently. So that the play ends the same or differently. Are we together? Let's watch till the end and then we can hear from you. Okay? Okay. Let's watch the play. Jack. Jack. Jack. Look. Jack. We have to fight back in the name of Islam. We have to punish these Kafirs. Put the knife away. The police are behind you. Is it okay if the play ends like that? What could he have done differently? Yusuf's sister should have snatched the paper from him for evidence. Uncle Salim should have done more to show Yusuf he was on the wrong path. Jack should have held a peace meeting for both Muslims and Christians. At the start, Salim does not emerge as a strong man. The women were undermining him. It's like the women were smarter than him and he had to do what they said. Come. Let's hear your view. Give him a hand. Help him understand. - Salim. - Salim. - Salim. - But he is not a tourist. Come let's see what you got. - Let's go home. - Listen to me… Hold on… Wait. Hold on. This child has no manners. I can't respect you if you don't behave yourself. I won't let you undermine me. That's unacceptable. - Listen to me. - When I talk you have to shut up. Let me show you respect. Once they get the letter from Yusuf they can proceed with investigations. Yusuf's uncle should have looked for a young man to talk to Yusuf. It's sad if your brother is in a difficult position and your mother can do nothing. I saw you with a letter that looked strange. You don't have a phone so I know all you receive is letters. Tell me what's going on and I can help out. I have raised you in a religious way. Know that I love and depend on you. Salim has a responsibility as a parent. What do you think Salim should have done at the cafe with the boys? What do you think Salim should have done at the cafe with the boys? Salim should have asked Yusuf to introduce his friends to him. - So they can explain themselves. - Yes. Salim should have called Yusuf and talked to him about family affairs. So he should've pulled him aside? Salim should have pulled Yusuf aside before he left with his friends. I'm sure Yusuf would have listened to him. That's how things are. - Uncle? - Yes. - Yusuf? - Yes. You've the police here? Just having tea, don't want any trouble. There's a problem. Joseph, Musa and I were talking. As Musa was just saying, its time to decide whose side you're on. What side are you on? I am on the side of justice. Justice? We as Muslims refuse… Somebody is raising their hand. - I don't agree with that. - You don't agree. What would you do if you were Salim? If I were Salim… Salim, excuse me. - Uncle. - Yes. I see you've brought a policeman here. - I see you brought the police. - Why the disrespect? Why? He's a policeman yes, but we are just relaxing, having a soda. Nothing more. As Musa was saying, it's time to decide whose side you're on. What side are you on? I am on the side of justice. What side are you on policeman? What justice? What is justice? What do you know about justice? Musa, I don't understand what you are saying. He must declare whose side he is. He said he is on the justice side. What do you want him to say? Which side do you want him to be on? - Stop contradicting me. - No. You don't understand. Somalia is another country. I don't even know their president. We are Kenyan citizens and we must solve our problems as Kenyans. Let's leave Somalia to its citizens. What do you know about Somalia? We're true Muslims. We know a lot. And according to you, I'm not a Muslim? Yusuf. Yusuf, what do you want from my friend? He saved my father when he was drowning in the sea. Before we used to fight for freedom. What are we fighting for now? That is a very valid point. It's true, Kenyan citizens are in Somalia. But we voted and elected our leaders. Your representative should represent you well on matters of security. It's not up to you to worry about security. - How're they helping you? - But they are failing us. We have to protect ourselves old man. Musa, please respect your elders. - He's wasting our time. - Calm down. Uncle do you know the troubles the Mijikendas go through to get our IDs. Have you ever come to me with a problem like this to see if I could help? Yusuf… I have been through a lot of things, you can't even imagine. You are too young to waste your life. I'm almost 43 years… Even with your many years you're still useless. Don't disrespect your elder. Musa, if you have a point to make, make it. You do not have to be disrespectful. You're just going to let your friend insult me? You don't deserve respect. - You're a chicken seller old man. - Musa… Have some respect and manners. It's time for you young men to leave. I'm going. You are talking badly. I'm going home. Musa, how do you shout at a grown-up? Style up. And also, don't open your mouth if you have nothing respectful to say. Come back, I have more to teach you. You saw how he handled that? - It should be like that. - Yes. - That's the character we were looking for. - Yes. The uncle should have sat down with him as his mother's brother. He should have followed him and found out what was wrong. Yusuf. Son. Are you ignoring me or what? - You'll excuse me. - Hey, Yusuf. I need to talk to you. Come here. Please, Uncle. No more excuses. Listen. Since your father died, I have tried to fill in the gap, though sometimes I fail. That doesn't mean you can disrespect me when I want to talk to you. Come, let's go. Now, let's move. Good. It's fine if you are angry. But you are angry at the wrong things. Jack does not deserve your rage. Don't forget he's a policeman. But he is my blood. He is my relative. Because the uncle is like the head of the family, he should have taken some action. And the first action is knowing that their son has joined a bad group. We don't want them. Why not? Investment is good for everyone. Tourists bring dollars and jobs. Look at me, I had a really good job. Look at me now selling chicken. Have you ever heard of me killing somebody? As the sister, because you knew what had happened, you should have called your mother aside and told her, "My brother has a problem." Do you understand me now Mama? Okay, you say a Muslim is his brother's keeper. It doesn't mean when your brother is killing someone, you should go and do the same. Mama, we are fighting for our rights. Rights? Which rights my son? Yusuf, it's not only coastarians who have been discriminated against. We are not the only ones. Yusuf's sister should have sweet-talked to get information from him. I'm just interested that's all. So now you want to be my friend? I'm your older sister. Why won't you trust me? Yes, we need to fight for our rights. We need access to title deeds. We should benefit more from the port. But do you really think that by murdering innocents, blaming outsiders and fighting each other your life will be better? The nephew is a young man with strong emotions. There was no one to address these emotions because he felt strongly about the things talked about and was really hurt. Would I be the first to die? How many have died? Will I be the last? How many innocent people have died and nothing has been done about it? They just say, "Investigations are still ongoing." We try and go to court, but we are foiled every time. What other way is left to us? You want to go to war with the Government. You should have waited for a solution. There's only one solution. Unless we shed blood they won't listen. You know what I think? I think it will bring us all problems. All of us Muslims, Coastarians, Christians, outsiders, the Somali, foreigners, indeed all of us. You've been treating me like your little brother. You think inviting me to the beach will bring us closer? - Yusuf… - No. I appreciate that you seem to recognise I have grown up. Keep it up. And let's see when I trust you. Yusuf? A good thing to do was to call him and sit him down. There are many great ways of talking to someone. You know why I love this place? We can turn this waste land into something useful. You need to understand that we Coastarians don't have jobs. We still cannot access title deeds. Our ancestors are buried in our lands and we still cannot access title deeds. Exactly. Those are things worth fighting to change. We must have changes here. Why should we share this coast with others? Yusuf, why shouldn't we? You always said you wanted to go to Europe. How many Kenyans are in foreign countries and not asked to leave? Or do you want to be the first one? Do you want to visit people, stay in their house, sleep over, eat their food, but they are not welcome in your place? Yusuf… There are people we elected to represent us in the new County. People like the Governor and Senators. Have you tried talking to them? They wouldn't listen to me. Have you tried? Everyone thinks that if you are radical you are an idiot. But I am no fool. I know you are not a fool. I love my God and I want to serve him. I love God too. We can fight injustice without going against the Koran. Mama! I'm sure you have your dreams. Right? Some are religious, others are personal. Would you like to die before you fulfil your dreams? Talk to me, my son. Is God happy? - We're fighting for our rights. - What rights? What haven't I given you? God has already given you life. What rights? Let's face the fact that you are jobless. Isn't that enough of a challenge to you as the youth? He's smiling. He's smiling. Which rights are these that I, your mother, have not given to you? What are these rights that God has not given you? What rights? I'm not objecting. I get all the rights a child needs from the parent. - But… - True there is no justice. But there are other ways of dealing with our woes. And it's not by killing people. Without shedding blood. - But… - Shut up and let me hug you. It's been a while since I hugged you. Let go. - I miss the Salma who used to bully me. - Come here. - Watch it. Kiss who? - Let me kiss you. Let me kiss you. He should have found some expert ways, and taught him the disadvantages of joining a terrorist group. He would have understood and been helped. Yusuf… don't you see? Al Fajiri is funded by some rich people to manipulate the youth for their own ends. They use young men who have anger issues to fight their religious wars. And also use you as their foot soldiers. Yusuf. Don't let them use you. Pick an issue, something like youth unemployment. Make as much noise as we can until they listen. - You're a dreamer, Uncle. - I'm not dreaming. Do something and maybe we can do it together. I think there's hope. What you're saying is having an effect. My story is taking a new direction. Perhaps… if we could go back, just a little… If we could use what you've said, could we change things? While on the subject, I'm told you've refused to stay in police quarters. You've moved into an area that we don't consider secure. - When I bought it, it was working. - Well, be careful Jack. - It's my wife. - Talk to her. Hello. Sorry, I'm running late. I'm on my way. I'm meant to be at the church with her. Jack. But please be careful Jack. We need men like you. I don't want to be at your funeral. I wouldn't want that either. Go to church. Yusuf? What are you doing here? I'm going to see somebody. I'm sorry we got off to a bad start. It's fine. Salim says you want to help. Well, I'm trying. But I hate who you work for. I know people feel that way. - Well excuse me. I'm a bit late. - Uh… It looks like a happy place. It is. You are very welcome to come. I don't like the look of it. Next week I have a meeting with the Senator. I would like you to come. What? The Senator is going around shouting about the importance of dialogue. Think about it. I'll call you. I'm here to stay. I am never letting go. Baby, it's morning. Her style is always up to date. You are just staring instead of coming to help? My wife, believe it, I'm cooking something very delicious. I can't eat that. I want pizza. Pizza for what? You disapprove of everything I do in this house. - Salim… - Shut up, I'm speaking. Everything I do you dislike. - Salim… - No. Listen, my house, my wife, my rules. So we'll cook whatever I say we cook. Who are you? I'm the owner of this house. Pack and leave if you're tired of staying here. Nobody will bother following you. Okay? But before that, you are going next door to apologise to Jack. And invite them for food. Go. You heard him. I don't think you understand me. Leave. I'm talking to you. Move. Faster, faster. Move! Close the door behind you. As my uncle always says, we can bring change. If we follow what we've discussed today… we can make very big changes. Thank you. Thank you for helping me bring my family back together. You've seen that we all have choices to make. How we make those choices is what's important. What can you do? Remember. Our Mombasa. Our future. Goodnight.
