Toei Company Ltd. Today will be my best day too. My child...congratulations. - My best wishes to you. - Thank you and same to you. Father, I'll see you next Sunday. New York May 24, 1973 New York underworld crime boss Don Salbadole Locco has been killed in an attack by the rival Asian Yellow Mafia. A Japanese woman who is believed to have been aiding Rocco has been missing ever since the incident. BODYGUARD KIBA Listen up, everyone! We, the "Black 8", are hijacking this aircraft! Stay quiet! Don't move! You're being held hostage for 5 million dollars! After we refuel in Haneda, we're departing for the Middle East! If you try anything suspicious before then, I can't guarantee your life! Everyone put your hands together behind your head. Put your hands up. - Resist and I'll shoot you. - You're the one who's gonna die. What?!

Welcome, Mr. Kiba. The Japanese have been disgraced ever since the incident at the airport near Tel Aviv. It would appear that you have restored our honor all at once. Am I right that this sort of nationalism is the reasoning behind your actions? Not really. Then it must have been because of humanism, right? Nope. - It's just commercialism. - Commercialism, you say? What do you mean by that? It's my own personal commercial. Nah, just kidding! It's a commercial to get the word out to the media about Tesshinkai karate. I guess I could put it that way. Somebody get me a cola. - Bring one in. - Okay! Thank you. Only one other person in the world is capable of executing a move like this. My mentor Daito Tetsugen. I'm his pupil, a sixth-dan Tesshinkai karate black belt. Daito Tetsugen.... You mean the karate sensei who killed a raging bull with one punch? That's him. Wild stories like that have been the extent of Tesshinkai karate's reputation up to now. But the truth is different. I didn't mean anything bad by it. It's cool. Now, to help you in the media see Tesshinkai karate in a new light, I'd like to do a little PR on behalf of my beleaguered master, who is training in the mountains. And did he come here to support me? No. I don't need it. My Tesshinkai-style karate uses frightening destructive power and extreme techniques so it is looked down upon and called a wicked path and bull-killer technique. Sadly, unable to gain society's acceptance, my master journeyed to America alone. He challenged over 100 pro boxers and wrestlers from every land over North and South America, and defeated them all. And he was feared as "Kaminote", in other words, "Godhand". But when he returned to the country, the Japanese karate society's response was still as cold as ever. I'll tell you why. It's because Daito Tetsugen was just too powerful. I traced my master's path for three years and underwent training all throughout the U.S. As a result, I felt a strong need to make myself into PR material for Tesshinkai karate. In other words... I'm putting Tesshinkai Karate to practical use and starting a professional bodyguard business. I call it "Godhand". I hereby announce the foundation of this organization. So... If anyone watching on TV has need of my strength, don't hesitate. I would like you to request my help. No matter how horrifying a killer is... ...the Godhand will surely protect your life. People hate it when commercials are too long. So farewell. Big brother, what's the big idea? You come back after three years, and now you're suddenly starting up a bodyguard business. Unbelievable. It's just as I announced to the media. No matter how many times people hear the name Tesshinkai..... ...they still won't deal with me. It was the same way even in America. Even after beating the pros there... ...the media will only get excited about people who are famous. That's what got me thinking. I could sell Tesshinkai karate using the media. You're planning to use Tesshinkai for your own fame and wealth, aren't you? No, just the opposite. I'm using my own body to earn the funds to restore Tesshinkai karate. I'm against that sort of commercialism. And there's no way Master Tetsugen would be pleased about it either. The master has his own way of life. I'm sick of the old-fashioned way of living of just devoting oneself to training alone. If society won't recognize Tesshinkai, I'll just have to make them recognize it... ...in my own special way. Violence. That's always your way. You're fearless, and you stick your nose into every dangerous thing. Three years ago I worked as a bodyguard and fought against gangsters. So why did I leave Japan? Because it wasn't helping me get ahead. There's no other way to take us to the top. - But... - Well, you're my assistant for now. - Me?! - Yeah, of course. Don't you think the attic of a church is the perfect location for Godhand headquarters? No, I don't! I saw you talking on television. Good, then my message was heard. Come on in. Don't worry, this is my sister Maki. She's a first-dan blackbelt in Tesshinkai karate. Hey, no, I'm a second-dan now! I want you to guard me. I am scared for my life. Who is after you? Just someone who wants me dead. Do you need to know that in order to be my bodyguard? A bodyguard should know his opponent. So you want to keep it private, huh? What'll it cost? At least 10 million yen. I get 5 million yen up front. - Will a check be alright? - Sure. I left my checkbook in the car... Wait. Give me your keys. My work as your bodyguard has already begun. - Maki, go get it. - Okay. It's in the car's glovebox. Please. What's taking so long? Maki! Maki!!! Who did this, Maki? Cosa Nostra. Cosa Nostra. I guess that's all I can do. - It's alright, I'm okay. - How many were there? Four of them. With tattoos on their hands. Tattoos? Yes, star-shaped ones. They must have mistaken her for you. And now they have made a second mistake. Now they have challenged the Godhand. Cosa Nostra. That's Italian for "Our Thing". The mafia's eyes are watching your every move. I need your help...please. Write out the check. - Where's the light switch? - Just to the left as you enter. Come on in. You're really careful. This is the typical routine. Stay away from the windows to avoid getting shot. And always let me know if anyone comes to your door. Even if it's just the maid, I'll deal with her. Whatever you say, Mr. Bodyguard! The name's Kiba. A nightcap would be really nice right about now, Mr. Kiba! Aren't you going to drink too? - Not for the next four days while I'm guarding you. - Not at all? No. Your life depends on it, after all. That's reassuring. I'm sure it's worth it to you. Let's have a drink in five days when it's over. It's marvelous, after all. If it's safe I will. Fifty million yen for four days. That's cheap. So this calloused hand of yours is worth fifty million yen... It's not a showpiece. It's for winning. All your power resides in that hand. This is my first time back to Tokyo in five years. It's changed a lot. You'll guard me for the next four days, then it's off to Paris. But that's private. This will be good promotional material for your work. Good night. Just call for me if you need anything. Good night. Please, I don't know anything at all! - I can't leave you behind to talk! - No! Help me! It's alright now. Ursa Major. One of the yellow mafia's seven known killers. Where do they fit in? This is odd... Why didn't they just kill you instead of tying you up? I have no idea! Is that all you can ask?! What a collection of fighters. Maybe we could arrange a funeral service. We shouldn't stay here! If we're going to get out of here, we'd better do it now. Boss, someone's here to see you. - So you're in contact with her. - Yes. - Good. Does she have "Mr. White"? - I'm sure. - Tell her we'll meet up tomorrow. - Yes. Takami... We're only dealing with one woman... You know what I mean. It's alright... We have some private business to handle. Wait... I thought I'd seen you somewhere before. You've been doing some fancy promoting on TV. Looks like you've found yourself a generous new sponsor, too. Would you give us some privacy, please? It'll only take me three seconds to get in here if you need me. What did you hire a guy like that for? If it weren't for him, I'd have been killed last night. The mafia followed you all the way from New York. I see... So the leader of the bar gang is gonna bleed. What do you want? - It's been five years... - You should have used the phone. You're living a mellow life. Nice and relaxing. You used to prowl the streets at night looking for men... Even when there was no sign of them. I let that girl go. I didn't expect you to become the lady you are now... - Don't try to sweet talk me. - Come on, sweetheart... I'm not what I used to be. That doesn't mean that we can't enjoy ourselves. I thought we were going to talk about business. I guess you have someone else to spend your evenings with now. Don't be an idiot. - I hate you. - We haven't finished talking business. Sweetheart... Or would you prefer it if I used your work name "Naomi"? Play along and you'll get what you're after. What do you want? I'm talking about doubling our profits. The stuff you have is worth half a billion. We'll take their money and keep the drugs. Together that'll add up to a billion yen. Even a kid can figure that out. That sounds good. Clever idea. That's half a billion for each of us. You haven't changed a bit. You have, and you look better to me than you ever did. You're the one who broke my heart... Get your hands off! Fuckin' son of a bitch! Get lost! Don't touch my brother's girl. Get out. - Okay. Wanting yen or dollar? - Yen. - Sixteen thousand. - Yes. - I haven't had a woman yet. - Oh? Wait there. Hey, bring Diane. Hey, your time is up! That's all you paid for! Time over! - You, go with this guy. - No, I don't want to. I don't care if you don't want to. That's it. Now you're turning me on. Ow! Yes. - That's right. - That's right. Very nice girl. Come on, baby. Brother! Whaddaya know? That looks like the karate guy from TV. You know what? She looks out of place. She's not the kind of woman you would see in a place like this. Very fuckin' nice girls in here! I smell money! - Did you receive it? - Everything is alright. I'll wait for you tomorrow morning at two o'clock. Okay. Light? Nice lighter. I want to use it again. Next time I'll use it to burn your business down. Don't count on it. Three thousand dollars. Okay. Johnnie's waiting. Go ahead. MORGUE Okay. This is my last job. The Vietnam War is over, so I'm going home. This is the last body and my last job. I would like a bonus. Why? I gave you three thousand dollars. I would like to be paid with your body. Stop it! Shall I put you in the coffin? You're hurting my hand! I was only joking! You don't want to get involved, right? - Pull off the road. - Huh? Pull in over there. - Why are we... - Shhh! - Mafia, I think. - Huh? There. The mafia would know better than to tail us like that. It seems like there's another group of gangsters after you. I think they're gone. Let's go. The coffin has come open. Now I understand. There must be a lot of people who are after this. Have you ever wondered how many people are suffering because of that white powder? I didn't hire you to give me a sermon. The mafia won't stop at anything to get hold of the drugs. There's only so much I can do to protect you. But I supposed you have your reasons. That's right. Salbadole Locco was my lover. Locco was killed, all because of this stuff. I'm gonna get the money back if it's the last thing that I do. I suppose you're going to turn me in... The police certainly wouldn't be very happy about this. You're sending the mafia boss's girlfriend to jail. If you tell that to the press they'll jump all over it. It can be your new PR campaign. But that's against the rules. If you abandon me, you'll be failing me as a bodyguard. That's no way to become the top bodyguard. Is that what you're going to say when you're behind bars? You can't drive a car through the city in this condition. You don't want to get pulled over by some rookie. Don't you see? It's the last chance I've got! I'm about ready to break the contract. I'll guard your life, but I don't care what happens to that stuff. It's fine. I don't need your help. Tomorrow it'll all be over. Come on, drink up! The drink's on me! Everybody drink! Come on, let's go! Sure, sure. Free girls! Come on, drink up everybody! Come on, let's have a drink! Yeah, I'm going home! What a great feeling! Come on, let's drink! Everybody! Come on, drink up! Joe! I told you before not to spend so much money. Get out. - Don't worry about it, I'm alright. - Joe! Hey, wait! Take it easy. No! Aaah! What did she bring there? Huh? I don't know anything. Let me go. Goddammit, bastard! - You talk me! - No! You tell me eveything. Tell me! - No, never... - What, never?! You talk me! Talk me! Talk! Talk! Hey, talk! He's had it. Maybe he really didn't know. Maybe we can get it out of Joe. I found this. Interesting... Mafia. Brother! Joe... Not pretty... Mafia, I think. Oh yeah? Mafia, huh? Let's do this. It's a warning. Mafia...! It's the mafia! You might want to reconsider this. I have to keep going. That's the boss. We've been waiting for you. So, this is Reiko? - Let's do the deal. - Let's see it. That's very good. You're a reliable bodyguard. This is just some stuff you took off the mafia. There's no reason to pay for it when we can take it for free. Now take care of them. You can start with the bodyguard. Takami. Shoot them. She's my girl. We planned it this way. What do you know? Looks like they pulled one over on you! Stay low. Drop the gun. Give me the bag. So it's them. Heh. No more of those wimps. I know you. You're hungry to get ahead. You're working as a thug but you're running drugs on the side. This is what you get. Now you've made yourself a target. Doesn't seem worth it. That was the don's deal. It was a different deal. I've heard about you. Three brothers doing drug deals on the American army base. And I understand you guys play a pretty rough game too. So you'd better tell us what we want to know. So tell us. Is it just those two? Yes. But you're gonna have trouble with that bodyguard. He can take you all on. Sure. What the hell. You three were able to cause trouble for the mafia... But you can't take on this guy. He's on another level. Whatever... You small-timers are out of your depth. Unless you want to get hurt, stay out of the Hotel Plaza. We'll hunt him together. How long are you going to carry all that stuff around? You're gonna get killed over it. You ought to get rid of it. - I don't want to get rid of it. - It's for your own sake! When I turn this into hard cash... ...I'll be winning for the first time. I was abandoned by my parents and clueless about men when I was a young girl. You don't know what it's like to be ridiculed and made to feel all alone. I would know! I've been there! What do you think a woman has to do in order to get ahead in this world? I'm old enough to know myself. It's the same as being lovers... ...but the price is different. And that's the mentality that got you that ring. That's right. I bought this 10-carat emerald myself. These are carats and you are karate... That's right... You're two of a kind. No, we're not. Karate can't be bought with money. Yet you take the money anyway. In order to eat! I think we can pull this off if you're involved. Cut it out. You've always been manipulating men like that. You should give up thinking that it will work on me. Our contract is still valid and things will remain strictly business. Very well. If you want to follow the contract, we'll do it that way. That works better for promoting karate's values anyway, doesn't it? I'm sure you'll have a great time spewing your bull-killer PR! This worked out nicely... So where do I find the stuff? Brother! This doesn't settle anything. Fool. You were stupid to go it alone. I would've gotten him if I'd had a gun... That costs money! Your bright ideas got you into this! So shut up! I knew you guys would try something. I guess you got the stuff, then. We will. Next time for sure. Fair enough. But how are you going to get that guy out of the way? You're a tough bunch of guys. But your brains... What about our brains? - They're not so good, are they? - What? You want some of this? If I die, you won't be able to get anything at all. I'm the only one who can get her to do anything. Right? I'm sorry... No need to be sorry. It's just business. So, business, huh? Hello? Right. Got it. Bye. Where's your guard dog? I was just talking with him. He's probably around here somewhere. Where's the customer? Be careful. There are three bastards out here trying to kill you. Not so fast. You got three guys watching you, you know. I was just testing to see if that guard dog bastard would show up. I think you're underestimating us. It seems you're really on top of things. But not when it comes to her. Let's go for a walk. Stay back or I'll kill him! Looks like I'm on the hook for this one. A bodyguard would be useful right now. Careful! Stay down! Damn them! Stay calm. Stay right here. Get down! So I've lost, all because of this deal and my desire for money. I grew up poor, too. But now you're a bodyguard... Karate is the only way I can make a living. I hate being poor. I hate being poor... There was no other way for me if I didn't make this deal. I lived only for this... Great work! You did it! We now understand the true power of Tesshinkai karate. So, are you going abroad to do PR? Do you have anything else planned? I've finished advertising my skills to Japan. Next, the rest of the world! THE END
