What I remember most about that day was the calm. There wasn't a hint of breeze. It didn't fool me any, though. I knew it was just the lull before the storm. Only this storm wasn't from the heavens. This storm came courtesy of the U.S. mail. Huh! Isaiah! Isaiah Griffin, where are you?! Hi, Andrea! Hi! Well, well! You must be Travis. I'm... I know. You're Isaiah. My mom says you're the best ever. And that Aunt Lettie'd be lost without you. Yeah, she's right about that. Where is she? Miss Lettie? Oh, she's at home. She told me to tell you she's real sorry she couldn't come and get you. She had business to tend to. To tell you the truth, she don't get out much. Bet she's tying balloons on the front porch for me. Mom says she does that for important celebrations. Uh, Travis... we didn't know nothing about you till yesterday. About my visit? No, about you. Alison is not much of a letter writer. I know. And I don't remember she ever mentioned she had a daughter. Didn't you get my school pictures I sent? I signed them and everything. Well, Travis, we didn't get no letters but you know how the mail is. Not too dependable, huh? That's right. Well, I hope you like traveling in style. You get to ride in the sardine can. Sardine can? Yup, that's what I call her. My first second-hand truck. Not a scratch or dent on her. And you won't find a speck of dust inside, neither. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, no! Wipe your feet before you get in. What's wrong with this place? Wrong? Yeah, there's nothing here. Not even people. Well, what do you call her? People are supposed to come in bunches. They're supposed to walk fast and be scrunched up together. Oh, I see. And where's all the sirens and stuff? What stuff? Traffic... noise... stuff like that. I'm afraid we ain't got any. You don't got a drug store, either. This must be the most boring town in the whole world, huh? Yeah, I guess. Guess where mom and I are moving now? Where? California. Yeah, is that so? We've already lived in 28 states. You two sure like being on the road, huh? It's 'cause she's a singer. Oh... Mostly she waits tables but she likes singing best. Well, your mama loved music. She's going to be the singer for this band in Hollywood. Oh. Only first she has to get settled. Ah. Then we're going to get a place right under the Hollywood sign. That's where all the stars live. Yeah. Well, the only stars here are in the sky. But we've got plenty of sheep. I know. Yeah... sheep, lamb. Miss Lettie's got quite a flock. Keeps me busy. All God's creatures need care, you know. There it is. She lives here all by herself? Yeah. This is a mansion, huh? Yeah. She must be upstairs fixing her face 'cause I'm company. Miss Lettie! We're here! Miss Lettie? Wait here while I go get her, okay? Miss Lettie? Miss Lettie! She's here, Miss Lettie, safe and sound. Why don't you come down and say "hello" to her? You hear me? Come on, I know you're in there now. Why are you banging on my door? To get your attention. Well, you've got it. Now, what can I do for you? I want you to walk down those stairs and give Travis a proper greeting. If you're expecting me to be the Welcome Wagon, you can forget it. There ain't nothing worse than an obstinate old woman. Hey, whoa, whoa! No, no, no. Nodody's allowed in the dining room, Travis. Now, this is for special occasions. I think it's awesome. If it were mine, I'd use it all the time. No, no, no! This is Miss Lettie's good china. You can't eat off it. But that doesn't make any sense. Well, if it's sense you want, you've come to the wrong place. Now, come on. Miss Lettie? Hmm? This is your niece. Travis. Well, how do you do, Travis? What kind of name is that? Don't go saying it's a boy's name. I'm sick of people telling me that. What was Alison thinking about? I thought you'd be bigger. My mom said you were formida... Formidable! Well, I'm delighted Alison knew the word. Is that how you dress for travel? I dress for comfort. That's what you're supposed to do when you travel. Well, then you've done a formidable job. Excuse us. Mm-hmm. I thought you might like this room. There are big bedrooms upstairs but this is my favorite. Besides, you got a view of my house from here. That's my mama hanging out the wash. She ought to go to the Laundromat. Oh, no, no. There's nothing like sun-dried clothes. Makes them smell like flowers. The Laundromat's better. They've got candy machines. I thought great-aunts would be great. All she is is regular. Maybe she's having a bad day, huh? Maybe. I never had a waffle iron. But one time, we had this room with a bed that pulled out of the wall. You all sound like gypsies. Mom says we're free spirits. What kind of house is this? No potato chips, no cookies no popcorn. I'm going to starve here. Can't use this either, I bet. Oh, no, no! Uh-uh, that's for the Mahjongg Club. What's "Mahjongg"? It's an excuse for Miss Lettie and the ladies to get together and gossip. Well, what does she do up there? She's busy bookkeeping, working the farm accounts. Didn't look busy. Mostly she's busy adjusting. To what? To you. : My mom said this place is just like heaven. Sure doesn't smell like it. How do you know what heaven smells like? Can I help you feed the chickens? Mm-hmm. And in the morning, we'll, uh... collect the eggs. For real? Oh, yeah. There's a lot of chores to do around here. You can be my helper, if you want. Can I feed the sheep? Oh, this one's my favorite. What's his name? Her name. That's Tallulah. Come here, Tallulah. Come on, girl. Oh, she likes me, huh? Yeah. You're all warm, aren't you, Tallulah? Looks like you made a friend. Must be nice to have a pet, huh? Yeah. Must be the nicest thing in the world. How come you didn't make enough for Miss Lettie? Oh, I don't cook for her. She takes care of herself. You've been scrubbing that thing forever. Well, Miss Lettie likes things done just so. Miss Lettie; Mama... Does everybody here talk like that? Yes, ma'am. We surely do. What's our next chore? Well, we're done for the day. You going home now? I'll stay a while longer, if you want. I know how to baby-sit myself. I've been doing it forever. Oh, okay. Don't feed the chickens without me. I won't. Night, Isaiah. Good night. You're here bright and early. I'm always here bright and early. Mmm? Well, you're particularly early today. Well, I got a little girl to check up on. That little girl is my business, you know. As long as you go on ignoring her, she's my business. I haven't been ignoring her. Yeah. You know... she's only here for a couple of weeks. Maybe you should get to know her. You know, there's a whole section here you missed. Yeah, I see it. What in the world is wrong with Alison? Why did she let so many years go by before telling me she has a daughter? Well, she was probably scared to tell you after the way you blew up over that boyfriend of hers. Ah, yeah, well, I was right, wasn't I? Oh, you're always right. Look where right's got you. I am perfectly content. Contrary, you mean! Sitting up there in your office all day hiding from your own flesh and blood. I haven't been hiding. Mm-hmm. Listen... Travis is family. Why don't you give her a chance? You mean like I did Alison? Look... just because you love somebody doesn't mean they always do what you want them to do. Good morning. Good morning. My, this is quite a mess. What is it you think you're doing? Cooking us breakfast. Well, I only have tea in the morning, so... I can make it for you. Usually I make coffee for my mom 'cause she's not a morning person, either. But I'm positive I can cook tea. Oh, really? My mom says I'm even better than all those TV cooking chefs. Your mom is certainly full of surprises, isn't she? What's wrong with surprises? They tend to wear me out. Oh, put the ball away. Why? Because we don't play ball in the house. Never did see much point in baseball. How can anybody not like baseball? I expect you to clean up this mess when you're finished. But... I made breakfast for the two of us. I didn't even use any of your Mahjongg stuff. I have never had a finer breakfast. Don't tell Nadine I said that, though. Who's Nadine? Well, she's my wife. Her peach cobbler took first place at the county fair. You've got a wife?! Well, of course I do. The Good Book says that every man needs a helpmate. Well, where is she? Oh, she's got a job. A good job, too. Is she a bartender? No! She drives the bookmobile. Bookmobile?! Mm-hmm. What's that? Well, it's kind of like a library on wheels. Weird. Mmm. Hey, this is certainly delicious. What do you call it? Peanut butter dreams. Mmm! Mmm! You've got how many brothers and sisters? Seven. How come you're so old and you still live at home? Well, being the oldest, I stayed to help out while the others moved on. Sometimes I make up a family for myself. You do? Like when I was in second grade I told my class that my dad was a lion tamer for the circus. And that he was always on the road. After that, everybody was nice to me because I told them that when he got back he would give us all free circus tickets. It's a good thing I only stayed at that school for a month or I'd have been in big trouble, huh? Yeah, yeah. Your daddy still play the guitar? Do you think maybe she's a vampire? Miss Lettie? What put that into your head? 'Cause she comes out mostly at night after I'm asleep. I never thought about that, but maybe you're right. How come she doesn't like me? It's got nothing to do with you. It does so. No, it doesn't. She's just hurting. Hurting from what? Well, love, I reckon. Seems that everybody she ever loved disappeared one way or another. That's a lot of heartache for one woman, so you've got to be patient with her. Well, she's not patient with me. Well, just give her time. Give her time. Don't forget! I get to help collect the eggs! Miss Lettie says she like her eggs fresh. You know what, Travis, it's time for you to start calling her "Aunt Lettie." She doesn't act like an aunt, she acts like a miss. Mail's here! That's mine! Dear Travis... well... I'm not going to be a singer after all. I was fired. Maybe all I'm good at is being a waitress. I've been thinking it over and until I get myself together, I want you to stay there with Aunt Lettie. I know you'll have a good time, and I know Isaiah and Aunt Lettie will take good care of you. It might be a while. I'm sorry, Travis. All my love forever. Mom. You ought to just let me buy a new latch. My grandfather put that latch on the gate. It's an antique. Well, an antique is valuable. This is just old and worn out. What's the matter with Travis? She's been moping around all afternoon. Well, a letter came. From Alison? Uh-huh. Well, what did it say? Well, you better get used to being an aunt again 'cause it looks like Travis is going to be here for a while. How long? Way longer than two weeks. Seems that Alison had a setback. She's going to need some time to get herself together. Mmm. And has the musician had a setback, too? I'm not sure he's still in the picture. Is that what Travis said? No... but whenever I ask her about him, I get one of these. Uh-huh. Well, that child is not my responsibility. She is now. What if my mom forgets what I look like, Tallulah? I should be with her. I'm the one who brings her good luck and stuff. What are you wearing a suit for? Oh, it's Sunday. So? Sunday, I go to church. Whole family does. I've never been to church. You haven't? Well, it's something special, all right. Wish I could go. Well, I'd be happy to have you, Travis, but you need to get Miss Lettie's permission first. I could do that. What time are we going? Well, not till 9:30, but... Well, don't go waking her, Travis, she... It's okay! Oh, no. Lettie, aren't you up yet? It's exactly 7:20! I know, I've been up forever. What...? You've got tons of stuff, huh? Um, uh, put that down, please. Thank you. My, you are elegantly dressed today. That's 'cause I'm going somewhere fancy. Really? Mind telling me where? Church. Is that so? Mm-hmm. Only I'm supposed to get permission from you first. Isaiah said. So you mean to tell me that you're going to church with Isaiah? Mm-hmm. That should be interesting. I know. I've never been. To church? Mom and me sleep in on Sundays. I. Huh? "Mom and I... I sleep in on Sundays." I know, it's already 7:30. No, uh... Never mind. Mom always does a double shift on Saturdays 'cause the tips are good. But by Sunday, her feet are all blistery. Well, let that be a lesson to you. What kind of lesson? You finish school, that way you won't have to do double shifts. And you won't get blisters. This is for the collection plate. And I don't want you twisting and turning in your seat. You're an Anderson, and the Anderson girls know how to conduct themselves in public. Come on, sweetheart. Hey. Come on. You smell really good. Must be from drying out in the sun like your sheets. Do you mind if she stays for dinner, Lettie? She doesn't. Do you? That's awfully sweet of you. Thank you, but don't you go filling her up with sweets. Don't need any stomachaches around here. We'll get her back to you safe and sound. Don't you worry. Oh, I'm not worried. Hey, Tallulah. You really like that girl, don't you? Yeah, you do. Well, I can see where you would. Don't get used to her. Well, this town ain't going to be so boring no more. How come? 'Cause the drug store is about to reopen, that's why. Now who on who on Earth would be opening a drug store? Mr. Samuel Madison, that's who. Lord have mercy. Who's Mr. Samuel Madison. Well, he's the most famous person from these parts. Baseball player. Played shortstop for a farm team. Why would a shortstop buy a dumb old drugstore? Probably has some unfinished business to attend to. ? He's got the whole world in his hands ? ? He's got the whole world in his hands ? ? He's got the whole world in his hands ? ? He's got the whole world in his hands ? ? He's got you and me brother in his hands ? ? He's got you and me brother in his hands ? ? He's got you and me brother in his hands ? ? He's got the whole world in his hands ? ? He's got the little bittie babies in his hands ? ? He's got the little bittie babies in his hands ? ? He's got the little bittie babies in his hands ? ? He's got the whole world in his hands. ? Mmm, this is so good. This tastes good. Mildred and Lettie used to slip off over here for dinner all the time. Who's Mildred? Child, are you telling me you never heard of Mildred? Well, she's your grandma-- your mama's mama. Where is she? Passed. Passed? She and your grandpa both. Killed in a car wreck when Alison was just 3 years old. That's how Lettie come to raise your mama. And let me tell you something, she was a handful. Didn't want nothing to do with this small town, no, ma'am. She had stars in her eyes. She was going to be a famous singer. That's all she talked about. I'd be trying to teach her to knit, she'd be talking a mile a minute. I could learn to knit too, huh? I just bet you could do anything you put your mind to. You know what that child told me? She's never sat down to a family dinner. Family dinners are overrated. Sounds to me like Alison and Travis were living on soda pops and pizza. They've barely been able to survive. Well, Alison certainly made her Christmas cards sound as though they were living in the lap of luxury, didn't they? "Wintering in Florida... visiting a friend in Manhattan." Oh, that was pride writing to you. But if she had told me she had a baby, I could've helped them. I know that. But I'm not sure Alison did. No, because that man had her fooled. Oh, what a charmer he was, huh? Well, charm doesn't feed a wife and it sure doesn't feed a baby. No, sure won't. He was far too old for her. Would you tell me what a 25-year-old man sees in a 17-year-old girl? Besides that. Well, it was love. She took one look at him playing his guitar and it was love at first sight. Well, if there's one thing even more overrated than family dinners... it's first love. Honk, honk. What are you doing? I'm going on a picnic. You want to come? It's the Fourth of July. I know what day it is. Every Fourth of July you used to bake a pecan pie-- then you'd go to the park to watch the fireworks. What else did your mother tell you about me? Some things. Well, don't expect me to go driving you to the park. People change. I can go with Isaiah. And how's Isaiah going to get any work done with you trailing around after him? It's a holiday. He doesn't have to work on holidays. Oh, really? Well, who's going to look after things here? Me. I'm assistant numero uno. Oh. Guess what my job is today? I have to sing to them. Sing to whom? To the sheep. It keeps them calm. I've got the touch, just like Isaiah. Is that so? I made bologna and cheese double-decker sandwiches. There's enough for two. Uh, I want you out of this car. Why? It's off limits, that's why. Well, you never drive it. Look at these things. It's lucky you didn't poke a hole in the seat. They're not things-- they're knitting needles. They're... weapons of destruction. They're mine. I'm knitting just like my mom. I didn't know your mom ever knitted. My mom did too knit. Mama Rose taught her. Being taught something and actually doing it are two very different things. My mom does lots of stuff. Like what? Receptionist and coat-check girl and next month we're flying to Alaska so we can live in an igloo. Next month you're going to be attending school right here. So you better get used to that. Your dumb car has squeaky brakes. Dumb old town... doesn't even have sidewalks. How much does a glass of water cost? Oh, a glass water... That would be on the house. What's your name? Travis. Travis? Well, Travis, it's nice to meet you. My name is Sam Madison. I know. Guess what I've got for you? My triple-treat Fourth of July special. Go on, take it. It won't cost you a penny. Thanks. How come everything's free? 'Cause you're my first customer. Of course tomorrow, I'll have to charge you double. How come you moved back here? It's got nothing, you know. It's my hometown. I always dreamed of coming back home. You're from the city, huh? How'd you guess? Easy, you're... sophisticated. City people know how to do stuff. People here, some of them, are peculiar. Like where I live, there's this huge, huge dining room. Only Miss Lettie won't let anybody eat in it. Miss Lettie? I call her that because I'm no way ever going to call her aunt. I guess that living room is spectacular. Oh, it is. The whole house is. You'd like it. I bet I would. Thanks for the ice cream. Bye! See you later! What was that about? Huh? I don't want you accepting rides from strangers. He's not a stranger, he's Mr. Samuel Madison. He's famous. Oh, don't be silly. Sam Madison hasn't lived around here for a long time. Uh-huh, he just moved back. And guess what? I couldn't possibly. He's a widow. Really? Uh-huh, I told him about how you hate baseball and stuff. Why on Earth did you tell him that? 'Cause he was interested in us. He especially liked the part about how you never got married. Why is your face all pink? I don't like the idea of you running around town telling tales about me. I wasn't telling tales. Mostly we were talking about business. You know, how to make quality ice cream-- stuff like that. Well, you just make sure you know the difference between your stuff and my stuff... young lady. My, my, look at all of these candy wrappers. Hey, this looks like Mr. Madison! Um... put that away. This is my Mahjongg day, you know. I know. Why don't you go read a book? Who are all these people? Relatives. This one's my favorite. Who is this lady? She's the prettiest. Oh, that's my sister Mildred. My grandma? Yes. Grandma Mildred looks exactly like my mom. All right, let's put this away. I never got to meet her 'cause she passed. Isaiah's mom told me. Mildred was the sweet one and you were the feisty one! Your feet don't belong on the furniture. How come nobody tells me all this family stuff? There's not much to tell. Don't we have any more relatives? Isaiah's house is full of relatives. Why is yours so empty? Because that's the way I want it: empty. Quiet, peaceful. Oh, what I wouldn't give for some peace and quiet. It is quiet-- too quiet! I hate it here! It's the saddest place I've ever been. And guess who else I saw in the album? Mr. Madison. I saw him! Maybe you did. I did? I'm not saying one more word till you finish your knitting. I bet you have some real good secrets, Mama Rose. Thanks for coming, Louise, Lucille. Catch you later, Nick. We had a full house at lunch, huh? Yep. On days like today, folks don't want to cook. You know who's a great cook? Miss Lettie. Have you heard about her molasses cookies? Not recently. You know all the stuff I was saying about her the other day? Well, she's not that bad. Her favorite game is Mahjongg. After that, it's baseball. Really? Today's Mahjongg day. She made iced tea with mint in it. You don't say? Even used the crystal glasses. Pretty fancy. Miss Lettie is very, very tidy. And guess what else? She put flowers in all the vases. Gardenias? How'd you know? Gardenias and iced tea. Sounds pretty nice. You look rested today, Lettie. I can't imagine why. This farm is killing me. Taxes keep going up and the price of wool is going down, down, down. Two dots. You ought to move, put your feet up and let somebody else work for a change. Well, the Anderson farm's been here forever. Now, Lettie couldn't sell it. Why not? She's all alone now. Not quite. Who'll take over this place when you're gone, Lettie? Alison isn't interested, and... there is no family. What about Travis? And when are we going to get to meet her anyway? Isaiah is always bragging about how bright she is. When is Alison coming home? Who'd like some more iced tea? Dear Aunt Lettie I hope you like your birthday gift. It took ages. Mama Rose taught me to knit. I love you with all my heart. Forever, Alison. When are you going to tell me more? More of what? More about Miss Lettie and Mr. Madison. Oh. Well, let's see. The whole town knew that Samuel Madison was going to make something of himself. All the girls chased after him, but he wasn't interested. Did Miss Lettie chase him? Not Lettie. That wasn't her style. Maybe that's why he was so fond of her. Watch out. You dropped a stitch. Knitting's hard. Pretty soon your fingers'll be flying. My old bones are talking to me today. Talking to you? What are they saying? Storm's coming. Fall's just around the corner. I hate fall. Why is that? Fall means school. Oh... : I see. Winter's the worst, though. It gets all cold and slushy. Everybody gets in bad moods 'cause of the holidays. Even Mom. They ought to just forget winters, period. Forget winters? Oh, sweetheart, every season is special. In spring, the ground thaws so we can replant again. And summer's the time for just rejoicing in the sun. In the fall, we gather in the harvest, and in winter, the Lord sends the cold so we sit around the fire with our loved ones. Every season puts itself to rest and a new one's born. But if summer stayed, we could rejoice and dance around forever. Yeah, we could... but for every thing, there's a season. That's what the Good Book says. What's that mean? Well, it means... we can't hang on to anything forever. Not even the summer. Our days on this earth are numbered, but if we live the good life and we're generous with our love, the sweetest season will follow. Rose, forgive me for barging in like this but honestly-- this child. How dare you go snooping around my bedroom. I wasn't snooping! Well, if this isn't snooping, then what is? I have been far too lenient with you. All I did was unwrap it! You opened a box that didn't belong to you. Well, you didn't want it. It was all dusty and sad, and it had my mom's writing on it. That's no excuse. You cannot take things that don't belong to you. It is so an excuse! And I wasn't taking it. I just wanted to see what she gave you. She made you the most beautiful sweater in the whole wide world, and you didn't even care enough to open it! Just lower your voice. I'm not sorry for what I did, either. Well, you just go back to the house and think about it until you are sorry, young lady. Thank you for the knitting class, Mama Rose. You're welcome, sweetheart. I'm sorry if she's been bothering you, Rose. Have a good night. Lettie? Why don't you sit a while, have a cup of tea? I heard all about how you've been acting but I just didn't want to believe it. It just didn't sound like you, Lettie. What's turned you so bitter? I cannot raise another child. The Lord wouldn't have sent her to you if He thought you weren't up to the task. He never sends us more than we can handle, isn't that right? If He likes you. Your sister gave you a precious gift. She trusted you with her child. I know how hard it was on you having to put your own life aside... but I also know how much it hurt when Alison left. Now you have Travis. Apparently I do. If you're feeling sorry for yourself, it's 'cause you closed the door on life. Joy is sitting on your doorstep, and you're ignoring it. Joy? I haven't had a moment's peace since "joy" arrived. Listen to yourself, Lettie Anderson. And remember this-- there's no greater reward on this earth than your own family. Think about it. Well, you're leaving us? You know, ah, last time somebody left here, Miss Lettie didn't eat or sleep for I don't know how long. I didn't think she'd ever recover. Well, she did. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I am. Yeah. Well, I guess you wrote her a note, huh? Mm-hmm. Well, what about me? You know, uh, you're supposed to give a week's notice before leaving a job. And, uh, what about my mama? And, uh, Samuel Madison? You see, around here, we say good-bye to our friends. But I guess it's different for you city girls, huh? Everybody's going to get a ten-page letter. Oh, well, great. But don't bother sending one to Tallulah. She's going to be too busy to miss you. Why? Well, she's having a little baby lamb this fall. For real? Yeah. What about the daddy? What about him? Is he staying? Yeah, of course he's staying. Why, he's out there bragging to the other sheep right this minute. Oh... 'Cause sometimes daddies get scared. What put that in your head? That's why my daddy didn't wait for me to get born. He got all nervous. One day my mom woke up and his side of the closet was empty. And she didn't even cry. You know why? No. 'Cause she wanted me more than anything in the world. Well, she would. And when I was born, she didn't even care that she was the only person in the hospital that didn't have flowers and balloons and stuff. Not even a visitor. She said she was all alone in the world, except for me. But it was worth it 'cause we'd be together for always. She should have phoned me or Miss Lettie. You're catching a cold, huh? : Yeah, it looks like it. Are you going to see Tallulah now? Yeah. Don't worry, I'll... I'll give her your regards. And when the little one comes, I'll send you a picture. But I want to see it up close. Oh, that ain't possible. How come? Oh, you're going to California. Oh. Well... I could turn around. Yeah, you could. Except... I'd have to stay with Miss Lettie and she doesn't want me here. Well, I can't speak for her, Travis, but I sure want you here. Are you telling me that that creep didn't even have the decency to marry her?! He didn't stick around long enough. Huh, so much for love at first sight. Alison had that baby all by herself. Why didn't she let us know? Why didn't she come home? Home is where she belongs. Poor Alison. Poor Travis. Where's everybody been anyway? We've been shopping. Isaiah? Well, he attempted to assist me, yes. What'd you get? Small clothes. I thought this would be lovely for your first day of school. A dress?! Yes, with... matching socks. What's this thing made of? Oh, that's pique. All the girls are wearing it. Why didn't you get any shorts? They're cheaper. Oh, well I got this jumper for you for casual wear. You can change the blouse. Is it okay if I go take a walk? All these dresses are making me dizzy. You're probably just not comfortable with more formal attire. Sure. I've never had firsthand clothes before, Miss Lettie. Thanks. You're welcome. Did you know that Mr. Madison is very, very fond of you? Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's recovered. Why do I have to go to school? Well, did you ever hear of algebra and geography? I've been in almost every single state. I'll just be wasting my time in school. And besides, it's terrible there. Who told you that? Miss Lettie. She says all the girls wear pique dresses. No disrespect, but it's been a long time since Miss Lettie and I were in school. Maybe the fashions have changed. Try telling Miss Lettie that. How is she anyway? Oh, she's great. And she's always watching baseball on TV. Really? And guess what? She has a picture of you in her scrapbook. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were a matchmaker. Did you take a look at that condo I told you about? Lettie'd hate living in a condo. Well, there's Meadow Wood. Sounds like a cemetery. Palm Court has a lovely retirement village. Ah, now, I like the sound of that. Why do you want to do such a foolish thing? It's too big for me. Well, this is a family farm. Well, I don't have a family. Well, what do you call Travis? A visitor. What about Alison? Gone, I call Alison gone. Well, the way Travis tells it, Alison's heart and soul is still here. Well, then why doesn't Alison come home and pick them up? Well, maybe she's afraid. Afraid of what? You. Me? Yeah. Yeah, the way you carried on telling her she'd never set foot in this house again if she dared go off with that boyfriend of hers. Oh, I wasn't serious. So what are you going to do, just kick that little girl out? Travis can stay with me as long as she needs to. In a retirement home? Village. It's a retirement village, not a home. Oh, you have lost your mind, selling off your heritage. It's my heritage, Isaiah. And it's my land and it's my business. Travis, why don't you tell us about yourself. I'm from Kenya; that's in Africa. My dad hunts snakes there. My mom flies him in a three-seater jet. It's only got three seats because the rest of the space is for the snake cages. Next year we're going to Florida. We're going to be living in this houseboat with our pet flamingos. It'll be great seeing my family again. Mama. I'm fine. Mama. I'm fine. Oh, Mama. You shouldn't be cleaning up all day. Come on, I want you to rest now. Oh. Mama, you look tired. I'll finish up for you. Ms. Anderson used to say I could get more work done in one afternoon than anybody she'd ever seen. Those days are behind me now. I've been on this farm 75 years. I can't imagine it going to strangers. But Lettie's determined to sell. Mama, I tried to talk to her. Oh, son, you got to be patient with Lettie. It can't be easy on her carrying a stone around her heart. You have a wonderful gift for storytelling, just like your mother. Do you know my mom? Mm-hmm, we went to high school together. For real? We were absolutely inseparable. We were, too. Could I have her address? I'd love to write and... We never have addresses, just PO Box numbers. You must miss her. Uh-huh. Me, too. When she comes for me, you should quit your job and come with us. Every day's a new adventure. What are you doing here? I come to drive you home. But I'm going to the drug store. I've got responsibilities. Oh, no. Miss Lettie wants me to drive you straight home. Why, so she can get mad at me if I touch a Mahjongg plate? No... So you can do your homework. Homework?! Now don't blame me. Okay, I'm just following instructions. But what about my customers? They need me. Travis, I know somebody who needs you a lot more than your customers. Who? We lost Tallulah. What do you mean "lost"? She passed on. Died? Yeah. But... We took good care of her, didn't we, Isaiah? We sure did, Travis. She wasn't sick or anything. It was just her time. But she was my friend. I know. I can tell you something you can do for Tallulah. This little girl needs help, and I think you're just the one to take care of her. Orphan? Listen-- You come here this minute! Orphan! Orphan! Orphan. Orphan. No! Orphan. Children! Children! I'll see you in my office, young lady. Oh... Isaiah, where'd you hide my keys? What keys? Car keys. Your car keys? Want me to drive? I do not. Want me to back it up for you? Hey! Whoa! Take it easy with that. Now, come on, let me drive the car. I cannot concentrate with all this yakking. Oh, my... Have you been warming this car up every morning? Yes, Ma'am. You're sure? Yes, Ma'am. For ten minutes? Yes, Ma'am. You're certain of that. Yes, Ma'am. Well, then, what's wrong with it? I said it's not in gear. Come on, now, let me... Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it, now. Oh, put the thing in reverse. Come one, put it in reverse. It was in reverse. Now it's in reverse and it's not going. Now, put the thing in reverse. Somebody hasn't been oiling this car. Yes, Ma'am. Take it easy, now. Easy. Take it easy. Hold it, hold it, take it easy. Don't... Whoa, whoa, take it easy. Hold, Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't go stomping on that gas pedal, now. Take it easy. Whoa! Easy! Hey, watch that fence. What on earth were you thinking of, bringing this animal to school? He's not an animal-- he's my pet. Yeah, well. You and Fido are in big trouble. I can promise you, Travis won't be bringing any more animals to school. Actually, I'm glad we've had a chance to talk. I am concerned about Travis. Well, I will see to it that she studies further if she's behind. It's not a matter of studying. Travis is bright, but her mind... It seems to be somewhere else. Oh, yes, of course, it is. She's worried about Alison. When a child is separated from her mother, it's very difficult. Well, she said that Alison would be here any minute. Well, I'm afraid she's in for a disappointment. I don't think Alison has any intention of coming back here. Want me to steer? No, thank you. You ought to get a truck like Isaiah's. They go faster. Well, unlike Isaiah, I follow the speed limit. You're 12 miles under. You know, I bet driving's made you thirsty. You know what we should do? We should stop and visit Mr. Madison and get a soda. Nonsense. What's nonsense about it? You're being punished, remember? What's that got to do with it? He'd like to see you. Where do you get these absurd notions? He's always talking about you. Yeah, well, that's all he ever was-- talk. It's not too late. For what? Isaiah says there's hope for you yet. Well, you can tell Isaiah something for me. He had no right to give you this lamb. Why? Because it belongs to me! Well, you don't want it. That's beside the point! Isaiah! Isaiah Griffin, where are you?! Why is he never around when I need him? All right young lady. You put that lamb in the barn and you go to your room. Come on, Mama, now, you got to eat. Come on, Ma. Come on. I'm too tired. You watch over things... while I sleep. She had a good, long life. I know. Her end was peaceful. We can take comfort in that. I guess. We were so lucky to have her as a friend. But Isaiah doesn't have a mother now. Oh, well... Isaiah is strong. He'll manage. He'll still feel bad. A person without a mom always feels lonesome inside. Yes, I suppose that's right. Isaiah's mama had bones that could talk. Did you know that? I did not. They told her when it was going to rain. Really? I'm not going to cry today. Do you know why? Because where she is, it's winter and she's sitting by a fire with people she loved. Did Mama Rose... teach you that? Uh-huh. She taught me tons. She taught us both tons. And I'm not going to forget any of it, either. Even if I get amnesia, I'll still remember her. I wish Mama Rose were here. She'd know how to fix this mess, and then she could tell us the rest of the secret about Miss Lettie and Mr. Madison. That sardine can of yours is a beauty. Yeah. Well, I don't let nobody drive too close to me. How's the engine? Smoother than your homemade ice cream. Sweeter, too. Yep. Well, you could get a pretty penny for this truck if you ever want to sell it. No, no, it ain't for sale. I don't blame you. You ever change your mind, let me know. Oh, no, no. I'm going to be buried in my sardine can. Anybody who says, "You can't take it with you" is in for a big surprise. I'll see you later, friend. All right. Well, find a buyer? Don't be ridiculous. I'm not selling this farm. What's the matter with you, Isaiah? Next thing you know, you'll be suggesting that I move to a retirement village. Want me to get rid of this for you? Yeah. Would you? Yeah. You taking off on Thursday? Well, it's Thanksgiving. That's what I thought. All right, I'll drive by in the morning. And in the afternoon you'll celebrate by overeating, won't you? Well, don't you come complaining to me about your indigestion and your ever expanding waistline. I won't. Well, you gonna be having a fine Thanksgiving dinner. Is that right? Yeah. I taught Travis how to bake my famous sweet potato pie. Oh, well, that's all we need, huh? And turkey with corn bread dressing. She already made a batch of cranberry sauce. Listen, Isaiah, Thanksgiving is pretty much the same as any other day. She wants to surprise you. So, on Thursday, try to wipe that sour expression off your face and be grateful. Think you can do that? I think I know how to comport myself, Isaiah, and I don't need any lessons from you. Don't ruin it for her. I have no intention of ruining anything for anybody. You mean it was love? As a matter of fact, I was in love with her, yes. We were engaged. You mean to get married? Mm-hmm. What happened? Well, Lettie was, uh... She had a lot of responsibilities with a family, taking care of them. Said she was too busy for romance. You could have gotten married without all the "romance." I wanted to, but... that's when the offer came. You mean to play baseball? Uh-huh. Mama Rose said you were famous. Well, that was hometown famous. She could have gone with you! You should have just asked her. I did ask her over and over. After a while, I gave up hope. You never forget your first love. Orphan. Orphan! Orphan! Orphan, don't eat the biscuits. What is go... I can fix it! Ah! Aah! You get this animal out of here... now! Or else! A... lamb in the kitchen?! Biscuits on the floor?! Miss Lettie is going to turn Orphan into lamb chops! Oh, she'll do no such thing. We don't slaughter our sheep. This is a wool farm. So, stop moaning and groaning. No time for tears. We've got sweet potato pies to bake. I don't care what day it is. A lamb has no business prancing around the kitchen. But it's her pet. It's a commodity! I am trying to run a farm here. You want me to buy the lamb from you? I'll buy it. How much do you want? Isaiah, that's not the point. Oh, no, no, the point is Travis loves something and you want to ruin it for her. Oh... I mean, just because love gave you a black eye doesn't mean it's gonna do the same to Travis. What are you babbling about? About you! Me? Uh-huh. About how scared you are. You don't think I see through you? You think I would have stayed here all these years if I would have believed that you were as nasty as you act? You've overstepped the line, Isaiah. No, I'm just talking the truth. But let me tell you something. Look around! You're not the only one who's lost somebody they loved. I'm aware of that. Travis is aching for a family. And in case you haven't noticed, you don't have a whole lot of years left in you. Is that so? Yes, ma'am, it is. The child doesn't need me. But you are family. That little girl cares for you. What you gonna do about it? Listen... I don't want to be standing in that.... churchyard, bawling over a woman who wasted her final years. When I laid my mama to rest, her passing was peaceful. You know why? 'Cause she had no regrets. But I look at you and that's all I see is regrets. Regrets and a bad- tempered, old woman! I mean, it's... it's Thanksgiving day. Maybe you ought to think of something to be.... thankful for. My! Isn't everything beautiful? It's lovely. I've never had a real Thanksgiving. Well, I think it's time you had one and I got an idea. The Andersons always had our Thanksgivings dinner in the dining room. What do we say we eat in there? Do you have a fever? It's not Mahjongg day. A guest! A guest? Ta-da! Afternoon, ladies. Travis, set another place at the table and find me the crystal glasses. Did you notice Miss Lettie's cheeks are nice and pink today? Oh, please. Yeah, she's prettier than Yankee Stadium on a Sunday afternoon. Well, your compliments haven't improved with age. "Stadium"? Your cooking certainly has. Oh, well, now, Travis is the chef in this family. She and Isaiah planned the whole dinner. Is that so? Mr. Madison made this batch special. Cinnamon vanilla. You remembered! Uh-huh. Just like old times, huh? You watch that first step, Sam. Right. Well, if you want any ice cream... I'll be glad to deliver it. Well, that's good to know. Good night. And last night I heard her singing. No. Mr. Madison likes her a lot. I knew I was right. Uh... I've been, um, thinking over the lamb situation, and, um, I don't think I could get a penny for her, so... why don't you keep her, Travis. You know what that was? What? That was an apology. We've only got two weeks to get ready for our Christmas program. We're going to need a manger, costumes and some volunteers for the cast. I'm always one of the Wise Men. Ah. Oh! I remember this. The church picnic. Yes. I'm an angel! I'm an angel! I get to have wings and a halo and everything! And Isaiah is the wisest of the Wise Men. We get to star in the Nativity scene. Stupendous, huh? Yes! I don't think the Christmas story is ever going to be the same. What... what are you doing? You gonna break your neck. Isaiah, where did you hide my Christmas ornaments? Christmas ornaments? Yes, that's what I said. You retired those years ago, told me to throw them out. I did not. Yes, you did. Oh... Well, there's got to be more than this. Well, there is, maybe. And, listen, get your ax. What do I need my ax for? To cut down a tree. A what? A Christmas tree! Isaiah, what's the matter with you? : That stone heart is starting to beat again. We have Mary, Joseph, our shepherd boy and our Wise Men. Something's missing. Travis... we need our star angel. Fear not... So, what did Alison write you? Nothing. Well, maybe your mama will phone you on Christmas day. No, she won't. She hasn't called once. I bet she's even forgotten how to use the telephone. And her name's Mom, not Mama. Don't you know anything? You got to keep hoping. 'Cause if you want to something, you got to believe it can happen. I don't want to believe anymore. All right, then I'll do the believing for both of us. I'm never seeing my mom again. Well, who told you that? I just know, okay? Well, listen... I know some things, too. I guess you forgot who you're talking to. I'm the wisest of the Wise Men, remember? Wow... It's beautiful. You want to help? Okay. Go ahead. Ah, that's perfect. Christmas makes people nice, huh? Yes. How was rehearsal today? I flubbed all my lines. Isaiah just rolled his eyes. Oh... But don't worry. I'll know all my lines by that night, you'll see. I have no doubt. You're coming, aren't you? You want me there? Everybody else will have family there. Who will clap for me, Miss Lettie? "And so it was that while they were there, "the days were accomplished that she should be delivered, "and she brought forth her firstborn son "and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger "because there was no room for them in the inn. "And there were, in the same country "shepherds abiding in the field "keeping watch over their flock by night. "And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them "and the glory of the Lord shone 'round about them "and they were so afraid. "And the angel said unto them... "And the angel said "unto them... 'Fear not, for behold, I bring good tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people.' "For unto you is born this day "in the city of David, a savior which is Christ the Lord." Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Hey, take it easy. You going to wake the chickens. Merry Christmas, Isaiah. Merry Christmas. What are you doing up so early? Well, you try to keep a child quiet on Christmas morning. What are you driving this old thing for? "Old"? That's my brand new third-hand green bean. What happened to the Sardine Can? Well... I sold her. What? Yeah, well... I needed a change. Besides, I thought we'd fix this one up together, me and you. Looks kind of sad. Yeah, well, that's because it's not used to doing early-morning chores like we are. Come on. I made a present for you. Uh-huh. It's wearable. That's nice. And it's soft and squishy. Mmm. Must be a marshmallow. No, it's red. What color's my present? You'll see... You and Miss Lettie. You got us the same thing? Yep. Better not be Mahjongg stuff. I'm going to bring it over after breakfast. Breakfast? Yeah. That'll take forever. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas to you. You look really pretty. Thank you. Your mother's sweater. How come I have so much? Well, some are from Santa. Some are from Isaiah, and some are from me. This is for you. For me? It's a scarf. I made it to go with that sweater. So it is a scarf-- you did this? You made it yourself? It's beautiful. Thank you. And... this is for you. No pique. And... this is for Orphan. Now Orphan will have a little sister to play with while I go to school. Yeah. Oh, this is the merriest Christmas ever, Aunt Lettie. Oh, honey, isn't it just. Thank you. Hey... Look. Look it, Isaiah. Your present's waiting for you. Oh, thank you. Wow. It's for your head. Oh, well, of course. Of course it is. Look it here. Wow... Look at that, huh? Now... I'll get you your present, okay? Mom! I missed you. I missed you, too. Oh, I knew you'd come. I knew it. Didn't I, Isaiah? I never gave up hoping, not for one second. Travis... now you got to share with Miss Lettie now, okay? Aunt Lettie, look who's here. Oh... Alison. It's... it's so good to see you. I missed you so much, Aunt Lettie. You're home. You're home. You're home. Mom, Mom... you got to meet Orphan. Yes, go, go, meet Orphan. She looks beautiful, doesn't she? Yes, yes, she do. Did you sell your truck to bring Alison home? What are you talking about? Don't you get coy with me. I don't want to hear any of that "Oh, I needed a change." I can't believe you got rid of your beloved Sardine Can for me. For you? Where did you get that idea? No, no, no. I did it for my church. See, we needed a choir director, and the only person I could think of that was right for the job was Alison. Yeah, that's it. Oh, you are a dear friend. That Christmas night, all the lost lambs in the world had been found. I truly could hear heaven and nature singing.
