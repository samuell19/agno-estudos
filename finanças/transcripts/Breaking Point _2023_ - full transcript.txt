I thought you weren't gonna miss any more lessons. And where were you last night, anyway? First period doesn't start till nine. Late, again. And school's not the only thing you've been missing out on lately, is it? Remember? You were supposed to cover for me at the antiques fair last Saturday and help out your Uncle Roy. He says you bailed on him. That's a lie. No, no, no. Come on. That's not on. You must apologise. OK. Dad... I'm sorry. Not to me! To your Uncle Roy. Nah, Roy's an absolute tool, man. Come on. Don't say that. Come on. Hi! Well, hello, Layla. Morning, Martin. You alright, mate? Boom. Sup? Are you hungry? Yes, please. Our fridge was empty. Well, help yourself to whatever's in there and then, the two of you, get a move on. Is there anything you wanna say to your dad before you go? Anything at all? Not today. Thanks. "Happy birthday, Dad!" would be nice. Last night was lit. Come on! Help me figure out this stupid website so we can actually get into uni. That one. OK. What is that noise? Rampage Crew. I heard they've got a show at that big club. Literally everyone's going. I don't care. As long as Benji comes to Dad's birthday later. Are we unpopular? Abbie, you're one of the most intelligent people I know. I'm sure you can work out the answer to that question. Yeah, but I mean, we're not really. I mean, we're not like them. No, they have three friends, we have one. Yeah, but through choice. I wouldn't call that unpopular. I'd just call that... exclusive. Yeah, we're smashing it. Erm, excuse me? Yeah, you in the Christmas jumper. Could you pick that up, please? Thank you. Thank you. Put it straight in the bin. Yeah. Actually, is that paper? It should go in the recycling. Don't roll your eyes at me. In there. Brilliant. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day. Also, it's March. Take it off. Check the video I've got. What, last night's clip? Yeah, bro. Benji, you're popping off, man. Socials are blowing up. Mm-hmm. We're selling out tonight. Yeah, but check out my drop right here. Yeah, you were killing it last night, to be fair. Can Layla do this, though? Allow her, man. Benji Matthews! That's enough showing off. Come on. With me. Now! - Aw, Miss. - You're good, bro. Let me know how it goes, man. Shut up. Mr Matthews. Mrs Laverty. Thank you for coming in at such short notice. Benji and his Rampage Crew were caught on college grounds last night. They were trespassing, breaking and entering, and vandalising. Unfortunately, I have no option but to issue a two-week suspension. Mrs Laverty, I can only apologise. You. With me, now. This is so out of order. We have been through this. I've been too soft on you. From now on, you pay your own way. Phone, rent, food, everything, and don't you dare think about bailing. Fine but can't I start tomorrow? I've got practice later. - No, you don't. - It's important, - I can't miss it! - No more dancing, Benji. You are done! And so am I. Breaking. You, get there now and help your uncle! Quickly! I just don't know where I've gone wrong with him. You're doing alright. It's hard. You're doing it by yourself. Er, easy with that chair, mate. Thanks for being here, man. That's what family's for.

I'm scouting for breakers to invite to try out for the world championship, so give it your best shot. Erm, alright. Bye-bye.' You're considering it, aren't you? No, he isn't. He'd never leave the crew behind. Right, Benj? Ah! Got ya! You think you're funny, innit? I thought I was gonna have to find a new breaker, bro. No chance. I'm the best there is. 'Hi, this is Kate Robson here.' Benji, listen, I'm sorry about earlier. I was... Oh. You're not there. OK. I brought you some hot chocolate. Can you call your brother, please? - I don't have his number. - Why not? Cos I have nothing to say to him. And if I did, he wouldn't wanna hear it anyway. Right, I'm sure that, during the course of your life, a situation will arise where you will need to call your brother. He's not my brother. What? He's adopted! Oh, my silk pyjamas!

We should be together as a family. Or have you forgotten what that is cos you've been... A family? You can't just pick and choose when I'm a part of this family. These guys are more of a family to me anyways. It's not our fault you'd much rather spend your time hanging around with a bunch of idiot kids who think you're cool cos you can backflip.

I never wanted- Get over it! It was years ago. Now, get out, will ya? I said get out. Whoa, whoa, whoa. None of that. If you wanna battle, you do it on the floor. You heard the man. You come in here, play by our rules. This is hilarious but I think that's our cue. Fine. What? You come home. Trey, what the hell are you doing? You can't breakdance. Do you wanna run home to Daddy or do you actually wanna do this? Let's just get it over with. It looks like we've got a battle on our hands, people! Alright, Benji, let's make this quick.

Excuse me, sorry. My best friend, Trey Matthews. Good morning, Trey Matthews. My best friend, Trey Matthews. Hello. What's going on? OK, you're not gonna believe this, but we're popular now. Like, like, actually popular. See, everyone saw that video of you destroying Benji and... I didn't destroy him. Shh! That's not how everyone else saw it. No photos, no photos. Make sure they get your good side. Very important for the press. OK, you've gone viral on social media. I'm not on social media. You are now. I made you an account. Abbie! No, delete it. No. Serious. Delete it. No. I've got followers now. Trey, I've never had followers before. It's all very, very exciting. You know, we could've been popular this whole time. Trey, we could've gone to parties. Everyone thought we were losers, when we're secretly cooler than all of them... I'm gonna go. This whole time. We... We are cooler than all of you. Well, specifically me... Trey? Next stop, Durham University. "You have one new voicemail from Kate." 'Hi. If you're hearing this, then you've been selected to try out for Team GB. Auditions are tomorrow at my studio in Liverpool, so please make sure you're at the hotel for registration at 9AM sharp.' What? 'Good luck.' Oh, there he is. First Matthews boy to go to university. I haven't got in yet. Well, I know you will. Ah, good afternoon, Benji. That's one glass of juice. Make sure that you add it to my monthly tab. I don't know how you're gonna pay this monthly tab without any income. Look at your brother there, going to Durham University. Typical. The miracle child can do no wrong. So, apart from your interview, did anything else exciting happen today? Not really. You? Not really. I did get a call from this random woman, though. That's weird, cos I got a call from a random woman too. Yeah, but I'm not actually gonna go. I've got way more important things - to be doing. - So do I. What random woman? Who are you guys messaging? You better not have made anyone pregnant, I swear to God. Oh, my God... My best friend's gonna be a world champion. Are you gonna mention me? Actually, no. Can I be your manager? I'm not gonna do it. Wha... Wha... Are you doolally? I'd be doolally if I went. Trey, you can't turn down an opportunity like this. It would be outrageous. I don't break. Not in front of people, and definitely not competitively. Why? Benji's the breaker. That's his thing. I'm going to uni. I'm gonna... You can do both. Who says you have to do just one thing? I wouldn't make it through the first round, anyway. OK, but, you know, if you did... you'd be, like, famous. And I would be your famous best friend. Yeah, I'd be a great famous person. I actually practise in front of the mirror all the time. Ready? Hold on. Oh, no. No photos. This is me getting papped. Inspiring stuff. Thank you. But I'm not going. And that's final.

I can't believe we've got to share a room. It's weird that they've even put us together, anyway. I don't mind. 'Benji, bro, is this what we're doing now? Just missing rehearsals? Did you forget what I said about us being a crew? If you and Layla don't pull up tomorrow, I'm gonna have to replace both of you. Nothing personal. In a bit.' You were shortlisted for the world championships. I'm sure they'll get over it. Are you dumb? I wouldn't be surprised if they chucked us out the crew. Would that be such a bad thing? You and Layla can start a new crew. If I want advice about breaking, you're the last person I'd ask. I was just trying to help. Yeah? Well, I didn't ask for it. After what you pulled at ReVault?

Good enough to win the world championships. I mean, that set did win the world championships when B-Boy D-Lux won it two years ago. He's a big inspiration to me. So, you're inspired by other breaker's sets. We call that biting. I know what biting is. But doing his sets, it calms me down. It's the only reason I'm still breaking at all. Talent is all about origination, not imitation, OK? Understood. Word of advice, whatever's going on between you and Benji, park it. - It's nothing. - What I saw at ReVault was not nothing. And it's a silly thing to let ruin this opportunity for you both. Trust me, I've been there. And you don't wanna end up like me. Come on. The day isn't over yet. ♪ MAN GWANANI: Sizokhanya ♪ I'm just gonna be honest, what exactly has this got to do with breaking? Well, the more attuned breakers among us have figured out why we're here. Musicality. In breaking, the ability to follow the rhythm and tempo in music is key. And it's something I look for in all my breakers. I want you guys to try. Everyone get in. Come on, Noel. Nice! Well done, everyone. Great first day. Moves like Jagger! Bruv, this ain't real breaking. I didn't sign up for this. Shut up, Noel. Good morning, everyone. So, there is an element that I wanna focus on. Any guesses? Trust. Do you trust the people in here? Cos if there's no trust, there's no crew. You two, partner up. I don't think that's a good... No, I don't care. Partner up. Erm... you guys. Er, you, you. Partner up. Alright, find a spot and face each other. OK, it's all about eye contact. Hold out your hands. Keeping the eye contact and taking a step back. No giggling. That's it. Keeping the eye contact. Take another step back. Right. And another step... Keep eye contact. What are you playing at? It was an accident. An accident? Bro, are you joking me? Is this cos we're done being brothers, yeah? Yeah, it may as well be. Bro, we never was brothers. You can't even break. Benji, stop. Benji. What are you even doing here? That's enough now. Hey! Guys, guys, guys. No, no, no. Mandem! No fighting in here. No! Pattern up! We're supposed to be training! If we had a proper coach, he'd be doing drills with us, perfecting our moves, doing something that's gonna help us win. So, you don't like my training? Since you brought it up, no. What we need is someone that can actually break. Something other than their own leg. Woah, chill out. That's too far. What do you mean, too far? Show the lady respect. What do you mean? I give respect to people who give it to me. I'm trying to train! I'm trying to be the best! Who's trying to be the best? Put your hand in the air if you're trying to be the best. OK, everyone, with your hands in the air... get out, you're done. Cool. Very cool. Some madness. We don't need it, bro. If you lot knew anything about this, you'd get rid of her. And him. What's he even doing here? Hey! Don't forget about my money. Shut up, bruv. Do your press-ups, - bro. - Oh, you need a hug. Pathetic! Alright, everyone, settle down. For the rest of you, get changed and join me by the stairs. Hey, sorry. Could everyone wait a second? Can I have everyone's attention? Come through and gather round, please. Well done. That was really hard. Really hard. Erm... Successful breakers will be contacted in the next few hours, so don't go too far. Those who make it, I'll see you in the morning. Off you go. Well, this is... fun, isn't it? I don't think the three of us have all hung out together since Junior. Dad's losing it. Have you messaged him? Why would I? He's made it quite clear how he feels about me breaking. We really messed it up for the crew, huh? Did we get kicked out? Course we did. There's no going back now. We should have heard by now. Such a waste of time. Been kicked out of the crew for nothing. Guys, it's not the end of the world if you don't... It's not the end of your world. None of this matters to you. After all this, you get to run off to uni and be the perfect son. Do you know how it feels to be the outcast of this family? It's Dad. What do I say? I don't care. He's calling you, not me. Hi, Dad. "Hi, Dad." I know, sorry. We're kind of... in Liverpool? What? We're coming back when we... When you what? We knew you wouldn't... Let you go to Liverpool? Maybe I would've if you'd let me know what the hell you were doing there in the first place. You boys never tell me anything! We're all together. Layla's here too. We're fine. Honestly. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yes! - - Oh, my God! - Trey? Trey? - We've gotta stay in Liverpool tonight. I'll call you in the morning to explain, I promise. Did what? We made the team. Yeah! What's going on? Did you... Trey? Look, call the... Hello? Boys. I... Don't you worry about me. I'm just enjoying this little display. It's nice to see some hugging instead of fighting. Yes! Yes! We did it. OK. Well, you're a crew now. So, get to know each other, for better, for worse. These guys are out here together every day, no matter what. So, go on, get in there. - Alright. - I'm sure they can teach you a thing or two. ♪ RAT BOY: Move ♪ Alright, let's go! ♪ Well, you know I never say the same thing twice OK! ♪ Well, you know, ♪ I never say the same thing twice If I pulse about in the headlight...

As I was saying, one of you will be on the bench and I know it's not where any of you wanna be, but if there is an injury, you'll be what keeps us in the competition. You're not here for a holiday. You're here to be the best breakers that you could possibly be. Are you ready to show that to the world? Yeah. Yes? Yeah! OK! Have a safe journey home and I'll see you in London. Can't believe we made it. Catch you later, my G. Hey, hopefully, we'll all see each other soon. Hey, Trey. Come on, man. We got a bus to catch. I cannot believe you boys would do something like this without telling me. What have you got to say for yourselves? Huh? We were at try-outs for the world championships. Any other parent would be proud. Of what? A college dropout and a straight-A student who wants to throw his life away to spin on his head? It's more than that, Dad. Don't throw your future away, Trey. You're better than this. Better than me, you mean? Listen, I want what's best for you! If you just applied yourself and worked as hard as your brother here, maybe... I didn't get into Durham! I-I froze up in the interview. Sorry to disappoint you. No way. Benji! Benj! I'm the reserve? How was I not in the top seven? I mean, come on. How have you made the team and I haven't? You don't care about breaking. Come on, that's not true. What? Cos you've thrown everything else away and this is all you've got left? What's going on? Hello? I made the team. Oh, that's great. Oh. Look, I'm sorry. No, get off. Don't touch me! You don't get it!

They eat 'em alive. So, so, so, so, we start with the quarter-final against Team USA. And then, we'll be on to the semis. I know it's intimidating, but stay calm. You deserve to be here. And remember what the judges are looking for. Musicality... ..personality and character. Yes! Tell your story! The composition of your rounds is key. Every time you move between floor work, power moves and top rocks, there must be a clear flow to it. A reason behind everything you're doing and... I don't care if you can do a one-handed airflare into a jackhammer with your eyes closed. Trey, it's your boy. None of it matters if you don't have a clean, powerful execution. And remember, keep it original. I don't wanna see any repeats cos that's what the judges will be looking out for. Are you alright? You got this, OK? Come on, guys. Like, can you blame him? OK, everyone, let's get over to the arena. Guys! Hey! Here we are! We made it! OK, don't worry about anyone else in this room. OK? We got this. OK, Deb, so what's your experience been like coaching the French team recently? Obviously, this is early days in my tenure as coach, but, you know, we're in a good place. The most important lesson I try and instil in them is to focus their energy solely on themselves, not those around them, no matter the competition. Thanks for chatting with us, Deb. Alright. Well, thanks very much and good luck out there. Break a leg. ♪ Sh-shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay... ♪ Are you ready for the World Breaking Championships? Yo! Carla and Pete here and we are on the cusp of the semi-final of the Breaking World Championships. So, the underdogs, Team GB, have beaten fan favourites, Team USA in an impressive display of raw talent. If they want to progress to the semi-finals against a ridiculously organised Japan, they're gonna need to embrace teamwork over raw individual talent. Kind of like me and you, eh, Pete? Exactly right. Argh and that D-Lux is something else and honestly, I can't see anybody getting close to France. Hey, so this is what Trey's been doing? The world championship. So, it's a pretty big deal? Whoever wins is the champion of the world in breaking. So, yeah. - Pretty big deal. - Why don't we go together? That would be fun. I'm supposed to be there as - an injury reserve. - That's great! No, it's not. I can't just go there and sit on a bench, watch them all do what I'm supposed to be doing. What happens if one of them... gets injured and you're not there? I told you already, I'm not going. You said I'm not allowed to break anymore, and now you're trying to tell me to go. Which is it? Your mother was so much better at this than me. I'm not her, Benji. Hi, Benji. Look, you are our first reserve and we really need you right now. Erm, call me back once you get this.

Exactly. It just... It doesn't feel right without Benji. What makes you say that? It's just that, the last and only time I competed without him was... was the day that... Mum died. Come on, let's go and get some air. I think you might be over-thinking this. You're living in your head and... that, my friend, can be dangerous. You know, I used to have a breaking partner. Yeah? Yeah. We grew up breaking together. She was like a sister to me. She was precise like you are and I had flair like Benji. What happened? Well, I ruined it. I became so obsessed with trying to one up her. I literally broke myself trying to prove that I was better than her. I cost us our crew, my career and our friendship. Look, you and Benji are great breakers. But I cannot, in my right mind, put you both in this team. I saw too much of myself in the both of you and... you need to learn how to support and... and galvanise each other in a way that I wasn't able to do. Your nerves and his ego are holding you both back. Figure that out and then, wow. There's no limit to what you can achieve. I pick the best breakers to win. You're in a crew now. Remember that. We are live here at the semi-finals where Team GB are about to go head to head with Team Japan. Come on, Team GB! We believe! But before that, let's head back to the arena for the first semi results between the juggernaut that is Team France and the scrappy Team Sweden. Judges! What's the verdict? France are through to the finals! There we have it. A sweeping victory for Team France. B-Boy, D-Lux, what have you gotta say for yourself? And there we have it. Team France make the finals. Moving on, Team GB are up next in the semi-final against Japan. Team GB are the underdogs here. This should be interesting. Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the semi-finals between Team Japan and Team GB. Are you ready, B-boys and B-girls? Let's do this! Oh, here they come! It's the semi-finals!

Let's make some space for the paramedics. We're done. We need a medic over here! Benji? Nah, it's done. Can't believe it. 'Dad, I know being around me isn't easy. You're the best dad I could possibly ask for and I know I've let you down over and over again. I'm sorry if I haven't been good enough for you, but that changes today. Gone to the Championships.' Oh! 'I hope I can make you and Mum proud. And I hope one day... you can forgive me. Benji.' It's nice to see you, Benji. You too, Coach. Let's not waste any more time. It's now down to the judges. Judge one. Ooh, and it's one to Team GB! Come on! Yes, GB, yes! Er, sorry, guys, absolutely no bias here. This is so intense. OK, judge number two is about to reveal his decision. Judge two. And it's Japan! OK, we're still in this. It all lies in this final vote. Judge three, what's it gonna be? Come on, you know it makes sense. I knew they would, bruv. These lot are the best. Go on. Go on. Let's go, man. Let's go. Here we go. Come on, man. It's alright. Come on. And now, it all comes down to this, the final judge. Here we go. Yes! And it's GB! That's official. Well done, everyone. Well done! You guys performed excellently. What do you have to say for yourselves? OK, so that's it then. The finals will be Team GB against the immovable Team France, to find out, once and for all, who the best of the best is. This is a huge showdown. Former partners turned rivals, Team France's Debs comes face to face with Team GB's Kate. D-Lux and them guys. It's gonna be a hard battle. It'll be alright. French fries, remember? And now, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the final! Here come the teams. The French team looking confident as always. Team GB are now joined by the injury reserve, Benji Matthews.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, teams, settle down. The judges will not be impressed. This is some serious foul play. - It's getting out of hand. - Not sure if the judges will like that. They do not look happy. This is some serious foul play from both sides. Such a shame to end the tournament on such a downer. Let's see what the judges have to say. What the hell was that? You tried to trip me! No, I didn't! Yes, you did! Stop! Stop! Stop! What is your problem? You could have got us disqualified cos of all this fighting. He started it! He couldn't handle me showing him up, so he tried to trip me. What sort- Stop and actually listen to somebody for once! Don't you see what you're doing? You're destroying the crew and your family! You just had to be the centre of attention. Was it worth it to let the whole crew down again? I get why Rampage Crew dumped you now. Hey. You didn't have to come - all this way. - Oh, course I did. Right, so what actually happened then? Same thing that always happens. OK, so you did a head spin and everyone got mad? This was all my fault. Because of the head spin? OK, I'm sorry. I'll be serious. Cos I came for the wrong reasons. I wanted to prove something. Prove what? That I could. I thought if I showed Benji I was just as good as him, we could be brothers as again. Instead I just pushed everyone away. You don't have anything to prove, Trey. Look, honestly, you're one of the best people I know. You could never push me away. I know. Listen, there's something I need to tell you about uni. I didn't get in. I know I should've said something earlier, I just... I didn't wanna lose what we have. You are literally the only person on the whole planet that I can actually talk to. Well, you're a bit of a cliche, sitting alone on the steps. That was tough to watch out there yesterday. - What do you want, Debs? - God, you really do despise me, don't you? Sorry, I've got a lot on mind. It's not about you, really. See, this is your problem. You always thought I was trying to make it about me but I wasn't. You put that on me. You did. What, I did? You forced me out of the crew. I didn't, you did that on your own. I didn't want you to leave. Anyway, I see the same thing happening with those boys. Right, so it's my fault now, is it? Sorry, have you just come out here to gloat? I'm trying to help you. Stop taking everything as a personal attack. So... why are you trying to help me? Those boys are good. There's potential there. And you're their coach, so don't let it go to waste. So, what are you saying? Think about it. Hey, bring your A game. Dad! Hello. Aw. I came to see how you boys are. Did you see what happened? Yes. I just wanted to make you proud of me, for once. I couldn't even do that. Hey. I am proud of you, OK? But it breaks me when you guys fight. You see, it's like I've failed. Mum would be upset. You know the thing she was most proud of? It was seeing her boys doing the thing they love together. So, whatever happens... as long as you are together... that's all that matters. The competition officials have declared a no-contest between Team GB and Team France. We aren't 100% certain what this means. But in the break... OK. OK. This just in. Breaking news. To decide a winner, there'll be tiebreaker between two individual breakers. A solo battle. Team France have selected, B-boy D-Lux, and Team GB, in a surprising turn of events, have selected B-boy Benji. Benji! Benji! I got your text. What's the emergency? Well, talk. That's all I wanted to do. I just wanna talk. You mean argue? I'm not doing this again. If it wasn't for me, we'd still be a family. What? So this is just a quick chat - in the gym? - Oh, Trey, listen, man! It was my fault. I'm the reason Mum got distracted in the car. She turned around because of me. Where's all this coming from? Mum didn't die because of you. Don't. I insisted on doing that stupid competition without you. I'm the reason we were even in the car. I'm the reason we were arguing. That was me. You don't blame me? Why would I blame you? Cos it was my fault. So, let's figure out how to fix this. We both know I can't beat D-Lux. No one can. You see, that's true, but you know him better than anyone. So, if I'm gonna stand a fighting chance... I need your help. A'ight, a'ight, a'ight. So you know what he's gonna do next, right? Bro, he's gonna hit you with airflares. Airflare, rollback, one-hand freeze. As soon as you see him rollback, hit the freeze at the same time. Just steal his round, yeah? So, he's gonna go airflare... Yeah? Get it? As soon as you see him, rollback, freeze. Yeah? Trey, Trey, stop. This isn't right. Bro, it has to be you. What? In fact, it needs to be you. You know his every move. Nobody's studied him more than you. Yeah, cool, he might not have lost in a while, but our best chance is with you. No, bro, you're the freestyler. You know I can't do it. You just did it. Of course you can do it. This is your moment, man. Come on. A'ight, so how do we do this? Let's just take the piss. What? Hm. You hit him in his face with that signature. Laugh at him and he'll crumble on stage. No one does that to D-Lux. - Yeah? Confidence. - Yeah. But once you've done that, bro, all you need to do is let go. - Be free. - That's... No. No, no, no. Be free in the moment. Remember what Kate said? Musicality. Bro, everything that's happening around you, own it. Come on, man. Dance with me. Let's have a little one. Come on. These are your basics, bro. - Cross step. - A'ight. Add some character. Arms. Don't think, just flow. OK.Show me! OK.Show me! Yeah, that's simple. Now make it your own. Make it your own without even thinking. Remember the basics. Never forget the basics of how we move. Use your hands, bro. Come on! That's it. That's it. Now use some energy, bro. Let me see some Indian step. Come on. Bap-bap-bap. Everything I do flows. Come on. Free up. Are you ready to battle? Are you ready for the B-boy solo final? WOMAN'S VOICE: Trey? Breathe, honey. Breathe. Ready? Ladies and gentlemen... Trey? This is it. ..B-boy, D-lux! I'll be right there with you. We all will. Whatever comes next, we face it together. We have... B-boy Trey! Make some noise!

Let's go! What an end to the final round! Let's go! You smashed it! Give it up for our two B-boys, D-Lux and Trey! Woo! Whoever wins this solo battle takes the crown for his team. The fate of these two B-boys now lies in the hands of the judges. Alright, let's see what the judges have to say. Fingers crossed. Judge one. And it goes to D-Lux! Right, so that is one to France. Judge two. B-boy Trey! Yes! Oh, so close. What's it gonna be? We have a split decision. It all rests on this last vote, last chance. Let's go, let's go. And the winner is... D-Lux! Well, that's that then. Er, the World Breaking Championship Invitational, the winners are... France. Trey Matthews should hold his head high because, honestly, that was one hell of a performance. D-Lux stays on top of the pile, but Trey, man. Trey. I thought he had that. So close. But, er, Team GB are the real winners here. I mean, think about it. Year after year after year, not making the quarter-finals, not even making the semi-finals. The underdogs did it. And those Matthews brothers! They are the rising stars of the breaking world. Watch out, D-Lux, cos they're coming for ya. I cannot wait to see what Team GB bring next year. We have been Carla and Pete. Thank you all for watching. Mwah! And the viewers tuning in at home, see you next year! Hey, this is everything, man. Couldn't have done it without you, bro. I love you, man. I love you too, bro.
