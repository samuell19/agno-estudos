I love this lovely melody, honey. You liar! You hate it. - Love it. - You always complain about it. I don't know what madman decided to use this music. But today I love it, and I love you, too. Sito! No! Careful with the lobster! We can't afford to waste it. Our fifth anniversary is the best occasion ever to cook this creature. "Clawy." Give Mommy a kiss. No! Get that off my face. - Enough. - Honey, seafood is an aphrodisiac. Right. I haven't tried it for so long... Are you talking about seafood? This will be a memorable night, honey. Nice wine, rice with lobster, passionate dancing and sex as if the world was coming to an end. But please dress up. Hey, come on! This is my favorite jersey. You know I bought it many years ago... Shit! - This again. - Again? Yes. It's happened to me before and I don't know if the elevator has been fixed. Yes! What? Did you think we'd be stuck in here forever? You wouldn't stand that music. When I look into your eyes I hear the most beautiful music ever. - You're being so goofy today. - A bit. And you know I can't help falling in love with silly men. Come on. PUSH THE BUTTON IN CASE OF EMERGENCY THE LIFT I hate it when you leave when we're arguing. - I have to take the trash out. - Exactly while we're talking? - Shit! What a shock. - I can't believe it. - And you tell me so nonchalantly! - Listen. - This time, it's not what it seems. - This isn't the first time. - It is what it seems. - I swear it's different! Tell me the truth. - I've told you everything. - No, there's something fishy. - There's always something "fishy." - Excuse me? - If you are going to act... - What? Crazy? - You mean I'm crazy? - No, I didn't say that. Sito, come on! What you did is very serious. Well, it's not like I said I was screwing your best friend! - ...while we're talking? - Shit! What a shock. I can't believe it. And you tell me so nonchalantly! - This is not... - What? What it seems? Of course it is what it seems. This isn't the first time. Sito, cut the bullshit and tell me the truth. I've told you many times, haven't I? Come on. What you said is very serious. I don't understand. What...? About screwing your best friend? It was a jo... - Shit! - I can't believe it. And you tell me so nonchalantly. - I mean... This is not... - It's not what it seems? I think it isn't. This isn't the first time. Of course it is what it seems! Sito, cut the bullshit and tell me the truth. I've told you several times, haven't I? Come on. What you said is very serious. I don't understand. About screwing your best friend? It was a jo... - Shit! - I can't believe it. And you tell me so nonchalantly. Tell me the truth. - If I told you the truth... - That's what I want. I want you to tell me the truth for once in your life. - You wouldn't believe it. - Well, try me. What if I told you you're repeating yourself? I mean... What? What's wrong with you? - I can't believe it. And you... - ...tell me so nonchalantly. - What? - I knew what you were going to say. I hate it when you interrupt me and finish my sentences - as if you knew... - This time I knew what you'd say. Because this is repeating over and over, like that movie... I don't know what you mean, but I'm getting angry. And now you'll ask me to tell you the truth. You don't say! Don't be silly. That's the whole point. But I knew it word by word. This is so you. Instead of telling me the truth, you make up an absurd story. And then you'll slap me. You got that right. I really want to... Ana! Please listen to me. - I need you to help me. - I can't help you anymore. What do you mean? We need to talk. - No, wait, calm... - I think we should call it quits. - I can't believe it... - Are you going to leave me? - What? - You just said so. Are you insane? I think I am. I am going crazy. This argument is in a loop and you're leaving me! And this fucking music! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Calm down! Sito, what is it? You're scaring me! What's going on? Sito! Sito, look at me! Sito! You are scaring me. Sito? Enough! Look at me! I need to get out of here. No matter what. I can't believe it. - And you tell me so... - Wait a second, honey! You've got some nerve. Turning your back on me while we argue? - Wait. - Sito, look at me. - Look at me, I'm talking to you. - Wait a fucking second! Can you stop acting like a psycho? Stop... Don't! I can't believe it. And you tell me... - What are you doing? - I need to stop the elevator - to tell you what's going on. - Can't you tell me on the way down? - Jesus! - It's working. Can you hear it? - What? - The silence. The... The peace. That fucking music stopped. - Sito, you're scaring me. - Wait, listen to me. How can I explain this? - Is this one of your tricks? - No! I swear it's not, honey. This argument is in a loop. Are you implying that our relationship is a constant argument? No, when we reach zero, we go back to ten. You leave me, you slap me... - I haven't touched you. - Not yet! Are you making all this up to avoid telling me how much you bet? That again? Of course. Okay. Time is not moving on for you. - Can you press zero, please? - No, listen to me. - No? - No. - Yes! - Listen... - I want to get out of here! - No, listen... - Then I'll do it! - No! Don't! Please! - What's wrong with you? - No! Shit! No... Please, don't do this to me. - Shit! - I can't believe it. And you tell me so nonchalantly! What are you doing? I'm telling you the truth this time, honey. You wonder why I stopped the elevator. - Yes, you read my mind. - Well... Forgive me. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. This is really something. You had never said "I'm sorry." You always say we need to talk. You're right, talking is good. Right. Can't we talk while going down? - I don't like being here! - No! I need us to focus for me to tell you, okay? Whatever. Listen, I know I should have told you beforehand, but it was a unique opportunity. Really. - Now or never. - How much did you spend? Well... sure I can tell you, but I don't think... It doesn't matter how much. Ask how much we can win. - How much? - We may win three times as much. How much money did you spend? You haven't worked all year, don't tell me you spent your last payment. - Invested. - Invested in online gambling. - Piss off. - It was a unique opportunity. I work all year and you're broke because you gambled online? It's clear that I chose the wrong strategy. Super clear! No, I mean... Well, forget it. You have no idea. Now we're moving. I haven't spent the money. - Really? - Do I want to spend it? I do. Do I think it is the best investment ever? I do. Will it solve our financial problems? Of course. But do you think I'd make a decision this big on my own? - Well, at home it sounded like... - I wasn't clear. Well, that's why I got angry. - The way you said it, I thought... - You never let me talk, honey. - Well, you weren't clear. - You never let me finish talking. You're the one who does that. - And now you attack me. - Honey, come on. Let's not make a big deal. - It was a misunderstanding. - Exactly! That's what it was. Later, calmly, we can talk about your business. We can both decide what to do. - Okay? - Okay. Perfect. So, why are we still here? What? Press the button to take the trash down. - Right. I mean... no. - No? - No, I can't. - Excuse me? Okay? You believe me. Right, honey? I can tell the truth. I'm a trustworthy boyfriend. Yes, you're the best boyfriend ever. - Push it. - I'm not kidding! Please. If you believe me, listen to me. Caught in the Elevator. The movie. It's on TV all the time. You know the movie? - Why do you ask that? - Answer me. Caught in the Elevator. - No, I haven't watched it. - No? Shit! It's about a killer and his victim who get caught in a space-time loop. - Doesn't ring a bell. - Okay. He... He's a hired hitman and she's a witness in a trial. When he's about to kill her, the scene repeats itself over and over. - What are you talking about? - Come on! It's an 80's classic! I haven't watched it. Are you leaving me for that? I should! Yes! Why are we stuck in here talking about a movie? Because that's what's happening to me. - Are you trying to murder me? - No. No, I mean I'm caught in a moment. - I think our argument was too... - How can I convince you? - There's no way. - I know! Okay, if you could tell me something I shouldn't know, I might surprise you in the loop. It worked in the movie. - Enough with the movie! - Tell me something, come on. - I don't know... - Anything. - I was raped when I was little. - Perfect! You never told me. Great. Of course I wasn't raped, you asshole! Shit! - I get it! - You do? - This is one of your tricks. - My tricks again. - Not "again." - Wait. We'll get home, discuss your business, - and you're hiding something. - Listen, honey, please. - You're so twisted! - Listen! - I don't want to! - Don't! - Please don't push it! - Move! - I'm going crazy! - I need to get out of here! Please don't! Don't fucking push it! What's wrong with you? Move. Sito, move. Move! I'm talking to you! Goddamn it, move! Wait. Let's stop arguing. I know where this is going. For better or for worse, we're connected, it's been five years. Okay? It won't be me who locks you up. No, the most important thing is that we're both happy. And, well... maybe it's for the better. Let's take a break and clear our heads. Is this because of the knee? What knee? Wait. Let's stop arguing. I know where this is going. For better or for worse, we're connected, it's been five years. Okay? It won't be me who locks you up. No, the most important thing is that we're both happy. And, well, maybe it's for the better. Let's take a break and clear our heads. Are you really going to leave me? - Wait. Let's stop arguing. - Don't you dare leave me. Hey... Wait. What are you doing? - We need to talk. - We are talking. No, listen to me. We're trapped. - In our relationship? - No. We're trapped in a space-time loop. I see. Like in Caught in the Elevator. - Great movie. - Yes! Just like that! I'm experiencing the same thing the hitman did. - Have you watched the movie? - No, but you told me. This was happening to you earlier. Do you believe me? I think the seafood didn't agree with you, honey. - Maybe you're allergic... - Got it! Tell me something I shouldn't know and I'll tell it to you, like in the movie. - Like what? - Something you've never told me. I've always told you everything, honey. Something I couldn't possibly know if you hadn't told me. I don't know, I... I don't know! I don't know what to tell you, I can't think of any... Yes! The Real Madrid lineup that won the seventh Champions League. If you can memorize it, I'll believe anything! Okay. Tell me. - Really? - Yes. Okay. Well, here it goes. Illgner, Panucci, Hierro, Sanchis, Roberto Carlos... No, wait. Are you really memorizing the Real Madrid lineup that - won the 7th Champions League? - Yes. I'm desperate! I'd do anything for you to believe me. Do you? I do, honey, but... You talk about a movie you haven't watched and now you memorize... - Why something so absurd? - You weren't able to convince me. - Well, I can say I don't believe... - No! - It's fine! - You're too rational. You'd never make this up. So, what do we do now? - I just had an idea. - Really? What are you doing? I don't care if you spent the money, okay? I want to be with you and I love you. - This is one of your tricks. - It is not. I just need you to be honest with me. Well, you know I've never lied to you. - Let's pretend you didn't say that. - Okay, fine. - Okay. Let me ask you a question. - Fine. Shoot. Do you want to live here at your parents' forever? Well, it's a great home. The neighborhood is great. The building is a little old, but... But you picture yourself living here in ten years. Well... I don't know. No, I don't think so. No. And what do you think that we need in order to have get own apartment? It's really funny when you talk like Speedy González. - We call them "flats." - I know. - Answer me. - Right. I'm sorry. Well, I guess we need a fixed monthly wage. Right? And a little bit extra to pay the deposit? Right. So you'd need a steady job. Not necessarily... I have a great relationship with the heads of Design, and they might get you a job at one of the company's stores. As a salesman? But you'd be a manager in a year. You're so smart! No! I said no! You know what I think about multinationals and the Third World! - Come on! I'm serious. - Fine. Fine, you're right. Okay? I need to find a way to make money, but that's why - I invested in this business. - You invested? It's a tested system. The risk is minimal, really. Let's leave the trash downstairs and I'll explain back home. Wait, honey. How much have you invested? Well, that's not important when you think about the revenue. In less than a month I'll be able to pay for three months' rent. Even the deposit! I just have to keep on investing and winning. I guess you invested a lot of money, if we're going to win so much. Trust me, honey. We'll make a living out of this for as long as we want to. We could even, listen to me, get enough money to start our own business. Well... Let's go home, okay? Okay. Yes. You know? I was worried you'd get angry when I told you, but you didn't. I'm very proud of your growth, honey. We're gonna conquer the world! This is great. Honey, I've been thinking. Thinking? You were furious a second ago. - Hey, what are you doing? - I had a revelation. - You always say I'm too rational. - Yes, you are. And I think this time you're right. I think I was wrong. - Really? - Yes. - This a wonderful opportunity. - Wonderful? And we need to hurry. If people hear about this business, - it won't be as profitable. - I couldn't agree more, honey! - And you know what? - What? We should invest all of our savings. These are the best news ever! Honey, for better or for worse, it's been five years, we're connected. That's exactly what I've done. - 6000 euros? - Yes. That I saved for our apartment? It's really funny when you talk like Speedy González. We say "flat" not "apartment", honey. Hey, what is it? - Hey. - I mean... It's so exciting, isn't it? I can't believe how... deeply connected we are. - Unbelievable! - Unbelievable. Come here. Are you okay now? Wait. Let's stop arguing. - I know where this is going. - Wait. I'll show you something. - A surprise, or what? - Look. Take a look in there. I don't understand this game. I don't see anything. Why such cruelty? It looks like Barcelona's jersey. You did this because of our argument, right? I did it because I hate this jersey. You've gone too far. You've gone a dozen miles too far! - Wait. Let's stop arguing. - No, wait, my Prince Charming. I want to share something with you. What? I've been thinking about your parents, the Marquis and Marchioness. What are you saying? Don't be so dramatic, woman. They are humble people. They do own a couple of plots, but... I can't stand them. They are bigots. Well, you need to understand them. They're old... Understand them? They still think I'm from Argentina. I don't think they even know where Mexico is. I really want to build an altar for them. An altar? On a graveyard. For the Day of the Dead. You've gone too far. You've gone a thousand miles too far. - Wait. Let's stop arguing. - Wait, my soulmate. I want to tell you something. Tell me, my soulmate. Remember my first trip to Mexico? I wish I could forget it. We had just started dating and you left for three months. I screwed Eduardo. Screwed... as in screwed? Yes, baby, am I not funny when I talk like Speedy González? Eduardo, your ex? The hunky millionaire? You told me you'd never seen him again! Well, we all have our dirty little secrets, don't we? - You've gone too far! - How far? How many miles? What...? And to cap it all, you mock me. You've gone a zillion miles too far! Wait, let's stop arguing. I know where this is going. What are you doing? Are you okay? I am now. Better than ever. - Why did you stop the elevator? - Because we need to talk. I'll be damned! Is this a magic elevator? Like in that movie...? Yes, but this is not a movie, Sito. We need to find a way to get out. Right, okay. Let's do this. Okay, so you say when we get to zero, it starts all over again, right? What if we go up? Let's try that. It won't let me. No, it's an old elevator, once you're going down, you can't go up. Shit. That's right. - Do you have a signal? - No. Nothing. - What are you looking for? - A solution. Here, help me. Pull there. Shit. There's no door. Where the fuck are we? There must be another way. Wait. In Caught in the Elevator the loop couldn't be stopped. This is more like a time machine, isn't it? A time machine that only goes back a few seconds? What did you expect? It's a Spanish invention. We need to find a way to get out of here. No, if this is a time machine, - the answer must be in here. - Look. What if we go up? No, in the movie they escape without getting out. - No, come on, pull that handle. - Try that. The answer may be there. - Pull it! - No! - Pull it! - Shit. "Pull it." - No, it's blocked. - Pull it hard! It's not moving! Look, we screwed this! Great. There must be a way to open that door. There isn't! Why is there a socket? To charge your telephone. It's an 80's elevator. Right, for the electric shaver, then. You're hilarious. PUSH THE BUTTON IN CASE OF EMERGENCY Honey, please, we don't know how this machine works. No, but there must be a way. Well, if we've traveled in this thing someone will surely find us, right? Right, yes. Right? There's something in here. Give me the knife. What did you say? There's something behind this sticker. - But, are you listening...? - I need the knife. Here, take the knife. All I'm saying is, they'll find us eventually. But it could take hours, that's true. And, you know? In the movie, they end up falling in love and making love. And, well, since you and I have never done it in an elevator... Okay, Sito, stop! We haven't done it for a while. - Do you believe what I told you? - Yes, of course. If you believe that we are trapped in a space-time loop, you'll see this isn't the time to screw. Right, but... Screw as in... screw? - It's really funny when... - ...I talk like Speedy González. - You didn't find it funny earlier. - Earlier? We are trapped. This isn't the time to "screw" or to "bang." No, the time was after dinner, but you ruined it. - I'm sorry? - Fine. We both ruined it. Really? Fine, I ruined it. It was my fault. You didn't understand anything! I did understand. Please, we're trapped in an elevator. It's not only that we're trapped in an elevator. - Hey, wait... - Let's get real, Sito. Right, but we don't have to do this here, we'll do it at home... Even if we're stuck in here for a lifetime, this will never work. We need to leave it. Really? Yes. Leave it, or I'll leave you. - You'll cool down and... - I'll leave you forever. What do you mean, forever? More has happened than you think. What has happened? Things have happened. What things? I can't believe it. Did you use the loops to manipulate me? - I used them to get the truth. - I'd never do that to you! - Are you sure? - What are you implying? Do you really think I'm stupid? Very well. If that's the game you want to play, let's play. - Fuck! - Shit! - Fuck! - Shit! We need to get out of here. Are you really going to leave me? - And we have to do this together. - It's what I said, right? Or is it just the gambling? Look! What if I told you I haven't invested yet? Look! There's a plaque. Ana, answer me, please. Shut up and listen! "Failure: emergency button plus one." This makes no sense, Ana. "Fire. - Emergency button plus two." - Will you go back to Mexico? Is...? "Power cut: emergency..." No, I don't need that. Please, Ana, listen to me! Can we please talk like adults? Understand! It's over. I can't stand you. I can't stand a minute more in here with you! "Unlock trapdoor. Emergency button plus four." - Should we go up? - No, I'll go! You stay here! - What? - It's over! Let's part ways! Don't be silly, Sito. We need to get out. I'm getting out! Look! Sito, don't be an asshole! We need to do this together. Well, that's a problem! We're no longer together! Well, maybe... we could still be friends. No! Stop right there! Trash bag. - What do you want it for? - Give it to me! - What do you want it for? - I don't need to explain! Then come down and get it. Well, did you see anything? Sito. What are you doing? I'm hungry. What? Did you throw away my mezcal? Yes. Now I'm going to drink your mezcal! And you stay right there! Don't move! Sito? Tell me something! And you leave me here all by myself! OTHER ISSUES: GO UP TO COMMAND ROOM Sito! The plaque says we should go up to the Command Room! Sito? The button... The button. Press the button, please! Okay. Arm! Please, push it with both arms simultaneously. Hurry up! Push it! We need to do this together. Before I fell, I went up, and nothing. But we have to try again. The answer is up there. Look. "Go up to Command Room." I didn't see a Command Room up there. But we need to investigate. If we find it, what do we do? "Rafa and Jennifer." "Jordy is a jerk." "Manu, wherever you are, your Mery will never forget you." 24th, 1999. Manu and María. Right, they used to live on the fifth floor. - The keepers. - Do you know them? I don't remember well, I was too young, but I think he left her many years ago and she lost her mind, or something. Careful. No wonder you fell, you can't see shit in here. These emergency lights, you see. Shit. Where the fuck are we? Let's see. - Which one did you climb? - This one. But it didn't go well. I think I cut my arm with that. Should we try this one? Okay. Shit. Fuck! My hands were killing me. Hey, Ana, may I ask you something? - Tell me. - Promise me you'll tell the truth. - But you're the liar here. - Fine, no more lies. Fine? I'm done with lying. Okay? Shoot. Ask me. Did you, in the loops that I rebooted, tell me something important that I can't remember? Gosh! I'm so tired. This... Ana, please. Ana. Well... yes. I guess. Did you? Well, I guess I did, but I can't remember right now. Fine. I swear I meant well. But I screwed up, as usual. I spent all your savings gambling. I know that was very wrong, honey, but we could have won twice... - I don't care if you win or lose. - There's a difference! No, the thing is that you took my money, our money, without telling me. - But listen... - No excuses! I need to know this won't happen again. that you're willing to change. I will change. I promise. - But... - No. No more "buts." No more lies. That's it. Okay. Well... Do you remember your Real Madrid jersey? - My favorite jersey. I do. - Right. I accidentally put it in the trash. Accidentally, right? I can't stand it. It's in the trash bag in the elevator. Well, I was very fond of it, but it's just a jersey. - Well... - Wait. No. I know you very well. Is that the most serious thing that you told me? Well, I also remembered your parents. How much they love cultural diversity. I see. Well, I'm not that dumb. It's obvious that you don't get along with my parents. And... that's it. Nothing more. No, wait! Ana! You know what? I don't believe you. We're getting closer, but that's not it. Do you really want to know? We said no more lies. Fine. If that's what you want. This will be very important for our relationship. Come on. Do you remember my first trip to Mexico? I do. We had just started dating and you left for three months. - I think it's not important... - No. Please go on, honey. - Is it really necessary? - It is. What happened on that trip? I promise I won't get mad. Fine. I ran into Eduardo... Eduardo... - your hunky millionaire ex? - Right. You told me you'd never seen him again. But okay. Well, that's fine. It's not that serious, if you just met - for drinks, or something... - We didn't just meet for drinks. - What did you do, Ana? - Sito, you're hurting me. - Tell me, what did you do? - Let go of me, you're hurting me. Please tell me what you did! I screwed him. Did you screw him as in... screw? Sito! Are you okay? How could you be such a whore? It just happened once. We had some mezcal and... Just once! No problem, then. It's a good thing it wasn't 25! Sito, calm down. Let's go down and we'll talk on the cabin. You want to go down! No fucking way! Don't ever speak to me again in your fucking life. You bastard! Bastard instead of a whore, which you are! - You whore! - Stop it, Sito. You know what? I wasn't going to tell you. This is full of something that you love. - What? - Look, it's crawling up your leg. Look! Ana! Sito! MERY, I NEED YOU MANU What the fuck is this? The command room! I told you! I'll be damned. "Mery, I need you. Manu." My neighbor did all of this. The keeper? Who would have thought he was crazy? That's how we'll end up to if we don't find a way to get out. I can't turn it on. Is it true about Eduardo? Sito, I just fell because of you and you ask me this? But, is it true or isn't it? - Ana, answer me, goddamnit! - Look! No! Stop that music! Stop it! Travel journal. - This is Dr. Manuel Fernández. - The keeper? I'm here to finish the most important experiment in the history of humanity. The company said I was crazy. They kicked me from my own project. - Ana, I just want to know... - Let me listen! But I'm not giving up so many years of research. I finally succeeded. By using the power of lightning, I'll be the first person to time travel. Journey 37. I'm the first person to time travel, but in a broken machine. Just like in that movie, the machine creates a loop every time I try to travel. I miscalculated. Never mind. I'll fix it. Journey 101. I recalculated to understand what happened and be able to go back. No doubt, I am in another dimension. An unknown dimension similar to my reality, a copy of the original elevator ride. Twenty-one seconds, ten floors, this command room, but the void seems endless, and the elevator goes up and down in a loop. I know how to get out of here. I can't power it with lightning, but thanks to the manual system that I devised, I'll make it. Did you hear that? There's a manual system. We need to find that manual system. If only I could turn this on... - Why? - What do you mean? - We need to get out of here. - I mean, why did you do it? Sito, come on, it was ages ago. It meant nothing. I don't care how long ago it was! You slept with your ex and you expect me to be cool! We just need to get out of here. Is he more handsome? Taller? Does he speak seven languages? He's a successful businessman and he has his own fucking NGO? - Is that why you banged him? - Sito, it was a mistake. And it made me realize I wanted to be with you. I don't believe you! I can't trust you anymore! Excuse me? Who stole 6000 euros? - It was an investment, Ana! - I don't care! I do care what...! How did you do that? I slapped it. It always works. - Should I hit "yes"? - Whatever. Please! Drop it! I will get out of here with or without your help. Manual system. It says that I need to get an infinite battery. Come on, try to find it. "Version A." "Version C." What the hell is an infinite battery? INFINITE BATTERY The infinite battery! Great, so now what? Should I move this? That's too easy! Come on! It's a Spanish invention, what did you expect? Come on, let's go! Sito... What? No, nothing. Now you have to tell me. What? How does the movie end? You don't want to know. But, do they manage to get out? They do. But they go back to the starting point. And? At the starting point, he's an assassin appointed to kill her, and since there is no loop, he kills her. But, well, that's just a movie. Fuck! Something's not working. We'll have to go up again. Watch out, I'll open the trapdoor. - Ready. - Do it. There you go. - What are you doing? - I'm not going. Sito, we need to keep on trying to get out! Go, charge the battery and once the green light's on, I'll let you know. Fine. - I'll go up. - Okay. - If it's not on, come and get me. - Yeah, sure. Did she really put it in the trash? Goodbye, honey. Ana! Jesus! Hey! Ana! Come on, you're okay. Honey, come on. He's dead, come on, let's go. Come on! Up! - Get that off me! - Okay. What is that? Well, he doesn't look too good, but I think that's Manuel. - Oh, God! - Calm down, relax! - It's over. - Relax? You left me alone, Sito! What are you doing? Eight, nine and ten. Like the floors. This may be the manual system. "Y." "Y"? Wait a minute. Look! Here is a "Y" and a socket! Be careful! It fits! Now we just need to plug all the cables. Here's the other end! Ready! Here! - Done? - Done. Let's plug the "X." We just need to plug it. Couldn't he do this on his own? Otherwise you wouldn't have found him skinny like that. Damn it! It should work, we plugged all the cables. Well, come on. We should keep on investigating. You were right. We'll end up just like Manuel. Look! Shit! We need to hear that. - The answer may be there. - Let's use a pen. I used to hear Bunbury on tape when I was in high school. There we go. María. Mery. My love. If you ever listen to this tape, it will mean that the experiment succeeded. But it's the same to me. I failed because we're not together, and I can't take it anymore. When we moved here, you thought we would only be the building's keepers. Something temporary. I never told you the truth. I was so close... I had to finish my experiment. and I thought I should to hide it. Everything seemed to be perfect. A building with everything I'd need to complete the journey. A building very similar to the company's at my disposal 24/7. I continued experimenting, but I got so obsessed that I was unable to tell you. You used to say couples should tell each other everything. As usual, you were right. If I had told you, you would've convinced me to forget it and I wouldn't be here now. I would be home, with you. I really miss you. If you ever listen to this tape, I want you to know it. I'm sorry I lied to you. You are what I need the most in the world. Shit. He really missed her. What if he literally needed her in order to get out? What do you mean? This couldn't be done by one person alone. On three. One, two, three. On three! - Ready! - One! Two! Three! No more lies. No more gambling. I'll take the job and we'll have a new home. - And once we have savings... - What? Well, some of your ideas are not too bad. They're fucking great. We'll analyze the market, and once we have the money... Say it. We'll start our own business. I love you. We've never done it in an elevator, especially not a moving one. - We haven't done it in a month. - In years! Come on, take this shit off. Okay, fine. Hurry up! We only have three minutes! Three minutes? Two to spare. You silly man! But you know I can't help falling in love with silly men. - And you tell me so nonchalantly! - Listen. - This time, it's not what it seems. - This isn't the first time. - It is what it seems. - I swear it's different! Tell me the truth. - I've told you everything. - No, there's something fishy. - There's always something "fishy." - Excuse me? - If you are going to act... - What? Crazy? - You mean I'm crazy? - No, I didn't say that. Sito, come on! What you did is very serious. Well, it's not like I said I was screwing your best friend! I was kidding about your best friend. - Yeah, but... - What's wrong with you? - Right, I overdid it a little. - You did. But I'm still very angry for what you did. - On top of this? - "On top of this"? No... I can't stand it when you get like this, Sito. So... banging is off the table, right? - Sito, I'm about to leave you. - Okay, no banging. Watch a TV show? - When will we finish talking? - Not a show. A movie? You choose. A romantic comedy. Hey, have you watched Caught in the Elevator? Is that a romantic comedy? 80's classic. Great movie, honey. But I said I wanted to watch a romantic comedy. It is a romantic comedy, and you will love it, really. I don't know why, but I really feel like watching it. And when are we going to finish talking? - Haven't we finished? - No. Yes, we've talked it through, honey... - We've talked it through. - No, we haven't. - We're done talking about it. - No way.
