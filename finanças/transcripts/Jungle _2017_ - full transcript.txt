Dad, look. The Captain told me that you know this river upside down. My friend is lost. He is lost? In the jungle? Forget it. He is dead. Your friend is already gone. My friend is alive and i need your help. I cant help you. I never begged to no one. But i'm begging you. Please. How much for the boat? - Whats wrong? - We have to go back. Its impossible. You did everything that was in your power. Thank you. I'm glad that God helped you to comeback to us.
