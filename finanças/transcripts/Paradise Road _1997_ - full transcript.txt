* Mad about the boy * * I know it's stupid * * To be mad about the boy * * I'm so ashamed of it * * But must admit the sleepless nights * * I've had about the boy * * Walking down the street * Excuse me. Excuse me. So where are you from? Mudgee. A country girl. I knew it. How? They're always shy. You blushed when I asked you to dance. I did not. It's just hot. Have you a boyfriend? Yes. Oh, no, no, I had one, but he's in Egypt or somewhere. Egypt? Well, forget him. He's probably chasing some dusky maiden... 'round the pyramids by now. Know what they call this dance? No idea. The Crush. Do they? Well, I'm not really complaining. You're so beautiful, Rosemary. So are you. You can't say that, can you? Men aren't-- I am not beautiful. Yes, you are. * I'm feeling quite insane and young again * * And all because I'm mad about the boy * We've got everyone Churchill can spare. Thousands of bloody Australians... drinking the place dry. And all to fight tiny little... Japanese chaps wearing spectacles. They're all cross-eyed, you know. Can't aim their damn guns. At night, they can't see at all. Do they all have white sticks and guide dogs? Phyllis, it's true. Really. Cyril, remember that Japanese gardener we had? He had glasses as thick as-- The bottom of a gin bottle? Yes. Man: It's certainly a fact their weapons are useless. My Godfather! All they can make are tin toys... and cameras that don't work. If you don't mind me saying so-- even if you do-- I don't think I've ever heard... such a total load of poppycock. They've conquered most of Asia. And those "little Japanese chaps--" You heard of a place called Pearl Harbor? My dear, Topsy, Adrienne, Pearl Harbor was a surprise. A sneak attack. We're all ready and waiting for them. I hope you're right. [ Indistinct, Talking Under Music ] Thanks. Ooh, that one come on a bit strong, eh? Sort of. He's nice. I just don't reckon he's got too much upstairs. Come on, Oggi. It's what they got downstairs... that really counts. * A little magic that would finally * 3...4... * This dream that pains me and enchains me * * But I can't because I'm mad about the boy * How's that son of yours, Pargiter? Where is he? Westminster? Robbie, what was that? Just target practice, I expect, my dear. Target practice, at night? Mmm? Celia, run upstairs and get my wrap, will you, dear? You're wearing it, Mummy. Oh, so I am! I was just confused. * And enchains me, but I can't * * Because I'm mad about the boy * * Mad about the boy * Pardon me, please. * I'm mad about the boy * Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm sorry to disturb this evening's entertainment, but I have some rather unhappy news. The Japanese have now crossed the Jahore Strait... and have broken through our lines. And their guns have the city in range. As you can hear. But, Colonel, only today, the Straits Times reported... that the Japanese were being driven back. I'm afraid, sir, the only true thing you read in the newspapers is the cricket scores. Now, don't worry. This hotel will be perfectly safe. Why? As I'm sure the Japanese high command... will want to stay here... and avail themselves of the facilities. The city will fall within a few days. All European women and children... are to leave immediately. He can't mean us. They're going to need us. All soldiers to return to their units. Good luck. Well, now we know. They can see, which we were told they couldn't. And they can fight, which we were told they couldn't. And they're here, which we were told they would never be. Stop it, sir! It's just up there. Are you all right? Come on, girlies. Just leap down. That's it. Nurse: Thanks. Take cover! Now, this isn't quite... what I had planned for us. Oh, really? I should have sent you home months ago. Well, at least Charlie will be surprised. I wouldn't have seen him until your next leave. Woman: Good evening. Nice night for the collapse of an empire. Come on, now. Before you know it, we'll be back in Portsmouth.... sailing. You are a great outdoor girl, Rosemary. That's one thing I love about you. And indoors? I thought you liked me indoors. Indoors? Mmm. Oh, yes. What rubbish! Are you aware that my husband... is the head of Singapore-- He could be the King of Bongo Bongo, but you can still only take... one suitcase on board. That's it. Oh, Celia, come along quickly. Seaman: Gangway stowed! Mrs. Roberts: Take care, Robbie. Bye, Daddy. Ropes away! Take it to the end of the wharf, Chee Wan, and push it off. Yes, sir. Damned if I'll have some bloody Japanese officer driving it about. Lifejackets on. Do them up, nice and tight. Just ask us if you don't know how. I'm glad to help you, ladies. Woman: Thank you. Lifejackets on, please. Just let me know if you need any help, miss. So, what's going to happen to the men, do you think? Woman: With us out of the way, they're probably already tucked up... with their Malayan girlfriends. It seems so ridiculous, shoving us out at the last minute. It seems now they should have... shoved us out months ago. Oh, in all fairness, Phyllis, we could have gone. I think we chose to stay. Tea? Thanks. You're all Australians. That's right. We've been in Singapore for 2 months. Now that they must really need nurses, you're leaving. Phyllis! Oh, no, it's true. It's ridiculous. I was a secretary at Army H.Q. I saw the reports on what the Japs did to the nurses... in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Seaman: Lifejackets on, please. Do them up, nice and tight. Oh, oh, don't go! Lovely. He can wait. He'll still be there. Seaman: Lifejackets on, please. Give them back! I haven't taken them. Oh! It's really quite simple, Mummy. Look! Like this. Boy: Just give them back! Here, let me do it. Oh, thank you. Oh, Mrs.-- Merritt. Topsy Merritt. Of course, the American. Your husband runs the pineapple canning factory. That's right. Give them back! I don't got them! Perhaps the boys could be restrained a little. I know... the conditions are somewhat unusual, but this is my cabin. Your cabin? It's my cabin. I understood that Marty arranged this cabin for me. My husband is an engineer... with coastal traders. Mine is the head of the P.W.D. Mine's in pineapples. Look, girls, we're just going to have to get along. It's only 5 weeks. Oh, God! Oh, very good. Seaman: Keep your lifejacket on, please. Oh, thank you. Excuse me, ladies. Uh, how much longer... do we have to wear these lifejackets? A few minutes now, lass. Once we're 11 hours out of Singapore, we're out of range of Jap fighters. But the goddess Hera, the wicked stepmother, was so jealous of Hercules... that one night she crept into his room... and put 2 deadly snakes in his cradle. But he was-- What's that? Hard to starboard! Aah! Seaman: Abandon ship! Turn sideways, Mummy. Sideways! Don't reckon she's got a sideways. Are we sinking? Yes, that's right, dear. We're going to jump into the water, and it's going to be lovely. Oh! Take cover! Get down! Tommy! Tommy! Come on, children. No, thank you, dear. I'll stay here. The ship is sinking, Mrs. Roberts. Hello, Mrs. Roberts. Remember me? Rosemary Leighton-Jones. We met at the cricket club? Oh, oh, of course, dear. How are you? Some other time, maybe. Yes. Just take my hand, Mrs. Roberts. We'll jump together. Of course. Woman: Get in the raft! Get a place in the boat! Could be worse, I suppose. Do you think so? Well, the water could be cold. That's true. Must be Sumatra. Yes. It's amazing how everyone's just disappeared. It's like one of those girls' adventure annuals... my mother gave me every Christmas. It's an adventure I could certainly do without. They always had happy endings. Oh! Now I'm cold. If you spend a penny, it'll warm you up. Huh? We used to swim in the North Sea... in our school hols. It was freezing. We always did it. Oh! It's working. I'm starving. Yeah, me, too. Rosemary Leighton-Jones. My husband is Dennis Leighton-Jones. Royal Malayan Volunteers. How do you do? Susan Macarthy. Australian Army Nursing Corps. Adrienne Pargiter, wife of tea planter. How do you do? Hello.Yeah. You are English ladies. Yes.Yes. Australian. Ah, yes. I was for some years in Singapore. I was a, uh, newspaper correspondent. May I ask what you ladies are doing here in Sumatra? Our ship was sunk. By your planes. We swam to shore. What can I say? Except that attacking the enemy... is a characteristic of war. The Prince Albert was full of women and children, not soldiers. A matter of regret. More than that, there's a Geneva convention... laying down the rules of war. Japan has signed no Geneva convention. If a war has begun, it can only mean... the time for rules has ended. The aim is to win. Good luck. Up until you reminded him of the Geneva convention, I thought we were going to be invited to dine. Oggi! Susan! Susan! How-- How did you get here? Jap navy boat picked us up. What were they like? Oh, gentlemen compared with this lot. English Empire Number 10. Nippon Ichiban, Number 1. Hai! I am Colonel Hirota. And uh, I am in command of this--of this place. Days of British and Dutch peoples... exploitation of Oriental people all finish. Now they exploit Oriental people. You Europeans had great "proudry" and arrogance. Think Oriental people inferior. Situation now 100% reversed. Colonel, I'd like to know... how long you expect us to remain... in these perfectly-- Aah! Woman: Take it all to the kitchen, please. Please, bring everything to the kitchen. Not so bad, really. Woman: Uhh! Disgusting. At least it's food. I went to an English boarding school. I meant by those standards. It's funny. In the kitchen, there seemed so much. What do you mean? Well... How do we know they're dividing it up fairly... those Dutch? Oh, come off it. They don't speak English. Well, I think the food that you saw... had to be divided up among over 400 people. That's correct. It doesn't go far. I don't know that the Dutch are noted for their cooking. No, not like the English people. All I can say is, I hope this is over... very, very soon. When our boys get here, it'll be just a few weeks. Your boys? What about our boys? Frankly, I don't care which boys do it, just as long as we're going home. She's right. Any boys will do me. Thought they might. I've heard they're sending all the noncombatants home. What do you think about that, now? Where did you hear that? Oh, just around and about. We're all noncombatants, Mrs. O'Riordan. No. I mean like me. See, I'm Irish. We're neutral. There's 2 Portuguese ladies. And you... well, you're... I have a German passport. Well, then...you're on their side, aren't you? So you think. Already I have escaped 2 madmen in Europe. Now I'm catched by the oriental version. You're from Singapore. I don't think we've met. I don't think. The English don't invite Jewish refugees... to the cricket club. My husband and me, we are doctors in Asian hospital. Oh, you're a doctor. That is what I say. You like perhaps... I send to Leipzig for the certificate? Oh, no. I-- Anyway... they're sure to let you go. No. Japanese men don't like lady. Call Japanese lady zashiki bita. Means "old pig in back of house." Sounds strangely familiar. I--I was in China when the Japanese invaded, and I think the people they despised most... were Europeans, then prisoners, then women. Well... that's us. All three. Quick. You see man before? Well, no. Only here. So, you know, some little Oriental men... big like this. And some big European men... like this. You never can tell. Really. Mm-hmm. Bugger! And I thought being a secretary... was a rotten job. What if they do win the bloody war? They'll have us doing this forever. They're not going to win. We'll win. The British don't lose wars. Yeah? I reckon if I'd paid attention in school, I could think of a few. They tell me you are a model. Oh, yes, it's true. I think that you're very beautiful. Yeah. You have been to Paris? Many times. Ohhh... wonderful clothes and... the lovely people. The elegance. In Singapore, did you model? Oh, no. I was visiting my husband there. Oh. I'm modeling next season for Hartnell's in London. London! Ohhh... Well, I hope I am. Ja. You know, you could do some work, Mrs. Tippler. In this heat? We're all supposed to work if we're not sick. You're just lazy. Lazy You. Ohhh... I'm completely... buggered. Phyllis! Well, I'm sorry. There's simply no other word for it. I'm buggered. You know, this place sure ain't Alcatraz. We could be under that fence... and into that jungle... before you could say "boo." Well, don't forget to write, Topsy. You would die in that jungle. It's full of snakes. Boa constrictors. Horrible. Yeah, well, after 3 months in this place... it doesn't sound so bad. The locals will betray you. The Japanese have got them all terrified. That's right. Some of the men escaped, and they brought them back. They cut off their noses and their ears, and they hung them upside down, so they did. How awful. All the loose change... must've fallen out of their pockets. They'd have hated that. But it's true! Yeah, well, you've convinced me. This place ain't so lousy. Room service is a bit slow. Mmm. What men, Mrs. O'Riordan? That guard. You know, the one that looks like the actor. Mr. Moto. He's in all those... Japanese detective films. Peter Lorre. Mr. Moto. Yes, Mrs. O'Riordan, but what men? I was telling you. That guard was saying... there's a camp full of men over the hill... just a few miles away. Now, they're Dutchmen, I think. But he says there are some from Singapore. Oh, Hudson insisted on growing... masses and masses of red carnations. Woman: Ooh, lovely. Hey, Dr. Mizushima. Get me some quinine, eh? And some bandages... and morphine und a stethoscope. Even some aspirin is good. Just Mercurochrome. Mercurochrome. I know. I-- You Japanese think it cures everything. Then you give me some cigarettes, eh? I'm a German, your ally. I'm not one of these British colonialists. Uhh. Only Japanese? Taste like cow dung. How she is? Oh, Doctor... can't get her to eat anything. I think it's just... uhh... too much for her, really. For a lot of them. They don't adjust, they die, my dear. How many gone since we come to this wonderful place? Oh, 4. Not so bad. Be worse by Christmas... with the bad food and no medicine. Christmas?! The war will be over by Christmas. Don't you bet your fuddler on that one, my darling. What's a fuddler? I think I can guess. Oh, fuddler. Do you think she's really a doctor? What do you mean? Well, who'd know? She certainly got herself... out of working in the field-- Shh! ...and cleaning out the lavatory. Buck up, Phyllis. It's Christmas. Where's the champagne? The plum pudding Oh, it's lovely, Adrienne. Perhaps now might be a time to deal with that dog. He'd make a nice stew. It's only a little dog. It don't eat much. Yes, but he does eat what we could give to the children. But how will Mrs. Roberts cope without him? She's right, Edna. It'd be the end of her. I think... this must be the servants' quarters. Tell Chen Li... only to come when we call. Mommy, that's not Chen Li. That's Wing. Aiya... Malaria bad. So sorry. Yes. We can't get any quinine? I think she's been stealing... the sugar again, dear. You have to watch these Chinese, Robbie. I get quinine. [ Shouting In Japanese ] [ Shouting In Japanese ] [ Shouting In Japanese ] Not so young no more. Quinine? Oh. Thank you. Did they see you? I think maybe no. Ohhh... They catch them? Can't tell. Here you are, Mommy. Take this. That black market could get us all into trouble. They warned us. They'll cut our rations gain. She's right. Here, Mommy. This can help. Wait! Wait! [ Man Shouts In Japanese ] What is it? There's no more gin. It's sake. Japan drink. Very strong. You no like? Mmm. I wouldn't say that. Look who's here. Kempei-Tai. What's that? Sounds like a Chinese dish. Would be better. It's Japan's secret police. Ho! Oh! Oh! Ohhh! Oh! Oh! Uhh! Ohh! Ho! Uhhh! Wing. Ohh! Ohh! Aaah! Aaah! "How silent is this place. "The brilliant sunshine filters through the trees. "The leaves are rustled by a gentle breeze. "A wild and open space, "by shrubs, pink-tipped, "mauve-blossomed, is o'ergrown. "A hush enfolds me, "deep as I have known, "unbroken, safe, by distant insects drone. "A jungle clearing. "A track... through which we bear our load to Him." It is our Paradise Road. How silent is this place. How sacred is this place. [ Women Speaking Dutch ] One would think they would've learned... a few words of English by now. They understand a lot more than they let on. Oh. Wait a minute. I want my soap. Where's that soap? Soap? Soap? Soap. Soap. Ah. Ah. What else? Nay. Nay. Don't give me that. I was here. Right there! I had to write an I.O.U.... for £5 for that soap, and I want it now! Ladies! Ladies! Please! Calm down! What is this? So you think they took your soap? I don't think so. You don't think so? Well, I bloody well think so. Maybe we should just have a look... in their ugly bloody dresses or their silly wooden shoes. Ladies. See soap. Ohhh... Elgar. What? You were humming the Elgar Concerto. [ Hums Notes From Concerto ] Do you know I went to the very first performance. Felix Salmond. Leeds, 1920. That was almost my last concert. The church sent me to China a few months later. But... I mean, you're not a musician, are you, Miss Drummond? Your poem. I assumed you taught English. Oh, I taught a bit of everything in China. But... I did study music at Durham. Miss Drummond... would you care to take a turn with me... in the gardens before lights out? I'd be delighted, Mrs. Pargiter. Oh. I'm so sorry. I've interrupted your prayers. Oh, perhaps, it's just as well. I was about to ask God... to smite Captain Tanaka and the Snake... with a severe case of dysentery. I studied music at the Royal Academy... under Sir Henry Wood. What did you play, the violin or the viola? The violin. How did you know? Just a guess. You were humming... the Symphonie Concertante the other night, and that has leads for both instruments. Yes. I came out to Singapore with my father, and I met my husband William, who's an absolute darling, but music was fairly low on the list of priorities... for Singapore society. Very low, judging by the stories I've read... by Mr. Somerset Maugham. Oh, well... if you've read him, you think we do nothing but drink G & Ts... and murder one another and indulge in ceaseless-- Wife swapping? What will they think of next? Do you know, Miss Drummond, I feel I owe you an apology. Me My-- My snobbery. We never mixed with missionaries in Singapore. We were taught to look down on them. Oh, what a tedious lot, most of us, and very self-righteous. You're not serious. Not really. Well... maybe just a bit. Oh, dear. Back we go, or the head prefect will be after us. Do you know, Mrs. Pargiter, I've just had a wonderful idea. An orchestra? You're crazy. Do you expect the Japanese would give us instruments? Not at all, Harriet. I thought I'd made that clear. We don't need instruments. I don't think so, Adrienne. After what happened, no one's in the mood for a sing-along. But that's just the point. I don't think it's such a bad idea. Do you read music, Mrs. O'Riordan? Read it? Didn't know you could read it. But I can sing it all right. I was in the choir at school. I think it's a harebrained idea, Adrienne. We hardly have the strength to talk. You want my advice, you'll forget the whole thing. You think the Japs will agree? Not on your Nellie. They have forbidden any meetings... or religious services. We can't even have classes for the children. You must have perfect recall, Miss Drummond. I envy you. They say Mozart could play any piece... after hearing it only once. But I'm cheating. I know Dvorák back to front. It's probably full of mistakes. I don't think so. It's rather complicated, isn't it? You'll have your work cut out for you... when you conduct it. I'm not conducting it. You are. Me? Well, you trained at the Royal Academy. Yes, but I was a violinist, and that was years ago. Miss Pargiter, you read music. And Sir Thomas Beecham isn't available. Uhh-- After tea, we will go-- Use "shall." "Shall" is more refined. ...shall go to the member's stand... and vatch the-- And watch. And watch the gentlemen play the cricket. Yes! What are we gonna sing? I love Rudy Vallee. It won't be Rudy Vallee. Mrs. Roberts, what about you? Oh, my dear, I was a stalwart... of the Cathedral Choir of Singapore, and my husband Robbie was-- You have a lovely voice, Mummy. Well, perhaps I should consider it. Lovely. I'll put you down. Tan, Millie, you've heard about our choir. You'll join us, won't you? What kind of people will be in this group, dear? Mummy! What's wrong? I simply asked... what kind of people would be in this group. People like us, Mommy. Prisoners of the Japanese. But that's irrelevant, dear. One has a certain position. I mean, one can tolerate the Dutch, some of them, but-- Mummy, I-- What is it, Celia? Try to finish your sentences. Do you remember Wing? Well, of course I do. Horrible business. Horrible. But who knows what kind of contraband... she was trading in? I mean, probably some Oriental-- Quinine, Mommy. She'd gone to get quinine for you. You know what Colonel Hirota said... about writing anything. They find that, they could execute the whole bloody lot of us. Perhaps we're all being put... in a precarious position, Adrienne. Perhaps. I happen to think... it's worth risking. Oh! The Japanese will only find out if somebody says something. And what's that supposed to mean? Somebody tells them every time one of us... rolls over in bed. You've always got plenty of cigarettes. Do you think that-- I've never heard anything so insulting. Well, someone told them it was Wing... trading outside the fence that night. Well, it certainly wasn't me! What about that Jew doctor? What-What about that one? Always making eyes at that bloody guard. Susan, Mrs. Tippler, that's enough. S'truth! You were always... the shyest little thing at nursing school. Maybe nobody there ever got my goat. Well, then. Who's first? Um...Mrs. O'Riordan? If you would. * Ah * [ Hums Scale Slightly Off Thank you. And... Mrs. Cronje. Mrs. Cronje, would you, please? * Ah * [ Hums Scale Confidently ] Quick. Hide it. Aah! Oh, God. Eh, I reckon... she's gonna be all right, Mrs. Roberts. She might have... a bit of a funny bark. Thank you, dear. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Oh, Tillie, come and have some water, dear. [ Continues, Indistinct ] You okay? Okay. No, not so okay, but I breathe, so it's not so bad. I think you might have a touch of malaria. I might be able to get some...quinine. I'll get some whiskey. Cures everything. So, after the war, darling, you go to medical school, yes? Me? Yes, you. Why not? You know, my father'll want me back at the station. He never even wanted me to go into nursing. Station. He is a railway master? No. I was--it's a sheep station. It's like a farm. You do what you want, darling... not what your father want. He get plenty of those big Australian men... to work on the station. So. The Japanese end the ladies' choir... before it even begin. Oh, not at all. And it's a vocal orchestra, not a choir. But you can't possibly go on with it, not if they won't let everybody meet. It's only the large group that attracted the Snake's attention. You don't give a damn about us... the whole camp. I beg your pardon? Isn't all this just so you can lord it... over the rest of us, boss everyone around? The whole thing might be a bit... grandiose, Adrienne. I mean, how many women conductors... are there, anyway? None that I know of. Well. Well, then this is probably a first; something to be proud of. No. Excuse me, Mrs. Roberts, you were late. Oh, I don't think so, dear. Yes, Mrs. Roberts. You must watch me. I was watching you. Perhaps everyone else was early. No, Mrs. Roberts. Once again, everyone. * Ah * Hai! Hai! [ Shouting In Japanese ] Aah! Oh! Ohhh... boring man. [ Shouting In Japanese ] Aah! Oh! Ohh! Is there something we can do for you, Sergeant Tomayashi? Huhh! "Conner... Griffin... Munn." Well, it isn't just our orchestra women, is it? No. I can't see what it means. Do they have something in common? Some of the Dutch girls are on here, too. Well, repatriations? Executions? You're there, Rosemary. And Susan and Topsy. I know. God, what else could they do to us? It says the main gate after tenko. We'd better not go. We just won't go! Just say you have another engagement. Mistake. They'll do something awful... if we don't go. I know what this is. What? This is all the younger girls-- all the more attractive ones. Am I on there? No! No!No! This is Japanese Officer's Club. This is Japanese officer men. Most were educated and refined. Some speak English... like Englishmen from Oxford. What rubbish. Japanese officer look for volunteer... to work in club. Volunteer have plenty of food... and satin sheet. And we're the acceptable volunteers? That is correct interpretation. Disgusting, is what I call it. I'd rather kiss a leper from Leopoldville... before I let any of that lot touch me. Well, we don't have to stay. They're not forcing us. Right. Our own satin sheets? Ladies who stay in beautiful house... will please to walk in direction indicated. No. You can't be serious. Too right I am. You know bloody well... we've got Buckley's chance... of getting through the war... in that camp. You think I want to end up... in some shallow grave... in Sumatra? The war's going to be finished soon. You said that over a year ago. Bett! Bett! Hot water. Ahem. Is there hot water in this club? Plenty hot water. Plenty soap. Soap! Soap! It's been so long. Oh... Topsy, don't be absurd. Japanese officers gonna be any worse... than most of the creeps we've all known? Probably. What about Marty? Well, what he don't know-- Then what about the vocal orchestra? I'll be an alto short if you go. Are you asking me to give up food and soap... and God knows what else, so I can starve and sing?! Yes. I suppose I am. Lady... please. A good Catholic sister like you. I just can't believe you're not more-- Censorious? I'm not their judge. If they want to survive, maybe they will this way. The will to survive is very strong, stronger than anything. I just can't believe what you're saying. Very well, Phyllis. I've just lost four sopranos in that lot. You're going to have to join us now. I'm not interested in your bloody choir. Well, you could stop lying around and whinging... and jolly well get interested. Well. What about you two? Oh, no, not me. I-- Susan? Look, to be honest, I don't like the kind of music you're doing. It's got no tune. You really don't know... what you're talking about. No? No. All right, now, altos, it's two notes. * Mmm * * Mmm * * Mmm * All right? Ahem. * Mmm * * Mmm * Yep. How many do you have today? Two. I found them both just staring up... like this. Just wait till Mrs. Van der Weyden dies. She's so big with beri-beri, it will take 10 women... just to carry her out of the hut. Yeah. We'll have to jump on her... to get her in the coffin. Dr. Verstak? Yes. Over here. So, how it goes, the English ladies' choir? I can't tell. Lots of starting and stopping, it seems. Not much singing. You sound very disapproving. Oh, but I'm not. It will keep the ladies busy, and that is good, but the noise they will make ! It is not for someone... who's heard the great choirs of Leipzig... and Vienna. What are you doing? You're pulling out their gold fillings. Quite right, my dear. They are of no further use to their owners. You should not be so squeamish... with all that you have seen. I think this takes the cake. So this is how... you get your whiskey and cigarettes. That is so, and the small amount of medicine that we have. How do you think we get that, the Japanese give it to us? I trade with the guards. Ah! Amazing how strong. Anyway, it's best you know all this... in case something happen to me. What do you mean? I should carry on doing this? Only if you want some of the ladies in the camp... to stay alive. Ah! So what do you sing? Oh, um... it's all stuff I've never heard. Oh, uh, some... The Dvorák? Yeah. They sing Dvorák? Yes, that's it. You don't know Dvorák? What? They don't teach you anything in Australia? Only about sheep? Aah! Aah! Uhh! I have perhaps seen you before. I think not. I think so. The insolent lady to whom I gave a ride. Japanese soldiers never attack women. You refused to bow to him. He struck you on the face, quite rightly, then you struck him. No. He was drunk. I could smell the sake. He grabbed me from behind-- Silence! Uhh! [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Speaking Japanese ] Colonel Hirota say incident with the lady... most regrettable, but is death for strike Japanese soldier. Lady have very bad manners. Manners very important to Japanese people. [ Speaking Japanese ] That is all. You're starving and beating woman and children. You steal our Red Cross parcels for yourselves. You don't give us any medicine for the sick, not even the quinine for the bloody malaria everyone's got. You make us work like slaves. You don't even let us write to our families, and you have the cheek to sit there... and lecture us on good manners! Tomorrow, lady will be executed. Please, please! You tell Colonel Hirota that I saw what happened. The Colonel knows that I'm a nun, and nuns never tell lies. The lady only raises her hands... to protect herself. Like this, and then she hit him by accident, and he fell back into the latrine. Colonel Hirota say he regret, but the incident all dealt with by Captain Tanaka. Captain Tanaka with Kempei-Tai. So Captain Tanaka is in charge of this camp? I understood it was you, Colonel Hirota. Two broken ribs is not so bad. Better than... [ Imitates Knife Cutting ] Yes? You will not be able to move around... for maybe a week, maybe two. That's impossible. Everything's arranged for Saturday. It's our anniversary. Anniversary? We've been here two years. Oh... what an anniversary. Well, you do as you like. I'm only the doctor. I told a lie, but God will forgive me. I think He will even congratulate me. I have some medicine. Come. Cheers. Oh! Sister. Whiskey? I love whiskey. I'm a nun, not a saint. And you, are you a saint? No, no. That would make me fall over. Oh, I've never drunk whiskey before. Let us hope that you do worse things... in your life, darling. Prost. Bottoms up. Prost. Faith, you can do very little with it... and nothing without it. Cheers. Yes, Japanese whiskey, not scotch. Still, we can't have everything. You got some lipstick? Orange? All the rage in Palembang. Look! Oh! Look at these! Oh, gee, it's been a long time since I kissed a man. There's nothing nicer. Only one thing. Oh? Heh heh heh!Heh heh! You look lovely, Helen. Some man will be very lucky one day. Not if we stay here. Then we meet no one. We shall not meet anyone. Shall. But we won't stay here. One day we shall all go home. Ja. There's gonna be trouble. Japs won't take this lying down. Come on. I'm fallin' down like an old house. Would you look at me legs? They look like that little wooden man. Pinocchio. Aye. That's the fellow. Uh-oh. Winner... of the 1944 Dale Carnegie Charm School Award, Tokyo division. You! No go! Stay! Topsy. You like? [ Man Speaking Chinese ] It's for you from Chinese man. "My darling, I hope this finds you well. "I'm in the camp at Talang-Batu. "I'm escaping with some of the Aussies. "See you in Sydney. Hotel Australia. All my love." Bugger the emperor. Bugger the emperor. Edna? Yeah. Fancy having a flag with a poached egg on it. Colonel Hirota proud to report further victory... of Japanese armed forces. American imperialists... removed from many Pacific Island, and Australia bombed many times. Australian government... want to make peace with Japan. That'll be the day. Churchill and Roosevelt, number 10. Emperor Hirohito, Son of Heaven... number one. You! You! Come here. Oh, no. Woman: At least it's not me. You spoke. What did you say? I said, "Warm, isn't it, for this time of year?" [ Speaking Japanese ] Sorry. When you say to Captain Tanaka... that all wars end, you tell him that perhaps the invincible Japanese army... will lose this one. Who knows? And if they do, his treatment of this young woman... will not result in the Allies... building any shrines to him. Maybe they even hang him. Yes. I do not think you are in a position... to threaten Captain Tanaka. Not a threat. Advice only. I'm his ally. You tell him. I think it's impossible. Oh, I can understand this, but, you try... yes? Uhh! Lift her up. Oh, my dear... that's one to tell your grandchildren. Oh, I knew he was bluffing. Yeah, show-off. It's just humming, that's all. Anybody could do that. Miss Drummond. Come. Bravo! Marvelous. I loved it. Woman: Brava! Do you know, Miss Drummond, I just realized I don't know your Christian name. It's Daisy. I've always hated it. I wish to be called Margaret. Well, then, Margaret it is. Why not? A gift... from Colonel Hirota. Soap. Oh, thank you. Oh, this will go a long way among 300 of us. Colonel Hirota say you will please to sing... one Japanese folk song. Tell him no. Oh... but this is very difficult to say. Tell him my appreciation of the Japanese culture... is at a low ebb. I think I make some other reason. As you wish. You don't hate them, do you? Why not? I've tried, but I just can't... bring myself to hate people. The worse they behave, the sorrier I feel for them. Are you comfortable, Mrs. O'Riordan? I'm all right. Gently. No go! Boys no go! Too big. Go men's camp. What? No! Mom, please! It'll be all right! Don't let anybody push you around. Ugh! So, Mr. Tomio... where are we going now? Yes, what's happening? I don't know. I think you do know. No, I don't. Tell us something, Mr. Tomio. Be a man. General MacArthur back in Philippines. Chase Japanese soldier all over place. Try it. Ohh! I always wanted to be an engineer, but my father wanted me to be a nun. Don't worry. I love God, even though I sometimes wonder what he's doing. Here. Arigato. If my guys are coming, why don't the Japs just go... and leave us here? I don't think they've ever done anything... that made much sense. It's the satin sheet brigade. I knew I should've joined that bunch. I think maybe we all should've. Up there is the mountains of Loebok Lingau. My father would take us there... in the summer. In the jungle, there are many tigers. At night we close all the windows and doors, or they come in the house. I lie there and I hear them... walk up and down the verandah. Pom, pom. So heavy they are. I can hear them breathing... through the other side of the shutter. One morning, I opened the door... and a big tiger is sleeping on the front stoop. Oh. Ahh. I spent my summers... at my family's home in Dorset. No tigers. Just rain. Soft days, we called them. That's where I met Dennis. We were 17, and he was my school friend's brother. I thought he was the best-looking boy... I'd ever seen, but it took him so long to kiss me, I thought it was never going to happen. And then it did? Oh, yes! Ha ha ha! We were in my father's study. I nearly fainted. We were so young, they didn't want us to see each other, so we pretended we weren't in love. So you keep seeing each other? Oh, yes. We didn't fool anybody. I realized love is like a flame. It burns and is visible to all. Ah. Be careful. Are you all right? Is Susan here? Ugh! If I ever get out of this, I'll never say a word against New Jersey. You'll never get out of this. None of us will ever leave Sumatra. Come on. A little towards me. That's it. Snake! Aah! Where? Snake. Kill it. We'll eat it. Aah! Don't give up now. Dennis vouldn't want that. Wouldn't. Rosemary, remember, we are going to Lord's... to watch the gentlemens play cricket. Then we have some tea. Snake's not so bad. The grasshopper's delicious. Wonder what Bing Crosby's up to now. Bing Crosby? Why? I miss him. That's all. Beaut he is, Bing Crosby. We must get the orchestra started again. We've got to have a rehearsal. Oh. Yes, of course, Margaret. Show the Japanese we're still alive. Still got some spirit left. That bloody choir. Totally exhausted everyone. They won't be able to find enough people now... for a barbershop quartet. Oh, shut up, Harriet. Shut up? You were bullied into joining by Adrienne. That's true. Best thing that ever happened to me. Here you are, Mummy. Mummy, you have to eat something. No, dear. I really don't mind dying. No. I learned a great deal in the camp. I did nothing, you know, in Singapore. Mummy, you're not going to die. Yes, dear... I am. I'm really sorry that I won't see... your dear father again. I have so much to tell him. So much. Doctor. Rosemary. The beautiful English girl. Paradise Road. Tomorrow... perhaps tonight. Sometimes God reaches down... and pulls the wings off his butterflies. Wh She doesn't want to live anymore. Perhaps now she realizes the world is not a place... where lovers are reunited and good always wins. She saw her husband at the railway yard. The great love affair. I can't say I'd pine away after any of my husbands. If I fall in love, then I hope it is like that. Good luck, my dear. "Father, in captivity... "we would lift our prayer to Thee. "Keep us ever in Thy love. "Grant that daily we may prove... "those who place their trust in Thee, more than conquerors may be." "Give us patience to endure. "Keep our hearts serene and pure. "Grant us courage, charity, greater faith, humility." "Readiness to own Thy will, be we free or captive still." Amen. All: Amen. Amen. What are you doing? The French eat snails, don't they? Yes, but I think those ones will make you sick. I'm here, Margaret. You can't die now. Not now. She's asking for something. "The Lord is my Shepherd. "I shall not want. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. "He leadeth me beside the still waters. "He restoreth my soul. "He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness... "for His name's sake. "Yea, though I walk through the valley... "of the shadow of death, "I will fear no evil, "for Thou art with me. "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. "Thou preparest a table before me... "in the presence of mine enemies. "Thou anointest my head with oil. "My cup runneth over. "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me... "all the days of my life, "and I will dwell... in the House of the Lord forever." That's what I wanted. Amen. The war... is over. Who won? Once more... we can be friend. I have done my best for you. I know... not enough. But I could do no more. Woman: We weren't number 10. Oh, Tillie! Does this mean... it's back to picking up groceries, laundry, and all that? My God! For you, my dear. For me, it is luxury hotels... and limousine cars. Yes. Dr. Verstak. Yes, Macarthy. Are you really a doctor? Yes and no. My husband is a medical doctor. I'm Doctor of Philosophy. I hurt no one. Maybe I help. Is wanting to survive so bad? Susan. Dear Susan. Well... we made it. Yes, we did. Some of us. I can't believe it! [ Vocal Orchestra Performs Londonderry Air ]
