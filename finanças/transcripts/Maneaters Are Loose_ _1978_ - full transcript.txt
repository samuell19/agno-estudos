- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. (cat meows) Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. (dramatic music) - What'd I tell you about that cat? - It's just a sip of milk, Toby, left over. - If he's too good to hunt mice, it's time to wring his neck. Man shall have dominion over all the beasts of the land and the fowl of the air! (door slams) (footsteps approach) - Nice the weather's changing, huh? - Penny, you'll get pneumonia, your body all exposed. (Penny sighs) (cat meows) - [Penny] Hello. (laughs softly) Less clothes you wear, the bigger tips you get. (cat meows) (smooches) - I thought you were gonna ask her for a board and broom. Or do you want me to? - What for? - Don't worry, just for show. You always get it back, with interest. - Yeah. You know what I'd like to do someday? I'd like to walk right up to that pulpit and tell all those good people in the God's Fellow Church, Do you wanna know how good Deacon Toby Waites raised his poor little juvenile delinquent he took in on state aid? Remember when? - I've been good to you. - Likewise, I'm sure. (engine revs) (chickens bawking) - I'm tellin' ya that we've gotta be careful. - Tommy boy, when my friend designs a building there's enough in it to pay everyone. - I-- - And enough left over for a couple of old fraternity brothers, huh? - All right. By the way, old fraternity brother, don't forget our chess game tonight. - (laughs) Look who's talkin' about careful. You know, if May ever catches on to your little chess game, I'm gonna wind up with egg on my face while you're off with some little, who is it this time? That little cocktail waitress? - Don't worry about May. She's convinced she's turned me into a clean-cut celibate over the years. She's put me in escrow. - I have the folder right here. Well, no. Actually, the appraisals here have risen in Whitford in the last year. Mm-hm. No, moving the county seat to Scarby has actually increased the values. But Whitford will continue to have a fire station and a sheriff substation. Now, if you're really interested in this house, Mr. Gilbert, I would make an offer before somebody snaps it up at the asking price. - If I had my way, we'd close down this cruddy substation, and I'd move all you goldbrickers back to Scarby headquarters so I can keep an eye on you. We get you long-haired slack-offs from the big city in through here all the time. You take a job, you're gonna do us hicks a big favor, and you think it's gonna be some kind of a vacation. With pay. - Strange. (sighs) When I was recruited for this job before the last election, Sheriff Rondel billed me as an outstanding investigator, who would bring professionalism to the department. - Sheriff Rondel runs for office. And I run the department. - I do my job, Hale. - Mr. Hale. I'm the sheriff of this county. As long as you last in this job, Gosford, I want a daily report of your activities, or inactivity. And of your progress. Or lack of it. And another thing. Any news whatsoever comin' out of this department is to be released by my office only, and not to that cigar-chewing ex-drunk out there. (Gosford sighs) - Jim Taggert's a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Hale. - Well, I didn't give it to him. I don't give prizes, Gosford, I give orders. And from now on, every case you're on is to be considered strictly confidential 'til I say different, you got that? - Alright. - I really enjoy the new office building over in Scarby. But I guess you'll have to stay here and take the heat like like this, won't you, Gosford? - Depends on hot it gets. If I were you, I'd take it. - Guys like you always take the heat. Fall into a pattern. Let's see, you go to law school. Drop out. So, then you retreat into the police department. But when the time comes for you to take your lieutenant's exam, you don't even show up. Right? Patterns. You surprised? I do my homework, Gosford. It'd pay you to remember that. - What's new, John? - Well, you're gonna have to check with him from now on. - Hmm. That's how it is, huh? - That's how it is. - How are you, David? Good to see you, big man. You're looking good. - Thank you. - Yeah. Nice dog, nice houseboat. - Never knew you liked to fish. - I never did. Looks like a real good spot for it, though. You found yourself a real, real beautiful spot here, David. (David laughs) - How'd you find me, McCallum? - No, no, no, no. Me first, okay? When are you going to accept yourself for what ya are? - Well, I already have. (McCallum scoffs) That's why I'm here. - Well, it turns out that I have to admit you're about the best we got, and it looks like we need you back. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's the only profession in the world where to be the best you gotta be the worst. - No, no. - Well, I meant it, Mack. No more. - Wait, wait, wait. - I'm through. - David, David, look. Listen to me. You and I together have tracked down, well, probably some of the most elusive-- - Well, go ahead and say it. Targets. - Targets. Most elusive targets in the world. We're pretty good at it. - We're dinosaurs, Mack. Our days are numbered. Already passed, probably, we don't even know it. - You know what I'd hoped? I'd hoped that this time you're taking off here, you'd (clicks tongue) become a little bit more realistic. Not so poetic. (dog barks) - Realistically, where does it all end? This business of reducing the solution to all things to the little X in the crosshairs of a sniper scope? You know, Mack, I've had a dream. Clear as crystal. I see myself framed in those crosshairs. It's no lie, that's realism. There I am. A little X across my back, just below the shoulder blade. No sound. Just a deep, hot pain. Right there. No more, Mack. No more. (car rumbles) (soft groovy music) (contented sighing) - Tom, aren't we ever gonna stop? I'm tired of driving. (giggling and smooching) - Don't leave teeth marks on me. - One night I'll mark ya good, then what? (Tom chuckles) - Then I'll have to explain how I was attacked by this wild animal. - (giggles) Well, if you don't stop pretty soon, it won't be a lie. - I'm just playin' it safe. (soft giggling) (tires squealing) - Watch out! - That crazy fool. I'll break his drunken neck. - Hey. Terrific, now how is that gonna look, huh? (drunken mumbling) - Pound the guy, yeah, wouldn't that've been somethin'? (exhales deeply) - If you wanna tangle with somebody, how about tanglin' with me? (giggles) - Take care of my babies. Hey you, up there. You hear me? Oh, what's the use? Ain't no god up there. They're all yours now. You'll take care of 'em. (mumbling) (rattling) Yeah, yeah. They're all yours now, yeah. (smooching) - What would you do if you went home one night and your wife had some candles on the table and some wine and she wanted some romancing from you? (Tom chuckles) - No chance. - No? - May only makes love in months with a Z in them. (both laugh) - Good. - Mohan. Yeah, he's the dumb one. Yeah. You've gotta take of him. He's a good boy. And Ronnie, she's, oh god, she's gonna have her babies tomorrow or the next day. You've gotta take care of my babies. That's all I got. Here. Can't starve ya anymore. (creaking) Come on, boy, come on, boy. (tense music) - [Penny] Hey, where do you think you're goin'? - I'm goin' to get some air. - I know where you're goin'. - You do? - Uh-huh (giggles). Hey, don't go too far. (music grows more suspenseful) (low growling) (snarling) (music intensifies) (low growling) (music swells) (music quickens) (Tom screams) (unsettling music) Tom? Come on, Tom, quit kiddin' around. Come on, I want to get goin'. Tom? Tom? (music swells) (music grows more suspenseful) Tom? (music turns tense) Tom? (music grows ominous) Tom? Tom? (growling) (music intensifies) (Penny screams) (engine revs) (loud growling echoes) (dog barks) - My god. I never thought I'd hear that sound again. Tigers. Two of them. (telephone rings) - Hello? - George, I hate to bother you again, but Tom isn't home yet. Have you heard anything? - No. I assumed he'd be snuggled safely by your side by now, May. - (inhales deeply) I know he drinks on your chess nights. (faint twangy music) Are you sure he didn't have one too many? - May, he sipped one highball all evening. Do you want an affidavit? - I'm sorry I asked. I'm just concerned, that's all. - Look, don't worry. Tom can take of himself. Maybe he had car problems. Don't worry. The sheriff's department says no fog, no accidents. Relax. (engine revs) (tires squeal - I wonder, could you check with them again? - Oh, why don't you call them, May? - I don't want it to sound as if-- - Okay. I'll call you back. (unsettling music) (door closing) (music grows more tense) - Took your time. There's your money, plus. Jezebel. Daughter of Satan. Corrupter of men. - (gasps) No, no. - What do you mean, no? I couldn't-- - I said no. Get out of my room. - So, you've been with someone else already. - Now, you get outta here. Don't you threaten me. - Who have you been with tonight? - I haven't been with anybody. Now, get outta here. Or I'm gonna start screamin'. (door slams) (sighs) (faint country music) ♫ Let it rain ♫ Let it rain on (singing drowned out by car rumbling) ♫ Rain on this goodbye ♫ Make it blue (singing drowned out by car rumbling) ♫ Goodbye ♫ Today ♫ Kiss me goodbye - Miller? - [Miller] Go ahead. - I've got an abandoned car on Cullington Drive. Looks kinda fishy here. Could you get me a make on California four eight seven bravo alpha kilo? - Where'd you say it was? Mmm-hmm, yeah, well, I'll talk to ya later. Okay, so long. (sighs) - What was that all about? (sighs) - (sighs heavily) The honorable county treasurer Thomas Purcell's car was found abandoned with the radio on. - (groans) The honorable Thomas Purcell is gonna run his battery down. (faint country music) ♫ That lazy goodbye ♫ Let it rain - I suppose Mr. Hale is going to want a written report before morning. (John sighs) (thudding) - I told you, you ever mention Hale's name in the bedroom, of all places, and you're in big trouble, right? (groans softly) - Now that I'm awake, (John laughs softly) and this is the bedroom. (both laugh) - Oh, you'll impede law enforcement any way you can, won't ya? Coffee. Sex. How 'bout an omelet? (woman laughs) (growling) (dog barks) - What the hell's goin' on out there? - Hi John. - Hasn't been around, huh? - No. (John groans) - You know the county treasurer's wife, Mrs. Purcell? - Yeah, just by sight. - By sight would you say this is her style? (officer chuckles) - No, not Miss Prim and Proper. - She's not the type that undresses in the back of a car, huh? - No, I wouldn't guess that. - Well, it looks like you and Miller are right, Fred. Mr. Thomas Purcell has disappeared under very suspicious circumstances. Not unique. But suspicious. Ah, I got myself on the short end of the stick of a very touchy (sighs) political problem. All I need. (dog barks) (dog barks) - Mr. Gosford, you asked me over here to discuss the disappearance of my husband. I see no reason why we should waste time trying to find clues in my married life. I know police savor such things, but, could you move that-- - [John] Everything's okay at your house, then? - Yes, yes. Things might be okay at your house. Our home life is exemplary. - He left this George Leppard's home quarter to 11? - Yes, yes, that's what George said. - Do you have reason not to believe him? - (laughs) None whatsoever. It's just that George is a bachelor. They lead very unprecise lives. He might have been mistaken about the time. - He always goes over there on his chess night? - Yes, I encourage it. It's a outlet. - He always goes over to Leppard's house, though. - Yes. - Never at your house? - No. - Why is that? - I don't see what this has to do with anything. - Well, usually chess buddies switch back and forth. Unless, of course, there's some reason. - Are you suggesting that there's some sort of a homosexual relationship going on? - No, ma'am. That never crossed my mind. - The reason is very simple. - The reason that they play at Leppard's house, you mean? - Yes, yes. We don't drink at home. We don't even keep liquor at the house. - Oh. - Well, I don't enjoy it. And since I contribute to our joint income, we decided a long time ago there was no need to spend money on something only one of us enjoys. - I see, I see. Well, I would think that he probably a little snort or two over there on his chess night, yes? - I'm sure that he has a highball or two over there, yes. But if you think that he was just, well, just drunk and wandering around falling down drunk. - No, no. - And walked away from his car-- - As a matter of fact, Mrs. Purcell, I don't think he disappeared where we found the car. There were no men's footprints moving away from it. - Tom knows that I would never tolerate that kind of self-indulgence. His position and responsibility forbids any such behavior. Oh, I know you police would just love some kind of seamy explanation, but I can assure you that my husband was the victim of some kind of foul play. Why are you staring at me like that? - I find it odd, Mrs. Purcell, that you prefer to think of him as either being robbed, or mugged, or murdered instead of just sleeping it off under some tree somewhere, that's all. - You are out of line, Mr. Gosford. I have to warn you that I have a position in this county. And I am well-acquainted with the sheriff and Undersheriff Hale. If I were you, I would be very careful that in your investigation you didn't plant any filthy insinuations. I'd be very careful. (telephone ringing) (growling) (dog barks) - Anybody report a missing girl this morning, Parker? - No, sir. Anyone in particular? - Yeah, one in particular, but I don't know which one yet. - I'll let you know as soon as I find out then. - Well, you and Purcell went to the same college, right? - The same fraternity, yeah. Tom was in business administration, I was in architecture. - Hmm. Fraternity handshake comes in handy later on, doesn't it? - What's that supposed to mean? Look, just because my firm has been successful on a few county contracts doesn't give you the right... - All I meant was, you wouldn't be covering for an old fraternity brother, would ya? - Cover up? - May Purcell runs a pretty tight ship, I hear. - May is a fine woman. Highly successful in her own right, you know. - No, but I mean she goes to bed with her coat on. - I wouldn't know about that. - Who was your friend playing around with on the sly? - Tom? - Yeah, Tom. He was with a girl last night as a matter of fact. - Tom was with me last night. - He was with you until a quarter of 11, Leppard. After that he was with some girl. Her fingerprints are all over the car. Her black hose were in the backseat of the same car. - Look, I helped-- - I am not the custodian of public morals, Leppard. If you're trying to cover up for your buddy, you'll make it a lot tougher to find him. You understand that? - Look here, if Tom had a woman on the side, he certainly never mentioned it to me. I have to go. I have a client meeting in half an hour. - Yeah, well, whether it's a longstanding diversion or just a little one night's fling, I'm sure she's a local girl. - Oh? - Yeah. - And this is a small place, Leppard. When we find her, I think she's gonna have a lot of things to tell us, right? (tense music) (curious music) (dog barking) (music grows more unsettling) (crowd chattering) (music grows more tense) (excited chattering) - Well, Detective Gosford. - Hi Jess. - Long time. - Yeah, yeah, how about a glass of water? - What's the crime of the day? - The prices on your menu, Jess. Mira in back there? - Back in the office. (soft piano music) - Thanks. (glass clinks) (crowd chattering) (knocking) - Hi Mira. - John Gosford, what a pleasant surprise. - Thank you, it's good to see you. - You don't look comfortable, Johnny. That's bad. - Tom Purcell, does he come in here often? - Sure. Tom Purcell comes in here once in awhile for lunch. Business friends from his office. He's a tuna salad and vodka martini. (laughs) They think the fish covers the booze. Works just the opposite, you know. - Yeah. His wife, he doesn't bring her in here, does he? - May Purcell doesn't care very much for me, I'm afraid. I'm really not her type. - Yeah, I can see why. Tom Purcell was playing around with one of your waitresses, Mira. Which one? - Why don't you ask him? - Well, I would if I could find him. He was (inhales deeply) goin' at it in the backseat of his car with one of your girls just before he disappeared. Now, I'm a happily married man, Mira. But I never miss a pair of legs in black hose. And this is the only place I know of around here that they wear these. - Stupid little hustler. I warned her about fooling around with the customers. - Who is it? - Penny Halpern. - I don't know her. - She's had problems ever since she was a kid. The court turned her over to the Toby Waites out on Liberty Mills Road when she was 14. For a little bible-thumping upbringing. - Yeah, well, I don't wanna preach to her. I just wanna talk to her. Would you go out and get her, please? (energetic suspense music) (music turns unsettling) - You're not gonna believe this, but she pocketed her tips and took off. She told Jess she had a headache. - All right. It's a day for headaches, isn't it? Thank you. (curious suspenseful music) (rattling and clanging) (music grows more troubled) (music intensifies) - God is our strength and our salvation. May the good lord look down on our sister Jarvis, and bless her with his goodness and his mercy. Amen. - Bless you, bless you both. (curious music) - That's Toby. That teacher. (giggles) I don't believe it. Whee. (laughs) (unsettling music) (giggles hysterically) (vocalizes glee) (music swells) (suspenseful music) (car door slams) (music intensifies) (rapping) (music softens) (sighs) - This is Gosford. - Go ahead. - (sighs) Get out an APB on Penny Halpern. 21, 5'4", light hair. She's driving a maroon Mustang convertible. DMV can get you the license. Wanted for questioning. - Yes, sir. - And get an officer out to the Waites Farm on Liberty Mill Road on the double, and tell him to dress for some heavy weather comin' in right now. - Roger. Mr. Gosford, there's a fellow at the station to see you. Name of David Birk. - Well, what does he want? - Somethin' about tigers. - Tigers? - Yes, sir, he said tigers. Said he wants to talk to the head man. - Well, you tell him you're the head man. I'm no longer there at the moment. Just get the officer out here in a hurry, please. - Tigers? - Tigers. - Tigers? - That's what the man said. Tigers (mutters). (distant children playing) - Well, you're always complaining it's too quite. Somebody must have heard ya. - Well, the whole county doesn't have to go crazy at once, does it? We've got the country treasurer disappearing into thin air. Now his girlfriend does the same vanishing act, right. (snaps fingers) - Yeah. Then we got a deacon from the God's Pillar Church (groans) decorating his front yard with pornographic literature. (wife laughs) And some nut wants to talk to me about tigers. - Met some of the people from that church. They're nice people. - Yeah, well, I'm about to do those nice people a favor. - Gee, mister, your work sounds exciting. - You know, sometimes you're just a wiseguy. (Jill gasps mockingly) - That what's-his-name has gotta be kidding about tigers, doesn't he? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Officer, officer. What are you doing here? Is something the matter? - Well, I'm looking for Miss Penny Halpern. - She's working. Cullington Inn. - No, she's not there. - What do you mean? - She's not there, and we need to talk to her. - Go in and make some coffee, Edith. I'll take care of this. (thunder rolls) - Look, if you hear from her again, wou'll let us know, won't you? - Toby. Toby, I want you to come in here this minute. (door slams) (thudding) (Toby groans loudly) - It's gone! She took it, she took the money! - What money? - $4,000. I'll kill her, I'll kill... I was savin' it for us, us. You see. You don't think all of this stuff is mine? I was, we were collecting it. Evidence. Yes, for the police. Those bookstores in Whitford and Scarby. I'll get that little thief. Take her in, give her a good home, look after her. - Let her go, Toby. - Let her go? I'll show her! I'll kill her! Wicked! (thudding) Sinful! (thudding) Damnable! (thudding) Damnable! (crashing) (energetic suspense music) (thunder rolls) (car door slams) - Daddy, please. I'd be staying with the Wearings. - No, nothin' against the Wearings, but we just don't know anything about this theater group thing. - It'd only be for two weeks. (sighs) And school's out anyway. I could learn so much. - That's just it, Maudy, learn what? Your mother and I stayed up half the night talkin' it over. - You didn't talk it over with me. - [Father] You're only 16. - You don't trust me. You just wanna keep me a regular prisoner here. - Maybe next year. - There won't be any next year. - I used to feel the same way when I was your age. (sighing) - Okay, now, this Birk guy wasn't kidding, was he? - No, he came in talkin' about tigers. Left this note for ya. - Did he seem like a crackpot? - No, sir. He's guy who rented the houseboat. I've seen him a few times. He seems to keep to himself. - Detective Gosford, I am going from here to the district office of the Forestry Service to warn them of the discovery I made this morning. You can contact me there or later at my place. See if you can reach Peter Street over there at the ranger's station, will ya? I have reason to believe that two tigers are on the loose near here. They are probably from a zoo or animal attraction, and I suggest you contact such establishments immediately. The animals would not be adapted to conditions in the forest area, but might respond to someone with whom they are familiar. I doubt they present any immediate danger to humans, but every precaution should be taken. - Gosford calling from the Whitford substation. Hold a second. - Hello, Peter, John Gosford. - Hi John, I've been expecting your call. - Has David Birk been there? - [Peter] He was here, and he's gone. - [John] Well, what was your reading on the guy? - [Peter] Well, he sounded like he had all his marbles and 1/2 of somebody else's. But come on, tigers? - [John] Well, today's my day to believe anything. - [Peter] We got 60,000 acres out there. Campers and vacationers all over the place. - [John] Can you use some kind of excuse? Fire danger or somethin' like that? - [Peter] Fire risk is a fact. But come on, John, isn't there any way we can verify this? The tigers, I mean. - Tell you what. I'll go out to talk to this Birk guy. And maybe he'll sober up by the time I get out there, and we can call an all clear. I'll get back to you Peter, all right. Bye bye. (receiver clicks) (sighs heavily) You didn't hear anything. - No, sir. - Now, send a couple cars up there. Keep out anyone who has not set up camp already. Extreme fire hazard. - Gotcha. - [John] Then get on the phone. Call zoos, parks, animal attractions. Crazy millionaires who may have jungle pets. The library may help you with some names. - [Miller] Yes, sir. - I hear one word but tigers around here, you two are gonna be crossing guards in Cullington. You got that? - Yes, sir. - Come on, Maudy, don't cry. (sighs) Hey, I'll tell you what. Listen, if you want to, you can play act for me. - Leave me alone. - Well, I can be your audience Maudy. - (sniffles) Don't call me Maudy. I wanna be called Kim. - Okay. Kim. - You're sure it was tigers you heard? - No doubt about it. I waited 'til morning to look. Sound is tricky from around here. I figured a 1/2 mile or so. - Yeah. Well, I found the pugmarks, tracks. Site of a kill. Doe and a fawn. Pretty much finished the doe. The fawn he killed just because it was alive. He may come back to finish it later, though. - You an expert on tigers, Mr. Birk? - Well, you could say that. I was brought up in India. My father was quite a well-known hunter. I did a bit of it myself some years ago. Not for sport. The tigers I shot were man eaters. - (clicks tongue) Well, it's not that I doubt your word. But I would like to see it with my own eyes. - The sooner, the better. Right now if you'd like. - [Miller] Baker two, Baker two. Baker two, Baker two. - Baker two, go ahead. - Penny Halpern has been apprehended, being returned into custody now for your disposition, sir. - My disposition is getting worse by the minute, Miller. I'm comin' in. - Also, another message for your attention, sir. - You got my attention. What is it? - A Jed Haines called in. Said some wild dogs got into his sheep and killed a slew of 'em. Wants to know what we're gonna do about coyotes runnin' around the county. - Tell him to sit on it, I'm comin' in. You did say deer, not sheep. - I said I found a deer. I don't know about the sheep. - Well, I've got to go into town and question a witness about a disappearance. - What kind of disappearance? - (clicks tongue) Nothin', there was just an abandoned car on a side road near Cullington. Why? - I heard the tigers twice. But I wouldn't wanna guess. - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute now. You told me in that note that tigers were no danger to man, right? - I said they were no immediate danger. Generally the tiger avoids contact with human beings. He only becomes a man eater when he's wounded or old, or when the sight of an unarmed man looks like an easier meal than another animal. Which can happen when his normal source of food is taken away. - Well, give me a 1/2 hour to question the witness, (sighs) and meet me in town. If you're right-- - What do you mean if I'm right? My god, man, I'm not trying to be right. I'm trying to furnish you with enough factual information to take action. This area is full of people. - Look, I have superiors to talk to. I can't go around just starting a panic on the basis-- - Look, Gosford, if it's become a jungle out there, Gosford, the only two superiors around now are a couple of Bengal tigers. No more deadly animal exists. Outside of us. I wouldn't wait too long. (dramatic suspense music) (music swells) - Hey there, just a minute! It's all right, Penny, now. Edith must have reported it. Just a little misunderstanding. You can just give the money back, and there'll be no trouble, huh? No trouble at all. Deputies, I'm her guardian. - Guardian? (giggles) - Just a few words with her, all right? You understand, huh? - Okay, a couple minutes. - Now, look, Penny, we can work this out. You don't need to run off, huh? Sure, see. Now, here, tell you what. You give me the envelope. Just give it back. And you can even keep part of the money, huh? That's fair enough, huh? - Don't touch me. You dirty, filthy, stinkin' animal. They didn't arrest me for stealing your stinkin' precious money. (breaths raggedly) And I don't have your envelope. I threw it out the window with the rest of your stuff. They probably have it. I hope they make ya choke on it. Animal! Animal, animal! Animal! (sobs) - What's so important about the Haines Farm, anyway? - Oh, oh, Jed Haines called. He was all steamed out. Some coyotes came out and killed his sheep. Listen, Taggert, next time, could you stay here and let me cover the pool hall? - Coyotes? Lucy, baby, I'll pick up the photographer and cover the sheep, huh? - Oh come on, Taggert, if you're worried about my delicate sensibility-- - Now, you just take your delicate voice, and start making some phone calls. Now, you call the zoo, the circus, animal acts. Any place that might have tigers. - Tigers? Oh, I knew something was wrong when you started to chew on that cigar of yours. - (gasps) Dead wrong. Dead wrong. Now, Lucy, baby, you'll find out with mileage that every room has a slight ring to it. So just keep your ears finely tuned, huh? - Well, what is it? Oh come on, Taggert, give me a hint? - Well, if it's what I think it might be, the metros and networks will want yards of copy on this. Lucy, you might go from garden club and openings to big time bylines overnight. And it could very well be my return ticket right out of here. - Wait a minute, you can't leave me like this. What is it? - Well, it could also explain our missing treasurer, Mr. Purcell. (Lucy gasps) No. (tense music) (growling) - I don't wanna know about the money right now, Penny. - Well, he's got a lot of gull accusing me of anything, anyway. After those pictures you found. He shouldn't be pointing his finger at anybody. - All right, all right, we're gonna take care of that. I wanna know what happened to Thomas Purcell. - Tom? (laughs sharply) I never heard of a Tom Purcell. - I don't wanna know about your personal life. And I don't care what you've done right or wrong. All I'm interested in right now is knowing what happened to Thomas Purcell. You were with him last night. And it's likely you were the last one to see him. We don't believe he disappeared where his car was found. Now, I want the truth outta you. It's important that I know. Penny, there are some people's lives at stake. - Do mean that there really is? - Is what? - (gasps softly) A wild animal out there. (suspenseful music) (sighs) It was awful. At first I thought he was just kiddin', you know? And then (gasps) I heard these awful growls. And then (hyperventilates) he just never came out. (sobs) - It's okay. All right. Penny, it's okay. Now, I know this is difficult for you. Penny, I want you take me to the exact place you saw him last. Will you do that for me? (knocking) - Excuse me, sir. Carl called about a suicide. He's on his way over with some things he'd like you to take a look at. (tense music) - Well, you tell him to rest in peace for awhile. I'll be back in about an hour or so. (music swells) (frantic music) This is where you parked, right? - Yeah. - Where did you see the man last? (Penny sobs) - Where did you see him? - I saw him go into the woods down there. - Down there. - Cub, come on. Come. - Hey, look, are you gonna need that gun, you think? What do you think's gonna happen to somebody in there, in the woods. - Just show us where to go. Calm down, will ya, and show us where to go. Give us a direction. Come on. Where did he go? - (sobs loudly) In there, in there. - Come on. - Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) (Penny inhales sharply) Is this yours? (Penny sobs) (music softens) - Thomas Purcell. They don't leave much, do they? (Parker groans) - Parker. Parker, I want you to rope the area off, and don't let anyone in here until I get back here with the coroner. - Deputy, do you have a high-power rifle? - [Parker] Just the shotgun. - Oh, well, that's no good. You'd better post a deputy here in a car. Don't let anybody wander in that way if it gets dark. - What goes on here, anyway? - Tigers. - Tigers? Sounds more like bull to me. Now, Gosford, before you jump on your horse, and you run madly off in all directions at the same time, let me tell you what probably happened. That little twist of a girl too him up there in the woods for a little hanky-panky, and the damn fool had a heart attack and died. I expect the coyotes did the rest. - I saw the track, Mr. Hale. - Yeah, I know you saw tracks. Pointed out to you by this great tiger hunter that nobody ever heard of. Well, who's heard of him? Who is he? The tracks were probably laid down by a Great Dane, or a St. Bernard off somebody's campground. Now, you're not gonna start any abominable snowman or Bigfoot rumors, and make a laughing stock out of everybody in this county. That's the trouble with you big city boys. They get out here in the wilds, and they start seein' booger-men. (chuckling) - (sighs) Mr. Birk seems to know what he's talking about, and there are a lot of people up in those camp grounds. - Doggone right, there are. Tourist business's up 20% this year. He wants us to chase 'em all away. - No. - I told you that ashamed campaign the supervisors voted would work. - Stroke of genius, Jack. - Oh no, no, no. With all due respect, I don't mean chase 'em outta camp. - All right, just a minute. Just a minute. With all due respect, you direct your comments to me. - I just think we oughta notify the news media, the television people. - Absolutely not. - Well, we've got to prevent people from coming in there. - No. No, in no way are we gonna do that. Just look at the facts, will ya. If there were any wild zoo animals loose out there, we'd be the first ones to know about it. The zoo would call us. Oh, it's obvious what has to be done. I have to go up there myself, see what the situation is. If it does appear that there are any wolves or coyotes, or tigers, I'll put a squad of sharpshooters in there in the morning, first light. They'll flush the critters out and kill 'em. I'll put a squad of detectives on standby immediately. - Sounds sensible to me, Gordon. You can't go up half-cocked on things like this, Detective Gosford. Hale here's experienced in maneuvers of this sort. - Yeah, remember those breeding polls that got out this spring, Gordon? You guys were the best cowboys in the west. - Jack, come on by my office for a drink. - [Miller] You keep checkin' in from tiger land, Bud. - Okay, you guys, have your fun. Somebody's gonna have to relieve me sooner or later. - Now, you better get that idea right outta your head. (scoffs) I mean, runnin' away from home is kid's stuff, for Pete's sakes. I mean, they'd pick you up, they'd take ya in, and they'd hand ya a lollipop, and they'd pat ya on the head like some pet monkey. I mean, you want that? - For you to say. You're not stuck here. You've got a part time job. You've got your driver's license. You get to see people, do things. - All right, all right, listen Maudy. I'm gonna go see a flick tonight, all right. You can go, okay? - Don't call me Maudy, damn it! - And I told you not to cuss. - Maud Ethel. Sounds like some cheap gasoline. (groans in aggravation) I could just explode! (door slams) (suspenseful music) - Hello, John. - Hi Carl, come on in. - It's a suicide all right, like I told ya on the phone. The reason I called before is I found these deep scars in both arms and one leg. Years old. Thought he might be a felon from your files or something. When I found out it was a false alarm, I found this going through his things. That's him all right. And few less miles on him since that was taken. Somethin' wrong? - No. No, thanks, Carl. - [Carl] You bet. - See, it's Claude Davin. Alias, The Great Davino. He was fired two months ago, lock, stock, and tigers, from Safari Trek. I don't know, it's some sort of a jungle show. - Oh beautiful. (chuckles) Oh beautiful. All right, dry 'em off with the white blower just in case. - Do I win the prize? - You just may, Lucy, you just may. That is beginner's luck. (Lucy vocalizes satisfaction) It was years before I got my hands on one that big. Point for both of ya. Now, not a word. Keep the lid on. Now, nobody gets a sniff of what's cooking until I say so, huh? (Lucy sighs) (suspenseful music) (radio crackles) - [Miller] Okay, come in, Bud. - I'm gettin' out to stretch for a minute. So don't panic. (tiger growls) (engine revs) (tires squeal) (music swells) - I don't know how you got onto this, Taggert. But I can tell you one thing. If one word of this gets out, you will never work here or anywhere near here again. - Oh? It's a free press, Mr. Hale. - Not for you, it isn't. I happen to be a very close personal friend of your publisher. And I know how you stumbled into this town after a 10 year drunk in the big time. And you're just one drink away from being lech again. So don't make waves around here, mister, unless you wanna drown in 'em. (dog barking) Detective Gosford is relieved from this case, effective immediately. From now on he'll be working on arrests in the pornography case. Do you understand the order, Mr. Gosford? I'm taking personal charge of this matter, and I'll have a squad of sharpshooters in the woods in the morning. They'll handle these wild animals in a reasonable and orderly, logical way. Is there something that doesn't meet with your approval, Mr. Birk? - Well, if I were you, I would use all the help that Mr. Taggert can give you in spreading the word. And you do send sharpshooters into the woods in the morning, be careful. At least one of these tigers has tasted human flesh. Maybe both of them. They're man eaters now. They'll be the ones doing the hunting. - Human flesh? I'm supposed to believe that on the word of a thievin' little hustler and a deadbeater that's scared half out of his wits? Or drunk. Man eaters. Look, if this fella, what's-his-name, Gavin, Davin, that suicide, if he did release these tigers, there's a 10 to one chance that they're a couple of toothless old cats that he's used to entertain kids at birthday parties. Man eaters. I don't know what your game is, Birk. But you're not turnin' my county into a three-ring circus, you got that? - Well, Mr. Hale, if you go into the woods in the morning, be careful. Nothing would please these Bengals more than to have an easy meal from a full-grown jackass. (tense music) - [Man] I'll stop here moment, and you can jump out. You should see a doctor about your stomach. It could be serious. (door slams) (music grows more tense) (growling) (jarring note) (screaming) Ellen! (music swells) Ellen? (soft rumbling) - Take it on around back. (engine revs) Well, not a chance. She died on the way in. - What about the husband, can he talk? - Well, not now. He's in deep shock, and I've got him heavily sedated. He kept muttering something about a tiger. - Well, that's two, Johnny. What are you waiting for, an even dozen? - Get off my case, Jimmy. I'm not in charge of this. - You're damn right you're not in charge. A couple of blood-thirsty tigers are in charge of it. - You heard Hale, you were there. - Sure, I was there, I heard him. But he's back in Scarby now. He's watching a group of his deputies clean their uniforms, and polishin' their rifles, so they'll look pretty for his dawn patrol. Look, John, two people have been killed already. How many more are you gonna let get mauled tonight? John? Look, I'm over the hill with a lot of strikes against me. I've reason to be gutless, but what the hell is your excuse? - Here, wear this, it's warm. - Thanks. Better start packin' some dishes. I might be out of a job tomorrow. - So what? I'm used to packing. - So what, huh? - Mm-hmm. - I'll tell ya so what. We've been packin' and runnin' ever since we got married, baby. - Will you lighten up? Just lighten up, you're just tired. - (sighs) Of course I am tired, baby. I'm tired of runnin', if you wanna know the truth. I'm tired of this confusion that I'm feelin' inside. And I damn sure am tired of that confusion out there. - Stop playing games, will you? What is it you're trying to say? - Oh, I don't know. - What? - Hale is in charge because cop-outs like me let him. But not anymore, baby. No more packin'. And no more movin' for you. And that's a promise. (suspenseful music) (music intensifies) - All right, I want all the rest of ya to go to North Road, all the camp grounds in there, get those bonfires goin', and keep them lit all night, all right? - All right. - Remember, make sure they're in the clear. This area is like gasoline right now. Let's go. (excited exclamations) - It's just been confirmed by Detective John Gosford of the Whitford substation in Midland county that two tigers, apparently released by their former trainer, are roaming loose in the area and are believed to have killed a man and a woman in separate attacks. Visitors and travelers are warned to stay out of the wooded and rural areas. Deputies and forest rangers are warning those already in the area to take precautions. The first victim of the man-eating tigers has been identified as Midland county treasurer Thomas Purcell. Mrs. Ellen Fitch, attacked less than two hours ago, was pronounced dead on arrival at community hospitals. - Kevin, I'm worried. You know, Maudy doesn't know. I think she left before it came over TV. - Okay, mom, now listen, I don't want you to worry. 'Cause I'm gonna go out there, and I'm gonna find Maudy, okay? All right, but look for your father, because he's out there some place. - [Kevin] Okay, mom. (suspenseful music) - He's almost ready. These two, crop right there. And get a copy print on Davin if you can. - Okay. Here's an update for ya. Dateline Whitford. Tigers. (music intensifies) - [Parker] Hey. This is the creep that was in the porno pictures of Toby Waites, you know, the church deacon. - Who is he? Raymond Perth. The social science teacher from the high school. He was off to LA with his trunk full again with that garbage when we picked him up. We got it in the car. - You got the warrant? - Yes, sir. - Well, lock this one up and go ahead, get the other guy. - [Miller] Sir? - Now what? - Mr. Hale just called. He said if I saw you, I'm to tell you that you're suspended. But I haven't seen ya, have I? (unsettling music) ♫ I hear ♫ His dream ♫ Flow from down ♫ His mountain ♫ Amen - [Preacher] See here, officers. What's the meaning of this? This is a house of God. - We have a warrant for the arrest of Toby Waites. Now, Mr. Parker, why don't you and your deputy have a seat, and share in our service. - I'm sorry, sir, but we have to take him in now. - My righteousness will shine at the gates of Heaven. - That's fine, but right now we're taking you in for the producing and distributing of pornographic material. - Amen, God. Amen. (tense suspenseful music) - We've just come into sight of the national forest. And if there was any thought that this might be a hoax of some kind, it looks from up here as though the authorities are taking it seriously enough. Dozens of giant bonfires that you can see from our remote camera shot here are burning below. These, we are told, are a protective measure designed to keep the marauding tigers away from the many camp sites and farms in the area. (tense music) (tiger growls) (gun fires) (music darkens) (music turns emotional) - Damn. (growling) (music grows tense) - [Reporter] I heard a shot, too. What do you suppose is going on in there, Mr. Gosford? - [John] I'm really not sure. There's a man out there, Birk. I really couldn't tell ya. (suspenseful music) - [Reporter] What about these tigers, are they in the area around here? - They're in the area around here. That's the best I can offer. - [Reporter] Are these people in danger? - Well, we're all in danger as long as we-- - We've got a runaway girl. She must have missed the report on the tiger. Her brother says she's probably goin' through the woods to Scarby. He's gone ahead to look for her. - Thanks, Sy. (music swells) (growling) - Where are the rest of my deputies? Have you seen Detective Gosford? - He and a cop took off to look for the girl. - How were they armed? - The cop had a shotgun, I think. (crowd chattering) - Now, now, folks, there is no reason to be alarmed. Those two tigers are probably long gone by now. - Just one. I killed the other one a few minutes ago. Keep all these people near the fire. This one's gonna be tough to take. - If don't mind, Mr. Birk, I'll give the orders around here. You tryin' to panic these people? Now, now, there is no reason to be frightened. - There's plenty to be frightened about. All of ya, stay to the fire. - I told ya, keep your nose out of this. Unless you want to go back into town in the back of that black and white, you'll button up. - Night is when the tiger hunts, Mr. Hale, and this one happens to be a man eater. (tense frantic music) (growling) (music slows) - Maudy! Maud! (music quickens and swells) - Help! Help! Help! (shouts) Help! (yells) (cries out in fear) Help! Somebody help me! (sobs) Ow, my legs are stuck! Somebody help me! - Here she is over here! - Kevin, Kevin! - Darn you, Maudy! Get down here! (music swells) - [Maud] Kevin! (tiger growls) (Maud screams) Kevin! (sobs) Help! (music breaks) (growling) (gun fires) - [David] You all right? - [John] Yeah. - [David] Come on, now, here we go. - [Maud] (sobs) Kevin, Kevin. - [David] It's all right. Come on, she's still around. Let's get him up. (muttering) (dramatic music) - [Reporter] Bonfires are still burning like sentinels in the forest below. And it looks like one might have gotten out of hand. There's a slight wind picking up, and forest rangers were fearful this could turn into a blazing inferno. (sirens wailing) (music intensifies) All thought of the tiger seems to be forgotten now as this fire is going completely out of control. It'll be dawn soon. The roads are clogged with cars. Station wagons with their top racks dropping camping gear along the way. (horns honking) (siren wails) - How many you got up there? All right, Peter, well, don't panic. I'll get somebody up there to help you. Hold it, Parker. Gibbs Road, get all those people out of there right away. Now, move it. Move it. Jack, pull those first three of National Guard back into this parameter on A Road. And you've got two more units moving in. Gosford. I don't want you to think that you're gettin' by. You disobeyed a direct order of mine, and don't think I'm gonna forget that. - Let me tell you somethin', Hale. You're a good traffic cop. But as a human being, you are a pompous jackass. And you can shine your own boots from now on. Go to hell. (creaking) (motor rumbling) - Tiger, I saw a tiger! - All right, calm down. Where, where, where did you see it? - Caesar's Table. We were just riding under the bridge. It started after me. - You know where that is? - Let's go. Yeah. (suspenseful music) - Tell the rangers to have those two tanker bombers standing by. (music intensifies) (dog barks) Still around, you think? - I don't know, it's hard to tell. She's looking for a place. - A place for what? - She's scratching around the leaves and brush up there. She's trying to make a place to have her cubs. She looks about due to me. You better stay close to me just in case. - Better watch him, he's no tiger hunter. - Neither were you yesterday. - (Sighs and chuckles) Yeah, well. (tense music swells) (dog barks) (fire crackles) (plane rumbles) (dog barks) - Gosford, stop, she's in there! (tiger growls) (gun fires) (music turns emotional) How do you feel? (John sighs) (music swells with emotion) - The fire raged for three days before it was brought under control. 30,000 acres were burned. And at its height, the inferno was battled by more than 3,000 men. Now, the rest of it's gonna take months to sort out. A school teacher and a church deacon have been indicted in a pornography ring involving a dozen filth peddlers in LA. And the DA has uncovered a whole sewer full of officials tied into payoffs, and bribery, and school and government building contracts. Yeah, yeah, I've even got a happy side byline for ya. (chuckles) Detective John Gosford recovered from his wounds, and was awarded the Citizen's Medal for Bravery. He's now wearing his scars proudly as the newly appointed police chief of, what is that? Oh, Edgerton. Population: 30,000 people. And no tigers. (chuckles) Who? Oh, that Birk fella. No, it beats me. Just sort of disappeared. No one's seen hide nor hair of him. You know, as a matter of mater, Birk may not even be his real name. (bright lighthearted music) (music swells)
