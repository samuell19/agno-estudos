Every time at the critical moment, a man bearing a birthmark on the chest would save me, What does the doll look like? I think I've seen it before, but can't remember. I've seen it before somewhere. What does the man look like? Strange enough, every time I wake up, I can't remember his face. It’s like his face is blocked by fog. Mr. Jing, not sure if my understanding is right. You want me to clear up the fog, to see the person in your dreams, and sort of what the dreams are about, right? I'm a little worried that I might mix up my dreams with the reality. I don't think I'm in a good condition. OK, I'll start hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy?

In fact, I'm fond of this lifestyle. Though I'm lonely, it's also quite peaceful. By the way, I'm a spirit medium master. In the past we were called Fengshui Masters. Hairstyle ok, beard ok, face ok. Hello, who is it? Hello, is that Jing Ran? Ah, yes. Who is it? Ms. Li’s recommended you to me. Are you a Shaman Wizard? Yes, but I would like to correct you slightly. I'm a spirit medium master. OK Someone recommended you to me. Half a month ago you provided service to Ms. Li. Ah, I know. Please tell me what I can do for you. Then I can give you a quotation. 200 yuan for door-to-door ritual. 500 yuan for change of Fengshui. To drive out evil spirits… Don’t worry, money isn't an issue. As long as you can solve my problem, I'll pay you whatever amount. Then, Ms., what can I do for you? I think there's paranormal event in my house. Few days ago Ms. Li suggested that. I contact you, saying you're very good at this. Don’t worry. Since a friend introduced you, I'll see you as a friend as well. I'll treat this problem well and solve it. As for the payment… I know. I'll give you anything you say. OK, send your address to me. I'll head over later. Ms. Li, you're my angel. You're so good at doing business. After this, I'll always buy two porridges, though I'm only able to eat one bowl. Ping’an Apartment, No. 004 Yinyang Road. Who’d live at such a place? So far away, and with unlucky address. Mr. Jing, what’s wrong with my house? My throat's a little dry. Sorry, I totally forgot. I'll pour you a cup of water. No need. Let’s sit down and have a talk. Ms. Shen, please tell me what happened here? OK Are you the police? You seem young, go find something better to do. Huai, nonsense. Mr. Jing has his speciality. And you, a grown up playing with dolls? If you weren't a hassel, I wouldn't be here. Mr. Jing, I think you misunderstood. This is my niece, Shen Huai, not my son. Sorry, Ms. Shen. I'm busy with work, and often on business trips. After my son had some problems, I don’t want strangers taking care of my niece, so I let him stay here temporarily. This way I don't have to worry as much. Let's start. Please tell me the situation. My name is Shen Ru, manager of a beauty product company. I'm often on business trips, and I do a lot of overtime. I don't spend much time at home. I'm a single mom, living with my son. When I'm not at home, the nanny looks after my kid. Life has been peaceful. But since that day, Lele, listen to auntie’s, be good. Zhang, please take extra attention these days, make sure he studies hard, don't play for too long. Don't worry. Lele, be good. If you behave yourself, mom will buy you a toy plane. Little bastard, you don't like my cooking? I mistook the salt for sugar. It's nothing, just drink some water. If you don't want to eat, stand over there. Stand straight. Little bastard, you're so naughty. When your mom's away, I'll teach you a lesson. Did your mom beat you again? Yes. Don't you like your mom? Mom mom doesn’t treat me well. I don’t like my mom either. She's not home much. Nanny isn't nice to me. But you have me. If your mom beats you again, come to me. We're good friends. If the nanny beats you, I'll scare her away. Lele, who were you talking to? Why are you so quiet? You startled me. Mom, I'm scared. Nightmare again? Where's the toy plane you promised? Plane? What plane? I behaved very well these days. Lele, I'm sorry. Mom forgot. Tomorrow I'll find one on the Internet for you. Liay. Who? He called you a liar, hum. Mom, save me. Lele, why are you here? Mom, I'm scared. Why? Nightmare again? What was the nightmare about? The doll's mom came to get him. We ran, but his mom chased after us. Lele, where did you get this doll? When? Mom, don't you remember? The day we parted, dad said the doll would stay by my side. Lele, throw away that doll tomorrow. Listen to me. Have you taken your son to see the doctor? If the doctor can solve our problem, we wouldn't have to find you. We went to the doctor already, but the doctor said he's just a little introverted. Hello, does Ms. Shen live here? Who are you? I'm an astrology blogger and constellation master, Cai Yiling. Come in, please. I didn't expect you so soon. I couldn't wait. As soon as I heard, I came immediately. Cai Shanshan. Jing Ran. You know each other? Ms. Shen, don't you have faith in me? Why did you hire another person? And a half-ass person like her, won't be able to solve your problem. What did you say? Tricky problems are my speciality. Please stop arguing. Both of you were recommended by my friends. I just want to find peace in my home. The more help the merrier. Please don't let this bother you. No. Your temple can't have two buddhas. The atmosphere is quite gloomy here. Not good for females. Could you ask her to come back later? What a fool! I'm no ordinary girl. Besides, our era and technology are advancing. Chinese and Western approaches have emerged to drive away evil spirits. If your thoughts are so out-dated, so are your methods. Ms. Shen, please choose me. I have followed a famous master. I'm your right choice. I think I'm surrounded by frauds. I tell you you can drive away evil spirits. But if you dare play any tricks, I'll sue you. Sorry, my niece is quite stubborn. Please don't mind kids. Let’s sit. When can we start? Is your son home? No, he went to school, won't be back till this evening. Well? Let’s take a look at his room. This way, please. Wow, your son has a lot of clothes. Of course. Ms. Shen, where's that doll? My son took it to school. Could you give us for a moment? Sure. Jing Ran. Never thought we'd bump into each other. Destiny has brought us together. Then destiny must be a fool. This case is mine. Go back to where you're from. Don’t steal my case. You're just a constellation blogger, when did you start stealing our business? It's not easy to make money now, you understand. Be careful, or I'll let her see your true colors. Likewise. How about we handle this case together? Win-win situation? We can cooperate, and ask for more money. How about it? Let me tell you, if you disagree, believe me, I'll screw it up for you, too. Fine, fine. Cai Shanshan, destiny has played us. Save it. Can't afford rent, right? You have let out secrets, death will find you. Fine, what now? We need to act like it. Let’s start. Hello, friends. Welcome to my livestream. This is the crime scene. Where we will drive away the evil spirits. This industry isn't easy. Please give some rewards later. Now, join me in this eye-opening case. You have so many subsidiary businesses. You're also a livestream celebrity. Go away, don’t let your rag enter my screen, or my account might be blocked. If it's profitable, take me with you. I'm quite poor. Looks like we need to wait till tonight. It won't show without an appointment. You know nothing. It think highly of itself. Ms. Shen, we don't see anything abnormal now. But that room is quite cold and gloomy. It's be easier to identify at night. Yes. How about you two stay here tonight.? I have a meeting in another city tonight. I'm quite busy today. You can ask Shen Huai for help. Auntie, don’t worry. I'll threat them well. Make sure of it. Hey. Why did you agree so quickly? I wanted to go home. Then go. No, you'll steal the case. Don't be so suspicious. You think too poorly of me. Then what are you planning? Just wait and see. Shen Ru asked us to stay here herself. I was just thinking of an excuse. Tonight, we need to make sure if Shen Huai has a moon-shaped birthmark on his chest. It's late. Where should we sleep? I'll sleep in the living room. Then Mr. Jing can live in the master bedroom. I'll sleep with Lele. No no. Shen Huai can't sleep with Gao Le. You're afraid if I sleep with Lele, your plan will be ruined. See, why can't you say anything good? You're a grown man, your atmosphere is too strong, it'll scare away the ghost. How about this, I don't mind if we sleep in the same room. But I mind. You… you have no idea how many people want to sleep with me. But. I don’t just sleep with anyone. Really? If it wasn't for Ms. Shen's high pay, I wouldn't condescend myself to sleep with you. Fine, just for one night. There's only one blanket, keep your hands to yourself. No rolling or stealing the blanket. No gaurantee. You leave tomorrow. Or I'll call the police, I'm serious. Why aren't you more considerate for your aunt? You're so cold. I won't let her be tricked by you. Forget it. Let’s go to bed. Ah, Shen Huai, remember to wake me up at night. You're still awake, why don't you answer? If you know I'm awake, why do you ask? You're so hard to talk to. Then don't talk to me. Are you awake? Come on, let’s enjoy. We have all the time we need. Come on, let’s enjoy. We have all the time we need. We have all the time we need. Sorry. I should have knocked. Please continue. Can’t you be quiet? If you can, blink. Shen Huai, do you believe in ghosts? Do you know that you're very annoying? How can you be so chatty? Normally you don't have people to talk to? Yes, that's exactly right. You like to talk? Then talk to your parents, don't talk to me. I'm an orphan, I don’t know where they are. I have no idea where I'm from, or how old I am. I've been like this since I remember. Every night, only ghosts talk to me. No one else. Forget it. You don't believe what I say anyway, go to bed. Shit, what if that pighead falls asleep? That can't do. We need to watch out tonight. I should wake him up. You're still at it? Sorry for interrupting. Listen, there's a long explanation. I know, I know. I know the reason. You don’t know, let me finish. No need. I want to sleep. I need some time to think, good night. Can't believe you're afraid of ghosts, gosh. Then how could you drive away evil spirits? I think you hugged me first. Be quiet, go take a look. You first, I'll follow. Go. You first. You first. You first. What are you doing? Go see what that is. What’s this? Are frauds so retarded now adays? It no ordinary doll. We heard laughter coming from this room. I only heard you two screaming like pigs. Then where did this doll come from? I put it at the doorway. It said that it wanted to stay at the doorway. Now you know. Go back to bed. Leave first thing in the morning. Wow, you're so efficient. Mr. Jing, found anything last night? Yes. That doll is indeed quite weird. Ms. Shen, you're very sharp. I took care of the doll last night. So you don’t have to worry about it anymore. Took care of it? I found it first. We took care of it together. We took care of it together. The doll's now in this pocket, as along as we supress it, -it will no longer disturb you. -Yes. It’s all right now. Thank you. I don’t know how to thank you two. How about I treat you guys to dinner to thank you. Ok, then let us know the details. See you later then. Ms. Shen, I wasn't done talking. Why didn’t you let me finish? If you say any more, we'll be in trouble. -You wanted to talk about the pay? -Yes. With Shen Huai there, we're lucky he didn't call the cops. Can't believe you want to talk about money. Such a fool. Haven’t you heard what Ms. Shen said? She said she'd treat us to dinner. We'll talk about it later, don't worry. True. You're pretty smart. Of course. Do you have a girlfriend? No. Why do you ask? That’s good. Because from now on, I'll start asking you out. Give me a break. No way. Unless you like men. Otherwise, no way. I know I'm very handsome. But it doesn't mean I need to be with men. Don't see me like that. I see you like that, because I've seen what you do. That was for a reason. OK, I don’t want to hear your explanation. Anyway, I'm sorry. What about dinner? On me. I won't argue with you. By the way, did you hear the laugher last night? Stop it. I have goose bumps. Shen Huai and that boy didn't hear it. I was scared to death. That doll is really creepy. Then what should we do with the doll? Destroy it. I don’t want to take it with me. No. We should keep it first in case of any changes, right? Let’s add each other’s WeChat account. Maybe we can do business together in the future. Uh. Why are you hesitating? The last time we met we didn’t add each other. We need to this time. Come on, I'll scan yours. Ok. Ok. Life without work is nice. Who is it? Shen Huai. Oh, it’s you. Why are you calling me? Where are you? None of your business. I don't have time to argue with you. Where are you? What’s wrong? I'm in the pub. What’s wrong? I'll come to you. Shit. Who do you think you are? I think I'll fall for the same trick? Handsome, can I buy you a drink? It's clean, right? My name is Nicolas Joes. Can we be friends? Nicolas Zhaosi. Your name is really cool. Let me show you some magic. You're romantic. This is for you. Hey, Shen Huai, you have issues. Give me back the doll. No. This is a gift from that foreigner. The doll isn't Lele's? If you didn't tell me, the two dolls look alike. Give it back to me. This isn't Lele’s doll. Believe me. That guy, Nicolas Zhaosi gave me the doll. Give me back Lele’s doll. No, it wasn't easy for me to get it. Plus, if anything goes wrong, you still have to come to me. Cut the crap. I've seen enough frauds to know when I see one. I'll let it go with you. I can't change my aunt. She can buy her peace of mind. Don't bluff here. Give me the doll. Don't worry about the rest. Why should I give it to you? Give me a reason. Why should I tell you? Then I won't give it back. You! Lele wants the doll. He says it's the only gift from his father. He wants it back. Should have told me so. I could give it to you, But. You said that you'd return it if I told you why. But that wasn't the only condition. These days, I've been thinking who you are. Suddenly, I remember that you're the author of Spirit Medium Master? You want to blackmail me? What do you want? I went to your book signing. Unfortunately, at the time I didn't have enough money to buy your book. I was hoping you'd give me a few signed copies. How many? A lot of my friends like your book. I'll give it to them as a gift. I think you mean you'll sell it to them. If I knew that this book would be a guide for you frauds, I never would have wrote it. You don’t understand, I won't bother explaining. So, deal? Go. Bring the doll, I don't want to come back. Sure thing. Here's the doll, give me the books. No need to come in. Leave immediately with the book. I'll sit here and wait, I'm exhausted. Take the books and go. See, it's so dark out now. I'm scared. I'll spend the night here. Leave before I kick you out. We're old acquaintances. Don't be so rude. We're not acquaintances. Go. Please, I beg out. It's too late, there are no more buses. I don't have money to take a taxi. Let me stay for the night. Walk back. I'll sleep on this couch. Let me stay here for the night. If anything goes missing, feel free to call the cops. It's nothing too inconvenient. I'll leave as soon as the buses start running. I warn you, don't touch anything. You're only allowed in this area. Anything goes missing, I'll call the cops. Don’t worry. Last time, because of that idiot Cai Shanshan I didn't get to see your chest. I was worried about how to get close to you. Now, you're within my reach. God is helping me. Shen Huai. One more thing. If you disturb me, leave right away. No. I wanted to ask if you have change of clothes. I'm very delicate. I can't sleep without taking a bath. No, wear your own clothes. No way. How can I wear the same clothes after bathing? Then I'd get dirty again. Jing Ran, you're just annoying me here. No, I'm discussing something serious with you. Look, if you fulfill my wishes, I'm very easy-going. So I suggest you to listen to my suggestions. Then I won't be a bother anymore. You're crazy. I haven't succeeded. Shen Huai. What now? -Do you have any PJs? -No. That won't do. I either wear PJs, or I sleep in the bed. I need to choose one. Or my sleeping quality would be bad. You've gone too far. Are you mad? Wait here. Take it and leave. Have you showered? Yes, what do you want? Our figure are alike. Can you try these on for me? I haven't showered. I can't change once I put them on. Jing Ran. What do you want? Take it or leave. I won't say it again. You're such a rascal. Finding excuses not to go. Bothering me non-stop. Is he gay? I can make good use of that and trick him. Sorry about that. I was a little emotional becaues I was stuck with my novel. It’s ok. It's nothing. I won’t hold it against you. I wanted to ask if you have a girlfriend. That's a little personal. No, you can introduce one. You're quite handsome. Why don’t you have a girlfriend? None of your business. Or maybe you have a boyfriend. What are you talking about? Let me tell you, he thinks I'm gay. Maybe he's gay? He looks like he wears makeup. Maybe he is. What should I do? Should I sacrifice myself? Fine, to make omelette you need to break eggs. Let me be a martyr. Actually, I've always admired you. I've read your book. Last time at Ms. Shen's, I recognized you. But I was worried you don't like me. So I didn't have the courage to tell you. Today, you took the initiative to come. I'm very happy. So I took the opportunity to come here. Are you disgusted by me? No. I understand. Emotions are uncontrollable. How much do you like me? I like you very much. I can't really say how much. Show me then. Um… hold on. I'm not ready. Let's take it slow. How? Take off your shirt first. OK. Raise your hands. Close your eyes. I like how you don’t resist. Very warm on the inside, I see. I bet he likes SM. Hey, what are you doing? What do you mean? What's your purpose for coming here? What else? I'm a fan of your books. No you're not. At first I thought you were gay. But your acting is too bad. My affection for you is now insulted. But it doesn't matter, I love you. If you don't tell me. I won't untie you. I'll take you to the police station tomorrow. I'm just kidding. Untie me. It's quite painful. Auntie. What's wrong? I'll come over right now. Ah, Where are you going? I'm still tied up. Ah, bro. Don't go. Jing Ran, something's wrong. I'm in trouble now. You went over? Where should I go? Shen Huai that idiot tied me up. Wow, so exciting. Ah, no. Gao Le is missing. Oh no. That doll was right now. Has the evil spirit inside came out? What shall we do? What shall we do? Save me first. Wow. You're amazing. How did you get in? You won't believe me. Shen Huai didn't close the door properly. I pulled, and the door opened. Ah, shit. Stop wasting time, untie me. Life-and-death situation, we go together. Hurry up. Hurry up, let’s go. Is it you? Where have you taken Lele? Shen Huai, calm down. Jing Ran and I just found out. Taking away Lele wouldn't do him any good. Shen Huai, Cai Shanshan's right. Please calm down. We have no reason to do this. How can I calm down? If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't allow you two frauds to come here and mess around. At this point you can only trust us again. Yes. Stop complaining. Let him go first. Let's see what happened. Ms. Shen, please tell us what happened. After you two came to our place, everything went back to normal. But after I came home from work today, it doesn't feel at ease at home. Then, I found that Lele was missing. Apart from the uncomfortable feeling, anything else abnormal? Yes, I heard horrible laughers. It coincides with what we guessed previously. The doll is more creepy than we thought. Where is that doll now? At Shen Huai’s home. Let’s go over now. I'll go with you. No need, we'll go alone. You stay here with Ms. Shen. No, I'm worried. I'll go with you. Fine. We don't have a lot of time. If you go, don’t cause any trouble. Auntie, don’t worry. Lele will be fine. Be optimistic. I'll definitely bring him back. Let’s go. It escaped when we weren't prepared. It knows if Lele goes missing, we'd be a mess. It'd be the best time for it to escape. Now that it has escaped, it's about to regain its strength, it's the worst now. We need to find Lele immediately. How could we know where it has taken Lele? Maybe we can check the origin of the doll. Are you Shen Huai? There's no time to joke around. Since we have no other method. Shen Huai, do you trust me? I have no reason not to. Do you know anything about that doll? I only know that Lele's dad gave it to him. Not sure about the rest. But my aunt should know. What are you waiting for? Hurry and ask. Let's rush back to Ms. Shen's. Huai, how is it? Any news of Lele? Auntie, don't worry. We're progressing. There are just a few questions. We will find Lele soon, don't worry. Ok, what is it? Ms. Shen, do you know where the doll came from? I think. Lele’s dad took him to the park last year, and bought it for him at a doll stand. Oh, here's one clue. Park. OK, let’s go to the park immediately. Ms. Shen, don’t worry. Please help me. OK. I want to go to find Lele as well. Ms. Shen, some things are better left to the professionals. You should calm down first. Okay, I'll wait for your updates. OK. Shen Huai, you go first. Cai Shanshan, go back to prepare some tools. We might have a head-on conflict with that thing. Let’s meet at the park entrance. Go. This park is very gloomy. Obviously this is their main field. The three of us must not separate. Otherwise, they might attack us one by one. It is such a horrible place. Who dares to wander alone? Even if you two were blind, I wouldn't walk alone. Stop talking. There's no time. Have you brought the tools I said? What’s this? This is the Soul Lock Umbrella. I got it from Master Lin Dabiao with 500 yuan. Lin Dabiao's a liar. You're insulting him. What else did you bring? What’s this? Rotten eggs. Level-1 defense. You can throw them directly at the bad guys. I guarantee he'll run away after smelling them. Gosh, none of these are useful. We're facing evil spirits. You get it? Gods tell us. Hard work means succeess. If not, you die. Hey, wait for me. I can feel it. The evil spirits must be here. We were right. The grief here is really heavy. Hurry up. Wait. I want to go to the toilet. Are you ok? It's very critical now. I'm nervous. Can’t you hold it for a while? You have to ask my bladder. Personally, I agree. Pee here. Otherwise, we might get separated. No, I'm a girl. Don’t worry. I'll be fast, I won't be far way. I promise that I won't cause any delay. You're already causing delay. Hurry up. Lazy donkey. Hey Shen Huai. Stay here later, don’t go anywhere. You can't handle this kind of danger. Don’t worry, I won't cause any trouble. That was not what I meant. I'm worried about your safety. Oh no, Cai Shanshan. Bastard, if I knew, I should have let her pee her pants. It’s Lele. Shen Huai, he isn't Lele. Let's run. Damn, we're back in the same spot. What should I do, Shen Huai? I'm scared. Don’t be scared. Don't you know any spells? They never work. Where did you learn them? Last year, I learned from your book, Spirit Medium Master. Cai Shanshan's missing too. We can't get separated. Let’s run back. Why are you here? Who is he? He's the one who gave me the doll. We meet again. Your boyfriend's here as well. Who are you? Did you take away Lele? Yes, he said he was lonely, so I took him here to play with the kids. So you've killed many children. What the hell do you want? You're Jing Ran, right? You're an orphan. You call me an orphan. I'm one as well. Why don’t you stay with me? No way. Give me back Lele. You can go. But Jing Ran must stay here with me. I won't let you take Jing Ran. Jing Ran, let’s go. Shen Huai. Mr. Jing, what’s wrong? It was a dream. Why was it so real? Please calm down, Mr. Jing. Everything was a dream. It wasn't real. You should calm down first. Mr. Jing, have you calmed down? Doctor, what happened? It’s said that all your stories were based on real cases. Your book Spirit Medium Master Series 1 is called Horrible Doll. You will know what has happened after reading it.

It will keep your house safe. What do you mean? Me, do you want me?
