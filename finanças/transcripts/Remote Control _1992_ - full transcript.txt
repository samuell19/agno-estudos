Flosi, telephone. Flosi, telephone. Take a message! Just a minute. It's your wife. She says don't forget to get some booze. - Alright! Axel! - What? Do you need to go to S.A.T.S.? - Go where? The State Alcohol and Tobacco Store? - Yes. Am I going? - Yes. No. But I can go for you, if you want me to. Flosi. Come to reception. Einar's going to S.A.T.S. He wants to know whether you need anything. - Hold this. And be careful with that contact plate. I have to empty that bucket. - I'll only be a second. Axel, telephone. It's your mother. Take a message! She says you've got the remote control for the TV. She wants it back immediately. And you haven't taken the fish out of the bath tub. - I know. And there's fish in the kitchen sink, too. Hold on. There's something else. Reynir! Hey, Vigfus! What? Can you hold this for me? Just for a minute? - Why? There's a call for me. I'm holding it for Flosi. Oh, I see. - I won't be a second. No. - You won't? Do you think Flosi would do the same for you? - No. Never do for others what you know they'd never do for you. Got it? - Yes. Sorry. There's a call for you in reception. - I know! You haven't made your bed. And there's dirty plates all over... Just a second. I'll deal with the damned fish when I get back tonight. There's no need to adopt that tone of voice with me. I'm not adopting any tone of voice. When am I going to be able take a bath? I'll take them out tonight. I promise. That's what you said yesterday. I'll pull the plug out. - No! And where's the remote control? How should I know where it is? - You should know. The remote control? No idea! - Alright. Then Maja must have it. Where's Maja? - I don't know. I expect she's at Unnur's place. Find her for me. Find Maja? Just to get the remote control? Mum! She should sleep in her own bed at night. She's out partying somewhere. - How would you know? I'll buy you a new remote control. Find Maja and my remote control or I'll take the plug out. I'll get the fish out of the bath when I get back tonight. No, Axel. I'll empty the bath and flush them into the sea. Mum! Maja! Shit! Maja, you're coming home! - Shut up, shithead! You shut up! And don't adopt that tone of voice. You're coming back for dinner. - Piss off! You should sleep in your own bed, like other people. Look, Axel, I'll do what I want. Shit! Then give me the remote control for the TV. The remote control for the TV? What are you talking about? Mum says you've taken it. - You're both crazy. Look, I have to find it or Mum's going to empty the bath. You shouldn't have put those damned goldfish in the bath. Are you talking about the remote control from your place? - Yes. It's at Unnur's place. - What's it doing there? I forgot to take it with me. - Did you steal it from us? No. I mean, yes, actually. Give us a ride there, Axel. I never do anything for nobody who don't do nothing for no one. What? - It's a saying. Let's get moving. - Because of this remote control unit? That's right. - Jesus Christ! Now the whole thing's covered in soup! What was I supposed to do? Unnur! Where are you? Hello. Excuse me, do you live here? Leave me alone! - Maja! What did you do to her, you bloody fool? I hardly touched her! She already had that cut. Axel, get Orri off the sofa. Did you push him? - He fell! You stupid bastard... - Oh shut up! Look, they've cut right through my life-line. It's alright. What does that mean? That's serious, isn't it? I'm sure it's fine. No problem. Really. Hey, Maja. Is this Mum's remote control? I don't know. - Well, that's that. Goodbye Maja. Or perhaps, you're coming home with me? No. Nice to have met you. Brilliant. Fuck off. Bye. It's your fault if Mum pulls the plug out! Got it? Can I use the phone? - Yes. I hate him. Who is he? - My brother, Axel. He's a total dick-head. Terminal case. Mum! - Where are you? Did you find Maja? I've found her alright. I'm on Safamyri, number... I can't see what number it is. The phone number is 38243. You can call directory for the address. Did you tell Maja to come home? - Yes. I've found the remote control... - What's she been up to? I don't know! I've found the remote control. But it's melted. - Melted? Yeah. Someone set fire to a chair. There's been quite a party here. The place is a mess. Glasses and fag ends all over the place. And the remote control was on this chair, and it melted. The chair was on fire? Axel, where are you? At Unnur's. Maja's friend. Either you bring that remote control back here or those fish go down the drain. - Don't you believe me? No, I don't. Let me speak to Maja. Why should I lie? This bloke with Maja stole the remote control unit. He's a thief. This stuff's completely destroying our brain cells. Yeah. Look at him. He's totally out of it. That's obvious. - Your brother is going to have to fix this. Aggi closed Sodoma down at midnight. Come on, Maja. - What? Mum wants to talk to you. - Did you call Mum? Come on, she's waiting for you. I'll talk to Mum when I feel like it. You better not... Wow! Shit! Is he dead? - Don't be stupid! R 18856. - It was a Lada. It was a Dodge. R 18856. Anyone got a pen? Bloody hell. That's some rock. - Has anyone got a pen? Hey, wow! What's this? Give me that piece of paper. I need to write down the number No way. This is evidence. R 15568. Isn't that what I said? - R 155... R 15586. - No, that wasn't it. "Now we're angry." "Soon, we are going to be really pissed off. Go to Moli." This is for you, Unnur. I can't go and see Moli. - Why not? I'm too tired. Besides, I need to clear up here. We can clear the place up. People don't do anything unless you do something for them too. What? That's what they say. Alright then. I'll go. Who's got a car? No one got a car? I'm not taking a bus. Moli lives miles away. - He's got a car. I'm not going with him. - He's got a great motor. Sorry, I'm still not going anywhere with him. Hey, he's waking up. Be nice to him. Hey, Axel. Weren't you going on about the remote control? Give Unnur a lift. Her brother can fix you up with a new one. Give Unnur a ride? - You don't do nothing for no one unless you do something. - What? Do you want that remote control or not? - Yes. Then give Unnur a ride. Her brother can get one for you. Got it? - Yes. Turn to the right here. Do you mean left? - Yes. I meant that way. Why don't you just tell me the name of the street? Then you don't have to keep saying "left" or "right." I can't tell anyone where Moli lives. Anyway, I don't know the name of the street. Do you know where it is? - Of course I do! How could I tell you directions if I didn't? I don't know. God bless you. What's God got to do with it? Idiot! Turn right here. - Left. See that shop over there? Fifty kroners worth of jelly babies, please. This place is always full of junk. Disgusting. None of my friends have ever seen my brother Moli before. You're the first. - Wow. Big deal. Who's there? - Unnur. Moli. Two Sony?s, sure. But there'll be a short wait. About ten days. What? No, what makes you think that? I'm sorry... Yes, like I said, about ten days. Two weeks at the most. Yeah, sure. It's up to you. He needs a remote control unit. Samsung. - Talk to Arni. Don't bring any kids round here. - It's no problem. He's a total wally. You're going to have to do something about this bootleg. Remote control, you say? - Yes. Have you all gone mad? - What do you mean? Are you trying to kill someone? - Kill someone? Why is it so green? - Leave it alone. It's putting people to sleep. - To sleep? Takes about twenty minutes. That's because there's no Etrine in it. So you knew about this. You bastard. I've been trying to tell you for ages that we need Etrine. Etrine? Illegal substance. Impossible to get hold of it. I've mentioned it a number of times. Where have we been getting it so far? - Spur. From Spur. - Spur Cola. They've stopped making it because it contains Etrine. This is absurd. Spur? Why can't you use Pepsi or Coke instead? Come on! Pepsi or Coke! What's wrong with Pepsi or Coke? - Vomiting, diarrhea, headache, hiccups. We tried it on Hoddi. We preferred to have him sleeping. Don't you know what happened at Sodoma yesterday? - What? That lousy bootleg of yours sent everyone to sleep. Aggi had to close down at midnight. - Aggi? Yes. He'll send his mafia boys over here! Damn! Spur Cola. Does anyone remember Spur? Does anyone know how to get hold of any? The kind that used to be in those bottles with a net pattern? - Yeah, with a red and white label. Tasted a bit like soapy water. - Anyone remember Miranda? Miranda, yes. And Jolly Cola. Look, we're talking about Spur here. Do you know where we can get some? I might have a bottle of it at home somewhere. I used to collect that kind of stuff once. But I haven't got any on me. Shit! Aggi, Elli and Brjansi. Shut up, you idiot. They followed you. Now they know where I am. Followed us? - Yes. They came in here. I saw them. - Oh yeah? Well, I don't remember. It's been really busy today. Busy eh? We've been waiting outside here. I haven't seen a single customer walk in here. I don't think anyone's come in here. How do you explain that car outside? - Shut up Brjansi! What's that car doing outside? We'll kill you if you don't talk! - Put the blade away. They're in the storeroom. We'll wait. Why did they follow us? - Well, they knew that... Turn the lights on. We've got to get rid of them. What do you want for this bottle? Arni, ring them downstairs. Well, just that remote control unit over there. Go with him and let him have this when you get the Spur. No, Moli. No way! Are you going to buy something or are you just hanging about? I'd like a coke, a jumbo sandwich and some liquor ice. You do hamburgers? - Yes. Jumbo? - Yes. Microwave? - Yes. Then I'll have a hamburger and a coke. Get me some Victory V's. - And some Victorys V's. Do you collect Spur bottles? - No. I used to collect all kinds of stuff when I was a kid. I used to collect bible pictures. You mean the kind you get in Sunday School? - Yes. I used to steal them from Dad's drawer. He's a vicar. I stopped when I got up to 130,000. Have you stopped collecting? - Yes. All I've got now is a few goldfish. Can I make a call? Axel? Have you found my remote control? Hafnar Fjord? Yes, we had to come and see Unnur's brother. To get a new remote control unit. Mum, I can't get away. The bouncers won't let me out. No, I'm not out drinking! You know I never do that. What? No! What? O.K. Yes. Alright. Will do. Bye. Is your mum angry? She reckons I took the remote control unit. Know what? I'm learning how to raise and lower the volume and change channels just by telepathy. I don't believe you. - It's absolutely true. You're having me on. - No, I swear it. I can teach your mum. - Teach her? Yes. - She'd never go for it. Come on. Call her. I'll talk to her. Well, you'll have to do the talking. - Right. I'm busy. - I'm thirsty. Unnur says she can teach you how to change channels... It just makes you sleep. - I don't care. Don't let him tread on the... Get her! Let go of me! Let go! Elli, come on. Leave them alone. Moli! Moli! Moli? Where's Moli? Who, him? Let's move it. Move! For Christ's sake. - Hold on. Come on. Hurry up! She's scratches! Was that Moli, back there? - Answer, you fucking bitch! Aggi! - Let me go! Shut your mouth and keep your eyes on the road. I'm not getting involved in kidnapping. It's not kidnapping. It's just Unnur, Moli's sister. He's right. This is kidnapping. You're abducting me. - No. You like it. Right. I said right! You say "right" and point left. - So what? You don't know right from left. You drive yourself. I haven't got a license. - Oh, sorry. Put the blade away, Brjansi. - You're going to die. Moli really likes you guys. He's talking about setting up a mafia ring with you. Mafia? With us? Yes, he says you're the most experienced gang in town. Straight ahead. You understand that don't you? Aggi, why are you kidnapping the girl? We're no pimps! Let's turn Sodoma into a brothel. - I'm into that. Get your hands off! - Leave the poor girl alone. You're exactly the right types to run a brothel. See, she's into it. - Are you? Sure. I can get some girls for you. Guys too. - Guys? What do you take us for? Perverts? Look, there they are! Faster. They're losing us. Do you reckon I can get that remote control tomorrow? What remote control? - The one you gave Unnur. Is that all you can think about? My mum will kill me if I don't get it for her. Hey, Axel. That remote control I gave to Unnur is the last Samsung I've got in stock. - The last Samsung? Can you get together a few of your girlfriends then? Sure. How many do you need? - Ten. No, about five. - Five? O.K. I know one black girl. Sounds good. - Alright by me, too. Very good move. - I know a yellow girl too. Good to have a bit of variety. - O.K. By me. And one Greenlandic girl. She's green of course. And then there's one orange girl and a purple one. How many is that? - Are you taking the piss? You stupid bitch! - Take it easy. What's the matter with you? I'm not going to kill her! Are you completely nuts! What are you doing? Keep going. - I'm not going through a red light. We'll lose them. They nearly caused a very serious accident. - So what? Come on, step on it! - No way! They're out of sight. - The lights are turning green. Look at this, guys. - Was that in your glass? Wonder where they got it from? Disgusting. Probably some laboratory. - A public rubbish dump? Yeah, or a chemical plant. Orri! I've got some news. Moli's got a price on his head. Aggi's offering a reward for him. - You're lying. Anna over there at the bar just told me all about it. What's the reward? A plane ticket to the Costa del Sol. For one. I'd like to go to the Costa del Sol. - Me too. Not me. Awful place. You're really pathetic! Chasing kidnappers and you stop at a red light. Like an old lady! Well, the law's the law. Of course, they'll be at Sodoma tonight. They're bouncers at Sodoma. They own the place. What's Sodoma? - What's Sodoma? He doesn't know what Sodoma is. Come on, how am I supposed to know what Sodoma is? It's a night club. - Fine, let's move. O.K. Let's go. - Right then, let's go. Where is it? - I don't know where it is. He doesn't know where Sodoma is. I don't go to night clubs anymore. Ask her. Maybe she knows. - She won't know. Alright, then we'll go down town and find it. Get that dog away from here! Lousy that stuff you had here yesterday. - Top grade tonight. What do you mean "lousy stuff", you shithead? Up against the wall! Hey lads! They're coming. They're shitting their pants! I mean their skirts. Look at those outfits. They think we're Asterix and Obelix. Let them get a bit closer. Let them see that sword. Show them, we're armed. Who's that in the passenger seat? Elli, spit on the ground. O.K. I'll count to three and we'll go for them. One, two, three! What are they doing to my car? Damn! - How were we supposed to get hold of them? They were laughing at us. We had to do something. They got away. - Just shut the hell up. We've still got the girl, at least. Damn! Hell! Aren't you coming too? I'll go in through the front. They don't know me. Reckon you'll get past them in that sweater? Give me the keys to the car. I'll find something there. But there isn't anything in the car. I'll work something out. You go inside. Aggi, what the hell are we doing with that girl? How about putting her in a porno movie? Not a bad idea. The first Icelandic porno movie. I can act. I did some acting at school. I don't think it needs much acting ability. But I want a part in it. - We can all be in it. Who's going to hold the camera then? We can do three short movies. Then we can all have a go. My movie's going be called "Lovesweat." "Love Duet," that's what I'll call mine. What are you going to call yours, Elli? - I don't know "Fat love." How about that? - Shut up. "Fat man gets it off." - Shut up! "Fat man can't find his dick because he's much too fat." Will you leave me alone. That wasn't a bad idea the girl had. We could set up our own mafia. We are the best and the most experienced gang in Iceland. Set up a mafia. What for? - Don't you get, you fat lump? Prostitution, porno movies, sexual aids, bootleg, drugs, i.e., heroin, coke, hash, acid... No drugs! You don't have to take any yourself. - Acid-brains! Now that was uncalled for. He's got shit for brains anyway. Poor bastard. Axel! - Maja. What are you doing here? I'm looking for that damned remote control for you! What, here in the toilet? - All over town. WANTED. MOLI. REWARD. TRIP TO COSTA DEL SOL. What are you going to do with him if you find him? Teach him a lesson. You've got to call Mum. She'll never believe me. No, I will not call Mum. - I'll call then. You just tell her I'm not lying. You think he's got the bootleg there? - He was there himself. What are you going to do? - Send the police round there. I mean, he must have all his gear there on the premises. Serves him right. - Got a phone here? In the cloakroom. Need some small change? - Yes. Thanks. What does "Ml" mean? - "Ml"? "MI." Mafia, Iceland. What did you say? Unnur's in what racket? I said she's got it in her POCKET. Yes. Hold on. Aggi's sending the law round to my place. That was my Mum on the phone! - Have you found Unnur? That's one of my seat covers! - There was nothing else. You want that remote control unit, right? - Yes. You'll get it plus a TV if you do me a favor. - What's that? Stash some gear for me. Have you got a garage? - Yes. Go home. I'll have them bring the gear over to you. Right now? - Yes, right now! Axel, shouldn't you ask Mum first? She's going to get a TV and a remote control unit. Get going, man. Axel, where do you live? - What? Where do you live? - Dufnaholar 10. What? - Dufnaholar 10. DUFNAHOLAR 10. Dufnaholar 10. Is that supposed to be you? Idiots! That's a drawing of Axel. Fucking row! I can't hear anything. Let me see. What does it say on that card? Go straight to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect 20. O.K. Hoddi. Go to jail. - No. Hoddi, you have to go to jail. Of course you have to. I'm not going. - This is just a game. I went to jail just before. I didn't like it very much. I'm not going to jail. Hoddi, everyone goes to jail. Come on now. Hoddi, you're not going to start crying, are you? Put him in jail. No nonsense. Hey, Dufnaholar 10. - Yes? It's an apartment building, isn't it? - Dufnaholar 10? Yes. I thought so. What floor? - Top floor. Why? Just checking. Best to be sure about these things. Telephone. - Thanks. Who the hell is that? - Calm down. He's only making a phone call. - Why the hell? He can make a call if he wants. It's Moli, Unnur's brother. Are you Moli? - Yes. What the hell's gotten into you? - Take it easy, man. We're in the middle of a gig! - There's no need to hit me. Get the hell out of here! - Why did you leave the stage? I've got hold of him. This is Moli. - Moli? Orri! - Costa del Sol. Costa del fucking Sol. - This guy's got a beard. Well, you must have shaved it off. What's going on in here? - Hey Aggi, this is Moli. Where? - That guy there. We caught him. This guy? Aggi from Alftamyri! Do I know you? - Aggapon's Secret Society. Joey, is that you? It's Joey! - Joey? Maja, it's not Moli. - Of course it's not Moli. Get back on stage or you'll never play here again. Come on Orri. - I understand. That's not Moli. You bloody bitch! I can put two and two together. - Piss off. Fuck you. It's not as if we meet everyday. How long has it been? - Ten, fifteen years. At least ten! - We had our own mafia when we were kids. Aggapon's Secret Society. Like Al Capone. Hey! You haven't forgotten, have you? It was like this, wasn't it? Something like that, anyway. Joey! Aggi, baby. I saw this guy just now. In here? Bullshit. He'd never be able to get in here. I talked to him. He's having a party at Dufnaholar 10. Absolute bullshit. Piss off. He can't fool me. Moli lives in Hafnar Fjord. Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Hey, that reminds me. I've got to call the police. You mean you haven't yet...? Found him? - No. What are you going to do with Moli? - What did you say? What are you going to do with Moli? Like this! - I don't know. Have you got any cement? - What? No. It could be done. - That would be really neat. Have you got a basin? - No. I can fix this for you. - Really? You got a phone? - Phone? You name it. I've got it. Why is it so cloudy? The bloody booklet's in German or something. Do you know what to "sturmass strumme" means? - No. Don't you speak German? - No. Unfortunately. Telephone. Have a seat, darling. - Thanks. Hafnar Fjord Police Station. 51166. - One more try. I'll wait till you're through. Cigar? Unnur? Hang on. I'll be right down. Sorry. I'm dying to go to the loo. Damn! What the hell's gotten into Elli? - What do you mean? He just ran downstairs like a lunatic. Is something wrong? Just a minute. He's gone into the boiler room... The boiler room? Maybe he's gone to check the air conditioning. - But why? There must be something wrong. There's smoke everywhere. Shit! Go and help him. You know where it is? Don't forget to lock the front door. Brjansi! Brjansi! Hell! I need a portable phone. Portable phone. You don't have enough cash. - Hello? Hello, Joey here. - Moli, where are you? Something wrong with your ears? Joey, I said. What's up? Getting bored being called Moli? - Is Arni there? Aren't you coming home? - Put Arni on the line. Been drinking, have you? - No. Let me talk to Arni. What the hell? Alright then. Arni. Telephone. What are you doing? - No more loans. Moli? - Listen, it's Joey here. I need a bag of cement. A bag of cement? - Yes, and the large steel basin. It's in the shed behind the house. - Shed behind the house? Find them and meet me round the back of Sodoma. - Sodoma? And clear up the apartment. - Clear up? Clear up all the gear there. Take it with you to Dufnaholar 10. - Dufnaholar 10. I'm not joking. - Not joking. Aggi, do you need any distilling gear? No. Hafnar Fjord Police Station.51166. Moli's going to have some visitors. Hello? Is that the Police Station in Hafnar Fjord? Rehearsing for the porno film in here? I'm not going to be in any porno film. - Just as well. You're so fat you'd suffocate the girl. - Shut your face. I've never been with a girl before. Shut up! They think I'm so fat and ugly. Shut up! Oh, why are you going blue? Am I suffocating you? Doesn't matter. I'm coming! I'm coming! I've had about as much as I can take from you. Acid-brains! I'm going to string you up! - Elli! Don't Elli! I'll do anything for you. Watch my glasses! There she is! Grab my hand. Brjansi, come and help me. Brjansi! Talk to me. Yes, what is it? You're alright, aren't you Brjansi? Am I alright? I think they've got some kind of distillery going there. Yes, I know. Quite a gang, yes. I reckon they're selling hash, too. Through the window. Unnur! - Over here! I'm peeing. Get the car started. I can't find the keys. - What? Damn! I gave them to Moli. Come on. Moli's car. Wasn't that Orri in the back seat? Orri, that long-haired broomstick? I thought I saw him in the back of that cab. I thought I saw Maja and Moli come out of a fridge. Out of a fridge? This remote control business is driving me nuts. I thought I saw Maja holding it before. Hey, have you still got that remote control unit? What remote control unit? - The one Moli gave you today? You mean this? - Yes. I can turn the volume up or down telepathically. Hey, wasn't that Rolli and Tobbi in that cab? Where's everyone going? Listen. What if we need to use the bed? You mean she'll wake up? Turn that down! I'm trying to organize some booze here. Don't we have to take her out downstairs? Excuse me. Good evening. We've got some gear for Moli. Know anything about it? Moli? Unnur's brother? - Yes. Top floor. It's probably for Maja. There's no doubt about it. - Confirmation photo? No doubt at all! - Any booze there? No, but some guys are bringing in some video gear. Yes, hello? - Arni? Hold on a second. Chat with him. - Chat with him? If he turns up, hold him until I get there. - Hold on a minute. Yes, who is it? - It's Joey. I was just thinking. Don't you need some brewing gear? What's the deal? - I've got a guy on the phone who's selling. Not now. I'm on my way out. - It's the guy with the cement. Where are you going? - The guy with the cement? Hold on. Where is this place? - It's in Breidholt somewhere. Hey. What's the address here? - Dufnaholar 10. Dufnaholar 10! Did you say something? - No. Wait a minute. I'm off to Breidholt. - That's exactly where this guy is. Can you meet him halfway? - Sure. How about the South Road? - Fine, yes. Can you meet someone on the way back? - Sure. Who? I'll be there in half an hour. Keep him there. - Half an hour? A guy in a green Dodge with red spots on it. Green Dodge with red spots. Christ, she's heavy! - No she's not. She won't get much peace here. - I guess not. Grab hold of the front. Probably a very nice woman. Don't you get it? Are you completely brainless? Get that fucking basin in the fucking car! What are you going to do with that basin, Aggi? Do we all have to go? - What do you mean? I need to get changed and have a bath. Do you think I am comfortable like this? - No. Are we running this outfit together or not? - Yes. Shut up then. - Bloody hell. What did you say? Are you talking to me? - No, to Elli. Shut up, Elli. Look! That's beautiful. Hey, that's directly above my place. Do you live over there? - In that block there. There's Moli. Run him over. - No way. Run him over, Elli! Run him over! How long does it take for cement to dry? How long does cement take to dry? - I don't know. What are you doing? - How long does it take to dry? Cement? I don't know. An hour maybe. - Shit! Tape her up! Hurry up! Hey, hey. Wait a minute! Anything coming out? - No. And now? - Yes, a bit. Are you going to drown him? What do you think? What about the girl? You take care of her. Take care of him too. - Are you crazy? Am I supposed to do all the killing? What about Elli? We don't have to kill Elli. No, I mean, can't he do some of the killing? Put your feet back in the basin. - What? I said, put your feet back in the basin. Put my feet back in the basin? - Yes! Elli. The angler! - I'm not killing anybody. What? - Don't we have to knock off those kids too? Elli, keep your eyes on Moli. Let me go! Put me down! - Bring her over here. Elli, go and get the angler. - I'm not killing anyone. Just go and get him! - Get him? Move yourself. Hello there. - Yes? There's a man over here. He wants to talk to you. Talk to me? - Yes. Just over here. I really don't have the time. What are you doing down there? Just messing about. Won't you come and have a word with him? Oh, alright. - Good. Anything happening? - No. This guy here. You wanted to talk to me? - No. Elli. Grab hold of him. - Grab hold of him? Yes! What are you up to here? - Grab hold of him. Shit! - Elli! I need to go and change my clothes. And now? - No. Damn! Yes, it's coming out now! Mum? Help! Are you going to let me drown? Was there someone in that boat? - Yes, an old lady. Looks like the dam gave way. - Yeah, it must have. Should we take a look? - Are you crazy? The cops are there. Yes, I know. - Aggi will kill us for this. We'll have to leave the country. - And go where? Can you speak English? Or Danish? - No. Aggi will tear us apart. I've got an aunt who lives in Akranes. Blow into this for me. That'll do. What? I only asked for one remote control unit. I'll move this stuff into my room. - Sit down here. I told you to put this into the garage. Then we'll turn on the TV. We had no key. - On the key ring, fool. Typical. Maja. Will you take a look in there. What are you doing Unnur? - She's using telepathy. I'm turning up the volume with telepathy. You did it! - It's amazing. How do you do it? - I just think... I just think "raise the volume" and concentrate. Why don't you try to turn the color off? I don't know whether I can turn the color off. - Try. She falls for it every time. - Where did you get that? Aggi gave it to me. - Aggi gave it to you? You're really good at this. - It's very tiring. Here's your remote control unit. - Thank you, dear. Don't you want me to teach you telepathy too? - No thanks. Aren't you cold? - Yes, maybe. You have to be careful. You might catch hypodermia.
