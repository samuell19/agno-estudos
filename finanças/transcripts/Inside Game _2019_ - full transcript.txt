You stick together, you're a team. Teamwork will beat any other individual player. - We grew up on 100 basketball courts. Our father's taught a team game. Five on five, unselfish play. Fundamentals, teamwork, trust. We set screens, we got guys open. We threw the extra pass and if our teammate got beat we came over from the weak side to help. - Yes! - We bled for each other. We lied for each other. We tested loyalty every day. We never lost. - Hey, hey, hey, come on Tommy. - You guys gotta get outta here. Go, go, go, go, I'm all right. - You sure? - Go!

Come on. We divorced 10 months later, but not because my wife found out I had bathroom sex at my bachelor party. The thing about my friends is, we could always keep a secret. Hell yes we would lie to a cop. - Don't forget Mary needshelp with her algebra homework. - Oh my God, that's totally nottrue. - She got a B on her math test. - What's wrong with a B? - Nothin', if you're a born loser. - Mr. Kincate said nobody uses algebra after high school anyway. - Wait, who said that? - He's my volleyball coach. - Jesus Christ, Baba. You think they talk that kinda shit in private school? - We gotta talk. - Seriously Pete? We're havin' lunch. - Good to see ya Deb, how you doin'? - Great, thank you. - You know what nobody uses after high school Mary? Volleyball, all right? Let's work on that algebra later. - Take any action from Jack Kincannon lately? - I wish. Guy's a fuckin' cash cow. - Not lately. - Oh. Yes, Sir? To win 50, Detroit minus four. All right. We sayin' Kincannon got sharp? - Guy used to fork over two grand a week in college football. He just took me for 15 grand inthe NBA. - Well, anybody can get lucky once Pete. - For the third week in a row. - Major line move, major line move, major line move. - Look. These are his last 13 games. - It's like 75% accurate. - Yeah. The guy's suddenly an NBA betting savant when we both know he don't know shit about pro hoops. However, he does know your old pal Tim Donaghy, who by the way officiated all but two of these games. Whatever Donaghy's up to, why is he telling Kincannon andnot you? And what can we do to change that? - So, I just applied at The Hoffman School . No, I'm serious like, we did. - Uh, I just heard Megan tell someone we applied to The Hoffman School? - Oh yeah, we did. - Well, all right. That's good to know because uh, Hoffman's what, $45,000 a year? - Honey, it's the best school in the state. - Well, I thought uh, Millican was? - Millican's the best public school. - Um, babe, we spent an extra $200,000 on this house so we could specifically be at Millican, yeah? - Honey, she's gifted. I don't know what to tell ya. - Uh, by what standard? - You're kidding, right? - No look, she is uh, she's smart and talented just like her mother but we can't be at Hoffman on my salary and still keep this house. - And keep your golf membership. - Millican is a great school. I know that because you told meso. - You're a shit you know that? - Dad! Taxi! - Christ. Hey sweetie. - No, that is not happening. - I gotta go to work now. - Yeah, I know. - Can you put the phone down? - Have a nice trip, Dad. - What, seriously? Hey, happy birthday. I love you. She's all pissed - He's really annoying. - off all over again. - She probably knows you're notgonna let her go to Hoffman. And you know, we didn't get her the one present she asked for. - What, the Juicy bodysuit? - Yeah. Have a good trip. - All right girls, Daddy's gotta go to work. Too tight, Dad. - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Give me a kiss. - Yuck. - We grew up in a pocket of Delaware County called DrexelHill, where they teach basketball to kids the way South Korea teaches math. Bounce passes, back screens, zone D and a half core trap. The area doesn't produce players so much as it produces studentsat a game. So it's not a total surprise one of us grew up to be a ref. - Fucker. - Don't get up on account of me. - All right. - Listen, we'll talk. Tommy and I gotta make a run in to the Big Apple, okay? - How you been, Pete? - Ask me again in two weeks. - All right. - All right, try to relax, okay? Hey, what's goin' on Tim? - Just need an Advil, Doc. Sittin' this one out tonight? - It's a game time decision. - Yeah, we'll see about that. Help yourself, Tim. Go ahead Tim, help yourself. - Basketball and book making. Walk into any sports bar in Delco, any golf club, any grade school Christmas pageant. The only guys not bettin' games are the one takin' the bets, and except for the doctors and lawyers in town, they were the ones makin' a killing. Our boy Baba was top dog. Hey, we're outside the frat house. As far as the IRS knew, Baba was a professional gambler. Good years and bad, he'd report a couple hundred grand in earnings to avoid any red flags. But technically speaking, he wasn't a bookie. He was a mover. What's funny about the Vegas sports books is they hate to gamble. Say you're some square college kid with 500 bucks and a hunch on Know the Hoops. They love you. Place your bet pretty boy. But say you're short and you got500 grand to get down on 10 different games. Forget it. Fuck off. You can't get those bets down anywhere. Movers, guys like Baba, they keep the shark guys in thegame. They'll disguise that 500k and get it down in smaller chunks across 20 different alleys. Big time sports books, small time bookies, offshore everywhere. And for their trouble, they take 1% of the winnings. Baba moved millions for a ruthless numbers freak who called himself The Chinaman, I think as a fuck you to the serotype. Guy wasn't even Chinese. But I meant anyone stupid enough to call him that to his face. - You wanna locked pick? Week 15, Eagles, Giants. Bet the birds. - Says who? - Had a guy in the New York locker room. He says he knows for a fact theGiants are a bunch of total fuckin' pussies. - Fuck you Battista. - Aw, fuck you and your New York football Giants. What do you got here ? - On paper he was a professional gambler, but come on now. - Nice. - Takin' 1% from the best sports handicappers inthe world? How the fuck do you call that gambling? - Yeah. Yeah, to win, two dimes. Indiana, Denver. Like uh, Nuggets plus the points. Yeah. ♪ Crazy Paul ♪ Yo, what up babe ♪ This is what we do - You talk to Donaghy a lot right? - On the phone all the time. - He ever mention Jack Kincannon? - Not since he moved away. They used to play golf all the time. Why? - I need to see him Tommy. - Kincannon? - Donaghy. Next time he's in town. - I thought you two couldn't see each other anymore?

Come on. - I'm not stayin' Baba, no offense. - Yeah, I missed you too buddy. - Hm. I could lose my job for this. - Dunce, relax. All right? We're just a couple of friends havin' drinks. I mean, it's not like I'm your old friend Jack Kincannon,huh? It's not like you're givin' me sharp picks so I can go off and bet 'em with my old friend Pete Ruggieri. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. The fuck Tommy? - Well, is it true? - Is what true? - Of course it's fuckin' true. Tim, come on. It's a drink. - Huh? It's just a drink, dunce. - Tim, it's a drink. Come on, sit next to me. Open it. Come on. - All right, all right. - You look good by the way. How's Kim? - She's fine. - Yeah, and the girls? - They're the same. - Is Kincannon payin' you per winning pick? - Baba, I told you-- - Listen Timmy, we've known each other a long time, right? So why don't we just skip to thepart where I understand how all thisworks? - Fuck! - Good, good. It's all right. Now, let's get to the partwhere I make you a better offer. What's he payin' you per pick? - He's not, he just, he, gets my bets down. - Okay. How much you bettin'? - Two grand a game. - That's it, just two dimes? - It's never just two when you lose the fuckin' thing Baba. - Oh. Hey, there she is. All right, thank you very much. I'll pay you five per winning pick. - What if I lose? - It's a free roll Timmy. I pay your wins and I eat your losses. - Five grand per win guaranteed? - Yes. It's not gambling anymore, right? Think of it as commerce. - I got caught once. - Yeah, you did, by me because I'm the best there is and you went and picked the wrong God damn partner. I mean, what the fuck? You couldn't have come to us first? - Yeah, suddenly you can't trustus? - No, no. I just, I didn't, I didn't wanna put you guys at risk. - Risk? Risk? That's adorable. Risk . Listen, Tim, the three of us, we make this work. We keep it real small, just between us. So we build an airtight system and then we shut the fuck up about it, all right? All right? We bet small and we spread 'em out so we don't draw any attention to ourselves. Tim, Tim, we're not gonna get caught, all right? There's a license to print money. No risk. All we're waitin' on is for you to say yes. - I wanna talk to Tommy. How the fuck did he find out? - I don't know dunce. Maybe it was the degenerate gambling addict you picked for a partner. - Does Baba pay up? 'Cause Kincannon sure as hell doesn't. - Of course Baba pays up. He's the best there is. - Tomorrow. Philly's a four point dog but Boston will cover the spread. - Hey. - Hey coach. - Real fast boys, you gotta seethis. Ta da! You wonder where he got it, huh? - Holy, where'd you find all this? - Oh, easy. I uh, I Googled uh, Tim Donaghy, NBA, Cardinal O'Hara, I got like 10,000 hits. It's practically a dream come true. I'll grab us some beers. - Practically. - Oh come on, you know what he means. - Nobody dreams of bein' a ref Tommy. Nobody studies this game, practices three hours a day all through high school to grow up to officiate, nobody but a dickhead at least. - He's still proud of you, bro. - Yeah. Practically, huh? - My dad ain't proud of me likethis. - Well, he ought to be. You're 10 years older than any other pot dealer I know. - What are we drinkin' to Mr. D? - What else? To basketball. - Basketball. - Check it out guys. Iverson signed this for my kid for his birthday. - Iverson carries the ball every time he crosses over. Don't forget that just 'cause hewrote his friggin' name all right? - Where's your line on Philly, Boston? All right. Uh, give me 20 dimes on Boston minus the points. It's Baba4545. All right, thanks. - Do we have to watch the whole game? - Well, that's why I bought this thing Steph. Pro hoops in high def. - I was hoping we could break it in with some HD porn. - Ah, don't worry. There's plenty of time for that. - So who's playin' anyway? - Boston, Philly, huh? - Yeah. Hey, did Jack Kincannon bet thisone? - Nope. Where we at with Donaghy? - I'm afraid I killed the golden goose, Pete. Scared him off when I told him Iknew. - You told him you knew? - Well, I had to, you know? To ask him to work for us. At first he denied any involvement, then he swore up and down he'd never do it again. You know, somethin' about not wantin' to blow his career. This uh, this type of shit don't stay secret long so... - No, I guess it don't. - Offense is goin' down. - You kiddin' me Donaghy? That's another bullshit call. - What your mind shit heel unless you wanna sit out a couple of games. What do you think, hm? - Fuck you ref! You suck! - Santa Claus is here. Morning sunshine . - What's up? Pleasure doin' business boys. - Whoa what is Tommy's take? - Half of yours? - What the fuck did he do half of? - Dunce, listen. From here on out and for as long as we do this, you and I cannot be seen together, okay? And we definitely cannot talk on the phone. As much as it breaks my fuckin' heart to say this, if things go well you and Iwill never see each other again. Tommy's gonna be our go between. We will communicate with Tommy, using these. Every Tuesday morning I will ask you gentlemen to smash them into little fuckin' bits with a ball-peen hammer, dump those bits into a tub of acid, don't worry, I'll get you new ones. Tommy? You still with me here? - Yeah, ball-peen fucking hammerbaby. - All right. Now, Timmy I'm gonna need your pick the morning of, okay? That way I have all data finessethe line.

Gentlemen, we only talk in code,okay? Always assume that someone's listening even though you do as I say, use these little ping fuckers, nobody will be. - Uh, what kinda code? - Very good. We're gonna use Tommy's brothers. - My brothers? - Yeah. - You just said it was only us three. - No, no, Tommy for fuck's sake, for the code. For, would you put this shit down? Jesus Christ. Your brother Chuck, he lives in Philly right? - Right. - Okay, so he's the home team. His brother Johnny lives in Jersey. That's the away team. - Oh. - All right? Whatever number you happen to bring up in any given conversation, that's the line that Tim's workin' from, you understand? - I understand. - Uh... - Good. Guys, nobody can know about this shit but us. All right? You keep your heads down, your mouths shut, there's no reason we can't do this forever. Oh, for fuck's sake, are you kiddin' me? - Tommy, who the fuck are theseguys? - Uh, Steph, back to bed hun. I'll be in in one minute okay? - What time is it? - Is she even legal Tommy? - Hey, watch your God damn mouth. Hey, uh, these are just some old friends of mine Steph. It's okay. And for your information she's 23. - I'm 22 asshole. - Yeah, I know. Back to bed hun, please. Hey, what's the matter? What are you, 14? Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. She's a total pothead. - Shape up you two fuckin' assholes, all right? I got three kids to put throughcollege. - Hey. Guess who I bumped into down at the New Jersey Airport? Your brother Johnny. - In Newark? - Newark, New Jersey, Tommy, right? - What the hell would Johnnybe doin' at the Newark Airport? - I don't know Tommy, maybe he's catchin' a fight at 7:30 p.m. - No, I'm meetin' Johnny for lunch in like 45 minutes. - Are you serious dude? - Hang on, hang on. - Tommy? - Hey, relax. Dunce, I got it. You saw my brother Johnny at the New Jersey Airport. Wheels up at 7:30. I got it. - Yeah? - Bad news Baba. My brother Johnny got diagnosed with ball cancer by a doctor in New Jersey. He's got seven and a half monthsto live. - Seven and a half months. - Terrible ain't it? - Yeah, really fuckin' heart breaking. - Seriously Baba? - Yeah. - On a pink phone? - All right. Tommy, I'll call you back. Would you, I just need five minutes. Okay, five minutes. Hey, it's Baba, can I talk to him? - There a problem Baba? - Look, you got 60 on New Jersey plus the points and I'm just movin' your orders and I'm happy to do it for ya but I think it might go the other way. - You tellin' me how to do my job? - I'm just tellin' you what I think. - Well, my computer thinks otherwise. - Well, my computer's not a computer. All I'm sayin' is I got a pretty decent hunch that I wouldn't wanna bet your hard earned money against. - Oh, my money's not hard earned, mostly 'cause I don't bet hunches. - All right, so what? 60 on New Jersey then? - Uh uh. 120 on Detroit. I'm gonna put my money where your mouth is. - You won't regret it. Uh, take the car. I'll meet ya at home. Want tacos tonight kiddo? - I can't get that much cash without dipping into your retirement. - I understand. Look, and believe me when I tell you I know exactly what the fuck I'm asking you to do here Katie. Now please, I need 200 large split up evenly into these five offshore accounts. - Offshore accounts are like a bad signal to the IRS. And to do what? Don't tell me you're gonna gamble it. - No, no, no, no, no. No, it's a, you know, it's an investment opportunity. - Investment in what? - It's a you know, an old friend. - Oh yeah, turn the game off. - Donaghy's reffin'. - That's fucked up. - No, oh Steph. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Steph, listen. I wanna say this. I've been thinkin' a lot lately about the future. You know? About kids, birthdays. - Diapers and Disney World? - Yeah. - Are you fucking with Tommy - No, no, I'm serious Steph. Maybe it's time I grew up. You know? Maybe it's time we settled down. The two of us. - I mean, we're about to fuck onthe couch between a pizza box and a water bong but... Seriously? - Yeah. Seriously. - I'm ready if you are. - Ready. This person is dead. - Hey, you ready to make some money? - There's only .3 seconds left. That ain't enough time for a tip but he's got bother zeros. - Tommy, Tommy, please be quiet, okay? Thank you. - Isn't the game already over? - Mm mm. - Detroit's winning by six. - Uh, we need Detroit to win byeight. - Why do we need them to win byeight? - Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Could we please shut her the hell up before she mushes the God damn bet? - Sorry, he's under a lotta stress right now. - Yeah, obviously . He's three times the size of a regular douche bag. - So, we spotted New Jersey seven and a half points at the tip off. So Detroit is winning the game but they're not covering their spread. - Shut, the fuck, up! - Okay now. One down, one to go. - All right. - Since when do you smoke? - What, you got pills? - Pills, are you kiddin' me Baba? - You on oxi big guy? - You ain't supposed to be touchin' any of that shit. - Come on.

Congratulations. Look, I need you to get me somecoke. - No, no, no. I ain't your guy for that. No. - You're a drug dealer Tommy. - I sell pot. Pot won't fuck your life up. - Oh really? - Yeah, really. - Yeah? Are you sure about that? I'm good to you Tommy. I give you 500 bucks a pop just to drive me up here so you can fuck whores behind a dumpster while I give the wheel a couple spins. - Hey, I fucked her in the bathroom. - Oh, you're a real class act. You gonna do this for me or not? - Very nice babe, very nice. - Hey, fuck nuts. - Hey . - How are ya? Good to see ya. - So uh, you got my apple brother? - Yeah, I got your apples and they're itching - He's cute . - me like a mother fuck... Oh. Hiya. - Don't stop on our account Tommy. Oh, I'm Priya. I'm win Tim. - Yeah? - Mm hm. - And you are? - With you. My name's Sasha. What do you say we uh, take that shirt off? I've never seen $40,000 in reallife. - You two sit tight all right? Come here. You told them about the money? - So what? It's not like I told them the truth about where we got it. - Well, what did you tell 'em? - I told 'em you were a pot dealer. - Timmy, how fuckin' dumb do yougotta be to tell a couple of hookers that I just flew across the country with... Oh, Jesus Christ. With $40,000 in drug money taped to my chest? - How dumb do you have to be to strap $40,000 to your tits for a domestic fucking flight? - There's a 10k limit on cash bro. - That's for international flights. This is Arizona, dude. - Huh? Are you fucking kidding me? Ah, fuck. - And they're not hookers although they act like hookers when theyget drunk. Sasha's an old friend. I just thought, you know, one last hurrah before you tie the knot again. Come on Tommy. Let's go get drunk. Come on. We're back. - Hey. - Oh hey. - Hi . - Ah. - What's this? - Volume of NBA wages went ballistic last month. There's a global shift with most of the money changing hands offshore. The point spreads were acting just as crazy. - Meaning what? - Meaning heads up. Central suspects possible link to organized crime. This thing looks sophisticated. - So um, me and Kim are goin' through a rough patch. She says all I do is work and play golf, and family's not my first priority. - Uh, she has a point. - Maybe a little. Look, I know I can be a scumbag Tommy but Christ, what does she expect? You know, it's not like I don't love her and the girls. It's just I, I need the fuckin' action, you know? - Yeah. Hey, speakin' of, how does it all work any way? With the picks? - My job puts me on the inside,right? So, I know things that regular guys don't. Unreported injuries, bad blood between refs and players. It's... - So you're 78% accurate on locker room info? - It's a, it's a complicated game Tommy. It's full of judgment calls, biases. Let me ask you, do you understand the defensive three second rule? Hm? Nobody does. Nobody. - Selective enforcement? - Maybe or maybe it's just natural tendencies that happen to break my way, hm? - That influenced the outcome ofa game? You ever feel bad about that? - About what? The naked chicks on my couch of the 40 grand in my carryon? - Sure. But there's always somebody on the other side of these bets, right? - Yeah, you're right there is. A fucking gambler, Tommy. Seriously though, I mean who's the victim here? Who? The players? They're gettin' paid millions of dollars a year, they only play defense in the fourth quarter and they spend the entire game bitchin' me out. The fans? Please. Come on. I mean, they're gettin' a pro game either way. - I thought you loved this game? - I love the game we played as kids. Tommy, we learned a team game. Five on five, unselfish play, all for one, one for all. I mean, pro hoops is anything but that. It's star driven. Offensive skills showcase. I mean you can't play his zone defense but you can take a third step on a fast break if you jam the mother fucker. It's basically cheating Tommy. - Well, I'd play that game if Icould. - Yeah, well I am playing that game the only way they'll let me and guess what? I'm jammin' the mother fucker. Me. We cannot let Baba fuck it up. - Listen to this. - I need answer numb nuts. The Bobcats and line just jumped two fuckin' point for no reasonat all. Well, we all know this ain't magic, right? Some of 'em got their hands inside the NBA's cookie jar and we need to find out who the fuck it is. Have I made myself clear? Or are you just stupid? - I want a run down on every NBAgame for the last six weeks where the line jump more than two points. - What are we looking for? - People. - Oh! - You're not even trying, Dad. - No, I am sweetheart. I just suck at shuffleboard. - Oh, okay. - Yo! - Oh, Uncle Tommy's here sweetheart. Why don't you go upstairs, get yourself a snack okay? Come back down in 20 minute. - What's up Mary B? Donaghy said the line moves are a huge red flag. He's worried you're bettin' too much on his game. - Oh, okay . What do you say Tommy? - I don't wanna get caught. - Mm, mm hm. He give you his pick for tonight? - Chuck's comin' to dinner at six p.m. - Good, very good. Okay, so Elvis likes Denver minus six. - Yeah. - What do you think I should do? - You should bet hard on Denverminus six. - Mm hm. We could but wouldn't it be better for us to bet Denver minus three? - Sure but the line is six. - Come here. Have a seat Tommy. I'm gonna show ya how I make the fuckin' donuts. Is everybody there? - We're all here big guy. What do you got? - Okay listen. Denver's layin' six to Utah. Bet Utah hard getting anything more than three. You got that Buckley? - Balls to the walls on Utah to win. Got it. - Balls on the fuckin' railroad track. - Got it. - Okay, now get the fuckin' position and report back so I can keep track. - You just bet the wrong team dude. - Maybe, maybe not. But remember the point is Denver minus three, okay? Watch this. See what I just did there? - You bet $80,000 on Utah plus six to win. - Now close your eyes and wait for it. - Wait for what? - Close your fuckin' eyes. Go ahead. - Major line move, major line move, major line move. - It's droppin' at five and a half. - That's right, and the whole world is watching. You see Tommy, these six offshore websites, they report line changes in realtime. 80k in 20 seconds on a random ass Tuesday night regular season game, that can only happen for one reason. The smart money, the pro money, the steam is on Utah. - Ah. - Right now two things are happening. A, the halfway intelligent followers are getting their money down onUtah as fast as possible to get that number while it lasts, because B, the sports books are now adjusting their lines downward to attract clueless squares to put their money down on the wrong side of the bet. - Utah to win 10 grand. - Which is actually the right side. - Hey, now he gets it. - And only three people on the planet know about it. - Major line move, major line move, major line move. - The line's at four and a half. - Yeah, it'll take awhile to getto three. - But Baba-- - You wanna play some shuffleboard? - Hey, this is exactly what Donaghy's worried about. Red flag city. - You fuckin' worry too much, that's the problem. - Jazz Nuggets just dropped. That's the third game this week. - Better you than me. - It's every NBA game for the last six weeks where the line moved more than two points. - Shit. - Three and a half. - We're gonna bury this mother fucker the second it hits three. Hey Buckley, change of plans. I need you to max bet Denver forme. Everything you can get me all the way up to six. Loop in the other guys okay? I want updates ASAP. - On it. - Nice. We're only letting three for the first million in play. - You just bet a million dollars? - Yeah, so far. - So far? - Yeah. - How you doin' Baba? - Hey, what do you got the Denver game at? - Five and a half. - 'Kay, can you give me 100 dimes on Denver minus the points? - I'll do 70. - Okay, bet it. Hey. How'd we do? - 10 dimes at four and a half. - Very interesting story. Listen kid, next time text. Every last dollar counts Tommy. - Major line move, major line move, major line move. - It's up to six and a half. - Oh. Remind me, where did we start again? - Six. - Isn't that nice? A little half point swing. Hey, remind our good friend Elvis Presley to stick to singin'. - Wait so, what the fuck is up with Cammy's wrist? - It's not his wrist, it's a finger. - A big day for Nay-Nay huh? - No, Nay-Nay has got some kindof a knee. - Wait, they're both hurt? - Mm hm. - So, who do they have left forcenter? - Jamal Sampson. - Who? - Exactly. Big day for Carlos Boozer. - Hey, change of plans brother. Chuck hurt himself at work. Can't make dinner tonight. Johnny's in. - No, no, no, no, no. It has to be Chuck! - No, trust me it's Johnny all right? Dinner doesn't start for anotherhour. - Dinner started at 10 a.m. dunce. - Look, just tell the chef what's up. Either way Johnny's comin'. - Yeah, what? - Dinner's fucked bro. - How bad? We're eatin' with the wrong guy. - Well, you can't win 'em all Tommy. - Yeah, but-- - Listen, we were three for four last week, we'll be three for four this week. I'm tellin' you we can't fuckin'lose. Hey, by the way when can you getme another bag of that stuff that you got me? - The bag I brought you this morning? - Yeah, that one. ♪ He's lookin' good ♪ He's lookin' good ♪ He's got rings of diamonds ♪ The face of the world ♪ Holdin' toothpicks are part of bein' a girl ♪ ♪ Rose number ain't got a hold on me ♪ ♪ Choose a pattern ♪ Or go on and be extinct ♪ It ain't good ♪ All the man is bad ♪ Looking good ♪ Looking good ♪ Looking good - What is this shit Baba? Are you usin' again? - Baby doll, no, no, no, no. I just, you know, I play a little online poker before my Ambien kicks in. What's the big fuckin' deal? - What the hell is wrong with you? You playin' a game of chance against a computer program? - All right, hey, I gamble for aliving. - Bullshit, you're a mover. You haven't gambled in 15 fuckin' years. - I was up 20 grand last night. - The computer says you're down$100,000. - Hm? - Oh my God. - No. - I'm gonna be sick. - No, no, hey, hey baby doll? No, hey, look, no, no, sweetie, that's, hey, hey, that's not ourmoney. No, that's not, that's The Chinaman's money. It's just, technically it's hisaccount. Look, sweetheart it's just a little holdover until I can catch another hot streak. - Oh my God. You disgusting fuck. He know he's making you that loan? - No, no, kitten, listen, listen. Come on, it's under control, allright? - We got a good thing here Baba. We built this together over 20 God damn years. Jesus Christ your fuckin' kids are sleepin' right upstairs. I never gave up on you before. Do not fuck it up now. - I won't. Hey, hey. I won't. Come here. - Donaghy called that reach, right? - Yeah. - So it was definitely a reach? - I'm no ref but yes, definitely. - All right. What about this? There's three in the lane. - More like four in the lane. I'm tellin' you, every whistle seems legit. - He's gotta be fixin' these games. - Evidence would be nice. - Don't say it asshole. - There's only one asshole here. - Yeah, all right. I'm tellin' you, don't. - If only we betted on the sixers. What the hell? - Wait a fuckin' sec! - Baba! - Baba! Nobody came here to fight Baba. - Look. See this? There's $200,000 here. All right? Now, I know I should've asked before I borrowed it, but I can make the rest up in aweek. You fuckin' know that. - Tell your friend to exit the car. - No fuckin' way. - Get outta the car Tommy. - Baba-- - It's fine, all right? You're fine, just do what the man says all right? And we'll get outta here. - What's your name beautiful? - Tommy. - Tommy. Now use your imagination Baba, and pretend Tommy's your wife, Debbie. - Aw, come on! - Now pretend he's your firstborn daughter. - No, no, ah! - Or your second born. Now see where this is headed genius? - Yeah. - Now I like you Baba. You are smart, you're discreet, you're honest 99% of the time. So you hang onto this for now, okay? See if your NBA ref friend can't magically turn it into 1.2 million for ya. - What ref? - You have exactly one week. - Tommy? You got a gun? - Fuck you! I, I quit. I fuckin' quit. - All right. Tommy, look. Tommy come on, let's, just you home all right? Look, tell Donaghy his next pick is good for 20 grand but I needhim to guarantee a win okay? I need a lock. - He's not that fucking good. - No, no, Tommy he has to. All right? He has to or else they're gonna kill me. Do you realize this Tommy? They're gonna fucking kill me. I can't afford to gamble anymore. I need a fuckin' lock! - Thank you. - Thank you. As you know Mr. Donaghy, we're with the Organized Crime Division. But a recent investigation has us watching a lot of basketball which is uh, a bit outside of our comfort zone. - You come highly recommended as a subject matter expert who can also help us with our request in discretion. - Of course. Whatever you need. - How possible would it be for a rogue official to manipulate game outcomes in away that completely avoids detection? - Manipulate how? - We're looking for a guy who's final scores tend to favor the big money. - Shave points is one thing. To do it well. - It's a 80% success rate. - Well, you'd have to be pretty damn talented. I can name 30 guys in my league who couldn't do that. It's um, highly unlikely but possible. - So we just need a good enoughref who associates with bad enough people. - Ah. Are you um, looking at a D-1 ref? - Pro actually. - Mm hm. - Is that your son? - Timmy, yeah. I always dreamed of goin' pro but he actually did it. - Hey, he went to Cardinal O'Hara High School in 1985? He wouldn't happen to know a guy named James Battista wouldhe? - Baba, why? - I'm just askin'. - I haven't heard that name in years. - All right. Now you remember what I taught you, yeah? Finger right on the needle point. - I know. - Face, follow through. Try a couple. Hey Pops. - Listen Son, I need to know something from you in no uncertain terms. - Yeah, sure. Anything. - Have you been in touch with Baba? - Baba? Uh, why? - I just need to know that's all. - No. - Let's keep it that way, okay? - Why, what's up? - I think the FBI's looking at his NBA business. I wouldn't want anybody to get the wrong idea. - All right, game time. - Go, go, go! - What happened to your face? - Baba sucked up bro. - You got my apples though, right? Tommy? He owes me 50 fucking grand. - He owes The Chinaman 1.2 million dollars. - He said if we keep these betssmall-- - We didn't. Baba's in deep shit though. Your next pick's gotta be a lock. - I'm out. I quit. - What? No. No, no, no, no, no. Not yet, not now. - We had a good run Tommy but this shit-- - He need one more pick dunce. The pick that saves his God damnlife. - The fuckin' FBI knows Tommy. They talked to my father about Battista. This is about my life, you understand me? My career, my family. - How much did they know? Because I know for a fact that The Chinaman's gonna kill Battista. He's gonna fuckin' kill him dunce. - Jesus Christ. This is nuts. Look I... I'm sorry. I can't be a part of this anymore. - Tim-- - No, no. I'm out. I'm out. - No. Fuck! - And who the fuck is The Chinaman, huh? - We all good fellas? - Not even close. - Did you tell him it's 40 grand. - It's not about the money you fuck. - The FBI's onto us. - Yeah, no shit. The fed's have been parked outside my house for three fuckin' weeks. You know what that means? It means they're still lookin' for proof all right? What we're doin' ain't remotely fuckin' provable. Guys, I don't keep records. All right? We're talkin' on burner phones for fuck's sake and Elvis, you're a genius with a whistle in your mouth okay? Nobody can do what you do. And nobody can prove it unless we told 'em ourselves. Just one more game dunce. Please. Fuckin' please. - They can't prove any of this? - Not unless we help 'em. - I'll do it for 30. - All right. Listen, I need it in the next six days and Timmy, it's gotta be a lock. - You all right? - I just guaranteed a lock Tommy. Nobody can guarantee a lock. - You're the one holdin' the whistle dude. - Hello. - Uh, it's Katie Carrick. Is he around? - Hang on, I just walked in. No, he's not here. Why, what's up? - Uh, it's best if we speak direct. Have him call me as soon as possible. - Is anything the matter? It's my money too, Katie. - You're not gonna like this but the important thing is don'tpanic. - Yo, Tommy! - Yeah? - That's a porno site, so what? - These are hookers Tommy. - I only look at the pictures. - Well according to this bitch Brandi, you two had sex at the Flounder's Hotel. - You weren't supposed to see that. - Oh, in that case, my mistake! - Steph, wait. It was meaningless. - Yeah, to Brandi maybe. Not to me! - It was a two star hotel in Clifton. I was drunk and stupid and I amdisgusted with myself and it'll never happen again I swear it. I love you Steph! I, I love you! Please, don't go. I am, this has been really hard but I'm trying, I'm trying to be better. No more gambling, no more dealing, no more girls. Nothing. Just us. I swear it. I just need you to stay. Just tell me what I gotta do to get you to stay. - You know how my dad bets the NBA? - Did you know your brother Chuck fucked seven hookers in Thailand? - Oh, that's so interesting. Yeah, did he put that in his Christmas card to you? - Mr. M? - Yeah, hello Timothy, I'm here,right. - Uh, my bad. I was lookin' for Tommy. - Yeah, you're on speaker champ. I'll call you back in two minutes. - Did you hear the thing I said about Chuck? - Yeah. - You know Chuck has never been to Thailand? You know that right? Seven in one, what's this guy, nuts? - What the fuck Baba? - Debbie kicked me out. - How did you even get in here? - I knew if I could get in then so could they. Listen Steph uh, watch your back all right? And uh, let me know if you see anybody who looks even fuckin' remotelyChinese. Yeah? - We got dinner with Chuck at seven. - Tonight? - Tonight. - That's less than three hours from now. I'm already boxed into these fuckin' numbers Tommy. - He says it's water tight. - All right. Chuck at seven. - Do me a favor, Dad. Say a little prayer for Chuck. - Chuck's in Punta Cana, Tommy. - Different Chuck. - What the hell you boys are upto. - Look, Miami's laying seven at home to Orlando. Okay? I want you to put everything that you fuckin' can on the Heat line and no more that seven. All right. - You got any money at play tonight? - Not yet but my guy likes Orlando with Miami. - Orlando? - Yeah. - Miami's won nine in a row. - Miami's layin' seven with D-Weight on the bench. - You should go the other way, Dad. - You know I pay 80 bucks a weekfor picks and I'm sharper than you think Iam. - I'm just sayin', so am I. - You gotta be kiddin' me. - You should go the other way, Dad. - You know we love you, Son, no matter what, right? Christ Almighty, Tommy, Tommy. All right, go on. - To win. 50 dimes on Miami minus seven. - I'm so sorry about this. Hey, listen to me, the thing you talked about before with your father... - Oh, you're gonna fuck me with the extra juice now? - He's on it. Miami to go for seven. - Yeah. - Baba won't shut the fuck up about it. How long is he gonna be here? - All right, all right fine. Wait, what? Minus seven, minus 120? All right, just bet 48 dimes towin. Minus seven on Miami. It's Baba4545. What's up Tommy? - It's magic Heat tonight. - Hello. - Hey Son, I just called to wish you lunch tonight. - Oh, thanks. - I'll be watchin'. - You're uh, you're gonna watch the Miami game? - Yeah, it's either that or the "Seinfeld" reruns. Plus, somebody from church said that the points spread was actin' kinda crazy and nobody knew why. - Oh, really? I uh, hadn't heard anything. - Oh, of course not. Anyway, I'll let you get to it. Have fun out there. - Yeah, always do. Thanks. - I just bet my entire life on Miami. What do you say? You wanna sweat it in with me? - Listen Baba, if you don't mind I'm kinda in the doghouse here tryin' to claw my way out. - Oh yeah, you and me both. - So. - I gotta fuckin' go home. I should go home. - Okay, good. Hey? Good luck tonight. - Fuck luck. Elvis lives . ♪ And I'm losing my mind - You okay Tim? ♪ And I'm losing my mind - Dad's here. - Where were you? - I was uh, sorry kids. I've just been busy with work okay? But everything's gonna be fine. Elvis Presley lives. All right. Good bread, good meat, good God, let's eat, huh? - Honey, you look tired. Maybe you should take a nap. - I'm fine, I'm totally fine. Kids, you wanna watch some basketball? Well, what do we got here? Oh, this looks great. Mm. That's wonderful. What is it? - It's a pork chop. - Yeah? Well, it's the best pork chop I've ever had. - They're left overs. - Who gives a shit? It's fuckin' awesome. - Hey. - What? What kinda call was that? - No, that can't be right. - Are you kidding me? What kinda call is that Tim? You're killin' me out here. - What the fuck dunce? How the fuck is that a foul? - Baba, you are scaring the kids. Talk to me, please. What is going on? - Shh! - How 'bout I just turn the TV off? - Shh, no! Don't you fuckin' dare Deb. - Watch me. - Mom! - Kids, go upstairs. Baba? Kids I mean it. Go upstairs. - He's taking histime now setting up the play. - Hey, look at, look at me. - I just wanna, no, hey, come on, I just wanna watch thegame. I fucked up really bad. - Hey! Hey! I've known you half my life Jimmy. There is nothing we can't fix. You hear me? Nothing we can't fix okay? - He's fouling out the wrong fucking team. Don't open the door for anybody! - I need you to come down and set a screen, a good one. And make sure you got... - Tim? We're back. - He looks good out there. - All right. - My dad loves you by the way. - To new beginnings. - Mm. Not so fast dirt bag. You dug yourself a pretty deep hole. - Dirt bag? - Mm hm. - Get her outta here, we need totalk! - It's okay, she's cool. - She's not fuckin' cool! She knows everything Baba. - Nobody's fuckin' cool! The game just ended. - What was the score? - My dad's gonna be so pissed. - Holy shit. - Come on. - Oh, holy shit. - You had a heart attack, Dad. - But the doctors say everythinggonna be okay, right Mary? Go tell the nurses Daddy's awake. - Thank you sweetheart. Don't worry honey, I'll take-- - You actually OD'd on coke and pills right after you bankrupted this fuckin' family you fat fuckin' douche. - Okay. Look, honey I can make this right. - You just took your last big pisses in the biggest fuckin' diaper I've ever seen. You can't do shit right now. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna call The Chinaman. - Ya need to go to fuckin' rehab. - Debbie, please with the rehab. Don't-- - Relax. I'm takin' care of it. Look, there's only one way you make this money back, unless shorty over here thinks he can pound two pennies out of my fat disgrace of a husband. Settle down Sensei. Pete and Baba came up together. Philly, Vegas, Curacao, booking, bet and moving. When Baba's his best, he's the best there is. When he's not, Pete is. So my proposition is this. Let Pete move your money for half of Baba's rate. You keep the other half for yourself. If that's not a reliable paymentplan, I don't know what the fuck is. - You think he'd do the same foryou? - I'm not doin' shit for that prick. I'm doin' this for me. This is a great opportunity Sir, and I am not enough of an asshole to fuck it up. - My husband gave you 10 good years. There's 10 more if you want 'em. - James Battista? - No fuckin' comment. - That's a subpoena. You're going to appear before a federal grand jury in New York. - You came all the way from New York for that? - Smart money says cooperate. - Have a nice ride home asshole. - Oh, I'm not going home. My partner and I are just gettin' started. Enjoy your ice cream. - Suck it shut. - I'm sweatin' this Baba. I'm sweatin' this hard. - Look, don't all right? They might know what we did but they can't prove that we did it. - What if Donaghy talks? - Tommy, Donaghy can't say anything without admitting that he bet his own games. All right? The second he does that he ruins his career and torpedoes his entire fuckin'life. - Oh fuck. That's them. - Okay, relax. Tommy, listen, they got nothing,okay? Believe me, they got nothin'. We're good. - Yep? - Hello Thomas. - Hello. - Agent Harris, Federal Bureau of Investigation. - Oh. How can I help you Agent Harris? - A better question is how can you help yourself? That's a subpoena to appear before a federal grand jury. U.S. Attorney wants to ask you a few questions. - Can I take the Fifth right now, or is that somethin' that I gotta show up in person to do? - I like you Tommy. Try not to fuck yourself too hard on this. - Tim Donaghy? Jerry Conrad, FBI. - Oh, what can I do for you Agent Conrad? - Best way to protect yourself is to tell me your side of the story. - Uh, uh, protect myself from what? - The other side of the story. The one that protects Tommy andBaba. You don't know it yet but you're in a free fall. How well you land is entirely upto you. Either way, you've reffed your last NBA game. - Bullshit. - It's already done. - Oh hey, sorry I'm late. I was just at the range. - The FBI stopped by today. - The FBI? Well, what for? - When are you gonna stop lying? - No, no, honey I swear to God, I don't wanna- - Stop. They told me everything. Jesus, Tim. What have you done to this family? - I bet on some of my own games,Dad. Just a few small bets I couldn'tpass up. And Baba took them. - Wish I could say I'm more surprised but, Christ. You're the kid who cheated on your SAT's, so, of course you're fixin' ballgames. - I never said I fixed, I said Ibet. - I know about the line rows Timmy. I've seen the outcomes. Are you honestly gonna sit there, before me, before God and tell me you never fixed a game? - Yes, that's what I'm sayin'. - Okay, good. Now you look me in the eye and you tell me that again. You tell me you never fixed a God damn game. You remember who you're talkin'to Son. - I never made, a bad call. - My whole life I've never beenproud of anything the way I was proudof you. - Really? 'Cause that's news to me. - You had so much potential. I tried to nurture it. I taught ya everything I could. Respect, rules, integrity. And you still managed to break my heart. - Yeah, just like I knew I always would. I always came up short in your mind didn't I? Huh? Not smart enough, not good enough, right? Not fast enough. I did everything I could to make you proud of me. Everything! I even became a ref. It's not somethin' I wanted formyself. I did it for you. - It's a respectable job Tim. - Is it? - It is the way I do it. You wanna make me proud? Your low life friends got you into this mess, you gotta get yourself out on your own. - We're gonna do just fine, Dad. We got a plan. - No! You need your own plan! You gotta do what's right for you! For your family! - They are my best friends. - They are not your friends anymore. This isn't a God damn debate! Fix this. You're the only one who can. - Like old times huh? Don't worry boss, piece of cake. - The state will show that between December, 2006 and March, 2007, the defendant, Timothy Donaghy, Thomas Martino, and James Battista engaged in a conspiracy, to illegal transmit wagering information related to games played within theNational Basketball Association. Mr. Donaghy, an NBA referee, transmitted non public, confidential information that he obtained during his official capacity, to two co conspirators, to be used for betting on games. - The fact that they call it the Princeton Offense, gives the impression that you need a 1600 on your SAT's to execute a simple backdoor pass. The Philly suburbs proved that theory wrong. - Is it true that you make yourliving as a professional bookmaker? - Is it true you passed the New York State Bar Exam on your third try? - You don't need to be smart to get your teammate an open layup. You just need big enough balls to screen it big on his behalf. - They don't got shit. All for one Timmy. All right? This is ours to lose. - Did you ever use a telephone across state lines to relate betting information from Timothy Donaghy to James, Baba, Battista? - Nah. That's the life we learned in Delco. We tested loyalty everyday. We bled for each other, we lied for each other. All for one and one for all. Whatever you wanna call it, we thought it would last forever. - Did you ever wager on games that you officiated as an employee of the National Basketball Association? - Yes. Yes, I did. I um... - It only took four months to destroy. - He just fucked us. - I'm not proud of some of the things I've done. But I also believe that my family's well being was at stake. It's something I have to make right, I understand that. As far back as December, 2006, I was betting on teams and games I was officiating. I placed those bets with James Battista, Tommy Martino. - That's bullshit. That's fuckin', that's... I'm sorry, that's bullshit. - Donaghy sold us out like you couldn't fuckin' believe. Said me and Baba were gangstersand that we threatened to kill his family if we didn't give him picks. It was obvious bullshit, sure, but I've never known a better bullshitter. Every friendship has its threshold. Once Tim's father got involved, me and Baba didn't stand a chance. It probably ain't a bad thing we screwed it all up as fast aswe did. If we kept goin' any longer, God knows where we'd be now. Bottom of a lake maybe or a tub of fuckin' acid. So who knows really? Maybe that fucker saved our lives.
