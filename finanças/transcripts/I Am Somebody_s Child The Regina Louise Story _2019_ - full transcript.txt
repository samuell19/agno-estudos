(♪♪♪) Mama! Mama! (♪♪♪) Regina: My whole life I wanted to hear how I came into the world a wanted and special child. (♪♪♪) But for the first 13 years of my life, it seemed nobody wanted me. You lost? I'm here for a place to stay. Yeah, what's your name? Regina Louise. How old are you? Thirteen. (sigh) Where are we goin'? I'm taking you to the children's centre. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (door buzzer) (♪♪♪) I've got Regina Louise. Great, can you sign here, please? Hi Regina. Thanks a lot. Bye Regina. (footsteps) (♪♪♪) (click) (♪♪♪) Good night. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Regina: All my life I wanted to be somebody's someone... instead of feeling like just another nobody. (♪♪♪) (click) Morning Sunshines! Up, up, up! Out of bed, sleepy heads. Rise and shine, it's a beautiful day. (♪♪♪) Hi Regina. I'm Miss Kerr. Welcome to the shelter. I'll get you set up. Come with me. Up and at 'em! (♪♪♪) That's Miss Happy Trails. You go on with Happy Trails, girl. (♪♪♪) We keep your jewelry in your personal safe. They'll be waiting for you when you leave. Oh, nice mood ring. You have a purse? How about your pockets? Don't throw that away! That has my mama's lipstick on it from when she kissed me last. Oh! (♪♪♪) Here, you can change just there. There are privacy curtains. (♪♪♪) How'd you get that bruise on your arm? I bumped into a refrigerator. Mm-hmm. How old were you when you got hurt on your legs? I don't remember. Well, that must have hurt a lot. Who did that to you? I was on a ball team. Would you mind, please, standing up? (♪♪♪) May I please lift up the back of your shirt? Wait, what do you need to see my back for? I just need to finish my report. Do you mind? I'll just lift up the back of your shirt. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) How'd you get those scars on your back? Playing. Playing what? Games. Games? Someone do that to you? No. Okay. Your time here is limited, so you make the most of it. And your goal is to be a gold star girl. Gold stars are good and red stars are bad. Nobody wants a red star. Have you understood everything I've told you? (♪♪♪) (car horn honking) Regina: It seemed like everyone went home to their someone over the weekend... Have a good weekend. Thank you, bye. ...except for me. See you on Monday. Regina: And if they couldn't be picked up, they got in Miss Ford's car and she delivered them to a home where they might get a chance. Have a good weekend. (car door slams) (♪♪♪) How are we doing with our little Regina? Regina, Regina has lived in illegal pay care situations since birth. In one home she was viciously and repeatedly beaten. The scars were ugly. We've all seen scars, Jeanne. Well, this weekend she confided that the abuser was an older child, no relation, living in the same quasi foster home in Texas. She's only had sporadic contact with her mother, whereabouts unknown. She most recently lived with her father for 6 months until she ran away. She worries her dad is angry with her, but she's eager to make it work. I'm happy to report he's coming today. Good. Your father and stepmother are here. (♪♪♪) Hi Sam. Hi Nadine. (♪♪♪) I'll wait outside. This is between Regina and her father. Oh, Mrs. Lock, a Regina's stepmother, you're welcome to join the meeting. No thank you. (♪♪♪) (footsteps) Did Regina tell you that my wife and I took her in for 6 months? Did she tell you that she alienated my children and nearly destroyed my marriage? Mr. Lock, all due respect, Regina is also your child. That we do not know, and I have sincere doubts. Before I gave my life to the Lord, I had relations with Regina's mother. But I'm no longer that man. I've married Nadine, with whom I have a family, with whom I have built a life. I can be good. My wife and I took in Regina out of the goodness of our hearts, and she repaid us with theft, deceit and violence towards my wife. I ain't mean to hit her. Mr. Lock, I can only imagine how upsetting, hurtful and frightening it must have been for you when Regina ran away from home. The children... Wait a minute, did she tell you she ran away from home? I ordered her out of my home and I paid a woman to take her in! Miss Bushnell said your checks stopped coming, she locked me out. (♪♪♪) Miss Kerr, listen, I want nothing more to do with this child. I want her out of my life. So, are there other forms, papers I need to sign, what do I do? I promise to be good. Listen, listen, know your Father in Heaven loves you. Learn to put your faith in Him. (♪♪♪) Mr. Lock, do you have any information that could help us find Regina's mother? I'll meet you in the car. You look at her. All sad. Our half hour dinner is turning into a hour, ladies. Let's watch the time. And I told her to your face, you're a worthless piece of shit! What did you say to me?! You want to get some, Sandy, huh? Come on, Sandy! (Sandy: Screaming) Fight, come on, fight, Sandy, fight! Fight, fight, Sandy! Regina! Sandy Blair and Regina Louise, you have just earned yourself red stars. It wasn't my fault, she just freaked. Get in my office! What happened? Regina got angry. No, you got angry. Own up to it, anger's okay. Violence is not and we don't tolerate it here at the shelter. Just across the parking lot is juvie, and is where you'll be detained the next you're violent. Those are the rules! You had a hard day. Your dad gave me some information that may help me find your mother. Let's not lose hope, okay? Yeah, right. Regina Louise, get to my office now! (♪♪♪) Okay, girls, and one, and two... Found your mother. You talked to her? I did. She's coming to see you. Is she coming from Texas? She said she lives in Oakland. I've been in California two years, if she was in Oakland, why didn't she come for me before? (♪♪♪) She said she's coming to see you on Monday. I'm excited for you. That's what she said. (♪♪♪) Give me an I! Girls: I! Give me a C! Girls: C! Girls: Icy! (laughing) Come on, right here. Bring me back one from the mall, will you, purple. (girls chatting) Thank you. Where did you get those shoes? I took 'em. You can't do that. That is unacceptable! What you getting in my face for? That's my business, these are my shoes. No, ma'am, you take those shoes off and you put your shoes back on. Annie, may I borrow the van, please? We are going to apologize to the manager. When my mama sees these ugly ass clothes, she ain't gonna want me! (♪♪♪) (girls reciting jump rope rhymes) Lenny, your mother's here. Cathy, Mira, Sandy, the rest of you girls come inside, your parents will be here soon. Come on, Regina. Where are we goin'? We are going to the fabric store. We're gonna make you a pretty outfit to wear for your mother. (door bell jingling) Corduroy, it has to be corduroy. But that's a pretty warm fabric. But we could make you a sleeveless jumper and you can wear a short T or a long sleeved T, according to the weather. I think that would work, that would give you some versatility. I think so. Ah, this one. Mm-hmm. Star, sun, peace sign? Too white hippy. Um, that one. I want to be a rainbow girl. What do you think? I think you're gonna look beautiful for your mama. (door bell jingling) (sewing machine clicking) How did you learn to do that? My mother taught me. You're in my light. Want to help? Here, come here, hold this like this. Yes. This looks good! Come on. Stand up straight. Regina is the perfect name for you, it means queen. You have a regal spirit. What's regal mean? Look it up in the dictionary. R-E-G-A-L. Pertaining to a king... Or a queen. ...magnificent, splendid. That's right. I am honored to be in your court, your majesty. (♪♪♪) I'm leaving with my mama today, so goodbye and good luck to everybody. Shut up, girl! You worse than Miss Happy Trails. Psst, Miss Kerr. Oh, is your mother here already? No, I'm still waiting for her out front. Can I borrow some of your perfume? Perfume, yes. (♪♪♪) Hold out your wrists. Rub your wrists together, it wakes up the fragrance, and then dab behind your ears, there you go. You're beautiful. Thank you. (♪♪♪) (door buzzer) (hurried footsteps) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) You want some lunch? I already said goodbye to everybody. Here, made you a sandwich, some Cracker Jacks in there, you take it with you. (♪♪♪) You working a double shift? Oh, no, no, I'm out of here. Okay. Hey Regina. (♪♪♪) It's okay. She's done this a thousand times. I'll wait a little bit longer. (♪♪♪) (footsteps) (♪♪♪) (footsteps) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (sobbing) It's me. Oh, oh! (sobbing) You are not going to be alone. You're gonna be okay. (sobbing) You're gonna be all right. (♪♪♪) Thought you were leaving. Your mother forgot somethin'? (screaming) (pow) (♪♪♪) You're going to juvie. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) You okay? Yes. (school bell ringing) (door slams) Miss Kerr is upset. I ain't mean to hit her. Is she hurt bad? No. She's upset because you're in juvie. Miss Kerr put you here because she promised you that she would. Now, she's asked the supervisor to release you just as soon as you've written a letter of apology. A letter of apology? Are you kidding me? A letter to Miss Kerr and to Sandy. Two letters! I ain't mean to hit Miss Kerr, but I should have kicked Sandy's ass! We don't talk like that. She wrote you. She made her write me? Mm-hmm. Why she want everything all nicey-nicey? Now it's your turn. Damn. Dear Miss Kerr, I'm sorry that I hit you in the face. I made a poor choice. I know that I can do better. Sincerely, Regina. Well done. Do you want a cookie? (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (knocking) Hi, my name's Jeanne Kerr, I'm looking for Ruthy Louise. Ruthy. What you need? I'm here about Regina. That crazy girl. Who's Regina? Just, she's just a girl we know, an old friend from Texas. I'll be right back, baby. What the hell are you doing coming in here with that business? On the phone you said that you would come to the shelter on Monday. I changed my mind. What can I do to help you? If you need a ride, if you need us to bring Regina to you, we can do that. You want to help? Then stay the hell out of my life. I got a future ahead of me, do you hear what I'm saying? I'm about to get married. I understand, you are in the middle of a big life change. Regina is almost 14 years old. You don't need to tell me how old my kid is. A girl that age needs to have... Where was my social worker when I was 13 and pregnant and living in a foster home? I was a child having a child. Do you understand that? This is my chance, I get to be happy, that girl was a mistake, and I don't think I should have to pay for that mistake for the rest of my life. Goodbye. Have a good weekend. Bye guys. (car engine running) (car horn honking) Give me an S! Give me a W! I-M! Swim! Come on, Regina, let's go, let's go swimming. I ain't got no swimming suit. Annie, don't we have a swimsuit around here that would fit Regina? Yes, I believe we do. (♪♪♪) (splashing and kids chatting) (splashing and kids chatting) What's wrong? I changed my mind. I don't want to be swallowing other peoples' pee. City pools is for people who ain't got pools at home. Whoever told you that was pulling your leg, come on. Woo, your butt looking like lime green Jell-O jiggling like that. This bowl of Jell-O is jumping in. (splash) Regina, do you know how to swim? Come on, baby, get in the pool, I'll help you. Come on. Come on, Pumpkin, get in the pool, I'll help you. (♪♪♪) First, we have to see what it's like under the water. So, we take a big breath, hold our nose. (♪♪♪) What's it like? Watery, sounds cool though. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Excellent! Now, we blow bubbles. Gonna count first, okay. Both: One, two, three. (♪♪♪) Hey! See this girl, Annie, she's a natural! Woo! (claps) What do you want to do for your birthday? (spitting) How do you tomorrow's my birthday? I saw it on your chart. Anything special you want to do? Go swimming again? Deal. Good night. Yes. (splashing and kids chatting) (♪♪♪) Right, kick off the wall. Kick your legs, kick your legs. Come up for air. Kick your legs, I'm right here. (♪♪♪) Right here, kick your legs, kick you legs, kick your legs, grab the wall! Yeah! How does it feel to be so brave? I did it! You did it. Okay, champ, back you go. Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, come up for air, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, grab the wall now, Regina. Woo! (claps) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (splashing) (kids chatting) (kids chatting) What are you looking at? Annie, take a picture of me with the birthday girl. Absolutely. All right. Cheese. (camera click) Okay. (kids chatting) My mama said that judge can kiss her ass. She got a lawyer trying to get me out of here. I don't want no frizz job. What you doin'? I need more time! Girl, who did you have for weekend duty? Miss Kerr. Happy Trails. Oh, Miss Rise and Shine. Was in a lime green swimsuit, woo! Shakin', jiggling like Jell-O, thighs so white, I was blinded. (zap) Fire! Out! (sizzling) (bang) Ah! Everybody all right? (sigh) What, what I said about the lime green swimsuit, I was just being stupid. You're worried about my lime green jelly. You scared me to death! Please hand me a towel. TV: Screaming I am not doing a very good job. No, you're doing good. You haven't seen it. I can feel it. I can feel you're doing it right. See, it looks good. You all tucked in? Your last name starts with a K. Yes, it does. My last name starts with an I. It means we're right next to each other in the dictionary. Yes, we are. (click) Good night. (click) Yesterday, the court declared you're a ward of the state. What's that mean? If all goes well, you could be adopted. In order to place you, gonna need you to put your best foot forward, Regina. We're gonna need this red star girl you are to become a gold star girl. Do you understand me? Yes. Okay. (♪♪♪) I'm not coming back? If all goes well, no, you won't. Would you like to wear your mood ring? Put it here. Mm-hmm. Tissue? I don't want it no more. (♪♪♪) Regina, this is a wonderful opportunity. You'll do well. (♪♪♪) (door slams) Their names are Mr. and Mr. Rowen, and that is what you will call them until they tell you otherwise. What are their names? Mr. and Mrs. Rowen. Good. Is he okay? (snort) Mr. Rowen has a bad heart. If you act up, he's likely to have a heart attack, so you be good. (snoring) I feel awful. May I be excused? What's wrong with you? I think I got to go to bed, or to the bathroom, or something. I don't feel good. Oh, you got your menses. Look at the mess you're making! I didn't sign up for this! I thought I was getting a child, not a adolescent! I'm not dealing with a teenage girl that might get pregnant on my watch! They don't pay me enough money for this here. You got to get up out of here. Regina: It wasn't even my fault, but Miss Ford looked at me like I was a lost cause. (huff) Miss Kerr took the time to explain my inner workings, but I already knew where babies came from. Boys had been trying to force themselves between my legs for as long as I could remember. Miss Kerr said I was a young lady now, and it was time to see the world. I landed in the ocean. Well, what's the nearest land? Bahamas. I always wanted to go. Let's go.

Hey, pretty girl. Today is our day! Today is indeed our day. What do you call me? Pumpkin. (laughing) You're crazy. I really liked the paintings. Maybe you want to be an artist when you grow up. When I grow up, I want to be a hairdresser. Maybe I'll be a hairdresser to all the stars. You can do anything you put your mind to. But if that doesn't work out, then I want to work with kids the way you do. Not a bad fallback position. The most important thing is to do what you love. Oh, my gosh, we have to go! We don't have to go. I have to get you back to the shelter. Come on. Ou. Oh, honey. I really don't feel good. What's the matter, Pumpkin? It hurts. Oh, my goodness, you are burning up. Come on. (♪♪♪) Come on, right here. Sit here. (♪♪♪) (dialing) (phone ringing) Hi, this is Jeanne Kerr. May I please be connected to the doctor on call? Hi Annie, the doctor says that there is a flu going around, and Regina has it. I'm gonna keep her here with me tonight. Okay, bye. (♪♪♪) Hi. Do you think you can keep down a couple sips of soda? It sits well with you, I'll make you some broth, hmm. I didn't want her to be alone when she was sick. She's had such a hard time being placed. You're the reason I can't place her. That girl sabotaged multiple placements because of her attachment to you. I'm just trying to encourage her. That beautiful spark in her, she is so bright and energic and hopeful. I don't want to see her swallowed up by the world. Do you hear yourself? This is a shelter, it's not a home, don't confuse Regina. She needs to understand who she is and you can't do that for her. You're not to spend anymore time with that girl. (♪♪♪) All these months on the arts and crafts sidelines, and here you are a total pro. We have to hide it from Miss Kerr. Uh, Miss Kerr is not working this week. Why? Uh, Miss Ford rotated her out for a little while. But, you know, we'll, we'll still have a lot of fun. We got lots of new intakes coming. (bang) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... (♪♪♪) Thank you for a lovely evening. I'll call you... soon. Good night. How did you get here?! I walked. It's a right, a left, a right, and then 22 lampposts, to Loral Lane. That's 12 miles, Pumpkin. I like your hair, it looks good. Were you on a date? I saw you kiss him. Annie, I am so sorry for the worry this caused you and Regina is, too. I'll bring her back first thing in the morning. Yeah, I'll Gwen Ford know. Bye. (♪♪♪) I think I understand you. You don't know who you are and you're headed for an identity crisis. But understand this, Regina, you are black, and I see you trying to ingratiate yourself into this white world here with all your cutesy little antics. I don't want to be hanging out with white people. I just want to be with Miss Kerr. She invited me over for Christmas break 'cause I don't have anyplace else to go.

You're stalling, you're stalling. Regina and I saw Tosca last night. Opera is so bourgeois, Jeanne. Why must everything be labeled? Opera comes from the streets of Naples, a lumpenproletariat impulse for the proletariat expropriated by the bourgeoisie. I have no idea what my children are saying. Me neither. What do you think of the opera, Regina? You hate it, right, it's boring. It's boring. Opera's good. See, she hates it, she's being nice. She just appreciates culture. You don't have to lie, it's okay. You're so polite. She's compulsively honest. Merry Christmas, Pumpkin. Okay, ready? Both: One, two, three. (paper rustling) (♪♪♪) I made this, and Miss Sandy gave me the pot. It's a plant holder. It's the most beautiful plant holder I've ever seen. The Collegiate Dictionary. Regina Louise, you put my name on it. What's collegiate mean? Okay. B, C, college, collegiate. Adjective; Of or belonging to a college containing, connected with, or having the status of a college. I love it. Thank you! Okay, yes, we'll talk soon, bye-bye. How was your white Christmas? My Christmas was lovely, thank you. How about yours? Oh, it was fine. I found a placement for Regina. Can you get her personals, please, and have her ready by noon? This is good news. Yes, it is. I know that you'll do well. Now, I want you to cooperate with Miss Ford. Show her that you are a big girl. And if you ever feel lonely, or discouraged, I just want you to call me. (♪♪♪) How far away do they live? Don't even think about walking back, Regina. Coach and his wife have only taken in boys over the years. You're gonna make this work, child. I'm out of options for you. Do you understand me? Yes. Byron's come to us 3 years ago now. He's dad's all star player. And Robby came the year before, but asthma keeps him from playing on the team. And our little Will, he just had his 8th anniversary with us last Christmas. He was lame. I mean they wrote him up in the paper like he was some star, when all he threw were interceptions. He had his comeuppance. You're looking at his comeuppance right here. Regina made these mashed potatoes. Regina made these? Mm-hmm. It's Mrs. Power's recipe. Good night, honey. Good night. Thank you. (click) Regina: I miss Miss Kerr so much my heart hurt, but the coach and his wife were good people and were willing to give me a chance. It might have worked, except for one thing... Oh! (silenced screams) Shh-shh, shh-shh. Open your legs, open your legs. Shh-shh. I'm gonna give you a cooling down. (smack) What the hell?! Woo. (birdsong) (♪♪♪) (telephone ringing) Hello. Jeanne, have you heard from Regina? For? If you hear from Regina, call me immediately. What happened? She's runaway yet again. This time after battering the son of a foster family. Oh, where is she? What's her address in Richmond? This is not your business, Jeanne. Juvenile delinquency is a matter for the police. (dial tone) Please be safe, please be safe. Oh, baby, oh, oh! (sobbing) It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. (sobbing) It's okay. Oh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Mom, I want to adopt Regina. Pumpkin, I knew that at Christmas. Oh, I'm so happy for you, sweetie. I love you. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Where have you been? How was I supposed to know you didn't get in a car wreck or something? Oh, no, sweetheart, I am so sorry. I'm sorry, I have been looking at apartments. I have been looking at some private schools. School? Mm-hmm. What are you looking at schools for? For you. How would you feel about being adopted... by me? How would you feel about being my daughter? Me? (tears of joy) Oh. (♪♪♪) Gonna be manipulated by a child who has survived by manipulation. Do you not believe that boy tried to rape her? That's not the question. The problem here is that Regina Louise has sabotaged numerous foster care placements. Now, I don't doubt your good intentions, but what the girl needs is behavioural correction. She doesn't need you. What she needs is a loving home. I want to adopt her. If you pursue this, I will fire you. I turn in my notice. I need to find a new job, anyway, so I can have my nights and weekends free to be home with Regina. Are you hearing me? Back off of this. Why? She is one of our neediest cases. I can take care of her. I want to take care of her. A single white mother with a black child is unhealthy. Mm, some of our best foster parents are single mothers. Black mothers for black children, white mothers for white. Regina needs to bond with black adults. She's already confused about who she is. Miss Ford, I'm not the right race, but I am the right mother for her. I can give her love. I can give her security. I can give her an education. I'm not asking for foster care, I am asking for adoption. Is your need more important than her identity? Do you, do you understand that I have to answer to the American Association of Black Social Workers? It is up to me to make sure that our black children do not get stripped of their black identity, their culture, their history. What do you see yourself as, some liberal white woman coming in to save the life of a black child? You think what Regina needs is you? No, what she needs is to bond with all black people in a black community. It's about self-determination and self-preservation. And if this adoption doesn't take, that girl will be alone trying to save herself. Miss Ford, I would do anything for this child. Then stay away from her. Give me an S, give me a T, give me a U, P, I, D. Come on, don't be stupid. Jeanne, I work with these kids, you know that I love them, but taking on a black kid, that is a ball and chain that you don't need. (♪♪♪) I-I'm, I'm sorry, I miss-, I misspoke. (♪♪♪) Jeanne. (♪♪♪) Keep in touch, okay? (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) All rise, case number 127A, Jeanne Kerr versus the Louis Centre for the adoption of Regina Louise. (♪♪♪) Your Honor, this is a list of all of the available two bedroom apartments near St. Mary's middle school. I would like to show them to Regina, so we can decide together where to live. And employment? I understand your work was terminated at Lewis Children's Centre. Yes, your Honor, I am no longer at the shelter, but I am confident I will be employed soon. I have a nursing degree. I've worked steadily since graduation. I'm a hard worker, I'm a good saver, and I am sure that I can provide Regina with a safe, secure, supportive and nurturing home. It would be my greatest honor to be Regina's adoptive mother. Thank you, Miss Kerr. Please be seated. Miss Ford, I understand you oppose this adoption. I do, your Honor. You know me and you know my record. In my professional opinion, Regina has no chance for a future without behavioral correction, which Miss Kerr is incapable of providing. The National Association of Black Social Workers has condemned transracial families. Black children belong with black families, and I trust in this court that it would never condone this particularly insidious form of genocide proposed by Miss Kerr. Miss Kerr, your sincerity and commitment to this child is not in question, but I must weigh heavily the opinion of the child's supervisor. Can I say something? Sit down, Regina. Everyone is working towards your best interest, sit down. I know, but I... Sit down. I deny your petition to adopt Regina Louise on the grounds that a white woman cannot know or fully appreciate the needs of a black child in our society. Upon the request of Miss Ford, Regina will be transferred to Redding, California, where she can receive medical treatment for behavior problems, which if not adequately treated now, could lead to more serious sociopathic behaviors in adulthood. (♪♪♪) We're adjourned. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) They think something's wrong with me. They said I have to get better before I can be with you? They're taking you to Riverway's tomorrow. Miss Ford says it's a nice place. And then I could come and live with you? (♪♪♪) You are going to make good friends where you're going. I want you to confide in your counsellors, okay. Let them know how you feel. Let them be your friends. And every night, I want you to ask yourself if you've done your best that day. Ask yourself what nice thing you've done for someone else that day. You are very good at this. It's one of your special qualities, sweetheart. (♪♪♪) You are always in my heart. Remember that. (♪♪♪) I believe in you. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) No, no, no, no! (bang) (♪♪♪) (door buzzer) We're the first children's centre with in-house psychiatric assessment, nurses and classrooms. Residents have full use of the rec room and the pool. This is a palace compared to juvenile detention. You should be counting your blessings. Where are all the kids? At seven they get their treatment. And I'll be back next month to check on her progress. Miss Ford, I'm here a whole month? You're here as long as I say you are. Regina! Regina, stop it! (♪♪♪) I need to talk to my mama! Your mother made you a ward of the state. My mother is Miss Kerr and I need to talk to her now! She is not your mother. Now, I have put you here in the lap of luxury instead of juvenile hall. Pull yourself together, child. Get off of me! (banging) Easy, easy, you'll get the help you need here, Regina. You're lying! You lied to me! You're all lying! Are you feeling sad? Are you feeling angry? It's safe to talk about your feelings here. I want to talk to Miss Kerr. In the adjustment phase, it's best if residents don't make or receive phone calls. You can write Miss Kerr. You can write her every day if you want. I'm here to help you get what you need, and the more you tell me about yourself, the more help I can be. How do you feel about Miss Ford? I hate Miss Ford! Uh-huh. I just want to be somebody's someone. You what? Miss Kerr wants to be a mama to me. On a scale of one to ten, just how angry would you say you feel? (♪♪♪) (door buzzer) (♪♪♪) Miss Kerr. Yes. I'm Dr. Rice. You'd like to see Regina Louise. Yes, I would. I haven't been able to get through by phone, and I just need to know how she's doing. I also understand you told the receptionist that you're her counsellor. Yes. But that's not true, is it? I was her counsellor. Mrs. Ford told us you were fired from that position. It concerns us that you persist in trying to contact Regina. I'm her closest friend. I need her to know that I'm here for her. Well, we'll let her know that. In the meantime, we need you to desist from calling or coming here. Do we understand? (♪♪♪) You think you know, but you don't know, they know. And even if you don't care, they care. Delores. (♪♪♪) Mm-hmm. Regina Louise. I can't stop shaking. Your shaking will stop once your body gets used to the medicine. (♪♪♪) Mm-hmm. Who are you writing? My mother. You call your mom a Miss Kare? Miss Kerr. I call my mom a mama. You want to see her picture? This is her purple, this is her canary, and this is her cranberry. That's her. Don't touch it! (gagging) You about to puke? Those pills don't make me feel good. The most important thing is that they don't make you feel all angry all the time. You can't be nice, you better think twice. They give you red stars if you act up? They take you downstairs. You don't want to go down there. They put cigarettes out on you. She's just poking your eyes. Don't lie, okay. You can't help it, but don't lie. Okay, cool, D. Just don't upset her. PS - Please send me a photo of yourself. (♪♪♪) You see how much better you do when you're in the right place? You see it? I see it. When Regina entered Riverways, she was prone to violent outbursts and self-destructive behaviour. After 30 days of treatment, she has become a model of success. Do you hear that? A model of success, that's my gold star, girl. When can I talk to Miss Kerr? Well if you can get through the next 30 days without trouble, you can have phone privileges. (♪♪♪) How come your calendar is backwards? I want to count the days off, not up. You're a genius. My mom's out of jail in 2 years, that's 368 days times two, is two times eight is sixteen, is a six and carry the one. There's 365 days in a year. That's what I said. (♪♪♪) Mm-hmm. (♪♪♪) The colored girl's sick, somebody help! The colored girl's sick, somebody help! (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (footsteps) (door slamming shut) (door buzzer) I'm sorry, Miss, you're not permitted to be down here. I'm Jeanne Kerr, here to see Regina Louise. I'm her friend. Miss Kerr, I need to speak to you outside, please. (door buzzer) Why, why do this, a restraining order? Your petition for adoption was denied. Dr. Rice has told me that you have repeatedly tried to contact Regina. I just need to know that Regina is all right. Regina's behaviour hasn't been better. Then why won't they let me speak to her? Why hasn't she answered a single letter? Have you ever considered that Regina doesn't want to be in contact with you? Look... Annie McKay told me that your mother passed away two weeks ago, which helps explain this behavior. You need to know that you're way out of bounds, you need to, you need to pull yourself together. I can't believe you're doing this. Don't turn this back on me, Jeanne. This is your obsession, this is your illness. If you really care about that girl, you will sever the bond for good. That's the truth. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) What happens when you get to one? I get to talk to my mother. Regina doesn't have a mother. She's a ward of the state. I have a mother. (distorted recording playing) Regina's mom is a man. No wonder she don't have a picture of her mama. Shut up, don't be mean. (distorted recording playing) What are you doing in D's box? Nothing. Don't touch D's box. I ain't touch it! I forgot my box. She was in your box. (screaming) Regina! Regina! Hey, hey, hey, hey, what is going on? She took her, she took her! Regina took my mother! Calm down, what happened? Regina stole D's picture of her mother out of her box. Where is the picture, Regina? Regina, I asked you a question. I didn't take it, I just wanted to look at it. For stealing another resident's property, you're facing three months probation. I'll tear it up if you don't let me talk to my mama! I mean it, I'll tear it! Regina, Regina, calm down. Give me the photo. No, no, no! This is it, it's over, come on. No, no, no! No, no, please, no, no, please, no! I hate you! Let me go! I hope you die! Sorry, Delores, I didn't mean to hurt your picture! Please, please, let me down! Stop it! No, no, no, no, no! No, you let me out of here! You call my mom and tell her what you've done to me! (slam) (♪♪♪) I can't leave yet. It's been a year. It's time to move on. We have to go, come on. Come on. You have accomplished nothing by your destructive behavior. This file, this history of trouble will follow you for the rest of your life. I pulled strings to get you in here, and believe me, this is a cake walk compared to the psych ward at the state hospital. So, what are you gonna do? How are you gonna turn all this around? I'll go to college. Oh, I see, where will you get money for college? I'll get a scholarship. For what, a scholarship for what? You're already three years behind in school. It's time you took a long hard look at yourself and start to set some realistic goals, Regina. Look at myself? What do you see when you look at me? You see something not worth loving. You can't stand the sight of me. Miss Kerr is the only person that loves me. Miss Kerr left the country. She married a foreign man, who I am sure does not want a black child. That's the world works, Regina. (♪♪♪) Does somebody put it in the wrong box or hid it or lost it? This is the only place it would be. Is there a problem, Regina? I have a letter from Miss Kerr somewhere. She wouldn't leave without writing me first. I'm sorry, Regina, there's nothing in the box. No, look again. I'm sorry. (♪♪♪) (recorder clicking) (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (spit) That's nasty, D. Don't you get your spit on me. (spit) (♪♪♪) Mm-hmm. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Have you seen Regina? (♪♪♪) Hey, where's Regina? (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (splash) Come on, hurry, hurry, come on, get her out of there! (♪♪♪) Tilt her head back. Pass me her robe! Tilt her head back! Oh, Regina! No pulse! Don't do this to me! Come on, Regina! Come on, Regina! She listens to this for comfort. Come on, Regina! Regina! Recording: Hey Pumpkin. Hi, pretty girl. Today's our day! Today is indeed our day. What do you call me? Pumpkin. (laughing) You're crazy. (laughing) Today, we are making a cake. (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) You want to say anything? Whether I talk or not, you write things down. This is your history. Can I read my file? Your file is confidential. That's how we understand you. Maybe I don't like the way you're telling my story, Dr. Rice. Regina, I'm glad you're feeling better. What's that? Well, you were cheeking the pills, so you'll take a liquid dose. I want to see you drink it down. Drink it down. I almost lost my job because of what you did. Now drink it! You drink it. (splash) Ah! (knocking) Guard! May I have a piece of paper and a pencil, please? No sharp objects. I'll take a crayon, that'll do. Do you have a better colour than this? There are 64 colours in a box and all you have is raw sienna? (♪♪♪) Regina: I pulled her words up from my heart where they were stored for safekeeping. The story of me being able to do anything I put my mind to, the story of me someday going to college, the story of me making my dreams come true. (♪♪♪) A, abacus, abandon, abandoned, abapical, opposite from apex. What's an apex? (♪♪♪) Dr. Rice, I want to go to high school and get a job. Why do you want a job? So, I can save money for college. Regina, one of our goals is to get you to think realistically about yourself. You're already three grade levels behind other girls your age. Yes, that's why I have no time to waste. I want to attend a high school, not the classes here. But you haven't earned out privileges. How do I do that? That's up to you. Regina: For 180 days I did everything I was told, except take the meds in the Dixie cup. To keep myself from going crazy, I learned every word in the first 642 pages of the dictionary. By the time I reached the K's, I had won my out privileges. Kinetics, noun, the study of all aspects of motion. (♪♪♪) (typewriter keys clicking) (♪♪♪) If you're gonna do it, do it right, get under the baseboard, baby. Yes, ma'am. (♪♪♪) Mmm, there it is. You got this. (♪♪♪) Ms. Lewis is great. These are gonna look fantastic. I'm gonna own my own hair salon one day, and do hair for all the stars. (♪♪♪) (school bell ringing) (♪♪♪) Miss Lewis, something really good happened to me today. I'm going to college! San Francisco State is giving me a full scholarship to school. That's good, baby. That's real good. Thank you. (♪♪♪) Sign and date here and here. This confirms you're now an adult and the center has no responsibility or liability for you. And this confirms that you've claimed all of your personal belongings. Oh, that's it, you're sending me out with nowhere to go, no money? The center's responsibility to you is over. I want my files. Before I sign this, I want my files. Your files, the property of the center. It's my file. You're not understanding. No, you're not understanding. You can't dope me up and put me in a box anymore, so I'll be a pain in the ass until I get my file, it's my history, then I'll sign this release for you. Medical records and psychiatric assessments are confidential and remain in the center. But you may have your letters. Sign please. (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Recording: Sweetheart, they wouldn't allow me to see you or call, so I'm sending you this message. (♪♪♪) (sobbing) Pumpkin, I know you must be busy making new friends and settling into your new home. Everything changes so very quickly at your age. If you have a moment, I'd be so happy to know how you are. (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (♪♪♪) Recording: Happy birthday, dear heart! May your next journey around the sun be your happiest ever. (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (♪♪♪) Recording: Hi Pumpkin, my mother died this morning. Feels unreal to say those words. I'm so glad she had the chance to meet you and to know how wonderful you are. (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (♪♪♪) Recording: Sweetheart, there have been some big changes in my life, which I'll tell you about when I see you, but I want you to know this will never change. (Sobbing) I hold you in my heart. You are in prayers each and every day. Love, Jeanne. (♪♪♪) (sobbing) (door key click) How did you get in here? I was emancipated yesterday. I didn't have anywhere to go, so I climbed through the window. I'm sorry. Such an outrage. Dumping kids out of the system with nowhere to go, oh god. Here's a key. Sleep here until you find some place. (♪♪♪) Hi Regina. Here's your welcoming packet. Thank you. And here's your key. Thank you. You're welcome. (♪♪♪) You go to the bank and say, "I want a loan to start a small business." The bank will ask for what? A plan. Yes, the banker will ask for a business plan. What are the components of a business plan? (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (typewrtier keys clicking) Regina: With God's grace and 20 years of hard work, my dreams came true bigger and brighter than I ever imagined. I had yearned for a mother as I made my way in the world. Now, I longed for her to share my victories. (♪♪♪) In my need to find Jeanne, I wrote a book about my childhood. It was my hope that she would read it and we would find each other. Gina, I'll need some photographs from your childhood for the book cover. I don't have any photographs. Just a few will do. I don't have any. Who took photos of you when you were a kid? No one was ever round long enough to take my picture. No problem. I'll come up with a different concept. (♪♪♪) Regina: Every night before bed, I continued my search for her. This is a national broadcast? It's as big as it gets. And rolling. Regina: Now as I publicized the book, I hoped she would find me. There's not a day that goes by that I don't get up and put my feet on the floor and hope that she'll come back into my life. (♪♪♪) All these years I had kept Jeanne in my heart, like a mama whispering, I love you, baby, into her child's ear when it was needed the most. No matter what, there would always be something or someone for everybody, for all of us who have been told that we are unworthy. We will give ourselves merciful favor, while standing in the blistering heat of that primal wound. We will wipe away from our consciousness someone else's fatalistic narrative of what our life will be, handed back to the disbeliever and say, "I believe this belongs to you." Thank you. (applause) Thank you. Hi, Bonnie, Bonnie. You take care, Bonnie. Name? Jeanne. (gasp) I'm so proud of you. (♪♪♪) Oh my. (♪♪♪) Ohhh. (♪♪♪) I saw you on TV and couldn't believe my eyes. Oh. My birthday. My goodness, look at that, I remember that shirt. You darling girl. And the cake. (laughs) Oh. My beautiful little girl. You have grown into a beautiful, amazing woman. (♪♪♪) Oh! Oh, my goodness! (laughs) (♪♪♪) Do you, Jeanne Kerr, take Regina Louise to be your daughter? To love, to hold and to cherish and to support financially and emotionally in her future endeavors no matter what they may be? I do. Regina: Everybody wants to be somebody's someone, and today I was. (♪♪♪) ♪♪ Love is when you do the things you say that you will do. ♪ ♪ I give my heart to you. ♪♪ I knew I was going to find her. I knew that one day I would just say thank you for loving me when no one else did. I just didn't prepare myself for her saying I'm gonna make you my daughter, so I got a two for, I got a two for, I got to say thank you and I get to be her daughter, so. You are my daughter. See. (laughing)
