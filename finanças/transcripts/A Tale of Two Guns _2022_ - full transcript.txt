You awake? Well, I guess we better keep moving. Hey, listen to this. She appeared at his door, wearing a Chinese robe and not a stitch more. "Mr. Butler," says she, "I'm in need of your assistance." - Who-hoo. - Hey. Everyone, throw your hands up. McTeague. Yep. This is United States Marshall Terrence McTeague. And all of you are under arrest. They're ain't a rock to hide under, so throw down your firearms and surrender peacefully. You ain't taking us in alive, marshal, we both know that. That you McCloskey? I thought I smelled ya. Look, I don't really wanna make a mess here this morning because I haven't even had my goddamn coffee yet, and that makes me cranky. We heard what you did to our friends back in Tucson. Uh-huh. They didn't come in peacefully. There's only three of them. We got more iron than they do. They got a scatter gun. Ain't no one out running a scatter gun. They got the upper hand on us, gentlemen. There ain't no way I'm goin' out like this, no way. Dan, you hear me? Uh-huh. That's Able Cruz over on the far right. You get my meaning? Yes, sir. Damn marshals. Move in our land. Able, go get the horses. Go on, get yourself outta here. Don't. That's it. That's it. He better run. Oh. Did we get 'em, marshal? We got 'em. We got 'em, Dan. You can't put a coat on with one arm, you stubborn cuss. I tried not to make any noise. It took me an hour and a half to get dressed. I, I didn't wanna wake you, darling. You're about as quiet in the morning as a donkey smackin' away at his jaws with molasses. Okay. There. All dapper and proper. Just like I found ya all those years ago. What is it, Terrence? I'm shot up, Ella. And I just, I just, I can't get moving. I'm just moving slow right now. Well, your best was always better than most men's, far ahead. You feel that you have to do this all on your own? No, no, but I do feel the weight of the responsibility, you know, Ella? And everyone who wears this tin badge bears the same responsibility, deputy or marshal, all the same. The bullets coming at you don't discriminate, Terrence. Ah, Ella, you always knew the right thing to say. Here. Let me, let me do it. Oh yeah, look, well he oughta be here any minute now, I better get ready. You feel this man is right for the task? Ah, who knows? But, he has a reputation. And, that's it. So do you. And a respectable one at that. But the question isn't about his reputation. It is whether you will be able to trust this man to be your right hand. It's going to be okay. Everything's gonna be okay, Terrence. You look fine. Now go on. Do what God made you good at. Go on. Artemis Hollinger? Yes, sir. Terrence McTeague. Why don't we take a seat on the porch out here? They say uh, you don't like horses. To be honest with ya, I don't care much for the creatures myself. But, are you fast with a gun at least? I've never needed to be fast, marshal. Explain. Well, in my experience being fast makes someone less accurate. And in my occupation, less accurate is a death sentence, sir. Hmm. Let me ask you, aside from the money, why do you like this job? Well, it sets a precedent. Uh-huh. And why do you care? I care about the law and the betterment of this country, sir. Uh-huh, what? So did many of the young men that walked alongside of me before. But, what makes you different? Might I ask you a question, marshal? You seem to play against having someone take on this job. Might I ask, why? You think I'm trying to delay this? You think I don't wanna get this job done? I think it might signal an end to an era, sir. Well, yeah. Let me tell ya, I have seen this particular bunch of men, rob, rape, and murder a lotta good people, in the new town particularly, but they have cut deep wounds into this nation, that's still trying to heal. The war between the states, you understand? I have seen lawmen die trying to protect those that can't do unto themselves. And I have stretched the necks of many who didn't believe in justice. Either way, you are right. It is the end of an era. But it will signify the eradication of one of the most dangerous criminal elements in this country. So I asked you again, "Why are you different?" Well, if I'm to be honest, marshal, thrill of the hunt is what I seek. You see, the money allows me to live, and the hunt allows me to move forward. Somethin' I would not expect you to understand, sir. And what happens on the day when there's no more men to hunt? Well then I guess I shall settle myself into somewhat of a normal life, for the tasks that I've been built for will have come to an end. Let me let you in on a little secret. Men like you and me, that normal will never happen. You know, I was just telling my wife inside that you come with uh, quite a reputation. And I, aside from, you know, not liking horses, it's about that little incident that happened up north. And I was thinking perhaps the men who experienced that could tell me about his greatest exploit. You're referring to Tanner Richmond, I assume. I am referring to Tanner Richmond. He murdered three deputies, five civilians, and robbed two banks. If it wasn't speed that killed him, pray tell, Mr. Hollinger, what did do it? Well you see up north is timber country, there are lots of trees. And if you listen very carefully, they can tell you things. Not of the magical nature, sir, what I mean is that you can hear the wind and its changes, and you can hear the snapping of twigs and branches. You see, humans are not the quietest of creatures. Well now, I'll vouch for that. So, it was his escape into those woods which was his undoing, sir. I ain't goin' in alive, Hollinger, you hear me? Tanner, you either run out of bullets or blood. It's all the same to me. Must we keep playing at this game? Or will you surrender? After all, it is gettin' a bit cold out here. Don't make no difference. Like you said, same outcome. If I surrender my neck stretches. At least this way, I go out on my own damn terms. I can respect that. To the death then. To the death. His soul found another place to rest after that. Hm, in the bowels of hell, I imagine. That is a good assumption, indeed. So, it's fortitude. Pardon? Fortitude. You know? I don't know, you might call it uh, doggedness. Like, you're stubborn and hardheaded like an old bloodhound. I do not understand the reference, sir. Well, a bloodhound goes on a hunt and it maintains the scent. Yeah? Well not until my quarry has run aground or taken a bite of the bullet, marshal. Exactly. And that's why you are the perfect man for this job, Mr. Hollinger. Well, if you think it's best, sir. I do, I just, I wanted you to know what the job entails, that's all. Well, it's uh, nothing new, right? It's a basic principle. You find the man, you track the man. Offer him the noose and if he does not accept, kill the man. It's very primal, isn't it? That's the way it should be. You don't want emotion gettin' involved in it. Hm. Could not have said that better myself, sir. What is your uh, weapon of choice, Mr. Hollinger? May I? Huh. Changed the world, this did. Probably the reason we were able to press through the west. You're not a pistol man? Not unless times call for me to be in such close quarters with a man that it might make me feel uncomfortable. Ah, yeah. Yeah I uh, I, I don't know. I'm, I'm, I'm not really able to do my job right now and that feels very frustrating. But that's why I'm happy that a man like you came along, because your quarry is extremely fast. Fast as lightning, and very, very accurate. He could stay on his feet for days. Keep that handy. Why don't we go down to the saloon? There'll be a few questions pointed to one of Abel's old amigos there. Yes sir. Vamanos. And there was five, five men, all with the looks and the reputation that would curl the toes of a cat. Make the hair of a dog stand on its back. They had come to collect ole boy Thaddeus Drake. Were they lawmen? No, my dear, they were gunfighters who wanted the glory of killing me. It was five on one, that ain't fair, right? No. So I says they can each have a turn one at a time. By the time five o'clock rolls around and that bell sounded its fifth ring, all five of them had gone meet the devil hisself. You wanna know what the best part is? Tell us, Thaddeus. I only have five rounds cause I already shot the dog with my sixth. Oh, I heard different. You heard wrong, marshal. No, I heard there was only one man. And I heard that it took you five shots to bring him down. Marshal, I ain't never had much of a problem with you. Even when you done killed my friends, you was just doin' your job. But you're treadin' on some dangerous ground if you're trying to soil my reputation. Everyone has one of those. I'm sorry, sir. Who the hell are you? And I heard that that gunfight was in Texas. Mm, Amarillo, I believe. Ain't that right, Thaddeus? Wasn't that it? Look here. I need information from you. I need to know the whereabouts of Able Cruz. And I would bet my last dollar that you have seen him, or at least supplied him, within the last week. I take your silence as an act of admission. Now, I know you rode for decades with the Cowboys and all that, but uh, until you decided to gamble your life away on those tarot cards. But everybody here in Cochise County knows that you are still in close contact with the old brethren. Marshal asked you a question, Thaddeus. I do not like your face, sir. Therefore, I will feel no such way about killing you on the merit that you are an annoyance in my presence. And I do not see a badge on your person. Hm, I wish to do you harm. Is it a duel you want? A duel? I think it best. Then marshal, with your permission, I shall see this man outside then. You have it. Any of you fellows in the company of his man? Now, should I have any concerns as to threats against my person or my colleague's? Thank you. Thaddeus, after you. That's your colleague, not a marshal. And you ain't gonna arrest me when I put his dick in the dirt. I give you my word on it. See ladies, men, they're always trying to find their fame. This'll be quick. And then the three of us'll find some sheets to ruffle. You ain't really planning on using that, are you? I'd feel horrible killing a man with a weapon as slow as such. You just mind your iron. Suit yourself, stranger. Say when. Excuse me. Thaddeus, where is Able Cruz? Where? He's going to Contention to buy land. Well, figure that one out. Look, just burn him out. Get rid of his dying breed of bastards. Promise me that. Be relentless, or the crows and the wolves in this world will take your place, understand? All right. Good luck and Godspeed. Go on, go make history. Couldn't wait much longer, I'm afraid. Afraid? They've sent someone. A professional. Left Tucson over a week ago. If I waited any longer, there wouldn't be any chance that I might collect the reward. I'm afraid you have me mistaken for someone else. No. No, you wear that red sash real proud. There ain't no mistakin' who you are, mister. How long you been following me? For awhile. Why didn't you just shoot me while I was sleeping? I've been afraid. That makes good sense. The times are hard. Times are hard. But they ain't worth dying for. I guess I'd rather risk that than not risk it at all. I got mouths to feed. Those mouths won't be able to feed themselves if you're dead, friend. And there're plenty of men like you, all met their fate too soon. And that was their job. You doin' this for a bit of coin? Feed your family. You're worth a lot more than that, mister. Greed don't wear well on you. Hey. Boy. Now you can bet your ass they're gonna be keeping an eye on that road to Bisbee. We should go Old Mexico. Old Mexico ain't that old. It's old. In what context would you consider it old? It's in the title, Old Mexico. Now that passage north'll be your better bet. But then again, you go that route, you're gonna have those boys from back east - on your ass. - Pinkertons. Yeah, those sons of bitches are everywhere. So, where're you guys headed to? Well, wherever it's hard to find the law, that's where you'll find us. Old Mexico. Come on now, Junior. Mexico ain't the answer to all your problems, besides we can't even get to that goddamn place. What about you? What are you thinking? Best investment I can think of is staying right here in Arizona. Investment? Man owns land, he has options. Well land ain't cheap. I know where there's cheap land. I swear to God, Junior, you mention old Mexico one more time and I'm gonna shoot you myself. McCloskey's got a place near Tucson. It's on the way to where I'm headed. Now that, that's one one dangerous path to take. That's McTeague's territory. You go there, he's gonna be on your ass night and day. So which direction are you guys goin'? - South. - North. We're goin' north. Gonna give Colorado a try. That's a safe bet. Yeah. Got good farming land, good hunting land. And you got all those people from back east, goin' west, chasing their American dream, carrying all that money. And we can take all that money. You stay safe, Bill. Ah, you too. Thank you. Now listen here, you find yourself a nice little patch of land that you can call home, you make sure you find us. All right, will do. Alrighty. What? Don't shoot him, Junior. I can't make that promise, but you stay safe, okay? All right. I'm sorry! Stupid, stupid man. Children. Come on, now. You a thief? I reckon you might be a thief. I'm not. A rustler? No. Bounty hunter then? Oh, a law man. Who you after? I can assure you that your likeness does not match the man whom I seek. If you are indeed a wanted man, it is not me who has come to seek you out. Well I ain't no wanted man. This here's my property. What is? All of it. Runs from the crook in the river all the way to Hell's Canyon. Roughly about 1,200 acre. That's a lotta land, especially for... Indeed, it is. And I can't say I didn't earn every inch. Now, if the moment would allow it, why don't you talk to me for bit. I had a traveler come through these parts the other day. Asked me if I lost a horse. I told him no. Asked him why he was asking. Said the horse was grazing and went full attack on him, out yonder near the river. So, I wandered out, and I took a looksie. And there it was. I don't mean to be rude, sir, but why are you telling me this? Several days back, friend of my wife's came and asked if we'd seen her husband. Said he's been missing for a few days. Family fell on hard times. They're a struggling bunch. They looked out for us when we came out, even after the war and all. I found that man this morning, shot full of holes. Man you looking for a murderer? He's done his fair share of it. Cold-blooded killer? Or the type that gets wrongly accused in a gunfight? Cowboy. Ah, he wears red. Yes he does. Why do you suspect he's in this part of the county? It's not this part of the county, on your property, I believe. Oh, and you have that on good authority? Back at Rennley Station, marshal and I asked a few questions to a particular associate of said man. Said he asked where the quickest way through the Diablo was. Trail runs right through this way through your property. Hm. Many people travel through here? Nope. If it is of any concern, well, the odds of him coming up against another traveler, it's just a little slim out here. Me and the men that are in my employ, they do a good job of keeping watch. There's camps posted out all over the property. You have men on your employ? Damn straight. I worked hard for this. I ain't gonna let anyone take my freedom away again. Which way might he head? Well, aren't you a good tracker? Must be if you're out here. Judging by where I found the body, I'd say he's following the river. Now the river will lead him into the town of Contention. Now, if he makes it there, he will surely run into trappers, traders, miners, people such as that. A lotta nefarious folk there. Logical? That's correct. Well, you head west several miles, you'll run right into it. Any other ranches along the river? Nah, not one close by. But if he travels by river, or steals another horse, well then, several days of travel downstream will put him at Fort Minick. It's a trading post, soldiers' barracks. Now there is a small soldiering post in Contention. Oh, I think he'd stay away from the fort. Contention is as good as guess as where he might be headed. Another one thing, deputy. We've been having a lot of Apache problems out here. Same with rustlers and bandits. I've had two ranch hands killed, and several herd of cattle stolen. So you be careful on that journey now, sir. Even in that town. Thank you. You see that man gets what he deserves. That family was left with nothing, because of him. Whoa, whoa. Let's get you a little shade, a little rest. All right? Come on. Brave man. Looks like the Apache didn't take a liking to ya. Is there a doctor in this town? Around the corner. You can leave your things here. Be safe until you return. Or you can take your horse up to the livery, cost you a couple extra coins. Gonna need you to take off your shirt and the like, mister. Is your money good? We're all running from something. I suppose everyone needs second chances and new beginnings. Let's get you fixed up. You're gonna wanna bite down on this. You're a lucky son of a bitch, you know? Here you go. So, you here looking for mining work or for land. Well, which one is it? Land. Tough place, especially for the ranchers. I welcome less people. Should've welcomed less arrows. You don't say? Well, the Injun problem seems to be gettin' under control, these parts, at least. Or at least that's what the Army wants us to be believing. What makes it dangerous then? We do. Drink. Bite. Bite. All right. Take your good hand, apply pressure. I'm gonna suggest that you change these daily so they don't infect. I'm gonna give you some salts. That'll help heal 'em quicker. Keep 'em wrapped clean, you hear? Thank you, doc. Don't mention it. You're a very kind woman. Men like me, we ain't used to that. I hope I can see you around here. Well, you know where I am now. Yes, I do. Come in. Artemis Hollinger, sir. Captain Matthias Granger. How can I help you? I was wondering if a stranger came through here. You know, we know see many law men in these parts. - Really? - Yeah. It's like they expect us Army folk to do their jobs for them. So you being out here, you have earned my respect. So, has a stranger come through here? Strangers always come through here. That's who I sell land to. Apache land, correct? The land I sell is owned by the U.S. government, purchased by President Thomas Jefferson. Well captain, it was indeed theirs before it was ours. Was it not? If someone arrived and set up camp on my home, raped my women and pillaged my cupboards, I too would surely scalp those individuals. Well, you're clearly not from these parts. Well then I guess we agree to disagree. Mm, yeah. Since we agree to disagree, I would hope that you would honor your code as I do mine, and you would help me by giving me any information that you might have that would help me find the individual who I'm on the hunt for. Man came in yesterday, purchased a parcel. Okay now, what features do you want on your parcel? Anything with water nearby would be preferable. Okay, then this is perfect. Right here. 600 acres, southeast corner, borders a river that my scouts tell me is stocked with fish. There's also timber, pine and the like, and it's only half a day's ride from town. This is an exceptional piece of land, if I may say so myself. Why has no one bought it yet? Well, many people don't survive the trip out west. I think the Apache might have something to do with that. How many ranchers are currently in this area? Well, I don't wanna lie to ya. You'd be the first. But, a man with proper trust in the U.S. Army, a man who knows his way around a long rifle, a man who hires ranch hands that also know their way around a long rifle, a man who can defend his own property, this man becomes a prominent rancher. How much? Well, it's $5 an acre, 600 acres. That's $3,000. Might you be interested in a horse? I might be. Well there's a livery next door. They'll get you outfitted. Let's get you started on that paperwork, shall we? Okay, let's see. Your John Hancock. Congratulations. Proud owner, lot 17. Thank you, captain. You're very welcome. Was he wearing a red sash? Is that important? Yes, it is. I'm sorry, but I don't know. He was wounded, so he went to see the doctor before he came here. Her name's Henninger, you might wanna talk with her. Doctor? Yeah, he had a run-in with Apache. You think that's funny? No, captain. I've just been hunting this man for a few weeks now, and every time I think I might understand him, he, he does something to surprise me. Yeah, sounds like a dangerous fella. Yes, it does. Would you happen to have a copy of his purchase agreement on hand? Is that the man you're looking for? Indeed. Captain, if you'd be so kind, I'm gonna need directions on how get to that man's recently purchased parcel. Okay, well, if you go over to the saloon and have yourself a steak, by the time you finish, I'll have everything you need. Appreciate that, sir. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Remind me after I take all these fools' money to have a go with you later, honey. That a promise, Ben? You can bet your ass on it, sweetheart. I just need one. Man who don't talk much can make a table full of card players mighty nervous. Gonna sit there and gawk all day, mister, or actually play the game? You got some balls, friend. You fancy yourself a good card player? I just like the game, is all. Skilled or not, it relaxes me. No one just likes the game. Everyone is in this to make money, mister. Oh, you saying you don't like making money? I like money just fine. The thrill of the game, the excitement of decision, that's why I play. Wouldn't you agree, gentlemen? Excitement? Excitement is something you get when another man draws down on you, and you're steering cold hard steel directly in the face. Game of cards, just a game of cards. Whiskey, please. Your bet, Ben. $2. Feeling lucky. Too rich for my blood. That's a lotta paper I'm holdin'. I'll call. Goddamn right you will. Still got one more barrel to shoot there. We still talking about cards? Better watch your tone, friend. I was just saying, you get one more draw on these cards to beat this here hand that I got, because make no mistake, it is a winning hand. That's what I was saying. The excitement of the decision, with everything on the line. That's why I love to play this game. Well then Chauncey, I guess there's no reason to deal another card. The man is fine with his hand. True, but there should be another round of betting. It is tradition to the game. Correct. $5. You can't afford it, you could always fold. You know, Ben, I believe he purchased one of the largest parcels in the area. Well, I can afford it just fine. Besides, I've never folded on a winning hand. A winning hand, he says. What makes you so sure you have a winning combination of cards there? You did not ask for another card either, which would have a normal man think that you're playing one of several hands. A flush, a straight, full house, or four of a kind. Now with four of a kind, you'd still draw another card to throw your opponents off to what you already had. At least, a normal player might do that. Nah, you don't seem like the kind that would wanna win with a sprawling hand of mixed numbers with only a matching symbol. No. You like a rock-solid hand. Either be a straight or a full house. And I bet you're probably sitting on a full house. Your arrogance does a good job of proclaiming that. Shall we up the bet? That's the rest of my money, and I still need supplies to start getting my new property in line. Hell I haven't even visited it yet. I'm willing to wager the rest of my sum because you don't seem like a man who would back down from a bet. Sure are talking a lot now. In my experience, someone in a hand starts running their mouth, means they're trying to talk their way outta somethin'. I call. Did you cheat me, boy? Gentlemen, you do not wanna do this. I asked you a question! I played a fair game. There was no cheating involved. It was a fair game, I was watching. The man did nothing of a dishonest variety. Who the hell are you? No one of concern. Just someone who does not like being interrupted while he's trying to drink his whiskey in peace. Next one finds you. Now, I believe you owe the man some money. Thank you, sir. I agree. Best you move along now, sir. Someone like me will not be around next time these men decide to try and get the better of you. Gentlemen. That'll be $37. Be careful out there. I said thank you, didn't I? Something else I can do for ya? You can come with me peacefully. Say it again. I'm a peace officer from Tucson and you are a criminal. I ask that you come with me peacefully as to avoid any bloodshed. More importantly, so I don't have to drag your body through miles and miles of hard terrain. The stink on you alone is gonna attract every wolf, mountain cat, and fly for over a hundred miles. You came all the way out here just for me? That is correct. Why didn't you just shoot me in the saloon? I wanted to give you a chance to surrender. That was a mistake. What was a mistake was killing a man a ways back. That was self-defense. That's what all your kind say. He wanted a bounty. Rightfully so. Most men would be on the look for ya. So, what is it to be? I will not be taken in alive. Why you still wear that? It is a brotherhood. Time of the Cowboys has come to an end. I do not wish to kill you. I wish there was a more peaceful way to this solution. Either way, it ends with me being dead. Do not make me kill you. Deputy. Call me Artemis. Where do we go from here? We both ride back to Tucson. Hell of a journey. Lotta land to cover. If you run, I'll shoot you. Fair enough. So what was your plan anyhow? I saved up everything I had. No, you stole everything you had. Some of it. To what end? Land. Around here would've been a new start for me. Away from the law, and life that had been so violent. Even a murder is a choice. Ain't never killed anyone who didn't deserve it. You killed a deputy a bit back, he didn't deserve it. McTeague and his deputies ambushed us, they were shooting and killed my brothers. Like I told ya, it's a brotherhood. What do you think this is? Just a piece of tin? It's a moral code, and those who wear it and abide by, those are brothers. Half the men that ever donned that tin star have found themselves thievin' and cattle rustling, or committing murder. Hickok was wanted for the murder of a man down in Abilene. The Kid, deputized, and then sought after by his own government. No, in this land, you're one quick draw away from either being a lawman, or an outlaw. What happens, deputy, if you ever make a mistake and you find yourself wanted for murder? I do not make mistakes. Pride is the greatest mistake we ever make. So, land, you came and bought it. I was gonna try my hand at ranching. Proper. Dangerous in these parts. So I've been told. What do you know of it, other than stealing cattle and horses? Only from crooked ranchers and cattle barons. Get up. Doesn't chasing down men like me get tiresome? It does. Well, why not try something else? No other occupation would have me. Well, a man can change. Don't you ever get tired and wanna put down the gun? Some day. Some day there may no longer be a need for men like me. Some day. Some day. You saved my life. You'd have done the same for me. I don't think I would have. You didn't shoot me in the saloon. You had honor. You waited till I was alone to arrest me. You seem like a good man. Some men's pride gets the better of 'em. Your sash, give it to me. I will not ask again. You died here today. Get it? Your belief in this brotherhood, your criminal ways, everything you once stood for dies here, right now. Now go. Go, before I change my mind. How much was I worth? Hundred dollars. Thank you, Artemis. Ah, Artemis Hollinger. Praise the Lord. Uh, please, come in. Uh, I uh, only wanna make this brief, marshal, I have a stage to catch in 10 minutes. Oh, uh, you have another job? Back up in Oregon country. Oh. Good. The organization known as the Cowboys has come to an end. You will no longer find another red sash on anyone ever again. Well, what about Abel Cruz? His reputation is dead, sir. Oh, thank God. And thank God you're, you're safe and sound and back in one piece. Come on, let's walk down to my office and we'll fetch that hundred dollar bounty I owe you. I do not want your currency, sir. It turns out the hunt was all that I needed. Our time has ended, marshal. And now we must figure out what men like us are gonna do in this life. Good-bye, marshal.
