BULGARIAN CINEMATOGRAPHY BOYANA FILM STUDIOS CREATIVE COLLECTIVE "HEMUS" THE SWIMMING POOL screenplay HRISTO GANEV script editor SVOBODA BACHVAROVA cinematography by IVAYLO TRENCHEV original music by SIMEON PIRONKOV sound mixer METODI SHTEREV production design by MARY-TEREZ GOSPODINOVA starring: KOSTA TSONEV YANINA KASHEVA KLIMENT DENCHEV directed by BINKA ZHELYASKOVA Did you say something, mother? - No. You wanted to say... For the sleepless nights, when hardship and doubts were still before them. When the feat was in the making and the entire collective was facing the dilemma Who will prevail in this uneven battle - the steel or the man? The answer is clear for us, already. And let's wave good-bye with thankfulness the past and talk from the heart, plain and humanly for one, I would say, rare guest on the harsh weather-beaten faces, furrowed from the trouble of the daily grind. Let's talk about... the smile. The smile - this open window for the human soul will give us the waft of a new conception of the world, new self-esteem and pride, so inherent to the youth, the enthusiasm and the creative impetus of our working class. Good evening. - Good evening. Are you Bela Belcheva? - Yes, I am. Telegram from Morocco. Good luck! Thank you. - Mum, give the man a treat! ...opens new doors, unfolds unexpected potential powers. Calls out the inspiration and the faith in the happiness. Let's not get confused by the powerful and beautiful words. Because these silent and humble workers live, work and create just like us, even better. Because of this "even better", we tried to tell you today. About it's values and dimensions and this almost unnoticeable stroke in the portrait of a man which distinguish him from another, Comrade Kiradzhiev, it'll be interesting for our viewers to hear from you something more about the complex, but interesting path, which your brigade went through, before becoming front-rankers. The path we went... There were a lot of hardships. But you went through them!? - Yes, we did. Some of the guys were afraid, they ran away... Young and inexperienced, but you the hardened builder gave them a hand? Yes, I gave them a hand. We thought that we won't succeed, in the beginning. Every beginning is difficult. But everything is ok in the end, if it's not ok - it's not the end, isn't it? From your father? - Yes. Dear Bela, I kiss you and I greet you. Happy farewell ball in school and good luck in life! Daddy. It's time to say good bye now. Every parting casts a gloom, but it gives us hope, too that in the near future we'll have new, even more joyful reason for a meeting with our new friends, heroes of "Profiles from tomorrow". The interview was taken by the editor Dora Belcheva. Hello, Mishevi?! Excuse me, it's Bela's mother calling. Yes, Bela Belcheva - Misho's classmate. She... Yes, yes... Bela, what are you doing? No, he's not here yet. It's more than an hour now. One hour and forty-eight minutes. - Hour and a half. Almost two hours. He promised her to take her. What misunderstanding!? We wait. We worry. It's me. It's me. I don't know. I just can't believe that it happened. But it's not so late. Thank you. What else should I say - parents, relatives... wasting time. I felt uneasy and... I forgot. - What?! It's so stupid, but I forgot! I took Anelia, I took Pepa, Mariana also and I forgot, that I have to take you, too. Bravo, you are even honest. The most honest fool on Earth! Should I kiss you! Do I have to kiss you, now?! Bela! - Did you forget Anelia? How could you! You can't forget such ass! What about Pepa and her goggling eyes?! How could you forget me! Am I an umbrella or a glove?! You remember my address. You remember my phone number. But you forget me! I haven't heard such thing to forget about an entire person. Beat it! Are you leaving? I'm entering life! Bye. Uncle Dechko, squat low, like a cavalryman! Straight back, until you sit on your heels. One, two, three. That's right. One... That's it. Bravo! Now more actively. One... Sister Maro, don't twist that waist! Oh, what's the temperature? It's cold. - It's slippery, easy on the ladder! My kids were telling me - go, mother, go. As long as you like it - go! Take it easy! Come on, you are almost swimming. That's right - wave with you hands. - Wow, you do it like a walrus! Come on, swim! Are you going to jump? They will fine you! Swimming in street clothes is forbidden! - If I jump, It won't be in the pool! Is the situation so hopeless? I know a very interesting game for people who doesn't like to talk. Players talk only with questions. Do you want to try? Is this your way to pick up girls? - Is it old? Is there a newer way? Even if there is, will it suit you? - Do I look so shabby? Then, Why don't jump in the pool and leave me alone?! How could I leave a girl in the middle of the game? You start with the game again? - We are finishing. Don't you notice? Are you going to talk about fluids?! - No, about the questions game. And you thought that it's interesting. Are you from the group for health and longevity, too? I'm alone. I was swimming and maddening one guy who can't. I want to swim! I want kissing. - That's all you think of. Why didn't we take our swimming suits?! Bravo, Mishe. Hygiene is the mother of health. Misho, Misho, Misho! Misho! Misho! Stop him! Do something or I'll throw him off the tower. Or I'll jump! - Wait, Misho... Misho, from the top, from the top! From up there! From up there! From the top! With a turn in the air! It's alright! The young people here are good pedestrians. They follow the signs and the traffic ordinance. I don't have a number on my shirt. It's only for contestants there. - Watch for the dolphins, they are our brothers. If there is a man running on the street, and the people who are chasing him, scream "catch him", will you do it? Is this the questions game again? Imagine that the man is passing you by. All you got to do is stretch your leg and tackle him and they'll get him. He might be a murderer. But he might be chased by murderers as well. What would you decide in that split second? I guess I know what troubles you. Do you always worry about small stuff? I'm not worrying. I think of why did I stop Misho!? I trusted you, not Misho, without knowing who is wrong and who is right. Maybe I stood in the way of something bad or maybe I hindered something good!? A friendship, for example, or a love. The real game of questions, my girl, is like solitaire. A game of solitary person, who asks himself. Without waiting for an answer from anyone. Except from the fate. Jumping with clothes on into the pool is forbidden! Say - Carry cactuses even when you're with your dad. Come on - slow and high - Carry cactuses even when you're with your dad. Strange people indeed - the patients. Make them repeat "33" a hundred times. They will do it until fainting. But if you ask them to repeat something, which they don't know - they say nothing. Well, say - 33. Carry cactuses even when you're with your dad. - She was from the opposite girls. Well, do you feel relief? - What? Did you get away with it? Those words are magical. I made them up. When I'm afraid, or I'm not in a mood, I repeat to myself - "Carry cactuses even when you're with your dad" and I get away with it. Some people count to hundred. Some swear. - Drink. I don't drink. - And you don't jump, but you jumped. Drink, drink, it will warm you, and it gives courage. Where could you go without courage. What's your name? - Bela. Bella! Bella with two "L" means "pretty" in Italian. I'm with only one "L". - Swanky, too! So, with two "L" - pretty, with one "L" - ugly. Listen, Bela with one "L", once I knew two partisan women. One was pretty. The other was ugly. Both were killed. She is stubborn, nothing else. She just has to dry up. Doctor, do you know everything? Well-nigh. I have seen heroes dying of fear. Good fellows killing. Honest people doing unfair things. I met enemy friends and friends enemies. What more... Carry cactuses even when you're with your dad.. I want to leave! The doctor said that you must dry up. You insulted him for no reason. Drink. The alcohol is human's enemy, isn't it?! - Man has many enemies, and they teach him that alcohol is the worst, so he doesn't fight the rest. Just a sip! It's not warming me up. Are you at work here, or you are just swimming? I'm life-guard. I help Harry. He rescues the naked, I - the dressed. And then you twit about it! Then I take them with my car at home. I mean - to their homes, where they live. Or at least to the first laundry. You are terrific! You breaks make noise like a real car. Where are you going? - Come on, get in. Wait, I have to call the squirrel. This is Boyan. An actor and comic impersonator. That's why they call him Bufo, he calls himself like that, too. Like those, that just open their mouth, but you hear the voice of Armstrong. I was walking in the wood, recording nightingales. When suddenly I'm looking under a tree - a squirrel. Good morning, squirrel, I said. Nice to meet you - Mariana, said the squirrel. Well, if it's so nice for you, let's jump together. And then - jump and jump, from one branch to another-here we are. For more details about her personality Mariana will answer the question by herself. This is Bela. - Bela! Bufo and Bela. I love short names. And the woman I almost married was called Stanislava Dobromirova Karasimeonova. While the mayor was telling her name I canceled the wedding. Mariana, but I'll call her Mary. - Mary is vulgar. Then I made up a world class act, but I need a dummy, from the nude, pink ones which they put on the window-displays. Imagine a shop for men's clothes and one such dummy with underwear. A robber is being chased in the shop and he takes off his clothes, in order to hide from the police officer and he stands next to the dummy, in the exact same pose. Bravo, that's really classy! At least a thousand people in the world have used this situation. - It doesn't matter, the classic authors use old plots. My story just begins. In order to find out which one is the real thief the policeman starts tickling them, pinching them, kicking them, slapping them, stab them with knife and here is the twist... Don't forget that this is an act and here is the trick. The real thief doesn't say a word, but the dummy laughs, moans, screams and in the end he fells down on the ground. The policeman leaves and the thief cries next to the body of the innocent dummy. It's not bad, but do you imagine any of our policemen tickling someone, shooting at innocent people, even a dummy. You are right. I'll set it before the war. The robber will be a partisan being chased by the gendarmery. They were animals. Poor partisans, we taught them to be kissed and killed like gangsters to dance on their thumbs. To sing with jazz orchestra. We only haven't impersonated them. I'm here. Stop! Unloading. 664387. - Bye. Bye, Mary. I can find you a dummy. - This can't be true. 664387. I remembered the phone number. I'll give you a call. I've always believed in girls with short names. Bela. Stop, right now! I see a squirrel. Katerinoo. Kate. Mother! Come in, enter. This is my mother. - Belcheva. What happened? Misho's returned all wet. - I'm dry. Were you together? - Together. Come, sit for a while, I'll change my clothes. I began to worry. Bela left a little bit tense. Did she tell you what have happened to her?! Excuse me, but I know you better and from longer time than your daughter. You remain to say that we've spent many nights together. We hear jokes every day. I'm sorry if I ruined your day somehow. I thought that it's impossible. Is that so? Actually you are right. The high spirit is an official duty for me. Line from the labour code. But everyone needs a rest, am I right? Bela, I'm off to work. Won't you tell me what happened? Or at least where were you? - I jumped from the tower at the pool. Nonsense. You can't swim! - But I can jump. Were you drunk? - You know that I don't drink. You smell like brandy. - I drunk brandy later - as a medicine, to warm up and for courage. - I see that you don't want to talk. Just tell me - should I worry or shouldn't I? Don't worry, mum! I'm leaving. I have a reportage. I'm sorry, I'm late! Thank you. I don't know why, but I kind of guess, that you somehow helped my daughter. Good bye. Bela, give the comrade something. My mother told me to give you a treat. You have to accept. I am good daughter. They don't make such door anymore. The old work is obvious. This house is old, isn't it? - From before the war. It's interesting what my mum would serve you - rakia, vodka or whiskey. As for a letter-carrier - one small rakia. I know that drinkers don't like to laugh. My mum will pass out-this was a gift. - Am I drinker? What are you? Can't imagine a... grown-up man wasting his time with unknown girl. How horrible, you read my mind! - This crosses the mind, of everyone I meet. Cheers. Let's consider that we know each other now. - Cheers. I'll drink coffee. Do you know... I think that... if I see you running and I hear "catch him, catch him," and you are passing by me, I won't stretch my leg to tackle you. Well, well! - I'll bring the coffee. Are you alright? - I was thinking something. Did you turn off the light? - Because I spilled the coffee? I turned it off with my elbow. How do you know that the lamp in the kitchen is on during the day? The window is facing a shaft-it's always dark, that's why you keep the lights on. How long have you been living here? - Long time. I was born here. 19 "Pavel Banya" street. - "Malichka" street, same number. And the same street. Weird, on the way in I didn't pay attention to the street, the house, the stairs... Even this living-room didn't suggest. Suddenly I felt. I have been here. I have lived in this apartment many years ago. I have sit in this chair. Impossible. My grand-father have bought it from some Armenians after the war, they were leaving for the Soviet Union. Except if you believe in rebirth. Long, long time ago... - Long time ago, in another era, and there is rebirth too, back then Malichka was a joyful student-a friend of mine Maybe in this building, but in a different apartment. The disposition is the same. The kitchens are identical too. In this room, next to the wall on the left, there is a built-in money-box. My dad used to say that probably the Armenian used to hide his money in it. We are keeping our birth certificates, diplomas and one medal "St.Kiril and Metodii 2nd class". We used to think that there are gold and diamonds, too. We used to convert them in guns, but we found just a few old love letters. Nusha wanted to hide the appeals here. It was naive, of course. The police would look in the money-box first. And then... It's a pity that you glued the carpet. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven spans from that wall, one... five spans from this one - here on that spot. There are two removable boards under which we used to hide the materials. I didn't knew who was the owner of the apartment. The house where I was hiding collapsed in one bombing... I used to sleep where I find. I was in trouble. It was cold outside. Winter. Then I met Nusha. There was a couch on that place, too but it was a lot wider and I found it more luxurious after the sheds and the misery. Nusha had a key for this flat and she brought me here to sleep. I didn't knew Nusha very well, too. They got us together for one campaign, we knew that we are from the Young Communist League and that was all. She used to sleep in the room with the money-box, I used to sleep here. Was she so ugly? I don't believe you and the others. Anyone. You think that we are fools, and you present yourselves as angels. But children were being born, right? In the mountains,the prisons, the police. People were married before being shot. But the dead are silent, and the livings are pretending to be shot, as if they were not human. I don't believe that you were hugging just for the conspiracy, you had desire. You have wanted her. And it wasn't just a play. You have been in love, but you were ashamed of it. You are ashamed now too, because they didn't teach you to be honest. End. Female crying - second take. You are great. You worth more than a funeral. Female laughter - beginning - now laugh. I can't. - What? You can't laugh? I can't. - Come on, Lydia, don't disappoint me. It's so simple. Don't be affected! Listen. It's great, record it. I need real laughter, human, and female. Beginning. Record. - I have never laughed with open mouth. My teeth are not pretty... - I'm not filming, I just record sound. Oh, come on! Lydia, what do you want now? Do you want me to tickle you? Is that what you want? Tell me, do you want to be tickled? Female laughter first take - beginning. End. Female laughter first take. Perfect. - Is that all? What more? Oh, no, my girl, when I work - I work. We are not going to drink, aren't we? - Tonight in the bar, dear Lydia. I told you that we are going to work here. Have I ever refused to buy you a drink? I told you about the teeth, too. Hello, yes. Hello, 664387? - Bufo is on the phone. I'm Bela, do you remember me? I found the dummy. Dummy? Adriana, is it you? - I'm Bela. Bufo and Bela - the short names. - Oh, right, it's a pleasure. Hello. - I found it, you can take it. When? - You can come now if you are free. I'm free as a bird. But I have spleen. What do you have? Ella is singing on my stomach. Ella Fitzgerald, I mean. The radio. Are going to come? - If you tell me where. The shop on "Lege" and "Stamboliiski". You'll find me on the window display. Where, where? - On the window display. You or the dummy? - Me. I'm waiting for you. Come inside. I haven't knew a designer yet but I got lucky today. I thought you are finishing school!? - College. I was on a training here and now I help them ones in a while. I'll bring it in a minute. It's wasted. But the arm can be glued. You can paint it, too? He'll be like brand new, even his father won't recognize him! Am I right, Georges? How will you carry it? I thought that he'll walk. We'll take a taxi. You will come with us, won't you? The window display is great. The display is fine but.. - No, no. You are like mother to Georges and you have to know in what conditions he'll live. Georges, mothers are like that today! They toss you and then they leave you. I'll get a cab. We will wait for you. I hope you appreciate this trust. If I'm not here and you want to see Georges, you can come and unlock. Here we are. Right. In front of the mirror. George is vain. Only the frame is left from the mirror. When I put a sound of a breaking glass it becomes real. What are we going to drink? Every good deal must be celebrated. Your shop got rid of one broken dummy, and I got it for free, so we are all happy. Packthread instead of strings. - When I play a sound of real guitar, it becomes real. So many bottles and not even one is full. - When you fill an empty bottle with vodka - it becomes real full bottle, too. Are you like that as well? Everything here is fake. Except for me. In contrast to other houses, where... Will you answer me something? I keep the truth here. I play it only when I need to. And when I want to. - Georges, let's go home. He is a fascist. - Lock the doors! Entering or leaving during the show is strongly forbidden. Bravo, so you are an actor! I thought that you are pretending! - Don't insult me, I have a diploma, too How much joy for the kids. What are going to do with them? Keepsake from the graduation ball. We decorated the hall and these were left They could be useful for the window display. Was it fun? - Not at all! I didn't go. Why? Do you want to compete. The one who blows bigger balloon wins. What's the prize? - Winners choose. Why didn't you go? - I'm ugly. I wasn't wanted. - By one or everybody? One for all! They are very pretentious. Technical college for art craft, what do you know. I'm sorry, but I won! I thought that that's your wish, squirrel! Bela. And my wish contains two wishes - don't call me squirrel and don't think that I'm squirrel. Well, well, these ugly girls are very perky! At least I don't fool myself I'm pretty, like you pretending to be an actor. Others sing and talk instead of you and you just move your lips and make faces. You don't even have a name, only a phone number, known by all the squirrels - 664387. The real artist must have a name. Chaplin, Cherkasov, Gabin. I want to leave. I want to go home. I'm leaving. End. Crying of a sad donkey. No signal. Is it broken? Party line? - All right, I heard you! Don't squeal! No signal, what do you want me to say, that it's fake? To jeer at me again? Antediluvian monster. There is the real phone call a taxi, call the bus station, call the airport if you want! Just leave! I brought you for fun. To celebrate. I gave you the key for the house... Go on, call! Call a taxi! Go away. And wear your virginity belt. You didn't brought me, I called you! - That's even better. You are worse than the squirrels. When they call they know what they want. I wasn't looking for you. I wanted to see your friend, But he doesn't give around his phone number. Apostol!? Apostol doesn't have a phone. He lives on 11 "Chervena voda" street. I'll call you a cab. - I don't want a cab, I'll take the bus. Second take. Lion roar - start! Should I escort you? - I can go by myself. Circus music number 8. Beginning - first take. Second take. Architect Apostol Panchev "I'm at the pharmacy. I'll be back soon." Are you waiting for the architect? - Yes. He's away? - It says that he'll return soon. He's off to the pharmacy. Did you ring the door-bell? - I haven't, why? He might be inside. This note is from almost a year now, Since his wife left. God bless her. He is strange. You don't seem to be related to him?! - I'm not. What do you sew? - Pants for the cock. You are young and you don't get those things. Are you married? - I'm not. When you get married, when you give birth, you'll see. Babies need everything - new diapers, bed sheets, bootees, handkerchiefs. Man comes from nothing and with nothing. Then man lives, works, piles up and at the end he leaves, like he came - to nowhere and with nothing. And what does the old man need - the same as the baby. New clothes and one white sheet instead of diapers. All right - I'm done. - Are you going on a trip? God knows, but I must be ready. Are you alone? Don't you have someone... - I have son and daughter, grand children, too, but they are too busy. I don't want to bother them. That's his wife's handwriting. She went to the pharmacy and never got back. She fell under a truck. Terrible sight. I didn't go to see her. I can't bear such things. The architect didn't go, as well. He didn't want to see her dead. And poor Nusha... What was her name? - Nusha. I don't know her full name, but he used to call her Nusha. Excuse me, I thought that it's Bufo. Only he harasses the door-bell in such manner. Come in, the coffee will become cold. - I'm sorry, I disappointed you. He just gave me the address. - Bufo? Oh, Bufo and Bela - the short names. My friend is breaking his own records. - I called him. I found a dummy for him. What do you prefer Diana Ross or Lily Ivanova? Something more quiet. There is something more quiet, too. Won't you ask why I came?! I wait for you to say. - To give you back the swimming suit. Clean. Washed. That's enough for a reason, isn't it? Here you are. Actually I could return it at the swimming pool to Harry. I wanted to see where you live now. Is this a game? - As long as it give me pleasure. Then it becomes work. Those are bricks and blocks. Or an entire rooms. I arrange them. Like letters with which I write down the face of the building. I have fun. Is this circus? - Bravo, Bela. I greet you. You are ready to be in a jury. - The whole thing is like a park. Maybe a sport center or a fair with pavilions. That's a hospital. - Hospital?! I didn't want to insult you. You don't even know how much joy do you bring to me. The members of the jury wanted to insult me when they said - "that's a circus"! That's what they said "That's a circus, not a hospital"! But I was dying of fun. Just what I wanted - So I have accomplished it - hospital with a figure of a circus, fair theme park, Ferris wheel if you want. But not with the common hospital look. - You are mocking me. Not at all. I'm sorry, Bela, but that's the subject that I'm interested in. Buildings are like people. The banks, the law-courts, the hospitals, the prisons, the heavy administrative buildings... They look like people in dark suits, eternally white shirts and ties. Slow walk. No smile. Bored face. They listen, but they don't hear. They look, but they can't see. We walk to both of them with awe. Of course the respect slowly vanishes, but the fear remains. That's exactly what I wanted to do in my project for the hospital. To remove the fear. That's not a construction problem, it's psychological. I've noticed that when the important,dark people take off their suits on the beach or at the swimming pool for example, no one is afraid of them. We are all born naked. The new look of the hospital will affect the attitude inside it, too. More natural, more caring, more human... But maybe I'm wrong. At least the jury thinks so. I don't pour for you, you are dry now. Did they reject the project? - All of them voted against. Except one - he was a friend of mine. My best friend. He voted for the project because he knew that the others will reject it. So the hospital won't be built?! - No, it will! The foundations are already dug. They are building it according to my best friend's project. Solid hospital - Imposing and venerable. Hospital with black suit, white shirt and a tie. And I'm having fun. Forbidden games. There was such French movie few years ago. The kids had made cemetery and they were burying their bugs and mice. This room is something like that. Violeta Mihailova Dorcheva. I don't know her. Neither the name, nor the face. And you never know if this face goes by this name. If the passport is real Violeta might be with her grand-children in the park, now. Without even knowing that her pretty face have been under your floor for 30 years. If the card is fake we'll never know how Violeta Dorcheva looked like. And what was the name of this beautiful girl on the picture. I didn't understand anything. - It's very simple. Violeta wasn't in the resistance. They wouldn't use her passport otherwise. She even might have been a fascist. Or maybe she was nothing. But if the card is fake, the girl on the picture was persecuted by the police. And that's why she had had to hide behind different name. This pretty face can't belong to a fascist. There were few pretty ones. They were even more than the others. Pretty girls don't like to risk. In this early morning, fresh and clear like a smile of newly awaken romping boy our camera will introduce you those, who turned the motto "Swim for health" into a daily round. Swim for health and long life, we add, as we stand next to the veterans from the trainer Dyukmedzhiev's group. In front of their lively, tanned faces. In front of their, allow me to say, youthfully agile, vigorous bodies. Before diving in the deceitful chilly waters of the pool they begin their athletic morning with light recreational gymnastics. Stop. Enough. Now interviews. Prepare for the next sequence. The old people must be at the Olympic swimming pool. Prepare for the take. The old people at pool. Maro, where are you going? You'll drink water later. Take a rest at your positions. - Quickly, quickly, we are too slow. It will get dark. Don't let the old people scatter. When I say "camera", they repeat the same routine. Smiles from the old tapes. - Well, you know! Have you seen Apostol? - He's up at the tower. Comrade Dyukmedzhiev, what will you share with our viewers about your work with the veterans, are you satisfied, what are the results? Attention tape-recorder! 15th scene, second take, camera. Comrade Dyukmedzhiev, what will you share with our viewers about your work with the veterans, are you satisfied, what are the results? The training with the veterans group is not a work for me, it's a pleasure. This is actually my most disciplined group and my efforts are rewarded many times, as I see how before my eyes my trainees get stronger get younger, and like they say - lively march in the order of our working people. Thank you, comrade Dyukmedzhiev! - That's our job. Thank you, comrade Belcheva. And now... - And now... Let's see how the old people will do! - If they mumble I'll wave my hand if so - stop the camera don't waste film - All right. Let's hear the most dedicated athlete, bigger sister Mara. Stop. Can't you see that she's dry?! I need the interview after the swimming. You be careful with the focus. We shoot with lens 250. Zdravo, if I slap you - you'll become a clapperboard. Oh, I got away with it. Dora "the smile" almost took an interview from me. Did you see? What's up? Am I disturbing you? - Please, please... I learned how they call my mother. Don't blame me for someone's famous parents?! If your father was a football player you would hear even worse words. Why do they wet her? She can just go into the water? - Specificity. Ready! Camera. Sister Maro, how old are you? - 62. Do you have grand children? - Grand son. Do you read him books? Does he like our show "Good night, kids"? What show! He is an engineer in the electronic machines factory. What he reads, what he watches - I don't know. I knit all day long. Scenes with the old people in the pool. Interview with the swimmers! They stopped again. They haven't finished one thing and they start another More animated! Swimmers, people jumping from the tower. More natural. Ready... camera... stop! Comrade Belcheva, when will we see ourselves on the TV? In the next airing of "Profiles of tomorrow". Comrade, do not delay it, we don't have much time ahead of us. What is this show about? Who would watch us - the old folks?! They watch the nude youths outside all the time. People are hungry for elders. Really, what do you want to say with this show? Why us? This is a reportage, a document from the daily grind. Whatever you want to say - say it. The girls with the umbrella - go. Don't look in the camera, just chat. Are you friends really? - Only to irritate the others. They keep waiting for us to fight. - They are jealous! What for? - For being friends without reason. People hate unreasonable friendships. Apostole, tell her that I'm not such a bad person. You are! If you are not bad you will get rid of this horrible laughter. I may get rid of it. - You can't, what about the squirrels! It's like getting rid of your charm. - You killed me! She doesn't know that my motto is: Expect the unexpected! Good bye, laughter! Comrade Pavlov, excuse me, I'm interrupting your training, but from your colleagues I learned that you are physician and former partisan. From your profession and experience you know the value of life. Tell me, is this connected to your passion in sports? Of course, there is direct connection! I didn't manage to die beautifully, so I'll try to die beautiful! And let me tell you, God is responsible! He created this world beautiful, but made the man egoist, and man doesn't want to die. He runs, keeps diets, drinks herbs just to extend his time here. To upset the harmony, the nature, To create troubles for the futurists. - Pesho, where is your net?! Are you going to work or just make reflections? Turn it to the group! Ready, camera. Stop. End! A little more. The TV crew is leaving. - Apostole, she is ashamed of us! She is afraid to be seen by her mother! Right! Mothers don't believe in unexplainable friendships,why trouble her Carry cactuses even when you're with your dad. Bela! The opposition girl! I remember. What's up, doc? Did you say what you wanted? - Well, I'm old. We talk wisdom like in the fairy-tales. Go from nine countries in the tenth, There is an old man living there. Ask him. And what did you ask! About the value of life! Is there something more insulting for a man than to know the value of his life I came down from the mountains after September 9. I returned to my village. I was physician there. I'm coming home and everyone look at me in amazement. "Doctor, why are you coming home? Aren't you killed?" You - the killed one, are coming home, and the others who weren't killed are not And the real story is that, the district constable have killed some other partisan - Mitio Tenev. He have beheaded him. So he went to the village square and said: "Here is the doctor's head!" And no one recognized it. Who looks at sawn head!? And the constable did that in order to take more money. The prize for Mitio Tenev's head was 50000 leva. The prize for mine - 100000 leva. And I think of his children, when they have cried, for what amount of money they cried-for 50000 or 100000?! If silence is gold, this car is a treasure! That's an idea! The silence of two men and one woman in "Moskvich 407". Start! End. I have a treasure in my recording! This is unique! I have never thought to record silence. Silence of a worker in front of his boss. Silence of a boss in front of bigger boss. Silence of someone facing someone else. - Silence of a driver facing a policeman Silence of one policeman in front of three hooligans. One minute silence. - Silence at the statue of... Silence of the statue itself. - Silence in front of the silence. Silence is not gold, but weakness. Just a moment. So, what is silence? - Weakness, you fool! Thank you. What is silence? Silence is trust. - Thank you. I'm here. Stop for a moment and wait. I'm coming right away! Excuse me, what do you think is the silence? Thank you. Excuse me, what do you think is the silence? Do they beat him often? - He gets away, he is charming! Didn't you like it? Silence of a young and beautiful girl facing uncomfortable question. I like it with you. Silence of a confused grown-up man facing a young and insolent girl. The Bulgarian adore the media. Put a mike in his face and he won't ask you anything. Attention. What is silence for you, tell me in few words! Silence is approval to everything and to keep quiet, what else! If you talk too much... - If you talk to much - you are wrong! Tell us what is silence for you? - Get lost! What silence? - What is silence?! It means a lot of things. Worried person - Thank you. Silence... what silence?! Silence is the best thing. To be silent, no to say... That's it. Excuse me, what do you think is the silence? Silence?! Why are you showing me this? This is microphone. - You are recording my words!? Yes. - Silence is stupid. It's just talking, fighting is the truth Silence is half dead man. Do you understand? Silence is gold - is that so, and talking is silver. If you talk you might be wrong. If you don't-you won't,but you won't say a thing Excuse me, what is the silence? - Silence is gold, gold! Because if you talk too much you pay for it. Silence is gold. Excuse me? Silence... thank you. Excuse me, what is the silence? - Silence is gold! Gold. As the saying is. - There is such saying. Excuse me, what do you think is the silence? It's a way to get deep in thought. When someone doesn't know what to say he keeps silence! Is this the silence? - Yes. Excuse me, would you tell me what is silence and after all what does it mean? - Well, I can't talk, I have soar throat - Thank you. Excuse me, we are making a blitz interview, Silence is gold. - Gold. Silence is gold. - I don't know for sure. What do you think is the silence? - Excuse me? The silence? - The biggest sign of hypocrisy. Gold. - Yes, gold! The silence... - I think that silence is gold. If you can use it, it is a lot. - Gold. What do you think is the silence? - Gold. What do you think is the silence? - Excuse me? What do you think is the silence? - Silence is... How should I put it, I think... The silence is... Excuse me? - The silence is gold! And how about you? And how about you? Bela, is this how the autumn fashion will look like? Retro style. Nostalgic. Humble and virgin. - End of the individualistic riot! End of the chaotic dancing. Males and amazons coupling with each other again. You are so cultured, so well-informed, just like hairdressers! Bela... Not a blind form of fashion norms, but a harmonic mix of taste, Tradition and national character. That's the image of the youth today, not fashionable, but contemporary. Thank you anyway. I were overzealous with the quantity. And the quality? Who is she? - I don't know. I hope your mother doesn't learn! Almost like it was. - Almost. It used to be a hiding-place, now it's just a hole. You know, Bela, the doctor is right. You are an opposition girl, really. Me? - You. I can call you like that, can't I? Age is age after all. - You can. And what's so opposite about me? - You start backwards. People end their lives with memories, you start yours with memories. With your memories. I can talk like that can't I? I'm as old as you are, now. Bela. Good evening. Get lost. All right. Madness has limits, too. Turn on the lights. Bela, you are overdoing it. We aren't comrade Paskov. We gonna do it, intimately... Who was Paskov? You don't know comrade Paskov - the chief of the electricity company?! Please, he lives in our building. Last year, on New Year's Eve he went to celebrate with some friends They were playing cards when his wife realized that she's forgotten the iron on "The iron is on.What should we do" Their friend's house was far from our building they didn't want to break their game, so comrade Paskov just called one phone and told the personnel to switch off the electricity of the entire district. You are lying! - Please,we saw the New Year with candles Thank you. - Is this comrade Paskov. My surname is Panchev and my name is even funnier - Apostol. Usually after that they ask me - Petar or Pavel? Are you Sagittarius? They are aggressive. No, I'm an architect. - Bela, he's cool! And what have you built? The Rila monastery or the Old Plovdiv? You almost got it. I have built few houses, which look like old ones. - Have you ever tried to build a building which really looks like new building?! Even the Old Plovdiv was new once. Misho. Swank, swank! - I didn't understand you. You have built new buildings which look like old ones. What does this mean? You build and wink. "I know how much they cost, but" "I get away with it". And you are OK. - Satisfied? I was joking. I can't stand it, when someone forgives his past with laughter. As Marx haven't said. - It's fine, but the past doesn't forgive The past catches you and never lets you go! - Let me go! Let me go! - I'm the past, I won't let you go! We were, you will be, we forgot that there is another tense. Present! I prefer the present. You rely on your youth, but youth is too short to be enough for your entire life. Only a portion of it is enough for me. If it's a pleasant portion. Do you know how they call this? - Egoism according to you. I said it very proudly. - I said "according to you", I think it's just frankness. That's what I think. Looks like that the problem is in your thinking. You think only for yourselves and rely only on yourselves. - On what else could we rely? There is nothing else. I'm just this - one t-shirt and a pair of jeans. Don't you feel a little bit naked. Usually a person is much more than that. For example? Creditable past. Bright future,fame,complexes,conscience I can live without them. I don't even need the shirt. Thank God, I don't have belly yet. Could you live without your work or car? I can take off my jeans, too, can you? Come on, take off everything you have! Past, present, future and be naked. Or we just gonna wink at ourselves?! We will build new, but it will look like old! Let me tell you something, Don't take your clothes off without reason. I hope you don't get scabies in some trenches, because if it happens they will take your clothes off and they'll cover you with sulfur. And if someday,somewhere someone wants to humiliate you and depersonalize you in such a way that you forget who you are they'll take off you clothes by force. When you consume your portion of life, before they dress you with your newest clothes they will get you naked and wash you, and you won't even feel it. Forgive me for the lecturing, but it's from my age. I'm leaving. Come on. The candles show is over! Bye, Bela. - Bye. Bye. - See you tomorrow. Call me. Good bye. - Good bye. Bela, help me, I feel like an old fool. I don't know how to act, what to talk. It's fine, I was attacked by ghosts, that's why I called you. I wanted to see you here, again. To make sure that everything was real. I'm not in love. I've always wanted to have a friend like my father, but not really a father. Someone I can share everything to. To be clever and stupid with him and brave and faint-hearted, strong and weak, to be what I am and what I'm not. Like Bufo said-unexplainable friendship Just to tease the others. People don't believe in our friendship. If he was a dog they wouldn't be surprised because from ancient times they teach us that the dog is man's best friend. But my friend is not a dog, He doesn't fawn on me, doesn't lick my hand. What kind of friend is that?! That's what people think. Let them think what they want. I put a hand on my heart and I present you my best friend - Georges. Bravo, Georges! Bravo, Georges! Uncle, do you want to be my friend? - All right! Give me your hand. If you buy me spun sugar. - All right. For me, too! - Easy, you'll eat my ears! First for me! - Six red ones. I want red, too. For me, too... Green, yellow, pink? - Pink. I want spun sugar, too! - First for me. Give me, give me! - One more. Hello, what is going on there, how long will we wait you!? Relax, it's fine! - Fine, what's fine? What's fine?! The fact that you don't break the line?! It's my turn? - Hey, hobbledehoy, speak like that to your father. I've been watching you for half an hour. It was his turn. Are those bastards on the line too? Oh, come on! - What, I have children, too, don't I? Is she on the line, too? Bela, what are you doing! - Wait... Why do you jest with me? I'll hit you like that! I want to be fluffy baby in a basket. And when some people get in a fight, I want someone to put me between them. For example between the Greeks and the Turks in Cyprus. Between the Catholics and the Protestants in Ireland. Between Syria and Israel. And If they are not touched... You'll put spun sugar on their faces. And they will fire guns at you. The ideologist of friendship. I was at you show. - And where are the flowers and kisses? Georges was fantastic! - Oh, Georges, yes. Don't get me an inferiority complex that's equal to death for the artist. There was a jury, too. They approved Georges. We'll be fine for the summer. Hey, when I start talking for art I feel like drinking. That way, being afraid to become real artist, you'll remain... A clown. What can I do, that's my mission in life. To live the wrong way, so everyone else can see how they shouldn't live. That's so banal. You wasn't a stage artist, you was a stage hero from very banal play. I talk nonsense. That's how I answer those spiders who ask just for the asking How are you, Bufo? - Great. Are you working? - Yes. Do you earn? - I earn. And I'm respected. Hard-workers are fashionable today. And no one have told me that it's banal. - Even Apostol?! We don't ask questions to each other. We understand each other. And we drink. We drink so well, that one who see us feels like drinking. The truth is different. But it's not easy to be spoken. The beat me because of you, shouldn't I slap myself a few times, too?! Everyone says - I have no happiness, no time, no chance... No one says - I have no talent. They are ashamed of their mediocrity like... like it's a venereal disease. But it's a God's job. That's the truth, Bela. That's not true. I saw you and I wonder why you waste your time with small stuff. The crowed laugh. They applauded you. If they put some lights and electronics on George, they'll laugh at him, too. Talent is something else. Talent does not make you laugh. Doesn't make you cry. Talent elevates. Before reaching for Hamlet's monologue "To be or not to be?" the actor has to ask himself will he be or he won't. I asked myself this question. But I had graduated from the Academy already. Horrible! You are a beast. You eat yourself, but I'm scared. Where am I headed to then, barefooted on the window-displays? Is this my path? If I had your body, your walk, I would walk the streets in lingerie. Just to delight the people. - Yes, but Bulgaria's continental climate In the winter? It's easy for the pretty girls throughout the year. We'll go through it somehow. Give me your shovel. Long live the union between the ugly and the poor ones. We are great power. Picasso is one of a kind. Einstein is one of a kind. We are millions. We are millions... "Who are you, who are you? Aren't you just like me." "Aren't you just like me? Just no one like me." "Oh, then we together. We are together by ourselves." "We are together by ourselves. Just no one." "But don't betray him. - Let's just don't say a word." "Let's just don't say a word!" "They will laugh at us." - "Think about it, think!" "How funny it is? To be me, to be you." "To be somebody - me and you!" "And before a delighted puddle, charmed by you," "to repeat your name without a break" "And delighted before a puddle, to repeat everyday" "to repeat fascinated..." "croak, croak, croak..." "your name, croak, croak, croak." Hello, bonne journee mademoiselle, please, I want to speak to Mr. Picasso! Who Picasso?! Pablo. - He's dead. It doesn't matter. All the things that I can't say on the other phone, I say on this phone. It's not connected anywhere, that's why it connects me with everyone. Hello, Marilyn?! Hi, Marilyn. I can't believe it, she's had enough of her fortune, beauty and fame. Hello? Do you know how many people would kill their father, sell their children just to have what you have?! Well, you are right, it's their problem! Was it easy to give up everything, Marilyn? Hello... Hello! These American phones, Watergate really put them into a mess. Hey, Yankee, don't tap the line, there is no need, I'm talking nonsense. I don't speak what I think. Hello, hello... it's dead! And now? - Now... God. Listen, Jesus Christ, son of a mother, this thing with the slap - "whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him", did you make it up or Judas whispered it to you? Excuse me? How come Bela?! What a shame, he's trying to slip out.He says that you are master of the slapping. Hello, hello, Bella, can you hear me? Bela, is that you?! Guess. A friend of Georges. His best friend. The ideologist of friendship. Friendship is my vocation, my talent. What Bufo, I'm no Bufo. It's me, ask Georges. George is not well. He has spleen. He's crying and screaming - "Mum, come home". That's why I called - he want us to put him in a basket and get him to the fronts You haven't guessed yet? Boyan, with the many "B"s. Boyan Boyanov Boaynov from the bungalow in Boyana. Yes, it's a collection. I need only one more "B" - the dearest one. Can't you think of it, Bela? B - like Bulgaria, Borovets. B - like, oh God, you are so slow! How are you going to make it in this world? Bela, give me your hand. I'll lead you. Hello? Did you say something? Squirrels? It's not the zoo here, is it? Hello? Who is interrupting? What squirrels? There are no squirrels. Bela, this is the first asking for a hand in the world done via phone! Did I do something wrong? - It's a joke, isn't it. It depends on you. Standing here and irritate us, as if we are not alone! Are we alone now? - I am. You must say. - I can't say it with simple words. You will laugh at me. But you are right. We are not alone. You are not alone, too I thought that it's just me. Even when he's not around. We are friends. - We are just friends, too. He came at home, when everyone was telling me about the future That's what all graduates are forced to listen to. And he suddenly took me back in the past and my life became more simple and rich. These are the big words, which I wanted to share with you. I'm not in love. He is entirely in the past. Even when he works, when he swim, or when he wastes his time with us, and when he drives his broken car and when he runs with his baggy jeans. He's constantly waiting for something, which will never come.. Apostol is not in the past, the past is in him. It's different. That's why he's wearing his baggy jeans and drives his broken car And you are in love with him, and with his broken car and baggy jeans. I came to take the keys for the car. Doctor Pavlov had a heart attack in the pool. The took him out dead. We have to help the family.. Harry, we changed the water recently! - Small accident, comrade Panayotov. One of my trainees drowned yesterday. He had a heart attack, to be precise. He was like that in the water. We took him out immediately. He didn't swallow water, but he died in an instance. - Young or old? Well, in his 60s. It happens. Do you have troubles? - No. I called the emergency. They wrote the death certificate. Everything is fine. Why do you change the water than? - My group won't swim in the same water They are afraid. As if the death is infectious. All right, then see you tomorrow. - The day after tomorrow. We'll use the occasion to fix the bottom I just want to tell you that this is very stupid, nonsense indeed. You think that you are bold, but you are miserable. You think that your eyes are crushing me and that I don't know where to hide? What do you expect from your mental attack? You have fun. You have fun your entire life! Don't you feel that it's pettiness? I shouldn't tell you myself, but I was the only one, who defended your project for hospital I don't need gratitude, I don't ask you to change your attitude to me. I defended your design, because I liked it. And I voted for it, and I signed the protocol like everyone else - without reservations, without this moral "r", which you value so much. As you can see I have reservations, but I don't fuss around. Because I want to work. The philosopher would say... Was it Descartes or someone else... "I think, therefore I am". We are architects - in order to live we must build. My thoughts, my ideas, my projects - they are not enough for me. It's not enough for me to know what I can do. I want the others to know it, too I want people to live in houses, which I have built. To withdraw money from my bank. To be under treatment in my hospital. You want the same, don't you? Well, try to do it. Try to do what people like, not what you like. You know how it works? Take that halo off your head and start working. Working is not like swimming pool - you'll get dirty. But you will work. I have to tell you that your new project for swimming pool will be rejected, too. It's not bad, but it's yours. People became realists. They've had enough of your fanaticism. Have fun, pile up models in your attic. And I want to work! I can't stop working. And you walk after me, weigh on my conscience. Look at me. How long? Poison and hand grenade - owned by Apostol Panchev. Bela! What are you doing? Mum, what would you say if I marry a foreigner and go abroad? In Argentina? Mum, really?! If I go and never call again, will you look for me long? If I never call again, will you look for me for ever? Are you mad? Because of this rags! I wish we could talk at least once for something which you can't eat, or touch, or even something stupid! No, I'm tired of nonsense. They pay me to talk nonsense. I want to hear something meaningful from you. What's going on in this house? Is that it? - I found a passport on the street. I put a notice in the newspaper and the woman came to take it. I haven't seen you wasting your time like that. Days go by and I don't know what you have decided yet! Will you study or you'll remain with the education which your dad wanted for you. I haven't decided yet. - Why haven't you? You have to decide.You can't stand in the window-display for your entire life. Like in a TV. I really think, mum. Why no one accepts thinking as a job? There is no such position. - If I had power, I would make everyone - no matter the profession or the position, to lay on their back for one hour every day and to think. No matter what for. They could think for something stupid, but they would think. In the company of music - as they learn foreign languages. Best way to think is in the company of delta blues. Have you tried? The slower and sadder the better. The voice must be cracked. What should I think for? For us. This foreigner - the Argentinean, how did it crossed your mind? Like it crossed your mind, now. I was thinking about dad. He sends letters, packages, telegrams from time to time... He gives signs that he's alive and we are calm. What if he suddenly stop sending letters and disappear somewhere in Morocco. Are we going to look for him then?! Mum, what would you say if I marry, but just for Bulgarian boy? Thank you. Attention, ladies and gentlemen, there is no mystery, no magic. There are no miracles, and there are no supernatural things. There is only mental flexibility and sleight of hands. Everyone of you can learn my little illusions if you pay attention. And you can demonstrate them to your friends. Attention! One, two, three. It's little bit yellow. - The camera is Japanese. "Agfa" are better, but they're more expensive, too!How much they want for it? As much as I can give. - I hate it when they tell me this. That's why I don't do business with friends! - Such a friend. Did you take the negative? - No, just the photos. Then take him to a dinner and break you head. You are jealous, that's why you talk like that. I'll buy it, and I won't take pictures of you! - Bye. So we have a deal. I'll go home. I'll take Georges. We'll go to the summer stage. I'll strangle him. I'll collect the flowers and will return here. Should I come to take you? - I don't know where I'm going to be. I'll come by myself. I'll wait for you! Right, Bela? - With a reason or without? With vodka. It's for you. Watch it. Examine it. And preserve it most jealously. Now I know - I'll keep it safe. - Bye, see you tonight! All right. - Now push. See you tonight. The halls of the bungalow in "Boyana" are at your service Cold buffet and hot drinks. Intimate light. Packed air. 5000 balloons in the colors of the rainbow. 1000 candles, 5 km. of tapes and music without a break. In this early morning, fresh and clear like a smile of newly awaken romping boy, our camera will introduce you those, who turned the motto "Swim for health" into a daily round. Swim for health and long life, we will add, as we stand next to the veterans from the trainer Dyukmedzhiev's group.. In front of their lively, tanned faces. In front of their, allow me to say, youthfully agile, vigorous bodies. Before diving in the deceitful chilly waters of the pool they begin their athletic morning with light recreational gymnastics. The good start is half the win! The training with the veterans group is not a work for me, it's a pleasure. This is actually my most disciplined group. All my efforts are rewarded many times when I see before my eyes how my trainees get stronger get younger,and like they say-lively march in the order of our working people Thank you, comrade Dyukmedzhiev. Now, it would be interesting for me and our viewers to learn something more about your activities and to dip along with the ageless veterans in the cool clean water. Comrade Pavlov, excuse me, I'm interrupting your training, but from your colleagues I learned that you are physician and former partisan. From your profession and experience you know the value of life. Tell me, is this connected to your passion in sports? Yes, I didn't manage to die beautifully, so I'll try to die beautiful! "To live beautifully" doctor Pavlov wanted to say, because he believes that with the power of his will, man can beat anything, even his own death. Tosh! - Poor fellow, when he was alive, they said that he's dead, and now... Death. Let's not be afraid to say this word. Let's not be afraid of it, like doctor Pavlov, sister Mara, tireless bai Tacho the excellent Penka, even the veteran of the veterans the 84 y.o. grand-dad Hristo Death's ominous shadow can't darken the sunny days of these pool people as everyone calls them now, because a spirit of cheerfulness and good mood joy, freshness and optimism stirs from their eyes and faces. From the natural jokes and teasing. From their games and clever competitions which occupy their day. And in which they put all of their sports passion. Faith in life,in yourself,in the comrade and the group, that's what you can see at the trainings of these, I would say, old people from a new kind. To live beautiful. These simple words, said so naturally by one contemporary of us, make us supportive to a movement of spiritual elevation in which we are witnesses and participants every day. It's time to say good bye again. See you next Wednesday, friends. New, even more interesting meetings with coevals of ours are ahead of us - heroes of the show "Profiles of tomorrow" Interview by the editor Dora Belcheva. You haven't said "What have we done" yet I've read that that's what men say. In the old novels. And the girls cry. Natural. I'm from the opposite ones. And why do they cry? - That's the custom. They are taught that they loose their purity and innocence. I don't feel neither guilty, nor sinful. Just more honest. I'm great lady. - They used to say "Fatal woman". I am fatal woman. Every woman who is sign cancer is fatal! Don't. We should go. Boyan will be back soon. We promised him to be together. We promised. Can we be together now? - I want us to be together forever! Few days ago we were in this room with Boyan and we were thinking about you. Now we think about him. - The triangle is complete! Like in the old novels. - Triangle? Me, you and Boyan? I can't think of you so separately. I have a feeling that you are one person Two faces of one man. Do you know? Triangle with two sides - me and you. There are no triangles with two sides. When we get closer to someone we always get far from someone else. That's not true. That's stuff from the old novels, just to make people cry. I don't want to part with you, no matter what. Answer. Answer. Hello... Hello, Boyane, is that you? I'm Bela. Apostol left. He didn't say a word. Actually he said. He smiled and said that short names sound good. Bufo and Bela - do you remember? Do you still ask for my hand? Yes, on the phone. Take it. This will be the first in the world giving of a hand by phone. Forgive you for what? What squirrels? Nonsense. You don't know me. I'm fatal woman. Whoever is Cancer is fatal woman! What do you know? Georges, you are my best friend. People may think what they want. You are my best friend. And I'm your best friend. That's the truth! Answer, you miserable dummy! Say that you are my best-best-best Do you hear me? Say it! Don't make me angry! Come on! Repeat after me! You are my best, best... Repeat or I'll kill you! Come on, please, one last time... You are my best... best... best... Do you hear, Georges?
