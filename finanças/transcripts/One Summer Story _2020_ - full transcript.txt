Remember, there's no such thing as perfect. The uneven episode is divine...! They worked extra hard on it. - Tama Shinji? - Yes. In the 1st run they had no time to paint Mortar properly. I recorded it. Seriously? Yes. They barely made it in time so Mortar is blue. Can you rip it? It's only possible to see on our TV. OK. I'll come over to see it. I'm kidding. I didn't expect that. Your ear? I got water in it today... - Why are you doing it? - Sorry. I'm going this way. I'll get my bag. - Where is it? - On the 3rd floor. - OK. - See you. Tell me where you live! Seriously? That gave me a jolt. See you. Gravel, gravel! It's stuck... "Moji" - You came. - Hi. Hard to find? I got you a Yummy Bar. You did? Much appreciated. Come in. Your house is a mansion! It's just a house. It's not! What does your father do? - A calligrapher. - Really? His father, too. Are you mocking my family? - A calligrapher? - And his dad, too. Go ahead. Thank you. My parents are out so I'll get you a drink. - Thanks. - No problem. - Thanks. - No problem. My parents are out so relax. No one's home so barley tea's about all I can offer. That's good. Thanks. Make yourself at home. Thank you. I found some Calpis so... Mortar was blueish... By the way, Minami, that talisman you have... I guess that means that you're... What? Well, you know what I mean... I don't know what that talisman is. someone sent it to me on my last birthday. Who? Probably my father. My first one. He's my biological dad. Mom remarried. Really! I wouldn't have guessed... A common reaction. What's the talisman? It's from a new religious sect. Really? It's called The Chest of Light. We're not believers. My father and grandfather work for the leader. They write them? Uh...yes. Ghost writers? Like for famous people? - No. - It is. - It is... - See? Don't tell anyone. Who do you think I'd tell? Your biological father. I won't tell him. I've never met him. I guess, I have but I was too little to remember. I see. I don't know his face or where he lives. He might want to meet you? Maybe that's why your dad sent you the talisman? Uh maybe. I could hire someone. "Private Investigator for Hire" The bus is coming. Okay Where was that? This inspired Buffalo Koteko The Magical Plasterer! Tell me, Doughnut! I'll lend it to you. - Can I? - I saw it 100 times. See you. Listen. I know a private eye. My brother is one. Maybe he can find your dad. "The Chest of Light” "The Chest of Light” "The Chest of Light" "The Chest of Light" "The Chest of Light" "The Chest of Light" A wall is not something to get over but to plaster over with your Magic Wishes It's all within the heart of a plasterer You and I, together we'll plaster walls Buffalo plaster! What's your brother like? What's your brother like? He's like... - It's hard to explain. - Why? Do you have siblings? A kid brother with an arm leve of 530. So, he's a boy then? He's my brother so... Yes. Why? Nothing. | "Used Books" - Hello. - There you are. Hello. It's been a while. Is my brother here? Hold on. Aki, your brother's here! OK, I'm coming down! (Your girl?) No! You came! Hey. Hello. I'm Minami Sakuta. I'm Akihiro. Come upstairs... Now do you see? Yes, got it. Are you taller? I don't know... Thank you. So what's on your mind? Well, OK. Can you find my father? Um... You're asking me? Aren't you a private eye? I was but it was part-time. I'd look for missing cats... Cats? "No Smoking" I guess this is bigger than a missing cat... But... This is mine. Allow me. That's my life savings. Will it be enough? Don't cry over someone's savings. Is it too little? No, that's not it... When I was your age, Minami I saved up for reassignment surgery... It reminds me of that. Thanks. You're welcome. Alright... We have a clue. Here. Here. The Chest of Light I guess he's a believer. May I ask his name? I know his family name. It's "Waragai.” "Wara"...? It's "straw" and "ravine". That's unusual! Also... I think my dad took this photo. "Minami, 3 years old, at the beach near the clinic" My mom married my stepdad when I was 5. My brother was born and our life's been idyllic. Mom never mentions my biological dad. So I know nothing about him. My mascara... I'll have panda eyes! Your poor dad... It's like he ever existed. Kind of. I can relate. Our family kicked Aki out. I knew they wouldn't accept me as a woman. You know how calligraphers are. Okay. I'll do it. Really? I'm no detective... Won't that be a problem? Our family works for the sect so that should open doors... Right! I'm glad your're not a private investigator. - Right? - Yes! Thank you! You're welcome. I get it... Good girl. Next in the preliminaries is the Womens's 100m Backstroke. Excuse me. Are you Shohei Moji? Wrong guy, sorry. Your sexy eyes, face and hat give you away. Why are you here? Minami invited me. | How about you? Me too! You know that! In the 8th lane is Minami Sakuta, Iwata High. In the 8th lane is Minami Sakuta, Iwata High. Go, Minami! I found him. Her father. "Mitsuumi Tani"? Aka Tomomitsu Waragai. The leader. He founded Chest of Light around the time Minami was born. So she can't remember him... He was probably busy with the sect. It was him who commissioned our family to write talismans. I see... So she can visit him there. It's not that easy... I dont know why but he vanished a while ago. OK, buckle up, we're off! "Take your mark." Minami! Come on! Hey, is Minami smiling...? She is. What the hell...? The world is big... Even your captain, our best swimmer, lost in the prelims. But I'm so happy that you chose this school. Failing at official competitions is an experience. It will help you along in life! Keep that school spirit of yours forever! Capeesh? Yes! Go ahead, Captain. Sorry but I can't! I'm sorry! OK, you're dismissed. You did well! Thank you. You did what you could. It's up to us now. Right. Let's go. Gravel, gravel! You came! You tried. That's what counts... I'm impossible! I smile when I should be serious. I understand that. Where's your brother? He went home, he's afraid of getting a tan. I bet. I didn't know you were here. He wanted me to pass on a message. Oh? About your father Hi, Moji! Why are you here? - You know him? - Yes. Wer're classmates. I can't imagine that! I can't see why... You know him? We're Koteko mates. Buffalo plaster! OK, about your father There she is! Minami! Sorry, Minami! What's going on, guys? We just arrived. - You didn't make it? - The traffic... It was my personal best! It's Miyaji! Hi, Haruo. How did you get here? In our Toyota! It's too slow! Um... I'll text you later... You found him? I thought he was missing... You found him? I thought he was missing... That's quick! Where is he? The place in the photo! It's not far. I can just visit him. I need time... I didn't expect you to find him so soon. Let me think about it. Whoa, Miyaji! - Here. - Thanks. It's like a manga story. But it isn't. A movie, adapted from a manga. That's the worst! Anime fans don't like all the manga adaptations. I'll help you with your plan. Thanks. I'll buy you an ice candy. So you'll pretend to go away on camp while you visit your biological dad. I'll join you on the first night. And your parents can't know. Wait... He leads a sect? That sounds suspect! You'll be abducted for sure! What? They'll emancipate you! What's that mean? I don't know. You're his daughter so... You're in line! You'll be the new leader! No way... The child takes over. That's what the talisman was for! You'll be in a feud over the leadership succession. A feud? You're smiling? Hello. Is Moji home? I'am Moji. Uh, is Shohei home? - You done? - No. No? Hold the brush here... What should I write? You can do it from above like this. Out diagonally to the left. Everyone, listen up! Don't tell anyone but beautifully written characters leave the paper. That's a lie! } It's true. You write "flame" very well and the flame will come out of, the paper. No, that's a total lie OK, look up at the ceiling. OK, look up at the ceiling. I wrote "dragon" a few years ago and it jumped out of the paper through the roof! I know that's not true! So it's important that you focus! Keep going. Enough. I know he was lying. Dragons are extinct. - Goodbye! - See you, kids. Goodbye, Mr. Moji. See you later, alligator! See you later, alligator See you later, windbreaker! Windbreaker! Windbreaker! Sorry, I just finished. Just a moment. You're such a good teacher! It's only during the summer, unfortunately. Unfortunately? Teaching these kids lowers my "Hit Points” but they'll forget me when summer's over. They might forget you but you'll be in every letter they write. - That's deep. - I know. Here's the DVD and my review... plus a Yummy Bar. Thank you. A review? The smell of ink...! The smell of a calligraphy class. You're good at teaching. I guess we can teach the things we learned. I bet you could teach someone how to swim. But I've never done that... But you could. - You think? - Yes. - You think? - Yes. “Plasterer” I'll do one more. - Here. - Thanks. My brother said that youre going to go. Yes, thanks to you. You think it's safe? Do you think there will be a succession feud? Yeah, and an assassination. I hadn't thought of that! Run if there's an assassination. I'll watch out. I hope your father is a nice man. Should I call him “Dad"? You know, I already have a father. You know the dish, “chicken and egg donburi"? They're in the same bowl but they're not family. So you'll be OK. Sorry, I didn't get that. Oh, you're so focused. Never mind. I don't know what you mean but thank you. Done. "Assassination"? Assassination. This is as rare as a blizzard! - I helped you last week! - You did? I bought some poultice for you to take to camp. Thanks. Can I take a photo? - Of what? - You, Mom. Whoa Kid! That's so out of the blue. My friends said you're cute so the boys want a photo. Jesus! But I'm not wearing make-up. They don't expect much. - But you said - Whatever. Who said it? They deserve a gift. - Forget it! - They said I was cute... Yes but... - I want to repay them. - Don't you dare. Am I? - Cute? - You want me to say it? Am I? Yes, you are. - No funny faces. - Come on, Harue. Ready? JOIN US. - No! - Come on. I'll get my Yamato. Forget it! Come on! I'll put on makeup. Forget all that! Come on! - What's that for? - Dad! Ready? Here we go... We did good! Do I look cute? You made this face... Off I go. Have fun. Mom, don't record over Koteko. O.K. Corral. Bye, guys. Minami. Have this. I got it from a colleague who knows I love anime. Leap back safely! Have fun, Croak! OK. See you, Dad. "Abori Shiatsu Massage Clinic" This was on the photo. Yes. Mr. Waragai used to be a masseur. Mr. Abori was his mentor. Your dad's staying in Mr. Abori's guesthouse. There. Let's go. "How's camp? Mom" Come on, Minami. "We've arrived. It's nice!" Can I trust you? Yes. We met the other day. The private investigator! How do you do? Is Mr. Waragai home? He died. No, he didn't! Uncle's peeping right now. No, really... He's dressing up. I'm coming! Are you dressed up? Hush! Sorry to keep you waiting. I brought your daughter. Welcome. Uh, I'm... Minami Sakuta. Your daughter. I'm Tomomitsu Waragai. Your father. You came so far! You came so far! “Love from Emushi Beach" She's Mr. Abori's granddaughter. There are no kids here. Her grandpa doesn't want to play so she comes here. _ Because your're lonely! Jinko. This young lady is my child. She's a child? But she's big! Minami. You've come all this way... say something. Uh, well... You shaved... Right. I don't need my beard anymore... It's smooth! Is it related to being a preacher...? It can be tough... so I'm taking a break. What got you into it in the beginning? You want to know? I can see. What? I can see what's in people's heads. Will you be OK by yourself? You heard him, right? It's totally weird. That thing about "The eighth eye in the mortal world"? It's too wild! I can't leave. I'll take the train to camp. Anyhow... I'm glad you met your dad. Yes. Oh no! My lacrimal glands are acting up! - Take care. One big family! Oh... Jinko? She went home from the garden. Right. That room's not being used | and there's a futon. Uh...OK. There's no TV. Is it boring? No, I'm fine. How about the beach? Do you remember this place? No? I guess not. The three of us often came here. I have a photo of this beach... You do? How is your mom? Uh...she's fine. What did she say? I see, where are you supposed to be? At a swimming camp. I see. So you're in the swimming team, Minami? Swmimming's my thing. I see. I know nothing about you, Minami. Here. Take a look. Your mom's aged! Me too, I guess. The man with Yamato is your dad? And this is my brother. I see. Is your dad good to you? Actually I’m more like Dad. We have mere in common. Like what? Like anime. I see. You like anime, Minami? I see. So... Why did you send me the talisman’? Let's see... How can I put it? I thought that as you were older I'd give you a hint. Why not tell me straight out? I thought it would be unfair to your parents. It is the same in the end. I know! You're a good swimmer so can you teach Jinko how to swim? She can't swim. Well, OK. I don't know if I can... So you'll stay over? Yeah... Maybe. You can take a bath first. Was that too much? Sorry. I wanted to try being a dad. Remember I told you That I have the ability to see? I don't want you to get the wrong idea but it's true. So a group of people made me their prophet. Suddenly everyone acted deferential... Do you have that ability, Minami? Did I inherit it? No, not me. I see... So you're more like your mom. Show me then. Now? Yes, It's hard to believe! I close my eyes? It's OK. Keep them open. Do I hold my breath like for an X-ray? Don't do anything. Hamburg steak. Sorry? You want one for dinner? What? Are you locked up? I'm OK now. What's that mean? Have you been brainwashed? I just feel sorry for him. Do you? He says he can read minds with the Eyes of Light but he can't. What do you mean? I should've gone with you. Come on! The Hamburg steak was great! What? OK! One Hamburg steak, ready to go! Hello? He's coming. I'll be there tomorrow. Sorry! Good night! Minami! Looks good! - Can I help? - It's OK. "I'm working so please teach Jinko" “how to swim. There's soup to reheat.” God works... ? The long lost daughter! Oh my God, she's grown so big! Sorry to bust in. You look just like him but not entirely. Welcome back, Minami! - Get off her, Grandpa! - It's OK! It's over the top But I used to change your diaper. Mom, Grandpa... Sorry. Your dad's busy with a customer. God's customer...? Minami! Remember we used to go to the beach all the time? We played there! That's good. Right there... When I let go, try to float. Ready, one, two... That's good. Try to relax. When you kick, you won't sink. Let me show you how it's done. See? Let's try again. OK. One, two... That's good! Why don't we give it another try? Ready? Kick and relax... Now... Why don't we take a break? Croquettes! There's a TV... I bought it when I got the groceries. You bought croquettes and a TV? What would you like for dinner? We're still eating lunch! Is there any food you don't like or can't eat? No, I'm pretty flexible. That's great. What food do you like? - Udon noodles. - I see. I love bananas. You do? Sorry. Don't you want to watch TV? My show's not on. What is it? You won't know it. Come on. Buffalo Koteko, the Magical Plasterer. What? Buffalo Koteko, the Magical Plasterer. - I don't know it. - Told you! When is the last day of camp? In a few more days. I see. Ko-Te-Ko is Ko-Te-Ko, read backwards! Ko-Te-Ko is Ko-Te-Ko, read forwards! “Miyaji calling" Minami. Wake up. Can you show me how to swim too? Get away from here! Keep kicking! And relax. Are you OK? Let's do it again. OK, give it a try. One, two... You keep drifting because of the current. Are you going to teach Uncle? No! That outlaw flashed his speedos at a teenage girl. It's the outlaw! The camp ends tomorrow! I know but... I feel sorry for him. What? You've been brainwashed. Did he make you drink his blood? You've been brainwashed. Did he make you drink his blood? Come on! Minami? I didn't drink any. Are you meditating ? There's none of that! Are you OK? I'll see you tomorrow. I make sure of it Adieu. Adieu. Watch out. - Is this enough? - More please. When did it start? What...? The Eyes of Light. I've always had it but I didn't tell anyone until I was an adult. So no one taught you... That's right. My friend said people can teach what they learned. That explains it. I tried to teach it for years but it didn't work out. That's why they singled me out as a god... Right. I guess it's not easy being god. You seem relaxed with this kind of conversation. I'm not really. But I'm interested in telepathy, magic and stuff because I've always loved anime. I see. You can teach me. What? You know what. Eyes of Light. We have a new student at Minami Swimming School. Capeesh? I'm Tomomitsu Waragai. I'll do my best. Clap! Capeesh? She let you in? Yes. We made a deal. Dead! Good corpse. What's this for, ma'am? My mom taught me how to swim and how to play dead like this. My mom taught me how to swim and how to play dead like this. So that's what your teacher did. If you can act like a orpse here you can do it in the sea. If you can act like a corpse here you can do it in the sea. Stay dead! Yes, ma'am. A corpse can't talk. Corpses don't talk! You gotta work harder. That's very good. I'm here to learn, sir. OK, first... To slide your mind into another person's, make layers in your mind like mille-feuille. You lost me from the get-go. OK, let's see... If I make mille-feuille, then what? Then... Slide your mille-feuille into that person's mille-feuille. The person's... Each layer of a the person's mille-feuille becomes visible. Basically that's how it goes. What's that, Jinko? My-homework's about mille-feuille. Dont! You'll be teased. It didn't work! It takes time. Morning, day or night we say, aloha! It's showtime! Let's hear it for The Emushi Beach Hula Dancers! Hanae! I guess... You dont believe in telepathy. Yeah. It's OK. I can't see well anyway. You can't? I told you I was taking a break. Actually I resigned from my position. I guess I'm sugar-coating it. What happened is... I was fired. Is that possible? They'll pretend that I died and then install a new leader. So it's a succession feud! I really could read minds. I thought my ability would help make a better world. Now I know that one man's not enough to make a difference. You learn something and you pass it on. That's how the world turns. OK, so I'll be your successor. OK. I'm coming. Let's see. It's slanting. See? Let's try again. Watch this, Teacher! What is it? What? Oh my God, you're floating! Your phone! Do it again. You did it! The phone you're calling has been switched off. It's the last day of camp. You have to come, Minami! Minami is in big trouble! Try to calm down please. Save her. You're Koteko mates? There's no suchh thing... Whatever! I'll talk to my brother and call you back. I'll wait. Talk to you soon. Call me! This is the voicemail service. Leave a message after the tone... "Assassination" Guys, you can go home! Why? But Teacher! "Used Books" Hi, Kid. What's up? Is Aki here? - He's hiking with a friend. That explains it. What's wrong, kid? You can tell me. Minami... I can't reach her. He might be involved in a dangerous conspiracy. - I'll save her! - You? Aki's not even a private eye but he found Minami's dad. "Waragai Clinic" "Waragai Clinic” Can you guess how? Can you guess how? An old man like me should stay out of this but... Abori Shiatsu Massage "Closed today” "Minami Sakuta" What am I doing? Moji? Why are you here? Miyaji was panicking because you didn't join the camp! So I panicked too. My phone died in the sea. Are you two dating? Don't be silly! I came here to see you! Come on, stay for dinner! But he reads minds... It's too scary. Hi, Minami. What's this? I bought it. Wanna go camping, it'll be sunny tomorrow! Uh... Hello. Moji is my friend. Hello. I see. So you're the private investigator's brother? He didn't use ESP... It's your name. Come in. Thank you. Not there. The house. Come on. I'll shower. Make yourself at home. Wait! Come here. Yes sir! Now I let it simmer. Oh, I don't need the knife. A drink? Thank you but no thanks. Alright. Here we go. Drink it. Come on. - Why? - Because! Because you'll take Minami away from me. No, a mutual friend asked me to come... Thank you. You two look alike. You and Minami. Me? Really? Do you know her stepfather? No. Well, yes. They look alike? No, they don't look alike. Right. I knew that they wouldn't. Forget it. It's nothing. I ended up taking a bath... You're drunk! We had talk, man to man. What? Are you OK? Your strokes are distinctive, Dad. That's way you should have writter the talismans... Sorry but... Please don't call me Dad. Even Minami hasn't called me that. Sorry, Dad. He's drunk. I'm not. I'm not. Another one! Stop that! Moji, don't. What are you doing? - That's good. - You wrote "Moji"? I love how round they are. Don't be weird... And Miyaji was crying. It isn't easy being a captain... So I have to stay over at her place. Minami won't be back tonight. She won't? Mom? I'll keep this then. My massage level is high Not now! I can't hear her. "Minami" Yeah. OK. Corrall Bye, Mom. You like this boy, Minami? What? You do...? Do you? You don't have to answer. You're wrong! I was in the sea... then he turned up. And I got all mixed up inside. Poor girl! Don't worry, Minami. You'll be OK no matter what. Because your mom and stepdad raised you to be able to deal with anything. I appreciate that. You've grown up, Minami. And now you like a boy... It's good. By the way, there's curry. Listen. I'm going tomorrow. I see. Thank you for visiting me. No, thank you, Dad. I'll reheat the curry. Come on, Jinko Quickly! Before she leaves. There she is. "Thank you for your lessons" I'am honored.

Sorry but I watched it. - How could you? - I couldn't wait! You scared me! What is it? Come with me. What's up? So where were you? I won't get mad. He's aged! Me too, I guess. He said that too. Was it fun? I know it was. Did you talk? About what? Things. We went to the beach. Ate dinner and... I'm sorry. What for? For lying? Or for... having a good time? For lying. Remember when you got that talisman... You didn't ask questions. I guess... You tried to protect us in your own way. From now on no more lies. Can I visit him? I's O.K. Corral! It's a very hot summer. Watch out for heat stroke. Capeesh? Wrap it up, Captain. We had a good camp. Yes, Captain. And as Sakuta was absent, she will do laps and chores. Dismissed. - Capeesh? - Yes! Thank you, coach! Miyaji, where's the brush? It's out! “Moji" Gravel, gravel! No. Whatever I do is uneven. Gravel, gravel! Hi, Concrete. Chichibu! Cement has alkaline so it'll damage your hands!

"Payment balance: 0 yen" "When you grow up, use your money to help someone.” It was free. Is that OK? I don't know but if he says so. Can I watch. Okay... Sorry but I feel self-conscious if you watch. Sure. Moji, I... Moji, I... I don't know why I'm laughing! Moji, I... Moji, I... Oh no! - I'm not laughing at you. - I know. - Moji, I... OK, calm down. - Moji... - Calm down. How's that? I like you. I like you, Moji. I like you a lot. Me too. Me too. I like you too, Minami. Why... Why are you crying...? I feel like I have value. You do have value. You have a lot of value too, Minami. And I'll live to prove it. Why do you sound so confident? Minami, you're beautiful. I like you. Me too. Oh no. I'm losing my mind! Why am I crying? You're floating, Uncle! You're floating! You're floating! God only. gives us hardships that we'can handle I know that's what people say but here you are, you fought all alone Just remember this, if you feel broken A wall is not something to get over but to plaster over with your magic wishes It's all within the heart of a plasterer You and I together we'll plaster walls And don't tell God what we do Koteko, Koteko!
