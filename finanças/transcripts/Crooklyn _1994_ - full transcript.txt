Gem, the money will come. I'm waitin'. I'm back teachin' school again and I am waitin', Woody. You just keep doin' what you're doin', Gem. Now, you know it wasn't always like this. I made money before, I'll make money again. I trust you, but you have got to realize... we are on a limited budget. I am trying to balance everything. And when you go and write checks and don't tell me about it, It makes it extremely difficult. As God is my witness, I want the best for you and the children. But I have got to do it in my own way. Cool? Cool. I went out and opened a separate bank account. That supposed to get some kind of reaction from me? Just what is that supposed to prove? I don't know what it proves.

You can get up off my chair. I don't want to talk about your mistakes. Now, you keep track of those. I don't have time. All I ask you to do... is to write down when you spend the money that I am making. I done told you it was a legitimate mistake. I... I appreciate that but you have made that mistake five times this month, Woody. I just want you to change the pattern. I don't need no lecture from you about how to conduct myself in this house. I'm not giving you a lecture. I am asking you... to help me conduct the business affairs of this family. - What the hell do you think I am trying to do? - You're an adult! I don't know what you're doing. I know you don't! But let me tell you, I got to be like a thief in the night in this house, every time I want to get some privacy to do my work. You selfish child! Don't tell me about privacy. Selfish nothing! Selfish nothing! Yes! You are selfish. I can't even take a piss without six people hanging off my tits! You a big saint around here, and I ain't shit, is that it? You call yourself what you want to. I just asked you to write down the check. I'll note the check right now. I'm gonna note this check. I think you can do two things at once. Make music and write. Woody... wrote... a bum check. - Here. - That's very cute. You remember to write it down before it bounces next time. You know, you seem to forget, I'm the one who used to pay for you and the children... to go to Bloomingdale's and Lord and Taylor, to get what you wanted, when you wanted. You ain't the only one contributed to this family, Gem. You got to remember that. That's a foul! I know, right? - Where the referee? - Clinton! Clinton! What? Don't answer me "what?"

Vic Powell didn't slap him this time. Your father was there, thank God. Wendell had been telling me that every morning Tony throws trash from his sidewalk... onto our stoop. Well, we finally caught him red-handed. What the hell you think you're doin'? I'm throwing this trash back. Who told you to throw it here in the first place? How do you know it was us? You do that to your own stink house, man. I know exactly what happened. You're the one who's always throwin' garbage. You know how it is on our block. A little shouting starts. Before you know it, you got a big crowd wantin' a big show. Wendell, what's goin' on? We caught him throwin' trash over there. I expect more from a grown man. What do you think you're doin'? Your children are constantly over here throwin' their trash on my property. - True. - And furthermore, they go on the roof... and throw rocks down on my dogs. - Untrue. - Machine gun, machine gun, machine gun! Are you doing this? Are you gonna believe this man? Yeah, you gonna believe this stinky over us? My children are doing no such thing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You should start actin' like an adult and cut this foolishness out. Tony, I hate to tell you this, but your house stinks. That's the truth. That's just the reality. Why you house stink, man? Hey, you up there. Hey, Mister Number 4. Mira, Mira. Where's my rent? When you gonna pay the rent? Now Tony, you want me to, I'll come over. I'll help try to straighten up, but this situation got to stop. I smell your animals all in my house. You understand me? Okay. Here. Aren't you glad to be away from these crazy people in Crooklyn, New York? And now, about your father. It started with Clinton. You're the eldest. I expect more from you, but I'm gonna let you make your own decision. Man, why did Daddy have to have his concert tonight, the night of the NBA championships? - Dang! - Which is more important? All right! Nice! Was that some new stuff tonight, brother? Yeah, man. You ought to record it, Woody. I plan to. I also started working on my folk opera. Folk opera? About what, Woody? What you laughin' at? Jessica was laughing. She's from the city. My folk opera is about me growin' up in Alabama. All right. You got the material for it. You know that's right. Doin' it right! We were all trying very hard to lift your father's spirits. And it was working, until: The Knicks are world champs. We got some ice cream and cake right here. Clinton. I'm not hungry. And the Knicks won. How 'bout that? I've enclosed some gifts for you and Viola. Ladybug, we all miss you dreadfully. I miss you. Love, Mommy. We got the lights turned back on, thanks to Uncle Brown, who is also buying your plane ticket home. - Please write and thank him... - "Please write to him and thank him immediately." Queenie! I don't know where she's run off to. - Well, here she is, the birthday girl. - These are for you. - Thank you. - Did your mother send you those? Mm-hmm. They're jade. Oh. Aren't they pretty! What are they? Little elephants? Look, Mama. Aunt Carolyn sent me some also. Oh, well, Viola, you don't have pierced ears. - You know how I feel about that. - But Troy has pierced ears. Well, Troy was also wearin' them funny... braids and beads and shells and things. - You don't ever let me do what I want to do. - I want to go home. - Beg pardon? - I'm going home. Now, Troy, no need to get upset. Everybody has a little argument now and then. Uh, your Aunt Song didn't mean nothin' about your hair and your earrings. - Did you, honey? - I don't care! - See what you did? - Lord, have mercy. Troy! How would it look if you left now? Aunt Song has a big mouth sometimes. You want your folks to think we done scared you back up North? If she goes, I go. Troy, Aunt Song loves you and your family. Clem, do something! Now, look, folks. Troy wants to go home, Troy's goin' home. That's all there is to it. Troy? At least stay for the birthday party I've prepared. Song. Fix us some breakfast. All right. Queenie! Queenie! Queenie, where are you? - Oh, Lord, have mercy. - Come on back in here. Where is my baby? Queenie! Where are you? Jesus, Master, where is my child? Queenie! Queenie, where are you? Queenie? Where are you, baby? Stop that! Please! - Did you find her, Mama? - I just don't understand where my baby is. It's not like Queenie just to up and disappear. Why, Lord, why? She'll be back, Aunt Song. Don't worry, Mama. Queenie will show up. It's gettin' late, y'all. Everybody have enough ice cream and cake? - Yes. - Everybody brush their teeth and wash their hands? - Yes. - All right, help me pull this bed out then. Come on. Move! Move! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Pick up the pillow. Viola, help her with the pillows. Get out of here, Judy, Jody... Whatever your names are. Oh, God! Oh, dear God! Oh, God, take me right now. I don't want to live anymore without my baby. Queenie! Oh, God! Queenie! Looks like it's gonna rain. That means that my baby is in heaven. Troy, I'll go get your bags. Bye, Aunt Song. I'm sorry about Queenie. Maybe you could come stay with me sometime. I'd like that. Bye, Queenie. Sorry you got squashed to death in the sofa, even though I hated your guts. Let her go, Viola.

She didn't want to ride? Naw, she was busy. - What happened to your hair? - Aunt Song didn't like my braids, and she took 'em out. Oh, goodness gracious. Carolyn Carmichael's gonna have a fit when she sees this, huh? Well, you ready to go? Mm-hmm. - Has Woody been there all day? - Since this mornin'. So you were ready to come on home, Troy, huh?

What's wrong with her? We don't know yet, Troy. The doctors are running tests. How come she didn't tell me? How come nobody told me? Because no one wanted you to worry yourself silly, and your mother didn't think there was any cause for alarm. Where's Daddy? He's in there with your mother. Hey! Miss Coomish Mimmish! Hi, Daddy!
