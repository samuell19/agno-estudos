Based on C. Gavat's life 96 hours in police custody Was Antoine Cervoni murdered, or did the president's former adviser kill himself in his office at the Interior Ministry where he'd recently been made Senior Defence Official. The official version, according to which Cervoni committed suicide, contains many factual errors and untruths. Although the police reports substantiate the suicide theory, the deceased's family's lawyers claim the investigation was flawed. Why are you up? It isn't time for school yet. I wanted to recite my poem. Come here. Don't you want to recite it tonight? No. I wait for you every night and you never come. I don't do an ordinary job. Baddies come out at night. It isn't my fault. What's the poem? The Lament of the Little White Horse. - Who's it by? - Paul Fort. "The little horse 'mid winter's height, "ah, what a gallant heart he bore He was a little pony white "all behind and he before. "He was a little pony white, all behind and he before. "He never saw the Spring arise to gild the dreary landscape o'er "He never saw the sunny skies, either behind or before, "He never saw the sunny skies, either behind or before, "He was contented evermore drawing the village lads "Through the rain's unceasing pour, all behind and he before. "Through the rain's unceasing pour, all behind and he before. "His little cart behind him went, chasing the jaunty tail he wore, "It was then he was content, all behind and he before. "It was then he was content, all behind and he before. "But one day, beneath..." Don't move, honey. Go on. - Go see Mum. - Police! Go upstairs! What the hell's going on? - Out the way! - Don't shove! Couldn't you have simply asked him to come in? The circumstances demanded it. You're not paid to judge just to produce results. DAY ONE Chief Superintendent Internal Affairs What's so amusing? Name, date and place of birth, please. It's all in my file. Look at it and copy it. I'd change your tone if I were you. The situation is hardly very welcoming, but I would ask you to remain courteous. Courteous? Turning up at my home at 6am with cops in balaclavas, who cuffed me in front of my family, is being courteous? - Why am I here? - You're implicated in a case of corruption, criminal association and drug trafficking. - Is that all? - That's all. Name, date and place of birth? Blain, Willy, CÃ©sar, Lucien, born on October 6, 1961 in Bordeaux, to Henri and Georgette Legrand. Belt, laces, jewellery, put them in here. I know the ropes. Forget the rest, son. If you want to strip me, you'll need back-up. How about a finger about your arse? - What are you doing here? - Same as you. They've also hauled in Rossi and D'Angelo of the Drug Squad. - Do not communicate. - What's your name? - Samir. - How old are you? 24, sir. - When did you start? - A year and a half ago. A year and a half ago? Good luck, Samir. Don't worry, Willy. They need to make some noise, so they're squeezing us. It'll soon blow over. See you tomorrow at noon for a drink. Where are we going? - Brussels. - What are we going to do there? Karim screwed up a job. They did a ram raid on a jeweller's. The cops attacked them. - Where is he? - Hiding in a car park. One guy is dead, the other's in a bad way. What's it got to do with us? It was a close thing. Take this. What about my mate? I can't take him like that. It's too risky. Will it be the same for a shit? Sorry, sir. It's the same for everyone. Yeah, right! What time is it? 1:22pm. Take care of her. Get a female colleague to search her. And put her in solitary. Who is she? Blain's mistress. To be handled with caution. Sugar? No. Do you want to eat something? I can get a tray sent up. I'm fine. I examined your file very carefully. Top of your year, exemplary conduct, medal for bravery, injured twice on duty and a record number of busts in the region. The latest assessment from your superior, Chief Superintendent Philippe Jansen: "Dynamic, intelligent element, with faultless conduct, "who, by inspiring a sense of duty in his men, "has made his team one of the CID's best units." What did you do to him to get such praise? What do you think? How long have you been with your husband? Nearly 15 years. Did you know about his affair with this woman? - No. - Is this the first time? I've no idea. How has he been recently? Same as usual: absent. Did he ever mention who he saw or what he did? To talk, you have to see a person. Surely you have time together? Before screwing other women, he screwed the police. For any personal questions, I suggest you ask him. Look, madam, your husband is implicated in... I don't give a damn. I just want to go home to my children. Change your tone and answer my questions. On November 13, acting on information from a protected source, at 3:47pm you and your unit stopped a "go-fast" convoy at the interchange between the A43 and the A432. According to your report, there should've been 300kg of cocaine in the boot of the BMW 740i registered in Germany, which was transporting the drugs. But your report states you only found 40kg of those 300kg. Correct. The driver of the BMW, Said Larbi, when questioned by the investigating judge, said there were 60kg of cocaine in the boot, and not 40, as your report says. He's lying. There were 40kg. My men will confirm that. You mean Captain Rossi, Lieutenants Batz and D'Angelo, and Captain Ayache? On the drug weighing report, there are only two names: yours and Philippe Jansen's. Was any other officer present at the weighing? No. In other words, between a dealer who's making things worse for himself by saying he was actually transporting more drugs and the statements of two officers with unorthodox methods, it's the two police officers I should believe? I think so, yes. You could even ask yourself how many times they have risked their lives to dry up the drug market. All I'm asking myself is what you did with the other 20kg. In recent months, have you noticed any odd transactions on your bank accounts? Large sums of money credited or debited, for instance. Did your husband usually have a lot of cash on him? How did he pay? I don't know. Like I said, we rarely saw one another. You have a nice life. A home like yours, the Jeep, the Porsche, the horses. How did you pay for it? The house was paid for with a mortgage. The horses are my job. The 4WD was my father's and we bought the Porsche for 13,000 euros. Half the price of your car, huh? I'm allowed to let you go after this interview. Your husband will be staying the night. Do you want to say goodbye? Goodbye. - Hi. - Hello. Hello. Hi, pet. Here... Stash this. Thanks. - Honey! - Here I am. I'll never forget your help. I won't forget either, Karim. Without us, you'd have been nabbed. One favour deserves another. I know. Well? - Well what? - Give me some food. - You wanna eat? - Yes. 300kg of coke. It's arriving from Punta Cana on a jet. From Versailles, it'll be taken by "go-fast" to Lyon. - When? - Day after tomorrow. - Who told you? Raouf Chelli. It's his order. If he finds out you grassed, he'll rip out your tongue. I don't give a toss. I'm not scared of him. Hang on, excuse me. Don't sulk! It's nice here. What are you playing at? He shot a guy! So what? One less crook, and a great case for us. That's all that matters. Come on, relax! What are you looking at? Do you like her? She's new, she just arrived. Noella. Her bloke's been inside for 3 years. She's well horny. Come on. - What is it? - Pig's trotters. It wasn't deliberate. Got a cigarette? Yes, sure. Keep the pack. Thanks. Right, well, enjoy your meal. Did you imagine your job'd be like this? - Where are you from? - Nice. How d'you end up here? Bottom of the class. So I didn't really have a choice. - Plan to do this for life? - I'm studying to be an officer. - This is just for now. - Any diplomas? Master's in law and a BA in politics. So why the police? Actually, my granddad was a cop, so was my dad, and my brother's a cop. So... I'm doing the same. I have to go. I'm not really allowed to talk to you. - Call if you want a light. - Thanks, Samir. Despite their many enemies among those they pursued and frequented, they built a close network of contacts enabling them to have access to first-rate information and guaranteeing them a remarkable success rate. These arrests reopen the debate on the legitimacy of certain excesses in the police, excesses linked to the special relationship too many police officers have with criminals in order to do their job. Here's the head of Internal Affairs, Chief Superintendent Joseph Dahan. Although this scandal reveals the flaws of the system, it's a victory for those who do their job by the book and those who believe in an upright and honest force. I promise to eliminate all the parasites who, through their criminal... Yes. I know, Dad, I'm watching it. But Dahan is a shit. You know, you worked with him. It's to bury the Cervoni affair. Everyone's playing along, including me. What else can I do? I know, Dad, you already told me. I'll call you back. DAY TWO Come on, wake up! The judge wants to see you. Can I have a wash? You're not going to a dance! Yes. This is Judge Vojak, who is heading the investigation of which you and Jansen are the subjects. I wished to inform you myself of the extension of your custody. It is evident, following your initial statements, there are many grey areas to be cleared up in this case, in particular your relationship with the young prostitute, Noella. - She's a hostess not a prostitute. - What's the difference? A hostess sleeps with men she's attracted to. She was the mistress of a criminal who's just been released after serving 5 years for a holdup and attempted murder. You're going to say it's to be as close as possible to the crooks you pursue? That's right. Where do I sign? And the conditions of your detention? There isn't a sea view. And what's this? Why detain my wife? She isn't involved. It's between us cops. And judges wishing to shed light on unacceptable practices. Those practices enabled you to further your career. A good cop gets results. And there's only one way: put your hands in shit and stir so something comes out. There's shit stirring and landing yourself in it. It's hardly the same thing. If you think stealing drugs and hanging out in clubs with crooks and prostitutes is a way of doing good, then we don't have the same idea of how to do this job. That's likely. Tell me about Noella. How did you meet her? - Not going to cuff me today? - Would you like that? According to our sources, you met her in a club on the Champs-ElysÃ©es, the Cindy Club. Correct? One of her friends introduced you. A regular, Karim Beloufa. Is that correct? I don't remember. Will these jog your memory? The Cindy Club has been under surveillance for a year. Our officers took the photos. As well as being a well-known base for the capital's crooks and even some from Lyon and Grenoble, a well-informed source told us it was also popular with some high-ranking Parisian police officers, who hang out there with women of questionable morals who keep dubious company. Which is why our department set up the surveillance. If you already know, why ask me? To find out if you're a liar. You don't seem to realize how serious this situation is. It isn't about sex between a cop and a whore. It's a drug trafficking case. 20kg of cocaine that you and Jansen are suspected of having taken to pay your criminal friends including Karim Beloufa, who is wanted for robbing a jeweller's in Brussels and suspected of killing his accomplice, Mr Sahraoui, who was found with 2 bullets in his head in a carpark. Come with me. You're allowed to take me out of my cell? What if I leg it? Where would you go without your ID? We have all your stuff. What do you want? - For you to tell me. - To tell you what? I dunno. What went on between Blain, Jansen and Beloufa. About the nature of their relationship. You reckon I'm gonna tell you what I didn't say at the station? You've wasted a breakfast for nothing, love. I'd rather give you a blowjob than grass people up. It was to help you, to get you out of 3 years inside. I'm not going inside. I just slept with a cop. It isn't a crime. He's suspected of drug trafficking and being an accessory to murder. My enemies' friends are my enemies. He goes down, you go down with him. Even if I wanted to talk, I don't know anything. With Will, it was just for fun, it wasn't business. - What about the coke? - You're gonna hassle me for 2g? - Did he take it with you? - I was his coke. He hadn't screwed his wife in years. You know all about that. Listen carefully, you. You might be a great fuck but you're nobody. Just a little whore who had the wrong cop. OK? Wipe your face! This is no ordinary case you're mixed up in. We need culprits at all costs. Either you talk or you'll end up inside. So you never met Karim Beloufa other than in the Cindy? He was just an acquaintance, not a friend. You knew he was wanted in several countries for international drug trafficking. We didn't discuss everything. I understand your wish to protect your informers. You should think about it. In less than 70 hours, it'll be too late. Come in. How's our case going, Superintendent? Rossi, D'Angelo and Blain's wife were released after questioning. Blain denies everything, Jansen refuses to be questioned. - And the whore? - Moreau's on her. Not too much, I hope. Don't make that face. You knew it'd be complicated. Those guys are CID veterans. They know the rules of the game. You have to be smarter. Catherine, the police doesn't act with feelings but with convictions. Convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than lies. That's Nietzsche. Nietzche was a poor syphilitic lunatic. How can you give credit to a man who said Parsifal was compatible with the decline of German art? They've been there 2 days... in the cold. We have to give them what they expect. Don't count on me. I'm going to try to shed light on this case, but not like that. - Don't try to shed light. Shed it. Will, look at me. You OK? You OK? Will, look at me. Look at me! Willy! Willy, look at me. Are you OK? Will? Here... Come on. You gave us a real fright, pal. An ambulance is on its way. They'll check you out. It's OK, I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Why did you throw yourself at their car? You're crazy, Willy. One day you're gonna kill yourself. Here, I found it in the ditch. Sure you're OK? I'm fine, don't worry. Two kids. The driver doesn't even have a licence. What was in the car? Barely a 3rd. We've been screwed. - There isn't even 60kg. - What does that mean? It means Karim tricked us. What you fucking up to? Come on! Come here! Stop! Stop! I don't like being screwed, Karim! If I intercept a "go-fast", it isn't for nothing. What do you mean? There wasn't even 60 kg! How d'you explain that? Hey, I didn't know! They must've changed plans. I've always been straight with you. - Why would I screw you? - Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! I'll never screw you. Never. OK, OK, enough. - Enough! - I didn't screw you. Just go home, pack your bags and leave the area. You've gotta hide. It was a lure, to see if you'd grass. Now they know. What am I gonna do? I'm broke. I took 5kg for you. It's in the boot. You can make a fresh start. Join us upstairs. It isn't necessary. When did you last see Beloufa? - 2 or 3 months ago. - Where? I already told you. - At the Cindy Club? - Yes. Who were you with? Why all these questions? Karim Beloufa vanished on November 13, the day you and Jansen intercepted the "go-fast" convoy. He hasn't been seen at any of the nightclubs he frequented. His family and friends haven't been able to explain his sudden disappearance. And he hasn't been seen at any of his usual haunts. It isn't the first time a crook has disappeared. Beloufa wasn't an ordinary crook, he was your and Jansen's informer. Why "was"? His body was found in the boot of an abandoned car less than an hour ago. It would appear he was tortured then executed. 3 bullets in the neck. I hope the ballistics experts don't find the gun used belonged to you or Jansen. Are you mad? You think we'd kill a crook, and with one of our guns too? I don't think anything. All I know is, the last two people seen with him were you and your friend Jansen. Drug trafficking, corruption, criminal association and now voluntary manslaughter. If you want me to confess, extend my custody. Change your tone, Superintendent. Your custody has already been extended. And if you are involved in any way with Beloufa's murder, I'll make sure you don't get off lightly. I bought them for you. Your favourite brand, huh? A year of surveillance has to have its uses. Even my wife doesn't know. What else do you know? Lots of things. Thank you. You know, for years, I was praised because I got results. No one among the top brass ever bothered to find out how I got those results. They just took their medals and slowly climbed the ladder while staring at their toes. And now, all of a sudden, there's a moralistic wind blowing in the plush offices of these gents. They have looked up, opened their eyes and feigned outrage while sitting in the ministry. It makes me want to puke. No one's fooled, dear Mrs Van Roy. If you expect me to show remorse, you're in for a long wait. Because I'm proud to be a cop. Humiliate me all you like, back the dirty tricks of the judge and those who've organised this farce with him, you won't strip me of my pride. It's worth more than shame and the hypocrisy of this shitty system. It's thanks to it I'm still standing. What time is it? 4:10pm. I'd like to call my children and wife. To reassure them. Is that possible? You can call from here. Thank you. We've got a problem in the cells. Noella Vicaire has slit her wrists. Stay here with him. Your wife's beautiful. Yes, she is beautiful. Don't go through my things. Do you often cheat on her? What difference does it make? Why do you cheat on her? Why do you prostitute yourself? I don't like men. But you love your wife, huh? I have to go. I'll call you. I don't like men but I'm fond of you. What does your man say? He's inside. He doesn't need to know. Ask forensics to send someone over. I don't know how she got a knife. Maybe it's the one she used in the cafe opposite. We'll discuss it later, Captain Moreau. Thank you. How is she? She'll survive but she needs intensive care. She's been taken by ambulance to hospital. Who is she for you? Do you love her? When you head a prestigious department and have sex with a prostitute, do you ever wonder whether it's going to get you into trouble? Yes. But you do it anyway. Why? Adrenaline. Lack of love, desire, I don't know. Take your pick. If you want to call home, you can do so now. You've reached the Blains. Please leave a message. Camille, it's me. I wanted to know how you all were. Please forgive me for all this... I'm truly sorry. Kiss the kids for me. Give them my love. I miss you all. I love you. Fucking hell! It's me they want. Keep quiet and it'll be fine. Please, gents! The drugs are a pretext. They want to hush up the Cervoni affair. - Enough! - They've got fuck all. - Please! - Yeah, right! They don't have a case, and they never will! Don't give up, Willy! Fucking vending machines! Here. Thank you. 9 hours! He refuses to come out. It's understandable. It's such a shitty world, he's better off in there. Right, this is cat's piss. - Do you smoke? - Yes. Want to go for a smoke? I'd love to. - Is it a boy or a girl? - We don't know. We already have a boy and a girl. Nice one! This is my first and my last. I'm too old for this. I'm Philippe. Willy Blain. Willy Blain, the cop? Jansen. I'm the head of the CIIS. I know. The 1st to have a baby buys the other a drink. OK? You're on. - How long have you been together? - I don't know. You give her 3 kids and you don't know? I don't care how long it's been! I'm happy. Do you know how long it's been? Oh yes. It's been... 22 years, 6 months... and 13 days. You're counting as if you were in the slammer! It feels like I am. Why d'you think I chose the anti-gang unit? I'm happier in a stake-out car than slouched on the sofa watching TV. - Why have a kid then? - Because... Because she wanted one. And I didn't have the balls to leave. Come on. To my son and your daughter. Milo, can we have the same again? - No, I've had enough. - Come on, don't be a pain. If I said I'd only ever touched my wife, would you believe me? We met at 17 and got married at 20. Then we spent 22 years trying to have a kid. The docs said it was impossible. Then, all of a sudden, bam! I'm a dad. A dad at 40, unbelievable, huh? - Thanks. - Put it on his bill. - He lost. - Only by 10 minutes. 10 minutes is 10 minutes, mate. You're 10 minutes late for a bust, you're fucked. What does your lady do? Breeds horses. - So you're loaded? - No. It's a small stud farm, a family business. And yours? She waits. She waits for me to come home and I don't want to... I love my job basically, more than my wife, than anything. If you don't like it, you shouldn't do it. I need a deputy in my unit. Apply if you're interested and I'll take care of it. Did I say something wrong? No. Then welcome to the anti-gang unit, mate. I'll ask you one last time. Do you confirm there was 40kg of cocaine, and not 60, as Said Larbi said, in the "go-fast" car that you intercepted on November 13 at 15:47pm, at the interchange between the A43 and the A432? I do. Do you also confirm that you never took any of the drugs to pay one or several of your informers? I do. Hi, Will, it's me. I need a favour. Is there anyone in the office with you? I'm alone, go on. I need you to take another 15kg. I know it's a lot, but it's urgent. It's for one of my narks. - I swear it's worth it, Will. - When do you want it? I'll come by tonight. Thanks, you're a pal. We know where the 15kg went. That leaves 5. What did you do with them? Snort them or sell them? How long were you listening? I never gave the drugs to Jansen. I didn't follow through. I smelt trouble. - Don't take the judge for a jerk! - It's the truth though. Captain Ayache was there. He dissuaded me. Just ask him. Captain Ayache is on a mission abroad. We've tried to reach him several times. He must have heard about your predicament and is playing dead out of solidarity. I believe you stole 20kg from the boot of the car. You put 15 aside to help your superior, as he'd asked you to... and you gave the other 5 to Beloufa for services rendered. I'll let you do the maths. Sorry, I had a meeting in a new girly bar. I lingered a bit. Fucking pain. 2 hours! It's my wedding anniversary. I'll get grief again. - She shouldn't be with a cop. - Yeah, right! A ton of heroin is worth 15kg of coke, isn't it? Who told you? The bird of one of the mules. A useful fuck. - You seeing other women? - I've aged. You're a big boy, but I'm not happy. Don't be a pain, Will! Superintendent Jansen, please. 3 days without a woman. You're taking huge risks. It isn't in your interests to make things worse, Mr Jansen. You can call me Philippe. Nor is it advisable to stay holed up in this cell and stubbornly refuse to be questioned. It's not the best tactic with Judge Vojak. Screw Judge Vojak! Just take responsibility as head of the unit. It could save those who were just obeying your orders. You're a courageous man. It isn't like you to take the crew down too. I can only confess if I did wrong. You have no proof. I have the recording of a conversation between you and Blain. Sure it's me? Don't take me for an idiot. Your phone's been tapped for over a year. Your home, your office, your car, your mobile, the lot. Listening to your conversations and those of most of your acquaintances, you're no cop, you just have the badge. What we say on the phone and what we do isn't necessarily the same thing. Phone tapping has never constituted legal proof. It can just be used to support a case. Now get out of my cell. I've heard enough from you. I'm done. Take him back to his cell. Your men had it delivered. It's forbidden usually, but as it's you... Good luck! We're with you. The 54th. Given the gravity of the facts, Judge Vojak has extended the custody of the 2 heads of department implicated in this case, Superintendents Philippe Jansen and Willy Blain. Questioned for 72 hours at the Internal Affairs Paris HQ, the two officers had to explain the disappearance of 20kg of cocaine... Why did you switch it off? Aren't you interested? - They're talking rubbish. - Why is he still being held then? - Well, I'm interested. - Stop! - I'm going to watch it. - Lucas, you... Give it to me! - What's your problem? - Everything! Know what they say at school? That he fucks whores, sells drugs and he's a bent cop. I've fought twice today because of him. So I want to know if he's worth fighting for. Don't talk like that in front of your sisters. How's my girl? - What are you doing here? - He recognized you. Hello, Dad. He's been pining for you for 3 days. He obviously has things to say. Don't be silly. You came from Dijon for that? When you love you don't count the cost. It's because of Blain and Jansen, isn't it? Want to talk somewhere else? - What's so special about them? - Passion. Passion is no excuse. It's the difference between a good cop and a shit like Dahan. I know his methods, I've spent time with him. - I know what he's capable of. - So? His hushing up the Cervoni scandal means Blain and Jansen are clean? They were only doing their job, as I taught them to do. That's right, my girl. I was their instructor at the police academy. If you had read their files, you'd have known. I had them both 5 years apart. They were among the best... natural-born police officers. From the start, I knew they'd make great cops. They had something in common: that look in their eyes... The CID's their life, investigation's in their blood. They're true criminal hunters. I taught them the ropes, the ins and outs, the tricks. I also taught them... how not to fall. They obviously didn't remember the whole lesson. What are you trying to say? They became like that because of you? I made good cops of them. And I'm proud of it. I'm tired of good cops being shot at point-blank range. It's necessary, Dad. A good cop must be an example. That's what I was taught. What's a good example? Taking the risks they've taken for 20 years to bring down the biggest gangs around or sitting comfortably at your desk and crapping on them, like those whose careers they made? Don't pick the wrong target, love. Blain and Jansen aren't crooked. Just cops with their methods. Just because these methods are questionable today is not enough to put them behind bars. If you condemn them, you condemn me too. You've no right to say that. Give my grandson my love. Come on, you. Out you go. - What's this? - Well, in South America, there are freshwater fish that eat people. Did you know? They're called piranhas. These cowboys have put a sick cow in the river. While it's being eaten by the piranhas, they take the rest of the herd around this way. That way they won't be eaten. It sucks. What's wrong, Mum? I have to go back to work. We'll be together tomorrow. That's a promise. I love you. Marion, I have to go back to work. Could you stay over? No problem. Don't you worry. - Thanks. Have a good evening. - Bye. If you want to get a drunken confession out of me, you'll need more than a bottle. I know you're a hard drinker, I wouldn't risk it, don't worry. I got the most expensive bottle. I hope it's good. Tell me what I owe you. Just a good answer and we'll be quits. The name of the person the 60kg of coke belonged to. - How would I know? - Answer my question. What'll you do with it? His name's Raouf Chelli. A big shit from La Grande Borne in Grigny. Had for drug trafficking, GBH, gang rape and attempted murder. Imagine Chelli hears one of his stooges meets you just before a big delivery. What d'you think he'd do? What those bastards do for whom a life means no more than a gob of spit. Maybe he was smarter for once. Right... He tells Karim Beloufa he's arranging a "go-fast" with a huge delivery. He lets Karim tip you off. Then he puts 60kg of coke in a car, which you rush to intercept, and transports the big delivery without any hassle. He has the proof Karim grassed and has him killed. It's the sick cow principle. Do you know where Chelli stashes his drugs? There are several possibilities. I'll tell you for another glass. What's your perfume? Answer my question and I'll tell you. According to our sources, it's at a babysitter's in La Peupleraie in Grigny. For more info, ask my drug squad guys. They'll give you the address. It's blackberry and musk. My perfume is blackberry and musk. It's artisanal. I'm really sorry you've got into this mess. And I'm sorry about how it's been handled. Did you really have to make a fuss and serve us up to the press? Telling us off in private would've been enough. We'd have quit our shit and gone back into action. Instead of being scapegoats. What do you mean by "quit our shit"? You know very well what I mean. The top brass knows, our ministers... Everyone knows. It's a war out there. We're expected to use catapults and the code of ethics against guys with guns, who film us while we're being shot at. Where's the truth in all this? With those who put up a token resistance to preserve democracy or with those bastards who raise hell? No one must break the law, certainly not a cop. We acted to serve and protect, never for personal gain. You think if you give a nark 500 euros, he'll tip you off? A nark needs more. He lives like a crook. He'll give a lot if he gets a lot. He doesn't want to be on the payroll or have his name on record. If you give seized drugs to an informer, they'll be sold again. Have you thought of that? I do every time, but we have no choice. Am I disturbing you? I see you have some wine. Are you waiting for the nibbles? We were discussing how hard it is to do our job. And? And I'd like to go back to my cell. I thought I could trust you. I was mistaken. It's the only way to get him to talk. You think if you give a nark 500 euros he'll tip you off? A nark needs more. He's crook with a crook's lifestyle. He'll give a lot if he gets a lot. You'll have my report on your desk tomorrow. DAY FOUR Police! Police! Don't move. Turn round! Shut it! I spoke to the other units. Raouf Chelli did not resist being taken in. Two handguns were found during the search. A 9mm and a 11.43. One of them could be the gun used to kill Karim Beloufa. Excellent. Take everyone in and place Chelli in custody for drug trafficking and murder. I was out of line with the girl. It was to win her trust and get her to talk. She confirmed things. Blain and Jansen got information in exchange for services. Your information's worthless. It was obtained illegally. You acted outside the law and extremely recklessly. You're no different to the cops we investigate. I haven't written a damning report to avoid another scandal. But I'd like you to give me your transfer request so that you can leave your post after this inquiry. Internal Affairs doesn't need cops like you. Excuse me... What are you playing at? What right do you have to take over this operation? What right do you have to act as chief investigator in a case that falls under the purview of the CID alone? Who do you think you are, for God's sake? Things are enough of a mess already! Our job is to fight corruption within our own force. To effectively fight this corruption, we must behave discreetly. Carrying on openly with those you're after won't get you the best results, believe you me. 9 people brought in, 230kg of cocaine, 2 guns probably used in a murder, that's carrying on openly? The Minister of the Interior is harassing me for the result of an inquiry into 2 bent cops involved in a case that could damage for good our institution and put an end to our leaders' careers. So believe me, at this very moment, the minister couldn't care less how, why and with which gun a scumbag like Karim Beloufa was murdered. Don't oblige me to tell him you were over-zealous with your old CID pals. Just go and write your report about Blain's confidences and give the minister some good news. We'd have quit our shit and gone back into action. Instead of being scapegoats. What do you mean by "quit our shit"? Come in. You know very well what I mean. Remove his handcuffs then leave, please. Your custody release form. You will go before the judge this afternoon. Your information was correct. Raouf Chelli was found with a handgun that matched the one used to murder Karim Beloufa. And 230kg of cocaine were found at the babysitter's. I'd like to thank you. Don't mention it. A long time ago. I was in the car. The other cop was me. Get down! I usually drove. But he wanted to drive that day. I know, I know all the reports by heart. I even blamed you for years. You knew all along? What does it change? Here, have my number. A memento for you. For me, it's meaningless. What is it? A medal of honour. Make good use of it. Thank you, sir. Where's the truth in all this? With those who put up a token resistance to preserve democracy or with those bastards who raise hell? No one must break the law, certainly not a cop. We acted to serve and protect, never for personal gain. You think if you give a nark 500 euros, he'll tip you off? A nark needs more. He lives like a crook. He'll give a lot if he gets a lot. He doesn't want to be on the payroll or have his name on record. Forget what I said to you. You're staying, I'm leaving. Are you coping OK? I've got some bad news. Jansen has been detained. He's going to jail. - Huh? - Yes. He's been busted for the drugs and much more. He kept bad company and accepted gifts from unsavoury types. - Yes, I know. - There's worse. Your phone lines were tapped for months. They have information that can be used against you. Phone tapping evidence doesn't hold up in court. It enabled them to track your every move and find enough negative elements to justify these proceedings. Am I going down? Your case isn't as bad as Jansen's. Even though your escapades and your affair with that young whore for months made a lot of folk jealous, you're reproached for having obeyed orders, and thereby being indirectly involved in embezzling drugs. So now... blindly obeying orders or complicity for personal gain, you'll have to convince the judge. You had it coming to you. You thought you were untouchable because of your results, but you ended up making too much noise. And noise bothers people. They want a clean force in a "clean" nation. Plus the scandal of the Cervoni affair, which caught the world media's attention. They used you to mop up. Come on. Talk about justice! Thanks a lot! Where's Van Roy? I don't know, sir. She didn't say. Catherine, it's Dahan. Get your arse back in here and give me the fucking report before tonight, or I'll send you to the Aliens Office to search the arses of illegal Africans and Arabs. Mr Blain... following your hearing and the examination of the investigation conducted for the purposes of this case, you are being indicted for drug trafficking, active and passive corruption and criminal association. Criminal association? What's this bullshit? Sir, ask your client to moderate his language and keep his composure. You are temporarily relieved of your duties and released under court supervision. It is prohibited to meet any person involved in this case and to communicate with your former CID colleagues. Any infringement of this judicial decision, and you'll be joining your friend Superintendent Jansen in prison. Is that clear? Consider yourself lucky to get off in this way.
