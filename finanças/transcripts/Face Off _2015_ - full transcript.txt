Reporting, the target is in sight. Everyone, stay in position. - Wait for order. - Roger that. Boss! Khai is back. Did you see his wife? Are you done? I can see no one but my mom! - Shit! - Damn it! - You guys can never get anything done. - How can I carry these two? They're as heavy as a cow. You always leave the burdens for the youngest to bear. Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors? - One, two, three. - One, two, three. Hey, what are you doing here? I'm working. Why does it look like you are spying? - I'm a police. I'm looking for a thief. - What? Aunt Que is even poorer than me. What's worth to be stolen? - Is that you, Ti? - Yes. - What're you doing there? - I'm grazing my cow. Don't let the cow eat my vegetables. My cow doesn't eat your vegetables, but someone has trampled them. Hurry up. Go. Honey. Honey, you're back? What took you so long? I've been waiting for you. What happened to your face? No time to explain now. Pack your stuff and go with me, okay? I could see my grandma this time. Maybe I'm destined to suffer. Shit! Police, Boss! What? Police? - What are you doing? - Shit, I'm so done. Boss, this is too hard! Let's forget it! So Khai got into the police's trap. Who's following me? - Quoan. - Quoan. No way! Rock, paper, scissors. What's wrong with your phone? I couldn't call you. It was dead for a few days. I will fix it tomorrow. Khai, come out! Are you trying to hide from me? - What? - Shit. Hurry up! Follow me. - What is it? Where are we going? - Go! - Wait. - Hurry up! Stop! Police! You're under arrest for homicide. If you try to resist, we will pull the trigger. Trust me. - Uncle! My cow doesn't budge! - Okay. Get them! - Khai, come here! Come here! - Khai! Be careful! You... Police here! Who are you? Why are you here? Khai killed my friend. This is our job. Hurry up! Hurry up. Hop on first. - Go! - What are you doing? Don't take my husband away! Don't take him away! - Get off! - Please! Let me do it! Gosh, I'm done! God! How did you even end up there? Stubborn idiot! Stop! Get him! Surround this area. Stop! Look! Tarzan! I'm doomed. So cold, Boss. I don't know how to swim. Over there! Surrender. You have no way out. Khai! - Hey, don't push me, or I'll fall and die! - So scary! Let me... Shit! Damn it! I'm so screwed! I'm not Tarzan! What now? Go another way. Don't take a shortcut like him. Hey, want a ride? I think you're too tired to walk now. Come in! Today is definitely not a good day for you. I'm a psychic. I know what will happen to those who have the same senses as me. And I know you are misjudged, so I came to help, but I was late. Do you know what was gonna happen to me? Troubles will follow you for a long time. What? You don't believe me? Look behind, and you'll see. Miss. - Do you believe me now? - Run! Stop! Stop the car! Be careful! We gotta jump! Hurry up, Miss! - Are you okay? - Run! Go down there to see what's up. Yes, sir! Hurry up! I heard a sound ahead! How can we hurry with this shit? Sir, you want to hurry up, right? Let's leave him behind. Hey, asshole! How can you say that? Someday you would be in trouble, and I would leave you to die. He's right. We're a team. We have to stick with each other. We're human, not monsters. Don't worry. I won't leave you behind, no matter what happens. - Snake! - Let's leave him here! Help! Can you predict my future? I'm not a fortune teller. If I try, I still have to focus for hours. Now I'm too tired to do that. I'm just kidding. Going with you makes me feel safe. Don't rely on me. In this life, nothing is completely sure. - Miss! - Be careful! Run! Go to hell. Damn, he dived headfirst. - Don't let him get away! - Get him! Where can you run to? Go to hell! He took the hit! Go back! You're so dead! Where are you hiding? Be a man and face us! I know your husband has no criminal records. I have no clue why he killed the victim. Maybe because of greed, he wanted it all, or there might be some conflicts between them. We also suspect that your husband is a part of some criminal gang who has helped him escape in the last chase. The person who helped him used a fake licensed plate number. So we hope you cooperate and convince him to surrender to get extenuated. But if you try to cover for him, you will be subjected to the laws. I don't know where he is. But I believe my husband didn't do such a thing. We only know the truth when we can talk to Khai. Tons of things to do, and no one's helping us. - Oh, God. So tired. - We need to hire someone. Hi, there! Who are you looking for? Do you know anyone who's looking for a helper? We need one too, but do you know how to take care of tea trees? I can do anything. Then let's try for a few days. - If you do well, we will hire you. - Thank you! The number you have dialed is temporarily not available. Le Thanh Khai is a run-away killer. He's wanted. If you see him, please report to the nearest administration office. Or call the hotline 0909000000. Whoever covers for the criminal will be dealt with according to the laws. What? Hello? Come to my house immediately. The killer is here. What? What's with the four or seven seats? What? Taxi? Oh, God. Hello? Police? Come to my house now. The killer is here. If you don't come, he's gonna kill me. Why is it so hot today? Honey, I'm hungry. So hungry! We're so lucky to have you here helping us. Dedicated, active, and hard-working. Well, a lot of delicious vegetables today. - Hurry, get the rice for me. I'm starving. - Thank you. What's wrong with you? Why fill my bowl with vegetables? God! What's wrong with you? Hello? Please try to keep him there. We're on our way. There's something wrong with you today. You are acting strange. What's wrong? Why are you moaning? You're weird. What's wrong? What? Please, please don't kill us. I'm begging you. What? He's such a nice guy. He's a killer. - The police are looking for him. - Really? Oh, God. Please, we're good people. Please don't harm us. You're such a handsome guy. Hurry up! Faster! - Hey. Cheers! - Boss! Are you blind? The sand is all over my face! What are you doing? Stop! Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Shit! Damn you! How dare you! How dare you! - Shit! You're fired. - Shit! You guys want to rebel? You again? How dare you! Go to hell! Go to hell! Stop! Let me handle him. Go to hell! Slacker! Slacker! Got burnt for sure! Can't you stop sticking your nose in people's business? Hey, what would you do if you have money? Me? I would buy a convertible car. I will take my wife to sightsee and sunbathe like super rich guys do. How about you? Me? If I have money, I will fix the house for my wife. We will have a house full of kids. That's a happy life. Having one kid is already tough. If you have a bunch, they might have to go mining like us. Thang. What? Look! We found diamonds! Hey, they found diamonds! Let's go there to see! Where? Where's the diamond? This is diamond! - Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, move! Move away! - Where's the diamond? - Move away! - Move! - Hey, don't wet my shoes. How many pieces did you find? Only these? I saw a very big piece. I saw... No, there're only two pieces here. Yeah, only two. You can search if you want to. Open your mouth. God! What's this big brick? Boss, it's true. There are only two pieces. This asshole keeps a lot of bricks with him. Seems like you guys know what's good for you. Let's go. - Dismiss! - Keep your brick. - All right, go, everyone! Go back to work. - Can I see that brick? Hurry! What else is there for you to look at? - Yeah! - Yeah! - We're rich! Yeah! - We're rich! Anyone home? Hello? Anyone home? The door is open! Why would someone knock? - What's with the nice manners... - Hello. May I ask you something? Who are you? I'm lost. Can you give me something to eat? I don't have anything. And my husband will be home soon. Can you give me a glass of water, then? Hey. You can come inside. This is my husband's. You can eat. Slow down, it's hot. Honey, what are you doing? He just asked for some food. How dare you! You take guys home while I'm away, right? But I... I'll shoot you. Damn, where's the rope? My grandfather left me a crossbow without a rope. God! What to use now? I will kill you. You... I will kill you. How is he better than me? How is he better than me? He only has longer hair than mine. His face is full of scars. Oh, God, come on. Please stop, don't cause trouble! I'm scared! Hey, be careful! Are you okay? Please don't hurt him. He's a nice guy and won't hurt you. Forgive me! You like her? I've got enough of her. - You can have her. - You... What? What are you saying? He has gone. You are still of value. Of value? Go to hell! You got drunk and want to sell me to whoever you want to? I'm so mad. What do you think? You should find a bigger store. We don't have the facilities to check its authenticity. Besides, if it's real, we won't be able to buy it from you. - Okay, thanks. - You are welcome. How can I help you? My utmost happiness is taking you out every day. The longer I'm with you, the brighter my life is. Thank you! Hey, Miss. Here you are. - Hey. - What's wrong? - I'm a motorbike taxi driver. - So? Where's my money? - I forgot. - How could you forget that? Thank you! Nowadays, girls have a bad memory. If they are all like her, I will starve. - Excuse me. - What? Is there any motorbike taxi around here? Yes, me. I'm a motorbike taxi driver. - You don't look like one. - That's why I don't earn much. But that's okay, I'm VIP driver. VIP can't be the same as regular service, get it? - Where do you want to go? - Saigon. - What? Stop kidding! - I'm serious. Serious? This motorbike can't handle the journey to Saigon. You gotta take a stronger bike or sleeping bus, understand? I would get carsick and become a zombie once I reached the destination. - The price will be high. - How much? Three million? What? You agreed? Did I undersell myself? It's fine, as long as you bring me to Saigon. Wait. Just come here from the forest? Deep cleansing, please. Give me that. Give me that. What? Do you think I would reuse this? Leave it here, then put it in a trash bin later. Hop on! Why do I always meet strange people? When can we arrive if you ride slowly like this? Better late than having accidents. The need for high speed could have long-lasting consequences. - How many times have you been to Saigon? - This is my first time. Same here. What? So who will lead the way? God, as long as you have a mouth to ask. You are headstrong. Tired? We just started. If everyone is as civilized as myself, we don't need sweepers anymore. Life is hard. Sometimes we can never get what we want. Why? Because God has everything planned out. We can't be donkey and human at once. And a donkey can never be a human. But if we drink donkey's milk, they say, "You're as stupid as a donkey." I get that all the time. I rode a customer to a traffic light once, waited for 1,5 minutes, the green light was on, I looked back, and... gone. God decides everything. You can count electricity posts for fun. You'll know how hard it is to fix the pole in the ground. Can you stop talking? What for? Talking helps me stay awake when riding a long way. Everyone does that... Hey! What's that? Want to be a Spider-Man? My stomach hurts! Ask me to slow down first. If you jump and die, I would be in prison, right? You're not civilized at all when taking a motorbike taxi. You might walk for the rest of your life. What now? Feels like I'm infected. My stomach is hurting too. Why did you bring your bike in here? What if I leave it there and someone borrows it forever? Hurry up! Hey, do you do this often? Very often. If I'd known how it feels, I'd also have done this often. Hey, this is the first time I do this while wearing a helmet. It's actually dangerous, huh? Dangerous how? What if a cobra suddenly appeared? Sorry. Listen, which one of you wants come to his wife's house? Me, I'm good at this. Boss, I think I'm suitable for this task. I'm handsome and fit, so I can attract women easily. Boss, I think I'm the most qualified. Hey! Qualified with these wounded legs? No, it has already fully recovered. Look! Your legs are still in pain. Boss, let me do it. I'll use my manhood to convince her. Boss, I understand women's psychology. Hey, I send you there to follow her, not to rape her. Why would everyone want to jump into this task, huh? Okay, I'll save my beauty to do other things. Boss, I think you are the most suitable one for this. You go! This is the first time I go to Saigon. I'm so excited. Yeah, Saigon is now very beautiful. No, I'm excited to take your money and then go back home. Hey, slow down. - What? Stomachache again? - Yes, it hurts. Come on. All right, now go faster. Hey, slow down. - Again? Why do you keep doing that? - Slow down, please. Your stomach should hurt for one time only, understand? If you keep being like that, the bike will be broken. Oh, God. Why is your stomach fuzzy like the weather? Who knows? Know what? Just don't eat junk food. There's a customer every time I go to the toilet. Excuse me, can you show me the way to Buon Me Thuot City? Drive straight to Dak Lak's center, then ask for the way there. What, did he show us the right way? You have to have faith. Thank you! Stop! Welcome to our newly opened restaurant. - Move away! I ate already! - Lots of nice food. Please come in. What's wrong? Your stomach hurts now? There're times we can't stand where the wind blows. - Done. - Civilized people are so different. I remember we haven't had anything. - Let's find something to eat. - Okay. I just bought them. Looks nice, right? Restaurants make huge profits. How much does this meal cost? Not much. Two bowls of vermicelli with grilled pork, two dishes of rice with grilled pork ribs, and soft drink, iced tea, and this... - Energy drinks. - Total is 500,000. - What? - What? What? Why so expensive? That's why I have money to buy gold. It's very profitable. It's okay. I don't care because he's paying. What? Customers always pay for me. But not this meal. - All the meals are the same. - I don't have money. - What? - I don't have money. - Why would you use my service, then? - Hey, that's not great. How can you pay? I told you I'd pay when we reach Saigon. How do we pay for this meal? It's okay. Run fast, or you will die! Stop, asshole! Hit him! Oh, my God! This bitch comes and causes trouble to my restaurant every day. Take care, honey. There're tons of mosquitoes in the forest. I hope you don't get malaria. Remember to wear warm clothes when you go to sleep. I'm not around to take care of you. Don't worry, I'll come back soon. When I have money, I'll build you a house. Que, where are you? Stop, just come home. Get in here, get in here. Hey, are you Hue? It's Que. Whatever. I dislike you already. - Your husband is Khai, right? - Yes. Your husband is Khai, right? Are you messing with me? - Stop hitting her. - Khai? Get off! How dare you! Show your face! Do you know the pillar is the most important part of the house? And the husband is like the pillar. Why did your husband destroy the pillar of another family? Let it go. - No! Take your phone out and record this! - For what? Gosh, don't you have a TV at home? Recording this to embarrass her for what they did with someone's husband. Record! Quick! How dare you! - Damn you! - Stop! What? Who the hell are you? Hello, officer. You want to assault her, right? No, officer. Everything happens for a reason. This girl's husband killed that girl's husband. Today that girl came here to find justice for her husband. Everyone must pay for what they've done. If you kill her, you commit murder too. Hey, he said commit murder. So how about my husband? If Khai is not arrested, where is justice for my husband's death? If Khai is a killer, he'll be punished by law. Don't worry. Just please go back home. - Okay. - Remember, - don't do anything foolish. - Okay. Go home. Luckily I hit her with my hand, not with a stick. I would have been in prison now. All the close relationships that the perpetrator can contact, we already investigated and tracked down. But we haven't been able to identify the one who rescued Khai. Duc, do you have any ideas? Now he might be forced to head to the city or go overseas. That's the only way to sell the diamonds. So, we have to quickly cover the entrance and exit of the main cities and borders. From what I saw on TV, Saigon is so tiny, but it's actually much bigger than the TV. Oh, God. The traffic jam is crazy here. - You can't find this in the countryside. - Why? There's no motorbike to cause the jam. We only have ox-carts. What now? Let's take photos, so I can show off when coming back. - Three pics, want more? - Out of the way. Can't you go somewhere else? - We just arrived here. - How can I go through? Let him take some to put on his own altar, bastard! We are from a small town, sorry. I'm sorry. We just sell and buy processed stones here. Please find another place. - Do you know any places like that? - I don't know. Somewhere specialized in manufacturing primeval gemstones, or bigger centers, maybe they'll buy it. Thank you! Oh, God, you are such an imposter. If this place can't afford to buy it, it must be worth so much. To be honest, I'm a bit anxious to take you here. Anxious about what? You didn't pay for the meal. You could easily run away without paying me. Now if you want to go to Hanoi, I'm willing to go. Hey, do you know anyone in Saigon? If I do, I would already develop a VIP motorbike taxi system here. I will not stay in that small town. Do you know anyone? No. But my wife has relatives here. Okay. Let's ask for their help before we will have to beg for gas money. Hello, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Do you remember Uncle Hai's address? I need his help. Uncle Hai? - Turn it off. - Okay. What a difficult song. The singer must be out of breath. Wonder if he's still alive. - Mister, please sing some more. - Yeah, please go on. Why are you here alone? Where's Que? I have some work here. Just dropping by to see and talk to your parents. Okay. Why are people wandering around my house? Why are you standing outside my house? - Hey, who are you coming into my house? - Stop! Stop! Or I'll call the police! Stop! Stop! Khai! Stop now! What? God! What's going on? Asshole, don't you see we are playing? Police here. - Run! - Run! Stop! Put your hands up! Come with us to the station. You caused too much noise. Stop! Khai! I'm sorry, officers. I just came here. I know nothing. - Stop making noises, okay? - Remember that. - Don't be sad. Where are we going? - Run, hurry! Wear the helmet! The police might take my bike away! Slow down. Why are we going so fast? - God! Shut up! You keep blabbering. - My bike is not a tank. Slow down, you are destroying my bike! Why didn't you go around the roundabout? Do you wanna die? Stop! Are these guys thugs? Why do they keep following us? - Yes, they are. - Show what you've got. BREAKING NEWS: PURSUITING CRIMINALS ON THE ROAD This afternoon, the police chased after a criminal, identified as Le Thanh Khai, the wanted killer. If anyone has any leads, please report to the nearest administration office, or call the hotline 0909000000. - Yeah! - Yeah! Stop it! You guys are overreacting. What now, Boss? Boss! So Khai has escaped? Idiot! If he didn't escape, how could we take that diamond, huh? That's what I expected. He has reached the city. Everyone, prepare to go tomorrow! - One, two, three. - One, two, three. Stop! Who told you to stop that? It was you. I told you to stop that silly game, not the drinking. - See my girlfriend? - Nope. This is all I've got. I'll give it to you to make your dream come true. Break it up. I just adore it. You adore it more than me? You and it look quite the same. You mean I'm like a pig? Don't say that, poor the pig. Let's break up! I'll break it. Here, take this money and do the eyelid surgery on one side. Wait until I have enough money for the other one. No, I want to do liposuction first. It's up to you. I love you. I love you more than anyone. God, if she lays on you, you must be out of breath. No, this pic was in the past. Here. When one's in love, all the flaws won't matter much. Cosmetic surgery forever! Oh, gosh. Why so different? There's no ugly woman. Only those who don't know about cosmetic surgery. I have checked carefully. This is a very valuable stone. Of course. Of all the stones I've ever seen, this is the most valuable one. Do you want to sell them all? Yes, keeping them will cause headaches. You know all the troubles. This is a big sum of cash. Do you have the means to carry it all? Yes, I have a bike waiting right outside. Is it okay if I sell one small piece first? Yeah, of course, it's up to you. Please sit down, and have some water. It'll take a minute. Thanks. It's difficult to find a place to sell it, why don't you just sell all of them? If I were you, I would sell them all and give my girlfriend a big chunk to get some big fruit for the new year. Here, this is your money. I've counted carefully, check again. No need. All right. Please put it in here to be safe. Selling gold makes so much money. - Thank you. - Never mind. That's yours. Three million? Fifty million. Not enough for you? - Slap my face, please. - For what? Slap it. Slap it hard. Ouch. - Why did you slap so hard? - You asked for it. No problem, one slap is 50 million. How about 100 million for one more slap? You're crazy. Give me your phone, mine is out of battery. No, don't use it to call random people. - Not like that, I just call my girlfriend. - But you can't. Why are you so selfish? You are fine paying 50 million for a ride, but not 5,000 for a phone call? How about 500,000 for a phone call? Here, be quick. Hello, it's me, Toan. How are you, Lieu? What do you need? Weird. I just call to ask if you're okay but you are so nonchalant. I have good news. Gather your parents, neighbors, relatives and all the acquaintances, I'm coming back to marry you right away. I have enough money. Toan, calm down and listen to me. I'm appreciate everything you have done for me. But we can't continue our relationship. Why would you say that? Did I upset you? I'm sorry, for a thousand times. It's not your fault. So rude, I'm on the phone. Who is rude now? No, not you. There's someone calling so I'm angry. - Hello? - Is it Khai? It's Ms. Loan. I'm not Khai, I'm Toan. Don't call again, you're so rude. Can't you be more polite? It's me. Go on. Let's break up. This is not fun. I'm working hard to give you money. But can you take care of me with your unstable motorbike-taxi job? You can't even take care of yourself. Lieu, I'll take care of you. I'll bring you a happy life. How? Nowadays, if you are poor, there's no life with just pure hearts. Please don't bother my girlfriend anymore. Hello, hello, hello? Something made you sad? She broke up with me. It's okay, you can find someone else. It's no use to be sad. Why are you crying? No, the chilis are hot. Thank you for helping me all this time. Maybe we'll meet again. - Wait. - What now? Our contract has finished. You're leaving me here? Now you have money to go by car. Please hire me. I used to drive a car before, even drive a cultivator. It's not that. I just need to act alone. Why is everyone leaving me? You made the right decision choosing our hospital. We have excellent doctors with the most modern technology. Now you can be assured that we can change your face and also your body. A lot of superstars came to us - so, no need to worry about anything. - Okay. He's such a smart guy to play it this way. Hey, so he will do a full body surgery? Is there a chance he wants to change his gender? You mean that he will cut "it"? Hey! Follow him. - Hey. - Hey, are you surprised to see us? Who are you? You thought you could trick us by having plastic surgery? - What? - What? Where's the gem? I don't know any gems. Are you kidding me? There's no gem here, help! That's a fake one. Fake? It's real. I get hit because of you. How dare you beat me? Stop! Who are you? Let me go! Help me! Let me go! Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. - Wanna play trick with me? - I didn't do anything. Why are you lurking around here? I won't spare your life next time. Get the hell out of here! Are you all right? You can rest now. Sir, someone came in and caused trouble. You have to watch out carefully. Don't let anything unfortunate happen. Roger that! Okay, okay. Thank you. Sure. - Hello. - Okay. Can I help you? Is there any rooms for long-term rent? Yes. How long will you stay? About three months. The price is 9 million a month. - Okay. - Can I have your ID card? Oh no, I forgot. If we don't have your ID card, we'll be fined a big amount. Hey, I'll stay with him, can I guarantee for him? It's okay then. Here's the key, welcome. Humans can't interfere with destiny. But how do you know I'm here? Why don't you go back home with the money and keep following me? - I can't come back even with the money. - Why? My ex-girlfriend has a new boyfriend. It's normal. It's not normal because my ex's house is opposite to my house. Every day I have to see my ex going out with her new love who is my ex. Now I'm their ex-lover. What are you saying? So sad. But you can't follow me all the time. I'll leave you when I can forget my ex-lover. When will you forget? I will when I have a new lover, but I don't know if my ex will dump her new lover and come back to me. God, my head is already spinning. Even I don't know what I'm talking about. Never mind. Just think that I can't come back home and I don't know anybody here, so I can only follow you. Just think that I work for you, okay? Please come in, boss. Hey, hush. Spread your arms. What are you doing? This is my job, let me do it. Gosh, I can do it. Don't worry, please sit down. Oh, wait. Use the pillow. Oh wait. This is too soft, this one is thicker. I haven't got used to the new job, so there might be some hiccups, please sympathize. - It's all fine. - What are you doing? Take off your shoes for healthy legs. Gosh, please behave normal like before. I can't. Before, you didn't have money, you have a lot now. How can I be normal? - What are you doing now? - Massaging for healthy body. Please leave me alone. Hey, hey. - Have you ever massaged for anyone? - Sometimes. No wonder it hurts so much. Okay, please get out. I need to have a private phone call. - Don't bother me. - Yes, sir. Remember not to bother us. Okay, thanks. No more bothering. - What now? - Sorry, I'm so annoying. How are you? I'm so miserable, I can't live anymore. I'm sorry that I get you involved. Does anyone at home causing trouble to you? There was a guy who tried to abuse me. Luckily, someone helped me out. How about you come back to your parents' house for a while? I'm too embarrassed to go back there. Now I'm not even dare go out of the house. All right. Try to get out of the house without anyone's notice. Then go to the city to meet me. But I don't know the way there. Don't worry, I'll show you the way. Hello, is this Khai? I'm Ms. Loan. Hello, miss. I have a house at the city's outskirt, but there's no one to look after it. You can just stay there. I'll arrange everything. Let me send you the address - okay? - Okay. Hold on, remember, don't let anyone know, this is between you and me. Okay. God, what are you doing? For safety, our money is in there. All right, please buy some baluts for me to get rid of all the bad luck. Eating baluts can dispel bad luck? - Go now. Buy a balut for me, hurry up. - I got it. Why so fast? There was someone eating this in the next room, so I asked for one. You can eat it. No, I'm being blessed. If I eat and get bad luck, you will fire me. Suddenly, my stomach hurts, I can't eat now. Stomachache? Is it bad? Because you don't eat the egg, so you get food poisoning, bad luck. Go and buy medicine for me, hurry up! - For food poisoning? - Yeah. - I'll go now. - Hurry up. Boss. What? I have the medicine. Why would you go now? No, it hurts so bad now. I need to be hospitalized. That bad? Come, I'll drive you to the hospital. No, no, just go back, I'll go by taxi. No, I work for you, let me drive you. If I don't drive you, what kind of employee am I? I will take you to the hospital. Hurry. Brother, did you get food poisoned? Let's go. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT Doctor, help, help. Doctor, help me, my boss is, he is... This is a hospital, not a market. Yeah, I know. Please attend the emergency. I repeat, this is a hospital. Whatever! It's an emergency. This is clearly a hospital, that's why we came. Where's the patient? Where's my boss? Come in there, Doc. The emergency's inside, why would you come out here? I'm sorry. Patient Nguyen Thanh Phong, please. Sorry. Patient Le Van Hoai, please. Hey you, stop. What's that? Why is he running so fast in the hospital? - Watch your way! - Seriously. Boss! - What? - The guy who chased us. Run! Be careful, there are a lot of stretchers in here. Hurry up! I'm so sad. I'm his best friend, living in the US. I came back to visit him immediately after I heard the news. Why did you die so suddenly? Are you crazy? My son just woke up after two months being unconscious. Why did you say such thing to him? What kind of friends are you? Who are you? - It's all right. - Sorry. Sorry. I'm so happy for you. Gosh, what kind of friends are you! Happy for the family. People do make mistakes, you know? Oops. Where are you? Go to the hospital to help me. Come with me to finish the procedure, please. All right. Honey! Remember not to move or breathe, or they'll know. You are so good at playing a dead body. I might as well introduce you to some film crew. What? Buddha! Buddha! So cold. That's why everyone is covered with blankets. No one's talking either. Maybe they are going under for surgeries. The one needed doesn't come, but comes the unneeded one. Check every room. God! Is my life ending here? I'm still a virgin. Check the morgue also. - Where do you go? I'll drive you. - Where are you going? - No, thanks. - I'll offer cheap price. No thanks. - No, thanks. - I'll offer cheap price. - Where are you going? - I'm not going. Where are you going? I'll drive. No, thanks. God, I hate silence. Hey you! Don't mess with me. If there's a sound in here, I'll die immediately. I'm so cold. Help me! They only bring you in here when there's no way to save you. Please let me know your name and address, I will offer you some food after getting out of here. My name's Toan. I'm a motorbike-taxi driver. God! It's fate. I'm also scared. Don't mess with me. Mess with you my ass. Are you dead or alive? I'm still alive. If you don't help me, I'll die. Have you seen a dead one that wants to joke around? I'm alive. Please help me! If I can, I'll be helping you out. Damn, there's a new one. Sir, could you please turn off the air conditioner? Doctor! Doctor! Help me. Are you still alive? - God! - Huh? Why are you two saying the same thing? Have you seen a dead one talking? Help me, Doctor. Help me, boss. I'll take him to emergency room, I'll be back soon. It's so cold, boss. Now I feel bad for the penguins. If you go to emergency room, they'll know. Give me some heat, the snow is falling. - What? - Snow falls. Give me some heat. Oh my God! That won't work. Our skin need to touch. - Will that work? - Yes, our skin must touch. Boss, I want to pee. What now? Because it's cold. Hey, wanna go? No, thanks. All right. There you go. Boss. What? Help me! - Help with what? - Hurry up, it's coming. - Please open the window for me. - What window? My window. What? - I have to do that? - You must help until the end. Hurry up. it's almost there. All right. - Done! Do whatever you want. - Good job. Is it done? - Boss. - What? Let's do it again, please. Again? - Done. - We don't have time. My legs, it's stuck. Okay? I told you, it's stuck. - What now? - Pull it up. I'd rather die. Why is it still stuck? Next time, I will do it all by myself. Sir, it's all clear. I'm sure they're still here. Search thoroughly! - Did we cut them off? - What? - Did we cut them off? - Yes, we did. - So why don't you put me down? - Wait a second. What if I will be hospitalized for real after this? What? Thief! Thief! Checkmate. Respond. Wanna run? You thief! No, not me. Stop. - Is it yours? - Yes, thank you. Be careful. People come from small towns are often robbed. Let me drive you. All right, wait a second. Hello, honey? I've been calling you. I'm in Saigon now. Where should I go next? To avoid the police, find a crowded place to cut them off. I'll tell you the address later. Remember? Report! Target is going to the market. Boss, why do they follow us all the time? Why don't we call the police? Call the police? It's all your fault. What? I didn't do anything. If you didn't go with me, how could they have known and followed? I wonder if I owed you anything in the previous life? - Why do you keep following me? - What's that? It's the opposite. I have had bad luck ever since I followed you. Being chased then hospitalized, almost ended up in the morgue. Being chased like a criminal. Let's go our own way from now on. I told you already but you didn't listen. As long as you stay in crowded places, you will be easily busted. It will get ugly once someone knows where you are, understand? Yes, I know, thanks. You, it's you! THE CRIMINAL IS HIDING IN CO MAY COFFEE SHOP. COME NOW. PLEASE TRY TO STALL, I'LL COME RIGHT AWAY. How are you? I'm scared. Someone's following me. Luckily, I cut them off. What should I do now? I'll text you the address immediately. Hey, sit down. - What? - Sit down. No, I have a plan, I have to go now. No, sit down, they haven't come. Who's coming? Taxi hasn't come. - I'll take one out there. - No, sit here. It's too sunny, sit here. - Hello. - Yes, is that you, Tam? I and my brother left the coffee shop. - Yeah. - Where are you? I'm here. I don't know where this place is. Whenever he goes, I'll tell you. He's right... Hey, hang up, he left. Boss, wait for me. I can't run anymore. I have valvular regurgitation, boss. Why are you going so fast? I'm not Ronaldo, boss. Hey, your friend is following, should we stop? - Keep going. - Boss! Boss, please slow down. The two-way street is near. - Are we there yet? It's taking too long. - Not yet, it's far away, don't rush me. Can't you live without me? It's not that. I just realized they're still following us. Please drive to the Nam O villa. I'm exhausted. Can't bear it anymore. Ms. Loan. It's me, Khai. God, you have changed so much. - Don't you recognize me? - No. I'm Toan. I talked to you on the phone. Your memory is good, isn't it? Miss, I'm so sorry. Forget about it. Come in. If I had such a big house, my girlfriend wouldn't leave me. Come in. Le Thanh Khai, put your hands up, you are under arrest for homicide. What are you doing? Did you get the wrong guy? We'll know when we come to the headquarter. But this man... You two, follow me to give testimony too. Come on. God. What was that? We're one step behind. No, it will take more than 10 steps. We're more than 10 steps behind. Idiot! You deserved that! We can't let the police arrest Khai. Or else, our efforts will be in vain. So we will go against the police, boss? If we involve in this, we will be tied to the pole, got electric shock and some extra sleeping pills. Asshole! My head hurts. What is this? Oh my God. - Are you okay? Honey, please wake up. - It hurts. Ma'am, are you okay? Attack him! Khai, run now or never. - Yes, no second chance. - Yes. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up, run. - Let me go. - Let's go, Khai! Go! - Khai! - Beat him. What are you doing? What are you doing? - I saw it around here. - What exactly? Beat him, go to hell. Shit. Beat him! - Why did you beat me? - Wrong one. What are you doing? What? Beat him! Hit him in the head! Oh my God. - Beat him! Hit the head! - What are you doing? Return to the police later. Run! Run! Oh my goodness. Officer, what do we do now? Give me the gun. - Thank you. - I'm the one to say thanks. I'm sweating. Are you okay? Why didn't you even turn back? Hey, are you all right? Are they the ones who beat you up? Please get in the car. What? We're still arrested? I thought turning back will help our case. Khai is guilty, he has to take responsibility. I'm innocent. They pulled a trick on me. Right, Khai wouldn't commit such crime. Hey, what are you doing? Why is it so noisy? Don't you let anyone sleep? What's happening? Oh my God, fire! Why did you kill Thang? I didn't do it. Proof is right there, how could you deny? You guys pulled a trick on me? Assholes! Everyone! Catch him. If you cooperate with us soon, things wouldn't happen this way. I was so confused. All the evidences were against me. Earlier, they set it up so that I wouldn't get arrested. They're afraid the diamonds you find on me will incriminate them. From what you said, they are the murderer and they blamed it on you, right? Exactly. If I were guilty, I wouldn't come back when I had chance to escape. That's right. Why did you come back? It was none of your business that they were beaten. This case is pretty complicated. Please give me a chance to prove my innocence. I can feel that you're innocent. But I have no power to release you, please understand. Hurry up. Hurry up. You drive like shit! Beat him. Don't do that! Please don't beat him. She's Khai's wife. - Catch her! - Follow her. Hurry up! - Follow her. - Catch her. Got you! - Got you! - Let go! Please, let me take that call, maybe it's my wife. - Where are you? - If you say anything about us, your wife will die first, remember that. God, they have my wife. She might die in their hands. If I knew this, I would have shot them earlier. Please give me a chance. I'm sure that your husband won't give you up. We'll keep our promise. I just want to have what I'm looking for. You two can live well with the rest. Honey. Khai. I have what you need, let my wife go. - Who do you go with? - I'm alone. Okay, give me that. That's what we need. If you gave it to me sooner, there wouldn't have been much trouble. - Let him pass. - Wait! Plastic surgery worked, you look handsome now. Thank you, it's so tiring chasing you around. Are you kidding me? What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, what we need is here. - Let's go! - All the best, then. So cute! Honey, honey, are you okay? So I told you everything that could happen. Doesn't sound too bad. But I won't be able to prove my innocence. I'm afraid if you have some mishaps, I don't know for sure what will happen. If they know you are with someone else, they might kill your wife. Hello? It's time to play, maybe at some waterfall. Okay, you did a good job. Sure. The bike might be gone this time. I gotta say you're so beautiful. Is your husband infertile or something? What's that? A knife. Help me. Help me. Damn, he's finished. I'm not stupid. - Where's my wife? - Khai, help me, Khai. Khai! Help me! - Honey! - Khai. Let my wife go or I'll throw it away. Khai, calm down. Listen to me, calm down. You know how much the diamonds are worth. We can work on a deal, alright? You'll have nothing left if you do that. Don't scare me, don't scare me. I'm scared your wife will die first, kill her. Wait! Sister. Turns out it's you. - Hello, are you here? - I'm on my way. Come to watch a movie. Loan turned out to be the main character. A villain, to be exact. Okay. Khai. It's real. Are you surprised? So you set up everything? Where is this? The west of a chasm in the forbidden forest. This is the west of chasm, in the forbidden forest. Phuoc, come and pick her up. Okay. You really believe someone will give away anything for free? Why are you so slow? You thought we spent all the money in the mine for you to exploit for free? If we don't cover for you, how could you mine in peace? You should have behaved well so all of us can make profit. It's you who forced me to do this. I just take back what belongs to me. You are so evil. You have to thank me for sparing your live until now. If there's no police, you would never know my true identity. Anyway, I gave your family a chance to reunite. Khai. - You guys remember to clean up carefully. - Yes, ma'am. - Cut the rope. - Okay. We should not meet each other. This way. Hey. Hurry up. We met again. What? Loan, stop, I will shoot if you keep running. Take her to the car and wait for my order. Yes, sir. Just a little bit more. So close. Please help me! Why am I so stupid? My mom will be so mad. What are you doing? It's odd. We're about to die, odd my ass. - Stubborn idiot! - Let go of me. I'm all safe up here. - Everyone stands still! - Scumbag! I'm shot. Help me! Khai! I'll kill you. Hot-headed idiot! Khai, are you all right? Khai, are you okay? Khai, are you okay? God! Why ask that when he's in agony? Take him to the hospital. Dad, something happened to mom. - Dad, come back. - Come back here. - Dad, come back. - Hurry, hurry up. - What's happening? - I'm hurt! My belly hurts. I told you not to eat all that junk food. I'm about to deliver the baby. I'll take you to the hospital. God, are we there yet? We're close. It hurts so bad. - I think I'll deliver the baby out here. - Slow down, no need to hurry. Stop the vehicle. We will eventually reach the hospital, only around 40 km away from here. God! You never call me in your ups, only when in your downs. This is a tractor, not an aircraft. If we go fast, the film will end and everyone will leave. Look, some people are still watching. Remember to introduce this film to your friends, okay? Why are you laughing? I'm serious.
