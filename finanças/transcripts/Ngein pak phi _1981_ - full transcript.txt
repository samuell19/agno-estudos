"Leang's Birds hill" A.D.1594 GHOST MONEY "Leang's Birds hill Viillage" A.D.1594 - Your dad isn't home yet, Chalau? - Not yet. Better let my wife dies then let my drink spills. I better go to hell than seeing my wife. My wife is making me sick. I'd sell my wife for my drink. Who wants her? Soak with alcohol again, huh. Are you going to drink until your face wrinkled? All money gone to bottles. Don't you care of the family. I had given you some a few days ago, 30 bahts. And, it was just that. When will I get more again? I'm not an officer to have a salary. Why do I have to have an undertaker like you as my husband? You drink, you hook a whore, do all sins that no one can't imagine. - What are you talking about? - Don't you think you can hide it from me. - Muan told me everything. - How could he know when he didn't go with me. I just go there to check your son, Mol. Did you peek on my son? At least, he works for everyone in this house, unlike you. - I don't want to talk anymore. - Wait, Malee. - Calm down. - I won't calm. Go back to your bottle. - Don't be mad... I puke. - So stink like shit. Dad... Aunt Malee, check this pot I don't care. - Dad, check it. - What again? I think it's a money saver. See, there's a hole here. - Who did you steal it from? - I didn't. I was playing with Beau and Pui behind the temple... My stone dropped near a stupa so I dig for it, and I found this. That's fine then. Honey... Is it beautiful? Imagine if this is full of money. How can you find money? You don't even have things to eat. Hello, officer. Where are you going? My friend has just come from Bangkok so I teken him out to show our village. This is teacher Lawan that I talked about. He's Pipop. We're friends since elementary school. - Nice to meet you. - Me too. Pachern praises you a lot that you take a good care of your students. It's my duty to do that. - You come to work here? - No, just for my vacation. I wanted to come here for a long time, but didn't have a chance. Where have you been? I'm just back from my student's home, he's getting ill. He hasn't attended school for many days. You work so hard even it's weekend I have to go before it's dark. - I'll see you at the school then. - You're welcomed. - You too. - Yes. Maybe I'll help you teach students. Thanks. Bye. Like her? I wonder how a little lady like teacher is so brave to stay here alone and do her teaching. Do you think aunt Malee will be back? Sure. Dad must be with her to ask her back now. I miss our mom every time I see dad fights with aunt. Don't talk about her. She is in heaven now. - Mom's here? - Mol is back. Dad isn't here too. Let's go inside. I don't want to see him. Wait. Why don't you come out to welcome me back? - Where is mom? - She's out. Had a fight again, huh. Where are you going, my dear? Your dear is a hooker, not me. I'm just teasing. - Don't be perverse on me. - Wait, Chalau. Let me go! I'm hungry. Cook something for me. Find it yourself. We're going to sleep. It's not midnight yet. I feel alseep, don't you hear me? I can't ask you to do anything, huh. I work hard and get tired. Could you please me with something? I'm not your slave. - Please, brother Mol. - Get away! - My sister really feels asleep. - Fine. I don't want to eat then. Let me go. Are you insane? Don't butt in. - Let her hand now. - No! - I said let go. - Why to? I want to fuck you. Let go. - Bastard! - Come, sister. How long are you going to torture me? - Where are we going? - Pui's house. Wait until our dad's back. Hurry. Mom. Dad. Dad's there. Dad... Dad... Dad... - Dad, Mol is getting mad again. - He did obscene on me too. Nonsense. That's impossible. It's true. He even dared to do it in my room. - It's true. - Damn Mol! Mol, what are you doing? - What mom? - Lau told me that you did obscene on her. What? I don't know anything. Do you think my daughter is a whore? You're my dad. Who else could I think to her if she's not my sister. They both don't like me and my mom. You know, they two have discussed a plan to make you two seperated. - You lie. - Don't say a word. You thought that I wasn't back, right? I was back quietly, or else I couldn't have known. That's why you condemn him, huh. See how are you kids like? Who lies then? - I swear. If I lie, I'd let the ghost breaks my neck. - I hope you will get that wish. Fine. If you don't like me, I go. Wait, Malee. Don't mind of my kids. If you don't give me an authority over this house, I'll leave. Your kids must obey me so everything will be settled. Can you get away from this? - Alright, if you want it then. - Really? Yes. You hear your dad said now. Remember that. Or else... What are you looking at? - What will you do then? - I don't know. Aunt won't give me money for a week. She blames me that I only just paly, don't do any housekeeping. But, you earn some when you help dad. Not anymore. He has to share a half to my aunt. The rest, he loses it to a bottle. I know how to find money. - Steal it? - No. - Do you want to have money to by sweet? - Yes. How? I can't tell you right now. Tonight, after 8PM, see me at the back of abbot's place, I'll tell you. - He will steal abobot's money. - No. You'll know then. Well? I gaurantee I won't bring any trouble on this. - OK, I go. - If you go, I go. Come on. - Let's go. - Wait. Wait for me. Hurry. - Let's go. - Wait. You haven't told me what we'll do. - We'll go get money in that store. - What money? Ghost money. I quit then. I'm afraid of ghost. Are you chicken? Dead men can't do any harm. - Are you really going to do that? - Why not? It's better than leaving it in those mouths. - That's a sin. - What sin? You just scare. No, I'm not like Pui. Are you sure it's there? All corpses have it. It's a custom. If some deads come from rich families, they put more. Trust me, I help dad on this. Why don't you come here at noon? What if the abbot could catch us? Come on. Waste our time. Alright. There's no turning back now. We have three of us. Why afraid? But I... Come on. Come. Just shut up and move already. Wait for me. Wait. Don't leave me behind. You're such a chicken. Damn dogs! Why do they have to howl this time? Get in. Get in! Wah! Big guy, small heart. Why don't you open it? We can run, just in case. If you're so afraid, you can go home now. How can I go home alone? I won't. Then, shut up. That one first. - Come, Pui. Help me. - No. You help. I hold the candle. Then, watch this satchel too. Come on Beaw. What a smell. - So stink. - Don't talk like that in here. - If you say it's stink, it will be twice more stink. - OK. Smell like a fragrance. Come on Beaw. They're rotted. Get the money. - Why me? - You started this idea. Let's do this. Pui, hold the candle here. Damn it! Did you really need to scream? - Someone could hear that. - I'm sorry. Something has just run pass my feet. I found it. Just 2 bahts? So little. There're still more coffins. - Are you going to open them all? - Yes. We're here now. Just do it. We close this coffin first, and you must help me on the other coffins. Fine. Then, I'll do it alone. And, I'll share you just a baht. If you want to share as it should, you must help me. Well? It's wasting more time now. You can wash your hands later if they get dirty. - OK. - You? I won't. Just give me 2 bahts then. - I help you hold the candle, and that's it. - Fine. Beau, help me close this coffin. Wow! We earn a lot. Come on, the candle is almost out. Hey! Can I have a share for more if I pick this one? OK, I'll give you 5 bahts. You're so lucky. This corspe is a new one. I'm a lucky man. Hold this. Let me. Why is it so stiff? I got it. Help! Its eyes! My hand! I'm bitten. My hand! I'm bitten. Damn you! I'm afraid now. I won't do it again. Run! If it can open its eyes, it can get up. Chicken! You open its mouth wide so its eyes were opened. - Really? - Why did I have to lie you for? Hurry! It's alomost sunrise now. I won't do it again. I want just 2 bahts as the same. Come on, you. You do it. - See, a pile of money. - Fine. I don't feel waste now. Help me close this coffin. Watch it for me. - How is Bangkok right now? - So crowd. I love a peace place like here. I'm here for a long time. I haven't seen many people. I'm glad to see you here. - Have a fun trip. - Yes, sir. See you. Hello, Lau. Where did you get a lot of money to buy those? I bought this for you. No, thanks. Just keep it for yourself. Where did you get a lot of money? - Not your money, of course. - Watch your mouth! What happen, Malee? Look at your kid. How can you get these stuff? - Buy them. - Are you tempting me? Go on, get him. That's not enough. - Please, don't punish him. - He tempts me. Damn kid! You like to look for trouble all the time. Alright. If you want to know, I'll tell you. Well, the thing is, me and Beau and Pui have been at the market to do a job for payment. We earn a lot and we buy these sweets. You did a job. I won't believe even you swear to god. He says the truth. He used to complain that if aunt didn't give him money, he'd find it himself. But, I won't believe him. Fine, I didn't hire you to believe me. You both have black hearts. You talk too much. You hear what your son said, right? Clam down, Malee.. You have sucha loud mouth. You want some. No, thanks. Why are you looking me like that? Don't you believe me? I can swear. Mom, Lorr is facing right to you. Are you going to swear or curse me? You don't have to swear. I believe you. I'm glad that you have my blood. When it's necessary, you have to help yourself. You're my son. My Malee... my Malee. When I have leisure time, I like to come here. It's quiet and peace. - Tired? - No. Villagers call this hill "Leang's birds hill" There's an old cave back there. - Actually, no one wants to come here much. - Why? It might because it's too quiet. Also, there're a few people died up here without a cause. Yeah, it's very quiet. There's a story that one Khmer had run away from a civil war in his country to hide here. He fed many birds, and he liked them. If someone tried to steal his things, he would cursed him to dead. After the war was over, his relative came to ask him back, but he wanted to stay here. He loved this place and he wanted to die here. There, his grave. Would you like to see the cave? Yes. - Watch it! It's dark in there. - Yes. Is there still any bird in here? I don't think so. After the Khmer man died, all birds have gone. But, sometimes, villagers hear a big group of birds flying pass by. But, when they look for birds, there's nothing. Inpossible. Yes, I also couldn't believe it when I was first here. But, when I'm here for a while, I admit that there is some strange power over this place. - Wait. - What is it? I think I hear bird's noise. There're a lot of them too. Sound comes from that way. Let's see. Here... What is this? There's no bird here. We should go back. A big storm out there. But, the weather was still fine when we reached here. Cold. We'll get wet if we go out there. The sound is gone. I don't care about getting wet. But, let's not stay here. Yes. There's no storm out here. Let's go. Come on. Come on. No, thanks. I've finished from the teacher's house. - How far did you go today? - Leang's birds hill. - Have you ever been there? - Yes. It's strange there. I've heard there were some people died there. Do you know about that? Yes, but I wasn't here when it happened. Villagers said they were bitten by birds to death. Birds? It could be possible. It couldn't be. No birds in that cave for a decade. Even there're some, I won't believe it. Birds can't kill people. That cave must have some mysterious things we don't know. Do you believe the villagers' tale? I can't believe. You have used all the money? I'm starved for a long time. So, I want to eat everything. You too used all money. What about you, Pui? Do you still have some left? How can I have left? I was share the least. No more dead people to pick more money now too. Hey! Hey! Hey! Look at that. Teacher. Sorry to bother you. - It's alright. - Are you alright? I just got a little sweat. Yesterday, I took my friend to Leang's birds hill. Must be the weather. Ah, I know where to find more money. - Where? - Pet birds hill. Yes. I almost forgot. They said there's a lot of money. We could be rich this time. - Right, Pui? - I won't join you this time. Everybody knows ghosts there are so fierce. Chicken. We'll go there at daylight. It doesn't matter. Day or night, that place is so frightening anyway. Fine, we can go just both of us. Someone is here. Hide. It's him. - What are you doing here? - I want to get rich too. - Come on, before it's dark. - Go. Don't think too much. It's just a nightmare. But, he seems to be so mad. He pointed at me that I would bring him trouble. How can we bring him trouble when we won't think to go back again. Believe me and relax. It's getting dark. Hurry! Quick. Just a little more. Got it. H..H..How can it be like this? Doesn't look like a dead man. Look at his eyes. What if they blink. Stop talking nonsense. Hurry! Down there. A lot of coins. Give me a hand. We're rich now. They're old stuff too. We'll earn a lot if we sell them. I must get a share this time. I dig too. I know this time is special. Sweet! There are so many. This is so great. There are more over here. That's all. - Are you sure? - Help me close this coffin. Wait, there's still one more, there. Just leave it in the mouth. I think so. Look at his eyes. Then, this one is mine. Up to you. We two better count those coins. What a hard mouth. I got it. Hurry! It's raining. You're stupid. See, it's gold. Beau, you. Damn it! You scare me. Why did you do that? He wouldn't feel it. Come here... Let's close the coffin. Where have you been, Beau? - You get dirty all over. - Don't bother, mom. Don't you listen to me anymore? - I'll starve you then. - I'll never get starved. Don't you dare. Do you want to try? How can't you have some good from me? You're a bastard like your dad. Are you going to die telling me the truth? I told you I didn't go nasty anywhere. Listen to that lie. He was soaked all over but he doesn't admit it. Liten how good he lies. Do you hear me? - Yes. - What did I say? You said he's good. What good? - Good liar. - Yes, good liar. Like..his dad. Knock it off. What are you writing? N..N..No. See, he lies even I catch him on sight. Loud mouth.. Loud mouth is a whore mouth. You die! You'll be starved today. He would be hungry then. Shut up, you old fart. I didn't write it. Stop lying. - What happen to him? - He's proud for himself he can earn money. He and his friends went do a job at the market. That's good. Better than playing all day. Beaw... Beaw... Wake up. I order you to wake up. Beaw... Wake up. And, come out to me. Now! Beaw... - Who is that? - It's me. I'm out here. What bastard comes to call me this very night? Not even a dog here. G..G..Ghost!.....H..H..Help! - Ghost! Don't! - No one can help you, lazy prick. No one can help you, thievish prick. I scared! Mom! Ghost! Mom! What's wrong with you? - Ghost, mom. - Are you out of your mind? You scream all around. - What ghost do you talk about? - I'm afraid. Don't leave me, mom. Let me sleep with you tonight. - Please. - What's wrong with you? Don't ask now. I'll tell you tomorrow. But, let me sleep with you tonight. OK. What's god on this? You can't run away from me. Lorr! Something happened. Come quick. - What happen? - Just come with me. Where are you going? I won't allow you out. Just come with me now. Don't you remember last night? Do you want to get starved again? Chalau, go get your brother back. I've never seen sucha nasty boy like this. Mol, where are you going? - Bangkok. - Why? Sell these coins. Where did you get these? They belongs to Lorr. I stole from him. - These must be worth a lot. - Where did he get these? They like to play at the back of temple. I think they must find treasure right there. You hide this pot safely. I have to go, or I wouldn't catch the bus. If dad asks about me, lie for me. Don't worry. I'm good on lying. Be back soon. We'll be millionaires this time. What? Just hid it before someone knows this. I'll be out for a few days. Will you miss me? Go to hell anywhere you want. Dad, dad... - Where is dad? - There, still sleeping. - Where is Lorr? - He's at aunt Foong's house. Wake him up, please. Someone died at Foong's house. Now who? This early? Beaw. Why do you die so early? Try to be strong, ok? I will tell the police. What's wrong? My god! Foong. Help her. I think he was killed by that Khmer ghost. What makes you think like that? Didn't you hear aunt Foong say? Last night, Beaw saw ghost. I think that Khmer ghost wants his belonging back. And, those ghosts in that store don't want their belonging back? We burned all to our sweets. Nothing happens. Store's ghosts must be not fierce as that Khmer ghost. We might die like Beaw. - I think we should return him. - Are you nuts? What if we get caught. I won't go back there again. If he really wants it back, he killed us now. I think Beaw died because he was tired until his heart stopped beating. Or, he got faint to death. But, I will return my part. Think about it carefully. We were so tired to dig it up. I make a decision. You don't want to return it, that's fine. But, could you help me dig the coffin up again? No way. I don't want to go there again. You're on your own. Stupid! Go back home, Lorr. You run around all day. Go back to the house. This bastard too. Can't you stop drinking? Who's drunk? Come on, Malee. - Kick me? - No. My sweater dragged me. Where is it? Sister... Sister... Sister... My saving pot is gone. There's a lot of money in there. Have you seen it? - Where did you keep it? - Out there, behind the wood stack. - What will I do now?...Mol... - He's not here. It must be those mom and her son. Wait. Where are you going? To see aunt Malee. Don't, or you will be punished. Even she really took it, she wouldn't accept it. If you don't get hit, you'll be starved for a day. Wah! How can I get the pot back? I must be killed. Wait, come back here. Come back... Look at him. I... I... I come to apologize. I was wrong, please forgive me. Don't do anything to me. I'm scared. I'm scared. Don't you know where did he take these coins? No. Pui, do you know where Beau took these coins from? I don’t know too. They're old stuff, should keep them. No. I think I will sell for my son's funeral. The rest I will make a merit for him. I'd better help you pay for the funeral. But, you should keep these coins. Please, accept it. I help you more. - Please, no. - Accept it. I really want to help. Please, keep these coins for yourself. You may do whatever you want with it. That money doesn't have thing to do with those coins at all. I really want you to keep these coins for yourself. Yes. If you're not really in trouble, I suggest not to sell them. Lorr, wait. - What? - Teacher is here. Yeah... - You return all coins? - No. I knew it. You still want to keep them, huh. No. They were stolen. All of them? Too bad. - All I can do was asking for his forgiveness. - Yeah? You went with who? - Alone. - Anything happened? - What thing? - That ghost as what you told me. See, you're just scared for nothing. Me and Phop tried hard to tell her not to sell those coins, but she didn't listen. She insisted us to keep them. It's our nature, though. Sell them then, and give all money that we sell to her. Pity her. She's all alone now. - Finish it? - Yes. - Then, please. - Thank you. - What about your job? - I've telegramed to extend for more vacation. What if it wouldn't be approved? I don't care. If I was fired, I'll be a janitor at your school. - Lorr... - Ghost! You see me as a ghost now, huh? You powder your face that white. How can I remember you. And, what the hell you're going into someone's room like that? Mol isn't here? None of your business. Lorr... Lorr... Go to sleep. It's getting late now. You always find yourself trouble. If there's something lost, she will blame us anyway. I want to see in there. The pot might be there. Is it so important to you? How much do you save in that pot? A lot... You must pay for bringing me trouble. Don't. Don't come any closer. Don't. Don't. Don't. - Here, uncle. - Thanks. Thank you for your service today. You should go home. Your parents will be worried. OK. Don't o wandering off. Yes. Let me know if you need anything. Thanks. You scare me. I thoguht I was haunted. What are you doing here? Thief! Why does your voice change like that? You're bastard. You dare to steal even a ghost money I don't understand what you said. Do you still pretend to be innocent? I've done wrong. I'll return them all, but don't tell anyone. I don't want to be in jail. You can hit me if you want. It's too late now. Follow me now. I won't go. You must. I'm scared. Don't hurt me. You must come with me. You must come with me. Come with me now. Pui doesn't wake up yet? He wasn't with you last night? No. What's wrong with this? I thought he was at Foong's house. But, Choy said he wasn't there. Did you do any job at the temple last night? No, I was sick. This isn't good. Or, it's Pui's turn. - What did you say? - Nothing. I just thought... Pui! My son! What happened to you? How can it be like this? I warned you. What the hell is this? Get him to the doctor. Yes, quick. Let's get him to the doctor. Where have you been last night? No. Then, how this pyjamas get stained? I have no idea. You didn't close door and windows. I don't understand too. You're not much of a sleeper. But, You slept like dead last night. We'll talk about it later. I'm late now. Teacher is here to visit Pui. - Hello. - Hello. This is my friend. Hello. Please, come inside. Is he getting better now? No. His wound isn't healed, and he gets high fever. He doesn't get any better even he takes medicine. Come in. Pui, teacher Lawan is here. Don't. Help! I'm scared. Don't let her come near me. I'm scared. Pui, don't you remember your teacher? I'm scared. Don't hurt me. Mom, help me. - My son... - I'm scared. Help! - My son... - I'm hurt.

He might raved because of fever. It's alright. It can be possible that he was bitten by some insects. It can't be. No insect can bite to the bone like that. - I'll keep in touch. - OK. - We're leaving. - Bye. Want to have a rest. Would you excuse me. Wait. Have a good day. What's wrong? I don't know. She seems not to be in mood today. She seems changing a lot these days. You might think too much. She might get stress from her work. I think I'll quit my job, and come to help teacher full-time. That could be better. Please, don't bother. It's okay, aunt. Sister, wake up. Wake up! - What is this? - Listen. Someone is digging under the floor. There's a crack sound too. Where? I hear nothing. Are you nuts? I really heard it. Sleep now. Wake up! I hear it again. Someone must do something down there. I will tell dad. Dad, hurry. Wake up, dad. Damn it! What is it? Don't pull it.

Tiger? Yuke! You're just a kitty cat. Who's going to steal our stuff? There's nothing to steal in our house. - He must eat too much. - I really heard it.

My eye! It hurts. What should we do? Health center is close now. We have to wake the doctor up, no matter what happen. - My eye! - Malee. Pui. Our son is there. Pui, my son. - Where did you find him? - At Leang's birds hill. I walked to cut asparagus there. I saw him lied unconscious. I was looking for you all night. Your hands aren't healed. Why did you go out again? I'm hurt. Where have you been? Tell me. I'm hurt, dad. - Let's change a new bandage. - OK. - I need your help, Man. - Come, help together. Lorr, wait. Where have you been all night? We worried of you. Tell me. I can't. Why? Please, don't ask me. Wait. Don't you trust me or love me anymore? It's because I trust and love you and dad so I can't tell you anything. Damn it! What a nasty boy you are. Aunt Malee would want to punish me so bad now. I think she can't do anything to you right now. But from now on, you can't get out anywhere on night time again. Why? Guys, let's check him out. - Do you know him? - No, I don't. Students, go back to your class. Do you hear me? - Let's go, or we'll be punished. - She's so mean. - Let's go back to our class. - Or, we might be punished. What happen to them? Don't they care of study anymore? Wait, lady. I'm not sure at first. But now, I'm really sure. - It must be like I thought. - I don't understand what you said. You are possessed by a fierce ghost. What are you talking about? Wait, lady. Trust me, this is dangerous. We must get rid off him before it's too late. - Sooooo scaaaary. - I'm not kidding you. I really see it. Alright, ghost then. Can you come see me? I want to help, but we need to do a ritual at the place he was buried. Where? Leang's birds hill. The soul comes from that place. You must come see me. That Khmer guy? He gets high fever Let's bring him to the health center. I also think like that. Don't, please. Don't torture me anymore. He'll come and force me to go back again. I'm hurt. I can't hold it. Pui... Tell me. What did you do? Who forced you? Dad... Tell dad, Pui. Tell me. Come on. Tell dad. Beaw, you come to pick me now? Wait for me. We did bad things together. We want to be rich. We want money. What happen, son? Tell me. Don't, don't. I'm scared. Don't come in. - Tell me. - What happen, son? What's wrong, son? Pui... Pui... No, my son. No! Pui... Pui... You might not remember me. We haven't seen each other for a long time. Is it you, shaman Ngeg? Yes sir. How come do you come back here again? Let's go inside. I have an important thing I want you to know. Because I'm not sure I will make it. Better talk inside then. Will you tell me? Will you tell me? Tell me or not, bad boy. Tell me! Just tell dad. Why do you have to tolerate this pain? I can't tell you even you punish me to death. Stubborn kid! I've never founf this in my life. Waste time to punish him. Let's go to my room. I'll put you tincture. Damn ghost! Don't you get enough scaring me? You make me blind too. What if I blind both of my eyes? It's better that you was blinded just one. You curse me. You want me to be blinded all, right? So you can find a new wife? Uncle Luan... - What now? - There's one more dead to be in the coffin. - Now who? - Pui. Pui... How can it be? When did he die? This morning. Let's go. OK. Don't cry, Lorr. - Lau, watch him closely. - Yes. I'll go with you. Don't you go anywhere. What the hell is this? Beaw slept to death. Aunt Melee was attacked by ghost birds. Now, it's Pui. There's no use. I'll die like them. - I'll tell you everything. - What will you tell me? Lawan... Are you in there? Lawan... - Are you alright? - Phop... You shouldn't come here alone. Can you get up? Yes. I wouldn't have known if no one told me. What happened here? I only remembered that I walked to here and I heard the storm sound out of the cave. I turned around and the storm hit me until I couldn't breath. And, I felt nothing then. - What? - The shaman told me to come here. What shaman? Just find him, and you will know everything. Shaman, shaman... Have you seen any chinese guy before you came in here? No. Shaman, shaman... How can you know this shaman? Why did he appoint you here? I met him at the school. He said I'm in danger. - I was... - What is it? I was possessed by that Khmer's soul. So, he appointed me to do a ritual to get rid off him. And, you believe him? I think we must find the murder first. I think we must find the murder first. No one can catch me. Lawan, you... Lawan, don't do this. I can't breath. - I'm not your Lawan. - Don't. - You... - You... What happened to me? Don't you know that you almost choke me to death? I think it's this wand that save me. I've just stood there, but why... I've never thought this could be possible. But now, I believe there must be something wrong around here. - What are you talking about? - Let's get out of here, and I'll tell you. You're insane. Didn't you feel disgusting at all. It almost frights me to death just to listen to it. There's no help. No one can help. Let's go home. But, our dad is an undertaker. He migh know how to deal with. I don't dare. If aunt Malee knows, we'd be in trouble. Then, you stay here, I'll go for dad. I... I'm afraid. Are you going to make me believe that those ghost birds killed this shaman? Nonsense. You shouldn't believe such a thing. It sounds impossible, but I assure you that teacher isn't a murderer. - Give me time, I will prove to you. - How? Catch a ghost for me? I think so. - Phop... - What? I hope she won't move back to Bangkok. Don't worry. She won't move anyway. I can assure you that. You can interrogate her anytime, anywhere. He didn't believe it, right? - What should we do? - We must find a proof. Have you told him about the wand? Waste to talk. He won't believe it anyway. This wand must have some power to scare that ghost. - Found him? - No, even at the house. Just forget him. If he's not dead, we can't raise him anymore. He embarrasses us all over. See how you let him help you, huh. What should we do now? Let's go home. I'll apologize to the ghost after this. Where's everyone? Mom... mom... What the hell? Who's that? Lorr? Don't you kid me. Open it! You're looking for trouble now. Open it! Now! Open it, or I'll kick you. Will you open it? Damn! Who's that? Help! Ghost! I've been waiting for you. Don't, don't. Don't, don't. Don't, don't. What happen in there? It's Mol's sound. What's wrong with you, Mol? Mol, where are you? When did you be back? Mol, Mol... What? My Mol! I'm ready sir. No, I have more jobs for you to do. You can't die now. No, I won't do it. I won't do it, no matter how you force me. Don't you care of your dad and sister anymore? But, you told me you need only Mol's life and that's it? You lie to me! But, you must do what I order. You have no choice. No, I won't. - You must. - I won't. - Look into my eyes. - No, no. - You go get the corporal. - Yes. Who did this to you? Mol. Don't touch him. If you don't mind, I want you to stay here for a night with us. Yes, sir. - Thank you so much. - It's alright. Make yourself comfortable. I'll find you a cup of coffee. Please, don't bother. It's alright. It doesn't take much time. Hey, that's Lorr's urn. Leave me alone. Damn ghost! Greedy ghost! Where are you? Here's your money. Come and get it. Lawan... My son! What's wrong with you? Stop! Let me go. Come and get it. You destroy my urn. You die! I'm not afraid of you. Get back here. Let's go inside. What the hell are you thinking? I will fight him! Let me go! Malee. Let me go! Just listen to me, dammit. Damn ghost! What? It's me. No, Malee. You broke it. Malee. No, Malee. No, Malee. Malee. What happen now? Malee. Why won't you listen to me? I can't believe, and I don't want to. You're too stubborn. The proof is right here and you still don't believe it? Let's find the way to get rid of him. - What do you think? - My duty is to catch the crook, not ghost. You do whatever you want. Stop asking me already. I have enough headache already. - Can you do anything about this, Luan? - Too hard. His power is so strong. I can't fight him. I think we'd better discuss with the abbot. It's Leang's soul. His soul was subdued there for 20 years now. It was what he wanted. I don't understand. Yes, I'm puzzled now. It's this. The shaman and Khmer man are friends. They were also have both high skill of magic power. Before the Khmer died, he asked the shaman to subdue his soul to that hill he loved. I tried to stop him, but the shaman didn't want to deny his friend's ask. So, his soul was subdued there. The gold coin was casted the spell to subdue the soul. So, the soul wouldn't go anywhere. If the gold coin was out of his mouth, the soul will be released. There must be someone has taken that coin out. It was my son. He wanted money to but sweets without thinking. So, he took the gold coin out of his mouth. Dad, the urn must be the same as Lorr's pot. Do you know where the urn is? I don't know. The shaman told me before he died that it was burried. But, I don't know where too. Do we have any way to suppress this fierce soul? The shaman told me some methods. I think we still have a chance. But, I don't know if we'll succeed. The soul must be so strong. Even the shaman can't fight him. I think we should be together raying for the success of these mission. I found it. OK, listen to me. No matter what you see or hear, don't panic. Think only of Buddha, and don't let the holy strings off of your neck. - Understand? - Yes. Luan, open the coffin. No corpse. But, it was there when I came here. You two come up now. Everyone stays behind me. Birds... They're coming again. He comes that way. Oh shit. Everyone stays calm. You think you can get rid of me? How can it be? I'm here, abbot. Do you want to catch me? Come on. You may scare everyone, but not me. You'd be glad to leave this world for the next birth. I don't want it. - Why do you have to resist your own karma? - I told you I don't want it. Fine. Then, I have to force you. You may try. Everyone, don't look at his eyes. Close your eyes. You wanna be dead? It's your sin that deteriorate your power. See, you can't do any harm to me. Give up! Please, sir. Have mercy on me. I was bullied first. They stole my property. They destroyed my soul's urn. If I get caught, I'd be back to hell and punished. I ran away from them. Please, have mercy. When you do sins, you must accept the punishment. Don't, don't. Please, have mercy. I promise I won't hurt anyone again. Don't do this... Don't put me back to hell. Don't, don't. Abbot, watch out. Don't take the holy thread out of your neck. Use the flashlight. You won't give up, will you? Better let me go down. Tell me what to do then. You must stick this magic wand into his heart. But, there's no body. The body is still in there. But... But, there isn't... It's an illusion. He tries to deceive us. His body is still at the same place. Concentrate hard. Yes. Here. Be careful. I go down with you. You'll all die. I won't let anyone lives. Put it back in his mouth as it was. You better find woods. We'll cremate him. Yes, sir. - What are you waiting for? - It smells so bad, sir. Just finish it. Please, forgive for all our deeds of each others. You all better go back. I'll stay to pray for his soul to the next world. Let us help you on this too. We were also wrong to bother him too. OK, as you want. The End
