Look at the camera. On three! I'd rather kill myself than do this twice. - I want to do it now. - Are you insane? We're shooting! Please show me what you got. - Too many people around. - Please. Get ready for a good time tonight. This is just an exhibition game. When the regular season starts, I will turn you on with my spectacular skills. Can't wait! - Joo-yeong! - Tae-gyoo! - Honey? - Yeah? I want a handsome son who looks like me. What? No way. - We don't have a lot of time left. - I hate kids. I won't marry you if I have to have a child. What? Tell me why. I love you. How romantic! He proposed to her. Lovers of Jeju Island? What a tacky title! - Oldie but a goodie. - How long are they together? Five years. - Should we get married? - Why now? We've been dating for seven years. Cool. Let's do it. Welcome to Sea World at the 63 Building. Now it's time for the water ballet show. Please welcome the mermaid princess! A big round of applause, please. Where should we have the wedding? Don't worry, next time you'll receive some camel meat. It is good for leisure and pleasure. Then let's have it in Seoul. What about the date? - We'll do a Russian wedding. - Stop. Russian style is quite sensual. Come here. Mom, take a taxi! Let's go that way. Go on. Follow her moves. PREGNANCY JOURNAL I don't expect anything from you. Just thought you should know since you're the father. Wait! Let's get married! I don't want a marriage just because of a baby. When did we first meet? One month is about 800 hours? For some, maybe it's too short, but for me, enough time to fall in love. I want to be with you for 8,000, no, 80,000 hours! Say yes! Say yes! Kiss him! MARRIAGE BLUE You're so beautiful. This way. Hello, Dad. You really won't get a minister? How about a benediction at least? You're a reverend's daughter. That's why we picked a wedding hall that looks like a church. - Can we move on, please? - But this doesn't feel… Why? You don't like your little girl getting married? - Where are you? - My gown! Dad, I gotta go. What is it? My gown is gone. The ball gown with a deep neck and lots of beads. - The sexy one. - That one? That was bought by another bride. - What's going on here, Ms. Kang? - I'm sorry. - She's also your client. - You mean Vika Alexandrovna? - You can't go in! - Oh, my. There's been a mistake. - I picked this one first. - Sorry, I like this too. I'm sorry too, but I won't compromise. You're pretty and you'll look good in any gown. But I need a good gown. Let me have it. We will see… Ladies, please calm down. I will give it up if it looks better on you. What is she saying? You try, I try. The prettier one gets it. How do I look? Why does it keep falling down? Give me some pads. More. Oh, no… We all need to be happy for a happy occasion. You take it. I don't want to fight. Thank you! So pretty! This is why I keep coming back to you. Can't you just keep working? He doesn't want me to. Of course. You're too precious to do others' nails. It's not that. He wants me to take a break. You're making me jealous. NOTICE FOR CLOSURE I might sit down with Choi Won-cheol for an interview. Really? He must be thrilled! I thought you're a fool to be with a sous chef. Who knew he would make it big? Good thing you stayed with him. You'll probably regret quitting your job though. Women always lose in marriage. I got these from the fish market this morning. - Gross! - You said you craved them. I just felt like it after seeing others eating it. I really cannot eat this stuff. Gross, I touched it. I didn't know. I thought you like them. Have you eaten? Still having morning sickness? Too bad you can't eat anything. - You should eat something. - That's not the problem. My dad is the real problem. I should hide it from him until the wedding. I think we'd better tell him. Didn't I tell you I took a vow of chastity? My dad thinks I am the purest girl in the world. A minister's daughter getting pregnant before marriage? It's nonsense! The best solution is get married first and pretend this baby was born premature. Right, you managed to hide the fact that you partied for ten years. Say that again, and I will… - Have you decided what to sing? - I'm terrible at singing. - Why should the groom sing? - The groom has to sing! - But why the groom? - You said you'd do it. It feels awkward to see the groom sing at his own wedding. Let's dance together instead. - Hello, Mr. Yang. - I said I can't. Are you happy with the arch on the bridal path? - Sure. We're working on it. - Hey, look! - Morning, A-reum! - Hi, Vika! - Can I help? Want to move this in? - Sure, thanks! - Did you get the photo? - Of the ivy tunnel? - Yes, that one. - It'll suit the venue. - Look at her butt! - Hello? Yes. - Are you listening? - Let me call you back. - She's hot. - Stop ogling and get back to work. - I missed you, honey. - Me too. Hold on. What brings you here? I came to see my sexy guy. I said, get back to work! The sill is a trouble. Hey, push harder. Come with me. I told you to cover up. He is one lucky fellow. MIN SEONG-UK IM TAE-GYU Look at those guys from Minor. You trained them well. They are doing good! Did you ask the manager's daughter to sing at my wedding? - He said not to worry. - It's a done deal? - Yes. - Awesome! - Stop that! - I love you so much! Stop it! Are you that happy? Can't be more excited! Mr. Im Tae-gyoo! - Must be your fan. - See? People still remember me. Up here! It's me, Seon-ok. - What? Piggy, is that you? - Don't call me that! - It's been two years since I lost weight! - Whatever. I came here to cover your cheerleading team, then I thought about you. Heard you're coaching the minor league team? The manager and fans still wanted me to play, but I wanted to give the younger guys a chance. That's right! You're better as a coach, aren't you? - Let's talk later. - Do you keep in touch with Joo-yeong? I haven't heard from her in ages. Is Joo-yeong still single? What are you on about? - Joo-yeong, here comes your man! - You won today. - Yes! - Great. I also got the confirmation for the wedding singer! Really? A famous singer at our wedding? - Seriously. - So cool! What a bummer. I practiced real hard. Don't even think about it. Is it for me? Tae-gyoo, put it down. Wait until the wedding. - Just a quick peek. - Don't you dare. - You'll regret it. - Okay. See? I put it down right here. I met Seon-ok today. - Who? - Ko Seon-ok. Don't you remember that fat girl who chased me around? Right. She's lost a lot of weight. I didn't recognize her. It must have cost her a fortune. What's this? Is it new? Can we at least have the benediction? My mom's really into the religious stuff. I agreed to not having a minister so cut me some slack on this one. Then I'll pick the honeymoon destination, I saw it a long time ago. - Where is it? - I want to go far away. HONEYMOON IN VENICE ITINERARY I let you hire a limo. How about a resort in Southeast Asia? Venice is too far away. Why pay lots of money just to bum around? We must get our money's worth. Do you know pregnant women have to sign a form to get on the plane? So what? I'll sign! I'm not forcing you to do things my way. - I didn't say that. - You sure are acting like it. I'm not the only control freak here. Control freak? I can't believe this. Don't tickle me, I have to focus. What do we do for fun once we get married? Marriage isn't about fun, but about being partners. I knew it! No point fantasizing about marriage. We've been through good and bad. That's what brings a couple together. Is this about you quitting your job? I really wanted to win the contest. Good. It can be done this way. - I have to go to Jeju Island. - The wedding is only a week away. A relative of mine who lives there is feeling bad because she's sick and can't make it to our wedding. - I have to go visit her. - Who? Someone you haven't met. - Okay. - Thank you! Hey, watch out! What's so good about this water bed? It's uncomfortable and expensive. I loved it when we had sex on it. All right. Time to sleep. - I'm tired. - Hey, Mister. - Aren't you tired? - No. - I'm exhausted. - I'm not. This bed really turns you on. Honey, it's weird. Yes, my thing is… No! I'm just tired since I'm getting some new plants for the store. And sex tends to slow down a bit before the wedding. - Does it? - Yes, it's a Korean thing. Seon-ok. Am I bold or what? Are you running away? No, it's for the contest. I'll return as a champion. Sightseeing is extra. Promise not to tell him. - What will I get in return? - I'll get you a nice souvenir. Where is he? WELCOME MS. OH SO-RI Are you from the travel agency? - Ms. Oh So-ri? - It's So-mi. Oh, Mi! Oh So-mi? I'm Han Gyeong-su, your guide for the next three days. I booked a one-on-one tour by taxi. I know but there's a double booking with a group. It's the same route. Let's share a ride until the morning. What? No way! - Are you really from the agency? - Yeah. The office must have messed up. It's only a day and a half. Complaining does no good to you or the travel agent who will probably get disciplined. Still, this isn't right! I think having company triples the fun. - Welcome! - Welcome on board! - You're so pretty! - Get in already. All right. - Geon-ho, breakfast is ready. - Good, I'm so ready for frozen food. This is good for men. Help yourself. Isn't it eel? Wait, I need some water. Geon-ho, what does "stamina" mean? Stamina? I forgot to make a flower basket. It's an urgent order. - You eat. Damn, I have to miss the eel. - What? - Go ahead. - At least have a bite! Why are you moaning? You'll survive! Boss! That one looks dead. Why don't you chuck it out? It's not dead! I can erect it. I mean, I can revive it! - It's definitely dead. - I'll revive it. You won the world championship at a young age with fusion Korean cuisine. - All eyes are on you. - It still feels surreal. And you're getting married this week? - Congratulations. - Thank you. - The office isn't open today? - How would I know? Are you serious? Can you share your secret to having a long and steady relationship and getting married? I guess cooking and marriage are quite similar. Only till the morning? Cooking doesn't always follow a recipe. - We'll pay you back. - You better! It depends on how you combine the ingredients. The same goes for marriage. It's about how rather than who. The key is not love, but how to live your marriage. Let's say you're a morning person, and your spouse is a night owl. It could kill you. You don't eat meat? Is she a meat lover or a vegetarian? Does she squeeze the toothpaste from the middle or the bottom? Does she snore? Being in a relationship is the process of checking small details to see if two people could live together. Can you check those with me? What? Careful, ladies. - Watch your step. - Thanks. You're not coming? Watch out. - Here you go. - These are so fresh. I'm starving. Move two steps to the right. One more step! - Make sure it's a good shot! - Two! Thanks for the great tour, Mr. Han! Is everyone here? Look, I've been trying to be nice. But this is getting ridiculous. Am I a tour guide? Why am I doing your job? I'm an idiot for doing your job. I was so happy to see someone my age here. Would it kill you to help me a little? Of your age? Are you kidding? You look at least ten years older. It's only three years. Do you think you're that young? - Ladies! - Yes? - Let's hit the road again! - Let's go! Should I go up first? - Please. - Okay. I am so sorry. I'll follow you no matter what. Text me when you feel better. She ignored my texts again! Should I marry her? We are hardly on the same page. And she's such a Janus pretending to be a good girl for her dad while partying every night. She has too many faces, which scares me. I fell for her for that though. The biggest problem is she won't do it till the wedding. She won't even let me touch her. Is it normal for your partner to act weird as the wedding nears? I need your advice. Hello. Is this your first visit? - Yes. - What are your symptoms? PATIENT INFORMATION CAN'T GET IT UP I see. Write down your name and identification number. And please wait. Yes. Sorry. Thank you. The symptoms started recently. I was okay until I got my wedding invites printed. - No problem before then? - Never! It looks like a psychological problem. Why don't you discuss it with your fiancée first? No way! That's not an option. Why not? She's new to the country. She has just me to rely on. Okay, let me take a look. - Look at what? - Pants down. Okay. - The briefs too. - Yes. Is there a male doctor? Lie down. Let me begin. Holy crap! Wait. Hold on. - Reaction seems normal. - Don't swing it, please. It seems fine. Did you say she's from Uzbekistan and 18 years younger than you? Yes. Are you feeling insecure? It looks like you're having wedding blues. Sure… What? - Wipe yourself. - Okay. PLEASE TAKE A NUMBER Number 28, please. Hello, how can I help you today? I think my flower is hiding something lately. Look at those long legs! Maybe I don't cook well? You are young and pretty. And he wants you to cook? - Men became unbelievable. - Should I feed him a snake soup? - Number 1009, please. - Here! That's good that you solved all your visa problems with this marriage. And what about you? Nothing new? - Here is your marriage certificate. - Thank you so much. Some change for charity. What? She was married? BAE JU-YEONG DIVORCED Bae Joo-yeong, you… - What's wrong with him? - Sir, are you okay? Two boxes of tangerines will be delivered tomorrow. Tangerines coming in tomorrow. Make kimchi with them. Yes, chef! Chef, why the sudden foreigner lessons? To try my recipes, train students, and earn some quick money. He's the best. Excuse me, we're on a break. - We reopen at 5 p.m. - Well, I'm here… Can I help you? I'm here for this. Look at this! I picked all of them! Ms. Oh! You paid for this activity too! Pick some or you'll regret it. Come on! Hey! - He's so good. - Am I good or what? What is he anyway? - I'll be right back. - Should I buy this? - Isn't it pretty? - It is! Hey! Look at you, asshole. You look like shit! "Shit"? Are you serious? Go to hell! You go to hell! You're dead meat! Are you nuts, you psycho? Want a tight slap? I'll rip your eyes out! Fucking moron! No, it's not… - Damn it! - Wait. What did I do? So-mi, look outside. It's breathtaking! That poor giraffe. Don't even start. Your vocabulary amazes me. - I said don't. - That giraffe… Stop the car! Let me get off. - I was asking about the price. - Let me out! - Don't fight. - I can't stand you! - Why are you getting off? - It's the middle of nowhere! You can't find a ride here. You son of a bitch! Hello, Dr. Kim, did you get the invite? Yeah, I know I'm being mean. Thanks. I'm going to tell him soon. He'll understand. I'll call you back. Hey, I didn't know you were coming. Who was it? Was it Dr. Kim? I sent him the invitation. Are you still jealous? I told you he's just a friend. - You're not that busy today. - No. Did you have lunch? Yes, I did. I went to City Hall. To register our marriage. Turns out what Piggy told me was true. She caught the bouquet at your first wedding? I'm so sorry. I tried to tell you but I couldn't. You couldn't and you're sorry? Sorry for what? Having been married or for lying to me? How can you do this to me? This is fraud. I should sue you! I am so sorry. I was afraid to lose you again after all these years. Right. The photoshoot must have been easy. Did you strike the same pose? Did you practice those wonderful skills in bed with him? It's not like that. How long did it last? Do you have a kid I don't know about? Is that why you don't want a baby with me? - It's not like that. I can explain. - Don't! I don't want to hear a word. I was too naive. I should have known how you lived for the last 12 years. Let's call it off. How come it's so easy for you? None of this is my fault. Tae-gyoo! Tae-gyoo, wait! This place is so deserted. I'm starving. Stop! I'm sorry. I just thought the giraffe is cute. I will make up for the time you lost. - Get in. We'll have pork for dinner. - Get in! You don't want it? Imagine the crispy grilled tilefish, steamed pork, fried flatfish, and spicy seaweed noodles - over a glass of soju! - Sounds delicious! How about that? Let's have grilled tilefish with soju! - Come on, So-mi! - Get in quick! Wait! Take me with you! You're not angry anymore? Then why didn't you text me? I was just a bit disappointed, that's all. Here! It's clothes! I swear I will be good to you. By the way, do you really love me? Of course, I love you. That's why I am here with you. You have such sexy ears, you know that? My ears? Don't move. Dae-bok, wait! Hold on! Didn't I ask you to wait until we get married because I feel guilty about this? I know. But today's special. I want to make you feel good. Let's talk in our new house, on our new bed. What do you say? - Just talking. - Promise? I-ra, I've waited too long. - I'm madly in love with you. - Wait. Shit! - Mom! - Good evening, Mom. - What are you doing here? - Hello. Come on in. When did you come? I knew it! As Dae-bok is the eldest son in the family, I furnished this big house. How come you kept the place so empty? I brought in some furniture. - Come on, Mom. - Thank you so much. What are those? I got them from the store down the street. You can pay them tomorrow. And as you know, we're a big family. You should buy gifts for all of them. Even for the youngsters. - Do you understand? - Yes. - If only your mother was here to… - Mom! You scared me! - Stop talking nonsense. - But I'm asking you for a luxury bag like other mothers-in-law do. Your family and relatives are all from Seoul. We're having the wedding in Seoul because of you, so you have to pay the travel expenses for our folks, right? - Sure. - One more thing. See that amulet over there? It's for your marital harmony. Don't throw it away. Or you'll have bad luck. What? The fortuneteller said she'll bring you bad luck... It's late. - Let's go home. - I lost track of time. Wait, I almost forgot! I put powdered cream and sugar in the cupboard. - We don't need it. - No one makes coffee that way anymore. Don't be silly. It's not coffee without powdered cream and sugar. - Got it. - It's too bitter otherwise. - I got it, Mom. - Let me finish! And what's that… Please leave! This is not bad. - This place is creepy. - Really? Scared? Ask him to stay with you. - Good night, ladies! - Good night. Don't tell me this place is haunted. Sure it is. How did you know? I hate horror movies. The ghost in the closet is very scary. Hey, watch out! Don't be so dramatic. Call me if you're too scared. Psycho… Damn it… No ghosts yet? It may pop up if you open the closet. Press the third button to your right. You must be tired. There's some bath salts in the closet. It will be soothing. A bachelor ghost appeared! He doesn't look too bad. I think I can survive. Hey. What's wrong with you? You're so gentle! Look, on your shoulder! Do that again, and I'll kill you. You really won't ride it? - I won't! - Come on. How can you survive when you're so skittish? I'm doing just fine! Try it. It's fun! - Enjoy yourself. - All right. - Hold him tight! I'm so jealous. - He's such a gentleman. - It's better, isn't it? - Well, yes. You're getting special treatment. I rarely go tandem. I didn't ask for it. I didn't want you to feel left out and you paid for the activity. - What are you really? - A tour guide. You're not from the agency. You don't use the Jeju dialect. You don't seem professional or trustworthy as a guide. I saw you cheating at the historic site earlier. You have a sharp eye. Just call me a part-timer. What do you really do? Why are you so curious? Are you into me? What? In your dreams! Giddy up! I want a ride with him. Stop hogging him! You would've been still playing if you hit this well! Your wife will love you more if you're stronger! Harder! Deeper! Harder! Longer! Till the deep end! Harder! Damn it! Harder! Great! Faster! Lower body strength is the key! King of the night! - No time for a shower? You stink. - Who cares? Did you eat? Order something. I might throw up if I eat looking at you. I'm in a rush. Let me be quick then. What does he do? When, how and where did you meet him? Why the divorce? Do you still talk to him? Is his bigger than mine? Is he better in bed? Did you ever orgasm with him? How often? More often than with me? Do you love him more than me? Tell me! I'll decide after you tell me. What about her? What was she like? What did she do? Right, she was a model. You met her on the field when she threw the first pitch. Lived together for three years and eight months. Why did you break up? She got famous and dumped you? Do you still talk to her? How was she in bed? Better than me? Any skills in bed? Did you love that bitch? How much? More than me? You also did a photoshoot. You did a good job with that. My bad! I am sorry for what I did. But I guess we're even here. How did you know? You were a promising rookie. Everyone talked about it. You hit rock bottom after the break-up and ended your career after getting hit by a ball. You knew all this and pretended not to know? I believed you would be okay with my past because I was. You were? I'm not a saint. I'm not okay with it. You played me. I see it clearly now. The wedding is off. I will never marry you! Have a good life! - What? - Bitch! Unbelievable. There's too much left. I can't carry them back home. You're staying one more night. Share with him. - You don't have to. - Thank you, ladies. Help yourselves. Have fun and don't fight. I want to give you something. - What's all this? - It's so pretty. - She's good! - It's like magic. You're an artist. - I want my nails done. - What? No way! "An artist"? Sir, how are you feeling today? - Come this way. - Yes. Doctor says it's a psychological thing. But I want to try medication since I'm in a hurry. Right, you're getting married soon. It's a tough time. I was so eager to get married too. But once the date was set, all we do is argue. And I keep questioning myself. - So I'm not the only one. - Right. You have no problem down there? Of course not! I'm young and energetic! - Good for you. - Don't be too depressed. You can get it up again. It's a bit cold. Here we go. - Relax. - Okay. - We need to talk! - What the hell? - I'm sorry. - Can he barge in like that? - Can't you see I'm working? - Hey! Excuse me… I've been thinking, Dr. Kim knows about your past, right? - Hey. - I was suspicious. How could you share such intimate details with him? - Doctor? - He knows. We used to work together. So what? - "So what"? - Should I pull up my pants? Go. I have no time for this. - Can you... - Lie down! Okay, let's put that aside. I can't understand one thing. - Doctor? - How are we even? What's the difference? - You lived with her. - Shall I come back? One year versus three years. Tell me which is longer. Let me pull my pants up. - Hold... - Look at you. I'm clean on paper. How can it be the same? Would it have been okay with you if I'd just lived with him? What should I… Men and women are different! It's okay for me, but not for you. You don't have to yell like that. I didn't know you are such a jerk. Can I pull up my pants? Why are you taking me? Don't do this! Let me remove the difference between men and women from you. Somebody stop her! - Come here! - Doctor! - She stabbed me! - For real? - Yes! - Are you crazy? Damn it. - What is this? - She's crazy. Why did you pull me down? Move over. She's nuts. - You and I are over! - I still have the gel all over me. What shall I do with this? Hello? Excuse me, doctor? I still have the gel on. Hello? Yes, Father! The gown suits you so well. Isn't the silhouette too simple? - I want something more glamorous. - Try them all. You cannot try all men, but you can try every gown. Then I'll look around a bit more. This one looks good! She's unbearable. How can you stand her? - Hello. - Hello. - Delivery for Choi Won-cheol. - Okay. WOMEN'S CENTRAL KO SEON-OK Can I have some water? Water? Sure. - Where did you learn Russian? - It's so hot. - I learned while traveling. - Here you go. - Thanks. - You're so talented! There's still lot to learn. You're great too. - Thanks. - Okay, now… Goodbye. Thank you. Let's do this first. There's not one good picture. - See you tomorrow. - See you. - Working on a wedding video? - No, this is… Let me see that. For your own wedding? It must be a masterpiece. - See you tomorrow, Do-a. - Bye. I envy them. I need to see you now at our new house! What's wrong with your dad? I'm a grown man with my own convictions and values. How can he ask me to convert before the wedding? I even memorized the hymnbook to impress him. I promised to try my best to get out of it, but... Isn't it natural for him? You said you understand. But it's too much! How can I convert overnight? He can still match you with a guy from his church! He doesn't know what you're doing outside. What do you mean? Your family is no better. Your mom called again to blame me for having a fight with her son. She told me to forgo my religion. I'm a grown woman with my own convictions. How can she ask me that? If she doesn't like me, she can find a better match for you. Why pick on me for everything? Like her son is the best man out there! She did? And look at this house. I am the one who has to live here! I don't like the furniture. Her taste is a bit tacky. Why didn't you tell her that? I'm good with whatever you want. Want to change everything? It's always the same story. - We should reconsider… - Not again! You promised me not to. In life, there comes a time when you should be calm. I guess this is that time for me. It's so tacky. I-ra, wait! You can't just leave! - Geon-ho. - Yes? - We need to talk. - Yes, Vika! You better be prepared for a sleepless night. - I'm serious. - I'll show you I still got it! - What are you doing, honey? - Wait a second. Geon-ho, listen to me. - Stay still. - Honey! My parents' visa application got rejected. I love your parents… Geon-ho? My parents' visa got rejected. They can't come to the wedding. What should we do? Are you asleep? Isn't this where the first date was shot on Lovers of Jeju Island? Bingo! So am I making up for your ruined tour? So you do read online comics. That one is such a masterpiece. Are you taking a picture? No, I'll capture it with my eyes. - You're quite good at your job. - I quit a few days ago. - Why? - I have my reasons. Such a shame. What a waste. You seemed pretty talented. Why didn't you request a guide? You have an evening flight. You have plans? Do you have any plans for tomorrow? You already regret not booking me for tomorrow. - I'm going to the zoo. - To the zoo? To see giraffes. I'm going to kill you! A typhoon is landing earlier than expected! - Let's hurry. - Okay. I can change it to a better hotel. This place is not bad. - I made friends with ghosts. - As if. By the way, I'm available tomorrow. I will be your tour guide tomorrow. Good night. MY CHEF These are the pictures you chose. Which one should we put at the entrance? Are you sure I chose them? Yes, but if you don't like… Wait! I specifically requested you to cover up the pimples! What about the fat on my arms? You don't like it? No, I hate it! Edit them again! Please come in. - You need an elevator. - Think of it as a workout. Is it my fault that you have chubby arms? I've never seen her like that. A typical bride-to-be. - You mean I'm like that? - No, you're an angel. - You know! - Of course. Why is it so messed up? I really wanted my wedding to be perfect. I am so sorry, sir. She's never been like this before. - Here you go. - She prescribed you sleeping pills. She's been out of it lately. - Is this the right one? - Yes. Is something going on? Why is it so hard to get married? You didn't know that? All married men are great. I feel like we're speaking different languages although she's Korean. How can I live with her? - I'm talking to a real foreigner. - Sorry? Try to be upfront with her. I can't. She might leave me. We're in a rush to get married because I insisted on it. I should just embrace it. Here. These are tickets to the aquarium. Treat her. Try to calm her down. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it! - Enjoy yourselves. - Have a few more of these. We covered it for the last issue and got a great reaction. - What? - Why did they get divorced? How the hell do I know? I lost touch since she went to the U.S. I like it here. Let's take a look. Just tell me who her ex is! I want to see him! Don't make me tell Joo-yeong you used to hit on me back then. This is not good. I'll just go see him, that's all. DOCTOR KIM BUM-SIK Shit! Dr. Kim is the ex? How did this ugly prick marry her? Mr. Im? Let me take a look. It seems okay to me. Does it? Is mine better than yours, pervert? - Excuse me? - I'll go if you say it's good. By the way, Doc. Isn't mine adorable? What? He is a pervert! He forced me to lie down and put my penis in his mouth… - Is he a real doctor? - He's a criminal! What? He's lying! - This is the fish market. - Right. What's that? - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Do you like seafood like octopus or shells? - I love them! - You do? What the hell is he doing? What should we buy? How about sea squirts? - What are you doing here? - Oh, hi. - I have a delivery nearby. - I see. Hey, is that your boss? He looks so young. My boss? - He made it quite young. - Is he single? - He's getting married next week. - Is he? - Yes. - Next week? - I see. Okay. - I have to go. Hurry! Two minutes to wrap up the nail-art competition. Do you smell something sweet? Yes, I do. - Isn't it great? - It is. This is the crucial point, watch it carefully. So, well… Now I see how it should be done. Please leave your message after the beep. The second prize for nail-art goes to… Ms. Bae Yu-ri! Way to go, Oh So-ri! And the grand prize goes to Oh So-ri! Oh So-ri! Here comes the mermaid princess! A big applause, please. She's starting ten consecutive turns! Look at that! The mermaid says hello to you. Please wave back! This is the so-called whirlpool posture. You are here in the 63 Sea World where you can see the imaginary ocean with colorful stories and exciting shows! - Good thing we came here, right? - Get off me! Every sea creature and diver… It's not what you think. What's wrong? - What are you doing? - Let go. - Are you a pervert? - No, let go! - What's wrong? - Seriously! - Perv. - I-ra! Let go of me! - Let me go. Wait! - Come with us! Did I do something wrong? I just wanted us to get closer. And you made me feel like a pervert in public? You almost hit me, didn't you? I'm trying hard to get closer to you. You only talk about the wedding. Marriage comes first, doesn't it? Sometimes you are like a total stranger to me. Stranger? Me? What about you, Mr. Yes Man? You know what they call you? What? A pushover? Better than being two-faced. You said "two-faced"? When are you going to stop living a double life? You know a lot about me. But you know what? I know nothing about you. I know nothing about your school days, your job, or your dreams. I have no clue about my future husband! And you half-ass everything. You can get to know each other by living together. No one gets married knowing everything about one another. I… I'm scared. What if I get hurt or this isn't the right choice? What if I end up relying on my child like my dad? I am scared of everything. You're good at making a list, aren't you? Make a list of why we shouldn't get married. I'll go away if it convinces me. How about that? I should have won first place. You told me participating was good enough. I was just saying. I should win something because I came here in secret. - Why secretly? - Somebody doesn't like it. - Thinks he's a big shot now. - Who are you talking about? - Who are you then? - Me? Excuse me. Can I get your autograph? - Sure. - I'm Choi Su-a. Thank you! - He's handsome! - I know, right? Who are you really? You say you read Lovers of Jeju Island. Sure, I even get notifications for the updates. You don't recognize the writer of your favorite cartoon? What? - Ring a bell? - You look exactly like him! Mr. Author, some questions from your fan. - Are they getting married? - I won't spoil it for you. - Break them up! - Why? They've been together too long! How's that a reason? Hear me out. If they're together too long, they stop having butterflies. Do they have to get married just because they're together for long? That's too boring. You've never been in love. That's why you don't get it. How long have they been together? Five years? They have a long way to go. They will see that eventually. Okay, I will think about it. You know what? I might sound too naive but… I still believe love results in marriage. A love that I can give up everything for. Even my life and my career. When did she drink all of this? Hey, wake up! You'll miss your flight! Here you go! Thank you. They are beautiful! You look familiar. Have we met somewhere? - Me? - Yes. I retired ages ago though. I can't do a photo today. I'm dealing with a personal issue. - I remember seeing you… - Thank you! Take care! The migrant workers protested asking the extension of stay… - Boss! - Yes? Isn't that Vika? They demanded the abolition of the employment license system and raised their voices on legislation to improve working conditions. The line is busy, yet she seems peaceful. Hello! Wake up! Chipped nails? What's up? Where are we? We're heading to the airport. I'm not sure if we can make it though. Really? Worst case, I will get you the first flight tomorrow. I really have to go today. You didn't seem to care when you were snoring. Bullshit! - I don't snore. - Yes, you do. - No way! - You were even drooling. Come this way, quick! It's pouring buckets. Sorry, I couldn't find a room elsewhere. You know it's part of my scheme? Sure, but the typhoon was a bit over the top. Wait a second. - Here you go. - Thanks. Call home first and get some rest. I'm sorry but the planes are not taking off tonight. - Why did you go in the first place? - I didn't see it coming. We were supposed to arrange the fabrics I bought. - I'm sorry. - Come home safe. Let me help you! Vika! Why did you… Are you okay? - What? I'm just tired. - I see. - Let's go inside. - No. - I'll go straight home. - Yeah? Good night. What's this? Why is it outside? She's not home? How could you go see Dr. Kim? I didn't realize I almost married a childish, pathetic jerk. I'll do what you want. Let's call off the wedding! "Childish, pathetic jerk"? How did she find out anyway? Who says you can call it off? Is that why my bike is outside? Open up right now, or we're really done! You're going to regret this. Message recording cancelled. Shit… Damn it! I know you're in there! Open the door! You really didn't have to. I told you to stay inside. I'm not selfish enough to stay warm inside when the owner is out in the pouring rain. Why didn't I realize that you're a such a nice girl? You must be cold. How are your hands? Oh, no! Your pretty nails are ruined. It's fine. I can do them up again. May I try? Excuse me, miss. You're totally messing up the lines. You don't like it, ma'am? What should I do? Fix it or I won't come back here. Please cut me some slack. How's that? It's the one from the cartoon. He proposed with this… You like it? Are you kidding me? Then what do you like? Come to think of it, I know nothing about you. Things you like… or where you want to fly away to… I want to know it all. "I'd like to see you." Sir, I'd like to see you. We're in trouble… We might get in big trouble… Let's close for the day! What? Shit! LOL LMFAO FUCK No! Oh, my god! Finish whatever you were doing. What are you shy about? I saw everything last night. You were aggressive last night and now… Sorry? I'll piss you off again. I booked a ticket for you. Let's eat and go to the airport. Look, Gyeong-su. I'm going to Seoul this weekend. Let's meet then. HOW TO GET A VISA THROUGH MARRIAGE - Are you going somewhere, Vika? - Yes, to run a few errands. - See you later. - Bye. - I'm going out. - Are you? Well… - Vika. - Right! Okay. Bye. Susu Flowers. We ran out of flowers today. Boss, these are flowers! We are here. Gyeong-su, I can't see you this weekend. Then how about weekdays? I'm getting married this weekend. I'm so sorry. Why do Koreans like soybean paste stew? I can't stand the smell. It may smell terrible at first. But how romantic is it to cook one for your loved one. I'll suffocate myself trying to be romantic. - Vika. - Yes? - What do you think? - It's so pretty! Will a girl like it? Of course! Vika! I knew it! What do you think you're doing? Geon-ho, what are you doing here? - I wanted to surprise you. - What are you hiding from me? It was supposed to be a secret. Why are you angry? - Let's go outside and talk. - Sir, it's not what you think. Shame on you! You're getting married this week. - Are you tempted by a pretty girl? - You're going too far. I'm her husband. Was it your plan be with a young guy like this after marrying me for a visa? Why did you choose him in the first place? Stop! You're embarrassing me. Come back! Vika! Don't run away! Are you ashamed of me? He's her husband? No wonder he feels insecure. CONS AGAINST MARRYING HIM You are here! I don't know what to say. You were such a perfect couple. - How much can I get back? - It's less than a half. I couldn't return this either because I used it once. I bought it to iron that jerk's shirts. What a waste of money. - Welcome... - Don't you believe me? Talk to me. Come back here! Why did you come to Korea? - Where were you yesterday? - Yesterday... Do I look stupid? Thought you could fool me? What are you talking about? I had something to do yesterday. But I don't want to talk about it. I came here for money but I have my pride. Yesterday had nothing to do with you. How can we live together if we're at odds like this? You won't let me finish! I took care of you when things were bad. How could you stab me in the back? Was this all part of your plan from the beginning? We're not getting married? Jeez, why don't you get it? Where are you going? I got you right or not? I knew that you… I am very stupid! What did you just say? Why talk in Russian? Just go to him rather than giving me hell! The clinic is closed. Her phone's turned off. Goddamnit! Who are you? You scared me. What are you doing here? I missed you so much. Hold me, honey. It's been only three days. Did you miss me so much? Come here. - How was the trip? - Good. What is it? You seem a little off. Let me look at you. Are you okay, So-mi? The list is so long! "Cons against marriage. Reason number one. He makes noise while drinking coffee." This is a deal-breaker? My bitchy ex-boss did it too. I hate it. Got it. I'll try not to use my sexy lips too much. "Number two. Tacky fashion sense." Am I tacky? I'm sometimes embarrassed to be seen with you. I won't wear them again. Problem solved. "Number three. The rocking chair from the second-hand shop." Can you bear with this one? I dreamed of having one when I got married someday. I want to sit there watching TV or putting our baby to sleep. I grew up in a strict family so I want my own home to be warm and cozy. Then buy a new one. - It's not a used one. - I hate it anyway. I spent a fortune to get it. What will happen after the wedding if we already argue like this? Okay, okay. No problem! I'll give it up. You are my number one priority. It's not about the chair. It's about me, right? You don't think you'll be happy with me? I doubt I'll be happy. We are already bickering. That shouldn't be happening. I just want you to be happy. All right. If it's too hard for you, let's do as you say. Let's reconsider our marriage. Let me ask you one thing. Do you even love me? Why you… I think you want to be alone. Let's say goodbye here. Where have you been? The clinic's closed. Your phone's off. I was worried to death. Wait, where is the ring? Stop it, I'm exhausted. Did you eat? Fuck eating! You're not the only one suffering here. My folks are going crazy. You should have told me. I told you I would call it off. As you wished! I thought about having the wedding to save money. But it didn't seem worth it. So you really cancelled it? Are you out of your mind? We will get married. We promised each other 12 years ago. It was you who broke that promise. Come here, sit. We need to talk. Please come here. Sit down for a minute. I am sorry. I don't know how to explain, but as far as I remember, you're not this kind of girl. Why didn't you stay married? Why were you dumped by such an old, pathetic baldy? "Not this kind of girl"? How about you when we dated before? You were an asshole. Do you know what you've put me through? How badly hurt I was? Hey, I don't have a kid. I had to leave the country because everyone knew it. What choice did I have? I was even pregnant! Pregnant? What do you mean? I lived with him in the U.S. It was only for a year, but he did everything he could. It wasn't easy to take care of a girl who lost someone else's baby. You were pregnant? Why didn't you tell me? I came to tell you after my surgery. But you were with that cute fangirl of yours. It was our baby. I lost it because of you. When you were having fun with her in my room… I was drunk. You said you want to have kids early in life? I can't do that for ten years. No, I can't have kids because I feel sorry about my lost child. I won't. I swore I wouldn't trust a man again. But I thought you were worth it. I thought I could trust you because you came back to me. I was fucking stupid. I should have seen it coming. I am terribly sorry. I had no idea. I didn't want you to know. I didn't want things to be this way. Can you leave now? Take whatever you want - and never come back. - Joo-yeong, please! Joo-yeong! Thanks to you, I smelt a lifetime's worth of soybean paste. It's my last gift! Stuff your face with it! - Did you buy a new car? - Yes, I got bored. - You should be careful today. - Why? Your jinx with un-ironed shirts. Remember when you broke your leg stealing a base? And when you were hit by a ball that ended your career. Also, when you were caught drunk driving. It was ages ago. You still seem to care, no? Joo-yeong irons them for me every day. Right, all the shit happened while she was not with you. Still, be careful anyway. You don't have to worry. They're small germs. I'll write a prescription. It should do the trick. - Thank you. - Plus, make sure to use condoms. Sure, thank you! Here's your prescription. It's dying. I watered it regularly and gave it nutrition as well. That's strange. It's quite an easy plant. What's the temperature? Temperature? It's 25 Celsius. I see the problem. That one's from Uzbekistan. Plants are just like people. You should provide a similar environment to its home. The person you have called is unavailable... I'll get it! Vika, is that you? This is Choi from Eoulrim Restaurant. She took a cooking class here. Don't misunderstand her. I know it's not my place but I had to tell you. How are you, sir? - Please have a seat. - Sit. My daughter isn't like that! How much do you know about her, sir? I raised her. Do you think I don't know her? To be honest, I spent much less time with her, but I think I know her much better… than you do. She knows it wasn't easy for you to raise her alone as a divorced minister. So she tried hard not to disgrace your name and not to disappoint you. She did everything your way. It's because of you that she led a double life. And now she wants to break up with me. I want to marry her not because she's pregnant with my child but because I really love her, sir. Please help me. I'm the only one who saw her for the person she is. I'm the only one who can make her happy and comfortable. Please persuade her, sir! Please help me! Sir! Sir! Father! My girl is so beautiful. I'll leave you two to have a moment. Wow, the bachelor ghost might come and get you. I was wondering who would marry this hysterical girl. You look worth the trouble. I miss you. Then why don't you fly over… right now? Excuse me, Sonya! - How did you get in here? - Where's Vika? She quit. She's going home. Hang on. She isn't taking my calls. Could you please tell her? I'm fine if it's a false marriage or if she used me. It's okay as long as I love her. Tell her to come back to me. Mr. Florist, she wasn't marrying you to stay here. She stayed here because she wanted to be with you. She gave up on her family. Family? What are you talking about? Vika already got her work visa, and she was only helping me. She suffered a lot as her family's visas got rejected. I'm sorry. Vika, don't go! I was such a fool! - What the hell? - Who are you? - Do you know him? - No. I'm so sorry. Excuse me! I'm enquiring about the 3 p.m. flight for Uzbekistan. - Did it take off yet? - Sorry? My fiancée is on that flight. I need to see her now. Can you please help? - Sir. - Yes. This is a domestic airport. - Seriously? - Yes. How come? Great! Give me a big smile! Just like that! Three, two, one! A wedding is strange. It makes me nervous again even though I spent 50 years with her. And it gives me butterflies. Ms. Kang. Sorry to bother you with so many calls. Don't be, sir. It's only natural. Three, two, one! It's so romantic. I wish… Are you crying? BOOK SIGNING BY HAN GYEONG-SU You are so handsome! Thank you! - Hi, what's your name? - Min Ju-hong. - Take care. - Thank you! My name is Oh So-ri. Congratulations. So you lied about the wedding? I guess we're even now. Wait, I'm not Oh So-mi. I'm Oh Bo-mi. I'm so sorry. Thanks. Thank you. Hello, I'm a huge fan! Bastard, you're the one who deserted her first. Childish, pathetic jerk! What's wrong with him? - Coach! - Tae-gyoo! - Are you okay? - Is he okay? - Do something! - Coach! Hey, wake up! Are you all right? - Get some water! - Coach! Joo-yeong… LOVERS OF JEJU ISLAND FINAL EPISODE MY CHEF Vika is leaving today. She was with me. Vika! Give it. Give me a minute. Can you excuse us, Sonya? Vika. I am sorry. Please give me one more chance. Damn, I forgot! "When I knew the truth.. I was such a fool. I kept asking myself why a woman like you could love a man like me. I thought you have been using me…" I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I should've trusted you no matter what. I do now. I'll get on my knees if you want. You don't want my pants to get dirty? And I finished the stew you made. See? I did well, didn't I? My mom told me when I was coming here. Try to look inside a person, not to be fooled by their looks. Then you'll never regret anything. I saw what was inside you when I first met you. Yes, I approached you on purpose. Since you were the only one who treated me sincerely. I fell in love with you. Don't worry about your family. I will take care of it. You knew about it? The fake parents too? Of course. We should not have any secrets between us. - We're married, Vika. - Geon-ho! Come here. - Wait. - What? Hold on, it's coming! It's coming back, Vika! - No time for this. Let's go. - What's coming? - Stamina is back? - Yes. Keep the bags, Sonya. It's from his pockets. Let us know when he wakes up. TAE-GYU &amp; JU-YEONG FOREVER NO MATTER WHAT It looks yummy! It tastes much better. I realized I haven't cooked your favorite dish for years. You realized that now? What? Is it a proposal? Not like that! Do it again. I thought I should do it before the wedding. It doesn't matter. We're getting married anyway. I'll warm up the stew. Will it be the same as the first time then? Can we be like the first time if we try hard? The wedding is making you quite sentimental, right? But we'll be different from others. We know each other well. Right, we know each other well! Let's make it work. I'll heat it up. We ask for your blessing. Amen. Dad, I'm pregnant. That's why I rushed here. But I'm having second thoughts about the wedding. You know what? I prefer dancing to playing the piano. I like clubbing as much as going to church. I drink a lot, I dated a lot, and I like racy things. I want to live as the person I really am from now on. Not as the daughter of Reverend Kang. Just as Kang I-ra. I bet it'll take less than ten minutes for this rumor to spread in the parish. I have my regrets too. I'm sorry, baby. I mean, how come that Dae-bok guy knows you better than I do? That hurts. I guess I embarrassed myself in front of the congregation. It's because you've been with only one person in your life. You're wondering if there's a better man out there. Amazing grace… You want to run away on your wedding day, don't you? I was also like you. I regret I didn't. What if I take my chances? Tonight is the last chance. Hold on. That saved a wretch… Hey, Dae-bok! What are you doing? Of the 200 hymns I memorized, only this one got stuck in my head. Amazing Grace! Unbelievable. All the same losers. How sweet the sound You only live once! Be bold! That saved a wretch like me Do whatever your heart wants! You idiot! - I-ra… - Stop crying. Shut it! You pathetic idiot. - We've been together too long. - Are you still there? OH SO-RI 125-1 GYE-DONG, JONGNO, SEOUL HOW'S THAT? - How many times did you come? - One more time. - Pull my head! - Like this? - Yes, like that! - Harder? IM STEALS 58 BASES IM RETIRES THE FIRST BATTER IM'S GRAND SLAM IM TAE-GYU Tae-gyoo, are you all right? How's your head? How can an ex-ballplayer get hit by a ball and get a concussion? You've slept a whole day. I was terrified, thought you'd never wake up. - Honey. - Are you really okay? Do you remember everything? What year is it? I was wearing a wrinkled shirt. That's why I got hit. That's an old jinx. You kept my shirts ironed because you cared about it too. Now I realize it's not about the shirts. Bad things happen when you're not around. I always got in trouble when you were not with me. What can you do without me? So let's call it a tie and resume the game. Joo-yeong, I'm such a fool. No, I am! To love you so much! Are you crazy? You fantasized about doing it in a hospital. This is your chance. Stop, it tickles! - You know what? - What? Today is our wedding day. What do we do? - No, it's tomorrow. - You slept a whole day. Then let's do it today. We cancelled everything! No famous singers whatsoever! Please match the color of her eyebrows and hair. - And put more glitter on. - Okay. Please let me know if you need anything. Will do. - Who's going to get the bouquet? - Me! About this manicure here… It will stand out too much. How about we remove it? Is it a birthmark? It's tacky. Get rid of it. - Hey. - What is it? What's wrong? Ms. Oh. - Are you okay? - Is something wrong? Ms. Kang! We'll get married today! Im Tae-gyoo and Bae Joo-yeong. We're running late. Are you done crying? You look like Rudolph right now. I kind of knew you'd hurt me sooner or later, but this really hurts. I'm sorry for hurting you. Can I hold you one last time? Thank you for coming. I'm sorry. You change your mind so often! - So you're getting married? - Yes, sir! So sorry. - Please go in. - Could you excuse us? What happened? Where's your minister? Right! I forgot to tell him the wedding is back on. He is in the U.S. now. You ruined my wedding! Why did you call it off in the first place? - Fix it! - We have less than 20 minutes. What do we do? - It's just like you to do this! - Why didn't you check? I had a concussion, remember? Everyone, quiet! From now on, I'm in charge! Do-a, see if there's a guest who can officiate a wedding. - Got it! - Could you two get... I-ra! I need to talk to you. - What are you… - I found my minister! Someone who knows us well! Well, there have been many ups and downs until these two finally walk down the aisle. She once stabbed my groin with scissors… - Cut it out! - …and nearly castrated me. Anyway, after all this, they are here to be together. Until yesterday, they were on the verge of breaking up. But I always envied them for having a history to argue over. I envied them for having memories to bring them back together. I was going to get married in two days, but it's called off now. We didn't have a long history together. It was love at first sight. I wanted to marry her only because I loved her. We were so different since we'd lived separately for 30 years. At first, it was opposites attracted to each other. I thought I could embrace all the differences. But then I realized I was wrong. Ms. Kang I-ra, the wedding planner. Ms. Kang! Please say something. Are you insane? Why is it so hard for us to get married? You want my honest answer? Getting married is quite complicated. Everyone thinks that marriage is the answer to love, family, and sex. But we all know that love and sex don't always go together. Sometimes you want sex but don't want a family. Or you're afraid you might fall out of love when you have a family. Knowing marriage can't solve any of these problems, you expect one person to be the solution to all your problems. Isn't it nonsense? Yes, it is. I know it's all nonsense. On that note, I'll finish my wedding speech with my solemn vow. - What? - What now? Hey. Cue. I swear you will be my only regret. I have thought about all the possible misfortunes that could happen in my life. And now, I decided to sacrifice my life for only one person. That's you! What now? Fantastic! I will dedicate this song to my lovely bride who's been with me for 15 years ever since I fell in love with her at first sight. He's a terrible singer though. Music, please! Here's a sad rhapsody By the king of the night Round of applause, everyone! It's 3 a. m. on the wedding day I'm so worried She's not answering the phone What is happening? Are we over? I'm lonely and scared tonight This is 100 questions and answers about me. You said you don't know much about me. BENEVOLENT PARENTS This is my family. When I was little. It was so hard making it. Read it and make one for me. I know it's a lot of work. I'd rather talk. How about tonight? In our new bed? - Tonight? Our bed? - We have our own place. - Tonight or tomorrow night? - We can talk every night? You mean it? Quick question. Since when did you and my dad became so close? Well, let's say it's a secret between us. Ms. Kang, another couple is missing! Another couple? - Yes. - Again? Wait up. - My legs… - You're here! Why are you so late? I was worried. I am sorry. We barely slept. What's with your face? - Doing it five times can be tough. - What are you talking about? Put some foundation on his face now! - My face? - Come this way! That gown belongs to her. Look at him. Kiss! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Congratulations! Father! Let's go! Stop kissing, will you? Congratulations. - I don't believe it. - I want to do it too. Are you crazy? Don't even think about it! - Hey, calm down! - What? Stop it. The earliest flight to Jeju, please! I'm afraid all flights are delayed due to the typhoon and we're not able to issue tickets today. My name is Oh So-ri. Autograph, please. I almost missed it. So you changed the ending? Upon a certain reader's request. I like sleeping in, the foam on a beer, making a cross on a mosquito bite, and a night walk with music. I also like crisp sheets. I prefer bowties over ties and calls over texts. You said you'd be busy this weekend. I somehow made time. But I don't like a group tours or tourist places. You came to the right person. I'll be your one-on-one tour guide. You might get bored soon though. There's only ocean behind the horizon. I know, but I like it for now. I like it. I love it. Hello! Chef, they are here! - Take care. - Thank you. CONGRATULATIONS! FROM A HANDSOME CHEF So-mi! Congratulations! - Look over there! - It's so beautiful! It's amazing! Honey! Hey, you're here! I can't stand it. Let's go! Quiet! - Way to go, Tae-gyoo! - Crush him, Dr. Kim! - Go for it! - Tae-gyoo! - Your ex is stronger! - What did you say? - Was I wrong? - Are you serious? Yes, I am! He is mine now! I-ra! Give it to me! We're getting married!
