Have you arrived at the location? It is in the residential area? What happened? Apparently, a robbery. Request reinforcement if necessary. We're close. She's going to turn around. It looks like it's one of the last houses. I repeat, you can use force if necessary. Over. It's there. Good evening. Is this the location? Good evening. My house is open. I think someone got in. Did you enter the house? I arrived with my brother, and when I saw the opened door, I called you and my boyfriend. I came as fast as I could. Did you see anything unusual? Just the opened door. And the lights on. Okay. Let's go. Wait here. Okay. Murderer! Is the accusation true? Is this what happened? How were you involved? How did it happen? I come from a loving family. A supportive family. They taught right from wrong. And they respected my choices. My mom took care of us. Me, my dad, and my brother Cris, while he lived with us. She was a housewife. I'm cooking you some beans! - Thanks! - Of course! My dad was a law clerk. He taught me to do the right thing, the perks of hard work, and to take care of the family. Ouch! Take it, take it. Take all of it. You fix them later. But he respected my true calling, aeromodelling. Hey! Hey! Hi, sorry to interrupt. Not at all. How can I help you? - Are you Daniel? - That's me. - And you are? - Marísia. This is my son Andreas. A big fan of aeromodelling. He's a little shy though. I believe a few classes might help. What about her? Her? - No, just my boy. - So let's do this. - Go on. - Get in here. Come on. Go. Hey. Thanks. Try to keep it steady. - Okay. - Higher. That's it. Atta boy. - Is this okay? - Great! You're a natural. - Is my mom watching? - She is. - Awesome. - Wait. Is that your sister? - Su? - Look at it, don't look at me! - Sorry, man. - No worries. Does she have a boyfriend or what? Suzane? No way. She's a nerd. I see. Let's land it now. Slowly, slowly… and… - Got it! - That's it! Nice! You nailed it! Look! He got the hang of it! - Congrats, dude. - Thanks. What is it, baby? Are you anxious about the championship? Just recapping my moves. Sure, your moves. I know you. There's more to these "moves." Who's the lucky girl? This one is different, Mom. She's a princess. And her brother is taking my classes. Can you believe that? You shouldn't mix these things, Daniel. Where's the fun in that? I invited her to the Campinas' Championship, but her mom said no. I told her my dad could drive us, but she was against it, so… Look. Give it time. Work your way around it. At the next class, talk to her. I'm sure this lucky princess' mother will see a prince in you. Okay? Okay, my queen. I'll do that. Astrogildo! Today is the day! It could be closer though. - Nice move! - Go, Daniel! Come on! Did you see that? - Good one, son! - Go, Daniel! Go, Dani! Go, Daniel! You've got this! That's my son! Cravinhos family. I told you! That's my son! He can beat anything, anytime, anywhere! That's my boy over there! Congratulations! You brought me luck. Dan! People are watching. We're doing nothing wrong. - Can I hug the champion? - Sure. Congratulations, son. I was dying to meet you. Would you like some pie or cake? Thank you, ma'am. You'll get me fat. Not a chance. You're so beautiful and skinny. You should eat more. And don't call me that. Do you call him "sir"? No, just Astro. - Yes, my Astro. - It's a habit. - Nadja. - Here's some cutlery. What about my… - Cristian! It's Cristian! - Whoa! What's up, family? I'm home! You're here! Don't, don't, don't! - Show me those boobs! - Stop it, we have guests. - That's my lady. - Hey, dad. Show some respect. - Bro! - You are late. - Get over here! - Jeez, man! Fuck. Dude, you're the man! - Cheers! - Thank you. And you must be the famous Su. - He's babbling about you for months. - You rat! What about this one? Your brother-in-law? I'm… what's that? Take a chair and sit with us. I'm not hungry, Mom. I gotta run. I have a gig tomorrow morning. - What gig? - A job, Mom. My shit. Just be careful. Why don't you stay for the night? The gig is next to my place. How can you not live here? Your parents are the best. We can switch families. I'll give you mine. What do you say? I'm in. She's being sweet. - All of this? - Yeah. It will be yours someday. Don't worry. I'll teach you all I know. So pretty. Yo! Yo, brat. Come with me. - Wanna check out my bike? - Sure. You owe me. What's that? For my favorite aeromodeller. You shouldn't have… What is it? - Holy shit. - You don't like it? It's so unexpected. I always dreamed about this watch. I know. I saw you drooling over it at the mall. It's for you. The best. Only the best. Slow down, Dani. Slow down. Stop, stop! - Get off! - Wait. What is it? What happened? Did I do something wrong? Is it your first time? You said you weren't a virgin. I'm not a virgin! You don't get it. You never will. Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The mood got… awkward. I was embarrassed. But she said she was okay. That I shouldn't bring it up again. - Yo, Dad. - What? Dan! I'm out! - Dan! - Shh. - Biro-biro is a sensitive bird. - My bad. I'm here. Cool, I'll take them home. Did someone die? No, let's talk about it later. You should go. - Take care. - Bye, Dad. Come on. - Biro-biro seems happy. - Yeah. Son, what's that? Su gave it to me. As a surprise. This will cost you later. It didn't cost her that much. Do her parents know about the two of you? They don't know-know. Su is a little… Weird, reserved… Women usually are. Weird. Stubborn. Ask your mother. She's a pro. Well, she got me. I will, Dad. - Are you ready for that? - For what? The cage? Andreas told me he wants a new model for Christmas. My parents are on it. Tell your mom to stop by my shop. I could build him one, and she could meet my folks. What do you think? I dunno. I don't wanna take the risk. What risk? I'm cool. My folks are cool… Your "folks" aren't the problem. But your mother likes me, right? I'm just being paranoid. Yeah, I can tell. Seriously? - What? - Seriously? - Are you being serious? - I'm kidding! - Are you or are you not? - I'm just kidding! So now you're kidding! Because you sound just like them! Pushy and suffocating! - I'm not being pushy, Su. - My mom is on her way. Go ahead! To your class! Fresh coffee. I just brewed. It's sweetened. - Cheers! - Cheers. Thank you. To our children. Your kids are so sweet. And so polite. I hope they are not disturbing you with all these visits. Not at all. I like it. Suzane is such a beautiful girl. I always wanted a baby girl. To play with girlish things. You know what I mean. And look at Andreas. He reminds me of Daniel. I already see him winning some championships. Yeah, it's a great hobby. Is Daniel at college? He… competes in international championships and works here at his shop. - You know what it's like. - Sure. Well, kids… - Shall we? - Already? Yeah, we should go. And here… is your first payment. Please, Mrs. Marísia. It's my Christmas gift for him. - That's very kind of you. - Not at all. When can we fly it? Next weekend. I can take it to your house myself. Maybe I can meet your dad. The German dad you always talk about. Great. And maybe you can come with your husband. You're more than welcome. What do you say? Sure. It'll be my pleasure. Right, kids? We could all eat together. You made it! I was getting worried. Sorry, the traffic was awful. That's alright. I brewed us some coffee. Great! It's so close. We should have walked. - Excuse me. - Be my guest. What a beautiful house! - Dani! - What's up, dude? Look what I brought. - Look. - It's fucking awesome! Language! Leave him. He's just happy. Let's hang it on my bedroom's wall. Can I say hi to my girlfriend first? Maybe meet my father-in-law? Is that okay? - Let's get going. - Excuse me. Suzane told me you are an artist. - I wish! - She is. I teach canvas painting classes. Sure. We have a taste for art, don't we, Manfred? Art. We love it. Every time we go to Europe, we visit all the exhibitions we can. Last year, we visited Pergamon museum in Berlin and Sammlung Schack in Munich. They're both magnificent! I can imagine. Manfred should visit Daniel's shop. Sure. Eventually. My birthday is next month. We could set up a party. Good idea. January's a busy time for me. The first month of the year. I work with the Highway Department, and with the holidays… - Sure. - It's complicated. There will be other opportunities. I understand. We will make an effort. Absolutely. Well, we should get going. Come on, Nadja. No, no, no. Wait. We should take a picture. - But… - Of the families. - A picture? - Sure. Take a seat, Dad. - Want a hand? - Sure. Stand back, Andreas. - Parents only. - Scooch over. - You can take the center. - Sure. Thank you. Scooch. There. It's okay. Smile, Dad. Your dad ain't that bad. I even think he liked me. Germans are deceiving. No, no. Don't touch that. Why not? What is it? One of your birthday gifts. Gifts? The most special one. You are the most special one. No, no! Don't close it. - Why? - Because it's prohibited. Even when my girlfriends are here. Okay. Yes, sir. Baron von Richthofen. I'll behave. I'll behave. I love you, son. Ooh! Knock it off! Open my gift! I love you too, baby girl. Let me see it. Wow! Lucky bastard! Show it to me! You look great! Already? I'm fast. And sexy. Really? I knew it would look good on you. Thank you. Come here. - What did you wish for? - When? When you blew out the candles. What did you wish for? Shouldn't say it out loud. Otherwise, it won't work. What's that? To chill out. And do whatever you feel like. Do we need that to chill out? It's not so fun to do it alone. You athlete. Here. I promise not to behave. Relax. This happened at the beginning of your relationship, am I right? Get in. During these trips, who paid the bill? I wouldn't let her pay. She insisted on it, but I didn't want her to. I always worked. Always struggled for my money. Got my independence very early. You're hilarious! I'm hungry! - Almost, Mr. Manfred. - How long? Here, Dad. It's done. - Tell me. How many errors? - Just a few. - No errors! - Hey! Manfred! - It's Sunday. - I don't care. Rules are rules! You must study. Hard. So you can buy yourself a house like this. So you can have comfort. And relax. If you don't study, you'll live in a shithole. And live off gigs as a handyman. Is that what you want for yourself? Barbecue guy, I'm hungry! Good one! There you are. Suzane. Suzane! When is he leaving? - I'll get you more ice cream. - I'm fine. I'll get it. - No more ice cream! - You wanna control what we eat now? - Enough! - You're wasted. What a nasty reputation? - Shut up. - She's the boss now. You're done. Shut your hole! Fuck you! Watch your mouth, motherfucker. - I'll hit you in front of him. - Do it, big man! You're an asshole! Fuck all of you! - What the hell? - Son of a bitch! I wish you were dead! Both of you! Dead! I was in shock. I never thought they could behave like that. I knew them for three months. But I never saw anything of the sort before. And things just got worse. Suzane told me she had a problem. They hit her because of their drinking habits. She was a troubled girl. Hi, Su. I can't stand another minutewithout you. Come over. You know how. Okay, cool. I'm on my way. Suzane's mom didn't like us meeting or traveling a lot. She claimed it would damageSu's studies. Hooking up during the weekwas impossible. That's when Su suggested hooking up secretly. Without her parent's knowledge. Get in! Quick! - Dani? - Close the door! My dad is drunk sleeping. - And your mom? - At the theater with a friend. - We could go to RedPlay. - You're not invited. Why not? Let's take him. He can play with my brother. Yeah, okay. We'll leave when Mom gets back. - Now go to your room. - Okay. Hurry! Hi, Mom. - Up this late? - I'm finishing this reading. - Okay. Good night. - Bye. Come, come. - Boo! - Fuck, Andreas! - Let's play. - Wait. - What? - Take this. Come. - Wait. - Hurry up. Let's go. Yeehaw! - What's up? - Dingle! We used to leave Andreas at RedPlay with my brother. We'll pick you up later, okay? - Let's go, brat! - Yeah! Then we would go to a motel with Suzane's fake ID. - Yo! - Hey, man! - What's up? - Cool? - Hey there, punk! - What's up, dude? I'm out. Su. Can I ask you something? - There you go again. - Why so defensive? Can I or what? Can I not answer it? During sex, why don't you like when we... No! What a stupid question! It's not stupid. People do it, and you don't. Because I don't like it, okay? It feels weird. Is that a problem? It's not a problem, but we should talk about it. Great. Awesome. You ruined it! Are you happy now? Shit! Fuck. Time to go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ruin it. Do you know what I want? That we could hit the road, just the two of us. Not freaking out about the time. They would never allow it. Sometimes I think it would be a lot easier if they disappeared. - Are you nuts? - Just imagine. We would be free. No rules, no curfews, no cages, no pressure. It's not a crime to imagine it, right? They don't need to know. Never. They don't need to know. Never. Never. - Hey, Su. - I'm fucked. I'm fucked. What happened? Talk to me. Come over. I need you right now! - Hurry, Daniel! - Calm down. - Fucking come, Daniel! - Meet me outside. - Hey, what's going on? - Keep quiet, or they'll wake up. My mom showed up at karate. She found out. - Damn it. - She took me out of the class. I can't see you during the week. She can't do that. They are always lurking, stalking me and my cellphone. - They're everywhere! - Listen to me. We'll figure this out. There's always a solution. I'll have to go to the beach this weekend with my mom. - What? - She made me. But what… What about me? There's only one way. You could go. In secret. Hey, Dani. Nice to see you here. What's up, guys? You took long enough. My mom asked us to hang out with her and Flora. We couldn't say no. - Who's Flora? - An old patient of hers. They are friends now. Which is good. Now she has some company. Dad is always busy. - I'll have a swim. - Okay. Mom and Flora are like hand and glove. - Always together. - What's this? On your arm? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? Not a big deal. Are you sure? My dad grabbed me when he found out about the karate. He was angry, that's all. And your mom also thinks that's okay? I have sensitive skin. You all can't possibly think this is okay. Light it up. It's too windy. And you are too stressed out. Panda bear! An ugly fucking one. - Did you like the inn? - Yeah. I mean, the shower wasn't working this morning... - That's all I could pay for. - It's great. Don't worry. Dan. Dan. Run, it's my mom! Run, run! Aha. What are you up to? Just playing around. And you? Just shopping around. I'd rather go back. - I wanna open the wine we bought. - Wine's good. It's hot. Okay. - Don't take long. - Okay. - Good luck! - Bye. Dan, come. That was awkward. It's okay. Dan, Dan! It's my dad! Run! - What? - Go! - Are you sure? - Follow him! - Calm down. - Go! It's my dad! - Go, go! - Wait. Fuck, Dan! Fuck! You did that on purpose. - What? Are you nuts? - You did! Why would your dad be in a motel? Fucking embarrassing. Calm down. We don't know if it was him. Stop being so naive. He bad-mouths you all the time. Why are you defending him? I know. I know he fucks whores after work. I saw it on his computer once. Did you tell your mom? She probably knows. It's her hall pass. So she can fuck her friend too. She thinks no one knows. Shitty family. Look, I can't confirm it, but she told me that Marísia had a fling with another woman, that she was bisexual. Silence, please. And that Manfred had a lover. Suzane knew it. But I can't say for sure if it really happened. That's how she presented me with the facts. Seeing you only on weekends sucks. What should I do? "Rules are rules. Period." Let's talk to them. We can't keep this hiding thing. I'm not hiding you from them. I'm hiding them from you. But it's useless. They keep bad-mouthing you. Criticizing you. What do they say about me? I'm a regular guy. I know, and that's why. They want me to find a Prince Charming. They say that you are poor, uneducated, and hopeless. They tell me not to get involved because you're not the one for me. "He's no good for you," they keep telling me. If I don't study, I'll become ignorant like you. Dani, I don't know what happened. Don't worry. I've been there a thousand times. - But the wing is broken. - It's okay. I can fix it. Chill, take a seat. Chill. Hey. Come here. It's okay. What… - I didn't know you were coming. - I meant to surprise Andreas. - Dani! - Here. Brand-new. Thanks. Is Su home? She just got home from school, and she needs to study. - She'll have lunch in her room. - You could join us. Right? It's delicious, Mrs. Marísia. Say that to Dete. I don't cook. Don't mind her. We are not in our best mood. Dan? Why didn't you call me? Because it's a school day. For those who study. Exactly, Mr. Manfred. I'm here for work. Actually, I've been working a lot lately. Good for you. Are you back to school? I've been thinking about it, but I'm out of time. Don't worry. You'll have plenty next month. - What do you mean? - Suzane didn't tell you? She won't be around to stand in your way. I was meaning to tell you. We're going to Europe. An entire month? Time flies, Dan. - My hands are tied. - They did that on purpose. - I promise you… - Don't make more promises! This is unbelievable! - I feel like a fool. - Honey. You are the best. Can I at least take you to the airport? You better not. - Wait for me. - That trip was hard on me. Her parents knew exactly how to hurt her. Through me. It's ready. Great. There you go. Thank you. Hey, Su. Su? Hello? Hello? Hello Su? Su! Su… Hey, Dan. - Mom said... - Cris. Don't. Please. Bro! You can't continue with this sitting and crying bullshit. Come on. Suit up. Let's party. Sorry, man. I'm not in the mood. Dude. Have you lost it? Come with me. Don't do that. Look. Your dingle! Okay. Come on. That's my boy! I've missed you! I've missed you more. And to top it off… Wait. Come over here. I wanna hear it. How was it? Jeez, Su. Again? Tell me. How was it? Awful. It was awful. Every place I saw reminded me of you. Made me wonder what you would think of it. The things we could do. I wish I had stayed here with you. Without them. I wonder how your dad reacted seeing you buy all this for me. He doesn't know. He's so worried about the SATs. More than me, actually. He enrolled me in a preparatory course. Wait. What? - So I won't see you at all? - Dan! What can I do? Let him do it. What choice do I have? No, we should talk. I'll talk to him. Listen up, hun. I like your daughter. Why are you against it? What's the matter? - He'll back away. I'm sure of it. - I'll tell him. Who do you think you are to stop me from liking her? I like her. I love her. Is it because I'm poor? Then watch this poor fella in action. Here. Pow, pow, pow. Is he dead? She kept telling me she planned to kill her parents. But I couldn't see why. I thought she didn't mean it. Every kid has parent issues. Mom is breathing down my neck, man. Following me around. I'm not a baby. I earn my own money. And she keeps treating me like… Jeez. You could talk to her, you know? She might hear you. Dan! Earth to Dan! You're too young to be hurting like that. I'm tired, Cris. Manfred wants her to go to São Francisco's College. And she's terrified of him. So, I hope she doesn't in order to make him mad. Word. Dan, get that into your skull. Nothing lasts forever. Good or bad shit, you know? Listen. If they get in your way, call me. You know I'm here for you. Right? Right, brat? Right? Answer me. Where's your dingle? Three, two, one! No way. No more cabs. If you were at São Francisco, the car would be better. But I wanted a Gol. - I want a ride. - Come, Andreas! Maybe if you had studied more… What for? Maybe for air conditioning. - I can install it later. - Can you? Really? - Thank you, son. - Sure, Mom. - You're a sweetie. - Hi! - Hey, babe. - Hi. Are you in from college? - But I signed the presence list. - Are you cutting class? Mom… How long do we have? Until 7:15. Where do you wanna go? Come on. We have enough time. - You two! - We'll be back, Mom. Careful. Did you forget to hide the car? It's an in-and-out. What is it, Su? Fuck! This jingle always makes me nervous. - Let's listen. - …and 27 vehicles were involved. Twelve people died. The accident took place… …the western highway… What happened? - Tell me! - My dad! - What did that prick do to you? - What is it, sweetie? I can't take it anymore, Nadja. I can't. I ran away. I want to live here. It was awful. He said terrible things. Ignore him, Su. He prohibited me from dating you. What is it? What? Did he beat you? I have it all planned. We can use his gun. Or we can burn down the ranch with them inside. What are you talking about? We can blame the maid. We are not killers. You must save me from him. You can't be serious. Don't say that. Let's talk. I was only a toddler the first time it happened. I dunno. I couldn't see the cruelty of it. What are you talking about? When my dad drinks, he enters my room and forces me to… Forces you to do what? - He… - Tell me, Su! He forces me to… Do you understand now? That's what she told me. Whenever her mother grounded her, her father would get drunk, go to her room, and hit her. He used it as an excuse to… touch her private parts. I didn't know how to deal with it. Or with myself. Wait. Su! Hold on! Su! That's joint number six. You're wasted... Fuck it! Leave me alone! Out. Su. I think I owe you an apology. I should have noticed the first time we slept... Dan! Stop! Stop it! I don't wanna talk about it. I don't. I talked to them. I told them we split up. And they gave me a break. They are off to Europe for a month. A month without them? You could move in. I feel embarrassed after what happened… Stop. Stop talking. It's okay. Everything is fine. Save it. Save it. Do you promise to never, never leave me alone? What do you mean? I'll give my life for you if I have to. Let's make a pact. For life. Would you do that for me? I'm already doing it. I promise. I promise. She told me how she planned to kill her father. She would use his own gun. A gun I didn't know of. She asked me to test the gun inside his room. Doors and windows closed. She would stay outsideduring the shot to see how loud it would be. They had soundproofing windows, so it shouldn't be too loud. Her plan was to wait for them to sleep, enter their room, and kill them with his gun. I got involved. I was drawn into it. I believed her, and I did what she asked me to. Imagine if their airplane crashed. Things would be much easier. We could stay here in paradise. Think about it. Think about my plan. When I agreed to it, I hadn't realized she was using me. But she did use me. Me and my brother. She said it would be faster if Cris were there. Help me. You're like a brother to me. - Let go of me. - Please, Cristian. - Let go! - You're the only one that can help us. - It will be easier with you. - You're both crazy. Crazy. Crazy. Alright? I'll do it anyway. I need to protect her. No, bro. I won't do it. Look at me! Look at me! I should beat you up! Are you both crazy? Fuck! Cris, I've always been there for you! I was here when you needed me! Now I need you! This is completely different! Are you nuts? Cris. Please, help me. - Su, you are... - Listen. I'll give you a few days to think about it. Dan. - Dan. - Let's go, Su. I am your brother. Not if you bail. Let's go. No… - Please! - Let's go! Hey. You can't look like that. Just pretend nothing is happening. Act naturally. I was completely lost. I was trying to wrap my head around it. My mom was at the library reading or whatever. So I couldn't get the shovels from the fireplace. Maybe if you cut those, it will do. She told me she would distract my parents with a computer thing. That way, I could go to her carunnoticed. Andreas texted me to let me know his parentswere sleeping. So I went to pick him up. It's going to happen with or without you! I just need your help! I've always been fucking there for you, Cris! Don't give up. - I'm on my way. - Daniel. - I'm here for you. - Don't give up. - Come on, then. - Calm down. Andreas! Lead the way. We're heading to the motel. We should be back at 3:00 a.m. I'll let you know, okay? Go play. Go. Go play. Go play. Dude, don't do this. Don't do this… - Cris, help me. - Wait, wait! Please. I can't live like this anymore. - Please, Cris. - Dude, don't. I didn't give him much choice. - He had to go along. - Calm down. - Come on. - Who drove there? Who was in charge? She was. My hands were shaking so bad, I couldn't do it. When we get there, I will enter first, right? I'll make sure they are sleeping and give you the signal. - No, no. - It will work. - Okay. - He won't do it. - I will do it. - Let's stop the car. - Let's turn around. - You go. You turn around. When I realized we were already there. - Knock it off, bro. - We're here. Duck. It's showtime. Showtime. - Dude, knock it off. - Shut up, Cris. Just stop. Dude. Quiet you two. Here are the socks and the gloves. I'll check if they are asleep. I'll be back. Fuck, man! Come on. They are sleeping. Come on. Fuck! I told you to be quiet, damn it! Cover her mouth! Go on! I know she tells a different story. I know she says terrible things about me. About my family. I don't how I got manipulated by her. Is it over? My name is Suzane Louise von Richthofen. I want to tell my story. My life. Back then… I thought he wanted to kill my parents out of love. But now I know that it was for money.
