Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad What is this? This is the pickle? I didn't use any sugar. Really? I didn't need the sugar because of the natural sweetness of the fruits. And it'll help with the digestion... Are you crazy? Do you know much this costs? The cost of the pickles for the day equals your monthly salary! How did you think this was possible? Huh?! Chef. You? are in charge, aren't you? Eggs, that's your responsibility? Don't you have anything to say to me? There's nothing you want to tell me? Right, Chef. I received it. I received 10,000,000 won. From where? Who did you take 10,000,000 won from? Just answer me. The 10,000,000 from a Hyung Jae Vendor, you really took it? Yes. But I'm innocent. Don't you know me? You don't know me? Please believe me, Chef. How dare she? She accepted 10,000,000 from a Hyung Jae? It's not President Seol but Seo Yoo Kyung who took the money? That's what she said, right? How can she take that 10,000,000? Chef! Chef! I have something to show you. Here. Get in. What? I said, get in. How did he find out about that money she took? Wasn't she an innocent creature? When did she take that money? You can't trust anybody. And what was that about hugging her like this? He seemed like Dracula to me. To suck out the blood, he just grabbed the neck?! Stop it. Where did you go with the Chef earlier today? Where are they going? They're probably in the same place. Where are we going? To hell, why? Get out. If I can pull out my guts to show you, I would. I can never do such a gutsy thing. Here. What is this? Balance 36,500 won. Not that, but that at the top. Oh I see, so you're telling me you're so poor that you had no choice but to accept it? This right here. This one up at the top. I have no interest in how much money you have. Get out. Oh man? Get out. By your effort, do you mean her? Look at this. You see it, don't you? As soon as the money was deposited, I took it out. The same day this was deposited, I withdrew it and gave it to Chef Totti. Did you get it back? Why do I have to be doubted like this? And Chef Totti wouldn't have taken that money and ran off to Italy. Isn't it possible he got the money back and acting like he didn't? - Oh goodness. - Did you see it? Did you see me getting the money back? Aren't you just putting it on Chef Totti since he's gone? Aren't you the one that's acting? It's so great to see you two fighting like that. Really great. Keep going. I said keep going. The person who gave the money and the person who received it, grab each other's collars, pull each other's hair out. Okay? Make it a real match. I'll stay out of it. I gave it back. Just look at this. But, this is Jumbo at 70 grams. This one is Regular at 55 grams. Changing out 700 flats of eggs, you know how unethical that is, don't you? Don't do it! You two smell like chicken shit. An awful stench. - I tried to be patient but... - Chef! Can't you just trust me? You said you won't make any pickles but you did, behind my back, then put it in the dining room. That's you. That's who you are. That was because President Seol knew about the money and kept threatening to fire me so I had no choice. I really wasn't trying to betray you. I really wasn't. President Seol knew about it? Wait a second. If you didn't say anything to President Seol, he knew all about it and threatened you with it? Yes. I never mentioned the money to President Seol. Then how did he know about me receiving the money? I thought you told him about it. - No, I didn't. - I didn't either. So then?? Here it is. I'm going crazy! And uh? Oh, the real estate agent dropped off this rental contract earlier. With Sae Young moving here and all, should I just live here, too? Aren't you going back home? Hey, you don't have anyone here to nag at you so you do whatever you want with no thought to getting married, that's why. [ Seol Jun Seok Sunbae] They keep dropping? the daily sales. It should go up with the year end and the new year. You received a report daily? Uh huh. I'll leave. You two sleep together tonight. Really. Unni! Why? You haven't slept together yet? You kill me. President, uh? What? I have the comparison chart you asked for. Wow, you can even do graphs? Oh, I can't stand this! With these sales, how can I not obsess over money, money, money? Chef, what are you going to do with me? Are you going to fire me again? Hey! You're still a suspect, for taking a bribery. A third of the suspicion is on you, a third is on Kwang Tae, and a third on President Seol. You know? You can still say that even after looking at my gut? Oh hey, Miss Seo! Hello! Aren't you hungry? Come have some of this. - Do you want? - I'm going home. Why are you back? My car isn't there. So why did you park it just anywhere? They always tow cars away from that spot. I wanted to say something to you about it. You should have told me! Oh man! Every time I started to say something earlier, you wouldn't have any of it. If I told you squids have 10 arms and tentacles, would you believe me? If I said the fork is sharper than a spoon, would you believe it? You don't believe anything I say. Are you looking for a taxi? Go over that way. There are a lot of taxis over there. I don't have any money either. My bag was in the car. Give me some money for the taxi. I don't have any. Then how were you going to get home, huh? - How? How? How? - I was going to get a ride from them. Ahjussi said he'll take me home after they close. - I know you have money. - What money? Your entire fortune. Oh, that 36,500 won? My gut? Isn't it more like 10,036,500 won? If you don't want to be doubted, then why don't you just hand that 10,000,000 won over. If I really did take that money, I'll pull out my guts and my gall bladder and hand them to you. Hey, I don't like women who don't have guts or gall bladders. Aigoo, my goodness. Sit down or walk home, do as you like. All I know is I have to eat this. Oh, that's hot! All this torture is because of you. Then why don't you make me believe you?! Can't you just believe in me? You won't regret it. For what reason would I trust you? Just believe because you believe. If there are reasons and alibis, nothing to doubt, how is that ?just' believing? How does that make you any different than a stranger on the street? So you did good? Huh? Are you shouting at me because you did good? This is getting bloated. Let's eat. Oh, it's because I was so cold. Do you have any kimchi? You even want kimchi from them? We have some. Of course we have it. We're out of it. We have something even better. Miss Seo always bought cucumbers from us, so I made her Ramen a few times. And last month, she brought us some of this. She said she made it with leftover cucumbers. My husband is Diabetic so she made it without any sugar. She never forgets anything, even if she heard it just once. Isn't she something? Try some. Yes, it's very good. With Ramen, it's better than kimchi. It's refreshing and delicious. Really. The Chef doesn't like pickles, ahjumma. Why not? He must be tired of it. Just let him be. I don't want it. Hey, Young Joon's mom! Why are you leaving? Let me get that for you. I didn't put any sugar in it. How can it be this good? Ahjumma, did you do anything to this? Isn't it good? Just eat. Hey you! They said you've been a regular customer for 3 years so they'd give you the money for a taxi and you refused it? Huh?! I don't even accept a thousand won from anyone. Oh it's too cold! I'll walk her out and be right back. You don't have to come back. Good night, unni. I'm not opening the door for you. She's becoming more and more like mom. - Were you offended? - No. I think she's cute. What's so cute about her? Let's go. You pay more attention that I thought. To what? Oh, I see. Of course, I care about money. It's my money that went into it, down to the last plate. And you act like you don't care about it. The average daily sales is 20,000,000. Monthly is 600,000,000. The yearly average needs to be 8,000,000,000 with December, January, and February sales averaging 30,000,000, monthly 900,000,000. But look at this, today's sale isn't even half of that. When you talk numbers, you seem like a different person. Really? Yeah. So you scare me. Please get on. Hey, you could have sat in the front. Next time, ride in the cab. You're going to ride that again? Then why don't you buy a compact car with that 10,000,000 won? Oh, I'm so cold. Are you sick? Doesn't he know what time it is? He's working her to death. Why do you want to live here? Because of something when you were younger? Does the tenant have to share that with the landlord to be able to move in? He's someone you know, isn't he? Here. The rental agreement. There's a condition attached. What is it? You have to live together, with one of our employees. I don't want to. Then I don't want to either. Rest. Don't come to work tomorrow. Am I fired again? Do you think all I do is fire people? Yes. You? just rest up. - Did you get fired? - Yes, I got fired. How does he always know? I didn't. Why do you always ask if I got fired? [Leave home. I don't have a place to go] Hey, Yoo Shik. Yoo Shik. Go see your sister. Dad, I finished my exams only yesterday. Wow, you're looking prettier lately. Me? Oh not you, noona. Sous Chef, Yoo Kyung is here. - Seo Yoo Kyung. - Yes. When you left here with the Chef yesterday, what did you do? As a basic rule, the hands of a person who cooks food for people should be clean. I have a friend who works at a bank who says when he finishes the day at work, his hands stink like something is rotten. Because he's been touching money all day. That's the smell of money. Really? Let me see. Give me your hand. Give it to me. I can smell it. I can smell it, the smell of money. The Italian Consul General will be here for dinner tonight. We don't know what special requests he will make. Everybody stay on their toes and pay close attention. Understand? Yes, Chef. Does Seo Yoo Kyung have the right to hold a pan? Why are you looking at me? Does Seo Yoo Kyung have the right to hold a pan? Why are you asking me that? Besides, she's not the only one whose rights are in question here. Here. If you have eyes, take a look. This is a comparison chart of sales from last year and this year. This shows what's been happening. At this rate, in another month or two, we'll all be out on the street. During the year end/new year season, the sales always soared. So this year, why is it sliding down endlessly?! Look at the gap between the 2 lines. That's all money! Money! It's money! Are we going to miss out on the graduation and new term celebrations as well? The students that come here with their parents, without pickles?! Oh, really. Starting tomorrow... just like the exam scores are posted on the bulletin boards, I'll be posting the sales of each menu item, and grade the individuals who is responsible for those items. Grade reports? Grade reports? Shore yourselves up. Then what about me? As the kitchen assistant, how will I be graded? You will be graded by all the cooks in the kitchen. We just need to take care of 1 or 2 of them. Then you'll be the Chef. I promise you. I can deal with him being full of himself because he trained in Italy but I cannot accept him ruining our workplace. And on top of that, letting Seo Yoo Kyung off with something like that? I will not tolerate it. Of course, of course. - Please put that right over there. - Okay. That over here. Sae Young is moving today. Why aren't you helping her? I'm okay here by myself. She told me not to come. Hey, when a woman says don't come, do you think she really means it? You must believe the woman means no when she says no. That won't do. Let's have lunch at your restaurant tomorrow. Hello. I worked at Mama Mia Hotel until fairly recently. Oh yes, Chef. I have a favor to ask. There's a chef that worked in Korea and returned to Italy not too long ago. I need to get in touch with Chef Alfredo Totti. Yes. Please. Unni, may I see the customer cards? Can we trust her with it? Unni! You really didn't keep that money? What are you going to do with Seo Yoo Kyung? Shouldn't you fire her? I don't know about anything else, but a cook that receives bribery doesn't have the right to be a cook. Isn't that something you despise the most? Right. You're not being yourself. Because you're leaving her alone, President Seol is using it to push you into the corner even more. Just get back to work. That's not your spot. I'm sorry? Oh, right. No matter what the Consul General orders, make sure we have all the ingredients and sauces to fill the order. Chef, I know what he's going to order. I think he's going to order Vongole. How would you know that? I just do. Just do? I'm pretty sure... Pretty sure, my ass. What do you mean pretty sure? Are you a seer or something to take orders and accept money for it? He is picky every time he comes. But he's never ordered the same pasta twice. We have 30 types of pasta and there's only 1 that he hasn't ordered yet. Vongole. So that's why you're pretty sure? So that's why you're pretty sure it's going to be Vongole? Come here. Never ordering anything twice and always trying something new can be his style, couldn't it? I double checked the customer profile card and it listed every item he's tried so far, it really did. What if he is allergic to clams and that was the reason he never ordered the Vongole? Huh? Even when he ordered the seafood pastas, he never asked us to leave out the clams. The possibility really is big, of him ordering Vongole. Don't play the 30 to 1 odds and get all the ingredients ready. Got it? Yes, Chef. Since they use these short-necked clams in Italy, so we'll use them tonight, too. Short-necked clams taste better. Welcome to La Sfera, - Welcome. - Welcome. We put ourselves in your hands tonight, Chef. Don't worry about the bread. - Sang Shik! - Yes. - Are you ready with the appetizers? - Yes, Sous Chef. The order said they don't want bread. Oh, right. So think about what they ordered and act accordingly. Until when will you only do what you're told, huh? If you keep this up, you'll be fired. You, fired. Does he think he's the Chef or something? - Makneh, need plates set up. - I'm coming. The Consul General's party of six just arrived. I'll have the Pasta Pescadora. Yes, one Pescadora. And what pasta would you like, Consul General? May I help you? No, I'm okay. What kind of pasta shall I have tonight? Ah, would it be all right for me to order a bit later? Of course. Certainly. Please enjoy your time here. Salad with octopus and olive dressing. Sandanian Proscuitto wrapped melon. Ravioli in cream. King crab chowder. Mini spinach Lasagna Sirloin Steak Au Jus Chicken B?chamel, Sea Bass Lamb chops in reduced Port sauce. One of each. The Consul will order his pasta a little later. Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef. Makneh, you'd better keep you eye on the pasta water. Add more water right now. Yes, Chef. The order from the Consul General we've been waiting for? Seo Yoo Kyung. Yes? Vongole. I'll do it. Seo Yoo Kyung, start the Vongole. I'll do it. Seo Yoo Kyung, you do it. Yes, Chef. Get back to work. Here, use this. But that's yours, Chef. There wasn't enough time for the clam broth to develop enough flavor. This wine will enhance the flavor of the broth. - Yes, Chef. - Here. You're getting better and better at Korean every day. Is that so? The food here tasted like food from my home. It was just my taste and very delicious. Could it be because of the new Chef? Oh and, I'd like to compliment the Chef. Would you call him and the person who made this dish? Yes. Of course I call them out. Yes. One moment, please. The other restaurant uses a different type of clams so what made you decide to use the short-necked clams? That was because? of the customer profile? It's great to hear it was to your taste. The clams were great in a small amount of sauce. You're not going to scold them later for the amount of the sauce, are you? Of course not. Certainly not. I was just joking. I happened to have just received some wine from Italy. This is a token of my appreciation. Please try it. Thank you very much. You didn't need to do this. We're always indebted to you. Would it be all right to take a picture with the Chef and everyone? Oh, of course. My apologies. Smile, Chef. Okay, I'm going to take the picture. One - two - three! Makheh! Bring more of this. I heard the sales are dropping. Just worry about yourself. Keep out of our business. You were the best, always. Can you say that even after seeing this wine? Huh? Are you awake? Here. Wow. Wow. Jujubes and even Ginseng. Where did you find Ginseng here? Eat it all up and get your strength back. You're thinking about using Ginseng? Uh huh. The bitterness might make it difficult to pull off. I'll have to put my faith in this. - I see you're using Ginseng. - Yes. Barolo. Interesting. The bitter taste of the Korean Ginseng is not very pleasant. It appears you didn't use the wine properly. Your dish is absolute perfection. Excellent! It's wonderful, really. Congratulations, Miss Oh Sae Young! Thank you. It was just a momentary mistake, one I'm embarrassed about. It was a mistake. A mistake? No, it was an intentional act on your part. An intentional act to step on me, not a mistake. Was loving me a mistake to you as well? I really want to go to Rome. No matter how hard I try, I always come in second. This one time? just one time? let me have a chance, Hyun Wook. Everyone attend the group dinner tonight. It's an order. How can he order us to have dinner with him? Oh, shoot. I was supposed to meet my girlfriend. What's up with him? Here. This was a gift to the kitchen. We're going to drink it all up together, okay? Sous Chef, have another glass. I'll stop here. Really? Then, Jung Ho Nam! I prefer soju. Soju is good. Then should we have soju for our 2nd act? We're having a 2nd act? Hey, Wang Tah*. {\a6}(*nickname for one shunned by everyone) Wang Tah! - I'm sorry? - Come here. Me? Why? Just come here. You need to have a glass of this. You were the star tonight. I have meat on in the kitchen. I'm busy so? What do you have to be busy about? The meat is burning. Sit down. Hey, Makneh! Cooking the meat is something you should do by yourself. You're the Makneh. Uh, yes. I told you to sit. All focus. Not because it's what you want but, if it's the right thing to do, Seo Yoo Kyung will be fired. Don't worry. I'm sure you're anxious and nervous about all the changes taking place currently. Starting with the sauce, the Foie Gras, to nixing the pickles. And even changing around the staff in the kitchen. But all that was for the customers and for this restaurant. What will you do about the sales that are nose-diving. At the rate we're going, we'll all have to put our pans down and lose our jobs. Isn't the person you trust the least is not Seo Yoo Kyung but me? I can accept that you include Seo Yoo Kyung in your distrust of me. But let's not doubt our customers. What's really good will be noted by the customers. Can't we try and have faith in our customers? Hmmm? If in my kitchen, I am also wrong and am embarrassing to you, I will also? fire myself. I promise you. Okay? What's wrong? Nothing. If they haven't called you back from the interview by yesterday, you need to accept that you didn't make it. - I'm nervous. - About what? He doesn't take my calls lately and when I text him, he doesn't text me back. - When did that start? - Right after I got fired. All along. Why are you just now telling us? Who made it possible for him to stay there? Unni, do you think I was fired by Ho Nam, too? The person who fired you for a little kitchen romance is an ass as well as the one you saved and now is betraying you. He's the type that gets more attractive as you know him better. I'm sure the servers aren't leaving him alone. What should I do? I'm sure they'd leave him alone. What should I do? What do you want to do? Would it be okay to make him come to his senses? None of them wants to go have a second act with the Chef. Why don't you go home now, Chef? It's all because of me and I'm sorry, Chef. I'll take you home. How is that you're taking me home? It's me that's taking you home. 3x6 being 18 and 6x6 being 18? is all the same. You just cussed at me, didn't you?* {\a6}(*18 in Korean pronounced same as a profanity) Multiplication table. 6x4 is 24. You always have to have the last word. Chef. What?! Would you take me home? Go. Get lost. So let's just go home together. I'm not going! I'm not going home. I'm going to drink more. - I'm really going now! - Go! Go. Hey! Huh? You're home? Weren't you supposed to move in tomorrow? I just moved in a day early. Is that okay with you? Of course. I'll be leaving early tomorrow anyway. The landlord here said one of the rooms was yours. What? I'm renting here also. Who's the landlord? I heard from the real estate agent. I was able to get reduced rent because of it. Let's do our best to get along. I'm sure the unnies withdrew all the deposit. I'll be grateful to be able to stay on. Aigoo. We run into each other quite often. Oh, yes. Are you going to work? As an employed person, I don't have work to go to. Whether I work my employees to death or not, aren't you being overly nosey as a customer? Is it just an interest? Is it wrong for me to take interest? If you're going to frequent to such a nice restaurant, shouldn't you mind your manners, as a customer? Knowing we don't deliver, you request delivery. Knowing we're taking a break but you come during that time and order. You call out the Makneh to ask what the chefs do well and put her on the spot. Sending untouched plates back to the kitchen. Am I right? You can't force the customers to clean their plates. You treat the customers like dogs to eat whatever is given them, so why can't you train your customers like dogs to clean their plates? That's the Chef's responsibility and measure of his ability. If the dining room obviously, but if even the kitchen is chaotic, 97% of the fault lies with you and 3% lies with other people. Why do you take such keen interest in my kitchen, my restaurant? Do you own it or something? The customer is King. As for the deposit, he returned all but your portion to the unnies. - The landlord did? - Yes. Would it be possible for me to meet the landlord? It's almost impossible for even me to meet with him. He travels overseas quite frequently. Oh Sae Young paid only the unnies' portions of the deposit to move in. The grade reports will start today. - He's really going through with it? - Yeah. I don't think President Seol will leave you alone. Have you not been able to get in contact with Chef Totti yet? No. He definitely got on the plane from here, destined for Italy. Yes, please. I'll be waiting. Tell everyone to come to the 2nd floor! Yes. The staff is cleaning up the kitchen and the dining room is almost finished. I'll have everyone's head today. Customer, we're near closing for our break. Will that be all right with you? - Please take us to our table. - Yes, this way please. I'm nervous. I'll have the Pasta Al Pesto. I'll have the Tortelloni. Are you on your way to get beheaded? You, when I give the signal, call this number. Who is it to? Here. When I give you the signal, call the number. Who is it? You'll know when you call. Keep your eyes on me. Watch me. Got it? The person I gave money to was Seo Yoo Kyung. I'll show mercy. In front of everyone, I'll settle this once and for all with the person I gave money to. All right. I don't need to explain this further. [La Sfera Restaurant Sales Figures] [Sales to Date] [Sales per cook] While the Sous Chef alone was increasing sales like this, do you know how the others were doing? The blue bars represent the cooks' performance and the orange line represents the customer complaints. The complaints of the customers! Complaints! Returned plates! So why am I number one for the orange line? Pickle! You?re in charge of the pickles. [Mi Hee] [Ignore call] You think that's all? He's in charge of this menu item. That's why I ordered it. This is good. I'd like to compliment the person who prepared this. This isn't a good time? Really? We came here during the lull on purpose. Then I guess I'll have to go to the kitchen myself. Do you think it'll be okay? Where's Jung Ho Nam? So you won't answer your phone, huh? You're avoiding her, huh? You face your death today. Oh my goodness! Tell Seo Yoo Kyung to come out here. If she took the money, she should've just let it go. Everybody else is keeping mum. Why is this the only place that's raising a stink? Why does she take the money then refuse my eggs? Huh? She's dead. Today's the day of Seo Yoo Kyung's death. Where is that Seo Yoo Kyung! What's this? Her father is alive and kicking and who are you to say this is the day of my daughter's death? She'll do without before taking 10 won from someone she didn't deserve it from. That's my daughter. Who are you to say you'll take or save my daughter's life? You son of a bitch! You worthless piece of crap! We hired people, at a higher salary because they trained in Italy. They wanted superior ingredients so we bought all the expensive ingredients. It looks like the money going out is going to be more than the money coming in. Do you think I'm doing this for me to do well for myself only? I'm the person who thinks of myself last. I never think about myself first. I worry about not being able to make your payroll and that keeps me awake at nights. On top of that, acting pure and innocent, people are taking bribes from the vendors. What will you do about that? As the person responsible for the kitchen, how much longer will you keep your head in the sand? Keep your eyes on me. Watch me. Got it? President. President. What do you want? About that 10,000,000 won that Seo Yoo Kyung is to have taken, that 10,000,000 won? huh? Just answer your phone instead of letting it ring like that. Would that be all right with you? Yes, Ah! Chef Totti? It's nice to hear from you. I've been waiting for your call. Oh, yes. Oh, I understand. President Seol? Okay. One moment, please. What is Totti saying? Chef Totti wants to speak with President Seol. Here, take this. Don't you know we're in the middle of a meeting? Hurry up and hang up! Then I will pass it on. I? Without any doubt? As I was leaving? I gave to President Seol? Okay! I received it! From Totti, 10,000,000 won! - He took the money from Brothers Vending? - I was going to r... r... return it. I just held on to it for a bit. He's worse than a rat! Those thieving cats?! Should be exterminated from the kitchen? ...is what he said. Thank you. We'll be in touch again. You put the blame on someone else and now you say you were going to return it? You think we'd buy that? Uh? I just? that is? for our restaurant? I'm the President of this place. The President. - Follow me. - Let me go. Follow me! Chef. I'm the President! Let me go! This is my restaurant. I can do what I want. No matter, no matter what I do, whether I give money or take it, it's mine. I am your President! Wake up, you bastard! You're fired. You're fired! Pretend all the customers are diabetic and make the pickles. Yes, Chef. I removed suspicion from you, I allowed you to hold the pan, and now I'm letting you make pickles, and that's all you have to say? You're the best, Chef. It doesn't work with me, as you know?. sucking up. Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Main Translator: songbird Spot Translator: meju Timer: julier Editor/QC: sayroo Coordinators: mily2, ay_link I must be crazy. Please. Aha! What now? - Let's go into business together. - I don't want to. I had something to say to you. I'm the most afraid of you. Try being first, okay? Don't think you're a third rate or a loser. What made you act so cocky? I'm warning you. You bought it? No need for unnecessary words? I'm closing the restaurant. - Chef. - Are you drunk? Chef! Chef! Can anyone help? Save him! She was very curious as to who the landlord was. Aren't you going to have a housewarming party? Inviting people from across the hall. Jung Ho Nam. Oh, you? what? If you're carrying on a romance in the kitchen, we'll break your back in half. Goodbye. Why don't you like me? You really don't know? Are you going to spend the night here?
